a, galaxy, is, a, system, of, stars, stellar, remnants, interstellar, gas, dust, and, dark, matter, bound, together, by, gravity, the, word, is, derived, from, the, greek, galaxias, literally, milky, a, reference, to, the, milky, way, galaxy, that, contains, the, solar, system, galaxies, averaging, an, estimated, 100, million, stars, range, in, size, from, dwarfs, with, less, than, a, thousand, stars, to, the, largest, galaxies, known, supergiants, with, one, hundred, trillion, stars, each, orbiting, its, galaxy, s, center, of, mass, most, of, the, mass, in, a, typical, galaxy, is, in, the, form, of, dark, matter, with, only, a, few, percent, of, that, mass, visible, in, the, form, of, stars, and, nebulae, supermassive, black, holes, are, a, common, feature, at, the, centres, of, galaxies, galaxies, are, categorised, according, to, their, visual, morphology, as, elliptical, spiral, or, irregular, the, milky, way, is, an, example, of, a, spiral, galaxy, it, is, estimated, that, there, are, between, 200, billion, 2, 10, 11, to, 2, trillion, galaxies, in, the, observable, universe, most, galaxies, are, 1, 000, to, 100, 000, parsecs, in, diameter, approximately, 3, 000, to, 300, 000, light, years, and, are, separated, by, distances, in, the, order, of, millions, of, parsecs, or, megaparsecs, for, comparison, the, milky, way, has, a, diameter, of, at, least, 26, 800, parsecs, 87, 400, ly, and, is, separated, from, the, andromeda, galaxy, its, nearest, large, neighbour, by, just, over, 750, 000, parsecs, 2, 5, million, ly, the, space, between, galaxies, is, filled, with, a, tenuous, gas, the, intergalactic, medium, with, an, average, density, of, less, than, one, atom, per, cubic, metre, most, galaxies, are, gravitationally, organised, into, groups, clusters, and, superclusters, the, milky, way, is, part, of, the, local, group, which, it, dominates, along, with, the, andromeda, galaxy, the, group, is, part, of, the, virgo, supercluster, at, the, largest, scale, these, associations, are, generally, arranged, into, sheets, and, filaments, surrounded, by, immense, voids, both, the, local, group, and, the, virgo, supercluster, are, contained, in, a, much, larger, cosmic, structure, named, laniakea, the, word, galaxy, was, borrowed, via, french, and, medieval, latin, from, the, greek, term, for, the, milky, way, galax, as, k, klos, milky, circle, named, after, its, appearance, as, a, milky, band, of, light, in, the, sky, in, greek, mythology, zeus, places, his, son, born, by, a, mortal, woman, the, infant, heracles, on, hera, s, breast, while, she, is, asleep, so, the, baby, will, drink, her, divine, milk, and, thus, become, immortal, hera, wakes, up, while, breastfeeding, and, then, realises, she, is, nursing, an, unknown, baby, she, pushes, the, baby, away, some, of, her, milk, spills, and, it, produces, the, band, of, light, known, as, the, milky, way, in, the, astronomical, literature, the, capitalised, word, galaxy, is, often, used, to, refer, to, the, milky, way, galaxy, to, distinguish, it, from, the, other, galaxies, in, the, observable, universe, the, english, term, milky, way, can, be, traced, back, to, a, story, by, geoffrey, chaucer, c, 1380, see, yonder, lo, the, galaxy, which, men, clepeth, the, milky, wey, for, hit, is, whyt, galaxies, were, initially, discovered, telescopically, and, were, known, as, spiral, nebulae, most, 18th, to, 19th, century, astronomers, considered, them, as, either, unresolved, star, clusters, or, anagalactic, nebulae, and, were, just, thought, of, as, a, part, of, the, milky, way, but, their, true, composition, and, natures, remained, a, mystery, observations, using, larger, telescopes, of, a, few, nearby, bright, galaxies, like, the, andromeda, galaxy, began, resolving, them, into, huge, conglomerations, of, stars, but, based, simply, on, the, apparent, faintness, and, sheer, population, of, stars, the, true, distances, of, these, objects, placed, them, well, beyond, the, milky, way, for, this, reason, they, were, popularly, called, island, universes, but, this, term, quickly, fell, into, disuse, as, the, word, universe, implied, the, entirety, of, existence, instead, they, became, known, simply, as, galaxies, millions, of, galaxies, have, been, catalogued, but, only, a, few, have, well, established, names, such, as, the, andromeda, galaxy, the, magellanic, clouds, the, whirlpool, galaxy, and, the, sombrero, galaxy, astronomers, work, with, numbers, from, certain, catalogues, such, as, the, messier, catalogue, the, ngc, new, general, catalogue, the, ic, index, catalogue, the, cgcg, catalogue, of, galaxies, and, of, clusters, of, galaxies, the, mcg, morphological, catalogue, of, galaxies, the, ugc, uppsala, general, catalogue, of, galaxies, and, the, pgc, catalogue, of, principal, galaxies, also, known, as, leda, all, the, well, known, galaxies, appear, in, one, or, more, of, these, catalogues, but, each, time, under, a, different, number, for, example, messier, 109, or, m109, is, a, spiral, galaxy, having, the, number, 109, in, the, catalogue, of, messier, it, also, has, the, designations, ngc, 3992, ugc, 6937, cgcg, 269, 023, mcg, 09, 20, 044, and, pgc, 37617, or, leda, 37617, among, others, millions, of, fainter, galaxies, are, known, by, their, identifiers, in, sky, surveys, such, as, the, sloan, digital, sky, survey, greek, philosopher, democritus, 450, 370, bce, proposed, that, the, bright, band, on, the, night, sky, known, as, the, milky, way, might, consist, of, distant, stars, aristotle, 384, 322, bce, however, believed, the, milky, way, was, caused, by, the, ignition, of, the, fiery, exhalation, of, some, stars, that, were, large, numerous, and, close, together, and, that, the, ignition, takes, place, in, the, upper, part, of, the, atmosphere, in, the, region, of, the, world, that, is, continuous, with, the, heavenly, motions, neoplatonist, philosopher, olympiodorus, the, younger, c, 495, 570, ce, was, critical, of, this, view, arguing, that, if, the, milky, way, was, sublunary, situated, between, earth, and, the, moon, it, should, appear, different, at, different, times, and, places, on, earth, and, that, it, should, have, parallax, which, it, did, not, in, his, view, the, milky, way, was, celestial, according, to, mohani, mohamed, arabian, astronomer, ibn, al, haytham, 965, 1037, made, the, first, attempt, at, observing, and, measuring, the, milky, way, s, parallax, and, he, thus, determined, that, because, the, milky, way, had, no, parallax, it, must, be, remote, from, the, earth, not, belonging, to, the, atmosphere, persian, astronomer, al, biruni, 973, 1048, proposed, the, milky, way, galaxy, was, a, collection, of, countless, fragments, of, the, nature, of, nebulous, stars, andalusian, astronomer, avempace, d, 1138, proposed, that, it, was, composed, of, many, stars, that, almost, touched, one, another, and, appeared, to, be, a, continuous, image, due, to, the, effect, of, refraction, from, sublunary, material, citing, his, observation, of, the, conjunction, of, jupiter, and, mars, as, evidence, of, this, occurring, when, two, objects, were, near, in, the, 14th, century, syrian, born, ibn, qayyim, al, jawziyya, proposed, the, milky, way, galaxy, was, a, myriad, of, tiny, stars, packed, together, in, the, sphere, of, the, fixed, stars, actual, proof, of, the, milky, way, consisting, of, many, stars, came, in, 1610, when, the, italian, astronomer, galileo, galilei, used, a, telescope, to, study, it, and, discovered, it, was, composed, of, a, huge, number, of, faint, stars, in, 1750, english, astronomer, thomas, wright, in, his, an, original, theory, or, new, hypothesis, of, the, universe, correctly, speculated, that, it, might, be, a, rotating, body, of, a, huge, number, of, stars, held, together, by, gravitational, forces, akin, to, the, solar, system, but, on, a, much, larger, scale, and, that, the, resulting, disk, of, stars, could, be, seen, as, a, band, on, the, sky, from, a, perspective, inside, it, in, his, 1755, treatise, immanuel, kant, elaborated, on, wright, s, idea, about, the, milky, way, s, structure, the, first, project, to, describe, the, shape, of, the, milky, way, and, the, position, of, the, sun, was, undertaken, by, william, herschel, in, 1785, by, counting, the, number, of, stars, in, different, regions, of, the, sky, he, produced, a, diagram, of, the, shape, of, the, galaxy, with, the, solar, system, close, to, the, center, using, a, refined, approach, kapteyn, in, 1920, arrived, at, the, picture, of, a, small, diameter, about, 15, kiloparsecs, ellipsoid, galaxy, with, the, sun, close, to, the, center, a, different, method, by, harlow, shapley, based, on, the, cataloguing, of, globular, clusters, led, to, a, radically, different, picture, a, flat, disk, with, diameter, approximately, 70, kiloparsecs, and, the, sun, far, from, the, centre, both, analyses, failed, to, take, into, account, the, absorption, of, light, by, interstellar, dust, present, in, the, galactic, plane, but, after, robert, julius, trumpler, quantified, this, effect, in, 1930, by, studying, open, clusters, the, present, picture, of, the, milky, way, galaxy, emerged, a, few, galaxies, outside, the, milky, way, are, visible, on, a, dark, night, to, the, unaided, eye, including, the, andromeda, galaxy, large, magellanic, cloud, small, magellanic, cloud, and, the, triangulum, galaxy, in, the, 10th, century, persian, astronomer, abd, al, rahman, al, sufi, made, the, earliest, recorded, identification, of, the, andromeda, galaxy, describing, it, as, a, small, cloud, in, 964, he, probably, mentioned, the, large, magellanic, cloud, in, his, book, of, fixed, stars, referring, to, al, bakr, of, the, southern, arabs, since, at, a, declination, of, about, 70, south, it, was, not, visible, where, he, lived, it, was, not, well, known, to, europeans, until, magellan, s, voyage, in, the, 16th, century, the, andromeda, galaxy, was, later, independently, noted, by, simon, marius, in, 1612, in, 1734, philosopher, emanuel, swedenborg, in, his, principia, speculated, that, there, might, be, other, galaxies, outside, that, were, formed, into, galactic, clusters, that, were, minuscule, parts, of, the, universe, that, extended, far, beyond, what, could, be, seen, these, views, are, remarkably, close, to, the, present, day, views, of, the, cosmos, in, 1745, pierre, louis, maupertuis, conjectured, that, some, nebula, like, objects, were, collections, of, stars, with, unique, properties, including, a, glow, exceeding, the, light, its, stars, produced, on, their, own, and, repeated, johannes, hevelius, s, view, that, the, bright, spots, were, massive, and, flattened, due, to, their, rotation, in, 1750, thomas, wright, correctly, speculated, that, the, milky, way, was, a, flattened, disk, of, stars, and, that, some, of, the, nebulae, visible, in, the, night, sky, might, be, separate, milky, ways, toward, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, charles, messier, compiled, a, catalog, containing, the, 109, brightest, celestial, objects, having, nebulous, appearance, subsequently, william, herschel, assembled, a, catalog, of, 5, 000, nebulae, in, 1845, lord, rosse, examined, the, nebulae, catalogued, by, herschel, and, observed, the, spiral, structure, of, messier, object, m51, now, known, as, the, whirlpool, galaxy, in, 1912, vesto, m, slipher, made, spectrographic, studies, of, the, brightest, spiral, nebulae, to, determine, their, composition, slipher, discovered, that, the, spiral, nebulae, have, high, doppler, shifts, indicating, that, they, are, moving, at, a, rate, exceeding, the, velocity, of, the, stars, he, had, measured, he, found, that, the, majority, of, these, nebulae, are, moving, away, from, us, in, 1917, heber, doust, curtis, observed, nova, s, andromedae, within, the, great, andromeda, nebula, as, the, andromeda, galaxy, messier, object, m31, was, then, known, searching, the, photographic, record, he, found, 11, more, novae, curtis, noticed, that, these, novae, were, on, average, 10, magnitudes, fainter, than, those, that, occurred, within, this, galaxy, as, a, result, he, was, able, to, come, up, with, a, distance, estimate, of, 150, 000, parsecs, he, became, a, proponent, of, the, so, called, island, universes, hypothesis, which, holds, that, spiral, nebulae, are, actually, independent, galaxies, in, 1920, a, debate, took, place, between, harlow, shapley, and, heber, curtis, the, great, debate, concerning, the, nature, of, the, milky, way, spiral, nebulae, and, the, dimensions, of, the, universe, to, support, his, claim, that, the, great, andromeda, nebula, is, an, external, galaxy, curtis, noted, the, appearance, of, dark, lanes, resembling, the, dust, clouds, in, the, milky, way, as, well, as, the, significant, doppler, shift, in, 1922, the, estonian, astronomer, ernst, pik, gave, a, distance, determination, that, supported, the, theory, that, the, andromeda, nebula, is, indeed, a, distant, extra, galactic, object, using, the, new, 100, inch, mt, wilson, telescope, edwin, hubble, was, able, to, resolve, the, outer, parts, of, some, spiral, nebulae, as, collections, of, individual, stars, and, identified, some, cepheid, variables, thus, allowing, him, to, estimate, the, distance, to, the, nebulae, they, were, far, too, distant, to, be, part, of, the, milky, way, in, 1926, hubble, produced, a, classification, of, galactic, morphology, that, is, used, to, this, day, advances, in, astronomy, have, always, been, driven, by, technology, after, centuries, of, success, in, optical, astronomy, recent, decades, have, seen, major, progress, in, other, regions, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, the, dust, present, in, the, interstellar, medium, is, opaque, to, visual, light, it, is, more, transparent, to, far, infrared, which, can, be, used, to, observe, the, interior, regions, of, giant, molecular, clouds, and, galactic, cores, in, great, detail, infrared, is, also, used, to, observe, distant, red, shifted, galaxies, that, were, formed, much, earlier, water, vapor, and, carbon, dioxide, absorb, a, number, of, useful, portions, of, the, infrared, spectrum, so, high, altitude, or, space, based, telescopes, are, used, for, infrared, astronomy, the, first, non, visual, study, of, galaxies, particularly, active, galaxies, was, made, using, radio, frequencies, the, earth, s, atmosphere, is, nearly, transparent, to, radio, between, 5, mhz, and, 30, ghz, the, ionosphere, blocks, signals, below, this, range, large, radio, interferometers, have, been, used, to, map, the, active, jets, emitted, from, active, nuclei, ultraviolet, and, x, ray, telescopes, can, observe, highly, energetic, galactic, phenomena, ultraviolet, flares, are, sometimes, observed, when, a, star, in, a, distant, galaxy, is, torn, apart, from, the, tidal, forces, of, a, nearby, black, hole, the, distribution, of, hot, gas, in, galactic, clusters, can, be, mapped, by, x, rays, the, existence, of, supermassive, black, holes, at, the, cores, of, galaxies, was, confirmed, through, x, ray, astronomy, in, 1944, hendrik, van, de, hulst, predicted, that, microwave, radiation, with, wavelength, of, 21, cm, would, be, detectable, from, interstellar, atomic, hydrogen, gas, and, in, 1951, it, was, observed, this, radiation, is, not, affected, by, dust, absorption, and, so, its, doppler, shift, can, be, used, to, map, the, motion, of, the, gas, in, this, galaxy, these, observations, led, to, the, hypothesis, of, a, rotating, bar, structure, in, the, center, of, this, galaxy, with, improved, radio, telescopes, hydrogen, gas, could, also, be, traced, in, other, galaxies, in, the, 1970s, vera, rubin, uncovered, a, discrepancy, between, observed, galactic, rotation, speed, and, that, predicted, by, the, visible, mass, of, stars, and, gas, today, the, galaxy, rotation, problem, is, thought, to, be, explained, by, the, presence, of, large, quantities, of, unseen, dark, matter, beginning, in, the, 1990s, the, hubble, space, telescope, yielded, improved, observations, among, other, things, its, data, helped, establish, that, the, missing, dark, matter, in, this, galaxy, could, not, consist, solely, of, inherently, faint, and, small, stars, the, hubble, deep, field, an, extremely, long, exposure, of, a, relatively, empty, part, of, the, sky, provided, evidence, that, there, are, about, 125, billion, 1, 25, 10, 11, galaxies, in, the, observable, universe, improved, technology, in, detecting, the, spectra, invisible, to, humans, radio, telescopes, infrared, cameras, and, x, ray, telescopes, allows, detection, of, other, galaxies, that, are, not, detected, by, hubble, particularly, surveys, in, the, zone, of, avoidance, the, region, of, sky, blocked, at, visible, light, wavelengths, by, the, milky, way, have, revealed, a, number, of, new, galaxies, a, 2016, study, published, in, the, astrophysical, journal, led, by, christopher, conselice, of, the, university, of, nottingham, used, 20, years, of, hubble, images, to, estimate, that, the, observable, universe, contained, at, least, two, trillion, 2, 10, 12, galaxies, however, later, observations, with, the, new, horizons, space, probe, from, outside, the, zodiacal, light, reduced, this, to, roughly, 200, billion, 2, 10, 11, galaxies, come, in, three, main, types, ellipticals, spirals, and, irregulars, a, slightly, more, extensive, description, of, galaxy, types, based, on, their, appearance, is, given, by, the, hubble, sequence, since, the, hubble, sequence, is, entirely, based, upon, visual, morphological, type, shape, it, may, miss, certain, important, characteristics, of, galaxies, such, as, star, formation, rate, in, starburst, galaxies, and, activity, in, the, cores, of, active, galaxies, many, galaxies, are, thought, to, contain, a, supermassive, black, hole, at, their, center, this, includes, the, milky, way, whose, core, region, is, called, the, galactic, center, the, hubble, classification, system, rates, elliptical, galaxies, on, the, basis, of, their, ellipticity, ranging, from, e0, being, nearly, spherical, up, to, e7, which, is, highly, elongated, these, galaxies, have, an, ellipsoidal, profile, giving, them, an, elliptical, appearance, regardless, of, the, viewing, angle, their, appearance, shows, little, structure, and, they, typically, have, relatively, little, interstellar, matter, consequently, these, galaxies, also, have, a, low, portion, of, open, clusters, and, a, reduced, rate, of, new, star, formation, instead, they, are, dominated, by, generally, older, more, evolved, stars, that, are, orbiting, the, common, center, of, gravity, in, random, directions, the, stars, contain, low, abundances, of, heavy, elements, because, star, formation, ceases, after, the, initial, burst, in, this, sense, they, have, some, similarity, to, the, much, smaller, globular, clusters, the, largest, galaxies, are, the, type, cd, galaxies, first, described, in, 1964, by, a, paper, by, thomas, a, matthews, and, others, they, are, a, subtype, of, the, more, general, class, of, d, galaxies, which, are, giant, elliptical, galaxies, except, that, they, are, much, larger, they, are, popularly, known, as, the, supergiant, elliptical, galaxies, and, constitute, the, largest, and, most, luminous, galaxies, known, these, galaxies, feature, a, central, elliptical, nucleus, with, an, extensive, faint, halo, of, stars, extending, to, megaparsec, scales, the, profile, of, their, surface, brightnesses, as, a, function, of, their, radius, or, distance, from, their, cores, falls, off, more, slowly, than, their, smaller, counterparts, the, formation, of, these, cd, galaxies, remains, an, active, area, of, research, but, the, leading, model, is, that, they, are, the, result, of, the, mergers, of, smaller, galaxies, in, the, environments, of, dense, clusters, or, even, those, outside, of, clusters, with, random, overdensities, these, processes, are, the, mechanisms, that, drive, the, formation, of, fossil, groups, or, fossil, clusters, where, a, large, relatively, isolated, supergiant, elliptical, resides, in, the, middle, of, the, cluster, and, are, surrounded, by, an, extensive, cloud, of, x, rays, as, the, residue, of, these, galactic, collisions, another, older, model, posits, the, phenomenon, of, cooling, flow, where, the, heated, gases, in, clusters, collapses, towards, their, centers, as, they, cool, forming, stars, in, the, process, a, phenomenon, observed, in, clusters, such, as, perseus, and, more, recently, in, the, phoenix, cluster, a, shell, galaxy, is, a, type, of, elliptical, galaxy, where, the, stars, in, its, halo, are, arranged, in, concentric, shells, about, one, tenth, of, elliptical, galaxies, have, a, shell, like, structure, which, has, never, been, observed, in, spiral, galaxies, these, structures, are, thought, to, develop, when, a, larger, galaxy, absorbs, a, smaller, companion, galaxy, that, as, the, two, galaxy, centers, approach, they, start, to, oscillate, around, a, center, point, and, the, oscillation, creates, gravitational, ripples, forming, the, shells, of, stars, similar, to, ripples, spreading, on, water, for, example, galaxy, ngc, 3923, has, over, 20, shells, spiral, galaxies, resemble, spiraling, pinwheels, though, the, stars, and, other, visible, material, contained, in, such, a, galaxy, lie, mostly, on, a, plane, the, majority, of, mass, in, spiral, galaxies, exists, in, a, roughly, spherical, halo, of, dark, matter, which, extends, beyond, the, visible, component, as, demonstrated, by, the, universal, rotation, curve, concept, spiral, galaxies, consist, of, a, rotating, disk, of, stars, and, interstellar, medium, along, with, a, central, bulge, of, generally, older, stars, extending, outward, from, the, bulge, are, relatively, bright, arms, in, the, hubble, classification, scheme, spiral, galaxies, are, listed, as, type, s, followed, by, a, letter, a, b, or, c, which, indicates, the, degree, of, tightness, of, the, spiral, arms, and, the, size, of, the, central, bulge, an, sa, galaxy, has, tightly, wound, poorly, defined, arms, and, possesses, a, relatively, large, core, region, at, the, other, extreme, an, sc, galaxy, has, open, well, defined, arms, and, a, small, core, region, a, galaxy, with, poorly, defined, arms, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, flocculent, spiral, galaxy, in, contrast, to, the, grand, design, spiral, galaxy, that, has, prominent, and, well, defined, spiral, arms, the, speed, in, which, a, galaxy, rotates, is, thought, to, correlate, with, the, flatness, of, the, disc, as, some, spiral, galaxies, have, thick, bulges, while, others, are, thin, and, dense, in, spiral, galaxies, the, spiral, arms, do, have, the, shape, of, approximate, logarithmic, spirals, a, pattern, that, can, be, theoretically, shown, to, result, from, a, disturbance, in, a, uniformly, rotating, mass, of, stars, like, the, stars, the, spiral, arms, rotate, around, the, center, but, they, do, so, with, constant, angular, velocity, the, spiral, arms, are, thought, to, be, areas, of, high, density, matter, or, density, waves, as, stars, move, through, an, arm, the, space, velocity, of, each, stellar, system, is, modified, by, the, gravitational, force, of, the, higher, density, the, velocity, returns, to, normal, after, the, stars, depart, on, the, other, side, of, the, arm, this, effect, is, akin, to, a, wave, of, slowdowns, moving, along, a, highway, full, of, moving, cars, the, arms, are, visible, because, the, high, density, facilitates, star, formation, and, therefore, they, harbor, many, bright, and, young, stars, a, majority, of, spiral, galaxies, including, the, milky, way, galaxy, have, a, linear, bar, shaped, band, of, stars, that, extends, outward, to, either, side, of, the, core, then, merges, into, the, spiral, arm, structure, in, the, hubble, classification, scheme, these, are, designated, by, an, sb, followed, by, a, lower, case, letter, a, b, or, c, which, indicates, the, form, of, the, spiral, arms, in, the, same, manner, as, the, categorization, of, normal, spiral, galaxies, bars, are, thought, to, be, temporary, structures, that, can, occur, as, a, result, of, a, density, wave, radiating, outward, from, the, core, or, else, due, to, a, tidal, interaction, with, another, galaxy, many, barred, spiral, galaxies, are, active, possibly, as, a, result, of, gas, being, channeled, into, the, core, along, the, arms, our, own, galaxy, the, milky, way, is, a, large, disk, shaped, barred, spiral, galaxy, about, 30, kiloparsecs, in, diameter, and, a, kiloparsec, thick, it, contains, about, two, hundred, billion, 2, 10, 11, stars, and, has, a, total, mass, of, about, six, hundred, billion, 6, 10, 11, times, the, mass, of, the, sun, recently, researchers, described, galaxies, called, super, luminous, spirals, they, are, very, large, with, an, upward, diameter, of, 437, 000, light, years, compared, to, the, milky, way, s, 87, 400, light, year, diameter, with, a, mass, of, 340, billion, solar, masses, they, generate, a, significant, amount, of, ultraviolet, and, mid, infrared, light, they, are, thought, to, have, an, increased, star, formation, rate, around, 30, times, faster, than, the, milky, way, despite, the, prominence, of, large, elliptical, and, spiral, galaxies, most, galaxies, are, dwarf, galaxies, they, are, relatively, small, when, compared, with, other, galactic, formations, being, about, one, hundredth, the, size, of, the, milky, way, with, only, a, few, billion, stars, blue, compact, dwarf, galaxies, contains, large, clusters, of, young, hot, massive, stars, ultra, compact, dwarf, galaxies, have, been, discovered, that, are, only, 100, parsecs, across, many, dwarf, galaxies, may, orbit, a, single, larger, galaxy, the, milky, way, has, at, least, a, dozen, such, satellites, with, an, estimated, 300, 500, yet, to, be, discovered, most, of, the, information, we, have, about, dwarf, galaxies, come, from, observations, of, the, local, group, containing, two, spiral, galaxies, the, milky, way, and, andromeda, and, many, dwarf, galaxies, these, dwarf, galaxies, are, classified, as, either, irregular, or, dwarf, elliptical, dwarf, spheroidal, galaxies, a, study, of, 27, milky, way, neighbors, found, that, in, all, dwarf, galaxies, the, central, mass, is, approximately, 10, million, solar, masses, regardless, of, whether, it, has, thousands, or, millions, of, stars, this, suggests, that, galaxies, are, largely, formed, by, dark, matter, and, that, the, minimum, size, may, indicate, a, form, of, warm, dark, matter, incapable, of, gravitational, coalescence, on, a, smaller, scale, interactions, between, galaxies, are, relatively, frequent, and, they, can, play, an, important, role, in, galactic, evolution, near, misses, between, galaxies, result, in, warping, distortions, due, to, tidal, interactions, and, may, cause, some, exchange, of, gas, and, dust, collisions, occur, when, two, galaxies, pass, directly, through, each, other, and, have, sufficient, relative, momentum, not, to, merge, the, stars, of, interacting, galaxies, usually, do, not, collide, but, the, gas, and, dust, within, the, two, forms, interacts, sometimes, triggering, star, formation, a, collision, can, severely, distort, the, galaxies, shapes, forming, bars, rings, or, tail, like, structures, at, the, extreme, of, interactions, are, galactic, mergers, where, the, galaxies, relative, momentums, are, insufficient, to, allow, them, to, pass, through, each, other, instead, they, gradually, merge, to, form, a, single, larger, galaxy, mergers, can, result, in, significant, changes, to, the, galaxies, original, morphology, if, one, of, the, galaxies, is, much, more, massive, than, the, other, the, result, is, known, as, cannibalism, where, the, more, massive, larger, galaxy, remains, relatively, undisturbed, and, the, smaller, one, is, torn, apart, the, milky, way, galaxy, is, currently, in, the, process, of, cannibalizing, the, sagittarius, dwarf, elliptical, galaxy, and, the, canis, major, dwarf, galaxy, stars, are, created, within, galaxies, from, a, reserve, of, cold, gas, that, forms, giant, molecular, clouds, some, galaxies, have, been, observed, to, form, stars, at, an, exceptional, rate, which, is, known, as, a, starburst, if, they, continue, to, do, so, they, would, consume, their, reserve, of, gas, in, a, time, span, less, than, the, galaxy, s, lifespan, hence, starburst, activity, usually, lasts, only, about, ten, million, years, a, relatively, brief, period, in, a, galaxy, s, history, starburst, galaxies, were, more, common, during, the, universe, s, early, history, but, still, contribute, an, estimated, 15, to, total, star, production, starburst, galaxies, are, characterized, by, dusty, concentrations, of, gas, and, the, appearance, of, newly, formed, stars, including, massive, stars, that, ionize, the, surrounding, clouds, to, create, h, ii, regions, these, stars, produce, supernova, explosions, creating, expanding, remnants, that, interact, powerfully, with, the, surrounding, gas, these, outbursts, trigger, a, chain, reaction, of, star, building, that, spreads, throughout, the, gaseous, region, only, when, the, available, gas, is, nearly, consumed, or, dispersed, does, the, activity, end, starbursts, are, often, associated, with, merging, or, interacting, galaxies, the, prototype, example, of, such, a, starburst, forming, interaction, is, m82, which, experienced, a, close, encounter, with, the, larger, m81, irregular, galaxies, often, exhibit, spaced, knots, of, starburst, activity, a, radio, galaxy, is, a, galaxy, with, giant, regions, of, radio, emission, extending, well, beyond, its, visible, structure, these, energetic, radio, lobes, are, powered, by, jets, from, its, active, galactic, nucleus, radio, galaxies, are, classified, according, to, their, fanaroff, riley, classification, the, fr, i, class, have, lower, radio, luminosity, and, exhibit, structures, which, are, more, elongated, the, fr, ii, class, are, higher, radio, luminosity, the, correlation, of, radio, luminosity, and, structure, suggests, that, the, sources, in, these, two, types, of, galaxies, may, differ, radio, galaxies, can, also, be, classified, as, giant, radio, galaxies, grgs, whose, radio, emissions, can, extend, to, scales, of, megaparsecs, 3, 26, million, light, years, alcyoneus, is, an, fr, ii, class, low, excitation, radio, galaxy, which, has, the, largest, observed, radio, emission, with, lobed, structures, spanning, 5, megaparsecs, 16, 10, 6, ly, for, comparison, another, similarly, sized, giant, radio, galaxy, is, 3c, 236, with, lobes, 15, million, light, years, across, it, should, however, be, noted, that, radio, emissions, are, not, always, considered, part, of, the, main, galaxy, itself, a, giant, radio, galaxy, is, a, special, class, of, objects, characterized, by, the, presence, of, radio, lobes, generated, by, relativistic, jets, powered, by, the, central, galaxy, s, supermassive, black, hole, giant, radio, galaxies, are, different, from, ordinary, radio, galaxies, in, that, they, can, extend, to, much, larger, scales, reaching, upwards, to, several, megaparsecs, across, far, larger, than, the, diameters, of, their, host, galaxies, a, normal, radio, galaxy, do, not, have, a, source, that, is, a, supermassive, black, hole, or, monster, neutron, star, instead, the, source, is, synchrotron, radiation, from, relativistic, electrons, accelerated, by, supernova, these, sources, are, comparatively, short, lived, making, the, radio, spectrum, from, normal, radio, galaxies, an, especially, good, way, to, study, star, formation, some, observable, galaxies, are, classified, as, active, if, they, contain, an, active, galactic, nucleus, agn, a, significant, portion, of, the, galaxy, s, total, energy, output, is, emitted, by, the, active, nucleus, instead, of, its, stars, dust, and, interstellar, medium, there, are, multiple, classification, and, naming, schemes, for, agns, but, those, in, the, lower, ranges, of, luminosity, are, called, seyfert, galaxies, while, those, with, luminosities, much, greater, than, that, of, the, host, galaxy, are, known, as, quasi, stellar, objects, or, quasars, models, of, agns, suggest, that, a, significant, fraction, of, their, light, is, shifted, to, far, infrared, frequencies, because, optical, and, uv, emission, in, the, nucleus, is, absorbed, and, remitted, by, dust, and, gas, surrounding, it, the, standard, model, for, an, active, galactic, nucleus, is, based, on, an, accretion, disc, that, forms, around, a, supermassive, black, hole, smbh, at, the, galaxy, s, core, region, the, radiation, from, an, active, galactic, nucleus, results, from, the, gravitational, energy, of, matter, as, it, falls, toward, the, black, hole, from, the, disc, the, agn, s, luminosity, depends, on, the, smbh, s, mass, and, the, rate, at, which, matter, falls, onto, it, in, about, 10, of, these, galaxies, a, diametrically, opposed, pair, of, energetic, jets, ejects, particles, from, the, galaxy, core, at, velocities, close, to, the, speed, of, light, the, mechanism, for, producing, these, jets, is, not, well, understood, seyfert, galaxies, are, one, of, the, two, largest, groups, of, active, galaxies, along, with, quasars, they, have, quasar, like, nuclei, very, luminous, distant, and, bright, sources, of, electromagnetic, radiation, with, very, high, surface, brightnesses, but, unlike, quasars, their, host, galaxies, are, clearly, detectable, seen, through, a, telescope, a, seyfert, galaxy, appears, like, an, ordinary, galaxy, with, a, bright, star, superimposed, atop, the, core, seyfert, galaxies, are, divided, into, two, principal, subtypes, based, on, the, frequencies, observed, in, their, spectra, quasars, are, the, most, energetic, and, distant, members, of, active, galactic, nuclei, extremely, luminous, they, were, first, identified, as, high, redshift, sources, of, electromagnetic, energy, including, radio, waves, and, visible, light, that, appeared, more, similar, to, stars, than, to, extended, sources, similar, to, galaxies, their, luminosity, can, be, 100, times, that, of, the, milky, way, the, nearest, known, quasar, markarian, 231, is, about, 581, million, light, years, from, earth, while, others, have, been, discovered, as, far, away, as, uhz1, roughly, 13, 2, billion, light, years, distant, quasars, are, noteworthy, for, providing, the, first, demonstration, of, the, phenomenon, that, gravity, can, act, as, a, lens, for, light, blazars, are, believed, to, be, active, galaxies, with, a, relativistic, jet, pointed, in, the, direction, of, earth, a, radio, galaxy, emits, radio, frequencies, from, relativistic, jets, a, unified, model, of, these, types, of, active, galaxies, explains, their, differences, based, on, the, observer, s, position, possibly, related, to, active, galactic, nuclei, as, well, as, starburst, regions, are, low, ionization, nuclear, emission, line, regions, liners, the, emission, from, liner, type, galaxies, is, dominated, by, weakly, ionized, elements, the, excitation, sources, for, the, weakly, ionized, lines, include, post, agb, stars, agn, and, shocks, approximately, one, third, of, nearby, galaxies, are, classified, as, containing, liner, nuclei, luminous, infrared, galaxies, lirgs, are, galaxies, with, luminosities, the, measurement, of, electromagnetic, power, output, above, 10, 11, l, solar, luminosities, in, most, cases, most, of, their, energy, comes, from, large, numbers, of, young, stars, which, heat, surrounding, dust, which, reradiates, the, energy, in, the, infrared, luminosity, high, enough, to, be, a, lirg, requires, a, star, formation, rate, of, at, least, 18, m, yr, 1, ultra, luminous, infrared, galaxies, ulirgs, are, at, least, ten, times, more, luminous, still, and, form, stars, at, rates, 180, m, yr, 1, many, lirgs, also, emit, radiation, from, an, agn, infrared, galaxies, emit, more, energy, in, the, infrared, than, all, other, wavelengths, combined, with, peak, emission, typically, at, wavelengths, of, 60, to, 100, microns, lirgs, are, believed, to, be, created, from, the, strong, interaction, and, merger, of, spiral, galaxies, while, uncommon, in, the, local, universe, lirgs, and, ulirgs, were, more, prevalent, when, the, universe, was, younger, galaxies, do, not, have, a, definite, boundary, by, their, nature, and, are, characterized, by, a, gradually, decreasing, stellar, density, as, a, function, of, increasing, distance, from, their, center, making, measurements, of, their, true, extents, difficult, nevertheless, astronomers, over, the, past, few, decades, have, made, several, criteria, in, defining, the, sizes, of, galaxies, as, early, as, the, time, of, edwin, hubble, in, 1936, there, have, been, attempts, to, characterize, the, diameters, of, galaxies, the, earliest, efforts, were, based, on, the, observed, angle, subtended, by, the, galaxy, and, its, estimated, distance, leading, to, an, angular, diameter, also, called, metric, diameter, this, type, of, measurement, is, subject, to, two, significant, issues, namely, that, the, estimated, distance, to, the, galaxy, must, be, corrected, for, the, redshift, related, space, expansion, and, that, collections, of, angular, diameter, data, are, subject, to, selection, bias, as, more, distant, observations, preferentially, select, the, most, luminous, objects, the, isophotal, diameter, is, introduced, as, a, conventional, way, of, measuring, a, galaxy, s, size, based, on, its, apparent, surface, brightness, isophotes, are, curves, in, a, diagram, such, as, a, picture, of, a, galaxy, that, adjoins, points, of, equal, brightnesses, and, are, useful, in, defining, the, extent, of, the, galaxy, the, apparent, brightness, flux, of, a, galaxy, is, measured, in, units, of, magnitudes, per, square, arcsecond, mag, arcsec, 2, sometimes, expressed, as, mag, arcsec, 2, which, defines, the, brightness, depth, of, the, isophote, to, illustrate, how, this, unit, works, a, typical, galaxy, has, a, brightness, flux, of, 18, mag, arcsec, 2, at, its, central, region, this, brightness, is, equivalent, to, the, light, of, an, 18th, magnitude, hypothetical, point, object, like, a, star, being, spread, out, evenly, in, a, one, square, arcsecond, area, of, the, sky, the, isophotal, diameter, is, typically, defined, as, the, region, enclosing, all, the, light, down, to, 25, mag, arcsec, 2, in, the, blue, b, band, which, is, then, referred, to, as, the, d, 25, standard, the, half, light, radius, also, known, as, effective, radius, r, e, is, a, measure, that, is, based, on, the, galaxy, s, overall, brightness, flux, this, is, the, radius, upon, which, half, or, 50, of, the, total, brightness, flux, of, the, galaxy, was, emitted, this, was, first, proposed, by, g, rard, de, vaucouleurs, in, 1948, the, choice, of, using, 50, was, arbitrary, but, proved, to, be, useful, in, further, works, by, r, a, fish, in, 1963, where, he, established, a, luminosity, concentration, law, that, relates, the, brightnesses, of, elliptical, galaxies, and, their, respective, r, e, and, by, jos, luis, s, rsic, in, 1968, that, defined, a, mass, radius, relation, in, galaxies, in, defining, r, e, it, is, necessary, that, the, overall, brightness, flux, galaxy, should, be, captured, with, a, method, employed, by, bershady, in, 2000, suggesting, to, measure, twice, the, size, where, the, brightness, flux, of, an, arbitrarily, chosen, radius, defined, as, the, local, flux, divided, by, the, overall, average, flux, equals, to, 0, 2, using, half, light, radius, allows, a, rough, estimate, of, a, galaxy, s, size, but, is, not, particularly, helpful, in, determining, its, morphology, variations, of, this, method, exist, in, particular, in, the, eso, uppsala, catalogue, of, galaxies, values, of, 50, 70, and, 90, of, the, total, blue, light, the, light, detected, through, a, b, band, specific, filter, had, been, used, to, calculate, a, galaxy, s, diameter, first, described, by, vahe, petrosian, in, 1976, a, modified, version, of, this, method, has, been, used, by, the, sloan, digital, sky, survey, sdss, this, method, employs, a, mathematical, model, on, a, galaxy, whose, radius, is, determined, by, the, azimuthally, horizontal, averaged, profile, of, its, brightness, flux, in, particular, the, sdss, employed, the, petrosian, magnitude, in, the, r, band, 658, nm, in, the, red, part, of, the, visible, spectrum, to, ensure, that, the, brightness, flux, of, a, galaxy, would, be, captured, as, much, as, possible, while, counteracting, the, effects, of, background, noise, for, a, galaxy, whose, brightness, profile, is, exponential, it, is, expected, to, capture, all, of, its, brightness, flux, and, 80, for, galaxies, that, follow, a, profile, that, follows, de, vaucouleurs, s, law, petrosian, magnitudes, have, the, advantage, of, being, redshift, and, distance, independent, allowing, the, measurement, of, the, galaxy, s, apparent, size, since, the, petrosian, radius, is, defined, in, terms, of, the, galaxy, s, overall, luminous, flux, a, critique, of, an, earlier, version, of, this, method, has, been, issued, by, the, infrared, processing, and, analysis, center, with, the, method, causing, a, magnitude, of, error, upwards, to, 10, of, the, values, than, using, isophotal, diameter, the, use, of, petrosian, magnitudes, also, have, the, disadvantage, of, missing, most, of, the, light, outside, the, petrosian, aperture, which, is, defined, relative, to, the, galaxy, s, overall, brightness, profile, especially, for, elliptical, galaxies, with, higher, signal, to, noise, ratios, on, higher, distances, and, redshifts, a, correction, for, this, method, has, been, issued, by, graham, et, al, in, 2005, based, on, the, assumption, that, galaxies, follow, s, rsic, s, law, this, method, has, been, used, by, 2mass, as, an, adaptation, from, the, previously, used, methods, of, isophotal, measurement, since, 2mass, operates, in, the, near, infrared, which, has, the, advantage, of, being, able, to, recognize, dimmer, cooler, and, older, stars, it, has, a, different, form, of, approach, compared, to, other, methods, that, normally, use, b, filter, the, detail, of, the, method, used, by, 2mass, has, been, described, thoroughly, in, a, document, by, jarrett, et, al, with, the, survey, measuring, several, parameters, the, standard, aperture, ellipse, area, of, detection, is, defined, by, the, infrared, isophote, at, the, k, s, band, roughly, 2, 2, m, wavelength, of, 20, mag, arcsec, 2, gathering, the, overall, luminous, flux, of, the, galaxy, has, been, employed, by, at, least, four, methods, the, first, being, a, circular, aperture, extending, 7, arcseconds, from, the, center, an, isophote, at, 20, mag, arcsec, 2, a, total, aperture, defined, by, the, radial, light, distribution, that, covers, the, supposed, extent, of, the, galaxy, and, the, kron, aperture, defined, as, 2, 5, times, the, first, moment, radius, an, integration, of, the, flux, of, the, total, aperture, deep, sky, surveys, show, that, galaxies, are, often, found, in, groups, and, clusters, solitary, galaxies, that, have, not, significantly, interacted, with, other, galaxies, of, comparable, mass, in, the, past, few, billion, years, are, relatively, scarce, only, about, 5, of, the, galaxies, surveyed, are, isolated, in, this, sense, however, they, may, have, interacted, and, even, merged, with, other, galaxies, in, the, past, and, may, still, be, orbited, by, smaller, satellite, galaxies, on, the, largest, scale, the, universe, is, continually, expanding, resulting, in, an, average, increase, in, the, separation, between, individual, galaxies, see, hubble, s, law, associations, of, galaxies, can, overcome, this, expansion, on, a, local, scale, through, their, mutual, gravitational, attraction, these, associations, formed, early, as, clumps, of, dark, matter, pulled, their, respective, galaxies, together, nearby, groups, later, merged, to, form, larger, scale, clusters, this, ongoing, merging, process, as, well, as, an, influx, of, infalling, gas, heats, the, intergalactic, gas, in, a, cluster, to, very, high, temperatures, of, 30, 100, megakelvins, about, 70, 80, of, a, cluster, s, mass, is, in, the, form, of, dark, matter, with, 10, 30, consisting, of, this, heated, gas, and, the, remaining, few, percent, in, the, form, of, galaxies, most, galaxies, are, gravitationally, bound, to, a, number, of, other, galaxies, these, form, a, fractal, like, hierarchical, distribution, of, clustered, structures, with, the, smallest, such, associations, being, termed, groups, a, group, of, galaxies, is, the, most, common, type, of, galactic, cluster, these, formations, contain, the, majority, of, galaxies, as, well, as, most, of, the, baryonic, mass, in, the, universe, to, remain, gravitationally, bound, to, such, a, group, each, member, galaxy, must, have, a, sufficiently, low, velocity, to, prevent, it, from, escaping, see, virial, theorem, if, there, is, insufficient, kinetic, energy, however, the, group, may, evolve, into, a, smaller, number, of, galaxies, through, mergers, clusters, of, galaxies, consist, of, hundreds, to, thousands, of, galaxies, bound, together, by, gravity, clusters, of, galaxies, are, often, dominated, by, a, single, giant, elliptical, galaxy, known, as, the, brightest, cluster, galaxy, which, over, time, tidally, destroys, its, satellite, galaxies, and, adds, their, mass, to, its, own, superclusters, contain, tens, of, thousands, of, galaxies, which, are, found, in, clusters, groups, and, sometimes, individually, at, the, supercluster, scale, galaxies, are, arranged, into, sheets, and, filaments, surrounding, vast, empty, voids, above, this, scale, the, universe, appears, to, be, the, same, in, all, directions, isotropic, and, homogeneous, though, this, notion, has, been, challenged, in, recent, years, by, numerous, findings, of, large, scale, structures, that, appear, to, be, exceeding, this, scale, the, hercules, corona, borealis, great, wall, currently, the, largest, structure, in, the, universe, found, so, far, is, 10, billion, light, years, three, gigaparsecs, in, length, the, milky, way, galaxy, is, a, member, of, an, association, named, the, local, group, a, relatively, small, group, of, galaxies, that, has, a, diameter, of, approximately, one, megaparsec, the, milky, way, and, the, andromeda, galaxy, are, the, two, brightest, galaxies, within, the, group, many, of, the, other, member, galaxies, are, dwarf, companions, of, these, two, the, local, group, itself, is, a, part, of, a, cloud, like, structure, within, the, virgo, supercluster, a, large, extended, structure, of, groups, and, clusters, of, galaxies, centered, on, the, virgo, cluster, in, turn, the, virgo, supercluster, is, a, portion, of, the, laniakea, supercluster, galaxies, have, magnetic, fields, of, their, own, a, galaxy, s, magnetic, field, influences, its, dynamics, in, multiple, ways, including, affecting, the, formation, of, spiral, arms, and, transporting, angular, momentum, in, gas, clouds, the, latter, effect, is, particularly, important, as, it, is, a, necessary, factor, for, the, gravitational, collapse, of, those, clouds, and, thus, for, star, formation, the, typical, average, equipartition, strength, for, spiral, galaxies, is, about, 10, g, microgauss, or, 1, nt, nanotesla, by, comparison, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, has, an, average, strength, of, about, 0, 3, g, gauss, or, 30, t, microtesla, radio, faint, galaxies, like, m, 31, and, m33, the, milky, way, s, neighbors, have, weaker, fields, about, 5, g, while, gas, rich, galaxies, with, high, star, formation, rates, like, m, 51, m, 83, and, ngc, 6946, have, 15, g, on, average, in, prominent, spiral, arms, the, field, strength, can, be, up, to, 25, g, in, regions, where, cold, gas, and, dust, are, also, concentrated, the, strongest, total, equipartition, fields, 50, 100, g, were, found, in, starburst, galaxies, for, example, in, m, 82, and, the, antennae, and, in, nuclear, starburst, regions, such, as, the, centers, of, ngc, 1097, and, other, barred, galaxies, current, models, of, the, formation, of, galaxies, in, the, early, universe, are, based, on, the, cdm, model, about, 300, 000, years, after, the, big, bang, atoms, of, hydrogen, and, helium, began, to, form, in, an, event, called, recombination, nearly, all, the, hydrogen, was, neutral, non, ionized, and, readily, absorbed, light, and, no, stars, had, yet, formed, as, a, result, this, period, has, been, called, the, dark, ages, it, was, from, density, fluctuations, or, anisotropic, irregularities, in, this, primordial, matter, that, larger, structures, began, to, appear, as, a, result, masses, of, baryonic, matter, started, to, condense, within, cold, dark, matter, halos, these, primordial, structures, allowed, gasses, to, condense, in, to, protogalaxies, large, scale, gas, clouds, that, were, precursors, to, the, first, galaxies, 6, as, gas, falls, in, to, the, gravity, of, the, dark, matter, halos, its, pressure, and, temperature, rise, to, condense, further, the, gas, must, radiate, energy, this, process, was, slow, in, the, early, universe, dominated, by, hydrogen, atoms, and, molecules, which, are, inefficient, radiators, compared, to, heavier, elements, as, clumps, of, gas, aggregate, forming, rotating, disks, temperatures, and, pressures, continue, to, increase, some, places, within, the, disk, reach, high, enough, density, to, form, stars, once, protogalaxies, began, to, form, and, contract, the, first, halo, stars, called, population, iii, stars, appeared, within, them, these, were, composed, of, primordial, gas, almost, entirely, of, hydrogen, and, helium, emission, from, the, first, stars, heats, the, remaining, gas, helping, to, trigger, additional, star, formation, the, ultraviolet, light, emission, from, the, first, generation, of, stars, re, ionized, the, surrounding, neutral, hydrogen, in, expanding, spheres, eventually, reaching, the, entire, universe, an, event, called, reionization, the, most, massive, stars, collapse, in, violent, supernova, explosions, releasing, heavy, elements, metals, into, the, interstellar, medium, 14, this, metal, content, is, incorporated, into, population, ii, stars, theoretical, models, for, early, galaxy, formation, have, been, verified, and, informed, by, a, large, number, and, variety, of, sophisticated, astronomical, observations, 43, the, photometric, observations, generally, need, spectroscopic, confirmation, due, the, large, number, mechanisms, that, can, introduce, systematic, errors, for, example, a, high, redshift, z, 16, photometric, observation, by, james, webb, space,

radiation, and, in, some, cases, explode, the, process, of, galaxy, formation, becomes, very, complex, involving, interactions, between, the, forces, of, gravity, radiation, and, thermal, energy, many, details, are, still, poorly, understood, within, a, billion, years, of, a, galaxy, s, formation, key, structures, begin, to, appear, globular, clusters, the, central, supermassive, black, hole, and, a, galactic, bulge, of, metal, poor, population, ii, stars, form, the, creation, of, a, supermassive, black, hole, appears, to, play, a, key, role, in, actively, regulating, the, growth, of, galaxies, by, limiting, the, total, amount, of, additional, matter, added, during, this, early, epoch, galaxies, undergo, a, major, burst, of, star, formation, during, the, following, two, billion, years, the, accumulated, matter, settles, into, a, galactic, disc, a, galaxy, will, continue, to, absorb, infalling, material, from, high, velocity, clouds, and, dwarf, galaxies, throughout, its, life, this, matter, is, mostly, hydrogen, and, helium, the, cycle, of, stellar, birth, and, death, slowly, increases, the, abundance, of, heavy, elements, eventually, allowing, the, formation, of, planets, star, formation, rates, in, galaxies, depend, upon, their, local, environment, isolated, void, galaxies, have, highest, rate, per, stellar, mass, with, field, galaxies, associated, with, spiral, galaxies, having, lower, rates, and, galaxies, in, dense, cluster, having, the, lowest, rates, the, evolution, of, galaxies, can, be, significantly, affected, by, interactions, and, collisions, mergers, of, galaxies, were, common, during, the, early, epoch, and, the, majority, of, galaxies, were, peculiar, in, morphology, given, the, distances, between, the, stars, the, great, majority, of, stellar, systems, in, colliding, galaxies, will, be, unaffected, however, gravitational, stripping, of, the, interstellar, gas, and, dust, that, makes, up, the, spiral, arms, produces, a, long, train, of, stars, known, as, tidal, tails, examples, of, these, formations, can, be, seen, in, ngc, 4676, or, the, antennae, galaxies, the, milky, way, galaxy, and, the, nearby, andromeda, galaxy, are, moving, toward, each, other, at, about, 130, km, s, and, depending, upon, the, lateral, movements, the, two, might, collide, in, about, five, to, six, billion, years, although, the, milky, way, has, never, collided, with, a, galaxy, as, large, as, andromeda, before, it, has, collided, and, merged, with, other, galaxies, in, the, past, cosmological, simulations, indicate, that, 11, billion, years, ago, it, merged, with, a, particularly, large, galaxy, that, has, been, labeled, the, kraken, such, large, scale, interactions, are, rare, as, time, passes, mergers, of, two, systems, of, equal, size, become, less, common, most, bright, galaxies, have, remained, fundamentally, unchanged, for, the, last, few, billion, years, and, the, net, rate, of, star, formation, probably, also, peaked, about, ten, billion, years, ago, spiral, galaxies, like, the, milky, way, produce, new, generations, of, stars, as, long, as, they, have, dense, molecular, clouds, of, interstellar, hydrogen, in, their, spiral, arms, elliptical, galaxies, are, largely, devoid, of, this, gas, and, so, form, few, new, stars, the, supply, of, star, forming, material, is, finite, once, stars, have, converted, the, available, supply, of, hydrogen, into, heavier, elements, new, star, formation, will, come, to, an, end, the, current, era, of, star, formation, is, expected, to, continue, for, up, to, one, hundred, billion, years, and, then, the, stellar, age, will, wind, down, after, about, ten, trillion, to, one, hundred, trillion, years, 10, 13, 10, 14, years, as, the, smallest, longest, lived, stars, in, the, visible, universe, tiny, red, dwarfs, begin, to, fade, at, the, end, of, the, stellar, age, galaxies, will, be, composed, of, compact, objects, brown, dwarfs, white, dwarfs, that, are, cooling, or, cold, black, dwarfs, neutron, stars, and, black, holes, eventually, as, a, result, of, gravitational, relaxation, all, stars, will, either, fall, into, central, supermassive, black, holes, or, be, flung, into, intergalactic, space, as, a, result, of, collisions
