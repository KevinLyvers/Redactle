a, tsunami, t, s, u, n, m, i, t, s, t, soo, nah, mee, t, suu, from, japanese, lit, harbour, wave, pronounced, is, a, series, of, waves, in, a, water, body, caused, by, the, displacement, of, a, large, volume, of, water, generally, in, an, ocean, or, a, large, lake, earthquakes, volcanic, eruptions, and, underwater, explosions, including, detonations, landslides, glacier, calvings, meteorite, impacts, and, other, disturbances, above, or, below, water, all, have, the, potential, to, generate, a, tsunami, unlike, normal, ocean, waves, which, are, generated, by, wind, or, tides, which, are, in, turn, generated, by, the, gravitational, pull, of, the, moon, and, the, sun, a, tsunami, is, generated, by, the, displacement, of, water, from, a, large, event, tsunami, waves, do, not, resemble, normal, undersea, currents, or, sea, waves, because, their, wavelength, is, far, longer, rather, than, appearing, as, a, breaking, wave, a, tsunami, may, instead, initially, resemble, a, rapidly, rising, tide, for, this, reason, it, is, often, referred, to, as, a, tidal, wave, although, this, usage, is, not, favoured, by, the, scientific, community, because, it, might, give, the, false, impression, of, a, causal, relationship, between, tides, and, tsunamis, tsunamis, generally, consist, of, a, series, of, waves, with, periods, ranging, from, minutes, to, hours, arriving, in, a, so, called, wave, train, wave, heights, of, tens, of, metres, can, be, generated, by, large, events, although, the, impact, of, tsunamis, is, limited, to, coastal, areas, their, destructive, power, can, be, enormous, and, they, can, affect, entire, ocean, basins, the, 2004, indian, ocean, tsunami, was, among, the, deadliest, natural, disasters, in, human, history, with, at, least, 230, 000, people, killed, or, missing, in, 14, countries, bordering, the, indian, ocean, the, ancient, greek, historian, thucydides, suggested, in, his, 5th, century, bc, history, of, the, peloponnesian, war, that, tsunamis, were, related, to, submarine, earthquakes, but, the, understanding, of, tsunamis, remained, slim, until, the, 20th, century, and, much, remains, unknown, major, areas, of, current, research, include, determining, why, some, large, earthquakes, do, not, generate, tsunamis, while, other, smaller, ones, do, this, ongoing, research, is, designed, to, help, accurately, forecast, the, passage, of, tsunamis, across, oceans, as, well, as, how, tsunami, waves, interact, with, shorelines, the, term, tsunami, is, a, borrowing, from, the, japanese, tsunami, meaning, harbour, wave, for, the, plural, one, can, either, follow, ordinary, english, practice, and, add, an, s, or, use, an, invariable, plural, as, in, the, japanese, some, english, speakers, alter, the, word, s, initial, ts, to, an, s, by, dropping, the, t, since, english, does, not, natively, permit, ts, at, the, beginning, of, words, though, the, original, japanese, pronunciation, is, ts, the, term, has, become, commonly, accepted, in, english, although, its, literal, japanese, meaning, is, not, necessarily, descriptive, of, the, waves, which, do, not, occur, only, in, harbours, tsunamis, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, tidal, waves, this, once, popular, term, derives, from, the, most, common, appearance, of, a, tsunami, which, is, that, of, an, extraordinarily, high, tidal, bore, tsunamis, and, tides, both, produce, waves, of, water, that, move, inland, but, in, the, case, of, a, tsunami, the, inland, movement, of, water, may, be, much, greater, giving, the, impression, of, an, incredibly, high, and, forceful, tide, in, recent, years, the, term, tidal, wave, has, fallen, out, of, favour, especially, in, the, scientific, community, because, the, causes, of, tsunamis, have, nothing, to, do, with, those, of, tides, which, are, produced, by, the, gravitational, pull, of, the, moon, and, sun, rather, than, the, displacement, of, water, although, the, meanings, of, tidal, include, resembling, or, having, the, form, or, character, of, tides, use, of, the, term, tidal, wave, is, discouraged, by, geologists, and, oceanographers, a, 1969, episode, of, the, tv, crime, show, hawaii, five, o, entitled, forty, feet, high, and, it, kills, used, the, terms, tsunami, and, tidal, wave, interchangeably, the, term, seismic, sea, wave, is, also, used, to, refer, to, the, phenomenon, because, the, waves, most, often, are, generated, by, seismic, activity, such, as, earthquakes, prior, to, the, rise, of, the, use, of, the, term, tsunami, in, english, scientists, generally, encouraged, the, use, of, the, term, seismic, sea, wave, rather, than, tidal, wave, however, like, tidal, wave, seismic, sea, wave, is, not, a, completely, accurate, term, as, forces, other, than, earthquakes, including, underwater, landslides, volcanic, eruptions, underwater, explosions, land, or, ice, slumping, into, the, ocean, meteorite, impacts, and, the, weather, when, the, atmospheric, pressure, changes, very, rapidly, can, generate, such, waves, by, displacing, water, the, use, of, the, term, tsunami, for, waves, created, by, landslides, entering, bodies, of, water, has, become, internationally, widespread, in, both, scientific, and, popular, literature, although, such, waves, are, distinct, in, origin, from, large, waves, generated, by, earthquakes, this, distinction, sometimes, leads, to, the, use, of, other, terms, for, landslide, generated, waves, including, landslide, triggered, tsunami, displacement, wave, non, seismic, wave, impact, wave, and, simply, giant, wave, while, japan, may, have, the, longest, recorded, history, of, tsunamis, the, sheer, destruction, caused, by, the, 2004, indian, ocean, earthquake, and, tsunami, event, mark, it, as, the, most, devastating, of, its, kind, in, modern, times, killing, around, 230, 000, people, the, sumatran, region, is, also, accustomed, to, tsunamis, with, earthquakes, of, varying, magnitudes, regularly, occurring, off, the, coast, of, the, island, tsunamis, are, an, often, underestimated, hazard, in, the, mediterranean, sea, and, parts, of, europe, of, historical, and, current, with, regard, to, risk, assumptions, importance, are, the, 1755, lisbon, earthquake, and, tsunami, which, was, caused, by, the, azores, gibraltar, transform, fault, the, 1783, calabrian, earthquakes, each, causing, several, tens, of, thousands, of, deaths, and, the, 1908, messina, earthquake, and, tsunami, the, tsunami, claimed, more, than, 123, 000, lives, in, sicily, and, calabria, and, is, among, the, deadliest, natural, disasters, in, modern, europe, the, storegga, slide, in, the, norwegian, sea, and, some, examples, of, tsunamis, affecting, the, british, isles, refer, to, landslide, and, meteotsunamis, predominantly, and, less, to, earthquake, induced, waves, as, early, as, 426, bc, the, greek, historian, thucydides, inquired, in, his, book, history, of, the, peloponnesian, war, about, the, causes, of, tsunami, and, was, the, first, to, argue, that, ocean, earthquakes, must, be, the, cause, the, oldest, human, record, of, a, tsunami, dates, back, to, 479, bc, in, the, greek, colony, of, potidaea, thought, to, be, triggered, by, an, earthquake, the, tsunami, may, have, saved, the, colony, from, an, invasion, by, the, achaemenid, empire, the, cause, in, my, opinion, of, this, phenomenon, must, be, sought, in, the, earthquake, at, the, point, where, its, shock, has, been, the, most, violent, the, sea, is, driven, back, and, suddenly, recoiling, with, redoubled, force, causes, the, inundation, without, an, earthquake, i, do, not, see, how, such, an, accident, could, happen, the, roman, historian, ammianus, marcellinus, res, gestae, 26, 10, 15, 19, described, the, typical, sequence, of, a, tsunami, including, an, incipient, earthquake, the, sudden, retreat, of, the, sea, and, a, following, gigantic, wave, after, the, 365, ad, tsunami, devastated, alexandria, the, principal, generation, mechanism, of, a, tsunami, is, the, displacement, of, a, substantial, volume, of, water, or, perturbation, of, the, sea, this, displacement, of, water, is, usually, caused, by, earthquakes, but, can, also, be, attributed, to, landslides, volcanic, eruptions, glacier, calvings, or, more, rarely, by, meteorites, and, nuclear, tests, however, the, possibility, of, a, meteorite, causing, a, tsunami, is, debated, tsunamis, can, be, generated, when, the, sea, floor, abruptly, deforms, and, vertically, displaces, the, overlying, water, tectonic, earthquakes, are, a, particular, kind, of, earthquake, that, are, associated, with, the, earth, s, crustal, deformation, when, these, earthquakes, occur, beneath, the, sea, the, water, above, the, deformed, area, is, displaced, from, its, equilibrium, position, more, specifically, a, tsunami, can, be, generated, when, thrust, faults, associated, with, convergent, or, destructive, plate, boundaries, move, abruptly, resulting, in, water, displacement, owing, to, the, vertical, component, of, movement, involved, movement, on, normal, extensional, faults, can, also, cause, displacement, of, the, seabed, but, only, the, largest, of, such, events, typically, related, to, flexure, in, the, outer, trench, swell, cause, enough, displacement, to, give, rise, to, a, significant, tsunami, such, as, the, 1977, sumba, and, 1933, sanriku, events, tsunamis, have, a, small, wave, height, offshore, and, a, very, long, wavelength, often, hundreds, of, kilometres, long, whereas, normal, ocean, waves, have, a, wavelength, of, only, 30, or, 40, metres, which, is, why, they, generally, pass, unnoticed, at, sea, forming, only, a, slight, swell, usually, about, 300, millimetres, 12, in, above, the, normal, sea, surface, they, grow, in, height, when, they, reach, shallower, water, in, a, wave, shoaling, process, described, below, a, tsunami, can, occur, in, any, tidal, state, and, even, at, low, tide, can, still, inundate, coastal, areas, on, april, 1, 1946, the, 8, 6, m, w, aleutian, islands, earthquake, occurred, with, a, maximum, mercalli, intensity, of, vi, strong, it, generated, a, tsunami, which, inundated, hilo, on, the, island, of, hawaii, with, a, 14, metre, high, 46, ft, surge, between, 165, and, 173, were, killed, the, area, where, the, earthquake, occurred, is, where, the, pacific, ocean, floor, is, subducting, or, being, pushed, downwards, under, alaska, examples, of, tsunamis, originating, at, locations, away, from, convergent, boundaries, include, storegga, about, 8, 000, years, ago, grand, banks, in, 1929, and, papua, new, guinea, in, 1998, tappin, 2001, the, grand, banks, and, papua, new, guinea, tsunamis, came, from, earthquakes, which, destabilised, sediments, causing, them, to, flow, into, the, ocean, and, generate, a, tsunami, they, dissipated, before, travelling, transoceanic, distances, the, cause, of, the, storegga, sediment, failure, is, unknown, possibilities, include, an, overloading, of, the, sediments, an, earthquake, or, a, release, of, gas, hydrates, methane, etc, the, 1960, valdivia, earthquake, m, w, 9, 5, 1964, alaska, earthquake, m, w, 9, 2, 2004, indian, ocean, earthquake, m, w, 9, 2, and, 2011, t, hoku, earthquake, m, w, 9, 0, are, recent, examples, of, powerful, megathrust, earthquakes, that, generated, tsunamis, known, as, teletsunamis, that, can, cross, entire, oceans, smaller, m, w, 4, 2, earthquakes, in, japan, can, trigger, tsunamis, called, local, and, regional, tsunamis, that, can, devastate, stretches, of, coastline, but, can, do, so, in, only, a, few, minutes, at, a, time, the, tauredunum, event, was, a, large, tsunami, on, lake, geneva, in, 563, ce, caused, by, sedimentary, deposits, destabilised, by, a, landslide, in, the, 1950s, it, was, discovered, that, tsunamis, larger, than, had, previously, been, believed, possible, can, be, caused, by, giant, submarine, landslides, these, large, volumes, of, rapidly, displaced, water, transfer, energy, at, a, faster, rate, than, the, water, can, absorb, their, existence, was, confirmed, in, 1958, when, a, giant, landslide, in, lituya, bay, alaska, caused, the, highest, wave, ever, recorded, which, had, a, height, of, 524, metres, 1, 719, ft, the, wave, did, not, travel, far, as, it, struck, land, almost, immediately, the, wave, struck, three, boats, each, with, two, people, aboard, anchored, in, the, bay, one, boat, rode, out, the, wave, but, the, wave, sank, the, other, two, killing, both, people, aboard, one, of, them, another, landslide, tsunami, event, occurred, in, 1963, when, a, massive, landslide, from, monte, toc, entered, the, reservoir, behind, the, vajont, dam, in, italy, the, resulting, wave, surged, over, the, 262, metre, 860, ft, high, dam, by, 250, metres, 820, ft, and, destroyed, several, towns, around, 2, 000, people, died, scientists, named, these, waves, megatsunamis, some, geologists, claim, that, large, landslides, from, volcanic, islands, e, g, cumbre, vieja, on, la, palma, cumbre, vieja, tsunami, hazard, in, the, canary, islands, may, be, able, to, generate, megatsunamis, that, can, cross, oceans, but, this, is, disputed, by, many, others, in, general, landslides, generate, displacements, mainly, in, the, shallower, parts, of, the, coastline, and, there, is, conjecture, about, the, nature, of, large, landslides, that, enter, the, water, this, has, been, shown, to, subsequently, affect, water, in, enclosed, bays, and, lakes, but, a, landslide, large, enough, to, cause, a, transoceanic, tsunami, has, not, occurred, within, recorded, history, susceptible, locations, are, believed, to, be, the, big, island, of, hawaii, fogo, in, the, cape, verde, islands, la, reunion, in, the, indian, ocean, and, cumbre, vieja, on, the, island, of, la, palma, in, the, canary, islands, along, with, other, volcanic, ocean, islands, this, is, because, large, masses, of, relatively, unconsolidated, volcanic, material, occurs, on, the, flanks, and, in, some, cases, detachment, planes, are, believed, to, be, developing, however, there, is, growing, controversy, about, how, dangerous, these, slopes, actually, are, other, than, by, landslides, or, sector, collapse, volcanoes, may, be, able, to, generate, waves, by, pyroclastic, flow, submergence, caldera, collapse, or, underwater, explosions, tsunamis, have, been, triggered, by, a, number, of, volcanic, eruptions, including, the, 1883, eruption, of, krakatoa, and, the, 2022, hunga, tonga, hunga, ha, apai, eruption, over, 20, of, all, fatalities, caused, by, volcanism, during, the, past, 250, years, are, estimated, to, have, been, caused, by, volcanogenic, tsunamis, debate, has, persisted, over, the, origins, and, source, mechanisms, of, these, types, of, tsunamis, such, as, those, generated, by, krakatoa, in, 1883, and, they, remain, lesser, understood, than, their, seismic, relatives, this, poses, a, large, problem, of, awareness, and, preparedness, as, exemplified, by, the, eruption, and, collapse, of, anak, krakatoa, in, 2018, which, killed, 426, and, injured, thousands, when, no, warning, was, available, it, is, still, regarded, that, lateral, landslides, and, ocean, entering, pyroclastic, currents, are, most, likely, to, generate, the, largest, and, most, hazardous, waves, from, volcanism, however, field, investigation, of, the, tongan, event, as, well, as, developments, in, numerical, modelling, methods, currently, aim, to, expand, the, understanding, of, the, other, source, mechanisms, some, meteorological, conditions, especially, rapid, changes, in, barometric, pressure, as, seen, with, the, passing, of, a, front, can, displace, bodies, of, water, enough, to, cause, trains, of, waves, with, wavelengths, these, are, comparable, to, seismic, tsunamis, but, usually, with, lower, energies, essentially, they, are, dynamically, equivalent, to, seismic, tsunamis, the, only, differences, being, 1, that, meteotsunamis, lack, the, transoceanic, reach, of, significant, seismic, tsunamis, and, 2, that, the, force, that, displaces, the, water, is, sustained, over, some, length, of, time, such, that, meteotsunamis, cannot, be, modelled, as, having, been, caused, instantaneously, in, spite, of, their, lower, energies, on, shorelines, where, they, can, be, amplified, by, resonance, they, are, sometimes, powerful, enough, to, cause, localised, damage, and, potential, for, loss, of, life, they, have, been, documented, in, many, places, including, the, great, lakes, the, aegean, sea, the, english, channel, and, the, balearic, islands, where, they, are, common, enough, to, have, a, local, name, rissaga, in, sicily, they, are, called, marubbio, and, in, nagasaki, bay, they, are, called, abiki, some, examples, of, destructive, meteotsunamis, include, 31, march, 1979, at, nagasaki, and, 15, june, 2006, at, menorca, the, latter, causing, damage, in, the, tens, of, millions, of, euros, meteotsunamis, should, not, be, confused, with, storm, surges, which, are, local, increases, in, sea, level, associated, with, the, low, barometric, pressure, of, passing, tropical, cyclones, nor, should, they, be, confused, with, setup, the, temporary, local, raising, of, sea, level, caused, by, strong, on, shore, winds, storm, surges, and, setup, are, also, dangerous, causes, of, coastal, flooding, in, severe, weather, but, their, dynamics, are, completely, unrelated, to, tsunami, waves, they, are, unable, to, propagate, beyond, their, sources, as, waves, do, the, accidental, halifax, explosion, in, 1917, triggered, an, 18, metre, high, tsunami, in, the, harbour, there, have, been, studies, of, the, potential, of, the, induction, of, and, at, least, one, actual, attempt, to, create, tsunami, waves, as, a, tectonic, weapon, in, world, war, ii, the, new, zealand, military, forces, initiated, project, seal, which, attempted, to, create, small, tsunamis, with, explosives, in, the, area, of, today, s, shakespear, regional, park, the, attempt, failed, there, has, been, considerable, speculation, on, the, possibility, of, using, nuclear, weapons, to, cause, tsunamis, near, an, enemy, coastline, even, during, world, war, ii, consideration, of, the, idea, using, conventional, explosives, was, explored, nuclear, testing, in, the, pacific, proving, ground, by, the, united, states, seemed, to, generate, poor, results, operation, crossroads, fired, two, 20, kilotonnes, of, tnt, 84, tj, bombs, one, in, the, air, and, one, underwater, above, and, below, the, shallow, 50, m, 160, ft, waters, of, the, bikini, atoll, lagoon, fired, about, 6, km, 3, 7, mi, from, the, nearest, island, the, waves, there, were, no, higher, than, 3, 4, m, 9, 8, 13, 1, ft, upon, reaching, the, shoreline, other, underwater, tests, mainly, hardtack, i, wahoo, deep, water, and, hardtack, i, umbrella, shallow, water, confirmed, the, results, analysis, of, the, effects, of, shallow, and, deep, underwater, explosions, indicate, that, the, energy, of, the, explosions, does, not, easily, generate, the, kind, of, deep, all, ocean, waveforms, which, are, tsunamis, most, of, the, energy, creates, steam, causes, vertical, fountains, above, the, water, and, creates, compressional, waveforms, tsunamis, are, hallmarked, by, permanent, large, vertical, displacements, of, very, large, volumes, of, water, which, do, not, occur, in, explosions, tsunamis, are, caused, by, earthquakes, landslides, volcanic, explosions, glacier, calvings, and, bolides, they, cause, damage, by, two, mechanisms, the, smashing, force, of, a, wall, of, water, travelling, at, high, speed, and, the, destructive, power, of, a, large, volume, of, water, draining, off, the, land, and, carrying, a, large, amount, of, debris, with, it, even, with, waves, that, do, not, appear, to, be, large, while, everyday, wind, waves, have, a, wavelength, from, crest, to, crest, of, about, 100, metres, 330, ft, and, a, height, of, roughly, 2, metres, 6, 6, ft, a, tsunami, in, the, deep, ocean, has, a, much, larger, wavelength, of, up, to, 200, kilometres, 120, mi, such, a, wave, travels, at, well, over, 800, kilometres, per, hour, 500, mph, but, owing, to, the, enormous, wavelength, the, wave, oscillation, at, any, given, point, takes, 20, or, 30, minutes, to, complete, a, cycle, and, has, an, amplitude, of, only, about, 1, metre, 3, 3, ft, this, makes, tsunamis, difficult, to, detect, over, deep, water, where, ships, are, unable, to, feel, their, passage, the, velocity, of, a, tsunami, can, be, calculated, by, obtaining, the, square, root, of, the, depth, of, the, water, in, metres, multiplied, by, the, acceleration, due, to, gravity, approximated, to, 10, m, s, 2, for, example, if, the, pacific, ocean, is, considered, to, have, a, depth, of, 5000, metres, the, velocity, of, a, tsunami, would, be, 5000, 10, 50000, 224, metres, per, second, 730, ft, s, which, equates, to, a, speed, of, about, 806, kilometres, per, hour, 501, mph, this, is, the, formula, used, for, calculating, the, velocity, of, shallow, water, waves, even, the, deep, ocean, is, shallow, in, this, sense, because, a, tsunami, wave, is, so, long, horizontally, from, crest, to, crest, by, comparison, the, reason, for, the, japanese, name, harbour, wave, is, that, sometimes, a, village, s, fishermen, would, sail, out, and, encounter, no, unusual, waves, while, out, at, sea, fishing, and, come, back, to, land, to, find, their, village, devastated, by, a, huge, wave, as, the, tsunami, approaches, the, coast, and, the, waters, become, shallow, wave, shoaling, compresses, the, wave, and, its, speed, decreases, below, 80, kilometres, per, hour, 50, mph, its, wavelength, diminishes, to, less, than, 20, kilometres, 12, mi, and, its, amplitude, grows, enormously, in, accord, with, green, s, law, since, the, wave, still, has, the, same, very, long, period, the, tsunami, may, take, minutes, to, reach, full, height, except, for, the, very, largest, tsunamis, the, approaching, wave, does, not, break, but, rather, appears, like, a, fast, moving, tidal, bore, open, bays, and, coastlines, adjacent, to, very, deep, water, may, shape, the, tsunami, further, into, a, step, like, wave, with, a, steep, breaking, front, when, the, tsunami, s, wave, peak, reaches, the, shore, the, resulting, temporary, rise, in, sea, level, is, termed, run, up, run, up, is, measured, in, metres, above, a, reference, sea, level, a, large, tsunami, may, feature, multiple, waves, arriving, over, a, period, of, hours, with, significant, time, between, the, wave, crests, the, first, wave, to, reach, the, shore, may, not, have, the, highest, run, up, about, 80, of, tsunamis, occur, in, the, pacific, ocean, but, they, are, possible, wherever, there, are, large, bodies, of, water, including, lakes, however, tsunami, interactions, with, shorelines, and, the, seafloor, topography, are, extremely, complex, which, leaves, some, countries, more, vulnerable, than, others, for, example, the, pacific, coasts, of, the, united, states, and, mexico, lie, adjacent, to, each, other, but, the, united, states, has, recorded, ten, tsunamis, in, the, region, since, 1788, while, mexico, has, recorded, twenty, five, since, 1732, similarly, japan, has, had, more, than, a, hundred, tsunamis, in, recorded, history, while, the, neighbouring, island, of, taiwan, has, registered, only, two, in, 1781, and, 1867, all, waves, have, a, positive, and, negative, peak, that, is, a, ridge, and, a, trough, in, the, case, of, a, propagating, wave, like, a, tsunami, either, may, be, the, first, to, arrive, if, the, first, part, to, arrive, at, the, shore, is, the, ridge, a, massive, breaking, wave, or, sudden, flooding, will, be, the, first, effect, noticed, on, land, however, if, the, first, part, to, arrive, is, a, trough, a, drawback, will, occur, as, the, shoreline, recedes, dramatically, exposing, normally, submerged, areas, the, drawback, can, exceed, hundreds, of, metres, and, people, unaware, of, the, danger, sometimes, remain, near, the, shore, to, satisfy, their, curiosity, or, to, collect, fish, from, the, exposed, seabed, a, typical, wave, period, for, a, damaging, tsunami, is, about, twelve, minutes, thus, the, sea, recedes, in, the, drawback, phase, with, areas, well, below, sea, level, exposed, after, three, minutes, for, the, next, six, minutes, the, wave, trough, builds, into, a, ridge, which, may, flood, the, coast, and, destruction, ensues, during, the, next, six, minutes, the, wave, changes, from, a, ridge, to, a, trough, and, the, flood, waters, recede, in, a, second, drawback, victims, and, debris, may, be, swept, into, the, ocean, the, process, repeats, with, succeeding, waves, as, with, earthquakes, several, attempts, have, been, made, to, set, up, scales, of, tsunami, intensity, or, magnitude, to, allow, comparison, between, different, events, the, first, scales, used, routinely, to, measure, the, intensity, of, tsunamis, were, the, sieberg, ambraseys, scale, 1962, used, in, the, mediterranean, sea, and, the, imamura, iida, intensity, scale, 1963, used, in, the, pacific, ocean, the, latter, scale, was, modified, by, soloviev, 1972, who, calculated, the, tsunami, intensity, i, according, to, the, formula, where, h, a, v, displaystyle, mathit, h, av, is, the, tsunami, height, in, metres, averaged, along, the, nearest, coastline, with, the, tsunami, height, defined, as, the, rise, of, the, water, level, above, the, normal, tidal, level, at, the, time, of, occurrence, of, the, tsunami, this, scale, known, as, the, soloviev, imamura, tsunami, intensity, scale, is, used, in, the, global, tsunami, catalogues, compiled, by, the, ngdc, noaa, and, the, novosibirsk, tsunami, laboratory, as, the, main, parameter, for, the, size, of, the, tsunami, this, formula, yields, in, 2013, following, the, intensively, studied, tsunamis, in, 2004, and, 2011, a, new, 12, point, scale, was, proposed, the, integrated, tsunami, intensity, scale, itis, 2012, intended, to, match, as, closely, as, possible, to, the, modified, esi2007, and, ems, earthquake, intensity, scales, the, first, scale, that, genuinely, calculated, a, magnitude, for, a, tsunami, rather, than, an, intensity, at, a, particular, location, was, the, ml, scale, proposed, by, murty, loomis, based, on, the, potential, energy, difficulties, in, calculating, the, potential, energy, of, the, tsunami, mean, that, this, scale, is, rarely, used, abe, introduced, the, tsunami, magnitude, scale, m, t, displaystyle, mathit, m, t, calculated, from, where, h, is, the, maximum, tsunami, wave, amplitude, in, m, measured, by, a, tide, gauge, at, a, distance, r, from, the, epicentre, a, b, and, d, are, constants, used, to, make, the, m, t, scale, match, as, closely, as, possible, with, the, moment, magnitude, scale, several, terms, are, used, to, describe, the, different, characteristics, of, tsunami, in, terms, of, their, height, drawbacks, can, serve, as, a, brief, warning, people, who, observe, drawback, many, survivors, report, an, accompanying, sucking, sound, can, survive, only, if, they, immediately, run, for, high, ground, or, seek, the, upper, floors, of, nearby, buildings, in, 2004, ten, year, old, tilly, smith, of, surrey, england, was, on, maikhao, beach, in, phuket, thailand, with, her, parents, and, sister, and, having, learned, about, tsunamis, recently, in, school, told, her, family, that, a, tsunami, might, be, imminent, her, parents, warned, others, minutes, before, the, wave, arrived, saving, dozens, of, lives, she, credited, her, geography, teacher, andrew, kearney, in, the, 2004, indian, ocean, tsunami, drawback, was, not, reported, on, the, african, coast, or, any, other, east, facing, coasts, that, it, reached, this, was, because, the, initial, wave, moved, downwards, on, the, eastern, side, of, the, megathrust, and, upwards, on, the, western, side, the, western, pulse, hit, coastal, africa, and, other, western, areas, a, tsunami, cannot, be, precisely, predicted, even, if, the, magnitude, and, location, of, an, earthquake, is, known, geologists, oceanographers, and, seismologists, analyse, each, earthquake, and, based, on, many, factors, may, or, may, not, issue, a, tsunami, warning, however, there, are, some, warning, signs, of, an, impending, tsunami, and, automated, systems, can, provide, warnings, immediately, after, an, earthquake, in, time, to, save, lives, one, of, the, most, successful, systems, uses, bottom, pressure, sensors, attached, to, buoys, which, constantly, monitor, the, pressure, of, the, overlying, water, column, regions, with, a, high, tsunami, risk, typically, use, tsunami, warning, systems, to, warn, the, population, before, the, wave, reaches, land, on, the, west, coast, of, the, united, states, which, is, prone, to, tsunamis, from, the, pacific, ocean, warning, signs, indicate, evacuation, routes, in, japan, the, populace, is, well, educated, about, earthquakes, and, tsunamis, and, along, japanese, shorelines, tsunami, warning, signs, remind, people, of, the, natural, hazards, along, with, a, network, of, warning, sirens, typically, at, the, top, of, the, cliffs, of, surrounding, hills, the, pacific, tsunami, warning, system, is, based, in, honolulu, hawai, i, it, monitors, pacific, ocean, seismic, activity, a, sufficiently, large, earthquake, magnitude, and, other, information, triggers, a, tsunami, warning, while, the, subduction, zones, around, the, pacific, are, seismically, active, not, all, earthquakes, generate, a, tsunami, computers, assist, in, analysing, the, tsunami, risk, of, every, earthquake, that, occurs, in, the, pacific, ocean, and, the, adjoining, land, masses, as, a, direct, result, of, the, indian, ocean, tsunami, a, re, appraisal, of, the, tsunami, threat, for, all, coastal, areas, is, being, undertaken, by, national, governments, and, the, united, nations, disaster, mitigation, committee, a, tsunami, warning, system, is, being, installed, in, the, indian, ocean, computer, models, can, predict, tsunami, arrival, usually, within, minutes, of, the, arrival, time, bottom, pressure, sensors, can, relay, information, in, real, time, based, on, these, pressure, readings, and, other, seismic, information, and, the, seafloor, s, shape, bathymetry, and, coastal, topography, the, models, estimate, the, amplitude, and, surge, height, of, the, approaching, tsunami, all, pacific, rim, countries, collaborate, in, the, tsunami, warning, system, and, most, regularly, practise, evacuation, and, other, procedures, in, japan, such, preparation, is, mandatory, for, government, local, authorities, emergency, services, and, the, population, along, the, united, states, west, coast, in, addition, to, sirens, warnings, are, sent, on, television, and, radio, via, the, national, weather, service, using, the, emergency, alert, system, some, zoologists, hypothesise, that, some, animal, species, have, an, ability, to, sense, subsonic, rayleigh, waves, from, an, earthquake, or, a, tsunami, if, correct, monitoring, their, behaviour, could, provide, advance, warning, of, earthquakes, and, tsunamis, however, the, evidence, is, controversial, and, is, not, widely, accepted, there, are, unsubstantiated, claims, about, the, lisbon, quake, that, some, animals, escaped, to, higher, ground, while, many, other, animals, in, the, same, areas, drowned, the, phenomenon, was, also, noted, by, media, sources, in, sri, lanka, in, the, 2004, indian, ocean, earthquake, it, is, possible, that, certain, animals, e, g, elephants, may, have, heard, the, sounds, of, the, tsunami, as, it, approached, the, coast, the, elephants, reaction, was, to, move, away, from, the, approaching, noise, by, contrast, some, humans, went, to, the, shore, to, investigate, and, many, drowned, as, a, result, in, some, tsunami, prone, countries, earthquake, engineering, measures, have, been, taken, to, reduce, the, damage, caused, onshore, japan, where, tsunami, science, and, response, measures, first, began, following, a, disaster, in, 1896, has, produced, ever, more, elaborate, countermeasures, and, response, plans, the, country, has, built, many, tsunami, walls, of, up, to, 12, metres, 39, ft, high, to, protect, populated, coastal, areas, other, localities, have, built, floodgates, of, up, to, 15, 5, metres, 51, ft, high, and, channels, to, redirect, the, water, from, an, incoming, tsunami, however, their, effectiveness, has, been, questioned, as, tsunamis, often, overtop, the, barriers, the, fukushima, daiichi, nuclear, disaster, was, directly, triggered, by, the, 2011, t, hoku, earthquake, and, tsunami, when, waves, exceeded, the, height, of, the, plant, s, sea, wall, iwate, prefecture, which, is, an, area, at, high, risk, from, tsunami, had, tsunami, barriers, walls, taro, sea, wall, totalling, 25, kilometres, 16, mi, long, at, coastal, towns, the, 2011, tsunami, toppled, more, than, 50, of, the, walls, and, caused, catastrophic, damage, the, okushiri, hokkaid, tsunami, which, struck, within, two, to, five, minutes, of, the, earthquake, on, july, 12, 1993, created, waves, 30, metres, 100, ft, tall, as, high, as, a, 10, storey, building, the, port, town, of, aonae, was, completely, surrounded, by, a, tsunami, wall, but, the, waves, washed, right, over, the, wall, and, destroyed, all, the, wood, framed, structures, in, the, area, the, wall, may, have, succeeded, in, slowing, down, and, moderating, the, height, of, the, tsunami, but, it, did, not, prevent, major, destruction, and, loss, of, life
