in, organic, chemistry, an, amide, also, known, as, an, organic, amide, or, a, carboxamide, is, a, compound, with, the, general, formula, r, c, o, nr, r, where, r, r, and, r, represent, any, group, typically, organyl, groups, or, hydrogen, atoms, the, amide, group, is, called, a, peptide, bond, when, it, is, part, of, the, main, chain, of, a, protein, and, an, isopeptide, bond, when, it, occurs, in, a, side, chain, as, in, asparagine, and, glutamine, it, can, be, viewed, as, a, derivative, of, a, carboxylic, acid, r, c, o, oh, with, the, hydroxyl, group, oh, replaced, by, an, amine, group, nr, r, or, equivalently, an, acyl, alkanoyl, group, r, c, o, joined, to, an, amine, group, common, of, amides, are, formamide, h, c, o, nh, 2, acetamide, h, 3, c, c, o, nh, 2, benzamide, c, 6, h, 5, c, o, nh, 2, and, dimethylformamide, h, c, o, n, ch, 3, 2, some, uncommon, examples, of, amides, are, n, chloroacetamide, h, 3, c, c, o, nh, cl, and, chloroformamide, cl, c, o, nh, 2, amides, are, qualified, as, primary, secondary, and, tertiary, according, to, whether, the, amine, subgroup, has, the, form, nh, 2, nhr, or, nrr, where, r, and, r, are, groups, other, than, hydrogen, the, core, c, o, n, of, amides, is, called, the, amide, group, specifically, carboxamide, group, in, the, usual, nomenclature, one, adds, the, term, amide, to, the, stem, of, the, parent, acid, s, name, for, instance, the, amide, derived, from, acetic, acid, is, named, acetamide, ch, 3, conh, 2, iupac, recommends, ethanamide, but, this, and, related, formal, names, are, rarely, encountered, when, the, amide, is, derived, from, a, primary, or, secondary, amine, the, substituents, on, nitrogen, are, indicated, first, in, the, name, thus, the, amide, formed, from, dimethylamine, and, acetic, acid, is, n, n, dimethylacetamide, ch, 3, conme, 2, where, me, ch, 3, usually, even, this, name, is, simplified, to, dimethylacetamide, cyclic, amides, are, called, lactams, they, are, necessarily, secondary, or, tertiary, amides, amides, are, pervasive, in, nature, and, technology, proteins, and, important, plastics, like, nylons, aramids, twaron, and, kevlar, are, polymers, whose, units, are, connected, by, amide, groups, polyamides, these, linkages, are, easily, formed, confer, structural, rigidity, and, resist, hydrolysis, amides, include, many, other, important, biological, compounds, as, well, as, many, drugs, like, paracetamol, penicillin, and, lsd, low, molecular, weight, amides, such, as, dimethylformamide, are, common, solvents, the, lone, pair, of, electrons, on, the, nitrogen, atom, is, delocalized, into, the, carbonyl, group, thus, forming, a, partial, double, bond, between, nitrogen, and, carbon, in, fact, the, o, c, and, n, atoms, have, molecular, orbitals, occupied, by, delocalized, electrons, forming, a, conjugated, system, consequently, the, three, bonds, of, the, nitrogen, in, amides, is, not, pyramidal, as, in, the, amines, but, planar, this, planar, restriction, prevents, rotations, about, the, n, linkage, and, thus, has, important, consequences, for, the, mechanical, properties, of, bulk, material, of, such, molecules, and, also, for, the, configurational, properties, of, macromolecules, built, by, such, bonds, the, inability, to, rotate, distinguishes, amide, groups, from, ester, groups, which, allow, rotation, and, thus, create, more, flexible, bulk, material, the, c, c, o, nr, 2, core, of, amides, is, planar, the, c, o, distance, is, shorter, than, the, c, n, distance, by, almost, 10, the, structure, of, an, amide, can, be, described, also, as, a, resonance, between, two, alternative, structures, neutral, a, and, zwitterionic, b, it, is, estimated, that, for, acetamide, structure, a, makes, a, 62, contribution, to, the, structure, while, structure, b, makes, a, 28, contribution, these, figures, do, not, sum, to, 100, because, there, are, additional, less, important, resonance, forms, that, are, not, depicted, above, there, is, also, a, hydrogen, bond, present, between, the, hydrogen, and, nitrogen, atoms, in, the, active, groups, resonance, is, largely, prevented, in, the, very, strained, quinuclidone, in, their, ir, spectra, amides, exhibit, a, moderately, intense, co, band, near, 1650, cm, 1, the, energy, of, this, band, is, about, 60, cm, 1, lower, than, for, the, co, of, esters, and, ketones, this, difference, reflects, the, contribution, of, the, zwitterionic, resonance, structure, compared, to, amines, amides, are, very, weak, bases, while, the, conjugate, acid, of, an, amine, has, a, p, k, a, of, about, 9, 5, the, conjugate, acid, of, an, amide, has, a, p, k, a, around, 0, 5, therefore, compared, to, amines, amides, do, not, have, acid, base, properties, that, are, as, noticeable, in, water, this, relative, lack, of, basicity, is, explained, by, the, withdrawing, of, electrons, from, the, amine, by, the, carbonyl, on, the, other, hand, amides, are, much, stronger, bases, than, carboxylic, acids, esters, aldehydes, and, ketones, their, conjugate, acids, p, k, a, s, are, between, 6, and, 10, the, proton, of, a, primary, or, secondary, amide, does, not, dissociate, readily, its, p, k, a, is, usually, well, above, 15, conversely, under, extremely, acidic, conditions, the, carbonyl, oxygen, can, become, protonated, with, a, p, k, a, of, roughly, 1, it, is, not, only, because, of, the, positive, charge, on, the, nitrogen, but, also, because, of, the, negative, charge, on, the, oxygen, gained, through, resonance, because, of, the, greater, electronegativity, of, oxygen, than, nitrogen, the, carbonyl, c, o, is, a, stronger, dipole, than, the, n, c, dipole, the, presence, of, a, c, o, dipole, and, to, a, lesser, extent, a, n, c, dipole, allows, amides, to, act, as, h, bond, acceptors, in, primary, and, secondary, amides, the, presence, of, n, h, dipoles, allows, amides, to, function, as, h, bond, donors, as, well, thus, amides, can, participate, in, hydrogen, bonding, with, water, and, other, protic, solvents, the, oxygen, atom, can, accept, hydrogen, bonds, from, water, and, the, n, h, hydrogen, atoms, can, donate, h, bonds, as, a, result, of, interactions, such, as, these, the, water, solubility, of, amides, is, greater, than, that, of, corresponding, hydrocarbons, these, hydrogen, bonds, also, have, an, important, role, in, the, secondary, structure, of, proteins, the, solubilities, of, amides, and, esters, are, roughly, comparable, typically, amides, are, less, soluble, than, comparable, amines, and, carboxylic, acids, since, these, compounds, can, both, donate, and, accept, hydrogen, bonds, tertiary, amides, with, the, important, exception, of, n, n, dimethylformamide, exhibit, low, solubility, in, water, amides, do, not, readily, participate, in, nucleophilic, substitution, reactions, amides, are, stable, to, water, and, are, roughly, 100, times, more, stable, towards, hydrolysis, than, esters, amides, can, however, be, hydrolyzed, to, carboxylic, acids, in, the, presence, of, acid, or, base, the, stability, of, amide, bonds, has, biological, implications, since, the, amino, acids, that, make, up, proteins, are, linked, with, amide, bonds, amide, bonds, are, resistant, enough, to, hydrolysis, to, maintain, protein, structure, in, aqueous, environments, but, are, susceptible, to, catalyzed, hydrolysis, primary, and, secondary, amides, do, not, react, usefully, with, carbon, nucleophiles, instead, grignard, reagents, and, organolithiums, deprotonate, an, amide, n, h, bond, tertiary, amides, do, not, experience, this, problem, and, react, with, carbon, nucleophiles, to, give, ketones, the, amide, anion, nr, 2, is, a, very, strong, base, and, thus, a, very, poor, leaving, group, so, nucleophilic, attack, only, occurs, once, when, reacted, with, carbon, nucleophiles, n, n, dimethylformamide, dmf, can, be, used, to, introduce, a, formyl, group, here, phenyllithium, 1, attacks, the, carbonyl, group, of, dmf, 2, giving, tetrahedral, intermediate, 3, because, the, dimethylamide, anion, is, a, poor, leaving, group, the, intermediate, does, not, collapse, and, another, nucleophilic, addition, does, not, occur, upon, acidic, workup, the, alkoxide, is, protonated, to, give, 4, then, the, amine, is, protonated, to, give, 5, elimination, of, a, neutral, molecule, of, dimethylamine, and, loss, of, a, proton, give, benzaldehyde, 6, amides, hydrolyse, in, hot, alkali, as, well, as, in, strong, acidic, conditions, acidic, conditions, yield, the, carboxylic, acid, and, the, ammonium, ion, while, basic, hydrolysis, yield, the, carboxylate, ion, and, ammonia, the, protonation, of, the, initially, generated, amine, under, acidic, conditions, and, the, deprotonation, of, the, initially, generated, carboxylic, acid, under, basic, conditions, render, these, processes, non, catalytic, and, irreversible, electrophiles, other, than, protons, react, with, the, carbonyl, oxygen, this, step, often, precedes, hydrolysis, which, is, catalyzed, by, both, br, nsted, acids, and, lewis, acids, peptidase, enzymes, and, some, synthetic, catalysts, often, operate, by, attachment, of, electrophiles, to, the, carbonyl, oxygen, amides, are, usually, prepared, by, coupling, a, carboxylic, acid, with, an, amine, the, direct, reaction, generally, requires, high, temperatures, to, drive, off, the, water, esters, are, far, superior, substrates, relative, to, carboxylic, acids, further, activating, both, acid, chlorides, schotten, baumann, reaction, and, anhydrides, lumi, re, barbier, method, react, with, amines, to, give, amides, peptide, synthesis, use, coupling, agents, such, as, hatu, hobt, or, pybop, the, hydrolysis, of, nitriles, is, conducted, on, an, industrial, scale, to, produce, fatty, amides, laboratory, procedures, are, also, available, many, specialized, methods, also, yield, amides, a, variety, of, reagents, e, g, tris, 2, 2, 2, trifluoroethyl, borate, have, been, developed, for, specialized, applications
