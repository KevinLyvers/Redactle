the, internal, structure, of, earth, are, the, layers, of, the, earth, excluding, its, atmosphere, and, hydrosphere, the, structure, consists, of, an, outer, silicate, solid, crust, a, highly, viscous, asthenosphere, and, solid, mantle, a, liquid, outer, core, whose, flow, generates, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, and, a, solid, inner, core, scientific, understanding, of, the, internal, structure, of, earth, is, based, on, observations, of, topography, and, bathymetry, observations, of, rock, in, outcrop, samples, brought, to, the, surface, from, greater, depths, by, volcanoes, or, volcanic, activity, analysis, of, the, seismic, waves, that, pass, through, earth, measurements, of, the, gravitational, and, magnetic, fields, of, earth, and, experiments, with, crystalline, solids, at, pressures, and, temperatures, characteristic, of, earth, s, deep, interior, note, in, chondrite, model, 1, the, light, element, in, the, core, is, assumed, to, be, si, chondrite, model, 2, is, a, model, of, chemical, composition, of, the, mantle, corresponding, to, the, model, of, core, shown, in, chondrite, model, 1, measurements, of, the, force, exerted, by, earth, s, gravity, can, be, used, to, calculate, its, mass, astronomers, can, also, calculate, earth, s, mass, by, observing, the, motion, of, orbiting, satellites, earth, s, average, density, can, be, determined, through, gravimetric, experiments, which, have, historically, involved, pendulums, the, mass, of, earth, is, about, 6, 10, 24, kg, the, average, density, of, earth, is, 5, 515, g, cm, 3, the, structure, of, earth, can, be, defined, in, two, ways, by, mechanical, properties, such, as, rheology, or, chemically, mechanically, it, can, be, divided, into, lithosphere, asthenosphere, mesospheric, mantle, outer, core, and, the, inner, core, chemically, earth, can, be, divided, into, the, crust, upper, mantle, lower, mantle, outer, core, and, inner, core, the, geologic, component, layers, of, earth, are, at, increasing, depths, below, the, surface, 146, earth, s, crust, ranges, from, 5, 70, kilometres, 3, 1, 43, 5, mi, in, depth, and, is, the, outermost, layer, the, thin, parts, are, the, oceanic, crust, which, underlie, the, ocean, basins, 5, 10, km, and, is, mafic, rich, dense, iron, magnesium, silicate, mineral, or, igneous, rock, the, thicker, crust, is, the, continental, crust, which, is, less, dense, and, is, felsic, rich, igneous, rocks, rich, in, elements, that, form, feldspar, and, quartz, the, rocks, of, the, crust, fall, into, two, major, categories, sial, aluminium, silicate, and, sima, magnesium, silicate, it, is, estimated, that, sima, starts, about, 11, km, below, the, conrad, discontinuity, though, the, discontinuity, is, not, distinct, and, can, be, absent, in, some, continental, regions, earth, s, lithosphere, consists, of, the, crust, and, the, uppermost, mantle, the, crust, mantle, boundary, occurs, as, two, physically, different, phenomena, the, mohorovi, i, discontinuity, is, a, distinct, change, of, seismic, wave, velocity, this, is, caused, by, a, change, in, the, rock, s, density, immediately, above, the, moho, the, velocities, of, primary, seismic, waves, p, wave, are, consistent, with, those, through, basalt, 6, 7, 7, 2, km, s, and, below, they, are, similar, to, those, through, peridotite, or, dunite, 7, 6, 8, 6, km, s, second, in, oceanic, crust, there, is, a, chemical, discontinuity, between, ultramafic, cumulates, and, tectonized, harzburgites, which, has, been, observed, from, deep, parts, of, the, oceanic, crust, that, have, been, obducted, onto, the, continental, crust, and, preserved, as, ophiolite, sequences, many, rocks, making, up, earth, s, crust, formed, less, than, 100, million, years, ago, however, the, oldest, known, mineral, grains, are, about, 4, 4, billion, years, old, indicating, that, earth, has, had, a, solid, crust, for, at, least, 4, 4, billion, years, earth, s, mantle, extends, to, a, depth, of, 2, 890, km, 1, 800, mi, making, it, the, planet, s, thickest, layer, this, is, 45, of, the, 6, 371, km, 3, 959, mi, radius, and, 83, 7, of, the, volume, 0, 6, of, the, volume, is, the, crust, the, mantle, is, divided, into, upper, and, lower, mantle, separated, by, a, transition, zone, the, lowest, part, of, the, mantle, next, to, the, core, mantle, boundary, is, known, as, the, d, d, double, prime, layer, the, pressure, at, the, bottom, of, the, mantle, is, 140, g, pa, 1, 4, m, atm, the, mantle, is, composed, of, silicate, rocks, richer, in, iron, and, magnesium, than, the, overlying, crust, although, solid, the, mantle, s, extremely, hot, silicate, material, can, flow, over, very, long, timescales, convection, of, the, mantle, propels, the, motion, of, the, tectonic, plates, in, the, crust, the, source, of, heat, that, drives, this, motion, is, the, decay, of, radioactive, isotopes, in, earth, s, crust, and, mantle, combined, with, the, initial, heat, from, the, planet, s, formation, from, the, potential, energy, released, by, collapsing, a, large, amount, of, matter, into, a, gravity, well, and, the, kinetic, energy, of, accreted, matter, due, to, increasing, pressure, deeper, in, the, mantle, the, lower, part, flows, less, easily, though, chemical, changes, within, the, mantle, may, also, be, important, the, viscosity, of, the, mantle, ranges, between, 10, 21, and, 10, 24, pascal, second, increasing, with, depth, in, comparison, the, viscosity, of, water, at, 300, k, 27, c, 80, f, is, 0, 89, millipascal, second, and, pitch, is, 2, 3, 0, 5, 10, 8, pascal, second, earth, s, outer, core, is, a, fluid, layer, about, 2, 260, km, 1, 400, mi, in, height, i, e, distance, from, the, highest, point, to, the, lowest, point, at, the, edge, of, the, inner, core, and, composed, of, mostly, iron, and, nickel, that, lies, above, earth, s, solid, inner, core, and, below, its, mantle, its, outer, boundary, lies, 2, 890, km, 1, 800, mi, beneath, earth, s, surface, the, transition, between, the, inner, core, and, outer, core, is, located, approximately, 5, 150, km, 3, 200, mi, beneath, earth, s, surface, earth, s, inner, core, is, the, innermost, geologic, layer, of, the, planet, earth, it, is, primarily, a, solid, ball, with, a, radius, of, about, 1, 220, km, 760, mi, which, is, about, 19, of, earth, s, radius, or, 70, of, the, moon, s, radius, the, inner, core, was, discovered, in, 1936, by, inge, lehmann, and, is, generally, composed, primarily, of, iron, and, some, nickel, since, this, layer, is, able, to, transmit, shear, waves, transverse, seismic, waves, it, must, be, solid, experimental, evidence, has, at, times, been, inconsistent, with, current, crystal, models, of, the, core, other, experimental, studies, show, a, discrepancy, under, high, pressure, diamond, anvil, static, studies, at, core, pressures, yield, melting, temperatures, that, are, approximately, 2000, k, below, those, from, shock, laser, dynamic, studies, the, laser, studies, create, plasma, and, the, results, are, suggestive, that, constraining, inner, core, conditions, will, depend, on, whether, the, inner, core, is, a, solid, or, is, a, plasma, with, the, density, of, a, solid, this, is, an, area, of, active, research, in, early, stages, of, earth, s, formation, about, 4, 6, billion, years, ago, melting, would, have, caused, denser, substances, to, sink, toward, the, center, in, a, process, called, planetary, differentiation, see, also, the, iron, catastrophe, while, less, dense, materials, would, have, migrated, to, the, crust, the, core, is, thus, believed, to, largely, be, composed, of, iron, 80, along, with, nickel, and, one, or, more, light, elements, whereas, other, dense, elements, such, as, lead, and, uranium, either, are, too, rare, to, be, significant, or, tend, to, bind, to, lighter, elements, and, thus, remain, in, the, crust, see, felsic, materials, some, have, argued, that, the, inner, core, may, be, in, the, form, of, a, single, iron, crystal, under, laboratory, conditions, a, sample, of, iron, nickel, alloy, was, subjected, to, the, core, like, pressure, by, gripping, it, in, a, vise, between, 2, diamond, tips, diamond, anvil, cell, and, then, heating, to, approximately, 4000, k, the, sample, was, observed, with, x, rays, and, strongly, supported, the, theory, that, earth, s, inner, core, was, made, of, giant, crystals, running, north, to, south, the, composition, of, earth, bears, strong, similarities, to, that, of, certain, chondrite, meteorites, and, even, to, some, elements, in, the, outer, portion, of, the, sun, beginning, as, early, as, 1940, scientists, including, francis, birch, built, geophysics, upon, the, premise, that, earth, is, like, ordinary, chondrites, the, most, common, type, of, meteorite, observed, impacting, earth, this, ignores, the, less, abundant, enstatite, chondrites, which, formed, under, extremely, limited, available, oxygen, leading, to, certain, normally, oxyphile, elements, existing, either, partially, or, wholly, in, the, alloy, portion, that, corresponds, to, the, core, of, earth, dynamo, theory, suggests, that, convection, in, the, outer, core, combined, with, the, coriolis, effect, gives, rise, to, earth, s, magnetic, field, the, solid, inner, core, is, too, hot, to, hold, a, permanent, magnetic, field, see, curie, temperature, but, probably, acts, to, stabilize, the, magnetic, field, generated, by, the, liquid, outer, core, the, average, magnetic, field, in, earth, s, outer, core, is, estimated, to, measure, 2, 5, milliteslas, 25, gauss, 50, times, stronger, than, the, magnetic, field, at, the, surface, the, magnetic, field, generated, by, core, flow, is, essential, to, protect, life, from, interplanetary, radiation, and, prevent, the, atmosphere, from, dissipating, in, the, solar, wind, the, rate, of, cooling, by, conduction, and, convection, is, uncertain, but, one, estimate, is, that, the, core, would, not, be, expected, to, freeze, up, for, approximately, 91, billion, years, which, is, well, after, the, sun, is, expected, to, expand, sterilize, the, surface, of, the, planet, and, then, burn, out, the, layering, of, earth, has, been, inferred, indirectly, using, the, time, of, travel, of, refracted, and, reflected, seismic, waves, created, by, earthquakes, the, core, does, not, allow, shear, waves, to, pass, through, it, while, the, speed, of, travel, seismic, velocity, is, different, in, other, layers, the, changes, in, seismic, velocity, between, different, layers, causes, refraction, owing, to, snell, s, law, like, light, bending, as, it, passes, through, a, prism, likewise, reflections, are, caused, by, a, large, increase, in, seismic, velocity, and, are, similar, to, light, reflecting, from, a, mirror
