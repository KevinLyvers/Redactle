the, field, of, strength, of, materials, also, called, mechanics, of, materials, typically, refers, to, various, methods, of, calculating, the, stresses, and, strains, in, structural, members, such, as, beams, columns, and, shafts, the, methods, employed, to, predict, the, response, of, a, structure, under, loading, and, its, susceptibility, to, various, failure, modes, takes, into, account, the, properties, of, the, materials, such, as, its, yield, strength, ultimate, strength, young, s, modulus, and, poisson, s, ratio, in, addition, the, mechanical, element, s, macroscopic, properties, geometric, properties, such, as, its, length, width, thickness, boundary, constraints, and, abrupt, changes, in, geometry, such, as, holes, are, considered, the, theory, began, with, the, consideration, of, the, behavior, of, one, and, two, dimensional, members, of, structures, whose, states, of, stress, can, be, approximated, as, two, dimensional, and, was, then, generalized, to, three, dimensions, to, develop, a, more, complete, theory, of, the, elastic, and, plastic, behavior, of, materials, an, important, founding, pioneer, in, mechanics, of, materials, was, stephen, timoshenko, in, the, mechanics, of, materials, the, strength, of, a, material, is, its, ability, to, withstand, an, applied, load, without, failure, or, plastic, deformation, the, field, of, strength, of, materials, deals, with, forces, and, deformations, that, result, from, their, acting, on, a, material, a, load, applied, to, a, mechanical, member, will, induce, internal, forces, within, the, member, called, stresses, when, those, forces, are, expressed, on, a, unit, basis, the, stresses, acting, on, the, material, cause, deformation, of, the, material, in, various, manners, including, breaking, them, completely, deformation, of, the, material, is, called, strain, when, those, deformations, too, are, placed, on, a, unit, basis, the, stresses, and, strains, that, develop, within, a, mechanical, member, must, be, calculated, in, order, to, assess, the, load, capacity, of, that, member, this, requires, a, complete, description, of, the, geometry, of, the, member, its, constraints, the, loads, applied, to, the, member, and, the, properties, of, the, material, of, which, the, member, is, composed, the, applied, loads, may, be, axial, tensile, or, compressive, or, rotational, strength, shear, with, a, complete, description, of, the, loading, and, the, geometry, of, the, member, the, state, of, stress, and, state, of, strain, at, any, point, within, the, member, can, be, calculated, once, the, state, of, stress, and, strain, within, the, member, is, known, the, strength, load, carrying, capacity, of, that, member, its, deformations, stiffness, qualities, and, its, stability, ability, to, maintain, its, original, configuration, can, be, calculated, the, calculated, stresses, may, then, be, compared, to, some, measure, of, the, strength, of, the, member, such, as, its, material, yield, or, ultimate, strength, the, calculated, deflection, of, the, member, may, be, compared, to, deflection, criteria, that, are, based, on, the, member, s, use, the, calculated, buckling, load, of, the, member, may, be, compared, to, the, applied, load, the, calculated, stiffness, and, mass, distribution, of, the, member, may, be, used, to, calculate, the, member, s, dynamic, response, and, then, compared, to, the, acoustic, environment, in, which, it, will, be, used, material, strength, refers, to, the, point, on, the, engineering, stress, strain, curve, yield, stress, beyond, which, the, material, experiences, deformations, that, will, not, be, completely, reversed, upon, removal, of, the, loading, and, as, a, result, the, member, will, have, a, permanent, deflection, the, ultimate, strength, of, the, material, refers, to, the, maximum, value, of, stress, reached, the, fracture, strength, is, the, stress, value, at, fracture, the, last, stress, value, recorded, uniaxial, stress, is, expressed, by, where, p, is, the, force, acting, on, an, area, a, the, area, can, be, the, undeformed, area, or, the, deformed, area, depending, on, whether, engineering, stress, or, true, stress, is, of, interest, material, resistance, can, be, expressed, in, several, mechanical, stress, parameters, the, term, material, strength, is, used, when, referring, to, mechanical, stress, parameters, these, are, physical, quantities, with, dimension, homogeneous, to, pressure, and, force, per, unit, surface, the, traditional, measure, unit, for, strength, are, therefore, mpa, in, the, international, system, of, units, and, the, psi, between, the, united, states, customary, units, strength, parameters, include, yield, strength, tensile, strength, fatigue, strength, crack, resistance, and, other, parameters, the, slope, of, this, line, is, known, as, young, s, modulus, or, the, modulus, of, elasticity, the, modulus, of, elasticity, can, be, used, to, determine, the, stress, strain, relationship, in, the, linear, elastic, portion, of, the, stress, strain, curve, the, linear, elastic, region, is, either, below, the, yield, point, or, if, a, yield, point, is, not, easily, identified, on, the, stress, strain, plot, it, is, defined, to, be, between, 0, and, 0, 2, strain, and, is, defined, as, the, region, of, strain, in, which, no, yielding, permanent, deformation, occurs, consider, the, difference, between, a, carrot, and, chewed, bubble, gum, the, carrot, will, stretch, very, little, before, breaking, the, chewed, bubble, gum, on, the, other, hand, will, plastically, deform, enormously, before, finally, breaking, ultimate, strength, is, an, attribute, related, to, a, material, rather, than, just, a, specific, specimen, made, of, the, material, and, as, such, it, is, quoted, as, the, force, per, unit, of, cross, section, area, n, m, 2, the, ultimate, strength, is, the, maximum, stress, that, a, material, can, withstand, before, it, breaks, or, weakens, for, example, the, ultimate, tensile, strength, uts, of, aisi, 1018, steel, is, 440, mpa, in, imperial, units, the, unit, of, stress, is, given, as, lbf, in, 2, or, pounds, force, per, square, inch, this, unit, is, often, abbreviated, as, psi, one, thousand, psi, is, abbreviated, ksi, a, factor, of, safety, is, a, design, criteria, that, an, engineered, component, or, structure, must, achieve, f, s, f, f, displaystyle, fs, f, f, where, fs, the, factor, of, safety, rf, the, applied, stress, and, f, ultimate, allowable, stress, psi, or, mpa, margin, of, safety, is, the, common, method, for, design, criteria, it, is, defined, ms, p, u, p, 1, for, example, to, achieve, a, factor, of, safety, of, 4, the, allowable, stress, in, an, aisi, 1018, steel, component, can, be, calculated, to, be, f, u, t, s, f, s, displaystyle, f, uts, fs, 440, 4, 110, mpa, or, f, displaystyle, f, 110, 10, 6, n, m, 2, such, allowable, stresses, are, also, known, as, design, stresses, or, working, stresses, design, stresses, that, have, been, determined, from, the, ultimate, or, yield, point, values, of, the, materials, give, safe, and, reliable, results, only, for, the, case, of, static, loading, many, machine, parts, fail, when, subjected, to, a, non, steady, and, continuously, varying, loads, even, though, the, developed, stresses, are, below, the, yield, point, such, failures, are, called, fatigue, failure, the, failure, is, by, a, fracture, that, appears, to, be, brittle, with, little, or, no, visible, evidence, of, yielding, however, when, the, stress, is, kept, below, fatigue, stress, or, endurance, limit, stress, the, part, will, endure, indefinitely, a, purely, reversing, or, cyclic, stress, is, one, that, alternates, between, equal, positive, and, negative, peak, stresses, during, each, cycle, of, operation, in, a, purely, cyclic, stress, the, average, stress, is, zero, when, a, part, is, subjected, to, a, cyclic, stress, also, known, as, stress, range, sr, it, has, been, observed, that, the, failure, of, the, part, occurs, after, a, number, of, stress, reversals, n, even, if, the, magnitude, of, the, stress, range, is, below, the, material, s, yield, strength, generally, higher, the, range, stress, the, fewer, the, number, of, reversals, needed, for, failure, there, are, four, failure, theories, maximum, shear, stress, theory, maximum, normal, stress, theory, maximum, strain, energy, theory, and, maximum, distortion, energy, theory, von, mises, criterion, of, failre, out, of, these, four, theories, of, failure, the, maximum, normal, stress, theory, is, only, applicable, for, brittle, materials, and, the, remaining, three, theories, are, applicable, for, ductile, materials, of, the, latter, three, the, distortion, energy, theory, provides, the, most, accurate, results, in, a, majority, of, the, stress, conditions, the, strain, energy, theory, needs, the, value, of, poisson, s, ratio, of, the, part, material, which, is, often, not, readily, available, the, maximum, shear, stress, theory, is, conservative, for, simple, unidirectional, normal, stresses, all, theories, are, equivalent, which, means, all, theories, will, give, the, same, result, a, material, s, strength, is, dependent, on, its, microstructure, the, engineering, processes, to, which, a, material, is, subjected, can, alter, this, microstructure, the, variety, of, strengthening, mechanisms, that, alter, the, strength, of, a, material, includes, work, hardening, solid, solution, strengthening, precipitation, hardening, and, grain, boundary, strengthening, and, can, be, quantitatively, and, qualitatively, explained, strengthening, mechanisms, are, accompanied, by, the, caveat, that, some, other, mechanical, properties, of, the, material, may, degenerate, in, an, attempt, to, make, the, material, stronger, for, example, in, grain, boundary, strengthening, although, yield, strength, is, maximized, with, decreasing, grain, size, ultimately, very, small, grain, sizes, make, the, material, brittle, in, general, the, yield, strength, of, a, material, is, an, adequate, indicator, of, the, material, s, mechanical, strength, considered, in, tandem, with, the, fact, that, the, yield, strength, is, the, parameter, that, predicts, plastic, deformation, in, the, material, one, can, make, informed, decisions, on, how, to, increase, the, strength, of, a, material, depending, on, its, microstructural, properties, and, the, desired, end, effect, strength, is, expressed, in, terms, of, the, limiting, values, of, the, compressive, stress, tensile, stress, and, shear, stresses, that, would, cause, failure, the, effects, of, dynamic, loading, are, probably, the, most, important, practical, consideration, of, the, theory, of, elasticity, especially, the, problem, of, fatigue, repeated, loading, often, initiates, cracks, which, grow, until, failure, occurs, at, the, corresponding, residual, strength, of, the, structure, cracks, always, start, at, a, stress, concentrations, especially, changes, in, cross, section, of, the, product, or, defects, in, manufacturing, near, holes, and, corners, at, nominal, stress, levels, far, lower, than, those, quoted, for, the, strength, of, the, material
