uranium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, u, and, atomic, number, 92, it, is, a, silvery, grey, metal, in, the, actinide, series, of, the, periodic, table, a, uranium, atom, has, 92, protons, and, 92, electrons, of, which, 6, are, valence, electrons, uranium, radioactively, decays, usually, by, emitting, an, alpha, particle, the, half, life, of, this, decay, varies, between, 159, 200, and, 4, 5, billion, years, for, different, isotopes, making, them, useful, for, dating, the, age, of, the, earth, the, most, common, isotopes, in, natural, uranium, are, uranium, 238, which, has, 146, neutrons, and, accounts, for, over, 99, of, uranium, on, earth, and, uranium, 235, which, has, 143, neutrons, uranium, has, the, highest, atomic, weight, of, the, primordially, occurring, elements, its, density, is, about, 70, higher, than, that, of, lead, and, slightly, lower, than, that, of, gold, or, tungsten, it, occurs, naturally, in, low, concentrations, of, a, few, parts, per, million, in, soil, rock, and, water, and, is, commercially, extracted, from, uranium, bearing, minerals, such, as, uraninite, many, contemporary, uses, of, uranium, exploit, its, unique, nuclear, properties, uranium, 235, is, the, only, naturally, occurring, fissile, isotope, which, makes, it, widely, used, in, nuclear, power, plants, and, nuclear, weapons, however, because, of, the, low, abundance, of, uranium, 235, in, natural, uranium, which, is, overwhelmingly, mostly, uranium, 238, uranium, needs, to, undergo, enrichment, so, that, enough, uranium, 235, is, present, uranium, 238, is, fissionable, by, fast, neutrons, and, is, fertile, meaning, it, can, be, transmuted, to, fissile, plutonium, 239, in, a, nuclear, reactor, another, fissile, isotope, uranium, 233, can, be, produced, from, natural, thorium, and, is, studied, for, future, industrial, use, in, nuclear, technology, uranium, 238, has, a, small, probability, for, spontaneous, fission, or, even, induced, fission, with, fast, neutrons, uranium, 235, and, to, a, lesser, degree, uranium, 233, have, a, much, higher, fission, cross, section, for, slow, neutrons, in, sufficient, concentration, these, isotopes, maintain, a, sustained, nuclear, chain, reaction, this, generates, the, heat, in, nuclear, power, reactors, and, produces, the, fissile, material, for, nuclear, weapons, the, primary, civilian, use, for, uranium, harnesses, the, heat, energy, to, produce, electricity, depleted, uranium, 238, u, is, used, in, kinetic, energy, penetrators, and, armor, plating, the, 1789, discovery, of, uranium, in, the, mineral, pitchblende, is, credited, to, martin, heinrich, klaproth, who, named, the, new, element, after, the, recently, discovered, planet, uranus, eug, ne, melchior, p, ligot, was, the, first, person, to, isolate, the, metal, and, its, radioactive, properties, were, discovered, in, 1896, by, henri, becquerel, research, by, otto, hahn, lise, meitner, enrico, fermi, and, others, such, as, j, robert, oppenheimer, starting, in, 1934, led, to, its, use, as, a, fuel, in, the, nuclear, power, industry, and, in, little, boy, the, first, nuclear, weapon, used, in, war, an, ensuing, arms, race, during, the, cold, war, between, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, produced, tens, of, thousands, of, nuclear, weapons, that, used, uranium, metal, and, uranium, derived, plutonium, 239, dismantling, of, these, weapons, and, related, nuclear, facilities, is, carried, out, within, various, nuclear, disarmament, programs, and, costs, billions, of, dollars, weapon, grade, uranium, obtained, from, nuclear, weapons, is, diluted, with, uranium, 238, and, reused, as, fuel, for, nuclear, reactors, spent, nuclear, fuel, forms, radioactive, waste, which, mostly, consists, of, uranium, 238, and, poses, a, significant, health, threat, and, environmental, impact, uranium, is, a, silvery, white, weakly, radioactive, metal, it, has, a, mohs, hardness, of, 6, sufficient, to, scratch, glass, and, roughly, equal, to, that, of, titanium, rhodium, manganese, and, niobium, it, is, malleable, ductile, slightly, paramagnetic, strongly, electropositive, and, a, poor, electrical, conductor, uranium, metal, has, a, very, high, density, of, 19, 1, g, cm, 3, denser, than, lead, 11, 3, g, cm, 3, but, slightly, less, dense, than, tungsten, and, gold, 19, 3, g, cm, 3, uranium, metal, reacts, with, almost, all, non, metallic, elements, except, noble, gases, and, their, compounds, with, reactivity, increasing, with, temperature, hydrochloric, and, nitric, acids, dissolve, uranium, but, non, oxidizing, acids, other, than, hydrochloric, acid, attack, the, element, very, slowly, when, finely, divided, it, can, react, with, cold, water, in, air, uranium, metal, becomes, coated, with, a, dark, layer, of, uranium, oxide, uranium, in, ores, is, extracted, chemically, and, converted, into, uranium, dioxide, or, other, chemical, forms, usable, in, industry, uranium, 235, was, the, first, isotope, that, was, found, to, be, fissile, other, naturally, occurring, isotopes, are, fissionable, but, not, fissile, on, bombardment, with, slow, neutrons, uranium, 235, most, of, the, time, splits, into, two, smaller, nuclei, releasing, nuclear, binding, energy, and, more, neutrons, if, too, many, of, these, neutrons, are, absorbed, by, other, uranium, 235, nuclei, a, nuclear, chain, reaction, occurs, that, results, in, a, burst, of, heat, or, in, some, circumstances, an, explosion, in, a, nuclear, reactor, such, a, chain, reaction, is, slowed, and, controlled, by, a, neutron, poison, absorbing, some, of, the, free, neutrons, such, neutron, absorbent, materials, are, often, part, of, reactor, control, rods, see, nuclear, reactor, physics, for, a, description, of, this, process, of, reactor, control, as, little, as, 15, lb, 6, 8, kg, of, uranium, 235, can, be, used, to, make, an, atomic, bomb, the, nuclear, weapon, detonated, over, hiroshima, called, little, boy, relied, on, uranium, fission, however, the, first, nuclear, bomb, the, gadget, used, at, trinity, and, the, bomb, that, was, detonated, over, nagasaki, fat, man, were, both, plutonium, bombs, uranium, metal, has, three, allotropic, forms, the, major, application, of, uranium, in, the, military, sector, is, in, high, density, penetrators, this, ammunition, consists, of, depleted, uranium, du, alloyed, with, 1, 2, other, elements, such, as, titanium, or, molybdenum, at, high, impact, speed, the, density, hardness, and, pyrophoricity, of, the, projectile, enable, the, destruction, of, heavily, armored, targets, tank, armor, and, other, removable, vehicle, armor, can, also, be, hardened, with, depleted, uranium, plates, the, use, of, depleted, uranium, became, politically, and, environmentally, contentious, after, the, use, of, such, munitions, by, the, us, uk, and, other, countries, during, wars, in, the, persian, gulf, and, the, balkans, raised, questions, concerning, uranium, compounds, left, in, the, soil, see, gulf, war, syndrome, depleted, uranium, is, also, used, as, a, shielding, material, in, some, containers, used, to, store, and, transport, radioactive, materials, while, the, metal, itself, is, radioactive, its, high, density, makes, it, more, effective, than, lead, in, halting, radiation, from, strong, sources, such, as, radium, other, uses, of, depleted, uranium, include, counterweights, for, aircraft, control, surfaces, as, ballast, for, missile, re, entry, vehicles, and, as, a, shielding, material, due, to, its, high, density, this, material, is, found, in, inertial, guidance, systems, and, in, gyroscopic, compasses, depleted, uranium, is, preferred, over, similarly, dense, metals, due, to, its, ability, to, be, easily, machined, and, cast, as, well, as, its, relatively, low, cost, the, main, risk, of, exposure, to, depleted, uranium, is, chemical, poisoning, by, uranium, oxide, rather, than, radioactivity, uranium, being, only, a, weak, alpha, emitter, during, the, later, stages, of, world, war, ii, the, entire, cold, war, and, to, a, lesser, extent, afterwards, uranium, 235, has, been, used, as, the, fissile, explosive, material, to, produce, nuclear, weapons, initially, two, major, types, of, fission, bombs, were, built, a, relatively, simple, device, that, uses, uranium, 235, and, a, more, complicated, mechanism, that, uses, plutonium, 239, derived, from, uranium, 238, later, a, much, more, complicated, and, far, more, powerful, type, of, fission, fusion, bomb, thermonuclear, weapon, was, built, that, uses, a, plutonium, based, device, to, cause, a, mixture, of, tritium, and, deuterium, to, undergo, nuclear, fusion, such, bombs, are, jacketed, in, a, non, fissile, unenriched, uranium, case, and, they, derive, more, than, half, their, power, from, the, fission, of, this, material, by, fast, neutrons, from, the, nuclear, fusion, process, the, main, use, of, uranium, in, the, civilian, sector, is, to, fuel, nuclear, power, plants, one, kilogram, of, uranium, 235, can, theoretically, produce, about, 20, terajoules, of, energy, 2, 10, 13, joules, assuming, complete, fission, as, much, energy, as, 1, 5, million, kilograms, 1, 500, tonnes, of, coal, commercial, nuclear, power, plants, use, fuel, that, is, typically, enriched, to, around, 3, uranium, 235, the, candu, and, magnox, designs, are, the, only, commercial, reactors, capable, of, using, unenriched, uranium, fuel, fuel, used, for, united, states, navy, reactors, is, typically, highly, enriched, in, uranium, 235, the, exact, values, are, classified, in, a, breeder, reactor, uranium, 238, can, also, be, converted, into, plutonium, 239, through, the, following, reaction, before, and, occasionally, after, the, discovery, of, radioactivity, uranium, was, primarily, used, in, small, amounts, for, yellow, glass, and, pottery, glazes, such, as, uranium, glass, and, in, fiestaware, the, discovery, and, isolation, of, radium, in, uranium, ore, pitchblende, by, marie, curie, sparked, the, development, of, uranium, mining, to, extract, the, radium, which, was, used, to, make, glow, in, the, dark, paints, for, clock, and, aircraft, dials, this, left, a, prodigious, quantity, of, uranium, as, a, waste, product, since, it, takes, three, tonnes, of, uranium, to, extract, one, gram, of, radium, this, waste, product, was, diverted, to, the, glazing, industry, making, uranium, glazes, very, inexpensive, and, abundant, besides, the, pottery, glazes, uranium, tile, glazes, accounted, for, the, bulk, of, the, use, including, common, bathroom, and, kitchen, tiles, which, can, be, produced, in, green, yellow, mauve, black, blue, red, and, other, colors, uranium, was, also, used, in, photographic, chemicals, especially, uranium, nitrate, as, a, toner, in, lamp, filaments, for, stage, lighting, bulbs, to, improve, the, appearance, of, dentures, and, in, the, leather, and, wood, industries, for, stains, and, dyes, uranium, salts, are, mordants, of, silk, or, wool, uranyl, acetate, and, uranyl, formate, are, used, as, electron, dense, stains, in, transmission, electron, microscopy, to, increase, the, contrast, of, biological, specimens, in, ultrathin, sections, and, in, negative, staining, of, viruses, isolated, cell, organelles, and, macromolecules, the, discovery, of, the, radioactivity, of, uranium, ushered, in, additional, scientific, and, practical, uses, of, the, element, the, long, half, life, of, uranium, 238, 4, 47, 10, 9, years, makes, it, well, suited, for, use, in, estimating, the, age, of, the, earliest, igneous, rocks, and, for, other, types, of, radiometric, dating, including, uranium, thorium, dating, uranium, lead, dating, and, uranium, uranium, dating, uranium, metal, is, used, for, x, ray, targets, in, the, making, of, high, energy, x, rays, the, use, of, uranium, in, its, natural, oxide, form, dates, back, to, at, least, the, year, 79, ad, when, it, was, used, in, the, roman, empire, to, add, a, yellow, color, to, ceramic, glazes, yellow, glass, with, 1, uranium, oxide, was, found, in, a, roman, villa, on, cape, posillipo, in, the, bay, of, naples, italy, by, r, t, gunther, of, the, university, of, oxford, in, 1912, starting, in, the, late, middle, ages, pitchblende, was, extracted, from, the, habsburg, silver, mines, in, joachimsthal, bohemia, now, j, chymov, in, the, czech, republic, and, was, used, as, a, coloring, agent, in, the, local, glassmaking, industry, in, the, early, 19th, century, the, world, s, only, known, sources, of, uranium, ore, were, these, mines, mining, for, uranium, in, the, ore, mountains, ceased, on, the, german, side, after, the, cold, war, ended, and, sdag, wismut, was, wound, down, on, the, czech, side, there, were, attempts, during, the, uranium, price, bubble, of, 2007, to, restart, mining, but, those, were, quickly, abandoned, following, a, fall, in, uranium, prices, the, discovery, of, the, element, is, credited, to, the, german, chemist, martin, heinrich, klaproth, while, he, was, working, in, his, experimental, laboratory, in, berlin, in, 1789, klaproth, was, able, to, precipitate, a, yellow, compound, likely, sodium, diuranate, by, dissolving, pitchblende, in, nitric, acid, and, neutralizing, the, solution, with, sodium, hydroxide, klaproth, assumed, the, yellow, substance, was, the, oxide, of, a, yet, undiscovered, element, and, heated, it, with, charcoal, to, obtain, a, black, powder, which, he, thought, was, the, newly, discovered, metal, itself, in, fact, that, powder, was, an, oxide, of, uranium, he, named, the, newly, discovered, element, after, the, planet, uranus, named, after, the, primordial, greek, god, of, the, sky, which, had, been, discovered, eight, years, earlier, by, william, herschel, in, 1841, eug, ne, melchior, p, ligot, professor, of, analytical, chemistry, at, the, conservatoire, national, des, arts, et, m, tiers, central, school, of, arts, and, manufactures, in, paris, isolated, the, first, sample, of, uranium, metal, by, heating, uranium, tetrachloride, with, potassium, henri, becquerel, discovered, radioactivity, by, using, uranium, in, 1896, becquerel, made, the, discovery, in, paris, by, leaving, a, sample, of, a, uranium, salt, k, 2, uo, 2, so, 4, 2, potassium, uranyl, sulfate, on, top, of, an, unexposed, photographic, plate, in, a, drawer, and, noting, that, the, plate, had, become, fogged, he, determined, that, a, form, of, invisible, light, or, rays, emitted, by, uranium, had, exposed, the, plate, during, world, war, i, when, the, central, powers, suffered, a, shortage, of, molybdenum, to, make, artillery, gun, barrels, and, high, speed, tool, steels, they, routinely, used, ferrouranium, alloy, as, a, substitute, as, it, presents, many, of, the, same, physical, characteristics, as, molybdenum, when, this, practice, became, known, in, 1916, the, us, government, requested, several, prominent, universities, to, research, the, use, of, uranium, in, manufacturing, and, metalwork, tools, made, with, these, formulas, remained, in, use, for, several, decades, until, the, manhattan, project, and, the, cold, war, placed, a, large, demand, on, uranium, for, fission, research, and, weapon, development, a, team, led, by, enrico, fermi, in, 1934, found, that, bombarding, uranium, with, neutrons, produces, beta, rays, electrons, or, positrons, from, the, elements, produced, see, beta, particle, the, fission, products, were, at, first, mistaken, for, new, elements, with, atomic, numbers, 93, and, 94, which, the, dean, of, the, sapienza, university, of, rome, orso, mario, corbino, named, ausenium, and, hesperium, respectively, the, experiments, leading, to, the, discovery, of, uranium, s, ability, to, fission, break, apart, into, lighter, elements, and, release, binding, energy, were, conducted, by, otto, hahn, and, fritz, strassmann, in, hahn, s, laboratory, in, berlin, lise, meitner, and, her, nephew, physicist, otto, robert, frisch, published, the, physical, explanation, in, february, 1939, and, named, the, process, nuclear, fission, soon, after, fermi, hypothesized, that, fission, of, uranium, might, release, enough, neutrons, to, sustain, a, fission, reaction, confirmation, of, this, hypothesis, came, in, 1939, and, later, work, found, that, on, average, about, 2, 5, neutrons, are, released, by, each, fission, of, uranium, 235, fermi, urged, alfred, o, c, nier, to, separate, uranium, isotopes, for, determination, of, the, fissile, component, and, on, 29, february, 1940, nier, used, an, instrument, he, built, at, the, university, of, minnesota, to, separate, the, world, s, first, uranium, 235, sample, in, the, tate, laboratory, using, columbia, university, s, cyclotron, john, dunning, confirmed, the, sample, to, be, the, isolated, fissile, material, on, 1, march, further, work, found, that, the, far, more, common, uranium, 238, isotope, can, be, transmuted, into, plutonium, which, like, uranium, 235, is, also, fissile, by, thermal, neutrons, these, discoveries, led, numerous, countries, to, begin, working, on, the, development, of, nuclear, weapons, and, nuclear, power, despite, fission, having, been, discovered, in, germany, the, uranverein, uranium, club, germany, s, wartime, project, to, research, nuclear, power, and, or, weapons, was, hampered, by, limited, resources, infighting, the, exile, or, non, involvement, of, several, prominent, scientists, in, the, field, and, several, crucial, mistakes, such, as, failing, to, account, for, impurities, in, available, graphite, samples, which, made, it, appear, less, suitable, as, a, neutron, moderator, than, it, is, in, reality, germany, s, attempts, to, build, a, natural, uranium, heavy, water, reactor, had, not, come, close, to, reaching, criticality, by, the, time, the, americans, reached, haigerloch, the, site, of, the, last, german, wartime, reactor, experiment, on, 2, december, 1942, as, part, of, the, manhattan, project, another, team, led, by, enrico, fermi, was, able, to, initiate, the, first, artificial, self, sustained, nuclear, chain, reaction, chicago, pile, 1, an, initial, plan, using, enriched, uranium, 235, was, abandoned, as, it, was, as, yet, unavailable, in, sufficient, quantities, working, in, a, lab, below, the, stands, of, stagg, field, at, the, university, of, chicago, the, team, created, the, conditions, needed, for, such, a, reaction, by, piling, together, 360, tonnes, of, graphite, 53, tonnes, of, uranium, oxide, and, 5, 5, tonnes, of, uranium, metal, most, of, which, was, supplied, by, westinghouse, lamp, plant, in, a, makeshift, production, process, two, types, of, atomic, bomb, were, developed, by, the, united, states, during, world, war, ii, a, uranium, based, device, codenamed, little, boy, whose, fissile, material, was, highly, enriched, uranium, and, a, plutonium, based, device, see, trinity, test, and, fat, man, whose, plutonium, was, derived, from, uranium, 238, little, boy, became, the, first, nuclear, weapon, used, in, war, when, it, was, detonated, over, hiroshima, japan, on, 6, august, 1945, exploding, with, a, yield, equivalent, to, 12, 500, tonnes, of, tnt, the, blast, and, thermal, wave, of, the, bomb, destroyed, nearly, 50, 000, buildings, and, killed, about, 75, 000, people, see, atomic, bombings, of, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, initially, it, was, believed, that, uranium, was, relatively, rare, and, that, nuclear, proliferation, could, be, avoided, by, simply, buying, up, all, known, uranium, stocks, but, within, a, decade, large, deposits, of, it, were, discovered, in, many, places, around, the, world, the, x, 10, graphite, reactor, at, oak, ridge, national, laboratory, ornl, in, oak, ridge, tennessee, formerly, known, as, the, clinton, pile, and, x, 10, pile, was, the, world, s, second, artificial, nuclear, reactor, after, enrico, fermi, s, chicago, pile, and, was, the, first, reactor, designed, and, built, for, continuous, operation, argonne, national, laboratory, s, experimental, breeder, reactor, i, located, at, the, atomic, energy, commission, s, national, reactor, testing, station, near, arco, idaho, became, the, first, nuclear, reactor, to, create, electricity, on, 20, december, 1951, initially, four, 150, watt, light, bulbs, were, lit, by, the, reactor, but, improvements, eventually, enabled, it, to, power, the, whole, facility, later, the, town, of, arco, became, the, first, in, the, world, to, have, all, its, electricity, come, from, nuclear, power, generated, by, borax, iii, another, reactor, designed, and, operated, by, argonne, national, laboratory, the, world, s, first, commercial, scale, nuclear, power, station, obninsk, in, the, soviet, union, began, generation, with, its, reactor, am, 1, on, 27, june, 1954, other, early, nuclear, power, plants, were, calder, hall, in, england, which, began, generation, on, 17, october, 1956, and, the, shippingport, atomic, power, station, in, pennsylvania, which, began, on, 26, may, 1958, nuclear, power, was, used, for, the, first, time, for, propulsion, by, a, submarine, the, uss, nautilus, in, 1954, in, 1972, french, physicist, francis, perrin, discovered, fifteen, ancient, and, no, longer, active, natural, nuclear, fission, reactors, in, three, separate, ore, deposits, at, the, oklo, mine, in, gabon, africa, collectively, known, as, the, oklo, fossil, reactors, the, ore, deposit, is, 1, 7, billion, years, old, then, uranium, 235, constituted, about, 3, of, uranium, on, earth, this, is, high, enough, to, permit, a, sustained, chain, reaction, if, other, supporting, conditions, exist, the, capacity, of, the, surrounding, sediment, to, contain, the, health, threatening, nuclear, waste, products, has, been, cited, by, the, u, s, federal, government, as, supporting, evidence, for, the, feasibility, to, store, spent, nuclear, fuel, at, the, yucca, mountain, nuclear, waste, repository, above, ground, nuclear, tests, by, the, soviet, union, and, the, united, states, in, the, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, and, by, france, into, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, spread, a, significant, amount, of, fallout, from, uranium, daughter, isotopes, around, the, world, additional, fallout, and, pollution, occurred, from, several, nuclear, accidents, uranium, miners, have, a, higher, incidence, of, cancer, an, excess, risk, of, lung, cancer, among, navajo, uranium, miners, for, example, has, been, documented, and, linked, to, their, occupation, the, radiation, exposure, compensation, act, a, 1990, law, in, the, us, required, 100, 000, in, compassion, payments, to, uranium, miners, diagnosed, with, cancer, or, other, respiratory, ailments, during, the, cold, war, between, the, soviet, union, and, the, united, states, huge, stockpiles, of, uranium, were, amassed, and, tens, of, thousands, of, nuclear, weapons, were, created, using, enriched, uranium, and, plutonium, made, from, uranium, after, the, break, up, of, the, soviet, union, in, 1991, an, estimated, 600, short, tons, 540, metric, tons, of, highly, enriched, weapons, grade, uranium, enough, to, make, 40, 000, nuclear, warheads, had, been, stored, in, often, inadequately, guarded, facilities, in, the, russian, federation, and, several, other, former, soviet, states, police, in, asia, europe, and, south, america, on, at, least, 16, occasions, from, 1993, to, 2005, have, intercepted, shipments, of, smuggled, bomb, grade, uranium, or, plutonium, most, of, which, was, from, ex, soviet, sources, from, 1993, to, 2005, the, material, protection, control, and, accounting, program, operated, by, the, federal, government, of, the, united, states, spent, about, us, 550, million, to, help, safeguard, uranium, and, plutonium, stockpiles, in, russia, this, money, was, used, for, improvements, and, security, enhancements, at, research, and, storage, facilities, safety, of, nuclear, facilities, in, russia, has, been, significantly, improved, since, the, stabilization, of, political, and, economical, turmoil, of, the, early, 1990s, for, example, in, 1993, there, were, 29, incidents, ranking, above, level, 1, on, the, international, nuclear, event, scale, and, this, number, dropped, under, four, per, year, in, 1995, 2003, the, number, of, employees, receiving, annual, radiation, doses, above, 20, msv, which, is, equivalent, to, a, single, full, body, ct, scan, saw, a, strong, decline, around, 2000, in, november, 2015, the, russian, government, approved, a, federal, program, for, nuclear, and, radiation, safety, for, 2016, to, 2030, with, a, budget, of, 562, billion, rubles, ca, 8, billion, usd, its, key, issue, is, the, deferred, liabilities, accumulated, during, the, 70, years, of, the, nuclear, industry, particularly, during, the, time, of, the, soviet, union, about, 73, of, the, budget, will, be, spent, on, decommissioning, aged, and, obsolete, nuclear, reactors, and, nuclear, facilities, especially, those, involved, in, state, defense, programs, 20, will, go, in, processing, and, disposal, of, nuclear,

and, water, it, is, the, highest, numbered, element, found, naturally, in, significant, quantities, on, earth, and, is, almost, always, found, combined, with, other, elements, uranium, is, the, 48th, most, abundant, element, in, the, earth, s, crust, the, decay, of, uranium, thorium, and, potassium, 40, in, earth, s, mantle, is, thought, to, be, the, main, source, of, heat, that, keeps, the, earth, s, outer, core, in, the, liquid, state, and, drives, mantle, convection, which, in, turn, drives, plate, tectonics, uranium, s, concentration, in, the, earth, s, crust, is, depending, on, the, reference, 2, to, 4, parts, per, million, or, about, 40, times, as, abundant, as, silver, the, earth, s, crust, from, the, surface, to, 25, km, 15, mi, down, is, calculated, to, contain, 10, 17, kg, 2, 10, 17, lb, of, uranium, while, the, oceans, may, contain, 10, 13, kg, 2, 10, 13, lb, the, concentration, of, uranium, in, soil, ranges, from, 0, 7, to, 11, parts, per, million, up, to, 15, parts, per, million, in, farmland, soil, due, to, use, of, phosphate, fertilizers, and, its, concentration, in, sea, water, is, 3, parts, per, billion, uranium, is, more, plentiful, than, antimony, tin, cadmium, mercury, or, silver, and, it, is, about, as, abundant, as, arsenic, or, molybdenum, uranium, is, found, in, hundreds, of, minerals, including, uraninite, the, most, common, uranium, ore, carnotite, autunite, uranophane, torbernite, and, coffinite, significant, concentrations, of, uranium, occur, in, some, substances, such, as, phosphate, rock, deposits, and, minerals, such, as, lignite, and, monazite, sands, in, uranium, rich, ores, it, is, recovered, commercially, from, sources, with, as, little, as, 0, 1, uranium, like, all, elements, with, atomic, weights, higher, than, that, of, iron, uranium, is, only, naturally, formed, by, the, r, process, rapid, neutron, capture, in, supernovae, and, neutron, star, mergers, primordial, thorium, and, uranium, are, only, produced, in, the, r, process, because, the, s, process, slow, neutron, capture, is, too, slow, and, cannot, pass, the, gap, of, instability, after, bismuth, besides, the, two, extant, primordial, uranium, isotopes, 235, u, and, 238, u, the, r, process, also, produced, significant, quantities, of, 236, u, which, has, a, shorter, half, life, and, so, is, an, extinct, radionuclide, having, long, since, decayed, completely, to, 232, th, further, uranium, 236, was, produced, by, the, decay, of, 244, pu, accounting, for, the, observed, higher, than, expected, abundance, of, thorium, and, lower, than, expected, abundance, of, uranium, while, the, natural, abundance, of, uranium, has, been, supplemented, by, the, decay, of, extinct, 242, pu, half, life, 375, 000, years, and, 247, cm, half, life, 16, million, years, producing, 238, u, and, 235, u, respectively, this, occurred, to, an, almost, negligible, extent, due, to, the, shorter, half, lives, of, these, parents, and, their, lower, production, than, 236, u, and, 244, pu, the, parents, of, thorium, the, 247, cm, 235, u, ratio, at, the, formation, of, the, solar, system, was, 7, 0, 1, 6, 10, 5, some, bacteria, such, as, shewanella, putrefaciens, geobacter, metallireducens, and, some, strains, of, burkholderia, fungorum, use, uranium, for, their, growth, and, convert, u, vi, to, u, iv, recent, research, suggests, that, this, pathway, includes, reduction, of, the, soluble, u, vi, via, an, intermediate, u, v, pentavalent, state, other, organisms, such, as, the, lichen, trapelia, involuta, or, microorganisms, such, as, the,

phosphate, or, other, similar, organic, phosphates, after, one, day, one, gram, of, bacteria, can, encrust, themselves, with, nine, grams, of, uranyl, phosphate, crystals, this, creates, the, possibility, that, these, organisms, could, be, used, in, bioremediation, to, decontaminate, uranium, polluted, water, the, proteobacterium, geobacter, has, also, been, shown, to, bioremediate, uranium, in, ground, water, the, mycorrhizal, fungus, glomus, intraradices, increases, uranium, content, in, the, roots, of, its, symbiotic, plant, in, nature, uranium, vi, forms, highly, soluble, carbonate, complexes, at, alkaline, ph, this, leads, to, an, increase, in, mobility, and, availability, of, uranium, to, groundwater, and, soil, from, nuclear, wastes, which, leads, to, health, hazards, however, it, is, difficult, to, precipitate, uranium, as, phosphate, in, the, presence, of, excess, carbonate, at, alkaline, ph, a, sphingomonas, sp, strain, bsar, 1, has, been, found, to, express, a, high, activity, alkaline, phosphatase, phok, that, has, been, applied, for, bioprecipitation, of, uranium, as, uranyl, phosphate, species, from, alkaline, solutions, the, precipitation,

viable, at, us, 130, per, kg, of, uranium, while, 35, million, tonnes, are, classed, as, mineral, resources, reasonable, prospects, for, eventual, economic, extraction, australia, has, 28, of, the, world, s, known, uranium, ore, reserves, and, the, world, s, largest, single, uranium, deposit, is, located, at, the, olympic, dam, mine, in, south, australia, there, is, a, significant, reserve, of, uranium, in, bakouma, a, sub, prefecture, in, the, prefecture, of, mbomou, in, the, central, african, republic, some, uranium, also, originates, from, dismantled, nuclear, weapons, for, example, in, 1993, 2013, russia, supplied, the, united, states, with, 15, 000, tonnes, of, low, enriched, uranium, within, the, megatons, to, megawatts, program, an, additional, 4, 6, billion, tonnes, of, uranium, are, estimated, to, be, dissolved, in, sea, water, japanese, scientists, in, the, 1980s, showed, that, extraction, of, uranium, from, sea, water, using, ion, exchangers, was, technically, feasible, there, have, been, experiments, to, extract, uranium, from, sea, water, but, the, yield, has, been, low, due, to, the, carbonate, present, in, the, water, in, 2012, ornl, researchers, announced, the, successful, development, of, a, new, absorbent, material, dubbed, hicap, which, performs, surface, retention, of, solid, or, gas, molecules, atoms, or, ions, and, also, effectively, removes, toxic,

experts, estimating, the, deposits, at, over, 25, of, the, world, s, then, known, uranium, reserves, of, 800, 000, tons, the, ultimate, available, supply, is, believed, to, be, sufficient, for, at, least, the, next, 85, years, though, some, studies, indicate, underinvestment, in, the, late, twentieth, century, may, produce, supply, problems, in, the, 21st, century, uranium, deposits, seem, to, be, log, normal, distributed, there, is, a, 300, fold, increase, in, the, amount, of, uranium, recoverable, for, each, tenfold, decrease, in, ore, grade, in, other, words, there, is, little, high, grade, ore, and, proportionately, much, more, low, grade, ore, available, calcined, uranium, yellowcake, as, produced, in, many, large, mills, contains, a, distribution, of, uranium, oxidation, species, in, various, forms, ranging, from, most, oxidized, to, least, oxidized, particles, with, short, residence, times, in, a, calciner, will, generally, be, less, oxidized, than, those, with, long, retention, times, or, particles, recovered, in, the, stack, scrubber, uranium, content, is, usually, referenced, to, u, 3, o, 8, which, dates, to, the, days, of, the, manhattan, project, when, u, 3, o, 8, was, used, as, an, analytical, chemistry, reporting, standard, phase, relationships, in, the, uranium, oxygen, system, are, complex, the, most, important, oxidation, states, of, uranium, are, uranium, iv, and, uranium, vi, and, their, two, corresponding, oxides, are, respectively, uranium, dioxide, uo, 2, and, uranium, trioxide, uo, 3, other, uranium, oxides, such, as, uranium, monoxide, uo, diuranium, pentoxide, u, 2, o, 5, and, uranium, peroxide, uo, 4, 2h, 2, o, also, exist, the, most, common, forms, of, uranium, oxide, are, triuranium, octoxide, u, 3, o, 8, and, uo, 2, both, oxide, forms, are, solids, that, have, low, solubility, in, water, and, are, relatively, stable, over, a, wide, range, of, environmental, conditions, triuranium, octoxide, is, depending, on, conditions, the, most, stable, compound, of, uranium, and, is, the, form, most, commonly, found, in, nature, uranium, dioxide, is, the, form, in, which, uranium, is, most, commonly, used, as, a, nuclear, reactor, fuel, at, ambient, temperatures, uo, 2, will, gradually, convert, to, u, 3, o, 8, because, of, their, stability, uranium, oxides, are, generally, considered, the, preferred, chemical, form, for, storage, or, disposal, salts, of, many, oxidation, states, of, uranium, are, water, soluble, and, may, be, studied, in, aqueous, solutions, the, most, common, ionic, forms, are, u, 3, brown, red, u, 4, green, uo, 2, unstable, and, uo, 2, 2, yellow, for, u, iii, u, iv, u, v, and, u, vi, respectively, a, few, solid, and, semi, metallic, compounds, such, as, uo, and, us, exist, for, the, formal, oxidation, state, uranium, ii, but, no, simple, ions, are, known, to, exist, in, solution, for, that, state, ions, of, u, 3, liberate, hydrogen, from, water, and, are, therefore, considered, to, be, highly, unstable, the, uo, 2, 2, ion, represents, the, uranium, vi, state, and, is, known, to, form, compounds, such, as, uranyl, carbonate, uranyl, chloride, and, uranyl, sulfate, uo, 2, 2, also, forms, complexes, with, various, organic, chelating, agents, the, most, commonly, encountered, of, which, is, uranyl, acetate, unlike, the, uranyl, salts, of, uranium, and, polyatomic, ion, uranium, oxide, cationic, forms, the, uranates, salts, containing, a, polyatomic, uranium, oxide, anion, are, generally, not, water, soluble, the, interactions, of, carbonate, anions, with, uranium, vi, cause, the, pourbaix, diagram, to, change, greatly, when, the, medium, is, changed, from, water, to, a, carbonate, containing, solution, while, the, vast, majority, of, carbonates, are, insoluble, in, water, students, are, often, taught, that, all, carbonates, other, than, those, of, alkali, metals, are, insoluble, in, water, uranium, carbonates, are, often, soluble, in, water, this, is, because, a, u, vi, cation, is, able, to, bind, two, terminal, oxides, and, three, or, more, carbonates, to, form, anionic, complexes, the, uranium, fraction, diagrams, in, the, presence, of, carbonate, illustrate, this, further, when, the, ph, of, a, uranium, vi, solution, increases, the, uranium, is, converted, to, a, hydrated, uranium, oxide, hydroxide, and, at, high, phs, it, becomes, an, anionic, hydroxide, complex, when, carbonate, is, added, uranium, is, converted, to, a, series, of, carbonate, complexes, if, the, ph, is, increased, one, effect, of, these, reactions, is, increased, solubility, of, uranium, in, the, ph, range, 6, to, 8, a, fact, that, has, a, direct, bearing, on, the, long, term, stability, of, spent, uranium, dioxide, nuclear, fuels, uranium, metal, heated, to, 250, to, 300, c, 482, to, 572, f, reacts, with, hydrogen, to, form, uranium, hydride, even, higher, temperatures, will, reversibly, remove, the, hydrogen, this, property, makes, uranium, hydrides, convenient, starting, materials, to, create, reactive, uranium, powder, along, with, various, uranium, carbide, nitride, and, halide, compounds, two, crystal, modifications, of, uranium, hydride, exist, an, form, that, is, obtained, at, low, temperatures, and, a, form, that, is, created, when, the, formation, temperature, is, above, 250, c, uranium, carbides, and, uranium, nitrides, are, both, relatively, inert, semimetallic, compounds, that, are, minimally, soluble, in, acids, react, with, water, and, can, ignite, in, air, to, form, u, 3, o, 8, carbides, of, uranium, include, uranium, monocarbide, u, c, uranium, dicarbide, uc, 2, and, diuranium, tricarbide, u, 2, c, 3, both, uc, and, uc, 2, are, formed, by, adding, carbon, to, molten, uranium, or, by, exposing, the, metal, to, carbon, monoxide, at, high, temperatures, stable, below, 1800, c, u, 2, c, 3, is, prepared, by, subjecting, a, heated, mixture, of, uc, and, uc, 2, to, mechanical, stress, uranium, nitrides, obtained, by, direct, exposure, of, the, metal, to, nitrogen, include, uranium, mononitride, un, uranium, dinitride, un, 2, and, diuranium, trinitride, u, 2, n, 3, all, uranium, fluorides, are, created, using, uranium, tetrafluoride, uf, 4, uf, 4, itself, is, prepared, by, hydrofluorination, of, uranium, dioxide, reduction, of, uf, 4, with, hydrogen, at, 1000, c, produces, uranium, trifluoride, uf, 3, under, the, right, conditions, of, temperature, and, pressure, the, reaction, of, solid, uf, 4, with, gaseous, uranium, hexafluoride, uf, 6, can, form, the, intermediate, fluorides, of, u, 2, f, 9, u, 4, f, 17, and, uf, 5, at, room, temperatures, uf, 6, has, a, high, vapor, pressure, making, it, useful, in, the, gaseous, diffusion, process, to, separate, the, rare, uranium, 235, from, the, common, uranium, 238, isotope, this, compound, can, be, prepared, from, uranium, dioxide, and, uranium, hydride, by, the, following, process, the, resulting, uf, 6, a, white, solid, is, highly, reactive, by, fluorination, easily, sublimes, emitting, a, vapor, that, behaves, as, a, nearly, ideal, gas, and, is, the, most, volatile, compound, of, uranium, known, to, exist, one, method, of, preparing, uranium, tetrachloride, ucl, 4, is, to, directly, combine, chlorine, with, either, uranium, metal, or, uranium, hydride, the, reduction, of, ucl, 4, by, hydrogen, produces, uranium, trichloride, ucl, 3, while, the, higher, chlorides, of, uranium, are, prepared, by, reaction, with, additional, chlorine, all, uranium, chlorides, react, with, water, and, air, bromides, and, iodides, of, uranium, are, formed, by, direct, reaction, of, respectively, bromine, and, iodine, with, uranium, or, by, adding, uh, 3, to, those, element, s, acids, known, examples, include, ubr, 3, ubr, 4, ui, 3, and, ui, 4, ui, 5, has, never, been, prepared, uranium, oxyhalides, are, water, soluble, and, include, uo, 2, f, 2, uocl, 2, uo, 2, cl, 2, and, uo, 2, br, 2, stability, of, the, oxyhalides, decrease, as, the, atomic, weight, of, the, component, halide, increases, uranium, like, all, elements, with, an, atomic, number, greater, than, 82, has, no, stable, isotopes, all, isotopes, of, uranium, are, radioactive, because, the, strong, nuclear, force, does, not, prevail, over, electromagnetic, repulsion, in, nuclides, containing, more, than, 82, protons, nevertheless, the, two, most, stable, isotopes, 238, u, and, 235, u, have, half, lives, long, enough, to, occur, in, nature, as, primordial, radionuclides, with, measurable, quantities, having, survived, since, the, formation, of, the, earth, these, two, nuclides, along, with, thorium, 232, are, the, only, confirmed, primordial, nuclides, heavier, than, nearly, stable, bismuth, 209, natural, uranium, consists, of, three, major, isotopes, uranium, 238, 99, 28, natural, abundance, uranium, 235, 0, 71, and, uranium, 234, 0, 0054, there, are, also, five, other, trace, isotopes, uranium, 240, a, decay, product, of, plutonium, 244, uranium, 239, which, is, formed, when, 238, u, undergoes, spontaneous, fission, releasing, neutrons, that, are, captured, by, another, 238, u, atom, uranium, 237, which, is, formed, when, 238, u, captures, a, neutron, but, emits, two, more, which, then, decays, to, neptunium, 237, uranium, 236, which, occurs, in, trace, quantities, due, to, neutron, capture, on, 235, u, and, as, a, decay, product, of, plutonium, 244, and, finally, uranium, 233, which, is, formed, in, the, decay, chain, of, neptunium, 237, additionally, uranium, 232, would, be, produced, by, the, double, beta, decay, of, natural, thorium, 232, though, this, energetically, possible, process, has, never, been, observed, uranium, 238, is, the, most, stable, isotope, of, uranium, with, a, half, life, of, about, 4, 463, 10, 9, years, roughly, the, age, of, the, earth, uranium, 238, is, predominantly, an, alpha, emitter, decaying, to, thorium, 234, it, ultimately, decays, through, the, uranium, series, which, has, 18, members, into, lead, 206, uranium, 238, is, not, fissile, but, is, a, fertile, isotope, because, after, neutron, activation, it, can, be, converted, to, plutonium, 239, another, fissile, isotope, indeed, the, 238, u, nucleus, can, absorb, one, neutron, to, produce, the, radioactive, isotope, uranium, 239, 239, u, decays, by, beta, emission, to, neptunium, 239, also, a, beta, emitter, that, decays, in, its, turn, within, a, few, days, into, plutonium, 239, 239, pu, was, used, as, fissile, material, in, the, first, atomic, bomb, detonated, in, the, trinity, test, on, 16, july, 1945, in, new, mexico, uranium, 235, has, a, half, life, of, about, 7, 04, 10, 8, years, it, is, the, next, most, stable, uranium, isotope, after, 238, u, and, is, also, predominantly, an, alpha, emitter, decaying, to, thorium, 231, uranium, 235, is, important, for, both, nuclear, reactors, and, nuclear, weapons, because, it, is, the, only, uranium, isotope, existing, in, nature, on, earth, in, significant, amounts, that, is, fissile, this, means, that, it, can, be, split, into, two, or, three, fragments, fission, products, by, thermal, neutrons, the, decay, chain, of, 235, u, which, is, called, the, actinium, series, has, 15, members, and, eventually, decays, into, lead, 207, the, constant, rates, of, decay, in, these, decay, series, makes, the, comparison, of, the, ratios, of, parent, to, daughter, elements, useful, in, radiometric, dating, uranium, 236, has, a, half, life, of, 2, 342, 10, 7, years, and, is, not, found, in, significant, quantities, in, nature, the, half, life, of, uranium, 236, is, too, short, for, it, to, be, primordial, though, it, has, been, identified, as, an, extinct, progenitor, of, its, alpha, decay, daughter, thorium, 232, uranium, 236, occurs, in, spent, nuclear, fuel, when, neutron, capture, on, 235, u, does, not, induce, fission, or, as, a, decay, product, of, plutonium, 240, uranium, 236, is, not, fertile, as, three, more, neutron, captures, are, required, to, produce, fissile, 239, pu, and, is, not, itself, fissile, as, such, it, is, considered, long, lived, radioactive, waste, uranium, 234, is, a, member, of, the, uranium, series, and, occurs, in, equilibrium, with, its, progenitor, 238, u, it, undergoes, alpha, decay, with, a, half, life, of, 245, 500, years, and, decays, to, lead, 206, through, a, series, of, relatively, short, lived, isotopes, uranium, 233, undergoes, alpha, decay, with, a, half, life, of, 160, 000, years, and, like, 235, u, is, fissile, it, can, be, bred, from, thorium, 232, via, neutron, bombardment, usually, in, a, nuclear, reactor, this, process, is, known, as, the, thorium, fuel, cycle, owing, to, the, fissility, of, 233, u, and, the, greater, natural, abundance, of, thorium, three, times, that, of, uranium, 233, u, has, been, investigated, for, use, as, nuclear, fuel, as, a, possible, alternative, to, 235, u, and, 239, pu, though, is, not, in, widespread, use, as, of, 2022, the, decay, chain, of, uranium, 233, forms, part, of, the, neptunium, series, and, ends, at, nearly, stable, bismuth, 209, half, life, 2, 01, 10, 19, years, and, stable, thallium, 205, uranium, 232, is, an, alpha, emitter, with, a, half, life, of, 68, 9, years, this, isotope, is, produced, as, a, byproduct, in, production, of, 233, u, and, is, considered, a, nuisance, as, it, is, not, fissile, and, decays, through, short, lived, alpha, and, gamma, emitters, such, as, 208, tl, it, is, also, expected, that, thorium, 232, should, be, able, to, undergo, double, beta, decay, which, would, produce, uranium, 232, but, this, has, not, yet, been, observed, experimentally, all, isotopes, from, 232, u, to, 236, u, inclusive, have, minor, cluster, decay, branches, less, than, 10, 10, and, all, these, bar, 233, u, in, addition, to, 238, u, have, minor, spontaneous, fission, branches, the, greatest, branching, ratio, for, spontaneous, fission, is, about, 5, 10, 5, for, 238, u, or, about, one, in, every, two, million, decays, the, shorter, lived, trace, isotopes, 237, u, and, 239, u, exclusively, undergo, beta, decay, with, respective, half, lives, of, 6, 752, days, and, 23, 45, minutes, in, total, 28, isotopes, of, uranium, have, been, identified, ranging, in, mass, number, from, 214, to, 242, with, the, exception, of, 220, among, the, uranium, isotopes, not, found, in, natural, samples, or, nuclear, fuel, the, longest, lived, is, 230, u, an, alpha, emitter, with, a, half, life, of, 20, 23, days, this, isotope, has, been, considered, for, use, in, targeted, alpha, particle, therapy, tat, all, other, isotopes, have, half, lives, shorter, than, one, hour, except, for, 231, u, half, life, 4, 2, days, and, 240, u, half, life, 14, 1, hours, the, shortest, lived, known, isotope, is, 221, u, with, a, half, life, of, 660, nanoseconds, and, it, is, expected, that, the, hitherto, unknown, 220, u, has, an, even, shorter, half, life, the, proton, rich, isotopes, lighter, than, 232, u, primarily, undergo, alpha, decay, except, for, 229, u, and, 231, u, which, decay, to, protactinium, isotopes, via, positron, emission, and, electron, capture, respectively, the, neutron, rich, 240, u, 241, u, and, 242, u, undergo, beta, decay, to, form, neptunium, isotopes, in, nature, uranium, is, found, as, uranium, 238, 99, 2742, and, uranium, 235, 0, 7204, isotope, separation, concentrates, enriches, the, fissile, uranium, 235, for, nuclear, weapons, and, most, nuclear, power, plants, except, for, gas, cooled, reactors, and, pressurized, heavy, water, reactors, most, neutrons, released, by, a, fissioning, atom, of, uranium, 235, must, impact, other, uranium, 235, atoms, to, sustain, the, nuclear, chain, reaction, the, concentration, and, amount, of, uranium, 235, needed, to, achieve, this, is, called, a, critical, mass, to, be, considered, enriched, the, uranium, 235, fraction, should, be, between, 3, and, 5, this, process, produces, huge, quantities, of, uranium, that, is, depleted, of, uranium, 235, and, with, a, correspondingly, increased, fraction, of, uranium, 238, called, depleted, uranium, or, du, to, be, considered, depleted, the, 235, u, concentration, should, be, no, more, than, 0, 3, the, price, of, uranium, has, risen, since, 2001, so, enrichment, tailings, containing, more, than, 0, 35, uranium, 235, are, being, considered, for, re, enrichment, driving, the, price, of, depleted, uranium, hexafluoride, above, 130, per, kilogram, in, july, 2007, from, 5, in, 2001, the, gas, centrifuge, process, where, gaseous, uranium, hexafluoride, uf, 6, is, separated, by, the, difference, in, molecular, weight, between, 235, uf, 6, and, 238, uf, 6, using, high, speed, centrifuges, is, the, cheapest, and, leading, enrichment, process, the, gaseous, diffusion, process, had, been, the, leading, method, for, enrichment, and, was, used, in, the, manhattan, project, in, this, process, uranium, hexafluoride, is, repeatedly, diffused, through, a, silver, zinc, membrane, and, the, different, isotopes, of, uranium, are, separated, by, diffusion, rate, since, uranium, 238, is, heavier, it, diffuses, slightly, slower, than, uranium, 235, the, molecular, laser, isotope, separation, method, employs, a, laser, beam, of, precise, energy, to, sever, the, bond, between, uranium, 235, and, fluorine, this, leaves, uranium, 238, bonded, to, fluorine, and, allows, uranium, 235, metal, to, precipitate, from, the, solution, an, alternative, laser, method, of, enrichment, is, known, as, atomic, vapor, laser, isotope, separation, avlis, and, employs, visible, tunable, lasers, such, as, dye, lasers, another, method, used, is, liquid, thermal, diffusion, the, only, significant, deviation, from, the, 235, u, to, 238, u, ratio, in, any, known, natural, samples, occurs, in, oklo, gabon, where, natural, nuclear, fission, reactors, consumed, some, of, the, 235, u, some, two, billion, years, ago, when, the, ratio, of, 235, u, to, 238, u, was, more, akin, to, that, of, low, enriched, uranium, allowing, regular, light, water, to, act, as, a, neutron, moderator, akin, to, the, process, in, humanmade, light, water, reactors, the, existence, of, such, natural, fission, reactors, which, had, been, theoretically, predicted, beforehand, was, proven, as, the, slight, deviation, of, 235, u, concentration, from, the, expected, values, were, discovered, during, uranium, enrichment, in, france, subsequent, investigations, to, rule, out, any, nefarious, human, action, such, as, stealing, of, 235, u, confirmed, the, theory, by, finding, isotope, ratios, of, common, fission, products, or, rather, their, stable, daughter, nuclides, in, line, with, the, values, expected, for, fission, but, deviating, from, the, values, expected, for, non, fission, derived, samples, of, those, elements, a, person, can, be, exposed, to, uranium, or, its, radioactive, daughters, such, as, radon, by, inhaling, dust, in, air, or, by, ingesting, contaminated, water, and, food, the, amount, of, uranium, in, air, is, usually, very, small, however, people, who, work, in, factories, that, process, phosphate, fertilizers, live, near, government, facilities, that, made, or, tested, nuclear, weapons, live, or, work, near, a, modern, battlefield, where, depleted, uranium, weapons, have, been, used, or, live, or, work, near, a, coal, fired, power, plant, facilities, that, mine, or, process, uranium, ore, or, enrich, uranium, for, reactor, fuel, may, have, increased, exposure, to, uranium, houses, or, structures, that, are, over, uranium, deposits, either, natural, or, man, made, slag, deposits, may, have, an, increased, incidence, of, exposure, to, radon, gas, the, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, osha, has, set, the, permissible, exposure, limit, for, uranium, exposure, in, the, workplace, as, 0, 25, mg, m, 3, over, an, 8, hour, workday, the, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, niosh, has, set, a, recommended, exposure, limit, rel, of, 0, 2, mg, m, 3, over, an, 8, hour, workday, and, a, short, term, limit, of, 0, 6, mg, m, 3, at, 10, mg, m, 3, uranium, is, immediately, dangerous, to, life, and, health, most, ingested, uranium, is, excreted, during, digestion, only, 0, 5, is, absorbed, when, insoluble, forms, of, uranium, such, as, its, oxide, are, ingested, whereas, absorption, of, the, more, soluble, uranyl, ion, can, be, up, to, 5, however, soluble, uranium, compounds, tend, to, quickly, pass, through, the, body, whereas, insoluble, uranium, compounds, especially, when, inhaled, by, way, of, dust, into, the, lungs, pose, a, more, serious, exposure, hazard, after, entering, the, bloodstream, the, absorbed, uranium, tends, to, bioaccumulate, and, stay, for, many, years, in, bone, tissue, because, of, uranium, s, affinity, for, phosphates, incorporated, uranium, becomes, uranyl, ions, which, accumulate, in, bone, liver, kidney, and, reproductive, tissues, radiological, and, chemical, toxicity, of, uranium, combine, by, the, fact, that, elements, of, high, atomic, number, z, like, uranium, exhibit, phantom, or, secondary, radiotoxicity, through, absorption, of, natural, background, gamma, and, x, rays, and, re, emission, of, photoelectrons, which, in, combination, with, the, high, affinity, of, uranium, to, the, phosphate, moiety, of, dna, cause, increased, single, and, double, strand, dna, breaks, uranium, is, not, absorbed, through, the, skin, and, alpha, particles, released, by, uranium, cannot, penetrate, the, skin, uranium, can, be, decontaminated, from, steel, surfaces, and, aquifers, normal, functioning, of, the, kidney, brain, liver, heart, and, other, systems, can, be, affected, by, uranium, exposure, because, besides, being, weakly, radioactive, uranium, is, a, toxic, metal, uranium, is, also, a, reproductive, toxicant, radiological, effects, are, generally, local, because, alpha, radiation, the, primary, form, of, 238, u, decay, has, a, very, short, range, and, will, not, penetrate, skin, alpha, radiation, from, inhaled, uranium, has, been, demonstrated, to, cause, lung, cancer, in, exposed, nuclear, workers, while, the, cdc, has, published, one, study, that, no, human, cancer, has, been, seen, as, a, result, of, exposure, to, natural, or, depleted, uranium, exposure, to, uranium, and, its, decay, products, especially, radon, is, a, significant, health, threat, exposure, to, strontium, 90, iodine, 131, and, other, fission, products, is, unrelated, to, uranium, exposure, but, may, result, from, medical, procedures, or, exposure, to, spent, reactor, fuel, or, fallout, from, nuclear, weapons, although, accidental, inhalation, exposure, to, a, high, concentration, of, uranium, hexafluoride, has, resulted, in, human, fatalities, those, deaths, were, associated, with, the, generation, of, highly, toxic, hydrofluoric, acid, and, uranyl, fluoride, rather, than, with, uranium, itself, finely, divided, uranium, metal, presents, a, fire, hazard, because, uranium, is, pyrophoric, small, grains, will, ignite, spontaneously, in, air, at, room, temperature, uranium, metal, is, commonly, handled, with, gloves, as, a, sufficient, precaution, uranium, concentrate, is, handled, and, contained, so, as, to, ensure, that, people, do, not, inhale, or, ingest, it
