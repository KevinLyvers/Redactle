analytical, chemistry, studies, and, uses, instruments, and, methods, to, separate, identify, and, quantify, matter, in, practice, separation, identification, or, quantification, may, constitute, the, entire, analysis, or, be, combined, with, another, method, separation, isolates, analytes, qualitative, analysis, identifies, analytes, while, quantitative, analysis, determines, the, numerical, amount, or, concentration, analytical, chemistry, consists, of, classical, wet, chemical, methods, and, modern, instrumental, methods, classical, qualitative, methods, use, separations, such, as, precipitation, extraction, and, distillation, identification, may, be, based, on, differences, in, color, odor, melting, point, boiling, point, solubility, radioactivity, or, reactivity, classical, quantitative, analysis, uses, mass, or, volume, changes, to, quantify, amount, instrumental, methods, may, be, used, to, separate, samples, using, chromatography, electrophoresis, or, field, flow, fractionation, then, qualitative, and, quantitative, analysis, can, be, performed, often, with, the, same, instrument, and, may, use, light, interaction, heat, interaction, electric, fields, or, magnetic, fields, often, the, same, instrument, can, separate, identify, and, quantify, an, analyte, analytical, chemistry, is, also, focused, on, improvements, in, experimental, design, chemometrics, and, the, creation, of, new, measurement, tools, analytical, chemistry, has, broad, applications, to, medicine, science, and, engineering, analytical, chemistry, has, been, important, since, the, early, days, of, chemistry, providing, methods, for, determining, which, elements, and, chemicals, are, present, in, the, object, in, question, during, this, period, significant, contributions, to, analytical, chemistry, included, the, development, of, systematic, elemental, analysis, by, justus, von, liebig, and, systematized, organic, analysis, based, on, the, specific, reactions, of, functional, groups, the, first, instrumental, analysis, was, flame, emissive, spectrometry, developed, by, robert, bunsen, and, gustav, kirchhoff, who, discovered, rubidium, rb, and, caesium, cs, in, 1860, most, of, the, major, developments, in, analytical, chemistry, took, place, after, 1900, during, this, period, instrumental, analysis, became, progressively, dominant, in, the, field, in, particular, many, of, the, basic, spectroscopic, and, spectrometric, techniques, were, discovered, in, the, early, 20th, century, and, refined, in, the, late, 20th, century, the, separation, sciences, follow, a, similar, time, line, of, development, and, also, became, increasingly, transformed, into, high, performance, instruments, in, the, 1970s, many, of, these, techniques, began, to, be, used, together, as, hybrid, techniques, to, achieve, a, complete, characterization, of, samples, starting, in, the, 1970s, analytical, chemistry, became, progressively, more, inclusive, of, biological, questions, bioanalytical, chemistry, whereas, it, had, previously, been, largely, focused, on, inorganic, or, small, organic, molecules, lasers, have, been, increasingly, used, as, probes, and, even, to, initiate, and, influence, a, wide, variety, of, reactions, the, late, 20th, century, also, saw, an, expansion, of, the, application, of, analytical, chemistry, from, somewhat, academic, chemical, questions, to, forensic, environmental, industrial, and, medical, questions, such, as, in, histology, modern, analytical, chemistry, is, dominated, by, instrumental, analysis, many, analytical, chemists, focus, on, a, single, type, of, instrument, academics, tend, to, either, focus, on, new, applications, and, discoveries, or, on, new, methods, of, analysis, the, discovery, of, a, chemical, present, in, blood, that, increases, the, risk, of, cancer, would, be, a, discovery, that, an, analytical, chemist, might, be, involved, in, an, effort, to, develop, a, new, method, might, involve, the, use, of, a, tunable, laser, to, increase, the, specificity, and, sensitivity, of, a, spectrometric, method, many, methods, once, developed, are, kept, purposely, static, so, that, data, can, be, compared, over, long, periods, of, time, this, is, particularly, true, in, industrial, quality, assurance, qa, forensic, and, environmental, applications, analytical, chemistry, plays, an, increasingly, important, role, in, the, pharmaceutical, industry, where, aside, from, qa, it, is, used, in, the, discovery, of, new, drug, candidates, and, in, clinical, applications, where, understanding, the, interactions, between, the, drug, and, the, patient, are, critical, although, modern, analytical, chemistry, is, dominated, by, sophisticated, instrumentation, the, roots, of, analytical, chemistry, and, some, of, the, principles, used, in, modern, instruments, are, from, traditional, techniques, many, of, which, are, still, used, today, these, techniques, also, tend, to, form, the, backbone, of, most, undergraduate, analytical, chemistry, educational, labs, qualitative, analysis, determines, the, presence, or, absence, of, a, particular, compound, but, not, the, mass, or, concentration, by, definition, qualitative, analyses, do, not, measure, quantity, there, are, numerous, qualitative, chemical, tests, for, example, the, acid, test, for, gold, and, the, kastle, meyer, test, for, the, presence, of, blood, inorganic, qualitative, analysis, generally, refers, to, a, systematic, scheme, to, confirm, the, presence, of, certain, aqueous, ions, or, elements, by, performing, a, series, of, reactions, that, eliminate, a, range, of, possibilities, and, then, confirm, suspected, ions, with, a, confirming, test, sometimes, small, carbon, containing, ions, are, included, in, such, schemes, with, modern, instrumentation, these, tests, are, rarely, used, but, can, be, useful, for, educational, purposes, and, in, fieldwork, or, other, situations, where, access, to, state, of, the, art, instruments, is, not, available, or, expedient, quantitative, analysis, is, the, measurement, of, the, quantities, of, particular, chemical, constituents, present, in, a, substance, quantities, can, be, measured, by, mass, gravimetric, analysis, or, volume, volumetric, analysis, the, gravimetric, analysis, involves, determining, the, amount, of, material, present, by, weighing, the, sample, before, and, or, after, some, transformation, a, common, example, used, in, undergraduate, education, is, the, determination, of, the, amount, of, water, in, a, hydrate, by, heating, the, sample, to, remove, the, water, such, that, the, difference, in, weight, is, due, to, the, loss, of, water, titration, involves, the, gradual, addition, of, a, measurable, reactant, to, an, exact, volume, of, a, solution, being, analyzed, until, some, equivalence, point, is, reached, titrating, accurately, to, either, the, half, equivalence, point, or, the, endpoint, of, a, titration, allows, the, chemist, to, determine, the, amount, of, moles, used, which, can, then, be, used, to, determine, a, concentration, or, composition, of, the, titrant, most, familiar, to, those, who, have, taken, chemistry, during, secondary, education, is, the, acid, base, titration, involving, a, color, changing, indicator, such, as, phenolphthalein, there, are, many, other, types, of, titrations, for, example, potentiometric, titrations, or, precipitation, titrations, chemists, might, also, create, titration, curves, in, order, by, systematically, testing, the, ph, every, drop, in, order, to, understand, different, properties, of, the, titrant, spectroscopy, measures, the, interaction, of, the, molecules, with, electromagnetic, radiation, spectroscopy, consists, of, many, different, applications, such, as, atomic, absorption, spectroscopy, atomic, emission, spectroscopy, ultraviolet, visible, spectroscopy, x, ray, spectroscopy, fluorescence, spectroscopy, infrared, spectroscopy, raman, spectroscopy, dual, polarization, interferometry, nuclear, magnetic, resonance, spectroscopy, photoemission, spectroscopy, m, ssbauer, spectroscopy, and, so, on, mass, spectrometry, measures, mass, to, charge, ratio, of, molecules, using, electric, and, magnetic, fields, there, are, several, ionization, methods, electron, ionization, chemical, ionization, electrospray, ionization, fast, atom, bombardment, matrix, assisted, laser, desorption, ionization, and, others, also, mass, spectrometry, is, categorized, by, approaches, of, mass, analyzers, magnetic, sector, quadrupole, mass, analyzer, quadrupole, ion, trap, time, of, flight, fourier, transform, ion, cyclotron, resonance, and, so, on, electroanalytical, methods, measure, the, potential, volts, and, or, current, amps, in, an, electrochemical, cell, containing, the, analyte, these, methods, can, be, categorized, according, to, which, aspects, of, the, cell, are, controlled, and, which, are, measured, the, four, main, categories, are, potentiometry, the, difference, in, electrode, potentials, is, measured, coulometry, the, transferred, charge, is, measured, over, time, amperometry, the, cell, s, current, is, measured, over, time, and, voltammetry, the, cell, s, current, is, measured, while, actively, altering, the, cell, s, potential, calorimetry, and, thermogravimetric, analysis, measure, the, interaction, of, a, material, and, heat, separation, processes, are, used, to, decrease, the, complexity, of, material, mixtures, chromatography, electrophoresis, and, field, flow, fractionation, are, representative, of, this, field, chromatography, can, be, used, to, determine, the, presence, of, substances, in, a, sample, as, different, components, in, a, mixture, have, different, tendencies, to, adsorb, onto, the, stationary, phase, or, dissolve, in, the, mobile, phase, thus, different, components, of, the, mixture, move, at, different, speed, different, components, of, a, mixture, can, therefore, be, identified, by, their, respective, r, values, which, is, the, ratio, between, the, migration, distance, of, the, substance, and, the, migration, distance, of, the, solvent, front, during, chromatography, in, combination, with, the, instrumental, methods, chromatography, can, be, used, in, quantitative, determination, of, the, substances, combinations, of, the, above, techniques, produce, a, hybrid, or, hyphenated, technique, several, examples, are, in, popular, use, today, and, new, hybrid, techniques, are, under, development, for, example, gas, chromatography, mass, spectrometry, gas, chromatography, infrared, spectroscopy, liquid, chromatography, mass, spectrometry, liquid, chromatography, nmr, spectroscopy, liquid, chromatography, infrared, spectroscopy, and, capillary, electrophoresis, mass, spectrometry, hyphenated, separation, techniques, refer, to, a, combination, of, two, or, more, techniques, to, detect, and, separate, chemicals, from, solutions, most, often, the, other, technique, is, some, form, of, chromatography, hyphenated, techniques, are, widely, used, in, chemistry, and, biochemistry, a, slash, is, sometimes, used, instead, of, hyphen, especially, if, the, name, of, one, of, the, methods, contains, a, hyphen, itself, the, visualization, of, single, molecules, single, cells, biological, tissues, and, nanomaterials, is, an, important, and, attractive, approach, in, analytical, science, also, hybridization, with, other, traditional, analytical, tools, is, revolutionizing, analytical, science, microscopy, can, be, categorized, into, three, different, fields, optical, microscopy, electron, microscopy, and, scanning, probe, microscopy, recently, this, field, is, rapidly, progressing, because, of, the, rapid, development, of, the, computer, and, camera, industries, devices, that, integrate, multiple, laboratory, functions, on, a, single, chip, of, only, millimeters, to, a, few, square, centimeters, in, size, and, that, are, capable, of, handling, extremely, small, fluid, volumes, down, to, less, than, picoliters, error, can, be, defined, as, numerical, difference, between, observed, value, and, true, value, the, experimental, error, can, be, divided, into, two, types, systematic, error, and, random, error, systematic, error, results, from, a, flaw, in, equipment, or, the, design, of, an, experiment, while, random, error, results, from, uncontrolled, or, uncontrollable, variables, in, the, experiment, in, error, the, true, value, and, observed, value, in, chemical, analysis, can, be, related, with, each, other, by, the, equation, where, an, error, of, a, measurement, is, an, inverse, measure, of, accurate, measurement, i, e, smaller, the, error, greater, the, accuracy, of, the, measurement, errors, can, be, expressed, relatively, given, the, relative, error, r, displaystyle, varepsilon, rm, r, the, percent, error, can, also, be, calculated, if, we, want, to, use, these, values, in, a, function, we, may, also, want, to, calculate, the, error, of, the, function, let, f, displaystyle, f, be, a, function, with, n, displaystyle, n, variables, therefore, the, propagation, of, uncertainty, must, be, calculated, in, order, to, know, the, error, in, f, displaystyle, f, a, general, method, for, analysis, of, concentration, involves, the, creation, of, a, calibration, curve, this, allows, for, the, determination, of, the, amount, of, a, chemical, in, a, material, by, comparing, the, results, of, an, unknown, sample, to, those, of, a, series, of, known, standards, if, the, concentration, of, element, or, compound, in, a, sample, is, too, high, for, the, detection, range, of, the, technique, it, can, simply, be, diluted, in, a, pure, solvent, if, the, amount, in, the, sample, is, below, an, instrument, s, range, of, measurement, the, method, of, addition, can, be, used, in, this, method, a, known, quantity, of, the, element, or, compound, under, study, is, added, and, the, difference, between, the, concentration, added, and, the, concentration, observed, is, the, amount, actually, in, the, sample, sometimes, an, internal, standard, is, added, at, a, known, concentration, directly, to, an, analytical, sample, to, aid, in, quantitation, the, amount, of, analyte, present, is, then, determined, relative, to, the, internal, standard, as, a, calibrant, an, ideal, internal, standard, is, an, isotopically, enriched, analyte, which, gives, rise, to, the, method, of, isotope, dilution, the, method, of, standard, addition, is, used, in, instrumental, analysis, to, determine, the, concentration, of, a, substance, analyte, in, an, unknown, sample, by, comparison, to, a, set, of, samples, of, known, concentration, similar, to, using, a, calibration, curve, standard, addition, can, be, applied, to, most, analytical, techniques, and, is, used, instead, of, a, calibration, curve, to, solve, the, matrix, effect, problem, one, of, the, most, important, components, of, analytical, chemistry, is, maximizing, the, desired, signal, while, minimizing, the, associated, noise, the, analytical, figure, of, merit, is, known, as, the, signal, to, noise, ratio, s, n, or, snr, noise, can, arise, from, environmental, factors, as, well, as, from, fundamental, physical, processes, thermal, noise, results, from, the, motion, of, charge, carriers, usually, electrons, in, an, electrical, circuit, generated, by, their, thermal, motion, thermal, noise, is, white, noise, meaning, that, the, power, spectral, density, is, constant, throughout, the, frequency, spectrum, the, root, mean, square, value, of, the, thermal, noise, in, a, resistor, is, given, by, where, k, b, is, the, boltzmann, constant, t, is, the, temperature, r, is, the, resistance, and, f, displaystyle, delta, f, is, the, bandwidth, of, the, frequency, f, displaystyle, f, shot, noise, is, a, type, of, electronic, noise, that, occurs, when, the, finite, number, of, particles, such, as, electrons, in, an, electronic, circuit, or, photons, in, an, optical, device, is, small, enough, to, give, rise, to, statistical, fluctuations, in, a, signal, shot, noise, is, a, poisson, process, and, the, charge, carriers, that, make, up, the, current, follow, a, poisson, distribution, the, root, mean, square, current, fluctuation, is, given, by, where, e, is, the, elementary, charge, and, i, is, the, average, current, shot, noise, is, white, noise, flicker, noise, is, electronic, noise, with, a, 1, frequency, spectrum, as, f, increases, the, noise, decreases, flicker, noise, arises, from, a, variety, of, sources, such, as, impurities, in, a, conductive, channel, generation, and, recombination, noise, in, a, transistor, due, to, base, current, and, so, on, this, noise, can, be, avoided, by, modulation, of, the, signal, at, a, higher, frequency, for, example, through, the, use, of, a, lock, in, amplifier, environmental, noise, arises, from, the, surroundings, of, the, analytical, instrument, sources, of, electromagnetic, noise, are, power, lines, radio, and, television, stations, wireless, devices, compact, fluorescent, lamps, and, electric, motors, many, of, these, noise, sources, are, narrow, bandwidth, and, therefore, can, be, avoided, temperature, and, vibration, isolation, may, be, required, for, some, instruments, noise, reduction, can, be, accomplished, either, in, computer, hardware, or, software, examples, of, hardware, noise, reduction, are, the, use, of, shielded, cable, analog, filtering, and, signal, modulation, examples, of, software, noise, reduction, are, digital, filtering, ensemble, average, boxcar, average, and, correlation, methods, analytical, chemistry, has, applications, including, in, forensic, science, bioanalysis, clinical, analysis, environmental, analysis, and, materials, analysis, analytical, chemistry, research, is, largely, driven, by, performance, sensitivity, detection, limit, selectivity, robustness, dynamic, range, linear, range, accuracy, precision, and, speed, and, cost, purchase, operation, training, time, and, space, among, the, main, branches, of, contemporary, analytical, atomic, spectrometry, the, most, widespread, and, universal, are, optical, and, mass, spectrometry, in, the, direct, elemental, analysis, of, solid, samples, the, new, leaders, are, laser, induced, breakdown, and, laser, ablation, mass, spectrometry, and, the, related, techniques, with, transfer, of, the, laser, ablation, products, into, inductively, coupled, plasma, advances, in, design, of, diode, lasers, and, optical, parametric, oscillators, promote, developments, in, fluorescence, and, ionization, spectrometry, and, also, in, absorption, techniques, where, uses, of, optical, cavities, for, increased, effective, absorption, pathlength, are, expected, to, expand, the, use, of, plasma, and, laser, based, methods, is, increasing, an, interest, towards, absolute, standardless, analysis, has, revived, particularly, in, emission, spectrometry, great, effort, is, being, put, into, shrinking, the, analysis, techniques, to, chip, size, although, there, are, few, examples, of, such, systems, competitive, with, traditional, analysis, techniques, potential, advantages, include, size, portability, speed, and, cost, micro, total, analysis, system, tas, or, lab, on, a, chip, microscale, chemistry, reduces, the, amounts, of, chemicals, used, many, developments, improve, the, analysis, of, biological, systems, examples, of, rapidly, expanding,

modifications, especially, in, response, to, various, stressors, at, various, developmental, stages, or, in, various, parts, of, the, body, metabolomics, which, deals, with, metabolites, transcriptomics, including, mrna, and, associated, fields, lipidomics, lipids, and, its, associated, fields, peptidomics, peptides, and, its, associated, fields, and, metallomics, dealing, with, metal, concentrations, and, especially, with, their, binding, to, proteins, and, other, molecules, analytical, chemistry, has, played, a, critical, role, in, the, understanding, of, basic, science, to, a, variety, of, practical, applications, such, as, biomedical, applications, environmental, monitoring, quality, control, of, industrial, manufacturing, forensic, science, and, so, on, the, recent, developments, in, computer, automation, and, information, technologies, have, extended, analytical, chemistry, into, a, number, of, new, biological, fields, for, example, automated, dna, sequencing, machines, were, the, basis, for, completing, human, genome, projects, leading, to, the, birth, of, genomics, protein, identification, and, peptide, sequencing, by, mass, spectrometry, opened, a, new, field, of, proteomics, in, addition, to, automating, specific, processes, there, is, effort, to, automate, larger, sections, of, lab, testing, such, as, in, companies, like, emerald,
