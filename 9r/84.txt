https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observatory
an, observatory, is, a, location, used, for, observing, terrestrial, marine, or, celestial, events, astronomy, climatology, meteorology, geophysics, oceanography, and, volcanology, are, examples, of, disciplines, for, which, observatories, have, been, constructed, astronomical, observatories, are, mainly, divided, into, four, categories, space, based, airborne, ground, based, and, underground, based, historically, ground, based, observatories, were, as, simple, as, containing, an, astronomical, sextant, for, measuring, the, distance, between, stars, or, stonehenge, which, has, some, alignments, on, astronomical, phenomena, ground, based, observatories, located, on, the, surface, of, earth, are, used, to, make, observations, in, the, radio, and, visible, light, portions, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, most, optical, telescopes, are, housed, within, a, dome, or, similar, structure, to, protect, the, delicate, instruments, from, the, elements, telescope, domes, have, a, slit, or, other, opening, in, the, roof, that, can, be, opened, during, observing, and, closed, when, the, telescope, is, not, in, use, in, most, cases, the, entire, upper, portion, of, the, telescope, dome, can, be, rotated, to, allow, the, instrument, to, observe, different, sections, of, the, night, sky, radio, telescopes, usually, do, not, have, domes, for, optical, telescopes, most, ground, based, observatories, are, located, far, from, major, centers, of, population, to, avoid, the, effects, of, light, pollution, the, ideal, locations, for, modern, observatories, are, sites, that, have, dark, skies, a, large, percentage, of, clear, nights, per, year, dry, air, and, are, at, high, elevations, at, high, elevations, the, earth, s, atmosphere, is, thinner, thereby, minimizing, the, effects, of, atmospheric, turbulence, and, resulting, in, better, astronomical, seeing, sites, that, meet, the, above, criteria, for, modern, observatories, include, the, southwestern, united, states, hawaii, canary, islands, the, andes, and, high, mountains, in, mexico, such, as, sierra, negra, major, optical, observatories, include, mauna, kea, observatory, and, kitt, peak, national, observatory, in, the, us, roque, de, los, muchachos, observatory, in, spain, and, paranal, observatory, and, cerro, tololo, inter, american, observatory, in, chile, specific, research, study, performed, in, 2009, shows, that, the, best, possible, location, for, ground, based, observatory, on, earth, is, ridge, a, a, place, in, the, central, part, of, eastern, antarctica, this, location, provides, the, least, atmospheric, disturbances, and, best, visibility, beginning, in, 1933, radio, telescopes, have, been, built, for, use, in, the, field, of, radio, astronomy, to, observe, the, universe, in, the, radio, portion, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, such, an, instrument, or, collection, of, instruments, with, supporting, facilities, such, as, control, centres, visitor, housing, data, reduction, centers, and, or, maintenance, facilities, are, called, radio, observatories, radio, observatories, are, similarly, located, far, from, major, population, centers, to, avoid, electromagnetic, interference, emi, from, radio, tv, radar, and, other, emi, emitting, devices, but, unlike, optical, observatories, radio, observatories, can, be, placed, in, valleys, for, further, emi, shielding, some, of, the, world, s, major, radio, observatories, include, the, very, large, array, in, new, mexico, united, states, jodrell, bank, in, the, uk, arecibo, in, puerto, rico, parkes, in, new, south, wales, australia, and, chajnantor, in, chile, a, related, discipline, is, very, long, baseline, interferometry, vlbi, since, the, mid, 20th, century, a, number, of, astronomical, observatories, have, been, constructed, at, very, high, altitudes, above, 4, 000, 5, 000, m, 13, 000, 16, 000, ft, the, largest, and, most, notable, of, these, is, the, mauna, kea, observatory, located, near, the, summit, of, a, 4, 205, m, 13, 796, ft, volcano, in, hawai, i, the, chacaltaya, astrophysical, observatory, in, bolivia, at, 5, 230, m, 17, 160, ft, was, the, world, s, highest, permanent, astronomical, observatory, from, the, time, of, its, construction, during, the, 1940s, until, 2009, it, has, now, been, surpassed, by, the, new, university, of, tokyo, atacama, observatory, an, optical, infrared, telescope, on, a, remote, 5, 640, m, 18, 500, ft, mountaintop, in, the, atacama, desert, of, chile, the, oldest, proto, observatories, in, the, sense, of, an, observation, post, for, astronomy, the, oldest, true, observatories, in, the, sense, of, a, specialized, research, institute, include, space, based, observatories, are, telescopes, or, other, instruments, that, are, located, in, outer, space, many, in, orbit, around, the, earth, space, telescopes, can, be, used, to, observe, astronomical, objects, at, wavelengths, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, that, cannot, penetrate, the, earth, s, atmosphere, and, are, thus, impossible, to, observe, using, ground, based, telescopes, the, earth, s, atmosphere, is, opaque, to, ultraviolet, radiation, x, rays, and, gamma, rays, and, is, partially, opaque, to, infrared, radiation, so, observations, in, these, portions, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, are, best, carried, out, from, a, location, above, the, atmosphere, of, our, planet, another, advantage, of, space, based, telescopes, is, that, because, of, their, location, above, the, earth, s, atmosphere, their, images, are, free, from, the, effects, of, atmospheric, turbulence, that, plague, ground, based, observations, as, a, result, the, angular, resolution, of, space, telescopes, such, as, the, hubble, space, telescope, is, often, much, smaller, than, a, ground, based, telescope, with, a, similar, aperture, however, all, these, advantages, do, come, with, a, price, space, telescopes, are, much, more, expensive, to, build, than, ground, based, telescopes, due, to, their, location, space, telescopes, are, also, extremely, difficult, to, maintain, the, hubble, space, telescope, was, able, to, be, serviced, by, the, space, shuttles, while, many, other, space, telescopes, cannot, be, serviced, at, all, airborne, observatories, have, the, advantage, of, height, over, ground, installations, putting, them, above, most, of, the, earth, s, atmosphere, they, also, have, an, advantage, over, space, telescopes, the, instruments, can, be, deployed, repaired, and, updated, much, more, quickly, and, inexpensively, the, kuiper, airborne, observatory, and, the, stratospheric, observatory, for, infrared, astronomy, use, airplanes, to, observe, in, the, infrared, which, is, absorbed, by, water, vapor, in, the, atmosphere, high, altitude, balloons, for, x, ray, astronomy, have, been, used, in, a, variety, of, countries, example, underground, underwater, or, under, ice, neutrino, observatories, include, example, meteorological, observatories, include, a, marine, observatory, is, a, scientific, institution, whose, main, task, is, to, make, observations, in, the, fields, of, meteorology, geomagnetism, and, tides, that, are, important, for, the, navy, and, civil, shipping, an, astronomical, observatory, is, usually, also, attached, some, of, these, observatories, also, deal, with, nautical, weather, forecasts, and, storm, warnings, astronomical, time, services, nautical, calendars, and, seismology, example, marine, observatories, include, a, magnetic, observatory, is, a, facility, which, precisely, measures, the, total, intensity, of, earth, s, magnetic, field, for, field, strength, and, direction, at, standard, intervals, geomagnetic, observatories, are, most, useful, when, located, away, from, human, activities, to, avoid, disturbances, of, anthropogenic, origin, and, the, observation, data, is, collected, at, a, fixed, location, continuously, for, decades, magnetic, observations, are, aggregated, processed, quality, checked, and, made, public, through, data, centers, such, as, intermagnet, the, types, of, measuring, equipment, at, an, observatory, may, include, magnetometers, torsion, declination, inclination, fluxgate, proton, precession, overhauser, effect, variometer, 3, component, vector, total, field, scalar, dip, circle, inclinometer, earth, inductor, theodolite, self, recording, magnetograph, magnetic, declinometer, azimuth, compass, once, a, week, at, the, absolute, reference, point, calibration, measurements, are, performed, example, magnetic, observatories, include, example, seismic, observation, projects, and, observatories, include, example, gravitational, wave, observatories, include, a, volcano, observatory, is, an, institution, that, conducts, the, monitoring, of, a, volcano, as, well, as, research, in, order, to, understand, the, potential, impacts, of, active, volcanism, among, the, best, known, are, the, hawaiian, volcano, observatory, and, the, vesuvius, observatory, mobile, volcano, observatories, exist, with, the, usgs, vdap, volcano, disaster, assistance, program, to, be, deployed, on, demand, each, volcano, observatory, has, a, geographic, area, of, responsibility, it, is, assigned, to, whereby, the, observatory, is, tasked, with, spreading, activity, forecasts, analyzing, potential, volcanic, activity, threats, and, cooperating, with, communities, in, preparation, for, volcanic, eruption
