osmosis, z, m, o, s, s, us, also, s, is, the, spontaneous, net, movement, or, diffusion, of, solvent, molecules, through, a, selectively, permeable, membrane, from, a, region, of, high, water, potential, region, of, lower, solute, concentration, to, a, region, of, low, water, potential, region, of, higher, solute, concentration, in, the, direction, that, tends, to, equalize, the, solute, concentrations, on, the, two, sides, it, may, also, be, used, to, describe, a, physical, process, in, which, any, solvent, moves, across, a, selectively, permeable, membrane, permeable, to, the, solvent, but, not, the, solute, separating, two, solutions, of, different, concentrations, osmosis, can, be, made, to, do, work, osmotic, pressure, is, defined, as, the, external, pressure, required, to, prevent, net, movement, of, solvent, across, the, membrane, osmotic, pressure, is, a, colligative, property, meaning, that, the, osmotic, pressure, depends, on, the, molar, concentration, of, the, solute, but, not, on, its, identity, osmosis, is, a, vital, process, in, biological, systems, as, biological, membranes, are, semipermeable, in, general, these, membranes, are, impermeable, to, large, and, polar, molecules, such, as, ions, proteins, and, polysaccharides, while, being, permeable, to, non, polar, or, hydrophobic, molecules, like, lipids, as, well, as, to, small, molecules, like, oxygen, carbon, dioxide, nitrogen, and, nitric, oxide, permeability, depends, on, solubility, charge, or, chemistry, as, well, as, solute, size, water, molecules, travel, through, the, plasma, membrane, tonoplast, membrane, vacuole, or, organelle, membranes, by, diffusing, across, the, phospholipid, bilayer, via, aquaporins, small, transmembrane, proteins, similar, to, those, responsible, for, facilitated, diffusion, and, ion, channels, osmosis, provides, the, primary, means, by, which, water, is, transported, into, and, out, of, cells, the, turgor, pressure, of, a, cell, is, largely, maintained, by, osmosis, across, the, cell, membrane, between, the, cell, interior, and, its, relatively, hypotonic, environment, some, kinds, of, osmotic, flow, have, been, observed, since, ancient, times, e, g, on, the, construction, of, egyptian, pyramids, jean, antoine, nollet, first, documented, observation, of, osmosis, in, 1748, the, word, osmosis, descends, from, the, words, endosmose, and, exosmose, which, were, coined, by, french, physician, ren, joachim, henri, dutrochet, 1776, 1847, from, the, greek, words, ndon, within, x, outer, external, and, sm, s, push, impulsion, in, 1867, moritz, traube, invented, highly, selective, precipitation, membranes, advancing, the, art, and, technique, of, measurement, of, osmotic, flow, osmosis, is, the, movement, of, a, solvent, across, a, semipermeable, membrane, toward, a, higher, concentration, of, solute, in, biological, systems, the, solvent, is, typically, water, but, osmosis, can, occur, in, other, liquids, supercritical, liquids, and, even, gases, when, a, cell, is, submerged, in, water, the, water, molecules, pass, through, the, cell, membrane, from, an, area, of, low, solute, concentration, to, high, solute, concentration, for, example, if, the, cell, is, submerged, in, saltwater, water, molecules, move, out, of, the, cell, if, a, cell, is, submerged, in, freshwater, water, molecules, move, into, the, cell, when, the, membrane, has, a, volume, of, pure, water, on, both, sides, water, molecules, pass, in, and, out, in, each, direction, at, exactly, the, same, rate, there, is, no, net, flow, of, water, through, the, membrane, osmosis, can, be, demonstrated, when, potato, slices, are, added, to, a, high, salt, solution, the, water, from, inside, the, potato, moves, out, to, the, solution, causing, the, potato, to, shrink, and, to, lose, its, turgor, pressure, the, more, concentrated, the, salt, solution, the, bigger, the, loss, in, size, and, weight, of, the, potato, slice, chemical, gardens, demonstrate, the, effect, of, osmosis, in, inorganic, chemistry, the, mechanism, responsible, for, driving, osmosis, has, commonly, been, represented, in, biology, and, chemistry, texts, as, either, the, dilution, of, water, by, solute, resulting, in, lower, concentration, of, water, on, the, higher, solute, concentration, side, of, the, membrane, and, therefore, a, diffusion, of, water, along, a, concentration, gradient, or, by, a, solute, s, attraction, to, water, resulting, in, less, free, water, on, the, higher, solute, concentration, side, of, the, membrane, and, therefore, net, movement, of, water, toward, the, solute, both, of, these, notions, have, been, conclusively, refuted, the, diffusion, model, of, osmosis, is, rendered, untenable, by, the, fact, that, osmosis, can, drive, water, across, a, membrane, toward, a, higher, concentration, of, water, the, bound, water, model, is, refuted, by, the, fact, that, osmosis, is, independent, of, the, size, of, the, solute, molecules, a, colligative, property, or, how, hydrophilic, they, are, it, is, difficult, to, describe, osmosis, without, a, mechanical, or, thermodynamic, explanation, but, essentially, there, is, an, interaction, between, the, solute, and, water, that, counteracts, the, pressure, that, otherwise, free, solute, molecules, would, exert, one, fact, to, take, note, of, is, that, heat, from, the, surroundings, is, able, to, be, converted, into, mechanical, energy, water, rising, many, thermodynamic, explanations, go, into, the, concept, of, chemical, potential, and, how, the, function, of, the, water, on, the, solution, side, differs, from, that, of, pure, water, due, to, the, higher, pressure, and, the, presence, of, the, solute, counteracting, such, that, the, chemical, potential, remains, unchanged, the, virial, theorem, demonstrates, that, attraction, between, the, molecules, water, and, solute, reduces, the, pressure, and, thus, the, pressure, exerted, by, water, molecules, on, each, other, in, solution, is, less, than, in, pure, water, allowing, pure, water, to, force, the, solution, until, the, pressure, reaches, equilibrium, osmotic, pressure, is, the, main, agent, of, support, in, many, plants, the, osmotic, entry, of, water, raises, the, turgor, pressure, exerted, against, the, cell, wall, until, it, equals, the, osmotic, pressure, creating, a, steady, state, when, a, plant, cell, is, placed, in, a, solution, that, is, hypertonic, relative, to, the, cytoplasm, water, moves, out, of, the, cell, and, the, cell, shrinks, in, doing, so, the, cell, becomes, flaccid, in, extreme, cases, the, cell, becomes, plasmolyzed, the, cell, membrane, disengages, with, the, cell, wall, due, to, lack, of, water, pressure, on, it, when, a, plant, cell, is, placed, in, a, solution, that, is, hypotonic, relative, to, the, cytoplasm, water, moves, into, the, cell, and, the, cell, swells, to, become, turgid, osmosis, also, plays, a, vital, role, in, human, cells, by, facilitating, the, movement, of, water, across, cell, membranes, this, process, is, crucial, for, maintaining, proper, cell, hydration, as, cells, can, be, sensitive, to, dehydration, or, overhydration, in, human, cells, osmosis, is, essential, for, maintaining, the, balance, of, water, and, solutes, ensuring, optimal, cellular, function, imbalances, in, osmotic, pressure, can, lead, to, cellular, dysfunction, highlighting, the, importance, of, osmosis, in, sustaining, the, health, and, integrity, of, human, cells, in, certain, environments, osmosis, can, be, harmful, to, organisms, freshwater, and, saltwater, aquarium, fish, for, example, will, quickly, die, should, they, be, placed, in, water, of, a, maladaptive, salinity, the, osmotic, effect, of, table, salt, to, kill, leeches, and, slugs, is, another, example, of, a, way, osmosis, can, cause, harm, to, organisms, suppose, an, animal, or, plant, cell, is, placed, in, a, solution, of, sugar, or, salt, in, water, this, means, that, if, a, cell, is, put, in, a, solution, which, has, a, solute, concentration, higher, than, its, own, it, will, shrivel, and, if, it, is, put, in, a, solution, with, a, lower, solute, concentration, than, its, own, the, cell, will, swell, and, may, even, burst, osmosis, may, be, opposed, by, increasing, the, pressure, in, the, region, of, high, solute, concentration, with, respect, to, that, in, the, low, solute, concentration, region, the, force, per, unit, area, or, pressure, required, to, prevent, the, passage, of, water, or, any, other, high, liquidity, solution, through, a, selectively, permeable, membrane, and, into, a, solution, of, greater, concentration, is, equivalent, to, the, osmotic, pressure, of, the, solution, or, turgor, osmotic, pressure, is, a, colligative, property, meaning, that, the, property, depends, on, the, concentration, of, the, solute, but, not, on, its, content, or, chemical, identity, the, osmotic, gradient, is, the, difference, in, concentration, between, two, solutions, on, either, side, of, a, semipermeable, membrane, and, is, used, to, tell, the, difference, in, percentages, of, the, concentration, of, a, specific, particle, dissolved, in, a, solution, usually, the, osmotic, gradient, is, used, while, comparing, solutions, that, have, a, semipermeable, membrane, between, them, allowing, water, to, diffuse, between, the, two, solutions, toward, the, hypertonic, solution, the, solution, with, the, higher, concentration, eventually, the, force, of, the, column, of, water, on, the, hypertonic, side, of, the, semipermeable, membrane, will, equal, the, force, of, diffusion, on, the, hypotonic, the, side, with, a, lesser, concentration, side, creating, equilibrium, when, equilibrium, is, reached, water, continues, to, flow, but, it, flows, both, ways, in, equal, amounts, as, well, as, force, therefore, stabilizing, the, solution, reverse, osmosis, is, a, separation, process, that, uses, pressure, to, force, a, solvent, through, a, semi, permeable, membrane, that, retains, the, solute, on, one, side, and, allows, the, pure, solvent, to, pass, to, the, other, side, forcing, it, from, a, region, of, high, solute, concentration, through, a, membrane, to, a, region, of, low, solute, concentration, by, applying, a, pressure, in, excess, of, the, osmotic, pressure, this, process, is, known, primarily, for, its, role, in, turning, seawater, into, drinking, water, when, salt, and, other, unwanted, substances, are, ridded, from, the, water, molecules, osmosis, may, be, used, directly, to, achieve, separation, of, water, from, a, solution, containing, unwanted, solutes, a, draw, solution, of, higher, osmotic, pressure, than, the, feed, solution, is, used, to, induce, a, net, flow, of, water, through, a, semi, permeable, membrane, such, that, the, feed, solution, becomes, concentrated, as, the, draw, solution, becomes, dilute, the, diluted, draw, solution, may, then, be, used, directly, as, with, an, ingestible, solute, like, glucose, or, sent, to, a, secondary, separation, process, for, the, removal, of, the, draw, solute, this, secondary, separation, can, be, more, efficient, than, a, reverse, osmosis, process, would, be, alone, depending, on, the, draw, solute, used, and, the, feedwater, treated, forward, osmosis, is, an, area, of, ongoing, research, focusing, on, applications, in, desalination, water, purification, water, treatment, food, processing, and, other, areas, of, study, future, developments, in, osmosis, and, osmosis, research, hold, promise, for, a, range, of, applications, researchers, are, exploring, advanced, materials, for, more, efficient, osmotic, processes, leading, to, improved, water, desalination, and, purification, technologies, additionally, the, integration, of, osmotic, power, generation, where, the, osmotic, pressure, difference, between, saltwater, and, freshwater, is, harnessed, for, energy, presents, a, sustainable, and, renewable, energy, source, with, significant, potential, furthermore, the, field, of, medical, research, is, looking, at, innovative, drug, delivery, systems, that, utilize, osmotic, principles, offering, precise, and, controlled, administration, of, medications, within, the, body, as, technology, and, understanding, in, this, field, continue, to, evolve, the, applications, of, osmosis, are, expected, to, expand, addressing, various, global, challenges, in, water, sustainability, energy, generation, and, healthcare, original, text, avant, que, de, finir, ce, m, moire, je,
