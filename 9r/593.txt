magma, from, ancient, greek, m, gma, thick, unguent, is, the, molten, or, semi, molten, natural, material, from, which, all, igneous, rocks, are, formed, magma, sometimes, colloquially, but, incorrectly, referred, to, as, lava, is, found, beneath, the, surface, of, the, earth, and, evidence, of, magmatism, has, also, been, discovered, on, other, terrestrial, planets, and, some, natural, satellites, besides, molten, rock, magma, may, also, contain, suspended, crystals, and, gas, bubbles, magma, is, produced, by, melting, of, the, mantle, or, the, crust, in, various, tectonic, settings, which, on, earth, include, subduction, zones, continental, rift, zones, mid, ocean, ridges, and, hotspots, mantle, and, crustal, melts, migrate, upwards, through, the, crust, where, they, are, thought, to, be, stored, in, magma, chambers, or, trans, crustal, crystal, rich, mush, zones, during, magma, s, storage, in, the, crust, its, composition, may, be, modified, by, fractional, crystallization, contamination, with, crustal, melts, magma, mixing, and, degassing, following, its, ascent, through, the, crust, magma, may, feed, a, volcano, and, be, extruded, as, lava, or, it, may, solidify, underground, to, form, an, intrusion, such, as, a, dike, a, sill, a, laccolith, a, pluton, or, a, batholith, while, the, study, of, magma, has, relied, on, observing, magma, after, its, transition, into, a, lava, flow, magma, has, been, encountered, in, situ, three, times, during, geothermal, drilling, projects, twice, in, iceland, see, use, in, energy, production, and, once, in, hawaii, magma, consists, of, liquid, rock, that, usually, contains, suspended, solid, crystals, as, magma, approaches, the, surface, and, the, overburden, pressure, drops, dissolved, gases, bubble, out, of, the, liquid, so, that, magma, near, the, surface, consists, of, materials, in, solid, liquid, and, gas, phases, most, magma, is, rich, in, silica, rare, nonsilicate, magma, can, form, by, local, melting, of, nonsilicate, mineral, deposits, or, by, separation, of, a, magma, into, separate, immiscible, silicate, and, nonsilicate, liquid, phases, silicate, magmas, are, molten, mixtures, dominated, by, oxygen, and, silicon, the, most, abundant, chemical, elements, in, the, earth, s, crust, with, smaller, quantities, of, aluminium, calcium, magnesium, iron, sodium, and, potassium, and, minor, amounts, of, many, other, elements, petrologists, routinely, express, the, composition, of, a, silicate, magma, in, terms, of, the, weight, or, molar, mass, fraction, of, the, oxides, of, the, major, elements, other, than, oxygen, present, in, the, magma, because, many, of, the, properties, of, a, magma, such, as, its, viscosity, and, temperature, are, observed, to, correlate, with, silica, content, silicate, magmas, are, divided, into, four, chemical, types, based, on, silica, content, felsic, intermediate, mafic, and, ultramafic, felsic, or, silicic, magmas, have, a, silica, content, greater, than, 63, they, include, rhyolite, and, dacite, magmas, with, such, a, high, silica, content, these, magmas, are, extremely, viscous, ranging, from, 10, 8, cp, 10, 5, pa, s, for, hot, rhyolite, magma, at, 1, 200, c, 2, 190, f, to, 10, 11, cp, 10, 8, pa, s, for, cool, rhyolite, magma, at, 800, c, 1, 470, f, for, comparison, water, has, a, viscosity, of, about, 1, cp, 0, 001, pa, s, because, of, this, very, high, viscosity, felsic, lavas, usually, erupt, explosively, to, produce, pyroclastic, fragmental, deposits, however, rhyolite, lavas, occasionally, erupt, effusively, to, form, lava, spines, lava, domes, or, coulees, which, are, thick, short, lava, flows, the, lavas, typically, fragment, as, they, extrude, producing, block, lava, flows, these, often, contain, obsidian, felsic, lavas, can, erupt, at, temperatures, as, low, as, 800, c, 1, 470, f, unusually, hot, 950, c, 1, 740, f, rhyolite, lavas, however, may, flow, for, distances, of, many, tens, of, kilometres, such, as, in, the, snake, river, plain, of, the, northwestern, united, states, intermediate, or, andesitic, magmas, contain, 52, to, 63, silica, and, are, lower, in, aluminium, and, usually, somewhat, richer, in, magnesium, and, iron, than, felsic, magmas, intermediate, lavas, form, andesite, domes, and, block, lavas, and, may, occur, on, steep, composite, volcanoes, such, as, in, the, andes, they, are, also, commonly, hotter, in, the, range, of, 850, to, 1, 100, c, 1, 560, to, 2, 010, f, because, of, their, lower, silica, content, and, higher, eruptive, temperatures, they, tend, to, be, much, less, viscous, with, a, typical, viscosity, of, 3, 5, 10, 6, cp, 3, 500, pa, s, at, 1, 200, c, 2, 190, f, this, is, slightly, greater, than, the, viscosity, of, smooth, peanut, butter, intermediate, magmas, show, a, greater, tendency, to, form, phenocrysts, higher, iron, and, magnesium, tends, to, manifest, as, a, darker, groundmass, including, amphibole, or, pyroxene, phenocrysts, mafic, or, basaltic, magmas, have, a, silica, content, of, 52, to, 45, they, are, typified, by, their, high, ferromagnesian, content, and, generally, erupt, at, temperatures, of, 1, 100, to, 1, 200, c, 2, 010, to, 2, 190, f, viscosities, can, be, relatively, low, around, 10, 4, to, 10, 5, cp, 10, to, 100, pa, s, although, this, is, still, many, orders, of, magnitude, higher, than, water, this, viscosity, is, similar, to, that, of, ketchup, basalt, lavas, tend, to, produce, low, profile, shield, volcanoes, or, flood, basalts, because, the, fluidal, lava, flows, for, long, distances, from, the, vent, the, thickness, of, a, basalt, lava, particularly, on, a, low, slope, may, be, much, greater, than, the, thickness, of, the, moving, lava, flow, at, any, one, time, because, basalt, lavas, may, inflate, by, supply, of, lava, beneath, a, solidified, crust, most, basalt, lavas, are, of, a, or, p, hoehoe, types, rather, than, block, lavas, underwater, they, can, form, pillow, lavas, which, are, rather, similar, to, entrail, type, pahoehoe, lavas, on, land, ultramafic, magmas, such, as, picritic, basalt, komatiite, and, highly, magnesian, magmas, that, form, boninite, take, the, composition, and, temperatures, to, the, extreme, all, have, a, silica, content, under, 45, komatiites, contain, over, 18, magnesium, oxide, and, are, thought, to, have, erupted, at, temperatures, of, 1, 600, c, 2, 910, f, at, this, temperature, there, is, practically, no, polymerization, of, the, mineral, compounds, creating, a, highly, mobile, liquid, viscosities, of, komatiite, magmas, are, thought, to, have, been, as, low, as, 100, to, 1000, cp, 0, 1, to, 1, pa, s, similar, to, that, of, light, motor, oil, most, ultramafic, lavas, are, no, younger, than, the, proterozoic, with, a, few, ultramafic, magmas, known, from, the, phanerozoic, in, central, america, that, are, attributed, to, a, hot, mantle, plume, no, modern, komatiite, lavas, are, known, as, the, earth, s, mantle, has, cooled, too, much, to, produce, highly, magnesian, magmas, some, silicic, magmas, have, an, elevated, content, of, alkali, metal, oxides, sodium, and, potassium, particularly, in, regions, of, continental, rifting, areas, overlying, deeply, subducted, plates, or, at, intraplate, hotspots, their, silica, content, can, range, from, ultramafic, nephelinites, basanites, and, tephrites, to, felsic, trachytes, they, are, more, likely, to, be, generated, at, greater, depths, in, the, mantle, than, subalkaline, magmas, olivine, nephelinite, magmas, are, both, ultramafic, and, highly, alkaline, and, are, thought, to, have, come, from, much, deeper, in, the, mantle, of, the, earth, than, other, magmas, tholeiitic, basalt, magma, rhyolite, magma, some, lavas, of, unusual, composition, have, erupted, onto, the, surface, of, the, earth, these, include, the, concentrations, of, different, gases, can, vary, considerably, water, vapor, is, typically, the, most, abundant, magmatic, gas, followed, by, carbon, dioxide, and, sulfur, dioxide, other, principal, magmatic, gases, include, hydrogen, sulfide, hydrogen, chloride, and, hydrogen, fluoride, the, solubility, of, magmatic, gases, in, magma, depends, on, pressure, magma, composition, and, temperature, magma, that, is, extruded, as, lava, is, extremely, dry, but, magma, at, depth, and, under, great, pressure, can, contain, a, dissolved, water, content, in, excess, of, 10, water, is, somewhat, less, soluble, in, low, silica, magma, than, high, silica, magma, so, that, at, 1, 100, c, and, 0, 5, gpa, a, basaltic, magma, can, dissolve, 8, h, 2, o, while, a, granite, pegmatite, magma, can, dissolve, 11, h, 2, o, however, magmas, are, not, necessarily, saturated, under, typical, conditions, carbon, dioxide, is, much, less, soluble, in, magmas, than, water, and, frequently, separates, into, a, distinct, fluid, phase, even, at, great, depth, this, explains, the, presence, of, carbon, dioxide, fluid, inclusions, in, crystals, formed, in, magmas, at, great, depth, viscosity, is, a, key, melt, property, in, understanding, the, behaviour, of, magmas, whereas, temperatures, in, common, silicate, lavas, range, from, about, 800, c, 1, 470, f, for, felsic, lavas, to, 1, 200, c, 2, 190, f, for, mafic, lavas, the, viscosity, of, the, same, lavas, ranges, over, seven, orders, of, magnitude, from, 10, 4, cp, 10, pa, s, for, mafic, lava, to, 10, 11, cp, 10, 8, pa, s, for, felsic, magmas, the, viscosity, is, mostly, determined, by, composition, but, is, also, dependent, on, temperature, the, tendency, of, felsic, lava, to, be, cooler, than, mafic, lava, increases, the, viscosity, difference, the, silicon, ion, is, small, and, highly, charged, and, so, it, has, a, strong, tendency, to, coordinate, with, four, oxygen, ions, which, form, a, tetrahedral, arrangement, around, the, much, smaller, silicon, ion, this, is, called, a, silica, tetrahedron, in, a, magma, that, is, low, in, silicon, these, silica, tetrahedra, are, isolated, but, as, the, silicon, content, increases, silica, tetrahedra, begin, to, partially, polymerize, forming, chains, sheets, and, clumps, of, silica, tetrahedra, linked, by, bridging, oxygen, ions, these, greatly, increase, the, viscosity, of, the, magma, the, tendency, towards, polymerization, is, expressed, as, nbo, t, where, nbo, is, the, number, of, non, bridging, oxygen, ions, and, t, is, the, number, of, network, forming, ions, silicon, is, the, main, network, forming, ion, but, in, magmas, high, in, sodium, aluminium, also, acts, as, a, network, former, and, ferric, iron, can, act, as, a, network, former, when, other, network, formers, are, lacking, most, other, metallic, ions, reduce, the, tendency, to, polymerize, and, are, described, as, network, modifiers, in, a, hypothetical, magma, formed, entirely, from, melted, silica, nbo, t, would, be, 0, while, in, a, hypothetical, magma, so, low, in, network, formers, that, no, polymerization, takes, place, nbo, t, would, be, 4, neither, extreme, is, common, in, nature, but, basalt, magmas, typically, have, nbo, t, between, 0, 6, and, 0, 9, andesitic, magmas, have, nbo, t, of, 0, 3, to, 0, 5, and, rhyolitic, magmas, have, nbo, t, of, 0, 02, to, 0, 2, water, acts, as, a, network, modifier, and, dissolved, water, drastically, reduces, melt, viscosity, carbon, dioxide, neutralizes, network, modifiers, so, dissolved, carbon, dioxide, increases, the, viscosity, higher, temperature, melts, are, less, viscous, since, more, thermal, energy, is, available, to, break, bonds, between, oxygen, and, network, formers, most, magmas, contain, solid, crystals, of, various, minerals, fragments, of, exotic, rocks, known, as, xenoliths, and, fragments, of, previously, solidified, magma, the, crystal, content, of, most, magmas, gives, them, thixotropic, and, shear, thinning, properties, in, other, words, most, magmas, do, not, behave, like, newtonian, fluids, in, which, the, rate, of, flow, is, proportional, to, the, shear, stress, instead, a, typical, magma, is, a, bingham, fluid, which, shows, considerable, resistance, to, flow, until, a, stress, threshold, called, the, yield, stress, is, crossed, this, results, in, plug, flow, of, partially, crystalline, magma, a, familiar, example, of, plug, flow, is, toothpaste, squeezed, out, of, a, toothpaste, tube, the, toothpaste, comes, out, as, a, semisolid, plug, because, shear, is, concentrated, in, a, thin, layer, in, the, toothpaste, next, to, the, tube, and, only, here, does, the, toothpaste, behave, as, a, fluid, thixotropic, behavior, also, hinders, crystals, from, settling, out, of, the, magma, once, the, crystal, content, reaches, about, 60, the, magma, ceases, to, behave, like, a, fluid, and, begins, to, behave, like, a, solid, such, a, mixture, of, crystals, with, melted, rock, is, sometimes, described, as, crystal, mush, magma, is, typically, also, viscoelastic, meaning, it, flows, like, a, liquid, under, low, stresses, but, once, the, applied, stress, exceeds, a, critical, value, the, melt, cannot, dissipate, the, stress, fast, enough, through, relaxation, alone, resulting, in, transient, fracture, propagation, once, stresses, are, reduced, below, the, critical, threshold, the, melt, viscously, relaxes, once, more, and, heals, the, fracture, temperatures, of, molten, lava, which, is, magma, extruded, onto, the, surface, are, almost, all, in, the, range, 700, to, 1, 400, c, 1, 300, to, 2, 600, f, but, very, rare, carbonatite, magmas, may, be, as, cool, as, 490, c, 910, f, and, komatiite, magmas, may, have, been, as, hot, as, 1, 600, c, 2, 900, f, magma, has, occasionally, been, encountered, during, drilling, in, geothermal, fields, including, drilling, in, hawaii, that, penetrated, a, dacitic, magma, body, at, a, depth, of, 2, 488, m, 8, 163, ft, the, temperature, of, this, magma, was, estimated, at, 1, 050, c, 1, 920, f, temperatures, of, deeper, magmas, must, be, inferred, from, theoretical, computations, and, the, geothermal, gradient, most, magmas, contain, some, solid, crystals, suspended, in, the, liquid, phase, this, indicates, that, the, temperature, of, the, magma, lies, between, the, solidus, which, is, defined, as, the, temperature, at, which, the, magma, completely, solidifies, and, the, liquidus, defined, as, the, temperature, at, which, the, magma, is, completely, liquid, calculations, of, solidus, temperatures, at, likely, depths, suggests, that, magma, generated, beneath, areas, of, rifting, starts, at, a, temperature, of, about, 1, 300, to, 1, 500, c, 2, 400, to, 2, 700, f, magma, generated, from, mantle, plumes, may, be, as, hot, as, 1, 600, c, 2, 900, f, the, temperature, of, magma, generated, in, subduction, zones, where, water, vapor, lowers, the, melting, temperature, may, be, as, low, as, 1, 060, c, 1, 940, f, magma, densities, depend, mostly, on, composition, iron, content, being, the, most, important, parameter, magma, expands, slightly, at, lower, pressure, or, higher, temperature, when, magma, approaches, the, surface, its, dissolved, gases, begin, to, bubble, out, of, the, liquid, these, bubbles, had, significantly, reduced, the, density, of, the, magma, at, depth, and, helped, drive, it, toward, the, surface, in, the, first, place, the, temperature, within, the, interior, of, the, earth, is, described, by, the, geothermal, gradient, which, is, the, rate, of, temperature, change, with, depth, the, geothermal, gradient, is, established, by, the, balance, between, heating, through, radioactive, decay, in, the, earth, s, interior, and, heat, loss, from, the, surface, of, the, earth, the, geothermal, gradient, averages, about, 25, c, km, in, the, earth, s, upper, crust, but, this, varies, widely, by, region, from, a, low, of, 5, 10, c, km, within, oceanic, trenches, and, subduction, zones, to, 30, 80, c, km, along, mid, ocean, ridges, or, near, mantle, plumes, the, gradient, becomes, less, steep, with, depth, dropping, to, just, 0, 25, to, 0, 3, c, km, in, the, mantle, where, slow, convection, efficiently, transports, heat, the, average, geothermal, gradient, is, not, normally, steep, enough, to, bring, rocks, to, their, melting, point, anywhere, in, the, crust, or, upper, mantle, so, magma, is, produced, only, where, the, geothermal, gradient, is, unusually, steep, or, the, melting, point, of, the, rock, is, unusually, low, however, the, ascent, of, magma, towards, the, surface, in, such, settings, is, the, most, important, process, for, transporting, heat, through, the, crust, of, the, earth, rocks, may, melt, in, response, to, a, decrease, in, pressure, to, a, change, in, composition, such, as, an, addition, of, water, to, an, increase, in, temperature, or, to, a, combination, of, these, processes, other, mechanisms, such, as, melting, from, a, meteorite, impact, are, less, important, today, but, impacts, during, the, accretion, of, the, earth, led, to, extensive, melting, and, the, outer, several, hundred, kilometers, of, the, early, earth, was, probably, a, magma, ocean, impacts, of, large, meteorites, in, the, last, few, hundred, million, years, have, been, proposed, as, one, mechanism, responsible, for, the, extensive, basalt, magmatism, of, several, large, igneous, provinces, decompression, melting, occurs, because, of, a, decrease, in, pressure, it, is, the, most, important, mechanism, for, producing, magma, from, the, upper, mantle, the, solidus, temperatures, of, most, rocks, the, temperatures, below, which, they, are, completely, solid, increase, with, increasing, pressure, in, the, absence, of, water, peridotite, at, depth, in, the, earth, s, mantle, may, be, hotter, than, its, solidus, temperature, at, some, shallower, level, if, such, rock, rises, during, the, convection, of, solid, mantle, it, will, cool, slightly, as, it, expands, in, an, adiabatic, process, but, the, cooling, is, only, about, 0, 3, c, per, kilometer, experimental, studies, of, appropriate, peridotite, samples, document, that, the, solidus, temperatures, increase, by, 3, c, to, 4, c, per, kilometer, if, the, rock, rises, far, enough, it, will, begin, to, melt, melt, droplets, can, coalesce, into, larger, volumes, and, be, intruded, upwards, this, process, of, melting, from, the, upward, movement, of, solid, mantle, is, critical, in, the, evolution, of, the, earth, decompression, melting, creates, the, ocean, crust, at, mid, ocean, ridges, making, it, by, far, the, most, important, source, of, magma, on, earth, it, also, causes, volcanism, in, intraplate, regions, such, as, europe, africa, and, the, pacific, sea, floor, intraplate, volcanism, is, attributed, to, the, rise, of, mantle, plumes, or, to, intraplate, extension, with, the, importance, of, each, mechanism, being, a, topic, of, continuing, research, the, change, of, rock, composition, most, responsible, for, the, creation, of, magma, is, the, addition, of, water, water, lowers, the, solidus, temperature, of, rocks, at, a, given, pressure, for, example, at, a, depth, of, about, 100, kilometers, peridotite, begins, to, melt, near, 800, c, in, the, presence, of, excess, water, but, near, 1, 500, c, in, the, absence, of, water, water, is, driven, out, of, the, oceanic, lithosphere, in, subduction, zones, and, it, causes, melting, in, the, overlying, mantle, hydrous, magmas, with, the, composition, of, basalt, or, andesite, are, produced, directly, and, indirectly, as, results, of, dehydration, during, the, subduction, process, such, magmas, and, those, derived, from, them, build, up, island, arcs, such, as, those, in, the, pacific, ring, of, fire, these, magmas, form, rocks, of, the, calc, alkaline, series, an, important, part, of, the, continental, crust, with, low, density, and, viscosity, hydrous, magmas, are, highly, buoyant, and, will, move, upwards, in, earth, s, mantle, the, addition, of, carbon, dioxide, is, relatively, a, much, less, important, cause, of, magma, formation, than, the, addition, of, water, but, genesis, of, some, silica, undersaturated, magmas, has, been, attributed, to, the, dominance, of, carbon, dioxide, over, water, in, their, mantle, source, regions, in, the, presence, of, carbon, dioxide, experiments, document, that, the, peridotite, solidus, temperature, decreases, by, about, 200, c, in, a, narrow, pressure, interval, at, pressures, corresponding, to, a, depth, of, about, 70, km, at, greater, depths, carbon, dioxide, can, have, more, effect, at, depths, to, about, 200, km, the, temperatures, of, initial, melting, of, a, carbonated, peridotite, composition, were, determined, to, be, 450, c, to, 600, c, lower, than, for, the, same, composition, with, no, carbon, dioxide, magmas, of, rock, types, such, as, nephelinite, carbonatite, and, kimberlite, are, among, those, that, may, be, generated, following, an, influx, of, carbon, dioxide, into, mantle, at, depths, greater, than, about, 70, km, increase, in, temperature, is, the, most, typical, mechanism, for, formation, of, magma, within, continental, crust, such, temperature, increases, can, occur, because, of, the, upward, intrusion, of, magma, from, the, mantle, temperatures, can, also, exceed, the, solidus, of, a, crustal, rock, in, continental, crust, thickened, by, compression, at, a, plate, boundary, the, plate, boundary, between, the, indian, and, asian, continental, masses, provides, a, well, studied, example, as, the, tibetan, plateau, just, north, of, the, boundary, has, crust, about, 80, kilometers, thick, roughly, twice, the, thickness, of, normal, continental, crust, studies, of, electrical, resistivity, deduced, from, magnetotelluric, data, have, detected, a, layer, that, appears, to, contain, silicate, melt, and, that, stretches, for, at, least, 1, 000, kilometers, within, the, middle, crust, along, the, southern, margin, of, the, tibetan, plateau, granite, and, rhyolite, are, types, of, igneous, rock, commonly, interpreted, as, products, of, the, melting, of, continental, crust, because, of, increases, in, temperature, temperature, increases, also, may, contribute, to, the, melting, of, lithosphere, dragged, down, in, a, subduction, zone, when, rocks, melt, they, do, so, over, a, range, of, temperature, because, most, rocks, are, made, of, several, minerals, which, all, have, different, melting, points, the, temperature, at, which, the, first, melt, appears, the, solidus, is, lower, than, the, melting, temperature, of, any, one, of, the, pure, minerals, this, is, similar, to, the, lowering, of, the, melting, point, of, ice, when, it, is, mixed, with, salt, the, first, melt, is, called, the, eutectic, and, has, a, composition, that, depends, on, the, combination, of, minerals, present, for, example, a, mixture, of, anorthite, and, diopside, which, are, two, of, the, predominant, minerals, in, basalt, begins, to, melt, at, about, 1274, c, this, is, well, below, the, melting, temperatures, of, 1392, c, for, pure, diopside, and, 1553, c, for, pure, anorthite, the, resulting, melt, is, composed, of, about, 43, wt, anorthite, as, additional, heat, is, added, to, the, rock, the, temperature, remains, at, 1274, c, until, either, the, anorthite, or, diopside, is, fully, melted, the, temperature, then, rises, as, the, remaining, mineral, continues, to, melt, which, shifts, the, melt, composition, away, from, the, eutectic, for, example, if, the, content, of, anorthite, is, greater, than, 43, the, entire, supply, of, diopside, will, melt, at, 1274, c, along, with, enough, of, the, anorthite, to, keep, the, melt, at, the, eutectic, composition, further, heating, causes, the, temperature, to, slowly, rise, as, the, remaining, anorthite, gradually, melts, and, the, melt, becomes, increasingly, rich, in, anorthite, liquid, if, the, mixture, has, only, a, slight, excess, of, anorthite, this, will, melt, before, the, temperature, rises, much, above, 1274, c, if, the, mixture, is, almost, all, anorthite, the, temperature, will, reach, nearly, the, melting, point, of, pure, anorthite, before, all, the, anorthite, is, melted, if, the, anorthite, content, of, the, mixture, is, less, than, 43, then, all, the, anorthite, will, melt, at, the, eutectic, temperature, along, with, part, of, the, diopside, and, the, remaining, diopside, will, then, gradually, melt, as, the, temperature, continues, to, rise, because, of, eutectic, melting, the, composition, of, the, melt, can, be, quite, different, from, the, source, rock, for, example, a, mixture, of, 10, anorthite, with, diopside, could, experience, about, 23, partial, melting, before, the, melt, deviated, from, the, eutectic, which, has, the, composition, of, about, 43, anorthite, this, effect, of, partial, melting, is, reflected, in, the, compositions, of, different, magmas, a, low, degree, of, partial, melting, of, the, upper, mantle, 2, to, 4, can, produce, highly, alkaline, magmas, such, as, melilitites, while, a, greater, degree, of, partial, melting, 8, to, 11, can, produce, alkali, olivine, basalt, oceanic, magmas, likely, result, from, partial, melting, of, 3, to, 15, of, the, source, rock, some, calk, alkaline, granitoids, may, be, produced, by, a, high, degree, of, partial, melting, as, much, as, 15, to, 30, high, magnesium, magmas, such, as, komatiite, and, picrite, may, also, be, the, products, of, a, high, degree, of, partial, melting, of, mantle, rock, certain, chemical, elements, called, incompatible, elements, have, a, combination, of, ionic, radius, and, ionic, charge, that, is, unlike, that, of, the, more, abundant, elements, in, the, source, rock, the, ions, of, these, elements, fit, rather, poorly, in, the, structure, of, the, minerals, making, up, the, source, rock, and, readily, leave, the, solid, minerals, to, become, highly, concentrated, in, melts, produced, by, a, low, degree, of, partial, melting, incompatible, elements, commonly, include, potassium, barium, caesium, and, rubidium, which, are, large, and, weakly, charged, the, large, ion, lithophile, elements, or, liles, as, well, as, elements, whose, ions, carry, a, high, charge, the, high, field, strength, elements, or, hsfes, which, include, such, elements, as, zirconium, niobium, hafnium, tantalum, the, rare, earth, elements, and, the, actinides, potassium, can, become, so, enriched, in, melt, produced, by, a, very, low, degree, of, partial, melting, that, when, the, magma, subsequently, cools, and, solidifies, it, forms, unusual, potassic, rock, such, as, lamprophyre, lamproite, or, kimberlite, when, enough, rock, is, melted, the, small, globules, of, melt, generally, occurring, between, mineral, grains, link, up, and, soften, the, rock, under, pressure, within, the, earth, as, little, as, a, fraction, of, a, percent, of, partial, melting, may, be, sufficient, to, cause, melt, to, be, squeezed, from, its, source, melt, rapidly, separates, from, its, source, rock, once, the, degree, of, partial, melting, exceeds, 30, however, usually, much, less, than, 30, of, a, magma, source, rock, is, melted, before, the, heat, supply, is, exhausted, pegmatite, may, be, produced, by, low, degrees, of, partial, melting, of, the, crust, some, granite, composition, magmas, are, eutectic, or, cotectic, melts, and, they, may, be, produced, by, low, to, high, degrees, of, partial, melting, of, the, crust, as, well, as, by, fractional, crystallization, most, magmas, are, fully, melted, only, for, small, parts, of, their, histories, more, typically, they, are, mixes, of, melt, and, crystals, and, sometimes, also, of, gas, bubbles, melt, crystals, and, bubbles, usually, have, different, densities, and, so, they, can, separate, as, magmas, evolve, as, magma, cools, minerals, typically, crystallize, from, the, melt, at, different, temperatures, this, resembles, the, original, melting, process, in, reverse, however, because, the, melt, has, usually, separated, from, its, original, source, rock, and, moved, to, a, shallower, depth, the, reverse, process, of, crystallization, is, not, precisely, identical, for, example, if, a, melt, was, 50, each, of, diopside, and, anorthite, then, anorthite, would, begin, crystallizing, from, the, melt, at, a, temperature, somewhat, higher, than, the, eutectic, temperature, of, 1274, c, this, shifts, the, remaining, melt, towards, its, eutectic, composition, of, 43, diopside, the, eutectic, is, reached, at, 1274, c, the, temperature, at, which, diopside, and, anorthite, begin, crystallizing, together, if, the, melt, was, 90, diopside, the, diopside, would, begin, crystallizing, first, until, the, eutectic, was, reached, if, the, crystals, remained, suspended, in, the, melt, the, crystallization, process, would, not, change, the, overall, composition, of, the, melt, plus, solid, minerals, this, situation, is, described, as, equillibrium, crystallization, however, in, a, series, of, experiments, culminating, in, his, 1915, paper, crystallization, differentiation, in, silicate, liquids, norman, l, bowen, demonstrated, that, crystals, of, olivine, and, diopside, that, crystallized, out, of, a, cooling, melt, of, forsterite, diopside, and, silica, would, sink, through, the, melt, on, geologically, relevant, time, scales, geologists, subsequently, found, considerable, field, evidence, of, such, fractional, crystallization, when, crystals, separate, from, a, magma, then, the, residual, magma, will, differ, in, composition, from, the, parent, magma, for, instance, a, magma, of, gabbroic, composition, can, produce, a, residual, melt, of, granitic, composition, if, early, formed, crystals, are, separated, from, the, magma, gabbro, may, have, a, liquidus, temperature, near, 1, 200, c, and, the, derivative, granite, composition, melt, may, have, a, liquidus, temperature, as, low, as, about, 700, c, incompatible, elements, are, concentrated, in, the, last, residues, of, magma, during, fractional, crystallization, and, in, the, first, melts, produced, during, partial, melting, either, process, can, form, the, magma, that, crystallizes, to, pegmatite, a, rock, type, commonly, enriched, in, incompatible, elements, bowen, s, reaction, series, is, important, for, understanding, the, idealised, sequence, of, fractional, crystallisation, of, a, magma, magma, composition, can, be, determined, by, processes, other, than, partial, melting, and, fractional, crystallization, for, instance, magmas, commonly, interact, with, rocks, they, intrude, both, by, melting, those, rocks, and, by, reacting, with, them, assimilation, near, the, roof, of, a, magma, chamber, and, fractional, crystallization, near, its, base, can, even, take, place, simultaneously, magmas, of, different, compositions, can, mix, with, one, another, in, rare, cases, melts, can, separate, into, two, immiscible, melts, of, contrasting, compositions, when, rock, melts, the, liquid, is, a, primary, magma, primary, magmas, have, not, undergone, any, differentiation, and, represent, the, starting, composition, of, a, magma, in, practice, it, is, difficult, to, unambiguously, identify, primary, magmas, though, it, has, been, suggested, that, boninite, is, a, variety, of, andesite, crystallized, from, a, primary, magma, the, great, dyke, of, zimbabwe, has, also, been, interpreted, as, rock, crystallized, from, a, primary, magma, the, interpretation, of, leucosomes, of, migmatites, as, primary, magmas, is, contradicted, by, zircon, data, which, suggests, leucosomes, are, a, residue, a, cumulate, rock, left, by, extraction, of, a, primary, magma, when, it, is, impossible, to, find, the, primitive, or, primary, magma, composition, it, is, often, useful, to, attempt, to, identify, a, parental, magma, a, parental, magma, is, a, magma, composition, from, which, the, observed, range, of, magma, chemistries, has, been, derived, by, the, processes, of, igneous, differentiation, it, need, not, be, a, primitive, melt, for, instance, a, series, of, basalt, flows, are, assumed, to, be, related, to, one, another, a, composition, from, which, they, could, reasonably, be, produced, by, fractional, crystallization, is, termed, a, parental, magma, fractional, crystallization, models, would, be, produced, to, test, the, hypothesis, that, they, share, a, common, parental, magma, magma, develops, within, the, mantle, or, crust, where, the, temperature, and, pressure, conditions, favor, the, molten, state, after, its, formation, magma, buoyantly, rises, toward, the, earth, s, surface, due, to, its, lower, density, than, the, source, rock, as, it, migrates, through, the, crust, magma, may, collect, and, reside, in, magma, chambers, though, recent, work, suggests, that, magma, may, be, stored, in, trans, crustal, crystal, rich, mush, zones, rather, than, dominantly, liquid, magma, chambers, magma, can, remain, in, a, chamber, until, it, either, cools, and, crystallizes, to, form, intrusive, rock, it, erupts, as, a, volcano, or, it, moves, into, another, magma, chamber, when, magma, cools, it, begins, to, form, solid, mineral, phases, some, of, these, settle, at, the, bottom, of, the, magma, chamber, forming, cumulates, that, might, form, mafic, layered, intrusions, magma, that, cools, slowly, within, a, magma, chamber, usually, ends, up, forming, bodies, of, plutonic, rocks, such, as, gabbro, diorite, and, granite, depending, upon, the, composition, of, the, magma, alternatively, if, the, magma, is, erupted, it, forms, volcanic, rocks, such, as, basalt, andesite, and, rhyolite, the, extrusive, equivalents, of, gabbro, diorite, and, granite, respectively, magma, that, is, extruded, onto, the, surface, during, a, volcanic, eruption, is, called, lava, lava, cools, and, solidifies, relatively, quickly, compared, to, underground, bodies, of, magma, this, fast, cooling, does, not, allow, crystals, to, grow, large, and, a, part, of, the, melt, does, not, crystallize, at, all, becoming, glass, rocks, largely, composed, of, volcanic, glass, include, obsidian, scoria, and, pumice, before, and, during, volcanic, eruptions, volatiles, such, as, co, 2, and, h, 2, o, partially, leave, the, melt, through, a, process, known, as, exsolution, magma, with, low, water, content, becomes, increasingly, viscous, if, massive, exsolution, occurs, when, magma, heads, upwards, during, a, volcanic, eruption, the, resulting, eruption, is, usually, explosive, the, iceland, deep, drilling, project, while, drilling, several, 5, 000, m, holes, in, an, attempt, to, harness, the, heat, in, the, volcanic, bedrock, below, the, surface, of, iceland, struck, a, pocket, of, magma, at, 2, 100, m, in, 2009, because, this, was, only, the, third, time, in, recorded, history, that, magma, had, been, reached, iddp, decided, to, invest, in, the, hole, naming, it, iddp, 1,
