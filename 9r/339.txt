legend, the, halogens, h, l, d, n, h, e, l, o, d, n, are, a, group, in, the, periodic, table, consisting, of, six, chemically, related, elements, fluorine, f, chlorine, cl, bromine, br, iodine, i, and, the, radioactive, elements, astatine, at, and, tennessine, ts, though, some, authors, would, exclude, tennessine, as, its, chemistry, is, unknown, and, is, theoretically, expected, to, be, more, like, that, of, gallium, in, the, modern, iupac, nomenclature, this, group, is, known, as, group, 17, the, word, halogen, means, salt, former, or, salt, maker, when, halogens, react, with, metals, they, produce, a, wide, range, of, salts, including, calcium, fluoride, sodium, chloride, common, table, salt, silver, bromide, and, potassium, iodide, the, group, of, halogens, is, the, only, periodic, table, group, that, contains, elements, in, three, of, the, main, states, of, matter, at, standard, temperature, and, pressure, though, not, far, above, room, temperature, the, same, becomes, true, of, groups, 1, and, 15, assuming, white, phosphorus, is, taken, as, the, standard, state, all, of, the, halogens, form, acids, when, bonded, to, hydrogen, most, halogens, are, typically, produced, from, minerals, or, salts, the, middle, halogens, chlorine, bromine, and, iodine, are, often, used, as, disinfectants, organobromides, are, the, most, important, class, of, flame, retardants, while, elemental, halogens, are, dangerous, and, can, be, toxic, the, fluorine, mineral, fluorospar, was, known, as, early, as, 1529, early, chemists, realized, that, fluorine, compounds, contain, an, undiscovered, element, but, were, unable, to, isolate, it, in, 1860, george, gore, an, english, chemist, ran, a, current, of, electricity, through, hydrofluoric, acid, and, probably, produced, fluorine, but, he, was, unable, to, prove, his, results, at, the, time, in, 1886, henri, moissan, a, chemist, in, paris, performed, electrolysis, on, potassium, bifluoride, dissolved, in, anhydrous, hydrogen, fluoride, and, successfully, isolated, fluorine, hydrochloric, acid, was, known, to, alchemists, and, early, chemists, however, elemental, chlorine, was, not, produced, until, 1774, when, carl, wilhelm, scheele, heated, hydrochloric, acid, with, manganese, dioxide, scheele, called, the, element, dephlogisticated, muriatic, acid, which, is, how, chlorine, was, known, for, 33, years, in, 1807, humphry, davy, investigated, chlorine, and, discovered, that, it, is, an, actual, element, chlorine, gas, was, used, as, a, poisonous, gas, during, world, war, i, it, displaced, oxygen, in, contaminated, areas, and, replaced, common, oxygenated, air, with, the, toxic, chlorine, gas, the, gas, would, burn, human, tissue, externally, and, internally, especially, the, lungs, making, breathing, difficult, or, impossible, depending, on, the, level, of, contamination, bromine, was, discovered, in, the, 1820s, by, antoine, j, r, me, balard, balard, discovered, bromine, by, passing, chlorine, gas, through, a, sample, of, brine, he, originally, proposed, the, name, muride, for, the, new, element, but, the, french, academy, changed, the, element, s, name, to, bromine, iodine, was, discovered, by, bernard, courtois, who, was, using, seaweed, ash, as, part, of, a, process, for, saltpeter, manufacture, courtois, typically, boiled, the, seaweed, ash, with, water, to, generate, potassium, chloride, however, in, 1811, courtois, added, sulfuric, acid, to, his, process, and, found, that, his, process, produced, purple, fumes, that, condensed, into, black, crystals, suspecting, that, these, crystals, were, a, new, element, courtois, sent, samples, to, other, chemists, for, investigation, iodine, was, proven, to, be, a, new, element, by, joseph, gay, lussac, in, 1931, fred, allison, claimed, to, have, discovered, element, 85, with, a, magneto, optical, machine, and, named, the, element, alabamine, but, was, mistaken, in, 1937, rajendralal, de, claimed, to, have, discovered, element, 85, in, minerals, and, called, the, element, dakine, but, he, was, also, mistaken, an, attempt, at, discovering, element, 85, in, 1939, by, horia, hulubei, and, yvette, cauchois, via, spectroscopy, was, also, unsuccessful, as, was, an, attempt, in, the, same, year, by, walter, minder, who, discovered, an, iodine, like, element, resulting, from, beta, decay, of, polonium, element, 85, now, named, astatine, was, produced, successfully, in, 1940, by, dale, r, corson, k, r, mackenzie, and, emilio, g, segr, who, bombarded, bismuth, with, alpha, particles, in, 2010, a, team, led, by, nuclear, physicist, yuri, oganessian, involving, scientists, from, the, jinr, oak, ridge, national, laboratory, lawrence, livermore, national, laboratory, and, vanderbilt, university, successfully, bombarded, berkelium, 249, atoms, with, calcium, 48, atoms, to, make, tennessine, in, 1811, the, german, chemist, johann, schweigger, proposed, that, the, name, halogen, meaning, salt, producer, from, salt, and, to, beget, replace, the, name, chlorine, which, had, been, proposed, by, the, english, chemist, humphry, davy, davy, s, name, for, the, element, prevailed, however, in, 1826, the, swedish, chemist, baron, j, ns, jacob, berzelius, proposed, the, term, halogen, for, the, elements, fluorine, chlorine, and, iodine, which, produce, a, sea, salt, like, substance, when, they, form, a, compound, with, an, alkaline, metal, the, english, names, of, these, elements, all, have, the, ending, ine, fluorine, s, name, comes, from, the, latin, word, fluere, meaning, to, flow, because, it, was, derived, from, the, mineral, fluorite, which, was, used, as, a, flux, in, metalworking, chlorine, s, name, comes, from, the, greek, word, chloros, meaning, greenish, yellow, bromine, s, name, comes, from, the, greek, word, bromos, meaning, stench, iodine, s, name, comes, from, the, greek, word, iodes, meaning, violet, astatine, s, name, comes, from, the, greek, word, astatos, meaning, unstable, tennessine, is, named, after, the, us, state, of, tennessee, where, it, was, synthesized, the, halogens, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and, iodine, are, nonmetals, the, chemical, properties, of, the, two, heaviest, group, 17, members, have, not, been, conclusively, investigated, the, halogens, show, trends, in, chemical, bond, energy, moving, from, top, to, bottom, of, the, periodic, table, column, with, fluorine, deviating, slightly, it, follows, a, trend, in, having, the, highest, bond, energy, in, compounds, with, other, atoms, but, it, has, very, weak, bonds, within, the, diatomic, f, 2, molecule, this, means, that, further, down, group, 17, in, the, periodic, table, the, reactivity, of, elements, decreases, because, of, the, increasing, size, of, the, atoms, halogens, are, highly, reactive, and, as, such, can, be, harmful, or, lethal, to, biological, organisms, in, sufficient, quantities, this, high, reactivity, is, due, to, the, high, electronegativity, of, the, atoms, due, to, their, high, effective, nuclear, charge, because, the, halogens, have, seven, valence, electrons, in, their, outermost, energy, level, they, can, gain, an, electron, by, reacting, with, atoms, of, other, elements, to, satisfy, the, octet, rule, fluorine, is, the, most, reactive, of, all, elements, it, is, the, only, element, more, electronegative, than, oxygen, it, attacks, otherwise, inert, materials, such, as, glass, and, it, forms, compounds, with, the, usually, inert, noble, gases, it, is, a, corrosive, and, highly, toxic, gas, the, reactivity, of, fluorine, is, such, that, if, used, or, stored, in, laboratory, glassware, it, can, react, with, glass, in, the, presence, of, small, amounts, of, water, to, form, silicon, tetrafluoride, sif, 4, thus, fluorine, must, be, handled, with, substances, such, as, teflon, which, is, itself, an, organofluorine, compound, extremely, dry, glass, or, metals, such, as, copper, or, steel, which, form, a, protective, layer, of, fluoride, on, their, surface, the, high, reactivity, of, fluorine, allows, some, of, the, strongest, bonds, possible, especially, to, carbon, for, example, teflon, is, fluorine, bonded, with, carbon, and, is, extremely, resistant, to, thermal, and, chemical, attacks, and, has, a, high, melting, point, the, stable, halogens, form, homonuclear, diatomic, molecules, due, to, relatively, weak, intermolecular, forces, chlorine, and, fluorine, form, part, of, the, group, known, as, elemental, gases, the, elements, become, less, reactive, and, have, higher, melting, points, as, the, atomic, number, increases, the, higher, melting, points, are, caused, by, stronger, london, dispersion, forces, resulting, from, more, electrons, all, of, the, halogens, have, been, observed, to, react, with, hydrogen, to, form, hydrogen, halides, for, fluorine, chlorine, and, bromine, this, reaction, is, in, the, form, of, however, hydrogen, iodide, and, hydrogen, astatide, can, split, back, into, their, constituent, elements, the, hydrogen, halogen, reactions, get, gradually, less, reactive, toward, the, heavier, halogens, a, fluorine, hydrogen, reaction, is, explosive, even, when, it, is, dark, and, cold, a, chlorine, hydrogen, reaction, is, also, explosive, but, only, in, the, presence, of, light, and, heat, a, bromine, hydrogen, reaction, is, even, less, explosive, it, is, explosive, only, when, exposed, to, flames, iodine, and, astatine, only, partially, react, with, hydrogen, forming, equilibria, all, halogens, form, binary, compounds, with, hydrogen, known, as, the, hydrogen, halides, hydrogen, fluoride, hf, hydrogen, chloride, hcl, hydrogen, bromide, hbr, hydrogen, iodide, hi, and, hydrogen, astatide, hat, all, of, these, compounds, form, acids, when, mixed, with, water, hydrogen, fluoride, is, the, only, hydrogen, halide, that, forms, hydrogen, bonds, hydrochloric, acid, hydrobromic, acid, hydroiodic, acid, and, hydroastatic, acid, are, all, strong, acids, but, hydrofluoric, acid, is, a, weak, acid, all, of, the, hydrogen, halides, are, irritants, hydrogen, fluoride, and, hydrogen, chloride, are, highly, acidic, hydrogen, fluoride, is, used, as, an, indu, strial, chemical, and, is, highly, toxic, causing, pulmonary, edema, and, damaging, cells, hydrogen, chloride, is, also, a, dangerous, chemical, breathing, in, gas, with, more, than, fifty, parts, per, million, of, hydrogen, chloride, can, cause, death, in, humans, hydrogen, bromide, is, even, more, toxic, and, irritating, than, hydrogen, chloride, breathing, in, gas, with, more, than, thirty, parts, per, million, of, hydrogen, bromide, can, be, lethal, to, humans, hydrogen, iodide, like, other, hydrogen, halides, is, toxic, all, the, halogens, are, known, to, react, with, sodium, to, form, sodium, fluoride, sodium, chloride, sodium, bromide, sodium, iodide, and, sodium, astatide, heated, sodium, s, reaction, with, halogens, produces, bright, orange, flames, sodium, s, reaction, with, chlorine, is, in, the, form, of, iron, reacts, with, fluorine, chlorine, and, bromine, to, form, iron, iii, halides, these, reactions, are, in, the, form, of, however, when, iron, reacts, with, iodine, it, forms, only, iron, ii, iodide, iron, wool, can, react, rapidly, with, fluorine, to, form, the, white, compound, iron, iii, fluoride, even, in, cold, temperatures, when, chlorine, comes, into, contact, with, a, heated, iron, they, react, to, form, the, black, iron, iii, chloride, however, if, the, reaction, conditions, are, moist, this, reaction, will, instead, result, in, a, reddish, brown, product, iron, can, also, react, with, bromine, to, form, iron, iii, bromide, this, compound, is, reddish, brown, in, dry, conditions, iron, s, reaction, with, bromine, is, less, reactive, than, its, reaction, with, fluorine, or, chlorine, a, hot, iron, can, also, react, with, iodine, but, it, forms, iron, ii, iodide, this, compound, may, be, gray, but, the, reaction, is, always, contaminated, with, excess, iodine, so, it, is, not, known, for, sure, iron, s, reaction, with, iodine, is, less, vigorous, than, its, reaction, with, the, lighter, halogens, interhalogen, compounds, are, in, the, form, of, xy, n, where, x, and, y, are, halogens, and, n, is, one, three, five, or, seven, interhalogen, compounds, contain, at, most, two, different, halogens, large, interhalogens, such, as, clf, 3, can, be, produced, by, a, reaction, of, a, pure, halogen, with, a, smaller, interhalogen, such, as, clf, all, interhalogens, except, if, 7, can, be, produced, by, directly, combining, pure, halogens, in, various, conditions, interhalogens, are, typically, more, reactive, than, all, diatomic, halogen, molecules, except, f, 2, because, interhalogen, bonds, are, weaker, however, the, chemical, properties, of, interhalogens, are, still, roughly, the, same, as, those, of, diatomic, halogens, many, interhalogens, consist, of, one, or, more, atoms, of, fluorine, bonding, to, a, heavier, halogen, chlorine, and, bromine, can, bond, with, up, to, five, fluorine, atoms, and, iodine, can, bond, with, up, to, seven, fluorine, atoms, most, interhalogen, compounds, are, covalent, gases, however, some, interhalogens, are, liquids, such, as, brf, 3, and, many, iodine, containing, interhalogens, are, solids, many, synthetic, organic, compounds, such, as, plastic, polymers, and, a, few, natural, ones, contain, halogen, atoms, these, are, known, as, halogenated, compounds, or, organic, halides, chlorine, is, by, far, the, most, abundant, of, the, halogens, in, seawater, and, the, only, one, needed, in, relatively, large, amounts, as, chloride, ions, by, humans, for, example, chloride, ions, play, a, key, role, in, brain, function, by, mediating, the, action, of, the, inhibitory, transmitter, gaba, and, are, also, used, by, the, body, to, produce, stomach, acid, iodine, is, needed, in, trace, amounts, for, the, production, of, thyroid, hormones, such, as, thyroxine, organohalogens, are, also, synthesized, through, the, nucleophilic, abstraction, reaction, polyhalogenated, compounds, are, industrially, created, compounds, substituted, with, multiple, halogens, many, of, them, are, very, toxic, and, bioaccumulate, in, humans, and, have, a, very, wide, application, range, they, include, pcbs, pbdes, and, perfluorinated, compounds, pfcs, as, well, as, numerous, other, compounds, fluorine, reacts, vigorously, with, water, to, produce, oxygen, o, 2, and, hydrogen, fluoride, hf, chlorine, has, maximum, solubility, of, ca, 7, 1, g, cl, 2, per, kg, of, water, at, ambient, temperature, 21, c, dissolved, chlorine, reacts, to, form, hydrochloric, acid, hcl, and, hypochlorous, acid, a, solution, that, can, be, used, as, a, disinfectant, or, bleach, bromine, has, a, solubility, of, 3, 41, g, per, 100, g, of, water, but, it, slowly, reacts, to, form, hydrogen, bromide, hbr, and, hypobromous, acid, hbro, iodine, however, is, minimally, soluble, in, water, 0, 03, g, 100, g, water, at, 20, c, and, does, not, react, with, it, however, iodine, will, form, an, aqueous, solution, in, the, presence, of, iodide, ion, such, as, by, addition, of, potassium, iodide, ki, because, the, triiodide, ion, is, formed, the, table, below, is, a, summary, of, the, key, physical, and, atomic, properties, of, the, halogens, data, marked, with, question, marks, are, either, uncertain, or, are, estimations, partially, based, on, periodic, trends, rather, than, observations, fluorine, has, one, stable, and, naturally, occurring, isotope, fluorine, 19, however, there, are, trace, amounts, in, nature, of, the, radioactive, isotope, fluorine, 23, which, occurs, via, cluster, decay, of, protactinium, 231, a, total, of, eighteen, isotopes, of, fluorine, have, been, discovered, with, atomic, masses, ranging, from, 13, to, 31, chlorine, has, two, stable, and, naturally, occurring,

total, of, 33, isotopes, of, bromine, have, been, discovered, with, atomic, masses, ranging, from, 66, to, 98, there, is, one, stable, and, naturally, occurring, isotope, of, iodine, iodine, 127, however, there, are, trace, amounts, in, nature, of, the, radioactive, isotope, iodine, 129, which, occurs, via, spallation, and, from, the, radioactive, decay, of, uranium, in, ores, several, other, radioactive, isotopes, of, iodine, have, also, been, created, naturally, via, the, decay, of, uranium, a, total, of, 38, isotopes, of, iodine, have, been, discovered, with, atomic, masses, ranging, from, 108, to, 145, there, are, no, stable, isotopes, of, astatine, however, there, are, four, naturally, occurring, radioactive, isotopes, of, astatine, produced, via, radioactive, decay, of, uranium, neptunium, and, plutonium, these, isotopes, are, astatine, 215, astatine, 217, astatine, 218, and, astatine, 219, a, total, of, 31, isotopes, of, astatine, have, been, discovered, with, atomic, masses, ranging, from, 191, to, 227, there, are, no, stable, isotopes, of, tennessine, tennessine, has, only, two, known, synthetic, radioisotopes, tennessine, 293, and, tennessine, 294, approximately, six, million, metric, tons, of, the, fluorine, mineral, fluorite, are, produced, each, year, four, hundred, thousand, metric, tons, of, hydrofluoric, acid, are, made, each, year, fluorine, gas, is, made, from, hydrofluoric, acid, produced, as, a, by, product, in, phosphoric, acid, manufacture, approximately, 15, 000, metric, tons, of, fluorine, gas, are, made, per, year, the, mineral, halite, is, the, mineral, that, is, most, commonly, mined, for, chlorine, but, the, minerals, carnallite, and, sylvite, are, also, mined, for, chlorine, forty, million, metric, tons, of, chlorine, are, produced, each, year, by, the, electrolysis, of, brine, approximately, 450, 000, metric, tons, of, bromine, are, produced, each, year, fifty, percent, of, all, bromine, produced, is, produced, in, the, united, states, 35, in, israel, and, most, of, the, remainder, in, china, historically, bromine, was, produced, by, adding, sulfuric, acid, and, bleaching, powder, to, natural, brine, however, in, modern, times, bromine, is, produced, by, electrolysis, a, method, invented, by, herbert, dow, it, is, also, possible, to, produce, bromine, by, passing, chlorine, through, seawater, and, then, passing, air, through, the, seawater, in, 2003, 22, 000, metric, tons, of, iodine, were, produced, chile, produces, 40, of, all, iodine, produced, japan, produces, 30, and, smaller, amounts, are, produced, in, russia, and, the, united, states, until, the, 1950s, iodine, was, extracted, from, kelp, however, in, modern, times, iodine, is, produced, in, other, ways, one, way, that, iodine, is, produced, is, by, mixing, sulfur, dioxide, with, nitrate, ores, which, contain, some, iodates, iodine, is, also, extracted, from, natural, gas, fields, even, though, astatine, is, naturally, occurring, it, is, usually, produced, by, bombarding, bismuth, with, alpha, particles, tennessine, is, made, by, using, a, cyclotron, fusing, berkelium, 249, and, calcium, 48, to, make, tennessine, 293, and, tennessine, 294, both, chlorine, and, bromine, are, used, as, disinfectants, for, drinking, water, swimming, pools, fresh, wounds, spas, dishes, and, surfaces, they, kill, bacteria, and, other, potentially, harmful, microorganisms, through, a, process, known, as, sterilization, their, reactivity, is, also, put, to, use, in, bleaching, sodium, hypochlorite, which, is, produced, from, chlorine, is, the, active, ingredient, of, most, fabric, bleaches, and, chlorine, derived, bleaches, are, used, in, the, production, of, some, paper, products, halogen, lamps, are, a, type, of, incandescent, lamp, using, a, tungsten, filament, in, bulbs, that, have, small, amounts, of, a, halogen, such, as, iodine, or, bromine, added, this, enables, the, production, of, lamps, that, are, much, smaller, than, non, halogen, incandescent, lightbulbs, at, the, same, wattage, the, gas, reduces, the, thinning, of, the, filament, and, blackening, of, the, inside, of, the, bulb, resulting, in, a, bulb, that, has, a, much, greater, life, halogen, lamps, glow, at, a, higher, temperature, 2800, to, 3400, kelvin, with, a, whiter, colour, than, other, incandescent, bulbs, however, this, requires, bulbs, to, be, manufactured, from, fused, quartz, rather, than, silica, glass, to, reduce, breakage, in, drug, discovery, the, incorporation, of, halogen, atoms, into, a, lead, drug, candidate, results, in, analogues, that, are, usually, more, lipophilic, and, less, water, soluble, as, a, consequence, halogen, atoms, are, used, to, improve, penetration, through, lipid, membranes, and, tissues, it, follows, that, there, is, a, tendency, for, some, halogenated, drugs, to, accumulate, in, adipose, tissue, the, chemical, reactivity, of, halogen, atoms, depends, on, both, their, point, of, attachment, to, the, lead, and, the, nature, of, the, halogen, aromatic, halogen, groups, are, far, less, reactive, than, aliphatic, halogen, groups, which, can, exhibit, considerable, chemical, reactivity, for, aliphatic, carbon, halogen, bonds, the, c, f, bond, is, the, strongest, and, usually, less, chemically, reactive, than, aliphatic, c, h, bonds, the, other, aliphatic, halogen, bonds, are, weaker, their, reactivity, increasing, down, the, periodic, table, they, are, usually, more, chemically, reactive, than, aliphatic, c, h, bonds, as, a, consequence, the, most, common, halogen, substitutions, are, the, less, reactive, aromatic, fluorine, and, chlorine, groups, fluoride, anions, are, found, in, ivory, bones, teeth, blood, eggs, urine, and, hair, of, organisms, fluoride, anions, in, very, small, amounts, may, be, essential, for, humans, there, are, 0, 5, milligrams, of, fluorine, per, liter, of, human, blood, human, bones, contain, 0, 2, to, 1, 2,

70, kilogram, human, some, bromine, in, the, form, of, the, bromide, anion, is, present, in, all, organisms, a, biological, role, for, bromine, in, humans, has, not, been, proven, but, some, organisms, contain, organobromine, compounds, humans, typically, consume, 1, to, 20, milligrams, of, bromine, per, day, there, are, typically, 5, parts, per, million, of, bromine, in, human, blood, 7, parts, per, million, of, bromine, in, human, bones, and, 7, parts, per, million, of, bromine, in, human, tissue, a, typical, 70, kilogram, human, contains, 260, milligrams, of, bromine, humans, typically, consume, less, than, 100, micrograms, of, iodine, per, day, iodine, deficiency, can, cause, intellectual, disability, organoiodine, compounds, occur, in, humans, in, some, of, the, glands, especially, the, thyroid, gland, as, well, as, the, stomach, epidermis, and, immune, system, foods, containing, iodine, include, cod, oysters, shrimp, herring, lobsters, sunflower, seeds, seaweed, and, mushrooms, however, iodine, is, not, known, to, have, a, biological, role, in, plants, there, are, typically, 0, 06, milligrams, per, liter, of, iodine, in, human, blood, 300, parts, per, billion, of, iodine, in, human, bones, and, 50, to, 700, parts, per, billion, of, iodine, in, human, tissue, there, are, 10, to, 20, milligrams, of, iodine, in, a, typical, 70, kilogram, human, astatine, although, very, scarce, has, been, found, in, micrograms, in, the, earth, it, has, no, known, biological, role, because, of, its, high, radioactivity, extreme, rarity, and, has, a, half, life, of, just, about, 8, hours, for, the, most, stable, isotope, tennessine, is, purely, man, made, and, has, no, other, roles, in, nature, the, halogens, tend, to, decrease, in, toxicity, towards, the, heavier, halogens, fluorine, gas, is, extremely, toxic, breathing, in, fluorine, at, a, concentration, of, 25, parts, per, million, is, potentially, lethal, hydrofluoric, acid, is, also, toxic, being, able, to, penetrate, skin, and, cause, highly, painful, burns, in, addition, fluoride, anions, are, toxic, but, not, as, toxic, as, pure, fluorine, fluoride, can, be, lethal, in, amounts, of, 5, to, 10, grams, prolonged, consumption, of, fluoride, above, concentrations, of, 1, 5, mg, l, is, associated, with, a, risk, of, dental, fluorosis, an, aesthetic, condition, of, the, teeth, at, concentrations, above, 4, mg, l, there, is, an, increased, risk, of, developing, skeletal, fluorosis, a, condition, in, which, bone, fractures, become, more, common, due, to, the, hardening, of,

the, same, time, reaping, the, benefits, people, with, levels, between, normal, levels, and, those, required, for, skeletal, fluorosis, tend, to, have, symptoms, similar, to, arthritis, chlorine, gas, is, highly, toxic, breathing, in, chlorine, at, a, concentration, of, 3, parts, per, million, can, rapidly, cause, a, toxic, reaction, breathing, in, chlorine, at, a, concentration, of, 50, parts, per, million, is, highly, dangerous, breathing, in, chlorine, at, a, concentration, of, 500, parts, per, million, for, a, few, minutes, is, lethal, in, addition, breathing, in, chlorine, gas, is, highly, painful, because, of, its, corrosive, properties, hydrochloric, acid, is, the, acid, of, chlorine, while, relatively, nontoxic, it, is, highly, corrosive, and, releases, very, irritating, and, toxic, hydrogen, chloride, gas, in, open, air, pure, bromine, is, somewhat, toxic, but, less, toxic, than, fluorine, and, chlorine, one, hundred, milligrams, of, bromine, is, lethal, bromide, anions, are, also, toxic, but, less, so, than, bromine, bromide, has, a, lethal, dose, of, 30, grams, iodine, is, somewhat, toxic, being, able, to, irritate, the, lungs, and, eyes, with, a, safety, limit, of, 1, milligram, per, cubic, meter, when, taken, orally, 3, grams, of, iodine, can, be, lethal, iodide, anions, are, mostly, nontoxic, but, these, can, also, be, deadly, if, ingested, in, large, amounts, astatine, is, radioactive, and, thus, highly, dangerous, but, it, has, not, been, produced, in, macroscopic, quantities, and, hence, it, is, most, unlikely, that, its, toxicity, will, be, of, much, relevance, to, the, average, individual, tennessine, cannot, be, chemically, investigated, due, to, how, short, its, half, life, is, although, its, radioactivity, would, make, it, very, dangerous, certain, aluminium, clusters, have, superatom, properties, these, aluminium, clusters, are, generated, as, anions, al, n, with, n, 1, 2, 3, in, helium, gas, and, reacted, with, a, gas, containing, iodine, when, analyzed, by, mass, spectrometry, one, main, reaction, product, turns, out, to, be, al, 13, i, these, clusters, of, 13, aluminium, atoms, with, an, extra, electron, added, do, not, appear, to, react, with, oxygen, when, it, is, introduced, in, the, same, gas, stream, assuming, each, atom, liberates, its, 3, valence, electrons, this, means, 40, electrons, are, present, which, is, one, of, the, magic, numbers, for, sodium, and, implies, that, these, numbers, are, a, reflection, of, the, noble, gases, calculations, show, that, the, additional, electron, is, located, in, the, aluminium, cluster, at, the, location, directly, opposite, from, the, iodine, atom, the, cluster, must, therefore, have, a, higher, electron, affinity, for, the, electron, than, iodine, and, therefore, the, aluminium, cluster, is, called, a, superhalogen, i, e, the, vertical, electron, detachment, energies, of, the, moieties, that, make, up, the, negative, ions, are, larger, than, those, of, any, halogen, atom, the, cluster, component, in, the, al, 13, i, ion, is, similar, to, an, iodide, ion, or, a, bromide, ion, the, related, al, 13, i, 2, cluster, is, expected, to, behave,
