the, interstellar, medium, ism, is, the, matter, and, radiation, that, exists, in, the, space, between, the, star, systems, in, a, galaxy, this, matter, includes, gas, in, ionic, atomic, and, molecular, form, as, well, as, dust, and, cosmic, rays, it, fills, interstellar, space, and, blends, smoothly, into, the, surrounding, intergalactic, space, the, energy, that, occupies, the, same, volume, in, the, form, of, electromagnetic, radiation, is, the, interstellar, radiation, field, although, the, density, of, atoms, in, the, ism, is, usually, far, below, that, in, the, best, laboratory, vacuums, the, mean, free, path, between, collisions, is, short, compared, to, typical, interstellar, lengths, so, on, these, scales, the, ism, behaves, as, a, gas, more, precisely, as, a, plasma, it, is, everywhere, at, least, slightly, ionized, responding, to, pressure, forces, and, not, as, a, collection, of, non, interacting, particles, the, interstellar, medium, is, composed, of, multiple, phases, distinguished, by, whether, matter, is, ionic, atomic, or, molecular, and, the, temperature, and, density, of, the, matter, the, interstellar, medium, is, composed, primarily, of, hydrogen, followed, by, helium, with, trace, amounts, of, carbon, oxygen, and, nitrogen, the, thermal, pressures, of, these, phases, are, in, rough, equilibrium, with, one, another, magnetic, fields, and, turbulent, motions, also, provide, pressure, in, the, ism, and, are, typically, more, important, dynamically, than, the, thermal, pressure, in, the, interstellar, medium, matter, is, primarily, in, molecular, form, and, reaches, number, densities, of, 10, 12, molecules, per, m, 3, 1, trillion, molecules, per, m, 3, in, hot, diffuse, regions, gas, is, highly, ionized, and, the, density, may, be, as, low, as, 100, ions, per, m, 3, compare, this, with, a, number, density, of, roughly, 10, 25, molecules, per, m, 3, for, air, at, sea, level, and, 10, 16, molecules, per, m, 3, 10, quadrillion, molecules, per, m, 3, for, a, laboratory, high, vacuum, chamber, within, our, galaxy, by, mass, 99, of, the, ism, is, gas, in, any, form, and, 1, is, dust, of, the, gas, in, the, ism, by, number, 91, of, atoms, are, hydrogen, and, 8, 9, are, helium, with, 0, 1, being, atoms, of, elements, heavier, than, hydrogen, or, helium, known, as, metals, in, astronomical, parlance, by, mass, this, amounts, to, 70, hydrogen, 28, helium, and, 1, 5, heavier, elements, the, hydrogen, and, helium, are, primarily, a, result, of, primordial, nucleosynthesis, while, the, heavier, elements, in, the, ism, are, mostly, a, result, of, enrichment, due, to, stellar, nucleosynthesis, in, the, process, of, stellar, evolution, the, ism, plays, a, crucial, role, in, astrophysics, precisely, because, of, its, intermediate, role, between, stellar, and, galactic, scales, stars, form, within, the, densest, regions, of, the, ism, which, ultimately, contributes, to, molecular, clouds, and, replenishes, the, ism, with, matter, and, energy, through, planetary, nebulae, stellar, winds, and, supernovae, this, interplay, between, stars, and, the, ism, helps, determine, the, rate, at, which, a, galaxy, depletes, its, gaseous, content, and, therefore, its, lifespan, of, active, star, formation, voyager, 1, reached, the, ism, on, august, 25, 2012, making, it, the, first, artificial, object, from, earth, to, do, so, interstellar, plasma, and, dust, will, be, studied, until, the, estimated, mission, end, date, of, 2025, its, twin, voyager, 2, entered, the, ism, on, november, 5, 2018, table, 1, shows, a, breakdown, of, the, properties, of, the, components, of, the, ism, of, the, milky, way, field, goldsmith, habing, 1969, put, forward, the, static, two, phase, equilibrium, model, to, explain, the, observed, properties, of, the, ism, their, modeled, ism, included, a, cold, dense, phase, t, 300, k, consisting, of, clouds, of, neutral, and, molecular, hydrogen, and, a, warm, intercloud, phase, t, 10, 4, k, consisting, of, rarefied, neutral, and, ionized, gas, mckee, ostriker, 1977, added, a, dynamic, third, phase, that, represented, the, very, hot, t, 10, 6, k, gas, that, had, been, shock, heated, by, supernovae, and, constituted, most, of, the, volume, of, the, ism, these, phases, are, the, temperatures, where, heating, and, cooling, can, reach, a, stable, equilibrium, their, paper, formed, the, basis, for, further, study, over, the, subsequent, three, decades, however, the, relative, proportions, of, the, phases, and, their, subdivisions, are, still, not, well, understood, the, basic, physics, behind, these, phases, can, be, understood, through, the, behaviour, of, hydrogen, since, this, is, by, far, the, largest, constituent, of, the, ism, the, different, phases, are, roughly, in, pressure, balance, over, most, of, the, galactic, disk, since, regions, of, excess, pressure, will, expand, and, cool, and, likewise, under, pressure, regions, will, be, compressed, and, heated, therefore, since, p, n, k, t, hot, regions, high, t, generally, have, low, particle, number, density, n, coronal, gas, has, low, enough, density, that, collisions, between, particles, are, rare, and, so, little, radiation, is, produced, hence, there, is, little, loss, of, energy, and, the, temperature, can, stay, high, for, periods, of, hundreds, of, millions, of, years, in, contrast, once, the, temperature, falls, to, o, 10, 5, k, with, correspondingly, higher, density, protons, and, electrons, can, recombine, to, form, hydrogen, atoms, emitting, photons, which, take, energy, out, of, the, gas, leading, to, runaway, cooling, left, to, itself, this, would, produce, the, warm, neutral, medium, however, ob, stars, are, so, hot, that, some, of, their, photons, have, energy, greater, than, the, lyman, limit, e, 13, 6, ev, enough, to, ionize, hydrogen, such, photons, will, be, absorbed, by, and, ionize, any, neutral, hydrogen, atom, they, encounter, setting, up, a, dynamic, equilibrium, between, ionization, and, recombination, such, that, gas, close, enough, to, ob, stars, is, almost, entirely, ionized, with, temperature, around, 8000, k, unless, already, in, the, coronal, phase, until, the, distance, where, all, the, ionizing, photons, are, used, up, this, ionization, front, marks, the, boundary, between, the, warm, ionized, and, warm, neutral, medium, ob, stars, and, also, cooler, ones, produce, many, more, photons, with, energies, below, the, lyman, limit, which, pass, through, the, ionized, region, almost, unabsorbed, some, of, these, have, high, enough, energy, 11, 3, ev, to, ionize, carbon, atoms, creating, a, c, ii, ionized, carbon, region, outside, the, hydrogen, ionization, front, in, dense, regions, this, may, also, be, limited, in, size, by, the, availability, of, photons, but, often, such, photons, can, penetrate, throughout, the, neutral, phase, and, only, get, absorbed, in, the, outer, layers, of, molecular, clouds, photons, with, e, 4, ev, or, so, can, break, up, molecules, such, as, h, 2, and, co, creating, a, photodissociation, region, pdr, which, is, more, or, less, equivalent, to, the, warm, neutral, medium, these, processes, contribute, to, the, heating, of, the, wnm, the, distinction, between, warm, and, cold, neutral, medium, is, again, due, to, a, range, of, temperature, density, in, which, runaway, cooling, occurs, the, densest, molecular, clouds, have, significantly, higher, pressure, than, the, interstellar, average, since, they, are, bound, together, by, their, own, gravity, when, stars, form, in, such, clouds, especially, ob, stars, they, convert, the, surrounding, gas, into, the, warm, ionized, phase, a, temperature, increase, of, several, hundred, initially, the, gas, is, still, at, molecular, cloud, densities, and, so, at, vastly, higher, pressure, than, the, ism, average, this, is, a, classical, h, ii, region, the, large, overpressure, causes, the, ionized, gas, to, expand, away, from, the, remaining, molecular, gas, a, champagne, flow, and, the, flow, will, continue, until, either, the, molecular, cloud, is, fully, evaporated, or, the, ob, stars, reach, the, end, of, their, lives, after, a, few, millions, years, at, this, point, the, ob, stars, explode, as, supernovas, creating, blast, waves, in, the, warm, gas, that, increase, temperatures, to, the, coronal, phase, supernova, remnants, snr, these, too, expand, and, cool, over, several, million, years, until, they, return, to, average, ism, pressure, most, discussion, of, the, ism, concerns, spiral, galaxies, like, the, milky, way, in, which, nearly, all, the, mass, in, the, ism, is, confined, to, a, relatively, thin, disk, typically, with, scale, height, about, 100, parsecs, 300, light, years, which, can, be, compared, to, a, typical, disk, diameter, of, 30, 000, parsecs, gas, and, stars, in, the, disk, orbit, the, galactic, centre, with, typical, orbital, speeds, of, 200, km, s, this, is, much, faster, than, the, random, motions, of, atoms, in, the, ism, but, since, the, orbital, motion, of, the, gas, is, coherent, the, average, motion, does, not, directly, affect, structure, in, the, ism, the, vertical, scale, height, of, the, ism, is, set, in, roughly, the, same, way, as, the, earth, s, atmosphere, as, a, balance, between, the, local, gravitation, field, dominated, by, the, stars, in, the, disk, and, the, pressure, further, from, the, disk, plane, the, ism, is, mainly, in, the, low, density, warm, and, coronal, phases, which, extend, at, least, several, thousand, parsecs, away, from, the, disk, plane, this, galactic, halo, or, corona, also, contains, significant, magnetic, field, and, cosmic, ray, energy, density, the, rotation, of, galaxy, disks, influences, ism, structures, in, several, ways, since, the, angular, velocity, declines, with, increasing, distance, from, the, centre, any, ism, feature, such, as, giant, molecular, clouds, or, magnetic, field, lines, that, extend, across, a, range, of, radius, are, sheared, by, differential, rotation, and, so, tend, to, become, stretched, out, in, the, tangential, direction, this, tendency, is, opposed, by, interstellar, turbulence, see, below, which, tends, to, randomize, the, structures, spiral, arms, are, due, to, perturbations, in, the, disk, orbits, essentially, ripples, in, the, disk, that, cause, orbits, to, alternately, converge, and, diverge, compressing, and, then, expanding, the, local, ism, the, visible, spiral, arms, are, the, regions, of, maximum, density, and, the, compression, often, triggers, star, formation, in, molecular, clouds, leading, to, an, abundance, of, h, ii, regions, along, the, arms, coriolis, force, also, influences, large, ism, features, irregular, galaxies, such, as, the, magellanic, clouds, have, similar, interstellar, mediums, to, spirals, but, less, organized, in, elliptical, galaxies, the, ism, is, almost, entirely, in, the, coronal, phase, since, there, is, no, coherent, disk, motion, to, support, cold, gas, far, from, the, center, instead, the, scale, height, of, the, ism, must, be, comperable, to, the, radius, of, the, galaxy, this, is, consistent, with, the, observation, that, there, is, little, sign, of, current, star, formation, in, ellipticals, some, elliptical, galaxies, do, show, evidence, for, a, small, disk, component, with, ism, similar, to, spirals, buried, close, to, their, centers, the, ism, of, lenticular, galaxies, as, with, their, other, properties, appear, intermediate, between, spirals, and, ellipticals, very, close, to, the, center, of, most, galaxies, within, a, few, hundred, light, years, at, most, the, ism, is, profoundly, modified, by, the, central, supermassive, black, hole, see, galactic, center, for, the, milky, way, and, active, galactic, nucleus, for, extreme, examples, in, other, galaxies, the, rest, of, this, article, will, focus, on, the, ism, in, the, disk, plane, of, spirals, far, from, the, galactic, center, astronomers, describe, the, ism, as, turbulent, meaning, that, the, gas, has, quasi, random, motions, coherent, over, a, large, range, of, spatial, scales, unlike, normal, turbulence, in, which, the, fluid, motions, are, highly, subsonic, the, bulk, motions, of, the, ism, are, usually, larger, than, the, sound, speed, supersonic, collisions, between, gas, clouds, cause, shock, waves, which, compress, and, heat, the, gas, increasing, the, sounds, speed, so, that, the, flow, is, locally, subsonic, thus, supersonic, turbulence, has, been, described, as, a, box, of, shocklets, and, is, inevitably, associated, with, complex, density, and, temperature, structure, in, the, ism, this, is, further, complicated, by, the, magnetic, field, which, provides, wave, modes, such, as, alfv, n, waves, which, are, often, faster, than, pure, sound, waves, if, turbulent, speeds, are, supersonic, but, below, the, alfv, n, wave, speed, the, behaviour, is, more, like, subsonic, turbulence, stars, are, born, deep, inside, large, complexes, of, molecular, clouds, typically, a, few, parsecs, in, size, during, their, lives, and, deaths, stars, interact, physically, with, the, ism, stellar, winds, from, young, clusters, of, stars, often, with, giant, or, supergiant, hii, regions, surrounding, them, and, shock, waves, created, by, supernovae, inject, enormous, amounts, of, energy, into, their, surroundings, which, leads, to, hypersonic, turbulence, the, resultant, structures, of, varying, sizes, can, be, observed, such, as, stellar, wind, bubbles, and, superbubbles, of, hot, gas, seen, by, x, ray, satellite, telescopes, or, turbulent, flows, observed, in, radio, telescope, maps, stars, and, planets, once, formed, are, unaffected, by, pressure, forces, in, the, ism, and, so, do, not, take, part, in, the, turbulent, motions, although, stars, formed, in, molecular, clouds, in, a, galactic, disk, share, their, general, orbital, motion, around, the, galaxy, center, thus, stars, are, usually, in, motion, relative, to, their, surrounding, ism, the, sun, is, currently, traveling, through, the, local, interstellar, cloud, an, irregular, clump, of, the, warm, neutral, medium, a, few, parsecs, across, within, the, low, density, local, bubble, a, 100, parsec, radius, region, of, coronal, gas, in, october, 2020, astronomers, reported, a, significant, unexpected, increase, in, density, in, the, space, beyond, the, solar, system, as, detected, by, the, voyager, 1, and, voyager, 2, space, probes, according, to, the, researchers, this, implies, that, the, density, gradient, is, a, large, scale, feature, of, the, vlism, very, local, interstellar, medium, in, the, general, direction, of, the, heliospheric, nose, the, interstellar, medium, begins, where, the, interplanetary, medium, of, the, solar, system, ends, the, solar, wind, slows, to, subsonic, velocities, at, the, termination, shock, 90, 100, astronomical, units, from, the, sun, in, the, region, beyond, the, termination, shock, called, the, heliosheath, interstellar, matter, interacts, with, the, solar, wind, voyager, 1, the, farthest, human, made, object, from, the, earth, after, 1998, crossed, the, termination, shock, december, 16, 2004, and, later, entered, interstellar, space, when, it, crossed, the, heliopause, on, august, 25, 2012, providing, the, first, direct, probe, of, conditions, in, the, ism, stone, et, al, 2005, dust, grains, in, the, ism, are, responsible, for, extinction, and, reddening, the, decreasing, light, intensity, and, shift, in, the, dominant, observable, wavelengths, of, light, from, a, star, these, effects, are, caused, by, scattering, and, absorption, of, photons, and, allow, the, ism, to, be, observed, with, the, naked, eye, in, a, dark, sky, the, apparent, rifts, that, can, be, seen, in, the, band, of, the, milky, way, a, uniform, disk, of, stars, are, caused, by, absorption, of, background, starlight, by, dust, in, molecular, clouds, within, a, few, thousand, light, years, from, earth, this, effect, decreases, rapidly, with, increasing, wavelength, reddening, is, caused, by, greater, absorption, of, blue, than, red, light, and, becomes, almost, negligible, at, mid, infrared, wavelengths, 5, m, extinction, provides, one, of, the, best, ways, of, mapping, the, three, dimensional, structure, of, the, ism, especially, since, the, advent, of, accurate, distances, to, millions, of, stars, from, the, gaia, mission, the, total, amount, of, dust, in, front, of, each, star, is, determined, from, its, reddening, and, the, dust, is, then, located, along, the, line, of, sight, by, comparing, the, dust, column, density, in, front, of, stars, projected, close, together, on, the, sky, but, at, different, distances, by, 2022, it, was, possible, to, generate, a, map, of, ism, structures, within, 3, kpc, 10, 000, light, years, of, the, sun, far, ultraviolet, light, is, absorbed, effectively, by, the, neutral, hydrogen, gas, in, the, ism, specifically, atomic, hydrogen, absorbs, very, strongly, at, about, 121, 5, nanometers, the, lyman, alpha, transition, and, also, at, the, other, lyman, series, lines, therefore, it, is, nearly, impossible, to, see, light, emitted, at, those, wavelengths, from, a, star, farther, than, a, few, hundred, light, years, from, earth, because, most, of, it, is, absorbed, during, the, trip, to, earth, by, intervening, neutral, hydrogen, all, photons, with, wavelength, 91, 6, nm, the, lyman, limit, can, ionize, hydrogen, and, are, also, very, strongly, absorbed, the, absorption, gradually, decreases, with, increasing, photon, energy, and, the, ism, begins, to, become, transparent, again, in, soft, x, rays, with, wavelengths, shorter, than, about, 1, nm, the, ism, is, usually, far, from, thermodynamic, equilibrium, collisions, establish, a, maxwell, boltzmann, distribution, of, velocities, and, the, temperature, normally, used, to, describe, interstellar, gas, is, the, kinetic, temperature, which, describes, the, temperature, at, which, the, particles, would, have, the, observed, maxwell, boltzmann, velocity, distribution, in, thermodynamic, equilibrium, however, the, interstellar, radiation, field, is, typically, much, weaker, than, a, medium, in, thermodynamic, equilibrium, it, is, most, often, roughly, that, of, an, a, star, surface, temperature, of, 10, 000, k, highly, diluted, therefore, bound, levels, within, an, atom, or, molecule, in, the, ism, are, rarely, populated, according, to, the, boltzmann, formula, spitzer, 1978, 2, 4, depending, on, the, temperature, density, and, ionization, state, of, a, portion, of, the, ism, different, heating, and, cooling, mechanisms, determine, the, temperature, of, the, gas, grain, heating, by, thermal, exchange, is, very, important, in, supernova, remnants, where, densities, and, temperatures, are, very, high, gas, heating, via, grain, gas, collisions, is, dominant, deep, in, giant, molecular, clouds, especially, at, high, densities, far, infrared, radiation, penetrates, deeply, due, to, the, low, optical, depth, dust, grains, are, heated, via, this, radiation, and, can, transfer, thermal, energy, during, collisions, with, the, gas, a, measure, of, efficiency, in, the, heating, is, given, by, the, accommodation, coefficient, t, 2, t, t, d, t, displaystyle, alpha, frac, t, 2, t, t, d, t, where, t, is, the, gas, temperature, t, d, the, dust, temperature, and, t, 2, the, post, collision, temperature, of, the, gas, atom, or, molecule, this, coefficient, was, measured, by, burke, hollenbach, 1983, as, 0, 35, despite, its, extremely, low, density, photons, generated, in, the, ism, are, prominent, in, nearly, all, bands, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, in, fact, the, optical, band, on, which, astronomers, relied, until, well, into, the, 20th, century, is, the, one, in, which, the, ism, is, least, obvious, radio, waves, are, affected, by, the, plasma, properties, of, the, ism, the, lowest, frequency, radio, waves, below, 0, 1, mhz, cannot, propagate, through, the, ism, since, they, are, below, its, plasma, frequency, at, higher, frequencies, the, plasma, has, a, significant, refractive, index, decreasing, with, increasing, frequency, and, also, dependent, on, the, density, of, free, electrons, random, variations, in, the, electron, density, cause, interstellar, scintillation, which, broadens, the, apparent, size, of, distant, radio, sources, seen, through, the, ism, with, the, broadening, decreasing, with, frequency, squared, the, variation, of, refractive, index, with, frequency, causes, the, arrival, times, of, pulses, from, pulsars, and, fast, radio, bursts, to, be, delayed, at, lower, frequencies, dispersion, the, amount, of, delay, is, proportional, to, the, column, density, of, free, electrons, dispersion, measure, dm, which, is, useful, for, both, mapping, the, distribution, of, ionized, gas, in, the, galaxy, and, estimating, distances, to, pulsars, more, distant, ones, have, larger, dm, a, second, propagation, effect, is, faraday, rotation, which, affects, linearly, polarized, radio, waves, such, as, those, produced, by, synchrotron, radiation, one, of, the, most, common, sources, of, radio, emission, in, astrophysics, faraday, rotation, depends, on, both, the, electron, density, and, the, magnetic, field, strength, and, so, is, used, as, a, probe, of, the, interstellar, magnetic, field, the, ism, is, generally, very, transparent, to, radio, waves, allowing, unimpeded, observations, right, through, the, disk, of, the, galaxy, there, are, a, few, exceptions, to, this, rule, the, most, intense, spectral, lines, in, the, radio, spectrum, can, become, opaque, so, that, only, the, surface, of, the, line, emitting, cloud, is, visible, this, mainly, affects, the, carbon, monoxide, lines, at, millimetre, wavelengths, that, are, used, to, trace, molecular, clouds, but, the, 21, cm, line, from, neutral, hydrogen, can, become, opaque, in, the, cold, neutral, medium, such, absorption, only, affects, photons, at, the, line, frequencies, the, clouds, are, otherwise, transparent, the, other, significant, absorption, process, occurs, in, dense, ionized, regions, these, emit, photons, including, radio, waves, via, thermal, bremsstrahlung, at, short, wavelengths, typically, microwaves, these, are, quite, transparent, but, their, brightness, approaches, the, black, body, limit, as, 2, 1, displaystyle, propto, lambda, 2, 1, and, at, wavelengths, long, enough, that, this, limit, is, reached, they, become, opaque, thus, metre, wavelength, observations, show, h, ii, regions, as, cool, spots, blocking, the, bright, background, emission, from, galactic, synchrotron, radiation, while, at, decametres, the, entire, galactic, plane, is, absorbed, and, the, longest, radio, waves, observed, 1, km, can, only, propagate, 10, 50, parsecs, through, the, local, bubble, the, frequency, at, which, a, particular, nebula, becomes, optically, thick, depends, on, its, emission, measure, the, column, density, of, squared, electron, number, density, exceptionally, dense, nebulae, can, become, optically, thick, at, centimetre, wavelengths, these, are, just, formed, and, so, both, rare, and, small, ultra, compact, h, ii, regions, the, general, transparency, of, the, ism, to, radio, waves, especially, microwaves, may, seem, surprising, since, radio, waves, at, frequencies, 10, ghz, are, significantly, attenuated, by, earth, s, atmosphere, as, seen, in, the, figure, but, the, column, density, through, the, atmosphere, is, vastly, larger, than, the, column, through, the, entire, galaxy, due, to, the, extremely, low, density, of, the, ism, the, word, interstellar, between, the, stars, was, coined, by, francis, bacon, in, the, context, of, the, ancient, theory, of, a, literal, sphere, of, fixed, stars, later, in, the, 17th, century, when, the, idea, that, stars, were, scattered, through, infinite, space, became, popular, it, was, debated, whether, that, space, was, a, true, vacuum, or, filled, with, a, hypothetical, fluid, sometimes, called, aether, as, in, ren, descartes, vortex, theory, of, planetary, motions, while, vortex, theory, did, not, survive, the, success, of, newtonian, physics, an, invisible, luminiferous, aether, was, re, introduced, in, the, early, 19th, century, as, the, medium, to, carry, light, waves, e, g, in, 1862, a, journalist, wrote, this, efflux, occasions, a, thrill, or, vibratory, motion, in, the, ether, which, fills, the, interstellar, spaces, in, 1864, william, huggins, used, spectroscopy, to, determine, that, a, nebula, is, made, of, gas, huggins, had, a, private, observatory, with, an, 8, inch, telescope, with, a, lens, by, alvan, clark, but, it, was, equipped, for, spectroscopy, which, enabled, breakthrough, observations, from, around, 1889, edward, barnard, pioneered, deep, photography, of, the, sky, finding, many, holes, in, the, milky, way, at, first, he, compared, them, to, sunspots, but, by, 1899, was, prepared, to, write, one, can, scarcely, conceive, a, vacancy, with, holes, in, it, unless, there, is, nebulous, matter, covering, these, apparently, vacant, places, in, which, holes, might, occur, these, holes, are, now, known, as, dark, nebulae, dusty, molecular, clouds, silhouetted, against, the, background, star, field, of, the, galaxy, the, most, prominent, are, listed, in, his, barnard, catalogue, the, first, direct, detection, of, cold, diffuse, matter, in, interstellar, space, came, in, 1904, when, johannes, hartmann, observed, the, binary, star, mintaka, delta, orionis, with, the, potsdam, great, refractor, hartmann, reported, that, absorption, from, the, k, line, of, calcium, appeared, extraordinarily, weak, but, almost, perfectly, sharp, and, also, reported, the, quite, surprising, result, that, the, calcium, line, at, 393, 4, nanometres, does, not, share, in, the, periodic, displacements, of, the, lines, caused, by, the, orbital, motion, of, the, spectroscopic, binary, star, the, stationary, nature, of, the, line, led, hartmann, to, conclude, that, the, gas, responsible, for, the, absorption, was, not, present, in, the, atmosphere, of, the, star, but, was, instead, located, within, an, isolated, cloud, of, matter, residing, somewhere, along, the, line, of, sight, to, this, star, this, discovery, launched, the, study, of, the, interstellar, medium, interstellar, gas, was, further, confirmed, by, slipher, in, 1909, and, then, by, 1912, interstellar, dust, was, confirmed, by, slipher, interstellar, sodium, was, detected, by, mary, lea, heger, in, 1919, through, the, observation, of, stationary, absorption, from, the, atom, s, d, lines, at, 589, 0, and, 589, 6, nanometres, towards, delta, orionis, and, beta, scorpii, in, the, series, of, investigations, viktor, ambartsumian, introduced, the, now, commonly, accepted, notion, that, interstellar, matter, occurs, in, the, form, of, clouds, subsequent, observations, of, the, h, and, k, lines, of, calcium, by, beals, 1936, revealed, double, and, asymmetric, profiles, in, the, spectra, of, epsilon, and, zeta, orionis, these, were, the, first, steps, in, the, study, of, the, very, complex, interstellar, sightline, towards, orion, asymmetric, absorption, line, profiles, are, the, result, of, the, superposition, of, multiple, absorption, lines, each, corresponding, to, the, same, atomic, transition, for, example, the, k, line, of, calcium, but, occurring, in, interstellar, clouds, with, different, radial, velocities, because, each, cloud, has, a, different, velocity, either, towards, or, away, from, the, observer, earth, the, absorption, lines, occurring, within, each, cloud, are, either, blue, shifted, or, red, shifted, respectively, from, the, lines, rest, wavelength, through, the, doppler, effect, these, observations, confirming, that, matter, is, not, distributed, homogeneously, were, the, first, evidence, of, multiple, discrete, clouds, within, the, ism, the, growing, evidence, for, interstellar, material, led, pickering, 1912, to, comment, while, the, interstellar, absorbing, medium, may, be, simply, the, ether, yet, the, character, of, its, selective, absorption, as, indicated, by, kapteyn, is, characteristic, of, a, gas, and, free, gaseous, molecules, are, certainly, there, since, they, are, probably, constantly, being, expelled, by, the, sun, and, stars, the, same, year, victor, hess, s, discovery, of, cosmic, rays, highly, energetic, charged, particles, that, rain, onto, the, earth, from, space, led, others, to, speculate, whether, they, also, pervaded, interstellar, space, the, following, year, the, norwegian, explorer, and, physicist, kristian, birkeland, wrote, it, seems, to, be, a, natural, consequence, of, our, points, of, view, to, assume, that, the, whole, of, space, is, filled, with, electrons, and, flying, electric, ions, of, all, kinds, we, have, assumed, that, each, stellar, system, in, evolutions, throws, off, electric, corpuscles, into, space, it, does, not, seem, unreasonable, therefore, to, think, that, the, greater, part, of, the, material, masses, in, the, universe, is, found, not, in, the, solar, systems, or, nebulae, but, in, empty, space, birkeland, 1913, thorndike, 1930, noted, that, it, could, scarcely, have, been, believed, that, the, enormous, gaps, between, the, stars, are, completely, void, terrestrial, aurorae, are, not, improbably, excited, by, charged, particles, emitted, by, the, sun, if, the, millions, of, other, stars, are, also, ejecting, ions, as, is, undoubtedly, true, no, absolute, vacuum, can, exist, within, the, galaxy, in, september, 2012, nasa, scientists, reported, that, polycyclic, aromatic, hydrocarbons, pahs, subjected, to, interstellar, medium, ism, conditions, are, transformed, through, hydrogenation, oxygenation, and, hydroxylation, to, more, complex, organics, a, step, along, the, path, toward, amino, acids, and, nucleotides, the, raw, materials, of, proteins, and, dna, respectively, further, as, a, result, of, these, transformations, the, pahs, lose, their, spectroscopic, signature, which, could, be, one, of, the, reasons, for, the, lack, of, pah, detection, in, interstellar, ice, grains, particularly, the, outer, regions, of, cold, dense, clouds, or, the, upper, molecular, layers, of, protoplanetary, disks, in, february, 2014, nasa, announced, a, greatly, upgraded, database, for, tracking, polycyclic, aromatic, hydrocarbons, pahs, in, the, universe, according, to, scientists, more, than, 20, of, the, carbon, in, the, universe, may, be, associated, with, pahs, possible, starting, materials, for, the, formation, of, life, pahs, seem, to, have, been, formed, shortly, after, the, big, bang, are, widespread, throughout, the, universe, and, are, associated, with, new, stars, and, exoplanets, in, april, 2019, scientists, working, with, the, hubble, space, telescope, reported, the, confirmed, detection, of, the, large, and, complex, ionized, molecules, of, buckminsterfullerene, c, 60, also, known, as, buckyballs, in, the, interstellar, medium, spaces, between, the, stars, in, september, 2020, evidence, was, presented, of, solid, state, water, in, the, interstellar, medium, and, particularly, of, water, ice, mixed, with, silicate, grains, in, cosmic, dust, grains
