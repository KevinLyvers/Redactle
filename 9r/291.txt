materials, science, is, an, interdisciplinary, field, of, researching, and, discovering, materials, materials, engineering, is, an, engineering, field, of, finding, uses, for, materials, in, other, fields, and, industries, the, intellectual, origins, of, materials, science, stem, from, the, age, of, enlightenment, when, researchers, began, to, use, analytical, thinking, from, chemistry, physics, and, engineering, to, understand, ancient, phenomenological, observations, in, metallurgy, and, mineralogy, materials, science, still, incorporates, elements, of, physics, chemistry, and, engineering, as, such, the, field, was, long, considered, by, academic, institutions, as, a, sub, field, of, these, related, fields, beginning, in, the, 1940s, materials, science, began, to, be, more, widely, recognized, as, a, specific, and, distinct, field, of, science, and, engineering, and, major, technical, universities, around, the, world, created, dedicated, schools, for, its, study, materials, scientists, emphasize, understanding, how, the, history, of, a, material, processing, influences, its, structure, and, thus, the, material, s, properties, and, performance, the, understanding, of, processing, structure, properties, relationships, is, called, the, materials, paradigm, this, paradigm, is, used, to, advance, understanding, in, a, variety, of, research, areas, including, nanotechnology, biomaterials, and, metallurgy, materials, science, is, also, an, important, part, of, forensic, engineering, and, failure, analysis, investigating, materials, products, structures, or, components, which, fail, or, do, not, function, as, intended, causing, personal, injury, or, damage, to, property, such, investigations, are, key, to, understanding, for, example, the, causes, of, various, aviation, accidents, and, incidents, the, material, of, choice, of, a, given, era, is, often, a, defining, point, phases, such, as, stone, age, bronze, age, iron, age, and, steel, age, are, historic, if, arbitrary, examples, originally, deriving, from, the, manufacture, of, ceramics, and, its, putative, derivative, metallurgy, materials, science, is, one, of, the, oldest, forms, of, engineering, and, applied, science, modern, materials, science, evolved, directly, from, metallurgy, which, itself, evolved, from, the, use, of, fire, a, major, breakthrough, in, the, understanding, of, materials, occurred, in, the, late, 19th, century, when, the, american, scientist, josiah, willard, gibbs, demonstrated, that, the, thermodynamic, properties, related, to, atomic, structure, in, various, phases, are, related, to, the, physical, properties, of, a, material, important, elements, of, modern, materials, science, were, products, of, the, space, race, the, understanding, and, engineering, of, the, metallic, alloys, and, silica, and, carbon, materials, used, in, building, space, vehicles, enabling, the, exploration, of, space, materials, science, has, driven, and, been, driven, by, the, development, of, revolutionary, technologies, such, as, rubbers, plastics, semiconductors, and, biomaterials, before, the, 1960s, and, in, some, cases, decades, after, many, eventual, materials, science, departments, were, metallurgy, or, ceramics, engineering, departments, reflecting, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, emphasis, on, metals, and, ceramics, the, growth, of, material, science, in, the, united, states, was, catalyzed, in, part, by, the, advanced, research, projects, agency, which, funded, a, series, of, university, hosted, laboratories, in, the, early, 1960s, to, expand, the, national, program, of, basic, research, and, training, in, the, materials, sciences, in, comparison, with, mechanical, engineering, the, nascent, material, science, field, focused, on, addressing, materials, from, the, macro, level, and, on, the, approach, that, materials, are, designed, on, the, basis, of, knowledge, of, behavior, at, the, microscopic, level, due, to, the, expanded, knowledge, of, the, link, between, atomic, and, molecular, processes, as, well, as, the, overall, properties, of, materials, the, design, of, materials, came, to, be, based, on, specific, desired, properties, the, materials, science, field, has, since, broadened, to, include, every, class, of, materials, including, ceramics, polymers, semiconductors, magnetic, materials, biomaterials, and, nanomaterials, generally, classified, into, three, distinct, groups, ceramics, metals, and, polymers, the, prominent, change, in, materials, science, during, the, recent, decades, is, active, usage, of, computer, simulations, to, find, new, materials, predict, properties, and, understand, phenomena, a, material, is, defined, as, a, substance, most, often, a, solid, but, other, condensed, phases, can, be, included, that, is, intended, to, be, used, for, certain, applications, there, are, a, myriad, of, materials, around, us, they, can, be, found, in, anything, from, new, and, advanced, materials, that, are, being, developed, include, nanomaterials, biomaterials, and, energy, materials, to, name, a, few, the, basis, of, materials, science, is, studying, the, interplay, between, the, structure, of, materials, the, processing, methods, to, make, that, material, and, the, resulting, material, properties, the, complex, combination, of, these, produce, the, performance, of, a, material, in, a, specific, application, many, features, across, many, length, scales, impact, material, performance, from, the, constituent, chemical, elements, its, microstructure, and, macroscopic, features, from, processing, together, with, the, laws, of, thermodynamics, and, kinetics, materials, scientists, aim, to, understand, and, improve, materials, structure, is, one, of, the, most, important, components, of, the, field, of, materials, science, the, very, definition, of, the, field, holds, that, it, is, concerned, with, the, investigation, of, the, relationships, that, exist, between, the, structures, and, properties, of, materials, materials, science, examines, the, structure, of, materials, from, the, atomic, scale, all, the, way, up, to, the, macro, scale, characterization, is, the, way, materials, scientists, examine, the, structure, of, a, material, this, involves, methods, such, as, diffraction, with, x, rays, electrons, or, neutrons, and, various, forms, of, spectroscopy, and, chemical, analysis, such, as, raman, spectroscopy, energy, dispersive, spectroscopy, chromatography, thermal, analysis, electron, microscope, analysis, etc, structure, is, studied, in, the, following, levels, atomic, structure, deals, with, the, atoms, of, the, materials, and, how, they, are, arranged, to, give, rise, to, molecules, crystals, etc, much, of, the, electrical, magnetic, and, chemical, properties, of, materials, arise, from, this, level, of, structure, the, length, scales, involved, are, in, angstroms, the, chemical, bonding, and, atomic, arrangement, crystallography, are, fundamental, to, studying, the, properties, and, behavior, of, any, material, to, obtain, a, full, understanding, of, the, material, structure, and, how, it, relates, to, its, properties, the, materials, scientist, must, study, how, the, different, atoms, ions, and, molecules, are, arranged, and, bonded, to, each, other, this, involves, the, study, and, use, of, quantum, chemistry, or, quantum, physics, solid, state, physics, solid, state, chemistry, and, physical, chemistry, are, also, involved, in, the, study, of, bonding, and, structure, crystallography, is, the, science, that, examines, the, arrangement, of, atoms, in, crystalline, solids, crystallography, is, a, useful, tool, for, materials, scientists, one, of, the, fundamental, concepts, regarding, the, crystal, structure, of, a, material, includes, the, unit, cell, which, is, the, smallest, unit, of, a, crystal, lattice, space, lattice, that, repeats, to, make, up, the, macroscopic, crystal, structure, most, common, structural, materials, include, parallelpiped, and, hexagonal, lattice, types, new, and, advanced, materials, that, are, being, developed, include, nanomaterials, in, single, crystals, the, effects, of, the, crystalline, arrangement, of, atoms, is, often, easy, to, see, macroscopically, because, the, natural, shapes, of, crystals, reflect, the, atomic, structure, further, physical, properties, are, often, controlled, by, crystalline, defects, the, understanding, of, crystal, structures, is, an, important, prerequisite, for, understanding, crystallographic, defects, examples, of, crystal, defects, consist, of, dislocations, including, edges, screws, vacancies, self, inter, stitials, and, more, that, are, linear, planar, and, three, dimensional, types, of, defects, new, and, advanced, materials, that, are, being, developed, include, nanomaterials, biomaterials, mostly, materials, do, not, occur, as, a, single, crystal, but, in, polycrystalline, form, as, an, aggregate, of, small, crystals, or, grains, with, different, orientations, because, of, this, the, powder, diffraction, method, which, uses, diffraction, patterns, of, polycrystalline, samples, with, a, large, number, of, crystals, plays, an, important, role, in, structural, determination, most, materials, have, a, crystalline, structure, but, some, important, materials, do, not, exhibit, regular, crystal, structure, polymers, display, varying, degrees, of, crystallinity, and, many, are, completely, non, crystalline, glass, some, ceramics, and, many, natural, materials, are, amorphous, not, possessing, any, long, range, order, in, their, atomic, arrangements, the, study, of, polymers, combines, elements, of, chemical, and, statistical, thermodynamics, to, give, thermodynamic, and, mechanical, descriptions, of, physical, properties, materials, which, atoms, and, molecules, form, constituents, in, the, nanoscale, i, e, they, form, nanostructures, are, called, nanomaterials, nanomaterials, are, the, subject, of, intense, research, in, the, materials, science, community, due, to, the, unique, properties, that, they, exhibit, nanostructure, deals, with, objects, and, structures, that, are, in, the, 1, 100, nm, range, in, many, materials, atoms, or, molecules, agglomerate, to, form, objects, at, the, nanoscale, this, causes, many, interesting, electrical, magnetic, optical, and, mechanical, properties, in, describing, nanostructures, it, is, necessary, to, differentiate, between, the, number, of, dimensions, on, the, nanoscale, nanotextured, surfaces, have, one, dimension, on, the, nanoscale, i, e, only, the, thickness, of, the, surface, of, an, object, is, between, 0, 1, and, 100, nm, nanotubes, have, two, dimensions, on, the, nanoscale, i, e, the, diameter, of, the, tube, is, between, 0, 1, and, 100, nm, its, length, could, be, much, greater, finally, spherical, nanoparticles, have, three, dimensions, on, the, nanoscale, i, e, the, particle, is, between, 0, 1, and, 100, nm, in, each, spatial, dimension, the, terms, nanoparticles, and, ultrafine, particles, ufp, often, are, used, synonymously, although, ufp, can, reach, into, the, micrometre, range, the, term, nanostructure, is, often, used, when, referring, to, magnetic, technology, nanoscale, structure, in, biology, is, often, called, ultrastructure, microstructure, is, defined, as, the, structure, of, a, prepared, surface, or, thin, foil, of, material, as, revealed, by, a, microscope, above, 25, magnification, it, deals, with, objects, from, 100, nm, to, a, few, cm, the, microstructure, of, a, material, which, can, be, broadly, classified, into, metallic, polymeric, ceramic, and, composite, can, strongly, influence, physical, properties, such, as, strength, toughness, ductility, hardness, corrosion, resistance, high, low, temperature, behavior, wear, resistance, and, so, on, most, of, the, traditional, materials, such, as, metals, and, ceramics, are, microstructured, the, manufacture, of, a, perfect, crystal, of, a, material, is, physically, impossible, for, example, any, crystalline, material, will, contain, defects, such, as, precipitates, grain, boundaries, hall, petch, relationship, vacancies, interstitial, atoms, or, substitutional, atoms, the, microstructure, of, materials, reveals, these, larger, defects, and, advances, in, simulation, have, allowed, an, increased, understanding, of, how, defects, can, be, used, to, enhance, material, properties, macrostructure, is, the, appearance, of, a,
