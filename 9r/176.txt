cassiopeia, listen, is, a, constellation, and, asterism, in, the, northern, sky, named, after, the, vain, queen, cassiopeia, mother, of, andromeda, in, greek, mythology, who, boasted, about, her, unrivaled, beauty, cassiopeia, was, one, of, the, 48, constellations, listed, by, the, 2nd, century, greek, astronomer, ptolemy, and, it, remains, one, of, the, 88, modern, constellations, today, it, is, easily, recognizable, due, to, its, distinctive, w, shape, formed, by, five, bright, stars, cassiopeia, is, located, in, the, northern, sky, and, from, latitudes, above, 34, n, it, is, visible, year, round, in, the, sub, tropics, it, can, be, seen, at, its, clearest, from, september, to, early, november, and, at, low, southern, tropical, latitudes, of, less, than, 25, s, it, can, be, seen, seasonally, low, in, the, north, at, magnitude, 2, 2, alpha, cassiopeiae, or, schedar, is, the, brightest, star, in, cassiopeia, the, constellation, hosts, some, of, the, most, luminous, stars, known, including, the, yellow, hypergiants, rho, cassiopeiae, and, v509, cassiopeiae, and, white, hypergiant, 6, cassiopeiae, in, 1572, tycho, brahe, s, supernova, flared, brightly, in, cassiopeia, cassiopeia, a, is, a, supernova, remnant, and, the, brightest, extrasolar, radio, source, in, the, sky, at, frequencies, above, 1, ghz, fourteen, star, systems, have, been, found, to, have, exoplanets, one, of, which, hd, 219134, is, thought, to, host, six, planets, a, rich, section, of, the, milky, way, runs, through, cassiopeia, containing, a, number, of, open, clusters, young, luminous, galactic, disc, stars, and, nebulae, ic, 10, is, an, irregular, galaxy, that, is, the, closest, known, starburst, galaxy, and, the, only, one, in, the, local, group, of, galaxies, the, constellation, is, named, after, cassiopeia, the, queen, of, aethiopia, cassiopeia, was, the, wife, of, king, cepheus, of, aethiopia, and, mother, of, princess, andromeda, cepheus, and, cassiopeia, were, placed, next, to, each, other, among, the, stars, along, with, andromeda, she, was, placed, in, the, sky, as, a, punishment, after, enraging, poseidon, with, the, boast, that, her, daughter, andromeda, was, more, beautiful, than, the, nereids, or, alternatively, that, she, herself, was, more, beautiful, than, the, sea, nymphs, she, was, forced, to, wheel, around, the, north, celestial, pole, on, her, throne, spending, half, of, her, time, clinging, to, it, so, she, does, not, fall, off, and, poseidon, decreed, that, andromeda, should, be, bound, to, a, rock, as, prey, for, the, monster, cetus, andromeda, was, then, rescued, by, the, hero, perseus, whom, she, later, married, cassiopeia, has, been, variously, portrayed, throughout, her, history, as, a, constellation, in, persia, she, was, drawn, by, al, sufi, as, a, queen, holding, a, staff, with, a, crescent, moon, in, her, right, hand, wearing, a, crown, as, well, as, a, two, humped, camel, in, france, she, was, portrayed, as, having, a, marble, throne, and, a, palm, leaf, in, her, left, hand, holding, her, robe, in, her, right, hand, this, depiction, is, from, augustin, royer, s, 1679, atlas, in, chinese, astronomy, the, stars, forming, the, constellation, cassiopeia, are, found, among, three, areas, the, purple, forbidden, enclosure, z, w, i, yu, n, the, black, tortoise, of, the, north, b, i, f, ng, xu, n, w, and, the, white, tiger, of, the, west, x, f, ng, b, i, h, the, chinese, astronomers, saw, several, figures, in, what, is, modern, day, cassiopeia, kappa, eta, and, mu, cassiopeiae, formed, a, constellation, called, the, bridge, of, the, kings, when, seen, along, with, alpha, and, beta, cassiopeiae, they, formed, the, great, chariot, wang, liang, the, charioteer, s, whip, was, represented, by, gamma, cassiopeiae, sometimes, called, tsih, the, chinese, word, for, whip, in, hindu, mythology, cassiopeia, was, associated, with, the, mythological, figure, sharmishtha, the, daughter, of, the, great, devil, daitya, king, vrishparva, and, a, friend, to, devayani, andromeda, in, welsh, mythology, llys, d, n, literally, the, court, of, d, n, is, the, traditional, welsh, name, for, the, constellation, at, least, three, of, d, n, s, children, also, have, astronomical, associations, caer, gwydion, the, fortress, of, gwydion, is, the, traditional, welsh, name, for, the, milky, way, and, caer, arianrhod, the, fortress, of, arianrhod, being, the, constellation, of, corona, borealis, in, the, 17th, century, various, biblical, figures, were, depicted, in, the, stars, of, cassiopeia, these, included, bathsheba, solomon, s, mother, deborah, an, old, testament, prophet, and, mary, magdalene, a, follower, of, jesus, a, figure, called, the, tinted, hand, also, appeared, in, the, stars, of, cassiopeia, in, some, arab, atlases, this, is, variously, said, to, represent, a, woman, s, hand, dyed, red, with, henna, as, well, as, the, bloodied, hand, of, muhammad, s, daughter, fatima, the, hand, is, made, up, of, the, stars, cas, cas, cas, cas, cas, and, cas, the, arm, is, made, up, of, the, stars, per, per, per, per, per, and, per, another, arab, constellation, that, incorporated, the, stars, of, cassiopeia, was, the, camel, its, head, was, composed, of, lambda, kappa, iota, and, phi, andromedae, its, hump, was, beta, cassiopeiae, its, body, was, the, rest, of, cassiopeia, and, the, legs, were, composed, of, stars, in, perseus, and, andromeda, other, cultures, see, a, hand, or, moose, antlers, in, the, pattern, these, include, the, s, mi, for, whom, the, w, of, cassiopeia, forms, an, elk, antler, the, chukchi, of, siberia, similarly, saw, the, five, main, stars, as, five, reindeer, stags, the, people, of, the, marshall, islands, saw, cassiopeia, as, part, of, a, great, porpoise, constellation, the, main, stars, of, cassiopeia, make, its, tail, andromeda, and, triangulum, form, its, body, and, aries, makes, its, head, in, hawaii, alpha, beta, and, gamma, cassiopeiae, were, named, alpha, cassiopeiae, was, called, poloahilani, beta, cassiopeiae, was, called, polula, and, gamma, cassiopeiae, was, called, mulehu, the, people, of, pukapuka, saw, the, figure, of, cassiopeia, as, a, distinct, constellation, called, na, taki, tolu, a, mataliki, cassiopeia, had, a, supernova, cassiopeia, a, sn, 1572, covering, 598, 4, square, degrees, and, hence, 1, 451, of, the, sky, cassiopeia, ranks, 25th, of, the, 88, constellations, in, area, it, is, bordered, by, cepheus, to, the, north, and, west, andromeda, to, the, south, and, west, perseus, to, the, southeast, and, camelopardalis, to, the, east, and, also, shares, a, short, border, with, lacerta, to, the, west, the, three, letter, abbreviation, for, the, constellation, as, adopted, by, the, international, astronomical, union, in, 1922, is, cas, the, official, constellation, boundaries, as, set, by, belgian, astronomer, eug, ne, delporte, in, 1930, are, defined, by, a, polygon, of, 30, segments, in, the, equatorial, coordinate, system, the, right, ascension, coordinates, of, these, borders, lie, between, 00, h, 27, m, 03, s, and, 23, h, 41, m, 06, s, while, the, declination, coordinates, are, between, 77, 69, and, 46, 68, its, position, in, the, northern, celestial, hemisphere, means, that, the, whole, constellation, is, visible, to, observers, north, of, 12, s, high, in, the, northern, sky, it, is, circumpolar, that, is, it, never, sets, in, the, night, sky, to, viewers, in, the, british, isles, canada, and, the, northern, united, states, the, german, cartographer, johann, bayer, used, the, greek, letters, alpha, through, omega, and, then, a, and, b, to, label, the, most, prominent, 26, stars, in, the, constellation, upsilon, was, later, found, to, be, two, stars, and, labelled, upsilon, 1, and, upsilon, 2, by, john, flamsteed, b, cassiopeiae, was, in, fact, the, supernova, known, as, tycho, s, supernova, within, the, constellation, s, borders, there, are, 157, stars, brighter, than, or, equal, to, apparent, magnitude, 6, 5, the, five, brightest, stars, of, cassiopeia, alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and, epsilon, cassiopeiae, form, the, characteristic,
