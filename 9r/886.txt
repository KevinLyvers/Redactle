in, physics, chemistry, and, other, related, fields, like, biology, a, phase, transition, or, phase, change, is, the, physical, process, of, transition, between, one, state, of, a, medium, and, another, commonly, the, term, is, used, to, refer, to, changes, among, the, basic, states, of, matter, solid, liquid, and, gas, and, in, rare, cases, plasma, a, phase, of, a, thermodynamic, system, and, the, states, of, matter, have, uniform, physical, properties, during, a, phase, transition, of, a, given, medium, certain, properties, of, the, medium, change, as, a, result, of, the, change, of, external, conditions, such, as, temperature, or, pressure, this, can, be, a, discontinuous, change, for, example, a, liquid, may, become, gas, upon, heating, to, its, boiling, point, resulting, in, an, abrupt, change, in, volume, the, identification, of, the, external, conditions, at, which, a, transformation, occurs, defines, the, phase, transition, point, phase, transitions, commonly, refer, to, when, a, substance, transforms, between, one, of, the, four, states, of, matter, to, another, at, the, phase, transition, point, for, a, substance, for, instance, the, boiling, point, the, two, phases, involved, liquid, and, vapor, have, identical, free, energies, and, therefore, are, equally, likely, to, exist, below, the, boiling, point, the, liquid, is, the, more, stable, state, of, the, two, whereas, above, the, boiling, point, the, gaseous, form, is, the, more, stable, common, transitions, between, the, solid, liquid, and, gaseous, phases, of, a, single, component, due, to, the, effects, of, temperature, and, or, pressure, are, identified, in, the, following, table, for, a, single, component, the, most, stable, phase, at, different, temperatures, and, pressures, can, be, shown, on, a, phase, diagram, such, a, diagram, usually, depicts, states, in, equilibrium, a, phase, transition, usually, occurs, when, the, pressure, or, temperature, changes, and, the, system, crosses, from, one, region, to, another, like, water, turning, from, liquid, to, solid, as, soon, as, the, temperature, drops, below, the, freezing, point, in, exception, to, the, usual, case, it, is, sometimes, possible, to, change, the, state, of, a, system, diabatically, as, opposed, to, adiabatically, in, such, a, way, that, it, can, be, brought, past, a, phase, transition, point, without, undergoing, a, phase, transition, the, resulting, state, is, metastable, i, e, less, stable, than, the, phase, to, which, the, transition, would, have, occurred, but, not, unstable, either, this, occurs, in, superheating, and, supercooling, for, example, metastable, states, do, not, appear, on, usual, phase, diagrams, phase, transitions, can, also, occur, when, a, solid, changes, to, a, different, structure, without, changing, its, chemical, makeup, in, elements, this, is, known, as, allotropy, whereas, in, compounds, it, is, known, as, polymorphism, the, change, from, one, crystal, structure, to, another, from, a, crystalline, solid, to, an, amorphous, solid, or, from, one, amorphous, structure, to, another, polyamorphs, are, all, examples, of, solid, to, solid, phase, transitions, the, martensitic, transformation, occurs, as, one, of, the, many, phase, transformations, in, carbon, steel, and, stands, as, a, model, for, displacive, phase, transformations, order, disorder, transitions, such, as, in, alpha, titanium, aluminides, as, with, states, of, matter, there, are, also, a, metastable, to, equilibrium, phase, transformation, for, structural, phase, transitions, a, metastable, polymorph, which, forms, rapidly, due, to, lower, surface, energy, will, transform, to, an, equilibrium, phase, given, sufficient, thermal, input, to, overcome, an, energetic, barrier, phase, transitions, can, also, describe, the, change, between, different, kinds, of, magnetic, ordering, the, most, well, known, is, the, transition, between, the, ferromagnetic, and, paramagnetic, phases, of, magnetic, materials, which, occurs, at, what, is, called, the, curie, point, another, example, is, the, transition, between, differently, ordered, commensurate, or, incommensurate, magnetic, structures, such, as, in, cerium, antimonide, a, simplified, but, highly, useful, model, of, magnetic, phase, transitions, is, provided, by, the, ising, model, phase, transitions, involving, solutions, and, mixtures, are, more, complicated, than, transitions, involving, a, single, compound, while, chemically, pure, compounds, exhibit, a, single, temperature, melting, point, between, solid, and, liquid, phases, mixtures, can, either, have, a, single, melting, point, known, as, congruent, melting, or, they, have, different, liquidus, and, solidus, temperatures, resulting, in, a, temperature, span, where, solid, and, liquid, coexist, in, equilibrium, this, is, often, the, case, in, solid, solutions, where, the, two, components, are, isostructural, there, are, also, a, number, of, phase, transitions, involving, three, phases, a, eutectic, transformation, in, which, a, two, component, single, phase, liquid, is, cooled, and, transforms, into, two, solid, phases, the, same, process, but, beginning, with, a, solid, instead, of, a, liquid, is, called, a, eutectoid, transformation, a, peritectic, transformation, in, which, a, two, component, single, phase, solid, is, heated, and, transforms, into, a, solid, phase, and, a, liquid, phase, a, peritectoid, reaction, is, a, peritectoid, rection, except, involving, only, solid, phases, a, monotectic, reaction, consists, of, change, from, a, liquid, and, to, a, combination, of, a, solid, and, a, second, liquid, where, the, two, liquids, display, a, miscibility, gap, separation, into, multiple, phases, can, occur, via, spinodal, decomposition, in, which, a, single, phase, is, cooled, and, separates, into, two, different, compositions, non, equilibrium, mixtures, can, occur, such, as, in, supersaturation, other, phase, changes, include, phase, transitions, occur, when, the, thermodynamic, free, energy, of, a, system, is, non, analytic, for, some, choice, of, thermodynamic, variables, cf, phases, this, condition, generally, stems, from, the, interactions, of, a, large, number, of, particles, in, a, system, and, does, not, appear, in, systems, that, are, small, phase, transitions, can, occur, for, non, thermodynamic, systems, where, temperature, is, not, a, parameter, examples, include, quantum, phase, transitions, dynamic, phase, transitions, and, topological, structural, phase, transitions, in, these, types, of, systems, other, parameters, take, the, place, of, temperature, for, instance, connection, probability, replaces, temperature, for, percolating, networks, paul, ehrenfest, classified, phase, transitions, based, on, the, behavior, of, the, thermodynamic, free, energy, as, a, function, of, other, thermodynamic, variables, under, this, scheme, phase, transitions, were, labeled, by, the, lowest, derivative, of, the, free, energy, that, is, discontinuous, at, the, transition, first, order, phase, transitions, exhibit, a, discontinuity, in, the, first, derivative, of, the, free, energy, with, respect, to, some, thermodynamic, variable, the, various, solid, liquid, gas, transitions, are, classified, as, first, order, transitions, because, they, involve, a, discontinuous, change, in, density, which, is, the, inverse, of, the, first, derivative, of, the, free, energy, with, respect, to, pressure, second, order, phase, transitions, are, continuous, in, the, first, derivative, the, order, parameter, which, is, the, first, derivative, of, the, free, energy, with, respect, to, the, external, field, is, continuous, across, the, transition, but, exhibit, discontinuity, in, a, second, derivative, of, the, free, energy, these, include, the, ferromagnetic, phase, transition, in, materials, such, as, iron, where, the, magnetization, which, is, the, first, derivative, of, the, free, energy, with, respect, to, the, applied, magnetic, field, strength, increases, continuously, from, zero, as, the, temperature, is, lowered, below, the, curie, temperature, the, magnetic, susceptibility, the, second, derivative, of, the, free, energy, with, the, field, changes, discontinuously, under, the, ehrenfest, classification, scheme, there, could, in, principle, be, third, fourth, and, higher, order, phase, transitions, for, example, the, gross, witten, wadia, phase, transition, in, 2, d, lattice, quantum, chromodynamics, is, a, third, order, phase, transition, the, curie, points, of, many, ferromagnetics, is, also, a, third, order, transition, as, shown, by, their, specific, heat, having, a, sudden, change, in, slope, in, practice, only, the, first, and, second, order, phase, transitions, are, typically, observed, the, second, order, phase, transition, was, for, a, while, controversial, as, it, seems, to, require, two, sheets, of, the, gibbs, free, energy, to, osculate, exactly, which, is, so, unlikely, as, to, never, occur, in, practice, cornelis, gorter, replied, the, criticism, by, pointing, out, that, the, gibbs, free, energy, surface, might, have, two, sheets, on, one, side, but, only, one, sheet, on, the, other, side, creating, a, forked, appearance, pp, 146, 150, the, ehrenfest, classification, implicitly, allows, for, continuous, phase, transformations, where, the, bonding, character, of, a, material, changes, but, there, is, no, discontinuity, in, any, free, energy, derivative, an, example, of, this, occurs, at, the, supercritical, liquid, gas, boundaries, the, first, example, of, a, phase, transition, which, did, not, fit, into, the, ehrenfest, classification, was, the, exact, solution, of, the, ising, model, discovered, in, 1944, by, lars, onsager, the, exact, specific, heat, differed, from, the, earlier, mean, field, approximations, which, had, predicted, that, it, has, a, simple, discontinuity, at, critical, temperature, instead, the, exact, specific, heat, had, a, logarithmic, divergence, at, the, critical, temperature, in, the, following, decades, the, ehrenfest, classification, was, replaced, by, a, simplified, classification, scheme, that, is, able, to, incorporate, such, transitions, in, the, modern, classification, scheme, phase, transitions, are, divided, into, two, broad, categories, named, similarly, to, the, ehrenfest, classes, first, order, phase, transitions, are, those, that, involve, a, latent, heat, during, such, a, transition, a, system, either, absorbs, or, releases, a, fixed, and, typically, large, amount, of, energy, per, volume, during, this, process, the, temperature, of, the, system, will, stay, constant, as, heat, is, added, the, system, is, in, a, mixed, phase, regime, in, which, some, parts, of, the, system, have, completed, the, transition, and, others, have, not, familiar, examples, are, the, melting, of, ice, or, the, boiling, of, water, the, water, does, not, instantly, turn, into, vapor, but, forms, a, turbulent, mixture, of, liquid, water, and, vapor, bubbles, yoseph, imry, and, michael, wortis, showed, that, quenched, disorder, can, broaden, a, first, order, transition, that, is, the, transformation, is, completed, over, a, finite, range, of, temperatures, but, phenomena, like, supercooling, and, superheating, survive, and, hysteresis, is, observed, on, thermal, cycling, second, order, phase, transition, s, are, also, called, continuous, phase, transitions, they, are, characterized, by, a, divergent, susceptibility, an, infinite, correlation, length, and, a, power, law, decay, of, correlations, near, criticality, examples, of, second, order, phase, transitions, are, the, ferromagnetic, transition, superconducting, transition, for, a, type, i, superconductor, the, phase, transition, is, second, order, at, zero, external, field, and, for, a, type, ii, superconductor, the, phase, transition, is, second, order, for, both, normal, state, mixed, state, and, mixed, state, superconducting, state, transitions, and, the, superfluid, transition, in, contrast, to, viscosity, thermal, expansion, and, heat, capacity, of, amorphous, materials, show, a, relatively, sudden, change, at, the, glass, transition, temperature, which, enables, accurate, detection, using, differential, scanning, calorimetry, measurements, lev, landau, gave, a, phenomenological, theory, of, second, order, phase, transitions, apart, from, isolated, simple, phase, transitions, there, exist, transition, lines, as, well, as, multicritical, points, when, varying, external, parameters, like, the, magnetic, field, or, composition, several, transitions, are, known, as, infinite, order, phase, transitions, they, are, continuous, but, break, no, symmetries, the, most, famous, example, is, the, kosterlitz, thouless, transition, in, the, two, dimensional, xy, model, many, quantum, phase, transitions, e, g, in, two, dimensional, electron, gases, belong, to, this, class, the, liquid, glass, transition, is, observed, in, many, polymers, and, other, liquids, that, can, be, supercooled, far, below, the, melting, point, of, the, crystalline, phase, this, is, atypical, in, several, respects, it, is, not, a, transition, between, thermodynamic, ground, states, it, is, widely, believed, that, the, true, ground, state, is, always, crystalline, glass, is, a, quenched, disorder, state, and, its, entropy, density, and, so, on, depend, on, the, thermal, history, therefore, the, glass, transition, is, primarily, a, dynamic, phenomenon, on, cooling, a, liquid, internal, degrees, of, freedom, successively, fall, out, of, equilibrium, some, theoretical, methods, predict, an, underlying, phase, transition, in, the, hypothetical, limit, of, infinitely, long, relaxation, times, no, direct, experimental, evidence, supports, the, existence, of, these, transitions, a, disorder, broadened, first, order, transition, occurs, over, a, finite, range, of, temperatures, where, the, fraction, of, the, low, temperature, equilibrium, phase, grows, from, zero, to, one, 100, as, the, temperature, is, lowered, this, continuous, variation, of, the, coexisting, fractions, with, temperature, raised, interesting, possibilities, on, cooling, some, liquids, vitrify, into, a, glass, rather, than, transform, to, the, equilibrium, crystal, phase, this, happens, if, the, cooling, rate, is, faster, than, a, critical, cooling, rate, and, is, attributed, to, the, molecular, motions, becoming, so, slow, that, the, molecules, cannot, rearrange, into, the, crystal, positions, this, slowing, down, happens, below, a, glass, formation, temperature, t, g, which, may, depend, on, the, applied, pressure, if, the, first, order, freezing, transition, occurs, over, a, range, of, temperatures, and, t, g, falls, within, this, range, then, there, is, an, interesting, possibility, that, the, transition, is, arrested, when, it, is, partial, and, incomplete, extending, these, ideas, to, first, order, magnetic, transitions, being, arrested, at, low, temperatures, resulted, in, the, observation, of, incomplete, magnetic, transitions, with, two, magnetic, phases, coexisting, down, to, the, lowest, temperature, first, reported, in, the, case, of, a, ferromagnetic, to, anti, ferromagnetic, transition, such, persistent, phase, coexistence, has, now, been, reported, across, a, variety, of, first, order, magnetic, transitions, these, include, colossal, magnetoresistance, manganite, materials, magnetocaloric, materials, magnetic, shape, memory, materials, and, other, materials, the, interesting, feature, of, these, observations, of, t, g, falling, within, the, temperature, range, over, which, the, transition, occurs, is, that, the, first, order, magnetic, transition, is, influenced, by, magnetic, field, just, like, the, structural, transition, is, influenced, by, pressure, the, relative, ease, with, which, magnetic, fields, can, be, controlled, in, contrast, to, pressure, raises, the, possibility, that, one, can, study, the, interplay, between, t, g, and, t, c, in, an, exhaustive, way, phase, coexistence, across, first, order, magnetic, transitions, will, then, enable, the, resolution, of, outstanding, issues, in, understanding, glasses, in, any, system, containing, liquid, and, gaseous, phases, there, exists, a, special, combination, of, pressure, and, temperature, known, as, the, critical, point, at, which, the, transition, between, liquid, and, gas, becomes, a, second, order, transition, near, the, critical, point, the, fluid, is, sufficiently, hot, and, compressed, that, the, distinction, between, the, liquid, and, gaseous, phases, is, almost, non, existent, this, is, associated, with, the, phenomenon, of, critical, opalescence, a, milky, appearance, of, the, liquid, due, to, density, fluctuations, at, all, possible, wavelengths, including, those, of, visible, light, phase, transitions, often, involve, a, symmetry, breaking, process, for, instance, the, cooling, of, a, fluid, into, a, crystalline, solid, breaks, continuous, translation, symmetry, each, point, in, the, fluid, has, the, same, properties, but, each, point, in, a, crystal, does, not, have, the, same, properties, unless, the, points, are, chosen, from, the, lattice, points, of, the, crystal, lattice, typically, the, high, temperature, phase, contains, more, symmetries, than, the, low, temperature, phase, due, to, spontaneous, symmetry, breaking, with, the, exception, of, certain, accidental, symmetries, e, g, the, formation, of, heavy, virtual, particles, which, only, occurs, at, low, temperatures, an, order, parameter, is, a, measure, of, the, degree, of, order, across, the, boundaries, in, a, phase, transition, system, it, normally, ranges, between, zero, in, one, phase, usually, above, the, critical, point, and, nonzero, in, the, other, at, the, critical, point, the, order, parameter, susceptibility, will, usually, diverge, an, example, of, an, order, parameter, is, the, net, magnetization, in, a, ferromagnetic, system, undergoing, a, phase, transition, for, liquid, gas, transitions, the, order, parameter, is, the, difference, of, the, densities, from, a, theoretical, perspective, order, parameters, arise, from, symmetry, breaking, when, this, happens, one, needs, to, introduce, one, or, more, extra, variables, to, describe, the, state, of, the, system, for, example, in, the, ferromagnetic, phase, one, must, provide, the, net, magnetization, whose, direction, was, spontaneously, chosen, when, the, system, cooled, below, the, curie, point, however, note, that, order, parameters, can, also, be, defined, for, non, symmetry, breaking, transitions, some, phase, transitions, such, as, superconducting, and, ferromagnetic, can, have, order, parameters, for, more, than, one, degree, of, freedom, in, such, phases, the, order, parameter, may, take, the, form, of, a, complex, number, a, vector, or, even, a, tensor, the, magnitude, of, which, goes, to, zero, at, the, phase, transition, there, also, exist, dual, descriptions, of, phase, transitions, in, terms, of, disorder, parameters, these, indicate, the, presence, of, line, like, excitations, such, as, vortex, or, defect, lines, symmetry, breaking, phase, transitions, play, an, important, role, in, cosmology, as, the, universe, expanded, and, cooled, the, vacuum, underwent, a, series, of, symmetry, breaking, phase, transitions, for, example, the, electroweak, transition, broke, the, su, 2, u, 1, symmetry, of, the, electroweak, field, into, the, u, 1, symmetry, of, the, present, day, electromagnetic, field, this, transition, is, important, to, explain, the, asymmetry, between, the, amount, of, matter, and, antimatter, in, the, present, day, universe, according, to, electroweak, baryogenesis, theory, progressive, phase, transitions, in, an, expanding, universe, are, implicated, in, the, development, of, order, in, the, universe, as, is, illustrated, by, the, work, of, eric, chaisson, and, david, layzer, see, also, relational, order, theories, and, order, and, disorder, continuous, phase, transitions, are, easier, to, study, than, first, order, transitions, due, to, the, absence, of, latent, heat, and, they, have, been, discovered, to, have, many, interesting, properties, the, phenomena, associated, with, continuous, phase, transitions, are, called, critical, phenomena, due, to, their, association, with, critical, points, continuous, phase, transitions, can, be, characterized, by, parameters, known, as, critical, exponents, the, most, important, one, is, perhaps, the, exponent, describing, the, divergence, of, the, thermal, correlation, length, by, approaching, the, transition, for, instance, let, us, examine, the, behavior, of, the, heat, capacity, near, such, a, transition, we, vary, the, temperature, t, of, the, system, while, keeping, all, the, other, thermodynamic, variables, fixed, and, find, that, the, transition, occurs, at, some, critical, temperature, t, c, when, t, is, near, t, c, the, heat, capacity, c, typically, has, a, power, law, behavior, the, heat, capacity, of, amorphous, materials, has, such, a, behaviour, near, the, glass, transition, temperature, where, the, universal, critical, exponent, 0, 59, a, similar, behavior, but, with, the, exponent, instead, of, applies, for, the, correlation, length, the, exponent, is, positive, this, is, different, with, its, actual, value, depends, on, the, type, of, phase, transition, we, are, considering, the, critical, exponents, are, not, necessarily, the, same, above, and, below, the, critical, temperature, when, a, continuous, symmetry, is, explicitly, broken, down, to, a, discrete, symmetry, by, irrelevant, in, the, renormalization, group, sense, anisotropies, then, some, exponents, such, as, displaystyle, gamma, the, exponent, of, the, susceptibility, are, not, identical, for, 1, 0, the, heat, capacity, has, a, kink, at, the, transition, temperature, this, is, the, behavior, of, liquid, helium, at, the, lambda, transition, from, a, normal, state, to, the, superfluid, state, for, which, experiments, have, found, 0, 013, 0, 003, at, least, one, experiment, was, performed, in, the, zero, gravity, conditions, of, an, orbiting, satellite, to, minimize, pressure, differences, in, the, sample, this, experimental, value, of, agrees, with, theoretical, predictions, based, on, variational, perturbation, theory, for, 0, 1, the, heat, capacity, diverges, at, the, transition, temperature, though, since, 1, the, enthalpy, stays, finite, an, example, of, such, behavior, is, the, 3d, ferromagnetic, phase, transition, in, the, three, dimensional, ising, model, for, uniaxial, magnets, detailed, theoretical, studies, have, yielded, the, exponent, 0, 110, some, model, systems, do, not, obey, a, power, law, behavior, for, example, mean, field, theory, predicts, a, finite, discontinuity, of, the, heat, capacity, at, the, transition, temperature, and, the, two, dimensional, ising, model, has, a, logarithmic, divergence, however, these, systems, are, limiting, cases, and, an, exception, to, the, rule, real, phase, transitions, exhibit, power, law, behavior, several, other, critical, exponents, and, are, defined, examining, the, power, law, behavior, of, a, measurable, physical, quantity, near, the, phase, transition, exponents, are, related, by, scaling, relations, such, as, it, can, be, shown, that, there, are, only, two, independent, exponents, e, g, and, it, is, a, remarkable, fact, that, phase, transitions, arising, in, different, systems, often, possess, the, same, set, of, critical, exponents, this, phenomenon, is, known, as, universality, for, example, the, critical, exponents, at, the, liquid, gas, critical, point, have, been, found, to, be, independent, of, the, chemical, composition, of, the, fluid, more, impressively, but, understandably, from, above, they, are, an, exact, match, for, the, critical, exponents, of, the, ferromagnetic, phase, transition, in, uniaxial, magnets, such, systems, are, said, to, be, in, the, same, universality, class, universality, is, a, prediction, of, the, renormalization, group, theory, of, phase, transitions, which, states, that, the, thermodynamic, properties, of, a, system, near, a, phase, transition, depend, only, on, a, small, number, of, features, such, as, dimensionality, and, symmetry, and, are, insensitive, to, the, underlying, microscopic, properties, of, the, system, again, the, divergence, of, the, correlation, length, is, the, essential, point, there, are, also, other, critical, phenomena, e, g, besides, static, functions, there, is, also, critical, dynamics, as, a, consequence, at, a, phase, transition, one, may, observe, critical, slowing, down, or, speeding, up, connected, to, the, previous, phenomenon, is, also, the, phenomenon, of, enhanced, fluctuations, before, the, phase, transition, as, a, consequence, of, lower, degree, of, stability, of, the, initial, phase, of, the, system, the, large, static, universality, classes, of, a, continuous, phase, transition, split, into, smaller, dynamic, universality, classes, in, addition, to, the, critical, exponents, there, are, also, universal, relations, for, certain, static, or, dynamic, functions, of, the, magnetic, fields, and, temperature, differences, from, the, critical, value, phase, transitions, play, many, important, roles, in, biological, systems, examples, include, the, lipid, bilayer, formation, the, coil, globule, transition, in, the, process, of, protein, folding, and, dna, melting, liquid, crystal, like, transitions, in, the, process, of, dna, condensation, and, cooperative, ligand, binding, to, dna, and, proteins, with, the, character, of, phase, transition, in, biological, membranes, gel, to, liquid, crystalline, phase, transitions, play, a, critical, role, in, physiological, functioning, of, biomembranes, in, gel, phase, due, to, low, fluidity, of, membrane, lipid, fatty, acyl, chains, membrane, proteins, have, restricted, movement, and, thus, are, restrained, in, exercise, of, their, physiological, role, plants, depend, critically, on, photosynthesis, by, chloroplast, thylakoid, membranes, which, are, exposed, cold, environmental, temperatures, thylakoid, membranes, retain, innate, fluidity, even, at, relatively, low, temperatures, because, of, high, degree, of, fatty, acyl, disorder, allowed, by, their, high, content, of, linolenic, acid, 18, carbon, chain, with, 3, double, bonds, gel, to, liquid, crystalline, phase, transition, temperature, of, biological, membranes, can, be, determined, by, many, techniques, including, calorimetry, fluorescence, spin, label, electron, paramagnetic, resonance, and, nmr, by, recording, measurements, of, the, concerned, parameter, by, at, series, of, sample, temperatures, a, simple, method, for, its, determination, from, 13, c, nmr, line, intensities, has, also, been, proposed, it, has, been, proposed, that, some, biological, systems, might, lie, near, critical, points, examples, include, neural, networks, in, the, salamander, retina, bird, flocks, gene, expression, networks, in, drosophila, and, protein, folding, however, it, is, not, clear, whether, or, not, alternative, reasons, could, explain, some, of, the, phenomena, supporting, arguments, for, criticality, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, biological, organisms, share, two, key, properties, of, phase, transitions, the, change, of, macroscopic, behavior, and, the, coherence, of, a, system, at, a, critical, point, phase, transitions, are, prominent, feature, of, motor, behavior, in, biological, systems, spontaneous, gait, transitions, as, well, as, fatigue, induced, motor, task, disengagements, show, typical, critical, behavior, as, an, intimation, of, the, sudden, qualitative, change, of, the, previously, stable, motor, behavioral, pattern, the, characteristic, feature, of, second, order, phase, transitions, is, the, appearance, of, fractals, in, some, scale, free, properties, it, has, long, been, known, that, protein, globules, are, shaped, by, interactions, with, water, there, are, 20, amino, acids, that, form, side, groups, on, protein, peptide, chains, range, from, hydrophilic, to, hydrophobic, causing, the, former, to, lie, near, the, globular, surface, while, the, latter, lie, closer, to, the, globular, center, twenty, fractals, were, discovered, in, solvent, associated, surface, areas, of, 5000, protein, segments, the, existence, of, these, fractals, proves, that, proteins, function, near, critical, points, of, second, order, phase, transitions, in, groups, of, organisms, in, stress, when, approaching, critical, transitions, correlations, tend, to, increase, while, at, the, same, time, fluctuations, also, increase, this, effect, is, supported, by, many, experiments, and, observations, of, groups, of, people, mice, trees, and, grassy, plants, phase, transitions, have, been, hypothesised, to, occur, in, social, systems, viewed, as, dynamical, systems, a, hypothesis, proposed, in, the, 1990s, and, 2000s, in, the, context, of, peace, and, armed, conflict, is, that, when, a, conflict, that, is, non, violent, shifts, to, a, phase, of, armed, conflict, this, is, a, phase, transition, from, latent, to, manifest, phases, within, the, dynamical, system, 49, a, variety, of, methods, are, applied, for, studying, the, various, effects, selected, examples, are, media, related, to, phase, changes, at, wikimedia,
