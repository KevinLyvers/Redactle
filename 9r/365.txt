calcium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, ca, and, atomic, number, 20, as, an, alkaline, earth, metal, calcium, is, a, reactive, metal, that, forms, a, dark, oxide, nitride, layer, when, exposed, to, air, its, physical, and, chemical, properties, are, most, similar, to, its, heavier, homologues, strontium, and, barium, it, is, the, fifth, most, abundant, element, in, earth, s, crust, and, the, third, most, abundant, metal, after, iron, and, aluminium, the, most, common, calcium, compound, on, earth, is, calcium, carbonate, found, in, limestone, and, the, fossilised, remnants, of, early, sea, life, gypsum, anhydrite, fluorite, and, apatite, are, also, sources, of, calcium, the, name, derives, from, latin, calx, lime, which, was, obtained, from, heating, limestone, some, calcium, compounds, were, known, to, the, ancients, though, their, chemistry, was, unknown, until, the, seventeenth, century, pure, calcium, was, isolated, in, 1808, via, electrolysis, of, its, oxide, by, humphry, davy, who, named, the, element, calcium, compounds, are, widely, used, in, many, industries, in, foods, and, pharmaceuticals, for, calcium, supplementation, in, the, paper, industry, as, bleaches, as, components, in, cement, and, electrical, insulators, and, in, the, manufacture, of, soaps, on, the, other, hand, the, metal, in, pure, form, has, few, applications, due, to, its, high, reactivity, still, in, small, quantities, it, is, often, used, as, an, alloying, component, in, steelmaking, and, sometimes, as, a, calcium, lead, alloy, in, making, automotive, batteries, calcium, is, the, most, abundant, metal, and, the, fifth, most, abundant, element, in, the, human, body, as, electrolytes, calcium, ions, ca, 2, play, a, vital, role, in, the, physiological, and, biochemical, processes, of, organisms, and, cells, in, signal, transduction, pathways, where, they, act, as, a, second, messenger, in, neurotransmitter, release, from, neurons, in, contraction, of, all, muscle, cell, types, as, cofactors, in, many, enzymes, and, in, fertilization, calcium, ions, outside, cells, are, important, for, maintaining, the, potential, difference, across, excitable, cell, membranes, protein, synthesis, and, bone, formation, calcium, is, a, very, ductile, silvery, metal, sometimes, described, as, pale, yellow, whose, properties, are, very, similar, to, the, heavier, elements, in, its, group, strontium, barium, and, radium, a, calcium, atom, has, twenty, electrons, with, electron, configuration, 4s, 2, like, the, other, elements, placed, in, group, 2, of, the, periodic, table, calcium, has, two, valence, electrons, in, the, outermost, s, orbital, which, are, very, easily, lost, in, chemical, reactions, to, form, a, dipositive, ion, with, the, stable, electron, configuration, of, a, noble, gas, in, this, case, argon, hence, calcium, is, almost, always, divalent, in, its, compounds, which, are, usually, ionic, hypothetical, univalent, salts, of, calcium, would, be, stable, with, respect, to, their, elements, but, not, to, disproportionation, to, the, divalent, salts, and, calcium, metal, because, the, enthalpy, of, formation, of, mx, 2, is, much, higher, than, those, of, the, hypothetical, mx, this, occurs, because, of, the, much, greater, lattice, energy, afforded, by, the, more, highly, charged, ca, 2, cation, compared, to, the, hypothetical, ca, cation, calcium, strontium, barium, and, radium, are, always, considered, to, be, alkaline, earth, metals, the, lighter, beryllium, and, magnesium, also, in, group, 2, of, the, periodic, table, are, often, included, as, well, nevertheless, beryllium, and, magnesium, differ, significantly, from, the, other, members, of, the, group, in, their, physical, and, chemical, behavior, they, behave, more, like, aluminium, and, zinc, respectively, and, have, some, of, the, weaker, metallic, character, of, the, post, transition, metals, which, is, why, the, traditional, definition, of, the, term, alkaline, earth, metal, excludes, them, calcium, metal, melts, at, 842, c, and, boils, at, 1494, c, these, values, are, higher, than, those, for, magnesium, and, strontium, the, neighbouring, group, 2, metals, it, crystallises, in, the, face, centered, cubic, arrangement, like, strontium, and, barium, above, 443, c, 716, k, it, changes, to, a, body, centered, cubic, its, density, of, 1, 526, g, cm, 3, at, 20, c, is, the, lowest, in, its, group, calcium, is, harder, than, lead, but, can, be, cut, with, a, knife, with, effort, while, calcium, is, a, poorer, conductor, of, electricity, than, copper, or, aluminium, by, volume, it, is, a, better, conductor, by, mass, than, both, due, to, its, very, low, density, while, calcium, is, infeasible, as, a, conductor, for, most, terrestrial, applications, as, it, reacts, quickly, with, atmospheric, oxygen, its, use, as, such, in, space, has, been, considered, the, chemistry, of, calcium, is, that, of, a, typical, heavy, alkaline, earth, metal, for, example, calcium, spontaneously, reacts, with, water, more, quickly, than, magnesium, and, less, quickly, than, strontium, to, produce, calcium, hydroxide, and, hydrogen, gas, it, also, reacts, with, the, oxygen, and, nitrogen, in, air, to, form, a, mixture, of, calcium, oxide, and, calcium, nitride, when, finely, divided, it, spontaneously, burns, in, air, to, produce, the, nitride, bulk, calcium, is, less, reactive, it, quickly, forms, a, hydration, coating, in, moist, air, but, below, 30, relative, humidity, it, may, be, stored, indefinitely, at, room, temperature, besides, the, simple, oxide, cao, calcium, peroxide, cao, 2, can, be, made, by, direct, oxidation, of, calcium, metal, under, a, high, pressure, of, oxygen, and, there, is, some, evidence, for, a, yellow, superoxide, ca, o, 2, 2, calcium, hydroxide, ca, oh, 2, is, a, strong, base, though, not, as, strong, as, the, hydroxides, of, strontium, barium, or, the, alkali, metals, all, four, dihalides, of, calcium, are, known, calcium, carbonate, caco, 3, and, calcium, sulfate, caso, 4, are, particularly, abundant, minerals, like, strontium, and, barium, as, well, as, the, alkali, metals, and, the, divalent, lanthanides, europium, and, ytterbium, calcium, metal, dissolves, directly, in, liquid, ammonia, to, give, a, dark, blue, solution, due, to, the, large, size, of, the, calcium, ion, ca, 2, high, coordination, numbers, are, common, up, to, 24, in, some, intermetallic, compounds, such, as, cazn, 13, calcium, is, readily, complexed, by, oxygen, chelates, such, as, edta, and, polyphosphates, which, are, useful, in, analytic, chemistry, and, removing, calcium, ions, from, hard, water, in, the, absence, of, steric, hindrance, smaller, group, 2, cations, tend, to, form, stronger, complexes, but, when, large, polydentate, macrocycles, are, involved, the, trend, is, reversed, though, calcium, is, in, the, same, group, as, magnesium, and, organomagnesium, compounds, are, very, widely, used, throughout, chemistry, organocalcium, compounds, are, not, similarly, widespread, because, they, are, more, difficult, to, make, and, more, reactive, though, they, have, recently, been, investigated, as, possible, catalysts, organocalcium, compounds, tend, to, be, more, similar, to, organoytterbium, compounds, due, to, the, similar, ionic, radii, of, yb, 2, 102, pm, and, ca, 2, 100, pm, most, of, these, compounds, can, only, be, prepared, at, low, temperatures, bulky, ligands, tend, to, favor, stability, for, example, calcium, di, cyclopentadienyl, ca, c, 5, h, 5, 2, must, be, made, by, directly, reacting, calcium, metal, with, mercurocene, or, cyclopentadiene, itself, replacing, the, c, 5, h, 5, ligand, with, the, bulkier, c, 5, ch, 3, 5, ligand, on, the, other, hand, increases, the, compound, s, solubility, volatility, and, kinetic, stability, natural, calcium, is, a, mixture, of, five, stable, isotopes, 40, ca, 42, ca, 43, ca, 44, ca, and, 46, ca, and, one, isotope, with, a, half, life, so, long, that, it, is, for, all, practical, purposes, stable, 48, ca, with, a, half, life, of, about, 4, 3, 10, 19, years, calcium, is, the, first, lightest, element, to, have, six, naturally, occurring, isotopes, by, far, the, most, common, isotope, of, calcium, in, nature, is, 40, ca, which, makes, up, 96, 941, of, all, natural, calcium, it, is, produced, in, the, silicon, burning, process, from, fusion, of, alpha, particles, and, is, the, heaviest, stable, nuclide, with, equal, proton, and, neutron, numbers, its, occurrence, is, also, supplemented, slowly, by, the, decay, of, primordial, 40, k, adding, another, alpha, particle, leads, to, unstable, 44, ti, which, decays, via, two, successive, electron, captures, to, stable, 44, ca, this, makes, up, 2, 806, of, all, natural, calcium, and, is, the, second, most, common, isotope, the, other, four, natural, isotopes, 42, ca, 43, ca, 46, ca, and, 48, ca, are, significantly, rarer, each, comprising, less, than, 1, of, all, natural, calcium, the, four, lighter, isotopes, are, mainly, products, of, the, oxygen, burning, and, silicon, burning, processes, leaving, the, two, heavier, ones, to, be, produced, via, neutron, capture, processes, 46, ca, is, mostly, produced, in, a, hot, s, process, as, its, formation, requires, a, rather, high, neutron, flux, to, allow, short, lived, 45, ca, to, capture, a, neutron, 48, ca, is, produced, by, electron, capture, in, the, r, process, in, type, ia, supernovae, where, high, neutron, excess, and, low, enough, entropy, ensures, its, survival, 46, ca, and, 48, ca, are, the, first, classically, stable, nuclides, with, a, 6, neutron, or, 8, neutron, excess, respectively, although, extremely, neutron, rich, for, such, a, light, element, 48, ca, is, very, stable, because, it, is, a, doubly, magic, nucleus, having, 20, protons, and, 28, neutrons, arranged, in, closed, shells, its, beta, decay, to, 48, sc, is, very, hindered, because, of, the, gross, mismatch, of, nuclear, spin, 48, ca, has, zero, nuclear, spin, being, even, even, while, 48, sc, has, spin, 6, so, the, decay, is, forbidden, by, the, conservation, of, angular, momentum, while, two, excited, states, of, 48, sc, are, available, for, decay, as, well, they, are, also, forbidden, due, to, their, high, spins, as, a, result, when, 48, ca, does, decay, it, does, so, by, double, beta, decay, to, 48, ti, instead, being, the, lightest, nuclide, known, to, undergo, double, beta, decay, 46, ca, can, also, theoretically, undergo, double, beta, decay, to, 46, ti, but, this, has, never, been, observed, the, most, common, isotope, 40, ca, is, also, doubly, magic, and, could, undergo, double, electron, capture, to, 40, ar, but, this, has, likewise, never, been, observed, calcium, is, the, only, element, with, two, primordial, doubly, magic, isotopes, the, experimental, lower, limits, for, the, half, lives, of, 40, ca, and, 46, ca, are, 5, 9, 10, 21, years, and, 2, 8, 10, 15, years, respectively, apart, from, the, practically, stable, 48, ca, the, longest, lived, radioisotope, of, calcium, is, 41, ca, it, decays, by, electron, capture, to, stable, 41, k, with, a, half, life, of, about, 10, 5, years, its, existence, in, the, early, solar, system, as, an, extinct, radionuclide, has, been, inferred, from, excesses, of, 41, k, traces, of, 41, ca, also, still, exist, today, as, it, is, a, cosmogenic, nuclide, continuously, produced, through, neutron, activation, of, natural, 40, ca, many, other, calcium, radioisotopes, are, known, ranging, from, 35, ca, to, 60, ca, they, are, all, much, shorter, lived, than, 41, ca, the, most, stable, being, 45, ca, half, life, 163, days, and, 47, ca, half, life, 4, 54, days, isotopes, lighter, than, 42, ca, usually, undergo, beta, plus, decay, to, isotopes, of, potassium, and, those, heavier, than, 44, ca, usually, undergo, beta, minus, decay, to, isotopes, of, scandium, though, near, the, nuclear, drip, lines, proton, emission, and, neutron, emission, begin, to, be, significant, decay, modes, as, well, like, other, elements, a, variety, of, processes, alter, the, relative, abundance, of, calcium, isotopes, the, best, studied, of, these, processes, is, the, mass, dependent, fractionation, of, calcium, isotopes, that, accompanies, the, precipitation, of, calcium, minerals, such, as, calcite, aragonite, and, apatite, from, solution, lighter, isotopes, are, preferentially, incorporated, into, these, minerals, leaving, the, surrounding, solution, enriched, in, heavier, isotopes, at, a, magnitude, of, roughly, 0, 025, per, atomic, mass, unit, amu, at, room, temperature, mass, dependent, differences, in, calcium, isotope, composition, are, conventionally, expressed, by, the, ratio, of, two, isotopes, usually, 44, ca, 40, ca, in, a, sample, compared, to, the, same, ratio, in, a, standard, reference, material, 44, ca, 40, ca, varies, by, about, 1, 2, among, organisms, on, earth, calcium, compounds, were, known, for, millennia, though, their, chemical, makeup, was, not, understood, until, the, 17th, century, lime, as, a, building, material, and, as, plaster, for, statues, was, used, as, far, back, as, around, 7000, bc, the, first, dated, lime, kiln, dates, back, to, 2500, bc, and, was, found, in, khafajah, mesopotamia, about, the, same, time, dehydrated, gypsum, caso, 4, 2h, 2, o, was, being, used, in, the, great, pyramid, of, giza, this, material, would, later, be, used, for, the, plaster, in, the, tomb, of, tutankhamun, the, ancient, romans, instead, used, lime, mortars, made, by, heating, limestone, caco, 3, the, name, calcium, itself, derives, from, the, latin, word, calx, lime, vitruvius, noted, that, the, lime, that, resulted, was, lighter, than, the, original, limestone, attributing, this, to, the, boiling, of, the, water, in, 1755, joseph, black, proved, that, this, was, due, to, the, loss, of, carbon, dioxide, which, as, a, gas, had, not, been, recognised, by, the, ancient, romans, in, 1789, antoine, lavoisier, suspected, that, lime, might, be, an, oxide, of, a, fundamental, chemical, element, in, his, table, of, the, elements, lavoisier, listed, five, salifiable, earths, i, e, ores, that, could, be, made, to, react, with, acids, to, produce, salts, salis, salt, in, latin, chaux, calcium, oxide, magn, sie, magnesia, magnesium, oxide, baryte, barium, sulfate, alumine, alumina, aluminium, oxide, and, silice, silica, silicon, dioxide, about, these, elements, lavoisier, reasoned, we, are, probably, only, acquainted, as, yet, with, a, part, of, the, metallic, substances, existing, in, nature, as, all, those, which, have, a, stronger, affinity, to, oxygen, than, carbon, possesses, are, incapable, hitherto, of, being, reduced, to, a, metallic, state, and, consequently, being, only, presented, to, our, observation, under, the, form, of, oxyds, are, confounded, with, earths, it, is, extremely, probable, that, barytes, which, we, have, just, now, arranged, with, earths, is, in, this, situation, for, in, many, experiments, it, exhibits, properties, nearly, approaching, to, those, of, metallic, bodies, it, is, even, possible, that, all, the, substances, we, call, earths, may, be, only, metallic, oxyds, irreducible, by, any, hitherto, known, process, calcium, along, with, its, congeners, magnesium, strontium, and, barium, was, first, isolated, by, humphry, davy, in, 1808, following, the, work, of, j, ns, jakob, berzelius, and, magnus, martin, af, pontin, on, electrolysis, davy, isolated, calcium, and, magnesium, by, putting, a, mixture, of, the, respective, metal, oxides, with, mercury, ii, oxide, on, a, platinum, plate, which, was, used, as, the, anode, the, cathode, being, a, platinum, wire, partially, submerged, into, mercury, electrolysis, then, gave, calcium, mercury, and, magnesium, mercury, amalgams, and, distilling, off, the, mercury, gave, the, metal, however, pure, calcium, cannot, be, prepared, in, bulk, by, this, method, and, a, workable, commercial, process, for, its, production, was, not, found, until, over, a, century, later, at, 3, calcium, is, the, fifth, most, abundant, element, in, the, earth, s, crust, and, the, third, most, abundant, metal, behind, aluminium, and, iron, it, is, also, the, fourth, most, abundant, element, in, the, lunar, highlands, sedimentary, calcium, carbonate, deposits, pervade, the, earth, s, surface, as, fossilized, remains, of, past, marine, life, they, occur, in, two, forms, the, rhombohedral, calcite, more, common, and, the, orthorhombic, aragonite, forming, in, more, temperate, seas, minerals, of, the, first, type, include, limestone, dolomite, marble, chalk, and, iceland, spar, aragonite, beds, make, up, the, bahamas, the, florida, keys, and, the, red, sea, basins, corals, sea, shells, and, pearls, are, mostly, made, up, of, calcium, carbonate, among, the, other, important, minerals, of, calcium, are, gypsum, caso, 4, 2h, 2, o, anhydrite, caso, 4, fluorite, caf, 2, and, apatite, x, oh, cl, or, f, gre, the, major, producers, of, calcium, are, china, about, 10000, to, 12000, tonnes, per, year, russia, about, 6000, to, 8000, tonnes, per, year, and, the, united, states, about, 2000, to, 4000, tonnes, per, year, canada, and, france, are, also, among, the, minor, producers, in, 2005, about, 24000, tonnes, of, calcium, were, produced, about, half, of, the, world, s, extracted, calcium, is, used, by, the, united, states, with, about, 80, of, the, output, used, each, year, in, russia, and, china, davy, s, method, of, electrolysis, is, still, used, but, is, instead, applied, to, molten, calcium, chloride, since, calcium, is, less, reactive, than, strontium, or, barium, the, oxide, nitride, coating, that, results, in, air, is, stable, and, lathe, machining, and, other, standard, metallurgical, techniques, are, suitable, for, calcium, in, the, united, states, and, canada, calcium, is, instead, produced, by, reducing, lime, with, aluminium, at, high, temperatures, calcium, cycling, provides, a, link, between, tectonics, climate, and, the, carbon, cycle, in, the, simplest, terms, mountain, building, exposes, calcium, bearing, rocks, such, as, basalt, and, granodiorite, to, chemical, weathering, and, releases, ca, 2, into, surface, water, these, ions, are, transported, to, the, ocean, where, they, react, with, dissolved, co, 2, to, form, limestone, caco, 3, which, in, turn, settles, to, the, sea, floor, where, it, is, incorporated, into, new, rocks, dissolved, co, 2, along, with, carbonate, and, bicarbonate, ions, are, termed, dissolved, inorganic, carbon, dic, the, actual, reaction, is, more, complicated, and, involves, the, bicarbonate, ion, hco, 3, that, forms, when, co, 2, reacts, with, water, at, seawater, ph, at, seawater, ph, most, of, the, dissolved, co, 2, is, immediately, converted, back, into, hco, 3, the, reaction, results, in, a, net, transport, of, one, molecule, of, co, 2, from, the, ocean, atmosphere, into, the, lithosphere, the, result, is, that, each, ca, 2, ion, released, by, chemical, weathering, ultimately, removes, one, co, 2, molecule, from, the, surficial, system, atmosphere, ocean, soils, and, living, organisms, storing, it, in, carbonate, rocks, where, it, is, likely, to, stay, for, hundreds, of, millions, of, years, the, weathering, of, calcium, from, rocks, thus, scrubs, co, 2, from, the, ocean, and, atmosphere, exerting, a, strong, long, term, effect, on, climate, the, largest, use, of, metallic, calcium, is, in, steelmaking, due, to, its, strong, chemical, affinity, for, oxygen, and, sulfur, its, oxides, and, sulfides, once, formed, give, liquid, lime, aluminate, and, sulfide, inclusions, in, steel, which, float, out, on, treatment, these, inclusions, disperse, throughout, the, steel, and, become, small, and, spherical, improving, castability, cleanliness, and, general, mechanical, properties, calcium, is, also, used, in, maintenance, free, automotive, batteries, in, which, the, use, of, 0, 1, calcium, lead, alloys, instead, of, the, usual, antimony, lead, alloys, leads, to, lower, water, loss, and, lower, self, discharging, due, to, the, risk, of, expansion, and, cracking, aluminium, is, sometimes, also, incorporated, into, these, alloys, these, lead, calcium, alloys, are, also, used, in, casting, replacing, lead, antimony, alloys, calcium, is, also, used, to, strengthen, aluminium, alloys, used, for, bearings, for, the, control, of, graphitic, carbon, in, cast, iron, and, to, remove, bismuth, impurities, from, lead, calcium, metal, is, found, in, some, drain, cleaners, where, it, functions, to, generate, heat, and, calcium, hydroxide, that, saponifies, the, fats, and, liquefies, the, proteins, for, example, those, in, hair, that, block, drains, besides, metallurgy, the, reactivity, of, calcium, is, exploited, to, remove, nitrogen, from, high, purity, argon, gas, and, as, a, getter, for, oxygen, and, nitrogen, it, is, also, used, as, a, reducing, agent, in, the, production, of, chromium, zirconium, thorium, vanadium, and, uranium, it, can, also, be, used, to, store, hydrogen, gas, as, it, reacts, with, hydrogen, to, form, solid, calcium, hydride, from, which, the, hydrogen, can, easily, be, re, extracted, calcium, isotope, fractionation, during, mineral, formation, has, led, to, several, applications, of, calcium, isotopes, in, particular, the, 1997, observation, by, skulan, and, depaolo, that, calcium, minerals, are, isotopically, lighter, than, the, solutions, from, which, the, minerals, precipitate, is, the, basis, of, analogous, applications, in, medicine, and, in, paleoceanography, in, animals, with, skeletons, mineralized, with, calcium, the, calcium, isotopic, composition, of, soft, tissues, reflects, the, relative, rate, of, formation, and, dissolution, of, skeletal, mineral, in, humans, changes, in, the, calcium, isotopic, composition, of, urine, have, been, shown, to, be, related, to, changes, in, bone, mineral, balance, when, the, rate, of, bone, formation, exceeds, the, rate, of, bone, resorption, the, 44, ca, 40, ca, ratio, in, soft, tissue, rises, and, vice, versa, because, of, this, relationship, calcium, isotopic, measurements, of, urine, or, blood, may, be, useful, in, the, early, detection, of, metabolic, bone, diseases, like, osteoporosis, a, similar, system, exists, in, seawater, where, 44, ca, 40, ca, tends, to, rise, when, the, rate, of, removal, of, ca, 2, by, mineral, precipitation, exceeds, the, input, of, new, calcium, into, the, ocean, in, 1997, skulan, and, depaolo, presented, the, first, evidence, of, change, in, seawater, 44, ca, 40, ca, over, geologic, time, along, with, a, theoretical, explanation, of, these, changes, more, recent, papers, have, confirmed, this, observation, demonstrating, that, seawater, ca, 2, concentration, is, not, constant, and, that, the, ocean, is, never, in, a, steady, state, with, respect, to, calcium, input, and, output, this, has, important, climatological, implications, as, the, marine, calcium, cycle, is, closely, tied, to, the, carbon, cycle, many, calcium, compounds, are, used, in, food, as, pharmaceuticals, and, in, medicine, among, others, for, example, calcium, and, phosphorus, are, supplemented, in, foods, through, the, addition, of, calcium, lactate, calcium, diphosphate, and, tricalcium, phosphate, the, last, is, also, used, as, a, polishing, agent, in, toothpaste, and, in, antacids, calcium, lactobionate, is, a, white, powder, that, is, used, as, a, suspending, agent, for, pharmaceuticals, in, baking, calcium, phosphate, is, used, as, a, leavening, agent, calcium, sulfite, is, used, as, a, bleach, in, papermaking, and, as, a, disinfectant, calcium, silicate, is, used, as, a, reinforcing, agent, in, rubber, and, calcium, acetate, is, a, component, of, liming, rosin, and, is, used, to, make, metallic, soaps, and, synthetic, resins, calcium, is, on, the, world, health, organization, s, list, of, essential, medicines, foods, rich, in, calcium, include, dairy, products, such, as, yogurt, and, cheese, sardines, salmon, soy, products, kale, and, fortified, breakfast, cereals, because, of, concerns, for, long, term, adverse, side, effects, including, calcification, of, arteries, and, kidney, stones, both, the, u, s, institute, of, medicine, iom, and, the, european, food, safety, authority, efsa, set, tolerable, upper, intake, levels, uls, for, combined, dietary, and, supplemental, calcium, from, the, iom, people,

quantities, the, ca, 2, ion, acts, as, an, electrolyte, and, is, vital, to, the, health, of, the, muscular, circulatory, and, digestive, systems, is, indispensable, to, the, building, of, bone, in, the, form, of, hydroxyapatite, and, supports, synthesis, and, function, of, blood, cells, for, example, it, regulates, the, contraction, of, muscles, nerve, conduction, and, the, clotting, of, blood, as, a, result, intra, and, extracellular, calcium, levels, are, tightly, regulated, by, the, body, calcium, can, play, this, role, because, the, ca, 2, ion, forms, stable, coordination, complexes, with, many, organic, compounds, especially, proteins, it, also, forms, compounds, with, a, wide, range, of, solubilities, enabling, the, formation, of, the, skeleton, calcium, ions, may, be, complexed, by, proteins, through, binding, the, carboxyl, groups, of, glutamic, acid, or, aspartic, acid, residues, through, interacting, with, phosphorylated, serine, tyrosine, or, threonine, residues, or, by, being, chelated, by, carboxylated, amino, acid, residues, trypsin, a, digestive, enzyme, uses, the, first, method, osteocalcin, a, bone, matrix, protein, uses, the, third, some, other, bone, matrix, proteins, such, as, osteopontin, and, bone, sialoprotein, use, both, the, first, and, the, second, direct, activation, of, enzymes, by, binding, calcium, is, common, some, other, enzymes, are, activated, by, noncovalent, association, with, direct, calcium, binding, enzymes, calcium, also, binds, to, the, phospholipid, layer, of, the, cell, membrane, anchoring, proteins, associated, with, the, cell, surface, as, an, example, of, the, wide, range, of, solubility, of, calcium, compounds, monocalcium, phosphate, is, very, soluble, in, water, 85, of, extracellular, calcium, is, as, dicalcium, phosphate, with, a, solubility, of, 2, 00, mm, and, the, hydroxyapatite, of, bones, in, an, organic, matrix, is, tricalcium, phosphate, with, a, solubility, of, 1000, m, calcium, is, a, common, constituent, of, multivitamin, dietary, supplements, but, the, composition, of, calcium, complexes, in, supplements, may, affect, its, bioavailability, which, varies, by, solubility, of, the, salt, involved, calcium, citrate, malate, and, lactate, are, highly, bioavailable, while, the, oxalate, is, less, other, calcium, preparations, include, calcium, carbonate, calcium, citrate, malate, and, calcium, gluconate, the, intestine, absorbs, about, one, third, of, calcium, eaten, as, the, free, ion, and, plasma, calcium, level, is, then, regulated, by, the, kidneys, parathyroid, hormone, and, vitamin, d, promote, the, formation, of, bone, by, allowing, and, enhancing, the, deposition, of, calcium, ions, there, allowing, rapid, bone, turnover, without, affecting, bone, mass, or, mineral, content, when, plasma, calcium, levels, fall, cell, surface, receptors, are, activated, and, the, secretion, of, parathyroid, hormone, occurs, it, then, proceeds, to, stimulate, the, entry, of, calcium, into, the, plasma, pool, by, taking, it, from, targeted, kidney, gut, and, bone, cells, with, the, bone, forming, action, of, parathyroid, hormone, being, antagonised, by, calcitonin, whose, secretion, increases, with, increasing, plasma, calcium, levels, excess, intake, of, calcium, may, cause, hypercalcemia, however, because, calcium, is, absorbed, rather, inefficiently, by, the, intestines, high, serum, calcium, is, more, likely, caused, by, excessive, secretion, of, parathyroid, hormone, pth, or, possibly, by, excessive, intake, of, vitamin, d, both, of, which, facilitate, calcium, absorption, all, these, conditions, result, in, excess, calcium, salts, being, deposited, in, the, heart, blood, vessels, or, kidneys, symptoms, include, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory, loss, confusion, muscle, weakness, increased, urination, dehydration, and, metabolic, bone, disease, chronic, hypercalcaemia, typically, leads, to, calcification, of, soft, tissue, and, its, serious, consequences, for, example, calcification, can, cause, loss, of, elasticity, of, vascular, walls, and, disruption, of, laminar, blood, flow, and, thence, to, plaque, rupture, and, thrombosis, conversely, inadequate, calcium, or, vitamin, d, intakes, may, result, in, hypocalcemia, often, caused, also, by, inadequate, secretion, of, parathyroid, hormone, or, defective, pth, receptors, in, cells, symptoms, include, neuromuscular, excitability, which, potentially, causes, tetany, and, disruption, of, conductivity, in, cardiac, tissue, as, calcium, is, required, for, bone, development, many, bone, diseases, can, be, traced, to, the, organic, matrix, or, the, hydroxyapatite, in, molecular, structure, or, organization, of, bone, osteoporosis, is, a, reduction, in, mineral, content, of, bone, per, unit, volume, and, can, be, treated, by, supplementation, of, calcium, vitamin, d, and, bisphosphonates, inadequate, amounts, of, calcium, vitamin, d, or, phosphates, can, lead, to, softening, of, bones, called, osteomalacia, because, calcium, reacts, exothermically, with, water, and, acids, calcium, metal, coming, into, contact, with, bodily, moisture, results, in, severe, corrosive, irritation, when, swallowed, calcium, metal, has, the, same, effect, on, the, mouth, oesophagus, and, stomach, and, can, be, fatal, however, long, term,
