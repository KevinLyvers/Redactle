an, oxide, k, s, a, d, is, a, chemical, compound, containing, at, least, one, oxygen, atom, and, one, other, element, in, its, chemical, formula, oxide, itself, is, the, dianion, anion, bearing, a, net, charge, of, 2, of, oxygen, an, o, 2, ion, with, oxygen, in, the, oxidation, state, of, 2, most, of, the, earth, s, crust, consists, of, oxides, even, materials, considered, pure, elements, often, develop, an, oxide, coating, for, example, aluminium, foil, develops, a, thin, skin, of, al, 2, o, 3, called, a, passivation, layer, that, protects, the, foil, from, further, oxidation, oxides, are, extraordinarily, diverse, in, terms, of, stoichiometries, the, measurable, relationship, between, reactants, and, chemical, equations, of, an, equation, or, reaction, and, in, terms, of, the, structures, of, each, stoichiometry, most, elements, form, oxides, of, more, than, one, stoichiometry, a, well, known, example, is, carbon, monoxide, and, carbon, dioxide, this, applies, to, binary, oxides, that, is, compounds, containing, only, oxide, and, another, element, far, more, common, than, binary, oxides, are, oxides, of, more, complex, stoichiometries, such, complexity, can, arise, by, the, introduction, of, other, cations, a, positively, charged, ion, i, e, one, that, would, be, attracted, to, the, cathode, in, electrolysis, or, other, anions, a, negatively, charged, ion, iron, silicate, fe, 2, sio, 4, the, mineral, fayalite, is, one, of, many, examples, of, a, ternary, oxide, for, many, metal, oxides, the, possibilities, of, polymorphism, and, nonstoichiometry, exist, as, well, the, commercially, important, dioxides, of, titanium, exists, in, three, distinct, structures, for, example, many, metal, oxides, exist, in, various, nonstoichiometric, states, many, molecular, oxides, exist, with, diverse, ligands, as, well, for, simplicity, sake, most, of, this, article, focuses, on, binary, oxides, oxides, are, associated, with, all, elements, except, a, few, noble, gases, the, pathways, for, the, formation, of, this, diverse, family, of, compounds, are, correspondingly, numerous, many, metal, oxides, arise, by, decomposition, of, other, metal, compounds, e, g, carbonates, hydroxides, and, nitrates, in, the, making, of, calcium, oxide, calcium, carbonate, limestone, breaks, down, upon, heating, releasing, carbon, dioxide, the, reaction, of, elements, with, oxygen, in, air, is, a, key, step, in, corrosion, relevant, to, the, commercial, use, of, iron, especially, almost, all, elements, form, oxides, upon, heating, with, oxygen, atmosphere, for, example, zinc, powder, will, burn, in, air, to, give, zinc, oxide, the, production, of, metals, from, ores, often, involves, the, production, of, oxides, by, roasting, heating, metal, sulfide, minerals, in, air, in, this, way, mos, 2, molybdenite, is, converted, to, molybdenum, trioxide, the, precursor, to, virtually, all, molybdenum, compounds, noble, metals, such, as, gold, and, platinum, are, prized, because, they, resist, direct, chemical, combination, with, oxygen, important, and, prevalent, nonmetal, oxides, are, carbon, dioxide, and, carbon, monoxide, these, species, form, upon, full, or, partial, oxidation, of, carbon, or, hydrocarbons, with, a, deficiency, of, oxygen, the, monoxide, is, produced, with, excess, oxygen, the, dioxide, is, the, product, the, pathway, proceeds, by, the, intermediacy, of, carbon, monoxide, elemental, nitrogen, n, 2, is, difficult, to, convert, to, oxides, but, the, combustion, of, ammonia, gives, nitric, oxide, which, further, reacts, with, oxygen, these, reactions, are, practiced, in, the, production, of, nitric, acid, a, commodity, chemical, the, chemical, produced, on, the, largest, scale, industrially, is, sulfuric, acid, it, is, produced, by, the, oxidation, of, sulfur, to, sulfur, dioxide, which, is, separately, oxidized, to, sulfur, trioxide, finally, the, trioxide, is, converted, to, sulfuric, acid, by, a, hydration, reaction, oxides, have, a, range, of, structures, from, individual, molecules, to, polymeric, and, crystalline, structures, at, standard, conditions, oxides, may, range, from, solids, to, gases, solid, oxides, of, metals, usually, have, polymeric, structures, at, ambient, conditions, although, most, metal, oxides, are, crystalline, solids, many, non, metal, oxides, are, molecules, examples, of, molecular, oxides, are, carbon, dioxide, and, carbon, monoxide, all, simple, oxides, of, nitrogen, are, molecular, e, g, no, n, 2, o, no, 2, and, n, 2, o, 4, phosphorus, pentoxide, is, a, more, complex, molecular, oxide, with, a, deceptive, name, the, real, formula, being, p, 4, o, 10, tetroxides, are, rare, with, a, few, more, common, examples, being, ruthenium, tetroxide, osmium, tetroxide, and, xenon, tetroxide, reduction, of, metal, oxide, to, the, metal, is, practiced, on, a, large, scale, in, the, production, of, some, metals, many, metal, oxides, convert, to, metals, simply, by, heating, see, thermal, decomposition, for, example, silver, oxide, decomposes, at, 200, c, most, often, however, metals, oxides, are, reduced, by, a, chemical, reagent, a, common, and, cheap, reducing, agent, is, carbon, in, the, form, of, coke, the, most, prominent, example, is, that, of, iron, ore, smelting, many, reactions, are, involved, but, the, simplified, equation, is, usually, shown, as, some, metal, oxides, dissolve, in, the, presence, of, reducing, agents, which, can, include, organic, compounds, reductive, dissolution, of, ferric, oxides, is, integral, to, geochemical, phenomena, such, as, the, iron, cycle, because, the, m, o, bonds, are, typically, strong, metal, oxides, tend, to, be, insoluble, in, solvents, though, they, may, be, attacked, by, aqueous, acids, and, bases, dissolution, of, oxides, often, gives, oxyanions, adding, aqueous, base, to, p, 4, o, 10, gives, various, phosphates, adding, aqueous, base, to, moo, 3, gives, polyoxometalates, oxycations, are, rarer, some, examples, being, nitrosonium, no, vanadyl, vo, 2, and, uranyl, uo, 2, 2, of, course, many, compounds, are, known, with, both, oxides, and, other, groups, in, organic, chemistry, these, include, ketones, and, many, related, carbonyl, compounds, for, the, transition, metals, many, oxo, complexes, are, known, as, well, as, oxyhalides, the, chemical, formulas, of, the, oxides, of, the, chemical, elements, in, their, highest, oxidation, state, are, predictable, and, are, derived, from, the, number, of, valence, electrons, for, that, element, even, the, chemical, formula, of, o, 4, tetraoxygen, is, predictable, as, a, group, 16, element, one, exception, is, copper, for, which, the, highest, oxidation, state, oxide, is, copper, ii, oxide, and, not, copper, i, oxide, another, exception, is, fluoride, which, does, not, exist, as, one, might, expect, as, f, 2, o, 7, but, as, of, 2
