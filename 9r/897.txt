electricity, is, the, set, of, physical, phenomena, associated, with, the, presence, and, motion, of, matter, possessing, an, electric, charge, electricity, is, related, to, magnetism, both, being, part, of, the, phenomenon, of, electromagnetism, as, described, by, maxwell, s, equations, common, phenomena, are, related, to, electricity, including, lightning, static, electricity, electric, heating, electric, discharges, and, many, others, the, presence, of, either, a, positive, or, negative, electric, charge, produces, an, electric, field, the, motion, of, electric, charges, is, an, electric, current, and, produces, a, magnetic, field, in, most, applications, coulomb, s, law, determines, the, force, acting, on, an, electric, charge, electric, potential, is, the, work, done, to, move, an, electric, charge, from, one, point, to, another, within, an, electric, field, typically, measured, in, volts, electricity, plays, a, central, role, in, many, modern, technologies, serving, in, electric, power, where, electric, current, is, used, to, energise, equipment, and, in, electronics, dealing, with, electrical, circuits, involving, active, components, such, as, vacuum, tubes, transistors, diodes, and, integrated, circuits, and, associated, passive, interconnection, technologies, the, study, of, electrical, phenomena, dates, back, to, antiquity, with, theoretical, understanding, progressing, slowly, until, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, the, development, of, the, theory, of, electromagnetism, in, the, 19th, century, marked, significant, progress, leading, to, electricity, s, industrial, and, residential, application, by, electrical, engineers, by, the, century, s, end, this, rapid, expansion, in, electrical, technology, at, the, time, was, the, driving, force, behind, the, second, industrial, revolution, with, electricity, s, versatility, driving, transformations, in, both, industry, and, society, electricity, is, integral, to, applications, spanning, transport, heating, lighting, communications, and, computation, making, it, the, foundation, of, modern, industrial, society, long, before, any, knowledge, of, electricity, existed, people, were, aware, of, shocks, from, electric, fish, ancient, egyptian, texts, dating, from, 2750, bce, described, them, as, the, protectors, of, all, other, fish, electric, fish, were, again, reported, millennia, later, by, ancient, greek, roman, and, arabic, naturalists, and, physicians, several, ancient, writers, such, as, pliny, the, elder, and, scribonius, largus, attested, to, the, numbing, effect, of, electric, shocks, delivered, by, electric, catfish, and, electric, rays, and, knew, that, such, shocks, could, travel, along, conducting, objects, patients, with, ailments, such, as, gout, or, headache, were, directed, to, touch, electric, fish, in, the, hope, that, the, powerful, jolt, might, cure, them, ancient, cultures, around, the, mediterranean, knew, that, certain, objects, such, as, rods, of, amber, could, be, rubbed, with, cat, s, fur, to, attract, light, objects, like, feathers, thales, of, miletus, made, a, series, of, observations, on, static, electricity, around, 600, bce, from, which, he, believed, that, friction, rendered, amber, magnetic, in, contrast, to, minerals, such, as, magnetite, which, needed, no, rubbing, thales, was, incorrect, in, believing, the, attraction, was, due, to, a, magnetic, effect, but, later, science, would, prove, a, link, between, magnetism, and, electricity, according, to, a, controversial, theory, the, parthians, may, have, had, knowledge, of, electroplating, based, on, the, 1936, discovery, of, the, baghdad, battery, which, resembles, a, galvanic, cell, though, it, is, uncertain, whether, the, artifact, was, electrical, in, nature, electricity, would, remain, little, more, than, an, intellectual, curiosity, for, millennia, until, 1600, when, the, english, scientist, william, gilbert, wrote, de, magnete, in, which, he, made, a, careful, study, of, electricity, and, magnetism, distinguishing, the, lodestone, effect, from, static, electricity, produced, by, rubbing, amber, he, coined, the, neo, latin, word, electricus, of, amber, or, like, amber, from, elektron, the, greek, word, for, amber, to, refer, to, the, property, of, attracting, small, objects, after, being, rubbed, this, association, gave, rise, to, the, english, words, electric, and, electricity, which, made, their, first, appearance, in, print, in, thomas, browne, s, pseudodoxia, epidemica, of, 1646, further, work, was, conducted, in, the, 17th, and, early, 18th, centuries, by, otto, von, guericke, robert, boyle, stephen, gray, and, c, f, du, fay, later, in, the, 18th, century, benjamin, franklin, conducted, extensive, research, in, electricity, selling, his, possessions, to, fund, his, work, in, june, 1752, he, is, reputed, to, have, attached, a, metal, key, to, the, bottom, of, a, dampened, kite, string, and, flown, the, kite, in, a, storm, threatened, sky, a, succession, of, sparks, jumping, from, the, key, to, the, back, of, his, hand, showed, that, lightning, was, indeed, electrical, in, nature, he, also, explained, the, apparently, paradoxical, behavior, of, the, leyden, jar, as, a, device, for, storing, large, amounts, of, electrical, charge, in, terms, of, electricity, consisting, of, both, positive, and, negative, charges, in, 1775, hugh, williamson, reported, a, series, of, experiments, to, the, royal, society, on, the, shocks, delivered, by, the, electric, eel, that, same, year, the, surgeon, and, anatomist, john, hunter, described, the, structure, of, the, fish, s, electric, organs, in, 1791, luigi, galvani, published, his, discovery, of, bioelectromagnetics, demonstrating, that, electricity, was, the, medium, by, which, neurons, passed, signals, to, the, muscles, alessandro, volta, s, battery, or, voltaic, pile, of, 1800, made, from, alternating, layers, of, zinc, and, copper, provided, scientists, with, a, more, reliable, source, of, electrical, energy, than, the, electrostatic, machines, previously, used, the, recognition, of, electromagnetism, the, unity, of, electric, and, magnetic, phenomena, is, due, to, hans, christian, rsted, and, andr, marie, amp, re, in, 1819, 1820, michael, faraday, invented, the, electric, motor, in, 1821, and, georg, ohm, mathematically, analysed, the, electrical, circuit, in, 1827, electricity, and, magnetism, and, light, were, definitively, linked, by, james, clerk, maxwell, in, particular, in, his, on, physical, lines, of, force, in, 1861, and, 1862, 148, while, the, early, 19th, century, had, seen, rapid, progress, in, electrical, science, the, late, 19th, century, would, see, the, greatest, progress, in, electrical, engineering, through, such, people, as, alexander, graham, bell, ott, bl, thy, thomas, edison, galileo, ferraris, oliver, heaviside, nyos, jedlik, william, thomson, 1st, baron, kelvin, charles, algernon, parsons, werner, von, siemens, joseph, swan, reginald, fessenden, nikola, tesla, and, george, westinghouse, electricity, turned, from, a, scientific, curiosity, into, an, essential, tool, for, modern, life, in, 1887, heinrich, hertz, 843, 44, discovered, that, electrodes, illuminated, with, ultraviolet, light, create, electric, sparks, more, easily, in, 1905, albert, einstein, published, a, paper, that, explained, experimental, data, from, the, photoelectric, effect, as, being, the, result, of, light, energy, being, carried, in, discrete, quantized, packets, energising, electrons, this, discovery, led, to, the, quantum, revolution, einstein, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, in, 1921, for, his, discovery, of, the, law, of, the, photoelectric, effect, the, photoelectric, effect, is, also, employed, in, photocells, such, as, can, be, found, in, solar, panels, the, first, solid, state, device, was, the, cat, s, whisker, detector, first, used, in, the, 1900s, in, radio, receivers, a, whisker, like, wire, is, placed, lightly, in, contact, with, a, solid, crystal, such, as, a, germanium, crystal, to, detect, a, radio, signal, by, the, contact, junction, effect, in, a, solid, state, component, the, current, is, confined, to, solid, elements, and, compounds, engineered, specifically, to, switch, and, amplify, it, current, flow, can, be, understood, in, two, forms, as, negatively, charged, electrons, and, as, positively, charged, electron, deficiencies, called, holes, these, charges, and, holes, are, understood, in, terms, of, quantum, physics, the, building, material, is, most, often, a, crystalline, semiconductor, solid, state, electronics, came, into, its, own, with, the, emergence, of, transistor, technology, the, first, working, transistor, a, germanium, based, point, contact, transistor, was, invented, by, john, bardeen, and, walter, houser, brattain, at, bell, labs, in, 1947, followed, by, the, bipolar, junction, transistor, in, 1948, by, modern, convention, the, charge, carried, by, electrons, is, defined, as, negative, and, that, by, protons, is, positive, before, these, particles, were, discovered, benjamin, franklin, had, defined, a, positive, charge, as, being, the, charge, acquired, by, a, glass, rod, when, it, is, rubbed, with, a, silk, cloth, a, proton, by, definition, carries, a, charge, of, exactly, 1, 602, 176, 634, 10, 19, coulombs, this, value, is, also, defined, as, the, elementary, charge, no, object, can, have, a, charge, smaller, than, the, elementary, charge, and, any, amount, of, charge, an, object, may, carry, is, a, multiple, of, the, elementary, charge, an, electron, has, an, equal, negative, charge, i, e, 1, 602, 176, 634, 10, 19, coulombs, charge, is, possessed, not, just, by, matter, but, also, by, antimatter, each, antiparticle, bearing, an, equal, and, opposite, charge, to, its, corresponding, particle, the, presence, of, charge, gives, rise, to, an, electrostatic, force, charges, exert, a, force, on, each, other, an, effect, that, was, known, though, not, understood, in, antiquity, 457, a, lightweight, ball, suspended, by, a, fine, thread, can, be, charged, by, touching, it, with, a, glass, rod, that, has, itself, been, charged, by, rubbing, with, a, cloth, if, a, similar, ball, is, charged, by, the, same, glass, rod, it, is, found, to, repel, the, first, the, charge, acts, to, force, the, two, balls, apart, two, balls, that, are, charged, with, a, rubbed, amber, rod, also, repel, each, other, however, if, one, ball, is, charged, by, the, glass, rod, and, the, other, by, an, amber, rod, the, two, balls, are, found, to, attract, each, other, these, phenomena, were, investigated, in, the, late, eighteenth, century, by, charles, augustin, de, coulomb, who, deduced, that, charge, manifests, itself, in, two, opposing, forms, this, discovery, led, to, the, well, known, axiom, like, charged, objects, repel, and, opposite, charged, objects, attract, the, force, acts, on, the, charged, particles, themselves, hence, charge, has, a, tendency, to, spread, itself, as, evenly, as, possible, over, a, conducting, surface, the, magnitude, of, the, electromagnetic, force, whether, attractive, or, repulsive, is, given, by, coulomb, s, law, which, relates, the, force, to, the, product, of, the, charges, and, has, an, inverse, square, relation, to, the, distance, between, them, 35, the, electromagnetic, force, is, very, strong, second, only, in, strength, to, the, strong, interaction, but, unlike, that, force, it, operates, over, all, distances, in, comparison, with, the, much, weaker, gravitational, force, the, electromagnetic, force, pushing, two, electrons, apart, is, 10, 42, times, that, of, the, gravitational, attraction, pulling, them, together, charge, originates, from, certain, types, of, subatomic, particles, the, most, familiar, carriers, of, which, are, the, electron, and, proton, electric, charge, gives, rise, to, and, interacts, with, the, electromagnetic, force, one, of, the, four, fundamental, forces, of, nature, experiment, has, shown, charge, to, be, a, conserved, quantity, that, is, the, net, charge, within, an, electrically, isolated, system, will, always, remain, constant, regardless, of, any, changes, taking, place, within, that, system, within, the, system, charge, may, be, transferred, between, bodies, either, by, direct, contact, or, by, passing, along, a, conducting, material, such, as, a, wire, 2, 5, the, informal, term, static, electricity, refers, to, the, net, presence, or, imbalance, of, charge, on, a, body, usually, caused, when, dissimilar, materials, are, rubbed, together, transferring, charge, from, one, to, the, other, charge, can, be, measured, by, a, number, of, means, an, early, instrument, being, the, gold, leaf, electroscope, which, although, still, in, use, for, classroom, demonstrations, has, been, superseded, by, the, electronic, electrometer, 2, 5, the, movement, of, electric, charge, is, known, as, an, electric, current, the, intensity, of, which, is, usually, measured, in, amperes, current, can, consist, of, any, moving, charged, particles, most, commonly, these, are, electrons, but, any, charge, in, motion, constitutes, a, current, electric, current, can, flow, through, some, things, electrical, conductors, but, will, not, flow, through, an, electrical, insulator, by, historical, convention, a, positive, current, is, defined, as, having, the, same, direction, of, flow, as, any, positive, charge, it, contains, or, to, flow, from, the, most, positive, part, of, a, circuit, to, the, most, negative, part, current, defined, in, this, manner, is, called, conventional, current, the, motion, of, negatively, charged, electrons, around, an, electric, circuit, one, of, the, most, familiar, forms, of, current, is, thus, deemed, positive, in, the, opposite, direction, to, that, of, the, electrons, however, depending, on, the, conditions, an, electric, current, can, consist, of, a, flow, of, charged, particles, in, either, direction, or, even, in, both, directions, at, once, the, positive, to, negative, convention, is, widely, used, to, simplify, this, situation, the, process, by, which, electric, current, passes, through, a, material, is, termed, electrical, conduction, and, its, nature, varies, with, that, of, the, charged, particles, and, the, material, through, which, they, are, travelling, examples, of, electric, currents, include, metallic, conduction, where, electrons, flow, through, a, conductor, such, as, metal, and, electrolysis, where, ions, charged, atoms, flow, through, liquids, or, through, plasmas, such, as, electrical, sparks, while, the, particles, themselves, can, move, quite, slowly, sometimes, with, an, average, drift, velocity, only, fractions, of, a, millimetre, per, second, 17, the, electric, field, that, drives, them, itself, propagates, at, close, to, the, speed, of, light, enabling, electrical, signals, to, pass, rapidly, along, wires, current, causes, several, observable, effects, which, historically, were, the, means, of, recognising, its, presence, that, water, could, be, decomposed, by, the, current, from, a, voltaic, pile, was, discovered, by, nicholson, and, carlisle, in, 1800, a, process, now, known, as, electrolysis, their, work, was, greatly, expanded, upon, by, michael, faraday, in, 1833, current, through, a, resistance, causes, localised, heating, an, effect, james, prescott, joule, studied, mathematically, in, 1840, 23, 24, one, of, the, most, important, discoveries, relating, to, current, was, made, accidentally, by, hans, christian, rsted, in, 1820, when, while, preparing, a, lecture, he, witnessed, the, current, in, a, wire, disturbing, the, needle, of, a, magnetic, compass, 370, he, had, discovered, electromagnetism, a, fundamental, interaction, between, electricity, and, magnetics, the, level, of, electromagnetic, emissions, generated, by, electric, arcing, is, high, enough, to, produce, electromagnetic, interference, which, can, be, detrimental, to, the, workings, of, adjacent, equipment, in, engineering, or, household, applications, current, is, often, described, as, being, either, direct, current, dc, or, alternating, current, ac, these, terms, refer, to, how, the, current, varies, in, time, direct, current, as, produced, by, example, from, a, battery, and, required, by, most, electronic, devices, is, a, unidirectional, flow, from, the, positive, part, of, a, circuit, to, the, negative, 11, if, as, is, most, common, this, flow, is, carried, by, electrons, they, will, be, travelling, in, the, opposite, direction, alternating, current, is, any, current, that, reverses, direction, repeatedly, almost, always, this, takes, the, form, of, a, sine, wave, 206, 07, alternating, current, thus, pulses, back, and, forth, within, a, conductor, without, the, charge, moving, any, net, distance, over, time, the, time, averaged, value, of, an, alternating, current, is, zero, but, it, delivers, energy, in, first, one, direction, and, then, the, reverse, alternating, current, is, affected, by, electrical, properties, that, are, not, observed, under, steady, state, direct, current, such, as, inductance, and, capacitance, 223, 25, these, properties, however, can, become, important, when, circuitry, is, subjected, to, transients, such, as, when, first, energised, the, concept, of, the, electric, field, was, introduced, by, michael, faraday, an, electric, field, is, created, by, a, charged, body, in, the, space, that, surrounds, it, and, results, in, a, force, exerted, on, any, other, charges, placed, within, the, field, the, electric, field, acts, between, two, charges, in, a, similar, manner, to, the, way, that, the, gravitational, field, acts, between, two, masses, and, like, it, extends, towards, infinity, and, shows, an, inverse, square, relationship, with, distance, however, there, is, an, important, difference, gravity, always, acts, in, attraction, drawing, two, masses, together, while, the, electric, field, can, result, in, either, attraction, or, repulsion, since, large, bodies, such, as, planets, generally, carry, no, net, charge, the, electric, field, at, a, distance, is, usually, zero, thus, gravity, is, the, dominant, force, at, distance, in, the, universe, despite, being, much, weaker, an, electric, field, generally, varies, in, space, and, its, strength, at, any, one, point, is, defined, as, the, force, per, unit, charge, that, would, be, felt, by, a, stationary, negligible, charge, if, placed, at, that, point, 469, 70, the, conceptual, charge, termed, a, test, charge, must, be, vanishingly, small, to, prevent, its, own, electric, field, disturbing, the, main, field, and, must, also, be, stationary, to, prevent, the, effect, of, magnetic, fields, as, the, electric, field, is, defined, in, terms, of, force, and, force, is, a, vector, having, both, magnitude, and, direction, it, follows, that, an, electric, field, is, a, vector, field, 469, 70, the, study, of, electric, fields, created, by, stationary, charges, is, called, electrostatics, the, field, may, be, visualised, by, a, set, of, imaginary, lines, whose, direction, at, any, point, is, the, same, as, that, of, the, field, this, concept, was, introduced, by, faraday, whose, term, lines, of, force, still, sometimes, sees, use, the, field, lines, are, the, paths, that, a, point, positive, charge, would, seek, to, make, as, it, was, forced, to, move, within, the, field, they, are, however, an, imaginary, concept, with, no, physical, existence, and, the, field, permeates, all, the, intervening, space, between, the, lines, field, lines, emanating, from, stationary, charges, have, several, key, properties, first, that, they, originate, at, positive, charges, and, terminate, at, negative, charges, second, that, they, must, enter, any, good, conductor, at, right, angles, and, third, that, they, may, never, cross, nor, close, in, on, themselves, 479, a, hollow, conducting, body, carries, all, its, charge, on, its, outer, surface, the, field, is, therefore, 0, at, all, places, inside, the, body, 88, this, is, the, operating, principal, of, the, faraday, cage, a, conducting, metal, shell, which, isolates, its, interior, from, outside, electrical, effects, the, principles, of, electrostatics, are, important, when, designing, items, of, high, voltage, equipment, there, is, a, finite, limit, to, the, electric, field, strength, that, may, be, withstood, by, any, medium, beyond, this, point, electrical, breakdown, occurs, and, an, electric, arc, causes, flashover, between, the, charged, parts, air, for, example, tends, to, arc, across, small, gaps, at, electric, field, strengths, which, exceed, 30, kv, per, centimetre, over, larger, gaps, its, breakdown, strength, is, weaker, perhaps, 1, kv, per, centimetre, 2, the, most, visible, natural, occurrence, of, this, is, lightning, caused, when, charge, becomes, separated, in, the, clouds, by, rising, columns, of, air, and, raises, the, electric, field, in, the, air, to, greater, than, it, can, withstand, the, voltage, of, a, large, lightning, cloud, may, be, as, high, as, 100, mv, and, have, discharge, energies, as, great, as, 250, kwh, 201, 02, the, field, strength, is, greatly, affected, by, nearby, conducting, objects, and, it, is, particularly, intense, when, it, is, forced, to, curve, around, sharply, pointed, objects, this, principle, is, exploited, in, the, lightning, conductor, the, sharp, spike, of, which, acts, to, encourage, the, lightning, strike, to, develop, there, rather, than, to, the, building, it, serves, to, protect, 155, the, concept, of, electric, potential, is, closely, linked, to, that, of, the, electric, field, a, small, charge, placed, within, an, electric, field, experiences, a, force, and, to, have, brought, that, charge, to, that, point, against, the, force, requires, work, the, electric, potential, at, any, point, is, defined, as, the, energy, required, to, bring, a, unit, test, charge, from, an, infinite, distance, slowly, to, that, point, it, is, usually, measured, in, volts, and, one, volt, is, the, potential, for, which, one, joule, of, work, must, be, expended, to, bring, a, charge, of, one, coulomb, from, infinity, 494, 98, this, definition, of, potential, while, formal, has, little, practical, application, and, a, more, useful, concept, is, that, of, electric, potential, difference, and, is, the, energy, required, to, move, a, unit, charge, between, two, specified, points, an, electric, field, has, the, special, property, that, it, is, conservative, which, means, that, the, path, taken, by, the, test, charge, is, irrelevant, all, paths, between, two, specified, points, expend, the, same, energy, and, thus, a, unique, value, for, potential, difference, may, be, stated, 494, 98, the, volt, is, so, strongly, identified, as, the, unit, of, choice, for, measurement, and, description, of, electric, potential, difference, that, the, term, voltage, sees, greater, everyday, usage, for, practical, purposes, it, is, useful, to, define, a, common, reference, point, to, which, potentials, may, be, expressed, and, compared, while, this, could, be, at, infinity, a, much, more, useful, reference, is, the, earth, itself, which, is, assumed, to, be, at, the, same, potential, everywhere, this, reference, point, naturally, takes, the, name, earth, or, ground, earth, is, assumed, to, be, an, infinite, source, of, equal, amounts, of, positive, and, negative, charge, and, is, therefore, electrically, uncharged, and, unchargeable, electric, potential, is, a, scalar, quantity, that, is, it, has, only, magnitude, and, not, direction, it, may, be, viewed, as, analogous, to, height, just, as, a, released, object, will, fall, through, a, difference, in, heights, caused, by, a, gravitational, field, so, a, charge, will, fall, across, the, voltage, caused, by, an, electric, field, as, relief, maps, show, contour, lines, marking, points, of, equal, height, a, set, of, lines, marking, points, of, equal, potential, known, as, equipotentials, may, be, drawn, around, an, electrostatically, charged, object, the, equipotentials, cross, all, lines, of, force, at, right, angles, they, must, also, lie, parallel, to, a, conductor, s, surface, since, otherwise, there, would, be, a, force, along, the, surface, of, the, conductor, that, would, move, the, charge, carriers, to, even, the, potential, across, the, surface, the, electric, field, was, formally, defined, as, the, force, exerted, per, unit, charge, but, the, concept, of, potential, allows, for, a, more, useful, and, equivalent, definition, the, electric, field, is, the, local, gradient, of, the, electric, potential, usually, expressed, in, volts, per, metre, the, vector, direction, of, the, field, is, the, line, of, greatest, slope, of, potential, and, where, the, equipotentials, lie, closest, together, 60, rsted, s, discovery, in, 1821, that, a, magnetic, field, existed, around, all, sides, of, a, wire, carrying, an, electric, current, indicated, that, there, was, a, direct, relationship, between, electricity, and, magnetism, moreover, the, interaction, seemed, different, from, gravitational, and, electrostatic, forces, the, two, forces, of, nature, then, known, the, force, on, the, compass, needle, did, not, direct, it, to, or, away, from, the, current, carrying, wire, but, acted, at, right, angles, to, it, 370, rsted, s, words, were, that, the, electric, conflict, acts, in, a, revolving, manner, the, force, also, depended, on, the, direction, of, the, current, for, if, the, flow, was, reversed, then, the, force, did, too, rsted, did, not, fully, understand, his, discovery, but, he, observed, the, effect, was, reciprocal, a, current, exerts, a, force, on, a, magnet, and, a, magnetic, field, exerts, a, force, on, a, current, the, phenomenon, was, further, investigated, by, amp, re, who, discovered, that, two, parallel, current, carrying, wires, exerted, a, force, upon, each, other, two, wires, conducting, currents, in, the, same, direction, are, attracted, to, each, other, while, wires, containing, currents, in, opposite, directions, are, forced, apart, the, interaction, is, mediated, by, the, magnetic, field, each, current, produces, and, forms, the, basis, for, the, international, definition, of, the, ampere, this, relationship, between, magnetic, fields, and, currents, is, extremely, important, for, it, led, to, michael, faraday, s, invention, of, the, electric, motor, in, 1821, faraday, s, homopolar, motor, consisted, of, a, permanent, magnet, sitting, in, a, pool, of, mercury, a, current, was, allowed, through, a, wire, suspended, from, a, pivot, above, the, magnet, and, dipped, into, the, mercury, the, magnet, exerted, a, tangential, force, on, the, wire, making, it, circle, around, the, magnet, for, as, long, as, the, current, was, maintained, experimentation, by, faraday, in, 1831, revealed, that, a, wire, moving, perpendicular, to, a, magnetic, field, developed, a, potential, difference, between, its, ends, further, analysis, of, this, process, known, as, electromagnetic, induction, enabled, him, to, state, the, principle, now, known, as, faraday, s, law, of, induction, that, the, potential, difference, induced, in, a, closed, circuit, is, proportional, to, the, rate, of, change, of, magnetic, flux, through, the, loop, exploitation, of, this, discovery, enabled, him, to, invent, the, first, electrical, generator, in, 1831, in, which, he, converted, the, mechanical, energy, of, a, rotating, copper, disc, to, electrical, energy, faraday, s, disc, was, inefficient, and, of, no, use, as, a, practical, generator, but, it, showed, the, possibility, of, generating, electric, power, using, magnetism, a, possibility, that, would, be, taken, up, by, those, that, followed, on, from, his, work, an, electric, circuit, is, an, interconnection, of, electric, components, such, that, electric, charge, is, made, to, flow, along, a, closed, path, a, circuit, usually, to, perform, some, useful, task, the, components, in, an, electric, circuit, can, take, many, forms, which, can, include, elements, such, as, resistors, capacitors, switches, transformers, and, electronics, electronic, circuits, contain, active, components, usually, semiconductors, and, typically, exhibit, non, linear, behaviour, requiring, complex, analysis, the, simplest, electric, components, are, those, that, are, termed, passive, and, linear, while, they, may, temporarily, store, energy, they, contain, no, sources, of, it, and, exhibit, linear, responses, to, stimuli, 15, 16, the, resistor, is, perhaps, the, simplest, of, passive, circuit, elements, as, its, name, suggests, it, resists, the, current, through, it, dissipating, its, energy, as, heat, the, resistance, is, a, consequence, of, the, motion, of, charge, through, a, conductor, in, metals, for, example, resistance, is, primarily, due, to, collisions, between, electrons, and, ions, ohm, s, law, is, a, basic, law, of, circuit, theory, stating, that, the, current, passing, through, a, resistance, is, directly, proportional, to, the, potential, difference, across, it, the, resistance, of, most, materials, is, relatively, constant, over, a, range, of, temperatures, and, currents, materials, under, these, conditions, are, known, as, ohmic, the, ohm, the, unit, of, resistance, was, named, in, honour, of, georg, ohm, and, is, symbolised, by, the, greek, letter, 1, is, the, resistance, that, will, produce, a, potential, difference, of, one, volt, in, response, to, a, current, of, one, amp, 30, 35, the, capacitor, is, a, development, of, the, leyden, jar, and, is, a, device, that, can, store, charge, and, thereby, storing, electrical, energy, in, the, resulting, field, it, consists, of, two, conducting, plates, separated, by, a, thin, insulating, dielectric, layer, in, practice, thin, metal, foils, are, coiled, together, increasing, the, surface, area, per, unit, volume, and, therefore, the, capacitance, the, unit, of, capacitance, is, the, farad, named, after, michael, faraday, and, given, the, symbol, f, one, farad, is, the, capacitance, that, develops, a, potential, difference, of, one, volt, when, it, stores, a, charge, of, one, coulomb, a, capacitor, connected, to, a, voltage, supply, initially, causes, a, current, as, it, accumulates, charge, this, current, will, however, decay, in, time, as, the, capacitor, fills, eventually, falling, to, zero, a, capacitor, will, therefore, not, permit, a, steady, state, current, but, instead, blocks, it, 216, 20, the, inductor, is, a, conductor, usually, a, coil, of, wire, that, stores, energy, in, a, magnetic, field, in, response, to, the, current, through, it, when, the, current, changes, the, magnetic, field, does, too, inducing, a, voltage, between, the, ends, of, the, conductor, the, induced, voltage, is, proportional, to, the, time, rate, of, change, of, the, current, the, constant, of, proportionality, is, termed, the, inductance, the, unit, of, inductance, is, the, henry, named, after, joseph, henry, a, contemporary, of, faraday, one, henry, is, the, inductance, that, will, induce, a, potential, difference, of, one, volt, if, the, current, through, it, changes, at, a, rate, of, one, ampere, per, second, the, inductor, s, behaviour, is, in, some, regards, converse, to, that, of, the, capacitor, it, will, freely, allow, an, unchanging, current, but, opposes, a, rapidly, changing, one, 226, 29, electric, power, is, the, rate, at, which, electric, energy, is, transferred, by, an, electric, circuit, the, si, unit, of, power, is, the, watt, one, joule, per, second, electric, power, like, mechanical, power, is, the, rate, of, doing, work, measured, in, watts, and, represented, by, the, letter, p, the, term, wattage, is, used, colloquially, to, mean, electric, power, in, watts, the, electric, power, in, watts, produced, by, an, electric, current, i, consisting, of, a, charge, of, q, coulombs, every, t, seconds, passing, through, an, electric, potential, voltage, difference, of, v, is, where, electric, power, is, generally, supplied, to, businesses, and, homes, by, the, electric, power, industry, electricity, is, usually, sold, by, the, kilowatt, hour, 3, 6, mj, which, is, the, product, of, power, in, kilowatts, multiplied, by, running, time, in, hours, electric, utilities, measure, power, using, electricity, meters, which, keep, a, running, total, of, the, electric, energy, delivered, to, a, customer, unlike, fossil, fuels, electricity, is, a, low, entropy, form, of, energy, and, can, be, converted, into, motion, or, many, other, forms, of, energy, with, high, efficiency, electronics, deals, with, electrical, circuits, that, involve, active, electrical, components, such, as, vacuum, tubes, transistors, diodes, sensors, and, integrated, circuits, and, associated, passive, interconnection, technologies, 1, 5, 71, the, nonlinear, behaviour, of, active, components, and, their, ability, to, control, electron, flows, makes, digital, switching, possible, 75, and, electronics, is, widely, used, in, information, processing, telecommunications, and, signal, processing, interconnection, technologies, such, as, circuit, boards, electronics, packaging, technology, and, other, varied, forms, of, communication, infrastructure, complete, circuit, functionality, and, transform, the, mixed, components, into, a, regular, working, system, today, most, electronic, devices, use, semiconductor, components, to, perform, electron, control, the, underlying, principles, that, explain, how, semiconductors, work, are, studied, in, solid, state, physics, whereas, the, design, and, construction, of, electronic, circuits, to, solve, practical, problems, are, part, of, electronics, engineering, faraday, s, and, amp, re, s, work, showed, that, a, time, varying, magnetic, field, created, an, electric, field, and, a, time, varying, electric, field, created, a, magnetic, field, thus, when, either, field, is, changing, in, time, a, field, of, the, other, is, always, induced, 696, 700, these, variations, are, an, electromagnetic, wave, electromagnetic, waves, were, analysed, theoretically, by, james, clerk, maxwell, in, 1864, maxwell, developed, a, set, of, equations, that, could, unambiguously, describe, the, interrelationship, between, electric, field, magnetic, field, electric, charge, and, electric, current, he, could, moreover, prove, that, in, a, vacuum, such, a, wave, would, travel, at, the, speed, of, light, and, thus, light, itself, was, a, form, of, electromagnetic, radiation, maxwell, s, equations, which, unify, light, fields, and, charge, are, one, of, the, great, milestones, of, theoretical, physics, 696, 700, the, work, of, many, researchers, enabled, the, use, of, electronics, to, convert, signals, into, high, frequency, oscillating, currents, and, via, suitably, shaped, conductors, electricity, permits, the, transmission, and, reception, of, these, signals, via, radio, waves, over, very, long, distances, in, the, 6th, century, bc, the, greek, philosopher, thales, of, miletus, experimented, with, amber, rods, these, were, the, first, studies, into, the, production, of, electricity, while, this, method, now, known, as, the, triboelectric, effect, can, lift, light, objects, and, generate, sparks, it, is, extremely, inefficient, it, was, not, until, the, invention, of, the, voltaic, pile, in, the, eighteenth, century, that, a, viable, source, of, electricity, became, available, the, voltaic, pile, and, its, modern, descendant, the, electrical, battery, store, energy, chemically, and, make, it, available, on, demand, in, the, form, of, electricity, electrical, power, is, usually, generated, by, electro, mechanical, generators, these, can, be, driven, by, steam, produced, from, fossil, fuel, combustion, or, the, heat, released, from, nuclear, reactions, but, also, more, directly, from, the, kinetic, energy, of, wind, or, flowing, water, the, steam, turbine, invented, by, sir, charles, parsons, in, 1884, is, still, used, to, convert, the, thermal, energy, of, steam, into, a, rotary, motion, that, can, be, used, by, electro, mechanical, generators, such, generators, bear, no, resemblance, to, faraday, s, homopolar, disc, generator, of, 1831, but, they, still, rely, on, his, electromagnetic, principle, that, a, conductor, linking, a, changing, magnetic, field, induces, a, potential, difference, across, its, ends, electricity, generated, by, solar, panels, rely, on, a, different, mechanism, solar, radiation, is, converted, directly, into, electricity, using, the, photovoltaic, effect, demand, for, electricity, grows, with, great, rapidity, as, a, nation, modernises, and, its, economy, develops, the, united, states, showed, a, 12, increase, in, demand, during, each, year, of, the, first, three, decades, of, the, twentieth, century, a, rate, of, growth, that, is, now, being, experienced, by, emerging, economies, such, as, those, of, india, or, china, environmental, concerns, with, electricity, generation, in, specific, the, contribution, of, fossil, fuel, burning, to, climate, change, have, led, to, an, increased, focus, on, generation, from, renewable, sources, in, the, power, sector, wind, and, solar, have, become, cost, effective, speeding, up, an, energy, transition, away, from, fossil, fuels, the, invention, in, the, late, nineteenth, century, of, the, transformer, meant, that, electrical, power, could, be, transmitted, more, efficiently, at, a, higher, voltage, but, lower, current, efficient, electrical, transmission, meant, in, turn, that, electricity, could, be, generated, at, centralised, power, stations, where, it, benefited, from, economies, of, scale, and, then, be, despatched, relatively, long, distances, to, where, it, was, needed, normally, demand, of, electricity, must, match, the, supply, as, storage, of, electricity, is, difficult, a, certain, amount, of, generation, must, always, be, held, in, reserve, to, cushion, an, electrical, grid, against, inevitable, disturbances, and, losses, with, increasing, levels, of, variable, renewable, energy, wind, and, solar, energy, in, the, grid, it, has, become, more, challenging, to, match, supply, and, demand, storage, plays, an, increasing, role, in, bridging, that, gap, there, are, four, types, of, energy, storage, technologies, each, in, varying, states, of, technology, readiness, batteries, electrochemical, storage, chemical, storage, such, as, hydrogen, thermal, or, mechanical, such, as, pumped, hydropower, electricity, is, a, very, convenient, way, to, transfer, energy, and, it, has, been, adapted, to, a, huge, and, growing, number, of, uses, the, invention, of, a, practical, incandescent, light, bulb, in, the, 1870s, led, to, lighting, becoming, one, of, the, first, publicly, available, applications, of, electrical, power, although, electrification, brought, with, it, its, own, dangers, replacing, the, naked, flames, of, gas, lighting, greatly, reduced, fire, hazards, within, homes, and, factories, public, utilities, were, set, up, in, many, cities, targeting, the, burgeoning, market, for, electrical, lighting, in, the, late, 20th, century, and, in, modern, times, the, trend, has, started, to, flow, in, the, direction, of, deregulation, in, the, electrical, power, sector, the, resistive, joule, heating, effect, employed, in, filament, light, bulbs, also, sees, more, direct, use, in, electric, heating, while, this, is, versatile, and, controllable, it, can, be, seen, as, wasteful, since, most, electrical, generation, has, already, required, the, production, of, heat, at, a, power, station, a, number, of, countries, such, as, denmark, have, issued, legislation, restricting, or, banning, the, use, of, resistive, electric, heating, in, new, buildings, electricity, is, however, still, a, highly, practical, energy, source, for, heating, and, refrigeration, with, air, conditioning, heat, pumps, representing, a, growing, sector, for, electricity, demand, for, heating, and, cooling, the, effects, of, which, electricity, utilities, are, increasingly, obliged, to, accommodate, electrification, is, expected, to, play, a, major, role, in, the, decarbonisation, of, sectors, that, rely, on, direct, fossil, fuel, burning, such, as, transport, using, electric, vehicles, and, heating, using, heat, pumps, the, effects, of, electromagnetism, are, most, visibly, employed, in, the, electric, motor, which, provides, a, clean, and, efficient, means, of, motive, power, a, stationary, motor, such, as, a, winch, is, easily, provided, with, a, supply, of, power, but, a, motor, that, moves, with, its, application, such, as, an, electric, vehicle, is, obliged, to, either, carry, along, a, power, source, such, as, a, battery, or, to, collect, current, from, a, sliding, contact, such, as, a, pantograph, electrically, powered, vehicles, are, used, in, public, transportation, such, as, electric, buses, and, trains, and, an, increasing, number, of, battery, powered, electric, cars, in, private, ownership, electricity, is, used, within, telecommunications, and, indeed, the, electrical, telegraph, demonstrated, commercially, in, 1837, by, cooke, and, wheatstone, was, one, of, its, earliest, applications, with, the, construction, of, first, transcontinental, and, then, transatlantic, telegraph, systems, in, the, 1860s, electricity, had, enabled, communications, in, minutes, across, the, globe, optical, fibre, and, satellite, communication, have, taken, a, share, of, the, market, for, communications, systems, but, electricity, can, be, expected, to, remain, an, essential, part, of, the, process, electronic, devices, make, use, of, the, transistor, perhaps, one, of, the, most, important, inventions, of, the, twentieth, century, and, a, fundamental, building, block, of, all, modern, circuitry, a, modern, integrated, circuit, may, contain, many, billions, of, miniaturised, transistors, in, a, region, only, a, few, centimetres, square, a, voltage, applied, to, a, human, body, causes, an, electric, current, through, the, tissues, and, although, the, relationship, is, non, linear, the, greater, the, voltage, the, greater, the, current, the, threshold, for, perception, varies, with, the, supply, frequency, and, with, the, path, of, the, current, but, is, about, 0, 1, ma, to, 1, ma, for, mains, frequency, electricity, though, a, current, as, low, as, a, microamp, can, be, detected, as, an, electrovibration, effect, under, certain, conditions, if, the, current, is, sufficiently, high, it, will, cause, muscle, contraction, fibrillation, of, the, heart, and, tissue, burns, the, lack, of, any, visible, sign, that, a, conductor, is, electrified, makes, electricity, a, particular, hazard, the, pain, caused, by, an, electric, shock, can, be, intense, leading, electricity, at, times, to, be, employed, as, a, method, of, torture, death, caused, by, an, electric, shock, electrocution, is, still, used, for, judicial, execution, in, some, us, states, though, its, use, had, become, very, rare, by, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, electricity, is, not, a, human, invention, and, may, be, observed, in, several, forms, in, nature, notably, lightning, many, interactions, familiar, at, the, macroscopic, level, such, as, touch, friction, or, chemical, bonding, are, due, to, interactions, between, electric, fields, on, the, atomic, scale, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, is, due, to, the, natural, dynamo, of, circulating, currents, in, the, planet, s, core, certain, crystals, such, as, quartz, or, even, sugar, generate, a, potential, difference, across, their, faces, when, pressed, this, phenomenon, is, known, as, piezoelectricity, from, the, greek, piezein, meaning, to, press, and, was, discovered, in, 1880, by, pierre, and, jacques, curie, the, effect, is, reciprocal, when, a, piezoelectric, material, is, subjected, to, an, electric, field, it, changes, size, slightly, some, organisms, such, as, sharks, are, able, to, detect, and, respond, to, changes, in, electric, fields, an, ability, known, as, electroreception, while, others, termed, electrogenic, are, able, to, generate, voltages, themselves, to, serve, as, a, predatory, or, defensive, weapon, these, are, electric, fish, in, different, orders, the, order, gymnotiformes, of, which, the, best, known, example, is, the, electric, eel, detect, or, stun, their, prey, via, high, voltages, generated, from, modified, muscle, cells, called, electrocytes, all, animals, transmit, information, along, their, cell, membranes, with, voltage, pulses, called, action, potentials, whose, functions, include, communication, by, the, nervous, system, between, neurons, and, muscles, an, electric, shock, stimulates, this, system, and, causes, muscles, to, contract, action, potentials, are, also, responsible, for, coordinating, activities, in, certain, plants, it, is, said, that, in, the, 1850s, british, politician, william, ewart, gladstone, asked, the, scientist, michael, faraday, why, electricity, was, valuable, faraday, answered, one, day, sir, you, may, tax, it, however, according, to, snopes, com, the, anecdote, should, be, considered, apocryphal, because, it, isn, t, mentioned, in, any, accounts, by, faraday, or, his, contemporaries, letters, newspapers, or, biographies, and, only, popped, up, well, after, faraday, s, death, in, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, electricity, was, not, part, of, the, everyday, life, of, many, people, even, in, the, industrialised, western, world, the, popular, culture, of, the, time, accordingly, often, depicted, it, as, a, mysterious, quasi, magical, force, that, can, slay, the, living, revive, the, dead, or, otherwise, bend, the, laws, of, nature, 69, this, attitude, began, with, the, 1771, experiments, of, luigi, galvani, in, which, the, legs, of, dead, frogs, were, shown, to, twitch, on, application, of, animal, electricity, revitalization, or, resuscitation, of, apparently, dead, or, drowned, persons, was, reported, in, the, medical, literature, shortly, after, galvani, s, work, these, results, were, known, to, mary, shelley, when, she, authored, frankenstein, 1819, although, she, does, not, name, the, method, of, revitalization, of, the, monster, the, revitalization, of, monsters, with, electricity, later, became, a, stock, theme, in, horror, films, as, the, public, familiarity, with, electricity, as, the, lifeblood, of, the, second, industrial, revolution, grew, its, wielders, were, more, often, cast, in, a, positive, light, 71, such, as, the, workers, who, finger, death, at, their, gloves, end, as, they, piece, and, repiece, the, living, wires, in, rudyard, kipling, s, 1907, poem, sons, of, martha, 71, electrically, powered, vehicles, of, every, sort, featured, large, in, adventure, stories, such, as, those, of, jules, verne, and, the, tom, swift, books, 71, the, masters, of, electricity, whether, fictional, or, real, including, scientists, such, as, thomas, edison, charles, steinmetz, or, nikola, tesla, were, popularly, conceived, of, as, having, wizard, like, powers, 71, with, electricity, ceasing, to, be, a, novelty, and, becoming, a, necessity, of, everyday, life, in, the, later, half, of, the, 20th, century, it, required, particular, attention, by, popular, culture, only, when, it, stops, flowing, 71, an, event, that, usually, signals, disaster, 71, the, people, who, keep, it, flowing, such, as, the, nameless, hero, of, jimmy, webb, s, song, wichita, lineman, 1968, 71, are, still, often, cast, as, heroic, wizard, like, figures, 71
