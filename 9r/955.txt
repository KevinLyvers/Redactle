in, particle, physics, quantum, electrodynamics, qed, is, the, relativistic, quantum, field, theory, of, electrodynamics, in, essence, it, describes, how, light, and, matter, interact, and, is, the, first, theory, where, full, agreement, between, quantum, mechanics, and, special, relativity, is, achieved, qed, mathematically, describes, all, phenomena, involving, electrically, charged, particles, interacting, by, means, of, exchange, of, photons, and, represents, the, quantum, counterpart, of, classical, electromagnetism, giving, a, complete, account, of, matter, and, light, interaction, in, technical, terms, qed, can, be, described, as, a, very, accurate, way, to, calculate, the, probability, of, the, position, and, movement, of, particles, even, those, massless, such, as, photons, and, the, quantity, depending, on, position, field, of, those, particles, and, described, light, and, matter, beyond, the, wave, particle, duality, proposed, by, albert, einstein, in, 1905, richard, feynman, called, it, the, jewel, of, physics, for, its, extremely, accurate, predictions, of, quantities, like, the, anomalous, magnetic, moment, of, the, electron, and, the, lamb, shift, of, the, energy, levels, of, hydrogen, ch1, it, is, the, most, precise, and, stringently, tested, theory, in, physics, the, first, formulation, of, a, quantum, theory, describing, radiation, and, matter, interaction, is, attributed, to, british, scientist, paul, dirac, who, during, the, 1920s, was, able, to, compute, the, coefficient, of, spontaneous, emission, of, an, atom, he, is, also, credited, with, coining, the, term, quantum, electrodynamics, dirac, described, the, quantization, of, the, electromagnetic, field, as, an, ensemble, of, harmonic, oscillators, with, the, introduction, of, the, concept, of, creation, and, annihilation, operators, of, particles, in, the, following, years, with, contributions, from, wolfgang, pauli, eugene, wigner, pascual, jordan, werner, heisenberg, and, an, elegant, formulation, of, quantum, electrodynamics, by, enrico, fermi, physicists, came, to, believe, that, in, principle, it, would, be, possible, to, perform, any, computation, for, any, physical, process, involving, photons, and, charged, particles, however, further, studies, by, felix, bloch, with, arnold, nordsieck, and, victor, weisskopf, in, 1937, and, 1939, revealed, that, such, computations, were, reliable, only, at, a, first, order, of, perturbation, theory, a, problem, already, pointed, out, by, robert, oppenheimer, at, higher, orders, in, the, series, infinities, emerged, making, such, computations, meaningless, and, casting, serious, doubts, on, the, internal, consistency, of, the, theory, itself, with, no, solution, for, this, problem, known, at, the, time, it, appeared, that, a, fundamental, incompatibility, existed, between, special, relativity, and, quantum, mechanics, difficulties, with, the, theory, increased, through, the, end, of, the, 1940s, improvements, in, microwave, technology, made, it, possible, to, take, more, precise, measurements, of, the, shift, of, the, levels, of, a, hydrogen, atom, now, known, as, the, lamb, shift, and, magnetic, moment, of, the, electron, these, experiments, exposed, discrepancies, which, the, theory, was, unable, to, explain, a, first, indication, of, a, possible, way, out, was, given, by, hans, bethe, in, 1947, after, attending, the, shelter, island, conference, while, he, was, traveling, by, train, from, the, conference, to, schenectady, he, made, the, first, non, relativistic, computation, of, the, shift, of, the, lines, of, the, hydrogen, atom, as, measured, by, lamb, and, retherford, despite, the, limitations, of, the, computation, agreement, was, excellent, the, idea, was, simply, to, attach, infinities, to, corrections, of, mass, and, charge, that, were, actually, fixed, to, a, finite, value, by, experiments, in, this, way, the, infinities, get, absorbed, in, those, constants, and, yield, a, finite, result, in, good, agreement, with, experiments, this, procedure, was, named, renormalization, based, on, bethe, s, intuition, and, fundamental, papers, on, the, subject, by, shin, ichir, tomonaga, julian, schwinger, richard, feynman, and, freeman, dyson, it, was, finally, possible, to, get, fully, covariant, formulations, that, were, finite, at, any, order, in, a, perturbation, series, of, quantum, electrodynamics, shin, ichir, tomonaga, julian, schwinger, and, richard, feynman, were, jointly, awarded, with, the, 1965, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, their, work, in, this, area, their, contributions, and, those, of, freeman, dyson, were, about, covariant, and, gauge, invariant, formulations, of, quantum, electrodynamics, that, allow, computations, of, observables, at, any, order, of, perturbation, theory, feynman, s, mathematical, technique, based, on, his, diagrams, initially, seemed, very, different, from, the, field, theoretic, operator, based, approach, of, schwinger, and, tomonaga, but, freeman, dyson, later, showed, that, the, two, approaches, were, equivalent, renormalization, the, need, to, attach, a, physical, meaning, at, certain, divergences, appearing, in, the, theory, through, integrals, has, subsequently, become, one, of, the, fundamental, aspects, of, quantum, field, theory, and, has, come, to, be, seen, as, a, criterion, for, a, theory, s, general, acceptability, even, though, renormalization, works, very, well, in, practice, feynman, was, never, entirely, comfortable, with, its, mathematical, validity, even, referring, to, renormalization, as, a, shell, game, and, hocus, pocus, 128, thence, neither, feynman, nor, dirac, were, happy, with, that, way, to, approach, the, observations, made, in, theoretical, physics, above, all, in, quantum, mechanics, qed, has, served, as, the, model, and, template, for, all, subsequent, quantum, field, theories, one, such, subsequent, theory, is, quantum, chromodynamics, which, began, in, the, early, 1960s, and, attained, its, present, form, in, the, 1970s, work, by, h, david, politzer, sidney, coleman, david, gross, and, frank, wilczek, building, on, the, pioneering, work, of, schwinger, gerald, guralnik, dick, hagen, and, tom, kibble, peter, higgs, jeffrey, goldstone, and, others, sheldon, glashow, steven, weinberg, and, abdus, salam, independently, showed, how, the, weak, nuclear, force, and, quantum, electrodynamics, could, be, merged, into, a, single, electroweak, force, near, the, end, of, his, life, richard, feynman, gave, a, series, of, lectures, on, qed, intended, for, the, lay, public, these, lectures, were, transcribed, and, published, as, feynman, 1985, qed, the, strange, theory, of, light, and, matter, a, classic, non, mathematical, exposition, of, qed, from, the, point, of, view, articulated, below, the, key, components, of, feynman, s, presentation, of, qed, are, three, basic, actions, 85, these, actions, are, represented, in, the, form, of, visual, shorthand, by, the, three, basic, elements, of, diagrams, a, wavy, line, for, the, photon, a, straight, line, for, the, electron, and, a, junction, of, two, straight, lines, and, a, wavy, one, for, a, vertex, representing, emission, or, absorption, of, a, photon, by, an, electron, these, can, all, be, seen, in, the, adjacent, diagram, as, well, as, the, visual, shorthand, for, the, actions, feynman, introduces, another, kind, of, shorthand, for, the, numerical, quantities, called, probability, amplitudes, the, probability, is, the, square, of, the, absolute, value, of, total, probability, amplitude, probability, f, amplitude, 2, displaystyle, text, probability, f, text, amplitude, 2, if, a, photon, moves, from, one, place, and, time, a, displaystyle, a, to, another, place, and, time, b, displaystyle, b, the, associated, quantity, is, written, in, feynman, s, shorthand, as, p, a, to, b, displaystyle, p, a, text, to, b, and, it, depends, on, only, the, momentum, and, polarization, of, the, photon, the, similar, quantity, for, an, electron, moving, from, c, displaystyle, c, to, d, displaystyle, d, is, written, e, c, to, d, displaystyle, e, c, text, to, d, it, depends, on, the, momentum, and, polarization, of, the, electron, in, addition, to, a, constant, feynman, calls, n, sometimes, called, the, bare, mass, of, the, electron, it, is, related, to, but, not, the, same, as, the, measured, electron, mass, finally, the, quantity, that, tells, us, about, the, probability, amplitude, for, an, electron, to, emit, or, absorb, a, photon, feynman, calls, j, and, is, sometimes, called, the, bare, charge, of, the, electron, it, is, a, constant, and, is, related, to, but, not, the, same, as, the, measured, electron, charge, e, 91, qed, is, based, on, the, assumption, that, complex, interactions, of, many, electrons, and, photons, can, be, represented, by, fitting, together, a, suitable, collection, of, the, above, three, building, blocks, and, then, using, the, probability, amplitudes, to, calculate, the, probability, of, any, such, complex, interaction, it, turns, out, that, the, basic, idea, of, qed, can, be, communicated, while, assuming, that, the, square, of, the, total, of, the, probability, amplitudes, mentioned, above, p, a, to, b, e, c, to, d, and, j, acts, just, like, our, everyday, probability, a, simplification, made, in, feynman, s, book, later, on, this, will, be, corrected, to, include, specifically, quantum, style, mathematics, following, feynman, the, basic, rules, of, probability, amplitudes, that, will, be, used, are, 93, the, indistinguishability, criterion, in, a, is, very, important, it, means, that, there, is, no, observable, feature, present, in, the, given, system, that, in, any, way, reveals, which, alternative, is, taken, in, such, a, case, one, cannot, observe, which, alternative, actually, takes, place, without, changing, the, experimental, setup, in, some, way, e, g, by, introducing, a, new, apparatus, into, the, system, whenever, one, is, able, to, observe, which, alternative, takes, place, one, always, finds, that, the, probability, of, the, event, is, the, sum, of, the, probabilities, of, the, alternatives, indeed, if, this, were, not, the, case, the, very, term, alternatives, to, describe, these, processes, would, be, inappropriate, what, a, says, is, that, once, the, physical, means, for, observing, which, alternative, occurred, is, removed, one, cannot, still, say, that, the, event, is, occurring, through, exactly, one, of, the, alternatives, in, the, sense, of, adding, probabilities, one, must, add, the, amplitudes, instead, 82, similarly, the, independence, criterion, in, b, is, very, important, it, only, applies, to, processes, which, are, not, entangled, suppose, we, start, with, one, electron, at, a, certain, place, and, time, this, place, and, time, being, given, the, arbitrary, label, a, and, a, photon, at, another, place, and, time, given, the, label, b, a, typical, question, from, a, physical, standpoint, is, what, is, the, probability, of, finding, an, electron, at, c, another, place, and, a, later, time, and, a, photon, at, d, yet, another, place, and, time, the, simplest, process, to, achieve, this, end, is, for, the, electron, to, move, from, a, to, c, an, elementary, action, and, for, the, photon, to, move, from, b, to, d, another, elementary, action, from, a, knowledge, of, the, probability, amplitudes, of, each, of, these, sub, processes, e, a, to, c, and, p, b, to, d, we, would, expect, to, calculate, the, probability, amplitude, of, both, happening, together, by, multiplying, them, using, rule, b, above, this, gives, a, simple, estimated, overall, probability, amplitude, which, is, squared, to, give, an, estimated, probability, but, there, are, other, ways, in, which, the, result, could, come, about, the, electron, might, move, to, a, place, and, time, e, where, it, absorbs, the, photon, then, move, on, before, emitting, another, photon, at, f, then, move, on, to, c, where, it, is, detected, while, the, new, photon, moves, on, to, d, the, probability, of, this, complex, process, can, again, be, calculated, by, knowing, the, probability, amplitudes, of, each, of, the, individual, actions, three, electron, actions, two, photon, actions, and, two, vertexes, one, emission, and, one, absorption, we, would, expect, to, find, the, total, probability, amplitude, by, multiplying, the, probability, amplitudes, of, each, of, the, actions, for, any, chosen, positions, of, e, and, f, we, then, using, rule, a, above, have, to, add, up, all, these, probability, amplitudes, for, all, the, alternatives, for, e, and, f, this, is, not, elementary, in, practice, and, involves, integration, but, there, is, another, possibility, which, is, that, the, electron, first, moves, to, g, where, it, emits, a, photon, which, goes, on, to, d, while, the, electron, moves, on, to, h, where, it, absorbs, the, first, photon, before, moving, on, to, c, again, we, can, calculate, the, probability, amplitude, of, these, possibilities, for, all, points, g, and, h, we, then, have, a, better, estimation, for, the, total, probability, amplitude, by, adding, the, probability, amplitudes, of, these, two, possibilities, to, our, original, simple, estimate, incidentally, the, name, given, to, this, process, of, a, photon, interacting, with, an, electron, in, this, way, is, compton, scattering, there, is, an, infinite, number, of, other, intermediate, virtual, processes, in, which, more, and, more, photons, are, absorbed, and, or, emitted, for, each, of, these, processes, a, feynman, diagram, could, be, drawn, describing, it, this, implies, a, complex, computation, for, the, resulting, probability, amplitudes, but, provided, it, is, the, case, that, the, more, complicated, the, diagram, the, less, it, contributes, to, the, result, it, is, only, a, matter, of, time, and, effort, to, find, as, accurate, an, answer, as, one, wants, to, the, original, question, this, is, the, basic, approach, of, qed, to, calculate, the, probability, of, any, interactive, process, between, electrons, and, photons, it, is, a, matter, of, first, noting, with, feynman, diagrams, all, the, possible, ways, in, which, the, process, can, be, constructed, from, the, three, basic, elements, each, diagram, involves, some, calculation, involving, definite, rules, to, find, the, associated, probability, amplitude, that, basic, scaffolding, remains, when, one, moves, to, a, quantum, description, but, some, conceptual, changes, are, needed, one, is, that, whereas, we, might, expect, in, our, everyday, life, that, there, would, be, some, constraints, on, the, points, to, which, a, particle, can, move, that, is, not, true, in, full, quantum, electrodynamics, there, is, a, nonzero, probability, amplitude, of, an, electron, at, a, or, a, photon, at, b, moving, as, a, basic, action, to, any, other, place, and, time, in, the, universe, that, includes, places, that, could, only, be, reached, at, speeds, greater, than, that, of, light, and, also, earlier, times, an, electron, moving, backwards, in, time, can, be, viewed, as, a, positron, moving, forward, in, time, 89, 98, 99, quantum, mechanics, introduces, an, important, change, in, the, way, probabilities, are, computed, probabilities, are, still, represented, by, the, usual, real, numbers, we, use, for, probabilities, in, our, everyday, world, but, probabilities, are, computed, as, the, square, modulus, of, probability, amplitudes, which, are, complex, numbers, feynman, avoids, exposing, the, reader, to, the, mathematics, of, complex, numbers, by, using, a, simple, but, accurate, representation, of, them, as, arrows, on, a, piece, of, paper, or, screen, these, must, not, be, confused, with, the, arrows, of, feynman, diagrams, which, are, simplified, representations, in, two, dimensions, of, a, relationship, between, points, in, three, dimensions, of, space, and, one, of, time, the, amplitude, arrows, are, fundamental, to, the, description, of, the, world, given, by, quantum, theory, they, are, related, to, our, everyday, ideas, of, probability, by, the, simple, rule, that, the, probability, of, an, event, is, the, square, of, the, length, of, the, corresponding, amplitude, arrow, so, for, a, given, process, if, two, probability, amplitudes, v, and, w, are, involved, the, probability, of, the, process, will, be, given, either, by, or, the, rules, as, regards, adding, or, multiplying, however, are, the, same, as, above, but, where, you, would, expect, to, add, or, multiply, probabilities, instead, you, add, or, multiply, probability, amplitudes, that, now, are, complex, numbers, addition, and, multiplication, are, common, operations, in, the, theory, of, complex, numbers, and, are, given, in, the, figures, the, sum, is, found, as, follows, let, the, start, of, the, second, arrow, be, at, the, end, of, the, first, the, sum, is, then, a, third, arrow, that, goes, directly, from, the, beginning, of, the, first, to, the, end, of, the, second, the, product, of, two, arrows, is, an, arrow, whose, length, is, the, product, of, the, two, lengths, the, direction, of, the, product, is, found, by, adding, the, angles, that, each, of, the, two, have, been, turned, through, relative, to, a, reference, direction, that, gives, the, angle, that, the, product, is, turned, relative, to, the, reference, direction, that, change, from, probabilities, to, probability, amplitudes, complicates, the, mathematics, without, changing, the, basic, approach, but, that, change, is, still, not, quite, enough, because, it, fails, to, take, into, account, the, fact, that, both, photons, and, electrons, can, be, polarized, which, is, to, say, that, their, orientations, in, space, and, time, have, to, be, taken, into, account, therefore, p, a, to, b, consists, of, 16, complex, numbers, or, probability, amplitude, arrows, 120, 121, there, are, also, some, minor, changes, to, do, with, the, quantity, j, which, may, have, to, be, rotated, by, a, multiple, of, 90, for, some, polarizations, which, is, only, of, interest, for, the, detailed, bookkeeping, associated, with, the, fact, that, the, electron, can, be, polarized, is, another, small, necessary, detail, which, is, connected, with, the, fact, that, an, electron, is, a, fermion, and, obeys, fermi, dirac, statistics, the, basic, rule, is, that, if, we, have, the, probability, amplitude, for, a, given, complex, process, involving, more, than, one, electron, then, when, we, include, as, we, always, must, the, complementary, feynman, diagram, in, which, we, exchange, two, electron, events, the, resulting, amplitude, is, the, reverse, the, negative, of, the, first, the, simplest, case, would, be, two, electrons, starting, at, a, and, b, ending, at, c, and, d, the, amplitude, would, be, calculated, as, the, difference, e, a, to, d, e, b, to, c, e, a, to, c, e, b, to, d, where, we, would, expect, from, our, everyday, idea, of, probabilities, that, it, would, be, a, sum, 112, 113, finally, one, has, to, compute, p, a, to, b, and, e, c, to, d, corresponding, to, the, probability, amplitudes, for, the, photon, and, the, electron, respectively, these, are, essentially, the, solutions, of, the, dirac, equation, which, describe, the, behavior, of, the, electron, s, probability, amplitude, and, the, maxwell, s, equations, which, describes, the, behavior, of, the, photon, s, probability, amplitude, these, are, called, feynman, propagators, the, translation, to, a, notation, commonly, used, in, the, standard, literature, is, as, follows, where, a, shorthand, symbol, such, as, x, a, displaystyle, x, a, stands, for, the, four, real, numbers, that, give, the, time, and, position, in, three, dimensions, of, the, point, labeled, a, a, problem, arose, historically, which, held, up, progress, for, twenty, years, although, we, start, with, the, assumption, of, three, basic, simple, actions, the, rules, of, the, game, say, that, if, we, want, to, calculate, the, probability, amplitude, for, an, electron, to, get, from, a, to, b, we, must, take, into, account, all, the, possible, ways, all, possible, feynman, diagrams, with, those, endpoints, thus, there, will, be, a, way, in, which, the, electron, travels, to, c, emits, a, photon, there, and, then, absorbs, it, again, at, d, before, moving, on, to, b, or, it, could, do, this, kind, of, thing, twice, or, more, in, short, we, have, a, fractal, like, situation, in, which, if, we, look, closely, at, a, line, it, breaks, up, into, a, collection, of, simple, lines, each, of, which, if, looked, at, closely, are, in, turn, composed, of, simple, lines, and, so, on, ad, infinitum, this, is, a, challenging, situation, to, handle, if, adding, that, detail, only, altered, things, slightly, then, it, would, not, have, been, too, bad, but, disaster, struck, when, it, was, found, that, the, simple, correction, mentioned, above, led, to, infinite, probability, amplitudes, in, time, this, problem, was, fixed, by, the, technique, of, renormalization, however, feynman, himself, remained, unhappy, about, it, calling, it, a, dippy, process, 128, and, dirac, also, criticized, this, procedure, as, in, mathematics, one, does, not, get, rid, of, infinities, when, it, does, not, please, you, within, the, above, framework, physicists, were, then, able, to, calculate, to, a, high, degree, of, accuracy, some, of, the, properties, of, electrons, such, as, the, anomalous, magnetic, dipole, moment, however, as, feynman, points, out, it, fails, to, explain, why, particles, such, as, the, electron, have, the, masses, they, do, there, is, no, theory, that, adequately, explains, these, numbers, we, use, the, numbers, in, all, our, theories, but, we, don, t, understand, them, what, they, are, or, where, they, come, from, i, believe, that, from, a, fundamental, point, of, view, this, is, a, very, interesting, and, serious, problem, 152, mathematically, qed, is, an, abelian, gauge, theory, with, the, symmetry, group, u, 1, defined, on, minkowski, space, flat, spacetime, the, gauge, field, which, mediates, the, interaction, between, the, charged, spin, 1, 2, fields, is, the, electromagnetic, field, the, qed, lagrangian, for, a, spin, 1, 2, field, interacting, with, the, electromagnetic, field, in, natural, units, gives, rise, to, the, action,

into, a, new, gauge, field, a, a, b, displaystyle, a, mu, a, mu, b, mu, and, relabel, the, new, field, as, a, displaystyle, a, mu, from, this, lagrangian, the, equations, of, motion, for, the, displaystyle, psi, and, a, displaystyle, a, mu, fields, can, be, obtained, these, arise, most, straightforwardly, by, considering, the, euler, lagrange, equation, for, displaystyle, bar, psi, since, the, lagrangian, contains, no, displaystyle, partial, mu, bar, psi, terms, we, immediately, get, so, the, equation, of, motion, can, be, written, i, m, e, a, displaystyle, i, gamma, mu, partial, mu,

written, in, terms, of, the, u, 1, displaystyle, text, u, 1, current, j, displaystyle, j, mu, as, f, e, j, displaystyle, partial, mu, f, mu, nu, ej, nu, now, if, we, impose, the, lorenz, gauge, condition, a, 0, displaystyle, partial, mu, a, mu, 0, the, equations, reduce, to, a, e, j, displaystyle, box, a, mu, ej, mu, which, is, a, wave, equation, for, the, four, potential, the, qed, version, of, the, classical, maxwell, equations, in, the, lorenz, gauge, the, square, represents, the, wave, operator, displaystyle, box, partial, mu, partial, mu, this, theory, can, be, straightforwardly, quantized, by, treating, bosonic, and, fermionic, sectors, as, free, this, permits, us, to, build, a, set, of, asymptotic, states, that, can, be, used, to, start, computation, of, the, probability, amplitudes, for, different, processes, in, order, to, do, so, we, have, to, compute, an, evolution, operator, which, for, a, given, initial, state, i, displaystyle, i, rangle, will, give, a, final,

structure, constant, as, the, development, parameter, this, series, is, called, the, dyson, series, despite, the, conceptual, clarity, of, this, feynman, approach, to, qed, almost, no, early, textbooks, follow, him, in, their, presentation, when, performing, calculations, it, is, much, easier, to, work, with, the, fourier, transforms, of, the, propagators, experimental, tests, of, quantum, electrodynamics, are, typically, scattering, experiments, in, scattering, theory, particles, momenta, rather, than, their, positions, are, considered, and, it, is, convenient, to, think, of, particles, as, being, created, or, annihilated, when, they, interact, feynman, diagrams, then, look, the, same, but, the, lines, have, different, interpretations, the, electron, line, represents, an, electron, with, a, given, energy, and, momentum, with, a, similar, interpretation, of, the, photon, line, a, vertex, diagram, represents, the, annihilation, of, one, electron, and, the, creation, of, another, together, with, the, absorption, or, creation, of, a, photon, each, having, specified, energies, and, momenta, using, wick, s, theorem, on, the, terms, of, the, dyson, series, all, the, terms, of, the, s, matrix, for, quantum, electrodynamics, can, be, computed, through, the, technique, of, feynman, diagrams, in, this, case, rules, for, drawing, are, the, following, 801, 802, to, these, rules, we, must, add, a, further, one, for, closed, loops, that, implies, an, integration, on, momenta, d, 4, p, 2, 4, textstyle, int, d, 4, p, 2, pi, 4, since, these, internal, virtual, particles, are, not, constrained, to, any, specific, energy, momentum, even, that, usually, required, by, special, relativity, see, propagator, for, details, the, signature, of, the, metric, displaystyle, eta, mu, nu, is, d, i, a, g, displaystyle, rm, diag, from, them, computations, of, probability, amplitudes, are, straightforwardly, given, an, example, is, compton, scattering, with, an, electron, and, a, photon, undergoing, elastic, scattering, feynman, diagrams, are, in, this, case, 158, 159, and, so, we, are, able, to, get, the, corresponding, amplitude, at, the, first, order, of, a, perturbation, series, for, the, s, matrix, m, f, i, i, e, 2, u, p, s, k, p, k, m, e, p, k, 2, m, e, 2, k, u, p, s, i, e, 2, u, p, s, k, p, k, m, e, p, k, 2, m, e, 2, k, u, p, s, displaystyle, m,

largely, rests, on, the, use, of, perturbation, theory, expressed, in, feynman, diagrams, however, quantum, electrodynamics, also, leads, to, predictions, beyond, perturbation, theory, in, the, presence, of, very, strong, electric, fields, it, predicts, that, electrons, and, positrons, will, be, spontaneously, produced, so, causing, the, decay, of, the, field, this, process, called, the, schwinger, effect, cannot, be, understood, in, terms, of, any, finite, number, of, feynman, diagrams, and, hence, is, described, as, nonperturbative, mathematically, it, can, be, derived, by, a, semiclassical, approximation, to, the, path, integral, of, quantum, electrodynamics, higher, order, terms, can, be, straightforwardly, computed, for, the, evolution, operator, but, these, terms, display, diagrams, containing, the, following, simpler, ones, ch, 10, that, being, closed, loops, imply, the, presence, of, diverging, integrals, having, no, mathematical, meaning, to, overcome, this, difficulty, a, technique, called, renormalization, has, been, devised, producing, finite, results, in, very, close, agreement, with, experiments, a, criterion, for, the, theory, being, meaningful, after, renormalization, is, that, the, number, of, diverging, diagrams, is, finite, in, this, case, the, theory, is, said, to, be, renormalizable, the, reason, for, this, is, that, to, get, observables, renormalized, one, needs, a, finite, number, of, constants, to, maintain, the, predictive, value, of, the, theory, untouched, this, is, exactly, the, case, of, quantum, electrodynamics, displaying, just, three, diverging, diagrams, this, procedure, gives, observables, in, very, close, agreement, with, experiment, as, seen, e, g, for, electron, gyromagnetic, ratio, renormalizability, has, become, an, essential, criterion, for, a, quantum, field, theory, to, be, considered, as, a, viable, one, all, the, theories, describing, fundamental, interactions, except, gravitation, whose, quantum, counterpart, is, only, conjectural, and, presently, under, very, active, research, are, renormalizable, theories, an, argument, by, freeman, dyson, shows, that, the, radius, of, convergence, of, the, perturbation, series, in, qed, is, zero, the, basic, argument, goes, as, follows, if, the, coupling, constant, were, negative, this, would, be, equivalent, to, the, coulomb, force, constant, being, negative, this, would, reverse, the, electromagnetic, interaction, so, that, like, charges, would, attract, and, unlike, charges, would, repel, this, would, render, the, vacuum, unstable, against, decay, into, a, cluster, of, electrons, on, one, side, of, the, universe, and, a, cluster, of, positrons, on, the, other, side, of, the, universe, because, the, theory, is, sick, for, any, negative, value, of, the, coupling, constant, the, series, does, not, converge, but, is, at, best, an, asymptotic, series, from, a, modern, perspective, we, say, that, qed, is, not, well, defined, as, a, quantum, field, theory, to, arbitrarily, high, energy, the, coupling, constant, runs, to, infinity, at, finite, energy, signalling, a, landau, pole, the, problem, is, essentially, that, qed, appears, to, suffer, from, quantum, triviality, issues, this, is, one, of, the, motivations, for, embedding, qed, within, a, grand, unified, theory, this, theory, can, be, extended, at, least, as, a, classical, field, theory, to, curved, spacetime, this, arises, similarly, to, the, flat, spacetime, case, from, coupling, a, free, electromagnetic, theory, to, a, free, fermion, theory, and, including, an, interaction, which, promotes, the, partial, derivative, in, the, fermion, theory, to, a, gauge, covariant, derivative
