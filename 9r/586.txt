a, pearl, is, a, hard, glistening, object, produced, within, the, soft, tissue, specifically, the, mantle, of, a, living, shelled, mollusk, or, another, animal, such, as, fossil, conulariids, just, like, the, shell, of, a, mollusk, a, pearl, is, composed, of, calcium, carbonate, mainly, aragonite, or, a, mixture, of, aragonite, and, calcite, in, minute, crystalline, form, which, has, deposited, in, concentric, layers, the, ideal, pearl, is, perfectly, round, and, smooth, but, many, other, shapes, known, as, baroque, pearls, can, occur, the, finest, quality, of, natural, pearls, have, been, highly, valued, as, gemstones, and, objects, of, beauty, for, many, centuries, because, of, this, pearl, has, become, a, metaphor, for, something, rare, fine, admirable, and, valuable, the, most, valuable, pearls, occur, spontaneously, in, the, wild, but, are, extremely, rare, these, wild, pearls, are, referred, to, as, natural, pearls, cultured, or, farmed, pearls, from, pearl, oysters, and, freshwater, mussels, make, up, the, majority, of, those, currently, sold, imitation, pearls, are, also, widely, sold, in, inexpensive, jewelry, pearls, have, been, harvested, and, cultivated, primarily, for, use, in, jewelry, but, in, the, past, were, also, used, to, adorn, clothing, they, have, also, been, crushed, and, used, in, cosmetics, medicines, and, paint, formulations, whether, wild, or, cultured, gem, quality, pearls, are, almost, always, nacreous, and, iridescent, like, the, interior, of, the, shell, that, produces, them, however, almost, all, species, of, shelled, mollusks, are, capable, of, producing, pearls, technically, calcareous, concretions, of, lesser, shine, or, less, spherical, shape, although, these, may, also, be, legitimately, referred, to, as, pearls, by, gemological, labs, and, also, under, u, s, federal, trade, commission, rules, and, are, formed, in, the, same, way, most, of, them, have, no, value, except, as, curiosities, the, english, word, pearl, comes, from, the, french, perle, originally, from, the, latin, perna, leg, after, the, ham, or, mutton, leg, shaped, bivalve, the, scientific, name, for, the, family, of, pearl, bearing, oysters, margaritiferidae, comes, from, the, old, persian, word, for, pearl, marg, r, ta, which, is, the, source, of, the, english, name, margaret, all, shelled, mollusks, can, by, natural, processes, produce, some, kind, of, pearl, when, an, irritating, microscopic, object, becomes, trapped, within, its, mantle, folds, but, the, great, majority, of, these, pearls, are, not, valued, as, gemstones, nacreous, pearls, the, best, known, and, most, commercially, significant, are, primarily, produced, by, two, groups, of, molluskan, bivalves, or, clams, a, nacreous, pearl, is, made, from, layers, of, nacre, by, the, same, living, process, as, is, used, in, the, secretion, of, the, mother, of, pearl, which, lines, the, shell, natural, or, wild, pearls, formed, without, human, intervention, are, very, rare, many, hundreds, of, pearl, oysters, or, mussels, must, be, gathered, and, opened, and, thus, killed, to, find, even, one, wild, pearl, for, many, centuries, this, was, the, only, way, pearls, were, obtained, and, why, pearls, fetched, such, extraordinary, prices, in, the, past, cultured, pearls, are, formed, in, pearl, farms, using, human, intervention, as, well, as, natural, processes, one, family, of, nacreous, pearl, bivalves, the, pearl, oyster, lives, in, the, sea, while, the, other, a, very, different, group, of, bivalves, lives, in, freshwater, these, are, the, river, mussels, such, as, the, freshwater, pearl, mussel, saltwater, pearls, can, grow, in, several, species, of, marine, pearl, oysters, in, the, family, pteriidae, freshwater, pearls, grow, within, certain, but, by, no, means, all, species, of, freshwater, mussels, in, the, order, unionida, the, families, unionidae, and, margaritiferidae, the, unique, luster, of, pearls, depends, upon, the, reflection, refraction, and, diffraction, of, light, from, the, translucent, layers, the, thinner, and, more, numerous, the, layers, in, the, pearl, the, finer, the, luster, the, iridescence, that, pearls, display, is, caused, by, the, overlapping, of, successive, layers, which, breaks, up, light, falling, on, the, surface, in, addition, pearls, especially, cultured, freshwater, pearls, can, be, dyed, yellow, green, blue, brown, pink, purple, or, black, the, most, valuable, pearls, have, a, metallic, highly, reflective, luster, because, pearls, are, made, primarily, of, calcium, carbonate, they, can, be, dissolved, in, vinegar, calcium, carbonate, is, susceptible, to, even, a, weak, acid, solution, because, the, crystals, react, with, the, acetic, acid, in, the, vinegar, to, form, calcium, acetate, and, carbon, dioxide, freshwater, and, saltwater, pearls, may, sometimes, look, quite, similar, but, they, come, from, different, sources, freshwater, pearls, form, in, various, species, of, freshwater, mussels, family, unionidae, which, live, in, lakes, rivers, ponds, and, other, bodies, of, fresh, water, these, freshwater, pearl, mussels, occur, not, only, in, hotter, climates, but, also, in, colder, more, temperate, areas, such, as, scotland, where, they, are, protected, under, law, most, freshwater, cultured, pearls, sold, today, come, from, china, saltwater, pearls, grow, within, pearl, oysters, family, pteriidae, which, live, in, oceans, saltwater, pearl, oysters, are, usually, cultivated, in, protected, lagoons, or, volcanic, atolls, the, mollusk, s, mantle, protective, membrane, deposits, layers, of, calcium, carbonate, caco, 3, in, the, form, of, the, mineral, aragonite, or, a, mixture, of, aragonite, and, calcite, polymorphs, with, the, same, chemical, formula, but, different, crystal, structures, held, together, by, an, organic, horn, like, compound, called, conchiolin, the, combination, of, aragonite, and, conchiolin, is, called, nacre, which, makes, up, mother, of, pearl, the, commonly, held, belief, that, a, grain, of, sand, acts, as, the, irritant, is, in, fact, rarely, the, case, typical, stimuli, include, organic, material, parasites, or, even, damage, that, displaces, mantle, tissue, to, another, part, of, the, mollusk, s, body, these, small, particles, or, organisms, gain, entry, when, the, shell, valves, are, open, for, feeding, or, respiration, in, cultured, pearls, the, irritant, is, typically, an, introduced, piece, of, the, mantle, epithelium, with, or, without, a, spherical, bead, beaded, or, beadless, cultured, pearls, natural, pearls, are, nearly, 100, calcium, carbonate, and, conchiolin, it, is, thought, that, natural, pearls, form, under, a, set, of, accidental, conditions, when, a, microscopic, intruder, or, parasite, enters, a, bivalve, mollusk, and, settles, inside, the, shell, the, mollusk, irritated, by, the, intruder, forms, a, pearl, sac, of, external, mantle, tissue, cells, and, secretes, the, calcium, carbonate, and, conchiolin, to, cover, the, irritant, this, secretion, process, is, repeated, many, times, thus, producing, a, pearl, natural, pearls, come, in, many, shapes, with, perfectly, round, ones, being, comparatively, rare, typically, the, build, up, of, a, natural, pearl, consists, of, a, brown, central, zone, formed, by, columnar, calcium, carbonate, usually, calcite, sometimes, columnar, aragonite, and, a, yellowish, to, white, outer, zone, consisting, of, nacre, tabular, aragonite, in, a, pearl, cross, section, such, as, the, diagram, these, two, different, materials, can, be, seen, the, presence, of, columnar, calcium, carbonate, rich, in, organic, material, indicates, juvenile, mantle, tissue, that, formed, during, the, early, stage, of, pearl, development, displaced, living, cells, with, a, well, defined, task, may, continue, to, perform, their, function, in, their, new, location, often, resulting, in, a, cyst, such, displacement, may, occur, via, an, injury, the, fragile, rim, of, the, shell, is, exposed, and, is, prone, to, damage, and, injury, crabs, other, predators, and, parasites, such, as, worm, larvae, may, produce, traumatic, attacks, and, cause, injuries, in, which, some, external, mantle, tissue, cells, are, disconnected, from, their, layer, embedded, in, the, conjunctive, tissue, of, the, mantle, these, cells, may, survive, and, form, a, small, pocket, in, which, they, continue, to, secrete, calcium, carbonate, their, natural, product, the, pocket, is, called, a, pearl, sac, and, grows, with, time, by, cell, division, the, juvenile, mantle, tissue, cells, according, to, their, stage, of, growth, secrete, columnar, calcium, carbonate, from, pearl, sac, s, inner, surface, in, time, the, pearl, sac, s, external, mantle, cells, proceed, to, the, formation, of, tabular, aragonite, when, the, transition, to, nacre, secretion, occurs, the, brown, pebble, becomes, covered, with, a, nacreous, coating, during, this, process, the, pearl, sac, seems, to, travel, into, the, shell, however, the, sac, actually, stays, in, its, original, relative, position, the, mantle, tissue, while, the, shell, itself, grows, after, a, couple, of, years, a, pearl, forms, and, the, shell, may, be, found, by, a, lucky, pearl, fisher, cultured, pearls, are, the, response, of, the, shell, to, a, tissue, implant, a, tiny, piece, of, mantle, tissue, called, a, graft, from, a, donor, shell, is, transplanted, into, a, recipient, shell, causing, a, pearl, sac, to, form, into, which, the, tissue, precipitates, calcium, carbonate, there, are, a, number, of, methods, for, producing, cultured, pearls, using, freshwater, or, seawater, shells, transplanting, the, graft, into, the, mantle, or, into, the, gonad, and, adding, a, spherical, bead, as, a, nucleus, most, saltwater, cultured, pearls, are, grown, with, beads, trade, names, of, cultured, pearls, are, akoya, white, or, golden, south, sea, and, black, tahitian, most, beadless, cultured, pearls, are, mantle, grown, in, freshwater, shells, in, china, and, are, known, as, freshwater, cultured, pearls, cultured, pearls, can, be, distinguished, from, natural, pearls, by, x, ray, examination, nucleated, cultured, pearls, are, often, preformed, as, they, tend, to, follow, the, shape, of, the, implanted, shell, bead, nucleus, after, a, bead, is, inserted, into, the, oyster, it, secretes, a, few, layers, of, nacre, around, the, bead, the, resulting, cultured, pearl, can, then, be, harvested, in, as, few, as, twelve, to, eighteen, months, when, a, cultured, pearl, with, a, bead, nucleus, is, x, rayed, it, reveals, a, different, structure, to, that, of, a, natural, pearl, a, beaded, cultured, pearl, shows, a, solid, center, with, no, concentric, growth, rings, whereas, a, natural, pearl, shows, a, series, of, concentric, growth, rings, a, beadless, cultured, pearl, whether, of, freshwater, or, saltwater, origin, may, show, growth, rings, but, also, a, complex, central, cavity, witness, of, the, first, precipitation, of, the, young, pearl, sac, some, imitation, pearls, also, called, shell, pearls, are, simply, made, of, mother, of, pearl, coral, or, conch, shell, while, others, are, made, from, glass, and, are, coated, with, a, solution, containing, fish, scales, called, essence, d, orient, a, well, equipped, gem, testing, laboratory, can, distinguish, natural, pearls, from, cultured, pearls, by, using, gemological, x, ray, equipment, to, examine, the, center, of, a, pearl, with, x, rays, it, is, possible, to, see, the, growth, rings, of, the, pearl, where, the, layers, of, calcium, carbonate, are, separated, by, thin, layers, of, conchiolin, the, differentiation, of, natural, pearls, from, non, beaded, cultured, pearls, can, be, very, difficult, without, the, use, of, this, x, ray, technique, natural, and, cultured, pearls, can, be, distinguished, from, imitation, pearls, using, a, microscope, another, method, of, testing, for, imitations, is, to, rub, two, pearls, against, each, other, imitation, pearls, are, completely, smooth, but, natural, and, cultured, pearls, are, composed, of, nacre, platelets, making, both, feel, slightly, gritty, fine, quality, natural, pearls, are, very, rare, jewels, their, values, are, determined, similarly, to, those, of, other, precious, gems, according, to, size, shape, color, quality, of, surface, orient, and, luster, single, natural, pearls, are, often, sold, as, collectors, items, or, set, as, centerpieces, in, unique, jewelry, very, few, matched, strands, of, natural, pearls, exist, and, those, that, do, often, sell, for, hundreds, of, thousands, of, dollars, in, 1917, jeweler, pierre, cartier, purchased, the, fifth, avenue, mansion, that, is, now, the, new, york, cartier, store, in, exchange, for, a, matched, double, strand, of, natural, pearls, cartier, had, been, collecting, for, years, at, the, time, it, was, valued, at, us, 1, million, the, introduction, and, advance, of, the, cultured, pearl, hit, the, pearl, industry, hard, pearl, dealers, publicly, disputed, the, authenticity, of, these, new, cultured, products, and, left, many, consumers, uneasy, and, confused, about, their, much, lower, prices, essentially, the, controversy, damaged, the, images, of, both, natural, and, cultured, pearls, by, the, 1950s, when, a, significant, number, of, women, in, developed, countries, could, afford, their, own, cultured, pearl, necklace, natural, pearls, were, reduced, to, a, small, exclusive, niche, in, the, pearl, industry, previously, natural, pearls, were, found, in, many, parts, of, the, world, present, day, natural, pearling, is, confined, mostly, to, seas, off, bahrain, australia, also, has, one, of, the, world, s, last, remaining, fleets, of, pearl, diving, ships, australian, pearl, divers, dive, for, south, sea, pearl, oysters, to, be, used, in, the, cultured, south, sea, pearl, industry, the, catch, of, pearl, oysters, is, similar, to, the, numbers, of, oysters, taken, during, the, natural, pearl, days, hence, significant, numbers, of, natural, pearls, are, still, found, in, the, australian, indian, ocean, waters, from, wild, oysters, x, ray, examination, is, required, to, positively, verify, natural, pearls, found, today, a, keshi, pearl, is, a, pearl, composed, entirely, of, nacre, and, results, from, mishaps, in, the, culturing, process, most, are, quite, small, typically, only, a, few, millimeters, in, diameter, and, are, often, irregular, in, shape, in, seeding, a, cultured, pearl, a, piece, of, mantle, muscle, from, a, sacrificed, oyster, is, placed, with, a, bead, of, mother, of, pearl, within, a, host, oyster, if, the, piece, of, mantle, should, slip, off, the, bead, a, keshi, pearl, forms, of, baroque, shape, about, the, mantle, piece, therefore, while, a, keshi, pearl, could, be, considered, superior, to, cultured, pearls, with, a, mother, of, pearl, bead, center, in, the, cultured, pearl, industry, the, oyster, s, resources, used, to, create, a, mistaken, all, nacre, baroque, pearl, is, a, drain, on, the, production, of, the, intended, round, cultured, pearl, therefore, the, pearl, industry, is, making, ongoing, attempts, to, improve, culturing, technique, so, that, keshi, pearls, do, not, occur, all, nacre, pearls, may, one, day, be, limited, to, natural, found, pearls, today, many, keshi, pearls, are, actually, intentional, with, post, harvest, shells, returned, to, the, water, to, regenerate, a, pearl, in, the, existing, pearl, sac, tahitian, pearls, frequently, referred, to, as, black, pearls, are, highly, valued, because, of, their, rarity, the, culturing, process, for, them, dictates, a, smaller, volume, output, and, they, can, never, be, mass, produced, because, in, common, with, most, sea, pearls, the, oyster, can, only, be, nucleated, with, one, pearl, at, a, time, while, freshwater, mussels, are, capable, of, multiple, pearl, implants, before, the, days, of, cultured, pearls, black, pearls, were, rare, and, highly, valued, for, the, simple, reason, that, white, pearl, oysters, rarely, produced, naturally, black, pearls, and, black, pearl, oysters, rarely, produced, any, natural, pearls, at, all, since, the, development, of, pearl, culture, technology, the, black, pearl, oysters, pinctada, margaritifera, found, in, tahiti, and, many, other, pacific, islands, including, the, cook, islands, and, fiji, are, being, extensively, used, for, producing, cultured, pearls, the, rarity, of, the, black, cultured, pearl, is, now, a, comparative, issue, the, black, cultured, pearl, is, rare, when, compared, to, chinese, freshwater, cultured, pearls, and, japanese, and, chinese, akoya, cultured, pearls, and, is, more, valuable, than, these, pearls, however, it, is, more, abundant, than, the, south, sea, pearl, which, is, more, valuable, than, the, black, cultured, pearl, this, is, simply, because, the, black, pearl, oyster, pinctada, margaritifera, is, far, more, abundant, than, the, elusive, rare, and, larger, south, sea, pearl, oyster, pinctada, maxima, which, cannot, be, found, in, lagoons, but, which, must, be, dived, for, in, a, rare, number, of, deep, ocean, habitats, or, grown, in, hatcheries, natural, black, pearls, are, rare, with, black, pearls, having, a, body, color, that, may, be, assessed, as, silver, silver, blue, gold, brown, black, green, black, or, black, black, cultured, pearls, from, the, black, pearl, oyster, pinctada, margaritifera, are, not, south, sea, pearls, although, they, are, often, mistakenly, described, as, black, south, sea, pearls, in, the, absence, of, an, official, definition, for, the, pearl, from, the, black, all, use, to, these, pearls, are, usually, referred, to, as, black, pearls, the, correct, definition, of, a, south, sea, pearl, as, described, by, cibjo, and, gia, is, a, pearl, produced, by, the, pinctada, maxima, pearl, oyster, south, sea, pearls, are, the, color, of, their, host, pinctada, maxima, oyster, and, can, be, white, silver, pink, gold, cream, and, any, combination, of, these, basic, colors, including, overtones, of, the, various, colors, of, the, rainbow, displayed, in, the, pearl, nacre, of, the, oyster, shell, itself, south, sea, pearls, are, the, largest, and, rarest, of, the, cultured, pearls, making, them, the, most, valuable, prized, for, their, exquisitely, beautiful, orient, or, lustre, south, sea, pearls, are, now, farmed, in, various, parts, of, the, world, where, the, pinctada, maxima, oysters, can, be, found, with, the, finest, south, sea, pearls, being, produced, by, paspaley, along, the, remote, coastline, of, north, western, australia, white, and, silver, colored, south, sea, pearls, tend, to, come, from, the, broome, area, of, australia, while, golden, colored, ones, are, more, prevalent, in, the, philippines, and, indonesia, a, farm, in, the, gulf, of, california, mexico, is, culturing, pearls, from, the, black, lipped, pinctada, mazatlanica, oysters, and, the, rainbow, lipped, pteria, sterna, oysters, also, called, concha, n, car, the, pearls, from, these, rainbow, lipped, oysters, fluoresce, red, under, ultraviolet, light, biologically, speaking, under, the, right, set, of, circumstances, almost, any, shelled, mollusk, can, produce, some, kind, of, pearl, however, most, of, these, molluskan, pearls, have, no, luster, or, iridescence, the, great, majority, of, mollusk, species, produce, pearls, which, are, not, attractive, and, are, sometimes, not, even, very, durable, such, pearls, usually, have, no, value, at, all, except, perhaps, to, a, scientist, or, collector, or, as, a, curiosity, these, objects, used, to, be, referred, to, as, calcareous, concretions, by, some, gemologists, even, though, a, malacologist, would, still, consider, them, to, be, pearls, valueless, pearls, of, this, type, are, sometimes, found, in, edible, mussels, edible, oysters, escargot, snails, and, so, on, the, gia, and, cibjo, now, simply, use, the, term, pearl, or, where, appropriate, the, more, descriptive, term, non, nacreous, pearl, when, referring, to, such, items, and, under, federal, trade, commission, rules, various, mollusk, pearls, may, be, referred, to, as, pearls, without, qualification, a, few, species, produce, pearls, that, can, be, of, interest, as, gemstones, these, species, include, the, bailer, shell, melo, the, giant, clam, tridacna, various, scallop, species, pen, shells, pinna, and, the, haliotis, iris, species, of, abalone, pearls, of, abalone, are, cultured, pearls, or, blister, pearls, unique, to, new, zealand, waters, and, are, commonly, referred, to, as, blue, pearls, they, are, admired, for, their, luster, and, naturally, bright, vibrant, colors, that, are, often, compared, to, opal, another, example, is, the, conch, pearl, sometimes, referred, to, simply, as, the, pink, pearl, which, is, found, very, rarely, growing, between, the, mantle, and, the, shell, of, the, queen, conch, or, pink, conch, strombus, gigas, a, large, sea, snail, or, marine, gastropod, from, the, caribbean, sea, these, pearls, which, are, often, pink, in, color, are, a, by, product, of, the, conch, fishing, industry, and, the, best, of, them, display, a, shimmering, optical, effect, related, to, chatoyance, known, as, flame, structure, somewhat, similar, gastropod, pearls, this, time, more, orange, in, hue, are, again, very, rarely, found, in, the, horse, conch, triplofusus, papillosus, the, second, largest, pearl, known, was, found, in, the, philippines, in, 1934, and, is, known, as, the, pearl, of, lao, tzu, it, is, a, naturally, occurring, non, nacreous, calcareous, concretion, pearl, from, a, giant, clam, because, it, did, not, grow, in, a, pearl, oyster, it, is, not, pearly, instead, the, surface, is, glossy, like, porcelain, other, pearls, from, giant, clams, are, known, to, exist, but, this, is, a, particularly, large, one, weighing, 14, lb, 6, 4, kg, the, largest, known, pearl, also, from, a, giant, clam, is, the, pearl, of, puerto, also, found, in, the, philippines, by, a, fisherman, from, puerto, princesa, palawan, island, the, enormous, pearl, is, 30, cm, wide, 1, ft, 67, cm, long, 2, 2, ft, and, weighs, 75, lb, 34, kg, the, ancient, chronicle, mahavamsa, mentions, the, thriving, pearl, industry, in, the, port, of, oruwella, in, the, gulf, of, mannar, in, sri, lanka, it, also, records, that, eight, varieties, of, pearls, accompanied, prince, vijaya, s, embassy, to, the, pandyan, king, as, well, as, king, devanampiya, tissa, s, embassy, to, emperor, ashoka, pliny, the, elder, 23, 79, ad, praised, the, pearl, fishery, of, the, gulf, as, most, productive, in, the, world, for, thousands, of, years, seawater, pearls, were, retrieved, by, divers, in, the, indian, ocean, in, areas, such, as, the, persian, gulf, the, red, sea, and, the, gulf, of, mannar, evidence, also, suggest, a, prehistoric, origin, to, pearl, diving, in, these, regions, starting, in, the, han, dynasty, 206, bc, 220, ad, the, chinese, hunted, extensively, for, seawater, pearls, in, the, south, china, sea, particularly, in, what, is, now, tolo, harbour, in, hong, kong, tanka, pearl, divers, of, twelfth, century, china, attached, ropes, to, their, waists, in, order, to, be, safely, brought, back, up, to, the, surface, when, spanish, conquistadors, arrived, in, the, western, hemisphere, they, discovered, that, around, the, islands, of, cubagua, and, margarita, some, 200, km, north, of, the, venezuelan, coast, was, an, extensive, pearl, bed, a, bed, of, pearl, oysters, one, discovered, and, named, pearl, la, peregrina, pearl, was, offered, to, philip, ii, of, spain, who, intended, to, give, it, as, a, gift, for, his, daughter, on, the, occasion, of, her, marriage, but, the, king, found, it, so, beautiful, that, he, kept, it, for, himself, later, he, elevated, it, to, be, part, of, the, spanish, crown, jewel, from, then, on, the, pearl, was, recorded, in, every, royal, inventory, for, more, than, 200, years, according, to, garcilasso, de, la, vega, who, says, that, he, saw, la, peregrina, at, seville, in, 1607, this, was, found, at, panama, in, 1560, by, a, slave, worker, who, was, rewarded, with, his, liberty, and, his, owner, with, the, office, of, alcalde, of, panama, margarita, pearls, are, extremely, difficult, to, find, today, and, are, known, for, their, unique, yellowish, color, before, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, pearl, hunting, was, the, most, common, way, of, harvesting, pearls, divers, manually, pulled, oysters, from, ocean, floors, and, river, bottoms, and, checked, them, individually, for, pearls, not, all, mussels, and, oysters, produce, pearls, in, a, haul, of, three, tons, only, three, or, four, oysters, will, produce, perfect, pearls, pearls, were, one, of, the, attractions, which, drew, julius, caesar, to, britain, they, are, for, the, most, part, freshwater, pearls, from, mussels, pearling, was, banned, in, the, u, k, in, 1998, due, to, the, endangered, status, of, river, mussels, discovery, and, publicity, about, the, sale, for, a, substantial, sum, of, the, abernethy, pearl, in, the, river, tay, had, resulted, in, heavy, exploitation, of, mussel, colonies, during, the, 1970s, and, 80s, by, weekend, warriors, when, it, was, permitted, it, was, carried, on, mainly, by, scottish, travellers, who, found, pearls, varied, from, river, to, river, with, the, river, oykel, in, the, highlands, being, noted, for, the, finest, rose, pink, pearls, there, are, two, firms, in, scotland, that, are, licensed, to, sell, pre, 1998, freshwater, pearls, today, the, cultured, pearls, on, the, market, can, be, divided, into, two, categories, the, first, category, covers, the, beaded, cultured, pearls, including, akoya, south, sea, and, tahiti, these, pearls, are, gonad, grown, and, usually, one, pearl, is, grown, at, a, time, this, limits, the, number, of, pearls, at, a, harvest, period, the, pearls, are, usually, harvested, after, one, year, for, akoya, 2, 4, years, for, tahitian, and, south, sea, and, 2, 7, years, for, freshwater, this, perliculture, process, was, first, developed, by, the, british, biologist, william, saville, kent, who, passed, the, information, along, to, tatsuhei, mise, and, tokichi, nishikawa, from, japan, the, second, category, includes, the, non, beaded, freshwater, cultured, pearls, like, the, biwa, or, chinese, pearls, as, they, grow, in, the, mantle, where, on, each, wing, up, to, 25, grafts, can, be, implanted, these, pearls, are, much, more, frequent, and, saturate, the, market, completely, an, impressive, improvement, in, quality, has, taken, place, over, ten, years, when, the, former, rice, grain, shaped, pebbles, are, compared, with, the, near, round, pearls, of, today, later, large, near, perfect, round, bead, nucleated, pearls, up, to, 15mm, in, diameter, have, been, produced, with, metallic, luster, the, nucleus, bead, in, a, beaded, cultured, pearl, is, generally, a, polished, sphere, made, from, freshwater, mussel, shell, along, with, a, small, piece, of, mantle, tissue, from, another, mollusk, donor, shell, to, serve, as, a, catalyst, for, the, pearl, sac, it, is, surgically, implanted, into, the, gonad, reproductive, organ, of, a, saltwater, mollusk, in, freshwater, perliculture, only, the, piece, of, tissue, is, used, in, most, cases, and, is, inserted, into, the, fleshy, mantle, of, the, host, mussel, south, sea, and, tahitian, pearl, oysters, also, known, as, pinctada, maxima, and, pinctada, margaritifera, which, survive, the, subsequent, surgery, to, remove, the, finished, pearl, are, often, implanted, with, a, new, larger, beads, as, part, of, the, same, procedure, and, then, returned, to, the, water, for, another, 2, 3, years, of, growth, despite, the, common, misperception, mikimoto, did, not, discover, the, process, of, pearl, culture, the, accepted, process, of, pearl, culture, was, developed, by, the, british, biologist, william, saville, kent, in, australia, and, brought, to, japan, by, tokichi, nishikawa, and, tatsuhei, mise, nishikawa, was, granted, the, patent, in, 1916, and, married, the, daughter, of, mikimoto, mikimoto, was, able, to, use, nishikawa, s, technology, after, the, patent, was, granted, in, 1916, the, technology, was, immediately, commercially, applied, to, akoya, pearl, oysters, in, japan, in, 1916, mise, s, brother, was, the, first, to, produce, a, commercial, crop, of, pearls, in, the, akoya, oyster, mitsubishi, s, baron, iwasaki, immediately, applied, the, technology, to, the, south, sea, pearl, oyster, in, 1917, in, the, philippines, and, later, in, buton, and, palau, mitsubishi, was, the, first, to, produce, a, cultured, south, sea, pearl, although, it, was, not, until, 1928, that, the, first, small, commercial, crop, of, pearls, was, successfully, produced, the, original, japanese, cultured, pearls, known, as, akoya, pearls, are, produced, by, a, species, of, small, pearl, oyster, pinctada, fucata, martensii, which, is, no, bigger, than, 6, to, 8, cm, 2, 4, to, 3, 1, in, in, size, hence, akoya, pearls, larger, than, 10, mm, in, diameter, are, extremely, rare, and, highly, priced, today, a, hybrid, mollusk, is, used, in, both, japan, and, china, in, the, production, of, akoya, pearls, cultured, pearls, were, sold, in, cans, for, the, export, market, these, were, packed, in, japan, by, the, i, c, p, canning, factory, international, pearl, company, l, t, d, in, nagasaki, pref, japan, mitsubishi, commenced, pearl, culture, with, the, south, sea, pearl, oyster, in, 1916, as, soon, as, the, technology, patent, was, commercialized, by, 1931, this, project, was, showing, signs, of, success, but, was, upset, by, the, death, of, tatsuhei, mise, although, the, project, was, recommenced, after, tatsuhei, s, death, the, project, was, discontinued, at, the, beginning, of, wwii, before, significant, productions, of, pearls, were, achieved, after, wwii, new, south, sea, pearl, projects, were, commenced, in, the, early, 1950s, at, kuri, bay, and, port, essington, in, australia, and, burma, japanese, companies, were, involved, in, all, projects, using, technicians, from, the, original, mitsubishi, south, sea, pre, war, projects, kuri, bay, is, now, the, location, of, one, of, the, largest, and, most, well, known, pearl, farms, owned, by, paspaley, the, biggest, producer, of, south, sea, pearls, in, the, world, in, 2010, china, overtook, japan, in, akoya, pearl, production, japan, has, all, but, ceased, its, production, of, akoya, pearls, smaller, than, 8, mm, japan, maintains, its, status, as, a, pearl, processing, center, however, and, imports, the, majority, of, chinese, akoya, pearl, production, these, pearls, are, then, processed, often, simply, matched, and, sorted, relabeled, as, product, of, japan, and, exported, in, the, past, two, decades, cultured, pearls, have, been, produced, using, larger, oysters, in, the, south, pacific, and, indian, ocean, the, largest, pearl, oyster, is, the, pinctada, maxima, which, is, roughly, the, size, of, a, dinner, plate, south, sea, pearls, are, characterized, by, their, large, size, and, warm, luster, sizes, up, to, 14, mm, in, diameter, are, not, uncommon, in, 2013, indonesia, pearl, supplied, 43, percent, of, south, sea, pearls, international, market, the, other, significant, producers, are, australia, philippines, myanmar, and, malaysia, in, 1914, pearl, farmers, began, growing, cultured, freshwater, pearls, using, the, pearl, mussels, native, to, lake, biwa, this, lake, the, largest, and, most, ancient, in, japan, lies, near, the, city, of, kyoto, the, extensive, and, successful, use, of, the, biwa, pearl, mussel, is, reflected, in, the, name, biwa, pearls, a, phrase, which, was, at, one, time, nearly, synonymous, with, freshwater, pearls, in, general, since, the, time, of, peak, production, in, 1971, when, biwa, pearl, farmers, produced, six, tons, of, cultured, pearls, pollution, has, caused, the, virtual, extinction, of, the, industry, japanese, pearl, farmers, recently, cultured, a, hybrid, pearl, mussel, a, cross, between, biwa, pearl, mussels, and, a, closely, related, species, from, china, hyriopsis, cumingi, in, lake, kasumigaura, this, industry, has, also, nearly, ceased, production, due, to, pollution, currently, the, belpearl, company, based, out, of, kobe, japan, continues, to, purchase, the, remaining, kasumiga, ura, pearls, japanese, pearl, producers, also, invested, in, producing, cultured, pearls, with, freshwater, mussels, in, the, region, of, shanghai, china, china, has, since, become, the, world, s, largest, producer, of, freshwater, pearls, producing, more, than, 1, 500, metric, tons, per, year, in, addition, to, metric, measurements, japanese, units, of, measurement, such, as, the, kan, and, momme, are, sometimes, encountered, in, the, pearl, industry, led, by, pearl, pioneer, john, latendresse, and, his, wife, chessy, the, united, states, began, farming, cultured, freshwater, pearls, in, the, mid, 1960s, national, geographic, magazine, introduced, the, american, cultured, pearl, as, a, commercial, product, in, their, august, 1985, issue, the, tennessee, pearl, farm, has, emerged, as, a, tourist, destination, in, recent, years, but, commercial, production, of, freshwater, pearls, has, ceased, for, many, cultured, pearl, dealers, and, wholesalers, the, preferred, weight, measure, used, for, loose, pearls, and, pearl, strands, is, the, momme, momme, is, a, weight, measure, used, by, the, japanese, for, centuries, today, momme, weight, is, still, the, standard, unit, of, measure, used, by, most, pearl, dealers, to, communicate, with, pearl, producers, and, wholesalers, one, momme, corresponds, to, 1, 1000, kan, reluctant, to, give, up, tradition, the, japanese, government, formalized, the, kan, measure, in, 1891, as, being, exactly, 3, 75, kilograms, or, 8, 28, pounds, hence, 1, momme, 3, 75, grams, or, 3750, milligrams, in, the, united, states, during, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, through, trade, with, japan, in, silk, cloth, the, momme, became, a, unit, indicating, the, quality, of, silk, cloth, though, millimeter, size, range, is, typically, the, first, factor, in, determining, a, cultured, pearl, necklace, s, value, the, momme, weight, of, pearl, necklace, will, allow, the, buyer, to, quickly, determine, if, the, necklace, is, properly, proportioned, this, is, especially, true, when, comparing, the, larger, south, sea, and, tahitian, pearl, necklaces, the, value, of, the, pearls, in, jewelry, is, determined, by, a, combination, of, the, luster, color, size, lack, of, surface, flaw, and, symmetry, that, are, appropriate, for, the, type, of, pearl, under, consideration, among, those, attributes, luster, is, the, most, important, differentiator, of, pearl, quality, according, to, jewelers, all, factors, being, equal, however, the, larger, the, pearl, the, more, valuable, it, is, large, perfectly, round, pearls, are, rare, and, highly, valued, teardrop, shaped, pearls, are, often, used, in, pendants, pearls, are, generally, of, spherical, shapes, perfectly, round, pearls, are, the, rarest, and, most, valuable, shape, semi, rounds, are, also, used, in, necklaces, or, in, pieces, where, the, shape, of, the, pearl, can, be, disguised, to, look, like, it, is, a, perfectly, round, pearl, button, pearls, are, like, a, slightly, flattened, round, pearl, and, can, also, make, a, necklace, but, are, more, often, used, in, single, pendants, or, earrings, where, the, back, half, of, the, pearl, is, covered, making, it, look, like, a, larger, rounder, pearl, pear, shaped, pearls, sometimes, look, like, teardrop, pearls, and, are, most, often, seen, in, earrings, pendants, or, as, a, center, pearl, in, a, necklace, baroque, pearls, have, a, different, appeal, they, are, often, highly, irregular, with, unique, and, interesting, shapes, they, are, also, commonly, seen, in, necklaces, circled, pearls, are, characterized, by, concentric, ridges, or, rings, around, the, body, of, the, pearl, in, general, cultured, pearls, are, less, valuable, than, natural, pearls, whereas, imitation, pearls, have, almost, no, value, one, way, that, jewelers, can, determine, whether, a, pearl, is, cultured, or, natural, is, to, have, a, gemlab, perform, an, x, ray, examination, of, the, pearl, if, x, rays, reveals, a, nucleus, the, pearl, is, likely, a, bead, nucleated, saltwater, pearl, if, no, nucleus, is, present, but, irregular, and, small, dark, inner, spots, indicating, a, cavity, are, visible, combined, with, concentric, rings, of, organic, substance, the, pearl, is, likely, a, cultured, freshwater, cultured, freshwater, pearls, can, often, be, confused, for, natural, pearls, which, present, as, homogeneous, pictures, which, continuously, darken, toward, the, surface, of, the, pearl, natural, pearls, will, often, show, larger, cavities, where, organic, matter, has, dried, out, and, decomposed, there, is, a, special, vocabulary, used, to, describe, the, length, of, pearl, necklaces, while, most, other, necklaces, are, simply, referred, to, by, their, physical, measurement, pearl, necklaces, are, named, by, how, low, they, hang, when, worn, around, the, neck, a, collar, measuring, 10, to, 13, inches, or, 25, to, 33, cm, in, length, sits, directly, against, the, throat, and, does, not, hang, down, the, neck, at, all, collars, are, often, made, up, of, multiple, strands, of, pearls, pearl, chokers, measuring, 14, to, 16, inches, or, 35, to, 41, cm, in, length, nestle, just, at, the, base, of, the, neck, a, strand, called, a, princess, length, measuring, 17, to, 19, inches, or, 43, to, 48, cm, in, length, comes, down, to, or, just, below, the, collarbone, a, matinee, length, measuring, 20, to, 24, inches, or, 50, to, 60, cm, in, length, falls, just, above, the, breasts, an, opera, length, measuring, 28, to, 35, inches, or, 70, to, 90, cm, in, length, will, be, long, enough, to, reach, the, breastbone, or, sternum, of, the, wearer, and, longer, still, a, pearl, rope, measuring, more, than, 45, inches, or, 115, cm, in, length, is, any, length, that, falls, down, farther, than, an, opera, necklaces, can, also, be, classified, as, uniform, or, graduated, in, a, uniform, strand, of, pearls, all, pearls, are, classified, as, the, same, size, but, actually, fall, in, a, range, a, uniform, strand, of, akoya, pearls, for, example, will, measure, within, 0, 5, mm, so, a, strand, will, never, be, 7, mm, but, will, be, 6, 5, 7, mm, freshwater, pearls, tahitian, pearls, and, south, sea, pearls, all, measure, to, a, full, millimeter, when, considered, uniform, a, graduated, strand, of, pearls, most, often, has, at, least, 3, mm, of, differentiation, from, the, ends, to, the, center, of, the, necklace, popularized, in, the, united, states, during, the, 1950s, by, the, gis, bringing, strands, of, cultured, akoya, pearls, home, from, japan, a, 3, 5, momme, 3, mm, to, 7, mm, graduated, strand, was, much, more, affordable, than, a, uniform, strand, because, most, of, the, pearls, were, small, earrings, and, necklaces, can, also, be, classified, on, the, grade, of, the, color, of, the, pearl, saltwater, and, freshwater, pearls, come, in, many, different, colors, while, white, and, more, recently, black, saltwater, pearls, are, by, far, the, most, popular, other, color, tints, can, be, found, on, pearls, from, the, oceans, pink, blue, champagne, green, and, even, purple, saltwater, pearls, can, be, encountered, but, to, collect, enough, of, these, rare, colors, to, form, a, complete, string, of, the, same, size, and, same, shade, can, take, years, the, vast, majority, of, inexpensive, colored, pearls, have, been, subjected, to, some, form, of, dye, often, a, fabric, dye, this, dye, will, only, tend, to, penetrate, the, first, layer, or, two, of, nacre, but, this, is, enough, to, impart, vivid, and, sometimes, garish, color, to, otherwise, white, pearls, truly, valuable, pearls, are, never, dyed, and, this, process, is, not, believed, to, add, and, in, most, cases, would, only, subtract, from, their, market, value, the, hindu, tradition, describes, the, sacred, nine, pearls, which, were, first, documented, in, the, garuda, purana, one, of, the, books, of, the, hindu, scriptures, ayurveda, contains, references, to, pearl, powder, as, a, stimulant, of, digestion, and, to, treat, mental, ailments, according, to, marco, polo, the, kings, of, malabar, wore, a, necklace, of, 108, rubies, and, pearls, which, was, given, from, one, generation, of, kings, to, the, next, the, reason, was, that, every, king, had, to, say, 108, prayers, every, morning, and, every,
