an, electromagnet, is, a, type, of, magnet, in, which, the, magnetic, field, is, produced, by, an, electric, current, electromagnets, usually, consist, of, wire, wound, into, a, coil, a, current, through, the, wire, creates, a, magnetic, field, which, is, concentrated, in, the, hole, in, the, center, of, the, coil, the, magnetic, field, disappears, when, the, current, is, turned, off, the, wire, turns, are, often, wound, around, a, magnetic, core, made, from, a, ferromagnetic, or, ferrimagnetic, material, such, as, iron, the, magnetic, core, concentrates, the, magnetic, flux, and, makes, a, more, powerful, magnet, the, main, advantage, of, an, electromagnet, over, a, permanent, magnet, is, that, the, magnetic, field, can, be, quickly, changed, by, controlling, the, amount, of, electric, current, in, the, winding, however, unlike, a, permanent, magnet, that, needs, no, power, an, electromagnet, requires, a, continuous, supply, of, current, to, maintain, the, magnetic, field, electromagnets, are, widely, used, as, components, of, other, electrical, devices, such, as, motors, generators, electromechanical, solenoids, relays, loudspeakers, hard, disks, mri, machines, scientific, instruments, and, magnetic, separation, equipment, electromagnets, are, also, employed, in, industry, for, picking, up, and, moving, heavy, iron, objects, such, as, scrap, iron, and, steel, danish, scientist, hans, christian, rsted, discovered, in, 1820, that, electric, currents, create, magnetic, fields, in, the, same, year, the, french, scientist, andr, marie, amp, re, showed, that, iron, can, be, magnetized, by, inserting, it, in, an, electrically, fed, solenoid, british, scientist, william, sturgeon, invented, the, electromagnet, in, 1824, his, first, electromagnet, was, a, horseshoe, shaped, piece, of, iron, that, was, wrapped, with, about, 18, turns, of, bare, copper, wire, insulated, wire, did, not, then, exist, the, iron, was, varnished, to, insulate, it, from, the, windings, when, a, current, was, passed, through, the, coil, the, iron, became, magnetized, and, attracted, other, pieces, of, iron, when, the, current, was, stopped, it, lost, magnetization, sturgeon, displayed, its, power, by, showing, that, although, it, only, weighed, seven, ounces, roughly, 200, grams, it, could, lift, nine, pounds, roughly, 4, kilos, when, the, current, of, a, single, cell, power, supply, was, applied, however, sturgeon, s, magnets, were, weak, because, the, uninsulated, wire, he, used, could, only, be, wrapped, in, a, single, spaced, out, layer, around, the, core, limiting, the, number, of, turns, beginning, in, 1830, us, scientist, joseph, henry, systematically, improved, and, popularised, the, electromagnet, by, using, wire, insulated, by, silk, thread, and, inspired, by, schweigger, s, use, of, multiple, turns, of, wire, to, make, a, galvanometer, he, was, able, to, wind, multiple, layers, of, wire, onto, cores, creating, powerful, magnets, with, thousands, of, turns, of, wire, including, one, that, could, support, 2, 063, lb, 936, kg, the, first, major, use, for, electromagnets, was, in, telegraph, sounders, the, magnetic, domain, theory, of, how, ferromagnetic, cores, work, was, first, proposed, in, 1906, by, french, physicist, pierre, ernest, weiss, and, the, detailed, modern, quantum, mechanical, theory, of, ferromagnetism, was, worked, out, in, the, 1920s, by, werner, heisenberg, lev, landau, felix, bloch, and, others, a, portative, electromagnet, is, one, designed, to, just, hold, material, in, place, an, example, is, a, lifting, magnet, a, tractive, electromagnet, applies, a, force, and, moves, something, electromagnets, are, very, widely, used, in, electric, and, electromechanical, devices, including, a, common, tractive, electromagnet, is, a, uniformly, wound, solenoid, and, plunger, the, solenoid, is, a, coil, of, wire, and, the, plunger, is, made, of, a, material, such, as, soft, iron, applying, a, current, to, the, solenoid, applies, a, force, to, the, plunger, and, may, make, it, move, the, plunger, stops, moving, when, the, forces, upon, it, are, balanced, for, example, the, forces, are, balanced, when, the, plunger, is, centered, in, the, solenoid, the, maximum, uniform, pull, happens, when, one, end, of, the, plunger, is, at, the, middle, of, the, solenoid, an, approximation, for, the, force, f, is, where, c, is, a, proportionality, constant, a, is, the, cross, sectional, area, of, the, plunger, n, is, the, number, of, turns, in, the, solenoid, i, is, the, current, through, the, solenoid, wire, and, is, the, length, of, the, solenoid, for, units, using, inches, pounds, force, and, amperes, with, long, slender, solenoids, the, value, of, c, is, around, 0, 009, to, 0, 010, psi, maximum, pull, pounds, per, square, inch, of, plunger, cross, sectional, area, for, example, a, 12, inch, long, coil, 12, in, with, a, long, plunger, of, 1, square, inch, cross, section, a, 1, in, 2, and, 11, 200, ampere, turns, n, i, 11, 200, aturn, had, a, maximum, pull, of, 8, 75, pounds, corresponding, to, c, 0, 0094, psi, the, maximum, pull, is, increased, when, a, magnetic, stop, is, inserted, into, the, solenoid, the, stop, becomes, a, magnet, that, will, attract, the, plunger, it, adds, little, to, the, solenoid, pull, when, the, plunger, is, far, away, but, dramatically, increases, the, pull, when, they, are, close, an, approximation, for, the, pull, p, is, here, a, is, the, distance, between, the, end, of, the, stop, and, the, end, of, the, plunger, the, additional, constant, c, 1, for, units, of, inches, pounds, and, amperes, with, slender, solenoids, is, about, 2660, the, second, term, within, the, bracket, represents, the, same, force, as, the, stop, less, solenoid, above, the, first, term, represents, the, attraction, between, the, stop, and, the, plunger, some, improvements, can, be, made, on, the, basic, design, the, ends, of, the, stop, and, plunger, are, often, conical, for, example, the, plunger, may, have, a, pointed, end, that, fits, into, a, matching, recess, in, the, stop, the, shape, makes, the, solenoid, s, pull, more, uniform, as, a, function, of, separation, another, improvement, is, to, add, a, magnetic, return, path, around, the, outside, of, the, solenoid, an, iron, clad, solenoid, the, magnetic, return, path, just, as, the, stop, has, little, impact, until, the, air, gap, is, small, an, electric, current, flowing, in, a, wire, creates, a, magnetic, field, around, the, wire, due, to, ampere, s, law, see, drawing, of, wire, with, magnetic, field, to, concentrate, the, magnetic, field, in, an, electromagnet, the, wire, is, wound, into, a, coil, with, many, turns, of, wire, lying, side, by, side, the, magnetic, field, of, all, the, turns, of, wire, passes, through, the, center, of, the, coil, creating, a, strong, magnetic, field, there, a, coil, forming, the, shape, of, a, straight, tube, a, helix, is, called, a, solenoid, the, direction, of, the, magnetic, field, through, a, coil, of, wire, can, be, found, from, a, form, of, the, right, hand, rule, if, the, fingers, of, the, right, hand, are, curled, around, the, coil, in, the, direction, of, current, flow, conventional, current, flow, of, positive, charge, through, the, windings, the, thumb, points, in, the, direction, of, the, field, inside, the, coil, the, side, of, the, magnet, that, the, field, lines, emerge, from, is, defined, to, be, the, north, pole, for, definitions, of, the, variables, below, see, box, at, end, of, article, much, stronger, magnetic, fields, can, be, produced, if, a, magnetic, core, of, a, soft, ferromagnetic, or, ferrimagnetic, material, such, as, iron, is, placed, inside, the, coil, a, core, can, increase, the, magnetic, field, to, thousands, of, times, the, strength, of, the, field, of, the, coil, alone, due, to, the, high, magnetic, permeability, of, the, material, not, all, electromagnets, use, cores, so, this, is, called, a, ferromagnetic, core, or, iron, core, electromagnet, this, is, because, the, material, of, a, magnetic, core, often, made, of, iron, or, steel, is, composed, of, small, regions, called, magnetic, domains, that, act, like, tiny, magnets, see, ferromagnetism, before, the, current, in, the, electromagnet, is, turned, on, the, domains, in, the, soft, iron, core, point, in, random, directions, so, their, tiny, magnetic, fields, cancel, each, other, out, and, the, iron, has, no, large, scale, magnetic, field, when, a, current, is, passed, through, the, wire, wrapped, around, the, iron, its, magnetic, field, penetrates, the, iron, and, causes, the, domains, to, turn, aligning, parallel, to, the, magnetic, field, so, their, tiny, magnetic, fields, add, to, the, wire, s, field, creating, a, large, magnetic, field, that, extends, into, the, space, around, the, magnet, the, effect, of, the, core, is, to, concentrate, the, field, and, the, magnetic, field, passes, through, the, core, in, lower, reluctance, than, when, it, would, pass, through, air, the, larger, the, current, passed, through, the, wire, coil, the, more, the, domains, align, and, the, stronger, the, magnetic, field, is, finally, all, the, domains, are, lined, up, and, further, increases, in, current, only, cause, slight, increases, in, the, magnetic, field, this, phenomenon, is, called, saturation, this, is, why, the, very, strongest, electromagnets, such, as, superconducting, and, very, high, current, electromagnets, cannot, use, cores, the, main, nonlinear, feature, of, ferromagnetic, materials, is, that, the, b, field, saturates, at, a, certain, value, which, is, around, 1, 6, to, 2, teslas, t, for, most, high, permeability, core, steels, the, b, field, increases, quickly, with, increasing, current, up, to, that, value, but, above, that, value, the, field, levels, off, and, becomes, almost, constant, regardless, of, how, much, current, is, sent, through, the, windings, the, maximum, strength, of, the, magnetic, field, possible, from, an, iron, core, electromagnet, is, limited, to, around, 1, 6, to, 2, t, when, the, current, in, the, coil, is, turned, off, in, the, magnetically, soft, materials, that, are, nearly, always, used, as, cores, most, of, the, domains, lose, alignment, and, return, to, a, random, state, and, the, field, disappears, however, some, of, the, alignment, persists, because, the, domains, have, difficulty, turning, their, direction, of, magnetization, leaving, the, core, magnetized, as, a, weak, permanent, magnet, this, phenomenon, is, called, hysteresis, and, the, remaining, magnetic, field, is, called, remanent, magnetism, the, residual, magnetization, of, the, core, can, be, removed, by, degaussing, in, alternating, current, electromagnets, such, as, are, used, in, motors, the, core, s, magnetization, is, constantly, reversed, and, the, remanence, contributes, to, the, motor, s, losses, the, magnetic, field, of, electromagnets, in, the, general, case, is, given, by, ampere, s, law, which, says, that, the, integral, of, the, magnetizing, field, h, displaystyle, mathbf, h, around, any, closed, loop, is, equal, to, the, sum, of, the, current, flowing, through, the, loop, another, equation, used, that, gives, the, magnetic, field, due, to, each, small, segment, of, current, is, the, biot, savart, law, likewise, on, the, solenoid, the, force, exerted, by, an, electromagnet, on, a, conductor, located, at, a, section, of, core, material, is, the, force, equation, can, be, derived, from, the, energy, stored, in, a, magnetic, field, energy, is, force, times, distance, rearranging, terms, yields, the, equation, above, the, 1, 6, t, limit, on, the, field, mentioned, above, sets, a, limit, on, the, maximum, force, per, unit, core, area, or, magnetic, pressure, an, iron, core, electromagnet, can, exert, roughly, for, saturation, limit, of, the, core, b, sat, in, more, intuitive, units, it, is, useful, to, remember, that, at, 1, t, the, magnetic, pressure, is, approximately, 4, atmospheres, or, kg, cm, 2, given, a, core, geometry, the, b, field, needed, for, a, given, force, can, be, calculated, from, 1, if, it, comes, out, to, much, more, than, 1, 6, t, a, larger, core, must, be, used, however, computing, the, magnetic, field, and, force, exerted, by, ferromagnetic, materials, in, general, is, difficult, for, two, reasons, first, because, the, strength, of, the, field, varies, from, point, to, point, in, a, complicated, way, particularly, outside, the, core, and, in, air, gaps, where, fringing, fields, and, leakage, flux, must, be, considered, second, because, the, magnetic, field, b, and, force, are, nonlinear, functions, of, the, current, depending, on, the, nonlinear, relation, between, b, and, h, for, the, particular, core, material, used, for, precise, calculations, computer, programs, that, can, produce, a, model, of, the, magnetic, field, using, the, finite, element, method, are, employed, in, many, practical, applications, of, electromagnets, such, as, motors, generators, transformers, lifting, magnets, and, loudspeakers, the, iron, core, is, in, the, form, of, a, loop, or, magnetic, circuit, possibly, broken, by, a, few, narrow, air, gaps, iron, presents, much, less, resistance, reluctance, to, the, magnetic, field, than, air, so, a, stronger, field, can, be, obtained, if, most, of, the, magnetic, field, s, path, is, within, the, core, this, is, why, the, core, and, magnetic, field, lines, are, in, the, form, of, closed, loops, since, most, of, the, magnetic, field, is, confined, within, the, outlines, of, the, core, loop, this, allows, a, simplification, of, the, mathematical, analysis, see, the, drawing, at, right, a, common, simplifying, assumption, satisfied, by, many, electromagnets, which, will, be, used, in, this, section, is, that, the, magnetic, field, strength, b, is, constant, around, the, magnetic, circuit, within, the, core, and, air, gaps, and, zero, outside, it, most, of, the, magnetic, field, will, be, concentrated, in, the, core, material, c, within, the, core, the, magnetic, field, b, will, be, approximately, uniform, across, any, cross, section, so, if, in, addition, the, core, has, roughly, constant, area, throughout, its, length, the, field, in, the, core, will, be, constant, this, leaves, the, air, gaps, g, if, any, between, core, sections, in, the, gaps, the, magnetic, field, lines, are, no, longer, confined, by, the, core, so, they, bulge, out, beyond, the, outlines, of, the, core, before, curving, back, to, enter, the, next, piece, of, core, material, reducing, the, field, strength, in, the, gap, the, bulges, b, f, are, called, fringing, fields, however, as, long, as, the, length, of, the, gap, is, smaller, than, the, cross, section, dimensions, of, the, core, the, field, in, the, gap, will, be, approximately, the, same, as, in, the, core, in, addition, some, of, the, magnetic, field, lines, b, l, will, take, short, cuts, and, not, pass, through, the, entire, core, circuit, and, thus, will, not, contribute, to, the, force, exerted, by, the, magnet, this, also, includes, field, lines, that, encircle, the, wire, windings, but, do, not, enter, the, core, this, is, called, leakage, flux, the, equations, in, this, section, are, valid, for, electromagnets, for, which, the, magnetic, field, created, by, an, electromagnet, is, proportional, to, both, n, and, i, hence, this, product, ni, is, given, the, name, magnetomotive, force, for, an, electromagnet, with, a, single, magnetic, circuit, ampere, s, law, reduces, to, this, is, a, nonlinear, equation, because, varies, with, b, for, an, exact, solution, the, value, of, at, the, b, value, used, must, be, obtained, from, the, core, material, hysteresis, curve, if, b, is, unknown, the, equation, must, be, solved, by, numerical, methods, moreover, if, the, magnetomotive, force, is, well, above, saturation, so, the, core, material, is, in, saturation, the, magnetic, field, will, be, approximately, the, saturation, value, b, sat, for, the, material, and, would, not, vary, much, with, changes, in, ni, for, a, closed, magnetic, circuit, no, air, gap, most, core, materials, saturate, at, a, magnetomotive, force, of, roughly, 800, ampere, turns, per, meter, of, flux, path, for, most, core, materials, r, 2000, 6000, displaystyle, mu, r, approx, 2000, text, 6000, so, in, equation, 2, above, the, second, term, dominates, therefore, in, magnetic, circuits, with, an, air, gap, b, depends, strongly, on, the, length, of, the, air, gap, and, the, length, of, the, flux, path, in, the, core, does, not, matter, much, given, an, air, gap, of, 1mm, a, magnetomotive, force, of, about, 796, ampere, turns, is, required, to, produce, a, magnetic, field, of, 1t, for, a, closed, magnetic, circuit, no, air, gap, such, as, would, be, found, in, an, electromagnet, lifting, a, piece, of, iron, bridged, across, its, poles, equation, 2, becomes, substituting, into, 1, the, force, is, it, can, be, seen, that, to, maximize, the, force, a, core, with, a, short, flux, path, l, and, a, wide, cross, sectional, area, a, is, preferred, this, also, applies, to, magnets, with, an, air, gap, to, achieve, this, in, applications, like, lifting, magnets, see, photo, above, and, loudspeakers, a, flat, cylindrical, design, is, often, used, the, winding, is, wrapped, around, a, short, wide, cylindrical, core, that, forms, one, pole, and, a, thick, metal, housing, that, wraps, around, the, outside, of, the, windings, forms, the, other, part, of, the, magnetic, circuit, bringing, the, magnetic, field, to, the, front, to, form, the, other, pole, the, above, methods, are, applicable, to, electromagnets, with, a, magnetic, circuit, and, do, not, apply, when, a, large, part, of, the, magnetic, field, path, is, outside, the, core, a, non, circuit, example, would, be, a, magnet, with, a, straight, cylindrical, core, like, the, one, shown, at, the, top, of, this, article, only, focusing, on, the, force, between, two, electromagnets, or, permanent, magnets, with, well, defined, poles, where, the, field, lines, emerge, from, the, core, a, special, analogy, called, a, magnetic, charge, model, which, assumes, the, magnetic, field, is, produced, by, fictitious, magnetic, charges, on, the, surface, of, the, poles, this, model, assumes, point, like, poles, instead, of, the, really, existing, surfaces, and, thus, it, only, yields, a, good, approximation, when, the, distance, between, the, magnets, is, much, larger, than, their, diameter, so, it, is, useful, just, for, a, force, between, them, magnetic, pole, strength, of, electromagnets, can, be, found, from, m, n, i, a, l, displaystyle, m, frac, nia, l, the, force, between, two, poles, is, f, 0, m, 1, m, 2, 4, r, 2, displaystyle, f, frac, mu, 0, m, 1, m, 2, 4, pi, r, 2, each, electromagnet, has, two, poles, so, the, total, force, on, a, given, magnet, due, to, another, magnet, is, equal, to, the, vector, sum, of, the, forces, of, the, other, magnet, s, poles, acting, on, each, pole, of, the, given, magnet, there, are, several, side, effects, which, occur, in, electromagnets, which, must, be, provided, for, in, their, design, these, generally, become, more, significant, in, larger, electromagnets, the, only, power, consumed, in, a, dc, electromagnet, under, steady, state, conditions, is, due, to, the, resistance, of, the, windings, and, is, dissipated, as, heat, some, large, electromagnets, require, water, cooling, systems, in, the, windings, to, carry, off, the, waste, heat, since, the, magnetic, field, is, proportional, to, the, product, ni, the, number, of, turns, in, the, windings, n, and, the, current, i, can, be, chosen, to, minimize, heat, losses, as, long, as, their, product, is, constant, since, the, power, dissipation, p, i, 2, r, increases, with, the, square, of, the, current, but, only, increases, approximately, linearly, with, the, number, of, windings, the, power, lost, in, the, windings, can, be, minimized, by, reducing, i, and, increasing, the, number, of, turns, n, proportionally, or, using, thicker, wire, to, reduce, the, resistance, for, example, halving, i, and, doubling, n, halves, the, power, loss, as, does, doubling, the, area, of, the, wire, in, either, case, increasing, the, amount, of, wire, reduces, the, ohmic, losses, for, this, reason, electromagnets, often, have, a, significant, thickness, of, windings, however, the, limit, to, increasing, n, or, lowering, the, resistance, is, that, the, windings, take, up, more, room, between, the, magnet, s, core, pieces, if, the, area, available, for, the, windings, is, filled, up, more, turns, require, going, to, a, smaller, diameter, of, wire, which, has, higher, resistance, which, cancels, the, advantage, of, using, more, turns, so, in, large, magnets, there, is, a, minimum, amount, of, heat, loss, that, cannot, be, reduced, this, increases, with, the, square, of, the, magnetic, flux, b, 2, an, electromagnet, has, significant, inductance, and, resists, changes, in, the, current, through, its, windings, any, sudden, changes, in, the, winding, current, cause, large, voltage, spikes, across, the, windings, this, is, because, when, the, current, through, the, magnet, is, increased, such, as, when, it, is, turned, on, energy, from, the, circuit, must, be, stored, in, the, magnetic, field, when, it, is, turned, off, the, energy, in, the, field, is, returned, to, the, circuit, if, an, ordinary, switch, is, used, to, control, the, winding, current, this, can, cause, sparks, at, the, terminals, of, the, switch, this, does, not, occur, when, the, magnet, is, switched, on, because, the, limited, supply, voltage, causes, the, current, through, the, magnet, and, the, field, energy, to, increase, slowly, but, when, it, is, switched, off, the, energy, in, the, magnetic, field, is, suddenly, returned, to, the, circuit, causing, a, large, voltage, spike, and, an, arc, across, the, switch, contacts, which, can, damage, them, with, small, electromagnets, a, capacitor, is, sometimes, used, across, the, contacts, which, reduces, arcing, by, temporarily, storing, the, current, more, often, a, diode, is, used, to, prevent, voltage, spikes, by, providing, a, path, for, the, current, to, recirculate, through, the, winding, until, the, energy, is, dissipated, as, heat, the, diode, is, connected, across, the, winding, oriented, so, it, is, reverse, biased, during, steady, state, operation, and, does, not, conduct, when, the, supply, voltage, is, removed, the, voltage, spike, forward, biases, the, diode, and, the, reactive, current, continues, to, flow, through, the, winding, through, the, diode, and, back, into, the, winding, a, diode, used, in, this, way, is, called, a, freewheeling, diode, or, flyback, diode, large, electromagnets, are, usually, powered, by, variable, current, electronic, power, supplies, controlled, by, a, microprocessor, which, prevent, voltage, spikes, by, accomplishing, current, changes, slowly, in, gentle, ramps, it, may, take, several, minutes, to, energize, or, deenergize, a, large, magnet, in, powerful, electromagnets, the, magnetic, field, exerts, a, force, on, each, turn, of, the, windings, due, to, the, lorentz, force, q, v, b, displaystyle, q, mathbf, v, times, mathbf, b, acting, on, the, moving, charges, within, the, wire, the, lorentz, force, is, perpendicular, to, both, the, axis, of, the, wire, and, the, magnetic, field, it, can, be, visualized, as, a, pressure, between, the, magnetic, field, lines, pushing, them, apart, it, has, two, effects, on, an, electromagnet, s, windings, the, lorentz, forces, increase, with, b, 2, in, large, electromagnets, the, windings, must, be, firmly, clamped, in, place, to, prevent, motion, on, power, up, and, power, down, from, causing, metal, fatigue, in, the, windings, in, the, bitter, design, below, used, in, very, high, field, research, magnets, the, windings, are, constructed, as, flat, disks, to, resist, the, radial, forces, and, clamped, in, an, axial, direction, to, resist, the, axial, ones, in, alternating, current, ac, electromagnets, used, in, transformers, inductors, and, ac, motors, and, generators, the, magnetic, field, is, constantly, changing, this, causes, energy, losses, in, their, magnetic, cores, that, is, dissipated, as, heat, in, the, core, the, losses, stem, from, two, processes, when, a, magnetic, field, higher, than, the, ferromagnetic, limit, of, 1, 6, t, is, needed, superconducting, electromagnets, can, be, used, instead, of, using, ferromagnetic, materials, these, use, superconducting, windings, cooled, with, liquid, helium, which, conduct, current, without, electrical, resistance, these, allow, enormous, currents, to, flow, which, generate, intense, magnetic, fields, superconducting, magnets, are, limited, by, the, field, strength, at, which, the, winding, material, ceases, to, be, superconducting, current, designs, are, limited, to, 10, 20, t, with, the, current, 2017, record, of, 32, t, the, necessary, refrigeration, equipment, and, cryostat, make, them, much, more, expensive, than, ordinary, electromagnets, however, in, high, power, applications, this, can, be, offset, by, lower, operating, costs, since, after, startup, no, power, is, required, for, the, windings, since, no, energy, is, lost, to, ohmic, heating, they, are, used, in, particle, accelerators, and, mri, machines, both, iron, core, and, superconducting, electromagnets, have, limits, to, the, field, they, can, produce, therefore, the, most, powerful, man, made, magnetic, fields, have, been, generated, by, air, core, nonsuperconducting, electromagnets, of, a, design, invented, by, francis, bitter, in, 1933, called, bitter, electromagnets, instead, of, wire, windings, a, bitter, magnet, consists, of, a, solenoid, made, of, a, stack, of, conducting, disks, arranged, so, that, the, current, moves, in, a, helical, path, through, them, with, a, hole, through, the, center, where, the, maximum, field, is, created, this, design, has, the, mechanical, strength, to, withstand, the, extreme, lorentz, forces, of, the, field, which, increase, with, b, 2, the, disks, are, pierced, with, holes, through, which, cooling, water, passes, to, carry, away, the, heat, caused, by, the, high, current, the, strongest, continuous, field, achieved, solely, with, a, resistive, magnet, is, 41, 5, tesla, as, of, 22, august, 2017, produced, by, a, bitter, electromagnet, at, the, national, high, magnetic, field, laboratory, in, tallahassee, florida, the, previous, record, was, 37, 5, t, the, strongest, continuous, magnetic, field, overall, 45, t, was, achieved, in, june, 2000, with, a, hybrid, device, consisting, of, a, bitter, magnet, inside, a, superconducting, magnet, the, factor, limiting, the, strength, of, electromagnets, is, the, inability, to, dissipate, the, enormous, waste, heat, so, more, powerful, fields, up, to, 100, t, have, been, obtained, from, resistive, magnets, by, sending, brief, pulses, of, high, current, through, them, the, inactive, period, after, each, pulse, allows, the, heat, produced, during, the, pulse, to, be, removed, before, the, next, pulse, the, most, powerful, manmade, magnetic, fields, have, been, created, by, using, explosives, to, compress, the, magnetic, field, inside, an, electromagnet, as, it, is, pulsed, these, are, called, explosively, pumped, flux, compression, generators, the, implosion, compresses, the, magnetic, field, to, values, of, around, 1000, t, for, a, few, microseconds, while, this, method, may, seem, very, destructive, charge, shaping, redirects, the, blast, outwardly, to, minimize, harm, to, the, experiment, these, devices, are, known, as, destructive, pulsed, electromagnets, they, are, used, in, physics, and, materials, science, research, to, study, the, properties, of, materials, at, high, magnetic, fields
