in, organic, chemistry, ethers, are, a, class, of, compounds, that, contain, an, ether, group, an, oxygen, atom, bonded, to, two, organyl, groups, e, g, alkyl, or, aryl, they, have, the, general, formula, r, o, r, where, r, and, r, represent, the, organyl, groups, ethers, can, again, be, classified, into, two, varieties, if, the, organyl, groups, are, the, same, on, both, sides, of, the, oxygen, atom, then, it, is, a, simple, or, symmetrical, ether, whereas, if, they, are, different, the, ethers, are, called, mixed, or, unsymmetrical, ethers, a, typical, example, of, the, first, group, is, the, solvent, and, anaesthetic, diethyl, ether, commonly, referred, to, simply, as, ether, ch, 3, ch, 2, o, ch, 2, ch, 3, ethers, are, common, in, organic, chemistry, and, even, more, prevalent, in, biochemistry, as, they, are, common, linkages, in, carbohydrates, and, lignin, ethers, feature, bent, c, o, c, linkages, in, dimethyl, ether, the, bond, angle, is, 111, and, c, o, distances, are, 141, pm, the, barrier, to, rotation, about, the, c, o, bonds, is, low, the, bonding, of, oxygen, in, ethers, alcohols, and, water, is, similar, in, the, language, of, valence, bond, theory, the, hybridization, at, oxygen, is, sp, 3, oxygen, is, more, electronegative, than, carbon, thus, the, alpha, hydrogens, of, ethers, are, more, acidic, than, those, of, simple, hydrocarbons, they, are, far, less, acidic, than, alpha, hydrogens, of, carbonyl, groups, such, as, in, ketones, or, aldehydes, however, ethers, can, be, symmetrical, of, the, type, ror, or, unsymmetrical, of, the, type, ror, examples, of, the, former, are, dimethyl, ether, diethyl, ether, dipropyl, ether, etc, illustrative, unsymmetrical, ethers, are, anisole, methoxybenzene, and, dimethoxyethane, vinyl, and, acetylenic, ethers, are, far, less, common, than, alkyl, or, aryl, ethers, vinylethers, often, called, enol, ethers, are, important, intermediates, in, organic, synthesis, acetylenic, ethers, are, especially, rare, di, tert, butoxyacetylene, is, the, most, common, example, of, this, rare, class, of, compounds, in, the, iupac, nomenclature, system, ethers, are, named, using, the, general, formula, alkoxyalkane, for, example, ch, 3, ch, 2, o, ch, 3, is, methoxyethane, if, the, ether, is, part, of, a, more, complex, molecule, it, is, described, as, an, alkoxy, substituent, so, och, 3, would, be, considered, a, methoxy, group, the, simpler, alkyl, radical, is, written, in, front, so, ch, 3, o, ch, 2, ch, 3, would, be, given, as, methoxy, ch, 3, o, ethane, ch, 2, ch, 3, iupac, rules, are, often, not, followed, for, simple, ethers, the, trivial, names, for, simple, ethers, i, e, those, with, none, or, few, other, functional, groups, are, a, composite, of, the, two, substituents, followed, by, ether, for, example, ethyl, methyl, ether, ch, 3, oc, 2, h, 5, diphenylether, c, 6, h, 5, oc, 6, h, 5, as, for, other, organic, compounds, very, common, ethers, acquired, names, before, rules, for, nomenclature, were, formalized, diethyl, ether, is, simply, called, ether, but, was, once, called, sweet, oil, of, vitriol, methyl, phenyl, ether, is, anisole, because, it, was, originally, found, in, aniseed, the, aromatic, ethers, include, furans, acetals, alkoxy, ethers, r, ch, or, o, r, are, another, class, of, ethers, with, characteristic, properties, polyethers, are, generally, polymers, containing, ether, linkages, in, their, main, chain, the, term, polyol, generally, refers, to, polyether, polyols, with, one, or, more, functional, end, groups, such, as, a, hydroxyl, group, the, term, oxide, or, other, terms, are, used, for, high, molar, mass, polymer, when, end, groups, no, longer, affect, polymer, properties, crown, ethers, are, cyclic, polyethers, some, toxins, produced, by, dinoflagellates, such, as, brevetoxin, and, ciguatoxin, are, extremely, large, and, are, known, as, cyclic, or, ladder, polyethers, the, phenyl, ether, polymers, are, a, class, of, aromatic, polyethers, containing, aromatic, cycles, in, their, main, chain, polyphenyl, ether, ppe, and, poly, p, phenylene, oxide, ppo, many, classes, of, compounds, with, c, o, c, linkages, are, not, considered, ethers, esters, r, c, o, o, r, hemiacetals, r, ch, oh, o, r, carboxylic, acid, anhydrides, rc, o, o, c, o, r, there, are, compounds, which, instead, of, c, in, the, c, o, c, linkage, contain, heavier, group, 14, chemical, elements, e, g, si, ge, sn, pb, such, compounds, are, considered, ethers, as, well, examples, of, such, ethers, are, silyl, enol, ethers, r, 3, si, o, cr, cr, 2, containing, the, si, o, c, linkage, disiloxane, h, 3, si, o, sih, 3, the, other, name, of, this, compound, is, disilyl, ether, containing, the, si, o, si, linkage, and, stannoxanes, r, 3, sn, o, snr, 3, containing, the, sn, o, sn, linkage, ethers, have, boiling, points, similar, to, those, of, the, analogous, alkanes, simple, ethers, are, generally, colorless, the, c, o, bonds, that, comprise, simple, ethers, are, strong, they, are, unreactive, toward, all, but, the, strongest, bases, although, generally, of, low, chemical, reactivity, they, are, more, reactive, than, alkanes, specialized, ethers, such, as, epoxides, ketals, and, acetals, are, unrepresentative, classes, of, ethers, and, are, discussed, in, separate, articles, important, reactions, are, listed, below, although, ethers, resist, hydrolysis, they, are, cleaved, by, hydrobromic, acid, and, hydroiodic, acid, hydrogen, chloride, cleaves, ethers, only, slowly, methyl, ethers, typically, afford, methyl, halides, these, reactions, proceed, via, onium, intermediates, i, e, br, some, ethers, undergo, rapid, cleavage, with, boron, tribromide, even, aluminium, chloride, is, used, in, some, cases, to, give, the, alkyl, bromide, depending, on, the, substituents, some, ethers, can, be, cleaved, with, a, variety, of, reagents, e, g, strong, base, despite, these, difficulties, the, chemical, paper, pulping, processes, are, based, on, cleavage, of, ether, bonds, in, the, lignin, when, stored, in, the, presence, of, air, or, oxygen, ethers, tend, to, form, explosive, peroxides, such, as, diethyl, ether, hydroperoxide, the, reaction, is, accelerated, by, light, metal, catalysts, and, aldehydes, in, addition, to, avoiding, storage, conditions, likely, to, form, peroxides, it, is, recommended, when, an, ether, is, used, as, a, solvent, not, to, distill, it, to, dryness, as, any, peroxides, that, may, have, formed, being, less, volatile, than, the, original, ether, will, become, concentrated, in, the, last, few, drops, of, liquid, the, presence, of, peroxide, in, old, samples, of, ethers, may, be, detected, by, shaking, them, with, freshly, prepared, solution, of, a, ferrous, sulfate, followed, by, addition, of, kscn, appearance, of, blood, red, color, indicates, presence, of, peroxides, the, dangerous, properties, of, ether, peroxides, are, the, reason, that, diethyl, ether, and, other, peroxide, forming, ethers, like, tetrahydrofuran, thf, or, ethylene, glycol, dimethyl, ether, 1, 2, dimethoxyethane, are, avoided, in, industrial, processes, ethers, serve, as, lewis, bases, for, instance, diethyl, ether, forms, a, complex, with, boron, trifluoride, i, e, borane, diethyl, etherate, bf, 3, o, ch, 2, ch, 3, 2, ethers, also, coordinate, to, the, mg, center, in, grignard, reagents, tetrahydrofuran, is, more, basic, than, acyclic, ethers, it, forms, with, many, complexes, this, reactivity, is, similar, to, the, tendency, of, ethers, with, alpha, hydrogen, atoms, to, form, peroxides, reaction, with, chlorine, produces, alpha, chloroethers, the, dehydration, of, alcohols, affords, ethers, this, direct, nucleophilic, substitution, reaction, requires, elevated, temperatures, about, 125, c, the, reaction, is, catalyzed, by, acids, usually, sulfuric, acid, the, method, is, effective, for, generating, symmetrical, ethers, but, not, unsymmetrical, ethers, since, either, oh, can, be, protonated, which, would, give, a, mixture, of, products, diethyl, ether, is, produced, from, ethanol, by, this, method, cyclic, ethers, are, readily, generated, by, this, approach, elimination, reactions, compete, with, dehydration, of, the, alcohol, the, dehydration, route, often, requires, conditions, incompatible, with, delicate, molecules, several, milder, methods, exist, to, produce, ethers, alcohols, add, to, electrophilically, activated, alkenes, the, method, is, atom, economical, acid, catalysis, is, required, for, this, reaction, commericially, important, ethers, prepared, in, this, way, are, derived, from, isobutene, or, isoamylene, which, protonate, to, give, relatively, stable, carbocations, using, ethanol, and, methanol, with, these, two, alkenes, four, fuel, grade, ethers, are, produced, methyl, tert, butyl, ether, mtbe, methyl, tert, amyl, ether, tame, ethyl, tert, butyl, ether, etbe, and, ethyl, tert, amyl, ether, taee, solid, acid, catalysts, are, typically, used, to, promote, this, reaction, epoxides, are, typically, prepared, by, oxidation, of, alkenes, the, most, important, epoxide, in, terms, of, industrial, scale, is, ethylene, oxide, which, is, produced, by, oxidation, of, ethylene, with, oxygen, other, epoxides, are, produced, by, one, of, two, routes, many, ethers, ethoxylates, and, crown, ethers, are, produced, from, epoxides, nucleophilic, displacement, of, alkyl, halides, by, alkoxides, this, reaction, the, williamson, ether, synthesis, involves, treatment, of, a, parent, alcohol, with, a, strong, base, to, form, the, alkoxide, followed, by, addition, of, an, appropriate, aliphatic, compound, bearing, a, suitable, leaving, group, r, x, although, popular, in, textbooks, the, method, is, usually, impractical, on, scale, because, it, cogenerates, significant, waste, suitable, leaving, groups, x, include, iodide, bromide, or, sulfonates, this, method, usually, does, not, work, well, for, aryl, halides, e, g, bromobenzene, see, ullmann, condensation, below, likewise, this, method, only, gives, the, best, yields, for, primary, halides, secondary, and, tertiary, halides, are, prone, to, undergo, e2, elimination, on, exposure, to, the, basic, alkoxide, anion, used, in, the, reaction, due, to, steric, hindrance, from, the, large, alkyl, groups, in, a, related, reaction, alkyl, halides, undergo, nucleophilic, displacement, by, phenoxides, the, r, x, cannot, be, used, to, react, with, the, alcohol, however, phenols, can, be, used, to, replace, the, alcohol, while, maintaining, the, alkyl, halide, since, phenols, are, acidic, they, readily, react, with, a, strong, base, like, sodium, hydroxide, to, form, phenoxide, ions, the, phenoxide, ion, will, then, substitute, the, x, group, in, the, alkyl, halide, forming, an, ether, with, an, aryl, group, attached, to, it, in, a, reaction, with, an, s, n, 2, mechanism, the, ullmann, condensation, is, similar, to, the, williamson, method, except, that, the, substrate, is, an, aryl, halide, such, reactions, generally, require, a, catalyst, such, as, copper
