legend, the, noble, gases, historically, the, inert, gases, sometimes, referred, to, as, aerogens, are, the, naturally, occurring, members, of, group, 18, of, the, periodic, table, helium, he, neon, ne, argon, ar, krypton, kr, xenon, xe, and, radon, rn, under, standard, conditions, these, elements, are, odorless, colorless, monatomic, gases, with, very, low, chemical, reactivity, and, cryogenic, boiling, points, the, noble, gases, inertness, or, tendency, not, to, react, with, other, chemical, substances, results, from, their, electron, configuration, their, outer, shell, of, valence, electrons, is, full, giving, them, little, tendency, to, participate, in, chemical, reactions, only, a, few, hundred, noble, gas, compounds, are, known, to, exist, for, the, same, reason, noble, gas, atoms, are, small, and, the, only, intermolecular, force, between, them, is, the, very, weak, london, dispersion, force, so, their, boiling, points, are, all, cryogenic, below, 165, k, 108, c, 163, f, the, inertness, of, noble, gases, makes, them, useful, whenever, chemical, reactions, are, unwanted, for, example, argon, is, used, as, a, shielding, gas, in, welding, and, as, a, filler, gas, in, incandescent, light, bulbs, after, the, risks, caused, by, the, flammability, of, hydrogen, became, apparent, in, the, hindenburg, disaster, hydrogen, was, replaced, with, helium, in, blimps, and, balloons, helium, and, neon, are, also, used, as, refrigerants, due, to, their, low, boiling, points, industrial, quantities, of, the, noble, gases, except, for, radon, are, obtained, by, separating, them, from, air, using, the, methods, of, liquefaction, of, gases, and, fractional, distillation, helium, is, also, a, byproduct, of, the, mining, of, natural, gas, radon, is, usually, isolated, from, the, radioactive, decay, of, dissolved, radium, thorium, or, uranium, compounds, the, seventh, member, of, group, 18, is, oganesson, og, an, unstable, synthetic, element, whose, chemistry, is, still, uncertain, because, only, five, very, short, lived, atoms, t, 1, 2, 0, 69, ms, have, ever, been, synthesized, as, of, 2020, iupac, uses, the, term, noble, gas, interchangeably, with, group, 18, and, thus, includes, oganesson, however, due, to, relativistic, effects, oganesson, is, predicted, to, be, a, solid, under, standard, conditions, and, reactive, enough, not, to, qualify, functionally, as, noble, in, the, rest, of, this, article, the, term, noble, gas, should, be, understood, not, to, include, oganesson, unless, it, is, specifically, mentioned, noble, gas, is, translated, from, the, german, noun, edelgas, first, used, in, 1900, by, hugo, erdmann, to, indicate, their, extremely, low, level, of, reactivity, the, name, makes, an, analogy, to, the, term, noble, metals, which, also, have, low, reactivity, the, noble, gases, have, also, been, referred, to, as, inert, gases, but, this, label, is, deprecated, as, many, noble, gas, compounds, are, now, known, rare, gases, is, another, term, that, was, used, but, this, is, also, inaccurate, because, argon, forms, a, fairly, considerable, part, 0, 94, by, volume, 1, 3, by, mass, of, the, earth, s, atmosphere, due, to, decay, of, radioactive, potassium, 40, pierre, janssen, and, joseph, norman, lockyer, had, discovered, a, new, element, on, 18, august, 1868, while, looking, at, the, chromosphere, of, the, sun, and, named, it, helium, after, the, greek, word, for, the, sun, h, lios, no, chemical, analysis, was, possible, at, the, time, but, helium, was, later, found, to, be, a, noble, gas, before, them, in, 1784, the, english, chemist, and, physicist, henry, cavendish, had, discovered, that, air, contains, a, small, proportion, of, a, substance, less, reactive, than, nitrogen, a, century, later, in, 1895, lord, rayleigh, discovered, that, samples, of, nitrogen, from, the, air, were, of, a, different, density, than, nitrogen, resulting, from, chemical, reactions, along, with, scottish, scientist, william, ramsay, at, university, college, london, lord, rayleigh, theorized, that, the, nitrogen, extracted, from, air, was, mixed, with, another, gas, leading, to, an, experiment, that, successfully, isolated, a, new, element, argon, from, the, greek, word, arg, s, idle, or, lazy, with, this, discovery, they, realized, an, entire, class, of, gases, was, missing, from, the, periodic, table, during, his, search, for, argon, ramsay, also, managed, to, isolate, helium, for, the, first, time, while, heating, cleveite, a, mineral, in, 1902, having, accepted, the, evidence, for, the, elements, helium, and, argon, dmitri, mendeleev, included, these, noble, gases, as, group, 0, in, his, arrangement, of, the, elements, which, would, later, become, the, periodic, table, ramsay, continued, his, search, for, these, gases, using, the, method, of, fractional, distillation, to, separate, liquid, air, into, several, components, in, 1898, he, discovered, the, elements, krypton, neon, and, xenon, and, named, them, after, the, greek, words, krypt, s, hidden, n, os, new, and, ks, nos, stranger, respectively, radon, was, first, identified, in, 1898, by, friedrich, ernst, dorn, and, was, named, radium, emanation, but, was, not, considered, a, noble, gas, until, 1904, when, its, characteristics, were, found, to, be, similar, to, those, of, other, noble, gases, rayleigh, and, ramsay, received, the, 1904, nobel, prizes, in, physics, and, in, chemistry, respectively, for, their, discovery, of, the, noble, gases, in, the, words, of, j, e, cederblom, then, president, of, the, royal, swedish, academy, of, sciences, the, discovery, of, an, entirely, new, group, of, elements, of, which, no, single, representative, had, been, known, with, any, certainty, is, something, utterly, unique, in, the, history, of, chemistry, being, intrinsically, an, advance, in, science, of, peculiar, significance, the, discovery, of, the, noble, gases, aided, in, the, development, of, a, general, understanding, of, atomic, structure, in, 1895, french, chemist, henri, moissan, attempted, to, form, a, reaction, between, fluorine, the, most, electronegative, element, and, argon, one, of, the, noble, gases, but, failed, scientists, were, unable, to, prepare, compounds, of, argon, until, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, but, these, attempts, helped, to, develop, new, theories, of, atomic, structure, learning, from, these, experiments, danish, physicist, niels, bohr, proposed, in, 1913, that, the, electrons, in, atoms, are, arranged, in, shells, surrounding, the, nucleus, and, that, for, all, noble, gases, except, helium, the, outermost, shell, always, contains, eight, electrons, in, 1916, gilbert, n, lewis, formulated, the, octet, rule, which, concluded, an, octet, of, electrons, in, the, outer, shell, was, the, most, stable, arrangement, for, any, atom, this, arrangement, caused, them, to, be, unreactive, with, other, elements, since, they, did, not, require, any, more, electrons, to, complete, their, outer, shell, in, 1962, neil, bartlett, discovered, the, first, chemical, compound, of, a, noble, gas, xenon, hexafluoroplatinate, compounds, of, other, noble, gases, were, discovered, soon, after, in, 1962, for, radon, radon, difluoride, rnf, 2, which, was, identified, by, radiotracer, techniques, and, in, 1963, for, krypton, krypton, difluoride, krf, 2, the, first, stable, compound, of, argon, was, reported, in, 2000, when, argon, fluorohydride, harf, was, formed, at, a, temperature, of, 40, k, 233, 2, c, 387, 7, f, in, october, 2006, scientists, from, the, joint, institute, for, nuclear, research, and, lawrence, livermore, national, laboratory, successfully, created, synthetically, oganesson, the, seventh, element, in, group, 18, by, bombarding, californium, with, calcium, the, noble, gases, have, weak, interatomic, force, and, consequently, have, very, low, melting, and, boiling, points, they, are, all, monatomic, gases, under, standard, conditions, including, the, elements, with, larger, atomic, masses, than, many, normally, solid, elements, helium, has, several, unique, qualities, when, compared, with, other, elements, its, boiling, point, at, 1, atm, is, lower, than, those, of, any, other, known, substance, it, is, the, only, element, known, to, exhibit, superfluidity, and, it, is, the, only, element, that, cannot, be, solidified, by, cooling, at, atmospheric, pressure, an, effect, explained, by, quantum, mechanics, as, its, zero, point, energy, is, too, high, to, permit, freezing, a, pressure, of, 25, standard, atmospheres, 2, 500, kpa, 370, psi, must, be, applied, at, a, temperature, of, 0, 95, k, 272, 200, c, 457, 960, f, to, convert, it, to, a, solid, while, a, pressure, of, about, 113, 500, atm, 11, 500, 000, kpa, 1, 668, 000, psi, is, required, at, room, temperature, the, noble, gases, up, to, xenon, have, multiple, stable, isotopes, krypton, and, xenon, also, have, naturally, occurring, radioisotopes, namely, 78, kr, 124, xe, and, 136, xe, all, have, very, long, lives, 10, 21, years, and, can, undergo, double, electron, capture, or, double, beta, decay, radon, has, no, stable, isotopes, its, longest, lived, isotope, 222, rn, has, a, half, life, of, 3, 8, days, and, decays, to, form, helium, and, polonium, which, ultimately, decays, to, lead, oganesson, also, has, no, stable, isotopes, and, its, only, known, isotope, 294, og, is, very, short, lived, half, life, 0, 7, ms, melting, and, boiling, points, increase, going, down, the, group, the, noble, gas, atoms, like, atoms, in, most, groups, increase, steadily, in, atomic, radius, from, one, period, to, the, next, due, to, the, increasing, number, of, electrons, the, size, of, the, atom, is, related, to, several, properties, for, example, the, ionization, potential, decreases, with, an, increasing, radius, because, the, valence, electrons, in, the, larger, noble, gases, are, farther, away, from, the, nucleus, and, are, therefore, not, held, as, tightly, together, by, the, atom, noble, gases, have, the, largest, ionization, potential, among, the, elements, of, each, period, which, reflects, the, stability, of, their, electron, configuration, and, is, related, to, their, relative, lack, of, chemical, reactivity, some, of, the, heavier, noble, gases, however, have, ionization, potentials, small, enough, to, be, comparable, to, those, of, other, elements, and, molecules, it, was, the, insight, that, xenon, has, an, ionization, potential, similar, to, that, of, the, oxygen, molecule, that, led, bartlett, to, attempt, oxidizing, xenon, using, platinum, hexafluoride, an, oxidizing, agent, known, to, be, strong, enough, to, react, with, oxygen, noble, gases, cannot, accept, an, electron, to, form, stable, anions, that, is, they, have, a, negative, electron, affinity, the, macroscopic, physical, properties, of, the, noble, gases, are, dominated, by, the, weak, van, der, waals, forces, between, the, atoms, the, attractive, force, increases, with, the, size, of, the, atom, as, a, result, of, the, increase, in, polarizability, and, the, decrease, in, ionization, potential, this, results, in, systematic, group, trends, as, one, goes, down, group, 18, the, atomic, radius, increases, and, with, it, the, interatomic, forces, increase, resulting, in, an, increasing, melting, point, boiling, point, enthalpy, of, vaporization, and, solubility, the, increase, in, density, is, due, to, the, increase, in, atomic, mass, the, noble, gases, are, nearly, ideal, gases, under, standard, conditions, but, their, deviations, from, the, ideal, gas, law, provided, important, clues, for, the, study, of, intermolecular, interactions, the, lennard, jones, potential, often, used, to, model, intermolecular, interactions, was, deduced, in, 1924, by, john, lennard, jones, from, experimental, data, on, argon, before, the, development, of, quantum, mechanics, provided, the, tools, for, understanding, intermolecular, forces, from, first, principles, the, theoretical, analysis, of, these, interactions, became, tractable, because, the, noble, gases, are, monatomic, and, the, atoms, spherical, which, means, that, the, interaction, between, the, atoms, is, independent, of, direction, or, isotropic, the, noble, gases, are, colorless, odorless, tasteless, and, nonflammable, under, standard, conditions, they, were, once, labeled, group, 0, in, the, periodic, table, because, it, was, believed, they, had, a, valence, of, zero, meaning, their, atoms, cannot, combine, with, those, of, other, elements, to, form, compounds, however, it, was, later, discovered, some, do, indeed, form, compounds, causing, this, label, to, fall, into, disuse, like, other, groups, the, members, of, this, family, show, patterns, in, its, electron, configuration, especially, the, outermost, shells, resulting, in, trends, in, chemical, behavior, the, noble, gases, have, full, valence, electron, shells, valence, electrons, are, the, outermost, electrons, of, an, atom, and, are, normally, the, only, electrons, that, participate, in, chemical, bonding, atoms, with, full, valence, electron, shells, are, extremely, stable, and, therefore, do, not, tend, to, form, chemical, bonds, and, have, little, tendency, to, gain, or, lose, electrons, however, heavier, noble, gases, such, as, radon, are, held, less, firmly, together, by, electromagnetic, force, than, lighter, noble, gases, such, as, helium, making, it, easier, to, remove, outer, electrons, from, heavy, noble, gases, as, a, result, of, a, full, shell, the, noble, gases, can, be, used, in, conjunction, with, the, electron, configuration, notation, to, form, the, noble, gas, notation, to, do, this, the, nearest, noble, gas, that, precedes, the, element, in, question, is, written, first, and, then, the, electron, configuration, is, continued, from, that, point, forward, for, example, the, electron, notation, of, phosphorus, is, 1s, 2, 2s, 2, 2p, 6, 3s, 2, 3p, 3, while, the, noble, gas, notation, is, 3s, 2, 3p, 3, this, more, compact, notation, makes, it, easier, to, identify, elements, and, is, shorter, than, writing, out, the, full, notation, of, atomic, orbitals, the, noble, gases, cross, the, boundary, between, blocks, helium, is, an, s, element, whereas, the, rest, of, members, are, p, elements, which, is, unusual, among, the, iupac, groups, all, other, iupac, groups, contain, elements, from, one, block, each, this, causes, some, inconsistencies, in, trends, across, the, table, and, on, those, grounds, some, chemists, have, proposed, that, helium, should, be, moved, to, group, 2, to, be, with, other, s, 2, elements, but, this, change, has, not, generally, been, adopted, the, noble, gases, show, extremely, low, chemical, reactivity, consequently, only, a, few, hundred, noble, gas, compounds, have, been, formed, neutral, compounds, in, which, helium, and, neon, are, involved, in, chemical, bonds, have, not, been, formed, although, some, helium, containing, ions, exist, and, there, is, some, theoretical, evidence, for, a, few, neutral, helium, containing, ones, while, xenon, krypton, and, argon, have, shown, only, minor, reactivity, the, reactivity, follows, the, order, ne, he, ar, kr, xe, rn, og, in, 1933, linus, pauling, predicted, that, the, heavier, noble, gases, could, form, compounds, with, fluorine, and, oxygen, he, predicted, the, existence, of, krypton, hexafluoride, krf, 6, and, xenon, hexafluoride, xef, 6, and, speculated, that, xenon, octafluoride, xef, 8, might, exist, as, an, unstable, compound, and, suggested, that, xenic, acid, could, form, perxenate, salts, these, predictions, were, shown, to, be, generally, accurate, except, that, xef, 8, is, now, thought, to, be, both, thermodynamically, and, kinetically, unstable, xenon, compounds, are, the, most, numerous, of, the, noble, gas, compounds, that, have, been, formed, most, of, them, have, the, xenon, atom, in, the, oxidation, state, of, 2, 4, 6, or, 8, bonded, to, highly, electronegative, atoms, such, as, fluorine, or, oxygen, as, in, xenon, difluoride, xef, 2, xenon, tetrafluoride, xef, 4, xenon, hexafluoride, xef, 6, xenon, tetroxide, xeo, 4, and, sodium, perxenate, na, 4, xeo, 6, xenon, reacts, with, fluorine, to, form, numerous, xenon, fluorides, according, to, the, following, equations, some, of, these, compounds, have, found, use, in, chemical, synthesis, as, oxidizing, agents, xef, 2, in, particular, is, commercially, available, and, can, be, used, as, a, fluorinating, agent, as, of, 2007, about, five, hundred, compounds, of, xenon, bonded, to, other, elements, have, been, identified, including, organoxenon, compounds, containing, xenon, bonded, to, carbon, and, xenon, bonded, to, nitrogen, chlorine, gold, mercury, and, xenon, itself, compounds, of, xenon, bound, to, boron, hydrogen, bromine, iodine, beryllium, sulphur, titanium, copper, and, silver, have, also, been, observed, but, only, at, low, temperatures, in, noble, gas, matrices, or, in, supersonic, noble, gas, jets, radon, is, more, reactive, than, xenon, and, forms, chemical, bonds, more, easily, than, xenon, does, however, due, to, the, high, radioactivity, and, short, half, life, of, radon, isotopes, only, a, few, fluorides, and, oxides, of, radon, have, been, formed, in, practice, radon, goes, further, towards, metallic, behavior, than, xenon, the, difluoride, rnf, 2, is, highly, ionic, and, cationic, rn, 2, is, formed, in, halogen, fluoride, solutions, for, this, reason, kinetic, hindrance, makes, it, difficult, to, oxidize, radon, beyond, the, 2, state, only, tracer, experiments, appear, to, have, succeeded, in, doing, so, probably, forming, rnf, 4, rnf, 6, and, rno, 3, krypton, is, less, reactive, than, xenon, but, several, compounds, have, been, reported, with, krypton, in, the, oxidation, state, of, 2, krypton, difluoride, is, the, most, notable, and, easily, characterized, under, extreme, conditions, krypton, reacts, with, fluorine, to, form, krf, 2, according, to, the, following, equation, compounds, in, which, krypton, forms, a, single, bond, to, nitrogen, and, oxygen, have, also, been, characterized, but, are, only, stable, below, 60, c, 76, f, and, 90, c, 130, f, respectively, krypton, atoms, chemically, bound, to, other, nonmetals, hydrogen, chlorine, carbon, as, well, as, some, late, transition, metals, copper, silver, gold, have, also, been, observed, but, only, either, at, low, temperatures, in, noble, gas, matrices, or, in, supersonic, noble, gas, jets, similar, conditions, were, used, to, obtain, the, first, few, compounds, of, argon, in, 2000, such, as, argon, fluorohydride, harf, and, some, bound, to, the, late, transition, metals, copper, silver, and, gold, as, of, 2007, no, stable, neutral, molecules, involving, covalently, bound, helium, or, neon, are, known, extrapolation, from, periodic, trends, predict, that, oganesson, should, be, the, most, reactive, of, the, noble, gases, more, sophisticated, theoretical, treatments, indicate, greater, reactivity, than, such, extrapolations, suggest, to, the, point, where, the, applicability, of, the, descriptor, noble, gas, has, been, questioned, oganesson, is, expected, to, be, rather, like, silicon, or, tin, in, group, 14, a, reactive, element, with, a, common, 4, and, a, less, common, 2, state, which, at, room, temperature, and, pressure, is, not, a, gas, but, rather, a, solid, semiconductor, empirical, experimental, testing, will, be, required, to, validate, these, predictions, on, the, other, hand, flerovium, despite, being, in, group, 14, is, predicted, to, be, unusually, volatile, which, suggests, noble, gas, like, properties, the, noble, gases, including, helium, can, form, stable, molecular, ions, in, the, gas, phase, the, simplest, is, the, helium, hydride, molecular, ion, heh, discovered, in, 1925, because, it, is, composed, of, the, two, most, abundant, elements, in, the, universe, hydrogen, and, helium, it, was, believed, to, occur, naturally, in, the, interstellar, medium, and, it, was, finally, detected, in, april, 2019, using, the, airborne, sofia, telescope, in, addition, to, these, ions, there, are, many, known, neutral, excimers, of, the, noble, gases, these, are, compounds, such, as, arf, and, krf, that, are, stable, only, when, in, an, excited, electronic, state, some, of, them, find, application, in, excimer, lasers, in, addition, to, the, compounds, where, a, noble, gas, atom, is, involved, in, a, covalent, bond, noble, gases, also, form, non, covalent, compounds, the, clathrates, first, described, in, 1949, consist, of, a, noble, gas, atom, trapped, within, cavities, of, crystal, lattices, of, certain, organic, and, inorganic, substances, the, essential, condition, for, their, formation, is, that, the, guest, noble, gas, atoms, must, be, of, appropriate, size, to, fit, in, the, cavities, of, the, host, crystal, lattice, for, instance, argon, krypton, and, xenon, form, clathrates, with, hydroquinone, but, helium, and, neon, do, not, because, they, are, too, small, or, insufficiently, polarizable, to, be, retained, neon, argon, krypton, and, xenon, also, form, clathrate, hydrates, where, the, noble, gas, is, trapped, in, ice, noble, gases, can, form, endohedral, fullerene, compounds, in, which, the, noble, gas, atom, is, trapped, inside, a, fullerene, molecule, in, 1993, it, was, discovered, that, when, c, 60, a, spherical, molecule, consisting, of, 60, carbon, atoms, is, exposed, to, noble, gases, at, high, pressure, complexes, such, as, he, c, 60, can, be, formed, the, notation, indicates, he, is, contained, inside, c, 60, but, not, covalently, bound, to, it, as, of, 2008, endohedral, complexes, with, helium, neon, argon, krypton, and, xenon, have, been, created, these, compounds, have, found, use, in, the, study, of, the, structure, and, reactivity, of, fullerenes, by, means, of, the, nuclear, magnetic, resonance, of, the, noble, gas, atom, noble, gas, compounds, such, as, xenon, difluoride, xef, 2, are, considered, to, be, hypervalent, because, they, violate, the, octet, rule, bonding, in, such, compounds, can, be, explained, using, a, three, center, four, electron, bond, model, this, model, first, proposed, in, 1951, considers, bonding, of, three, collinear, atoms, for, example, bonding, in, xef, 2, is, described, by, a, set, of, three, molecular, orbitals, mos, derived, from, p, orbitals, on, each, atom, bonding, results, from, the, combination, of, a, filled, p, orbital, from, xe, with, one, half, filled, p, orbital, from, each, f, atom, resulting, in, a, filled, bonding, orbital, a, filled, non, bonding, orbital, and, an, empty, antibonding, orbital, the, highest, occupied, molecular, orbital, is, localized, on, the, two, terminal, atoms, this, represents, a, localization, of, charge, that, is, facilitated, by, the, high, electronegativity, of, fluorine, the, chemistry, of, the, heavier, noble, gases, krypton, and, xenon, are, well, established, the, chemistry, of, the, lighter, ones, argon, and, helium, is, still, at, an, early, stage, while, a, neon, compound, is, yet, to, be, identified, the, abundances, of, the, noble, gases, in, the, universe, decrease, as, their, atomic, numbers, increase, helium, is, the, most, common, element, in, the, universe, after, hydrogen, with, a, mass, fraction, of, about, 24, most, of, the, helium, in, the, universe, was, formed, during, big, bang, nucleosynthesis, but, the, amount, of, helium, is, steadily, increasing, due, to, the, fusion, of, hydrogen, in, stellar, nucleosynthesis, and, to, a, very, slight, degree, the, alpha, decay, of, heavy, elements, abundances, on, earth, follow, different, trends, for, example, helium, is, only, the, third, most, abundant, noble, gas, in, the, atmosphere, the, reason, is, that, there, is, no, primordial, helium, in, the, atmosphere, due, to, the, small, mass, of, the, atom, helium, cannot, be, retained, by, the, earth, s, gravitational, field, helium, on, earth, comes, from, the, alpha, decay, of, heavy, elements, such, as, uranium, and, thorium, found, in, the, earth, s, crust, and, tends, to, accumulate, in, natural, gas, deposits, the, abundance, of, argon, on, the, other, hand, is, increased, as, a, result, of, the, beta, decay, of, potassium, 40, also, found, in, the, earth, s, crust, to, form, argon, 40, which, is, the, most, abundant, isotope, of, argon, on, earth, despite, being, relatively, rare, in, the, solar, system, this, process, is, the, basis, for, the, potassium, argon, dating, method, xenon, has, an, unexpectedly, low, abundance, in, the, atmosphere, in, what, has, been, called, the, missing, xenon, problem, one, theory, is, that, the, missing, xenon, may, be, trapped, in, minerals, inside, the, earth, s, crust, after, the, discovery, of, xenon, dioxide, research, showed, that, xe, can, substitute, for, si, in, quartz, radon, is, formed, in, the, lithosphere, by, the, alpha, decay, of, radium, it, can, seep, into, buildings, through, cracks, in, their, foundation, and, accumulate, in, areas, that, are, not, well, ventilated, due, to, its, high, radioactivity, radon, presents, a, significant, health, hazard, it, is, implicated, in, an, estimated, 21, 000, lung, cancer, deaths, per, year, in, the, united, states, alone, oganesson, does, not, occur, in, nature, and, is, instead, created, manually, by, scientists, for, large, scale, use, helium, is, extracted, by, fractional, distillation, from, natural, gas, which, can, contain, up, to, 7, helium, neon, argon, krypton, and, xenon, are, obtained, from, air, using, the, methods, of, liquefaction, of, gases, to, convert, elements, to, a, liquid, state, and, fractional, distillation, to, separate, mixtures, into, component, parts, helium, is, typically, produced, by, separating, it, from, natural, gas, and, radon, is, isolated, from, the, radioactive, decay, of, radium, compounds, the, prices, of, the, noble, gases, are, influenced, by, their, natural, abundance, with, argon, being, the, cheapest, and, xenon, the, most, expensive, as, an, example, the, adjacent, table, lists, the, 2004, prices, in, the, united, states, for, laboratory, quantities, of, each, gas, none, of, the, elements, in, this, group, has, any, biological, importance, noble, gases, have, very, low, boiling, and, melting, points, which, makes, them, useful, as, cryogenic, refrigerants, in, particular, liquid, helium, which, boils, at, 4, 2, k, 268, 95, c, 452, 11, f, is, used, for, superconducting, magnets, such, as, those, needed, in, nuclear, magnetic, resonance, imaging, and, nuclear, magnetic, resonance, liquid, neon, although, it, does, not, reach, temperatures, as, low, as, liquid, helium, also, finds, use, in, cryogenics, because, it, has, over, 40, times, more, refrigerating, capacity, than, liquid, helium, and, over, three, times, more, than, liquid, hydrogen, helium, is, used, as, a, component, of, breathing, gases, to, replace, nitrogen, due, its, low, solubility, in, fluids, especially, in, lipids, gases, are, absorbed, by, the, blood, and, body, tissues, when, under, pressure, like, in, scuba, diving, which, causes, an, anesthetic, effect, known, as, nitrogen, narcosis, due, to, its, reduced, solubility, little, helium, is, taken, into, cell, membranes, and, when, helium, is, used, to, replace, part, of, the, breathing, mixtures, such, as, in, trimix, or, heliox, a, decrease, in, the, narcotic, effect, of, the, gas, at, depth, is, obtained, helium, s, reduced, solubility, offers, further, advantages, for, the, condition, known, as, decompression, sickness, or, the, bends, the, reduced, amount, of, dissolved, gas, in, the, body, means, that, fewer, gas, bubbles, form, during, the, decrease, in, pressure, of, the, ascent, another, noble, gas, argon, is, considered, the, best, option, for, use, as, a, drysuit, inflation, gas, for, scuba, diving, helium, is, also, used, as, filling, gas, in, nuclear, fuel, rods, for, nuclear, reactors, since, the, hindenburg, disaster, in, 1937, helium, has, replaced, hydrogen, as, a, lifting, gas, in, blimps, and, balloons, despite, an, 8, 6, decrease, in, buoyancy, compared, to, hydrogen, helium, is, not, combustible, in, many, applications, the, noble, gases, are, used, to, provide, an, inert, atmosphere, argon, is, used, in, the, synthesis, of, air, sensitive, compounds, that, are, sensitive, to, nitrogen, solid, argon, is, also, used, for, the, study, of, very, unstable, compounds, such, as, reactive, intermediates, by, trapping, them, in, an, inert, matrix, at, very, low, temperatures, helium, is, used, as, the, carrier, medium, in, gas, chromatography, as, a, filler, gas, for, thermometers, and, in, devices, for, measuring, radiation, such, as, the, geiger, counter, and, the, bubble, chamber, helium, and, argon, are, both, commonly, used, to, shield, welding, arcs, and, the, surrounding, base, metal, from, the, atmosphere, during, welding, and, cutting, as, well, as, in, other, metallurgical, processes, and, in, the, production, of, silicon, for, the, semiconductor, industry, noble, gases, are, commonly, used, in, lighting, because, of, their, lack, of, chemical, reactivity, argon, mixed, with, nitrogen, is, used, as, a, filler, gas, for, incandescent, light, bulbs, krypton, is, used, in, high, performance, light, bulbs, which, have, higher, color, temperatures, and, greater, efficiency, because, it, reduces, the, rate, of, evaporation, of, the, filament, more, than, argon, halogen, lamps, in, particular, use, krypton, mixed, with, small, amounts, of, compounds, of, iodine, or, bromine, the, noble, gases, glow, in, distinctive, colors, when, used, inside, gas, discharge, lamps, such, as, neon, lights, these, lights, are, called, after, neon, but, often, contain, other, gases, and, phosphors, which, add, various, hues, to, the, orange, red, color, of, neon, xenon, is, commonly, used, in, xenon, arc, lamps, which, due, to, their, nearly, continuous, spectrum, that, resembles, daylight, find, application, in, film, projectors, and, as, automobile, headlamps, the, noble, gases, are, used, in, excimer, lasers, which, are, based, on, short, lived, electronically, excited, molecules, known, as, excimers, the, excimers, used, for, lasers, may, be, noble, gas, dimers, such, as, ar, 2, kr, 2, or, xe, 2, or, more, commonly, the, noble, gas, is, combined, with, a, halogen, in, excimers, such, as, arf, krf, xef, or, xecl, these, lasers, produce, ultraviolet, light, which, due, to, its, short, wavelength, 193, nm, for, arf, and, 248, nm, for, krf, allows, for, high, precision, imaging, excimer, lasers, have, many, industrial, medical, and, scientific, applications, they, are, used, for, microlithography, and, microfabrication, which, are, essential, for, integrated, circuit, manufacture, and, for, laser, surgery, including, laser, angioplasty, and, eye, surgery, some, noble, gases, have, direct, application, in, medicine, helium, is, sometimes, used, to, improve, the, ease, of, breathing, of, people, with, asthma, xenon, is, used, as, an, anesthetic, because, of, its, high, solubility, in, lipids, which, makes, it, more, potent, than, the, usual, nitrous, oxide, and, because, it, is, readily, eliminated, from, the, body, resulting, in, faster, recovery, xenon, finds, application, in, medical, imaging, of, the, lungs, through, hyperpolarized, mri, radon, which, is, highly, radioactive, and, is, only, available, in, minute, amounts, is, used, in, radiotherapy, noble, gases, particularly, xenon, are, predominantly, used, in, ion, engines, due, to, their, inertness, since, ion, engines, are, not, driven, by, chemical, reactions, chemically, inert, fuels, are, desired, to, prevent, unwanted, reaction, between, the, fuel, and, anything, else, on, the, engine, oganesson, is, too, unstable, to, work, with, and, has, no, known, application, other, than, research, the,
