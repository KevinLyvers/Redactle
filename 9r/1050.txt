the, neutron, is, a, subatomic, particle, symbol, n, or, n, 0, which, has, a, neutral, not, positive, or, negative, charge, and, a, mass, slightly, greater, than, that, of, a, proton, protons, and, neutrons, constitute, the, nuclei, of, atoms, since, protons, and, neutrons, behave, similarly, within, the, nucleus, they, are, both, referred, to, as, nucleons, nucleons, have, a, mass, of, approximately, one, atomic, mass, unit, or, dalton, symbol, da, their, properties, and, interactions, are, described, by, nuclear, physics, protons, and, neutrons, are, not, elementary, particles, each, is, composed, of, three, quarks, the, chemical, properties, of, an, atom, are, mostly, determined, by, the, configuration, of, electrons, that, orbit, the, atom, s, heavy, nucleus, the, electron, configuration, is, determined, by, the, charge, of, the, nucleus, which, is, determined, by, the, number, of, protons, or, atomic, number, the, number, of, neutrons, is, the, neutron, number, neutrons, do, not, affect, the, electron, configuration, atoms, of, a, chemical, element, that, differ, only, in, neutron, number, are, called, isotopes, for, example, carbon, with, atomic, number, 6, has, an, abundant, isotope, carbon, 12, with, 6, neutrons, and, a, rare, isotope, carbon, 13, with, 7, neutrons, some, elements, occur, in, nature, with, only, one, stable, isotope, such, as, fluorine, other, elements, occur, with, many, stable, isotopes, such, as, tin, with, ten, stable, isotopes, or, with, no, stable, isotope, such, as, technetium, the, properties, of, an, atomic, nucleus, depend, on, both, atomic, and, neutron, numbers, with, their, positive, charge, the, protons, within, the, nucleus, are, repelled, by, the, long, range, electromagnetic, force, but, the, much, stronger, but, short, range, nuclear, force, binds, the, nucleons, closely, together, neutrons, are, required, for, the, stability, of, nuclei, with, the, exception, of, the, single, proton, hydrogen, nucleus, neutrons, are, produced, copiously, in, nuclear, fission, and, fusion, they, are, a, primary, contributor, to, the, nucleosynthesis, of, chemical, elements, within, stars, through, fission, fusion, and, neutron, capture, processes, the, neutron, is, essential, to, the, production, of, nuclear, power, in, the, decade, after, the, neutron, was, discovered, by, james, chadwick, in, 1932, neutrons, were, used, to, induce, many, different, types, of, nuclear, transmutations, with, the, discovery, of, nuclear, fission, in, 1938, it, was, quickly, realized, that, if, a, fission, event, produced, neutrons, each, of, these, neutrons, might, cause, further, fission, events, in, a, cascade, known, as, a, nuclear, chain, reaction, these, events, and, findings, led, to, the, first, self, sustaining, nuclear, reactor, chicago, pile, 1, 1942, and, the, first, nuclear, weapon, trinity, 1945, dedicated, neutron, sources, like, neutron, generators, research, reactors, and, spallation, sources, produce, free, neutrons, for, use, in, irradiation, and, in, neutron, scattering, experiments, a, free, neutron, spontaneously, decays, to, a, proton, an, electron, and, an, antineutrino, with, a, mean, lifetime, of, about, 15, minutes, free, neutrons, do, not, directly, ionize, atoms, but, they, do, indirectly, cause, ionizing, radiation, so, they, can, be, a, biological, hazard, depending, on, dose, a, small, natural, neutron, background, flux, of, free, neutrons, exists, on, earth, caused, by, cosmic, ray, showers, and, by, the, natural, radioactivity, of, spontaneously, fissionable, elements, in, the, earth, s, crust, an, atomic, nucleus, is, formed, by, a, number, of, protons, z, the, atomic, number, and, a, number, of, neutrons, n, the, neutron, number, bound, together, by, the, nuclear, force, protons, and, neutrons, each, have, a, mass, of, approximately, one, dalton, the, atomic, number, determines, the, chemical, properties, of, the, atom, and, the, neutron, number, determines, the, isotope, or, nuclide, 4, the, terms, isotope, and, nuclide, are, often, used, synonymously, but, they, refer, to, chemical, and, nuclear, properties, respectively, 4, isotopes, are, nuclides, with, the, same, atomic, number, but, different, neutron, number, nuclides, with, the, same, neutron, number, but, different, atomic, number, are, called, isotones, the, atomic, mass, number, a, is, equal, to, the, sum, of, atomic, and, neutron, numbers, nuclides, with, the, same, atomic, mass, number, but, different, atomic, and, neutron, numbers, are, called, isobars, the, mass, of, a, nucleus, is, always, slightly, less, than, the, sum, of, its, proton, and, neutron, masses, the, difference, in, mass, represents, the, mass, equivalent, to, nuclear, binding, energy, the, energy, which, would, need, to, be, added, to, take, the, nucleus, apart, 822, the, nucleus, of, the, most, common, isotope, of, the, hydrogen, atom, with, the, chemical, symbol, 1, h, is, a, lone, proton, 20, the, nuclei, of, the, heavy, hydrogen, isotopes, deuterium, d, or, 2, h, and, tritium, t, or, 3, h, contain, one, proton, bound, to, one, and, two, neutrons, respectively, 20, all, other, types, of, atomic, nuclei, are, composed, of, two, or, more, protons, and, various, numbers, of, neutrons, the, most, common, nuclide, of, the, common, chemical, element, lead, 208, pb, has, 82, protons, and, 126, neutrons, for, example, the, table, of, nuclides, comprises, all, the, known, nuclides, even, though, it, is, not, a, chemical, element, the, neutron, is, included, in, this, table, protons, and, neutrons, behave, almost, identically, under, the, influence, of, the, nuclear, force, within, the, nucleus, they, are, therefore, both, referred, to, collectively, as, nucleons, the, concept, of, isospin, in, which, the, proton, and, neutron, are, viewed, as, two, quantum, states, of, the, same, particle, is, used, to, model, the, interactions, of, nucleons, by, the, nuclear, or, weak, forces, 141, because, of, the, strength, of, the, nuclear, force, at, short, distances, the, nuclear, energy, binding, nucleons, is, many, orders, of, magnitude, greater, than, the, electromagnetic, energy, binding, electrons, in, atoms, 4, in, nuclear, fission, the, absorption, of, a, neutron, by, some, heavy, nuclides, such, as, uranium, 235, can, cause, the, nuclide, to, become, unstable, and, break, into, lighter, nuclides, and, additional, neutrons, the, positively, charged, light, nuclides, or, fission, fragments, then, repel, releasing, electromagnetic, potential, energy, if, this, reaction, occurs, within, a, mass, of, fissile, material, the, additional, neutrons, cause, additional, fission, events, inducing, a, cascade, known, as, a, nuclear, chain, reaction, 12, 13, for, a, given, mass, of, fissile, material, such, nuclear, reactions, release, energy, that, is, approximately, ten, million, times, that, from, an, equivalent, mass, of, a, conventional, chemical, explosive, 13, ultimately, the, ability, of, the, nuclear, force, to, store, energy, arising, from, the, electromagnetic, repulsion, of, nuclear, components, is, the, basis, for, most, of, the, energy, that, makes, nuclear, reactors, or, bombs, possible, most, of, the, energy, released, from, fission, is, the, kinetic, energy, of, the, fission, fragments, 12, neutrons, and, protons, within, a, nucleus, behave, similarly, and, can, exchange, their, identities, by, similar, reactions, these, reactions, are, a, form, of, radioactive, decay, known, as, beta, decay, beta, decay, in, which, neutrons, decay, to, protons, or, vice, versa, is, governed, by, the, weak, force, and, it, requires, the, emission, or, absorption, of, electrons, and, neutrinos, or, their, antiparticles, the, neutron, and, proton, decay, reactions, are, where, p, e, and, e, denote, the, proton, electron, and, electron, anti, neutrino, decay, products, and, where, n, 0, e, and, e, denote, the, neutron, positron, and, electron, neutrino, decay, products, the, electron, and, positron, produced, in, these, reactions, are, historically, known, as, beta, particles, denoted, or, respectively, lending, the, name, to, the, decay, process, in, these, reactions, the, original, particle, is, not, composed, of, the, product, particles, rather, the, product, particles, are, created, at, the, instant, of, the, reaction, 369, 370, free, neutrons, or, protons, are, nucleons, that, exist, independently, free, of, any, nucleus, the, free, neutron, has, a, mass, of, 939, 565, 413, 3, ev, c, 2, or, 939, 565, 4133, mev, c, 2, this, mass, is, equal, to, 1, 674, 927, 471, 10, 27, kg, or, 1, 008, 664, 915, 88, da, the, neutron, has, a, mean, square, radius, of, about, 0, 8, 10, 15, m, or, 0, 8, fm, and, it, is, a, spin, fermion, the, neutron, has, no, measurable, electric, charge, with, its, positive, electric, charge, the, proton, is, directly, influenced, by, electric, fields, whereas, the, neutron, is, unaffected, by, electric, fields, the, neutron, has, a, magnetic, moment, however, so, it, is, influenced, by, magnetic, fields, the, specific, properties, of, the, neutron, are, described, below, in, the, intrinsic, properties, section, outside, the, nucleus, free, neutrons, undergo, beta, decay, with, a, mean, lifetime, of, about, 14, minutes, 38, seconds, corresponding, to, a, half, life, of, about, 10, minutes, 11, s, the, mass, of, the, neutron, is, greater, than, that, of, the, proton, by, 1, 293, 32, mev, c, 2, hence, the, neutron, s, mass, provides, energy, sufficient, for, the, creation, of, the, proton, electron, and, anti, neutrino, in, the, decay, process, the, proton, electron, and, electron, anti, neutrino, conserve, the, energy, charge, and, lepton, number, of, the, neutron, the, electron, can, acquire, a, kinetic, energy, up, to, 0, 782, 0, 013, mev, still, unexplained, different, experimental, methods, for, measuring, the, neutron, s, lifetime, the, bottle, and, beam, methods, produce, different, values, for, it, the, bottle, method, employs, cold, neutrons, trapped, in, a, bottle, while, the, beam, method, employs, energetic, neutrons, in, a, particle, beam, the, measurements, by, the, two, methods, have, not, been, converging, with, time, the, lifetime, from, the, bottle, method, is, presently, 877, 75, s, which, is, 10, seconds, below, the, value, from, the, beam, method, of, 887, 7, s, a, small, fraction, about, one, per, thousand, of, free, neutrons, decay, with, the, same, products, but, add, an, extra, particle, in, the, form, of, an, emitted, gamma, ray, called, a, radiative, decay, mode, of, the, neutron, the, gamma, ray, may, be, thought, of, as, resulting, from, an, internal, bremsstrahlung, that, arises, from, the, electromagnetic, interaction, of, the, emitted, beta, particle, with, the, proton, a, smaller, fraction, about, four, per, million, of, free, neutrons, decay, in, so, called, two, body, neutron, decays, in, which, a, proton, electron, and, antineutrino, are, produced, as, usual, but, the, electron, fails, to, gain, the, 13, 6, ev, necessary, energy, to, escape, the, proton, the, ionization, energy, of, hydrogen, and, therefore, simply, remains, bound, to, it, forming, a, neutral, hydrogen, atom, one, of, the, two, bodies, in, this, type, of, free, neutron, decay, almost, all, of, the, neutron, decay, energy, is, carried, off, by, the, antineutrino, the, other, body, the, hydrogen, atom, recoils, with, a, speed, of, only, about, decay, energy, hydrogen, rest, energy, times, the, speed, of, light, or, 250, km, s, neutrons, are, a, necessary, constituent, of, any, atomic, nucleus, that, contains, more, than, one, proton, as, a, result, of, their, positive, charges, interacting, protons, have, a, mutual, electromagnetic, repulsion, that, is, stronger, than, their, attractive, nuclear, interaction, so, proton, only, nuclei, are, unstable, see, diproton, and, neutron, proton, ratio, neutrons, bind, with, protons, and, one, another, in, the, nucleus, via, the, nuclear, force, effectively, moderating, the, repulsive, forces, between, the, protons, and, stabilizing, the, nucleus, 461, heavy, nuclei, carry, a, large, positive, charge, hence, they, require, extra, neutrons, to, be, stable, 461, while, a, free, neutron, is, unstable, and, a, free, proton, is, stable, within, nuclei, neutrons, are, often, stable, and, protons, are, sometimes, unstable, when, bound, within, a, nucleus, nucleons, can, decay, by, the, beta, decay, process, the, neutrons, and, protons, in, a, nucleus, form, a, quantum, mechanical, system, according, to, the, nuclear, shell, model, protons, and, neutrons, of, a, nuclide, are, organized, into, discrete, hierarchical, energy, levels, with, unique, quantum, numbers, nucleon, decay, within, a, nucleus, can, occur, if, allowed, by, basic, energy, conservation, and, quantum, mechanical, constraints, the, decay, products, that, is, the, emitted, particles, carry, away, the, energy, excess, as, a, nucleon, falls, from, one, quantum, state, to, one, with, less, energy, while, the, neutron, or, proton, changes, to, a, proton, or, neutron, for, a, neutron, to, decay, the, resulting, proton, requires, an, available, state, at, lower, energy, than, the, initial, neutron, state, in, stable, nuclei, the, possible, lower, energy, states, are, all, filled, meaning, each, state, is, occupied, by, a, pair, of, protons, one, with, spin, up, another, with, spin, down, when, all, available, proton, states, are, filled, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, disallows, the, decay, of, a, neutron, to, a, proton, 3, 3, the, situation, is, similar, to, electrons, of, an, atom, where, electrons, that, occupy, distinct, atomic, orbitals, are, prevented, by, the, exclusion, principle, from, decaying, to, lower, already, occupied, energy, states, 3, 3, the, stability, of, matter, is, a, consequences, of, these, constraints, the, decay, of, a, neutron, within, a, nuclide, is, illustrated, by, the, decay, of, the, carbon, isotope, carbon, 14, which, has, 6, protons, and, 8, neutrons, with, its, excess, of, neutrons, this, isotope, decays, by, beta, decay, to, nitrogen, 14, 7, protons, 7, neutrons, a, process, with, a, half, life, of, about, 5, 730, years, nitrogen, 14, is, stable, beta, decay, reactions, can, also, occur, by, the, capture, of, a, lepton, by, the, nucleon, the, transformation, of, a, proton, to, a, neutron, inside, of, a, nucleus, is, possible, through, electron, capture, a, rarer, reaction, inverse, beta, decay, involves, the, capture, of, a, neutrino, by, a, nucleon, rarer, still, positron, capture, by, neutrons, can, occur, in, the, high, temperature, environment, of, stars, three, types, of, beta, decay, in, competition, are, illustrated, by, the, single, isotope, copper, 64, 29, protons, 35, neutrons, which, has, a, half, life, of, about, 12, 7, hours, this, isotope, has, one, unpaired, proton, and, one, unpaired, neutron, so, either, the, proton, or, the, neutron, can, decay, this, particular, nuclide, is, almost, equally, likely, to, undergo, proton, decay, by, positron, emission, 18, or, by, electron, capture, 43, both, forming, 64, ni, or, neutron, decay, by, electron, emission, 39, forming, 64, zn, within, the, theoretical, framework, of, the, standard, model, for, particle, physics, a, neutron, comprises, two, down, quarks, with, charge, 1, 3, e, and, one, up, quark, with, charge, 2, 3, e, the, neutron, is, therefore, a, composite, particle, classified, as, a, hadron, the, neutron, is, also, classified, as, a, baryon, because, it, is, composed, of, three, valence, quarks, the, finite, size, of, the, neutron, and, its, magnetic, moment, both, indicate, that, the, neutron, is, a, composite, rather, than, elementary, particle, the, quarks, of, the, neutron, are, held, together, by, the, strong, force, mediated, by, gluons, the, nuclear, force, results, from, secondary, effects, of, the, more, fundamental, strong, force, the, only, possible, decay, mode, for, the, neutron, that, conserves, baryon, number, is, for, one, of, the, neutron, s, quarks, to, change, flavour, via, the, weak, interaction, the, decay, of, one, of, the, neutron, s, down, quarks, into, a, lighter, up, quark, can, be, achieved, by, the, emission, of, a, w, boson, by, this, process, the, standard, model, description, of, beta, decay, the, neutron, decays, into, a, proton, which, contains, one, down, and, two, up, quarks, an, electron, and, an, electron, antineutrino, the, decay, of, the, proton, to, a, neutron, occurs, similarly, through, the, weak, force, the, decay, of, one, of, the, proton, s, up, quarks, into, a, down, quark, can, be, achieved, by, the, emission, of, a, w, boson, the, proton, decays, into, a, neutron, a, positron, and, an, electron, neutrino, this, reaction, can, only, occur, within, an, atomic, nucleus, which, has, a, quantum, state, at, lower, energy, available, for, the, created, neutron, the, story, of, the, discovery, of, the, neutron, and, its, properties, is, central, to, the, extraordinary, developments, in, atomic, physics, that, occurred, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, leading, ultimately, to, the, atomic, bomb, in, 1945, in, the, 1911, rutherford, model, the, atom, consisted, of, a, small, positively, charged, massive, nucleus, surrounded, by, a, much, larger, cloud, of, negatively, charged, electrons, in, 1920, ernest, rutherford, suggested, that, the, nucleus, consisted, of, positive, protons, and, neutrally, charged, particles, suggested, to, be, a, proton, and, an, electron, bound, in, some, way, electrons, were, assumed, to, reside, within, the, nucleus, because, it, was, known, that, beta, radiation, consisted, of, electrons, emitted, from, the, nucleus, about, the, time, rutherford, suggested, the, neutral, proton, electron, composite, several, other, publications, appeared, making, similar, suggestions, and, in, 1921, the, american, chemist, w, d, harkins, first, named, the, hypothetical, particle, a, neutron, the, name, derives, from, the, latin, root, for, neutralis, neuter, and, the, greek, suffix, on, a, suffix, used, in, the, names, of, subatomic, particles, i, e, electron, and, proton, references, to, the, word, neutron, in, connection, with, the, atom, can, be, found, in, the, literature, as, early, as, 1899, however, throughout, the, 1920s, physicists, assumed, that, the, atomic, nucleus, was, composed, of, protons, and, nuclear, electrons, but, this, raised, obvious, problems, it, was, difficult, to, reconcile, the, proton, electron, model, of, the, nucleus, with, the, heisenberg, uncertainty, relation, of, quantum, mechanics, the, klein, paradox, discovered, by, oskar, klein, in, 1928, presented, further, quantum, mechanical, objections, to, the, notion, of, an, electron, confined, within, a, nucleus, the, observed, properties, of, atoms, and, molecules, were, inconsistent, with, the, nuclear, spin, expected, from, the, proton, electron, hypothesis, protons, and, electrons, both, carry, an, intrinsic, spin, of, 1, 2, and, the, isotopes, of, the, same, species, were, found, to, have, either, integer, or, fractional, spin, by, the, hypothesis, isotopes, would, be, composed, of, the, same, number, of, protons, but, differing, numbers, of, neutral, bound, proton, electron, particles, this, physical, picture, was, a, contradiction, since, there, is, no, way, to, arrange, the, spins, of, an, electron, and, a, proton, in, a, bound, state, to, get, a, fractional, spin, in, 1931, walther, bothe, and, herbert, becker, found, that, if, alpha, particle, radiation, from, polonium, fell, on, beryllium, boron, or, lithium, an, unusually, penetrating, radiation, was, produced, the, radiation, was, not, influenced, by, an, electric, field, so, bothe, and, becker, assumed, it, was, gamma, radiation, the, following, year, ir, ne, joliot, curie, and, fr, d, ric, joliot, curie, in, paris, showed, that, if, this, gamma, radiation, fell, on, paraffin, or, any, other, hydrogen, containing, compound, it, ejected, protons, of, very, high, energy, neither, rutherford, nor, james, chadwick, at, the, cavendish, laboratory, in, cambridge, were, convinced, by, the, gamma, ray, interpretation, chadwick, quickly, performed, a, series, of, experiments, that, showed, that, the, new, radiation, consisted, of, uncharged, particles, with, about, the, same, mass, as, the, proton, these, properties, matched, rutherford, s, hypothesized, neutron, chadwick, won, the, 1935, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, this, discovery, models, for, an, atomic, nucleus, consisting, of, protons, and, neutrons, were, quickly, developed, by, werner, heisenberg, and, others, the, proton, neutron, model, explained, the, puzzle, of, nuclear, spins, the, origins, of, beta, radiation, were, explained, by, enrico, fermi, in, 1934, by, the, process, of, beta, decay, in, which, the, neutron, decays, to, a, proton, by, creating, an, electron, and, a, at, the, time, undiscovered, neutrino, in, 1935, chadwick, and, his, doctoral, student, maurice, goldhaber, reported, the, first, accurate, measurement, of, the, mass, of, the, neutron, by, 1934, fermi, had, bombarded, heavier, elements, with, neutrons, to, induce, radioactivity, in, elements, of, high, atomic, number, in, 1938, fermi, received, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, his, demonstrations, of, the, existence, of, new, radioactive, elements, produced, by, neutron, irradiation, and, for, his, related, discovery, of, nuclear, reactions, brought, about, by, slow, neutrons, in, december, 1938, otto, hahn, lise, meitner, and, fritz, strassmann, discovered, nuclear, fission, or, the, fractionation, of, uranium, nuclei, into, lighter, elements, induced, by, neutron, bombardment, in, 1945, hahn, received, the, 1944, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, for, his, discovery, of, the, fission, of, heavy, atomic, nuclei, the, discovery, of, nuclear, fission, would, lead, to, the, development, of, nuclear, power, and, the, atomic, bomb, by, the, end, of, world, war, ii, it, was, quickly, realized, that, if, a, fission, event, produced, neutrons, each, of, these, neutrons, might, cause, further, fission, events, in, a, cascade, known, as, a, nuclear, chain, reaction, 460, 461, these, events, and, findings, led, fermi, to, construct, the, chicago, pile, 1, at, the, university, of, chicago, in, 1942, the, first, self, sustaining, nuclear, reactor, just, three, years, later, the, manhattan, project, was, able, to, test, the, first, atomic, bomb, the, trinity, nuclear, test, in, july, 1945, the, mass, of, a, neutron, cannot, be, directly, determined, by, mass, spectrometry, since, it, has, no, electric, charge, but, since, the, masses, of, a, proton, and, of, a, deuteron, can, be, measured, with, a, mass, spectrometer, the, mass, of, a, neutron, can, be, deduced, by, subtracting, proton, mass, from, deuteron, mass, with, the, difference, being, the, mass, of, the, neutron, plus, the, binding, energy, of, deuterium, expressed, as, a, positive, emitted, energy, the, latter, can, be, directly, measured, by, measuring, the, energy, b, d, displaystyle, b, d, of, the, single, 2, 224, mev, gamma, photon, emitted, when, a, deuteron, is, formed, by, a, proton, capturing, a, neutron, this, is, exothermic, and, happens, with, zero, energy, neutrons, the, small, recoil, kinetic, energy, e, r, d, displaystyle, e, rd, of, the, deuteron, about, 0, 06, of, the, total, energy, must, also, be, accounted, for, the, energy, of, the, gamma, ray, can, be, measured, to, high, precision, by, x, ray, diffraction, techniques, as, was, first, done, by, bell, and, elliot, in, 1948, the, best, modern, 1986, values, for, neutron, mass, by, this, technique, are, provided, by, greene, et, al, these, give, a, neutron, mass, of, the, value, for, the, neutron, mass, in, mev, is, less, accurately, known, due, to, less, accuracy, in, the, known, conversion, of, da, to, mev, c, 2, 18, 19, another, method, to, determine, the, mass, of, a, neutron, starts, from, the, beta, decay, of, the, neutron, when, the, momenta, of, the, resulting, proton, and, electron, are, measured, the, neutron, is, a, spin, 1, 2, particle, that, is, it, is, a, fermion, with, intrinsic, angular, momentum, equal, to, 1, 2, where, is, the, reduced, planck, constant, for, many, years, after, the, discovery, of, the, neutron, its, exact, spin, was, ambiguous, although, it, was, assumed, to, be, a, spin, 1, 2, dirac, particle, the, possibility, that, the, neutron, was, a, spin, 3, 2, particle, lingered, the, interactions, of, the, neutron, s, magnetic, moment, with, an, external, magnetic, field, were, exploited, to, finally, determine, the, spin, of, the, neutron, in, 1949, hughes, and, burgy, measured, neutrons, reflected, from, a, ferromagnetic, mirror, and, found, that, the, angular, distribution, of, the, reflections, was, consistent, with, spin, 1, 2, in, 1954, sherwood, stephenson, and, bernstein, employed, neutrons, in, a, stern, gerlach, experiment, that, used, a, magnetic, field, to, separate, the, neutron, spin, states, they, recorded, two, such, spin, states, consistent, with, a, spin, 1, 2, particle, as, a, fermion, the, neutron, is, subject, to, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, two, neutrons, cannot, have, the, same, quantum, numbers, this, is, the, source, of, the, degeneracy, pressure, which, counteracts, gravity, in, neutron, stars, and, prevents, them, from, forming, black, holes, even, though, the, neutron, is, a, neutral, particle, the, magnetic, moment, of, a, neutron, is, not, zero, the, neutron, is, not, affected, by, electric, fields, but, it, is, affected, by, magnetic, fields, the, value, for, the, neutron, s, magnetic, moment, was, first, directly, measured, by, luis, alvarez, and, felix, bloch, at, berkeley, california, in, 1940, alvarez, and, bloch, determined, the, magnetic, moment, of, the, neutron, to, be, n, 1, 93, 2, n, where, n, is, the, nuclear, magneton, the, neutron, s, magnetic, moment, has, a, negative, value, because, its, orientation, is, opposite, to, the, neutron, s, spin, the, magnetic, moment, of, the, neutron, is, an, indication, of, its, quark, substructure, and, internal, charge, distribution, in, the, quark, model, for, hadrons, the, neutron, is, composed, of, one, up, quark, charge, 2, 3, e, and, two, down, quarks, charge, 1, 3, e, the, magnetic, moment, of, the, neutron, can, be, modeled, as, a, sum, of, the, magnetic, moments, of, the, constituent, quarks, the, calculation, assumes, that, the, quarks, behave, like, point, like, dirac, particles, each, having, their, own, magnetic, moment, simplistically, the, magnetic, moment, of, the, neutron, can, be, viewed, as, resulting, from, the, vector, sum, of, the, three, quark, magnetic, moments, plus, the, orbital, magnetic, moments, caused, by, the, movement, of, the, three, charged, quarks, within, the, neutron, in, one, of, the, early, successes, of, the, standard, model, in, 1964, mirza, a, b, beg, benjamin, w, lee, and, abraham, pais, calculated, the, ratio, of, proton, to, neutron, magnetic, moments, to, be, 3, 2, or, a, ratio, of, 1, 5, which, agrees, with, the, experimental, value, to, within, 3, the, measured, value, for, this, ratio, is, 1, 459, 898, 05, 34, the, above, treatment, compares, neutrons, with, protons, allowing, the, complex, behavior, of, quarks, to, be, subtracted, out, between, models, and, merely, exploring, what, the, effects, would, be, of, differing, quark, charges, or, quark, type, such, calculations, are, enough, to, show, that, the, interior, of, neutrons, is, very, much, like, that, of, protons, save, for, the, difference, in, quark, composition, with, a, down, quark, in, the, neutron, replacing, an, up, quark, in, the, proton, the, neutron, magnetic, moment, can, be, roughly, computed, by, assuming, a, simple, nonrelativistic, quantum, mechanical, wavefunction, for, baryons, composed, of, three, quarks, a, straightforward, calculation, gives, fairly, accurate, estimates, for, the, magnetic, moments, of, neutrons, protons, and, other, baryons, for, a, neutron, the, result, of, this, calculation, is, that, the, magnetic, moment, of, the, neutron, is, given, by, n, 4, 3, d, 1, 3, u, where, d, and, u, are, the, magnetic, moments, for, the, down, and, up, quarks, respectively, this, result, combines, the, intrinsic, magnetic, moments, of, the, quarks, with, their, orbital, magnetic, moments, and, assumes, the, three, quarks, are, in, a, particular, dominant, quantum, state, the, results, of, this, calculation, are, encouraging, but, the, masses, of, the, up, or, down, quarks, were, assumed, to, be, 1, 3, the, mass, of, a, nucleon, the, masses, of, the, quarks, are, actually, only, about, 1, that, of, a, nucleon, the, discrepancy, stems, from, the, complexity, of, the, standard, model, for, nucleons, where, most, of, their, mass, originates, in, the, gluon, fields, virtual, particles, and, their, associated, energy, that, are, essential, aspects, of, the, strong, force, furthermore, the, complex, system, of, quarks, and, gluons, that, constitute, a, neutron, requires, a, relativistic, treatment, but, the, nucleon, magnetic, moment, has, been, successfully, computed, numerically, from, first, principles, including, all, of, the, effects, mentioned, and, using, more, realistic, values, for, the, quark, masses, the, calculation, gave, results, that, were, in, fair, agreement, with, measurement, but, it, required, significant, computing, resources, the, total, electric, charge, of, the, neutron, is, 0, e, this, zero, value, has, been, tested, experimentally, and, the, present, experimental, limit, for, the, charge, of, the, neutron, is, 2, 8, 10, 22, e, or, 3, 13, 10, 41, c, this, value, is, consistent, with, zero, given, the, experimental, uncertainties, indicated, in, parentheses, by, comparison, the, charge, of, the, proton, is, 1, e, an, article, published, in, 2007, featuring, a, model, independent, analysis, concluded, that, the, neutron, has, a, negatively, charged, exterior, a, positively, charged, middle, and, a, negative, core, in, a, simplified, classical, view, the, negative, skin, of, the, neutron, assists, it, to, be, attracted, to, the, protons, with, which, it, interacts, in, the, nucleus, but, the, main, attraction, between, neutrons, and, protons, is, via, the, nuclear, force, which, does, not, involve, electric, charge, the, simplified, classical, view, of, the, neutron, s, charge, distribution, also, explains, the, fact, that, the, neutron, magnetic, dipole, points, in, the, opposite, direction, from, its, spin, angular, momentum, vector, as, compared, to, the, proton, this, gives, the, neutron, in, effect, a, magnetic, moment, which, resembles, a, negatively, charged, particle, this, can, be, reconciled, classically, with, a, neutral, neutron, composed, of, a, charge, distribution, in, which, the, negative, sub, parts, of, the, neutron, have, a, larger, average, radius, of, distribution, and, therefore, contribute, more, to, the, particle, s, magnetic, dipole, moment, than, do, the, positive, parts, that, are, on, average, nearer, the, core, the, standard, model, of, particle, physics, predicts, a, tiny, separation, of, positive, and, negative, charge, within, the, neutron, leading, to, a, permanent, electric, dipole, moment, but, the, predicted, value, is, well, below, the, current, sensitivity, of, experiments, from, several, unsolved, puzzles, in, particle, physics, it, is, clear, that, the, standard, model, is, not, the, final, and, full, description, of, all, particles, and, their, interactions, new, theories, going, beyond, the, standard, model, generally, lead, to, much, larger, predictions, for, the, electric, dipole, moment, of, the, neutron, currently, there, are, at, least, four, experiments, trying, to, measure, for, the, first, time, a, finite, neutron, electric, dipole, moment, including, the, antineutron, is, the, antiparticle, of, the, neutron, it, was, discovered, by, bruce, cork, in, 1956, a, year, after, the, antiproton, was, discovered, cpt, symmetry, puts, strong, constraints, on, the, relative, properties, of, particles, and, antiparticles, so, studying, antineutrons, provides, stringent, tests, on, cpt, symmetry, the, fractional, difference, in, the, masses, of, the, neutron, and, antineutron, is, 9, 6, 10, 5, since, the, difference, is, only, about, two, standard, deviations, away, from, zero, this, does, not, give, any, convincing, evidence, of, cpt, violation, the, dineutron, is, considered, an, unbound, isotope, with, lifetimes, around, 10, 22, seconds, the, first, evidence, for, this, state, was, reported, by, haddock, et, al, in, 1965, 275, in, 2012, artemis, spyrou, from, michigan, state, university, and, coworkers, reported, that, they, observed, for, the, first, time, direct, dineutron, emission, in, the, decay, of, 16, be, the, dineutron, character, is, evidenced, by, a, small, emission, angle, between, the, two, neutrons, the, authors, measured, the, two, neutron, separation, energy, to, be, 1, 35, 10, mev, in, good, agreement, with, shell, model, calculations, using, standard, interactions, for, this, mass, region, evidence, for, unbound, clusters, of, 4, neutrons, or, tetraneutron, as, resonances, in, the, disintegration, of, beryllium, 14, nuclei, in, 8, he, 8, be, interactions, and, collisions, of, 4, he, nuclei, give, an, estimated, lifetime, around, 10, 22, seconds, these, discoveries, should, deepen, our, understanding, of, the, nuclear, forces, at, extremely, high, pressures, and, temperatures, nucleons, and, electrons, are, believed, to, collapse, into, bulk, neutronic, matter, called, neutron, matter, this, is, presumed, to, happen, in, neutron, stars, the, extreme, pressure, inside, a, neutron, star, may, deform, the, neutrons, into, a, cubic, symmetry, allowing, tighter, packing, of, neutrons, the, common, means, of, detecting, a, charged, particle, by, looking, for, a, track, of, ionization, such, as, in, a, cloud, chamber, does, not, work, for, neutrons, directly, neutrons, that, elastically, scatter, off, atoms, can, create, an, ionization, track, that, is, detectable, but, the, experiments, are, not, as, simple, to, carry, out, other, means, for, detecting, neutrons, consisting, of, allowing, them, to, interact, with, atomic, nuclei, are, more, commonly, used, the, commonly, used, methods, to, detect, neutrons, can, therefore, be, categorized, according, to, the, nuclear, processes, relied, upon, mainly, neutron, capture, or, elastic, scattering, a, common, method, for, detecting, neutrons, involves, converting, the, energy, released, from, neutron, capture, reactions, into, electrical, signals, certain, nuclides, have, a, high, neutron, capture, cross, section, which, is, the, probability, of, absorbing, a, neutron, upon, neutron, capture, the, compound, nucleus, emits, more, easily, detectable, radiation, for, example, an, alpha, particle, which, is, then, detected, the, nuclides, 3, he, 6, li, 10, b, 233, u, 235, u, 237, np, and, 239, pu, are, useful, for, this, purpose, neutrons, can, elastically, scatter, off, nuclei, causing, the, struck, nucleus, to, recoil, kinematically, a, neutron, can, transfer, more, energy, to, a, light, nucleus, such, as, hydrogen, or, helium, than, to, a, heavier, nucleus, detectors, relying, on, elastic, scattering, are, called, fast, neutron, detectors, recoiling, nuclei, can, ionize, and, excite, further, atoms, through, collisions, charge, and, or, scintillation, light, produced, in, this, way, can, be, collected, to, produce, a, detected, signal, a, major, challenge, in, fast, neutron, detection, is, discerning, such, signals, from, erroneous, signals, produced, by, gamma, radiation, in, the, same, detector, methods, such, as, pulse, shape, discrimination, can, be, used, in, distinguishing, neutron, signals, from, gamma, ray, signals, although, certain, inorganic, scintillator, based, detectors, have, been, developed, to, selectively, detect, neutrons, in, mixed, radiation, fields, inherently, without, any, additional, techniques, fast, neutron, detectors, have, the, advantage, of, not, requiring, a, moderator, and, are, therefore, capable, of, measuring, the, neutron, s, energy, time, of, arrival, and, in, certain, cases, direction, of, incidence, free, neutrons, are, unstable, although, they, have, the, longest, half, life, of, any, unstable, subatomic, particle, by, several, orders, of, magnitude, their, half, life, is, still, only, about, 10, minutes, so, they, can, be, obtained, only, from, sources, that, produce, them, continuously, natural, neutron, background, a, small, natural, background, flux, of, free, neutrons, exists, everywhere, on, earth, in, the, atmosphere, and, deep, into, the, ocean, the, neutron, background, is, caused, by, muons, produced, by, cosmic, ray, interaction, with, the, atmosphere, these, high, energy, muons, are, capable, of, penetration, to, considerable, depths, in, water, and, soil, there, in, striking, atomic, nuclei, among, other, reactions, they, induce, spallation, reactions, in, which, a, neutron, is, liberated, from, the, nucleus, within, the, earth, s, crust, a, second, source, is, neutrons, produced, primarily, by, spontaneous, fission, of, uranium, and, thorium, present, in, crustal, minerals, the, neutron, background, is, not, strong, enough, to, be, a, biological, hazard, but, it, is, of, importance, to, very, high, resolution, particle, detectors, that, are, looking, for, very, rare, events, such, as, hypothesized, interactions, that, might, be, caused, by, particles, of, dark, matter, recent, research, has, shown, that, even, thunderstorms, can, produce, neutrons, with, energies, of, up, to, several, tens, of, mev, recent, research, has, shown, that, the, fluence, of, these, neutrons, lies, between, 10, 9, and, 10, 13, per, ms, and, per, m, 2, depending, on, the, detection, altitude, the, energy, of, most, of, these, neutrons, even, with, initial, energies, of, 20, mev, decreases, down, to, the, kev, range, within, 1, ms, even, stronger, neutron, background, radiation, is, produced, at, the, surface, of, mars, where, the, atmosphere, is, thick, enough, to, generate, neutrons, from, cosmic, ray, muon, production, and, neutron, spallation, but, not, thick, enough, to, provide, significant, protection, from, the, neutrons, produced, these, neutrons, not, only, produce, a, martian, surface, neutron, radiation, hazard, from, direct, downward, going, neutron, radiation, but, may, also, produce, a, significant, hazard, from, reflection, of, neutrons, from, the, martian, surface, which, will, produce, reflected, neutron, radiation, penetrating, upward, into, a, martian, craft, or, habitat, from, the, floor, sources, of, neutrons, for, research, these, include, certain, types, of, radioactive, decay, spontaneous, fission, and, neutron, emission, and, from, certain, nuclear, reactions, convenient, nuclear, reactions, include, tabletop, reactions, such, as, natural, alpha, and, gamma, bombardment, of, certain, nuclides, often, beryllium, or, deuterium, and, induced, nuclear, fission, such, as, occurs, in, nuclear, reactors, in, addition, high, energy, nuclear, reactions, such, as, occur, in, cosmic, radiation, showers, or, accelerator, collisions, also, produce, neutrons, from, disintegration, of, target, nuclei, small, tabletop, particle, accelerators, optimized, to, produce, free, neutrons, in, this, way, are, called, neutron, generators, in, practice, the, most, commonly, used, small, laboratory, sources, of, neutrons, use, radioactive, decay, to, power, neutron, production, one, noted, neutron, producing, radioisotope, californium, 252, decays, half, life, 2, 65, years, by, spontaneous, fission, 3, of, the, time, with, production, of, 3, 7, neutrons, per, fission, and, is, used, alone, as, a, neutron, source, from, this, process, nuclear, reaction, sources, that, involve, two, materials, powered, by, radioisotopes, use, an, alpha, decay, source, plus, a, beryllium, target, or, else, a, source, of, high, energy, gamma, radiation, from, a, source, that, undergoes, beta, decay, followed, by, gamma, decay, which, produces, photoneutrons, on, interaction, of, the, high, energy, gamma, ray, with, ordinary, stable, beryllium, or, else, with, the, deuterium, in, heavy, water, a, popular, source, of, the, latter, type, is, radioactive, antimony, 124, plus, beryllium, a, system, with, a, half, life, of, 60, 9, days, which, can, be, constructed, from, natural, antimony, which, is, 42, 8, stable, antimony, 123, by, activating, it, with, neutrons, in, a, nuclear, reactor, then, transported, to, where, the, neutron, source, is, needed, nuclear, fission, reactors, naturally, produce, free, neutrons, their, role, is, to, sustain, the, energy, producing, chain, reaction, the, intense, neutron, radiation, can, also, be, used, to, produce, various, radioisotopes, through, the, process, of, neutron, activation, which, is, a, type, of, neutron, capture, experimental, nuclear, fusion, reactors, produce, free, neutrons, as, a, waste, product, but, it, is, these, neutrons, that, possess, most, of, the, energy, and, converting, that, energy, to, a, useful, form, has, proved, a, difficult, engineering, challenge, fusion, reactors, that, generate, neutrons, are, likely, to, create, radioactive, waste, but, the, waste, is, composed, of, neutron, activated, lighter, isotopes, which, have, relatively, short, 50, 100, years, decay, periods, as, compared, to, typical, half, lives, of, 10, 000, years, for, fission, waste, which, is, long, due, primarily, to, the, long, half, life, of, alpha, emitting, transuranic, actinides, some, nuclear, fusion, fission, hybrids, are, proposed, to, make, use, of, those, neutrons, to, either, maintain, a, subcritical, reactor, or, to, aid, in, nuclear, transmutation, of, harmful, long, lived, nuclear, waste, to, shorter, lived, or, stable, nuclides, free, neutron, beams, are, obtained, from, neutron, sources, by, neutron, transport, for, access, to, intense, neutron, sources, researchers, must, go, to, a, specialized, neutron, facility, that, operates, a, research, reactor, or, a, spallation, source, the, neutron, s, lack, of, total, electric, charge, makes, it, difficult, to, steer, or, accelerate, them, charged, particles, can, be, accelerated, decelerated, or, deflected, by, electric, or, magnetic, fields, these, methods, have, little, effect, on, neutrons, but, some, effects, may, be, attained, by, use, of, inhomogeneous, magnetic, fields, because, of, the, neutron, s, magnetic, moment, neutrons, can, be, controlled, by, methods, that, include, moderation, reflection, and, velocity, selection, thermal, neutrons, can, be, polarized, by, transmission, through, magnetic, materials, in, a, method, analogous, to, the, faraday, effect, for, photons, cold, neutrons, of, wavelengths, of, 6, 7, angstroms, can, be, produced, in, beams, of, a, high, degree, of, polarization, by, use, of, magnetic, mirrors, and, magnetized, interference, filters, the, neutron, plays, an, important, role, in, many, nuclear, reactions, for, example, neutron, capture, often, results, in, neutron, activation, inducing, radioactivity, in, particular, knowledge, of, neutrons, and, their, behavior, has, been, important, in, the, development, of, nuclear, reactors, and, nuclear, weapons, the, fissioning, of, elements, like, uranium, 235, and, plutonium, 239, is, caused, by, their, absorption, of, neutrons, cold, thermal, and, hot, neutron, radiation, is, commonly, employed, in, neutron, scattering, facilities, for, neutron, diffraction, small, angle, neutron, scattering, and, neutron, reflectometry, slow, neutron, matter, waves, exhibit, properties, similar, to, geometrical, and, wave, optics, of, light, including, reflection, refraction, diffraction, and, interference, neutrons, are, complementary, to, x, rays, in, terms, of, atomic, contrasts, by, different, scattering, cross, sections, sensitivity, to, magnetism, energy, range, for, inelastic, neutron, spectroscopy, and, deep, penetration, into, matter, the, development, of, neutron, lenses, based, on, total, internal, reflection, within, hollow, glass, capillary, tubes, or, by, reflection, from, dimpled, aluminum, plates, has, driven, ongoing, research, into, neutron, microscopy, and, neutron, gamma, ray, tomography, a, major, use, of, neutrons, is, to, excite, delayed, and, prompt, gamma, rays, from, elements, in, materials, this, forms, the, basis, of, neutron, activation, analysis, naa, and, prompt, gamma, neutron, activation, analysis, pgnaa, naa, is, most, often, used, to, analyze, small, samples, of, materials, in, a, nuclear, reactor, whilst, pgnaa, is, most, often, used, to, analyze, subterranean, rocks, around, bore, holes, and, industrial, bulk, materials, on, conveyor, belts, another, use, of, neutron, emitters, is, the, detection, of, light, nuclei, in, particular, the, hydrogen, found, in, water, molecules, when, a, fast, neutron, collides, with, a, light, nucleus, it, loses, a, large, fraction, of, its, energy, by, measuring, the, rate, at, which, slow, neutrons, return, to, the, probe, after, reflecting, off, of, hydrogen, nuclei, a, neutron, probe, may, determine, the, water, content, in, soil, because, neutron, radiation, is, both, penetrating, and, ionizing, it, can, be, exploited, for, medical, treatments, however, neutron, radiation, can, have, the, unfortunate, side, effect, of, leaving, the, affected, area, radioactive, neutron, tomography, is, therefore, not, a, viable, medical, application, fast, neutron, therapy, uses, high, energy, neutrons, typically, greater, than, 20, mev, to, treat, cancer, radiation, therapy, of, cancers, is, based, upon, the, biological, response, of, cells, to, ionizing, radiation, if, radiation, is, delivered, in, small, sessions, to, damage, cancerous, areas, normal, tissue, will, have, time, to, repair, itself, while, tumor, cells, often, cannot, neutron, radiation, can, deliver, energy, to, a, cancerous, region, at, a, rate, an, order, of, magnitude, larger, than, gamma, radiation, beams, of, low, energy, neutrons, are, used, in, boron, neutron, capture, therapy, to, treat, cancer, in, boron, neutron, capture, therapy, the, patient, is, given, a, drug, that, contains, boron, and, that, preferentially, accumulates, in, the, tumor, to, be, targeted, the, tumor, is, then, bombarded, with, very, low, energy, neutrons, although, often, higher, than, thermal, energy, which, are, captured, by, the, boron, 10, isotope, in, the, boron, which, produces, an, excited, state, of, boron, 11, that, then, decays, to, produce, lithium, 7, and, an, alpha, particle, that, have, sufficient, energy, to, kill, the, malignant, cell, but, insufficient, range, to, damage, nearby, cells, for, such, a, therapy, to, be, applied, to, the, treatment, of, cancer, a, neutron, source, having, an, intensity, of, the, order, of, a, thousand, million, 10, 9, neutrons, per, second, per, cm, 2, is, preferred, such, fluxes, require, a, research, nuclear, reactor, exposure, to, free, neutrons, can, be, hazardous, since, the, interaction, of, neutrons, with, molecules, in, the, body, can, cause, disruption, to, molecules, and, atoms, and, can, also, cause, reactions, that, give, rise, to, other, forms, of, radiation, such, as, protons, the, normal, precautions, of, radiation, protection, apply, avoid, exposure, stay, as, far, from, the, source, as, possible, and, keep, exposure, time, to, a, minimum, but, particular, thought, must, be, given, to, how, to, protect, from, neutron, exposure, for, other, types, of, radiation, e, g, alpha, particles, beta, particles, or, gamma, rays, material, of, a, high, atomic, number, and, with, high, density, makes, for, good, shielding, frequently, lead, is, used, however, this, approach, will, not, work, with, neutrons, since, the, absorption, of, neutrons, does, not, increase, straightforwardly, with, atomic, number, as, it, does, with, alpha, beta, and, gamma, radiation, instead, one, needs, to, look, at, the, particular, interactions, neutrons, have, with, matter, see, the, section, on, detection, above, for, example, hydrogen, rich, materials, are, often, used, to, shield, against, neutrons, since, ordinary, hydrogen, both, scatters, and, slows, neutrons, this, often, means, that, simple, concrete, blocks, or, even, paraffin, loaded, plastic, blocks, afford, better, protection, from, neutrons, than, do, far, more, dense, materials, after, slowing, neutrons, may, then, be, absorbed, with, an, isotope, that, has, high, affinity, for, slow, neutrons, without, causing, secondary, capture, radiation, such, as, lithium, 6, hydrogen, rich, ordinary, water, effects, neutron, absorption, in, nuclear, fission, reactors, usually, neutrons, are, so, strongly, absorbed, by, normal, water, that, fuel, enrichment, with, a, fissionable, isotope, is, required, the, number, of, neutrons, produced, per, fission, depends, primarily, on, the, fission, products, the, average, is, roughly, 2, 5, to, 3, 0, and, at, least, one, on, average, must, evade, capture, in, order, to, sustain, the, nuclear, chain, reaction, the, deuterium, in, heavy, water, has, a, very, much, lower, absorption, affinity, for, neutrons, than, does, protium, normal, light, hydrogen, deuterium, is, therefore, used, in, candu, type, reactors, in, order, to, slow, moderate, neutron, velocity, to, increase, the, probability, of, nuclear, fission, compared, to, neutron, capture, thermal, neutrons, are, free, neutrons, whose, energies, have, a, maxwell, boltzmann, distribution, with, kt, 0, 0253, ev, 4, 0, 10, 21, j, at, room, temperature, this, gives, characteristic, not, average, or, median, speed, of, 2, 2, km, s, the, name, thermal, comes, from, their, energy, being, that, of, the, room, temperature, gas, or, material, they, are, permeating, see, kinetic, theory, for, energies, and, speeds, of, molecules, after, a, number, of, collisions, often, in, the, range, of, 10, 20, with, nuclei, neutrons, arrive, at, this, energy, level, provided, that, they, are, not, absorbed, in, many, substances, thermal, neutron, reactions, show, a, much, larger, effective, cross, section, than, reactions, involving, faster, neutrons, and, thermal, neutrons, can, therefore, be, absorbed, more, readily, i, e, with, higher, probability, by, any, atomic, nuclei, that, they, collide, with, creating, a, heavier, and, often, unstable, isotope, of, the, chemical, element, as, a, result, most, fission, reactors, use, a, neutron, moderator, to, slow, down, or, thermalize, the, neutrons, that, are, emitted, by, nuclear, fission, so, that, they, are, more, easily, captured, causing, further, fission, others, called, fast, breeder, reactors, use, fission, energy, neutrons, directly, cold, neutrons, are, thermal, neutrons, that, have, been, equilibrated, in, a, very, cold, substance, such, as, liquid, deuterium, such, a, cold, source, is, placed, in, the, moderator, of, a, research, reactor, or, spallation, source, cold, neutrons, are, particularly, valuable, for, neutron, scattering, experiments, the, use, of, cold, and, very, cold, neutrons, vcn, has, been, a, bit, limited, compared, to, the, use, of, thermal, neutrons, due, to, the, relatively, lower, flux, and, lack, in, optical, components, however, innovative, solutions, have, been, proposed, to, offer, more, options, to, the, scientific, community, to, promote, the, use, of, vcn, ultracold, neutrons, are, produced, by, inelastic, scattering, of, cold, neutrons, in, substances, with, a, low, neutron, absorption, cross, section, at, a, temperature, of, a, few, kelvins, such, as, solid, deuterium, or, superfluid, helium, an, alternative, production, method, is, the, mechanical, deceleration, of, cold, neutrons, exploiting, the, doppler, shift, a, fast, neutron, is, a, free, neutron, with, a, kinetic, energy, level, close, to, 1, mev, 1, 6, 10, 13, j, hence, a, speed, of, 14, 000, km, s, 5, of, the, speed, of, light, they, are, named, fission, energy, or, fast, neutrons, to, distinguish, them, from, lower, energy, thermal, neutrons, and, high, energy, neutrons, produced, in, cosmic, showers, or, accelerators, fast, neutrons, are, produced, by, nuclear, processes, such, as, nuclear, fission, neutrons, produced, in, fission, as, noted, above, have, a, maxwell, boltzmann, distribution, of, kinetic, energies, from, 0, to, 14, mev, a, mean, energy, of, 2, mev, for, 235, u, fission, neutrons, and, a, mode, of, only, 0, 75, mev, which, means, that, more, than, half, of, them, do, not, qualify, as, fast, and, thus, have, almost, no, chance, of, initiating, fission, in, fertile, materials, such, as, 238, u, and, 232, th, fast, neutrons, can, be, made, into, thermal, neutrons, via, a, process, called, moderation, this, is, done, with, a, neutron, moderator, in, reactors, typically, heavy, water, light, water, or, graphite, are, used, to, moderate, neutrons, d, t, deuterium, tritium, fusion, is, the, fusion, reaction, that, produces, the, most, energetic, neutrons, with, 14, 1, mev, of, kinetic, energy, and, traveling, at, 17, of, the, speed, of, light, d, t, fusion, is, also, the, easiest, fusion, reaction, to, ignite, reaching, near, peak, rates, even, when, the, deuterium, and, tritium, nuclei, have, only, a, thousandth, as, much, kinetic, energy, as, the, 14, 1, mev, that, will, be, produced, 14, 1, mev, neutrons, have, about, 10, times, as, much, energy, as, fission, neutrons, and, they, are, very, effective, at, fissioning, even, non, fissile, heavy, nuclei, these, high, energy, fissions, also, produce, more, neutrons, on, average, than, fissions, by, lower, energy, neutrons, d, t, fusion, neutron, sources, such, as, proposed, tokamak, power, reactors, are, therefore, useful, for, transmutation, of, transuranic, waste, 14, 1, mev, neutrons, can, also, produce, neutrons, by, knocking, them, loose, from, nuclei, on, the, other, hand, these, very, high, energy, neutrons, are, less, likely, to, simply, be, captured, without, causing, fission, or, spallation, for, these, reasons, nuclear, weapon, design, extensively, uses, d, t, fusion, 14, 1, mev, neutrons, to, cause, more, fission, fusion, neutrons, are, able, to, cause, fission, in, ordinarily, non, fissile, materials, such, as, depleted, uranium, uranium, 238, and, these, materials, have, been, used, in, the, jackets, of, thermonuclear, weapons, fusion, neutrons, also, can, cause, fission, in, substances, that, are, unsuitable, or, difficult, to, make, into, primary, fission, bombs, such, as, reactor, grade, plutonium, this, physical, fact, thus, causes, ordinary, non, weapons, grade, materials, to, become, of, concern, in, certain, nuclear, proliferation, discussions, and, treaties, other, fusion, reactions, produce, much, less, energetic, neutrons, d, d, fusion, produces, a, 2, 45, mev, neutron, and, helium, 3, half, of, the, time, and, produces, tritium, and, a, proton, but, no, neutron, the, rest, of, the, time, d, 3, he, fusion, produces, no, neutron, a, fission, energy, neutron, that, has, slowed, down, but, not, yet, reached, thermal, energies, is, called, an, epithermal, neutron, cross, sections, for, both, capture, and, fission, reactions, often, have, multiple, resonance, peaks, at, specific, energies, in, the, epithermal, energy, range, these, are, of, less, significance, in, a, fast, neutron, reactor, where, most, neutrons, are, absorbed, before, slowing, down, to, this, range, or, in, a, well, moderated, thermal, reactor, where, epithermal, neutrons, interact, mostly, with, moderator, nuclei, not, with, either, fissile, or, fertile, actinide, nuclides, but, in, a, partially, moderated, reactor, with, more, interactions, of, epithermal, neutrons, with, heavy, metal, nuclei, there, are, greater, possibilities, for, transient, changes, in, reactivity, that, might, make, reactor, control, more, difficult, ratios, of, capture, reactions, to, fission, reactions, are, also, worse, more, captures, without, fission, in, most, nuclear, fuels, such, as, plutonium, 239, making, epithermal, spectrum, reactors, using, these, fuels, less, desirable, as, captures, not, only, waste, the, one, neutron, captured, but, also, usually, result, in, a, nuclide, that, is, not, fissile, with, thermal, or, epithermal, neutrons, though, still, fissionable, with, fast, neutrons, the, exception, is, uranium, 233, of, the, thorium, cycle, which, has, good, capture, fission, ratios, at, all, neutron, energies, high, energy, neutrons, have, much, more, energy, than, fission, energy, neutrons, and, are, generated, as, secondary, particles, by, particle, accelerators, or, in, the, atmosphere, from, cosmic, rays, these, high, energy, neutrons, are, extremely, efficient, at, ionization, and, far, more, likely, to, cause, cell, death, than, x, rays, or, protons
