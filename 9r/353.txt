ozone, o, z, o, n, or, trioxygen, is, an, inorganic, molecule, with, the, chemical, formula, o, 3, it, is, a, pale, blue, gas, with, a, distinctively, pungent, smell, it, is, an, allotrope, of, oxygen, that, is, much, less, stable, than, the, diatomic, allotrope, o, 2, breaking, down, in, the, lower, atmosphere, to, o, 2, dioxygen, ozone, is, formed, from, dioxygen, by, the, action, of, ultraviolet, uv, light, and, electrical, discharges, within, the, earth, s, atmosphere, it, is, present, in, very, low, concentrations, throughout, the, atmosphere, with, its, highest, concentration, high, in, the, ozone, layer, of, the, stratosphere, which, absorbs, most, of, the, sun, s, ultraviolet, uv, radiation, ozone, s, odor, is, reminiscent, of, chlorine, and, detectable, by, many, people, at, concentrations, of, as, little, as, 0, 1, ppm, in, air, ozone, s, o, 3, structure, was, determined, in, 1865, the, molecule, was, later, proven, to, have, a, bent, structure, and, to, be, weakly, diamagnetic, in, standard, conditions, ozone, is, a, pale, blue, gas, that, condenses, at, cryogenic, temperatures, to, a, dark, blue, liquid, and, finally, a, violet, black, solid, ozone, s, instability, with, regard, to, more, common, dioxygen, is, such, that, both, concentrated, gas, and, liquid, ozone, may, decompose, explosively, at, elevated, temperatures, physical, shock, or, fast, warming, to, the, boiling, point, it, is, therefore, used, commercially, only, in, low, concentrations, ozone, is, a, powerful, oxidant, far, more, so, than, dioxygen, and, has, many, industrial, and, consumer, applications, related, to, oxidation, this, same, high, oxidizing, potential, however, causes, ozone, to, damage, mucous, and, respiratory, tissues, in, animals, and, also, tissues, in, plants, above, concentrations, of, about, 0, 1, ppm, while, this, makes, ozone, a, potent, respiratory, hazard, and, pollutant, near, ground, level, a, higher, concentration, in, the, ozone, layer, from, two, to, eight, ppm, is, beneficial, preventing, damaging, uv, light, from, reaching, the, earth, s, surface, the, trivial, name, ozone, is, the, most, commonly, used, and, preferred, iupac, name, the, systematic, names, 2, 4, trioxidiene, and, catena, trioxygen, valid, iupac, names, are, constructed, according, to, the, substitutive, and, additive, nomenclatures, respectively, the, name, ozone, derives, from, ozein, the, greek, neuter, present, participle, for, smell, referring, to, ozone, s, distinctive, smell, in, appropriate, contexts, ozone, can, be, viewed, as, trioxidane, with, two, hydrogen, atoms, removed, and, as, such, trioxidanylidene, may, be, used, as, a, systematic, name, according, to, substitutive, nomenclature, by, default, these, names, pay, no, regard, to, the, radicality, of, the, ozone, molecule, in, an, even, more, specific, context, this, can, also, name, the, non, radical, singlet, ground, state, whereas, the, diradical, state, is, named, trioxidanediyl, trioxidanediyl, or, ozonide, is, used, non, systematically, to, refer, to, the, substituent, group, ooo, care, should, be, taken, to, avoid, confusing, the, name, of, the, group, for, the, context, specific, name, for, the, ozone, given, above, in, 1785, dutch, chemist, martinus, van, marum, was, conducting, experiments, involving, electrical, sparking, above, water, when, he, noticed, an, unusual, smell, which, he, attributed, to, the, electrical, reactions, failing, to, realize, that, he, had, in, fact, created, ozone, a, half, century, later, christian, friedrich, sch, nbein, noticed, the, same, pungent, odour, and, recognized, it, as, the, smell, often, following, a, bolt, of, lightning, in, 1839, he, succeeded, in, isolating, the, gaseous, chemical, and, named, it, ozone, from, the, greek, word, ozein, meaning, to, smell, for, this, reason, sch, nbein, is, generally, credited, with, the, discovery, of, ozone, he, also, noted, the, similarity, of, ozone, smell, to, the, smell, of, phosphorus, and, in, 1844, proved, that, the, product, of, reaction, of, white, phosphorus, with, air, is, identical, a, subsequent, effort, to, call, ozone, electrified, oxygen, he, ridiculed, by, proposing, to, call, the, ozone, from, white, phosphorus, phosphorized, oxygen, the, formula, for, ozone, o, 3, was, not, determined, until, 1865, by, jacques, louis, soret, and, confirmed, by, sch, nbein, in, 1867, for, much, of, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, and, well, into, the, 20th, ozone, was, considered, a, healthy, component, of, the, environment, by, naturalists, and, health, seekers, beaumont, california, had, as, its, official, slogan, beaumont, zone, of, ozone, as, evidenced, on, postcards, and, chamber, of, commerce, letterhead, naturalists, working, outdoors, often, considered, the, higher, elevations, beneficial, because, of, their, ozone, content, there, is, quite, a, different, atmosphere, with, enough, ozone, to, sustain, the, necessary, energy, wrote, naturalist, henry, henshaw, working, in, hawaii, seaside, air, was, considered, to, be, healthy, because, of, its, believed, ozone, content, the, smell, giving, rise, to, this, belief, is, in, fact, that, of, halogenated, seaweed, metabolites, and, dimethyl, sulfide, much, of, ozone, s, appeal, seems, to, have, resulted, from, its, fresh, smell, which, evoked, associations, with, purifying, properties, scientists, noted, its, harmful, effects, in, 1873, james, dewar, and, john, gray, mckendrick, documented, that, frogs, grew, sluggish, birds, gasped, for, breath, and, rabbits, blood, showed, decreased, levels, of, oxygen, after, exposure, to, ozonized, air, which, exercised, a, destructive, action, sch, nbein, himself, reported, that, chest, pains, irritation, of, the, mucous, membranes, and, difficulty, breathing, occurred, as, a, result, of, inhaling, ozone, and, small, mammals, died, in, 1911, leonard, hill, and, martin, flack, stated, in, the, proceedings, of, the, royal, society, b, that, ozone, s, healthful, effects, have, by, mere, iteration, become, part, and, parcel, of, common, belief, and, yet, exact, physiological, evidence, in, favour, of, its, good, effects, has, been, hitherto, almost, entirely, wanting, the, only, thoroughly, well, ascertained, knowledge, concerning, the, physiological, effect, of, ozone, so, far, attained, is, that, it, causes, irritation, and, dema, of, the, lungs, and, death, if, inhaled, in, relatively, strong, concentration, for, any, time, during, world, war, i, ozone, was, tested, at, queen, alexandra, military, hospital, in, london, as, a, possible, disinfectant, for, wounds, the, gas, was, applied, directly, to, wounds, for, as, long, as, 15, minutes, this, resulted, in, damage, to, both, bacterial, cells, and, human, tissue, other, sanitizing, techniques, such, as, irrigation, with, antiseptics, were, found, preferable, until, the, 1920s, it, was, not, certain, whether, small, amounts, of, oxozone, o, 4, were, also, present, in, ozone, samples, due, to, the, difficulty, of, applying, analytical, chemistry, techniques, to, the, explosive, concentrated, chemical, in, 1923, georg, maria, schwab, working, for, his, doctoral, thesis, under, ernst, hermann, riesenfeld, was, the, first, to, successfully, solidify, ozone, and, perform, accurate, analysis, which, conclusively, refuted, the, oxozone, hypothesis, further, hitherto, unmeasured, physical, properties, of, pure, concentrated, ozone, were, determined, by, the, riesenfeld, group, in, the, 1920s, ozone, is, a, colourless, or, pale, blue, gas, slightly, soluble, in, water, and, much, more, soluble, in, inert, non, polar, solvents, such, as, carbon, tetrachloride, or, fluorocarbons, in, which, it, forms, a, blue, solution, at, 161, k, 112, c, 170, f, it, condenses, to, form, a, dark, blue, liquid, it, is, dangerous, to, allow, this, liquid, to, warm, to, its, boiling, point, because, both, concentrated, gaseous, ozone, and, liquid, ozone, can, detonate, at, temperatures, below, 80, k, 193, 2, c, 315, 7, f, it, forms, a, violet, black, solid, most, people, can, detect, about, 0, 01, mol, mol, of, ozone, in, air, where, it, has, a, very, specific, sharp, odour, somewhat, resembling, chlorine, bleach, exposure, of, 0, 1, to, 1, mol, mol, produces, headaches, burning, eyes, and, irritation, to, the, respiratory, passages, even, low, concentrations, of, ozone, in, air, are, very, destructive, to, organic, materials, such, as, latex, plastics, and, animal, lung, tissue, the, ozone, molecule, is, diamagnetic, according, to, experimental, evidence, from, microwave, spectroscopy, ozone, is, a, bent, molecule, with, c, 2v, symmetry, similar, to, the, water, molecule, the, o, o, distances, are, 127, 2, pm, 1, 272, the, o, o, o, angle, is, 116, 78, the, central, atom, is, sp, hybridized, with, one, lone, pair, ozone, is, a, polar, molecule, with, a, dipole, moment, of, 0, 53, d, the, molecule, can, be, represented, as, a, resonance, hybrid, with, two, contributing, structures, each, with, a, single, bond, on, one, side, and, double, bond, on, the, other, the, arrangement, possesses, an, overall, bond, order, of, 1, 5, for, both, sides, it, is, isoelectronic, with, the, nitrite, anion, naturally, occurring, ozone, can, be, composed, of, substituted, isotopes, 16, o, 17, o, 18, o, a, cyclic, form, has, been, predicted, but, not, observed, ozone, is, among, the, most, powerful, oxidizing, agents, known, far, stronger, than, o, 2, it, is, also, unstable, at, high, concentrations, decaying, into, ordinary, diatomic, oxygen, its, half, life, varies, with, atmospheric, conditions, such, as, temperature, humidity, and, air, movement, under, laboratory, conditions, the, half, life, will, average, 1500, minutes, 25, hours, in, still, air, at, room, temperature, 24, c, zero, humidity, with, zero, air, changes, per, hour, this, reaction, proceeds, more, rapidly, with, increasing, temperature, deflagration, of, ozone, can, be, triggered, by, a, spark, and, can, occur, in, ozone, concentrations, of, 10, wt, or, higher, ozone, can, also, be, produced, from, oxygen, at, the, anode, of, an, electrochemical, cell, this, reaction, can, create, smaller, quantities, of, ozone, for, research, purposes, this, can, be, observed, as, an, unwanted, reaction, in, a, hoffman, gas, apparatus, during, the, electrolysis, of, water, when, the, voltage, is, set, above, the, necessary, voltage, ozone, will, oxidize, most, metals, except, gold, platinum, and, iridium, to, oxides, of, the, metals, in, their, highest, oxidation, state, for, example, ozone, also, oxidizes, nitric, oxide, to, nitrogen, dioxide, this, reaction, is, accompanied, by, chemiluminescence, the, no, 2, can, be, further, oxidized, to, nitrate, radical, the, no, 3, formed, can, react, with, no, 2, to, form, dinitrogen, pentoxide, n, 2, o, 5, solid, nitronium, perchlorate, can, be, made, from, no, 2, clo, 2, and, o, 3, gases, ozone, does, not, react, with, ammonium, salts, but, it, oxidizes, ammonia, to, ammonium, nitrate, ozone, reacts, with, carbon, to, form, carbon, dioxide, even, at, room, temperature, ozone, oxidizes, sulfides, to, sulfates, for, example, lead, ii, sulfide, is, oxidized, to, lead, ii, sulfate, sulfuric, acid, can, be, produced, from, ozone, water, and, either, elemental, sulfur, or, sulfur, dioxide, in, the, gas, phase, ozone, reacts, with, hydrogen, sulfide, to, form, sulfur, dioxide, in, an, aqueous, solution, however, two, competing, simultaneous, reactions, occur, one, to, produce, elemental, sulfur, and, one, to, produce, sulfuric, acid, alkenes, can, be, oxidatively, cleaved, by, ozone, in, a, process, called, ozonolysis, giving, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, and, carboxylic, acids, depending, on, the, second, step, of, the, workup, ozone, can, also, cleave, alkynes, to, form, an, acid, anhydride, or, diketone, product, if, the, reaction, is, performed, in, the, presence, of, water, the, anhydride, hydrolyzes, to, give, two, carboxylic, acids, usually, ozonolysis, is, carried, out, in, a, solution, of, dichloromethane, at, a, temperature, of, 78, c, after, a, sequence, of, cleavage, and, rearrangement, an, organic, ozonide, is, formed, with, reductive, workup, e, g, zinc, in, acetic, acid, or, dimethyl, sulfide, ketones, and, aldehydes, will, be, formed, with, oxidative, workup, e, g, aqueous, or, alcoholic, hydrogen, peroxide, carboxylic, acids, will, be, formed, all, three, atoms, of, ozone, may, also, react, as, in, the, reaction, of, tin, ii, chloride, with, hydrochloric, acid, and, ozone, iodine, perchlorate, can, be, made, by, treating, iodine, dissolved, in, cold, anhydrous, perchloric, acid, with, ozone, ozone, could, also, react, with, potassium, iodide, to, give, oxygen, and, iodine, gas, that, can, be, titrated, for, quantitative, determination, ozone, can, be, used, for, combustion, reactions, and, combustible, gases, ozone, provides, higher, temperatures, than, burning, in, dioxygen, o, 2, the, following, is, a, reaction, for, the, combustion, of, carbon, subnitride, which, can, also, cause, higher, temperatures, ozone, can, react, at, cryogenic, temperatures, at, 77, k, 196, 2, c, 321, 1, f, atomic, hydrogen, reacts, with, liquid, ozone, to, form, a, hydrogen, superoxide, radical, which, dimerizes, ozone, is, a, toxic, substance, commonly, found, or, generated, in, human, environments, aircraft, cabins, offices, with, photocopiers, laser, printers, sterilizers, and, its, catalytic, decomposition, is, very, important, to, reduce, pollution, this, type, of, decomposition, is, the, most, widely, used, especially, with, solid, catalysts, and, it, has, many, advantages, such, as, a, higher, conversion, with, a, lower, temperature, furthermore, the, product, and, the, catalyst, can, be, instantaneously, separated, and, this, way, the, catalyst, can, be, easily, recovered, without, using, any, separation, operation, moreover, the, most, used, materials, in, the, catalytic, decomposition, of, ozone, in, the, gas, phase, are, noble, metals, like, pt, rh, or, pd, and, transition, metals, such, as, mn, co, cu, fe, ni, or, ag, there, are, two, other, possibilities, for, the, ozone, decomposition, in, gas, phase, the, first, one, is, a, thermal, decomposition, where, the, ozone, can, be, decomposed, using, only, the, action, of, heat, the, problem, is, that, this, type, of, decomposition, is, very, slow, with, temperatures, below, 250, c, however, the, decomposition, rate, can, be, increased, working, with, higher, temperatures, but, this, would, involve, a, high, energy, cost, the, second, one, is, a, photochemical, decomposition, which, consists, of, radiating, ozone, with, ultraviolet, radiation, uv, and, it, gives, rise, to, oxygen, and, radical, peroxide, the, process, of, ozone, decomposition, is, a, complex, reaction, involving, two, elementary, reactions, that, finally, lead, to, molecular, oxygen, and, this, means, that, the, reaction, order, and, the, rate, law, cannot, be, determined, by, the, stoichiometry, of, the, fitted, equation, overall, reaction, 2, o, 3, 3, o, 2, displaystyle, ce, 2, o3, 3, o2, rate, law, observed, v, k, o, 3, 2, o, 2, displaystyle, v, frac, k, cdot, 2, it, has, been, determined, that, the, ozone, decomposition, follows, a, first, order, kinetics, and, from, the, rate, law, above, it, can, be, determined, that, the, partial, order, respect, to, molecular, oxygen, is, 1, and, respect, to, ozone, is, 2, therefore, the, global, reaction, order, is, 1, the, ozone, decomposition, consists, of, two, elementary, steps, the, first, one, corresponds, to, a, unimolecular, reaction, because, one, only, molecule, of, ozone, decomposes, into, two, products, molecular, oxygen, and, oxygen, then, the, oxygen, from, the, first, step, is, an, intermediate, because, it, participates, as, a, reactant, in, the, second, step, which, is, a, bimolecular, reaction, because, there, are, two, different, reactants, ozone, and, oxygen, that, give, rise, to, one, product, that, corresponds, to, molecular, oxygen, in, the, gas, phase, step, 1, unimolecular, reaction, o, 3, o, 2, o, displaystyle, ce, o3, o2, o, step, 2, bimolecular, reaction, o, 3, o, 2, o, 2, displaystyle, ce, o3, o, 2, o2, these, two, steps, have, different, reaction, rates, the, first, one, is, reversible, and, faster, than, the, second, reaction, which, is, slower, so, this, means, that, the, determining, step, is, the, second, reaction, and, this, is, used, to, determine, the, observed, reaction, rate, the, reaction, rate, laws, for, every, step, are, the, ones, that, follow, the, following, mechanism, allows, to, explain, the, rate, law, of, the, ozone, decomposition, observed, experimentally, and, also, it, allows, to, determine, the, reaction, orders, with, respect, to, ozone, and, oxygen, with, which, the, overall, reaction, order, will, be, determined, the, slower, step, the, bimolecular, reaction, is, the, one, that, determines, the, rate, of, product, formation, and, considering, that, this, step, gives, rise, to, two, oxygen, molecules, the, rate, law, has, this, form, however, this, equation, depends, on, the, concentration, of, oxygen, intermediate, which, can, be, determined, considering, the, first, step, since, the, first, step, is, faster, and, reversible, and, the, second, step, is, slower, the, reactants, and, products, from, the, first, step, are, in, equilibrium, so, the, concentration, of, the, intermediate, can, be, determined, as, follows, then, using, these, equations, the, formation, rate, of, molecular, oxygen, is, as, shown, below, finally, the, mechanism, presented, allows, to, establish, the, rate, observed, experimentally, with, a, rate, constant, k, obs, and, corresponding, to, a, first, order, kinetics, as, follows, where, k, obs, 2, k, 2, k, 1, k, 1, displaystyle, k, text, obs, 2k, 2, cdot, k, 1, over, k, 1, reduction, of, ozone, gives, the, ozonide, anion, o, 3, derivatives, of, this, anion, are, explosive, and, must, be, stored, at, cryogenic, temperatures, ozonides, for, all, the, alkali, metals, are, known, ko, 3, rbo, 3, and, cso, 3, can, be, prepared, from, their, respective, superoxides, although, ko3, can, be, formed, as, above, it, can, also, be, formed, from, potassium, hydroxide, and, ozone, nao, 3, and, lio, 3, must, be, prepared, by, action, of, cso, 3, in, liquid, nh, 3, on, an, ion, exchange, resin, containing, na, or, li, ions, a, solution, of, calcium, in, ammonia, reacts, with, ozone, to, give, ammonium, ozonide, and, not, calcium, ozonide, ozone, can, be, used, to, remove, iron, and, manganese, from, water, forming, a, precipitate, which, can, be, filtered, ozone, will, also, oxidize, dissolved, hydrogen, sulfide, in, water, to, sulfurous, acid, these, three, reactions, are, central, in, the, use, of, ozone, based, well, water, treatment, ozone, will, also, detoxify, cyanides, by, converting, them, to, cyanates, ozone, will, also, completely, decompose, urea, ozone, is, a, bent, triatomic, molecule, with, three, vibrational, modes, the, symmetric, stretch, 1103, 157, cm, 1, bend, 701, 42, cm, 1, and, antisymmetric, stretch, 1042, 096, cm, 1, the, symmetric, stretch, and, bend, are, weak, absorbers, but, the, antisymmetric, stretch, is, strong, and, responsible, for, ozone, being, an, important, minor, greenhouse, gas, this, ir, band, is, also, used, to, detect, ambient, and, atmospheric, ozone, although, uv, based, measurements, are, more, common, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, of, ozone, is, quite, complex, an, overview, can, be, seen, at, the, mpi, mainz, uv, vis, spectral, atlas, of, gaseous, molecules, of, atmospheric, interest, all, of, the, bands, are, dissociative, meaning, that, the, molecule, falls, apart, to, o, o, 2, after, absorbing, a, photon, the, most, important, absorption, is, the, hartley, band, extending, from, slightly, above, 300, nm, down, to, slightly, above, 200, nm, it, is, this, band, that, is, responsible, for, absorbing, uv, c, in, the, stratosphere, on, the, high, wavelength, side, the, hartley, band, transitions, to, the, so, called, huggins, band, which, falls, off, rapidly, until, disappearing, by, 360, nm, above, 400, nm, extending, well, out, into, the, nir, are, the, chappius, and, wulf, bands, there, unstructured, absorption, bands, are, useful, for, detecting, high, ambient, concentrations, of, ozone, but, are, so, weak, that, they, do, not, have, much, practical, effect, there, are, additional, absorption, bands, in, the, far, uv, which, increase, slowly, from, 200, nm, down, to, reaching, a, maximum, at, 120, nm, the, standard, way, to, express, total, ozone, levels, the, amount, of, ozone, in, a, given, vertical, column, in, the, atmosphere, is, by, using, dobson, units, point, measurements, are, reported, as, mole, fractions, in, nmol, mol, parts, per, billion, ppb, or, as, concentrations, in, g, m, 3, the, study, of, ozone, concentration, in, the, atmosphere, started, in, the, 1920s, the, highest, levels, of, ozone, in, the, atmosphere, are, in, the, stratosphere, in, a, region, also, known, as, the, ozone, layer, between, about, 10, and, 50, km, above, the, surface, or, between, about, 6, and, 31, miles, however, even, in, this, layer, the, ozone, concentrations, are, only, two, to, eight, parts, per, million, so, most, of, the, oxygen, there, is, dioxygen, o, 2, at, about, 210, 000, parts, per, million, by, volume, ozone, in, the, stratosphere, is, mostly, produced, from, short, wave, ultraviolet, rays, between, 240, and, 160, nm, oxygen, starts, to, absorb, weakly, at, 240, nm, in, the, herzberg, bands, but, most, of, the, oxygen, is, dissociated, by, absorption, in, the, strong, schumann, runge, bands, between, 200, and, 160, nm, where, ozone, does, not, absorb, while, shorter, wavelength, light, extending, to, even, the, x, ray, limit, is, energetic, enough, to, dissociate, molecular, oxygen, there, is, relatively, little, of, it, and, the, strong, solar, emission, at, lyman, alpha, 121, nm, falls, at, a, point, where, molecular, oxygen, absorption, is, a, minimum, the, process, of, ozone, creation, and, destruction, is, called, the, chapman, cycle, and, starts, with, the, photolysis, of, molecular, oxygen, followed, by, reaction, of, the, oxygen, atom, with, another, molecule, of, oxygen, to, form, ozone, where, m, denotes, the, third, body, that, carries, off, the, excess, energy, of, the, reaction, the, ozone, molecule, can, then, absorb, a, uv, c, photon, and, dissociate, the, excess, kinetic, energy, heats, the, stratosphere, when, the, o, atoms, and, the, molecular, oxygen, fly, apart, and, collide, with, other, molecules, this, conversion, of, uv, light, into, kinetic, energy, warms, the, stratosphere, the, oxygen, atoms, produced, in, the, photolysis, of, ozone, then, react, back, with, other, oxygen, molecule, as, in, the, previous, step, to, form, more, ozone, in, the, clear, atmosphere, with, only, nitrogen, and, oxygen, ozone, can, react, with, the, atomic, oxygen, to, form, two, molecules, of, o, 2, an, estimate, of, the, rate, of, this, termination, step, to, the, cycling, of, atomic, oxygen, back, to, ozone, can, be, found, simply, by, taking, the, ratios, of, the, concentration, of, o, 2, to, o, 3, the, termination, reaction, is, catalysed, by, the, presence, of, certain, free, radicals, of, which, the, most, important, are, hydroxyl, oh, nitric, oxide, no, and, atomic, chlorine, cl, and, bromine, br, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, the, amount, of, ozone, in, the, stratosphere, was, discovered, to, be, declining, mostly, because, of, increasing, concentrations, of, chlorofluorocarbons, cfc, and, similar, chlorinated, and, brominated, organic, molecules, the, concern, over, the, health, effects, of, the, decline, led, to, the, 1987, montreal, protocol, the, ban, on, the, production, of, many, ozone, depleting, chemicals, and, in, the, first, and, second, decade, of, the, 21st, century, the, beginning, of, the, recovery, of, stratospheric, ozone, concentrations, ozone, in, the, ozone, layer, filters, out, sunlight, wavelengths, from, about, 200, nm, uv, rays, to, 315, nm, with, ozone, peak, absorption, at, about, 250, nm, this, ozone, uv, absorption, is, important, to, life, since, it, extends, the, absorption, of, uv, by, ordinary, oxygen, and, nitrogen, in, air, which, absorb, all, wavelengths, 200, nm, through, the, lower, uv, c, 200, 280, nm, and, the, entire, uv, b, band, 280, 315, nm, the, small, unabsorbed, part, that, remains, of, uv, b, after, passage, through, ozone, causes, sunburn, in, humans, and, direct, dna, damage, in, living, tissues, in, both, plants, and, animals, ozone, s, effect, on, mid, range, uv, b, rays, is, illustrated, by, its, effect, on, uv, b, at, 290, nm, which, has, a, radiation, intensity, 350, million, times, as, powerful, at, the, top, of, the, atmosphere, as, at, the, surface, nevertheless, enough, of, uv, b, radiation, at, similar, frequency, reaches, the, ground, to, cause, some, sunburn, and, these, same, wavelengths, are, also, among, those, responsible, for, the, production, of, vitamin, d, in, humans, the, ozone, layer, has, little, effect, on, the, longer, uv, wavelengths, called, uv, a, 315, 400, nm, but, this, radiation, does, not, cause, sunburn, or, direct, dna, damage, while, uv, a, probably, does, cause, long, term, skin, damage, in, certain, humans, it, is, not, as, dangerous, to, plants, and, to, the, health, of, surface, dwelling, organisms, on, earth, in, general, see, ultraviolet, for, more, information, on, near, ultraviolet, low, level, ozone, or, tropospheric, ozone, is, an, atmospheric, pollutant, it, is, not, emitted, directly, by, car, engines, or, by, industrial, operations, but, formed, by, the, reaction, of, sunlight, on, air, containing, hydrocarbons, and, nitrogen, oxides, that, react, to, form, ozone, directly, at, the, source, of, the, pollution, or, many, kilometers, downwind, ozone, reacts, directly, with, some, hydrocarbons, such, as, aldehydes, and, thus, begins, their, removal, from, the, air, but, the, products, are, themselves, key, components, of, smog, ozone, photolysis, by, uv, light, leads, to, production, of, the, hydroxyl, radical, ho, and, this, plays, a, part, in, the, removal, of, hydrocarbons, from, the, air, but, is, also, the, first, step, in, the, creation, of, components, of, smog, such, as, peroxyacyl, nitrates, which, can, be, powerful, eye, irritants, the, atmospheric, lifetime, of, tropospheric, ozone, is, about, 22, days, its, main, removal, mechanisms, are, being, deposited, to, the, ground, the, above, mentioned, reaction, giving, ho, and, by, reactions, with, oh, and, the, peroxy, radical, ho, 2, there, is, evidence, of, significant, reduction, in, agricultural, yields, because, of, increased, ground, level, ozone, and, pollution, which, interferes, with, photosynthesis, and, stunts, overall, growth, of, some, plant, species, the, united, states, environmental, protection, agency, epa, has, proposed, a, secondary, regulation, to, reduce, crop, damage, in, addition, to, the, primary, regulation, designed, for, the, protection, of, human, health, certain, examples, of, cities, with, elevated, ozone, readings, are, denver, colorado, houston, texas, and, mexico, city, mexico, houston, has, a, reading, of, around, 41, nmol, mol, while, mexico, city, is, far, more, hazardous, with, a, reading, of, about, 125, nmol, mol, low, level, ozone, or, tropospheric, ozone, is, the, most, concerning, type, of, ozone, pollution, in, urban, areas, and, is, increasing, in, general, ozone, pollution, in, urban, areas, affects, denser, populations, and, is, worsened, by, high, populations, of, vehicles, which, emit, pollutants, no, 2, and, vocs, the, main, contributors, to, problematic, ozone, levels, ozone, pollution, in, urban, areas, is, especially, concerning, with, increasing, temperatures, raising, heat, related, mortality, during, heat, waves, during, heat, waves, in, urban, areas, ground, level, ozone, pollution, can, be, 20, higher, than, usual, ozone, pollution, in, urban, areas, reaches, higher, levels, of, exceedance, in, the, summer, and, autumn, which, may, be, explained, by, weather, patterns, and, traffic, patterns, people, experiencing, poverty, are, more, affected, by, pollution, in, general, even, though, these, populations, are, less, likely, to, be, contributing, to, pollution, levels, as, mentioned, above, denver, colorado, is, one, of, the, many, cities, in, the, u, s, that, have, high, amounts, of, ozone, according, to, the, american, lung, association, the, denver, aurora, area, is, the, 14th, most, ozone, polluted, area, in, the, u, s, the, problem, of, high, ozone, levels, is, not, new, to, this, area, in, 2004, the, epa, allotted, the, denver, metro, north, front, range, as, non, attainment, areas, per, 1997, s, 8, hour, ozone, standard, but, later, deferred, this, status, until, 2007, the, non, attainment, standard, indicates, that, an, area, does, not, meet, the, epa, s, air, quality, standards, the, colorado, ozone, action, plan, was, created, in, response, and, numerous, changes, were, implemented, from, this, plan, the, first, major, change, was, that, car, emission, testing, was, expanded, across, the, state, to, more, counties, that, did, not, previously, mandate, emissions, testing, like, areas, of, larimer, and, weld, county, there, have, also, been, changes, made, to, decrease, nitrogen, oxides, nox, and, volatile, organic, compound, voc, emissions, which, should, help, lower, ozone, levels, one, large, contributor, to, high, ozone, levels, in, the, area, is, the, oil, and, natural, gas, industry, situated, in, the, denver, julesburg, basin, djb, which, overlaps, with, a, majority, of, colorado, s, metropolitan, areas, ozone, is, created, naturally, in, the, earth, s, stratosphere, but, is, also, created, in, the, troposphere, from, human, efforts, briefly, mentioned, above, nox, and, vocs, react, with, sunlight, to, create, ozone, through, a, process, called, photochemistry, one, hour, elevated, ozone, events, 75, ppb, occur, during, june, august, indicating, that, elevated, ozone, levels, are, driven, by, regional, photochemistry, according, to, an, article, from, the, university, of, colorado, boulder, oil, and, natural, gas, voc, emission, have, a, major, role, in, ozone, production, and, bear, the, potential, to, contribute, to, elevated, o, 3, levels, in, the, northern, colorado, front, range, ncfr, using, complex, analyses, to, research, wind, patterns, and, emissions, from, large, oil, and, natural, gas, operations, the, authors, concluded, that, elevated, o, 3, levels, in, the, ncfr, are, predominantly, correlated, with, air, transport, from, n, ese, which, are, the, upwind, sectors, where, the, o, ng, operations, in, the, wattenberg, field, area, of, the, djb, are, located, contained, in, the, colorado, ozone, action, plan, created, in, 2008, plans, exist, to, evaluate, emission, controls, for, large, industrial, sources, of, nox, and, statewide, control, requirements, for, new, oil, and, gas, condensate, tanks, and, pneumatic, valves, in, 2011, the, regional, haze, plan, was, released, that, included, a, more, specific, plan, to, help, decrease, nox, emissions, these, efforts, are, increasingly, difficult, to, implement, and, take, many, years, to, come, to, pass, of, course, there, are, also, other, reasons, that, ozone, levels, remain, high, these, include, a, growing, population, meaning, more, car, emissions, and, the, mountains, along, the, ncfr, that, can, trap, emissions, if, interested, daily, air, quality, readings, can, be, found, at, the, colorado, department, of, public, health, and, environment, s, website, as, noted, earlier, denver, continues, to, experience, high, levels, of, ozone, to, this, day, it, will, take, many, years, and, a, systems, thinking, approach, to, combat, this, issue, of, high, ozone, levels, in, the, front, range, of, colorado, ozone, gas, attacks, any, polymer, possessing, olefinic, or, double, bonds, within, its, chain, structure, such, as, natural, rubber, nitrile, rubber, and, styrene, butadiene, rubber, products, made, using, these, polymers, are, especially, susceptible, to, attack, which, causes, cracks, to, grow, longer, and, deeper, with, time, the, rate, of, crack, growth, depending, on, the, load, carried, by, the, rubber, component, and, the, concentration, of, ozone, in, the, atmosphere, such, materials, can, be, protected, by, adding, antiozonants, such, as, waxes, which, bond, to, the, surface, to, create, a, protective, film, or, blend, with, the, material, and, provide, long, term, protection, ozone, cracking, used, to, be, a, serious, problem, in, car, tires, for, example, but, it, is, not, an, issue, with, modern, tires, on, the, other, hand, many, critical, products, like, gaskets, and, o, rings, may, be, attacked, by, ozone, produced, within, compressed, air, systems, fuel, lines, made, of, reinforced, rubber, are, also, susceptible, to, attack, especially, within, the, engine, compartment, where, some, ozone, is, produced, by, electrical, components, storing, rubber, products, in, close, proximity, to, a, dc, electric, motor, can, accelerate, ozone, cracking, the, commutator, of, the, motor, generates, sparks, which, in, turn, produce, ozone, although, ozone, was, present, at, ground, level, before, the, industrial, revolution, peak, concentrations, are, now, far, higher, than, the, pre, industrial, levels, and, even, background, concentrations, well, away, from, sources, of, pollution, are, substantially, higher, ozone, acts, as, a, greenhouse, gas, absorbing, some, of, the, infrared, energy, emitted, by, the, earth, quantifying, the, greenhouse, gas, potency, of, ozone, is, difficult, because, it, is, not, present, in, uniform, concentrations, across, the, globe, however, the, most, widely, accepted, scientific, assessments, relating, to, climate, change, e, g, the, intergovernmental, panel, on, climate, change, third, assessment, report, suggest, that, the, radiative, forcing, of, tropospheric, ozone, is, about, 25, that, of, carbon, dioxide, the, annual, global, warming, potential, of, tropospheric, ozone, is, between, 918, and, 1022, tons, carbon, dioxide, equivalent, tons, tropospheric, ozone, this, means, on, a, per, molecule, basis, ozone, in, the, troposphere, has, a, radiative, forcing, effect, roughly, 1, 000, times, as, strong, as, carbon, dioxide, however, tropospheric, ozone, is, a, short, lived, greenhouse, gas, which, decays, in, the, atmosphere, much, more, quickly, than, carbon, dioxide, this, means, that, over, a, 20, year, span, the, global, warming, potential, of, tropospheric, ozone, is, much, less, roughly, 62, to, 69, tons, carbon, dioxide, equivalent, ton, tropospheric, ozone, because, of, its, short, lived, nature, tropospheric, ozone, does, not, have, strong, global, effects, but, has, very, strong, radiative, forcing, effects, on, regional, scales, in, fact, there, are, regions, of, the, world, where, tropospheric, ozone, has, a, radiative, forcing, up, to, 150, of, carbon, dioxide, for, example, ozone, increase, in, the, troposphere, is, shown, to, be, responsible, for, 30, of, upper, southern, ocean, interior, warming, between, 1955, and, 2000, for, the, last, few, decades, scientists, studied, the, effects, of, acute, and, chronic, ozone, exposure, on, human, health, hundreds, of, studies, suggest, that, ozone, is, harmful, to, people, at, levels, currently, found, in, urban, areas, ozone, has, been, shown, to, affect, the, respiratory, cardiovascular, and, central, nervous, system, early, death, and, problems, in, reproductive, health, and, development, are, also, shown, to, be, associated, with, ozone, exposure, the, american, lung, association, has, identified, five, populations, who, are, especially, vulnerable, to, the, effects, of, breathing, ozone, additional, evidence, suggests, that, women, those, with, obesity, and, low, income, populations, may, also, face, higher, risk, from, ozone, although, more, research, is, needed, acute, ozone, exposure, ranges, from, hours, to, a, few, days, because, ozone, is, a, gas, it, directly, affects, the, lungs, and, the, entire, respiratory, system, inhaled, ozone, causes, inflammation, and, acute, but, reversible, changes, in, lung, function, as, well, as, airway, hyperresponsiveness, these, changes, lead, to, shortness, of, breath, wheezing, and, coughing, which, may, exacerbate, lung, diseases, like, asthma, or, chronic, obstructive, pulmonary, disease, copd, resulting, in, the, need, to, receive, medical, treatment, acute, and, chronic, exposure, to, ozone, has, been, shown, to, cause, an, increased, risk, of, respiratory, infections, due, to, the, following, mechanism, multiple, studies, have, been, conducted, to, determine, the, mechanism, behind, ozone, s, harmful, effects, particularly, in, the, lungs, these, studies, have, shown, that, exposure, to, ozone, causes, changes, in, the, immune, response, within, the, lung, tissue, resulting, in, disruption, of, both, the, innate, and, adaptive, immune, response, as, well, as, altering, the, protective, function, of, lung, epithelial, cells, it, is, thought, that, these, changes, in, immune, response, and, the, related, inflammatory, response, are, factors, that, likely, contribute, to, the, increased, risk, of, lung, infections, and, worsening, or, triggering, of, asthma, and, reactive, airways, after, exposure, to, ground, level, ozone, pollution, the, innate, cellular, immune, system, consists, of, various, chemical, signals, and, cell, types, that, work, broadly, and, against, multiple, pathogen, types, typically, bacteria, or, foreign, bodies, substances, in, the, host, the, cells, of, the, innate, system, include, phagocytes, neutrophils, both, thought, to, contribute, to, the, mechanism, of, ozone, pathology, in, the, lungs, as, the, functioning, of, these, cell, types, have, been, shown, to, change, after, exposure, to, ozone, macrophages, cells, that, serve, the, purpose, of, eliminating, pathogens, or, foreign, material, through, the, process, of, phagocytosis, have, been, shown, to, change, the, level, of, inflammatory, signals, they, release, in, response, to, ozone, either, up, regulating, and, resulting, in, an, inflammatory, response, in, the, lung, or, down, regulating, and, reducing, immune, protection, neutrophils, another, important, cell, type, of, the, innate, immune, system, that, primarily, targets, bacterial, pathogens, are, found, to, be, present, in, the, airways, within, 6, hours, of, exposure, to, high, ozone, levels, despite, high, levels, in, the, lung, tissues, however, their, ability, to, clear, bacteria, appears, impaired, by, exposure, to, ozone, the, adaptive, immune, system, is, the, branch, of, immunity, that, provides, long, term, protection, via, the, development, of, antibodies, targeting, specific, pathogens, and, is, also, impacted, by, high, ozone, exposure, lymphocytes, a, cellular, component, of, the, adaptive, immune, response, produce, an, increased, amount, of, inflammatory, chemicals, called, cytokines, after, exposure, to, ozone, which, may, contribute, to, airway, hyperreactivity, and, worsening, asthma, symptoms, the, airway, epithelial, cells, also, play, an, important, role, in, protecting, individuals, from, pathogens, in, normal, tissue, the, epithelial, layer, forms, a, protective, barrier, and, also, contains, specialized, ciliary, structures, that, work, to, clear, foreign, bodies, mucus, and, pathogens, from, the, lungs, when, exposed, to, ozone, the, cilia, become, damaged, and, mucociliary, clearance, of, pathogens, is, reduced, furthermore, the, epithelial, barrier, becomes, weakened, allowing, pathogens, to, cross, the, barrier, proliferate, and, spread, into, deeper, tissues, together, these, changes, in, the, epithelial, barrier, help, make, individuals, more, susceptible, to, pulmonary, infections, inhaling, ozone, not, only, affects, the, immune, system, and, lungs, but, it, may, also, affect, the, heart, as, well, ozone, causes, short, term, autonomic, imbalance, leading, to, changes, in, heart, rate, and, reduction, in, heart, rate, variability, and, high, levels, exposure, for, as, little, as, one, hour, results, in, a, supraventricular, arrhythmia, in, the, elderly, both, increase, the, risk, of, premature, death, and, stroke, ozone, may, also, lead, to, vasoconstriction, resulting, in, increased, systemic, arterial, pressure, contributing, to, increased, risk, of, cardiac, morbidity, and, mortality, in, patients, with, pre, existing, cardiac, diseases, breathing, ozone, for, periods, longer, than, eight, hours, at, a, time, for, weeks, months, or, years, defines, chronic, exposure, numerous, studies, suggest, a, serious, impact, on, the, health, of, various, populations, from, this, exposure, one, study, finds, significant, positive, associations, between, chronic, ozone, and, all, cause, circulatory, and, respiratory, mortality, with, 2, 3, and, 12, increases, in, risk, per, 10, ppb, and, report, an, association, 95, ci, of, annual, ozone, and, all, cause, mortality, with, a, hazard, ratio, of, 1, 02, 1, 01, 1, 04, and, with, cardiovascular, mortality, of, 1, 03, 1, 01, 1, 05, a, similar, study, finds, similar, associations, with, all, cause, mortality, and, even, larger, effects, for, cardiovascular, mortality, an, increased, risk, of, mortality, from, respiratory, causes, is, associated, with, long, term, chronic, exposure, to, ozone, chronic, ozone, has, detrimental, effects, on, children, especially, those, with, asthma, the, risk, for, hospitalization, in, children, with, asthma, increases, with, chronic, exposure, to, ozone, younger, children, and, those, with, low, income, status, are, even, at, greater, risk, adults, suffering, from, respiratory, diseases, asthma, copd, lung, cancer, are, at, a, higher, risk, of, mortality, and, morbidity, and, critically, ill, patients, have, an, increased, risk, of, developing, acute, respiratory, distress, syndrome, with, chronic, ozone, exposure, as, well, ozone, generators, sold, as, air, cleaners, intentionally, produce, the, gas, ozone, these, are, often, marketed, to, control, indoor, air, pollution, and, use, misleading, terms, to, describe, ozone, some, examples, are, describing, it, as, energized, oxygen, or, pure, air, suggesting, that, ozone, is, a, healthy, or, better, kind, of, oxygen, however, according, to, the, epa, there, is, evidence, to, show, that, at, concentrations, that, do, not, exceed, public, health, standards, ozone, is, not, effective, at, removing, many, odor, causing, chemicals, and, if, used, at, concentrations, that, do, not, exceed, public, health, standards, ozone, applied, to, indoor, air, does, not, effectively, remove, viruses, bacteria, mold, or, other, biological, pollutants, furthermore, another, report, states, that, results, of, some, controlled, studies, show, that, concentrations, of, ozone, considerably, higher, than, these, standards, are, possible, even, when, a, user, follows, the, manufacturer, s, operating, instructions, the, california, air, resources, board, has, a, page, listing, air, cleaners, many, with, ionizers, meeting, their, indoor, ozone, limit, of, 0, 050, parts, per, million, from, that, article, all, portable, indoor, air, cleaning, devices, sold, in, california, must, be, certified, by, the, california, air, resources, board, carb, to, be, certified, air, cleaners, must, be, tested, for, electrical, safety, and, ozone, emissions, and, meet, an, ozone, emission, concentration, limit, of, 0, 050, parts, per, million, for, more, information, about, the, regulation, visit, the, air, cleaner, regulation, ozone, precursors, are, a, group, of, pollutants, predominantly, those, emitted, during, the, combustion, of, fossil, fuels, ground, level, ozone, pollution, tropospheric, ozone, is, created, near, the, earth, s, surface, by, the, action, of, daylight, uv, rays, on, these, precursors, the, ozone, at, ground, level, is, primarily, from, fossil, fuel, precursors, but, methane, is, a, natural, precursor, and, the, very, low, natural, background, level, of, ozone, at, ground, level, is, considered, safe, this, section, examines, the, health, impacts, of, fossil, fuel, burning, which, raises, ground, level, ozone, far, above, background, levels, there, is, a, great, deal, of, evidence, to, show, that, ground, level, ozone, can, harm, lung, function, and, irritate, the, respiratory, system, exposure, to, ozone, and, the, pollutants, that, produce, it, is, linked, to, premature, death, asthma, bronchitis, heart, attack, and, other, cardiopulmonary, problems, long, term, exposure, to, ozone, has, been, shown, to, increase, risk, of, death, from, respiratory, illness, a, study, of, 450, 000, people, living, in, u, s, cities, saw, a, significant, correlation, between, ozone, levels, and, respiratory, illness, over, the, 18, year, follow, up, period, the, study, revealed, that, people, living, in, cities, with, high, ozone, levels, such, as, houston, or, los, angeles, had, an, over, 30, increased, risk, of, dying, from, lung, disease, air, quality, guidelines, such, as, those, from, the, world, health, organization, the, u, s, environmental, protection, agency, epa, and, the, european, union, are, based, on, detailed, studies, designed, to, identify, the, levels, that, can, cause, measurable, ill, health, effects, according, to, scientists, with, the, epa, susceptible, people, can, be, adversely, affected, by, ozone, levels, as, low, as, 40, nmol, mol, in, the, eu, the, current, target, value, for, ozone, concentrations, is, 120, g, m, 3, which, is, about, 60, nmol, mol, this, target, applies, to, all, member, states, in, accordance, with, directive, 2008, 50, ec, ozone, concentration, is, measured, as, a, maximum, daily, mean, of, 8, hour, averages, and, the, target, should, not, be, exceeded, on, more, than, 25, calendar, days, per, year, starting, from, january, 2010, whilst, the, directive, requires, in, the, future, a, strict, compliance, with, 120, g, m, 3, limit, i, e, mean, ozone, concentration, not, to, be, exceeded, on, any, day, of, the, year, there, is, no, date, set, for, this, requirement, and, this, is, treated, as, a, long, term, objective, in, the, us, the, clean, air, act, directs, the, epa, to, set, national, ambient, air, quality, standards, for, several, pollutants, including, ground, level, ozone, and, counties, out, of, compliance, with, these, standards, are, required, to, take, steps, to, reduce, their, levels, in, may, 2008, under, a, court, order, the, epa, lowered, its, ozone, standard, from, 80, nmol, mol, to, 75, nmol, mol, the, move, proved, controversial, since, the, agency, s, own, scientists, and, advisory, board, had, recommended, lowering, the, standard, to, 60, nmol, mol, many, public, health, and, environmental, groups, also, supported, the, 60, nmol, mol, standard, and, the, world, health, organization, recommends, 100, g, m, 3, 51, nmol, mol, on, january, 7, 2010, the, u, s, environmental, protection, agency, epa, announced, proposed, revisions, to, the, national, ambient, air, quality, standard, naaqs, for, the, pollutant, ozone, the, principal, component, of, smog, epa, proposes, that, the, level, of, the, 8, hour, primary, standard, which, was, set, at, 0, 075, mol, mol, in, the, 2008, final, rule, should, instead, be, set, at, a, lower, level, within, the, range, of, 0, 060, to, 0, 070, mol, mol, to, provide, increased, protection, for, children, and, other, at, risk, populations, against, an, array, of, o, 3, related, adverse, health, effects, that, range, from, decreased, lung, function, and, increased, respiratory, symptoms, to, serious, indicators, of, respiratory, morbidity, including, emergency, department, visits, and, hospital, admissions, for, respiratory, causes, and, possibly, cardiovascular, related, morbidity, as, well, as, total, non, accidental, and, cardiopulmonary, mortality, on, october, 26, 2015, the, epa, published, a, final, rule, with, an, effective, date, of, december, 28, 2015, that, revised, the, 8, hour, primary, naaqs, from, 0, 075, ppm, to, 0, 070, ppm, the, epa, has, developed, an, air, quality, index, aqi, to, help, explain, air, pollution, levels, to, the, general, public, under, the, current, standards, eight, hour, average, ozone, mole, fractions, of, 85, to, 104, nmol, mol, are, described, as, unhealthy, for, sensitive, groups, 105, nmol, mol, to, 124, nmol, mol, as, unhealthy, and, 125, nmol, mol, to, 404, nmol, mol, as, very, unhealthy, ozone, can, also, be, present, in, indoor, air, pollution, partly, as, a, result, of, electronic, equipment, such, as, photocopiers, a, connection, has, also, been, known, to, exist, between, the, increased, pollen, fungal, spores, and, ozone, caused, by, thunderstorms, and, hospital, admissions, of, asthma, sufferers, in, the, victorian, era, one, british, folk, myth, held, that, the, smell, of, the, sea, was, caused, by, ozone, in, fact, the, characteristic, smell, of, the, sea, is, caused, by, dimethyl, sulfide, a, chemical, generated, by, phytoplankton, victorian, britons, considered, the, resulting, smell, bracing, an, investigation, to, assess, the, joint, mortality, effects, of, ozone, and, heat, during, the, european, heat, waves, in, 2003, concluded, that, these, appear, to, be, additive, ozone, along, with, reactive, forms, of, oxygen, such, as, superoxide, singlet, oxygen, hydrogen, peroxide, and, hypochlorite, ions, is, produced, by, white, blood, cells, and, other, biological, systems, such, as, the, roots, of, marigolds, as, a, means, of, destroying, foreign, bodies, ozone, reacts, directly, with, organic, double, bonds, also, when, ozone, breaks, down, to, dioxygen, it, gives, rise, to, oxygen, free, radicals, which, are, highly, reactive, and, capable, of, damaging, many, organic, molecules, moreover, it, is, believed, that, the, powerful, oxidizing, properties, of, ozone, may, be, a, contributing, factor, of, inflammation, the, cause, and, effect, relationship, of, how, the, ozone, is, created, in, the, body, and, what, it, does, is, still, under, consideration, and, still, subject, to, various, interpretations, since, other, body, chemical, processes, can, trigger, some, of, the, same, reactions, there, is, evidence, linking, the, antibody, catalyzed, water, oxidation, pathway, of, the, human, immune, response, to, the, production, of, ozone, in, this, system, ozone, is, produced, by, antibody, catalyzed, production, of, trioxidane, from, water, and, neutrophil, produced, singlet, oxygen, when, inhaled, ozone, reacts, with, compounds, lining, the, lungs, to, form, specific, cholesterol, derived, metabolites, that, are, thought, to, facilitate, the, build, up, and, pathogenesis, of, atherosclerotic, plaques, a, form, of, heart, disease, these, metabolites, have, been, confirmed, as, naturally, occurring, in, human, atherosclerotic, arteries,

to, 30, dissolved, ozone, concentrations, in, output, water, temperature, and, humidity, play, a, large, role, in, how, much, ozone, is, being, produced, using, traditional, generation, methods, such, as, corona, discharge, and, ultraviolet, light, old, generation, methods, will, produce, less, than, 50, of, nominal, capacity, if, operated, with, humid, ambient, air, as, opposed, to, very, dry, air, new, generators, using, electrolytic, methods, can, achieve, higher, purity, and, dissolution, through, using, water, molecules, as, the, source, of, ozone, production, this, is, the, most, common, type, of, ozone, generator, for, most, industrial, and, personal, uses, while, variations, of, the, hot, spark, coronal, discharge, method, of, ozone, production, exist, including, medical, grade, and, industrial, grade, ozone, generators, these, units, usually, work, by, means, of, a, corona, discharge, tube, or, ozone, plate, they, are, typically, cost, effective, and, do, not, require, an, oxygen, source, other, than, the, ambient, air, to, produce, ozone, concentrations, of, 3, 6, fluctuations, in, ambient, air, due, to, weather, or, other, environmental, conditions, cause, variability, in, ozone, production, however, they, also, produce, nitrogen, oxides, as, a, by, product, use, of, an, air, dryer, can, reduce, or, eliminate, nitric, acid, formation, by, removing, water, vapor, and, increase, ozone, production, at, room, temperature, nitric, acid, will, form, into, a, vapour, that, is, hazardous, if, inhaled, symptoms, can, include, chest, pain, shortness, of, breath, headaches, and, a, dry, nose, and, throat, causing, a, burning, sensation, use, of, an, oxygen, concentrator, can, further, increase, the, ozone, production, and, further, reduce, the, risk, of, nitric, acid, formation, by, removing, not, only, the, water, vapor, but, also, the, bulk, of, the, nitrogen, uv, ozone, generators, or, vacuum, ultraviolet, vuv, ozone, generators, employ, a, light, source, that, generates, a, narrow, band, ultraviolet, light, a, subset, of, that, produced, by, the, sun, the, sun, s, uv, sustains, the, ozone, layer, in, the, stratosphere, of, earth, uv, ozone, generators, use, ambient, air, for, ozone, production, no, air, prep, systems, are, used, air, dryer, or, oxygen, concentrator, therefore, these, generators, tend, to, be, less, expensive, however, uv, ozone, generators, usually, produce, ozone, with, a, concentration, of, about, 0, 5, or, lower, which, limits, the, potential, ozone, production, rate, another, disadvantage, of, this, method, is, that, it, requires, the, ambient, air, oxygen, to, be, exposed, to, the, uv, source, for, a, longer, amount, of, time, and, any, gas, that, is, not, exposed, to, the, uv, source, will, not, be, treated, this, makes, uv, generators, impractical, for, use, in, situations, that, deal, with, rapidly, moving, air, or, water, streams, in, duct, air, sterilization, for, example, production, of, ozone, is, one, of, the, potential, dangers, of, ultraviolet, germicidal, irradiation, vuv, ozone, generators, are, used, in, swimming, pools, and, spa, applications, ranging, to, millions, of, gallons, of, water, vuv, ozone, generators, unlike, corona, discharge, generators, do, not, produce, harmful, nitrogen, by, products, and, also, unlike, corona, discharge, systems, vuv, ozone, generators, work, extremely, well, in, humid, air, environments, there, is, also, not, normally, a, need, for, expensive, off, gas, mechanisms, and, no, need, for, air, driers, or, oxygen, concentrators, which, require, extra, costs, and, maintenance, in, the, cold, plasma, method, pure, oxygen, gas, is, exposed, to, a, plasma, created, by, dbd, the, diatomic, oxygen, is, split, into, single, atoms, which, then, recombine, in, triplets, to, form, ozone, it, is, common, in, the, industry, to, mislabel, some, dbd, ozone, generators, as, cd, corona, discharge, generators, typically, all, solid, flat, metal, electrode, ozone, generators, produce, ozone, using, the, dielectric, barrier, discharge, method, cold, plasma, machines, use, pure, oxygen, as, the, input, source, and, produce, a, maximum, concentration, of, about, 24, ozone, they, produce, far, greater, quantities, of, ozone, in, a, given, time, compared, to, ultraviolet, production, that, has, about, 2, efficiency, the, discharges, manifest, as, filamentary, transfer, of, electrons, micro, discharges, in, a, gap, between, two, electrodes, in, order, to, evenly, distribute, the, micro, discharges, a, dielectric, insulator, must, be, used, to, separate, the, metallic, electrodes, and, to, prevent, arcing, electrolytic, ozone, generation, eog, splits, water, molecules, into, h, 2, o, 2, and, o, 3, in, most, eog, methods, the, hydrogen, gas, will, be, removed, to, leave, oxygen, and, ozone, as, the, only, reaction, products, therefore, eog, can, achieve, higher, dissolution, in, water, without, other, competing, gases, found, in, corona, discharge, method, such, as, nitrogen, gases, present, in, ambient, air, this, method, of, generation, can, achieve, concentrations, of, 20, 30, and, is, independent, of, air, quality, because, water, is, used, as, the, source, material, production, of, ozone, electrolytically, is, typically, unfavorable, because, of, the, high, overpotential, required, to, produce, ozone, as, compared, to, oxygen, this, is, why, ozone, is, not, produced, during, typical, water, electrolysis, however, it, is, possible, to, increase, the, overpotential, of, oxygen, by, careful, catalyst, selection, such, that, ozone, is, preferentially, produced, under, electrolysis, catalysts, typically, chosen, for, this, approach, are, lead, dioxide, or, boron, doped, diamond, the, ozone, to, oxygen, ratio, is, improved, by, increasing, current, density, at, the, anode, cooling, the, electrolyte, around, the, anode, close, to, 0, c, using, an, acidic, electrolyte, such, as, dilute, sulfuric, acid, instead, of, a, basic, solution, and, by, applying, pulsed, current, instead, of, dc, ozone, cannot, be, stored, and, transported, like, other, industrial, gases, because, it, quickly, decays, into, diatomic, oxygen, and, must, therefore, be, produced, on, site, available, ozone, generators, vary, in, the, arrangement, and, design, of, the, high, voltage, electrodes, at, production, capacities, higher, than, 20, kg, per, hour, a, gas, water, tube, heat, exchanger, may, be, utilized, as, ground, electrode, and, assembled, with, tubular, high, voltage, electrodes, on, the, gas, side, the, regime, of, typical, gas, pressures, is, around, 2, bars, 200, kpa, absolute, in, oxygen, and, 3, bars, 300, kpa, absolute, in, air, several, megawatts, of, electrical, power, may, be, installed, in, large, facilities, applied, as, single, phase, ac, current, at, 50, to, 8000, hz, and, peak, voltages, between, 3, 000, and, 20, 000, volts, applied, voltage, is, usually, inversely, related, to, the, applied, frequency, the, dominating, parameter, influencing, ozone, generation, efficiency, is, the, gas, temperature, which, is, controlled, by, cooling, water, temperature, and, or, gas, velocity, the, cooler, the, water, the, better, the, ozone, synthesis, the, lower, the, gas, velocity, the, higher, the, concentration, but, the, lower, the, net, ozone, produced, at, typical, industrial, conditions, almost, 90, of, the, effective, power, is, dissipated, as, heat, and, needs, to, be, removed, by, a, sufficient, cooling, water, flow, because, of, the, high, reactivity, of, ozone, only, a, few, materials, may, be, used, like, stainless, steel, quality, 316l, titanium, aluminium, as, long, as, no, moisture, is, present, glass, polytetrafluorethylene, or, polyvinylidene, fluoride, viton, may, be, used, with, the, restriction, of, constant, mechanical, forces, and, absence, of, humidity, humidity, limitations, apply, depending, on, the, formulation, hypalon, may, be, used, with, the, restriction, that, no, water, comes, in, contact, with, it, except, for, normal, atmospheric, levels, embrittlement, or, shrinkage, is, the, common, mode, of, failure, of, elastomers, with, exposure, to, ozone, ozone, cracking, is, the, common, mode, of, failure, of, elastomer, seals, like, o, rings, silicone, rubbers, are, usually, adequate, for, use, as, gaskets, in, ozone, concentrations, below, 1, wt, such, as, in, equipment, for, accelerated, aging, of, rubber, samples, ozone, may, be, formed, from, o, 2, by, electrical, discharges, and, by, action, of, high, energy, electromagnetic, radiation, unsuppressed, arcing, in, electrical, contacts, motor, brushes, or, mechanical, switches, breaks, down, the, chemical, bonds, of, the, atmospheric, oxygen, surrounding, the, contacts, free, radicals, of, oxygen, in, and, around, the, arc, recombine, to, create, ozone, certain, electrical, equipment, generate, significant, levels, of, ozone, this, is, especially, true, of, devices, using, high, voltages, such, as, ionic, air, purifiers, laser, printers, photocopiers, tasers, and, arc, welders, electric, motors, using, brushes, can, generate, ozone, from, repeated, sparking, inside, the, unit, large, motors, that, use, brushes, such, as, those, used, by, elevators, or, hydraulic, pumps, will, generate, more, ozone, than, smaller, motors, ozone, is, similarly, formed, in, the, catatumbo, lightning, storms, phenomenon, on, the, catatumbo, river, in, venezuela, though, ozone, s, instability, makes, it, dubious, that, it, has, any, effect, on, the, ozonosphere, it, is, the, world, s, largest, single, natural, generator, of, ozone, lending, calls, for, it, to, be, designated, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, in, the, laboratory, ozone, can, be, produced, by, electrolysis, using, a, 9, volt, battery, a, pencil, graphite, rod, cathode, a, platinum, wire, anode, and, a, 3, molar, sulfuric, acid, electrolyte, the, half, cell, reactions, taking, place, are, where, e, represents, the, standard, electrode, potential, in, the, net, reaction, three, equivalents, of, water, are, converted, into, one, equivalent, of, ozone, and, three, equivalents, of, hydrogen, oxygen, formation, is, a, competing, reaction, it, can, also, be, generated, by, a, high, voltage, arc, in, its, simplest, form, high, voltage, ac, such, as, the, output, of, a, neon, sign, transformer, is, connected, to, two, metal, rods, with, the, ends, placed, sufficiently, close, to, each, other, to, allow, an, arc, the, resulting, arc, will, convert, atmospheric, oxygen, to, ozone, it, is, often, desirable, to, contain, the, ozone, this, can, be, done, with, an, apparatus, consisting, of, two, concentric, glass, tubes, sealed, together, at, the, top, with, gas, ports, at, the, top, and, bottom, of, the, outer, tube, the, inner, core, should, have, a, length, of, metal, foil, inserted, into, it, connected, to, one, side, of, the, power, source, the, other, side, of, the, power, source, should, be, connected, to, another, piece, of, foil, wrapped, around, the, outer, tube, a, source, of, dry, o, 2, is, applied, to, the, bottom, port, when, high, voltage, is, applied, to, the, foil, leads, electricity, will, discharge, between, the, dry, dioxygen, in, the, middle, and, form, o, 3, and, o, 2, which, will, flow, out, the, top, port, this, is, called, a, siemen, s, ozoniser, the, reaction, can, be, summarized, as, follows, the, largest, use, of, ozone, is, in, the, preparation, of, pharmaceuticals, synthetic, lubricants, and, many, other, commercially, useful, organic, compounds, where, it, is, used, to, sever, carbon, carbon, bonds, it, can, also, be, used, for, bleaching, substances, and, for, killing, microorganisms, in, air, and, water, sources, many, municipal, drinking, water, systems, kill, bacteria, with, ozone, instead, of, the, more, common, chlorine, ozone, has, a, very, high, oxidation, potential, ozone, does, not, form, organochlorine, compounds, nor, does, it, remain, in, the, water, after, treatment, ozone, can, form, the, suspected, carcinogen,

operating, rooms, between, surgeries, the, rooms, are, cleaned, and, then, sealed, airtight, before, being, filled, with, ozone, which, effectively, kills, or, neutralizes, all, remaining, bacteria, ozone, is, used, as, an, alternative, to, chlorine, or, chlorine, dioxide, in, the, bleaching, of, wood, pulp, it, is, often, used, in, conjunction, with, oxygen, and, hydrogen, peroxide, to, eliminate, the, need, for, chlorine, containing, compounds, in, the, manufacture, of, high, quality, white, paper, ozone, can, be, used, to, detoxify, cyanide, wastes, for, example, from, gold, and, silver, mining, by, oxidizing, cyanide, to, cyanate, and, eventually, to, carbon, dioxide, since, the, invention, of, dielectric, barrier, discharge, dbd, plasma, reactors, it, has, been, employed, for, water, treatment, with, ozone, however, with, cheaper, alternative, disinfectants, like, chlorine, such, applications, of, dbd, ozone, water, decontamination, have, been, limited, by, high, power, consumption, and, bulky, equipment, despite, this, with, research, revealing, the, negative, impacts, of, common, disinfectants, like, chlorine, with, respect, to, toxic, residuals, and, ineffectiveness, in, killing, certain, micro, organisms, dbd, plasma, based, ozone, decontamination, is, of, interest, in, current, available, technologies, although, ozonation, of, water, with, a, high, concentration, of, bromide, does, lead, to, the, formation, of, undesirable, brominated, disinfection, byproducts, unless, drinking, water, is, produced, by, desalination, ozonation, can, generally, be, applied, without, concern, for, these, byproducts, advantages, of, ozone, include, high, thermodynamic, oxidation, potential, less, sensitivity, to, organic, material, and, better, tolerance, for, ph, variations, while, retaining, the, ability, to, kill, bacteria, fungi, viruses, as, well, as, spores, and, cysts, although, ozone, has, been, widely, accepted, in, europe, for, decades, it, is, sparingly, used, for, decontamination, in, the, u, s, due, to, limitations, of, high, power, consumption, bulky, installation, and, stigma, attached, with, ozone, toxicity,
