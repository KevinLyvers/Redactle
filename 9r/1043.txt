the, electron, e, or, in, nuclear, reactions, is, a, subatomic, particle, with, a, negative, one, elementary, electric, charge, electrons, belong, to, the, first, generation, of, the, lepton, particle, family, and, are, generally, thought, to, be, elementary, particles, because, they, have, no, known, components, or, substructure, the, electron, s, mass, is, approximately, 1, 1836, that, of, the, proton, quantum, mechanical, properties, of, the, electron, include, an, intrinsic, angular, momentum, spin, of, a, half, integer, value, expressed, in, units, of, the, reduced, planck, constant, being, fermions, no, two, electrons, can, occupy, the, same, quantum, state, per, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, like, all, elementary, particles, electrons, exhibit, properties, of, both, particles, and, waves, they, can, collide, with, other, particles, and, can, be, diffracted, like, light, the, wave, properties, of, electrons, are, easier, to, observe, with, experiments, than, those, of, other, particles, like, neutrons, and, protons, because, electrons, have, a, lower, mass, and, hence, a, longer, de, broglie, wavelength, for, a, given, energy, electrons, play, an, essential, role, in, numerous, physical, phenomena, such, as, electricity, magnetism, chemistry, and, thermal, conductivity, they, also, participate, in, gravitational, electromagnetic, and, weak, interactions, since, an, electron, has, charge, it, has, a, surrounding, electric, field, if, that, electron, is, moving, relative, to, an, observer, the, observer, will, observe, it, to, generate, a, magnetic, field, electromagnetic, fields, produced, from, other, sources, will, affect, the, motion, of, an, electron, according, to, the, lorentz, force, law, electrons, radiate, or, absorb, energy, in, the, form, of, photons, when, they, are, accelerated, laboratory, instruments, are, capable, of, trapping, individual, electrons, as, well, as, electron, plasma, by, the, use, of, electromagnetic, fields, special, telescopes, can, detect, electron, plasma, in, outer, space, electrons, are, involved, in, many, applications, such, as, tribology, or, frictional, charging, electrolysis, electrochemistry, battery, technologies, electronics, welding, cathode, ray, tubes, photoelectricity, photovoltaic, solar, panels, electron, microscopes, radiation, therapy, lasers, gaseous, ionization, detectors, and, particle, accelerators, interactions, involving, electrons, with, other, subatomic, particles, are, of, interest, in, fields, such, as, chemistry, and, nuclear, physics, the, coulomb, force, interaction, between, the, positive, protons, within, atomic, nuclei, and, the, negative, electrons, without, allows, the, composition, of, the, two, known, as, atoms, ionization, or, differences, in, the, proportions, of, negative, electrons, versus, positive, nuclei, changes, the, binding, energy, of, an, atomic, system, the, exchange, or, sharing, of, the, electrons, between, two, or, more, atoms, is, the, main, cause, of, chemical, bonding, in, 1838, british, natural, philosopher, richard, laming, first, hypothesized, the, concept, of, an, indivisible, quantity, of, electric, charge, to, explain, the, chemical, properties, of, atoms, irish, physicist, george, johnstone, stoney, named, this, charge, electron, in, 1891, and, j, j, thomson, and, his, team, of, british, physicists, identified, it, as, a, particle, in, 1897, during, the, cathode, ray, tube, experiment, electrons, participate, in, nuclear, reactions, such, as, nucleosynthesis, in, stars, where, they, are, known, as, beta, particles, electrons, can, be, created, through, beta, decay, of, radioactive, isotopes, and, in, high, energy, collisions, for, instance, when, cosmic, rays, enter, the, atmosphere, the, antiparticle, of, the, electron, is, called, the, positron, it, is, identical, to, the, electron, except, that, it, carries, electrical, charge, of, the, opposite, sign, when, an, electron, collides, with, a, positron, both, particles, can, be, annihilated, producing, gamma, ray, photons, the, ancient, greeks, noticed, that, amber, attracted, small, objects, when, rubbed, with, fur, along, with, lightning, this, phenomenon, is, one, of, humanity, s, earliest, recorded, experiences, with, electricity, in, his, 1600, treatise, de, magnete, the, english, scientist, william, gilbert, coined, the, neo, latin, term, electrica, to, refer, to, those, substances, with, property, similar, to, that, of, amber, which, attract, small, objects, after, being, rubbed, both, electric, and, electricity, are, derived, from, the, latin, lectrum, also, the, root, of, the, alloy, of, the, same, name, which, came, from, the, greek, word, for, amber, lektron, in, the, early, 1700s, french, chemist, charles, fran, ois, du, fay, found, that, if, a, charged, gold, leaf, is, repulsed, by, glass, rubbed, with, silk, then, the, same, charged, gold, leaf, is, attracted, by, amber, rubbed, with, wool, from, this, and, other, results, of, similar, types, of, experiments, du, fay, concluded, that, electricity, consists, of, two, electrical, fluids, vitreous, fluid, from, glass, rubbed, with, silk, and, resinous, fluid, from, amber, rubbed, with, wool, these, two, fluids, can, neutralize, each, other, when, combined, american, scientist, ebenezer, kinnersley, later, also, independently, reached, the, same, conclusion, 118, a, decade, later, benjamin, franklin, proposed, that, electricity, was, not, from, different, types, of, electrical, fluid, but, a, single, electrical, fluid, showing, an, excess, or, deficit, he, gave, them, the, modern, charge, nomenclature, of, positive, and, negative, respectively, franklin, thought, of, the, charge, carrier, as, being, positive, but, he, did, not, correctly, identify, which, situation, was, a, surplus, of, the, charge, carrier, and, which, situation, was, a, deficit, between, 1838, and, 1851, british, natural, philosopher, richard, laming, developed, the, idea, that, an, atom, is, composed, of, a, core, of, matter, surrounded, by, subatomic, particles, that, had, unit, electric, charges, beginning, in, 1846, german, physicist, wilhelm, eduard, weber, theorized, that, electricity, was, composed, of, positively, and, negatively, charged, fluids, and, their, interaction, was, governed, by, the, inverse, square, law, after, studying, the, phenomenon, of, electrolysis, in, 1874, irish, physicist, george, johnstone, stoney, suggested, that, there, existed, a, single, definite, quantity, of, electricity, the, charge, of, a, monovalent, ion, he, was, able, to, estimate, the, value, of, this, elementary, charge, e, by, means, of, faraday, s, laws, of, electrolysis, however, stoney, believed, these, charges, were, permanently, attached, to, atoms, and, could, not, be, removed, in, 1881, german, physicist, hermann, von, helmholtz, argued, that, both, positive, and, negative, charges, were, divided, into, elementary, parts, each, of, which, behaves, like, atoms, of, electricity, stoney, initially, coined, the, term, electrolion, in, 1881, ten, years, later, he, switched, to, electron, to, describe, these, elementary, charges, writing, in, 1894, an, estimate, was, made, of, the, actual, amount, of, this, most, remarkable, fundamental, unit, of, electricity, for, which, i, have, since, ventured, to, suggest, the, name, electron, a, 1906, proposal, to, change, to, electrion, failed, because, hendrik, lorentz, preferred, to, keep, electron, the, word, electron, is, a, combination, of, the, words, electr, ic, and, i, on, the, suffix, on, which, is, now, used, to, designate, other, subatomic, particles, such, as, a, proton, or, neutron, is, in, turn, derived, from, electron, while, studying, electrical, conductivity, in, rarefied, gases, in, 1859, the, german, physicist, julius, pl, cker, observed, the, radiation, emitted, from, the, cathode, caused, phosphorescent, light, to, appear, on, the, tube, wall, near, the, cathode, and, the, region, of, the, phosphorescent, light, could, be, moved, by, application, of, a, magnetic, field, in, 1869, pl, cker, s, student, johann, wilhelm, hittorf, found, that, a, solid, body, placed, in, between, the, cathode, and, the, phosphorescence, would, cast, a, shadow, upon, the, phosphorescent, region, of, the, tube, hittorf, inferred, that, there, are, straight, rays, emitted, from, the, cathode, and, that, the, phosphorescence, was, caused, by, the, rays, striking, the, tube, walls, in, 1876, the, german, physicist, eugen, goldstein, showed, that, the, rays, were, emitted, perpendicular, to, the, cathode, surface, which, distinguished, between, the, rays, that, were, emitted, from, the, cathode, and, the, incandescent, light, goldstein, dubbed, the, rays, cathode, rays, 393, decades, of, experimental, and, theoretical, research, involving, cathode, rays, were, important, in, j, j, thomson, s, eventual, discovery, of, electrons, during, the, 1870s, the, english, chemist, and, physicist, sir, william, crookes, developed, the, first, cathode, ray, tube, to, have, a, high, vacuum, inside, he, then, showed, in, 1874, that, the, cathode, rays, can, turn, a, small, paddle, wheel, when, placed, in, their, path, therefore, he, concluded, that, the, rays, carried, momentum, furthermore, by, applying, a, magnetic, field, he, was, able, to, deflect, the, rays, thereby, demonstrating, that, the, beam, behaved, as, though, it, were, negatively, charged, in, 1879, he, proposed, that, these, properties, could, be, explained, by, regarding, cathode, rays, as, composed, of, negatively, charged, gaseous, molecules, in, a, fourth, state, of, matter, in, which, the, mean, free, path, of, the, particles, is, so, long, that, collisions, may, be, ignored, 394, 395, the, german, born, british, physicist, arthur, schuster, expanded, upon, crookes, s, experiments, by, placing, metal, plates, parallel, to, the, cathode, rays, and, applying, an, electric, potential, between, the, plates, the, field, deflected, the, rays, toward, the, positively, charged, plate, providing, further, evidence, that, the, rays, carried, negative, charge, by, measuring, the, amount, of, deflection, for, a, given, electric, and, magnetic, field, in, 1890, schuster, was, able, to, estimate, the, charge, to, mass, ratio, of, the, ray, components, however, this, produced, a, value, that, was, more, than, a, thousand, times, greater, than, what, was, expected, so, little, credence, was, given, to, his, calculations, at, the, time, this, is, because, it, was, assumed, that, the, charge, carriers, were, much, heavier, hydrogen, or, nitrogen, atoms, schuster, s, estimates, would, subsequently, turn, out, to, be, largely, correct, in, 1892, hendrik, lorentz, suggested, that, the, mass, of, these, particles, electrons, could, be, a, consequence, of, their, electric, charge, while, studying, naturally, fluorescing, minerals, in, 1896, the, french, physicist, henri, becquerel, discovered, that, they, emitted, radiation, without, any, exposure, to, an, external, energy, source, these, radioactive, materials, became, the, subject, of, much, interest, by, scientists, including, the, new, zealand, physicist, ernest, rutherford, who, discovered, they, emitted, particles, he, designated, these, particles, alpha, and, beta, on, the, basis, of, their, ability, to, penetrate, matter, in, 1900, becquerel, showed, that, the, beta, rays, emitted, by, radium, could, be, deflected, by, an, electric, field, and, that, their, mass, to, charge, ratio, was, the, same, as, for, cathode, rays, this, evidence, strengthened, the, view, that, electrons, existed, as, components, of, atoms, in, 1897, the, british, physicist, j, j, thomson, with, his, colleagues, john, s, townsend, and, h, a, wilson, performed, experiments, indicating, that, cathode, rays, really, were, unique, particles, rather, than, waves, atoms, or, molecules, as, was, believed, earlier, by, 1899, he, showed, that, their, charge, to, mass, ratio, e, m, was, independent, of, cathode, material, he, further, showed, that, the, negatively, charged, particles, produced, by, radioactive, materials, by, heated, materials, and, by, illuminated, materials, were, universal, thomson, measured, m, e, for, cathode, ray, corpuscles, and, made, good, estimates, of, the, charge, e, leading, to, value, for, the, mass, m, finding, a, value, 1400, times, massive, than, the, least, massive, ion, known, hydrogen, 364, in, the, same, year, emil, wiechert, and, walter, kaufmann, also, calculated, the, e, m, ratio, but, did, not, take, the, step, of, interpreting, their, results, as, showing, a, new, particle, while, j, j, thomson, would, subsequently, in, 1899, give, estimates, for, the, electron, charge, and, mass, as, well, e, 6, 8, 10, 10, esu, and, m, 3, 10, 26, g, the, name, electron, was, adopted, for, these, particles, by, the, scientific, community, mainly, due, to, the, advocation, by, g, f, fitzgerald, j, larmor, and, h, a, lorentz, 273, the, term, was, originally, coined, by, george, johnstone, stoney, in, 1891, as, a, tentative, name, for, the, basic, unit, of, electrical, charge, which, had, then, yet, to, be, discovered, the, electron, s, charge, was, more, carefully, measured, by, the, american, physicists, robert, millikan, and, harvey, fletcher, in, their, oil, drop, experiment, of, 1909, the, results, of, which, were, published, in, 1911, this, experiment, used, an, electric, field, to, prevent, a, charged, droplet, of, oil, from, falling, as, a, result, of, gravity, this, device, could, measure, the, electric, charge, from, as, few, as, 1, 150, ions, with, an, error, margin, of, less, than, 0, 3, comparable, experiments, had, been, done, earlier, by, thomson, s, team, using, clouds, of, charged, water, droplets, generated, by, electrolysis, and, in, 1911, by, abram, ioffe, who, independently, obtained, the, same, result, as, millikan, using, charged, microparticles, of, metals, then, published, his, results, in, 1913, however, oil, drops, were, more, stable, than, water, drops, because, of, their, slower, evaporation, rate, and, thus, more, suited, to, precise, experimentation, over, longer, periods, of, time, around, the, beginning, of, the, twentieth, century, it, was, found, that, under, certain, conditions, a, fast, moving, charged, particle, caused, a, condensation, of, supersaturated, water, vapor, along, its, path, in, 1911, charles, wilson, used, this, principle, to, devise, his, cloud, chamber, so, he, could, photograph, the, tracks, of, charged, particles, such, as, fast, moving, electrons, by, 1914, experiments, by, physicists, ernest, rutherford, henry, moseley, james, franck, and, gustav, hertz, had, largely, established, the, structure, of, an, atom, as, a, dense, nucleus, of, positive, charge, surrounded, by, lower, mass, electrons, in, 1913, danish, physicist, niels, bohr, postulated, that, electrons, resided, in, quantized, energy, states, with, their, energies, determined, by, the, angular, momentum, of, the, electron, s, orbit, about, the, nucleus, the, electrons, could, move, between, those, states, or, orbits, by, the, emission, or, absorption, of, photons, of, specific, frequencies, by, means, of, these, quantized, orbits, he, accurately, explained, the, spectral, lines, of, the, hydrogen, atom, however, bohr, s, model, failed, to, account, for, the, relative, intensities, of, the, spectral, lines, and, it, was, unsuccessful, in, explaining, the, spectra, of, more, complex, atoms, chemical, bonds, between, atoms, were, explained, by, gilbert, newton, lewis, who, in, 1916, proposed, that, a, covalent, bond, between, two, atoms, is, maintained, by, a, pair, of, electrons, shared, between, them, later, in, 1927, walter, heitler, and, fritz, london, gave, the, full, explanation, of, the, electron, pair, formation, and, chemical, bonding, in, terms, of, quantum, mechanics, in, 1919, the, american, chemist, irving, langmuir, elaborated, on, the, lewis, s, static, model, of, the, atom, and, suggested, that, all, electrons, were, distributed, in, successive, concentric, nearly, spherical, shells, all, of, equal, thickness, in, turn, he, divided, the, shells, into, a, number, of, cells, each, of, which, contained, one, pair, of, electrons, with, this, model, langmuir, was, able, to, qualitatively, explain, the, chemical, properties, of, all, elements, in, the, periodic, table, which, were, known, to, largely, repeat, themselves, according, to, the, periodic, law, in, 1924, austrian, physicist, wolfgang, pauli, observed, that, the, shell, like, structure, of, the, atom, could, be, explained, by, a, set, of, four, parameters, that, defined, every, quantum, energy, state, as, long, as, each, state, was, occupied, by, no, more, than, a, single, electron, this, prohibition, against, more, than, one, electron, occupying, the, same, quantum, energy, state, became, known, as, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, the, physical, mechanism, to, explain, the, fourth, parameter, which, had, two, distinct, possible, values, was, provided, by, the, dutch, physicists, samuel, goudsmit, and, george, uhlenbeck, in, 1925, they, suggested, that, an, electron, in, addition, to, the, angular, momentum, of, its, orbit, possesses, an, intrinsic, angular, momentum, and, magnetic, dipole, moment, this, is, analogous, to, the, rotation, of, the, earth, on, its, axis, as, it, orbits, the, sun, the, intrinsic, angular, momentum, became, known, as, spin, and, explained, the, previously, mysterious, splitting, of, spectral, lines, observed, with, a, high, resolution, spectrograph, this, phenomenon, is, known, as, fine, structure, splitting, in, his, 1924, dissertation, recherches, sur, la, th, orie, des, quanta, research, on, quantum, theory, french, physicist, louis, de, broglie, hypothesized, that, all, matter, can, be, represented, as, a, de, broglie, wave, in, the, manner, of, light, that, is, under, the, appropriate, conditions, electrons, and, other, matter, would, show, properties, of, either, particles, or, waves, the, corpuscular, properties, of, a, particle, are, demonstrated, when, it, is, shown, to, have, a, localized, position, in, space, along, its, trajectory, at, any, given, moment, the, wave, like, nature, of, light, is, displayed, for, example, when, a, beam, of, light, is, passed, through, parallel, slits, thereby, creating, interference, patterns, in, 1927, george, paget, thomson, and, alexander, reid, discovered, the, interference, effect, was, produced, when, a, beam, of, electrons, was, passed, through, thin, celluloid, foils, and, later, metal, films, and, by, american, physicists, clinton, davisson, and, lester, germer, by, the, reflection, of, electrons, from, a, crystal, of, nickel, alexander, reid, who, was, thomson, s, graduate, student, performed, the, first, experiments, but, he, died, soon, after, in, a, motorcycle, accident, and, is, rarely, mentioned, de, broglie, s, prediction, of, a, wave, nature, for, electrons, led, erwin, schr, dinger, to, postulate, a, wave, equation, for, electrons, moving, under, the, influence, of, the, nucleus, in, the, atom, in, 1926, this, equation, the, schr, dinger, equation, successfully, described, how, electron, waves, propagated, rather, than, yielding, a, solution, that, determined, the, location, of, an, electron, over, time, this, wave, equation, also, could, be, used, to, predict, the, probability, of, finding, an, electron, near, a, position, especially, a, position, near, where, the, electron, was, bound, in, space, for, which, the, electron, wave, equations, did, not, change, in, time, this, approach, led, to, a, second, formulation, of, quantum, mechanics, the, first, by, heisenberg, in, 1925, and, solutions, of, schr, dinger, s, equation, like, heisenberg, s, provided, derivations, of, the, energy, states, of, an, electron, in, a, hydrogen, atom, that, were, equivalent, to, those, that, had, been, derived, first, by, bohr, in, 1913, and, that, were, known, to, reproduce, the, hydrogen, spectrum, once, spin, and, the, interaction, between, multiple, electrons, were, describable, quantum, mechanics, made, it, possible, to, predict, the, configuration, of, electrons, in, atoms, with, atomic, numbers, greater, than, hydrogen, in, 1928, building, on, wolfgang, pauli, s, work, paul, dirac, produced, a, model, of, the, electron, the, dirac, equation, consistent, with, relativity, theory, by, applying, relativistic, and, symmetry, considerations, to, the, hamiltonian, formulation, of, the, quantum, mechanics, of, the, electro, magnetic, field, in, order, to, resolve, some, problems, within, his, relativistic, equation, dirac, developed, in, 1930, a, model, of, the, vacuum, as, an, infinite, sea, of, particles, with, negative, energy, later, dubbed, the, dirac, sea, this, led, him, to, predict, the, existence, of, a, positron, the, antimatter, counterpart, of, the, electron, this, particle, was, discovered, in, 1932, by, carl, anderson, who, proposed, calling, standard, electrons, negatrons, and, using, electron, as, a, generic, term, to, describe, both, the, positively, and, negatively, charged, variants, in, 1947, willis, lamb, working, in, collaboration, with, graduate, student, robert, retherford, found, that, certain, quantum, states, of, the, hydrogen, atom, which, should, have, the, same, energy, were, shifted, in, relation, to, each, other, the, difference, came, to, be, called, the, lamb, shift, about, the, same, time, polykarp, kusch, working, with, henry, m, foley, discovered, the, magnetic, moment, of, the, electron, is, slightly, larger, than, predicted, by, dirac, s, theory, this, small, difference, was, later, called, anomalous, magnetic, dipole, moment, of, the, electron, this, difference, was, later, explained, by, the, theory, of, quantum, electrodynamics, developed, by, sin, itiro, tomonaga, julian, schwinger, and, richard, feynman, in, the, late, 1940s, with, the, development, of, the, particle, accelerator, during, the, first, half, of, the, twentieth, century, physicists, began, to, delve, deeper, into, the, properties, of, subatomic, particles, the, first, successful, attempt, to, accelerate, electrons, using, electromagnetic, induction, was, made, in, 1942, by, donald, kerst, his, initial, betatron, reached, energies, of, 2, 3, mev, while, subsequent, betatrons, achieved, 300, mev, in, 1947, synchrotron, radiation, was, discovered, with, a, 70, mev, electron, synchrotron, at, general, electric, this, radiation, was, caused, by, the, acceleration, of, electrons, through, a, magnetic, field, as, they, moved, near, the, speed, of, light, with, a, beam, energy, of, 1, 5, gev, the, first, high, energy, particle, collider, was, adone, which, began, operations, in, 1968, this, device, accelerated, electrons, and, positrons, in, opposite, directions, effectively, doubling, the, energy, of, their, collision, when, compared, to, striking, a, static, target, with, an, electron, the, large, electron, positron, collider, lep, at, cern, which, was, operational, from, 1989, to, 2000, achieved, collision, energies, of, 209, gev, and, made, important, measurements, for, the, standard, model, of, particle, physics, individual, electrons, can, now, be, easily, confined, in, ultra, small, l, 20, nm, w, 20, nm, cmos, transistors, operated, at, cryogenic, temperature, over, a, range, of, 269, c, 4, k, to, about, 258, c, 15, k, the, electron, wavefunction, spreads, in, a, semiconductor, lattice, and, negligibly, interacts, with, the, valence, band, electrons, so, it, can, be, treated, in, the, single, particle, formalism, by, replacing, its, mass, with, the, effective, mass, tensor, in, the, standard, model, of, particle, physics, electrons, belong, to, the, group, of, subatomic, particles, called, leptons, which, are, believed, to, be, fundamental, or, elementary, particles, electrons, have, the, lowest, mass, of, any, charged, lepton, or, electrically, charged, particle, of, any, type, and, belong, to, the, first, generation, of, fundamental, particles, the, second, and, third, generation, contain, charged, leptons, the, muon, and, the, tau, which, are, identical, to, the, electron, in, charge, spin, and, interactions, but, are, more, massive, leptons, differ, from, the, other, basic, constituent, of, matter, the, quarks, by, their, lack, of, strong, interaction, all, members, of, the, lepton, group, are, fermions, because, they, all, have, half, odd, integer, spin, the, electron, has, spin, 1, 2, the, invariant, mass, of, an, electron, is, approximately, 9, 109, 10, 31, kg, or, 5, 489, 10, 4, da, due, to, mass, energy, equivalence, this, corresponds, to, a, rest, energy, of, 0, 511, mev, 8, 19, 10, 14, j, the, ratio, between, the, mass, of, a, proton, and, that, of, an, electron, is, about, 1836, astronomical, measurements, show, that, the, proton, to, electron, mass, ratio, has, held, the, same, value, as, is, predicted, by, the, standard, model, for, at, least, half, the, age, of, the, universe, electrons, have, an, electric, charge, of, 1, 602, 176, 634, 10, 19, coulombs, which, is, used, as, a, standard, unit, of, charge, for, subatomic, particles, and, is, also, called, the, elementary, charge, within, the, limits, of, experimental, accuracy, the, electron, charge, is, identical, to, the, charge, of, a, proton, but, with, the, opposite, sign, the, electron, is, commonly, symbolized, by, e, and, the, positron, is, symbolized, by, e, the, electron, has, an, intrinsic, angular, momentum, or, spin, of, 2, this, property, is, usually, stated, by, referring, to, the, electron, as, a, spin, 1, 2, particle, for, such, particles, the, spin, magnitude, is, 2, while, the, result, of, the, measurement, of, a, projection, of, the, spin, on, any, axis, can, only, be, 2, in, addition, to, spin, the, electron, has, an, intrinsic, magnetic, moment, along, its, spin, axis, it, is, approximately, equal, to, one, bohr, magneton, which, is, a, physical, constant, that, is, equal, to, 9, 274, 010, 0657, 29, 10, 24, j, t, 1, the, orientation, of, the, spin, with, respect, to, the, momentum, of, the, electron, defines, the, property, of, elementary, particles, known, as, helicity, the, electron, has, no, known, substructure, nevertheless, in, condensed, matter, physics, spin, charge, separation, can, occur, in, some, materials, in, such, cases, electrons, split, into, three, independent, particles, the, spinon, the, orbiton, and, the, holon, or, chargon, the, electron, can, always, be, theoretically, considered, as, a, bound, state, of, the, three, with, the, spinon, carrying, the, spin, of, the, electron, the, orbiton, carrying, the, orbital, degree, of, freedom, and, the, chargon, carrying, the, charge, but, in, certain, conditions, they, can, behave, as, independent, quasiparticles, the, issue, of, the, radius, of, the, electron, is, a, challenging, problem, of, modern, theoretical, physics, the, admission, of, the, hypothesis, of, a, finite, radius, of, the, electron, is, incompatible, to, the, premises, of, the, theory, of, relativity, on, the, other, hand, a, point, like, electron, zero, radius, generates, serious, mathematical, difficulties, due, to, the, self, energy, of, the, electron, tending, to, infinity, observation, of, a, single, electron, in, a, penning, trap, suggests, the, upper, limit, of, the, particle, s, radius, to, be, 10, 22, meters, the, upper, bound, of, the, electron, radius, of, 10, 18, meters, can, be, derived, using, the, uncertainty, relation, in, energy, there, is, also, a, physical, constant, called, the, classical, electron, radius, with, the, much, larger, value, of, 2, 8179, 10, 15, m, greater, than, the, radius, of, the, proton, however, the, terminology, comes, from, a, simplistic, calculation, that, ignores, the, effects, of, quantum, mechanics, in, reality, the, so, called, classical, electron, radius, has, little, to, do, with, the, true, fundamental, structure, of, the, electron, there, are, elementary, particles, that, spontaneously, decay, into, less, massive, particles, an, example, is, the, muon, with, a, mean, lifetime, of, 2, 2, 10, 6, seconds, which, decays, into, an, electron, a, muon, neutrino, and, an, electron, antineutrino, the, electron, on, the, other, hand, is, thought, to, be, stable, on, theoretical, grounds, the, electron, is, the, least, massive, particle, with, non, zero, electric, charge, so, its, decay, would, violate, charge, conservation, the, experimental, lower, bound, for, the, electron, s, mean, lifetime, is, 6, 6, 10, 28, years, at, a, 90, confidence, level, as, with, all, particles, electrons, can, act, as, waves, this, is, called, the, wave, particle, duality, and, can, be, demonstrated, using, the, double, slit, experiment, the, wave, like, nature, of, the, electron, allows, it, to, pass, through, two, parallel, slits, simultaneously, rather, than, just, one, slit, as, would, be, the, case, for, a, classical, particle, in, quantum, mechanics, the, wave, like, property, of, one, particle, can, be, described, mathematically, as, a, complex, valued, function, the, wave, function, commonly, denoted, by, the, greek, letter, psi, when, the, absolute, value, of, this, function, is, squared, it, gives, the, probability, that, a, particle, will, be, observed, near, a, location, a, probability, density, 162, 218, electrons, are, identical, particles, because, they, cannot, be, distinguished, from, each, other, by, their, intrinsic, physical, properties, in, quantum, mechanics, this, means, that, a, pair, of, interacting, electrons, must, be, able, to, swap, positions, without, an, observable, change, to, the, state, of, the, system, the, wave, function, of, fermions, including, electrons, is, antisymmetric, meaning, that, it, changes, sign, when, two, electrons, are, swapped, that, is, r, 1, r, 2, r, 2, r, 1, where, the, variables, r, 1, and, r, 2, correspond, to, the, first, and, second, electrons, respectively, since, the, absolute, value, is, not, changed, by, a, sign, swap, this, corresponds, to, equal, probabilities, bosons, such, as, the, photon, have, symmetric, wave, functions, instead, 162, 218, in, the, case, of, antisymmetry, solutions, of, the, wave, equation, for, interacting, electrons, result, in, a, zero, probability, that, each, pair, will, occupy, the, same, location, or, state, this, is, responsible, for, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, which, precludes, any, two, electrons, from, occupying, the, same, quantum, state, this, principle, explains, many, of, the, properties, of, electrons, for, example, it, causes, groups, of, bound, electrons, to, occupy, different, orbitals, in, an, atom, rather, than, all, overlapping, each, other, in, the, same, orbit, 162, 218, in, a, simplified, picture, which, often, tends, to, give, the, wrong, idea, but, may, serve, to, illustrate, some, aspects, every, photon, spends, some, time, as, a, combination, of, a, virtual, electron, plus, its, antiparticle, the, virtual, positron, which, rapidly, annihilate, each, other, shortly, thereafter, the, combination, of, the, energy, variation, needed, to, create, these, particles, and, the, time, during, which, they, exist, fall, under, the, threshold, of, detectability, expressed, by, the, heisenberg, uncertainty, relation, e, t, in, effect, the, energy, needed, to, create, these, virtual, particles, e, can, be, borrowed, from, the, vacuum, for, a, period, of, time, t, so, that, their, product, is, no, more, than, the, reduced, planck, constant, 6, 6, 10, 16, ev, s, thus, for, a, virtual, electron, t, is, at, most, 1, 3, 10, 21, s, while, an, electron, positron, virtual, pair, is, in, existence, the, coulomb, force, from, the, ambient, electric, field, surrounding, an, electron, causes, a, created, positron, to, be, attracted, to, the, original, electron, while, a, created, electron, experiences, a, repulsion, this, causes, what, is, called, vacuum, polarization, in, effect, the, vacuum, behaves, like, a, medium, having, a, dielectric, permittivity, more, than, unity, thus, the, effective, charge, of, an, electron, is, actually, smaller, than, its, true, value, and, the, charge, decreases, with, increasing, distance, from, the, electron, this, polarization, was, confirmed, experimentally, in, 1997, using, the, japanese, tristan, particle, accelerator, virtual, particles, cause, a, comparable, shielding, effect, for, the, mass, of, the, electron, the, interaction, with, virtual, particles, also, explains, the, small, about, 0, 1, deviation, of, the, intrinsic, magnetic, moment, of, the, electron, from, the, bohr, magneton, the, anomalous, magnetic, moment, the, extraordinarily, precise, agreement, of, this, predicted, difference, with, the, experimentally, determined, value, is, viewed, as, one, of, the, great, achievements, of, quantum, electrodynamics, the, apparent, paradox, in, classical, physics, of, a, point, particle, electron, having, intrinsic, angular, momentum, and, magnetic, moment, can, be, explained, by, the, formation, of, virtual, photons, in, the, electric, field, generated, by, the, electron, these, photons, can, heuristically, be, thought, of, as, causing, the, electron, to, shift, about, in, a, jittery, fashion, known, as, zitterbewegung, which, results, in, a, net, circular, motion, with, precession, this, motion, produces, both, the, spin, and, the, magnetic, moment, of, the, electron, in, atoms, this, creation, of, virtual, photons, explains, the, lamb, shift, observed, in, spectral, lines, the, compton, wavelength, shows, that, near, elementary, particles, such, as, the, electron, the, uncertainty, of, the, energy, allows, for, the, creation, of, virtual, particles, near, the, electron, this, wavelength, explains, the, static, of, virtual, particles, around, elementary, particles, at, a, close, distance, an, electron, generates, an, electric, field, that, exerts, an, attractive, force, on, a, particle, with, a, positive, charge, such, as, the, proton, and, a, repulsive, force, on, a, particle, with, a, negative, charge, the, strength, of, this, force, in, nonrelativistic, approximation, is, determined, by, coulomb, s, inverse, square, law, 58, 61, when, an, electron, is, in, motion, it, generates, a, magnetic, field, 140, the, amp, re, maxwell, law, relates, the, magnetic, field, to, the, mass, motion, of, electrons, the, current, with, respect, to, an, observer, this, property, of, induction, supplies, the, magnetic, field, that, drives, an, electric, motor, the, electromagnetic, field, of, an, arbitrary, moving, charged, particle, is, expressed, by, the, li, nard, wiechert, potentials, which, are, valid, even, when, the, particle, s, speed, is, close, to, that, of, light, relativistic, 429, 434, when, an, electron, is, moving, through, a, magnetic, field, it, is, subject, to, the, lorentz, force, that, acts, perpendicularly, to, the, plane, defined, by, the, magnetic, field, and, the, electron, velocity, this, centripetal, force, causes, the, electron, to, follow, a, helical, trajectory, through, the, field, at, a, radius, called, the, gyroradius, the, acceleration, from, this, curving, motion, induces, the, electron, to, radiate, energy, in, the, form, of, synchrotron, radiation, 160, the, energy, emission, in, turn, causes, a, recoil, of, the, electron, known, as, the, abraham, lorentz, dirac, force, which, creates, a, friction, that, slows, the, electron, this, force, is, caused, by, a, back, reaction, of, the, electron, s, own, field, upon, itself, photons, mediate, electromagnetic, interactions, between, particles, in, quantum, electrodynamics, an, isolated, electron, at, a, constant, velocity, cannot, emit, or, absorb, a, real, photon, doing, so, would, violate, conservation, of, energy, and, momentum, instead, virtual, photons, can, transfer, momentum, between, two, charged, particles, this, exchange, of, virtual, photons, for, example, generates, the, coulomb, force, energy, emission, can, occur, when, a, moving, electron, is, deflected, by, a, charged, particle, such, as, a, proton, the, deceleration, of, the, electron, results, in, the, emission, of, bremsstrahlung, radiation, an, inelastic, collision, between, a, photon, light, and, a, solitary, free, electron, is, called, compton, scattering, this, collision, results, in, a, transfer, of, momentum, and, energy, between, the, particles, which, modifies, the, wavelength, of, the, photon, by, an, amount, called, the, compton, shift, the, maximum, magnitude, of, this, wavelength, shift, is, h, m, e, c, which, is, known, as, the, compton, wavelength, for, an, electron, it, has, a, value, of, 2, 43, 10, 12, m, when, the, wavelength, of, the, light, is, long, for, instance, the, wavelength, of, the, visible, light, is, 0, 4, 0, 7, m, the, wavelength, shift, becomes, negligible, such, interaction, between, the, light, and, free, electrons, is, called, thomson, scattering, or, linear, thomson, scattering, the, relative, strength, of, the, electromagnetic, interaction, between, two, charged, particles, such, as, an, electron, and, a, proton, is, given, by, the, fine, structure, constant, this, value, is, a, dimensionless, quantity, formed, by, the, ratio, of, two, energies, the, electrostatic, energy, of, attraction, or, repulsion, at, a, separation, of, one, compton, wavelength, and, the, rest, energy, of, the, charge, it, is, given, by, 0, 007, 297, 353, which, is, approximately, equal, to, 1, 137, when, electrons, and, positrons, collide, they, annihilate, each, other, giving, rise, to, two, or, more, gamma, ray, photons, if, the, electron, and, positron, have, negligible, momentum, a, positronium, atom, can, form, before, annihilation, results, in, two, or, three, gamma, ray, photons, totalling, 1, 022, mev, on, the, other, hand, a, high, energy, photon, can, transform, into, an, electron, and, a, positron, by, a, process, called, pair, production, but, only, in, the, presence, of, a, nearby, charged, particle, such, as, a, nucleus, in, the, theory, of, electroweak, interaction, the, left, handed, component, of, electron, s, wavefunction, forms, a, weak, isospin, doublet, with, the, electron, neutrino, this, means, that, during, weak, interactions, electron, neutrinos, behave, like, electrons, either, member, of, this, doublet, can, undergo, a, charged, current, interaction, by, emitting, or, absorbing, a, w, and, be, converted, into, the, other, member, charge, is, conserved, during, this, reaction, because, the, w, boson, also, carries, a, charge, canceling, out, any, net, change, during, the, transmutation, charged, current, interactions, are, responsible, for, the, phenomenon, of, beta, decay, in, a, radioactive, atom, both, the, electron, and, electron, neutrino, can, undergo, a, neutral, current, interaction, via, a, z, 0, exchange, and, this, is, responsible, for, neutrino, electron, elastic, scattering, an, electron, can, be, bound, to, the, nucleus, of, an, atom, by, the, attractive, coulomb, force, a, system, of, one, or, more, electrons, bound, to, a, nucleus, is, called, an, atom, if, the, number, of, electrons, is, different, from, the, nucleus, s, electrical, charge, such, an, atom, is, called, an, ion, the, wave, like, behavior, of, a, bound, electron, is, described, by, a, function, called, an, atomic, orbital, each, orbital, has, its, own, set, of, quantum, numbers, such, as, energy, angular, momentum, and, projection, of, angular, momentum, and, only, a, discrete, set, of, these, orbitals, exist, around, the, nucleus, according, to, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, each, orbital, can, be, occupied, by, up, to, two, electrons, which, must, differ, in, their, spin, quantum, number, electrons, can, transfer, between, different, orbitals, by, the, emission, or, absorption, of, photons, with, an, energy, that, matches, the, difference, in, potential, 159, 160, other, methods, of, orbital, transfer, include, collisions, with, particles, such, as, electrons, and, the, auger, effect, to, escape, the, atom, the, energy, of, the, electron, must, be, increased, above, its, binding, energy, to, the, atom, this, occurs, for, example, with, the, photoelectric, effect, where, an, incident, photon, exceeding, the, atom, s, ionization, energy, is, absorbed, by, the, electron, 127, 132, the, orbital, angular, momentum, of, electrons, is, quantized, because, the, electron, is, charged, it, produces, an, orbital, magnetic, moment, that, is, proportional, to, the, angular, momentum, the, net, magnetic, moment, of, an, atom, is, equal, to, the, vector, sum, of, orbital, and, spin, magnetic, moments, of, all, electrons, and, the, nucleus, the, magnetic, moment, of, the, nucleus, is, negligible, compared, with, that, of, the, electrons, the, magnetic, moments, of, the, electrons, that, occupy, the, same, orbital, called, paired, electrons, cancel, each, other, out, the, chemical, bond, between, atoms, occurs, as, a, result, of, electromagnetic, interactions, as, described, by, the, laws, of, quantum, mechanics, the, strongest, bonds, are, formed, by, the, sharing, or, transfer, of, electrons, between, atoms, allowing, the, formation, of, molecules, within, a, molecule, electrons, move, under, the, influence, of, several, nuclei, and, occupy, molecular, orbitals, much, as, they, can, occupy, atomic, orbitals, in, isolated, atoms, a, fundamental, factor, in, these, molecular, structures, is, the, existence, of, electron, pairs, these, are, electrons, with, opposed, spins, allowing, them, to, occupy, the, same, molecular, orbital, without, violating, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, much, like, in, atoms, different, molecular, orbitals, have, different, spatial, distribution, of, the, electron, density, for, instance, in, bonded, pairs, i, e, in, the, pairs, that, actually, bind, atoms, together, electrons, can, be, found, with, the, maximal, probability, in, a, relatively, small, volume, between, the, nuclei, by, contrast, in, non, bonded, pairs, electrons, are, distributed, in, a, large, volume, around, nuclei, if, a, body, has, more, or, fewer, electrons, than, are, required, to, balance, the, positive, charge, of, the, nuclei, then, that, object, has, a, net, electric, charge, when, there, is, an, excess, of, electrons, the, object, is, said, to, be, negatively, charged, when, there, are, fewer, electrons, than, the, number, of, protons, in, nuclei, the, object, is, said, to, be, positively, charged, when, the, number, of, electrons, and, the, number, of, protons, are, equal, their, charges, cancel, each, other, and, the, object, is, said, to, be, electrically, neutral, a, macroscopic, body, can, develop, an, electric, charge, through, rubbing, by, the, triboelectric, effect, independent, electrons, moving, in, vacuum, are, termed, free, electrons, electrons, in, metals, also, behave, as, if, they, were, free, in, reality, the, particles, that, are, commonly, termed, electrons, in, metals, and, other, solids, are, quasi, electrons, quasiparticles, which, have, the, same, electrical, charge, spin, and, magnetic, moment, as, real, electrons, but, might, have, a, different, mass, when, free, electrons, both, in, vacuum, and, metals, move, they, produce, a, net, flow, of, charge, called, an, electric, current, which, generates, a, magnetic, field, likewise, a, current, can, be, created, by, a, changing, magnetic, field, these, interactions, are, described, mathematically, by, maxwell, s, equations, at, a, given, temperature, each, material, has, an, electrical, conductivity, that, determines, the, value, of, electric, current, when, an, electric, potential, is, applied, examples, of, good, conductors, include, metals, such, as, copper, and, gold, whereas, glass, and, teflon, are, poor, conductors, in, any, dielectric, material, the, electrons, remain, bound, to, their, respective, atoms, and, the, material, behaves, as, an, insulator, most, semiconductors, have, a, variable, level, of, conductivity, that, lies, between, the, extremes, of, conduction, and, insulation, on, the, other, hand, metals, have, an, electronic, band, structure, containing, partially, filled, electronic, bands, the, presence, of, such, bands, allows, electrons, in, metals, to, behave, as, if, they, were, free, or, delocalized, electrons, these, electrons, are, not, associated, with, specific, atoms, so, when, an, electric, field, is, applied, they, are, free, to, move, like, a, gas, called, fermi, gas, through, the, material, much, like, free, electrons, because, of, collisions, between, electrons, and, atoms, the, drift, velocity, of, electrons, in, a, conductor, is, on, the, order, of, millimeters, per, second, however, the, speed, at, which, a, change, of, current, at, one, point, in, the, material, causes, changes, in, currents, in, other, parts, of, the, material, the, velocity, of, propagation, is, typically, about, 75, of, light, speed, this, occurs, because, electrical, signals, propagate, as, a, wave, with, the, velocity, dependent, on, the, dielectric, constant, of, the, material, metals, make, relatively, good, conductors, of, heat, primarily, because, the, delocalized, electrons, are, free, to, transport, thermal, energy, between, atoms, however, unlike, electrical, conductivity, the, thermal, conductivity, of, a, metal, is, nearly, independent, of, temperature, this, is, expressed, mathematically, by, the, wiedemann, franz, law, which, states, that, the, ratio, of, thermal, conductivity, to, the, electrical, conductivity, is, proportional, to, the, temperature, the, thermal, disorder, in, the, metallic, lattice, increases, the, electrical, resistivity, of, the, material, producing, a, temperature, dependence, for, electric, current, when, cooled, below, a, point, called, the, critical, temperature, materials, can, undergo, a, phase, transition, in, which, they, lose, all, resistivity, to, electric, current, in, a, process, known, as, superconductivity, in, bcs, theory, pairs, of, electrons, called, cooper, pairs, have, their, motion, coupled, to, nearby, matter, via, lattice, vibrations, called, phonons, thereby, avoiding, the, collisions, with, atoms, that, normally, create, electrical, resistance, cooper, pairs, have, a, radius, of, roughly, 100, nm, so, they, can, overlap, each, other, however, the, mechanism, by, which, higher, temperature, superconductors, operate, remains, uncertain, electrons, inside, conducting, solids, which, are, quasi, particles, themselves, when, tightly, confined, at, temperatures, close, to, absolute, zero, behave, as, though, they, had, split, into, three, other, quasiparticles, spinons, orbitons, and, holons, the, former, carries, spin, and, magnetic, moment, the, next, carries, its, orbital, location, while, the, latter, electrical, charge, according, to, einstein, s, theory, of, special, relativity, as, an, electron, s, speed, approaches, the, speed, of, light, from, an, observer, s, point, of, view, its, relativistic, mass, increases, thereby, making, it, more, and, more, difficult, to, accelerate, it, from, within, the, observer, s, frame, of, reference, the, speed, of, an, electron, can, approach, but, never, reach, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, c, however, when, relativistic, electrons, that, is, electrons, moving, at, a, speed, close, to, c, are, injected, into, a, dielectric, medium, such, as, water, where, the, local, speed, of, light, is, significantly, less, than, c, the, electrons, temporarily, travel, faster, than, light, in, the, medium, as, they, interact, with, the, medium, they, generate, a, faint, light, called, cherenkov, radiation, the, effects, of, special, relativity, are, based, on, a, quantity, known, as, the, lorentz, factor, defined, as, 1, 1, v, 2, c, 2, displaystyle, scriptstyle, gamma, 1, sqrt, 1, v, 2, c, 2, where, v, is, the, speed, of, the, particle, the, kinetic, energy, k, e, of, an, electron, moving, with, velocity, v, is, where, m, e, is, the, mass, of, electron, for, example, the, stanford, linear, accelerator, can, accelerate, an, electron, to, roughly, 51, gev, since, an, electron, behaves, as, a, wave, at, a, given, velocity, it, has, a, characteristic, de, broglie, wavelength, this, is, given, by, e, h, p, where, h, is, the, planck, constant, and, p, is, the, momentum, for, the, 51, gev, electron, above, the, wavelength, is, about, 2, 4, 10, 17, m, small, enough, to, explore, structures, well, below, the, size, of, an, atomic, nucleus, the, big, bang, theory, is, the, most, widely, accepted, scientific, theory, to, explain, the, early, stages, in, the, evolution, of, the, universe, for, the, first, millisecond, of, the, big, bang, the, temperatures, were, over, 10, billion, kelvins, and, photons, had, mean, energies, over, a, million, electronvolts, these, photons, were, sufficiently, energetic, that, they, could, react, with, each, other, to, form, pairs, of, electrons, and, positrons, likewise, positron, electron, pairs, annihilated, each, other, and, emitted, energetic, photons, an, equilibrium, between, electrons, positrons, and, photons, was, maintained, during, this, phase, of, the, evolution, of, the, universe, after, 15, seconds, had, passed, however, the, temperature, of, the, universe, dropped, below, the, threshold, where, electron, positron, formation, could, occur, most, of, the, surviving, electrons, and, positrons, annihilated, each, other, releasing, gamma, radiation, that, briefly, reheated, the, universe, for, reasons, that, remain, uncertain, during, the, annihilation, process, there, was, an, excess, in, the, number, of, particles, over, antiparticles, hence, about, one, electron, for, every, billion, electron, positron, pairs, survived, this, excess, matched, the, excess, of, protons, over, antiprotons, in, a, condition, known, as, baryon, asymmetry, resulting, in, a, net, charge, of, zero, for, the, universe, the, surviving, protons, and, neutrons, began, to, participate, in, reactions, with, each, other, in, the, process, known, as, nucleosynthesis, forming, isotopes, of, hydrogen, and, helium, with, trace, amounts, of, lithium, this, process, peaked, after, about, five, minutes, any, leftover, neutrons, underwent, negative, beta, decay, with, a, half, life, of, about, a, thousand, seconds, releasing, a, proton, and, electron, in, the, process, for, about, the, next, 300, 000, 400, 000, years, the, excess, electrons, remained, too, energetic, to, bind, with, atomic, nuclei, what, followed, is, a, period, known, as, recombination, when, neutral, atoms, were, formed, and, the, expanding, universe, became, transparent, to, radiation, roughly, one, million, years, after, the, big, bang, the, first, generation, of, stars, began, to, form, within, a, star, stellar, nucleosynthesis, results, in, the, production, of, positrons, from, the, fusion, of, atomic, nuclei, these, antimatter, particles, immediately, annihilate, with, electrons, releasing, gamma, rays, the, net, result, is, a, steady, reduction, in, the, number, of, electrons, and, a, matching, increase, in, the, number, of, neutrons, however, the, process, of, stellar, evolution, can, result, in, the, synthesis, of, radioactive, isotopes, selected, isotopes, can, subsequently, undergo, negative, beta, decay, emitting, an, electron, and, antineutrino, from, the, nucleus, an, example, is, the, cobalt, 60, 60, co, isotope, which, decays, to, form, nickel, 60, 60, ni, at, the, end, of, its, lifetime, a, star, with, more, than, about, 20, solar, masses, can, undergo, gravitational, collapse, to, form, a, black, hole, according, to, classical, physics, these, massive, stellar, objects, exert, a, gravitational, attraction, that, is, strong, enough, to, prevent, anything, even, electromagnetic, radiation, from, escaping, past, the, schwarzschild, radius, however, quantum, mechanical, effects, are, believed, to, potentially, allow, the, emission, of, hawking, radiation, at, this, distance, electrons, and, positrons, are, thought, to, be, created, at, the, event, horizon, of, these, stellar, remnants, when, a, pair, of, virtual, particles, such, as, an, electron, and, positron, is, created, in, the, vicinity, of, the, event, horizon, random, spatial, positioning, might, result, in, one, of, them, to, appear, on, the, exterior, this, process, is, called, quantum, tunnelling, the, gravitational, potential, of, the, black, hole, can, then, supply, the, energy, that, transforms, this, virtual, particle, into, a, real, particle, allowing, it, to, radiate, away, into, space, in, exchange, the, other, member, of, the, pair, is, given, negative, energy, which, results, in, a, net, loss, of, mass, energy, by, the, black, hole, the, rate, of, hawking, radiation, increases, with, decreasing, mass, eventually, causing, the, black, hole, to, evaporate, away, until, finally, it, explodes, cosmic, rays, are, particles, traveling, through, space, with, high, energies, energy, events, as, high, as, 3, 0, 10, 20, ev, have, been, recorded, when, these, particles, collide, with, nucleons, in, the, earth, s, atmosphere, a, shower, of, particles, is, generated, including, pions, more, than, half, of, the, cosmic, radiation, observed, from, the, earth, s, surface, consists, of, muons, the, particle, called, a, muon, is, a, lepton, produced, in, the, upper, atmosphere, by, the, decay, of, a, pion, a, muon, in, turn, can, decay, to, form, an, electron, or, positron, remote, observation, of, electrons, requires, detection, of, their, radiated, energy, for, example, in, high, energy, environments, such, as, the, corona, of, a, star, free, electrons, form, a, plasma, that, radiates, energy, due, to, bremsstrahlung, radiation, electron, gas, can, undergo, plasma, oscillation, which, is, waves, caused, by, synchronized, variations, in, electron, density, and, these, produce, energy, emissions, that, can, be, detected, by, using, radio, telescopes, the, frequency, of, a, photon, is, proportional, to, its, energy, as, a, bound, electron, transitions, between, different, energy, levels, of, an, atom, it, absorbs, or, emits, photons, at, characteristic, frequencies, for, instance, when, atoms, are, irradiated, by, a, source, with, a, broad, spectrum, distinct, dark, lines, appear, in, the, spectrum, of, transmitted, radiation, in, places, where, the, corresponding, frequency, is, absorbed, by, the, atom, s, electrons, each, element, or, molecule, displays, a, characteristic, set, of, spectral, lines, such, as, the, hydrogen, spectral, series, when, detected, spectroscopic, measurements, of, the, strength, and, width, of, these, lines, allow, the, composition, and, physical, properties, of, a, substance, to, be, determined, in, laboratory, conditions, the, interactions, of, individual, electrons, can, be, observed, by, means, of, particle, detectors, which, allow, measurement, of, specific, properties, such, as, energy, spin, and, charge, the, development, of, the, paul, trap, and, penning, trap, allows, charged, particles, to, be, contained, within, a, small, region, for, long, durations, this, enables, precise, measurements, of, the, particle, properties, for, example, in, one, instance, a, penning, trap, was, used, to, contain, a, single, electron, for, a, period, of, 10, months, the, magnetic, moment, of, the, electron, was, measured, to, a, precision, of, eleven, digits, which, in, 1980, was, a, greater, accuracy, than, for, any, other, physical, constant, the, first, video, images, of, an, electron, s, energy, distribution, were, captured, by, a, team, at, lund, university, in, sweden, february, 2008, the, scientists, used, extremely, short, flashes, of, light, called, attosecond, pulses, which, allowed, an, electron, s, motion, to, be, observed, for, the, first, time, the, distribution, of, the, electrons, in, solid, materials, can, be, visualized, by, angle, resolved, photoemission, spectroscopy, arpes, this, technique, employs, the, photoelectric, effect, to, measure, the, reciprocal, space, a, mathematical, representation, of, periodic, structures, that, is, used, to, infer, the, original, structure, arpes, can, be, used, to, determine, the, direction, speed, and, scattering, of,

usually, require, no, filler, material, this, welding, technique, must, be, performed, in, a, vacuum, to, prevent, the, electrons, from, interacting, with, the, gas, before, reaching, their, target, and, it, can, be, used, to, join, conductive, materials, that, would, otherwise, be, considered, unsuitable, for, welding, electron, beam, lithography, ebl, is, a, method, of, etching, semiconductors, at, resolutions, smaller, than, a, micrometer, this, technique, is, limited, by, high, costs, slow, performance, the, need, to, operate, the, beam, in, the, vacuum, and, the, tendency, of, the, electrons, to, scatter, in, solids, the, last, problem, limits, the, resolution, to, about, 10, nm, for, this, reason, ebl, is, primarily, used, for, the, production, of, small, numbers, of, specialized, integrated, circuits, electron, beam, processing, is, used, to, irradiate, materials, in, order, to, change, their, physical, properties, or, sterilize, medical, and, food, products,

relative, phase, and, energy, as, the, beam, interacts, with, the, material, microscopists, can, record, these, changes, in, the, electron, beam, to, produce, atomically, resolved, images, of, the, material, in, blue, light, conventional, optical, microscopes, have, a, diffraction, limited, resolution, of, about, 200, nm, by, comparison, electron, microscopes, are, limited, by, the, de, broglie, wavelength, of, the, electron, this, wavelength, for, example, is, equal, to, 0, 0037, nm, for, electrons, accelerated, across, a, 100, 000, volt, potential, the, transmission, electron, aberration, corrected, microscope, is, capable, of, sub, 0, 05, nm, resolution, which, is, more, than, enough, to, resolve, individual, atoms, this, capability, makes, the, electron, microscope, a, useful,
