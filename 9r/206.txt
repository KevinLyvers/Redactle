a, lenticular, galaxy, denoted, s0, is, a, type, of, galaxy, intermediate, between, an, elliptical, denoted, e, and, a, spiral, galaxy, in, galaxy, morphological, classification, schemes, it, contains, a, large, scale, disc, but, does, not, have, large, scale, spiral, arms, lenticular, galaxies, are, disc, galaxies, that, have, used, up, or, lost, most, of, their, interstellar, matter, and, therefore, have, very, little, ongoing, star, formation, they, may, however, retain, significant, dust, in, their, disks, as, a, result, they, consist, mainly, of, aging, stars, like, elliptical, galaxies, despite, the, morphological, differences, lenticular, and, elliptical, galaxies, share, common, properties, like, spectral, features, and, scaling, relations, both, can, be, considered, early, type, galaxies, that, are, passively, evolving, at, least, in, the, local, part, of, the, universe, connecting, the, e, galaxies, with, the, s0, galaxies, are, the, es, galaxies, with, intermediate, scale, discs, lenticular, galaxies, are, unique, in, that, they, have, a, visible, disk, component, as, well, as, a, prominent, bulge, component, they, have, much, higher, bulge, to, disk, ratios, than, typical, spirals, and, do, not, have, the, canonical, spiral, arm, structure, of, late, type, galaxies, yet, may, exhibit, a, central, bar, this, bulge, dominance, can, be, seen, in, the, axis, ratio, i, e, the, ratio, between, the, observed, minor, and, major, axial, of, a, disk, galaxy, distribution, of, a, lenticular, galaxy, sample, the, distribution, for, lenticular, galaxies, rises, steadily, in, the, range, 0, 25, to, 0, 85, whereas, the, distribution, for, spirals, is, essentially, flat, in, that, same, range, larger, axial, ratios, can, be, explained, by, observing, face, on, disk, galaxies, or, by, having, a, sample, of, spheroidal, bulge, dominated, galaxies, imagine, looking, at, two, disk, galaxies, edge, on, one, with, a, bulge, and, one, without, a, bulge, the, galaxy, with, a, prominent, bulge, will, have, a, larger, edge, on, axial, ratio, compared, to, the, galaxy, without, a, bulge, based, on, the, definition, of, axial, ratio, thus, a, sample, of, disk, galaxies, with, prominent, spheroidal, components, will, have, more, galaxies, at, larger, axial, ratios, the, fact, that, the, lenticular, galaxy, distribution, rises, with, increasing, observed, axial, ratio, implies, that, lenticulars, are, dominated, by, a, central, bulge, component, lenticular, galaxies, are, often, considered, to, be, a, poorly, understood, transition, state, between, spiral, and, elliptical, galaxies, which, results, in, their, intermediate, placement, on, the, hubble, sequence, this, results, from, lenticulars, having, both, prominent, disk, and, bulge, components, the, disk, component, is, usually, featureless, which, precludes, a, classification, system, similar, to, spiral, galaxies, as, the, bulge, component, is, usually, spherical, elliptical, galaxy, classifications, are, also, unsuitable, lenticular, galaxies, are, thus, divided, into, subclasses, based, upon, either, the, amount, of, dust, present, or, the, prominence, of, a, central, bar, the, classes, of, lenticular, galaxies, with, no, bar, are, s0, 1, s0, 2, and, s0, 3, where, the, subscripted, numbers, indicate, the, amount, of, dust, absorption, in, the, disk, component, the, corresponding, classes, for, lenticulars, with, a, central, bar, are, sb0, 1, sb0, 2, and, sb0, 3, the, surface, brightness, profiles, of, lenticular, galaxies, are, well, described, by, the, sum, of, a, s, rsic, model, for, the, spheroidal, component, plus, an, exponentially, declining, model, s, rsic, index, of, n, 1, for, the, disk, and, often, a, third, component, for, the, bar, sometimes, there, is, an, observed, truncation, in, the, surface, brightness, profiles, of, lenticular, galaxies, at, 4, disk, scalelengths, these, features, are, consistent, with, the, general, structure, of, spiral, galaxies, however, the, bulge, component, of, lenticulars, is, more, closely, related, to, elliptical, galaxies, in, terms, of, morphological, classification, this, spheroidal, region, which, dominates, the, inner, structure, of, lenticular, galaxies, has, a, steeper, surface, brightness, profile, s, rsic, index, typically, ranging, from, n, 1, to, 4, than, the, disk, component, lenticular, galaxy, samples, are, distinguishable, from, the, diskless, excluding, small, nuclear, disks, elliptical, galaxy, population, through, analysis, of, their, surface, brightness, profiles, like, spiral, galaxies, lenticular, galaxies, can, possess, a, central, bar, structure, while, the, classification, system, for, normal, lenticulars, depends, on, dust, content, barred, lenticular, galaxies, are, classified, by, the, prominence, of, the, central, bar, sb0, 1, galaxies, have, the, least, defined, bar, structure, and, are, only, classified, as, having, slightly, enhanced, surface, brightness, along, opposite, sides, of, the, central, bulge, the, prominence, of, the, bar, increases, with, index, number, thus, sb0, 3, galaxies, like, the, ngc, 1460, have, very, well, defined, bars, that, can, extend, through, the, transition, region, between, the, bulge, and, disk, ngc, 1460, is, actually, the, galaxy, with, one, of, the, largest, bars, seen, among, lenticular, galaxies, unfortunately, the, properties, of, bars, in, lenticular, galaxies, have, not, been, researched, in, great, detail, understanding, these, properties, as, well, as, understanding, the, formation, mechanism, for, bars, would, help, clarify, the, formation, or, evolution, history, of, lenticular, galaxies, ngc, 1375, and, ngc, 1175, are, examples, of, lenticular, galaxies, that, have, so, called, box, shaped, bulges, they, are, classified, as, sb0, pec, box, shaped, bulges, are, seen, in, edge, on, galaxies, mostly, spiral, but, rarely, lenticular, in, many, respects, the, composition, of, lenticular, galaxies, is, like, that, of, ellipticals, for, example, they, both, consist, of, predominately, older, hence, redder, stars, all, of, their, stars, are, thought, to, be, older, than, about, a, billion, years, in, agreement, with, their, offset, from, the, tully, fisher, relation, see, below, in, addition, to, these, general, stellar, attributes, globular, clusters, are, found, more, frequently, in, lenticular, galaxies, than, in, spiral, galaxies, of, similar, mass, and, luminosity, they, also, have, little, to, no, molecular, gas, hence, the, lack, of, star, formation, and, no, significant, hydrogen, or, 21, cm, emission, finally, unlike, ellipticals, they, may, still, possess, significant, dust, lenticular, galaxies, share, kinematic, properties, with, both, spiral, and, elliptical, galaxies, this, is, due, to, the, significant, bulge, and, disk, nature, of, lenticulars, the, bulge, component, is, similar, to, elliptical, galaxies, in, that, it, is, pressure, supported, by, a, central, velocity, dispersion, this, situation, is, analogous, to, a, balloon, where, the, motions, of, the, air, particles, stars, in, a, bulge, s, case, are, dominated, by, random, motions, however, the, kinematics, of, lenticular, galaxies, are, dominated, by, the, rotationally, supported, disk, rotation, support, implies, the, average, circular, motion, of, stars, in, the, disk, is, responsible, for, the, stability, of, the, galaxy, thus, kinematics, are, often, used, to, distinguish, lenticular, galaxies, from, elliptical, galaxies, determining, the, distinction, between, elliptical, galaxies, and, lenticular, galaxies, often, relies, on, the, measurements, of, velocity, dispersion, rotational, velocity, v, and, ellipticity, in, order, to, differentiate, between, lenticulars, and, ellipticals, one, typically, looks, at, the, v, ratio, for, a, fixed, for, example, a, rough, criterion, for, distinguishing, between, lenticular, and, elliptical, galaxies, is, that, elliptical, galaxies, have, v, 0, 5, for, 0, 3, the, motivation, behind, this, criterion, is, that, lenticular, galaxies, do, have, prominent, bulge, and, disk, components, whereas, elliptical, galaxies, have, no, disk, structure, thus, lenticulars, have, much, larger, v, ratios, than, ellipticals, due, to, their, non, negligible, rotational, velocities, due, to, the, disk, component, in, addition, to, not, having, as, prominent, of, a, bulge, component, compared, to, elliptical, galaxies, however, this, approach, using, a, single, ratio, for, each, galaxy, is, problematic, due, to, the, dependence, of, the, v, ratio, on, the, radius, out, to, which, it, is, measured, in, some, early, type, galaxies, for, example, the, es, galaxies, that, bridge, the, e, and, s0, galaxies, with, their, intermediate, scale, disks, have, a, high, v, ratio, at, intermediate, radii, that, then, drops, to, a, low, ratio, at, large, radii, the, kinematics, of, disk, galaxies, are, usually, determined, by, h, or, 21, cm, emission, lines, which, are, typically, not, present, in, lenticular, galaxies, due, to, their, general, lack, of, cool, gas, thus, kinematic, information, and, rough, mass, estimates, for, lenticular, galaxies, often, comes, from, stellar, absorption, lines, which, are, less, reliable, than, emission, line, measurements, there, is, also, a, considerable, amount, of, difficulty, in, deriving, accurate, rotational, velocities, for, lenticular, galaxies, this, is, a, combined, effect, from, lenticulars, having, difficult, inclination, measurements, projection, effects, in, the, bulge, disk, interface, region, and, the, random, motions, of, stars, affecting, the, true, rotational, velocities, these, effects, make, kinematic, measurements, of, lenticular, galaxies, considerably, more, difficult, compared, to, normal, disk, galaxies, the, kinematic, connection, between, spiral, and, lenticular, galaxies, is, most, clear, when, analyzing, the, tully, fisher, relation, for, spiral, and, lenticular, samples, if, lenticular, galaxies, are, an, evolved, stage, of, spiral, galaxies, then, they, should, have, a, similar, tully, fisher, relation, with, spirals, but, with, an, offset, in, the, luminosity, absolute, magnitude, axis, this, would, result, from, brighter, redder, stars, dominating, the, stellar, populations, of, lenticulars, an, example, of, this, effect, can, be, seen, in, the, adjacent, plot, one, can, clearly, see, that, the, best, fit, lines, for, the, spiral, galaxy, data, and, the, lenticular, galaxy, have, the, same, slope, and, thus, follow, the, same, tully, fisher, relation, but, are, offset, by, i, 1, 5, this, implies, that, lenticular, galaxies, were, once, spiral, galaxies, but, are, now, dominated, by, old, red, stars, the, morphology, and, kinematics, of, lenticular, galaxies, each, to, a, degree, suggest, a, mode, of, galaxy, formation, their, disk, like, possibly, dusty, appearance, suggests, they, come, from, faded, spiral, galaxies, whose, arm, features, disappeared, however, some, lenticular, galaxies, are, more, luminous, than, spiral, galaxies, which, suggests, that, they, are, not, merely, the, faded, remnants, of, spiral, galaxies, lenticular, galaxies, might, result, from, a, galaxy, merger, which, increase, the, total, stellar, mass, and, might, give, the, newly, merged, galaxy, a, disk, like, arm, less, appearance, alternatively, it, has, been, proposed, that, they, grew, their, disks, via, gas, and, minor, merger, accretion, events, it, had, previously, been, suggested, that, the, evolution, of, luminous, lenticular, galaxies, may, be, closely, linked, to, that, of, elliptical, galaxies, whereas, fainter, lenticulars, might, be, more, closely, associated, with, ram, pressure, stripped, spiral, galaxies, although, this, latter, galaxy, harassment, scenario, has, since, been, queried, due, to, the, existence, of, extremely, isolated, low, luminosity, lenticular, galaxies, such, as, leda, 2108986, the, absence, of, gas, presence, of, dust, lack, of, recent, star, formation, and, rotational, support, are, all, attributes, one, might, expect, of, a, spiral, galaxy, which, had, used, up, all, of, its, gas, in, the, formation, of, stars, this, possibility, is, further, enhanced, by, the, existence, of, gas, poor, or, anemic, spiral, galaxies, if, the, spiral, pattern, then, dissipated, the, resulting, galaxy, would, be, similar, to, many, lenticulars, moore, et, al, also, document, that, tidal, harassment, the, gravitational, effects, from, other, near, by, galaxies, could, aid, this, process, in, dense, regions, the, clearest, support, for, this, theory, however, is, their, adherence, to, slightly, shifted, version, of, tully, fisher, relation, discussed, above, a, 2012, paper, that, suggests, a, new, classification, system, first, proposed, by, the, canadian, astronomer, sidney, van, den, bergh, for, lenticular, and, dwarf, spheroidal, galaxies, s0a, s0b, s0c, dsph, that, parallels, the, hubble, sequence, for, spirals, and, irregulars, sa, sb, sc, im, reinforces, this, idea, showing, how, the, spiral, irregular, sequence, is, very, similar, to, this, new, one, for, lenticulars, and, dwarf, ellipticals, the, analyses, of, burstein, and, sandage, showed, that, lenticular, galaxies, typically, have, surface, brightness, much, greater, than, other, spiral, classes, it, is, also, thought, that, lenticular, galaxies, exhibit, a, larger, bulge, to, disk, ratio, than, spiral, galaxies, and, this, may, be, inconsistent, with, simple, fading, from, a, spiral, if, s0s, were, formed, by, mergers, of, other, spirals, these, observations, would, be, fitting, and, it, would, also, account, for, the, increased, frequency, of, globular, clusters, it, should, be, mentioned, however, that, advanced, models, of, the, central, bulge, which, include, both, a, general, sersic, profile, and, bar, indicate, a, smaller, bulge, and, thus, a, lessened, inconsistency, mergers, are, also, unable, to, account, for, the, offset, from, the, tully, fisher, relation, without, assuming, that, the, merged, galaxies, were, quite, different, from, those, we, see, today, the, creation, of, disks, in, at, least, some, lenticular, galaxies, via, the, accretion, of, gas, and, small, galaxies, around, a, pre, existing, spheroidal, structure, was, first, suggested, as, an, explanation, to, match, the, high, redshift, compact, massive, spheroidal, shaped, galaxies, with, the, equally, compact, massive, bulges, seen, in, nearby, massive, lenticular, galaxies, in, a, downsizing, scenario, bigger, lenticular, galaxies, may, have, been, built, first, in, a, younger, universe, when, more, gas, was, available, and, the, lower, mass, galaxies, may, have, been, slower, to, attract, their, disk, building, material, as, in, the, case, of, the, isolated, early, type, galaxy, leda, 2108986, within, galaxy, clusters, ram, pressure, stripping, removes, gas, and, prevents, the, accretion, of, new, gas, that, might, be, capable, of, furthering, the, development, of, the, disk
