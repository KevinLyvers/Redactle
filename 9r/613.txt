earth, s, magnetic, field, also, known, as, the, geomagnetic, field, is, the, magnetic, field, that, extends, from, earth, s, interior, out, into, space, where, it, interacts, with, the, solar, wind, a, stream, of, charged, particles, emanating, from, the, sun, the, magnetic, field, is, generated, by, electric, currents, due, to, the, motion, of, convection, currents, of, a, mixture, of, molten, iron, and, nickel, in, earth, s, outer, core, these, convection, currents, are, caused, by, heat, escaping, from, the, core, a, natural, process, called, a, geodynamo, the, magnitude, of, earth, s, magnetic, field, at, its, surface, ranges, from, 25, to, 65, t, 0, 25, to, 0, 65, g, as, an, approximation, it, is, represented, by, a, field, of, a, magnetic, dipole, currently, tilted, at, an, angle, of, about, 11, with, respect, to, earth, s, rotational, axis, as, if, there, were, an, enormous, bar, magnet, placed, at, that, angle, through, the, center, of, earth, the, north, geomagnetic, pole, actually, represents, the, south, pole, of, earth, s, magnetic, field, and, conversely, the, south, geomagnetic, pole, corresponds, to, the, north, pole, of, earth, s, magnetic, field, because, opposite, magnetic, poles, attract, and, the, north, end, of, a, magnet, like, a, compass, needle, points, toward, earth, s, south, magnetic, field, ellesmere, island, nunavut, canada, while, the, north, and, south, magnetic, poles, are, usually, located, near, the, geographic, poles, they, slowly, and, continuously, move, over, geological, time, scales, but, sufficiently, slowly, for, ordinary, compasses, to, remain, useful, for, navigation, however, at, irregular, intervals, averaging, several, hundred, thousand, years, earth, s, field, reverses, and, the, north, and, south, magnetic, poles, respectively, abruptly, switch, places, these, reversals, of, the, geomagnetic, poles, leave, a, record, in, rocks, that, are, of, value, to, paleomagnetists, in, calculating, geomagnetic, fields, in, the, past, such, information, in, turn, is, helpful, in, studying, the, motions, of, continents, and, ocean, floors, the, magnetosphere, extends, above, the, ionosphere, that, is, defined, by, the, extent, of, earth, s, magnetic, field, in, space, or, geospace, it, extends, several, tens, of, thousands, of, kilometres, into, space, protecting, earth, from, the, charged, particles, of, the, solar, wind, and, cosmic, rays, that, would, otherwise, strip, away, the, upper, atmosphere, including, the, ozone, layer, that, protects, earth, from, harmful, ultraviolet, radiation, earth, s, magnetic, field, deflects, most, of, the, solar, wind, whose, charged, particles, would, otherwise, strip, away, the, ozone, layer, that, protects, the, earth, from, harmful, ultraviolet, radiation, one, stripping, mechanism, is, for, gas, to, be, caught, in, bubbles, of, the, magnetic, field, which, are, ripped, off, by, solar, winds, calculations, of, the, loss, of, carbon, dioxide, from, the, atmosphere, of, mars, resulting, from, scavenging, of, ions, by, the, solar, wind, indicate, that, the, dissipation, of, the, magnetic, field, of, mars, caused, a, near, total, loss, of, its, atmosphere, the, study, of, the, past, magnetic, field, of, the, earth, is, known, as, paleomagnetism, the, polarity, of, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, is, recorded, in, igneous, rocks, and, reversals, of, the, field, are, thus, detectable, as, stripes, centered, on, mid, ocean, ridges, where, the, sea, floor, is, spreading, while, the, stability, of, the, geomagnetic, poles, between, reversals, has, allowed, paleomagnetism, to, track, the, past, motion, of, continents, reversals, also, provide, the, basis, for, magnetostratigraphy, a, way, of, dating, rocks, and, sediments, the, field, also, magnetizes, the, crust, and, magnetic, anomalies, can, be, used, to, search, for, deposits, of, metal, ores, humans, have, used, compasses, for, direction, finding, since, the, 11th, century, a, d, and, for, navigation, since, the, 12th, century, although, the, magnetic, declination, does, shift, with, time, this, wandering, is, slow, enough, that, a, simple, compass, can, remain, useful, for, navigation, using, magnetoreception, various, other, organisms, ranging, from, some, types, of, bacteria, to, pigeons, use, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, for, orientation, and, navigation, at, any, location, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, can, be, represented, by, a, three, dimensional, vector, a, typical, procedure, for, measuring, its, direction, is, to, use, a, compass, to, determine, the, direction, of, magnetic, north, its, angle, relative, to, true, north, is, the, declination, d, or, variation, facing, magnetic, north, the, angle, the, field, makes, with, the, horizontal, is, the, inclination, i, or, magnetic, dip, the, intensity, f, of, the, field, is, proportional, to, the, force, it, exerts, on, a, magnet, another, common, representation, is, in, x, north, y, east, and, z, down, coordinates, the, intensity, of, the, field, is, often, measured, in, gauss, g, but, is, generally, reported, in, microteslas, t, with, 1, g, 100, t, a, nanotesla, is, also, referred, to, as, a, gamma, the, earth, s, field, ranges, between, approximately, 22, and, 67, t, 0, 22, and, 0, 67, g, by, comparison, a, strong, refrigerator, magnet, has, a, field, of, about, 10, 000, t, 100, g, a, map, of, intensity, contours, is, called, an, isodynamic, chart, as, the, world, magnetic, model, shows, the, intensity, tends, to, decrease, from, the, poles, to, the, equator, a, minimum, intensity, occurs, in, the, south, atlantic, anomaly, over, south, america, while, there, are, maxima, over, northern, canada, siberia, and, the, coast, of, antarctica, south, of, australia, the, intensity, of, the, magnetic, field, is, subject, to, change, over, time, a, 2021, paleomagnetic, study, from, the, university, of, liverpool, contributed, to, a, growing, body, of, evidence, that, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, cycles, with, intensity, every, 200, million, years, the, lead, author, stated, that, our, findings, when, considered, alongside, the, existing, datasets, support, the, existence, of, an, approximately, 200, million, year, long, cycle, in, the, strength, of, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, related, to, deep, earth, processes, the, inclination, is, given, by, an, angle, that, can, assume, values, between, 90, up, to, 90, down, in, the, northern, hemisphere, the, field, points, downwards, it, is, straight, down, at, the, north, magnetic, pole, and, rotates, upwards, as, the, latitude, decreases, until, it, is, horizontal, 0, at, the, magnetic, equator, it, continues, to, rotate, upwards, until, it, is, straight, up, at, the, south, magnetic, pole, inclination, can, be, measured, with, a, dip, circle, an, isoclinic, chart, map, of, inclination, contours, for, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, is, shown, below, declination, is, positive, for, an, eastward, deviation, of, the, field, relative, to, true, north, it, can, be, estimated, by, comparing, the, magnetic, north, south, heading, on, a, compass, with, the, direction, of, a, celestial, pole, maps, typically, include, information, on, the, declination, as, an, angle, or, a, small, diagram, showing, the, relationship, between, magnetic, north, and, true, north, information, on, declination, for, a, region, can, be, represented, by, a, chart, with, isogonic, lines, contour, lines, with, each, line, representing, a, fixed, declination, components, of, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, at, the, surface, from, the, world, magnetic, model, for, 2020, near, the, surface, of, the, earth, its, magnetic, field, can, be, closely, approximated, by, the, field, of, a, magnetic, dipole, positioned, at, the, center, of, the, earth, and, tilted, at, an, angle, of, about, 11, with, respect, to, the, rotational, axis, of, the, earth, the, dipole, is, roughly, equivalent, to, a, powerful, bar, magnet, with, its, south, pole, pointing, towards, the, geomagnetic, north, pole, this, may, seem, surprising, but, the, north, pole, of, a, magnet, is, so, defined, because, if, allowed, to, rotate, freely, it, points, roughly, northward, in, the, geographic, sense, since, the, north, pole, of, a, magnet, attracts, the, south, poles, of, other, magnets, and, repels, the, north, poles, it, must, be, attracted, to, the, south, pole, of, earth, s, magnet, the, dipolar, field, accounts, for, 80, 90, of, the, field, in, most, locations, historically, the, north, and, south, poles, of, a, magnet, were, first, defined, by, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, not, vice, versa, since, one, of, the, first, uses, for, a, magnet, was, as, a, compass, needle, a, magnet, s, north, pole, is, defined, as, the, pole, that, is, attracted, by, the, earth, s, north, magnetic, pole, when, the, magnet, is, suspended, so, it, can, turn, freely, since, opposite, poles, attract, the, north, magnetic, pole, of, the, earth, is, really, the, south, pole, of, its, magnetic, field, the, place, where, the, field, is, directed, downward, into, the, earth, the, positions, of, the, magnetic, poles, can, be, defined, in, at, least, two, ways, locally, or, globally, the, local, definition, is, the, point, where, the, magnetic, field, is, vertical, this, can, be, determined, by, measuring, the, inclination, the, inclination, of, the, earth, s, field, is, 90, downwards, at, the, north, magnetic, pole, and, 90, upwards, at, the, south, magnetic, pole, the, two, poles, wander, independently, of, each, other, and, are, not, directly, opposite, each, other, on, the, globe, movements, of, up, to, 40, kilometres, 25, mi, per, year, have, been, observed, for, the, north, magnetic, pole, over, the, last, 180, years, the, north, magnetic, pole, has, been, migrating, northwestward, from, cape, adelaide, in, the, boothia, peninsula, in, 1831, to, 600, kilometres, 370, mi, from, resolute, bay, in, 2001, the, magnetic, equator, is, the, line, where, the, inclination, is, zero, the, magnetic, field, is, horizontal, the, global, definition, of, the, earth, s, field, is, based, on, a, mathematical, model, if, a, line, is, drawn, through, the, center, of, the, earth, parallel, to, the, moment, of, the, best, fitting, magnetic, dipole, the, two, positions, where, it, intersects, the, earth, s, surface, are, called, the, north, and, south, geomagnetic, poles, if, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, were, perfectly, dipolar, the, geomagnetic, poles, and, magnetic, dip, poles, would, coincide, and, compasses, would, point, towards, them, however, the, earth, s, field, has, a, significant, non, dipolar, contribution, so, the, poles, do, not, coincide, and, compasses, do, not, generally, point, at, either, earth, s, magnetic, field, predominantly, dipolar, at, its, surface, is, distorted, further, out, by, the, solar, wind, this, is, a, stream, of, charged, particles, leaving, the, sun, s, corona, and, accelerating, to, a, speed, of, 200, to, 1000, kilometres, per, second, they, carry, with, them, a, magnetic, field, the, interplanetary, magnetic, field, imf, the, solar, wind, exerts, a, pressure, and, if, it, could, reach, earth, s, atmosphere, it, would, erode, it, however, it, is, kept, away, by, the, pressure, of, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, the, magnetopause, the, area, where, the, pressures, balance, is, the, boundary, of, the, magnetosphere, despite, its, name, the, magnetosphere, is, asymmetric, with, the, sunward, side, being, about, 10, earth, radii, out, but, the, other, side, stretching, out, in, a, magnetotail, that, extends, beyond, 200, earth, radii, sunward, of, the, magnetopause, is, the, bow, shock, the, area, where, the, solar, wind, slows, abruptly, inside, the, magnetosphere, is, the, plasmasphere, a, donut, shaped, region, containing, low, energy, charged, particles, or, plasma, this, region, begins, at, a, height, of, 60, km, extends, up, to, 3, or, 4, earth, radii, and, includes, the, ionosphere, this, region, rotates, with, the, earth, there, are, also, two, concentric, tire, shaped, regions, called, the, van, allen, radiation, belts, with, high, energy, ions, energies, from, 0, 1, to, 10, mev, the, inner, belt, is, 1, 2, earth, radii, out, while, the, outer, belt, is, at, 4, 7, earth, radii, the, plasmasphere, and, van, allen, belts, have, partial, overlap, with, the, extent, of, overlap, varying, greatly, with, solar, activity, as, well, as, deflecting, the, solar, wind, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, deflects, cosmic, rays, high, energy, charged, particles, that, are, mostly, from, outside, the, solar, system, many, cosmic, rays, are, kept, out, of, the, solar, system, by, the, sun, s, magnetosphere, or, heliosphere, by, contrast, astronauts, on, the, moon, risk, exposure, to, radiation, anyone, who, had, been, on, the, moon, s, surface, during, a, particularly, violent, solar, eruption, in, 2005, would, have, received, a, lethal, dose, some, of, the, charged, particles, do, get, into, the, magnetosphere, these, spiral, around, field, lines, bouncing, back, and, forth, between, the, poles, several, times, per, second, in, addition, positive, ions, slowly, drift, westward, and, negative, ions, drift, eastward, giving, rise, to, a, ring, current, this, current, reduces, the, magnetic, field, at, the, earth, s, surface, particles, that, penetrate, the, ionosphere, and, collide, with, the, atoms, there, give, rise, to, the, lights, of, the, aurorae, while, also, emitting, x, rays, the, varying, conditions, in, the, magnetosphere, known, as, space, weather, are, largely, driven, by, solar, activity, if, the, solar, wind, is, weak, the, magnetosphere, expands, while, if, it, is, strong, it, compresses, the, magnetosphere, and, more, of, it, gets, in, periods, of, particularly, intense, activity, called, geomagnetic, storms, can, occur, when, a, coronal, mass, ejection, erupts, above, the, sun, and, sends, a, shock, wave, through, the, solar, system, such, a, wave, can, take, just, two, days, to, reach, the, earth, geomagnetic, storms, can, cause, a, lot, of, disruption, the, halloween, storm, of, 2003, damaged, more, than, a, third, of, nasa, s, satellites, the, largest, documented, storm, the, carrington, event, occurred, in, 1859, it, induced, currents, strong, enough, to, disrupt, telegraph, lines, and, aurorae, were, reported, as, far, south, as, hawaii, the, geomagnetic, field, changes, on, time, scales, from, milliseconds, to, millions, of, years, shorter, time, scales, mostly, arise, from, currents, in, the, ionosphere, ionospheric, dynamo, region, and, magnetosphere, and, some, changes, can, be, traced, to, geomagnetic, storms, or, daily, variations, in, currents, changes, over, time, scales, of, a, year, or, more, mostly, reflect, changes, in, the, earth, s, interior, particularly, the, iron, rich, core, frequently, the, earth, s, magnetosphere, is, hit, by, solar, flares, causing, geomagnetic, storms, provoking, displays, of, aurorae, the, short, term, instability, of, the, magnetic, field, is, measured, with, the, k, index, data, from, themis, show, that, the, magnetic, field, which, interacts, with, the, solar, wind, is, reduced, when, the, magnetic, orientation, is, aligned, between, sun, and, earth, opposite, to, the, previous, hypothesis, during, forthcoming, solar, storms, this, could, result, in, blackouts, and, disruptions, in, artificial, satellites, changes, in, earth, s, magnetic, field, on, a, time, scale, of, a, year, or, more, are, referred, to, as, secular, variation, over, hundreds, of, years, magnetic, declination, is, observed, to, vary, over, tens, of, degrees, the, animation, shows, how, global, declinations, have, changed, over, the, last, few, centuries, the, direction, and, intensity, of, the, dipole, change, over, time, over, the, last, two, centuries, the, dipole, strength, has, been, decreasing, at, a, rate, of, about, 6, 3, per, century, at, this, rate, of, decrease, the, field, would, be, negligible, in, about, 1600, years, however, this, strength, is, about, average, for, the, last, 7, thousand, years, and, the, current, rate, of, change, is, not, unusual, a, prominent, feature, in, the, non, dipolar, part, of, the, secular, variation, is, a, westward, drift, at, a, rate, of, about, 0, 2, per, year, this, drift, is, not, the, same, everywhere, and, has, varied, over, time, the, globally, averaged, drift, has, been, westward, since, about, 1400, ad, but, eastward, between, about, 1000, ad, and, 1400, ad, changes, that, predate, magnetic, observatories, are, recorded, in, archaeological, and, geological, materials, such, changes, are, referred, to, as, paleomagnetic, secular, variation, or, paleosecular, variation, psv, the, records, typically, include, long, periods, of, small, change, with, occasional, large, changes, reflecting, geomagnetic, excursions, and, reversals, a, 1995, study, of, lava, flows, on, steens, mountain, oregon, appeared, to, suggest, the, magnetic, field, once, shifted, at, a, rate, of, up, to, 6, per, day, at, some, time, in, earth, s, history, a, surprising, result, however, in, 2014, one, of, the, original, authors, published, a, new, study, which, found, the, results, were, actually, due, to, the, continuous, thermal, demagnitization, of, the, lava, not, to, a, shift, in, the, magnetic, field, in, july, 2020, scientists, report, that, analysis, of, simulations, and, a, recent, observational, field, model, show, that, maximum, rates, of, directional, change, of, earth, s, magnetic, field, reached, 10, per, year, almost, 100, times, faster, than, current, changes, and, 10, times, faster, than, previously, thought, although, generally, earth, s, field, is, approximately, dipolar, with, an, axis, that, is, nearly, aligned, with, the, rotational, axis, occasionally, the, north, and, south, geomagnetic, poles, trade, places, evidence, for, these, geomagnetic, reversals, can, be, found, in, basalts, sediment, cores, taken, from, the, ocean, floors, and, seafloor, magnetic, anomalies, reversals, occur, nearly, randomly, in, time, with, intervals, between, reversals, ranging, from, less, than, 0, 1, million, years, to, as, much, as, 50, million, years, the, most, recent, geomagnetic, reversal, called, the, brunhes, matuyama, reversal, occurred, about, 780, 000, years, ago, a, related, phenomenon, a, geomagnetic, excursion, takes, the, dipole, axis, across, the, equator, and, then, back, to, the, original, polarity, the, laschamp, event, is, an, example, of, an, excursion, occurring, during, the, last, ice, age, 41, 000, years, ago, the, past, magnetic, field, is, recorded, mostly, by, strongly, magnetic, minerals, particularly, iron, oxides, such, as, magnetite, that, can, carry, a, permanent, magnetic, moment, this, remanent, magnetization, or, remanence, can, be, acquired, in, more, than, one, way, in, lava, flows, the, direction, of, the, field, is, frozen, in, small, minerals, as, they, cool, giving, rise, to, a, thermoremanent, magnetization, in, sediments, the, orientation, of, magnetic, particles, acquires, a, slight, bias, towards, the, magnetic, field, as, they, are, deposited, on, an, ocean, floor, or, lake, bottom, this, is, called, detrital, remanent, magnetization, thermoremanent, magnetization, is, the, main, source, of, the, magnetic, anomalies, around, mid, ocean, ridges, as, the, seafloor, spreads, magma, wells, up, from, the, mantle, cools, to, form, new, basaltic, crust, on, both, sides, of, the, ridge, and, is, carried, away, from, it, by, seafloor, spreading, as, it, cools, it, records, the, direction, of, the, earth, s, field, when, the, earth, s, field, reverses, new, basalt, records, the, reversed, direction, the, result, is, a, series, of, stripes, that, are, symmetric, about, the, ridge, a, ship, towing, a, magnetometer, on, the, surface, of, the, ocean, can, detect, these, stripes, and, infer, the, age, of, the, ocean, floor, below, this, provides, information, on, the, rate, at, which, seafloor, has, spread, in, the, past, radiometric, dating, of, lava, flows, has, been, used, to, establish, a, geomagnetic, polarity, time, scale, part, of, which, is, shown, in, the, image, this, forms, the, basis, of, magnetostratigraphy, a, geophysical, correlation, technique, that, can, be, used, to, date, both, sedimentary, and, volcanic, sequences, as, well, as, the, seafloor, magnetic, anomalies, paleomagnetic, studies, of, paleoarchean, lava, in, australia, and, conglomerate, in, south, africa, have, concluded, that, the, magnetic, field, has, been, present, since, at, least, about, 3, 450, million, years, ago, in, 2024, researchers, published, evidence, from, greenland, for, the, existence, of, the, magnetic, field, as, early, as, 3, 700, million, years, ago, starting, in, the, late, 1800s, and, throughout, the, 1900s, and, later, the, overall, geomagnetic, field, has, become, weaker, the, present, strong, deterioration, corresponds, to, a, 10, 15, decline, and, has, accelerated, since, 2000, geomagnetic, intensity, has, declined, almost, continuously, from, a, maximum, 35, above, the, modern, value, from, circa, year, 1, ad, the, rate, of, decrease, and, the, current, strength, are, within, the, normal, range, of, variation, as, shown, by, the, record, of, past, magnetic, fields, recorded, in, rocks, the, nature, of, earth, s, magnetic, field, is, one, of, heteroscedastic, seemingly, random, fluctuation, an, instantaneous, measurement, of, it, or, several, measurements, of, it, across, the, span, of, decades, or, centuries, are, not, sufficient, to, extrapolate, an, overall, trend, in, the, field, strength, it, has, gone, up, and, down, in, the, past, for, unknown, reasons, also, noting, the, local, intensity, of, the, dipole, field, or, its, fluctuation, is, insufficient, to, characterize, earth, s, magnetic, field, as, a, whole, as, it, is, not, strictly, a, dipole, field, the, dipole, component, of, earth, s, field, can, diminish, even, while, the, total, magnetic, field, remains, the, same, or, increases, the, earth, s, magnetic, north, pole, is, drifting, from, northern, canada, towards, siberia, with, a, presently, accelerating, rate, 10, kilometres, 6, 2, mi, per, year, at, the, beginning, of, the, 1900s, up, to, 40, kilometres, 25, mi, per, year, in, 2003, and, since, then, has, only, accelerated, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, is, believed, to, be, generated, by, electric, currents, in, the, conductive, iron, alloys, of, its, core, created, by, convection, currents, due, to, heat, escaping, from, the, core, the, earth, and, most, of, the, planets, in, the, solar, system, as, well, as, the, sun, and, other, stars, all, generate, magnetic, fields, through, the, motion, of, electrically, conducting, fluids, the, earth, s, field, originates, in, its, core, this, is, a, region, of, iron, alloys, extending, to, about, 3400, km, the, radius, of, the, earth, is, 6370, km, it, is, divided, into, a, solid, inner, core, with, a, radius, of, 1220, km, and, a, liquid, outer, core, the, motion, of, the, liquid, in, the, outer, core, is, driven, by, heat, flow, from, the, inner, core, which, is, about, 6, 000, k, 5, 730, c, 10, 340, f, to, the, core, mantle, boundary, which, is, about, 3, 800, k, 3, 530, c, 6, 380, f, the, heat, is, generated, by, potential, energy, released, by, heavier, materials, sinking, toward, the, core, planetary, differentiation, the, iron, catastrophe, as, well, as, decay, of, radioactive, elements, in, the, interior, the, pattern, of, flow, is, organized, by, the, rotation, of, the, earth, and, the, presence, of, the, solid, inner, core, the, mechanism, by, which, the, earth, generates, a, magnetic, field, is, known, as, a, geodynamo, the, magnetic, field, is, generated, by, a, feedback, loop, current, loops, generate, magnetic, fields, amp, re, s, circuital, law, a, changing, magnetic, field, generates, an, electric, field, faraday, s, law, and, the, electric, and, magnetic, fields, exert, a, force, on, the, charges, that, are, flowing, in, currents, the, lorentz, force, these, effects, can, be, combined, in, a, partial, differential, equation, for, the, magnetic, field, called, the, magnetic, induction, equation, where, u, is, the, velocity, of, the, fluid, b, is, the, magnetic, b, field, and, 1, is, the, magnetic, diffusivity, which, is, inversely, proportional, to, the, product, of, the, electrical, conductivity, and, the, permeability, the, term, b, t, is, the, time, derivative, of, the, field, 2, is, the, laplace, operator, and, is, the, curl, operator, the, first, term, on, the, right, hand, side, of, the, induction, equation, is, a, diffusion, term, in, a, stationary, fluid, the, magnetic, field, declines, and, any, concentrations, of, field, spread, out, if, the, earth, s, dynamo, shut, off, the, dipole, part, would, disappear, in, a, few, tens, of, thousands, of, years, in, a, perfect, conductor, displaystyle, sigma, infty, there, would, be, no, diffusion, by, lenz, s, law, any, change, in, the, magnetic, field, would, be, immediately, opposed, by, currents, so, the, flux, through, a, given, volume, of, fluid, could, not, change, as, the, fluid, moved, the, magnetic, field, would, go, with, it, the, theorem, describing, this, effect, is, called, the, frozen, in, field, theorem, even, in, a, fluid, with, a, finite, conductivity, new, field, is, generated, by, stretching, field, lines, as, the, fluid, moves, in, ways, that, deform, it, this, process, could, go, on, generating, new, field, indefinitely, were, it, not, that, as, the, magnetic, field, increases, in, strength, it, resists, fluid, motion, the, motion, of, the, fluid, is, sustained, by, convection, motion, driven, by, buoyancy, the, temperature, increases, towards, the, center, of, the, earth, and, the, higher, temperature, of, the, fluid, lower, down, makes, it, buoyant, this, buoyancy, is, enhanced, by, chemical, separation, as, the, core, cools, some, of, the, molten, iron, solidifies, and, is, plated, to, the, inner, core, in, the, process, lighter, elements, are, left, behind, in, the, fluid, making, it, lighter, this, is, called, compositional, convection, a, coriolis, effect, caused, by, the, overall, planetary, rotation, tends, to, organize, the, flow, into, rolls, aligned, along, the, north, south, polar, axis, a, dynamo, can, amplify, a, magnetic, field, but, it, needs, a, seed, field, to, get, it, started, for, the, earth, this, could, have, been, an, external, magnetic, field, early, in, its, history, the, sun, went, through, a, t, tauri, phase, in, which, the, solar, wind, would, have, had, a, magnetic, field, orders, of, magnitude, larger, than, the, present, solar, wind, however, much, of, the, field, may, have, been, screened, out, by, the, earth, s, mantle, an, alternative, source, is, currents, in, the, core, mantle, boundary, driven, by, chemical, reactions, or, variations, in, thermal, or, electric, conductivity, such, effects, may, still, provide, a, small, bias, that, are, part, of, the, boundary, conditions, for, the, geodynamo, the, average, magnetic, field, in, the, earth, s, outer, core, was, calculated, to, be, 25, gauss, 50, times, stronger, than, the, field, at, the, surface, simulating, the, geodynamo, by, computer, requires, numerically, solving, a, set, of, nonlinear, partial, differential, equations, for, the, magnetohydrodynamics, mhd, of, the, earth, s, interior, simulation, of, the, mhd, equations, is, performed, on, a, 3d, grid, of, points, and, the, fineness, of, the, grid, which, in, part, determines, the, realism, of, the, solutions, is, limited, mainly, by, computer, power, for, decades, theorists, were, confined, to, creating, kinematic, dynamo, computer, models, in, which, the, fluid, motion, is, chosen, in, advance, and, the, effect, on, the, magnetic, field, calculated, kinematic, dynamo, theory, was, mainly, a, matter, of, trying, different, flow, geometries, and, testing, whether, such, geometries, could, sustain, a, dynamo, the, first, self, consistent, dynamo, models, ones, that, determine, both, the, fluid, motions, and, the, magnetic, field, were, developed, by, two, groups, in, 1995, one, in, japan, and, one, in, the, united, states, the, latter, received, attention, because, it, successfully, reproduced, some, of, the, characteristics, of, the, earth, s, field, including, geomagnetic, reversals, the, oceans, contribute, to, earth, s, magnetic, field, seawater, is, an, electrical, conductor, and, therefore, interacts, with, the, magnetic, field, as, the, tides, cycle, around, the, ocean, basins, the, ocean, water, essentially, tries, to, pull, the, geomagnetic, field, lines, along, because, the, salty, water, is, only, slightly, conductive, the, interaction, is, relatively, weak, the, strongest, component, is, from, the, regular, lunar, tide, that, happens, about, twice, per, day, m2, other, contributions, come, from, ocean, swell, eddies, and, even, tsunamis, the, strength, of, the, interaction, depends, also, on, the, temperature, of, the, ocean, water, the, entire, heat, stored, in, the, ocean, can, now, be, inferred, from, observations, of, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, electric, currents, induced, in, the, ionosphere, generate, magnetic, fields, ionospheric, dynamo, region, such, a, field, is, always, generated, near, where, the, atmosphere, is, closest, to, the, sun, causing, daily, alterations, that, can, deflect, surface, magnetic, fields, by, as, much, as, 1, typical, daily, variations, of, field, strength, are, about, 25, nt, one, part, in, 2000, with, variations, over, a, few, seconds, of, typically, around, 1, nt, one, part, in, 50, 000, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, strength, was, measured, by, carl, friedrich, gauss, in, 1832, and, has, been, repeatedly, measured, since, then, showing, a, relative, decay, of, about, 10, over, the, last, 150, years, the, magsat, satellite, and, later, satellites, have, used, 3, axis, vector, magnetometers, to, probe, the, 3, d, structure, of, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, the, later, rsted, satellite, allowed, a, comparison, indicating, a, dynamic, geodynamo, in, action, that, appears, to, be, giving, rise, to, an, alternate, pole, under, the, atlantic, ocean, west, of, south, africa, governments, sometimes, operate, units, that, specialize, in, measurement, of, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, these, are, geomagnetic, observatories, typically, part, of, a, national, geological, survey, for, example, the, british, geological, survey, s, eskdalemuir, observatory, such, observatories, can, measure, and, forecast, magnetic, conditions, such, as, magnetic, storms, that, sometimes, affect, communications, electric, power, and, other, human, activities, the, international, real, time, magnetic, observatory, network, with, over, 100, interlinked, geomagnetic, observatories, around, the, world, has, been, recording, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, since, 1991, the, military, determines, local, geomagnetic, field, characteristics, in, order, to, detect, anomalies, in, the, natural, background, that, might, be, caused, by, a, significant, metallic, object, such, as, a, submerged, submarine, typically, these, magnetic, anomaly, detectors, are, flown, in, aircraft, like, the, uk, s, nimrod, or, towed, as, an, instrument, or, an, array, of, instruments, from, surface, ships, commercially, geophysical, prospecting, companies, also, use, magnetic, detectors, to, identify, naturally, occurring, anomalies, from, ore, bodies, such, as, the, kursk, magnetic, anomaly, magnetometers, detect, minute, deviations, in, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, caused, by, iron, artifacts, kilns, some, types, of, stone, structures, and, even, ditches, and, middens, in, archaeological, geophysics, using, magnetic, instruments, adapted, from, airborne, magnetic, anomaly, detectors, developed, during, world, war, ii, to, detect, submarines, the, magnetic, variations, across, the, ocean, floor, have, been, mapped, basalt, the, iron, rich, volcanic, rock, making, up, the, ocean, floor, contains, a, strongly, magnetic, mineral, magnetite, and, can, locally, distort, compass, readings, the, distortion, was, recognized, by, icelandic, mariners, as, early, as, the, late, 18th, century, more, important, because, the, presence, of, magnetite, gives, the, basalt, measurable, magnetic, properties, these, magnetic, variations, have, provided, another, means, to, study, the, deep, ocean, floor, when, newly, formed, rock, cools, such, magnetic, materials, record, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, each, measurement, of, the, magnetic, field, is, at, a, particular, place, and, time, if, an, accurate, estimate, of, the, field, at, some, other, place, and, time, is, needed, the, measurements, must, be, converted, to, a, model, and, the, model, used, to, make, predictions, the, most, common, way, of, analyzing, the, global, variations, in, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, is, to, fit, the, measurements, to, a, set, of, spherical, harmonics, this, was, first, done, by, carl, friedrich, gauss, spherical, harmonics, are, functions, that, oscillate, over, the, surface, of, a, sphere, they, are, the, product, of, two, functions, one, that, depends, on, latitude, and, one, on, longitude, the, function, of, longitude, is, zero, along, zero, or, more, great, circles, passing, through, the, north, and, south, poles, the, number, of, such, nodal, lines, is, the, absolute, value, of, the, order, m, the, function, of, latitude, is, zero, along, zero, or, more, latitude, circles, this, plus, the, order, is, equal, to, the, degree, each, harmonic, is, equivalent, to, a, particular, arrangement, of, magnetic, charges, at, the, center, of, the, earth, a, monopole, is, an, isolated, magnetic, charge, which, has, never, been, observed, a, dipole, is, equivalent, to, two, opposing, charges, brought, close, together, and, a, quadrupole, to, two, dipoles, brought, together, a, quadrupole, field, is, shown, in, the, lower, figure, on, the, right, spherical, harmonics, can, represent, any, scalar, field, function, of, position, that, satisfies, certain, properties, a, magnetic, field, is, a, vector, field, but, if, it, is, expressed, in, cartesian, components, x, y, z, each, component, is, the, derivative, of, the, same, scalar, function, called, the, magnetic, potential, analyses, of, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, use, a, modified, version, of, the, usual, spherical, harmonics, that, differ, by, a, multiplicative, factor, a, least, squares, fit, to, the, magnetic, field, measurements, gives, the, earth, s, field, as, the, sum, of, spherical, harmonics, each, multiplied, by, the, best, fitting, gauss, coefficient, g, m, or, h, m, the, lowest, degree, gauss, coefficient, g, 0, 0, gives, the, contribution, of, an, isolated, magnetic, charge, so, it, is, zero, the, next, three, coefficients, g, 1, 0, g, 1, 1, and, h, 1, 1, determine, the, direction, and, magnitude, of, the, dipole, contribution, the, best, fitting, dipole, is, tilted, at, an, angle, of, about, 10, with, respect, to, the, rotational, axis, as, described, earlier, spherical, harmonic, analysis, can, be, used, to, distinguish, internal, from, external, sources, if, measurements, are, available, at, more, than, one, height, for, example, ground, observatories, and, satellites, in, that, case, each, term, with, coefficient, g, m, or, h, m, can, be, split, into, two, terms, one, that, decreases, with, radius, as, 1, r, 1, and, one, that, increases, with, radius, as, r, the, increasing, terms, fit, the, external, sources, currents, in, the, ionosphere, and, magnetosphere, however, averaged, over, a, few, years, the, external, contributions, average, to, zero, the, remaining, terms, predict, that, the, potential, of, a, dipole, source, 1, drops, off, as, 1, r, 2, the, magnetic, field, being, a, derivative, of, the, potential, drops, off, as, 1, r, 3, quadrupole, terms, drop, off, as, 1, r, 4, and, higher, order, terms, drop, off, increasingly, rapidly, with, the, radius, the, radius, of, the, outer, core, is, about, half, of, the, radius, of, the, earth, if, the, field, at, the, core, mantle, boundary, is, fit, to, spherical, harmonics, the, dipole, part, is, smaller, by, a, factor, of, about, 8, at, the, surface, the, quadrupole, part, by, a, factor, of, 16, and, so, on, thus, only, the, components, with, large, wavelengths, can, be, noticeable, at, the, surface, from, a, variety, of, arguments, it, is, usually, assumed, that, only, terms, up, to, degree, 14, or, less, have, their, origin, in, the, core, these, have, wavelengths, of, about, 2, 000, km, 1, 200, mi, or, less, smaller, features, are, attributed, to, crustal, anomalies, the, international, association, of, geomagnetism, and, aeronomy, maintains, a, standard, global, field, model, called, the, international, geomagnetic, reference, field, igrf, it, is, updated, every, five, years, the, 11th, generation, model, igrf11, was, developed, using, data, from, satellites, rsted, champ, and, sac, c, and, a, world, network, of, geomagnetic, observatories, the, spherical, harmonic, expansion, was, truncated, at, degree, 10, with, 120, coefficients, until, 2000, subsequent, models, are, truncated, at, degree, 13, 195, coefficients, another, global, field, model, called, the, world, magnetic, model, is, produced, jointly, by, the, united, states, national, centers, for, environmental, information, formerly, the, national, geophysical, data, center, and, the, british, geological, survey, this, model, truncates, at, degree, 12, 168, coefficients, with, an, approximate, spatial, resolution, of, 3, 000, kilometers, it, is, the, model, used, by, the, united, states, department, of, defense, the, ministry, of, defence, united, kingdom, the, united, states, federal, aviation, administration, faa, the, north, atlantic, treaty, organization, nato, and, the, international, hydrographic, organization, as, well, as, in, many, civilian, navigation, systems, the, above, models, only, take, into, account, the, main, field, at, the, core, mantle, boundary, although, generally, good, enough, for, navigation, higher, accuracy, use, cases, require, smaller, scale, magnetic, anomalies, and, other, variations, to, be, considered, some, examples, are, see, geomag, us, ref, for, more, for, historical, data, about, the, main, field, the, igrf, may, be, used, back, to, year, 1900, a, specialized, gufm1, model, estimates, back, to, year, 1590, using, ship, s, logs, paleomagnetic, research, has, produced, models, dating, back, to, 10, 000, bce, animals, including, birds, and, turtles, can, detect, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, and, use, the, field, to, navigate, during, migration, some, researchers, have, found, that, cows, and, wild, deer, tend, to, align, their, bodies, north, south, while, relaxing, but, not, when, the, animals, are, under, high, voltage, power, lines, suggesting, that, magnetism, is, responsible, other, researchers, reported, in, 2011, that, they, could, not, replicate, those, findings, using, different, google, earth, images, very, weak, electromagnetic, fields, disrupt, the, magnetic, compass, used, by, european, robins, and, other, songbirds, which, use, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, to, navigate, neither, power, lines, nor, cellphone, signals, are, to, blame, for, the, electromagnetic, field, effect, on, the, birds, instead, the, culprits, have, frequencies, between, 2, khz, and, 5, mhz, these, include, am, radio, signals, and, ordinary, electronic, equipment, that, might, be, found, in, businesses, or, private, homes
