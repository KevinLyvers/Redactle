an, emulsion, is, a, mixture, of, two, or, more, liquids, that, are, normally, immiscible, unmixable, or, unblendable, owing, to, liquid, liquid, phase, separation, emulsions, are, part, of, a, more, general, class, of, two, phase, systems, of, matter, called, colloids, although, the, terms, colloid, and, emulsion, are, sometimes, used, interchangeably, emulsion, should, be, used, when, both, phases, dispersed, and, continuous, are, liquids, in, an, emulsion, one, liquid, the, dispersed, phase, is, dispersed, in, the, other, the, continuous, phase, examples, of, emulsions, include, vinaigrettes, homogenized, milk, liquid, biomolecular, condensates, and, some, cutting, fluids, for, metal, working, two, liquids, can, form, different, types, of, emulsions, as, an, example, oil, and, water, can, form, first, an, oil, in, water, emulsion, in, which, the, oil, is, the, dispersed, phase, and, water, is, the, continuous, phase, second, they, can, form, a, water, in, oil, emulsion, in, which, water, is, the, dispersed, phase, and, oil, is, the, continuous, phase, multiple, emulsions, are, also, possible, including, a, water, in, oil, in, water, emulsion, and, an, oil, in, water, in, oil, emulsion, emulsions, being, liquids, do, not, exhibit, a, static, internal, structure, the, droplets, dispersed, in, the, continuous, phase, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, dispersion, medium, are, usually, assumed, to, be, statistically, distributed, to, produce, roughly, spherical, droplets, the, term, emulsion, is, also, used, to, refer, to, the, photo, sensitive, side, of, photographic, film, such, a, photographic, emulsion, consists, of, silver, halide, colloidal, particles, dispersed, in, a, gelatin, matrix, nuclear, emulsions, are, similar, to, photographic, emulsions, except, that, they, are, used, in, particle, physics, to, detect, high, energy, elementary, particles, a, fluid, system, in, which, liquid, droplets, are, dispersed, in, a, liquid, note, 1, the, definition, is, based, on, the, definition, in, ref, note, 2, the, droplets, may, be, amorphous, liquid, crystalline, or, any, mixture, thereof, note, 3, the, diameters, of, the, droplets, constituting, the, dispersed, phase, usually, range, from, approximately, 10, nm, to, 100, m, i, e, the, droplets, may, exceed, the, usual, size, limits, for, colloidal, particles, note, 4, an, emulsion, is, termed, an, oil, water, o, w, emulsion, if, the, dispersed, phase, is, an, organic, material, and, the, continuous, phase, is, water, or, an, aqueous, solution, and, is, termed, water, oil, w, o, if, the, dispersed, phase, is, water, or, an, aqueous, solution, and, the, continuous, phase, is, an, organic, liquid, an, oil, note, 5, a, w, o, emulsion, is, sometimes, called, an, inverse, emulsion, the, term, inverse, emulsion, is, misleading, suggesting, incorrectly, that, the, emulsion, has, properties, that, are, the, opposite, of, those, of, an, emulsion, its, use, is, therefore, not, recommended, the, word, emulsion, comes, from, the, latin, emulgere, to, milk, out, from, ex, out, mulgere, to, milk, as, milk, is, an, emulsion, of, fat, and, water, along, with, other, components, including, colloidal, casein, micelles, a, type, of, secreted, biomolecular, condensate, emulsions, contain, both, a, dispersed, and, a, continuous, phase, with, the, boundary, between, the, phases, called, the, interface, emulsions, tend, to, have, a, cloudy, appearance, because, the, many, phase, interfaces, scatter, light, as, it, passes, through, the, emulsion, emulsions, appear, white, when, all, light, is, scattered, equally, if, the, emulsion, is, dilute, enough, higher, frequency, shorter, wavelength, light, will, be, scattered, more, and, the, emulsion, will, appear, bluer, this, is, called, the, tyndall, effect, if, the, emulsion, is, concentrated, enough, the, color, will, be, distorted, toward, comparatively, longer, wavelengths, and, will, appear, more, yellow, this, phenomenon, is, easily, observable, when, comparing, skimmed, milk, which, contains, little, fat, to, cream, which, contains, a, much, higher, concentration, of, milk, fat, one, example, would, be, a, mixture, of, water, and, oil, two, special, classes, of, emulsions, microemulsions, and, nanoemulsions, with, droplet, sizes, below, 100, nm, appear, translucent, this, property, is, due, to, the, fact, that, light, waves, are, scattered, by, the, droplets, only, if, their, sizes, exceed, about, one, quarter, of, the, wavelength, of, the, incident, light, since, the, visible, spectrum, of, light, is, composed, of, wavelengths, between, 390, and, 750, nanometers, nm, if, the, droplet, sizes, in, the, emulsion, are, below, about, 100, nm, the, light, can, penetrate, through, the, emulsion, without, being, scattered, due, to, their, similarity, in, appearance, translucent, nanoemulsions, and, microemulsions, are, frequently, confused, unlike, translucent, nanoemulsions, which, require, specialized, equipment, to, be, produced, microemulsions, are, spontaneously, formed, by, solubilizing, oil, molecules, with, a, mixture, of, surfactants, co, surfactants, and, co, solvents, the, required, surfactant, concentration, in, a, microemulsion, is, however, several, times, higher, than, that, in, a, translucent, nanoemulsion, and, significantly, exceeds, the, concentration, of, the, dispersed, phase, because, of, many, undesirable, side, effects, caused, by, surfactants, their, presence, is, disadvantageous, or, prohibitive, in, many, applications, in, addition, the, stability, of, a, microemulsion, is, often, easily, compromised, by, dilution, by, heating, or, by, changing, ph, levels, common, emulsions, are, inherently, unstable, and, thus, do, not, tend, to, form, spontaneously, energy, input, through, shaking, stirring, homogenizing, or, exposure, to, power, ultrasound, is, needed, to, form, an, emulsion, over, time, emulsions, tend, to, revert, to, the, stable, state, of, the, phases, comprising, the, emulsion, an, example, of, this, is, seen, in, the, separation, of, the, oil, and, vinegar, components, of, vinaigrette, an, unstable, emulsion, that, will, quickly, separate, unless, shaken, almost, continuously, there, are, important, exceptions, to, this, rule, microemulsions, are, thermodynamically, stable, while, translucent, nanoemulsions, are, kinetically, stable, whether, an, emulsion, of, oil, and, water, turns, into, a, water, in, oil, emulsion, or, an, oil, in, water, emulsion, depends, on, the, volume, fraction, of, both, phases, and, the, type, of, emulsifier, surfactant, see, emulsifier, below, present, emulsion, stability, refers, to, the, ability, of, an, emulsion, to, resist, change, in, its, properties, over, time, there, are, four, types, of, instability, in, emulsions, flocculation, coalescence, creaming, sedimentation, and, ostwald, ripening, flocculation, occurs, when, there, is, an, attractive, force, between, the, droplets, so, they, form, flocs, like, bunches, of, grapes, this, process, can, be, desired, if, controlled, in, its, extent, to, tune, physical, properties, of, emulsions, such, as, their, flow, behaviour, coalescence, occurs, when, droplets, bump, into, each, other, and, combine, to, form, a, larger, droplet, so, the, average, droplet, size, increases, over, time, emulsions, can, also, undergo, creaming, where, the, droplets, rise, to, the, top, of, the, emulsion, under, the, influence, of, buoyancy, or, under, the, influence, of, the, centripetal, force, induced, when, a, centrifuge, is, used, creaming, is, a, common, phenomenon, in, dairy, and, non, dairy, beverages, i, e, milk, coffee, milk, almond, milk, soy, milk, and, usually, does, not, change, the, droplet, size, sedimentation, is, the, opposite, phenomenon, of, creaming, and, normally, observed, in, water, in, oil, emulsions, sedimentation, happens, when, the, dispersed, phase, is, denser, than, the, continuous, phase, and, the, gravitational, forces, pull, the, denser, globules, towards, the, bottom, of, the, emulsion, similar, to, creaming, sedimentation, follows, stokes, law, an, appropriate, surface, active, agent, or, surfactant, can, increase, the, kinetic, stability, of, an, emulsion, so, that, the, size, of, the, droplets, does, not, change, significantly, with, time, the, stability, of, an, emulsion, like, a, suspension, can, be, studied, in, terms, of, zeta, potential, which, indicates, the, repulsion, between, droplets, or, particles, if, the, size, and, dispersion, of, droplets, does, not, change, over, time, it, is, said, to, be, stable, for, example, oil, in, water, emulsions, containing, mono, and, diglycerides, and, milk, protein, as, surfactant, showed, that, stable, oil, droplet, size, over, 28, days, storage, at, 25, c, the, stability, of, emulsions, can, be, characterized, using, techniques, such, as, light, scattering, focused, beam, reflectance, measurement, centrifugation, and, rheology, each, method, has, advantages, and, disadvantages, the, kinetic, process, of, destabilization, can, be, rather, long, up, to, several, months, or, even, years, for, some, products, often, the, formulator, must, accelerate, this, process, in, order, to, test, products, in, a, reasonable, time, during, product, design, thermal, methods, are, the, most, commonly, used, these, consist, of, increasing, the, emulsion, temperature, to, accelerate, destabilization, if, below, critical, temperatures, for, phase, inversion, or, chemical, degradation, temperature, affects, not, only, the, viscosity, but, also, the, interfacial, tension, in, the, case, of, non, ionic, surfactants, or, on, a, broader, scope, interactions, between, droplets, within, the, system, storing, an, emulsion, at, high, temperatures, enables, the, simulation, of, realistic, conditions, for, a, product, e, g, a, tube, of, sunscreen, emulsion, in, a, car, in, the, summer, heat, but, also, accelerates, destabilization, processes, up, to, 200, times, mechanical, methods, of, acceleration, including, vibration, centrifugation, and, agitation, can, also, be, used, these, methods, are, almost, always, empirical, without, a, sound, scientific, basis, an, emulsifier, is, a, substance, that, stabilizes, an, emulsion, by, reducing, the, oil, water, interface, tension, emulsifiers, are, a, part, of, a, broader, group, of, compounds, known, as, surfactants, or, surface, active, agents, surfactants, are, compounds, that, are, typically, amphiphilic, meaning, they, have, a, polar, or, hydrophilic, i, e, water, soluble, part, and, a, non, polar, i, e, hydrophobic, or, lipophilic, part, emulsifiers, that, are, more, soluble, in, water, and, conversely, less, soluble, in, oil, will, generally, form, oil, in, water, emulsions, while, emulsifiers, that, are, more, soluble, in, oil, will, form, water, in, oil, emulsions, examples, of, food, emulsifiers, are, in, food, emulsions, the, type, of, emulsifier, greatly, affects, how, emulsions, are, structured, in, the, stomach, and, how, accessible, the, oil, is, for, gastric, lipases, thereby, influencing, how, fast, emulsions, are, digested, and, trigger, a, satiety, inducing, hormone, response, detergents, are, another, class, of, surfactant, and, will, interact, physically, with, both, oil, and, water, thus, stabilizing, the, interface, between, the, oil, and, water, droplets, in, suspension, this, principle, is, exploited, in, soap, to, remove, grease, for, the, purpose, of, cleaning, many, different, emulsifiers, are, used, in, pharmacy, to, prepare, emulsions, such, as, creams, and, lotions, common, examples, include, emulsifying, wax, polysorbate, 20, and, ceteareth, 20, sometimes, the, inner, phase, itself, can, act, as, an, emulsifier, and, the, result, is, a, nanoemulsion, where, the, inner, state, disperses, into, nano, size, droplets, within, the, outer, phase, a, well, known, example, of, this, phenomenon, the, ouzo, effect, happens, when, water, is, poured, into, a, strong, alcoholic, anise, based, beverage, such, as, ouzo, pastis, absinthe, arak, or, raki, the, anisolic, compounds, which, are, soluble, in, ethanol, then, form, nano, size, droplets, and, emulsify, within, the, water, the, resulting, color, of, the, drink, is, opaque, and, milky, white, a, number, of, different, chemical, and, physical, processes, and, mechanisms, can, be, involved, in, the, process, of, emulsification, oil, in, water, emulsions, are, common, in, food, products, water, in, oil, emulsions, are, less, common, in, food, but, still, exist, other, foods, can, be, turned, into, products, similar, to, emulsions, for, example, meat, emulsion, is, a, suspension, of, meat, in, liquid, that, is, similar, to, true, emulsions, in, pharmaceutics, hairstyling, personal, hygiene, and, cosmetics, emulsions, are, frequently, used, these, are, usually, oil, and, water, emulsions, but, dispersed, and, which, is, continuous, depends, in, many, cases, on, the, pharmaceutical, formulation, these, emulsions, may, be, called, creams, ointments, liniments, balms, pastes, films, or, liquids, depending, mostly, on, their, oil, to, water, ratios, other, additives, and, their, intended, route, of, administration, the, first, 5, are, topical, dosage, forms, and, may, be, used, on, the, surface, of, the, skin, transdermally, ophthalmically, rectally, or, vaginally, a, highly, liquid, emulsion, may, also, be, used, orally, or, may, be, injected, in, some, cases, microemulsions, are, used, to, deliver, vaccines, and, kill, microbes, typical, emulsions, used, in, these, techniques, are, nanoemulsions, of, soybean, oil, with, particles, that, are, 400, 600, nm, in, diameter, the, process, is, not, chemical, as, with, other, types, of, antimicrobial, treatments, but, mechanical, the, smaller, the, droplet, the, greater, the, surface, tension, and, thus, the, greater, the, force, required, to, merge, with, other, lipids, the, oil, is, emulsified, with, detergents, using, a, high, shear, mixer, to, stabilize, the, emulsion, so, when, they, encounter, the, lipids, in, the, cell, membrane, or, envelope, of, bacteria, or, viruses, they, force, the, lipids, to, merge, with, themselves, on, a, mass, scale, in, effect, this, disintegrates, the, membrane, and, kills, the, pathogen, the, soybean, oil, emulsion, does, not, harm, normal, human, cells, or, the, cells, of, most, other, higher, organisms, with, the, exceptions, of, sperm, cells, and, blood, cells, which, are, vulnerable, to, nanoemulsions, due, to, the, peculiarities, of, their, membrane, structures, for, this, reason, these, nanoemulsions, are, not, currently, used, intravenously, iv, the, most, effective, application, of, this, type, of, nanoemulsion, is, for, the, disinfection, of, surfaces, some, types, of, nanoemulsions, have, been, shown, to, effectively, destroy, hiv, 1, and, tuberculosis, pathogens, on, non, porous, surfaces, emulsifying, agents, are, effective, at, extinguishing, fires, on, small, thin, layer, spills, of, flammable, liquids, class, b, fires, such, agents, encapsulate, the, fuel, in, a, fuel, water, emulsion, thereby, trapping, the, flammable, vapors, in, the, water, phase, this, emulsion, is, achieved, by, applying, an, aqueous, surfactant, solution, to, the, fuel, through, a, high, pressure, nozzle, emulsifiers, are, not, effective, at, extinguishing, large, fires, involving, bulk, deep, liquid, fuels, because, the, amount, of, emulsifier, agent, needed, for, extinguishment, is, a, function, of, the, volume, of, the, fuel, whereas, other, agents, such, as, aqueous, film, forming, foam, need, cover, only, the, surface, of, the, fuel, to, achieve, vapor, mitigation, emulsions, are, used, to, manufacture, polymer, dispersions, polymer, production, in, an, emulsion, phase, has, a, number, of, process, advantages, including, prevention, of, coagulation, of, product, products, produced, by, such, polymerisations, may, be, used, as, the, emulsions, products, including, primary, components, for, glues, and, paints, synthetic, latexes, rubbers, are, also, produced, by, this, process
