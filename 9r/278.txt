physical, chemistry, is, the, study, of, macroscopic, and, microscopic, phenomena, in, chemical, systems, in, terms, of, the, principles, practices, and, concepts, of, physics, such, as, motion, energy, force, time, thermodynamics, quantum, chemistry, statistical, mechanics, analytical, dynamics, and, chemical, equilibria, physical, chemistry, in, contrast, to, chemical, physics, is, predominantly, but, not, always, a, supra, molecular, science, as, the, majority, of, the, principles, on, which, it, was, founded, relate, to, the, bulk, rather, than, the, molecular, or, atomic, structure, alone, for, example, chemical, equilibrium, and, colloids, some, of, the, relationships, that, physical, chemistry, strives, to, understand, include, the, effects, of, the, key, concepts, of, physical, chemistry, are, the, ways, in, which, pure, physics, is, applied, to, chemical, problems, one, of, the, key, concepts, in, classical, chemistry, is, that, all, chemical, compounds, can, be, described, as, groups, of, atoms, bonded, together, and, chemical, reactions, can, be, described, as, the, making, and, breaking, of, those, bonds, predicting, the, properties, of, chemical, compounds, from, a, description, of, atoms, and, how, they, bond, is, one, of, the, major, goals, of, physical, chemistry, to, describe, the, atoms, and, bonds, precisely, it, is, necessary, to, know, both, where, the, nuclei, of, the, atoms, are, and, how, electrons, are, distributed, around, them, quantum, chemistry, a, subfield, of, physical, chemistry, especially, concerned, with, the, application, of, quantum, mechanics, to, chemical, problems, provides, tools, to, determine, how, strong, and, what, shape, bonds, are, how, nuclei, move, and, how, light, can, be, absorbed, or, emitted, by, a, chemical, compound, spectroscopy, is, the, related, sub, discipline, of, physical, chemistry, which, is, specifically, concerned, with, the, interaction, of, electromagnetic, radiation, with, matter, another, set, of, important, questions, in, chemistry, concerns, what, kind, of, reactions, can, happen, spontaneously, and, which, properties, are, possible, for, a, given, chemical, mixture, this, is, studied, in, chemical, thermodynamics, which, sets, limits, on, quantities, like, how, far, a, reaction, can, proceed, or, how, much, energy, can, be, converted, into, work, in, an, internal, combustion, engine, and, which, provides, links, between, properties, like, the, thermal, expansion, coefficient, and, rate, of, change, of, entropy, with, pressure, for, a, gas, or, a, liquid, it, can, frequently, be, used, to, assess, whether, a, reactor, or, engine, design, is, feasible, or, to, check, the, validity, of, experimental, data, to, a, limited, extent, quasi, equilibrium, and, non, equilibrium, thermodynamics, can, describe, irreversible, changes, however, classical, thermodynamics, is, mostly, concerned, with, systems, in, equilibrium, and, reversible, changes, and, not, what, actually, does, happen, or, how, fast, away, from, equilibrium, which, reactions, do, occur, and, how, fast, is, the, subject, of, chemical, kinetics, another, branch, of, physical, chemistry, a, key, idea, in, chemical, kinetics, is, that, for, reactants, to, react, and, form, products, most, chemical, species, must, go, through, transition, states, which, are, higher, in, energy, than, either, the, reactants, or, the, products, and, serve, as, a, barrier, to, reaction, in, general, the, higher, the, barrier, the, slower, the, reaction, a, second, is, that, most, chemical, reactions, occur, as, a, sequence, of, elementary, reactions, each, with, its, own, transition, state, key, questions, in, kinetics, include, how, the, rate, of, reaction, depends, on, temperature, and, on, the, concentrations, of, reactants, and, catalysts, in, the, reaction, mixture, as, well, as, how, catalysts, and, reaction, conditions, can, be, engineered, to, optimize, the, reaction, rate, the, fact, that, how, fast, reactions, occur, can, often, be, specified, with, just, a, few, concentrations, and, a, temperature, instead, of, needing, to, know, all, the, positions, and, speeds, of, every, molecule, in, a, mixture, is, a, special, case, of, another, key, concept, in, physical, chemistry, which, is, that, to, the, extent, an, engineer, needs, to, know, everything, going, on, in, a, mixture, of, very, large, numbers, perhaps, of, the, order, of, the, avogadro, constant, 6, x, 10, 23, of, particles, can, often, be, described, by, just, a, few, variables, like, pressure, temperature, and, concentration, the, precise, reasons, for, this, are, described, in, statistical, mechanics, a, specialty, within, physical, chemistry, which, is, also, shared, with, physics, statistical, mechanics, also, provides, ways, to, predict, the, properties, we, see, in, everyday, life, from, molecular, properties, without, relying, on, empirical, correlations, based, on, chemical, similarities, the, term, physical, chemistry, was, coined, by, mikhail, lomonosov, in, 1752, when, he, presented, a, lecture, course, entitled, a, course, in, true, physical, chemistry, russian, before, the, students, of, petersburg, university, in, the, preamble, to, these, lectures, he, gives, the, definition, physical, chemistry, is, the, science, that, must, explain, under, provisions, of, physical, experiments, the, reason, for, what, is, happening, in, complex, bodies, through, chemical, operations, modern, physical, chemistry, originated, in, the, 1860s, to, 1880s, with, work, on, chemical, thermodynamics, electrolytes, in, solutions, chemical, kinetics, and, other, subjects, one, milestone, was, the, publication, in, 1876, by, josiah, willard, gibbs, of, his, paper, on, the, equilibrium, of, heterogeneous, substances, this, paper, introduced, several, of, the, cornerstones, of, physical, chemistry, such, as, gibbs, energy, chemical, potentials, and, gibbs, phase, rule, the, first, scientific, journal, specifically, in, the, field, of, physical, chemistry, was, the, german, journal, zeitschrift, f, r, physikalische, chemie, founded, in, 1887, by, wilhelm, ostwald, and, jacobus, henricus, van, t, hoff, together, with, svante, august, arrhenius, these, were, the, leading, figures, in, physical, chemistry, in, the, late, 19th, century, and, early, 20th, century, all, three, were, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, between, 1901, and, 1909, developments, in, the, following, decades, include, the, application, of, statistical, mechanics, to, chemical, systems, and, work, on, colloids, and, surface, chemistry, where, irving, langmuir, made, many, contributions, another, important, step, was, the, development, of, quantum, mechanics, into, quantum, chemistry, from, the, 1930s, where, linus, pauling, was, one, of, the, leading, names, theoretical, developments, have, gone, hand, in, hand, with, developments, in, experimental, methods, where, the, use, of, different, forms, of, spectroscopy, such, as, infrared, spectroscopy, microwave, spectroscopy, electron, paramagnetic, resonance, and, nuclear, magnetic, resonance, spectroscopy, is, probably, the, most, important, 20th, century, development, further, development, in, physical, chemistry, may, be, attributed, to, discoveries, in, nuclear, chemistry, especially, in, isotope, separation, before, and, during, world, war, ii, more, recent, discoveries, in, astrochemistry, as, well, as, the, development, of, calculation, algorithms, in, the, field, of, additive, physicochemical, properties, practically, all, physicochemical, properties, such, as, boiling, point, critical, point, surface, tension, vapor, pressure, etc, more, than, 20, in, all, can, be, precisely, calculated, from, chemical, structure, alone, even, if, the, chemical, molecule, remains, unsynthesized, and, herein, lies, the, practical, importance, of, contemporary, physical, chemistry, see, group, contribution, method, lydersen, method, joback, method, benson, group, increment, theory, quantitative, structure, activity, relationship, some, journals, that, deal, with, physical, chemistry, include, historical, journals, that, covered, both, chemistry, and, physics, include, annales, de, chimie, et, de, physique, started, in, 1789, published, under, the, name, given, here, from, 1815, to, 1914
