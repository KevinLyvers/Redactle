the, higgs, boson, sometimes, called, the, higgs, particle, is, an, elementary, particle, in, the, standard, model, of, particle, physics, produced, by, the, quantum, excitation, of, the, higgs, field, one, of, the, fields, in, particle, physics, theory, in, the, standard, model, the, higgs, particle, is, a, massive, scalar, boson, with, zero, spin, even, positive, parity, no, electric, charge, and, no, colour, charge, that, couples, to, interacts, with, mass, it, is, also, very, unstable, decaying, into, other, particles, almost, immediately, upon, generation, the, higgs, field, is, a, scalar, field, with, two, neutral, and, two, electrically, charged, components, that, form, a, complex, doublet, of, the, weak, isospin, su, 2, symmetry, its, sombrero, potential, leads, it, to, take, a, nonzero, value, everywhere, including, otherwise, empty, space, which, breaks, the, weak, isospin, symmetry, of, the, electroweak, interaction, and, via, the, higgs, mechanism, gives, a, rest, mass, to, all, massive, elementary, particles, of, the, standard, model, including, the, higgs, boson, itself, the, existence, of, the, higgs, field, became, the, last, unverified, part, of, the, standard, model, of, particle, physics, and, for, several, decades, was, considered, the, central, problem, in, particle, physics, both, the, field, and, the, boson, are, named, after, physicist, peter, higgs, who, in, 1964, along, with, five, other, scientists, in, three, teams, proposed, the, higgs, mechanism, a, way, for, some, particles, to, acquire, mass, all, fundamental, particles, known, at, the, time, should, be, massless, at, very, high, energies, but, fully, explaining, how, some, particles, gain, mass, at, lower, energies, had, been, extremely, difficult, if, these, ideas, were, correct, a, particle, known, as, a, scalar, boson, should, also, exist, with, certain, properties, this, particle, was, called, the, higgs, boson, and, could, be, used, to, test, whether, the, higgs, field, was, the, correct, explanation, after, a, 40, year, search, a, subatomic, particle, with, the, expected, properties, was, discovered, in, 2012, by, the, atlas, and, cms, experiments, at, the, large, hadron, collider, lhc, at, cern, near, geneva, switzerland, the, new, particle, was, subsequently, confirmed, to, match, the, expected, properties, of, a, higgs, boson, physicists, from, two, of, the, three, teams, peter, higgs, and, fran, ois, englert, were, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, in, 2013, for, their, theoretical, predictions, although, higgs, s, name, has, come, to, be, associated, with, this, theory, several, researchers, between, about, 1960, and, 1972, independently, developed, different, parts, of, it, in, the, media, the, higgs, boson, has, often, been, called, the, god, particle, after, the, 1993, book, the, god, particle, by, nobel, laureate, leon, lederman, the, name, has, been, criticised, by, physicists, including, higgs, physicists, explain, the, fundamental, particles, and, forces, of, our, universe, in, terms, of, the, standard, model, a, widely, accepted, framework, based, on, quantum, field, theory, that, predicts, almost, all, known, particles, and, forces, aside, from, gravity, with, great, accuracy, a, separate, theory, general, relativity, is, used, for, gravity, in, the, standard, model, the, particles, and, forces, in, nature, aside, from, gravity, arise, from, properties, of, quantum, fields, known, as, gauge, invariance, and, symmetries, forces, in, the, standard, model, are, transmitted, by, particles, known, as, gauge, bosons, gauge, invariant, theories, are, theories, which, have, a, useful, feature, some, kinds, of, changes, to, the, value, of, certain, items, do, not, make, any, difference, to, the, outcomes, or, the, measurements, we, make, an, example, changing, voltages, in, an, electromagnet, by, 100, volts, does, not, cause, any, change, to, the, magnetic, field, it, produces, similarly, measuring, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, seems, to, give, the, identical, result, whatever, the, location, in, time, and, space, and, whatever, the, local, gravitational, field, in, these, kinds, of, theories, the, gauge, is, an, item, whose, value, we, can, change, the, fact, that, some, changes, leave, the, results, we, measure, unchanged, means, it, is, a, gauge, invariant, theory, and, symmetries, are, the, specific, kinds, of, changes, to, the, gauge, which, have, the, effect, of, leaving, measurements, unchanged, symmetries, of, this, kind, are, powerful, tools, for, a, deep, understanding, of, the, fundamental, forces, and, particles, of, our, physical, world, gauge, invariance, is, therefore, an, important, property, within, particle, physics, theory, they, are, closely, connected, to, conservation, laws, and, are, described, mathematically, using, group, theory, quantum, field, theory, and, the, standard, model, are, both, gauge, invariant, theories, meaning, they, focus, on, properties, of, our, universe, demonstrating, this, property, of, gauge, invariance, and, the, symmetries, which, are, involved, quantum, field, theories, based, on, gauge, invariance, had, been, used, with, great, success, in, understanding, the, electromagnetic, and, strong, forces, but, by, around, 1960, all, attempts, to, create, a, gauge, invariant, theory, for, the, weak, force, and, its, combination, with, the, electromagnetic, force, known, together, as, the, electroweak, interaction, had, consistently, failed, as, a, result, of, these, failures, gauge, theories, began, to, fall, into, disrepute, the, problem, was, symmetry, requirements, for, these, two, forces, incorrectly, predicted, the, weak, force, s, gauge, bosons, w, and, z, would, have, zero, mass, in, the, specialized, terminology, of, particle, physics, mass, refers, specifically, to, a, particle, s, rest, mass, but, experiments, showed, the, w, and, z, gauge, bosons, had, non, zero, rest, mass, further, many, promising, solutions, seemed, to, require, the, existence, of, extra, particles, known, as, goldstone, bosons, but, evidence, suggested, these, did, not, exist, either, this, meant, either, gauge, invariance, was, an, incorrect, approach, or, something, unknown, was, giving, the, weak, force, s, w, and, z, bosons, their, mass, and, doing, it, in, a, way, that, did, not, create, goldstone, bosons, by, the, late, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, physicists, were, at, a, loss, as, to, how, to, resolve, these, issues, or, how, to, create, a, comprehensive, theory, for, particle, physics, in, the, late, 1950s, yoichiro, nambu, recognised, that, spontaneous, symmetry, breaking, a, process, where, a, symmetric, system, becomes, asymmetric, could, occur, under, certain, conditions, symmetry, breaking, is, when, some, variable, that, previously, didn, t, affect, the, measured, results, it, was, originally, a, symmetry, now, does, affect, the, measured, results, it, s, now, broken, and, no, longer, a, symmetry, in, 1962, physicist, philip, anderson, an, expert, in, condensed, matter, physics, observed, that, symmetry, breaking, played, a, role, in, superconductivity, and, suggested, it, could, also, be, part, of, the, answer, to, the, problem, of, gauge, invariance, in, particle, physics, specifically, anderson, suggested, that, the, goldstone, bosons, that, would, result, from, symmetry, breaking, might, instead, in, some, circumstances, be, absorbed, by, the, massless, w, and, z, bosons, if, so, perhaps, the, goldstone, bosons, would, not, exist, and, the, w, and, z, bosons, could, gain, mass, solving, both, problems, at, once, similar, behaviour, was, already, theorised, in, superconductivity, in, 1964, this, was, shown, to, be, theoretically, possible, by, physicists, abraham, klein, and, benjamin, lee, at, least, for, some, limited, non, relativistic, cases, following, the, 1963, and, early, 1964, papers, three, groups, of, researchers, independently, developed, these, theories, more, completely, in, what, became, known, as, the, 1964, prl, symmetry, breaking, papers, all, three, groups, reached, similar, conclusions, and, for, all, cases, not, just, some, limited, cases, they, showed, that, the, conditions, for, electroweak, symmetry, would, be, broken, if, an, unusual, type, of, field, existed, throughout, the, universe, and, indeed, there, would, be, no, goldstone, bosons, and, some, existing, bosons, would, acquire, mass, the, field, required, for, this, to, happen, which, was, purely, hypothetical, at, the, time, became, known, as, the, higgs, field, after, peter, higgs, one, of, the, researchers, and, the, mechanism, by, which, it, led, to, symmetry, breaking, became, known, as, the, higgs, mechanism, a, key, feature, of, the, necessary, field, is, that, it, would, take, less, energy, for, the, field, to, have, a, non, zero, value, than, a, zero, value, unlike, all, other, known, fields, therefore, the, higgs, field, has, a, non, zero, value, or, vacuum, expectation, everywhere, this, non, zero, value, could, in, theory, break, electroweak, symmetry, it, was, the, first, proposal, capable, of, showing, how, the, weak, force, gauge, bosons, could, have, mass, despite, their, governing, symmetry, within, a, gauge, invariant, theory, although, these, ideas, did, not, gain, much, initial, support, or, attention, by, 1972, they, had, been, developed, into, a, comprehensive, theory, and, proved, capable, of, giving, sensible, results, that, accurately, described, particles, known, at, the, time, and, which, with, exceptional, accuracy, predicted, several, other, particles, discovered, during, the, following, years, during, the, 1970s, these, theories, rapidly, became, the, standard, model, of, particle, physics, to, allow, symmetry, breaking, the, standard, model, includes, a, field, of, the, kind, needed, to, break, electroweak, symmetry, and, give, particles, their, correct, mass, this, field, which, became, known, as, the, higgs, field, was, hypothesized, to, exist, throughout, space, and, to, break, some, symmetry, laws, of, the, electroweak, interaction, triggering, the, higgs, mechanism, it, therefore, would, cause, the, w, and, z, gauge, bosons, of, the, weak, force, to, be, massive, at, all, temperatures, below, an, extremely, high, value, when, the, weak, force, bosons, acquire, mass, this, affects, the, distance, they, can, freely, travel, which, becomes, very, small, also, matching, experimental, findings, furthermore, it, was, later, realised, that, the, same, field, would, also, explain, in, a, different, way, why, other, fundamental, constituents, of, matter, including, electrons, and, quarks, have, mass, unlike, all, other, known, fields, such, as, the, electromagnetic, field, the, higgs, field, is, a, scalar, field, and, has, a, non, zero, average, value, in, vacuum, there, was, not, yet, any, direct, evidence, that, the, higgs, field, existed, but, even, without, direct, proof, the, accuracy, of, its, predictions, led, scientists, to, believe, the, theory, might, be, true, by, the, 1980s, the, question, of, whether, the, higgs, field, existed, and, therefore, whether, the, entire, standard, model, was, correct, had, come, to, be, regarded, as, one, of, the, most, important, unanswered, questions, in, particle, physics, the, existence, of, the, higgs, field, became, the, last, unverified, part, of, the, standard, model, of, particle, physics, and, for, several, decades, was, considered, the, central, problem, in, particle, physics, for, many, decades, scientists, had, no, way, to, determine, whether, the, higgs, field, existed, because, the, technology, needed, for, its, detection, did, not, exist, at, that, time, if, the, higgs, field, did, exist, then, it, would, be, unlike, any, other, known, fundamental, field, but, it, also, was, possible, that, these, key, ideas, or, even, the, entire, standard, model, were, somehow, incorrect, the, hypothesised, higgs, theory, made, several, key, predictions, 22, one, crucial, prediction, was, that, a, matching, particle, called, the, higgs, boson, should, also, exist, proving, the, existence, of, the, higgs, boson, would, prove, whether, the, higgs, field, existed, and, therefore, finally, prove, whether, the, standard, model, s, explanation, was, correct, therefore, there, was, an, extensive, search, for, the, higgs, boson, as, a, way, to, prove, the, higgs, field, itself, existed, although, the, higgs, field, would, exist, everywhere, proving, its, existence, was, far, from, easy, in, principle, it, can, be, proved, to, exist, by, detecting, its, excitations, which, manifest, as, higgs, particles, the, higgs, boson, but, these, are, extremely, difficult, to, produce, and, detect, due, to, the, energy, required, to, produce, them, and, their, very, rare, production, even, if, the, energy, is, sufficient, it, was, therefore, several, decades, before, the, first, evidence, of, the, higgs, boson, could, be, found, particle, colliders, detectors, and, computers, capable, of, looking, for, higgs, bosons, took, more, than, 30, years, c, 1980, 2010, to, develop, the, importance, of, this, fundamental, question, led, to, a, 40, year, search, and, the, construction, of, one, of, the, world, s, most, expensive, and, complex, experimental, facilities, to, date, cern, s, large, hadron, collider, in, an, attempt, to, create, higgs, bosons, and, other, particles, for, observation, and, study, on, 4, july, 2012, the, discovery, of, a, new, particle, with, a, mass, between, 125, and, 127, gev, c, 2, was, announced, physicists, suspected, that, it, was, the, higgs, boson, since, then, the, particle, has, been, shown, to, behave, interact, and, decay, in, many, of, the, ways, predicted, for, higgs, particles, by, the, standard, model, as, well, as, having, even, parity, and, zero, spin, two, fundamental, attributes, of, a, higgs, boson, this, also, means, it, is, the, first, elementary, scalar, particle, discovered, in, nature, by, march, 2013, the, existence, of, the, higgs, boson, was, confirmed, and, therefore, the, concept, of, some, type, of, higgs, field, throughout, space, is, strongly, supported, the, presence, of, the, field, now, confirmed, by, experimental, investigation, explains, why, some, fundamental, particles, have, a, rest, mass, despite, the, symmetries, controlling, their, interactions, implying, that, they, should, be, massless, it, also, resolves, several, other, long, standing, puzzles, such, as, the, reason, for, the, extremely, short, distance, travelled, by, the, weak, force, bosons, and, therefore, the, weak, force, s, extremely, short, range, as, of, 2018, in, depth, research, shows, the, particle, continuing, to, behave, in, line, with, predictions, for, the, standard, model, higgs, boson, more, studies, are, needed, to, verify, with, higher, precision, that, the, discovered, particle, has, all, of, the, properties, predicted, or, whether, as, described, by, some, theories, multiple, higgs, bosons, exist, the, nature, and, properties, of, this, field, are, now, being, investigated, further, using, more, data, collected, at, the, lhc, various, analogies, have, been, used, to, describe, the, higgs, field, and, boson, including, analogies, with, well, known, symmetry, breaking, effects, such, as, the, rainbow, and, prism, electric, fields, and, ripples, on, the, surface, of, water, other, analogies, based, on, the, resistance, of, macro, objects, moving, through, media, such, as, people, moving, through, crowds, or, some, objects, moving, through, syrup, or, molasses, are, commonly, used, but, misleading, since, the, higgs, field, does, not, actually, resist, particles, and, the, effect, of, mass, is, not, caused, by, resistance, in, the, standard, model, the, higgs, boson, is, a, massive, scalar, boson, whose, mass, must, be, found, experimentally, its, mass, has, been, determined, to, be, 125, 35, 0, 15, gev, c, 2, by, cms, 2022, and, 125, 11, 0, 11, gev, c, 2, by, atlas, 2023, it, is, the, only, particle, that, remains, massive, even, at, very, high, energies, it, has, zero, spin, even, positive, parity, no, electric, charge, and, no, colour, charge, and, it, couples, to, interacts, with, mass, it, is, also, very, unstable, decaying, into, other, particles, almost, immediately, via, several, possible, pathways, the, higgs, field, is, a, scalar, field, with, two, neutral, and, two, electrically, charged, components, that, form, a, complex, doublet, of, the, weak, isospin, su, 2, symmetry, unlike, any, other, known, quantum, field, it, has, a, sombrero, potential, this, shape, means, that, below, extremely, high, energies, of, about, 159, 5, 1, 5, gev, such, as, those, seen, during, the, first, picosecond, 10, 12, s, of, the, big, bang, the, higgs, field, in, its, ground, state, takes, less, energy, to, have, a, nonzero, vacuum, expectation, value, than, a, zero, value, therefore, in, today, s, universe, the, higgs, field, has, a, nonzero, value, everywhere, including, otherwise, empty, space, this, nonzero, value, in, turn, breaks, the, weak, isospin, su, 2, symmetry, of, the, electroweak, interaction, everywhere, technically, the, non, zero, expectation, value, converts, the, lagrangian, s, yukawa, coupling, terms, into, mass, terms, when, this, happens, three, components, of, the, higgs, field, are, absorbed, by, the, su, 2, and, u, 1, gauge, bosons, the, higgs, mechanism, to, become, the, longitudinal, components, of, the, now, massive, w, and, z, bosons, of, the, weak, force, the, remaining, electrically, neutral, component, either, manifests, as, a, higgs, boson, or, may, couple, separately, to, other, particles, known, as, fermions, via, yukawa, couplings, causing, these, to, acquire, mass, as, well, evidence, of, the, higgs, field, and, its, properties, has, been, extremely, significant, for, many, reasons, the, importance, of, the, higgs, boson, largely, is, that, it, is, able, to, be, examined, using, existing, knowledge, and, experimental, technology, as, a, way, to, confirm, and, study, the, entire, higgs, field, theory, conversely, proof, that, the, higgs, field, and, boson, did, not, exist, would, have, also, been, significant, the, higgs, boson, validates, the, standard, model, through, the, mechanism, of, mass, generation, as, more, precise, measurements, of, its, properties, are, made, more, advanced, extensions, may, be, suggested, or, excluded, as, experimental, means, to, measure, the, field, s, behaviours, and, interactions, are, developed, this, fundamental, field, may, be, better, understood, if, the, higgs, field, had, not, been, discovered, the, standard, model, would, have, needed, to, be, modified, or, superseded, related, to, this, a, belief, generally, exists, among, physicists, that, there, is, likely, to, be, new, physics, beyond, the, standard, model, and, the, standard, model, will, at, some, point, be, extended, or, superseded, the, higgs, discovery, as, well, as, the, many, measured, collisions, occurring, at, the, lhc, provide, physicists, a, sensitive, tool, to, search, their, data, for, any, evidence, that, the, standard, model, seems, to, fail, and, could, provide, considerable, evidence, guiding, researchers, into, future, theoretical, developments, below, an, extremely, high, temperature, electroweak, symmetry, breaking, causes, the, electroweak, interaction, to, manifest, in, part, as, the, short, ranged, weak, force, which, is, carried, by, massive, gauge, bosons, in, the, history, of, the, universe, electroweak, symmetry, breaking, is, believed, to, have, happened, at, about, 1, picosecond, 10, 12, s, after, the, big, bang, when, the, universe, was, at, a, temperature, 159, 5, 1, 5, gev, k, b, this, symmetry, breaking, is, required, for, atoms, and, other, structures, to, form, as, well, as, for, nuclear, reactions, in, stars, such, as, the, sun, the, higgs, field, is, responsible, for, this, symmetry, breaking, the, higgs, field, is, pivotal, in, generating, the, masses, of, quarks, and, charged, leptons, through, yukawa, coupling, and, the, w, and, z, gauge, bosons, through, the, higgs, mechanism, it, is, worth, noting, that, the, higgs, field, does, not, create, mass, out, of, nothing, which, would, violate, the, law, of, conservation, of, energy, nor, is, the, higgs, field, responsible, for, the, mass, of, all, particles, for, example, approximately, 99, of, the, mass, of, baryons, composite, particles, such, as, the, proton, and, neutron, is, due, instead, to, quantum, chromodynamic, binding, energy, which, is, the, sum, of, the, kinetic, energies, of, quarks, and, the, energies, of, the, massless, gluons, mediating, the, strong, interaction, inside, the, baryons, in, higgs, based, theories, the, property, of, mass, is, a, manifestation, of, potential, energy, transferred, to, fundamental, particles, when, they, interact, couple, with, the, higgs, field, which, had, contained, that, mass, in, the, form, of, energy, the, higgs, field, is, the, only, scalar, spin, 0, field, to, be, detected, all, the, other, fundamental, fields, in, the, standard, model, are, spin, 1, 2, fermions, or, spin, 1, bosons, according, to, rolf, dieter, heuer, director, general, of, cern, when, the, higgs, boson, was, discovered, this, existence, proof, of, a, scalar, field, is, almost, as, important, as, the, higgs, s, role, in, determining, the, mass, of, other, particles, it, suggests, that, other, hypothetical, scalar, fields, suggested, by, other, theories, from, the, inflaton, to, quintessence, could, perhaps, exist, as, well, there, has, been, considerable, scientific, research, on, possible, links, between, the, higgs, field, and, the, inflaton, a, hypothetical, field, suggested, as, the, explanation, for, the, expansion, of, space, during, the, first, fraction, of, a, second, of, the, universe, known, as, the, inflationary, epoch, some, theories, suggest, that, a, fundamental, scalar, field, might, be, responsible, for, this, phenomenon, the, higgs, field, is, such, a, field, and, its, existence, has, led, to, papers, analysing, whether, it, could, also, be, the, inflaton, responsible, for, this, exponential, expansion, of, the, universe, during, the, big, bang, such, theories, are, highly, tentative, and, face, significant, problems, related, to, unitarity, but, may, be, viable, if, combined, with, additional, features, such, as, large, non, minimal, coupling, a, brans, dicke, scalar, or, other, new, physics, and, they, have, received, treatments, suggesting, that, higgs, inflation, models, are, still, of, interest, theoretically, in, the, standard, model, there, exists, the, possibility, that, the, underlying, state, of, our, universe, known, as, the, vacuum, is, long, lived, but, not, completely, stable, in, this, scenario, the, universe, as, we, know, it, could, effectively, be, destroyed, by, collapsing, into, a, more, stable, vacuum, state, this, was, sometimes, misreported, as, the, higgs, boson, ending, the, universe, if, the, masses, of, the, higgs, boson, and, top, quark, are, known, more, precisely, and, the, standard, model, provides, an, accurate, description, of, particle, physics, up, to, extreme, energies, of, the, planck, scale, then, it, is, possible, to, calculate, whether, the, vacuum, is, stable, or, merely, long, lived, a, higgs, mass, of, 125, 127, gev, c, 2, seems, to, be, extremely, close, to, the, boundary, for, stability, but, a, definitive, answer, requires, much, more, precise, measurements, of, the, pole, mass, of, the, top, quark, new, physics, can, change, this, picture, if, measurements, of, the, higgs, boson, suggest, that, our, universe, lies, within, a, false, vacuum, of, this, kind, then, it, would, imply, more, than, likely, in, many, billions, of, years, that, the, universe, s, forces, particles, and, structures, could, cease, to, exist, as, we, know, them, and, be, replaced, by, different, ones, if, a, true, vacuum, happened, to, nucleate, it, also, suggests, that, the, higgs, self, coupling, and, its, function, could, be, very, close, to, zero, at, the, planck, scale, with, intriguing, implications, including, theories, of, gravity, and, higgs, based, inflation, 218, a, future, electron, positron, collider, would, be, able, to, provide, the, precise, measurements, of, the, top, quark, needed, for, such, calculations, more, speculatively, the, higgs, field, has, also, been, proposed, as, the, energy, of, the, vacuum, which, at, the, extreme, energies, of, the, first, moments, of, the, big, bang, caused, the, universe, to, be, a, kind, of, featureless, symmetry, of, undifferentiated, extremely, high, energy, in, this, kind, of, speculation, the, single, unified, field, of, a, grand, unified, theory, is, identified, as, or, modelled, upon, the, higgs, field, and, it, is, through, successive, symmetry, breakings, of, the, higgs, field, or, some, similar, field, at, phase, transitions, that, the, presently, known, forces, and, fields, of, the, universe, arise, the, relationship, if, any, between, the, higgs, field, and, the, presently, observed, vacuum, energy, density, of, the, universe, has, also, come, under, scientific, study, as, observed, the, present, vacuum, energy, density, is, extremely, close, to, zero, but, the, energy, densities, predicted, from, the, higgs, field, supersymmetry, and, other, current, theories, are, typically, many, orders, of, magnitude, larger, it, is, unclear, how, these, should, be, reconciled, this, cosmological, constant, problem, remains, a, major, unanswered, problem, in, physics, the, six, authors, of, the, 1964, prl, papers, who, received, the, 2010, j, j, sakurai, prize, for, their, work, from, left, to, right, kibble, guralnik, hagen, englert, brout, right, image, higgs, particle, physicists, study, matter, made, from, fundamental, particles, whose, interactions, are, mediated, by, exchange, particles, gauge, bosons, acting, as, force, carriers, at, the, beginning, of, the, 1960s, a, number, of, these, particles, had, been, discovered, or, proposed, along, with, theories, suggesting, how, they, relate, to, each, other, some, of, which, had, already, been, reformulated, as, field, theories, in, which, the, objects, of, study, are, not, particles, and, forces, but, quantum, fields, and, their, symmetries, 150, however, attempts, to, produce, quantum, field, models, for, two, of, the, four, known, fundamental, forces, the, electromagnetic, force, and, the, weak, nuclear, force, and, then, to, unify, these, interactions, were, still, unsuccessful, one, known, problem, was, that, gauge, invariant, approaches, including, non, abelian, models, such, as, yang, mills, theory, 1954, which, held, great, promise, for, unified, theories, also, seemed, to, predict, known, massive, particles, as, massless, goldstone, s, theorem, relating, to, continuous, symmetries, within, some, theories, also, appeared, to, rule, out, many, obvious, solutions, since, it, appeared, to, show, that, zero, mass, particles, known, as, goldstone, bosons, would, also, have, to, exist, that, simply, were, not, seen, according, to, guralnik, physicists, had, no, understanding, how, these, problems, could, be, overcome, particle, physicist, and, mathematician, peter, woit, summarised, the, state, of, research, at, the, time, yang, and, mills, work, on, non, abelian, gauge, theory, had, one, huge, problem, in, perturbation, theory, it, has, massless, particles, which, don, t, correspond, to, anything, we, see, one, way, of, getting, rid, of, this, problem, is, now, fairly, well, understood, the, phenomenon, of, confinement, realized, in, qcd, where, the, strong, interactions, get, rid, of, the, massless, gluon, states, at, long, distances, by, the, very, early, sixties, people, had, begun, to, understand, another, source, of, massless, particles, spontaneous, symmetry, breaking, of, a, continuous, symmetry, what, philip, anderson, realized, and, worked, out, in, the, summer, of, 1962, was, that, when, you, have, both, gauge, symmetry, and, spontaneous, symmetry, breaking, the, massless, nambu, goldstone, mode, can, combine, with, the, massless, gauge, field, modes, to, produce, a, physical, massive, vector, field, this, is, what, happens, in, superconductivity, a, subject, about, which, anderson, was, and, is, one, of, the, leading, experts, the, higgs, mechanism, is, a, process, by, which, vector, bosons, can, acquire, rest, mass, without, explicitly, breaking, gauge, invariance, as, a, byproduct, of, spontaneous, symmetry, breaking, initially, the, mathematical, theory, behind, spontaneous, symmetry, breaking, was, conceived, and, published, within, particle, physics, by, yoichiro, nambu, in, 1960, and, somewhat, anticipated, by, ernst, stueckelberg, in, 1938, and, the, concept, that, such, a, mechanism, could, offer, a, possible, solution, for, the, mass, problem, was, originally, suggested, in, 1962, by, philip, anderson, who, had, previously, written, papers, on, broken, symmetry, and, its, outcomes, in, superconductivity, anderson, concluded, in, his, 1963, paper, on, the, yang, mills, theory, that, considering, the, superconducting, analog, hese, two, types, of, bosons, seem, capable, of, canceling, each, other, out, leaving, finite, mass, bosons, and, in, march, 1964, abraham, klein, and, benjamin, lee, showed, that, goldstone, s, theorem, could, be, avoided, this, way, in, at, least, some, non, relativistic, cases, and, speculated, it, might, be, possible, in, truly, relativistic, cases, these, approaches, were, quickly, developed, into, a, full, relativistic, model, independently, and, almost, simultaneously, by, three, groups, of, physicists, by, fran, ois, englert, and, robert, brout, in, august, 1964, by, peter, higgs, in, october, 1964, and, by, gerald, guralnik, carl, hagen, and, tom, kibble, ghk, in, november, 1964, higgs, also, wrote, a, short, but, important, response, published, in, september, 1964, to, an, objection, by, gilbert, which, showed, that, if, calculating, within, the, radiation, gauge, goldstone, s, theorem, and, gilbert, s, objection, would, become, inapplicable, higgs, later, described, gilbert, s, objection, as, prompting, his, own, paper, properties, of, the, model, were, further, considered, by, guralnik, in, 1965, by, higgs, in, 1966, by, kibble, in, 1967, and, further, by, ghk, in, 1967, the, original, three, 1964, papers, demonstrated, that, when, a, gauge, theory, is, combined, with, an, additional, charged, scalar, field, that, spontaneously, breaks, the, symmetry, the, gauge, bosons, may, consistently, acquire, a, finite, mass, in, 1967, steven, weinberg, and, abdus, salam, independently, showed, how, a, higgs, mechanism, could, be, used, to, break, the, electroweak, symmetry, of, sheldon, glashow, s, unified, model, for, the, weak, and, electromagnetic, interactions, itself, an, extension, of, work, by, schwinger, forming, what, became, the, standard, model, of, particle, physics, weinberg, was, the, first, to, observe, that, this, would, also, provide, mass, terms, for, the, fermions, at, first, these, seminal, papers, on, spontaneous, breaking, of, gauge, symmetries, were, largely, ignored, because, it, was, widely, believed, that, the, non, abelian, gauge, theories, in, question, were, a, dead, end, and, in, particular, that, they, could, not, be, renormalised, in, 1971, 72, martinus, veltman, and, gerard, t, hooft, proved, renormalisation, of, yang, mills, was, possible, in, two, papers, covering, massless, and, then, massive, fields, their, contribution, and, the, work, of, others, on, the, renormalisation, group, including, substantial, theoretical, work, by, russian, physicists, ludvig, faddeev, andrei, slavnov, efim, fradkin, and, igor, tyutin, was, eventually, enormously, profound, and, influential, but, even, with, all, key, elements, of, the, eventual, theory, published, there, was, still, almost, no, wider, interest, for, example, coleman, found, in, a, study, that, essentially, no, one, paid, any, attention, to, weinberg, s, paper, prior, to, 1971, and, discussed, by, david, politzer, in, his, 2004, nobel, speech, now, the, most, cited, in, particle, physics, and, even, in, 1970, according, to, politzer, glashow, s, teaching, of, the, weak, interaction, contained, no, mention, of, weinberg, s, salam, s, or, glashow, s, own, work, in, practice, politzer, states, almost, everyone, learned, of, the, theory, due, to, physicist, benjamin, lee, who, combined, the, work, of, veltman, and, t, hooft, with, insights, by, others, and, popularised, the, completed, theory, in, this, way, from, 1971, interest, and, acceptance, exploded, and, the, ideas, were, quickly, absorbed, in, the, mainstream, the, resulting, electroweak, theory, and, standard, model, have, accurately, predicted, among, other, things, weak, neutral, currents, three, bosons, the, top, and, charm, quarks, and, with, great, precision, the, mass, and, other, properties, of, some, of, these, many, of, those, involved, eventually, won, nobel, prizes, or, other, renowned, awards, a, 1974, paper, and, comprehensive, review, in, reviews, of, modern, physics, commented, that, while, no, one, doubted, the, correctness, of, these, arguments, no, one, quite, believed, that, nature, was, diabolically, clever, enough, to, take, advantage, of, them, adding, that, the, theory, had, so, far, produced, accurate, answers, that, accorded, with, experiment, but, it, was, unknown, whether, the, theory, was, fundamentally, correct, by, 1986, and, again, in, the, 1990s, it, became, possible, to, write, that, understanding, and, proving, the, higgs, sector, of, the, standard, model, was, the, central, problem, today, in, particle, physics, the, three, papers, written, in, 1964, were, each, recognised, as, milestone, papers, during, physical, review, letters, s, 50th, anniversary, celebration, their, six, authors, were, also, awarded, the, 2010, j, j, sakurai, prize, for, theoretical, particle, physics, for, this, work, a, controversy, also, arose, the, same, year, because, in, the, event, of, a, nobel, prize, only, up, to, three, scientists, could, be, recognised, with, six, being, credited, for, the, papers, two, of, the, three, prl, papers, by, higgs, and, by, ghk, contained, equations, for, the, hypothetical, field, that, eventually, would, become, known, as, the, higgs, field, and, its, hypothetical, quantum, the, higgs, boson, higgs, subsequent, 1966, paper, showed, the, decay, mechanism, of, the, boson, only, a, massive, boson, can, decay, and, the, decays, can, prove, the, mechanism, in, the, paper, by, higgs, the, boson, is, massive, and, in, a, closing, sentence, higgs, writes, that, an, essential, feature, of, the, theory, is, the, prediction, of, incomplete, multiplets, of, scalar, and, vector, bosons, frank, close, comments, that, 1960s, gauge, theorists, were, focused, on, the, problem, of, massless, vector, bosons, and, the, implied, existence, of, a, massive, scalar, boson, was, not, seen, as, important, only, higgs, directly, addressed, it, 154, 166, 175, in, the, paper, by, ghk, the, boson, is, massless, and, decoupled, from, the, massive, states, in, reviews, dated, 2009, and, 2011, guralnik, states, that, in, the, ghk, model, the, boson, is, massless, only, in, a, lowest, order, approximation, but, it, is, not, subject, to, any, constraint, and, acquires, mass, at, higher, orders, and, adds, that, the, ghk, paper, was, the, only, one, to, show, that, there, are, no, massless, goldstone, bosons, in, the, model, and, to, give, a, complete, analysis, of, the, general, higgs, mechanism, all, three, reached, similar, conclusions, despite, their, very, different, approaches, higgs, paper, essentially, used, classical, techniques, englert, and, brout, s, involved, calculating, vacuum, polarisation, in, perturbation, theory, around, an, assumed, symmetry, breaking, vacuum, state, and, ghk, used, operator, formalism, and, conservation, laws, to, explore, in, depth, the, ways, in, which, goldstone, s, theorem, may, be, worked, around, some, versions, of, the, theory, predicted, more, than, one, kind, of, higgs, fields, and, bosons, and, alternative, higgsless, models, were, considered, until, the, discovery, of, the, higgs, boson, to, produce, higgs, bosons, two, beams, of, particles, are, accelerated, to, very, high, energies, and, allowed, to, collide, within, a, particle, detector, occasionally, although, rarely, a, higgs, boson, will, be, created, fleetingly, as, part, of, the, collision, byproducts, because, the, higgs, boson, decays, very, quickly, particle, detectors, cannot, detect, it, directly, instead, the, detectors, register, all, the, decay, products, the, decay, signature, and, from, the, data, the, decay, process, is, reconstructed, if, the, observed, decay, products, match, a, possible, decay, process, known, as, a, decay, channel, of, a, higgs, boson, this, indicates, that, a, higgs, boson, may, have, been, created, in, practice, many, processes, may, produce, similar, decay, signatures, fortunately, the, standard, model, precisely, predicts, the, likelihood, of, each, of, these, and, each, known, process, occurring, so, if, the, detector, detects, more, decay, signatures, consistently, matching, a, higgs, boson, than, would, otherwise, be, expected, if, higgs, bosons, did, not, exist, then, this, would, be, strong, evidence, that, the, higgs, boson, exists, because, higgs, boson, production, in, a, particle, collision, is, likely, to, be, very, rare, 1, in, 10, billion, at, the, lhc, and, many, other, possible, collision, events, can, have, similar, decay, signatures, the, data, of, hundreds, of, trillions, of, collisions, needs, to, be, analysed, and, must, show, the, same, picture, before, a, conclusion, about, the, existence, of, the, higgs, boson, can, be, reached, to, conclude, that, a, new, particle, has, been, found, particle, physicists, require, that, the, statistical, analysis, of, two, independent, particle, detectors, each, indicate, that, there, is, less, than, a, one, in, a, million, chance, that, the, observed, decay, signatures, are, due, to, just, background, random, standard, model, events, i, e, that, the, observed, number, of, events, is, more, than, five, standard, deviations, sigma, different, from, that, expected, if, there, was, no, new, particle, more, collision, data, allows, better, confirmation, of, the, physical, properties, of, any, new, particle, observed, and, allows, physicists, to, decide, whether, it, is, indeed, a, higgs, boson, as, described, by, the, standard, model, or, some, other, hypothetical, new, particle, to, find, the, higgs, boson, a, powerful, particle, accelerator, was, needed, because, higgs, bosons, might, not, be, seen, in, lower, energy, experiments, the, collider, needed, to, have, a, high, luminosity, in, order, to, ensure, enough, collisions, were, seen, for, conclusions, to, be, drawn, finally, advanced, computing, facilities, were, needed, to, process, the, vast, amount, of, data, 25, petabytes, per, year, as, of, 2012, produced, by, the, collisions, for, the, announcement, of, 4, july, 2012, a, new, collider, known, as, the, large, hadron, collider, was, constructed, at, cern, with, a, planned, eventual, collision, energy, of, 14, tev, over, seven, times, any, previous, collider, and, over, 300, trillion, 3, 10, 14, lhc, proton, proton, collisions, were, analysed, by, the, lhc, computing, grid, the, world, s, largest, computing, grid, as, of, 2012, comprising, over, 170, computing, facilities, in, a, worldwide, network, across, 36, countries, the, first, extensive, search, for, the, higgs, boson, was, conducted, at, the, large, electron, positron, collider, lep, at, cern, in, the, 1990s, at, the, end, of, its, service, in, 2000, lep, had, found, no, conclusive, evidence, for, the, higgs, this, implied, that, if, the, higgs, boson, were, to, exist, it, would, have, to, be, heavier, than, 114, 4, gev, c, 2, the, search, continued, at, fermilab, in, the, united, states, where, the, tevatron, the, collider, that, discovered, the, top, quark, in, 1995, had, been, upgraded, for, this, purpose, there, was, no, guarantee, that, the, tevatron, would, be, able, to, find, the, higgs, but, it, was, the, only, supercollider, that, was, operational, since, the, large, hadron, collider, lhc, was, still, under, construction, and, the, planned, superconducting, super, collider, had, been, cancelled, in, 1993, and, never, completed, the, tevatron, was, only, able, to, exclude, further, ranges, for, the, higgs, mass, and, was, shut, down, on, 30, september, 2011, because, it, no, longer, could, keep, up, with, the, lhc, the, final, analysis, of, the, data, excluded, the, possibility, of, a, higgs, boson, with, a, mass, between, 147, gev, c, 2, and, 180, gev, c, 2, in, addition, there, was, a, small, but, not, significant, excess, of, events, possibly, indicating, a, higgs, boson, with, a, mass, between, 115, gev, c, 2, and, 140, gev, c, 2, the, large, hadron, collider, at, cern, in, switzerland, was, designed, specifically, to, be, able, to, either, confirm, or, exclude, the, existence, of, the, higgs, boson, built, in, a, 27, km, tunnel, under, the, ground, near, geneva, originally, inhabited, by, lep, it, was, designed, to, collide, two, beams, of, protons, initially, at, energies, of, 3, 5, tev, per, beam, 7, tev, total, or, almost, 3, 6, times, that, of, the, tevatron, and, upgradeable, to, 2, 7, tev, 14, tev, total, in, future, theory, suggested, if, the, higgs, boson, existed, collisions, at, these, energy, levels, should, be, able, to, reveal, it, as, one, of, the, most, complicated, scientific, instruments, ever, built, its, operational, readiness, was, delayed, for, 14, months, by, a, magnet, quench, event, nine, days, after, its, inaugural, tests, caused, by, a, faulty, electrical, connection, that, damaged, over, 50, superconducting, magnets, and, contaminated, the, vacuum, system, data, collection, at, the, lhc, finally, commenced, in, march, 2010, by, december, 2011, the, two, main, particle, detectors, at, the, lhc, atlas, and, cms, had, narrowed, down, the, mass, range, where, the, higgs, could, exist, to, around, 116, 130, gev, c, 2, atlas, and, 115, 127, gev, c, 2, cms, there, had, also, already, been, a, number, of, promising, event, excesses, that, had, evaporated, and, proven, to, be, nothing, but, random, fluctuations, however, from, around, may, 2011, both, experiments, had, seen, among, their, results, the, slow, emergence, of, a, small, yet, consistent, excess, of, gamma, and, 4, lepton, decay, signatures, and, several, other, particle, decays, all, hinting, at, a, new, particle, at, a, mass, around, 125, gev, c, 2, by, around, november, 2011, the, anomalous, data, at, 125, gev, c, 2, was, becoming, too, large, to, ignore, although, still, far, from, conclusive, and, the, team, leaders, at, both, atlas, and, cms, each, privately, suspected, they, might, have, found, the, higgs, on, 28, november, 2011, at, an, internal, meeting, of, the, two, team, leaders, and, the, director, general, of, cern, the, latest, analyses, were, discussed, outside, their, teams, for, the, first, time, suggesting, both, atlas, and, cms, might, be, converging, on, a, possible, shared, result, at, 125, gev, c, 2, and, initial, preparations, commenced, in, case, of, a, successful, finding, while, this, information, was, not, known, publicly, at, the, time, the, narrowing, of, the, possible, higgs, range, to, around, 115, 130, gev, 2, and, the, repeated, observation, of, small, but, consistent, event, excesses, across, multiple, channels, at, both, atlas, and, cms, in, the, 124, 126, gev, c, 2, region, described, as, tantalising, hints, of, around, 2, 3, sigma, were, public, knowledge, with, a, lot, of, interest, it, was, therefore, widely, anticipated, around, the, end, of, 2011, that, the, lhc, would, provide, sufficient, data, to, either, exclude, or, confirm, the, finding, of, a, higgs, boson, by, the, end, of, 2012, when, their, 2012, collision, data, with, slightly, higher, 8, tev, collision, energy, had, been, examined, on, 22, june, 2012, cern, announced, an, upcoming, seminar, covering, tentative, findings, for, 2012, and, shortly, afterwards, from, around, 1, july, 2012, according, to, an, analysis, of, the, spreading, rumour, in, social, media, rumours, began, to, spread, in, the, media, that, this, would, include, a, major, announcement, but, it, was, unclear, whether, this, would, be, a, stronger, signal, or, a, formal, discovery, speculation, escalated, to, a, fevered, pitch, when, reports, emerged, that, peter, higgs, who, proposed, the, particle, was, to, be, attending, the, seminar, and, that, five, leading, physicists, had, been, invited, generally, believed, to, signify, the, five, living, 1964, authors, with, higgs, englert, guralnik, hagen, attending, and, kibble, confirming, his, invitation, brout, having, died, in, 2011, on, 4, july, 2012, both, of, the, cern, experiments, announced, they, had, independently, made, the, same, discovery, cms, of, a, previously, unknown, boson, with, mass, 125, 3, 0, 6, gev, c, 2, and, atlas, of, a, boson, with, mass, 126, 0, 0, 6, gev, c, 2, using, the, combined, analysis, of, two, interaction, types, known, as, channels, both, experiments, independently, reached, a, local, significance, of, 5, sigma, implying, that, the, probability, of, getting, at, least, as, strong, a, result, by, chance, alone, is, less, than, one, in, three, million, when, additional, channels, were, taken, into, account, the, cms, significance, was, reduced, to, 4, 9, sigma, the, two, teams, had, been, working, blinded, from, each, other, from, around, late, 2011, or, early, 2012, meaning, they, did, not, discuss, their, results, with, each, other, providing, additional, certainty, that, any, common, finding, was, genuine, validation, of, a, particle, this, level, of, evidence, confirmed, independently, by, two, separate, teams, and, experiments, meets, the, formal, level, of, proof, required, to, announce, a, confirmed, discovery, on, 31, july, 2012, the, atlas, collaboration, presented, additional, data, analysis, on, the, observation, of, a, new, particle, including, data, from, a, third, channel, which, improved, the, significance, to, 5, 9, sigma, 1, in, 588, million, chance, of, obtaining, at, least, as, strong, evidence, by, random, background, effects, alone, and, mass, 126, 0, 0, 4, stat, 0, 4, sys, gev, c, 2, and, cms, improved, the, significance, to, 5, sigma, and, mass, 125, 3, 0, 4, stat, 0, 5, sys, gev, c, 2, following, the, 2012, discovery, it, was, still, unconfirmed, whether, the, 125, gev, c, 2, particle, was, a, higgs, boson, on, one, hand, observations, remained, consistent, with, the, observed, particle, being, the, standard, model, higgs, boson, and, the, particle, decayed, into, at, least, some, of, the, predicted, channels, moreover, the, production, rates, and, branching, ratios, for, the, observed, channels, broadly, matched, the, predictions, by, the, standard, model, within, the, experimental, uncertainties, however, the, experimental, uncertainties, currently, still, left, room, for, alternative, explanations, meaning, an, announcement, of, the, discovery, of, a, higgs, boson, would, have, been, premature, to, allow, more, opportunity, for, data, collection, the, lhc, s, proposed, 2012, shutdown, and, 2013, 14, upgrade, were, postponed, by, seven, weeks, into, 2013, in, november, 2012, in, a, conference, in, kyoto, researchers, said, evidence, gathered, since, july, was, falling, into, line, with, the, basic, standard, model, more, than, its, alternatives, with, a, range, of, results, for, several, interactions, matching, that, theory, s, predictions, physicist, matt, strassler, highlighted, considerable, evidence, that, the, new, particle, is, not, a, pseudoscalar, negative, parity, particle, consistent, with, this, required, finding, for, a, higgs, boson, evaporation, or, lack, of, increased, significance, for, previous, hints, of, non, standard, model, findings, expected, standard, model, interactions, with, w, and, z, bosons, absence, of, significant, new, implications, for, or, against, supersymmetry, and, in, general, no, significant, deviations, to, date, from, the, results, expected, of, a, standard, model, higgs, boson, however, some, kinds, of, extensions, to, the, standard, model, would, also, show, very, similar, results, so, commentators, noted, that, based, on, other, particles, that, are, still, being, understood, long, after, their, discovery, it, may, take, years, to, be, sure, and, decades, to, fully, understand, the, particle, that, has, been, found, these, findings, meant, that, as, of, january, 2013, scientists, were, very, sure, they, had, found, an, unknown, particle, of, mass, 125, gev, c, 2, and, had, not, been, misled, by, experimental, error, or, a, chance, result, they, were, also, sure, from, initial, observations, that, the, new, particle, was, some, kind, of, boson, the, behaviours, and, properties, of, the, particle, so, far, as, examined, since, july, 2012, also, seemed, quite, close, to, the, behaviours, expected, of, a, higgs, boson, even, so, it, could, still, have, been, a, higgs, boson, or, some, other, unknown, boson, since, future, tests, could, show, behaviours, that, do, not, match, a, higgs, boson, so, as, of, december, 2012, cern, still, only, stated, that, the, new, particle, was, consistent, with, the, higgs, boson, and, scientists, did, not, yet, positively, say, it, was, the, higgs, boson, despite, this, in, late, 2012, widespread, media, reports, announced, incorrectly, that, a, higgs, boson, had, been, confirmed, during, the, year, in, january, 2013, cern, director, general, rolf, dieter, heuer, stated, that, based, on, data, analysis, to, date, an, answer, could, be, possible, towards, mid, 2013, and, the, deputy, chair, of, physics, at, brookhaven, national, laboratory, stated, in, february, 2013, that, a, definitive, answer, might, require, another, few, years, after, the, collider, s, 2015, restart, in, early, march, 2013, cern, research, director, sergio, bertolucci, stated, that, confirming, spin, 0, was, the, major, remaining, requirement, to, determine, whether, the, particle, is, at, least, some, kind, of, higgs, boson, on, 14, march, 2013, cern, confirmed, the, following, cms, and, atlas, have, compared, a, number, of, options, for, the, spin, parity, of, this, particle, and, these, all, prefer, no, spin, and, even, parity, this, coupled, with, the, measured, interactions, of, the, new, particle, with, other, particles, strongly, indicates, that, it, is, a, higgs, boson, this, also, makes, the, particle, the, first, elementary, scalar, particle, to, be, discovered, in, nature, the, following, are, examples, of, tests, used, to, confirm, that, the, discovered, particle, is, the, higgs, boson, particularly, significant, we, should, observe, decays, into, pairs, of, photons, w, and, z, bosons, w, w, and, z, z, bottom, quarks, b, b, and, tau, leptons, among, the, possible, outcomes, in, july, 2017, cern, confirmed, that, all, measurements, still, agree, with, the, predictions, of, the, standard, model, and, called, the, discovered, particle, simply, the, higgs, boson, as, of, 2019, the, large, hadron, collider, has, continued, to, produce, findings, that, confirm, the, 2013, understanding, of, the, higgs, field, and, particle, the, lhc, s, experimental, work, since, restarting, in, 2015, has, included, probing, the, higgs, field, and, boson, to, a, greater, level, of, detail, and, confirming, whether, less, common, predictions, were, correct, in, particular, exploration, since, 2015, has, provided, strong, evidence, of, the, predicted, direct, decay, into, fermions, such, as, pairs, of, bottom, quarks, 3, 6, described, as, an, important, milestone, in, understanding, its, short, lifetime, and, other, rare, decays, and, also, to, confirm, decay, into, pairs, of, tau, leptons, 5, 9, this, was, described, by, cern, as, being, of, paramount, importance, to, establishing, the, coupling, of, the, higgs, boson, to, leptons, and, represents, an, important, step, towards, measuring, its, couplings, to, third, generation, fermions, the, very, heavy, copies, of, the, electrons, and, quarks, whose, role, in, nature, is, a, profound, mystery, published, results, as, of, 19, march, 2018, at, 13, tev, for, atlas, and, cms, had, their, measurements, of, the, higgs, mass, at, 124, 98, 0, 28, gev, c, 2, and, 125, 26, 0, 21, gev, c, 2, respectively, in, july, 2018, the, atlas, and, cms, experiments, reported, observing, the, higgs, boson, decay, into, a, pair, of, bottom, quarks, which, makes, up, approximately, 60, of, all, of, its, decays, gauge, invariance, is, an, important, property, of, modern, particle, theories, such, as, the, standard, model, partly, due, to, its, success, in, other, areas, of, fundamental, physics, such, as, electromagnetism, and, the, strong, interaction, quantum, chromodynamics, however, before, sheldon, glashow, extended, the, electroweak, unification, models, in, 1961, there, were, great, difficulties, in, developing, gauge, theories, for, the, weak, nuclear, force, or, a, possible, unified, electroweak, interaction, fermions, with, a, mass, term, would, violate, gauge, symmetry, and, therefore, cannot, be, gauge, invariant, this, can, be, seen, by, examining, the, dirac, lagrangian, for, a, fermion, in, terms, of, left, and, right, handed, components, we, find, none, of, the, spin, half, particles, could, ever, flip, helicity, as, required, for, mass, so, they, must, be, massless, w, and, z, bosons, are, observed, to, have, mass, but, a, boson, mass, term, contains, terms, which, clearly, depend, on, the, choice, of, gauge, and, therefore, these, masses, too, cannot, be, gauge, invariant, therefore, it, seems, that, none, of, the, standard, model, fermions, or, bosons, could, begin, with, mass, as, an, inbuilt, property, except, by, abandoning, gauge, invariance, if, gauge, invariance, were, to, be, retained, then, these, particles, had, to, be, acquiring, their, mass, by, some, other, mechanism, or, interaction, additionally, solutions, based, on, spontaneous, symmetry, breaking, appeared, to, fail, seemingly, an, inevitable, result, of, goldstone, s, theorem, because, there, is, no, potential, energy, cost, to, moving, around, the, complex, plane, s, circular, valley, responsible, for, spontaneous, symmetry, breaking, the, resulting, quantum, excitation, is, pure, kinetic, energy, and, therefore, a, massless, boson, goldstone, boson, which, in, turn, implies, a, new, long, range, force, but, no, new, long, range, forces, or, massless, particles, were, detected, either, so, whatever, was, giving, these, particles, their, mass, had, to, not, break, gauge, invariance, as, the, basis, for, other, parts, of, the, theories, where, it, worked, well, and, had, to, not, require, or, predict, unexpected, massless, particles, or, long, range, forces, which, did, not, actually, seem, to, exist, in, nature, a, solution, to, all, of, these, overlapping, problems, came, from, the, discovery, of, a, previously, unnoticed, borderline, case, hidden, in, the, mathematics, of, goldstone, s, theorem, that, under, certain, conditions, it, might, theoretically, be, possible, for, a, symmetry, to, be, broken, without, disrupting, gauge, invariance, and, without, any, new, massless, particles, or, forces, and, having, sensible, renormalisable, results, mathematically, this, became, known, as, the, higgs, mechanism, the, standard, model, hypothesises, a, field, which, is, responsible, for, this, effect, called, the, higgs, field, symbol, displaystyle, phi, which, has, the, unusual, property, of, a, non, zero, amplitude, in, its, ground, state, i, e, a, non, zero, vacuum, expectation, value, it, can, have, this, effect, because, of, its, unusual, mexican, hat, shaped, potential, whose, lowest, point, is, not, at, its, centre, in, simple, terms, unlike, all, other, known, fields, the, higgs, field, requires, less, energy, to, have, a, non, zero, value, than, a, zero, value, so, it, ends, up, having, a, non, zero, value, everywhere, below, a, certain, extremely, high, energy, level, the, existence, of, this, non, zero, vacuum, expectation, spontaneously, breaks, electroweak, gauge, symmetry, which, in, turn, gives, rise, to, the, higgs, mechanism, and, triggers, the, acquisition, of, mass, by, those, particles, interacting, with, the, field, this, effect, occurs, because, scalar, field, components, of, the, higgs, field, are, absorbed, by, the, massive, bosons, as, degrees, of, freedom, and, couple, to, the, fermions, via, yukawa, coupling, thereby, producing, the, expected, mass, terms, when, symmetry, breaks, under, these, conditions, the, goldstone, bosons, that, arise, interact, with, the, higgs, field, and, with, other, particles, capable, of, interacting, with, the, higgs, field, instead, of, becoming, new, massless, particles, the, intractable, problems, of, both, underlying, theories, neutralise, each, other, and, the, residual, outcome, is, that, elementary, particles, acquire, a, consistent, mass, based, on, how, strongly, they, interact, with, the, higgs, field, it, is, the, simplest, known, process, capable, of, giving, mass, to, the, gauge, bosons, while, remaining, compatible, with, gauge, theories, its, quantum, would, be, a, scalar, boson, known, as, the, higgs, boson, the, proposed, higgs, mechanism, arose, as, a, result, of, theories, proposed, to, explain, observations, in, superconductivity, a, superconductor, does, not, allow, penetration, by, external, magnetic, fields, the, meissner, effect, this, strange, observation, implies, that, somehow, the, electromagnetic, field, becomes, short, ranged, during, this, phenomenon, successful, theories, arose, to, explain, this, during, the, 1950s, first, for, fermions, ginzburg, landau, theory, 1950, and, then, for, bosons, bcs, theory, 1957, in, these, theories, superconductivity, is, interpreted, as, arising, from, a, charged, condensate, field, initially, the, condensate, value, does, not, have, any, preferred, direction, implying, it, is, scalar, but, its, phase, is, capable, of, defining, a, gauge, in, gauge, based, field, theories, to, do, this, the, field, must, be, charged, a, charged, scalar, field, must, also, be, complex, or, described, another, way, it, contains, at, least, two, components, and, a, symmetry, capable, of, rotating, each, into, the, other, s, in, na, ve, gauge, theory, a, gauge, transformation, of, a, condensate, usually, rotates, the, phase, but, in, these, circumstances, it, instead, fixes, a, preferred, choice, of, phase, however, it, turns, out, that, fixing, the, choice, of, gauge, so, that, the, condensate, has, the, same, phase, everywhere, also, causes, the, electromagnetic, field, to, gain, an, extra, term, this, extra, term, causes, the, electromagnetic, field, to, become, short, range, once, attention, was, drawn, to, this, theory, within, particle, physics, the, parallels, were, clear, a, change, of, the, usually, long, range, electromagnetic, field, to, become, short, ranged, within, a, gauge, invariant, theory, was, exactly, the, needed, effect, sought, for, the, weak, force, bosons, because, a, long, range, force, has, massless, gauge, bosons, and, a, short, ranged, force, implies, massive, gauge, bosons, suggesting, that, a, result, of, this, interaction, is, that, the, field, s, gauge, bosons, acquired, mass, or, a, similar, and, equivalent, effect, the, features, of, a, field, required, to, do, this, were, also, quite, well, defined, it, would, have, to, be, a, charged, scalar, field, with, at, least, two, components, and, complex, in, order, to, support, a, symmetry, able, to, rotate, these, into, each, other, the, minimal, standard, model, as, described, above, is, the, simplest, known, model, for, the, higgs, mechanism, with, just, one, higgs, field, however, an, extended, higgs, sector, with, additional, higgs, particle, doublets, or, triplets, is, also, possible, and, many, extensions, of, the, standard, model, have, this, feature, the, non, minimal, higgs, sector, favoured, by, theory, are, the, two, higgs, doublet, models, 2hdm, which, predict, the, existence, of, a, quintet, of, scalar, particles, two, cp, even, neutral, higgs, bosons, h, 0, and, h, 0, a, cp, odd, neutral, higgs, boson, a, 0, and, two, charged, higgs, particles, h, supersymmetry, susy, also, predicts, relations, between, the, higgs, boson, masses, and, the, masses, of, the, gauge, bosons, and, could, accommodate, a, 125, gev, c, 2, neutral, higgs, boson, the, key, method, to, distinguish, between, these, different, models, involves, study, of, the, particles, interactions, coupling, and, exact, decay, processes, branching, ratios, which, can, be, measured, and, tested, experimentally, in, particle, collisions, in, the, type, i, 2hdm, model, one, higgs, doublet, couples, to, up, and, down, quarks, while, the, second, doublet, does, not, couple, to, quarks, this, model, has, two, interesting, limits, in, which, the, lightest, higgs, couples, to, just, fermions, gauge, phobic, or, just, gauge, bosons, fermiophobic, but, not, both, in, the, type, ii, 2hdm, model, one, higgs, doublet, only, couples, to, up, type, quarks, the, other, only, couples, to, down, type, quarks, the, heavily, researched, minimal, supersymmetric, standard, model, mssm, includes, a, type, ii, 2hdm, higgs, sector, so, it, could, be, disproven, by, evidence, of, a, type, i, 2hdm, higgs, in, other, models, the, higgs, scalar, is, a, composite, particle, for, example, in, technicolour, the, role, of, the, higgs, field, is, played, by, strongly, bound, pairs, of, fermions, called, techniquarks, other, models, feature, pairs, of, top, quarks, see, top, quark, condensate, in, yet, other, models, there, is, no, higgs, field, at, all, and, the, electroweak, symmetry, is, broken, using, extra, dimensions, the, standard, model, leaves, the, mass, of, the, higgs, boson, as, a, parameter, to, be, measured, rather, than, a, value, to, be, calculated, this, is, seen, as, theoretically, unsatisfactory, particularly, as, quantum, corrections, related, to, interactions, with, virtual, particles, should, apparently, cause, the, higgs, particle, to, have, a, mass, immensely, higher, than, that, observed, but, at, the, same, time, the, standard, model, requires, a, mass, of, the, order, of, 100, to, 1000, gev, c, 2, to, ensure, unitarity, in, this, case, to, unitarise, longitudinal, vector, boson, scattering, reconciling, these, points, appears, to, require, explaining, why, there, is, an, almost, perfect, cancellation, resulting, in, the, visible, mass, of, 125, gev, c, 2, and, it, is, not, clear, how, to, do, this, because, the, weak, force, is, about, 10, 32, times, stronger, than, gravity, and, linked, to, this, the, higgs, boson, s, mass, is, so, much, less, than, the, planck, mass, or, the, grand, unification, energy, it, appears, that, either, there, is, some, underlying, connection, or, reason, for, these, observations, which, is, unknown, and, not, described, by, the, standard, model, or, some, unexplained, and, extremely, precise, fine, tuning, of, parameters, however, at, present, neither, of, these, explanations, is, proven, this, is, known, as, a, hierarchy, problem, more, broadly, the, hierarchy, problem, amounts, to, the, worry, that, a, future, theory, of, fundamental, particles, and, interactions, should, not, have, excessive, fine, tunings, or, unduly, delicate, cancellations, and, should, allow, masses, of, particles, such, as, the, higgs, boson, to, be, calculable, the, problem, is, in, some, ways, unique, to, spin, 0, particles, such, as, the, higgs, boson, which, can, give, rise, to, issues, related, to, quantum, corrections, that, do, not, affect, particles, with, spin, a, number, of, solutions, have, been, proposed, including, supersymmetry, conformal, solutions, and, solutions, via, extra, dimensions, such, as, braneworld, models, there, are, also, issues, of, quantum, triviality, which, suggests, that, it, may, not, be, possible, to, create, a, consistent, quantum, field, theory, involving, elementary, scalar, particles, triviality, constraints, can, be, used, to, restrict, or, predict, parameters, such, as, the, higgs, boson, mass, this, can, also, lead, to, a, predictable, higgs, mass, in, asymptotic, safety, scenarios, in, the, standard, model, the, higgs, field, is, a, scalar, tachyonic, field, scalar, meaning, it, does, not, transform, under, lorentz, transformations, and, tachyonic, meaning, the, field, but, not, the, particle, has, imaginary, mass, and, in, certain, configurations, must, undergo, symmetry, breaking, it, consists, of, four, components, two, neutral, ones, and, two, charged, component, fields, both, of, the, charged, components, and, one, of, the, neutral, fields, are, goldstone, bosons, which, act, as, the, longitudinal, third, polarisation, components, of, the, massive, w, w, and, z, bosons, the, quantum, of, the, remaining, neutral, component, corresponds, to, and, is, theoretically, realised, as, the, massive, higgs, boson, this, component, can, interact, with, fermions, via, yukawa, coupling, to, give, them, mass, as, well, mathematically, the, higgs, field, has, imaginary, mass, and, is, therefore, a, tachyonic, field, while, tachyons, particles, that, move, faster, than, light, are, a, purely, hypothetical, concept, fields, with, imaginary, mass, have, come, to, play, an, important, role, in, modern, physics, under, no, circumstances, do, any, excitations, ever, propagate, faster, than, light, in, such, theories, the, presence, or, absence, of, a, tachyonic, mass, has, no, effect, whatsoever, on, the, maximum, velocity, of, signals, there, is, no, violation, of, causality, instead, of, faster, than, light, particles, the, imaginary, mass, creates, an, instability, any, configuration, in, which, one, or, more, field, excitations, are, tachyonic, must, spontaneously, decay, and, the, resulting, configuration, contains, no, physical, tachyons, this, process, is, known, as, tachyon, condensation, and, is, now, believed, to, be, the, explanation, for, how, the, higgs, mechanism, itself, arises, in, nature, and, therefore, the, reason, behind, electroweak, symmetry, breaking, although, the, notion, of, imaginary, mass, might, seem, troubling, it, is, only, the, field, and, not, the, mass, itself, that, is, quantised, therefore, the, field, operators, at, spacelike, separated, points, still, commute, or, anticommute, and, information, and, particles, still, do, not, propagate, faster, than, light, tachyon, condensation, drives, a, physical, system, that, has, reached, a, local, limit, and, might, naively, be, expected, to, produce, physical, tachyons, to, an, alternate, stable, state, where, no, physical, tachyons, exist, once, a, tachyonic, field, such, as, the, higgs, field, reaches, the, minimum, of, the, potential, its, quanta, are, not, tachyons, any, more, but, rather, are, ordinary, particles, such, as, the, higgs, boson, since, the, higgs, field, is, scalar, the, higgs, boson, has, no, spin, the, higgs, boson, is, also, its, own, antiparticle, is, cp, even, and, has, zero, electric, and, colour, charge, the, standard, model, does, not, predict, the, mass, of, the, higgs, boson, if, that, mass, is, between, 115, and, 180, gev, c, 2, consistent, with, empirical, observations, of, 125, gev, c, 2, then, the, standard, model, can, be, valid, at, energy, scales, all, the, way, up, to, the, planck, scale, 10, 19, gev, c, 2, it, should, be, the, only, particle, in, the, standard, model, that, remains, massive, even, at, high, energies, many, theorists, expect, new, physics, beyond, the, standard, model, to, emerge, at, the, tev, scale, based, on, unsatisfactory, properties, of, the, standard, model, the, highest, possible, mass, scale, allowed, for, the, higgs, boson, or, some, other, electroweak, symmetry, breaking, mechanism, is, 1, 4, tev, beyond, this, point, the, standard, model, becomes, inconsistent, without, such, a, mechanism, because, unitarity, is, violated, in, certain, scattering, processes, it, is, also, possible, although, experimentally, difficult, to, estimate, the, mass, of, the, higgs, boson, indirectly, in, the, standard, model, the, higgs, boson, has, a, number, of, indirect, effects, most, notably, higgs, loops, result, in, tiny, corrections, to, masses, of, the, w, and, z, bosons, precision, measurements, of, electroweak, parameters, such, as, the, fermi, constant, and, masses, of, the, w, and, z, bosons, can, be, used, to, calculate, constraints, on, the, mass, of, the, higgs, as, of, july, 2011, the, precision, electroweak, measurements, tell, us, that, the, mass, of, the, higgs, boson, is, likely, to, be, less, than, about, 161, gev, c, 2, at, 95, confidence, level, these, indirect, constraints, rely, on, the, assumption, that, the, standard, model, is, correct, it, may, still, be, possible, to, discover, a, higgs, boson, above, these, masses, if, it, is, accompanied, by, other, particles, beyond, those, accommodated, by, the, standard, model, the, lhc, cannot, directly, measure, the, higgs, boson, s, lifetime, due, to, its, extreme, brevity, it, is, predicted, as, 1, 56, 10, 22, s, based, on, the, predicted, decay, width, of, 4, 07, 10, 3, gev, however, it, can, be, measured, indirectly, based, upon, comparing, masses, measured, from, quantum, phenomena, occurring, in, the, on, shell, production, pathways, and, in, the, much, rarer, off, shell, production, pathways, derived, from, dalitz, decay, via, a, virtual, photon, h, using, this, technique, the, lifetime, of, the, higgs, boson, was, tentatively, measured, in, 2021, as, 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, 22, s, at, sigma, 3, 2, 1, in, 1000, significance, if, higgs, particle, theories, are, valid, then, a, higgs, particle, can, be, produced, much, like, other, particles, that, are, studied, in, a, particle, collider, this, involves, accelerating, a, large, number, of, particles, to, extremely, high, energies, and, extremely, close, to, the, speed, of, light, then, allowing, them, to, smash, together, protons, and, lead, ions, the, bare, nuclei, of, lead, atoms, are, used, at, the, lhc, in, the, extreme, energies, of, these, collisions, the, desired, esoteric, particles, will, occasionally, be, produced, and, this, can, be, detected, and, studied, any, absence, or, difference, from, theoretical, expectations, can, also, be, used, to, improve, the, theory, the, relevant, particle, theory, in, this, case, the, standard, model, will, determine, the, necessary, kinds, of, collisions, and, detectors, the, standard, model, predicts, that, higgs, bosons, could, be, formed, in, a, number, of, ways, although, the, probability, of, producing, a, higgs, boson, in, any, collision, is, always, expected, to, be, very, small, for, example, only, one, higgs, boson, per, 10, billion, collisions, in, the, large, hadron, collider, the, most, common, expected, processes, for, higgs, boson, production, are, quantum, mechanics, predicts, that, if, it, is, possible, for, a, particle, to, decay, into, a, set, of, lighter, particles, then, it, will, eventually, do, so, this, is, also, true, for, the, higgs, boson, the, likelihood, with, which, this, happens, depends, on, a, variety, of, factors, including, the, difference, in, mass, the, strength, of, the, interactions, etc, most, of, these, factors, are, fixed, by, the, standard, model, except, for, the, mass, of, the, higgs, boson, itself, for, a, higgs, boson, with, a, mass, of, 125, gev, c, 2, the, sm, predicts, a, mean, life, time, of, about, 1, 6, 10, 22, s, since, it, interacts, with, all, the, massive, elementary, particles, of, the, sm, the, higgs, boson, has, many, different, processes, through, which, it, can, decay, each, of, these, possible, processes, has, its, own, probability, expressed, as, the, branching, ratio, the, fraction, of, the, total, number, decays, that, follows, that, process, the, sm, predicts, these, branching, ratios, as, a, function, of, the, higgs, mass, see, plot, one, way, that, the, higgs, can, decay, is, by, splitting, into, a, fermion, antifermion, pair, as, general, rule, the, higgs, is, more, likely, to, decay, into, heavy, fermions, than, light, fermions, because, the, mass, of, a, fermion, is, proportional, to, the, strength, of, its, interaction, with, the, higgs, by, this, logic, the, most, common, decay, should, be, into, a, top, antitop, quark, pair, however, such, a, decay, would, only, be, possible, if, the, higgs, were, heavier, than, 346, gev, c, 2, twice, the, mass, of, the, top, quark, for, a, higgs, mass, of, 125, gev, c, 2, the, sm, predicts, that, the, most, common, decay, is, into, a, bottom, antibottom, quark, pair, which, happens, 57, 7, of, the, time, the, second, most, common, fermion, decay, at, that, mass, is, a, tau, antitau, pair, which, happens, only, about, 6, 3, of, the, time, another, possibility, is, for, the, higgs, to, split, into, a, pair, of, massive, gauge, bosons, the, most, likely, possibility, is, for, the, higgs, to, decay, into, a, pair, of, w, bosons, the, light, blue, line, in, the, plot, which, happens, about, 21, 5, of, the, time, for, a, higgs, boson, with, a, mass, of, 125, gev, c, 2, the, w, bosons, can, subsequently, decay, either, into, a, quark, and, an, antiquark, or, into, a, charged, lepton, and, a, neutrino, the, decays, of, w, bosons, into, quarks, are, difficult, to, distinguish, from, the, background, and, the, decays, into, leptons, cannot, be, fully, reconstructed, because, neutrinos, are, impossible, to, detect, in, particle, collision, experiments, a, cleaner, signal, is, given, by, decay, into, a, pair, of, z, bosons, which, happens, about, 2, 6, of, the, time, for, a, higgs, with, a, mass, of, 125, gev, c, 2, if, each, of, the, bosons, subsequently, decays, into, a, pair, of, easy, to, detect, charged, leptons, electrons, or, muons, decay, into, massless, gauge, bosons, i, e, gluons, or, photons, is, also, possible, but, requires, intermediate, loop, of, virtual, heavy, quarks, top, or, bottom, or, massive, gauge, bosons, the, most, common, such, process, is, the, decay, into, a, pair, of, gluons, through, a, loop, of, virtual, heavy, quarks, this, process, which, is, the, reverse, of, the, gluon, fusion, process, mentioned, above, happens, approximately, 8, 6, of, the, time, for, a, higgs, boson, with, a, mass, of, 125, gev, c, 2, much, rarer, is, the, decay, into, a, pair, of, photons, mediated, by, a, loop, of, w, bosons, or, heavy, quarks, which, happens, only, twice, for, every, thousand, decays, however, this, process, is, very, relevant, for, experimental, searches, for, the, higgs, boson, because, the, energy, and, momentum, of, the, photons, can, be, measured, very, precisely, giving, an, accurate, reconstruction, of, the, mass, of, the, decaying, particle, in, 2021, the, extremely, rare, dalitz, decay, was, tentatively, observed, into, two, leptons, electrons, or, muons, and, a, photon, via, virtual, photon, decay, this, can, happen, in, three, ways, higgs, to, virtual, photon, to, in, which, the, virtual, photon, has, very, small, but, nonzero, mass, higgs, to, z, boson, to, or, higgs, to, two, leptons, one, of, which, emits, a,

with, the, particle, and, field, is, the, higgs, boson, 168, and, higgs, field, for, some, time, the, particle, was, known, by, a, combination, of, its, prl, author, names, including, at, times, anderson, for, example, the, brout, englert, higgs, particle, the, anderson, higgs, particle, or, the, englert, brout, higgs, guralnik, hagen, kibble, mechanism, and, these, are, still, used, at, times, fuelled, in, part, by, the, issue, of, recognition, and, a, potential, shared, nobel, prize, the, most, appropriate, name, was, still, occasionally, a, topic, of, debate, until, 2013, higgs, himself, preferred, to, call, the, particle, either, by, an, acronym, of, all, those, involved, or, the, scalar, boson, or, the, so, called, higgs, particle, a, considerable, amount, has, been, written, on, how, higgs, name, came, to, be, exclusively, used, two, main, explanations, are, offered, the, first, is, that, higgs, undertook, a, step, which, was, either, unique, clearer, or, more, explicit, in, his, paper, in, formally, predicting, and, examining, the, particle, of, the, prl, papers, authors, only, the, paper, by, higgs, explicitly, offered, as, a, prediction, that, a, massive, particle, would, exist, and, calculated, some, of, its, properties, 167, he, was, therefore, the, first, to, postulate, the, existence, of, a, massive, particle, according, to, nature, physicist, and, author, frank, close, and, physicist, blogger, peter, woit, both, comment, that, the, paper, by, ghk, was, also, completed, after, higgs, and, brout, englert, were, submitted, to, physical, review, letters, 167, and, that, higgs, alone, had, drawn, attention, to, a, predicted, massive, scalar, boson, while, all, others, had, focused, on, the, massive, vector, bosons, 154, 166, 175, in, this, way, higgs, contribution, also, provided, experimentalists, with, a, crucial, concrete, target, needed, to, test, the, theory, however, in, higgs, view, brout, and, englert, did, not, explicitly, mention, the, boson, since, its, existence, is, plainly, obvious, in, their, work, 6, while, according, to, guralnik, the, ghk, paper, was, a, complete, analysis, of, the, entire, symmetry, breaking, mechanism, whose, mathematical, rigour, is, absent, from, the, other, two, papers, and, a, massive, particle, may, exist, in, some, solutions, 9, higgs, paper, also, provided, an, especially, sharp, statement, of, the, challenge, and, its, solution, according, to, science, historian, david, kaiser, the, alternative, explanation, is, that, the, name, was, popularised, in, the, 1970s, due, to, its, use, as, a, convenient, shorthand, or, because, of, a, mistake, in, citing, many, accounts, including, higgs, own, 7, credit, the, higgs, name, to, physicist, benjamin, lee, lee, was, a, significant, populariser, of, the, theory, in, its, early, days, and, habitually, attached, the, name, higgs, as, a, convenient, shorthand, for, its, components, from, 1972, and, in, at, least, one, instance, from, as, early, as, 1966, although, lee, clarified, in, his, footnotes, that, higgs, is, an, abbreviation, for, higgs, kibble, guralnik, hagen, brout, englert, his, use, of, the, term, and, perhaps, also, steven, weinberg, s, mistaken, cite, of, higgs, paper, as, the, first, in, his, seminal, 1967, paper, meant, that, by, around, 1975, 1976, others, had, also, begun, to, use, the, name, higgs, exclusively, as, a, shorthand, in, 2012, physicist, frank, wilczek, who, was, credited, for, naming, the, elementary, particle, the, axion, over, an, alternative, proposal, higglet, by, weinberg, endorsed, the, higgs, boson, name, stating, history, is, complicated, and, wherever, you, draw, the, line, there, will, be, somebody, just, below, it, the, higgs, boson, is, often, referred, to, as, the, god, particle, in, popular, media, outside, the, scientific, community, the, nickname, comes, from, the, title, of, the, 1993, book, on, the, higgs, boson, and, particle, physics, the, god, particle, if, the, universe, is, the, answer, what, is, the, question, by, physics, nobel, prize, winner, and, fermilab, director, leon, lederman, lederman, wrote, it, in, the, context, of, failing, us, government, support, for, the, superconducting, super, collider, a, partially, constructed, titanic, competitor, to, the, large, hadron, collider, with, planned, collision, energies, of, 2, 20, tev, that, was, championed, by, lederman, since, its, 1983, inception, and, shut, down, in, 1993, the, book, sought, in, part, to, promote, awareness, of, the, significance, and, need, for, such, a, project, in, the, face, of, its, possible, loss, of, funding, lederman, a, leading, researcher, in, the, field, writes, that, he, wanted, to, title, his, book, the, goddamn, particle, if, the, universe, is, the, answer, what, is, the, question, lederman, s, editor, decided, that, the, title, was, too, controversial, and, convinced, him, to, change, the, title, to, the, god, particle, if, the, universe, is, the, answer, what, is, the, question, while, media, use, of, this, term, may, have, contributed, to, wider, awareness, and, interest, many, scientists, feel, the, name, is, inappropriate, since, it, is, sensational, hyperbole, and, misleads, readers, the, particle, also, has, nothing, to, do, with, any, god, leaves, open, numerous, questions, in, fundamental, physics, and, does, not, explain, the, ultimate, origin, of, the, universe, higgs, an, atheist, was, reported, to, be, displeased, and, stated, in, a, 2008, interview, that, he, found, it, embarrassing, because, it, was, the, kind, of, misuse, which, i, think, might, offend, some, people, the, nickname, has, been, satirised, in, mainstream, media, as, well, science, writer, ian, sample, stated, in, his, 2010, book, on, the, search, that, the, nickname, is, universally, hate, by, physicists, and, perhaps, the, worst, derided, in, the, history, of, physics, but, that, according, to, lederman, the, publisher, rejected, all, titles, mentioning, higgs, as, unimaginative, and, too, unknown, lederman, begins, with, a, review, of, the, long, human, search, for, knowledge, and, explains, that, his, tongue, in, cheek, title, draws, an, analogy, between, the, impact, of, the, higgs, field, on, the, fundamental, symmetries, at, the, big, bang, and, the, apparent, chaos, of, structures, particles, forces, and, interactions, that, resulted, and, shaped, our, present, universe, with, the, biblical, story, of, babel, in, which, the, primordial, single, language, of, early, genesis, was, fragmented, into, many, disparate, languages, and, cultures, today, we, have, the, standard, model, which, reduces, all, of, reality, to, a, dozen, or, so, particles, and, four, forces, it, s, a, hard, won, simplicity, remarkably, accurate, but, it, is, also, incomplete, and, in, fact, internally, inconsistent, this, boson, is, so, central, to, the, state, of, physics, today, so, crucial, to, our, final, understanding, of, the, structure, of, matter, yet, so, elusive, that, i, have, given, it, a, nickname, the, god, particle, why, god, particle, two, reasons, one, the, publisher, wouldn, t, let, us, call, it, the, goddamn, particle, though, that, might, be, a, more, appropriate, title, given, its, villainous, nature, and, the, expense, it, is, causing, and, two, there, is, a, connection, of, sorts, to, another, book, a, much, older, one, lederman, asks, whether, the, higgs, boson, was, added, just, to, perplex, and, confound, those, seeking, knowledge, of, the, universe, and, whether, physicists, will, be, confounded, by, it, as, recounted, in, that, story, or, ultimately, surmount, the, challenge, and, understand, how, beautiful, is, the, universe, made, a, renaming, competition, by, british, newspaper, the, guardian, in, 2009, resulted, in, their, science, correspondent, choosing, the, name, the, champagne, bottle, boson, as, the, best, submission, the, bottom, of, a, champagne, bottle, is, in, the, shape, of, the, higgs, potential, and, is, often, used, as, an, illustration, in, physics, lectures, so, it, s, not, an, embarrassingly, grandiose, name, it, is, memorable, and, has, some, physics, connection, too, the, name, higgson, was, suggested, as, well, in, an, opinion, piece, in, the, institute, of, physics, online, publication, physicsworld, com, there, has, been, considerable, public, discussion, of, analogies, and, explanations, for, the, higgs, particle, and, how, the, field, creates, mass, including, coverage, of, explanatory, attempts, in, their, own, right, and, a, competition, in, 1993, for, the, best, popular, explanation, by, then, uk, minister, for, science, sir, william, waldegrave, and, articles, in, newspapers, worldwide, an, educational, collaboration, involving, an, lhc, physicist, and, a, high, school, teachers, at, cern, educator, suggests, that, dispersion, of, light, responsible, for, the, rainbow, and, dispersive, prism, is, a, useful, analogy, for, the, higgs, field, s, symmetry, breaking, and, mass, causing, effect, matt, strassler, uses, electric, fields, as, an, analogy, some, particles, interact, with, the, higgs, field, while, others, don, t, those, particles, that, feel, the, higgs, field, act, as, if, they, have, mass, something, similar, happens, in, an, electric, field, charged, objects, are, pulled, around, and, neutral, objects, can, sail, through, unaffected, so, you, can, think, of, the, higgs, search, as, an, attempt, to, make, waves, in, the, higgs, field, to, prove, it, s, really, there, a, similar, explanation, was, offered, by, the, guardian, the, higgs, boson, is, essentially, a, ripple, in, a, field, said, to, have, emerged, at, the, birth, of, the, universe, and, to, span, the, cosmos, to, this, day, the, particle, is, crucial, however, it, is, the, smoking, gun, the, evidence, required, to, show, the, theory, is, right, the, higgs, field, s, effect, on, particles, was, famously, described, by, physicist, david, miller, as, akin, to, a, room, full, of, political, party, workers, spread, evenly, throughout, a, room, the, crowd, gravitates, to, and, slows, down, famous, people, but, does, not, slow, down, others, he, also, drew, attention, to, well, known, effects, in, solid, state, physics, where, an, electron, s, effective, mass, can, be, much, greater, than, usual, in, the, presence, of, a, crystal, lattice, analogies, based, on, drag, effects, including, analogies, of, syrup, or, molasses, are, also, well, known, but, can, be, somewhat, misleading, since, they, may, be, understood, incorrectly, as, saying, that, the, higgs, field, simply, resists, some, particles, motion, but, not, others, a, simple, resistive, effect, could, also, conflict, with, newton, s, third, law, the, higgs, boson, is, commonly, misunderstood, as, responsible, for, mass, rather, than, the, higgs, field, and, as, relating, to, most, mass, in, the, universe, there, was, considerable, discussion, prior, to, late, 2013, of, how, to, allocate, the, credit, if, the, higgs, boson, is, proven, made, more, pointed, as, a, nobel, prize, had, been, expected, and, the, very, wide, basis, of, people, entitled, to, consideration, these, include, a, range, of, theoreticians, who, made, the, higgs, mechanism, theory, possible, the, theoreticians, of, the, 1964, prl, papers, including, higgs, himself, the, theoreticians, who, derived, from, these, a, working, electroweak, theory, and, the, standard, model, itself, and, also, the, experimentalists, at, cern, and, other, institutions, who, made, possible, the, proof, of, the, higgs, field, and, boson, in, reality, the, nobel, prize, has, a, limit, of, three, persons, to, share, an, award, and,
