in, astronomy, kepler, s, laws, of, planetary, motion, published, by, johannes, kepler, absent, the, third, law, in, 1609, and, fully, in, 1619, describe, the, orbits, of, planets, around, the, sun, the, laws, replaced, the, circular, orbits, and, epicycles, in, the, heliocentric, theory, of, nicolaus, copernicus, with, elliptical, orbits, and, explained, how, planetary, velocities, vary, the, three, laws, state, that, the, elliptical, orbits, of, planets, were, indicated, by, calculations, of, the, orbit, of, mars, from, this, kepler, inferred, that, other, bodies, in, the, solar, system, including, those, farther, away, from, the, sun, also, have, elliptical, orbits, the, second, law, establishes, that, when, a, planet, is, closer, to, the, sun, it, travels, faster, the, third, law, expresses, that, the, farther, a, planet, is, from, the, sun, the, longer, its, orbital, period, isaac, newton, showed, in, 1687, that, relationships, like, kepler, s, would, apply, in, the, solar, system, as, a, consequence, of, his, own, laws, of, motion, and, law, of, universal, gravitation, a, more, precise, historical, approach, is, found, in, astronomia, nova, and, epitome, astronomiae, copernicanae, johannes, kepler, s, laws, improved, the, model, of, copernicus, according, to, copernicus, despite, being, correct, in, saying, that, the, planets, revolved, around, the, sun, copernicus, was, incorrect, in, defining, their, orbits, introducing, physical, explanations, for, movement, in, space, beyond, just, geometry, kepler, correctly, defined, the, orbit, of, planets, as, follows, 53, 54, the, eccentricity, of, the, orbit, of, the, earth, makes, the, time, from, the, march, equinox, to, the, september, equinox, around, 186, days, unequal, to, the, time, from, the, september, equinox, to, the, march, equinox, around, 179, days, a, diameter, would, cut, the, orbit, into, equal, parts, but, the, plane, through, the, sun, parallel, to, the, equator, of, the, earth, cuts, the, orbit, into, two, parts, with, areas, in, a, 186, to, 179, ratio, so, the, eccentricity, of, the, orbit, of, the, earth, is, approximately, which, is, close, to, the, correct, value, 0, 016710218, the, accuracy, of, this, calculation, requires, that, the, two, dates, chosen, be, along, the, elliptical, orbit, s, minor, axis, and, that, the, midpoints, of, each, half, be, along, the, major, axis, as, the, two, dates, chosen, here, are, equinoxes, this, will, be, correct, when, perihelion, the, date, the, earth, is, closest, to, the, sun, falls, on, a, solstice, the, current, perihelion, near, january, 4, is, fairly, close, to, the, solstice, of, december, 21, or, 22, it, took, nearly, two, centuries, for, the, current, formulation, of, kepler, s, work, to, take, on, its, settled, form, voltaire, s, el, ments, de, la, philosophie, de, newton, elements, of, newton, s, philosophy, of, 1738, was, the, first, publication, to, use, the, terminology, of, laws, the, biographical, encyclopedia, of, astronomers, in, its, article, on, kepler, p, 620, states, that, the, terminology, of, scientific, laws, for, these, discoveries, was, current, at, least, from, the, time, of, joseph, de, lalande, it, was, the, exposition, of, robert, small, in, an, account, of, the, astronomical, discoveries, of, kepler, 1814, that, made, up, the, set, of, three, laws, by, adding, in, the, third, small, also, claimed, against, the, history, that, these, were, empirical, laws, based, on, inductive, reasoning, further, the, current, usage, of, kepler, s, second, law, is, something, of, a, misnomer, kepler, had, two, versions, related, in, a, qualitative, sense, the, distance, law, and, the, area, law, the, area, law, is, what, became, the, second, law, in, the, set, of, three, but, kepler, did, himself, not, privilege, it, in, that, way, kepler, published, his, first, two, laws, about, planetary, motion, in, 1609, having, found, them, by, analyzing, the, astronomical, observations, of, tycho, brahe, 53, kepler, s, third, law, was, published, in, 1619, kepler, had, believed, in, the, copernican, model, of, the, solar, system, which, called, for, circular, orbits, but, he, could, not, reconcile, brahe, s, highly, precise, observations, with, a, circular, fit, to, mars, orbit, mars, coincidentally, having, the, highest, eccentricity, of, all, planets, except, mercury, his, first, law, reflected, this, discovery, in, 1621, kepler, noted, that, his, third, law, applies, to, the, four, brightest, moons, of, jupiter, godefroy, wendelin, also, made, this, observation, in, 1643, the, second, law, in, the, area, law, form, was, contested, by, nicolaus, mercator, in, a, book, from, 1664, but, by, 1670, his, philosophical, transactions, were, in, its, favour, as, the, century, proceeded, it, became, more, widely, accepted, the, reception, in, germany, changed, noticeably, between, 1688, the, year, in, which, newton, s, principia, was, published, and, was, taken, to, be, basically, copernican, and, 1690, by, which, time, work, of, gottfried, leibniz, on, kepler, had, been, published, newton, was, credited, with, understanding, that, the, second, law, is, not, special, to, the, inverse, square, law, of, gravitation, being, a, consequence, just, of, the, radial, nature, of, that, law, whereas, the, other, laws, do, depend, on, the, inverse, square, form, of, the, attraction, carl, runge, and, wilhelm, lenz, much, later, identified, a, symmetry, principle, in, the, phase, space, of, planetary, motion, the, orthogonal, group, o, 4, acting, which, accounts, for, the, first, and, third, laws, in, the, case, of, newtonian, gravitation, as, conservation, of, angular, momentum, does, via, rotational, symmetry, for, the, second, law, the, mathematical, model, of, the, kinematics, of, a, planet, subject, to, the, laws, allows, a, large, range, of, further, calculations, kepler, s, first, law, states, that, the, orbit, of, every, planet, is, an, ellipse, with, the, sun, at, one, of, the, two, foci, mathematically, an, ellipse, can, be, represented, by, the, formula, where, p, displaystyle, p, is, the, semi, latus, rectum, is, the, eccentricity, of, the, ellipse, r, is, the, distance, from, the, sun, to, the, planet, and, is, the, angle, to, the, planet, s, current, position, from, its, closest, approach, as, seen, from, the, sun, so, r, are, polar, coordinates, for, an, ellipse, 0, 1, in, the, limiting, case, 0, the, orbit, is, a, circle, with, the, sun, at, the, centre, i, e, where, there, is, zero, eccentricity, at, 0, perihelion, the, distance, is, minimum, at, 90, and, at, 270, the, distance, is, equal, to, p, displaystyle, p, at, 180, aphelion, the, distance, is, maximum, by, definition, aphelion, is, invariably, perihelion, plus, 180, the, semi, major, axis, a, is, the, arithmetic, mean, between, r, min, and, r, max, the, semi, minor, axis, b, is, the, geometric, mean, between, r, min, and, r, max, the, semi, latus, rectum, p, is, the, harmonic, mean, between, r, min, and, r, max, the, eccentricity, is, the, coefficient, of, variation, between, r, min, and, r, max, the, area, of, the, ellipse, is, the, special, case, of, a, circle, is, 0, resulting, in, r, p, r, min, r, max, a, b, and, a, r, 2, kepler, s, second, law, states, that, a, line, joining, a, planet, and, the, sun, sweeps, out, equal, areas, during, equal, intervals, of, time, the, orbital, radius, and, angular, velocity, of, the, planet, in, the, elliptical, orbit, will, vary, this, is, shown, in, the, animation, the, planet, travels, faster, when, closer, to, the, sun, then, slower, when, farther, from, the, sun, kepler, s, second, law, states, that, the, blue, sector, has, constant, area, kepler, notably, arrived, at, this, law, through, assumptions, that, were, either, only, approximately, true, or, outright, false, and, can, be, outlined, as, follows, 1, planets, are, pushed, around, the, sun, by, a, force, from, the, sun, this, false, assumption, relies, on, incorrect, aristotelian, physics, that, an, object, needs, to, be, pushed, to, maintain, motion, 2, the, propelling, force, from, the, sun, is, inversely, proportional, to, the, distance, from, the, sun, kepler, reasoned, this, believing, that, gravity, spreading, in, three, dimensions, would, be, a, waste, since, the, planets, inhabited, a, plane, thus, an, inverse, instead, of, the, inverse, square, law, 3, because, kepler, believed, that, force, would, be, proportional, to, velocity, it, followed, from, statements, 1, and, 2, that, velocity, would, be, inverse, to, the, distance, from, the, sun, this, is, also, an, incorrect, tenet, of, aristotelian, physics, 4, since, velocity, is, inverse, to, time, the, distance, from, the, sun, would, be, proportional, to, the, time, to, cover, a, small, piece, of, the, orbit, this, is, approximately, true, for, elliptical, orbits, 5, the, area, swept, out, is, proportional, to, the, overall, time, this, is, also, approximately, true, 6, the, orbits, of, a, planet, are, circular, kepler, discovered, his, second, law, before, his, first, law, which, contradicts, this, nevertheless, the, result, of, the, second, law, is, exactly, true, as, it, is, logically, equivalent, to, the, conservation, of, angular, momentum, which, is, true, for, any, body, experiencing, a, radially, symmetric, force, a, correct, proof, can, be, shown, through, this, since, the, cross, product, of, two, vectors, gives, the, area, of, a, parallelogram, possessing, sides, of, those, vectors, the, triangular, area, da, swept, out, in, a, short, period, of, time, is, given, by, half, the, cross, product, of, the, r, and, dx, vectors, for, some, short, piece, of, the, orbit, dx, d, a, 1, 2, r, d, x, 1, 2, r, v, d, t, displaystyle, da, frac, 1, 2, vec, r, times, vec, dx, frac, 1, 2, vec, r, times, vec, v, dt, for, a, small, piece, of, the, orbit, dx, and, time, to, cover, it, dt, thus, d, a, d, t, 1, 2, r, v, displaystyle, frac, da, dt, frac, 1, 2, vec, r, times, vec, v, d, a, d, t, 1, m, 1, 2, r, p, displaystyle, frac, da, dt, frac, 1, m, frac, 1, 2, vec, r, times, vec, p, since, the, final, expression, is, proportional, to, the, total, angular, momentum, r, p, displaystyle, vec, r, times, vec, p, kepler, s, equal, area, law, will, hold, for, any, system, that, conserves, angular, momentum, since, any, radial, force, will, produce, no, torque, on, the, planet, s, motion, angular, momentum, will, be, conserved, in, a, small, time, d, t, displaystyle, dt, the, planet, sweeps, out, a, small, triangle, having, base, line, r, displaystyle, r, and, height, r, d, displaystyle, r, d, theta, and, area, d, a, 1, 2, r, r, d, textstyle, da, frac, 1, 2, cdot, r, cdot, r, d, theta, so, the, constant, areal, velocity, is, d, a, d, t, r, 2, 2, d, d, t, displaystyle, frac, da, dt, frac, r, 2, 2, frac, d, theta, dt, the, area, enclosed, by, the, elliptical, orbit, is, a, b, displaystyle, pi, ab, so, the, period, t, displaystyle, t, satisfies, and, the, mean, motion, of, the, planet, around, the, sun, satisfies, and, so, d, a, d, t, a, b, n, 2, a, b, t, displaystyle, frac, da, dt, frac, abn, 2, frac, pi, ab, t, s, sun, at, the, primary, focus, c, centre, of, ellipse, s, the, secondary, focus, in, each, case, the, area, of, all, sectors, depicted, is, identical, kepler, s, third, law, states, that, the, ratio, of, the, square, of, an, object, s, orbital, period, with, the, cube, of, the, semi, major, axis, of, its, orbit, is, the, same, for, all, objects, orbiting, the, same, primary, this, captures, the, relationship, between, the, distance, of, planets, from, the, sun, and, their, orbital, periods, kepler, enunciated, in, 1619, this, third, law, in, a, laborious, attempt, to, determine, what, he, viewed, as, the, music, of, the, spheres, according, to, precise, laws, and, express, it, in, terms, of, musical, notation, it, was, therefore, known, as, the, harmonic, law, the, original, form, of, this, law, referring, to, not, the, semi, major, axis, but, rather, a, mean, distance, holds, true, only, for, planets, with, small, eccentricities, near, zero, using, newton, s, law, of, gravitation, published, 1687, this, relation, can, be, found, in, the, case, of, a, circular, orbit, by, setting, the, centripetal, force, equal, to, the, gravitational, force, then, expressing, the, angular, velocity, in, terms, of, the, orbital, period, t, displaystyle, t, and, then, rearranging, results, in, kepler, s, third, law, a, more, detailed, derivation, can, be, done, with, general, elliptical, orbits, instead, of, circles, as, well, as, orbiting, the, center, of, mass, instead, of, just, the, large, mass, this, results, in, replacing, a, circular, radius, r, displaystyle, r, with, the, semi, major, axis, a, displaystyle, a, of, the, elliptical, relative, motion, of, one, mass, relative, to, the, other, as, well, as, replacing, the, large, mass, m, displaystyle, m, with, m, m, displaystyle, m, m, however, with, planet, masses, being, so, much, smaller, than, the, sun, this, correction, is, often, ignored, the, full, corresponding, formula, is, where, m, displaystyle, m, is, the, mass, of, the, sun, m, displaystyle, m, is, the, mass, of, the, planet, g, displaystyle, g, is, the, gravitational, constant, t, displaystyle, t, is, the, orbital, period, and, a, displaystyle, a, is, the, elliptical, semi, major, axis, and, au, displaystyle, text, au, is, the, astronomical, unit, the, average, distance, from, earth, to, the, sun, the, following, table, shows, the, data, used, by, kepler, to, empirically, derive, his, law, kepler, became, aware, of, john, napier, s, recent, invention, of, logarithms, and, log, log, graphs, before, he, discovered, the, pattern, upon, finding, this, pattern, kepler, wrote, i, first, believed, i, was, dreaming, but, it, is, absolutely, certain, and, exact, that, the, ratio, which, exists, between, the, period, times, of, any, two, planets, is, precisely, the, ratio, of, the, 3, 2th, power, of, the, mean, distance, for, comparison, here, are, modern, estimates, isaac, newton, computed, in, his, philosophi, naturalis, principia, mathematica, the, acceleration, of, a, planet, moving, according, to, kepler, s, first, and, second, laws, this, implies, that, the, sun, may, be, the, physical, cause, of, the, acceleration, of, planets, however, newton, states, in, his, principia, that, he, considers, forces, from, a, mathematical, point, of, view, not, a, physical, thereby, taking, an, instrumentalist, view, moreover, he, does, not, assign, a, cause, to, gravity, newton, defined, the, force, acting, on, a, planet, to, be, the, product, of, its, mass, and, the, acceleration, see, newton, s, laws, of, motion, so, the, sun, plays, an, unsymmetrical, part, which, is, unjustified, so, he, assumed, in, newton, s, law, of, universal, gravitation, as, the, planets, have, small, masses, compared, to, that, of, the, sun, the, orbits, conform, approximately, to, kepler, s, laws, newton, s, model, improves, upon, kepler, s, model, and, fits, actual, observations, more, accurately, see, two, body, problem, below, comes, the, detailed, calculation, of, the, acceleration, of, a, planet, moving, according, to, kepler, s, first, and, second, laws,
