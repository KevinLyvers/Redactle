yttrium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, y, and, atomic, number, 39, it, is, a, silvery, metallic, transition, metal, chemically, similar, to, the, lanthanides, and, has, often, been, classified, as, a, rare, earth, element, yttrium, is, almost, always, found, in, combination, with, lanthanide, elements, in, rare, earth, minerals, and, is, never, found, in, nature, as, a, free, element, 89, y, is, the, only, stable, isotope, and, the, only, isotope, found, in, the, earth, s, crust, the, most, important, present, day, use, of, yttrium, is, as, a, component, of, phosphors, especially, those, used, in, leds, historically, it, was, once, widely, used, in, the, red, phosphors, in, television, set, cathode, ray, tube, displays, yttrium, is, also, used, in, the, production, of, electrodes, electrolytes, electronic, filters, lasers, superconductors, various, medical, applications, and, tracing, various, materials, to, enhance, their, properties, yttrium, has, no, known, biological, role, exposure, to, yttrium, compounds, can, cause, lung, disease, in, humans, the, element, is, named, after, ytterbite, a, mineral, first, identified, in, 1787, by, the, chemist, carl, axel, arrhenius, he, named, the, mineral, after, the, village, of, ytterby, in, sweden, where, it, had, been, discovered, when, one, of, the, chemicals, in, ytterbite, was, later, found, to, be, a, previously, unidentified, element, the, element, was, then, named, yttrium, after, the, mineral, yttrium, is, a, soft, silver, metallic, lustrous, and, highly, crystalline, transition, metal, in, group, 3, as, expected, by, periodic, trends, it, is, less, electronegative, than, its, predecessor, in, the, group, scandium, and, less, electronegative, than, the, next, member, of, period, 5, zirconium, however, due, to, the, lanthanide, contraction, it, is, also, less, electronegative, than, its, successor, in, the, group, lutetium, yttrium, is, the, first, d, block, element, in, the, fifth, period, the, pure, element, is, relatively, stable, in, air, in, bulk, form, due, to, passivation, of, a, protective, oxide, y, 2, o, 3, film, that, forms, on, the, surface, this, film, can, reach, a, thickness, of, 10, m, when, yttrium, is, heated, to, 750, c, in, water, vapor, when, finely, divided, however, yttrium, is, very, unstable, in, air, shavings, or, turnings, of, the, metal, can, ignite, in, air, at, temperatures, exceeding, 400, c, yttrium, nitride, yn, is, formed, when, the, metal, is, heated, to, 1000, c, in, nitrogen, the, similarities, of, yttrium, to, the, lanthanides, are, so, strong, that, the, element, has, been, grouped, with, them, as, a, rare, earth, element, and, is, always, found, in, nature, together, with, them, in, rare, earth, minerals, chemically, yttrium, resembles, those, elements, more, closely, than, its, neighbor, in, the, periodic, table, scandium, and, if, physical, properties, were, plotted, against, atomic, number, it, would, have, an, apparent, number, of, 64, 5, to, 67, 5, placing, it, between, the, lanthanides, gadolinium, and, erbium, it, often, also, falls, in, the, same, range, for, reaction, order, resembling, terbium, and, dysprosium, in, its, chemical, reactivity, yttrium, is, so, close, in, size, to, the, so, called, yttrium, group, of, heavy, lanthanide, ions, that, in, solution, it, behaves, as, if, it, were, one, of, them, even, though, the, lanthanides, are, one, row, farther, down, the, periodic, table, than, yttrium, the, similarity, in, atomic, radius, may, be, attributed, to, the, lanthanide, contraction, one, of, the, few, notable, differences, between, the, chemistry, of, yttrium, and, that, of, the, lanthanides, is, that, yttrium, is, almost, exclusively, trivalent, whereas, about, half, the, lanthanides, can, have, valences, other, than, three, nevertheless, only, for, four, of, the, fifteen, lanthanides, are, these, other, valences, important, in, aqueous, solution, ce, iv, sm, ii, eu, ii, and, yb, ii, as, a, trivalent, transition, metal, yttrium, forms, various, inorganic, compounds, generally, in, the, oxidation, state, of, 3, by, giving, up, all, three, of, its, valence, electrons, a, good, example, is, yttrium, iii, oxide, y, 2, o, 3, also, known, as, yttria, a, six, coordinate, white, solid, yttrium, forms, a, water, insoluble, fluoride, hydroxide, and, oxalate, but, its, bromide, chloride, iodide, nitrate, and, sulfate, are, all, soluble, in, water, the, y, 3, ion, is, colorless, in, solution, because, of, the, absence, of, electrons, in, the, d, and, f, electron, shells, water, readily, reacts, with, yttrium, and, its, compounds, to, form, y, 2, o, 3, concentrated, nitric, and, hydrofluoric, acids, do, not, rapidly, attack, yttrium, but, other, strong, acids, do, with, halogens, yttrium, forms, trihalides, such, as, yttrium, iii, fluoride, yf, 3, yttrium, iii, chloride, ycl, 3, and, yttrium, iii, bromide, ybr, 3, at, temperatures, above, roughly, 200, c, similarly, carbon, phosphorus, selenium, silicon, and, sulfur, all, form, binary, compounds, with, yttrium, at, elevated, temperatures, organoyttrium, chemistry, is, the, study, of, compounds, containing, carbon, yttrium, bonds, a, few, of, these, are, known, to, have, yttrium, in, the, oxidation, state, 0, the, 2, state, has, been, observed, in, chloride, melts, and, 1, in, oxide, clusters, in, the, gas, phase, some, trimerization, reactions, were, generated, with, organoyttrium, compounds, as, catalysts, these, syntheses, use, ycl, 3, as, a, starting, material, obtained, from, y, 2, o, 3, and, concentrated, hydrochloric, acid, and, ammonium, chloride, hapticity, is, a, term, to, describe, the, coordination, of, a, group, of, contiguous, atoms, of, a, ligand, bound, to, the, central, atom, it, is, indicated, by, the, greek, character, eta, yttrium, complexes, were, the, first, examples, of, complexes, where, carboranyl, ligands, were, bound, to, a, d, 0, metal, center, through, a, 7, hapticity, vaporization, of, the, graphite, intercalation, compounds, graphite, y, or, graphite, y, 2, o, 3, leads, to, the, formation, of, endohedral, fullerenes, such, as, y, c, 82, electron, spin, resonance, studies, indicated, the, formation, of, y, 3, and, c, 82, 3, ion, pairs, the, carbides, y, 3, c, y, 2, c, and, yc, 2, can, be, hydrolyzed, to, form, hydrocarbons, yttrium, in, the, solar, system, was, created, through, stellar, nucleosynthesis, mostly, by, the, s, process, 72, but, also, by, the, r, process, 28, the, r, process, consists, of, rapid, neutron, capture, by, lighter, elements, during, supernova, explosions, the, s, process, is, a, slow, neutron, capture, of, lighter, elements, inside, pulsating, red, giant, stars, yttrium, isotopes, are, among, the, most, common, products, of, the, nuclear, fission, of, uranium, in, nuclear, explosions, and, nuclear, reactors, in, the, context, of, nuclear, waste, management, the, most, important, isotopes, of, yttrium, are, 91, y, and, 90, y, with, half, lives, of, 58, 51, days, and, 64, hours, respectively, though, 90, y, has, a, short, half, life, it, exists, in, secular, equilibrium, with, its, long, lived, parent, isotope, strontium, 90, 90, sr, with, a, half, life, of, 29, years, all, group, 3, elements, have, an, odd, atomic, number, and, therefore, few, stable, isotopes, scandium, has, one, stable, isotope, and, yttrium, itself, has, only, one, stable, isotope, 89, y, which, is, also, the, only, isotope, that, occurs, naturally, however, the, lanthanide, rare, earths, contain, elements, of, even, atomic, number, and, many, stable, isotopes, yttrium, 89, is, thought, to, be, more, abundant, than, it, otherwise, would, be, due, in, part, to, the, s, process, which, allows, enough, time, for, isotopes, created, by, other, processes, to, decay, by, electron, emission, neutron, proton, such, a, slow, process, tends, to, favor, isotopes, with, atomic, mass, numbers, a, protons, neutrons, around, 90, 138, and, 208, which, have, unusually, stable, atomic, nuclei, with, 50, 82, and, 126, neutrons, respectively, this, stability, is, thought, to, result, from, their, very, low, neutron, capture, cross, section, electron, emission, of, isotopes, with, those, mass, numbers, is, simply, less, prevalent, due, to, this, stability, resulting, in, them, having, a, higher, abundance, 89, y, has, a, mass, number, close, to, 90, and, has, 50, neutrons, in, its, nucleus, at, least, 32, synthetic, isotopes, of, yttrium, have, been, observed, and, these, range, in, atomic, mass, number, from, 76, to, 108, the, least, stable, of, these, is, 106, y, with, a, half, life, of, 150, ns, 76, y, has, a, half, life, of, 200, ns, and, the, most, stable, is, 88, y, with, a, half, life, of, 106, 626, days, apart, from, the, isotopes, 91, y, 87, y, and, 90, y, with, half, lives, of, 58, 51, days, 79, 8, hours, and, 64, hours, respectively, all, the, other, isotopes, have, half, lives, of, less, than, a, day, and, most, of, less, than, an, hour, yttrium, isotopes, with, mass, numbers, at, or, below, 88, decay, primarily, by, positron, emission, proton, neutron, to, form, strontium, z, 38, isotopes, yttrium, isotopes, with, mass, numbers, at, or, above, 90, decay, primarily, by, electron, emission, neutron, proton, to, form, zirconium, z, 40, isotopes, isotopes, with, mass, numbers, at, or, above, 97, are, also, known, to, have, minor, decay, paths, of, delayed, neutron, emission, yttrium, has, at, least, 20, metastable, excited, isomers, ranging, in, mass, number, from, 78, to, 102, multiple, excitation, states, have, been, observed, for, 80, y, and, 97, y, while, most, of, yttrium, s, isomers, are, expected, to, be, less, stable, than, their, ground, state, 78m, y, 84m, y, 85m, y, 96m, y, 98m1, y, 100m, y, and, 102m, y, have, longer, half, lives, than, their, ground, states, as, these, isomers, decay, by, beta, decay, rather, than, isomeric, transition, in, 1787, part, time, chemist, carl, axel, arrhenius, found, a, heavy, black, rock, in, an, old, quarry, near, the, swedish, village, of, ytterby, now, part, of, the, stockholm, archipelago, thinking, it, was, an, unknown, mineral, containing, the, newly, discovered, element, tungsten, he, named, it, ytterbite, and, sent, samples, to, various, chemists, for, analysis, johan, gadolin, at, the, university, of, bo, identified, a, new, oxide, or, earth, in, arrhenius, sample, in, 1789, and, published, his, completed, analysis, in, 1794, anders, gustaf, ekeberg, confirmed, the, identification, in, 1797, and, named, the, new, oxide, yttria, in, the, decades, after, antoine, lavoisier, developed, the, first, modern, definition, of, chemical, elements, it, was, believed, that, earths, could, be, reduced, to, their, elements, meaning, that, the, discovery, of, a, new, earth, was, equivalent, to, the, discovery, of, the, element, within, which, in, this, case, would, have, been, yttrium, friedrich, w, hler, is, credited, with, first, isolating, the, metal, in, 1828, by, reacting, a, volatile, chloride, that, he, believed, to, be, yttrium, chloride, with, potassium, in, 1843, carl, gustaf, mosander, found, that, samples, of, yttria, contained, three, oxides, white, yttrium, oxide, yttria, yellow, terbium, oxide, confusingly, this, was, called, erbia, at, the, time, and, rose, colored, erbium, oxide, called, terbia, at, the, time, a, fourth, oxide, ytterbium, oxide, was, isolated, in, 1878, by, jean, charles, galissard, de, marignac, new, elements, were, later, isolated, from, each, of, those, oxides, and, each, element, was, named, in, some, fashion, after, ytterby, the, village, near, the, quarry, where, they, were, found, see, ytterbium, terbium, and, erbium, in, the, following, decades, seven, other, new, metals, were, discovered, in, gadolin, s, yttria, since, yttria, was, found, to, be, a, mineral, and, not, an, oxide, martin, heinrich, klaproth, renamed, it, gadolinite, in, honor, of, gadolin, until, the, early, 1920s, the, chemical, symbol, yt, was, used, for, the, element, after, which, y, came, into, common, use, in, 1987, yttrium, barium, copper, oxide, was, found, to, achieve, high, temperature, superconductivity, it, was, only, the, second, material, known, to, exhibit, this, property, and, it, was, the, first, known, material, to, achieve, superconductivity, above, the, economically, important, boiling, point, of, nitrogen, yttrium, is, found, in, most, rare, earth, minerals, it, is, found, in, some, uranium, ores, but, is, never, found, in, the, earth, s, crust, as, a, free, element, about, 31, ppm, of, the, earth, s, crust, is, yttrium, making, it, the, 43rd, most, abundant, element, 615, yttrium, is, found, in, soil, in, concentrations, between, 10, and, 150, ppm, dry, weight, average, of, 23, ppm, and, in, sea, water, at, 9, ppt, lunar, rock, samples, collected, during, the, american, apollo, project, have, a, relatively, high, content, of, yttrium, yttrium, is, not, considered, a, bone, seeker, like, strontium, and, lead, normally, as, little, as, 0, 5, milligrams, 0, 0077, gr, is, found, in, the, entire, human, body, human, breast, milk, contains, 4, ppm, yttrium, can, be, found, in, edible, plants, in, concentrations, between, 20, ppm, and, 100, ppm, fresh, weight, with, cabbage, having, the, largest, amount, with, as, much, as, 700, ppm, the, seeds, of, woody, plants, have, the, highest, known, concentrations, as, of, april, 2018, there, are, reports, of, the, discovery, of, very, large, reserves, of, rare, earth, elements, in, the, deep, seabed, several, hundred, kilometers, from, the, tiny, japanese, island, of, minami, torishima, island, also, known, as, marcus, island, this, location, is, described, as, having, tremendous, potential, for, rare, earth, elements, and, yttrium, rey, according, to, a, study, published, in, scientific, reports, this, rey, rich, mud, has, great, potential, as, a, rare, earth, metal, resource, because, of, the, enormous, amount, available, and, its, advantageous, mineralogical, features, the, study, reads, the, study, shows, that, more, than, 16, million, short, tons, 15, billion, kilograms, of, rare, earth, elements, could, be, exploited, in, the, near, future, as, well, as, yttrium, y, which, is, used, in, products, like, camera, lenses, and, mobile, phone, screens, the, rare, earth, elements, found, are, europium, eu, terbium, tb, and, dysprosium, dy, as, yttrium, is, chemically, similar, to, lanthanides, it, occurs, in, the, same, ores, rare, earth, minerals, and, is, extracted, by, the, same, refinement, processes, a, slight, distinction, is, recognized, between, the, light, lree, and, the, heavy, rare, earth, elements, hree, but, the, distinction, is, not, perfect, yttrium, is, concentrated, in, the, hree, group, because, of, its, ion, size, though, it, has, a, lower, atomic, mass, rare, earth, elements, rees, come, mainly, from, four, sources, one, method, for, obtaining, pure, yttrium, from, the, mixed, oxide, ores, is, to, dissolve, the, oxide, in, sulfuric, acid, and, fractionate, it, by, ion, exchange, chromatography, with, the, addition, of, oxalic, acid, the, yttrium, oxalate, precipitates, the, oxalate, is, converted, into, the, oxide, by, heating, under, oxygen, by, reacting, the, resulting, yttrium, oxide, with, hydrogen, fluoride, yttrium, fluoride, is, obtained, when, quaternary, ammonium, salts, are, used, as, extractants, most, yttrium, will, remain, in, the, aqueous, phase, when, the, counter, ion, is, nitrate, the, light, lanthanides, are, removed, and, when, the, counter, ion, is, thiocyanate, the, heavy, lanthanides, are, removed, in, this, way, yttrium, salts, of, 99, 999, purity, are, obtained, in, the, usual, situation, where, yttrium, is, in, a, mixture, that, is, two, thirds, heavy, lanthanide, yttrium, should, be, removed, as, soon, as, possible, to, facilitate, the, separation, of, the, remaining, elements, annual, world, production, of, yttrium, oxide, had, reached, 600, tonnes, 660, short, tons, by, 2001, by, 2014, it, had, increased, to, 6, 400, tonnes, 7, 000, short, tons, global, reserves, of, yttrium, oxide, were, estimated, in, 2014, to, be, more, than, 450, 000, tonnes, 500, 000, short, tons, the, leading, countries, for, these, reserves, included, australia, brazil, china, india, and, the, united, states, only, a, few, tonnes, of, yttrium, metal, are, produced, each, year, by, reducing, yttrium,

superconductor, developed, at, the, university, of, alabama, in, huntsville, and, the, university, of, houston, in, 1987, this, superconductor, is, notable, because, the, operating, superconductivity, temperature, is, above, liquid, nitrogen, s, boiling, point, 77, 1, k, since, liquid, nitrogen, is, less, expensive, than, the, liquid, helium, required, for, metallic, superconductors, the, operating, costs, for, applications, would, be, less, the, actual, superconducting, material, is, often, written, as, yba, 2, cu, 3, o, 7, d, where, d, must, be, less, than, 0, 7, for, superconductivity, the, reason, for, this, is, still, not, clear, but, it, is, known, that, the, vacancies, occur, only, in, certain, places, in, the, crystal, the, copper, oxide, planes, and, chains, giving, rise, to, a, peculiar, oxidation, state, of, the, copper, atoms, which, somehow, leads, to, the, superconducting, behavior, the, theory, of, low, temperature, superconductivity, has, been, well, understood, since, the, bcs, theory, of, 1957, it, is, based, on, a, peculiarity, of, the, interaction, between, two, electrons, in, a, crystal, lattice, however, the, bcs, theory, does, not, explain, high, temperature, superconductivity, and, its, precise, mechanism, is, still, a, mystery, what, is, known, is, that, the, composition, of, the, copper, oxide, materials, must, be, precisely, controlled, for, superconductivity, to, occur, this, superconductor, is, a, black, and, green, multi, crystal, multi, phase, mineral, researchers, are, studying, a, class, of, materials, known, as, perovskites, that, are, alternative, combinations, of, these, elements, hoping, to, develop, a, practical, high, temperature, superconductor, yttrium, is, used, in, small, quantities, in, the, cathodes, of, some, lithium, iron, phosphate, battery, lfp, which, are, then, commonly, called, lifeypo, 4, chemistry, or, lyp, similar, to, lfp, lyp, batteries, offer, high, energy, density, good, safety, and, long, life, but, lyp, offers, higher, cathode, stability, and, prolongs, the, life, of, the, battery, by, protecting, the, physical, structure, of, the, cathode, especially, at, higher, temperatures, and, higher, charging, discharge, current, lyp, batteries, find, use, in, stationary, applications, off, grid, solar, systems, electric, vehicles, some, cars, as, well, other, applications, submarines, ships, similar, to, lfp, batteries, but, often, at, improved, safety, and, cycle, life, time, lyp, cells, have, essentially, the, same, nominal, voltage, as, lfp, 3, 25, v, but, the, maximum, charging, voltage, is, 4, 0, v, and, the, charging, and, discharge, characteristics, are, very, similar, in, 2009, professor, mas, subramanian, and, associates, at, oregon, state, university, discovered, that, yttrium, can, be, combined, with, indium, and, manganese, to, form, an, intensely, blue, non, toxic, inert, fade, resistant, pigment, yinmn, blue, the, first, new, blue, pigment, discovered, in, 200, years, yttrium, can, be, highly, toxic, to, humans, animals, and, plants, water, soluble, compounds, of, yttrium, are, considered, mildly, toxic, while, its, insoluble, compounds, are, non, toxic, in, experiments, on, animals, yttrium, and, its, compounds, caused, lung, and, liver, damage, though, toxicity, varies, with, different, yttrium, compounds, in, rats, inhalation, of, yttrium, citrate, caused, pulmonary, edema, and, dyspnea, while, inhalation, of, yttrium, chloride, caused, liver, edema, pleural, effusions, and, pulmonary, hyperemia, exposure, to, yttrium, compounds, in, humans, may, cause, lung, disease, workers, exposed, to, airborne, yttrium, europium, vanadate, dust, experienced, mild, eye, skin, and, upper, respiratory, tract, irritation, though, this, may, be, caused, by, the, vanadium, content, rather, than, the, yttrium, acute, exposure, to, yttrium, compounds, can, cause, shortness, of, breath, coughing, chest, pain, and, cyanosis, the, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, osha, limits, exposure, to, yttrium, in, the, workplace, to, 1, mg, m, 3, 5, 8, 10, 10, oz, cu, in, over, an, 8, hour, workday, the, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, niosh, recommended, exposure, limit, rel, is, 1, mg, m, 3, 5, 8, 10, 10, oz, cu, in, over, an, 8, hour, workday, at, levels, of, 500, mg, m, 3, 2, 9,
