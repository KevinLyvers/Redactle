infrared, ir, sometimes, called, infrared, light, is, electromagnetic, radiation, emr, with, wavelengths, longer, than, that, of, visible, light, but, shorter, than, microwaves, the, infrared, spectral, band, begins, with, waves, that, are, just, longer, than, those, of, red, light, the, longest, waves, in, the, visible, spectrum, so, ir, is, invisible, to, the, human, eye, ir, is, generally, understood, to, include, wavelengths, from, around, 750, nm, 400, thz, to, 1, mm, 300, ghz, ir, is, commonly, divided, between, longer, wavelength, thermal, ir, emitted, from, terrestrial, sources, and, shorter, wavelength, ir, or, near, ir, part, of, the, solar, spectrum, longer, ir, wavelengths, 30, 100, m, are, sometimes, included, as, part, of, the, terahertz, radiation, band, almost, all, black, body, radiation, from, objects, near, room, temperature, is, in, the, ir, band, as, a, form, of, electromagnetic, radiation, ir, carries, energy, and, momentum, exerts, radiation, pressure, and, has, properties, corresponding, to, both, those, of, a, wave, and, of, a, particle, the, photon, it, was, long, known, that, fires, emit, invisible, heat, in, 1681, the, pioneering, experimenter, edme, mariotte, showed, that, glass, though, transparent, to, sunlight, obstructed, radiant, heat, in, 1800, the, astronomer, sir, william, herschel, discovered, that, infrared, radiation, is, a, type, of, invisible, radiation, in, the, spectrum, lower, in, energy, than, red, light, by, means, of, its, effect, on, a, thermometer, slightly, more, than, half, of, the, energy, from, the, sun, was, eventually, found, through, herschel, s, studies, to, arrive, on, earth, in, the, form, of, infrared, the, balance, between, absorbed, and, emitted, infrared, radiation, has, an, important, effect, on, earth, s, climate, infrared, radiation, is, emitted, or, absorbed, by, molecules, when, changing, rotational, vibrational, movements, it, excites, vibrational, modes, in, a, molecule, through, a, change, in, the, dipole, moment, making, it, a, useful, frequency, range, for, study, of, these, energy, states, for, molecules, of, the, proper, symmetry, infrared, spectroscopy, examines, absorption, and, transmission, of, photons, in, the, infrared, range, infrared, radiation, is, used, in, industrial, scientific, military, commercial, and, medical, applications, night, vision, devices, using, active, near, infrared, illumination, allow, people, or, animals, to, be, observed, without, the, observer, being, detected, infrared, astronomy, uses, sensor, equipped, telescopes, to, penetrate, dusty, regions, of, space, such, as, molecular, clouds, to, detect, objects, such, as, planets, and, to, view, highly, red, shifted, objects, from, the, early, days, of, the, universe, infrared, thermal, imaging, cameras, are, used, to, detect, heat, loss, in, insulated, systems, to, observe, changing, blood, flow, in, the, skin, to, assist, firefighting, and, to, detect, the, overheating, of, electrical, components, military, and, civilian, applications, include, target, acquisition, surveillance, night, vision, homing, and, tracking, humans, at, normal, body, temperature, radiate, chiefly, at, wavelengths, around, 10, m, non, military, uses, include, thermal, efficiency, analysis, environmental, monitoring, industrial, facility, inspections, detection, of, grow, ops, remote, temperature, sensing, short, range, wireless, communication, spectroscopy, and, weather, forecasting, there, is, no, universally, accepted, definition, of, the, range, of, infrared, radiation, typically, it, is, taken, to, extend, from, the, nominal, red, edge, of, the, visible, spectrum, at, 700, nm, to, 1, mm, this, range, of, wavelengths, corresponds, to, a, frequency, range, of, approximately, 430, thz, down, to, 300, ghz, beyond, infrared, is, the, microwave, portion, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, increasingly, terahertz, radiation, is, counted, as, part, of, the, microwave, band, not, infrared, moving, the, band, edge, of, infrared, to, 0, 1, mm, 3, thz, sunlight, at, an, effective, temperature, of, 5, 780, k, 5, 510, c, 9, 940, f, is, composed, of, near, thermal, spectrum, radiation, that, is, slightly, more, than, half, infrared, at, zenith, sunlight, provides, an, irradiance, of, just, over, 1, kw, per, square, meter, at, sea, level, of, this, energy, 527, w, is, infrared, radiation, 445, w, is, visible, light, and, 32, w, is, ultraviolet, radiation, nearly, all, the, infrared, radiation, in, sunlight, is, near, infrared, shorter, than, 4, m, on, the, surface, of, earth, at, far, lower, temperatures, than, the, surface, of, the, sun, some, thermal, radiation, consists, of, infrared, in, the, mid, infrared, region, much, longer, than, in, sunlight, black, body, or, thermal, radiation, is, continuous, it, radiates, at, all, wavelengths, of, these, natural, thermal, radiation, processes, only, lightning, and, natural, fires, are, hot, enough, to, produce, much, visible, energy, and, fires, produce, far, more, infrared, than, visible, light, energy, in, general, objects, emit, infrared, radiation, across, a, spectrum, of, wavelengths, but, sometimes, only, a, limited, region, of, the, spectrum, is, of, interest, because, sensors, usually, collect, radiation, only, within, a, specific, bandwidth, thermal, infrared, radiation, also, has, a, maximum, emission, wavelength, which, is, inversely, proportional, to, the, absolute, temperature, of, object, in, accordance, with, wien, s, displacement, law, the, infrared, band, is, often, subdivided, into, smaller, sections, although, how, the, ir, spectrum, is, thereby, divided, varies, between, different, areas, in, which, ir, is, employed, infrared, radiation, is, generally, considered, to, begin, with, wavelengths, longer, than, visible, by, the, human, eye, there, is, no, hard, wavelength, limit, to, what, is, visible, as, the, eye, s, sensitivity, decreases, rapidly, but, smoothly, for, wavelengths, exceeding, about, 700, nm, therefore, wavelengths, just, longer, than, that, can, be, seen, if, they, are, sufficiently, bright, though, they, may, still, be, classified, as, infrared, according, to, usual, definitions, light, from, a, near, ir, laser, may, thus, appear, dim, red, and, can, present, a, hazard, since, it, may, actually, be, quite, bright, even, ir, at, wavelengths, up, to, 1, 050, nm, from, pulsed, lasers, can, be, seen, by, humans, under, certain, conditions, a, commonly, used, subdivision, scheme, is, nir, and, swir, together, is, sometimes, called, reflected, infrared, whereas, mwir, and, lwir, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, thermal, infrared, the, international, commission, on, illumination, cie, recommended, the, division, of, infrared, radiation, into, the, following, three, bands, iso, 20473, specifies, the, following, scheme, astronomers, typically, divide, the, infrared, spectrum, as, follows, these, divisions, are, not, precise, and, can, vary, depending, on, the, publication, the, three, regions, are, used, for, observation, of, different, temperature, ranges, and, hence, different, environments, in, space, the, most, common, photometric, system, used, in, astronomy, allocates, capital, letters, to, different, spectral, regions, according, to, filters, used, i, j, h, and, k, cover, the, near, infrared, wavelengths, l, m, n, and, q, refer, to, the, mid, infrared, region, these, letters, are, commonly, understood, in, reference, to, atmospheric, windows, and, appear, for, instance, in, the, titles, of, many, papers, a, third, scheme, divides, up, the, band, based, on, the, response, of, various, detectors, near, infrared, is, the, region, closest, in, wavelength, to, the, radiation, detectable, by, the, human, eye, mid, and, far, infrared, are, progressively, further, from, the, visible, spectrum, other, definitions, follow, different, physical, mechanisms, emission, peaks, vs, bands, water, absorption, and, the, newest, follow, technical, reasons, the, common, silicon, detectors, are, sensitive, to, about, 1, 050, nm, while, ingaas, s, sensitivity, starts, around, 950, nm, and, ends, between, 1, 700, and, 2, 600, nm, depending, on, the, specific, configuration, no, international, standards, for, these, specifications, are, currently, available, the, onset, of, infrared, is, defined, according, to, different, standards, at, various, values, typically, between, 700, nm, and, 800, nm, but, the, boundary, between, visible, and, infrared, light, is, not, precisely, defined, the, human, eye, is, markedly, less, sensitive, to, light, above, 700, nm, wavelength, so, longer, wavelengths, make, insignificant, contributions, to, scenes, illuminated, by, common, light, sources, particularly, intense, near, ir, light, e, g, from, lasers, leds, or, bright, daylight, with, the, visible, light, filtered, out, can, be, detected, up, to, approximately, 780, nm, and, will, be, perceived, as, red, light, intense, light, sources, providing, wavelengths, as, long, as, 1, 050, nm, can, be, seen, as, a, dull, red, glow, causing, some, difficulty, in, near, ir, illumination, of, scenes, in, the, dark, usually, this, practical, problem, is, solved, by, indirect, illumination, leaves, are, particularly, bright, in, the, near, ir, and, if, all, visible, light, leaks, from, around, an, ir, filter, are, blocked, and, the, eye, is, given, a, moment, to, adjust, to, the, extremely, dim, image, coming, through, a, visually, opaque, ir, passing, photographic, filter, it, is, possible, to, see, the, wood, effect, that, consists, of, ir, glowing, foliage, in, optical, communications, the, part, of, the, infrared, spectrum, that, is, used, is, divided, into, seven, bands, based, on, availability, of, light, sources, transmitting, absorbing, materials, fibers, and, detectors, the, c, band, is, the, dominant, band, for, long, distance, telecommunications, networks, the, s, and, l, bands, are, based, on, less, well, established, technology, and, are, not, as, widely, deployed, infrared, radiation, is, popularly, known, as, heat, radiation, but, light, and, electromagnetic, waves, of, any, frequency, will, heat, surfaces, that, absorb, them, infrared, light, from, the, sun, accounts, for, 49, of, the, heating, of, earth, with, the, rest, being, caused, by, visible, light, that, is, absorbed, then, re, radiated, at, longer, wavelengths, visible, light, or, ultraviolet, emitting, lasers, can, char, paper, and, incandescently, hot, objects, emit, visible, radiation, objects, at, room, temperature, will, emit, radiation, concentrated, mostly, in, the, 8, to, 25, m, band, but, this, is, not, distinct, from, the, emission, of, visible, light, by, incandescent, objects, and, ultraviolet, by, even, hotter, objects, see, black, body, and, wien, s, displacement, law, heat, is, energy, in, transit, that, flows, due, to, a, temperature, difference, unlike, heat, transmitted, by, thermal, conduction, or, thermal, convection, thermal, radiation, can, propagate, through, a, vacuum, thermal, radiation, is, characterized, by, a, particular, spectrum, of, many, wavelengths, that, are, associated, with, emission, from, an, object, due, to, the, vibration, of, its, molecules, at, a, given, temperature, thermal, radiation, can, be, emitted, from, objects, at, any, wavelength, and, at, very, high, temperatures, such, radiation, is, associated, with, spectra, far, above, the, infrared, extending, into, visible, ultraviolet, and, even, x, ray, regions, e, g, the, solar, corona, thus, the, popular, association, of, infrared, radiation, with, thermal, radiation, is, only, a, coincidence, based, on, typical, comparatively, low, temperatures, often, found, near, the, surface, of, planet, earth, the, concept, of, emissivity, is, important, in, understanding, the, infrared, emissions, of, objects, this, is, a, property, of, a, surface, that, describes, how, its, thermal, emissions, deviate, from, the, ideal, of, a, black, body, to, further, explain, two, objects, at, the, same, physical, temperature, may, not, show, the, same, infrared, image, if, they, have, differing, emissivity, for, example, for, any, pre, set, emissivity, value, objects, with, higher, emissivity, will, appear, hotter, and, those, with, a, lower, emissivity, will, appear, cooler, assuming, as, is, often, the, case, that, the, surrounding, environment, is, cooler, than, the, objects, being, viewed, when, an, object, has, less, than, perfect, emissivity, it, obtains, properties, of, reflectivity, and, or, transparency, and, so, the, temperature, of, the, surrounding, environment, is, partially, reflected, by, and, or, transmitted, through, the, object, if, the, object, were, in, a, hotter, environment, then, a, lower, emissivity, object, at, the, same, temperature, would, likely, appear, to, be, hotter, than, a, more, emissive, one, for, that, reason, incorrect, selection, of, emissivity, and, not, accounting, for, environmental, temperatures, will, give, inaccurate, results, when, using, infrared, cameras, and, pyrometers, infrared, is, used, in, night, vision, equipment, when, there, is, insufficient, visible, light, to, see, night, vision, devices, operate, through, a, process, involving, the, conversion, of, ambient, light, photons, into, electrons, that, are, then, amplified, by, a, chemical, and, electrical, process, and, then, converted, back, into, visible, light, infrared, light, sources, can, be, used, to, augment, the, available, ambient, light, for, conversion, by, night, vision, devices, increasing, in, the, dark, visibility, without, actually, using, a, visible, light, source, the, use, of, infrared, light, and, night, vision, devices, should, not, be, confused, with, thermal, imaging, which, creates, images, based, on, differences, in, surface, temperature, by, detecting, infrared, radiation, heat, that, emanates, from, objects, and, their, surrounding, environment, infrared, radiation, can, be, used, to, remotely, determine, the, temperature, of, objects, if, the, emissivity, is, known, this, is, termed, thermography, or, in, the, case, of, very, hot, objects, in, the, nir, or, visible, it, is, termed, pyrometry, thermography, thermal, imaging, is, mainly, used, in, military, and, industrial, applications, but, the, technology, is, reaching, the, public, market, in, the, form, of, infrared, cameras, on, cars, due, to, greatly, reduced, production, costs, thermographic, cameras, detect, radiation, in, the, infrared, range, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, roughly, 9, 000, 14, 000, nm, or, 9, 14, m, and, produce, images, of, that, radiation, since, infrared, radiation, is, emitted, by, all, objects, based, on, their, temperatures, according, to, the, black, body, radiation, law, thermography, makes, it, possible, to, see, one, s, environment, with, or, without, visible, illumination, the, amount, of, radiation, emitted, by, an, object, increases, with, temperature, therefore, thermography, allows, one, to, see, variations, in, temperature, hence, the, name, a, hyperspectral, image, is, a, picture, containing, continuous, spectrum, through, a, wide, spectral, range, at, each, pixel, hyperspectral, imaging, is, gaining, importance, in, the, field, of, applied, spectroscopy, particularly, with, nir, swir, mwir, and, lwir, spectral, regions, typical, applications, include, biological, mineralogical, defence, and, industrial, measurements, thermal, infrared, hyperspectral, imaging, can, be, similarly, performed, using, a, thermographic, camera, with, the, fundamental, difference, that, each, pixel, contains, a, full, lwir, spectrum, consequently, chemical, identification, of, the, object, can, be, performed, without, a, need, for, an, external, light, source, such, as, the, sun, or, the, moon, such, cameras, are, typically, applied, for, geological, measurements, outdoor, surveillance, and, uav, applications, in, infrared, photography, infrared, filters, are, used, to, capture, the, near, infrared, spectrum, digital, cameras, often, use, infrared, blockers, cheaper, digital, cameras, and, camera, phones, have, less, effective, filters, and, can, view, intense, near, infrared, appearing, as, a, bright, purple, white, color, this, is, especially, pronounced, when, taking, pictures, of, subjects, near, ir, bright, areas, such, as, near, a, lamp, where, the, resulting, infrared, interference, can, wash, out, the, image, there, is, also, a, technique, called, t, ray, imaging, which, is, imaging, using, far, infrared, or, terahertz, radiation, lack, of, bright, sources, can, make, terahertz, photography, more, challenging, than, most, other, infrared, imaging, techniques, recently, t, ray, imaging, has, been, of, considerable, interest, due, to, a, number, of, new, developments, such, as, terahertz, time, domain, spectroscopy, infrared, tracking, also, known, as, infrared, homing, refers, to, a, passive, missile, guidance, system, which, uses, the, emission, from, a, target, of, electromagnetic, radiation, in, the, infrared, part, of, the, spectrum, to, track, it, missiles, that, use, infrared, seeking, are, often, referred, to, as, heat, seekers, since, infrared, ir, is, just, below, the, visible, spectrum, of, light, in, frequency, and, is, radiated, strongly, by, hot, bodies, many, objects, such, as, people, vehicle, engines, and, aircraft, generate, and, retain, heat, and, as, such, are, especially, visible, in, the, infrared, wavelengths, of, light, compared, to, objects, in, the, background, infrared, radiation, can, be, used, as, a, deliberate, heating, source, for, example, it, is, used, in, infrared, saunas, to, heat, the, occupants, it, may, also, be, used, in, other, heating, applications, such, as, to, remove, ice, from, the, wings, of, aircraft, de, icing, infrared, radiation, is, used, in, cooking, known, as, broiling, or, grilling, one, energy, advantage, is, that, the, ir, energy, heats, only, opaque, objects, such, as, food, rather, than, the, air, around, them, infrared, heating, is, also, becoming, more, popular, in, industrial, manufacturing, processes, e, g, curing, of, coatings, forming, of, plastics, annealing, plastic, welding, and, print, drying, in, these, applications, infrared, heaters, replace, convection, ovens, and, contact, heating, a, variety, of, technologies, or, proposed, technologies, take, advantage, of, infrared, emissions, to, cool, buildings, or, other, systems, the, lwir, 8, 15, m, region, is, especially, useful, since, some, radiation, at, these, wavelengths, can, escape, into, space, through, the, atmosphere, s, infrared, window, this, is, how, passive, daytime, radiative, cooling, pdrc, surfaces, are, able, to, achieve, sub, ambient, cooling, temperatures, under, direct, solar, intensity, enhancing, terrestrial, heat, flow, to, outer, space, with, zero, energy, consumption, or, pollution, pdrc, surfaces, maximize, shortwave, solar, reflectance, to, lessen, heat, gain, while, maintaining, strong, longwave, infrared, lwir, thermal, radiation, heat, transfer, when, imagined, on, a, worldwide, scale, this, cooling, method, has, been, proposed, as, a, way, to, slow, and, even, reverse, global, warming, with, some, estimates, proposing, a, global, surface, area, coverage, of, 1, 2, to, balance, global, heat, fluxes, ir, data, transmission, is, also, employed, in, short, range, communication, among, computer, peripherals, and, personal, digital, assistants, these, devices, usually, conform, to, standards, published, by, irda, the, infrared, data, association, remote, controls, and, irda, devices, use, infrared, light, emitting, diodes, leds, to, emit, infrared, radiation, that, may, be, concentrated, by, a, lens, into, a, beam, that, the, user, aims, at, the, detector, the, beam, is, modulated, i, e, switched, on, and, off, according, to, a, code, which, the, receiver, interprets, usually, very, near, ir, is, used, below, 800, nm, for, practical, reasons, this, wavelength, is, efficiently, detected, by, inexpensive, silicon, photodiodes, which, the, receiver, uses, to, convert, the, detected, radiation, to, an, electric, current, that, electrical, signal, is, passed, through, a, high, pass, filter, which, retains, the, rapid, pulsations, due, to, the, ir, transmitter, but, filters, out, slowly, changing, infrared, radiation, from, ambient, light, infrared, communications, are, useful, for, indoor, use, in, areas, of, high, population, density, ir, does, not, penetrate, walls, and, so, does, not, interfere, with, other, devices, in, adjoining, rooms, infrared, is, the, most, common, way, for, remote, controls, to, command, appliances, infrared, remote, control, protocols, like, rc, 5, sirc, are, used, to, communicate, with, infrared, free, space, optical, communication, using, infrared, lasers, can, be, a, relatively, inexpensive, way, to, install, a, communications, link, in, an, urban, area, operating, at, up, to, 4, gigabit, s, compared, to, the, cost, of, burying, fiber, optic, cable, except, for, the, radiation, damage, since, the, eye, cannot, detect, ir, blinking, or, closing, the, eyes, to, help, prevent, or, reduce, damage, may, not, happen, infrared, lasers, are, used, to, provide, the, light, for, optical, fiber, communications, systems, infrared, light, with, a, wavelength, around, 1, 330, nm, least, dispersion, or, 1, 550, nm, best, transmission, are, the, best, choices, for, standard, silica, fibers, ir, data, transmission, of, encoded, audio, versions, of, printed, signs, is, being, researched, as, an, aid, for, visually, impaired, people, through, the, rias, remote, infrared, audible, signage, project, transmitting, ir, data, from, one, device, to, another, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, beaming, infrared, vibrational, spectroscopy, see, also, near, infrared, spectroscopy, is, a, technique, that, can, be, used, to, identify, molecules, by, analysis, of, their, constituent, bonds, each, chemical, bond, in, a, molecule, vibrates, at, a, frequency, characteristic, of, that, bond, a, group, of, atoms, in, a, molecule, e, g, ch, 2, may, have, multiple, modes, of, oscillation, caused, by, the, stretching, and, bending, motions, of, the, group, as, a, whole, if, an, oscillation, leads, to, a, change, in, dipole, in, the, molecule, then, it, will, absorb, a, photon, that, has, the, same, frequency, the, vibrational, frequencies, of, most, molecules, correspond, to, the, frequencies, of, infrared, light, typically, the, technique, is, used, to, study, organic, compounds, using, light, radiation, from, the, mid, infrared, 4, 000, 400, cm, 1, a, spectrum, of, all, the, frequencies, of, absorption, in, a, sample, is, recorded, this, can, be, used, to, gain, information, about, the, sample, composition, in, terms, of, chemical, groups, present, and, also, its, purity, for, example, a, wet, sample, will, show, a, broad, o, h, absorption, around, 3200, cm, 1, the, unit, for, expressing, radiation, in, this, application, cm, 1, is, the, spectroscopic, wavenumber, it, is, the, frequency, divided, by, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, in, the, semiconductor, industry, infrared, light, can, be, used, to, characterize, materials, such, as, thin, films, and, periodic, trench, structures, by, measuring, the, reflectance, of, light, from, the, surface, of, a, semiconductor, wafer, the, index, of, refraction, n, and, the, extinction, coefficient, k, can, be, determined, via, the, forouhi, bloomer, dispersion, equations, the, reflectance, from, the, infrared, light, can, also, be, used, to, determine, the, critical, dimension, depth, and, sidewall, angle, of, high, aspect, ratio, trench, structures, weather, satellites, equipped, with, scanning, radiometers, produce, thermal, or, infrared, images, which, can, then, enable, a, trained, analyst, to, determine, cloud, heights, and, types, to, calculate, land, and, surface, water, temperatures, and, to, locate, ocean, surface, features, the, scanning, is, typically, in, the, range, 10, 3, 12, 5, m, ir4, and, ir5, channels, clouds, with, high, and, cold, tops, such, as, cyclones, or, cumulonimbus, clouds, are, often, displayed, as, red, or, black, lower, warmer, clouds, such, as, stratus, or, stratocumulus, are, displayed, as, blue, or, grey, with, intermediate, clouds, shaded, accordingly, hot, land, surfaces, are, shown, as, dark, grey, or, black, one, disadvantage, of, infrared, imagery, is, that, low, cloud, such, as, stratus, or, fog, can, have, a, temperature, similar, to, the, surrounding, land, or, sea, surface, and, does, not, show, up, however, using, the, difference, in, brightness, of, the, ir4, channel, 10, 3, 11, 5, m, and, the, near, infrared, channel, 1, 58, 1, 64, m, low, cloud, can, be, distinguished, producing, a, fog, satellite, picture, the, main, advantage, of, infrared, is, that, images, can, be, produced, at, night, allowing, a, continuous, sequence, of, weather, to, be, studied, these, infrared, pictures, can, depict, ocean, eddies, or, vortices, and, map, currents, such, as, the, gulf, stream, which, are, valuable, to, the, shipping, industry, fishermen, and, farmers, are, interested, in, knowing, land, and, water, temperatures, to, protect, their, crops, against, frost, or, increase, their, catch, from, the, sea, even, el, ni, o, phenomena, can, be, spotted, using, color, digitized, techniques, the, gray, shaded, thermal, images, can, be, converted, to, color, for, easier, identification, of, desired, information, the, main, water, vapour, channel, at, 6, 40, to, 7, 08, m, can, be, imaged, by, some, weather, satellites, and, shows, the, amount, of, moisture, in, the, atmosphere, in, the, field, of, climatology, atmospheric, infrared, radiation, is, monitored, to, detect, trends, in, the, energy, exchange, between, the, earth, and, the, atmosphere, these, trends, provide, information, on, long, term, changes, in, earth, s, climate, it, is, one, of, the, primary, parameters, studied, in, research, into, global, warming, together, with, solar, radiation, a, pyrgeometer, is, utilized, in, this, field, of, research, to, perform, continuous, outdoor, measurements, this, is, a, broadband, infrared, radiometer, with, sensitivity, for, infrared, radiation, between, approximately, 4, 5, m, and, 50, m, astronomers, observe, objects, in, the, infrared, portion, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, using, optical, components, including, mirrors, lenses, and, solid, state, digital, detectors, for, this, reason, it, is, classified, as, part, of, optical, astronomy, to, form, an, image, the, components, of, an, infrared, telescope, need, to, be, carefully, shielded, from, heat, sources, and, the, detectors, are, chilled, using, liquid, helium, the, sensitivity, of, earth, based, infrared, telescopes, is, significantly, limited, by, water, vapor, in, the, atmosphere, which, absorbs, a, portion, of, the, infrared, radiation, arriving, from, space, outside, of, selected, atmospheric, windows, this, limitation, can, be, partially, alleviated, by, placing, the, telescope, observatory, at, a, high, altitude, or, by, carrying, the, telescope, aloft, with, a, balloon, or, an, aircraft, space, telescopes, do, not, suffer, from, this, handicap, and, so, outer, space, is, considered, the, ideal, location, for, infrared, astronomy, the, infrared, portion, of, the, spectrum, has, several, useful, benefits, for, astronomers, cold, dark, molecular, clouds, of, gas, and, dust, in, our, galaxy, will, glow, with, radiated, heat, as, they, are, irradiated, by, imbedded, stars, infrared, can, also, be, used, to, detect, protostars, before, they, begin, to, emit, visible, light, stars, emit, a, smaller, portion, of, their, energy, in, the, infrared, spectrum, so, nearby, cool, objects, such, as, planets, can, be, more, readily, detected, in, the, visible, light, spectrum, the, glare, from, the, star, will, drown, out, the, reflected, light, from, a, planet, infrared, light, is, also, useful, for, observing, the, cores, of, active, galaxies, which, are, often, cloaked, in, gas, and, dust, distant, galaxies, with, a, high, redshift, will, have, the, peak, portion, of, their, spectrum, shifted, toward, longer, wavelengths, so, they, are, more, readily, observed, in, the, infrared, infrared, cleaning, is, a, technique, used, by, some, motion, picture, film, scanners, film, scanners, and, flatbed, scanners, to, reduce, or, remove, the, effect, of, dust, and, scratches, upon, the, finished, scan, it, works, by, collecting, an, additional, infrared, channel, from, the, scan, at, the, same, position, and, resolution, as, the, three, visible, color, channels, red, green, and, blue, the, infrared, channel, in, combination, with, the, other, channels, is, used, to, detect, the, location, of, scratches, and, dust, once, located, those, defects, can, be, corrected, by, scaling, or, replaced, by, inpainting, infrared, reflectography, can, be, applied, to, paintings, to, reveal, underlying, layers, in, a, non, destructive, manner, in, particular, the, artist, s, underdrawing, or, outline, drawn, as, a, guide, art, conservators, use, the, technique, to, examine, how, the, visible, layers, of, paint, differ, from, the, underdrawing, or, layers, in, between, such, alterations, are, called, pentimenti, when, made, by, the, original, artist, this, is, very, useful, information, in, deciding, whether, a, painting, is, the, prime, version, by, the, original, artist, or, a, copy, and, whether, it, has, been, altered, by, over, enthusiastic, restoration, work, in, general, the, more, pentimenti, the, more, likely, a, painting, is, to, be, the, prime, version, it, also, gives, useful, insights, into, working, practices, reflectography, often, reveals, the, artist, s, use, of, carbon, black, which, shows, up, well, in, reflectograms, as, long, as, it, has, not, also, been, used, in, the, ground, underlying, the, whole, painting, recent, progress, in, the, design, of, infrared, sensitive, cameras, makes, it, possible, to, discover, and, depict, not, only, underpaintings, and, pentimenti, but, entire, paintings, that, were, later, overpainted, by, the, artist, notable, examples, are, picasso, s, woman, ironing, and, blue, room, where, in, both, cases, a, portrait, of, a, man, has, been, made, visible, under, the, painting, as, it, is, known, today, similar, uses, of, infrared, are, made, by, conservators, and, scientists, on, various, types, of, objects, especially, very, old, written, documents, such, as, the, dead, sea, scrolls, the, roman, works, in, the, villa, of, the, papyri, and, the, silk, road, texts, found, in, the, dunhuang, caves, carbon, black, used, in, ink, can, show, up, extremely, well, the, pit, viper, has, a, pair, of, infrared, sensory, pits, on, its, head, there, is, uncertainty, regarding, the, exact, thermal, sensitivity, of, this, biological, infrared,

aristolochiae, and, troides, rhadamantus, plateni, shield, them, from, heat, damage, as, they, sunbathe, in, the, sun, additionally, it, s, hypothesised, that, thermoreceptors, let, bloodsucking, bugs, triatoma, infestans, locate, their, warm, blooded, victims, by, sensing, their, body, heat, some, fungi, like, venturia, inaequalis, require, near, infrared, light, for, ejection, although, near, infrared, vision, 780, 1, 000, nm, has, long, been, deemed, impossible, due, to, noise, in, visual, pigments, sensation, of, near, infrared, light, was, reported, in, the, common, carp, and, in, three, cichlid, species, fish, use, nir, to, capture, prey, and, for, phototactic, swimming, orientation, nir, sensation, in, fish, may, be, relevant, under, poor, lighting, conditions, during,

possible, mechanisms, strong, infrared, radiation, in, certain, industry, high, heat, settings, may, be, hazardous, to, the, eyes, resulting, in, damage, or, blindness, to, the, user, since, the, radiation, is, invisible, special, ir, proof, goggles, must, be, worn, in, such, places, the, discovery, of, infrared, radiation, is, ascribed, to, william, herschel, the, astronomer, in, the, early, 19th, century, herschel, published, his, results, in, 1800, before, the, royal, society, of, london, herschel, used, a, prism, to, refract, light, from, the, sun, and, detected, the, infrared, beyond, the, red, part, of, the, spectrum, through, an, increase, in, the, temperature, recorded, on, a, thermometer, he, was, surprised, at, the, result, and, called, them, calorific, rays, the, term, infrared, did, not, appear, until, late, 19th, century, an, earlier, experiment, in, 1790, by, marc, auguste, pictet, demonstrated, the, reflection, and, focusing, of, radiant, heat, via, mirrors, in,
