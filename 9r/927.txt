a, magnetic, field, sometimes, called, b, field, is, a, physical, field, that, describes, the, magnetic, influence, on, moving, electric, charges, electric, currents, ch1, and, magnetic, materials, a, moving, charge, in, a, magnetic, field, experiences, a, force, perpendicular, to, its, own, velocity, and, to, the, magnetic, field, ch13, 278, a, permanent, magnet, s, magnetic, field, pulls, on, ferromagnetic, materials, such, as, iron, and, attracts, or, repels, other, magnets, in, addition, a, nonuniform, magnetic, field, exerts, minuscule, forces, on, nonmagnetic, materials, by, three, other, magnetic, effects, paramagnetism, diamagnetism, and, antiferromagnetism, although, these, forces, are, usually, so, small, they, can, only, be, detected, by, laboratory, equipment, magnetic, fields, surround, magnetized, materials, electric, currents, and, electric, fields, varying, in, time, since, both, strength, and, direction, of, a, magnetic, field, may, vary, with, location, it, is, described, mathematically, by, a, function, assigning, a, vector, to, each, point, of, space, called, a, vector, field, more, precisely, a, pseudovector, field, in, electromagnetics, the, term, magnetic, field, is, used, for, two, distinct, but, closely, related, vector, fields, denoted, by, the, symbols, b, and, h, in, the, international, system, of, units, the, unit, of, b, magnetic, flux, density, is, the, tesla, in, si, base, units, kilogram, per, second, 2, per, ampere, 21, which, is, equivalent, to, newton, per, meter, per, ampere, the, unit, of, h, magnetic, field, strength, is, ampere, per, meter, a, m, 22, b, and, h, differ, in, how, they, take, the, medium, and, or, magnetization, into, account, in, vacuum, the, two, fields, are, related, through, the, vacuum,

material, magnetic, fields, are, produced, by, moving, electric, charges, and, the, intrinsic, magnetic, moments, of, elementary, particles, associated, with, a, fundamental, quantum, property, their, spin, ch1, magnetic, fields, and, electric, fields, are, interrelated, and, are, both, components, of, the, electromagnetic, force, one, of, the, four, fundamental, forces, of, nature, magnetic, fields, are, used, throughout, modern, technology, particularly, in, electrical, engineering, and, electromechanics, rotating, magnetic, fields, are, used, in, both, electric, motors, and, generators, the, interaction, of, magnetic, fields, in, electric, devices, such, as, transformers, is, conceptualized, and, investigated, as, magnetic, circuits, magnetic, forces, give, information, about, the, charge, carriers, in, a, material, through, the, hall, effect, the, earth, produces, its, own, magnetic, field, which, shields, the, earth, s, ozone, layer, from, the, solar, wind, and, is, important, in, navigation, using, a, compass, the, force, on, an, electric, charge, depends, on, its, location, speed, and, direction, two, vector, fields, are, used, to, describe, this, force, ch1, the, first, is, the, electric, field, which, describes, the, force, acting, on, a, stationary, charge, and, gives, the, component, of, the, force, that, is, independent, of, motion, the, magnetic, field, in, contrast, describes, the, component, of, the, force, that, is, proportional, to, both, the, speed, and, direction, of, charged, particles, ch13, the, field, is, defined, by, the, lorentz, force, law, and, is, at, each, instant, perpendicular, to, both, the, motion, of, the, charge, and, the, force, it, experiences, there, are, two, different, but, closely, related, vector, fields, which, are, both, sometimes, called, the, magnetic, field, written, b, and, h, while, both, the, best, names, for, these, fields, and, exact, interpretation, of, what, these, fields, represent, has, been, the, subject, of, long, running, debate, there, is, wide, agreement, about, how, the, underlying, physics, work, historically, the, term, magnetic, field, was, reserved, for, h, while, using, other, terms, for, b, but, many, recent, textbooks, use, the, term, magnetic, field, to, describe, b, as, well, as, or, in, place, of, h, there, are, many, alternative, names, for, both, see, sidebars, the, magnetic, field, vector, b, at, any, point, can, be, defined, as, the, vector, that, when, used, in, the, lorentz, force, law, correctly, predicts, the, force, on, a, charged, particle, at, that,

the, right, hand, pointing, the, thumb, in, the, direction, of, the, current, and, the, fingers, in, the, direction, of, the, magnetic, field, the, resulting, force, on, the, charge, points, outwards, from, the, palm, the, force, on, a, negatively, charged, particle, is, in, the, opposite, direction, if, both, the, speed, and, the, charge, are, reversed, then, the, direction, of, the, force, remains, the, same, for, that, reason, a, magnetic, field, measurement, by, itself, cannot, distinguish, whether, there, is, a, positive, charge, moving, to, the, right, or, a, negative, charge, moving, to, the, left, both, of, these, cases, produce, the, same, current, on, the, other, hand, a, magnetic, field, combined, with, an, electric, field, can, distinguish, between, these, see, hall,

to, measure, the, local, magnetic, field, is, known, as, a, magnetometer, important, classes, of, magnetometers, include, using, induction, magnetometers, or, search, coil, magnetometers, which, measure, only, varying, magnetic, fields, rotating, coil, magnetometers, hall, effect, magnetometers, nmr, magnetometers, squid, magnetometers, and, fluxgate, magnetometers, the, magnetic, fields, of, distant, astronomical, objects, are, measured, through, their, effects, on, local, charged, particles, for, instance, electrons, spiraling, around, a, field, line, produce, synchrotron, radiation, that, is, detectable, in, radio, waves, the, finest, precision, for, a, magnetic, field, measurement, was, attained, by, gravity, probe, b, at, 5, at, 5, 10, 18, t, the, field, can, be, visualized, by, a, set, of, magnetic, field, lines, that, follow, the, direction, of, the, field, at, each, point, the, lines, can, be, constructed, by, measuring, the, strength, and, direction, of, the, magnetic, field, at, a, large, number, of, points, or, at, every, point, in, space, then, mark, each, location, with, an, arrow, called, a, vector, pointing, in, the, direction, of, the, local, magnetic, field, with, its, magnitude, proportional, to, the, strength, of, the, magnetic, field, connecting, these, arrows, then, forms, a, set, of, magnetic, field, lines, the, direction, of, the, magnetic, field, at, any, point, is, parallel, to, the, direction, of, nearby, field, lines, and, the, local, density, of, field, lines, can, be, made, proportional, to, its, strength, magnetic, field, lines, are, like, streamlines, in, fluid, flow, in, that, they, represent, a, continuous, distribution, and, a, different, resolution, would, show, more, or, fewer, lines, an, advantage, of, using, magnetic, field, lines, as, a, representation, is, that, many, laws, of, magnetism, and, electromagnetism, can, be, stated, completely, and, concisely, using, simple, concepts, such, as, the, number, of, field, lines, through, a, surface, these, concepts, can, be, quickly, translated, to, their, mathematical, form, for, example, the, number, of, field, lines, through, a, given, surface, is, the, surface, integral, of, the, magnetic, field, 237, various, phenomena, display, magnetic, field, lines, as, though, the, field, lines, were, physical, phenomena, for, example, iron, filings, placed, in, a, magnetic, field, form, lines, that, correspond, to, field, lines, magnetic, field, lines, are, also, visually, displayed, in, polar, auroras, in, which, plasma, particle, dipole, interactions, create, visible, streaks, of, light, that, line, up, with, the, local, direction, of, earth, s, magnetic, field, field, lines, can, be, used, as, a, qualitative, tool, to, visualize, magnetic, forces, in, ferromagnetic, substances, like, iron, and, in, plasmas, magnetic, forces, can, be, understood, by, imagining, that, the, field, lines, exert, a, tension, like, a, rubber, band, along, their, length, and, a, pressure, perpendicular, to, their, length, on, neighboring, field, lines, unlike, poles, of, magnets, attract, because, they, are, linked, by, many, field, lines, like, poles, repel, because, their, field, lines, do, not, meet, but, run, parallel, pushing, on, each, other, permanent, magnets, are, objects, that, produce, their, own, persistent, magnetic, fields, they, are, made, of, ferromagnetic, materials, such, as, iron, and, nickel, that, have, been, magnetized, and, they, have, both, a, north, and, a, south, pole, the, magnetic, field, of, permanent, magnets, can, be, quite, complicated, especially, near, the, magnet, the, magnetic, field, of, a, small, straight, magnet, is, proportional, to, the, magnet, s, strength, called, its, magnetic, dipole, moment, m, the, equations, are, non, trivial, and, depend, on, the, distance, from, the, magnet, and, the, orientation, of, the, magnet, for, simple, magnets, m, points, in, the, direction, of, a, line, drawn, from, the, south, to, the, north, pole, of, the, magnet, flipping, a, bar, magnet, is, equivalent, to, rotating, its, m, by, 180, degrees, the, magnetic, field, of, larger, magnets, can, be, obtained, by, modeling, them, as, a, collection, of, a, large, number, of, small, magnets, called, dipoles, each, having, their, own, m, the, magnetic, field, produced, by, the, magnet, then, is, the, net, magnetic, field, of, these, dipoles, any, net, force, on, the, magnet, is, a, result, of, adding, up, the, forces, on, the, individual, dipoles, there, are, two, simplified, models, for, the, nature, of, these, dipoles, the, magnetic, pole, model, and, the, amperian, loop, model, these, two, models, produce, two, different, magnetic, fields, h, and, b, outside, a, material, though, the, two, are, identical, to, a, multiplicative, constant, so, that, in, many, cases, the, distinction, can, be, ignored, this, is, particularly, true, for, magnetic, fields, such, as, those, due, to, electric, currents, that, are, not, generated, by, magnetic, materials, a, realistic, model, of, magnetism, is, more, complicated, than, either, of, these, models, neither, model, fully, explains, why, materials, are, magnetic, the, monopole, model, has, no, experimental, support, the, amperian, loop, model, explains, some, but, not, all, of, a, material, s, magnetic, moment, the, model, predicts, that, the, motion, of, electrons, within, an, atom, are, connected, to, those, electrons, orbital, magnetic, dipole, moment, and, these, orbital, moments, do, contribute, to, the, magnetism, seen, at, the, macroscopic, level, however, the, motion, of, electrons, is, not, classical, and, the, spin, magnetic, moment, of, electrons, which, is, not, explained, by, either, model, is, also, a, significant, contribution, to, the, total, moment, of, magnets, historically, early, physics, textbooks, would, model, the, force, and, torques, between, two, magnets, as, due, to, magnetic, poles, repelling, or, attracting, each, other, in, the, same, manner, as, the, coulomb, force, between, electric, charges, at, the, microscopic, level, this, model, contradicts, the, experimental, evidence, and, the, pole, model, of, magnetism, is, no, longer, the, typical, way, to, introduce, the, concept, 258, however, it, is, still, sometimes, used, as, a, macroscopic, model, for, ferromagnetism, due, to, its, mathematical, simplicity, in, this, model, a, magnetic, h, field, is, produced, by, fictitious, magnetic, charges, that, are, spread, over, the, surface, of, each, pole, these, magnetic, charges, are, in, fact, related, to, the, magnetization, field, m, the, h, field, therefore, is, analogous, to, the, electric, field, e, which, starts, at, a, positive, electric, charge, and, ends, at, a, negative, electric, charge, near, the, north, pole, therefore, all, h, field, lines, point, away, from, the, north, pole, whether, inside, the, magnet, or, out, while, near, the, south, pole, all, h, field, lines, point, toward, the, south, pole, whether, inside, the, magnet, or, out, too, a, north, pole, feels, a, force, in, the, direction, of, the, h, field, while, the, force, on, the, south, pole, is, opposite, to, the, h, field, in, the, magnetic, pole, model, the, elementary, magnetic, dipole, m, is, formed, by, two, opposite, magnetic, poles, of, pole, strength, q, m, separated, by, a, small, distance, vector, d, such, that, m, q, m, d, the, magnetic, pole, model, predicts, correctly, the, field, h, both, inside, and, outside, magnetic, materials, in, particular, the, fact, that, h, is, opposite, to, the, magnetization, field, m, inside, a, permanent, magnet, since, it, is, based, on, the, fictitious, idea, of, a, magnetic, charge, density, the, pole, model, has, limitations, magnetic, poles, cannot, exist, apart, from, each, other, as, electric, charges, can, but, always, come, in, north, south, pairs, if, a, magnetized, object, is, divided, in, half, a, new, pole, appears, on, the, surface, of, each, piece, so, each, has, a, pair, of, complementary, poles, the, magnetic, pole, model, does, not, account, for, magnetism, that, is, produced, by, electric, currents, nor, the, inherent, connection, between, angular, momentum, and, magnetism, the, pole, model, usually, treats, magnetic, charge, as, a, mathematical, abstraction, rather, than, a, physical, property, of, particles, however, a, magnetic, monopole, is, a, hypothetical, particle, or, class, of, particles, that, physically, has, only, one, magnetic, pole, either, a, north, pole, or, a, south, pole, in, other, words, it, would, possess, a, magnetic, charge, analogous, to, an, electric, charge, magnetic, field, lines, would, start, or, end, on, magnetic, monopoles, so, if, they, exist, they, would, give, exceptions, to, the, rule, that, magnetic, field, lines, neither, start, nor, end, some, theories, such, as, grand, unified, theories, have, predicted, the, existence, of, magnetic, monopoles, but, so, far, none, have, been, observed, in, the, model, developed, by, ampere, the, elementary, magnetic, dipole, that, makes, up, all, magnets, is, a, sufficiently, small, amperian, loop, with, current, i, and, loop, area, a, the, dipole, moment, of, this, loop, is, m, ia, these, magnetic, dipoles, produce, a, magnetic, b, field, the, magnetic, field, of, a, magnetic, dipole, is, depicted, in, the, figure, from, outside, the, ideal, magnetic, dipole, is, identical, to, that, of, an, ideal, electric, dipole, of, the, same, strength, unlike, the, electric, dipole, a, magnetic, dipole, is, properly, modeled, as, a, current, loop, having, a, current, i, and, an, area, a, such, a, current, loop, has, a, magnetic, moment, of, m, i, a, displaystyle, m, ia, where, the, direction, of, m, is, perpendicular, to, the, area, of, the, loop, and, depends, on, the, direction, of, the, current, using, the, right, hand, rule, an, ideal, magnetic, dipole, is, modeled, as, a, real, magnetic, dipole, whose, area, a, has, been, reduced, to, zero, and, its, current, i, increased, to, infinity, such, that, the, product, m, ia, is, finite, this, model, clarifies, the, connection, between, angular, momentum, and, magnetic, moment, which, is, the, basis, of, the, einstein, de, haas, effect, rotation, by, magnetization, and, its, inverse, the, barnett, effect, or, magnetization, by, rotation, rotating, the, loop, faster, in, the, same, direction, increases, the, current, and, therefore, the, magnetic, moment, for, example, specifying, the, force, between, two, small, magnets, is, quite, complicated, because, it, depends, on, the, strength, and, orientation, of, both, magnets, and, their, distance, and, direction, relative, to, each, other, the, force, is, particularly, sensitive, to, rotations, of, the, magnets, due, to, magnetic, torque, the, force, on, each, magnet, depends, on, its, magnetic, moment, and, the, magnetic, field, of, the, other, to, understand, the, force, between, magnets, it, is, useful, to, examine, the, magnetic, pole, model, given, above, in, this, model, the, h, field, of, one, magnet, pushes, and, pulls, on, both, poles, of, a, second, magnet, if, this, h, field, is, the, same, at, both, poles, of, the, second, magnet, then, there, is, no, net, force, on, that, magnet, since, the, force, is, opposite, for, opposite, poles, if, however, the, magnetic, field, of, the, first, magnet, is, nonuniform, such, as, the, h, near, one, of, its, poles, each, pole, of, the, second, magnet, sees, a, different, field, and, is, subject, to, a, different, force, this, difference, in, the, two, forces, moves, the, magnet, in, the, direction, of, increasing, magnetic, field, and, may, also, cause, a, net, torque, this, is, a, specific, example, of, a, general, rule, that, magnets, are, attracted, or, repulsed, depending, on, the, orientation, of, the, magnet, into, regions, of, higher, magnetic, field, any, non, uniform, magnetic, field, whether, caused, by, permanent, magnets, or, electric, currents, exerts, a, force, on, a, small, magnet, in, this, way, the, details, of, the, amperian, loop, model, are, different, and, more, complicated, but, yield, the, same, result, that, magnetic, dipoles, are, attracted, repelled, into, regions, of, higher, magnetic, field, mathematically, the, force, on, a, small, magnet, having, a, magnetic, moment, m, due, to, a, magnetic, field, b, is, eq, 11, 42, f, m, b, displaystyle, mathbf, f, boldsymbol, nabla, left, mathbf, m, cdot, mathbf, b, right, where, the, gradient, is, the, change, of, the, quantity, m, b, per, unit, distance, and, the, direction, is, that, of, maximum, increase, of, m, b, the, dot, product, m, b, mb, cos, where, m, and, b, represent, the, magnitude, of, the, m, and, b, vectors, and, is, the, angle, between, them, if, m, is, in, the, same, direction, as, b, then, the, dot, product, is, positive, and, the, gradient, points, uphill, pulling, the, magnet, into, regions, of, higher, b, field, more, strictly, larger, m, b, this, equation, is, strictly, only, valid, for, magnets, of, zero, size, but, is, often, a, good, approximation, for, not, too, large, magnets, the, magnetic, force, on, larger, magnets, is, determined, by, dividing, them, into, smaller, regions, each, having, their, own, m, then, summing, up, the, forces, on, each, of, these, very, small, regions, if, two, like, poles, of, two, separate, magnets, are, brought, near, each, other, and, one, of, the, magnets, is, allowed, to, turn, it, promptly, rotates, to, align, itself, with, the, first, in, this, example, the, magnetic, field, of, the, stationary, magnet, creates, a, magnetic, torque, on, the, magnet, that, is, free, to, rotate, this, magnetic, torque, tends, to, align, a, magnet, s, poles, with, the, magnetic, field, lines, a, compass, therefore, turns, to, align, itself, with, earth, s, magnetic, field, in, terms, of, the, pole, model, two, equal, and, opposite, magnetic, charges, experiencing, the, same, h, also, experience, equal, and, opposite, forces, since, these, equal, and, opposite, forces, are, in, different, locations, this, produces, a, torque, proportional, to, the, distance, perpendicular, to, the, force, between, them, with, the, definition, of, m, as, the, pole, strength, times, the, distance, between, the, poles, this, leads, to, 0, m, h, sin, where, 0, is, a, constant, called, the, vacuum, permeability, measuring, 4, 10, 7, v, s, a, m, and, is, the, angle, between, h, and, m, mathematically, the, torque, on, a, small, magnet, is, proportional, both, to, the, applied, magnetic, field, and, to, the, magnetic, moment, m, of, the, magnet, m, b, 0, m, h,

in, the, same, direction, further, all, other, orientations, feel, a, torque, that, twists, them, toward, the, direction, of, magnetic, field, currents, of, electric, charges, both, generate, a,

well, known, magnetic, fields, that, depend, on, the, charge, velocity, and, acceleration, of, the, particles, magnetic, field, lines, form, in, concentric, circles, around, a, cylindrical, current, carrying, conductor, such, as, a, length, of, wire, the, direction, of, such, a, magnetic, field, can, be, determined, by, using, the, right, hand, grip, rule, see, figure, at, right, the, strength, of, the, magnetic, field, decreases, with, distance, from, the, wire, for, an, infinite, length, wire, the, strength, is, inversely, proportional, to, the, distance, bending, a, current, carrying, wire, into, a, loop, concentrates, the, magnetic, field, inside, the, loop, while, weakening, it, outside, bending, a, wire, into, multiple, closely, spaced, loops, to, form, a, coil, or, solenoid,

i, displaystyle, mathbf, b, frac, mu, 0, 2, pi, r, i, where, r, r, the, direction, is, tangent, to, a, circle, perpendicular, to, the, wire, according, to, the, right, hand, rule, 225, a, slightly, more, general, way, of, relating, the, current, i, displaystyle, i, to, the, b, field, is, through, amp, re, s, law, b, d, 0, i, e, n, c, displaystyle, oint, mathbf, b, cdot, mathrm, d, boldsymbol,

always, valid, for, steady, currents, and, can, be, used, to, calculate, the, b, field, for, certain, highly, symmetric, situations, such, as, an, infinite, wire, or, an, infinite, solenoid, in, a, modified, form, that, accounts, for, time, varying, electric, fields, amp, re, s, law, is, one, of, four, maxwell, s, equations, that, describe, electricity, and, magnetism, a, charged, particle, moving, in, a, b, field, experiences, a, sideways, force, that, is, proportional, to, the, strength, of, the, magnetic, field, the, component, of, the, velocity, that, is, perpendicular, to, the, magnetic, field, and, the, charge, of, the, particle, this, force, is, known, as, the, lorentz, force, and, is, given, by, f, q, e, q, v, b, displaystyle, mathbf, f, q, mathbf, e, q, mathbf, v, times, mathbf, b, where, f, is, the, force, q, is, the, electric, charge, of, the, particle, v, is, the, instantaneous, velocity, of, the, particle, and, b, is, the, magnetic, field, in, teslas, the, lorentz, force, is, always, perpendicular, to, both, the, velocity, of, the, particle, and, the, magnetic, field, that, created, it, when, a, charged, particle, moves, in, a, static, magnetic, field, it, traces, a, helical, path, in, which, the, helix, axis, is, parallel, to, the, magnetic, field, and, in, which, the, speed, of, the, particle, remains, constant, because, the, magnetic, force, is, always, perpendicular, to, the, motion, the, magnetic, field, can, do, no, work, on, an, isolated, charge, it, can, only, do, work, indirectly, via, the, electric, field, generated, by, a, changing, magnetic, field, it, is, often, claimed, that, the, magnetic, force, can, do, work, to, a, non, elementary, magnetic, dipole, or, to, charged, particles, whose, motion, is, constrained, by, other, forces, but, this, is, incorrect, because, the, work, in, those, cases, is, performed, by, the, electric, forces, of, the, charges, deflected, by, the, magnetic, field, the, force, on, a, current, carrying, wire, is, similar, to, that, of, a, moving, charge, as, expected, since, a, current, carrying, wire, is, a, collection, of, moving, charges, a, current, carrying, wire, feels, a, force, in, the, presence, of, a, magnetic, field, the, lorentz, force, on, a, macroscopic, current, is, often, referred, to, as, the, laplace, force, consider, a, conductor, of, length, cross, section, a, and, charge, q, due, to, electric, current, i, if, this, conductor, is, placed, in, a, magnetic, field, of, magnitude, b, that, makes, an, angle, with, the, velocity, of, charges, in, the, conductor, the, force, exerted, on, a, single, charge, q, is, f, q, v, b, sin, displaystyle, f, qvb, sin, theta, so, for, n, charges, where, n, n, a, displaystyle, n, n, ell, a, the, force, exerted, on, the,

are, correct, when, dealing, with, the, entire, current, a, magnetic, material, placed, inside, a, magnetic, field, though, generates, its, own, bound, current, which, can, be, a, challenge, to, calculate, this, bound, current, is, due, to, the, sum, of, atomic, sized, current, loops, and, the, spin, of, the, subatomic, particles, such, as, electrons, that, make, up, the, material, the, h, field, as, defined, above, helps, factor, out, this, bound, current, but, to, see, how, it, helps, to, introduce, the, concept, of, magnetization, first, the, magnetization, vector, field, m, represents, how, strongly, a, region, of, material, is, magnetized, it, is, defined, as, the, net, magnetic, dipole, moment, per, unit, volume, of, that, region, the, magnetization, of, a, uniform, magnet, is, therefore, a, material, constant, equal, to, the, magnetic, moment, m, of, the, magnet, divided, by, its, volume, since, the, si, unit, of, magnetic, moment, is, a, m, 2, the, si, unit, of, magnetization, m, is, ampere, per, meter, identical, to, that, of, the, h, field, the, magnetization, m, field, of, a, region, points, in, the, direction, of, the, average, magnetic, dipole, moment, in, that, region, magnetization, field, lines, therefore, begin, near, the, magnetic, south, pole, and, ends, near, the, magnetic, north, pole, magnetization, does, not, exist, outside, the, magnet, in, the, amperian, loop, model, the, magnetization, is, due, to, combining, many, tiny, amperian, loops, to, form, a, resultant, current, called, bound, current, this, bound, current, then, is, the, source, of, the, magnetic, b, field, due, to, the, magnet, given, the, definition, of, the, magnetic, dipole, the, magnetization, field, follows, a, similar, law, to, that, of, ampere, s, law, m, d, i, b, displaystyle, oint, mathbf, m, cdot, mathrm, d, boldsymbol, ell, i, mathrm, b, where, the, integral, is, a, line, integral, over, any, closed, loop, and, i, b, is, the, bound, current, enclosed, by, that, closed, loop, in, the, magnetic, pole, model, magnetization, begins, at, and, ends, at, magnetic, poles, if, a, given, region, therefore, has, a, net, positive, magnetic, pole, strength, corresponding, to, a, north, pole, then, it, has, more, magnetization, field, lines, entering, it, than, leaving, it, mathematically, this, is, equivalent, to, s, 0, m, d, a, q, m, displaystyle, oint, s, mu, 0, mathbf, m, cdot, mathrm, d, mathbf, a, q, mathrm, m, where, the, integral, is, a, closed, surface, integral, over, the, closed, surface, s, and, q, m, is, the, magnetic,

the, magnetization, field, moves, from, south, to, north, in, si, units, the, h, field, is, related, to, the, b, field, by, h, b, 0, m, displaystyle, mathbf, h, equiv, frac, mathbf, b, mu, 0, mathbf,

mathbf, m, right, cdot, mathrm, d, boldsymbol, ell, i, mathrm, tot, i, mathrm, b, i, mathrm, f, where, i, f, represents, the, free, current, enclosed, by, the, loop, so, that, the, line, integral, of, h, does, not, depend, at, all, on, the, bound, currents, for, the, differential, equivalent, of, this, equation, see, maxwell, s, equations, ampere, s, law, leads, to, the, boundary, condition, h, 1,

unit, normal, n, displaystyle, hat, mathbf, n, points, in, the, direction, from, medium, 2, to, medium, 1, similarly, a, surface, integral, of, h, over, any, closed, surface, is, independent, of, the, free, currents, and, picks, out, the, magnetic, charges, within, that, closed, surface, s, 0, h, d, a, s, b, 0, m, d, a, 0, q, m, q, m, displaystyle, oint, s, mu, 0, mathbf, h, cdot, mathrm, d,

separated, into, two, independent, parts, h, h, 0, h, d, displaystyle, mathbf, h, mathbf, h, 0, mathbf, h, mathrm, d, where, h, 0, is, the, applied, magnetic, field, due, only, to, the, free, currents, and, h, d, is, the, demagnetizing, field, due, only, to, the, bound, currents, the, magnetic, h, field, therefore, re, factors, the, bound, current, in, terms, of, magnetic, charges, the, h, field, lines, loop, only, around, free, current, and, unlike, the, magnetic, b, field, begins, and, ends, near, magnetic, poles, as, well, most, materials, respond, to, an, applied, b, field, by, producing, their, own, magnetization, m, and, therefore, their, own, b, fields, typically, the, response, is, weak, and, exists, only, when, the, magnetic, field, is, applied, the, term, magnetism, describes, how, materials, respond, on, the, microscopic, level, to, an, applied, magnetic, field, and, is, used, to, categorize, the, magnetic, phase, of, a, material, materials, are, divided, into, groups, based, upon, their, magnetic, behavior, in, the, case, of, paramagnetism, and, diamagnetism, the, magnetization, m, is, often, proportional, to, the, applied, magnetic, field, such, that, b, h, displaystyle, mathbf, b, mu, mathbf, h, where, is, a, material, dependent, parameter, called, the, permeability, in, some, cases, the, permeability, may, be, a, second, rank, tensor, so, that, h, may, not, point, in, the, same, direction, as, b, these, relations, between, b, and, h, are, examples, of, constitutive, equations, however, superconductors, and, ferromagnets, have, a, more, complex, b, to, h, relation, see, magnetic, hysteresis, energy, is, needed, to, generate, a, magnetic, field, both, to, work, against, the, electric, field, that, a, changing, magnetic, field, creates, and, to, change, the, magnetization, of, any, material, within, the, magnetic, field, for, non, dispersive, materials, this, same, energy, is, released, when, the, magnetic, field, is, destroyed, so, that, the, energy, can, be, modeled, as, being, stored, in, the, magnetic, field, for, linear, non, dispersive, materials, such, that, b, h, where, is, frequency, independent, the, energy, density, is, u,

materials, around, then, can, be, replaced, by, 0, the, above, equation, cannot, be, used, for, nonlinear, materials, though, a, more, general, expression, given, below, must, be, used, in, general, the, incremental, amount, of, work, per, unit, volume, w, needed, to, cause, a, small, change, of, magnetic, field, b, is, w, h, b, displaystyle, delta, w, mathbf, h, cdot, delta, mathbf, b, once, the, relationship, between, h, and, b, is, known, this, equation, is, used, to, determine, the, work, needed, to, reach, a, given, magnetic, state, for, hysteretic, materials, such, as, ferromagnets, and, superconductors, the, work, needed, also, depends, on, how, the, magnetic, field, is, created, for, linear, non, dispersive, materials, though, the, general, equation, leads, directly, to, the, simpler, energy, density, equation, given, above, like, all, vector, fields, a, magnetic, field, has, two, important, mathematical, properties, that, relates, it, to, its, sources, for, b, the, sources, are, currents, and, changing, electric, fields, these, two, properties, along, with, the, two, corresponding, properties, of, the, electric, field, make, up, maxwell, s, equations, maxwell, s, equations, together, with, the, lorentz, force, law, form, a, complete, description, of, classical, electrodynamics, including, both, electricity, and, magnetism, the, first, property, is, the, divergence, of, a, vector, field, a, a, which, represents, how, a, flows, outward, from, a, given, point, as, discussed, above, a, b, field, line, never, starts, or, ends, at, a, point, but, instead, forms, a, complete, loop, this, is, mathematically, equivalent, to, saying, that, the, divergence, of, b, is, zero, such, vector, fields, are, called, solenoidal, vector, fields, this, property, is, called, gauss, s, law, for, magnetism, and, is, equivalent, to, the, statement, that, there, are, no, isolated, magnetic, poles, or, magnetic, monopoles, the, second, mathematical, property, is, called, the, curl, such, that, a, represents, how, a, curls, or, circulates, around, a, given, point, the, result, of, the, curl, is, called, a, circulation, source, the, equations, for, the, curl, of, b, and, of, e, are, called, the, amp, re, maxwell, equation, and, faraday, s, law, respectively, one, important, property, of, the, b, field, produced, this, way, is, that, magnetic, b, field, lines, neither, start, nor, end, mathematically, b, is, a, solenoidal, vector, field, a, field, line, may, only, extend, to, infinity, or, wrap, around, to, form, a, closed, curve, or, follow, a, never, ending, possibly, chaotic, path, magnetic, field, lines, exit, a, magnet, near, its, north, pole, and, enter, near, its, south, pole, but, inside, the, magnet, b, field, lines, continue, through, the, magnet, from, the, south, pole, back, to, the, north, if, a, b, field, line, enters, a, magnet, somewhere, it, has, to, leave, somewhere, else, it, is, not, allowed, to, have, an, end, point, more, formally, since, all, the, magnetic, field, lines, that, enter, any, given, region, must, also, leave, that, region, subtracting, the, number, of, field, lines, that, enter, the, region, from, the, number, that, exit, gives, identically, zero, mathematically, this, is, equivalent, to, gauss, s, law, for, magnetism, s, b, d, a, 0, displaystyle, oint, s, mathbf, b, cdot, mathrm, d, mathbf, a, 0, where, the, integral, is, a, surface, integral, over, the, closed, surface, s, a, closed, surface, is, one, that, completely, surrounds, a, region, with, no, holes, to, let, any, field, lines, escape, since, d, a, points, outward, the, dot, product, in, the, integral, is, positive, for, b, field, pointing, out, and, negative, for, b, field, pointing, in, a, changing, magnetic, field, such, as, a, magnet, moving, through, a, conducting, coil, generates, an, electric, field, and, therefore, tends, to, drive, a, current, in, such, a, coil, this, is, known, as, faraday, s, law, and, forms, the, basis, of, many, electrical, generators, and, electric, motors, mathematically, faraday, s, law, is, e, d, d, t, displaystyle, mathcal, e, frac, mathrm, d, phi, mathrm, d, t, where, e, displaystyle, mathcal, e, is, the, electromotive, force, or, emf, the, voltage, generated, around, a, closed, loop, and, is, the, magnetic, flux, the, product, of, the, area, times, the, magnetic, field, normal, to, that, area, this, definition, of, magnetic, flux, is, why, b, is, often, referred, to, as, magnetic, flux, density, 210, the, negative, sign, represents, the, fact, that, any, current, generated, by, a, changing, magnetic, field, in, a, coil, produces, a, magnetic, field, that, opposes, the, change, in, the, magnetic, field, that, induced, it, this, phenomenon, is, known, as, lenz, s, law, this, integral, formulation, of, faraday, s, law, can, be, converted, into, a, differential, form, which, applies, under, slightly, different, conditions, e, b, t, displaystyle, nabla, times, mathbf, e, frac, partial, mathbf, b, partial, t, similar, to, the, way, that, a, changing, magnetic, field, generates, an, electric, field, a, changing, electric, field, generates, a, magnetic, field, this, fact, is, known, as, maxwell, s, correction, to, amp, re, s, law, and, is, applied, as, an, additive, term, to, ampere, s, law, as, given, above, this, additional, term, is, proportional, to, the, time, rate, of, change, of, the, electric, flux, and, is, similar, to, faraday, s, law, above, but, with, a, different, and, positive, constant, out, front, the, electric, flux, through, an, area, is, proportional, to, the, area, times, the, perpendicular, part, of, the, electric, field, the, full, law, including, the, correction, term, is, known, as, the, maxwell, amp, re, equation, it, is, not, commonly, given, in, integral, form, because, the, effect, is, so, small, that, it, can, typically, be, ignored, in, most, cases, where, the, integral, form, is, used, the, maxwell, term, is, critically, important, in, the, creation, and, propagation, of, electromagnetic, waves, maxwell, s, correction, to, amp, re, s, law, together, with, faraday, s, law, of, induction, describes, how, mutually, changing, electric, and, magnetic, fields, interact, to, sustain, each, other, and, thus, to, form, electromagnetic, waves, such, as, light, a, changing, electric, field, generates, a, changing, magnetic, field, which, generates, a, changing, electric, field, again, these, though, are, usually, described, using, the, differential, form, of, this, equation, given,

internal, bound, charge, and, current, distributions, that, contribute, to, e, and, b, but, are, difficult, to, calculate, to, circumvent, this, problem, h, and, d, fields, are, used, to, re, factor, maxwell, s, equations, in, terms, of, the, free, current, density, j, f, h, j, f, d, t, displaystyle, nabla, times, mathbf, h, mathbf, j, mathrm, f, frac, partial, mathbf, d, partial, t, these, equations, are, not, any, more, general, than, the, original, equations, if, the, bound, charges, and, currents, in, the, material, are, known, they, also, must, be, supplemented, by, the, relationship, between, b, and, h, as, well, as, that, between, e, and, d, on, the, other, hand, for, simple, relationships, between, these, quantities, this, form, of, maxwell, s, equations, can, circumvent, the, need, to, calculate, the, bound, charges, and, currents, according, to, the, special, theory, of, relativity, the, partition, of, the, electromagnetic, force, into, separate, electric, and, magnetic, components, is, not, fundamental, but, varies, with, the, observational, frame, of, reference, an, electric, force, perceived, by, one, observer, may, be, perceived, by, another, in, a, different, frame, of, reference, as, a, magnetic, force, or, a, mixture, of, electric, and, magnetic, forces, the, magnetic, field, existing, as, electric, field, in, other, frames, can, be, shown, by, consistency, of, equations, obtained, from, lorentz, transformation, of, four, force, from, coulomb, s, law, in, particle, s, rest, frame, with, maxwell, s, laws, considering, definition, of, fields, from, lorentz, force, and, for, non, accelerating, condition, the, form, of, magnetic, field, hence, obtained, by, lorentz, transformation, of, four, force, from, the, form, of, coulomb, s, law, in, source, s, initial, frame, is, given, by, b, q, 4, 0, r, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, sin, 2, 3, 2, v, r, c, 2, v, e, c, 2, displaystyle, mathbf, b, frac, q, 4, pi, varepsilon, 0, r, 3,

being, non, accelerating, the, above, reduces, to, biot, savart, law, for, non, relativistic, stream, of, current, 1, displaystyle, beta, ll, 1, formally, special, relativity, combines, the, electric, and, magnetic, fields, into, a, rank, 2, tensor, called, the, electromagnetic, tensor, changing, reference, frames, mixes, these, components, this, is, analogous, to, the, way, that, special, relativity, mixes, space, and, time, into, spacetime, and, mass, momentum, and, energy, into, four, momentum, similarly, the, energy, stored, in, a, magnetic, field, is, mixed, with, the, energy, stored, in, an, electric, field, in, the, electromagnetic, stress, energy, tensor, in, advanced, topics, such, as, quantum, mechanics, and, relativity, it, is, often, easier, to, work, with, a, potential, formulation, of, electrodynamics, rather, than, in, terms, of, the, electric, and, magnetic, fields, in, this, representation, the, magnetic, vector, potential, a, and, the, electric,

generalized, potential, energy, per, unit, charge, there, are, multiple, choices, one, can, make, for, the, potential, fields, that, satisfy, the, above, condition, however, the, choice, of, potentials, is, represented, by, its, respective, gauge, condition, maxwell, s, equations, when, expressed, in, terms, of, the, potentials, in, lorenz, gauge, can, be, cast, into, a, form, that, agrees, with, special, relativity, in, relativity, a, together, with, forms, a, four, potential, regardless, of, the, gauge, condition, analogous, to, the, four, momentum, that, combines, the, momentum, and, energy, of, a, particle, using, the, four, potential, instead, of, the, electromagnetic, tensor, has, the, advantage, of, being, much, simpler, and, it, can, be, easily, modified, to, work, with, quantum, mechanics, special, theory, of, relativity, imposes, the, condition, for, events, related, by, cause, and, effect, to, be, time, like, separated, that, is, that, causal, efficacy, propagates, no, faster, than, light, maxwell, s, equations, for, electromagnetism, are, found, to, be, in, favor, of, this, as, electric, and, magnetic, disturbances, are, found, to, travel, at, the,

make, experimentally, observed, predictions, such, as, spontaneous, emission, process, or, lamb, shift, implying, the, need, for, quantization, of, fields, in, modern, physics, the, electromagnetic, field, is, understood, to, be, not, a, classical, field, but, rather, a, quantum, field, it, is, represented, not, as, a, vector, of, three, numbers, at, each, point, but, as, a, vector, of, three, quantum, operators, at, each, point, the, most, accurate, modern, description, of, the, electromagnetic, interaction, and, much, else, is, quantum, electrodynamics, qed, which, is, incorporated, into,

create, electric, and, magnetic, fields, that, in, turn, act, on, the, currents, the, field, at, the, surface, of, the, earth, is, approximately, the, same, as, if, a, giant, bar, magnet, were, positioned, at, the, center, of, the, earth, and, tilted, at, an, angle, of, about, 11, off, the, rotational, axis, of, the, earth, see, the, figure, the, north, pole, of, a, magnetic, compass, needle, points, roughly, north, toward, the, north, magnetic, pole, however, because, a, magnetic, pole, is, attracted, to, its, opposite, the, north, magnetic, pole, is, actually, the, south, pole, of, the, geomagnetic, field, this, confusion, in, terminology, arises, because, the, pole, of, a, magnet, is, defined, by, the, geographical, direction, it, points, earth, s, magnetic, field, is, not, constant, the, strength, of, the, field, and, the, location, of, its, poles, vary, moreover, the, poles, periodically, reverse, their, orientation, in, a, process, called, geomagnetic, reversal, the, most, recent, reversal, occurred, 780, 000, years, ago, the, rotating, magnetic, field, is, a, key, principle, in, the, operation, of, alternating, current, motors, a, permanent, magnet, in, such, a, field, rotates, so, as, to, maintain, its, alignment, with, the, external, field, magnetic, torque, is, used, to, drive, electric, motors, in, one, simple, motor, design, a, magnet, is, fixed, to, a, freely, rotating, shaft, and, subjected, to, a, magnetic, field, from, an, array, of, electromagnets, by, continuously, switching, the, electric, current, through, each, of, the, electromagnets, thereby, flipping, the, polarity, of, their, magnetic, fields, like, poles, are, kept, next, to, the, rotor, the, resultant, torque, is, transferred, to, the, shaft, a, rotating, magnetic, field, can, be, constructed, using, two, orthogonal, coils, with, 90, degrees, phase, difference, in, their, ac, currents, however, in, practice, such, a, system, would, be, supplied, through, a, three, wire, arrangement, with, unequal, currents, this, inequality, would, cause, serious, problems, in, standardization, of, the, conductor, size, and, so, to, overcome, it, three, phase, systems, are, used, where, the, three, currents, are, equal, in, magnitude, and, have, 120, degrees, phase, difference, three, similar, coils, having, mutual, geometrical, angles, of, 120, degrees, create, the, rotating, magnetic, field, in, this, case, the, ability, of, the, three, phase, system, to, create, a, rotating, field, utilized, in, electric, motors, is, one, of, the, main, reasons, why, three, phase, systems, dominate, the, world, s, electrical, power, supply, systems, synchronous, motors, use, dc, voltage, fed, rotor, windings, which, lets, the, excitation, of, the, machine, be, controlled, and, induction, motors, use, short, circuited, rotors, instead, of, a, magnet, following, the, rotating, magnetic, field, of, a, multicoiled, stator, the, short, circuited, turns, of, the, rotor, develop, eddy, currents, in, the, rotating, field, of, the, stator, and, these, currents, in, turn, move, the, rotor, by, the, lorentz, force, the, italian, physicist, galileo, ferraris, and, the, serbian, american, electrical, engineer, nikola, tesla, independently, researched, the, use, of, rotating, magnetic, fields, in, electric, motors, in, 1888, ferraris, published, his, research, in, a, paper, to, the, royal, academy, of, sciences, in, turin, and, tesla, gained, u, s, patent, 381, 968, for, his, work, the, charge, carriers, of, a, current, carrying, conductor, placed, in, a, transverse, magnetic, field, experience, a, sideways, lorentz, force, this, results, in, a, charge, separation, in, a, direction, perpendicular, to, the, current, and, to, the, magnetic, field, the, resultant, voltage, in, that, direction, is, proportional, to, the, applied, magnetic, field, this, is, known, as, the, hall, effect, the, hall, effect, is, often, used, to, measure, the, magnitude, of, a, magnetic, field, it, is, used, as, well, to, find, the, sign, of, the, dominant, charge, carriers, in, materials, such, as, semiconductors, negative, electrons, or, positive, holes, an, important, use, of, h, is, in, magnetic, circuits, where, b, h, inside, a, linear, material, here, is, the, magnetic, permeability, of, the, material, this, result, is, similar, in, form, to, ohm, s, law, j, e,

by, right, hand, thumb, rule, while, magnets, and, some, properties, of, magnetism, were, known, to, ancient, societies, the, research, of, magnetic, fields, began, in, 1269, when, french, scholar, petrus, peregrinus, de, maricourt, mapped, out, the, magnetic, field, on, the, surface, of, a, spherical, magnet, using, iron, needles, noting, the, resulting, field, lines, crossed, at, two, points, he, named, those, points, poles, in, analogy, to, earth, s, poles, he, also, articulated, the, principle, that, magnets, always, have, both, a, north, and, south, pole, no, matter, how, finely, one, slices, them, almost, three, centuries, later, william, gilbert, of, colchester, replicated, petrus, peregrinus, work, and, was, the, first, to, state, explicitly, that, earth, is, a, magnet, 34, published, in, 1600, gilbert, s, work, de, magnete, helped, to, establish, magnetism, as, a, science, in, 1750, john, michell, stated, that, magnetic, poles, attract, and, repel, in, accordance, with, an, inverse, square, law, 56, charles, augustin, de, coulomb, experimentally, verified, this, in, 1785, and, stated, explicitly, that, north, and, south, poles, cannot, be, separated, 59, building, on, this, force, between, poles, sim, on, denis, poisson, 1781, 1840, created, the, first, successful, model, of, the, magnetic, field, which, he, presented, in, 1824, 64, in, this, model, a, magnetic, h, field, is, produced, by, magnetic, poles, and, magnetism, is, due, to, small, pairs, of, north, south, magnetic, poles, three, discoveries, in, 1820, challenged, this, foundation, of, magnetism, hans, christian, rsted, demonstrated, that, a, current, carrying, wire, is, surrounded, by, a, circular, magnetic, field, then, andr, marie, amp, re, showed, that, parallel, wires, with, currents, attract, one, another, if, the, currents, are, in, the, same, direction, and, repel, if, they, are, in, opposite, directions, 87, finally, jean, baptiste, biot, and, f, lix, savart, announced, empirical, results, about, the, forces, that, a, current, carrying, long, straight, wire, exerted, on, a, small, magnet, determining, the, forces, were, inversely, proportional, to, the, perpendicular, distance, from, the, wire, to, the, magnet, 86, laplace, later, deduced, a, law, of, force, based, on, the, differential, action, of, a, differential, section, of, the, wire, which, became, known, as, the, biot, savart, law, as, laplace, did, not, publish, his, findings, extending, these, experiments, amp, re, published, his, own, successful, model, of, magnetism, in, 1825, in, it, he, showed, the, equivalence, of, electrical, currents, to, magnets, 88, and, proposed, that, magnetism, is, due, to, perpetually, flowing, loops, of, current, instead, of, the, dipoles, of, magnetic, charge, in, poisson, s, model, further, amp, re, derived, both, amp, re, s, force, law, describing, the, force, between, two, currents, and, amp, re, s, law, which, like, the, biot, savart, law, correctly, described, the, magnetic, field, generated, by, a, steady, current, also, in, this, work, amp, re, introduced, the, term, electrodynamics, to, describe, the, relationship, between, electricity, and, magnetism, 88, 92, in, 1831, michael, faraday, discovered, electromagnetic, induction, when, he, found, that, a, changing, magnetic, field, generates, an, encircling, electric, field, formulating, what, is, now, known, as, faraday, s, law, of, induction, 189, 192, later, franz, ernst, neumann, proved, that, for, a, moving, conductor, in, a, magnetic, field, induction, is, a, consequence, of, amp, re, s, force, law, 222, in, the, process, he, introduced, the, magnetic, vector, potential, which, was, later, shown, to, be, equivalent, to, the, underlying, mechanism, proposed, by, faraday, 225, in, 1850, lord, kelvin, then, known, as, william, thomson, distinguished, between, two, magnetic, fields, now, denoted, h, and, b, the, former, applied, to, poisson, s, model, and, the, latter, to, amp, re, s, model, and, induction, 224, further, he, derived, how, h, and, b, relate, to, each, other, and, coined, the, term, permeability, 245, between, 1861, and, 1865, james, clerk, maxwell, developed, and, published, maxwell, s, equations, which, explained, and, united, all, of, classical, electricity, and, magnetism, the, first, set, of, these, equations, was, published, in, a, paper, entitled, on, physical, lines, of, force, in, 1861, these, equations, were, valid, but, incomplete, maxwell, completed, his, set, of, equations, in, his, later, 1865, paper, a, dynamical, theory, of, the, electromagnetic, field, and, demonstrated, the, fact, that, light, is, an, electromagnetic, wave, heinrich, hertz, published, papers, in, 1887, and, 1888, experimentally, confirming, this, fact, in, 1887, tesla, developed, an, induction, motor, that, ran, on, alternating, current, the, motor, used, polyphase, current, which, generated, a, rotating, magnetic, field, to, turn, the, motor, a, principle, that, tesla, claimed, to, have, conceived, in, 1882, tesla, received, a, patent, for, his, electric, motor, in, may, 1888, in, 1885, galileo, ferraris, independently, researched, rotating, magnetic, fields, and, subsequently, published, his, research, in, a, paper, to, the, royal, academy, of, sciences, in, turin, just, two, months, before, tesla, was, awarded, his, patent, in, march, 1888, the, twentieth, century, showed, that, classical, electrodynamics, is, already, consistent, with, special, relativity, and, extended, classical, electrodynamics, to, work, with, quantum, mechanics, albert, einstein, in, his, paper, of, 1905, that, established, relativity, showed, that, both, the, electric, and, magnetic, fields, are, part, of, the, same, phenomena, viewed, from, different, reference, frames, finally, the, emergent, field, of, quantum, mechanics, was, merged, with, electrodynamics, to, form, quantum, electrodynamics, which, first, formalized, the, notion, that, electromagnetic, field, energy, is, quantized, in, the, form, of, photons
