a, low, earth, orbit, leo, is, an, orbit, around, earth, with, a, period, of, 128, minutes, or, less, making, at, least, 11, 25, orbits, per, day, and, an, eccentricity, less, than, 0, 25, most, of, the, artificial, objects, in, outer, space, are, in, leo, peaking, in, number, at, an, altitude, around, 800, km, 500, mi, while, the, farthest, in, leo, before, medium, earth, orbit, meo, have, an, altitude, more, than, about, one, third, of, the, radius, of, earth, or, about, 2000, kilometers, roughly, at, the, beginning, of, the, inner, van, allen, radiation, belt, the, term, leo, region, is, also, used, for, the, area, of, space, below, an, altitude, of, 2, 000, km, 1, 200, mi, about, one, third, of, earth, s, radius, objects, in, orbits, that, pass, through, this, zone, even, if, they, have, an, apogee, further, out, or, are, sub, orbital, are, carefully, tracked, since, they, present, a, collision, risk, to, the, many, leo, satellites, no, human, spaceflights, other, than, the, lunar, missions, of, the, apollo, program, have, taken, place, beyond, leo, all, space, stations, to, date, have, operated, geocentric, within, leo, a, wide, variety, of, sources, define, leo, in, terms, of, altitude, the, altitude, of, an, object, in, an, elliptic, orbit, can, vary, significantly, along, the, orbit, even, for, circular, orbits, the, altitude, above, ground, can, vary, by, as, much, as, 30, km, 19, mi, especially, for, polar, orbits, due, to, the, oblateness, of, earth, s, spheroid, figure, and, local, topography, while, definitions, based, on, altitude, are, inherently, ambiguous, most, of, them, fall, within, the, range, specified, by, an, orbit, period, of, 128, minutes, because, according, to, kepler, s, third, law, this, corresponds, to, a, semi, major, axis, of, 8, 413, km, 5, 228, mi, for, circular, orbits, this, in, turn, corresponds, to, an, altitude, of, 2, 042, km, 1, 269, mi, above, the, mean, radius, of, earth, which, is, consistent, with, some, of, the, upper, altitude, limits, in, some, leo, definitions, the, leo, region, is, defined, by, some, sources, as, a, region, in, space, that, leo, orbits, occupy, some, highly, elliptical, orbits, may, pass, through, the, leo, region, near, their, lowest, altitude, or, perigee, but, are, not, in, a, leo, orbit, because, their, highest, altitude, or, apogee, exceeds, 2, 000, km, 1, 243, mi, sub, orbital, objects, can, also, reach, the, leo, region, but, are, not, in, a, leo, orbit, because, they, re, enter, the, atmosphere, the, distinction, between, leo, orbits, and, the, leo, region, is, especially, important, for, analysis, of, possible, collisions, between, objects, which, may, not, themselves, be, in, leo, but, could, collide, with, satellites, or, debris, in, leo, orbits, the, mean, orbital, velocity, needed, to, maintain, a, stable, low, earth, orbit, is, about, 7, 8, km, s, 4, 8, mi, s, which, translates, to, 28, 000, km, h, 17, 000, mph, however, this, depends, on, the, exact, altitude, of, the, orbit, calculated, for, a, circular, orbit, of, 200, km, 120, mi, the, orbital, velocity, is, 7, 79, km, s, 4, 84, mi, s, but, for, a, higher, 1, 500, km, 930, mi, orbit, the, velocity, is, reduced, to, 7, 12, km, s, 4, 42, mi, s, the, launch, vehicle, s, delta, v, needed, to, achieve, low, earth, orbit, starts, around, 9, 4, km, s, 5, 8, mi, s, the, pull, of, gravity, in, leo, is, only, slightly, less, than, on, the, earth, s, surface, this, is, because, the, distance, to, leo, from, the, earth, s, surface, is, much, less, than, the, earth, s, radius, however, an, object, in, orbit, is, in, a, permanent, free, fall, around, earth, because, in, orbit, the, gravitational, force, and, the, centrifugal, force, balance, each, other, out, as, a, result, spacecraft, in, orbit, continue, to, stay, in, orbit, and, people, inside, or, outside, such, craft, continuously, experience, weightlessness, objects, in, leo, encounter, atmospheric, drag, from, gases, in, the, thermosphere, approximately, 80, 600, km, above, the, surface, or, exosphere, approximately, 600, km, or, 400, mi, and, higher, depending, on, orbit, height, orbits, of, satellites, that, reach, altitudes, below, 300, km, 190, mi, decay, fast, due, to, atmospheric, drag, objects, in, leo, orbit, earth, between, the, denser, part, of, the, atmosphere, and, below, the, inner, van, allen, radiation, belt, equatorial, low, earth, orbits, eleo, are, a, subset, of, leo, these, orbits, with, low, inclination, to, the, equator, allow, rapid, revisit, times, over, low, latitude, locations, on, earth, prograde, equatorial, leos, also, have, lower, delta, v, launch, requirements, because, they, take, advantage, of, the, earth, s, rotation, other, useful, leo, orbits, including, polar, orbits, and, sun, synchronous, orbits, have, a, higher, inclinations, to, the, equator, and, provide, coverage, for, higher, latitudes, on, earth, some, of, the, first, generation, of, starlink, satellites, used, polar, orbits, which, provide, coverage, everywhere, on, earth, later, starlink, constellations, orbit, at, a, lower, inclination, and, provide, more, coverage, for, populated, areas, higher, orbits, include, medium, earth, orbit, meo, sometimes, called, intermediate, circular, orbit, ico, and, further, above, geostationary, orbit, geo, orbits, higher, than, low, orbit, can, lead, to, early, failure, of, electronic, components, due, to, intense, radiation, and, charge, accumulation, in, 2017, very, low, earth, orbits, vleo, began, to, be, seen, in, regulatory, filings, these, orbits, below, about, 450, km, 280, mi, require, the, use, of, novel, technologies, for, orbit, raising, because, they, operate, in, orbits, that, would, ordinarily, decay, too, soon, to, be, economically, useful, a, low, earth, orbit, requires, the, lowest, amount, of, energy, for, satellite, placement, it, provides, high, bandwidth, and, low, communication, latency, satellites, and, space, stations, in, leo, are, more, accessible, for, crew, and, servicing, since, it, requires, less, energy, to, place, a, satellite, into, a, leo, and, a, satellite, there, needs, less, powerful, amplifiers, for, successful, transmission, leo, is, used, for, many, communication, applications, such, as, the, iridium, phone, system, some, communication, satellites, use, much, higher, geostationary, orbits, and, move, at, the, same, angular, velocity, as, the, earth, as, to, appear, stationary, above, one, location, on, the, planet, unlike, geosynchronous, satellites, satellites, in, low, orbit, have, a, small, field, of, view, and, can, only, observe, and, communicate, with, a, fraction, of, the, earth, at, a, given, time, this, means, that, a, large, network, or, constellation, of, satellites, is, required, to, provide, continuous, coverage, satellites, at, lower, altitudes, of, orbit, are, in, the, atmosphere, and, suffer, from, rapid, orbital, decay, requiring, either, periodic, re, boosting, to, maintain, stable, orbits, or, the, launching, of, replacements, for, those, that, re, enter, the, atmosphere, the, effects, of, adding, such, quantities, of, vaporized, metals, to, earth, s, stratosphere, are, potentially, of, concern, but, currently, unknown, the, leo, environment, is, becoming, congested, with, space, debris, because, of, the, frequency, of, object, launches, this, has, caused, growing, concern, in, recent, years, since, collisions, at, orbital, velocities, can, be, dangerous, or, deadly, collisions, can, produce, additional, space, debris, creating, a, domino, effect, known, as, kessler, syndrome, nasa, s, orbital, debris, program, tracks, over, 25, 000, objects, larger, than, 10, cm, diameter, in, leo, while, the, estimated, number, between, 1, and, 10, cm, is, 500, 000, and, the, number, of, particles, bigger, than, 1, mm, exceeds, 100, million, the, particles, travel, at, speeds, up, to, 7, 8, km, s, 28, 000, km, h, 17, 500, mph, so, even, a, small, impact, can, severely, damage, a, spacecraft, this, article, incorporates, public, domain, material, from, websites, or, documents, of, the, national,
