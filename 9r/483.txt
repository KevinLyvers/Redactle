sodium, silicate, is, a, generic, name, for, chemical, compounds, with, the, formula, na, 2, x, si, y, o, 2, y, x, or, na, 2, o, x, sio, 2, y, such, as, sodium, metasilicate, na, 2, sio, 3, sodium, orthosilicate, na, 4, sio, 4, and, sodium, pyrosilicate, na, 6, si, 2, o, 7, the, anions, are, often, polymeric, these, compounds, are, generally, colorless, transparent, solids, or, white, powders, and, soluble, in, water, in, various, amounts, sodium, silicate, is, also, the, technical, and, common, name, for, a, mixture, of, such, compounds, chiefly, the, metasilicate, also, called, waterglass, water, glass, or, liquid, glass, the, product, has, a, wide, variety, of, uses, including, the, formulation, of, cements, coatings, passive, fire, protection, textile, and, lumber, processing, manufacture, of, refractory, ceramics, as, adhesives, and, in, the, production, of, silica, gel, the, commercial, product, available, in, water, solution, or, in, solid, form, is, often, greenish, or, blue, owing, to, the, presence, of, iron, containing, impurities, in, industry, the, various, grades, of, sodium, silicate, are, characterized, by, their, sio, 2, na, 2, o, weight, ratio, which, can, be, converted, to, molar, ratio, by, multiplication, with, 1, 032, the, ratio, can, vary, between, 1, 2, and, 3, 75, 1, grades, with, ratio, below, 2, 85, 1, are, termed, alkaline, those, with, a, higher, sio, 2, na, 2, o, ratio, are, described, as, neutral, soluble, silicates, of, alkali, metals, sodium, or, potassium, were, observed, by, european, alchemists, in, the, 16th, century, giambattista, della, porta, observed, in, 1567, that, tartari, salis, cream, of, tartar, potassium, bitartrate, caused, powdered, crystallum, quartz, to, melt, at, a, lower, temperature, other, possible, early, references, to, alkali, silicates, were, made, by, basil, valentine, in, 1520, and, by, agricola, in, 1550, around, 1640, jan, baptist, van, helmont, reported, the, formation, of, alkali, silicates, as, a, soluble, substance, made, by, melting, sand, with, excess, alkali, and, observed, that, the, silica, could, be, precipitated, quantitatively, by, adding, acid, to, the, solution, in, 1646, glauber, made, potassium, silicate, which, he, called, liquor, silicum, by, melting, potassium, carbonate, obtained, by, calcinating, cream, of, tartar, and, sand, in, a, crucible, and, keeping, it, molten, until, it, ceased, to, bubble, due, to, the, release, of, carbon, dioxide, the, mixture, was, allowed, to, cool, and, then, was, ground, to, a, fine, powder, when, the, powder, was, exposed, to, moist, air, it, gradually, formed, a, viscous, liquid, which, glauber, called, oleum, oder, liquor, silicum, aren, vel, crystallorum, i, e, oil, or, solution, of, silica, sand, or, quartz, crystal, however, it, was, later, claimed, that, the, substances, prepared, by, those, alchemists, were, not, waterglass, as, it, is, understood, today, that, would, have, been, prepared, in, 1818, by, johann, nepomuk, von, fuchs, by, treating, silicic, acid, with, an, alkali, the, result, being, soluble, in, water, but, not, affected, by, atmospheric, changes, the, terms, water, glass, and, soluble, glass, were, used, by, leopold, wolff, in, 1846, by, mile, kopp, in, 1857, and, by, hermann, kr, tzer, in, 1887, in, 1892, rudolf, von, wagner, distinguished, soda, potash, double, soda, and, potash, and, fixing, i, e, stabilizing, as, types, of, water, glass, the, fixing, type, was, a, mixture, of, silica, well, saturated, with, potash, water, glass, and, a, sodium, silicate, used, to, stabilize, inorganic, water, color, pigments, on, cement, work, for, outdoor, signs, and, murals, sodium, silicates, are, colorless, glassy, or, crystalline, solids, or, white, powders, except, for, the, most, silicon, rich, ones, they, are, readily, soluble, in, water, producing, alkaline, solutions, when, dried, up, it, still, can, be, rehydrated, back, in, water, sodium, silicates, are, stable, in, neutral, and, alkaline, solutions, in, acidic, solutions, the, silicate, ions, react, with, hydrogen, ions, to, form, silicic, acids, which, tend, to, decompose, into, hydrated, silicon, dioxide, gel, heated, to, drive, off, the, water, the, result, is, a, hard, translucent, substance, called, silica, gel, widely, used, as, a, desiccant, it, can, withstand, temperatures, up, to, 1100, c, solutions, of, sodium, silicates, can, be, produced, by, treating, a, mixture, of, silica, usually, as, quartz, sand, caustic, soda, and, water, with, hot, steam, in, a, reactor, the, overall, reaction, is, sodium, silicates, can, also, be, obtained, by, dissolving, silica, sio, 2, whose, melting, point, is, 1713, c, in, molten, sodium, carbonate, that, melts, with, decomposition, at, 851, c, the, material, can, be, obtained, also, from, sodium, sulfate, melting, point, 884, c, with, carbon, as, a, reducing, agent, in, 1990, 4, million, tons, of, alkali, metal, silicates, were, produced, sodium, silicate, may, be, produced, as, a, part, of, hydrogen, production, by, dissolving, ferrosilicon, in, an, aqueous, sodium, hydroxide, naoh, h, 2, o, solution, though, unprofitable, na, 2, sio, 3, is, a, byproduct, of, bayer, process, which, is, often, converted, to, calcium, silicate, ca, 2, sio, 4, the, main, applications, of, sodium, silicates, are, in, detergents, paper, industry, as, a, deinking, agent, water, treatment, and, construction, materials, the, adhesive, properties, of, sodium, silicate, were, noted, as, early, as, the, 1850s, and, have, been, widely, used, at, least, since, the, first, world, war, the, largest, application, of, sodium, silicate, solutions, is, a, cement, for, producing, cardboard, when, used, as, a, paper, cement, the, sodium, silicate, joint, tends, to, crack, within, a, few, years, at, which, point, it, no, longer, holds, the, paper, surfaces, cemented, together, sodium, silicate, solutions, can, also, be, used, as, a, spin, on, adhesive, layer, to, bond, glass, to, glass, or, a, silicon, dioxide, covered, silicon, wafer, to, one, another, sodium, silicate, glass, to, glass, bonding, has, the, advantage, that, it, is, a, low, temperature, bonding, technique, as, opposed, to, fusion, bonding, it, also, requires, less, processing, than, glass, to, glass, anodic, bonding, which, requires, an, intermediate, layer, such, as, silicon, nitride, sin, to, act, as, a, diffusion, barrier, for, sodium, ions, the, deposition, of, such, a, layer, requires, a, low, pressure, chemical, vapor, deposition, step, a, disadvantage, of, sodium, silicate, bonding, however, is, that, it, is, very, difficult, to, eliminate, air, bubbles, this, is, in, part, because, the, technique, does, not, require, a, vacuum, and, also, does, not, use, field, assistance, as, in, anodic, bonding, this, lack, of, field, assistance, can, sometimes, be, beneficial, because, field, assistance, can, provide, such, high, attraction, between, wafers, as, to, bend, a, thinner, wafer, and, collapse, onto, nanofluidic, cavity, or, mems, elements, sodium, silicate, may, be, used, for, various, paints, and, coatings, such, as, those, used, on, welding, rods, such, coatings, can, be, cured, in, two, ways, one, method, is, to, heat, a, thin, layer, of, sodium, silicate, into, a, gel, and, then, into, a, hard, film, to, make, the, coating, water, resistant, high, temperatures, of, 100, c, 212, f, 373, k, are, needed, the, temperature, is, slowly, raised, to, 150, c, 302, f, 423, k, to, dehydrate, the, film, and, avoid, steaming, and, blistering, the, process, must, be, relatively, slow, but, infrared, lamps, may, be, used, at, first, in, the, other, method, when, high, temperatures, are, not, practical, the, water, resistance, may, be, achieved, by, chemicals, or, esters, such, as, boric, acid, phosphoric, acid, sodium, fluorosilicate, and, aluminium, phosphate, before, application, an, aqueous, solution, of, sodium, silicate, is, mixed, with, a, curing, agent, sodium, silicate, is, frequently, used, in, drilling, fluids, to, stabilize, and, avoid, the, collapse, of, borehole, walls, it, is, particularly, useful, when, drill, holes, pass, through, argillaceous, formations, containing, swelling, clay, minerals, such, as, smectite, or, montmorillonite, concrete, treated, with, a, sodium, silicate, solution, helps, to, reduce, porosity, in, most, masonry, products, such, as, concrete, stucco, and, plasters, this, effect, aids, in, reducing, water, penetration, but, has, no, known, effect, on, reducing, water, vapor, transmission, and, emission, a, chemical, reaction, occurs, with, the, excess, ca, oh, 2, portlandite, present, in, the, concrete, that, permanently, binds, the, silicates, with, the, surface, making, them, far, more, durable, and, water, repellent, this, treatment, generally, is, applied, only, after, the, initial, cure, has, taken, place, approximately, seven, days, depending, on, conditions, these, coatings, are, known, as, silicate, mineral, paint, an, example, of, the, reaction, of, sodium, silicate, with, the, calcium, hydroxide, found, in, concrete, to, form, calcium, silicate, hydrate, csh, gel, the, main, product, in, hydrated, portland, cement, follows, it, is, used, in, detergent, auxiliaries, such, as, complex, sodium, disilicate, and, modified, sodium, disilicate, the, detergent, granules, gain, their, ruggedness, from, a, coating, of, silicates, sodium, silicate, is, used, as, an, alum, coagulant, and, an, iron, flocculant, in, wastewater, treatment, plants, sodium, silicate, binds, to, colloidal, molecules, creating, larger, aggregates, that, sink, to, the, bottom, of, the, water, column, the, microscopic, negatively, charged, particles, suspended, in, water, interact, with, sodium, silicate, their, electrical, double, layer, collapses, due, to, the, increase, of, ionic, strength, caused, by, the, addition, of, sodium, silicate, doubly, negatively, charged, anion, accompanied, by, two, sodium, cations, and, they, subsequently, aggregate, this, process, is, called, coagulation, water, glass, is, a, useful, binder, for, solids, such, as, vermiculite, and, perlite, when, blended, with, the, latter, lightweight, fraction, water, glass, can, be, used, to, make, hard, high, temperature, insulation, boards, used, for, refractories, passive, fire, protection, and, high, temperature, insulations, such, as, in, moulded, pipe, insulation, applications, when, mixed, with, finely, divided, mineral, powders, such, as, vermiculite, dust, which, is, common, scrap, from, the, exfoliation, process, one, can, produce, high, temperature, adhesives, the, intumescence, disappears, in, the, presence, of, finely, divided, mineral, dust, whereby, the, waterglass, becomes, a, mere, matrix, waterglass, is, inexpensive, and, abundantly, available, which, makes, its, use, popular, in, many, refractory, applications, it, is, used, as, a, binder, of, the, sand, when, doing, sand, casting, of, all, common, metals, it, allows, for, the, rapid, production, of, a, strong, mold, or, core, by, three, main, methods, since, the, sodium, silicate, does, not, burn, during, casting, it, can, actually, melt, at, pouring, temperatures, above, 1800, f, it, is, common, to, add, organic, materials, to, provide, for, enhanced, sand, breakdown, after, casting, the, additives, include, sugar, starch, carbons, wood, flour, and, phenolic, resins, sodium, silicate, solution, is, used, as, a, fixative, for, hand, dyeing, with, reactive, dyes, that, require, a, high, ph, to, react, with, the, textile, fiber, after, the, dye, is, applied, to, a, cellulose, based, fabric, such, as, cotton, or, rayon, or, onto, silk, it, is, allowed, to, dry, after, which, the, sodium, silicate, is, painted, on, to, the, dyed, fabric, covered, with, plastic, to, retain, moisture, and, left, to, react, for, an, hour, at, room, temperature, sodium, silicate, is, used, along, with, magnesium, silicate, in, muffler, repair, and, fitting, paste, when, dissolved, in, water, both, sodium, silicate, and, magnesium, silicate, form, a, thick, paste, that, is, easy, to, apply, when, the, exhaust, system, of, an, internal, combustion, engine, heats, up, to, its, operating, temperature, the, heat, drives, out, all, of, the, excess, water, from, the, paste, the, silicate, compounds, that, are, left, over, have, glass, like, properties, making, a, temporary, brittle, repair, sodium, silicate, is, also, used, currently, as, an, exhaust, system, joint, and, crack, sealer, for, repairing, mufflers, resonators, tailpipes, and, other, exhaust, components, with, and, without, fiberglass, reinforcing, tapes, in, this, application, the, sodium, silicate, 60, 70, is, typically, mixed, with, kaolin, 40, 30, an, aluminium, silicate, mineral, to, make, the, sodium, silicate, glued, joint, opaque, the, sodium, silicate, however, is, the, high, temperature, adhesive, the, kaolin, serves, simply, as, a, compatible, high, temperature, coloring, agent, some, of, these, repair, compounds, also, contain, glass, fibres, to, enhance, their, gap, filling, abilities, and, reduce, brittleness, sodium, silicate, can, be, used, to, fill, gaps, in, the, head, gasket, of, an, engine, this, is, especially, useful, for, aluminum, alloy, cylinder, heads, which, are, sensitive, to, thermally, induced, surface, deflection, sodium, silicate, is, added, to, the, cooling, system, through, the, radiator, and, allowed, to, circulate, when, the, sodium, silicate, reaches, its, conversion, temperature, of, 100, 105, c, 212, 221, f, it, loses, water, molecules, and, forms, a, glass, seal, with, a, re, melting, temperature, above, 810, c, 1, 490, f, this, repair, can, last, two, years, or, longer, and, symptoms, disappear, instantly, however, this, repair, works, only, when, the, sodium, silicate, reaches, its, conversion, temperature, also, sodium, silicate, glass, particulate, contamination, of, lubricants, is, detrimental, to, their, function, and, contamination, of, engine, oil, is, a, serious, possibility, in, situations, in, which, a, coolant, to, oil, leak, is, present, sodium, silicate, solution, is, used, to, inexpensively, quickly, and, permanently, disable, automobile, engines, running, an, engine, with, half, a, u, s, gallon, or, about, two, liters, of, a, sodium, silicate, solution, instead, of, motor, oil, causes, the, solution, to, precipitate, catastrophically, damaging, the, engine, s, bearings, and, pistons, within, a, few, minutes, in, the, united, states, this, procedure, was, used, to, comply, with, requirements, of, the, car, allowance, rebate, system, cars, program, a, mixture, of, sodium, silicate, and, sawdust, has, been, used, in, between, the, double, skin, of, certain, safes, this, not, only, makes, them, more, fire, resistant, but, also, makes, cutting, them, open, with, an, oxyacetylene, torch, extremely, difficult, due, to, the, smoke, emitted, when, crystals, of, a, number, of, metallic, salts, are, dropped, into, a, solution, of, water, glass, simple, or, branching, stalagmites, of, colored, metal, silicates, are, formed, this, phenomenon, has, been, used, by, manufacturers, of, toys, and, chemistry, sets, to, provide, instructive, enjoyment, to, many, generations, of, children, from, the, early, 20th, century, until, the, present, an, early, mention, of, crystals, of, metallic, salts, forming, a, chemical, garden, in, sodium, silicate, is, found, in, the, 1946, modern, mechanix, magazine, metal, salts, used, included, the, sulfates, and, or, chlorides, of, copper, cobalt, iron, nickel, and, manganese, sodium, silicate, is, used, as, a, deflocculant, in, casting, slips, helping, reduce, viscosity, and, the, need, for, large, amounts, of, water, to, liquidize, the, clay, body, it, is, also, used, to, create, a, crackle, effect, in, pottery, usually, wheel, thrown, a, vase, or, bottle, is, thrown, on, the, wheel, fairly, narrow, and, with, thick, walls, sodium, silicate, is, brushed, on, a, section, of, the, piece, after, five, minutes, the, wall, of, the, piece, is, stretched, outward, with, a, rib, or, hand, the, result, is, a, wrinkled, or, cracked, look, it, is, also, the, main, agent, in, magic, water, which, is, used, when, joining, clay, pieces, especially, if, the, moisture, level, of, the, two, differs, sodium, silicate, with, additives, was, injected, into, the, ground, to, harden, it, and, thereby, to, prevent, further, leakage, of, highly, radioactive, water, from, the, fukushima, daiichi, nuclear, power, plant, in, japan, in, april, 2011, the, residual, heat, carried, by, the, water, used, for, cooling, the, damaged, reactors, accelerated, the, setting, of, the, injected, mixture, on, june, 3, 1958, the, uss, nautilus, the, world, s, first, nuclear, submarine, visited, everett, and, seattle, in, seattle, crewmen, dressed, in, civilian, clothing, were, sent, in, to, secretly, buy, 140, quarts, 160, liters, of, an, automotive, product, containing, sodium, silicate, originally, identified, as, stop, leak, to, repair, a, leaking, condenser, system, the, nautilus, was, en, route, to, the, north, pole, on, a, top, secret, mission, to, cross, the, north, pole, submerged, a, historical, use, of, the, adhesive, properties, of, sodium, silicates, is, the, production, of, paper, cartridges, for, black, powder, revolvers, produced, by, colt, s, manufacturing, company, between, 1851, and, 1873, especially, during, the, american, civil, war, sodium, silicate, was, used, to, seal, combustible, nitrated, paper, together, to, form, a, conical, paper, cartridge, to, hold, the, black, powder, as, well, as, to, cement, the, lead, ball, or, conical, bullet, into, the, open, end, of, the, paper, cartridge, such, sodium, silicate, cemented, paper, cartridges, were, inserted, into, the, cylinders, of, revolvers, thereby, speeding, the, reloading, of, cap, and, ball, black, powder, revolvers, this, use, largely, ended, with, the, introduction, of, colt, revolvers, employing, brass, cased, cartridges, starting, in, 1873, similarly, sodium, silicate, was, also, used, to, cement, the, top, wad, into, brass, shotgun, shells, thereby, eliminating, any, need, for, a, crimp, at, the, top, of, the, brass, shotgun, shell, to, hold, a, shotgun, shell, together, reloading, brass, shotgun, shells, was, widely, practiced, by, self, reliant, american, farmers, during, the, 1870s, using, the, same, waterglass, material, that, was, also, used, to, preserve, eggs, the, cementing, of, the, top, wad, on, a, shotgun, shell, consisted, of, applying, from, three, to, five, drops, of, waterglass, on, the, top, wad, to, secure, it, to, the, brass, hull, brass, hulls, for, shotgun, shells, were, superseded, by, paper, hulls, starting, around, 1877, the, newer, paper, hulled, shotgun, shells, used, a, roll, crimp, in, place, of, a, waterglass, cemented, joint, to, hold, the, top, wad, in, the, shell, however, whereas, brass, shotshells, with, top, wads, cemented, with, waterglass, could, be, reloaded, nearly, indefinitely, given, powder, wad, and, shot, of, course, the, paper, hulls, that, replaced, the, brass, hulls, could, be, reloaded, only, a, few, times, sodium, silicate, and, other, silicates, are, the, primary, components, in, instant, wrinkle, remover, creams, which, temporarily, tighten, the, skin, to, minimize, the, appearance, of, wrinkles, and, under, eye, bags, these, creams, when, applied, as, a, thin, film, and, allowed, to, dry, for, a, few, minutes, can, present, dramatic, results, this, effect, is, not, permanent, lasting, from, a, few, minutes, up, to, a, couple, of, hours, it, works, like, water, cement, once, the, muscle, starts, to, move, it, cracks, and, leaves, white, residues, on, the, skin, waterglass, has, been, used, as, an, egg, preservative, with, large, success, primarily, when, refrigeration, is, not, available, fresh, laid, eggs, are, immersed, in, a, solution, of, sodium, silicate, waterglass, after, being, immersed, in, the, solution, they, are, removed, and, allowed, to, dry, a, permanent, air, tight, coating, remains, on, the, eggs, if, they, are, then, stored, in, appropriate, environment, the, majority, of, bacteria, which, would, otherwise, cause, them, to, spoil, are, kept, out, and, their, moisture, is, kept, in, according, to, the, cited, source, treated, eggs, can, be, kept, fresh, using, this, method, for, up, to, five, months, when, boiling, eggs, preserved, that, way, the, shell, is, no, longer, permeable, to, air, and, the, egg, will, tend, to, crack, unless, a, hole, in, the, shell, is, made, e, g, with, a, pin, in, order, to, allow, steam, to, escape, sodium, silicate, s, flocculant, properties, are, also, used, to, clarify, wine, and, beer, by, precipitating, colloidal, particles, as, a, clearing, agent, though, sodium, silicate, is, sometimes, confused, with, isinglass, which, is, prepared, from, collagen, extracted, from, the, dried, swim, bladders, of, sturgeon, and, other, fishes, eggs, can, be, preserved, in, a, bucket, of, waterglass, gel, and, their, shells, are, sometimes, also, used, baked, and, crushed, to, clear, wine, sodium, silicate, gel, is, also, used, as, a, substrate, for, algal, growth, in, aquaculture, hatcheries
