direct, current, dc, is, one, directional, flow, of, electric, charge, an, electrochemical, cell, is, a, prime, example, of, dc, power, direct, current, may, flow, through, a, conductor, such, as, a, wire, but, can, also, flow, through, semiconductors, insulators, or, even, through, a, vacuum, as, in, electron, or, ion, beams, the, electric, current, flows, in, a, constant, direction, distinguishing, it, from, alternating, current, ac, a, term, formerly, used, for, this, type, of, current, was, galvanic, current, the, abbreviations, ac, and, dc, are, often, used, to, mean, simply, alternating, and, direct, as, when, they, modify, current, or, voltage, direct, current, may, be, converted, from, an, alternating, current, supply, by, use, of, a, rectifier, which, contains, electronic, elements, usually, or, electromechanical, elements, historically, that, allow, current, to, flow, only, in, one, direction, direct, current, may, be, converted, into, alternating, current, via, an, inverter, direct, current, has, many, uses, from, the, charging, of, batteries, to, large, power, supplies, for, electronic, systems, motors, and, more, very, large, quantities, of, electrical, energy, provided, via, direct, current, are, used, in, smelting, of, aluminum, and, other, electrochemical, processes, it, is, also, used, for, some, railways, especially, in, urban, areas, high, voltage, direct, current, is, used, to, transmit, large, amounts, of, power, from, remote, generation, sites, or, to, interconnect, alternating, current, power, grids, direct, current, was, produced, in, 1800, by, italian, physicist, alessandro, volta, s, battery, his, voltaic, pile, the, nature, of, how, current, flowed, was, not, yet, understood, french, physicist, andr, marie, amp, re, conjectured, that, current, travelled, in, one, direction, from, positive, to, negative, when, french, instrument, maker, hippolyte, pixii, built, the, first, dynamo, electric, generator, in, 1832, he, found, that, as, the, magnet, used, passed, the, loops, of, wire, each, half, turn, it, caused, the, flow, of, electricity, to, reverse, generating, an, alternating, current, at, amp, re, s, suggestion, pixii, later, added, a, commutator, a, type, of, switch, where, contacts, on, the, shaft, work, with, brush, contacts, to, produce, direct, current, the, late, 1870s, and, early, 1880s, saw, electricity, starting, to, be, generated, at, power, stations, these, were, initially, set, up, to, power, arc, lighting, a, popular, type, of, street, lighting, running, on, very, high, voltage, usually, higher, than, 3, 000, volts, direct, current, or, alternating, current, this, was, followed, by, the, widespread, use, of, low, voltage, direct, current, for, indoor, electric, lighting, in, business, and, homes, after, inventor, thomas, edison, launched, his, incandescent, bulb, based, electric, utility, in, 1882, because, of, the, significant, advantages, of, alternating, current, over, direct, current, in, using, transformers, to, raise, and, lower, voltages, to, allow, much, longer, transmission, distances, direct, current, was, replaced, over, the, next, few, decades, by, alternating, current, in, power, delivery, in, the, mid, 1950s, high, voltage, direct, current, transmission, was, developed, and, is, now, an, option, instead, of, long, distance, high, voltage, alternating, current, systems, for, long, distance, undersea, cables, e, g, between, countries, such, as, norned, this, dc, option, is, the, only, technically, feasible, option, for, applications, requiring, direct, current, such, as, third, rail, power, systems, alternating, current, is, distributed, to, a, substation, which, utilizes, a, rectifier, to, convert, the, power, to, direct, current, the, term, dc, is, used, to, refer, to, power, systems, that, use, only, one, electrical, polarity, of, voltage, or, current, and, to, refer, to, the, constant, zero, frequency, or, slowly, varying, local, mean, value, of, a, voltage, or, current, for, example, the, voltage, across, a, dc, voltage, source, is, constant, as, is, the, current, through, a, direct, current, source, the, dc, solution, of, an, electric, circuit, is, the, solution, where, all, voltages, and, currents, are, constant, any, stationary, voltage, or, current, waveform, can, be, decomposed, into, a, sum, of, a, dc, component, and, a, zero, mean, time, varying, component, the, dc, component, is, defined, to, be, the, expected, value, or, the, average, value, of, the, voltage, or, current, over, all, time, although, dc, stands, for, direct, current, dc, often, refers, to, constant, polarity, under, this, definition, dc, voltages, can, vary, in, time, as, seen, in, the, raw, output, of, a, rectifier, or, the, fluctuating, voice, signal, on, a, telephone, line, some, forms, of, dc, such, as, that, produced, by, a, voltage, regulator, have, almost, no, variations, in, voltage, but, may, still, have, variations, in, output, power, and, current, a, direct, current, circuit, is, an, electrical, circuit, that, consists, of, any, combination, of, constant, voltage, sources, constant, current, sources, and, resistors, in, this, case, the, circuit, voltages, and, currents, are, independent, of, time, a, particular, circuit, voltage, or, current, does, not, depend, on, the, past, value, of, any, circuit, voltage, or, current, this, implies, that, the, system, of, equations, that, represent, a, dc, circuit, do, not, involve, integrals, or, derivatives, with, respect, to, time, if, a, capacitor, or, inductor, is, added, to, a, dc, circuit, the, resulting, circuit, is, not, strictly, speaking, a, dc, circuit, however, most, such, circuits, have, a, dc, solution, this, solution, gives, the, circuit, voltages, and, currents, when, the, circuit, is, in, dc, steady, state, such, a, circuit, is, represented, by, a, system, of, differential, equations, the, solution, to, these, equations, usually, contain, a, time, varying, or, transient, part, as, well, as, constant, or, steady, state, part, it, is, this, steady, state, part, that, is, the, dc, solution, there, are, some, circuits, that, do, not, have, a, dc, solution, two, simple, examples, are, a, constant, current, source, connected, to, a, capacitor, and, a, constant, voltage, source, connected, to, an, inductor, in, electronics, it, is, common, to, refer, to, a, circuit, that, is, powered, by, a, dc, voltage, source, such, as, a, battery, or, the, output, of, a, dc, power, supply, as, a, dc, circuit, even, though, what, is, meant, is, that, the, circuit, is, dc, powered, in, a, dc, circuit, a, power, source, e, g, a, battery, capacitor, etc, has, a, positive, and, negative, terminal, and, likewise, the, load, also, has, a, positive, and, negative, terminal, to, complete, the, circuit, positive, charges, need, to, flow, from, the, power, source, to, the, load, the, charges, will, then, return, to, the, negative, terminal, of, the, load, which, will, then, flow, back, to, the, negative, terminal, of, the, battery, completing, the, circuit, if, either, the, positive, or, negative, terminal, is, disconnected, the, circuit, will, not, be, complete, and, the, charges, will, not, flow, in, some, dc, circuit, applications, polarity, does, not, matter, which, means, you, can, connect, positive, and, negative, backwards, and, the, circuit, will, still, be, complete, and, the, load, will, still, function, normally, however, in, most, dc, applications, polarity, does, matter, and, connecting, the, circuit, backwards, will, result, in, the, load, not, working, properly, dc, is, commonly, found, in, many, extra, low, voltage, applications, and, some, low, voltage, applications, especially, where, these, are, powered, by, batteries, or, solar, power, systems, since, both, can, produce, only, dc, most, electronic, circuits, or, devices, require, a, dc, power, supply, domestic, dc, installations, usually, have, different, types, of, sockets, connectors, switches, and, fixtures, from, those, suitable, for, alternating, current, this, is, mostly, due, to, the, lower, voltages, used, resulting, in, higher, currents, to, produce, the, same, amount, of, power, it, is, usually, important, with, a, dc, appliance, to, observe, polarity, unless, the, device, has, a, diode, bridge, to, correct, for, this, most, automotive, applications, use, dc, an, automotive, battery, provides, power, for, engine, starting, lighting, the, ignition, system, the, climate, controls, and, the, infotainment, system, among, others, the, alternator, is, an, ac, device, which, uses, a, rectifier, to, produce, dc, for, battery, charging, most, highway, passenger, vehicles, use, nominally, 12, v, systems, many, heavy, trucks, farm, equipment, or, earth, moving, equipment, with, diesel, engines, use, 24, volt, systems, in, some, older, vehicles, 6, v, was, used, such, as, in, the, original, classic, volkswagen, beetle, at, one, point, a, 42, v, electrical, system, was, considered, for, automobiles, but, this, found, little, use, to, save, weight, and, wire, often, the, metal, frame, of, the, vehicle, is, connected, to, one, pole, of, the, battery, and, used, as, the, return, conductor, in, a, circuit, often, the, negative, pole, is, the, chassis, ground, connection, but, positive, ground, may, be, used, in, some, wheeled, or, marine, vehicles, in, a, battery, electric, vehicle, there, are, usually, two, separate, dc, systems, the, low, voltage, dc, system, typically, operates, at, 12v, and, serves, the, same, purpose, as, in, an, internal, combustion, engine, vehicle, the, high, voltage, system, operates, at, 300, 400v, depending, on, the, vehicle, and, provides, the, power, for, the, traction, motors, increasing, the, voltage, for, the, traction, motors, reduces, the, current, flowing, through, them, increasing, efficiency, telephone, exchange, communication, equipment, uses, standard, 48, v, dc, power, supply, the, negative, polarity, is, achieved, by, grounding, the, positive, terminal, of, power, supply, system, and, the, battery, bank, this, is, done, to, prevent, electrolysis, depositions, telephone, installations, have, a, battery, system, to, ensure, power, is, maintained, for, subscriber, lines, during, power, interruptions, other, devices, may, be, powered, from, the, telecommunications, dc, system, using, a, dc, dc, converter, to, provide, any, convenient, voltage, many, telephones, connect, to, a, twisted, pair, of, wires, and, use, a, bias, tee, to, internally, separate, the, ac, component, of, the, voltage, between, the, two, wires, the, audio, signal, from, the, dc, component, of, the, voltage, between, the, two, wires, used, to, power, the, phone, high, voltage, direct, current, hvdc, electric, power, transmission, systems, use, dc, for, the, bulk, transmission, of, electrical, power, in, contrast, with, the, more, common, alternating, current, systems, for, long, distance, transmission, hvdc, systems, may, be, less, expensive, and, suffer, lower, electrical, losses, applications, using, fuel, cells, mixing, hydrogen, and, oxygen, together, with, a, catalyst, to, produce, electricity, and, water, as, byproducts, also, produce, only, dc, light, aircraft, electrical, systems, are, typically, 12, v, or, 24, v, dc, similar, to, automobiles
