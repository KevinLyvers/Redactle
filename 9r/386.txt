niobium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, nb, formerly, columbium, cb, and, atomic, number, 41, it, is, a, light, grey, crystalline, and, ductile, transition, metal, pure, niobium, has, a, mohs, hardness, rating, similar, to, pure, titanium, and, it, has, similar, ductility, to, iron, niobium, oxidizes, in, earth, s, atmosphere, very, slowly, hence, its, application, in, jewelry, as, a, hypoallergenic, alternative, to, nickel, niobium, is, often, found, in, the, minerals, pyrochlore, and, columbite, its, name, comes, from, greek, mythology, niobe, daughter, of, tantalus, the, namesake, of, tantalum, the, name, reflects, the, great, similarity, between, the, two, elements, in, their, physical, and, chemical, properties, which, makes, them, difficult, to, distinguish, english, chemist, charles, hatchett, reported, a, new, element, similar, to, tantalum, in, 1801, and, named, it, columbium, in, 1809, english, chemist, william, hyde, wollaston, wrongly, concluded, that, tantalum, and, columbium, were, identical, german, chemist, heinrich, rose, determined, in, 1846, that, tantalum, ores, contain, a, second, element, which, he, named, niobium, in, 1864, and, 1865, a, series, of, scientific, findings, clarified, that, niobium, and, columbium, were, the, same, element, as, distinguished, from, tantalum, and, for, a, century, both, names, were, used, interchangeably, niobium, was, officially, adopted, as, the, name, of, the, element, in, 1949, but, the, name, columbium, remains, in, current, use, in, metallurgy, in, the, united, states, it, was, not, until, the, early, 20th, century, that, niobium, was, first, used, commercially, niobium, is, an, important, addition, to, high, strength, low, alloy, steels, brazil, is, the, leading, producer, of, niobium, and, ferroniobium, an, alloy, of, 60, 70, niobium, with, iron, niobium, is, used, mostly, in, alloys, the, largest, part, in, special, steel, such, as, that, used, in, gas, pipelines, although, these, alloys, contain, a, maximum, of, 0, 1, the, small, percentage, of, niobium, enhances, the, strength, of, the, steel, by, scavenging, carbide, and, nitride, the, temperature, stability, of, niobium, containing, superalloys, is, important, for, its, use, in, jet, and, rocket, engines, niobium, is, used, in, various, superconducting, materials, these, alloys, also, containing, titanium, and, tin, are, widely, used, in, the, superconducting, magnets, of, mri, scanners, other, applications, of, niobium, include, welding, nuclear, industries, electronics, optics, numismatics, and, jewelry, in, the, last, two, applications, the, low, toxicity, and, iridescence, produced, by, anodization, are, highly, desired, properties, niobium, is, considered, a, technology, critical, element, niobium, was, identified, by, english, chemist, charles, hatchett, in, 1801, he, found, a, new, element, in, a, mineral, sample, that, had, been, sent, to, england, from, connecticut, united, states, in, 1734, by, john, winthrop, f, r, s, grandson, of, john, winthrop, the, younger, and, named, the, mineral, columbite, and, the, new, element, columbium, after, columbia, the, poetic, name, for, the, united, states, the, columbium, discovered, by, hatchett, was, probably, a, mixture, of, the, new, element, with, tantalum, subsequently, there, was, considerable, confusion, over, the, difference, between, columbium, niobium, and, the, closely, related, tantalum, in, 1809, english, chemist, william, hyde, wollaston, compared, the, oxides, derived, from, both, columbium, columbite, with, a, density, 5, 918, g, cm, 3, and, tantalum, tantalite, with, a, density, over, 8, g, cm, 3, and, concluded, that, the, two, oxides, despite, the, significant, difference, in, density, were, identical, thus, he, kept, the, name, tantalum, this, conclusion, was, disputed, in, 1846, by, german, chemist, heinrich, rose, who, argued, that, there, were, two, different, elements, in, the, tantalite, sample, and, named, them, after, children, of, tantalus, niobium, from, niobe, and, pelopium, from, pelops, this, confusion, arose, from, the, minimal, observed, differences, between, tantalum, and, niobium, the, claimed, new, elements, pelopium, ilmenium, and, dianium, were, in, fact, identical, to, niobium, or, mixtures, of, niobium, and, tantalum, the, differences, between, tantalum, and, niobium, were, unequivocally, demonstrated, in, 1864, by, christian, wilhelm, blomstrand, and, henri, tienne, sainte, claire, deville, as, well, as, louis, j, troost, who, determined, the, formulas, of, some, of, the, compounds, in, 1865, and, finally, by, swiss, chemist, jean, charles, galissard, de, marignac, in, 1866, who, all, proved, that, there, were, only, two, elements, articles, on, ilmenium, continued, to, appear, until, 1871, de, marignac, was, the, first, to, prepare, the, metal, in, 1864, when, he, reduced, niobium, chloride, by, heating, it, in, an, atmosphere, of, hydrogen, although, de, marignac, was, able, to, produce, tantalum, free, niobium, on, a, larger, scale, by, 1866, it, was, not, until, the, early, 20th, century, that, niobium, was, used, in, incandescent, lamp, filaments, the, first, commercial, application, this, use, quickly, became, obsolete, through, the, replacement, of, niobium, with, tungsten, which, has, a, higher, melting, point, that, niobium, improves, the, strength, of, steel, was, first, discovered, in, the, 1920s, and, this, application, remains, its, predominant, use, in, 1961, the, american, physicist, eugene, kunzler, and, coworkers, at, bell, labs, discovered, that, niobium, tin, continues, to, exhibit, superconductivity, in, the, presence, of, strong, electric, currents, and, magnetic, fields, making, it, the, first, material, to, support, the, high, currents, and, fields, necessary, for, useful, high, power, magnets, and, electrical, power, machinery, this, discovery, enabled, two, decades, later, the, production, of, long, multi, strand, cables, wound, into, coils, to, create, large, powerful, electromagnets, for, rotating, machinery, particle, accelerators, and, particle, detectors, columbium, symbol, cb, was, the, name, originally, given, by, hatchett, upon, his, discovery, of, the, metal, in, 1801, the, name, reflected, that, the, type, specimen, of, the, ore, came, from, the, united, states, of, america, columbia, this, name, remained, in, use, in, american, journals, the, last, paper, published, by, american, chemical, society, with, columbium, in, its, title, dates, from, 1953, while, niobium, was, used, in, europe, to, end, this, confusion, the, name, niobium, was, chosen, for, element, 41, at, the, 15th, conference, of, the, union, of, chemistry, in, amsterdam, in, 1949, a, year, later, this, name, was, officially, adopted, by, the, international, union, of, pure, and, applied, chemistry, iupac, after, 100, years, of, controversy, despite, the, chronological, precedence, of, the, name, columbium, this, was, a, compromise, of, sorts, the, iupac, accepted, tungsten, instead, of, wolfram, in, deference, to, north, american, usage, and, niobium, instead, of, columbium, in, deference, to, european, usage, while, many, us, chemical, societies, and, government, organizations, typically, use, the, official, iupac, name, some, metallurgists, and, metal, societies, still, use, the, original, american, name, columbium, niobium, is, a, lustrous, grey, ductile, paramagnetic, metal, in, group, 5, of, the, periodic, table, see, table, with, an, electron, configuration, in, the, outermost, shells, atypical, for, group, 5, similarly, atypical, configurations, occur, in, the, neighborhood, of, ruthenium, 44, rhodium, 45, and, palladium, 46, although, it, is, thought, to, have, a, body, centered, cubic, crystal, structure, from, absolute, zero, to, its, melting, point, high, resolution, measurements, of, the, thermal, expansion, along, the, three, crystallographic, axes, reveal, anisotropies, which, are, inconsistent, with, a, cubic, structure, therefore, further, research, and, discovery, in, this, area, is, expected, niobium, becomes, a, superconductor, at, cryogenic, temperatures, at, atmospheric, pressure, it, has, the, highest, critical, temperature, of, the, elemental, superconductors, at, 9, 2, k, niobium, has, the, greatest, magnetic, penetration, depth, of, any, element, in, addition, it, is, one, of, the, three, elemental, type, ii, superconductors, along, with, vanadium, and, technetium, the, superconductive, properties, are, strongly, dependent, on, the, purity, of, the, niobium, metal, when, very, pure, it, is, comparatively, soft, and, ductile, but, impurities, make, it, harder, the, metal, has, a, low, capture, cross, section, for, thermal, neutrons, thus, it, is, used, in, the, nuclear, industries, where, neutron, transparent, structures, are, desired, the, metal, takes, on, a, bluish, tinge, when, exposed, to, air, at, room, temperature, for, extended, periods, despite, a, high, melting, point, in, elemental, form, 2, 468, c, it, is, less, dense, than, other, refractory, metals, furthermore, it, is, corrosion, resistant, exhibits, superconductivity, properties, and, forms, dielectric, oxide, layers, niobium, is, slightly, less, electropositive, and, more, compact, than, its, predecessor, in, the, periodic, table, zirconium, whereas, it, is, virtually, identical, in, size, to, the, heavier, tantalum, atoms, as, a, result, of, the, lanthanide, contraction, as, a, result, niobium, s, chemical, properties, are, very, similar, to, those, for, tantalum, which, appears, directly, below, niobium, in, the, periodic, table, although, its, corrosion, resistance, is, not, as, outstanding, as, that, of, tantalum, the, lower, price, and, greater, availability, make, niobium, attractive, for, less, demanding, applications, such, as, vat, linings, in, chemical, plants, niobium, in, earth, s, crust, comprises, almost, totally, of, one, stable, isotope, 93, nb, by, 2003, at, least, 32, radioisotopes, had, been, synthesized, ranging, in, atomic, mass, from, 81, to, 113, the, most, stable,

nonstoichiometric, the, metal, begins, to, oxidize, in, air, at, 200, c, it, resists, corrosion, by, acids, including, aqua, regia, hydrochloric, sulfuric, nitric, and, phosphoric, acids, niobium, is, attacked, by, hot, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, hydrofluoric, acid, and, hydrofluoric, nitric, acid, mixtures, it, is, also, attacked, by, hot, saturated, alkali, metal, hydroxide, solutions, although, niobium, exhibits, all, of, the, formal, oxidation, states, from, 5, to, 1, the, most, common, compounds, have, niobium, in, the, 5, state, characteristically, compounds, in, oxidation, states, less, than, 5, display, nb, nb, bonding, in, aqueous, solutions, niobium, only, exhibits, the, 5, oxidation, state, it, is, also, readily, prone, to, hydrolysis, and, is, barely, soluble, in, dilute, solutions, of, hydrochloric, sulfuric, nitric, and, phosphoric, acids, due, to, the, precipitation, of, hydrous, nb, oxide, nb, v, is, also, slightly, soluble, in, alkaline, media, due, to,

apex, and, are, now, used, in, the, hifi, instrument, on, board, the, herschel, space, observatory, lithium, niobate, which, is, a, ferroelectric, is, used, extensively, in, mobile, telephones, and, optical, modulators, and, for, the, manufacture, of, surface, acoustic, wave, devices, it, belongs, to, the, abo, 3, structure, ferroelectrics, like, lithium, tantalate, and, barium, titanate, niobium, capacitors, are, available, as, alternative, to, tantalum, capacitors, but, tantalum, capacitors, still, predominate, niobium, is, added, to, glass, to, obtain, a, higher, refractive, index, making, possible, thinner, and, lighter, corrective, glasses, niobium, and, some, niobium, alloys, are, physiologically, inert, and, hypoallergenic, for, this, reason, niobium, is, used, in, prosthetics, and, implant, devices, such, as, pacemakers, niobium, treated, with, sodium, hydroxide, forms, a, porous, layer, that, aids, osseointegration, like, titanium, tantalum, and, aluminium, niobium, can, be, heated, and, anodized, reactive, metal, anodization, to, produce, a, wide, array, of, iridescent, colours, for, jewelry, where, its, hypoallergenic, property, is, highly, desirable, niobium, is, used, as, a, precious, metal, in, commemorative, coins, often, with, silver, or, gold, for, example, austria, produced, a, series, of, silver, niobium, euro, coins, starting, in, 2003, the, colour, in, these, coins, is, created, by, the, diffraction, of, light, by, a, thin, anodized, oxide, layer, in, 2012, ten, coins, are, available, showing, a, broad, variety, of, colours, in, the, centre, of, the, coin, blue, green, brown, purple, violet, or, yellow, two, more, examples, are, the, 2004, austrian, 25, 150, year, semmering, alpine, railway, commemorative, coin, and, the, 2006, austrian, 25, european, satellite, navigation, commemorative, coin, the, austrian, mint, produced, for, latvia, a, similar, series, of, coins, starting, in, 2004, with, one, following, in, 2007, in, 2011, the, royal, canadian, mint, started, production, of, a, 5, sterling, silver, and, niobium, coin, named, hunter, s, moon, in, which, the, niobium, was, selectively, oxidized, thus, creating, unique, finishes, where, no, two, coins, are, exactly, alike, the, arc, tube, seals, of, high, pressure, sodium, vapor, lamps, are, made, from, niobium, sometimes, alloyed, with, 1, of, zirconium, niobium, has, a, very, similar, coefficient, of, thermal, expansion, matching, the, sintered, alumina, arc, tube, ceramic, a, translucent, material, which, resists, chemical, attack, or, reduction, by, the, hot, liquid, sodium, and, sodium, vapour, contained, inside, the, operating, lamp, niobium, is, used, in, arc, welding, rods, for, some, stabilized, grades, of, stainless, steel, and, in, anodes, for, cathodic, protection, systems, on, some, water, tanks, which, are, then, usually, plated, with, platinum, niobium, is, used, to, make, the, high, voltage, wire, of, the, solar, corona, particles, receptor, module, of, the, parker, solar, probe, niobium, is, a, constituent, of, a, lightfast, chemically, stable, inorganic, yellow, pigment, that, has, the, trade, name, ntp, yellow, it, is, niobium, sulfur, tin, zinc, oxide, a, pyrochlore, produced, via, high, temperature, calcination, the, pigment, is, also, known, as, pigment, yellow, 227, commonly, listed, as, py, 227, or, py227,
