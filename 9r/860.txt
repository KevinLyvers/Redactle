https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model
the, rgb, color, model, is, an, additive, color, model, in, which, the, red, green, and, blue, primary, colors, of, light, are, added, together, in, various, ways, to, reproduce, a, broad, array, of, colors, the, name, of, the, model, comes, from, the, initials, of, the, three, additive, primary, colors, red, green, and, blue, the, main, purpose, of, the, rgb, color, model, is, for, the, sensing, representation, and, display, of, images, in, electronic, systems, such, as, televisions, and, computers, though, it, has, also, been, used, in, conventional, photography, and, colored, lighting, before, the, electronic, age, the, rgb, color, model, already, had, a, solid, theory, behind, it, based, in, human, perception, of, colors, rgb, is, a, device, dependent, color, model, different, devices, detect, or, reproduce, a, given, rgb, value, differently, since, the, color, elements, such, as, phosphors, or, dyes, and, their, response, to, the, individual, red, green, and, blue, levels, vary, from, manufacturer, to, manufacturer, or, even, in, the, same, device, over, time, thus, an, rgb, value, does, not, define, the, same, color, across, devices, without, some, kind, of, color, management, typical, rgb, input, devices, are, color, tv, and, video, cameras, image, scanners, and, digital, cameras, typical, rgb, output, devices, are, tv, sets, of, various, technologies, crt, lcd, plasma, oled, quantum, dots, etc, computer, and, mobile, phone, displays, video, projectors, multicolor, led, displays, and, large, screens, such, as, the, jumbotron, color, printers, on, the, other, hand, are, not, rgb, devices, but, subtractive, color, devices, typically, using, the, cmyk, color, model, to, form, a, color, with, rgb, three, light, beams, one, red, one, green, and, one, blue, must, be, superimposed, for, example, by, emission, from, a, black, screen, or, by, reflection, from, a, white, screen, each, of, the, three, beams, is, called, a, component, of, that, color, and, each, of, them, can, have, an, arbitrary, intensity, from, fully, off, to, fully, on, in, the, mixture, the, rgb, color, model, is, additive, in, the, sense, that, if, light, beams, of, differing, color, frequency, are, superposed, in, space, their, light, spectra, adds, up, wavelength, for, wavelength, to, make, up, a, resulting, total, spectrum, this, is, essentially, opposite, to, the, subtractive, color, model, particularly, the, cmy, color, model, which, applies, to, paints, inks, dyes, and, other, substances, whose, color, depends, on, reflecting, certain, components, frequencies, of, the, light, under, which, we, see, them, in, the, additive, model, if, the, resulting, spectrum, e, g, of, superposing, three, colors, is, flat, white, color, is, perceived, by, the, human, eye, upon, direct, incidence, on, the, retina, this, is, in, stark, contrast, to, the, subtractive, model, where, the, perceived, resulting, spectrum, is, what, reflecting, surfaces, such, as, dyed, surfaces, emit, a, dye, filters, out, all, colors, but, its, own, two, blended, dyes, filter, out, all, colors, but, the, common, color, component, between, them, e, g, green, as, the, common, component, between, yellow, and, cyan, red, as, the, common, component, between, magenta, and, yellow, and, blue, violet, as, the, common, component, between, magenta, and, cyan, there, is, no, color, component, among, magenta, cyan, and, yellow, thus, rendering, a, spectrum, of, zero, intensity, black, zero, intensity, for, each, component, gives, the, darkest, color, no, light, considered, the, black, and, full, intensity, of, each, gives, a, white, the, quality, of, this, white, depends, on, the, nature, of, the, primary, light, sources, but, if, they, are, properly, balanced, the, result, is, a, neutral, white, matching, the, system, s, white, point, when, the, intensities, for, all, the, components, are, the, same, the, result, is, a, shade, of, gray, darker, or, lighter, depending, on, the, intensity, when, the, intensities, are, different, the, result, is, a, colorized, hue, more, or, less, saturated, depending, on, the, difference, of, the, strongest, and, weakest, of, the, intensities, of, the, primary, colors, employed, when, one, of, the, components, has, the, strongest, intensity, the, color, is, a, hue, near, this, primary, color, red, ish, green, ish, or, blue, ish, and, when, two, components, have, the, same, strongest, intensity, then, the, color, is, a, hue, of, a, secondary, color, a, shade, of, cyan, magenta, or, yellow, a, secondary, color, is, formed, by, the, sum, of, two, primary, colors, of, equal, intensity, cyan, is, green, blue, magenta, is, blue, red, and, yellow, is, red, green, every, secondary, color, is, the, complement, of, one, primary, color, cyan, complements, red, magenta, complements, green, and, yellow, complements, blue, when, all, the, primary, colors, are, mixed, in, equal, intensities, the, result, is, white, the, rgb, color, model, itself, does, not, define, what, is, meant, by, red, green, and, blue, colorimetrically, and, so, the, results, of, mixing, them, are, not, specified, as, absolute, but, relative, to, the, primary, colors, when, the, exact, chromaticities, of, the, red, green, and, blue, primaries, are, defined, the, color, model, then, becomes, an, absolute, color, space, such, as, srgb, or, adobe, rgb, the, choice, of, primary, colors, is, related, to, the, physiology, of, the, human, eye, good, primaries, are, stimuli, that, maximize, the, difference, between, the, responses, of, the, cone, cells, of, the, human, retina, to, light, of, different, wavelengths, and, that, thereby, make, a, large, color, triangle, the, normal, three, kinds, of, light, sensitive, photoreceptor, cells, in, the, human, eye, cone, cells, respond, most, to, yellow, long, wavelength, or, l, green, medium, or, m, and, violet, short, or, s, light, peak, wavelengths, near, 570, nm, 540, nm, and, 440, nm, respectively, the, difference, in, the, signals, received, from, the, three, kinds, allows, the, brain, to, differentiate, a, wide, gamut, of, different, colors, while, being, most, sensitive, overall, to, yellowish, green, light, and, to, differences, between, hues, in, the, green, to, orange, region, as, an, example, suppose, that, light, in, the, orange, range, of, wavelengths, approximately, 577, nm, to, 597, nm, enters, the, eye, and, strikes, the, retina, light, of, these, wavelengths, would, activate, both, the, medium, and, long, wavelength, cones, of, the, retina, but, not, equally, the, long, wavelength, cells, will, respond, more, the, difference, in, the, response, can, be, detected, by, the, brain, and, this, difference, is, the, basis, of, our, perception, of, orange, thus, the, orange, appearance, of, an, object, results, from, light, from, the, object, entering, our, eye, and, stimulating, the, different, cones, simultaneously, but, to, different, degrees, use, of, the, three, primary, colors, is, not, sufficient, to, reproduce, all, colors, only, colors, within, the, color, triangle, defined, by, the, chromaticities, of, the, primaries, can, be, reproduced, by, additive, mixing, of, non, negative, amounts, of, those, colors, of, light, the, rgb, color, model, is, based, on, the, young, helmholtz, theory, of, trichromatic, color, vision, developed, by, thomas, young, and, hermann, von, helmholtz, in, the, early, to, mid, nineteenth, century, and, on, james, clerk, maxwell, s, color, triangle, that, elaborated, that, theory, c, 1860, the, first, experiments, with, rgb, in, early, color, photography, were, made, in, 1861, by, maxwell, himself, and, involved, the, process, of, combining, three, color, filtered, separate, takes, to, reproduce, the, color, photograph, three, matching, projections, over, a, screen, in, a, dark, room, were, necessary, the, additive, rgb, model, and, variants, such, as, orange, green, violet, were, also, used, in, the, autochrome, lumi, re, color, plates, and, other, screen, plate, technologies, such, as, the, joly, color, screen, and, the, paget, process, in, the, early, twentieth, century, color, photography, by, taking, three, separate, plates, was, used, by, other, pioneers, such, as, the, russian, sergey, prokudin, gorsky, in, the, period, 1909, through, 1915, such, methods, lasted, until, about, 1960, using, the, expensive, and, extremely, complex, tri, color, carbro, autotype, process, when, employed, the, reproduction, of, prints, from, three, plate, photos, was, done, by, dyes, or, pigments, using, the, complementary, cmy, model, by, simply, using, the, negative, plates, of, the, filtered, takes, reverse, red, gives, the, cyan, plate, and, so, on, before, the, development, of, practical, electronic, tv, there, were, patents, on, mechanically, scanned, color, systems, as, early, as, 1889, in, russia, the, color, tv, pioneer, john, logie, baird, demonstrated, the, world, s, first, rgb, color, transmission, in, 1928, and, also, the, world, s, first, color, broadcast, in, 1938, in, london, in, his, experiments, scanning, and, display, were, done, mechanically, by, spinning, colorized, wheels, the, columbia, broadcasting, system, cbs, began, an, experimental, rgb, field, sequential, color, system, in, 1940, images, were, scanned, electrically, but, the, system, still, used, a, moving, part, the, transparent, rgb, color, wheel, rotating, at, above, 1, 200, rpm, in, synchronism, with, the, vertical, scan, the, camera, and, the, cathode, ray, tube, crt, were, both, monochromatic, color, was, provided, by, color, wheels, in, the, camera, and, the, receiver, more, recently, color, wheels, have, been, used, in, field, sequential, projection, tv, receivers, based, on, the, texas, instruments, monochrome, dlp, imager, the, modern, rgb, shadow, mask, technology, for, color, crt, displays, was, patented, by, werner, flechsig, in, germany, in, 1938, personal, computers, of, the, late, 1970s, and, early, 1980s, such, as, the, apple, ii, and, vic, 20, use, composite, video, the, commodore, 64, and, the, atari, 8, bit, computers, use, s, video, derivatives, ibm, introduced, a, 16, color, scheme, four, bits, one, bit, each, for, red, green, blue, and, intensity, with, the, color, graphics, adapter, cga, for, its, ibm, pc, in, 1981, later, improved, with, the, enhanced, graphics, adapter, ega, in, 1984, the, first, manufacturer, of, a, truecolor, graphics, card, for, pcs, the, targa, was, truevision, in, 1987, but, it, was, not, until, the, arrival, of, the, video, graphics, array, vga, in, 1987, that, rgb, became, popular, mainly, due, to, the, analog, signals, in, the, connection, between, the, adapter, and, the, monitor, which, allowed, a, very, wide, range, of, rgb, colors, actually, it, had, to, wait, a, few, more, years, because, the, original, vga, cards, were, palette, driven, just, like, ega, although, with, more, freedom, than, vga, but, because, the, vga, connectors, were, analog, later, variants, of, vga, made, by, various, manufacturers, under, the, informal, name, super, vga, eventually, added, true, color, in, 1992, magazines, heavily, advertised, true, color, super, vga, hardware, one, common, application, of, the, rgb, color, model, is, the, display, of, colors, on, a, cathode, ray, tube, crt, liquid, crystal, display, lcd, plasma, display, or, organic, light, emitting, diode, oled, display, such, as, a, television, a, computer, s, monitor, or, a, large, scale, screen, each, pixel, on, the, screen, is, built, by, driving, three, small, and, very, close, but, still, separated, rgb, light, sources, at, common, viewing, distance, the, separate, sources, are, indistinguishable, which, the, eye, interprets, as, a, given, solid, color, all, the, pixels, together, arranged, in, the, rectangular, screen, surface, conforms, the, color, image, during, digital, image, processing, each, pixel, can, be, represented, in, the, computer, memory, or, interface, hardware, for, example, a, graphics, card, as, binary, values, for, the, red, green, and, blue, color, components, when, properly, managed, these, values, are, converted, into, intensities, or, voltages, via, gamma, correction, to, correct, the, inherent, nonlinearity, of, some, devices, such, that, the, intended, intensities, are, reproduced, on, the, display, the, quattron, released, by, sharp, uses, rgb, color, and, adds, yellow, as, a, sub, pixel, supposedly, allowing, an, increase, in, the, number, of, available, colors, rgb, is, also, the, term, referring, to, a, type, of, component, video, signal, used, in, the, video, electronics, industry, it, consists, of, three, signals, red, green, and, blue, carried, on, three, separate, cables, pins, rgb, signal, formats, are, often, based, on, modified, versions, of, the, rs, 170, and, rs, 343, standards, for, monochrome, video, this, type, of, video, signal, is, widely, used, in, europe, since, it, is, the, best, quality, signal, that, can, be, carried, on, the, standard, scart, connector, this, signal, is, known, as, rgbs, 4, bnc, rca, terminated, cables, exist, as, well, but, it, is, directly, compatible, with, rgbhv, used, for, computer, monitors, usually, carried, on, 15, pin, cables, terminated, with, 15, pin, d, sub, or, 5, bnc, connectors, which, carries, separate, horizontal, and, vertical, sync, signals, outside, europe, rgb, is, not, very, popular, as, a, video, signal, format, s, video, takes, that, spot, in, most, non, european, regions, however, almost, all, computer, monitors, around, the, world, use, rgb, a, framebuffer, is, a, digital, device, for, computers, which, stores, data, in, the, so, called, video, memory, comprising, an, array, of, video, ram, or, similar, chips, this, data, goes, either, to, three, digital, to, analog, converters, dacs, for, analog, monitors, one, per, primary, color, or, directly, to, digital, monitors, driven, by, software, the, cpu, or, other, specialized, chips, write, the, appropriate, bytes, into, the, video, memory, to, define, the, image, modern, systems, encode, pixel, color, values, by, devoting, eight, bits, to, each, of, the, r, g, and, b, components, rgb, information, can, be, either, carried, directly, by, the, pixel, bits, themselves, or, provided, by, a, separate, color, look, up, table, clut, if, indexed, color, graphic, modes, are, used, a, clut, is, a, specialized, ram, that, stores, r, g, and, b, values, that, define, specific, colors, each, color, has, its, own, address, index, consider, it, as, a, descriptive, reference, number, that, provides, that, specific, color, when, the, image, needs, it, the, content, of, the, clut, is, much, like, a, palette, of, colors, image, data, that, uses, indexed, color, specifies, addresses, within, the, clut, to, provide, the, required, r, g, and, b, values, for, each, specific, pixel, one, pixel, at, a, time, of, course, before, displaying, the, clut, has, to, be, loaded, with, r, g, and, b, values, that, define, the, palette, of, colors, required, for, each, image, to, be, rendered, some, video, applications, store, such, palettes, in, pal, files, age, of, empires, game, for, example, uses, over, half, a, dozen, and, can, combine, cluts, on, screen, this, indirect, scheme, restricts, the, number, of, available, colors, in, an, image, clut, typically, 256, cubed, 8, bits, in, three, color, channels, with, values, of, 0, 255, although, each, color, in, the, rgb24, clut, table, has, only, 8, bits, representing, 256, codes, for, each, of, the, r, g, and, b, primaries, making, 16, 777, 216, possible, colors, however, the, advantage, is, that, an, indexed, color, image, file, can, be, significantly, smaller, than, it, would, be, with, only, 8, bits, per, pixel, for, each, primary, modern, storage, however, is, far, less, costly, greatly, reducing, the, need, to, minimize, image, file, size, by, using, an, appropriate, combination, of, red, green, and, blue, intensities, many, colors, can, be, displayed, current, typical, display, adapters, use, up, to, 24, bits, of, information, for, each, pixel, 8, bit, per, component, multiplied, by, three, components, see, the, numeric, representations, section, below, 24bits, 256, 3, each, primary, value, of, 8, bits, with, values, of, 0, 255, with, this, system, 16, 777, 216, 256, 3, or, 2, 24, discrete, combinations, of, r, g, and, b, values, are, allowed, providing, millions, of, different, though, not, necessarily, distinguishable, hue, saturation, and, lightness, shades, increased, shading, has, been, implemented, in, various, ways, some, formats, such, as, png, and, tga, files, among, others, using, a, fourth, greyscale, color, channel, as, a, masking, layer, often, called, rgb32, for, images, with, a, modest, range, of, brightnesses, from, the, darkest, to, the, lightest, eight, bits, per, primary, color, provides, good, quality, images, but, extreme, images, require, more, bits, per, primary, color, as, well, as, the, advanced, display, technology, for, more, information, see, high, dynamic, range, hdr, imaging, in, classic, crt, devices, the, brightness, of, a, given, point, over, the, fluorescent, screen, due, to, the, impact, of, accelerated, electrons, is, not, proportional, to, the, voltages, applied, to, the, electron, gun, control, grids, but, to, an, expansive, function, of, that, voltage, the, amount, of, this, deviation, is, known, as, its, gamma, value, displaystyle, gamma, the, argument, for, a, power, law, function, which, closely, describes, this, behavior, a, linear, response, is, given, by, a, gamma, value, of, 1, 0, but, actual, crt, nonlinearities, have, a, gamma, value, around, 2, 0, to, 2, 5, similarly, the, intensity, of, the, output, on, tv, and, computer, display, devices, is, not, directly, proportional, to, the, r, g, and, b, applied, electric, signals, or, file, data, values, which, drive, them, through, digital, to, analog, converters, on, a, typical, standard, 2, 2, gamma, crt, display, an, input, intensity, rgb, value, of, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, only, outputs, about, 22, of, full, brightness, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, instead, of, 50, to, obtain, the, correct, response, a, gamma, correction, is, used, in, encoding, the, image, data, and, possibly, further, corrections, as, part, of, the, color, calibration, process, of, the, device, gamma, affects, black, and, white, tv, as, well, as, color, in, standard, color, tv, broadcast, signals, are, gamma, corrected, in, color, television, and, video, cameras, manufactured, before, the, 1990s, the, incoming, light, was, separated, by, prisms, and, filters, into, the, three, rgb, primary, colors, feeding, each, color, into, a, separate, video, camera, tube, or, pickup, tube, these, tubes, are, a, type, of, cathode, ray, tube, not, to, be, confused, with, that, of, crt, displays, with, the, arrival, of, commercially, viable, charge, coupled, device, ccd, technology, in, the, 1980s, first, the, pickup, tubes, were, replaced, with, this, kind, of, sensor, later, higher, scale, integration, electronics, was, applied, mainly, by, sony, simplifying, and, even, removing, the, intermediate, optics, thereby, reducing, the, size, of, home, video, cameras, and, eventually, leading, to, the, development, of, full, camcorders, current, webcams, and, mobile, phones, with, cameras, are, the, most, miniaturized, commercial, forms, of, such, technology, photographic, digital, cameras, that, use, a, cmos, or, ccd, image, sensor, often, operate, with, some, variation, of, the, rgb, model, in, a, bayer, filter, arrangement, green, is, given, twice, as, many, detectors, as, red, and, blue, ratio, 1, 2, 1, in, order, to, achieve, higher, luminance, resolution, than, chrominance, resolution, the, sensor, has, a, grid, of, red, green, and, blue, detectors, arranged, so, that, the, first, row, is, rgrgrgrg, the, next, is, gbgbgbgb, and, that, sequence, is, repeated, in, subsequent, rows, for, every, channel, missing, pixels, are, obtained, by, interpolation, in, the, demosaicing, process, to, build, up, the, complete, image, also, other, processes, used, to, be, applied, in, order, to, map, the, camera, rgb, measurements, into, a, standard, color, space, as, srgb, in, computing, an, image, scanner, is, a, device, that, optically, scans, images, printed, text, handwriting, or, an, object, and, converts, it, to, a, digital, image, which, is, transferred, to, a, computer, among, other, formats, flat, drum, and, film, scanners, exist, and, most, of, them, support, rgb, color, they, can, be, considered, the, successors, of, early, telephotography, input, devices, which, were, able, to, send, consecutive, scan, lines, as, analog, amplitude, modulation, signals, through, standard, telephonic, lines, to, appropriate, receivers, such, systems, were, in, use, in, press, since, the, 1920s, to, the, mid, 1990s, color, telephotographs, were, sent, as, three, separated, rgb, filtered, images, consecutively, currently, available, scanners, typically, use, ccd, or, contact, image, sensor, cis, as, the, image, sensor, whereas, older, drum, scanners, use, a, photomultiplier, tube, as, the, image, sensor, early, color, film, scanners, used, a, halogen, lamp, and, a, three, color, filter, wheel, so, three, exposures, were, needed, to, scan, a, single, color, image, due, to, heating, problems, the, worst, of, them, being, the, potential, destruction, of, the, scanned, film, this, technology, was, later, replaced, by, non, heating, light, sources, such, as, color, leds, a, color, in, the, rgb, color, model, is, described, by, indicating, how, much, of, each, of, the, red, green, and, blue, is, included, the, color, is, expressed, as, an, rgb, triplet, r, g, b, each, component, of, which, can, vary, from, zero, to, a, defined, maximum, value, if, all, the, components, are, at, zero, the, result, is, black, if, all, are, at, maximum, the, result, is, the, brightest, representable, white, these, ranges, may, be, quantified, in, several, different, ways, for, example, brightest, saturated, red, is, written, in, the, different, rgb, notations, as, in, many, environments, the, component, values, within, the, ranges, are, not, managed, as, linear, that, is, the, numbers, are, nonlinearly, related, to, the, intensities, that, they, represent, as, in, digital, cameras, and, tv, broadcasting, and, receiving, due, to, gamma, correction, for, example, linear, and, nonlinear, transformations, are, often, dealt, with, via, digital, image, processing, representations, with, only, 8, bits, per, component, are, considered, sufficient, if, gamma, correction, is, used, following, is, the, mathematical, relationship, between, rgb, space, to, hsi, space, hue, saturation, and, intensity, hsi,

the, rgb, color, model, is, one, of, the, most, common, ways, to, encode, color, in, computing, and, several, different, digital, representations, are, in, use, the, main, characteristic, of, all, of, them, is, the, quantization, of, the, possible, values, per, component, technically, a, sample, by, using, only, integer, numbers, within, some, range, usually, from, 0, to, some, power, of, two, minus, one, 2, n, 1, to, fit, them, into, some, bit, groupings, encodings, of, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, and, 16, bits, per, color, are, commonly, found, the, total, number, of, bits, used, for, an, rgb, color, is, typically, called, the, color, depth, since, colors, are, usually, defined, by, three, components, not, only, in, the, rgb, model, but, also, in, other, color, models, such, as, cielab, and, y, uv, among, others, then, a, three, dimensional, volume, is, described, by, treating, the, component, values, as, ordinary, cartesian, coordinates, in, a, euclidean, space, for, the, rgb, model, this, is, represented, by, a, cube, using, non, negative, values, within, a, 0, 1, range, assigning, black, to, the, origin, at, the, vertex, 0, 0, 0, and, with, increasing, intensity, values, running, along, the, three, axes, up, to, white, at, the, vertex, 1, 1, 1, diagonally, opposite, black, an, rgb, triplet, r, g, b, represents, the, three, dimensional, coordinate, of, the, point, of, the, given, color, within, the, cube, or, its, faces, or, along, its, edges, this, approach, allows, computations, of, the, color, similarity, of, two, given, rgb, colors, by, simply, calculating, the, distance, between, them, the, shorter, the, distance, the, higher, the, similarity, out, of, gamut, computations, can, also, be, performed, this, way, initially, the, limited, color, depth, of, most, video, hardware, led, to, a, limited, color, palette, of, 216, rgb, colors, defined, by, the, netscape, color, cube, the, web, safe, color, palette, consists, of, the, 216, 6, 3, combinations, of, red, green, and, blue, where, each, color, can, take, one, of, six, values, in, hexadecimal, 00, 33, 66, 99, cc, or, ff, based, on, the, 0, to, 255, range, for, each, value, discussed, above, these, hexadecimal, values, 0, 51, 102, 153, 204, 255, in, decimal, which, 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, in, terms, of, intensity, this, seems, fine, for, splitting, up, 216, colors, into, a, cube, of, dimension, 6, however, lacking, gamma, correction, the, perceived, intensity, on, a, standard, 2, 5, gamma, crt, lcd, is, only, 0, 2, 10, 28, 57, 100, see, the, actual, web, safe, color, palette, for, a, visual, confirmation, that, the, majority, of, the, colors, produced, are, very, dark, with, the, predominance, of, 24, bit, displays, the, use, of, the, full, 16, 7, million, colors, of, the, html, rgb, color, code, no, longer, poses, problems, for, most, viewers, the, srgb, color, space, a, device, independent, color, space, for, html, was, formally, adopted, as, an, internet, standard, in, html, 3, 2, though, it, had, been, in, use, for, some, time, before, that, all, images, and, colors, are, interpreted, as, being, srgb, unless, another, color, space, is, specified, and, all, modern, displays, can, display, this, color, space, with, color, management, being, built, in, into, browsers, or, operating, systems, the, syntax, in, css, is, where, equals, the, proportion, of, red, green, and, blue, respectively, this, syntax, can, be, used, after, such, selectors, as, background, color, or, for, text, color, wide, gamut, color, is, possible, in, modern, css, being, supported, by, all, major, browsers, since, 2023, for, example, a, color, on, the, dci, p3, color, space, can, be, indicated, as, where, equals, the, proportion, of, red, green, and, blue, in, 0, 0, to, 1, 0, respectively, proper, reproduction, of, colors, especially, in, professional, environments, requires, color, management, of, all, the, devices, involved, in, the, production, process, many, of, them, using, rgb, color, management, results, in, several, transparent, conversions, between, device, independent, srgb, xyz, l, a, b, and, device, dependent, color, spaces, rgb, and, others, as, cmyk, for, color, printing, during, a, typical, production, cycle, in, order, to, ensure, color, consistency, throughout, the, process, along, with, the, creative, processing, such, interventions, on, digital, images, can, damage, the, color, accuracy, and, image, detail, especially, where, the, gamut, is, reduced, professional, digital, devices, and, software, tools, allow, for, 48, bpp, bits, per, pixel, images, to, be, manipulated, 16, bits, per, channel, to, minimize, any, such, damage, icc, profile, compliant, applications, such, as, adobe, photoshop, use, either, the, lab, color, space, or, the, cie, 1931, color, space, as, a, profile, connection, space, when, translating, between, color, spaces, all, luminance, chrominance, formats, used, in, the, different, tv, and, video, standards, such, as, yiq, for, ntsc, yuv, for, pal, yd, b, d, r, for, secam, and, yp, b, p, r, for, component, video, use, color, difference, signals, by, which, rgb, color, images, can, be, encoded, for, broadcasting, recording, and, later, decoded, into, rgb, again, to, display, them, these, intermediate, formats, were, needed, for, compatibility, with, pre, existent, black, and, white, tv, formats, also, those, color, difference, signals, need, lower, data, bandwidth, compared, to, full, rgb, signals, similarly, current, high, efficiency, digital, color, image, data, compression, schemes, such, as, jpeg, and, mpeg, store, rgb, color, internally, in, yc, b, c, r, format, a, digital, luminance, chrominance, format, based, on, yp, b, p, r, the, use, of, yc, b, c, r, also, allows, computers, to, perform, lossy, subsampling, with, the, chrominance, channels, typically, to, 4, 2, 2, or, 4, 1, 1, ratios, which, reduces, the, resultant, file, size
