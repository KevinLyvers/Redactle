mineralogy, is, a, subject, of, geology, specializing, in, the, scientific, study, of, the, chemistry, crystal, structure, and, physical, including, optical, properties, of, minerals, and, mineralized, artifacts, specific, studies, within, mineralogy, include, the, processes, of, mineral, origin, and, formation, classification, of, minerals, their, geographical, distribution, as, well, as, their, utilization, early, writing, on, mineralogy, especially, on, gemstones, comes, from, ancient, babylonia, the, ancient, greco, roman, world, ancient, and, medieval, china, and, sanskrit, texts, from, ancient, india, and, the, ancient, islamic, world, books, on, the, subject, included, the, natural, history, of, pliny, the, elder, which, not, only, described, many, different, minerals, but, also, explained, many, of, their, properties, and, kitab, al, jawahir, book, of, precious, stones, by, persian, scientist, al, biruni, the, german, renaissance, specialist, georgius, agricola, wrote, works, such, as, de, re, metallica, on, metals, 1556, and, de, natura, fossilium, on, the, nature, of, rocks, 1546, which, began, the, scientific, approach, to, the, subject, systematic, scientific, studies, of, minerals, and, rocks, developed, in, post, renaissance, europe, the, modern, study, of, mineralogy, was, founded, on, the, principles, of, crystallography, the, origins, of, geometric, crystallography, itself, can, be, traced, back, to, the, mineralogy, practiced, in, the, eighteenth, and, nineteenth, centuries, and, to, the, microscopic, study, of, rock, sections, with, the, invention, of, the, microscope, in, the, 17th, century, nicholas, steno, first, observed, the, law, of, constancy, of, interfacial, angles, also, known, as, the, first, law, of, crystallography, in, quartz, crystals, in, 1669, 4, this, was, later, generalized, and, established, experimentally, by, jean, baptiste, l, rom, de, l, islee, in, 1783, ren, just, ha, y, the, father, of, modern, crystallography, showed, that, crystals, are, periodic, and, established, that, the, orientations, of, crystal, faces, can, be, expressed, in, terms, of, rational, numbers, as, later, encoded, in, the, miller, indices, 4, in, 1814, j, ns, jacob, berzelius, introduced, a, classification, of, minerals, based, on, their, chemistry, rather, than, their, crystal, structure, william, nicol, developed, the, nicol, prism, which, polarizes, light, in, 1827, 1828, while, studying, fossilized, wood, henry, clifton, sorby, showed, that, thin, sections, of, minerals, could, be, identified, by, their, optical, properties, using, a, polarizing, microscope, 4, 15, james, d, dana, published, his, first, edition, of, a, system, of, mineralogy, in, 1837, and, in, a, later, edition, introduced, a, chemical, classification, that, is, still, the, standard, 4, 15, x, ray, diffraction, was, demonstrated, by, max, von, laue, in, 1912, and, developed, into, a, tool, for, analyzing, the, crystal, structure, of, minerals, by, the, father, son, team, of, william, henry, bragg, and, william, lawrence, bragg, 4, more, recently, driven, by, advances, in, experimental, technique, such, as, neutron, diffraction, and, available, computational, power, the, latter, of, which, has, enabled, extremely, accurate, atomic, scale, simulations, of, the, behaviour, of, crystals, the, science, has, branched, out, to, consider, more, general, problems, in, the, fields, of, inorganic, chemistry, and, solid, state, physics, it, however, retains, a, focus, on, the, crystal, structures, commonly, encountered, in, rock, forming, minerals, such, as, the, perovskites, clay, minerals, and, framework, silicates, in, particular, the, field, has, made, great, advances, in, the, understanding, of, the, relationship, between, the, atomic, scale, structure, of, minerals, and, their, function, in, nature, prominent, examples, would, be, accurate, measurement, and, prediction, of, the, elastic, properties, of, minerals, which, has, led, to, new, insight, into, seismological, behaviour, of, rocks, and, depth, related, discontinuities, in, seismograms, of, the, earth, s, mantle, to, this, end, in, their, focus, on, the, connection, between, atomic, scale, phenomena, and, macroscopic, properties, the, mineral, sciences, as, they, are, now, commonly, known, display, perhaps, more, of, an, overlap, with, materials, science, than, any, other, discipline, an, initial, step, in, identifying, a, mineral, is, to, examine, its, physical, properties, many, of, which, can, be, measured, on, a, hand, sample, these, can, be, classified, into, density, often, given, as, specific, gravity, measures, of, mechanical, cohesion, hardness, tenacity, cleavage, fracture, parting, macroscopic, visual, properties, luster, color, streak, luminescence, diaphaneity, magnetic, and, electric, properties, radioactivity, and, solubility, in, hydrogen, chloride, h, cl, 97, 113, 39, 53, hardness, is, determined, by, comparison, with, other, minerals, in, the, mohs, scale, a, standard, set, of, minerals, are, numbered, in, order, of, increasing, hardness, from, 1, talc, to, 10, diamond, a, harder, mineral, will, scratch, a, softer, so, an, unknown, mineral, can, be, placed, in, this, scale, by, which, minerals, it, scratches, and, which, scratch, it, a, few, minerals, such, as, calcite, and, kyanite, have, a, hardness, that, depends, significantly, on, direction, 254, 255, hardness, can, also, be, measured, on, an, absolute, scale, using, a, sclerometer, compared, to, the, absolute, scale, the, mohs, scale, is, nonlinear, 52, tenacity, refers, to, the, way, a, mineral, behaves, when, it, is, broken, crushed, bent, or, torn, a, mineral, can, be, brittle, malleable, sectile, ductile, flexible, or, elastic, an, important, influence, on, tenacity, is, the, type, of, chemical, bond, e, g, ionic, or, metallic, 255, 256, of, the, other, measures, of, mechanical, cohesion, cleavage, is, the, tendency, to, break, along, certain, crystallographic, planes, it, is, described, by, the, quality, e, g, perfect, or, fair, and, the, orientation, of, the, plane, in, crystallographic, nomenclature, parting, is, the, tendency, to, break, along, planes, of, weakness, due, to, pressure, twinning, or, exsolution, where, these, two, kinds, of, break, do, not, occur, fracture, is, a, less, orderly, form, that, may, be, conchoidal, having, smooth, curves, resembling, the, interior, of, a, shell, fibrous, splintery, hackly, jagged, with, sharp, edges, or, uneven, 253, 254, if, the, mineral, is, well, crystallized, it, will, also, have, a, distinctive, crystal, habit, for, example, hexagonal, columnar, botryoidal, that, reflects, the, crystal, structure, or, internal, arrangement, of, atoms, 40, 41, it, is, also, affected, by, crystal, defects, and, twinning, many, crystals, are, polymorphic, having, more, than, one, possible, crystal, structure, depending, on, factors, such, as, pressure, and, temperature, 66, 68, 126, the, crystal, structure, is, the, arrangement, of, atoms, in, a, crystal, it, is, represented, by, a, lattice, of, points, which, repeats, a, basic, pattern, called, a, unit, cell, in, three, dimensions, the, lattice, can, be, characterized, by, its, symmetries, and, by, the, dimensions, of, the, unit, cell, these, dimensions, are, represented, by, three, miller, indices, 91, 92, the, lattice, remains, unchanged, by, certain, symmetry, operations, about, any, given, point, in, the, lattice, reflection, rotation, inversion, and, rotary, inversion, a, combination, of, rotation, and, reflection, together, they, make, up, a, mathematical, object, called, a, crystallographic, point, group, or, crystal, class, there, are, 32, possible, crystal, classes, in, addition, there, are, operations, that, displace, all, the, points, translation, screw, axis, and, glide, plane, in, combination, with, the, point, symmetries, they, form, 230, possible, space, groups, 125, 126, most, geology, departments, have, x, ray, powder, diffraction, equipment, to, analyze, the, crystal, structures, of, minerals, 54, 55, x, rays, have, wavelengths, that, are, the, same, order, of, magnitude, as, the, distances, between, atoms, diffraction, the, constructive, and, destructive, interference, between, waves, scattered, at, different, atoms, leads, to, distinctive, patterns, of, high, and, low, intensity, that, depend, on, the, geometry, of, the, crystal, in, a, sample, that, is, ground, to, a, powder, the, x, rays, sample, a, random, distribution, of, all, crystal, orientations, powder, diffraction, can, distinguish, between, minerals, that, may, appear, the, same, in, a, hand, sample, for, example, quartz, and, its, polymorphs, tridymite, and, cristobalite, 54, isomorphous, minerals, of, different, compositions, have, similar, powder, diffraction, patterns, the, main, difference, being, in, spacing, and, intensity, of, lines, for, example, the, na, cl, halite, crystal, structure, is, space, group, fm3m, this, structure, is, shared, by, sylvite, k, cl, periclase, mg, o, bunsenite, ni, o, galena, pb, s, alabandite, mn, s, chlorargyrite, ag, cl, and, osbornite, ti, n, 150, 151, a, few, minerals, are, chemical, elements, including, sulfur, copper, silver, and, gold, but, the, vast, majority, are, compounds, the, classical, method, for, identifying, composition, is, wet, chemical, analysis, which, involves, dissolving, a, mineral, in, an, acid, such, as, hydrochloric, acid, hcl, the, elements, in, solution, are, then, identified, using, colorimetry, volumetric, analysis, or, gravimetric, analysis, 224, 225, since, 1960, most, chemistry, analysis, is, done, using, instruments, one, of, these, atomic, absorption, spectroscopy, is, similar, to, wet, chemistry, in, that, the, sample, must, still, be, dissolved, but, it, is, much, faster, and, cheaper, the, solution, is, vaporized, and, its, absorption, spectrum, is, measured, in, the, visible, and, ultraviolet, range, 225, 226, other, techniques, are, x, ray, fluorescence, electron, microprobe, analysis, atom, probe, tomography, and, optical, emission, spectrography, 227, 232, in, addition, to, macroscopic, properties, such, as, colour, or, lustre, minerals, have, properties, that, require, a, polarizing, microscope, to, observe, when, light, passes, from, air, or, a, vacuum, into, a, transparent, crystal, some, of, it, is, reflected, at, the, surface, and, some, refracted, the, latter, is, a, bending, of, the, light, path, that, occurs, because, the, speed, of, light, changes, as, it, goes, into, the, crystal, snell, s, law, relates, the, bending, angle, to, the, refractive, index, the, ratio, of, speed, in, a, vacuum, to, speed, in, the, crystal, crystals, whose, point, symmetry, group, falls, in, the, cubic, system, are, isotropic, the, index, does, not, depend, on, direction, all, other, crystals, are, anisotropic, light, passing, through, them, is, broken, up, into, two, plane, polarized, rays, that, travel, at, different, speeds, and, refract, at, different, angles, 289, 291, a, polarizing, microscope, is, similar, to, an, ordinary, microscope, but, it, has, two, plane, polarized, filters, a, polarizer, below, the, sample, and, an, analyzer, above, it, polarized, perpendicular, to, each, other, light, passes, successively, through, the, polarizer, the, sample, and, the, analyzer, if, there, is, no, sample, the, analyzer, blocks, all, the, light, from, the, polarizer, however, an, anisotropic, sample, will, generally, change, the, polarization, so, some, of, the, light, can, pass, through, thin, sections, and, powders, can, be, used, as, samples, 293, 294, when, an, isotropic, crystal, is, viewed, it, appears, dark, because, it, does, not, change, the, polarization, of, the, light, however, when, it, is, immersed, in, a, calibrated, liquid, with, a, lower, index, of, refraction, and, the, microscope, is, thrown, out, of, focus, a, bright, line, called, a, becke, line, appears, around, the, perimeter, of, the, crystal, by, observing, the, presence, or, absence, of, such, lines, in, liquids, with, different, indices, the, index, of, the, crystal, can, be, estimated, usually, to, within, 0, 003, 294, 295, systematic, mineralogy, is, the, identification, and, classification, of, minerals, by, their, properties, historically, mineralogy, was, heavily, concerned, with, taxonomy, of, the, rock, forming, minerals, in, 1959, the, international, mineralogical, association, formed, the, commission, of, new, minerals, and, mineral, names, to, rationalize, the, nomenclature, and, regulate, the, introduction, of, new, names, in, july, 2006, it, was, merged, with, the, commission, on, classification, of, minerals, to, form, the, commission, on, new, minerals, nomenclature, and, classification, there, are, over, 6, 000, named, and, unnamed, minerals, and, about, 100, are, discovered, each, year, the, manual, of, mineralogy, places, minerals, in, the, following, classes, native, elements, sulfides, sulfosalts, oxides, and, hydroxides, halides, carbonates, nitrates, and, borates, sulfates, chromates, molybdates, and, tungstates, phosphates, arsenates, and, vanadates, and, silicates, the, environments, of, mineral, formation, and, growth, are, highly, varied, ranging, from, slow, crystallization, at, the, high, temperatures, and, pressures, of, igneous, melts, deep, within, the, earth, s, crust, to, the, low, temperature, precipitation, from, a, saline, brine, at, the, earth, s, surface, various, possible, methods, of, formation, include, biomineralogy, is, a, cross, over, field, between, mineralogy, paleontology, and, biology, it, is, the, study, of, how, plants, and, animals, stabilize, minerals, under, biological, control, and, the, sequencing, of, mineral, replacement, of, those, minerals, after, deposition, it, uses, techniques, from, chemical, mineralogy, especially, isotopic, studies, to, determine, such, things, as, growth, forms, in, living, plants, and, animals, as, well, as, things, like, the, original, mineral, content, of, fossils, a, new, approach, to, mineralogy, called, mineral, evolution, explores, the, co, evolution, of, the, geosphere, and, biosphere, including, the, role, of, minerals, in, the, origin, of, life, and, processes, as, mineral, catalyzed, organic, synthesis, and, the, selective, adsorption, of, organic, molecules, on, mineral, surfaces, in, 2011, several, researchers, began, to, develop, a, mineral, evolution, database, this, database, integrates, the, crowd, sourced, site, mindat, org, which, has, over, 690, 000, mineral, locality, pairs, with, the, official, ima, list, of, approved, minerals, and, age, data, from, geological, publications, this, database, makes, it, possible, to, apply, statistics, to, answer, new, questions, an, approach, that, has, been, called, mineral, ecology, one, such, question, is, how, much, of, mineral, evolution, is, deterministic, and, how, much, the, result, of, chance, some, factors, are, deterministic, such, as, the, chemical, nature, of, a, mineral, and, conditions, for, its, stability, but, mineralogy, can, also, be, affected, by, the, processes, that, determine, a, planet, s, composition, in, a, 2015, paper, robert, hazen, and, others, analyzed, the, number, of, minerals, involving, each, element, as, a, function, of, its, abundance, they, found, that, earth, with, over, 4800, known, minerals, and, 72, elements, has, a, power, law, relationship, the, moon, with, only, 63, minerals, and, 24, elements, based, on, a, much, smaller, sample, has, essentially, the, same, relationship, this, implies, that, given, the, chemical, composition, of, the, planet, one, could, predict, the, more, common, minerals, however, the, distribution, has, a, long, tail, with, 34, of, the, minerals, having, been, found, at, only, one, or, two, locations, the, model, predicts, that, thousands, more, mineral, species, may, await, discovery, or, have, formed, and, then, been, lost, to, erosion, burial, or, other, processes, this, implies, a, role, of, chance, in, the, formation, of, rare, minerals, occur, in, another, use, of, big, data, sets, network, theory, was, applied, to, a, dataset, of, carbon, minerals, revealing, new, patterns, in, their, diversity, and, distribution, the, analysis, can, show, which, minerals, tend, to, coexist, and, what, conditions, geological, physical, chemical, and, biological, are, associated, with, them, this, information, can, be, used, to, predict, where, to, look, for, new, deposits, and, even, new, mineral, species, minerals, are, essential, to, various, needs, within, human, society, such, as, minerals, used, as, ores, for, essential, components, of, metal, products, used, in, various, commodities, and, machinery, essential, components, to, building, materials, such, as, limestone, marble, granite, gravel, glass, plaster, cement, etc, minerals, are, also, used, in, fertilizers, to, enrich, the, growth, of, agricultural, crops, mineral, collecting, is, also, a, recreational, study, and, collection, hobby, with, clubs, and, societies, representing, the, field, museums, such, as, the, smithsonian, national, museum, of, natural, history, hall, of, geology, gems, and, minerals, the, natural, history, museum, of, los, angeles, county, the, carnegie, museum, of, natural, history, the, natural, history, museum, london, and, the, private, mim, mineral, museum, in, beirut, lebanon, have, popular, collections, of, mineral, specimens, on, permanent, display
