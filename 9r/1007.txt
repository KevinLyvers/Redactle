the, viscosity, of, a, fluid, is, a, measure, of, its, resistance, to, deformation, at, a, given, rate, for, liquids, it, corresponds, to, the, informal, concept, of, thickness, for, example, syrup, has, a, higher, viscosity, than, water, viscosity, is, defined, scientifically, as, a, force, multiplied, by, a, time, divided, by, an, area, thus, its, si, units, are, newton, seconds, per, square, meter, or, pascal, seconds, viscosity, quantifies, the, internal, frictional, force, between, adjacent, layers, of, fluid, that, are, in, relative, motion, for, instance, when, a, viscous, fluid, is, forced, through, a, tube, it, flows, more, quickly, near, the, tube, s, center, line, than, near, its, walls, experiments, show, that, some, stress, such, as, a, pressure, difference, between, the, two, ends, of, the, tube, is, needed, to, sustain, the, flow, this, is, because, a, force, is, required, to, overcome, the, friction, between, the, layers, of, the, fluid, which, are, in, relative, motion, for, a, tube, with, a, constant, rate, of, flow, the, strength, of, the, compensating, force, is, proportional, to, the, fluid, s, viscosity, in, general, viscosity, depends, on, a, fluid, s, state, such, as, its, temperature, pressure, and, rate, of, deformation, however, the, dependence, on, some, of, these, properties, is, negligible, in, certain, cases, for, example, the, viscosity, of, a, newtonian, fluid, does, not, vary, significantly, with, the, rate, of, deformation, zero, viscosity, no, resistance, to, shear, stress, is, observed, only, at, very, low, temperatures, in, superfluids, otherwise, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, requires, all, fluids, to, have, positive, viscosity, a, fluid, that, has, zero, viscosity, non, viscous, is, called, ideal, or, inviscid, for, non, newtonian, fluid, s, viscosity, there, are, pseudoplastic, plastic, and, dilatant, flows, that, are, time, independent, and, there, are, thixotropic, and, rheopectic, flows, that, are, time, dependent, the, word, viscosity, is, derived, from, the, latin, viscum, mistletoe, viscum, also, referred, to, a, viscous, glue, derived, from, mistletoe, berries, in, materials, science, and, engineering, there, is, often, interest, in, understanding, the, forces, or, stresses, involved, in, the, deformation, of, a, material, for, instance, if, the, material, were, a, simple, spring, the, answer, would, be, given, by, hooke, s, law, which, says, that, the, force, experienced, by, a, spring, is, proportional, to, the, distance, displaced, from, equilibrium, stresses, which, can, be, attributed, to, the, deformation, of, a, material, from, some, rest, state, are, called, elastic, stresses, in, other, materials, stresses, are, present, which, can, be, attributed, to, the, deformation, rate, over, time, these, are, called, viscous, stresses, for, instance, in, a, fluid, such, as, water, the, stresses, which, arise, from, shearing, the, fluid, do, not, depend, on, the, distance, the, fluid, has, been, sheared, rather, they, depend, on, how, quickly, the, shearing, occurs, viscosity, is, the, material, property, which, relates, the, viscous, stresses, in, a, material, to, the, rate, of, change, of, a, deformation, the, strain, rate, although, it, applies, to, general, flows, it, is, easy, to, visualize, and, define, in, a, simple, shearing, flow, such, as, a, planar, couette, flow, in, the, couette, flow, a, fluid, is, trapped, between, two, infinitely, large, plates, one, fixed, and, one, in, parallel, motion, at, constant, speed, u, displaystyle, u, see, illustration, to, the, right, if, the, speed, of, the, top, plate, is, low, enough, to, avoid, turbulence, then, in, steady, state, the, fluid, particles, move, parallel, to, it, and, their, speed, varies, from, 0, displaystyle, 0, at, the, bottom, to, u, displaystyle, u, at, the, top, each, layer, of, fluid, moves, faster, than, the, one, just, below, it, and, friction, between, them, gives, rise, to, a, force, resisting, their, relative, motion, in, particular, the, fluid, applies, on, the, top, plate, a, force, in, the, direction, opposite, to, its, motion, and, an, equal, but, opposite, force, on, the, bottom, plate, an, external, force, is, therefore, required, in, order, to, keep, the, top, plate, moving, at, constant, speed, in, many, fluids, the, flow, velocity, is, observed, to, vary, linearly, from, zero, at, the, bottom, to, u, displaystyle, u, at, the, top, moreover, the, magnitude, of, the, force, f, displaystyle, f, acting, on, the, top, plate, is, found, to, be, proportional, to, the, speed, u, displaystyle, u, and, the, area, a, displaystyle, a, of, each, plate, and, inversely, proportional, to, their, separation, y, displaystyle, y, the, proportionality, factor, is, the, dynamic, viscosity, of, the, fluid, often, simply, referred, to, as, the, viscosity, it, is, denoted, by, the, greek, letter, mu, the, dynamic, viscosity, has, the, dimensions, m, a, s, s, l, e, n, g, t, h, t, i, m, e, displaystyle, mathrm, mass, length, time, therefore, resulting, in, the, si, units, and, the, derived, units, the, aforementioned, ratio, u, y, displaystyle, u, y, is, called, the, rate, of, shear, deformation, or, shear, velocity, and, is, the, derivative, of, the, fluid, speed, in, the, direction, parallel, to, the, normal, vector, of, the, plates, see, illustrations, to, the, right, if, the, velocity, does, not, vary, linearly, with, y, displaystyle, y, then, the, appropriate, generalization, is, where, f, a, displaystyle, tau, f, a, and, u, y, displaystyle, partial, u, partial, y, is, the, local, shear, velocity, this, expression, is, referred, to, as, newton, s, law, of, viscosity, in, shearing, flows, with, planar, symmetry, it, is, what, defines, displaystyle, mu, it, is, a, special, case, of, the, general, definition, of, viscosity, see, below, which, can, be, expressed, in, coordinate, free, form, use, of, the, greek, letter, mu, displaystyle, mu, for, the, dynamic, viscosity, sometimes, also, called, the, absolute, viscosity, is, common, among, mechanical, and, chemical, engineers, as, well, as, mathematicians, and, physicists, however, the, greek, letter, eta, displaystyle, eta, is, also, used, by, chemists, physicists, and, the, iupac, the, viscosity, displaystyle, mu, is, sometimes, also, called, the, shear, viscosity, however, at, least, one, author, discourages, the, use, of, this, terminology, noting, that, displaystyle, mu, can, appear, in, non, shearing, flows, in, addition, to, shearing, flows, in, fluid, dynamics, it, is, sometimes, more, appropriate, to, work, in, terms, of, kinematic, viscosity, sometimes, also, called, the, momentum, diffusivity, defined, as, the, ratio, of, the, dynamic, viscosity, over, the, density, of, the, fluid, it, is, usually, denoted, by, the, greek, letter, nu, and, has, the, dimensions, l, e, n, g, t, h, 2, t, i, m, e, displaystyle, mathrm, length, 2, time, therefore, resulting, in, the, si, units, and, the, derived, units, in, very, general, terms, the, viscous, stresses, in, a, fluid, are, defined, as, those, resulting, from, the, relative, velocity, of, different, fluid, particles, as, such, the, viscous, stresses, must, depend, on, spatial, gradients, of, the, flow, velocity, if, the, velocity, gradients, are, small, then, to, a, first, approximation, the, viscous, stresses, depend, only, on, the, first, derivatives, of, the, velocity, for, newtonian, fluids, this, is, also, a, linear, dependence, in, cartesian, coordinates, the, general, relationship, can, then, be, written, as, where, i, j, k, displaystyle, mu, ijk, ell, is, a, viscosity, tensor, that, maps, the, velocity, gradient, tensor, v, k, r, displaystyle, partial, v, k, partial, r, ell, onto, the, viscous, stress, tensor, i, j, displaystyle, tau, ij, since, the, indices, in, this, expression, can, vary, from, 1, to, 3, there, are, 81, viscosity, coefficients, i, j, k, l, displaystyle, mu, ijkl, in, total, however, assuming, that, the, viscosity, rank, 2, tensor, is, isotropic, reduces, these, 81, coefficients, to, three, independent, parameters, displaystyle, alpha, displaystyle, beta, displaystyle, gamma, and, furthermore, it, is, assumed, that, no, viscous, forces, may, arise, when, the, fluid, is, undergoing, simple, rigid, body, rotation, thus, displaystyle, beta, gamma, leaving, only, two, independent, parameters, the, most, usual, decomposition, is, in, terms, of, the, standard, scalar, viscosity, displaystyle, mu, and, the, bulk, viscosity, displaystyle, kappa, such, that, 2, 3, displaystyle, alpha, kappa, tfrac, 2, 3, mu, and, displaystyle, beta, gamma, mu, in, vector, notation, this, appears, as, where, displaystyle, mathbf, delta, is, the, unit, tensor, this, equation, can, be, thought, of, as, a, generalized, form, of, newton, s, law, of, viscosity, the, bulk, viscosity, also, called, volume, viscosity, expresses, a, type, of, internal, friction, that, resists, the, shearless, compression, or, expansion, of, a, fluid, knowledge, of, displaystyle, kappa, is, frequently, not, necessary, in, fluid, dynamics, problems, for, example, an, incompressible, fluid, satisfies, v, 0, displaystyle, nabla, cdot, mathbf, v, 0, and, so, the, term, containing, displaystyle, kappa, drops, out, moreover, displaystyle, kappa, is, often, assumed, to, be, negligible, for, gases, since, it, is, 0, displaystyle, 0, in, a, monatomic, ideal, gas, one, situation, in, which, displaystyle, kappa, can, be, important, is, the, calculation, of, energy, loss, in, sound, and, shock, waves, described, by, stokes, law, of, sound, attenuation, since, these, phenomena, involve, rapid, expansions, and, compressions, the, defining, equations, for, viscosity, are, not, fundamental, laws, of, nature, so, their, usefulness, as, well, as, methods, for, measuring, or, calculating, the, viscosity, must, be, established, using, separate, means, a, potential, issue, is, that, viscosity, depends, in, principle, on, the, full, microscopic, state, of, the, fluid, which, encompasses, the, positions, and, momenta, of, every, particle, in, the, system, such, highly, detailed, information, is, typically, not, available, in, realistic, systems, however, under, certain, conditions, most, of, this, information, can, be, shown, to, be, negligible, in, particular, for, newtonian, fluids, near, equilibrium, and, far, from, boundaries, bulk, state, the, viscosity, depends, only, space, and, time, dependent, macroscopic, fields, such, as, temperature, and, density, defining, local, equilibrium, nevertheless, viscosity, may, still, carry, a, non, negligible, dependence, on, several, system, properties, such, as, temperature, pressure, and, the, amplitude, and, frequency, of, any, external, forcing, therefore, precision, measurements, of, viscosity, are, only, defined, with, respect, to, a, specific, fluid, state, to, standardize, comparisons, among, experiments, and, theoretical, models, viscosity, data, is, sometimes, extrapolated, to, ideal, limiting, cases, such, as, the, zero, shear, limit, or, for, gases, the, zero, density, limit, transport, theory, provides, an, alternative, interpretation, of, viscosity, in, terms, of, momentum, transport, viscosity, is, the, material, property, which, characterizes, momentum, transport, within, a, fluid, just, as, thermal, conductivity, characterizes, heat, transport, and, mass, diffusivity, characterizes, mass, transport, this, perspective, is, implicit, in, newton, s, law, of, viscosity, u, y, displaystyle, tau, mu, partial, u, partial, y, because, the, shear, stress, displaystyle, tau, has, units, equivalent, to, a, momentum, flux, i, e, momentum, per, unit, time, per, unit, area, thus, displaystyle, tau, can, be, interpreted, as, specifying, the, flow, of, momentum, in, the, y, displaystyle, y, direction, from, one, fluid, layer, to, the, next, per, newton, s, law, of, viscosity, this, momentum, flow, occurs, across, a, velocity, gradient, and, the, magnitude, of, the, corresponding, momentum, flux, is, determined, by, the, viscosity, the, analogy, with, heat, and, mass, transfer, can, be, made, explicit, just, as, heat, flows, from, high, temperature, to, low, temperature, and, mass, flows, from, high, density, to, low, density, momentum, flows, from, high, velocity, to, low, velocity, these, behaviors, are, all, described, by, compact, expressions, called, constitutive, relations, whose, one, dimensional, forms, are, given, here, where, displaystyle, rho, is, the, density, j, displaystyle, mathbf, j, and, q, displaystyle, mathbf, q, are, the, mass, and, heat, fluxes, and, d, displaystyle, d, and, k, t, displaystyle, k, t, are, the, mass, diffusivity, and, thermal, conductivity, the, fact, that, mass, momentum, and, energy, heat, transport, are, among, the, most, relevant, processes, in, continuum, mechanics, is, not, a, coincidence, these, are, among, the, few, physical, quantities, that, are, conserved, at, the, microscopic, level, in, interparticle, collisions, thus, rather, than, being, dictated, by, the, fast, and, complex, microscopic, interaction, timescale, their, dynamics, occurs, on, macroscopic, timescales, as, described, by, the, various, equations, of, transport, theory, and, hydrodynamics, newton, s, law, of, viscosity, is, not, a, fundamental, law, of, nature, but, rather, a, constitutive, equation, like, hooke, s, law, fick, s, law, and, ohm, s, law, which, serves, to, define, the, viscosity, displaystyle, mu, its, form, is, motivated, by, experiments, which, show, that, for, a, wide, range, of, fluids, displaystyle, mu, is, independent, of, strain, rate, such, fluids, are, called, newtonian, gases, water, and, many, common, liquids, can, be, considered, newtonian, in, ordinary, conditions, and, contexts, however, there, are, many, non, newtonian, fluids, that, significantly, deviate, from, this, behavior, for, example, trouton, s, ratio, is, the, ratio, of, extensional, viscosity, to, shear, viscosity, for, a, newtonian, fluid, the, trouton, ratio, is, 3, shear, thinning, liquids, are, very, commonly, but, misleadingly, described, as, thixotropic, viscosity, may, also, depend, on, the, fluid, s, physical, state, temperature, and, pressure, and, other, external, factors, for, gases, and, other, compressible, fluids, it, depends, on, temperature, and, varies, very, slowly, with, pressure, the, viscosity, of, some, fluids, may, depend, on, other, factors, a, magnetorheological, fluid, for, example, becomes, thicker, when, subjected, to, a, magnetic, field, possibly, to, the, point, of, behaving, like, a, solid, the, viscous, forces, that, arise, during, fluid, flow, are, distinct, from, the, elastic, forces, that, occur, in, a, solid, in, response, to, shear, compression, or, extension, stresses, while, in, the, latter, the, stress, is, proportional, to, the, amount, of, shear, deformation, in, a, fluid, it, is, proportional, to, the, rate, of, deformation, over, time, for, this, reason, james, clerk, maxwell, used, the, term, fugitive, elasticity, for, fluid, viscosity, however, many, liquids, including, water, will, briefly, react, like, elastic, solids, when, subjected, to, sudden, stress, conversely, many, solids, even, granite, will, flow, like, liquids, albeit, very, slowly, even, under, arbitrarily, small, stress, such, materials, are, best, described, as, viscoelastic, that, is, possessing, both, elasticity, reaction, to, deformation, and, viscosity, reaction, to, rate, of, deformation, viscoelastic, solids, may, exhibit, both, shear, viscosity, and, bulk, viscosity, the, extensional, viscosity, is, a, linear, combination, of, the, shear, and, bulk, viscosities, that, describes, the, reaction, of, a, solid, elastic, material, to, elongation, it, is, widely, used, for, characterizing, polymers, in, geology, earth, materials, that, exhibit, viscous, deformation, at, least, three, orders, of, magnitude, greater, than, their, elastic, deformation, are, sometimes, called, rheids, viscosity, is, measured, with, various, types, of, viscometers, and, rheometers, close, temperature, control, of, the, fluid, is, essential, to, obtain, accurate, measurements, particularly, in, materials, like, lubricants, whose, viscosity, can, double, with, a, change, of, only, 5, c, a, rheometer, is, used, for, fluids, that, cannot, be, defined, by, a, single, value, of, viscosity, and, therefore, require, more, parameters, to, be, set, and, measured, than, is, the, case, for, a, viscometer, for, some, fluids, the, viscosity, is, constant, over, a, wide, range, of, shear, rates, newtonian, fluids, the, fluids, without, a, constant, viscosity, non, newtonian, fluids, cannot, be, described, by, a, single, number, non, newtonian, fluids, exhibit, a, variety, of, different, correlations, between, shear, stress, and, shear, rate, one, of, the, most, common, instruments, for, measuring, kinematic, viscosity, is, the, glass, capillary, viscometer, in, coating, industries, viscosity, may, be, measured, with, a, cup, in, which, the, efflux, time, is, measured, there, are, several, sorts, of, cup, such, as, the, zahn, cup, and, the, ford, viscosity, cup, with, the, usage, of, each, type, varying, mainly, according, to, the, industry, also, used, in, coatings, a, stormer, viscometer, employs, load, based, rotation, to, determine, viscosity, the, viscosity, is, reported, in, krebs, units, ku, which, are, unique, to, stormer, viscometers, vibrating, viscometers, can, also, be, used, to, measure, viscosity, resonant, or, vibrational, viscometers, work, by, creating, shear, waves, within, the, liquid, in, this, method, the, sensor, is, submerged, in, the, fluid, and, is, made, to, resonate, at, a, specific, frequency, as, the, surface, of, the, sensor, shears, through, the, liquid, energy, is, lost, due, to, its, viscosity, this, dissipated, energy, is, then, measured, and, converted, into, a, viscosity, reading, a, higher, viscosity, causes, a, greater, loss, of, energy, extensional, viscosity, can, be, measured, with, various, rheometers, that, apply, extensional, stress, volume, viscosity, can, be, measured, with, an, acoustic, rheometer, apparent, viscosity, is, a, calculation, derived, from, tests, performed, on, drilling, fluid, used, in, oil, or, gas, well, development, these, calculations, and, tests, help, engineers, develop, and, maintain, the, properties, of, the, drilling, fluid, to, the, specifications, required, nanoviscosity, viscosity, sensed, by, nanoprobes, can, be, measured, by, fluorescence, correlation, spectroscopy, the, si, unit, of, dynamic, viscosity, is, the, newton, second, per, square, meter, n, s, m, 2, also, frequently, expressed, in, the, equivalent, forms, pascal, second, pa, s, kilogram, per, meter, per, second, kg, m, 1, s, 1, and, poiseuille, pl, the, cgs, unit, is, the, poise, p, or, g, cm, 1, s, 1, 0, 1, pa, s, named, after, jean, l, onard, marie, poiseuille, it, is, commonly, expressed, particularly, in, astm, standards, as, centipoise, cp, the, centipoise, is, convenient, because, the, viscosity, of, water, at, 20, c, is, about, 1, cp, and, one, centipoise, is, equal, to, the, si, millipascal, second, mpa, s, the, si, unit, of, kinematic, viscosity, is, square, meter, per, second, m, 2, s, whereas, the, cgs, unit, for, kinematic, viscosity, is, the, stokes, st, or, cm, 2, s, 1, 0, 0001, m, 2, s, 1, named, after, sir, george, gabriel, stokes, in, u, s, usage, stoke, is, sometimes, used, as, the, singular, form, the, submultiple, centistokes, cst, is, often, used, instead, 1, cst, 1, mm, 2, s, 1, 10, 6, m, 2, s, 1, 1, cst, is, 1, cp, divided, by, 1000, kg, m, 3, close, to, the, density, of, water, the, kinematic, viscosity, of, water, at, 20, c, is, about, 1, cst, the, most, frequently, used, systems, of, us, customary, or, imperial, units, are, the, british, gravitational, bg, and, english, engineering, ee, in, the, bg, system, dynamic, viscosity, has, units, of, pound, seconds, per, square, foot, lb, s, ft, 2, and, in, the, ee, system, it, has, units, of, pound, force, seconds, per, square, foot, lbf, s, ft, 2, the, pound, and, pound, force, are, equivalent, the, two, systems, differ, only, in, how, force, and, mass, are, defined, in, the, bg, system, the, pound, is, a, basic, unit, from, which, the, unit, of, mass, the, slug, is, defined, by, newton, s, second, law, whereas, in, the, ee, system, the, units, of, force, and, mass, the, pound, force, and, pound, mass, respectively, are, defined, independently, through, the, second, law, using, the, proportionality, constant, g, c, kinematic, viscosity, has, units, of, square, feet, per, second, ft, 2, s, in, both, the, bg, and, ee, systems, nonstandard, units, include, the, reyn, lbf, s, in, 2, a, british, unit, of, dynamic, viscosity, in, the, automotive, industry, the, viscosity, index, is, used, to, describe, the, change, of, viscosity, with, temperature, the, reciprocal, of, viscosity, is, fluidity, usually, symbolized, by, 1, displaystyle, phi, 1, mu, or, f, 1, displaystyle, f, 1, mu, depending, on, the, convention, used, measured, in, reciprocal, poise, p, 1, or, cm, s, g, 1, sometimes, called, the, rhe, fluidity, is, seldom, used, in, engineering, practice, at, one, time, the, petroleum, industry, relied, on, measuring, kinematic, viscosity, by, means, of, the, saybolt, viscometer, and, expressing, kinematic, viscosity, in, units, of, saybolt, universal, seconds, sus, other, abbreviations, such, as, ssu, saybolt, seconds, universal, or, suv, saybolt, universal, viscosity, are, sometimes, used, kinematic, viscosity, in, centistokes, can, be, converted, from, sus, according, to, the, arithmetic, and, the, reference, table, provided, in, astm, d, 2161, momentum, transport, in, gases, is, mediated, by, discrete, molecular, collisions, and, in, liquids, by, attractive, forces, that, bind, molecules, close, together, because, of, this, the, dynamic, viscosities, of, liquids, are, typically, much, larger, than, those, of, gases, in, addition, viscosity, tends, to, increase, with, temperature, in, gases, and, decrease, with, temperature, in, liquids, above, the, liquid, gas, critical, point, the, liquid, and, gas, phases, are, replaced, by, a, single, supercritical, phase, in, this, regime, the, mechanisms, of, momentum, transport, interpolate, between, liquid, like, and, gas, like, behavior, for, example, along, a, supercritical, isobar, constant, pressure, surface, the, kinematic, viscosity, decreases, at, low, temperature, and, increases, at, high, temperature, with, a, minimum, in, between, a, rough, estimate, for, the, value, at, the, minimum, is, where, displaystyle, hbar, is, the, planck, constant, m, e, displaystyle, m, text, e, is, the, electron, mass, and, m, displaystyle, m, is, the, molecular, mass, in, general, however, the, viscosity, of, a, system, depends, in, detail, on, how, the, molecules, constituting, the, system, interact, and, there, are, no, simple, but, correct, formulas, for, it, the, simplest, exact, expressions, are, the, green, kubo, relations, for, the, linear, shear, viscosity, or, the, transient, time, correlation, function, expressions, derived, by, evans, and, morriss, in, 1988, although, these, expressions, are, each, exact, calculating, the, viscosity, of, a, dense, fluid, using, these, relations, currently, requires, the, use, of, molecular, dynamics, computer, simulations, somewhat, more, progress, can, be, made, for, a, dilute, gas, as, elementary, assumptions, about, how, gas, molecules, move, and, interact, lead, to, a, basic, understanding, of, the, molecular, origins, of, viscosity, more, sophisticated, treatments, can, be, constructed, by, systematically, coarse, graining, the, equations, of, motion, of, the, gas, molecules, an, example, of, such, a, treatment, is, chapman, enskog, theory, which, derives, expressions, for, the, viscosity, of, a, dilute, gas, from, the, boltzmann, equation, consider, a, dilute, gas, moving, parallel, to, the, x, displaystyle, x, axis, with, velocity, u, y, displaystyle, u, y, that, depends, only, on, the, y, displaystyle, y, coordinate, to, simplify, the, discussion, the, gas, is, assumed, to, have, uniform, temperature, and, density, under, these, assumptions, the, x, displaystyle, x, velocity, of, a, molecule, passing, through, y, 0, displaystyle, y, 0, is, equal, to, whatever, velocity, that, molecule, had, when, its, mean, free, path, displaystyle, lambda, began, because, displaystyle, lambda, is, typically, small, compared, with, macroscopic, scales, the, average, x, displaystyle, x, velocity, of, such, a, molecule, has, the, form, where, displaystyle, alpha, is, a, numerical, constant, on, the, order, of, 1, displaystyle, 1, some, authors, estimate, 2, 3, displaystyle, alpha, 2, 3, on, the, other, hand, a, more, careful, calculation, for, rigid, elastic, spheres, gives, 0, 998, displaystyle, alpha, simeq, 0, 998, next, because, half, the, molecules, on, either, side, are, moving, towards, y, 0, displaystyle, y, 0, and, doing, so, on, average, with, half, the, average, molecular, speed, 8, k, b, t, m, 1, 2, displaystyle, 8k, text, b, t, pi, m, 1, 2, the, momentum, flux, from, either, side, is, the, net, momentum, flux, at, y, 0, displaystyle, y, 0, is, the, difference, of, the, two, according, to, the, definition, of, viscosity, this, momentum, flux, should, be, equal, to, d, u, d, y, 0, displaystyle, mu, frac, du, dy, 0, which, leads, to, viscosity, in, gases, arises, principally, from, the, molecular, diffusion, that, transports, momentum, between, layers, of, flow, an, elementary, calculation, for, a, dilute, gas, at, temperature, t, displaystyle, t, and, density, displaystyle, rho, gives, where, k, b, displaystyle, k, text, b, is, the, boltzmann, constant, m, displaystyle, m, the, molecular, mass, and, displaystyle, alpha, a, numerical, constant, on, the, order, of, 1, displaystyle, 1, the, quantity, displaystyle, lambda, the, mean, free, path, measures, the, average, distance, a, molecule, travels, between, collisions, even, without, a, priori, knowledge, of, displaystyle, alpha, this, expression, has, nontrivial, implications, in, particular, since, displaystyle, lambda, is, typically, inversely, proportional, to, density, and, increases, with, temperature, displaystyle, mu, itself, should, increase, with, temperature, and, be, independent, of, density, at, fixed, temperature, in, fact, both, of, these, predictions, persist, in, more, sophisticated, treatments, and, accurately, describe, experimental, observations, by, contrast, liquid, viscosity, typically, decreases, with, temperature, for, rigid, elastic, spheres, of, diameter, displaystyle, sigma, displaystyle, lambda, can, be, computed, giving, in, this, case, displaystyle, lambda, is, independent, of, temperature, so, t, 1, 2, displaystyle, mu, propto, t, 1, 2, for, more, complicated, molecular, models, however, displaystyle, lambda, depends, on, temperature, in, a, non, trivial, way, and, simple, kinetic, arguments, as, used, here, are, inadequate, more, fundamentally, the, notion, of, a, mean, free, path, becomes, imprecise, for, particles, that, interact, over, a, finite, range, which, limits, the, usefulness, of, the, concept, for, describing, real, world, gases, a, technique, developed, by, sydney, chapman, and, david, enskog, in, the, early, 1900s, allows, a, more, refined, calculation, of, displaystyle, mu, it, is, based, on, the, boltzmann, equation, which, provides, a, statistical, description, of, a, dilute, gas, in, terms, of, intermolecular, interactions, the, technique, allows, accurate, calculation, of, displaystyle, mu, for, molecular, models, that, are, more, realistic, than, rigid, elastic, spheres, such, as, those, incorporating, intermolecular, attractions, doing, so, is, necessary, to, reproduce, the, correct, temperature, dependence, of, displaystyle, mu, which, experiments, show, increases, more, rapidly, than, the, t, 1, 2, displaystyle, t, 1, 2, trend, predicted, for, rigid, elastic, spheres, indeed, the, chapman, enskog, analysis, shows, that, the, predicted, temperature, dependence, can, be, tuned, by, varying, the, parameters, in, various, molecular, models, a, simple, example, is, the, sutherland, model, which, describes, rigid, elastic, spheres, with, weak, mutual, attraction, in, such, a, case, the, attractive, force, can, be, treated, perturbatively, which, leads, to, a, simple, expression, for, displaystyle, mu, where, s, displaystyle, s, is, independent, of, temperature, being, determined, only, by, the, parameters, of, the, intermolecular, attraction, to, connect, with, experiment, it, is, convenient, to, rewrite, as, where, 0, displaystyle, mu, 0, is, the, viscosity, at, temperature, t, 0, displaystyle, t, 0, this, expression, is, usually, named, sutherland, s, formula, if, displaystyle, mu, is, known, from, experiments, at, t, t, 0, displaystyle, t, t, 0, and, at, least, one, other, temperature, then, s, displaystyle, s, can, be, calculated, expressions, for, displaystyle, mu, obtained, in, this, way, are, qualitatively, accurate, for, a, number, of, simple, gases, slightly, more, sophisticated, models, such, as, the, lennard, jones, potential, or, the, more, flexible, mie, potential, may, provide, better, agreement, with, experiments, but, only, at, the, cost, of, a, more, opaque, dependence, on, temperature, a, further, advantage, of, these, more, complex, interaction, potentials, is, that, they, can, be, used, to, develop, accurate, models, for, a, wide, variety, of, properties, using, the, same, potential, parameters, in, situations, where, little, experimental, data, is, available, this, makes, it, possible, to, obtain, model, parameters, from, fitting, to, properties, such, as, pure, fluid, vapour, liquid, equilibria, before, using, the, parameters, thus, obtained, to, predict, the, viscosities, of, interest, with, reasonable, accuracy, in, some, systems, the, assumption, of, spherical, symmetry, must, be, abandoned, as, is, the, case, for, vapors, with, highly, polar, molecules, like, h, 2, o, in, these, cases, the, chapman, enskog, analysis, is, significantly, more, complicated, in, the, kinetic, molecular, picture, a, non, zero, bulk, viscosity, arises, in, gases, whenever, there, are, non, negligible, relaxational, timescales, governing, the, exchange, of, energy, between, the, translational, energy, of, molecules, and, their, internal, energy, e, g, rotational, and, vibrational, as, such, the, bulk, viscosity, is, 0, displaystyle, 0, for, a, monatomic, ideal, gas, in, which, the, internal, energy, of, molecules, is, negligible, but, is, nonzero, for, a, gas, like, carbon, dioxide, whose, molecules, possess, both, rotational, and, vibrational, energy, in, contrast, with, gases, there, is, no, simple, yet, accurate, picture, for, the, molecular, origins, of, viscosity, in, liquids, at, the, simplest, level, of, description, the, relative, motion, of, adjacent, layers, in, a, liquid, is, opposed, primarily, by, attractive, molecular, forces, acting, across, the, layer, boundary, in, this, picture, one, correctly, expects, viscosity, to, decrease, with, increasing, temperature, this, is, because, increasing, temperature, increases, the, random, thermal, motion, of, the, molecules, which, makes, it, easier, for, them, to, overcome, their, attractive, interactions, building, on, this, visualization, a, simple, theory, can, be, constructed, in, analogy, with, the, discrete, structure, of, a, solid, groups, of, molecules, in, a, liquid, are, visualized, as, forming, cages, which, surround, and, enclose, single, molecules, these, cages, can, be, occupied, or, unoccupied, and, stronger, molecular, attraction, corresponds, to, stronger, cages, due, to, random, thermal, motion, a, molecule, hops, between, cages, at, a, rate, which, varies, inversely, with, the, strength, of, molecular, attractions, in, equilibrium, these, hops, are, not, biased, in, any, direction, on, the, other, hand, in, order, for, two, adjacent, layers, to, move, relative, to, each, other, the, hops, must, be, biased, in, the, direction, of, the, relative, motion, the, force, required, to, sustain, this, directed, motion, can, be, estimated, for, a, given, shear, rate, leading, to, where, n, a, displaystyle, n, text, a, is, the, avogadro, constant, h, displaystyle, h, is, the, planck, constant, v, displaystyle, v, is, the, volume, of, a, mole, of, liquid, and, t, b, displaystyle, t, text, b, is, the, normal, boiling, point, this, result, has, the, same, form, as, the, well, known, empirical, relation, where, a, displaystyle, a, and, b, displaystyle, b, are, constants, fit, from, data, on, the, other, hand, several, authors, express, caution, with, respect, to, this, model, errors, as, large, as, 30, can, be, encountered, using, equation, 1, compared, with, fitting, equation, 2, to, experimental, data, more, fundamentally, the, physical, assumptions, underlying, equation, 1, have, been, criticized, it, has, also, been, argued, that, the, exponential, dependence, in, equation, 1, does, not, necessarily, describe, experimental, observations, more, accurately, than, simpler, non, exponential, expressions, in, light, of, these, shortcomings, the, development, of, a, less, ad, hoc, model, is, a, matter, of, practical, interest, foregoing, simplicity, in, favor, of, precision, it, is, possible, to, write, rigorous, expressions, for, viscosity, starting, from, the, fundamental, equations, of, motion, for, molecules, a, classic, example, of, this, approach, is, irving, kirkwood, theory, on, the, other, hand, such, expressions, are, given, as, averages, over, multiparticle, correlation, functions, and, are, therefore, difficult, to, apply, in, practice, in, general, empirically, derived, expressions, based, on, existing, viscosity, measurements, appear, to, be, the, only, consistently, reliable, means, of, calculating, viscosity, in, liquids, local, atomic, structure, changes, observed, in, undercooled, liquids, on, cooling, below, the, equilibrium, melting, temperature, either, in, terms, of, radial, distribution, function, g, r, or, structure, factor, s, q, are, found, to, be, directly, responsible, for, the, liquid, fragility, deviation, of, the, temperature, dependence, of, viscosity, of, the, undercooled, liquid, from, the, arrhenius, equation, 2, through, modification, of, the, activation, energy, for, viscous, flow, at, the, same, time, equilibrium, liquids, follow, the, arrhenius, equation, the, same, molecular, kinetic, picture, of, a, single, component, gas, can, also, be, applied, to, a, gaseous, mixture, for, instance, in, the, chapman, enskog, approach, the, viscosity, mix, displaystyle, mu, text, mix, of, a, binary, mixture, of, gases, can, be, written, in, terms, of, the, individual, component, viscosities, 1, 2, displaystyle, mu, 1, 2, their, respective, volume, fractions, and, the, intermolecular, interactions, as, for, the, single, component, gas, the, dependence, of, mix, displaystyle, mu, text, mix, on, the, parameters, of, the, intermolecular, interactions, enters, through, various, collisional, integrals, which, may, not, be, expressible, in, closed, form, to, obtain, usable, expressions, for, mix, displaystyle, mu, text, mix, which, reasonably, match, experimental, data, the, collisional, integrals, may, be, computed, numerically, or, from, correlations, in, some, cases, the, collision, integrals, are, regarded, as, fitting, parameters, and, are, fitted, directly, to, experimental, data, this, is, a, common, approach, in, the, development, of, reference, equations, for, gas, phase, viscosities, an, example, of, such, a, procedure, is, the, sutherland, approach, for, the, single, component, gas, discussed, above, for, gas, mixtures, consisting, of, simple, molecules, revised, enskog, theory, has, been, shown, to, accurately, represent, both, the, density, and, temperature, dependence, of, the, viscosity, over, a, wide, range, of, conditions, as, for, pure, liquids, the, viscosity, of, a, blend, of, liquids, is, difficult, to, predict, from, molecular, principles, one, method, is, to, extend, the, molecular, cage, theory, presented, above, for, a, pure, liquid, this, can, be, done, with, varying, levels, of, sophistication, one, expression, resulting, from, such, an, analysis, is, the, lederer, roegiers, equation, for, a, binary, mixture, where, displaystyle, alpha, is, an, empirical, parameter, and, x, 1, 2, displaystyle, x, 1, 2, and, 1, 2, displaystyle, mu, 1, 2, are, the, respective, mole, fractions, and, viscosities, of, the, component, liquids, since, blending, is, an, important, process, in, the, lubricating, and, oil, industries, a, variety, of, empirical, and, proprietary, equations, exist, for, predicting, the, viscosity, of, a, blend, depending, on, the, solute, and, range, of, concentration, an, aqueous, electrolyte, solution, can, have, either, a, larger, or, smaller, viscosity, compared, with, pure, water, at, the, same, temperature, and, pressure, for, instance, a, 20, saline, sodium, chloride, solution, has, viscosity, over, 1, 5, times, that, of, pure, water, whereas, a, 20, potassium, iodide, solution, has, viscosity, about, 0, 91, times, that, of, pure, water, an, idealized, model, of, dilute, electrolytic, solutions, leads, to, the, following, prediction, for, the, viscosity, s, displaystyle, mu, s, of, a, solution, where, 0, displaystyle, mu, 0, is, the, viscosity, of, the, solvent, c, displaystyle, c, is, the, concentration, and, a, displaystyle, a, is, a, positive, constant, which, depends, on, both, solvent, and, solute, properties, however, this, expression, is, only, valid, for, very, dilute, solutions, having, c, displaystyle, c, less, than, 0, 1, mol, l, for, higher, concentrations, additional, terms, are, necessary, which, account, for, higher, order, molecular, correlations, where, b, displaystyle, b, and, c, displaystyle, c, are, fit, from, data, in, particular, a, negative, value, of, b, displaystyle, b, is, able, to, account, for, the, decrease, in, viscosity, observed, in, some, solutions, estimated, values, of, these, constants, are, shown, below, for, sodium, chloride, and, potassium, iodide, at, temperature, 25, c, mol, mole, l, liter, in, a, suspension, of, solid, particles, e, g, micron, size, spheres, suspended, in, oil, an, effective, viscosity, eff, displaystyle, mu, text, eff, can, be, defined, in, terms, of, stress, and, strain, components, which, are, averaged, over, a, volume, large, compared, with, the, distance, between, the, suspended, particles, but, small, with, respect, to, macroscopic, dimensions, such, suspensions, generally, exhibit, non, newtonian, behavior, however, for, dilute, systems, in, steady, flows, the, behavior, is, newtonian, and, expressions, for, eff, displaystyle, mu, text, eff, can, be, derived, directly, from, the, particle, dynamics, in, a, very, dilute, system, with, volume, fraction, 0, 02, displaystyle, phi, lesssim, 0, 02, interactions, between, the, suspended, particles, can, be, ignored, in, such, a, case, one, can, explicitly, calculate, the, flow, field, around, each, particle, independently, and, combine, the, results, to, obtain, eff, displaystyle, mu, text, eff, for, spheres, this, results, in, the, einstein, s, effective, viscosity, formula, where, 0, displaystyle, mu, 0, is, the, viscosity, of, the, suspending, liquid, the, linear, dependence, on, displaystyle, phi, is, a, consequence, of, neglecting, interparticle, interactions, for, dilute, systems, in, general, one, expects, eff, displaystyle, mu, text, eff, to, take, the, form, where, the, coefficient, b, displaystyle, b, may, depend, on, the, particle, shape, e, g, spheres, rods, disks, experimental, determination, of, the, precise, value, of, b, displaystyle, b, is, difficult, however, even, the, prediction, b, 5, 2, displaystyle, b, 5, 2, for, spheres, has, not, been, conclusively, validated, with, various, experiments, finding, values, in, the, range, 1, 5, b, 5, displaystyle, 1, 5, lesssim, b, lesssim, 5, this, deficiency, has, been, attributed, to, difficulty, in, controlling, experimental, conditions, in, denser, suspensions, eff, displaystyle, mu, text, eff, acquires, a, nonlinear, dependence, on, displaystyle, phi, which, indicates, the, importance, of, interparticle, interactions, various, analytical, and, semi, empirical, schemes, exist, for, capturing, this, regime, at, the, most, basic, level, a, term, quadratic, in, displaystyle, phi, is, added, to, eff, displaystyle, mu, text, eff, and, the, coefficient, b, 1, displaystyle, b, 1, is, fit, from, experimental, data, or, approximated, from, the, microscopic, theory, however, some, authors, advise, caution, in, applying, such, simple, formulas, since, non, newtonian, behavior, appears, in, dense, suspensions, 0, 25, displaystyle, phi, gtrsim, 0, 25, for, spheres, or, in, suspensions, of, elongated, or, flexible, particles, there, is, a, distinction, between, a, suspension, of, solid, particles, described, above, and, an, emulsion, the, latter, is, a, suspension, of, tiny, droplets, which, themselves, may, exhibit, internal, circulation, the, presence, of, internal, circulation, can, decrease, the, observed, effective, viscosity, and, different, theoretical, or, semi, empirical, models, must, be, used, in, the, high, and, low, temperature, limits, viscous, flow, in, amorphous, materials, e, g, in, glasses, and, melts, has, the, arrhenius, form, where, q, is, a, relevant, activation, energy, given, in, terms, of, molecular, parameters, t, is, temperature, r, is, the, molar, gas, constant, and, a, is, approximately, a, constant, the, activation, energy, q, takes, a, different, value, depending, on, whether, the, high, or, low, temperature, limit, is, being, considered, it, changes, from, a, high, value, q, h, at, low, temperatures, in, the, glassy, state, to, a, low, value, q, l, at, high, temperatures, in, the, liquid, state, for, intermediate, temperatures, q, displaystyle, q, varies, nontrivially, with, temperature, and, the, simple, arrhenius, form, fails, on, the, other, hand, the, two, exponential, equation, where, a, displaystyle, a, b, displaystyle, b, c, displaystyle, c, d, displaystyle, d, are, all, constants, provides, a, good, fit, to, experimental, data, over, the, entire, range, of, temperatures, while, at, the, same, time, reducing, to, the, correct, arrhenius, form, in, the, low, and, high, temperature, limits, this, expression, can, be, motivated, from, various, theoretical, models, of, amorphous, materials, at, the, atomic, level, a, two, exponential, equation, for, the, viscosity, can, be, derived, within, the, dyre, shoving, model, of, supercooled, liquids, where, the, arrhenius, energy, barrier, is, identified, with, the, high, frequency, shear, modulus, times, a, characteristic, shoving, volume, upon, specifying, the, temperature, dependence, of, the, shear, modulus, via, thermal, expansion, and, via, the, repulsive, part, of, the, intermolecular, potential, another, two, exponential, equation, is, retrieved, where, c, g, displaystyle, c, g, denotes, the, high, frequency, shear, modulus, of, the, material, evaluated, at, a, temperature, equal, to, the, glass, transition, temperature, t, g, displaystyle, t, g, v, c, displaystyle, v, c, is, the, so, called, shoving, volume, i, e, it, is, the, characteristic, volume, of, the, group, of, atoms, involved, in, the, shoving, event, by, which, an, atom, molecule, escapes, from, the, cage, of, nearest, neighbours, typically, on, the, order, of, the, volume, occupied, by, few, atoms, furthermore, t, displaystyle, alpha, t, is, the, thermal, expansion, coefficient, of, the, material, displaystyle, lambda, is, a, parameter, which, measures, the, steepness, of, the, power, law, rise, of, the, ascending, flank, of, the, first, peak, of, the, radial, distribution, function, and, is, quantitatively, related, to, the, repulsive, part, of, the, interatomic, potential, finally, k, b, displaystyle, k, b, denotes, the, boltzmann, constant, in, the, study, of, turbulence, in, fluids, a, common, practical, strategy, is, to, ignore, the, small, scale, vortices, or, eddies, in, the, motion, and, to, calculate, a, large, scale, motion, with, an, effective, viscosity, called, the, eddy, viscosity, which, characterizes, the, transport, and, dissipation, of, energy, in, the, smaller, scale, flow, see, large, eddy, simulation, in, contrast, to, the, viscosity, of, the, fluid, itself, which, must, be, positive, by, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, the, eddy, viscosity, can, be, negative, because, viscosity, depends, continuously, on, temperature, and, pressure, it, cannot, be, fully, characterized, by, a, finite, number, of, experimental, measurements, predictive, formulas, become, necessary, if, experimental, values, are, not, available, at, the, temperatures, and, pressures, of, interest, this, capability, is, important, for, thermophysical, simulations, in, which, the, temperature, and, pressure, of, a, fluid, can, vary, continuously, with, space, and, time, a, similar, situation, is, encountered, for, mixtures, of, pure, fluids, where, the, viscosity, depends, continuously, on, the, concentration, ratios, of, the, constituent, fluids, for, the, simplest, fluids, such, as, dilute, monatomic, gases, and, their, mixtures, ab, initio, quantum, mechanical, computations, can, accurately, predict, viscosity, in, terms, of, fundamental, atomic, constants, i, e, without, reference, to, existing, viscosity, measurements, for, the, special, case, of, dilute, helium, uncertainties, in, the, ab, initio, calculated, viscosity, are, two, order, of, magnitudes, smaller, than, uncertainties, in, experimental, values, for, slightly, more, complex, fluids, and, mixtures, at, moderate, densities, i, e, sub, critical, densities, revised, enskog, theory, can, be, used, to, predict, viscosities, with, some, accuracy, revised, enskog, theory, is, predictive, in, the, sense, that, predictions, for, viscosity, can, be, obtained, using, parameters, fitted, to, other, pure, fluid, thermodynamic, properties, or, transport, properties, thus, requiring, no, a, priori, experimental, viscosity, measurements, for, most, fluids, high, accuracy, first, principles, computations, are, not, feasible, rather, theoretical, or, empirical, expressions, must, be, fit, to, existing, viscosity, measurements, if, such, an, expression, is, fit, to, high, fidelity, data, over, a, large, range, of, temperatures, and, pressures, then, it, is, called, a, reference, correlation, for, that, fluid, reference, correlations, have, been, published, for, many, pure, fluids, a, few, examples, are, water, carbon, dioxide, ammonia, benzene, and, xenon, many, of, these, cover, temperature, and, pressure, ranges, that, encompass, gas, liquid, and, supercritical, phases, thermophysical, modeling, software, often, relies, on, reference, correlations, for, predicting, viscosity, at, user, specified, temperature, and, pressure, these, correlations, may, be, proprietary, examples, are, refprop, proprietary, and, coolprop, open, source, viscosity, can, also, be, computed, using, formulas, that, express, it, in, terms, of, the, statistics, of, individual, particle, trajectories, these, formulas, include, the, green, kubo, relations, for, the, linear, shear, viscosity, and, the, transient, time, correlation, function, expressions, derived, by, evans, and, morriss, in, 1988, the, advantage, of, these, expressions, is, that, they, are, formally, exact, and, valid, for, general, systems, the, disadvantage, is, that, they, require, detailed, knowledge, of, particle, trajectories, available, only, in, computationally, expensive, simulations, such, as, molecular, dynamics, an, accurate, model, for, interparticle, interactions, is, also, required, which, may, be, difficult, to, obtain, for, complex, molecules, observed, values, of, viscosity, vary, over, several, orders, of, magnitude, even, for, common, substances, see, the, order, of, magnitude, table, below, for, instance, a, 70, sucrose, sugar, solution, has, a, viscosity, over, 400, times, that, of, water, and, 26, 000, times, that, of, air, more, dramatically, pitch, has, been, estimated, to, have, a, viscosity, 230, billion, times, that, of, water, the, dynamic, viscosity, displaystyle, mu, of, water, is, about, 0, 89, mpa, s, at, room, temperature, 25, c, as, a, function, of, temperature, in, kelvins, the, viscosity, can, be, estimated, using, the, semi, empirical, vogel, fulcher, tammann, equation, where, a, 0, 02939, mpa, s, b, 507, 88, k, and, c, 149, 3, k, experimentally, determined, values, of, the, viscosity, are, also, given, in, the, table, below, the, values, at, 20, c, are, a, useful, reference, there, the, dynamic, viscosity, is, about, 1, cp, and, the, kinematic, viscosity, is, about, 1, cst, under, standard, atmospheric, conditions, 25, c, and, pressure, of, 1, bar, the, dynamic, viscosity, of, air, is, 18, 5, pa, s, roughly, 50, times, smaller, than, the, viscosity, of, water, at, the, same, temperature, except, at, very, high, pressure, the, viscosity, of, air, depends, mostly, on, the, temperature, among, the, many, possible, approximate, formulas, for, the, temperature, dependence, see, temperature, dependence, of, viscosity, one, is, which, is, accurate, in, the, range, 20, c, to, 400, c, for, this, formula, to, be, valid, the, temperature, must, be, given, in, kelvins, air, displaystyle, eta, text, air, then, corresponds, to, the, viscosity, in, pa, s, the, following, table, illustrates, the, range, of, viscosity, values, observed, in, common, substances, unless, otherwise, noted, a, temperature, of, 25, c, and, a, pressure, of, 1, atmosphere, are, assumed, the, values, listed, are, representative, estimates, only, as, they, do, not, account, for, measurement, uncertainties, variability, in, material, definitions, or, non, newtonian, behavior
