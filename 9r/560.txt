in, structural, geology, a, fold, is, a, stack, of, originally, planar, surfaces, such, as, sedimentary, strata, that, are, bent, or, curved, folded, during, permanent, deformation, folds, in, rocks, vary, in, size, from, microscopic, crinkles, to, mountain, sized, folds, they, occur, as, single, isolated, folds, or, in, periodic, sets, known, as, fold, trains, synsedimentary, folds, are, those, formed, during, sedimentary, deposition, folds, form, under, varied, conditions, of, stress, pore, pressure, and, temperature, gradient, as, evidenced, by, their, presence, in, soft, sediments, the, full, spectrum, of, metamorphic, rocks, and, even, as, primary, flow, structures, in, some, igneous, rocks, a, set, of, folds, distributed, on, a, regional, scale, constitutes, a, fold, belt, a, common, feature, of, orogenic, zones, folds, are, commonly, formed, by, shortening, of, existing, layers, but, may, also, be, formed, as, a, result, of, displacement, on, a, non, planar, fault, fault, bend, fold, at, the, tip, of, a, propagating, fault, fault, propagation, fold, by, differential, compaction, or, due, to, the, effects, of, a, high, level, igneous, intrusion, e, g, above, a, laccolith, the, fold, hinge, is, the, line, joining, points, of, maximum, curvature, on, a, folded, surface, this, line, may, be, either, straight, or, curved, the, term, hinge, line, has, also, been, used, for, this, feature, a, fold, surface, seen, perpendicular, to, its, shortening, direction, can, be, divided, into, hinge, and, limb, portions, the, limbs, are, the, flanks, of, the, fold, and, the, limbs, converge, at, the, hinge, zone, within, the, hinge, zone, lies, the, hinge, point, which, is, the, point, of, minimum, radius, of, curvature, maximum, curvature, of, the, fold, the, crest, of, the, fold, represents, the, highest, point, of, the, fold, surface, whereas, the, trough, is, the, lowest, point, the, inflection, point, of, a, fold, is, the, point, on, a, limb, at, which, the, concavity, reverses, on, regular, folds, this, is, the, midpoint, of, the, limb, the, axial, surface, is, defined, as, a, plane, connecting, all, the, hinge, lines, of, stacked, folded, surfaces, if, the, axial, surface, is, planar, it, is, called, an, axial, plane, and, can, be, described, in, terms, of, strike, and, dip, folds, can, have, a, fold, axis, a, fold, axis, is, the, closest, approximation, to, a, straight, line, that, when, moved, parallel, to, itself, generates, the, form, of, the, fold, ramsay, 1967, a, fold, that, can, be, generated, by, a, fold, axis, is, called, a, cylindrical, fold, this, term, has, been, broadened, to, include, near, cylindrical, folds, often, the, fold, axis, is, the, same, as, the, hinge, line, minor, folds, are, quite, frequently, seen, in, outcrop, major, folds, seldom, are, except, in, the, more, arid, countries, minor, folds, can, however, often, provide, the, key, to, the, major, folds, they, are, related, to, they, reflect, the, same, shape, and, style, the, direction, in, which, the, closures, of, the, major, folds, lie, and, their, cleavage, indicates, the, attitude, of, the, axial, planes, of, the, major, folds, and, their, direction, of, overturning, a, fold, can, be, shaped, like, a, chevron, with, planar, limbs, meeting, at, an, angular, axis, as, cuspate, with, curved, limbs, as, circular, with, a, curved, axis, or, as, elliptical, with, unequal, wavelength, fold, tightness, is, defined, by, the, size, of, the, angle, between, the, fold, s, limbs, as, measured, tangential, to, the, folded, surface, at, the, inflection, line, of, each, limb, called, the, interlimb, angle, gentle, folds, have, an, interlimb, angle, of, between, 180, and, 120, open, folds, range, from, 120, to, 70, close, folds, from, 70, to, 30, and, tight, folds, from, 30, to, 0, isoclines, or, isoclinal, folds, have, an, interlimb, angle, of, between, 10, and, zero, with, essentially, parallel, limbs, not, all, folds, are, equal, on, both, sides, of, the, axis, of, the, fold, those, with, limbs, of, relatively, equal, length, are, termed, symmetrical, and, those, with, highly, unequal, limbs, are, asymmetrical, asymmetrical, folds, generally, have, an, axis, at, an, angle, to, the, original, unfolded, surface, they, formed, on, vergence, is, calculated, in, a, direction, perpendicular, to, the, fold, axis, folds, that, maintain, uniform, layer, thickness, are, classed, as, concentric, folds, those, that, do, not, are, called, similar, folds, similar, folds, tend, to, display, thinning, of, the, limbs, and, thickening, of, the, hinge, zone, concentric, folds, are, caused, by, warping, from, active, buckling, of, the, layers, whereas, similar, folds, usually, form, by, some, form, of, shear, flow, where, the, layers, are, not, mechanically, active, ramsay, has, proposed, a, classification, scheme, for, folds, that, often, is, used, to, describe, folds, in, profile, based, upon, the, curvature, of, the, inner, and, outer, lines, of, a, fold, and, the, behavior, of, dip, isogons, that, is, lines, connecting, points, of, equal, dip, on, adjacent, folded, surfaces, a, homocline, involves, strata, dipping, in, the, same, direction, though, not, necessarily, any, folding, folds, appear, on, all, scales, in, all, rock, types, at, all, levels, in, the, crust, they, arise, from, a, variety, of, causes, when, a, sequence, of, layered, rocks, is, shortened, parallel, to, its, layering, this, deformation, may, be, accommodated, in, a, number, of, ways, homogeneous, shortening, reverse, faulting, or, folding, the, response, depends, on, the, thickness, of, the, mechanical, layering, and, the, contrast, in, properties, between, the, layers, if, the, layering, does, begin, to, fold, the, fold, style, is, also, dependent, on, these, properties, isolated, thick, competent, layers, in, a, less, competent, matrix, control, the, folding, and, typically, generate, classic, rounded, buckle, folds, accommodated, by, deformation, in, the, matrix, in, the, case, of, regular, alternations, of, layers, of, contrasting, properties, such, as, sandstone, shale, sequences, kink, bands, box, folds, and, chevron, folds, are, normally, produced, many, folds, are, directly, related, to, faults, associated, with, their, propagation, displacement, and, the, accommodation, of, strains, between, neighboring, faults, fault, bend, folds, are, caused, by, displacement, along, a, non, planar, fault, in, non, vertical, faults, the, hanging, wall, deforms, to, accommodate, the, mismatch, across, the, fault, as, displacement, progresses, fault, bend, folds, occur, in, both, extensional, and, thrust, faulting, in, extension, listric, faults, form, rollover, anticlines, in, their, hanging, walls, in, thrusting, ramp, anticlines, form, whenever, a, thrust, fault, cuts, up, section, from, one, detachment, level, to, another, displacement, over, this, higher, angle, ramp, generates, the, folding, fault, propagation, folds, or, tip, line, folds, are, caused, when, displacement, occurs, on, an, existing, fault, without, further, propagation, in, both, reverse, and, normal, faults, this, leads, to, folding, of, the, overlying, sequence, often, in, the, form, of, a, monocline, when, a, thrust, fault, continues, to, displace, above, a, planar, detachment, without, further, fault, propagation, detachment, folds, may, form, typically, of, box, fold, style, these, generally, occur, above, a, good, detachment, such, as, in, the, jura, mountains, where, the, detachment, occurs, on, middle, triassic, evaporites, shear, zones, that, approximate, to, simple, shear, typically, contain, minor, asymmetric, folds, with, the, direction, of, overturning, consistent, with, the, overall, shear, sense, some, of, these, folds, have, highly, curved, hinge, lines, and, are, referred, to, as, sheath, folds, folds, in, shear, zones, can, be, inherited, formed, due, to, the, orientation, of, pre, shearing, layering, or, formed, due, to, instability, within, the, shear, flow, recently, deposited, sediments, are, normally, mechanically, weak, and, prone, to, remobilization, before, they, become, lithified, leading, to, folding, to, distinguish, them, from, folds, of, tectonic, origin, such, structures, are, called, synsedimentary, formed, during, sedimentation, slump, folding, when, slumps, form, in, poorly, consolidated, sediments, they, commonly, undergo, folding, particularly, at, their, leading, edges, during, their, emplacement, the, asymmetry, of, the, slump, folds, can, be, used, to, determine, paleoslope, directions, in, sequences, of, sedimentary, rocks, dewatering, rapid, dewatering, of, sandy, sediments, possibly, triggered, by, seismic, activity, can, cause, convolute, bedding, compaction, folds, can, be, generated, in, a, younger, sequence, by, differential, compaction, over, older, structures, such, as, fault, blocks, and, reefs, the, emplacement, of, igneous, intrusions, tends, to, deform, the, surrounding, country, rock, in, the, case, of, high, level, intrusions, near, the, earth, s, surface, this, deformation, is, concentrated, above, the, intrusion, and, often, takes, the, form, of, folding, as, with, the, upper, surface, of, a, laccolith, the, compliance, of, rock, layers, is, referred, to, as, competence, a, competent, layer, or, bed, of, rock, can, withstand, an, applied, load, without, collapsing, and, is, relatively, strong, while, an, incompetent, layer, is, relatively, weak, when, rock, behaves, as, a, fluid, as, in, the, case, of, very, weak, rock, such, as, rock, salt, or, any, rock, that, is, buried, deeply, enough, it, typically, shows, flow, folding, also, called, passive, folding, because, little, resistance, is, offered, the, strata, appear, shifted, undistorted, assuming, any, shape, impressed, upon, them, by, surrounding, more, rigid, rocks, the, strata, simply, serve, as, markers, of, the, folding, such, folding, is, also, a, feature, of, many, igneous, intrusions, and, glacier, ice, folding, of, rocks, must, balance, the, deformation, of, layers, with, the, conservation, of, volume, in, a, rock, mass, this, occurs, by, several, mechanisms, flexural, slip, allows, folding, by, creating, layer, parallel, slip, between, the, layers, of, the, folded, strata, which, altogether, result, in, deformation, a, good, analogy, is, bending, a, phone, book, where, volume, preservation, is, accommodated, by, slip, between, the, pages, of, the, book, the, fold, formed, by, the, compression, of, competent, rock, beds, is, called, flexure, fold, typically, folding, is, thought, to, occur, by, simple, buckling, of, a, planar, surface, and, its, confining, volume, the, volume, change, is, accommodated, by, layer, parallel, shortening, the, volume, which, grows, in, thickness, folding, under, this, mechanism, is, typical, of, a, similar, fold, style, as, thinned, limbs, are, shortened, horizontally, and, thickened, hinges, do, so, vertically, if, the, folding, deformation, cannot, be, accommodated, by, a, flexural, slip, or, volume, change, shortening, buckling, the, rocks, are, generally, removed, from, the, path, of, the, stress, this, is, achieved, by, pressure, dissolution, a, form, of, metamorphic, process, in, which, rocks, shorten, by, dissolving, constituents, in, areas, of, high, strain, and, redepositing, them, in, areas, of, lower, strain, folds, generated, in, this, way, include, examples, in, migmatites, and, areas, with, a, strong, axial, planar, cleavage, folds, in, the, rock, are, formed, about, the, stress, field, in, which, the, rocks, are, located, and, the, rheology, or, method, of, response, to, stress, of, the, rock, at, the, time, at, which, the, stress, is, applied, the, rheology, of, the, layers, being, folded, determines, characteristic, features, of, the, folds, that, are, measured, in, the, field, rocks, that, deform, more, easily, form, many, short, wavelength, high, amplitude, folds, rocks, that, do, not, deform, as, easily, form, long, wavelength, low, amplitude, folds, layers, of, rock, that, fold, into, a, hinge, need, to, accommodate, large, deformations, in, the, hinge, zone, this, results, in, voids, between, the, layers, these, voids, and, especially, the, fact, that, the, water, pressure, is, lower, in, the, voids, than, outside, of, them, act, as, triggers, for, the, deposition, of, minerals, over, millions, of, years, this, process, is, capable, of, gathering, large, quantities, of, trace, minerals, from, large, expanses, of, rock, and, depositing, them, at, very, concentrated, sites, this, may, be, a, mechanism, that, is, responsible, for, the, veins, to, summarize, when, searching, for, veins, of, valuable, minerals, it, might, be, wise, to, look, for, highly, folded, rock, and, this, is, the, reason, why, the, mining, industry, is, very, interested, in, the, theory, of, geological, folding, anticlinal, traps, are, formed, by, folding, of, rock, for, example, if, a, porous, sandstone, unit, covered, with, low, permeability, shale, is, folded, into, an, anticline, it, may, form, a, hydrocarbons, trap, oil, accumulating, in, the, crest, of, the, fold, most, anticlinal, traps, are, produced, as, a, result, of, sideways, pressure, folding, the, layers, of, rock, but, can, also, occur, from, sediments, being, compacted
