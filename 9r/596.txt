limestone, calcium, carbonate, caco, 3, is, a, type, of, carbonate, sedimentary, rock, which, is, the, main, source, of, the, material, lime, it, is, composed, mostly, of, the, minerals, calcite, and, aragonite, which, are, different, crystal, forms, of, caco, 3, limestone, forms, when, these, minerals, precipitate, out, of, water, containing, dissolved, calcium, this, can, take, place, through, both, biological, and, nonbiological, processes, though, biological, processes, such, as, the, accumulation, of, corals, and, shells, in, the, sea, have, likely, been, more, important, for, the, last, 540, million, years, limestone, often, contains, fossils, which, provide, scientists, with, information, on, ancient, environments, and, on, the, evolution, of, life, about, 20, to, 25, of, sedimentary, rock, is, carbonate, rock, and, most, of, this, is, limestone, the, remaining, carbonate, rock, is, mostly, dolomite, a, closely, related, rock, which, contains, a, high, percentage, of, the, mineral, dolomite, camg, co, 3, 2, magnesian, limestone, is, an, obsolete, and, poorly, defined, term, used, variously, for, dolomite, for, limestone, containing, significant, dolomite, dolomitic, limestone, or, for, any, other, limestone, containing, a, significant, percentage, of, magnesium, most, limestone, was, formed, in, shallow, marine, environments, such, as, continental, shelves, or, platforms, though, smaller, amounts, were, formed, in, many, other, environments, much, dolomite, is, secondary, dolomite, formed, by, chemical, alteration, of, limestone, limestone, is, exposed, over, large, regions, of, the, earth, s, surface, and, because, limestone, is, slightly, soluble, in, rainwater, these, exposures, often, are, eroded, to, become, karst, landscapes, most, cave, systems, are, found, in, limestone, bedrock, limestone, has, numerous, uses, as, a, chemical, feedstock, for, the, production, of, lime, used, for, cement, an, essential, component, of, concrete, as, aggregate, for, the, base, of, roads, as, white, pigment, or, filler, in, products, such, as, toothpaste, or, paint, as, a, soil, conditioner, and, as, a, popular, decorative, addition, to, rock, gardens, limestone, formations, contain, about, 30, of, the, world, s, petroleum, reservoirs, limestone, is, composed, mostly, of, the, minerals, calcite, and, aragonite, which, are, different, crystal, forms, of, calcium, carbonate, caco, 3, dolomite, camg, co, 3, 2, is, an, uncommon, mineral, in, limestone, and, siderite, or, other, carbonate, minerals, are, rare, however, the, calcite, in, limestone, often, contains, a, few, percent, of, magnesium, calcite, in, limestone, is, divided, into, low, magnesium, and, high, magnesium, calcite, with, the, dividing, line, placed, at, a, composition, of, 4, magnesium, high, magnesium, calcite, retains, the, calcite, mineral, structure, which, is, distinct, from, dolomite, aragonite, does, not, usually, contain, significant, magnesium, most, limestone, is, otherwise, chemically, fairly, pure, with, clastic, sediments, mainly, fine, grained, quartz, and, clay, minerals, making, up, less, than, 5, to, 10, of, the, composition, organic, matter, typically, makes, up, around, 0, 2, of, a, limestone, and, rarely, exceeds, 1, limestone, often, contains, variable, amounts, of, silica, in, the, form, of, chert, or, siliceous, skeletal, fragments, such, as, sponge, spicules, diatoms, or, radiolarians, fossils, are, also, common, in, limestone, limestone, is, commonly, white, to, gray, in, color, limestone, that, is, unusually, rich, in, organic, matter, can, be, almost, black, in, color, while, traces, of, iron, or, manganese, can, give, limestone, an, off, white, to, yellow, to, red, color, the, density, of, limestone, depends, on, its, porosity, which, varies, from, 0, 1, for, the, densest, limestone, to, 40, for, chalk, the, density, correspondingly, ranges, from, 1, 5, to, 2, 7, g, cm, 3, although, relatively, soft, with, a, mohs, hardness, of, 2, to, 4, dense, limestone, can, have, a, crushing, strength, of, up, to, 180, mpa, for, comparison, concrete, typically, has, a, crushing, strength, of, about, 40, mpa, although, limestones, show, little, variability, in, mineral, composition, they, show, great, diversity, in, texture, however, most, limestone, consists, of, sand, sized, grains, in, a, carbonate, mud, matrix, because, limestones, are, often, of, biological, origin, and, are, usually, composed, of, sediment, that, is, deposited, close, to, where, it, formed, classification, of, limestone, is, usually, based, on, its, grain, type, and, mud, content, most, grains, in, limestone, are, skeletal, fragments, of, marine, organisms, such, as, coral, or, foraminifera, these, organisms, secrete, structures, made, of, aragonite, or, calcite, and, leave, these, structures, behind, when, they, die, other, carbonate, grains, composing, limestones, are, ooids, peloids, and, limeclasts, intraclasts, and, extraclasts, skeletal, grains, have, a, composition, reflecting, the, organisms, that, produced, them, and, the, environment, in, which, they, were, produced, low, magnesium, calcite, skeletal, grains, are, typical, of, articulate, brachiopods, planktonic, free, floating, foraminifera, and, coccoliths, high, magnesium, calcite, skeletal, grains, are, typical, of, benthic, bottom, dwelling, foraminifera, echinoderms, and, coralline, algae, aragonite, skeletal, grains, are, typical, of, molluscs, calcareous, green, algae, stromatoporoids, corals, and, tube, worms, the, skeletal, grains, also, reflect, specific, geological, periods, and, environments, for, example, coral, grains, are, more, common, in, high, energy, environments, characterized, by, strong, currents, and, turbulence, while, bryozoan, grains, are, more, common, in, low, energy, environments, characterized, by, quiet, water, ooids, sometimes, called, ooliths, are, sand, sized, grains, less, than, 2mm, in, diameter, consisting, of, one, or, more, layers, of, calcite, or, aragonite, around, a, central, quartz, grain, or, carbonate, mineral, fragment, these, likely, form, by, direct, precipitation, of, calcium, carbonate, onto, the, ooid, pisoliths, are, similar, to, ooids, but, they, are, larger, than, 2, mm, in, diameter, and, tend, to, be, more, irregular, in, shape, limestone, composed, mostly, of, ooids, is, called, an, oolite, or, sometimes, an, oolitic, limestone, ooids, form, in, high, energy, environments, such, as, the, bahama, platform, and, oolites, typically, show, crossbedding, and, other, features, associated, with, deposition, in, strong, currents, oncoliths, resemble, ooids, but, show, a, radial, rather, than, layered, internal, structure, indicating, that, they, were, formed, by, algae, in, a, normal, marine, environment, peloids, are, structureless, grains, of, microcrystalline, carbonate, likely, produced, by, a, variety, of, processes, many, are, thought, to, be, fecal, pellets, produced, by, marine, organisms, others, may, be, produced, by, endolithic, boring, algae, or, other, microorganisms, or, through, breakdown, of, mollusc, shells, they, are, difficult, to, see, in, a, limestone, sample, except, in, thin, section, and, are, less, common, in, ancient, limestones, possibly, because, compaction, of, carbonate, sediments, disrupts, them, limeclasts, are, fragments, of, existing, limestone, or, partially, lithified, carbonate, sediments, intraclasts, are, limeclasts, that, originate, close, to, where, they, are, deposited, in, limestone, while, extraclasts, come, from, outside, the, depositional, area, intraclasts, include, grapestone, which, is, clusters, of, peloids, cemented, together, by, organic, material, or, mineral, cement, extraclasts, are, uncommon, are, usually, accompanied, by, other, clastic, sediments, and, indicate, deposition, in, a, tectonically, active, area, or, as, part, of, a, turbidity, current, the, grains, of, most, limestones, are, embedded, in, a, matrix, of, carbonate, mud, this, is, typically, the, largest, fraction, of, an, ancient, carbonate, rock, mud, consisting, of, individual, crystals, less, than, 5, m, 0, 20, mils, in, length, is, described, as, micrite, in, fresh, carbonate, mud, micrite, is, mostly, small, aragonite, needles, which, may, precipitate, directly, from, seawater, be, secreted, by, algae, or, be, produced, by, abrasion, of, carbonate, grains, in, a, high, energy, environment, this, is, converted, to, calcite, within, a, few, million, years, of, deposition, further, recrystallization, of, micrite, produces, microspar, with, grains, from, 5, to, 15, m, 0, 20, to, 0, 59, mils, in, diameter, limestone, often, contains, larger, crystals, of, calcite, ranging, in, size, from, 0, 02, to, 0, 1, mm, 0, 79, to, 3, 94, mils, that, are, described, as, sparry, calcite, or, sparite, sparite, is, distinguished, from, micrite, by, a, grain, size, of, over, 20, m, 0, 79, mils, and, because, sparite, stands, out, under, a, hand, lens, or, in, thin, section, as, white, or, transparent, crystals, sparite, is, distinguished, from, carbonate, grains, by, its, lack, of, internal, structure, and, its, characteristic, crystal, shapes, geologists, are, careful, to, distinguish, between, sparite, deposited, as, cement, and, sparite, formed, by, recrystallization, of, micrite, or, carbonate, grains, sparite, cement, was, likely, deposited, in, pore, space, between, grains, suggesting, a, high, energy, depositional, environment, that, removed, carbonate, mud, recrystallized, sparite, is, not, diagnostic, of, depositional, environment, limestone, outcrops, are, recognized, in, the, field, by, their, softness, calcite, and, aragonite, both, have, a, mohs, hardness, of, less, than, 4, well, below, common, silicate, minerals, and, because, limestone, bubbles, vigorously, when, a, drop, of, dilute, hydrochloric, acid, is, dropped, on, it, dolomite, is, also, soft, but, reacts, only, feebly, with, dilute, hydrochloric, acid, and, it, usually, weathers, to, a, characteristic, dull, yellow, brown, color, due, to, the, presence, of, ferrous, iron, this, is, released, and, oxidized, as, the, dolomite, weathers, impurities, such, as, clay, sand, organic, remains, iron, oxide, and, other, materials, will, cause, limestones, to, exhibit, different, colors, especially, with, weathered, surfaces, the, makeup, of, a, carbonate, rock, outcrop, can, be, estimated, in, the, field, by, etching, the, surface, with, dilute, hydrochloric, acid, this, etches, away, the, calcite, and, aragonite, leaving, behind, any, silica, or, dolomite, grains, the, latter, can, be, identified, by, their, rhombohedral, shape, crystals, of, calcite, quartz, dolomite, or, barite, may, line, small, cavities, vugs, in, the, rock, vugs, are, a, form, of, secondary, porosity, formed, in, existing, limestone, by, a, change, in, environment, that, increases, the, solubility, of, calcite, dense, massive, limestone, is, sometimes, described, as, marble, for, example, the, famous, portoro, marble, of, italy, is, actually, a, dense, black, limestone, true, marble, is, produced, by, recrystallization, of, limestone, during, regional, metamorphism, that, accompanies, the, mountain, building, process, orogeny, it, is, distinguished, from, dense, limestone, by, its, coarse, crystalline, texture, and, the, formation, of, distinctive, minerals, from, the, silica, and, clay, present, in, the, original, limestone, two, major, classification, schemes, the, folk, and, dunham, are, used, for, identifying, the, types, of, carbonate, rocks, collectively, known, as, limestone, robert, l, folk, developed, a, classification, system, that, places, primary, emphasis, on, the, detailed, composition, of, grains, and, interstitial, material, in, carbonate, rocks, based, on, composition, there, are, three, main, components, allochems, grains, matrix, mostly, micrite, and, cement, sparite, the, folk, system, uses, two, part, names, the, first, refers, to, the, grains, and, the, second, to, the, cement, for, example, a, limestone, consisting, mainly, of, ooids, with, a, crystalline, matrix, would, be, termed, an, oosparite, it, is, helpful, to, have, a, petrographic, microscope, when, using, the, folk, scheme, because, it, is, easier, to, determine, the, components, present, in, each, sample, robert, j, dunham, published, his, system, for, limestone, in, 1962, it, focuses, on, the, depositional, fabric, of, carbonate, rocks, dunham, divides, the, rocks, into, four, main, groups, based, on, relative, proportions, of, coarser, clastic, particles, based, on, criteria, such, as, whether, the, grains, were, originally, in, mutual, contact, and, therefore, self, supporting, or, whether, the, rock, is, characterized, by, the, presence, of, frame, builders, and, algal, mats, unlike, the, folk, scheme, dunham, deals, with, the, original, porosity, of, the, rock, the, dunham, scheme, is, more, useful, for, hand, samples, because, it, is, based, on, texture, not, the, grains, in, the, sample, a, revised, classification, was, proposed, by, wright, 1992, it, adds, some, diagenetic, patterns, to, the, classification, scheme, travertine, is, a, term, applied, to, calcium, carbonate, deposits, formed, in, freshwater, environments, particularly, waterfalls, cascades, and, hot, springs, such, deposits, are, typically, massive, dense, and, banded, when, the, deposits, are, highly, porous, so, that, they, have, a, spongelike, texture, they, are, typically, described, as, tufa, secondary, calcite, deposited, by, supersaturated, meteoric, waters, groundwater, in, caves, is, also, sometimes, described, as, travertine, this, produces, speleothems, such, as, stalagmites, and, stalactites, coquina, is, a, poorly, consolidated, limestone, composed, of, abraded, pieces, of, coral, shells, or, other, fossil, debris, when, better, consolidated, it, is, described, as, coquinite, chalk, is, a, soft, earthy, fine, textured, limestone, composed, of, the, tests, of, planktonic, microorganisms, such, as, foraminifera, while, marl, is, an, earthy, mixture, of, carbonates, and, silicate, sediments, limestone, forms, when, calcite, or, aragonite, precipitate, out, of, water, containing, dissolved, calcium, which, can, take, place, through, both, biological, and, nonbiological, processes, the, solubility, of, calcium, carbonate, caco, 3, is, controlled, largely, by, the, amount, of, dissolved, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, in, the, water, this, is, summarized, in, the, reaction, increases, in, temperature, or, decreases, in, pressure, tend, to, reduce, the, amount, of, dissolved, co, 2, and, precipitate, caco, 3, reduction, in, salinity, also, reduces, the, solubility, of, caco, 3, by, several, orders, of, magnitude, for, fresh, water, versus, seawater, near, surface, water, of, the, earth, s, oceans, are, oversaturated, with, caco, 3, by, a, factor, of, more, than, six, the, failure, of, caco, 3, to, rapidly, precipitate, out, of, these, waters, is, likely, due, to, interference, by, dissolved, magnesium, ions, with, nucleation, of, calcite, crystals, the, necessary, first, step, in, precipitation, precipitation, of, aragonite, may, be, suppressed, by, the, presence, of, naturally, occurring, organic, phosphates, in, the, water, although, ooids, likely, form, through, purely, inorganic, processes, the, bulk, of, caco, 3, precipitation, in, the, oceans, is, the, result, of, biological, activity, much, of, this, takes, place, on, carbonate, platforms, the, origin, of, carbonate, mud, and, the, processes, by, which, it, is, converted, to, micrite, continue, to, be, a, subject, of, research, modern, carbonate, mud, is, composed, mostly, of, aragonite, needles, around, 5, m, 0, 20, mils, in, length, needles, of, this, shape, and, composition, are, produced, by, calcareous, algae, such, as, penicillus, making, this, a, plausible, source, of, mud, another, possibility, is, direct, precipitation, from, the, water, a, phenomenon, known, as, whitings, occurs, in, shallow, waters, in, which, white, streaks, containing, dispersed, micrite, appear, on, the, surface, of, the, water, it, is, uncertain, whether, this, is, freshly, precipitated, aragonite, or, simply, material, stirred, up, from, the, bottom, but, there, is, some, evidence, that, whitings, are, caused, by, biological, precipitation, of, aragonite, as, part, of, a, bloom, of, cyanobacteria, or, microalgae, however, stable, isotope, ratios, in, modern, carbonate, mud, appear, to, be, inconsistent, with, either, of, these, mechanisms, and, abrasion, of, carbonate, grains, in, high, energy, environments, has, been, put, forward, as, a, third, possibility, formation, of, limestone, has, likely, been, dominated, by, biological, processes, throughout, the, phanerozoic, the, last, 540, million, years, of, the, earth, s, history, limestone, may, have, been, deposited, by, microorganisms, in, the, precambrian, prior, to, 540, million, years, ago, but, inorganic, processes, were, probably, more, important, and, likely, took, place, in, an, ocean, more, highly, oversaturated, in, calcium, carbonate, than, the, modern, ocean, diagenesis, is, the, process, in, which, sediments, are, compacted, and, turned, into, solid, rock, during, diagenesis, of, carbonate, sediments, significant, chemical, and, textural, changes, take, place, for, example, aragonite, is, converted, to, low, magnesium, calcite, diagenesis, is, the, likely, origin, of, pisoliths, concentrically, layered, particles, ranging, from, 1, to, 10, mm, 0, 039, to, 0, 394, inches, in, diameter, found, in, some, limestones, pisoliths, superficially, resemble, ooids, but, have, no, nucleus, of, foreign, matter, fit, together, tightly, and, show, other, signs, that, they, formed, after, the, original, deposition, of, the, sediments, silicification, occurs, early, in, diagenesis, at, low, ph, and, temperature, and, contributes, to, fossil, preservation, silicification, takes, place, through, the, reaction, fossils, are, often, preserved, in, exquisite, detail, as, chert, cementing, takes, place, rapidly, in, carbonate, sediments, typically, within, less, than, a, million, years, of, deposition, some, cementing, occurs, while, the, sediments, are, still, under, water, forming, hardgrounds, cementing, accelerates, after, the, retreat, of, the, sea, from, the, depositional, environment, as, rainwater, infiltrates, the, sediment, beds, often, within, just, a, few, thousand, years, as, rainwater, mixes, with, groundwater, aragonite, and, high, magnesium, calcite, are, converted, to, low, calcium, calcite, cementing, of, thick, carbonate, deposits, by, rainwater, may, commence, even, before, the, retreat, of, the, sea, as, rainwater, can, infiltrate, over, 100, km, 60, miles, into, sediments, beneath, the, continental, shelf, as, carbonate, sediments, are, increasingly, deeply, buried, under, younger, sediments, chemical, and, mechanical, compaction, of, the, sediments, increases, chemical, compaction, takes, place, by, pressure, solution, of, the, sediments, this, process, dissolves, minerals, from, points, of, contact, between, grains, and, redeposits, it, in, pore, space, reducing, the, porosity, of, the, limestone, from, an, initial, high, value, of, 40, to, 80, to, less, than, 10, pressure, solution, produces, distinctive, stylolites, irregular, surfaces, within, the, limestone, at, which, silica, rich, sediments, accumulate, these, may, reflect, dissolution, and, loss, of, a, considerable, fraction, of, the, limestone, bed, at, depths, greater, than, 1, km, 0, 62, miles, burial, cementation, completes, the, lithification, process, burial, cementation, does, not, produce, stylolites, when, overlying, beds, are, eroded, bringing, limestone, closer, to, the, surface, the, final, stage, of, diagenesis, takes, place, this, produces, secondary, porosity, as, some, of, the, cement, is, dissolved, by, rainwater, infiltrating, the, beds, this, may, include, the, formation, of, vugs, which, are, crystal, lined, cavities, within, the, limestone, diagenesis, may, include, conversion, of, limestone, to, dolomite, by, magnesium, rich, fluids, there, is, considerable, evidence, of, replacement, of, limestone, by, dolomite, including, sharp, replacement, boundaries, that, cut, across, bedding, the, process, of, dolomitization, remains, an, area, of, active, research, but, possible, mechanisms, include, exposure, to, concentrated, brines, in, hot, environments, evaporative, reflux, or, exposure, to, diluted, seawater, in, delta, or, estuary, environments, dorag, dolomitization, however, dorag, dolomitization, has, fallen, into, disfavor, as, a, mechanism, for, dolomitization, with, one, 2004, review, paper, describing, it, bluntly, as, a, myth, ordinary, seawater, is, capable, of, converting, calcite, to, dolomite, if, the, seawater, is, regularly, flushed, through, the, rock, as, by, the, ebb, and, flow, of, tides, tidal, pumping, once, dolomitization, begins, it, proceeds, rapidly, so, that, there, is, very, little, carbonate, rock, containing, mixed, calcite, and, dolomite, carbonate, rock, tends, to, be, either, almost, all, calcite, aragonite, or, almost, all, dolomite, about, 20, to, 25, of, sedimentary, rock, is, carbonate, rock, and, most, of, this, is, limestone, limestone, is, found, in, sedimentary, sequences, as, old, as, 2, 7, billion, years, however, the, compositions, of, carbonate, rocks, show, an, uneven, distribution, in, time, in, the, geologic, record, about, 95, of, modern, carbonates, are, composed, of, high, magnesium, calcite, and, aragonite, the, aragonite, needles, in, carbonate, mud, are, converted, to, low, magnesium, calcite, within, a, few, million, years, as, this, is, the, most, stable, form, of, calcium, carbonate, ancient, carbonate, formations, of, the, precambrian, and, paleozoic, contain, abundant, dolomite, but, limestone, dominates, the, carbonate, beds, of, the, mesozoic, and, cenozoic, modern, dolomite, is, quite, rare, there, is, evidence, that, while, the, modern, ocean, favors, precipitation, of, aragonite, the, oceans, of, the, paleozoic, and, middle, to, late, cenozoic, favored, precipitation, of, calcite, this, may, indicate, a, lower, mg, ca, ratio, in, the, ocean, water, of, those, times, this, magnesium, depletion, may, be, a, consequence, of, more, rapid, sea, floor, spreading, which, removes, magnesium, from, ocean, water, the, modern, ocean, and, the, ocean, of, the, mesozoic, have, been, described, as, aragonite, seas, most, limestone, was, formed, in, shallow, marine, environments, such, as, continental, shelves, or, platforms, such, environments, form, only, about, 5, of, the, ocean, basins, but, limestone, is, rarely, preserved, in, continental, slope, and, deep, sea, environments, the, best, environments, for, deposition, are, warm, waters, which, have, both, a, high, organic, productivity, and, increased, saturation, of, calcium, carbonate, due, to, lower, concentrations, of, dissolved, carbon, dioxide, modern, limestone, deposits, are, almost, always, in, areas, with, very, little, silica, rich, sedimentation, reflected, in, the, relative, purity, of, most, limestones, reef, organisms, are, destroyed, by, muddy, brackish, river, water, and, carbonate, grains, are, ground, down, by, much, harder, silicate, grains, unlike, clastic, sedimentary, rock, limestone, is, produced, almost, entirely, from, sediments, originating, at, or, near, the, place, of, deposition, limestone, formations, tend, to, show, abrupt, changes, in, thickness, large, moundlike, features, in, a, limestone, formation, are, interpreted, as, ancient, reefs, which, when, they, appear, in, the, geologic, record, are, called, bioherms, many, are, rich, in, fossils, but, most, lack, any, connected, organic, framework, like, that, seen, in, modern, reefs, the, fossil, remains, are, present, as, separate, fragments, embedded, in, ample, mud, matrix, much, of, the, sedimentation, shows, indications, of, occurring, in, the, intertidal, or, supratidal, zones, suggesting, sediments, rapidly, fill, available, accommodation, space, in, the, shelf, or, platform, deposition, is, also, favored, on, the, seaward, margin, of, shelves, and, platforms, where, there, is, upwelling, deep, ocean, water, rich, in, nutrients, that, increase, organic, productivity, reefs, are, common, here, but, when, lacking, ooid, shoals, are, found, instead, finer, sediments, are, deposited, close, to, shore, the, lack, of, deep, sea, limestones, is, due, in, part, to, rapid, subduction, of, oceanic, crust, but, is, more, a, result, of, dissolution, of, calcium, carbonate, at, depth, the, solubility, of, calcium, carbonate, increases, with, pressure, and, even, more, with, higher, concentrations, of, carbon, dioxide, which, is, produced, by, decaying, organic, matter, settling, into, the, deep, ocean, that, is, not, removed, by, photosynthesis, in, the, dark, depths, as, a, result, there, is, a, fairly, sharp, transition, from, water, saturated, with, calcium, carbonate, to, water, unsaturated, with, calcium, carbonate, the, lysocline, which, occurs, at, the, calcite, compensation, depth, of, 4, 000, to, 7, 000, m, 13, 000, to, 23, 000, feet, below, this, depth, foraminifera, tests, and, other, skeletal, particles, rapidly, dissolve, and, the, sediments, of, the, ocean, floor, abruptly, transition, from, carbonate, ooze, rich, in, foraminifera, and, coccolith, remains, globigerina, ooze, to, silicic, mud, lacking, carbonates, in, rare, cases, turbidites, or, other, silica, rich, sediments, bury, and, preserve, benthic, deep, ocean, carbonate, deposits, ancient, benthic, limestones, are, microcrystalline, and, are, identified, by, their, tectonic, setting, fossils, typically, are, foraminifera, and, coccoliths, no, pre, jurassic, benthic, limestones, are, known, probably, because, carbonate, shelled, plankton, had, not, yet, evolved, limestones, also, form, in, freshwater, environments, these, limestones, are, not, unlike, marine, limestone, but, have, a, lower, diversity, of, organisms, and, a, greater, fraction, of, silica, and, clay, minerals, characteristic, of, marls, the, green, river, formation, is, an, example, of, a, prominent, freshwater, sedimentary, formation, containing, numerous, limestone, beds, freshwater, limestone, is, typically, micritic, fossils, of, charophyte, stonewort, a, form, of, freshwater, green, algae, are, characteristic, of, these, environments, where, the, charophytes, produce, and, trap, carbonates, limestones, may, also, form, in, evaporite, depositional, environments, calcite, is, one, of, the, first, minerals, to, precipitate, in, marine, evaporites, most, limestone, is, formed, by, the, activities, of, living, organisms, near, reefs, but, the, organisms, responsible, for, reef, formation, have, changed, over, geologic, time, for, example, stromatolites, are, mound, shaped, structures, in, ancient, limestones, interpreted, as, colonies, of, cyanobacteria, that, accumulated, carbonate, sediments, but, stromatolites, are, rare, in, younger, limestones, organisms, precipitate, limestone, both, directly, as, part, of, their, skeletons, and, indirectly, by, removing, carbon, dioxide, from, the, water, by, photosynthesis, and, thereby, decreasing, the, solubility, of, calcium, carbonate, limestone, shows, the, same, range, of, sedimentary, structures, found, in, other, sedimentary, rocks, however, finer, structures, such, as, lamination, are, often, destroyed, by, the, burrowing, activities, of, organisms, bioturbation, fine, lamination, is, characteristic, of, limestone, formed, in, playa, lakes, which, lack, the, burrowing, organisms, limestones, also, show, distinctive, features, such, as, geopetal, structures, which, form, when, curved, shells, settle, to, the, bottom, with, the, concave, face, downwards, this, traps, a, void, space, that, can, later, be, filled, by, sparite, geologists, use, geopetal, structures, to, determine, which, direction, was, up, at, the, time, of, deposition, which, is, not, always, obvious, with, highly, deformed, limestone, formations, the, cyanobacterium, hyella, balani, can, bore, through, limestone, as, can, the, green, alga, eugamantia, sacculata, and, the, fungus, ostracolaba, implexa, micricitic, mud, mounds, are, subcircular, domes, of, micritic, calcite, that, lacks, internal, structure, modern, examples, are, up, to, several, hundred, meters, thick, and, a, kilometer, across, and, have, steep, slopes, with, slope, angles, of, around, 50, degrees, they, may, be, composed, of, peloids, swept, together, by, currents, and, stabilized, by, thalassia, grass, or, mangroves, bryozoa, may, also, contribute, to, mound, formation, by, helping, to, trap, sediments, mud, mounds, are, found, throughout, the, geologic, record, and, prior, to, the, early, ordovician, they, were, the, dominant, reef, type, in, both, deep, and, shallow, water, these, mud, mounds, likely, are, microbial, in, origin, following, the, appearance, of, frame, building, reef, organisms, mud, mounds, were, restricted, mainly, to, deeper, water, organic, reefs, form, at, low, latitudes, in, shallow, water, not, more, than, a, few, meters, deep, they, are, complex, diverse, structures, found, throughout, the, fossil, record, the, frame, building, organisms, responsible, for, organic, reef, formation, are, characteristic, of, different, geologic, time, periods, archaeocyathids, appeared, in, the, early, cambrian, these, gave, way, to, sponges, by, the, late, cambrian, later, successions, included, stromatoporoids, corals, algae, bryozoa, and, rudists, a, form, of, bivalve, mollusc, the, extent, of, organic, reefs, has, varied, over, geologic, time, and, they, were, likely, most, extensive, in, the, middle, devonian, when, they, covered, an, area, estimated, at, 5, 000, 000, km, 2, 1, 900, 000, sq, mi, this, is, roughly, ten, times, the, extent, of, modern, reefs, the, devonian, reefs, were, constructed, largely, by, stromatoporoids, and, tabulate, corals, which, were, devastated, by, the, late, devonian, extinction, organic, reefs, typically, have, a, complex, internal, structure, whole, body, fossils, are, usually, abundant, but, ooids, and, interclasts, are, rare, within, the, reef, the, core, of, a, reef, is, typically, massive, and, unbedded, and, is, surrounded, by, a, talus, that, is, greater, in, volume, than, the, core, the, talus, contains, abundant, intraclasts, and, is, usually, either, floatstone, with, 10, or, more, of, grains, over, 2mm, in, size, embedded, in, abundant, matrix, or, rudstone, which, is, mostly, large, grains, with, sparse, matrix, the, talus, grades, to, planktonic, fine, grained, carbonate, mud, then, noncarbonate, mud, away, from, the, reef, limestone, is, partially, soluble, especially, in, acid, and, therefore, forms, many, erosional, landforms, these, include, limestone, pavements, pot, holes, cenotes, caves, and, gorges, such, erosion, landscapes, are, known, as, karsts, limestone, is, less, resistant, to, erosion, than, most, igneous, rocks, but, more, resistant, than, most, other, sedimentary, rocks, it, is, therefore, usually, associated, with, hills, and, downland, and, occurs, in, regions, with, other, sedimentary, rocks, typically, clays, karst, regions, overlying, limestone, bedrock, tend, to, have, fewer, visible, above, ground, sources, ponds, and, streams, as, surface, water, easily, drains, downward, through, joints, in, the, limestone, while, draining, water, and, organic, acid, from, the, soil, slowly, over, thousands, or, millions, of, years, enlarges, these, cracks, dissolving, the, calcium, carbonate, and, carrying, it, away, in, solution, most, cave, systems, are, through, limestone, bedrock, cooling, groundwater, or, mixing, of, different, groundwaters, will, also, create, conditions, suitable, for, cave, formation, coastal, limestones, are, often, eroded, by, organisms, which, bore, into, the, rock, by, various, means, this, process, is, known, as, bioerosion, it, is, most, common, in, the, tropics, and, it, is, known, throughout, the, fossil, record, bands, of, limestone, emerge, from, the, earth, s, surface, in, often, spectacular, rocky, outcrops, and, islands, examples, include, the, rock, of, gibraltar, the, burren, in, county, clare, ireland, malham, cove, in, north, yorkshire, and, the, isle, of, wight, england, the, great, orme, in, wales, on, f, r, near, the, swedish, island, of, gotland, the, niagara, escarpment, in, canada, united, states, notch, peak, in, utah, the, ha, long, bay, national, park, in, vietnam, and, the, hills, around, the, lijiang, river, and, guilin, city, in, china, the, florida, keys, islands, off, the, south, coast, of, florida, are, composed, mainly, of, oolitic, limestone, the, lower, keys, and, the, carbonate, skeletons, of, coral, reefs, the, upper, keys, which, thrived, in, the, area, during, interglacial, periods, when, sea, level, was, higher, than, at, present, unique, habitats, are, found, on, alvars, extremely, level, expanses, of, limestone, with, thin, soil, mantles, the, largest, such, expanse, in, europe, is, the, stora, alvaret, on, the, island, of, land, sweden, another, area, with, large, quantities, of, limestone, is, the, island, of, gotland, sweden, huge, quarries, in, northwestern, europe, such, as, those, of, mount, saint, peter, belgium, netherlands, extend, for, more, than, a, hundred, kilometers, limestone, is, a, raw, material, that, is, used, globally, in, a, variety, of, different, ways, including, construction, agriculture, and, as, industrial, materials, limestone, is, very, common, in, architecture, especially, in, europe, and, north, america, many, landmarks, across, the, world, including, the, great, pyramid, and, its, associated, complex, in, giza, egypt, were, made, of, limestone, so, many, buildings, in, kingston, ontario, canada, were, and, continue, to, be, constructed, from, it, that, it, is, nicknamed, the, limestone, city, limestone, metamorphosed, by, heat, and, pressure, produces, marble, which, has, been, used, for, many, statues, buildings, and, stone, tabletops, on, the, island, of, malta, a, variety, of, limestone, called, globigerina, limestone, was, for, a, long, time, the, only, building, material, available, and, is, still, very, frequently, used, on, all, types, of, buildings, and, sculptures, limestone, can, be, processed, into, many, various, forms, such, as, brick, cement, powdered, crushed, or, as, a, filler, limestone, is, readily, available, and, relatively, easy, to, cut, into, blocks, or, more, elaborate, carving, ancient, american, sculptors, valued, limestone, because, it, was, easy, to, work, and, good, for, fine, detail, going, back, to, the, late, preclassic, period, by, 200, 100, bce, the, maya, civilization, ancient, mexico, created, refined, sculpture, using, limestone, because, of, these, excellent, carving, properties, the, maya, would, decorate, the, ceilings, of, their, sacred, buildings, known, as, lintels, and, cover, the, walls, with, carved, limestone, panels, carved, on, these, sculptures, were, political, and, social, stories, and, this, helped, communicate, messages, of, the, king, to, his, people, limestone, is, long, lasting, and, stands, up, well, to, exposure, which, explains, why, many, limestone, ruins, survive, however, it, is, very, heavy, density, 2, 6, making, it, impractical, for, tall, buildings, and, relatively, expensive, as, a, building, material, limestone, was, most, popular, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, railway, stations, banks, and, other, structures, from, that, era, were, made, of, limestone, in, some, areas, it, is, used, as, a, fa, ade, on, some, skyscrapers, but, only, in, thin, plates, for, covering, rather, than, solid, blocks, in, the, united, states, indiana, most, notably, the, bloomington, area, has, long, been, a, source, of, high, quality, quarried, limestone, called, indiana, limestone, many, famous, buildings, in, london, are, built, from, portland, limestone, houses, built, in, odesa, in, ukraine, in, the, 19th, century, were, mostly, constructed, from, limestone, and, the, extensive, remains, of, the, mines, now, form, the, odesa, catacombs, limestone, was, also, a, very, popular, building, block, in, the, middle, ages, in, the, areas, where, it, occurred, since, it, is, hard, durable, and, commonly, occurs, in, easily, accessible, surface, exposures, many, medieval, churches, and, castles, in, europe, are, made, of, limestone, beer, stone, was, a, popular, kind, of, limestone, for, medieval, buildings, in, southern, england, limestone, is, the, raw, material, for, production, of, lime, primarily, known, for, treating, soils, purifying, water, and, smelting, copper, lime, is, an, important, ingredient, used, in, chemical, industries, limestone, and, to, a, lesser, extent, marble, are, reactive, to, acid, solutions, making, acid, rain, a, significant, problem, to, the, preservation, of, artifacts, made, from, this, stone, many, limestone, statues, and, building, surfaces, have, suffered, severe, damage, due, to, acid, rain, likewise, limestone, gravel, has, been, used, to, protect, lakes, vulnerable, to, acid, rain, acting, as, a, ph, buffering, agent, acid, based, cleaning, chemicals, can, also, etch, limestone, which, should, only, be, cleaned, with, a, neutral, or, mild, alkali, based, cleaner, other, uses, include, many, limestone, formations, are, porous, and, permeable, which, makes, them, important, petroleum, reservoirs, about, 20, of, north, american, hydrocarbon, reserves, are, found, in, carbonate, rock, carbonate, reservoirs, are, very, common, in, the, petroleum, rich, middle, east, and, carbonate, reservoirs, hold, about, a, third, of, all, petroleum, reserves, worldwide, limestone, formations, are, also, common, sources, of, metal, ores, because, their, porosity, and, permeability, together, with, their, chemical, activity, promotes, ore, deposition, in, the, limestone, the, lead, zinc, deposits, of, missouri, and, the, northwest, territories, are, examples, of, ore, deposits, hosted, in, limestone, limestone, is, a, major, industrial, raw, material, that, is, in, constant, demand, this, raw, material, has, been, essential, in, the, iron, and, steel, industry, since, the, nineteenth, century, companies, have, never, had, a, shortage, of, limestone, however, it, has, become, a, concern, as, the, demand, continues, to, increase, and, it, remains, in, high, demand, today, the, major, potential, threats, to, supply, in, the, nineteenth, century, were, regional, availability, and, accessibility, the, two, main, accessibility, issues, were, transportation, and, property, rights, other, problems, were, high, capital, costs, on, plants, and, facilities, due, to, environmental, regulations, and, the, requirement, of, zoning, and, mining, permits, these, two, dominant, factors, led, to, the, adaptation, and, selection, of, other, materials, that, were, created, and, formed, to, design, alternatives, for, limestone, that, suited, economic, demands, limestone, was, classified, as, a, critical, raw, material, and, with, the, potential, risk, of, shortages, it, drove, industries, to, find, new, alternative, materials, and, technological, systems, this, allowed, limestone, to, no, longer, be, classified, as, critical, as, replacement, substances, increased, in, production, minette, ore, is, a, common, substitute, for, example, powdered, limestone, as, a, food, additive, is, generally, recognized, as, safe, and, limestone, is, not, regarded, as, a, hazardous, material, however, limestone, dust, can, be, a, mild, respiratory, and, skin, irritant, and, dust, that, gets, into, the, eyes, can, cause, corneal, abrasions, because, limestone, contains, small, amounts, of, silica, inhalation, of, limestone, dust, could, potentially, lead, to, silicosis, or, cancer, the, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, osha, has, set, the, legal, limit, permissible, exposure, limit, for, limestone, exposure, in, the, workplace, as, 15, mg, m, 3, 0, 0066, gr, cu, ft, total, exposure, and, 5, mg, m, 3, 0, 0022, gr, cu, ft, respiratory, exposure, over, an, 8, hour, workday, the, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, niosh, has, set, a, recommended, exposure, limit, rel, of, 10, mg, m, 3, 0, 0044, gr, cu, ft, total, exposure, and, 5, mg, m, 3, 0, 0022, gr, cu, ft, respiratory, exposure, over, an, 8, hour, workday, removing, graffiti, from, weathered, limestone, is, difficult, because, it, is, a, porous, and, permeable, material, the, surface, is, fragile, so, usual, abrasion, methods, run, the, risk, of, severe, surface, loss, because, it, is, an, acid, sensitive, stone, some, cleaning, agents, cannot, be, used, due, to, adverse, effects
