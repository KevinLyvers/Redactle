a, radio, galaxy, is, a, galaxy, with, giant, regions, of, radio, emission, extending, well, beyond, its, visible, structure, these, energetic, radio, lobes, are, powered, by, jets, from, its, active, galactic, nucleus, they, have, luminosities, up, to, 10, 39, w, at, radio, wavelengths, between, 10, mhz, and, 100, ghz, the, radio, emission, is, due, to, the, synchrotron, process, the, observed, structure, in, radio, emission, is, determined, by, the, interaction, between, twin, jets, and, the, external, medium, modified, by, the, effects, of, relativistic, beaming, the, host, galaxies, are, almost, exclusively, large, elliptical, galaxies, radio, loud, active, galaxies, can, be, detected, at, large, distances, making, them, valuable, tools, for, observational, cosmology, recently, much, work, has, been, done, on, the, effects, of, these, objects, on, the, intergalactic, medium, particularly, in, galaxy, groups, and, clusters, a, giant, radio, galaxy, is, a, special, class, of, objects, characterized, by, the, presence, of, radio, lobes, generated, by, relativistic, jets, powered, by, the, central, galaxy, s, supermassive, black, hole, giant, radio, galaxies, are, different, from, ordinary, radio, galaxies, in, that, they, can, extend, to, much, larger, scales, reaching, upwards, to, several, megaparsecs, across, far, larger, than, the, diameters, of, their, host, galaxies, the, radio, emission, from, radio, loud, active, galaxies, is, synchrotron, emission, as, inferred, from, its, very, smooth, broad, band, nature, and, strong, polarization, this, implies, that, the, radio, emitting, plasma, contains, at, least, electrons, with, relativistic, speeds, lorentz, factors, of, 10, 4, and, magnetic, fields, since, the, plasma, must, be, neutral, it, must, also, contain, either, protons, or, positrons, there, is, no, way, of, determining, the, particle, content, directly, from, observations, of, synchrotron, radiation, moreover, there, is, no, way, to, determine, the, energy, densities, in, particles, and, magnetic, fields, from, observation, the, same, synchrotron, emissivity, may, be, a, result, of, a, few, electrons, and, a, strong, field, or, a, weak, field, and, many, electrons, or, something, in, between, it, is, possible, to, determine, a, minimum, energy, condition, which, is, the, minimum, energy, density, that, a, region, with, a, given, emissivity, can, have, but, for, many, years, there, was, no, particular, reason, to, believe, that, the, true, energies, were, anywhere, near, the, minimum, energies, a, sister, process, to, the, synchrotron, radiation, is, the, inverse, compton, process, in, which, the, relativistic, electrons, interact, with, ambient, photons, and, thomson, scatter, them, to, high, energies, inverse, compton, emission, from, radio, loud, sources, turns, out, to, be, particularly, important, in, x, rays, and, because, it, depends, only, on, the, density, of, electrons, a, detection, of, inverse, compton, scattering, allows, a, somewhat, model, dependent, estimate, of, the, energy, densities, in, the, particles, and, magnetic, fields, this, has, been, used, to, argue, that, many, powerful, sources, are, actually, quite, near, the, minimum, energy, condition, synchrotron, radiation, is, not, confined, to, radio, wavelengths, if, the, radio, source, can, accelerate, particles, to, high, enough, energies, features, that, are, detected, in, the, radio, wavelengths, may, also, be, seen, in, the, infrared, optical, ultraviolet, or, even, x, ray, in, the, latter, case, the, responsible, electrons, must, have, energies, in, excess, of, 1, tev, in, typical, magnetic, field, strengths, again, polarization, and, continuum, spectrum, are, used, to, distinguish, the, synchrotron, radiation, from, other, emission, processes, jets, and, hotspots, are, the, usual, sources, of, high, frequency, synchrotron, emission, it, is, hard, to, distinguish, observationally, between, the, synchrotron, and, inverse, compton, radiation, making, them, a, subject, of, ongoing, research, processes, collectively, known, as, particle, acceleration, produce, populations, of, relativistic, and, non, thermal, particles, that, give, rise, to, synchrotron, and, inverse, compton, radiation, fermi, acceleration, is, one, plausible, particle, acceleration, process, in, radio, loud, active, galaxies, radio, galaxies, and, to, a, lesser, extent, radio, loud, quasars, display, a, wide, range, of, structures, in, radio, maps, the, most, common, large, scale, structures, are, called, lobes, these, are, double, often, fairly, symmetrical, roughly, ellipsoidal, structures, placed, on, either, side, of, the, active, nucleus, a, significant, minority, of, low, luminosity, sources, exhibit, structures, usually, known, as, plumes, which, are, much, more, elongated, some, radio, galaxies, show, one, or, two, long, narrow, features, known, as, jets, the, most, famous, example, being, the, giant, galaxy, m87, in, the, virgo, cluster, coming, directly, from, the, nucleus, and, going, to, the, lobes, since, the, 1970s, the, most, widely, accepted, model, has, been, that, the, lobes, or, plumes, are, powered, by, beams, of, high, energy, particles, and, magnetic, field, coming, from, close, to, the, active, nucleus, the, jets, are, believed, to, be, the, visible, manifestations, of, the, beams, and, often, the, term, jet, is, used, to, refer, both, to, the, observable, feature, and, to, the, underlying, flow, in, 1974, radio, sources, were, divided, by, bernard, fanaroff, and, julia, riley, into, two, classes, now, known, as, fanaroff, and, riley, class, i, fri, and, class, ii, frii, the, distinction, was, originally, made, based, on, the, morphology, of, the, large, scale, radio, emission, the, type, was, determined, by, the, distance, between, the, brightest, points, in, the, radio, emission, fri, sources, were, brightest, towards, the, centre, while, frii, sources, were, brightest, at, the, edges, fanaroff, and, riley, observed, that, there, was, a, reasonably, sharp, divide, in, luminosity, between, the, two, classes, fris, were, low, luminosity, friis, were, high, luminosity, with, more, detailed, radio, observations, the, morphology, turns, out, to, reflect, the, method, of, energy, transport, in, the, radio, source, fri, objects, typically, have, bright, jets, in, the, centre, while, friis, have, faint, jets, but, bright, hotspots, at, the, ends, of, the, lobes, friis, appear, to, be, able, to, transport, energy, efficiently, to, the, ends, of, the, lobes, while, fri, beams, are, inefficient, in, the, sense, that, they, radiate, a, significant, amount, of, their, energy, away, as, they, travel, in, more, detail, the, fri, frii, division, depends, on, host, galaxy, environment, in, the, sense, that, the, fri, frii, transition, appears, at, higher, luminosities, in, more, massive, galaxies, fri, jets, are, known, to, be, decelerating, in, the, regions, in, which, their, radio, emission, is, brightest, and, so, it, seems, that, the, fri, frii, transition, reflects, whether, a, jet, beam, can, propagate, through, the, host, galaxy, without, being, decelerated, to, sub, relativistic, speeds, by, interaction, with, the, intergalactic, medium, from, analysis, of, relativistic, beaming, effects, the, jets, of, frii, sources, are, known, to, remain, relativistic, with, speeds, of, at, least, 0, 5c, out, to, the, ends, of, the, lobes, the, hotspots, that, are, usually, seen, in, frii, sources, are, interpreted, as, being, the, visible, manifestations, of, shocks, formed, when, the, supersonic, jet, abruptly, terminates, at, the, end, of, the, source, and, their, spectral, energy, distributions, are, consistent, with, this, picture, often, multiple, hotspots, are, seen, reflecting, either, continued, outflow, after, the, shock, or, movement, of, the, jet, termination, point, the, overall, hotspot, region, is, sometimes, called, the, hotspot, complex, names, are, given, to, several, particular, types, of, radio, source, based, on, their, radio, structure, the, largest, radio, galaxies, have, lobes, or, plumes, extending, to, megaparsec, scales, more, in, the, case, of, giant, radio, galaxies, like, 3c236, implying, a, timescale, for, growth, of, the, order, of, tens, to, hundreds, of, millions, of, years, this, means, that, except, in, the, case, of, very, small, very, young, sources, we, cannot, observe, radio, source, dynamics, directly, and, so, must, resort, to, theory, and, inferences, from, large, numbers, of, objects, clearly, radio, sources, must, start, small, and, grow, larger, in, the, case, of, sources, with, lobes, the, dynamics, are, fairly, simple, the, jets, feed, the, lobes, the, pressure, of, the, lobes, increases, and, the, lobes, expand, how, fast, they, expand, depends, on, the, density, and, pressure, of, the, external, medium, the, highest, pressure, phase, of, the, external, medium, and, thus, the, most, important, phase, from, the, point, of, view, of, the, dynamics, is, the, x, ray, emitting, diffuse, hot, gas, for, a, long, time, it, was, assumed, that, powerful, sources, would, expand, supersonically, pushing, a, shock, through, the, external, medium, however, x, ray, observations, show, that, the, internal, lobe, pressures, of, powerful, frii, sources, are, often, close, to, the, external, thermal, pressures, and, not, much, higher, than, the, external, pressures, as, would, be, required, for, supersonic, expansion, the, only, unambiguously, supersonically, expanding, system, known, consists, of, the, inner, lobes, of, the, low, power, radio, galaxy, centaurus, a, which, are, probably, a, result, of, a, comparatively, recent, outburst, of, the, active, nucleus, these, radio, sources, are, almost, universally, found, hosted, by, elliptical, galaxies, though, there, is, one, well, documented, exception, namely, ngc, 4151, some, seyfert, galaxies, show, weak, small, radio, jets, but, they, are, not, radio, luminous, enough, to, be, classified, as, radio, loud, such, information, as, there, is, about, the, host, galaxies, of, radio, loud, quasars, and, blazars, suggests, that, they, are, also, hosted, by, elliptical, galaxies, there, are, several, possible, reasons, for, this, very, strong, preference, for, ellipticals, one, is, that, ellipticals, generally, contain, the, most, massive, black, holes, and, so, are, capable, of, powering, the, most, luminous, active, galaxies, see, eddington, luminosity, another, is, that, ellipticals, generally, inhabit, richer, environments, providing, a, large, scale, intergalactic, medium, to, confine, the, radio, source, it, may, also, be, that, the, larger, amounts, of, cold, gas, in, spiral, galaxies, in, some, way, disrupts, or, stifles, a, forming, jet, to, date, there, is, no, compelling, single, explanation, for, the, observations, the, different, types, of, radio, loud, active, galaxies, are, linked, by, unified, models, the, key, observation, that, led, to, the, adoption, of, unified, models, for, powerful, radio, galaxies, and, radio, loud, quasars, was, that, all, quasars, appear, to, be, beamed, towards, us, showing, superluminal, motion, in, the, cores, and, bright, jets, on, the, side, of, the, source, nearest, to, us, the, laing, garrington, effect, if, this, is, the, case, there, must, be, a, population, of, objects, not, beamed, towards, us, and, since, we, know, the, lobes, are, not, affected, by, beaming, they, would, appear, as, radio, galaxies, provided, that, the, quasar, nucleus, is, obscured, when, the, source, is, seen, side, on, it, is, now, accepted, that, at, least, some, powerful, radio, galaxies, have, hidden, quasars, though, it, is, not, clear, whether, all, such, radio, galaxies, would, be, quasars, if, viewed, from, the, right, angle, in, a, similar, way, low, power, radio, galaxies, are, a, plausible, parent, population, for, bl, lac, objects, radio, galaxies, and, radio, loud, quasars, have, been, widely, used, particularly, in, the, 80s, and, 90s, to, find, distant, galaxies, by, selecting, based, on, radio, spectrum, and, then, observing, the, host, galaxy, it, was, possible, to, find, objects, at, high, redshift, at, modest, cost, in, telescope, time, the, problem, with, this, method, is, that, hosts, of, active, galaxies, may, not, be, typical, of, galaxies, at, their, redshift, similarly, radio, galaxies, have, in, the, past, been, used, to, find, distant, x, ray, emitting, clusters, but, unbiased, selection, methods, are, now, preferred, the, most, distant, radio, galaxy, currently, known, is, tgss, j1530, 1049, at, a, redshift, of, 5, 72, some, work, has, been, done, attempting, to, use, radio, galaxies, as, standard, rulers, to, determine, cosmological, parameters, this, method, is, fraught, with, difficulty, because, a, radio, galaxy, s, size, depends, on, both, its, age, and, its, environment, when, a, model, of, the, radio, source, is, used, though, methods, based, on, radio, galaxies, can, give, good, agreement, with, other, cosmological, observations, whether, or, not, a, radio, source, is, expanding, supersonically, it, must, do, work, against, the, external, medium, in, expanding, and, so, it, puts, energy, into, heating, and, lifting, the, external, plasma, the, minimum, energy, stored, in, the, lobes, of, a, powerful, radio, source, might, be, 10, 53, j, the, lower, limit, on, the, work, done, on, the, external, medium, by, such, a, source, is, several, times, this, a, good, deal, of, the, current, interest, in, radio, sources, focuses, on, the, effect, they, must, have, at, the, centres, of, clusters, at, the, present, day, equally, interesting, is, their, likely, effect, on, structure, formation, over, cosmological, time, it, is, thought, that, they, may, provide, a, feedback, mechanism, to, slow, the, formation, of, the, most, massive, objects, widely, used, terminology, is, awkward, now, that, it, is, generally, accepted, that, quasars, and, radio, galaxies, are, the, same, objects, see, above, the, acronym, dragn, for, double, radiosource, associated, with, galactic, nucleus, was, coined, by, patrick, leahy, in, 1993, and, is, in, use, extragalactic, radio, source, is, common, but, can, lead, to, confusion, since, many, other, extragalactic, objects, are, detected, in, radio, surveys, notably, starburst, galaxies, radio, loud, active, galaxy, is, unambiguous, and, so, is, often, used, in, this, article
