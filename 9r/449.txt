ice, is, water, that, is, frozen, into, a, solid, state, typically, forming, at, or, below, temperatures, of, 0, c, 32, f, or, 273, 15, k, it, occurs, naturally, on, earth, on, other, planets, in, oort, cloud, objects, and, as, interstellar, ice, as, a, naturally, occurring, crystalline, inorganic, solid, with, an, ordered, structure, ice, is, considered, to, be, a, mineral, depending, on, the, presence, of, impurities, such, as, particles, of, soil, or, bubbles, of, air, it, can, appear, transparent, or, a, more, or, less, opaque, bluish, white, color, virtually, all, of, the, ice, on, earth, is, of, a, hexagonal, crystalline, structure, denoted, as, ice, i, h, spoken, as, ice, one, h, depending, on, temperature, and, pressure, at, least, nineteen, phases, packing, geometries, can, exist, the, most, common, phase, transition, to, ice, i, h, occurs, when, liquid, water, is, cooled, below, 0, c, 273, 15, k, 32, f, at, standard, atmospheric, pressure, when, water, is, cooled, rapidly, quenching, up, to, three, types, of, amorphous, ice, can, form, interstellar, ice, is, overwhelmingly, low, density, amorphous, ice, lda, which, likely, makes, lda, ice, the, most, abundant, type, in, the, universe, when, cooled, slowly, correlated, proton, tunneling, occurs, below, 253, 15, c, 20, k, 423, 67, f, giving, rise, to, macroscopic, quantum, phenomena, ice, is, abundant, on, the, earth, s, surface, particularly, in, the, polar, regions, and, above, the, snow, line, where, it, can, aggregate, from, snow, to, form, glaciers, and, ice, sheets, as, snowflakes, and, hail, ice, is, a, common, form, of, precipitation, and, it, may, also, be, deposited, directly, by, water, vapor, as, frost, the, transition, from, ice, to, water, is, melting, and, from, ice, directly, to, water, vapor, is, sublimation, these, processes, plays, a, key, role, in, earth, s, water, cycle, and, climate, in, the, recent, decades, ice, volume, on, earth, has, been, decreasing, due, to, climate, change, the, largest, declines, have, occurred, in, the, arctic, and, in, the, mountains, located, outside, of, the, polar, regions, the, loss, of, grounded, ice, as, opposed, to, floating, sea, ice, is, the, primary, contributor, to, sea, level, rise, humans, have, been, using, ice, for, various, purposes, for, thousands, of, years, some, historic, structures, designed, to, hold, ice, to, provide, cooling, are, over, 2, 000, years, old, before, the, invention, of, refrigeration, technology, the, only, way, to, safely, store, food, without, modifying, it, through, preservatives, was, to, use, ice, sufficiently, solid, surface, ice, makes, waterways, accessible, to, land, transport, during, winter, and, dedicated, ice, roads, may, be, maintained, ice, also, plays, a, major, role, in, winter, sports, ice, possesses, a, regular, crystalline, structure, based, on, the, molecule, of, water, which, consists, of, a, single, oxygen, atom, covalently, bonded, to, two, hydrogen, atoms, or, h, o, h, however, many, of, the, physical, properties, of, water, and, ice, are, controlled, by, the, formation, of, hydrogen, bonds, between, adjacent, oxygen, and, hydrogen, atoms, while, it, is, a, weak, bond, it, is, nonetheless, critical, in, controlling, the, structure, of, both, water, and, ice, an, unusual, property, of, water, is, that, its, solid, form, ice, frozen, at, atmospheric, pressure, is, approximately, 8, 3, less, dense, than, its, liquid, form, this, is, equivalent, to, a, volumetric, expansion, of, 9, the, density, of, ice, is, 0, 9167, 0, 9168, g, cm, 3, at, 0, c, and, standard, atmospheric, pressure, 101, 325, pa, whereas, water, has, a, density, of, 0, 9998, 0, 999863, g, cm, 3, at, the, same, temperature, and, pressure, liquid, water, is, densest, essentially, 1, 00, g, cm, 3, at, 4, c, and, begins, to, lose, its, density, as, the, water, molecules, begin, to, form, the, hexagonal, crystals, of, ice, as, the, freezing, point, is, reached, this, is, due, to, hydrogen, bonding, dominating, the, intermolecular, forces, which, results, in, a, packing, of, molecules, less, compact, in, the, solid, the, density, of, ice, increases, slightly, with, decreasing, temperature, and, has, a, value, of, 0, 9340, g, cm, 3, at, 180, c, 93, k, when, water, freezes, it, increases, in, volume, about, 9, for, fresh, water, the, effect, of, expansion, during, freezing, can, be, dramatic, and, ice, expansion, is, a, basic, cause, of, freeze, thaw, weathering, of, rock, in, nature, and, damage, to, building, foundations, and, roadways, from, frost, heaving, it, is, also, a, common, cause, of, the, flooding, of, houses, when, water, pipes, burst, due, to, the, pressure, of, expanding, water, when, it, freezes, because, ice, is, less, dense, than, liquid, water, it, floats, and, this, prevents, bottom, up, freezing, of, the, bodies, of, water, instead, a, sheltered, environment, for, animal, and, plant, life, is, formed, beneath, the, floating, ice, which, protects, the, underside, from, short, term, weather, extremes, such, as, wind, chill, sufficiently, thin, floating, ice, allows, light, to, pass, through, supporting, the, photosynthesis, of, bacterial, and, algal, colonies, when, sea, water, freezes, the, ice, is, riddled, with, brine, filled, channels, which, sustain, sympagic, organisms, such, as, bacteria, algae, copepods, and, annelids, in, turn, they, provide, food, for, animals, such, as, krill, and, specialized, fish, like, the, bald, notothen, fed, upon, in, turn, by, larger, animals, such, as, emperor, penguins, and, minke, whales, when, ice, melts, it, absorbs, as, much, energy, as, it, would, take, to, heat, an, equivalent, mass, of, water, by, 80, c, 176, f, during, the, melting, process, the, temperature, remains, constant, at, 0, c, 32, f, while, melting, any, energy, added, breaks, the, hydrogen, bonds, between, ice, water, molecules, energy, becomes, available, to, increase, the, thermal, energy, temperature, only, after, enough, hydrogen, bonds, are, broken, that, the, ice, can, be, considered, liquid, water, the, amount, of, energy, consumed, in, breaking, hydrogen, bonds, in, the, transition, from, ice, to, water, is, known, as, the, heat, of, fusion, as, with, water, ice, absorbs, light, at, the, red, end, of, the, spectrum, preferentially, as, the, result, of, an, overtone, of, an, oxygen, hydrogen, o, h, bond, stretch, compared, with, water, this, absorption, is, shifted, toward, slightly, lower, energies, thus, ice, appears, blue, with, a, slightly, greener, tint, than, liquid, water, since, absorption, is, cumulative, the, color, effect, intensifies, with, increasing, thickness, or, if, internal, reflections, cause, the, light, to, take, a, longer, path, through, the, ice, other, colors, can, appear, in, the, presence, of, light, absorbing, impurities, where, the, impurity, is, dictating, the, color, rather, than, the, ice, itself, for, instance, icebergs, containing, impurities, e, g, sediments, algae, air, bubbles, can, appear, brown, grey, or, green, because, ice, in, natural, environments, is, usually, close, to, its, melting, temperature, its, hardness, shows, pronounced, temperature, variations, at, its, melting, point, ice, has, a, mohs, hardness, of, 2, or, less, but, the, hardness, increases, to, about, 4, at, a, temperature, of, 44, c, 47, f, and, to, 6, at, a, temperature, of, 78, 5, c, 109, 3, f, the, vaporization, point, of, solid, carbon, dioxide, dry, ice, most, liquids, under, increased, pressure, freeze, at, higher, temperatures, because, the, pressure, helps, to, hold, the, molecules, together, however, the, strong, hydrogen, bonds, in, water, make, it, different, for, some, pressures, higher, than, 1, atm, 0, 10, mpa, water, freezes, at, a, temperature, below, 0, c, 32, f, ice, water, and, water, vapour, can, coexist, at, the, triple, point, which, is, exactly, 273, 16, k, 0, 01, c, at, a, pressure, of, 611, 657, pa, the, kelvin, was, defined, as, 1, 273, 16, of, the, difference, between, this, triple, point, and, absolute, zero, though, this, definition, changed, in, may, 2019, unlike, most, other, solids, ice, is, difficult, to, superheat, in, an, experiment, ice, at, 3, c, was, superheated, to, about, 17, c, for, about, 250, picoseconds, subjected, to, higher, pressures, and, varying, temperatures, ice, can, form, in, nineteen, separate, known, crystalline, phases, at, various, densities, along, with, hypothetical, proposed, phases, of, ice, that, have, not, been, observed, with, care, at, least, fifteen, of, these, phases, one, of, the, known, exceptions, being, ice, x, can, be, recovered, at, ambient, pressure, and, low, temperature, in, metastable, form, the, types, are, differentiated, by, their, crystalline, structure, proton, ordering, and, density, there, are, also, two, metastable, phases, of, ice, under, pressure, both, fully, hydrogen, disordered, these, are, ice, iv, and, ice, xii, ice, xii, was, discovered, in, 1996, in, 2006, ice, xiii, and, ice, xiv, were, discovered, ices, xi, xiii, and, xiv, are, hydrogen, ordered, forms, of, ices, i, h, v, and, xii, respectively, in, 2009, ice, xv, was, found, at, extremely, high, pressures, and, 143, c, at, even, higher, pressures, ice, is, predicted, to, become, a, metal, this, has, been, variously, estimated, to, occur, at, 1, 55, tpa, or, 5, 62, tpa, as, well, as, crystalline, forms, solid, water, can, exist, in, amorphous, states, as, amorphous, solid, water, asw, of, varying, densities, in, outer, space, hexagonal, crystalline, ice, is, present, in, the, ice, volcanoes, but, is, extremely, rare, otherwise, even, icy, moons, like, ganymede, are, expected, to, mainly, consist, of, other, crystalline, forms, of, ice, water, in, the, interstellar, medium, is, dominated, by, amorphous, ice, making, it, likely, the, most, common, form, of, water, in, the, universe, low, density, asw, lda, also, known, as, hyperquenched, glassy, water, may, be, responsible, for, noctilucent, clouds, on, earth, and, is, usually, formed, by, deposition, of, water, vapor, in, cold, or, vacuum, conditions, high, density, asw, hda, is, formed, by, compression, of, ordinary, ice, i, h, or, lda, at, gpa, pressures, very, high, density, asw, vhda, is, hda, slightly, warmed, to, 160, k, under, 1, 2, gpa, pressures, ice, from, a, theorized, superionic, water, may, possess, two, crystalline, structures, at, pressures, in, excess, of, 500, 000, bars, 7, 300, 000, psi, such, superionic, ice, would, take, on, a, body, centered, cubic, structure, however, at, pressures, in, excess, of, 1, 000, 000, bars, 15, 000, 000, psi, the, structure, may, shift, to, a, more, stable, face, centered, cubic, lattice, it, is, speculated, that, superionic, ice, could, compose, the, interior, of, ice, giants, such, as, uranus, and, neptune, ice, is, slippery, because, it, has, a, low, coefficient, of, friction, this, subject, was, first, scientifically, investigated, in, the, 19th, century, the, preferred, explanation, at, the, time, was, pressure, melting, i, e, the, blade, of, an, ice, skate, upon, exerting, pressure, on, the, ice, would, melt, a, thin, layer, providing, sufficient, lubrication, for, the, blade, to, glide, across, the, ice, yet, 1939, research, by, frank, p, bowden, and, t, p, hughes, found, that, skaters, would, experience, a, lot, more, friction, than, they, actually, do, if, it, were, the, only, explanation, further, the, optimum, temperature, for, figure, skating, is, 5, 5, c, 22, f, 268, k, and, 9, c, 16, f, 264, k, for, hockey, yet, according, to, pressure, melting, theory, skating, below, 4, c, 25, f, 269, k, would, be, outright, impossible, instead, bowden, and, hughes, argued, that, heating, and, melting, of, the, ice, layer, is, caused, by, friction, however, this, theory, does, not, sufficiently, explain, why, ice, is, slippery, when, standing, still, even, at, below, zero, temperatures, subsequent, research, suggested, that, ice, molecules, at, the, interface, cannot, properly, bond, with, the, molecules, of, the, mass, of, ice, beneath, and, thus, are, free, to, move, like, molecules, of, liquid, water, these, molecules, remain, in, a, semi, liquid, state, providing, lubrication, regardless, of, pressure, against, the, ice, exerted, by, any, object, however, the, significance, of, this, hypothesis, is, disputed, by, experiments, showing, a, high, coefficient, of, friction, for, ice, using, atomic, force, microscopy, thus, the, mechanism, controlling, the, frictional, properties, of, ice, is, still, an, active, area, of, scientific, study, a, comprehensive, theory, of, ice, friction, must, take, into, account, all, of, the, aforementioned, mechanisms, to, estimate, friction, coefficient, of, ice, against, various, materials, as, a, function, of, temperature, and, sliding, speed, 2014, research, suggests, that, frictional, heating, is, the, most, important, process, under, most, typical, conditions, the, term, that, collectively, describes, all, of, the, parts, of, the, earth, s, surface, where, water, is, in, frozen, form, is, the, cryosphere, ice, is, an, important, component, of, the, global, climate, particularly, in, regard, to, the, water, cycle, glaciers, and, snowpacks, are, an, important, storage, mechanism, for, fresh, water, over, time, they, may, sublimate, or, melt, snowmelt, is, an, important, source, of, seasonal, fresh, water, the, world, meteorological, organization, defines, several, kinds, of, ice, depending, on, origin, size, shape, influence, and, so, on, clathrate, hydrates, are, forms, of, ice, that, contain, gas, molecules, trapped, within, its, crystal, lattice, ice, that, is, found, at, sea, may, be, in, the, form, of, drift, ice, floating, in, the, water, fast, ice, fixed, to, a, shoreline, or, anchor, ice, if, attached, to, the, seafloor, ice, which, calves, breaks, off, from, an, ice, shelf, or, a, coastal, glacier, may, become, an, iceberg, the, aftermath, of, calving, events, produces, a, loose, mixture, of, snow, and, ice, known, as, ice, m, lange, sea, ice, forms, in, several, stages, at, first, small, millimeter, scale, crystals, accumulate, on, the, water, surface, in, what, is, known, as, frazil, ice, as, they, become, somewhat, larger, and, more, consistent, in, shape, and, cover, the, water, surface, begins, to, look, oily, from, above, so, this, stage, is, called, grease, ice, then, ice, continues, to, clump, together, and, solidify, into, flat, cohesive, pieces, known, as, ice, floes, ice, floes, are, the, basic, building, blocks, of, sea, ice, cover, and, their, horizontal, size, defined, as, half, of, their, diameter, varies, dramatically, with, the, smallest, measured, in, centimeters, and, the, largest, in, hundreds, of, kilometers, an, area, which, is, over, 70, ice, on, its, surface, is, said, to, be, covered, by, pack, ice, fully, formed, sea, ice, can, be, forced, together, by, currents, and, winds, to, form, pressure, ridges, up, to, 12, metres, 39, ft, tall, on, the, other, hand, active, wave, activity, can, reduce, sea, ice, to, small, regularly, shaped, pieces, known, as, pancake, ice, sometimes, wind, and, wave, activity, polishes, sea, ice, to, perfectly, spherical, pieces, known, as, ice, eggs, the, largest, ice, formations, on, earth, are, the, two, ice, sheets, which, almost, completely, cover, the, world, s, largest, island, greenland, and, the, continent, of, antarctica, these, ice, sheets, have, an, average, thickness, of, over, 1, km, 0, 6, mi, and, have, existed, for, millions, of, years, other, major, ice, formations, on, land, include, ice, caps, ice, fields, ice, streams, and, glaciers, in, particular, the, hindu, kush, region, is, known, as, the, earth, s, third, pole, due, to, the, large, number, of, glaciers, it, contains, they, cover, an, area, of, around, 80, 000, km, 2, 31, 000, sq, mi, and, have, a, combined, volume, of, between, 3, 000, 4, 700, km, 3, these, glaciers, are, nicknamed, asian, water, towers, because, their, meltwater, run, off, feeds, into, rivers, which, provide, water, for, an, estimated, two, billion, people, permafrost, refers, to, soil, or, underwater, sediment, which, continuously, remains, below, 0, c, 32, f, for, two, years, or, more, the, ice, within, permafrost, is, divided, into, four, categories, pore, ice, vein, ice, also, known, as, ice, wedges, buried, surface, ice, and, intrasedimental, ice, from, the, freezing, of, underground, waters, one, example, of, ice, formation, in, permafrost, areas, is, aufeis, layered, ice, that, forms, in, arctic, and, subarctic, stream, valleys, ice, frozen, in, the, stream, bed, blocks, normal, groundwater, discharge, and, causes, the, local, water, table, to, rise, resulting, in, water, discharge, on, top, of, the, frozen, layer, this, water, then, freezes, causing, the, water, table, to, rise, further, and, repeat, the, cycle, the, result, is, a, stratified, ice, deposit, often, several, meters, thick, snow, line, and, snow, fields, are, two, related, concepts, in, that, snow, fields, accumulate, on, top, of, and, ablate, away, to, the, equilibrium, point, the, snow, line, in, an, ice, deposit, ice, which, forms, on, moving, water, tends, to, be, less, uniform, and, stable, than, ice, which, forms, on, calm, water, ice, jams, sometimes, called, ice, dams, when, broken, chunks, of, ice, pile, up, are, the, greatest, ice, hazard, on, rivers, ice, jams, can, cause, flooding, damage, structures, in, or, near, the, river, and, damage, vessels, on, the, river, ice, jams, can, cause, some, hydropower, industrial, facilities, to, completely, shut, down, an, ice, dam, is, a, blockage, from, the, movement, of, a, glacier, which, may, produce, a, proglacial, lake, heavy, ice, flows, in, rivers, can, also, damage, vessels, and, require, the, use, of, an, icebreaker, vessel, to, keep, navigation, possible, ice, discs, are, circular, formations, of, ice, floating, on, river, water, they, form, within, eddy, currents, and, their, position, results, in, asymmetric, melting, which, makes, them, continuously, rotate, at, a, low, speed, ice, forms, on, calm, water, from, the, shores, a, thin, layer, spreading, across, the, surface, and, then, downward, ice, on, lakes, is, generally, four, types, primary, secondary, superimposed, and, agglomerate, primary, ice, forms, first, secondary, ice, forms, below, the, primary, ice, in, a, direction, parallel, to, the, direction, of, the, heat, flow, superimposed, ice, forms, on, top, of, the, ice, surface, from, rain, or, water, which, seeps, up, through, cracks, in, the, ice, which, often, settles, when, loaded, with, snow, an, ice, shove, occurs, when, ice, movement, caused, by, ice, expansion, and, or, wind, action, occurs, to, the, extent, that, ice, pushes, onto, the, shores, of, lakes, often, displacing, sediment, that, makes, up, the, shoreline, shelf, ice, is, formed, when, floating, pieces, of, ice, are, driven, by, the, wind, piling, up, on, the, windward, shore, this, kind, of, ice, may, contain, large, air, pockets, under, a, thin, surface, layer, which, makes, it, particularly, hazardous, to, walk, across, it, another, dangerous, form, of, rotten, ice, to, traverse, on, foot, is, candle, ice, which, develops, in, columns, perpendicular, to, the, surface, of, a, lake, because, it, lacks, a, firm, horizontal, structure, a, person, who, has, fallen, through, has, nothing, to, hold, onto, to, pull, themselves, out, snow, crystals, form, when, tiny, supercooled, cloud, droplets, about, 10, m, in, diameter, freeze, these, droplets, are, able, to, remain, liquid, at, temperatures, lower, than, 18, c, 255, k, 0, f, because, to, freeze, a, few, molecules, in, the, droplet, need, to, get, together, by, chance, to, form, an, arrangement, similar, to, that, in, an, ice, lattice, then, the, droplet, freezes, around, this, nucleus, experiments, show, that, this, homogeneous, nucleation, of, cloud, droplets, only, occurs, at, temperatures, lower, than, 35, c, 238, k, 31, f, in, warmer, clouds, an, aerosol, particle, or, ice, nucleus, must, be, present, in, or, in, contact, with, the, droplet, to, act, as, a, nucleus, our, understanding, of, what, particles, make, efficient, ice, nuclei, is, poor, what, we, do, know, is, they, are, very, rare, compared, to, that, cloud, condensation, nuclei, on, which, liquid, droplets, form, clays, desert, dust, and, biological, particles, may, be, effective, although, to, what, extent, is, unclear, artificial, nuclei, are, used, in, cloud, seeding, the, droplet, then, grows, by, condensation, of, water, vapor, onto, the, ice, surfaces, ice, storm, is, a, type, of, winter, storm, characterized, by, freezing, rain, which, produces, a, glaze, of, ice, on, surfaces, including, roads, and, power, lines, in, the, united, states, a, quarter, of, winter, weather, events, produce, glaze, ice, and, utilities, need, to, be, prepared, to, minimize, damages, hail, forms, in, storm, clouds, when, supercooled, water, droplets, freeze, on, contact, with, condensation, nuclei, such, as, dust, or, dirt, the, storm, s, updraft, blows, the, hailstones, to, the, upper, part, of, the, cloud, the, updraft, dissipates, and, the, hailstones, fall, down, back, into, the, updraft, and, are, lifted, up, again, hail, has, a, diameter, of, 5, millimetres, 0, 20, in, or, more, within, metar, code, gr, is, used, to, indicate, larger, hail, of, a, diameter, of, at, least, 6, 4, millimetres, 0, 25, in, and, gs, for, smaller, stones, of, 19, millimetres, 0, 75, in, 25, millimetres, 1, 0, in, and, 44, millimetres, 1, 75, in, are, the, most, frequently, reported, hail, sizes, in, north, america, hailstones, can, grow, to, 15, centimetres, 6, in, and, weigh, more, than, 0, 5, kilograms, 1, 1, lb, in, large, hailstones, latent, heat, released, by, further, freezing, may, melt, the, outer, shell, of, the, hailstone, the, hailstone, then, may, undergo, wet, growth, where, the, liquid, outer, shell, collects, other, smaller, hailstones, the, hailstone, gains, an, ice, layer, and, grows, increasingly, larger, with, each, ascent, once, a, hailstone, becomes, too, heavy, to, be, supported, by, the, storm, s, updraft, it, falls, from, the, cloud, hail, forms, in, strong, thunderstorm, clouds, particularly, those, with, intense, updrafts, high, liquid, water, content, great, vertical, extent, large, water, droplets, and, where, a, good, portion, of, the, cloud, layer, is, below, freezing, 0, c, 32, f, hail, producing, clouds, are, often, identifiable, by, their, green, coloration, the, growth, rate, is, maximized, at, about, 13, c, 9, f, and, becomes, vanishingly, small, much, below, 30, c, 22, f, as, supercooled, water, droplets, become, rare, for, this, reason, hail, is, most, common, within, continental, interiors, of, the, mid, latitudes, as, hail, formation, is, considerably, more, likely, when, the, freezing, level, is, below, the, altitude, of, 11, 000, feet, 3, 400, m, entrainment, of, dry, air, into, strong, thunderstorms, over, continents, can, increase, the, frequency, of, hail, by, promoting, evaporative, cooling, which, lowers, the, freezing, level, of, thunderstorm, clouds, giving, hail, a, larger, volume, to, grow, in, accordingly, hail, is, actually, less, common, in, the, tropics, despite, a, much, higher, frequency, of, thunderstorms, than, in, the, mid, latitudes, because, the, atmosphere, over, the, tropics, tends, to, be, warmer, over, a, much, greater, depth, hail, in, the, tropics, occurs, mainly, at, higher, elevations, ice, pellets, metar, code, pl, are, a, form, of, precipitation, consisting, of, small, translucent, balls, of, ice, which, are, usually, smaller, than, hailstones, this, form, of, precipitation, is, also, referred, to, as, sleet, by, the, united, states, national, weather, service, in, british, english, sleet, refers, to, a, mixture, of, rain, and, snow, ice, pellets, typically, form, alongside, freezing, rain, when, a, wet, warm, front, ends, up, between, colder, and, drier, atmospheric, layers, there, raindrops, would, both, freeze, and, shrink, in, size, due, to, evaporative, cooling, so, called, snow, pellets, or, graupel, form, when, multiple, water, droplets, freeze, onto, snowflakes, until, a, soft, ball, like, shape, is, formed, so, called, diamond, dust, metar, code, ic, also, known, as, ice, needles, or, ice, crystals, forms, at, temperatures, approaching, 40, c, 40, f, due, to, air, with, slightly, higher, moisture, from, aloft, mixing, with, colder, surface, based, air, as, water, drips, and, re, freezes, it, can, form, hanging, icicles, or, stalagmite, like, structures, on, the, ground, on, sloped, roofs, buildup, of, ice, can, produce, an, ice, dam, which, stops, melt, water, from, draining, properly, and, potentially, leads, to, damaging, leaks, more, generally, water, vapor, depositing, onto, surfaces, due, to, high, relative, humidity, and, then, freezing, results, in, various, forms, of, atmospheric, icing, or, frost, inside, buildings, this, can, be, seen, as, ice, on, the, surface, of, un, insulated, windows, hoar, frost, is, common, in, the, environment, particularly, in, the, low, lying, areas, such, as, valleys, in, antarctica, the, temperatures, can, be, so, low, that, electrostatic, attraction, is, increased, to, the, point, hoarfrost, on, snow, sticks, together, when, blown, by, wind, into, tumbleweed, like, balls, known, as, yukimarimo, sometimes, drops, of, water, crystallize, on, cold, objects, as, rime, instead, of, glaze, soft, rime, has, a, density, between, a, quarter, and, two, thirds, that, of, pure, ice, due, to, a, high, proportion, of, trapped, air, which, also, makes, soft, rime, appear, white, hard, rime, is, denser, more, transparent, and, more, likely, to, appear, on, ships, and, aircraft, cold, wind, specifically, causes, what, is, known, as, advection, frost, when, it, collides, with, objects, when, it, occurs, on, plants, it, often, causes, damage, to, them, various, methods, exist, to, protect, agricultural, crops, from, frost, from, simply, covering, them, to, using, wind, machines, in, recent, decades, irrigation, sprinklers, have, been, calibrated, to, spray, just, enough, water, to, preemptively, create, a, layer, of, ice, that, would, form, slowly, and, so, avoid, a, sudden, temperature, shock, to, the, plant, and, not, be, so, thick, as, to, cause, damage, with, its, weight, ablation, of, ice, refers, to, both, its, melting, and, its, dissolution, the, melting, of, ice, entails, the, breaking, of, hydrogen, bonds, between, the, water, molecules, the, ordering, of, the, molecules, in, the, solid, breaks, down, to, a, less, ordered, state, and, the, solid, melts, to, become, a, liquid, this, is, achieved, by, increasing, the, internal, energy, of, the, ice, beyond, the, melting, point, when, ice, melts, it, absorbs, as, much, energy, as, would, be, required, to, heat, an, equivalent, amount, of, water, by, 80, c, while, melting, the, temperature, of, the, ice, surface, remains, constant, at, 0, c, the, rate, of, the, melting, process, depends, on, the, efficiency, of, the, energy, exchange, process, an, ice, surface, in, fresh, water, melts, solely, by, free, convection, with, a, rate, that, depends, linearly, on, the, water, temperature, t, when, t, is, less, than, 3, 98, c, and, superlinearly, when, t, is, equal, to, or, greater, than, 3, 98, c, with, the, rate, being, proportional, to, t, 3, 98, c, with, 5, 3, for, t, much, greater, than, 8, c, and, 4, 3, for, in, between, temperatures, t, in, salty, ambient, conditions, dissolution, rather, than, melting, often, causes, the, ablation, of, ice, for, example, the, temperature, of, the, arctic, ocean, is, generally, below, the, melting, point, of, ablating, sea, ice, the, phase, transition, from, solid, to, liquid, is, achieved, by, mixing, salt, and, water, molecules, similar, to, the, dissolution, of, sugar, in, water, even, though, the, water, temperature, is, far, below, the, melting, point, of, the, sugar, however, the, dissolution, rate, is, limited, by, salt, concentration, and, is, therefore, slower, than, melting, ice, has, long, been, valued, as, a, means, of, cooling, in, 400, bc, iran, persian, engineers, had, already, developed, techniques, for, ice, storage, in, the, desert, through, the, summer, months, during, the, winter, ice, was, transported, from, harvesting, pools, and, nearby, mountains, in, large, quantities, to, be, stored, in, specially, designed, naturally, cooled, refrigerators, called, yakhchal, meaning, ice, storage, yakhchals, were, large, underground, spaces, up, to, 5000, m, 3, that, had, thick, walls, at, least, two, meters, at, the, base, made, of, a, specific, type, of, mortar, called, sarooj, made, from, sand, clay, egg, whites, lime, goat, hair, and, ash, the, mortar, was, resistant, to, heat, transfer, helping, to, keep, the, ice, cool, enough, not, to, melt, it, was, also, impenetrable, by, water, yakhchals, often, included, a, qanat, and, a, system, of, windcatchers, that, could, lower, internal, temperatures, to, frigid, levels, even, during, the, heat, of, the, summer, one, use, for, the, ice, was, to, create, chilled, treats, for, royalty, there, were, thriving, industries, in, 16th, 17th, century, england, whereby, low, lying, areas, along, the, thames, estuary, were, flooded, during, the, winter, and, ice, harvested, in, carts, and, stored, inter, seasonally, in, insulated, wooden, houses, as, a, provision, to, an, icehouse, often, located, in, large, country, houses, and, widely, used, to, keep, fish, fresh, when, caught, in, distant, waters, this, was, allegedly, copied, by, an, englishman, who, had, seen, the, same, activity, in, china, ice, was, imported, into, england, from, norway, on, a, considerable, scale, as, early, as, 1823, in, the, united, states, the, first, cargo, of, ice, was, sent, from, new, york, city, to, charleston, south, carolina, in, 1799, and, by, the, first, half, of, the, 19th, century, ice, harvesting, had, become, a, big, business, frederic, tudor, who, became, known, as, the, ice, king, worked, on, developing, better, insulation, products, for, long, distance, shipments, of, ice, especially, to, the, tropics, this, became, known, as, the, ice, trade, between, 1812, and, 1822, under, lloyd, hesketh, bamford, hesketh, s, instruction, gwrych, castle, was, built, with, 18, large, towers, one, of, those, towers, is, called, the, ice, tower, its, sole, purpose, was, to, store, ice, trieste, sent, ice, to, egypt, corfu, and, zante, switzerland, to, france, and, germany, sometimes, was, supplied, from, bavarian, lakes, from, 1930s, and, up, until, 1994, the, hungarian, parliament, building, used, ice, harvested, in, the, winter, from, lake, balaton, for, air, conditioning, ice, houses, were, used, to, store, ice, formed, in, the, winter, to, make, ice, available, all, year, long, and, an, early, type, of, refrigerator, known, as, an, icebox, was, cooled, using, a, block, of, ice, placed, inside, it, many, cities, had, a, regular, ice, delivery, service, during, the, summer, the, advent, of, artificial, refrigeration, technology, made, the, delivery, of, ice, obsolete, ice, is, still, harvested, for, ice, and, snow, sculpture, events, for, example, a, swing, saw, is, used, to, get, ice, for, the, harbin, international, ice, and, snow, sculpture, festival, each, year, from, the, frozen, surface, of, the, songhua, river, the, earliest, known, written, process, to, artificially, make, ice, is, by, the, 13th, century, writings, of, arab, historian, ibn, abu, usaybia, in, his, book, kitab, uyun, al, anba, fi, tabaqat, al, atibba, concerning, medicine, in, which, ibn, abu, usaybia, attributes, the, process, to, an, even, older, author, ibn, bakhtawayhi, of, whom, nothing, is, known, ice, is, now, produced, on, an, industrial, scale, for, uses, including, food, storage, and, processing, chemical, manufacturing, concrete, mixing, and, curing, and, consumer, or, packaged, ice, most, commercial, icemakers, produce, three, basic, types, of, fragmentary, ice, flake, tubular, and, plate, using, a, variety, of, techniques, large, batch, ice, makers, can, produce, up, to, 75, tons, of, ice, per, day, in, 2002, there, were, 426, commercial, ice, making, companies, in, the, united, states, with, a, combined, value, of, shipments, of, 595, 487, 000, home, refrigerators, can, also, make, ice, with, a, built, in, icemaker, which, will, typically, make, ice, cubes, or, crushed, ice, the, first, such, device, was, presented, in, 1965, by, frigidaire, ice, forming, on, roads, is, a, common, winter, hazard, and, black, ice, particularly, dangerous, because, it, is, very, difficult, to, see, it, is, both, very, transparent, and, often, forms, specifically, in, shaded, and, therefore, cooler, and, darker, areas, i, e, beneath, overpasses, whenever, there, is, freezing, rain, or, snow, which, occurs, at, a, temperature, near, the, melting, point, it, is, common, for, ice, to, build, up, on, the, windows, of, vehicles, often, snow, melts, re, freezes, and, forms, a, fragmented, layer, of, ice, which, effectively, glues, snow, to, the, window, in, this, case, the, frozen, mass, is, commonly, removed, with, ice, scrapers, a, thin, layer, of, ice, crystals, can, also, form, on, the, inside, surface, of, car, windows, during, sufficiently, cold, weather, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, some, vehicles, such, as, ford, thunderbird, could, be, upgraded, with, heated, windshields, as, the, result, this, technology, fell, out, of, style, as, it, was, too, expensive, and, prone, to, damage, but, rear, window, defrosters, are, cheaper, to, maintain, and, so, are, more, widespread, in, sufficiently, cold, places, the, layers, of, ice, on, water, surfaces, can, get, thick, enough, for, ice, roads, to, be, built, some, regulations, specify, that, the, minimum, safe, thickness, is, 4, in, 10, cm, for, a, person, 7, in, 18, cm, for, a, snowmobile, and, 15, in, 38, cm, for, an, automobile, lighter, than, 5, tonnes, for, trucks, effective, thickness, varies, with, load, i, e, a, vehicle, with, 9, ton, total, weight, requires, a, thickness, of, 20, in, 51, cm, notably, the, speed, limit, for, a, vehicle, moving, at, a, road, which, meets, its, minimum, safe, thickness, is, 25, km, h, 15, mph, going, up, to, 35, km, h, 25, mph, if, the, road, s, thickness, is, 2, or, more, times, larger, than, the, minimum, safe, value, there, is, a, known, instance, where, a, railroad, has, been, built, on, ice, the, most, famous, ice, road, had, been, the, road, of, life, across, lake, ladoga, it, operated, in, the, winters, of, 1941, 1942, and, 1942, 1943, when, it, was, the, only, land, route, available, to, the, soviet, union, to, relieve, the, siege, of, leningrad, by, the, german, army, group, north, 76, 80, the, trucks, moved, hundreds, of, thousands, tonnes, of, supplies, into, the, city, and, hundreds, of, thousands, of, civilians, were, evacuated, it, is, now, a, world, heritage, site, for, ships, ice, presents, two, distinct, hazards, firstly, spray, and, freezing, rain, can, produce, an, ice, build, up, on, the, superstructure, of, a, vessel, sufficient, to, make, it, unstable, potentially, to, the, point, of, capsizing, earlier, crewmembers, were, regularly, forced, to, manually, hack, off, ice, build, up, after, 1980s, spraying, de, icing, chemicals, or, melting, the, ice, through, hot, water, steam, hoses, became, more, common, secondly, icebergs, large, masses, of, ice, floating, in, water, typically, created, when, glaciers, reach, the, sea, can, be, dangerous, if, struck, by, a, ship, when, underway, icebergs, have, been, responsible, for, the, sinking, of, many, ships, the, most, famous, being, the, titanic, for, harbors, near, the, poles, being, ice, free, ideally, all, year, long, is, an, important, advantage, examples, are, murmansk, russia, petsamo, russia, formerly, finland, and, vard, norway, harbors, which, are, not, ice, free, are, opened, up, using, specialized, vessels, called, icebreakers, icebreakers, are, also, used, to, open, routes, through, the, sea, ice, for, other, vessels, as, the, only, alternative, is, to, find, the, openings, called, polynyas, or, leads, a, widespread, production, of, icebreakers, began, during, the, 19th, century, earlier, designs, simply, had, reinforced, bows, in, a, spoon, like, or, diagonal, shape, to, effectively, crush, the, ice, later, designs, attached, a, forward, propeller, underneath, the, protruding, bow, as, the, typical, rear, propellers, were, incapable, of, effectively, steering, the, ship, through, the, ice, for, aircraft, ice, can, cause, a, number, of, dangers, as, an, aircraft, climbs, it, passes, through, air, layers, of, different, temperature, and, humidity, some, of, which, may, be, conducive, to, ice, formation, if, ice, forms, on, the, wings, or, control, surfaces, this, may, adversely, affect, the, flying, qualities, of, the, aircraft, in, 1919, during, the, first, non, stop, flight, across, the, atlantic, the, british, aviators, captain, john, alcock, and, lieutenant, arthur, whitten, brown, encountered, such, icing, conditions, brown, left, the, cockpit, and, climbed, onto, the, wing, several, times, to, remove, ice, which, was, covering, the, engine, air, intakes, of, the, vickers, vimy, aircraft, they, were, flying, one, vulnerability, effected, by, icing, that, is, associated, with, reciprocating, internal, combustion, engines, is, the, carburetor, as, air, is, sucked, through, the, carburetor, into, the, engine, the, local, air, pressure, is, lowered, which, causes, adiabatic, cooling, thus, in, humid, near, freezing, conditions, the, carburetor, will, be, colder, and, tend, to, ice, up, this, will, block, the, supply, of, air, to, the, engine, and, cause, it, to, fail, between, 1969, and, 1975, 468, such, instances, were, recorded, causing, 75, aircraft, losses, 44, fatalities, and, 202, serious, injuries, thus, carburetor, air, intake, heaters, were, developed, further, reciprocating, engines, with, fuel, injection, do, not, require, carburetors, in, the, first, place, jet, engines, do, not, experience, carb, icing, but, they, can, be, affected, by, the, moisture, inherently, present, in, jet, fuel, freezing, and, forming, ice, crystals, which, can, potentially, clog, up, fuel, intake, to, the, engine, fuel, heaters, and, or, de, icing, additives, are, used, to, address, the, issue, ice, plays, a, central, role, in, winter, recreation, and, in, many, sports, such, as, ice, skating, tour, skating, ice, hockey, bandy, ice, fishing, ice, climbing, curling, broomball, and, sled, racing, on, bobsled, luge, and, skeleton, many, of, the, different, sports, played, on, ice, get, international, attention, every, four, years, during, the, winter, olympic, games, small, boat, like, craft, can, be, mounted, on, blades, and, be, driven, across, the, ice, by, sails, this, sport, is, known, as, ice, yachting, and, it, had, been, practiced, for, centuries, another, vehicular, sport, is, ice, racing, where, drivers, must, speed, on, lake, ice, while, also, controlling, the, skid, of, their, vehicle, similar, in, some, ways, to, dirt, track, racing, the, sport, has, even, been, modified, for, ice, rinks, greenhouse, gas, emissions, from, human, activities, unbalance, the, earth, s, energy, budget, and, so, cause, an, accumulation, of, heat, about, 90, of, that, heat, is, added, to, ocean, heat, content, 1, is, retained, in, the, atmosphere, and, 3, 4, goes, to, melt, major, parts, of, the, cryosphere, between, 1994, and, 2017, 28, trillion, tonnes, of, ice, were, lost, around, the, globe, as, the, result, arctic, sea, ice, decline, accounted, for, the, single, largest, loss, 7, 6, trillion, tonnes, followed, by, the, melting, of, antarctica, s, ice, shelves, 6, 5, trillion, tonnes, the, retreat, of, mountain, glaciers, 6, 1, trillion, tonnes, the, melting, of, the, greenland, ice, sheet, 3, 8, trillion, tonnes, and, finally, the, melting, of, the, antarctic, ice, sheet, 2, 5, trillion, tonnes, and, the, limited, losses, of, the, sea, ice, in, the, southern, ocean, 0, 9, trillion, tonnes, other, than, the, sea, ice, which, already, displaces, water, due, to, archimedes, principle, these, losses, are, a, major, cause, of, sea, level, rise, slr, and, they, are, expected, to, intensify, in, the, future, in, particular, the, melting, of, the, west, antarctic, ice, sheet, may, accelerate, substantially, as, the, floating, ice, shelves, are, lost, and, can, no, longer, buttress, the, glaciers, this, would, trigger, poorly, understood, marine, ice, sheet, instability, processes, which, could, then, increase, the, slr, expected, for, the, end, of, the, century, between, 30, cm, 1, ft, and, 1, m, 3, 1, 2, ft, depending, on, future, warming, by, tens, of, centimeters, more, 1302, ice, loss, in, greenland, and, antarctica, also, produces, large, quantities, of, fresh, meltwater, which, disrupts, the, atlantic, meridional, overturning, circulation, amoc, and, the, southern, ocean, overturning, circulation, respectively, these, two, halves, of, the, thermohaline, circulation, are, very, important, for, the, global, climate, a, continuation, of, high, meltwater, flows, may, cause, a, severe, disruption, up, to, a, point, of, a, collapse, of, either, circulation, or, even, both, of, them, either, event, would, be, considered, an, example, of, tipping, points, in, the, climate, system, because, it, would, be, extremely, difficult, to, reverse, amoc, is, generally, not, expected, to, collapse, during, the, 21st, century, while, there, is, only, limited, knowledge, about, the, southern, ocean, circulation, 1214, another, example, of, ice, related, tipping, point, is, permafrost, thaw, while, the, organic, content, in, the, permafrost, causes, co, 2, and, methane, emissions, once, it, thaws, and, begins, to, decompose, ice, melting, liqufies, the, ground, causing, anything, built, above, the, former, permafrost, to, collapse, by, 2050, the, economic, damages, from, such, infrastructure, loss, are, expected, to, cost, tens, of, billions, of, dollars, in, the, future, the, arctic, ocean, is, likely, to, lose, effectively, all, of, its, sea, ice, during, at, least, some, septembers, the, end, of, the, ice, melting, season, although, some, of, the, ice, would, refreeze, during, the, winter, i, e, an, ice, free, september, is, likely, to, occur, once, in, every, 40, years, if, global, warming, is, at, 1, 5, c, 2, 7, f, but, would, occur, once, in, every, 8, years, at, 2, c, 3, 6, f, and, once, in, every, 1, 5, years, at, 3, c, 5, 4, f, this, would, affect, the, regional, and, global, climate, due, to, the, ice, albedo, feedback, because, ice, is, highly, reflective, of, solar, energy, persistent, sea, ice, cover, lowers, local, temperatures, once, that, ice, cover, melts, the, darker, ocean, waters, begin, to, absorb, more, heat, which, also, helps, to, melt, the, remaining, ice, global, losses, of, sea, ice, between, 1992, and, 2018, almost, all, of, them, in, the, arctic, have, already, had, the, same, impact, as, 10, of, greenhouse, gas, emissions, over, the, same, period, if, all, the, arctic, sea, ice, was, gone, every, year, between, june, and, september, polar, day, when, the, sun, is, constantly, shining, temperatures, in, the, arctic, would, increase, by, over, 1, 5, c, 2, 7, f, while, the, global, temperatures, would, increase, by, around, 0, 19, c, 0, 34, f, by, 2100, at, least, a, quarter, of, mountain, glaciers, outside, of, greenland, and, antarctica, would, melt, and, effectively, all, ice, caps, on, non, polar, mountains, are, likely, to, be, lost, around, 200, years, after, global, warming, reaches, 2, c, 3, 6, f, the, west, antarctic, ice, sheet, is, highly, vulnerable, and, will, likely, disappear, even, if, the, warming, does, not, progress, further, although, it, could, take, around, 2, 000, years, before, its, loss, is, complete, the, greenland, ice, sheet, will, most, likely, be, lost, with, the, sustained, warming, between, 1, 7, c, 3, 1, f, and, 2, 3, c, 4, 1, f, although, its, total, loss, requires, around, 10, 000, years, finally, the, east, antarctic, ice, sheet, will, take, at, least, 10, 000, years, to, melt, entirely, which, requires, a, warming, of, between, 5, c, 9, 0, f, and, 10, c, 18, f, if, all, the, ice, on, earth, melted, it, would, result, in, about, 70, m, 229, ft, 8, in, of, sea, level, rise, with, some, 53, 3, m, 174, ft, 10, in, coming, from, east, antarctica, due, to, isostatic, rebound, the, ice, free, land, would, eventually, become, 301, m, 987, ft, 6, in, higher, in, greenland, and, 494, m, 1, 620, ft, 9, in, in, antarctica, on, average, areas, in, the, center, of, each, landmass, would, become, up, to, 783, m, 2, 568, ft, 11, in, and, 936, m, 3, 070, ft, 10, in, higher, respectively, the, impact, on, global, temperatures, from, losing, west, antartica, mountain, glaciers, and, the, greenland, ice, sheet, is, estimated, at, 0, 05, c, 0, 090, f, 0, 08, c, 0, 14, f, and, 0, 13, c, 0, 23, f, respectively, while, the, lack, of, the, east, antarctic, ice, sheet, would, increase, the, temperatures, by, 0, 6, c, 1, 1, f, the, solid, phases, of, several, other, volatile, substances, are, also, referred, to, as, ices, generally, a, volatile, is, classed, as, an, ice, if, its, melting, or, sublimation, point, lies, above, or, around, 100, k, 173, c, 280, f, assuming, standard, atmospheric, pressure, the, best, known, example, is, dry, ice, the, solid, form, of, carbon, dioxide, its, sublimation, deposition, point, occurs, at, 194, 7, k, 78, 5, c, 109, 2, f, a, magnetic, analogue, of, ice, is, also, realized, in, some, insulating, magnetic, materials, in, which, the, magnetic, moments, mimic, the, position, of, protons, in, water, ice, and, obey, energetic, constraints, similar, to, the, bernal, fowler, ice, rules, arising, from, the, geometrical, frustration, of, the, proton, configuration, in, water, ice, these, materials, are, called, spin, ice
