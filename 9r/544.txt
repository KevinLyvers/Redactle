steel, is, an, alloy, of, iron, and, carbon, with, improved, strength, and, fracture, resistance, compared, to, other, forms, of, iron, because, of, its, high, tensile, strength, and, low, cost, steel, is, one, of, the, most, commonly, manufactured, materials, in, the, world, steel, is, used, in, buildings, as, concrete, reinforcing, rods, in, bridges, infrastructure, tools, ships, trains, cars, bicycles, machines, electrical, appliances, furniture, and, weapons, iron, is, always, the, main, element, in, steel, but, many, other, elements, may, be, present, or, added, stainless, steels, which, are, resistant, to, corrosion, and, oxidation, typically, need, an, additional, 11, chromium, iron, is, the, base, metal, of, steel, depending, on, the, temperature, it, can, take, two, crystalline, forms, allotropic, forms, body, centred, cubic, and, face, centred, cubic, the, interaction, of, the, allotropes, of, iron, with, the, alloying, elements, primarily, carbon, gives, steel, and, cast, iron, their, range, of, unique, properties, in, pure, iron, the, crystal, structure, has, relatively, little, resistance, to, the, iron, atoms, slipping, past, one, another, and, so, pure, iron, is, quite, ductile, or, soft, and, easily, formed, in, steel, small, amounts, of, carbon, other, elements, and, inclusions, within, the, iron, act, as, hardening, agents, that, prevent, the, movement, of, dislocations, the, carbon, in, typical, steel, alloys, may, contribute, up, to, 2, 14, of, its, weight, varying, the, amount, of, carbon, and, many, other, alloying, elements, as, well, as, controlling, their, chemical, and, physical, makeup, in, the, final, steel, either, as, solute, elements, or, as, precipitated, phases, impedes, the, movement, of, the, dislocations, that, make, pure, iron, ductile, and, thus, controls, and, enhances, its, qualities, these, qualities, include, the, hardness, quenching, behaviour, need, for, annealing, tempering, behaviour, yield, strength, and, tensile, strength, of, the, resulting, steel, the, increase, in, steel, s, strength, compared, to, pure, iron, is, possible, only, by, reducing, iron, s, ductility, steel, was, produced, in, bloomery, furnaces, for, thousands, of, years, but, its, large, scale, industrial, use, began, only, after, more, efficient, production, methods, were, devised, in, the, 17th, century, with, the, introduction, of, the, blast, furnace, and, production, of, crucible, steel, this, was, followed, by, the, bessemer, process, in, england, in, the, mid, 19th, century, and, then, by, the, open, hearth, furnace, with, the, invention, of, the, bessemer, process, a, new, era, of, mass, produced, steel, began, mild, steel, replaced, wrought, iron, the, german, states, were, the, major, steel, producers, in, europe, in, the, 19th, century, american, steel, production, was, centered, in, pittsburgh, bethlehem, pennsylvania, and, cleveland, until, the, late, 20th, century, further, refinements, in, the, process, such, as, basic, oxygen, steelmaking, bos, largely, replaced, earlier, methods, by, further, lowering, the, cost, of, production, and, increasing, the, quality, of, the, final, product, today, more, than, 1, 6, billion, tons, of, steel, is, produced, annually, modern, steel, is, generally, identified, by, various, grades, defined, by, assorted, standards, organizations, the, modern, steel, industry, is, one, of, the, largest, manufacturing, industries, in, the, world, but, also, one, of, the, most, energy, and, greenhouse, gas, emission, intense, industries, contributing, 8, of, global, emissions, however, steel, is, also, very, reusable, it, is, one, of, the, world, s, most, recycled, materials, with, a, recycling, rate, of, over, 60, globally, the, noun, steel, originates, from, the, proto, germanic, adjective, stahlij, or, stakhlijan, made, of, steel, which, is, related, to, stahlaz, or, stahlij, standing, firm, the, carbon, content, of, steel, is, between, 0, 02, and, 2, 14, by, weight, for, plain, carbon, steel, iron, carbon, alloys, too, little, carbon, content, leaves, pure, iron, quite, soft, ductile, and, weak, carbon, contents, higher, than, those, of, steel, make, a, brittle, alloy, commonly, called, pig, iron, alloy, steel, is, steel, to, which, other, alloying, elements, have, been, intentionally, added, to, modify, the, characteristics, of, steel, common, alloying, elements, include, manganese, nickel, chromium, molybdenum, boron, titanium, vanadium, tungsten, cobalt, and, niobium, additional, elements, most, frequently, considered, undesirable, are, also, important, in, steel, phosphorus, sulfur, silicon, and, traces, of, oxygen, nitrogen, and, copper, plain, carbon, iron, alloys, with, a, higher, than, 2, 1, carbon, content, are, known, as, cast, iron, with, modern, steelmaking, techniques, such, as, powder, metal, forming, it, is, possible, to, make, very, high, carbon, and, other, alloy, material, steels, but, such, are, not, common, cast, iron, is, not, malleable, even, when, hot, but, it, can, be, formed, by, casting, as, it, has, a, lower, melting, point, than, steel, and, good, castability, properties, certain, compositions, of, cast, iron, while, retaining, the, economies, of, melting, and, casting, can, be, heat, treated, after, casting, to, make, malleable, iron, or, ductile, iron, objects, steel, is, distinguishable, from, wrought, iron, now, largely, obsolete, which, may, contain, a, small, amount, of, carbon, but, large, amounts, of, slag, iron, is, commonly, found, in, the, earth, s, crust, in, the, form, of, an, ore, usually, an, iron, oxide, such, as, magnetite, or, hematite, iron, is, extracted, from, iron, ore, by, removing, the, oxygen, through, its, combination, with, a, preferred, chemical, partner, such, as, carbon, which, is, then, lost, to, the, atmosphere, as, carbon, dioxide, this, process, known, as, smelting, was, first, applied, to, metals, with, lower, melting, points, such, as, tin, which, melts, at, about, 250, c, 482, f, and, copper, which, melts, at, about, 1, 100, c, 2, 010, f, and, the, combination, bronze, which, has, a, melting, point, lower, than, 1, 083, c, 1, 981, f, in, comparison, cast, iron, melts, at, about, 1, 375, c, 2, 507, f, small, quantities, of, iron, were, smelted, in, ancient, times, in, the, solid, state, by, heating, the, ore, in, a, charcoal, fire, and, then, welding, the, clumps, together, with, a, hammer, and, in, the, process, squeezing, out, the, impurities, with, care, the, carbon, content, could, be, controlled, by, moving, it, around, in, the, fire, unlike, copper, and, tin, liquid, or, solid, iron, dissolves, carbon, quite, readily, all, of, these, temperatures, could, be, reached, with, ancient, methods, used, since, the, bronze, age, since, the, oxidation, rate, of, iron, increases, rapidly, beyond, 800, c, 1, 470, f, it, is, important, that, smelting, take, place, in, a, low, oxygen, environment, smelting, using, carbon, to, reduce, iron, oxides, results, in, an, alloy, pig, iron, that, retains, too, much, carbon, to, be, called, steel, the, excess, carbon, and, other, impurities, are, removed, in, a, subsequent, step, other, materials, are, often, added, to, the, iron, carbon, mixture, to, produce, steel, with, the, desired, properties, nickel, and, manganese, in, steel, add, to, its, tensile, strength, and, make, the, austenite, form, of, the, iron, carbon, solution, more, stable, chromium, increases, hardness, and, melting, temperature, and, vanadium, also, increases, hardness, while, making, it, less, prone, to, metal, fatigue, to, inhibit, corrosion, at, least, 11, chromium, can, be, added, to, steel, so, that, a, hard, oxide, forms, on, the, metal, surface, this, is, known, as, stainless, steel, tungsten, slows, the, formation, of, cementite, keeping, carbon, in, the, iron, matrix, and, allowing, martensite, to, preferentially, form, at, slower, quench, rates, resulting, in, high, speed, steel, the, addition, of, lead, and, sulfur, decrease, grain, size, thereby, making, the, steel, easier, to, turn, but, also, more, brittle, and, prone, to, corrosion, such, alloys, are, nevertheless, frequently, used, for, components, such, as, nuts, bolts, and, washers, in, applications, where, toughness, and, corrosion, resistance, are, not, paramount, for, the, most, part, however, p, block, elements, such, as, sulfur, nitrogen, phosphorus, and, lead, are, considered, contaminants, that, make, steel, more, brittle, and, are, therefore, removed, from, steel, during, the, melting, processing, the, density, of, steel, varies, based, on, the, alloying, constituents, but, usually, ranges, between, 7, 750, and, 8, 050, kg, m, 3, 484, and, 503, lb, cu, ft, or, 7, 75, and, 8, 05, g, cm, 3, 4, 48, and, 4, 65, oz, cu, in, even, in, a, narrow, range, of, concentrations, of, mixtures, of, carbon, and, iron, that, make, steel, several, different, metallurgical, structures, with, very, different, properties, can, form, understanding, such, properties, is, essential, to, making, quality, steel, at, room, temperature, the, most, stable, form, of, pure, iron, is, the, body, centred, cubic, bcc, structure, called, alpha, iron, or, iron, it, is, a, fairly, soft, metal, that, can, dissolve, only, a, small, concentration, of, carbon, no, more, than, 0, 005, at, 0, c, 32, f, and, 0, 021, wt, at, 723, c, 1, 333, f, the, inclusion, of, carbon, in, alpha, iron, is, called, ferrite, at, 910, c, pure, iron, transforms, into, a, face, centred, cubic, fcc, structure, called, gamma, iron, or, iron, the, inclusion, of, carbon, in, gamma, iron, is, called, austenite, the, more, open, fcc, structure, of, austenite, can, dissolve, considerably, more, carbon, as, much, as, 2, 1, 38, times, that, of, ferrite, carbon, at, 1, 148, c, 2, 098, f, which, reflects, the, upper, carbon, content, of, steel, beyond, which, is, cast, iron, when, carbon, moves, out, of, solution, with, iron, it, forms, a, very, hard, but, brittle, material, called, cementite, fe, 3, c, when, steels, with, exactly, 0, 8, carbon, known, as, a, eutectoid, steel, are, cooled, the, austenitic, phase, fcc, of, the, mixture, attempts, to, revert, to, the, ferrite, phase, bcc, the, carbon, no, longer, fits, within, the, fcc, austenite, structure, resulting, in, an, excess, of, carbon, one, way, for, carbon, to, leave, the, austenite, is, for, it, to, precipitate, out, of, solution, as, cementite, leaving, behind, a, surrounding, phase, of, bcc, iron, called, ferrite, with, a, small, percentage, of, carbon, in, solution, the, two, cementite, and, ferrite, precipitate, simultaneously, producing, a, layered, structure, called, pearlite, named, for, its, resemblance, to, mother, of, pearl, in, a, hypereutectoid, composition, greater, than, 0, 8, carbon, the, carbon, will, first, precipitate, out, as, large, inclusions, of, cementite, at, the, austenite, grain, boundaries, until, the, percentage, of, carbon, in, the, grains, has, decreased, to, the, eutectoid, composition, 0, 8, carbon, at, which, point, the, pearlite, structure, forms, for, steels, that, have, less, than, 0, 8, carbon, hypoeutectoid, ferrite, will, first, form, within, the, grains, until, the, remaining, composition, rises, to, 0, 8, of, carbon, at, which, point, the, pearlite, structure, will, form, no, large, inclusions, of, cementite, will, form, at, the, boundaries, in, hypoeutectoid, steel, the, above, assumes, that, the, cooling, process, is, very, slow, allowing, enough, time, for, the, carbon, to, migrate, as, the, rate, of, cooling, is, increased, the, carbon, will, have, less, time, to, migrate, to, form, carbide, at, the, grain, boundaries, but, will, have, increasingly, large, amounts, of, pearlite, of, a, finer, and, finer, structure, within, the, grains, hence, the, carbide, is, more, widely, dispersed, and, acts, to, prevent, slip, of, defects, within, those, grains, resulting, in, hardening, of, the, steel, at, the, very, high, cooling, rates, produced, by, quenching, the, carbon, has, no, time, to, migrate, but, is, locked, within, the, face, centred, austenite, and, forms, martensite, martensite, is, a, highly, strained, and, stressed, supersaturated, form, of, carbon, and, iron, and, is, exceedingly, hard, but, brittle, depending, on, the, carbon, content, the, martensitic, phase, takes, different, forms, below, 0, 2, carbon, it, takes, on, a, ferrite, bcc, crystal, form, but, at, higher, carbon, content, it, takes, a, body, centred, tetragonal, bct, structure, there, is, no, thermal, activation, energy, for, the, transformation, from, austenite, to, martensite, there, is, no, compositional, change, so, the, atoms, generally, retain, their, same, neighbours, martensite, has, a, lower, density, it, expands, during, the, cooling, than, does, austenite, so, that, the, transformation, between, them, results, in, a, change, of, volume, in, this, case, expansion, occurs, internal, stresses, from, this, expansion, generally, take, the, form, of, compression, on, the, crystals, of, martensite, and, tension, on, the, remaining, ferrite, with, a, fair, amount, of, shear, on, both, constituents, if, quenching, is, done, improperly, the, internal, stresses, can, cause, a, part, to, shatter, as, it, cools, at, the, very, least, they, cause, internal, work, hardening, and, other, microscopic, imperfections, it, is, common, for, quench, cracks, to, form, when, steel, is, water, quenched, although, they, may, not, always, be, visible, there, are, many, types, of, heat, treating, processes, available, to, steel, the, most, common, are, annealing, quenching, and, tempering, annealing, is, the, process, of, heating, the, steel, to, a, sufficiently, high, temperature, to, relieve, local, internal, stresses, it, does, not, create, a, general, softening, of, the, product, but, only, locally, relieves, strains, and, stresses, locked, up, within, the, material, annealing, goes, through, three, phases, recovery, recrystallization, and, grain, growth, the, temperature, required, to, anneal, a, particular, steel, depends, on, the, type, of, annealing, to, be, achieved, and, the, alloying, constituents, quenching, involves, heating, the, steel, to, create, the, austenite, phase, then, quenching, it, in, water, or, oil, this, rapid, cooling, results, in, a, hard, but, brittle, martensitic, structure, the, steel, is, then, tempered, which, is, just, a, specialized, type, of, annealing, to, reduce, brittleness, in, this, application, the, annealing, tempering, process, transforms, some, of, the, martensite, into, cementite, or, spheroidite, and, hence, it, reduces, the, internal, stresses, and, defects, the, result, is, a, more, ductile, and, fracture, resistant, steel, when, iron, is, smelted, from, its, ore, it, contains, more, carbon, than, is, desirable, to, become, steel, it, must, be, reprocessed, to, reduce, the, carbon, to, the, correct, amount, at, which, point, other, elements, can, be, added, in, the, past, steel, facilities, would, cast, the, raw, steel, product, into, ingots, which, would, be, stored, until, use, in, further, refinement, processes, that, resulted, in, the, finished, product, in, modern, facilities, the, initial, product, is, close, to, the, final, composition, and, is, continuously, cast, into, long, slabs, cut, and, shaped, into, bars, and, extrusions, and, heat, treated, to, produce, a, final, product, today, approximately, 96, of, steel, is, continuously, cast, while, only, 4, is, produced, as, ingots, the, ingots, are, then, heated, in, a, soaking, pit, and, hot, rolled, into, slabs, billets, or, blooms, slabs, are, hot, or, cold, rolled, into, sheet, metal, or, plates, billets, are, hot, or, cold, rolled, into, bars, rods, and, wire, blooms, are, hot, or, cold, rolled, into, structural, steel, such, as, i, beams, and, rails, in, modern, steel, mills, these, processes, often, occur, in, one, assembly, line, with, ore, coming, in, and, finished, steel, products, coming, out, sometimes, after, a, steel, s, final, rolling, it, is, heat, treated, for, strength, however, this, is, relatively, rare, steel, was, known, in, antiquity, and, was, produced, in, bloomeries, and, crucibles, the, earliest, known, production, of, steel, is, seen, in, pieces, of, ironware, excavated, from, an, archaeological, site, in, anatolia, kaman, kaleh, y, k, which, are, nearly, 4, 000, years, old, dating, from, 1800, bc, wootz, steel, was, developed, in, southern, india, and, sri, lanka, in, the, 1st, millennium, bce, metal, production, sites, in, sri, lanka, employed, wind, furnaces, driven, by, the, monsoon, winds, capable, of, producing, high, carbon, steel, large, scale, wootz, steel, production, in, india, using, crucibles, occurred, by, the, sixth, century, bc, the, pioneering, precursor, to, modern, steel, production, and, metallurgy, high, carbon, steel, was, produced, in, britain, at, broxmouth, hillfort, from, 490, 375, bc, and, ultrahigh, carbon, steel, was, produced, in, the, netherlands, from, the, 2nd, 4th, centuries, ad, the, roman, author, horace, identifies, steel, weapons, such, as, the, falcata, in, the, iberian, peninsula, while, noric, steel, was, used, by, the, roman, military, the, chinese, of, the, warring, states, period, 403, 221, bc, had, quench, hardened, steel, while, chinese, of, the, han, dynasty, 202, bc, ad, 220, created, steel, by, melting, together, wrought, iron, with, cast, iron, thus, producing, a, carbon, intermediate, steel, by, the, 1st, century, ad, there, is, evidence, that, carbon, steel, was, made, in, western, tanzania, by, the, ancestors, of, the, haya, people, as, early, as, 2, 000, years, ago, by, a, complex, process, of, pre, heating, allowing, temperatures, inside, a, furnace, to, reach, 1300, to, 1400, c, evidence, of, the, earliest, production, of, high, carbon, steel, in, south, asia, is, found, in, kodumanal, in, tamil, nadu, the, golconda, area, in, andhra, pradesh, and, karnataka, regions, of, india, as, well, as, in, samanalawewa, and, dehigaha, alakanda, regions, of, sri, lanka, this, came, to, be, known, as, wootz, steel, produced, in, south, india, by, about, the, sixth, century, bc, and, exported, globally, the, steel, technology, existed, prior, to, 326, bc, in, the, region, as, they, are, mentioned, in, literature, of, sangam, tamil, arabic, and, latin, as, the, finest, steel, in, the, world, exported, to, the, romans, egyptian, chinese, and, arab, worlds, at, that, time, what, they, called, seric, iron, a, 200, bc, tamil, trade, guild, in, tissamaharama, in, the, south, east, of, sri, lanka, brought, with, them, some, of, the, oldest, iron, and, steel, artifacts, and, production, processes, to, the, island, from, the, classical, period, the, chinese, and, locals, in, anuradhapura, sri, lanka, had, also, adopted, the, production, methods, of, creating, wootz, steel, from, the, chera, dynasty, tamils, of, south, india, by, the, 5th, century, ad, in, sri, lanka, this, early, steel, making, method, employed, a, unique, wind, furnace, driven, by, the, monsoon, winds, capable, of, producing, high, carbon, steel, since, the, technology, was, acquired, from, the, tamilians, from, south, india, the, origin, of, steel, technology, in, india, can, be, conservatively, estimated, at, 400, 500, bc, the, manufacture, of, wootz, steel, and, damascus, steel, famous, for, its, durability, and, ability, to, hold, an, edge, may, have, been, taken, by, the, arabs, from, persia, who, took, it, from, india, it, was, originally, created, from, several, different, materials, including, various, trace, elements, apparently, ultimately, from, the, writings, of, zosimos, of, panopolis, in, 327, bc, alexander, the, great, was, rewarded, by, the, defeated, king, porus, not, with, gold, or, silver, but, with, 30, pounds, of, steel, a, recent, study, has, speculated, that, carbon, nanotubes, were, included, in, its, structure, which, might, explain, some, of, its, legendary, qualities, though, given, the, technology, of, that, time, such, qualities, were, produced, by, chance, rather, than, by, design, natural, wind, was, used, where, the, soil, containing, iron, was, heated, by, the, use, of, wood, the, ancient, sinhalese, managed, to, extract, a, ton, of, steel, for, every, 2, tons, of, soil, a, remarkable, feat, at, the, time, one, such, furnace, was, found, in, samanalawewa, and, archaeologists, were, able, to, produce, steel, as, the, ancients, did, crucible, steel, formed, by, slowly, heating, and, cooling, pure, iron, and, carbon, typically, in, the, form, of, charcoal, in, a, crucible, was, produced, in, merv, by, the, 9th, to, 10th, century, ad, in, the, 11th, century, there, is, evidence, of, the, production, of, steel, in, song, china, using, two, techniques, a, berganesque, method, that, produced, inferior, inhomogeneous, steel, and, a, precursor, to, the, modern, bessemer, process, that, used, partial, decarburization, via, repeated, forging, under, a, cold, blast, since, the, 17th, century, the, first, step, in, european, steel, production, has, been, the, smelting, of, iron, ore, into, pig, iron, in, a, blast, furnace, originally, employing, charcoal, modern, methods, use, coke, which, has, proven, more, economical, in, these, processes, pig, iron, made, from, raw, iron, ore, was, refined, fined, in, a, finery, forge, to, produce, bar, iron, which, was, then, used, in, steel, making, the, production, of, steel, by, the, cementation, process, was, described, in, a, treatise, published, in, prague, in, 1574, and, was, in, use, in, nuremberg, from, 1601, a, similar, process, for, case, hardening, armor, and, files, was, described, in, a, book, published, in, naples, in, 1589, the, process, was, introduced, to, england, in, about, 1614, and, used, to, produce, such, steel, by, sir, basil, brooke, at, coalbrookdale, during, the, 1610s, the, raw, material, for, this, process, were, bars, of, iron, during, the, 17th, century, it, was, realized, that, the, best, steel, came, from, oregrounds, iron, of, a, region, north, of, stockholm, sweden, this, was, still, the, usual, raw, material, source, in, the, 19th, century, almost, as, long, as, the, process, was, used, crucible, steel, is, steel, that, has, been, melted, in, a, crucible, rather, than, having, been, forged, with, the, result, that, it, is, more, homogeneous, most, previous, furnaces, could, not, reach, high, enough, temperatures, to, melt, the, steel, the, early, modern, crucible, steel, industry, resulted, from, the, invention, of, benjamin, huntsman, in, the, 1740s, blister, steel, made, as, above, was, melted, in, a, crucible, or, in, a, furnace, and, cast, usually, into, ingots, the, modern, era, in, steelmaking, began, with, the, introduction, of, henry, bessemer, s, process, in, 1855, the, raw, material, for, which, was, pig, iron, his, method, let, him, produce, steel, in, large, quantities, cheaply, thus, mild, steel, came, to, be, used, for, most, purposes, for, which, wrought, iron, was, formerly, used, the, gilchrist, thomas, process, or, basic, bessemer, process, was, an, improvement, to, the, bessemer, process, made, by, lining, the, converter, with, a, basic, material, to, remove, phosphorus, another, 19th, century, steelmaking, process, was, the, siemens, martin, process, which, complemented, the, bessemer, process, it, consisted, of, co, melting, bar, iron, or, steel, scrap, with, pig, iron, these, methods, of, steel, production, were, rendered, obsolete, by, the, linz, donawitz, process, of, basic, oxygen, steelmaking, bos, developed, in, 1952, and, other, oxygen, steel, making, methods, basic, oxygen, steelmaking, is, superior, to, previous, steelmaking, methods, because, the, oxygen, pumped, into, the, furnace, limited, impurities, primarily, nitrogen, that, previously, had, entered, from, the, air, used, and, because, with, respect, to, the, open, hearth, process, the, same, quantity, of, steel, from, a, bos, process, is, manufactured, in, one, twelfth, the, time, today, electric, arc, furnaces, eaf, are, a, common, method, of, reprocessing, scrap, metal, to, create, new, steel, they, can, also, be, used, for, converting, pig, iron, to, steel, but, they, use, a, lot, of, electrical, energy, about, 440, kwh, per, metric, ton, and, are, thus, generally, only, economical, when, there, is, a, plentiful, supply, of, cheap, electricity, the, steel, industry, is, often, considered, an, indicator, of, economic, progress, because, of, the, critical, role, played, by, steel, in, infrastructural, and, overall, economic, development, in, 1980, there, were, more, than, 500, 000, u, s, steelworkers, by, 2000, the, number, of, steelworkers, had, fallen, to, 224, 000, the, economic, boom, in, china, and, india, caused, a, massive, increase, in, the, demand, for, steel, between, 2000, and, 2005, world, steel, demand, increased, by, 6, since, 2000, several, indian, and, chinese, steel, firms, have, expanded, to, meet, demand, such, as, tata, steel, which, bought, corus, group, in, 2007, baosteel, group, and, shagang, group, as, of, 2017, though, arcelormittal, is, the, world, s, largest, steel, producer, in, 2005, the, british, geological, survey, stated, china, was, the, top, steel, producer, with, about, one, third, of, the, world, share, japan, russia, and, the, united, states, were, second, third, and, fourth, respectively, according, to, the, survey, the, large, production, capacity, of, steel, results, also, in, a, significant, amount, of, carbon, dioxide, emissions, inherent, related, to, the, main, production, route, at, the, end, of, 2008, the, steel, industry, faced, a, sharp, downturn, that, led, to, many, cut, backs, in, 2021, it, was, estimated, that, around, 7, of, the, global, greenhouse, gas, emissions, resulted, from, the, steel, industry, reduction, of, these, emissions, are, expected, to, come, from, a, shift, in, the, main, production, route, using, cokes, more, recycling, of, steel, and, the, application, of, carbon, capture, and, storage, or, carbon, capture, and, utilization, technology, steel, is, one, of, the, world, s, most, recycled, materials, with, a, recycling, rate, of, over, 60, globally, in, the, united, states, alone, over, 82, 000, 000, metric, tons, 81, 000, 000, long, tons, 90, 000, 000, short, tons, were, recycled, in, the, year, 2008, for, an, overall, recycling, rate, of, 83, as, more, steel, is, produced, than, is, scrapped, the, amount, of, recycled, raw, materials, is, about, 40, of, the, total, of, steel, produced, in, 2016, 1, 628, 000, 000, tonnes, 1, 602, 10, 9, long, tons, 1, 795, 10, 9, short, tons, of, crude, steel, was, produced, globally, with, 630, 000, 000, tonnes, 620, 000, 000, long, tons, 690, 000, 000, short, tons, recycled, modern, steels, are, made, with, varying, combinations, of, alloy, metals, to, fulfill, many, purposes, carbon, steel, composed, simply, of, iron, and, carbon, accounts, for, 90, of, steel, production, low, alloy, steel, is, alloyed, with, other, elements, usually, molybdenum, manganese, chromium, or, nickel, in, amounts, of, up, to, 10, by, weight, to, improve, the, hardenability, of, thick, sections, high, strength, low, alloy, steel, has, small, additions, usually, 2, by, weight, of, other, elements, typically, 1, 5, manganese, to, provide, additional, strength, for, a, modest, price, increase, recent, corporate, average, fuel, economy, cafe, regulations, have, given, rise, to, a, new, variety, of, steel, known, as, advanced, high, strength, steel, ahss, this, material, is, both, strong, and, ductile, so, that, vehicle, structures, can, maintain, their, current, safety, levels, while, using, less, material, there, are, several, commercially, available, grades, of, ahss, such, as, dual, phase, steel, which, is, heat, treated, to, contain, both, a, ferritic, and, martensitic, microstructure, to, produce, a, formable, high, strength, steel, transformation, induced, plasticity, trip, steel, involves, special, alloying, and, heat, treatments, to, stabilize, amounts, of, austenite, at, room, temperature, in, normally, austenite, free, low, alloy, ferritic, steels, by, applying, strain, the, austenite, undergoes, a, phase, transition, to, martensite, without, the, addition, of, heat, twinning, induced, plasticity, twip, steel, uses, a, specific, type, of, strain, to, increase, the, effectiveness, of, work, hardening, on, the, alloy, carbon, steels, are, often, galvanized, through, hot, dip, or, electroplating, in, zinc, for, protection, against, rust, stainless, steel, contains, a, minimum, of, 11, chromium, often, combined, with, nickel, to, resist, corrosion, some, stainless, steels, such, as, the, ferritic, stainless, steels, are, magnetic, while, others, such, as, the, austenitic, are, nonmagnetic, corrosion, resistant, steels, are, abbreviated, as, cres, alloy, steels, are, plain, carbon, steels, in, which, small, amounts, of, alloying, elements, like, chromium, and, vanadium, have, been, added, some, more, modern, steels, include, tool, steels, which, are, alloyed, with, large, amounts, of, tungsten, and, cobalt, or, other, elements, to, maximize, solution, hardening, this, also, allows, the, use, of, precipitation, hardening, and, improves, the, alloy, s, temperature, resistance, tool, steel, is, generally, used, in, axes, drills, and, other, devices, that, need, a, sharp, long, lasting, cutting, edge, other, special, purpose, alloys, include, weathering, steels, such, as, cor, ten, which, weather, by, acquiring, a, stable, rusted, surface, and, so, can, be, used, un, painted, maraging, steel, is, alloyed, with, nickel, and, other, elements, but, unlike, most, steel, contains, little, carbon, 0, 01, this, creates, a, very, strong, but, still, malleable, steel, eglin, steel, uses, a, combination, of, over, a, dozen, different, elements, in, varying, amounts, to, create, a, relatively, low, cost, steel, for, use, in, bunker, buster, weapons, hadfield, steel, named, after, robert, hadfield, or, manganese, steel, contains, 12, 14, manganese, which, when, abraded, strain, hardens, to, form, a, very, hard, skin, which, resists, wearing, uses, of, this, particular, alloy, include, tank, tracks, bulldozer, blade, edges, and, cutting, blades, on, the, jaws, of, life, most, of, the, more, commonly, used, steel, alloys, are, categorized, into, various, grades, by, standards, organizations, for, example, the, society, of, automotive, engineers, has, a, series, of, grades, defining, many, types, of, steel, the, american, society, for, testing, and, materials, has, a, separate, set, of, standards, which, define, alloys, such, as, a36, steel, the, most, commonly, used, structural, steel, in, the, united, states, the, jis, also, defines, a, series, of, steel, grades, that, are, being, used, extensively, in, japan, as, well, as, in, developing, countries, iron, and, steel, are, used, widely, in, the, construction, of, roads, railways, other, infrastructure, appliances, and, buildings, most, large, modern, structures, such, as, stadiums, and, skyscrapers, bridges, and, airports, are, supported, by, a, steel, skeleton, even, those, with, a, concrete, structure, employ, steel, for, reinforcing, it, sees, widespread, use, in, major, appliances, and, cars, despite, the, growth, in, usage, of, aluminium, steel, is, still, the, main, material, for, car, bodies, steel, is, used, in, a, variety, of, other, construction, materials, such, as, bolts, nails, and, screws, and, other, household, products, and, cooking, utensils, other, common, applications, include, shipbuilding, pipelines, mining, offshore, construction, aerospace, white, goods, e, g, washing, machines, heavy, equipment, such, as, bulldozers, office, furniture, steel, wool, tool, and, armour, in, the, form, of, personal, vests, or, vehicle, armour, better, known, as, rolled, homogeneous, armour, in, this, role, before, the, introduction, of, the, bessemer, process, and, other, modern, production, techniques, steel, was, expensive, and, was, only, used, where, no, cheaper, alternative, existed, particularly, for, the, cutting, edge, of, knives, razors, swords, and, other, items, where, a, hard, sharp, edge, was, needed, it, was, also, used, for, springs, including, those, used, in, clocks, and, watches, with, the, advent, of, faster, and, cheaper, production, methods, steel, has, become, easier, to, obtain, and, much, cheaper, it, has, replaced, wrought, iron, for, a, multitude, of, purposes, however, the, availability, of, plastics, in, the, latter, part, of, the, 20th, century, allowed, these, materials, to, replace, steel, in, some, applications, due, to, their, lower, fabrication, cost, and, weight, carbon, fiber, is, replacing, steel, in, some, cost, insensitive, applications, such, as, sports, equipment, and, high, end, automobiles, steel, manufactured, after, world, war, ii, became, contaminated, with, radionuclides, by, nuclear, weapons, testing, low, background, steel, steel, manufactured, prior, to, 1945, is, used, for, certain, radiation, sensitive, applications, such, as, geiger, counters, and, radiation, shielding
