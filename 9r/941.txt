kirchhoff, s, circuit, laws, are, two, equalities, that, deal, with, the, current, and, potential, difference, commonly, known, as, voltage, in, the, lumped, element, model, of, electrical, circuits, they, were, first, described, in, 1845, by, german, physicist, gustav, kirchhoff, this, generalized, the, work, of, georg, ohm, and, preceded, the, work, of, james, clerk, maxwell, widely, used, in, electrical, engineering, they, are, also, called, kirchhoff, s, rules, or, simply, kirchhoff, s, laws, these, laws, can, be, applied, in, time, and, frequency, domains, and, form, the, basis, for, network, analysis, both, of, kirchhoff, s, laws, can, be, understood, as, corollaries, of, maxwell, s, equations, in, the, low, frequency, limit, they, are, accurate, for, dc, circuits, and, for, ac, circuits, at, frequencies, where, the, wavelengths, of, electromagnetic, radiation, are, very, large, compared, to, the, circuits, this, law, also, called, kirchhoff, s, first, law, or, kirchhoff, s, junction, rule, states, that, for, any, node, junction, in, an, electrical, circuit, the, sum, of, currents, flowing, into, that, node, is, equal, to, the, sum, of, currents, flowing, out, of, that, node, or, equivalently, the, algebraic, sum, of, currents, in, a, network, of, conductors, meeting, at, a, point, is, zero, recalling, that, current, is, a, signed, positive, or, negative, quantity, reflecting, direction, towards, or, away, from, a, node, this, principle, can, be, succinctly, stated, as, i, 1, n, i, i, 0, displaystyle, sum, i, 1, n, i, i, 0, where, n, is, the, total, number, of, branches, with, currents, flowing, towards, or, away, from, the, node, kirchhoff, s, circuit, laws, were, originally, obtained, from, experimental, results, however, the, current, law, can, be, viewed, as, an, extension, of, the, conservation, of, charge, since, charge, is, the, product, of, current, and, the, time, the, current, has, been, flowing, if, the, net, charge, in, a, region, is, constant, the, current, law, will, hold, on, the, boundaries, of, the, region, this, means, that, the, current, law, relies, on, the, fact, that, the, net, charge, in, the, wires, and, components, is, constant, a, matrix, version, of, kirchhoff, s, current, law, is, the, basis, of, most, circuit, simulation, software, such, as, spice, the, current, law, is, used, with, ohm, s, law, to, perform, nodal, analysis, the, current, law, is, applicable, to, any, lumped, network, irrespective, of, the, nature, of, the, network, whether, unilateral, or, bilateral, active, or, passive, linear, or, non, linear, this, law, also, called, kirchhoff, s, second, law, or, kirchhoff, s, loop, rule, states, the, following, the, directed, sum, of, the, potential, differences, voltages, around, any, closed, loop, is, zero, similarly, to, kirchhoff, s, current, law, the, voltage, law, can, be, stated, as, i, 1, n, v, i, 0, displaystyle, sum, i, 1, n, v, i, 0, here, n, is, the, total, number, of, voltages, measured, a, similar, derivation, can, be, found, in, the, feynman, lectures, on, physics, volume, ii, chapter, 22, ac, circuits, consider, some, arbitrary, circuit, approximate, the, circuit, with, lumped, elements, so, that, time, varying, magnetic, fields, are, contained, to, each, component, and, the, field, in, the, region, exterior, to, the, circuit, is, negligible, based, on, this, assumption, the, maxwell, faraday, equation, reveals, that, e, b, t, 0, displaystyle, nabla, times, mathbf, e, frac, partial, mathbf, b, partial, t, mathbf, 0, in, the, exterior, region, if, each, of, the, components, has, a, finite, volume, then, the, exterior, region, is, simply, connected, and, thus, the, electric, field, is, conservative, in, that, region, therefore, for, any, loop, in, the, circuit, we, find, that, i, v, i, i, p, i, e, d, l, e, d, l, 0, displaystyle, sum, i, v, i, sum, i, int, mathcal, p, i, mathbf, e, cdot, mathrm, d, mathbf, l, oint, mathbf, e, cdot, mathrm, d, mathbf, l, 0, where, p, i, textstyle, mathcal, p, i, are, paths, around, the, exterior, of, each, of, the, components, from, one, terminal, to, another, note, that, this, derivation, uses, the, following, definition, for, the, voltage, rise, from, a, displaystyle, a, to, b, displaystyle, b, v, a, b, p, a, b, e, d, l, displaystyle, v, a, to, b, int, mathcal, p, a, to, b, mathbf, e, cdot, mathrm, d, mathbf, l, however, the, electric, potential, and, thus, voltage, can, be, defined, in, other, ways, such, as, via, the, helmholtz, decomposition, in, the, low, frequency, limit, the, voltage, drop, around, any, loop, is, zero, this, includes, imaginary, loops, arranged, arbitrarily, in, space, not, limited, to, the, loops, delineated, by, the, circuit, elements, and, conductors, in, the, low, frequency, limit, this, is, a, corollary, of, faraday, s, law, of, induction, which, is, one, of, maxwell, s, equations, this, has, practical, application, in, situations, involving, static, electricity, kirchhoff, s, circuit, laws, are, the, result, of, the, lumped, element, model, and, both, depend, on, the, model, being, applicable, to, the, circuit, in, question, when, the, model, is, not, applicable, the, laws, do, not, apply, the, current, law, is, dependent, on, the, assumption, that, the, net, charge, in, any, wire, junction, or, lumped, component, is, constant, whenever, the, electric, field, between, parts, of, the, circuit, is, non, negligible, such, as, when, two, wires, are, capacitively, coupled, this, may, not, be, the, case, this, occurs, in, high, frequency, ac, circuits, where, the, lumped, element, model, is, no, longer, applicable, for, example, in, a, transmission, line, the, charge, density, in, the, conductor, may, be, constantly, changing, on, the, other, hand, the, voltage, law, relies, on, the, fact, that, the, actions, of, time, varying, magnetic, fields, are, confined, to, individual, components, such, as, inductors, in, reality, the, induced, electric, field, produced, by, an, inductor, is, not, confined, but, the, leaked, fields, are, often, negligible, the, lumped, element, approximation, for, a, circuit, is, accurate, at, low, frequencies, at, higher, frequencies, leaked, fluxes, and, varying, charge, densities, in, conductors, become, significant, to, an, extent, it, is, possible, to, still, model, such, circuits, using, parasitic, components, if, frequencies, are, too, high, it, may, be, more, appropriate, to, simulate, the, fields, directly, using, finite, element, modelling, or, other, techniques, to, model, circuits, so, that, both, laws, can, still, be, used, it, is, important, to, understand, the, distinction, between, physical, circuit, elements, and, the, ideal, lumped, elements, for, example, a, wire, is, not, an, ideal, conductor, unlike, an, ideal, conductor, wires, can, inductively, and, capacitively, couple, to, each, other, and, to, themselves, and, have, a, finite, propagation, delay, real, conductors, can, be, modeled, in, terms, of, lumped, elements, by, considering, parasitic, capacitances, distributed, between, the, conductors, to, model, capacitive, coupling, or, parasitic, mutual, inductances, to, model, inductive, coupling, wires, also, have, some, self, inductance, assume, an, electric, network, consisting, of, two, voltage, sources, and, three, resistors, according, to, the, first, law, i, 1, i, 2, i, 3, 0, displaystyle, i, 1, i, 2, i, 3, 0, applying, the, second, law, to, the, closed, circuit, s, 1, and, substituting, for, voltage, using, ohm, s, law, gives, r, 2, i, 2, e, 1, r, 1, i, 1, 0, displaystyle, r, 2, i, 2, mathcal, e, 1, r, 1, i, 1, 0, the, second, law, again, combined, with, ohm, s, law, applied, to, the, closed, circuit, s, 2, gives, r, 3, i, 3, e, 2, e, 1, r, 2, i, 2, 0, displaystyle, r, 3, i, 3, mathcal, e, 2, mathcal, e, 1, r, 2, i, 2, 0, this, yields, a, system, of, linear, equations, in, i, 1, i, 2, i, 3, i, 1, i, 2, i, 3, 0, r, 2, i, 2, e, 1, r, 1, i, 1, 0, r, 3, i, 3, e, 2, e, 1, r, 2, i, 2, 0, displaystyle, begin, cases, i, 1, i, 2, i, 3, 0, r, 2, i, 2, mathcal, e, 1, r, 1, i, 1, 0, r, 3, i, 3, mathcal, e, 2, mathcal, e, 1, r, 2, i, 2, 0, end, cases, which, is, equivalent, to, i, 1, i, 2, i, 3, 0, r, 1, i, 1, r, 2, i, 2, 0, i, 3, e, 1, 0, i, 1, r, 2, i, 2, r, 3, i, 3, e, 1, e, 2, displaystyle, begin, cases, i, 1, i, 2, i, 3,

which, means, the, assumed, direction, of, i, 3, was, incorrect, and, i, 3, is, actually, flowing, in, the, direction, opposite, to, the, red, arrow, labeled, i, 3, the, current, in, r, 3, flows,
