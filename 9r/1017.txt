in, continuum, mechanics, stress, is, a, physical, quantity, that, describes, forces, present, during, deformation, for, example, an, object, being, pulled, apart, such, as, a, stretched, elastic, band, is, subject, to, tensile, stress, and, may, undergo, elongation, an, object, being, pushed, together, such, as, a, crumpled, sponge, is, subject, to, compressive, stress, and, may, undergo, shortening, the, greater, the, force, and, the, smaller, the, cross, sectional, area, of, the, body, on, which, it, acts, the, greater, the, stress, stress, has, dimension, of, force, per, area, with, si, units, of, newtons, per, square, meter, n, m, 2, or, pascal, pa, stress, expresses, the, internal, forces, that, neighbouring, particles, of, a, continuous, material, exert, on, each, other, while, strain, is, the, measure, of, the, relative, deformation, of, the, material, for, example, when, a, solid, vertical, bar, is, supporting, an, overhead, weight, each, particle, in, the, bar, pushes, on, the, particles, immediately, below, it, when, a, liquid, is, in, a, closed, container, under, pressure, each, particle, gets, pushed, against, by, all, the, surrounding, particles, the, container, walls, and, the, pressure, inducing, surface, such, as, a, piston, push, against, them, in, newtonian, reaction, these, macroscopic, forces, are, actually, the, net, result, of, a, very, large, number, of, intermolecular, forces, and, collisions, between, the, particles, in, those, molecules, stress, is, frequently, represented, by, a, lowercase, greek, letter, sigma, strain, inside, a, material, may, arise, by, various, mechanisms, such, as, stress, as, applied, by, external, forces, to, the, bulk, material, like, gravity, or, to, its, surface, like, contact, forces, external, pressure, or, friction, any, strain, deformation, of, a, solid, material, generates, an, internal, elastic, stress, analogous, to, the, reaction, force, of, a, spring, that, tends, to, restore, the, material, to, its, original, non, deformed, state, in, liquids, and, gases, only, deformations, that, change, the, volume, generate, persistent, elastic, stress, if, the, deformation, changes, gradually, with, time, even, in, fluids, there, will, usually, be, some, viscous, stress, opposing, that, change, elastic, and, viscous, stresses, are, usually, combined, under, the, name, mechanical, stress, significant, stress, may, exist, even, when, deformation, is, negligible, or, non, existent, a, common, assumption, when, modeling, the, flow, of, water, stress, may, exist, in, the, absence, of, external, forces, such, built, in, stress, is, important, for, example, in, prestressed, concrete, and, tempered, glass, stress, may, also, be, imposed, on, a, material, without, the, application, of, net, forces, for, example, by, changes, in, temperature, or, chemical, composition, or, by, external, electromagnetic, fields, as, in, piezoelectric, and, magnetostrictive, materials, the, relation, between, mechanical, stress, strain, and, the, strain, rate, can, be, quite, complicated, although, a, linear, approximation, may, be, adequate, in, practice, if, the, quantities, are, sufficiently, small, stress, that, exceeds, certain, strength, limits, of, the, material, will, result, in, permanent, deformation, such, as, plastic, flow, fracture, cavitation, or, even, change, its, crystal, structure, and, chemical, composition, humans, have, known, about, stress, inside, materials, since, ancient, times, until, the, 17th, century, this, understanding, was, largely, intuitive, and, empirical, though, this, did, not, prevent, the, development, of, relatively, advanced, technologies, like, the, composite, bow, and, glass, blowing, over, several, millennia, architects, and, builders, in, particular, learned, how, to, put, together, carefully, shaped, wood, beams, and, stone, blocks, to, withstand, transmit, and, distribute, stress, in, the, most, effective, manner, with, ingenious, devices, such, as, the, capitals, arches, cupolas, trusses, and, the, flying, buttresses, of, gothic, cathedrals, ancient, and, medieval, architects, did, develop, some, geometrical, methods, and, simple, formulas, to, compute, the, proper, sizes, of, pillars, and, beams, but, the, scientific, understanding, of, stress, became, possible, only, after, the, necessary, tools, were, invented, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, galileo, galilei, s, rigorous, experimental, method, ren, descartes, s, coordinates, and, analytic, geometry, and, newton, s, laws, of, motion, and, equilibrium, and, calculus, of, infinitesimals, with, those, tools, augustin, louis, cauchy, was, able, to, give, the, first, rigorous, and, general, mathematical, model, of, a, deformed, elastic, body, by, introducing, the, notions, of, stress, and, strain, cauchy, observed, that, the, force, across, an, imaginary, surface, was, a, linear, function, of, its, normal, vector, and, moreover, that, it, must, be, a, symmetric, function, with, zero, total, momentum, the, understanding, of, stress, in, liquids, started, with, newton, who, provided, a, differential, formula, for, friction, forces, shear, stress, in, parallel, laminar, flow, stress, is, defined, as, the, force, across, a, small, boundary, per, unit, area, of, that, boundary, for, all, orientations, of, the, boundary, derived, from, a, fundamental, physical, quantity, force, and, a, purely, geometrical, quantity, area, stress, is, also, a, fundamental, quantity, like, velocity, torque, or, energy, that, can, be, quantified, and, analyzed, without, explicit, consideration, of, the, nature, of, the, material, or, of, its, physical, causes, following, the, basic, premises, of, continuum, mechanics, stress, is, a, macroscopic, concept, namely, the, particles, considered, in, its, definition, and, analysis, should, be, just, small, enough, to, be, treated, as, homogeneous, in, composition, and, state, but, still, large, enough, to, ignore, quantum, effects, and, the, detailed, motions, of, molecules, thus, the, force, between, two, particles, is, actually, the, average, of, a, very, large, number, of, atomic, forces, between, their, molecules, and, physical, quantities, like, mass, velocity, and, forces, that, act, through, the, bulk, of, three, dimensional, bodies, like, gravity, are, assumed, to, be, smoothly, distributed, over, them, 90, 106, depending, on, the, context, one, may, also, assume, that, the, particles, are, large, enough, to, allow, the, averaging, out, of, other, microscopic, features, like, the, grains, of, a, metal, rod, or, the, fibers, of, a, piece, of, wood, quantitatively, the, stress, is, expressed, by, the, cauchy, traction, vector, t, defined, as, the, traction, force, f, between, adjacent, parts, of, the, material, across, an, imaginary, separating, surface, s, divided, by, the, area, of, s, 41, 50, in, a, fluid, at, rest, the, force, is, perpendicular, to, the, surface, and, is, the, familiar, pressure, in, a, solid, or, in, a, flow, of, viscous, liquid, the, force, f, may, not, be, perpendicular, to, s, hence, the, stress, across, a, surface, must, be, regarded, a, vector, quantity, not, a, scalar, moreover, the, direction, and, magnitude, generally, depend, on, the, orientation, of, s, thus, the, stress, state, of, the, material, must, be, described, by, a, tensor, called, the, cauchy, stress, tensor, which, is, a, linear, function, that, relates, the, normal, vector, n, of, a, surface, s, to, the, traction, vector, t, across, s, with, respect, to, any, chosen, coordinate, system, the, cauchy, stress, tensor, can, be, represented, as, a, symmetric, matrix, of, 3, 3, real, numbers, even, within, a, homogeneous, body, the, stress, tensor, may, vary, from, place, to, place, and, may, change, over, time, therefore, the, stress, within, a, material, is, in, general, a, time, varying, tensor, field, in, general, the, stress, t, that, a, particle, p, applies, on, another, particle, q, across, a, surface, s, can, have, any, direction, relative, to, s, the, vector, t, may, be, regarded, as, the, sum, of, two, components, the, normal, stress, compression, or, tension, perpendicular, to, the, surface, and, the, shear, stress, that, is, parallel, to, the, surface, if, the, normal, unit, vector, n, of, the, surface, pointing, from, q, towards, p, is, assumed, fixed, the, normal, component, can, be, expressed, by, a, single, number, the, dot, product, t, n, this, number, will, be, positive, if, p, is, pulling, on, q, tensile, stress, and, negative, if, p, is, pushing, against, q, compressive, stress, the, shear, component, is, then, the, vector, t, t, n, n, the, dimension, of, stress, is, that, of, pressure, and, therefore, its, coordinates, are, measured, in, the, same, units, as, pressure, namely, pascals, pa, that, is, newtons, per, square, metre, in, the, international, system, or, pounds, per, square, inch, psi, in, the, imperial, system, because, mechanical, stresses, easily, exceed, a, million, pascals, mpa, which, stands, for, megapascal, is, a, common, unit, of, stress, stress, in, a, material, body, may, be, due, to, multiple, physical, causes, including, external, influences, and, internal, physical, processes, some, of, these, agents, like, gravity, changes, in, temperature, and, phase, and, electromagnetic, fields, act, on, the, bulk, of, the, material, varying, continuously, with, position, and, time, other, agents, like, external, loads, and, friction, ambient, pressure, and, contact, forces, may, create, stresses, and, forces, that, are, concentrated, on, certain, surfaces, lines, or, points, and, possibly, also, on, very, short, time, intervals, as, in, the, impulses, due, to, collisions, in, active, matter, self, propulsion, of, microscopic, particles, generates, macroscopic, stress, profiles, in, general, the, stress, distribution, in, a, body, is, expressed, as, a, piecewise, continuous, function, of, space, and, time, conversely, stress, is, usually, correlated, with, various, effects, on, the, material, possibly, including, changes, in, physical, properties, like, birefringence, polarization, and, permeability, the, imposition, of, stress, by, an, external, agent, usually, creates, some, strain, deformation, in, the, material, even, if, it, is, too, small, to, be, detected, in, a, solid, material, such, strain, will, in, turn, generate, an, internal, elastic, stress, analogous, to, the, reaction, force, of, a, stretched, spring, tending, to, restore, the, material, to, its, original, undeformed, state, fluid, materials, liquids, gases, and, plasmas, by, definition, can, only, oppose, deformations, that, would, change, their, volume, if, the, deformation, changes, with, time, even, in, fluids, there, will, usually, be, some, viscous, stress, opposing, that, change, such, stresses, can, be, either, shear, or, normal, in, nature, molecular, origin, of, shear, stresses, in, fluids, is, given, in, the, article, on, viscosity, the, same, for, normal, viscous, stresses, can, be, found, in, sharma, 2019, the, relation, between, stress, and, its, effects, and, causes, including, deformation, and, rate, of, change, of, deformation, can, be, quite, complicated, although, a, linear, approximation, may, be, adequate, in, practice, if, the, quantities, are, small, enough, stress, that, exceeds, certain, strength, limits, of, the, material, will, result, in, permanent, deformation, such, as, plastic, flow, fracture, cavitation, or, even, change, its, crystal, structure, and, chemical, composition, in, some, situations, the, stress, within, a, body, may, adequately, be, described, by, a, single, number, or, by, a, single, vector, a, number, and, a, direction, three, such, simple, stress, situations, that, are, often, encountered, in, engineering, design, are, the, uniaxial, normal, stress, the, simple, shear, stress, and, the, isotropic, normal, stress, a, common, situation, with, a, simple, stress, pattern, is, when, a, straight, rod, with, uniform, material, and, cross, section, is, subjected, to, tension, by, opposite, forces, of, magnitude, f, displaystyle, f, along, its, axis, if, the, system, is, in, equilibrium, and, not, changing, with, time, and, the, weight, of, the, bar, can, be, neglected, then, through, each, transversal, section, of, the, bar, the, top, part, must, pull, on, the, bottom, part, with, the, same, force, f, with, continuity, through, the, full, cross, sectional, area, a, therefore, the, stress, throughout, the, bar, across, any, horizontal, surface, can, be, expressed, simply, by, the, single, number, calculated, simply, with, the, magnitude, of, those, forces, f, and, cross, sectional, area, a, f, a, displaystyle, sigma, frac, f, a, on, the, other, hand, if, one, imagines, the, bar, being, cut, along, its, length, parallel, to, the, axis, there, will, be, no, force, hence, no, stress, between, the, two, halves, across, the, cut, this, type, of, stress, may, be, called, simple, normal, stress, or, uniaxial, stress, specifically, uniaxial, simple, etc, tensile, stress, if, the, load, is, compression, on, the, bar, rather, than, stretching, it, the, analysis, is, the, same, except, that, the, force, f, and, the, stress, displaystyle, sigma, change, sign, and, the, stress, is, called, compressive, stress, this, analysis, assumes, the, stress, is, evenly, distributed, over, the, entire, cross, section, in, practice, depending, on, how, the, bar, is, attached, at, the, ends, and, how, it, was, manufactured, this, assumption, may, not, be, valid, in, that, case, the, value, displaystyle, sigma, f, a, will, be, only, the, average, stress, called, engineering, stress, or, nominal, stress, if, the, bar, s, length, l, is, many, times, its, diameter, d, and, it, has, no, gross, defects, or, built, in, stress, then, the, stress, can, be, assumed, to, be, uniformly, distributed, over, any, cross, section, that, is, more, than, a, few, times, d, from, both, ends, this, observation, is, known, as, the, saint, venant, s, principle, normal, stress, occurs, in, many, other, situations, besides, axial, tension, and, compression, if, an, elastic, bar, with, uniform, and, symmetric, cross, section, is, bent, in, one, of, its, planes, of, symmetry, the, resulting, bending, stress, will, still, be, normal, perpendicular, to, the, cross, section, but, will, vary, over, the, cross, section, the, outer, part, will, be, under, tensile, stress, while, the, inner, part, will, be, compressed, another, variant, of, normal, stress, is, the, hoop, stress, that, occurs, on, the, walls, of, a, cylindrical, pipe, or, vessel, filled, with, pressurized, fluid, another, simple, type, of, stress, occurs, when, a, uniformly, thick, layer, of, elastic, material, like, glue, or, rubber, is, firmly, attached, to, two, stiff, bodies, that, are, pulled, in, opposite, directions, by, forces, parallel, to, the, layer, or, a, section, of, a, soft, metal, bar, that, is, being, cut, by, the, jaws, of, a, scissors, like, tool, let, f, be, the, magnitude, of, those, forces, and, m, be, the, midplane, of, that, layer, just, as, in, the, normal, stress, case, the, part, of, the, layer, on, one, side, of, m, must, pull, the, other, part, with, the, same, force, f, assuming, that, the, direction, of, the, forces, is, known, the, stress, across, m, can, be, expressed, simply, by, the, single, number, displaystyle, tau, calculated, simply, with, the, magnitude, of, those, forces, f, and, the, cross, sectional, area, a, f, a, displaystyle, tau, frac, f, a, unlike, normal, stress, this, simple, shear, stress, is, directed, parallel, to, the, cross, section, considered, rather, than, perpendicular, to, it, for, any, plane, s, that, is, perpendicular, to, the, layer, the, net, internal, force, across, s, and, hence, the, stress, will, be, zero, as, in, the, case, of, an, axially, loaded, bar, in, practice, the, shear, stress, may, not, be, uniformly, distributed, over, the, layer, so, as, before, the, ratio, f, a, will, only, be, an, average, nominal, engineering, stress, that, average, is, often, sufficient, for, practical, purposes, 292, shear, stress, is, observed, also, when, a, cylindrical, bar, such, as, a, shaft, is, subjected, to, opposite, torques, at, its, ends, in, that, case, the, shear, stress, on, each, cross, section, is, parallel, to, the, cross, section, but, oriented, tangentially, relative, to, the, axis, and, increases, with, distance, from, the, axis, significant, shear, stress, occurs, in, the, middle, plate, the, web, of, i, beams, under, bending, loads, due, to, the, web, constraining, the, end, plates, flanges, another, simple, type, of, stress, occurs, when, the, material, body, is, under, equal, compression, or, tension, in, all, directions, this, is, the, case, for, example, in, a, portion, of, liquid, or, gas, at, rest, whether, enclosed, in, some, container, or, as, part, of, a, larger, mass, of, fluid, or, inside, a, cube, of, elastic, material, that, is, being, pressed, or, pulled, on, all, six, faces, by, equal, perpendicular, forces, provided, in, both, cases, that, the, material, is, homogeneous, without, built, in, stress, and, that, the, effect, of, gravity, and, other, external, forces, can, be, neglected, in, these, situations, the, stress, across, any, imaginary, internal, surface, turns, out, to, be, equal, in, magnitude, and, always, directed, perpendicularly, to, the, surface, independently, of, the, surface, s, orientation, this, type, of, stress, may, be, called, isotropic, normal, or, just, isotropic, if, it, is, compressive, it, is, called, hydrostatic, pressure, or, just, pressure, gases, by, definition, cannot, withstand, tensile, stresses, but, some, liquids, may, withstand, very, large, amounts, of, isotropic, tensile, stress, under, some, circumstances, see, z, tube, parts, with, rotational, symmetry, such, as, wheels, axles, pipes, and, pillars, are, very, common, in, engineering, often, the, stress, patterns, that, occur, in, such, parts, have, rotational, or, even, cylindrical, symmetry, the, analysis, of, such, cylinder, stresses, can, take, advantage, of, the, symmetry, to, reduce, the, dimension, of, the, domain, and, or, of, the, stress, tensor, often, mechanical, bodies, experience, more, than, one, type, of, stress, at, the, same, time, this, is, called, combined, stress, in, normal, and, shear, stress, the, magnitude, of, the, stress, is, maximum, for, surfaces, that, are, perpendicular, to, a, certain, direction, d, displaystyle, d, and, zero, across, any, surfaces, that, are, parallel, to, d, displaystyle, d, when, the, shear, stress, is, zero, only, across, surfaces, that, are, perpendicular, to, one, particular, direction, the, stress, is, called, biaxial, and, can, be, viewed, as, the, sum, of, two, normal, or, shear, stresses, in, the, most, general, case, called, triaxial, stress, the, stress, is, nonzero, across, every, surface, element, combined, stresses, cannot, be, described, by, a, single, vector, even, if, the, material, is, stressed, in, the, same, way, throughout, the, volume, of, the, body, the, stress, across, any, imaginary, surface, will, depend, on, the, orientation, of, that, surface, in, a, non, trivial, way, cauchy, observed, that, the, stress, vector, t, displaystyle, t, across, a, surface, will, always, be, a, linear, function, of, the, surface, s, normal, vector, n, displaystyle, n, the, unit, length, vector, that, is, perpendicular, to, it, that, is, t, n, displaystyle, t, boldsymbol, sigma, n, where, the, function, displaystyle, boldsymbol, sigma, satisfies, u, v, u, v, displaystyle, boldsymbol, sigma, alpha, u, beta, v, alpha, boldsymbol, sigma, u, beta, boldsymbol, sigma, v, for, any, vectors, u, v, displaystyle, u, v, and, any, real, numbers, displaystyle, alpha, beta, the, function, displaystyle, boldsymbol, sigma, now, called, the, cauchy, stress, tensor, completely, describes, the, stress, state, of, a, uniformly, stressed, body, today, any, linear, connection, between, two, physical, vector, quantities, is, called, a, tensor, reflecting, cauchy, s, original, use, to, describe, the, tensions, stresses, in, a, material, in, tensor, calculus, displaystyle, boldsymbol, sigma, is, classified, as, a, second, order, tensor, of, type, 0, 2, or, 1, 1, depending, on, convention, like, any, linear, map, between, vectors, the, stress, tensor, can, be, represented, in, any, chosen, cartesian, coordinate, system, by, a, 3, 3, matrix, of, real, numbers, depending, on, whether, the, coordinates, are, numbered, x, 1, x, 2, x, 3, displaystyle, x, 1, x, 2, x, 3, or, named, x, y, z, displaystyle, x, y, z, the, matrix, may, be, written, as, 11, 12, 13, 21, 22, 23, 31, 32, 33, displaystyle, begin, bmatrix, sigma, 11, sigma, 12, sigma, 13, sigma, 21, sigma, 22, sigma, 23, sigma, 31, sigma, 32, sigma, 33, end, bmatrix, or, x, x, x, y, x, z, y, x, y, y, y, z, z, x, z, y, z, z, displaystyle, begin, bmatrix, sigma, xx, sigma, xy, sigma, xz, sigma, yx, sigma, yy, sigma, yz, sigma, zx, sigma, zy, sigma, zz, end, bmatrix, the, stress, vector, t, n, displaystyle, t, boldsymbol, sigma, n, across, a, surface, with, normal, vector, n, displaystyle, n, which, is, covariant, row, horizontal, vector, with, coordinates, n, 1, n, 2, n, 3, displaystyle, n, 1, n, 2, n, 3, is, then, a, matrix, product, t, n, displaystyle, t, n, cdot, boldsymbol, sigma, where, t, in, upper, index, is, transposition, and, as, a, result, we, get, covariant, row, vector, look, on, cauchy, stress, tensor, that, is, t, 1, t, 2, t, 3, n, 1, n, 2, n, 3, 11, 21, 31, 12, 22, 32, 13, 23, 33, displaystyle, begin, bmatrix, t, 1, t, 2, t, 3, end, bmatrix, begin, bmatrix, n, 1, n, 2, n, 3, end, bmatrix, cdot, begin, bmatrix, sigma, 11, sigma, 21, sigma, 31, sigma, 12, sigma, 22, sigma, 32, sigma, 13, sigma, 23, sigma, 33, end, bmatrix, the, linear, relation, between, t, displaystyle, t, and, n, displaystyle, n, follows, from, the, fundamental, laws, of, conservation, of, linear, momentum, and, static, equilibrium, of, forces, and, is, therefore, mathematically, exact, for, any, material, and, any, stress, situation, the, components, of, the, cauchy, stress, tensor, at, every, point, in, a, material, satisfy, the, equilibrium, equations, cauchy, s, equations, of, motion, for, zero, acceleration, moreover, the, principle, of, conservation, of, angular, momentum, implies, that, the, stress, tensor, is, symmetric, that, is, 12, 21, displaystyle, sigma, 12, sigma, 21, 13, 31, displaystyle, sigma, 13, sigma, 31, and, 23, 32, displaystyle, sigma, 23, sigma, 32, therefore, the, stress, state, of, the, medium, at, any, point, and, instant, can, be, specified, by, only, six, independent, parameters, rather, than, nine, these, may, be, written, x, x, y, x, z, x, y, y, y, z, x, z, y, z, z, displaystyle, begin, bmatrix, sigma, x, tau, xy, tau, xz, tau, xy, sigma, y, tau, yz, tau, xz, tau, yz, sigma, z, end, bmatrix, where, the, elements, x, y, z, displaystyle, sigma, x, sigma, y, sigma, z, are, called, the, orthogonal, normal, stresses, relative, to, the, chosen, coordinate, system, and, x, y, x, z, y, z, displaystyle, tau, xy, tau, xz, tau, yz, the, orthogonal, shear, stresses, the, cauchy, stress, tensor, obeys, the, tensor, transformation, law, under, a, change, in, the, system, of, coordinates, a, graphical, representation, of, this, transformation, law, is, the, mohr, s, circle, of, stress, distribution, as, a, symmetric, 3, 3, real, matrix, the, stress, tensor, displaystyle, boldsymbol, sigma, has, three, mutually, orthogonal, unit, length, eigenvectors, e, 1, e, 2, e, 3, displaystyle, e, 1, e, 2, e, 3, and, three, real, eigenvalues, 1, 2, 3, displaystyle, lambda, 1, lambda, 2, lambda, 3, such, that, e, i, i, e, i, displaystyle, boldsymbol, sigma, e, i, lambda, i, e, i, therefore, in, a, coordinate, system, with, axes, e, 1, e, 2, e, 3, displaystyle, e, 1, e, 2, e, 3, the, stress, tensor, is, a, diagonal, matrix, and, has, only, the, three, normal, components, 1, 2, 3, displaystyle, lambda, 1, lambda, 2, lambda, 3, the, principal, stresses, if, the, three, eigenvalues, are, equal, the, stress, is, an, isotropic, compression, or, tension, always, perpendicular, to, any, surface, there, is, no, shear, stress, and, the, tensor, is, a, diagonal, matrix, in, any, coordinate, frame, in, general, stress, is, not, uniformly, distributed, over, a, material, body, and, may, vary, with, time, therefore, the, stress, tensor, must, be, defined, for, each, point, and, each, moment, by, considering, an, infinitesimal, particle, of, the, medium, surrounding, that, point, and, taking, the, average, stresses, in, that, particle, as, being, the, stresses, at, the, point, human, made, objects, are, often, made, from, stock, plates, of, various, materials, by, operations, that, do, not, change, their, essentially, two, dimensional, character, like, cutting, drilling, gentle, bending, and, welding, along, the, edges, the, description, of, stress, in, such, bodies, can, be, simplified, by, modeling, those, parts, as, two, dimensional, surfaces, rather, than, three, dimensional, bodies, in, that, view, one, redefines, a, particle, as, being, an, infinitesimal, patch, of, the, plate, s, surface, so, that, the, boundary, between, adjacent, particles, becomes, an, infinitesimal, line, element, both, are, implicitly, extended, in, the, third, dimension, normal, to, straight, through, the, plate, stress, is, then, redefined, as, being, a, measure, of, the, internal, forces, between, two, adjacent, particles, across, their, common, line, element, divided, by, the, length, of, that, line, some, components, of, the, stress, tensor, can, be, ignored, but, since, particles, are, not, infinitesimal, in, the, third, dimension, one, can, no, longer, ignore, the, torque, that, a, particle, applies, on, its, neighbors, that, torque, is, modeled, as, a, bending, stress, that, tends, to, change, the, curvature, of, the, plate, these, simplifications, may, not, hold, at, welds, at, sharp, bends, and, creases, where, the, radius, of, curvature, is, comparable, to, the, thickness, of, the, plate, the, analysis, of, stress, can, be, considerably, simplified, also, for, thin, bars, beams, or, wires, of, uniform, or, smoothly, varying, composition, and, cross, section, that, are, subjected, to, moderate, bending, and, twisting, for, those, bodies, one, may, consider, only, cross, sections, that, are, perpendicular, to, the, bar, s, axis, and, redefine, a, particle, as, being, a, piece, of, wire, with, infinitesimal, length, between, two, such, cross, sections, the, ordinary, stress, is, then, reduced, to, a, scalar, tension, or, compression, of, the, bar, but, one, must, take, into, account, also, a, bending, stress, that, tries, to, change, the, bar, s, curvature, in, some, direction, perpendicular, to, the, axis, and, a, torsional, stress, that, tries, to, twist, or, un, twist, it, about, its, axis, stress, analysis, is, a, branch, of, applied, physics, that, covers, the, determination, of, the, internal, distribution, of, internal, forces, in, solid, objects, it, is, an, essential, tool, in, engineering, for, the, study, and, design, of, structures, such, as, tunnels, dams, mechanical, parts, and, structural, frames, under, prescribed, or, expected, loads, it, is, also, important, in, many, other, disciplines, for, example, in, geology, to, study, phenomena, like, plate, tectonics, vulcanism, and, avalanches, and, in, biology, to, understand, the, anatomy, of, living, beings, stress, analysis, is, generally, concerned, with, objects, and, structures, that, can, be, assumed, to, be, in, macroscopic, static, equilibrium, by, newton, s, laws, of, motion, any, external, forces, being, applied, to, such, a, system, must, be, balanced, by, internal, reaction, forces, 97, which, are, almost, always, surface, contact, forces, between, adjacent, particles, that, is, as, stress, since, every, particle, needs, to, be, in, equilibrium, this, reaction, stress, will, generally, propagate, from, particle, to, particle, creating, a, stress, distribution, throughout, the, body, the, typical, problem, in, stress, analysis, is, to, determine, these, internal, stresses, given, the, external, forces, that, are, acting, on, the, system, the, latter, may, be, body, forces, such, as, gravity, or, magnetic, attraction, that, act, throughout, the, volume, of, a, material, 42, 81, or, concentrated, loads, such, as, friction, between, an, axle, and, a, bearing, or, the, weight, of, a, train, wheel, on, a, rail, that, are, imagined, to, act, over, a, two, dimensional, area, or, along, a, line, or, at, single, point, in, stress, analysis, one, normally, disregards, the, physical, causes, of, the, forces, or, the, precise, nature, of, the, materials, instead, one, assumes, that, the, stresses, are, related, to, deformation, and, in, non, static, problems, to, the, rate, of, deformation, of, the, material, by, known, constitutive, equations, stress, analysis, may, be, carried, out, experimentally, by, applying, loads, to, the, actual, artifact, or, to, scale, model, and, measuring, the, resulting, stresses, by, any, of, several, available, methods, this, approach, is, often, used, for, safety, certification, and, monitoring, most, stress, is, analysed, by, mathematical, methods, especially, during, design, the, basic, stress, analysis, problem, can, be, formulated, by, euler, s, equations, of, motion, for, continuous, bodies, which, are, consequences, of, newton, s, laws, for, conservation, of, linear, momentum, and, angular, momentum, and, the, euler, cauchy, stress, principle, together, with, the, appropriate, constitutive, equations, thus, one, obtains, a, system, of, partial, differential, equations, involving, the, stress, tensor, field, and, the, strain, tensor, field, as, unknown, functions, to, be, determined, the, external, body, forces, appear, as, the, independent, right, hand, side, term, in, the, differential, equations, while, the, concentrated, forces, appear, as, boundary, conditions, the, basic, stress, analysis, problem, is, therefore, a, boundary, value, problem, stress, analysis, for, elastic, structures, is, based, on, the, theory, of, elasticity, and, infinitesimal, strain, theory, when, the, applied, loads, cause, permanent, deformation, one, must, use, more, complicated, constitutive, equations, that, can, account, for, the, physical, processes, involved, plastic, flow, fracture, phase, change, etc, engineered, structures, are, usually, designed, so, the, maximum, expected, stresses, are, well, within, the, range, of, linear, elasticity, the, generalization, of, hooke, s, law, for, continuous, media, that, is, the, deformations, caused, by, internal, stresses, are, linearly, related, to, them, in, this, case, the, differential, equations, that, define, the, stress, tensor, are, linear, and, the, problem, becomes, much, easier, for, one, thing, the, stress, at, any, point, will, be, a, linear, function, of, the, loads, too, for, small, enough, stresses, even, non, linear, systems, can, usually, be, assumed, to, be, linear, stress, analysis, is, simplified, when, the, physical, dimensions, and, the, distribution, of, loads, allow, the, structure, to, be, treated, as, one, or, two, dimensional, in, the, analysis, of, trusses, for, example, the, stress, field, may, be, assumed, to, be, uniform, and, uniaxial, over, each, member, then, the, differential, equations, reduce, to, a, finite, set, of, equations, usually, linear, with, finitely, many, unknowns, in, other, contexts, one, may, be, able, to, reduce, the, three, dimensional, problem, to, a, two, dimensional, one, and, or, replace, the, general, stress, and, strain, tensors, by, simpler, models, like, uniaxial, tension, compression, simple, shear, etc, still, for, two, or, three, dimensional, cases, one, must, solve, a, partial, differential, equation, problem, analytical, or, closed, form, solutions, to, the, differential, equations, can, be, obtained, when, the, geometry, constitutive, relations, and, boundary, conditions, are, simple, enough, otherwise, one, must, generally, resort, to, numerical, approximations, such, as, the, finite, element, method, the, finite, difference, method, and, the, boundary, element, method, other, useful, stress, measures, include, the, first, and, second, piola, kirchhoff, stress, tensors, the, biot, stress, tensor, and, the, kirchhoff, stress, tensor
