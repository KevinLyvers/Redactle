a, monsoon, m, n, s, u, n, is, traditionally, a, seasonal, reversing, wind, accompanied, by, corresponding, changes, in, precipitation, but, is, now, used, to, describe, seasonal, changes, in, atmospheric, circulation, and, precipitation, associated, with, annual, latitudinal, oscillation, of, the, intertropical, convergence, zone, itcz, between, its, limits, to, the, north, and, south, of, the, equator, usually, the, term, monsoon, is, used, to, refer, to, the, rainy, phase, of, a, seasonally, changing, pattern, although, technically, there, is, also, a, dry, phase, the, term, is, also, sometimes, used, to, describe, locally, heavy, but, short, term, rains, the, major, monsoon, systems, of, the, world, consist, of, the, west, african, asian, australian, the, north, american, and, south, american, monsoons, the, term, was, first, used, in, english, in, british, india, and, neighboring, countries, to, refer, to, the, big, seasonal, winds, blowing, from, the, bay, of, bengal, and, arabian, sea, in, the, southwest, bringing, heavy, rainfall, to, the, area, the, etymology, of, the, word, monsoon, is, not, wholly, certain, the, english, monsoon, came, from, portuguese, mon, o, ultimately, from, arabic, mawsim, season, perhaps, partly, via, early, modern, dutch, monson, strengthening, of, the, asian, monsoon, has, been, linked, to, the, uplift, of, the, tibetan, plateau, after, the, collision, of, the, indian, subcontinent, and, asia, around, 50, million, years, ago, because, of, studies, of, records, from, the, arabian, sea, and, that, of, the, wind, blown, dust, in, the, loess, plateau, of, china, many, geologists, believe, the, monsoon, first, became, strong, around, 8, million, years, ago, more, recently, studies, of, plant, fossils, in, china, and, new, long, duration, sediment, records, from, the, south, china, sea, led, to, a, timing, of, the, monsoon, beginning, 15, 20, million, years, ago, and, linked, to, early, tibetan, uplift, testing, of, this, hypothesis, awaits, deep, ocean, sampling, by, the, integrated, ocean, drilling, program, the, monsoon, has, varied, significantly, in, strength, since, this, time, largely, linked, to, global, climate, change, especially, the, cycle, of, the, pleistocene, ice, ages, a, study, of, asian, monsoonal, climate, cycles, from, 123, 200, to, 121, 210, years, bp, during, the, eemian, interglacial, suggests, that, they, had, an, average, duration, of, around, 64, years, with, the, minimum, duration, being, around, 50, years, and, the, maximum, approximately, 80, years, similar, to, today, a, study, of, marine, plankton, suggested, that, the, south, asian, monsoon, sam, strengthened, around, 5, million, years, ago, then, during, ice, periods, the, sea, level, fell, and, the, indonesian, seaway, closed, when, this, happened, cold, waters, in, the, pacific, were, impeded, from, flowing, into, the, indian, ocean, it, is, believed, that, the, resulting, increase, in, sea, surface, temperatures, in, the, indian, ocean, increased, the, intensity, of, monsoons, in, 2018, a, study, of, the, sam, s, variability, over, the, past, million, years, found, that, precipitation, resulting, from, the, monsoon, was, significantly, reduced, during, glacial, periods, compared, to, interglacial, periods, like, the, present, day, the, indian, summer, monsoon, ism, underwent, several, intensifications, during, the, warming, following, the, last, glacial, maximum, specifically, during, the, time, intervals, corresponding, to, 16, 100, 14, 600, bp, 13, 600, 13, 000, bp, and, 12, 400, 10, 400, bp, as, indicated, by, vegetation, changes, in, the, tibetan, plateau, displaying, increases, in, humidity, brought, by, an, intensifying, ism, though, the, ism, was, relatively, weak, for, much, of, the, late, holocene, significant, glacial, accumulation, in, the, himalayas, still, occurred, due, to, cold, temperatures, brought, by, westerlies, from, the, west, during, the, middle, miocene, the, july, itcz, the, zone, of, rainfall, maximum, migrated, northwards, increasing, precipitation, over, southern, china, during, the, east, asian, summer, monsoon, easm, while, making, indochina, drier, during, the, late, miocene, global, cooling, lmcg, from, 7, 9, to, 5, 8, million, years, ago, the, east, asian, winter, monsoon, eawm, became, stronger, as, the, subarctic, front, shifted, southwards, an, abrupt, intensification, of, the, eawm, occurred, 5, 5, million, years, ago, the, eawm, was, still, significantly, weaker, relative, to, today, between, 4, 3, and, 3, 8, million, years, ago, but, abruptly, became, more, intense, around, 3, 8, million, years, ago, as, crustal, stretching, widened, the, tsushima, strait, and, enabled, greater, inflow, of, the, warm, tsushima, current, into, the, sea, of, japan, circa, 3, 0, million, years, ago, the, eawm, became, more, stable, having, previously, been, more, variable, and, inconsistent, in, addition, to, being, enhanced, further, amidst, a, period, of, global, cooling, and, sea, level, fall, the, easm, was, weaker, during, cold, intervals, of, glacial, periods, such, as, the, last, glacial, maximum, lgm, and, stronger, during, interglacials, and, warm, intervals, of, glacial, periods, another, eawm, intensification, event, occurred, 2, 6, million, years, ago, followed, by, yet, another, one, around, 1, 0, million, years, ago, during, dansgaard, oeschger, events, the, easm, grew, in, strength, but, it, has, been, suggested, to, have, decreased, in, strength, during, heinrich, events, the, easm, expanded, its, influence, deeper, into, the, interior, of, asia, as, sea, levels, rose, following, the, lgm, it, also, underwent, a, period, of, intensification, during, the, middle, holocene, around, 6, 000, years, ago, due, to, orbital, forcing, made, more, intense, by, the, fact, that, the, sahara, at, the, time, was, much, more, vegetated, and, emitted, less, dust, this, middle, holocene, interval, of, maximum, easm, was, associated, with, an, expansion, of, temperate, deciduous, forest, steppe, and, temperate, mixed, forest, steppe, in, northern, china, by, around, 5, 000, to, 4, 500, bp, the, east, asian, monsoon, s, strength, began, to, wane, weakening, from, that, point, until, the, present, day, a, particularly, notable, weakening, took, place, 3, 000, bp, the, location, of, the, easm, shifted, multiple, times, over, the, course, of, the, holocene, first, it, moved, southward, between, 12, 000, and, 8, 000, bp, followed, by, an, expansion, to, the, north, between, approximately, 8, 000, and, 4, 000, bp, and, most, recently, retreated, southward, once, more, between, 4, 000, and, 0, bp, the, january, itcz, migrated, further, south, to, its, present, location, during, the, middle, miocene, strengthening, the, summer, monsoon, of, australia, that, had, previously, been, weaker, five, episodes, during, the, quaternary, at, 2, 22, ma, pl, 1, 1, 83, ma, pl, 2, 0, 68, ma, pl, 3, 0, 45, ma, pl, 4, and, 0, 04, ma, pl, 5, were, identified, which, showed, a, weakening, of, the, leeuwin, current, lc, the, weakening, of, the, lc, would, have, an, effect, on, the, sea, surface, temperature, sst, field, in, the, indian, ocean, as, the, indonesian, throughflow, generally, warms, the, indian, ocean, thus, these, five, intervals, could, probably, be, those, of, considerable, lowering, of, sst, in, the, indian, ocean, and, would, have, influenced, indian, monsoon, intensity, during, the, weak, lc, there, is, the, possibility, of, reduced, intensity, of, the, indian, winter, monsoon, and, strong, summer, monsoon, because, of, change, in, the, indian, ocean, dipole, due, to, reduction, in, net, heat, input, to, the, indian, ocean, through, the, indonesian, throughflow, thus, a, better, understanding, of, the, possible, links, between, el, ni, o, western, pacific, warm, pool, indonesian, throughflow, wind, pattern, off, western, australia, and, ice, volume, expansion, and, contraction, can, be, obtained, by, studying, the, behaviour, of, the, lc, during, quaternary, at, close, stratigraphic, intervals, the, south, american, summer, monsoon, sasm, is, known, to, have, become, weakened, during, dansgaard, oeschger, events, the, sasm, has, been, suggested, to, have, been, enhanced, during, heinrich, events, monsoons, were, once, considered, as, a, large, scale, sea, breeze, caused, by, higher, temperature, over, land, than, in, the, ocean, this, is, no, longer, considered, as, the, cause, and, the, monsoon, is, now, considered, a, planetary, scale, phenomenon, involving, the, annual, migration, of, the, intertropical, convergence, zone, between, its, northern, and, southern, limits, the, limits, of, the, itcz, vary, according, to, the, land, sea, heating, contrast, and, it, is, thought, that, the, northern, extent, of, the, monsoon, in, south, asia, is, influenced, by, the, high, tibetan, plateau, these, temperature, imbalances, happen, because, oceans, and, land, absorb, heat, in, different, ways, over, oceans, the, air, temperature, remains, relatively, stable, for, two, reasons, water, has, a, relatively, high, heat, capacity, 3, 9, to, 4, 2, j, g, 1, k, 1, and, because, both, conduction, and, convection, will, equilibrate, a, hot, or, cold, surface, with, deeper, water, up, to, 50, metres, in, contrast, dirt, sand, and, rocks, have, lower, heat, capacities, 0, 19, to, 0, 35, j, g, 1, k, 1, and, they, can, only, transmit, heat, into, the, earth, by, conduction, and, not, by, convection, therefore, bodies, of, water, stay, at, a, more, even, temperature, while, land, temperatures, are, more, variable, during, warmer, months, sunlight, heats, the, surfaces, of, both, land, and, oceans, but, land, temperatures, rise, more, quickly, as, the, land, s, surface, becomes, warmer, the, air, above, it, expands, and, an, area, of, low, pressure, develops, meanwhile, the, ocean, remains, at, a, lower, temperature, than, the, land, and, the, air, above, it, retains, a, higher, pressure, this, difference, in, pressure, causes, sea, breezes, to, blow, from, the, ocean, to, the, land, bringing, moist, air, inland, this, moist, air, rises, to, a, higher, altitude, over, land, and, then, it, flows, back, toward, the, ocean, thus, completing, the, cycle, however, when, the, air, rises, and, while, it, is, still, over, the, land, the, air, cools, this, decreases, the, air, s, ability, to, hold, water, and, this, causes, precipitation, over, the, land, this, is, why, summer, monsoons, cause, so, much, rain, over, land, in, the, colder, months, the, cycle, is, reversed, then, the, land, cools, faster, than, the, oceans, and, the, air, over, the, land, has, higher, pressure, than, air, over, the, ocean, this, causes, the, air, over, the, land, to, flow, to, the, ocean, when, humid, air, rises, over, the, ocean, it, cools, and, this, causes, precipitation, over, the, oceans, the, cool, air, then, flows, towards, the, land, to, complete, the, cycle, most, summer, monsoons, have, a, dominant, westerly, component, and, a, strong, tendency, to, ascend, and, produce, copious, amounts, of, rain, because, of, the, condensation, of, water, vapor, in, the, rising, air, the, intensity, and, duration, however, are, not, uniform, from, year, to, year, winter, monsoons, by, contrast, have, a, dominant, easterly, component, and, a, strong, tendency, to, diverge, subside, and, cause, drought, similar, rainfall, is, caused, when, moist, ocean, air, is, lifted, upwards, by, mountains, surface, heating, convergence, at, the, surface, divergence, aloft, or, from, storm, produced, outflows, at, the, surface, however, the, lifting, occurs, the, air, cools, due, to, expansion, in, lower, pressure, and, this, produces, condensation, the, monsoon, of, western, sub, saharan, africa, is, the, result, of, the, seasonal, shifts, of, the, intertropical, convergence, zone, and, the, great, seasonal, temperature, and, humidity, differences, between, the, sahara, and, the, equatorial, atlantic, ocean, the, itcz, migrates, northward, from, the, equatorial, atlantic, in, february, reaches, western, africa, on, or, near, june, 22, then, moves, back, to, the, south, by, october, the, dry, northeasterly, trade, winds, and, their, more, extreme, form, the, harmattan, are, interrupted, by, the, northern, shift, in, the, itcz, and, resultant, southerly, rain, bearing, winds, during, the, summer, the, semiarid, sahel, and, sudan, depend, upon, this, pattern, for, most, of, their, precipitation, the, north, american, monsoon, nam, occurs, from, late, june, or, early, july, into, september, originating, over, mexico, and, spreading, into, the, southwest, united, states, by, mid, july, it, affects, mexico, along, the, sierra, madre, occidental, as, well, as, arizona, new, mexico, nevada, utah, colorado, west, texas, and, california, it, pushes, as, far, west, as, the, peninsular, ranges, and, transverse, ranges, of, southern, california, but, rarely, reaches, the, coastal, strip, a, wall, of, desert, thunderstorms, only, a, half, hour, s, drive, away, is, a, common, summer, sight, from, the, sunny, skies, along, the, coast, during, the, monsoon, the, north, american, monsoon, is, known, to, many, as, the, summer, southwest, mexican, or, arizona, monsoon, it, is, also, sometimes, called, the, desert, monsoon, as, a, large, part, of, the, affected, area, are, the, mojave, and, sonoran, deserts, however, it, is, controversial, whether, the, north, and, south, american, weather, patterns, with, incomplete, wind, reversal, should, be, counted, as, true, monsoons, the, asian, monsoons, may, be, classified, into, a, few, sub, systems, such, as, the, indian, subcontinental, monsoon, which, affects, the, indian, subcontinent, and, surrounding, regions, including, nepal, and, the, east, asian, monsoon, which, affects, southern, china, taiwan, korea, and, parts, of, japan, the, southwestern, summer, monsoons, occur, from, june, through, september, the, thar, desert, and, adjoining, areas, of, the, northern, and, central, indian, subcontinent, heat, up, considerably, during, the, hot, summers, this, causes, a, low, pressure, area, over, the, northern, and, central, indian, subcontinent, to, fill, this, void, the, moisture, laden, winds, from, the, indian, ocean, rush, into, the, subcontinent, these, winds, rich, in, moisture, are, drawn, towards, the, himalayas, the, himalayas, act, like, a, high, wall, blocking, the, winds, from, passing, into, central, asia, and, forcing, them, to, rise, as, the, clouds, rise, their, temperature, drops, and, precipitation, occurs, some, areas, of, the, subcontinent, receive, up, to, 10, 000, mm, 390, in, of, rain, annually, the, southwest, monsoon, is, generally, expected, to, begin, around, the, beginning, of, june, and, fade, away, by, the, end, of, september, the, moisture, laden, winds, on, reaching, the, southernmost, point, of, the, indian, peninsula, due, to, its, topography, become, divided, into, two, parts, the, arabian, sea, branch, and, the, bay, of, bengal, branch, the, arabian, sea, branch, of, the, southwest, monsoon, first, hits, the, western, ghats, of, the, coastal, state, of, kerala, india, thus, making, this, area, the, first, state, in, india, to, receive, rain, from, the, southwest, monsoon, this, branch, of, the, monsoon, moves, northwards, along, the, western, ghats, konkan, and, goa, with, precipitation, on, coastal, areas, west, of, the, western, ghats, the, eastern, areas, of, the, western, ghats, do, not, receive, much, rain, from, this, monsoon, as, the, wind, does, not, cross, the, western, ghats, the, bay, of, bengal, branch, of, southwest, monsoon, flows, over, the, bay, of, bengal, heading, towards, north, east, india, and, bengal, picking, up, more, moisture, from, the, bay, of, bengal, the, winds, arrive, at, the, eastern, himalayas, with, large, amounts, of, rain, mawsynram, situated, on, the, southern, slopes, of, the, khasi, hills, in, meghalaya, india, is, one, of, the, wettest, places, on, earth, after, the, arrival, at, the, eastern, himalayas, the, winds, turns, towards, the, west, travelling, over, the, indo, gangetic, plain, at, a, rate, of, roughly, 1, 2, weeks, per, state, pouring, rain, all, along, its, way, june, 1, is, regarded, as, the, date, of, onset, of, the, monsoon, in, india, as, indicated, by, the, arrival, of, the, monsoon, in, the, southernmost, state, of, kerala, the, monsoon, accounts, for, nearly, 80, of, the, rainfall, in, india, indian, agriculture, which, accounts, for, 25, of, the, gdp, and, employs, 70, of, the, population, is, heavily, dependent, on, the, rains, for, growing, crops, especially, like, cotton, rice, oilseeds, and, coarse, grains, a, delay, of, a, few, days, in, the, arrival, of, the, monsoon, can, badly, affect, the, economy, as, evidenced, in, the, numerous, droughts, in, india, in, the, 1990s, the, monsoon, is, widely, welcomed, and, appreciated, by, city, dwellers, as, well, for, it, provides, relief, from, the, climax, of, summer, heat, in, june, however, the, roads, take, a, battering, every, year, often, houses, and, streets, are, waterlogged, and, slums, are, flooded, despite, drainage, systems, a, lack, of, city, infrastructure, coupled, with, changing, climate, patterns, causes, severe, economic, loss, including, damage, to, property, and, loss, of, lives, as, evidenced, in, the, 2005, flooding, in, mumbai, that, brought, the, city, to, a, standstill, bangladesh, and, certain, regions, of, india, like, assam, and, west, bengal, also, frequently, experience, heavy, floods, during, this, season, recently, areas, in, india, that, used, to, receive, scanty, rainfall, throughout, the, year, like, the, thar, desert, have, surprisingly, ended, up, receiving, floods, due, to, the, prolonged, monsoon, season, the, influence, of, the, southwest, monsoon, is, felt, as, far, north, as, in, china, s, xinjiang, it, is, estimated, that, about, 70, of, all, precipitation, in, the, central, part, of, the, tian, shan, mountains, falls, during, the, three, summer, months, when, the, region, is, under, the, monsoon, influence, about, 70, of, that, is, directly, of, cyclonic, i, e, monsoon, driven, origin, as, opposed, to, local, convection, the, effects, also, extend, westwards, to, the, mediterranean, where, however, the, impact, of, the, monsoon, is, to, induce, drought, via, the, rodwell, hoskins, mechanism, around, september, with, the, sun, retreating, south, the, northern, landmass, of, the, indian, subcontinent, begins, to, cool, off, rapidly, and, air, pressure, begins, to, build, over, northern, india, the, indian, ocean, and, its, surrounding, atmosphere, still, hold, their, heat, causing, cold, wind, to, sweep, down, from, the, himalayas, and, indo, gangetic, plain, towards, the, vast, spans, of, the, indian, ocean, south, of, the, deccan, peninsula, this, is, known, as, the, northeast, monsoon, or, retreating, monsoon, while, travelling, towards, the, indian, ocean, the, cold, dry, wind, picks, up, some, moisture, from, the, bay, of, bengal, and, pours, it, over, peninsular, india, and, parts, of, sri, lanka, cities, like, chennai, which, get, less, rain, from, the, southwest, monsoon, receive, rain, from, this, monsoon, about, 50, to, 60, of, the, rain, received, by, the, state, of, tamil, nadu, is, from, the, northeast, monsoon, in, southern, asia, the, northeastern, monsoons, take, place, from, october, to, december, when, the, surface, high, pressure, system, is, strongest, the, jet, stream, in, this, region, splits, into, the, southern, subtropical, jet, and, the, polar, jet, the, subtropical, flow, directs, northeasterly, winds, to, blow, across, southern, asia, creating, dry, air, streams, which, produce, clear, skies, over, india, meanwhile, a, low, pressure, system, known, as, a, monsoon, trough, develops, over, south, east, asia, and, australasia, and, winds, are, directed, toward, australia, in, the, philippines, northeast, monsoon, is, called, amihan, the, east, asian, monsoon, affects, large, parts, of, indochina, the, philippines, china, taiwan, korea, japan, and, siberia, it, is, characterised, by, a, warm, rainy, summer, monsoon, and, a, cold, dry, winter, monsoon, the, rain, occurs, in, a, concentrated, belt, that, stretches, east, west, except, in, east, china, where, it, is, tilted, east, northeast, over, korea, and, japan, the, seasonal, rain, is, known, as, meiyu, in, china, jangma, in, korea, and, bai, u, in, japan, with, the, latter, two, resembling, frontal, rain, the, onset, of, the, summer, monsoon, is, marked, by, a, period, of, premonsoonal, rain, over, south, china, and, taiwan, in, early, may, from, may, through, august, the, summer, monsoon, shifts, through, a, series, of, dry, and, rainy, phases, as, the, rain, belt, moves, northward, beginning, over, indochina, and, the, south, china, sea, may, to, the, yangtze, river, basin, and, japan, june, and, finally, to, northern, china, and, korea, july, when, the, monsoon, ends, in, august, the, rain, belt, moves, back, to, southern, china, the, rainy, season, occurs, from, september, to, february, and, it, is, a, major, source, of, energy, for, the, hadley, circulation, during, boreal, winter, it, is, associated, with, the, development, of, the, siberian, high, and, the, movement, of, the, heating, maxima, from, the, northern, hemisphere, to, the, southern, hemisphere, north, easterly, winds, flow, down, southeast, asia, are, turned, north, westerly, westerly, by, borneo, topography, towards, australia, this, forms, a, cyclonic, circulation, vortex, over, borneo, which, together, with, descending, cold, surges, of, winter, air, from, higher, latitudes, cause, significant, weather, phenomena, in, the, region, examples, are, the, formation, of, a, rare, low, latitude, tropical, storm, in, 2001, tropical, storm, vamei, and, the, devastating, flood, of, jakarta, in, 2007, the, onset, of, the, monsoon, over, australia, tends, to, follow, the, heating, maxima, down, vietnam, and, the, malay, peninsula, september, to, sumatra, borneo, and, the, philippines, october, to, java, sulawesi, november, irian, jaya, and, northern, australia, december, january, however, the, monsoon, is, not, a, simple, response, to, heating, but, a, more, complex, interaction, of, topography, wind, and, sea, as, demonstrated, by, its, abrupt, rather, than, gradual, withdrawal, from, the, region, the, australian, monsoon, the, wet, occurs, in, the, southern, summer, when, the, monsoon, trough, develops, over, northern, australia, over, three, quarters, of, annual, rainfall, in, northern, australia, falls, during, this, time, the, european, monsoon, more, commonly, known, as, the, return, of, the, westerlies, is, the, result, of, a, resurgence, of, westerly, winds, from, the, atlantic, where, they, become, loaded, with, wind, and, rain, these, westerly, winds, are, a, common, phenomenon, during, the, european, winter, but, they, ease, as, spring, approaches, in, late, march, and, through, april, and, may, the, winds, pick, up, again, in, june, which, is, why, this, phenomenon, is, also, referred, to, as, the, return, of, the, westerlies, the, rain, usually, arrives, in, two, waves, at, the, beginning, of, june, and, again, in, mid, to, late, june, the, european, monsoon, is, not, a, monsoon, in, the, traditional, sense, in, that, it, doesn, t, meet, all, the, requirements, to, be, classified, as, such, instead, the, return, of, the, westerlies, is, more, regarded, as, a, conveyor, belt, that, delivers, a, series, of, low, pressure, centres, to, western, europe, where, they, create, unsettled, weather, these, storms, generally, feature, significantly, lower, than, average, temperatures, fierce, rain, or, hail, thunder, and, strong, winds, the, return, of, the, westerlies, affects, europe, s, northern, atlantic, coastline, more, precisely, ireland, great, britain, the, benelux, countries, western, germany, northern, france, and, parts, of, scandinavia
