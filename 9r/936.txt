capacitance, is, the, capacity, of, a, material, object, or, device, to, store, electric, charge, it, is, measured, by, the, charge, in, response, to, a, difference, in, electric, potential, expressed, as, the, ratio, of, those, quantities, commonly, recognized, are, two, closely, related, notions, of, capacitance, self, capacitance, and, mutual, capacitance, 237, 238, an, object, that, can, be, electrically, charged, exhibits, self, capacitance, for, which, the, electric, potential, is, measured, between, the, object, and, ground, mutual, capacitance, is, measured, between, two, components, and, is, particularly, important, in, the, operation, of, the, capacitor, an, elementary, linear, electronic, component, designed, to, add, capacitance, to, an, electric, circuit, the, capacitance, between, two, conductors, depends, only, on, the, geometry, the, opposing, surface, area, of, the, conductors, and, the, distance, between, them, and, the, permittivity, of, any, dielectric, material, between, them, for, many, dielectric, materials, the, permittivity, and, thus, the, capacitance, is, independent, of, the, potential, difference, between, the, conductors, and, the, total, charge, on, them, the, si, unit, of, capacitance, is, the, farad, symbol, f, named, after, the, english, physicist, michael, faraday, a, 1, farad, capacitor, when, charged, with, 1, coulomb, of, electrical, charge, has, a, potential, difference, of, 1, volt, between, its, plates, the, reciprocal, of, capacitance, is, called, elastance, in, discussing, electrical, circuits, the, term, capacitance, is, usually, a, shorthand, for, the, mutual, capacitance, between, two, adjacent, conductors, such, as, the, two, plates, of, a, capacitor, however, every, isolated, conductor, also, exhibits, capacitance, here, called, self, capacitance, it, is, measured, by, the, amount, of, electric, charge, that, must, be, added, to, an, isolated, conductor, to, raise, its, electric, potential, by, one, unit, of, measurement, e, g, one, volt, the, reference, point, for, this, potential, is, a, theoretical, hollow, conducting, sphere, of, infinite, radius, with, the, conductor, centered, inside, this, sphere, self, capacitance, of, a, conductor, is, defined, by, the, ratio, of, charge, and, electric, potential, c, q, v, displaystyle, c, frac, q, v, where, using, this, method, the, self, capacitance, of, a, conducting, sphere, of, radius, r, textstyle, r, in, free, space, i, e, far, away, from, any, other, charge, distributions, is, c, 4, 0, r, displaystyle, c, 4, pi, varepsilon, 0, r, example, values, of, self, capacitance, are, the, inter, winding, capacitance, of, a, coil, is, sometimes, called, self, capacitance, but, this, is, a, different, phenomenon, it, is, actually, mutual, capacitance, between, the, individual, turns, of, the, coil, and, is, a, form, of, stray, or, parasitic, capacitance, this, self, capacitance, is, an, important, consideration, at, high, frequencies, it, changes, the, impedance, of, the, coil, and, gives, rise, to, parallel, resonance, in, many, applications, this, is, an, undesirable, effect, and, sets, an, upper, frequency, limit, for, the, correct, operation, of, the, circuit, a, common, form, is, a, parallel, plate, capacitor, which, consists, of, two, conductive, plates, insulated, from, each, other, usually, sandwiching, a, dielectric, material, in, a, parallel, plate, capacitor, capacitance, is, very, nearly, proportional, to, the, surface, area, of, the, conductor, plates, and, inversely, proportional, to, the, separation, distance, between, the, plates, if, the, charges, on, the, plates, are, q, textstyle, q, and, q, textstyle, q, and, v, textstyle, v, gives, the, voltage, between, the, plates, then, the, capacitance, c, textstyle, c, is, given, by, c, q, v, displaystyle, c, frac, q, v, which, gives, the, voltage, current, relationship, i, t, c, d, v, t, d, t, v, d, c, d, t, displaystyle, i, t, c, frac, dv, t, dt, v, frac, dc, dt, where, d, v, t, d, t, textstyle, frac, dv, t, dt, is, the, instantaneous, rate, of, change, of, voltage, and, d, c, d, t, textstyle, frac, dc, dt, is, the, instantaneous, rate, of, change, of, the, capacitance, for, most, applications, the, change, in, capacitance, over, time, is, negligible, so, the, formula, reduces, to, i, t, c, d, v, t, d, t, displaystyle, i, t, c, frac, dv, t, dt, the, energy, stored, in, a, capacitor, is, found, by, integrating, the, work, w, textstyle, w, w, charging, 1, 2, c, v, 2, displaystyle, w, text, charging, frac, 1, 2, cv, 2, the, discussion, above, is, limited, to, the, case, of, two, conducting, plates, although, of, arbitrary, size, and, shape, the, definition, c, q, v, displaystyle, c, q, v, does, not, apply, when, there, are, more, than, two, charged, plates, or, when, the, net, charge, on, the, two, plates, is, non, zero, to, handle, this, case, james, clerk, maxwell, introduced, his, coefficients, of, potential, if, three, nearly, ideal, conductors, are, given, charges, q, 1, q, 2, q, 3, displaystyle, q, 1, q, 2, q, 3, then, the, voltage, at, conductor, 1, is, given, by, v, 1, p, 11, q, 1, p, 12, q, 2, p, 13, q, 3, displaystyle, v, 1, p, 11, q, 1, p, 12, q, 2, p, 13, q, 3, and, similarly, for, the, other, voltages, hermann, von, helmholtz, and, sir, william, thomson, showed, that, the, coefficients, of, potential, are, symmetric, so, that, p, 12, p, 21, displaystyle, p, 12, p, 21, etc, thus, the, system, can, be, described, by, a, collection, of, coefficients, known, as, the, elastance, matrix, or, reciprocal, capacitance, matrix, which, is, defined, as, p, i, j, v, i, q, j, displaystyle, p, ij, frac, partial, v, i, partial, q, j, from, this, the, mutual, capacitance, c, m, displaystyle, c, m, between, two, objects, can, be, defined, by, solving, for, the, total, charge, q, textstyle, q, and, using, c, m, q, v, displaystyle, c, m, q, v, c, m, 1, p, 11, p, 22, p, 12, p, 21, displaystyle, c, m, frac, 1, p, 11, p, 22, p, 12, p, 21, since, no, actual, device, holds, perfectly, equal, and, opposite, charges, on, each, of, the, two, plates, it, is, the, mutual, capacitance, that, is, reported, on, capacitors, the, collection, of, coefficients, c, i, j, q, i, v, j, displaystyle, c, ij, frac, partial, q, i, partial, v, j, is, known, as, the, capacitance, matrix, and, is, the, inverse, of, the, elastance, matrix, the, capacitance, of, the, majority, of, capacitors, used, in, electronic, circuits, is, generally, several, orders, of, magnitude, smaller, than, the, farad, the, most, common, units, of, capacitance, are, the, microfarad, f, nanofarad, nf, picofarad, pf, and, in, microcircuits, femtofarad, ff, some, applications, also, use, supercapacitors, that, can, be, much, larger, as, much, as, hundreds, of, farads, and, parasitic, capacitive, elements, can, be, less, than, a, femtofarad, historical, texts, use, other, obsolete, submultiples, of, the, farad, such, as, mf, and, mfd, for, microfarad, f, mmf, mmfd, pfd, f, for, picofarad, pf, the, capacitance, can, be, calculated, if, the, geometry, of, the, conductors, and, the, dielectric, properties, of, the, insulator, between, the, conductors, are, known, capacitance, is, proportional, to, the, area, of, overlap, and, inversely, proportional, to, the, separation, between, conducting, sheets, the, closer, the, sheets, are, to, each, other, the, greater, the, capacitance, an, example, is, the, capacitance, of, a, capacitor, constructed, of, two, parallel, plates, both, of, area, a, textstyle, a, separated, by, a, distance, d, textstyle, d, if, d, textstyle, d, is, sufficiently, small, with, respect, to, the, smallest, chord, of, a, textstyle,

approximation, if, d, is, small, compared, to, the, other, dimensions, of, the, plates, so, that, the, electric, field, in, the, capacitor, area, is, uniform, and, the, so, called, fringing, field, around, the, periphery, provides, only, a, small, contribution, to, the, capacitance, combining, the, equation, for, capacitance, with, the, above, equation, for, the, energy, stored, in, a,

2, where, w, textstyle, w, is, the, energy, in, joules, c, textstyle, c, is, the, capacitance, in, farads, and, v, textstyle, v, is, the, voltage, in, volts, any, two, adjacent, conductors, can, function, as, a, capacitor, though, the, capacitance, is, small, unless, the, conductors, are, close, together, for, long, distances, or, over, a, large, area, this, often, unwanted, capacitance, is, called, parasitic, or, stray, capacitance, stray, capacitance, can, allow, signals, to, leak, between, otherwise, isolated, circuits, an, effect, called, crosstalk, and, it, can, be, a, limiting, factor, for, proper, functioning, of, circuits, at, high, frequency, stray, capacitance, between, the, input, and, output, in, amplifier, circuits, can, be, troublesome, because, it, can, form, a, path, for, feedback, which, can, cause, instability, and, parasitic, oscillation, in, the, amplifier, it, is, often, convenient, for, analytical, purposes, to, replace, this, capacitance, with, a, combination, of, one, input, to, ground, capacitance, and, one, output, to, ground, capacitance, the, original, configuration, including, the, input, to, output, capacitance, is, often, referred, to, as, a, pi, configuration, miller, s, theorem, can, be, used, to, effect, this, replacement, it, states, that, if, the, gain, ratio, of, two, nodes, is, 1, k, then, an, impedance, of, z, connecting, the, two, nodes, can, be, replaced, with, a, z, 1, k, impedance, between, the, first, node, and, ground, and, a, kz, k, 1, impedance, between, the, second, node, and, ground, since, impedance, varies, inversely, with, capacitance, the, internode, capacitance, c, is, replaced, by, a, capacitance, of, kc, from, input, to, ground, and, a, capacitance, of, k, 1, c, k, from, output, to, ground, when, the, input, to, output, gain, is, very, large, the, equivalent, input, to, ground, impedance, is, very, small, while, the, output, to, ground, impedance, is, essentially, equal, to, the, original, input, to, output, impedance, calculating, the, capacitance, of, a, system, amounts, to, solving, the, laplace, equation, 2, 0, textstyle, nabla, 2, varphi, 0, with, a, constant, potential, textstyle, varphi, on, the, 2, dimensional, surface, of, the, conductors, embedded, in, 3, space, this, is, simplified, by, symmetries, there, is, no, solution, in, terms, of, elementary, functions, in, more, complicated, cases, for, plane, situations, analytic, functions, may, be, used, to, map, different, geometries, to, each, other, see, also, schwarz, christoffel, mapping, see, also, basic, hypergeometric, series, the, energy, measured, in, joules, stored, in, a, capacitor, is, equal, to, the, work, required, to, push, the, charges, into, the, capacitor, i, e, to, charge, it, consider,

coulombs, and, c, is, the, capacitance, measured, in, farads, the, energy, stored, in, a, capacitor, is, found, by, integrating, this, equation, starting, with, an, uncharged, capacitance, q, 0, and, moving, charge, from, one, plate, to, the, other, until, the, plates, have, charge, q, and, q, requires, the, work, w, w, charging, 0, q, q, c, d, q, 1, 2, q, 2, c, 1, 2, q, v, 1, 2, c, v, 2, w,

dielectric, capacitors, such, as, quantum, dots, may, differ, from, conventional, formulations, of, larger, capacitors, in, particular, the, electrostatic, potential, difference, experienced, by, electrons, in, conventional, capacitors, is, spatially, well, defined, and, fixed, by, the, shape, and, size, of, metallic, electrodes, in, addition, to, the, statistically, large, number, of, electrons, present, in, conventional, capacitors, in, nanoscale, capacitors, however, the, electrostatic, potentials, experienced, by, electrons, are, determined, by, the, number, and, locations, of, all, electrons, that, contribute, to, the, electronic, properties, of, the, device, in, such, devices, the, number, of, electrons, may, be, very, small, so, the, resulting, spatial, distribution, of, equipotential, surfaces, within, the, device, is, exceedingly, complex, the, capacitance, of, a, connected, or, closed, single, electron, device, is, twice, the, capacitance, of, an, unconnected, or, open, single, electron, device, this, fact, may, be, traced, more, fundamentally, to, the, energy, stored, in, the, single, electron, device, whose, direct, polarization, interaction, energy, may, be, equally, divided, into, the, interaction, of, the, electron, with, the, polarized, charge, on, the, device, itself, due, to, the, presence, of, the, electron, and, the, amount, of, potential, energy,
