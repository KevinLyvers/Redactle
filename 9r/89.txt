the, sun, is, the, star, at, the, center, of, the, solar, system, it, is, a, massive, nearly, perfect, sphere, of, hot, plasma, heated, to, incandescence, by, nuclear, fusion, reactions, in, its, core, radiating, the, energy, from, its, surface, mainly, as, visible, light, and, infrared, radiation, with, 10, at, ultraviolet, energies, it, is, by, far, the, most, important, source, of, energy, for, life, on, earth, the, sun, has, been, an, object, of, veneration, in, many, cultures, it, has, been, a, central, subject, for, astronomical, research, since, antiquity, the, sun, orbits, the, galactic, center, at, a, distance, of, 24, 000, to, 28, 000, light, years, from, earth, it, is, 1, astronomical, unit, 1, 496, 10, 8, km, or, about, 8, light, minutes, away, its, diameter, is, about, 1, 391, 400, km, 864, 600, mi, 109, times, that, of, earth, its, mass, is, about, 330, 000, times, that, of, earth, making, up, about, 99, 86, of, the, total, mass, of, the, solar, system, roughly, three, quarters, of, the, sun, s, mass, consists, of, hydrogen, 73, the, rest, is, mostly, helium, 25, with, much, smaller, quantities, of, heavier, elements, including, oxygen, carbon, neon, and, iron, the, sun, is, a, g, type, main, sequence, star, g2v, informally, called, a, yellow, dwarf, though, its, light, is, actually, white, it, formed, approximately, 4, 6, billion, years, ago, from, the, gravitational, collapse, of, matter, within, a, region, of, a, large, molecular, cloud, most, of, this, matter, gathered, in, the, center, whereas, the, rest, flattened, into, an, orbiting, disk, that, became, the, solar, system, the, central, mass, became, so, hot, and, dense, that, it, eventually, initiated, nuclear, fusion, in, its, core, every, second, the, sun, s, core, fuses, about, 600, billion, kilograms, kg, of, hydrogen, into, helium, and, converts, 4, billion, kg, of, matter, into, energy, about, 4, to, 7, billion, years, from, now, when, hydrogen, fusion, in, the, sun, s, core, diminishes, to, the, point, where, the, sun, is, no, longer, in, hydrostatic, equilibrium, its, core, will, undergo, a, marked, increase, in, density, and, temperature, which, will, cause, its, outer, layers, to, expand, eventually, transforming, the, sun, into, a, red, giant, this, process, will, make, the, sun, large, enough, to, render, earth, uninhabitable, approximately, five, billion, years, from, the, present, after, the, red, giant, phase, models, suggest, the, sun, will, shed, its, outer, layers, and, become, a, dense, type, of, cooling, star, a, white, dwarf, and, no, longer, produce, energy, by, fusion, but, it, will, still, glow, and, give, off, heat, from, its, previous, fusion, for, perhaps, trillions, of, years, after, that, it, is, theorized, to, become, a, super, dense, black, dwarf, giving, off, negligible, energy, the, english, word, sun, developed, from, old, english, sunne, cognates, appear, in, other, germanic, languages, including, west, frisian, sinne, dutch, zon, low, german, s, nn, standard, german, sonne, bavarian, sunna, old, norse, sunna, and, gothic, sunn, all, these, words, stem, from, proto, germanic, sunn, n, this, is, ultimately, related, to, the, word, for, sun, in, other, branches, of, the, indo, european, language, family, though, in, most, cases, a, nominative, stem, with, an, l, is, found, rather, than, the, genitive, stem, in, n, as, for, example, in, latin, s, l, ancient, greek, h, lios, welsh, haul, and, czech, slunce, as, well, as, with, l, r, sanskrit, sv, r, and, persian, xvar, indeed, the, l, stem, survived, in, proto, germanic, as, well, as, s, welan, which, gave, rise, to, gothic, sauil, alongside, sunn, and, old, norse, prosaic, s, l, alongside, poetic, sunna, and, through, it, the, words, for, sun, in, the, modern, scandinavian, languages, swedish, and, danish, sol, icelandic, s, l, etc, the, principal, adjectives, for, the, sun, in, english, are, sunny, for, sunlight, and, in, technical, contexts, solar, s, o, l, r, from, latin, sol, the, latter, found, in, terms, such, as, solar, day, solar, eclipse, and, solar, system, from, the, greek, helios, comes, the, rare, adjective, heliac, h, i, l, i, k, in, english, the, greek, and, latin, words, occur, in, poetry, as, personifications, of, the, sun, helios, h, i, l, i, s, and, sol, s, l, while, in, science, fiction, sol, may, be, used, to, distinguish, the, sun, from, other, stars, the, term, sol, with, a, lower, case, s, is, used, by, planetary, astronomers, for, the, duration, of, a, solar, day, on, another, planet, such, as, mars, the, english, weekday, name, sunday, stems, from, old, english, sunnand, g, sun, s, day, a, germanic, interpretation, of, the, latin, phrase, di, s, s, lis, itself, a, translation, of, the, ancient, greek, h, mera, h, liou, day, of, the, sun, the, astronomical, symbol, for, the, sun, is, a, circle, with, a, center, dot, it, is, used, for, such, units, as, m, solar, mass, r, solar, radius, and, l, solar, luminosity, the, sun, is, a, g, type, main, sequence, star, that, makes, up, about, 99, 86, of, the, mass, of, the, solar, system, it, has, an, absolute, magnitude, of, 4, 83, estimated, to, be, brighter, than, about, 85, of, the, stars, in, the, milky, way, most, of, which, are, red, dwarfs, it, is, more, massive, than, 95, of, nearby, stars, within, 7, pc, 23lt, yrs, the, sun, is, a, population, i, or, heavy, element, rich, star, its, formation, approximately, 4, 6, billion, years, ago, may, have, been, triggered, by, shockwaves, from, one, or, more, nearby, supernovae, this, is, suggested, by, a, high, abundance, of, heavy, elements, in, the, solar, system, such, as, gold, and, uranium, relative, to, the, abundances, of, these, elements, in, so, called, population, ii, heavy, element, poor, stars, the, heavy, elements, could, most, plausibly, have, been, produced, by, endothermic, nuclear, reactions, during, a, supernova, or, by, transmutation, through, neutron, absorption, within, a, massive, second, generation, star, the, sun, is, by, far, the, brightest, object, in, the, earth, s, sky, with, an, apparent, magnitude, of, 26, 74, this, is, about, 13, billion, times, brighter, than, the, next, brightest, star, sirius, which, has, an, apparent, magnitude, of, 1, 46, one, astronomical, unit, about, 150, million, kilometres, 93, million, miles, is, defined, as, the, mean, distance, between, the, centres, of, the, sun, and, the, earth, the, instantaneous, distance, varies, by, about, 2, 5, million, km, or, 1, 55, million, miles, as, earth, moves, from, perihelion, on, january, 3rd, to, aphelion, on, july, 4th, at, its, average, distance, light, travels, from, the, sun, s, horizon, to, earth, s, horizon, in, about, 8, minutes, and, 20, seconds, while, light, from, the, closest, points, of, the, sun, and, earth, takes, about, two, seconds, less, the, energy, of, this, sunlight, supports, almost, all, life, on, earth, by, photosynthesis, and, drives, earth, s, climate, and, weather, the, sun, does, not, have, a, definite, boundary, but, its, density, decreases, exponentially, with, increasing, height, above, the, photosphere, for, the, purpose, of, measurement, the, sun, s, radius, is, considered, to, be, the, distance, from, its, center, to, the, edge, of, the, photosphere, the, apparent, visible, surface, of, the, sun, by, this, measure, the, sun, is, a, near, perfect, sphere, with, an, oblateness, estimated, at, 9, millionths, which, means, that, its, polar, diameter, differs, from, its, equatorial, diameter, by, only, 10, kilometers, 6, 2, mi, the, tidal, effect, of, the, planets, is, weak, and, does, not, significantly, affect, the, shape, of, the, sun, the, sun, rotates, faster, at, its, equator, than, at, its, poles, this, differential, rotation, is, caused, by, convective, motion, due, to, heat, transport, and, the, coriolis, force, due, to, the, sun, s, rotation, in, a, frame, of, reference, defined, by, the, stars, the, rotational, period, is, approximately, 25, 6, days, at, the, equator, and, 33, 5, days, at, the, poles, viewed, from, earth, as, it, orbits, the, sun, the, apparent, rotational, period, of, the, sun, at, its, equator, is, about, 28, days, viewed, from, a, vantage, point, above, its, north, pole, the, sun, rotates, counterclockwise, around, its, axis, of, spin, a, survey, of, solar, analogs, suggest, the, early, sun, was, rotating, up, to, ten, times, faster, than, it, does, today, this, would, have, made, the, surface, much, more, active, with, greater, x, ray, and, uv, emission, sun, spots, would, have, covered, 5, 30, of, the, surface, the, rotation, rate, was, gradually, slowed, by, magnetic, braking, as, the, sun, s, magnetic, field, interacted, with, the, outflowing, solar, wind, a, vestige, of, this, rapid, primordial, rotation, still, survives, at, the, sun, s, core, which, has, been, found, to, be, rotating, at, a, rate, of, once, per, week, four, times, the, mean, surface, rotation, rate, the, sun, consists, mainly, of, the, elements, hydrogen, and, helium, at, this, time, in, the, sun, s, life, they, account, for, 74, 9, and, 23, 8, respectively, of, the, mass, of, the, sun, in, the, photosphere, all, heavier, elements, called, metals, in, astronomy, account, for, less, than, 2, of, the, mass, with, oxygen, roughly, 1, of, the, sun, s, mass, carbon, 0, 3, neon, 0, 2, and, iron, 0, 2, being, the, most, abundant, the, sun, s, original, chemical, composition, was, inherited, from, the, interstellar, medium, out, of, which, it, formed, originally, it, would, have, been, about, 71, 1, hydrogen, 27, 4, helium, and, 1, 5, heavier, elements, the, hydrogen, and, most, of, the, helium, in, the, sun, would, have, been, produced, by, big, bang, nucleosynthesis, in, the, first, 20, minutes, of, the, universe, and, the, heavier, elements, were, produced, by, previous, generations, of, stars, before, the, sun, was, formed, and, spread, into, the, interstellar, medium, during, the, final, stages, of, stellar, life, and, by, events, such, as, supernovae, since, the, sun, formed, the, main, fusion, process, has, involved, fusing, hydrogen, into, helium, over, the, past, 4, 6, billion, years, the, amount, of, helium, and, its, location, within, the, sun, has, gradually, changed, the, proportion, of, helium, within, the, core, has, increased, from, about, 24, to, about, 60, due, to, fusion, and, some, of, the, helium, and, heavy, elements, have, settled, from, the, photosphere, toward, the, center, of, the, sun, because, of, gravity, the, proportions, of, heavier, elements, are, unchanged, heat, is, transferred, outward, from, the, sun, s, core, by, radiation, rather, than, by, convection, see, radiative, zone, below, so, the, fusion, products, are, not, lifted, outward, by, heat, they, remain, in, the, core, and, gradually, an, inner, core, of, helium, has, begun, to, form, that, cannot, be, fused, because, presently, the, sun, s, core, is, not, hot, or, dense, enough, to, fuse, helium, in, the, current, photosphere, the, helium, fraction, is, reduced, and, the, metallicity, is, only, 84, of, what, it, was, in, the, protostellar, phase, before, nuclear, fusion, in, the, core, started, in, the, future, helium, will, continue, to, accumulate, in, the, core, and, in, about, 5, billion, years, this, gradual, build, up, will, eventually, cause, the, sun, to, exit, the, main, sequence, and, become, a, red, giant, the, chemical, composition, of, the, photosphere, is, normally, considered, representative, of, the, composition, of, the, primordial, solar, system, typically, the, solar, heavy, element, abundances, described, above, are, measured, both, by, using, spectroscopy, of, the, sun, s, photosphere, and, by, measuring, abundances, in, meteorites, that, have, never, been, heated, to, melting, temperatures, these, meteorites, are, thought, to, retain, the, composition, of, the, protostellar, sun, and, are, thus, not, affected, by, the, settling, of, heavy, elements, the, two, methods, generally, agree, well, the, core, of, the, sun, extends, from, the, center, to, about, 20, 25, of, the, solar, radius, it, has, a, density, of, up, to, 150, g, cm, 3, about, 150, times, the, density, of, water, and, a, temperature, of, close, to, 15, 7, million, kelvin, k, by, contrast, the, sun, s, surface, temperature, is, about, 5800, k, recent, analysis, of, soho, mission, data, favors, the, idea, that, the, core, is, rotating, faster, than, the, radiative, zone, outside, it, through, most, of, the, sun, s, life, energy, has, been, produced, by, nuclear, fusion, in, the, core, region, through, the, proton, proton, chain, this, process, converts, hydrogen, into, helium, currently, 0, 8, of, the, energy, generated, in, the, sun, comes, from, another, sequence, of, fusion, reactions, called, the, cno, cycle, the, proportion, coming, from, the, cno, cycle, is, expected, to, increase, as, the, sun, becomes, older, and, more, luminous, the, core, is, the, only, region, of, the, sun, that, produces, an, appreciable, amount, of, thermal, energy, through, fusion, 99, of, the, sun, s, power, is, generated, in, the, innermost, 24, of, its, radius, and, almost, no, fusion, occurs, beyond, 30, of, the, radius, the, rest, of, the, sun, is, heated, by, this, energy, as, it, is, transferred, outward, through, many, successive, layers, finally, to, the, solar, photosphere, where, it, escapes, into, space, through, radiation, photons, or, advection, massive, particles, the, proton, proton, chain, occurs, around, 9, 2, 10, 37, times, each, second, in, the, core, converting, about, 3, 7, 10, 38, protons, into, alpha, particles, helium, nuclei, every, second, out, of, a, total, of, 8, 9, 10, 56, free, protons, in, the, sun, or, about, 6, 2, 10, 11, kg, s, however, each, proton, on, average, takes, around, 9, billion, years, to, fuse, with, another, using, the, pp, chain, fusing, four, free, protons, hydrogen, nuclei, into, a, single, alpha, particle, helium, nucleus, releases, around, 0, 7, of, the, fused, mass, as, energy, so, the, sun, releases, energy, at, the, mass, energy, conversion, rate, of, 4, 26, billion, kg, s, which, requires, 600, billion, kg, of, hydrogen, for, 384, 6, yottawatts, 3, 846, 10, 26, w, or, 9, 192, 10, 10, megatons, of, tnt, per, second, the, large, power, output, of, the, sun, is, mainly, due, to, the, huge, size, and, density, of, its, core, compared, to, earth, and, objects, on, earth, with, only, a, fairly, small, amount, of, power, being, generated, per, cubic, metre, theoretical, models, of, the, sun, s, interior, indicate, a, maximum, power, density, or, energy, production, of, approximately, 276, 5, watts, per, cubic, metre, at, the, center, of, the, core, which, according, to, karl, kruszelnicki, is, about, the, same, power, density, inside, a, compost, pile, the, fusion, rate, in, the, core, is, in, a, self, correcting, equilibrium, a, slightly, higher, rate, of, fusion, would, cause, the, core, to, heat, up, more, and, expand, slightly, against, the, weight, of, the, outer, layers, reducing, the, density, and, hence, the, fusion, rate, and, correcting, the, perturbation, and, a, slightly, lower, rate, would, cause, the, core, to, cool, and, shrink, slightly, increasing, the, density, and, increasing, the, fusion, rate, and, again, reverting, it, to, its, present, rate, the, radiative, zone, is, the, thickest, layer, of, the, sun, at, 0, 45, solar, radii, from, the, core, out, to, about, 0, 7, solar, radii, thermal, radiation, is, the, primary, means, of, energy, transfer, the, temperature, drops, from, approximately, 7, million, to, 2, million, kelvins, with, increasing, distance, from, the, core, this, temperature, gradient, is, less, than, the, value, of, the, adiabatic, lapse, rate, and, hence, cannot, drive, convection, which, explains, why, the, transfer, of, energy, through, this, zone, is, by, radiation, instead, of, thermal, convection, ions, of, hydrogen, and, helium, emit, photons, which, travel, only, a, brief, distance, before, being, reabsorbed, by, other, ions, the, density, drops, a, hundredfold, from, 20, 000, kg, m, 3, to, 200, kg, m, 3, between, 0, 25, solar, radii, and, 0, 7, radii, the, top, of, the, radiative, zone, the, radiative, zone, and, the, convective, zone, are, separated, by, a, transition, layer, the, tachocline, this, is, a, region, where, the, sharp, regime, change, between, the, uniform, rotation, of, the, radiative, zone, and, the, differential, rotation, of, the, convection, zone, results, in, a, large, shear, between, the, two, a, condition, where, successive, horizontal, layers, slide, past, one, another, presently, it, is, hypothesized, that, a, magnetic, dynamo, or, solar, dynamo, within, this, layer, generates, the, sun, s, magnetic, field, the, sun, s, convection, zone, extends, from, 0, 7, solar, radii, 500, 000, km, to, near, the, surface, in, this, layer, the, solar, plasma, is, not, dense, or, hot, enough, to, transfer, the, heat, energy, of, the, interior, outward, via, radiation, instead, the, density, of, the, plasma, is, low, enough, to, allow, convective, currents, to, develop, and, move, the, sun, s, energy, outward, towards, its, surface, material, heated, at, the, tachocline, picks, up, heat, and, expands, thereby, reducing, its, density, and, allowing, it, to, rise, as, a, result, an, orderly, motion, of, the, mass, develops, into, thermal, cells, that, carry, most, of, the, heat, outward, to, the, sun, s, photosphere, above, once, the, material, diffusively, and, radiatively, cools, just, beneath, the, photospheric, surface, its, density, increases, and, it, sinks, to, the, base, of, the, convection, zone, where, it, again, picks, up, heat, from, the, top, of, the, radiative, zone, and, the, convective, cycle, continues, at, the, photosphere, the, temperature, has, dropped, 350, fold, to, 5, 700, k, 9, 800, f, and, the, density, to, only, 0, 2, g, m, 3, about, 1, 10, 000, the, density, of, air, at, sea, level, and, 1, millionth, that, of, the, inner, layer, of, the, convective, zone, the, thermal, columns, of, the, convection, zone, form, an, imprint, on, the, surface, of, the, sun, giving, it, a, granular, appearance, called, the, solar, granulation, at, the, smallest, scale, and, supergranulation, at, larger, scales, turbulent, convection, in, this, outer, part, of, the, solar, interior, sustains, small, scale, dynamo, action, over, the, near, surface, volume, of, the, sun, the, sun, s, thermal, columns, are, b, nard, cells, and, take, the, shape, of, roughly, hexagonal, prisms, the, visible, surface, of, the, sun, the, photosphere, is, the, layer, below, which, the, sun, becomes, opaque, to, visible, light, photons, produced, in, this, layer, escape, the, sun, through, the, transparent, solar, atmosphere, above, it, and, become, solar, radiation, sunlight, the, change, in, opacity, is, due, to, the, decreasing, amount, of, h, ions, which, absorb, visible, light, easily, conversely, the, visible, light, perceived, is, produced, as, electrons, react, with, hydrogen, atoms, to, produce, h, ions, the, photosphere, is, tens, to, hundreds, of, kilometers, thick, and, is, slightly, less, opaque, than, air, on, earth, because, the, upper, part, of, the, photosphere, is, cooler, than, the, lower, part, an, image, of, the, sun, appears, brighter, in, the, center, than, on, the, edge, or, limb, of, the, solar, disk, in, a, phenomenon, known, as, limb, darkening, the, spectrum, of, sunlight, has, approximately, the, spectrum, of, a, black, body, radiating, at, 5, 772, k, 9, 930, f, interspersed, with, atomic, absorption, lines, from, the, tenuous, layers, above, the, photosphere, the, photosphere, has, a, particle, density, of, 10, 23, m, 3, about, 0, 37, of, the, particle, number, per, volume, of, earth, s, atmosphere, at, sea, level, the, photosphere, is, not, fully, ionized, the, extent, of, ionization, is, about, 3, leaving, almost, all, of, the, hydrogen, in, atomic, form, the, sun, s, atmosphere, is, composed, of, five, layers, the, photosphere, the, chromosphere, the, transition, region, the, corona, and, the, heliosphere, the, coolest, layer, of, the, sun, is, a, temperature, minimum, region, extending, to, about, 500, km, above, the, photosphere, and, has, a, temperature, of, about, 4, 100, k, this, part, of, the, sun, is, cool, enough, to, allow, for, the, existence, of, simple, molecules, such, as, carbon, monoxide, and, water, which, can, be, detected, via, their, absorption, spectra, the, chromosphere, transition, region, and, corona, are, much, hotter, than, the, surface, of, the, sun, the, reason, is, not, well, understood, but, evidence, suggests, that, alfv, n, waves, may, have, enough, energy, to, heat, the, corona, above, the, temperature, minimum, layer, is, a, layer, about, 2, 000, km, thick, dominated, by, a, spectrum, of, emission, and, absorption, lines, it, is, called, the, chromosphere, from, the, greek, root, chroma, meaning, color, because, the, chromosphere, is, visible, as, a, colored, flash, at, the, beginning, and, end, of, total, solar, eclipses, the, temperature, of, the, chromosphere, increases, gradually, with, altitude, ranging, up, to, around, 20, 000, k, near, the, top, in, the, upper, part, of, the, chromosphere, helium, becomes, partially, ionized, above, the, chromosphere, in, a, thin, about, 200, km, transition, region, the, temperature, rises, rapidly, from, around, 20, 000, k, in, the, upper, chromosphere, to, coronal, temperatures, closer, to, 1, 000, 000, k, the, temperature, increase, is, facilitated, by, the, full, ionization, of, helium, in, the, transition, region, which, significantly, reduces, radiative, cooling, of, the, plasma, the, transition, region, does, not, occur, at, a, well, defined, altitude, rather, it, forms, a, kind, of, nimbus, around, chromospheric, features, such, as, spicules, and, filaments, and, is, in, constant, chaotic, motion, the, transition, region, is, not, easily, visible, from, earth, s, surface, but, is, readily, observable, from, space, by, instruments, sensitive, to, the, extreme, ultraviolet, portion, of, the, spectrum, the, corona, is, the, next, layer, of, the, sun, the, low, corona, near, the, surface, of, the, sun, has, a, particle, density, around, 10, 15, m, 3, to, 10, 16, m, 3, the, average, temperature, of, the, corona, and, solar, wind, is, about, 1, 000, 000, 2, 000, 000, k, however, in, the, hottest, regions, it, is, 8, 000, 000, 20, 000, 000, k, although, no, complete, theory, yet, exists, to, account, for, the, temperature, of, the, corona, at, least, some, of, its, heat, is, known, to, be, from, magnetic, reconnection, the, corona, is, the, extended, atmosphere, of, the, sun, which, has, a, volume, much, larger, than, the, volume, enclosed, by, the, sun, s, photosphere, a, flow, of, plasma, outward, from, the, sun, into, interplanetary, space, is, the, solar, wind, the, heliosphere, the, tenuous, outermost, atmosphere, of, the, sun, is, filled, with, solar, wind, plasma, this, outermost, layer, of, the, sun, is, defined, to, begin, at, the, distance, where, the, flow, of, the, solar, wind, becomes, superalfv, nic, that, is, where, the, flow, becomes, faster, than, the, speed, of, alfv, n, waves, at, approximately, 20, solar, radii, 0, 1, au, turbulence, and, dynamic, forces, in, the, heliosphere, cannot, affect, the, shape, of, the, solar, corona, within, because, the, information, can, only, travel, at, the, speed, of, alfv, n, waves, the, solar, wind, travels, outward, continuously, through, the, heliosphere, forming, the, solar, magnetic, field, into, a, spiral, shape, until, it, impacts, the, heliopause, more, than, 50, au, from, the, sun, in, december, 2004, the, voyager, 1, probe, passed, through, a, shock, front, that, is, thought, to, be, part, of, the, heliopause, in, late, 2012, voyager, 1, recorded, a, marked, increase, in, cosmic, ray, collisions, and, a, sharp, drop, in, lower, energy, particles, from, the, solar, wind, which, suggested, that, the, probe, had, passed, through, the, heliopause, and, entered, the, interstellar, medium, and, indeed, did, so, on, august, 25, 2012, at, approximately, 122, astronomical, units, 18, tm, from, the, sun, the, heliosphere, has, a, heliotail, which, stretches, out, behind, it, due, to, the, sun, s, peculiar, motion, through, the, galaxy, on, april, 28, 2021, nasa, s, parker, solar, probe, encountered, the, specific, magnetic, and, particle, conditions, at, 18, 8, solar, radii, that, indicated, that, it, penetrated, the, alfv, n, surface, the, boundary, separating, the, corona, from, the, solar, wind, defined, as, where, the, coronal, plasma, s, alfv, n, speed, and, the, large, scale, solar, wind, speed, are, equal, during, the, flyby, parker, solar, probe, passed, into, and, out, of, the, corona, several, times, this, proved, the, predictions, that, the, alfv, n, critical, surface, is, not, shaped, like, a, smooth, ball, but, has, spikes, and, valleys, that, wrinkle, its, surface, the, sun, emits, light, across, the, visible, spectrum, so, its, color, is, white, with, a, cie, color, space, index, near, 0, 3, 0, 3, when, viewed, from, space, or, when, the, sun, is, high, in, the, sky, the, solar, radiance, per, wavelength, peaks, in, the, green, portion, of, the, spectrum, when, viewed, from, space, when, the, sun, is, very, low, in, the, sky, atmospheric, scattering, renders, the, sun, yellow, red, orange, or, magenta, and, in, rare, occasions, even, green, or, blue, despite, its, typical, whiteness, white, sunrays, white, ambient, light, white, illumination, of, the, moon, etc, some, cultures, mentally, picture, the, sun, as, yellow, and, some, even, red, the, reasons, for, this, are, cultural, and, exact, ones, are, the, subject, of, debate, the, sun, is, classed, as, a, g2, star, meaning, it, is, a, g, type, main, sequence, star, with, 2, indicating, its, surface, temperature, is, in, the, second, range, of, the, g, class, the, solar, constant, is, the, amount, of, power, that, the, sun, deposits, per, unit, area, that, is, directly, exposed, to, sunlight, the, solar, constant, is, equal, to, approximately, 1, 368, w, m, 2, watts, per, square, meter, at, a, distance, of, one, astronomical, unit, au, from, the, sun, that, is, at, or, near, earth, s, orbit, sunlight, on, the, surface, of, earth, is, attenuated, by, earth, s, atmosphere, so, that, less, power, arrives, at, the, surface, closer, to, 1, 000, w, m, 2, in, clear, conditions, when, the, sun, is, near, the, zenith, sunlight, at, the, top, of, earth, s, atmosphere, is, composed, by, total, energy, of, about, 50, infrared, light, 40, visible, light, and, 10, ultraviolet, light, the, atmosphere, filters, out, over, 70, of, solar, ultraviolet, especially, at, the, shorter, wavelengths, solar, ultraviolet, radiation, ionizes, earth, s, dayside, upper, atmosphere, creating, the, electrically, conducting, ionosphere, ultraviolet, light, from, the, sun, has, antiseptic, properties, and, can, be, used, to, sanitize, tools, and, water, this, radiation, causes, sunburn, and, has, other, biological, effects, such, as, the, production, of, vitamin, d, and, sun, tanning, it, is, the, main, cause, of, skin, cancer, ultraviolet, light, is, strongly, attenuated, by, earth, s, ozone, layer, so, that, the, amount, of, uv, varies, greatly, with, latitude, and, has, been, partially, responsible, for, many, biological, adaptations, including, variations, in, human, skin, color, in, different, regions, of, the, earth, high, energy, gamma, ray, photons, initially, released, with, fusion, reactions, in, the, core, are, almost, immediately, absorbed, by, the, solar, plasma, of, the, radiative, zone, usually, after, traveling, only, a, few, millimeters, re, emission, happens, in, a, random, direction, and, usually, at, slightly, lower, energy, with, this, sequence, of, emissions, and, absorptions, it, takes, a, long, time, for, radiation, to, reach, the, sun, s, surface, estimates, of, the, photon, travel, time, range, between, 10, 000, and, 170, 000, years, in, contrast, it, takes, only, 2, 3, seconds, for, neutrinos, which, account, for, about, 2, of, the, total, energy, production, of, the, sun, to, reach, the, surface, because, energy, transport, in, the, sun, is, a, process, that, involves, photons, in, thermodynamic, equilibrium, with, matter, the, time, scale, of, energy, transport, in, the, sun, is, longer, on, the, order, of, 30, 000, 000, years, this, is, the, time, it, would, take, the, sun, to, return, to, a, stable, state, if, the, rate, of, energy, generation, in, its, core, were, suddenly, changed, electron, neutrinos, are, released, by, fusion, reactions, in, the, core, but, unlike, photons, they, rarely, interact, with, matter, so, almost, all, are, able, to, escape, the, sun, immediately, however, measurements, of, the, number, of, these, neutrinos, produced, in, the, sun, are, lower, than, theories, predict, by, a, factor, of, 3, in, 2001, the, discovery, of, neutrino, oscillation, resolved, the, discrepancy, the, sun, emits, the, number, of, electron, neutrinos, predicted, by, the, theory, but, neutrino, detectors, were, missing, 2, 3, of, them, because, the, neutrinos, had, changed, flavor, by, the, time, they, were, detected, the, sun, has, a, stellar, magnetic, field, that, varies, across, its, surface, its, polar, field, is, 1, 2, gauss, 0, 0001, 0, 0002, t, whereas, the, field, is, typically, 3, 000, gauss, 0, 3, t, in, features, on, the, sun, called, sunspots, and, 10, 100, gauss, 0, 001, 0, 01, t, in, solar, prominences, the, magnetic, field, varies, in, time, and, location, the, quasi, periodic, 11, year, solar, cycle, is, the, most, prominent, variation, in, which, the, number, and, size, of, sunspots, waxes, and, wanes, the, solar, magnetic, field, extends, well, beyond, the, sun, itself, the, electrically, conducting, solar, wind, plasma, carries, the, sun, s, magnetic, field, into, space, forming, what, is, called, the, interplanetary, magnetic, field, in, an, approximation, known, as, ideal, magnetohydrodynamics, plasma, particles, only, move, along, magnetic, field, lines, as, a, result, the, outward, flowing, solar, wind, stretches, the, interplanetary, magnetic, field, outward, forcing, it, into, a, roughly, radial, structure, for, a, simple, dipolar, solar, magnetic, field, with, opposite, hemispherical, polarities, on, either, side, of, the, solar, magnetic, equator, a, thin, current, sheet, is, formed, in, the, solar, wind, at, great, distances, the, rotation, of, the, sun, twists, the, dipolar, magnetic, field, and, corresponding, current, sheet, into, an, archimedean, spiral, structure, called, the, parker, spiral, sunspots, are, visible, as, dark, patches, on, the, sun, s, photosphere, and, correspond, to, concentrations, of, magnetic, field, where, convective, transport, of, heat, is, inhibited, from, the, solar, interior, to, the, surface, as, a, result, sunspots, are, slightly, cooler, than, the, surrounding, photosphere, so, they, appear, dark, at, a, typical, solar, minimum, few, sunspots, are, visible, and, occasionally, none, can, be, seen, at, all, those, that, do, appear, are, at, high, solar, latitudes, as, the, solar, cycle, progresses, toward, its, maximum, sunspots, tend, to, form, closer, to, the, solar, equator, a, phenomenon, known, as, sp, rer, s, law, the, largest, sunspots, can, be, tens, of, thousands, of, kilometers, across, an, 11, year, sunspot, cycle, is, half, of, a, 22, year, babcock, leighton, dynamo, cycle, which, corresponds, to, an, oscillatory, exchange, of, energy, between, toroidal, and, poloidal, solar, magnetic, fields, at, solar, cycle, maximum, the, external, poloidal, dipolar, magnetic, field, is, near, its, dynamo, cycle, minimum, strength, but, an, internal, toroidal, quadrupolar, field, generated, through, differential, rotation, within, the, tachocline, is, near, its, maximum, strength, at, this, point, in, the, dynamo, cycle, buoyant, upwelling, within, the, convective, zone, forces, emergence, of, the, toroidal, magnetic, field, through, the, photosphere, giving, rise, to, pairs, of, sunspots, roughly, aligned, east, west, and, having, footprints, with, opposite, magnetic, polarities, the, magnetic, polarity, of, sunspot, pairs, alternates, every, solar, cycle, a, phenomenon, described, by, hale, s, law, during, the, solar, cycle, s, declining, phase, energy, shifts, from, the, internal, toroidal, magnetic, field, to, the, external, poloidal, field, and, sunspots, diminish, in, number, and, size, at, solar, cycle, minimum, the, toroidal, field, is, correspondingly, at, minimum, strength, sunspots, are, relatively, rare, and, the, poloidal, field, is, at, its, maximum, strength, with, the, rise, of, the, next, 11, year, sunspot, cycle, differential, rotation, shifts, magnetic, energy, back, from, the, poloidal, to, the, toroidal, field, but, with, a, polarity, that, is, opposite, to, the, previous, cycle, the, process, carries, on, continuously, and, in, an, idealized, simplified, scenario, each, 11, year, sunspot, cycle, corresponds, to, a, change, then, in, the, overall, polarity, of, the, sun, s, large, scale, magnetic, field, the, sun, s, magnetic, field, leads, to, many, effects, that, are, collectively, called, solar, activity, solar, flares, and, coronal, mass, ejections, tend, to, occur, at, sunspot, groups, slowly, changing, high, speed, streams, of, solar, wind, are, emitted, from, coronal, holes, at, the, photospheric, surface, both, coronal, mass, ejections, and, high, speed, streams, of, solar, wind, carry, plasma, and, the, interplanetary, magnetic, field, outward, into, the, solar, system, the, effects, of, solar, activity, on, earth, include, auroras, at, moderate, to, high, latitudes, and, the, disruption, of, radio, communications, and, electric, power, solar, activity, is, thought, to, have, played, a, large, role, in, the, formation, and, evolution, of, the, solar, system, long, term, secular, change, in, sunspot, number, is, thought, by, some, scientists, to, be, correlated, with, long, term, change, in, solar, irradiance, which, in, turn, might, influence, earth, s, long, term, climate, the, solar, cycle, influences, space, weather, conditions, including, those, surrounding, earth, for, example, in, the, 17th, century, the, solar, cycle, appeared, to, have, stopped, entirely, for, several, decades, few, sunspots, were, observed, during, a, period, known, as, the, maunder, minimum, this, coincided, in, time, with, the, era, of, the, little, ice, age, when, europe, experienced, unusually, cold, temperatures, earlier, extended, minima, have, been, discovered, through, analysis, of, tree, rings, and, appear, to, have, coincided, with, lower, than, average, global, temperatures, the, sun, today, is, roughly, halfway, through, the, main, sequence, portion, of, its, life, it, has, not, changed, dramatically, in, over, four, billion, years, and, will, remain, fairly, stable, for, about, five, billion, more, however, after, hydrogen, fusion, in, its, core, has, stopped, the, sun, will, undergo, dramatic, changes, both, internally, and, externally, the, sun, formed, about, 4, 6, billion, years, ago, from, the, collapse, of, part, of, a, giant, molecular, cloud, that, consisted, mostly, of, hydrogen, and, helium, and, that, probably, gave, birth, to, many, other, stars, this, age, is, estimated, using, computer, models, of, stellar, evolution, and, through, nucleocosmochronology, the, result, is, consistent, with, the, radiometric, date, of, the, oldest, solar, system, material, at, 4, 567, billion, years, ago, studies, of, ancient, meteorites, reveal, traces, of, stable, daughter, nuclei, of, short, lived, isotopes, such, as, iron, 60, that, form, only, in, exploding, short, lived, stars, this, indicates, that, one, or, more, supernovae, must, have, occurred, near, the, location, where, the, sun, formed, a, shock, wave, from, a, nearby, supernova, would, have, triggered, the, formation, of, the, sun, by, compressing, the, matter, within, the, molecular, cloud, and, causing, certain, regions, to, collapse, under, their, own, gravity, as, one, fragment, of, the, cloud, collapsed, it, also, began, to, rotate, due, to, conservation, of, angular, momentum, and, heat, up, with, the, increasing, pressure, much, of, the, mass, became, concentrated, in, the, center, whereas, the, rest, flattened, out, into, a, disk, that, would, become, the, planets, and, other, solar, system, bodies, gravity, and, pressure, within, the, core, of, the, cloud, generated, a, lot, of, heat, as, it, accumulated, more, matter, from, the, surrounding, disk, eventually, triggering, nuclear, fusion, the, stars, hd, 162826, and, hd, 186302, share, similarities, with, the, sun, and, are, thus, hypothesized, to, be, its, stellar, siblings, formed, in, the, same, molecular, cloud, the, sun, is, about, halfway, through, its, main, sequence, stage, during, which, nuclear, fusion, reactions, in, its, core, fuse, hydrogen, into, helium, each, second, more, than, four, billion, kilograms, of, matter, are, converted, into, energy, within, the, sun, s, core, producing, neutrinos, and, solar, radiation, at, this, rate, the, sun, has, so, far, converted, around, 100, times, the, mass, of, earth, into, energy, about, 0, 03, of, the, total, mass, of, the, sun, the, sun, will, spend, a, total, of, approximately, 10, to, 11, billion, years, as, a, main, sequence, star, before, the, red, giant, phase, of, the, sun, at, the, 8, billion, year, mark, the, sun, will, be, at, its, hottest, point, according, to, the, esa, s, gaia, space, observatory, mission, in, 2022, the, sun, is, gradually, becoming, hotter, in, its, core, hotter, at, the, surface, larger, in, radius, and, more, luminous, during, its, time, on, the, main, sequence, since, the, beginning, of, its, main, sequence, life, it, has, expanded, in, radius, by, 15, and, the, surface, has, increased, in, temperature, from, 5, 620, k, 9, 660, f, to, 5, 772, k, 9, 930, f, resulting, in, a, 48, increase, in, luminosity, from, 0, 677, solar, luminosities, to, its, present, day, 1, 0, solar, luminosity, this, occurs, because, the, helium, atoms, in, the, core, have, a, higher, mean, molecular, weight, than, the, hydrogen, atoms, that, were, fused, resulting, in, less, thermal, pressure, the, core, is, therefore, shrinking, allowing, the, outer, layers, of, the, sun, to, move, closer, to, the, center, releasing, gravitational, potential, energy, according, to, the, virial, theorem, half, of, this, released, gravitational, energy, goes, into, heating, which, leads, to, a, gradual, increase, in, the, rate, at, which, fusion, occurs, and, thus, an, increase, in, the, luminosity, this, process, speeds, up, as, the, core, gradually, becomes, denser, at, present, it, is, increasing, in, brightness, by, about, 1, every, 100, million, years, it, will, take, at, least, 1, billion, years, from, now, to, deplete, liquid, water, from, the, earth, from, such, increase, after, that, the, earth, will, cease, to, be, able, to, support, complex, multicellular, life, and, the, last, remaining, multicellular, organisms, on, the, planet, will, suffer, a, final, complete, mass, extinction, the, sun, does, not, have, enough, mass, to, explode, as, a, supernova, instead, when, it, runs, out, of, hydrogen, in, the, core, in, approximately, 5, billion, years, core, hydrogen, fusion, will, stop, and, there, will, be, nothing, to, prevent, the, core, from, contracting, the, release, of, gravitational, potential, energy, will, cause, the, luminosity, of, the, sun, to, increase, ending, the, main, sequence, phase, and, leading, the, sun, to, expand, over, the, next, billion, years, first, into, a, subgiant, and, then, into, a, red, giant, the, heating, due, to, gravitational, contraction, will, also, lead, to, expansion, of, the, sun, and, hydrogen, fusion, in, a, shell, just, outside, the, core, where, unfused, hydrogen, remains, contributing, to, the, increased, luminosity, which, will, eventually, reach, more, than, 1, 000, times, its, present, luminosity, when, the, sun, enters, its, red, giant, branch, rgb, phase, it, will, engulf, and, very, likely, destroy, mercury, and, venus, according, to, a, 2008, paper, earth, s, orbit, will, have, initially, expanded, to, at, most, 1, 5, au, 220, million, km, 140, million, mi, due, to, the, sun, s, loss, of, mass, however, earth, s, orbit, will, then, start, shrinking, due, to, tidal, forces, and, eventually, drag, from, the, lower, chromosphere, so, that, it, is, engulfed, by, the, sun, during, the, tip, of, the, red, giant, branch, phase, 7, 59, billion, years, from, now, 3, 8, and, 1, million, years, after, mercury, and, venus, have, respectively, suffered, the, same, fate, by, the, time, the, sun, reaches, the, tip, of, the, red, giant, branch, it, will, be, about, 256, times, larger, than, it, is, today, with, a, radius, of, 1, 19, au, 178, million, km, 111, million, mi, the, sun, will, spend, around, a, billion, years, in, the, rgb, and, lose, around, a, third, of, its, mass, after, the, red, giant, branch, the, sun, has, approximately, 120, million, years, of, active, life, left, but, much, happens, first, the, core, full, of, degenerate, helium, ignites, violently, in, the, helium, flash, it, is, estimated, that, 6, of, the, core, itself, 40, of, the, sun, s, mass, will, be, converted, into, carbon, within, a, matter, of, minutes, through, the, triple, alpha, process, the, sun, then, shrinks, to, around, 10, times, its, current, size, and, 50, times, the, luminosity, with, a, temperature, a, little, lower, than, today, it, will, then, have, reached, the, red, clump, or, horizontal, branch, but, a, star, of, the, sun, s, metallicity, does, not, evolve, blueward, along, the, horizontal, branch, instead, it, just, becomes, moderately, larger, and, more, luminous, over, about, 100, million, years, as, it, continues, to, react, helium, in, the, core, when, the, helium, is, exhausted, the, sun, will, repeat, the, expansion, it, followed, when, the, hydrogen, in, the, core, was, exhausted, this, time, however, it, all, happens, faster, and, the, sun, becomes, larger, and, more, luminous, this, is, the, asymptotic, giant, branch, phase, and, the, sun, is, alternately, reacting, hydrogen, in, a, shell, or, helium, in, a, deeper, shell, after, about, 20, million, years, on, the, early, asymptotic, giant, branch, the, sun, becomes, increasingly, unstable, with, rapid, mass, loss, and, thermal, pulses, that, increase, the, size, and, luminosity, for, a, few, hundred, years, every, 100, 000, years, or, so, the, thermal, pulses, become, larger, each, time, with, the, later, pulses, pushing, the, luminosity, to, as, much, as, 5, 000, times, the, current, level, despite, this, the, sun, s, maximum, agb, radius, will, not, be, as, large, as, its, tip, rgb, maximum, 179, r, or, about, 0, 832, au, 124, 5, million, km, 77, 3, million, mi, models, vary, depending, on, the, rate, and, timing, of, mass, loss, models, that, have, higher, mass, loss, on, the, red, giant, branch, produce, smaller, less, luminous, stars, at, the, tip, of, the, asymptotic, giant, branch, perhaps, only, 2, 000, times, the, luminosity, and, less, than, 200, times, the, radius, for, the, sun, four, thermal, pulses, are, predicted, before, it, completely, loses, its, outer, envelope, and, starts, to, make, a, planetary, nebula, the, post, asymptotic, giant, branch, evolution, is, even, faster, the, luminosity, stays, approximately, constant, as, the, temperature, increases, with, the, ejected, half, of, the, sun, s, mass, becoming, ionized, into, a, planetary, nebula, as, the, exposed, core, reaches, 30, 000, k, 53, 500, f, as, if, it, is, in, a, sort, of, blue, loop, the, final, naked, core, a, white, dwarf, will, have, a, temperature, of, over, 100, 000, k, 180, 000, f, and, contain, an, estimated, 54, 05, of, the, sun, s, present, day, mass, simulations, indicate, that, the, sun, may, be, among, the, least, massive, stars, capable, of, forming, a, planetary, nebula, the, planetary, nebula, will, disperse, in, about, 10, 000, years, but, the, white, dwarf, will, survive, for, trillions, of, years, before, fading, to, a, hypothetical, super, dense, black, dwarf, as, such, it, would, give, off, no, more, energy, for, an, even, longer, time, than, it, was, a, white, dwarf, the, sun, has, eight, known, planets, orbiting, it, this, includes, four, terrestrial, planets, mercury, venus, earth, and, mars, two, gas, giants, jupiter, and, saturn, and, two, ice, giants, uranus, and, neptune, the, solar, system, also, has, nine, bodies, generally, considered, as, dwarf, planets, and, some, more, candidates, an, asteroid, belt, numerous, comets, and, a, large, number, of, icy, bodies, which, lie, beyond, the, orbit, of, neptune, six, of, the, planets, and, many, smaller, bodies, also, have, their, own, natural, satellites, in, particular, the, satellite, systems, of, jupiter, saturn, and, uranus, are, in, some, ways, like, miniature, versions, of, the, sun, s, system, the, sun, is, moved, by, the, gravitational, pull, of, the, planets, the, center, of, the, sun, moves, around, the, solar, system, barycenter, within, a, range, from, 0, 1, to, 2, 2, solar, radii, the, sun, s, motion, around, the, barycenter, approximately, repeats, every, 179, years, rotated, by, about, 30, due, primarily, to, the, synodic, period, of, jupiter, and, saturn, within, 10, light, years, of, the, sun, there, are, relatively, few, stars, the, closest, being, the, triple, star, system, alpha, centauri, which, is, about, 4, 4, light, years, away, and, may, be, in, the, local, bubble, s, g, cloud, alpha, centauri, a, and, b, are, a, closely, tied, pair, of, sun, like, stars, whereas, the, closest, star, to, sun, the, small, red, dwarf, proxima, centauri, orbits, the, pair, at, a, distance, of, 0, 2, light, years, in, 2016, a, potentially, habitable, exoplanet, was, found, to, be, orbiting, proxima, centauri, called, proxima, centauri, b, the, closest, confirmed, exoplanet, to, the, sun, the, solar, system, is, surrounded, by, the, local, interstellar, cloud, although, it, is, not, clear, if, it, is, embedded, in, the, local, interstellar, cloud, or, if, it, lies, just, outside, the, cloud, s, edge, multiple, other, interstellar, clouds, exist, in, the, region, within, 300, light, years, of, the, sun, known, as, the, local, bubble, the, latter, feature, is, an, hourglass, shaped, cavity, or, superbubble, in, the, interstellar, medium, roughly, 300, light, years, across, the, bubble, is, suffused, with, high, temperature, plasma, suggesting, that, it, may, be, the, product, of, several, recent, supernovae, the, local, bubble, is, a, small, superbubble, compared, to, the, neighboring, wider, radcliffe, wave, and, split, linear, structures, formerly, gould, belt, each, of, which, are, some, thousands, of, light, years, in, length, all, these, structures, are, part, of, the, orion, arm, which, contains, most, of, the, stars, in, the, milky, way, that, are, visible, to, the, unaided, eye, groups, of, stars, form, together, in, star, clusters, before, dissolving, into, co, moving, associations, a, prominent, grouping, that, is, visible, to, the, naked, eye, is, the, ursa, major, moving, group, which, is, around, 80, light, years, away, within, the, local,

the, sun, was, thought, to, be, a, solar, deity, or, other, supernatural, entity, the, sun, has, played, an, important, part, in, many, world, religions, as, described, in, a, later, section, in, the, early, first, millennium, bc, babylonian, astronomers, observed, that, the, sun, s, motion, along, the, ecliptic, is, not, uniform, though, they, did, not, know, why, it, is, today, known, that, this, is, due, to, the, movement, of, earth, in, an, elliptic, orbit, around, the, sun, with, earth, moving, faster, when, it, is, nearer, to, the, sun, at, perihelion, and, moving, slower, when, it, is, farther, away, at, aphelion, one, of, the, first, people, to, offer, a, scientific, or, philosophical, explanation, for, the, sun, was, the, greek, philosopher, anaxagoras, he, reasoned, that, it, was, not, the, chariot, of, helios, but, instead, a, giant, flaming, ball, of, metal, even, larger, than, the, land, of, the, peloponnesus, and, that, the, moon, reflected, the, light, of, the, sun, for, teaching, this, heresy, he, was, imprisoned, by, the, authorities, and, sentenced, to, death, though, he, was, later, released, through, the, intervention, of, pericles, eratosthenes, estimated, the, distance, between, earth, and, the, sun, in, the, third, century, bc, as, of, stadia, myriads, 400, and, 80000, the, translation, of, which, is, ambiguous, implying, either, 4, 080, 000, stadia, 755, 000, km, or, 804, 000, 000, stadia, 148, to, 153, million, kilometers, or, 0, 99, to, 1, 02, au, the, latter, value, is, correct, to, within, a, few, percent, in, the, first, century, ad, ptolemy, estimated, the, distance, as, 1, 210, times, the, radius, of, earth, approximately, 7, 71, million, kilometers, 0, 0515, au, the, theory, that, the, sun, is, the, center, around, which, the, planets, orbit, was, first, proposed, by, the, ancient, greek, aristarchus, of, samos, in, the, third, century, bc, and, later, adopted, by, seleucus, of, seleucia, see, heliocentrism, this, view, was, developed, in, a, more, detailed, mathematical, model, of, a, heliocentric, system, in, the, 16th, century, by, nicolaus, copernicus, observations, of, sunspots, were, recorded, during, the, han, dynasty, 206, bc, ad, 220, by, chinese, astronomers, who, maintained, records, of, these, observations, for, centuries, averroes, also, provided, a, description, of, sunspots, in, the, 12th, century, the, invention, of, the, telescope, in, the, early, 17th, century, permitted, detailed, observations, of, sunspots, by, thomas, harriot, galileo, galilei, and, other, astronomers, galileo, posited, that, sunspots, were, on, the, surface, of, the, sun, rather, than, small, objects, passing, between, earth, and, the, sun, arabic, astronomical, contributions, include, al, battani, s, discovery, that, the, direction, of, the, sun, s, apogee, the, place, in, the, sun, s, orbit, against, the, fixed, stars, where, it, seems, to, be, moving, slowest, is, changing, in, modern, heliocentric, terms, this, is, caused, by, a, gradual, motion, of, the, aphelion, of, the, earth, s, orbit, ibn, yunus, observed, more, than, 10, 000, entries, for, the, sun, s, position, for, many, years, using, a, large, astrolabe, from, an, observation, of, a, transit, of, venus, in, 1032, the, persian, astronomer, and, polymath, ibn, sina, concluded, that, venus, was, closer, to, earth, than, the, sun, in, 1677, edmond, halley, observed, a, transit, of, mercury, across, the, sun, leading, him, to, realize, that, observations, of, the, solar, parallax, of, a, planet, more, ideally, using, the, transit, of, venus, could, be, used, to, trigonometrically, determine, the, distances, between, earth, venus, and, the, sun, careful, observations, of, the, 1769, transit, of, venus, allowed, astronomers, to, calculate, the, average, earth, sun, distance, as, 93, 726, 900, miles, 150, 838, 800, km, only, 0, 8, greater, than, the, modern, value, in, 1666, isaac, newton, observed, the, sun, s, light, using, a, prism, and, showed, that, it, is, made, up, of, light, of, many, colors, in, 1800, william, herschel, discovered, infrared, radiation, beyond, the, red, part, of, the, solar, spectrum, the, 19th, century, saw, advancement, in, spectroscopic, studies, of, the, sun, joseph, von, fraunhofer, recorded, more, than, 600, absorption, lines, in, the, spectrum, the, strongest, of, which, are, still, often, referred, to, as, fraunhofer, lines, the, 20th, century, brought, about, several, specialized, systems, for, observing, the, sun, especially, at, different, narrowband, wavelengths, such, as, those, using, calcium, h, 396, 9, nm, k, 393, 37, nm, and, hydrogen, alpha, 656, 46, nm, filtering, during, early, studies, of, the, optical, spectrum, of, the, photosphere, some, absorption, lines, were, found, that, did, not, correspond, to, any, chemical, elements, then, known, on, earth, in, 1868, norman, lockyer, hypothesized, that, these, absorption, lines, were, caused, by, a, new, element, that, he, dubbed, helium, after, the, greek, sun, god, helios, twenty, five, years, later, helium, was, isolated, on, earth, in, the, early, years, of, the, modern, scientific, era, the, source, of, the, sun, s, energy, was, a, significant, puzzle, lord, kelvin, suggested, that, the, sun, is, a, gradually, cooling, liquid, body, that, is, radiating, an, internal, store, of, heat, kelvin, and, hermann, von, helmholtz, then, proposed, a, gravitational, contraction, mechanism, to, explain, the, energy, output, but, the, resulting, age, estimate, was, only, 20, million, years, well, short, of, the, time, span, of, at, least, 300, million, years, suggested, by, some, geological, discoveries, of, that, time, in, 1890, joseph, lockyer, who, discovered, helium, in, the, solar, spectrum, proposed, a, meteoritic, hypothesis, for, the, formation, and, evolution, of, the, sun, not, until, 1904, was, a, documented, solution, offered, ernest, rutherford, suggested, that, the, sun, s, output, could, be, maintained, by, an, internal, source, of, heat, and, suggested, radioactive, decay, as, the, source, however, it, would, be, albert, einstein, who, would, provide, the, essential, clue, to, the, source, of, the, sun, s, energy, output, with, his, mass, energy, equivalence, relation, e, mc, 2, in, 1920, sir, arthur, eddington, proposed, that, the, pressures, and, temperatures, at, the, core, of, the, sun, could, produce, a, nuclear, fusion, reaction, that, merged, hydrogen, protons, into, helium, nuclei, resulting, in, a, production, of, energy, from, the, net, change, in, mass, the, preponderance, of, hydrogen, in, the, sun, was, confirmed, in, 1925, by, cecilia, payne, using, the, ionization, theory, developed, by, meghnad, saha, the, theoretical, concept, of, fusion, was, developed, in, the, 1930s, by, the, astrophysicists, subrahmanyan, chandrasekhar, and, hans, bethe, hans, bethe, calculated, the, details, of, the, two, main, energy, producing, nuclear, reactions, that, power, the, sun, in, 1957, margaret, burbidge, geoffrey, burbidge, william, fowler, and, fred, hoyle, showed, that, most, of, the, elements, in, the, universe, have, been, synthesized, by, nuclear, reactions, inside, stars, some, like, the, sun, the, first, satellites, designed, for, long, term, observation, of, the, sun, from, interplanetary, space, were, nasa, s, pioneers, 6, 7, 8, and, 9, which, were, launched, between, 1959, and, 1968, these, probes, orbited, the, sun, at, a, distance, similar, to, that, of, earth, and, made, the, first, detailed, measurements, of, the, solar, wind, and, the, solar, magnetic, field, pioneer, 9, operated, for, a, particularly, long, time, transmitting, data, until, may, 1983, in, the, 1970s, two, helios, spacecraft, and, the, skylab, apollo, telescope, mount, provided, scientists, with, significant, new, data, on, solar, wind, and, the, solar, corona, the, helios, 1, and, 2, probes, were, u, s, german, collaborations, that, studied, the, solar, wind, from, an, orbit, carrying, the, spacecraft, inside, mercury, s, orbit, at, perihelion, the, skylab, space, station, launched, by, nasa, in, 1973, included, a, solar, observatory, module, called, the, apollo, telescope, mount, that, was, operated, by, astronauts, resident, on, the, station, skylab, made, the, first, time, resolved, observations, of, the, solar, transition, region, and, of, ultraviolet, emissions, from, the, solar, corona, discoveries, included, the, first, observations, of, coronal, mass, ejections, then, called, coronal, transients, and, of, coronal, holes, now, known, to, be, intimately, associated, with, the, solar, wind, in, 1980, the, solar, maximum, mission, probes, were, launched, by, nasa, this, spacecraft, was, designed, to, observe, gamma, rays, x, rays, and, uv, radiation, from, solar, flares, during, a, time, of, high, solar, activity, and, solar, luminosity, just, a, few, months, after, launch, however, an, electronics, failure, caused, the, probe, to, go, into, standby, mode, and, it, spent, the, next, three, years, in, this, inactive, state, in, 1984, space, shuttle, challenger, mission, sts, 41c, retrieved, the, satellite, and, repaired, its, electronics, before, re, releasing, it, into, orbit, the, solar, maximum, mission, subsequently, acquired, thousands, of, images, of, the, solar, corona, before, re, entering, earth, s, atmosphere, in, june, 1989, launched, in, 1991, japan, s, yohkoh, sunbeam, satellite, observed, solar, flares, at, x, ray, wavelengths, mission, data, allowed, scientists, to, identify, several, different, types, of, flares, and, demonstrated, that, the, corona, away, from, regions, of, peak, activity, was, much, more, dynamic, and, active, than, had, previously, been, supposed, yohkoh, observed, an, entire, solar, cycle, but, went, into, standby, mode, when, an, annular, eclipse, in, 2001, caused, it, to, lose, its, lock, on, the, sun, it, was, destroyed, by, atmospheric, re, entry, in, 2005, the, solar, and, heliospheric, observatory, jointly, built, by, the, european, space, agency, and, nasa, was, launched, on, 2, december, 1995, originally, intended, to, serve, a, two, year, mission, soho, remains, in, operation, as, of, 2024, situated, at, the, lagrangian, point, between, earth, and, the, sun, at, which, the, gravitational, pull, from, both, is, equal, soho, has, provided, a, constant, view, of, the, sun, at, many, wavelengths, since, its, launch, besides, its, direct, solar, observation, soho, has, enabled, the, discovery, of, a, large, number, of, comets, mostly, tiny, sungrazing, comets, that, incinerate, as, they, pass, the, sun, all, these, satellites, have, observed, the, sun, from, the, plane, of, the, ecliptic, and, so, have, only, observed, its, equatorial, regions, in, detail, the, ulysses, probe, was, launched, in, 1990, to, study, the, sun, s, polar, regions, it, first, traveled, to, jupiter, to, slingshot, into, an, orbit, that, would, take, it, far, above, the, plane, of, the, ecliptic, once, ulysses, was, in, its, scheduled, orbit, it, began, observing, the, solar, wind, and, magnetic, field, strength, at, high, solar, latitudes, finding, that, the, solar, wind, from, high, latitudes, was, moving, at, about, 750, km, s, which, was, slower, than, expected, and, that, there, were, large, magnetic, waves, emerging, from, high, latitudes, that, scattered, galactic, cosmic, rays, elemental, abundances, in, the, photosphere, are, well, known, from, spectroscopic, studies, but, the, composition, of, the, interior, of, the, sun, is, more, poorly, understood, a, solar, wind, sample, return, mission, genesis, was, designed, to, allow, astronomers, to, directly, measure, the, composition, of, solar, material, the, temperature, of, the, photosphere, is, approximately, 6, 000, k, whereas, the, temperature, of, the, corona, reaches, 1, 000, 000, 2, 000, 000, k, the, high, temperature, of, the, corona, shows, that, it, is, heated, by, something, other, than, direct, heat, conduction, from, the, photosphere, it, is, thought, that, the, energy, necessary, to, heat, the, corona, is, provided, by, turbulent, motion, in, the, convection, zone, below, the, photosphere, and, two, main, mechanisms, have, been, proposed, to, explain, coronal, heating, the, first, is, wave, heating, in, which, sound, gravitational, or, magnetohydrodynamic, waves, are, produced, by, turbulence, in, the, convection, zone, these, waves, travel, upward, and, dissipate, in, the, corona, depositing, their, energy, in, the, ambient, matter, in, the, form, of, heat, the, other, is, magnetic, heating, in, which, magnetic, energy, is, continuously, built, up, by, photospheric, motion, and, released, through, magnetic, reconnection, in, the, form, of, large, solar, flares, and, myriad, similar, but, smaller, events, nanoflares, currently, it, is, unclear, whether, waves, are, an, efficient, heating, mechanism, all, waves, except, alfv, n, waves, have, been, found, to, dissipate, or, refract, before, reaching, the, corona, in, addition, alfv, n, waves, do, not, easily, dissipate, in, the, corona, current, research, focus, has, therefore, shifted, towards, flare, heating, mechanisms, theoretical, models, of, the, sun, s, development, suggest, that, 3, 8, to, 2, 5, billion, years, ago, during, the, archean, eon, the, sun, was, only, about, 75, as, bright, as, it, is, today, such, a, weak, star, would, not, have, been, able, to, sustain, liquid, water, on, earth, s, surface, and, thus, life, should, not, have, been, able, to, develop, however, the, geological, record, demonstrates, that, earth, has, remained, at, a, fairly, constant, temperature, throughout, its, history, and, that, the, young, earth, was, somewhat, warmer, than, it, is, today, one, theory, among, scientists, is, that, the, atmosphere, of, the, young, earth, contained, much, larger, quantities, of, greenhouse, gases, such, as, carbon, dioxide, methane, than, are, present, today, which, trapped, enough, heat, to, compensate, for, the, smaller, amount, of, solar, energy, reaching, it, however, examination, of, archaean, sediments, appears, inconsistent, with, the, hypothesis, of, high, greenhouse, concentrations, instead, the, moderate, temperature, range, may, be, explained, by, a, lower, surface, albedo, brought, about, by, less, continental, area, and, the, lack, of, biologically, induced, cloud, condensation, nuclei, this, would, have, led, to, increased, absorption, of, solar, energy, thereby, compensating, for, the, lower, solar, output, the, brightness, of, the, sun, can, cause, pain, from, looking, at, it, with, the, naked, eye, however, doing, so, for, brief, periods, is, not, hazardous, for, normal, non, dilated, eyes, looking, directly, at, the, sun, sungazing, causes, phosphene, visual, artifacts, and, temporary, partial, blindness, it, also, delivers, about, 4, milliwatts, of, sunlight, to, the, retina, slightly, heating, it, and, potentially, causing, damage, in, eyes, that, cannot, respond, properly, to, the, brightness, viewing, of, the, direct, sun, with, the, naked, eye, can, cause, uv, induced, sunburn, like, lesions, on, the, retina, beginning, after, about, 100, seconds, particularly, under, conditions, where, the, uv, light, from, the, sun, is, intense, and, well, focused, viewing, the, sun, through, light, concentrating, optics, such, as, binoculars, may, result, in, permanent, damage, to, the, retina, without, an, appropriate, filter, that, blocks, uv, and, substantially, dims, the, sunlight, when, using, an, attenuating, filter, to, view, the, sun, the, viewer, is, cautioned, to, use, a, filter, specifically, designed, for, that, use, some, improvised, filters, that, pass, uv, or, ir, rays, can, actually, harm, the, eye, at, high, brightness, levels, brief, glances, at, the, midday, sun, through, an, unfiltered, telescope, can, cause, permanent, damage, during, sunrise, and, sunset, sunlight, is, attenuated, because, of, rayleigh, scattering, and, mie, scattering, from, a, particularly, long, passage, through, earth, s, atmosphere, and, the, sun, is, sometimes, faint, enough, to, be, viewed, comfortably, with, the, naked, eye, or, safely, with, optics, provided, there, is, no, risk, of, bright, sunlight, suddenly, appearing, through, a, break, between, clouds, hazy, conditions, atmospheric, dust, and, high, humidity, contribute, to, this, atmospheric, attenuation, an, optical, phenomenon, known, as, a, green, flash, can, sometimes, be, seen, shortly, after, sunset, or, before, sunrise, the, flash, is, caused, by, light, from, the, sun, just, below, the, horizon, being, bent, usually, through, a, temperature, inversion, towards, the, observer, light, of, shorter, wavelengths, violet, blue, green, is, bent, more, than, that, of, longer, wavelengths, yellow, orange, red, but, the, violet, and, blue, light, is, scattered, more, leaving, light, that, is, perceived, as, green, solar, deities, play, a, major, role, in, many, world, religions, and, mythologies, worship, of, the, sun, was, central, to, civilizations, such, as, the, ancient, egyptians, the, inca, of, south, america, and, the, aztecs, of, what, is, now, mexico, in, religions, such, as, hinduism, the, sun, is, still, considered, a, god, known, as, surya, many, ancient, monuments, were, constructed, with, solar, phenomena, in, mind, for, example, stone, megaliths, accurately, mark, the, summer, or, winter, solstice, for, example, in, nabta, playa, egypt, mnajdra, malta, and, stonehenge, england, newgrange, a, prehistoric, human, built, mount, in, ireland, was, designed, to, detect, the, winter, solstice, the, pyramid, of, el, castillo, at, chich, n, itz, in, mexico, is, designed, to, cast, shadows, in, the, shape, of, serpents, climbing, the, pyramid, at, the, vernal, and, autumnal, equinoxes, the, ancient, sumerians, believed, that, the, sun, was, utu, the, god, of, justice, and, twin, brother, of, inanna, the, queen, of, heaven, who, was, identified,
