a, terrestrial, planet, telluric, planet, or, rocky, planet, is, a, planet, that, is, composed, primarily, of, silicate, rocks, or, metals, within, the, solar, system, the, terrestrial, planets, accepted, by, the, iau, are, the, inner, planets, closest, to, the, sun, mercury, venus, earth, and, mars, among, astronomers, who, use, the, geophysical, definition, of, a, planet, two, or, three, planetary, mass, satellites, earth, s, moon, io, and, sometimes, europa, may, also, be, considered, terrestrial, planets, the, large, rocky, asteroids, pallas, and, vesta, are, sometimes, included, as, well, albeit, rarely, the, terms, terrestrial, planet, and, telluric, planet, are, derived, from, latin, words, for, earth, terra, and, tellus, as, these, planets, are, in, terms, of, structure, earth, like, terrestrial, planets, are, generally, studied, by, geologists, astronomers, and, geophysicists, terrestrial, planets, have, a, solid, planetary, surface, making, them, substantially, different, from, larger, gaseous, planets, which, are, composed, mostly, of, some, combination, of, hydrogen, helium, and, water, existing, in, various, physical, states, all, terrestrial, planets, in, the, solar, system, have, the, same, basic, structure, such, as, a, central, metallic, core, mostly, iron, with, a, surrounding, silicate, mantle, the, large, rocky, asteroid, 4, vesta, has, a, similar, structure, possibly, so, does, the, smaller, one, 21, lutetia, another, rocky, asteroid, 2, pallas, is, about, the, same, size, as, vesta, but, is, significantly, less, dense, it, appears, to, have, never, differentiated, a, core, and, a, mantle, the, earth, s, moon, and, jupiter, s, moon, io, have, similar, structures, to, terrestrial, planets, but, earth, s, moon, has, a, much, smaller, iron, core, another, jovian, moon, europa, has, a, similar, density, but, has, a, significant, ice, layer, on, the, surface, for, this, reason, it, is, sometimes, considered, an, icy, planet, instead, terrestrial, planets, can, have, surface, structures, such, as, canyons, craters, mountains, volcanoes, and, others, depending, on, the, presence, at, any, time, of, an, erosive, liquid, or, tectonic, activity, or, both, terrestrial, planets, have, secondary, atmospheres, generated, by, volcanic, out, gassing, or, from, comet, impact, debris, this, contrasts, with, the, outer, giant, planets, whose, atmospheres, are, primary, primary, atmospheres, were, captured, directly, from, the, original, solar, nebula, the, solar, system, has, four, terrestrial, planets, under, the, dynamical, definition, mercury, venus, earth, and, mars, the, earth, s, moon, as, well, as, jupiter, s, moons, io, and, europa, would, also, count, geophysically, as, well, as, perhaps, the, large, protoplanet, asteroids, pallas, and, vesta, though, those, are, borderline, cases, among, these, bodies, only, the, earth, has, an, active, surface, hydrosphere, europa, is, believed, to, have, an, active, hydrosphere, under, its, ice, layer, during, the, formation, of, the, solar, system, there, were, many, terrestrial, planetesimals, and, proto, planets, but, most, merged, with, or, were, ejected, by, the, four, terrestrial, planets, leaving, only, pallas, and, vesta, to, survive, more, or, less, intact, these, two, were, likely, both, dwarf, planets, in, the, past, but, have, been, battered, out, of, equilibrium, shapes, by, impacts, some, other, protoplanets, began, to, accrete, and, differentiate, but, suffered, catastrophic, collisions, that, left, only, a, metallic, or, rocky, core, like, 16, psyche, or, 8, flora, respectively, many, s, type, and, m, type, asteroids, may, be, such, fragments, the, other, round, bodies, from, the, asteroid, belt, outward, are, geophysically, icy, planets, they, are, similar, to, terrestrial, planets, in, that, they, have, a, solid, surface, but, are, composed, of, ice, and, rock, rather, than, of, rock, and, metal, these, include, the, dwarf, planets, such, as, ceres, pluto, and, eris, which, are, found, today, only, in, the, regions, beyond, the, formation, snow, line, where, water, ice, was, stable, under, direct, sunlight, in, the, early, solar, system, it, also, includes, the, other, round, moons, which, are, ice, rock, e, g, ganymede, callisto, titan, and, triton, or, even, almost, pure, at, least, 99, ice, tethys, and, iapetus, some, of, these, bodies, are, known, to, have, subsurface, hydrospheres, ganymede, callisto, enceladus, and, titan, like, europa, and, it, is, also, possible, for, some, others, e, g, ceres, mimas, dione, miranda, ariel, triton, and, pluto, titan, even, has, surface, bodies, of, liquid, albeit, liquid, methane, rather, than, water, jupiter, s, ganymede, though, icy, does, have, a, metallic, core, like, the, moon, io, europa, and, the, terrestrial, planets, the, name, terran, world, has, been, suggested, to, define, all, solid, worlds, bodies, assuming, a, rounded, shape, without, regard, to, their, composition, it, would, thus, include, both, terrestrial, and, icy, planets, the, uncompressed, density, of, a, terrestrial, planet, is, the, average, density, its, materials, would, have, at, zero, pressure, a, greater, uncompressed, density, indicates, a, greater, metal, content, uncompressed, density, differs, from, the, true, average, density, also, often, called, bulk, density, because, compression, within, planet, cores, increases, their, density, the, average, density, depends, on, planet, size, temperature, distribution, and, material, stiffness, as, well, as, composition, calculations, to, estimate, uncompressed, density, inherently, require, a, model, of, the, planet, s, structure, where, there, have, been, landers, or, multiple, orbiting, spacecraft, these, models, are, constrained, by, seismological, data, and, also, moment, of, inertia, data, derived, from, the, spacecraft, s, orbits, where, such, data, is, not, available, uncertainties, are, inevitably, higher, the, uncompressed, densities, of, the, rounded, terrestrial, bodies, directly, orbiting, the, sun, trend, towards, lower, values, as, the, distance, from, the, sun, increases, consistent, with, the, temperature, gradient, that, would, have, existed, within, the, primordial, solar, nebula, the, galilean, satellites, show, a, similar, trend, going, outwards, from, jupiter, however, no, such, trend, is, observable, for, the, icy, satellites, of, saturn, or, uranus, the, icy, worlds, typically, have, densities, less, than, 2, g, cm, 3, eris, is, significantly, denser, 2, 43, 0, 05, g, cm, 3, and, may, be, mostly, rocky, with, some, surface, ice, like, europa, it, is, unknown, whether, extrasolar, terrestrial, planets, in, general, will, follow, such, a, trend, the, data, in, the, tables, below, are, mostly, taken, from, a, list, of, gravitationally, rounded, objects, of, the, solar, system, and, planetary, mass, moon, all, distances, from, the, sun, are, averages, most, of, the, planets, discovered, outside, the, solar, system, are, giant, planets, because, they, are, more, easily, detectable, but, since, 2005, hundreds, of, potentially, terrestrial, extrasolar, planets, have, also, been, found, with, several, being, confirmed, as, terrestrial, most, of, these, are, super, earths, i, e, planets, with, masses, between, earth, s, and, neptune, s, super, earths, may, be, gas, planets, or, terrestrial, depending, on, their, mass, and, other, parameters, during, the, early, 1990s, the, first, extrasolar, planets, were, discovered, orbiting, the, pulsar, psr, b1257, 12, with, masses, of, 0, 02, 4, 3, and, 3, 9, times, that, of, earth, by, pulsar, timing, when, 51, pegasi, b, the, first, planet, found, around, a, star, still, undergoing, fusion, was, discovered, many, astronomers, assumed, it, to, be, a, gigantic, terrestrial, because, it, was, assumed, no, gas, giant, could, exist, as, close, to, its, star, 0, 052, au, as, 51, pegasi, b, did, it, was, later, found, to, be, a, gas, giant, in, 2005, the, first, planets, orbiting, a, main, sequence, star, and, which, showed, signs, of, being, terrestrial, planets, were, found, gliese, 876, d, and, ogle, 2005, blg, 390lb, gliese, 876, d, orbits, the, red, dwarf, gliese, 876, 15, light, years, from, earth, and, has, a, mass, seven, to, nine, times, that, of, earth, and, an, orbital, period, of, just, two, earth, days, ogle, 2005, blg, 390lb, has, about, 5, 5, times, the, mass, of, earth, and, orbits, a, star, about, 21, 000, light, years, away, in, the, constellation, scorpius, from, 2007, to, 2010, three, possibly, four, potential, terrestrial, planets, were, found, orbiting, within, the, gliese, 581, planetary, system, the, smallest, gliese, 581e, is, only, about, 1, 9, earth, masses, but, orbits, very, close, to, the, star, two, others, gliese, 581c, and, the, disputed, gliese, 581d, are, more, massive, super, earths, orbiting, in, or, close, to, the, habitable, zone, of, the, star, so, they, could, potentially, be, habitable, with, earth, like, temperatures, another, possibly, terrestrial, planet, hd, 85512, b, was, discovered, in, 2011, it, has, at, least, 3, 6, times, the, mass, of, earth, the, radius, and, composition, of, all, these, planets, are, unknown, the, first, confirmed, terrestrial, exoplanet, kepler, 10b, was, found, in, 2011, by, the, kepler, space, telescope, specifically, designed, to, discover, earth, size, planets, around, other, stars, using, the, transit, method, in, the, same, year, the, kepler, space, telescope, mission, team, released, a, list, of, 1235, extrasolar, planet, candidates, including, six, that, are, earth, size, or, super, earth, size, i, e, they, have, a, radius, less, than, twice, that, of, the, earth, and, in, the, habitable, zone, of, their, star, since, then, kepler, has, discovered, hundreds, of, planets, ranging, from, moon, sized, to, super, earths, with, many, more, candidates, in, this, size, range, see, image, in, 2016, statistical, modeling, of, the, relationship, between, a, planet, s, mass, and, radius, using, a, broken, power, law, appeared, to, suggest, that, the, transition, point, between, rocky, terrestrial, worlds, and, mini, neptunes, without, a, defined, surface, was, in, fact, very, close, to, earth, and, venus, s, suggesting, that, rocky, worlds, much, larger, than, our, own, are, in, fact, quite, rare, this, resulted, in, some, advocating, for, the, retirement, of, the, term, super, earth, as, being, scientifically, misleading, since, 2016, the, catalog, of, known, exoplanets, has, increased, significantly, and, there, have, been, several, published, refinements, of, the, mass, radius, model, as, of, 2024, the, expected, transition, point, between, rocky, and, intermediate, mass, planets, sits, at, roughly, 4, 4, earth, masses, and, roughly, 1, 6, earth, radii, in, september, 2020, astronomers, using, microlensing, techniques, reported, the, detection, for, the, first, time, of, an, earth, mass, rogue, planet, named, ogle, 2016, blg, 1928, unbounded, by, any, star, and, free, floating, in, the, milky, way, galaxy, the, following, exoplanets, have, a, density, of, at, least, 5, g, cm, 3, and, a, mass, below, neptune, s, and, are, thus, very, likely, terrestrial, kepler, 10b, kepler, 20b, kepler, 36b, kepler, 48d, kepler, 68c, kepler, 78b, kepler, 89b, kepler, 93b, kepler, 97b, kepler, 99b, kepler, 100b, kepler, 101c, kepler, 102b, kepler, 102d, kepler, 113b, kepler, 131b, kepler, 131c, kepler, 138c, kepler, 406b, kepler, 406c, kepler, 409b, in, 2013, astronomers, reported, based, on, kepler, space, mission, data, that, there, could, be, as, many, as, 40, billion, earth, and, super, earth, sized, planets, orbiting, in, the, habitable, zones, of, sun, like, stars, and, red, dwarfs, within, the, milky, way, eleven, billion, of, these, estimated, planets, may, be, orbiting, sun, like, stars, the, nearest, such, planet, may, be, 12, light, years, away, according, to, the, scientists, however, this, does, not, give, estimates, for, the, number, of, extrasolar, terrestrial, planets, because, there, are, planets, as, small, as, earth, that, have, been, shown, to, be, gas, planets, see, kepler, 138d, estimates, show, that, about, 80, of, potentially, habitable, worlds, are, covered, by, land, and, about, 20, are, ocean, planets, planets, with, rations, more, like, those, of, earth, which, was, 30, land, and, 70, ocean, only, make, up, 1, of, these, worlds, several, possible, classifications, for, solid, planets, have, been, proposed, solar, system, local, interstellar, cloud, local, bubble, gould, belt, orion, arm, milky, way, milky, way, subgroup, local, group, local, sheet, virgo, supercluster, laniakea, supercluster, local, hole, observable, universe, universe, each, arrow, may, be, read, as, within, or, part, of
