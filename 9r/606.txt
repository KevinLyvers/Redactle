slate, is, a, fine, grained, foliated, homogeneous, metamorphic, rock, derived, from, an, original, shale, type, sedimentary, rock, composed, of, clay, or, volcanic, ash, through, low, grade, regional, metamorphism, it, is, the, finest, grained, foliated, metamorphic, rock, foliation, may, not, correspond, to, the, original, sedimentary, layering, but, instead, is, in, planes, perpendicular, to, the, direction, of, metamorphic, compression, the, foliation, in, slate, called, slaty, cleavage, is, caused, by, strong, compression, in, which, fine, grained, clay, forms, flakes, to, regrow, in, planes, perpendicular, to, the, compression, when, expertly, cut, by, striking, parallel, to, the, foliation, with, a, specialized, tool, in, the, quarry, many, slates, display, a, property, called, fissility, forming, smooth, flat, sheets, of, stone, which, have, long, been, used, for, roofing, floor, tiles, and, other, purposes, slate, is, frequently, grey, in, color, especially, when, seen, en, masse, covering, roofs, however, slate, occurs, in, a, variety, of, colors, even, from, a, single, locality, for, example, slate, from, north, wales, can, be, found, in, many, shades, of, grey, from, pale, to, dark, and, may, also, be, purple, green, or, cyan, slate, is, not, to, be, confused, with, shale, from, which, it, may, be, formed, or, schist, the, word, slate, is, also, used, for, certain, types, of, object, made, from, slate, rock, it, may, mean, a, single, roofing, tile, made, of, slate, or, a, writing, slate, which, was, traditionally, a, small, smooth, piece, of, the, rock, often, framed, in, wood, used, with, chalk, as, a, notepad, or, notice, board, and, especially, for, recording, charges, in, pubs, and, inns, the, phrases, clean, slate, and, blank, slate, come, from, this, usage, slate, is, a, fine, grained, metamorphic, rock, that, shows, no, obvious, compositional, layering, but, can, easily, be, split, into, thin, slabs, and, plates, it, is, usually, formed, by, low, grade, regional, metamorphism, of, mudrock, this, mild, degree, of, metamorphism, produces, a, rock, in, which, the, individual, mineral, crystals, remain, microscopic, in, size, producing, a, characteristic, slaty, cleavage, in, which, fresh, cleavage, surfaces, appear, dull, this, is, in, contrast, to, the, silky, cleaved, surfaces, of, phyllite, which, is, the, next, higher, grade, of, metamorphic, rock, derived, from, mudstone, the, direction, of, cleavage, is, independent, of, any, sedimentary, structures, in, the, original, mudrock, reflecting, instead, the, direction, of, regional, compression, slaty, cleavage, is, continuous, meaning, that, the, individual, cleavage, planes, are, too, closely, spaced, to, be, discernible, in, hand, samples, the, texture, of, the, slate, is, totally, dominated, by, these, pervasive, cleavage, planes, under, a, microscope, the, slate, is, found, to, consist, of, very, thin, lenses, of, quartz, and, feldspar, qf, domains, separated, by, layers, of, mica, m, domains, these, are, typically, less, than, 100, m, micron, thick, because, slate, was, formed, in, low, heat, and, pressure, compared, to, most, other, metamorphic, rocks, some, fossils, can, be, found, in, slate, sometimes, even, microscopic, remains, of, delicate, organisms, can, be, found, in, slate, the, process, of, conversion, of, mudrock, to, slate, involves, a, loss, of, up, to, 50, of, the, volume, of, the, mudrock, as, it, is, compacted, grains, of, platy, minerals, such, as, clay, minerals, are, rotated, to, form, parallel, layers, perpendicular, to, the, direction, of, compaction, which, begin, to, impart, cleavage, to, the, rock, slaty, cleavage, is, fully, developed, as, the, clay, minerals, begin, to, be, converted, to, chlorite, and, mica, organic, carbon, in, the, rock, is, converted, to, graphite, slate, is, mainly, composed, of, the, minerals, quartz, illite, and, chlorite, which, account, for, up, to, 95, of, its, composition, the, most, important, accessory, minerals, are, iron, oxides, such, as, hematite, and, magnetite, iron, sulfides, such, as, pyrite, and, carbonate, minerals, feldspar, may, be, present, as, albite, or, less, commonly, orthoclase, occasionally, as, in, the, purple, slates, of, north, wales, ferrous, iron, ii, reduction, spheres, form, around, iron, nuclei, leaving, a, light, green, spotted, texture, these, spheres, are, sometimes, deformed, by, a, subsequent, applied, stress, field, into, ovoids, which, appear, as, ellipses, when, viewed, on, a, cleavage, plane, of, the, specimen, however, some, evidence, shows, that, reduced, spots, may, also, form, after, deformation, and, acquire, an, elliptical, shape, from, preferential, infiltration, along, the, cleavage, direction, so, caution, is, required, in, using, reduction, ellipsoids, to, estimate, deformation, before, the, mid, 19th, century, the, terms, slate, shale, and, schist, were, not, sharply, distinguished, in, the, context, of, underground, coal, mining, in, the, united, states, the, term, slate, was, commonly, used, to, refer, to, shale, well, into, the, 20th, century, for, example, roof, slate, referred, to, shale, above, a, coal, seam, and, draw, slate, referred, to, shale, that, fell, from, the, mine, roof, as, the, coal, was, removed, the, british, geological, survey, recommends, that, the, term, slate, be, used, in, scientific, writings, only, when, very, little, else, is, known, about, the, rock, that, would, allow, a, more, definite, classification, for, example, if, the, characteristics, of, the, rock, show, definitely, that, it, was, formed, by, metamorphosis, of, shale, it, should, be, described, in, scientific, writings, as, a, metashale, if, its, origin, is, uncertain, but, the, rock, is, known, to, be, rich, in, mica, it, should, be, described, as, a, pelite, slate, can, be, made, into, roofing, slate, a, type, of, roof, tile, which, are, installed, by, a, slater, slate, has, two, lines, of, breakability, cleavage, and, grain, which, make, it, possible, to, split, the, stone, into, thin, sheets, when, broken, slate, retains, a, natural, appearance, while, remaining, relatively, flat, and, easy, to, stack, a, series, of, slate, booms, occurred, in, europe, from, the, 1870s, until, the, first, world, war, following, improvements, in, railway, road, and, waterway, transportation, systems, slate, is, particularly, suitable, as, a, roofing, material, as, it, has, an, extremely, low, water, absorption, index, of, less, than, 0, 4, making, the, material, resistant, to, frost, damage, natural, slate, which, requires, only, minimal, processing, has, an, embodied, energy, that, compares, favorably, with, other, roofing, materials, natural, slate, is, used, by, building, professionals, as, a, result, of, its, beauty, and, durability, slate, is, incredibly, durable, and, can, last, several, hundred, years, often, with, little, or, no, maintenance, natural, slate, is, also, fire, resistant, and, energy, efficient, slate, roof, tiles, are, usually, fixed, fastened, either, with, nails, or, with, hooks, as, is, common, with, spanish, slate, in, the, uk, fixing, is, typically, with, double, nails, onto, timber, battens, england, and, wales, or, nailed, directly, onto, timber, sarking, boards, scotland, and, northern, ireland, nails, were, traditionally, of, copper, although, there, are, modern, alloy, and, stainless, steel, alternatives, both, these, methods, if, used, properly, provide, a, long, lasting, weathertight, roof, with, a, lifespan, of, around, 60, 125, years, some, mainland, european, slate, suppliers, suggest, that, using, hook, fixing, means, that, the, metal, hooks, are, however, visible, and, may, be, unsuitable, for, historic, properties, slate, tiles, are, often, used, for, interior, and, exterior, flooring, stairs, walkways, and, wall, cladding, tiles, are, installed, and, set, on, mortar, and, grouted, along, the, edges, chemical, sealants, are, often, used, on, tiles, to, improve, durability, and, appearance, increase, stain, resistance, reduce, efflorescence, and, increase, or, reduce, surface, smoothness, tiles, are, often, sold, gauged, meaning, that, the, back, surface, is, ground, for, ease, of, installation, slate, flooring, can, be, slippery, when, used, in, external, locations, subject, to, rain, slate, tiles, were, used, in, 19th, century, uk, building, construction, apart, from, roofs, and, in, slate, quarrying, areas, such, as, blaenau, ffestiniog, and, bethesda, wales, there, are, still, many, buildings, wholly, constructed, of, slate, slates, can, also, be, set, into, walls, to, provide, a, rudimentary, damp, proof, membrane, small, offcuts, are, used, as, shims, to, level, floor, joists, in, areas, where, slate, is, plentiful, it, is, also, used, in, pieces, of, various, sizes, for, building, walls, and, hedges, sometimes, combined, with, other, kinds, of, stone, because, it, is, a, good, electrical, insulator, and, fireproof, it, was, used, to, construct, early, 20th, century, electric, switchboards, and, relay, controls, for, large, electric, motors, because, of, its, thermal, stability, and, chemical, inertness, slate, has, been, used, for, laboratory, bench, tops, and, for, billiard, table, tops, slate, was, used, by, earlier, cultures, as, whetstone, to, hone, knives, but, whetstones, are, nowadays, more, typically, made, of, quartz, in, 18th, and, 19th, century, schools, slate, was, extensively, used, for, blackboards, and, individual, writing, slates, for, which, slate, or, chalk, pencils, were, used, in, modern, homes, slate, is, often, used, as, table, coasters, in, areas, where, it, is, available, high, quality, slate, is, used, for, tombstones, and, commemorative, tablets, in, some, cases, slate, was, used, by, the, ancient, maya, civilization, to, fashion, stelae, slate, was, the, traditional, material, of, choice, for, black, go, stones, in, japan, alongside, clamshell, for, white, stones, it, is, now, considered, to, be, a, luxury, pennsylvania, slate, is, widely, used, in, the, manufacture, of, turkey, calls, used, for, hunting, turkeys, the, tones, produced, from, the, slate, when, scratched, with, various, species, of, wood, striker, imitates, almost, exactly, the, calls, of, all, four, species, of, wild, turkey, in, north, america, eastern, rio, grande, osceola, and, merriam, s, slate, is, found, in, the, arctic, and, was, used, by, inuit, to, make, the, blades, for, ulus, china, has, vast, slate, deposits, in, recent, years, its, export, of, finished, and, unfinished, slate, has, increased, deposits, of, slate, exist, throughout, australia, with, large, reserves, quarried, in, the, adelaide, hills, in, willunga, kanmantoo, and, the, mid, north, at, mintaro, and, spalding, slate, is, abundant, in, brazil, the, world, s, second, largest, producer, of, slate, around, papagaios, in, minas, gerais, which, extracts, 95, percent, of, brazil, s, slate, however, not, all, slate, products, from, brazil, are, entitled, to, bear, the, ce, mark, most, slate, in, europe, today, comes, from, spain, the, world, s, largest, producer, and, exporter, of, natural, slate, and, 90, percent, of, europe, s, natural, slate, used, for, roofing, originates, from, the, slate, industry, there, lesser, slate, producing, regions, in, present, day, europe, include, wales, with, unesco, landscape, status, and, a, museum, at, llanberis, cornwall, famously, the, village, of, delabole, cumbria, see, burlington, slate, quarries, honister, slate, mine, and, skiddaw, slate, and, formerly, in, the, west, highlands, of, scotland, around, ballachulish, and, the, slate, islands, in, the, united, kingdom, parts, of, france, anjou, loire, valley, ardennes, brittany, savoie, and, belgium, ardennes, liguria, in, northern, italy, especially, between, the, town, of, lavagna, whose, name, is, inherited, as, the, term, for, chalkboard, in, italian, and, fontanabuona, valley, portugal, especially, around, valongo, in, the, north, of, the, country, germany, s, moselle, river, region, hunsr, ck, with, a, former, mine, open, as, a, museum, at, fell, eifel, westerwald, thuringia, and, north, bavaria, and, alta, norway, actually, schist, not, a, true, slate, some, of, the, slate, from, wales, and, cumbria, is, colored, slate, non, blue, purple, and, formerly, green, in, wales, and, green, in, cumbria, in, north, america, slate, is, produced, in, newfoundland, eastern, pennsylvania, buckingham, county, virginia, and, the, slate, valley, region, in, vermont, and, new, york, where, colored, slate, is, mined, in, the, granville, new, york, area, a, major, slating, operation, existed, in, monson, maine, during, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, where, the, slate, is, usually, dark, purple, to, blackish, and, many, local, structures, are, roofed, with, slate, tiles, the, roof, of, st, patrick, s, cathedral, in, new, york, city, and, the, headstone, of, john, f, kennedy, s, gravesite, in, arlington, national,
