a, blizzard, is, a, severe, snowstorm, characterized, by, strong, sustained, winds, and, low, visibility, lasting, for, a, prolonged, period, of, time, typically, at, least, three, or, four, hours, a, ground, blizzard, is, a, weather, condition, where, snow, is, not, falling, but, loose, snow, on, the, ground, is, lifted, and, blown, by, strong, winds, blizzards, can, have, an, immense, size, and, usually, stretch, to, hundreds, or, thousands, of, kilometres, in, the, united, states, the, national, weather, service, defines, a, blizzard, as, a, severe, snow, storm, characterized, by, strong, winds, causing, blowing, snow, that, results, in, low, visibilities, the, difference, between, a, blizzard, and, a, snowstorm, is, the, strength, of, the, wind, not, the, amount, of, snow, to, be, a, blizzard, a, snow, storm, must, have, sustained, winds, or, frequent, gusts, that, are, greater, than, or, equal, to, 56, km, h, 35, mph, with, blowing, or, drifting, snow, which, reduces, visibility, to, 400, m, or, 0, 25, mi, or, less, and, must, last, for, a, prolonged, period, of, time, typically, three, hours, or, more, environment, canada, defines, a, blizzard, as, a, storm, with, wind, speeds, exceeding, 40, km, h, 25, mph, accompanied, by, visibility, of, 400, metres, 0, 25, mi, or, less, resulting, from, snowfall, blowing, snow, or, a, combination, of, the, two, these, conditions, must, persist, for, a, period, of, at, least, four, hours, for, the, storm, to, be, classified, as, a, blizzard, except, north, of, the, arctic, tree, line, where, that, threshold, is, raised, to, six, hours, the, australia, bureau, of, meteorology, describes, a, blizzard, as, violent, and, very, cold, wind, which, is, laden, with, snow, some, part, at, least, of, which, has, been, raised, from, snow, covered, ground, while, severe, cold, and, large, amounts, of, drifting, snow, may, accompany, blizzards, they, are, not, required, blizzards, can, bring, whiteout, conditions, and, can, paralyze, regions, for, days, at, a, time, particularly, where, snowfall, is, unusual, or, rare, a, severe, blizzard, has, winds, over, 72, km, h, 45, mph, near, zero, visibility, and, temperatures, of, 12, c, 10, f, or, lower, in, antarctica, blizzards, are, associated, with, winds, spilling, over, the, edge, of, the, ice, plateau, at, an, average, velocity, of, 160, km, h, 99, mph, ground, blizzard, refers, to, a, weather, condition, where, loose, snow, or, ice, on, the, ground, is, lifted, and, blown, by, strong, winds, the, primary, difference, between, a, ground, blizzard, as, opposed, to, a, regular, blizzard, is, that, in, a, ground, blizzard, no, precipitation, is, produced, at, the, time, but, rather, all, the, precipitation, is, already, present, in, the, form, of, snow, or, ice, at, the, surface, the, oxford, english, dictionary, concludes, the, term, blizzard, is, likely, onomatopoeic, derived, from, the, same, sense, as, blow, blast, blister, and, bluster, the, first, recorded, use, of, it, for, weather, dates, to, 1829, when, it, was, defined, as, a, violent, blow, it, achieved, its, modern, definition, by, 1859, when, it, was, in, use, in, the, western, united, states, the, term, became, common, in, the, press, during, the, harsh, winter, of, 1880, 81, in, the, united, states, storm, systems, powerful, enough, to, cause, blizzards, usually, form, when, the, jet, stream, dips, far, to, the, south, allowing, cold, dry, polar, air, from, the, north, to, clash, with, warm, humid, air, moving, up, from, the, south, when, cold, moist, air, from, the, pacific, ocean, moves, eastward, to, the, rocky, mountains, and, the, great, plains, and, warmer, moist, air, moves, north, from, the, gulf, of, mexico, all, that, is, needed, is, a, movement, of, cold, polar, air, moving, south, to, form, potential, blizzard, conditions, that, may, extend, from, the, texas, panhandle, to, the, great, lakes, and, midwest, a, blizzard, also, may, be, formed, when, a, cold, front, and, warm, front, mix, together, and, a, blizzard, forms, at, the, border, line, another, storm, system, occurs, when, a, cold, core, low, over, the, hudson, bay, area, in, canada, is, displaced, southward, over, southeastern, canada, the, great, lakes, and, new, england, when, the, rapidly, moving, cold, front, collides, with, warmer, air, coming, north, from, the, gulf, of, mexico, strong, surface, winds, significant, cold, air, advection, and, extensive, wintry, precipitation, occur, low, pressure, systems, moving, out, of, the, rocky, mountains, onto, the, great, plains, a, broad, expanse, of, flat, land, much, of, it, covered, in, prairie, steppe, and, grassland, can, cause, thunderstorms, and, rain, to, the, south, and, heavy, snows, and, strong, winds, to, the, north, with, few, trees, or, other, obstructions, to, reduce, wind, and, blowing, this, part, of, the, country, is, particularly, vulnerable, to, blizzards, with, very, low, temperatures, and, whiteout, conditions, in, a, true, whiteout, there, is, no, visible, horizon, people, can, become, lost, in, their, own, front, yards, when, the, door, is, only, 3, m, 10, ft, away,

occurs, off, the, new, england, and, atlantic, canada, coastlines, it, gets, its, name, from, the, direction, the, wind, is, coming, from, the, usage, of, the, term, in, north, america, comes, from, the, wind, associated, with, many, different, types, of, storms, some, of, which, can, form, in, the, north, atlantic, ocean, and, some, of, which, form, as, far, south, as, the, gulf, of, mexico, the, term, is, most, often, used, in, the, coastal, areas, of, new, england, and, atlantic, canada, this, type, of, storm, has, characteristics, similar, to, a, hurricane, more, specifically, it, describes, a, low, pressure, area, whose, center, of, rotation, is, just, off, the, coast, and, whose, leading, winds, in, the, left, forward, quadrant, rotate, onto, land, from, the, northeast, high,

history, it, dropped, 100, 130, cm, 40, 50, in, of, snow, and, had, sustained, winds, of, more, than, 45, miles, per, hour, 72, km, h, that, produced, snowdrifts, in, excess, of, 50, feet, 15, m, railroads, were, shut, down, and, people, were, confined, to, their, houses, for, up, to, a, week, it, killed, 400, people, mostly, in, new, york, the, 1972, iran, blizzard, which, caused, 4, 000, reported, deaths, was, the, deadliest, blizzard, in, recorded, history, dropping, as, much, as, 26, feet, 7, 9, m, of, snow, it, completely, covered, 200, villages, after, a, snowfall, lasting, nearly, a, week, an, area, the, size, of, wisconsin, was, entirely, buried, in, snow, the, 2008, afghanistan, blizzard, was, a, fierce, blizzard, that, struck, afghanistan, on, 10, january, 2008, temperatures, fell, to, a, low, of, 30, c, 22, f, with, up, to, 180, centimetres, 71, in, of, snow, in, the, more, mountainous, regions, killing, at, least, 926, people, it, was, the, third, deadliest, blizzard, in, history, the, weather, also, claimed, more, than, 100, 000, sheep, and, goats, and, nearly, 315, 000, cattle, died, the, winter, of, 1880, 1881, is, widely, considered, the, most, severe, winter, ever, known, in, many, parts, of, the, united, states, the, initial, blizzard, in, october, 1880, brought, snowfalls, so, deep, that, two, story, homes, experienced, accumulations, as, opposed, to, drifts, up, to, their, second, floor, windows, no, one, was, prepared, for, deep, snow, so, early, in, the, winter, farmers, from, north, dakota, to, virginia, were, caught, flat, with, fields, unharvested, what, grain, that, had, been, harvested, unmilled, and, their, suddenly, all, important, winter, stocks, of, wood, fuel, only, partially, collected, by, january, train, service, was, almost, entirely, suspended, from, the, region, railroads, hired, scores, of, men, to, dig, out, the, tracks, but, as, soon, as, they, had, finished, shoveling, a, stretch, of, line, a, new, storm, arrived, burying, it, again, there, were, no, winter, thaws, and, on, february, 2, 1881, a, second, massive, blizzard, struck, that, lasted, for, nine, days, in, towns, the, streets, were, filled, with, solid, drifts, to, the, tops, of, the, buildings, and, tunneling, was, necessary, to, move, about, homes, and, barns, were, completely, covered, compelling, farmers, to, construct, fragile, tunnels, in, order, to, feed, their, stock, when, the, snow, finally, melted, in, late, spring, of, 1881, huge, sections, of, the, plains, experienced, flooding, massive, ice, jams, clogged, the, missouri, river, and, when, they, broke, the, downstream, areas, were, inundated, most, of, the, town, of, yankton, in, what, is, now, south, dakota, was, washed, away, when, the, river, overflowed, its, banks, after, the, thaw, many, children, and, their, parents, learned, of, the, snow, winter, through, the, children, s, book, the, long, winter, by, laura, ingalls, wilder, in, which, the, author, tells, of, her, family, s, efforts, to, survive, the, snow, arrived, in, october, 1880, and, blizzard, followed, blizzard, throughout, the, winter, and, into, march, 1881, leaving, many, areas, snowbound, throughout, the, entire, winter, accurate, details, in, wilder, s, novel, include, the, blizzards, frequency, and, the, deep, cold, the, chicago, and, north, western, railway, stopping, trains, until, the, spring, thaw, because, the, snow, made, the, tracks, impassable, the, near, starvation, of, the, townspeople, and, the, courage, of, her, future, husband, almanzo, and, another, man, cap, garland, who, ventured, out, on, the, open, prairie, in, search, of, a, cache, of, wheat, that, no, one, was, even, sure, existed, the, storm, of, the, century, also, known, as, the, great, blizzard, of, 1993, was, a, large, cyclonic, storm, that, formed, over, the, gulf, of, mexico, on, march, 12, 1993, and, dissipated, in, the, north, atlantic, ocean, on, march, 15, it, is, unique, for, its, intensity, massive, size, and, wide, reaching, effect, at, its, height, the, storm, stretched, from, canada, towards, central, america, but, its, main, impact, was, on, the, united, states, and, cuba, the, cyclone, moved, through, the, gulf, of, mexico, and, then, through, the, eastern, united, states, before, moving, into, canada, areas, as, far, south, as, northern, alabama, and, georgia, received, a, dusting, of, snow, and, areas, such, as, birmingham, alabama, received, up, to, 12, in, 30, cm, with, hurricane, force, wind, gusts, and, record, low, barometric, pressures, between, louisiana, and, cuba, hurricane, force, winds, produced, high, storm, surges, across, northwestern, florida, which, along, with, scattered, tornadoes, killed, dozens, of, people, in, the, united, states, the, storm, was, responsible, for, the, loss, of, electric, power, to, over, 10, million, customers, it, is, purported, to, have, been, directly, experienced, by, nearly, 40, percent, of, the, country, s, population, at, that, time, a, total, of, 310, people, including, 10, from, cuba, perished, during, this, storm, the, storm, cost, 6, to, 10,
