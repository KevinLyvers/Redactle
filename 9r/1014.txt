in, physics, and, materials, science, plasticity, also, known, as, plastic, deformation, is, the, ability, of, a, solid, material, to, undergo, permanent, deformation, a, non, reversible, change, of, shape, in, response, to, applied, forces, for, example, a, solid, piece, of, metal, being, bent, or, pounded, into, a, new, shape, displays, plasticity, as, permanent, changes, occur, within, the, material, itself, in, engineering, the, transition, from, elastic, behavior, to, plastic, behavior, is, known, as, yielding, plastic, deformation, is, observed, in, most, materials, particularly, metals, soils, rocks, concrete, and, foams, however, the, physical, mechanisms, that, cause, plastic, deformation, can, vary, widely, at, a, crystalline, scale, plasticity, in, metals, is, usually, a, consequence, of, dislocations, such, defects, are, relatively, rare, in, most, crystalline, materials, but, are, numerous, in, some, and, part, of, their, crystal, structure, in, such, cases, plastic, crystallinity, can, result, in, brittle, materials, such, as, rock, concrete, and, bone, plasticity, is, caused, predominantly, by, slip, at, microcracks, in, cellular, materials, such, as, liquid, foams, or, biological, tissues, plasticity, is, mainly, a, consequence, of, bubble, or, cell, rearrangements, notably, t1, processes, for, many, ductile, metals, tensile, loading, applied, to, a, sample, will, cause, it, to, behave, in, an, elastic, manner, each, increment, of, load, is, accompanied, by, a, proportional, increment, in, extension, when, the, load, is, removed, the, piece, returns, to, its, original, size, however, once, the, load, exceeds, a, threshold, the, yield, strength, the, extension, increases, more, rapidly, than, in, the, elastic, region, now, when, the, load, is, removed, some, degree, of, extension, will, remain, elastic, deformation, however, is, an, approximation, and, its, quality, depends, on, the, time, frame, considered, and, loading, speed, if, as, indicated, in, the, graph, opposite, the, deformation, includes, elastic, deformation, it, is, also, often, referred, to, as, elasto, plastic, deformation, or, elastic, plastic, deformation, perfect, plasticity, is, a, property, of, materials, to, undergo, irreversible, deformation, without, any, increase, in, stresses, or, loads, plastic, materials, that, have, been, hardened, by, prior, deformation, such, as, cold, forming, may, need, increasingly, higher, stresses, to, deform, further, generally, plastic, deformation, is, also, dependent, on, the, deformation, speed, i, e, higher, stresses, usually, have, to, be, applied, to, increase, the, rate, of, deformation, such, materials, are, said, to, deform, visco, plastically, the, plasticity, of, a, material, is, directly, proportional, to, the, ductility, and, malleability, of, the, material, plasticity, in, a, crystal, of, pure, metal, is, primarily, caused, by, two, modes, of, deformation, in, the, crystal, lattice, slip, and, twinning, slip, is, a, shear, deformation, which, moves, the, atoms, through, many, interatomic, distances, relative, to, their, initial, positions, twinning, is, the, plastic, deformation, which, takes, place, along, two, planes, due, to, a, set, of, forces, applied, to, a, given, metal, piece, most, metals, show, more, plasticity, when, hot, than, when, cold, lead, shows, sufficient, plasticity, at, room, temperature, while, cast, iron, does, not, possess, sufficient, plasticity, for, any, forging, operation, even, when, hot, this, property, is, of, importance, in, forming, shaping, and, extruding, operations, on, metals, most, metals, are, rendered, plastic, by, heating, and, hence, shaped, hot, crystalline, materials, contain, uniform, planes, of, atoms, organized, with, long, range, order, planes, may, slip, past, each, other, along, their, close, packed, directions, as, is, shown, on, the, slip, systems, page, the, result, is, a, permanent, change, of, shape, within, the, crystal, and, plastic, deformation, the, presence, of, dislocations, increases, the, likelihood, of, planes, on, the, nanoscale, the, primary, plastic, deformation, in, simple, face, centered, cubic, metals, is, reversible, as, long, as, there, is, no, material, transport, in, form, of, cross, slip, shape, memory, alloys, such, as, nitinol, wire, also, exhibit, a, reversible, form, of, plasticity, which, is, more, properly, called, pseudoelasticity, the, presence, of, other, defects, within, a, crystal, may, entangle, dislocations, or, otherwise, prevent, them, from, gliding, when, this, happens, plasticity, is, localized, to, particular, regions, in, the, material, for, crystals, these, regions, of, localized, plasticity, are, called, shear, bands, microplasticity, is, a, local, phenomenon, in, metals, it, occurs, for, stress, values, where, the, metal, is, globally, in, the, elastic, domain, while, some, local, areas, are, in, the, plastic, domain, in, amorphous, materials, the, discussion, of, dislocations, is, inapplicable, since, the, entire, material, lacks, long, range, order, these, materials, can, still, undergo, plastic, deformation, since, amorphous, materials, like, polymers, are, not, well, ordered, they, contain, a, large, amount, of, free, volume, or, wasted, space, pulling, these, materials, in, tension, opens, up, these, regions, and, can, give, materials, a, hazy, appearance, this, haziness, is, the, result, of, crazing, where, fibrils, are, formed, within, the, material, in, regions, of, high, hydrostatic, stress, the, material, may, go, from, an, ordered, appearance, to, a, crazy, pattern, of, strain, and, stretch, marks, these, materials, plastically, deform, when, the, bending, moment, exceeds, the, fully, plastic, moment, this, applies, to, open, cell, foams, where, the, bending, moment, is, exerted, on, the, cell, walls, the, foams, can, be, made, of, any, material, with, a, plastic, yield, point, which, includes, rigid, polymers, and, metals, this, method, of, modeling, the, foam, as, beams, is, only, valid, if, the, ratio, of, the, density, of, the, foam, to, the, density, of, the, matter, is, less, than, 0, 3, this, is, because, beams, yield, axially, instead, of, bending, in, closed, cell, foams, the, yield, strength, is, increased, if, the, material, is, under, tension, because, of, the, membrane, that, spans, the, face, of, the, cells, soils, particularly, clays, display, a, significant, amount, of, inelasticity, under, load, the, causes, of, plasticity, in, soils, can, be, quite, complex, and, are, strongly, dependent, on, the, microstructure, chemical, composition, and, water, content, plastic, behavior, in, soils, is, caused, primarily, by, the, rearrangement, of, clusters, of, adjacent, grains, inelastic, deformations, of, rocks, and, concrete, are, primarily, caused, by, the, formation, of, microcracks, and, sliding, motions, relative, to, these, cracks, at, high, temperatures, and, pressures, plastic, behavior, can, also, be, affected, by, the, motion, of, dislocations, in, individual, grains, in, the, microstructure, time, independent, plastic, flow, in, both, single, crystals, and, polycrystals, is, defined, by, a, critical, maximum, resolved, shear, stress, crss, initiating, dislocation, migration, along, parallel, slip, planes, of, a, single, slip, system, thereby, defining, the, transition, from, elastic, to, plastic, deformation, behavior, in, crystalline, materials, the, critical, resolved, shear, stress, for, single, crystals, is, defined, by, schmid, s, law, crss, y, m, where, y, is, the, yield, strength, of, the, single, crystal, and, m, is, the, schmid, factor, the, schmid, factor, comprises, two, variables, and, defining, the, angle, between, the, slip, plane, direction, and, the, tensile, force, applied, and, the, angle, between, the, slip, plane, normal, and, the, tensile, force, applied, respectively, notably, because, m, 1, y, crss, there, are, three, characteristic, regions, of, the, critical, resolved, shear, stress, as, a, function, of, temperature, in, the, low, temperature, region, 1, t, 0, 25, t, m, the, strain, rate, must, be, high, to, achieve, high, crss, which, is, required, to, initiate, dislocation, glide, and, equivalently, plastic, flow, in, region, 1, the, critical, resolved, shear, stress, has, two, components, athermal, a, and, thermal, shear, stresses, arising, from, the, stress, required, to, move, dislocations, in, the, presence, of, other, dislocations, and, the, resistance, of, point, defect, obstacles, to, dislocation, migration, respectively, at, t, t, the, moderate, temperature, region, 2, 0, 25, t, m, t, 0, 7, t, m, is, defined, where, the, thermal, shear, stress, component, 0, representing, the, elimination, of, point, defect, impedance, to, dislocation, migration, thus, the, temperature, independent, critical, resolved, shear, stress, crss, a, remains, so, until, region, 3, is, defined, notably, in, region, 2, moderate, temperature, time, dependent, plastic, deformation, creep, mechanisms, such, as, solute, drag, should, be, considered, furthermore, in, the, high, temperature, region, 3, t, 0, 7, t, m, can, be, low, contributing, to, low, crss, however, plastic, flow, will, still, occur, due, to, thermally, activated, high, temperature, time, dependent, plastic, deformation, mechanisms, such, as, nabarro, herring, nh, and, coble, diffusional, flow, through, the, lattice, and, along, the, single, crystal, surfaces, respectively, as, well, as, dislocation, climb, glide, creep, during, the, easy, glide, stage, 1, the, work, hardening, rate, defined, by, the, change, in, shear, stress, with, respect, to, shear, strain, d, d, is, low, representative, of, a, small, amount, of, applied, shear, stress, necessary, to, induce, a, large, amount, of, shear, strain, facile, dislocation, glide, and, corresponding, flow, is, attributed, to, dislocation, migration, along, parallel, slip, planes, only, i, e, one, slip, system, moderate, impedance, to, dislocation, migration, along, parallel, slip, planes, is, exhibited, according, to, the, weak, stress, field, interactions, between, these, dislocations, which, heightens, with, smaller, interplanar, spacing, overall, these, migrating, dislocations, within, a, single, slip, system, act, as, weak, obstacles, to, flow, and, a, modest, rise, in, stress, is, observed, in, comparison, to, the, yield, stress, during, the, linear, hardening, stage, 2, of, flow, the, work, hardening, rate, becomes, high, as, considerable, stress, is, required, to, overcome, the, stress, field, interactions, of, dislocations, migrating, on, non, parallel, slip, planes, i, e, multiple, slip, systems, acting, as, strong, obstacles, to, flow, much, stress, is, required, to, drive, continual, dislocation, migration, for, small, strains, the, shear, flow, stress, is, directly, proportional, to, the, square, root, of, the, dislocation, density, flow, irrespective, of, the, evolution, of, dislocation, configurations, displaying, the, reliance, of, hardening, on, the, number, of, dislocations, present, regarding, this, evolution, of, dislocation, configurations, at, small, strains, the, dislocation, arrangement, is, a, random, 3d, array, of, intersecting, lines, moderate, strains, correspond, to, cellular, dislocation, structures, of, heterogeneous, dislocation, distribution, with, large, dislocation, density, at, the, cell, boundaries, and, small, dislocation, density, within, the, cell, interior, at, even, larger, strains, the, cellular, dislocation, structure, reduces, in, size, until, a, minimum, size, is, achieved, finally, the, work, hardening, rate, becomes, low, again, in, the, exhaustion, saturation, of, hardening, stage, 3, of, plastic, flow, as, small, shear, stresses, produce, large, shear, strains, notably, instances, when, multiple, slip, systems, are, oriented, favorably, with, respect, to, the, applied, stress, the, crss, for, these, systems, may, be, similar, and, yielding, may, occur, according, to, dislocation, migration, along, multiple, slip, systems, with, non, parallel, slip, planes, displaying, a, stage, 1, work, hardening, rate, typically, characteristic, of, stage, 2, lastly, distinction, between, time, independent, plastic, deformation, in, body, centered, cubic, transition, metals, and, face, centered, cubic, metals, is, summarized, below, plasticity, in, polycrystals, differs, substantially, from, that, in, single, crystals, due, to, the, presence, of, grain, boundary, gb, planar, defects, which, act, as, very, strong, obstacles, to, plastic, flow, by, impeding, dislocation, migration, along, the, entire, length, of, the, activated, slip, plane, s, hence, dislocations, cannot, pass, from, one, grain, to, another, across, the, grain, boundary, the, following, sections, explore, specific, gb, requirements, for, extensive, plastic, deformation, of, polycrystals, prior, to, fracture, as, well, as, the, influence, of, microscopic, yielding, within, individual, crystallites, on, macroscopic, yielding, of, the, polycrystal, the, critical, resolved, shear, stress, for, polycrystals, is, defined, by, schmid, s, law, as, well, crss, y, where, y, is, the, yield, strength, of, the, polycrystal, and, is, the, weighted, schmid, factor, the, weighted, schmid, factor, reflects, the, least, favorably, oriented, slip, system, among, the, most, favorably, oriented, slip, systems, of, the, grains, constituting, the, gb, the, gb, constraint, for, polycrystals, can, be, explained, by, considering, a, grain, boundary, in, the, xz, plane, between, two, single, crystals, a, and, b, of, identical, composition, structure, and, slip, systems, but, misoriented, with, respect, to, each, other, to, ensure, that, voids, do, not, form, between, individually, deforming, grains, the, gb, constraint, for, the, bicrystal, is, as, follows, xx, a, xx, b, the, x, axial, strain, at, the, gb, must, be, equivalent, for, a, and, b, zz, a, zz, b, the, z, axial, strain, at, the, gb, must, be, equivalent, for, a, and, b, and, xz, a, xz, b, the, xz, shear, strain, along, the, xz, gb, plane, must, be, equivalent, for, a, and, b, in, addition, this, gb, constraint, requires, that, five, independent, slip, systems, be, activated, per, crystallite, constituting, the, gb, notably, because, independent, slip, systems, are, defined, as, slip, planes, on, which, dislocation, migrations, cannot, be, reproduced, by, any, combination, of, dislocation, migrations, along, other, slip, system, s, planes, the, number, of, geometrical, slip, systems, for, a, given, crystal, system, which, by, definition, can, be, constructed, by, slip, system, combinations, is, typically, greater, than, that, of, independent, slip, systems, significantly, there, is, a, maximum, of, five, independent, slip, systems, for, each, of, the, seven, crystal, systems, however, not, all, seven, crystal, systems, acquire, this, upper, limit, in, fact, even, within, a, given, crystal, system, the, composition, and, bravais, lattice, diversifies, the, number, of, independent, slip, systems, see, the, table, below, in, cases, for, which, crystallites, of, a, polycrystal, do, not, obtain, five, independent, slip, systems, the, gb, condition, cannot, be, met, and, thus, the, time, independent, deformation, of, individual, crystallites, results, in, cracks, and, voids, at, the, gbs, of, the, polycrystal, and, soon, fracture, is, realized, hence, for, a, given, composition, and, structure, a, single, crystal, with, less, than, five, independent, slip, systems, is, stronger, exhibiting, a, greater, extent, of, plasticity, than, its, polycrystalline, form, although, the, two, crystallites, a, and, b, discussed, in, the, above, section, have, identical, slip, systems, they, are, misoriented, with, respect, to, each, other, and, therefore, misoriented, with, respect, to, the, applied, force, thus, microscopic, yielding, within, a, crystallite, interior, may, occur, according, to, the, rules, governing, single, crystal, time, independent, yielding, eventually, the, activated, slip, planes, within, the, grain, interiors, will, permit, dislocation, migration, to, the, gb, where, many, dislocations, then, pile, up, as, geometrically, necessary, dislocations, this, pile, up, corresponds, to, strain, gradients, across, individual, grains, as, the, dislocation, density, near, the, gb, is, greater, than, that, in, the, grain, interior, imposing, a, stress, on, the, adjacent, grain, in, contact, when, considering, the, ab, bicrystal, as, a, whole, the, most, favorably, oriented, slip, system, in, a, will, not, be, the, that, in, b, and, hence, a, crss, b, crss, paramount, is, the, fact, that, macroscopic, yielding, of, the, bicrystal, is, prolonged, until, the, higher, value, of, crss, between, grains, a, and, b, is, achieved, according, to, the, gb, constraint, thus, for, a, given, composition, and, structure, a, polycrystal, with, five, independent, slip, systems, is, stronger, greater, extent, of, plasticity, than, its, single, crystalline, form, correspondingly, the, work, hardening, rate, will, be, higher, for, the, polycrystal, than, the, single, crystal, as, more, stress, is, required, in, the, polycrystal, to, produce, strains, importantly, just, as, with, single, crystal, flow, stress, flow, but, is, also, inversely, proportional, to, the, square, root, of, average, grain, diameter, flow, d, therefore, the, flow, stress, of, a, polycrystal, and, hence, the, polycrystal, s, strength, increases, with, small, grain, size, the, reason, for, this, is, that, smaller, grains, have, a, relatively, smaller, number, of, slip, planes, to, be, activated, corresponding, to, a, fewer, number, of, dislocations, migrating, to, the, gbs, and, therefore, less, stress, induced, on, adjacent, grains, due, to, dislocation, pile, up, in, addition, for, a, given, volume, of, polycrystal, smaller, grains, present, more, strong, obstacle, grain, boundaries, these, two, factors, provide, an, understanding, as, to, why, the, onset, of, macroscopic, flow, in, fine, grained, polycrystals, occurs, at, larger, applied, stresses, than, in, coarse, grained, polycrystals, there, are, several, mathematical, descriptions, of, plasticity, one, is, deformation, theory, see, e, g, hooke, s, law, where, the, cauchy, stress, tensor, of, order, d, 1, in, d, dimensions, is, a, function, of, the, strain, tensor, although, this, description, is, accurate, when, a, small, part, of, matter, is, subjected, to, increasing, loading, such, as, strain, loading, this, theory, cannot, account, for, irreversibility, ductile, materials, can, sustain, large, plastic, deformations, without, fracture, however, even, ductile, metals, will, fracture, when, the, strain, becomes, large, enough, this, is, as, a, result, of, work, hardening, of, the, material, which, causes, it, to, become, brittle, heat, treatment, such, as, annealing, can, restore, the, ductility, of, a, worked, piece, so, that, shaping, can, continue, in, 1934, egon, orowan, michael, polanyi, and, geoffrey, ingram, taylor, roughly, simultaneously, realized, that, the, plastic, deformation, of, ductile, materials, could, be, explained, in, terms, of, the, theory, of, dislocations, the, mathematical, theory, of, plasticity, flow, plasticity, theory, uses, a, set, of, non, linear, non, integrable, equations, to, describe, the, set, of, changes, on, strain, and, stress, with, respect, to, a, previous, state, and, a, small, increase, of, deformation, if, the, stress, exceeds, a, critical, value, as, was, mentioned, above, the, material, will, undergo, plastic, or, irreversible, deformation, this, critical, stress, can, be, tensile, or, compressive, the, tresca, and, the, von, mises, criteria, are, commonly, used, to, determine, whether, a, material, has, yielded, however, these, criteria, have, proved, inadequate, for, a, large, range, of, materials, and, several, other, yield, criteria, are, also, in, widespread, use, the, tresca, criterion, is, based, on, the, notion, that, when, a, material, fails, it, does, so, in, shear, which, is, a, relatively, good, assumption, when, considering, metals, given, the, principal, stress, state, we, can, use, mohr, s, circle, to, solve, for, the, maximum, shear, stresses, our, material, will, experience, and, conclude, that, the, material, will, fail, if, where, 1, is, the, maximum, normal, stress, 3, is, the, minimum, normal, stress, and, 0, is, the, stress, under, which, the, material, fails, in, uniaxial, loading, a, yield, surface, may, be, constructed, which, provides, a, visual, representation, of, this, concept, inside, of, the, yield, surface, deformation, is, elastic, on, the, surface, deformation, is, plastic, it, is, impossible, for, a, material, to, have, stress, states, outside, its, yield, surface, the, huber, von, mises, criterion, is, based, on, the, tresca, criterion, but, takes, into, account, the, assumption, that, hydrostatic, stresses, do, not, contribute, to, material, failure, m, t, huber, was, the, first, who, proposed, the, criterion, of, shear, energy, von, mises, solves, for, an, effective, stress, under, uniaxial, loading, subtracting, out, hydrostatic, stresses, and, states, that, all, effective, stresses, greater, than, that, which, causes, material, failure, in, uniaxial, loading, will, result, in, plastic, deformation, again, a, visual, representation, of, the, yield, surface, may, be, constructed, using, the, above, equation, which, takes, the, shape, of, an, ellipse, inside, the, surface, materials, undergo, elastic, deformation, reaching, the, surface, means, the, material, undergoes, plastic, deformations
