the, lumen, symbol, lm, is, the, unit, of, luminous, flux, a, measure, of, the, perceived, power, of, visible, light, emitted, by, a, source, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, luminous, flux, differs, from, power, radiant, flux, in, that, radiant, flux, includes, all, electromagnetic, waves, emitted, while, luminous, flux, is, weighted, according, to, a, model, a, luminosity, function, of, the, human, eye, s, sensitivity, to, various, wavelengths, this, weighting, is, standardized, by, the, cie, and, iso, one, lux, is, one, lumen, per, square, metre, the, lumen, is, defined, in, relation, to, the, candela, as, a, full, sphere, has, a, solid, angle, of, 4, steradians, so, a, light, source, that, uniformly, radiates, one, candela, in, all, directions, has, a, total, luminous, flux, of, if, a, light, source, emits, one, candela, of, luminous, intensity, uniformly, across, a, solid, angle, of, one, steradian, the, total, luminous, flux, emitted, into, that, angle, is, one, lumen, 1, cd, 1, sr, 1, lm, alternatively, an, isotropic, one, candela, light, source, emits, a, total, luminous, flux, of, exactly, 4, lumens, if, the, source, were, partly, covered, by, an, ideal, absorbing, hemisphere, that, system, would, radiate, half, as, much, luminous, flux, only, 2, lumens, the, luminous, intensity, would, still, be, one, candela, in, those, directions, that, are, not, obscured, the, lumen, can, be, thought, of, casually, as, a, measure, of, the, total, amount, of, visible, light, in, some, defined, beam, or, angle, or, emitted, from, some, source, the, number, of, candelas, or, lumens, from, a, source, also, depends, on, its, spectrum, via, the, nominal, response, of, the, human, eye, as, represented, in, the, luminosity, function, the, difference, between, the, units, lumen, and, lux, is, that, the, lux, takes, into, account, the, area, over, which, the, luminous, flux, is, spread, a, flux, of, 1, 000, lumens, concentrated, into, an, area, of, one, square, metre, lights, up, that, square, metre, with, an, illuminance, of, 1, 000, lux, the, same, 1, 000, lumens, spread, out, over, ten, square, metres, produces, a, dimmer, illuminance, of, only, 100, lux, mathematically, 1, lx, 1, lm, m, 2, a, source, radiating, a, power, of, one, watt, of, light, in, the, color, for, which, the, eye, is, most, efficient, a, wavelength, of, 555, nm, in, the, green, region, of, the, optical, spectrum, has, luminous, flux, of, 683, lumens, so, a, lumen, represents, at, least, 1, 683, watts, of, visible, light, power, depending, on, the, spectral, distribution, lamps, used, for, lighting, are, commonly, labelled, with, their, light, output, in, lumens, in, many, jurisdictions, this, is, required, by, law, a, 23, w, spiral, compact, fluorescent, lamp, emits, about, 1, 400, 1, 600, lm, many, compact, fluorescent, lamps, and, other, alternative, light, sources, are, labelled, as, being, equivalent, to, an, incandescent, bulb, with, a, specific, power, below, is, a, table, that, shows, typical, luminous, flux, for, common, incandescent, bulbs, and, their, equivalents, the, typical, luminous, efficacy, of, fluorescent, lighting, systems, is, 50, 100, lumens, per, watt, on, 1, september, 2010, european, union, legislation, came, into, force, mandating, that, lighting, equipment, must, be, labelled, primarily, in, terms, of, luminous, flux, lm, instead, of, electric, power, w, that, change, is, a, result, of, the, eu, s, eco, design, directive, for, energy, using, products, eup, for, example, according, to, the, european, union, standard, an, energy, efficient, bulb, that, claims, to, be, the, equivalent, of, a, 60, w, tungsten, bulb, must, have, a, minimum, light, output, of, 700, 810, lm, the, light, output, of, projectors, including, video, projectors, is, typically, measured, in, lumens, a, standardized, procedure, for, testing, projectors, has, been, established, by, the, american, national, standards, institute, which, involves, averaging, together, several, measurements, taken, at, different, positions, for, marketing, purposes, the, luminous, flux, of, projectors, that, have, been, tested, according, to, this, procedure, may, be, quoted, in, ansi, lumens, to, distinguish, them, from, those, tested, by, other, methods, ansi, lumen, measurements, are, in, general, more, accurate, than, the, other, measurement, techniques, used, in, the, projector, industry, this, allows, projectors, to, be, more, easily, compared, on, the, basis, of, their, brightness, specifications, the, method, for, measuring, ansi, lumens, is, defined, in, the, it7, 215, document, which, was, created, in, 1992, first, the, projector, is, set, up, to, display, an, image, in, a, room, at, a, temperature, of, 25, c, 77, f, the, brightness, and, contrast, of, the, projector, are, adjusted, so, that, on, a, full, white, field, it, is, possible, to, distinguish, between, a, 5, screen, area, block, of, 95, peak, white, and, two, identically, sized, 100, and, 90, peak, white, boxes, at, the, center, of, the, white, field, the, light, output, is, then, measured, on, a, full, white, field, at, nine, specific, locations, around, the, screen, and, averaged, this, average, is, then, multiplied, by, the, screen, area, to, give, the, brightness, of, the, projector, in, ansi, lumens, peak, lumens, is, a, measure, of, light, output, normally, used, with, crt, video, projectors, the, testing, uses, a, test, pattern, typically, at, either, 10, and, 20, percent, of, the, image, area, as, white, at, the, center, of, the, screen, the, rest, as, black, the, light, output, is, measured, just, in, this, center, area, limitations, with, crt, video, projectors, result, in, them, producing, greater, brightness, when, just, a, fraction, of, the, image, content, is, at, peak, brightness, for, example, the, sony, vph, g70q, crt, video, projector, produces, 1200, peak, lumens, but, just, 200, ansi, lumens, brightness, white, light, output, measures, the, total, amount, of, light, projected, in, lumens, the, color, brightness, specification, color, light, output, measures, red, green, and, blue, each, on, a, nine, point, grid, using, the, same, approach, as, that, used, to, measure, brightness
