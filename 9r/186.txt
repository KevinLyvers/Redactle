in, astronomy, photometry, from, greek, photo, light, and, metry, measure, is, a, technique, used, in, astronomy, that, is, concerned, with, measuring, the, flux, or, intensity, of, light, radiated, by, astronomical, objects, this, light, is, measured, through, a, telescope, using, a, photometer, often, made, using, electronic, devices, such, as, a, ccd, photometer, or, a, photoelectric, photometer, that, converts, light, into, an, electric, current, by, the, photoelectric, effect, when, calibrated, against, standard, stars, or, other, light, sources, of, known, intensity, and, colour, photometers, can, measure, the, brightness, or, apparent, magnitude, of, celestial, objects, the, methods, used, to, perform, photometry, depend, on, the, wavelength, region, under, study, at, its, most, basic, photometry, is, conducted, by, gathering, light, and, passing, it, through, specialized, photometric, optical, bandpass, filters, and, then, capturing, and, recording, the, light, energy, with, a, photosensitive, instrument, standard, sets, of, passbands, called, a, photometric, system, are, defined, to, allow, accurate, comparison, of, observations, a, more, advanced, technique, is, spectrophotometry, that, is, measured, with, a, spectrophotometer, and, observes, both, the, amount, of, radiation, and, its, detailed, spectral, distribution, photometry, is, also, used, in, the, observation, of, variable, stars, by, various, techniques, such, as, differential, photometry, that, simultaneously, measures, the, brightness, of, a, target, object, and, nearby, stars, in, the, starfield, or, relative, photometry, by, comparing, the, brightness, of, the, target, object, to, stars, with, known, fixed, magnitudes, using, multiple, bandpass, filters, with, relative, photometry, is, termed, absolute, photometry, a, plot, of, magnitude, against, time, produces, a, light, curve, yielding, considerable, information, about, the, physical, process, causing, the, brightness, changes, precision, photoelectric, photometers, can, measure, starlight, around, 0, 001, magnitude, the, technique, of, surface, photometry, can, also, be, used, with, extended, objects, like, planets, comets, nebulae, or, galaxies, that, measures, the, apparent, magnitude, in, terms, of, magnitudes, per, square, arcsecond, knowing, the, area, of, the, object, and, the, average, intensity, of, light, across, the, astronomical, object, determines, the, surface, brightness, in, terms, of, magnitudes, per, square, arcsecond, while, integrating, the, total, light, of, the, extended, object, can, then, calculate, brightness, in, terms, of, its, total, magnitude, energy, output, or, luminosity, per, unit, surface, area, astronomy, was, among, the, earliest, applications, of, photometry, modern, photometers, use, specialised, standard, passband, filters, across, the, ultraviolet, visible, and, infrared, wavelengths, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, any, adopted, set, of, filters, with, known, light, transmission, properties, is, called, a, photometric, system, and, allows, the, establishment, of, particular, properties, about, stars, and, other, types, of, astronomical, objects, several, important, systems, are, regularly, used, such, as, the, ubv, system, or, the, extended, ubvri, system, near, infrared, jhk, or, the, str, mgren, uvby, system, historically, photometry, in, the, near, infrared, through, short, wavelength, ultra, violet, was, done, with, a, photoelectric, photometer, an, instrument, that, measured, the, light, intensity, of, a, single, object, by, directing, its, light, onto, a, photosensitive, cell, like, a, photomultiplier, tube, these, have, largely, been, replaced, with, ccd, cameras, that, can, simultaneously, image, multiple, objects, although, photoelectric, photometers, are, still, used, in, special, situations, such, as, where, fine, time, resolution, is, required, modern, photometric, methods, define, magnitudes, and, colours, of, astronomical, objects, using, electronic, photometers, viewed, through, standard, coloured, bandpass, filters, this, differs, from, other, expressions, of, apparent, visual, magnitude, observed, by, the, human, eye, or, obtained, by, photography, that, usually, appear, in, older, astronomical, texts, and, catalogues, magnitudes, measured, by, photometers, in, some, commonplace, photometric, systems, ubv, ubvri, or, jhk, are, expressed, with, a, capital, letter, such, as, v, m, v, or, b, m, b, other, magnitudes, estimated, by, the, human, eye, are, expressed, using, lower, case, letters, such, as, v, b, or, p, etc, e, g, visual, magnitudes, as, m, v, while, photographic, magnitudes, are, m, ph, m, p, or, photovisual, magnitudes, m, p, or, m, pv, hence, a, 6th, magnitude, star, might, be, stated, as, 6, 0v, 6, 0b, 6, 0v, or, 6, 0p, because, starlight, is, measured, over, a, different, range, of, wavelengths, across, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, and, are, affected, by, different, instrumental, photometric, sensitivities, to, light, they, are, not, necessarily, equivalent, in, numerical, value, for, example, apparent, magnitude, in, the, ubv, system, for, the, solar, like, star, 51, pegasi, is, 5, 46v, 6, 16b, or, 6, 39u, corresponding, to, magnitudes, observed, through, each, of, the, visual, v, blue, b, or, ultraviolet, u, filters, magnitude, differences, between, filters, indicate, colour, differences, and, are, related, to, temperature, using, b, and, v, filters, in, the, ubv, system, produces, the, b, v, colour, index, for, 51, pegasi, the, b, v, 6, 16, 5, 46, 0, 70, suggesting, a, yellow, coloured, star, that, agrees, with, its, g2iv, spectral, type, knowing, the, b, v, results, determines, the, star, s, surface, temperature, finding, an, effective, surface, temperature, of, 5768, 8, k, another, important, application, of, colour, indices, is, graphically, plotting, star, s, apparent, magnitude, against, the, b, v, colour, index, this, forms, the, important, relationships, found, between, sets, of, stars, in, colour, magnitude, diagrams, which, for, stars, is, the, observed, version, of, the, hertzsprung, russell, diagram, typically, photometric, measurements, of, multiple, objects, obtained, through, two, filters, will, show, for, example, in, an, open, cluster, the, comparative, stellar, evolution, between, the, component, stars, or, to, determine, the, cluster, s, relative, age, due, to, the, large, number, of, different, photometric, systems, adopted, by, astronomers, there, are, many, expressions, of, magnitudes, and, their, indices, each, of, these, newer, photometric, systems, excluding, ubv, ubvri, or, jhk, systems, assigns, an, upper, or, lower, case, letter, to, the, filter, used, for, example, magnitudes, used, by, gaia, are, g, with, the, blue, and, red, photometric, filters, g, bp, and, g, rp, or, the, str, mgren, photometric, system, having, lower, case, letters, of, u, v, b, y, and, two, narrow, and, wide, hydrogen, beta, filters, some, photometric, systems, also, have, certain, advantages, for, example, str, mgren, photometry, can, be, used, to, measure, the, effects, of, reddening, and, interstellar, extinction, str, mgren, allows, calculation, of, parameters, from, the, b, and, y, filters, colour, index, of, b, y, without, the, effects, of, reddening, as, the, indices, m, 1, and, c, 1, there, are, many, astronomical, applications, used, with, photometric, systems, photometric, measurements, can, be, combined, with, the, inverse, square, law, to, determine, the, luminosity, of, an, object, if, its, distance, can, be, determined, or, its, distance, if, its, luminosity, is, known, other, physical, properties, of, an, object, such, as, its, temperature, or, chemical, composition, may, also, be, determined, via, broad, or, narrow, band, spectrophotometry, photometry, is, also, used, to, study, the, light, variations, of, objects, such, as, variable, stars, minor, planets, active, galactic, nuclei, and, supernovae, or, to, detect, transiting, extrasolar, planets, measurements, of, these, variations, can, be, used, for, example, to, determine, the, orbital, period, and, the, radii, of, the, members, of, an, eclipsing, binary, star, system, the, rotation, period, of, a, minor, planet, or, a, star, or, the, total, energy, output, of, supernovae, a, ccd, charge, coupled, device, camera, is, essentially, a, grid, of, photometers, simultaneously, measuring, and, recording, the, photons, coming, from, all, the, sources, in, the, field, of, view, because, each, ccd, image, records, the, photometry, of, multiple, objects, at, once, various, forms, of, photometric, extraction, can, be, performed, on, the, recorded, data, typically, relative, absolute, and, differential, all, three, will, require, the, extraction, of, the, raw, image, magnitude, of, the, target, object, and, a, known, comparison, object, the, observed, signal, from, an, object, will, typically, cover, many, pixels, according, to, the, point, spread, function, psf, of, the, system, this, broadening, is, due, to, both, the, optics, in, the, telescope, and, the, astronomical, seeing, when, obtaining, photometry, from, a, point, source, the, flux, is, measured, by, summing, all, the, light, recorded, from, the, object, and, subtracting, the, light, due, to, the, sky, the, simplest, technique, known, as, aperture, photometry, consists, of, summing, the, pixel, counts, within, an, aperture, centered, on, the, object, and, subtracting, the, product, of, the, nearby, average, sky, count, per, pixel, and, the, number, of, pixels, within, the, aperture, this, will, result, in, the, raw, flux, value, of, the, target, object, when, doing, photometry, in, a, very, crowded, field, such, as, a, globular, cluster, where, the, profiles, of, stars, overlap, significantly, one, must, use, de, blending, techniques, such, as, psf, fitting, to, determine, the, individual, flux, values, of, the, overlapping, sources, after, determining, the, flux, of, an, object, in, counts, the, flux, is, normally, converted, into, instrumental, magnitude, then, the, measurement, is, calibrated, in, some, way, which, calibrations, are, used, will, depend, in, part, on, what, type, of, photometry, is, being, done, typically, observations, are, processed, for, relative, or, differential, photometry, relative, photometry, is, the, measurement, of, the, apparent, brightness, of, multiple, objects, relative, to, each, other, absolute, photometry, is, the, measurement, of, the, apparent, brightness, of, an, object, on, a, standard, photometric, system, these, measurements, can, be, compared, with, other, absolute, photometric, measurements, obtained, with, different, telescopes, or, instruments, differential, photometry, is, the, measurement, of, the, difference, in, brightness, of, two, objects, in, most, cases, differential, photometry, can, be, done, with, the, highest, precision, while, absolute, photometry, is, the, most, difficult, to, do, with, high, precision, also, accurate, photometry, is, usually, more, difficult, when, the, apparent, brightness, of, the, object, is, fainter, to, perform, absolute, photometry, one, must, correct, for, differences, between, the, effective, passband, through, which, an, object, is, observed, and, the, passband, used, to, define, the, standard, photometric, system, this, is, often, in, addition, to, all, of, the, other, corrections, discussed, above, typically, this, correction, is, done, by, observing, the, object, s, of, interest, through, multiple, filters, and, also, observing, a, number, of, photometric, standard, stars, if, the, standard, stars, cannot, be, observed, simultaneously, with, the, target, s, this, correction, must, be, done, under, photometric, conditions, when, the, sky, is, cloudless, and, the, extinction, is, a, simple, function, of, the, airmass, to, perform, relative, photometry, one, compares, the, instrument, magnitude, of, the, object, to, a, known, comparison, object, and, then, corrects, the, measurements, for, spatial, variations, in, the, sensitivity, of, the, instrument, and, the, atmospheric, extinction, this, is, often, in, addition, to, correcting, for, their, temporal, variations, particularly, when, the, objects, being, compared, are, too, far, apart, on, the, sky, to, be, observed, simultaneously, when, doing, the, calibration, from, an, image, that, contains, both, the, target, and, comparison, objects, in, close, proximity, and, using, a, photometric, filter, that, matches, the, catalog, magnitude, of, the, comparison, object, most, of, the, measurement, variations, decrease, to, null, differential, photometry, is, the, simplest, of, the, calibrations, and, most, useful, for, time, series, observations, when, using, ccd, photometry, both, the, target, and, comparison, objects, are, observed, at, the, same, time, with, the, same, filters, using, the, same, instrument, and, viewed, through, the, same, optical, path, most, of, the, observational, variables, drop, out, and, the, differential, magnitude, is, simply, the, difference, between, the, instrument, magnitude, of, the, target, object, and, the, comparison, object, mag, c, mag, t, mag, this, is, very, useful, when, plotting, the, change, in, magnitude, over, time, of, a, target, object, and, is, usually, compiled, into, a, light, curve, for, spatially, extended, objects, such, as, galaxies, it, is, often, of, interest, to, measure, the, spatial, distribution, of, brightness, within, the, galaxy, rather, than, simply, measuring, the, galaxy, s, total, brightness, an, object, s, surface, brightness, is, its, brightness, per, unit, solid, angle, as, seen, in, projection, on, the, sky, and, measurement, of, surface, brightness, is, known, as, surface, photometry, a, common, application, would, be, measurement, of, a, galaxy, s, surface, brightness, profile, meaning, its, surface, brightness, as, a, function, of, distance, from, the, galaxy, s, center, for, small, solid, angles, a, useful, unit, of, solid, angle, is, the, square, arcsecond, and, surface, brightness, is, often, expressed, in, magnitudes, per, square, arcsecond, the, diameter, of, galaxies, are, often, defined, by, the, size, of, the, 25th, magnitude, isophote, in, the, blue, b, band, in, forced, photometry, measurements, are, conducted, at, a, specified, location, rather, than, for, a, specified, object, it, is, forced, in, the, sense, that, a, measurement, can, be, taken, even, if, there, is, no, object, visible, in, the, spectral, band, of, interest, in, the, location, being, observed, forced, photometry, allows, extracting, a, magnitude, or, an, upper, limit, for, the, magnitude, at, a, chosen, sky, location, a, number, of, free, computer, programs, are, available, for, synthetic, aperture, photometry, and, psf, fitting, photometry, sextractor, and, aperture, photometry, tool, are, popular, examples, for, aperture, photometry, the, former, is, geared, towards, reduction, of, large, scale, galaxy, survey, data, and, the, latter, has, a, graphical, user, interface, gui, suitable, for, studying, individual, images, daophot, is, recognized, as, the, best, software, for, psf, fitting, photometry, there, are, a, number, of, organizations, from, professional, to, amateur, that, gather, and, share, photometric, data, and, make, it, available, on, line, some, sites, gather, the, data, primarily, as, a, resource, for, other, researchers, ex, aavso, and, some, solicit, contributions, of, data, for, their, own, research, ex, cba
