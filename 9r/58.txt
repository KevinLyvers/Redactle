the, lux, symbol, lx, is, the, unit, of, illuminance, or, luminous, flux, per, unit, area, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, it, is, equal, to, one, lumen, per, square, metre, in, photometry, this, is, used, as, a, measure, of, the, intensity, as, perceived, by, the, human, eye, of, light, that, hits, or, passes, through, a, surface, it, is, analogous, to, the, radiometric, unit, watt, per, square, metre, but, with, the, power, at, each, wavelength, weighted, according, to, the, luminosity, function, a, model, of, human, visual, brightness, perception, standardized, by, the, cie, and, iso, in, english, lux, is, used, as, both, the, singular, and, plural, form, the, word, is, derived, from, the, latin, word, for, light, lux, illuminance, is, a, measure, of, how, much, luminous, flux, is, spread, over, a, given, area, one, can, think, of, luminous, flux, with, the, unit, lumen, as, a, measure, of, the, total, amount, of, visible, light, present, and, the, illuminance, as, a, measure, of, the, intensity, of, illumination, on, a, surface, a, given, amount, of, light, will, illuminate, a, surface, more, dimly, if, it, is, spread, over, a, larger, area, so, illuminance, is, inversely, proportional, to, area, when, the, luminous, flux, is, held, constant, one, lux, is, equal, to, one, lumen, per, square, metre, a, flux, of, 1000, lumens, spread, uniformly, over, an, area, of, 1, square, metre, lights, up, that, square, metre, with, an, illuminance, of, 1000, lux, however, the, same, 1000, lumens, spread, out, over, 10, square, metres, produces, a, dimmer, illuminance, of, only, 100, lux, achieving, an, illuminance, of, 500, lx, might, be, possible, in, a, home, kitchen, with, a, single, fluorescent, light, fixture, with, an, output, of, 12, 000, lumens, to, light, a, factory, floor, with, dozens, of, times, the, area, of, the, kitchen, would, require, dozens, of, such, fixtures, thus, lighting, a, larger, area, to, the, same, illuminance, lux, requires, a, greater, luminous, flux, lumen, as, with, other, named, si, units, si, prefixes, can, be, used, for, example, 1, kilolux, klx, is, 1000, lx, here, are, some, examples, of, the, illuminance, provided, under, various, conditions, the, illuminance, provided, by, a, light, source, on, a, surface, perpendicular, to, the, direction, to, the, source, is, a, measure, of, the, strength, of, that, source, as, perceived, from, that, location, for, instance, a, star, of, apparent, magnitude, 0, provides, 2, 08, microlux, lx, at, the, earth, s, surface, a, barely, perceptible, magnitude, 6, star, provides, 8, nanolux, nlx, the, unobscured, sun, provides, an, illumination, of, up, to, 100, kilolux, klx, on, the, earth, s, surface, the, exact, value, depending, on, time, of, year, and, atmospheric, conditions, this, direct, normal, illuminance, is, related, to, the, solar, illuminance, constant, e, sc, equal, to, 128, 000, lux, see, sunlight, and, solar, constant, the, illuminance, on, a, surface, depends, on, how, the, surface, is, tilted, with, respect, to, the, source, for, example, a, pocket, flashlight, aimed, at, a, wall, will, produce, a, given, level, of, illumination, if, aimed, perpendicular, to, the, wall, but, if, the, flashlight, is, aimed, at, increasing, angles, to, the, perpendicular, maintaining, the, same, distance, the, illuminated, spot, becomes, larger, and, so, is, less, highly, illuminated, when, a, surface, is, tilted, at, an, angle, to, a, source, the, illumination, provided, on, the, surface, is, reduced, because, the, tilted, surface, subtends, a, smaller, solid, angle, from, the, source, and, therefore, it, receives, less, light, for, a, point, source, the, illumination, on, the, tilted, surface, is, reduced, by, a, factor, equal, to, the, cosine, of, the, angle, between, a, ray, coming, from, the, source, and, the, normal, to, the, surface, in, practical, lighting, problems, given, information, on, the, way, light, is, emitted, from, each, source, and, the, distance, and, geometry, of, the, lighted, area, a, numerical, calculation, can, be, made, of, the, illumination, on, a, surface, by, adding, the, contributions, of, every, point, on, every, light, source, like, all, photometric, units, the, lux, has, a, corresponding, radiometric, unit, the, difference, between, any, photometric, unit, and, its, corresponding, radiometric, unit, is, that, radiometric, units, are, based, on, physical, power, with, all, wavelengths, being, weighted, equally, while, photometric, units, take, into, account, the, fact, that, the, human, eye, s, image, forming, visual, system, is, more, sensitive, to, some, wavelengths, than, others, and, accordingly, every, wavelength, is, given, a, different, weight, the, weighting, factor, is, known, as, the, luminosity, function, the, lux, is, one, lumen, per, square, metre, lm, m, 2, and, the, corresponding, radiometric, unit, which, measures, irradiance, is, the, watt, per, square, metre, w, m, 2, there, is, no, single, conversion, factor, between, lux, and, w, m, 2, there, is, a, different, conversion, factor, for, every, wavelength, and, it, is, not, possible, to, make, a, conversion, unless, one, knows, the, spectral, composition, of, the, light, the, peak, of, the, luminosity, function, is, at, 555, nm, green, the, eye, s, image, forming, visual, system, is, more, sensitive, to, light, of, this, wavelength, than, any, other, for, monochromatic, light, of, this, wavelength, the, amount, of, illuminance, for, a, given, amount, of, irradiance, is, maximum, 683, 002, lx, per, 1, w, m, 2, the, irradiance, needed, to, make, 1, lx, at, this, wavelength, is, about, 1, 464, mw, m, 2, other, wavelengths, of, visible, light, produce, fewer, lux, per, watt, per, meter, squared, the, luminosity, function, falls, to, zero, for, wavelengths, outside, the, visible, spectrum, for, a, light, source, with, mixed, wavelengths, the, number, of, lumens, per, watt, can, be, calculated, by, means, of, the, luminosity, function, in, order, to, appear, reasonably, white, a, light, source, cannot, consist, solely, of, the, green, light, to, which, the, eye, s, image, forming, visual, photoreceptors, are, most, sensitive, but, must, include, a, generous, mixture, of, red, and, blue, wavelengths, to, which, they, are, much, less, sensitive, this, means, that, white, or, whitish, light, sources, produce, far, fewer, lumens, per, watt, than, the, theoretical, maximum, of, 683, 002, lm, w, the, ratio, between, the, actual, number, of, lumens, per, watt, and, the, theoretical, maximum, is, expressed, as, a, percentage, known, as, the, luminous, efficiency, for, example, a, typical, incandescent, light, bulb, has, a, luminous, efficiency, of, only, about, 2, in, reality, individual, eyes, vary, slightly, in, their, luminosity, functions, however, photometric, units, are, precisely, defined, and, precisely, measurable, they, are, based, on, an, agreed, upon, standard, luminosity, function, based, on, measurements, of, the, spectral, characteristics, of, image, forming, visual, photoreception, in, many, individual, human, eyes, specifications, for, video, cameras, such, as, camcorders, and, surveillance, cameras, often, include, a, minimal, illuminance, level, in, lux, at, which, the, camera, will, record, a, satisfactory, image, a, camera, with, good, low, light, capability, will, have, a, lower, lux, rating, still, cameras, do, not, use, such, a, specification, since, longer, exposure, times, can, generally, be, used, to, make, pictures, at, very, low, illuminance, levels, as, opposed, to, the, case, in, video, cameras, where, a, maximal, exposure, time, is, generally, set, by, the, frame, rate, the, corresponding, unit, in, english, and, american, traditional, units, is, the, foot, candle, one, foot, candle, is, about, 10, 764, lx, since, one, foot, candle, is, the, illuminance, cast, on, a, surface, by, a, one, candela, source, one, foot, away, a, lux, could, be, thought, of, as, a, metre, candle, although, this, term, is, discouraged, because, it, does, not, conform, to, si, standards, for, unit, names, one, phot, ph, equals, 10, kilolux, 10, klx, one, nox, nx, equals, 1, millilux, 1, mlx, at, light, color, 2042, k, or, 2046, k, formerly, 2360, k, in, astronomy, apparent, magnitude, is, a, measure, of, the, illuminance, of, a, star, on, the, earth, s, atmosphere, a, star, with, apparent, magnitude, 0, is, 2, 54, microlux, outside, the, earth, s, atmosphere, and, 82, of, that, 2, 08, microlux, under, clear, skies, a, magnitude, 6, star, just, barely, visible, under, good, conditions, would, be, 8, 3, nanolux, a, standard, candle, one, candela, a, kilometre, away, would, provide, an, illuminance, of, 1, microlux, about, the, same, as, a, magnitude, 1, star, unicode, includes, a, symbol, for, lx, u, 33d3, square, lx, it, is, a, legacy, code, to, accommodate, old, code, pages, in, some, asian, languages, use, of, this, code, is, not, recommended, in, new, documents
