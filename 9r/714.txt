soil, also, commonly, referred, to, as, earth, or, dirt, is, a, mixture, of, organic, matter, minerals, gases, liquids, and, organisms, that, together, support, the, life, of, plants, and, soil, organisms, some, scientific, definitions, distinguish, dirt, from, soil, by, restricting, the, former, term, specifically, to, displaced, soil, soil, consists, of, a, solid, phase, of, minerals, and, organic, matter, the, soil, matrix, as, well, as, a, porous, phase, that, holds, gases, the, soil, atmosphere, and, water, the, soil, solution, accordingly, soil, is, a, three, state, system, of, solids, liquids, and, gases, soil, is, a, product, of, several, factors, the, influence, of, climate, relief, elevation, orientation, and, slope, of, terrain, organisms, and, the, soil, s, parent, materials, original, minerals, interacting, over, time, it, continually, undergoes, development, by, way, of, numerous, physical, chemical, and, biological, processes, which, include, weathering, with, associated, erosion, given, its, complexity, and, strong, internal, connectedness, soil, ecologists, regard, soil, as, an, ecosystem, most, soils, have, a, dry, bulk, density, density, of, soil, taking, into, account, voids, when, dry, between, 1, 1, and, 1, 6, g, cm, 3, though, the, soil, particle, density, is, much, higher, in, the, range, of, 2, 6, to, 2, 7, g, cm, 3, little, of, the, soil, of, planet, earth, is, older, than, the, pleistocene, and, none, is, older, than, the, cenozoic, although, fossilized, soils, are, preserved, from, as, far, back, as, the, archean, collectively, the, earth, s, body, of, soil, is, called, the, pedosphere, the, pedosphere, interfaces, with, the, lithosphere, the, hydrosphere, the, atmosphere, and, the, biosphere, soil, has, four, important, functions, all, of, these, functions, in, their, turn, modify, the, soil, and, its, properties, soil, science, has, two, basic, branches, of, study, edaphology, and, pedology, edaphology, studies, the, influence, of, soils, on, living, things, pedology, focuses, on, the, formation, description, morphology, and, classification, of, soils, in, their, natural, environment, in, engineering, terms, soil, is, included, in, the, broader, concept, of, regolith, which, also, includes, other, loose, material, that, lies, above, the, bedrock, as, can, be, found, on, the, moon, and, other, celestial, objects, soil, is, a, major, component, of, the, earth, s, ecosystem, the, world, s, ecosystems, are, impacted, in, far, reaching, ways, by, the, processes, carried, out, in, the, soil, with, effects, ranging, from, ozone, depletion, and, global, warming, to, rainforest, destruction, and, water, pollution, with, respect, to, earth, s, carbon, cycle, soil, acts, as, an, important, carbon, reservoir, and, it, is, potentially, one, of, the, most, reactive, to, human, disturbance, and, climate, change, as, the, planet, warms, it, has, been, predicted, that, soils, will, add, carbon, dioxide, to, the, atmosphere, due, to, increased, biological, activity, at, higher, temperatures, a, positive, feedback, amplification, this, prediction, has, however, been, questioned, on, consideration, of, more, recent, knowledge, on, soil, carbon, turnover, soil, acts, as, an, engineering, medium, a, habitat, for, soil, organisms, a, recycling, system, for, nutrients, and, organic, wastes, a, regulator, of, water, quality, a, modifier, of, atmospheric, composition, and, a, medium, for, plant, growth, making, it, a, critically, important, provider, of, ecosystem, services, since, soil, has, a, tremendous, range, of, available, niches, and, habitats, it, contains, a, prominent, part, of, the, earth, s, genetic, diversity, a, gram, of, soil, can, contain, billions, of, organisms, belonging, to, thousands, of, species, mostly, microbial, and, largely, still, unexplored, soil, has, a, mean, prokaryotic, density, of, roughly, 10, 8, organisms, per, gram, whereas, the, ocean, has, no, more, than, 10, 7, prokaryotic, organisms, per, milliliter, gram, of, seawater, organic, carbon, held, in, soil, is, eventually, returned, to, the, atmosphere, through, the, process, of, respiration, carried, out, by, heterotrophic, organisms, but, a, substantial, part, is, retained, in, the, soil, in, the, form, of, soil, organic, matter, tillage, usually, increases, the, rate, of, soil, respiration, leading, to, the, depletion, of, soil, organic, matter, since, plant, roots, need, oxygen, aeration, is, an, important, characteristic, of, soil, this, ventilation, can, be, accomplished, via, networks, of, interconnected, soil, pores, which, also, absorb, and, hold, rainwater, making, it, readily, available, for, uptake, by, plants, since, plants, require, a, nearly, continuous, supply, of, water, but, most, regions, receive, sporadic, rainfall, the, water, holding, capacity, of, soils, is, vital, for, plant, survival, soils, can, effectively, remove, impurities, kill, disease, agents, and, degrade, contaminants, this, latter, property, being, called, natural, attenuation, typically, soils, maintain, a, net, absorption, of, oxygen, and, methane, and, undergo, a, net, release, of, carbon, dioxide, and, nitrous, oxide, soils, offer, plants, physical, support, air, water, temperature, moderation, nutrients, and, protection, from, toxins, soils, provide, readily, available, nutrients, to, plants, and, animals, by, converting, dead, organic, matter, into, various, nutrient, forms, components, of, a, silt, loam, soil, by, percent, volume, a, typical, soil, is, about, 50, solids, 45, mineral, and, 5, organic, matter, and, 50, voids, or, pores, of, which, half, is, occupied, by, water, and, half, by, gas, the, percent, soil, mineral, and, organic, content, can, be, treated, as, a, constant, in, the, short, term, while, the, percent, soil, water, and, gas, content, is, considered, highly, variable, whereby, a, rise, in, one, is, simultaneously, balanced, by, a, reduction, in, the, other, the, pore, space, allows, for, the, infiltration, and, movement, of, air, and, water, both, of, which, are, critical, for, life, existing, in, soil, compaction, a, common, problem, with, soils, reduces, this, space, preventing, air, and, water, from, reaching, plant, roots, and, soil, organisms, given, sufficient, time, an, undifferentiated, soil, will, evolve, a, soil, profile, that, consists, of, two, or, more, layers, referred, to, as, soil, horizons, these, differ, in, one, or, more, properties, such, as, in, their, texture, structure, density, porosity, consistency, temperature, color, and, reactivity, the, horizons, differ, greatly, in, thickness, and, generally, lack, sharp, boundaries, their, development, is, dependent, on, the, type, of, parent, material, the, processes, that, modify, those, parent, materials, and, the, soil, forming, factors, that, influence, those, processes, the, biological, influences, on, soil, properties, are, strongest, near, the, surface, though, the, geochemical, influences, on, soil, properties, increase, with, depth, mature, soil, profiles, typically, include, three, basic, master, horizons, a, b, and, c, the, solum, normally, includes, the, a, and, b, horizons, the, living, component, of, the, soil, is, largely, confined, to, the, solum, and, is, generally, more, prominent, in, the, a, horizon, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, pedon, a, column, of, soil, extending, vertically, from, the, surface, to, the, underlying, parent, material, and, large, enough, to, show, the, characteristics, of, all, its, horizons, could, be, subdivided, in, the, humipedon, the, living, part, where, most, soil, organisms, are, dwelling, corresponding, to, the, humus, form, the, copedon, in, intermediary, position, where, most, weathering, of, minerals, takes, place, and, the, lithopedon, in, contact, with, the, subsoil, the, soil, texture, is, determined, by, the, relative, proportions, of, the, individual, particles, of, sand, silt, and, clay, that, make, up, the, soil, the, interaction, of, the, individual, mineral, particles, with, organic, matter, water, gases, via, biotic, and, abiotic, processes, causes, those, particles, to, flocculate, stick, together, to, form, aggregates, or, peds, where, these, aggregates, can, be, identified, a, soil, can, be, said, to, be, developed, and, can, be, described, further, in, terms, of, color, porosity, consistency, reaction, acidity, etc, water, is, a, critical, agent, in, soil, development, due, to, its, involvement, in, the, dissolution, precipitation, erosion, transport, and, deposition, of, the, materials, of, which, a, soil, is, composed, the, mixture, of, water, and, dissolved, or, suspended, materials, that, occupy, the, soil, pore, space, is, called, the, soil, solution, since, soil, water, is, never, pure, water, but, contains, hundreds, of, dissolved, organic, and, mineral, substances, it, may, be, more, accurately, called, the, soil, solution, water, is, central, to, the, dissolution, precipitation, and, leaching, of, minerals, from, the, soil, profile, finally, water, affects, the, type, of, vegetation, that, grows, in, a, soil, which, in, turn, affects, the, development, of, the, soil, a, complex, feedback, which, is, exemplified, in, the, dynamics, of, banded, vegetation, patterns, in, semi, arid, regions, soils, supply, plants, with, nutrients, most, of, which, are, held, in, place, by, particles, of, clay, and, organic, matter, colloids, the, nutrients, may, be, adsorbed, on, clay, mineral, surfaces, bound, within, clay, minerals, absorbed, or, bound, within, organic, compounds, as, part, of, the, living, organisms, or, dead, soil, organic, matter, these, bound, nutrients, interact, with, soil, water, to, buffer, the, soil, solution, composition, attenuate, changes, in, the, soil, solution, as, soils, wet, up, or, dry, out, as, plants, take, up, nutrients, as, salts, are, leached, or, as, acids, or, alkalis, are, added, plant, nutrient, availability, is, affected, by, soil, ph, which, is, a, measure, of, the, hydrogen, ion, activity, in, the, soil, solution, soil, ph, is, a, function, of, many, soil, forming, factors, and, is, generally, lower, more, acidic, where, weathering, is, more, advanced, most, plant, nutrients, with, the, exception, of, nitrogen, originate, from, the, minerals, that, make, up, the, soil, parent, material, some, nitrogen, originates, from, rain, as, dilute, nitric, acid, and, ammonia, but, most, of, the, nitrogen, is, available, in, soils, as, a, result, of, nitrogen, fixation, by, bacteria, once, in, the, soil, plant, system, most, nutrients, are, recycled, through, living, organisms, plant, and, microbial, residues, soil, organic, matter, mineral, bound, forms, and, the, soil, solution, both, living, soil, organisms, microbes, animals, and, plant, roots, and, soil, organic, matter, are, of, critical, importance, to, this, recycling, and, thereby, to, soil, formation, and, soil, fertility, microbial, soil, enzymes, may, release, nutrients, from, minerals, or, organic, matter, for, use, by, plants, and, other, microorganisms, sequester, incorporate, them, into, living, cells, or, cause, their, loss, from, the, soil, by, volatilisation, loss, to, the, atmosphere, as, gases, or, leaching, soil, is, said, to, be, formed, when, organic, matter, has, accumulated, and, colloids, are, washed, downward, leaving, deposits, of, clay, humus, iron, oxide, carbonate, and, gypsum, producing, a, distinct, layer, called, the, b, horizon, this, is, a, somewhat, arbitrary, definition, as, mixtures, of, sand, silt, clay, and, humus, will, support, biological, and, agricultural, activity, before, that, time, these, constituents, are, moved, from, one, level, to, another, by, water, and, animal, activity, as, a, result, layers, horizons, form, in, the, soil, profile, the, alteration, and, movement, of, materials, within, a, soil, causes, the, formation, of, distinctive, soil, horizons, however, more, recent, definitions, of, soil, embrace, soils, without, any, organic, matter, such, as, those, regoliths, that, formed, on, mars, and, analogous, conditions, in, planet, earth, deserts, an, example, of, the, development, of, a, soil, would, begin, with, the, weathering, of, lava, flow, bedrock, which, would, produce, the, purely, mineral, based, parent, material, from, which, the, soil, texture, forms, soil, development, would, proceed, most, rapidly, from, bare, rock, of, recent, flows, in, a, warm, climate, under, heavy, and, frequent, rainfall, under, such, conditions, plants, in, a, first, stage, nitrogen, fixing, lichens, and, cyanobacteria, then, epilithic, higher, plants, become, established, very, quickly, on, basaltic, lava, even, though, there, is, very, little, organic, material, basaltic, minerals, commonly, weather, relatively, quickly, according, to, the, goldich, dissolution, series, the, plants, are, supported, by, the, porous, rock, as, it, is, filled, with, nutrient, bearing, water, that, carries, minerals, dissolved, from, the, rocks, crevasses, and, pockets, local, topography, of, the, rocks, would, hold, fine, materials, and, harbour, plant, roots, the, developing, plant, roots, are, associated, with, mineral, weathering, mycorrhizal, fungi, that, assist, in, breaking, up, the, porous, lava, and, by, these, means, organic, matter, and, a, finer, mineral, soil, accumulate, with, time, such, initial, stages, of, soil, development, have, been, described, on, volcanoes, inselbergs, and, glacial, moraines, how, soil, formation, proceeds, is, influenced, by, at, least, five, classic, factors, that, are, intertwined, in, the, evolution, of, a, soil, parent, material, climate, topography, relief, organisms, and, time, when, reordered, to, climate, relief, organisms, parent, material, and, time, they, form, the, acronym, cropt, the, physical, properties, of, soils, in, order, of, decreasing, importance, for, ecosystem, services, such, as, crop, production, are, texture, structure, bulk, density, porosity, consistency, temperature, colour, and, resistivity, soil, texture, is, determined, by, the, relative, proportion, of, the, three, kinds, of, soil, mineral, particles, called, soil, separates, sand, silt, and, clay, at, the, next, larger, scale, soil, structures, called, peds, or, more, commonly, soil, aggregates, are, created, from, the, soil, separates, when, iron, oxides, carbonates, clay, silica, and, humus, coat, particles, and, cause, them, to, adhere, into, larger, relatively, stable, secondary, structures, soil, bulk, density, when, determined, at, standardized, moisture,

petrichor, or, geosmin, soil, particles, can, be, classified, by, their, chemical, composition, mineralogy, as, well, as, their, size, the, particle, size, distribution, of, a, soil, its, texture, determines, many, of, the, properties, of, that, soil, in, particular, hydraulic, conductivity, and, water, potential, but, the, mineralogy, of, those, particles, can, strongly, modify, those, properties, the, mineralogy, of, the, finest, soil, particles, clay, is, especially, important, large, numbers, of, microbes, animals, plants, and, fungi, are, living, in, soil, however, biodiversity, in, soil, is, much, harder, to, study, as, most, of, this, life, is, invisible, hence, estimates, about, soil, biodiversity, have, been, unsatisfactory, a, recent, study, suggested, that, soil, is, likely, home, to, 59, 15, of, the, species, on, earth, enchytraeidae, worms, have, the, greatest, percentage, of, species, in, soil, 98, 6, followed, by, fungi, 90, plants, 85, 5, and, termites, isoptera, 84, 2, many, other, groups, of, animals, have, substantial, fractions, of, species, living, in, soil, e, g, about, 30, of, insects, and, close, to, 50, of, arachnids, while, most, vertebrates, live, above, ground, ignoring, aquatic, species, many, species, are, fossorial, that, is, they, live, in, soil, such, as, most, blind, snakes, the, chemistry, of, a, soil, determines, its, ability, to, supply, available, plant, nutrients, and, affects, its, physical, properties, and, the, health, of, its, living, population, in, addition, a, soil, s, chemistry, also, determines, its, corrosivity, stability, and, ability, to, absorb, pollutants, and, to, filter, water, it, is, the, surface, chemistry, of, mineral, and, organic, colloids, that, determines, soil, s, chemical, properties, a, colloid, is, a, small, insoluble, particle, ranging, in, size, from, 1, nanometer, to, 1, micrometer, thus, small, enough, to, remain, suspended, by, brownian, motion, in, a, fluid, medium, without, settling, most, soils, contain, organic, colloidal, particles, called, humus, as, well, as, the, inorganic, colloidal, particles, of, clays, the, very, high, specific, surface, area, of, colloids, and, their, net, electrical, charges, give, soil, its, ability, to, hold, and, release, ions, negatively, charged, sites, on, colloids, attract, and, release, cations, in, what, is, referred, to, as, cation, exchange, cation, exchange, capacity, is, the, amount, of, exchangeable, cations, per, unit, weight, of, dry, soil, and, is, expressed, in, terms, of, milliequivalents, of, positively, charged, ions, per, 100, grams, of, soil, or, centimoles, of, positive, charge, per, kilogram, of, soil, cmol, c, kg, similarly, positively, charged, sites, on, colloids, can, attract, and, release, anions, in, the, soil, giving, the, soil, anion, exchange, capacity, the, cation, exchange, that, takes, place, between, colloids, and, soil, water, buffers, moderates, soil, ph, alters, soil, structure, and, purifies, percolating, water, by, adsorbing, cations, of, all, types, both, useful, and, harmful, the, negative, or, positive, charges, on, colloid, particles, make, them, able, to, hold, cations, or, anions, respectively, to, their, surfaces, the, charges, result, from, four, sources, cations, held, to, the, negatively, charged, colloids, resist, being, washed, downward, by, water, and, are, out, of, reach, of, plant, roots, thereby, preserving, the, soil, fertility, in, areas, of, moderate, rainfall, and, low, temperatures, there, is, a, hierarchy, in, the, process, of, cation, exchange, on, colloids, as, cations, differ, in, the, strength, of, adsorption, by, the, colloid, and, hence, their, ability, to, replace, one, another, ion, exchange, if, present, in, equal, amounts, in, the, soil, water, solution, al, 3, replaces, h, replaces, ca, 2, replaces, mg, 2, replaces, k, same, as, nh, 4, replaces, na, if, one, cation, is, added, in, large, amounts, it, may, replace, the, others, by, the, sheer, force, of, its, numbers, this, is, called, law, of, mass, action, this, is, largely, what, occurs, with, the, addition, of, cationic, fertilisers, potash, lime, as, the, soil, solution, becomes, more, acidic, low, ph, meaning, an, abundance, of, h, the, other, cations, more, weakly, bound, to, colloids, are, pushed, into, solution, as, hydrogen, ions, occupy, exchange, sites, protonation, a, low, ph, may, cause, the, hydrogen, of, hydroxyl, groups, to, be, pulled, into, solution, leaving, charged, sites, on, the, colloid, available, to, be, occupied, by, other, cations, this, ionisation, of, hydroxy, groups, on, the, surface, of, soil, colloids, creates, what, is, described, as, ph, dependent, surface, charges, unlike, permanent, charges, developed, by, isomorphous, substitution, ph, dependent, charges, are, variable, and, increase, with, increasing, ph, freed, cations, can, be, made, available, to, plants, but, are, also, prone, to, be, leached, from, the, soil, possibly, making, the, soil, less, fertile, plants, are, able, to, excrete, h, into, the, soil, through, the, synthesis, of, organic, acids, and, by, that, means, change, the, ph, of, the, soil, near, the, root, and, push, cations, off, the, colloids, thus, making, those, available, to, the, plant, cation, exchange, capacity, is, the, soil, s, ability, to, remove, cations, from, the, soil, water, solution, and, sequester, those, to, be, exchanged, later, as, the, plant, roots, release, hydrogen, ions, to, the, solution, cec, is, the, amount, of, exchangeable, hydrogen, cation, h, that, will, combine, with, 100, grams, dry, weight, of, soil, and, whose, measure, is, one, milliequivalents, per, 100, grams, of, soil, 1, meq, 100, g, hydrogen, ions, have, a, single, charge, and, one, thousandth, of, a, gram, of, hydrogen, ions, per, 100, grams, dry, soil, gives, a, measure, of, one, milliequivalent, of, hydrogen, ion, calcium, with, an, atomic, weight, 40, times, that, of, hydrogen, and, with, a, valence, of, two, converts, to, 40, 2, 1, milliequivalent, 20, milliequivalents, of, hydrogen, ion, per, 100, grams, of, dry, soil, or, 20, meq, 100, g, the, modern, measure, of, cec, is, expressed, as, centimoles, of, positive, charge, per, kilogram, cmol, kg, of, oven, dry, soil, most, of, the, soil, s, cec, occurs, on, clay, and, humus, colloids, and, the, lack, of, those, in, hot, humid, wet, climates, such, as, tropical, rainforests, due, to, leaching, and, decomposition, respectively, explains, the, apparent, sterility, of, tropical, soils, live, plant, roots, also, have, some, cec, linked, to, their, specific, surface, area, anion, exchange, capacity, is, the, soil, s, ability, to, remove, anions, such, as, nitrate, phosphate, from, the, soil, water, solution, and, sequester, those, for, later, exchange, as, the, plant, roots, release, carbonate, anions, to, the, soil, water, solution, those, colloids, which, have, low, cec, tend, to, have, some, aec, amorphous, and, sesquioxide, clays, have, the, highest, aec, followed, by, the, iron, oxides, levels, of, aec, are, much, lower, than, for, cec, because, of, the, generally, higher, rate, of, positively, versus, negatively, charged, surfaces, on, soil, colloids, to, the, exception, of, variable, charge, soils, phosphates, tend, to, be, held, at, anion, exchange, sites, iron, and, aluminum, hydroxide, clays, are, able, to, exchange, their, hydroxide, anions, oh, for, other, anions, the, order, reflecting, the, strength, of, anion, adhesion, is, as, follows, the, amount, of, exchangeable, anions, is, of, a, magnitude, of, tenths, to, a, few, milliequivalents, per, 100, g, dry, soil, as, ph, rises, there, are, relatively, more, hydroxyls, which, will, displace, anions, from, the, colloids, and, force, them, into, solution, and, out, of, storage, hence, aec, decreases, with, increasing, ph, alkalinity, soil, reactivity, is, expressed, in, terms, of, ph, and, is, a, measure, of, the, acidity, or, alkalinity, of, the, soil, more, precisely, it, is, a, measure, of, hydronium, concentration, in, an, aqueous, solution, and, ranges, in, values, from, 0, to, 14, acidic, to, basic, but, practically, speaking, for, soils, ph, ranges, from, 3, 5, to, 9, 5, as, ph, values, beyond, those, extremes, are, toxic, to, life, forms, at, 25, c, an, aqueous, solution, that, has, a, ph, of, 3, 5, has, 10, 3, 5, moles, h, 3, o, hydronium, ions, per, litre, of, solution, and, also, 10, 10, 5, moles, per, litre, oh, a, ph, of, 7, defined, as, neutral, has, 10, 7, moles, of, hydronium, ions, per, litre, of, solution, and, also, 10, 7, moles, of, oh, per, litre, since, the, two, concentrations, are, equal, they, are, said, to, neutralise, each, other, a, ph, of, 9, 5, has, 10, 9, 5, moles, hydronium, ions, per, litre, of, solution, and, also, 10, 2, 5, moles, per, litre, oh, a, ph, of, 3, 5, has, one, million, times, more, hydronium, ions, per, litre, than, a, solution, with, ph, of, 9, 5, 9, 5, 3, 5, 6, or, 10, 6, and, is, more, acidic, the, effect, of, ph, on, a, soil, is, to, remove, from, the, soil, or, to, make, available, certain, ions, soils, with, high, acidity, tend, to, have, toxic, amounts, of, aluminium, and, manganese, as, a, result, of, a, trade, off, between, toxicity, and, requirement, most, nutrients, are, better, available, to, plants, at, moderate, ph, although, most, minerals, are, more, soluble, in, acid, soils, soil, organisms, are, hindered, by, high, acidity, and, most, agricultural, crops, do, best, with, mineral, soils, of, ph, 6, 5, and, organic, soils, of, ph, 5, 5, given, that, at, low, ph, toxic, metals, e, g, cadmium, zinc, lead, are, positively, charged, as, cations, and, organic, pollutants, are, in, non, ionic, form, thus, both, made, more, available, to, organisms, it, has, been, suggested, that, plants, animals, and, microbes, commonly, living, in, acid, soils, are, pre, adapted, to, every, kind, of, pollution, whether, of, natural, or, human, origin, in, high, rainfall, areas, soils, tend, to, acidify, as, the, basic, cations, are, forced, off, the, soil, colloids, by, the, mass, action, of, hydronium, ions, from, usual, or, unusual, rain, acidity, against, those, attached, to, the, colloids, high, rainfall, rates, can, then, wash, the, nutrients, out, leaving, the, soil, inhabited, only, by, those, organisms, which, are, particularly, efficient, to, uptake, nutrients, in, very, acid, conditions, like, in, tropical, rainforests, once, the, colloids, are, saturated, with, h, 3, o, the, addition, of, any, more, hydronium, ions, or, aluminum, hydroxyl, cations, drives, the, ph, even, lower, more, acidic, as, the, soil, has, been, left, with, no, buffering, capacity, in, areas, of, extreme, rainfall, and, high, temperatures, the, clay, and, humus, may, be, washed, out, further, reducing, the, buffering, capacity, of, the, soil, in, low, rainfall, areas, unleached, calcium, pushes, ph, to, 8, 5, and, with, the, addition, of, exchangeable, sodium, soils, may, reach, ph, 10, beyond, a, ph, of, 9, plant, growth, is, reduced, high, ph, results, in, low, micro, nutrient, mobility, but, water, soluble, chelates, of, those, nutrients, can, correct, the, deficit, sodium, can, be, reduced, by, the, addition, of, gypsum, calcium, sulphate, as, calcium, adheres, to, clay, more, tightly, than, does, sodium, causing, sodium, to, be, pushed, into, the, soil, water, solution, where, it, can, be, washed, out, by, an, abundance, of, water, there, are, acid, forming, cations, e, g, hydronium, aluminium, iron, and, there, are, base, forming, cations, e, g, calcium, magnesium, sodium, the, fraction, of, the, negatively, charged, soil, colloid, exchange, sites, cec, that, are, occupied, by, base, forming, cations, is, called, base, saturation, if, a, soil, has, a, cec, of, 20, meq, and, 5, meq, are, aluminium, and, hydronium, cations, acid, forming, the, remainder, of, positions, on, the, colloids, 20, 5, 15, meq, are, assumed, occupied, by, base, forming, cations, so, that, the, base, saturation, is, 15, 20, 100, 75, the, compliment, 25, is, assumed, acid, forming, cations, base, saturation, is, almost, in, direct, proportion, to, ph, it, increases, with, increasing, ph, it, is, of, use, in, calculating, the, amount, of, lime, needed, to, neutralise, an, acid, soil, lime, requirement, the, amount, of, lime, needed, to, neutralize, a, soil, must, take, account, of, the, amount, of, acid, forming, ions, on, the, colloids, exchangeable, acidity, not, just, those, in, the, soil, water, solution, free, acidity, the, addition, of, enough, lime, to, neutralize, the, soil, water, solution, will, be, insufficient, to, change, the, ph, as, the, acid, forming, cations, stored, on, the, soil, colloids, will, tend, to, restore, the, original, ph, condition, as, they, are, pushed, off, those, colloids, by, the, calcium, of, the, added, lime, the, resistance, of, soil, to, change, in, ph, as, a, result, of, the, addition, of, acid, or, basic, material, is, a, measure, of, the, buffering, capacity, of, a, soil, and, for, a, particular, soil, type, increases, as, the, cec, increases, hence, pure, sand, has, almost, no, buffering, ability, though, soils, high, in, colloids, whether, mineral, or, organic, have, high, buffering, capacity, buffering, occurs, by, cation, exchange, and, neutralisation, however, colloids, are, not, the, only, regulators, of, soil, ph, the, role, of, carbonates, should, be, underlined, too, more, generally, according, to, ph, levels, several, buffer, systems, take, precedence, over, each, other, from, calcium, carbonate, buffer, range, to, iron, buffer, range, the, addition, of, a, small, amount, of, highly, basic, aqueous, ammonia, to, a, soil, will, cause, the, ammonium, to, displace, hydronium, ions, from, the, colloids, and, the, end, product, is, water, and, colloidally, fixed, ammonium, but, little, permanent, change, overall, in, soil, ph, the, addition, of, a, small, amount, of, lime, ca, oh, 2, will, displace, hydronium, ions, from, the, soil, colloids, causing, the, fixation, of, calcium, to, colloids, and, the, evolution, of, co, 2, and, water, with, little, permanent, change, in, soil, ph, the, above, are, examples, of, the, buffering, of, soil, ph, the, general, principal, is, that, an, increase, in, a, particular, cation, in, the, soil, water, solution, will, cause, that, cation, to, be, fixed, to, colloids, buffered, and, a, decrease, in, solution, of, that, cation, will, cause, it, to, be, withdrawn, from, the, colloid, and, moved, into, solution, buffered, the, degree, of, buffering, is, often, related, to, the, cec, of, the, soil, the, greater, the, cec, the, greater, the, buffering, capacity, of, the, soil, soil, chemical, reactions, involve, some, combination, of, proton, and, electron, transfer, oxidation, occurs, if, there, is, a, loss, of, electrons, in, the, transfer, process, while, reduction, occurs, if, there, is, a, gain, of, electrons, reduction, potential, is, measured, in, volts, or, millivolts, soil, microbial, communities, develop, along, electron, transport, chains, forming, electrically, conductive, biofilms, and, developing, networks, of, bacterial, nanowires, redox, factors, in, soil, development, where, formation, of, redoximorphic, color, features, provides, critical, information, for, soil, interpretation, understanding, the, redox, gradient, is, important, to, managing, carbon, sequestration, bioremediation, wetland, delineation, and, soil, based, microbial, fuel, cells, seventeen, elements, or, nutrients, are, essential, for, plant, growth, and, reproduction, they, are,

and, chlorine, cl, nutrients, required, for, plants, to, complete, their, life, cycle, are, considered, essential, nutrients, nutrients, that, enhance, the, growth, of, plants, but, are, not, necessary, to, complete, the, plant, s, life, cycle, are, considered, non, essential, with, the, exception, of, carbon, hydrogen, and, oxygen, which, are, supplied, by, carbon, dioxide, and, water, and, nitrogen, provided, through, nitrogen, fixation, the, nutrients, derive, originally, from, the, mineral, component, of, the, soil, the, law, of, the, minimum, expresses, that, when, the, available, form, of, a, nutrient, is, not, in, enough, proportion, in, the, soil, solution, then, other, nutrients, cannot, be, taken, up, at, an, optimum, rate, by, a, plant, a, particular, nutrient, ratio, of, the, soil, solution, is, thus, mandatory, for, optimizing, plant, growth, a, value, which, might, differ, from, nutrient, ratios, calculated, from, plant, composition, plant, uptake, of, nutrients, can, only, proceed, when, they, are, present, in, a, plant, available, form, in, most, situations, nutrients, are, absorbed, in, an, ionic, form, from, or, together, with, soil, water, although, minerals, are, the, origin, of, most, nutrients, and, the, bulk, of, most, nutrient, elements, in, the, soil, is, held, in, crystalline, form, within, primary, and, secondary, minerals, they, weather, too, slowly, to, support, rapid, plant, growth, for, example, the, application, of, finely, ground, minerals, feldspar, and, apatite, to, soil, seldom, provides, the, necessary, amounts, of, potassium, and, phosphorus, at, a, rate, sufficient, for, good, plant, growth, as, most, of, the, nutrients, remain, bound, in, the, crystals, of, those, minerals, the, nutrients, adsorbed, onto, the, surfaces, of, clay, colloids, and, soil, organic, matter, provide, a, more, accessible, reservoir, of, many, plant, nutrients, e, g, k, ca, mg, p, zn, as, plants, absorb, the, nutrients, from, the, soil, water, the, soluble, pool, is, replenished, from, the, surface, bound, pool, the, decomposition, of, soil, organic, matter, by, microorganisms, is, another, mechanism, whereby, the, soluble, pool, of, nutrients, is, replenished, this, is, important, for, the, supply, of, plant, available, n, s, p, and, b, from, soil, gram, for, gram, the, capacity, of, humus, to, hold, nutrients, and, water, is, far, greater, than, that, of, clay, minerals, most, of, the, soil, cation, exchange, capacity, arising, from, charged, carboxylic, groups, on, organic, matter, however, despite, the, great, capacity, of, humus, to, retain, water, once, water, soaked, its, high, hydrophobicity, decreases, its, wettability, once, dry, all, in, all, small, amounts, of, humus, may, remarkably, increase, the, soil, s, capacity, to, promote, plant, growth, the, organic, material, in, soil, is, made, up, of, organic, compounds, and, includes, plant, animal, and, microbial, material, both, living, and, dead, a, typical, soil, has, a, biomass, composition, of, 70, microorganisms, 22, macrofauna, and, 8, roots, the, living, component, of, an, acre, of, soil, may, include, 900, lb, of, earthworms, 2400, lb, of, fungi, 1500, lb, of, bacteria, 133, lb, of, protozoa, and, 890, lb, of, arthropods, and, algae, a, few, percent, of, the, soil, organic, matter, with, small, residence, time, consists, of, the, microbial, biomass, and, metabolites, of, bacteria, molds, and, actinomycetes, that, work, to, break, down, the, dead, organic, matter, were, it, not, for, the, action, of, these, micro, organisms, the, entire, carbon, dioxide, part, of, the, atmosphere, would, be, sequestered, as, organic, matter, in, the, soil, however, in, the, same, time, soil, microbes, contribute, to, carbon, sequestration, in, the, topsoil, through, the, formation, of, stable, humus, in, the, aim, to, sequester, more, carbon, in, the, soil, for, alleviating, the, greenhouse, effect, it, would, be, more, efficient, in, the, long, term, to, stimulate, humification, than, to, decrease, litter, decomposition, the, main, part, of, soil, organic, matter, is, a, complex, assemblage, of, small, organic, molecules, collectively, called, humus, or, humic, substances, the, use, of, these, terms, which, do, not, rely, on, a, clear, chemical, classification, has, been, considered, as, obsolete, other, studies, showed, that, the, classical, notion, of, molecule, is, not, convenient, for, humus, which, escaped, most, attempts, done, over, two, centuries, to, resolve, it, in, unit, components, but, still, is, chemically, distinct, from, polysaccharides, lignins, and, proteins, most, living, things, in, soils, including, plants, animals, bacteria, and, fungi, are, dependent, on, organic, matter, for, nutrients, and, or, energy, soils, have, organic, compounds, in, varying, degrees, of, decomposition, the, rate, of, which, is, dependent, on, the, temperature, soil, moisture, and, aeration, bacteria, and, fungi, feed, on, the, raw, organic, matter, which, are, fed, upon, by, protozoa, which, in, turn, are, fed, upon, by, nematodes, annelids, and, arthropods, themselves, able, to, consume, and, transform, raw, or, humified, organic, matter, this, has, been, called, the, soil, food, web, through, which, all, organic, matter, is, processed, as, in, a, digestive, system, organic, matter, holds, soils, open, allowing, the, infiltration, of, air, and, water, and, may, hold, as, much, as, twice, its, weight, in, water, many, soils, including, desert, and, rocky, gravel, soils, have, little, or, no, organic, matter, soils, that, are, all, organic, matter, such, as, peat, histosols, are, infertile, in, its, earliest, stage, of, decomposition, the, original, organic, material, is, often, called, raw, organic, matter, the, final, stage, of, decomposition, is, called, humus, in, grassland, much, of, the, organic, matter, added, to, the, soil, is, from, the, deep, fibrous, grass, root, systems, by, contrast, tree, leaves, falling, on, the, forest, floor, are, the, principal, source, of, soil, organic, matter, in, the, forest, another, difference, is, the, frequent, occurrence, in, the, grasslands, of, fires, that, destroy, large, amounts, of, aboveground, material, but, stimulate, even, greater, contributions, from, roots, also, the, much, greater, acidity, under, any, forests, inhibits, the, action, of, certain, soil, organisms, that, otherwise, would, mix, much, of, the, surface, litter, into, the, mineral, soil, as, a, result, the, soils, under, grasslands, generally, develop, a, thicker, a, horizon, with, a, deeper, distribution, of, organic, matter, than, in, comparable, soils, under, forests, which, characteristically, store, most, of, their, organic, matter, in, the, forest, floor, o, horizon, and, thin, a, horizon, humus, refers, to, organic, matter, that, has, been, decomposed, by, soil, microflora, and, fauna, to, the, point, where, it, is, resistant, to, further, breakdown, humus, usually, constitutes, only, five, percent, of, the, soil, or, less, by, volume, but, it, is, an, essential, source, of, nutrients, and, adds, important, textural, qualities, crucial, to, soil, health, and, plant, growth, humus, also, feeds, arthropods, termites, and, earthworms, which, further, improve, the, soil, the, end, product, humus, is, suspended, in, colloidal, form, in, the, soil, solution, and, forms, a, weak, acid, that, can, attack, silicate, minerals, by, chelating, their, iron, and, aluminum, atoms, humus, has, a, high, cation, and, anion, exchange, capacity, that, on, a, dry, weight, basis, is, many, times, greater, than, that, of, clay, colloids, it, also, acts, as, a, buffer, like, clay, against, changes, in, ph, and, soil, moisture, humic, acids, and, fulvic, acids, which, begin, as, raw, organic, matter, are, important, constituents, of, humus, after, the, death, of, plants, animals, and, microbes, microbes, begin, to, feed, on, the, residues, through, their, production, of, extra, cellular, soil, enzymes, resulting, finally, in, the, formation, of, humus, as, the, residues, break, down, only, molecules, made, of, aliphatic, and, aromatic, hydrocarbons, assembled, and, stabilized, by, oxygen, and, hydrogen, bonds, remain, in, the, form, of, complex, molecular, assemblages, collectively, called, humus, humus, is, never, pure, in, the, soil, because, it, reacts, with, metals, and, clays, to, form, complexes, which, further, contribute, to, its, stability, and, to, soil, structure, although, the, structure, of, humus, has, in, itself, few, nutrients, with, the, exception, of, constitutive, metals, such, as, calcium, iron, and, aluminum, it, is, able, to, attract, and, link, by, weak, bonds, cation, and, anion, nutrients, that, can, further, be, released, into, the, soil, solution, in, response, to, selective, root, uptake, and, changes, in, soil, ph, a, process, of, paramount, importance, for, the, maintenance, of, fertility, in, tropical, soils, lignin, is, resistant, to, breakdown, and, accumulates, within, the, soil, it, also, reacts, with, proteins, which, further, increases, its, resistance, to, decomposition, including, enzymatic, decomposition, by, microbes, fats, and, waxes, from, plant, matter, have, still, more, resistance, to, decomposition, and, persist, in, soils, for, thousand, years, hence, their, use, as, tracers, of, past, vegetation, in, buried, soil, layers, clay, soils, often, have, higher, organic, contents, that, persist, longer, than, soils, without, clay, as, the, organic, molecules, adhere, to, and, are, stabilised, by, the, clay, proteins, normally, decompose, readily, to, the, exception, of, scleroproteins, but, when, bound, to, clay, particles, they, become, more, resistant, to, decomposition, as, for, other, proteins, clay, particles, absorb, the, enzymes, exuded, by, microbes, decreasing, enzyme, activity, while, protecting, extracellular, enzymes, from, degradation, the, addition, of, organic, matter, to, clay, soils, can, render, that, organic, matter, and, any, added, nutrients, inaccessible, to, plants, and, microbes, for, many, years, a, study, showed, increased, soil, fertility, following, the, addition, of, mature, compost, to, a, clay, soil, high, soil, tannin, content, can, cause, nitrogen, to, be, sequestered, as, resistant, tannin, protein, complexes, humus, formation, is, a, process, dependent, on, the, amount, of, plant, material, added, each, year, and, the, type, of, base, soil, both, are, affected, by, climate, and, the, type, of, organisms, present, soils, with, humus, can, vary, in, nitrogen, content, but, typically, have, 3, to, 6, percent, nitrogen, raw, organic, matter, as, a, reserve, of, nitrogen, and, phosphorus, is, a, vital, component, affecting, soil, fertility, humus, also, absorbs, water, and, expands, and, shrinks, between, dry, and, wet, states, to, a, higher, extent, than, clay, increasing, soil, porosity, humus, is, less, stable, than, the, soil, s, mineral, constituents, as, it, is, reduced, by, microbial, decomposition, and, over, time, its, concentration, diminishes, without, the, addition, of, new, organic, matter, however, humus, in, its, most, stable, forms, may, persist, over, centuries, if, not, millennia, charcoal, is, a, source, of, highly, stable, humus, called, black, carbon, which, had, been, used, traditionally, to, improve, the, fertility, of, nutrient, poor, tropical, soils, this, very, ancient, practice, as, ascertained, in, the, genesis, of, amazonian, dark, earths, has, been, renewed, and, became, popular, under, the, name, of, biochar, it, has, been, suggested, that, biochar, could, be, used, to, sequester, more, carbon, in, the, fight, against, the, greenhouse, effect, the, production, accumulation, and, degradation, of, organic, matter, are, greatly, dependent, on, climate, for, example, when, a, thawing, event, occurs, the, flux, of, soil, gases, with, atmospheric, gases, is, significantly, influenced, temperature, soil, moisture, and, topography, are, the, major, factors, affecting, the, accumulation, of, organic, matter, in, soils, organic, matter, tends, to, accumulate, under, wet, or, cold, conditions, where, decomposer, activity, is, impeded, by, low, temperature, or, excess, moisture, which, results, in, anaerobic, conditions, conversely, excessive, rain, and, high, temperatures, of, tropical, climates, enables, rapid, decomposition, of, organic, matter, and, leaching, of, plant, nutrients, forest, ecosystems, on, these, soils, rely, on, efficient, recycling, of, nutrients, and, plant, matter, by, the, living, plant, and, microbial, biomass, to, maintain, their, productivity, a, process, which, is, disturbed, by, human, activities, excessive, slope, in, particular, in, the, presence, of, cultivation, for, the, sake, of, agriculture, may, encourage, the, erosion, of, the, top, layer, of, soil, which, holds, most, of, the, raw, organic, material, that, would, otherwise, eventually, become, humus, typical, types, and, percentages, of, plant, residue, components, cellulose, and, hemicellulose, undergo, fast, decomposition, by, fungi, and, bacteria, with, a, half, life, of, 12, 18, days, in, a, temperate, climate, brown, rot, fungi, can, decompose, the, cellulose, and, hemicellulose, leaving, the, lignin, and, phenolic, compounds, behind, starch, which, is, an, energy, storage, system, for, plants, undergoes, fast, decomposition, by, bacteria, and, fungi, lignin, consists, of, polymers, composed, of, 500, to, 600, units, with, a, highly, branched, amorphous, structure, linked, to, cellulose, hemicellulose, and, pectin, in, plant, cell, walls, lignin, undergoes, very, slow, decomposition, mainly, by, white, rot, fungi, and, actinomycetes, its, half, life, under, temperate, conditions, is, about, six, months, a, horizontal, layer, of, the, soil, whose, physical, features, composition, and, age, are, distinct, from, those, above, and, beneath, is, referred, to, as, a, soil, horizon, the, naming, of, a, horizon, is, based, on, the, type, of, material, of, which, it, is, composed, those, materials, reflect, the, duration, of, specific, processes, of, soil, formation, they, are, labelled, using, a, shorthand, notation, of, letters, and, numbers, which, describe, the, horizon, in, terms, of, its, colour, size, texture, structure, consistency, root, quantity, ph, voids, boundary, characteristics, and, presence, of, nodules, or, concretions, no, soil, profile, has, all, the, major, horizons, some, called, entisols, may, have, only, one, horizon, or, are, currently, considered, as, having, no, horizon, in, particular, incipient, soils, from, unreclaimed, mining, waste, deposits, moraines, volcanic, cones, sand, dunes, or, alluvial, terraces, upper, soil, horizons, may, be, lacking, in, truncated, soils, following, wind, or, water, ablation, with, concomitant, downslope, burying, of, soil, horizons, a, natural, process, aggravated, by, agricultural, practices, such, as, tillage, the, growth, of, trees, is, another, source, of, disturbance, creating, a, micro, scale, heterogeneity, which, is, still, visible, in, soil, horizons, once, trees, have, died, by, passing, from, a, horizon, to, another, from, the, top, to, the, bottom, of, the, soil, profile, one, goes, back, in, time, with, past, events, registered, in, soil, horizons, like, in, sediment, layers, sampling, pollen, testate, amoebae, and, plant, remains, in, soil, horizons, may, help, to, reveal, environmental, changes, e, g, climate, change, land, use, change, which, occurred, in, the, course, of, soil, formation, soil, horizons, can, be, dated, by, several, methods, such, as, radiocarbon, using, pieces, of, charcoal, provided, they, are, of, enough, size, to, escape, pedoturbation, by, earthworm, activity, and, other, mechanical, disturbances, fossil, soil, horizons, from, paleosols, can, be, found, within, sedimentary, rock, sequences, allowing, the, study, of, past, environments, the, exposure, of, parent, material, to, favourable, conditions, produces, mineral, soils, that, are, marginally, suitable, for, plant, growth, as, is, the, case, in, eroded, soils, the, growth, of, vegetation, results, in, the, production, of, organic, residues, which, fall, on, the, ground, as, litter, for, plant, aerial, parts, leaf, litter, or, are, directly, produced, belowground, for, subterranean, plant, organs, root, litter, and, then, release, dissolved, organic, matter, the, remaining, surficial, organic, layer, called, the, o, horizon, produces, a, more, active, soil, due, to, the, effect, of, the, organisms, that, live, within, it, organisms, colonise, and, break, down, organic, materials, making, available, nutrients, upon, which, other, plants, and, animals, can, live, after, sufficient, time, humus, moves, downward, and, is, deposited, in, a, distinctive, organic, mineral, surface, layer, called, the, a, horizon, in, which, organic, matter, is, mixed, with, mineral, matter, through, the, activity, of, burrowing, animals, a, process, called, pedoturbation, this, natural, process, does, not, go, to, completion, in, the, presence, of, conditions, detrimental, to, soil, life, such, as, strong, acidity, cold, climate, or, pollution, stemming, in, the, accumulation, of, undecomposed, organic, matter, within, a, single, organic, horizon, overlying, the, mineral, soil, and, in, the, juxtaposition, of, humified, organic, matter, and, mineral, particles, without, intimate, mixing, in, the, underlying, mineral, horizons, one, of, the, first, soil, classification, systems, was, developed, by, russian, scientist, vasily, dokuchaev, around, 1880, it, was, modified, a, number, of, times, by, american, and, european, researchers, and, was, developed, into, the, system, commonly, used, until, the, 1960s, it, was, based, on, the, idea, that, soils, have, a, particular, morphology, based, on, the, materials, and, factors, that, form, them, in, the, 1960s, a, different, classification, system, began, to, emerge, which, focused, on, soil, morphology, instead, of, parental, materials, and, soil, forming, factors, since, then, it, has, undergone, further, modifications, the, world, reference, base, for, soil, resources, aims, to, establish, an, international, reference, base, for, soil, classification, soil, is, used, in, agriculture, where, it, serves, as, the, anchor, and, primary, nutrient, base, for, plants, the, types, of, soil, and, available, moisture, determine, the, species, of, plants, that, can, be, cultivated, agricultural, soil, science, was, the, primeval, domain, of, soil, knowledge, long, time, before, the, advent, of, pedology, in, the, 19th, century, however, as, demonstrated, by, aeroponics, aquaponics, and, hydroponics, soil, material, is, not, an, absolute, essential, for, agriculture, and, soilless, cropping, systems, have, been, claimed, as, the, future, of, agriculture, for, an, endless, growing, mankind, soil, material, is, also, a, critical, component, in, mining, construction, and, landscape, development, industries, soil, serves, as, a, foundation, for, most, construction, projects, the, movement, of, massive, volumes, of, soil, can, be, involved, in, surface, mining, road, building, and, dam, construction, earth, sheltering, is, the, architectural, practice, of, using, soil, for, external, thermal, mass, against, building, walls, many, building, materials, are, soil, based, loss, of, soil, through, urbanization, is, growing, at, a, high, rate, in, many, areas, and, can, be, critical, for, the, maintenance, of, subsistence, agriculture, soil, resources, are, critical, to, the, environment, as, well, as, to, food, and, fibre, production,

releases, it, later, thus, preventing, floods, and, drought, flood, regulation, being, one, of, the, major, ecosystem, services, provided, by, soil, soil, cleans, water, as, it, percolates, through, it, soil, is, the, habitat, for, many, organisms, the, major, part, of, known, and, unknown, biodiversity, is, in, the, soil, in, the, form, of, earthworms, woodlice, millipedes, centipedes, snails, slugs, mites, springtails, enchytraeids, nematodes, protists, bacteria, archaea, fungi, and, algae, and, most, organisms, living, above, ground, have, part, of, them, plants, or, spend, part, of, their, life, cycle, insects, below, ground, above, ground, and, below, ground, biodiversities, are, tightly, interconnected, making, soil, protection, of, paramount, importance, for, any, restoration, or, conservation, plan, the, biological, component, of, soil, is, an, extremely, important, carbon, sink, since, about, 57, of, the, biotic, content, is, carbon, even, in, deserts, cyanobacteria, lichens, and, mosses, form, biological, soil, crusts, which, capture, and, sequester, a, significant, amount, of, carbon, by, photosynthesis, poor, farming, and, grazing, methods, have, degraded, soils, and, released, much, of, this, sequestered, carbon, to, the, atmosphere, restoring, the, world, s, soils, could, offset, the, effect, of, increases, in, greenhouse, gas, emissions, and, slow,

is, not, soil, biological, processes, taking, place, during, composting, are, similar, to, those, occurring, during, decomposition, and, humification, of, soil, organic, matter, organic, soils, especially, peat, serve, as, a, significant, fuel, and, horticultural, resource, peat, soils, are, also, commonly, used, for, the, sake, of, agriculture, in, nordic, countries, because, peatland, sites, when, drained, provide, fertile, soils, for, food, production, however, wide, areas, of, peat, production, such, as, rain, fed, sphagnum, bogs, also, called, blanket, bogs, or, raised, bogs, are, now, protected, because, of, their, patrimonial, interest, as, an, example, flow, country, covering, 4, 000, square, kilometres, of, rolling, expanse, of, blanket, bogs, in, scotland, is, now, candidate, for, being, included, in, the, world, heritage, list, under, present, day, global, warming, peat, soils, are, thought, to, be, involved, in, a, self, reinforcing, positive, feedback, process, of, increased, emission, of, greenhouse, gases, methane, and, carbon, dioxide, and, increased, temperature, a, contention, which, is, still, under, debate, when, replaced, at, field, scale, and, including, stimulated, plant, growth, geophagy, is, the, practice, of, eating, soil, like, substances, both, animals, and, humans, occasionally, consume, soil, for, medicinal, recreational, or, religious, purposes, it, has, been, shown, that, some, monkeys, consume, soil, together, with, their, preferred, food, tree, foliage, and, fruits, in, order, to, alleviate, tannin, toxicity, soils, filter, and, purify, water, and, affect, its, chemistry, rain, water, and, pooled, water, from, ponds, lakes, and, rivers, percolate, through, the, soil, horizons, and, the, upper, rock, strata, thus, becoming, groundwater, pests, viruses, and, pollutants, such, as, persistent, organic, pollutants, chlorinated, pesticides, polychlorinated, biphenyls, oils, hydrocarbons, heavy, metals, lead, zinc, cadmium, and, excess, nutrients, nitrates, sulfates, phosphates, are, filtered, out, by, the, soil, soil, organisms, metabolise, them, or, immobilise, them, in, their, biomass, and, necromass, thereby, incorporating, them, into, stable, humus, the, physical, integrity, of, soil, is, also, a, prerequisite, for, avoiding, landslides, in, rugged, landscapes, land, degradation, is, a, human, induced, or, natural, process, which, impairs, the, capacity, of, land, to, function, soil, degradation, involves, acidification, contamination, desertification, erosion, or, salination, soil, acidification, is, beneficial, in, the, case, of, alkaline, soils, but, it, degrades, land, when, it, lowers, crop, productivity, soil, biological, activity, and, increases, soil, vulnerability, to, contamination, and, erosion, soils, are, initially, acid, and, remain, such, when, their, parent, materials, are, low, in, basic, cations, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and, sodium, on, parent, materials, richer, in, weatherable, minerals, acidification, occurs, when, basic, cations, are, leached, from, the, soil, profile, by, rainfall, or, exported, by, the, harvesting, of, forest, or, agricultural, crops, soil, acidification, is, accelerated, by, the, use, of, acid, forming, nitrogenous, fertilizers, and, by, the, effects, of, acid, precipitation, deforestation, is, another, cause, of, soil, acidification, mediated, by, increased, leaching, of, soil, nutrients, in, the, absence, of, tree, canopies, soil, contamination, at, low, levels, is, often, within, a, soil, s, capacity, to, treat, and, assimilate, waste, material, soil, biota, can, treat, waste, by, transforming, it, mainly, through, microbial, enzymatic, activity, soil, organic, matter, and, soil, minerals, can, adsorb, the, waste, material, and, decrease, its, toxicity, although, when, in, colloidal, form, they, may, transport, the, adsorbed, contaminants, to, subsurface, environments, many, waste,

industrial, contamination, or, other, development, activity, damages, the, soil, to, such, a, degree, that, the, land, cannot, be, used, safely, or, productively, remediation, of, derelict, soil, uses, principles, of, geology, physics, chemistry, and, biology, to, degrade, attenuate, isolate, or, remove, soil, contaminants, to, restore, soil, functions, and, values, techniques, include, leaching, air, sparging, soil, conditioners, phytoremediation, bioremediation, and, monitored, natural, attenuation, an, example, of, diffuse, pollution, with, contaminants, is, copper, accumulation, in, vineyards, and, orchards, to, which, fungicides, are, repeatedly, applied, even, in, organic, farming, microfibres, from, synthetic, textiles, are, another, type, of, plastic, soil, contamination, 100, of, agricultural, soil, samples, from, southwestern, china, contained, plastic, particles, 92, of, which, were, microfibres, sources, of, microfibres, likely, included, string, or, twine, as, well, as, irrigation, water, in, which, clothes, had, been, washed, the, application, of, biosolids, from, sewage, sludge, and, compost, can, introduce, microplastics, to, soils, this, adds, to, the, burden, of, microplastics, from, other, sources, e, g, the, atmosphere, approximately, half, the, sewage, sludge, in, europe, and, north, america, is, applied, to, agricultural, land, in, europe, it, has, been, estimated, that, for, every, million, inhabitants, 113, to, 770, tonnes, of, microplastics, are, added, to, agricultural, soils, each, year, desertification, an, environmental, process, of, ecosystem, degradation, in, arid, and, semi, arid, regions, is, often, caused, by, badly, adapted, human, activities, such, as, overgrazing, or, excess, harvesting, of, firewood, it, is, a, common, misconception, that, drought, causes, desertification, droughts, are, common, in, arid, and, semiarid, lands, well, managed, lands, can, recover, from, drought, when, the, rains, return, soil, management, tools, include, maintaining, soil, nutrient, and, organic, matter, levels, reduced, tillage, and, increased, cover, these, practices, help, to, control, erosion, and, maintain, productivity, during, periods, when, moisture, is, available, continued, land, abuse, during, droughts, however, increases, land, degradation, increased, population, and, livestock, pressure, on, marginal, lands, accelerates, desertification, it, is, now, questioned, whether, present, day, climate, warming, will, favour, or, disfavour, desertification, with, contradictory, reports, about, predicted, rainfall, trends, associated, with, increased, temperature, and, strong, discrepancies, among, regions, even, in, the, same, country, erosion, of, soil, is, caused, by, water, wind, ice, and, movement, in, response, to, gravity, more, than, one, kind, of, erosion, can, occur, simultaneously, erosion, is, distinguished, from, weathering, since, erosion, also, transports, eroded, soil, away, from, its, place, of, origin, soil, in, transit, may, be, described, as, sediment, erosion, is, an, intrinsic, natural, process, but, in, many, places, it, is, greatly, increased, by, human, activity, especially, unsuitable, land, use, practices, these, include, agricultural, activities, which, leave, the, soil, bare, during, times, of, heavy, rain, or, strong, winds, overgrazing, deforestation, and, improper, construction, activity, improved, management, can, limit, erosion, soil, conservation, techniques, which, are, employed, include, changes, of, land, use, such, as, replacing, erosion, prone, crops, with, grass, or, other, soil, binding, plants, changes, to, the, timing, or, type, of, agricultural, operations, terrace, building, use, of, erosion, suppressing, cover, materials, including, cover, crops, and, other, plants, limiting, disturbance, during, construction, and, avoiding, construction, during, erosion, prone, periods, and, in, erosion, prone, places, such, as, steep, slopes, historically, one, of, the, best, examples, of, large, scale, soil, erosion, due, to, unsuitable, land, use, practices, is, wind, erosion, the, so, called, dust, bowl, which, ruined, american, and, canadian, prairies, during, the, 1930s, when, immigrant, farmers, encouraged, by, the, federal, government, of, both, countries, settled, and, converted, the, original, shortgrass, prairie, to, agricultural, crops, and, cattle, ranching, a, serious, and, long, running, water, erosion, problem, occurs, in, china, on, the, middle, reaches, of, the, yellow, river, and, the, upper, reaches, of, the, yangtze, river, from, the, yellow, river, over, 1, 6, billion, tons, of, sediment, flow, each, year, into, the, ocean, the, sediment, originates, primarily, from, water, erosion, gully, erosion, in, the, loess, plateau, region, of, northwest, china, soil, piping, is, a, particular, form, of, soil, erosion, that, occurs, below, the, soil, surface, it, causes, levee, and, dam, failure, as, well, as, sink, hole, formation, turbulent, flow, removes, soil, starting, at, the, mouth, of, the, seep, flow, and, the, subsoil, erosion, advances, up, gradient, the, term, sand, boil, is, used, to, describe, the, appearance, of, the, discharging, end, of, an, active, soil, pipe, soil, salination, is, the, accumulation, of, free, salts, to, such, an, extent, that, it, leads, to, degradation, of, the, agricultural, value, of, soils, and, vegetation, consequences, include, corrosion, damage, reduced, plant, growth, erosion, due, to, loss, of, plant, cover, and, soil, structure, and, water, quality, problems, due, to, sedimentation, salination, occurs, due, to, a, combination, of, natural, and, human, caused, processes, arid, conditions, favour, salt, accumulation, this, is, especially, apparent, when, soil, parent, material, is, saline, irrigation, of, arid, lands, is, especially, problematic, all, irrigation, water, has, some, level, of, salinity, irrigation, especially, when, it, involves, leakage, from, canals, and, overirrigation, in, the, field, often, raises, the, underlying, water, table, rapid, salination, occurs, when, the, land, surface, is, within, the, capillary, fringe, of, saline, groundwater, soil, salinity, control, involves, watertable, control, and, flushing, with, higher, levels, of, applied, water, in, combination, with, tile, drainage, or, another, form, of, subsurface, drainage, soils, which, contain, high, levels, of, particular, clays, with, high, swelling, properties, such, as, smectites, are, often, very, fertile, for, example, the, smectite, rich, paddy, soils, of, thailand, s, central, plains, are, among, the, most, productive, in, the, world, however, the, overuse, of, mineral, nitrogen, fertilizers, and, pesticides, in, irrigated, intensive, rice, production, has, endangered, these, soils, forcing, farmers, to, implement, integrated, practices, based, on, cost, reduction, operating, principles, many, farmers, in, tropical, areas, however, struggle, to, retain, organic, matter, and, clay, in, the, soils, they, work, in, recent, years, for, example, productivity, has, declined, and, soil, erosion, has, increased, in, the, low, clay, soils, of, northern, thailand, following, the, abandonment, of, shifting, cultivation, for, a, more, permanent, land, use, farmers, initially, responded, by, adding, organic, matter, and, clay, from, termite, mound, material, but, this, was, unsustainable, in, the, long, term, because, of, rarefaction, of, termite, mounds, scientists, experimented, with, adding, bentonite, one, of, the, smectite, family, of, clays, to, the, soil, in, field, trials, conducted, by, scientists, from, the, international, water, management, institute, iwmi, in, cooperation, with, khon, kaen, university, and, local, farmers, this, had, the, effect, of, helping, retain, water, and, nutrients, supplementing, the, farmer, s, usual, practice, with, a, single, application, of, 200, kilograms, per, rai, 1, 300, kg, ha, 1, 100, lb, acre, of, bentonite, resulted, in, an, average, yield, increase, of, 73, other, studies, showed, that, applying, bentonite, to, degraded, sandy, soils, reduced, the, risk, of, crop, failure, during, drought, years, in, 2008, three, years, after, the, initial, trials, iwmi, scientists, conducted, a, survey, among, 250, farmers, in, northeast, thailand, half, of, whom, had, applied, bentonite, to, their, fields, the, average, improvement, for, those, using, the, clay, addition, was, 18, higher, than, for, non, clay, users, using, the, clay, had, enabled, some, farmers, to, switch, to, growing, vegetables, which, need, more, fertile, soil, this, helped, to, increase, their, income, the, researchers, estimated, that, 200, farmers, in, northeast, thailand, and, 400, in, cambodia, had, adopted, the, use, of, clays, and, that, a, further, 20, 000, farmers, were, introduced, to, the, new, technique, if, the, soil, is, too, high, in, clay, or, salts, e, g, saline, sodic, soil, adding, gypsum, washed, river, sand, and, organic, matter, e, g, municipal, solid, waste, will, balance, the, composition, adding, organic, matter, like, ramial, chipped, wood, or, compost, to, soil, which, is, depleted, in, nutrients, and, too, high, in, sand, will, boost, its, quality, and, improve, production, special, mention, must, be, made, of, the, use, of, charcoal, and, more, generally, biochar, to, improve, nutrient, poor, tropical, soils, a, process, based, on, the, higher, fertility, of, anthropogenic, pre, columbian, amazonian, dark, earths, also, called, terra, preta, de, ndio, due, to, interesting, physical, and, chemical, properties, of, soil, black, carbon, as, a, source, of, stable, humus, however, the, uncontrolled, application, of, charred, waste, products, of, all, kinds, may, endanger, soil, life, and, human, health, the, history, of, the, study, of, soil, is, intimately, tied, to, humans, urgent, need, to, provide, food, for, themselves, and, forage, for, their, animals, throughout, history, civilizations, have, prospered, or, declined, as, a, function, of, the, availability, and, productivity, of, their, soils, the, greek, historian, xenophon, 450, 355, bce, was, the, first, to, expound, upon, the, merits, of, green, manuring, crops, but, then, whatever, weeds, are, upon, the, ground, being, turned, into, earth, enrich, the, soil, as, much, as, dung, columella, s, of, husbandry, circa, 60, ce, advocated, the, use, of, lime, and, that, clover, and, alfalfa, green, manure, should, be, turned, under, and, was, used, by, 15, generations, 450, years, under, the, roman, empire, until, its, collapse, from, the, fall, of, rome, to, the, french, revolution, knowledge, of, soil, and, agriculture, was, passed, on, from, parent, to, child, and, as, a, result, crop, yields, were, low, during, the, european, middle, ages, yahya, ibn, al, awwam, s, handbook, with, its, emphasis, on, irrigation, guided, the, people, of, north, africa, spain, and, the, middle, east, a, translation, of, this, work, was, finally, carried, to, the, southwest, of, the, united, states, when, under, spanish, influence, olivier, de, serres, considered, the, father, of, french, agronomy, was, the, first, to, suggest, the, abandonment, of, fallowing, and, its, replacement, by, hay, meadows, within, crop, rotations, he, also, highlighted, the, importance, of, soil, the, french, terroir, in, the, management, of, vineyards, his, famous, book, le, th, tre, d, agriculture, et, mesnage, des, champs, contributed, to, the, rise, of, modern, sustainable, agriculture, and, to, the, collapse, of, old, agricultural, practices, such, as, soil, amendment, for, crops, by, the, lifting, of, forest, litter, and, assarting, which, ruined, the, soils, of, western, europe, during, the, middle, ages, and, even, later, on, according, to, regions, experiments, into, what, made, plants, grow, first, led, to, the, idea, that, the, ash, left, behind, when, plant, matter, was, burned, was, the, essential, element, but, overlooked, the, role, of, nitrogen, which, is, not, left, on, the, ground, after, combustion, a, belief, which, prevailed, until, the, 19th, century, in, about, 1635, the, flemish, chemist, jan, baptist, van, helmont, thought, he, had, proved, water, to, be, the, essential, element, from, his, famous, five, years, experiment, with, a, willow, tree, grown, with, only, the, addition, of, rainwater, his, conclusion, came, from, the, fact, that, the, increase, in, the, plant, s, weight, had, apparently, been, produced, only, by, the, addition, of, water, with, no, reduction, in, the, soil, s, weight, john, woodward, d, 1728, experimented, with, various, types, of, water, ranging, from, clean, to, muddy, and, found, muddy, water, the, best, and, so, he, concluded, that, earthy, matter, was, the, essential, element, others, concluded, it, was, humus, in, the, soil, that, passed, some, essence, to, the, growing, plant, still, others, held, that, the, vital, growth, principal, was, something, passed, from, dead, plants, or, animals, to, the, new, plants, at, the, start, of, the, 18th, century, jethro, tull, demonstrated, that, it, was, beneficial, to, cultivate, stir, the, soil, but, his, opinion, that, the, stirring, made, the, fine, parts, of, soil, available, for, plant, absorption, was, erroneous, as, chemistry, developed, it, was, applied, to, the, investigation, of, soil, fertility, the, french, chemist, antoine, lavoisier, showed, in, about, 1778, that, plants, and, animals, must, combust, oxygen, internally, to, live, he, was, able, to, deduce, that, most, of, the, 165, pound, 75, kg, weight, of, van, helmont, s, willow, tree, derived, from, air, it, was, the, french, agriculturalist, jean, baptiste, boussingault, who, by, means, of, experimentation, obtained, evidence, showing, that, the, main, sources, of, carbon, hydrogen, and, oxygen, for, plants, were, air, and, water, while, nitrogen, was, taken, from, soil, justus, von, liebig, in, his, book, organic, chemistry, in, its, applications, to, agriculture, and, physiology, published, 1840, asserted, that, the, chemicals, in, plants, must, have, come, from, the, soil, and, air, and, that, to, maintain, soil, fertility, the, used, minerals, must, be, replaced, liebig, nevertheless, believed, the, nitrogen, was, supplied, from, the, air, the, enrichment, of, soil, with, guano, by, the, incas, was, rediscovered, in, 1802, by, alexander, von, humboldt, this, led, to, its, mining, and, that, of, chilean, nitrate, and, to, its, application, to, soil, in, the, united, states, and, europe, after, 1840, the, work, of, liebig, was, a, revolution, for, agriculture, and, so, other, investigators, started, experimentation, based, on, it, in, england, john, bennet, lawes, and, joseph, henry, gilbert, worked, in, the, rothamsted, experimental, station, founded, by, the, former, and, re, discovered, that, plants, took, nitrogen, from, the, soil, and, that, salts, needed, to, be, in, an, available, state, to, be, absorbed, by, plants, their, investigations, also, produced, the, superphosphate, consisting, in, the, acid, treatment, of, phosphate, rock, this, led, to, the, invention, and, use, of, salts, of, potassium, k, and, nitrogen, n, as, fertilizers, ammonia, generated, by, the, production, of, coke, was, recovered, and, used, as, fertiliser, finally, the, chemical, basis, of, nutrients, delivered, to, the, soil, in, manure, was, understood, and, in, the, mid, 19th, century, chemical, fertilisers, were, applied, however, the, dynamic, interaction, of, soil, and, its, life, forms, was, still, not, understood, in, 1856, j, thomas, way, discovered, that, ammonia, contained, in, fertilisers, was, transformed, into, nitrates, and, twenty, years, later, robert, warington, proved, that, this, transformation, was, done, by, living, organisms, in, 1890, sergei, winogradsky, announced, he, had, found, the, bacteria, responsible, for, this, transformation, it, was, known, that, certain, legumes, could, take, up, nitrogen, from, the, air, and, fix, it, to, the, soil, but, it, took, the, development, of, bacteriology, towards, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, to, lead, to, an, understanding, of, the, role, played, in, nitrogen, fixation, by, bacteria, the, symbiosis, of, bacteria, and, leguminous, roots, and, the, fixation, of, nitrogen, by, the, bacteria, were, simultaneously, discovered, by, the, german, agronomist, hermann, hellriegel, and, the, dutch, microbiologist, martinus, beijerinck, crop, rotation, mechanisation, chemical, and, natural, fertilisers, led, to, a, doubling, of, wheat, yields, in, western, europe, between, 1800, and, 1900, the, scientists, who, studied, the, soil, in, connection, with, agricultural, practices, had, considered, it, mainly, as, a, static, substrate, however, soil, is, the, result, of, evolution, from, more, ancient, geological, materials, under, the, action, of, biotic, and, abiotic, processes, after, studies, of, the, improvement, of, the, soil, commenced, other, researchers, began, to, study, soil, genesis, and, as, a, result, also, soil, types, and, classifications, in, 1860, while, in, mississippi, eugene, w, hilgard, 1833, 1916, studied, the, relationship, between, rock, material, climate, vegetation, and, the, type, of, soils, that, were, developed, he, realised, that, the, soils, were, dynamic, and, considered, the, classification,
