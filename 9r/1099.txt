in, physics, resonance, refers, to, a, wide, class, of, phenomena, that, arise, as, a, result, of, matching, temporal, or, spatial, periods, of, oscillatory, objects, for, an, oscillatory, dynamical, system, driven, by, a, time, varying, external, force, resonance, occurs, when, the, frequency, of, the, external, force, coincides, with, the, natural, frequency, of, the, system, resonance, can, occur, in, various, systems, such, as, mechanical, electrical, or, acoustic, systems, and, it, is, desirable, in, certain, applications, such, as, musical, instruments, or, radio, receivers, resonance, can, also, be, undesirable, leading, to, excessive, vibrations, or, even, structural, failure, in, some, cases, all, systems, including, molecular, systems, and, particles, tend, to, vibrate, at, a, natural, frequency, depending, upon, their, structure, this, frequency, is, known, as, a, resonant, frequency, or, resonance, frequency, when, an, oscillating, force, an, external, vibration, is, applied, at, a, resonant, frequency, of, a, dynamic, system, object, or, particle, the, outside, vibration, will, cause, the, system, to, oscillate, at, a, higher, amplitude, with, more, force, than, when, the, same, force, is, applied, at, other, non, resonant, frequencies, the, resonant, frequencies, of, a, system, can, be, identified, when, the, response, to, an, external, vibration, creates, an, amplitude, that, is, a, relative, maximum, within, the, system, small, periodic, forces, that, are, near, a, resonant, frequency, of, the, system, have, the, ability, to, produce, large, amplitude, oscillations, in, the, system, due, to, the, storage, of, vibrational, energy, resonance, phenomena, occur, with, all, types, of, vibrations, or, waves, there, is, mechanical, resonance, orbital, resonance, acoustic, resonance, electromagnetic, resonance, nuclear, magnetic, resonance, nmr, electron, spin, resonance, esr, and, resonance, of, quantum, wave, functions, resonant, systems, can, be, used, to, generate, vibrations, of, a, specific, frequency, e, g, musical, instruments, or, pick, out, specific, frequencies, from, a, complex, vibration, containing, many, frequencies, e, g, filters, the, term, resonance, from, latin, resonantia, echo, from, resonare, resound, originated, from, the, field, of, acoustics, particularly, the, sympathetic, resonance, observed, in, musical, instruments, e, g, when, one, string, starts, to, vibrate, and, produce, sound, after, a, different, one, is, struck, resonance, occurs, when, a, system, is, able, to, store, and, easily, transfer, energy, between, two, or, more, different, storage, modes, such, as, kinetic, energy, and, potential, energy, in, the, case, of, a, simple, pendulum, however, there, are, some, losses, from, cycle, to, cycle, called, damping, when, damping, is, small, the, resonant, frequency, is, approximately, equal, to, the, natural, frequency, of, the, system, which, is, a, frequency, of, unforced, vibrations, some, systems, have, multiple, distinct, resonant, frequencies, a, familiar, example, is, a, playground, swing, which, acts, as, a, pendulum, pushing, a, person, in, a, swing, in, time, with, the, natural, interval, of, the, swing, its, resonant, frequency, makes, the, swing, go, higher, and, higher, maximum, amplitude, while, attempts, to, push, the, swing, at, a, faster, or, slower, tempo, produce, smaller, arcs, p, 2, 24, this, is, because, the, energy, the, swing, absorbs, is, maximized, when, the, pushes, match, the, swing, s, natural, oscillations, resonance, occurs, widely, in, nature, and, is, exploited, in, many, devices, it, is, the, mechanism, by, which, virtually, all, sinusoidal, waves, and, vibrations, are, generated, for, example, when, hard, objects, like, metal, glass, or, wood, are, struck, there, are, brief, resonant, vibrations, in, the, object, p, 2, 24, light, and, other, short, wavelength, electromagnetic, radiation, is, produced, by, resonance, on, an, atomic, scale, such, as, electrons, in, atoms, other, examples, of, resonance, include, resonance, manifests, itself, in, many, linear, and, nonlinear, systems, as, oscillations, around, an, equilibrium, point, when, the, system, is, driven, by, a, sinusoidal, external, input, a, measured, output, of, the, system, may, oscillate, in, response, the, ratio, of, the, amplitude, of, the, output, s, steady, state, oscillations, to, the, input, s, oscillations, is, called, the, gain, and, the, gain, can, be, a, function, of, the, frequency, of, the, sinusoidal, external, input, peaks, in, the, gain, at, certain, frequencies, correspond, to, resonances, where, the, amplitude, of, the, measured, output, s, oscillations, are, disproportionately, large, since, many, linear, and, nonlinear, systems, that, oscillate, are, modeled, as, harmonic, oscillators, near, their, equilibria, a, derivation, of, the, resonant, frequency, for, a, driven, damped, harmonic, oscillator, is, shown, an, rlc, circuit, is, used, to, illustrate, connections, between, resonance, and, a, system, s, transfer, function, frequency, response, poles, and, zeroes, building, off, the, rlc, circuit, example, these, connections, for, higher, order, linear, systems, with, multiple, inputs, and, outputs, are, generalized, consider, a, damped, mass, on, a, spring, driven, by, a, sinusoidal, externally, applied, force, newton, s, second, law, takes, the, form, where, m, is, the, mass, x, is, the, displacement, of, the, mass, from, the, equilibrium, point, f, 0, is, the, driving, amplitude, is, the, driving, angular, frequency, k, is, the, spring, constant, and, c, is, the, viscous, damping, coefficient, this, can, be, rewritten, in, the, form, where, many, sources, also, refer, to, 0, as, the, resonant, frequency, however, as, shown, below, when, analyzing, oscillations, of, the, displacement, x, t, the, resonant, frequency, is, close, to, but, not, the, same, as, 0, in, general, the, resonant, frequency, is, close, to, but, not, necessarily, the, same, as, the, natural, frequency, the, rlc, circuit, example, in, the, next, section, gives, examples, of, different, resonant, frequencies, for, the, same, system, the, general, solution, of, equation, 2, is, the, sum, of, a, transient, solution, that, depends, on, initial, conditions, and, a, steady, state, solution, that, is, independent, of, initial, conditions, and, depends, only, on, the, driving, amplitude, f, 0, driving, frequency, undamped, angular, frequency, 0, and, the, damping, ratio, the, transient, solution, decays, in, a, relatively, short, amount, of, time, so, to, study, resonance, it, is, sufficient, to, consider, the, steady, state, solution, it, is, possible, to, write, the, steady, state, solution, for, x, t, as, a, function, proportional, to, the, driving, force, with, an, induced, phase, change, where, arctan, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, n, displaystyle, varphi, arctan, left, frac, 2, omega, omega, 0, zeta, omega, 2, omega, 0, 2, right, n, pi, the, phase, value, is, usually, taken, to, be, between, 180, and, 0, so, it, represents, a, phase, lag, for, both, positive, and, negative, values, of, the, arctan, argument, resonance, occurs, when, at, certain, driving, frequencies, the, steady, state, amplitude, of, x, t, is, large, compared, to, its, amplitude, at, other, driving, frequencies, for, the, mass, on, a, spring, resonance, corresponds, physically, to, the, mass, s, oscillations, having, large, displacements, from, the, spring, s, equilibrium, position, at, certain, driving, frequencies, looking, at, the, amplitude, of, x, t, as, a, function, of, the, driving, frequency, the, amplitude, is, maximal, at, the, driving, frequency, r, 0, 1, 2, 2, displaystyle, omega, r, omega, 0, sqrt, 1, 2, zeta, 2, r, is, the, resonant, frequency, for, this, system, again, the, resonant, frequency, does, not, equal, the, undamped, angular, frequency, 0, of, the, oscillator, they, are, proportional, and, if, the, damping, ratio, goes, to, zero, they, are, the, same, but, for, non, zero, damping, they, are, not, the, same, frequency, as, shown, in, the, figure, resonance, may, also, occur, at, other, frequencies, near, the, resonant, frequency, including, 0, but, the, maximum, response, is, at, the, resonant, frequency, also, r, is, only, real, and, non, zero, if, 1, 2, textstyle, zeta, 1, sqrt, 2, so, this, system, can, only, resonate, when, the, harmonic, oscillator, is, significantly, underdamped, for, systems, with, a, very, small, damping, ratio, and, a, driving, frequency, near, the, resonant, frequency, the, steady, state, oscillations, can, become, very, large, for, other, driven, damped, harmonic, oscillators, whose, equations, of, motion, do, not, look, exactly, like, the, mass, on, a, spring, example, the, resonant, frequency, remains, r, 0, 1, 2, 2, displaystyle, omega, r, omega, 0, sqrt, 1, 2, zeta, 2, but, the, definitions, of, 0, and, change, based, on, the, physics, of, the, system, for, a, pendulum, of, length, and, small, displacement, angle, equation, 1, becomes, m, d, 2, d, t, 2, f, 0, sin, t, m, g, c, d, d, t,

resistor, with, resistance, r, an, inductor, with, inductance, l, and, a, capacitor, with, capacitance, c, connected, in, series, with, current, i, t, and, driven, by, a, voltage, source, with, voltage, v, in, t, the, voltage, drop, around, the, circuit, is, rather, than, analyzing, a, candidate, solution, to, this, equation, like, in, the, mass, on, a, spring, example, above, this, section, will, analyze, the, frequency, response, of, this, circuit, taking, the, laplace, transform, of, equation, 4, s, l, i, s, r, i, s, 1, s, c, i, s, v, in, s, displaystyle, sli, s, ri, s, frac, 1, sc, i,

poles, roots, of, the, polynomial, in, the, transfer, function, s, denominator, at, and, no, zeros, roots, of, the, polynomial, in, the, transfer, function, s, numerator, moreover, for, 1, the, magnitude, of, these, poles, is, the, natural, frequency, 0, and, that, for, 1, 2, displaystyle, sqrt, 2, our, condition, for, resonance, in, the, harmonic, oscillator, example, the, poles, are, closer, to, the, imaginary, axis, than, to, the, real, axis, evaluating, h, s, along, the, imaginary, axis, s, i, the, transfer, function, describes, the, frequency, response, of, this, circuit, equivalently, the, frequency, response, can, be, analyzed, by, taking, the, fourier, transform, of, equation, 4, instead, of, the, laplace, transform, the, transfer, function, which, is, also, complex, can, be, written, as, a, gain, and, phase, h, i, g, e, i, displaystyle, h, i, omega, g, omega, e, i, phi, omega, a, sinusoidal, input, voltage, at, frequency, results, in, an, output, voltage, at, the, same, frequency, that, has, been, scaled, by, g, and, has, a, phase, shift, the, gain, and, phase, can, be, plotted, versus, frequency, on, a, bode, plot, for, the, rlc, circuit, s, capacitor, voltage, the, gain, of, the, transfer, function, h, i, is, note, the, similarity, between, the, gain, here, and, the, amplitude, in, equation, 3, once, again, the, gain, is, maximized, at, the, resonant, frequency, r, 0, 1, 2, 2, displaystyle, omega, r, omega, 0, sqrt, 1, 2, zeta, 2, here, the, resonance, corresponds, physically, to, having, a, relatively, large, amplitude, for, the, steady, state, oscillations, of, the, voltage, across, the, capacitor, compared, to, its, amplitude, at, other, driving, frequencies, the, resonant, frequency, need, not, always, take, the, form, given, in, the, examples, above, for, the, rlc, circuit, suppose, instead, that, the, output, voltage, of, interest, is, the, voltage, across, the, inductor, as, shown, above, in, the, laplace, domain, the, voltage, across, the, inductor, is, v, out, s, s, l, i, s, displaystyle, v, text, out, s, sli, s, v, out, s, s, 2, s, 2, r, l, s, 1, l, c, v, in, s, displaystyle, v, text, out, s, frac,

s, using, the, same, definitions, for, 0, and, as, in, the, previous, example, the, transfer, function, between, v, in, s, and, this, new, v, out, s, across, the, inductor, is, h, s, s, 2, s, 2, 2, 0, s, 0, 2, displaystyle, h, s, frac, s, 2, s, 2, 2, zeta, omega, 0, s, omega, 0, 2, this, transfer, function, has, the, same, poles, as, the, transfer, function, in, the, previous, example, but, it, also, has, two, zeroes, in, the, numerator, at, s, 0, evaluating, h, s, along, the, imaginary, axis, its, gain, becomes, g, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, displaystyle, g, omega, frac, omega, 2, sqrt, left, 2, omega, omega, 0, zeta, right, 2, omega, 0, 2, omega, 2, 2, compared, to, the, gain, in, equation, 6, using, the, capacitor, voltage, as, the, output, this, gain, has, a, factor, of, 2, in, the, numerator, and, will, therefore, have, a, different, resonant, frequency, that, maximizes, the, gain, that, frequency, is, r, 0, 1, 2, 2, displaystyle, omega, r, frac, omega, 0, sqrt, 1, 2, zeta, 2, so, for, the, same, rlc, circuit, but, with, the, voltage, across, the, inductor, as, the, output, the, resonant, frequency, is, now, larger, than, the, natural, frequency, though, it, still, tends, towards, the, natural, frequency, as, the, damping, ratio, goes, to, zero, that, the, same, circuit, can, have, different, resonant, frequencies, for, different, choices, of, output, is, not, contradictory, as, shown, in, equation, 4, the, voltage, drop, across, the, circuit, is, divided, among, the, three, circuit, elements, and, each, element, has, different, dynamics, the, capacitor, s, voltage, grows, slowly, by, integrating, the, current, over, time, and, is, therefore, more, sensitive, to, lower, frequencies, whereas, the, inductor, s, voltage, grows, when, the, current, changes, rapidly, and, is, therefore, more, sensitive, to, higher, frequencies, while, the, circuit, as, a, whole, has, a, natural, frequency, where, it, tends, to, oscillate, the, different, dynamics, of, each, circuit, element, make, each, element, resonate, at, a, slightly, different, frequency, suppose, that, the, output, voltage, of, interest, is, the, voltage, across, the, resistor, in, the, laplace, domain, the, voltage, across, the, resistor, is, v, out, s, r, i, s, displaystyle, v, text, out, s, ri, s, v, out, s, r, s, l, s, 2, r, l, s, 1, l, c, v, in, s, displaystyle, v, text, out, s, frac, rs, l, left, s, 2, frac, r, l, s, frac, 1, lc, right, v, text, in, s, and, using, the, same, natural, frequency, and, damping, ratio, as, in, the, capacitor, example, the, transfer, function, is, h, s, 2, 0, s, s, 2, 2, 0, s, 0, 2, displaystyle, h, s, frac, 2, zeta, omega, 0, s, s, 2, 2, zeta, omega, 0, s, omega, 0, 2, this, transfer, function, also, has, the, same, poles, as, the, previous, rlc, circuit, examples, but, it, only, has, one, zero, in, the, numerator, at, s, 0, for, this, transfer, function, its, gain, is, g, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, displaystyle, g, omega, frac, 2, zeta, omega, 0, omega, sqrt, left, 2, omega, omega, 0, zeta, right, 2, omega, 0, 2, omega, 2, 2, the, resonant, frequency, that, maximizes, this, gain, is, r, 0, displaystyle, omega, r, omega, 0, and, the, gain, is, one, at, this, frequency, so, the, voltage, across, the, resistor, resonates, at, the, circuit, s, natural, frequency, and, at, this, frequency, the, amplitude, of, the, voltage, across, the, resistor, equals, the, input, voltage, s, amplitude, some, systems, exhibit, antiresonance, that, can, be, analyzed, in, the, same, way, as, resonance, for, antiresonance, the, amplitude, of, the, response, of, the, system, at, certain, frequencies, is, disproportionately, small, rather, than, being, disproportionately, large, in, the, rlc, circuit, example, this, phenomenon, can, be, observed, by, analyzing, both, the, inductor, and, the, capacitor, combined, suppose, that, the, output, voltage, of, interest, in, the, rlc, circuit, is, the, voltage, across, the, inductor, and, the, capacitor, combined, in, series, equation, 4, showed, that, the, sum, of, the, voltages, across, the, three, circuit, elements, sums, to, the, input, voltage, so, measuring, the, output, voltage, as, the, sum, of, the, inductor, and, capacitor, voltages, combined, is, the, same, as, v, in, minus, the, voltage, drop, across, the, resistor, the, previous, example, showed, that, at, the, natural, frequency, of, the, system, the, amplitude, of, the, voltage, drop, across, the, resistor, equals, the, amplitude, of, v, in, and, therefore, the, voltage, across, the, inductor, and, capacitor, combined, has, zero, amplitude, we, can, show, this, with, the, transfer, function, the, sum, of, the, inductor, and, capacitor, voltages, is, v, out, s, s, l, 1, s, c, i, s, displaystyle, v, text,

using, the, same, natural, frequency, and, damping, ratios, as, the, previous, examples, the, transfer, function, is, h, s, s, 2, 0, 2, s, 2, 2, 0, s, 0, 2, displaystyle, h, s, frac, s, 2, omega, 0, 2, s, 2, 2, zeta, omega, 0, s, omega, 0, 2, this, transfer, has, the, same, poles, as, the, previous, examples, but, has, zeroes, at, evaluating, the, transfer, function, along, the, imaginary, axis, its, gain, is, g, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, displaystyle, g, omega, frac, omega, 0, 2, omega, 2, sqrt, left, 2, omega, omega, 0, zeta, right, 2, omega, 0, 2, omega, 2, 2, rather, than, look, for, resonance, i, e, peaks, of, the, gain, notice, that, the, gain, goes, to, zero, at, 0, which, complements, our, analysis, of, the, resistor, s, voltage, this, is, called, antiresonance, which, has, the, opposite, effect, of, resonance, rather, than, result, in, outputs, that, are, disproportionately, large, at, this, frequency, this, circuit, with, this, choice, of, output, has, no, response, at, all, at, this, frequency, the, frequency, that, is, filtered, out, corresponds, exactly, to, the, zeroes, of, the, transfer, function, which, were, shown, in, equation, 7, and, were, on, the, imaginary, axis, these, rlc, circuit, examples, illustrate, how, resonance, is, related, to, the, frequency, response, of, the, system, specifically, these, examples, illustrate, the, next, section, extends, these, concepts, to, resonance, in, a, general, linear, system, next, consider, an, arbitrary, linear, system, with, multiple, inputs, and, outputs, for, example, in, state, space,

written, as, a, fraction, whose, numerator, and, denominator, are, polynomials, of, s, h, i, j, s, n, i, j, s, d, i, j, s, displaystyle, h, ij, s, frac, n, ij, s, d, ij, s, the, complex, roots, of, the, numerator, are, called, zeroes, and, the, complex, roots, of, the, denominator, are, called, poles, for, a, stable, system, the, positions, of, these, poles, and, zeroes, on, the, complex, plane, give, some, indication, of, whether, the, system, can, resonate, or, antiresonate, and, at, which, frequencies, in, particular, any, stable, or, marginally, stable, complex, conjugate, pair, of,

particular, frequency, a, wave, propagates, along, the, string, at, the, same, frequency, the, waves, reflect, off, the, ends, of, the, string, and, eventually, a, steady, state, is, reached, with, waves, traveling, in, both, directions, the, waveform, is, the, superposition, of, the, waves, at, certain, frequencies, the, steady, state, waveform, does, not, appear, to, travel, along, the, string, at, fixed, positions, called, nodes, the, string, is, never, displaced, between, the, nodes, the, string, oscillates, and, exactly, halfway, between, the, nodes, at, positions, called, anti,

the, frequency, of, its, oscillations, matches, the, system, s, natural, frequency, of, vibration, than, it, does, at, other, frequencies, it, may, cause, violent, swaying, motions, and, even, catastrophic, failure, in, improperly, constructed, structures, including, bridges, buildings, trains, and, aircraft, when, designing, objects, engineers, must, ensure, the, mechanical, resonance, frequencies, of, the, component, parts, do, not, match, driving, vibrational, frequencies, of, motors, or, other, oscillating, parts, a, phenomenon, known, as, resonance, disaster, avoiding, resonance, disasters, is, a, major, concern, in, every, building, tower, and, bridge, construction, project, as, a, countermeasure, shock, mounts, can, be, installed, to, absorb, resonant, frequencies, and, thus, dissipate, the, absorbed, energy, the, taipei, 101, building, relies, on, a, 660, tonne, pendulum, 730, short, ton, a, tuned, mass, damper, to, cancel, resonance, furthermore, the, structure, is, designed, to, resonate, at, a, frequency, that, does, not, typically, occur, buildings, in, seismic, zones, are, often, constructed, to, take, into, account, the, oscillating, frequencies, of, expected, ground, motion, in, addition, engineers, designing, objects, having, engines, must, ensure, that, the, mechanical, resonant, frequencies, of, the, component, parts, do, not, match, driving, vibrational, frequencies, of, the, motors, or, other, strongly, oscillating, parts, clocks, keep, time, by, mechanical, resonance, in, a, balance, wheel, pendulum, or, quartz, crystal, the, cadence, of, runners, has, been, hypothesized, to, be, energetically, favorable, due, to, resonance, between, the, elastic, energy, stored, in, the, lower, limb, and, the, mass, of, the, runner, acoustic, resonance, is, a, branch, of, mechanical, resonance, that, is, concerned, with, the, mechanical, vibrations, across, the, frequency, range, of, human, hearing, in, other, words, sound, for, humans, hearing, is, normally, limited, to, frequencies, between, about, 20, hz, and, 20, 000, hz, 20, khz, many, objects, and, materials, act, as, resonators, with, resonant, frequencies, within, this, range, and, when, struck, vibrate, mechanically, pushing, on, the, surrounding, air, to, create, sound, waves, this, is, the, source, of, many, percussive, sounds, we, hear, acoustic, resonance, is, an, important, consideration, for, instrument, builders, as, most, acoustic, instruments, use, resonators, such, as, the, strings, and, body, of, a, violin, the, length, of, tube, in, a, flute, and, the, shape, of, and, tension, on, a, drum, membrane, like, mechanical, resonance, acoustic, resonance, can, result, in, catastrophic, failure, of, the, object, at, resonance, the, classic, example, of, this, is, breaking, a, wine, glass, with, sound, at, the, precise, resonant, frequency, of, the, glass, although, this, is, difficult, in, practice, the, rocket, engines, for, the, international, space, station, iss, are, controlled, by, an, autopilot, ordinarily, uploaded, parameters, for, controlling, the, engine, control, system, for, the, zvezda, module, make, the, rocket, engines, boost, the, international, space, station, to, a, higher, orbit, the, rocket, engines, are, hinge, mounted, and, ordinarily, the, crew, does, not, notice, the, operation, on, january, 14, 2009, however, the, uploaded, parameters, made, the, autopilot, swing, the, rocket, engines, in, larger, and, larger, oscillations, at, a, frequency, of, 0, 5, hz, these, oscillations, were, captured, on, video, and, lasted, for, 142, seconds, electrical, resonance, occurs, in, an, electric, circuit, at, a, particular, resonant, frequency, when, the, impedance, of, the, circuit, is, at, a, minimum, in, a, series, circuit, or, at, maximum, in, a, parallel, circuit, usually, when, the, transfer, function, peaks, in, absolute, value, resonance, in, circuits, are, used, for, both, transmitting, and, receiving, wireless, communications, such, as, television, cell, phones, and, radio, an, optical, cavity, also, called, an, optical, resonator, is, an, arrangement, of, mirrors, that, forms, a, standing, wave, cavity, resonator, for, light, waves, optical, cavities, are, a, major, component, of, lasers, surrounding, the, gain, medium, and, providing, feedback, of, the, laser, light, they, are, also, used, in, optical, parametric, oscillators, and, some, interferometers, light, confined, in, the, cavity, reflects, multiple, times, producing, standing, waves, for, certain, resonant, frequencies, the, standing, wave, patterns, produced, are, called, modes, longitudinal, modes, differ, only, in, frequency, while, transverse, modes, differ, for, different, frequencies, and, have, different, intensity, patterns, across, the, cross, section, of, the, beam, ring, resonators, and, whispering, galleries, are, examples, of, optical, resonators, that, do, not, form, standing, waves, different, resonator, types, are, distinguished, by, the, focal, lengths, of, the, two, mirrors, and, the, distance, between, them, flat, mirrors, are, not, often, used, because, of, the, difficulty, of, aligning, them, precisely, the, geometry, resonator, type, must, be, chosen, so, the, beam, remains, stable, i, e, the, beam, size, does, not, continue, to, grow, with, each, reflection, resonator, types, are, also, designed, to, meet, other, criteria, such, as, minimum, beam, waist, or, having, no, focal, point, and, therefore, intense, light, at, that, point, inside, the, cavity, optical, cavities, are, designed, to, have, a, very, large, q, factor, a, beam, reflects, a, large, number, of, times, with, little, attenuation, therefore, the, frequency, line, width, of, the, beam, is, small, compared, to, the, frequency, of, the, laser, additional, optical, resonances, are, guided, mode, resonances, and, surface, plasmon, resonance, which, result, in, anomalous, reflection, and, high, evanescent, fields, at, resonance, in, this, case, the, resonant, modes, are, guided, modes, of, a, waveguide, or, surface, plasmon, modes, of, a, dielectric, metallic, interface, these, modes, are, usually, excited, by, a, subwavelength, grating, in, celestial, mechanics, an, orbital, resonance, occurs, when, two, orbiting, bodies, exert, a, regular, periodic, gravitational, influence, on, each, other, usually, due, to, their, orbital, periods, being, related, by, a, ratio, of, two, small, integers, orbital, resonances, greatly, enhance, the, mutual, gravitational, influence, of, the, bodies, in, most, cases, this, results, in, an, unstable, interaction, in, which, the, bodies, exchange, momentum, and, shift, orbits, until, the, resonance, no, longer, exists, under, some, circumstances, a, resonant, system, can, be, stable, and, self, correcting, so, that, the, bodies, remain, in, resonance, examples, are, the, 1, 2, 4, resonance, of, jupiter, s, moons, ganymede, europa, and, io, and, the, 2, 3, resonance, between, pluto, and, neptune, unstable, resonances, with, saturn, s, inner, moons, give, rise, to, gaps, in, the, rings, of, saturn, the, special, case, of, 1, 1, resonance, between, bodies, with, similar, orbital, radii, causes, large, solar, system, bodies, to, clear, the, neighborhood, around, their, orbits, by, ejecting, nearly, everything, else, around, them, this, effect, is, used, in, the, current, definition, of, a, planet, nuclear, magnetic, resonance, nmr, is, the, name, given, to, a, physical, resonance, phenomenon, involving, the, observation, of, specific, quantum, mechanical, magnetic, properties, of, an, atomic, nucleus, in, the, presence, of, an, applied, external, magnetic, field, many, scientific, techniques, exploit, nmr, phenomena, to, study, molecular, physics, crystals, and, non, crystalline, materials, through, nmr, spectroscopy, nmr, is, also, routinely, used, in, advanced, medical, imaging, techniques, such, as, in, magnetic, resonance, imaging, mri, all, nuclei, containing, odd, numbers, of, nucleons, have, an, intrinsic, magnetic, moment, and, angular, momentum, a, key, feature, of, nmr, is, that, the, resonant, frequency, of, a, particular, substance, is, directly, proportional, to, the, strength, of, the, applied, magnetic, field, it, is, this, feature, that, is, exploited, in, imaging, techniques, if, a, sample, is, placed, in, a, non, uniform, magnetic, field, then, the, resonant, frequencies, of, the, sample, s, nuclei, depend, on, where, in, the, field, they, are, located, therefore, the, particle, can, be, located, quite, precisely, by, its, resonant, frequency, electron, paramagnetic, resonance, otherwise, known, as, electron, spin, resonance, esr, is, a, spectroscopic, technique, similar, to, nmr, but, uses, unpaired, electrons, instead, materials, for, which, this, can, be, applied, are, much, more, limited, since, the, material, needs, to, both, have, an, unpaired, spin, and, be, paramagnetic, the, m, ssbauer, effect, is, the, resonant, and, recoil, free, emission, and, absorption, of, gamma, ray, photons, by, atoms, bound, in, a, solid, form, resonance, in, particle, physics, appears, in, similar, circumstances, to, classical, physics, at, the, level, of, quantum, mechanics, and, quantum, field, theory, resonances, can, also, be, thought, of, as, unstable, particles, with, the, formula, in, the, universal, resonance, curve, section, of, this, article, applying, if, is, the, particle, s, decay, rate, and, is, the, particle, s, mass, m, in, that, case, the, formula, comes, from, the, particle, s, propagator, with, its, mass, replaced, by, the, complex, number, m, i, the, formula, is, further, related, to, the, particle, s, decay, rate, by, the, optical, theorem, a, column, of, soldiers, marching, in, regular, step, on, a, narrow, and, structurally, flexible, bridge, can, set, it, into, dangerously, large, amplitude, oscillations, on, april, 12, 1831, the, broughton, suspension, bridge, near, salford, england, collapsed, while, a, group, of, british, soldiers, were, marching, across, since, then, the, british, army, has, had, a, standing, order, for, soldiers, to, break, stride, when, marching, across, bridges, to, avoid, resonance, from, their, regular, marching, pattern, affecting, the, bridge, vibrations, of, a, motor, or, engine, can, induce, resonant, vibration, in, its, supporting, structures, if, their, natural, frequency, is, close, to, that, of, the, vibrations, of, the, engine, a, common, example, is, the, rattling, sound, of, a, bus, body, when, the, engine, is, left, idling, structural, resonance, of, a, suspension, bridge, induced, by, winds, can, lead, to, its, catastrophic, collapse, several, early, suspension, bridges, in, europe, and, united, states, were, destroyed, by, structural, resonance, induced, by, modest, winds, the, collapse, of, the, tacoma, narrows, bridge, on, 7, november, 1940, is, characterized, in, physics, as, a, classic, example, of, resonance, it, has, been, argued, by, robert, h, scanlan, and, others, that, the, destruction, was, instead, caused, by, aeroelastic, flutter, a, complicated, interaction, between, the, bridge, and, the, winds, passing, through, it, an, example, of, a, self, oscillation, or, a, kind, of, self, sustaining, vibration, as, referred, to, in, the, nonlinear, theory, of, vibrations, the, q, factor, or, quality, factor, is, a, dimensionless, parameter, that, describes, how, under, damped, an, oscillator, or, resonator, is, and, characterizes, the, bandwidth, of, a, resonator, relative, to, its, center, frequency, a, high, value, for, q, indicates, a, lower, rate, of, energy, loss, relative, to, the, stored, energy, i, e, the, system, is, lightly, damped, the, parameter, is, defined, by, the, equation, q, 2, maximum, energy, stored, total, energy, lost, per, cycle, at,

resonant, frequency, and, the, smaller, the, bandwidth, or, range, of, frequencies, around, resonance, occurs, in, electrical, resonance, a, high, q, circuit, in, a, radio, receiver, is, more, difficult, to, tune, but, has, greater, selectivity, and, so, would, be, better, at, filtering, out, signals, from, other, stations, high, q, oscillators, are, more, stable, examples, that, normally, have, a, low, q, factor, include, door, closers, q, 0, 5, systems, with, high, q, factors, include, tuning, forks, q, 1000, atomic, clocks, and, lasers, q, 10, 11, the, exact, response, of, a, resonance, especially, for, frequencies, far, from, the, resonant, frequency, depends, on, the, details, of, the, physical, system, and, is, usually, not, exactly, symmetric, about, the, resonant, frequency, as, illustrated, for, the, simple, harmonic, oscillator, above, for, a, lightly, damped, linear, oscillator, with, a, resonance, frequency, 0, displaystyle, omega, 0, the, intensity, of, oscillations, i, displaystyle, i, when, the, system, is, driven, with, a, driving, frequency, displaystyle, omega, is, typically, approximated, by, the, following, formula, that, is, symmetric, about, the, resonance, frequency, i, 2, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, displaystyle, i, omega, equiv, chi, 2, propto, frac, 1, omega, omega, 0, 2, left, frac, gamma, 2, right, 2, where, the, susceptibility, displaystyle,

of, the, amplitude, of, the, oscillations, this, is, a, lorentzian, function, or, cauchy, distribution, and, this, response, is, found, in, many, physical, situations, involving, resonant, systems, is, a, parameter, dependent, on, the, damping, of, the, oscillator, and, is, known, as, the, linewidth, of, the, resonance, heavily, damped, oscillators, tend, to, have, broad, linewidths, and, respond, to, a, wider, range, of, driving, frequencies, around, the, resonant, frequency, the, linewidth, is, inversely, proportional, to, the, q, factor, which, is, a, measure, of, the, sharpness, of, the, resonance, in, radio, engineering, and, electronics, engineering, this, approximate, symmetric, response, is, known, as, the, universal, resonance, curve, a, concept, introduced, by, frederick, e, terman, in, 1932, to, simplify, the, approximate, analysis, of, radio, circuits, with, a, range, of, center, frequencies, and, q, values
