the, carina, nebula, or, eta, carinae, nebula, catalogued, as, ngc, 3372, also, known, as, the, great, carina, nebula, is, a, large, complex, area, of, bright, and, dark, nebulosity, in, the, constellation, carina, located, in, the, carina, sagittarius, arm, of, the, milky, way, galaxy, the, nebula, is, approximately, 8, 500, light, years, 2, 600, pc, from, earth, the, nebula, has, within, its, boundaries, the, large, carina, ob1, association, and, several, related, open, clusters, including, numerous, o, type, stars, and, several, wolf, rayet, stars, carina, ob1, encompasses, the, star, clusters, trumpler, 14, and, trumpler, 16, trumpler, 14, is, one, of, the, youngest, known, star, clusters, at, half, a, million, years, old, and, contains, stars, like, the, o2, supergiant, hd, 93129a, trumpler, 16, is, the, home, of, many, extremely, luminous, stars, such, as, wr, 25, and, the, eta, carinae, star, system, trumpler, 15, collinder, 228, collinder, 232, ngc, 3324, and, ngc, 3293, are, also, considered, members, of, the, association, ngc, 3293, is, the, oldest, and, furthest, from, trumpler, 14, indicating, sequential, and, ongoing, star, formation, the, nebula, is, one, of, the, largest, diffuse, nebulae, in, our, skies, although, it, is, four, times, as, large, as, and, even, brighter, than, the, famous, orion, nebula, the, carina, nebula, is, much, less, well, known, due, to, its, location, in, the, southern, sky, it, was, discovered, by, nicolas, louis, de, lacaille, in, 1752, from, the, cape, of, good, hope, the, carina, nebula, was, selected, as, one, of, five, cosmic, objects, observed, by, the, james, webb, space, telescope, as, part, of, the, release, of, its, first, official, science, images, a, detailed, image, was, made, of, an, early, star, forming, region, of, ngc, 3324, known, as, the, cosmic, cliffs, nicolas, louis, de, lacaille, discovered, the, nebula, on, 25, january, 1752, its, dimensions, are, 120, 120, arcminutes, centered, on, the, coordinates, of, right, ascension, 10, h, 45, m, 08, 5, s, and, declination, 59, 52, 04, in, modern, times, it, is, calculated, to, be, around, 8, 500, light, years, 2, 600, pc, from, earth, eta, carinae, is, a, highly, luminous, hypergiant, star, estimates, of, its, mass, range, from, 100, to, 150, times, the, mass, of, the, sun, and, its, luminosity, is, about, four, million, times, that, of, the, sun, this, object, is, currently, the, most, massive, star, that, can, be, studied, in, great, detail, because, of, its, location, and, size, several, other, known, stars, may, be, more, luminous, and, more, massive, but, data, on, them, is, far, less, robust, caveat, since, examples, such, as, the, pistol, star, have, been, demoted, by, improved, data, one, should, be, skeptical, of, most, available, lists, of, most, massive, stars, in, 2006, eta, carinae, still, had, the, highest, confirmed, luminosity, based, on, data, across, a, broad, range, of, wavelengths, stars, with, more, than, 80, times, the, mass, of, the, sun, produce, more, than, a, million, times, as, much, light, as, the, sun, they, are, quite, rare, only, a, few, dozen, in, a, galaxy, as, big, as, ours, and, they, flirt, with, disaster, near, the, eddington, limit, i, e, the, outward, pressure, of, their, radiation, is, almost, strong, enough, to, counteract, gravity, stars, that, are, more, than, 120, solar, masses, exceed, the, theoretical, eddington, limit, and, their, gravity, is, barely, strong, enough, to, hold, in, its, radiation, and, gas, resulting, in, a, possible, supernova, or, hypernova, in, the, near, future, eta, carinae, s, effects, on, the, nebula, can, be, seen, directly, dark, globules, and, some, other, less, visible, objects, have, tails, pointing, directly, away, from, the, massive, star, the, entire, nebula, would, have, looked, very, different, before, the, great, eruption, in, the, 1840s, surrounded, eta, carinae, with, dust, drastically, reducing, the, amount, of, ultraviolet, light, it, put, into, the, nebula, within, the, large, bright, nebula, is, a, much, smaller, feature, immediately, surrounding, eta, carinae, itself, known, as, the, homunculus, nebula, from, latin, meaning, little, man, it, is, believed, to, have, been, ejected, in, an, enormous, outburst, in, 1841, which, briefly, made, eta, carinae, the, second, brightest, star, in, the, sky, the, homunculus, nebula, is, a, small, h, ii, region, with, gas, shocked, into, ionized, and, excited, states, it, also, absorbs, much, of, the, light, from, the, extremely, luminous, central, stellar, system, and, re, radiates, it, as, infrared, ir, it, is, the, brightest, object, in, the, sky, at, mid, ir, wavelengths, 145, 169, the, distance, to, the, homunculus, can, be, derived, from, its, observed, angular, dimensions, and, calculated, linear, size, assuming, it, is, axially, symmetric, the, most, accurate, distance, obtained, using, this, method, is, 7, 660, 160, light, years, 2, 350, 50, pc, the, largest, radius, of, the, bipolar, lobes, in, this, model, is, about, 22, 000, au, and, the, axis, is, oriented, 41, from, the, line, of, sight, or, 49, relative, to, the, plane, of, the, sky, which, means, it, is, seen, from, earth, slightly, more, end, on, than, side, on, the, keyhole, or, keyhole, nebula, is, a, small, dark, cloud, of, cold, molecules, and, dust, within, the, carina, nebula, containing, bright, filaments, of, hot, fluorescing, gas, silhouetted, against, the, much, brighter, background, nebula, john, herschel, used, the, term, lemniscate, oval, vacuity, when, first, describing, it, and, subsequently, referred, to, it, simply, as, the, oval, vacuity, the, term, lemniscate, continued, to, be, used, to, describe, this, portion, of, the, nebula, until, popular, astronomy, writer, emma, converse, described, the, shape, of, the, nebula, as, resembling, a, keyhole, in, an, 1873, appleton, s, journal, article, the, name, keyhole, nebula, then, came, into, common, use, sometimes, for, the, keyhole, itself, sometimes, to, describe, the, whole, of, the, carina, nebula, signifying, the, nebula, that, contains, the, keyhole, the, diameter, of, the, keyhole, structure, is, approximately, seven, light, years, 2, 1, pc, its, appearance, has, changed, significantly, since, it, was, first, observed, possibly, due, to, changes, in, the, ionizing, radiation, from, eta, carinae, the, keyhole, does, not, have, its, own, ngc, designation, it, is, sometimes, erroneously, called, ngc, 3324, but, that, catalogue, designation, refers, to, a, reflection, and, emission, nebula, just, northwest, of, the, carina, nebula, or, to, its, embedded, star, cluster, a, small, bok, globule, in, the, keyhole, nebula, at, ra, 10h, 44m, 30s, dec, 59, 40, has, been, photographed, by, the, hubble, space, telescope, and, is, nicknamed, the, carina, defiant, finger, due, to, its, shape, in, hubble, images, light, can, be, seen, radiating, off, the, edges, of, the, globule, this, is, especially, visible, in, the, southern, tip, where, the, finger, is, it, is, thought, that, the, defiant, finger, is, being, ionized, by, the, bright, wolf, rayet, star, wr, 25, and, or, trumpler, 16, 244, a, bright, blue, supergiant, it, has, a, mass, of, at, least, 6, m, and, stars, may, be, forming, within, it, like, other, interstellar, clouds, under, intense, radiation, the, defiant, finger, will, eventually, be, completely, evaporated, for, this, cloud, the, time, frame, is, predicted, to, be, 200, 000, to, 1, 000, 000, years, trumpler, 14, is, an, open, cluster, with, a, diameter, of, six, light, years, 1, 8, pc, located, within, the, inner, regions, of, the, carina, nebula, approximately, 8, 000, light, years, 2, 500, pc, from, earth, it, is, one, of, the, main, clusters, of, the, carina, ob1, stellar, association, which, is, the, largest, association, in, the, carina, nebula, about, 2, 000, stars, have, been, identified, in, trumpler, 14, and, the, total, mass, of, the, cluster, is, estimated, to, be, 4, 300, m, trumpler, 15, is, a, star, cluster, on, the, north, east, edge, of, the, carina, nebula, early, studies, disagreed, about, the, distance, but, astrometric, measurements, by, the, gaia, mission, have, confirmed, that, it, is, the, same, distance, as, the, rest, of, carina, ob1, trumpler, 16, is, one, of, the, main, clusters, of, the, carina, ob1, stellar, association, which, is, the, largest, association, in, the, carina, nebula, and, it, is, bigger, and, more, massive, than, trumpler, 14, the, star, eta, carinae, is, part, of, this, cluster, mystic, mountain, is, the, term, for, a, dust, gas, pillar, in, the, carina, nebula, a, photo, of, which, was, taken, by, hubble, space, telescope, on, its, 20th, anniversary, the, area, was, observed, by, hubble, s, wide, field, camera, 3, on, 1, 2, february, 2010, the, pillar, measures, three, light, years, 0, 92, pc, in, height, nascent, stars, inside, the, pillar, fire, off, gas, jets, that, stream, from, towering, peaks, wr, 22, is, an, eclipsing, binary, the, dynamical, masses, derived, from, orbital, fitting, vary, from, over, 70, m, to, less, than, 60, m, for, the, primary, and, about, 21, to, 27, m, for, the, secondary, the, spectroscopic, mass, of, the, primary, has, been, calculated, at, 74, m, or, 78, 1, m, wr, 25, is, a, binary, system, in, the, central, portion, of, the, carina, nebula, a, member, of, the, trumpler, 16, cluster, the, primary, is, a, wolf, rayet, star, possibly, the, most, luminous, star, in, the, galaxy, the, secondary, is, hard, to, detect, but, thought, to, be, a, luminous, ob, star, hd, 93129, is, a, triple, star, system, of, o, class, stars, in, carina, all, three, stars, of, hd, 93129, are, among, the, most, luminous, in, the, galaxy, hd, 93129, consists, of, two, clearly, resolved, components, hd, 93129, a, and, hd, 93129, b, and, hd, 93129, a, itself, is, made, up, of, two, much, closer, stars, hd, 93129, a, has, been, resolved, into, two, components, the, spectrum, is, dominated, by, the, brighter, component, although, the, secondary, is, only, 0, 9, magnitudes, fainter, hd, 93129, aa, is, an, o2, supergiant, and, ab, is, an, o3, 5, main, sequence, star, their, separation, has, decreased, from, 55, milliarcseconds, in, 2004, to, only, 27, mas, in, 2013, but, an, accurate, orbit, is, not, available, hd, 93129, b, is, an, o3, 5, main, sequence, star, 3, arcseconds, away, from, the, closer, pair, it, is, about, 1, 5, magnitudes, fainter, than, the, combined, hd, 93129, a, and, is, approximately, the, same, brightness, as, hd, 93129, ab, hd, 93250, is, one, of, the, brightest, stars, in, the, region, of, the, carina, nebula, it, is, only, 7, 5, arcminutes, from, eta, carinae, and, hd, 93250, is, considered, to, be, a, member, of, the, same, loose, open, cluster, trumpler, 16, although, it, appears, closer, to, the, more, compact, trumpler, 14, hd, 93250, is, known, to, be, a, binary, star, however, individual, spectra, of, the, two, components, have, never, been, observed, but, are, thought, to, be, very, similar, the, spectral, type, of, hd, 93250, has, variously, been, given, as, o5, o6, 7, o4, and, o3, it, has, sometimes, been, classified, as, a, main, sequence, star, and, sometimes, as, a, giant, star, the, galactic, o, star, spectroscopic, survey, has, used, it, as, the, standard, star, for, the, newly, created, o4, subgiant, spectral, type, hd, 93205, is, a, binary, system, of, two, large, stars, the, more, massive, member, of, the, pair, is, an, o3, 5, main, sequence, star, the, spectrum, shows, some, ionized, nitrogen, and, helium, emission, lines, indicating, some, mixing, of, fusion, products, to, the, surface, and, a, strong, stellar, wind, the, mass, calculated, from, apsidal, motion, of, the, orbits, is, 40, to, 60, m, this, is, somewhat, lower, than, expected, from, evolutionary, modelling, of, a, star, with, its, observed, parameters, the, less, massive, member, is, an, o8, main, sequence, star, of, approximately, 20, m, it, moves, in, its, orbit, at, a, speed, of, over, 300, km, s, 190, mi, s, and, is, considered, to, be, a, relativistic, binary, which, causes, the, apses, of, the, orbit, to, change, in, a, predictable, way, as, of, 1998, there, are, eight, known, open, clusters, in, the, carina, nebula
