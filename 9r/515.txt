in, organic, chemistry, a, hydrocarbon, is, an, organic, compound, consisting, entirely, of, hydrogen, and, carbon, 620, hydrocarbons, are, examples, of, group, 14, hydrides, hydrocarbons, are, generally, colourless, and, hydrophobic, their, odor, is, usually, faint, and, may, be, similar, to, that, of, gasoline, or, lighter, fluid, they, occur, in, a, diverse, range, of, molecular, structures, and, phases, they, can, be, gases, such, as, methane, and, propane, liquids, such, as, hexane, and, benzene, low, melting, solids, such, as, paraffin, wax, and, naphthalene, or, polymers, such, as, polyethylene, and, polystyrene, in, the, fossil, fuel, industries, hydrocarbon, refers, to, naturally, occurring, petroleum, natural, gas, and, coal, or, their, hydrocarbon, derivatives, and, purified, forms, combustion, of, hydrocarbons, is, the, main, source, of, the, world, s, energy, petroleum, is, the, dominant, raw, material, source, for, organic, commodity, chemicals, such, as, solvents, and, polymers, most, anthropogenic, human, generated, emissions, of, greenhouse, gases, are, either, carbon, dioxide, released, by, the, burning, of, fossil, fuels, or, methane, released, from, the, handling, of, natural, gas, or, from, agriculture, as, defined, by, the, international, union, of, pure, and, applied, chemistry, s, nomenclature, of, organic, chemistry, hydrocarbons, are, classified, as, follows, the, term, aliphatic, refers, to, non, aromatic, hydrocarbons, saturated, aliphatic, hydrocarbons, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, paraffins, aliphatic, hydrocarbons, containing, a, double, bond, between, carbon, atoms, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, olefins, the, predominant, use, of, hydrocarbons, is, as, a, combustible, fuel, source, methane, is, the, predominant, component, of, natural, gas, c, 6, through, c, 10, alkanes, alkenes, cycloalkanes, and, aromatic, hydrocarbons, are, the, main, components, of, gasoline, naphtha, jet, fuel, and, specialized, industrial, solvent, mixtures, with, the, progressive, addition, of, carbon, units, the, simple, non, ring, structured, hydrocarbons, have, higher, viscosities, lubricating, indices, boiling, points, solidification, temperatures, and, deeper, color, at, the, opposite, extreme, from, methane, lie, the, heavy, tars, that, remain, as, the, lowest, fraction, in, a, crude, oil, refining, retort, they, are, collected, and, widely, utilized, as, roofing, compounds, pavement, material, bitumen, wood, preservatives, the, creosote, series, and, as, extremely, high, viscosity, shear, resisting, liquids, some, large, scale, non, fuel, applications, of, hydrocarbons, begin, with, ethane, and, propane, which, are, obtained, from, petroleum, and, natural, gas, these, two, gases, are, converted, either, to, syngas, or, to, ethylene, and, propylene, respectively, global, consumption, of, benzene, in, 2021, is, estimated, at, more, than, 58, million, metric, tons, which, will, increase, to, 60, million, tons, in, 2022, hydrocarbons, are, also, prevalent, in, nature, some, eusocial, arthropods, such, as, the, brazilian, stingless, bee, schwarziana, quadripunctata, use, unique, cuticular, hydrocarbon, scents, in, order, to, determine, kin, from, non, kin, this, hydrocarbon, composition, varies, between, age, sex, nest, location, and, hierarchal, position, there, is, also, potential, to, harvest, hydrocarbons, from, plants, like, euphorbia, lathyris, and, e, tirucalli, as, an, alternative, and, renewable, energy, source, for, vehicles, that, use, diesel, furthermore, endophytic, bacteria, from, plants, that, naturally, produce, hydrocarbons, have, been, used, in, hydrocarbon, degradation, in, attempts, to, deplete, hydrocarbon, concentration, in, polluted, soils, the, noteworthy, feature, of, saturated, hydrocarbons, is, their, inertness, unsaturated, hydrocarbons, alkanes, alkenes, and, aromatic, compounds, react, more, readily, by, means, of, substitution, addition, polymerization, at, higher, temperatures, they, undergo, dehydrogenation, oxidation, and, combustion, of, the, classes, of, hydrocarbons, aromatic, compounds, uniquely, or, nearly, so, undergo, substitution, reactions, the, chemical, process, practiced, on, the, largest, scale, is, the, reaction, of, benzene, and, ethene, to, give, ethylbenzene, the, resulting, ethylbenzene, is, dehydrogenated, to, styrene, and, then, polymerized, to, manufacture, polystyrene, a, common, thermoplastic, material, substitution, reactions, occur, also, in, saturated, hydrocarbons, all, single, carbon, carbon, bonds, such, reactions, require, highly, reactive, reagents, such, as, chlorine, and, fluorine, in, the, case, of, chlorination, one, of, the, chlorine, atoms, replaces, a, hydrogen, atom, the, reactions, proceed, via, free, radical, pathways, in, which, the, halogen, first, dissociates, into, a, two, neutral, radical, atoms, homolytic, fission, all, the, way, to, ccl, 4, carbon, tetrachloride, all, the, way, to, c, 2, cl, 6, hexachloroethane, addition, reactions, apply, to, alkenes, and, alkynes, in, this, reaction, a, variety, of, reagents, add, across, the, pi, bond, s, chlorine, hydrogen, chloride, water, and, hydrogen, are, illustrative, reagents, alkenes, and, some, alkynes, also, undergo, polymerization, by, opening, of, the, multiple, bonds, to, produce, polyethylene, polybutylene, and, polystyrene, the, alkyne, acetylene, polymerizes, to, produce, polyacetylene, oligomers, chains, of, a, few, monomers, may, be, produced, for, example, in, the, shell, higher, olefin, process, where, olefins, are, extended, to, make, longer, olefins, by, adding, ethylene, repeatedly, some, hydrocarbons, undergo, metathesis, in, which, substituents, attached, by, c, c, bonds, are, exchanged, between, molecules, for, a, single, c, c, bond, it, is, alkane, metathesis, for, a, double, c, c, bond, it, is, alkene, metathesis, olefin, metathesis, and, for, a, triple, c, c, bond, it, is, alkyne, metathesis, combustion, of, hydrocarbons, is, currently, the, main, source, of, the, world, s, energy, for, electric, power, generation, heating, such, as, home, heating, and, transportation, often, this, energy, is, used, directly, as, heat, such, as, in, home, heaters, which, use, either, petroleum, or, natural, gas, the, hydrocarbon, is, burnt, and, the, heat, is, used, to, heat, water, which, is, then, circulated, a, similar, principle, is, used, to, create, electrical, energy, in, power, plants, common, properties, of, hydrocarbons, are, the, facts, that, they, produce, steam, carbon, dioxide, and, heat, during, combustion, and, that, oxygen, is, required, for, combustion, to, take, place, the, simplest, hydrocarbon, methane, burns, as, follows, in, inadequate, supply, of, air, carbon, black, and, water, vapour, are, formed, and, finally, for, any, linear, alkane, of, n, carbon, atoms, partial, oxidation, characterizes, the, reactions, of, alkenes, and, oxygen, this, process, is, the, basis, of, rancidification, and, paint, drying, benzene, burns, with, sooty, flame, when, heated, in, air, the, vast, majority, of, hydrocarbons, found, on, earth, occur, in, crude, oil, petroleum, coal, and, natural, gas, since, thousands, of, years, they, have, been, exploited, and, used, for, a, vast, range, of, purposes, petroleum, lit, rock, oil, and, coal, are, generally, thought, to, be, products, of, decomposition, of, organic, matter, coal, in, contrast, to, petroleum, is, richer, in, carbon, and, poorer, in, hydrogen, natural, gas, is, the, product, of, methanogenesis, a, seemingly, limitless, variety, of, compounds, comprise, petroleum, hence, the, necessity, of, refineries, these, hydrocarbons, consist, of, saturated, hydrocarbons, aromatic, hydrocarbons, or, combinations, of, the, two, missing, in, petroleum, are, alkenes, and, alkynes, their, production, requires, refineries, petroleum, derived, hydrocarbons, are, mainly, consumed, for, fuel, but, they, are, also, the, source, of, virtually, all, synthetic, organic, compounds, including, plastics, and, pharmaceuticals, natural, gas, is, consumed, almost, exclusively, as, fuel, coal, is, used, as, a, fuel, and, as, a, reducing, agent, in, metallurgy, a, small, fraction, of, hydrocarbon, found, on, earth, and, all, currently, known, hydrocarbon, found, on, other, planets, and, moons, is, thought, to, be, abiological, hydrocarbons, such, as, ethylene, isoprene, and, monoterpenes, are, emitted, by, living, vegetation, some, hydrocarbons, also, are, widespread, and, abundant, in, the, solar, system, lakes, of, liquid, methane, and, ethane, have, been, found, on, titan, saturn, s, largest, moon, as, confirmed, by, the, cassini, huygens, space, probe, hydrocarbons, are, also, abundant, in, nebulae, forming, polycyclic, aromatic, hydrocarbon, compounds, burning, hydrocarbons, as, fuel, which, produces, carbon, dioxide, and, water, is, a, major, contributor, to, anthropogenic, global, warming, hydrocarbons, are, introduced, into, the, environment, through, their, extensive, use, as, fuels, and, chemicals, as, well, as, through, leaks, or, accidental, spills, during, exploration, production, refining, or, transport, of, fossil, fuels, anthropogenic, hydrocarbon, contamination, of, soil, is, a, serious, global, issue, due, to, contaminant, persistence, and, the, negative, impact, on, human, health, when, soil, is, contaminated, by, hydrocarbons, it, can, have, a, significant, impact, on, its, microbiological, chemical, and, physical, properties, this, can, serve, to, prevent, slow, down, or, even, accelerate, the, growth, of, vegetation, depending, on, the, exact, changes, that, occur, crude, oil, and, natural, gas, are, the, two, largest, sources, of, hydrocarbon, contamination, of, soil, bioremediation, of, hydrocarbon, from, soil, or, water, contaminated, is, a, formidable, challenge, because, of, the, chemical, inertness, that, characterize, hydrocarbons, hence, they, survived, millions, of, years, in, the, source, rock, nonetheless, many, strategies, have, been, devised, bioremediation, being, prominent, the, basic, problem, with, bioremediation, is, the, paucity, of, enzymes, that, act, on, them, nonetheless, the, area, has, received, regular, attention, bacteria, in, the, gabbroic, layer, of, the, ocean, s, crust, can, degrade, hydrocarbons, but, the, extreme, environment, makes, research, difficult, other, bacteria, such, as, lutibacterium, anuloederans, can, also, degrade, hydrocarbons, mycoremediation, or, breaking, down, of, hydrocarbon, by, mycelium, and, mushrooms, is, possible, hydrocarbons, are, generally, of, low, toxicity, hence, the, widespread, use, of, gasoline, and, related, volatile, products, aromatic, compounds, such, as, benzene, and, toluene, are, narcotic, and, chronic, toxins, and, benzene, in, particular, is, known, to, be, carcinogenic, certain, rare, polycyclic, aromatic, compounds, are, carcinogenic, hydrocarbons, are, highly, flammable
