ultrasound, is, sound, with, frequencies, greater, than, 20, kilohertz, this, frequency, is, the, approximate, upper, audible, limit, of, human, hearing, in, healthy, young, adults, the, physical, principles, of, acoustic, waves, apply, to, any, frequency, range, including, ultrasound, ultrasonic, devices, operate, with, frequencies, from, 20, khz, up, to, several, gigahertz, ultrasound, is, used, in, many, different, fields, ultrasonic, devices, are, used, to, detect, objects, and, measure, distances, ultrasound, imaging, or, sonography, is, often, used, in, medicine, in, the, nondestructive, testing, of, products, and, structures, ultrasound, is, used, to, detect, invisible, flaws, industrially, ultrasound, is, used, for, cleaning, mixing, and, accelerating, chemical, processes, animals, such, as, bats, and, porpoises, use, ultrasound, for, locating, prey, and, obstacles, acoustics, the, science, of, sound, starts, as, far, back, as, pythagoras, in, the, 6th, century, bc, who, wrote, on, the, mathematical, properties, of, stringed, instruments, echolocation, in, bats, was, discovered, by, lazzaro, spallanzani, in, 1794, when, he, demonstrated, that, bats, hunted, and, navigated, by, inaudible, sound, not, vision, francis, galton, in, 1893, invented, the, galton, whistle, an, adjustable, whistle, that, produced, ultrasound, which, he, used, to, measure, the, hearing, range, of, humans, and, other, animals, demonstrating, that, many, animals, could, hear, sounds, above, the, hearing, range, of, humans, the, first, article, on, the, history, of, ultrasound, was, written, in, 1948, according, to, its, author, during, the, first, world, war, a, russian, engineer, named, chilowski, submitted, an, idea, for, submarine, detection, to, the, french, government, the, latter, invited, paul, langevin, then, director, of, the, school, of, physics, and, chemistry, in, paris, to, evaluate, it, chilowski, s, proposal, was, to, excite, a, cylindrical, mica, condenser, by, a, high, frequency, poulsen, arc, at, approximately, 100, khz, and, thus, to, generate, an, ultrasound, beam, for, detecting, submerged, objects, the, idea, of, locating, underwater, obstacles, had, been, suggested, prior, by, l, f, richardson, following, the, titanic, disaster, richardson, had, proposed, to, position, a, high, frequency, hydraulic, whistle, at, the, focus, of, a, mirror, and, use, the, beam, for, locating, submerged, navigational, hazards, a, prototype, was, built, by, sir, charles, parsons, the, inventor, of, the, vapour, turbine, but, the, device, was, found, not, to, be, suitable, for, this, purpose, langevin, s, device, made, use, of, the, piezoelectric, effect, which, he, had, been, acquainted, with, whilst, a, student, at, the, laboratory, of, jacques, and, pierre, curie, langevin, calculated, and, built, an, ultrasound, transducer, comprising, a, thin, sheet, of, quartz, sandwiched, between, two, steel, plates, langevin, was, the, first, to, report, cavitation, related, bioeffects, from, ultrasound, ultrasound, is, defined, by, the, american, national, standards, institute, as, sound, at, frequencies, greater, than, 20, khz, in, air, at, atmospheric, pressure, ultrasonic, waves, have, wavelengths, of, 1, 9, cm, or, less, ultrasound, can, be, generated, at, very, high, frequencies, ultrasound, is, used, for, sonochemistry, at, frequencies, up, to, multiple, hundreds, of, kilohertz, medical, imaging, equipment, uses, frequencies, in, the, mhz, range, uhf, ultrasound, waves, have, been, generated, as, high, as, the, gigahertz, range, characterizing, extremely, high, frequency, ultrasound, poses, challenges, as, such, rapid, movement, causes, waveforms, to, steepen, and, form, shock, waves, the, upper, frequency, limit, in, humans, approximately, 20, khz, is, due, to, limitations, of, the, middle, ear, auditory, sensation, can, occur, if, high, intensity, ultrasound, is, fed, directly, into, the, human, skull, and, reaches, the, cochlea, through, bone, conduction, without, passing, through, the, middle, ear, children, can, hear, some, high, pitched, sounds, that, older, adults, cannot, hear, because, in, humans, the, upper, limit, pitch, of, hearing, tends, to, decrease, with, age, an, american, cell, phone, company, has, used, this, to, create, ring, signals, that, supposedly, are, only, audible, to, younger, humans, but, many, older, people, can, hear, the, signals, which, may, be, because, of, the, considerable, variation, of, age, related, deterioration, in, the, upper, hearing, threshold, bats, use, a, variety, of, ultrasonic, ranging, echolocation, techniques, to, detect, their, prey, they, can, detect, frequencies, beyond, 100, khz, possibly, up, to, 200, khz, many, insects, have, good, ultrasonic, hearing, and, most, of, these, are, nocturnal, insects, listening, for, echolocating, bats, these, include, many, groups, of, moths, beetles, praying, mantises, and, lacewings, upon, hearing, a, bat, some, insects, will, make, evasive, manoeuvres, to, escape, being, caught, ultrasonic, frequencies, trigger, a, reflex, action, in, the, noctuid, moth, that, causes, it, to, drop, slightly, in, its, flight, to, evade, attack, tiger, moths, also, emit, clicks, which, may, disturb, bats, echolocation, and, in, other, cases, may, advertise, the, fact, that, they, are, poisonous, by, emitting, sound, dogs, and, cats, hearing, range, extends, into, the, ultrasound, the, top, end, of, a, dog, s, hearing, range, is, about, 45, khz, while, a, cat, s, is, 64, khz, the, wild, ancestors, of, cats, and, dogs, evolved, this, higher, hearing, range, to, hear, high, frequency, sounds, made, by, their, preferred, prey, small, rodents, a, dog, whistle, is, a, whistle, that, emits, ultrasound, used, for, training, and, calling, dogs, the, frequency, of, most, dog, whistles, is, within, the, range, of, 23, to, 54, khz, toothed, whales, including, dolphins, can, hear, ultrasound, and, use, such, sounds, in, their, navigational, system, biosonar, to, orient, and, to, capture, prey, porpoises, have, the, highest, known, upper, hearing, limit, at, around, 160, khz, several, types, of, fish, can, detect, ultrasound, in, the, order, clupeiformes, members, of, the, subfamily, alosinae, shad, have, been, shown, to, be, able, to, detect, sounds, up, to, 180, khz, while, the, other, subfamilies, e, g, herrings, can, hear, only, up, to, 4, khz, no, bird, species, have, been, reported, to, be, sensitive, to, ultrasound, commercial, ultrasonic, systems, have, been, sold, for, supposed, indoors, electronic, pest, control, and, outdoors, ultrasonic, algae, control, however, no, scientific, evidence, exists, on, the, success, of, such, devices, for, these, purposes, an, ultrasonic, level, or, sensing, system, requires, no, contact, with, the, target, for, many, processes, in, the, medical, pharmaceutical, military, and, general, industries, this, is, an, advantage, over, inline, sensors, that, may, contaminate, the, liquids, inside, a, vessel, or, tube, or, that, may, be, clogged, by, the, product, both, continuous, wave, and, pulsed, systems, are, used, the, principle, behind, a, pulsed, ultrasonic, technology, is, that, the, transmit, signal, consists, of, short, bursts, of, ultrasonic, energy, after, each, burst, the, electronics, looks, for, a, return, signal, within, a, small, window, of, time, corresponding, to, the, time, it, takes, for, the, energy, to, pass, through, the, vessel, only, a, signal, received, during, this, window, will, qualify, for, additional, signal, processing, a, popular, consumer, application, of, ultrasonic, ranging, was, the, polaroid, sx, 70, camera, which, included, a, lightweight, transducer, system, to, focus, the, camera, automatically, polaroid, later, licensed, this, ultrasound, technology, and, it, became, the, basis, of, a, variety, of, ultrasonic, products, a, common, ultrasound, application, is, an, automatic, door, opener, where, an, ultrasonic, sensor, detects, a, person, s, approach, and, opens, the, door, ultrasonic, sensors, are, also, used, to, detect, intruders, the, ultrasound, can, cover, a, wide, area, from, a, single, point, the, flow, in, pipes, or, open, channels, can, be, measured, by, ultrasonic, flowmeters, which, measure, the, average, velocity, of, flowing, liquid, in, rheology, an, acoustic, rheometer, relies, on, the, principle, of, ultrasound, in, fluid, mechanics, fluid, flow, can, be, measured, using, an, ultrasonic, flow, meter, ultrasonic, testing, is, a, type, of, nondestructive, testing, commonly, used, to, find, flaws, in, materials, and, to, measure, the, thickness, of, objects, frequencies, of, 2, to, 10, mhz, are, common, but, for, special, purposes, other, frequencies, are, used, inspection, may, be, manual, or, automated, and, is, an, essential, part, of, modern, manufacturing, processes, most, metals, can, be, inspected, as, well, as, plastics, and, aerospace, composites, lower, frequency, ultrasound, 50, 500, khz, can, also, be, used, to, inspect, less, dense, materials, such, as, wood, concrete, and, cement, ultrasound, inspection, of, welded, joints, has, been, an, alternative, to, radiography, for, nondestructive, testing, since, the, 1960s, ultrasonic, inspection, eliminates, the, use, of, ionizing, radiation, with, safety, and, cost, benefits, ultrasound, can, also, provide, additional, information, such, as, the, depth, of, flaws, in, a, welded, joint, ultrasonic, inspection, has, progressed, from, manual, methods, to, computerized, systems, that, automate, much, of, the, process, an, ultrasonic, test, of, a, joint, can, identify, the, existence, of, flaws, measure, their, size, and, identify, their, location, not, all, welded, materials, are, equally, amenable, to, ultrasonic, inspection, some, materials, have, a, large, grain, size, that, produces, a, high, level, of, background, noise, in, measurements, ultrasonic, thickness, measurement, is, one, technique, used, to, monitor, quality, of, welds, a, common, use, of, ultrasound, is, in, underwater, range, finding, this, use, is, also, called, sonar, an, ultrasonic, pulse, is, generated, in, a, particular, direction, if, there, is, an, object, in, the, path, of, this, pulse, part, or, all, of, the, pulse, will, be, reflected, back, to, the, transmitter, as, an, echo, and, can, be, detected, through, the, receiver, path, by, measuring, the, difference, in, time, between, the, pulse, being, transmitted, and, the, echo, being, received, it, is, possible, to, determine, the, distance, the, measured, travel, time, of, sonar, pulses, in, water, is, strongly, dependent, on, the, temperature, and, the, salinity, of, the, water, ultrasonic, ranging, is, also, applied, for, measurement, in, air, and, for, short, distances, for, example, hand, held, ultrasonic, measuring, tools, can, rapidly, measure, the, layout, of, rooms, although, range, finding, underwater, is, performed, at, both, sub, audible, and, audible, frequencies, for, great, distances, 1, to, several, kilometers, ultrasonic, range, finding, is, used, when, distances, are, shorter, and, the, accuracy, of, the, distance, measurement, is, desired, to, be, finer, ultrasonic, measurements, may, be, limited, through, barrier, layers, with, large, salinity, temperature, or, vortex, differentials, ranging, in, water, varies, from, about, hundreds, to, thousands, of, meters, but, can, be, performed, with, centimeters, to, meters, accuracy, ultrasound, identification, usid, is, a, real, time, locating, system, rtls, or, indoor, positioning, system, ips, technology, used, to, automatically, track, and, identify, the, location, of, objects, in, real, time, using, simple, inexpensive, nodes, badges, tags, attached, to, or, embedded, in, objects, and, devices, which, then, transmit, an, ultrasound, signal, to, communicate, their, location, to, microphone, sensors, the, potential, for, ultrasonic, imaging, of, objects, in, which, a, 3, ghz, sound, wave, could, produce, resolution, comparable, to, an, optical, image, was, recognized, by, sergei, sokolov, in, 1939, such, frequencies, were, not, possible, at, the, time, and, what, technology, did, exist, produced, relatively, low, contrast, images, with, poor, sensitivity, ultrasonic, imaging, uses, frequencies, of, 2, megahertz, and, higher, the, shorter, wavelength, allows, resolution, of, small, internal, details, in, structures, and, tissues, the, power, density, is, generally, less, than, 1, watt, per, square, centimetre, to, avoid, heating, and, cavitation, effects, in, the, object, under, examination, ultrasonic, imaging, applications, include, industrial, nondestructive, testing, quality, control, and, medical, uses, acoustic, microscopy, is, the, technique, of, using, sound, waves, to, visualize, structures, too, small, to, be, resolved, by, the, human, eye, high, and, ultra, high, frequencies, up, to, several, gigahertz, are, used, in, acoustic, microscopes, the, reflection, and, diffraction, of, sound, waves, from, microscopic, structures, can, yield, information, not, available, with, light, medical, ultrasound, is, an, ultrasound, based, diagnostic, medical, imaging, technique, used, to, visualize, muscles, tendons, and, many, internal, organs, to, capture, their, size, structure, and, any, pathological, lesions, with, real, time, tomographic, images, ultrasound, has, been, used, by, radiologists, and, sonographers, to, image, the, human, body, for, at, least, 50, years, and, has, become, a, widely, used, diagnostic, tool, the, technology, is, relatively, inexpensive, and, portable, especially, when, compared, with, other, techniques, such, as, magnetic, resonance, imaging, mri, and, computed, tomography, ct, ultrasound, is, also, used, to, visualize, fetuses, during, routine, and, emergency, prenatal, care, such, diagnostic, applications, used, during, pregnancy, are, referred, to, as, obstetric, sonography, as, currently, applied, in, the, medical, field, properly, performed, ultrasound, poses, no, known, risks, to, the, patient, sonography, does, not, use, ionizing, radiation, and, the, power, levels, used, for, imaging, are, too, low, to, cause, adverse, heating, or, pressure, effects, in, tissue, although, the, long, term, effects, due, to, ultrasound, exposure, at, diagnostic, intensity, are, still, unknown, currently, most, doctors, feel, that, the, benefits, to, patients, outweigh, the, risks, the, alara, as, low, as, reasonably, achievable, principle, has, been, advocated, for, an, ultrasound, examination, that, is, keeping, the, scanning, time, and, power, settings, as, low, as, possible, but, consistent, with, diagnostic, imaging, and, that, by, that, principle, nonmedical, uses, which, by, definition, are, not, necessary, are, actively, discouraged, ultrasound, is, also, increasingly, being, used, in, trauma, and, first, aid, cases, with, emergency, ultrasound, being, used, by, some, emt, response, teams, furthermore, ultrasound, is, used, in, remote, diagnosis, cases, where, teleconsultation, is, required, such, as, scientific, experiments, in, space, or, mobile, sports, team, diagnosis, according, to, radiologyinfo, ultrasounds, are, useful, in, the, detection, of, pelvic, abnormalities, and, can, involve, techniques, known, as, abdominal, transabdominal, ultrasound, vaginal, transvaginal, or, endovaginal, ultrasound, in, women, and, also, rectal, transrectal, ultrasound, in, men, diagnostic, ultrasound, is, used, externally, in, horses, for, evaluation, of, soft, tissue, and, tendon, injuries, and, internally, in, particular, for, reproductive, work, evaluation, of, the, reproductive, tract, of, the, mare, and, pregnancy, detection, it, may, also, be, used, in, an, external, manner, in, stallions, for, evaluation, of, testicular, condition, and, diameter, as, well, as, internally, for, reproductive, evaluation, deferent, duct, etc, by, 2005, ultrasound, technology, began, to, be, used, by, the, beef, cattle, industry, to, improve, animal, health, and, the, yield, of, cattle, operations, ultrasound, is, used, to, evaluate, fat, thickness, rib, eye, area, and, intramuscular, fat, in, living, animals, it, is, also, used, to, evaluate, the, health, and, characteristics, of, unborn, calves, ultrasound, technology, provides, a, means, for, cattle, producers, to, obtain, information, that, can, be, used, to, improve, the, breeding, and, husbandry, of, cattle, the, technology, can, be, expensive, and, it, requires, a, substantial, time, commitment, for, continuous, data, collection, and, operator, training, nevertheless, this, technology, has, proven, useful, in, managing, and, running, a, cattle, breeding, operation, high, power, applications, of, ultrasound, often, use, frequencies, between, 20, khz, and, a, few, hundred, khz, intensities, can, be, very, high, above, 10, watts, per, square, centimeter, cavitation, can, be, inducted, in, liquid, media, and, some, applications, use, up, to, 1000, watts, per, square, centimeter, such, high, intensities, can, induce, chemical, changes, or, produce, significant, effects, by, direct, mechanical, action, and, can, inactivate, harmful, microorganisms, ultrasound, has, been, used, since, the, 1940s, by, physical, and, occupational, therapists, for, treating, connective, tissue, ligaments, tendons, and, fascia, and, also, scar, tissue, conditions, for, which, ultrasound, may, be, used, for, treatment, include, the, follow, examples, ligament, sprains, muscle, strains, tendonitis, joint, inflammation, plantar, fasciitis, metatarsalgia, facet, irritation, impingement, syndrome, bursitis, rheumatoid, arthritis, osteoarthritis, and, scar, tissue, adhesion, relatively, high, power, ultrasound, can, break, up, stony, deposits, or, tissue, increase, skin, permeability, accelerate, the, effect, of, drugs, in, a, targeted, area, assist, in, the, measurement, of, the, elastic, properties, of, tissue, and, can, be, used, to, sort, cells, or, small, particles, for, research, ultrasonic, impact, treatment, uit, uses, ultrasound, to, enhance, the, mechanical, and, physical, properties, of, metals, it, is, a, metallurgical, processing, technique, in, which, ultrasonic, energy, is, applied, to, a, metal, object, ultrasonic, treatment, can, result, in, controlled, residual, compressive, stress, grain, refinement, and, grain, size, reduction, low, and, high, cycle, fatigue, are, enhanced, and, have, been, documented, to, provide, increases, up, to, ten, times, greater, than, non, uit, specimens, additionally, uit, has, proven, effective, in, addressing, stress, corrosion, cracking, corrosion, fatigue, and, related, issues, when, the, uit, tool, made, up, of, the, ultrasonic, transducer, pins, and, other, components, comes, into, contact, with, the, work, piece, it, acoustically, couples, with, the, work, piece, creating, harmonic, resonance, this, harmonic, resonance, is, performed, at, a, carefully, calibrated, frequency, to, which, metals, respond, very, favorably, depending, on, the, desired, effects, of, treatment, a, combination, of, different, frequencies, and, displacement, amplitude, is, applied, these, frequencies, range, between, 25, and, 55, khz, with, the, displacement, amplitude, of, the, resonant, body, of, between, 22, and, 50, m, 0, 00087, and, 0, 0020, in, uit, devices, rely, on, magnetostrictive, transducers, ultrasonication, offers, great, potential, in, the, processing, of, liquids, and, slurries, by, improving, the, mixing, and, chemical, reactions, in, various, applications, and, industries, ultrasonication, generates, alternating, low, pressure, and, high, pressure, waves, in, liquids, leading, to, the, formation, and, violent, collapse, of, small, vacuum, bubbles, this, phenomenon, is, termed, cavitation, and, causes, high, speed, impinging, liquid, jets, and, strong, hydrodynamic, shear, forces, these, effects, are, used, for, the, deagglomeration, and, milling, of, micrometre, and, nanometre, size, materials, as, well, as, for, the, disintegration, of, cells, or, the, mixing, of, reactants, in, this, aspect, ultrasonication, is, an, alternative, to, high, speed, mixers, and, agitator, bead, mills, ultrasonic, foils, under, the, moving, wire, in, a, paper, machine, will, use, the, shock, waves, from, the, imploding, bubbles, to, distribute, the, cellulose, fibres, more, uniformly, in, the, produced, paper, web, which, will, make, a, stronger, paper, with, more, even, surfaces, furthermore, chemical, reactions, benefit, from, the, free, radicals, created, by, the, cavitation, as, well, as, from, the, energy, input, and, the, material, transfer, through, boundary, layers, for, many, processes, this, sonochemical, see, sonochemistry, effect, leads, to, a, substantial, reduction, in, the, reaction, time, like, in, the, transesterification, of, oil, into, biodiesel, substantial, ultrasonic, intensity, and, high, ultrasonic, vibration, amplitudes, are, required, for, many, processing, applications, such, as, nano, crystallization, nano, emulsification, deagglomeration, extraction, cell, disruption, as, well, as, many, others, commonly, a, process, is, first, tested, on, a, laboratory, scale, to, prove, feasibility, and, establish, some, of, the, required, ultrasonic, exposure, parameters, after, this, phase, is, complete, the, process, is, transferred, to, a, pilot, bench, scale, for, flow, through, pre, production, optimization, and, then, to, an, industrial, scale, for, continuous, production, during, these, scale, up, steps, it, is, essential, to, make, sure, that, all, local, exposure, conditions, ultrasonic, amplitude, cavitation, intensity, time, spent, in, the, active, cavitation, zone, etc, stay, the, same, if, this, condition, is, met, the, quality, of, the, final, product, remains, at, the, optimized, level, while, the, productivity, is, increased, by, a, predictable, scale, up, factor, the, productivity, increase, results, from, the, fact, that, laboratory, bench, and, industrial, scale, ultrasonic, processor, systems, incorporate, progressively, larger, ultrasonic, horns, able, to, generate, progressively, larger, high, intensity, cavitation, zones, and, therefore, to, process, more, material, per, unit, of, time, this, is, called, direct, scalability, it, is, important, to, point, out, that, increasing, the, power, of, the, ultrasonic, processor, alone, does, not, result, in, direct, scalability, since, it, may, be, and, frequently, is, accompanied, by, a, reduction, in, the, ultrasonic, amplitude, and, cavitation, intensity, during, direct, scale, up, all, processing, conditions, must, be, maintained, while, the, power, rating, of, the, equipment, is, increased, in, order, to, enable, the, operation, of, a, larger, ultrasonic, horn, a, researcher, at, the, industrial, materials, research, institute, alessandro, malutta, devised, an, experiment, that, demonstrated, the, trapping, action, of, ultrasonic, standing, waves, on, wood, pulp, fibers, diluted, in, water, and, their, parallel, orienting, into, the, equidistant, pressure, planes, the, time, to, orient, the, fibers, in, equidistant, planes, is, measured, with, a, laser, and, an, electro, optical, sensor, this, could, provide, the, paper, industry, a, quick, on, line, fiber, size, measurement, system, a, somewhat, different, implementation, was, demonstrated, at, pennsylvania, state, university, using, a, microchip, which, generated, a, pair, of, perpendicular, standing, surface, acoustic, waves, allowing, to, position, particles, equidistant, to, each, other, on, a, grid, this, experiment, called, acoustic, tweezers, can, be, used, for, applications, in, material, sciences, biology, physics, chemistry, and, nanotechnology, ultrasonic, cleaners, sometimes, mistakenly, called, supersonic, cleaners, are, used, at, frequencies, from, 20, to, 40, khz, for, jewellery, lenses, and, other, optical, parts, watches, dental, instruments, surgical, instruments, diving, regulators, and, industrial, parts, an, ultrasonic, cleaner, works, mostly, by, energy, released, from, the, collapse, of, millions, of, microscopic, cavitation, bubbles, near, the, dirty, surface, the, collapsing, bubbles, form, tiny, shockwaves, that, break, up, and, disperse, contaminants, on, the, object, s, surface, similar, to, ultrasonic, cleaning, biological, cells, including, bacteria, can, be, disintegrated, high, power, ultrasound, produces, cavitation, that, facilitates, particle, disintegration, or, reactions, this, has, uses, in, biological, science, for, analytical, or, chemical, purposes, sonication, and, sonoporation, and, in, killing, bacteria, in, sewage, high, power, ultrasound, can, disintegrate, corn, slurry, and, enhance, liquefaction, and, saccharification, for, higher, ethanol, yield, in, dry, corn, milling, plants, the, ultrasonic, humidifier, one, type, of, nebulizer, a, device, that, creates, a, very, fine, spray, is, a, popular, type, of, humidifier, it, works, by, vibrating, a, metal, plate, at, ultrasonic, frequencies, to, nebulize, sometimes, incorrectly, called, atomize, the, water, because, the, water, is, not, heated, for, evaporation, it, produces, a, cool, mist, the, ultrasonic, pressure, waves, nebulize, not, only, the, water, but, also, materials, in, the, water, including, calcium, other, minerals, viruses, fungi, bacteria, and, other, impurities, illness, caused, by, impurities, that, reside, in, a, humidifier, s, reservoir, fall, under, the, heading, of, humidifier, fever, ultrasonic, humidifiers, are, frequently, used, in, aeroponics, where, they, are, generally, referred, to, as, foggers, in, ultrasonic, welding, of, plastics, high, frequency, 15, khz, to, 40, khz, low, amplitude, vibration, is, used, to, create, heat, by, way, of, friction, between, the, materials, to, be, joined, the, interface, of, the, two, parts, is, specially, designed, to, concentrate, the, energy, for, maximum, weld, strength, power, ultrasound, in, the, 20, 100, khz, range, is, used, in, chemistry, the, ultrasound, does, not, interact, directly, with, molecules, to, induce, the, chemical, change, as, its, typical, wavelength, in, the, millimeter, range, is, too, long, compared, to, the, molecules, instead, the, energy, causes, cavitation, which, generates, extremes, of, temperature, and, pressure, in, the, liquid, where, the, reaction, happens, ultrasound, also, breaks, up, solids, and, removes, passivating, layers, of, inert, material, to, give, a, larger, surface, area, for, the, reaction, to, occur, over, both, of, these, effects, make, the, reaction, faster, in, 2008, atul, kumar, reported, synthesis, of, hantzsch, esters, and, polyhydroquinoline, derivatives, via, multi, component, reaction, protocol, in, aqueous, micelles, using, ultrasound, ultrasound, is, used, in, extraction, using, different, frequencies, when, applied, in, specific, configurations, ultrasound, can, produce, short, bursts, of, light, in, a, phenomenon, known, as, sonoluminescence, ultrasound, is, used, when, characterizing, particulates, through, the, technique, of, ultrasound, attenuation, spectroscopy, or, by, observing, electroacoustic, phenomena, or, by, transcranial, pulsed, ultrasound, audio, can, be, propagated, by, modulated, ultrasound, a, formerly, popular, consumer, application, of, ultrasound, was, in, television, remote, controls, for, adjusting, volume, and, changing, channels, introduced, by, zenith, in, the, late, 1950s, the, system, used, a, hand, held, remote, control, containing, short, rod, resonators, struck, by, small, hammers, and, a, microphone, on, the, set, filters, and, detectors, discriminated, between, the, various, operations, the, principal, advantages, were, that, no, battery, was, needed, in, the, hand, held, control, box, and, unlike, radio, waves, the, ultrasound, was, unlikely, to, affect, neighboring, sets, ultrasound, remained, in, use, until, displaced, by, infrared, systems, starting, in, the, late, 1980s, in, july, 2015, the, economist, reported, that, researchers, at, the, university, of, california, berkeley, have, conducted, ultrasound, studies, using, graphene, diaphragms, the, thinness, and, low, weight, of, graphene, combined, with, its, strength, make, it, an, effective, material, to, use, in, ultrasound, communications, one, suggested, application, of, the, technology, would, be, underwater, communications, where, radio, waves, typically, do, not, travel, well, ultrasonic, signals, have, been, used, in, audio, beacons, for, cross, device, tracking, of, internet, users, occupational, exposure, to, ultrasound, in, excess, of, 120, db, may, lead, to, hearing, loss, exposure, in, excess, of, 155, db, may, produce, heating, effects, that, are, harmful, to, the, human, body, and, it, has, been, calculated, that, exposures, above, 180, db, may, lead, to, death, the, uk, s, independent, advisory, group, on, non, ionising, radiation, agnir, produced, a, report, in, 2010, which, was, published, by, the, uk, health, protection, agency, hpa, this, report, recommended, an, exposure, limit, for, the, general, public, to, airborne, ultrasound, sound, pressure, levels, spl, of, 70, db, at, 20, khz, and, 100, db, at, 25, khz, and, above, in, medical, ultrasound, guidelines, exist, to, prevent, inertial, cavitation, from, happening, the, risk, of, inertial, cavitation, damage, is, expressed, by, the, mechanical, index
