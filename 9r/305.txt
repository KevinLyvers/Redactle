combustion, or, burning, is, a, high, temperature, exothermic, redox, chemical, reaction, between, a, fuel, the, reductant, and, an, oxidant, usually, atmospheric, oxygen, that, produces, oxidized, often, gaseous, products, in, a, mixture, termed, as, smoke, combustion, does, not, always, result, in, fire, because, a, flame, is, only, visible, when, substances, undergoing, combustion, vaporize, but, when, it, does, a, flame, is, a, characteristic, indicator, of, the, reaction, while, activation, energy, must, be, supplied, to, initiate, combustion, e, g, using, a, lit, match, to, light, a, fire, the, heat, from, a, flame, may, provide, enough, energy, to, make, the, reaction, self, sustaining, the, study, of, combustion, is, known, as, combustion, science, combustion, is, often, a, complicated, sequence, of, elementary, radical, reactions, solid, fuels, such, as, wood, and, coal, first, undergo, endothermic, pyrolysis, to, produce, gaseous, fuels, whose, combustion, then, supplies, the, heat, required, to, produce, more, of, them, combustion, is, often, hot, enough, that, incandescent, light, in, the, form, of, either, glowing, or, a, flame, is, produced, a, simple, example, can, be, seen, in, the, combustion, of, hydrogen, and, oxygen, into, water, vapor, a, reaction, which, is, commonly, used, to, fuel, rocket, engines, this, reaction, releases, 242, kj, mol, of, heat, and, reduces, the, enthalpy, accordingly, at, constant, temperature, and, pressure, uncatalyzed, combustion, in, air, requires, relatively, high, temperatures, complete, combustion, is, stoichiometric, concerning, the, fuel, where, there, is, no, remaining, fuel, and, ideally, no, residual, oxidant, thermodynamically, the, chemical, equilibrium, of, combustion, in, air, is, overwhelmingly, on, the, side, of, the, products, however, complete, combustion, is, almost, impossible, to, achieve, since, the, chemical, equilibrium, is, not, necessarily, reached, or, may, contain, unburnt, products, such, as, carbon, monoxide, hydrogen, and, even, carbon, soot, or, ash, thus, the, produced, smoke, is, usually, toxic, and, contains, unburned, or, partially, oxidized, products, any, combustion, at, high, temperatures, in, atmospheric, air, which, is, 78, percent, nitrogen, will, also, create, small, amounts, of, several, nitrogen, oxides, commonly, referred, to, as, nox, since, the, combustion, of, nitrogen, is, thermodynamically, favored, at, high, but, not, low, temperatures, since, burning, is, rarely, clean, fuel, gas, cleaning, or, catalytic, converters, may, be, required, by, law, fires, occur, naturally, ignited, by, lightning, strikes, or, by, volcanic, products, combustion, fire, was, the, first, controlled, chemical, reaction, discovered, by, humans, in, the, form, of, campfires, and, bonfires, and, continues, to, be, the, main, method, to, produce, energy, for, humanity, usually, the, fuel, is, carbon, hydrocarbons, or, more, complicated, mixtures, such, as, wood, that, contain, partially, oxidized, hydrocarbons, the, thermal, energy, produced, from, the, combustion, of, either, fossil, fuels, such, as, coal, or, oil, or, from, renewable, fuels, such, as, firewood, is, harvested, for, diverse, uses, such, as, cooking, production, of, electricity, or, industrial, or, domestic, heating, combustion, is, also, currently, the, only, reaction, used, to, power, rockets, combustion, is, also, used, to, destroy, incinerate, waste, both, nonhazardous, and, hazardous, oxidants, for, combustion, have, high, oxidation, potential, and, include, atmospheric, or, pure, oxygen, chlorine, fluorine, chlorine, trifluoride, nitrous, oxide, and, nitric, acid, for, instance, hydrogen, burns, in, chlorine, to, form, hydrogen, chloride, with, the, liberation, of, heat, and, light, characteristic, of, combustion, although, usually, not, catalyzed, combustion, can, be, catalyzed, by, platinum, or, vanadium, as, in, the, contact, process, in, complete, combustion, the, reactant, burns, in, oxygen, and, produces, a, limited, number, of, products, when, a, hydrocarbon, burns, in, oxygen, the, reaction, will, primarily, yield, carbon, dioxide, and, water, when, elements, are, burned, the, products, are, primarily, the, most, common, oxides, carbon, will, yield, carbon, dioxide, sulfur, will, yield, sulfur, dioxide, and, iron, will, yield, iron, iii, oxide, nitrogen, is, not, considered, to, be, a, combustible, substance, when, oxygen, is, the, oxidant, still, small, amounts, of, various, nitrogen, oxides, commonly, designated, no, x, species, form, when, the, air, is, the, oxidative, combustion, is, not, necessarily, favorable, to, the, maximum, degree, of, oxidation, and, it, can, be, temperature, dependent, for, example, sulfur, trioxide, is, not, produced, quantitatively, by, the, combustion, of, sulfur, no, x, species, appear, in, significant, amounts, above, about, 2, 800, f, 1, 540, c, and, more, is, produced, at, higher, temperatures, the, amount, of, no, x, is, also, a, function, of, oxygen, excess, in, most, industrial, applications, and, in, fires, air, is, the, source, of, oxygen, o, 2, in, the, air, each, mole, of, oxygen, is, mixed, with, approximately, 3, 71, mol, of, nitrogen, nitrogen, does, not, take, part, in, combustion, but, at, high, temperatures, some, nitrogen, will, be, converted, to, no, x, mostly, no, with, much, smaller, amounts, of, no, 2, on, the, other, hand, when, there, is, insufficient, oxygen, to, combust, the, fuel, completely, some, fuel, carbon, is, converted, to, carbon, monoxide, and, some, of, the, hydrogens, remain, unreacted, a, complete, set, of, equations, for, the, combustion, of, a, hydrocarbon, in, the, air, therefore, requires, an, additional, calculation, for, the, distribution, of, oxygen, between, the, carbon, and, hydrogen, in, the, fuel, the, amount, of, air, required, for, complete, combustion, is, known, as, the, theoretical, air, or, stoichiometric, air, the, amount, of, air, above, this, value, actually, needed, for, optimal, combustion, is, known, as, the, excess, air, and, can, vary, from, 5, for, a, natural, gas, boiler, to, 40, for, anthracite, coal, to, 300, for, a, gas, turbine, incomplete, combustion, will, occur, when, there, is, not, enough, oxygen, to, allow, the, fuel, to, react, completely, to, produce, carbon, dioxide, and, water, it, also, happens, when, the, combustion, is, quenched, by, a, heat, sink, such, as, a, solid, surface, or, flame, trap, as, is, the, case, with, complete, combustion, water, is, produced, by, incomplete, combustion, however, carbon, and, carbon, monoxide, are, produced, instead, of, carbon, dioxide, for, most, fuels, such, as, diesel, oil, coal, or, wood, pyrolysis, occurs, before, combustion, in, incomplete, combustion, products, of, pyrolysis, remain, unburnt, and, contaminate, the, smoke, with, noxious, particulate, matter, and, gases, partially, oxidized, compounds, are, also, a, concern, partial, oxidation, of, ethanol, can, produce, harmful, acetaldehyde, and, carbon, can, produce, toxic, carbon, monoxide, the, designs, of, combustion, devices, can, improve, the, quality, of, combustion, such, as, burners, and, internal, combustion, engines, further, improvements, are, achievable, by, catalytic, after, burning, devices, such, as, catalytic, converters, or, by, the, simple, partial, return, of, the, exhaust, gases, into, the, combustion, process, such, devices, are, required, by, environmental, legislation, for, cars, in, most, countries, they, may, be, necessary, to, enable, large, combustion, devices, such, as, thermal, power, stations, to, reach, legal, emission, standards, the, degree, of, combustion, can, be, measured, and, analyzed, with, test, equipment, hvac, contractors, firefighters, and, engineers, use, combustion, analyzers, to, test, the, efficiency, of, a, burner, during, the, combustion, process, also, the, efficiency, of, an, internal, combustion, engine, can, be, measured, in, this, way, and, some, u, s, states, and, local, municipalities, use, combustion, analysis, to, define, and, rate, the, efficiency, of, vehicles, on, the, road, today, carbon, monoxide, is, one, of, the, products, from, incomplete, combustion, the, formation, of, carbon, monoxide, produces, less, heat, than, formation, of, carbon, dioxide, so, complete, combustion, is, greatly, preferred, especially, as, carbon, monoxide, is, a, poisonous, gas, when, breathed, carbon, monoxide, takes, the, place, of, oxygen, and, combines, with, some, of, the, hemoglobin, in, the, blood, rendering, it, unable, to, transport, oxygen, these, oxides, combine, with, water, and, oxygen, in, the, atmosphere, creating, nitric, acid, and, sulfuric, acids, which, return, to, earth, s, surface, as, acid, deposition, or, acid, rain, acid, deposition, harms, aquatic, organisms, and, kills, trees, due, to, its, formation, of, certain, nutrients, that, are, less, available, to, plants, such, as, calcium, and, phosphorus, it, reduces, the, productivity, of, the, ecosystem, and, farms, an, additional, problem, associated, with, nitrogen, oxides, is, that, they, along, with, hydrocarbon, pollutants, contribute, to, the, formation, of, ground, level, ozone, a, major, component, of, smog, breathing, carbon, monoxide, causes, headache, dizziness, vomiting, and, nausea, if, carbon, monoxide, levels, are, high, enough, humans, become, unconscious, or, die, exposure, to, moderate, and, high, levels, of, carbon, monoxide, over, long, periods, is, positively, correlated, with, the, risk, of, heart, disease, people, who, survive, severe, carbon, monoxide, poisoning, may, suffer, long, term, health, problems, carbon, monoxide, from, the, air, is, absorbed, in, the, lungs, which, then, binds, with, hemoglobin, in, human, s, red, blood, cells, this, reduces, the, capacity, of, red, blood, cells, that, carry, oxygen, throughout, the, body, smoldering, is, the, slow, low, temperature, flameless, form, of, combustion, sustained, by, the, heat, evolved, when, oxygen, directly, attacks, the, surface, of, a, condensed, phase, fuel, it, is, a, typically, incomplete, combustion, reaction, solid, materials, that, can, sustain, a, smoldering, reaction, include, coal, cellulose, wood, cotton, tobacco, peat, duff, humus, synthetic, foams, charring, polymers, including, polyurethane, foam, and, dust, common, examples, of, smoldering, phenomena, are, the, initiation, of, residential, fires, on, upholstered, furniture, by, weak, heat, sources, e, g, a, cigarette, a, short, circuited, wire, and, the, persistent, combustion, of, biomass, behind, the, flaming, fronts, of, wildfires, spontaneous, combustion, is, a, type, of, combustion, that, occurs, by, self, heating, increase, in, temperature, due, to, exothermic, internal, reactions, followed, by, thermal, runaway, self, heating, which, rapidly, accelerates, to, high, temperatures, and, finally, ignition, for, example, phosphorus, self, ignites, at, room, temperature, without, the, application, of, heat, organic, materials, undergoing, bacterial, composting, can, generate, enough, heat, to, reach, the, point, of, combustion, combustion, resulting, in, a, turbulent, flame, is, the, most, used, for, industrial, applications, e, g, gas, turbines, gasoline, engines, etc, because, the, turbulence, helps, the, mixing, process, between, the, fuel, and, oxidizer, the, term, micro, gravity, refers, to, a, gravitational, state, that, is, low, i, e, micro, in, the, sense, of, small, and, not, necessarily, a, millionth, of, earth, s, normal, gravity, such, that, the, influence, of, buoyancy, on, physical, processes, may, be, considered, small, relative, to, other, flow, processes, that, would, be, present, at, normal, gravity, in, such, an, environment, the, thermal, and, flow, transport, dynamics, can, behave, quite, differently, than, in, normal, gravity, conditions, e, g, a, candle, s, flame, takes, the, shape, of, a, sphere, microgravity, combustion, research, contributes, to, the, understanding, of, a, wide, variety, of, aspects, that, are, relevant, to, both, the, environment, of, a, spacecraft, e, g, fire, dynamics, relevant, to, crew, safety, on, the, international, space, station, and, terrestrial, earth, based, conditions, e, g, droplet, combustion, dynamics, to, assist, developing, new, fuel, blends, for, improved, combustion, materials, fabrication, processes, thermal, management, of, electronic, systems, multiphase, flow, boiling, dynamics, and, many, others, combustion, processes, that, happen, in, very, small, volumes, are, considered, micro, combustion, the, high, surface, to, volume, ratio, increases, specific, heat, loss, quenching, distance, plays, a, vital, role, in, stabilizing, the, flame, in, such, combustion, chambers, generally, the, chemical, equation, for, stoichiometric, combustion, of, a, hydrocarbon, in, oxygen, is, for, example, the, stoichiometric, combustion, of, methane, in, oxygen, is, if, the, stoichiometric, combustion, takes, place, using, air, as, the, oxygen, source, the, nitrogen, present, in, the, air, atmosphere, of, earth, can, be, added, to, the, equation, although, it, does, not, react, to, show, the, stoichiometric, composition, of, the, fuel, in, air, and, the, composition, of, the, resultant, flue, gas, treating, all, non, oxygen, components, in, air, as, nitrogen, gives, a, nitrogen, to, oxygen, ratio, of, 3, 77, i, e, 100, o, 2, o, 2, where, o, 2, is, 20, 95, vol, where, z, x, y, 4, displaystyle, z, x, y, over, 4, for, example, the, stoichiometric, combustion, of, methane, in, air, is, the, stoichiometric, composition, of, methane, in, air, is, 1, 1, 2, 7, 54, 9, 49, vol, the, stoichiometric, combustion, reaction, for, c, h, o, in, air, the, stoichiometric, combustion, reaction, for, c, h, o, s, the, stoichiometric, combustion, reaction, for, c, h, o, n, s, the, stoichiometric, combustion, reaction, for, c, h, o, f, various, other, substances, begin, to, appear, in, significant, amounts, in, combustion, products, when, the, flame, temperature, is, above, about, 1600, k, when, excess, air, is, used, nitrogen, may, oxidize, to, no, and, to, a, much, lesser, extent, to, no, 2, co, forms, by, disproportionation, of, co, 2, and, h, 2, and, oh, form, by, disproportionation, of, h, 2, o, for, example, when, 1, mol, of, propane, is, burned, with, 28, 6, mol, of, air, 120, of, the, stoichiometric, amount, the, combustion, products, contain, 3, 3, o, 2, at, 1400, k, the, equilibrium, combustion, products, contain, 0, 03, no, and, 0, 002, oh, at, 1800, k, the, combustion, products, contain, 0, 17, no, 0, 05, oh, 0, 01, co, and, 0, 004, h, 2, diesel, engines, are, run, with, an, excess, of, oxygen, to, combust, small, particles, that, tend, to, form, with, only, a, stoichiometric, amount, of, oxygen, necessarily, producing, nitrogen, oxide, emissions, both, the, united, states, and, european, union, enforce, limits, to, vehicle, nitrogen, oxide, emissions, which, necessitate, the, use, of, special, catalytic, converters, or, treatment, of, the, exhaust, with, urea, see, diesel, exhaust, fluid, the, incomplete, partial, combustion, of, a, hydrocarbon, with, oxygen, produces, a, gas, mixture, containing, mainly, co, 2, co, h, 2, o, and, h, 2, such, gas, mixtures, are, commonly, prepared, for, use, as, protective, atmospheres, for, the, heat, treatment, of, metals, and, for, gas, carburizing, the, general, reaction, equation, for, incomplete, combustion, of, one, mole, of, a, hydrocarbon, in, oxygen, is, when, z, falls, below, roughly, 50, of, the, stoichiometric, value, ch, 4, can, become, an, important, combustion, product, when, z, falls, below, roughly, 35, of, the, stoichiometric, value, elemental, carbon, may, become, stable, the, products, of, incomplete, combustion, can, be, calculated, with, the, aid, of, a, material, balance, together, with, the, assumption, that, the, combustion, products, reach, equilibrium, for, example, in, the, combustion, of, one, mole, of, propane, c, 3, h, 8, with, four, moles, of, o, 2, seven, moles, of, combustion, gas, are, formed, and, z, is, 80, of, the, stoichiometric, value, the, three, elemental, balance, equations, are, these, three, equations, are, insufficient, in, themselves, to, calculate, the, combustion, gas, composition, however, at, the, equilibrium, position, the, water, gas, shift, reaction, gives, another, equation, for, example, at, 1200, k, the, value, of, k, eq, is, 0, 728, solving, the, combustion, gas, consists, of, 42, 4, h, 2, o, 29, 0, co, 2, 14, 7, h, 2, and, 13, 9, co, carbon, becomes, a, stable, phase, at, 1200, k, and, 1, atm, pressure, when, z, is, less, than, 30, of, the, stoichiometric, value, at, which, point, the, combustion, products, contain, more, than, 98, h, 2, and, co, and, about, 0, 5, ch, 4, substances, or, materials, which, undergo, combustion, are, called, fuels, the, most, common, examples, are, natural, gas, propane, kerosene, diesel, petrol, charcoal, coal, wood, etc, combustion, of, a, liquid, fuel, in, an, oxidizing, atmosphere, actually, happens, in, the, gas, phase, it, is, the, vapor, that, burns, not, the, liquid, therefore, a, liquid, will, normally, catch, fire, only, above, a, certain, temperature, its, flash, point, the, flash, point, of, liquid, fuel, is, the, lowest, temperature, at, which, it, can, form, an, ignitable, mix, with, air, it, is, the, minimum, temperature, at, which, there, is, enough, evaporated, fuel, in, the, air, to, start, combustion, combustion, of, gaseous, fuels, may, occur, through, one, of, four, distinctive, types, of, burning, diffusion, flame, premixed, flame, autoignitive, reaction, front, or, as, a, detonation, the, type, of, burning, that, actually, occurs, depends, on, the, degree, to, which, the, fuel, and, oxidizer, are, mixed, prior, to, heating, for, example, a, diffusion, flame, is, formed, if, the, fuel, and, oxidizer, are, separated, initially, whereas, a, premixed, flame, is, formed, otherwise, similarly, the, type, of, burning, also, depends, on, the, pressure, a, detonation, for, example, is, an, autoignitive, reaction, front, coupled, to, a, strong, shock, wave, giving, it, its, characteristic, high, pressure, peak, and, high, detonation, velocity, the, act, of, combustion, consists, of, three, relatively, distinct, but, overlapping, phases, efficient, process, heating, requires, recovery, of, the, largest, possible, part, of, a, fuel, s, heat, of, combustion, into, the, material, being, processed, there, are, many, avenues, of, loss, in, the, operation, of, a, heating, process, typically, the, dominant, loss, is, sensible, heat, leaving, with, the, offgas, i, e, the, flue, gas, the, temperature, and, quantity, of, offgas, indicates, its, heat, content, enthalpy, so, keeping, its, quantity, low, minimizes, heat, loss, in, a, perfect, furnace, the, combustion, air, flow, would, be, matched, to, the, fuel, flow, to, give, each, fuel, molecule, the, exact, amount, of, oxygen, needed, to, cause, complete, combustion, however, in, the, real, world, combustion, does, not, proceed, in, a, perfect, manner, unburned, fuel, usually, co, and, h, 2, discharged, from, the, system, represents, a, heating, value, loss, as, well, as, a, safety, hazard, since, combustibles, are, undesirable, in, the, offgas, while, the, presence, of, unreacted, oxygen, there, presents, minimal, safety, and, environmental, concerns, the, first, principle, of, combustion, management, is, to, provide, more, oxygen, than, is, theoretically, needed, to, ensure, that, all, the, fuel, burns, for, methane, ch, 4, combustion, for, example, slightly, more, than, two, molecules, of, oxygen, are, required, the, second, principle, of, combustion, management, however, is, to, not, use, too, much, oxygen, the, correct, amount, of, oxygen, requires, three, types, of, measurement, first, active, control, of, air, and, fuel, flow, second, offgas, oxygen, measurement, and, third, measurement, of, offgas, combustibles, for, each, heating, process, there, exists, an, optimum, condition, of, minimal, offgas, heat, loss, with, acceptable, levels, of, combustibles, concentration, minimizing, excess, oxygen, pays, an, additional, benefit, for, a, given, offgas, temperature, the, nox, level, is, lowest, when, excess, oxygen, is, kept, lowest, adherence, to, these, two, principles, is, furthered, by, making, material, and, heat, balances, on, the, combustion, process, the, material, balance, directly, relates, the, air, fuel, ratio, to, the, percentage, of, o, 2, in, the, combustion, gas, the, heat, balance, relates, the, heat, available, for, the, charge, to, the, overall, net, heat, produced, by, fuel, combustion, additional, material, and, heat, balances, can, be, made, to, quantify, the, thermal, advantage, from, preheating, the, combustion, air, or, enriching, it, in, oxygen, combustion, in, oxygen, is, a, chain, reaction, in, which, many, distinct, radical, intermediates, participate, the, high, energy, required, for, initiation, is, explained, by, the, unusual, structure, of, the, dioxygen, molecule, the, lowest, energy, configuration, of, the, dioxygen, molecule, is, a, stable, relatively, unreactive, diradical, in, a, triplet, spin, state, bonding, can, be, described, with, three, bonding, electron, pairs, and, two, antibonding, electrons, with, spins, aligned, such, that, the, molecule, has, nonzero, total, angular, momentum, most, fuels, on, the, other, hand, are, in, a, singlet, state, with, paired, spins, and, zero, total, angular, momentum, interaction, between, the, two, is, quantum, mechanically, a, forbidden, transition, i, e, possible, with, a, very, low, probability, to, initiate, combustion, energy, is, required, to, force, dioxygen, into, a, spin, paired, state, or, singlet, oxygen, this, intermediate, is, extremely, reactive, the, energy, is, supplied, as, heat, and, the, reaction, then, produces, additional, heat, which, allows, it, to, continue, combustion, of, hydrocarbons, is, thought, to, be, initiated, by, hydrogen, atom, abstraction, not, proton, abstraction, from, the, fuel, to, oxygen, to, give, a, hydroperoxide, radical, hoo, this, reacts, further, to, give, hydroperoxides, which, break, up, to, give, hydroxyl, radicals, there, are, a, great, variety, of, these, processes, that, produce, fuel, radicals, and, oxidizing, radicals, oxidizing, species, include, singlet, oxygen, hydroxyl, monatomic, oxygen, and, hydroperoxyl, such, intermediates, are, short, lived, and, cannot, be, isolated, however, non, radical, intermediates, are, stable, and, are, produced, in, incomplete, combustion, an, example, is, acetaldehyde, produced, in, the, combustion, of, ethanol, an, intermediate, in, the, combustion, of, carbon, and, hydrocarbons, carbon, monoxide, is, of, special, importance, because, it, is, a, poisonous, gas, but, also, economically, useful, for, the, production, of, syngas, solid, and, heavy, liquid, fuels, also, undergo, a, great, number, of, pyrolysis, reactions, that, give, more, easily, oxidized, gaseous, fuels, these, reactions, are, endothermic, and, require, constant, energy, input, from, the, ongoing, combustion, reactions, a, lack, of, oxygen, or, other, improperly, designed, conditions, result, in, these, noxious, and, carcinogenic, pyrolysis, products, being, emitted, as, thick, black, smoke, the, rate, of, combustion, is, the, amount, of, a, material, that, undergoes, combustion, over, a, period, of, time, it, can, be, expressed, in, grams, per, second, g, s, or, kilograms, per, second, kg, s, detailed, descriptions, of, combustion, processes, from, the, chemical, kinetics, perspective, require, the, formulation, of, large, and, intricate, webs, of, elementary, reactions, for, instance, combustion, of, hydrocarbon, fuels, typically, involve, hundreds, of, chemical, species, reacting, according, to, thousands, of, reactions, the, inclusion, of, such, mechanisms, within, computational, flow, solvers, still, represents, a, pretty, challenging, task, mainly, in, two, aspects, first, the, number, of, degrees, of, freedom, proportional, to, the, number, of, chemical, species, can, be, dramatically, large, second, the, source, term, due, to, reactions, introduces, a, disparate, number, of, time, scales, which, makes, the, whole, dynamical, system, stiff, as, a, result, the, direct, numerical, simulation, of, turbulent, reactive, flows, with, heavy, fuels, soon, becomes, intractable, even, for, modern, supercomputers, therefore, a, plethora, of, methodologies, have, been, devised, for, reducing, the, complexity, of, combustion, mechanisms, without, resorting, to, high, detail, levels, examples, are, provided, by, the, kinetic, modelling, may, be, explored, for, insight, into, the, reaction, mechanisms, of, thermal, decomposition, in, the, combustion, of, different, materials, by, using, for, instance, thermogravimetric, analysis, assuming, perfect, combustion, conditions, such, as, complete, combustion, under, adiabatic, conditions, i, e, no, heat, loss, or, gain, the, adiabatic, combustion, temperature, can, be, determined, the, formula, that, yields, this, temperature, is, based, on, the, first, law, of, thermodynamics, and, takes, note, of, the, fact, that, the, heat, of, combustion, is, used, entirely, for, heating, the, fuel, the, combustion, air, or, oxygen, and, the, combustion, product, gases, commonly, referred, to, as, the, flue, gas, in, the, case, of, fossil, fuels, burnt, in, air, the, combustion, temperature, depends, on, all, of, the, following, the, adiabatic, combustion, temperature, also, known, as, the, adiabatic, flame, temperature, increases, for, higher, heating, values, and, inlet, air, and, fuel, temperatures, and, for, stoichiometric, air, ratios, approaching, one, most, commonly, the, adiabatic, combustion, temperatures, for, coals, are, around, 2, 200, c, 3, 992, f, for, inlet, air, and, fuel, at, ambient, temperatures, and, for, 1, 0, displaystyle, lambda, 1, 0, around, 2, 150, c, 3, 902, f, for, oil, and, 2, 000, c, 3, 632, f, for, natural, gas, in, industrial, fired, heaters, power, station, steam, generators, and, large, gas, fired, turbines, the, more, common, way, of, expressing, the, usage, of, more, than, the, stoichiometric, combustion, air, is, percent, excess, combustion, air, for, example, excess, combustion, air, of, 15, percent, means, that, 15, percent, more, than, the, required, stoichiometric, air, is, being, used, combustion, instabilities, are, typically, violent, pressure, oscillations, in, a, combustion, chamber, these, pressure, oscillations, can, be, as, high, as, 180, db, and, long, term, exposure, to, these, cyclic, pressure, and, thermal, loads, reduces, the, life, of, engine, components, in, rockets, such, as, the, f1, used, in, the, saturn, v, program, instabilities, led, to, massive, damage, to, the, combustion, chamber, and, surrounding, components, this, problem, was, solved, by, re,

in, ground, based, gas, turbine, engines, because, of, no, x, emissions, the, tendency, is, to, run, lean, an, equivalence, ratio, less, than, 1, to, reduce, the, combustion, temperature, and, thus, reduce, the, no, x, emissions, however, running, the, combustion, lean, makes, it, very, susceptible, to, combustion, instability, the, rayleigh, criterion, is, the, basis, for, analysis, of, thermoacoustic, combustion, instability, and, is, evaluated, using, the, rayleigh, index, over, one, cycle, of, instability, where, q, is, the, heat, release, rate, perturbation, and, p, is, the, pressure, fluctuation, when, the, heat, release, oscillations, are, in, phase, with, the, pressure, oscillations, the, rayleigh, index, is, positive, and, the, magnitude, of, the, thermoacoustic, instability, is, maximised, on, the, other, hand, if, the, rayleigh, index, is, negative, then, thermoacoustic, damping, occurs, the, rayleigh, criterion, implies, that, thermoacoustic, instability, can, be, optimally, controlled, by, having, heat, release, oscillations, 180, degrees, out, of, phase, with, pressure, oscillations, at, the, same, frequency, this, minimizes, the, rayleigh, index,
