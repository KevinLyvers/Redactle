the, cretaceous, paleogene, k, pg, extinction, event, also, known, as, the, cretaceous, tertiary, k, t, extinction, was, the, mass, extinction, of, three, quarters, of, the, plant, and, animal, species, on, earth, approximately, 66, million, years, ago, the, event, caused, the, extinction, of, all, non, avian, dinosaurs, most, other, tetrapods, weighing, more, than, 25, kilograms, 55, pounds, also, became, extinct, with, the, exception, of, some, ectothermic, species, such, as, sea, turtles, and, crocodilians, it, marked, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, period, and, with, it, the, mesozoic, era, while, heralding, the, beginning, of, the, current, era, the, cenozoic, in, the, geologic, record, the, k, pg, event, is, marked, by, a, thin, layer, of, sediment, called, the, k, pg, boundary, or, k, t, boundary, which, can, be, found, throughout, the, world, in, marine, and, terrestrial, rocks, the, boundary, clay, shows, unusually, high, levels, of, the, metal, iridium, which, is, more, common, in, asteroids, than, in, the, earth, s, crust, as, originally, proposed, in, 1980, by, a, team, of, scientists, led, by, luis, alvarez, and, his, son, walter, it, is, now, generally, thought, that, the, k, pg, extinction, was, caused, by, the, impact, of, a, massive, asteroid, 10, to, 15, km, 6, to, 9, mi, wide, 66, million, years, ago, which, devastated, the, global, environment, mainly, through, a, lingering, impact, winter, which, halted, photosynthesis, in, plants, and, plankton, the, impact, hypothesis, also, known, as, the, alvarez, hypothesis, was, bolstered, by, the, discovery, of, the, 180, km, 112, mi, chicxulub, crater, in, the, gulf, of, mexico, s, yucat, n, peninsula, in, the, early, 1990s, which, provided, conclusive, evidence, that, the, k, pg, boundary, clay, represented, debris, from, an, asteroid, impact, the, fact, that, the, extinctions, occurred, simultaneously, provides, strong, evidence, that, they, were, caused, by, the, asteroid, a, 2016, drilling, project, into, the, chicxulub, peak, ring, confirmed, that, the, peak, ring, comprised, granite, ejected, within, minutes, from, deep, in, the, earth, but, contained, hardly, any, gypsum, the, usual, sulfate, containing, sea, floor, rock, in, the, region, the, gypsum, would, have, vaporized, and, dispersed, as, an, aerosol, into, the, atmosphere, causing, longer, term, effects, on, the, climate, and, food, chain, in, october, 2019, researchers, asserted, that, the, event, rapidly, acidified, the, oceans, and, produced, long, lasting, effects, on, the, climate, detailing, the, mechanisms, of, the, mass, extinction, other, causal, or, contributing, factors, to, the, extinction, may, have, been, the, deccan, traps, and, other, volcanic, eruptions, climate, change, and, sea, level, change, however, in, january, 2020, scientists, reported, that, climate, modeling, of, the, extinction, event, favored, the, asteroid, impact, and, not, volcanism, a, wide, range, of, terrestrial, species, perished, in, the, k, pg, extinction, the, best, known, being, the, non, avian, dinosaurs, along, with, many, mammals, birds, lizards, insects, plants, and, all, the, pterosaurs, in, the, oceans, the, k, pg, extinction, killed, off, plesiosaurs, and, mosasaurs, and, devastated, teleost, fish, sharks, mollusks, especially, ammonites, which, became, extinct, and, many, species, of, plankton, it, is, estimated, that, 75, or, more, of, all, species, on, earth, vanished, however, the, extinction, also, provided, evolutionary, opportunities, in, its, wake, many, groups, underwent, remarkable, adaptive, radiation, sudden, and, prolific, divergence, into, new, forms, and, species, within, the, disrupted, and, emptied, ecological, niches, mammals, in, particular, diversified, in, the, paleogene, evolving, new, forms, such, as, horses, whales, bats, and, primates, the, surviving, group, of, dinosaurs, were, avians, a, few, species, of, ground, and, water, fowl, which, radiated, into, all, modern, species, of, birds, among, other, groups, teleost, fish, and, perhaps, lizards, also, radiated, the, k, pg, extinction, event, was, severe, global, rapid, and, selective, eliminating, a, vast, number, of, species, based, on, marine, fossils, it, is, estimated, that, 75, or, more, of, all, species, became, extinct, the, event, appears, to, have, affected, all, continents, at, the, same, time, non, avian, dinosaurs, for, example, are, known, from, the, maastrichtian, of, north, america, europe, asia, africa, south, america, and, antarctica, but, are, unknown, from, the, cenozoic, anywhere, in, the, world, similarly, fossil, pollen, shows, devastation, of, the, plant, communities, in, areas, as, far, apart, as, new, mexico, alaska, china, and, new, zealand, nevertheless, high, latitudes, appear, to, have, been, less, strongly, affected, than, low, latitudes, despite, the, event, s, severity, there, was, significant, variability, in, the, rate, of, extinction, between, and, within, different, clades, species, that, depended, on, photosynthesis, declined, or, became, extinct, as, atmospheric, particles, blocked, sunlight, and, reduced, the, solar, energy, reaching, the, ground, this, plant, extinction, caused, a, major, reshuffling, of, the, dominant, plant, groups, omnivores, insectivores, and, carrion, eaters, survived, the, extinction, event, perhaps, because, of, the, increased, availability, of, their, food, sources, neither, strictly, herbivorous, nor, strictly, carnivorous, mammals, seem, to, have, survived, rather, the, surviving, mammals, and, birds, fed, on, insects, worms, and, snails, which, in, turn, fed, on, detritus, dead, plant, and, animal, matter, in, stream, communities, and, lake, ecosystems, few, animal, groups, became, extinct, including, large, forms, like, crocodyliforms, and, champsosaurs, because, such, communities, rely, less, directly, on, food, from, living, plants, and, more, on, detritus, washed, in, from, the, land, protecting, them, from, extinction, modern, crocodilians, can, live, as, scavengers, and, survive, for, months, without, food, and, their, young, are, small, grow, slowly, and, feed, largely, on, invertebrates, and, dead, organisms, for, their, first, few, years, these, characteristics, have, been, linked, to, crocodilian, survival, at, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, similar, but, more, complex, patterns, have, been, found, in, the, oceans, extinction, was, more, severe, among, animals, living, in, the, water, column, than, among, animals, living, on, or, in, the, sea, floor, animals, in, the, water, column, are, almost, entirely, dependent, on, primary, production, from, living, phytoplankton, while, animals, on, the, ocean, floor, always, or, sometimes, feed, on, detritus, coccolithophorids, and, mollusks, including, ammonites, rudists, freshwater, snails, and, mussels, and, those, organisms, whose, food, chain, included, these, shell, builders, became, extinct, or, suffered, heavy, losses, for, example, it, is, thought, that, ammonites, were, the, principal, food, of, mosasaurs, a, group, of, giant, marine, reptiles, that, became, extinct, at, the, boundary, the, k, pg, extinction, had, a, profound, effect, on, the, evolution, of, life, on, earth, the, elimination, of, dominant, cretaceous, groups, allowed, other, organisms, to, take, their, place, causing, a, remarkable, amount, of, species, diversification, during, the, paleogene, period, after, the, k, pg, extinction, event, biodiversity, required, substantial, time, to, recover, despite, the, existence, of, abundant, vacant, ecological, niches, evidence, from, the, salamanca, formation, suggests, that, biotic, recovery, was, more, rapid, in, the, southern, hemisphere, than, in, the, northern, hemisphere, the, k, pg, boundary, represents, one, of, the, most, dramatic, turnovers, in, the, fossil, record, for, various, calcareous, nanoplankton, that, formed, the, calcium, deposits, for, which, the, cretaceous, is, named, the, turnover, in, this, group, is, clearly, marked, at, the, species, level, statistical, analysis, of, marine, losses, at, this, time, suggests, that, the, decrease, in, diversity, was, caused, more, by, a, sharp, increase, in, extinctions, than, by, a, decrease, in, speciation, major, spatial, differences, existed, in, calcareous, nannoplankton, diversity, patterns, in, the, southern, hemisphere, the, extinction, was, less, severe, and, recovery, occurred, much, faster, than, in, the, northern, hemisphere, following, the, extinction, survivor, communities, dominated, for, several, hundred, thousand, years, the, north, pacific, acted, as, a, diversity, hotspot, from, which, later, nannoplankton, communities, radiated, as, they, replaced, survivor, faunas, across, the, globe, the, k, pg, boundary, record, of, dinoflagellates, is, not, so, well, understood, mainly, because, only, microbial, cysts, provide, a, fossil, record, and, not, all, dinoflagellate, species, have, cyst, forming, stages, which, likely, causes, diversity, to, be, underestimated, recent, studies, indicate, that, there, were, no, major, shifts, in, dinoflagellates, through, the, boundary, layer, there, were, blooms, of, the, taxa, thoracosphaera, operculata, and, braarudosphaera, bigelowii, at, the, boundary, radiolaria, have, left, a, geological, record, since, at, least, the, ordovician, times, and, their, mineral, fossil, skeletons, can, be, tracked, across, the, k, pg, boundary, there, is, no, evidence, of, mass, extinction, of, these, organisms, and, there, is, support, for, high, productivity, of, these, species, in, southern, high, latitudes, as, a, result, of, cooling, temperatures, in, the, early, paleocene, approximately, 46, of, diatom, species, survived, the, transition, from, the, cretaceous, to, the, upper, paleocene, a, significant, turnover, in, species, but, not, a, catastrophic, extinction, the, occurrence, of, planktonic, foraminifera, across, the, k, pg, boundary, has, been, studied, since, the, 1930s, research, spurred, by, the, possibility, of, an, impact, event, at, the, k, pg, boundary, resulted, in, numerous, publications, detailing, planktonic, foraminiferal, extinction, at, the, boundary, there, is, ongoing, debate, between, groups, which, think, the, evidence, indicates, substantial, extinction, of, these, species, at, the, k, pg, boundary, and, those, who, think, the, evidence, supports, a, gradual, extinction, through, the, boundary, there, is, strong, evidence, that, local, conditions, heavily, influenced, diversity, changes, in, planktonic, foraminifera, low, and, mid, latitude, communities, of, planktonic, foraminifera, experienced, high, extinction, rates, while, high, latitude, faunas, were, relatively, unaffected, numerous, species, of, benthic, foraminifera, became, extinct, during, the, event, presumably, because, they, depend, on, organic, debris, for, nutrients, while, biomass, in, the, ocean, is, thought, to, have, decreased, as, the, marine, microbiota, recovered, it, is, thought, that, increased, speciation, of, benthic, foraminifera, resulted, from, the, increase, in, food, sources, in, some, areas, such, as, texas, benthic, foraminifera, show, no, sign, of, any, major, extinction, event, however, phytoplankton, recovery, in, the, early, paleocene, provided, the, food, source, to, support, large, benthic, foraminiferal, assemblages, which, are, mainly, detritus, feeding, ultimate, recovery, of, the, benthic, populations, occurred, over, several, stages, lasting, several, hundred, thousand, years, into, the, early, paleocene, there, is, significant, variation, in, the, fossil, record, as, to, the, extinction, rate, of, marine, invertebrates, across, the, k, pg, boundary, the, apparent, rate, is, influenced, by, a, lack, of, fossil, records, rather, than, extinctions, ostracods, a, class, of, small, crustaceans, that, were, prevalent, in, the, upper, maastrichtian, left, fossil, deposits, in, a, variety, of, locations, a, review, of, these, fossils, shows, that, ostracod, diversity, was, lower, in, the, paleocene, than, any, other, time, in, the, cenozoic, current, research, cannot, ascertain, whether, the, extinctions, occurred, prior, to, or, during, the, boundary, interval, ostracods, that, were, heavily, sexually, selected, were, more, vulnerable, to, extinction, and, ostracod, sexual, dimorphism, was, significantly, rarer, following, the, mass, extinction, among, decapods, extinction, patterns, were, highly, heterogeneous, and, cannot, be, neatly, attributed, to, any, particular, factor, decapods, that, inhabited, the, western, interior, seaway, were, especially, hard, hit, while, other, regions, of, the, world, s, oceans, were, refugia, that, increased, chances, of, survival, into, the, palaeocene, among, retroplumid, crabs, the, genus, costacopluma, was, a, notable, survivor, approximately, 60, of, late, cretaceous, scleractinian, coral, genera, failed, to, cross, the, k, pg, boundary, into, the, paleocene, further, analysis, of, the, coral, extinctions, shows, that, approximately, 98, of, colonial, species, ones, that, inhabit, warm, shallow, tropical, waters, became, extinct, the, solitary, corals, which, generally, do, not, form, reefs, and, inhabit, colder, and, deeper, below, the, photic, zone, areas, of, the, ocean, were, less, impacted, by, the, k, pg, boundary, colonial, coral, species, rely, upon, symbiosis, with, photosynthetic, algae, which, collapsed, due, to, the, events, surrounding, the, k, pg, boundary, but, the, use, of, data, from, coral, fossils, to, support, k, pg, extinction, and, subsequent, paleocene, recovery, must, be, weighed, against, the, changes, that, occurred, in, coral, ecosystems, through, the, k, pg, boundary, most, species, of, brachiopods, a, small, phylum, of, marine, invertebrates, survived, the, k, pg, extinction, event, and, diversified, during, the, early, paleocene, the, numbers, bivalve, genera, exhibited, significant, diminution, after, the, k, pg, boundary, entire, groups, of, bivalves, including, rudists, reef, building, clams, and, inoceramids, giant, relatives, of, modern, scallops, became, extinct, at, the, k, pg, boundary, with, the, gradual, extinction, of, most, inoceramid, bivalves, beginning, well, before, the, k, pg, boundary, deposit, feeders, were, the, most, common, bivalves, in, the, catastrophe, s, aftermath, abundance, was, not, a, factor, that, affected, whether, a, bivalve, taxon, went, extinct, according, to, evidence, from, north, america, veneroid, bivalves, developed, deeper, burrowing, habitats, as, the, recovery, from, the, crisis, ensued, except, for, nautiloids, represented, by, the, modern, order, nautilida, and, coleoids, which, had, already, diverged, into, modern, octopodes, squids, and, cuttlefish, all, other, species, of, the, molluscan, class, cephalopoda, became, extinct, at, the, k, pg, boundary, these, included, the, ecologically, significant, belemnoids, as, well, as, the, ammonoids, a, group, of, highly, diverse, numerous, and, widely, distributed, shelled, cephalopods, the, extinction, of, belemnites, enabled, surviving, cephalopod, clades, to, fill, their, niches, ammonite, genera, became, extinct, at, or, near, the, k, pg, boundary, there, was, a, smaller, and, slower, extinction, of, ammonite, genera, prior, to, the, boundary, associated, with, a, late, cretaceous, marine, regression, and, a, small, gradual, reduction, in, ammonite, diversity, occurred, throughout, the, very, late, cretaceous, researchers, have, pointed, out, that, the, reproductive, strategy, of, the, surviving, nautiloids, which, rely, upon, few, and, larger, eggs, played, a, role, in, outsurviving, their, ammonoid, counterparts, through, the, extinction, event, the, ammonoids, utilized, a, planktonic, strategy, of, reproduction, numerous, eggs, and, planktonic, larvae, which, would, have, been, devastated, by, the, k, pg, extinction, event, additional, research, has, shown, that, subsequent, to, this, elimination, of, ammonoids, from, the, global, biota, nautiloids, began, an, evolutionary, radiation, into, shell, shapes, and, complexities, theretofore, known, only, from, ammonoids, approximately, 35, of, echinoderm, genera, became, extinct, at, the, k, pg, boundary, although, taxa, that, thrived, in, low, latitude, shallow, water, environments, during, the, late, cretaceous, had, the, highest, extinction, rate, mid, latitude, deep, water, echinoderms, were, much, less, affected, at, the, k, pg, boundary, the, pattern, of, extinction, points, to, habitat, loss, specifically, the, drowning, of, carbonate, platforms, the, shallow, water, reefs, in, existence, at, that, time, by, the, extinction, event, atelostomatans, were, affected, by, the, lilliput, effect, insect, damage, to, the, fossilized, leaves, of, flowering, plants, from, fourteen, sites, in, north, america, was, used, as, a, proxy, for, insect, diversity, across, the, k, pg, boundary, and, analyzed, to, determine, the, rate, of, extinction, researchers, found, that, cretaceous, sites, prior, to, the, extinction, event, had, rich, plant, and, insect, feeding, diversity, during, the, early, paleocene, flora, were, relatively, diverse, with, little, predation, from, insects, even, 1, 7, million, years, after, the, extinction, event, studies, of, the, size, of, the, ichnotaxon, naktodemasis, bowni, produced, by, either, cicada, nymphs, or, beetle, larvae, over, the, course, of, the, k, pg, transition, show, that, the, lilliput, effect, occurred, in, terrestrial, invertebrates, thanks, to, the, extinction, event, the, extinction, event, produced, major, changes, in, paleogene, insect, communities, many, groups, of, ants, were, present, in, the, cretaceous, but, in, the, eocene, ants, became, dominant, and, diverse, with, larger, colonies, butterflies, diversified, as, well, perhaps, to, take, the, place, of, leaf, eating, insects, wiped, out, by, the, extinction, the, advanced, mound, building, termites, termitidae, also, appear, to, have, risen, in, importance, there, are, fossil, records, of, jawed, fishes, across, the, k, pg, boundary, which, provide, good, evidence, of, extinction, patterns, of, these, classes, of, marine, vertebrates, while, the, deep, sea, realm, was, able, to, remain, seemingly, unaffected, there, was, an, equal, loss, between, the, open, marine, apex, predators, and, the, durophagous, demersal, feeders, on, the, continental, shelf, within, cartilaginous, fish, approximately, 7, out, of, the, 41, families, of, neoselachians, modern, sharks, skates, and, rays, disappeared, after, this, event, and, batoids, skates, and, rays, lost, nearly, all, the, identifiable, species, while, more, than, 90, of, teleost, fish, bony, fish, families, survived, in, the, maastrichtian, age, 28, shark, families, and, 13, batoid, families, thrived, of, which, 25, and, 9, respectively, survived, the, k, t, boundary, event, forty, seven, of, all, neoselachian, genera, cross, the, k, t, boundary, with, 85, being, sharks, batoids, display, with, 15, a, comparably, low, survival, rate, among, elasmobranchs, those, species, that, inhabited, higher, latitudes, and, lived, pelagic, lifestyles, were, more, likely, to, survive, whereas, epibenthic, lifestyles, and, durophagy, were, strongly, associated, with, the, likelihood, of, perishing, during, the, extinction, event, there, is, evidence, of, a, mass, extinction, of, bony, fishes, at, a, fossil, site, immediately, above, the, k, pg, boundary, layer, on, seymour, island, near, antarctica, apparently, precipitated, by, the, k, pg, extinction, event, the, marine, and, freshwater, environments, of, fishes, mitigated, the, environmental, effects, of, the, extinction, event, the, result, was, patterson, s, gap, a, period, in, the, earliest, part, of, the, cenozoic, of, decreased, acanthomorph, diversity, although, acanthomorphs, diversified, rapidly, after, the, extinction, teleost, fish, diversified, explosively, after, the, mass, extinction, filling, the, niches, left, vacant, by, the, extinction, groups, appearing, in, the, paleocene, and, eocene, epochs, include, billfish, tunas, eels, and, flatfish, there, is, limited, evidence, for, extinction, of, amphibians, at, the, k, pg, boundary, a, study, of, fossil, vertebrates, across, the, k, pg, boundary, in, montana, concluded, that, no, species, of, amphibian, became, extinct, yet, there, are, several, species, of, maastrichtian, amphibian, not, included, as, part, of, this, study, which, are, unknown, from, the, paleocene, these, include, the, frog, theatonius, lancensis, and, the, albanerpetontid, albanerpeton, galaktion, therefore, some, amphibians, do, seem, to, have, become, extinct, at, the, boundary, the, relatively, low, levels, of, extinction, seen, among, amphibians, probably, reflect, the, low, extinction, rates, seen, in, freshwater, animals, following, the, mass, extinction, frogs, radiated, substantially, with, 88, of, modern, anuran, diversity, being, traced, back, to, three, lineages, of, frogs, that, evolved, after, the, cataclysm, the, choristoderes, a, group, of, semi, aquatic, diapsids, of, uncertain, position, survived, across, the, k, pg, boundary, subsequently, becoming, extinct, in, the, miocene, the, gharial, like, choristodere, genus, champsosaurus, palatal, teeth, suggest, that, there, were, dietary, changes, among, the, various, species, across, the, k, pg, event, more, than, 80, of, cretaceous, turtle, species, passed, through, the, k, pg, boundary, all, six, turtle, families, in, existence, at, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, survived, into, the, paleogene, and, are, represented, by, living, species, analysis, of, turtle, survivorship, in, the, hell, creek, formation, shows, a, minimum, of, 75, of, turtle, species, survived, following, the, extinction, event, turtle, diversity, exceeded, pre, extinction, levels, in, the, danian, of, north, america, although, in, south, america, it, remained, diminished, european, turtles, likewise, recovered, rapidly, following, the, mass, extinction, the, rhynchocephalians, which, were, a, globally, distributed, and, diverse, group, of, lepidosaurians, during, the, early, mesozoic, had, begun, to, decline, by, the, mid, cretaceous, although, they, remained, successful, in, the, late, cretaceous, of, southern, south, america, they, are, represented, today, by, a, single, species, the, tuatara, sphenodon, punctatus, found, in, new, zealand, outside, of, new, zealand, one, rhynchocephalian, is, known, to, have, crossed, the, k, pg, boundary, kawasphenodon, peligrensis, known, from, the, earliest, paleocene, danian, of, patagonia, the, order, squamata, comprising, lizards, and, snakes, first, diversified, during, the, jurassic, and, continued, to, diversify, throughout, the, cretaceous, they, are, currently, the, most, successful, and, diverse, group, of, living, reptiles, with, more, than, 10, 000, extant, species, the, only, major, group, of, terrestrial, lizards, to, go, extinct, at, the, end, of, the, creteaceous, were, the, polyglyphanodontians, a, diverse, group, of, mainly, herbivorous, lizards, known, predominantly, from, the, northern, hemisphere, the, mosasaurs, a, diverse, group, of, large, predatory, marine, reptiles, also, became, extinct, fossil, evidence, indicates, that, squamates, generally, suffered, very, heavy, losses, in, the, k, pg, event, only, recovering, 10, million, years, after, it, the, extinction, of, cretaceous, lizards, and, snakes, may, have, led, to, the, evolution, of, modern, groups, such, as, iguanas, monitor, lizards, and, boas, the, diversification, of, crown, group, snakes, has, been, linked, to, the, biotic, recovery, in, the, aftermath, of, the, k, pg, extinction, event, pan, gekkotans, weathered, the, extinction, event, well, with, multiple, lineages, likely, surviving, 44, 42, ca, values, indicate, that, prior, to, the, mass, extinction, marine, reptiles, at, the, top, of, food, webs, were, feeding, on, only, one, source, of, calcium, suggesting, their, populations, exhibited, heightened, vulnerability, to, extinctions, at, the, terminus, of, the, cretaceous, along, with, the, aforementioned, mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, represented, by, the, families, elasmosauridae, and, polycotylidae, became, extinct, during, the, event, the, ichthyosaurs, had, disappeared, from, fossil, record, tens, of, millions, of, years, prior, to, the, k, pg, extinction, event, ten, families, of, crocodilians, or, their, close, relatives, are, represented, in, the, maastrichtian, fossil, records, of, which, five, died, out, prior, to, the, k, pg, boundary, five, families, have, both, maastrichtian, and, paleocene, fossil, representatives, all, of, the, surviving, families, of, crocodyliforms, inhabited, freshwater, and, terrestrial, environments, except, for, the, dyrosauridae, which, lived, in, freshwater, and, marine, locations, approximately, 50, of, crocodyliform, representatives, survived, across, the, k, pg, boundary, the, only, apparent, trend, being, that, no, large, crocodiles, survived, crocodyliform, survivability, across, the, boundary, may, have, resulted, from, their, aquatic, niche, and, ability, to, burrow, which, reduced, susceptibility, to, negative, environmental, effects, at, the, boundary, jouve, and, colleagues, suggested, in, 2008, that, juvenile, marine, crocodyliforms, lived, in, freshwater, environments, as, do, modern, marine, crocodile, juveniles, which, would, have, helped, them, survive, where, other, marine, reptiles, became, extinct, freshwater, environments, were, not, so, strongly, affected, by, the, k, pg, extinction, event, as, marine, environments, were, among, the, terrestrial, clade, notosuchia, only, the, family, sebecidae, survived, the, exact, reasons, for, this, pattern, are, not, known, sebecids, were, large, terrestrial, predators, are, known, from, the, eocene, of, europe, and, would, survive, in, south, america, into, the, miocene, tethysuchians, radiated, explosively, after, the, extinction, event, two, families, of, pterosaurs, azhdarchidae, and, nyctosauridae, were, definitely, present, in, the, maastrichtian, and, they, likely, became, extinct, at, the, k, pg, boundary, several, other, pterosaur, lineages, may, have, been, present, during, the, maastrichtian, such, as, the, ornithocheirids, pteranodontids, a, possible, tapejarid, a, possible, thalassodromid, and, a, basal, toothed, taxon, of, uncertain, affinities, though, they, are, represented, by, fragmentary, remains, that, are, difficult, to, assign, to, any, given, group, while, this, was, occurring, modern, birds, were, undergoing, diversification, traditionally, it, was, thought, that, they, replaced, archaic, birds, and, pterosaur, groups, possibly, due, to, direct, competition, or, they, simply, filled, empty, niches, but, there, is, no, correlation, between, pterosaur, and, avian, diversities, that, are, conclusive, to, a, competition, hypothesis, and, small, pterosaurs, were, present, in, the, late, cretaceous, at, least, some, niches, previously, held, by, birds, were, reclaimed, by, pterosaurs, prior, to, the, k, pg, event, scientists, agree, that, all, non, avian, dinosaurs, became, extinct, at, the, k, pg, boundary, the, dinosaur, fossil, record, has, been, interpreted, to, show, both, a, decline, in, diversity, and, no, decline, in, diversity, during, the, last, few, million, years, of, the, cretaceous, and, it, may, be, that, the, quality, of, the, dinosaur, fossil, record, is, simply, not, good, enough, to, permit, researchers, to, distinguish, between, the, options, there, is, no, evidence, that, late, maastrichtian, non, avian, dinosaurs, could, burrow, swim, or, dive, which, suggests, they, were, unable, to, shelter, themselves, from, the, worst, parts, of, any, environmental, stress, that, occurred, at, the, k, pg, boundary, it, is, possible, that, small, dinosaurs, other, than, birds, did, survive, but, they, would, have, been, deprived, of, food, as, herbivorous, dinosaurs, would, have, found, plant, material, scarce, and, carnivores, would, have, quickly, found, prey, in, short, supply, the, growing, consensus, about, the, endothermy, of, dinosaurs, see, dinosaur, physiology, helps, to, understand, their, full, extinction, in, contrast, with, their, close, relatives, the, crocodilians, ectothermic, cold, blooded, crocodiles, have, very, limited, needs, for, food, they, can, survive, several, months, without, eating, while, endothermic, warm, blooded, animals, of, similar, size, need, much, more, food, to, sustain, their, faster, metabolism, thus, under, the, circumstances, of, food, chain, disruption, previously, mentioned, non, avian, dinosaurs, died, out, while, some, crocodiles, survived, in, this, context, the, survival, of, other, endothermic, animals, such, as, some, birds, and, mammals, could, be, due, among, other, reasons, to, their, smaller, needs, for, food, related, to, their, small, size, at, the, extinction, epoch, prolonged, cold, is, unlikely, to, have, been, a, reason, for, the, extinction, of, non, avian, dinosaurs, given, the, adaptations, of, many, dinosaurs, to, cold, environments, whether, the, extinction, occurred, gradually, or, suddenly, has, been, debated, as, both, views, have, support, from, the, fossil, record, a, highly, informative, sequence, of, dinosaur, bearing, rocks, from, the, k, pg, boundary, is, found, in, western, north, america, particularly, the, late, maastrichtian, age, hell, creek, formation, of, montana, comparison, with, the, older, judith, river, formation, montana, and, dinosaur, park, formation, alberta, which, both, date, from, approximately, 75, ma, provides, information, on, the, changes, in, dinosaur, populations, over, the, last, 10, million, years, of, the, cretaceous, these, fossil, beds, are, geographically, limited, covering, only, part, of, one, continent, the, middle, late, campanian, formations, show, a, greater, diversity, of, dinosaurs, than, any, other, single, group, of, rocks, the, late, maastrichtian, rocks, contain, the, largest, members, of, several, major, clades, tyrannosaurus, ankylosaurus, pachycephalosaurus, triceratops, and, torosaurus, which, suggests, food, was, plentiful, immediately, prior, to, the, extinction, a, study, of, 29, fossil, sites, in, catalan, pyrenees, of, europe, in, 2010, supports, the, view, that, dinosaurs, there, had, great, diversity, until, the, asteroid, impact, with, more, than, 100, living, species, more, recent, research, indicates, that, this, figure, is, obscured, by, taphonomic, biases, and, the, sparsity, of, the, continental, fossil, record, the, results, of, this, study, which, were, based, on, estimated, real, global, biodiversity, showed, that, between, 628, and, 1, 078, non, avian, dinosaur, species, were, alive, at, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, and, underwent, sudden, extinction, after, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, alternatively, interpretation, based, on, the, fossil, bearing, rocks, along, the, red, deer, river, in, alberta, canada, supports, the, gradual, extinction, of, non, avian, dinosaurs, during, the, last, 10, million, years, of, the, cretaceous, layers, there, the, number, of, dinosaur, species, seems, to, have, decreased, from, about, 45, to, approximately, 12, other, scientists, have, made, the, same, assessment, following, their, research, several, researchers, support, the, existence, of, paleocene, non, avian, dinosaurs, evidence, of, this, existence, is, based, on, the, discovery, of, dinosaur, remains, in, the, hell, creek, formation, up, to, 1, 3, m, 4, ft, 3, 2, in, above, and, 40, 000, years, later, than, the, k, pg, boundary, pollen, samples, recovered, near, a, fossilized, hadrosaur, femur, recovered, in, the, ojo, alamo, sandstone, at, the, san, juan, river, in, colorado, indicate, that, the, animal, lived, during, the, cenozoic, approximately, 64, 5, ma, about, 1, million, years, after, the, k, pg, extinction, event, if, their, existence, past, the, k, pg, boundary, can, be, confirmed, these, hadrosaurids, would, be, considered, a, dead, clade, walking, the, scientific, consensus, is, that, these, fossils, were, eroded, from, their, original, locations, and, then, re, buried, in, much, later, sediments, also, known, as, reworked, fossils, most, paleontologists, regard, birds, as, the, only, surviving, dinosaurs, see, origin, of, birds, it, is, thought, that, all, non, avian, theropods, became, extinct, including, then, flourishing, groups, such, as, enantiornithines, and, hesperornithiforms, several, analyses, of, bird, fossils, show, divergence, of, species, prior, to, the, k, pg, boundary, and, that, duck, chicken, and, ratite, bird, relatives, coexisted, with, non, avian, dinosaurs, large, collections, of, bird, fossils, representing, a, range, of, different, species, provide, definitive, evidence, for, the, persistence, of, archaic, birds, to, within, 300, 000, years, of, the, k, pg, boundary, the, absence, of, these, birds, in, the, paleogene, is, evidence, that, a, mass, extinction, of, archaic, birds, took, place, there, the, most, successful, and, dominant, group, of, avialans, enantiornithes, were, wiped, out, only, a, small, fraction, of, ground, and, water, dwelling, cretaceous, bird, species, survived, the, impact, giving, rise, to, today, s, birds, the, only, bird, group, known, for, certain, to, have, survived, the, k, pg, boundary, is, the, aves, avians, may, have, been, able, to, survive, the, extinction, as, a, result, of, their, abilities, to, dive, swim, or, seek, shelter, in, water, and, marshlands, many, species, of, avians, can, build, burrows, or, nest, in, tree, holes, or, termite, nests, all, of, which, provided, shelter, from, the, environmental, effects, at, the, k, pg, boundary, long, term, survival, past, the, boundary, was, assured, as, a, result, of, filling, ecological, niches, left, empty, by, extinction, of, non, avian, dinosaurs, based, on, molecular, sequencing, and, fossil, dating, many, species, of, birds, the, neoaves, group, in, particular, appeared, to, radiate, after, the, k, pg, boundary, the, open, niche, space, and, relative, scarcity, of, predators, following, the, k, pg, extinction, allowed, for, adaptive, radiation, of, various, avian, groups, ratites, for, example, rapidly, diversified, in, the, early, paleogene, and, are, believed, to, have, convergently, developed, flightlessness, at, least, three, to, six, times, often, fulfilling, the, niche, space, for, large, herbivores, once, occupied, by, non, avian, dinosaurs, mammalian, species, began, diversifying, approximately, 30, million, years, prior, to, the, k, pg, boundary, diversification, of, mammals, stalled, across, the, boundary, all, major, late, cretaceous, mammalian, lineages, including, monotremes, egg, laying, mammals, multituberculates, metatherians, which, includes, modern, marsupials, eutherians, which, includes, modern, placentals, meridiolestidans, and, gondwanatheres, survived, the, k, pg, extinction, event, although, they, suffered, losses, in, particular, metatherians, largely, disappeared, from, north, america, and, the, asian, deltatheroidans, became, extinct, aside, from, the, lineage, leading, to, gurbanodelta, in, the, hell, creek, beds, of, north, america, at, least, half, of, the, ten, known, multituberculate, species, and, all, eleven, metatherians, species, are, not, found, above, the, boundary, multituberculates, in, europe, and, north, america, survived, relatively, unscathed, and, quickly, bounced, back, in, the, paleocene, but, asian, forms, were, devastated, never, again, to, represent, a, significant, component, of, mammalian, fauna, a, recent, study, indicates, that, metatherians, suffered, the, heaviest, losses, at, the, k, pg, event, followed, by, multituberculates, while, eutherians, recovered, the, quickest, k, pg, boundary, mammalian, species, were, generally, small, comparable, in, size, to, rats, this, small, size, would, have, helped, them, find, shelter, in, protected, environments, it, is, postulated, that, some, early, monotremes, marsupials, and, placentals, were, semiaquatic, or, burrowing, as, there, are, multiple, mammalian, lineages, with, such, habits, today, any, burrowing, or, semiaquatic, mammal, would, have, had, additional, protection, from, k, pg, boundary, environmental, stresses, after, the, k, pg, extinction, mammals, evolved, to, fill, the, niches, left, vacant, by, the, dinosaurs, some, research, indicates, that, mammals, did, not, explosively, diversify, across, the, k, pg, boundary, despite, the, ecological, niches, made, available, by, the, extinction, of, dinosaurs, several, mammalian, orders, have, been, interpreted, as, diversifying, immediately, after, the, k, pg, boundary, including, chiroptera, bats, and, cetartiodactyla, a, diverse, group, that, today, includes, whales, and, dolphins, and, even, toed, ungulates, although, recent, research, concludes, that, only, marsupial, orders, diversified, soon, after, the, k, pg, boundary, however, morphological, diversification, rates, among, eutherians, after, the, extinction, event, were, thrice, those, of, before, it, also, significant, within, the, mammalian, genera, new, species, were, approximately, 9, 1, larger, after, the, k, pg, boundary, after, about, 700, 000, years, some, mammals, had, reached, 50, kilos, 110, pounds, a, 100, fold, increase, over, the, weight, of, those, which, survived, the, extinction, it, is, thought, that, body, sizes, of, placental, mammalian, survivors, evolutionarily, increased, first, allowing, them, to, fill, niches, after, the, extinctions, with, brain, sizes, increasing, later, in, the, eocene, plant, fossils, illustrate, the, reduction, in, plant, species, across, the, k, pg, boundary, there, is, overwhelming, evidence, of, global, disruption, of, plant, communities, at, the, k, pg, boundary, extinctions, are, seen, both, in, studies, of, fossil, pollen, and, fossil, leaves, in, north, america, the, data, suggests, massive, devastation, and, mass, extinction, of, plants, at, the, k, pg, boundary, sections, although, there, were, substantial, megafloral, changes, before, the, boundary, in, north, america, approximately, 57, of, plant, species, became, extinct, in, high, southern, hemisphere, latitudes, such, as, new, zealand, and, antarctica, the, mass, die, off, of, flora, caused, no, significant, turnover, in, species, but, dramatic, and, short, term, changes, in, the, relative, abundance, of, plant, groups, european, flora, was, also, less, affected, most, likely, due, to, its, distance, from, the, site, of, the, chicxulub, impact, in, northern, alaska, and, the, anadyr, koryak, region, of, russia, the, flora, was, minimally, impacted, another, line, of, evidence, of, a, major, floral, extinction, is, that, the, divergence, rate, of, subviral, pathogens, of, angiosperms, sharply, decreased, which, indicates, an, enormous, reduction, in, the, number, of, flowering, plants, however, phylogenetic, evidence, shows, no, mass, angiosperm, extinction, due, to, the, wholesale, destruction, of, plants, at, the, k, pg, boundary, there, was, a, proliferation, of, saprotrophic, organisms, such, as, fungi, that, do, not, require, photosynthesis, and, use, nutrients, from, decaying, vegetation, the, dominance, of, fungal, species, lasted, only, a, few, years, while, the, atmosphere, cleared, and, plenty, of, organic, matter, to, feed, on, was, present, once, the, atmosphere, cleared, photosynthetic, organisms, returned, initially, ferns, and, other, ground, level, plants, in, some, regions, the, paleocene, recovery, of, plants, began, with, recolonizations, by, fern, species, represented, as, a, fern, spike, in, the, geologic, record, this, same, pattern, of, fern, recolonization, was, observed, after, the, 1980, mount, st, helens, eruption, just, two, species, of, fern, appear, to, have, dominated, the, landscape, for, centuries, after, the, event, in, the, sediments, below, the, k, pg, boundary, the, dominant, plant, remains, are, angiosperm, pollen, grains, but, the, boundary, layer, contains, little, pollen, and, is, dominated, by, fern, spores, more, usual, pollen, levels, gradually, resume, above, the, boundary, layer, this, is, reminiscent, of, areas, blighted, by, modern, volcanic, eruptions, where, the, recovery, is, led, by, ferns, which, are, later, replaced, by, larger, angiosperm, plants, in, north, american, terrestrial, sequences, the, extinction, event, is, best, represented, by, the, marked, discrepancy, between, the, rich, and, relatively, abundant, late, maastrichtian, pollen, record, and, the, post, boundary, fern, spike, polyploidy, appears, to, have, enhanced, the, ability, of, flowering, plants, to, survive, the, extinction, probably, because, the, additional, copies, of, the, genome, such, plants, possessed, allowed, them, to, more, readily, adapt, to, the, rapidly, changing, environmental, conditions, that, followed, the, impact, beyond, extinction, impacts, the, event, also, caused, more, general, changes, of, flora, such, as, giving, rise, to, neotropical, rainforest, biomes, like, the, amazonia, replacing, species, composition, and, structure, of, local, forests, during, 6, million, years, of, recovery, to, former, levels, of, plant, diversity, while, it, appears, that, many, fungi, were, wiped, out, at, the, k, pg, boundary, there, is, some, evidence, that, some, fungal, species, thrived, in, the, years, after, the, extinction, event, microfossils, from, that, period, indicate, a, great, increase, in, fungal, spores, long, before, the, resumption, of, plentiful, fern, spores, in, the, recovery, after, the, impact, monoporisporites, and, hypha, are, almost, exclusive, microfossils, for, a, short, span, during, and, after, the, iridium, boundary, these, saprophytes, would, not, need, sunlight, allowing, them, to, survive, during, a, period, when, the, atmosphere, was, likely, clogged, with, dust, and, sulfur, aerosols, the, proliferation, of, fungi, has, occurred, after, several, extinction, events, including, the, permian, triassic, extinction, event, the, largest, known, mass, extinction, in, earth, s, history, with, up, to, 96, of, all, species, suffering, extinction, a, 1991, study, of, fossil, leaves, dated, the, extinction, associated, freezing, to, early, june, a, later, study, shifted, the, dating, to, spring, season, based, on, the, osteological, evidence, and, stable, isotope, records, of, well, preserved, bones, of, acipenseriform, fishes, the, study, noted, that, the, palaeobotanical, identities, taphonomic, inferences, and, stratigraphic, assumptions, for, the, june, dating, have, since, all, been, refuted, another, modern, study, opted, for, the, spring, summer, range, a, study, of, fossilized, fish, bones, found, at, tanis, in, north, dakota, suggests, that, the, cretaceous, paleogene, mass, extinction, happened, during, the, northern, hemisphere, spring, the, rapidity, of, the, extinction, is, a, controversial, issue, because, some, theories, about, its, causes, imply, a, rapid, extinction, over, a, relatively, short, period, from, a, few, years, to, a, few, thousand, years, while, others, imply, longer, periods, the, issue, is, difficult, to, resolve, because, of, the, signor, lipps, effect, where, the, fossil, record, is, so, incomplete, that, most, extinct, species, probably, died, out, long, after, the, most, recent, fossil, that, has, been, found, scientists, have, also, found, very, few, continuous, beds, of, fossil, bearing, rock, that, cover, a, time, range, from, several, million, years, before, the, k, pg, extinction, to, several, million, years, after, it, the, sedimentation, rate, and, thickness, of, k, pg, clay, from, three, sites, suggest, rapid, extinction, perhaps, over, a, period, of, less, than, 10, 000, years, at, one, site, in, the, denver, basin, of, colorado, after, the, k, pg, boundary, layer, was, deposited, the, fern, spike, lasted, approximately, 1, 000, years, and, no, more, than, 71, 000, years, at, the, same, location, the, earliest, appearance, of, cenozoic, mammals, occurred, after, approximately, 185, 000, years, and, no, more, than, 570, 000, years, indicating, rapid, rates, of, biotic, extinction, and, initial, recovery, in, the, denver, basin, during, this, event, analysis, of, the, carbon, cycle, disruptions, caused, by, the, impact, constrains, them, to, an, interval, of, just, 5, 000, years, models, presented, at, the, annual, meeting, of, the, american, geophysical, union, demonstrated, that, the, period, of, global, darkness, following, the, chicxulub, impact, would, have, persisted, in, the, hell, creek, formation, nearly, 2, years, in, 1980, a, team, of, researchers, consisting, of, nobel, prize, winning, physicist, luis, alvarez, his, son, geologist, walter, alvarez, and, chemists, frank, asaro, and, helen, michel, discovered, that, sedimentary, layers, found, all, over, the, world, at, the, cretaceous, paleogene, boundary, contain, a, concentration, of, iridium, many, times, greater, than, normal, 30, 160, and, 20, times, in, three, sections, originally, studied, iridium, is, extremely, rare, in, earth, s, crust, because, it, is, a, siderophile, element, which, mostly, sank, along, with, iron, into, earth, s, core, during, planetary, differentiation, instead, iridium, is, more, common, in, comets, and, asteroids, because, of, this, the, alvarez, team, suggested, that, an, asteroid, struck, the, earth, at, the, time, of, the, k, pg, boundary, there, were, earlier, speculations, on, the, possibility, of, an, impact, event, but, this, was, the, first, hard, evidence, and, since, then, studies, have, continued, to, demonstrate, elevated, iridium, levels, in, association, with, the, k, pg, boundary, this, hypothesis, was, viewed, as, radical, when, first, proposed, but, additional, evidence, soon, emerged, the, boundary, clay, was, found, to, be, full, of, minute, spherules, of, rock, crystallized, from, droplets, of, molten, rock, formed, by, the, impact, shocked, quartz, and, other, minerals, were, also, identified, in, the, k, pg, boundary, the, identification, of, giant, tsunami, beds, along, the, gulf, coast, and, the, caribbean, provided, more, evidence, and, suggested, that, the, impact, might, have, occurred, nearby, as, did, the, discovery, that, the, k, pg, boundary, became, thicker, in, the, southern, united, states, with, meter, thick, beds, of, debris, occurring, in, northern, new, mexico, a, k, pg, boundary, cocktail, of, microfossils, lithic, fragments, and, impact, derived, material, deposited, by, gigantic, sediment, gravity, flows, was, discovered, in, the, caribbean, that, served, to, demarcate, the, impact, further, research, identified, the, giant, chicxulub, crater, buried, under, chicxulub, on, the, coast, of, yucat, n, as, the, source, of, the, k, pg, boundary, clay, identified, in, 1990, based, on, work, by, geophysicist, glen, penfield, in, 1978, the, crater, is, oval, with, an, average, diameter, of, roughly, 180, km, 110, mi, about, the, size, calculated, by, the, alvarez, team, in, march, 2010, an, international, panel, of, 41, scientists, reviewed, 20, years, of, scientific, literature, and, endorsed, the, asteroid, hypothesis, specifically, the, chicxulub, impact, as, the, cause, of, the, extinction, ruling, out, other, theories, such, as, massive, volcanism, they, had, determined, that, a, 10, to, 15, kilometer, 6, to, 9, mi, asteroid, hurtled, into, earth, at, chicxulub, on, mexico, s, yucat, n, peninsula, additional, evidence, for, the, impact, event, is, found, at, the, tanis, site, in, southwestern, north, dakota, united, states, tanis, is, part, of, the, heavily, studied, hell, creek, formation, a, group, of, rocks, spanning, four, states, in, north, america, renowned, for, many, significant, fossil, discoveries, from, the, upper, cretaceous, and, lower, paleocene, tanis, is, an, extraordinary, and, unique, site, because, it, appears, to, record, the, events, from, the, first, minutes, until, a, few, hours, after, the, impact, of, the, giant, chicxulub, asteroid, in, extreme, detail, amber, from, the, site, has, been, reported, to, contain, microtektites, matching, those, of, the, chicxulub, impact, event, some, researchers, question, the, interpretation, of, the, findings, at, the, site, or, are, skeptical, of, the, team, leader, robert, depalma, who, had, not, yet, received, his, ph, d, in, geology, at, the, time, of, the, discovery, and, whose, commercial, activities, have, been, regarded, with, suspicion, furthermore, indirect, evidence, of, an, asteroid, impact, as, the, cause, of, the, mass, extinction, comes, from, patterns, of, turnover, in, marine, plankton, some, critics, of, the, impact, theory, have, put, forward, that, the, impact, precedes, the, mass, extinction, by, about, 300, 000, years, and, thus, was, not, its, cause, however, in, a, 2013, paper, paul, renne, of, the, berkeley, geochronology, center, dated, the, impact, at, 66, 043, 0, 011, million, years, ago, based, on, argon, argon, dating, he, further, posits, that, the, mass, extinction, occurred, within, 32, 000, years, of, this, date, the, dating, of, hydrothermally, altered, structures, around, the, crater, is, consistent, with, this, timeline, in, 2007, it, was, proposed, that, the, impactor, belonged, to, the, baptistina, family, of, asteroids, this, link, has, been, doubted, though, not, disproved, in, part, because, of, a, lack, of, observations, of, the, asteroid, and, its, family, it, was, reported, in, 2009, that, 298, baptistina, does, not, share, the, chemical, signature, of, the, k, pg, impactor, further, a, 2011, wide, field, infrared, survey, explorer, wise, study, of, reflected, light, from, the, asteroids, of, the, family, estimated, their, break, up, at, 80, ma, giving, them, insufficient, time, to, shift, orbits, and, impact, earth, by, 66, ma, the, collision, would, have, released, the, same, energy, as, 100, teratonnes, of, tnt, 4, 2, 10, 23, joules, more, than, a, billion, times, the, energy, of, the, atomic, bombings, of, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, the, chicxulub, impact, caused, a, global, catastrophe, some, of, the, phenomena, were, brief, occurrences, immediately, following, the, impact, but, there, were, also, long, term, geochemical, and, climatic, disruptions, that, devastated, the, ecology, the, scientific, consensus, is, that, the, asteroid, impact, at, the, k, pg, boundary, left, megatsunami, deposits, and, sediments, around, the, area, of, the, caribbean, sea, and, gulf, of, mexico, from, the, colossal, waves, created, by, the, impact, these, deposits, have, been, identified, in, the, la, popa, basin, in, northeastern, mexico, platform, carbonates, in, northeastern, brazil, in, atlantic, deep, sea, sediments, and, in, the, form, of, the, thickest, known, layer, of, graded, sand, deposits, around, 100, m, 330, ft, in, the, chicxulub, crater, itself, directly, above, the, shocked, granite, ejecta, the, megatsunami, has, been, estimated, at, more, than, 100, m, 330, ft, tall, as, the, asteroid, fell, into, relatively, shallow, seas, in, deep, seas, it, would, have, been, 4, 6, km, 2, 9, mi, tall, fossiliferous, sedimentary, rocks, deposited, during, the, k, pg, impact, have, been, found, in, the, gulf, of, mexico, area, including, tsunami, wash, deposits, carrying, remains, of, a, mangrove, type, ecosystem, indicating, that, water, in, the, gulf, of, mexico, sloshed, back, and, forth, repeatedly, after, the, impact, dead, fish, left, in, these, shallow, waters, were, not, disturbed, by, scavengers, the, re, entry, of, ejecta, into, earth, s, atmosphere, included, a, brief, hours, long, but, intense, pulse, of, infrared, radiation, cooking, exposed, organisms, this, is, debated, with, opponents, arguing, that, local, ferocious, fires, probably, limited, to, north, america, fall, short, of, global, firestorms, this, is, the, cretaceous, paleogene, firestorm, debate, a, paper, in, 2013, by, a, prominent, modeler, of, nuclear, winter, suggested, that, based, on, the, amount, of, soot, in, the, global, debris, layer, the, entire, terrestrial, biosphere, might, have, burned, implying, a, global, soot, cloud, blocking, out, the, sun, and, creating, an, impact, winter, effect, if, widespread, fires, occurred, this, would, have, exterminated, the, most, vulnerable, organisms, that, survived, the, period, immediately, after, the, impact, experimental, analysis, suggests, that, any, impact, induced, wildfires, were, insufficient, on, their, own, to, cause, plant, extinctions, and, much, of, the, thermal, radiation, generated, by, the, impact, would, have, been, absorbed, by, the, atmosphere, and, ejecta, in, the, lower, atmosphere, aside, from, the, hypothesized, fire, effects, on, reduction, of, insolation, the, impact, would, have, created, a, humongous, dust, cloud, that, blocked, sunlight, for, up, to, a, year, inhibiting, photosynthesis, the, asteroid, hit, an, area, of, gypsum, and, anhydrite, rock, containing, a, large, amount, of, combustible, hydrocarbons, and, sulfur, much, of, which, was, vaporized, thereby, injecting, sulfuric, acid, aerosols, into, the, stratosphere, which, might, have, reduced, sunlight, reaching, the, earth, s, surface, by, more, than, 50, fine, silicate, dust, also, contributed, to, the, intense, impact, winter, as, did, soot, from, wildfires, the, climatic, forcing, of, this, impact, winter, was, about, 100, times, more, potent, than, that, of, the, 1991, eruption, of, mount, pinatubo, according, to, models, of, the, hell, creek, formation, the, onset, of, global, darkness, would, have, reached, its, maximum, in, only, a, few, weeks, and, likely, lasted, upwards, of, 2, years, freezing, temperatures, probably, lasted, for, at, least, three, years, at, brazos, section, the, sea, surface, temperature, dropped, as, much, as, 7, c, 13, f, for, decades, after, the, impact, it, would, take, at, least, ten, years, for, such, aerosols, to, dissipate, and, would, account, for, the, extinction, of, plants, and, phytoplankton, and, subsequently, herbivores, and, their, predators, creatures, whose, food, chains, were, based, on, detritus, would, have, a, reasonable, chance, of, survival, in, 2016, a, scientific, drilling, project, obtained, deep, rock, core, samples, from, the, peak, ring, around, the, chicxulub, impact, crater, the, discoveries, confirmed, that, the, rock, comprising, the, peak, ring, had, been, shocked, by, immense, pressure, and, melted, in, just, minutes, from, its, usual, state, into, its, present, form, unlike, sea, floor, deposits, the, peak, ring, was, made, of, granite, originating, much, deeper, in, the, earth, which, had, been, ejected, to, the, surface, by, the, impact, gypsum, is, a, sulfate, containing, rock, usually, present, in, the, shallow, seabed, of, the, region, it, had, been, almost, entirely, removed, vaporized, into, the, atmosphere, the, impactor, was, large, enough, to, create, a, 190, kilometer, wide, 120, mi, peak, ring, to, melt, shock, and, eject, deep, granite, to, create, colossal, water, movements, and, to, eject, an, immense, quantity, of, vaporized, rock, and, sulfates, into, the, atmosphere, where, they, would, have, persisted, for, several, years, this, worldwide, dispersal, of, dust, and, sulfates, would, have, affected, climate, catastrophically, led, to, large, temperature, drops, and, devastated, the, food, chain, the, release, of, large, quantities, of, sulphur, aerosols, into, the, atmosphere, as, a, consequence, of, the, impact, would, also, have, caused, acid, rain, oceans, acidified, as, a, result, this, decrease, in, ocean, ph, would, kill, many, organisms, that, grow, shells, of, calcium, carbonate, the, heating, of, the, atmosphere, during, the, impact, itself, may, have, also, generated, nitric, acid, rain, through, the, production, of, nitrogen, oxides, and, their, subsequent, reaction, with, water, vapour, after, the, impact, winter, the, earth, entered, a, period, of, global, warming, as, a, result, of, the, vapourisation, of, carbonates, into, carbon, dioxide, whose, long, residence, time, in, the, atmosphere, ensured, significant, warming, would, occur, after, more, short, lived, cooling, gases, dissipated, carbon, monoxide, concentrations, also, increased, and, caused, particularly, devastating, global, warming, because, of, the, consequent, increases, in, tropospheric, ozone, and, methane, concentrations, the, impact, s, injection, of, water, vapour, into, the, atmosphere, also, produced, major, climatic, perturbations, the, end, cretaceous, event, is, the, only, mass, extinction, definitively, known, to, be, associated, with, an, impact, and, other, large, extraterrestrial, impacts, such, as, the, manicouagan, reservoir, impact, do, not, coincide, with, any, noticeable, extinction, events, other, crater, like, topographic, features, have, also, been, proposed, as, impact, craters, formed, in, connection, with, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, this, suggests, the, possibility, of, near, simultaneous, multiple, impacts, perhaps, from, a, fragmented, asteroidal, object, similar, to, the, shoemaker, levy, 9, impact, with, jupiter, in, addition, to, the, 180, km, 110, mi, chicxulub, crater, there, is, the, 24, km, 15, mi, boltysh, crater, in, ukraine, 65, 17, 0, 64, ma, the, 20, km, 12, mi, silverpit, crater, in, the, north, sea, 59, 5, 14, 5, ma, possibly, formed, by, bolide, impact, and, the, controversial, and, much, larger, 600, km, 370, mi, shiva, crater, any, other, craters, that, might, have, formed, in, the, tethys, ocean, would, since, have, been, obscured, by, the, northward, tectonic, drift, of, africa, and, india, the, deccan, traps, which, erupted, close, to, the, boundary, between, the, mesozoic, and, cenozoic, have, been, cited, as, an, alternate, explanation, for, the, mass, extinction, before, 2000, arguments, that, the, deccan, traps, flood, basalts, caused, the, extinction, were, usually, linked, to, the, view, that, the, extinction, was, gradual, as, the, flood, basalt, events, were, thought, to, have, started, around, 68, mya, and, lasted, more, than, 2, million, years, the, most, recent, evidence, shows, that, the, traps, erupted, over, a, period, of, only, 800, 000, years, spanning, the, k, pg, boundary, and, therefore, may, be, responsible, for, the, extinction, and, the, delayed, biotic, recovery, thereafter, the, deccan, traps, could, have, caused, extinction, through, several, mechanisms, including, the, release, of, dust, and, sulfuric, aerosols, into, the, air, which, might, have, blocked, sunlight, and, thereby, reduced, photosynthesis, in, plants, in, addition, the, latest, cretaceous, saw, a, rise, in, global, temperatures, deccan, traps, volcanism, resulted, in, carbon, dioxide, emissions, that, increased, the, greenhouse, effect, when, the, dust, and, aerosols, cleared, from, the, atmosphere, plant, fossils, record, a, 250, ppm, increase, in, carbon, dioxide, concentrations, across, the, k, pg, boundary, likely, attributable, to, deccan, traps, activity, the, increased, carbon, dioxide, emissions, also, caused, acid, rain, evidenced, by, increased, mercury, deposition, due, to, increased, solubility, of, mercury, compounds, in, more, acidic, water, evidence, for, extinctions, caused, by, the, deccan, traps, includes, the, reduction, in, diversity, of, marine, life, when, the, climate, near, the, k, pg, boundary, increased, in, temperature, the, temperature, increased, about, three, to, four, degrees, very, rapidly, between, 65, 4, and, 65, 2, million, years, ago, which, is, very, near, the, time, of, the, extinction, event, not, only, did, the, climate, temperature, increase, but, the, water, temperature, decreased, causing, a, drastic, decrease, in, marine, diversity, evidence, from, tunisia, indicates, that, marine, life, was, deleteriously, affected, by, a, major, period, of, increased, warmth, and, humidity, linked, to, a, pulse, of, intense, deccan, traps, activity, and, that, marine, extinctions, there, began, before, the, impact, event, charophyte, declines, in, the, songliao, basin, china, before, the, asteroid, impact, have, been, concluded, to, be, connected, to, climate, changes, caused, by, deccan, traps, activity, in, the, years, when, the, deccan, traps, hypothesis, was, linked, to, a, slower, extinction, luis, alvarez, d, 1988, replied, that, paleontologists, were, being, misled, by, sparse, data, while, his, assertion, was, not, initially, well, received, later, intensive, field, studies, of, fossil, beds, lent, weight, to, his, claim, eventually, most, paleontologists, began, to, accept, the, idea, that, the, mass, extinctions, at, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, were, largely, or, at, least, partly, due, to, a, massive, earth, impact, even, walter, alvarez, acknowledged, that, other, major, changes, might, have, contributed, to, the, extinctions, more, recent, arguments, against, the, deccan, traps, as, an, extinction, cause, include, that, the, timeline, of, deccan, traps, activity, and, pulses, of, climate, change, has, been, found, by, some, studies, to, be, asynchronous, that, palynological, changes, do, not, coincide, with, intervals, of, volcanism, and, that, many, sites, show, climatic, stability, during, the, latest, maastrichtian, and, no, sign, of, major, disruptions, caused, by, volcanism, multiple, modelling, studies, conclude, that, an, impact, event, not, volcanism, fits, best, with, available, evidence, of, extinction, patterns, combining, these, theories, some, geophysical, models, suggest, that, the, impact, contributed, to, the, deccan, traps, these, models, combined, with, high, precision, radiometric, dating, suggest, that, the, chicxulub, impact, could, have, triggered, some, of, the, largest, deccan, eruptions, as, well, as, eruptions, at, active, volcano, sites, anywhere, on, earth, there, is, clear, evidence, that, sea, levels, fell, in, the, final, stage, of, the, cretaceous, by, more, than, at, any, other, time, in, the, mesozoic, era, in, some, maastrichtian, stage, rock, layers, from, various, parts, of, the, world, the, later, layers, are, terrestrial, earlier, layers, represent, shorelines, and, the, earliest, layers, represent, seabeds, these, layers, do, not, show, the, tilting, and, distortion, associated, with, mountain, building, therefore, the, likeliest, explanation, is, a, regression, a, drop, in, sea, level, there, is, no, direct, evidence, for, the, cause, of, the, regression, but, the, currently, accepted, explanation, is, that, the, mid, ocean, ridges, became, less, active, and, sank, under, their, own, weight, a, severe, regression, would, have, greatly, reduced, the, continental, shelf, area, the, most, species, rich, part, of, the, sea, and, therefore, could, have, been, enough, to, cause, a, marine, mass, extinction, this, change, would, not, have, caused, the, extinction, of, the, ammonites, the, regression, would, also, have, caused, climate, changes, partly, by, disrupting, winds, and, ocean, currents, and, partly, by, reducing, the, earth, s, albedo, and, increasing, global, temperatures, marine, regression, also, resulted, in, the, loss, of, epeiric, seas, such, as, the, western, interior, seaway, of, north, america, the, loss, of, these, seas, greatly, altered, habitats, removing, coastal, plains, that, ten, million, years, before, had, been, host, to, diverse, communities, such, as, are, found, in, rocks, of, the, dinosaur, park, formation, another, consequence, was, an, expansion, of, freshwater, environments, since, continental, runoff, now, had, longer, distances, to, travel, before, reaching, oceans, while, this, change, was, favorable, to, freshwater, vertebrates, those, that, prefer, marine, environments, such, as, sharks, suffered, however, sea, level, fall, as, a, cause, of, the, extinction, event, is, contradicted, by, other, evidence, namely, that, sections, which, show, no, sign, of, marine, regression, still, show, evidence, of, a, major, drop, in, diversity, proponents, of, multiple, causation, view, the, suggested, single, causes, as, either, too, small, to, produce, the, vast, scale, of, the, extinction, or, not, likely, to, produce, its, observed, taxonomic, pattern, in, a, review, article, j, david, archibald, and, david, e, fastovsky, discussed, a, scenario, combining, three, major, postulated, causes, volcanism, marine, regression, and, extraterrestrial, impact, in, this, scenario, terrestrial, and, marine, communities, were, stressed, by, the, changes, in, and, loss, of, habitats, dinosaurs, as, the, largest, vertebrates, were, the, first, affected, by, environmental, changes, and, their, diversity, declined, at, the, same, time, particulate, materials, from, volcanism, cooled, and, dried, areas, of, the, globe, then, an, impact, event, occurred, causing, collapses, in, photosynthesis, based, food, chains, both, in, the, already, stressed, terrestrial, food, chains, and, in, the, marine, food, chains, based, on, studies, at, seymour, island, in, antarctica, sierra, petersen, and, colleagues, argue, that, there, were, two, separate, extinction, events, near, the, cretaceous, paleogene, boundary, with, one, correlating, to, deccan, trap, volcanism, and, one, correlated, with, the, chicxulub, impact, the, team, analyzed, combined, extinction, patterns, using, a, new, clumped, isotope, temperature, record, from, a, hiatus, free, expanded, k, pg, boundary, section, they, documented, a, 7, 8, 3, 3, c, warming, synchronous, with, the, onset, of, deccan, traps, volcanism, and, a, second, smaller, warming, at, the, time, of, meteorite, impact, they, suggested, that, local, warming, had, been, amplified, due, to, the, simultaneous, disappearance, of, continental, or, sea, ice, intra, shell, variability, indicates, a, possible, reduction, in, seasonality, after, deccan, eruptions, began, continuing, through, the, meteorite, event, species, extinction, at, seymour, island, occurred, in, two, pulses, that, coincide, with, the, two, observed, warming, events, directly, linking, the, end, cretaceous, extinction, at, this, site, to, both, volcanic, and, meteorite, events, via, climate, change
