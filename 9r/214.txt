physical, cosmology, is, a, branch, of, cosmology, concerned, with, the, study, of, cosmological, models, a, cosmological, model, or, simply, cosmology, provides, a, description, of, the, largest, scale, structures, and, dynamics, of, the, universe, and, allows, study, of, fundamental, questions, about, its, origin, structure, evolution, and, ultimate, fate, cosmology, as, a, science, originated, with, the, copernican, principle, which, implies, that, celestial, bodies, obey, identical, physical, laws, to, those, on, earth, and, newtonian, mechanics, which, first, allowed, those, physical, laws, to, be, understood, physical, cosmology, as, it, is, now, understood, began, in, 1915, with, the, development, of, albert, einstein, s, general, theory, of, relativity, followed, by, major, observational, discoveries, in, the, 1920s, first, edwin, hubble, discovered, that, the, universe, contains, a, huge, number, of, external, galaxies, beyond, the, milky, way, then, work, by, vesto, slipher, and, others, showed, that, the, universe, is, expanding, these, advances, made, it, possible, to, speculate, about, the, origin, of, the, universe, and, allowed, the, establishment, of, the, big, bang, theory, by, georges, lema, tre, as, the, leading, cosmological, model, a, few, researchers, still, advocate, a, handful, of, alternative, cosmologies, however, most, cosmologists, agree, that, the, big, bang, theory, best, explains, the, observations, dramatic, advances, in, observational, cosmology, since, the, 1990s, including, the, cosmic, microwave, background, distant, supernovae, and, galaxy, redshift, surveys, have, led, to, the, development, of, a, standard, model, of, cosmology, this, model, requires, the, universe, to, contain, large, amounts, of, dark, matter, and, dark, energy, whose, nature, is, currently, not, well, understood, but, the, model, gives, detailed, predictions, that, are, in, excellent, agreement, with, many, diverse, observations, cosmology, draws, heavily, on, the, work, of, many, disparate, areas, of, research, in, theoretical, and, applied, physics, areas, relevant, to, cosmology, include, particle, physics, experiments, and, theory, theoretical, and, observational, astrophysics, general, relativity, quantum, mechanics, and, plasma, physics, modern, cosmology, developed, along, tandem, tracks, of, theory, and, observation, in, 1916, albert, einstein, published, his, theory, of, general, relativity, which, provided, a, unified, description, of, gravity, as, a, geometric, property, of, space, and, time, at, the, time, einstein, believed, in, a, static, universe, but, found, that, his, original, formulation, of, the, theory, did, not, permit, it, this, is, because, masses, distributed, throughout, the, universe, gravitationally, attract, and, move, toward, each, other, over, time, however, he, realized, that, his, equations, permitted, the, introduction, of, a, constant, term, which, could, counteract, the, attractive, force, of, gravity, on, the, cosmic, scale, einstein, published, his, first, paper, on, relativistic, cosmology, in, 1917, in, which, he, added, this, cosmological, constant, to, his, field, equations, in, order, to, force, them, to, model, a, static, universe, the, einstein, model, describes, a, static, universe, space, is, finite, and, unbounded, analogous, to, the, surface, of, a, sphere, which, has, a, finite, area, but, no, edges, however, this, so, called, einstein, model, is, unstable, to, small, perturbations, it, will, eventually, start, to, expand, or, contract, it, was, later, realized, that, einstein, s, model, was, just, one, of, a, larger, set, of, possibilities, all, of, which, were, consistent, with, general, relativity, and, the, cosmological, principle, the, cosmological, solutions, of, general, relativity, were, found, by, alexander, friedmann, in, the, early, 1920s, his, equations, describe, the, friedmann, lema, tre, robertson, walker, universe, which, may, expand, or, contract, and, whose, geometry, may, be, open, flat, or, closed, in, the, 1910s, vesto, slipher, and, later, carl, wilhelm, wirtz, interpreted, the, red, shift, of, spiral, nebulae, as, a, doppler, shift, that, indicated, they, were, receding, from, earth, however, it, is, difficult, to, determine, the, distance, to, astronomical, objects, one, way, is, to, compare, the, physical, size, of, an, object, to, its, angular, size, but, a, physical, size, must, be, assumed, to, do, this, another, method, is, to, measure, the, brightness, of, an, object, and, assume, an, intrinsic, luminosity, from, which, the, distance, may, be, determined, using, the, inverse, square, law, due, to, the, difficulty, of, using, these, methods, they, did, not, realize, that, the, nebulae, were, actually, galaxies, outside, our, own, milky, way, nor, did, they, speculate, about, the, cosmological, implications, in, 1927, the, belgian, roman, catholic, priest, georges, lema, tre, independently, derived, the, friedmann, lema, tre, robertson, walker, equations, and, proposed, on, the, basis, of, the, recession, of, spiral, nebulae, that, the, universe, began, with, the, explosion, of, a, primeval, atom, which, was, later, called, the, big, bang, in, 1929, edwin, hubble, provided, an, observational, basis, for, lema, tre, s, theory, hubble, showed, that, the, spiral, nebulae, were, galaxies, by, determining, their, distances, using, measurements, of, the, brightness, of, cepheid, variable, stars, he, discovered, a, relationship, between, the, redshift, of, a, galaxy, and, its, distance, he, interpreted, this, as, evidence, that, the, galaxies, are, receding, from, earth, in, every, direction, at, speeds, proportional, to, their, distance, this, fact, is, now, known, as, hubble, s, law, though, the, numerical, factor, hubble, found, relating, recessional, velocity, and, distance, was, off, by, a, factor, of, ten, due, to, not, knowing, about, the, types, of, cepheid, variables, given, the, cosmological, principle, hubble, s, law, suggested, that, the, universe, was, expanding, two, primary, explanations, were, proposed, for, the, expansion, one, was, lema, tre, s, big, bang, theory, advocated, and, developed, by, george, gamow, the, other, explanation, was, fred, hoyle, s, steady, state, model, in, which, new, matter, is, created, as, the, galaxies, move, away, from, each, other, in, this, model, the, universe, is, roughly, the, same, at, any, point, in, time, for, a, number, of, years, support, for, these, theories, was, evenly, divided, however, the, observational, evidence, began, to, support, the, idea, that, the, universe, evolved, from, a, hot, dense, state, the, discovery, of, the, cosmic, microwave, background, in, 1965, lent, strong, support, to, the, big, bang, model, and, since, the, precise, measurements, of, the, cosmic, microwave, background, by, the, cosmic, background, explorer, in, the, early, 1990s, few, cosmologists, have, seriously, proposed, other, theories, of, the, origin, and, evolution, of, the, cosmos, one, consequence, of, this, is, that, in, standard, general, relativity, the, universe, began, with, a, singularity, as, demonstrated, by, roger, penrose, and, stephen, hawking, in, the, 1960s, an, alternative, view, to, extend, the, big, bang, model, suggesting, the, universe, had, no, beginning, or, singularity, and, the, age, of, the, universe, is, infinite, has, been, presented, in, september, 2023, astrophysicists, questioned, the, overall, current, view, of, the, universe, in, the, form, of, the, standard, model, of, cosmology, based, on, the, latest, james, webb, space, telescope, studies, the, lightest, chemical, elements, primarily, hydrogen, and, helium, were, created, during, the, big, bang, through, the, process, of, nucleosynthesis, in, a, sequence, of, stellar, nucleosynthesis, reactions, smaller, atomic, nuclei, are, then, combined, into, larger, atomic, nuclei, ultimately, forming, stable, iron, group, elements, such, as, iron, and, nickel, which, have, the, highest, nuclear, binding, energies, the, net, process, results, in, a, later, energy, release, meaning, subsequent, to, the, big, bang, such, reactions, of, nuclear, particles, can, lead, to, sudden, energy, releases, from, cataclysmic, variable, stars, such, as, novae, gravitational, collapse, of, matter, into, black, holes, also, powers, the, most, energetic, processes, generally, seen, in, the, nuclear, regions, of, galaxies, forming, quasars, and, active, galaxies, cosmologists, cannot, explain, all, cosmic, phenomena, exactly, such, as, those, related, to, the, accelerating, expansion, of, the, universe, using, conventional, forms, of, energy, instead, cosmologists, propose, a, new, form, of, energy, called, dark, energy, that, permeates, all, space, one, hypothesis, is, that, dark, energy, is, just, the, vacuum, energy, a, component, of, empty, space, that, is, associated, with, the, virtual, particles, that, exist, due, to, the, uncertainty, principle, there, is, no, clear, way, to, define, the, total, energy, in, the, universe, using, the, most, widely, accepted, theory, of, gravity, general, relativity, therefore, it, remains, controversial, whether, the, total, energy, is, conserved, in, an, expanding, universe, for, instance, each, photon, that, travels, through, intergalactic, space, loses, energy, due, to, the, redshift, effect, this, energy, is, not, transferred, to, any, other, system, so, seems, to, be, permanently, lost, on, the, other, hand, some, cosmologists, insist, that, energy, is, conserved, in, some, sense, this, follows, the, law, of, conservation, of, energy, different, forms, of, energy, may, dominate, the, cosmos, relativistic, particles, which, are, referred, to, as, radiation, or, non, relativistic, particles, referred, to, as, matter, relativistic, particles, are, particles, whose, rest, mass, is, zero, or, negligible, compared, to, their, kinetic, energy, and, so, move, at, the, speed, of, light, or, very, close, to, it, non, relativistic, particles, have, much, higher, rest, mass, than, their, energy, and, so, move, much, slower, than, the, speed, of, light, as, the, universe, expands, both, matter, and, radiation, become, diluted, however, the, energy, densities, of, radiation, and, matter, dilute, at, different, rates, as, a, particular, volume, expands, mass, energy, density, is, changed, only, by, the, increase, in, volume, but, the, energy, density, of, radiation, is, changed, both, by, the, increase, in, volume, and, by, the, increase, in, the, wavelength, of, the, photons, that, make, it, up, thus, the, energy, of, radiation, becomes, a, smaller, part, of, the, universe, s, total, energy, than, that, of, matter, as, it, expands, the, very, early, universe, is, said, to, have, been, radiation, dominated, and, radiation, controlled, the, deceleration, of, expansion, later, as, the, average, energy, per, photon, becomes, roughly, 10, ev, and, lower, matter, dictates, the, rate, of, deceleration, and, the, universe, is, said, to, be, matter, dominated, the, intermediate, case, is, not, treated, well, analytically, as, the, expansion, of, the, universe, continues, matter, dilutes, even, further, and, the, cosmological, constant, becomes, dominant, leading, to, an, acceleration, in, the, universe, s, expansion, the, history, of, the, universe, is, a, central, issue, in, cosmology, the, history, of, the, universe, is, divided, into, different, periods, called, epochs, according, to, the, dominant, forces, and, processes, in, each, period, the, standard, cosmological, model, is, known, as, the, lambda, cdm, model, within, the, standard, cosmological, model, the, equations, of, motion, governing, the, universe, as, a, whole, are, derived, from, general, relativity, with, a, small, positive, cosmological, constant, the, solution, is, an, expanding, universe, due, to, this, expansion, the, radiation, and, matter, in, the, universe, cool, down, and, become, diluted, at, first, the, expansion, is, slowed, down, by, gravitation, attracting, the, radiation, and, matter, in, the, universe, however, as, these, become, diluted, the, cosmological, constant, becomes, more, dominant, and, the, expansion, of, the, universe, starts, to, accelerate, rather, than, decelerate, in, our, universe, this, happened, billions, of, years, ago, during, the, earliest, moments, of, the, universe, the, average, energy, density, was, very, high, making, knowledge, of, particle, physics, critical, to, understanding, this, environment, hence, scattering, processes, and, decay, of, unstable, elementary, particles, are, important, for, cosmological, models, of, this, period, as, a, rule, of, thumb, a, scattering, or, a, decay, process, is, cosmologically, important, in, a, certain, epoch, if, the, time, scale, describing, that, process, is, smaller, than, or, comparable, to, the, time, scale, of, the, expansion, of, the, universe, the, time, scale, that, describes, the, expansion, of, the, universe, is, 1, h, displaystyle, 1, h, with, h, displaystyle, h, being, the, hubble, parameter, which, varies, with, time, the, expansion, timescale, 1, h, displaystyle, 1, h, is, roughly, equal, to, the, age, of, the, universe, at, each, point, in, time, observations, suggest, that, the, universe, began, around, 13, 8, billion, years, ago, since, then, the, evolution, of, the, universe, has, passed, through, three, phases, the, very, early, universe, which, is, still, poorly, understood, was, the, split, second, in, which, the, universe, was, so, hot, that, particles, had, energies, higher, than, those, currently, accessible, in, particle, accelerators, on, earth, therefore, while, the, basic, features, of, this, epoch, have, been, worked, out, in, the, big, bang, theory, the, details, are, largely, based, on, educated, guesses, following, this, in, the, early, universe, the, evolution, of, the, universe, proceeded, according, to, known, high, energy, physics, this, is, when, the, first, protons, electrons, and, neutrons, formed, then, nuclei, and, finally, atoms, with, the, formation, of, neutral, hydrogen, the, cosmic, microwave, background, was, emitted, finally, the, epoch, of, structure, formation, began, when, matter, started, to, aggregate, into, the, first, stars, and, quasars, and, ultimately, galaxies, clusters, of, galaxies, and, superclusters, formed, the, future, of, the, universe, is, not, yet, firmly, known, but, according, to, the, cdm, model, it, will, continue, expanding, forever, below, some, of, the, most, active, areas, of, inquiry, in, cosmology, are, described, in, roughly, chronological, order, this, does, not, include, all, of, the, big, bang, cosmology, which, is, presented, in, timeline, of, the, big, bang, the, early, hot, universe, appears, to, be, well, explained, by, the, big, bang, from, roughly, 10, 33, seconds, onwards, but, there, are, several, problems, one, is, that, there, is, no, compelling, reason, using, current, particle, physics, for, the, universe, to, be, flat, homogeneous, and, isotropic, see, the, cosmological, principle, moreover, grand, unified, theories, of, particle, physics, suggest, that, there, should, be, magnetic, monopoles, in, the, universe, which, have, not, been, found, these, problems, are, resolved, by, a, brief, period, of, cosmic, inflation, which, drives, the, universe, to, flatness, smooths, out, anisotropies, and, inhomogeneities, to, the, observed, level, and, exponentially, dilutes, the, monopoles, the, physical, model, behind, cosmic, inflation, is, extremely, simple, but, it, has, not, yet, been, confirmed, by, particle, physics, and, there, are, difficult, problems, reconciling, inflation, and, quantum, field, theory, some, cosmologists, think, that, string, theory, and, brane, cosmology, will, provide, an, alternative, to, inflation, another, major, problem, in, cosmology, is, what, caused, the, universe, to, contain, far, more, matter, than, antimatter, cosmologists, can, observationally, deduce, that, the, universe, is, not, split, into, regions, of, matter, and, antimatter, if, it, were, there, would, be, x, rays, and, gamma, rays, produced, as, a, result, of, annihilation, but, this, is, not, observed, therefore, some, process, in, the, early, universe, must, have, created, a, small, excess, of, matter, over, antimatter, and, this, currently, not, understood, process, is, called, baryogenesis, three, required, conditions, for, baryogenesis, were, derived, by, andrei, sakharov, in, 1967, and, requires, a, violation, of, the, particle, physics, symmetry, called, cp, symmetry, between, matter, and, antimatter, however, particle, accelerators, measure, too, small, a, violation, of, cp, symmetry, to, account, for, the, baryon, asymmetry, cosmologists, and, particle, physicists, look, for, additional, violations, of, the, cp, symmetry, in, the, early, universe, that, might, account, for, the, baryon, asymmetry, both, the, problems, of, baryogenesis, and, cosmic, inflation, are, very, closely, related, to, particle, physics, and, their, resolution, might, come, from, high, energy, theory, and, experiment, rather, than, through, observations, of, the, universe, big, bang, nucleosynthesis, is, the, theory, of, the, formation, of, the, elements, in, the, early, universe, it, finished, when, the, universe, was, about, three, minutes, old, and, its, temperature, dropped, below, that, at, which, nuclear, fusion, could, occur, big, bang, nucleosynthesis, had, a, brief, period, during, which, it, could, operate, so, only, the, very, lightest, elements, were, produced, starting, from, hydrogen, ions, protons, it, principally, produced, deuterium, helium, 4, and, lithium, other, elements, were, produced, in, only, trace, abundances, the, basic, theory, of, nucleosynthesis, was, developed, in, 1948, by, george, gamow, ralph, asher, alpher, and, robert, herman, it, was, used, for, many, years, as, a, probe, of, physics, at, the, time, of, the, big, bang, as, the, theory, of, big, bang, nucleosynthesis, connects, the, abundances, of, primordial, light, elements, with, the, features, of, the, early, universe, specifically, it, can, be, used, to, test, the, equivalence, principle, to, probe, dark, matter, and, test, neutrino, physics, some, cosmologists, have, proposed, that, big, bang, nucleosynthesis, suggests, there, is, a, fourth, sterile, species, of, neutrino, the, cdm, lambda, cold, dark, matter, or, lambda, cdm, model, is, a, parametrization, of, the, big, bang, cosmological, model, in, which, the, universe, contains, a, cosmological, constant, denoted, by, lambda, greek, associated, with, dark, energy, and, cold, dark, matter, abbreviated, cdm, it, is, frequently, referred, to, as, the, standard, model, of, big, bang, cosmology, the, cosmic, microwave, background, is, radiation, left, over, from, decoupling, after, the, epoch, of, recombination, when, neutral, atoms, first, formed, at, this, point, radiation, produced, in, the, big, bang, stopped, thomson, scattering, from, charged, ions, the, radiation, first, observed, in, 1965, by, arno, penzias, and, robert, woodrow, wilson, has, a, perfect, thermal, black, body, spectrum, it, has, a, temperature, of, 2, 7, kelvins, today, and, is, isotropic, to, one, part, in, 10, 5, cosmological, perturbation, theory, which, describes, the, evolution, of, slight, inhomogeneities, in, the, early, universe, has, allowed, cosmologists, to, precisely, calculate, the, angular, power, spectrum, of, the, radiation, and, it, has, been, measured, by, the, recent, satellite, experiments, cobe, and, wmap, and, many, ground, and, balloon, based, experiments, such, as, degree, angular, scale, interferometer, cosmic, background, imager, and, boomerang, one, of, the, goals, of, these, efforts, is, to, measure, the, basic, parameters, of, the, lambda, cdm, model, with, increasing, accuracy, as, well, as, to, test, the, predictions, of, the, big, bang, model, and, look, for, new, physics, the, results, of, measurements, made, by, wmap, for, example, have, placed, limits, on, the, neutrino, masses, newer, experiments, such, as, quiet, and, the, atacama, cosmology, telescope, are, trying, to, measure, the, polarization, of, the, cosmic, microwave, background, these, measurements, are, expected, to, provide, further, confirmation, of, the, theory, as, well, as, information, about, cosmic, inflation, and, the, so, called, secondary, anisotropies, such, as, the, sunyaev, zel, dovich, effect, and, sachs, wolfe, effect, which, are, caused, by, interaction, between, galaxies, and, clusters, with, the, cosmic, microwave, background, on, 17, march, 2014, astronomers, of, the, bicep2, collaboration, announced, the, apparent, detection, of, b, mode, polarization, of, the, cmb, considered, to, be, evidence, of, primordial, gravitational, waves, that, are, predicted, by, the, theory, of, inflation, to, occur, during, the, earliest, phase, of, the, big, bang, however, later, that, year, the, planck, collaboration, provided, a, more, accurate, measurement, of, cosmic, dust, concluding, that, the, b, mode, signal, from, dust, is, the, same, strength, as, that, reported, from, bicep2, on, 30, january, 2015, a, joint, analysis, of, bicep2, and, planck, data, was, published, and, the, european, space, agency, announced, that, the, signal, can, be, entirely, attributed, to, interstellar, dust, in, the, milky, way, understanding, the, formation, and, evolution, of, the, largest, and, earliest, structures, i, e, quasars, galaxies, clusters, and, superclusters, is, one, of, the, largest, efforts, in, cosmology, cosmologists, study, a, model, of, hierarchical, structure, formation, in, which, structures, form, from, the, bottom, up, with, smaller, objects, forming, first, while, the, largest, objects, such, as, superclusters, are, still, assembling, one, way, to, study, structure, in, the, universe, is, to, survey, the, visible, galaxies, in, order, to, construct, a, three, dimensional, picture, of, the, galaxies, in, the, universe, and, measure, the, matter, power, spectrum, this, is, the, approach, of, the, sloan, digital, sky, survey, and, the, 2df, galaxy, redshift, survey, another, tool, for, understanding, structure, formation, is, simulations, which, cosmologists, use, to, study, the, gravitational, aggregation, of, matter, in, the, universe, as, it, clusters, into, filaments, superclusters, and, voids, most, simulations, contain, only, non, baryonic, cold, dark, matter, which, should, suffice, to, understand, the, universe, on, the, largest, scales, as, there, is, much, more, dark, matter, in, the, universe, than, visible, baryonic, matter, more, advanced, simulations, are, starting, to, include, baryons, and, study, the, formation, of, individual, galaxies, cosmologists, study, these, simulations, to, see, if, they, agree, with, the, galaxy, surveys, and, to, understand, any, discrepancy, other, complementary, observations, to, measure, the, distribution, of, matter, in, the, distant, universe, and, to, probe, reionization, include, these, will, help, cosmologists, settle, the, question, of, when, and, how, structure, formed, in, the, universe, evidence, from, big, bang, nucleosynthesis, the, cosmic, microwave, background, structure, formation, and, galaxy, rotation, curves, suggests, that, about, 23, of, the, mass, of, the, universe, consists, of, non, baryonic, dark, matter, whereas, only, 4, consists, of, visible, baryonic, matter, the, gravitational, effects, of, dark, matter, are, well, understood, as, it, behaves, like, a, cold, non, radiative, fluid, that, forms, haloes, around, galaxies, dark, matter, has, never, been, detected, in, the, laboratory, and, the, particle, physics, nature, of, dark, matter, remains, completely, unknown, without, observational, constraints, there, are, a, number, of, candidates, such, as, a, stable, supersymmetric, particle, a, weakly, interacting, massive, particle, a, gravitationally, interacting, massive, particle, an, axion, and, a, massive, compact, halo, object, alternatives, to, the, dark, matter, hypothesis, include, a, modification, of, gravity, at, small, accelerations, mond, or, an, effect, from, brane, cosmology, teves, is, a, version, of, mond, that, can, explain, gravitational, lensing, if, the, universe, is, flat, there, must, be, an, additional, component, making, up, 73, in, addition, to, the, 23, dark, matter, and, 4, baryons, of, the, energy, density, of, the, universe, this, is, called, dark, energy, in, order, not, to, interfere, with, big, bang, nucleosynthesis, and, the, cosmic, microwave, background, it, must, not, cluster, in, haloes, like, baryons, and, dark, matter, there, is, strong, observational, evidence, for, dark, energy, as, the, total, energy, density, of, the, universe, is, known, through, constraints, on, the, flatness, of, the, universe, but, the, amount, of, clustering, matter, is, tightly, measured, and, is, much, less, than, this, the, case, for, dark, energy, was, strengthened, in, 1999, when, measurements, demonstrated, that, the, expansion, of, the, universe, has, begun, to, gradually, accelerate, apart, from, its, density, and, its, clustering, properties, nothing, is, known, about, dark, energy, quantum, field, theory, predicts, a, cosmological, constant, cc, much, like, dark, energy, but, 120, orders, of, magnitude, larger, than, that, observed, steven, weinberg, and, a, number, of, string, theorists, see, string, landscape, have, invoked, the, weak, anthropic, principle, i, e, the, reason, that, physicists, observe, a, universe, with, such, a, small, cosmological, constant, is, that, no, physicists, or, any, life, could, exist, in, a, universe, with, a, larger, cosmological, constant, many, cosmologists, find, this, an, unsatisfying, explanation, perhaps, because, while, the, weak, anthropic, principle, is, self, evident, given, that, living, observers, exist, there, must, be, at, least, one, universe, with, a, cosmological, constant, which, allows, for, life, to, exist, it, does, not, attempt, to, explain, the, context, of, that, universe, for, example, the, weak, anthropic, principle, alone, does, not, distinguish, between, other, possible, explanations, for, dark, energy, include, quintessence, or, a, modification, of, gravity, on, the, largest, scales, the, effect, on, cosmology, of, the, dark, energy, that, these, models, describe, is, given, by, the, dark, energy, s, equation, of, state, which, varies, depending, upon, the, theory, the, nature, of, dark, energy, is, one, of, the, most, challenging, problems, in, cosmology, a, better, understanding, of, dark, energy, is, likely, to, solve, the, problem, of, the, ultimate, fate, of, the, universe, in, the, current, cosmological, epoch, the, accelerated, expansion, due, to, dark, energy, is, preventing, structures, larger, than, superclusters, from, forming, it, is, not, known, whether, the, acceleration, will, continue, indefinitely, perhaps, even, increasing, until, a, big, rip, or, whether, it, will, eventually, reverse, lead, to, a, big, freeze, or, follow, some, other, scenario, gravitational, waves, are, ripples, in, the, curvature, of, spacetime, that, propagate, as, waves, at, the, speed, of, light, generated, in, certain, gravitational, interactions, that, propagate, outward, from, their, source, gravitational, wave, astronomy, is, an, emerging, branch, of, observational, astronomy, which, aims, to, use, gravitational, waves, to, collect, observational, data, about, sources, of, detectable, gravitational, waves, such, as, binary, star, systems, composed, of, white, dwarfs, neutron, stars, and, black, holes, and, events, such, as, supernovae, and, the, formation, of, the, early, universe, shortly, after, the, big, bang, in, 2016, the, ligo, scientific, collaboration, and, virgo, collaboration, teams, announced, that, they, had, made, the, first, observation, of, gravitational, waves, originating, from, a, pair, of, merging, black, holes, using, the, advanced, ligo, detectors, on, 15, june, 2016, a, second, detection, of, gravitational, waves, from, coalescing, black, holes, was, announced, besides, ligo, many, other, gravitational, wave, observatories, detectors, are, under, construction, cosmologists, also, study
