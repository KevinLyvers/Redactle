a, proton, is, a, stable, subatomic, particle, symbol, p, h, or, 1, h, with, a, positive, electric, charge, of, 1, e, elementary, charge, its, mass, is, slightly, less, than, the, mass, of, a, neutron, and, approximately, 1836, times, the, mass, of, an, electron, the, proton, to, electron, mass, ratio, protons, and, neutrons, each, with, a, mass, of, approximately, one, atomic, mass, unit, are, jointly, referred, to, as, nucleons, particles, present, in, atomic, nuclei, one, or, more, protons, are, present, in, the, nucleus, of, every, atom, they, provide, the, attractive, electrostatic, central, force, which, binds, the, atomic, electrons, the, number, of, protons, in, the, nucleus, is, the, defining, property, of, an, element, and, is, referred, to, as, the, atomic, number, represented, by, the, symbol, z, since, each, element, is, identified, by, the, number, of, protons, in, its, nucleus, each, element, has, its, own, atomic, number, which, determines, the, number, of, atomic, electrons, and, consequently, the, chemical, characteristics, of, the, element, the, word, proton, is, greek, for, first, and, the, name, was, given, to, the, hydrogen, nucleus, by, ernest, rutherford, in, 1920, in, previous, years, rutherford, had, discovered, that, the, hydrogen, nucleus, known, to, be, the, lightest, nucleus, could, be, extracted, from, the, nuclei, of, nitrogen, by, atomic, collisions, protons, were, therefore, a, candidate, to, be, a, fundamental, or, elementary, particle, and, hence, a, building, block, of, nitrogen, and, all, other, heavier, atomic, nuclei, although, protons, were, originally, considered, to, be, elementary, particles, in, the, modern, standard, model, of, particle, physics, protons, are, known, to, be, composite, particles, containing, three, valence, quarks, and, together, with, neutrons, are, now, classified, as, hadrons, protons, are, composed, of, two, up, quarks, of, charge, 2, 3, e, each, and, one, down, quark, of, charge, 1, 3, e, the, rest, masses, of, quarks, contribute, only, about, 1, of, a, proton, s, mass, the, remainder, of, a, proton, s, mass, is, due, to, quantum, chromodynamics, binding, energy, which, includes, the, kinetic, energy, of, the, quarks, and, the, energy, of, the, gluon, fields, that, bind, the, quarks, together, the, root, mean, square, charge, radius, of, a, proton, is, about, 0, 84, 0, 87, fm, 1, fm, 10, 15, m, in, 2019, two, different, studies, using, different, techniques, found, this, radius, to, be, 0, 833, fm, with, an, uncertainty, of, 0, 010, fm, free, protons, occur, occasionally, on, earth, thunderstorms, can, produce, protons, with, energies, of, up, to, several, tens, of, mev, at, sufficiently, low, temperatures, and, kinetic, energies, free, protons, will, bind, to, electrons, however, the, character, of, such, bound, protons, does, not, change, and, they, remain, protons, a, fast, proton, moving, through, matter, will, slow, by, interactions, with, electrons, and, nuclei, until, it, is, captured, by, the, electron, cloud, of, an, atom, the, result, is, a, diatomic, or, polyatomic, ion, containing, hydrogen, in, a, vacuum, when, free, electrons, are, present, a, sufficiently, slow, proton, may, pick, up, a, single, free, electron, becoming, a, neutral, hydrogen, atom, which, is, chemically, a, free, radical, such, free, hydrogen, atoms, tend, to, react, chemically, with, many, other, types, of, atoms, at, sufficiently, low, energies, when, free, hydrogen, atoms, react, with, each, other, they, form, neutral, hydrogen, molecules, h, 2, which, are, the, most, common, molecular, component, of, molecular, clouds, in, interstellar, space, free, protons, are, routinely, used, for, accelerators, for, proton, therapy, or, various, particle, physics, experiments, with, the, most, powerful, example, being, the, large, hadron, collider, protons, are, spin, 1, 2, fermions, and, are, composed, of, three, valence, quarks, making, them, baryons, a, sub, type, of, hadrons, the, two, up, quarks, and, one, down, quark, of, a, proton, are, held, together, by, the, strong, force, mediated, by, gluons, 21, 22, a, modern, perspective, has, a, proton, composed, of, the, valence, quarks, up, up, down, the, gluons, and, transitory, pairs, of, sea, quarks, protons, have, a, positive, charge, distribution, which, decays, approximately, exponentially, with, a, root, mean, square, charge, radius, of, about, 0, 8, fm, protons, and, neutrons, are, both, nucleons, which, may, be, bound, together, by, the, nuclear, force, to, form, atomic, nuclei, the, nucleus, of, the, most, common, isotope, of, the, hydrogen, atom, with, the, chemical, symbol, h, is, a, lone, proton, the, nuclei, of, the, heavy, hydrogen, isotopes, deuterium, and, tritium, contain, one, proton, bound, to, one, and, two, neutrons, respectively, all, other, types, of, atomic, nuclei, are, composed, of, two, or, more, protons, and, various, numbers, of, neutrons, the, concept, of, a, hydrogen, like, particle, as, a, constituent, of, other, atoms, was, developed, over, a, long, period, as, early, as, 1815, william, prout, proposed, that, all, atoms, are, composed, of, hydrogen, atoms, which, he, called, protyles, based, on, a, simplistic, interpretation, of, early, values, of, atomic, weights, see, prout, s, hypothesis, which, was, disproved, when, more, accurate, values, were, measured, 39, 42, in, 1886, eugen, goldstein, discovered, canal, rays, also, known, as, anode, rays, and, showed, that, they, were, positively, charged, particles, ions, produced, from, gases, however, since, particles, from, different, gases, had, different, values, of, charge, to, mass, ratio, q, m, they, could, not, be, identified, with, a, single, particle, unlike, the, negative, electrons, discovered, by, j, j, thomson, wilhelm, wien, in, 1898, identified, the, hydrogen, ion, as, the, particle, with, the, highest, charge, to, mass, ratio, in, ionized, gases, following, the, discovery, of, the, atomic, nucleus, by, ernest, rutherford, in, 1911, antonius, van, den, broek, proposed, that, the, place, of, each, element, in, the, periodic, table, its, atomic, number, is, equal, to, its, nuclear, charge, this, was, confirmed, experimentally, by, henry, moseley, in, 1913, using, x, ray, spectra, more, details, in, atomic, number, under, moseley, s, 1913, experiment, in, 1917, rutherford, performed, experiments, reported, in, 1919, and, 1925, which, proved, that, the, hydrogen, nucleus, is, present, in, other, nuclei, a, result, usually, described, as, the, discovery, of, protons, these, experiments, began, after, rutherford, observed, that, when, alpha, particles, would, strike, air, rutherford, could, detect, scintillation, on, a, zinc, sulfide, screen, produced, at, a, distance, well, beyond, the, distance, of, alpha, particle, range, of, travel, but, instead, corresponding, to, the, range, of, travel, of, hydrogen, atoms, protons, after, experimentation, rutherford, traced, the, reaction, to, the, nitrogen, in, air, and, found, that, when, alpha, particles, were, introduced, into, pure, nitrogen, gas, the, effect, was, larger, in, 1919, rutherford, assumed, that, the, alpha, particle, merely, knocked, a, proton, out, of, nitrogen, turning, it, into, carbon, after, observing, blackett, s, cloud, chamber, images, in, 1925, rutherford, realized, that, the, alpha, particle, was, absorbed, if, the, alpha, particle, were, not, absorbed, then, it, would, knock, a, proton, off, of, nitrogen, creating, 3, charged, particles, a, negatively, charged, carbon, a, proton, and, an, alpha, particle, it, can, be, shown, that, the, 3, charged, particles, would, create, three, tracks, in, the, cloud, chamber, but, instead, only, 2, tracks, in, the, cloud, chamber, were, observed, the, alpha, particle, is, absorbed, by, the, nitrogen, atom, after, capture, of, the, alpha, particle, a, hydrogen, nucleus, is, ejected, creating, a, net, result, of, 2, charged, particles, a, proton, and, a, positively, charged, oxygen, which, make, 2, tracks, in, the, cloud, chamber, heavy, oxygen, 17, o, not, carbon, or, fluorine, is, the, product, this, was, the, first, reported, nuclear, reaction, 14, n, 17, o, p, rutherford, at, first, thought, of, our, modern, p, in, this, equation, as, a, hydrogen, ion, h, depending, on, one, s, perspective, either, 1919, when, it, was, seen, experimentally, as, derived, from, another, source, than, hydrogen, or, 1920, when, it, was, recognized, and, proposed, as, an, elementary, particle, may, be, regarded, as, the, moment, when, the, proton, was, discovered, rutherford, knew, hydrogen, to, be, the, simplest, and, lightest, element, and, was, influenced, by, prout, s, hypothesis, that, hydrogen, was, the, building, block, of, all, elements, discovery, that, the, hydrogen, nucleus, is, present, in, other, nuclei, as, an, elementary, particle, led, rutherford, to, give, the, hydrogen, nucleus, h, a, special, name, as, a, particle, since, he, suspected, that, hydrogen, the, lightest, element, contained, only, one, of, these, particles, he, named, this, new, fundamental, building, block, of, the, nucleus, the, proton, after, the, neuter, singular, of, the, greek, word, for, first, however, rutherford, also, had, in, mind, the, word, protyle, as, used, by, prout, rutherford, spoke, at, the, british, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, at, its, cardiff, meeting, beginning, 24, august, 1920, at, the, meeting, he, was, asked, by, oliver, lodge, for, a, new, name, for, the, positive, hydrogen, nucleus, to, avoid, confusion, with, the, neutral, hydrogen, atom, he, initially, suggested, both, proton, and, prouton, after, prout, rutherford, later, reported, that, the, meeting, had, accepted, his, suggestion, that, the, hydrogen, nucleus, be, named, the, proton, following, prout, s, word, protyle, the, first, use, of, the, word, proton, in, the, scientific, literature, appeared, in, 1920, one, or, more, bound, protons, are, present, in, the, nucleus, of, every, atom, free, protons, are, found, naturally, in, a, number, of, situations, in, which, energies, or, temperatures, are, high, enough, to, separate, them, from, electrons, for, which, they, have, some, affinity, free, protons, exist, in, plasmas, in, which, temperatures, are, too, high, to, allow, them, to, combine, with, electrons, free, protons, of, high, energy, and, velocity, make, up, 90, of, cosmic, rays, which, propagate, through, the, interstellar, medium, free, protons, are, emitted, directly, from, atomic, nuclei, in, some, rare, types, of, radioactive, decay, protons, also, result, along, with, electrons, and, antineutrinos, from, the, radioactive, decay, of, free, neutrons, which, are, unstable, the, spontaneous, decay, of, free, protons, has, never, been, observed, and, protons, are, therefore, considered, stable, particles, according, to, the, standard, model, however, some, grand, unified, theories, guts, of, particle, physics, predict, that, proton, decay, should, take, place, with, lifetimes, between, 10, 31, and, 10, 36, years, experimental, searches, have, established, lower, bounds, on, the, mean, lifetime, of, a, proton, for, various, assumed, decay, products, experiments, at, the, super, kamiokande, detector, in, japan, gave, lower, limits, for, proton, mean, lifetime, of, 6, 6, 10, 33, years, for, decay, to, an, antimuon, and, a, neutral, pion, and, 8, 2, 10, 33, years, for, decay, to, a, positron, and, a, neutral, pion, another, experiment, at, the, sudbury, neutrino, observatory, in, canada, searched, for, gamma, rays, resulting, from, residual, nuclei, resulting, from, the, decay, of, a, proton, from, oxygen, 16, this, experiment, was, designed, to, detect, decay, to, any, product, and, established, a, lower, limit, to, a, proton, lifetime, of, 2, 1, 10, 29, years, however, protons, are, known, to, transform, into, neutrons, through, the, process, of, electron, capture, also, called, inverse, beta, decay, for, free, protons, this, process, does, not, occur, spontaneously, but, only, when, energy, is, supplied, the, equation, is, the, process, is, reversible, neutrons, can, convert, back, to, protons, through, beta, decay, a, common, form, of, radioactive, decay, in, fact, a, free, neutron, decays, this, way, with, a, mean, lifetime, of, about, 15, minutes, a, proton, can, also, transform, into, a, neutron, through, beta, plus, decay, decay, according, to, quantum, field, theory, the, mean, proper, lifetime, of, protons, p, displaystyle, tau, mathrm, p, becomes, finite, when, they, are, accelerating, with, proper, acceleration, a, displaystyle, a, and, p, displaystyle, tau, mathrm, p, decreases, with, increasing, a, displaystyle, a, acceleration, gives, rise, to, a, non, vanishing, probability, for, the, transition, p, n, e, e, this, was, a, matter, of, concern, in, the, later, 1990s, because, p, displaystyle, tau, mathrm, p, is, a, scalar, that, can, be, measured, by, the, inertial, and, coaccelerated, observers, in, the, inertial, frame, the, accelerating, proton, should, decay, according, to, the, formula, above, however, according, to, the, coaccelerated, observer, the, proton, is, at, rest, and, hence, should, not, decay, this, puzzle, is, solved, by, realizing, that, in, the, coaccelerated, frame, there, is, a, thermal, bath, due, to, fulling, davies, unruh, effect, an, intrinsic, effect, of, quantum, field, theory, in, this, thermal, bath, experienced, by, the, proton, there, are, electrons, and, antineutrinos, with, which, the, proton, may, interact, according, to, the, processes, adding, the, contributions, of, each, of, these, processes, one, should, obtain, p, displaystyle, tau, mathrm, p, in, quantum, chromodynamics, the, modern, theory, of, the, nuclear, force, most, of, the, mass, of, protons, and, neutrons, is, explained, by, special, relativity, the, mass, of, a, proton, is, about, 80, 100, times, greater, than, the, sum, of, the, rest, masses, of, its, three, valence, quarks, while, the, gluons, have, zero, rest, mass, the, extra, energy, of, the, quarks, and, gluons, in, a, proton, as, compared, to, the, rest, energy, of, the, quarks, alone, in, the, qcd, vacuum, accounts, for, almost, 99, of, the, proton, s, mass, the, rest, mass, of, a, proton, is, thus, the, invariant, mass, of, the, system, of, moving, quarks, and, gluons, that, make, up, the, particle, and, in, such, systems, even, the, energy, of, massless, particles, confined, to, a, system, is, still, measured, as, part, of, the, rest, mass, of, the, system, two, terms, are, used, in, referring, to, the, mass, of, the, quarks, that, make, up, protons, current, quark, mass, refers, to, the, mass, of, a, quark, by, itself, while, constituent, quark, mass, refers, to, the, current, quark, mass, plus, the, mass, of, the, gluon, particle, field, surrounding, the, quark, 285, 286, 150, 151, these, masses, typically, have, very, different, values, the, kinetic, energy, of, the, quarks, that, is, a, consequence, of, confinement, is, a, contribution, see, mass, in, special, relativity, using, lattice, qcd, calculations, the, contributions, to, the, mass, of, the, proton, are, the, quark, condensate, 9, comprising, the, up, and, down, quarks, and, a, sea, of, virtual, strange, quarks, the, quark, kinetic, energy, 32, the, gluon, kinetic, energy, 37, and, the, anomalous, gluonic, contribution, 23, comprising, contributions, from, condensates, of, all, quark, flavors, the, constituent, quark, model, wavefunction, for, the, proton, is, p, 1, 18, 2, u, d, u, 2, u, u, d, 2, d, u, u, u, u, d, u, d, u, u, d, u, d, u, u, d, u, u, u, u, d, displaystyle, mathrm, p, uparrow, rangle, tfrac, 1, sqrt, 18, left, 2, u, uparrow, d, downarrow, u, uparrow, rangle, 2, u,

of, protons, are, complicated, because, they, are, determined, by, the, quarks, exchanging, gluons, and, interacting, with, various, vacuum, condensates, lattice, qcd, provides, a, way, of, calculating, the, mass, of, a, proton, directly, from, the, theory, to, any, accuracy, in, principle, the, most, recent, calculations, claim, that, the, mass, is, determined, to, better, than, 4, accuracy, even, to, 1, accuracy, see, figure, s5, in, d, rr, et, al, these, claims, are, still, controversial, because, the, calculations, cannot, yet, be, done, with, quarks, as, light, as, they, are, in, the, real, world, this, means, that, the, predictions, are, found, by, a, process, of, extrapolation, which, can, introduce, systematic, errors, it, is, hard, to, tell, whether, these, errors, are, controlled, properly, because, the, quantities, that, are, compared, to, experiment, are, the, masses, of, the, hadrons, which, are, known, in, advance, these, recent, calculations, are, performed, by, massive, supercomputers, and, as, noted, by, boffi, and, pasquini, a, detailed, description, of, the, nucleon, structure, is, still, missing, because, long, distance, behavior, requires, a, nonperturbative, and, or, numerical, treatment, more, conceptual, approaches, to, the, structure, of, protons, are, the, topological, soliton, approach, originally, due, to, tony, skyrme, and, the, more, accurate, ads, qcd, approach, that, extends, it, to, include, a, string, theory, of, gluons, various, qcd, inspired, models, like, the, bag, model, and, the, constituent, quark, model, which, were, popular, in, the, 1980s, and, the, svz, sum, rules, which, allow, for, rough, approximate, mass, calculations, these, methods, do, not, have, the, same, accuracy, as, the, more, brute, force, lattice, qcd, methods, at, least, not, yet, the, codata, recommended, value, of, a, proton, s, charge, radius, is, 8, 4075, 64, 10, 16, m, the, radius, of, the, proton, is, defined, by, a, formula, that, can, be, calculated, by, quantum, electrodynamics, and, be, derived, from, either, atomic, spectroscopy, or, by, electron, proton, scattering, the, formula, involves, a, form, factor, related, to, the, two, dimensional, parton, diameter, of, the, proton, a, value, from, before, 2010, is, based, on, scattering, electrons, from, protons, followed, by, complex, calculation, involving, scattering, cross, section, based, on, rosenbluth, equation, for, momentum, transfer, cross, section, and, based, on, studies, of, the, atomic, energy, levels, of, hydrogen, and, deuterium, in, 2010, an, international, research, team, published, a, proton, charge, radius, measurement, via, the, lamb, shift, in, muonic, hydrogen, an, exotic, atom, made, of, a, proton, and, a, negatively, charged, muon, as, a, muon, is, 200, times, heavier, than, an, electron, resulting, in, a, smaller, atomic, orbital, it, is, much, more, sensitive, to, the, proton, s, charge, radius, and, thus, allows, a, more, precise, measurement, subsequent, improved, scattering, and, electron, spectroscopy, measurements, agree, with, the, new, small, radius, work, continues, to, refine, and, check, this, new, value, since, the, proton, is, composed, of, quarks, confined, by, gluons, an, equivalent, pressure, that, acts, on, the, quarks, can, be, defined, the, size, of, that, pressure, and, other, details, about, it, are, controversial, in, 2018, this, pressure, was, reported, to, be, on, the, order, 10, 35, pa, which, is, greater, than, the, pressure, inside, a, neutron, star, it, was, said, to, be, maximum, at, the, centre, positive, repulsive, to, a, radial, distance, of, about, 0, 6, fm, negative, attractive, at, greater, distances, and, very, weak, beyond, about, 2, fm, these, numbers, were, derived, by, a, combination, of, a, theoretical, model, and, experimental, compton, scattering, of, high, energy, electrons, however, these, results, have, been, challenged, as, also, being, consistent, with, zero, pressure, and, as, effectively, providing, the, pressure, profile, shape, by, selection, of, the, model, the, radius, of, the, hydrated, proton, appears, in, the, born, equation, for, calculating, the, hydration, enthalpy, of, hydronium, although, protons, have, affinity, for, oppositely, charged, electrons, this, is, a, relatively, low, energy, interaction, and, so, free, protons, must, lose, sufficient, velocity, and, kinetic, energy, in, order, to, become, closely, associated, and, bound, to, electrons, high, energy, protons, in, traversing, ordinary, matter, lose, energy, by, collisions, with, atomic, nuclei, and, by, ionization, of, atoms, removing, electrons, until, they, are, slowed, sufficiently, to, be, captured, by, the, electron, cloud, in, a, normal, atom, however, in, such, an, association, with, an, electron, the, character, of, the, bound, proton, is, not, changed, and, it, remains, a, proton, the, attraction, of, low, energy, free, protons, to, any, electrons, present, in, normal, matter, such, as, the, electrons, in, normal, atoms, causes, free, protons, to, stop, and, to, form, a, new, chemical, bond, with, an, atom, such, a, bond, happens, at, any, sufficiently, cold, temperature, that, is, comparable, to, temperatures, at, the, surface, of, the, sun, and, with, any, type, of, atom, thus, in, interaction, with, any, type, of, normal, non, plasma, matter, low, velocity, free, protons, do, not, remain, free, but, are, attracted, to, electrons, in, any, atom, or, molecule, with, which, they, come, into, contact, causing, the, proton, and, molecule, to, combine, such, molecules, are, then, said, to, be, protonated, and, chemically, they, are, simply, compounds, of, hydrogen, often, positively, charged, often, as, a, result, they, become, so, called, br, nsted, acids, for, example, a, proton, captured, by, a, water, molecule, in, water, becomes, hydronium, the, aqueous, cation, h, 3, o, in, chemistry, the, number, of, protons, in, the, nucleus, of, an, atom, is, known, as, the, atomic, number, which, determines, the, chemical, element, to, which, the, atom, belongs, for, example, the, atomic, number, of, chlorine, is, 17, this, means, that, each, chlorine, atom, has, 17, protons, and, that, all, atoms, with, 17, protons, are, chlorine, atoms, the, chemical, properties, of, each, atom, are, determined, by, the, number, of, negatively, charged, electrons, which, for, neutral, atoms, is, equal, to, the, number, of, positive, protons, so, that, the, total, charge, is, zero, for, example, a, neutral, chlorine, atom, has, 17, protons, and, 17, electrons, whereas, a, cl, anion, has, 17, protons, and, 18, electrons, for, a, total, charge, of, 1, all, atoms, of, a, given, element, are, not, necessarily, identical, however, the, number, of, neutrons, may, vary, to, form, different, isotopes, and, energy, levels, may, differ, resulting, in, different, nuclear, isomers, for, example, there, are, two, stable, isotopes, of, chlorine, 35, 17, cl, with, 35, 17, 18, neutrons, and, 37, 17, cl, with, 37, 17, 20, neutrons, the, proton, is, a, unique, chemical, species, being, a, bare, nucleus, as, a, consequence, it, has, no, independent, existence, in, the, condensed, state, and, is, invariably, found, bound, by, a, pair, of, electrons, to, another, atom, ross, stewart, the, proton, application, to, organic, chemistry, 1985, p, 1, in, chemistry, the, term, proton, refers, to, the, hydrogen, ion, h, since, the, atomic, number, of, hydrogen, is, 1, a, hydrogen, ion, has, no, electrons, and, corresponds, to, a, bare, nucleus, consisting, of, a, proton, and, 0, neutrons, for, the, most, abundant, isotope, protium, 1, 1, h, the, proton, is, a, bare, charge, with, only, about, 1, 64, 000, of, the, radius, of, a, hydrogen, atom, and, so, is, extremely, reactive, chemically, the, free, proton, thus, has, an, extremely, short, lifetime, in, chemical, systems, such, as, liquids, and, it, reacts, immediately, with, the, electron, cloud, of, any, available, molecule, in, aqueous, solution, it, forms, the, hydronium, ion, h, 3, o, which, in, turn, is, further, solvated, by, water, molecules, in, clusters, such, as, and, the, transfer, of, h, in, an, acid, base, reaction, is, usually, referred, to, as, proton, transfer, the, acid, is, referred, to, as, a, proton, donor, and, the, base, as, a, proton, acceptor, likewise, biochemical, terms, such, as, proton, pump, and, proton, channel, refer, to, the, movement, of, hydrated, h, ions, the, ion, produced, by, removing, the, electron, from, a, deuterium, atom, is, known, as, a, deuteron, not, a, proton, likewise, removing, an, electron, from, a, tritium, atom, produces, a, triton, also, in, chemistry, the, term, proton, nmr, refers, to, the, observation, of, hydrogen, 1, nuclei, in, mostly, organic, molecules, by, nuclear, magnetic, resonance, this, method, uses, the, quantized, spin, magnetic, moment, of, the, proton, which, is, due, to, its, angular, momentum, or, spin, which, in, turn, has, a, magnitude, of, one, half, the, reduced, planck, constant, 2, displaystyle, hbar, 2, the, name, refers, to, examination, of, protons, as, they, occur, in, protium, hydrogen, 1, atoms, in, compounds, and, does, not, imply, that, free, protons, exist, in, the, compound, being, studied, the, apollo, lunar, surface, experiments, packages, alsep, determined, that, more, than, 95, of, the, particles, in, the, solar, wind, are, electrons, and, protons, in, approximately, equal, numbers, because, the, solar, wind, spectrometer, made, continuous, measurements, it, was, possible, to, measure, how, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, affects, arriving, solar, wind, particles, for, about, two, thirds, of, each, orbit, the, moon, is, outside, of, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, at, these, times, a, typical, proton, density, was, 10, to, 20, per, cubic, centimeter, with, most, protons, having, velocities, between, 400, and, 650, kilometers, per, second, for, about, five, days, of, each, month, the, moon, is, inside, the, earth, s, geomagnetic, tail, and, typically, no, solar, wind, particles, were, detectable, for, the, remainder, of, each, lunar, orbit, the, moon, is, in, a, transitional, region, known, as, the, magnetosheath, where, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, affects, the, solar, wind, but, does, not, completely, exclude, it, in, this, region, the, particle, flux, is, reduced, with, typical, proton, velocities, of, 250, to, 450, kilometers, per, second, during, the, lunar, night, the, spectrometer, was, shielded, from, the, solar, wind, by, the, moon, and, no, solar, wind, particles, were, measured, protons, also, have, extrasolar, origin, from, galactic, cosmic, rays, where, they, make, up, about, 90, of, the, total, particle, flux, these, protons, often, have, higher, energy, than, solar, wind, protons, and, their, intensity, is, far, more, uniform, and, less, variable, than, protons, coming, from, the, sun, the, production, of, which, is, heavily, affected, by, solar, proton, events, such, as, coronal, mass, ejections, research, has, been, performed, on, the, dose, rate, effects, of, protons, as, typically, found, in, space, travel, on, human, health, to, be, more, specific, there, are, hopes, to, identify, what, specific, chromosomes, are, damaged, and, to, define, the, damage, during, cancer, development, from, proton, exposure, another, study, looks, into, determining, the, effects, of, exposure, to, proton, irradiation, on, neurochemical, and, behavioral, endpoints, including, dopaminergic, functioning, amphetamine, induced, conditioned, taste, aversion, learning, and, spatial, learning, and, memory, as, measured, by, the, morris, water, maze, electrical, charging, of, a, spacecraft, due, to, interplanetary, proton, bombardment, has, also, been, proposed, for, study, there, are, many, more, studies, that, pertain, to, space, travel, including, galactic, cosmic, rays, and, their, possible, health, effects, and, solar, proton, event, exposure, the, american, biostack, and, soviet, biorack, space, travel, experiments, have, demonstrated, the, severity, of, molecular, damage, induced, by, heavy, ions, on, microorganisms, including, artemia, cysts, cpt, symmetry, puts, strong, constraints, on, the, relative, properties, of, particles, and, antiparticles, and, therefore, is, open, to, stringent, tests, for, example, the, charges, of, a, proton, and, antiproton, must, sum, to, exactly, zero, this, equality, has, been, tested, to, one, part, in, 10, 8, the, equality, of, their, masses, has, also, been, tested, to, better, than, one, part, in, 10, 8, by, holding, antiprotons, in, a, penning, trap, the, equality, of, the, charge, to, mass, ratio, of, protons, and, antiprotons, has, been, tested, to, one, part, in, 6, 10, 9, the, magnetic, moment, of, antiprotons, has, been, measured, with, an, error, of, 8, 10, 3, nuclear, bohr, magnetons, and, is, found, to, be, equal, and, opposite, to, that, of, a, proton
