convection, is, single, or, multiphase, fluid, flow, that, occurs, spontaneously, due, to, the, combined, effects, of, material, property, heterogeneity, and, body, forces, on, a, fluid, most, commonly, density, and, gravity, see, buoyancy, when, the, cause, of, the, convection, is, unspecified, convection, due, to, the, effects, of, thermal, expansion, and, buoyancy, can, be, assumed, convection, may, also, take, place, in, soft, solids, or, mixtures, where, particles, can, flow, convective, flow, may, be, transient, such, as, when, a, multiphase, mixture, of, oil, and, water, separates, or, steady, state, see, convection, cell, the, convection, may, be, due, to, gravitational, electromagnetic, or, fictitious, body, forces, heat, transfer, by, natural, convection, plays, a, role, in, the, structure, of, earth, s, atmosphere, its, oceans, and, its, mantle, discrete, convective, cells, in, the, atmosphere, can, be, identified, by, clouds, with, stronger, convection, resulting, in, thunderstorms, natural, convection, also, plays, a, role, in, stellar, physics, convection, is, often, categorised, or, described, by, the, main, effect, causing, the, convective, flow, for, example, thermal, convection, convection, cannot, take, place, in, most, solids, because, neither, bulk, current, flows, nor, significant, diffusion, of, matter, can, take, place, granular, convection, is, a, similar, phenomenon, in, granular, material, instead, of, fluids, advection, is, fluid, motion, created, by, velocity, instead, of, thermal, gradients, convective, heat, transfer, is, the, intentional, use, of, convection, as, a, method, for, heat, transfer, convection, is, a, process, in, which, heat, is, carried, from, place, to, place, by, the, bulk, movement, of, a, fluid, and, gases, in, the, 1830s, in, the, bridgewater, treatises, the, term, convection, is, attested, in, a, scientific, sense, in, treatise, viii, by, william, prout, in, the, book, on, chemistry, it, says, this, motion, of, heat, takes, place, in, three, ways, which, a, common, fire, place, very, well, illustrates, if, for, instance, we, place, a, thermometer, directly, before, a, fire, it, soon, begins, to, rise, indicating, an, increase, of, temperature, in, this, case, the, heat, has, made, its, way, through, the, space, between, the, fire, and, the, thermometer, by, the, process, termed, radiation, if, we, place, a, second, thermometer, in, contact, with, any, part, of, the, grate, and, away, from, the, direct, influence, of, the, fire, we, shall, find, that, this, thermometer, also, denotes, an, increase, of, temperature, but, here, the, heat, must, have, travelled, through, the, metal, of, the, grate, by, what, is, termed, conduction, lastly, a, third, thermometer, placed, in, the, chimney, away, from, the, direct, influence, of, the, fire, will, also, indicate, a, considerable, increase, of, temperature, in, this, case, a, portion, of, the, air, passing, through, and, near, the, fire, has, become, heated, and, has, carried, up, the, chimney, the, temperature, acquired, from, the, fire, there, is, at, present, no, single, term, in, our, language, employed, to, denote, this, third, mode, of, the, propagation, of, heat, but, we, venture, to, propose, for, that, purpose, the, term, convection, convectio, a, carrying, or, conveying, which, not, only, expresses, the, leading, fact, but, also, accords, very, well, with, the, two, other, terms, later, in, the, same, treatise, viii, in, the, book, on, meteorology, the, concept, of, convection, is, also, applied, to, the, process, by, which, heat, is, communicated, through, water, today, the, word, convection, has, different, but, related, usages, in, different, scientific, or, engineering, contexts, or, applications, in, fluid, mechanics, convection, has, a, broader, sense, it, refers, to, the, motion, of, fluid, driven, by, density, or, other, property, difference, in, thermodynamics, convection, often, refers, to, heat, transfer, by, convection, where, the, prefixed, variant, natural, convection, is, used, to, distinguish, the, fluid, mechanics, concept, of, convection, covered, in, this, article, from, convective, heat, transfer, some, phenomena, which, result, in, an, effect, superficially, similar, to, that, of, a, convective, cell, may, also, be, inaccurately, referred, to, as, a, form, of, convection, for, example, thermo, capillary, convection, and, granular, convection, convection, may, happen, in, fluids, at, all, scales, larger, than, a, few, atoms, there, are, a, variety, of, circumstances, in, which, the, forces, required, for, convection, arise, leading, to, different, types, of, convection, described, below, in, broad, terms, convection, arises, because, of, body, forces, acting, within, the, fluid, such, as, gravity, natural, convection, is, a, flow, whose, motion, is, caused, by, some, parts, of, a, fluid, being, heavier, than, other, parts, in, most, cases, this, leads, to, natural, circulation, the, ability, of, a, fluid, in, a, system, to, circulate, continuously, under, gravity, with, transfer, of, heat, energy, the, driving, force, for, natural, convection, is, gravity, in, a, column, of, fluid, pressure, increases, with, depth, from, the, weight, of, the, overlying, fluid, the, pressure, at, the, bottom, of, a, submerged, object, then, exceeds, that, at, the, top, resulting, in, a, net, upward, buoyancy, force, equal, to, the, weight, of, the, displaced, fluid, objects, of, higher, density, than, that, of, the, displaced, fluid, then, sink, for, example, regions, of, warmer, low, density, air, rise, while, those, of, colder, high, density, air, sink, this, creates, a, circulating, flow, convection, gravity, drives, natural, convection, without, gravity, convection, does, not, occur, so, there, is, no, convection, in, free, fall, inertial, environments, such, as, that, of, the, orbiting, international, space, station, natural, convection, can, occur, when, there, are, hot, and, cold, regions, of, either, air, or, water, because, both, water, and, air, become, less, dense, as, they, are, heated, but, for, example, in, the, world, s, oceans, it, also, occurs, due, to, salt, water, being, heavier, than, fresh, water, so, a, layer, of, salt, water, on, top, of, a, layer, of, fresher, water, will, also, cause, convection, natural, convection, has, attracted, a, great, deal, of, attention, from, researchers, because, of, its, presence, both, in, nature, and, engineering, applications, in, nature, convection, cells, formed, from, air, raising, above, sunlight, warmed, land, or, water, are, a, major, feature, of, all, weather, systems, convection, is, also, seen, in, the, rising, plume, of, hot, air, from, fire, plate, tectonics, oceanic, currents, thermohaline, circulation, and, sea, wind, formation, where, upward, convection, is, also, modified, by, coriolis, forces, in, engineering, applications, convection, is, commonly, visualized, in, the, formation, of, microstructures, during, the, cooling, of, molten, metals, and, fluid, flows, around, shrouded, heat, dissipation, fins, and, solar, ponds, a, very, common, industrial, application, of, natural, convection, is, free, air, cooling, without, the, aid, of, fans, this, can, happen, on, small, scales, computer, chips, to, large, scale, process, equipment, natural, convection, will, be, more, likely, and, more, rapid, with, a, greater, variation, in, density, between, the, two, fluids, a, larger, acceleration, due, to, gravity, that, drives, the, convection, or, a, larger, distance, through, the, convecting, medium, natural, convection, will, be, less, likely, and, less, rapid, with, more, rapid, diffusion, thereby, diffusing, away, the, thermal, gradient, that, is, causing, the, convection, or, a, more, viscous, sticky, fluid, the, onset, of, natural, convection, can, be, determined, by, the, rayleigh, number, ra, differences, in, buoyancy, within, a, fluid, can, arise, for, reasons, other, than, temperature, variations, in, which, case, the, fluid, motion, is, called, gravitational, convection, see, below, however, all, types, of, buoyant, convection, including, natural, convection, do, not, occur, in, microgravity, environments, all, require, the, presence, of, an, environment, which, experiences, g, force, proper, acceleration, the, difference, of, density, in, the, fluid, is, the, key, driving, mechanism, if, the, differences, of, density, are, caused, by, heat, this, force, is, called, as, thermal, head, or, thermal, driving, head, a, fluid, system, designed, for, natural, circulation, will, have, a, heat, source, and, a, heat, sink, each, of, these, is, in, contact, with, some, of, the, fluid, in, the, system, but, not, all, of, it, the, heat, source, is, positioned, lower, than, the, heat, sink, most, fluids, expand, when, heated, becoming, less, dense, and, contract, when, cooled, becoming, denser, at, the, heat, source, of, a, system, of, natural, circulation, the, heated, fluid, becomes, lighter, than, the, fluid, surrounding, it, and, thus, rises, at, the, heat, sink, the, nearby, fluid, becomes, denser, as, it, cools, and, is, drawn, downward, by, gravity, together, these, effects, create, a, flow, of, fluid, from, the, heat, source, to, the, heat, sink, and, back, again, gravitational, convection, is, a, type, of, natural, convection, induced, by, buoyancy, variations, resulting, from, material, properties, other, than, temperature, typically, this, is, caused, by, a, variable, composition, of, the, fluid, if, the, varying, property, is, a, concentration, gradient, it, is, known, as, solutal, convection, for, example, gravitational, convection, can, be, seen, in, the, diffusion, of, a, source, of, dry, salt, downward, into, wet, soil, due, to, the, buoyancy, of, fresh, water, in, saline, variable, salinity, in, water, and, variable, water, content, in, air, masses, are, frequent, causes, of, convection, in, the, oceans, and, atmosphere, which, do, not, involve, heat, or, else, involve, additional, compositional, density, factors, other, than, the, density, changes, from, thermal, expansion, see, thermohaline, circulation, similarly, variable, composition, within, the, earth, s, interior, which, has, not, yet, achieved, maximal, stability, and, minimal, energy, in, other, words, with, densest, parts, deepest, continues, to, cause, a, fraction, of, the, convection, of, fluid, rock, and, molten, metal, within, the, earth, s, interior, see, below, gravitational, convection, like, natural, thermal, convection, also, requires, a, g, force, environment, in, order, to, occur, ice, convection, on, pluto, is, believed, to, occur, in, a, soft, mixture, of, nitrogen, ice, and, carbon, monoxide, ice, it, has, also, been, proposed, for, europa, and, other, bodies, in, the, outer, solar, system, thermomagnetic, convection, can, occur, when, an, external, magnetic, field, is, imposed, on, a, ferrofluid, with, varying, magnetic, susceptibility, in, the, presence, of, a, temperature, gradient, this, results, in, a, nonuniform, magnetic, body, force, which, leads, to, fluid, movement, a, ferrofluid, is, a, liquid, which, becomes, strongly, magnetized, in, the, presence, of, a, magnetic, field, in, a, zero, gravity, environment, there, can, be, no, buoyancy, forces, and, thus, no, convection, possible, so, flames, in, many, circumstances, without, gravity, smother, in, their, own, waste, gases, thermal, expansion, and, chemical, reactions, resulting, in, expansion, and, contraction, gases, allows, for, ventilation, of, the, flame, as, waste, gases, are, displaced, by, cool, fresh, oxygen, rich, gas, moves, in, to, take, up, the, low, pressure, zones, created, when, flame, exhaust, water, condenses, systems, of, natural, circulation, include, tornadoes, and, other, weather, systems, ocean, currents, and, household, ventilation, some, solar, water, heaters, use, natural, circulation, the, gulf, stream, circulates, as, a, result, of, the, evaporation, of, water, in, this, process, the, water, increases, in, salinity, and, density, in, the, north, atlantic, ocean, the, water, becomes, so, dense, that, it, begins, to, sink, down, convection, occurs, on, a, large, scale, in, atmospheres, oceans, planetary, mantles, and, it, provides, the, mechanism, of, heat, transfer, for, a, large, fraction, of, the, outermost, interiors, of, the, sun, and, all, stars, fluid, movement, during, convection, may, be, invisibly, slow, or, it, may, be, obvious, and, rapid, as, in, a, hurricane, on, astronomical, scales, convection, of, gas, and, dust, is, thought, to, occur, in, the, accretion, disks, of, black, holes, at, speeds, which, may, closely, approach, that, of, light, thermal, convection, in, liquids, can, be, demonstrated, by, placing, a, heat, source, for, example, a, bunsen, burner, at, the, side, of, a, container, with, a, liquid, adding, a, dye, to, the, water, such, as, food, colouring, will, enable, visualisation, of, the, flow, another, common, experiment, to, demonstrate, thermal, convection, in, liquids, involves, submerging, open, containers, of, hot, and, cold, liquid, coloured, with, dye, into, a, large, container, of, the, same, liquid, without, dye, at, an, intermediate, temperature, for, example, a, jar, of, hot, tap, water, coloured, red, a, jar, of, water, chilled, in, a, fridge, coloured, blue, lowered, into, a, clear, tank, of, water, at, room, temperature, a, third, approach, is, to, use, two, identical, jars, one, filled, with, hot, water, dyed, one, colour, and, cold, water, of, another, colour, one, jar, is, then, temporarily, sealed, for, example, with, a, piece, of, card, inverted, and, placed, on, top, of, the, other, when, the, card, is, removed, if, the, jar, containing, the, warmer, liquid, is, placed, on, top, no, convection, will, occur, if, the, jar, containing, colder, liquid, is, placed, on, top, a, convection, current, will, form, spontaneously, convection, in, gases, can, be, demonstrated, using, a, candle, in, a, sealed, space, with, an, inlet, and, exhaust, port, the, heat, from, the, candle, will, cause, a, strong, convection, current, which, can, be, demonstrated, with, a, flow, indicator, such, as, smoke, from, another, candle, being, released, near, the, inlet, and, exhaust, areas, respectively, a, convection, cell, also, known, as, a, b, nard, cell, is, a, characteristic, fluid, flow, pattern, in, many, convection, systems, a, rising, body, of, fluid, typically, loses, heat, because, it, encounters, a, colder, surface, in, liquid, this, occurs, because, it, exchanges, heat, with, colder, liquid, through, direct, exchange, in, the, example, of, the, earth, s, atmosphere, this, occurs, because, it, radiates, heat, because, of, this, heat, loss, the, fluid, becomes, denser, than, the, fluid, underneath, it, which, is, still, rising, since, it, cannot, descend, through, the, rising, fluid, it, moves, to, one, side, at, some, distance, its, downward, force, overcomes, the, rising, force, beneath, it, and, the, fluid, begins, to, descend, as, it, descends, it, warms, again, and, the, cycle, repeats, itself, additionally, convection, cells, can, arise, due, to, density, variations, resulting, from, differences, in, the, composition, of, electrolytes, atmospheric, circulation, is, the, large, scale, movement, of, air, and, is, a, means, by, which, thermal, energy, is, distributed, on, the, surface, of, the, earth, together, with, the, much, slower, lagged, ocean, circulation, system, the, large, scale, structure, of, the, atmospheric, circulation, varies, from, year, to, year, but, the, basic, climatological, structure, remains, fairly, constant, latitudinal, circulation, occurs, because, incident, solar, radiation, per, unit, area, is, highest, at, the, heat, equator, and, decreases, as, the, latitude, increases, reaching, minima, at, the, poles, it, consists, of, two, primary, convection, cells, the, hadley, cell, and, the, polar, vortex, with, the, hadley, cell, experiencing, stronger, convection, due, to, the, release, of, latent, heat, energy, by, condensation, of, water, vapor, at, higher, altitudes, during, cloud, formation, longitudinal, circulation, on, the, other, hand, comes, about, because, the, ocean, has, a, higher, specific, heat, capacity, than, land, and, also, thermal, conductivity, allowing, the, heat, to, penetrate, further, beneath, the, surface, and, thereby, absorbs, and, releases, more, heat, but, the, temperature, changes, less, than, land, this, brings, the, sea, breeze, air, cooled, by, the, water, ashore, in, the, day, and, carries, the, land, breeze, air, cooled, by, contact, with, the, ground, out, to, sea, during, the, night, longitudinal, circulation, consists, of, two, cells, the, walker, circulation, and, el, ni, o, southern, oscillation, some, more, localized, phenomena, than, global, atmospheric, movement, are, also, due, to, convection, including, wind, and, some, of, the, hydrologic, cycle, for, example, a, foehn, wind, is, a, down, slope, wind, which, occurs, on, the, downwind, side, of, a, mountain, range, it, results, from, the, adiabatic, warming, of, air, which, has, dropped, most, of, its, moisture, on, windward, slopes, because, of, the, different, adiabatic, lapse, rates, of, moist, and, dry, air, the, air, on, the, leeward, slopes, becomes, warmer, than, at, the, same, height, on, the, windward, slopes, a, thermal, column, or, thermal, is, a, vertical, section, of, rising, air, in, the, lower, altitudes, of, the, earth, s, atmosphere, thermals, are, created, by, the, uneven, heating, of, the, earth, s, surface, from, solar, radiation, the, sun, warms, the, ground, which, in, turn, warms, the, air, directly, above, it, the, warmer, air, expands, becoming, less, dense, than, the, surrounding, air, mass, and, creating, a, thermal, low, the, mass, of, lighter, air, rises, and, as, it, does, it, cools, by, expansion, at, lower, air, pressures, it, stops, rising, when, it, has, cooled, to, the, same, temperature, as, the, surrounding, air, associated, with, a, thermal, is, a, downward, flow, surrounding, the, thermal, column, the, downward, moving, exterior, is, caused, by, colder, air, being, displaced, at, the, top, of, the, thermal, another, convection, driven, weather, effect, is, the, sea, breeze, warm, air, has, a, lower, density, than, cool, air, so, warm, air, rises, within, cooler, air, similar, to, hot, air, balloons, clouds, form, as, relatively, warmer, air, carrying, moisture, rises, within, cooler, air, as, the, moist, air, rises, it, cools, causing, some, of, the, water, vapor, in, the, rising, packet, of, air, to, condense, when, the, moisture, condenses, it, releases, energy, known, as, latent, heat, of, condensation, which, allows, the, rising, packet, of, air, to, cool, less, than, its, surrounding, air, continuing, the, cloud, s, ascension, if, enough, instability, is, present, in, the, atmosphere, this, process, will, continue, long, enough, for, cumulonimbus, clouds, to, form, which, support, lightning, and, thunder, generally, thunderstorms, require, three, conditions, to, form, moisture, an, unstable, airmass, and, a, lifting, force, heat, all, thunderstorms, regardless, of, type, go, through, three, stages, the, developing, stage, the, mature, stage, and, the, dissipation, stage, the, average, thunderstorm, has, a, 24, km, 15, mi, diameter, depending, on, the, conditions, present, in, the, atmosphere, these, three, stages, take, an, average, of, 30, minutes, to, go, through, solar, radiation, affects, the, oceans, warm, water, from, the, equator, tends, to, circulate, toward, the, poles, while, cold, polar, water, heads, towards, the, equator, the, surface, currents, are, initially, dictated, by, surface, wind, conditions, the, trade, winds, blow, westward, in, the, tropics, and, the, westerlies, blow, eastward, at, mid, latitudes, this, wind, pattern, applies, a, stress, to, the, subtropical, ocean, surface, with, negative, curl, across, the, northern, hemisphere, and, the, reverse, across, the, southern, hemisphere, the, resulting, sverdrup, transport, is, equatorward, because, of, conservation, of, potential, vorticity, caused, by, the, poleward, moving, winds, on, the, subtropical, ridge, s, western, periphery, and, the, increased, relative, vorticity, of, poleward, moving, water, transport, is, balanced, by, a, narrow, accelerating, poleward, current, which, flows, along, the, western, boundary, of, the, ocean, basin, outweighing, the, effects, of, friction, with, the, cold, western, boundary, current, which, originates, from, high, latitudes, the, overall, process, known, as, western, intensification, causes, currents, on, the, western, boundary, of, an, ocean, basin, to, be, stronger, than, those, on, the, eastern, boundary, as, it, travels, poleward, warm, water, transported, by, strong, warm, water, current, undergoes, evaporative, cooling, the, cooling, is, wind, driven, wind, moving, over, water, cools, the, water, and, also, causes, evaporation, leaving, a, saltier, brine, in, this, process, the, water, becomes, saltier, and, denser, and, decreases, in, temperature, once, sea, ice, forms, salts, are, left, out, of, the, ice, a, process, known, as, brine, exclusion, these, two, processes, produce, water, that, is, denser, and, colder, the, water, across, the, northern, atlantic, ocean, becomes, so, dense, that, it, begins, to, sink, down, through, less, salty, and, less, dense, water, this, open, ocean, convection, is, not, unlike, that, of, a, lava, lamp, this, downdraft, of, heavy, cold, and, dense, water, becomes, a, part, of, the, north, atlantic, deep, water, a, south, going, stream, mantle, convection, is, the, slow, creeping, motion, of, earth, s, rocky, mantle, caused, by, convection, currents, carrying, heat, from, the, interior, of, the, earth, to, the, surface, it, is, one, of, 3, driving, forces, that, causes, tectonic, plates, to, move, around, the, earth, s, surface, the, earth, s, surface, is, divided, into, a, number, of, tectonic, plates, that, are, continuously, being, created, and, consumed, at, their, opposite, plate, boundaries, creation, accretion, occurs, as, mantle, is, added, to, the, growing, edges, of, a, plate, this, hot, added, material, cools, down, by, conduction, and, convection, of, heat, at, the, consumption, edges, of, the, plate, the, material, has, thermally, contracted, to, become, dense, and, it, sinks, under, its, own, weight, in, the, process, of, subduction, at, an, ocean, trench, this, subducted, material, sinks, to, some, depth, in, the, earth, s, interior, where, it, is, prohibited, from, sinking, further, the, subducted, oceanic, crust, triggers, volcanism, convection, within, earth, s, mantle, is, the, driving, force, for, plate, tectonics, mantle, convection, is, the, result, of, a, thermal, gradient, the, lower, mantle, is, hotter, than, the, upper, mantle, and, is, therefore, less, dense, this, sets, up, two, primary, types, of, instabilities, in, the, first, type, plumes, rise, from, the, lower, mantle, and, corresponding, unstable, regions, of, lithosphere, drip, back, into, the, mantle, in, the, second, type, subducting, oceanic, plates, which, largely, constitute, the, upper, thermal, boundary, layer, of, the, mantle, plunge, back, into, the, mantle, and, move, downwards, towards, the, core, mantle, boundary, mantle, convection, occurs, at, rates, of, centimeters, per, year, and, it, takes, on, the, order, of, hundreds, of, millions, of, years, to, complete, a, cycle, of, convection, neutrino, flux, measurements, from, the, earth, s, core, see, kamland, show, the, source, of, about, two, thirds, of, the, heat, in, the, inner, core, is, the, radioactive, decay, of, 40, k, uranium, and, thorium, this, has, allowed, plate, tectonics, on, earth, to, continue, far, longer, than, it, would, have, if, it, were, simply, driven, by, heat, left, over, from, earth, s, formation, or, with, heat, produced, from, gravitational, potential, energy, as, a, result, of, physical, rearrangement, of, denser, portions, of, the, earth, s, interior, toward, the, center, of, the, planet, that, is, a, type, of, prolonged, falling, and, settling, the, stack, effect, or, chimney, effect, is, the, movement, of, air, into, and, out, of, buildings, chimneys, flue, gas, stacks, or, other, containers, due, to, buoyancy, buoyancy, occurs, due, to, a, difference, in, indoor, to, outdoor, air, density, resulting, from, temperature, and, moisture, differences, the, greater, the, thermal, difference, and, the, height, of, the, structure, the, greater, the, buoyancy, force, and, thus, the, stack, effect, the, stack, effect, helps, drive, natural, ventilation, and, infiltration, some, cooling, towers, operate, on, this, principle, similarly, the, solar, updraft, tower, is, a, proposed, device, to, generate, electricity, based, on, the, stack, effect, the, convection, zone, of, a, star, is, the, range, of, radii, in, which, energy, is, transported, outward, from, the, core, region, primarily, by, convection, rather, than, radiation, this, occurs, at, radii, which, are, sufficiently, opaque, that, convection, is, more, efficient, than, radiation, at, transporting, energy, granules, on, the, photosphere, of, the, sun, are, the, visible, tops, of, convection, cells, in, the, photosphere, caused, by, convection, of, plasma, in, the, photosphere, the, rising, part, of, the, granules, is, located, in, the, center, where, the, plasma, is, hotter, the, outer, edge, of, the, granules, is, darker, due, to, the, cooler, descending, plasma, a, typical, granule, has, a, diameter, on, the, order, of, 1, 000, kilometers, and, each, lasts, 8, to, 20, minutes, before, dissipating, below, the, photosphere, is, a, layer, of, much, larger, supergranules, up, to, 30, 000, kilometers, in, diameter, with, lifespans, of, up, to, 24, hours, water, is, a, fluid, that, does, not, obey, the, boussinesq, approximation, this, is, because, its, density, varies, nonlinearly, with, temperature, which, causes, its, thermal, expansion, coefficient, to, be, inconsistent, near, freezing, temperatures, the, density, of, water, reaches, a, maximum, at, 4, c, and, decreases, as, the, temperature, deviates, this, phenomenon, is, investigated, by, experiment, and, numerical, methods, water, is, initially, stagnant, at, 10, c, within, a, square, cavity, it, is, differentially, heated, between, the, two, vertical, walls, where, the, left, and, right, walls, are, held, at, 10, c, and, 0, c, respectively, the, density, anomaly, manifests, in, its, flow, pattern, as, the, water, is, cooled, at, the, right, wall, the, density, increases, which, accelerates, the, flow, downward, as, the, flow, develops, and, the, water, cools, further, the, decrease, in, density, causes, a, recirculation, current, at, the, bottom, right, corner, of, the, cavity, another, case, of, this, phenomenon, is, the, event, of, super, cooling, where, the, water, is, cooled, to, below, freezing, temperatures, but, does, not, immediately, begin, to, freeze, under, the, same, conditions, as, before, the, flow, is, developed, afterward, the, temperature, of, the, right, wall, is, decreased, to, 10, c, this, causes, the, water, at, that, wall, to, become, supercooled, create, a, counter, clockwise, flow, and, initially, overpower, the, warm, current, this, plume, is, caused, by, a, delay, in, the, nucleation, of, the, ice, once, ice, begins, to, form, the, flow, returns, to, a, similar, pattern, as, before, and, the, solidification, propagates, gradually, until, the, flow, is, redeveloped, in, a, nuclear, reactor, natural, circulation, can, be, a, design, criterion, it, is, achieved, by, reducing, turbulence, and, friction, in, the, fluid, flow, that, is, minimizing, head, loss, and, by, providing, a, way, to, remove, any, inoperative, pumps, from, the, fluid, path, also, the, reactor, as, the, heat, source, must, be, physically, lower, than, the, steam, generators, or, turbines, the, heat, sink, in, this, way, natural, circulation, will, ensure, that, the, fluid, will, continue, to, flow, as, long, as, the, reactor, is, hotter, than, the, heat, sink, even, when, power, cannot, be, supplied, to, the, pumps, notable, examples, are, the, s5g, and, s8g, united, states, naval, reactors, which, were, designed, to, operate, at, a, significant, fraction, of, full, power, under, natural, circulation, quieting, those, propulsion, plants, the, s6g, reactor, cannot, operate, at, power, under, natural, circulation, but, can, use, it, to, maintain, emergency, cooling, while, shut, down, by, the, nature, of, natural, circulation, fluids, do, not, typically, move, very, fast, but, this, is, not, necessarily, bad, as, high, flow, rates, are, not, essential, to, safe, and, effective, reactor, operation, in, modern, design, nuclear, reactors, flow, reversal, is, almost, impossible, all, nuclear, reactors, even, ones, designed, to, primarily, use, natural, circulation, as, the, main, method, of, fluid, circulation, have, pumps, that, can, circulate, the, fluid, in, the, case, that, natural, circulation, is, not, sufficient, a, number, of, dimensionless, terms, have, been, derived, to, describe, and, predict, convection, including, the, archimedes, number, grashof, number, richardson, number, and, the, rayleigh, number, in, cases, of, mixed, convection, natural, and, forced, occurring, together, one, would, often, like, to, know, how, much, of, the, convection, is, due, to, external, constraints, such, as, the, fluid, velocity, in, the, pump, and, how, much, is, due, to, natural, convection, occurring, in, the, system, the, relative, magnitudes, of, the, grashof, number, and, the, square, of, the, reynolds, number, determine, which, form, of, convection, dominates, if, g, r, r, e, 2, 1, displaystyle, rm, gr, re, 2, gg, 1, forced, convection, may, be, neglected, whereas, if, g, r, r, e, 2, 1, displaystyle, rm, gr, re, 2, ll, 1, natural, convection, may, be, neglected, if, the, ratio, known, as, the, richardson, number, is, approximately, one, then, both, forced, and, natural, convection, need, to, be, taken, into, account, the, onset, of, natural, convection, is, determined, by, the, rayleigh, number, ra, this, dimensionless, number, is, given, by, where, natural, convection, will, be, more, likely, and, or, more, rapid, with, a, greater, variation, in, density, between, the, two, fluids, a, larger, acceleration, due, to, gravity, that, drives, the, convection, and, or, a, larger, distance, through, the, convecting, medium, convection, will, be, less, likely, and, or, less, rapid, with, more, rapid, diffusion, thereby, diffusing, away, the, gradient, that, is, causing, the, convection, and, or, a, more, viscous, sticky, fluid, for, thermal, convection, due, to, heating, from, below, as, described, in, the, boiling, pot, above, the, equation, is, modified, for, thermal, expansion, and, thermal, diffusivity, density, variations, due, to, thermal, expansion, are, given, by, where, the, general, diffusivity, d, displaystyle, d, is, redefined, as, a, thermal, diffusivity, displaystyle, alpha, inserting, these, substitutions, produces, a, rayleigh, number, that, can, be, used, to, predict, thermal, convection, the, tendency, of, a, particular, naturally, convective, system, towards, turbulence, relies, on, the, grashof, number, gr, in, very, sticky, viscous, fluids, large, fluid, motion, is, restricted, and, natural, convection, will, be, non, turbulent, following, the, treatment, of, the, previous, subsection, the, typical, fluid, velocity, is, of, the, order, of, g, l, 2, displaystyle, g, delta, rho, l, 2, mu, up, to, a, numerical, factor, depending, on, the, geometry, of, the, system, therefore, grashof, number, can, be, thought, of, as, reynolds, number, with, the, velocity, of, natural, convection, replacing, the, velocity, in, reynolds, number, s, formula, however, in, practice, when, referring, to, the, reynolds, number, it, is, understood, that, one, is, considering, forced, convection, and, the, velocity, is, taken, as, the, velocity, dictated, by, external, constraints, see, below, the, grashof, number, can, be, formulated, for, natural, convection, occurring, due, to, a, concentration, gradient, sometimes, termed, thermo, solutal, convection, in, this, case, a, concentration, of, hot, fluid, diffuses, into, a, cold, fluid, in, much, the, same, way, that, ink, poured, into, a, container, of, water, diffuses, to, dye, the, entire, space, then, natural, convection, is, highly, dependent, on, the, geometry, of, the, hot, surface, various, correlations, exist, in, order, to, determine, the, heat, transfer, coefficient, a, general, correlation, that, applies, for, a, variety, of, geometries, is, the, value, of, f, 4, pr, is, calculated, using, the, following, formula, nu, is, the, nusselt, number, and, the, values, of, nu, 0, and, the, characteristic, length, used, to, calculate, re, are, listed, below, see, also, discussion, warning, the, values, indicated, for, the, horizontal, cylinder, are, wrong, see, discussion, one, example, of, natural, convection, is, heat, transfer, from, an, isothermal, vertical, plate, immersed, in, a, fluid, causing, the, fluid, to, move, parallel, to, the, plate, this, will, occur, in, any, system, wherein, the, density, of, the, moving, fluid, varies, with, position, these, phenomena, will, only, be, of, significance, when, the, moving, fluid, is, minimally, affected, by, forced, convection, when, considering, the, flow, of, fluid, is, a, result, of, heating, the, following, correlations, can, be, used, assuming, the, fluid, is, an, ideal, diatomic, has, adjacent, to, a, vertical, plate, at, constant, temperature, and, the, flow, of, the, fluid, is, completely, laminar, nu, m, 0, 478, gr, 0, 25, mean, nusselt, number, nu, m, h, m, l, k, where, grashof, number, gr, g, l, 3, t, s, t, v, 2, t, displaystyle, v, 2, t, where, when, the, flow, is, turbulent, different, correlations, involving, the, rayleigh, number, a, function, of, both, the, grashof, number, and, the, prandtl, number, must, be, used, note, that, the, above, equation, differs, from, the, usual, expression, for, grashof, number, because, the, value, displaystyle, beta, has, been, replaced, by, its, approximation, 1, t, displaystyle, 1, t, which, applies, for, ideal, gases, only, a, reasonable, approximation, for, air, at, ambient, pressure, convection, especially, rayleigh, b, nard, convection, where, the, convecting, fluid, is, contained, by, two, rigid, horizontal, plates, is, a, convenient, example, of, a, pattern, forming, system, when, heat, is, fed, into, the, system, from, one, direction, usually, below, at, small, values, it, merely, diffuses, conducts, from, below, upward, without, causing, fluid, flow, as, the, heat, flow, is, increased, above, a, critical, value, of, the, rayleigh, number, the, system, undergoes, a, bifurcation, from, the, stable, conducting, state, to, the, convecting, state, where, bulk, motion, of, the, fluid, due, to, heat, begins, if, fluid, parameters, other, than, density, do, not, depend, significantly, on, temperature, the, flow, profile, is, symmetric, with, the, same, volume, of, fluid, rising, as, falling, this, is, known, as, boussinesq, convection, as, the, temperature, difference, between, the, top, and, bottom, of, the, fluid, becomes, higher, significant, differences, in, fluid, parameters, other, than, density, may, develop, in, the, fluid, due, to, temperature, an, example, of, such, a, parameter, is, viscosity, which, may, begin, to, significantly, vary, horizontally, across, layers, of, fluid, this, breaks, the, symmetry, of, the, system, and, generally, changes, the, pattern, of, up, and, down, moving, fluid, from, stripes, to, hexagons, as, seen, at, right, such, hexagons, are, one, example, of, a, convection, cell, as, the, rayleigh, number, is, increased, even, further, above, the, value, where, convection, cells, first, appear, the, system, may, undergo, other, bifurcations, and, other, more, complex, patterns, such, as, spirals, may, begin, to, appear
