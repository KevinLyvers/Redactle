in, optics, the, refractive, index, or, refraction, index, of, an, optical, medium, is, a, dimensionless, number, that, gives, the, indication, of, the, light, bending, ability, of, that, medium, the, refractive, index, determines, how, much, the, path, of, light, is, bent, or, refracted, when, entering, a, material, this, is, described, by, snell, s, law, of, refraction, n, 1, sin, 1, n, 2, sin, 2, where, 1, and, 2, are, the, angle, of, incidence, and, angle, of, refraction, respectively, of, a, ray, crossing, the, interface, between, two, media, with, refractive, indices, n, 1, and, n, 2, the, refractive, indices, also, determine, the, amount, of, light, that, is, reflected, when, reaching, the, interface, as, well, as, the, critical, angle, for, total, internal, reflection, their, intensity, fresnel, equations, and, brewster, s, angle, the, refractive, index, n, displaystyle, n, can, be, seen, as, the, factor, by, which, the, speed, and, the, wavelength, of, the, radiation, are, reduced, with, respect, to, their, vacuum, values, the, speed, of, light, in, a, medium, is, v, c, n, and, similarly, the, wavelength, in, that, medium, is, 0, n, where, 0, is, the, wavelength, of, that, light, in, vacuum, this, implies, that, vacuum, has, a, refractive, index, of, 1, and, assumes, that, the, frequency, f, v, of, the, wave, is, not, affected, by, the, refractive, index, the, refractive, index, may, vary, with, wavelength, this, causes, white, light, to, split, into, constituent, colors, when, refracted, this, is, called, dispersion, this, effect, can, be, observed, in, prisms, and, rainbows, and, as, chromatic, aberration, in, lenses, light, propagation, in, absorbing, materials, can, be, described, using, a, complex, valued, refractive, index, the, imaginary, part, then, handles, the, attenuation, while, the, real, part, accounts, for, refraction, for, most, materials, the, refractive, index, changes, with, wavelength, by, several, percent, across, the, visible, spectrum, consequently, refractive, indices, for, materials, reported, using, a, single, value, for, n, must, specify, the, wavelength, used, in, the, measurement, the, concept, of, refractive, index, applies, across, the, full, electromagnetic, spectrum, from, x, rays, to, radio, waves, it, can, also, be, applied, to, wave, phenomena, such, as, sound, in, this, case, the, speed, of, sound, is, used, instead, of, that, of, light, and, a, reference, medium, other, than, vacuum, must, be, chosen, for, lenses, such, as, eye, glasses, a, lens, made, from, a, high, refractive, index, material, will, be, thinner, and, hence, lighter, than, a, conventional, lens, with, a, lower, refractive, index, such, lenses, are, generally, more, expensive, to, manufacture, than, conventional, ones, the, relative, refractive, index, of, an, optical, medium, 2, with, respect, to, another, reference, medium, 1, n, 21, is, given, by, the, ratio, of, speed, of, light, in, medium, 1, to, that, in, medium, 2, this, can, be, expressed, as, follows, n, 21, v, 1, v, 2, displaystyle, n, 21, frac, v, 1, v, 2, if, the, reference, medium, 1, is, vacuum, then, the, refractive, index, of, medium, 2, is, considered, with, respect, to, vacuum, it, is, simply, represented, as, n, 2, and, is, called, the, absolute, refractive, index, of, medium, 2, the, absolute, refractive, index, n, of, an, optical, medium, is, defined, as, the, ratio, of, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, c, 299, 792, 458, m, s, and, the, phase, velocity, v, of, light, in, the, medium, n, c, v, displaystyle, n, frac, mathrm, c, v, since, c, is, constant, n, is, inversely, proportional, to, v, n, 1, v, displaystyle, n, propto, frac, 1, v, the, phase, velocity, is, the, speed, at, which, the, crests, or, the, phase, of, the, wave, moves, which, may, be, different, from, the, group, velocity, the, speed, at, which, the, pulse, of, light, or, the, envelope, of, the, wave, moves, historically, air, at, a, standardized, pressure, and, temperature, has, been, common, as, a, reference, medium, thomas, young, was, presumably, the, person, who, first, used, and, invented, the, name, index, of, refraction, in, 1807, at, the, same, time, he, changed, this, value, of, refractive, power, into, a, single, number, instead, of, the, traditional, ratio, of, two, numbers, the, ratio, had, the, disadvantage, of, different, appearances, newton, who, called, it, the, proportion, of, the, sines, of, incidence, and, refraction, wrote, it, as, a, ratio, of, two, numbers, like, 529, to, 396, or, nearly, 4, to, 3, for, water, hauksbee, who, called, it, the, ratio, of, refraction, wrote, it, as, a, ratio, with, a, fixed, numerator, like, 10000, to, 7451, 9, for, urine, hutton, wrote, it, as, a, ratio, with, a, fixed, denominator, like, 1, 3358, to, 1, water, young, did, not, use, a, symbol, for, the, index, of, refraction, in, 1807, in, the, later, years, others, started, using, different, symbols, n, m, and, the, symbol, n, gradually, prevailed, refractive, index, also, varies, with, wavelength, of, the, light, as, given, by, cauchy, s, equation, the, most, general, form, of, this, equation, is, n, a, b, 2, c, 4, displaystyle, n, lambda, a, frac, b, lambda, 2, frac, c, lambda, 4, cdots, where, n, is, the, refractive, index, is, the, wavelength, and, a, b, c, etc, are, coefficients, that, can, be, determined, for, a, material, by, fitting, the, equation, to, measured, refractive, indices, at, known, wavelengths, the, coefficients, are, usually, quoted, for, as, the, vacuum, wavelength, in, micrometres, usually, it, is, sufficient, to, use, a, two, term, form, of, the, equation, n, a, b, 2, displaystyle, n, lambda, a, frac, b, lambda, 2, where, the, coefficients, a, and, b, are, determined, specifically, for, this, form, of, the, equation, for, visible, light, most, transparent, media, have, refractive, indices, between, 1, and, 2, a, few, examples, are, given, in, the, adjacent, table, these, values, are, measured, at, the, yellow, doublet, d, line, of, sodium, with, a, wavelength, of, 589, nanometers, as, is, conventionally, done, gases, at, atmospheric, pressure, have, refractive, indices, close, to, 1, because, of, their, low, density, almost, all, solids, and, liquids, have, refractive, indices, above, 1, 3, with, aerogel, as, the, clear, exception, aerogel, is, a, very, low, density, solid, that, can, be, produced, with, refractive, index, in, the, range, from, 1, 002, to, 1, 265, moissanite, lies, at, the, other, end, of, the, range, with, a, refractive, index, as, high, as, 2, 65, most, plastics, have, refractive, indices, in, the, range, from, 1, 3, to, 1, 7, but, some, high, refractive, index, polymers, can, have, values, as, high, as, 1, 76, for, infrared, light, refractive, indices, can, be, considerably, higher, germanium, is, transparent, in, the, wavelength, region, from, 2, to, 14, m, and, has, a, refractive, index, of, about, 4, a, type, of, new, materials, termed, topological, insulators, was, recently, found, which, have, high, refractive, index, of, up, to, 6, in, the, near, to, mid, infrared, frequency, range, moreover, topological, insulators, are, transparent, when, they, have, nanoscale, thickness, these, properties, are, potentially, important, for, applications, in, infrared, optics, according, to, the, theory, of, relativity, no, information, can, travel, faster, than, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, but, this, does, not, mean, that, the, refractive, index, cannot, be, less, than, 1, the, refractive, index, measures, the, phase, velocity, of, light, which, does, not, carry, information, the, phase, velocity, is, the, speed, at, which, the, crests, of, the, wave, move, and, can, be, faster, than, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, and, thereby, give, a, refractive, index, below, 1, this, can, occur, close, to, resonance, frequencies, for, absorbing, media, in, plasmas, and, for, x, rays, in, the, x, ray, regime, the, refractive, indices, are, lower, than, but, very, close, to, 1, exceptions, close, to, some, resonance, frequencies, as, an, example, water, has, a, refractive, index, of, 0, 999, 999, 74, 1, 2, 6, 10, 7, for, x, ray, radiation, at, a, photon, energy, of, 30, kev, 0, 04, nm, wavelength, an, example, of, a, plasma, with, an, index, of, refraction, less, than, unity, is, earth, s, ionosphere, since, the, refractive, index, of, the, ionosphere, a, plasma, is, less, than, unity, electromagnetic, waves, propagating, through, the, plasma, are, bent, away, from, the, normal, see, geometric, optics, allowing, the, radio, wave, to, be, refracted, back, toward, earth, thus, enabling, long, distance, radio, communications, see, also, radio, propagation, and, skywave, recent, research, has, also, demonstrated, the, existence, of, materials, with, a, negative, refractive, index, which, can, occur, if, permittivity, and, permeability, have, simultaneous, negative, values, this, can, be, achieved, with, periodically, constructed, metamaterials, the, resulting, negative, refraction, i, e, a, reversal, of, snell, s, law, offers, the, possibility, of, the, superlens, and, other, new, phenomena, to, be, actively, developed, by, means, of, metamaterials, at, the, atomic, scale, an, electromagnetic, wave, s, phase, velocity, is, slowed, in, a, material, because, the, electric, field, creates, a, disturbance, in, the, charges, of, each, atom, primarily, the, electrons, proportional, to, the, electric, susceptibility, of, the, medium, similarly, the, magnetic, field, creates, a, disturbance, proportional, to, the, magnetic, susceptibility, as, the, electromagnetic, fields, oscillate, in, the, wave, the, charges, in, the, material, will, be, shaken, back, and, forth, at, the, same, frequency, 67, the, charges, thus, radiate, their, own, electromagnetic, wave, that, is, at, the, same, frequency, but, usually, with, a, phase, delay, as, the, charges, may, move, out, of, phase, with, the, force, driving, them, see, sinusoidally, driven, harmonic, oscillator, the, light, wave, traveling, in, the, medium, is, the, macroscopic, superposition, sum, of, all, such, contributions, in, the, material, the, original, wave, plus, the, waves, radiated, by, all, the, moving, charges, this, wave, is, typically, a, wave, with, the, same, frequency, but, shorter, wavelength, than, the, original, leading, to, a, slowing, of, the, wave, s, phase, velocity, most, of, the, radiation, from, oscillating, material, charges, will, modify, the, incoming, wave, changing, its, velocity, however, some, net, energy, will, be, radiated, in, other, directions, or, even, at, other, frequencies, see, scattering, depending, on, the, relative, phase, of, the, original, driving, wave, and, the, waves, radiated, by, the, charge, motion, there, are, several, possibilities, for, most, materials, at, visible, light, frequencies, the, phase, is, somewhere, between, 90, and, 180, corresponding, to, a, combination, of, both, refraction, and, absorption, the, refractive, index, of, materials, varies, with, the, wavelength, and, frequency, of, light, this, is, called, dispersion, and, causes, prisms, and, rainbows, to, divide, white, light, into, its, constituent, spectral, colors, as, the, refractive, index, varies, with, wavelength, so, will, the, refraction, angle, as, light, goes, from, one, material, to, another, dispersion, also, causes, the, focal, length, of, lenses, to, be, wavelength, dependent, this, is, a, type, of, chromatic, aberration, which, often, needs, to, be, corrected, for, in, imaging, systems, in, regions, of, the, spectrum, where, the, material, does, not, absorb, light, the, refractive, index, tends, to, decrease, with, increasing, wavelength, and, thus, increase, with, frequency, this, is, called, normal, dispersion, in, contrast, to, anomalous, dispersion, where, the, refractive, index, increases, with, wavelength, for, visible, light, normal, dispersion, means, that, the, refractive, index, is, higher, for, blue, light, than, for, red, for, optics, in, the, visual, range, the, amount, of, dispersion, of, a, lens, material, is, often, quantified, by, the, abbe, number, v, n, y, e, l, l, o, w, 1, n, b, l, u, e, n, r, e, d, displaystyle, v, frac, n, mathrm, yellow, 1, n, mathrm, blue, n, mathrm, red, for, a, more, accurate, description, of, the, wavelength, dependence, of, the, refractive, index, the, sellmeier, equation, can, be, used, it, is, an, empirical, formula, that, works, well, in, describing, dispersion, sellmeier, coefficients, are, often, quoted, instead, of, the, refractive, index, in, tables, because, of, dispersion, it, is, usually, important, to, specify, the, vacuum, wavelength, of, light, for, which, a, refractive, index, is, measured, typically, measurements, are, done, at, various, well, defined, spectral, emission, lines, manufacturers, of, optical, glass, in, general, define, principal, index, of, refraction, at, yellow, spectral, line, of, helium, 587, 56, nm, and, alternatively, at, a, green, spectral, line, of, mercury, 546, 07, nm, called, d, and, e, lines, respectively, abbe, number, is, defined, for, both, and, denoted, v, d, and, v, e, the, spectral, data, provided, by, glass, manufacturers, is, also, often, more, precise, for, these, two, wavelengths, both, d, and, e, spectral, lines, are, singlets, and, thus, are, suitable, to, perform, a, very, precise, measurements, such, as, spectral, goniometric, method, in, practical, applications, measurements, of, refractive, index, are, performed, on, various, refractometers, such, as, abbe, refractometer, measurement, accuracy, of, such, typical, commercial, devices, is, in, the, order, of, 0, 0002, refractometers, usually, measure, refractive, index, n, d, defined, for, sodium, doublet, d, 589, 29, nm, which, is, actually, a, midpoint, between, two, adjacent, yellow, spectral, lines, of, sodium, yellow, spectral, lines, of, helium, d, and, sodium, d, are, 1, 73, nm, apart, which, can, be, considered, negligible, for, typical, refractometers, but, can, cause, confusion, and, lead, to, errors, if, accuracy, is, critical, all, three, typical, principle, refractive, indices, definitions, can, be, found, depending, on, application, and, region, so, a, proper, subscript, should, be, used, to, avoid, ambiguity, when, light, passes, through, a, medium, some, part, of, it, will, always, be, absorbed, this, can, be, conveniently, taken, into, account, by, defining, a, complex, refractive, index, n, n, i, displaystyle, underline, n, n, i, kappa, here, the, real, part, n, is, the, refractive, index, and, indicates, the, phase, velocity, while, the, imaginary, part, is, called, the, extinction, coefficient, 36, indicates, the, amount, of, attenuation, when, the, electromagnetic, wave, propagates, through, the, material, 128, it, is, related, to, the, absorption, coefficient, abs, displaystyle, alpha, text, abs, through, 41, abs, 2, c, displaystyle, alpha, text, abs, omega, frac, 2, omega, kappa, omega, c, these, values, depend, upon, the, frequency, of, the, light, used, in, the, measurement, that, corresponds, to, absorption, can, be, seen, by, inserting, this, refractive, index, into, the, expression, for, electric, field, of, a, plane, electromagnetic, wave, traveling, in, the, x, direction, this, can, be, done, by, relating, the, complex, wave, number, k, to, the, complex, refractive, index, n, through, k, 2, n, 0, with, 0, being, the, vacuum, wavelength, this, can, be, inserted, into, the, plane, wave, expression, for, a, wave, travelling, in, the, x, direction, as, e, x, t, re, e, 0, e, i, k, x, t, re, e, 0,

re, left, end, aligned, here, we, see, that, gives, an, exponential, decay, as, expected, from, the, beer, lambert, law, since, intensity, is, proportional, to, the, square, of, the, electric, field, intensity, will, depend, on, the, depth, into, the, material, as, i, x, i, 0, e, 4, x, 0, displaystyle, i, x, i, 0, e, 4, pi, kappa, x, lambda, 0, and, thus, the, absorption, coefficient, is, 4, 0, 128, and, the, penetration, depth, the, distance, after, which, the, intensity, is, reduced, by, a, factor, of, 1, e, is, p, 1, 0, 4, both, n, and, are, dependent, on, the, frequency, in, most, circumstances, 0, light, is, absorbed, or, 0, light, travels, forever, without, loss, in, special, situations, especially, in, the, gain, medium, of, lasers, it, is, also, possible, that, 0, corresponding, to, an, amplification, of, the, light, an, alternative, convention, uses, n, n, i, instead, of, n, n, i, but, where, 0, still, corresponds, to, loss, therefore, these, two, conventions, are, inconsistent, and, should, not, be, confused, the, difference, is, related, to, defining, sinusoidal, time, dependence, as, re, versus, re, see, mathematical, descriptions, of, opacity, dielectric, loss, and, non, zero, dc, conductivity, in, materials, cause, absorption, good, dielectric, materials, such, as, glass, have, extremely, low, dc, conductivity, and, at, low, frequencies, the, dielectric, loss, is, also, negligible, resulting, in, almost, no, absorption, however, at, higher, frequencies, such, as, visible, light, dielectric, loss, may, increase, absorption, significantly, reducing, the, material, s, transparency, to, these, frequencies, the, real, n, and, imaginary, parts, of, the, complex, refractive, index, are, related, through, the, kramers, kronig, relations, in, 1986, a, r, forouhi, and, i, bloomer, deduced, an, equation, describing, as, a, function, of, photon, energy, e, applicable, to, amorphous, materials, forouhi, and, bloomer, then, applied, the, kramers, kronig, relation, to, derive, the, corresponding, equation, for, n, as, a, function, of, e, the, same, formalism, was, applied, to, crystalline, materials, by, forouhi, and, bloomer, in, 1988, the, refractive, index, and, extinction, coefficient, n, and, are, typically, measured, from, quantities, that, depend, on, them, such, as, reflectance, r, or, transmittance, t, or, ellipsometric, parameters, and, the, determination, of, n, and, from, such, measured, quantities, will, involve, developing, a, theoretical, expression, for, r, or, t, or, and, in, terms, of, a, valid, physical, model, for, n, and, by, fitting, the, theoretical, model, to, the, measured, r, or, t, or, and, using, regression, analysis, n, and, can, be, deduced, for, x, ray, and, extreme, ultraviolet, radiation, the, complex, refractive, index, deviates, only, slightly, from, unity, and, usually, has, a, real, part, smaller, than, 1, it, is, therefore, normally, written, as, n, 1, i, or, n, 1, i, with, the, alternative, convention, mentioned, above, far, above, the, atomic, resonance, frequency, delta, can, be, given, by, r, 0, 2, n, e, 2, displaystyle, delta, frac, r, 0, lambda, 2, n, mathrm, e, 2, pi, where, r, 0, is, the, classical, electron, radius, is, the, x, ray, wavelength, and, n, e, is, the, electron, density, one, may, assume, the, electron, density, is, simply, the, number, of, electrons, per, atom, z, multiplied, by, the, atomic, density, but, more, accurate, calculation, of, the, refractive, index, requires, replacing, z, with, the, complex, atomic, form, factor, f, z, f, i, f, displaystyle, f, z, f, if, it, follows, that, r, 0, 2, 2, z, f, n, atom, r, 0, 2, 2, f, n, atom, displaystyle, begin, aligned, delta, frac, r, 0, lambda, 2, 2, pi, z, f, n,

geometric, length, d, of, the, path, light, follows, through, a, system, and, the, index, of, refraction, of, the, medium, through, which, it, propagates, opl, n, d, text, opl, nd, this, is, an, important, concept, in, optics, because, it, determines, the, phase, of, the, light, and, governs, interference, and, diffraction, of, light, as, it, propagates, according, to, fermat, s, principle, light, rays, can, be, characterized, as, those, curves, that, optimize, the, optical, path, length, 68, 69, when, light, moves, from, one, medium, to, another, it, changes, direction, i, e, it, is, refracted, if, it, moves, from, a, medium, with, refractive, index, n, 1, to, one, with, refractive, index, n, 2, with, an, incidence, angle, to, the, surface, normal, of, 1, the, refraction, angle,

angle, of, refraction, will, be, smaller, than, the, angle, of, incidence, and, the, light, will, be, refracted, towards, the, normal, of, the, surface, the, higher, the, refractive, index, the, closer, to, the, normal, direction, the, light, will, travel, when, passing, into, a, medium, with, lower, refractive, index, the, light, will, instead, be, refracted, away, from, the, normal,

the, reflectivity, of, the, surface, the, reflectivity, can, be, calculated, from, the, refractive, index, and, the, incidence, angle, with, the, fresnel, equations, which, for, normal, incidence,

general, it, is, assumed, that, the, refractive, index, of, a, glass, increases, with, its, density, however, there, does, not, exist, an, overall, linear, relationship, between, the, refractive, index, and, the, density, for, all, silicate, and, borosilicate, glasses, a, relatively, high, refractive, index, and, low, density, can, be, obtained, with, glasses, containing, light, metal, oxides, such, as, li, 2, o, and, mgo, while, the, opposite, trend, is, observed, with, glasses, containing, pbo, and, bao, as, seen, in, the, diagram, at, the, right, many, oils, such, as, olive, oil, and, ethanol, are, examples, of, liquids, that, are, more, refractive, but, less, dense, than, water, contrary, to, the, general, correlation, between, density, and, refractive, index, for, air, n, 1, is, proportional, to, the, density, of, the, gas, as, long, as, the, chemical, composition, does, not, change, this, means, that, it, is, also, proportional, to, the, pressure, and, inversely, proportional, to, the, temperature, for, ideal, gases, for, liquids, the, same, observation, can, be, made, as, for, gases, for, instance, the, refractive, index, in, alkanes, increases, nearly, perfectly, linear, with, the, density, on, the, other, hand, for, carboxylic, acids, the, density, decreases, with, increasing, number, of, c, atoms, within, the, homologeous, series, the, simple, explanation, of, this, finding, is, that, it, is, not, density, but, the, molar, concentration, of, the, chromophore, that, counts, in, homologeous, series, this, is, the, excitation, of, the, c, h, bonding, august, beer, must, have, intuitively, known, that, when, he, gave, hans, h, landolt, in, 1862, the, tip, to, investigate, the, refractive, index, of, compounds, of, homologeous, series, while, landolt, did, not, find, this, relationship, since, at, this, time, dispersion, theory, was, in, its, infancy, he, had, the, idea, of, molar, refractivity, which, can, even, be, assigned, to, single, atoms, based, on, this, concept, the, refractive, indices, of, organic, materials, can, be, calculated, sometimes, a, group, velocity, refractive, index, usually, called, the, group, index, is, defined, n, g, c, v, g, displaystyle, n, mathrm, g, frac, mathrm, c, v, mathrm, g, where, v, g, is, the, group, velocity, this, value, should, not, be, confused, with, n, which, is, always, defined, with, respect, to, the, phase, velocity, when, the, dispersion, is, small, the, group, velocity, can, be, linked, to, the, phase, velocity, by, the, relation, 22, v, g, v, d, v, d, displaystyle, v, mathrm, g, v, lambda, frac, mathrm, d, v, mathrm, d, lambda, where, is, the, wavelength, in, the, medium, in, this, case, the, group, index, can, thus, be, written, in, terms, of, the, wavelength, dependence, of, the, refractive, index, as, n, g, n, 1, n, d, n, d, displaystyle, n, mathrm, g, frac, n, 1, frac, lambda, n, frac, mathrm, d, n, mathrm, d, lambda, when, the, refractive, index, of, a, medium, is, known, as, a, function, of, the, vacuum, wavelength, instead, of, the, wavelength, in, the, medium, the, corresponding, expressions, for, the, group, velocity, and, index, are, for, all, values, of, dispersion, v, g, c, n, 0, d, n, d, 0, 1, n, g, n, 0, d, n, d, 0, displaystyle, begin, aligned, v, mathrm, g, mathrm, c, left, n, lambda, 0, frac, mathrm, d, n,

end, aligned, the, momentum, of, photons, in, a, medium, of, refractive, index, n, is, a, complex, and, controversial, issue, with, two, different, values, having, different, physical, interpretations, the, refractive, index, of, a, substance, can, be, related, to, its, polarizability, with, the, lorentz, lorenz, equation, or, to, the, molar, refractivities, of, its, constituents, by, the, gladstone, dale, relation, in, atmospheric, applications, refractivity, is, defined, as, n, n, 1, often, rescaled, as, either, n, 10, 6, n, 1, or, n, 10, 8, n, 1, the, multiplication, factors, are, used, because, the, refractive, index, for, air, n, deviates, from, unity, by, at, most, a, few, parts, per, ten, thousand, molar, refractivity, on, the, other, hand, is, a, measure, of, the, total, polarizability, of, a, mole, of, a, substance, and, can, be, calculated, from, the, refractive, index, as, a, m, n, 2, 1, n, 2, 2, displaystyle, a, frac, m, rho, cdot, frac, n, 2, 1, n, 2, 2, where, is, the, density, and, m, is, the, molar, mass, 93, so, far, we, have, assumed, that, refraction, is, given, by, linear, equations, involving, a, spatially, constant, scalar, refractive, index, these, assumptions, can, break, down, in, different, ways, to, be, described, in, the, following, subsections, in, some, materials, the, refractive, index, depends, on, the, polarization, and, propagation, direction, of, the, light, this, is, called, birefringence, or, optical, anisotropy, in, the, simplest, form, uniaxial, birefringence, there, is, only, one, special, direction, in, the, material, this, axis, is, known, as, the, optical, axis, of, the, material, 230, light, with, linear, polarization, perpendicular, to, this, axis, will, experience, an, ordinary, refractive, index, n, o, while, light, polarized, in, parallel, will, experience, an, extraordinary, refractive, index, n, e, 236, the, birefringence, of, the, material, is, the, difference, between, these, indices, of, refraction, n, n, e, n, o, 237, light, propagating, in, the, direction, of, the, optical, axis, will, not, be, affected, by, the, birefringence, since, the, refractive, index, will, be, n, o, independent, of, polarization, for, other, propagation, directions, the, light, will, split, into, two, linearly, polarized, beams, for, light, traveling, perpendicularly, to, the, optical, axis, the, beams, will, have, the, same, direction, 233, this, can, be, used, to, change, the, polarization, direction, of, linearly, polarized, light, or, to, convert, between, linear, circular, and, elliptical, polarizations, with, waveplates, 237, many, crystals, are, naturally, birefringent, but, isotropic, materials, such, as, plastics, and, glass, can, also, often, be, made, birefringent, by, introducing, a, preferred, direction, through, e, g, an, external, force, or, electric, field, this, effect, is, called, photoelasticity, and, can, be, used, to, reveal, stresses, in, structures, the, birefringent, material, is, placed, between, crossed, polarizers, a, change, in, birefringence, alters, the, polarization, and, thereby, the, fraction, of, light, that, is, transmitted, through, the, second, polarizer, in, the, more, general, case, of, trirefringent, materials, described, by, the, field, of, crystal, optics, the, dielectric, constant, is, a, rank, 2, tensor, a, 3, by, 3, matrix, in, this, case, the, propagation, of, light, cannot, simply, be, described, by, refractive, indices, except, for, polarizations, along, principal, axes, the, strong, electric, field, of, high, intensity, light, such, as, the, output, of, a, laser, may, cause, a, medium, s, refractive, index, to, vary, as, the, light, passes, through, it, giving, rise, to, nonlinear, optics, 502, if, the, index, varies, quadratically, with, the, field, linearly, with, the, intensity, it, is, called, the, optical, kerr, effect, and, causes, phenomena, such, as, self, focusing, and, self, phase, modulation, 264, if, the, index, varies, linearly, with, the, field, a, nontrivial, linear, coefficient, is, only, possible, in, materials, that, do, not, possess, inversion, symmetry, it, is, known, as, the, pockels, effect, 265, if, the, refractive, index, of, a, medium, is, not, constant, but, varies, gradually, with, the, position, the, material, is, known, as, a, gradient, index, grin, medium, and, is, described, by, gradient, index, optics, 273, light, traveling, through, such, a, medium, can, be, bent, or, focused, and, this, effect, can, be, exploited, to, produce, lenses, some, optical, fibers, and, other, devices, introducing, grin, elements, in, the, design, of, an, optical, system, can, greatly, simplify, the, system, reducing, the, number, of, elements, by, as, much, as, a, third, while, maintaining, overall, performance, 276, the, crystalline, lens, of, the, human, eye, is, an, example, of, a, grin, lens, with, a, refractive, index, varying, from, about, 1, 406, in, the, inner, core, to, approximately, 1, 386, at, the, less, dense, cortex, 203, some, common, mirages, are, caused, by, a, spatially, varying, refractive, index, of, air, the, refractive, index, of, liquids, or, solids, can, be, measured, with, refractometers, they, typically, measure, some, angle, of, refraction, or, the, critical, angle, for, total, internal, reflection, the, first, laboratory, refractometers, sold, commercially, were, developed, by, ernst, abbe, in, the, late, 19th, century, the, same, principles, are, still, used, today, in, this, instrument, a, thin, layer, of, the, liquid, to, be, measured, is, placed, between, two, prisms, light, is, shone, through, the, liquid, at, incidence, angles, all, the, way, up, to, 90, i, e, light, rays, parallel, to, the, surface, the, second, prism, should, have, an, index, of, refraction, higher, than, that, of, the, liquid, so, that, light, only, enters, the, prism, at, angles, smaller, than, the, critical, angle, for, total, reflection, this, angle, can, then, be, measured, either, by, looking, through, a, telescope, or, with, a, digital, photodetector, placed, in, the, focal, plane, of, a, lens, the, refractive, index, n, of, the, liquid, can, then, be, calculated, from, the, maximum, transmission, angle, as, n, n, g, sin, where, n, g, is, the, refractive, index, of, the, prism, this, type, of, device, is, commonly, used, in, chemical, laboratories, for, identification, of, substances, and, for, quality, control, handheld, variants, are, used, in, agriculture, by, e, g, wine, makers, to, determine, sugar, content, in, grape, juice, and, inline, process, refractometers, are, used, in, e, g, chemical, and, pharmaceutical, industry, for, process, control, in, gemology, a, different, type, of, refractometer, is, used, to, measure, the, index, of, refraction, and, birefringence, of, gemstones, the, gem, is, placed, on, a, high, refractive, index, prism, and, illuminated, from, below, a, high, refractive, index, contact, liquid, is, used, to, achieve, optical, contact, between, the, gem, and, the, prism, at, small, incidence, angles, most, of, the, light, will, be, transmitted, into, the, gem, but, at, high, angles, total, internal, reflection, will, occur, in, the, prism, the, critical, angle, is, normally, measured, by, looking, through, a, telescope, unstained, biological, structures, appear, mostly, transparent, under, bright, field, microscopy, as, most, cellular, structures, do, not, attenuate, appreciable, quantities, of, light, nevertheless, the, variation, in, the, materials, that, constitute, these, structures, also, corresponds, to, a, variation, in, the, refractive, index, the, following, techniques, convert, such, variation, into, measurable, amplitude, differences, to, measure, the, spatial, variation, of, the, refractive, index, in, a, sample, phase, contrast, imaging, methods, are, used, these, methods, measure, the, variations, in, phase, of, the, light, wave, exiting, the, sample, the, phase, is, proportional, to, the, optical, path, length, the, light, ray, has, traversed, and, thus, gives, a, measure, of, the, integral, of, the, refractive, index, along, the, ray, path, the, phase, cannot, be, measured, directly, at, optical, or, higher, frequencies, and, therefore, needs, to, be, converted, into, intensity, by, interference, with, a, reference, beam, in, the, visual, spectrum, this, is, done, using, zernike, phase, contrast, microscopy, differential, interference, contrast, microscopy, dic, or, interferometry, zernike, phase, contrast, microscopy, introduces, a, phase, shift, to, the, low, spatial, frequency, components, of, the, image, with, a, phase, shifting, annulus, in, the, fourier, plane, of, the, sample, so, that, high, spatial, frequency, parts, of, the, image, can, interfere, with, the, low, frequency, reference, beam, in, dic, the, illumination, is, split, up, into, two, beams, that, are, given, different, polarizations, are, phase, shifted, differently, and, are, shifted, transversely, with, slightly, different, amounts, after, the, specimen, the, two, parts, are, made, to, interfere, giving, an, image, of, the, derivative, of, the, optical, path, length, in, the, direction, of, the, difference, in, the, transverse, shift, in, interferometry, the, illumination, is, split, up, into, two, beams, by, a, partially, reflective, mirror, one, of, the, beams, is, let, through, the, sample, before, they, are, combined, to, interfere, and, give, a, direct, image, of, the, phase, shifts, if, the, optical, path, length, variations, are, more, than, a, wavelength, the, image, will, contain, fringes, there, exist, several, phase, contrast, x, ray, imaging, techniques, to, determine, 2d, or, 3d, spatial, distribution, of, refractive, index, of, samples, in, the, x, ray, regime, the, refractive, index, is, an, important, property, of, the, components, of, any, optical, instrument, it, determines, the, focusing, power, of, lenses, the, dispersive, power, of, prisms, the, reflectivity, of, lens, coatings, and, the, light, guiding, nature, of, optical, fiber, since, the, refractive, index, is, a, fundamental, physical, property, of, a, substance, it, is, often, used, to, identify, a, particular, substance, confirm, its, purity, or, measure, its, concentration, the, refractive, index, is, used, to, measure, solids, liquids, and, gases, most, commonly, it, is, used, to, measure, the, concentration, of, a, solute, in, an, aqueous, solution, it, can, also, be, used, as, a, useful, tool, to, differentiate, between, different, types, of, gemstone, due, to, the, unique, chatoyance, each, individual, stone, displays, a, refractometer, is, the, instrument, used, to, measure, the, refractive, index, for, a, solution, of, sugar, the, refractive, index, can, be, used, to, determine, the, sugar, content, see, brix
