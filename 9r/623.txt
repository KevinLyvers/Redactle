a, mountain, is, an, elevated, portion, of, the, earth, s, crust, generally, with, steep, sides, that, show, significant, exposed, bedrock, although, definitions, vary, a, mountain, may, differ, from, a, plateau, in, having, a, limited, summit, area, and, is, usually, higher, than, a, hill, typically, rising, at, least, 300, metres, 980, ft, above, the, surrounding, land, a, few, mountains, are, isolated, summits, but, most, occur, in, mountain, ranges, mountains, are, formed, through, tectonic, forces, erosion, or, volcanism, which, act, on, time, scales, of, up, to, tens, of, millions, of, years, once, mountain, building, ceases, mountains, are, slowly, leveled, through, the, action, of, weathering, through, slumping, and, other, forms, of, mass, wasting, as, well, as, through, erosion, by, rivers, and, glaciers, high, elevations, on, mountains, produce, colder, climates, than, at, sea, level, at, similar, latitude, these, colder, climates, strongly, affect, the, ecosystems, of, mountains, different, elevations, have, different, plants, and, animals, because, of, the, less, hospitable, terrain, and, climate, mountains, tend, to, be, used, less, for, agriculture, and, more, for, resource, extraction, such, as, mining, and, logging, along, with, recreation, such, as, mountain, climbing, and, skiing, the, highest, mountain, on, earth, is, mount, everest, in, the, himalayas, of, asia, whose, summit, is, 8, 850, m, 29, 035, ft, above, mean, sea, level, the, highest, known, mountain, on, any, planet, in, the, solar, system, is, olympus, mons, on, mars, at, 21, 171, m, 69, 459, ft, the, tallest, mountain, including, submarine, terrain, is, mauna, kea, in, hawaii, from, its, underwater, base, at, 9, 330, m, 30, 610, ft, and, some, scientists, consider, it, to, be, the, tallest, on, earth, there, is, no, universally, accepted, definition, of, a, mountain, elevation, volume, relief, steepness, spacing, and, continuity, have, been, used, as, criteria, for, defining, a, mountain, in, the, oxford, english, dictionary, a, mountain, is, defined, as, a, natural, elevation, of, the, earth, surface, rising, more, or, less, abruptly, from, the, surrounding, level, and, attaining, an, altitude, which, relatively, to, the, adjacent, elevation, is, impressive, or, notable, whether, a, landform, is, called, a, mountain, may, depend, on, local, usage, john, whittow, s, dictionary, of, physical, geography, states, some, authorities, regard, eminences, above, 600, metres, 1, 969, ft, as, mountains, those, below, being, referred, to, as, hills, in, the, united, kingdom, and, the, republic, of, ireland, a, mountain, is, usually, defined, as, any, summit, at, least, 2, 000, feet, 610, m, high, which, accords, with, the, official, uk, government, s, definition, that, a, mountain, for, the, purposes, of, access, is, a, summit, of, 2, 000, feet, 610, m, or, higher, in, addition, some, definitions, also, include, a, topographical, prominence, requirement, such, as, that, the, mountain, rises, 300, metres, 984, ft, above, the, surrounding, terrain, at, one, time, the, us, board, on, geographic, names, defined, a, mountain, as, being, 1, 000, feet, 305, m, or, taller, but, has, abandoned, the, definition, since, the, 1970s, any, similar, landform, lower, than, this, height, was, considered, a, hill, however, today, the, us, geological, survey, concludes, that, these, terms, do, not, have, technical, definitions, in, the, us, the, un, environmental, programme, s, definition, of, mountainous, environment, includes, any, of, the, following, 74, using, these, definitions, mountains, cover, 33, of, eurasia, 19, of, south, america, 24, of, north, america, and, 14, of, africa, 14, as, a, whole, 24, of, the, earth, s, land, mass, is, mountainous, there, are, three, main, types, of, mountains, volcanic, fold, and, block, all, three, types, are, formed, from, plate, tectonics, when, portions, of, the, earth, s, crust, move, crumple, and, dive, compressional, forces, isostatic, uplift, and, intrusion, of, igneous, matter, forces, surface, rock, upward, creating, a, landform, higher, than, the, surrounding, features, the, height, of, the, feature, makes, it, either, a, hill, or, if, higher, and, steeper, a, mountain, major, mountains, tend, to, occur, in, long, linear, arcs, indicating, tectonic, plate, boundaries, and, activity, volcanoes, are, formed, when, a, plate, is, pushed, below, another, plate, or, at, a, mid, ocean, ridge, or, hotspot, at, a, depth, of, around, 100, km, 60, mi, melting, occurs, in, rock, above, the, slab, due, to, the, addition, of, water, and, forms, magma, that, reaches, the, surface, when, the, magma, reaches, the, surface, it, often, builds, a, volcanic, mountain, such, as, a, shield, volcano, or, a, stratovolcano, 194, examples, of, volcanoes, include, mount, fuji, in, japan, and, mount, pinatubo, in, the, philippines, the, magma, does, not, have, to, reach, the, surface, in, order, to, create, a, mountain, magma, that, solidifies, below, ground, can, still, form, dome, mountains, such, as, navajo, mountain, in, the, us, fold, mountains, occur, when, two, plates, collide, shortening, occurs, along, thrust, faults, and, the, crust, is, overthickened, since, the, less, dense, continental, crust, floats, on, the, denser, mantle, rocks, beneath, the, weight, of, any, crustal, material, forced, upward, to, form, hills, plateaus, or, mountains, must, be, balanced, by, the, buoyancy, force, of, a, much, greater, volume, forced, downward, into, the, mantle, thus, the, continental, crust, is, normally, much, thicker, under, mountains, compared, to, lower, lying, areas, rock, can, fold, either, symmetrically, or, asymmetrically, the, upfolds, are, anticlines, and, the, downfolds, are, synclines, in, asymmetric, folding, there, may, also, be, recumbent, and, overturned, folds, the, balkan, mountains, and, the, jura, mountains, are, examples, of, fold, mountains, block, mountains, are, caused, by, faults, in, the, crust, a, plane, where, rocks, have, moved, past, each, other, when, rocks, on, one, side, of, a, fault, rise, relative, to, the, other, it, can, form, a, mountain, the, uplifted, blocks, are, block, mountains, or, horsts, the, intervening, dropped, blocks, are, termed, graben, these, can, be, small, or, form, extensive, rift, valley, systems, this, form, of, landscape, can, be, seen, in, east, africa, the, vosges, and, rhine, valley, and, the, basin, and, range, province, of, western, north, america, these, areas, often, occur, when, the, regional, stress, is, extensional, and, the, crust, is, thinned, during, and, following, uplift, mountains, are, subjected, to, the, agents, of, erosion, water, wind, ice, and, gravity, which, gradually, wear, the, uplifted, area, down, erosion, causes, the, surface, of, mountains, to, be, younger, than, the, rocks, that, form, the, mountains, themselves, 160, glacial, processes, produce, characteristic, landforms, such, as, pyramidal, peaks, knife, edge, ar, tes, and, bowl, shaped, cirques, that, can, contain, lakes, plateau, mountains, such, as, the, catskills, are, formed, from, the, erosion, of, an, uplifted, plateau, climate, in, the, mountains, becomes, colder, at, high, elevations, due, to, an, interaction, between, radiation, and, convection, sunlight, in, the, visible, spectrum, hits, the, ground, and, heats, it, the, ground, then, heats, the, air, at, the, surface, if, radiation, were, the, only, way, to, transfer, heat, from, the, ground, to, space, the, greenhouse, effect, of, gases, in, the, atmosphere, would, keep, the, ground, at, roughly, 333, k, 60, c, 140, f, and, the, temperature, would, decay, exponentially, with, height, however, when, air, is, hot, it, tends, to, expand, which, lowers, its, density, thus, hot, air, tends, to, rise, and, transfer, heat, upward, this, is, the, process, of, convection, convection, comes, to, equilibrium, when, a, parcel, of, air, at, a, given, altitude, has, the, same, density, as, its, surroundings, air, is, a, poor, conductor, of, heat, so, a, parcel, of, air, will, rise, and, fall, without, exchanging, heat, this, is, known, as, an, adiabatic, process, which, has, a, characteristic, pressure, temperature, dependence, as, the, pressure, gets, lower, the, temperature, decreases, the, rate, of, decrease, of, temperature, with, elevation, is, known, as, the, adiabatic, lapse, rate, which, is, approximately, 9, 8, c, per, kilometre, or, 5, 4, f, 3, 0, c, per, 1000, feet, of, altitude, the, presence, of, water, in, the, atmosphere, complicates, the, process, of, convection, water, vapor, contains, latent, heat, of, vaporization, as, air, rises, and, cools, it, eventually, becomes, saturated, and, cannot, hold, its, quantity, of, water, vapor, the, water, vapor, condenses, forming, clouds, and, releases, heat, which, changes, the, lapse, rate, from, the, dry, adiabatic, lapse, rate, to, the, moist, adiabatic, lapse, rate, 5, 5, c, per, kilometre, or, 3, f, 1, 7, c, per, 1000, feet, the, actual, lapse, rate, can, vary, by, altitude, and, by, location, therefore, moving, up, 100, m, 330, ft, on, a, mountain, is, roughly, equivalent, to, moving, 80, kilometres, 45, miles, or, 0, 75, of, latitude, towards, the, nearest, pole, 15, this, relationship, is, only, approximate, however, since, local, factors, such, as, proximity, to, oceans, such, as, the, arctic, ocean, can, drastically, modify, the, climate, as, the, altitude, increases, the, main, form, of, precipitation, becomes, snow, and, the, winds, increase, 12, the, effect, of, the, climate, on, the, ecology, at, an, elevation, can, be, largely, captured, through, a, combination, of, amount, of, precipitation, and, the, biotemperature, as, described, by, leslie, holdridge, in, 1947, biotemperature, is, the, mean, temperature, all, temperatures, below, 0, c, 32, f, are, considered, to, be, 0, c, when, the, temperature, is, below, 0, c, plants, are, dormant, so, the, exact, temperature, is, unimportant, the, peaks, of, mountains, with, permanent, snow, can, have, a, biotemperature, below, 1, 5, c, 34, 7, f, mountain, environments, are, particularly, sensitive, to, anthropogenic, climate, change, and, are, currently, undergoing, alterations, unprecedented, in, last, 10, 000, years, the, effect, of, global, warming, on, mountain, regions, relative, to, lowlands, is, still, an, active, area, of, study, observational, studies, show, that, highlands, are, warming, faster, than, nearby, lowlands, but, when, compared, globally, the, effect, disappears, precipitation, in, highland, areas, is, not, increasing, as, quickly, as, in, lowland, areas, climate, simulations, give, mixed, signals, about, whether, a, particular, highland, area, will, have, increased, or, decreased, precipitation, climate, change, has, started, to, affect, the, physical, and, ecological, systems, of, mountains, in, recent, decades, mountain, ice, caps, and, glaciers, have, experienced, accelerating, ice, loss, the, melting, of, the, glaciers, permafrost, and, snow, has, caused, underlying, surfaces, to, become, increasingly, unstable, landslip, hazards, have, increased, in, both, number, and, magnitude, due, to, climate, change, patterns, of, river, discharge, will, also, be, significantly, affected, by, climate, change, which, in, turn, will, have, significant, impacts, on, communities, that, rely, on, water, fed, from, alpine, sources, nearly, half, of, mountain, areas, provide, essential, or, supportive, water, resources, for, mainly, urban, populations, in, particular, during, the, dry, season, and, in, semiarid, areas, such, as, in, central, asia, alpine, ecosystems, can, be, particularly, climatically, sensitive, many, mid, latitude, mountains, act, as, cold, climate, refugia, with, the, ecosystems, occupying, small, environmental, niches, as, well, as, the, direct, influence, that, the, change, in, climate, can, have, on, an, ecosystem, there, is, also, the, indirect, one, on, the, soils, from, changes, in, stability, and, soil, development, the, colder, climate, on, mountains, affects, the, plants, and, animals, residing, on, mountains, a, particular, set, of, plants, and, animals, tend, to, be, adapted, to, a, relatively, narrow, range, of, climate, thus, ecosystems, tend, to, lie, along, elevation, bands, of, roughly, constant, climate, this, is, called, altitudinal, zonation, in, regions, with, dry, climates, the, tendency, of, mountains, to, have, higher, precipitation, as, well, as, lower, temperatures, also, provides, for, varying, conditions, which, enhances, zonation, some, plants, and, animals, found, in, altitudinal, zones, tend, to, become, isolated, since, the, conditions, above, and, below, a, particular, zone, will, be, inhospitable, and, thus, constrain, their, movements, or, dispersal, these, isolated, ecological, systems, are, known, as, sky, islands, altitudinal, zones, tend, to, follow, a, typical, pattern, at, the, highest, elevations, trees, cannot, grow, and, whatever, life, may, be, present, will, be, of, the, alpine, type, resembling, tundra, just, below, the, tree, line, one, may, find, subalpine, forests, of, needleleaf, trees, which, can, withstand, cold, dry, conditions, below, that, montane, forests, grow, in, the, temperate, portions, of, the, earth, those, forests, tend, to, be, needleleaf, trees, while, in, the, tropics, they, can, be, broadleaf, trees, growing, in, a, rain, forest, the, highest, known, permanently, tolerable, altitude, is, at, 5, 950, metres, 19, 520, ft, at, very, high, altitudes, the, decreasing, atmospheric, pressure, means, that, less, oxygen, is, available, for, breathing, and, there, is, less, protection, against, solar, radiation, uv, above, 8, 000, metres, 26, 000, ft, elevation, there, is, not, enough, oxygen, to, support, human, life, this, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, death, zone, the, summits, of, mount, everest, and, k2, are, in, the, death, zone, mountains, are, generally, less, preferable, for, human, habitation, than, lowlands, because, of, harsh, weather, and, little, level, ground, suitable, for, agriculture, while, 7, of, the, land, area, of, earth, is, above, 2, 500, metres, 8, 200, ft, 14, only, 140, million, people, live, above, that, altitude, and, only, 20, 30, million, people, above, 3, 000, metres, 9, 800, ft, elevation, about, half, of, mountain, dwellers, live, in, the, andes, central, asia, and, africa, with, limited, access, to, infrastructure, only, a, handful, of, human, communities, exist, above, 4, 000, metres, 13, 000, ft, of, elevation, many, are, small, and, have, heavily, specialized, economies, often, relying, on, industries, such, as, agriculture, mining, and, tourism, an, example, of, such, a, specialized, town, is, la, rinconada, peru, a, gold, mining, town, and, the, highest, elevation, human, habitation, at, 5, 100, metres, 16, 700, ft, a, counterexample, is, el, alto, bolivia, at, 4, 150, metres, 13, 620, ft, which, has, a, highly, diverse, service, and, manufacturing, economy, and, a, population, of, nearly, 1, million, traditional, mountain, societies, rely, on, agriculture, with, higher, risk, of, crop, failure, than, at, lower, elevations, minerals, often, occur, in, mountains, with, mining, being, an, important, component, of, the, economics, of, some, montane, societies, more, recently, tourism, supports, mountain, communities, with, some, intensive, development, around, attractions, such, as, national, parks, or, ski, resorts, 17, about, 80, of, mountain, people, live, below, the, poverty, line, most, of, the, world, s, rivers, are, fed, from, mountain, sources, with, snow, acting, as, a, storage, mechanism, for, downstream, users, 22, more, than, half, of, humanity, depends, on, mountains, for, water, in, geopolitics, mountains, are, often, seen, as, preferable, natural, boundaries, between, polities, mountain, climbing, or, alpinism, is, the, sport, hobby, or, profession, of, hiking, skiing, and, climbing, mountains, while, mountaineering, began, as, attempts, to, reach, the, highest, point, of, unclimbed, big, mountains, it, has, branched, into, specializations, that, address, different, aspects, of, the, mountain, and, consists, of, three, areas, rock, craft, snow, craft, and, skiing, depending, on, whether, the, route, chosen, is, over, rock, snow, or, ice, all, require, experience, athletic, ability, and, technical, knowledge, of, the, terrain, to, maintain, safety, mountains, often, play, a, significant, role, in, religion, there, are, for, example, a, number, of, sacred, mountains, within, greece, such, as, mount, olympus, which, was, held, to, be, the, home, of, the, gods, in, japanese, culture, the, 3, 776, 24, m, 12, 389, 2, ft, volcano, of, mount, fuji, is, also, held, to, be, sacred, with, tens, of, thousands, of, japanese, ascending, it, each, year, mount, kailash, in, the, tibet, autonomous, region, of, china, is, considered, to, be, sacred, in, four, religions, hinduism, bon, buddhism, and, jainism, in, ireland, pilgrimages, are, made, up, the, 952, metres, 3, 123, ft, mount, brandon, by, irish, catholics, the, himalayan, peak, of, nanda, devi, is, associated, with, the, hindu, goddesses, nanda, and, sunanda, it, has, been, off, limits, to, climbers, since, 1983, mount, ararat, is, a, sacred, mountain, as, it, is, believed, to, be, the, landing, place, of, noah, s, ark, in, europe, and, especially, in, the, alps, summit, crosses, are, often, erected, on, the, tops, of, prominent, mountains, heights, of, mountains, are, typically, measured, above, sea, level, using, this, metric, mount, everest, is, the, highest, mountain, on, earth, at, 8, 848, metres, 29, 029, ft, there, are, at, least, 100, mountains, with, heights, of, over, 7, 200, metres, 23, 622, ft, above, sea, level, all, of, which, are, located, in, central, and, southern, asia, the, highest, mountains, above, sea, level, are, generally, not, the, highest, above, the, surrounding, terrain, there, is, no, precise, definition, of, surrounding, base, but, denali, mount, kilimanjaro, and, nanga, parbat, are, possible, candidates, for, the, tallest, mountain, on, land, by, this, measure, the, bases, of, mountain, islands, are, below, sea, level, and, given, this, consideration, mauna, kea, 4, 207, m, 13, 802, ft, above, sea, level, is, the, world, s, tallest, mountain, and, volcano, rising, about, 10, 203, m, 33, 474, ft, from, the, pacific, ocean, floor, the, highest, mountains, are, not, generally, the, most, voluminous, mauna, loa, 4, 169, m, or, 13, 678, ft, is, the, largest, mountain, on, earth, in, terms, of, base, area, about, 2, 000, sq, mi, or, 5, 200, km, 2, and, volume, about, 18, 000, cu, mi, or, 75, 000, km, 3, mount, kilimanjaro, is, the, largest, non, shield, volcano, in, terms, of, both, base, area, 245, sq, mi, or, 635, km, 2, and, volume, 1, 150, cu, mi, or, 4, 793, km, 3, mount, logan, is, the, largest, non, volcanic, mountain, in, base, area, 120, sq, mi, or, 311, km, 2, the, highest, mountains, above, sea, level, are, also, not, those, with, peaks, farthest, from, the, centre, of, the, earth, because, the, figure, of, the, earth, is, not, spherical, sea, level, closer, to, the, equator, is, several, miles, farther, from, the, centre, of, the, earth, the, summit, of, chimborazo, ecuador, s, tallest, mountain, is, usually, considered, to, be, the, farthest, point, from, the, earth, s, centre, although, the, southern, summit, of, peru, s, tallest, mountain, huascar, n, is, another, contender, both, have, elevations, above, sea, level, more, than, 2, kilometres, 6, 600, ft, less, than, that, of, everest
