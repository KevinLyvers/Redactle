a, particle, accelerator, is, a, machine, that, uses, electromagnetic, fields, to, propel, charged, particles, to, very, high, speeds, and, energies, to, contain, them, in, well, defined, beams, small, accelerators, are, used, for, fundamental, research, in, particle, physics, accelerators, are, also, used, as, synchrotron, light, sources, for, the, study, of, condensed, matter, physics, smaller, particle, accelerators, are, used, in, a, wide, variety, of, applications, including, particle, therapy, for, oncological, purposes, radioisotope, production, for, medical, diagnostics, ion, implanters, for, the, manufacture, of, semiconductors, and, accelerator, mass, spectrometers, for, measurements, of, rare, isotopes, such, as, radiocarbon, large, accelerators, include, the, relativistic, heavy, ion, collider, at, brookhaven, national, laboratory, in, new, york, and, the, largest, accelerator, the, large, hadron, collider, near, geneva, switzerland, operated, by, cern, it, is, a, collider, accelerator, which, can, accelerate, two, beams, of, protons, to, an, energy, of, 6, 5, tev, and, cause, them, to, collide, head, on, creating, center, of, mass, energies, of, 13, tev, there, are, more, than, 30, 000, accelerators, in, operation, around, the, world, there, are, two, basic, classes, of, accelerators, electrostatic, and, electrodynamic, or, electromagnetic, accelerators, electrostatic, particle, accelerators, use, static, electric, fields, to, accelerate, particles, the, most, common, types, are, the, cockcroft, walton, generator, and, the, van, de, graaff, generator, a, small, scale, example, of, this, class, is, the, cathode, ray, tube, in, an, ordinary, old, television, set, the, achievable, kinetic, energy, for, particles, in, these, devices, is, determined, by, the, accelerating, voltage, which, is, limited, by, electrical, breakdown, electrodynamic, or, electromagnetic, accelerators, on, the, other, hand, use, changing, electromagnetic, fields, either, magnetic, induction, or, oscillating, radio, frequency, fields, to, accelerate, particles, since, in, these, types, the, particles, can, pass, through, the, same, accelerating, field, multiple, times, the, output, energy, is, not, limited, by, the, strength, of, the, accelerating, field, this, class, which, was, first, developed, in, the, 1920s, is, the, basis, for, most, modern, large, scale, accelerators, rolf, wider, e, gustav, ising, le, szil, rd, max, steenbeck, and, ernest, lawrence, are, considered, pioneers, of, this, field, having, conceived, and, built, the, first, operational, linear, particle, accelerator, the, betatron, as, well, as, the, cyclotron, because, the, target, of, the, particle, beams, of, early, accelerators, was, usually, the, atoms, of, a, piece, of, matter, with, the, goal, being, to, create, collisions, with, their, nuclei, in, order, to, investigate, nuclear, structure, accelerators, were, commonly, referred, to, as, atom, smashers, in, the, 20th, century, the, term, persists, despite, the, fact, that, many, modern, accelerators, create, collisions, between, two, subatomic, particles, rather, than, a, particle, and, an, atomic, nucleus, beams, of, high, energy, particles, are, useful, for, fundamental, and, applied, research, in, the, sciences, and, also, in, many, technical, and, industrial, fields, unrelated, to, fundamental, research, there, are, approximately, 30, 000, accelerators, worldwide, of, these, only, about, 1, are, research, machines, with, energies, above, 1, gev, while, about, 44, are, for, radiotherapy, 41, for, ion, implantation, 9, for, industrial, processing, and, research, and, 4, for, biomedical, and, other, low, energy, research, for, the, most, basic, inquiries, into, the, dynamics, and, structure, of, matter, space, and, time, physicists, seek, the, simplest, kinds, of, interactions, at, the, highest, possible, energies, these, typically, entail, particle, energies, of, many, gev, and, interactions, of, the, simplest, kinds, of, particles, leptons, e, g, electrons, and, positrons, and, quarks, for, the, matter, or, photons, and, gluons, for, the, field, quanta, since, isolated, quarks, are, experimentally, unavailable, due, to, color, confinement, the, simplest, available, experiments, involve, the, interactions, of, first, leptons, with, each, other, and, second, of, leptons, with, nucleons, which, are, composed, of, quarks, and, gluons, to, study, the, collisions, of, quarks, with, each, other, scientists, resort, to, collisions, of, nucleons, which, at, high, energy, may, be, usefully, considered, as, essentially, 2, body, interactions, of, the, quarks, and, gluons, of, which, they, are, composed, this, elementary, particle, physicists, tend, to, use, machines, creating, beams, of, electrons, positrons, protons, and, antiprotons, interacting, with, each, other, or, with, the, simplest, nuclei, e, g, hydrogen, or, deuterium, at, the, highest, possible, energies, generally, hundreds, of, gev, or, more, the, largest, and, highest, energy, particle, accelerator, used, for, elementary, particle, physics, is, the, large, hadron, collider, lhc, at, cern, operating, since, 2009, nuclear, physicists, and, cosmologists, may, use, beams, of, bare, atomic, nuclei, stripped, of, electrons, to, investigate, the, structure, interactions, and, properties, of, the, nuclei, themselves, and, of, condensed, matter, at, extremely, high, temperatures, and, densities, such, as, might, have, occurred, in, the, first, moments, of, the, big, bang, these, investigations, often, involve, collisions, of, heavy, nuclei, of, atoms, like, iron, or, gold, at, energies, of, several, gev, per, nucleon, the, largest, such, particle, accelerator, is, the, relativistic, heavy, ion, collider, rhic, at, brookhaven, national, laboratory, particle, accelerators, can, also, produce, proton, beams, which, can, produce, proton, rich, medical, or, research, isotopes, as, opposed, to, the, neutron, rich, ones, made, in, fission, reactors, however, recent, work, has, shown, how, to, make, 99, mo, usually, made, in, reactors, by, accelerating, isotopes, of, hydrogen, although, this, method, still, requires, a, reactor, to, produce, tritium, an, example, of, this, type, of, machine, is, lansce, at, los, alamos, national, laboratory, electrons, propagating, through, a, magnetic, field, emit, very, bright, and, coherent, photon, beams, via, synchrotron, radiation, it, has, numerous, uses, in, the, study, of, atomic, structure, chemistry, condensed, matter, physics, biology, and, technology, a, large, number, of, synchrotron, light, sources, exist, worldwide, examples, in, the, u, s, are, ssrl, at, slac, national, accelerator, laboratory, aps, at, argonne, national, laboratory, als, at, lawrence, berkeley, national, laboratory, and, nsls, ii, at, brookhaven, national, laboratory, in, europe, there, are, max, iv, in, lund, sweden, bessy, in, berlin, germany, diamond, in, oxfordshire, uk, esrf, in, grenoble, france, the, latter, has, been, used, to, extract, detailed, 3, dimensional, images, of, insects, trapped, in, amber, free, electron, lasers, fels, are, a, special, class, of, light, sources, based, on, synchrotron, radiation, that, provides, shorter, pulses, with, higher, temporal, coherence, a, specially, designed, fel, is, the, most, brilliant, source, of, x, rays, in, the, observable, universe, the, most, prominent, examples, are, the, lcls, in, the, u, s, and, european, xfel, in, germany, more, attention, is, being, drawn, towards, soft, x, ray, lasers, which, together, with, pulse, shortening, opens, up, new, methods, for, attosecond, science, apart, from, x, rays, fels, are, used, to, emit, terahertz, light, e, g, felix, in, nijmegen, netherlands, telbe, in, dresden, germany, and, novofel, in, novosibirsk, russia, thus, there, is, a, great, demand, for, electron, accelerators, of, moderate, gev, energy, high, intensity, and, high, beam, quality, to, drive, light, sources, everyday, examples, of, particle, accelerators, are, cathode, ray, tubes, found, in, television, sets, and, x, ray, generators, these, low, energy, accelerators, use, a, single, pair, of, electrodes, with, a, dc, voltage, of, a, few, thousand, volts, between, them, in, an, x, ray, generator, the, target, itself, is, one, of, the, electrodes, a, low, energy, particle, accelerator, called, an, ion, implanter, is, used, in, the, manufacture, of, integrated, circuits, at, lower, energies, beams, of, accelerated, nuclei, are, also, used, in, medicine, as, particle, therapy, for, the, treatment, of, cancer, dc, accelerator, types, capable, of, accelerating, particles, to, speeds, sufficient, to, cause, nuclear, reactions, are, cockcroft, walton, generators, or, voltage, multipliers, which, convert, ac, to, high, voltage, dc, or, van, de, graaff, generators, that, use, static, electricity, carried, by, belts, electron, beam, processing, is, commonly, used, for, sterilization, electron, beams, are, an, on, off, technology, that, provide, a, much, higher, dose, rate, than, gamma, or, x, rays, emitted, by, radioisotopes, like, cobalt, 60, 60, co, or, caesium, 137, 137, cs, due, to, the, higher, dose, rate, less, exposure, time, is, required, and, polymer, degradation, is, reduced, because, electrons, carry, a, charge, electron, beams, are, less, penetrating, than, both, gamma, and, x, rays, historically, the, first, accelerators, used, simple, technology, of, a, single, static, high, voltage, to, accelerate, charged, particles, the, charged, particle, was, accelerated, through, an, evacuated, tube, with, an, electrode, at, either, end, with, the, static, potential, across, it, since, the, particle, passed, only, once, through, the, potential, difference, the, output, energy, was, limited, to, the, accelerating, voltage, of, the, machine, while, this, method, is, still, extremely, popular, today, with, the, electrostatic, accelerators, greatly, out, numbering, any, other, type, they, are, more, suited, to, lower, energy, studies, owing, to, the, practical, voltage, limit, of, about, 1, mv, for, air, insulated, machines, or, 30, mv, when, the, accelerator, is, operated, in, a, tank, of, pressurized, gas, with, high, dielectric, strength, such, as, sulfur, hexafluoride, in, a, tandem, accelerator, the, potential, is, used, twice, to, accelerate, the, particles, by, reversing, the, charge, of, the, particles, while, they, are, inside, the, terminal, this, is, possible, with, the, acceleration, of, atomic, nuclei, by, using, anions, negatively, charged, ions, and, then, passing, the, beam, through, a, thin, foil, to, strip, electrons, off, the, anions, inside, the, high, voltage, terminal, converting, them, to, cations, positively, charged, ions, which, are, accelerated, again, as, they, leave, the, terminal, the, two, main, types, of, electrostatic, accelerator, are, the, cockcroft, walton, accelerator, which, uses, a, diode, capacitor, voltage, multiplier, to, produce, high, voltage, and, the, van, de, graaff, accelerator, which, uses, a, moving, fabric, belt, to, carry, charge, to, the, high, voltage, electrode, although, electrostatic, accelerators, accelerate, particles, along, a, straight, line, the, term, linear, accelerator, is, more, often, used, for, accelerators, that, employ, oscillating, rather, than, static, electric, fields, due, to, the, high, voltage, ceiling, imposed, by, electrical, discharge, in, order, to, accelerate, particles, to, higher, energies, techniques, involving, dynamic, fields, rather, than, static, fields, are, used, electrodynamic, acceleration, can, arise, from, either, of, two, mechanisms, non, resonant, magnetic, induction, or, resonant, circuits, or, cavities, excited, by, oscillating, radio, frequency, rf, fields, electrodynamic, accelerators, can, be, linear, with, particles, accelerating, in, a, straight, line, or, circular, using, magnetic, fields, to, bend, particles, in, a, roughly, circular, orbit, magnetic, induction, accelerators, accelerate, particles, by, induction, from, an, increasing, magnetic, field, as, if, the, particles, were, the, secondary, winding, in, a, transformer, the, increasing, magnetic, field, creates, a, circulating, electric, field, which, can, be, configured, to, accelerate, the, particles, induction, accelerators, can, be, either, linear, or, circular, linear, induction, accelerators, utilize, ferrite, loaded, non, resonant, induction, cavities, each, cavity, can, be, thought, of, as, two, large, washer, shaped, disks, connected, by, an, outer, cylindrical, tube, between, the, disks, is, a, ferrite, toroid, a, voltage, pulse, applied, between, the, two, disks, causes, an, increasing, magnetic, field, which, inductively, couples, power, into, the, charged, particle, beam, the, linear, induction, accelerator, was, invented, by, christofilos, in, the, 1960s, linear, induction, accelerators, are, capable, of, accelerating, very, high, beam, currents, 1000, a, in, a, single, short, pulse, they, have, been, used, to, generate, x, rays, for, flash, radiography, e, g, darht, at, lanl, and, have, been, considered, as, particle, injectors, for, magnetic, confinement, fusion, and, as, drivers, for, free, electron, lasers, the, betatron, is, a, circular, magnetic, induction, accelerator, invented, by, donald, kerst, in, 1940, for, accelerating, electrons, the, concept, originates, ultimately, from, norwegian, german, scientist, rolf, wider, e, these, machines, like, synchrotrons, use, a, donut, shaped, ring, magnet, see, below, with, a, cyclically, increasing, b, field, but, accelerate, the, particles, by, induction, from, the, increasing, magnetic, field, as, if, they, were, the, secondary, winding, in, a, transformer, due, to, the, changing, magnetic, flux, through, the, orbit, achieving, constant, orbital, radius, while, supplying, the, proper, accelerating, electric, field, requires, that, the, magnetic, flux, linking, the, orbit, be, somewhat, independent, of, the, magnetic, field, on, the, orbit, bending, the, particles, into, a, constant, radius, curve, these, machines, have, in, practice, been, limited, by, the, large, radiative, losses, suffered, by, the, electrons, moving, at, nearly, the, speed, of, light, in, a, relatively, small, radius, orbit, in, a, linear, particle, accelerator, linac, particles, are, accelerated, in, a, straight, line, with, a, target, of, interest, at, one, end, they, are, often, used, to, provide, an, initial, low, energy, kick, to, particles, before, they, are, injected, into, circular, accelerators, the, longest, linac, in, the, world, is, the, stanford, linear, accelerator, slac, which, is, 3, km, 1, 9, mi, long, slac, was, originally, an, electron, positron, collider, but, is, now, a, x, ray, free, electron, laser, linear, high, energy, accelerators, use, a, linear, array, of, plates, or, drift, tubes, to, which, an, alternating, high, energy, field, is, applied, as, the, particles, approach, a, plate, they, are, accelerated, towards, it, by, an, opposite, polarity, charge, applied, to, the, plate, as, they, pass, through, a, hole, in, the, plate, the, polarity, is, switched, so, that, the, plate, now, repels, them, and, they, are, now, accelerated, by, it, towards, the, next, plate, normally, a, stream, of, bunches, of, particles, are, accelerated, so, a, carefully, controlled, ac, voltage, is, applied, to, each, plate, to, continuously, repeat, this, process, for, each, bunch, as, the, particles, approach, the, speed, of, light, the, switching, rate, of, the, electric, fields, becomes, so, high, that, they, operate, at, radio, frequencies, and, so, microwave, cavities, are, used, in, higher, energy, machines, instead, of, simple, plates, linear, accelerators, are, also, widely, used, in, medicine, for, radiotherapy, and, radiosurgery, medical, grade, linacs, accelerate, electrons, using, a, klystron, and, a, complex, bending, magnet, arrangement, which, produces, a, beam, of, energy, 6, 30, mev, the, electrons, can, be, used, directly, or, they, can, be, collided, with, a, target, to, produce, a, beam, of, x, rays, the, reliability, flexibility, and, accuracy, of, the, radiation, beam, produced, has, largely, supplanted, the, older, use, of, cobalt, 60, therapy, as, a, treatment, tool, in, the, circular, accelerator, particles, move, in, a, circle, until, they, reach, enough, energy, the, particle, track, is, typically, bent, into, a, circle, using, electromagnets, the, advantage, of, circular, accelerators, over, linear, accelerators, linacs, is, that, the, ring, topology, allows, continuous, acceleration, as, the, particle, can, transit, indefinitely, another, advantage, is, that, a, circular, accelerator, is, smaller, than, a, linear, accelerator, of, comparable, power, i, e, a, linac, would, have, to, be, extremely, long, to, have, the, equivalent, power, of, a, circular, accelerator, depending, on, the, energy, and, the, particle, being, accelerated, circular, accelerators, suffer, a, disadvantage, in, that, the, particles, emit, synchrotron, radiation, when, any, charged, particle, is, accelerated, it, emits, electromagnetic, radiation, and, secondary, emissions, as, a, particle, traveling, in, a, circle, is, always, accelerating, towards, the, center, of, the, circle, it, continuously, radiates, towards, the, tangent, of, the, circle, this, radiation, is, called, synchrotron, light, and, depends, highly, on, the, mass, of, the, accelerating, particle, for, this, reason, many, high, energy, electron, accelerators, are, linacs, certain, accelerators, synchrotrons, are, however, built, specially, for, producing, synchrotron, light, x, rays, since, the, special, theory, of, relativity, requires, that, matter, always, travels, slower, than, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, in, high, energy, accelerators, as, the, energy, increases, the, particle, speed, approaches, the, speed, of, light, as, a, limit, but, never, attains, it, therefore, particle, physicists, do, not, generally, think, in, terms, of, speed, but, rather, in, terms, of, a, particle, s, energy, or, momentum, usually, measured, in, electron, volts, ev, an, important, principle, for, circular, accelerators, and, particle, beams, in, general, is, that, the, curvature, of, the, particle, trajectory, is, proportional, to, the, particle, charge, and, to, the, magnetic, field, but, inversely, proportional, to, the, typically, relativistic, momentum, the, earliest, operational, circular, accelerators, were, cyclotrons, invented, in, 1929, by, ernest, lawrence, at, the, university, of, california, berkeley, cyclotrons, have, a, single, pair, of, hollow, d, shaped, plates, to, accelerate, the, particles, and, a, single, large, dipole, magnet, to, bend, their, path, into, a, circular, orbit, it, is, a, characteristic, property, of, charged, particles, in, a, uniform, and, constant, magnetic, field, b, that, they, orbit, with, a, constant, period, at, a, frequency, called, the, cyclotron, frequency, so, long, as, their, speed, is, small, compared, to, the, speed, of, light, c, this, means, that, the, accelerating, d, s, of, a, cyclotron, can, be, driven, at, a, constant, frequency, by, a, rf, accelerating, power, source, as, the, beam, spirals, outwards, continuously, the, particles, are, injected, in, the, center, of, the, magnet, and, are, extracted, at, the, outer, edge, at, their, maximum, energy, cyclotrons, reach, an, energy, limit, because, of, relativistic, effects, whereby, the, particles, effectively, become, more, massive, so, that, their, cyclotron, frequency, drops, out, of, sync, with, the, accelerating, rf, therefore, simple, cyclotrons, can, accelerate, protons, only, to, an, energy, of, around, 15, million, electron, volts, 15, mev, corresponding, to, a, speed, of, roughly, 10, of, c, because, the, protons, get, out, of, phase, with, the, driving, electric, field, if, accelerated, further, the, beam, would, continue, to, spiral, outward, to, a, larger, radius, but, the, particles, would, no, longer, gain, enough, speed, to, complete, the, larger, circle, in, step, with, the, accelerating, rf, to, accommodate, relativistic, effects, the, magnetic, field, needs, to, be, increased, to, higher, radii, as, is, done, in, isochronous, cyclotrons, an, example, of, an, isochronous, cyclotron, is, the, psi, ring, cyclotron, in, switzerland, which, provides, protons, at, the, energy, of, 590, mev, which, corresponds, to, roughly, 80, of, the, speed, of, light, the, advantage, of, such, a, cyclotron, is, the, maximum, achievable, extracted, proton, current, which, is, currently, 2, 2, ma, the, energy, and, current, correspond, to, 1, 3, mw, beam, power, which, is, the, highest, of, any, accelerator, currently, existing, a, classic, cyclotron, can, be, modified, to, increase, its, energy, limit, the, historically, first, approach, was, the, synchrocyclotron, which, accelerates, the, particles, in, bunches, it, uses, a, constant, magnetic, field, b, displaystyle, b, but, reduces, the, accelerating, field, s, frequency, so, as, to, keep, the, particles, in, step, as, they, spiral, outward, matching, their, mass, dependent, cyclotron, resonance, frequency, this, approach, suffers, from, low, average, beam, intensity, due, to, the, bunching, and, again, from, the, need, for, a, huge, magnet, of, large, radius, and, constant, field, over, the, larger, orbit, demanded, by, high, energy, the, second, approach, to, the, problem, of, accelerating, relativistic, particles, is, the, isochronous, cyclotron, in, such, a, structure, the, accelerating, field, s, frequency, and, the, cyclotron, resonance, frequency, is, kept, constant, for, all, energies, by, shaping, the, magnet, poles, so, to, increase, magnetic, field, with, radius, thus, all, particles, get, accelerated, in, isochronous, time, intervals, higher, energy, particles, travel, a, shorter, distance, in, each, orbit, than, they, would, in, a, classical, cyclotron, thus, remaining, in, phase, with, the, accelerating, field, the, advantage, of, the, isochronous, cyclotron, is, that, it, can, deliver, continuous, beams, of, higher, average, intensity, which, is, useful, for, some, applications, the, main, disadvantages, are, the, size, and, cost, of, the, large, magnet, needed, and, the, difficulty, in, achieving, the, high, magnetic, field, values, required, at, the, outer, edge, of, the, structure, synchrocyclotrons, have, not, been, built, since, the, isochronous, cyclotron, was, developed, to, reach, still, higher, energies, with, relativistic, mass, approaching, or, exceeding, the, rest, mass, of, the, particles, for, protons, billions, of, electron, volts, or, gev, it, is, necessary, to, use, a, synchrotron, this, is, an, accelerator, in, which, the, particles, are, accelerated, in, a, ring, of, constant, radius, an, immediate, advantage, over, cyclotrons, is, that, the, magnetic, field, need, only, be, present, over, the, actual, region, of, the, particle, orbits, which, is, much, narrower, than, that, of, the, ring, the, largest, cyclotron, built, in, the, us, had, a, 184, inch, diameter, 4, 7, m, magnet, pole, whereas, the, diameter, of, synchrotrons, such, as, the, lep, and, lhc, is, nearly, 10, km, the, aperture, of, the, two, beams, of, the, lhc, is, of, the, order, of, a, centimeter, the, lhc, contains, 16, rf, cavities, 1232, superconducting, dipole, magnets, for, beam, steering, and, 24, quadrupoles, for, beam, focusing, even, at, this, size, the, lhc, is, limited, by, its, ability, to, steer, the, particles, without, them, going, adrift, this, limit, is, theorized, to, occur, at, 14, tev, however, since, the, particle, momentum, increases, during, acceleration, it, is, necessary, to, turn, up, the, magnetic, field, b, in, proportion, to, maintain, constant, curvature, of, the, orbit, in, consequence, synchrotrons, cannot, accelerate, particles, continuously, as, cyclotrons, can, but, must, operate, cyclically, supplying, particles, in, bunches, which, are, delivered, to, a, target, or, an, external, beam, in, beam, spills, typically, every, few, seconds, since, high, energy, synchrotrons, do, most, of, their, work, on, particles, that, are, already, traveling, at, nearly, the, speed, of, light, c, the, time, to, complete, one, orbit, of, the, ring, is, nearly, constant, as, is, the, frequency, of, the, rf, cavity, resonators, used, to, drive, the, acceleration, in, modern, synchrotrons, the, beam, aperture, is, small, and, the, magnetic, field, does, not, cover, the, entire, area, of, the, particle, orbit, as, it, does, for, a, cyclotron, so, several, necessary, functions, can, be, separated, instead, of, one, huge, magnet, one, has, a, line, of, hundreds, of, bending, magnets, enclosing, or, enclosed, by, vacuum, connecting, pipes, the, design, of, synchrotrons, was, revolutionized, in, the, early, 1950s, with, the, discovery, of, the, strong, focusing, concept, the, focusing, of, the, beam, is, handled, independently, by, specialized, quadrupole, magnets, while, the, acceleration, itself, is, accomplished, in, separate, rf, sections, rather, similar, to, short, linear, accelerators, also, there, is, no, necessity, that, cyclic, machines, be, circular, but, rather, the, beam, pipe, may, have, straight, sections, between, magnets, where, beams, may, collide, be, cooled, etc, this, has, developed, into, an, entire, separate, subject, called, beam, physics, or, beam, optics, more, complex, modern, synchrotrons, such, as, the, tevatron, lep, and, lhc, may, deliver, the, particle, bunches, into, storage, rings, of, magnets, with, a, constant, magnetic, field, where, they, can, continue, to, orbit, for, long, periods, for, experimentation, or, further, acceleration, the, highest, energy, machines, such, as, the, tevatron, and, lhc, are, actually, accelerator, complexes, with, a, cascade, of, specialized, elements, in, series, including, linear, accelerators, for, initial, beam, creation, one, or, more, low, energy, synchrotrons, to, reach, intermediate, energy, storage, rings, where, beams, can, be, accumulated, or, cooled, reducing, the, magnet, aperture, required, and, permitting, tighter, focusing, see, beam, cooling, and, a, last, large, ring, for, final, acceleration, and, experimentation, circular, electron, accelerators, fell, somewhat, out, of, favor, for, particle, physics, around, the, time, that, slac, s, linear, particle, accelerator, was, constructed, because, their, synchrotron, losses, were, considered, economically, prohibitive, and, because, their, beam, intensity, was, lower, than, for, the, unpulsed, linear, machines, the, cornell, electron, synchrotron, built, at, low, cost, in, the, late, 1970s, was, the, first, in, a, series, of, high, energy, circular, electron, accelerators, built, for, fundamental, particle, physics, the, last, being, lep, built, at, cern, which, was, used, from, 1989, until, 2000, a, large, number, of, electron, synchrotrons, have, been, built, in, the, past, two, decades, as, part, of, synchrotron, light, sources, that, emit, ultraviolet, light, and, x, rays, see, below, some, circular, accelerators, have, been, built, to, deliberately, generate, radiation, called, synchrotron, light, as, x, rays, also, called, synchrotron, radiation, for, example, the, diamond, light, source, which, has, been, built, at, the, rutherford, appleton, laboratory, in, england, or, the, advanced, photon, source, at, argonne, national, laboratory, in, illinois, usa, high, energy, x, rays, are, useful, for, x, ray, spectroscopy, of, proteins, or, x, ray, absorption, fine, structure, xafs, for, example, synchrotron, radiation, is, more, powerfully, emitted, by, lighter, particles, so, these, accelerators, are, invariably, electron, accelerators, synchrotron, radiation, allows, for, better, imaging, as, researched, and, developed, at, slac, s, spear, fixed, field, alternating, gradient, accelerators, ffa, s, in, which, a, magnetic, field, which, is, fixed, in, time, but, with, a, radial, variation, to, achieve, strong, focusing, allows, the, beam, to, be, accelerated, with, a, high, repetition, rate, but, in, a, much, smaller, radial, spread, than, in, the, cyclotron, case, isochronous, ffas, like, isochronous, cyclotrons, achieve, continuous, beam, operation, but, without, the, need, for, a, huge, dipole, bending, magnet, covering, the, entire, radius, of, the, orbits, some, new, developments, in, ffas, are, covered, in, a, rhodotron, is, an, industrial, electron, accelerator, first, proposed, in, 1987, by, j, pottier, of, the, french, atomic, energy, agency, cea, manufactured, by, belgian, company, ion, beam, applications, it, accelerates, electrons, by, recirculating, them, across, the, diameter, of, a, cylinder, shaped, radiofrequency, cavity, a, rhodotron, has, an, electron, gun, which, emits, an, electron, beam, that, is, attracted, to, a, pillar, in, the, center, of, the, cavity, the, pillar, has, holes, the, electrons, can, pass, through, the, electron, beam, passes, through, the, pillar, via, one, of, these, holes, and, then, travels, through, a, hole, in, the, wall, of, the, cavity, and, meets, a, bending, magnet, the, beam, is, then, bent, and, sent, back, into, the, cavity, to, another, hole, in, the, pillar, the, electrons, then, again, go, across, the, pillar, and, pass, though, another, part, of, the, wall, of, the, cavity, and, into, another, bending, magnet, and, so, on, gradually, increasing, the, energy, of, the, beam, until, it, is, allowed, to, exit, the, cavity, for, use, the, cylinder, and, pillar, may, be, lined, with, copper, on, the, inside, ernest, lawrence, s, first, cyclotron, was, a, mere, 4, inches, 100, mm, in, diameter, later, in, 1939, he, built, a, machine, with, a, 60, inch, diameter, pole, face, and, planned, one, with, a, 184, inch, diameter, in, 1942, which, was, however, taken, over, for, world, war, ii, related, work, connected, with, uranium, isotope, separation, after, the, war, it, continued, in, service, for, research, and, medicine, over, many, years, the, first, large, proton, synchrotron, was, the, cosmotron, at, brookhaven, national, laboratory, which, accelerated, protons, to, about, 3, gev, 1953, 1968, the, bevatron, at, berkeley, completed, in, 1954, was, specifically, designed, to, accelerate, protons, to, enough, energy, to, create, antiprotons, and, verify, the, particle, antiparticle, symmetry, of, nature, then, only, theorized, the, alternating, gradient, synchrotron, ags, at, brookhaven, 1960, was, the, first, large, synchrotron, with, alternating, gradient, strong, focusing, magnets, which, greatly, reduced, the, required, aperture, of, the, beam, and, correspondingly, the, size, and, cost, of, the, bending, magnets, the, proton, synchrotron, built, at, cern, 1959, was, the, first, major, european, particle, accelerator, and, generally, similar, to, the, ags, the, stanford, linear, accelerator, slac, became, operational, in, 1966, accelerating, electrons, to, 30, gev, in, a, 3, km, long, waveguide, buried, in, a, tunnel, and, powered, by, hundreds, of, large, klystrons, it, is, still, the, largest, linear, accelerator, in, existence, and, has, been, upgraded, with, the, addition, of, storage, rings, and, an, electron, positron, collider, facility, it, is, also, an, x, ray, and, uv, synchrotron, photon, source, the, fermilab, tevatron, has, a, ring, with, a, beam, path, of, 4, miles, 6, 4, km, it, has, received, several, upgrades, and, has, functioned, as, a, proton, antiproton, collider, until, it, was, shut, down, due, to, budget, cuts, on, september, 30, 2011, the, largest, circular, accelerator, ever, built, was, the, lep, synchrotron, at, cern, with, a, circumference, 26, 6, kilometers, which, was, an, electron, positron, collider, it, achieved, an, energy, of, 209, gev, before, it, was, dismantled, in, 2000, so, that, the, tunnel, could, be, used, for, the, large, hadron, collider, lhc, the, lhc, is, a, proton, collider, and, currently, the, world, s, largest, and, highest, energy, accelerator, achieving, 6, 5, tev, energy, per, beam, 13, tev, in, total, the, aborted, superconducting, super, collider, ssc, in, texas, would, have, had, a, circumference, of, 87, km, construction, was, started, in, 1991, but, abandoned, in, 1993, very, large, circular, accelerators, are, invariably, built, in, tunnels, a, few, metres, wide, to, minimize, the, disruption, and, cost, of, building, such, a, structure, on, the, surface, and, to, provide, shielding, against, intense, secondary, radiations, that, occur, which, are, extremely, penetrating, at, high, energies, current, accelerators, such, as, the, spallation, neutron, source, incorporate, superconducting, cryomodules, the, relativistic, heavy, ion, collider, and, large, hadron, collider, also, make, use, of, superconducting, magnets, and, rf, cavity, resonators, to, accelerate, particles, the, output, of, a, particle, accelerator, can, generally, be, directed, towards, multiple, lines, of, experiments, one, at, a, given, time, by, means, of, a, deviating, electromagnet, this, makes, it, possible, to, operate, multiple, experiments, without, needing, to, move, things, around, or, shutting, down, the, entire, accelerator, beam, except, for, synchrotron, radiation, sources, the, purpose, of, an, accelerator, is, to, generate, high, energy, particles, for, interaction, with, matter, this, is, usually, a, fixed, target, such, as, the, phosphor, coating, on, the, back, of, the, screen, in, the, case, of, a, television, tube, a, piece, of, uranium, in, an, accelerator, designed, as, a, neutron, source, or, a, tungsten, target, for, an, x, ray, generator, in, a, linac, the, target, is, simply, fitted, to, the, end, of, the, accelerator, the, particle, track, in, a, cyclotron, is, a, spiral, outwards, from, the, centre, of, the, circular, machine, so, the, accelerated, particles, emerge, from, a, fixed, point, as, for, a, linear, accelerator, for, synchrotrons, the, situation, is, more, complex, particles, are, accelerated, to, the, desired, energy, then, a, fast, acting, dipole, magnet, is, used, to, switch, the, particles, out, of, the, circular, synchrotron, tube, and, towards, the, target, a, variation, commonly, used, for, particle, physics, research, is, a, collider, also, called, a, storage, ring, collider, two, circular, synchrotrons, are, built, in, close, proximity, usually, on, top, of, each, other, and, using, the, same, magnets, which, are, then, of, more, complicated, design, to, accommodate, both, beam, tubes, bunches, of, particles, travel, in, opposite, directions, around, the, two, accelerators, and, collide, at, intersections, between, them, this, can, increase, the, energy, enormously, whereas, in, a, fixed, target, experiment, the, energy, available, to, produce, new, particles, is, proportional, to, the, square, root, of, the, beam, energy, in, a, collider, the, available, energy, is, linear, the, detectors, gather, clues, about, the, particles, including, their, speed, and, charge, using, these, the, scientists, can, actually, work, on, the, particle, the, process, of, detection, is, very, complex, it, requires, strong, electromagnets, and, accelerators, at, present, the, highest, energy, accelerators, are, all, circular, colliders, but, both, hadron, accelerators, and, electron, accelerators, are, running, into, limits, higher, energy, hadron, and, ion, cyclic, accelerators, will, require, accelerator, tunnels, of, larger, physical, size, due, to, the, increased, beam, rigidity, for, cyclic, electron, accelerators, a, limit, on, practical, bend, radius, is, placed, by, synchrotron, radiation, losses, and, the, next, generation, will, probably, be, linear, accelerators, 10, times, the, current, length, an, example, of, such, a, next, generation, electron, accelerator, is, the, proposed, 40, km, long, international, linear, collider, it, is, believed, that, plasma, wakefield, acceleration, in, the, form, of, electron, beam, afterburners, and, standalone, laser, pulsers, might, be, able, to, provide, dramatic, increases, in, efficiency, over, rf, accelerators, within, two, to, three, decades, in, plasma, wakefield, accelerators, the, beam, cavity, is, filled, with, a, plasma, rather, than, vacuum, a, short, pulse, of, electrons, or, laser, light, either, constitutes, or, immediately, precedes, the, particles, that, are, being, accelerated, the, pulse, disrupts, the, plasma, causing, the, charged, particles, in, the, plasma, to, integrate, into, and, move, toward, the, rear, of, the, bunch, of, particles, that, are, being, accelerated, this, process, transfers, energy, to, the, particle, bunch, accelerating, it, further, and, continues, as, long, as, the, pulse, is, coherent, energy, gradients, as, steep, as, 200, gev, m, have, been, achieved, over, millimeter, scale, distances, using, laser, pulsers, and, gradients, approaching, 1, gev, m, are, being, produced, on, the, multi, centimeter, scale, with, electron, beam, systems, in, contrast, to, a, limit, of, about, 0, 1, gev, m, for, radio, frequency, acceleration, alone, existing, electron, accelerators, such, as, slac, could, use, electron, beam, afterburners, to, greatly, increase, the, energy, of, their, particle, beams, at, the, cost, of, beam, intensity, electron, systems, in, general, can, provide, tightly, collimated, reliable, beams, laser, systems, may, offer, more, power, and, compactness, thus, plasma, wakefield, accelerators, could, be, used, if, technical, issues, can, be, resolved, to, both, increase, the, maximum, energy, of, the, largest, accelerators, and, to, bring, high, energies, into, university, laboratories, and, medical, centres, higher, than, 0, 25, gev, m, gradients, have, been, achieved, by, a, dielectric, laser, accelerator, which, may, present, another, viable, approach, to, building, compact, high, energy, accelerators, using, femtosecond, duration, laser, pulses, an, electron, accelerating, gradient, 0, 69, gev, m, was, recorded, for, dielectric, laser, accelerators, higher, gradients, of, the, order, of, 1, to, 6, gev, m, are, anticipated, after, further, optimizations, advanced, accelerator, concepts, encompasses, methods, of, beam, acceleration, with, gradients, beyond, state, of, the, art, in, operational, facilities, this, includes, diagnostics, methods, timing, technology, special, needs, for, injectors, beam, matching, beam, dynamics, and, development, of, adequate, simulations, workshops, dedicated, to, this, subject, are, being, held, in, the, us, alternating, locations, and, in, europe, mostly, on, isola, d, elba, the, series, of, advanced, accelerator, concepts, workshops, held, in, the, us, started, as, an, international, series, in, 1982, the, european, advanced, accelerator, concepts, workshop, series, started, in, 2019, topics, related, to, advanced, accelerator, concepts, according, to, the, inverse, scattering, problem, any, mechanism, by, which, a, particle, produces, radiation, where, kinetic, energy, of, the, particle, is, transferred, to, the, electromagnetic, field, can, be, inverted, such, that, the, same, radiation, mechanism, leads, to, the, acceleration, of, the, particle, energy, of, the, radiation, field, is, transferred, to, kinetic, energy, of, the, particle, the, opposite, is, also, true, any, acceleration, mechanism, can, be, inverted, to, deposit, the, energy, of, the, particle, into, a, decelerating, field, like, in, a, kinetic, energy, recovery, system, this, is, the, idea, enabling, an, energy, recovery, linac, this, principle, which, is, also, behind, the, plasma, or, dielectric, wakefield, accelerrators, led, to, a, few, other, interesting, developments, in, advanced, accelerator, concepts, in, the, future, the, possibility, of, a, black, hole, production, at, the, highest, energy, accelerators, may, arise, if, certain, predictions, of, superstring, theory, are, accurate, this, and, other, possibilities, have, led, to, public, safety, concerns, that, have, been, widely, reported, in, connection, with, the, lhc, which, began, operation, in, 2008, the, various, possible, dangerous, scenarios, have, been, assessed, as, presenting, no, conceivable, danger, in, the, latest, risk, assessment, produced, by, the, lhc, safety, assessment, group, if, black, holes, are, produced, it, is, theoretically, predicted, that, such, small, black, holes, should, evaporate, extremely, quickly, via, bekenstein, hawking, radiation, but, which, is, as, yet, experimentally, unconfirmed, if, colliders, can, produce, black, holes, cosmic, rays, and, particularly, ultra, high, energy, cosmic, rays, uhecrs, must, have, been, producing, them, for, eons, but, they, have, yet, to, harm, anybody, it, has, been, argued, that, to, conserve, energy, and, momentum, any, black, holes, created, in, a, collision, between, an, uhecr, and, local, matter, would, necessarily, be, produced, moving, at, relativistic, speed, with, respect, to, the, earth, and, should, escape, into, space, as, their, accretion, and, growth, rate, should, be, very, slow, while, black, holes, produced, in, colliders, with, components, of, equal, mass, would, have, some, chance, of, having, a, velocity, less, than, earth, escape, velocity, 11, 2, km, per, sec, and, would, be, liable, to, capture, and, subsequent, growth, yet, even, on, such, scenarios, the, collisions, of, uhecrs, with, white, dwarfs, and, neutron, stars, would, lead, to, their, rapid, destruction, but, these, bodies, are, observed, to, be, common, astronomical, objects, thus, if, stable, micro, black, holes, should, be, produced, they, must, grow, far, too, slowly, to, cause, any, noticeable, macroscopic, effects, within, the, natural, lifetime, of, the, solar, system, the, use, of, advanced, technologies, such, as, superconductivity, cryogenics, and, high, powered, radiofrequency, amplifiers, as, well, as, the, presence, of, ionizing, radiation, pose, challenges, for, the, safe, operation, of, accelerator, facilities, an, accelerator, operator, controls, the, operation, of, a, particle, accelerator, adjusts, operating, parameters, such, as, aspect, ratio, current, intensity, and, position, on, target, they, communicate, with, and, assist, accelerator, maintenance, personnel, to, ensure, readiness, of, support, systems, such, as, vacuum, magnets, magnetic, and, radiofrequency, power, supplies, and, controls, and, cooling, systems, additionally, the, accelerator, operator, maintains, a, record, of, accelerator, related, events
