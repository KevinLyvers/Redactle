the, rutherford, scattering, experiments, were, a, landmark, series, of, experiments, by, which, scientists, learned, that, every, atom, has, a, nucleus, where, all, of, its, positive, charge, and, most, of, its, mass, is, concentrated, they, deduced, this, after, measuring, how, an, alpha, particle, beam, is, scattered, when, it, strikes, a, thin, metal, foil, the, experiments, were, performed, between, 1906, and, 1913, by, hans, geiger, and, ernest, marsden, under, the, direction, of, ernest, rutherford, at, the, physical, laboratories, of, the, university, of, manchester, the, physical, phenomenon, was, explained, by, ernest, rutherford, in, a, classic, 1911, paper, that, eventually, lead, to, the, widespread, use, of, scattering, in, particle, physics, to, study, subatomic, matter, rutherford, scattering, or, coulomb, scattering, is, the, elastic, scattering, of, charged, particles, by, the, coulomb, interaction, the, paper, also, initiated, the, development, of, the, planetary, rutherford, model, of, the, atom, and, eventually, the, bohr, model, rutherford, scattering, is, now, exploited, by, the, materials, science, community, in, an, analytical, technique, called, rutherford, backscattering, the, prevailing, model, of, atomic, structure, before, rutherford, s, experiments, was, devised, by, j, j, thomson, 123, thomson, had, discovered, the, electron, through, his, work, on, cathode, rays, and, between, 1897, and, 1904, he, developed, a, model, for, atoms, containing, electrons, arranged, in, concentric, shells, to, explain, why, atoms, are, electrically, neutral, he, proposed, the, existence, of, a, commensurate, amount, of, positive, charge, that, balanced, the, negative, charge, of, the, electrons, having, no, idea, what, the, source, of, this, positive, charge, was, he, tentatively, proposed, that, the, positive, charge, was, everywhere, in, the, atom, adopting, a, spherical, shape, for, simplicity, 123, thomson, thought, of, the, positive, sphere, as, being, akin, to, a, liquid, in, that, the, electrons, could, move, about, in, it, their, arrangement, and, movements, being, determined, by, the, balance, of, electrostatic, forces, thomson, was, not, quite, satisfied, with, this, simplistic, idea, and, hoped, to, dispense, with, it, as, he, refined, his, model, thomson, was, never, able, to, develop, a, complete, and, stable, model, that, could, predict, any, of, the, other, known, properties, of, the, atom, such, as, emission, spectra, and, valencies, the, japanese, scientist, hantaro, nagaoka, rejected, thomson, s, model, on, the, grounds, that, opposing, charges, cannot, penetrate, each, other, he, proposed, instead, that, electrons, orbit, the, positive, charge, like, the, rings, around, saturn, however, this, model, was, also, known, to, be, unstable, 303, an, alpha, particle, is, a, positively, charged, particle, of, matter, that, is, spontaneously, emitted, from, certain, radioactive, elements, alpha, particles, are, so, tiny, as, to, be, invisible, but, they, can, be, detected, with, the, use, of, phosphorescent, screens, photographic, plates, or, electrodes, rutherford, discovered, them, in, 1899, in, 1906, by, studying, how, alpha, particle, beams, are, deflected, by, magnetic, and, electric, fields, he, deduced, that, they, were, essentially, helium, atoms, stripped, of, their, electrons, because, they, had, the, same, charge, to, mass, ratio, and, atomic, weight, thomson, and, rutherford, knew, nothing, about, the, internal, structure, of, alpha, particles, prior, to, 1911, they, were, thought, to, have, a, diameter, similar, to, helium, atoms, 280, thomson, s, model, was, consistent, with, the, experimental, evidence, available, at, the, time, thomson, studied, beta, particle, scattering, which, showed, small, angle, deflections, modeled, as, interaction, of, the, particle, with, many, atoms, in, succession, each, interaction, of, the, particle, with, the, electrons, of, the, atom, and, the, positive, background, sphere, would, lead, to, a, tiny, deflection, but, many, such, collisions, could, add, up, 274, the, scattering, of, alpha, particles, was, expected, to, be, similar, 281, rutherford, s, team, would, show, that, the, multiple, scattering, model, was, not, needed, single, scattering, from, a, compact, charge, at, the, center, of, the, atom, would, account, for, all, of, the, scattering, data, 289, ernest, rutherford, was, langworthy, professor, of, physics, at, the, victoria, university, of, manchester, 188, now, the, university, of, manchester, he, had, already, received, numerous, honours, for, his, studies, of, radiation, he, had, discovered, the, existence, of, alpha, rays, beta, rays, and, gamma, rays, and, had, proved, that, these, were, the, consequence, of, the, disintegration, of, atoms, in, 1906, he, received, a, visit, from, a, german, physicist, named, hans, geiger, and, was, so, impressed, that, he, asked, geiger, to, stay, and, help, him, with, his, research, ernest, marsden, was, a, physics, undergraduate, student, studying, under, geiger, in, 1908, rutherford, sought, to, independently, determine, the, charge, and, mass, of, alpha, particles, to, do, this, he, wanted, to, count, the, number, of, alpha, particles, and, measure, their, total, charge, the, ratio, would, give, the, charge, of, a, single, alpha, particle, alpha, particles, are, so, tiny, as, to, be, individually, invisible, but, rutherford, knew, from, work, by, j, s, townsend, in, 1902, that, alpha, particles, ionize, air, molecules, and, if, the, air, is, within, a, strong, electric, field, each, ion, will, produce, a, cascade, of, ions, giving, a, pulse, of, electric, current, on, this, principle, rutherford, and, geiger, designed, a, simple, counting, device, which, consisted, of, two, electrodes, in, a, glass, tube, see, 1908, experiment, every, alpha, particle, that, passed, through, the, tube, would, create, a, pulse, of, electricity, that, could, be, counted, it, was, an, early, version, of, the, geiger, counter, 261, the, counter, that, geiger, and, rutherford, built, proved, unreliable, because, the, alpha, particles, were, being, too, strongly, deflected, by, their, collisions, with, the, molecules, of, air, within, the, detection, chamber, the, highly, variable, trajectories, of, the, alpha, particles, meant, that, they, did, not, all, generate, the, same, number, of, ions, as, they, passed, through, the, gas, thus, producing, erratic, readings, this, puzzled, rutherford, because, he, had, thought, that, alpha, particles, were, just, too, heavy, to, be, deflected, so, strongly, rutherford, asked, geiger, to, investigate, just, how, far, matter, could, scatter, alpha, rays, the, experiments, they, designed, involved, bombarding, a, metal, foil, with, a, beam, of, alpha, particles, to, observe, how, the, foil, scattered, them, in, relation, to, its, thickness, and, material, they, used, a, phosphorescent, screen, to, measure, the, trajectories, of, the, particles, each, impact, of, an, alpha, particle, on, the, screen, produced, a, tiny, flash, of, light, geiger, worked, in, a, darkened, lab, for, hours, on, end, counting, these, tiny, scintillations, using, a, microscope, for, the, metal, foil, they, tested, a, variety, of, metals, but, they, favored, gold, because, they, could, make, the, foil, very, thin, as, gold, is, the, most, malleable, metal, 127, as, a, source, of, alpha, particles, rutherford, s, substance, of, choice, was, radium, a, substance, thousands, of, times, more, radioactive, than, uranium, they, had, discovered, that, the, metal, foils, could, scatter, some, alpha, particles, in, all, directions, sometimes, more, than, 90, 4, this, should, have, been, impossible, according, to, thomson, s, model, 4, it, relied, on, electron, scattering, and, the, electrons, are, too, light, to, turn, the, heavier, alpha, particle, to, the, side, this, forced, rutherford, to, revise, the, model, of, the, atom, 25, in, rutherford, s, new, model, the, positive, sphere, is, at, least, 10, 000, times, smaller, than, what, thomson, imagined, it, does, not, fill, the, entire, volume, of, the, atom, but, instead, a, tiny, nucleus, and, is, surrounded, by, a, cloud, of, electrons, that, fills, the, greater, volume, of, the, atom, rutherford, proposed, a, compact, nucleus, that, would, allow, scattering, particles, to, approach, close, to, the, concentrated, charge, 25, to, verify, his, model, rutherford, developed, a, scientific, model, to, predict, the, intensity, of, alpha, particles, at, the, different, angles, they, scattered, coming, out, of, the, gold, foil, assuming, all, of, the, positive, charge, was, concentrated, at, the, center, of, the, atom, he, also, showed, that, thomson, s, scattering, model, was, not, adequate, to, explain, the, observations, of, geiger, and, marsden, this, work, was, published, in, his, now, famous, 1911, paper, the, scattering, of, and, particles, by, matter, and, the, structure, of, the, atom, there, was, little, reaction, to, rutherford, s, now, famous, 1911, paper, in, the, first, years, 192, the, paper, was, primarily, about, alpha, particle, scattering, in, an, era, before, particle, scattering, was, a, primary, tool, for, physics, the, probability, techniques, he, used, and, confusing, collection, of, observations, involved, were, not, immediately, compelling, 304, the, first, impacts, were, to, encourage, new, focus, on, scattering, experiments, for, example, the, first, results, from, a, cloud, chamber, by, c, t, r, wilson, shows, alpha, particle, scattering, and, also, appeared, in, 1911, 302, over, time, particle, scattering, became, a, major, aspect, of, theoretical, and, experimental, physics, 443, rutherford, s, concept, of, a, cross, section, now, dominates, the, descriptions, of, experimental, particle, physics, 247, the, historian, silvan, s, schweber, suggests, that, rutherford, s, approach, marked, the, shift, to, viewing, all, interactions, and, measurements, in, physics, as, scattering, processes, xiv, after, the, nucleus, a, term, rutherford, introduces, in, 1912, 192, became, the, accepted, model, for, the, core, of, atoms, rutherford, s, analysis, of, the, scattering, of, alpha, particles, created, a, new, branch, of, physics, nuclear, physics, 223, even, rutherford, s, new, atom, model, caused, no, stir, 28, rutherford, explicitly, ignores, the, electrons, only, mentioning, hantaro, nagaoka, s, saturnian, model, of, electrons, orbiting, a, tiny, sun, a, model, that, had, been, previously, rejected, as, mechanically, unstable, by, ignoring, the, electrons, rutherford, also, ignores, any, potential, implications, for, atomic, spectroscopy, for, chemistry, 302, rutherford, himself, did, not, press, the, case, for, his, atomic, model, his, own, 1913, book, on, radioactive, substances, and, their, radiations, only, mentions, the, atom, twice, other, books, by, other, authors, around, this, time, focus, on, thomson, s, model, 446, the, impact, of, rutherford, s, nuclear, model, came, after, niels, bohr, arrived, as, a, post, doctoral, student, in, manchester, at, rutherford, s, invitation, bohr, dropped, his, work, on, the, thomson, model, in, favor, of, rutherford, s, nuclear, model, developing, the, rutherford, bohr, model, over, the, next, several, years, eventually, bohr, incorporated, early, ideas, of, quantum, mechanics, into, the, model, of, the, atom, allowing, prediction, of, electronic, spectra, and, concepts, of, chemistry, 304, hantaro, nagaoka, who, had, once, proposed, a, saturnian, model, of, the, atom, wrote, to, rutherford, from, tokyo, in, 1911, i, have, been, struck, with, the, simpleness, of, the, apparatus, you, employ, and, the, brilliant, results, you, obtain, the, astronomer, arthur, eddington, called, rutherford, s, discovery, the, most, important, scientific, achievement, since, democritus, proposed, the, atom, ages, earlier, rutherford, has, since, been, hailed, as, the, father, of, nuclear, physics, in, a, lecture, delivered, on, october, 15, 1936, at, cambridge, university, rutherford, described, his, shock, at, the, results, of, the, 1909, experiment, then, i, remember, two, or, three, days, later, geiger, coming, to, me, in, great, excitement, and, saying, we, have, been, able, to, get, some, of, the, particles, coming, backwards, it, was, quite, the, most, incredible, event, that, has, ever, happened, to, me, in, my, life, it, was, almost, as, incredible, as, if, you, fired, a, 15, inch, shell, at, a, piece, of, tissue, paper, and, it, came, back, and, hit, you, on, consideration, i, realized, that, this, scattering, backward, must, be, the, result, of, a, single, collision, and, when, i, made, calculations, i, saw, that, it, was, impossible, to, get, anything, of, that, order, of, magnitude, unless, you, took, a, system, in, which, the, greater, part, of, the, mass, of, the, atom, was, concentrated, in, a, minute, nucleus, it, was, then, that, i, had, the, idea, of, an, atom, with, a, minute, massive, centre, carrying, a, charge, rutherford, s, claim, of, surprise, makes, a, good, story, but, by, the, time, of, the, geiger, mardsen, experiment, the, result, confirmed, suspicions, rutherford, developed, from, his, many, previous, experiments, 265, rutherford, s, first, steps, towards, the, his, discovery, of, the, nature, of, the, atom, came, from, his, work, to, understand, alpha, particles, 17, 435, in, 1906, rutherford, noticed, that, alpha, particles, passing, through, sheets, of, mica, were, deflected, by, the, sheets, by, as, much, as, 2, degrees, rutherford, placed, a, radioactive, source, in, a, sealed, tube, ending, with, a, narrow, slits, followed, by, a, photographic, plate, half, of, the, slit, was, covered, by, a, thin, layer, of, mica, a, magnetic, field, around, the, tube, was, altered, every, 10, minutes, to, reject, the, effect, of, beta, rays, known, to, be, sensitive, to, magnetic, fields, the, tube, was, evacuated, to, different, amounts, and, a, series, of, images, recorded, at, the, lowest, pressure, the, image, of, the, open, slit, was, clear, while, images, of, the, mica, covered, slit, or, the, open, slit, at, higher, pressures, was, fuzzy, rutherford, explained, these, results, as, alpha, particle, scattering, 260, in, a, paper, published, in, 1906, he, already, understood, the, implications, of, the, observation, for, models, of, atoms, such, a, result, brings, out, clearly, the, fact, that, the, atoms, of, matter, must, be, the, seat, of, very, intense, electrical, forces, 145, a, 1908, paper, by, geiger, on, the, scattering, of, particles, by, matter, describes, the, following, experiment, he, constructed, a, long, glass, tube, nearly, two, meters, in, length, at, one, end, of, the, tube, was, a, quantity, of, radium, emanation, r, that, served, as, a, source, of, alpha, particles, 20, the, opposite, end, of, the, tube, was, covered, with, a, phosphorescent, screen, z, in, the, middle, of, the, tube, was, a, 0, 9, mm, wide, slit, the, alpha, particles, from, r, passed, through, the, slit, and, created, a, glowing, patch, of, light, on, the, screen, a, microscope, m, was, used, to, count, the, scintillations, on, the, screen, and, measure, their, spread, geiger, pumped, all, the, air, out, of, the, tube, so, that, the, alpha, particles, would, be, unobstructed, and, they, left, a, neat, and, tight, image, on, the, screen, that, corresponded, to, the, shape, of, the, slit, geiger, then, allowed, some, air, in, the, tube, and, the, glowing, patch, became, more, diffuse, geiger, then, pumped, out, the, air, and, placed, one, or, two, golds, foils, over, the, slit, at, aa, this, too, caused, the, patch, of, light, on, the, screen, to, become, more, spread, out, with, the, larger, spread, for, two, layers, 20, this, experiment, demonstrated, that, both, air, and, solid, matter, could, markedly, scatter, alpha, particles, 20, the, results, of, the, initial, alpha, particle, scattering, experiments, were, confusing, the, angular, spread, of, the, particle, on, the, screen, varied, greatly, with, the, shape, of, the, apparatus, and, its, internal, pressure, rutherford, suggested, that, ernest, marsden, a, physics, undergraduate, student, studying, under, geiger, should, look, for, diffusely, reflected, or, back, scattered, alpha, particles, even, though, these, were, not, expected, marsden, s, first, crude, reflector, got, results, so, geiger, helped, him, create, a, more, sophisticated, apparatus, they, were, able, to, demonstrate, that, 1, in, 8000, alpha, particle, collisions, were, diffuse, reflections, 23, although, this, fraction, was, small, it, was, much, larger, than, what, the, thomson, model, of, the, atom, could, explain, 264, these, results, where, published, in, a, 1909, paper, on, a, diffuse, reflection, of, the, particles, where, geiger, and, marsden, described, the, experiment, by, which, they, proved, that, alpha, particles, can, indeed, be, scattered, by, more, than, 90, in, their, experiment, they, prepared, a, small, conical, glass, tube, ab, containing, radium, emanation, radon, radium, a, actual, radium, and, radium, c, bismuth, 214, its, open, end, sealed, with, mica, this, was, their, alpha, particle, emitter, they, then, set, up, a, lead, plate, p, behind, which, they, placed, a, fluorescent, screen, s, the, tube, was, held, on, the, opposite, side, of, plate, such, that, the, alpha, particles, it, emitted, could, not, directly, strike, the, screen, they, noticed, a, few, scintillations, on, the, screen, because, some, alpha, particles, got, around, the, plate, by, bouncing, off, air, molecules, they, then, placed, a, metal, foil, r, to, the, side, of, the, lead, plate, they, tested, with, lead, gold, tin, aluminum, copper, silver, iron, and, platinum, they, pointed, the, tube, at, the, foil, to, see, if, the, alpha, particles, would, bounce, off, it, and, strike, the, screen, on, the, other, side, of, the, plate, and, observed, an, increase, in, the, number, of, scintillations, on, the, screen, counting, the, scintillations, they, observed, that, metals, with, higher, atomic, mass, such, as, gold, reflected, more, alpha, particles, than, lighter, ones, such, as, aluminium, 20, geiger, and, marsden, then, wanted, to, estimate, the, total, number, of, alpha, particles, that, were, being, reflected, the, previous, setup, was, unsuitable, for, doing, this, because, the, tube, contained, several, radioactive, substances, radium, plus, its, decay, products, and, thus, the, alpha, particles, emitted, had, varying, ranges, and, because, it, was, difficult, for, them, to, ascertain, at, what, rate, the, tube, was, emitting, alpha, particles, this, time, they, placed, a, small, quantity, of, radium, c, bismuth, 214, on, the, lead, plate, which, bounced, off, a, platinum, reflector, r, and, onto, the, screen, they, concluded, that, approximately, 1, in, 8, 000, of, the, alpha, particles, that, struck, the, reflector, bounced, onto, the, screen, by, measuring, the, reflection, from, thin, foils, they, showed, that, the, effect, due, to, a, volume, and, not, a, surface, effect, when, contrasted, with, the, vast, number, of, alpha, particles, that, pass, unhindered, through, a, metal, foil, this, small, number, of, large, angle, reflections, was, a, strange, result, 240, that, meant, very, large, forces, were, involved, a, 1910, paper, by, geiger, the, scattering, of, the, particles, by, matter, describes, an, experiment, by, which, he, sought, to, measure, how, the, most, probable, angle, through, which, an, alpha, particle, is, deflected, varies, with, the, material, it, passes, through, the, thickness, of, said, material, and, the, velocity, of, the, alpha, particles, he, constructed, an, airtight, glass, tube, from, which, the, air, was, pumped, out, at, one, end, was, a, bulb, b, containing, radium, emanation, radon, 222, by, means, of, mercury, the, radon, in, b, was, pumped, up, the, narrow, glass, pipe, whose, end, at, a, was, plugged, with, mica, at, the, other, end, of, the, tube, was, a, fluorescent, zinc, sulfide, screen, s, the, microscope, which, he, used, to, count, the, scintillations, on, the, screen, was, affixed, to, a, vertical, millimeter, scale, with, a, vernier, which, allowed, geiger, to, precisely, measure, where, the, flashes, of, light, appeared, on, the, screen, and, thus, calculate, the, particles, angles, of, deflection, the, alpha, particles, emitted, from, a, was, narrowed, to, a, beam, by, a, small, circular, hole, at, d, geiger, placed, a, metal, foil, in, the, path, of, the, rays, at, d, and, e, to, observe, how, the, zone, of, flashes, changed, he, tested, gold, tin, silver, copper, and, aluminium, he, could, also, vary, the, velocity, of, the, alpha, particles, by, placing, extra, sheets, of, mica, or, aluminium, at, a, from, the, measurements, he, took, geiger, came, to, the, following, conclusions, 5, considering, the, results, of, the, above, experiments, rutherford, published, a, landmark, paper, in, 1911, titled, the, scattering, of, and, particles, by, matter, and, the, structure, of, the, atom, wherein, he, showed, that, single, scattering, from, a, very, small, and, intense, electric, charge, predicts, primarily, small, angle, scattering, with, small, but, measurable, amounts, of, backscattering, 252, for, the, purpose, of, his, mathematical, calculations, he, assumed, this, central, charge, was, positive, but, he, admitted, he, could, not, prove, this, and, that, he, had, to, wait, for, other, experiments, to, develop, his, theory, 688, rutherford, developed, a, mathematical, equation, that, modeled, how, the, foil, should, scatter, the, alpha, particles, if, all, the, positive, charge, and, most, of, the, atomic, mass, was, concentrated, in, a, point, at, the, center, of, an, atom, from, the, scattering, data, rutherford, estimated, the, central, charge, q, n, to, be, about, 100, units, rutherford, s, paper, does, not, discuss, any, electron, arrangement, beyond, discussions, on, the, scattering, from, jj, thomson, s, plum, pudding, model, and, from, hantaro, nagaoka, s, saturnian, model, 303, he, shows, that, the, scattering, results, predicted, by, thomson, s, model, are, also, explained, by, single, scattering, but, that, thomson, s, model, does, not, explain, large, angle, scattering, he, says, that, nagaoka, s, model, having, a, compact, charge, would, agree, with, the, scattering, data, the, saturnian, model, had, previously, been, rejected, on, other, grounds, the, so, called, rutherford, model, of, the, atom, with, orbiting, electrons, was, not, proposed, by, rutherford, in, the, 1911, paper, 304, in, a, 1913, paper, the, laws, of, deflexion, of, particles, through, large, angles, geiger, and, marsden, describe, a, series, of, experiments, by, which, they, sought, to, experimentally, verify, rutherford, s, equation, rutherford, s, equation, predicted, that, the, number, of, scintillations, per, minute, s, that, will, be, observed, at, a, given, angle, should, be, proportional, to, 11, their, 1913, paper, describes, four, experiments, by, which, they, proved, each, of, these, four, relationships, 438, to, test, how, the, scattering, varied, with, the, angle, of, deflection, i, e, if, s, csc, 4, 2, geiger, and, marsden, built, an, apparatus, that, consisted, of, a, hollow, metal, cylinder, mounted, on, a, turntable, inside, the, cylinder, was, a, metal, foil, f, and, a, radiation, source, containing, radon, r, mounted, on, a, detached, column, t, which, allowed, the, cylinder, to, rotate, independently, the, column, was, also, a, tube, by, which, air, was, pumped, out, of, the, cylinder, a, microscope, m, with, its, objective, lens, covered, by, a, fluorescent, zinc, sulfide, screen, s, penetrated, the, wall, of, the, cylinder, and, pointed, at, the, metal, foil, they, tested, with, silver, and, gold, foils, by, turning, the, table, the, microscope, could, be, moved, a, full, circle, around, the, foil, allowing, geiger, to, observe, and, count, alpha, particles, deflected, by, up, to, 150, correcting, for, experimental, error, geiger, and, marsden, found, that, the, number, of, alpha, particles, that, are, deflected, by, a, given, angle, is, indeed, proportional, to, csc, 4, 2, geiger, and, marsden, then, tested, how, the, scattering, varied, with, the, thickness, of, the, foil, i, e, if, s, t, they, constructed, a, disc, s, with, six, holes, drilled, in, it, the, holes, were, covered, with, metal, foil, f, of, varying, thickness, or, none, for, control, this, disc, was, then, sealed, in, a, brass, ring, a, between, two, glass, plates, b, and, c, the, disc, could, be, rotated, by, means, of, a, rod, p, to, bring, each, window, in, front, of, the, alpha, particle, source, r, on, the, rear, glass, pane, was, a, zinc, sulfide, screen, z, geiger, and, marsden, found, that, the, number, of, scintillations, that, appeared, on, the, zinc, sulfide, screen, was, indeed, proportional, to, the, thickness, as, long, as, said, thickness, was, small, geiger, and, marsden, reused, the, above, apparatus, to, measure, how, the, scattering, pattern, varied, with, the, square, of, the, nuclear, charge, i, e, if, s, q, n, 2, geiger, and, marsden, did, not, know, what, the, positive, charge, of, the, nucleus, of, their, metals, were, they, had, only, just, discovered, the, nucleus, existed, at, all, but, they, assumed, it, was, proportional, to, the, atomic, weight, so, they, tested, whether, the, scattering, was, proportional, to, the, atomic, weight, squared, geiger, and, marsden, covered, the, holes, of, the, disc, with, foils, of, gold, tin, silver, copper, and, aluminum, they, measured, each, foil, s, stopping, power, by, equating, it, to, an, equivalent, thickness, of, air, they, counted, the, number, of, scintillations, per, minute, that, each, foil, produced, on, the, screen, they, divided, the, number, of, scintillations, per, minute, by, the, respective, foil, s, air, equivalent, then, divided, again, by, the, square, root, of, the, atomic, weight, geiger, and, marsden, knew, that, for, foils, of, equal, stopping, power, the, number, of, atoms, per, unit, area, is, proportional, to, the, square, root, of, the, atomic, weight, thus, for, each, metal, geiger, and, marsden, obtained, the, number, of, scintillations, that, a, fixed, number, of, atoms, produce, for, each, metal, they, then, divided, this, number, by, the, square, of, the, atomic, weight, and, found, that, the, ratios, were, more, or, less, the, same, thus, they, proved, that, s, q, n, 2, finally, geiger, and, marsden, tested, how, the, scattering, varied, with, the, velocity, of, the, alpha, particles, i, e, if, s, 1, v, 4, using, the, same, apparatus, again, they, slowed, the, alpha, particles, by, placing, extra, sheets, of, mica, in, front, of, the, alpha, particle, source, they, found, that, within, the, range, of, experimental, error, that, the, number, of, scintillations, was, indeed, proportional, to, 1, v, 4, in, his, 1911, paper, see, above, rutherford, assumed, that, the, central, charge, of, the, atom, was, positive, but, a, negative, charge, would, have, fitted, his, scattering, model, just, as, well, in, a, 1913, paper, rutherford, declared, that, the, nucleus, as, he, now, called, it, was, indeed, positively, charged, based, on, the, result, of, experiments, exploring, the, scattering, of, alpha, particles, in, various, gases, in, 1917, rutherford, and, his, assistant, william, kay, began, exploring, the, passage, of, alpha, particles, through, gases, such, as, hydrogen, and, nitrogen, in, this, experiment, they, shot, a, beam, of, alpha, particles, through, hydrogen, and, they, carefully, placed, their, detector, a, zinc, sulfide, screen, just, beyond, the, range, of, the, alpha, particles, which, were, absorbed, by, the, gas, they, nonetheless, picked, up, charged, particles, of, some, sort, causing, scintillations, on, the, screen, rutherford, interpreted, this, as, alpha, particles, knocking, the, hydrogen, nuclei, forwards, in, the, direction, of, the, beam, not, backwards, rutherford, begins, his, 1911, paper, with, a, discussion, of, thomson, s, results, on, scattering, of, beta, particles, a, form, of, radioactivity, that, results, in, high, velocity, electrons, thomson, s, model, had, electrons, circulating, inside, of, a, sphere, of, positive, charge, rutherford, highlights, the, need, for, compound, or, multiple, scattering, events, the, deflections, predicted, for, each, collision, are, much, less, than, one, degree, he, then, proposes, a, model, which, will, produce, large, deflections, on, a, single, encounter, place, all, of, the, positive, charge, at, the, center, of, the, sphere, and, ignore, the, electron, scattering, as, insignificant, the, concentrated, charge, will, explain, why, most, alpha, particles, do, not, scatter, at, all, they, miss, the, charge, altogether, and, yet, particles, that, do, hit, the, center, scatter, through, large, angles, 285, rutherford, begins, his, analysis, by, considering, a, head, on, collision, between, the, alpha, particle, and, atom, this, will, establish, the, minimum, distance, between, them, a, value, which, will, be, used, throughout, his, calculations, 670, assuming, there, are, no, external, forces, and, that, initially, the, alpha, particles, are, far, from, the, nucleus, the, inverse, square, law, between, the, charges, on, the, alpha, particle, and, nucleus, gives, the, potential, energy, gained, by, the, particle, as, it, approaches, the, nucleus, for, head, on, collisions, between, alpha, particles, and, the, nucleus, all, the, kinetic, energy, of, the, alpha, particle, is, turned, into, potential, energy, and, the, particle, stops, and, turns, back, 5, where, the, particle, stops, a, distance, r, min, displaystyle, r, text, min, the, potential, energy, matches, the, original, kinetic, energy, 620, 320, 1,

of, the, nucleus, is, not, recovered, in, these, experiments, because, the, alphas, do, not, have, enough, energy, to, penetrate, to, more, than, 27, fm, of, the, nuclear, center, as, noted, when, the, actual, radius, of, gold, is, 7, 3, fm, rutherford, s, 1911, paper, started, with, a, slightly, different, formula, suitable, for, head, on, collision, with, a, sphere, of, positive, charge, 1,

rutherford, s, time, was, to, measure, charge, in, electrostatic, units, distance, in, centimeters, force, in, dynes, and, energy, in, ergs, the, modern, convention, is, to, measure, charge, in, coulombs, distance, in, meters, force, in, newtons, and, energy, in, joules, using, coulombs, requires, using, the, coulomb, constant, k, in, the, equation, rutherford, used, b, as, the, turning, point, distance, called, r, min, above, and, r, is, the, radius, of, the, atom, the, first, term, is, the, coulomb, repulsion, used, above, this, form, assumes, the, alpha, particle, could, penetrate, the, positive, charge, at, the, time, of, rutherford, s, paper, thomson, s, plum, pudding, model, proposed, a, positive, charge, with, the, radius, of, an, atom, thousands, of, times, larger, than, the, r, min, found, above, fig, 1, shows, how, concentrated, this, potential, is, compared, to, the, size, of, the, atom, many, of, rutherford, s, results, are, expressed, in, terms, of, this, turning, point, distance, r, min, simplifying, the, results, and, limiting, the, need, for, units, to, this, calculation, of, turning, point, from, his, results, for, a, head, on, collision, rutherford, knows, that, alpha, particle, scattering, occurs, close, to, the, center, of, an, atom, at, a, radius, 10, 000, times, smaller, than, the, atom, therefore, he, ignores, the, effect, of, negative, electricity, i, e, the, electrons, furthermore, he, begins, by, assuming, no, energy, loss, in, the, collision, that, is, he, ignores, the, recoil, of, the, target, atom, he, will, revisit, each, of, these, issues, later, in, his, paper, 672, under, these, conditions, the, alpha, particle, and, atom, interact, through, a, central, force, a, physical, problem, studied, first, by, isaac, newton, a, central, force, only, acts, along, a, line, between, the, particles, and, when, the, force, varies, with, the, inverse, square, like, coulomb, force, in, this, case, a, detailed, theory, was, developed, under, the, name, of, the, kepler, problem, 76, the, well, known, solutions, to, the, kepler, problem, are, called, orbits, and, unbound, orbits, are, hyperbolas, thus, rutherford, proposed, that, the, alpha, particle, will, take, a, hyperbolic, trajectory, in, the, repulsive, force, near, the, center, of, the, atom, as, shown, in, fig, 2, to, apply, the, hyperbolic, trajectory, solutions, to, the, alpha, particle, problem, rutherford, expresses, the, parameters, of, the, hyperbola, in, terms, of, the, scattering, geometry, and, energies, he, starts, with, conservation, of,

the, positive, charge, were, concentrated, in, the, center, rutherford, computes, the, probability, of, single, scattering, from, a, compact, charge, and, demonstrates, that, it, is, 3, times, larger, than, thomson, s, multiple, scattering, probability, rutherford, completes, his, analysis, including, the, effects, of, density, and, foil, thickness, then, concludes, that, thin, foils, are, governed, by, single, scattering, not, multiple, scattering, 298, later, analysis, showed, thomson, s, scattering, model, could, not, account, for, large, scattering, the, maximum, angular, deflection, from, electron, scattering, or, from, the, positive, sphere, each, come, to, less, than, 0, 02, even, many, such, scattering, events, compounded, would, result, in, less, than, a, one, degree, average, deflection, and, a, probability, of, scattering, through, 90, of, less, than, one, in, 10, 3500, 106, rutherford, s, analysis, assumed, that, alpha, particle, trajectories, turned, at, the, center, of, the, atom, but, the, exit, velocity, was, not, reduced, 253, this, is, equivalent, to, assuming, that, the, concentrated, charge, at, the, center, had, infinite, mass, or, was, anchored, in, place, rutherford, discusses, the, limitations, of, this, assumption, by, comparing, scattering, from, lighter, atoms, like, aluminum, with, heavier, atoms, like, gold, if, the, concentrated, charge, is, lighter, it, will, recoil, from, the, interaction, gaining, momentum, while, the, alpha, particle, loses, momentum, and, consequently, slows, down, 676, modern, treatments,
