quantum, entanglement, is, the, phenomenon, of, a, group, of, particles, being, generated, interacting, or, sharing, spatial, proximity, in, such, a, way, that, the, quantum, state, of, each, particle, of, the, group, cannot, be, described, independently, of, the, state, of, the, others, including, when, the, particles, are, separated, by, a, large, distance, the, topic, of, quantum, entanglement, is, at, the, heart, of, the, disparity, between, classical, and, quantum, physics, entanglement, is, a, primary, feature, of, quantum, mechanics, not, present, in, classical, mechanics, measurements, of, physical, properties, such, as, position, momentum, spin, and, polarization, performed, on, entangled, particles, can, in, some, cases, be, found, to, be, perfectly, correlated, for, example, if, a, pair, of, entangled, particles, is, generated, such, that, their, total, spin, is, known, to, be, zero, and, one, particle, is, found, to, have, clockwise, spin, on, a, first, axis, then, the, spin, of, the, other, particle, measured, on, the, same, axis, is, found, to, be, anticlockwise, however, this, behavior, gives, rise, to, seemingly, paradoxical, effects, any, measurement, of, a, particle, s, properties, results, in, an, apparent, and, irreversible, wave, function, collapse, of, that, particle, and, changes, the, original, quantum, state, with, entangled, particles, such, measurements, affect, the, entangled, system, as, a, whole, such, phenomena, were, the, subject, of, a, 1935, paper, by, albert, einstein, boris, podolsky, and, nathan, rosen, and, several, papers, by, erwin, schr, dinger, shortly, thereafter, describing, what, came, to, be, known, as, the, epr, paradox, einstein, and, others, considered, such, behavior, impossible, as, it, violated, the, local, realism, view, of, causality, einstein, referring, to, it, as, spooky, action, at, a, distance, and, argued, that, the, accepted, formulation, of, quantum, mechanics, must, therefore, be, incomplete, later, however, the, counterintuitive, predictions, of, quantum, mechanics, were, verified, in, tests, where, polarization, or, spin, of, entangled, particles, were, measured, at, separate, locations, statistically, violating, bell, s, inequality, in, earlier, tests, it, could, not, be, ruled, out, that, the, result, at, one, point, could, have, been, subtly, transmitted, to, the, remote, point, affecting, the, outcome, at, the, second, location, however, so, called, loophole, free, bell, tests, have, since, been, performed, where, the, locations, were, sufficiently, separated, that, communications, at, the, speed, of, light, would, have, taken, longer, in, one, case, 10, 000, times, longer, than, the, interval, between, the, measurements, according, to, some, interpretations, of, quantum, mechanics, the, effect, of, one, measurement, occurs, instantly, other, interpretations, which, do, not, recognize, wavefunction, collapse, dispute, that, there, is, any, effect, at, all, however, all, interpretations, agree, that, entanglement, produces, correlation, between, the, measurements, and, that, the, mutual, information, between, the, entangled, particles, can, be, exploited, but, that, any, transmission, of, information, at, faster, than, light, speeds, is, impossible, thus, despite, popular, thought, to, the, contrary, quantum, entanglement, cannot, be, used, for, faster, than, light, communication, quantum, entanglement, has, been, demonstrated, experimentally, with, photons, electrons, top, quarks, molecules, and, even, small, diamonds, the, use, of, entanglement, in, communication, computation, and, quantum, radar, is, an, active, area, of, research, and, development, in, 1935, albert, einstein, boris, podolsky, and, nathan, rosen, published, a, paper, on, the, counterintuitive, predictions, that, quantum, mechanics, makes, for, pairs, of, objects, prepared, together, in, a, particular, way, in, this, study, the, three, formulated, the, einstein, podolsky, rosen, paradox, epr, paradox, a, thought, experiment, that, attempted, to, show, that, the, quantum, mechanical, description, of, physical, reality, given, by, wave, functions, is, not, complete, however, the, three, scientists, did, not, coin, the, word, entanglement, nor, did, they, generalize, the, special, properties, of, the, quantum, state, they, considered, following, the, epr, paper, erwin, schr, dinger, wrote, a, letter, to, einstein, in, german, in, which, he, used, the, word, verschr, nkung, translated, by, himself, as, entanglement, to, describe, the, correlations, between, two, particles, that, interact, and, then, separate, as, in, the, epr, experiment, however, schr, dinger, had, discussed, the, phenomenon, as, early, as, 1932, schr, dinger, shortly, thereafter, published, a, seminal, paper, defining, and, discussing, the, notion, of, entanglement, in, the, paper, he, recognized, the, importance, of, the, concept, and, stated, i, would, not, call, one, but, rather, the, characteristic, trait, of, quantum, mechanics, the, one, that, enforces, its, entire, departure, from, classical, lines, of, thought, like, einstein, schr, dinger, was, dissatisfied, with, the, concept, of, entanglement, because, it, seemed, to, violate, the, speed, limit, on, the, transmission, of, information, implicit, in, the, theory, of, relativity, einstein, later, famously, derided, entanglement, as, spukhafte, fernwirkung, or, spooky, action, at, a, distance, the, epr, paper, generated, significant, interest, among, physicists, which, inspired, much, discussion, about, the, foundations, of, quantum, mechanics, and, bohm, s, interpretation, in, particular, but, produced, relatively, little, other, published, work, despite, the, interest, the, weak, point, in, epr, s, argument, was, not, discovered, until, 1964, when, john, stewart, bell, proved, that, one, of, their, key, assumptions, the, principle, of, locality, as, applied, to, the, kind, of, hidden, variables, interpretation, hoped, for, by, epr, was, mathematically, inconsistent, with, the, predictions, of, quantum, theory, specifically, bell, demonstrated, an, upper, limit, seen, in, bell, s, inequality, regarding, the, strength, of, correlations, that, can, be, produced, in, any, theory, obeying, local, realism, and, showed, that, quantum, theory, predicts, violations, of, this, limit, for, certain, entangled, systems, his, inequality, is, experimentally, testable, and, there, have, been, numerous, relevant, experiments, starting, with, the, pioneering, work, of, stuart, freedman, and, john, clauser, in, 1972, and, alain, aspect, s, experiments, in, 1982, an, early, experimental, breakthrough, was, due, to, carl, kocher, who, already, in, 1967, presented, an, apparatus, in, which, two, photons, successively, emitted, from, a, calcium, atom, were, shown, to, be, entangled, the, first, case, of, entangled, visible, light, the, two, photons, passed, diametrically, positioned, parallel, polarizers, with, higher, probability, than, classically, predicted, but, with, correlations, in, quantitative, agreement, with, quantum, mechanical, calculations, he, also, showed, that, the, correlation, varied, as, the, squared, cosine, of, the, angle, between, the, polarizer, settings, and, decreased, exponentially, with, time, lag, between, emitted, photons, kocher, s, apparatus, equipped, with, better, polarizers, was, used, by, freedman, and, clauser, who, could, confirm, the, cosine, squared, dependence, and, use, it, to, demonstrate, a, violation, of, bell, s, inequality, for, a, set, of, fixed, angles, all, these, experiments, have, shown, agreement, with, quantum, mechanics, rather, than, the, principle, of, local, realism, for, decades, each, had, left, open, at, least, one, loophole, by, which, it, was, possible, to, question, the, validity, of, the, results, however, in, 2015, an, experiment, was, performed, that, simultaneously, closed, both, the, detection, and, locality, loopholes, and, was, heralded, as, loophole, free, this, experiment, ruled, out, a, large, class, of, local, realism, theories, with, certainty, aspect, writes, that, no, experiment, can, be, said, to, be, totally, loophole, free, but, he, says, the, experiments, remove, the, last, doubts, that, we, should, renounce, local, hidden, variables, and, refers, to, examples, of, remaining, loopholes, as, being, far, fetched, and, foreign, to, the, usual, way, of, reasoning, in, physics, bell, s, work, raised, the, possibility, of, using, these, super, strong, correlations, as, a, resource, for, communication, it, led, to, the, 1984, discovery, of, quantum, key, distribution, protocols, most, famously, bb84, by, charles, h, bennett, and, gilles, brassard, and, e91, by, artur, ekert, although, bb84, does, not, use, entanglement, ekert, s, protocol, uses, the, violation, of, a, bell, s, inequality, as, a, proof, of, security, in, 2022, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, was, awarded, to, alain, aspect, john, clauser, and, anton, zeilinger, for, experiments, with, entangled, photons, establishing, the, violation, of, bell, inequalities, and, pioneering, quantum, information, science, an, entangled, system, can, be, defined, to, be, one, whose, quantum, state, cannot, be, factored, as, a, product, of, states, of, its, local, constituents, that, is, to, say, they, are, not, individual, particles, but, are, an, inseparable, whole, in, entanglement, one, constituent, cannot, be, fully, described, without, considering, the, other, s, the, state, of, a, composite, system, is, always, expressible, as, a, sum, or, superposition, of, products, of, states, of, local, constituents, it, is, entangled, if, this, sum, cannot, be, written, as, a, single, product, term, quantum, systems, can, become, entangled, through, various, types, of, interactions, for, some, ways, in, which, entanglement, may, be, achieved, for, experimental, purposes, see, the, section, below, on, methods, entanglement, is, broken, when, the, entangled, particles, decohere, through, interaction, with, the, environment, for, example, when, a, measurement, is, made, as, an, example, of, entanglement, a, subatomic, particle, decays, into, an, entangled, pair, of, other, particles, the, decay, events, obey, the, various, conservation, laws, and, as, a, result, the, measurement, outcomes, of, one, daughter, particle, must, be, highly, correlated, with, the, measurement, outcomes, of, the, other, daughter, particle, so, that, the, total, momenta, angular, momenta, energy, and, so, forth, remains, roughly, the, same, before, and, after, this, process, for, instance, a, spin, zero, particle, could, decay, into, a, pair, of, spin, 1, 2, particles, since, the, total, spin, before, and, after, this, decay, must, be, zero, conservation, of, angular, momentum, whenever, the, first, particle, is, measured, to, be, spin, up, on, some, axis, the, other, when, measured, on, the, same, axis, is, always, found, to, be, spin, down, this, is, called, the, spin, anti, correlated, case, and, if, the, prior, probabilities, for, measuring, each, spin, are, equal, the, pair, is, said, to, be, in, the, singlet, state, the, above, result, may, or, may, not, be, perceived, as, surprising, a, classical, system, would, display, the, same, property, and, a, hidden, variable, theory, would, certainly, be, required, to, do, so, based, on, conservation, of, angular, momentum, in, classical, and, quantum, mechanics, alike, the, difference, is, that, a, classical, system, has, definite, values, for, all, the, observables, all, along, while, the, quantum, system, does, not, in, a, sense, to, be, discussed, below, the, quantum, system, considered, here, seems, to, acquire, a, probability, distribution, for, the, outcome, of, a, measurement, of, the, spin, along, any, axis, of, the, other, particle, upon, measurement, of, the, first, particle, this, probability, distribution, is, in, general, different, from, what, it, would, be, without, measurement, of, the, first, particle, this, may, certainly, be, perceived, as, surprising, in, the, case, of, spatially, separated, entangled, particles, the, paradox, is, that, a, measurement, made, on, either, of, the, particles, apparently, collapses, the, state, of, the, entire, entangled, system, and, does, so, instantaneously, before, any, information, about, the, measurement, result, could, have, been, communicated, to, the, other, particle, assuming, that, information, cannot, travel, faster, than, light, and, hence, assured, the, proper, outcome, of, the, measurement, of, the, other, part, of, the, entangled, pair, in, the, copenhagen, interpretation, the, result, of, a, spin, measurement, on, one, of, the, particles, is, a, collapse, of, wave, function, into, a, state, in, which, each, particle, has, a, definite, spin, either, up, or, down, along, the, axis, of, measurement, the, outcome, is, taken, to, be, random, with, each, possibility, having, a, probability, of, 50, however, if, both, spins, are, measured, along, the, same, axis, they, are, found, to, be, anti, correlated, this, means, that, the, random, outcome, of, the, measurement, made, on, one, particle, seems, to, have, been, transmitted, to, the, other, so, that, it, can, make, the, right, choice, when, it, too, is, measured, the, distance, and, timing, of, the, measurements, can, be, chosen, so, as, to, make, the, interval, between, the, two, measurements, spacelike, hence, any, causal, effect, connecting, the, events, would, have, to, travel, faster, than, light, according, to, the, principles, of, special, relativity, it, is, not, possible, for, any, information, to, travel, between, two, such, measuring, events, it, is, not, even, possible, to, say, which, of, the, measurements, came, first, for, two, spacelike, separated, events, x, 1, and, x, 2, there, are, inertial, frames, in, which, x, 1, is, first, and, others, in, which, x, 2, is, first, therefore, the, correlation, between, the, two, measurements, cannot, be, explained, as, one, measurement, determining, the, other, different, observers, would, disagree, about, the, role, of, cause, and, effect, in, fact, similar, paradoxes, can, arise, even, without, entanglement, the, position, of, a, single, particle, is, spread, out, over, space, and, two, widely, separated, detectors, attempting, to, detect, the, particle, in, two, different, places, must, instantaneously, attain, appropriate, correlation, so, that, they, do, not, both, detect, the, particle, a, possible, resolution, to, the, paradox, is, to, assume, that, quantum, theory, is, incomplete, and, the, result, of, measurements, depends, on, predetermined, hidden, variables, the, state, of, the, particles, being, measured, contains, some, hidden, variables, whose, values, effectively, determine, right, from, the, moment, of, separation, what, the, outcomes, of, the, spin, measurements, are, going, to, be, this, would, mean, that, each, particle, carries, all, the, required, information, with, it, and, nothing, needs, to, be, transmitted, from, one, particle, to, the, other, at, the, time, of, measurement, einstein, and, others, see, the, previous, section, originally, believed, this, was, the, only, way, out, of, the, paradox, and, the, accepted, quantum, mechanical, description, with, a, random, measurement, outcome, must, be, incomplete, local, hidden, variable, theories, fail, however, when, measurements, of, the, spin, of, entangled, particles, along, different, axes, are, considered, if, a, large, number, of, pairs, of, such, measurements, are, made, on, a, large, number, of, pairs, of, entangled, particles, then, statistically, if, the, local, realist, or, hidden, variables, view, were, correct, the, results, would, always, satisfy, bell, s, inequality, a, number, of, experiments, have, shown, in, practice, that, bell, s, inequality, is, not, satisfied, however, prior, to, 2015, all, of, these, experiments, had, loophole, problems, that, were, considered, the, most, important, by, the, community, of, physicists, when, measurements, of, the, entangled, particles, are, made, in, moving, relativistic, reference, frames, in, which, each, measurement, in, its, own, relativistic, time, frame, occurs, before, the, other, the, measurement, results, remain, correlated, the, fundamental, issue, about, measuring, spin, along, different, axes, is, that, these, measurements, cannot, have, definite, values, at, the, same, time, they, are, incompatible, in, the, sense, that, these, measurements, maximum, simultaneous, precision, is, constrained, by, the, uncertainty, principle, this, is, contrary, to, what, is, found, in, classical, physics, where, any, number, of, properties, can, be, measured, simultaneously, with, arbitrary, accuracy, it, has, been, proven, mathematically, that, compatible, measurements, cannot, show, bell, inequality, violating, correlations, and, thus, entanglement, is, a, fundamentally, non, classical, phenomenon, the, first, experiment, that, verified, einstein, s, spooky, action, at, a, distance, entanglement, was, successfully, corroborated, in, a, lab, by, chien, shiung, wu, and, colleague, i, shaknov, in, 1949, and, was, published, on, new, year, s, day, in, 1950, the, result, specifically, proved, the, quantum, correlations, of, a, pair, of, photons, in, experiments, in, 2012, and, 2013, polarization, correlation, was, created, between, photons, that, never, coexisted, in, time, the, authors, claimed, that, this, result, was, achieved, by, entanglement, swapping, between, two, pairs, of, entangled, photons, after, measuring, the, polarization, of, one, photon, of, the, early, pair, and, that, it, proves, that, quantum, non, locality, applies, not, only, to, space, but, also, to, time, in, three, independent, experiments, in, 2013, it, was, shown, that, classically, communicated, separable, quantum, states, can, be, used, to, carry, entangled, states, the, first, loophole, free, bell, test, was, held, by, ronald, hanson, of, the, delft, university, of, technology, in, 2015, confirming, the, violation, of, bell, inequality, in, august, 2014, brazilian, researcher, gabriela, barreto, lemos, and, team, were, able, to, take, pictures, of, objects, using, photons, that, had, not, interacted, with, the, subjects, but, were, entangled, with, photons, that, did, interact, with, such, objects, lemos, from, the, university, of, vienna, is, confident, that, this, new, quantum, imaging, technique, could, find, application, where, low, light, imaging, is, imperative, in, fields, such, as, biological, or, medical, imaging, since, 2016, various, companies, for, example, ibm, and, microsoft, have, created, quantum, computers, that, allowed, developers, and, tech, enthusiasts, to, freely, experiment, with, concepts, of, quantum, mechanics, including, quantum, entanglement, there, is, a, fundamental, conflict, referred, to, as, the, problem, of, time, between, the, way, the, concept, of, time, is, used, in, quantum, mechanics, and, the, role, it, plays, in, general, relativity, in, standard, quantum, theories, time, acts, as, an, independent, background, through, which, states, evolve, with, the, hamiltonian, operator, acting, as, the, generator, of, infinitesimal, translations, of, quantum, states, through, time, in, contrast, general, relativity, treats, time, as, a, dynamical, variable, which, relates, directly, with, matter, and, moreover, requires, the, hamiltonian, constraint, to, vanish, in, quantized, general, relativity, the, quantum, version, of, the, hamiltonian, constraint, using, metric, variables, leads, to, the, wheeler, dewitt, equation, h, x, 0, displaystyle, hat, h, x, psi, rangle, 0, where, h, x, displaystyle, hat, h, x, is, the, hamiltonian, constraint, and, displaystyle, psi, rangle, stands, for, the, wave, function, of, the, universe, the, operator, h, displaystyle, hat, h, acts, on, the, hilbert, space, of, wave, functions, but, it, is, not, the, same, hilbert, space, as, in, the, nonrelativistic, case, this, hamiltonian, no, longer, determines, the, evolution, of, the, system, because, the, schr, dinger, equation, h, i, t, displaystyle, hat, h, psi, rangle, i, hbar, partial, over, partial, t, psi, rangle, ceases, to, be, valid, this, property, is, known, as, timelessness, various, attempts, to, incorporate, time, in, a, fully, quantum, framework, have, been, made, starting, with, the, page, and, wootters, mechanism, and, other, subsequent, proposals, the, emergence, of, time, was, also, proposed, as, arising, from, quantum, correlations, between, an, evolving, system, and, a, reference, quantum, clock, system, the, concept, of, system, time, entanglement, is, introduced, as, a, quantifier, of, the, actual, distinguishable, evolution, undergone, by, the, system, based, on, ads, cft, correspondence, mark, van, raamsdonk, suggested, that, spacetime, arises, as, an, emergent, phenomenon, of, the, quantum, degrees, of, freedom, that, are, entangled, and, live, in, the, boundary, of, the, spacetime, induced, gravity, can, emerge, from, the, entanglement, first, law, in, the, media, and, popular, science, quantum, non, locality, is, often, portrayed, as, being, equivalent, to, entanglement, while, this, is, true, for, pure, bipartite, quantum, states, in, general, entanglement, is, only, necessary, for, non, local, correlations, but, there, exist, mixed, entangled, states, that, do, not, produce, such, correlations, a, well, known, example, is, the, werner, states, that, are, entangled, for, certain, values, of, p, s, y, m, displaystyle, p, sym, but, can, always, be, described, using, local, hidden, variables, moreover, it, was, shown, that, for, arbitrary, numbers, of, particles, there, exist, states, that, are, genuinely, entangled, but, admit, a, local, model, the, mentioned, proofs, about, the, existence, of, local, models, assume, that, there, is, only, one, copy, of, the, quantum, state, available, at, a, time, if, the, particles, are, allowed, to, perform, local, measurements, on, many, copies, of, such, states, then, many, apparently, local, states, e, g, the, qubit, werner, states, can, no, longer, be, described, by, a, local, model, this, is, in, particular, true, for, all, distillable, states, however, it, remains, an, open, question, whether, all, entangled, states, become, non, local, given, sufficiently, many, copies, entanglement, of, a, state, shared, by, two, particles, is, necessary, but, not, sufficient, for, that, state, to, be, non, local, entanglement, is, more, commonly, viewed, as, an, algebraic, concept, noted, for, being, a, prerequisite, to, non, locality, as, well, as, to, quantum, teleportation, and, to, superdense, coding, whereas, non, locality, is, defined, according, to, experimental, statistics, and, is, much, more, involved, with, the, foundations, and, interpretations, of, quantum, mechanics, the, following, subsections, are, for, those, with, a, good, working, knowledge, of, the, formal, mathematical, description, of, quantum, mechanics, including, familiarity, with, the, formalism, and, theoretical, framework, developed, in, the, articles, bra, ket, notation, and, mathematical, formulation, of, quantum, mechanics, consider, two, arbitrary, quantum, systems, a, and, b, with, respective, hilbert, spaces, h, a, and, h, b, the, hilbert, space, of, the, composite, system, is, the, tensor, product, if, the, first, system, is, in, state, a, displaystyle, psi, rangle, a, and, the, second, in, state, b, displaystyle, phi, rangle, b, the, state, of, the, composite, system, is, states, of, the, composite, system, that, can, be, represented, in, this, form, are, called, separable, states, or, product, states, not, all, states, are, separable, states, and, thus, product, states, fix, a, basis, i, a, displaystyle, i, rangle, a, for, h, a, and, a, basis, j, b, displaystyle, j, rangle, b, for, h, b, the, most, general, state, in, h, a, h, b, is, of, the, form, this, state, is, separable, if, there, exist, vectors, c, i, a, c, j, b, displaystyle, so, that, c, i, j, c, i, a, c, j, b, displaystyle, c, ij, c, i, a, c, j, b, yielding, a, i, c, i, a, i, a, textstyle, psi, rangle, a, sum, i, c, i, a, i, rangle, a, and, b, j, c, j, b, j, b, textstyle, phi, rangle, b, sum, j, c, j, b, j, rangle, b, it, is, inseparable, if, for, any, vectors, c, i, a, c, j, b, displaystyle, at, least, for, one, pair, of, coordinates, c, i, a, c, j, b, displaystyle, c, i, a, c, j, b, we, have, c, i, j, c, i, a, c, j, b, displaystyle, c, ij, neq, c, i, a, c, j, b, if, a, state, is, inseparable, it, is, called, an, entangled, state, for, example, given, two, basis, vectors, 0, a, 1, a, displaystyle, 0, rangle, a, 1, rangle, a, of, h, a, and, two, basis, vectors, 0, b, 1, b, displaystyle, 0, rangle, b, 1, rangle, b, of, h, b, the, following, is, an, entangled, state, if, the, composite, system, is, in, this, state, it, is, impossible, to, attribute, to, either, system, a, or, system, b, a, definite, pure, state, another, way, to, say, this, is, that, while, the, von, neumann, entropy, of, the, whole, state, is, zero, as, it, is, for, any, pure, state, the, entropy, of, the, subsystems, is, greater, than, zero, in, this, sense, the, systems, are, entangled, this, has, specific, empirical, ramifications, for, interferometry, the, above, example, is, one, of, four, bell, states, which, are, maximally, entangled, pure, states, pure, states, of, the, h, a, h, b, space, but, which, cannot, be, separated, into, pure, states, of, each, h, a, and, h, b, now, suppose, alice, is, an, observer, for, system, a, and, bob, is, an, observer, for, system, b, if, in, the, entangled, state, given, above, alice, makes, a, measurement, in, the, 0, 1, displaystyle, 0, rangle, 1, rangle, eigenbasis, of, a, there, are, two, possible, outcomes, occurring, with, equal, probability, if, the, former, occurs, then, any, subsequent, measurement, performed, by, bob, in, the, same, basis, will, always, return, 1, if, the, latter, occurs, alice, measures, 1, then, bob, s, measurement, will, return, 0, with, certainty, thus, system, b, has, been, altered, by, alice, performing, a, local, measurement, on, system, a, this, remains, true, even, if, the, systems, a, and, b, are, spatially, separated, this, is, the, foundation, of, the, epr, paradox, the, outcome, of, alice, s, measurement, is, random, alice, cannot, decide, which, state, to, collapse, the, composite, system, into, and, therefore, cannot, transmit, information, to, bob, by, acting, on, her, system, causality, is, thus, preserved, in, this, particular, scheme, for, the, general, argument, see, no, communication, theorem, as, mentioned, above, a, state, of, a, quantum, system, is, given, by, a, unit, vector, in, a, hilbert, space, more, generally, if, one, has, less, information, about, the, system, then, one, calls, it, an, ensemble, and, describes, it, by, a, density, matrix, which, is, a, positive, semidefinite, matrix, or, a, trace, class, when, the, state, space, is, infinite, dimensional, and, has, trace, 1, again, by, the, spectral, theorem, such, a, matrix, takes, the, general, form, where, the, w, i, are, positive, valued, probabilities, they, sum, up, to, 1, the, vectors, i, are, unit, vectors, and, in, the, infinite, dimensional, case, we, would, take, the, closure, of, such, states, in, the, trace, norm, we, can, interpret, as, representing, an, ensemble, where, w, i, displaystyle, w, i, is, the, proportion, of, the, ensemble, whose, states, are, i, displaystyle, alpha, i, rangle, when, a, mixed, state, has, rank, 1, it, therefore, describes, a, pure, ensemble, when, there, is, less, than, total, information, about, the, state, of, a, quantum, system, we, need, density, matrices, to, represent, the, state, experimentally, a, mixed, ensemble, might, be, realized, as, follows, consider, a, black, box, apparatus, that, spits, electrons, towards, an, observer, the, electrons, hilbert, spaces, are, identical, the, apparatus, might, produce, electrons, that, are, all, in, the, same, state, in, this, case, the, electrons, received, by, the, observer, are, then, a, pure, ensemble, however, the, apparatus, could, produce, electrons, in, different, states, for, example, it, could, produce, two, populations, of, electrons, one, with, state, z, displaystyle, mathbf, z, rangle, with, spins, aligned, in, the, positive, z, direction, and, the, other, with, state, y, displaystyle, mathbf, y, rangle, with, spins, aligned, in, the, negative, y, direction, generally, this, is, a, mixed, ensemble, as, there, can, be, any, number, of, populations, each, corresponding, to, a, different, state, following, the, definition, above, for, a, bipartite, composite, system, mixed, states, are, just, density, matrices, on, h, a, h, b, that, is, it, has, the, general, form, where, the, w, i, are, positively, valued, probabilities, j, c, i, j, 2, 1, textstyle, sum, j, c, ij, 2, 1, and, the, vectors, are, unit, vectors, this, is, self, adjoint, and, positive, and, has, trace, 1, extending, the, definition, of, separability, from, the, pure, case, we, say, that, a, mixed, state, is, separable, if, it, can, be, written, as, 131, 132, where, the, w, i, are, positively, valued, probabilities, and, the, i, a, displaystyle, rho, i, a, s, and, i, b, displaystyle, rho, i, b, s, are, themselves, mixed, states, density, operators, on, the, subsystems, a, and, b, respectively, in, other, words, a, state, is, separable, if, it, is, a, probability, distribution, over, uncorrelated, states, or, product, states, by, writing, the, density, matrices, as, sums, of, pure, ensembles, and, expanding, we, may, assume, without, loss, of, generality, that, i, a, displaystyle, rho, i, a, and, i, b, displaystyle, rho, i, b, are, themselves, pure, ensembles, a, state, is, then, said, to, be, entangled, if, it, is, not, separable, in, general, finding, out, whether, or, not, a, mixed, state, is, entangled, is, considered, difficult, the, general, bipartite, case, has, been, shown, to, be, np, hard, for, the, 2, 2, and, 2, 3, cases, a, necessary, and, sufficient, criterion, for, separability, is, given, by, the, famous, positive, partial, transpose, ppt, condition, the, idea, of, a, reduced, density, matrix, was, introduced, by, paul, dirac, in, 1930, consider, as, above, systems, a, and, b, each, with, a, hilbert, space, h, a, h, b, let, the, state, of, the, composite, system, be, as, indicated, above, in, general, there, is, no, way, to, associate, a, pure, state, to, the, component, system, a, however, it, still, is, possible, to, associate, a, density, matrix, let, which, is, the, projection, operator, onto, this, state, the, state, of, a, is, the, partial, trace, of, t, over, the, basis, of, system, b, the, sum, occurs, over, n, b, dim, h, b, displaystyle, n, b, dim, h, b, and, i, a, displaystyle, i, a, the, identity, operator, in, h, a, displaystyle, h, a, a, is, sometimes, called, the, reduced, density, matrix, of, on, subsystem, a, colloquially, we, trace, out, system, b, to, obtain, the, reduced, density, matrix, on, a, for, example, the, reduced, density, matrix, of, a, for, the, entangled, state, discussed, above, is, this, demonstrates, that, as, expected, the, reduced, density, matrix, for, an, entangled, pure, ensemble, is, a, mixed, ensemble, also, not, surprisingly, the, density, matrix, of, a, for, the, pure, product, state, a, b, displaystyle, psi, rangle, a, otimes, phi, rangle, b, discussed, above, is, in, general, a, bipartite, pure, state, is, entangled, if, and, only, if, its, reduced, states, are, mixed, rather, than, pure, reduced, density, matrices, were, explicitly, calculated, in, different, spin, chains, with, unique, ground, state, an, example, is, the, one, dimensional, aklt, spin, chain, the, ground, state, can, be, divided, into, a, block, and, an, environment, the, reduced, density, matrix, of, the, block, is, proportional, to, a, projector, to, a, degenerate, ground, state, of, another, hamiltonian, the, reduced, density, matrix, also, was, evaluated, for, xy, spin, chains, where, it, has, full, rank, it, was, proved, that, in, the, thermodynamic, limit, the, spectrum, of, the, reduced, density, matrix, of, a, large, block, of, spins, is, an, exact, geometric, sequence, in, this, case, in, quantum, information, theory, entangled, states, are, considered, a, resource, i, e, something, costly, to, produce, and, that, allows, implementing, valuable, transformations, the, setting, in, which, this, perspective, is, most, evident, is, that, of, distant, labs, i, e, two, quantum, systems, labeled, a, and, b, on, each, of, which, arbitrary, quantum, operations, can, be, performed, but, which, do, not, interact, with, each, other, quantum, mechanically, the, only, interaction, allowed, is, the, exchange, of, classical, information, which, combined, with, the, most, general, local, quantum, operations, gives, rise, to, the, class, of, operations, called, locc, local, operations, and, classical, communication, these, operations, do, not, allow, the, production, of, entangled, states, between, systems, a, and, b, but, if, a, and, b, are, provided, with, a, supply, of, entangled, states, then, these, together, with, locc, operations, can, enable, a, larger, class, of, transformations, for, example, an, interaction, between, a, qubit, of, a, and, a, qubit, of, b, can, be, realized, by, first, teleporting, a, s, qubit, to, b, then, letting, it, interact, with, b, s, qubit, which, is, now, a, locc, operation, since, both, qubits, are, in, b, s, lab, and, then, teleporting, the, qubit, back, to, a, two, maximally, entangled, states, of, two, qubits, are, used, up, in, this, process, thus, entangled, states, are, a, resource, that, enables, the, realization, of, quantum, interactions, or, of, quantum, channels, in, a, setting, where, only, locc, are, available, but, they, are, consumed, in, the, process, there, are, other, applications, where, entanglement, can, be, seen, as, a, resource, e, g, private, communication, or, distinguishing, quantum, states, not, all, quantum, states, are, equally, valuable, as, a, resource, to, quantify, this, value, different, entanglement, measures, see, below, can, be, used, that, assign, a, numerical, value, to, each, quantum, state, however, it, is, often, interesting, to, settle, for, a, coarser, way, to, compare, quantum, states, this, gives, rise, to, different, classification, schemes, most, entanglement, classes, are, defined, based, on, whether, states, can, be, converted, to, other, states, using, locc, or, a, subclass, of, these, operations, the, smaller, the, set, of, allowed, operations, the, finer, the, classification, important, examples, are, a, different, entanglement, classification, is, based, on, what, the, quantum, correlations, present, in, a, state, allow, a, and, b, to, do, one, distinguishes, three, subsets, of, entangled, states, 1, the, non, local, states, which, produce, correlations, that, cannot, be, explained, by, a, local, hidden, variable, model, and, thus, violate, a, bell, inequality, 2, the, steerable, states, that, contain, sufficient, correlations, for, a, to, modify, steer, by, local, measurements, the, conditional, reduced, state, of, b, in, such, a, way, that, a, can, prove, to, b, that, the, state, they, possess, is, indeed, entangled, and, finally, 3, those, entangled, states, that, are, neither, non, local, nor, steerable, all, three, sets, are, non, empty, in, this, section, the, entropy, of, a, mixed, state, is, discussed, as, well, as, how, it, can, be, viewed, as, a, measure, of, quantum, entanglement, in, classical, information, theory, h, the, shannon, entropy, is, associated, to, a, probability, distribution, p, 1, p, n, displaystyle, p, 1, cdots, p, n, in, the, following, way, since, a, mixed, state, is, a, probability, distribution, over, an, ensemble, this, leads, naturally, to, the, definition, of, the, von, neumann, entropy, in, general, one, uses, the, borel, functional, calculus, to, calculate, a, non, polynomial, function, such, as, log, 2, if, the, nonnegative, operator, acts, on, a, finite, dimensional, hilbert, space, and, has, eigenvalues, 1, n, displaystyle, lambda, 1, cdots, lambda, n, log, 2, turns, out, to, be, nothing, more, than, the, operator, with, the, same, eigenvectors, but, the, eigenvalues, log, 2, 1, log, 2, n, displaystyle, log, 2, lambda, 1, cdots, log, 2, lambda, n, the, shannon, entropy, is, then, since, an, event, of, probability, 0, should, not, contribute, to, the, entropy, and, given, that, the, convention, 0, log, 0, 0, is, adopted, this, extends, to, the, infinite, dimensional, case, as, well, if, has, spectral, resolution, assume, the, same, convention, when, calculating, as, in, statistical, mechanics, the, more, uncertainty, number, of, microstates, the, system, should, possess, the, larger, the, entropy, for, example, the, entropy, of, any, pure, state, is, zero, which, is, unsurprising, since, there, is, no, uncertainty, about, a, system, in, a, pure, state, the, entropy, of, any, of, the, two, subsystems, of, the, entangled, state, discussed, above, is, log, 2, which, can, be, shown, to, be, the, maximum, entropy, for, 2, 2, mixed, states, entropy, provides, one, tool, that, can, be, used, to, quantify, entanglement, although, other, entanglement, measures, exist, if, the, overall, system, is, pure, the, entropy, of, one, subsystem, can, be, used, to, measure, its, degree, of, entanglement, with, the, other, subsystems, for, bipartite, pure, states, the, von, neumann, entropy, of, reduced, states, is, the, unique, measure, of, entanglement, in, the, sense, that, it, is, the, only, function, on, the, family, of, states, that, satisfies, certain, axioms, required, of, an, entanglement, measure, it, is, a, classical, result, that, the, shannon, entropy, achieves, its, maximum, at, and, only, at, the, uniform, probability, distribution, 1, n, 1, n, therefore, a, bipartite, pure, state, h, a, h, b, is, said, to, be, a, maximally, entangled, state, if, the, reduced, state, of, each, subsystem, of, is, the, diagonal, matrix, for, mixed, states, the, reduced, von, neumann, entropy, is, not, the, only, reasonable, entanglement, measure, as, an, aside, the, information, theoretic, definition, is, closely, related, to, entropy, in, the, sense, of, statistical, mechanics, comparing, the, two, definitions, in, the, present, context, it, is, customary, to, set, the, boltzmann, constant, k, 1, for, example, by, properties, of, the, borel, functional, calculus, we, see, that, for, any, unitary, operator, u, indeed, without, this, property, the, von, neumann, entropy, would, not, be, well, defined, in, particular, u, could, be, the, time, evolution, operator, of, the, system, i, e, where, h, is, the, hamiltonian, of, the, system, here, the, entropy, is, unchanged, r, nyi, entropy, also, can, be, used, as, a, measure, of, entanglement, entanglement, measures, quantify, the, amount, of, entanglement, in, a, often, viewed, as, a, bipartite, quantum, state, as, aforementioned, entanglement, entropy, is, the, standard, measure, of, entanglement, for, pure, states, but, no, longer, a, measure, of, entanglement, for, mixed, states, for, mixed, states, there, are, some, entanglement, measures, in, the, literature, and, no, single, one, is, standard, most, but, not, all, of, these, entanglement, measures, reduce, for, pure, states, to, entanglement, entropy, and, are, difficult, np, hard, to, compute, for, mixed, states, as, the, dimension, of, the, entangled, system, grows, the, reeh, schlieder, theorem, of, quantum, field, theory, is, sometimes, seen, as, an, analogue, of, quantum, entanglement, entanglement, has, many, applications, in, quantum, information, theory, with, the, aid, of, entanglement, otherwise, impossible, tasks, may, be, achieved, among, the, best, known, applications, of, entanglement, are, superdense, coding, and, quantum, teleportation, most, researchers, believe, that, entanglement, is, necessary, to, realize, quantum, computing, although, this, is, disputed, by, some, entanglement, is, used, in, some, protocols, of, quantum, cryptography, but, to, prove, the, security, of, quantum, key, distribution, qkd, under, standard, assumptions, does, not, require, entanglement, however, the, device, independent, security, of, qkd, is, shown, exploiting, entanglement, between, the, communication, partners, there, are, several, canonical, entangled, states, that, appear, often, in, theory, and, experiments, for, two, qubits, the, bell, states, are, these, four, pure, states, are, all, maximally, entangled, according, to, the, entropy, of, entanglement, and, form, an, orthonormal, basis, linear, algebra, of, the, hilbert, space, of, the, two, qubits, they, play, a, fundamental, role, in, bell, s, theorem, for, m, 2, qubits, the, ghz, state, is, which, reduces, to, the, bell, state, displaystyle, phi, rangle, for, m, 2, displaystyle, m, 2, the, traditional, ghz, state, was, defined, for, m, 3, displaystyle, m, 3, ghz, states, are, occasionally, extended, to, qudits, i, e, systems, of, d, rather, than, 2, dimensions, also, for, m, 2, qubits, there, are, spin, squeezed, states, a, class, of, squeezed, coherent, states, satisfying, certain, restrictions, on, the, uncertainty, of, spin, measurements, which, are, necessarily, entangled, spin, squeezed, states, are, good, candidates, for, enhancing, precision, measurements, using, quantum, entanglement, for, two, bosonic, modes, a, noon, state, is, this, is, like, the, bell, state, displaystyle, psi, rangle, except, the, basis, kets, 0, and, 1, have, been, replaced, with, the, n, photons, are, in, one, mode, and, the, n, photons, are, in, the, other, mode, finally, there, also, exist, twin, fock, states, for, bosonic, modes, which, can, be, created, by, feeding, a, fock, state, into, two, arms, leading, to, a, beam, splitter, they, are, the, sum, of, multiple, of, noon, states, and, can, be, used, to, achieve, the, heisenberg, limit, for, the, appropriately, chosen, measures, of, entanglement, bell, ghz, and, noon, states, are, maximally, entangled, while, spin, squeezed, and, twin, fock, states, are, only, partially, entangled, the, partially, entangled, states, are, generally, easier, to, prepare, experimentally, entanglement, is, usually, created, by, direct, interactions, between, subatomic, particles, these, interactions, can, take, numerous, forms, one, of, the, most, commonly, used, methods, is, spontaneous, parametric, down, conversion, to, generate, a, pair, of, photons, entangled, in, polarization, other, methods, include, the, use, of, a, fiber, coupler, to, confine, and, mix, photons, photons, emitted, from, decay, cascade, of, the, bi, exciton, in, a, quantum, dot, the, use, of, the, hong, ou, mandel, effect, etc, quantum, entanglement, of, a, particle, and, its, antiparticle, such, as, an, electron, and, a, positron, can, be, created, by, partial, overlap, of, the, corresponding, quantum, wave, functions, in, hardy, s, interferometer, in, the, earliest, tests, of, bell, s, theorem, the, entangled, particles, were, generated, using, atomic, cascades, it, is, also, possible, to, create, entanglement, between, quantum, systems, that, never, directly, interacted, through, the, use, of, entanglement, swapping, two, independently, prepared, identical, particles, may, also, be, entangled, if, their, wave, functions, merely, spatially, overlap, at, least, partially, a, density, matrix, is, called, separable, if, it, can, be, written, as, a, convex, sum, of, product, states, namely, j, p, j, j, a, j, b, displaystyle, rho, sum, j, p, j, rho, j, a, otimes, rho, j, b, with, 0, p, j, 1, displaystyle, 0, leq, p, j, leq, 1, probabilities, by, definition, a, state, is, entangled, if, it, is, not, separable, for, 2, qubit, and, qubit, qutrit, systems, 2, 2, and, 2, 3, respectively, the, simple, peres, horodecki, criterion, provides, both, a, necessary, and, a, sufficient, criterion, for, separability, and, thus, inadvertently, for, detecting, entanglement, however, for, the, general, case, the, criterion, is, merely, a, necessary, one, for, separability, as, the, problem, becomes, np, hard, when, generalized, other, separability, criteria, include, but, not, limited, to, the, range, criterion, reduction, criterion, and, those, based, on, uncertainty, relations, see, ref, for, a, review, of, separability, criteria, in, discrete, variable, systems, and, ref, for, a, review, on, techniques, and, challenges, in, experimental, entanglement, certification, in, discrete, variable, systems, a, numerical, approach, to, the, problem, is, suggested, by, jon, magne, leinaas, jan, myrheim, and, eirik, ovrum, in, their, paper, geometrical, aspects, of, entanglement, leinaas, et, al, offer, a, numerical, approach, iteratively, refining, an, estimated, separable, state, towards, the, target, state, to, be, tested, and, checking, if, the, target, state, can, indeed, be, reached, an, implementation, of, the, algorithm, including, a, built, in, peres, horodecki, criterion, testing, is, stateseparator, web, app, in, continuous, variable, systems, the, peres, horodecki, criterion, also, applies, specifically, simon, formulated, a, particular, version, of, the, peres, horodecki, criterion, in, terms, of, the, second, order, moments, of, canonical, operators, and, showed, that, it, is, necessary, and, sufficient, for, 1, 1, displaystyle, 1, oplus, 1, mode, gaussian, states, see, ref, for, a, seemingly, different, but, essentially, equivalent, approach, it, was, later, found, that, simon, s, condition, is, also, necessary, and, sufficient, for, 1, n, displaystyle, 1, oplus, n, mode, gaussian, states, but, no, longer, sufficient, for, 2, 2, displaystyle, 2, oplus, 2, mode, gaussian, states, simon, s, condition, can, be, generalized, by, taking, into, account, the, higher, order, moments, of, canonical, operators, or, by, using, entropic, measures, on, august, 16, 2016, the, world, s, first, quantum, communications, satellite, was, launched, from, the, jiuquan, satellite, launch, center, in, china, the, quantum, experiments, at, space, scale, quess, mission, nicknamed, micius, after, the, ancient, chinese, philosopher, the, satellite, was, intended, to, demonstrate, the, feasibility, of, quantum, communication, between, earth, and, space, and, test, quantum, entanglement, over, unprecedented, distances, in, the, 16, june, 2017, issue, of, science, yin, et, al, report, setting, a, new, quantum, entanglement, distance, record, of, 1, 203, km, demonstrating, the, survival, of, a, two, photon, pair, and, a, violation, of, a, bell, inequality, reaching, a, chsh, valuation, of, 2, 37, 0, 09, under, strict, einstein, locality, conditions, from, the, micius, satellite, to, bases, in, lijian, yunnan, and, delingha, quinhai, increasing, the, efficiency, of, transmission, over, prior, fiberoptic, experiments, by, an, order, of, magnitude, the, electron, shells, of, multi, electron, atoms, always, consist, of, entangled, electrons, the, correct, ionization, energy, can, be, calculated, only, by, consideration, of, electron, entanglement, in, 2020, researchers, reported, the, quantum, entanglement, between, the, motion, of, a, millimeter, sized, mechanical, oscillator, and, a, disparate, distant, spin, system, of, a, cloud, of, atoms, later, work, complemented, this, work, by, quantum, entangling, two, mechanical, oscillators, in, october, 2018, physicists, reported, producing, quantum, entanglement, using, living, organisms, particularly, between, photosynthetic, molecules, within, living, bacteria, and, quantized, light, living, organisms, green, sulphur, bacteria, have, been, studied, as, mediators, to, create, quantum, entanglement, between, otherwise, non, interacting, light, modes, showing, high, entanglement, between, light, and, bacterial, modes, and, to, some, extent, even, entanglement, within, the, bacteria
