moderately, toxic, for, small, animals, highly, toxic, to, large, animals, and, humans, in, high, concentrations, may, be, fatal, lethal, or, cause, blindness, and, damage, to, the, liver, kidneys, and, heart, if, swallowed, toxicity, effects, from, repeated, over, exposure, have, an, accumulative, effect, on, the, central, nervous, system, especially, the, optic, nerve, symptoms, may, be, delayed, become, severe, after, 12, to, 18, hours, and, linger, for, several, days, after, exposure, 385, c, 725, f, 658, k, methanol, also, called, methyl, alcohol, and, wood, spirit, amongst, other, names, is, an, organic, chemical, compound, and, the, simplest, aliphatic, alcohol, with, the, chemical, formula, c, h, 3, o, h, a, methyl, group, linked, to, a, hydroxyl, group, often, abbreviated, as, meoh, it, is, a, light, volatile, colorless, and, flammable, liquid, with, a, distinctive, alcoholic, odor, similar, to, that, of, ethanol, potable, alcohol, but, is, more, acutely, toxic, than, the, latter, methanol, acquired, the, name, wood, alcohol, because, it, was, once, produced, chiefly, by, the, destructive, distillation, of, wood, today, methanol, is, mainly, produced, industrially, by, hydrogenation, of, carbon, monoxide, methanol, consists, of, a, methyl, group, linked, to, a, polar, hydroxyl, group, with, more, than, 20, million, tons, produced, annually, it, is, used, as, a, precursor, to, other, commodity, chemicals, including, formaldehyde, acetic, acid, methyl, tert, butyl, ether, methyl, benzoate, anisole, peroxyacids, as, well, as, a, host, of, more, specialised, chemicals, small, amounts, of, methanol, are, present, in, normal, healthy, human, individuals, one, study, found, a, mean, of, 4, 5, ppm, in, the, exhaled, breath, of, test, subjects, the, mean, endogenous, methanol, in, humans, of, 0, 45, g, d, may, be, metabolized, from, pectin, found, in, fruit, one, kilogram, of, apple, produces, up, to, 1, 4, g, of, pectin, 0, 6, g, of, methanol, methanol, is, produced, by, anaerobic, bacteria, and, phytoplankton, methanol, is, also, found, in, abundant, quantities, in, star, forming, regions, of, space, and, is, used, in, astronomy, as, a, marker, for, such, regions, it, is, detected, through, its, spectral, emission, lines, in, 2006, astronomers, using, the, merlin, array, of, radio, telescopes, at, jodrell, bank, observatory, discovered, a, large, cloud, of, methanol, in, space, 0, 463, terametres, 288, million, miles, across, in, 2016, astronomers, detected, methanol, in, a, planet, forming, disc, around, the, young, star, tw, hydrae, using, the, atacama, large, millimeter, array, radio, telescope, in, their, embalming, process, the, ancient, egyptians, used, a, mixture, of, substances, including, methanol, which, they, obtained, from, the, pyrolysis, of, wood, pure, methanol, however, was, first, isolated, in, 1661, by, robert, boyle, when, he, produced, it, via, the, distillation, of, buxus, boxwood, it, later, became, known, as, pyroxylic, spirit, in, 1834, the, french, chemists, jean, baptiste, dumas, and, eugene, peligot, determined, its, elemental, composition, they, also, introduced, the, word, methyl, ne, to, organic, chemistry, forming, it, from, greek, methy, alcoholic, liquid, h, l, forest, wood, timber, material, methyl, ne, designated, a, radical, that, was, about, 14, hydrogen, by, weight, and, contained, one, carbon, atom, this, would, be, ch, 2, but, at, the, time, carbon, was, thought, to, have, an, atomic, weight, only, six, times, that, of, hydrogen, so, they, gave, the, formula, as, ch, they, then, called, wood, alcohol, l, esprit, de, bois, bihydrate, de, m, thyl, ne, bihydrate, because, they, thought, the, formula, was, c, 4, h, 8, o, 4, or, ch, 4, h, 2, o, 2, the, term, methyl, was, derived, in, about, 1840, by, back, formation, from, methylene, and, was, then, applied, to, describe, methyl, alcohol, this, was, shortened, to, methanol, in, 1892, by, the, international, conference, on, chemical, nomenclature, the, suffix, yl, which, in, organic, chemistry, forms, names, of, carbon, groups, is, from, the, word, methyl, french, chemist, paul, sabatier, presented, the, first, process, that, could, be, used, to, produce, methanol, synthetically, in, 1905, this, process, suggested, that, carbon, dioxide, and, hydrogen, could, be, reacted, to, produce, methanol, german, chemists, alwin, mittasch, and, mathias, pier, working, for, badische, anilin, soda, fabrik, basf, developed, a, means, to, convert, synthesis, gas, a, mixture, of, carbon, monoxide, carbon, dioxide, and, hydrogen, into, methanol, and, received, a, patent, according, to, bozzano, and, manenti, basf, s, process, was, first, utilized, in, leuna, germany, in, 1923, operating, conditions, consisted, of, high, temperatures, between, 300, and, 400, c, and, pressures, between, 250, and, 350, atm, with, a, zinc, chromium, oxide, catalyst, us, patent, 1, 569, 775, us, 1569775, was, applied, for, on, 4, september, 1924, and, issued, on, 12, january, 1926, to, basf, the, process, used, a, chromium, and, manganese, oxide, catalyst, with, extremely, vigorous, conditions, pressures, ranging, from, 50, to, 220, atm, and, temperatures, up, to, 450, c, modern, methanol, production, has, been, made, more, efficient, through, use, of, catalysts, commonly, copper, capable, of, operating, at, lower, pressures, the, modern, low, pressure, methanol, lpm, process, was, developed, by, ici, in, the, late, 1960s, us, 3326956, with, the, technology, patent, long, since, expired, during, world, war, ii, methanol, was, used, as, a, fuel, in, several, german, military, rocket, designs, under, the, name, m, stoff, and, in, a, roughly, 50, 50, mixture, with, hydrazine, known, as, c, stoff, the, use, of, methanol, as, a, motor, fuel, received, attention, during, the, oil, crises, of, the, 1970s, by, the, mid, 1990s, over, 20, 000, methanol, flexible, fuel, vehicles, ffv, capable, of, operating, on, methanol, or, gasoline, were, introduced, in, the, us, in, addition, low, levels, of, methanol, were, blended, in, gasoline, fuels, sold, in, europe, during, much, of, the, 1980s, and, early, 1990s, automakers, stopped, building, methanol, ffvs, by, the, late, 1990s, switching, their, attention, to, ethanol, fueled, vehicles, while, the, methanol, ffv, program, was, a, technical, success, rising, methanol, pricing, in, the, mid, to, late, 1990s, during, a, period, of, slumping, gasoline, pump, prices, diminished, interest, in, methanol, fuels, in, the, early, 1970s, a, process, was, developed, by, mobil, for, producing, gasoline, fuel, from, methanol, between, the, 1960s, and, 1980s, methanol, emerged, as, a, precursor, to, the, feedstock, chemicals, acetic, acid, and, acetic, anhydride, these, processes, include, the, monsanto, acetic, acid, synthesis, cativa, process, and, tennessee, eastman, acetic, anhydride, process, methanol, is, primarily, converted, to, formaldehyde, which, is, widely, used, in, many, areas, especially, polymers, the, conversion, entails, oxidation, acetic, acid, can, be, produced, from, methanol, methanol, and, isobutene, are, combined, to, give, methyl, tert, butyl, ether, mtbe, mtbe, is, a, major, octane, booster, in, gasoline, condensation, of, methanol, to, produce, hydrocarbons, and, even, aromatic, systems, is, the, basis, of, several, technologies, related, to, gas, to, liquids, these, include, methanol, to, hydrocarbons, mth, methanol, to, gasoline, mtg, methanol, to, olefins, mto, and, methanol, to, propylene, mtp, these, conversions, are, catalyzed, by, zeolites, as, heterogeneous, catalysts, the, mtg, process, was, once, commercialized, at, motunui, in, new, zealand, the, european, fuel, quality, directive, allows, fuel, producers, to, blend, up, to, 3, methanol, with, an, equal, amount, of, cosolvent, with, gasoline, sold, in, europe, in, 2019, it, is, estimated, that, china, used, as, much, as, 7, million, tons, of, methanol, as, transportation, fuels, representing, over, 5, of, their, fuel, pool, methanol, is, the, precursor, to, most, simple, methylamines, methyl, halides, and, methyl, ethers, methyl, esters, are, produced, from, methanol, including, the, transesterification, of, fats, and, production, of, biodiesel, via, transesterification, methanol, is, a, promising, energy, carrier, because, as, a, liquid, it, is, easier, to, store, than, hydrogen, and, natural, gas, its, energy, density, is, however, lower, than, methane, per, kg, its, combustion, energy, density, is, 15, 6, mj, l, lhv, whereas, that, of, ethanol, is, 24, and, gasoline, is, 33, mj, l, further, advantages, for, methanol, is, its, ready, biodegradability, and, low, environmental, toxicity, it, does, not, persist, in, either, aerobic, oxygen, present, or, anaerobic, oxygen, absent, environments, the, half, life, for, methanol, in, groundwater, is, just, one, to, seven, days, while, many, common, gasoline, components, have, half, lives, in, the, hundreds, of, days, such, as, benzene, at, 10, 730, days, since, methanol, is, miscible, with, water, and, biodegradable, it, is, unlikely, to, accumulate, in, groundwater, surface, water, air, or, soil, methanol, is, occasionally, used, to, fuel, internal, combustion, engines, it, burns, forming, carbon, dioxide, and, water, methanol, fuel, has, been, proposed, for, ground, transportation, the, chief, advantage, of, a, methanol, economy, is, that, it, could, be, adapted, to, gasoline, internal, combustion, engines, with, minimum, modification, to, the, engines, and, to, the, infrastructure, that, delivers, and, stores, liquid, fuel, its, energy, density, however, is, less, than, gasoline, meaning, more, frequent, fill, ups, would, be, required, however, it, is, equivalent, to, super, high, octane, gasoline, in, horsepower, and, most, modern, computer, controlled, fuel, injection, systems, can, already, use, it, methanol, is, an, alternative, fuel, for, ships, that, helps, the, shipping, industry, meet, increasingly, strict, emissions, regulations, it, significantly, reduces, emissions, of, sulfur, oxides, sox, nitrogen, oxides, nox, and, particulate, matter, methanol, can, be, used, with, high, efficiency, in, marine, diesel, engines, after, minor, modifications, using, a, small, amount, of, pilot, fuel, dual, fuel, in, china, methanol, fuels, industrial, boilers, which, are, used, extensively, to, generate, heat, and, steam, for, various, industrial, applications, and, residential, heating, its, use, is, displacing, coal, which, is, under, pressure, from, increasingly, stringent, environmental, regulations, direct, methanol, fuel, cells, are, unique, in, their, low, temperature, atmospheric, pressure, operation, which, lets, them, be, greatly, miniaturized, this, combined, with, the, relatively, easy, and, safe, storage, and, handling, of, methanol, may, open, the, possibility, of, fuel, cell, powered, consumer, electronics, such, as, laptop, computers, and, mobile, phones, methanol, is, also, a, widely, used, fuel, in, camping, and, boating, stoves, methanol, burns, well, in, an, unpressurized, burner, so, alcohol, stoves, are, often, very, simple, sometimes, little, more, than, a, cup, to, hold, fuel, this, lack, of, complexity, makes, them, a, favorite, of, hikers, who, spend, extended, time, in, the, wilderness, similarly, the, alcohol, can, be, gelled, to, reduce, risk, of, leaking, or, spilling, as, with, the, brand, sterno, methanol, is, mixed, with, water, and, injected, into, high, performance, diesel, and, gasoline, engines, for, an, increase, of, power, and, a, decrease, in, intake, air, temperature, in, a, process, known, as, water, methanol, injection, methanol, is, used, as, a, denaturant, for, ethanol, the, product, being, known, as, denatured, alcohol, or, methylated, spirit, this, was, commonly, used, during, the, us, prohibition, to, discourage, consumption, of, bootlegged, liquor, and, ended, up, causing, several, deaths, methanol, is, used, as, a, solvent, and, as, an, antifreeze, in, pipelines, and, windshield, washer, fluid, methanol, was, used, as, an, automobile, coolant, antifreeze, in, the, early, 1900s, as, of, may, 2018, methanol, was, banned, in, the, eu, for, use, in, windscreen, washing, or, defrosting, due, to, its, risk, of, human, consumption, as, a, result, of, 2012, czech, republic, methanol, poisonings, in, some, wastewater, treatment, plants, a, small, amount, of, methanol, is, added, to, wastewater, to, provide, a, carbon, food, source, for, the, denitrifying, bacteria, which, convert, nitrates, to, nitrogen, gas, and, reduce, the, nitrification, of, sensitive, aquifers, methanol, is, used, as, a, destaining, agent, in, polyacrylamide, gel, electrophoresis, carbon, monoxide, and, hydrogen, react, over, a, catalyst, to, produce, methanol, today, the, most, widely, used, catalyst, is, a, mixture, of, copper, and, zinc, oxides, supported, on, alumina, as, first, used, by, ici, in, 1966, at, 5, 10, mpa, 50, 100, atm, and, 250, c, 482, f, the, reaction, is, characterized, by, high, selectivity, 99, 8, the, production, of, synthesis, gas, from, methane, produces, three, moles, of, hydrogen, for, every, mole, of, carbon, monoxide, whereas, the, synthesis, consumes, only, two, moles, of, hydrogen, gas, per, mole, of, carbon, monoxide, one, way, of, dealing, with, the, excess, hydrogen, is, to, inject, carbon, dioxide, into, the, methanol, synthesis, reactor, where, it, too, reacts, to, form, methanol, according, to, the, equation, in, terms, of, mechanism, the, process, occurs, via, initial, conversion, of, co, into, co, 2, which, is, then, hydrogenated, where, the, h, 2, o, byproduct, is, recycled, via, the, water, gas, shift, reaction, this, gives, an, overall, reaction, which, is, the, same, as, listed, above, in, a, process, closely, related, to, methanol, production, from, synthesis, gas, a, feed, of, hydrogen, and, co, 2, can, be, used, directly, the, main, advantage, of, this, process, is, that, captured, co, 2, and, hydrogen, sourced, from, electrolysis, could, be, used, removing, the, dependence, on, fossil, fuels, the, catalytic, conversion, of, methane, to, methanol, is, effected, by, enzymes, including, methane, monooxygenases, these, enzymes, are, mixed, function, oxygenases, i, e, oxygenation, is, coupled, with, production, of, water, and, nad, both, fe, and, cu, dependent, enzymes, have, been, characterized, intense, but, largely, fruitless, efforts, have, been, undertaken, to, emulate, this, reactivity, methanol, is, more, easily, oxidized, than, is, the, feedstock, methane, so, the, reactions, tend, not, to, be, selective, some, strategies, exist, to, circumvent, this, problem, examples, include, shilov, systems, and, fe, and, cu, containing, zeolites, these, systems, do, not, necessarily, mimic, the, mechanisms, employed, by, metalloenzymes, but, draw, some, inspiration, from, them, active, sites, can, vary, substantially, from, those, known, in, the, enzymes, for, example, a, dinuclear, active, site, is, proposed, in, the, smmo, enzyme, whereas, a, mononuclear, iron, alpha, oxygen, is, proposed, in, the, fe, zeolite, global, emissions, of, methanol, by, plants, are, estimated, at, between, 180, and, 250, million, tons, per, year, this, is, between, two, and, three, times, larger, than, man, made, industrial, production, of, methanol, as, of, 2023, 0, 2, of, global, methanol, production, is, produced, in, ways, that, have, relatively, low, greenhouse, gas, emissions, this, is, known, as, green, methanol, most, green, methanol, is, produced, from, gasification, of, biomass, syngas, is, produced, from, biomass, gasification, and, further, converted, into, green, methanol, another, method, of, producing, green, methanol, involves, combining, hydrogen, carbon, dioxide, and, a, catalyst, under, high, heat, and, pressure, to, be, classified, as, green, methanol, the, hydrogen, must, be, green, hydrogen, which, is, produced, using, renewable, electricity, additionally, the, carbon, dioxide, in, this, process, must, be, a, product, of, carbon, capture, and, storage, or, direct, air, capture, or, biomass, of, recent, origin, some, definitions, of, green, methanol, specify, that, the, carbon, dioxide, must, be, captured, during, the, burning, of, bioenergy, methanol, is, available, commercially, in, various, purity, grades, commercial, methanol, is, generally, classified, according, to, astm, purity, grades, a, and, aa, both, grade, a, and, grade, aa, purity, are, 99, 85, methanol, by, weight, grade, aa, methanol, contains, trace, amounts, of, ethanol, as, well, methanol, for, chemical, use, normally, corresponds, to, grade, aa, in, addition, to, water, typical, impurities, include, acetone, and, ethanol, which, are, very, difficult, to, separate, by, distillation, uv, vis, spectroscopy, is, a, convenient, method, for, detecting, aromatic, impurities, water, content, can, be, determined, by, the, karl, fischer, titration, methanol, is, highly, flammable, its, vapours, are, slightly, heavier, than, air, and, can, travel, to, a, distant, ignition, source, and, ignite, methanol, fires, should, be, extinguished, with, dry, chemical, carbon, dioxide, water, spray, or, alcohol, resistant, foam, methanol, flames, are, invisible, in, daylight, ingesting, as, little, as, 10, ml, 0, 34, us, fl, oz, of, pure, methanol, can, cause, permanent, blindness, by, destruction, of, the, optic, nerve, 30, ml, 1, 0, us, fl, oz, is, potentially, fatal, the, median, lethal, dose, is, 100, ml, 3, 4, us, fl, oz, i, e, 1, 2, ml, kg, body, weight, of, pure, methanol, the, reference, dose, for, methanol, is, 0, 5, mg, kg, in, a, day, toxic, effects, begin, hours, after, ingestion, and, antidotes, can, often, prevent, permanent, damage, because, of, its, similarities, in, both, appearance, and, odor, to, ethanol, the, alcohol, in, beverages, or, isopropyl, alcohol, it, is, difficult, to, differentiate, between, the, three, methanol, is, toxic, by, two, mechanisms, first, methanol, can, be, fatal, due, to, effects, on, the, central, nervous, system, acting, as, a, central, nervous, system, depressant, in, the, same, manner, as, ethanol, poisoning, second, in, a, process, of, toxication, it, is, metabolised, to, formic, acid, which, is, present, as, the, formate, ion, via, formaldehyde, in, a, process, initiated, by, the, enzyme, alcohol, dehydrogenase, in, the, liver, methanol, is, converted, to, formaldehyde, via, alcohol, dehydrogenase, adh, and, formaldehyde, is, converted, to, formic, acid, formate, via, aldehyde, dehydrogenase, aldh, the, conversion, to, formate, via, aldh, proceeds, completely, with, no, detectable, formaldehyde, remaining, formate, is, toxic, because, it, inhibits, mitochondrial, cytochrome, c, oxidase, causing, hypoxia, at, the, cellular, level, and, metabolic, acidosis, among, a, variety, of, other, metabolic, disturbances, outbreaks, of, methanol, poisoning, have, occurred, primarily, due, to, contamination, of, drinking, alcohol, this, is, more, common, in, the, developing, world, in, 2013, more, than, 1700, cases, nonetheless, occurred, in, the, united, states, those, affected, are, often, adult, men, outcomes, may, be, good, with, early, treatment, toxicity, to, methanol, was, described, as, early, as, 1856, because, of, its, toxic, properties, methanol, is, frequently, used, as, a, denaturant, additive, for, ethanol, manufactured, for, industrial, uses, this, addition, of, methanol, exempts, industrial, ethanol, commonly, known, as, denatured, alcohol, or, methylated, spirit, from, liquor, excise, taxation, in, the, us, and, other, countries
