medicinal, or, pharmaceutical, chemistry, is, a, scientific, discipline, at, the, intersection, of, chemistry, and, pharmacy, involved, with, designing, and, developing, pharmaceutical, drugs, medicinal, chemistry, involves, the, identification, synthesis, and, development, of, new, chemical, entities, suitable, for, therapeutic, use, it, also, includes, the, study, of, existing, drugs, their, biological, properties, and, their, quantitative, structure, activity, relationships, qsar, medicinal, chemistry, is, a, highly, interdisciplinary, science, combining, organic, chemistry, with, biochemistry, computational, chemistry, pharmacology, molecular, biology, statistics, and, physical, chemistry, compounds, used, as, medicines, are, most, often, organic, compounds, which, are, often, divided, into, the, broad, classes, of, small, organic, molecules, e, g, atorvastatin, fluticasone, clopidogrel, and, biologics, infliximab, erythropoietin, insulin, glargine, the, latter, of, which, are, most, often, medicinal, preparations, of, proteins, natural, and, recombinant, antibodies, hormones, etc, medicines, can, also, be, inorganic, and, organometallic, compounds, commonly, referred, to, as, metallodrugs, e, g, platinum, lithium, and, gallium, based, agents, such, as, cisplatin, lithium, carbonate, and, gallium, nitrate, respectively, the, discipline, of, medicinal, inorganic, chemistry, investigates, the, role, of, metals, in, medicine, metallotherapeutics, which, involves, the, study, and, treatment, of, diseases, and, health, conditions, associated, with, inorganic, metals, in, biological, systems, there, are, several, metallotherapeutics, approved, for, the, treatment, of, cancer, e, g, contain, pt, ru, gd, ti, ge, v, and, ga, antimicrobials, e, g, ag, cu, and, ru, diabetes, e, g, v, and, cr, broad, spectrum, antibiotic, e, g, bi, bipolar, disorder, e, g, li, other, areas, of, study, include, metallomics, genomics, proteomics, diagnostic, agents, e, g, mri, gd, mn, x, ray, ba, i, and, radiopharmaceuticals, e, g, 99m, tc, for, diagnostics, 186, re, for, therapeutics, in, particular, medicinal, chemistry, in, its, most, common, practice, focusing, on, small, organic, molecules, encompasses, synthetic, organic, chemistry, and, aspects, of, natural, products, and, computational, chemistry, in, close, combination, with, chemical, biology, enzymology, and, structural, biology, together, aiming, at, the, discovery, and, development, of, new, therapeutic, agents, practically, speaking, it, involves, chemical, aspects, of, identification, and, then, systematic, thorough, synthetic, alteration, of, new, chemical, entities, to, make, them, suitable, for, therapeutic, use, it, includes, synthetic, and, computational, aspects, of, the, study, of, existing, drugs, and, agents, in, development, in, relation, to, their, bioactivities, biological, activities, and, properties, i, e, understanding, their, structure, activity, relationships, sar, pharmaceutical, chemistry, is, focused, on, quality, aspects, of, medicines, and, aims, to, assure, fitness, for, purpose, of, medicinal, products, at, the, biological, interface, medicinal, chemistry, combines, to, form, a, set, of, highly, interdisciplinary, sciences, setting, its, organic, physical, and, computational, emphases, alongside, biological, areas, such, as, biochemistry, molecular, biology, pharmacognosy, and, pharmacology, toxicology, and, veterinary, and, human, medicine, these, with, project, management, statistics, and, pharmaceutical, business, practices, systematically, oversee, altering, identified, chemical, agents, such, that, after, pharmaceutical, formulation, they, are, safe, and, efficacious, and, therefore, suitable, for, use, in, treatment, of, disease, discovery, is, the, identification, of, novel, active, chemical, compounds, often, called, hits, which, are, typically, found, by, assay, of, compounds, for, a, desired, biological, activity, initial, hits, can, come, from, repurposing, existing, agents, toward, a, new, pathologic, processes, and, from, observations, of, biologic, effects, of, new, or, existing, natural, products, from, bacteria, fungi, plants, etc, in, addition, hits, also, routinely, originate, from, structural, observations, of, small, molecule, fragments, bound, to, therapeutic, targets, enzymes, receptors, etc, where, the, fragments, serve, as, starting, points, to, develop, more, chemically, complex, forms, by, synthesis, finally, hits, also, regularly, originate, from, en, masse, testing, of, chemical, compounds, against, biological, targets, using, biochemical, or, chemoproteomics, assays, where, the, compounds, may, be, from, novel, synthetic, chemical, libraries, known, to, have, particular, properties, kinase, inhibitory, activity, diversity, or, drug, likeness, etc, or, from, historic, chemical, compound, collections, or, libraries, created, through, combinatorial, chemistry, while, a, number, of, approaches, toward, the, identification, and, development, of, hits, exist, the, most, successful, techniques, are, based, on, chemical, and, biological, intuition, developed, in, team, environments, through, years, of, rigorous, practice, aimed, solely, at, discovering, new, therapeutic, agents, further, chemistry, and, analysis, is, necessary, first, to, identify, the, triage, compounds, that, do, not, provide, series, displaying, suitable, sar, and, chemical, characteristics, associated, with, long, term, potential, for, development, then, to, improve, the, remaining, hit, series, concerning, the, desired, primary, activity, as, well, as, secondary, activities, and, physiochemical, properties, such, that, the, agent, will, be, useful, when, administered, in, real, patients, in, this, regard, chemical, modifications, can, improve, the, recognition, and, binding, geometries, pharmacophores, of, the, candidate, compounds, and, so, their, affinities, for, their, targets, as, well, as, improving, the, physicochemical, properties, of, the, molecule, that, underlie, necessary, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, pk, pd, and, toxicologic, profiles, stability, toward, metabolic, degradation, lack, of, geno, hepatic, and, cardiac, toxicities, etc, such, that, the, chemical, compound, or, biologic, is, suitable, for, introduction, into, animal, and, human, studies, the, final, synthetic, chemistry, stages, involve, the, production, of, a, lead, compound, in, suitable, quantity, and, quality, to, allow, large, scale, animal, testing, and, then, human, clinical, trials, this, involves, the, optimization, of, the, synthetic, route, for, bulk, industrial, production, and, discovery, of, the, most, suitable, drug, formulation, the, former, of, these, is, still, the, bailiwick, of, medicinal, chemistry, the, latter, brings, in, the, specialization, of, formulation, science, with, its, components, of, physical, and, polymer, chemistry, and, materials, science, the, synthetic, chemistry, specialization, in, medicinal, chemistry, aimed, at, adaptation, and, optimization, of, the, synthetic, route, for, industrial, scale, syntheses, of, hundreds, of, kilograms, or, more, is, termed, process, synthesis, and, involves, thorough, knowledge, of, acceptable, synthetic, practice, in, the, context, of, large, scale, reactions, reaction, thermodynamics, economics, safety, etc, critical, at, this, stage, is, the, transition, to, more, stringent, gmp, requirements, for, material, sourcing, handling, and, chemistry, the, synthetic, methodology, employed, in, medicinal, chemistry, is, subject, to, constraints, that, do, not, apply, to, traditional, organic, synthesis, owing, to, the, prospect, of, scaling, the, preparation, safety, is, of, paramount, importance, the, potential, toxicity, of, reagents, affects, methodology, the, structures, of, pharmaceuticals, are, assessed, in, many, ways, in, part, as, a, means, to, predict, efficacy, stability, and, accessibility, lipinski, s, rule, of, five, focus, on, the, number, of, hydrogen, bond, donors, and, acceptors, number, of, rotatable, bonds, surface, area, and, lipophilicity, other, parameters, by, which, medicinal, chemists, assess, or, classify, their, compounds, are, synthetic, complexity, chirality, flatness, and, aromatic, ring, count, structural, analysis, of, lead, compounds, is, often, performed, through, computational, methods, prior, to, actual, synthesis, of, the, ligand, s, this, is, done, for, a, number, of, reasons, including, but, not, limited, to, time, and, financial, considerations, expenditure, etc, once, the, ligand, of, interest, has, been, synthesized, in, the, laboratory, analysis, is, then, performed, by, traditional, methods, tlc, nmr, gc, ms, and, others, medicinal, chemistry, is, by, nature, an, interdisciplinary, science, and, practitioners, have, a, strong, background, in, organic, chemistry, which, must, eventually, be, coupled, with, a, broad, understanding, of, biological, concepts, related, to, cellular, drug, targets, scientists, in, medicinal, chemistry, work, are, principally, industrial, scientists, but, see, following, working, as, part, of, an, interdisciplinary, team, that, uses, their, chemistry, abilities, especially, their, synthetic, abilities, to, use, chemical, principles, to, design, effective, therapeutic, agents, the, length, of, training, is, intense, with, practitioners, often, required, to, attain, a, 4, year, bachelor, s, degree, followed, by, a, 4, 6, year, ph, d, in, organic, chemistry, most, training, regimens, also, include, a, postdoctoral, fellowship, period, of, 2, or, more, years, after, receiving, a, ph, d, in, chemistry, making, the, total, length, of, training, range, from, 10, to, 12, years, of, college, education, however, employment, opportunities, at, the, master, s, level, also, exist, in, the, pharmaceutical, industry, and, at, that, and, the, ph, d, level, there, are, further, opportunities, for, employment, in, academia, and, government, graduate, level, programs, in, medicinal, chemistry, can, be, found, in, traditional, medicinal, chemistry, or, pharmaceutical, sciences, departments, both, of, which, are, traditionally, associated, with, schools, of, pharmacy, and, in, some, chemistry, departments, however, the, majority, of, working, medicinal, chemists, have, graduate, degrees, ms, but, especially, ph, d, in, organic, chemistry, rather, than, medicinal, chemistry, and, the, preponderance, of, positions, are, in, research, where, the, net, is, necessarily, cast, widest, and, most, broad, synthetic, activity, occurs, in, research, of, small, molecule, therapeutics, an, emphasis, on, training, that, provides, for, breadth, of, synthetic, experience, and, pace, of, bench, operations, is, clearly, present, e, g, for, individuals, with, pure, synthetic, organic, and, natural, products, synthesis, in, ph, d, and, post, doctoral, positions, ibid, in, the, medicinal, chemistry, specialty, areas, associated, with, the, design, and, synthesis, of, chemical, libraries, or, the, execution, of, process, chemistry, aimed, at, viable, commercial, syntheses, areas, generally, with, fewer, opportunities, training, paths, are, often, much, more, varied, e, g, including, focused, training, in, physical, organic, chemistry, library, related, syntheses, etc, as, such, most, entry, level, workers, in, medicinal, chemistry, especially, in, the, u, s, do, not, have, formal, training, in, medicinal, chemistry, but, receive, the, necessary, medicinal, chemistry, and, pharmacologic, background, after, employment, at, entry, into, their, work, in, a, pharmaceutical, company, where, the, company, provides, its, particular, understanding, or, model, of, medichem, training, through, active, involvement, in, practical, synthesis, on, therapeutic, projects, the, same, is, somewhat, true, of, computational, medicinal, chemistry, specialties, but, not, to, the, same, degree, as, in, synthetic, areas, biochemistry, and, molecular, biology, at, curlie
