peat, is, an, accumulation, of, partially, decayed, vegetation, or, organic, matter, it, is, unique, to, natural, areas, called, peatlands, bogs, mires, moors, or, muskegs, sphagnum, moss, also, called, peat, moss, is, one, of, the, most, common, components, in, peat, although, many, other, plants, can, contribute, the, biological, features, of, sphagnum, mosses, act, to, create, a, habitat, aiding, peat, formation, a, phenomenon, termed, habitat, manipulation, soils, consisting, primarily, of, peat, are, known, as, histosols, peat, forms, in, wetland, conditions, where, flooding, or, stagnant, water, obstructs, the, flow, of, oxygen, from, the, atmosphere, slowing, the, rate, of, decomposition, peat, properties, such, as, organic, matter, content, and, saturated, hydraulic, conductivity, can, exhibit, high, spatial, heterogeneity, peatlands, particularly, bogs, are, the, primary, source, of, peat, although, less, common, other, wetlands, including, fens, pocosins, and, peat, swamp, forests, also, deposit, peat, landscapes, covered, in, peat, are, home, to, specific, kinds, of, plants, including, sphagnum, moss, ericaceous, shrubs, and, sedges, because, organic, matter, accumulates, over, thousands, of, years, peat, deposits, provide, records, of, past, vegetation, and, climate, by, preserving, plant, remains, such, as, pollen, this, allows, the, reconstruction, of, past, environments, and, the, study, of, land, use, changes, peat, is, used, by, gardeners, and, for, horticulture, in, certain, parts, of, the, world, but, this, is, being, banned, in, some, places, by, volume, there, are, about, 4, trillion, cubic, metres, of, peat, in, the, world, over, time, the, formation, of, peat, is, often, the, first, step, in, the, geological, formation, of, fossil, fuels, such, as, coal, particularly, low, grade, coal, such, as, lignite, the, peatland, ecosystem, covers, 3, 7, million, square, kilometres, 1, 4, million, square, miles, and, is, the, most, efficient, carbon, sink, on, the, planet, because, peatland, plants, capture, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, naturally, released, from, the, peat, maintaining, an, equilibrium, in, natural, peatlands, the, annual, rate, of, biomass, production, is, greater, than, the, rate, of, decomposition, but, it, takes, thousands, of, years, for, peatlands, to, develop, the, deposits, of, 1, 5, to, 2, 3, m, which, is, the, average, depth, of, the, boreal, peatlands, which, store, around, 415, gigatonnes, gt, of, carbon, about, 46, times, 2019, global, co, 2, emissions, globally, peat, stores, up, to, 550, gt, of, carbon, 42, of, all, soil, carbon, which, exceeds, the, carbon, stored, in, all, other, vegetation, types, including, the, world, s, forests, although, it, covers, just, 3, of, the, land, s, surface, peat, is, not, a, renewable, source, of, energy, due, to, its, extraction, rate, in, industrialized, countries, far, exceeding, its, slow, regrowth, rate, of, 1, mm, 0, 04, in, per, year, and, as, it, is, also, reported, that, peat, regrowth, takes, place, only, in, 30, 40, of, peatlands, centuries, of, burning, and, draining, of, peat, by, humans, has, released, a, significant, amount, of, co, 2, into, the, atmosphere, and, much, peatland, restoration, is, needed, to, help, limit, climate, change, peat, forms, when, plant, material, does, not, fully, decay, in, acidic, and, anaerobic, conditions, it, is, composed, mainly, of, wetland, vegetation, principally, bog, plants, including, mosses, sedges, and, shrubs, as, it, accumulates, the, peat, holds, water, this, slowly, creates, wetter, conditions, that, allow, the, area, of, wetland, to, expand, peatland, features, can, include, ponds, ridges, and, raised, bogs, the, characteristics, of, some, bog, plants, actively, promote, bog, formation, for, example, sphagnum, mosses, actively, secrete, tannins, which, preserve, organic, material, sphagnum, also, have, special, water, retaining, cells, known, as, hyaline, cells, which, can, release, water, ensuring, the, bogland, remains, constantly, wet, which, helps, promote, peat, production, most, modern, peat, bogs, formed, 12, 000, years, ago, in, high, latitudes, after, the, glaciers, retreated, at, the, end, of, the, last, ice, age, peat, usually, accumulates, slowly, at, the, rate, of, about, a, millimetre, per, year, the, estimated, carbon, content, is, 415, gigatonnes, 457, billion, short, tons, northern, peatlands, 50, gt, 55, billion, short, tons, tropical, peatlands, and, 15, gt, 17, billion, short, tons, south, america, peat, material, is, either, fibric, hemic, or, sapric, fibric, peats, are, the, least, decomposed, and, consist, of, intact, fibre, hemic, peats, are, partially, decomposed, and, sapric, are, the, most, decomposed, phragmites, peat, are, composed, of, reed, grass, phragmites, australis, and, other, grasses, it, is, denser, than, many, other, types, of, peat, engineers, may, describe, a, soil, as, peat, which, has, a, relatively, high, percentage, of, organic, material, this, soil, is, problematic, because, it, exhibits, poor, consolidation, properties, it, cannot, be, easily, compacted, to, serve, as, a, stable, foundation, to, support, loads, such, as, roads, or, buildings, in, a, widely, cited, article, joosten, and, clarke, 2002, described, peatlands, or, mires, which, they, say, are, the, same, as, the, most, widespread, of, all, wetland, types, in, the, world, representing, 50, to, 70, of, global, wetlands, they, cover, over, 4, million, square, kilometres, or, 3, of, the, land, and, freshwater, surface, of, the, planet, in, these, ecosystems, are, found, one, third, of, the, world, s, soil, carbon, and, 10, of, global, freshwater, resources, these, ecosystems, are, characterized, by, the, unique, ability, to, accumulate, and, store, dead, organic, matter, from, sphagnum, and, many, other, non, moss, species, as, peat, under, conditions, of, almost, permanent, water, saturation, peatlands, are, adapted, to, the, extreme, conditions, of, high, water, and, low, oxygen, content, of, toxic, elements, and, low, availability, of, plant, nutrients, their, water, chemistry, varies, from, alkaline, to, acidic, peatlands, occur, on, all, continents, from, the, tropical, to, boreal, and, arctic, zones, from, sea, level, to, high, alpine, conditions, a, more, recent, estimate, from, an, improved, global, peatland, map, peatmap, based, on, a, meta, analysis, of, geospatial, information, at, global, regional, and, national, levels, puts, global, coverage, slightly, higher, than, earlier, peatland, inventories, at, 4, 23, million, square, kilometres, 1, 63, million, square, miles, approximately, 2, 84, of, the, world, land, area, in, europe, peatlands, extend, to, about, 515, 000, km, 2, 199, 000, sq, mi, about, 60, of, the, world, s, wetlands, are, made, of, peat, peat, deposits, are, found, in, many, places, around, the, world, including, northern, europe, and, north, america, the, north, american, peat, deposits, are, principally, found, in, canada, and, the, northern, united, states, some, of, the, world, s, largest, peatlands, include, the, west, siberian, lowland, the, hudson, bay, lowlands, and, the, mackenzie, river, valley, there, is, less, peat, in, the, southern, hemisphere, in, part, because, there, is, less, land, the, world, s, largest, tropical, peatland, is, located, in, africa, the, democratic, republic, of, congo, in, addition, the, vast, magellanic, moorland, in, south, america, southern, patagonia, tierra, del, fuego, is, an, extensive, peat, dominated, landscape, peat, can, be, found, in, new, zealand, kerguelen, the, falkland, islands, and, indonesia, kalimantan, rasau, jaya, west, kalimantan, and, sumatra, indonesia, has, more, tropical, peatlands, and, mangrove, forests, than, any, other, nation, on, earth, but, indonesia, is, losing, wetlands, by, 100, 000, hectares, 250, 000, acres, per, year, a, catalog, of, the, peat, research, collection, at, the, university, of, minnesota, duluth, provides, references, to, research, on, worldwide, peat, and, peatlands, about, 7, of, all, peatlands, have, been, exploited, for, agriculture, and, forestry, under, certain, conditions, peat, will, turn, into, lignite, coal, over, geologic, periods, of, time, peat, can, be, used, as, fuel, once, dried, traditionally, peat, is, cut, by, hand, and, left, to, dry, in, the, sun, in, many, countries, including, ireland, and, scotland, peat, was, traditionally, stacked, to, dry, in, rural, areas, and, used, for, cooking, and, domestic, heating, this, tradition, can, be, traced, back, to, the, roman, period, for, industrial, uses, companies, may, use, pressure, to, extract, water, from, the, peat, which, is, soft, and, easily, compressed, in, sweden, farmers, use, dried, peat, to, absorb, excrement, from, cattle, that, are, wintered, indoors, the, most, essential, property, of, peat, is, retaining, moisture, in, container, soil, when, it, is, dry, while, preventing, the, excess, water, from, killing, roots, when, it, is, wet, peat, can, store, nutrients, although, it, is, not, fertile, itself, it, is, polyelectrolytic, with, a, high, ion, exchange, capacity, due, to, its, oxidized, lignin, peat, is, discouraged, as, a, soil, amendment, by, the, royal, botanic, gardens, kew, england, since, 2003, while, bark, or, coir, based, peat, free, potting, soil, mixes, are, on, the, rise, particularly, in, the, uk, peat, is, still, used, as, raw, material, for, horticulture, in, some, other, european, countries, canada, as, well, as, parts, of, the, united, states, peatland, can, also, be, an, essential, source, of, drinking, water, providing, nearly, 4, of, all, potable, water, stored, in, reservoirs, in, the, uk, 43, of, the, population, receives, drinking, water, sourced, from, peatlands, with, the, number, climbing, to, 68, in, ireland, catchments, containing, peatlands, are, the, main, source, of, water, for, large, cities, including, dublin, peat, wetlands, also, used, to, have, a, degree, of, metallurgical, importance, in, the, early, middle, ages, being, the, primary, source, of, bog, iron, used, to, create, swords, and, armour, many, peat, swamps, along, the, coast, of, malaysia, serve, as, a, natural, means, of, flood, mitigation, with, any, overflow, being, absorbed, by, the, peat, provided, forests, are, still, present, to, prevent, peat, fires, peat, is, sometimes, used, in, freshwater, aquaria, it, is, seen, most, commonly, in, soft, water, or, blackwater, river, systems, such, as, those, mimicking, the, amazon, river, basin, in, addition, to, being, soft, and, therefore, suitable, for, demersal, bottom, dwelling, species, such, as, corydoras, catfish, peat, is, reported, to, have, many, other, beneficial, functions, in, freshwater, aquaria, it, softens, water, by, acting, as, an, ion, exchanger, it, also, contains, substances, that, are, beneficial, for, plants, and, fishes, reproductive, health, peat, can, prevent, algae, growth, and, kill, microorganisms, peat, often, stains, the, water, yellow, or, brown, due, to, the, leaching, of, tannins, peat, is, widely, used, in, balneotherapy, the, use, of, bathing, to, treat, disease, many, traditional, spa, treatments, include, peat, as, part, of, peloids, such, health, treatments, have, an, enduring, tradition, in, european, countries, including, poland, the, czech, republic, germany, and, austria, some, of, these, old, spas, date, back, to, the, 18th, century, and, are, still, active, today, the, most, common, types, of, peat, application, in, balneotherapy, are, peat, muds, poultices, and, suspension, baths, authors, rydin, and, jeglum, in, biology, of, habitats, described, the, concept, of, peat, archives, a, phrase, coined, by, influential, peatland, scientist, harry, godwin, in, 1981, in, a, peat, profile, there, is, a, fossilized, record, of, changes, over, time, in, the, vegetation, pollen, spores, animals, from, microscopic, to, the, giant, elk, and, archaeological, remains, that, have, been, deposited, in, place, as, well, as, pollen, spores, and, particles, brought, in, by, wind, and, weather, these, remains, are, collectively, termed, the, peat, archives, in, quaternary, palaeoecology, first, published, in, 1980, birks, and, birks, described, how, paleoecological, studies, of, peat, can, be, used, to, reveal, what, plant, communities, were, present, locally, and, regionally, what, period, each, community, occupied, how, environmental, conditions, changed, and, how, the, environment, affected, the, ecosystem, in, that, time, and, place, scientists, continue, to, compare, modern, mercury, hg, accumulation, rates, in, bogs, with, historical, natural, archives, records, in, peat, bogs, and, lake, sediments, to, estimate, the, potential, human, impacts, on, the, biogeochemical, cycle, of, mercury, for, example, over, the, years, different, dating, models, and, technologies, for, measuring, date, sediments, and, peat, profiles, accumulated, over, the, last, 100, 150, years, have, been, used, including, the, widely, used, vertical, distribution, of, 210pb, the, inductively, coupled, plasma, mass, spectrometry, icp, sms, and, more, recently, the, initial, penetration, ip, naturally, mummified, human, bodies, often, called, bog, bodies, have, been, found, in, various, places, in, scotland, england, ireland, and, especially, northern, germany, and, denmark, they, are, almost, perfectly, preserved, by, the, tanning, properties, of, the, acidic, water, as, well, as, by, the, antibiotic, properties, of, the, organic, component, sphagnan, a, famous, example, is, the, tollund, man, in, denmark, having, been, discovered, in, 1950, after, being, mistaken, for, a, recent, murder, victim, he, was, exhumed, for, scientific, purposes, and, dated, to, have, lived, during, the, 4th, century, bc, before, that, another, bog, body, the, elling, woman, had, been, discovered, in, 1938, in, the, same, bog, about, 60, m, 200, ft, from, the, tollund, man, she, is, believed, to, have, lived, during, the, late, 3rd, century, bc, and, was, a, ritual, sacrifice, in, the, bronze, and, iron, ages, people, used, peat, bogs, for, rituals, to, nature, gods, and, spirits, the, distinctive, ecological, conditions, of, peat, wetlands, provide, a, habitat, for, distinctive, fauna, and, flora, for, example, whooping, cranes, nest, in, north, american, peatlands, whilst, siberian, cranes, nest, in, the, west, siberian, peatland, palsa, mires, have, a, rich, bird, life, and, are, an, eu, red, listed, habitat, and, in, canada, riparian, peat, banks, are, used, as, maternity, sites, for, polar, bears, natural, peatlands, also, have, many, species, of, wild, orchids, and, carnivorous, plants, for, more, on, biological, communities, see, wetland, bog, or, fen, around, half, of, the, area, of, northern, peatlands, is, permafrost, affected, and, this, area, represents, around, a, tenth, of, the, total, permafrost, area, and, also, a, tenth, 185, 66, gt, of, all, permafrost, carbon, equivalent, to, around, half, of, the, carbon, stored, in, the, atmosphere, dry, peat, is, a, good, insulator, with, a, thermal, conductivity, of, around, 0, 25, wm, 1, k, 1, and, therefore, plays, an, important, role, in, protecting, permafrost, from, thaw, the, insulating, effect, of, dry, peat, also, makes, it, integral, to, unique, permafrost, landforms, such, as, palsas, and, permafrost, peat, plateaus, peatland, permafrost, thaw, tends, to, result, in, an, increase, in, methane, emissions, and, a, small, increase, in, carbon, dioxide, uptake, meaning, that, it, contributes, to, the, permafrost, carbon, feedback, under, 2, c, global, warming, 0, 7, million, km, 2, of, peatland, permafrost, could, thaw, and, with, warming, of, 1, 5, to, 6, c, a, cumulative, 0, 7, to, 3, pgc, of, methane, could, be, released, as, a, result, of, permafrost, peatland, thaw, by, 2100, the, forcing, from, these, potential, emissions, would, be, approximately, equivalent, to, 1, of, projected, anthropogenic, emissions, one, characteristic, of, peat, is, the, bioaccumulation, of, metals, concentrated, in, the, peat, accumulated, mercury, is, of, significant, environmental, concern, large, areas, of, organic, wetland, peat, soils, are, currently, drained, for, agriculture, forestry, and, peat, extraction, i, e, through, canals, this, process, is, taking, place, all, over, the, world, this, not, only, destroys, the, habitat, of, many, species, but, also, heavily, fuels, climate, change, as, a, result, of, peat, drainage, the, organic, carbon, which, built, over, thousands, of, years, and, is, normally, underwater, is, suddenly, exposed, to, the, air, it, decomposes, and, turns, into, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, which, is, released, into, the, atmosphere, the, global, co, 2, emissions, from, drained, peatlands, have, increased, from, 1, 058, mton, in, 1990, to, 1, 298, mton, in, 2008, a, 20, increase, this, increase, has, particularly, taken, place, in, developing, countries, of, which, indonesia, malaysia, and, papua, new, guinea, are, the, fastest, growing, top, emitters, this, estimate, excludes, emissions, from, peat, fires, conservative, estimates, amount, to, at, least, 4, 000, mton, co, 2, eq, yr, for, south, east, asia, with, 174, mton, co, 2, eq, yr, the, eu, is, after, indonesia, 500, mton, and, before, russia, 161, mton, the, world, s, second, largest, emitter, of, drainage, related, peatland, co, 2, excl, extracted, peat, and, fires, total, co, 2, emissions, from, the, worldwide, 500, 000, km, 2, of, degraded, peatland, may, exceed, 2, 0, gtons, including, emissions, from, peat, fires, which, is, almost, 6, of, all, global, carbon, emissions, peat, can, be, a, major, fire, hazard, and, is, not, extinguished, by, light, rain, peat, fires, may, burn, for, great, lengths, of, time, or, smoulder, underground, and, reignite, after, winter, if, an, oxygen, source, is, present, peat, has, a, high, carbon, content, and, can, burn, under, low, moisture, conditions, once, ignited, by, the, presence, of, a, heat, source, e, g, a, wildfire, penetrating, the, subsurface, it, smoulders, these, smouldering, fires, can, burn, undetected, for, very, long, periods, of, time, months, years, and, even, centuries, propagating, in, a, creeping, fashion, through, the, underground, peat, layer, despite, the, damage, that, the, burning, of, raw, peat, can, cause, bogs, are, naturally, subject, to, wildfires, and, depend, on, the, wildfires, to, keep, woody, competition, from, lowering, the, water, table, and, shading, out, many, bog, plants, several, families, of, plants, including, the, carnivorous, sarracenia, trumpet, pitcher, dionaea, venus, flytrap, utricularia, bladderworts, and, non, carnivorous, plants, such, as, the, sandhills, lily, toothache, grass, and, many, species, of, orchid, are, now, threatened, and, in, some, cases, endangered, from, the, combined, forces, of, human, drainage, negligence, and, absence, of, fire, the, recent, burning, of, peat, bogs, in, indonesia, with, their, large, and, deep, growths, containing, more, than, 50, billion, tonnes, 55, billion, short, tons, 49, billion, long, tons, of, carbon, has, contributed, to, increases, in, world, carbon, dioxide, levels, peat, deposits, in, southeast, asia, could, be, destroyed, by, 2040, it, is, estimated, that, in, 1997, peat, and, forest, fires, in, indonesia, released, between, 0, 81, and, 2, 57, gigatonnes, 0, 89, and, 2, 83, billion, short, tons, 0, 80, and, 2, 53, billion, long, tons, of, carbon, equivalent, to, 13, 40, percent, of, the, amount, released, by, global, fossil, fuel, burning, and, greater, than, the, carbon, uptake, of, the, world, s, biosphere, these, fires, may, be, responsible, for, the, acceleration, in, the, increase, in, carbon, dioxide, levels, since, 1998, more, than, 100, peat, fires, in, kalimantan, and, east, sumatra, have, continued, to, burn, since, 1997, each, year, these, peat, fires, ignite, new, forest, fires, above, the, ground, in, north, america, peat, fires, can, occur, during, severe, droughts, throughout, their, occurrence, from, boreal, forests, in, canada, to, swamps, and, fens, in, the, subtropical, southern, florida, everglades, once, a, fire, has, burnt, through, the, area, hollows, in, the, peat, are, burnt, out, and, hummocks, are, desiccated, but, can, contribute, to, sphagnum, recolonization, in, the, summer, of, 2010, an, unusually, high, heat, wave, of, up, to, 40, c, 104, f, ignited, large, deposits, of, peat, in, central, russia, burning, thousands, of, houses, and, covering, the, capital, of, moscow, with, a, toxic, smoke, blanket, the, situation, remained, critical, until, the, end, of, august, 2010, in, june, 2019, despite, some, forest, fire, prevention, methods, being, put, in, place, peat, fires, in, the, arctic, emitted, 50, megatonnes, 55, million, short, tons, 49, million, long, tons, of, co, 2, which, is, equal, to, sweden, s, total, annual, emissions, the, peat, fires, are, linked, to, climate, change, as, they, are, much, more, likely, to, occur, nowadays, due, to, this, effect, peat, hags, are, a, form, of, erosion, that, occurs, at, the, sides, of, gullies, that, cut, into, the, peat, or, sometimes, in, isolation, hags, may, result, when, flowing, water, cuts, downwards, into, the, peat, and, when, fire, or, overgrazing, exposes, the, peat, surface, once, the, peat, is, exposed, in, these, ways, it, is, prone, to, further, erosion, by, wind, water, and, livestock, the, result, is, overhanging, vegetation, and, peat, hags, are, too, steep, and, unstable, for, vegetation, to, establish, itself, so, they, continue, to, erode, unless, restorative, action, is, taken, in, june, 2002, the, united, nations, development, programme, launched, the, wetlands, ecosystem, and, tropical, peat, swamp, forest, rehabilitation, project, this, project, was, targeted, to, last, for, 5, years, and, brings, together, the, efforts, of, various, non, government, organisations, in, november, 2002, the, international, peatland, formerly, peat, society, ips, and, the, international, mire, conservation, group, imcg, published, guidelines, on, the, wise, use, of, mires, and, peatlands, backgrounds, and, principles, including, a, framework, for, decision, making, this, publication, aims, to, develop, mechanisms, that, can, balance, the, conflicting, demands, on, the, global, peatland, heritage, to, ensure, its, wise, use, to, meet, the, needs, of, humankind, in, june, 2008, the, ips, published, the, book, peatlands, and, climate, change, summarising, the, currently, available, knowledge, on, the, topic, in, 2010, ips, presented, a, strategy, for, responsible, peatland, management, which, can, be, applied, worldwide, for, decision, making, peat, extraction, is, forbidden, in, chile, since, april, 2024, often, restoration, is, done, by, blocking, drainage, channels, in, the, peatland, and, allowing, natural, vegetation, to, recover, rehabilitation, projects, undertaken, in, north, america, and, europe, usually, focus, on, the, rewetting, of, peatlands, and, revegetation, of, native, species, this, acts, to, mitigate, carbon, release, in, the, short, term, before, the, new, growth, of, vegetation, provides, a, new, source, of, organic, litter, to, fuel, the, peat, formation, in, the, long, term, unep, is, supporting, peatland, restoration, in, indonesia, latvia, has, been, the, biggest, exporter, of, peat, in, the, world, by, volume, providing, more, than, 19, 9, of, the, world, s, volume, followed, only, by, canada, with, 13, in, 2022, in, 2020, latvia, exported, 1, 97, million, tons, of, peat, followed, by, germany, with, 1, 5, and, canada, with, 1, 42, million, tons, nevertheless, although, first, in, the, world, by, volume, in, monetary, terms, latvian, comes, second, in, the, world, behind, canada, as, an, example, latvia, s, income, from, exports, was, 237, million, us, dollars, latvia, s, peat, deposits, have, been, estimated, to, equal, 1, 7, billion, tons, latvia, as, finland, due, its, climate, has, several, peat, bogs, which, account, for, 9, 9, of, the, country, s, territory, more, than, two, thirds, of, the, licensed, areas, for, peat, extraction, are, state, owned, 55, belong,

and, electricity, peat, provides, around, 4, of, finland, s, annual, energy, production, also, agricultural, and, forestry, drained, peat, bogs, actively, release, more, co, 2, annually, than, is, released, in, peat, energy, production, in, finland, the, average, regrowth, rate, of, a, single, peat, bog, however, is, indeed, slow, from, 1, 000, up, to, 5, 000, years, furthermore, it, is, a, common, practice, to, forest, used, peat, bogs, instead, of, giving, them, a, chance, to, renew, this, leads, to, lower, levels, of, co, 2, storage, than, the, original, peat, bog, at, 106, g, co, 2, mj, the, carbon, dioxide, emissions, of, peat, are, higher, than, those, of, coal, at, 94, 6, g, co, 2, mj, and, natural, gas, at, 56, 1, according, to, one, study, increasing, the, average, amount, of, wood, in, the, fuel, mixture, from, the, current, 2, 6, to, 12, 5, would, take, the, emissions, down, to, 93, g, co, 2, mj, that, said, little, effort, is, being, made, to, achieve, this, the, international, mire, conservation, group, imcg, in, 2006, urged, the, local, and, national, governments, of, finland, to, protect, and, conserve, the, remaining, pristine, peatland, ecosystems, this, includes, the, cessation, of, drainage, and, peat, extraction, in, intact, mire, sites, and, the, abandoning, of, current, and, planned, groundwater, extraction, that, may, affect, these, sites, a, proposal, for, a, finnish, peatland, management, strategy, was, presented, to, the, government, in, 2011, after, a, lengthy, consultation, phase, about, 15, of, the, land, in, sweden, is, covered, by, peatlands, whilst, nowadays, the, main, use, of, such, soils, is, for, forestry, peat, rich, lands, have, historically, been, exploited, to, produce, energy, agricultural, land, and, horticultural, substrates, the, most, common, method, to, extract, peat, during, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, was, peat, cutting, a, process, where, the, land, is, cleared, of, forest, and, subsequentially, drained, peat, cores, are, then, extracted, under, dry, weather, conditions, and, stored, on, stacks, to, let, the, residual, moisture, evaporate, today, clear, cutting, for, horticultural, peat, of, which, sweden, is, an, important, producer, in, europe, is, limited, to, some, areas, of, sweden, and, strictly, regulated, by, the, swedish, environmental, code, to, prevent, that, significant, groundwater, storages, and, carbon, sinks, areas, are, altered, and, compromised, by, human, activities, at, the, same, time, restoration, of, drained, peatlands, through, rewetting, is, urged, by, national, and, international, policies, to, exploit, the, peat, rich, soil, properties, in, mitigating, climate, change, effects, in, the, republic, of, ireland, a, state, owned, company, called, bord, na, m, na, was, responsible, for, managing, peat, extraction, it, processed, the, extracted, peat, into, milled, peat, which, was, used, in, power, stations, and, sold, processed, peat, fuel, in, the, form, of, peat, briquettes, which, is, used, for, domestic, heating, these, are, oblong, bars, of, densely, compressed, dried, and, shredded, peat, peat, moss, is, a, manufactured, product, for, use, in, garden, cultivation, turf, dried, out, peat, sods, is, also, commonly, used, in, rural, areas, in, january, 2021, bord, na, m, na, announced, that, it, had, ceased, all, peat, harvesting, and, cutting, operations, and, would, be, moving, its, business, to, a, climate, solutions, company, in, 2022, selling, peat, for, burning, was, prohibited, but, some, people, are, still, allowed, to, cut, and, burn, it, the, use, of, peat, for, energy, production, was, prominent, in, the, soviet, union, especially, in, 1965, in, 1929, over, 40, of, the, soviet, union, s, electric, energy, came, from, peat, which, dropped, to, 1, by, 1980, in, the, 1960s, larger, sections, of, swamps, and, bogs, in, western, russia, were, drained, for, agricultural, and, mining, purposes, 2, 500, years, ago, the, area, now, named, the, netherlands, was, largely, covered, with, peat, drainage, causing, compaction, and, oxidation, and, excavation, have, reduced, peatlands, 40, cm, 16, in, peat, to, about, 2, 733, km, 2, 1, 055, sq, mi, or, 10, of, the, land, area, mostly, used, as, meadows, drainage, and, excavation, have, lowered, the, surface, of, the, peatlands, in, the, west, of, the, country, dikes, and, mills, were, built, creating, polders, so, that, dwelling, and, economic, activities, could, continue, below, sea, level, the, first, polder, probably, in, 1533, and, the, last, one, in, 1968, harvesting, of, peat, could, continue, in, suitable, locations, as, the, lower, peat, layers, below, current, sea, level, became, exposed, this, peat, was, deposited, before, the, rise, of, the, sea, level, in, the, holocene, as, a, result, approximately, 26, of, the, area, and, 21, of, the, population, of, the, netherlands, are, presently, below, sea, level, the, deepest, point, is, in, the, zuidplaspolder, 6, 76, m, 22, 2, ft, below, average, sea, level, in, 2020, the, netherlands, imported, 2, 156, million, kg, of, peat, 5, 39, million, m3, 400, kg, m3, dry, peat, 44, 5, from, germany, 2020, 9, 5, from, estonia, 2018, 9, 2, from, latvia, 2020, 7, 2, from, ireland, 2018, 8, 0, from, sweden, 2019, 6, 5, from, lithuania, 2020, 5, 1, from, belgium, 2019, and, 1, 7, from, denmark, 2019, 1, 35, million, kg, was, exported, most, is, used, in, gardening, and, greenhouse, horticulture, since, the, netherlands, did, not, have, many, trees, to, use, as, firewood, or, charcoal, one, use, the, dutch, made, of, the, available, peat, was, to, fire, kilns, to, make, pottery, during, world, war, ii, the, dutch, resistance, came, up, with, an, unusual, use, for, peat, since, peat, was, so, available, in, the, fields, resistance, fighters, sometimes, stacked, peat, into, human, sized, piles, and, used, the, piles, for, target, practice, after, oil, shale, in, estonia, peat, is, the, second, most, mined, natural, resource, the, peat, production, sector, has, a, yearly, revenue, of, around, 100, million, and, it, is, mostly, export, oriented, peat, is,

the, sikkim, s, most, famous, and, diverse, peatlands, in, the, eastern, indian, territory, of, sikkim, which, includes, 682, species, representing, five, kingdoms, 196, families, and, 453, genera, england, has, around, 1, million, acres, of, peatland, peatlands, in, england, store, 584m, tonnes, of, carbon, in, total, but, emit, around, 11m, tonnes, of, co, 2, every, year, due, to, degradation, and, draining, in, 2021, only, 124, people, owned, 60, of, england, s, peatland, the, extraction, of, peat, from, the, somerset, levels, began, during, the, roman, times, and, has, been, carried, out, since, the, levels, were, first, drained, on, dartmoor, there, were, several, commercial, distillation, plants, formed, and, run, by, the, british, patent, naphtha, company, in, 1844, these, produced, naphtha, on, a, commercial, scale, from, the, high, quality, local, peat, fenn, s, whixall, and, bettisfield, mosses, is, an, element, of, a, post, ice, age, peat, bog, that, straddles, the, england, wales, border, and, contains, many, rare, plant, and, animal, species, due, to, the, acidic, environment, created, by, the, peat, only, lightly, hand, dug, it, is, now, a, national, nature, reserve, and, is, being, restored, to, its, natural, condition, the, industrial, extraction, of, peat, occurred, at, the, thorne, moor, site, outside, doncaster, near, the, village, of, hatfield, government, policy, incentivised, commercial, removal, to, peat, for, agricultural, use, this, caused, much, destruction, of, the, area, during, the, 1980s, the, removal, of, the, peat, resulted, in, later, flooding, further, downstream, at, goole, due, to, the, loss, of, water, retaining, peatlands, recently, regeneration, of, peatland, has, occurred, as, part, of, the, thorne, moors, project, and, at,

because, of, changes, in, agriculture, in, response, afforestation, has, seen, the, establishment, of, tentative, steps, towards, conservation, such, as, peatlands, park, county, armagh, which, is, an, area, of, special, scientific, interest, some, scotch, whisky, distilleries, such, as, those, on, islay, use, peat, fires, to, dry, malted, barley, the, drying, process, takes, about, 30, hours, this, gives, the, whiskies, a, distinctive, smoky, flavour, often, called, peatiness, the, peatiness, or, degree, of, peat, flavour, of, a, whisky, is, calculated, in, ppm, of, phenol, normal, highland, whiskies, have, a, peat, level, of, up, to, 30, ppm, and, the, whiskies, on, islay, usually, have, up, to, 50, ppm, in, rare, types, like, the, octomore, the, whisky, can, have, more, than, 100, ppm, of, phenol, scotch, ales, can, also, use, peat, roasted, malt, imparting, a, similar, smoked, flavor, because, they, are, easily, compressed, under, minimal, weight, peat, deposits, pose, significant, difficulties, for, building, structures, roads, and, railways, when, the, west, highland, railway, line, was, constructed, across, rannoch, moor, in, western, scotland, its, builders,
