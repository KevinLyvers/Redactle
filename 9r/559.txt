plate, tectonics, from, latin, tectonicus, from, ancient, greek, tektonik, s, pertaining, to, building, is, the, scientific, theory, that, earth, s, lithosphere, comprises, a, number, of, large, tectonic, plates, which, have, been, slowly, moving, since, 3, 4, billion, years, ago, the, model, builds, on, the, concept, of, continental, drift, an, idea, developed, during, the, first, decades, of, the, 20th, century, plate, tectonics, came, to, be, accepted, by, geoscientists, after, seafloor, spreading, was, validated, in, the, mid, to, late, 1960s, earth, s, lithosphere, the, rigid, outer, shell, of, the, planet, including, the, crust, and, upper, mantle, is, fractured, into, seven, or, eight, major, plates, depending, on, how, they, are, defined, and, many, minor, plates, or, platelets, where, the, plates, meet, their, relative, motion, determines, the, type, of, plate, boundary, or, fault, convergent, divergent, or, transform, the, relative, movement, of, the, plates, typically, ranges, from, zero, to, 10, cm, annually, faults, tend, to, be, geologically, active, experiencing, earthquakes, volcanic, activity, mountain, building, and, oceanic, trench, formation, tectonic, plates, are, composed, of, the, oceanic, lithosphere, and, the, thicker, continental, lithosphere, each, topped, by, its, own, kind, of, crust, along, convergent, plate, boundaries, the, process, of, subduction, carries, the, edge, of, one, plate, down, under, the, other, plate, and, into, the, mantle, this, process, reduces, the, total, surface, area, crust, of, the, earth, the, lost, surface, is, balanced, by, the, formation, of, new, oceanic, crust, along, divergent, margins, by, seafloor, spreading, keeping, the, total, surface, area, constant, in, a, tectonic, conveyor, belt, tectonic, plates, are, relatively, rigid, and, float, across, the, ductile, asthenosphere, beneath, lateral, density, variations, in, the, mantle, result, in, convection, currents, the, slow, creeping, motion, of, earth, s, solid, mantle, at, a, seafloor, spreading, ridge, plates, move, away, from, the, ridge, which, is, a, topographic, high, and, the, newly, formed, crust, cools, as, it, moves, away, increasing, its, density, and, contributing, to, the, motion, at, a, subduction, zone, the, relatively, cold, dense, oceanic, crust, sinks, down, into, the, mantle, forming, the, downward, convecting, limb, of, a, mantle, cell, which, is, the, strongest, driver, of, plate, motion, the, relative, importance, and, interaction, of, other, proposed, factors, such, as, active, convection, upwelling, inside, the, mantle, and, tidal, drag, of, the, moon, is, still, the, subject, of, debate, the, outer, layers, of, earth, are, divided, into, the, lithosphere, and, asthenosphere, the, division, is, based, on, differences, in, mechanical, properties, and, in, the, method, for, the, transfer, of, heat, the, lithosphere, is, cooler, and, more, rigid, while, the, asthenosphere, is, hotter, and, flows, more, easily, in, terms, of, heat, transfer, the, lithosphere, loses, heat, by, conduction, whereas, the, asthenosphere, also, transfers, heat, by, convection, and, has, a, nearly, adiabatic, temperature, gradient, this, division, should, not, be, confused, with, the, chemical, subdivision, of, these, same, layers, into, the, mantle, comprising, both, the, asthenosphere, and, the, mantle, portion, of, the, lithosphere, and, the, crust, a, given, piece, of, mantle, may, be, part, of, the, lithosphere, or, the, asthenosphere, at, different, times, depending, on, its, temperature, and, pressure, the, key, principle, of, plate, tectonics, is, that, the, lithosphere, exists, as, separate, and, distinct, tectonic, plates, which, ride, on, the, fluid, like, solid, the, asthenosphere, plate, motions, range, from, 10, to, 40, millimetres, per, year, 0, 4, to, 1, 6, in, year, at, the, mid, atlantic, ridge, about, as, fast, as, fingernails, grow, to, about, 160, millimetres, per, year, 6, 3, in, year, for, the, nazca, plate, about, as, fast, as, hair, grows, tectonic, lithosphere, plates, consist, of, lithospheric, mantle, overlain, by, one, or, two, types, of, crustal, material, oceanic, crust, in, older, texts, called, sima, from, silicon, and, magnesium, and, continental, crust, sial, from, silicon, and, aluminium, the, distinction, between, oceanic, crust, and, continental, crust, is, based, on, their, modes, of, formation, oceanic, crust, is, formed, at, sea, floor, spreading, centers, continental, crust, is, formed, through, arc, volcanism, and, accretion, of, terranes, through, plate, tectonic, processes, oceanic, crust, is, denser, than, continental, crust, because, it, has, less, silicon, and, more, of, the, heavier, elements, than, continental, crust, as, a, result, of, this, density, difference, oceanic, crust, generally, lies, below, sea, level, while, continental, crust, buoyantly, projects, above, sea, level, average, oceanic, lithosphere, is, typically, 100, km, 62, mi, thick, its, thickness, is, a, function, of, its, age, as, time, passes, it, cools, by, conducting, heat, from, below, and, releasing, it, raditively, into, space, the, adjacent, mantle, below, is, cooled, by, this, process, and, added, to, its, base, because, it, is, formed, at, mid, ocean, ridges, and, spreads, outwards, its, thickness, is, therefore, a, function, of, its, distance, from, the, mid, ocean, ridge, where, it, was, formed, for, a, typical, distance, that, oceanic, lithosphere, must, travel, before, being, subducted, the, thickness, varies, from, about, 6, km, 4, mi, thick, at, mid, ocean, ridges, to, greater, than, 100, km, 62, mi, at, subduction, zones, for, shorter, or, longer, distances, the, subduction, zone, and, therefore, also, the, mean, thickness, becomes, smaller, or, larger, respectively, continental, lithosphere, is, typically, about, 200, km, 120, mi, thick, though, this, varies, considerably, between, basins, mountain, ranges, and, stable, cratonic, interiors, of, continents, the, location, where, two, plates, meet, is, called, a, plate, boundary, plate, boundaries, are, where, geological, events, occur, such, as, earthquakes, and, the, creation, of, topographic, features, such, as, mountains, volcanoes, mid, ocean, ridges, and, oceanic, trenches, the, vast, majority, of, the, world, s, active, volcanoes, occur, along, plate, boundaries, with, the, pacific, plate, s, ring, of, fire, being, the, most, active, and, widely, known, some, volcanoes, occur, in, the, interiors, of, plates, and, these, have, been, variously, attributed, to, internal, plate, deformation, and, to, mantle, plumes, tectonic, plates, may, include, continental, crust, or, oceanic, crust, or, both, for, example, the, african, plate, includes, the, continent, and, parts, of, the, floor, of, the, atlantic, and, indian, oceans, some, pieces, of, oceanic, crust, known, as, ophiolites, failed, to, be, subducted, under, continental, crust, at, destructive, plate, boundaries, instead, these, oceanic, crustal, fragments, were, pushed, upward, and, were, preserved, within, continental, crust, three, types, of, plate, boundaries, exist, characterized, by, the, way, the, plates, move, relative, to, each, other, they, are, associated, with, different, types, of, surface, phenomena, the, different, types, of, plate, boundaries, are, tectonic, plates, are, able, to, move, because, of, the, relative, density, of, oceanic, lithosphere, and, the, relative, weakness, of, the, asthenosphere, dissipation, of, heat, from, the, mantle, is, the, original, source, of, the, energy, required, to, drive, plate, tectonics, through, convection, or, large, scale, upwelling, and, doming, as, a, consequence, a, powerful, source, generating, plate, motion, is, the, excess, density, of, the, oceanic, lithosphere, sinking, in, subduction, zones, when, the, new, crust, forms, at, mid, ocean, ridges, this, oceanic, lithosphere, is, initially, less, dense, than, the, underlying, asthenosphere, but, it, becomes, denser, with, age, as, it, conductively, cools, and, thickens, the, greater, density, of, old, lithosphere, relative, to, the, underlying, asthenosphere, allows, it, to, sink, into, the, deep, mantle, at, subduction, zones, providing, most, of, the, driving, force, for, plate, movement, the, weakness, of, the, asthenosphere, allows, the, tectonic, plates, to, move, easily, towards, a, subduction, zone, for, much, of, the, first, quarter, of, the, 20th, century, the, leading, theory, of, the, driving, force, behind, tectonic, plate, motions, envisaged, large, scale, convection, currents, in, the, upper, mantle, which, can, be, transmitted, through, the, asthenosphere, this, theory, was, launched, by, arthur, holmes, and, some, forerunners, in, the, 1930s, and, was, immediately, recognized, as, the, solution, for, the, acceptance, of, the, theory, as, originally, discussed, in, the, papers, of, alfred, wegener, in, the, early, years, of, the, 20th, century, however, despite, its, acceptance, it, was, long, debated, in, the, scientific, community, because, the, leading, theory, still, envisaged, a, static, earth, without, moving, continents, up, until, the, major, breakthroughs, of, the, early, sixties, two, and, three, dimensional, imaging, of, earth, s, interior, seismic, tomography, shows, a, varying, lateral, density, distribution, throughout, the, mantle, such, density, variations, can, be, material, from, rock, chemistry, mineral, from, variations, in, mineral, structures, or, thermal, through, thermal, expansion, and, contraction, from, heat, energy, the, manifestation, of, this, varying, lateral, density, is, mantle, convection, from, buoyancy, forces, how, mantle, convection, directly, and, indirectly, relates, to, plate, motion, is, a, matter, of, ongoing, study, and, discussion, in, geodynamics, somehow, this, energy, must, be, transferred, to, the, lithosphere, for, tectonic, plates, to, move, there, are, essentially, two, main, types, of, mechanisms, that, are, thought, to, exist, related, to, the, dynamics, of, the, mantle, that, influence, plate, motion, which, are, primary, through, the, large, scale, convection, cells, or, secondary, the, secondary, mechanisms, view, plate, motion, driven, by, friction, between, the, convection, currents, in, the, asthenosphere, and, the, more, rigid, overlying, lithosphere, this, is, due, to, the, inflow, of, mantle, material, related, to, the, downward, pull, on, plates, in, subduction, zones, at, ocean, trenches, slab, pull, may, occur, in, a, geodynamic, setting, where, basal, tractions, continue, to, act, on, the, plate, as, it, dives, into, the, mantle, although, perhaps, to, a, greater, extent, acting, on, both, the, under, and, upper, side, of, the, slab, furthermore, slabs, that, are, broken, off, and, sink, into, the, mantle, can, cause, viscous, mantle, forces, driving, plates, through, slab, suction, in, the, theory, of, plume, tectonics, followed, by, numerous, researchers, during, the, 1990s, a, modified, concept, of, mantle, convection, currents, is, used, it, asserts, that, super, plumes, rise, from, the, deeper, mantle, and, are, the, drivers, or, substitutes, of, the, major, convection, cells, these, ideas, find, their, roots, in, the, early, 1930s, in, the, works, of, beloussov, and, van, bemmelen, which, were, initially, opposed, to, plate, tectonics, and, placed, the, mechanism, in, a, fixed, frame, of, vertical, movements, van, bemmelen, later, modified, the, concept, in, his, undation, models, and, used, mantle, blisters, as, the, driving, force, for, horizontal, movements, invoking, gravitational, forces, away, from, the, regional, crustal, doming, the, theories, find, resonance, in, the, modern, theories, which, envisage, hot, spots, or, mantle, plumes, which, remain, fixed, and, are, overridden, by, oceanic, and, continental, lithosphere, plates, over, time, and, leave, their, traces, in, the, geological, record, though, these, phenomena, are, not, invoked, as, real, driving, mechanisms, but, rather, as, modulators, the, mechanism, is, still, advocated, to, explain, the, break, up, of, supercontinents, during, specific, geological, epochs, it, has, followers, amongst, the, scientists, involved, in, the, theory, of, earth, expansion, another, theory, is, that, the, mantle, flows, neither, in, cells, nor, large, plumes, but, rather, as, a, series, of, channels, just, below, earth, s, crust, which, then, provide, basal, friction, to, the, lithosphere, this, theory, called, surge, tectonics, was, popularized, during, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, recent, research, based, on, three, dimensional, computer, modelling, suggests, that, plate, geometry, is, governed, by, a, feedback, between, mantle, convection, patterns, and, the, strength, of, the, lithosphere, forces, related, to, gravity, are, invoked, as, secondary, phenomena, within, the, framework, of, a, more, general, driving, mechanism, such, as, the, various, forms, of, mantle, dynamics, described, above, in, modern, views, gravity, is, invoked, as, the, major, driving, force, through, slab, pull, along, subduction, zones, gravitational, sliding, away, from, a, spreading, ridge, is, one, of, the, proposed, driving, forces, it, proposes, plate, motion, is, driven, by, the, higher, elevation, of, plates, at, ocean, ridges, as, oceanic, lithosphere, is, formed, at, spreading, ridges, from, hot, mantle, material, it, gradually, cools, and, thickens, with, age, and, thus, adds, distance, from, the, ridge, cool, oceanic, lithosphere, is, significantly, denser, than, the, hot, mantle, material, from, which, it, is, derived, and, so, with, increasing, thickness, it, gradually, subsides, into, the, mantle, to, compensate, the, greater, load, the, result, is, a, slight, lateral, incline, with, increased, distance, from, the, ridge, axis, this, force, is, regarded, as, a, secondary, force, and, is, often, referred, to, as, ridge, push, this, is, a, misnomer, as, there, is, no, force, pushing, horizontally, indeed, tensional, features, are, dominant, along, ridges, it, is, more, accurate, to, refer, to, this, mechanism, as, gravitational, sliding, since, the, topography, across, the, whole, plate, can, vary, considerably, and, spreading, ridges, are, only, the, most, prominent, feature, other, mechanisms, generating, this, gravitational, secondary, force, include, flexural, bulging, of, the, lithosphere, before, it, dives, underneath, an, adjacent, plate, producing, a, clear, topographical, feature, that, can, offset, or, at, least, affect, the, influence, of, topographical, ocean, ridges, mantle, plumes, and, hot, spots, are, also, postulated, to, impinge, on, the, underside, of, tectonic, plates, slab, pull, scientific, opinion, is, that, the, asthenosphere, is, insufficiently, competent, or, rigid, to, directly, cause, motion, by, friction, along, the, base, of, the, lithosphere, slab, pull, is, therefore, most, widely, thought, to, be, the, greatest, force, acting, on, the, plates, in, this, understanding, plate, motion, is, mostly, driven, by, the, weight, of, cold, dense, plates, sinking, into, the, mantle, at, trenches, recent, models, indicate, that, trench, suction, plays, an, important, role, as, well, however, the, fact, that, the, north, american, plate, is, nowhere, being, subducted, although, it, is, in, motion, presents, a, problem, the, same, holds, for, the, african, eurasian, and, antarctic, plates, gravitational, sliding, away, from, mantle, doming, according, to, older, theories, one, of, the, driving, mechanisms, of, the, plates, is, the, existence, of, large, scale, asthenosphere, mantle, domes, which, cause, the, gravitational, sliding, of, lithosphere, plates, away, from, them, see, the, paragraph, on, mantle, mechanisms, this, gravitational, sliding, represents, a, secondary, phenomenon, of, this, basically, vertically, oriented, mechanism, it, finds, its, roots, in, the, undation, model, of, van, bemmelen, this, can, act, on, various, scales, from, the, small, scale, of, one, island, arc, up, to, the, larger, scale, of, an, entire, ocean, basin, alfred, wegener, being, a, meteorologist, had, proposed, tidal, forces, and, centrifugal, forces, as, the, main, driving, mechanisms, behind, continental, drift, however, these, forces, were, considered, far, too, small, to, cause, continental, motion, as, the, concept, was, of, continents, plowing, through, oceanic, crust, therefore, wegener, later, changed, his, position, and, asserted, that, convection, currents, are, the, main, driving, force, of, plate, tectonics, in, the, last, edition, of, his, book, in, 1929, however, in, the, plate, tectonics, context, accepted, since, the, seafloor, spreading, proposals, of, heezen, hess, dietz, morley, vine, and, matthews, see, below, during, the, early, 1960s, the, oceanic, crust, is, suggested, to, be, in, motion, with, the, continents, which, caused, the, proposals, related, to, earth, rotation, to, be, reconsidered, in, more, recent, literature, these, driving, forces, are, forces, that, are, small, and, generally, negligible, are, for, these, mechanisms, to, be, overall, valid, systematic, relationships, should, exist, all, over, the, globe, between, the, orientation, and, kinematics, of, deformation, and, the, geographical, latitudinal, and, longitudinal, grid, of, earth, itself, these, systematic, relations, studies, in, the, second, half, of, the, nineteenth, century, and, the, first, half, of, the, twentieth, century, underline, exactly, the, opposite, that, the, plates, had, not, moved, in, time, that, the, deformation, grid, was, fixed, with, respect, to, earth, s, equator, and, axis, and, that, gravitational, driving, forces, were, generally, acting, vertically, and, caused, only, local, horizontal, movements, the, so, called, pre, plate, tectonic, fixist, theories, later, studies, discussed, below, on, this, page, therefore, invoked, many, of, the, relationships, recognized, during, this, pre, plate, tectonics, period, to, support, their, theories, see, reviews, of, these, various, mechanisms, related, to, earth, rotation, the, work, of, van, dijk, and, collaborators, of, the, many, forces, discussed, above, tidal, force, is, still, highly, debated, and, defended, as, a, possible, principal, driving, force, of, plate, tectonics, the, other, forces, are, only, used, in, global, geodynamic, models, not, using, plate, tectonics, concepts, therefore, beyond, the, discussions, treated, in, this, section, or, proposed, as, minor, modulations, within, the, overall, plate, tectonics, model, in, 1973, george, w, moore, of, the, usgs, and, r, c, bostrom, presented, evidence, for, a, general, westward, drift, of, earth, s, lithosphere, with, respect, to, the, mantle, based, on, the, steepness, of, the, subduction, zones, shallow, dipping, towards, the, east, steeply, dipping, towards, the, west, they, concluded, that, tidal, forces, the, tidal, lag, or, friction, caused, by, earth, s, rotation, and, the, forces, acting, upon, it, by, the, moon, are, a, driving, force, for, plate, tectonics, as, earth, spins, eastward, beneath, the, moon, the, moon, s, gravity, ever, so, slightly, pulls, earth, s, surface, layer, back, westward, just, as, proposed, by, alfred, wegener, see, above, since, 1990, this, theory, is, mainly, advocated, by, doglioni, and, co, workers, doglioni, 1990, such, as, in, a, more, recent, 2006, study, where, scientists, reviewed, and, advocated, these, ideas, it, has, been, suggested, in, lovett, 2006, that, this, observation, may, also, explain, why, venus, and, mars, have, no, plate, tectonics, as, venus, has, no, moon, and, mars, moons, are, too, small, to, have, significant, tidal, effects, on, the, planet, in, a, paper, by, it, was, suggested, that, on, the, other, hand, it, can, easily, be, observed, that, many, plates, are, moving, north, and, eastward, and, that, the, dominantly, westward, motion, of, the, pacific, ocean, basins, derives, simply, from, the, eastward, bias, of, the, pacific, spreading, center, which, is, not, a, predicted, manifestation, of, such, lunar, forces, in, the, same, paper, the, authors, admit, however, that, relative, to, the, lower, mantle, there, is, a, slight, westward, component, in, the, motions, of, all, the, plates, they, demonstrated, though, that, the, westward, drift, seen, only, for, the, past, 30, ma, is, attributed, to, the, increased, dominance, of, the, steadily, growing, and, accelerating, pacific, plate, the, debate, is, still, open, and, a, recent, paper, by, hofmeister, et, al, 2022, revived, the, idea, advocating, again, the, interaction, between, the, earth, s, rotation, and, the, moon, as, main, driving, forces, for, the, plates, the, vector, of, a, plate, s, motion, is, a, function, of, all, the, forces, acting, on, the, plate, however, therein, lies, the, problem, regarding, the, degree, to, which, each, process, contributes, to, the, overall, motion, of, each, tectonic, plate, the, diversity, of, geodynamic, settings, and, the, properties, of, each, plate, result, from, the, impact, of, the, various, processes, actively, driving, each, individual, plate, one, method, of, dealing, with, this, problem, is, to, consider, the, relative, rate, at, which, each, plate, is, moving, as, well, as, the, evidence, related, to, the, significance, of, each, process, to, the, overall, driving, force, on, the, plate, one, of, the, most, significant, correlations, discovered, to, date, is, that, lithospheric, plates, attached, to, downgoing, subducting, plates, move, much, faster, than, other, types, of, plates, the, pacific, plate, for, instance, is, essentially, surrounded, by, zones, of, subduction, the, so, called, ring, of, fire, and, moves, much, faster, than, the, plates, of, the, atlantic, basin, which, are, attached, perhaps, one, could, say, welded, to, adjacent, continents, instead, of, subducting, plates, it, is, thus, thought, that, forces, associated, with, the, downgoing, plate, slab, pull, and, slab, suction, are, the, driving, forces, which, determine, the, motion, of, plates, except, for, those, plates, which, are, not, being, subducted, this, view, however, has, been, contradicted, by, a, recent, study, which, found, that, the, actual, motions, of, the, pacific, plate, and, other, plates, associated, with, the, east, pacific, rise, do, not, correlate, mainly, with, either, slab, pull, or, slab, push, but, rather, with, a, mantle, convection, upwelling, whose, horizontal, spreading, along, the, bases, of, the, various, plates, drives, them, along, via, viscosity, related, traction, forces, the, driving, forces, of, plate, motion, continue, to, be, active, subjects, of, on, going, research, within, geophysics, and, tectonophysics, the, development, of, the, theory, of, plate, tectonics, was, the, scientific, and, cultural, change, which, occurred, during, a, period, of, 50, years, of, scientific, debate, the, event, of, the, acceptance, itself, was, a, paradigm, shift, and, can, therefore, be, classified, as, a, scientific, revolution, now, described, as, the, plate, tectonics, revolution, around, the, start, of, the, twentieth, century, various, theorists, unsuccessfully, attempted, to, explain, the, many, geographical, geological, and, biological, continuities, between, continents, in, 1912, the, meteorologist, alfred, wegener, described, what, he, called, continental, drift, an, idea, that, culminated, fifty, years, later, in, the, modern, theory, of, plate, tectonics, wegener, expanded, his, theory, in, his, 1915, book, the, origin, of, continents, and, oceans, starting, from, the, idea, also, expressed, by, his, forerunners, that, the, present, continents, once, formed, a, single, land, mass, later, called, pangaea, wegener, suggested, that, these, separated, and, drifted, apart, likening, them, to, icebergs, of, low, density, sial, floating, on, a, sea, of, denser, sima, supporting, evidence, for, the, idea, came, from, the, dove, tailing, outlines, of, south, america, s, east, coast, and, africa, s, west, coast, antonio, snider, pellegrini, had, drawn, on, his, maps, and, from, the, matching, of, the, rock, formations, along, these, edges, confirmation, of, their, previous, contiguous, nature, also, came, from, the, fossil, plants, glossopteris, and, gangamopteris, and, the, therapsid, or, mammal, like, reptile, lystrosaurus, all, widely, distributed, over, south, america, africa, antarctica, india, and, australia, the, evidence, for, such, an, erstwhile, joining, of, these, continents, was, patent, to, field, geologists, working, in, the, southern, hemisphere, the, south, african, alex, du, toit, put, together, a, mass, of, such, information, in, his, 1937, publication, our, wandering, continents, and, went, further, than, wegener, in, recognising, the, strong, links, between, the, gondwana, fragments, wegener, s, work, was, initially, not, widely, accepted, in, part, due, to, a, lack, of, detailed, evidence, but, mostly, because, of, the, lack, of, a, reasonable, physically, supported, mechanism, earth, might, have, a, solid, crust, and, mantle, and, a, liquid, core, but, there, seemed, to, be, no, way, that, portions, of, the, crust, could, move, around, many, distinguished, scientists, of, the, time, such, as, harold, jeffreys, and, charles, schuchert, were, outspoken, critics, of, continental, drift, despite, much, opposition, the, view, of, continental, drift, gained, support, and, a, lively, debate, started, between, drifters, or, mobilists, proponents, of, the, theory, and, fixists, opponents, during, the, 1920s, 1930s, and, 1940s, the, former, reached, important, milestones, proposing, that, convection, currents, might, have, driven, the, plate, movements, and, that, spreading, may, have, occurred, below, the, sea, within, the, oceanic, crust, concepts, close, to, the, elements, of, plate, tectonics, were, proposed, by, geophysicists, and, geologists, both, fixists, and, mobilists, like, vening, meinesz, holmes, and, umbgrove, in, 1941, otto, ampferer, described, in, his, publication, thoughts, on, the, motion, picture, of, the, atlantic, region, processes, that, anticipated, seafloor, spreading, and, subduction, one, of, the, first, pieces, of, geophysical, evidence, that, was, used, to, support, the, movement, of, lithospheric, plates, came, from, paleomagnetism, this, is, based, on, the, fact, that, rocks, of, different, ages, show, a, variable, magnetic, field, direction, evidenced, by, studies, since, the, mid, nineteenth, century, the, magnetic, north, and, south, poles, reverse, through, time, and, especially, important, in, paleotectonic, studies, the, relative, position, of, the, magnetic, north, pole, varies, through, time, initially, during, the, first, half, of, the, twentieth, century, the, latter, phenomenon, was, explained, by, introducing, what, was, called, polar, wander, see, apparent, polar, wander, i, e, it, was, assumed, that, the, north, pole, location, had, been, shifting, through, time, an, alternative, explanation, though, was, that, the, continents, had, moved, shifted, and, rotated, relative, to, the, north, pole, and, each, continent, in, fact, shows, its, own, polar, wander, path, during, the, late, 1950s, it, was, successfully, shown, on, two, occasions, that, these, data, could, show, the, validity, of, continental, drift, by, keith, runcorn, in, a, paper, in, 1956, and, by, warren, carey, in, a, symposium, held, in, march, 1956, the, second, piece, of, evidence, in, support, of, continental, drift, came, during, the, late, 1950s, and, early, 60s, from, data, on, the, bathymetry, of, the, deep, ocean, floors, and, the, nature, of, the, oceanic, crust, such, as, magnetic, properties, and, more, generally, with, the, development, of, marine, geology, which, gave, evidence, for, the, association, of, seafloor, spreading, along, the, mid, oceanic, ridges, and, magnetic, field, reversals, published, between, 1959, and, 1963, by, heezen, dietz, hess, mason, vine, matthews, and, morley, simultaneous, advances, in, early, seismic, imaging, techniques, in, and, around, wadati, benioff, zones, along, the, trenches, bounding, many, continental, margins, together, with, many, other, geophysical, e, g, gravimetric, and, geological, observations, showed, how, the, oceanic, crust, could, disappear, into, the, mantle, providing, the, mechanism, to, balance, the, extension, of, the, ocean, basins, with, shortening, along, its, margins, all, this, evidence, both, from, the, ocean, floor, and, from, the, continental, margins, made, it, clear, around, 1965, that, continental, drift, was, feasible, the, theory, of, plate, tectonics, was, defined, in, a, series, of, papers, between, 1965, and, 1967, the, theory, revolutionized, the, earth, sciences, explaining, a, diverse, range, of, geological, phenomena, and, their, implications, in, other, studies, such, as, paleogeography, and, paleobiology, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, geologists, assumed, that, earth, s, major, features, were, fixed, and, that, most, geologic, features, such, as, basin, development, and, mountain, ranges, could, be, explained, by, vertical, crustal, movement, described, in, what, is, called, the, geosynclinal, theory, generally, this, was, placed, in, the, context, of, a, contracting, planet, earth, due, to, heat, loss, in, the, course, of, a, relatively, short, geological, time, it, was, observed, as, early, as, 1596, that, the, opposite, coasts, of, the, atlantic, ocean, or, more, precisely, the, edges, of, the, continental, shelves, have, similar, shapes, and, seem, to, have, once, fitted, together, since, that, time, many, theories, were, proposed, to, explain, this, apparent, complementarity, but, the, assumption, of, a, solid, earth, made, these, various, proposals, difficult, to, accept, the, discovery, of, radioactivity, and, its, associated, heating, properties, in, 1895, prompted, a, re, examination, of, the, apparent, age, of, earth, this, had, previously, been, estimated, by, its, cooling, rate, under, the, assumption, that, earth, s, surface, radiated, like, a, black, body, those, calculations, had, implied, that, even, if, it, started, at, red, heat, earth, would, have, dropped, to, its, present, temperature, in, a, few, tens, of, millions, of, years, armed, with, the, knowledge, of, a, new, heat, source, scientists, realized, that, earth, would, be, much, older, and, that, its, core, was, still, sufficiently, hot, to, be, liquid, by, 1915, after, having, published, a, first, article, in, 1912, alfred, wegener, was, making, serious, arguments, for, the, idea, of, continental, drift, in, the, first, edition, of, the, origin, of, continents, and, oceans, in, that, book, re, issued, in, four, successive, editions, up, to, the, final, one, in, 1936, he, noted, how, the, east, coast, of, south, america, and, the, west, coast, of, africa, looked, as, if, they, were, once, attached, wegener, was, not, the, first, to, note, this, abraham, ortelius, antonio, snider, pellegrini, eduard, suess, roberto, mantovani, and, frank, bursley, taylor, preceded, him, just, to, mention, a, few, but, he, was, the, first, to, marshal, significant, fossil, and, paleo, topographical, and, climatological, evidence, to, support, this, simple, observation, and, was, supported, in, this, by, researchers, such, as, alex, du, toit, furthermore, when, the, rock, strata, of, the, margins, of, separate, continents, are, very, similar, it, suggests, that, these, rocks, were, formed, in, the, same, way, implying, that, they, were, joined, initially, for, instance, parts, of, scotland, and, ireland, contain, rocks, very, similar, to, those, found, in, newfoundland, and, new, brunswick, furthermore, the, caledonian, mountains, of, europe, and, parts, of, the, appalachian, mountains, of, north, america, are, very, similar, in, structure, and, lithology, however, his, ideas, were, not, taken, seriously, by, many, geologists, who, pointed, out, that, there, was, no, apparent, mechanism, for, continental, drift, specifically, they, did, not, see, how, continental, rock, could, plow, through, the, much, denser, rock, that, makes, up, oceanic, crust, wegener, could, not, explain, the, force, that, drove, continental, drift, and, his, vindication, did, not, come, until, after, his, death, in, 1930, as, it, was, observed, early, that, although, granite, existed, on, continents, seafloor, seemed, to, be, composed, of, denser, basalt, the, prevailing, concept, during, the, first, half, of, the, twentieth, century, was, that, there, were, two, types, of, crust, named, sial, continental, type, crust, and, sima, oceanic, type, crust, furthermore, it, was, supposed, that, a, static, shell, of, strata, was, present, under, the, continents, it, therefore, looked, apparent, that, a, layer, of, basalt, sial, underlies, the, continental, rocks, however, based, on, abnormalities, in, plumb, line, deflection, by, the, andes, in, peru, pierre, bouguer, had, deduced, that, less, dense, mountains, must, have, a, downward, projection, into, the, denser, layer, underneath, the, concept, that, mountains, had, roots, was, confirmed, by, george, b, airy, a, hundred, years, later, during, study, of, himalayan, gravitation, and, seismic, studies, detected, corresponding, density, variations, therefore, by, the, mid, 1950s, the, question, remained, unresolved, as, to, whether, mountain, roots, were, clenched, in, surrounding, basalt, or, were, floating, on, it, like, an, iceberg, during, the, 20th, century, improvements, in, and, greater, use, of, seismic, instruments, such, as, seismographs, enabled, scientists, to, learn, that, earthquakes, tend, to, be, concentrated, in, specific, areas, most, notably, along, the, oceanic, trenches, and, spreading, ridges, by, the, late, 1920s, seismologists, were, beginning, to, identify, several, prominent, earthquake, zones, parallel, to, the, trenches, that, typically, were, inclined, 40, 60, from, the, horizontal, and, extended, several, hundred, kilometers, into, earth, these, zones, later, became, known, as, wadati, benioff, zones, or, simply, benioff, zones, in, honor, of, the, seismologists, who, first, recognized, them, kiyoo, wadati, of, japan, and, hugo, benioff, of, the, united, states, the, study, of, global, seismicity, greatly, advanced, in, the, 1960s, with, the, establishment, of, the, worldwide, standardized, seismograph, network, wwssn, to, monitor, the, compliance, of, the, 1963, treaty, banning, above, ground, testing, of, nuclear, weapons, the, much, improved, data, from, the, wwssn, instruments, allowed, seismologists, to, map, precisely, the, zones, of, earthquake, concentration, worldwide, meanwhile, debates, developed, around, the, phenomenon, of, polar, wander, since, the, early, debates, of, continental, drift, scientists, had, discussed, and, used, evidence, that, polar, drift, had, occurred, because, continents, seemed, to, have, moved, through, different, climatic, zones, during, the, past, furthermore, paleomagnetic, data, had, shown, that, the, magnetic, pole, had, also, shifted, during, time, reasoning, in, an, opposite, way, the, continents, might, have, shifted, and, rotated, while, the, pole, remained, relatively, fixed, the, first, time, the, evidence, of, magnetic, polar, wander, was, used, to, support, the, movements, of, continents, was, in, a, paper, by, keith, runcorn, in, 1956, and, successive, papers, by, him, and, his, students, ted, irving, who, was, actually, the, first, to, be, convinced, of, the, fact, that, paleomagnetism, supported, continental, drift, and, ken, creer, this, was, immediately, followed, by, a, symposium, on, continental, drift, in, tasmania, in, march, 1956, organised, by, s, warren, carey, who, had, been, one, of, the, supporters, and, promotors, of, continental, drift, since, the, thirties, during, this, symposium, some, of, the, participants, used, the, evidence, in, the, theory, of, an, expansion, of, the, global, crust, a, theory, which, had, been, proposed, by, other, workers, decades, earlier, in, this, hypothesis, the, shifting, of, the, continents, is, explained, by, a, large, increase, in, the, size, of, earth, since, its, formation, however, although, the, theory, still, has, supporters, in, science, this, is, generally, regarded, as, unsatisfactory, because, there, is, no, convincing, mechanism, to, produce, a, significant, expansion, of, earth, other, work, during, the, following, years, would, soon, show, that, the, evidence, was, equally, in, support, of, continental, drift, on, a, globe, with, a, stable, radius, during, the, 1930s, up, to, the, late, 1950s, works, by, vening, meinesz, holmes, umbgrove, and, numerous, others, outlined, concepts, that, were, close, or, nearly, identical, to, modern, plate, tectonics, theory, in, particular, the, english, geologist, arthur, holmes, proposed, in, 1920, that, plate, junctions, might, lie, beneath, the, sea, and, in, 1928, that, convection, currents, within, the, mantle, might, be, the, driving, force, often, these, contributions, are, forgotten, because, in, 1947, a, team, of, scientists, led, by, maurice, ewing, utilizing, the, woods, hole, oceanographic, institution, s, research, vessel, atlantis, and, an, array, of, instruments, confirmed, the, existence, of, a, rise, in, the, central, atlantic, ocean, and, found, that, the, floor, of, the, seabed, beneath, the, layer, of, sediments, consisted, of, basalt, not, the, granite, which, is, the, main, constituent, of, continents, they, also, found, that, the, oceanic, crust, was, much, thinner, than, continental, crust, all, these, new, findings, raised, important, and, intriguing, questions, the, new, data, that, had, been, collected, on, the, ocean, basins, also, showed, particular, characteristics, regarding, the, bathymetry, one, of, the, major, outcomes, of, these, datasets, was, that, all, along, the, globe, a, system, of, mid, oceanic, ridges, was, detected, an, important, conclusion, was, that, along, this, system, new, ocean, floor, was, being, created, which, led, to, the, concept, of, the, great, global, rift, this, was, described, in, the, crucial, paper, of, bruce, heezen, 1960, based, on, his, work, with, marie, tharp, which, would, trigger, a, real, revolution, in, thinking, a, profound, consequence, of, seafloor, spreading, is, that, new, crust, was, and, still, is, being, continually, created, along, the, oceanic, ridges, for, this, reason, heezen, initially, advocated, the, so, called, expanding, earth, hypothesis, of, s, warren, carey, see, above, therefore, the, question, remained, as, to, how, new, crust, could, continuously, be, added, along, the, oceanic, ridges, without, increasing, the, size, of, earth, in, reality, this, question, had, been, solved, already, by, numerous, scientists, during, the, 1940s, and, the, 1950s, like, arthur, holmes, vening, meinesz, coates, and, many, others, the, crust, in, excess, disappeared, along, what, were, called, the, oceanic, trenches, where, so, called, subduction, occurred, therefore, when, various, scientists, during, the, early, 1960s, started, to, reason, on, the, data, at, their, disposal, regarding, the, ocean, floor, the, pieces, of, the, theory, quickly, fell, into, place, the, question, particularly, intrigued, harry, hammond, hess, a, princeton, university, geologist, and, a, naval, reserve, rear, admiral, and, robert, s, dietz, a, scientist, with, the, united, states, coast, and, geodetic, survey, who, coined, the, term, seafloor, spreading, dietz, and, hess, the, former, published, the, same, idea, one, year, earlier, in, nature, but, priority, belongs, to, hess, who, had, already, distributed, an, unpublished, manuscript, of, his, 1962, article, by, 1960, were, among, the, small, number, who, really, understood, the, broad, implications, of, sea, floor, spreading, and, how, it, would, eventually, agree, with, the, at, that, time, unconventional, and, unaccepted, ideas, of, continental, drift, and, the, elegant, and, mobilistic, models, proposed, by, previous, workers, like, holmes, in, the, same, year, robert, r, coats, of, the, u, s, geological, survey, described, the, main, features, of, island, arc, subduction, in, the, aleutian, islands, his, paper, though, little, noted, and, sometimes, even, ridiculed, at, the, time, has, since, been, called, seminal, and, prescient, in, reality, it, shows, that, the, work, by, the, european, scientists, on, island, arcs, and, mountain, belts, performed, and, published, during, the, 1930s, up, until, the, 1950s, was, applied, and, appreciated, also, in, the, united, states, if, earth, s, crust, was, expanding, along, the, oceanic, ridges, hess, and, dietz, reasoned, like, holmes, and, others, before, them, it, must, be, shrinking, elsewhere, hess, followed, heezen, suggesting, that, new, oceanic, crust, continuously, spreads, away, from, the, ridges, in, a, conveyor, belt, like, motion, and, using, the, mobilistic, concepts, developed, before, he, correctly, concluded, that, many, millions, of, years, later, the, oceanic, crust, eventually, descends, along, the, continental, margins, where, oceanic, trenches, very, deep, narrow, canyons, are, formed, e, g, along, the, rim, of, the, pacific, ocean, basin, the, important, step, hess, made, was, that, convection, currents, would, be, the, driving, force, in, this, process, arriving, at, the, same, conclusions, as, holmes, had, decades, before, with, the, only, difference, that, the, thinning, of, the, ocean, crust, was, performed, using, heezen, s, mechanism, of, spreading, along, the, ridges, hess, therefore, concluded, that, the, atlantic, ocean, was, expanding, while, the, pacific, ocean, was, shrinking, as, old, oceanic, crust, is, consumed, in, the, trenches, like, holmes, and, others, he, thought, this, was, done, by, thickening, of, the, continental, lithosphere, not, as, later, understood, by, underthrusting, at, a, larger, scale, of, the, oceanic, crust, itself, into, the, mantle, new, magma, rises, and, erupts, along, the, spreading, ridges, to, form, new, crust, in, effect, the, ocean, basins, are, perpetually, being, recycled, with, the, forming, of, new, crust, and, the, destruction, of, old, oceanic, lithosphere, occurring, simultaneously, thus, the, new, mobilistic, concepts, neatly, explained, why, earth, does, not, get, bigger, with, sea, floor, spreading, why, there, is, so, little, sediment, accumulation, on, the, ocean, floor, and, why, oceanic, rocks, are, much, younger, than, continental, rocks, beginning, in, the, 1950s, scientists, like, victor, vacquier, using, magnetic, instruments, magnetometers, adapted, from, airborne, devices, developed, during, world, war, ii, to, detect, submarines, began, recognizing, odd, magnetic, variations, across, the, ocean, floor, this, finding, though, unexpected, was, not, entirely, surprising, because, it, was, known, that, basalt, the, iron, rich, volcanic, rock, making, up, the, ocean, floor, contains, a, strongly, magnetic, mineral, magnetite, and, can, locally, distort, compass, readings, this, distortion, was, recognized, by, icelandic, mariners, as, early, as, the, late, 18th, century, more, importantly, because, the, presence, of, magnetite, gives, the, basalt, measurable, magnetic, properties, these, newly, discovered, magnetic, variations, provided, another, means, to, study, the, deep, ocean, floor, when, newly, formed, rock, cools, such, magnetic, materials, recorded, earth, s, magnetic, field, at, the, time, as, more, and, more, of, the, seafloor, was, mapped, during, the, 1950s, the, magnetic, variations, turned, out, not, to, be, random, or, isolated, occurrences, but, instead, revealed, recognizable, patterns, when, these, magnetic, patterns, were, mapped, over, a, wide, region, the, ocean, floor, showed, a, zebra, like, pattern, one, stripe, with, normal, polarity, and, the, adjoining, stripe, with, reversed, polarity, the, overall, pattern, defined, by, these, alternating, bands, of, normally, and, reversely, polarized, rock, became, known, as, magnetic, striping, and, was, published, by, ron, g, mason, and, co, workers, in, 1961, who, did, not, find, though, an, explanation, for, these, data, in, terms, of, sea, floor, spreading, like, vine, matthews, and, morley, a, few, years, later, the, discovery, of, magnetic, striping, called, for, an, explanation, in, the, early, 1960s, scientists, such, as, heezen, hess, and, dietz, had, begun, to, theorise, that, mid, ocean, ridges, mark, structurally, weak, zones, where, the, ocean, floor, was, being, ripped, in, two, lengthwise, along, the, ridge, crest, see, the, previous, paragraph, new, magma, from, deep, within, earth, rises, easily, through, these, weak, zones, and, eventually, erupts, along, the, crest, of, the, ridges, to, create, new, oceanic, crust, this, process, at, first, denominated, the, conveyer, belt, hypothesis, and, later, called, seafloor, spreading, operating, over, many, millions, of, years, continues, to, form, new, ocean, floor, all, across, the, 50, 000, km, long, system, of, mid, ocean, ridges, only, four, years, after, the, maps, with, the, zebra, pattern, of, magnetic, stripes, were, published, the, link, between, sea, floor, spreading, and, these, patterns, was, recognized, independently, by, lawrence, morley, and, by, fred, vine, and, drummond, matthews, in, 1963, the, vine, matthews, morley, hypothesis, this, hypothesis, linked, these, patterns, to, geomagnetic, reversals, and, was, supported, by, several, lines, of, evidence, by, explaining, both, the, zebra, like, magnetic, striping, and, the, construction, of, the, mid, ocean, ridge, system, the, seafloor, spreading, hypothesis, sfs, quickly, gained, converts, and, represented, another, major, advance, in, the, development, of, the, plate, tectonics, theory, furthermore, the, oceanic, crust, came, to, be, appreciated, as, a, natural, tape, recording, of, the, history, of, the, geomagnetic, field, reversals, gmfr, of, earth, s, magnetic, field, extensive, studies, were, dedicated, to, the, calibration, of, the, normal, reversal, patterns, in, the, oceanic, crust, on, one, hand, and, known, timescales, derived, from, the, dating, of, basalt, layers, in, sedimentary, sequences, magnetostratigraphy, on, the, other, to, arrive, at, estimates, of, past, spreading, rates, and, plate, reconstructions, after, all, these, considerations, plate, tectonics, or, as, it, was, initially, called, new, global, tectonics, became, quickly, accepted, and, numerous, papers, followed, that, defined, the, concepts, continental, drift, theory, helps, biogeographers, to, explain, the, disjunct, biogeographic, distribution, of, present, day, life, found, on, different, continents, but, having, similar, ancestors, in, particular, it, explains, the, gondwanan, distribution, of, ratites, and, the, antarctic, flora,

paleogeography, active, plate, boundaries, are, defined, by, their, seismicity, past, plate, boundaries, within, existing, plates, are, identified, from, a, variety, of, evidence, such, as, the, presence, of, ophiolites, that, are, indicative, of, vanished, oceans, tectonic, motion, is, believed, to, have, begun, around, 3, to, 3, 8, billion, years, ago, various, types, of, quantitative, and, semi, quantitative, information, are, available, to, constrain, past, plate, motions, the, geometric, fit, between, continents, such, as, between, west, africa, and, south, america, is, still, an, important, part, of, plate, reconstruction, magnetic, stripe, patterns, provide, a, reliable, guide, to, relative, plate, motions, going, back, into, the, jurassic, period, the, tracks, of, hotspots, give, absolute, reconstructions, but, these, are, only, available, back, to, the, cretaceous, older, reconstructions, rely, mainly, on, paleomagnetic, pole, data, although, these, only, constrain, the, latitude, and, rotation, but, not, the, longitude, combining, poles, of, different, ages, in, a, particular, plate, to, produce, apparent, polar, wander, paths, provides, a, method, for, comparing, the, motions, of, different, plates, through, time, additional, evidence, comes, from, the, distribution, of, certain, sedimentary, rock, types, faunal, provinces, shown, by, particular, fossil, groups, and, the, position, of, orogenic, belts, the, movement, of, plates, has, caused, the, formation, and, break, up, of, continents, over, time, including, occasional, formation, of, a, supercontinent, that, contains, most, or, all, of, the, continents, the, supercontinent, columbia, or, nuna, formed, during, a, period, of, 2, 000, to, 1, 800, million, years, ago, and, broke, up, about, 1, 500, to, 1, 300, million, years, ago, the, supercontinent, rodinia, is, thought, to, have, formed, about, 1, billion, years, ago, and, to, have, embodied, most, or, all, of, earth, s, continents, and, broken, up, into, eight, continents, around, 600, million, years, ago, the, eight, continents, later, re, assembled, into, another, supercontinent, called, pangaea, pangaea, broke, up, into, laurasia, which, became, north, america, and, eurasia, and, gondwana, which, became, the, remaining, continents, the, himalayas, the, world, s, tallest, mountain, range, are, assumed, to, have, been, formed, by, the, collision, of, two, major, plates, before, uplift, the, area, where, they, stand, was, covered, by, the, tethys, ocean, depending, on, how, they, are, defined, there, are, usually, seven, or, eight, major, plates, african, antarctic, eurasian, north, american, south, american, pacific, and, indo, australian, the, latter, is, sometimes, subdivided, into, the, indian, and, australian, plates, there, are, dozens, of, smaller, plates, the, eight, largest, of, which, are, the, arabian, caribbean, juan, de, fuca, cocos, nazca, philippine, sea, scotia, and, somali, during, the, 2020s, new, proposals, have, come, forward, that, divide, the, earth, s, crust, into, many, smaller, plates, called, terranes, which, reflects, the, fact, that, plate, reconstructions, show, that, the, larger, plates, have, been, internally, deformed, and, oceanic, and, continental, plates, have, been, fragmented, over, time, this, has, resulted, in, the, definition, of, roughly, 1200, terranes, inside, the, oceanic, plates, continental, blocks, and, the, mobile, zones, mountainous, belts, that, separate, them, the, motion, of, the, tectonic, plates, is, determined, by, remote, sensing, satellite, data, sets, calibrated, with, ground, station, measurements, the, appearance, of, plate, tectonics, on, terrestrial, planets, is, related, to, planetary, mass, with, more, massive, planets, than, earth, expected, to, exhibit, plate, tectonics, earth, may, be, a, borderline, case, owing, its, tectonic, activity, to, abundant, water, silica, and, water, form, a, deep, eutectic, venus, shows, no, evidence, of, active, plate, tectonics, there, is, debatable, evidence, of, active, tectonics, in, the, planet, s, distant, past, however, events, taking, place, since, then, such, as, the, plausible, and, generally, accepted, hypothesis, that, the, venusian, lithosphere, has, thickened, greatly, over, the, course, of, several, hundred, million, years, has, made, constraining, the, course, of, its, geologic, record, difficult, however, the, numerous, well, preserved, impact, craters, have, been, used, as, a, dating, method, to, approximately, date, the, venusian, surface, since, there, are, thus, far, no, known, samples, of, venusian, rock, to, be, dated, by, more, reliable, methods, dates, derived, are, dominantly, in, the, range, 500, to, 750, million, years, ago, although, ages, of, up, to, 1, 200, million, years, ago, have, been, calculated, this, research, has, led, to, the, fairly, well, accepted, hypothesis, that, venus, has, undergone, an, essentially, complete, volcanic, resurfacing, at, least, once, in, its, distant, past, with, the, last, event, taking, place, approximately, within, the, range, of, estimated, surface, ages, while, the, mechanism, of, such, an, impressive, thermal, event, remains, a, debated, issue, in, venusian, geosciences, some, scientists, are, advocates, of, processes, involving, plate, motion, to, some, extent, one, explanation, for, venus, s, lack, of, plate, tectonics, is, that, on, venus, temperatures, are, too, high, for, significant, water, to, be, present, earth, s, crust, is, soaked, with, water, and, water, plays, an, important, role, in, the, development, of, shear, zones, plate, tectonics, requires, weak, surfaces, in, the, crust, along, which, crustal, slices, can, move, and, it, may, well, be, that, such, weakening, never, took, place, on, venus, because, of, the, absence, of, water, however, some, researchers, remain, convinced, that, plate, tectonics, is, or, was, once, active, on, this, planet, mars, is, considerably, smaller, than, earth, and, venus, and, there, is, evidence, for, ice, on, its, surface, and, in, its, crust, in, the, 1990s, it, was, proposed, that, martian, crustal, dichotomy, was, created, by, plate, tectonic, processes, scientists, have, since, determined, that, it, was, created, either, by, upwelling, within, the, martian, mantle, that, thickened, the, crust, of, the, southern, highlands, and, formed, tharsis, or, by, a, giant, impact, that, excavated, the, northern, lowlands, valles, marineris, may, be, a, tectonic, boundary, observations, made, of, the, magnetic, field, of, mars, by, the, mars, global, surveyor, spacecraft, in, 1999, showed, patterns, of, magnetic, striping, discovered, on, this, planet, some, scientists, interpreted, these, as, requiring, plate, tectonic, processes, such, as, seafloor, spreading, however, their, data, failed, a, magnetic, reversal, test, which, is, used, to, see, if, they, were, formed, by, flipping, polarities, of, a, global, magnetic, field, some, of, the, satellites, of, jupiter, have, features, that, may, be, related, to, plate, tectonic, style, deformation, although, the, materials, and, specific, mechanisms, may, be, different, from, plate, tectonic, activity, on, earth, on, 8, september, 2014, nasa, reported, finding, evidence, of, plate, tectonics, on, europa, a, satellite, of, jupiter, the, first, sign, of, subduction, activity, on, another, world, other, than, earth, titan, the, largest, moon, of, saturn, was, reported, to, show, tectonic, activity, in, images, taken, by, the, huygens, probe, which, landed, on, titan, on, january, 14, 2005, on, earth, sized, planets, plate, tectonics, is, more, likely, if, there, are, oceans, of, water, however, in, 2007, two, independent, teams, of, researchers, came, to, opposing, conclusions, about, the, likelihood, of, plate, tectonics, on, larger, super, earths, with, one, team, saying, that, plate, tectonics, would, be, episodic, or, stagnant, and, the, other, team, saying, that, plate, tectonics, is, very, likely, on, super, earths, even, if, the, planet, is, dry, consideration, of, plate, tectonics, is, a, part, of, the, search, for, extraterrestrial, intelligence, and, extraterrestrial, life, videos
