metallic, bonding, is, a, type, of, chemical, bonding, that, arises, from, the, electrostatic, attractive, force, between, conduction, electrons, in, the, form, of, an, electron, cloud, of, delocalized, electrons, and, positively, charged, metal, ions, it, may, be, described, as, the, sharing, of, free, electrons, among, a, structure, of, positively, charged, ions, cations, metallic, bonding, accounts, for, many, physical, properties, of, metals, such, as, strength, ductility, thermal, and, electrical, resistivity, and, conductivity, opacity, and, lustre, metallic, bonding, is, not, the, only, type, of, chemical, bonding, a, metal, can, exhibit, even, as, a, pure, substance, for, example, elemental, gallium, consists, of, covalently, bound, pairs, of, atoms, in, both, liquid, and, solid, state, these, pairs, form, a, crystal, structure, with, metallic, bonding, between, them, another, example, of, a, metal, metal, covalent, bond, is, the, mercurous, ion, hg, 2, 2, as, chemistry, developed, into, a, science, it, became, clear, that, metals, formed, the, majority, of, the, periodic, table, of, the, elements, and, great, progress, was, made, in, the, description, of, the, salts, that, can, be, formed, in, reactions, with, acids, with, the, advent, of, electrochemistry, it, became, clear, that, metals, generally, go, into, solution, as, positively, charged, ions, and, the, oxidation, reactions, of, the, metals, became, well, understood, in, their, electrochemical, series, a, picture, emerged, of, metals, as, positive, ions, held, together, by, an, ocean, of, negative, electrons, with, the, advent, of, quantum, mechanics, this, picture, was, given, a, more, formal, interpretation, in, the, form, of, the, free, electron, model, and, its, further, extension, the, nearly, free, electron, model, in, both, models, the, electrons, are, seen, as, a, gas, traveling, through, the, structure, of, the, solid, with, an, energy, that, is, essentially, isotropic, in, that, it, depends, on, the, square, of, the, magnitude, not, the, direction, of, the, momentum, vector, k, in, three, dimensional, k, space, the, set, of, points, of, the, highest, filled, levels, the, fermi, surface, should, therefore, be, a, sphere, in, the, nearly, free, model, box, like, brillouin, zones, are, added, to, k, space, by, the, periodic, potential, experienced, from, the, ionic, structure, thus, mildly, breaking, the, isotropy, the, advent, of, x, ray, diffraction, and, thermal, analysis, made, it, possible, to, study, the, structure, of, crystalline, solids, including, metals, and, their, alloys, and, phase, diagrams, were, developed, despite, all, this, progress, the, nature, of, intermetallic, compounds, and, alloys, largely, remained, a, mystery, and, their, study, was, often, merely, empirical, chemists, generally, steered, away, from, anything, that, did, not, seem, to, follow, dalton, s, laws, of, multiple, proportions, and, the, problem, was, considered, the, domain, of, a, different, science, metallurgy, the, nearly, free, electron, model, was, eagerly, taken, up, by, some, researchers, in, metallurgy, notably, hume, rothery, in, an, attempt, to, explain, why, intermetallic, alloys, with, certain, compositions, would, form, and, others, would, not, initially, hume, rothery, s, attempts, were, quite, successful, his, idea, was, to, add, electrons, to, inflate, the, spherical, fermi, balloon, inside, the, series, of, brillouin, boxes, and, determine, when, a, certain, box, would, be, full, this, predicted, a, fairly, large, number, of, alloy, compositions, that, were, later, observed, as, soon, as, cyclotron, resonance, became, available, and, the, shape, of, the, balloon, could, be, determined, it, was, found, that, the, balloon, was, not, spherical, as, the, hume, rothery, believed, except, perhaps, in, the, case, of, caesium, this, revealed, how, a, model, can, sometimes, give, a, whole, series, of, correct, predictions, yet, still, be, wrong, in, its, basic, assumptions, the, nearly, free, electron, debacle, compelled, researchers, to, modify, the, assumpition, that, ions, flowed, in, a, sea, of, free, electrons, a, number, of, quantum, mechanical, models, were, developed, such, as, band, structure, calculations, based, on, molecular, orbitals, and, the, density, functional, theory, these, models, either, depart, from, the, atomic, orbitals, of, neutral, atoms, that, share, their, electrons, or, in, the, case, of, density, functional, theory, departs, from, the, total, electron, density, the, free, electron, picture, has, nevertheless, remained, a, dominant, one, in, introductory, courses, on, metallurgy, the, electronic, band, structure, model, became, a, major, focus, for, the, study, of, metals, and, even, more, of, semiconductors, together, with, the, electronic, states, the, vibrational, states, were, also, shown, to, form, bands, rudolf, peierls, showed, that, in, the, case, of, a, one, dimensional, row, of, metallic, atoms, say, hydrogen, an, inevitable, instability, would, break, such, a, chain, into, individual, molecules, this, sparked, an, interest, in, the, general, question, when, is, collective, metallic, bonding, stable, and, when, will, a, localized, bonding, take, its, place, much, research, went, into, the, study, of, clustering, of, metal, atoms, as, powerful, as, the, band, structure, model, proved, to, be, in, describing, metallic, bonding, it, remains, a, one, electron, approximation, of, a, many, body, problem, the, energy, states, of, an, individual, electron, are, described, as, if, all, the, other, electrons, form, a, homogeneous, background, researchers, such, as, mott, and, hubbard, realized, that, the, one, electron, treatment, was, perhaps, appropriate, for, strongly, delocalized, s, and, p, electrons, but, for, d, electrons, and, even, more, for, f, electrons, the, interaction, with, nearby, individual, electrons, and, atomic, displacements, may, become, stronger, than, the, delocalized, interaction, that, leads, to, broad, bands, this, gave, a, better, explanation, for, the, transition, from, localized, unpaired, electrons, to, itinerant, ones, partaking, in, metallic, bonding, the, combination, of, two, phenomena, gives, rise, to, metallic, bonding, delocalization, of, electrons, and, the, availability, of, a, far, larger, number, of, delocalized, energy, states, than, of, delocalized, electrons, the, latter, could, be, called, electron, deficiency, graphene, is, an, example, of, two, dimensional, metallic, bonding, its, metallic, bonds, are, similar, to, aromatic, bonding, in, benzene, naphthalene, anthracene, ovalene, etc, metal, aromaticity, in, metal, clusters, is, another, example, of, delocalization, this, time, often, in, three, dimensional, arrangements, metals, take, the, delocalization, principle, to, its, extreme, and, one, could, say, that, a, crystal, of, a, metal, represents, a, single, molecule, over, which, all, conduction, electrons, are, delocalized, in, all, three, dimensions, this, means, that, inside, the, metal, one, can, generally, not, distinguish, molecules, so, that, the, metallic, bonding, is, neither, intra, nor, inter, molecular, nonmolecular, would, perhaps, be, a, better, term, metallic, bonding, is, mostly, non, polar, because, even, in, alloys, there, is, little, difference, among, the, electronegativities, of, the, atoms, participating, in, the, bonding, interaction, and, in, pure, elemental, metals, none, at, all, thus, metallic, bonding, is, an, extremely, delocalized, communal, form, of, covalent, bonding, in, a, sense, metallic, bonding, is, not, a, new, type, of, bonding, at, all, it, describes, the, bonding, only, as, present, in, a, chunk, of, condensed, matter, be, it, crystalline, solid, liquid, or, even, glass, metallic, vapors, in, contrast, are, often, atomic, hg, or, at, times, contain, molecules, such, as, na, 2, held, together, by, a, more, conventional, covalent, bond, this, is, why, it, is, not, correct, to, speak, of, a, single, metallic, bond, delocalization, is, most, pronounced, for, s, and, p, electrons, delocalization, in, caesium, is, so, strong, that, the, electrons, are, virtually, freed, from, the, caesium, atoms, to, form, a, gas, constrained, only, by, the, surface, of, the, metal, for, caesium, therefore, the, picture, of, cs, ions, held, together, by, a, negatively, charged, electron, gas, is, very, close, to, accurate, though, not, perfectly, so, for, other, elements, the, electrons, are, less, free, in, that, they, still, experience, the, potential, of, the, metal, atoms, sometimes, quite, strongly, they, require, a, more, intricate, quantum, mechanical, treatment, e, g, tight, binding, in, which, the, atoms, are, viewed, as, neutral, much, like, the, carbon, atoms, in, benzene, for, d, and, especially, f, electrons, the, delocalization, is, not, strong, at, all, and, this, explains, why, these, electrons, are, able, to, continue, behaving, as, unpaired, electrons, that, retain, their, spin, adding, interesting, magnetic, properties, to, these, metals, metal, atoms, contain, few, electrons, in, their, valence, shells, relative, to, their, periods, or, energy, levels, they, are, electron, deficient, elements, and, the, communal, sharing, does, not, change, that, there, remain, far, more, available, energy, states, than, there, are, shared, electrons, both, requirements, for, conductivity, are, therefore, fulfilled, strong, delocalization, and, partly, filled, energy, bands, such, electrons, can, therefore, easily, change, from, one, energy, state, to, a, slightly, different, one, thus, not, only, do, they, become, delocalized, forming, a, sea, of, electrons, permeating, the, structure, but, they, are, also, able, to, migrate, through, the, structure, when, an, external, electrical, field, is, applied, leading, to, electrical, conductivity, without, the, field, there, are, electrons, moving, equally, in, all, directions, within, such, a, field, some, electrons, will, adjust, their, state, slightly, adopting, a, different, wave, vector, consequently, there, will, be, more, moving, one, way, than, another, and, a, net, current, will, result, the, freedom, of, electrons, to, migrate, also, gives, metal, atoms, or, layers, of, them, the, capacity, to, slide, past, each, other, locally, bonds, can, easily, be, broken, and, replaced, by, new, ones, after, a, deformation, this, process, does, not, affect, the, communal, metallic, bonding, very, much, which, gives, rise, to, metals, characteristic, malleability, and, ductility, this, is, particularly, true, for, pure, elements, in, the, presence, of, dissolved, impurities, the, normally, easily, formed, cleavages, may, be, blocked, and, the, material, become, harder, gold, for, example, is, very, soft, in, pure, form, 24, karat, which, is, why, alloys, are, preferred, in, jewelry, metals, are, typically, also, good, conductors, of, heat, but, the, conduction, electrons, only, contribute, partly, to, this, phenomenon, collective, i, e, delocalized, vibrations, of, the, atoms, known, as, phonons, that, travel, through, the, solid, as, a, wave, are, bigger, contributors, however, a, substance, such, as, diamond, which, conducts, heat, quite, well, is, not, an, electrical, conductor, this, is, not, a, consequence, of, delocalization, being, absent, in, diamond, but, simply, that, carbon, is, not, electron, deficient, electron, deficiency, is, important, in, distinguishing, metallic, from, more, conventional, covalent, bonding, thus, we, should, amend, the, expression, given, above, to, metallic, bonding, is, an, extremely, delocalized, communal, form, of, electron, deficient, covalent, bonding, the, metallic, radius, is, defined, as, one, half, of, the, distance, between, the, two, adjacent, metal, ions, in, the, metallic, structure, this, radius, depends, on, the, nature, of, the, atom, as, well, as, its, environment, specifically, on, the, coordination, number, cn, which, in, turn, depends, on, the, temperature, and, applied, pressure, when, comparing, periodic, trends, in, the, size, of, atoms, it, is, often, desirable, to, apply, the, so, called, goldschmidt, correction, which, converts, atomic, radii, to, the, values, the, atoms, would, have, if, they, were, 12, coordinated, since, metallic, radii, are, largest, for, the, highest, coordination, number, correction, for, less, dense, coordinations, involves, multiplying, by, x, where, 0, x, 1, specifically, for, cn, 4, x, 0, 88, for, cn, 6, x, 0, 96, and, for, cn, 8, x, 0, 97, the, correction, is, named, after, victor, goldschmidt, who, obtained, the, numerical, values, quoted, above, the, radii, follow, general, periodic, trends, they, decrease, across, the, period, due, to, the, increase, in, the, effective, nuclear, charge, which, is, not, offset, by, the, increased, number, of, valence, electrons, but, the, radii, increase, down, the, group, due, to, an, increase, in, the, principal, quantum, number, between, the, 4, d, and, 5, d, elements, the, lanthanide, contraction, is, observed, there, is, very, little, increase, of, the, radius, down, the, group, due, to, the, presence, of, poorly, shielding, f, orbitals, the, atoms, in, metals, have, a, strong, attractive, force, between, them, much, energy, is, required, to, overcome, it, therefore, metals, often, have, high, boiling, points, with, tungsten, 5828, k, being, extremely, high, a, remarkable, exception, is, the, elements, of, the, zinc, group, zn, cd, and, hg, their, electron, configurations, end, in, n, s, 2, which, resembles, a, noble, gas, configuration, like, that, of, helium, more, and, more, when, going, down, the, periodic, table, because, the, energy, differential, to, the, empty, n, p, orbitals, becomes, larger, these, metals, are, therefore, relatively, volatile, and, are, avoided, in, ultra, high, vacuum, systems, otherwise, metallic, bonding, can, be, very, strong, even, in, molten, metals, such, as, gallium, even, though, gallium, will, melt, from, the, heat, of, one, s, hand, just, above, room, temperature, its, boiling, point, is, not, far, from, that, of, copper, molten, gallium, is, therefore, a, very, nonvolatile, liquid, thanks, to, its, strong, metallic, bonding, the, strong, bonding, of, metals, in, liquid, form, demonstrates, that, the, energy, of, a, metallic, bond, is, not, highly, dependent, on, the, direction, of, the, bond, this, lack, of, bond, directionality, is, a, direct, consequence, of, electron, delocalization, and, is, best, understood, in, contrast, to, the, directional, bonding, of, covalent, bonds, the, energy, of, a, metallic, bond, is, thus, mostly, a, function, of, the, number, of, electrons, which, surround, the, metallic, atom, as, exemplified, by, the, embedded, atom, model, this, typically, results, in, metals, assuming, relatively, simple, close, packed, crystal, structures, such, as, fcc, bcc, and, hcp, given, high, enough, cooling, rates, and, appropriate, alloy, composition, metallic, bonding, can, occur, even, in, glasses, which, have, amorphous, structures, much, biochemistry, is, mediated, by, the, weak, interaction, of, metal, ions, and, biomolecules, such, interactions, and, their, associated, conformational, changes, have, been, measured, using, dual, polarisation, interferometry, metals, are, insoluble, in, water, or, organic, solvents, unless, they, undergo, a, reaction, with, them, typically, this, is, an, oxidation, reaction, that, robs, the, metal, atoms, of, their, itinerant, electrons, destroying, the, metallic, bonding, however, metals, are, often, readily, soluble, in, each, other, while, retaining, the, metallic, character, of, their, bonding, gold, for, example, dissolves, easily, in, mercury, even, at, room, temperature, even, in, solid, metals, the, solubility, can, be, extensive, if, the, structures, of, the, two, metals, are, the, same, there, can, even, be, complete, solid, solubility, as, in, the, case, of, electrum, an, alloy, of, silver, and, gold, at, times, however, two, metals, will, form, alloys, with, different, structures, than, either, of, the, two, parents, one, could, call, these, materials, metal, compounds, but, because, materials, with, metallic, bonding, are, typically, not, molecular, dalton, s, law, of, integral, proportions, is, not, valid, and, often, a, range, of, stoichiometric, ratios, can, be, achieved, it, is, better, to, abandon, such, concepts, as, pure, substance, or, solute, in, such, cases, and, speak, of, phases, instead, the, study, of, such, phases, has, traditionally, been, more, the, domain, of, metallurgy, than, of, chemistry, although, the, two, fields, overlap, considerably, the, metallic, bonding, in, complex, compounds, does, not, necessarily, involve, all, constituent, elements, equally, it, is, quite, possible, to, have, one, or, more, elements, that, do, not, partake, at, all, one, could, picture, the, conduction, electrons, flowing, around, them, like, a, river, around, an, island, or, a, big, rock, it, is, possible, to, observe, which, elements, do, partake, e, g, by, looking, at, the, core, levels, in, an, x, ray, photoelectron, spectroscopy, xps, spectrum, if, an, element, partakes, its, peaks, tend, to, be, skewed, some, intermetallic, materials, e, g, do, exhibit, metal, clusters, reminiscent, of, molecules, and, these, compounds, are, more, a, topic, of, chemistry, than, of, metallurgy, the, formation, of, the, clusters, could, be, seen, as, a, way, to, condense, out, localize, the, electron, deficient, bonding, into, bonds, of, a, more, localized, nature, hydrogen, is, an, extreme, example, of, this, form, of, condensation, at, high, pressures, it, is, a, metal, the, core, of, the, planet, jupiter, could, be, said, to, be, held, together, by, a, combination, of, metallic, bonding, and, high, pressure, induced, by, gravity, at, lower, pressures, however, the, bonding, becomes, entirely, localized, into, a, regular, covalent, bond, the, localization, is, so, complete, that, the, more, familiar, h, 2, gas, results, a, similar, argument, holds, for, an, element, such, as, boron, though, it, is, electron, deficient, compared, to, carbon, it, does, not, form, a, metal, instead, it, has, a, number, of, complex, structures, in, which, icosahedral, b, 12, clusters, dominate, charge, density, waves, are, a, related, phenomenon, as, these, phenomena, involve, the, movement, of, the, atoms, toward, or, away, from, each, other, they, can, be, interpreted, as, the, coupling, between, the, electronic, and, the, vibrational, states, i, e, the, phonons, of, the, material, a, different, such, electron, phonon, interaction, is, thought, to, lead, to, a, very, different, result, at, low, temperatures, that, of, superconductivity, rather, than, blocking, the, mobility, of, the, charge, carriers, by, forming, electron, pairs, in, localized, bonds, cooper, pairs, are, formed, that, no, longer, experience, any, resistance, to, their, mobility, the, presence, of, an, ocean, of, mobile, charge, carriers, has, profound, effects, on, the, optical, properties, of, metals, which, can, only, be, understood, by, considering, the, electrons, as, a, collective, rather, than, considering, the, states, of, individual, electrons, involved, in, more, conventional, covalent, bonds, light, consists, of, a, combination, of, an, electrical, and, a, magnetic, field, the, electrical, field, is, usually, able, to, excite, an, elastic, response, from, the, electrons, involved, in, the, metallic, bonding, the, result, is, that, photons, cannot, penetrate, very, far, into, the, metal, and, are, typically, reflected, although, some, may, also, be, absorbed, this, holds, equally, for, all, photons, in, the, visible, spectrum, which, is, why, metals, are, often, silvery, white, or, grayish, with, the, characteristic, specular, reflection, of, metallic, lustre, the, balance, between, reflection, and, absorption, determines, how, white, or, how, gray, a, metal, is, although, surface, tarnish, can, obscure, the, lustre, silver, a, metal, with, high, conductivity, is, one, of, the, whitest, notable, exceptions, are, reddish, copper, and, yellowish, gold, the, reason, for, their, color, is, that, there, is, an, upper, limit, to, the, frequency, of, the, light, that, metallic, electrons, can, readily, respond, to, the, plasmon, frequency, at, the, plasmon, frequency, the, frequency, dependent, dielectric, function, of, the, free, electron, gas, goes, from, negative, reflecting, to, positive, transmitting, higher, frequency, photons, are, not, reflected, at, the, surface, and, do, not, contribute, to, the, color, of, the, metal, there, are, some, materials, such, as, indium, tin, oxide, ito, that, are, metallic, conductors, actually, degenerate, semiconductors, for, which, this, threshold, is, in, the, infrared, which, is, why, they, are, transparent, in, the, visible, but, good, reflectors, in, the, infrared, for, silver, the, limiting, frequency, is, in, the, far, ultraviolet, but, for, copper, and, gold, it, is, closer, to, the, visible, this, explains, the, colors, of, these, two, metals, at, the, surface, of, a, metal, resonance, effects, known, as, surface, plasmons, can, result, they, are, collective, oscillations, of, the, conduction, electrons, like, a, ripple, in, the, electronic, ocean, however, even, if, photons, have, enough, energy, they, usually, do, not, have, enough, momentum, to, set, the, ripple, in, motion, therefore, plasmons, are, hard, to, excite, on, a, bulk, metal, this, is, why, gold, and, copper, look, like, lustrous, metals, albeit, with, a, dash, of, color, however, in, colloidal, gold, the, metallic, bonding, is, confined, to, a, tiny, metallic, particle, which, prevents, the, oscillation, wave, of, the, plasmon, from, running, away, the, momentum, selection, rule, is, therefore, broken, and, the, plasmon, resonance, causes, an, extremely, intense, absorption, in, the, green, with, a, resulting, purple, red, color, such, colors, are, orders, of, magnitude, more, intense, than, ordinary, absorptions, seen, in, dyes, and, the, like, which, involve, individual, electrons, and, their, energy, states
