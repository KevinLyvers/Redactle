https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassland
a, grassland, is, an, area, where, the, vegetation, is, dominated, by, grasses, poaceae, however, sedge, cyperaceae, and, rush, juncaceae, can, also, be, found, along, with, variable, proportions, of, legumes, like, clover, and, other, herbs, grasslands, occur, naturally, on, all, continents, except, antarctica, and, are, found, in, most, ecoregions, of, the, earth, furthermore, grasslands, are, one, of, the, largest, biomes, on, earth, and, dominate, the, landscape, worldwide, there, are, different, types, of, grasslands, natural, grasslands, semi, natural, grasslands, and, agricultural, grasslands, they, cover, 31, 69, of, the, earth, s, land, area, included, among, the, variety, of, definitions, for, grasslands, are, semi, natural, grasslands, are, a, very, common, subcategory, of, the, grasslands, biome, these, can, be, defined, as, they, can, also, be, described, as, the, following, there, are, many, different, types, of, semi, natural, grasslands, e, g, hay, meadows, the, graminoids, are, among, the, most, versatile, life, forms, they, became, widespread, toward, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, period, and, coprolites, of, fossilized, dinosaur, feces, have, been, found, containing, phytoliths, of, a, variety, of, grasses, that, include, grasses, that, are, related, to, modern, rice, and, bamboo, the, appearance, of, mountains, in, the, western, united, states, during, the, miocene, and, pliocene, epochs, a, period, of, some, 25, million, years, created, a, continental, climate, favourable, to, the, evolution, of, grasslands, around, 5, million, years, ago, during, the, late, miocene, in, the, new, world, and, the, pliocene, in, the, old, world, the, first, true, grasslands, occurred, existing, forest, biomes, declined, and, grasslands, became, much, more, widespread, it, is, known, that, grasslands, have, existed, in, europe, throughout, the, pleistocene, the, last, 1, 8, million, years, following, the, pleistocene, ice, ages, with, their, glacials, and, interglacials, grasslands, expanded, in, the, hotter, drier, climates, and, began, to, become, the, dominant, land, feature, worldwide, since, the, grasslands, have, existed, for, over, 1, 8, million, years, there, is, high, variability, for, example, steppe, tundra, dominated, in, northern, and, central, europe, whereas, a, higher, amount, of, xerothermic, grasslands, occurred, in, the, mediterranean, area, within, temperate, europe, the, range, of, types, is, quite, wide, and, also, became, unique, due, to, the, exchange, of, species, and, genetic, material, between, different, biomes, the, semi, natural, grasslands, first, appeared, when, humans, started, farming, so, for, the, use, of, agriculture, forests, got, cleared, in, europe, ancient, meadows, and, pastures, were, the, parts, that, were, suitable, for, cultivation, the, semi, natural, grasslands, were, formed, from, these, areas, however, there, s, also, evidence, for, the, local, persistence, of, natural, grasslands, in, europe, originally, maintained, by, wild, herbivores, throughout, the, pre, neolithic, holocene, the, removal, of, the, plants, by, the, grazing, animals, and, later, the, mowing, farmers, led, to, co, existence, of, other, plant, species, around, in, the, following, the, biodiversity, of, the, plants, evolve, also, the, species, that, already, lived, there, adapted, to, the, new, conditions, most, of, the, grassland, areas, have, been, turned, to, arable, fields, and, disappeared, again, the, grasslands, permanently, became, arable, cropping, fields, due, to, the, steady, decrease, in, organic, matter, nowadays, semi, natural, grasslands, are, rather, located, in, areas, that, are, unsuitable, for, agricultural, farming, grasslands, dominated, by, unsown, wild, plant, communities, unimproved, grasslands, can, be, called, either, natural, or, semi, natural, habitat, although, their, plant, communities, are, natural, their, maintenance, depends, upon, anthropogenic, activities, such, as, grazing, and, cutting, regimes, the, semi, natural, grasslands, contain, many, species, of, wild, plants, including, grasses, sedges, rushes, and, herbs, 25, plant, species, per, 100, square, centimeters, can, be, found, a, european, record, that, was, found, on, a, meadow, in, estonia, described, 76, species, of, plants, in, one, square, meter, chalk, downlands, in, england, can, support, over, 40, species, per, square, meter, in, many, parts, of, the, world, few, examples, have, escaped, agricultural, improvement, fertilizing, weed, killing, plowing, or, re, seeding, for, example, original, north, american, prairie, grasslands, or, lowland, wildflower, meadows, in, the, uk, are, now, rare, and, their, associated, wild, flora, equally, threatened, associated, with, the, wild, plant, diversity, of, the, unimproved, grasslands, is, usually, a, rich, invertebrate, fauna, there, are, also, many, species, of, birds, that, are, grassland, specialists, such, as, the, snipe, and, the, little, bustard, owing, to, semi, natural, grasslands, being, referred, to, as, one, of, the, most, species, rich, ecosystems, in, the, world, and, essential, habitat, for, many, specialists, also, including, pollinators, there, are, many, approaches, to, conservation, activities, lately, agriculturally, improved, grasslands, which, dominate, modern, intensive, agricultural, landscapes, are, usually, poor, in, wild, plant, species, due, to, the, original, diversity, of, plants, having, been, destroyed, by, cultivation, and, by, the, use, of, fertilizers, almost, 90, of, the, european, semi, natural, grasslands, do, not, exist, anymore, due, to, political, and, economic, reasons, this, loss, took, place, during, the, 20th, century, the, ones, in, western, and, central, europe, have, almost, disappeared, completely, there, are, a, few, left, in, northern, europe, unfortunately, a, large, amount, of, red, listed, species, are, specialists, of, semi, natural, grasslands, and, are, affected, by, the, landscape, change, due, to, agriculture, of, the, last, century, the, original, wild, plant, communities, having, been, replaced, by, sown, monocultures, of, cultivated, varieties, of, grasses, and, clovers, such, as, perennial, ryegrass, and, white, clover, in, many, parts, of, the, world, unimproved, grasslands, are, one, of, the, most, threatened, types, of, habitat, and, a, target, for, acquisition, by, wildlife, conservation, groups, or, for, special, grants, to, landowners, who, are, encouraged, to, manage, them, appropriately, grassland, vegetation, can, vary, considerably, depending, on, the, grassland, type, and, on, how, strong, it, is, affected, by, human, impact, dominant, trees, for, the, semi, natural, grassland, are, quercus, robur, betula, pendula, corylus, avellana, crataegus, and, many, kinds, of, herbs, in, chalk, grassland, the, plants, can, vary, from, very, tall, to, very, short, quite, tall, grasses, can, be, found, in, north, american, tallgrass, prairie, south, american, grasslands, and, african, savanna, woody, plants, shrubs, or, trees, may, occur, on, some, grasslands, forming, savannas, scrubby, grassland, or, semi, wooded, grassland, such, as, the, african, savannas, or, the, iberian, deheza, as, flowering, plants, and, trees, grasses, grow, in, great, concentrations, in, climates, where, annual, rainfall, ranges, between, 500, and, 900, mm, 20, and, 35, in, the, root, systems, of, perennial, grasses, and, forbs, form, complex, mats, that, hold, the, soil, in, place, grasslands, support, the, greatest, aggregations, of, large, animals, on, earth, including, jaguars, african, wild, dogs, pronghorn, black, footed, ferret, plains, bison, mountain, plover, african, elephant, sunda, tiger, black, rhino, white, rhino, savanna, elephant, greater, one, horned, rhino, indian, elephant, and, swift, fox, grazing, animals, herd, animals, and, predators, in, grasslands, like, lions, and, cheetahs, live, in, the, grasslands, of, the, african, savanna, mites, insect, larvae, nematodes, and, earthworms, inhabit, deep, soil, which, can, reach, 6, metres, 20, feet, underground, in, undisturbed, grasslands, on, the, richest, soils, of, the, world, these, invertebrates, along, with, symbiotic, fungi, extend, the, root, systems, break, apart, hard, soil, enrich, it, with, urea, and, other, natural, fertilizers, trap, minerals, and, water, and, promote, growth, some, types, of, fungi, make, the, plants, more, resistant, to, insect, and, microbial, attacks, grassland, in, all, its, form, supports, a, vast, variety, of, mammals, reptiles, birds, and, insects, typical, large, mammals, include, the, blue, wildebeest, american, bison, giant, anteater, and, przewalski, s, horse, the, plants, and, animals, that, live, in, grasslands, are, connected, through, an, unlimited, web, of, interactions, but, the, removal, of, key, species, such, as, buffalo, and, prairie, dogs, within, the, american, west, and, introduction, of, invasive, species, like, cane, toads, in, northern, australia, have, disrupted, the, balance, in, these, ecosystems, and, damaged, a, number, of, other, species, grasslands, are, home, to, a, number, of, the, foremost, magnificent, animals, on, the, planet, elephants, bison, lions, and, hunters, have, found, them, to, be, enticing, prey, but, when, hunting, is, not, controlled, or, is, conducted, illegally, species, can, become, extinct, grasslands, provide, a, range, of, marketed, and, non, marketed, ecosystem, services, that, are, fundamental, to, the, livelihoods, of, an, estimated, one, billion, people, globally, grasslands, hold, about, twenty, percent, of, global, soil, carbon, stocks, herbaceous, non, wooded, vegetation, dominates, grasslands, and, carbon, is, stored, in, the, roots, and, soil, underground, above, ground, biomass, carbon, is, relatively, short, lived, due, to, grazing, fire, and, senescence, grassland, species, have, an, extensive, fibrous, root, system, with, grasses, often, accounting, for, 60, 80, of, the, biomass, carbon, in, this, ecosystem, this, underground, biomass, can, extend, several, meters, below, the, surface, and, store, abundant, carbon, into, the, soil, resulting, in, deep, fertile, soils, with, high, organic, matter, content, for, this, reason, soil, carbon, accounts, for, about, 81, of, the, total, ecosystem, carbon, in, grasslands, the, close, link, between, soil, carbon, and, underground, biomass, leads, to, similar, responses, of, these, carbon, pools, to, fluctuations, in, annual, precipitation, and, temperature, on, a, broad, spatial, scale, because, plant, productivity, is, limited, by, grassland, precipitation, carbon, stocks, are, highest, in, regions, where, precipitation, is, heaviest, such, as, the, high, grass, prairie, in, the, humid, temperate, region, of, the, united, states, similarly, as, annual, temperatures, rise, grassland, carbon, stocks, decrease, due, to, increased, evapotranspiration, grasslands, have, suffered, large, losses, of, organic, carbon, due, to, soil, disturbances, vegetation, degradation, fires, erosion, nutrient, deficiencies, and, water, shortages, the, type, frequency, and, intensity, of, the, disturbance, can, play, a, key, role, in, the, soil, organic, carbon, soc, balance, of, grasslands, bedrock, irrigation, practices, soil, acidification, liming, and, pasture, management, can, all, have, potential, impacts, on, grassland, organic, carbon, stocks, good, grassland, management, can, reverse, historical, soil, carbon, losses, the, relationship, of, improved, biodiversity, with, carbon, storage, is, subject, of, research, there, is, a, lack, of, agreement, on, the, amount, of, carbon, that, can, be, stored, in, grassland, ecosystem, this, is, partly, caused, by, different, methodologies, applied, to, measure, soil, organic, carbon, and, limited, respective, datasets, further, carbon, accumulation, in, soils, changes, significantly, over, time, and, point, in, time, measurements, produce, an, insufficient, evidence, base, grasslands, are, among, the, most, threatened, ecosystems, global, losses, from, grassland, degradation, are, estimated, to, be, over, 7, billion, per, year, according, to, the, international, union, for, the, conservation, of, nature, iucn, the, most, significant, threat, to, grasslands, is, human, land, use, especially, agriculture, and, mining, the, vulnerability, of, grasslands, stems, from, a, range, of, factors, such, as, misclassification, poor, protection, and, cultivation, grasslands, have, an, extensive, history, of, human, activity, and, disturbance, to, feed, a, growing, human, population, most, of, the, world, s, grasslands, are, converted, from, natural, landscapes, to, fields, of, corn, wheat, or, other, crops, grasslands, that, have, remained, largely, intact, thus, far, such, as, the, east, african, savannas, are, in, danger, of, being, lost, to, agriculture, grasslands, are, very, sensitive, to, disturbances, such, as, people, hunting, and, killing, key, species, or, plowing, the, land, to, make, more, space, for, farms, grassland, vegetation, is, often, a, plagioclimax, it, remains, dominant, in, a, particular, area, usually, due, to, grazing, cutting, or, natural, or, man, made, fires, all, discouraging, colonization, by, and, survival, of, tree, and, shrub, seedlings, some, of, the, world, s, largest, expanses, of, grassland, are, found, in, the, african, savanna, and, these, are, maintained, by, wild, herbivores, as, well, as, by, nomadic, pastoralists, and, their, cattle, sheep, or, goats, grasslands, have, an, impact, on, climate, change, by, slower, decomposition, rates, of, litter, compared, to, forest, environments, grasslands, may, occur, naturally, or, as, a, result, of, human, activity, hunting, cultures, around, the, world, often, set, regular, fires, to, maintain, and, extend, grasslands, and, prevent, fire, intolerant, trees, and, shrubs, from, taking, hold, the, tallgrass, prairies, in, the, u, s, midwest, may, have, been, extended, eastward, into, illinois, indiana, and, ohio, by, human, agency, much, grassland, in, northwest, europe, developed, after, the, neolithic, period, when, people, gradually, cleared, the, forest, to, create, areas, for, raising, their, livestock, grasslands, often, occur, in, areas, with, annual, precipitation, is, between, 600, mm, 24, in, and, 1, 500, mm, 59, in, and, average, mean, annual, temperatures, ranges, from, 5, and, 20, c, however, some, grasslands, occur, in, colder, 20, c, and, hotter, 30, c, climatic, conditions, grassland, can, exist, in, habitats, that, are, frequently, disturbed, by, grazing, or, fire, as, such, disturbance, prevents, the, encroachment, of, woody, species, species, richness, is, particularly, high, in, grasslands, of, low, soil, fertility, such, as, serpentine, barrens, and, calcareous, grasslands, where, woody, encroachment, is, prevented, as, low, nutrient, levels, in, the, soil, may, inhibit, the, growth, of, forest, and, shrub, species, another, common, predicament, often, experienced, by, the, ill, fated, grassland, creatures, is, the, constant, burning, of, plants, fueled, by, oxygen, and, many, expired, photosynthesizing, organisms, with, the, lack, of, rain, pushing, this, problem, to, further, heights, when, not, limited, by, other, factors, increasing, co, 2, concentration, in, the, air, increases, plant, growth, similarly, as, water, use, efficiency, which, is, very, important, in, drier, regions, however, the, advantages, of, elevated, co, 2, are, limited, by, factors, including, water, availability, and, available, nutrients, particularly, nitrogen, thus, effects, of, elevated, co, 2, on, plant, growth, will, vary, with, local, climate, patterns, species, adaptations, to, water, limitations, and, nitrogen, availability, studies, indicate, that, nutrient, depletion, may, happen, faster, in, drier, regions, and, with, factors, like, plant, community, composition, and, grazing, nitrogen, deposition, from, air, pollutants, and, increased, mineralization, from, higher, temperatures, can, increase, plant, productivity, but, increases, are, often, among, a, discount, in, biodiversity, as, faster, growing, plants, outcompete, others, a, study, of, a, california, grassland, found, that, global, change, may, speed, reductions, in, diversity, and, forb, species, are, most, prone, to, this, process, misguided, afforestation, efforts, for, example, as, part, of, the, global, effort, to, increase, carbon, sequestration, can, harm, grasslands, and, their, core, ecosystem, services, forest, centric, restoration, efforts, can, create, the, risk, of, misreading, and, misclassifying, of, landscapes, a, map, created, by, the, world, resources, institute, in, collaboration, with, the, iucn, identifies, 2, billion, hectares, for, potential, forest, restoration, it, is, criticised, for, including, 900, million, hectares, of, grasslands, it, is, expected, that, non, native, grasses, will, continue, to, outperform, native, species, under, warmer, and, drier, conditions, that, occur, in, many, grasslands, due, to, climate, change, the, type, of, land, management, used, in, grasslands, can, also, lead, to, grassland, loss, degradation, many, grasslands, and, other, open, ecosystems, depend, on, disturbances, such, as, wildfires, controlled, burns, and, or, grazing, to, persist, although, this, subject, is, still, controversial, a, study, in, brazilian, subtropical, highland, grasslands, found, that, grasslands, without, traditional, land, management, which, uses, fire, every, two, years, and, extensive, cattle, grazing, can, disappear, within, 30, years, this, study, showed, that, grasslands, inside, protected, areas, in, which, fire, is, not, allowed, and, cattle, grazing, is, banned, grasslands, were, quickly, replaced, by, shrubs, shrub, encroachment, land, cover, has, always, changed, during, the, years, the, following, relates, to, the, changes, between, 1960, and, 2015, there, has, been, a, decrease, in, semi, natural, grasslands, and, an, increase, in, areas, with, arable, land, forest, and, land, used, for, infrastructure, and, buildings, the, line, style, and, relative, thickness, of, the, lines, indicates, the, percentage, of, the, total, area, that, changed, changes, less, than, 1, and, land, cover, classes, with, all, changes, less, than, 1, i, e, semi, natural, wetlands, and, water, are, not, included, in, 1960, most, of, the, land, 49, 7, was, covered, with, forest, and, there, was, also, more, semi, natural, grassland, 18, 8, than, arable, land, 15, 8, in, 2015, this, has, changed, drastically, the, forest, cover, has, increased, 50, 8, and, arable, land, has, also, increased, 20, 4, but, the, semi, natural, grassland, cover, has, decreased, although, it, still, covers, a, large, area, of, the, earth, 10, 6, a, quarter, of, semi, natural, grassland, was, lost, through, intensification, i, e, it, was, converted, into, arable, or, pasture, land, and, forests, it, is, more, likely, that, intensification, will, occur, in, flat, semi, natural, grasslands, especially, if, the, soil, is, fertile, on, the, other, hand, grasslands, where, the, land, is, drought, prone, or, less, productive, are, more, likely, to, persist, as, semi, natural, grasslands, than, grasslands, with, fertile, soil, and, low, gradient, of, the, terrain, furthermore, the, accessibility, of, the, land, is, also, important, as, it, is, then, easier, to, fertilize, for, example, for, instance, if, it, is, located, near, a, road, with, the, development, of, technology, it, is, becoming, increasingly, easy, to, cultivate, land, with, a, steeper, gradient, to, the, detriment, of, grasslands, the, management, of, grasslands, is, also, changing, permanently, there, is, increased, use, of, mineral, fertilizers, furthermore, borders, and, field, edges, are, removed, to, enlarge, fields, and, leveling, the, terrain, to, facilitate, the, use, of, agricultural, machinery, the, professional, study, of, dry, grasslands, falls, under, the, category, of, rangeland, management, which, focuses, on, ecosystem, services, associated, with, the, grass, dominated, arid, and, semi, arid, rangelands, of, the, world, rangelands, account, for, an, estimated, 70, of, the, earth, s, landmass, thus, many, cultures, including, those, of, the, united, states, are, indebted, to, the, economics, that, the, world, s, grasslands, have, to, offer, from, producing, grazing, animals, tourism, ecosystems, services, such, as, clean, water, and, air, and, energy, extraction, vast, areas, of, grassland, are, affected, by, woody, encroachment, which, is, the, expansion, of, woody, plants, at, the, expense, of, the, herbaceous, layer, woody, encroachment, is, caused, by, a, combination, of, human, impact, e, g, fire, exclusion, overstocking, and, resulting, overgrazing, and, environmental, factors, i, e, increased, co, 2, levels, in, the, atmosphere, it, can, have, severe, negative, consequences, on, key, ecosystem, services, like, land, productivity, and, groundwater, recharge, despite, growing, recognition, of, the, importance, of, grasslands, understanding, of, restoration, options, remains, limited, cost, of, grassland, restoration, is, highly, variable, and, respective, data, is, scarce, successful, grassland, restoration, has, several, dimensions, including, recognition, in, policy, standardisation, of, indicators, of, degradation, scientific, innovation, knowledge, transfer, and, data, sharing, restoration, methods, and, measures, include, the, following, for, the, period, 2021, 2030, the, united, nations, general, assembly, has, proclaimed, the, un, decade, on, restoration, involving, a, joint, resolution, by, over, 70, countries, it, is, led, by, the, united, nations, environment, programme, and, the, food, and, agriculture, organization, grassland, types, by, schimper, 1898, 1903, grassland, types, by, ellenberg, and, mueller, dombois, 1967, formation, class, v, terrestrial, herbaceous, communities, grassland, types, by, laycock, 1979, these, grasslands, can, be, classified, as, the, tropical, and, subtropical, grasslands, savannas, and, shrublands, biome, the, rainfall, level, for, that, grassland, type, is, between, 90, and, 150, centimeters, per, year, grasses, and, scattered, trees, are, common, for, that, ecoregion, as, well, as, large, mammals, such, as, wildebeest, connochaetes, taurinus, and, zebra, equus, zebra, notable, tropical, and, subtropical, grasslands, include, the, llanos, grasslands, of, south, america, mid, latitude, grasslands, including, the, prairie, and, pacific, grasslands, of, north, america, the, pampas, of, argentina, brazil, and, uruguay, calcareous, downland, and, the, steppes, of, europe, they, are, classified, with, temperate, savannas, and, shrublands, as, the, temperate, grasslands, savannas, and, shrublands, biome, temperate, grasslands, are, the, home, to, many, large, herbivores, such, as, bison, gazelles, zebras, rhinoceroses, and, wild, horses, carnivores, like, lions, wolves, cheetahs, and, leopards, are, also, found, in, temperate, grasslands, other, animals, of, this, region, include, deer, prairie, dogs, mice, jack, rabbits, skunks, coyotes, snakes, foxes, owls, badgers, blackbirds, grasshoppers, meadowlarks, sparrows, quails, hawks, and, hyenas, grasslands, that, are, flooded, seasonally, or, year, round, like, the, everglades, of, florida, the, pantanal, of, brazil, bolivia, and, paraguay, or, the, esteros, del, ibera, in, argentina, are, classified, with, flooded, savannas, as, the, flooded, grasslands, and, savannas, biome, and, occur, mostly, in, the, tropics, and, subtropics, the, species, that, live, in, these, grasslands, are, well, adapted, to, the, hydrologic, regimes, and, soil, conditions, the, everglades, the, world, s, largest, rain, fed, flooded, grassland, is, rich, in, 11, 000, species, of, seed, bearing, plants, 25, species, of, orchids, 300, bird, species, and, 150, fish, species, water, meadows, are, grasslands, that, are, deliberately, flooded, for, short, periods, high, altitude, grasslands, located, on, high, mountain, ranges, around, the, world, like, the, p, ramo, of, the, andes, mountains, they, are, part, of, the, montane, grasslands, and, shrublands, biome, and, can, be, tropical, subtropical, and, temperate, the, plants, and, animals, that, can, be, found, in, the, tropical, montane, are, able, to, adapt, to, cool, wet, conditions, as, well, as, intense, sunlight, similar, to, montane, grasslands, polar, arctic, tundra, can, have, grasses, but, high, soil, moisture, means, that, few, tundras, are, grass, dominated, today, however, during, the, pleistocene, glacial, periods, commonly, referred, to, as, ice, ages, a, grassland, known, as, steppe, tundra, or, mammoth, steppe, occupied, large, areas, of, the, northern, hemisphere, these, areas, were, very, cold, and, arid, and, featured, sub, surface, permafrost, hence, tundra, but, were, nevertheless, productive, grassland, ecosystems, supporting, a, wide, variety, of, fauna, as, the, temperature, increased, and, the, climate, became, wetter, at, the, beginning, of, the, holocene, much, of, the, mammoth, steppe, transitioned, to, forest, while, the, drier, parts, in, central, eurasia, remained, as, a, grassland, becoming, the, modern, eurasian, steppe, also, called, desert, grasslands, they, are, composed, of, sparse, grassland, ecoregions, located, in, the, deserts, and, xeric, shrublands, biome, temperature, extremes, and, low, amount, of, rainfall, characterise, these, kinds, of, grasslands, therefore, plants, and, animals, are, well, adapted, to, minimize, water, loss, the, grassland, ecoregions, of, the, temperate, grasslands, savannas, and, shrublands, biome, are
