the, french, colonial, empire, french, empire, colonial, fran, ais, comprised, the, overseas, colonies, protectorates, and, mandate, territories, that, came, under, french, rule, from, the, 16th, century, onward, a, distinction, is, generally, made, between, the, first, french, colonial, empire, that, existed, until, 1814, by, which, time, most, of, it, had, been, lost, or, sold, and, the, second, french, colonial, empire, which, began, with, the, conquest, of, algiers, in, 1830, on, the, eve, of, world, war, i, france, s, colonial, empire, was, the, second, largest, in, the, world, after, the, british, empire, france, began, to, establish, colonies, in, the, americas, the, caribbean, and, india, in, the, 16th, century, but, lost, most, of, its, possessions, following, its, defeat, in, the, seven, years, war, the, north, american, possessions, were, lost, to, britain, and, spain, but, spain, later, returned, louisiana, to, france, in, 1800, the, territory, was, then, sold, to, the, united, states, in, 1803, france, rebuilt, a, new, empire, mostly, after, 1850, concentrating, chiefly, in, africa, as, well, as, indochina, and, the, south, pacific, as, it, developed, the, new, french, empire, took, on, roles, of, trade, with, the, metropole, supplying, raw, materials, and, purchasing, manufactured, items, especially, after, the, disastrous, franco, prussian, war, which, saw, germany, become, the, leading, economic, and, military, power, of, continental, europe, acquiring, colonies, and, rebuilding, an, empire, was, seen, as, a, way, to, restore, french, prestige, in, the, world, it, was, also, to, provide, manpower, during, the, world, wars, a, major, goal, was, the, mission, civilisatrice, or, civilizing, mission, in, 1884, the, leading, proponent, of, colonialism, jules, ferry, declared, the, higher, races, have, a, right, over, the, lower, races, they, have, a, duty, to, civilize, the, inferior, races, full, citizenship, rights, assimilation, were, offered, although, in, reality, assimilation, was, always, receding, the, colonial, populations, treated, like, subjects, not, citizens, france, sent, small, numbers, of, settlers, to, its, empire, with, the, notable, exception, of, algeria, where, the, french, settlers, took, power, while, being, a, minority, in, world, war, ii, charles, de, gaulle, and, the, free, french, took, control, of, the, overseas, colonies, one, by, one, and, used, them, as, bases, from, which, they, prepared, to, liberate, france, historian, tony, chafer, argues, in, an, effort, to, restore, its, world, power, status, after, the, humiliation, of, defeat, and, occupation, france, was, eager, to, maintain, its, overseas, empire, at, the, end, of, the, second, world, war, however, after, 1945, anti, colonial, movements, began, to, challenge, european, authority, major, revolts, in, indochina, and, algeria, proved, very, expensive, and, france, lost, both, colonies, after, these, conflicts, a, relatively, peaceful, decolonization, took, place, elsewhere, after, 1960, the, french, constitution, of, 27, october, 1946, fourth, french, republic, established, the, french, union, which, endured, until, 1958, newer, remnants, of, the, colonial, empire, were, integrated, into, france, as, overseas, departments, and, territories, within, the, french, republic, these, now, total, altogether, 119, 394, km, 2, 46, 098, sq, miles, with, 2, 8, million, people, in, 2021, links, between, france, and, its, former, colonies, persist, through, la, francophonie, the, cfa, franc, and, joint, military, operations, such, as, operation, serval, during, the, 16th, century, the, french, colonization, of, the, americas, began, excursions, of, giovanni, da, verrazzano, and, jacques, cartier, in, the, early, 16th, century, as, well, as, the, frequent, voyages, of, french, boats, and, fishermen, to, the, grand, banks, off, newfoundland, throughout, that, century, were, the, precursors, to, the, story, of, france, s, colonial, expansion, but, spain, s, defense, of, its, american, monopoly, and, the, further, distractions, caused, in, france, itself, in, the, later, 16th, century, by, the, french, wars, of, religion, prevented, any, constant, efforts, by, france, to, settle, colonies, early, french, attempts, to, found, colonies, in, brazil, in, 1555, at, rio, de, janeiro, france, antarctique, and, in, florida, including, fort, caroline, in, 1562, and, in, 1612, at, s, o, lu, s, france, quinoxiale, were, not, successful, due, to, a, lack, of, official, interest, and, to, portuguese, and, spanish, vigilance, the, story, of, france, s, colonial, empire, truly, began, on, 27, july, 1605, with, the, foundation, of, port, royal, in, the, colony, of, acadia, in, north, america, in, what, is, now, nova, scotia, canada, a, few, years, later, in, 1608, samuel, de, champlain, founded, quebec, which, was, to, become, the, capital, of, the, enormous, but, sparsely, settled, fur, trading, colony, of, new, france, also, called, canada, new, france, had, a, rather, small, population, which, resulted, from, more, emphasis, being, placed, on, the, fur, trade, rather, than, agricultural, settlements, due, to, this, emphasis, the, french, relied, heavily, on, creating, friendly, contacts, with, the, local, first, nations, community, without, the, appetite, of, new, england, for, land, and, by, relying, solely, on, aboriginals, to, supply, them, with, fur, at, the, trading, posts, the, french, composed, a, complex, series, of, military, commercial, and, diplomatic, connections, these, became, the, most, enduring, alliances, between, the, french, and, the, first, nation, community, the, french, were, however, under, pressure, from, religious, orders, to, convert, them, to, catholicism, through, alliances, with, various, native, american, tribes, the, french, were, able, to, exert, a, loose, control, over, much, of, the, north, american, continent, areas, of, french, settlement, were, generally, limited, to, the, st, lawrence, river, valley, prior, to, the, establishment, of, the, 1663, sovereign, council, the, territories, of, new, france, were, developed, as, mercantile, colonies, it, is, only, after, the, arrival, of, intendant, jean, talon, in, 1665, that, france, gave, its, american, colonies, the, proper, means, to, develop, population, colonies, comparable, to, that, of, the, british, acadia, itself, was, lost, to, the, british, in, the, treaty, of, utrecht, in, 1713, back, in, france, there, was, relatively, little, interest, in, colonialism, which, concentrated, rather, on, dominance, within, europe, and, for, most, of, its, history, new, france, was, far, behind, the, british, north, american, colonies, in, both, population, and, economic, development, in, 1699, french, territorial, claims, in, north, america, expanded, still, further, with, the, foundation, of, louisiana, in, the, basin, of, the, mississippi, river, the, extensive, trading, network, throughout, the, region, connected, to, canada, through, the, great, lakes, was, maintained, through, a, vast, system, of, fortifications, many, of, them, centred, in, the, illinois, country, and, in, present, day, arkansas, as, the, french, empire, in, north, america, grew, the, french, also, began, to, build, a, smaller, but, more, profitable, empire, in, the, west, indies, settlement, along, the, south, american, coast, in, what, is, today, french, guiana, began, in, 1624, and, a, colony, was, founded, on, saint, kitts, in, 1625, the, island, had, to, be, shared, with, the, english, until, the, treaty, of, utrecht, in, 1713, when, it, was, ceded, outright, the, current, isle, of, the, commonwealth, of, dominica, in, the, eastern, caribbean, also, fell, under, increasing, french, settlement, from, the, early, 1630s, the, compagnie, des, les, de, l, am, rique, founded, colonies, in, guadeloupe, and, martinique, in, 1635, and, a, colony, was, later, founded, on, saint, lucia, by, 1650, the, food, producing, plantations, of, these, colonies, were, built, and, sustained, through, slavery, with, the, supply, of, slaves, dependent, on, the, african, slave, trade, local, resistance, by, the, indigenous, peoples, resulted, in, the, carib, expulsion, of, 1660, france, s, most, important, caribbean, colonial, possession, was, established, in, 1664, when, the, colony, of, saint, domingue, today, s, haiti, was, founded, on, the, western, half, of, the, spanish, island, of, hispaniola, in, the, 18th, century, saint, domingue, grew, to, be, the, richest, sugar, colony, in, the, caribbean, the, eastern, half, of, hispaniola, today, s, dominican, republic, also, came, under, french, rule, for, a, short, period, after, being, given, to, france, by, spain, in, 1795, with, the, end, of, the, french, wars, of, religion, king, henry, iv, encouraged, various, enterprises, to, establish, trade, with, the, african, and, asian, continents, in, december, 1600, a, company, was, formed, through, the, association, of, saint, malo, laval, and, vitr, to, trade, with, the, moluccas, and, japan, two, ships, the, croissant, and, the, corbin, were, sent, around, the, cape, of, good, hope, in, may, 1601, one, was, wrecked, in, the, maldives, leading, to, the, adventure, of, fran, ois, pyrard, de, laval, who, managed, to, return, to, france, in, 1611, the, second, ship, carrying, fran, ois, martin, de, vitr, reached, ceylon, and, traded, with, aceh, in, sumatra, but, was, captured, by, the, dutch, on, the, return, leg, at, cape, finisterre, fran, ois, martin, de, vitr, was, the, first, frenchman, to, write, an, account, of, travels, to, the, far, east, in, 1604, at, the, request, of, henry, iv, and, from, that, time, numerous, accounts, on, asia, would, be, published, from, 1604, to, 1609, following, the, return, of, fran, ois, martin, de, vitr, henry, developed, a, strong, enthusiasm, for, travel, to, asia, and, attempted, to, set, up, a, french, east, india, company, on, the, model, of, england, and, the, netherlands, on, 1, june, 1604, he, issued, letters, patent, to, dieppe, merchants, to, form, the, dieppe, company, giving, them, exclusive, rights, to, asian, trade, for, 15, years, no, ships, were, sent, however, until, 1616, in, 1609, another, adventurer, pierre, olivier, malherbe, returned, from, a, circumnavigation, of, the, globe, and, informed, henry, of, his, adventures, he, had, visited, china, and, india, and, had, an, encounter, with, akbar, colonies, were, established, in, india, s, chandernagore, 1673, and, pondich, ry, in, the, south, east, 1674, and, later, at, yanam, 1723, mahe, 1725, and, karikal, 1739, see, french, india, in, 1664, the, french, east, india, company, was, established, to, compete, for, trade, in, the, east, although, initial, french, colonization, primarily, occurred, in, the, americas, and, in, asia, the, french, did, establish, a, few, colonies, and, trading, posts, on, the, african, continent, initial, french, colonization, in, africa, began, in, modern, day, senegal, madagascar, and, along, the, mascarene, islands, initial, french, colonial, projects, partially, administered, by, the, french, east, india, company, prioritized, plantation, economies, and, slave, labor, these, economies, were, based, on, monoculture, agriculture, and, forced, african, labor, poor, living, conditions, famines, and, disease, made, enslaved, labor, conditions, particularly, lethal, across, french, colonies, french, presence, in, senegal, began, in, 1626, although, formal, colonies, and, trading, posts, were, not, established, until, 1659, with, the, founding, of, saint, louis, and, 1677, with, the, founding, of, gor, e, additionally, the, first, settlement, of, madagascar, began, in, 1642, with, the, establishment, of, fort, dauphin, initial, french, colonial, expansion, in, senegal, and, madagascar, was, primarily, motivated, by, desires, to, secure, access, to, natural, resources, including, gum, arabic, groundnuts, or, peanuts, and, other, raw, materials, in, addition, they, were, further, motivated, by, desires, throughout, the, 17th, and, 19th, century, to, secure, access, to, and, to, control, the, slave, trade, through, an, emphasis, on, controlling, seaports, the, french, sought, to, forcibly, extract, enslaved, people, to, send, them, abroad, for, profit, colonial, development, prioritized, export, oriented, production, while, local, industry, remained, very, underdeveloped, there, was, high, development, of, production, for, export, oriented, production, notably, of, ground, nuts, in, senegal, in, additional, coastal, areas, the, french, set, up, slave, plantations, initial, french, development, prioritized, the, building, of, roads, to, connect, natural, resources, to, harbors, and, ports, additional, initial, french, settlements, were, established, on, the, mascarene, islands, which, include, reunion, island, mauritius, and, rodrigues, reunion, island, was, first, settled, in, 1642, and, was, administered, by, the, french, east, india, company, starting, in, 1665, after, initial, settlement, by, the, netherlands, france, took, control, of, mauritius, which, it, renamed, the, island, of, france, in, 1721, furthermore, france, took, control, of, rodrigues, in, 1735, and, seychelles, in, 1756, on, reunion, island, bourbon, island, the, french, east, india, company, first, introduced, the, slave, trade, in, the, 1730s, the, french, east, india, company, additionally, introduced, coffee, and, sought, to, create, a, plantation, economy, centered, around, forced, labor, characteristic, of, plantation, colonies, the, french, colonists, were, a, minority, on, reunion, island, in, 1763, there, were, only, 4, 000, french, colonists, while, there, were, over, 18, 000, african, enslaved, people, the, majority, of, enslaved, people, on, reunion, island, worked, on, coffee, plantations, they, primarily, came, from, madagascar, mozambique, and, senegal, the, economy, of, the, mauritius, island, of, france, was, similarly, based, on, an, exploitative, plantation, system, dependent, on, forced, african, labor, the, monoculture, plantations, farmed, sugar, cane, cotton, indigo, rice, and, wheat, around, 2, 000, colonists, and,

because, of, poor, living, conditions, and, famines, after, a, series, of, crop, failures, from, 1725, to, 1737, as, much, as, 10, of, the, islands, enslaved, populations, died, due, to, famine, and, disease, in, the, middle, of, the, 18th, century, a, series, of, colonial, conflicts, began, between, france, and, britain, which, ultimately, resulted, in, the, destruction, of, most, of, the, first, french, colonial, empire, and, the, near, complete, expulsion, of, france, from, the, americas, these, wars, were, the, war, of, the, austrian, succession, 1740, 1748, the, seven, years, war, 1756, 1763, the, american, revolution, 1775, 1783, the, french, revolutionary, wars, 1793, 1802, and, the, napoleonic, wars, 1803, 1815, it, may, even, be, seen, further, back, in, time, to, the, first, of, the, french, and, indian, wars, this, cyclic, conflict, is, sometimes, known, as, the, second, hundred, years, war, although, the, war, of, the, austrian, succession, was, indecisive, despite, french, successes, in, india, under, the, french, governor, general, joseph, fran, ois, dupleix, and, europe, under, marshal, saxe, the, seven, years, war, after, early, french, successes, in, menorca, and, north, america, saw, a, french, defeat, with, the, numerically, superior, british, over, one, million, to, about, 50, thousand, french, settlers, conquering, not, only, new, france, excluding, the, small, islands, of, saint, pierre, and, miquelon, but, also, most, of, france, s, west, indian, caribbean, colonies, and, all, of, the, french, indian, outposts, while, the, peace, treaty, saw, france, s, indian, outposts, and, the, caribbean, islands, of, martinique, and, guadeloupe, restored, to, france, the, competition, for, influence, in, india, had, been, won, by, the, british, and, north, america, was, entirely, lost, most, of, new, france, was, taken, by, britain, also, referred, to, as, british, north, america, except, louisiana, which, france, ceded, to, spain, as, payment, for, spain, s, late, entrance, into, the, war, and, as, compensation, for, britain, s, annexation, of, spanish, florida, also, ceded, to, the, british, were, grenada, and, saint, lucia, in, the, west, indies, although, the, loss, of, canada, would, cause, much, regret, in, future, generations, it, excited, little, unhappiness, at, the, time, colonialism, was, widely, regarded, as, both, unimportant, to, france, and, immoral, some, recovery, of, the, french, colonial, empire, was, made, during, the, french, intervention, in, the, american, revolution, with, saint, lucia, being, returned, to, france, by, the, treaty, of, paris, in, 1783, but, not, nearly, as, much, as, had, been, hoped, for, at, the, time, of, french, intervention, true, disaster, came, to, what, remained, of, france, s, colonial, empire, in, 1791, when, saint, domingue, the, western, third, of, the, caribbean, island, of, hispaniola, france, s, richest, and, most, important, colony, was, riven, by, a, massive, slave, revolt, caused, partly, by, the, divisions, among, the, island, s, elite, which, had, resulted, from, the, french, revolution, of, 1789, the, slaves, led, eventually, by, toussaint, l, ouverture, and, then, following, his, capture, by, the, french, in, 1801, by, jean, jacques, dessalines, held, their, own, against, french, and, british, opponents, the, french, launched, a, failed, expedition, in, 1802, and, were, up, against, a, crippling, royal, naval, blockade, the, following, year, as, a, result, the, empire, of, haiti, ultimately, achieved, independence, in, 1804, becoming, the, first, black, republic, in, the, world, followed, by, liberia, in, 1847, the, black, and, mulatto, population, of, the, island, including, the, spanish, east, had, declined, from, 700, 000, in, 1789, to, 351, 819, in, 1804, about, 80, 000, haitians, died, in, the, 1802, 03, campaign, alone, of, the, 55, 131, french, soldiers, dispatched, to, haiti, in, 1802, 03, 45, 000, including, 18, generals, died, along, with, 10, 000, sailors, the, great, majority, from, disease, captain, sorrell, of, the, british, navy, observed, france, lost, there, one, of, the, finest, armies, she, ever, sent, forth, composed, of, picked, veterans, the, conquerors, of, italy, and, of, german, legions, she, is, now, entirely, deprived, of, her, influence, and, her, power, in, the, west, indies, meanwhile, france, s, newly, resumed, war, with, britain, resulted, in, the, british, capture, of, practically, all, remaining, french, colonies, these, were, restored, at, the, treaty, of, amiens, in, 1802, but, when, war, resumed, in, 1803, the, british, soon, recaptured, them, france, s, 1800, recovery, of, louisiana, from, spain, in, the, secret, third, treaty, of, san, ildefonso, came, to, nothing, as, the, success, of, the, haitian, revolution, convinced, napoleon, that, holding, louisiana, would, not, be, worth, the, cost, leading, to, its, sale, to, the, united, states, in, 1803, the, french, attempt, to, establish, a, colony, in, egypt, in, 1798, 1801, was, not, successful, battle, casualties, for, the, campaign, were, at, least, 15, 000, killed, or, wounded, and, 8, 500, prisoners, for, france, 50, 000, killed, or, wounded, and, 15, 000, prisoners, for, turkey, egypt, other, ottoman, lands, and, britain, at, the, close, of, the, napoleonic, wars, most, of, france, s, colonies, were, restored, to, it, by, britain, notably, guadeloupe, and, martinique, in, the, west, indies, french, guiana, on, the, coast, of, south, america, various, trading, posts, in, senegal, the, le, bourbon, r, union, in, the, indian, ocean, and, france, s, tiny, indian, possessions, however, britain, finally, annexed, saint, lucia, tobago, the, seychelles, and, the, isle, de, france, now, mauritius, in, 1825, charles, x, sent, an, expedition, to, ha, ti, resulting, in, the, haiti, indemnity, controversy, the, beginnings, of, the, second, french, colonial, empire, were, laid, in, 1830, with, the, french, invasion, of, algeria, which, was, fully, conquered, by, 1903, historian, ben, kiernan, estimates, that, 825, 000, algerians, died, during, the, conquest, by, 1875, the, french, colonial, empire, established, a, protectorate, in, morocco, between, the, years, of, 1912, to, 1956, france, s, general, approach, to, governing, the, protectorate, of, morocco, was, a, policy, of, in, direct, rule, where, they, co, opted, existing, governance, systems, to, control, the, protectorate, specifically, the, moroccan, elite, and, sultan, were, both, left, in, control, while, being, strongly, influenced, by, the, french, government, french, colonialism, in, morocco, was, discriminatory, against, native, moroccans, and, highly, detrimental, to, the, moroccan, economy, moroccans, were, treated, as, second, class, citizens, and, discriminated, against, in, all, aspects, of, colonial, life, infrastructure, was, discriminatory, in, colonial, morocco, the, french, colonial, government, built, 36, 5, kilometers, of, sewers, in, the, new, neighborhoods, created, to, accommodate, new, french, settlers, while, only, 4, 3, kilometers, of, sewers, were, built, in, indigenous, moroccan, communities, additionally, land, in, morocco, was, far, more, expensive, for, moroccans, than, for, french, settlers, for, example, while, the, average, moroccan, had, a, plot, of, land, 50, times, smaller, than, their, french, settler, counterparts, moroccans, were, forced, to, pay, 24, more, per, hectare, moroccans, were, additionally, prohibited, from, buying, land, from, french, settlers, colonial, morocco, s, economy, was, designed, to, benefit, french, businesses, at, the, detriment, of, moroccan, laborers, morocco, was, forced, to, import, all, of, its, goods, from, france, despite, higher, costs, additionally, improvements, to, agriculture, and, irrigation, systems, in, morocco, exclusively, benefited, colonial, agriculturalists, while, leaving, moroccan, farms, at, a, technological, disadvantage, between, the, years, of, 1914, to, 1921, the, zaian, confederation, of, berber, tribes, primarily, from, the, atlas, mountain, region, of, morocco, staged, an, armed, resistance, against, french, colonial, control, the, outbreak, of, world, war, one, prevented, the, french, from, committing, fully, to, the, conflict, and, thus, the, french, forces, suffered, high, losses, for, example, at, the, battle, of, el, herri, in, 1914, 600, french, soldiers, were, killed, the, fighting, was, primarily, characterized, by, guerrilla, warfare, the, zaian, forces, additionally, received, military, and, economic, support, from, the, central, powers, the, berber, independence, leader, abd, el, krim, 1882, 1963, organized, armed, resistance, against, the, spanish, and, french, for, control, of, morocco, the, spanish, had, faced, unrest, off, and, on, from, the, 1890s, but, in, 1921, spanish, forces, were, massacred, at, the, battle, of, annual, el, krim, founded, an, independent, rif, republic, that, operated, until, 1926, but, had, no, international, recognition, paris, and, madrid, agreed, to, collaborate, to, destroy, it, they, sent, in, 200, 000, soldiers, forcing, el, krim, to, surrender, in, 1926, he, was, exiled, in, the, pacific, until, 1947, morocco, became, quiet, and, in, 1936, became, the, base, from, which, francisco, franco, launched, his, revolt, against, madrid, the, french, protectorate, of, tunisia, lasted, from, 1881, to, 1956, the, protectorate, was, initially, established, after, the, successful, invasion, of, tunisia, in, 1881, the, groundwork, for, occupation, was, laid, on, april, 24, 1881, when, the, french, deployed, 35, 000, troops, from, algeria, to, invade, several, tunisian, cities, as, in, morocco, the, french, governed, indirectly, and, preserved, the, existing, government, structure, the, bey, remained, an, absolute, monarch, tunisian, ministers, were, still, appointed,

military, government, much, to, the, annoyance, of, the, colonists, by, 1857, the, army, had, conquered, kabyle, province, and, pacified, the, country, by, 1860, the, european, population, had, grown, to, 200, 000, and, lands, of, native, algerians, were, being, rapidly, bought, and, farmed, by, the, new, arrivals, in, the, first, eight, years, of, his, rule, napoleon, iii, paid, little, attention, to, algeria, in, september, 1860, however, he, and, empress, eug, nie, visited, algeria, and, the, trip, made, a, deep, impression, upon, them, eug, nie, was, invited, to, attend, a, traditional, arab, wedding, and, the, emperor, met, many, of, the, local, leaders, the, emperor, gradually, conceived, the, idea, that, algeria, should, be, governed, differently, from, other, colonies, in, february, 1863, he, wrote, a, public, letter, to, pelissier, the, military, governor, saying, algeria, is, not, a, colony, in, the, traditional, sense, but, an, arab, kingdom, the, local, people, have, like, the, colonists, a, legal, right, to, my, protection, i, am, just, as, much, the, emperor, of, the, arabs, of, algeria, as, i, am, of, the, french, he, intended, to, rule, algeria, through, a, government, of, arab, aristocrats, toward, this, end, he, invited, the, chiefs, of, main, algerian, tribal, groups, to, his, chateau, at, compiegne, for, hunting, and, festivities, compared, to, previous, administrations, napoleon, iii, was, far, more, sympathetic, to, the, native, algerians, he, halted, european, migration, inland, restricting, them, to, the, coastal, zone, he, also, freed, the, algerian, rebel, leader, abd, al, qadir, who, had, been, promised, freedom, on, surrender, but, was, imprisoned, by, the, previous, administration, and, gave, him, a, stipend, of, 150, 000, francs, he, allowed, muslims, to, serve, in, the, military, and, civil, service, on, theoretically, equal, terms, and, allowed, them, to, migrate, to, france, in, addition, he, gave, the, option, of, citizenship, however, for, muslims, to, take, this, option, they, had, to, accept, all, of, the, french, civil, code, including, parts, governing, inheritance, and, marriage, which, conflicted, with, muslim, laws, and, they, had, to, reject, the, competence, of, religious, sharia, courts, this, was, interpreted, by, some, muslims, as, requiring, them, to, give, up, parts, of, their, religion, to, obtain, citizenship, and, was, resented, more, importantly, napoleon, iii, changed, the, system, of, land, tenure, while, ostensibly, well, intentioned, in, effect, this, move, destroyed, the, traditional, system, of, land, management, and, deprived, many, algerians, of, land, while, napoleon, did, renounce, state, claims, to, tribal, lands, he, also, began, a, process, of, dismantling, tribal, land, ownership, in, favour, of, individual, land, ownership, this, process, was, corrupted, by, french, officials, sympathetic, to, the, french, in, algeria, who, took, much, of, the, land, they, surveyed, into, public, domain, in, addition, many, tribal, leaders, chosen, for, loyalty, to, the, french, rather, than, influence, in, their, tribe, immediately, sold, communal, land, for, cash, his, attempted, reforms, were, interrupted, in, 1864, by, an, arab, insurrection, which, required, more, than, a, year, and, an, army, of, 85, 000, soldiers, to, suppress, nonetheless, he, did, not, give, up, his, idea, of, making, algeria, a, model, where, french, colonists, and, arabs, could, live, and, work, together, as, equals, he, traveled, to, algiers, for, a, second, time, on, 3, may, 1865, and, this, time, he, remained, for, a, month, meeting, with, tribal, leaders, and, local, officials, he, offered, a, wide, amnesty, to, participants, of, the, insurrection, and, promised, to, name, arabs, to, high, positions, in, his, government, he, also, promised, a, large, public, works, program, of, new, ports, railroads, and, roads, however, once, again, his, plans, met, a, major, natural, obstacle, in, 1866, and, 1868, algeria, was, struck, by, an, epidemic, of, cholera, clouds, of, locusts, drought, and, famine, and, his, reforms, were, hindered, by, the, french, colonists, who, voted, massively, against, him, in, the, plebiscites, of, his, late, reign, up, to, 500, 000, people, died, from, the, famine, and, epidemics, in, 1871, in, response, to, prolonged, famine, and, the, french, authorities, discriminatory, treatment, of, algerians, the, mokrani, revolt, in, the, kabylia, erupted, which, spread, through, much, of, algeria, by, april, 1871, 250, tribes, were, rebelling, the, uprising, was, defeated, in, 1872, there, were, roughly, 130, 000, colonists, in, algeria, in, 1871, and, by, 1900, there, were, one, million, in, 1902, a, french, military, expedition, entered, hoggar, mountains, and, defeated, the, kingdom, of, kel, ahaggar, the, conquest, of, algeria, was, fully, completed, in, 1903, with, the, french, in, control, of, all, saharan, lands, in, algeria, france, also, extended, its, influence, in, north, africa, after, 1870, establishing, a, protectorate, in, tunisia, in, 1881, with, the, bardo, treaty, gradually, french, control, crystallised, over, much, of, north, west, and, central, africa, by, around, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, including, the, modern, states, of, mauritania, senegal, guinea, mali, ivory, coast,

territory, of, chad, september, 1900, the, voulet, chanoine, mission, had, accomplished, all, its, goals, the, ruthlessness, of, the, mission, provoked, a, scandal, in, paris, as, a, part, of, the, scramble, for, africa, france, aimed, to, establish, a, continuous, west, east, axis, across, the, continent, in, contrast, with, the, proposed, british, north, south, axis, tensions, between, britain, and, france, heightened, in, africa, at, several, points, war, seemed, possible, but, no, outbreak, occurred, the, most, serious, episode, was, the, fashoda, incident, of, 1898, french, troops, tried, to, claim, an, area, in, the, southern, sudan, and, a, british, force, purporting, to, act, in, the, interests, of, the, khedive, of, egypt, arrived, to, confront, them, under, heavy, pressure, the, french, withdrew, implicitly, acknowledging, anglo, egyptian, control, over, the, area, an, agreement, between, the, two, states, recognised, the, status, quo, the, british, were, to, maintain, control, over, egypt, while, france, remained, the, dominant, power, in, morocco, still, it, is, commonly, believed, that, france, suffered, a, humiliating, defeat, overall, during, the, agadir, crisis, in, 1911, britain, supported, france, against, germany, and, morocco, became, a, french, protectorate, the, french, made, their, last, major, colonial, gains, after, world, war, i, when, they, gained, mandates, over, the, former, territories, of, the, ottoman, empire, that, make, up, what, is, now, syria, and, lebanon, as, well, as, most, of, the, former, german, colonies, of,

1847, queen, p, mare, iv, returned, from, her, self, imposed, exile, and, acquiesced, to, rule, under, the, protectorate, although, victorious, the, french, were, not, able, to, annex, the, islands, due, to, diplomatic, pressure, from, great, britain, so, tahiti, and, its, dependency, moorea, continued, to, be, ruled, under, the, protectorate, a, clause, to, the, war, settlement, known, as, the, jarnac, convention, or, the, anglo, french, convention, of, 1847, was, signed, by, france, and, great, britain, in, which, the, two, powers, agreed, to, respect, the, independence, of, queen, p, mare,

of, other, pacific, islands, formed, french, polynesia, at, this, time, the, french, also, established, colonies, in, the, south, pacific, including, new, caledonia, the, various, island, groups,

french, presence, in, indochina, an, important, factor, in, his, decision, was, the, belief, that, france, risked, becoming, a, second, rate, power, by, not, expanding, its, influence, in, east, asia, deeper, down, was, the, sense, that, france, owed, the, world, a, civilizing, mission, french, missionaries, had, been, active, in, vietnam, since, the, 17th, century, when, the, jesuit, priest, alexandre, de, rhodes, opened, a, mission, there, in, 1858, the, vietnamese, emperor, of, the, nguyen, dynasty, felt, threatened, by, the, french, influence, and, tried, to, expel, the, missionaries,

1861, 65, on, the, side, of, the, south, the, british, also, felt, threatened, by, the, construction, of, the, suez, canal, 1859, 1869, by, ferdinand, de, lesseps, in, egypt, they, tried, to, oppose, its, completion, by, diplomatic, pressures, and, by, promoting, revolts, among, workers, the, suez, canal, was, successfully, built, by, a, french, backed, company, which, was, to, remain, under, french, control, even, after, the, british, government, acquired, almost, half, of, the, shares, both, nations, saw, it, as, vital, to, maintaining, their, influence, and, respective, empire, in, east, africa, and, asia, in, 1882, ongoing, civil, disturbances, in, egypt, prompted, britain, to, intervene, extending, a, hand, to, france, france, s, leading, expansionist, jules, ferry, was, out, of, office, and, paris, allowed, london, to, take, effective, control, of, egypt, after, the, downfall, of, napoleon, iii, few, writers, used, the, word, empire, which, had, become, associated, with, despotism, decadence, and, weakness, preferring, the, word, colonies, however, by, the, 1880s, and, 1890s, as, republicans, consolidated, their, control, over, the, political, system, increasing, numbers, of, politicians, intellectuals, and, writers, began, using, the, phrase, colonial, empire, linking, it, to, republicanism, and, the, french, nation, most, frenchmen, ignored, foreign, affairs, and, colonial, issues, in, 1914, the, chief, pressure, group, was, the, parti, colonial, a, coalition, of, 50, organizations, with, a, combined, total, of, only, 5, 000, members, a, hallmark, of, the, french, colonial, project, in, the, late, 19th, century, and, early, 20th, century, was, the, civilising, mission, mission, civilisatrice, the, principle, that, it, was, europe, s, duty, to, bring, civilisation, to, benighted, peoples, as, such, colonial, officials, undertook, a, policy, of, franco, europeanisation, in, french, colonies, most, notably, french, west, africa, and, madagascar, during, the, 19th, century, french, citizenship, along, with, the, right, to, elect, a, deputy, to, the, french, chamber, of, deputies, was, granted, to, the, four, old, colonies, of, guadeloupe, martinique, guyanne, and, r, union, as, well, as, to, the, residents, of, french, india, and, the, four, communes, in, senegal, in, most, cases, the, elected, deputies, were, white, frenchmen, although, there, were, some, blacks, such, as, the, senegalese, blaise, diagne, who, was, elected, in, 1914, racism, and, notions, of, white, supremacy, were, integral, to, justifying, the, concept, of, the, civilizing, mission, french, colonialists, viewed, non, european, societies, as, uncivilized, and, their, colonial, subjects, as, needing, european, re, education, racial, darwinists, like, arthur, de, gobineau, justified, this, ideology, by, falsely, claiming, that, people, of, color, were, biologically, inferior, to, white, people, elsewhere, in, the, largest, and, most, populous, colonies, a, strict, separation, between, sujets, fran, ais, all, the, natives, and, citoyens, fran, ais, all, males, of, european, extraction, with, different, rights, and, duties, was, maintained, until, 1946, as, was, pointed, out, in, a, 1927, treatise, on, french, colonial, law, the, granting, of, french, citizenship, to, natives, was, not, a, right, but, rather, a, privilege, two, 1912, decrees, dealing, with, french, west, africa, and, french, equatorial, africa, enumerated, the, conditions, that, a, native, had, to, meet, in, order, to, be, granted, french, citizenship, they, included, speaking, and, writing, french, earning, a, decent, living, and, displaying, good, moral, standards, from, 1830, to, 1946, only, between, 3, 000, and, 6, 000, muslim, native, algerians, were, granted, french, citizenship, in, french, west, africa, outside, of, the, four, communes, there, were, 2, 500, citoyens, indig, nes, out, of, a, total, population, of, 15, million, french, conservatives, had, been, denouncing, the, assimilationist, policies, as, products, of, a, dangerous, liberal, fantasy, in, the, protectorate, of, morocco, the, french, administration, attempted, to, use, urban, planning, and, colonial, education, to, prevent, cultural, mixing, and, to, uphold, the, traditional, society, upon, which, the, french, depended, for, collaboration, with, mixed, results, after, world, war, ii, the, segregationist, approach, modeled, in, morocco, had, been, discredited, by, its, connections, to, vichyism, and, assimilationism, enjoyed, a, brief, renaissance, david, p, forsythe, wrote, from, senegal, and, mauritania, in, the, west, to, niger, in, the, east, what, became, french, africa, there, was, a, parallel, series, of, ruinous, wars, resulting, in, tremendous, numbers, of, people, being, violently, enslaved, at, the, beginning, of, the, twentieth, century, there, may, have, been, between, 3, and, 3, 5, million, slaves, representing, over, 30, percent, of, the, total, population, within, this, sparsely, populated, region, in, 1905, the, french, abolished, slavery, in, most, of, french, west, africa, from, 1906, to, 1911, over, a, million, slaves, in, french, west, africa, fled, from, their, masters, to, earlier, homes, in, madagascar, over, 500, 000, slaves, were, freed, following, french, abolition, in, 1896, french, colonial, officials, influenced, by, the, revolutionary, ideal, of, equality, standardized, schools, curricula, and, teaching, methods, as, much, as, possible, they, did, not, establish, colonial, school, systems, with, the, idea, of, furthering, the, ambitions, of, the, local, people, but, rather, simply, exported, the, systems, and, methods, in, vogue, in, the, mother, nation, having, a, moderately, trained, lower, bureaucracy, was, of, great, use, to, colonial, officials, the, emerging, french, educated, indigenous, elite, saw, little, value, in, educating, rural, peoples, after, 1946, the, policy, was, to, bring, the, best, students, to, paris, for, advanced, training, the, result, was, to, immerse, the, next, generation, of, leaders, in, the, growing, anti, colonial, diaspora, centered, in, paris, impressionistic, colonials, could, mingle, with, studious, scholars, or, radical, revolutionaries, or, so, everything, in, between, ho, chi, minh, and, other, young, radicals, in, paris, formed, the, french, communist, party, in, 1920, tunisia, was, exceptional, the, colony, was, administered, by, paul, cambon, who, built, an, educational, system, for, colonists, and, indigenous, people, alike, that, was, closely, modeled, on, mainland, france, he, emphasized, female, and, vocational, education, by, independence, the, quality, of, tunisian, education, nearly, equalled, that, in, france, african, nationalists, rejected, such, a, public, education, system, which, they, perceived, as, an, attempt, to, retard, african, development, and, maintain, colonial, superiority, one, of, the, first, demands, of, the, emerging, nationalist, movement, after, world, war, ii, was, the, introduction, of, full, metropolitan, style, education, in, french, west, africa, with, its, promise, of, equality, with, europeans, in, algeria, the, debate, was, polarized, the, french, set, up, schools, based, on, the, scientific, method, and, french, culture, the, pied, noir, catholic, migrants, from, europe, welcomed, this, those, goals, were, rejected, by, the, moslem, arabs, who, prized, mental, agility, and, their, distinctive, religious, tradition, the, arabs, refused, to, become, patriotic, and, cultured, frenchmen, and, a, unified, educational, system, was, impossible, until, the, pied, noir, and, their, arab, allies, went, into, exile, after, 1962, critics, of, french, colonialism, gained, an, international, audience, in, the, 1920s, and, often, used, documentary, reportage, and, access, to, agencies, such, as, the, league, of, nations, and, the, international, labour, organization, to, make, their, protests, heard, the, main, criticism, was, the, high, level, of, violence, and, suffering, among, the, natives, major, critics, included, albert, londres, f, licien, challaye, and, paul, monet, whose, books, and, articles, were, widely, read, the, french, colonial, empire, began, to, fall, during, the, second, world, war, when, various, parts, were, occupied, by, foreign, powers, japan, in, indochina, britain, in, syria, lebanon, and, madagascar, the, united, states, and, britain, in, morocco, and, algeria, and, germany, and, italy, in, tunisia, however, control, was, gradually, reestablished, by, charles, de, gaulle, the, french, union, included, in, the, constitution, of, 1946, nominally, replaced, the, former, colonial, empire, but, officials, in, paris, remained, in, full, control, the, colonies, were, given, local, assemblies, with, only, limited, local, power, and, budgets, there, emerged, a, group, of, elites, known, as, evolu, s, who, were, natives, of, the, overseas, territories, but, lived, in, metropolitan, france, 1941, 1942, 1944, 1945, during, world, war, ii, allied, free, france, often, with, british, support, and, axis, aligned, vichy, france, struggled, for, control, of, the, colonies, sometimes, with, outright, military, combat, by, 1943, all, of, the, colonies, except, for, indochina, under, japanese, control, had, joined, the, free, french, cause, the, overseas, empire, helped, liberate, france, as, 300, 000, north, african, arabs, fought, in, the, ranks, of, the, free, french, however, charles, de, gaulle, had, no, intention, of, liberating, the, colonies, he, assembled, the, conference, of, colonial, governors, excluding, the, nationalist, leaders, in, brazzaville, in, january, 1944, to, announce, plans, for, postwar, union, that, would, replace, the, empire, the, brazzaville, manifesto, proclaimed, the, manifesto, angered, nationalists, across, the, empire, and, set, the, stage, for, long, term, wars, in, indochina, and, algeria, that, france, would, lose, in, humiliating, fashion, france, was, immediately, confronted, with, the, beginnings, of, the, decolonisation, movement, in, algeria, demonstrations, in, may, 1945, were, repressed, with, an, estimated, 6, 000, to, 45, 000, algerians, killed, unrest, in, haiphong, indochina, in, november, 1945, was, met, by, a, warship, bombarding, the, city, paul, ramadier, s, sfio, cabinet, repressed, the, malagasy, uprising, in, madagascar, in, 1947, the, french, blamed, education, french, officials, estimated, the, number, of, malagasy, killed, from, a, low, of, 11, 000, to, a, french, army, estimate, of, 89, 000, also, in, indochina, ho, chi, minh, s, viet, minh, which, was, backed, by, the, soviet, union, and, china, declared, vietnam, s, independence, which, started, the, first, indochina, war, the, war, dragged, on, until, 1954, when, the, viet, minh, decisively, defeated, the, french, at, the, battle, of, i, n, bi, n, ph, in, northern, vietnam, which, was, the, last, major, battle, between, the, french, and, the, vietnamese, in, the, first, indochina, war, following, the, vietnamese, victory, at, i, n, bi, n, ph, and, the, signing, of, the, 1954, geneva, accords, france, agreed, to, withdraw, its, forces, from, all, its, colonies, in, french, indochina, while, stipulating, that, vietnam, would, be, temporarily, divided, at, the, 17th, parallel, with, control, of, the, north, given, to, the, soviet, backed, viet, minh, as, the, democratic, republic, of, vietnam, under, ho, chi, minh, and, the, south, becoming, the, state, of, vietnam, under, former, nguyen, dynasty, emperor, b, o, i, who, abdicated, following, the, 1945, august, revolution, under, pressure, from, ho, however, in, 1955, the, state, of, vietnam, s, prime, minister, ng, nh, di, m, toppled, b, o, i, in, a, fraud, ridden, referendum, and, proclaimed, himself, president, of, the, new, republic, of, vietnam, the, refusal, of, ng, nh, di, m, the, us, supported, president, of, the, first, republic, of, vietnam, to, allow, elections, in, 1956, as, had, been, stipulated, by, the, geneva, conference, in, fear, of, ho, chi, minh, s, victory, and, subsequently, a, total, communist, takeover, eventually, led, to, the, vietnam, war, in, france, s, african, colonies, the, union, of, the, peoples, of, cameroon, s, insurrection, which, started, in, 1955, and, headed, by, ruben, um, nyob, was, violently, repressed, over, a, two, year, period, with, perhaps, as, many, as, 100, people, killed, however, france, formally, relinquished, its, protectorate, over, morocco, and, granted, it, independence, in, 1956, french, involvement, in, algeria, stretched, back, a, century, the, movements, of, ferhat, abbas, and, messali, hadj, had, marked, the, period, between, the, two, world, wars, but, both, sides, radicalised, after, the, second, world, war, in, 1945, the, s, tif, massacre, was, carried, out, by, the, french, army, the, algerian, war, started, in, 1954, atrocities, characterized, both, sides, and, the, number, killed, became, highly, controversial, estimates, that, were, made, for, propaganda, purposes, algeria, was, a, three, way, conflict, due, to, the, large, number, of, pieds, noirs, europeans, who, had, settled, there, in, the, 125, years, of, french, rule, the, political, crisis, in, france, caused, the, collapse, of, the, fourth, republic, as, charles, de, gaulle, returned, to, power, in, 1958, and, finally, pulled, the, french, soldiers, and, settlers, out, of, algeria, by, 1962, the, french, union, was, replaced, in, the, constitution, of, 1958, by, the, french, community, only, guinea, refused, by, referendum, to, take, part, in, the, new, organisation, however, the, french, community, ceased, to, operate, before, the, end, of, the, algerian, war, almost, all, of, the, other, former, african, colonies, achieved, independence, in, 1960, the, french, government, refused, to, allow, the, populations, of, the, former, colonies, the, right, they, had, in, the, new, french, constitution, of, 1958, as, french, citizens, with, equal, rights, to, choose, for, their, territories, to, become, full, d, partements, of, france, the, french, government, had, ensured, that, a, constitutional, law, 60, 525, was, passed, which, removed, the, need, for, a, referendum, in, a, territory, to, confirm, a, change, in, status, towards, independence, or, d, partementalisation, so, the, voters, who, had, rejected, independence, in, 1958, were, not, consulted, about, it, in, 1960, there, are, still, a, few, former, colonies, that, chose, to, remain, part, of, france, under, the, status, of, overseas, d, partements, or, territories, critics, of, neocolonialism, claimed, that, the, fran, afrique, had, replaced, formal, direct, rule, they, argued, that, while, de, gaulle, was, granting, independence, on, one, hand, he, was, maintaining, french, dominance, through, the, operations, of, jacques, foccart, his, counsellor, for, african, matters, foccart, supported, in, particular, biafra, in, the, nigerian, civil, war, during, the, late, 1960s, robert, aldrich, argues, that, with, algerian, independence, in, 1962, it, appeared, that, the, empire, practically, had, come, to, an, end, as, the, remaining, colonies, were, quite, small, and, lacked, active, nationalist, movements, however, there, was, trouble, in, french, somaliland, djibouti, which, became, independent, in, 1977, there, also, were, complications, and, delays, in, the, new, hebrides, vanuatu, which, was, the, last, to, gain, independence, in, 1980, new, caledonia, remains, a, special, case, under, french, suzerainty, the, indian, ocean, island, of, mayotte, voted, in, referendum, in, 1974, to, retain, its, link, with, france, and, not, become, independent, like, the, other, three, islands, of, the, comoro, archipelago, french, census, statistics, from, 1936, show, an, imperial, population, outside, of, metropolitan, france, itself, of, 69, 1, million, people, of, the, total, population, 16, 1, million, lived, in, north, africa, 25,

of, europeans, lived, in, north, africa, non, european, french, citizens, lived, essentially, in, the, four, old, colonies, r, union, martinique, guadeloupe, and, french, guiana, as, well, as, in, the, four, communes, of, senegal, saint, louis, dakar, gor, e, and, rufisque, and, in, the, colonies, of, the, south, pacific, unlike, elsewhere, in, europe, france, experienced, relatively, low, levels, of, emigration, to, the, americas, except, for, the, huguenots, in, british, or, dutch, colonies, france, generally, had, close, to, the, slowest, natural, population, growth, in, europe, and, emigration, pressures, were, therefore, quite, small, a, small, but, significant, emigration, numbering, only, in, the, tens, of, thousands, of, mainly, roman, catholic, french, populations, led, to, the, settlement, of, the, provinces, of, acadia, canada, and, louisiana, both, at, the, time, french, possessions, and, colonies, in, the, west, indies, mascarene, islands, and, africa, in, new,
