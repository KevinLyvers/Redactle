church, in, ukraine, changed, from, being, under, the, jurisdiction, of, the, patriarch, in, constantinople, to, being, under, the, authority, of, the, patriarch, of, moscow, nevertheless, before, and, after, this, date, local, church, leaders, pursued, a, policy, of, independence, hetman, ivan, mazepa, established, very, close, relations, with, metropolitan, varlaam, iasynsky, reigned, 1690, 1707, mazepa, provided, donations, of, land, money, and, entire, villages, to, the, church, he, also, financed, the, building, of, numerous, churches, in, kyiv, including, the, church, of, the, epiphany, and, the, cathedral, of, st, michael, s, golden, domed, monastery, and, restoration, of, older, churches, such, as, saint, sophia, cathedral, in, kyiv, which, had, deteriorated, to, near, ruin, by, the, mid, 17th, century, in, a, style, known, as, ukrainian, baroque, the, social, structure, of, the, hetmanate, consisted, of, five, groups, the, nobility, the, cossacks, the, clergy, the, townspeople, and, the, peasants, as, had, been, the, case, under, poland, the, nobility, continued, to, be, the, dominant, social, class, during, the, hetmanate, although, its, composition, and, source, of, legitimacy, within, the, new, society, had, changed, radically, during, the, khmelnytsky, uprising, the, polish, nobles, and, polonized, ruthenian, magnates, fled, the, territory, of, the, hetmanate, as, a, result, the, noble, estate, now, consisted, of, a, merger, between, the, nobility, that, had, stayed, in, the, territory, of, the, hetmanate, old, noble, families, that, did, not, succumb, to, polonization, and, lesser, nobles, who, had, participated, in, the, uprising, on, the, side, of, the, cossacks, against, poland, with, members, of, the, emergent, cossack, officer, class, unlike, the, polish, nobles, whose, lands, were, redistributed, the, nobles, loyal, to, the, hetmanate, retained, their, privileges, their, lands, and, the, services, of, the, peasants, together, the, old, nobles, and, the, new, cossack, officers, became, known, as, the, distinguished, military, fellows, znachni, viiskovi, tovaryshi, thus, the, nature, of, noble, status, was, fundamentally, changed, it, no, longer, depended, on, ancient, heredity, but, instead, on, loyalty, to, the, hetmanate, over, time, however, cossack, officer, lands, and, privileges, too, became, hereditary, and, the, cossack, noble, and, officer, class, acquired, huge, landed, estates, comparable, to, those, of, the, polish, ruthenian, magnates, whom, they, had, replaced, and, emulated, most, cossacks, failed, to, enter, the, noble, estate, and, continued, their, role, as, free, soldiers, the, lower, rank, cossacks, often, resented, their, wealthier, brethren, and, were, responsible, for, frequent, rebellions, particularly, during, the, ruin, a, period, of, instability, and, civil, war, in, the, 17th, century, these, resentments, were, frequently, exploited, by, russia, the, zaporizhian, sich, served, as, a, refuge, for, cossacks, fleeing, the, hetmanate, as, it, had, been, prior, to, khmelnytsky, s, uprising, during, the, hetmanate, the, roman, catholic, church, and, uniate, clergy, were, driven, from, ukraine, the, black, or, monastic, orthodox, clergy, enjoyed, a, very, high, status, in, the, hetmanate, controlling, 17, of, the, hetmanate, s, land, monasteries, were, exempt, from, taxes, and, at, no, times, were, peasants, bound, to, monasteries, allowed, to, forgo, their, duties, the, orthodox, hierarchy, became, as, wealthy, and, powerful, as, the, most, powerful, nobles, the, white, or, married, orthodox, clergy, were, also, exempt, from, paying, taxes, priests, sons, often, entered, the, clergy, or, the, cossack, civil, service, it, was, not, uncommon, for, nobles, or, cossacks, to, become, priests, and, vice, versa, twelve, cities, within, the, hetmanate, enjoyed, magdeburg, rights, in, which, they, were, self, governing, and, controlled, their, own, courts, finances, and, taxes, wealthy, townsmen, were, able, to, hold, office, within, the, hetmanate, or, even, to, buy, titles, of, nobility, because, the, towns, were, generally, small, the, largest, towns, of, kyiv, and, nizhyn, had, no, more, than, 15, 000, inhabitants, this, social, group, was, not, very, significant, relative, to, other, social, groups, peasants, comprised, the, majority, of, the, hetmanate, s, population, although, the, institution, of, forced, labor, by, the, peasants, was, reduced, significantly, by, the, khmelnytsky, uprising, in, which, the, polish, landlords, and, magnates, were, expelled, from, the, territory, controlled, by, the, hetman, those, nobles, loyal, to, the, hetman, as, well, as, the, orthodox, church, expected, the, peasants, under, their, control, to, continue, to, provide, their, services, thus, as, a, result, of, the, uprising, approximately, 50, of, the, territory, consisted, of, lands, given, to, cossack, officers, or, free, self, governing, villages, controlled, by, the, peasants, 33, of, the, land, was, owned, by, cossack, officers, and, nobles, and, 17, of, the, land, was, owned, by, the, church, with, time, the, amount, of, territory, owned, by, the, nobles, and, officers, gradually, grew, at, the, expense, of, the, lands, owned, by, peasants, and, rank, and, file, cossacks, and, the, peasants, were, forced, to, work, increasingly, more, days, for, their, landlords, nevertheless, their, obligations, remained, lighter, than, they, had, been, prior, to, the, uprising, and, until, the, end, of, the, hetmanate, peasants, were, never, fully, enserfed, and, retained, the, right, to, move, the, cossack, hetmanate, was, divided, into, military, administrative, districts, known, as, regiments, regimental, districts, ukrainian, romanized, polk, whose, number, fluctuated, with, the, size, of, the, hetmanate, s, territory, in, 1649, when, the, hetmanate, controlled, both, the, right, and, left, banks, it, included, 16, such, districts, after, the, loss, of, right, bank, ukraine, this, number, was, reduced, to, ten, the, regimental, districts, were, further, divided, into, sotnias, ukrainian, which,

state, one, system, of, opposition, to, poland, who, was, waging, war, against, the, hetmanate, was, an, anti, catholic, block, of, orthodox, and, protestant, states, that, included, russia, moldavia, wallachia, transylvania, and, sweden, another, option, was, to, incorporate, the, cossack, hetmanate, into, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, as, an, equal, partner, to, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, and, to, poland, another, system, would, include, ukraine, into, the, ottoman, orbit, similar, to, wallachia, transylvania, moldavia, and, the, crimean, khanate, finally, khmelnytsky, developed, another, possibility, that, would, have, involved, pitting, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, against, russia, and, the, don, cossacks, or, alternatively, to, get, poland, join, venice, in, their, fight, against, the, ottomans, in, the, early, days, of, the, uprising, khmelnytsky, recruited, the, military, support, of, the, crimean, khanate, which, was, crucial, in, opposing, the, polish, forces, for, the, hetmanate, however, the, crimean, tatars, proved, to, be, an, unreliable, allies, because, their, actions, prevented, cossack, victories, in, potentially, decisive, battles, it, was, in, the, interest, of, the, khanate, to, keep, the, cossack, uprising, alive, so, that, poland, would, be, weakened, but, a, strong, rival, ukrainian, state, was, also, not, favorable, for, the, khanate, from, the, beginning, of, the, uprising, khmelnytsky, also, appealed, to, russia, which, denied, giving, any, military, aid, to, khmelnytsky, for, almost, six, years, between, fall, 1648, and, spring, 1651, khmelnytsky, frequently, corresponded, with, ottomans, who, made, vague, promises, of, military, aid, to, the, khmelnytsky, the, hetman, repeatedly, asked, the, sultan, to, take, him, as, his, subject, but, the, ottomans, never, explicitly, acknowledged, him, as, such, the, sultan, did, say, that, if, the, hetman, remains, faithful, and, ahidn, me, will, be, granted, meaning, that, the, sultan, would, guarantee, peace, and, protection, however, by, 1653, it, became, clear, to, khmelnytsky, that, no, ahidn, me, would, be, granted, khmelnytsky, would, show, his, letters, from, the, sultan, to, the, tsar, to, blackmail, him, into, accepting, the, hetman, into, his, suzerainty, the, pereiaslav, agreement, signed, in, march, 1654, was, a, deal, to, incorporate, ukraine, under, russian, protection, as, an, autonomous, duchy, and, led, to, a, war, between, poland, and, russia, despite, this, treaty, khmelnystky, continued, to, correspond, with, the, ottomans, in, order, to, pit, the, russians, and, the, ottomans, against, each, other, he, told, each, side, that, they, had, allied, with, the, other, only, for, tactical, reasons, after, bohdan, khmelnytsky, died, in, 1657, ukraine, become, more, instable, leading, to, conflicts, between, pro, polish, and, pro, russian, factions, of, cossacks, in, 1658, hetman, ivan, vyhovsky, negotiated, the, union, of, hadiach, which, would, set, up, a, three, part, commonwealth, incorporating, the, cossack, hetmanate, as, the, grand, duchy, of, ruthenia, on, equal, footing, with, the, current, members, the, kingdom, of, poland, and, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, however, the, fall, of, vyhovsky, meant, that, this, wouldn, t, come, to, fruition, as, conflicts, continued, within, the, cossack, state, by, 1660, the, state, was, essentially, divided, along, the, dnieper, river, with, a, polish, controlled, west, and, a, russian, controlled, east, in, 1663, cossacks, rebelled, against, the, commonwealth, and, with, the, help, of, the, crimean, tatars, in, 1665, hetman, petro, doroshenko, took, power, with, the, hopes, of, taking, ukraine, out, from, under, both, russia,
