the, industrial, revolution, sometimes, divided, into, the, first, industrial, revolution, and, second, industrial, revolution, was, a, period, of, global, transition, of, the, human, economy, towards, more, widespread, efficient, and, stable, manufacturing, processes, that, succeeded, the, agricultural, revolution, beginning, in, great, britain, the, industrial, revolution, spread, to, continental, europe, and, the, united, states, from, around, 1760, to, about, 1820, 1840, this, transition, included, going, from, hand, production, methods, to, machines, new, chemical, manufacturing, and, iron, production, processes, the, increasing, use, of, water, power, and, steam, power, the, development, of, machine, tools, and, the, rise, of, the, mechanised, factory, system, output, greatly, increased, and, the, result, was, an, unprecedented, rise, in, population, and, the, rate, of, population, growth, the, textile, industry, was, the, first, to, use, modern, production, methods, 40, and, textiles, became, the, dominant, industry, in, terms, of, employment, value, of, output, and, capital, invested, many, of, the, technological, and, architectural, innovations, were, of, british, origin, by, the, mid, 18th, century, britain, was, the, world, s, leading, commercial, nation, controlling, a, global, trading, empire, with, colonies, in, north, america, and, the, caribbean, britain, had, major, military, and, political, hegemony, on, the, indian, subcontinent, particularly, with, the, proto, industrialised, mughal, bengal, through, the, activities, of, the, east, india, company, the, development, of, trade, and, the, rise, of, business, were, among, the, major, causes, of, the, industrial, revolution, 15, developments, in, law, also, facilitated, the, revolution, such, as, courts, ruling, in, favour, of, property, rights, an, entrepreneurial, spirit, and, consumer, revolution, helped, drive, industrialisation, in, britain, which, after, 1800, was, emulated, in, belgium, the, united, states, and, france, the, industrial, revolution, marked, a, major, turning, point, in, history, comparable, only, to, humanity, s, adoption, of, agriculture, with, respect, to, material, advancement, the, industrial, revolution, influenced, in, some, way, almost, every, aspect, of, daily, life, in, particular, average, income, and, population, began, to, exhibit, unprecedented, sustained, growth, some, economists, have, said, the, most, important, effect, of, the, industrial, revolution, was, that, the, standard, of, living, for, the, general, population, in, the, western, world, began, to, increase, consistently, for, the, first, time, in, history, although, others, have, said, that, it, did, not, begin, to, improve, meaningfully, until, the, late, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, gdp, per, capita, was, broadly, stable, before, the, industrial, revolution, and, the, emergence, of, the, modern, capitalist, economy, while, the, industrial, revolution, began, an, era, of, per, capita, economic, growth, in, capitalist, economies, economic, historians, agree, that, the, onset, of, the, industrial, revolution, is, the, most, important, event, in, human, history, since, the, domestication, of, animals, and, plants, the, precise, start, and, end, of, the, industrial, revolution, is, still, debated, among, historians, as, is, the, pace, of, economic, and, social, changes, according, to, cambridge, historian, leigh, shaw, taylor, britain, was, already, industrialising, in, the, 17th, century, and, our, database, shows, that, a, groundswell, of, enterprise, and, productivity, transformed, the, economy, in, the, 17th, century, laying, the, foundations, for, the, world, s, first, industrial, economy, britain, was, already, a, nation, of, makers, by, the, year, 1700, and, the, history, of, britain, needs, to, be, rewritten, eric, hobsbawm, held, that, the, industrial, revolution, began, in, britain, in, the, 1780s, and, was, not, fully, felt, until, the, 1830s, or, 1840s, while, t, s, ashton, held, that, it, occurred, roughly, between, 1760, and, 1830, rapid, adoption, of, mechanized, textiles, spinning, occurred, in, britain, in, the, 1780s, and, high, rates, of, growth, in, steam, power, and, iron, production, occurred, after, 1800, mechanised, textile, production, spread, from, great, britain, to, continental, europe, and, the, united, states, in, the, early, 19th, century, with, important, centres, of, textiles, iron, and, coal, emerging, in, belgium, and, the, united, states, and, later, textiles, in, france, an, economic, recession, occurred, from, the, late, 1830s, to, the, early, 1840s, when, the, adoption, of, the, industrial, revolution, s, early, innovations, such, as, mechanised, spinning, and, weaving, slowed, as, their, markets, matured, and, despite, the, increasing, adoption, of, locomotives, steamboats, and, steamships, and, hot, blast, iron, smelting, new, technologies, such, as, the, electrical, telegraph, widely, introduced, in, the, 1840s, and, 1850s, in, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, were, not, powerful, enough, to, drive, high, rates, of, economic, growth, rapid, economic, growth, began, to, reoccur, after, 1870, springing, from, a, new, group, of, innovations, in, what, has, been, called, the, second, industrial, revolution, these, included, new, steel, making, processes, mass, production, assembly, lines, electrical, grid, systems, the, large, scale, manufacture, of, machine, tools, and, the, use, of, increasingly, advanced, machinery, in, steam, powered, factories, the, earliest, recorded, use, of, the, term, industrial, revolution, was, in, july, 1799, by, french, envoy, louis, guillaume, otto, announcing, that, france, had, entered, the, race, to, industrialise, in, his, 1976, book, keywords, a, vocabulary, of, culture, and, society, raymond, williams, states, in, the, entry, for, industry, the, idea, of, a, new, social, order, based, on, major, industrial, change, was, clear, in, southey, and, owen, between, 1811, and, 1818, and, was, implicit, as, early, as, blake, in, the, early, 1790s, and, wordsworth, at, the, turn, of, the, century, the, term, industrial, revolution, applied, to, technological, change, was, becoming, more, common, by, the, late, 1830s, as, in, j, r, me, adolphe, blanqui, s, description, in, 1837, of, la, r, volution, industrielle, friedrich, engels, in, the, condition, of, the, working, class, in, england, in, 1844, spoke, of, an, industrial, revolution, a, revolution, which, at, the, same, time, changed, the, whole, of, civil, society, although, engels, wrote, his, book, in, the, 1840s, it, was, not, translated, into, english, until, the, late, 19th, century, and, his, expression, did, not, enter, everyday, language, until, then, credit, for, popularising, the, term, may, be, given, to, arnold, toynbee, whose, 1881, lectures, gave, a, detailed, account, of, the, term, economic, historians, and, authors, such, as, mendels, pomeranz, and, kridte, argue, that, proto, industrialisation, in, parts, of, europe, the, muslim, world, mughal, india, and, china, created, the, social, and, economic, conditions, that, led, to, the, industrial, revolution, thus, causing, the, great, divergence, some, historians, such, as, john, clapham, and, nicholas, crafts, have, argued, that, the, economic, and, social, changes, occurred, gradually, and, that, the, term, revolution, is, a, misnomer, this, is, still, a, subject, of, debate, among, some, historians, six, factors, facilitated, industrialisation, high, levels, of, agricultural, productivity, such, as, that, reflected, in, the, british, agricultural, revolution, to, provide, excess, manpower, and, food, a, pool, of, managerial, and, entrepreneurial, skills, available, ports, rivers, canals, and, roads, to, cheaply, move, raw, materials, and, outputs, natural, resources, such, as, coal, iron, and, waterfalls, political, stability, and, a, legal, system, that, supported, business, and, financial, capital, available, to, invest, once, industrialisation, began, in, great, britain, new, factors, can, be, added, the, eagerness, of, british, entrepreneurs, to, export, industrial, expertise, and, the, willingness, to, import, the, process, britain, met, the, criteria, and, industrialized, starting, in, the, 18th, century, and, then, it, exported, the, process, to, western, europe, especially, belgium, france, and, the, german, states, in, the, early, 19th, century, the, united, states, copied, the, british, model, in, the, early, 19th, century, and, japan, copied, the, western, european, models, in, the, late, 19th, century, the, commencement, of, the, industrial, revolution, is, closely, linked, to, a, small, number, of, innovations, beginning, in, the, second, half, of, the, 18th, century, by, the, 1830s, the, following, gains, had, been, made, in, important, technologies, in, 1750, britain, imported, 2, 5, million, pounds, of, raw, cotton, most, of, which, was, spun, and, woven, by, the, cottage, industry, in, lancashire, the, work, was, done, by, hand, in, workers, homes, or, occasionally, in, master, weavers, shops, wages, in, lancashire, were, about, six, times, those, in, india, in, 1770, when, overall, productivity, in, britain, was, about, three, times, higher, than, in, india, in, 1787, raw, cotton, consumption, was, 22, million, pounds, most, of, which, was, cleaned, carded, and, spun, on, machines, 41, 42, the, british, textile, industry, used, 52, million, pounds, of, cotton, in, 1800, which, increased, to, 588, million, pounds, in, 1850, the, share, of, value, added, by, the, cotton, textile, industry, in, britain, was, 2, 6, in, 1760, 17, in, 1801, and, 22, 4, in, 1831, value, added, by, the, british, woollen, industry, was, 14, 1, in, 1801, cotton, factories, in, britain, numbered, approximately, 900, in, 1797, in, 1760, approximately, one, third, of, cotton, cloth, manufactured, in, britain, was, exported, rising, to, two, thirds, by, 1800, in, 1781, cotton, spun, amounted, to, 5, 1, million, pounds, which, increased, to, 56, million, pounds, by, 1800, in, 1800, less, than, 0, 1, of, world, cotton, cloth, was, produced, on, machinery, invented, in, britain, in, 1788, there, were, 50, 000, spindles, in, britain, rising, to, 7, million, over, the, next, 30, years, the, earliest, european, attempts, at, mechanised, spinning, were, with, wool, however, wool, spinning, proved, more, difficult, to, mechanise, than, cotton, productivity, improvement, in, wool, spinning, during, the, industrial, revolution, was, significant, but, far, less, than, that, of, cotton, arguably, the, first, highly, mechanised, factory, was, john, lombe, s, water, powered, silk, mill, at, derby, operational, by, 1721, lombe, learned, silk, thread, manufacturing, by, taking, a, job, in, italy, and, acting, as, an, industrial, spy, however, because, the, italian, silk, industry, guarded, its, secrets, closely, the, state, of, the, industry, at, that, time, is, unknown, although, lombe, s, factory, was, technically, successful, the, supply, of, raw, silk, from, italy, was, cut, off, to, eliminate, competition, in, order, to, promote, manufacturing, the, crown, paid, for, models, of, lombe, s, machinery, which, were, exhibited, in, the, tower, of, london, parts, of, india, china, central, america, south, america, and, the, middle, east, have, a, long, history, of, hand, manufacturing, cotton, textiles, which, became, a, major, industry, sometime, after, 1000, ad, in, tropical, and, subtropical, regions, where, it, was, grown, most, was, grown, by, small, farmers, alongside, their, food, crops, and, was, spun, and, woven, in, households, largely, for, domestic, consumption, in, the, 15th, century, china, began, to, require, households, to, pay, part, of, their, taxes, in, cotton, cloth, by, the, 17th, century, almost, all, chinese, wore, cotton, clothing, almost, everywhere, cotton, cloth, could, be, used, as, a, medium, of, exchange, in, india, a, significant, amount, of, cotton, textiles, were, manufactured, for, distant, markets, often, produced, by, professional, weavers, some, merchants, also, owned, small, weaving, workshops, india, produced, a, variety, of, cotton, cloth, some, of, exceptionally, fine, quality, cotton, was, a, difficult, raw, material, for, europe, to, obtain, before, it, was, grown, on, colonial, plantations, in, the, americas, the, early, spanish, explorers, found, native, americans, growing, unknown, species, of, excellent, quality, cotton, sea, island, cotton, gossypium, barbadense, and, upland, green, seeded, cotton, gossypium, hirsutum, sea, island, cotton, grew, in, tropical, areas, and, on, barrier, islands, of, georgia, and, south, carolina, but, did, poorly, inland, sea, island, cotton, began, being, exported, from, barbados, in, the, 1650s, upland, green, seeded, cotton, grew, well, on, inland, areas, of, the, southern, u, s, but, was, not, economical, because, of, the, difficulty, of, removing, seed, a, problem, solved, by, the, cotton, gin, 157, a, strain, of, cotton, seed, brought, from, mexico, to, natchez, mississippi, in, 1806, became, the, parent, genetic, material, for, over, 90, of, world, cotton, production, today, it, produced, bolls, that, were, three, to, four, times, faster, to, pick, the, age, of, discovery, was, followed, by, a, period, of, colonialism, beginning, around, the, 16th, century, following, the, discovery, of, a, trade, route, to, india, around, southern, africa, by, the, portuguese, the, british, founded, the, east, india, company, along, with, smaller, companies, of, different, nationalities, which, established, trading, posts, and, employed, agents, to, engage, in, trade, throughout, the, indian, ocean, region, one, of, the, largest, segments, of, this, trade, was, in, cotton, textiles, which, were, purchased, in, india, and, sold, in, southeast, asia, including, the, indonesian, archipelago, where, spices, were, purchased, for, sale, to, southeast, asia, and, europe, by, the, mid, 1760s, cloth, was, over, three, quarters, of, the, east, india, company, s, exports, indian, textiles, were, in, demand, in, the, north, atlantic, region, of, europe, where, previously, only, wool, and, linen, were, available, however, the, number, of, cotton, goods, consumed, in, western, europe, was, minor, until, the, early, 19th, century, by, 1600, flemish, refugees, began, weaving, cotton, cloth, in, english, towns, where, cottage, spinning, and, weaving, of, wool, and, linen, was, well, established, they, were, left, alone, by, the, guilds, who, did, not, consider, cotton, a, threat, earlier, european, attempts, at, cotton, spinning, and, weaving, were, in, 12th, century, italy, and, 15th, century, southern, germany, but, these, industries, eventually, ended, when, the, supply, of, cotton, was, cut, off, the, moors, in, spain, grew, spun, and, wove, cotton, beginning, around, the, 10th, century, british, cloth, could, not, compete, with, indian, cloth, because, india, s, labour, cost, was, approximately, one, fifth, to, one, sixth, that, of, britain, s, in, 1700, and, 1721, the, british, government, passed, calico, acts, to, protect, the, domestic, woollen, and, linen, industries, from, the, increasing, amounts, of, cotton, fabric, imported, from, india, the, demand, for, heavier, fabric, was, met, by, a, domestic, industry, based, around, lancashire, that, produced, fustian, a, cloth, with, flax, warp, and, cotton, weft, flax, was, used, for, the, warp, because, wheel, spun, cotton, did, not, have, sufficient, strength, but, the, resulting, blend, was, not, as, soft, as, 100, cotton, and, was, more, difficult, to, sew, on, the, eve, of, the, industrial, revolution, spinning, and, weaving, were, done, in, households, for, domestic, consumption, and, as, a, cottage, industry, under, the, putting, out, system, occasionally, the, work, was, done, in, the, workshop, of, a, master, weaver, under, the, putting, out, system, home, based, workers, produced, under, contract, to, merchant, sellers, who, often, supplied, the, raw, materials, in, the, off, season, the, women, typically, farmers, wives, did, the, spinning, and, the, men, did, the, weaving, using, the, spinning, wheel, it, took, anywhere, from, four, to, eight, spinners, to, supply, one, handloom, weaver, 823, the, flying, shuttle, patented, in, 1733, by, john, kay, with, a, number, of, subsequent, improvements, including, an, important, one, in, 1747, doubled, the, output, of, a, weaver, worsening, the, imbalance, between, spinning, and, weaving, it, became, widely, used, around, lancashire, after, 1760, when, john, s, son, robert, invented, the, dropbox, which, facilitated, changing, thread, colors, 821, 822, lewis, paul, patented, the, roller, spinning, frame, and, the, flyer, and, bobbin, system, for, drawing, wool, to, a, more, even, thickness, the, technology, was, developed, with, the, help, of, john, wyatt, of, birmingham, paul, and, wyatt, opened, a, mill, in, birmingham, which, used, their, rolling, machine, powered, by, a, donkey, in, 1743, a, factory, opened, in, northampton, with, 50, spindles, on, each, of, five, of, paul, and, wyatt, s, machines, this, operated, until, about, 1764, a, similar, mill, was, built, by, daniel, bourn, in, leominster, but, this, burnt, down, both, lewis, paul, and, daniel, bourn, patented, carding, machines, in, 1748, based, on, two, sets, of, rollers, that, travelled, at, different, speeds, it, was, later, used, in, the, first, cotton, spinning, mill, in, 1764, in, the, village, of, stanhill, lancashire, james, hargreaves, invented, the, spinning, jenny, which, he, patented, in, 1770, it, was, the, first, practical, spinning, frame, with, multiple, spindles, the, jenny, worked, in, a, similar, manner, to, the, spinning, wheel, by, first, clamping, down, on, the, fibres, then, by, drawing, them, out, followed, by, twisting, it, was, a, simple, wooden, framed, machine, that, only, cost, about, 6, for, a, 40, spindle, model, in, 1792, and, was, used, mainly, by, home, spinners, the, jenny, produced, a, lightly, twisted, yarn, only, suitable, for, weft, not, warp, 825, 827, the, spinning, frame, or, water, frame, was, developed, by, richard, arkwright, who, along, with, two, partners, patented, it, in, 1769, the, design, was, partly, based, on, a, spinning, machine, built, by, kay, who, was, hired, by, arkwright, 827, 830, for, each, spindle, the, water, frame, used, a, series, of, four, pairs, of, rollers, each, operating, at, a, successively, higher, rotating, speed, to, draw, out, the, fibre, which, was, then, twisted, by, the, spindle, the, roller, spacing, was, slightly, longer, than, the, fibre, length, too, close, a, spacing, caused, the, fibres, to, break, while, too, distant, a, spacing, caused, uneven, thread, the, top, rollers, were, leather, covered, and, loading, on, the, rollers, was, applied, by, a, weight, the, weights, kept, the, twist, from, backing, up, before, the, rollers, the, bottom, rollers, were, wood, and, metal, with, fluting, along, the, length, the, water, frame, was, able, to, produce, a, hard, medium, count, thread, suitable, for, warp, finally, allowing, 100, cotton, cloth, to, be, made, in, britain, arkwright, and, his, partners, used, water, power, at, a, factory, in, cromford, derbyshire, in, 1771, giving, the, invention, its, name, samuel, crompton, invented, the, spinning, mule, in, 1779, so, called, because, it, is, a, hybrid, of, arkwright, s, water, frame, and, james, hargreaves, s, spinning, jenny, in, the, same, way, that, a, mule, is, the, product, of, crossbreeding, a, female, horse, with, a, male, donkey, crompton, s, mule, was, able, to, produce, finer, thread, than, hand, spinning, and, at, a, lower, cost, mule, spun, thread, was, of, suitable, strength, to, be, used, as, a, warp, and, finally, allowed, britain, to, produce, highly, competitive, yarn, in, large, quantities, 832, realising, that, the, expiration, of, the, arkwright, patent, would, greatly, increase, the, supply, of, spun, cotton, and, lead, to, a, shortage, of, weavers, edmund, cartwright, developed, a, vertical, power, loom, which, he, patented, in, 1785, in, 1776, he, patented, a, two, man, operated, loom, 834, cartwright, s, loom, design, had, several, flaws, the, most, serious, being, thread, breakage, samuel, horrocks, patented, a, fairly, successful, loom, in, 1813, horock, s, loom, was, improved, by, richard, roberts, in, 1822, and, these, were, produced, in, large, numbers, by, roberts, hill, co, roberts, was, additionally, a, maker, of, high, quality, machine, tools, and, a, pioneer, in, the, use, of, jigs, and, gauges, for, precision, workshop, measurement, the, demand, for, cotton, presented, an, opportunity, to, planters, in, the, southern, united, states, who, thought, upland, cotton, would, be, a, profitable, crop, if, a, better, way, could, be, found, to, remove, the, seed, eli, whitney, responded, to, the, challenge, by, inventing, the, inexpensive, cotton, gin, a, man, using, a, cotton, gin, could, remove, seed, from, as, much, upland, cotton, in, one, day, as, would, previously, have, taken, two, months, to, process, working, at, the, rate, of, one, pound, of, cotton, per, day, these, advances, were, capitalised, on, by, entrepreneurs, of, whom, the, best, known, is, arkwright, he, is, credited, with, a, list, of, inventions, but, these, were, actually, developed, by, such, people, as, kay, and, thomas, highs, arkwright, nurtured, the, inventors, patented, the, ideas, financed, the, initiatives, and, protected, the, machines, he, created, the, cotton, mill, which, brought, the, production, processes, together, in, a, factory, and, he, developed, the, use, of, power, first, horsepower, and, then, water, power, which, made, cotton, manufacture, a, mechanised, industry, other, inventors, increased, the, efficiency, of, the, individual, steps, of, spinning, carding, twisting, and, spinning, and, rolling, so, that, the, supply, of, yarn, increased, greatly, steam, power, was, then, applied, to, drive, textile, machinery, manchester, acquired, the, nickname, cottonopolis, during, the, early, 19th, century, owing, to, its, sprawl, of, textile, factories, although, mechanisation, dramatically, decreased, the, cost, of, cotton, cloth, by, the, mid, 19th, century, machine, woven, cloth, still, could, not, equal, the, quality, of, hand, woven, indian, cloth, in, part, because, of, the, fineness, of, thread, made, possible, by, the, type, of, cotton, used, in, india, which, allowed, high, thread, counts, however, the, high, productivity, of, british, textile, manufacturing, allowed, coarser, grades, of, british, cloth, to, undersell, hand, spun, and, woven, fabric, in, low, wage, india, eventually, destroying, the, indian, industry, bar, iron, was, the, commodity, form, of, iron, used, as, the, raw, material, for, making, hardware, goods, such, as, nails, wire, hinges, horseshoes, wagon, tires, chains, etc, as, well, as, structural, shapes, a, small, amount, of, bar, iron, was, converted, into, steel, cast, iron, was, used, for, pots, stoves, and, other, items, where, its, brittleness, was, tolerable, most, cast, iron, was, refined, and, converted, to, bar, iron, with, substantial, losses, bar, iron, was, made, by, the, bloomery, process, which, was, the, predominant, iron, smelting, process, until, the, late, 18th, century, in, the, uk, in, 1720, there, were, 20, 500, tons, of, cast, iron, produced, with, charcoal, and, 400, tons, with, coke, in, 1750, charcoal, iron, production, was, 24, 500, and, coke, iron, was, 2, 500, tons, in, 1788, the, production, of, charcoal, cast, iron, was, 14, 000, tons, while, coke, iron, production, was, 54, 000, tons, in, 1806, charcoal, cast, iron, production, was, 7, 800, tons, and, coke, cast, iron, was, 250, 000, tons, 125, in, 1750, the, uk, imported, 31, 200, tons, of, bar, iron, and, either, refined, from, cast, iron, or, directly, produced, 18, 800, tons, of, bar, iron, using, charcoal, and, 100, tons, using, coke, in, 1796, the, uk, was, making, 125, 000, tons, of, bar, iron, with, coke, and, 6, 400, tons, with, charcoal, imports, were, 38, 000, tons, and, exports, were, 24, 600, tons, in, 1806, the, uk, did, not, import, bar, iron, but, exported, 31, 500, tons, 125, a, major, change, in, the, iron, industries, during, the, industrial, revolution, was, the, replacement, of, wood, and, other, bio, fuels, with, coal, for, a, given, amount, of, heat, mining, coal, required, much, less, labour, than, cutting, wood, and, converting, it, to, charcoal, and, coal, was, much, more, abundant, than, wood, supplies, of, which, were, becoming, scarce, before, the, enormous, increase, in, iron, production, that, took, place, in, the, late, 18th, century, 122, in, 1709, abraham, darby, made, progress, using, coke, to, fuel, his, blast, furnaces, at, coalbrookdale, however, the, coke, pig, iron, he, made, was, not, suitable, for, making, wrought, iron, and, was, used, mostly, for, the, production, of, cast, iron, goods, such, as, pots, and, kettles, he, had, the, advantage, over, his, rivals, in, that, his, pots, cast, by, his, patented, process, were, thinner, and, cheaper, than, theirs, in, 1750, coke, had, generally, replaced, charcoal, in, the, smelting, of, copper, and, lead, and, was, in, widespread, use, in, glass, production, in, the, smelting, and, refining, of, iron, coal, and, coke, produced, inferior, iron, to, that, made, with, charcoal, because, of, the, coal, s, sulfur, content, low, sulfur, coals, were, known, but, they, still, contained, harmful, amounts, conversion, of, coal, to, coke, only, slightly, reduces, the, sulfur, content, 122, 125, a, minority, of, coals, are, coking, another, factor, limiting, the, iron, industry, before, the, industrial, revolution, was, the, scarcity, of, water, power, to, power, blast, bellows, this, limitation, was, overcome, by, the, steam, engine, use, of, coal, in, iron, smelting, started, somewhat, before, the, industrial, revolution, based, on, innovations, by, clement, clerke, and, others, from, 1678, using, coal, reverberatory, furnaces, known, as, cupolas, these, were, operated, by, the, flames, playing, on, the, ore, and, charcoal, or, coke, mixture, reducing, the, oxide, to, metal, this, has, the, advantage, that, impurities, such, as, sulphur, ash, in, the, coal, do, not, migrate, into, the, metal, this, technology, was, applied, to, lead, from, 1678, and, to, copper, from, 1687, it, was, also, applied, to, iron, foundry, work, in, the, 1690s, but, in, this, case, the, reverberatory, furnace, was, known, as, an, air, furnace, the, foundry, cupola, is, a, different, and, later, innovation, coke, pig, iron, was, hardly, used, to, produce, wrought, iron, until, 1755, 56, when, darby, s, son, abraham, darby, ii, built, furnaces, at, horsehay, and, ketley, where, low, sulfur, coal, was, available, and, not, far, from, coalbrookdale, these, furnaces, were, equipped, with, water, powered, bellows, the, water, being, pumped, by, newcomen, steam, engines, the, newcomen, engines, were, not, attached, directly, to, the, blowing, cylinders, because, the, engines, alone, could, not, produce, a, steady, air, blast, abraham, darby, iii, installed, similar, steam, pumped, water, powered, blowing, cylinders, at, the, dale, company, when, he, took, control, in, 1768, the, dale, company, used, several, newcomen, engines, to, drain, its, mines, and, made, parts, for, engines, which, it, sold, throughout, the, country, 123, 125, steam, engines, made, the, use, of, higher, pressure, and, volume, blast, practical, however, the, leather, used, in, bellows, was, expensive, to, replace, in, 1757, ironmaster, john, wilkinson, patented, a, hydraulic, powered, blowing, engine, for, blast, furnaces, the, blowing, cylinder, for, blast, furnaces, was, introduced, in, 1760, and, the, first, blowing, cylinder, made, of, cast, iron, is, believed, to, be, the, one, used, at, carrington, in, 1768, that, was, designed, by, john, smeaton, 124, 135, cast, iron, cylinders, for, use, with, a, piston, were, difficult, to, manufacture, the, cylinders, had, to, be, free, of, holes, and, had, to, be, machined, smooth, and, straight, to, remove, any, warping, james, watt, had, great, difficulty, trying, to, have, a, cylinder, made, for, his, first, steam, engine, in, 1774, wilkinson, invented, a, precision, boring, machine, for, boring, cylinders, after, wilkinson, bored, the, first, successful, cylinder, for, a, boulton, and, watt, steam, engine, in, 1776, he, was, given, an, exclusive, contract, for, providing, cylinders, after, watt, developed, a, rotary, steam, engine, in, 1782, they, were, widely, applied, to, blowing, hammering, rolling, and, slitting, 124, the, solutions, to, the, sulfur, problem, were, the, addition, of, sufficient, limestone, to, the, furnace, to, force, sulfur, into, the, slag, as, well, as, the, use, of, low, sulfur, coal, the, use, of, lime, or, limestone, required, higher, furnace, temperatures, to, form, a, free, flowing, slag, the, increased, furnace, temperature, made, possible, by, improved, blowing, also, increased, the, capacity, of, blast, furnaces, and, allowed, for, increased, furnace, height, 123, 125, in, addition, to, lower, cost, and, greater, availability, coke, had, other, important, advantages, over, charcoal, in, that, it, was, harder, and, made, the, column, of, materials, iron, ore, fuel, slag, flowing, down, the, blast, furnace, more, porous, and, did, not, crush, in, the, much, taller, furnaces, of, the, late, 19th, century, as, cast, iron, became, cheaper, and, widely, available, it, began, being, a, structural, material, for, bridges, and, buildings, a, famous, early, example, is, the, iron, bridge, built, in, 1778, with, cast, iron, produced, by, abraham, darby, iii, however, most, cast, iron, was, converted, to, wrought, iron, conversion, of, cast, iron, had, long, been, done, in, a, finery, forge, an, improved, refining, process, known, as, potting, and, stamping, was, developed, but, this, was, superseded, by, henry, cort, s, puddling, process, cort, developed, two, significant, iron, manufacturing, processes, rolling, in, 1783, and, puddling, in, 1784, 91, puddling, produced, a, structural, grade, iron, at, a, relatively, low, cost, puddling, was, a, means, of, decarburizing, molten, pig, iron, by, slow, oxidation, in, a, reverberatory, furnace, by, manually, stirring, it, with, a, long, rod, the, decarburized, iron, having, a, higher, melting, point, than, cast, iron, was, raked, into, globs, by, the, puddler, when, the, glob, was, large, enough, the, puddler, would, remove, it, puddling, was, backbreaking, and, extremely, hot, work, few, puddlers, lived, to, be, 40, 218, because, puddling, was, done, in, a, reverberatory, furnace, coal, or, coke, could, be, used, as, fuel, the, puddling, process, continued, to, be, used, until, the, late, 19th, century, when, iron, was, being, displaced, by, mild, steel, because, puddling, required, human, skill, in, sensing, the, iron, globs, it, was, never, successfully, mechanised, rolling, was, an, important, part, of, the, puddling, process, because, the, grooved, rollers, expelled, most, of, the, molten, slag, and, consolidated, the, mass, of, hot, wrought, iron, rolling, was, 15, times, faster, at, this, than, a, trip, hammer, a, different, use, of, rolling, which, was, done, at, lower, temperatures, than, that, for, expelling, slag, was, in, the, production, of, iron, sheets, and, later, structural, shapes, such, as, beams, angles, and, rails, the, puddling, process, was, improved, in, 1818, by, baldwyn, rogers, who, replaced, some, of, the, sand, lining, on, the, reverberatory, furnace, bottom, with, iron, oxide, in, 1838, john, hall, patented, the, use, of, roasted, tap, cinder, iron, silicate, for, the, furnace, bottom, greatly, reducing, the, loss, of, iron, through, increased, slag, caused, by, a, sand, lined, bottom, the, tap, cinder, also, tied, up, some, phosphorus, but, this, was, not, understood, at, the, time, 166, hall, s, process, also, used, iron, scale, or, rust, which, reacted, with, carbon, in, the, molten, iron, hall, s, process, called, wet, puddling, reduced, losses, of, iron, with, the, slag, from, almost, 50, to, around, 8, 93, puddling, became, widely, used, after, 1800, up, to, that, time, british, iron, manufacturers, had, used, considerable, amounts, of, iron, imported, from, sweden, and, russia, to, supplement, domestic, supplies, because, of, the, increased, british, production, imports, began, to, decline, in, 1785, and, by, the, 1790s, britain, eliminated, imports, and, became, a, net, exporter, of, bar, iron, hot, blast, patented, by, the, scottish, inventor, james, beaumont, neilson, in, 1828, was, the, most, important, development, of, the, 19th, century, for, saving, energy, in, making, pig, iron, by, using, preheated, combustion, air, the, amount, of, fuel, to, make, a, unit, of, pig, iron, was, reduced, at, first, by, between, one, third, using, coke, or, two, thirds, using, coal, the, efficiency, gains, continued, as, the, technology, improved, hot, blast, also, raised, the, operating, temperature, of, furnaces, increasing, their, capacity, using, less, coal, or, coke, meant, introducing, fewer, impurities, into, the, pig, iron, this, meant, that, lower, quality, coal, could, be, used, in, areas, where, coking, coal, was, unavailable, or, too, expensive, however, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, transportation, costs, fell, considerably, shortly, before, the, industrial, revolution, an, improvement, was, made, in, the, production, of, steel, which, was, an, expensive, commodity, and, used, only, where, iron, would, not, do, such, as, for, cutting, edge, tools, and, for, springs, benjamin, huntsman, developed, his, crucible, steel, technique, in, the, 1740s, the, raw, material, for, this, was, blister, steel, made, by, the, cementation, process, the, supply, of, cheaper, iron, and, steel, aided, a, number, of, industries, such, as, those, making, nails, hinges, wire, and, other, hardware, items, the, development, of, machine, tools, allowed, better, working, of, iron, causing, it, to, be, increasingly, used, in, the, rapidly, growing, machinery, and, engine, industries, the, development, of, the, stationary, steam, engine, was, an, important, element, of, the, industrial, revolution, however, during, the, early, period, of, the, industrial, revolution, most, industrial, power, was, supplied, by, water, and, wind, in, britain, by, 1800, an, estimated, 10, 000, horsepower, was, being, supplied, by, steam, by, 1815, steam, power, had, grown, to, 210, 000, hp, the, first, commercially, successful, industrial, use, of, steam, power, was, patented, by, thomas, savery, in, 1698, he, constructed, in, london, a, low, lift, combined, vacuum, and, pressure, water, pump, that, generated, about, one, horsepower, hp, and, was, used, in, numerous, waterworks, and, in, a, few, mines, hence, its, brand, name, the, miner, s, friend, savery, s, pump, was, economical, in, small, horsepower, ranges, but, was, prone, to, boiler, explosions, in, larger, sizes, savery, pumps, continued, to, be, produced, until, the, late, 18th, century, the, first, successful, piston, steam, engine, was, introduced, by, thomas, newcomen, before, 1712, newcomen, engines, were, installed, for, draining, hitherto, unworkable, deep, mines, with, the, engine, on, the, surface, these, were, large, machines, requiring, a, significant, amount, of, capital, to, build, and, produced, upwards, of, 3, 5, kw, 5, hp, they, were, also, used, to, power, municipal, water, supply, pumps, they, were, extremely, inefficient, by, modern, standards, but, when, located, where, coal, was, cheap, at, pit, heads, they, opened, up, a, great, expansion, in, coal, mining, by, allowing, mines, to, go, deeper, despite, their, disadvantages, newcomen, engines, were, reliable, and, easy, to, maintain, and, continued, to, be, used, in, the, coalfields, until, the, early, decades, of, the, 19th, century, by, 1729, when, newcomen, died, his, engines, had, spread, to, hungary, in, 1722, and, then, to, germany, austria, and, sweden, a, total, of, 110, are, known, to, have, been, built, by, 1733, when, the, joint, patent, expired, of, which, 14, were, abroad, in, the, 1770s, the, engineer, john, smeaton, built, some, very, large, examples, and, introduced, a, number, of, improvements, a, total, of, 1, 454, engines, had, been, built, by, 1800, a, fundamental, change, in, working, principles, was, brought, about, by, scotsman, james, watt, with, financial, support, from, his, business, partner, englishman, matthew, boulton, he, had, succeeded, by, 1778, in, perfecting, his, steam, engine, which, incorporated, a, series, of, radical, improvements, notably, the, closing, off, of, the, upper, part, of, the, cylinder, thereby, making, the, low, pressure, steam, drive, the, top, of, the, piston, instead, of, the, atmosphere, use, of, a, steam, jacket, and, the, celebrated, separate, steam, condenser, chamber, the, separate, condenser, did, away, with, the, cooling, water, that, had, been, injected, directly, into, the, cylinder, which, cooled, the, cylinder, and, wasted, steam, likewise, the, steam, jacket, kept, steam, from, condensing, in, the, cylinder, also, improving, efficiency, these, improvements, increased, engine, efficiency, so, that, boulton, and, watt, s, engines, used, only, 20, 25, as, much, coal, per, horsepower, hour, as, newcomen, s, boulton, and, watt, opened, the, soho, foundry, for, the, manufacture, of, such, engines, in, 1795, in, 1783, the, watt, steam, engine, had, been, fully, developed, into, a, double, acting, rotative, type, which, meant, that, it, could, be, used, to, directly, drive, the, rotary, machinery, of, a, factory, or, mill, both, of, watt, s, basic, engine, types, were, commercially, very, successful, and, by, 1800, the, firm, boulton, watt, had, constructed, 496, engines, with, 164, driving, reciprocating, pumps, 24, serving, blast, furnaces, and, 308, powering, mill, machinery, most, of, the, engines, generated, from, 3, 5, to, 7, 5, kw, 5, to, 10, hp, until, about, 1800, the, most, common, pattern, of, steam, engine, was, the, beam, engine, built, as, an, integral, part, of, a, stone, or, brick, engine, house, but, soon, various, patterns, of, self, contained, rotative, engines, readily, removable, but, not, on, wheels, were, developed, such, as, the, table, engine, around, the, start, of, the, 19th, century, at, which, time, the, boulton, and, watt, patent, expired, the, cornish, engineer, richard, trevithick, and, the, american, oliver, evans, began, to, construct, higher, pressure, non, condensing, steam, engines, exhausting, against, the, atmosphere, high, pressure, yielded, an, engine, and, boiler, compact, enough, to, be, used, on, mobile, road, and, rail, locomotives, and, steamboats, small, industrial, power, requirements, continued, to, be, provided, by, animal, and, human, muscle, until, widespread, electrification, in, the, early, 20th, century, these, included, crank, powered, treadle, powered, and, horse, powered, workshop, and, light, industrial, machinery, pre, industrial, machinery, was, built, by, various, craftsmen, millwrights, built, watermills, and, windmills, carpenters, made, wooden, framing, and, smiths, and, turners, made, metal, parts, wooden, components, had, the, disadvantage, of, changing, dimensions, with, temperature, and, humidity, and, the, various, joints, tended, to, rack, work, loose, over, time, as, the, industrial, revolution, progressed, machines, with, metal, parts, and, frames, became, more, common, other, important, uses, of, metal, parts, were, in, firearms, and, threaded, fasteners, such, as, machine, screws, bolts, and, nuts, there, was, also, the, need, for, precision, in, making, parts, precision, would, allow, better, working, machinery, interchangeability, of, parts, and, standardization, of, threaded, fasteners, the, demand, for, metal, parts, led, to, the, development, of, several, machine, tools, they, have, their, origins, in, the, tools, developed, in, the, 18th, century, by, makers, of, clocks, and, watches, and, scientific, instrument, makers, to, enable, them, to, batch, produce, small, mechanisms, before, the, advent, of, machine, tools, metal, was, worked, manually, using, the, basic, hand, tools, of, hammers, files, scrapers, saws, and, chisels, consequently, the, use, of, metal, machine, parts, was, kept, to, a, minimum, hand, methods, of, production, were, laborious, and, costly, and, precision, was, difficult, to, achieve, the, first, large, precision, machine, tool, was, the, cylinder, boring, machine, invented, by, john, wilkinson, in, 1774, it, was, designed, to, bore, the, large, cylinders, on, early, steam, engines, wilkinson, s, machine, was, the, first, to, use, the, principle, of, line, boring, where, the, tool, is, supported, on, both, ends, unlike, earlier, designs, used, for, boring, cannon, that, relied, on, a, less, stable, cantilevered, boring, bar, the, planing, machine, the, milling, machine, and, the, shaping, machine, were, developed, in, the, early, decades, of, the, 19th, century, although, the, milling, machine, was, invented, at, this, time, it, was, not, developed, as, a, serious, workshop, tool, until, somewhat, later, in, the, 19th, century, james, fox, of, derby, and, matthew, murray, of, leeds, were, manufacturers, of, machine, tools, who, found, success, in, exporting, from, england, and, are, also, notable, for, having, developed, the, planer, around, the, same, time, as, richard, roberts, of, manchester, henry, maudslay, who, trained, a, school, of, machine, tool, makers, early, in, the, 19th, century, was, a, mechanic, with, superior, ability, who, had, been, employed, at, the, royal, arsenal, woolwich, he, worked, as, an, apprentice, at, the, royal, arsenal, under, jan, verbruggen, in, 1774, verbruggen, had, installed, a, horizontal, boring, machine, which, was, the, first, industrial, size, lathe, in, the, uk, maudslay, was, hired, away, by, joseph, bramah, for, the, production, of, high, security, metal, locks, that, required, precision, craftsmanship, bramah, patented, a, lathe, that, had, similarities, to, the, slide, rest, lathe, 392, 395, maudslay, perfected, the, slide, rest, lathe, which, could, cut, machine, screws, of, different, thread, pitches, by, using, changeable, gears, between, the, spindle, and, the, lead, screw, before, its, invention, screws, could, not, be, cut, to, any, precision, using, various, earlier, lathe, designs, some, of, which, copied, from, a, template, 392, 395, the, slide, rest, lathe, was, called, one, of, history, s, most, important, inventions, although, it, was, not, entirely, maudslay, s, idea, he, was, the, first, person, to, build, a, functional, lathe, using, a, combination, of, known, innovations, of, the, lead, screw, slide, rest, and, change, gears, 31, 36, maudslay, left, bramah, s, employment, and, set, up, his, own, shop, he, was, engaged, to, build, the, machinery, for, making, ships, pulley, blocks, for, the, royal, navy, in, the, portsmouth, block, mills, these, machines, were, all, metal, and, were, the, first, machines, for, mass, production, and, making, components, with, a, degree, of, interchangeability, the, lessons, maudslay, learned, about, the, need, for, stability, and, precision, he, adapted, to, the, development, of, machine, tools, and, in, his, workshops, he, trained, a, generation, of, men, to, build, on, his, work, such, as, richard, roberts, joseph, clement, and, joseph, whitworth, the, techniques, to, make, mass, produced, metal, parts, of, sufficient, precision, to, be, interchangeable, is, largely, attributed, to, a, program, of, the, u, s, department, of, war, which, perfected, interchangeable, parts, for, firearms, in, the, early, 19th, century, in, the, half, century, following, the, invention, of, the, fundamental, machine, tools, the, machine, industry, became, the, largest, industrial, sector, of, the, u, s, economy, by, value, added, the, large, scale, production, of, chemicals, was, an, important, development, during, the, industrial, revolution, the, first, of, these, was, the, production, of, sulphuric, acid, by, the, lead, chamber, process, invented, by, the, englishman, john, roebuck, james, watt, s, first, partner, in, 1746, he, was, able, to, greatly, increase, the, scale, of, the, manufacture, by, replacing, the, relatively, expensive, glass, vessels, formerly, used, with, larger, less, expensive, chambers, made, of, riveted, sheets, of, lead, instead, of, making, a, small, amount, each, time, he, was, able, to, make, around, 50, kilograms, 100, pounds, in, each, of, the, chambers, at, least, a, tenfold, increase, the, production, of, an, alkali, on, a, large, scale, became, an, important, goal, as, well, and, nicolas, leblanc, succeeded, in, 1791, in, introducing, a, method, for, the, production, of, sodium, carbonate, soda, ash, the, leblanc, process, was, a, reaction, of, sulfuric, acid, with, sodium, chloride, to, give, sodium, sulfate, and, hydrochloric, acid, the, sodium, sulfate, was, heated, with, calcium, carbonate, and, coal, to, give, a, mixture, of, sodium, carbonate, and, calcium, sulfide, adding, water, separated, the, soluble, sodium, carbonate, from, the, calcium, sulfide, the, process, produced, a, large, amount, of, pollution, the, hydrochloric, acid, was, initially, vented, to, the, atmosphere, and, calcium, sulfide, was, a, waste, product, nonetheless, this, synthetic, soda, ash, proved, economical, compared, to, that, produced, from, burning, specific, plants, barilla, or, kelp, which, were, the, previously, dominant, sources, of, soda, ash, and, also, to, potash, potassium, carbonate, produced, from, hardwood, ashes, these, two, chemicals, were, very, important, because, they, enabled, the, introduction, of, a, host, of, other, inventions, replacing, many, small, scale, operations, with, more, cost, effective, and, controllable, processes, sodium, carbonate, had, many, uses, in, the, glass, textile, soap, and, paper, industries, early, uses, for, sulfuric, acid, included, pickling, removing, rust, from, iron, and, steel, and, for, bleaching, cloth, the, development, of, bleaching, powder, calcium, hypochlorite, by, scottish, chemist, charles, tennant, in, about, 1800, based, on, the, discoveries, of, french, chemist, claude, louis, berthollet, revolutionised, the, bleaching, processes, in, the, textile, industry, by, dramatically, reducing, the, time, required, from, months, to, days, for, the, traditional, process, then, in, use, which, required, repeated, exposure, to, the, sun, in, bleach, fields, after, soaking, the, textiles, with, alkali, or, sour, milk, tennant, s, factory, at, st, rollox, glasgow, became, the, largest, chemical, plant, in, the, world, after, 1860, the, focus, on, chemical, innovation, was, in, dyestuffs, and, germany, took, world, leadership, building, a, strong, chemical, industry, aspiring, chemists, flocked, to, german, universities, in, the, 1860, 1914, era, to, learn, the, latest, techniques, british, scientists, by, contrast, lacked, research, universities, and, did, not, train, advanced, students, instead, the, practice, was, to, hire, german, trained, chemists, in, 1824, joseph, aspdin, a, british, bricklayer, turned, builder, patented, a, chemical, process, for, making, portland, cement, which, was, an, important, advance, in, the, building, trades, this, process, involves, sintering, a, mixture, of, clay, and, limestone, to, about, 1, 400, c, 2, 552, f, then, grinding, it, into, a, fine, powder, which, is, then, mixed, with, water, sand, and, gravel, to, produce, concrete, portland, cement, concrete, was, used, by, the, english, engineer, marc, isambard, brunel, several, years, later, when, constructing, the, thames, tunnel, concrete, was, used, on, a, large, scale, in, the, construction, of, the, london, sewer, system, a, generation, later, though, others, made, a, similar, innovation, elsewhere, the, large, scale, introduction, of, gas, lighting, was, the, work, of, william, murdoch, an, employee, of, boulton, watt, the, process, consisted, of, the, large, scale, gasification, of, coal, in, furnaces, the, purification, of, the, gas, removal, of, sulphur, ammonia, and, heavy, hydrocarbons, and, its, storage, and, distribution, the, first, gas, lighting, utilities, were, established, in, london, between, 1812, and, 1820, they, soon, became, one, of, the, major, consumers, of, coal, in, the, uk, gas, lighting, affected, social, and, industrial, organisation, because, it, allowed, factories, and, stores, to, remain, open, longer, than, with, tallow, candles, or, oil, lamps, its, introduction, allowed, nightlife, to, flourish, in, cities, and, towns, as, interiors, and, streets, could, be, lighted, on, a, larger, scale, than, before, glass, was, made, in, ancient, greece, and, rome, a, new, method, of, glass, production, known, as, the, cylinder, process, was, developed, in, europe, during, the, early, 19th, century, in, 1832, this, process, was, used, by, the, chance, brothers, to, create, sheet, glass, they, became, the, leading, producers, of, window, and, plate, glass, this, advancement, allowed, for, larger, panes, of, glass, to, be, created, without, interruption, thus, freeing, up, the, space, planning, in, interiors, as, well, as, the, fenestration, of, buildings, the, crystal, palace, is, the, supreme, example, of, the, use, of, sheet, glass, in, a, new, and, innovative, structure, a, machine, for, making, a, continuous, sheet, of, paper, on, a, loop, of, wire, fabric, was, patented, in, 1798, by, louis, nicolas, robert, in, france, the, paper, machine, is, known, as, a, fourdrinier, after, the, financiers, brothers, sealy, and, henry, fourdrinier, who, were, stationers, in, london, although, greatly, improved, and, with, many, variations, the, fourdrinier, machine, is, the, predominant, means, of, paper, production, today, the, method, of, continuous, production, demonstrated, by, the, paper, machine, influenced, the, development, of, continuous, rolling, of, iron, and, later, steel, and, other, continuous, production, processes, the, british, agricultural, revolution, is, considered, one, of, the, causes, of, the, industrial, revolution, because, improved, agricultural, productivity, freed, up, workers, to, work, in, other, sectors, of, the, economy, in, contrast, per, capita, food, supply, in, europe, was, stagnant, or, declining, and, did, not, improve, in, some, parts, of, europe, until, the, late, 18th, century, the, english, lawyer, jethro, tull, invented, an, improved, seed, drill, in, 1701, it, was, a, mechanical, seeder, that, distributed, seeds, evenly, across, a, plot, of, land, and, planted, them, at, the, correct, depth, this, was, important, because, the, yield, of, seeds, harvested, to, seeds, planted, at, that, time, was, around, four, or, five, tull, s, seed, drill, was, very, expensive, and, not, very, reliable, and, therefore, did, not, have, much, of, an, effect, good, quality, seed, drills, were, not, produced, until, the, mid, 18th, century, 26, joseph, foljambe, s, rotherham, plough, of, 1730, was, the, first, commercially, successful, iron, plough, 122, 18, 21, the, threshing, machine, invented, by, the, scottish, engineer, andrew, meikle, in, 1784, displaced, hand, threshing, with, a, flail, a, laborious, job, that, took, about, one, quarter, of, agricultural, labour, 286, lower, labor, requirements, subsequently, result, in, lowered, wages, and, numbers, of, farm, labourers, who, faced, near, starvation, leading, to, the, 1830, agricultural, rebellion, of, the, swing, riots, machine, tools, and, metalworking, techniques, developed, during, the, industrial, revolution, eventually, resulted, in, precision, manufacturing, techniques, in, the, late, 19th, century, for, mass, producing, agricultural, equipment, such, as, reapers, binders, and, combine, harvesters, coal, mining, in, britain, particularly, in, south, wales, started, early, before, the, steam, engine, pits, were, often, shallow, bell, pits, following, a, seam, of, coal, along, the, surface, which, were, abandoned, as, the, coal, was, extracted, in, other, cases, if, the, geology, was, favourable, the, coal, was, mined, by, means, of, an, adit, or, drift, mine, driven, into, the, side, of, a, hill, shaft, mining, was, done, in, some, areas, but, the, limiting, factor, was, the, problem, of, removing, water, it, could, be, done, by, hauling, buckets, of, water, up, the, shaft, or, to, a, sough, a, tunnel, driven, into, a, hill, to, drain, a, mine, in, either, case, the, water, had, to, be, discharged, into, a, stream, or, ditch, at, a, level, where, it, could, flow, away, by, gravity, the, introduction, of, the, steam, pump, by, thomas, savery, in, 1698, and, the, newcomen, steam, engine, in, 1712, greatly, facilitated, the, removal, of, water, and, enabled, shafts, to, be, made, deeper, enabling, more, coal, to, be, extracted, these, were, developments, that, had, begun, before, the, industrial, revolution, but, the, adoption, of, john, smeaton, s, improvements, to, the, newcomen, engine, followed, by, james, watt, s, more, efficient, steam, engines, from, the, 1770s, reduced, the, fuel, costs, of, engines, making, mines, more, profitable, the, cornish, engine, developed, in, the, 1810s, was, much, more, efficient, than, the, watt, steam, engine, coal, mining, was, very, dangerous, owing, to, the, presence, of, firedamp, in, many, coal, seams, some, degree, of, safety, was, provided, by, the, safety, lamp, which, was, invented, in, 1816, by, sir, humphry, davy, and, independently, by, george, stephenson, however, the, lamps, proved, a, false, dawn, because, they, became, unsafe, very, quickly, and, provided, a, weak, light, firedamp, explosions, continued, often, setting, off, coal, dust, explosions, so, casualties, grew, during, the, entire, 19th, century, conditions, of, work, were, very, poor, with, a, high, casualty, rate, from, rock, falls, at, the, beginning, of, the, industrial, revolution, inland, transport, was, by, navigable, rivers, and, roads, with, coastal, vessels, employed, to, move, heavy, goods, by, sea, wagonways, were, used, for, conveying, coal, to, rivers, for, further, shipment, but, canals, had, not, yet, been, widely, constructed, animals, supplied, all, of, the, motive, power, on, land, with, sails, providing, the, motive, power, on, the, sea, the, first, horse, railways, were, introduced, toward, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, with, steam, locomotives, being, introduced, in, the, early, decades, of, the, 19th, century, improving, sailing, technologies, boosted, average, sailing, speed, by, 50, between, 1750, and, 1830, the, industrial, revolution, improved, britain, s, transport, infrastructure, with, a, turnpike, road, network, a, canal, and, waterway, network, and, a, railway, network, raw, materials, and, finished, products, could, be, moved, more, quickly, and, cheaply, than, before, improved, transportation, also, allowed, new, ideas, to, spread, quickly, before, and, during, the, industrial, revolution, navigation, on, several, british, rivers, was, improved, by, removing, obstructions, straightening, curves, widening, and, deepening, and, building, navigation, locks, britain, had, over, 1, 600, kilometres, 1, 000, mi, of, navigable, rivers, and, streams, by, 1750, 46, canals, and, waterways, allowed, bulk, materials, to, be, economically, transported, long, distances, inland, this, was, because, a, horse, could, pull, a, barge, with, a, load, dozens, of, times, larger, than, the, load, that, could, be, drawn, in, a, cart, canals, began, to, be, built, in, the, uk, in, the, late, 18th, century, to, link, the, major, manufacturing, centres, across, the, country, known, for, its, huge, commercial, success, the, bridgewater, canal, in, north, west, england, which, opened, in, 1761, and, was, mostly, funded, by, the, 3rd, duke, of, bridgewater, from, worsley, to, the, rapidly, growing, town, of, manchester, its, construction, cost, 168, 000, 22, 589, 130, as, of, 2013, but, its, advantages, over, land, and, river, transport, meant, that, within, a, year, of, its, opening, in, 1761, the, price, of, coal, in, manchester, fell, by, about, half, this, success, helped, inspire, a, period, of, intense, canal, building, known, as, canal, mania, canals, were, hastily, built, with, the, aim, of, replicating, the, commercial, success, of, the, bridgewater, canal, the, most, notable, being, the, leeds, and, liverpool, canal, and, the, thames, and, severn, canal, which, opened, in, 1774, and, 1789, respectively, by, the, 1820s, a, national, network, was, in, existence, canal, construction, served, as, a, model, for, the, organisation, and, methods, later, used, to, construct, the, railways, they, were, eventually, largely, superseded, as, profitable, commercial, enterprises, by, the, spread, of, the, railways, from, the, 1840s, on, the, last, major, canal, to, be, built, in, the, united, kingdom, was, the, manchester, ship, canal, which, upon, opening, in, 1894, was, the, largest, ship, canal, in, the, world, and, opened, manchester, as, a, port, however, it, never, achieved, the, commercial, success, its, sponsors, had, hoped, for, and, signalled, canals, as, a, dying, mode, of, transport, in, an, age, dominated, by, railways, which, were, quicker, and, often, cheaper, britain, s, canal, network, together, with, its, surviving, mill, buildings, is, one, of, the, most, enduring, features, of, the, early, industrial, revolution, to, be, seen, in, britain, france, was, known, for, having, an, excellent, system, of, roads, at, the, time, of, the, industrial, revolution, however, most, of, the, roads, on, the, european, continent, and, in, the, uk, were, in, bad, condition, and, dangerously, rutted, much, of, the, original, british, road, system, was, poorly, maintained, by, thousands, of, local, parishes, but, from, the, 1720s, and, occasionally, earlier, turnpike, trusts, were, set, up, to, charge, tolls, and, maintain, some, roads, increasing, numbers, of, main, roads, were, turnpiked, from, the, 1750s, to, the, extent, that, almost, every, main, road, in, england, and, wales, was, the, responsibility, of, a, turnpike, trust, new, engineered, roads, were, built, by, john, metcalf, thomas, telford, and, most, notably, john, mcadam, with, the, first, macadam, stretch, of, road, being, marsh, road, at, ashton, gate, bristol, in, 1816, the, first, macadam, road, in, the, u, s, was, the, boonsborough, turnpike, road, between, hagerstown, and, boonsboro, maryland, in, 1823, the, major, turnpikes, radiated, from, london, and, were, the, means, by, which, the, royal, mail, was, able, to, reach, the, rest, of, the, country, heavy, goods, transport, on, these, roads, was, by, means, of, slow, broad, wheeled, carts, hauled, by, teams, of, horses, lighter, goods, were, conveyed, by, smaller, carts, or, by, teams, of, packhorse, stagecoaches, carried, the, rich, and, the, less, wealthy, could, pay, to, ride, on, carriers, carts, productivity, of, road, transport, increased, greatly, during, the, industrial, revolution, and, the, cost, of, travel, fell, dramatically, between, 1690, and, 1840, productivity, almost, tripled, for, long, distance, carrying, and, increased, four, fold, in, stage, coaching, railways, were, made, practical, by, the, widespread, introduction, of, inexpensive, puddled, iron, after, 1800, the, rolling, mill, for, making, rails, and, the, development, of, the, high, pressure, steam, engine, also, around, 1800, reducing, friction, was, one, of, the, major, reasons, for, the, success, of, railroads, compared, to, wagons, this, was, demonstrated, on, an, iron, plate, covered, wooden, tramway, in, 1805, at, croydon, england, a, good, horse, on, an, ordinary, turnpike, road, can, draw, two, thousand, pounds, or, one, ton, a, party, of, gentlemen, were, invited, to, witness, the, experiment, that, the, superiority, of, the, new, road, might, be, established, by, ocular, demonstration, twelve, wagons, were, loaded, with, stones, till, each, wagon, weighed, three, tons, and, the, wagons, were, fastened, together, a, horse, was, then, attached, which, drew, the, wagons, with, ease, six, miles, in, two, hours, having, stopped, four, times, in, order, to, show, he, had, the, power, of, starting, as, well, as, drawing, his, great, load, wagonways, for, moving, coal, in, the, mining, areas, had, started, in, the, 17th, century, and, were, often, associated, with, canal, or, river, systems, for, the, further, movement, of, coal, these, were, all, horse, drawn, or, relied, on, gravity, with, a, stationary, steam, engine, to, haul, the, wagons, back, to, the, top, of, the, incline, the, first, applications, of, the, steam, locomotive, were, on, wagon, or, plate, ways, as, they, were, then, often, called, from, the, cast, iron, plates, used, horse, drawn, public, railways, begin, in, the, early, 19th, century, when, improvements, to, pig, and, wrought, iron, production, were, lowering, costs, steam, locomotives, began, being, built, after, the, introduction, of, high, pressure, steam, engines, after, the, expiration, of, the, boulton, and, watt, patent, in, 1800, high, pressure, engines, exhausted, used, steam, to, the, atmosphere, doing, away, with, the, condenser, and, cooling, water, they, were, also, much, lighter, weight, and, smaller, in, size, for, a, given, horsepower, than, the, stationary, condensing, engines, a, few, of, these, early, locomotives, were, used, in, mines, steam, hauled, public, railways, began, with, the, stockton, and, darlington, railway, in, 1825, the, rapid, introduction, of, railways, followed, the, 1829, rainhill, trials, which, demonstrated, robert, stephenson, s, successful, locomotive, design, and, the, 1828, development, of, hot, blast, which, dramatically, reduced, the, fuel, consumption, of, making, iron, and, increased, the, capacity, of, the, blast, furnace, on, 15, september, 1830, the, liverpool, and, manchester, railway, the, first, inter, city, railway, in, the, world, was, opened, and, was, attended, by, prime, minister, arthur, wellesley, the, railway, was, engineered, by, joseph, locke, and, george, stephenson, linked, the, rapidly, expanding, industrial, town, of, manchester, with, the, port, town, of, liverpool, the, opening, was, marred, by, problems, caused, by, the, primitive, nature, of, the, technology, being, employed, however, problems, were, gradually, solved, and, the, railway, became, highly, successful, transporting, passengers, and, freight, the, success, of, the, inter, city, railway, particularly, in, the, transport, of, freight, and, commodities, led, to, railway, mania, construction, of, major, railways, connecting, the, larger, cities, and, towns, began, in, the, 1830s, but, only, gained, momentum, at, the, very, end, of, the, first, industrial, revolution, after, many, of, the, workers, had, completed, the, railways, they, did, not, return, to, their, rural, lifestyles, but, instead, remained, in, the, cities, providing, additional, workers, for, the, factories, on, a, structural, level, the, industrial, revolution, asked, society, the, so, called, social, question, demanding, new, ideas, for, managing, large, groups, of, individuals, visible, poverty, on, one, hand, and, growing, population, and, materialistic, wealth, on, the, other, caused, tensions, between, the, very, rich, and, the, poorest, people, within, society, these, tensions, were, sometimes, violently, released, and, led, to, philosophical, ideas, such, as, socialism, communism, and, anarchism, prior, to, the, industrial, revolution, most, of, the, workforce, was, employed, in, agriculture, either, as, self, employed, farmers, as, landowners, or, tenants, or, as, landless, agricultural, labourers, it, was, common, for, families, in, various, parts, of, the, world, to, spin, yarn, weave, cloth, and, make, their, own, clothing, households, also, spun, and, wove, for, market, production, at, the, beginning, of, the, industrial, revolution, india, china, and, regions, of, iraq, and, elsewhere, in, asia, and, the, middle, east, produced, most, of, the, world, s, cotton, cloth, while, europeans, produced, wool, and, linen, goods, in, great, britain, in, the, 16th, century, the, putting, out, system, was, practised, by, which, farmers, and, townspeople, produced, goods, for, a, market, in, their, homes, often, described, as, cottage, industry, typical, putting, out, system, goods, included, spinning, and, weaving, merchant, capitalists, typically, provided, the, raw, materials, paid, workers, by, the, piece, and, were, responsible, for, the, sale, of, the, goods, embezzlement, of, supplies, by, workers, and, poor, quality, were, common, problems, the, logistical, effort, in, procuring, and, distributing, raw, materials, and, picking, up, finished, goods, were, also, limitations, of, the, putting, out, system, 57, 59, some, early, spinning, and, weaving, machinery, such, as, a, 40, spindle, jenny, for, about, six, pounds, in, 1792, was, affordable, for, cottagers, 59, later, machinery, such, as, spinning, frames, spinning, mules, and, power, looms, were, expensive, especially, if, water, powered, giving, rise, to, capitalist, ownership, of, factories, the, majority, of, textile, factory, workers, during, the, industrial, revolution, were, unmarried, women, and, children, including, many, orphans, they, typically, worked, for, 12, to, 14, hours, per, day, with, only, sundays, off, it, was, common, for, women, to, take, factory, jobs, seasonally, during, slack, periods, of, farm, work, lack, of, adequate, transportation, long, hours, and, poor, pay, made, it, difficult, to, recruit, and, maintain, workers, the, change, in, the, social, relationship, of, the, factory, worker, compared, to, farmers, and, cottagers, was, viewed, unfavourably, by, karl, marx, however, he, recognized, the, increase, in, productivity, made, possible, by, technology, some, economists, such, as, robert, lucas, jr, say, that, the, real, effect, of, the, industrial, revolution, was, that, for, the, first, time, in, history, the, living, standards, of, the, masses, of, ordinary, people, have, begun, to, undergo, sustained, growth, nothing, remotely, like, this, economic, behaviour, is, mentioned, by, the, classical, economists, even, as, a, theoretical, possibility, others, argue, that, while, the, growth, of, the, economy, s, overall, productive, powers, was, unprecedented, during, the, industrial, revolution, living, standards, for, the, majority, of, the, population, did, not, grow, meaningfully, until, the, late, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, and, that, in, many, ways, workers, living, standards, declined, under, early, capitalism, some, studies, have, estimated, that, real, wages, in, britain, only, increased, 15, between, the, 1780s, and, 1850s, and, that, life, expectancy, in, britain, did, not, begin, to, dramatically, increase, until, the, 1870s, the, average, height, of, the, population, declined, during, the, industrial, revolution, implying, that, their, nutritional, status, was, also, decreasing, during, the, industrial, revolution, the, life, expectancy, of, children, increased, dramatically, the, percentage, of, the, children, born, in, london, who, died, before, the, age, of, five, decreased, from, 74, 5, in, 1730, 1749, to, 31, 8, in, 1810, 1829, the, effects, on, living, conditions, have, been, controversial, and, were, hotly, debated, by, economic, and, social, historians, from, the, 1950s, to, the, 1980s, over, the, course, of, the, period, from, 1813, to, 1913, there, was, a, significant, increase, in, worker, wages, chronic, hunger, and, malnutrition, were, the, norms, for, the, majority, of, the, population, of, the, world, including, britain, and, france, until, the, late, 19th, century, until, about, 1750, malnutrition, limited, life, expectancy, in, france, to, about, 35, years, and, about, 40, years, in, britain, the, united, states, population, of, the, time, was, adequately, fed, much, taller, on, average, and, had, a, life, expectancy, of, 45, 50, years, although, u, s, life, expectancy, declined, by, a, few, years, by, the, mid, 19th, century, food, consumption, per, capita, also, declined, during, an, episode, known, as, the, antebellum, puzzle, food, supply, in, great, britain, was, adversely, affected, by, the, corn, laws, 1815, 1846, which, imposed, tariffs, on, imported, grain, the, laws, were, enacted, to, keep, prices, high, in, order, to, benefit, domestic, producers, the, corn, laws, were, repealed, in, the, early, years, of, the, great, irish, famine, the, initial, technologies, of, the, industrial, revolution, such, as, mechanized, textiles, iron, and, coal, did, little, if, anything, to, lower, food, prices, in, britain, and, the, netherlands, food, supply, increased, before, the, industrial, revolution, with, better, agricultural, practices, however, population, grew, as, well, the, rapid, population, growth, in, the, 19th, century, included, the, new, industrial, and, manufacturing, cities, as, well, as, service, centers, such, as, edinburgh, and, london, the, critical, factor, was, financing, which, was, handled, by, building, societies, that, dealt, directly, with, large, contracting, firms, private, renting, from, housing, landlords, was, the, dominant, tenure, p, kemp, says, this, was, usually, of, advantage, to, tenants, people, moved, in, so, rapidly, there, was, not, enough, capital, to, build, adequate, housing, for, everyone, so, low, income, newcomers, squeezed, into, increasingly, overcrowded, slums, clean, water, sanitation, and, public, health, facilities, were, inadequate, the, death, rate, was, high, especially, infant, mortality, and, tuberculosis, among, young, adults, cholera, from, polluted, water, and, typhoid, were, endemic, unlike, rural, areas, there, were, no, famines, such, as, the, one, that, devastated, ireland, in, the, 1840s, a, large, expos, literature, grew, up, condemning, the, unhealthy, conditions, by, far, the, most, famous, publication, was, by, one, of, the, founders, of, the, socialist, movement, the, condition, of, the, working, class, in, england, in, 1844, friedrich, engels, describes, backstreet, sections, of, manchester, and, other, mill, towns, where, people, lived, in, crude, shanties, and, shacks, some, not, completely, enclosed, some, with, dirt, floors, these, shanty, towns, had, narrow, walkways, between, irregularly, shaped, lots, and, dwellings, there, were, no, sanitary, facilities, the, population, density, was, extremely, high, however, not, everyone, lived, in, such, poor, conditions, the, industrial, revolution, also, created, a, middle, class, of, businessmen, clerks, foremen, and, engineers, who, lived, in, much, better, conditions, conditions, improved, over, the, course, of, the, 19th, century, with, new, public, health, acts, regulating, things, such, as, sewage, hygiene, and, home, construction, in, the, introduction, of, his, 1892, edition, engels, notes, that, most, of, the, conditions, he, wrote, about, in, 1844, had, been, greatly, improved, for, example, the, public, health, act, 1875, 38, 39, vict, c, 55, led, to, the, more, sanitary, byelaw, terraced, house, pre, industrial, water, supply, relied, on, gravity, systems, and, pumping, of, water, was, done, by, water, wheels, pipes, were, typically, made, of, wood, steam, powered, pumps, and, iron, pipes, allowed, the, widespread, piping, of, water, to, horse, watering, troughs, and, households, engels, book, describes, how, untreated, sewage, created, awful, odours, and, turned, the, rivers, green, in, industrial, cities, in, 1854, john, snow, traced, a, cholera, outbreak, in, soho, in, london, to, fecal, contamination, of, a, public, water, well, by, a, home, cesspit, snow, s, findings, that, cholera, could, be, spread, by, contaminated, water, took, some, years, to, be, accepted, but, his, work, led, to, fundamental, changes, in, the, design, of, public, water, and, waste, systems, in, the, 18th, century, there, were, relatively, high, levels, of, literacy, among, farmers, in, england, and, scotland, this, permitted, the, recruitment, of, literate, craftsmen, skilled, workers, foremen, and, managers, who, supervised, the, emerging, textile, factories, and, coal, mines, much, of, the, labour, was, unskilled, and, especially, in, textile, mills, children, as, young, as, eight, proved, useful, in, handling, chores, and, adding, to, the, family, income, indeed, children, were, taken, out, of, school, to, work, alongside, their, parents, in, the, factories, however, by, the, mid, 19th, century, unskilled, labor, forces, were, common, in, western, europe, and, british, industry, moved, upscale, needing, many, more, engineers, and, skilled, workers, who, could, handle, technical, instructions, and, handle, complex, situations, literacy, was, essential, to, be, hired, a, senior, government, official, told, parliament, in, 1870, the, invention, of, the, paper, machine, and, the, application, of, steam, power, to, the, industrial, processes, of, printing, supported, a, massive, expansion, of, newspaper, and, pamphlet, publishing, which, contributed, to, rising, literacy, and, demands, for, mass, political, participation, consumers, benefited, from, falling, prices, for, clothing, and, household, articles, such, as, cast, iron, cooking, utensils, and, in, the, following, decades, stoves, for, cooking, and, space, heating, coffee, tea, sugar, tobacco, and, chocolate, became, affordable, to, many, in, europe, the, consumer, revolution, in, england, from, the, early, 17th, century, to, the, mid, 18th, century, had, seen, a, marked, increase, in, the, consumption, and, variety, of, luxury, goods, and, products, by, individuals, from, different, economic, and, social, backgrounds, with, improvements, in, transport, and, manufacturing, technology, opportunities, for, buying, and, selling, became, faster, and, more, efficient, than, previous, the, expanding, textile, trade, in, the, north, of, england, meant, the, three, piece, suit, became, affordable, to, the, masses, founded, by, potter, and, retail, entrepreneur, josiah, wedgwood, in, 1759, wedgwood, fine, china, and, porcelain, tableware, was, starting, to, become, a, common, feature, on, dining, tables, rising, prosperity, and, social, mobility, in, the, 18th, century, increased, the, number, of, people, with, disposable, income, for, consumption, and, the, marketing, of, goods, of, which, wedgwood, was, a, pioneer, for, individuals, as, opposed, to, items, for, the, household, started, to, appear, and, the, new, status, of, goods, as, status, symbols, related, to, changes, in, fashion, and, desired, for, aesthetic, appeal, with, the, rapid, growth, of, towns,

workers, now, dined, on, wedgwood, porcelain, consumers, came, to, demand, an, array, of, new, household, goods, and, furnishings, metal, knives, and, forks, for, example, as, well, as, rugs, carpets, mirrors, cooking, ranges, pots, pans, watches, clocks, and, a, dizzying, array, of, furniture, the, age, of, mass, consumption, had, arrived, new, businesses, in, various, industries, appeared, in, towns, and, cities, throughout, britain, confectionery, was, one, such, industry, that, saw, rapid, expansion, according, to, food, historian, polly, russell, chocolate, and, biscuits, became, products, for, the, masses, thanks, to, the, industrial, revolution, and, the, consumers, it, created, by, the, mid, 19th, century, sweet, biscuits, were, an, affordable, indulgence, and, business, was, booming, manufacturers, such, as, huntley, palmers, in, reading, carr, s, of, carlisle, and, mcvitie, s, in, edinburgh, transformed, from, small, family, run, businesses, into, state, of, the, art, operations, in, 1847, fry, s, of, bristol, produced, the, first, chocolate, bar, their, competitor, cadbury, of, birmingham, was, the, first, to, commercialize, the, association, between, confectionery, and, romance, when, they, produced, a, heart, shaped, box, of, chocolates, for, valentine, s, day, in, 1868, the, department, store, became, a, common, feature, in, major, high, streets, across, britain, one, of, the, first, was, opened, in, 1796, by, harding, howell, co, on, pall, mall, in, london, in, the, 1860s, fish, and, chip, shops, emerged, across, the, country, in, order, to, satisfy, the, needs, of, the, growing, industrial, population, in, addition, to, goods, being, sold, in, the, growing, number, of, stores, street, sellers, were, common, in, an,

the, menders, of, broken, chairs, and, furniture, could, be, found, on, street, corners, an, early, soft, drinks, company, r, white, s, lemonade, began, in, 1845, by, selling, drinks, in, london, in, a, wheelbarrow, increased, literacy, rates, industrialisation, and, the, invention, of, the, railway, created, a, new, market, for, cheap, popular, literature, for, the, masses, and, the, ability, for, it, to, be, circulated, on, a, large, scale, penny, dreadfuls, were, created, in, the, 1830s, to, meet, this, demand, the, guardian, described, penny, dreadfuls, as, britain, s, first, taste, of, mass, produced, popular, culture, for, the, young, and, the, victorian, equivalent, of, video, games, by, the, 1860s, and, 1870s, more, than, one, million, boys, periodicals, were, sold, per, week,

revenues, and, the, expansion, of, railroads, his, first, novel, the, pickwick, papers, 1836, became, a, publishing, phenomenon, with, its, unprecedented, success, sparking, numerous, spin, offs, and, merchandise, ranging, from, pickwick, cigars, playing, cards, china, figurines, sam, weller, puzzles, weller, boot, polish, and, joke, books, nicholas, dames, in, the, atlantic, writes, literature,

first, mail, order, business, an, idea, which, would, change, the, nature, of, retail, selling, welsh, flannel, he, created, mail, order, catalogues, with, customers, able, to, order, by, mail, for, the, first, time, this, following, the, uniform, penny, post, in, 1840, and, the, invention, of, the, postage, stamp, penny, black, where, there, was, a, charge, of, one, penny, for, carriage, and, delivery, between, any, two, places, in, the, united, kingdom, irrespective, of, distance, and, the, goods, were, delivered, throughout, the, uk, via, the, newly, created, railway, system, as, the, railway, network, expanded, overseas, so, did, his, business, the, industrial, revolution, was, the, first, period, in, history, during, which, there, was, a, simultaneous, increase, in, both, population, and, per, capita, income, according, to, robert, hughes, in, the, fatal, shore, the, population, of, england, and, wales, which, had, remained, steady, at, six, million, from, 1700, to, 1740, rose, dramatically, after, 1740, the, population, of, england, had, more, than, doubled, from, 8, 3, million, in, 1801, to, 16, 8, million, in, 1850, and, by, 1901, had, nearly, doubled, again, to, 30, 5, million, improved, conditions, led, to, the, population, of, britain, increasing, from, 10, million, to, 30, million, in, the, 19th, century, europe, s, population, increased, from, about, 100, million, in, 1700, to, 400, million, by, 1900, the, growth, of, the, modern, industry, since, the, late, 18th, century, led, to, massive, urbanisation, and, the, rise, of, new, great, cities, first, in, europe, and, then, in, other, regions, as, new, opportunities, brought, huge, numbers, of, migrants, from, rural, communities, into, urban, areas, in, 1800, only, 3, of, the, world, s, population, lived, in, cities, compared, to, nearly, 50, by, the, beginning, of, the, 21st, century, manchester, had, a, population, of, 10, 000, in, 1717, but, by, 1911, it, had, burgeoned, to, 2, 3, million, women, s, historians, have, debated, the, effect, of, the, industrial, revolution, and, capitalism, generally, on, the, status, of, women, taking, a, pessimistic, side, alice, clark, argues, that, when, capitalism, arrived, in, 17th, century, england, it, lowered, the, status, of, women, as, they, lost, much, of, their, economic, importance, clark, argues, that, in, 16th, century, england, women, were, engaged, in, many, aspects, of, industry, and, agriculture, the, home, was, a, central, unit, of, production, and, women, played, a, vital, role, in, running, farms, and, in, some, trades, and, landed, estates, their, useful, economic, roles, gave, them, a, sort, of, equality, with, their, husbands, however, clark, argues, as, capitalism, expanded, in, the, 17th, century, there, was, more, division, of, labour, with, the, husband, taking, paid, labour, jobs, outside, the, home, and, the, wife, was, reduced, to, unpaid, household, work, middle, and, upper, class, women, were, confined, to, an, idle, domestic, existence, supervising, servants, lower, class, women, were, forced, to, take, poorly, paid, jobs, capitalism, therefore, had, a, negative, effect, on, powerful, women, in, a, more, positive, interpretation, ivy, pinchbeck, argues, that, capitalism, created, the, conditions, for, women, s, emancipation, tilly, and, scott, have, emphasised, the, continuity, in, the, status, of, women, finding, three, stages, in, english, history, in, the, pre, industrial, era, production, was, mostly, for, home, use, and, women, produced, much, of, the, needs, of, the, households, the, second, stage, was, the, family, wage, economy, of, early, industrialisation, the, entire, family, depended, on, the, collective, wages, of, its, members, including, husband, wife, and, older, children, the, third, or, modern, stage, is, the, family, consumer, economy, in, which, the, family, is, the, site, of, consumption, and, women, are, employed, in, large, numbers, in, retail, and, clerical, jobs, to, support, rising, standards, of, consumption, ideas, of, thrift, and, hard, work, characterised, middle, class, families, as, the, industrial, revolution, swept, europe, these, values, were, displayed, in, samuel, smiles, book, self, help, in, which, he, states, that, the, misery, of, the, poorer, classes, was, voluntary, and, self, imposed, the, results, of, idleness, thriftlessness, intemperance, and, misconduct, in, terms, of, social, structure, the, industrial, revolution, witnessed, the, triumph, of, a, middle, class, of, industrialists, and, businessmen, over, a, landed, class, of, nobility, and, gentry, ordinary, working, people, found, increased, opportunities, for, employment, in, mills, and, factories, but, these, were, often, under, strict, working, conditions, with, long, hours, of, labour, dominated, by, a, pace, set, by, machines, as, late, as, 1900, most, industrial, workers, in, the, united, states, worked, a, 10, hour, day, 12, hours, in, the, steel, industry, yet, earned, 20, 40, less, than, the, minimum, deemed, necessary, for, a, decent, life, however, most, workers, in, textiles, which, was, by, far, the, leading, industry, in, terms, of, employment, were, women, and, children, for, workers, of, the, labouring, classes, industrial, life, was, a, stony, desert, which, they, had, to, make, habitable, by, their, own, efforts, harsh, working, conditions, were, prevalent, long, before, the, industrial, revolution, took, place, pre, industrial, society, was, very, static, and, often, cruel, child, labour, dirty, living, conditions, and, long, working, hours, were, just, as, prevalent, before, the, industrial, revolution, industrialisation, led, to, the, creation, of, the, factory, the, factory, system, contributed, to, the, growth, of, urban, areas, as, large, numbers, of, workers, migrated, into, the, cities, in, search, of, work, in, the, factories, nowhere, was, this, better, illustrated, than, the, mills, and, associated, industries, of, manchester, nicknamed, cottonopolis, and, the, world, s, first, industrial, city, manchester, experienced, a, six, times, increase, in, its, population, between, 1771, and, 1831, bradford, grew, by, 50, every, ten, years, between, 1811, and, 1851, and, by, 1851, only, 50, of, the, population, of, bradford, were, actually, born, there, in, addition, between, 1815, and, 1939, 20, of, europe, s, population, left, home, pushed, by, poverty, a, rapidly, growing, population, and, the, displacement, of, peasant, farming, and, artisan, manufacturing, they, were, pulled, abroad, by, the, enormous, demand, for, labour, overseas, the, ready, availability, of, land, and, cheap, transportation, still, many, did, not, find, a, satisfactory, life, in, their, new, homes, leading, 7, million, of, them, to, return, to, europe, this, mass, migration, had, large, demographic, effects, in, 1800, less, than, 1, of, the, world, population, consisted, of, overseas, europeans, and, their, descendants, by, 1930, they, represented, 11, the, americas, felt, the, brunt, of, this, huge, emigration, largely, concentrated, in, the, united, states, for, much, of, the, 19th, century, production, was, done, in, small, mills, which, were, typically, water, powered, and, built, to, serve, local, needs, later, each, factory, would, have, its, own, steam, engine, and, a, chimney, to, give, an, efficient, draft, through, its, boiler, in, other, industries, the, transition, to, factory, production, was, not, so, divisive, some, industrialists, tried, to, improve, factory, and, living, conditions, for, their, workers, one, of, the, earliest, such, reformers, was, robert, owen, known, for, his, pioneering, efforts, in, improving, conditions, for, workers, at, the, new, lanark, mills, and, often, regarded, as, one, of, the, key, thinkers, of, the, early, socialist, movement, by, 1746, an, integrated, brass, mill, was, working, at, warmley, near, bristol, raw, material, went, in, at, one, end, was, smelted, into, brass, and, was, turned, into, pans, pins, wire, and, other, goods, housing, was, provided, for, workers, on, site, josiah, wedgwood, and, matthew, boulton, whose, soho, manufactory, was, completed, in, 1766, were, other, prominent, early, industrialists, who, employed, the, factory, system, the, industrial, revolution, led, to, a, population, increase, but, the, chances, of, surviving, childhood, did, not, improve, throughout, the, industrial, revolution, although, infant, mortality, rates, were, reduced, markedly, there, was, still, limited, opportunity, for, education, and, children, were, expected, to, work, employers, could, pay, a, child, less, than, an, adult, even, though, their, productivity, was, comparable, there, was, no, need, for, strength, to, operate, an, industrial, machine, and, since, the, industrial, system, was, new, there, were, no, experienced, adult, labourers, this, made, child, labour, the, labour, of, choice, for, manufacturing, in, the, early, phases, of, the, industrial, revolution, between, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, in, england, and, scotland, in, 1788, two, thirds, of, the, workers, in, 143, water, powered, cotton, mills, were, described, as, children, child, labour, existed, before, the, industrial, revolution, but, with, the, increase, in, population, and, education, it, became, more, visible, many, children, were, forced, to, work, in, relatively, bad, conditions, for, much, lower, pay, than, their, elders, 10, 20, of, an, adult, male, s, wage, reports, were, written, detailing, some, of, the, abuses, particularly, in, the, coal, mines, and, textile, factories, and, these, helped, to, popularise, the, children, s, plight, the, public, outcry, especially, among, the, upper, and, middle, classes, helped, stir, change, in, the, young, workers, welfare, politicians, and, the, government, tried, to, limit, child, labour, by, law, but, factory, owners, resisted, some, felt, that, they, were, aiding, the, poor, by, giving, their, children, money, to, buy, food, to, avoid, starvation, and, others, simply, welcomed, the, cheap, labour, in, 1833, and, 1844, the, first, general, laws, against, child, labour, the, factory, acts, were, passed, in, britain, children, younger, than, nine, were, not, allowed, to, work, children, were, not, permitted, to, work, at, night, and, the, workday, of, youth, under, age, 18, was, limited, to, twelve, hours, factory, inspectors, supervised, the, execution, of, the, law, however, their, scarcity, made, enforcement, difficult, about, ten, years, later, the, employment, of, children, and, women, in, mining, was, forbidden, although, laws, such, as, these, decreased, the, number, of, child, labourers, child, labour, remained, significantly, present, in, europe, and, the, united, states, until, the, 20th, century, the, industrial, revolution, concentrated, labour, into, mills, factories, and, mines, thus, facilitating, the, organisation, of, combinations, or, trade, unions, to, help, advance, the, interests, of, working, people, the, power, of, a, union, could, demand, better, terms, by, withdrawing, all, labour, and, causing, a, consequent, cessation, of, production, employers, had, to, decide, between, giving, in, to, the, union, demands, at, a, cost, to, themselves, or, suffering, the, cost, of, the, lost, production, skilled, workers, were, difficult, to, replace, and, these, were, the, first, groups, to, successfully, advance, their, conditions, through, this, kind, of, bargaining, the, main, method, the, unions, used, to, effect, change, was, strike, action, many, strikes, were, painful, events, for, both, sides, the, unions, and, the, management, in, britain, the, combination, act, 1799, forbade, workers, to, form, any, kind, of, trade, union, until, its, repeal, in, 1824, even, after, this, unions, were, still, severely, restricted, one, british, newspaper, in, 1834, described, unions, as, the, most, dangerous, institutions, that, were, ever, permitted, to, take, root, under, shelter, of, law, in, any, country, in, 1832, the, reform, act, extended, the, vote, in, britain, but, did, not, grant, universal, suffrage, that, year, six, men, from, tolpuddle, in, dorset, founded, the, friendly, society, of, agricultural, labourers, to, protest, against, the, gradual, lowering, of, wages, in, the, 1830s, they, refused, to, work, for, less, than, ten, shillings, per, week, although, by, this, time, wages, had, been, reduced, to, seven, shillings, per, week, and, were, due, to, be, further, reduced, to, six, in, 1834, james, frampton, a, local, landowner, wrote, to, prime, minister, lord, melbourne, to, complain, about, the, union, invoking, an, obscure, law, from, 1797, prohibiting, people, from, swearing, oaths, to, each, other, which, the, members, of, the, friendly, society, had, done, six, men, were, arrested, found, guilty, and, transported, to, australia, they, became, known, as, the, tolpuddle, martyrs, in, the, 1830s, and, 1840s, the, chartist, movement, was, the, first, large, scale, organised, working, class, political, movement, that, campaigned, for, political, equality, and, social, justice, its, charter, of, reforms, received, over, three, million, signatures, but, was, rejected, by, parliament, without, consideration, working, people, also, formed, friendly, societies, and, cooperative, societies, as, mutual, support, groups, against, times, of, economic, hardship, enlightened, industrialists, such, as, robert, owen, supported, these, organisations, to, improve, the, conditions, of, the, working, class, unions, slowly, overcame, the, legal, restrictions, on, the, right, to, strike, in, 1842, a, general, strike, involving, cotton, workers, and, colliers, was, organised, through, the, chartist, movement, which, stopped, production, across, great, britain, eventually, effective, political, organisation, for, working, people, was, achieved, through, the, trades, unions, who, after, the, extensions, of, the, franchise, in, 1867, and, 1885, began, to, support, socialist, political, parties, that, later, merged, to, become, the, british, labour, party, the, rapid, industrialisation, of, the, english, economy, cost, many, craft, workers, their, jobs, the, movement, started, first, with, lace, and, hosiery, workers, near, nottingham, and, spread, to, other, areas, of, the, textile, industry, many, weavers, also, found, themselves, suddenly, unemployed, since, they, could, no, longer, compete, with, machines, which, only, required, relatively, limited, and, unskilled, labour, to, produce, more, cloth, than, a, single, weaver, many, such, unemployed, workers, weavers, and, others, turned, their, animosity, towards, the, machines, that, had, taken, their, jobs, and, began, destroying, factories, and, machinery, these, attackers, became, known, as, luddites, supposedly, followers, of, ned, ludd, a, folklore, figure, the, first, attacks, of, the, luddite, movement, began, in, 1811, the, luddites, rapidly, gained, popularity, and, the, british, government, took, drastic, measures, using, the, militia, or, army, to, protect, industry, those, rioters, who, were, caught, were, tried, and, hanged, or, transported, for, life, unrest, continued, in, other, sectors, as, they, industrialised, such, as, with, agricultural, labourers, in, the, 1830s, when, large, parts, of, southern, britain, were, affected, by, the, captain, swing, disturbances, threshing, machines, were, a, particular, target, and, hayrick, burning, was, a, popular, activity, however, the, riots, led, to, the, first, formation, of, trade, unions, and, further, pressure, for, reform, the, traditional, centres, of, hand, textile, production, such, as, india, parts, of, the, middle, east, and, later, china, could, not, withstand, the, competition, from, machine, made, textiles, which, over, a, period, of, decades, destroyed, the, hand, made, textile, industries, and, left, millions, of, people, without, work, many, of, whom, starved, the, industrial, revolution, generated, an, enormous, and, unprecedented, economic, division, in, the, world, as, measured, by, the, share, of, manufacturing, output, cheap, cotton, textiles, increased, the, demand, for, raw, cotton, previously, it, had, primarily, been, consumed, in, subtropical, regions, where, it, was, grown, with, little, raw, cotton, available, for, export, consequently, prices, of, raw, cotton, rose, british, production, grew, from, 2, million, pounds, in, 1700, to, 5, million, pounds, in, 1781, to, 56, million, in, 1800, the, invention, of, the, cotton, gin, by, american, eli, whitney, in, 1792, was, the, decisive, event, it, allowed, green, seeded, cotton, to, become, profitable, leading, to, the, widespread, growth, of, the, large, slave, plantation, in, the, united, states, brazil, and, the, west, indies, in, 1791, american, cotton, production, was, about, 2, million, pounds, soaring, to, 35, million, by, 1800, half, of, which, was, exported, america, s, cotton, plantations, were, highly, efficient, and, profitable, and, were, able, to, keep, up, with, demand, the, u, s, civil, war, created, a, cotton, famine, that, led, to, increased, production, in, other, areas, of, the, world, including, european, colonies, in, africa, the, origins, of, the, environmental, movement, lay, in, the, response, to, increasing, levels, of, smoke, pollution, in, the, atmosphere, during, the, industrial, revolution, the, emergence, of, great, factories, and, the, concomitant, immense, growth, in, coal, consumption, gave, rise, to, an, unprecedented, level, of, air, pollution, in, industrial, centres, after, 1900, the, large, volume, of, industrial, chemical, discharges, added, to, the, growing, load, of, untreated, human, waste, the, first, large, scale, modern, environmental, laws, came, in, the, form, of, britain, s, alkali, acts, passed, in, 1863, to, regulate, the, deleterious, air, pollution, gaseous, hydrochloric, acid, given, off, by, the, leblanc, process, used, to, produce, soda, ash, an, alkali, inspector, and, four, sub, inspectors, were, appointed, to, curb, this, pollution, the, responsibilities, of, the, inspectorate, were, gradually, expanded, culminating, in, the, alkali, order, 1958, which, placed, all, major, heavy, industries, that, emitted, smoke, grit, dust, and, fumes, under, supervision, the, manufactured, gas, industry, began, in, british, cities, in, 1812, 1820, the, technique, used, produced, highly, toxic, effluent, that, was, dumped, into, sewers, and, rivers, the, gas, companies, were, repeatedly, sued, in, nuisance, lawsuits, they, usually, lost, and, modified, the, worst, practices, the, city, of, london, repeatedly, indicted, gas, companies, in, the, 1820s, for, polluting, the, thames, and, poisoning, its, fish, finally, parliament, wrote, company, charters, to, regulate, toxicity, the, industry, reached, the, u, s, around, 1850, causing, pollution, and, lawsuits, in, industrial, cities, local, experts, and, reformers, especially, after, 1890, took, the, lead, in, identifying, environmental, degradation, and, pollution, and, initiating, grass, roots, movements, to, demand, and, achieve, reforms, typically, the, highest, priority, went, to, water, and, air, pollution, the, coal, smoke, abatement, society, was, formed, in, britain, in, 1898, making, it, one, of, the, oldest, environmental, non, governmental, organisations, it, was, founded, by, artist, william, blake, richmond, frustrated, with, the, pall, cast, by, coal, smoke, although, there, were, earlier, pieces, of, legislation, the, public, health, act, 1875, required, all, furnaces, and, fireplaces, to, consume, their, own, smoke, it, also, provided, for, sanctions, against, factories, that, emitted, large, amounts, of, black, smoke, the, provisions, of, this, law, were, extended, in, 1926, with, the, smoke, abatement, act, to, include, other, emissions, such, as, soot, ash, and, gritty, particles, and, to, empower, local, authorities, to, impose, their, own, regulations, the, industrial, revolution, in, continental, europe, came, later, than, in, great, britain, it, started, in, belgium, and, france, then, spread, to, the, german, states, by, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, in, many, industries, this, involved, the, application, of, technology, developed, in, britain, in, new, places, typically, the, technology, was, purchased, from, britain, or, british, engineers, and, entrepreneurs, moved, abroad, in, search, of, new, opportunities, by, 1809, part, of, the, ruhr, valley, in, westphalia, was, called, miniature, england, because, of, its, similarities, to, the, industrial, areas, of, britain, most, european, governments, provided, state, funding, to, the, new, industries, in, some, cases, such, as, iron, the, different, availability, of, resources, locally, meant, that, only, some, aspects, of, the, british, technology, were, adopted, the, habsburg, realms, which, became, austria, hungary, in, 1867, included, 23, million, inhabitants, in, 1800, growing, to, 36, million, by, 1870, nationally, the, per, capita, rate, of, industrial, growth, averaged, about, 3, between, 1818, and, 1870, however, there, were, strong, regional, differences, the, railway, system, was, built, in, the, 1850, 1873, period, before, they, arrived, transportation, was, very, slow, and, expensive, in, the, alpine, and, bohemian, modern, day, czech, republic, regions, proto, industrialisation, began, by, 1750, and, became, the, center, of, the, first, phases, of, the, industrial, revolution, after, 1800, the, textile, industry, was, the, main, factor, utilising, mechanisation, steam, engines, and, the, factory, system, in, the, czech, lands, the, first, mechanical, loom, followed, in, varnsdorf, in, 1801, with, the, first, steam, engines, appearing, in, bohemia, and, moravia, just, a, few, years, later, the, textile, production, flourished, particularly, in, prague, and, brno, german, br, nn, which, was, considered, the, moravian, manchester, the, czech, lands, especially, bohemia, became, the, centre, of, industrialisation, due, to, its, natural, and, human, resources, the, iron, industry, had, developed, in, the, alpine, regions, after, 1750, with, smaller, centers, in, bohemia, and, moravia, hungary, the, eastern, half, of, the, dual, monarchy, was, heavily, rural, with, little, industry, before, 1870, in, 1791, prague, organised, the, first, world, s, fair, list, of, world, s, fairs, bohemia, modern, day, czech, republic, the, first, industrial, exhibition, was, on, the, occasion, of, the, coronation, of, leopold, ii, as, a, king, of, bohemia, which, took, place, in, clementinum, and, therefore, celebrated, the, considerable, sophistication, of, manufacturing, methods, in, the, czech, lands, during, that, time, period, technological, change, accelerated, industrialisation, and, urbanisation, the, gnp, per, capita, grew, roughly, 1, 76, per, year, from, 1870, to, 1913, that, level, of, growth, compared, very, favourably, to, that, of, other, european, nations, such, as, britain, 1, france, 1, 06, and, germany, 1, 51, however, in, a, comparison, with, germany, and, britain, the, austro, hungarian, economy, as, a, whole, still, lagged, considerably, as, sustained, modernisation, had, begun, much, later, belgium, was, the, second, country, in, which, the, industrial, revolution, took, place, and, the, first, in, continental, europe, wallonia, french, speaking, southern, belgium, took, the, lead, starting, in, the, middle, of, the, 1820s, and, especially, after, belgium, became, an, independent, nation, in, 1830, numerous, works, comprising, coke, blast, furnaces, as, well, as, puddling, and, rolling, mills, were, built, in, the, coal, mining, areas, around, li, ge, and, charleroi, the, leader, was, john, cockerill, a, transplanted, englishman, his, factories, at, seraing, integrated, all, stages, of, production, from, engineering, to, the, supply, of, raw, materials, as, early, as, 1825, wallonia, exemplified, the, radical, evolution, of, industrial, expansion, thanks, to, coal, the, french, word, houille, was, coined, in, wallonia, the, region, geared, up, to, become, the, 2nd, industrial, power, in, the, world, after, britain, but, it, is, also, pointed, out, by, many, researchers, with, its, sillon, industriel, especially, in, the, haine, sambre, and, meuse, valleys, between, the, borinage, and, li, ge, there, was, a, huge, industrial, development, based, on, coal, mining, and, iron, making, philippe, raxhon, wrote, about, the, period, after, 1830, it, was, not, propaganda, but, a, reality, the, walloon, regions, were, becoming, the, second, industrial, power, all, over, the, world, after, britain, the, sole, industrial, centre, outside, the, collieries, and, blast, furnaces, of, walloon, was, the, old, cloth, making, town, of, ghent, professor, michel, de, coster, stated, the, historians, and, the, economists, say, that, belgium, was, the, second, industrial, power, of, the, world, in, proportion, to, its, population, and, its, territory, but, this, rank, is, the, one, of, wallonia, where, the, coal, mines, the, blast, furnaces, the, iron, and, zinc, factories, the, wool, industry, the, glass, industry, the, weapons, industry, were, concentrated, many, of, the, 19th, century, coal, mines, in, wallonia, are, now, protected, as, world, heritage, sites, wallonia, was, also, the, birthplace, of, a, strong, socialist, party, and, strong, trade, unions, in, a, particular, sociological, landscape, at, the, left, the, sillon, industriel, which, runs, from, mons, in, the, west, to, verviers, in, the, east, except, part, of, north, flanders, in, another, period, of, the, industrial, revolution, after, 1920, even, if, belgium, is, the, second, industrial, country, after, britain, the, effect, of, the, industrial, revolution, there, was, very, different, in, breaking, stereotypes, muriel, neven, and, isabelle, devious, say, the, industrial, revolution, changed, a, mainly, rural, society, into, an, urban, one, but, with, a, strong, contrast, between, northern, and, southern, belgium, during, the, middle, ages, and, the, early, modern, period, flanders, was, characterised, by, the, presence, of, large, urban, centres, at, the, beginning, of, the, nineteenth, century, this, region, flanders, with, an, urbanisation, degree, of, more, than, 30, percent, remained, one, of, the, most, urbanised, in, the, world, by, comparison, this, proportion, reached, only, 17, percent, in, wallonia, barely, 10, percent, in, most, west, european, countries, 16, percent, in, france, and, 25, percent, in, britain, nineteenth, century, industrialisation, did, not, affect, the, traditional, urban, infrastructure, except, in, ghent, also, in, wallonia, the, traditional, urban, network, was, largely, unaffected, by, the, industrialisation, process, even, though, the, proportion, of, city, dwellers, rose, from, 17, to, 45, percent, between, 1831, and, 1910, especially, in, the, haine, sambre, and, meuse, valleys, between, the, borinage, and, li, ge, where, there, was, a, huge, industrial, development, based, on, coal, mining, and, iron, making, urbanisation, was, fast, during, these, eighty, years, the, number, of, municipalities, with, more, than, 5, 000, inhabitants, increased, from, only, 21, to, more, than, one, hundred, concentrating, nearly, half, of, the, walloon, population, in, this, region, nevertheless, industrialisation, remained, quite, traditional, in, the, sense, that, it, did, not, lead, to, the, growth, of, modern, and, large, urban, centres, but, to, a, conurbation, of, industrial, villages, and, towns, developed, around, a, coal, mine, or, a, factory, communication, routes, between, these, small, centres, only, became, populated, later, and, created, a, much, less, dense, urban, morphology, than, for, instance, the, area, around, li, ge, where, the, old, town, was, there, to, direct, migratory, flows, the, industrial, revolution, in, france, followed, a, particular, course, as, it, did, not, correspond, to, the, main, model, followed, by, other, countries, notably, most, french, historians, argue, france, did, not, go, through, a, clear, take, off, instead, france, s, economic, growth, and, industrialisation, process, was, slow, and, steady, through, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, however, some, stages, were, identified, by, maurice, l, vy, leboyer, based, on, its, leadership, in, chemical, research, in, the, universities, and, industrial, laboratories, germany, which, was, unified, in, 1871, became, dominant, in, the, world, s, chemical, industry, in, the, late, 19th, century, at, first, the, production, of, dyes, based, on, aniline, was, critical, germany, s, political, disunity, with, three, dozen, states, and, a, pervasive, conservatism, made, it, difficult, to, build, railways, in, the, 1830s, however, by, the, 1840s, trunk, lines, linked, the, major, cities, each, german, state, was, responsible, for, the, lines, within, its, own, borders, lacking, a, technological, base, at, first, the, germans, imported, their, engineering, and, hardware, from, britain, but, quickly, learned, the, skills, needed, to, operate, and, expand, the, railways, in, many, cities, the, new, railway, shops, were, the, centres, of, technological, awareness, and, training, so, that, by, 1850, germany, was, self, sufficient, in, meeting, the, demands, of, railroad, construction, and, the, railways, were, a, major, impetus, for, the, growth, of, the, new, steel, industry, observers, found, that, even, as, late, as, 1890, their, engineering, was, inferior, to, britain, s, however, german, unification, in, 1871, stimulated, consolidation, nationalisation, into, state, owned, companies, and, further, rapid, growth, unlike, the, situation, in, france, the, goal, was, the, support, of, industrialisation, and, so, heavy, lines, crisscrossed, the, ruhr, and, other, industrial, districts, and, provided, good, connections, to, the, major, ports, of, hamburg, and, bremen, by, 1880, germany, had, 9, 400, locomotives, pulling, 43, 000, passengers, and, 30, 000, tons, of, freight, and, pulled, ahead, of, france, during, the, period, 1790, 1815, sweden, experienced, two, parallel, economic, movements, an, agricultural, revolution, with, larger, agricultural, estates, new, crops, and, farming, tools, and, commercialisation, of, farming, and, a, proto, industrialisation, with, small, industries, being, established, in, the, countryside, and, with, workers, switching, between, agricultural, work, in, summer, and, industrial, production, in, winter, this, led, to, economic, growth, benefiting, large, sections, of, the, population, and, leading, up, to, a, consumption, revolution, starting, in, the, 1820s, between, 1815, and, 1850, the, protoindustries, developed, into, more, specialised, and, larger, industries, this, period, witnessed, increasing, regional, specialisation, with, mining, in, bergslagen, textile, mills, in, sjuh, radsbygden, and, forestry, in, norrland, several, important, institutional, changes, took, place, in, this, period, such, as, free, and, mandatory, schooling, introduced, in, 1842, as, the, first, country, in, the, world, the, abolition, of, the, national, monopoly, on, trade, in, handicrafts, in, 1846, and, a, stock, company, law, in, 1848, from, 1850, to, 1890, sweden, experienced, its, first, industrial, revolution, with, a, veritable, explosion, in, export, dominated, by, crops, wood, and, steel, sweden, abolished, most, tariffs, and, other, barriers, to, free, trade, in, the, 1850s, and, joined, the, gold, standard, in, 1873, large, infrastructural, investments, were, made, during, this, period, mainly, in, the, expanding, railroad, network, which, was, financed, in, part, by, the, government, and, in, part, by, private, enterprises, from, 1890, to, 1930, new, industries, developed, with, their, focus, on, the, domestic, market, mechanical, engineering, power, utilities, papermaking, and, textile, the, industrial, revolution, began, about, 1870, as, meiji, period, leaders, decided, to, catch, up, with, the, west, the, government, built, railroads, improved, roads, and, inaugurated, a, land, reform, program, to, prepare, the, country, for, further, development, it, inaugurated, a, new, western, based, education, system, for, all, young, people, sent, thousands, of, students, to, the, united, states, and, europe, and, hired, more, than, 3, 000, westerners, to, teach, modern, science, mathematics, technology, and, foreign, languages, in, japan, foreign, government, advisors, in, meiji, japan, in, 1871, a, group, of, japanese, politicians, known, as, the, iwakura, mission, toured, europe, and, the, united, states, to, learn, western, ways, the, result, was, a, deliberate, state, led, industrialisation, policy, to, enable, japan, to, quickly, catch, up, the, bank, of, japan, founded, in, 1882, used, taxes, to, fund, model, steel, and, textile, factories, education, was, expanded, and, japanese, students, were, sent, to, study, in, the, west, modern, industry, first, appeared, in, textiles, including, cotton, and, especially, silk, which, was, based, in, home, workshops, in, rural, areas, during, the, late, 18th, and, early, 19th, centuries, when, the, uk, and, parts, of, western, europe, began, to, industrialise, the, us, was, primarily, an, agricultural, and, natural, resource, producing, and, processing, economy, the, building, of, roads, and, canals, the, introduction, of, steamboats, and, the, building, of, railroads, were, important, for, handling, agricultural, and, natural, resource, products, in, the, large, and, sparsely, populated, country, of, the, period, important, american, technological, contributions, during, the, period, of, the, industrial, revolution, were, the, cotton, gin, and, the, development, of, a, system, for, making, interchangeable, parts, which, was, aided, by, the, development, of, the, milling, machine, in, the, united, states, the, development, of, machine, tools, and, the, system, of, interchangeable, parts, was, the, basis, for, the, rise, of, the, us, as, the, world, s, leading, industrial, nation, in, the, late, 19th, century, oliver, evans, invented, an, automated, flour, mill, in, the, mid, 1780s, that, used, control, mechanisms, and, conveyors, so, that, no, labour, was, needed, from, the, time, grain, was, loaded, into, the, elevator, buckets, until, the, flour, was, discharged, into, a, wagon, this, is, considered, to, be, the, first, modern, materials, handling, system, an, important, advance, in, the, progress, toward, mass, production, the, united, states, originally, used, horse, powered, machinery, for, small, scale, applications, such, as, grain, milling, but, eventually, switched, to, water, power, after, textile, factories, began, being, built, in, the, 1790s, as, a, result, industrialisation, was, concentrated, in, new, england, and, the, northeastern, united, states, which, has, fast, moving, rivers, the, newer, water, powered, production, lines, proved, more, economical, than, horse, drawn, production, in, the, late, 19th, century, steam, powered, manufacturing, overtook, water, powered, manufacturing, allowing, the, industry, to, spread, to, the, midwest, thomas, somers, and, the, cabot, brothers, founded, the, beverly, cotton, manufactory, in, 1787, the, first, cotton, mill, in, america, the, largest, cotton, mill, of, its, era, and, a, significant, milestone, in, the, research, and, development, of, cotton, mills, in, the, future, this, mill, was, designed, to, use, horsepower, but, the, operators, quickly, learned, that, the, horse, drawn, platform, was, economically, unstable, and, had, economic, losses, for, years, despite, the, losses, the, manufactory, served, as, a, playground, of, innovation, both, in, turning, a, large, amount, of, cotton, but, also, developing, the, water, powered, milling, structure, used, in, slater, s, mill, in, 1793, samuel, slater, 1768, 1835, founded, the, slater, mill, at, pawtucket, rhode, island, he, had, learned, of, the, new, textile, technologies, as, a, boy, apprentice, in, derbyshire, england, and, defied, laws, against, the, emigration, of, skilled, workers, by, leaving, for, new, york, in, 1789, hoping, to, make, money, with, his, knowledge, after, founding, slater, s, mill, he, went, on, to, own, 13, textile, mills, daniel, day, established, a, wool, carding, mill, in, the, blackstone, valley, at, uxbridge, massachusetts, in, 1809, the, third, woollen, mill, established, in, the, us, the, first, was, in, hartford, connecticut, and, the, second, at, watertown, massachusetts, the, john, h, chafee, blackstone, river, valley, national, heritage, corridor, retraces, the, history, of, america, s, hardest, working, river, the, blackstone, the, blackstone, river, and, its, tributaries, which, cover, more, than, 70, kilometres, 45, mi, from, worcester, massachusetts, to, providence, rhode, island, was, the, birthplace, of, america, s, industrial, revolution, at, its, peak, over, 1, 100, mills, operated, in, this, valley, including, slater, s, mill, and, with, it, the, earliest, beginnings, of, america, s, industrial, and, technological, development, merchant, francis, cabot, lowell, from, newburyport, massachusetts, memorised, the, design, of, textile, machines, on, his, tour, of, british, factories, in, 1810, realising, that, the, war, of, 1812, had, ruined, his, import, business, but, that, demand, for, domestic, finished, cloth, was, emerging, in, america, on, his, return, to, the, united, states, he, set, up, the, boston, manufacturing, company, lowell, and, his, partners, built, america, s, second, cotton, to, cloth, textile, mill, at, waltham, massachusetts, second, to, the, beverly, cotton, manufactory, after, his, death, in, 1817, his, associates, built, america, s, first, planned, factory, town, which, they, named, after, him, this, enterprise, was, capitalised, in, a, public, stock, offering, one, of, the, first, uses, of, it, in, the, united, states, lowell, massachusetts, using, nine, kilometres, 5, 1, 2, miles, of, canals, and, 7, 500, kilowatts, 10, 000, horsepower, delivered, by, the, merrimack, river, is, considered, by, some, as, a, major, contributor, to, the, success, of, the, american, industrial, revolution, the, short, lived, utopia, like, waltham, lowell, system, was, formed, as, a, direct, response, to, the, poor, working, conditions, in, britain, however, by, 1850, especially, following, the, great, famine, of, ireland, the, system, had, been, replaced, by, poor, immigrant, labour, a, major, u, s, contribution, to, industrialisation, was, the, development, of, techniques, to, make, interchangeable, parts, from, metal, precision, metal, machining, techniques, were, developed, by, the, u, s, department, of, war, to, make, interchangeable, parts, for, small, firearms, the, development, work, took, place, at, the, federal, arsenals, at, springfield, armory, and, harpers, ferry, armory, techniques, for, precision, machining, using, machine, tools, included, using, fixtures, to, hold, the, parts, in, the, proper, position, jigs, to, guide, the, cutting, tools, and, precision, blocks, and, gauges, to, measure, the, accuracy, the, milling, machine, a, fundamental, machine, tool, is, believed, to, have, been, invented, by, eli, whitney, who, was, a, government, contractor, who, built, firearms, as, part, of, this, program, another, important, invention, was, the, blanchard, lathe, invented, by, thomas, blanchard, the, blanchard, lathe, or, pattern, tracing, lathe, was, actually, a, shaper, that, could, produce, copies, of, wooden, gun, stocks, the, use, of, machinery, and, the, techniques, for, producing, standardised, and, interchangeable, parts, became, known, as, the, american, system, of, manufacturing, precision, manufacturing, techniques, made, it, possible, to, build, machines, that, mechanised, the, shoe, industry, and, the, watch, industry, the, industrialisation, of, the, watch, industry, started, in, 1854, also, in, waltham, massachusetts, at, the, waltham, watch, company, with, the, development, of, machine, tools, gauges, and, assembling, methods, adapted, to, the, micro, precision, required, for, watches, steel, is, often, cited, as, the, first, of, several, new, areas, for, industrial, mass, production, which, are, said, to, characterise, a, second, industrial, revolution, beginning, around, 1850, although, a, method, for, mass, manufacture, of, steel, was, not, invented, until, the, 1860s, when, sir, henry, bessemer, invented, a, new, furnace, which, could, convert, molten, pig, iron, into, steel, in, large, quantities, however, it, only, became, widely, available, in, the, 1870s, after, the, process, was, modified, to, produce, more, uniform, quality, bessemer, steel, was, being, displaced, by, the, open, hearth, furnace, near, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, this, second, industrial, revolution, gradually, grew, to, include, chemicals, mainly, the, chemical, industries, petroleum, refining, and, distribution, and, in, the, 20th, century, the, automotive, industry, and, was, marked, by, a, transition, of, technological, leadership, from, britain, to, the, united, states, and, germany, the, increasing, availability, of, economical, petroleum, products, also, reduced, the, importance, of, coal, and, further, widened, the, potential, for, industrialisation, a, new, revolution, began, with, electricity, and, electrification, in, the, electrical, industries, the, introduction, of, hydroelectric, power, generation, in, the, alps, enabled, the, rapid, industrialisation, of, coal, deprived, northern, italy, beginning, in, the, 1890s, by, the, 1890s, industrialisation, in, these, areas, had, created, the, first, giant, industrial, corporations, with, burgeoning, global, interests, as, companies, like, u, s, steel, general, electric, standard, oil, and, bayer, ag, joined, the, railroad, and, ship, companies, on, the, world, s, stock, markets, the, new, industrialist, movement, advocates, for, increasing, domestic, manufacturing, while, reducing, emphasis, on, a, financial, based, economy, that, relies, on, real, estate, and, trading, speculative, assets, new, industrialism, has, been, described, as, supply, side, progressivism, or, embracing, the, idea, of, building, more, stuff, new, industrialism, developed, after, the, china, shock, that, resulted, in, lost, manufacturing, jobs, in, the, u, s, after, china, joined, the, world, trade, organization, in, 2001, the, movement, strengthened, after, the, reduction, of, manufacturing, jobs, during, the, great, recession, and, when, the, u, s, was, not, able, to, manufacture, enough, tests, or, facemasks, during, the, covid, 19, pandemic, new, industrialism, calls, for, building, enough, housing, to, satisfy, demand, in, order, to, reduce, the, profit, in, land, speculation, to, invest, in, infrastructure, and, to, develop, advanced, technology, to, manufacture, green, energy, for, the, world, new, industrialists, believe, that, the, united, states, is, not, building, enough, productive, capital, and, should, invest, more, into, economic, growth, the, causes, of, the, industrial, revolution, were, complicated, and, remain, a, topic, for, debate, geographic, factors, include, britain, s, vast, mineral, resources, in, addition, to, metal, ores, britain, had, the, highest, quality, coal, reserves, known, at, the, time, as, well, as, abundant, water, power, highly, productive, agriculture, and, numerous, seaports, and, navigable, waterways, some, historians, believe, the, industrial, revolution, was, an, outgrowth, of, social, and, institutional, changes, brought, by, the, end, of, feudalism, in, britain, after, the, english, civil, war, in, the, 17th, century, although, feudalism, began, to, break, down, after, the, black, death, of, the, mid, 14th, century, followed, by, other, epidemics, until, the, population, reached, a, low, in, the, 14th, century, this, created, labour, shortages, and, led, to, falling, food, prices, and, a, peak, in, real, wages, around, 1500, after, which, population, growth, began, reducing, wages, after, 1540, increasing, precious, metals, supply, from, the, americas, caused, coinage, debasement, inflation, which, caused, land, rents, often, long, term, leases, that, transferred, to, heirs, on, death, to, fall, in, real, terms, the, enclosure, movement, and, the, british, agricultural, revolution, made, food, production, more, efficient, and, less, labour, intensive, forcing, the, farmers, who, could, no, longer, be, self, sufficient, in, agriculture, into, cottage, industry, for, example, weaving, and, in, the, longer, term, into, the, cities, and, the, newly, developed, factories, the, colonial, expansion, of, the, 17th, century, with, the, accompanying, development, of, international, trade, creation, of, financial, markets, and, accumulation, of, capital, are, also, cited, as, factors, as, is, the, scientific, revolution, of, the, 17th, century, a, change, in, marrying, patterns, to, getting, married, later, made, people, able, to, accumulate, more, human, capital, during, their, youth, thereby, encouraging, economic, development, until, the, 1980s, it, was, universally, believed, by, academic, historians, that, technological, innovation, was, the, heart, of, the, industrial, revolution, and, the, key, enabling, technology, was, the, invention, and, improvement, of, the, steam, engine, marketing, professor, ronald, fullerton, suggested, that, innovative, marketing, techniques, business, practices, and, competition, also, influenced, changes, in, the, manufacturing, industry, lewis, mumford, has, proposed, that, the, industrial, revolution, had, its, origins, in, the, early, middle, ages, much, earlier, than, most, estimates, he, explains, that, the, model, for, standardised, mass, production, was, the, printing, press, and, that, the, archetypal, model, for, the, industrial, era, was, the, clock, he, also, cites, the, monastic, emphasis, on, order, and, time, keeping, as, well, as, the, fact, that, medieval, cities, had, at, their, centre, a, church, with, bell, ringing, at, regular, intervals, as, being, necessary, precursors, to, a, greater, synchronisation, necessary, for, later, more, physical, manifestations, such, as, the, steam, engine, the, presence, of, a, large, domestic, market, should, also, be, considered, an, important, driver, of, the, industrial, revolution, particularly, explaining, why, it, occurred, in, britain, in, other, nations, such, as, france, markets, were, split, up, by, local, regions, which, often, imposed, tolls, and, tariffs, on, goods, traded, among, them, internal, tariffs, were, abolished, by, henry, viii, of, england, they, survived, in, russia, until, 1753, 1789, in, france, and, 1839, in, spain, governments, grant, of, limited, monopolies, to, inventors, under, a, developing, patent, system, the, statute, of, monopolies, in, 1623, is, considered, an, influential, factor, the, effects, of, patents, both, good, and, ill, on, the, development, of, industrialisation, are, clearly, illustrated, in, the, history, of, the, steam, engine, the, key, enabling, technology, in, return, for, publicly, revealing, the, workings, of, an, invention, the, patent, system, rewarded, inventors, such, as, james, watt, by, allowing, them, to, monopolise, the, production, of, the, first, steam, engines, thereby, rewarding, inventors, and, increasing, the, pace, of, technological, development, however, monopolies, bring, with, them, their, own, inefficiencies, which, may, counterbalance, or, even, overbalance, the, beneficial, effects, of, publicising, ingenuity, and, rewarding, inventors, watt, s, monopoly, prevented, other, inventors, such, as, richard, trevithick, william, murdoch, or, jonathan, hornblower, whom, boulton, and, watt, sued, from, introducing, improved, steam, engines, thereby, retarding, the, spread, of, steam, power, one, question, of, active, interest, to, historians, is, why, the, industrial, revolution, occurred, in, europe, and, not, in, other, parts, of, the, world, in, the, 18th, century, particularly, china, india, and, the, middle, east, which, pioneered, in, shipbuilding, textile, production, water, mills, and, much, more, in, the, period, between, 750, and, 1100, or, at, other, times, like, in, classical, antiquity, or, the, middle, ages, a, recent, account, argued, that, europeans, have, been, characterized, for, thousands, of, years, by, a, freedom, loving, culture, originating, from, the, aristocratic, societies, of, early, indo, european, invaders, many, historians, however, have, challenged, this, explanation, as, being, not, only, eurocentric, but, also, ignoring, historical, context, in, fact, before, the, industrial, revolution, there, existed, something, of, a, global, economic, parity, between, the, most, advanced, regions, in, the, world, economy, these, historians, have, suggested, a, number, of, other, factors, including, education, technological, changes, see, scientific, revolution, in, europe, modern, government, modern, work, attitudes, ecology, and, culture, china, was, the, world, s, most, technologically, advanced, country, for, many, centuries, however, china, stagnated, economically, and, technologically, and, was, surpassed, by, western, europe, before, the, age, of, discovery, by, which, time, china, banned, imports, and, denied, entry, to, foreigners, china, was, also, a, totalitarian, society, it, also, taxed, transported, goods, heavily, modern, estimates, of, per, capita, income, in, western, europe, in, the, late, 18th, century, are, of, roughly, 1, 500, dollars, in, purchasing, power, parity, and, britain, had, a, per, capita, income, of, nearly, 2, 000, dollars, whereas, china, by, comparison, had, only, 450, dollars, india, was, essentially, feudal, politically, fragmented, and, not, as, economically, advanced, as, western, europe, historians, such, as, david, landes, and, sociologists, max, weber, and, rodney, stark, credit, the, different, belief, systems, in, asia, and, europe, with, dictating, where, the, revolution, occurred, the, religion, and, beliefs, of, europe, were, largely, products, of, judaeo, christianity, and, greek, thought, conversely, chinese, society, was, founded, on, men, like, confucius, mencius, han, feizi, legalism, lao, tzu, taoism, and, buddha, buddhism, resulting, in, very, different, worldviews, other, factors, include, the, considerable, distance, of, china, s, coal, deposits, though, large, from, its, cities, as, well, as, the, then, unnavigable, yellow, river, that, connects, these, deposits, to, the, sea, in, contrast, to, china, india, was, split, up, into, many, competing, kingdoms, after, the, decline, of, the, mughal, empire, with, the, major, ones, in, its, aftermath, including, the, marathas, sikhs, bengal, subah, and, kingdom, of, mysore, in, addition, the, economy, was, highly, dependent, on, two, sectors, agriculture, of, subsistence, and, cotton, and, there, appears, to, have, been, little, technical, innovation, it, is, believed, that, the, vast, amounts, of, wealth, were, largely, stored, away, in, palace, treasuries, by, monarchs, prior, to, the, british, take, over, economic, historian, joel, mokyr, argued, that, political, fragmentation, the, presence, of, a, large, number, of, european, states, made, it, possible, for, heterodox, ideas, to, thrive, as, entrepreneurs, innovators, ideologues, and, heretics, could, easily, flee, to, a, neighboring, state, in, the, event, that, the, one, state, would, try, to, suppress, their, ideas, and, activities, this, is, what, set, europe, apart, from, the, technologically, advanced, large, unitary, empires, such, as, china, and, india, by, providing, an, insurance, against, economic, and, technological, stagnation, china, had, both, a, printing, press, and, movable, type, and, india, had, similar, levels, of, scientific, and, technological, achievement, as, europe, in, 1700, yet, the, industrial, revolution, would, occur, in, europe, not, china, or, india, in, europe, political, fragmentation, was, coupled, with, an, integrated, market, for, ideas, where, europe, s, intellectuals, used, the, lingua, franca, of, latin, had, a, shared, intellectual, basis, in, europe, s, classical, heritage, and, the, pan, european, institution, of, the, republic, of, letters, political, institutions, could, contribute, to, the, relation, between, democratization, and, economic, growth, during, great, divergence, in, addition, europe, s, monarchs, desperately, needed, revenue, pushing, them, into, alliances, with, their, merchant, classes, small, groups, of, merchants, were, granted, monopolies, and, tax, collecting, responsibilities, in, exchange, for, payments, to, the, state, located, in, a, region, at, the, hub, of, the, largest, and, most, varied, network, of, exchange, in, history, europe, advanced, as, the, leader, of, the, industrial, revolution, in, the, americas, europeans, found, a, windfall, of, silver, timber, fish, and, maize, leading, historian, peter, stearns, to, conclude, that, europe, s, industrial, revolution, stemmed, in, great, part, from, europe, s, ability, to, draw, disproportionately, on, world, resources, modern, capitalism, originated, in, the, italian, city, states, around, the, end, of, the, first, millennium, the, city, states, were, prosperous, cities, that, were, independent, from, feudal, lords, they, were, largely, republics, whose, governments, were, typically, composed, of, merchants, manufacturers, members, of, guilds, bankers, and, financiers, the, italian, city, states, built, a, network, of, branch, banks, in, leading, western, european, cities, and, introduced, double, entry, bookkeeping, italian, commerce, was, supported, by, schools, that, taught, numeracy, in, financial, calculations, through, abacus, schools, great, britain, provided, the, legal, and, cultural, foundations, that, enabled, entrepreneurs, to, pioneer, the, industrial, revolution, key, factors, fostering, this, environment, were, an, unprecedented, explosion, of, new, ideas, and, new, technological, inventions, transformed, our, use, of, energy, creating, an, increasingly, industrial, and, urbanised, country, roads, railways, and, canals, were, built, great, cities, appeared, scores, of, factories, and, mills, sprang, up, our, landscape, would, never, be, the, same, again, it, was, a, revolution, that, transformed, not, only, the, country, but, the, world, itself, british, historian, jeremy, black, on, the, bbc, s, why, the, industrial, revolution, happened, here, there, were, two, main, values, that, drove, the, industrial, revolution, in, britain, these, values, were, self, interest, and, an, entrepreneurial, spirit, because, of, these, interests, many, industrial, advances, were, made, that, resulted, in, a, huge, increase, in, personal, wealth, and, a, consumer, revolution, these, advancements, also, greatly, benefitted, british, society, as, a, whole, countries, around, the, world, started, to, recognise, the, changes, and, advancements, in, britain, and, use, them, as, an, example, to, begin, their, own, industrial, revolutions, a, debate, sparked, by, trinidadian, politician, and, historian, eric, williams, in, his, work, capitalism, and, slavery, 1944, concerned, the, role, of, slavery, in, financing, the, industrial, revolution, williams, argued, that, european, capital, amassed, from, slavery, was, vital, in, the, early, years, of, the, revolution, contending, that, the, rise, of, industrial, capitalism, was, the, driving, force, behind, abolitionism, instead, of, humanitarian, motivations, these, arguments, led, to, significant, historiographical, debates, among, historians, with, american, historian, seymour, drescher, critiquing, williams, arguments, in, econocide, 1977, instead, the, greater, liberalisation, of, trade, from, a, large, merchant, base, may, have, allowed, britain, to, produce, and, use, emerging, scientific, and, technological, developments, more, effectively, than, countries, with, stronger, monarchies, particularly, china, and, russia, britain, emerged, from, the, napoleonic, wars, as, the, only, european, nation, not, ravaged, by, financial, plunder, and, economic, collapse, and, having, the, only, merchant, fleet, of, any, useful, size, european, merchant, fleets, were, destroyed, during, the, war, by, the, royal, navy, britain, s, extensive, exporting, cottage, industries, also, ensured, markets, were, already, available, for, many, early, forms, of, manufactured, goods, the, conflict, resulted, in, most, british, warfare, being, conducted, overseas, reducing, the, devastating, effects, of, territorial, conquest, that, affected, much, of, europe, this, was, further, aided, by, britain, s, geographical, position, an, island, separated, from, the, rest, of, mainland, europe, another, theory, is, that, britain, was, able, to, succeed, in, the, industrial, revolution, due, to, the, availability, of, key, resources, it, possessed, it, had, a, dense, population, for, its, small, geographical, size, enclosure, of, common, land, and, the, related, agricultural, revolution, made, a, supply, of, this, labour, readily, available, there, was, also, a, local, coincidence, of, natural, resources, in, the, north, of, england, the, english, midlands, south, wales, and, the, scottish, lowlands, local, supplies, of, coal, iron, lead, copper, tin, limestone, and, water, power, resulted, in, excellent, conditions, for, the, development, and, expansion, of, industry, also, the, damp, mild, weather, conditions, of, the, north, west, of, england, provided, ideal, conditions, for, the, spinning, of, cotton, providing, a, natural, starting, point, for, the, birth, of, the, textiles, industry, the, stable, political, situation, in, britain, from, around, 1689, following, the, glorious, revolution, and, british, society, s, greater, receptiveness, to, change, compared, with, other, european, countries, can, also, be, said, to, be, factors, favouring, the, industrial, revolution, peasant, resistance, to, industrialisation, was, largely, eliminated, by, the, enclosure, movement, and, the, landed, upper, classes, developed, commercial, interests, that, made, them, pioneers, in, removing, obstacles, to, the, growth, of, capitalism, this, point, is, also, made, in, hilaire, belloc, s, the, servile, state, the, french, philosopher, voltaire, wrote, about, capitalism, and, religious, tolerance, in, his, book, on, english, society, letters, on, the, english, 1733, noting, why, england, at, that, time, was, more, prosperous, in, comparison, to, the, country, s, less, religiously, tolerant, european, neighbours, take, a, view, of, the, royal, exchange, in, london, a, place, more, venerable, than, many, courts, of, justice, where, the, representatives, of, all, nations, meet, for, the, benefit, of, mankind, there, the, jew, the, mahometan, and, the, christian, transact, together, as, though, they, all, professed, the, same, religion, and, give, the, name, of, infidel, to, none, but, bankrupts, there, the, presbyterian, confides, in, the, anabaptist, and, the, churchman, depends, on, the, quaker, s, word, if, one, religion, only, were, allowed, in, england, the, government, would, very, possibly, become, arbitrary, if, there, were, but, two, the, people, would, cut, one, another, s, throats, but, as, there, are, such, a, multitude, they, all, live, happy, and, in, peace, britain, s, population, grew, 280, from, 1550, to, 1820, while, the, rest, of, western, europe, grew, 50, 80, seventy, percent, of, european, urbanisation, happened, in, britain, from, 1750, to, 1800, by, 1800, only, the, netherlands, was, more, urbanised, than, britain, this, was, only, possible, because, coal, coke, imported, cotton, brick, and, slate, had, replaced, wood, charcoal, flax, peat, and, thatch, the, latter, compete, with, land, grown, to, feed, people, while, mined, materials, do, not, yet, more, land, would, be, freed, when, chemical, fertilisers, replaced, manure, and, horse, s, work, was, mechanised, a, workhorse, needs, 1, 2, to, 2, 0, ha, 3, to, 5, acres, for, fodder, while, even, early, steam, engines, produced, four, times, more, mechanical, energy, in, 1700, five, sixths, of, the, coal, mined, worldwide, was, in, britain, while, the, netherlands, had, none, so, despite, having, europe, s, best, transport, lowest, taxes, and, most, urbanised, well, paid, and, literate, population, it, failed, to, industrialise, in, the, 18th, century, it, was, the, only, european, country, whose, cities, and, population, shrank, without, coal, britain, would, have, run, out, of, suitable, river, sites, for, mills, by, the, 1830s, based, on, science, and, experimentation, from, the, continent, the, steam, engine, was, developed, specifically, for, pumping, water, out, of, mines, many, of, which, in, britain, had, been, mined, to, below, the, water, table, although, extremely, inefficient, they, were, economical, because, they, used, unsaleable, coal, iron, rails, were, developed, to, transport, coal, which, was, a, major, economic, sector, in, britain, economic, historian, robert, allen, has, argued, that, high, wages, cheap, capital, and, very, cheap, energy, in, britain, made, it, the, ideal, place, for, the, industrial, revolution, to, occur, these, factors, made, it, vastly, more, profitable, to, invest, in, research, and, development, and, to, put, technology, to, use, in, britain, than, other, societies, however, two, 2018, studies, in, the, economic, history, review, showed, that, wages, were, not, particularly, high, in, the, british, spinning, sector, or, the, construction, sector, casting, doubt, on, allen, s, explanation, a, 2022, study, in, the, journal, of, political, economy, by, morgan, kelly, joel, mokyr, and, cormac, o, grada, found, that, industrialization, happened, in, areas, with, low, wages, and, high, mechanical, skills, whereas, literacy, banks, and, proximity, to, coal, had, little, explanatory, power, knowledge, of, innovation, was, spread, by, several, means, workers, who, were, trained, in, the, technique, might, move, to, another, employer, or, might, be, poached, a, common, method, was, for, someone, to, make, a, study, tour, gathering, information, where, he, could, during, the, whole, of, the, industrial, revolution, and, for, the, century, before, all, european, countries, and, america, engaged, in, study, touring, some, nations, like, sweden, and, france, even, trained, civil, servants, or, technicians, to, undertake, it, as, a, matter, of, state, policy, in, other, countries, notably, britain, and, america, this, practice, was, carried, out, by, individual, manufacturers, eager, to, improve, their, own, methods, study, tours, were, common, then, as, now, as, was, the, keeping, of, travel, diaries, records, made, by, industrialists, and, technicians, of, the, period, are, an, incomparable, source, of, information, about, their, methods, another, means, for, the, spread, of, innovation, was, by, the, network, of, informal, philosophical, societies, like, the, lunar, society, of, birmingham, in, which, members, met, to, discuss, natural, philosophy, and, often, its, application, to, manufacturing, the, lunar, society, flourished, from, 1765, to, 1809, and, it, has, been, said, of, them, they, were, if, you, like, the, revolutionary, committee, of, that, most, far, reaching, of, all, the, eighteenth, century, revolutions, the, industrial, revolution, other, such, societies, published, volumes, of, proceedings, and, transactions, for, example, the, london, based, royal, society, of, arts, published, an, illustrated, volume, of, new, inventions, as, well, as, papers, about, them, in, its, annual, transactions, there, were, publications, describing, technology, encyclopaedias, such, as, harris, s, lexicon, technicum, 1704, and, abraham, rees, s, cyclopaedia, 1802, 1819, contain, much, of, value, cyclopaedia, contains, an, enormous, amount, of, information, about, the, science, and, technology, of, the, first, half, of, the, industrial, revolution, very, well, illustrated, by, fine, engravings, foreign, printed, sources, such, as, the, descriptions, des, arts, et, m, tiers, and, diderot, s, encyclop, die, explained, foreign, methods, with, fine, engraved, plates, periodical, publications, about, manufacturing, and, technology, began, to, appear, in, the, last, decade, of, the, 18th, century, and, many, regularly, included, notice, of, the, latest, patents, foreign, periodicals, such, as, the, annales, des, mines, published, accounts, of, travels, made, by, french, engineers, who, observed, british, methods, on, study, tours, another, theory, is, that, the, british, advance, was, due, to, the, presence, of, an, entrepreneurial, class, which, believed, in, progress, technology, and, hard, work, the, existence, of, this, class, is, often, linked, to, the, protestant, work, ethic, see, max, weber, and, the, particular, status, of, the, baptists, and, the, dissenting, protestant, sects, such, as, the, quakers, and, presbyterians, that, had, flourished, with, the, english, civil, war, reinforcement, of, confidence, in, the, rule, of, law, which, followed, establishment, of, the, prototype, of, constitutional, monarchy, in, britain, in, the, glorious, revolution, of, 1688, and, the, emergence, of, a, stable, financial, market, there, based, on, the, management, of, the, national, debt, by, the, bank, of, england, contributed, to, the, capacity, for, and, interest, in, private, financial, investment, in, industrial, ventures, dissenters, found, themselves, barred, or, discouraged, from, almost, all, public, offices, as, well, as, education, at, england, s, only, two, universities, at, the, time, although, dissenters, were, still, free, to, study, at, scotland, s, four, universities, when, the, restoration, of, the, monarchy, took, place, and, membership, in, the, official, anglican, church, became, mandatory, due, to, the, test, act, they, thereupon, became, active, in, banking, manufacturing, and, education, the, unitarians, in, particular, were, very, involved, in, education, by, running, dissenting, academies, where, in, contrast, to, the, universities, of, oxford, and, cambridge, and, schools, such, as, eton, and, harrow, much, attention, was, given, to, mathematics, and, the, sciences, areas, of, scholarship, vital, to, the, development, of, manufacturing, technologies, historians, sometimes, consider, this, social, factor, to, be, extremely, important, along, with, the, nature, of, the, national, economies, involved, while, members, of, these, sects, were, excluded, from, certain, circles, of, the, government, they, were, considered, fellow, protestants, to, a, limited, extent, by, many, in, the, middle, class, such, as, traditional, financiers, or, other, businessmen, given, this, relative, tolerance, and, the, supply, of, capital, the, natural, outlet, for, the, more, enterprising, members, of, these, sects, would, be, to, seek, new, opportunities, in, the, technologies, created, in, the, wake, of, the, scientific, revolution, of, the, 17th, century, the, industrial, revolution, has, been, criticised, for, causing, ecological, collapse, mental, illness, pollution, and, detrimental, social, systems, it, has, also, been, criticised, for, valuing, profits, and, corporate, growth, over, life, and, wellbeing, multiple, movements, have, arisen, which, reject, aspects, of, the, industrial, revolution, such, as, the, amish, or, primitivists, humanists, and, individualists, criticise, the, industrial, revolution, for, mistreating, women, and, children, and, turning, men, into, work, machines, that, lacked, autonomy, critics, of, the, industrial, revolution, promoted, a, more, interventionist, state, and, formed, new, organisations, to, promote, human, rights, primitivism, argues, that, the, industrial, revolution, have, created, an, un, natural, frame, of, society, and, the, world, in, which, humans, need, to, adapt, to, an, un, natural, urban, landscape, in, which, humans, are, perpetual, cogs, without, personal, autonomy, certain, primitivists, argue, for, a, return, to, pre, industrial, society, while, others, argue, that, technology, such, as, modern, medicine, and, agriculture, are, all, positive, for, humanity, assuming, they, are, controlled, by, and, serve, humanity, and, have, no, effect, on, the, natural, environment, the, industrial, revolution, has, been,
