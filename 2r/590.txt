called, pieds, noirs, many, of, whom, lived, on, lands, taken, from, muslim, communities, during, the, nineteenth, century, sold, their, holdings, and, sought, refuge, in, algiers, and, other, algerian, cities, after, a, series, of, bloody, random, massacres, and, bombings, by, muslim, algerians, in, several, towns, and, cities, the, french, pieds, noirs, and, urban, french, population, began, to, demand, that, the, french, government, engage, in, sterner, countermeasures, including, the, proclamation, of, a, state, of, emergency, capital, punishment, for, political, crimes, denunciation, of, all, separatists, and, most, ominously, a, call, for, tit, for, tat, reprisal, operations, by, police, military, and, para, military, forces, colon, vigilante, units, whose,

many, of, the, governors, general, sent, by, paris, that, the, military, was, not, the, way, to, resolve, the, conflict, a, major, success, was, the, conversion, of, jacques, soustelle, who, went, to, algeria, as, governor, general, in, january, 1955, determined, to, restore, peace, soustelle, a, one, time, leftist, and, by, 1955, an, ardent, gaullist, began, an, ambitious, reform, program, the, soustelle, plan, aimed, at, improving, economic, conditions, among, the, muslim, population, the, fln, adopted, tactics, similar, to, those, of, nationalist, groups, in, asia, and, the, french, did, not, realize, the, seriousness, of, the, challenge, they, faced, until, 1955, when, the, fln, moved, into, urbanized, areas, an, important, watershed, in, the, war, of, independence, was, the, massacre, of, pieds, noirs, civilians, by, the, fln, near, the, town, of, philippeville, now, known, as, skikda, in, august, 1955, before, this, operation, fln, policy, was, to, attack, only, military, and, government, related, targets, the, commander, of, the, constantine, wilaya, region, however, decided, a, drastic, escalation, was, needed, the, killing, by, the, fln, and, its, supporters, of, 123, people, including, 71, french, including, old, women, and, babies, shocked, jacques, soustelle, into, calling, for, more, repressive, measures, against, the, rebels, the, french, authorities, stated, that, 1, 273, guerrillas, died, in, what, soustelle, admitted, were, severe, reprisals, the, fln, subsequently, claimed, that, 12, 000, muslims, were, killed, 122, soustelle, s, repression, was, an, early, cause, of, the, algerian, population, s, rallying, to, the, fln, after, philippeville, soustelle, declared, sterner, measures, and, an, all, out, war, began, in, 1956, demonstrations, by, french, algerians, caused, the, french, government, to, not, make, reforms, soustelle, s, successor, governor, general, robert, lacoste, a, socialist, abolished, the, algerian, assembly, lacoste, saw, the, assembly, which, was, dominated, by, pieds, noirs, as, hindering, the, work, of, his, administration, and, he, undertook, the, rule, of, algeria, by, decree, he, favored, stepping, up, french, military, operations, and, granted, the, army, exceptional, police, powers, a, concession, of, dubious, legality, under, french, law, to, deal, with, the, mounting, political, violence, at, the, same, time, lacoste, proposed, a, new, administrative, structure, to, give, algeria, some, autonomy, and, a, decentralized, government, whilst, remaining, an, integral, part, of, france, algeria, was, to, be, divided, into, five, districts, each, of, which, would, have, a, territorial, assembly, elected, from, a, single, slate, of, candidates, until, 1958, deputies, representing, algerian, districts, were, able, to, delay, the, passage, of, the, measure, by, the, national, assembly, of, france, in, august, and, september, 1956, the, leadership, of, the, fln,

forced, it, to, land, in, algiers, lacoste, had, the, fln, external, political, leaders, arrested, and, imprisoned, for, the, duration, of, the, war, this, action, caused, the, remaining, rebel,

in, his, speech, when, he, received, the, nobel, prize, in, literature, camus, said, that, when, faced, with, a, radical, choice, he, would, eventually, support, his, community, this, statement, made,

than, a, few, observers, doubtful, his, widow, claimed, that, camus, though, discreet, was, in, fact, an, ardent, supporter, of, french, algeria, in, the, last, years, of, his, life, to, increase, international, and, domestic, french, attention, to, their, struggle, the, fln, decided, to, bring, the, conflict, to, the, cities, and, to, call, a, nationwide, general, strike, and, also, to, plant, bombs, in, public, places, the, most, notable, instance, was, the, battle, of, algiers, which, began, on, september, 30, 1956, when, three, women, including, djamila, bouhired, and, zohra, drif, simultaneously, placed, bombs, at, three, sites, including, the, downtown, office, of, air, france, the, fln, carried, out, shootings, and, bombings, in, the, spring, of, 1957, resulting, in, civilian, casualties, and, a, crushing, response, from, the, authorities, general, jacques, massu, was, instructed, to, use, whatever, methods, deemed, necessary, to, restore, order, in, the, city, and, to, find, and, eliminate, terrorists, using, paratroopers, he, broke, the, strike, and, in, the, succeeding, months, destroyed, the, fln, infrastructure, in, algiers, but, the, fln, had, succeeded, in, showing, its, ability, to, strike, at, the, heart, of, french, algeria, and, to, assemble, a, mass, response, to, its, demands, among, urban, muslims, the, publicity, given, to, the, brutal, methods, used, by, the, army, to, win, the, battle, of, algiers, including, the, use, of, torture, strong, movement, control, and, curfew, called, quadrillage, and, where, all, authority, was, under, the, military, created, doubt, in, france, about, its, role, in, algeria, what, was, originally, pacification, or, a, public, order, operation, had, turned, into, a, colonial, war, accompanied, by, torture, during, 1956, and, 1957, the, fln, successfully, applied, hit, and, run, tactics, in, accordance, with, guerrilla, warfare, theory, whilst, some, of, this, was, aimed, at, military, targets, a, significant, amount, was, invested, in, a, terror, campaign, against, those, in, any, way, deemed, to, support, or, encourage, french, authority, this, resulted, in, acts, of, sadistic, torture, and, brutal, violence, against, all, including, women, and, children, specializing, in, ambushes, and, night, raids, and, avoiding, direct, contact, with, superior, french, firepower, the,

within, both, communities, in, algeria, the, revolutionaries, coercive, tactics, suggested, that, they, had, not, yet, inspired, the, bulk, of, the, muslim, people, to, revolt, against, french, colonial, rule, gradually, however, the, fln, gained, control, in, certain, sectors, of, the, aur, s, the, kabylie, and, other, mountainous, areas, around, constantine, and, south, of, algiers, and, oran, in, these, places, the, fln, established, a, simple, but, effective, although, frequently, temporary, military, administration, that, was, able, to, collect, taxes, and, food, and, to, recruit, manpower, but, it, was, never, able, to, hold, large, fixed, positions, the, loss, of, competent, field, commanders, both, on, the, battlefield, and, through, defections, and, political, purges, created, difficulties, for, the, fln, moreover, power, struggles, in, the, early, years, of, the, war, split, leadership, in, the, wilayat, particularly, in, the, aur, s, some, officers, created, their, own, fiefdoms, using, units, under, their, command, to, settle, old, scores, and, engage, in, private, wars, against, military, rivals, within, the, fln, despite, complaints, from, the, military, command, in, algiers, the, french, government, was, reluctant, for, many, months, to, admit, that, the, algerian, situation, was, out, of, control, and, that, what, was, viewed, officially, as, a, pacification, operation, had, developed, into, a, war, by, 1956, there, were, more, than, 400, 000, french, troops, in, algeria, although, the, elite, airborne, infantry, units, of, the, troupes, coloniales, and, the, foreign, legion, bore, the, brunt, of, offensive, counterinsurgency, combat, operations, approximately, 170, 000, muslim, algerians, also, served, in, the, regular, french, army, most, of, them, volunteers, france, also, sent, air, force, and, naval, units, to, the, algerian, theater, including, helicopters, in, addition, to, service, as, a, flying, ambulance, and, cargo, carrier, french, forces, utilized, the, helicopter, for, the, first, time, in, a, ground, attack, role, in, order, to, pursue, and, destroy, fleeing, fln, guerrilla, units, the, american, military, later, used, the, same, helicopter, combat, methods, in, the, vietnam, war, the, french, also, used, napalm, the, french, army, resumed, an, important, role, in, local, algerian, administration, through, the, special, administration, section, section, administrative, sp, cialis, e, sas, created, in, 1955, the, sas, s, mission, was, to, establish, contact, with, the, muslim, population, and, weaken, nationalist, influence, in, the, rural, areas, by, asserting, the, french, presence, there, sas, officers, called, k, pis, bleus, blue, caps, also, recruited, and, trained, bands, of, loyal, muslim, irregulars, known, as, harkis, armed, with, shotguns, and, using, guerrilla, tactics, similar, to, those, of, the, fln, the, harkis, who, eventually, numbered, about, 180, 000, volunteers, more, than, the, fln, activists, were, an, ideal, instrument, of, counterinsurgency, warfare, harkis, were, mostly, used, in, conventional, formations, either, in, all, algerian, units, commanded, by, french, officers, or, in, mixed, units, other, uses, included, platoon, or, smaller, size, units, attached, to, french, battalions, in, a, similar, way, as, the, kit, carson,

type, operations, was, during, the, battle, of, algiers, in, 1957, the, principal, french, employer, of, covert, agents, in, algiers, was, the, fifth, bureau, the, psychological, warfare, branch, the, fifth, bureau, made, extensive, use, of, turned, fln, members, one, such, network, being, run, by, captain, paul, alain, leger, of, the, 10th, paras, persuaded, to, work, for, the, french, forces, included, by, the, use, of, torture, and, threats, against, their, family, these, agents, mingled, with, fln, cadres, they, planted, incriminating, forged, documents, spread, false, rumors, of,

april, to, september, 1957, and, did, france, s, work, for, her, but, this, type, of, operation, involved, individual, operatives, rather, than, organized, covert, units, one, organized, pseudo, guerrilla, unit, however, was, created, in, december, 1956, by, the, french, dst, domestic, intelligence, agency, the, organization, of, the, french, algerian, resistance, oraf, a, group, of, counter, terrorists, had, as, its, mission, to, carry, out, false, flag, terrorist, attacks, with, the, aim, of, quashing, any, hopes, of, political, compromise, but, it, seemed, that, as, in, indochina, the, french, focused, on, developing, native, guerrilla, groups, that, would, fight, against, the, fln, one, of, whom, fought, in, the, southern, atlas, mountains, equipped, by, the, french, army, the,

the, unit, were, in, fact, those, of, dissidents, and, members, of, other, algerian, groups, killed, by, the, fln, the, french, army, finally, discovered, the, war, ruse, and, tried, to, hunt, down,

algeria, instituted, a, system, of, quadrillage, surveillance, using, a, grid, pattern, dividing, the, country, into, sectors, each, permanently, garrisoned, by, troops, responsible, for, suppressing, rebel, operations, in, their, assigned, territory, salan, s, methods, sharply, reduced, the, instances, of, fln, terrorism, but, tied, down, a, large, number, of, troops, in, static, defense, salan, also, constructed, a, heavily, patrolled, system, of, barriers, to, limit, infiltration, from, tunisia, and, morocco, the, best, known, of, these, was, the, morice, line, named, for, the, french, defense, minister, andr, morice, which, consisted, of, an, electrified, fence, barbed, wire, and, mines, over, a, 320, kilometer, stretch, of, the, tunisian, border, despite, ruthless, clashes, during, the, battle, of, the, borders, the, aln, failed, to, penetrate, these, defence, lines, the, french, military, command, ruthlessly, applied, the, principle, of, collective, responsibility, to, villages, suspected, of, sheltering, supplying, or, in, any, way, cooperating, with, the, guerrillas, villages, that, could, not, be, reached, by, mobile, units, were, subject, to, aerial, bombardment, fln, guerrillas, that, fled, to, caves, or, other, remote, hiding, places, were, tracked, and, hunted, down, in, one, episode, fln, guerrillas, who, refused, to, surrender, and, withdraw, from, a, cave, complex, were, dealt, with, by, french, foreign, legion, pioneer, troops, who, lacking, flamethrowers, or, explosives, simply, bricked, up, each, cave, leaving, the, residents, to, die, of, suffocation, finding, it, impossible, to, control, all, of, algeria, s, remote, farms, and, villages, the, french, government, also, initiated, a, program, of, concentrating, large, segments, of, the, rural, population, including, whole, villages, in, camps, under, military, supervision, to, prevent, them, from, aiding, the, rebels, in, the, three, years, 1957, 60, during, which, the, regroupement, program, was, followed, more, than, 2, million, algerians, were, removed, from, their, villages, mostly, in, the, mountainous, areas, and, resettled, in, the, plains, where, it, was, difficult, to, reestablish, their, previous, economic, and, social, systems, living, conditions, in, the, fortified, villages, were, poor, in, hundreds, of, villages, orchards, and, croplands, not, already, burned, by, french, troops, went, to, seed, for, lack, of, care, these, population, transfers, effectively, denied, the, use, of, remote, villages, to, fln, guerrillas, who, had, used, them, as, a, source, of, rations, and, manpower, but, also, caused, significant, resentment, on, the, part, of, the, displaced, villagers, relocation, s, social, and, economic, disruption, continued, to, be, felt, a, generation, later, at, the, same, time, the, french, tried, to, gain, support, from, the, civilian, population, by, providing, money, jobs, and, housing, to, farmers, the, french, army, shifted, its, tactics, at, the, end, of, 1958, from, dependence, on, quadrillage, to, the, use, of, mobile, forces, deployed, on, massive, search, and, destroy, missions, against, fln, strongholds, in, 1959, salan, s, successor, general, maurice, challe, appeared, to, have, suppressed, major, rebel, resistance, but, political, developments, had, already, overtaken, the, french, army, s, successes, recurrent, cabinet, crises, focused, attention, on, the, inherent, instability, of, the, fourth, republic, and, increased, the, misgivings, of, the, army, and, of, the, pieds, noirs, that, the, security, of, algeria, was, being, undermined, by, party, politics, army, commanders, chafed, at, what, they, took, to, be, inadequate, and, incompetent, political, initiatives, by, the, government, in, support, of, military, efforts, to, end, the, rebellion, the, feeling, was, widespread, that, another, debacle, like, that, of, indochina, in, 1954, was, in, the, offing, and, that, the, government, would, order, another, precipitate, pullout, and, sacrifice, french, honor, to, political, expediency, many, saw, in, de, gaulle, who, had, not, held, office, since, 1946, the, only, public, figure, capable, of, rallying, the, nation, and, giving, direction, to, the, french, government, after, his, time, as, governor, general, soustelle, returned, to, france, to, organize, support, for, de, gaulle, s, return, to, power, while, retaining, close, ties, to, the, army, and, the, pieds, noirs, by, early, 1958, he, had, organized, a, coup, d, tat, bringing, together, dissident, army, officers, and, pieds, noirs, with, sympathetic, gaullists, an, army, junta, under, general, massu, seized, power, in, algiers, on, the, night, of, may, 13, thereafter, known, as, the, may, 1958, crisis, general, salan, assumed, leadership, of, a, committee, of, public, safety, formed, to, replace, the, civil, authority, and, pressed, the, junta, s, demands, that, de, gaulle, be, named, by, french, president, ren, coty, to, head, a, government, of, national, unity, invested, with, extraordinary, powers, to, prevent, the, abandonment, of, algeria, on, may, 24, french, paratroopers, from, the, algerian, corps, landed, on, corsica, taking, the, french, island, in, a, bloodless, action, subsequently, preparations, were, made, in, algeria, for, operation, resurrection, which, had, as, its, objectives, the, seizure, of, paris, and, the, removal, of, the, french, government, resurrection, was, to, be, implemented, in, the, event, of, one, of, three, following, scenarios, were, de, gaulle, not, approved, as, leader, of, france, by, the, parliament, were, de, gaulle, to, ask, for, military, assistance, to, take, power, or, if, it, seemed, that, communist, forces, were, making, any, move, to, take, power, in, france, de, gaulle, was, approved, by, the, french, parliament, on, may, 29, by, 329, votes, against, 224, 15, hours, before, the, projected, launch, of, operation, resurrection, this, indicated, that, the, fourth, republic, by, 1958, no, longer, had, any, support, from, the, french, army, in, algeria, and, was, at, its, mercy, even, in, civilian, political, matters, this, decisive, shift, in, the, balance, of, power, in, civil, military, relations, in, france, in, 1958, and, the, threat, of, force, was, the, primary, factor, in, the, return, of, de, gaulle, to, power, in, france, many, people, regardless, of, citizenship, greeted, de, gaulle, s, return, to, power, as, the, breakthrough, needed, to, end, the, hostilities, on, his, trip, to, algeria, on, 4, june, 1958, de, gaulle, calculatedly, made, an, ambiguous, and, broad, emotional, appeal, to, all, the, inhabitants, declaring, je, vous, ai, compris, i, have, understood, you, de, gaulle, raised, the, hopes, of, the, pied, noir, and, the, professional, military, disaffected, by, the, indecisiveness, of, previous, governments, with, his, exclamation, of, vive, l, alg, rie, fran, aise, long, live, french, algeria, to, cheering, crowds, in, mostaganem, at, the, same, time, he, proposed, economic, social, and, political, reforms, to, improve, the, situation, of, the, muslims, nonetheless, de, gaulle, later, admitted, to, having, harbored, deep, pessimism, about, the, outcome, of, the, algerian, situation, even, then, meanwhile, he, looked, for, a, third, force, among, the, population, of, algeria, uncontaminated, by, the, fln, or, the, ultras, colon, extremists, through, whom, a, solution, might, be, found, de, gaulle, immediately, appointed, a, committee, to, draft, a, new, constitution, for, france, s, fifth, republic, which, would, be, declared, early, the, next, year, with, which, algeria, would, be, associated, but, of, which, it, would, not, form, an, integral, part, all, muslims, including, women, were, registered, for, the, first, time, on, electoral, rolls, to, participate, in, a, referendum, to, be, held, on, the, new, constitution, in, september, 1958, de, gaulle, s, initiative, threatened, the, fln, with, decreased, support, among, muslims, in, reaction, the, fln, set, up, the, provisional, government, of, the, algerian, republic, gouvernement, provisoire, de, la, r, publique, alg, rienne, gpra, a, government, in, exile, headed, by, abbas, and, based, in, tunis, before, the, referendum, abbas, lobbied, for, international, support, for, the, gpra, which, was, quickly, recognized, by, morocco, tunisia, china, and, several, other, african, arab, and, asian, countries, but, not, by, the, soviet, union, in, february, 1959, de, gaulle, was, elected, president, of, the, new, fifth, republic, he, visited, constantine, in, october, to, announce, a, program, to, end, the, war, and, create, an, algeria, closely, linked, to, france, de, gaulle, s, call, on, the, rebel, leaders, to, end, hostilities, and, to, participate, in, elections, was, met, with, adamant, refusal, the, problem, of, a, cease, fire, in, algeria, is, not, simply, a, military, problem, said, the, gpra, s, abbas, it, is, essentially, political, and, negotiation, must, cover, the, whole, question, of, algeria, secret, discussions, that, had, been, underway, were, broken, off, from, 1958, to, 1959, the, french, army, won, military, control, in, algeria, and, was, the, closest, it, would, be, to, victory, in, late, july, 1959, during, operation, jumelles, colonel, bigeard, whose, elite, paratrooper, unit, fought, at, dien, bien, phu, in, 1954, told, journalist, jean, lart, guy, source, we, are, not, making, war, for, ourselves, not, making, a, colonialist, war, bigeard, wears, no, shirt, he, shows, his, opened, uniform, as, do, my, officers, we, are, fighting, right, here, right, now, for, them, for, the, evolution, to, see, the,

who, are, hanging, on, in, order, to, still, be, able, to, talk, and, to, be, able, to, speak, for, during, this, period, in, france, however, popular, opposition, to, the, conflict, was, growing, notably, in, the, french, communist, party, then, one, of, the, country, s, strongest, political, forces, which, supported, the, algerian, revolution, thousands, of, relatives, of, conscripts, and, reserve, soldiers, suffered, loss, and, pain, revelations, of, torture, and, the, indiscriminate, brutality, of, the, army, against, the, muslim, population, prompted, widespread, revulsion, and, a, significant, constituency, supported, the, principle, of, national, liberation, by, 1959, it, was, clear, that, the, status, quo, was, untenable, and, france, could, either, grant, algeria, independence, or, allow, real, equality, with, the, muslims, de, gaulle, told, an, advisor, if, we, integrate, them, if, all, the, arabs, and, the, berbers, of, algeria, were, considered, french, how,

and, the, fln, position, was, gaining, support, france, s, seeming, intransigence, in, settling, a, colonial, war, that, tied, down, half, the, manpower, of, its, armed, forces, was, also, a, source, of, concern, to, its, north, atlantic, treaty, organization, allies, in, a, 16, september, 1959, statement, de, gaulle, dramatically, reversed, his, stand, and, uttered, the, words, self, determination, as, the, third, and, preferred, solution, which, he, envisioned, as, leading, to, majority, rule, in, an, algeria, formally, associated, with, france, in, tunis, abbas, acknowledged, that, de, gaulle, s, statement, might, be, accepted, as, a, basis, for, settlement, but, the, french, government, refused, to, recognize, the, gpra, as, the, representative, of, algeria, s, muslim,

televised, address, i, took, in, the, name, of, france, the, following, decision, the, algerians, will, have, the, free, choice, of, their, destiny, when, in, one, way, or, another, by, ceasefire, or, by, complete, crushing, of, the, rebels, we, will, have, put, an, end, to, the, fighting, when, after, a, prolonged, period, of, appeasement, the, population, will, have, become, conscious, of, the, stakes, and, thanks, to, us, realised, the, necessary, progress, in, political, economic, social, educational, and, other, domains, then, it, will, be, the, algerians, who, will, tell, us, what, they, want, to, be, your, french, of, algeria, how, can, you, listen, to, the, liars, and, the, conspirators, who, tell, you, that, if, you, grant, free, choice, to, the, algerians, france, and, de, gaulle, want, to, abandon, you, retreat, from, algeria, and, deliver, you, to, the, rebellion, i, say, to, all, of, our, soldiers, your, mission, comprises, neither, equivocation, nor, interpretation, you,

reached, granting, independence, to, all, of, algeria, 87, in, their, final, form, the, vian, accords, allowed, the, pied, noirs, equal, legal, protection, with, algerians, over, a, three, year, period, these, rights, included, respect, for, property, participation, in, public, affairs, and, a, full, range, of, civil, and, cultural, rights, at, the, end, of, that, period, however, all, algerian, residents, would, be, obliged, to, become, algerian, citizens, or, be, classified, as, aliens, with, the, attendant, loss, of, rights, the, agreement, also, allowed, france, to, establish, military, bases, in, algeria, even, after, independence, including, the, nuclear, test, site, of, regghane, the, naval, base, of, mers, el, kebir, and, the, air, base, of, bou, sfer, and, to, have, privileges, vis, vis, algerian, oil, the, oas, started, a, campaign, of, spectacular, terrorist, attacks, to, sabotage, the, vian, accords, hoping, that, if, enough, muslims, were, killed, a, general,

without, a, constructive, idea, following, the, cease, fire, tensions, developed, between, the, pied, noirs, community, and, their, former, protectors, in, the, french, army, an, oas, ambush, of, french, troops, on, 20, march, was, followed, by, 20, 000, gendarmes, and, soldiers, being, ordered, to, occupy, the, predominantly, pied, noir, district, of, bab, el, oued, in, algiers, 524, a, week, later, french, soldiers, from, the, 4th, tirailleur, regiment, an, 80, muslim, unit, with, french, officers, opened, fire, on, a, crowd, of, pied, noir, demonstrators, in, algiers, killing, between, 50, and, 80, civilians, total, casualties, in, these, three, incidents, were, 326, killed, and, wounded, amongst, the, pied, noirs, and, 110, french, military, personnel, dead, or, injured, 524, 5, a,

the, massacre, served, to, greatly, embitter, the, pied, noir, community, and, led, to, a, massive, surge, of, support, for, the, oas, 95, in, the, second, referendum, on, the, independence, of, algeria, held, in, april, 1962, 91, percent, of, the, french, electorate, approved, the, evian, accords, on, 1, july, 1962, some, 6, million, of, a, total, algerian, electorate, of, 6, 5, million, cast, their, ballots, the, vote, was, nearly, unanimous, with, 5, 992, 115, votes, for, independence, 16, 534, against, with, most, pied, noirs, and, harkis, either, having, fled, or, abstaining, de, gaulle, pronounced, algeria, an, independent, country, on, 3, july, the, provisional, executive, however, proclaimed, 5, july, the, 132nd, anniversary, of, the, french, entry, into, algeria, as, the, day, of, national, independence, during, the, three, months, between, the, cease, fire, and, the, french, referendum, on, algeria, the, oas, unleashed, a, new, campaign, the, oas, sought, to, provoke, a, major, breach, in, the, ceasefire, by, the, fln, but, the, attacks, now, were, aimed, also, against, the, french, army, and, police, enforcing, the, accords, as, well, as, against, muslims, it, was, the, most, wanton, carnage, that, algeria, had, witnessed, in, eight, years, of, savage, warfare, oas, operatives, set, off, an, average, of, 120, bombs, per, day, in, march, with, targets, including, hospitals, and, schools, on, june, 7, 1962, the, university, of, algiers, library, was, burned, by, the, oas, this, cultural, devastation, was, commemorated, by, muslim, countries, issuing, postage, stamps, commemorating, the, tragic, event, these, included, algeria, egypt, iraq, jordan, kuwait, libya, saudi, arabia, syria, and, yemen, during, the, summer, of, 1962, a, rush, of, pied, noirs, fled, to, france, within, a, year, 1, 4, million, refugees, including, almost, the, entire, jewish, community, had, joined, the, exodus, despite, the, declaration, of, independence, on, 5, july, 1962, the, last, french, forces, did, not, leave, the, naval, base, of, mers, el, k, bir, until, 1967, the, evian, accords, had, permitted, france, to, maintain, its, military, presence, for, fifteen, years, so, the, withdrawal, in, 1967, was, significantly, ahead, of, schedule, cairns, writing, from, paris, in, 1962, declared, in, some, ways, the, last, year, has, been, the, worse, tension, has, never, been, higher, disenchantment, in, france, at, least, has, never, been, greater, the, mindless, cruelty, of, it, all, has, never, been, more, absurd, and, savage, this, last, year, stretching, from, the, hopeful, spring, of, 1961, to, the, ceasefire, of, 18, march, 1962, spanned, a, season, of, shadow, boxing, false, threats, capitulation, and, murderous, hysteria, french, algeria, died, badly, its, agony, was, marked, by, panic, and, brutality, as, ugly, as, the, record, of, european, imperialism, could, show, in, the, spring, of, 1962, the, unhappy, corpse, of, empire, still, shuddered, and, lashed, out, and, stained, itself, in, fratricide, the, whole, episode, of, its, death, measured, at, least, seven, and, half, years, constituted, perhaps, the, most, pathetic, and, sordid, event, in, the, entire, history, of, colonialism, it, is, hard, to, see, how, anybody, of, importance, in, the, tangled, web, of, the, conflict, came, out, looking, well, nobody, won, the, conflict, nobody, dominated, it, 87, at, the, beginning, of, the, war, on, the, algerian, side, it, was, necessary, to, compensate, for, military, weakness, with, political, and, diplomatic, struggle, in, the, asymmetric, conflict, between, france, and, the, fln, at, this, time, victory, seemed, extremely, difficult, the, algerian, revolution, began, with, the, insurrection, of, november, 1, when, the, fln, organized, a, series, of, attacks, against, the, french, army, and, military, infrastructure, and, published, a, statement, calling, on, algerians, to, get, involved, in, the, revolution, this, initial, campaign, had, limited, impact, the, events, remained, largely, unreported, especially, by, the, french, press, only, two, newspaper, columns, in, le, monde, and, one, in, l, express, and, the, insurrection, all, but, subsided, nevertheless, fran, ois, mitterrand, the, french, minister, of, the, interior, sent, 600, soldiers, to, algeria, furthermore, the, fln, was, weak, militarily, at, the, beginning, of, the, war, it, was, created, in, 1954, and, had, few, members, and, its, ally, the, aln, was, also, underdeveloped, having, only, 3, 000, men, badly, equipped, and, trained, unable, to, compete, with, the, french, army, the, nationalist, forces, also, suffered, from, internal, divisions, as, proclaimed, in, the, statement, of, 1954, the, fln, developed, a, strategy, to, avoid, large, scale, warfare, and, internationalize, the, conflict, appealing, politically, and, diplomatically, to, influence, french, and, world, opinion, this, political, aspect, would, reinforce, the, legitimacy, of, the, fln, in, algeria, which, was, all, the, more, necessary, since, algeria, unlike, other, colonies, had, been, formally, incorporated, as, a, part, of, metropolitan, france, the, french, counter, strategy, aimed, to, keep, the, conflict, internal, and, strictly, french, to, maintain, its, image, abroad, the, fln, succeeded, and, the, conflict, rapidly, became, international, embroiled, with, the, tensions, of, the, cold, war, and, the, emergence, of, the, third, world, firstly, the, fln, exploited, the, tensions, between, the, american, led, western, bloc, and, the, soviet, led, communist, bloc, fln, sought, material, support, from, the, communists, goading, the, americans, to, support, of, algerian, independence, to, keep, the, country, on, the, western, side, furthermore, the, fln, used, the, tensions, within, each, bloc, including, between, france, and, the, us, and, between, the, ussr, and, mao, s, china, the, us, which, generally, opposed, colonisation, had, every, interest, in, pushing, france, to, give, algeria, its, independence, secondly, the, fln, could, count, on, third, world, support, after, world, war, ii, many, new, states, were, created, in, the, wave, of, decolonization, in, 1945, there, were, 51, states, in, the, un, but, by, 1965, there, were, 117, this, upturned, the, balance, of, power, in, the, un, with, the, recently, decolonized, countries, now, a, majority, with, great, influence, most, of, the, new, states, were, part, of, the, third, world, movement, proclaiming, a, third, non, aligned, path, in, a, bipolar, world, and, opposing, colonialism, in, favor, of, national, renewal, and, modernization, they, felt, concerned, in, the, algerian, conflict, and, supported, the, fln, on, the, international, stage, for, example, a, few, days, after, the, first, insurrection, in, 1954, radio, yugoslavia, third, worldist, begun, to, vocally, support, the, struggle, of, algeria, the, 1955, bandung, conference, internationally, recognized, the, fln, as, representing, algeria, and, third, world, countries, brought, up, the, algerian, conflict, at, the, un, general, assembly, the, french, government, grew, more, and, more, isolated, after, the, battle, of, algiers, greatly, weakened, the, fln, it, was, forced, to, accept, more, direct, support, from, abroad, financial, and, military, support, from, china, helped, to, rebuild, the, aln, to, 20, 000, men, the, ussr, competed, with, china, and, khrushchev, intensified, moral, support, for, the, algerian, rebellion, which, in, turn, pushed, the, usa, to, react, in, 1958, the, provisional, government, of, the, algerian, republic, pgar, was, created, naming, official, representatives, to, negotiate, with, france, tense, negotiations, lasted, three, years, eventually, turning, to, algeria, s, advantage, the, pgar, was, supported, by, the, third, world, and, the, communist, bloc, while, france, had, few, allies, under, pressure, from, the, un, the, usa, and, a, war, weary, public, france, eventually, conceded, in, the, evian, agreements, according, to, matthew, connelly, this, strategy, of, internationalization, became, a, model, for, other, revolutionary, groups, such, as, the, palestine, liberation, organization, of, yasser, arafat, and, the, african, national, congress, of, nelson, mandela, women, participated, in, a, variety, of, roles, during, the, algerian, war, the, majority, of, muslim, women, who, became, active, participants, did, so, on, the, side, of, the, national, liberation, front, fln, the, french, included, some, women, both, muslim, and, french, in, their, war, effort, but, they, were, not, as, fully, integrated, nor, were, they, charged, with, the, same, breadth, of, tasks, as, the, women, on, the, algerian, side, the, total, number, of, women, involved, in, the, conflict, as, determined, by, post, war, veteran, registration, is, numbered, at, 11, 000, but, it, is, possible, that, this, number, was, significantly, higher, due, to, underreporting, urban, and, rural, women, s, experiences, in, the, revolution, differed, greatly, urban, women, who, constituted, about, twenty, percent, of, the, overall, force, had, received, some, kind, of, education, and, usually, chose, to, enter, on, the, side, of, the, fln, of, their, own, accord, largely, illiterate, rural, women, on, the, other, hand, the, remaining, eighty, percent, due, to, their, geographic, location, in, respect, to, the, operations, of, fln, often, became, involved, in, the, conflict, as, a, result, of, proximity, paired, with, force, women, operated, in, a, number, of, different, areas, during, the, course, of, the, rebellion, women, participated, actively, as, combatants, spies, fundraisers, as, well, as, nurses, launderers, and, cooks, women, assisted, the, male, fighting, forces, in, areas, like, transportation, communication, and, administration, 223, the, range, of, involvement, by, a, woman, could, include, both, combatant, and, non, combatant, roles, eveline, safir, lavalette, was, a, notable, contributor, to, the, revolution, as, a, distributor, of, pamphlets, for, the, fln, s, underground, newspaper, while, most, women, s, tasks, were, non, combatant, their, less, frequent, violent, acts, were, more, noticed, the, reality, was, that, rural, women, in, maquis, rural, areas, support, networks, contained, the, overwhelming, majority, of, those, who, participated, female, combatants, were, in, the, minority, perhaps, the, most, famous, incident, involving, algerian, women, revolutionaries, was, the, milk, bar, caf, bombing, of, 1956, when, zohra, drif, and, yacef, sa, di, planted, three, bombs, one, in, the, air, france, office, in, the, mauritania, building, in, algiers, which, did, not, explode, one, in, a, cafeteria, on, the, rue, michelet, and, another, at, the, milk, bar, caf, which, killed, 3, young, women, and, injured, multiple, adults, and, children, algerian, communist, party, member, raymonde, peschard, was, initially, accused, of, being, an, accomplice, to, the, bombing, and, was, forced, to, flee, from, the, colonial, authorities, in, september, 1957, though, drif, and, sa, di, were, arrested, and, sentenced, to, twenty, years, hard, labor, in, the, barbarossa, prison, drif, was, pardoned, by, charles, de, gaulle, on, the, anniversary, of, algerian, independence, in, 1962, pieds, noirs, including, indigenous, mizrachi, and, sephardi, jews, and, harkis, accounted, for, 13, of, the, total, population, of, algeria, in, 1962, for, the, sake, of, clarity, each, group, s, exodus, is, described, separately, here, although, their, fate, shared, many, common, elements, pied, noir, literally, black, foot, is, a, term, used, to, name, the, european, descended, population, mostly, catholic, who, had, resided, in, algeria, for, generations, it, is, sometimes, used, to, include, the, indigenous, maghrebi, jewish, population, as, well, which, likewise, emigrated, after, 1962, europeans, arrived, in, algeria, as, immigrants, from, all, over, the, western, mediterranean, particularly, france, spain, italy, and, malta, starting, in, 1830, the, jews, arrived, in, several, waves, some, coming, as, early, as, 600, bc, and, during, the, roman, period, known, as, the, maghrebi, jews, or, berber, jews, the, maghrebi, jewish, population, was, outnumbered, by, the, sephardic, jews, who, were, driven, out, of, spain, in, 1492, and, was, further, strengthened, by, marrano, refugees, from, the, spanish, inquisition, through, the, 16th, century, algerian, jews, largely, embraced, french, citizenship, after, the, d, cret, cr, mieux, in, 1871, in, 1959, the, pieds, noirs, numbered, 1, 025, 000, 85, of, european, christian, descent, and, 15, were, made, up, of, the, indigenous, algerian, population, of, maghrebi, and, sephardi, jewish, descent, and, accounted, for, 10, 4, of, the, total, population, of, algeria, in, just, a, few, months, in, 1962, 900, 000, of, them, fled, the, first, third, prior, to, the, referendum, in, the, largest, relocation, of, population, to, europe, since, the, second, world, war, a, motto, used, in, the, fln, message, to, the, pieds, noirs, was, a, suitcase, or, a, coffin, la, valise, ou, le, cercueil, repurposing, a, slogan, first, coined, years, earlier, by, pied, noir, ultras, when, rallying, the, european, community, to, their, hardcore, line, the, french, government, claimed, not, to, have, anticipated, such, a, massive, exodus, it, estimated, that, a,

their, arrival, a, minority, of, departing, pieds, noirs, including, soldiers, destroyed, their, property, before, departure, to, protest, and, as, a, desperate, symbolic, attempt, to, leave, no, trace, of, over, a, century, of, european, presence, but, the, vast, majority, of, their, goods, and, houses, were, left, intact, and, abandoned, a, large, number, of, panicked, people, camped, for, weeks, on, the, docks, of, algerian, harbors, waiting, for, a, space, on, a, boat, to, france, about, 100, 000, pieds, noirs, chose, to, remain, but, most, of, those, gradually, left, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, primarily, due, to, residual, hostility, against, them, including, machine, gunning, of, public, places, in, oran, the, so, called, harkis, from, the, algerian, arabic, dialect, word, harki, soldier, were, indigenous, muslim, algerians, as, opposed, to, european, descended, catholics, or, indigenous, algerian, maghrebi, jews, who, fought, as, auxiliaries, on, the, french, side, some, of, these, were, veterans, of, the, free, french, forces, who, participated, in, the, liberation, of, france, during, world, war, ii, or, in, the, indochina, war, the, term, also, came, to, include, civilian, indigenous, algerians, who, supported, a, french, algeria, according, to, french, government, figures, there, were, 236, 000, algerian, muslims, serving, in, the, french, army, in, 1962, four, times, more, than, in, the, fln, either, in, regular, units, spahis, and, tirailleurs, or, as, irregulars, harkis, and, moghaznis, some, estimates, suggest, that, with, their, families, the, indigenous, muslim, loyalists, may, have, numbered, as, many, as, 1, million, in, 1962, around, 90, 000, harkis, took, refuge, in, france, despite, french, government, policy, against, this, pierre, messmer, minister, of, the, armies, and, louis, joxe, minister, for, algerian, affairs, gave, orders, to, this, effect, the, harkis, were, seen, as, traitors, by, many, algerians, and, many, of, those, who, stayed, behind, suffered, severe, reprisals, after, independence, french, historians, estimate, that, somewhere, between, 50, 000, and, 150, 000, harkis, and, members, of, their, families, were, killed, by, the, fln, or, by, lynch, mobs, in, algeria, often, in, atrocious, circumstances, or, after, torture, 537, the, abandonment, of, the, harkis, both, the, lack, of, recognition, of, those, who, died, defending, french, algeria, and, the, neglect, of, those, who, escaped, to, france, remains, an, issue, that, france, has, not, fully, resolved, although, the, government, of, jacques, chirac, made, efforts, to, recognize, the, suffering, of, these, former, allies, death, toll, estimates, vary, algerian, historians, and, the, fln, estimated, that, nearly, eight, years, of, revolution, caused, 1, 5, million, algerian, deaths, some, other, french, and, algerian, sources, later, put, the, figure, at, approximately, 960, 000, dead, while, french, officials, and, historians, estimated, it, at, around, 350, 000, but, this, was, regarded, by, many, as, an, underestimate, french, military, authorities, listed, their, losses, at, nearly, 25, 600, dead, 6, 000, from, non, combat, related, causes, and, 65, 000, wounded, european, descended, civilian, casualties, exceeded, 10, 000, including, 3, 000, dead, in, 42, 000, recorded, violent, incidents, according, to, french, official, figures, during, the, war, the, army, security, forces, and, militias, killed, 141, 000, presumed, rebel, combatants, 538, but, it, is, still, unclear, whether, this, includes, some, civilians, more, than, 12, 000, algerians, died, in, internal, fln, purges, during, the, war, in, france, an, additional, 5, 000, died, in, the, caf, wars, between, the,

horne, estimated, algerian, casualties, during, the, span, of, eight, years, to, be, around, 1, million, uncounted, thousands, of, muslim, civilians, died, in, french, army, ratissages, bombing, raids, or, vigilante, reprisals, the, war, uprooted, more, than, 2, million, algerians, who, were, forced, to, relocate, in, french, camps, or, to, flee, into, the, algerian, hinterland, where, many, thousands, died, of, starvation, disease, and, exposure, one, source, estimates, 300, 000, algerians, civilians, perished, of, starvation, depredation, and, disease, inside, and, outside, the, camps,

benyoucef, ben, khedda, this, led, to, several, disputes, among, his, rivals, in, the, fln, which, were, quickly, suppressed, by, ben, bella, s, rapidly, growing, support, most, notably, within, the, armed, forces, by, september, bella, was, in, de, facto, control, of, algeria, and, was, elected, premier, in, a, one, sided, election, on, september, 20, and, was, recognised, by, the, u, s, on, september, 29, algeria, was, admitted, as, the, 109th, member, of, the, united, nations, on, october, 8, 1962, afterward, ben, bella, declared, that, algeria, would, follow, a, neutral, course, in, world, politics, within, a, week, he, met, with, u, s, president, john, f, kennedy, requesting, more, aid, for, algeria, with, fidel, castro, and, expressed, approval, of, castro, s, demands, for, the, abandonment, of, guantanamo, bay, bella, returned, to, algeria, and, requested, that, france, withdraw, from, its, bases, there, in, november, his, government, banned, political, parties, providing, that, the, fln, would, be, the, only, party, allowed, to, function, overtly, shortly, thereafter, in, 1965, bella, was, deposed, and, placed, under, house, arrest, and, later, exiled, by, houari, boum, di, nne, who, served, as, president, until, his, death, in, 1978, algeria, remained, stable, though, in, a, one, party, state, until, a, violent, civil, war, broke, out, in, the, 1990s, for, algerians, of, many, political, factions, the, legacy, of, their, war, of, independence, was, a, legitimization, or, even, sanctification, of, the, unrestricted, use, of, force, in, achieving, a, goal, deemed, to, be, justified, once, invoked, against, foreign, colonialists, the, same, principle, could, also, be, turned, with, relative, ease, against, fellow, algerians, the, fln, s, struggle, to, overthrow, colonial, rule, and, the, ruthlessness, exhibited, by, both, sides, in, that, struggle, were, mirrored, 30, years, later, by, the, passion, determination, and, brutality, of, the, conflict, between, the, fln, government, and, the, islamist, opposition, the, american, journalist, adam, shatz, wrote, that, much, of, the, same, methods, employed, by, the, fln, against, the, french, such, as, the, militarization, of, politics, the, use, of, islam, as, a, rallying, cry, the, exaltation, of, jihad, to, create, an, essentially, secular, state, in, 1962, were, used, by, islamic, fundamentalists, in, their, efforts, to, overthrow, the, fln, regime, in, the, 1990s, massacres, and, torture, were, frequent, from, the, beginning, of, the, colonization, of, algeria, which, started, in, 1830, atrocities, committed, against, algerians, by, the, french, army, during, the, war, included, indiscriminate, shootings, into, civilian, crowds, such, as, during, the, paris, massacre, of, 1961, execution, of, civilians, when, rebel, attacks, occurred, bombings, of, villages, suspected, of, helping, the, fln, rape, disembowelment, of, pregnant, women, imprisonment, without, food, in, small, cells, some, of, which, were, small, enough, to, impede, lying, down, throwing, detainees, from, helicopters, and, into, the, sea, with, concrete, on, their, feet, and, burying, people, alive, torture, methods, included, beatings, mutilations, burning, hanging, by, the, feet, or, hands, torture, by, electroshock, waterboarding, sleep, deprivation, and, sexual, assaults, during, the, war, the, french, military, relocated, entire, villages, to, centres, de, regroupements, regrouping, centres, which, were, built, for, forcibly, displaced, civilian,

with, some, being, forced, into, labour, a, notable, instance, of, rape, was, that, of, djamila, boupacha, a, 23, years, old, algerian, woman, who, was, arrested, in, 1960, accused, of, attempting, to, bomb, a, cafe, in, algiers, her, confession, was, obtained, through, torture, and, rape, her, subsequent, trial, affected, french, public, opinion, about, the, french, army, s, methods, in, algeria, after, publicity, of, the, case, by, simone, de, beauvoir, and, gis, le, halimi, torture, was, also, used, by, both, sides, during, the, first, indochina, war, 1946, 54, claude, bourdet,

and, their, colonial, mastery, of, algeria, general, paul, aussaresses, admitted, in, 2000, that, systematic, torture, techniques, were, used, during, the, war, and, justified, them, he, also, recognized, the, assassination, of, lawyer, ali, boumendjel, and, the, head, of, the, fln, in, algiers, larbi, ben, m, hidi, which, had, been, disguised, as, suicides, marcel, bigeard, who, called, fln, activists, savages, claimed, torture, was, a, necessary, evil, to, the, contrary, general, jacques, massu, denounced, it, following, aussaresses, s, revelations, and, before, his, death, pronounced, himself, in, favor, of, an, official, condemnation, of, the, use, of, torture, during, the, war, bigeard, s, justification, of, torture, has, been, criticized, by, joseph, dor, archbishop, of, strasbourg, marc, lienhard, president, of, the, lutheran, church, of, augsbourg, confession, in, alsace, lorraine, and, others, in, june, 2000, bigeard, declared, that, he, was, based, in, sidi,

aln, activist, louisette, ighilahriz, had, been, tortured, by, general, massu, however, since, general, massu, s, revelations, bigeard, has, admitted, the, use, of, torture, although, he, denies, having, personally, used, it, and, has, declared, you, are, striking, the, heart, of, an, 84, year, old, man, bigeard, also, recognized, that, larbi, ben, m, hidi, was, assassinated, and, that, his, death, was, disguised, as, a, suicide, in, 2018, france, officially, admitted, that, torture, was, systematic, and, routine, specializing, in, ambushes, and, night, raids, to, avoid, direct, contact, with, superior, french, firepower, the, internal, forces, targeted, army, patrols, military, encampments, police, posts, and, colonial, farms, mines, and, factories, as, well, as, transportation, and, communications, facilities, at, first, the, fln, targeted, only, muslim, officials, of, the, colonial, regime, later, they, coerced, maimed, or, killed, village, elders, government, employees, and, even, simple, peasants, who, refused, to, support, them, throat, slitting, and, decapitation, were, commonly, used, by, the, fln, as, mechanisms, of, terror, 134, 5, some, other, atrocities, were, committed, by, the, more, militant, sections, of, the, fln, as, collective, reprisals, against, the, pieds, noirs, population, in, response, to, french, repression, the, more, extreme, cases, occurred, in, places, like, the, town, of, al, halia, where, some, european, residents, were, raped, and, disemboweled, while, children, had, been, murdered, by, slitting, their, throats, or, banging, their, heads, against, walls, during, the, first, two, and, a, half, years, of, the, conflict, the, guerrillas, killed, an, estimated, 6, 352, muslim, and, 1, 035, non, muslim, civilians, 135, although, the, opening, of, the, archives, of, the, ministry, of, foreign, affairs, after, a, 30, year, lock, up, enabled, some, new, historical, research, on, the, war, including, jean, charles, jauffret, s, book, la, guerre, d, alg, rie, par, les, documents, the, algerian, war, according, to, the, documents, many, remain, inaccessible, the, recognition, in, 1999, by, the, national, assembly, permitted, the, algerian, war, to, enter, the, syllabi, of, french, schools, in, france, the, war, was, known, as, la, guerre, sans, nom, the, war, without, a, name, while, it, was, being, fought, the, government, variously, described, the, war, as, the, algerian, events, the, algerian, problem, and, the, algerian, dispute, the, mission, of, the, french, army, was, ensuring, security, maintaining, order, and, pacification, but, was, never, described, as, fighting, a, war, the, fln, were, referred, to, as, criminals, bandits, outlaws, terrorists, and, fellagha, a, derogatory, arabic, word, meaning, road, cutters, but, often, mistranslated, as, throat, cutters, in, reference, to, the, fln, s, frequent, method, of, execution, which, made, people, wear, the, kabylian, smile, by, cutting, their, throats, pulling, their, tongues, out, and, leaving, them, to, bleed, to, death, after, reports, of, the, widespread, use, of, torture, by, french, forces, started, to, reach, france, in, 1956, 57, the, war, become, commonly, known, as, la, sale, guerre, the, dirty, war, a, term, that, is, still, used, today, and, reflects, the, very, negative, memory, of, the, war, in, france, 145, as, the, war, was, officially, a, police, action, no, monuments, were, built, for, decades, to, honour, the, about, 25, 000, french, soldiers, killed, in, the, war, and, the, defense, ministry, refused, to, classify, veterans, as, veterans, until, the, 1970s, 219, when, a, monument, to, the, unknown, soldier, of, the, algerian, war, was, erected, in, 1977, french, president, val, ry, giscard, d, estaing, in, his, dedication, speech, refused, to, use, the, words, war, or, algeria, but, instead, used, the, phrase, the, unknown, soldier, of, north, africa, 219, a, national, monument, to, the, french, war, dead, was, not, built, until, 1996, and, even, then, spoke, only, of, those, killed, fighting, in, afrique, du, nord, and, was, located, in, a, decrepit, area, of, paris, rarely, visited, by, tourists, as, if, to, hide, the, monument, 226, further, adding, to, the, silence, were, the, vested, interests, of, french, politicians, fran, ois, mitterrand, the, french, president, 1981, to, 1995, had, been, the, interior, minister, from, 1954, to, 1955, and, the, justice, minister, from, 1955, to, 1957, when, he, had, been, deeply, involved, in, the, repression, of, the, fln, and, it, was, only, after, mitterrand, s, death, in, 1996, that, his, french, socialist, party, started, to, become, willing, to, talk, about, the, war, and, even, then, remained, very, guarded, about, his, role, 232, likewise, de, gaulle, had, promised, in, the, vian, agreements, that, the, pieds, noirs, could, remain, in, algeria, but, after, independence, the, fln, freely, violated, the, accords, and, led, to, the, entire, pied, noir, population, fleeing, to, france, usually, with, only, the, clothes, they, were, wearing, as, they, had, lost, everything, they, had, in, algeria, a, circumstance, further, embarrassing, the, defeated, nation, 232, one, of, the, first, books, about, the, war, in, english, a, scattering, of, dust, by, the, american, journalist, herb, greer, in, 1962, depicted, very, favorably, the, algerian, struggle, for, independence, most, work, in, english, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, were, the, work, of, left, wing, scholars, who, were, focused, on, explaining, the, fln, as, a, part, of, a, generational, change, in, algerian, nationalism, and, depicted, the, war, as, a, reaction, to, intolerable, oppression, and, or, an, attempt, by, the, peasants, impoverished, by, french, policies, to, improve, their, lot, 222, 5, one, of, the, few, military, histories, of, the, war, was, the, algerian, insurrection, by, the, retired, british, army, officer, edgar, o, ballance, who, wrote, with, unabashed, admiration, for, french, high, command, during, the, war, and, saw, the, fln, as, a, terrorist, group, o, ballance, concluded, that, the, tactics, which, won, the, war, militarily, for, the, french, lost, the, war, for, them, politically, 225, 6, in, 1977, the, british, journalist, alistair, horne, published, a, savage, war, of, peace, regarded, by, some, authors, as, the, leading, book, written, on, the, subject, in, english, though, written, from, a, french, rather, than, algerian, perspective, 226, fifteen, years, after, the, end, of, the, war, horne, was, accused, of, not, being, concerned, about, right, or, wrong, but, rather, about, cause, and, effect, 217, 35, living, in, paris, at, the, time, of, the, war, horne, had, condemned, french, intervention, during, the, suez, crisis, and, the, french, bombing, of, the, tunisian, village, of, sakiet, sidi, youssef, in, 1958, he, d, argued, that, the, inflexibility, of, the, fln, had, won, algeria, independence, creating, a, sense, of, algerian, national, identity, and, leading, the, front, to, rule, over, authoritarian, but, progressive, fln, regime, 217, 35, in, a, 1977, column, published, in, the, times, literary, supplement, reviewing, the, book, a, savage, war, of, peace, iraqi, born, british, historian, elie, kedourie, attacked, horne, as, an, apologist, for, terrorism, and, accused, him, of, engaging, in, the, cosy, pieties, of, bien, pensants, kedorie, condemned, the, western, intellectuals, who, excuse, terrorism, when, committed, by, third, world, revolutionaries, 217, 35, kedourie, claimed, that, far, from, a, mass, movement, the, fln, were, a, small, gang, of, murderous, intellectuals, who, used, brutal, terrorist, tactics, against, the, french, citizens, and, military, and, against, any, muslim, loyal, to, the, french, he, further, claimed, that, the, front, had, been, beaten, by, 1959, 217, 235, kedourie, charged, that, de, gaulle, had, cynically, sacrificed, the, colons, and, the, harkis, as, he, had, chosen, to, disregard, his, constitutional, oath, as, president, to, protect, all, frenchmen, and, ensure, that, the, french, withdrew, and, handed, over, power, to, the, only, organized, body, of, armed, men, who, were, on, the, scene, a, civilized, government, thus, acting, for, all, the, world, like, the, votary, of, some, mao, or, ho, in, the, barbarous, belief, that, legitimacy, comes, from, the, power, of, the, gun, 227, in, 1992, american, historian, john, ruedy, the, focus, of, whose, research, was, the, history, of, the, maghreb, and, french, colonialism, in, algeria, published, modern, algeria, origins, and, development, of, a, nation, 232, 3, ruedy, wrote, that, under, french, rule, the, traditional, social, structure, had, been, so, completely, destroyed, that, when, the, fln, launched, its, independence, struggle, in, 1954, the, only, way, of, asserting, one, s, interests, was, through, the, law, of, the, gun, which, explains, why, the, fln, was, so, violent, not, only, in, regards, to, its, enemies, but, also, within, the, movement, the, fln, thus, according, to, ruedy, formed, the, basis, of, an, alternative, political, culture, based, on, brute, force, that, has, persisted, ever, since, 233, before, the, war, algeria, was, a, popular, setting, for, french, films, the, british, professor, leslie, hill, having, written, in, the, late, 1920s, and, 1930s, for, instance, north, africa, provided, film, makers, in, france, with, a, ready, fund, of, familiar, images, of, the, exotics, mingling, for, instance, the, languid, eroticism, of, arabian, nights, with, the, infinite, and, hazy, vistas, of, the, sahara, to, create, a, powerful, confection, of, tragic, heroism, and, passionate, love, 147, during, the, war, itself, french, censors, banned, the, entire, subject, of, the, war, 147, 8, since, 1962, when, film, censorship, relating, to, the, war, eased, french, films, dealing, with, the, conflict, have, consistently, portrayed, the, war, as, a, set, of, conflicting, memories, and, rival, narratives, which, ones, being, correct, are, left, unclear, with, most, films, dealing, with, the, war, taking, a, disjointed, chronological, structure, in, which, scenes, before, during, and, after, the, war, are, juxtaposed, out, of, sequence, with, one, film, critic, referring, to, the, cinematic, algeria, as, an, ambiguous, world, marked, by, the, displacements, and, repetitions, of, dreams, 142, 58, the, consistent, message, of, french, films, dealing, with, the, war, is, that, something, horrible, happened, but, what, happened, who, was, involved, and, why, are, left, unexplained, 142, 158, atrocities, especially, torture, by, french, forces, are, acknowledged, the, french, soldiers, who, fought, in, algeria, were, and, are, always, portrayed, in, french, cinema, as, the, lost, soldiers, and, tragic, victims, of, the, war, who, are, more, deserving, of, sympathy, than, the, fln, people, they, tortured, which, are, almost, invariably, portrayed, as, vicious, psychopathic, terrorists, an, approach, to, the, war, that, has, raised, anger, in, algeria, 151, 6, from, time, to, time, the, memory, of, the, algerian, war, surfaced, in, france, in, 1987, when, ss, hauptsturmf, hrer, klaus, barbie, the, butcher, of, lyon, was, brought, to, trial, for, crimes, against, humanity, graffiti, appeared, on, the, walls, of, the, banlieues, the, slum, districts, in, which, most, algerian, immigrants, in, france, live, reading, barbie, in, france, when, will, massu, be, in, algeria, 230, barbie, s, lawyer, jacques, verg, s, adopted, a, tu, quoque, defence, that, asked, the, judges, is, a, crime, against, humanity, is, to, be, defined, as, only, one, of, nazis, against, the, jews, or, if, it, applies, to, more, seriously, crimes, the, crimes, of, imperialists, against, people, struggling, for, their, independence, he, went, on, to, say, that, nothing, that, his, client, had, done, against, the, french, resistance, that, was, not, done, by, certain, french, officers, in, algeria, who, verg, s, noted, could, not, be, prosecuted, because, of, de, gaulle, s, amnesty, of, 1962, 230, in, 1997, when, maurice, papon, a, career, french, civil, servant, was, brought, to, trial, for, crimes, against, humanity, for, sending, 1600, jews, from, bordeaux, to, be, killed, at, auschwitz, in, 1942, it, emerged, over, the, course, of, the, trial, that, on, 17, october, 1961, papon, had, organized, a, massacre, of, between, 100, and, 200, algerians, in, central, paris, which, was, the, first, time, that, most, french, had, ever, heard, of, the, massacre, 231, the, revelation, that, hundreds, of, people, had, been, killed, by, the, paris, s, ret, was, a, great, shock, in, france, and, led, to, uncomfortable, questions, being, raised, about, what, had, happened, during, the, algerian, war, 231, the, american, historian, william, cohen, wrote, that, the, papon, trial, sharpened, the, focus, on, the, algerian, war, but, not, provide, clarity, as, papon, s, role, as, a, civil, servant, under, vichy, led, to, misleading, conclusions, in, france, that, it, was, former, collaborators, who, were, responsible, for, the, terror, in, algeria, but, most, of, the, men, responsible, like, guy, mollet, general, marcel, bigeard, robert, lacoste, general, jacques, massu, and, jacques, soustelle, had, actually, all, been, r, sistants, in, world, war, ii, which, many, french, historians, found, to, be, very, unpalatable, 231, on, 15, june, 2000, le, monde, published, an, interview, with, louisette, ighilahriz, a, former, fln, member, who, described, in, graphic, detail, her, torture, at, the, hands, of, the, french, army, and, made, the, sensational, claim, that, the, war, heroes, general, jacques, massu, and, general, marcel, bigeard, had, personally, been, present, when, she, was, being, tortured, for, information, 233, what, made, the, interview, very, touching, for, many, french, people, was, that, ighilahriz, was, not, demanding, vengeance, but, wished, to, express, thanks, to, dr, fran, ois, richaud, the, army, doctor, who, extended, her, much, kindness, and, who, she, believed, saved, her, life, by, treating, her, every, time, she, was, tortured, she, asked, if, it, were, possible, for, her, to, see, dr, richaud, one, last, time, to, thank, him, personally, but, it, later, turned, out, that, dr, richaud, had, died, in, 1997, 233, as, ighilahriz, had, been, an, attractive, woman, in, her, youth, university, educated, secular, fluent, in, french, and, fond, of, quoting, victor, hugo, and, her, duties, in, the, fln, had, been, as, an, information, courier, she, made, for, a, most, sympathetic, victim, since, she, was, a, woman, who, did, not, come, across, as, algerian, 234, william, cohen, commented, that, had, she, been, an, uneducated, man, who, had, been, involved, in, killings, and, was, not, coming, forward, to, express, thanks, for, a, frenchman, her, story, might, not, had, resonated, the, same, way, 234, the, ighiahriz, case, led, to, a, public, letter, signed, by, 12, people, who, been, involved, in, the, war, to, president, jacques, chirac, to, ask, october, 31, be, made, a, public, day, of, remembrance, for, victims, of, torture, in, algeria, 234, in, response, to, the, ighilahriz, case, general, paul, aussaresses, gave, an, interview, on, 23, november, 2000, in, which, he, candidly, admitted, to, ordering, torture, and, extrajudicial, executions, and, stated, he, had, personally, executed, 24, fellagha, he, argued, that, they, were, justified, as, torture, and, extrajudicial, executions, were, the, only, way, to, defeat, the, fln, 235, in, may, 2001, aussaresses, published, his, memoirs, services, sp, ciaux, alg, rie, 1955, 1957, in, which, presented, a, detailed, account, of, torture, and, extrajudicial, killings, in, the, name, of, the, republic, which, he, wrote, were, all, done, under, orders, from, paris, that, confirmed, what, had, been, long, suspected, 239, as, a, result, of, the, interviews, and, aussaresses, s, book, the, algerian, war, was, finally, extensively, discussed, by, the, french, media, which, had, ignored, the, subject, as, much, as, possible, for, decades, but, no, consensus, emerged, about, how, to, best, remember, the, war, 235, adding, to, the, interest, was, the, decision, by, one, war, veteran, georges, fogel, to, come, forward, to, confirm, that, he, had, seen, ighiahriz, and, many, others, tortured, in, 1957, and, the, politician, and, war, veteran, jean, marie, faure, decided, in, february, 2001, to, release, extracts, from, the, diary, that, he, had, kept, and, showed, acts, of, sadism, and, horror, that, he, had, witnessed, 235, the, french, historian, pierre, vidal, naquet, called, that, a, moment, of, catharsis, that, was, explainable, only, in, near, french, terms, it, is, the, return, of, the, repressed, 235, 6, in, 2002, une, vie, debout, m, moires, politiques, by, mohammed, harbi, a, former, advisor, to, ben, bella, was, published, in, which, harbi, wrote, because, they, weren, t, supported, at, the, moment, of, their, arrival, on, the, scene, by, a, real, and, dynamic, popular, movement, they, took, power, of, the, movement, by, force, and, they, maintained, it, by, force, convinced, that, they, had, to, act, with, resolution, in, order, to, protect, themselves, against, their, enemies, they, deliberately, chose, an, authoritarian, path, the, algerian, war, remains, a, contentious, event, according, to, the, historian, benjamin, stora, one, of, the, leading, historians, on, the, war, memories, concerning, the, war, remain, fragmented, with, no, common, ground, to, speak, of, there, is, no, such, thing, as, a, history, of, the, algerian, war, there, is, just, a, multitude, of, histories, and, personal, paths, through, it, everyone, involved, considers, that, they, lived, through, it, in, their, own, way, and, any, attempt, to, understand, the, algerian, war, globally, is, immediately, rejected, by, protagonists, even, though, stora, has, counted, 3, 000, publications, in, french, on, the, war, there, still, is, no, work, produced, by, french, and, algerian, authors, co, operating, with, each, other, although, according, to, stora, there, can, no, longer, be, talk, about, a, war, without, a, name, a, number, of, problems, remain, especially, the, absence, of, sites, in, france, to, commemorate, the, war, furthermore, conflicts, have, arisen, on, an, exact, commemoration, date, to, end, the, war, although, many, sources, as, well, as, the, french, state, place, it, on, 19, march, 1962, the, vian, agreements, others, point, out, that, massacres, of, harkis, and, the, kidnapping, of, pieds, noirs, took, place, later, stora, further, points, out, the, phase, of, memorial, reconciliation, between, the, two, sides, of, the, sea, is, still, a, long, way, off, that, was, evidenced, by, the, national, assembly, s, creation, of, the, law, on, colonialism, on, 23, february, 2005, that, asserted, that, colonialism, had, overall, been, positive, alongside, a, heated, debate, in, france, the, february, 23, 2005, law, had, the, effect, of, jeopardising, the, treaty, of, friendship, that, president, chirac, was, supposed, to, sign, with, president, abdelaziz, bouteflika, which, was, no, longer, on, the, agenda, following, that, controversial, law, bouteflika, has, talked, about, a, cultural, genocide, particularly, referring, to, the, 1945, s, tif, massacre, chirac, finally, had, the, law, repealed, by, a, complex, institutional, mechanism, another, matter, concerns, the, teaching, of, the, war, as, well, as, of, colonialism, and, decolonization, particularly, in, french, secondary, schools, hence, there, is, only, one, reference, to, racism, in, a, french, textbook, one, published, by, br, al, publishers, for, terminales, students, those, passing, their, baccalaur, at, thus, many, are, not, surprised, that, the, first, to, speak, about, the, paris, massacre, of, 1961, were, music, bands, including, hip, hop, bands, such, as, the, famous, supr, me, ntm, les, arabes, dans, la, seine, or, politically, engaged, la, rumeur, indeed, the, algerian, war, is, not, even, the, subject, of, a, specific, chapter, in, the, textbook, for, terminales, henceforth, benjamin, stora, stated, as, algerians, do, not, appear, in, an, indigenous, condition, and, their, sub, citizens, status, as, the, history, of, nationalist, movement, is, never, evoked, as, their, being, one, of, great, figures, of, the, resistance, such, as, messali, hadj, and, ferhat, abbas, they, neither, emerge, nor, are, being, given, attention, no, one, is, explaining, to, students, what, colonization, has, been, we, have, prevented, students, from, understanding, why, the, decolonization, took, place, in, metropolitan, france, in, 1963, 43, of, french, algerians, lived, in, bidonvilles, shanty, towns, thus, azouz, begag, the, delegate, minister, for, equal, opportunities, wrote, an, autobiographic, novel, le, gone, du, cha, ba, about, his, experiences, while, living, in, a, bidonville, in, the, outskirts, of, lyon, it, is, impossible, to, understand, the, third, generation, of, algerian, immigrants, to, france, without, recalling, the, bicultural, experience, an, official, parliamentary, report, on, the, prevention, of, criminality, commanded, by, interior, minister, philippe, de, villepin, and, made, by, the, deputy, jacques, alain, b, nisti, claimed, bilingualism, bilinguisme, was, a, factor, of, criminality, sic, following, outcries, the, definitive, version, of, the, report, finally, made, bilingualism, an, asset, rather, than, a, fault, after, having, denied, or, downplayed, its, use, for, 40, years, france, has, finally, recognized, its, history, of, torture, but, there, was, never, an, official, proclamation, about, it, general, paul, aussaresses, was, sentenced, following, his, justification, of, the, use, of, torture, for, apology, of, war, crimes, as, they, occurred, during, wartime, france, claimed, torture, to, be, isolated, acts, instead, of, admitting, its, responsibility, for, the, frequent, use, of, torture, to, break, the, insurgents, morale, not, as, aussaresses, had, claimed, to, save, lives, by, gaining, short, term, information, which, would, stop, terrorists, the, state, now, claims, that, torture, was, a, regrettable, aberration, because, of, the, context, of, the, exceptionally, savage, war, however, academic, research, has, proved, both, theses, to, be, false, torture, in, algeria, was, engraved, in, the, colonial, act, it, is, a, normal, illustration, of, an, abnormal, system, wrote, nicolas, bancel, pascal, blanchard, and, sandrine, lemaire, who, discussed, the, phenomena, of, human, zoos, from, the, enfumades, slaughter, by, smoke, inhalation, of, the, darha, caves, in, 1844, by, aimable, p, lissier, to, the, 1945, riots, in, s, tif, guelma, and, kherrata, the, repression, in, algeria, used, the, same, methods, following, the, s, tif, massacres, other, riots, against, the, european, presence, occurred, in, guelma, batna, biskra, and, kherrata, that, resulted, in, 103, deaths, among, the, pieds, noirs, the, suppression, of, the, riots, officially, saw, 1, 500, other, deaths, but, n, bancel, p, blanchard, and, s, lemaire, estimate, the, number, to, be, between, 6, 000, and, 8, 000, note, concerning, the, audio, and, film, archives, from, the, institut, national, de, l, audiovisuel, ina, see, benjamin, stora, s, comments, on, their, politically, oriented, creation, translations, may, be, available, for, some, of, these, works, see, specific, cases, he, also, argues, that, the, least, controversial, of, all, the, numbers, put, forward, by, various, groups, are, those, concerning, the, french, soldiers, where, government, numbers, are, largely, accepted, as, sound, most, controversial, are, the, numbers, of, civilians, killed, on, this, subject, he, turns, to, the, work, of, meynier, who, citing, french, army, documents, not, the, official, number, posits, the, range, of, 55, 000, 60, 000, deaths, meynier, further, argues, that, the, best, number, to, capture, the, harkis, deaths, is, 30, 000, if, we, add, to, this, the, number, of, european, civilians, which, government, figures, posit, as, 2, 788, meynier, s, work, cited, was, meynier, gilbert, 15, may, 2024, histoire, int, rieure, du, fln, 1954, 1962, revue, d, histoire, moderne, contemporaine, 50, 4, 4, 205, 206, doi, 10,
