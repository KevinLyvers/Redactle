https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project
the, manhattan, project, was, a, research, and, development, program, undertaken, during, world, war, ii, to, produce, the, first, nuclear, weapons, it, was, led, by, the, united, states, in, collaboration, with, the, united, kingdom, and, canada, from, 1942, to, 1946, the, project, was, directed, by, major, general, leslie, groves, of, the, u, s, army, corps, of, engineers, nuclear, physicist, j, robert, oppenheimer, was, the, director, of, the, los, alamos, laboratory, that, designed, the, bombs, the, army, program, was, designated, the, manhattan, district, as, its, first, headquarters, were, in, manhattan, the, name, gradually, superseded, the, official, codename, development, of, substitute, materials, for, the, entire, project, the, project, absorbed, its, earlier, british, counterpart, tube, alloys, and, subsumed, the, program, from, the, american, civilian, office, of, scientific, research, and, development, the, manhattan, project, employed, nearly, 130, 000, people, at, its, peak, and, cost, nearly, us, 2, billion, equivalent, to, about, 27, billion, in, 2023, over, 80, percent, of, which, was, for, building, and, operating, the, plants, that, produced, the, fissile, material, research, and, production, took, place, at, more, than, 30, sites, across, the, us, the, uk, and, canada, the, project, resulted, in, two, types, of, atomic, bombs, developed, concurrently, during, the, war, a, relatively, simple, gun, type, fission, weapon, and, a, more, complex, implosion, type, nuclear, weapon, the, thin, man, gun, type, design, proved, impractical, to, use, with, plutonium, so, a, simpler, gun, type, design, called, little, boy, was, developed, that, used, uranium, 235, three, methods, were, employed, for, uranium, enrichment, electromagnetic, gaseous, and, thermal, in, parallel, with, the, work, on, uranium, was, an, effort, to, produce, plutonium, after, the, feasibility, of, the, world, s, first, artificial, nuclear, reactor, the, chicago, pile, 1, was, demonstrated, in, 1942, at, the, metallurgical, laboratory, in, the, university, of, chicago, the, project, designed, the, x, 10, graphite, reactor, and, the, production, reactors, at, the, hanford, site, in, which, uranium, was, irradiated, and, transmuted, into, plutonium, the, fat, man, plutonium, implosion, type, weapon, was, developed, in, a, concerted, design, and, development, effort, by, the, los, alamos, laboratory, the, project, was, also, charged, with, gathering, intelligence, on, the, german, nuclear, weapon, project, through, operation, alsos, manhattan, project, personnel, served, in, europe, sometimes, behind, enemy, lines, where, they, gathered, nuclear, materials, and, documents, and, rounded, up, german, scientists, despite, the, manhattan, project, s, emphasis, on, security, soviet, atomic, spies, penetrated, the, program, the, first, nuclear, device, ever, detonated, was, an, implosion, type, bomb, during, the, trinity, test, conducted, at, white, sands, proving, ground, in, new, mexico, on, 16, july, 1945, little, boy, and, fat, man, bombs, were, used, a, month, later, in, the, atomic, bombings, of, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, in, the, immediate, postwar, years, the, manhattan, project, conducted, weapons, testing, at, bikini, atoll, as, part, of, operation, crossroads, developed, new, weapons, promoted, the, development, of, the, network, of, national, laboratories, supported, medical, research, into, radiology, and, laid, the, foundations, for, the, nuclear, navy, it, maintained, control, over, american, atomic, weapons, research, and, production, until, the, formation, of, the, united, states, atomic, energy, commission, unaec, in, january, 1947, the, discovery, of, nuclear, fission, by, otto, hahn, and, fritz, strassmann, in, 1938, and, its, theoretical, explanation, by, lise, meitner, and, otto, frisch, made, an, atomic, bomb, theoretically, possible, there, were, fears, that, a, german, atomic, bomb, project, would, develop, one, first, especially, among, scientists, who, were, refugees, from, nazi, germany, and, other, fascist, countries, in, august, 1939, hungarian, born, physicists, leo, szilard, and, eugene, wigner, drafted, the, einstein, szilard, letter, which, warned, of, the, potential, development, of, extremely, powerful, bombs, of, a, new, type, it, urged, the, united, states, to, acquire, stockpiles, of, uranium, ore, and, accelerate, the, research, of, enrico, fermi, and, others, into, nuclear, chain, reactions, they, had, it, signed, by, albert, einstein, and, delivered, to, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, roosevelt, called, on, lyman, briggs, of, the, national, bureau, of, standards, to, head, an, advisory, committee, on, uranium, briggs, met, with, szilard, wigner, and, edward, teller, in, october, 1939, the, committee, reported, back, to, roosevelt, in, november, that, uranium, would, provide, a, possible, source, of, bombs, with, a, destructiveness, vastly, greater, than, anything, now, known, in, february, 1940, the, u, s, navy, awarded, columbia, university, 6, 000, most, of, which, fermi, and, szilard, spent, on, graphite, a, team, of, columbia, professors, including, fermi, szilard, eugene, t, booth, and, john, dunning, created, the, first, nuclear, fission, reaction, in, the, americas, verifying, the, work, of, hahn, and, strassmann, the, same, team, subsequently, built, a, series, of, prototype, nuclear, reactors, or, piles, as, fermi, called, them, in, pupin, hall, at, columbia, but, were, not, yet, able, to, achieve, a, chain, reaction, the, advisory, committee, on, uranium, became, the, national, defense, research, committee, ndrc, on, uranium, when, that, organization, was, formed, on, 27, june, 1940, on, 28, june, 1941, roosevelt, signed, executive, order, 8807, which, created, the, office, of, scientific, research, and, development, osrd, under, director, vannevar, bush, the, office, was, empowered, to, engage, in, research, and, large, engineering, projects, the, ndrc, committee, on, uranium, became, the, s, 1, section, of, the, osrd, the, word, uranium, was, dropped, for, security, reasons, in, july, 1941, briggs, proposed, spending, 167, 000, on, researching, uranium, particularly, the, uranium, 235, isotope, and, plutonium, which, had, been, isolated, for, the, first, time, at, the, university, of, california, in, february, 1941, in, britain, frisch, and, rudolf, peierls, at, the, university, of, birmingham, had, made, a, breakthrough, investigating, the, critical, mass, of, uranium, 235, in, june, 1939, their, calculations, indicated, that, it, was, within, an, order, of, magnitude, of, 10, kilograms, 22, lb, small, enough, to, be, carried, by, contemporary, bombers, their, march, 1940, frisch, peierls, memorandum, initiated, the, british, atomic, bomb, project, and, its, maud, committee, which, unanimously, recommended, pursuing, the, development, of, an, atomic, bomb, in, july, 1940, britain, had, offered, to, give, the, united, states, access, to, its, research, and, the, tizard, mission, s, john, cockcroft, briefed, american, scientists, on, british, developments, he, discovered, that, the, american, project, was, smaller, than, the, british, and, not, as, advanced, as, part, of, the, scientific, exchange, the, maud, committee, s, findings, were, conveyed, to, the, united, states, one, of, its, members, the, australian, physicist, mark, oliphant, flew, to, the, us, in, late, august, 1941, and, discovered, that, data, provided, by, the, maud, committee, had, not, reached, key, american, physicists, oliphant, set, out, to, find, out, why, the, committee, s, findings, were, apparently, being, ignored, he, met, with, the, uranium, committee, and, visited, berkeley, california, where, he, spoke, persuasively, to, ernest, o, lawrence, lawrence, was, sufficiently, impressed, to, commence, his, own, research, into, uranium, he, in, turn, spoke, to, james, b, conant, arthur, h, compton, and, george, b, pegram, oliphant, s, mission, was, therefore, a, success, key, american, physicists, were, now, aware, of, the, potential, power, of, an, atomic, bomb, on, 9, october, 1941, president, roosevelt, approved, the, atomic, program, after, he, convened, a, meeting, with, vannevar, bush, and, vice, president, henry, a, wallace, he, created, a, top, policy, group, consisting, of, himself, although, he, never, attended, a, meeting, wallace, bush, conant, secretary, of, war, henry, l, stimson, and, the, chief, of, staff, of, the, army, general, george, c, marshall, roosevelt, chose, the, army, to, run, the, project, rather, than, the, navy, because, the, army, had, more, experience, with, managing, large, scale, construction, he, agreed, to, coordinate, the, effort, with, the, british, and, on, 11, october, sent, a, message, to, prime, minister, winston, churchill, suggesting, that, they, correspond, on, atomic, matters, the, s, 1, committee, meeting, on, 18, december, 1941, was, pervaded, by, an, atmosphere, of, enthusiasm, and, urgency, in, the, wake, of, the, attack, on, pearl, harbor, and, the, united, states, declaration, of, war, on, japan, and, on, germany, work, was, proceeding, on, three, techniques, for, isotope, separation, lawrence, and, his, team, at, the, university, of, california, investigated, electromagnetic, separation, eger, murphree, and, jesse, wakefield, beams, s, team, looked, into, gaseous, diffusion, at, columbia, university, and, philip, abelson, directed, research, into, thermal, diffusion, at, the, carnegie, institution, of, washington, and, later, the, naval, research, laboratory, murphree, also, headed, an, unsuccessful, separation, project, using, gas, centrifuges, meanwhile, there, were, two, lines, of, investigation, into, nuclear, reactor, technology, harold, urey, researched, heavy, water, at, columbia, while, arthur, compton, organized, the, metallurgical, laboratory, in, early, 1942, to, study, plutonium, and, reactors, using, graphite, as, a, neutron, moderator, the, s, 1, committee, recommended, pursuing, all, five, technologies, this, was, approved, by, bush, conant, and, brigadier, general, wilhelm, d, styer, who, had, been, designated, the, army, s, representative, on, nuclear, matters, bush, and, conant, then, took, the, recommendation, to, the, top, policy, group, with, a, budget, proposal, for, 54, million, for, construction, by, the, united, states, army, corps, of, engineers, 31, million, for, research, and, development, by, osrd, and, 5, million, for, contingencies, in, fiscal, year, 1943, they, sent, it, on, 17, june, 1942, to, the, president, who, approved, it, by, writing, ok, fdr, on, the, document, compton, asked, theoretical, physicist, j, robert, oppenheimer, of, the, university, of, california, to, take, over, research, into, fast, neutron, calculations, key, to, calculations, of, critical, mass, and, weapon, detonation, from, gregory, breit, who, had, quit, on, 18, may, 1942, because, of, concerns, over, lax, operational, security, john, h, manley, a, physicist, at, the, metallurgical, laboratory, was, assigned, to, assist, oppenheimer, by, coordinating, experimental, physics, groups, scattered, across, the, country, oppenheimer, and, robert, serber, of, the, university, of, illinois, examined, the, problems, of, neutron, diffusion, how, neutrons, moved, in, a, nuclear, chain, reaction, and, hydrodynamics, how, the, explosion, produced, by, a, chain, reaction, might, behave, to, review, this, work, and, the, general, theory, of, fission, reactions, oppenheimer, and, fermi, convened, meetings, at, the, university, of, chicago, in, june, and, at, the, university, of, california, in, july, 1942, with, theoretical, physicists, hans, bethe, john, van, vleck, edward, teller, emil, konopinski, robert, serber, stan, frankel, and, eldred, c, carlyle, nelson, and, experimental, physicists, emilio, segr, felix, bloch, franco, rasetti, manley, and, edwin, mcmillan, they, tentatively, confirmed, that, a, fission, bomb, was, theoretically, possible, the, properties, of, pure, uranium, 235, were, relatively, unknown, as, were, those, of, plutonium, which, had, only, been, isolated, by, glenn, seaborg, and, his, team, in, february, 1941, the, scientists, at, the, july, 1942, conference, envisioned, creating, plutonium, in, nuclear, reactors, where, uranium, 238, atoms, absorbed, neutrons, that, had, been, emitted, from, fissioning, uranium, 235, at, this, point, no, reactor, had, been, built, and, only, tiny, quantities, of, plutonium, were, available, from, cyclotrons, even, by, december, 1943, only, two, milligrams, had, been, produced, there, were, many, ways, of, arranging, the, fissile, material, into, a, critical, mass, the, simplest, was, shooting, a, cylindrical, plug, into, a, sphere, of, active, material, with, a, tamper, dense, material, to, focus, neutrons, inward, and, keep, the, reacting, mass, together, to, increase, its, efficiency, they, also, explored, designs, involving, spheroids, a, primitive, form, of, implosion, suggested, by, richard, c, tolman, and, the, possibility, of, autocatalytic, methods, to, increase, the, efficiency, of, the, bomb, as, it, exploded, as, the, idea, of, the, fission, bomb, was, theoretically, settled, at, least, until, more, experimental, data, was, available, edward, teller, pushed, for, discussion, of, a, more, powerful, bomb, the, super, now, usually, referred, to, as, a, hydrogen, bomb, which, would, use, the, force, of, a, detonating, fission, bomb, to, ignite, a, nuclear, fusion, reaction, in, deuterium, and, tritium, teller, proposed, scheme, after, scheme, but, bethe, refused, each, one, the, fusion, idea, was, put, aside, to, concentrate, on, producing, fission, bombs, teller, raised, the, speculative, possibility, that, an, atomic, bomb, might, ignite, the, atmosphere, because, of, a, hypothetical, fusion, reaction, of, nitrogen, nuclei, bethe, calculated, that, it, was, extremely, unlikely, a, postwar, report, co, authored, by, teller, concluded, that, whatever, the, temperature, to, which, a, section, of, the, atmosphere, may, be, heated, no, self, propagating, chain, of, nuclear, reactions, is, likely, to, be, started, in, serber, s, account, oppenheimer, mentioned, the, possibility, of, this, scenario, to, arthur, compton, who, didn, t, have, enough, sense, to, shut, up, about, it, it, somehow, got, into, a, document, that, went, to, washington, and, was, never, laid, to, rest, the, chief, of, engineers, major, general, eugene, reybold, selected, colonel, james, c, marshall, to, head, the, army, s, part, of, the, project, in, june, 1942, marshall, created, a, liaison, office, in, washington, d, c, but, established, his, temporary, headquarters, at, 270, broadway, in, new, york, where, he, could, draw, on, administrative, support, from, the, corps, of, engineers, north, atlantic, division, it, was, close, to, the, manhattan, office, of, stone, webster, the, principal, project, contractor, and, to, columbia, university, he, had, permission, to, draw, on, his, former, command, the, syracuse, district, for, staff, and, he, started, with, lieutenant, colonel, kenneth, nichols, who, became, his, deputy, because, most, of, his, task, involved, construction, marshall, worked, in, cooperation, with, the, head, of, the, corps, of, engineers, construction, division, major, general, thomas, m, robbins, and, his, deputy, colonel, leslie, groves, reybold, somervell, and, styer, decided, to, call, the, project, development, of, substitute, materials, but, groves, felt, that, this, would, draw, attention, since, engineer, districts, normally, carried, the, name, of, the, city, where, they, were, located, marshall, and, groves, agreed, to, name, the, army, s, component, the, manhattan, district, reybold, officially, created, this, district, on, 13, august, informally, it, was, known, as, the, manhattan, engineer, district, or, med, unlike, other, districts, it, had, no, geographic, boundaries, and, marshall, had, the, authority, of, a, division, engineer, development, of, substitute, materials, remained, as, the, official, codename, of, the, project, as, a, whole, but, was, supplanted, over, time, by, manhattan, marshall, later, conceded, that, i, had, never, heard, of, atomic, fission, but, i, did, know, that, you, could, not, build, much, of, a, plant, much, less, four, of, them, for, 90, million, a, single, tnt, plant, that, nichols, had, recently, built, in, pennsylvania, had, cost, 128, million, nor, were, they, impressed, with, estimates, to, the, nearest, order, of, magnitude, which, groves, compared, with, telling, a, caterer, to, prepare, for, between, ten, and, a, thousand, guests, a, survey, team, from, stone, webster, had, already, scouted, a, site, for, the, production, plants, the, war, production, board, recommended, sites, around, knoxville, tennessee, an, isolated, area, where, the, tennessee, valley, authority, could, supply, ample, electric, power, and, the, rivers, could, provide, cooling, water, for, the, reactors, after, examining, several, sites, the, survey, team, selected, one, near, elza, tennessee, conant, advised, that, it, be, acquired, at, once, and, styer, agreed, but, marshall, temporized, awaiting, the, results, of, conant, s, reactor, experiments, of, the, prospective, processes, only, lawrence, s, electromagnetic, separation, appeared, sufficiently, advanced, for, construction, to, commence, marshall, and, nichols, began, assembling, the, necessary, resources, the, first, step, was, to, obtain, a, high, priority, rating, for, the, project, the, top, ratings, were, aa, 1, through, aa, 4, in, descending, order, although, there, was, a, special, aaa, rating, reserved, for, emergencies, ratings, aa, 1, and, aa, 2, were, for, essential, weapons, and, equipment, so, colonel, lucius, d, clay, the, deputy, chief, of, staff, at, services, and, supply, for, requirements, and, resources, felt, that, the, highest, rating, he, could, assign, was, aa, 3, although, he, was, willing, to, provide, a, aaa, rating, on, request, for, critical, materials, if, the, need, arose, nichols, and, marshall, were, disappointed, aa, 3, was, the, same, priority, as, nichols, tnt, plant, in, pennsylvania, vannevar, bush, became, dissatisfied, with, colonel, marshall, s, failure, to, get, the, project, moving, forward, expeditiously, and, felt, that, more, aggressive, leadership, was, required, he, spoke, to, harvey, bundy, and, generals, marshall, somervell, and, styer, about, his, concerns, advocating, that, the, project, be, placed, under, a, senior, policy, committee, with, a, prestigious, officer, preferably, styer, as, director, somervell, and, styer, selected, groves, for, the, post, general, marshall, ordered, that, he, be, promoted, to, brigadier, general, as, it, was, felt, that, the, title, general, would, hold, more, sway, with, the, academic, scientists, working, on, the, project, groves, orders, placed, him, directly, under, somervell, rather, than, reybold, with, colonel, marshall, now, answerable, to, groves, groves, established, his, headquarters, in, washington, d, c, in, the, new, war, department, building, where, colonel, marshall, had, his, liaison, office, he, assumed, command, of, the, manhattan, project, on, 23, september, 1942, later, that, day, he, attended, a, meeting, called, by, stimson, which, established, a, military, policy, committee, responsible, to, the, top, policy, group, consisting, of, bush, with, conant, as, an, alternate, styer, and, rear, admiral, william, r, purnell, tolman, and, conant, were, later, appointed, as, groves, scientific, advisers, on, 19, september, groves, went, to, donald, nelson, the, chairman, of, the, war, production, board, and, asked, for, broad, authority, to, issue, a, aaa, rating, whenever, it, was, required, nelson, initially, balked, but, quickly, caved, in, when, groves, threatened, to, go, to, the, president, groves, promised, not, to, use, the, aaa, rating, unless, it, was, necessary, it, soon, transpired, that, for, the, routine, requirements, of, the, project, the, aaa, rating, was, too, high, but, the, aa, 3, rating, was, too, low, after, a, long, campaign, groves, finally, received, aa, 1, authority, on, 1, july, 1944, according, to, groves, in, washington, you, became, aware, of, the, importance, of, top, priority, most, everything, proposed, in, the, roosevelt, administration, would, have, top, priority, that, would, last, for, about, a, week, or, two, and, then, something, else, would, get, top, priority, one, of, groves, early, problems, was, to, find, a, director, for, project, y, the, group, that, would, design, and, build, the, bomb, the, obvious, choice, was, one, of, the, three, laboratory, heads, urey, lawrence, or, compton, but, they, could, not, be, spared, compton, recommended, oppenheimer, who, was, already, intimately, familiar, with, the, bomb, design, concepts, however, oppenheimer, had, little, administrative, experience, and, unlike, urey, lawrence, and, compton, had, not, won, a, nobel, prize, which, many, scientists, felt, that, the, head, of, such, an, important, laboratory, should, have, there, were, also, concerns, about, oppenheimer, s, security, status, as, many, of, his, associates, were, communists, including, his, wife, kitty, his, girlfriend, jean, tatlock, and, his, brother, frank, a, long, conversation, in, october, 1942, convinced, groves, and, nichols, that, oppenheimer, thoroughly, understood, the, issues, involved, in, setting, up, a, laboratory, in, a, remote, area, and, should, be, appointed, as, its, director, groves, personally, waived, the, security, requirements, and, issued, oppenheimer, s, clearance, on, 20, july, 1943, the, british, and, americans, exchanged, nuclear, information, but, did, not, initially, combine, their, efforts, during, 1940, 41, the, british, project, tube, alloys, was, larger, and, more, advanced, britain, rebuffed, attempts, by, bush, and, conant, in, august, 1941, to, strengthen, cooperation, because, it, was, reluctant, to, share, its, technological, lead, and, help, the, united, states, develop, its, own, atomic, bomb, but, the, british, who, had, made, significant, advances, in, research, early, in, the, war, did, not, have, the, resources, to, carry, through, such, a, research, program, into, development, while, a, large, portion, of, their, economy, was, engaged, in, fighting, the, war, tube, alloys, soon, fell, behind, its, american, counterpart, the, roles, of, the, two, countries, were, reversed, and, in, january, 1943, conant, notified, the, british, that, they, would, no, longer, receive, atomic, information, except, in, certain, areas, the, british, investigated, the, possibility, of, an, independent, nuclear, program, but, determined, that, it, could, not, be, ready, in, time, to, impact, the, war, in, europe, by, march, 1943, conant, decided, that, james, chadwick, and, one, or, two, other, british, scientists, were, important, enough, that, the, bomb, design, team, at, los, alamos, needed, them, despite, the, risk, of, revealing, weapon, design, secrets, in, august, 1943, churchill, and, roosevelt, negotiated, the, quebec, agreement, which, established, the, combined, policy, committee, to, coordinate, the, efforts, of, the, us, and, uk, canada, was, not, a, signatory, but, the, agreement, provided, for, a, canadian, representative, on, the, combined, policy, committee, in, view, of, canada, s, contribution, to, the, effort, an, agreement, between, roosevelt, and, churchill, known, as, the, hyde, park, aide, m, moire, signed, in, late, september, 1944, extended, the, quebec, agreement, to, the, postwar, period, and, suggested, that, when, a, bomb, is, finally, available, it, might, perhaps, after, mature, consideration, be, used, against, the, japanese, who, should, be, warned, that, this, bombardment, will, be, repeated, until, they, surrender, when, cooperation, resumed, after, the, quebec, agreement, the, americans, progress, and, expenditures, amazed, the, british, chadwick, pressed, for, british, involvement, in, the, manhattan, project, to, the, fullest, extent, and, abandoned, hopes, of, an, independent, british, project, during, the, war, with, churchill, s, backing, he, attempted, to, ensure, that, every, request, from, groves, for, assistance, was, honored, the, british, mission, that, arrived, in, the, united, states, in, december, 1943, included, niels, bohr, otto, frisch, klaus, fuchs, rudolf, peierls, and, ernest, titterton, more, scientists, arrived, in, early, 1944, while, those, assigned, to, gaseous, diffusion, left, by, the, fall, of, 1944, the, thirty, five, working, under, oliphant, with, lawrence, at, berkeley, were, assigned, to, existing, laboratory, groups, and, most, stayed, until, the, end, of, the, war, the, nineteen, sent, to, los, alamos, also, joined, existing, groups, primarily, related, to, implosion, and, bomb, assembly, but, not, the, plutonium, related, ones, the, quebec, agreement, specified, that, nuclear, weapons, would, not, be, used, against, another, country, without, the, mutual, consent, of, the, us, and, uk, in, june, 1945, wilson, agreed, that, the, nuclear, bombing, of, japan, would, be, recorded, as, a, decision, of, the, combined, policy, committee, the, combined, policy, committee, created, the, combined, development, trust, in, june, 1944, with, groves, as, its, chairman, to, procure, uranium, and, thorium, ores, on, international, markets, the, belgian, congo, and, canada, held, much, of, the, world, s, uranium, outside, eastern, europe, and, the, belgian, government, in, exile, was, in, london, britain, agreed, to, give, the, united, states, most, of, the, belgian, ore, as, it, could, not, use, most, of, the, supply, without, restricted, american, research, in, 1944, the, trust, purchased, 3, 440, 000, pounds, 1, 560, 000, kg, of, uranium, oxide, ore, from, companies, operating, mines, in, the, belgian, congo, to, avoid, briefing, us, secretary, of, the, treasury, henry, morgenthau, jr, a, special, account, not, subject, to, the, usual, auditing, and, controls, was, used, to, hold, trust, monies, between, 1944, and, his, resignation, from, the, trust, in, 1947, groves, deposited, a, total, of, 37, 5, million, groves, appreciated, the, early, british, atomic, research, and, the, british, scientists, contributions, to, the, manhattan, project, but, stated, that, the, united, states, would, have, succeeded, without, them, although, not, in, time, for, the, august, 1945, bombing, of, hiroshima, the, british, wartime, participation, was, crucial, to, the, success, of, the, united, kingdom, s, independent, nuclear, weapons, program, after, the, war, when, the, mcmahon, act, of, 1946, temporarily, ended, american, nuclear, cooperation, the, day, after, he, took, over, the, project, groves, went, to, tennessee, with, colonel, marshall, to, inspect, the, proposed, site, there, and, groves, was, impressed, on, 29, september, 1942, united, states, under, secretary, of, war, robert, p, patterson, authorized, the, corps, of, engineers, to, acquire, 56, 000, acres, 23, 000, ha, of, land, by, eminent, domain, at, a, cost, of, 3, 5, million, an, additional, 3, 000, acres, 1, 200, ha, was, subsequently, acquired, about, 1, 000, families, were, affected, by, the, order, which, came, into, effect, on, 7, october, protests, legal, appeals, and, a, 1943, congressional, inquiry, were, to, no, avail, by, mid, november, u, s, marshals, were, posting, notices, to, vacate, on, farmhouse, doors, and, construction, contractors, were, moving, in, some, families, were, given, two, weeks, notice, to, vacate, farms, that, had, been, their, homes, for, generations, the, ultimate, cost, of, the, land, acquisition, which, was, not, completed, until, march, 1945, was, only, about, 2, 6, million, around, 47, an, acre, when, presented, with, a, proclamation, declaring, oak, ridge, a, total, exclusion, area, that, no, one, could, enter, without, military, permission, the, governor, of, tennessee, prentice, cooper, angrily, tore, it, up, initially, known, as, the, kingston, demolition, range, the, site, was, officially, renamed, the, clinton, engineer, works, cew, in, early, 1943, while, stone, webster, concentrated, on, the, production, facilities, the, architectural, and, engineering, firm, skidmore, owings, merrill, developed, a, residential, community, for, 13, 000, the, community, was, located, on, the, slopes, of, black, oak, ridge, from, which, the, new, town, of, oak, ridge, got, its, name, the, army, presence, at, oak, ridge, increased, in, august, 1943, when, nichols, replaced, marshall, as, head, of, the, manhattan, engineer, district, one, of, his, first, tasks, was, to, move, the, district, headquarters, to, oak, ridge, although, the, name, of, the, district, did, not, change, in, september, 1943, the, administration, of, community, facilities, was, outsourced, to, turner, construction, company, through, a, subsidiary, the, roane, anderson, company, chemical, engineers, were, part, of, frantic, efforts, to, make, 10, to, 12, enriched, uranium, 235, with, tight, security, and, fast, approvals, for, supplies, and, materials, the, population, of, oak, ridge, soon, expanded, well, beyond, the, initial, plans, and, peaked, at, 75, 000, in, may, 1945, by, which, time, 82, 000, people, were, employed, at, the, clinton, engineer, works, and, 10, 000, by, roane, anderson, the, idea, of, locating, project, y, at, oak, ridge, was, considered, but, it, was, decided, that, it, should, be, in, a, remote, location, on, oppenheimer, s, recommendation, the, search, for, a, suitable, site, was, narrowed, to, the, vicinity, of, albuquerque, new, mexico, where, oppenheimer, owned, a, ranch, on, 16, november, 1942, oppenheimer, groves, dudley, and, others, toured, the, vicinity, of, the, los, alamos, ranch, school, oppenheimer, expressed, a, strong, preference, for, the, site, citing, its, natural, beauty, which, it, was, hoped, would, inspire, those, working, on, the, project, the, engineers, were, concerned, about, the, poor, access, road, and, whether, the, water, supply, would, be, adequate, but, otherwise, felt, that, it, was, ideal, patterson, approved, the, acquisition, of, the, site, on, 25, november, 1942, authorizing, 440, 000, for, the, purchase, of, pre, calculated, 54, 000, acres, 22, 000, ha, all, but, 8, 900, acres, 3, 600, ha, of, which, were, already, owned, by, the, federal, government, secretary, of, agriculture, claude, r, wickard, granted, about, 45, 000, acres, 18, 000, ha, of, united, states, forest, service, land, to, the, war, department, for, so, long, as, the, military, necessity, continues, wartime, land, purchases, eventually, came, to, 49, 383, acres, 19, 985, ha, but, only, 414, 971, was, spent, work, commenced, in, december, 1942, groves, initially, allocated, 300, 000, for, construction, three, times, oppenheimer, s, estimate, but, by, the, time, sundt, finished, on, 30, november, 1943, over, 7, million, had, been, spent, during, the, war, los, alamos, was, referred, to, as, site, y, or, the, hill, initially, it, was, to, have, been, a, military, laboratory, with, oppenheimer, and, other, researchers, commissioned, into, the, army, but, robert, bacher, and, isidor, rabi, balked, at, the, idea, and, convinced, oppenheimer, that, other, scientists, would, object, conant, groves, and, oppenheimer, then, devised, a, compromise, whereby, the, laboratory, was, operated, by, the, university, of, california, under, contract, to, the, war, department, dorothy, mckibbin, ran, the, branch, office, in, santa, fe, where, she, met, new, arrivals, and, issue, them, with, passes, an, army, osrd, council, on, 25, june, 1942, decided, to, build, a, pilot, plant, for, plutonium, production, in, the, argonne, forest, preserve, southwest, of, chicago, in, july, nichols, arranged, for, a, lease, of, 1, 025, acres, 415, ha, from, the, cook, county, forest, preserve, district, and, captain, james, f, grafton, was, appointed, chicago, area, engineer, it, soon, became, apparent, that, the, scale, of, operations, was, too, great, for, the, area, and, it, was, decided, to, build, the, pilot, plant, at, oak, ridge, and, keep, a, research, and, testing, facility, in, chicago, delays, in, establishing, the, plant, at, argonne, led, arthur, compton, to, authorize, the, metallurgical, laboratory, to, construct, the, first, nuclear, reactor, beneath, the, bleachers, of, stagg, field, at, the, university, of, chicago, the, reactor, required, an, enormous, amount, of, highly, purified, graphite, blocks, and, uranium, in, both, metallic, and, powdered, oxide, forms, at, the, time, there, was, a, limited, source, of, pure, uranium, metal, frank, spedding, of, iowa, state, university, was, able, to, produce, only, two, short, tons, three, short, tons, was, supplied, by, westinghouse, lamp, plant, produced, in, a, rush, with, makeshift, process, a, large, square, balloon, was, constructed, by, goodyear, tire, to, encase, the, reactor, on, 2, december, 1942, a, team, led, by, enrico, fermi, initiated, the, first, artificial, self, sustaining, nuclear, chain, reaction, in, an, experimental, reactor, known, as, chicago, pile, 1, the, point, at, which, a, reaction, becomes, self, sustaining, became, known, as, going, critical, compton, reported, the, success, to, conant, in, washington, d, c, by, a, coded, phone, call, saying, the, italian, navigator, has, just, landed, in, the, new, world, in, january, 1943, grafton, s, successor, major, arthur, v, peterson, ordered, chicago, pile, 1, dismantled, and, reassembled, at, the, argonne, forest, site, as, he, regarded, the, operation, of, a, reactor, as, too, hazardous, for, a, densely, populated, area, the, new, site, still, operated, by, the, metallurgical, laboratory, became, known, as, site, a, chicago, pile, 3, the, first, heavy, water, reactor, also, went, critical, at, this, site, on, 15, may, 1944, after, the, war, operations, at, site, a, were, moved, about, 6, miles, 9, 7, km, to, dupage, county, the, current, location, of, the, argonne, national, laboratory, by, december, 1942, there, were, concerns, that, even, oak, ridge, was, too, close, to, a, major, population, center, knoxville, in, the, unlikely, event, of, a, major, nuclear, accident, groves, recruited, dupont, in, november, 1942, to, be, the, prime, contractor, for, the, construction, of, the, plutonium, production, complex, the, president, of, the, company, walter, s, carpenter, jr, wanted, no, profit, of, any, kind, for, legal, reasons, a, nominal, fee, of, one, dollar, was, agreed, upon, dupont, recommended, that, the, site, be, located, far, from, the, existing, uranium, production, facility, at, oak, ridge, in, december, 1942, groves, dispatched, colonel, franklin, matthias, and, dupont, engineers, to, scout, potential, sites, matthias, reported, that, hanford, site, near, richland, washington, was, ideal, in, virtually, all, respects, it, was, isolated, and, near, the, columbia, river, which, could, supply, sufficient, water, to, cool, the, reactors, groves, visited, the, site, in, january, and, established, the, hanford, engineer, works, hew, codenamed, site, w, under, secretary, patterson, gave, his, approval, on, 9, february, allocating, 5, million, for, the, acquisition, of, 430, 000, acres, 170, 000, ha, the, federal, government, relocated, some, 1, 500, residents, of, nearby, settlements, as, well, as, the, wanapum, and, other, tribes, using, the, area, a, dispute, arose, with, farmers, over, compensation, for, crops, which, had, already, been, planted, where, schedules, allowed, the, army, allowed, the, crops, to, be, harvested, but, this, was, not, always, possible, the, land, acquisition, process, dragged, on, and, was, not, completed, before, the, end, of, the, manhattan, project, in, december, 1946, the, dispute, did, not, delay, work, although, progress, on, the, reactor, design, at, metallurgical, laboratory, and, dupont, was, not, sufficiently, advanced, to, accurately, predict, the, scope, of, the, project, a, start, was, made, in, april, 1943, on, facilities, for, an, estimated, 25, 000, workers, half, of, whom, were, expected, to, live, on, site, by, july, 1944, some, 1, 200, buildings, had, been, erected, and, nearly, 51, 000, people, were, living, in, the, construction, camp, as, area, engineer, matthias, exercised, overall, control, of, the, site, at, its, peak, the, construction, camp, was, the, third, most, populous, town, in, washington, state, hanford, operated, a, fleet, of, over, 900, buses, more, than, the, city, of, chicago, like, los, alamos, and, oak, ridge, richland, was, a, gated, community, with, restricted, access, but, it, looked, more, like, a, typical, wartime, american, boomtown, the, military, profile, was, lower, and, physical, security, elements, like, high, fences, and, guard, dogs, were, less, evident, canada, provided, research, extraction, and, production, of, uranium, and, plutonium, and, canadian, scientists, worked, at, los, alamos, cominco, had, produced, electrolytic, hydrogen, at, trail, british, columbia, since, 1930, urey, suggested, in, 1941, that, it, could, produce, heavy, water, to, the, existing, 10, million, plant, consisting, of, 3, 215, cells, consuming, 75, mw, of, hydroelectric, power, secondary, electrolysis, cells, were, added, to, increase, the, deuterium, concentration, in, the, water, from, 2, 3, to, 99, 8, for, this, process, hugh, taylor, of, princeton, developed, a, platinum, on, carbon, catalyst, for, the, first, three, stages, while, urey, developed, a, nickel, chromia, one, for, the, fourth, stage, tower, the, final, cost, was, 2, 8, million, the, canadian, government, did, not, officially, learn, of, the, project, until, august, 1942, trail, s, heavy, water, production, started, in, january, 1944, and, continued, until, 1956, heavy, water, from, trail, was, used, for, chicago, pile, 3, the, first, reactor, using, heavy, water, and, natural, uranium, which, went, critical, on, 15, may, 1944, the, chalk, river, ontario, site, was, established, to, rehouse, the, allied, effort, at, the, montreal, laboratory, away, from, an, urban, area, a, new, community, was, built, at, deep, river, ontario, to, provide, residences, and, facilities, for, the, team, members, the, site, was, chosen, for, its, proximity, to, the, industrial, manufacturing, area, of, ontario, and, quebec, and, proximity, to, a, rail, head, adjacent, to, a, large, military, base, camp, petawawa, located, on, the, ottawa, river, it, had, access, to, abundant, water, the, first, director, of, the, new, laboratory, was, hans, von, halban, he, was, replaced, by, john, cockcroft, in, may, 1944, who, was, succeeded, by, bennett, lewis, in, september, 1946, a, pilot, reactor, known, as, zeep, zero, energy, experimental, pile, became, the, first, canadian, reactor, and, the, first, to, be, completed, outside, the, united, states, when, it, went, critical, in, september, 1945, zeep, remained, in, use, by, researchers, until, 1970, a, larger, 10, mw, nrx, reactor, which, was, designed, during, the, war, was, completed, and, went, critical, in, july, 1947, the, eldorado, mine, at, port, radium, was, a, source, of, uranium, ore, although, dupont, s, preferred, designs, for, the, nuclear, reactors, were, helium, cooled, and, used, graphite, as, a, moderator, dupont, still, expressed, an, interest, in, using, heavy, water, as, a, backup, the, p, 9, project, was, the, government, s, codename, for, the, heavy, water, production, program, it, was, estimated, that, 3, short, tons, 2, 7, t, of, heavy, water, would, be, required, per, month, the, plant, at, trail, then, under, construction, could, produce, 0, 5, short, tons, 0, 45, t, per, month, groves, therefore, authorized, dupont, to, establish, heavy, water, facilities, at, the, morgantown, ordnance, works, near, morgantown, west, virginia, at, the, wabash, river, ordnance, works, near, dana, and, newport, indiana, and, at, the, alabama, ordnance, works, near, childersburg, and, sylacauga, alabama, although, known, as, ordnance, works, and, paid, for, under, ordnance, department, contracts, they, were, built, and, operated, by, the, army, corps, of, engineers, the, american, plants, used, a, process, different, from, trail, s, heavy, water, was, extracted, by, distillation, taking, advantage, of, the, slightly, higher, boiling, point, of, heavy, water, the, key, raw, material, for, the, project, was, uranium, which, was, used, as, fuel, for, the, reactors, as, feed, that, was, transformed, into, plutonium, and, in, its, enriched, form, in, the, atomic, bomb, itself, there, were, four, known, major, deposits, of, uranium, in, 1940, in, colorado, in, northern, canada, in, joachimsthal, in, czechoslovakia, and, in, the, belgian, congo, all, but, joachimstal, were, in, allied, hands, a, 1942, survey, determined, that, sufficient, quantities, of, uranium, were, available, to, satisfy, the, project, s, requirements, nichols, arranged, with, the, state, department, for, export, controls, to, be, placed, on, uranium, oxide, and, negotiated, for, the, purchase, of, 1, 200, short, tons, 1, 100, t, of, uranium, ore, from, the, belgian, congo, that, was, being, stored, in, a, warehouse, on, staten, island, and, the, remaining, stocks, of, mined, ore, stored, in, the, congo, he, negotiated, with, eldorado, gold, mines, for, the, purchase, of, ore, from, its, refinery, in, port, hope, ontario, the, canadian, government, subsequently, bought, up, the, company, s, stock, until, it, acquired, a, controlling, interest, of, these, ores, those, from, the, belgian, congo, contained, the, most, uranium, per, mass, of, rock, by, far, beyond, their, wartime, needs, american, and, british, leaders, concluded, that, it, was, in, their, countries, interest, to, control, as, much, of, the, world, s, uranium, deposits, as, possible, the, shinkolobwe, mine, was, flooded, and, closed, and, nichols, unsuccessfully, attempted, to, negotiate, its, reopening, and, the, sale, of, the, entire, future, output, to, the, united, states, with, edgar, sengier, the, director, of, the, company, that, owned, the, mine, the, union, mini, re, du, haut, katanga, the, matter, was, then, taken, up, by, the, combined, policy, committee, as, 30, percent, of, union, mini, re, s, stock, was, controlled, by, british, interests, the, british, took, the, lead, in, negotiations, sir, john, anderson, and, ambassador, john, winant, hammered, out, a, deal, with, sengier, and, the, belgian, government, in, may, 1944, for, the, mine, to, be, reopened, and, 1, 720, short, tons, 1, 560, t, of, ore, to, be, purchased, at, 1, 45, a, pound, to, avoid, dependence, on, the, british, and, canadians, for, ore, groves, also, arranged, for, the, purchase, of, us, vanadium, corporation, s, stockpile, in, uravan, colorado, the, raw, ore, was, dissolved, in, nitric, acid, to, produce, uranyl, nitrate, which, was, processed, into, uranium, trioxide, which, was, reduced, to, highly, pure, uranium, dioxide, by, july, 1942, mallinckrodt, was, producing, a, ton, of, highly, pure, oxide, a, day, but, turning, this, into, uranium, metal, initially, proved, more, difficult, production, was, too, slow, and, quality, was, unacceptably, low, a, branch, of, the, metallurgical, laboratory, was, established, at, iowa, state, college, in, ames, iowa, under, frank, spedding, to, investigate, alternatives, this, became, known, as, the, ames, project, and, its, ames, process, became, available, in, 1943, natural, uranium, consists, of, 99, 3, uranium, 238, and, 0, 7, uranium, 235, but, as, only, the, latter, is, fissile, it, must, be, physically, separated, from, the, more, plentiful, isotope, various, methods, were, considered, for, uranium, enrichment, most, of, which, was, carried, out, at, oak, ridge, the, most, obvious, technology, the, centrifuge, failed, but, electromagnetic, separation, gaseous, diffusion, and, thermal, diffusion, technologies, were, all, successful, and, contributed, to, the, project, in, february, 1943, groves, came, up, with, the, idea, of, using, the, output, of, some, plants, as, the, input, for, others, the, centrifuge, process, was, regarded, as, the, only, promising, separation, method, in, april, 1942, jesse, beams, had, developed, such, a, process, in, the, 1930s, but, had, encountered, technical, difficulties, in, 1941, he, began, working, with, uranium, hexafluoride, the, only, known, gaseous, compound, of, uranium, and, was, able, to, separate, uranium, 235, at, columbia, karl, p, cohen, produced, a, body, of, mathematical, theory, making, it, possible, to, design, a, centrifugal, separation, unit, which, westinghouse, undertook, to, construct, scaling, this, up, to, a, production, plant, presented, a, formidable, technical, challenge, urey, and, cohen, estimated, that, producing, a, kilogram, 2, 2, lb, of, uranium, 235, per, day, would, require, up, to, 50, 000, centrifuges, with, 1, meter, 3, ft, 3, in, rotors, or, 10, 000, centrifuges, with, 4, meter, 13, ft, rotors, assuming, that, 4, meter, rotors, could, be, built, the, prospect, of, keeping, so, many, rotors, operating, continuously, at, high, speed, appeared, daunting, and, when, beams, ran, his, experimental, apparatus, he, obtained, only, 60, of, the, predicted, yield, indicating, that, more, centrifuges, were, required, beams, urey, and, cohen, then, began, work, on, a, series, of, improvements, which, promised, to, increase, efficiency, however, frequent, failures, of, motors, shafts, and, bearings, at, high, speeds, delayed, work, on, the, pilot, plant, in, november, 1942, the, centrifuge, process, was, abandoned, by, the, military, policy, committee, successful, gas, centrifuges, of, the, zippe, type, design, were, instead, developed, in, the, soviet, union, after, the, war, it, eventually, became, the, preferred, method, of, uranium, isotope, separation, being, far, more, economical, electromagnetic, isotope, separation, was, developed, at, the, university, of, california, radiation, laboratory, this, method, employed, devices, known, as, calutrons, the, name, was, derived, from, the, words, california, university, and, cyclotron, in, the, electromagnetic, process, a, magnetic, field, deflected, charged, particles, according, to, mass, the, process, was, neither, scientifically, elegant, nor, industrially, efficient, compared, with, a, gaseous, diffusion, plant, or, a, nuclear, reactor, an, electromagnetic, separation, plant, would, consume, more, scarce, materials, require, more, manpower, to, operate, and, cost, more, to, build, nonetheless, the, process, was, approved, because, it, was, based, on, proven, technology, and, therefore, represented, less, risk, moreover, it, could, be, built, in, stages, and, rapidly, reach, industrial, capacity, marshall, and, nichols, discovered, that, the, electromagnetic, isotope, separation, process, would, require, 5, 000, short, tons, 4, 500, tonnes, of, copper, which, was, in, desperately, short, supply, however, silver, could, be, substituted, in, an, 11, 10, copper, to, silver, ratio, on, 3, august, 1942, nichols, met, with, under, secretary, of, the, treasury, daniel, w, bell, and, asked, for, the, transfer, of, 6, 000, tons, of, silver, bullion, from, the, west, point, bullion, depository, ultimately, 14, 700, short, tons, 13, 300, tonnes, 430, 000, 000, troy, ounces, were, used, the, 1, 000, troy, ounce, 31, kg, silver, bars, were, cast, into, cylindrical, billets, extruded, into, strips, and, wound, onto, magnetic, coils, responsibility, for, the, design, and, construction, of, the, electromagnetic, separation, plant, which, came, to, be, called, y, 12, was, assigned, to, stone, webster, in, june, 1942, the, design, called, for, five, first, stage, processing, units, known, as, alpha, racetracks, and, two, units, for, final, processing, known, as, beta, racetracks, in, september, 1943, groves, authorized, construction, of, four, more, racetracks, known, as, alpha, ii, construction, began, in, february, 1943, the, second, alpha, i, was, operational, at, the, end, of, january, 1944, the, first, beta, and, first, and, third, alpha, i, s, came, online, in, march, and, the, fourth, alpha, i, was, operational, in, april, the, four, alpha, ii, racetracks, were, completed, between, july, and, october, 1944, tennessee, eastman, was, contracted, to, manage, y, 12, the, calutrons, were, turned, over, to, trained, tennessee, eastman, operators, known, as, the, calutron, girls, the, calutrons, initially, enriched, the, uranium, 235, content, to, between, 13, and, 15, and, shipped, the, first, few, hundred, grams, of, this, to, los, alamos, in, march, 1944, only, 1, part, in, 5, 825, of, the, uranium, feed, emerged, as, product, much, of, the, rest, was, splattered, over, equipment, in, the, process, strenuous, recovery, efforts, helped, raise, production, to, 10, of, the, uranium, 235, feed, by, january, 1945, in, february, the, alpha, racetracks, began, receiving, slightly, enriched, 1, 4, feed, from, the, new, s, 50, thermal, diffusion, plant, and, the, next, month, they, received, enhanced, 5, feed, from, the, k, 25, gaseous, diffusion, plant, by, august, k, 25, was, producing, uranium, sufficiently, enriched, to, feed, directly, into, the, beta, tracks, the, most, promising, but, also, the, most, challenging, method, of, isotope, separation, was, gaseous, diffusion, graham, s, law, states, that, the, rate, of, effusion, of, a, gas, is, inversely, proportional, to, the, square, root, of, its, molecular, mass, so, in, a, box, containing, a, semi, permeable, membrane, and, a, mixture, of, two, gases, the, lighter, molecules, will, pass, out, of, the, container, more, rapidly, than, the, heavier, molecules, the, idea, was, that, such, boxes, could, be, formed, into, a, cascade, of, pumps, and, membranes, with, each, successive, stage, containing, a, slightly, more, enriched, mixture, research, into, the, process, was, carried, out, at, columbia, university, by, a, group, that, included, harold, urey, karl, p, cohen, and, john, r, dunning, in, november, 1942, the, military, policy, committee, approved, the, construction, of, a, 600, stage, gaseous, diffusion, plant, on, 14, december, m, w, kellogg, accepted, an, offer, to, construct, the, plant, which, was, codenamed, k, 25, a, separate, corporate, entity, called, kellex, was, created, for, the, project, the, process, faced, formidable, technical, difficulties, the, highly, corrosive, gas, uranium, hexafluoride, had, to, be, used, as, no, substitute, could, be, found, and, the, motors, and, pumps, had, to, be, vacuum, tight, and, enclosed, in, inert, gas, the, biggest, problem, was, the, design, of, the, barrier, which, had, to, be, strong, porous, and, resistant, to, corrosion, edward, adler, and, edward, norris, created, a, mesh, barrier, from, electroplated, nickel, a, six, stage, pilot, plant, was, built, at, columbia, to, test, the, process, but, the, prototype, proved, to, be, too, brittle, a, rival, barrier, was, developed, from, powdered, nickel, by, kellex, the, bell, telephone, laboratories, and, the, bakelite, corporation, in, january, 1944, groves, ordered, the, kellex, barrier, into, production, kellex, s, design, for, k, 25, called, for, a, four, story, 0, 5, mile, 0, 80, km, long, u, shaped, structure, containing, 54, contiguous, buildings, these, were, divided, into, nine, sections, containing, cells, of, six, stages, a, survey, party, began, construction, by, marking, out, the, 500, acre, 2, 0, km, 2, site, in, may, 1943, work, on, the, main, building, began, in, october, 1943, and, the, six, stage, pilot, plant, was, ready, for, operation, on, 17, april, 1944, in, 1945, groves, canceled, the, upper, stages, directing, kellex, to, instead, design, and, build, a, 540, stage, side, feed, unit, which, became, known, as, k, 27, kellex, transferred, the, last, unit, to, the, operating, contractor, union, carbide, and, carbon, on, 11, september, 1945, the, total, cost, including, the, k, 27, plant, completed, after, the, war, came, to, 480, million, the, production, plant, commenced, operation, in, february, 1945, and, as, cascade, after, cascade, came, online, the, quality, of, the, product, increased, by, april, 1945, k, 25, had, attained, a, 1, 1, enrichment, and, the, output, of, the, s, 50, thermal, diffusion, plant, began, being, used, as, feed, some, product, produced, the, next, month, reached, nearly, 7, enrichment, in, august, the, last, of, the, 2, 892, stages, commenced, operation, k, 25, and, k, 27, achieved, their, full, potential, in, the, early, postwar, period, when, they, eclipsed, the, other, production, plants, and, became, the, prototypes, for, a, new, generation, of, plants, the, thermal, diffusion, process, was, based, on, sydney, chapman, and, david, enskog, s, theory, which, explained, that, when, a, mixed, gas, passes, through, a, temperature, gradient, the, heavier, one, tends, to, concentrate, at, the, cold, end, and, the, lighter, one, at, the, warm, end, it, was, developed, by, us, navy, scientists, but, was, not, one, of, the, enrichment, technologies, initially, selected, for, use, in, the, manhattan, project, this, was, primarily, due, to, doubts, about, its, technical, feasibility, but, the, inter, service, rivalry, between, the, army, and, navy, also, played, a, part, the, naval, research, laboratory, continued, the, research, under, philip, abelson, s, direction, but, there, was, little, contact, with, the, manhattan, project, until, april, 1944, when, captain, william, s, parsons, the, naval, officer, in, charge, of, ordnance, development, at, los, alamos, brought, oppenheimer, news, of, encouraging, progress, on, thermal, diffusion, oppenheimer, informed, groves, who, approved, construction, of, a, thermal, plant, on, 24, june, 1944, groves, contracted, with, the, h, k, ferguson, company, of, cleveland, ohio, to, build, the, thermal, diffusion, plant, which, was, designated, s, 50, plans, called, for, the, installation, of, 2, 142, 48, foot, tall, 15, m, diffusion, columns, arranged, in, 21, racks, inside, each, column, were, three, concentric, tubes, steam, obtained, from, the, nearby, k, 25, powerhouse, at, a, pressure, of, 100, pounds, per, square, inch, 690, kpa, and, temperature, of, 545, f, 285, c, flowed, downward, through, the, innermost, 1, 25, inch, 32, mm, nickel, pipe, while, water, at, 155, f, 68, c, flowed, upward, through, the, outermost, iron, pipe, the, uranium, hexafluoride, flowed, in, the, middle, copper, pipe, and, isotope, separation, of, the, uranium, occurred, between, the, nickel, and, copper, pipes, work, commenced, on, 9, july, 1944, and, s, 50, began, partial, operation, in, september, leaks, limited, production, and, forced, shutdowns, over, the, next, few, months, but, in, june, 1945, the, s, 50, plant, produced, 12, 730, pounds, 5, 770, kg, of, slightly, enriched, product, by, march, 1945, all, 21, production, racks, were, operating, initially, the, output, of, s, 50, was, fed, into, y, 12, but, starting, in, march, 1945, all, three, enrichment, processes, were, run, in, series, s, 50, became, the, first, stage, enriching, the, uranium, from, 0, 71, to, 0, 89, uranium, 235, this, was, then, fed, into, the, gaseous, diffusion, process, in, the, k, 25, plant, which, produced, a, product, enriched, to, about, 23, in, turn, this, was, fed, into, y, 12, which, boosted, it, to, about, 89, sufficient, for, use, in, nuclear, weapons, about, 50, kilograms, 110, lb, of, uranium, enriched, to, 89, was, delivered, to, los, alamos, by, july, 1945, the, entire, 50, kg, along, with, some, 50, enriched, averaging, out, to, about, 85, enriched, were, used, in, the, first, little, boy, bomb, the, second, line, of, development, pursued, by, the, manhattan, project, used, plutonium, although, small, amounts, of, plutonium, exist, in, nature, the, best, way, to, obtain, large, quantities, is, via, a, reactor, natural, uranium, is, bombarded, by, neutrons, and, transmuted, into, uranium, 239, which, rapidly, decays, first, into, neptunium, 239, and, then, into, plutonium, 239, as, only, a, small, amount, will, be, transformed, the, plutonium, must, be, chemically, separated, from, the, remaining, uranium, from, any, initial, impurities, and, from, fission, products, in, march, 1943, dupont, began, construction, of, a, plutonium, plant, on, a, 112, acre, 0, 5, km, 2, site, at, oak, ridge, intended, as, a, pilot, plant, for, the, larger, production, facilities, at, hanford, it, included, the, air, cooled, x, 10, graphite, reactor, a, chemical, separation, plant, and, support, facilities, because, of, the, subsequent, decision, to, construct, water, cooled, reactors, at, hanford, only, the, chemical, separation, plant, operated, as, a, true, pilot, the, x, 10, graphite, reactor, consisted, of, a, huge, block, of, graphite, 24, feet, 7, 3, m, per, side, weighing, around, 1, 500, short, tons, 1, 400, t, surrounded, by, 7, feet, 2, 1, m, of, high, density, concrete, as, a, radiation, shield, the, greatest, difficulty, was, encountered, with, the, uranium, slugs, produced, by, mallinckrodt, and, metal, hydrides, these, had, to, be, coated, in, aluminum, to, avoid, corrosion, and, the, escape, of, fission, products, into, the, cooling, system, the, grasselli, chemical, company, attempted, to, develop, a, hot, dipping, process, without, success, alcoa, tried, canning, developing, a, new, process, for, flux, less, welding, 97, of, the, cans, passed, a, standard, vacuum, test, but, high, temperature, tests, indicated, a, failure, rate, of, more, than, 50, nonetheless, production, began, in, june, 1943, the, metallurgical, laboratory, eventually, developed, an, improved, welding, technique, with, the, help, of, general, electric, which, was, incorporated, into, the, production, process, in, october, 1943, the, x, 10, graphite, reactor, went, critical, on, 4, november, 1943, with, about, 30, short, tons, 27, t, of, uranium, a, week, later, the, load, was, increased, to, 36, short, tons, 33, t, raising, its, power, generation, to, 500, kw, and, by, the, end, of, the, month, the, first, 500, mg, of, plutonium, was, created, gradual, modifications, raised, the, power, to, 4, 000, kw, in, july, 1944, x, 10, operated, as, a, production, plant, until, january, 1945, when, it, was, turned, over, to, research, although, an, air, cooled, design, was, chosen, for, the, reactor, at, oak, ridge, to, facilitate, rapid, construction, this, was, impractical, for, the, much, larger, production, reactors, initial, designs, by, the, metallurgical, laboratory, and, dupont, used, helium, for, cooling, before, they, determined, that, a, water, cooled, reactor, was, simpler, cheaper, and, quicker, to, build, the, design, did, not, become, available, until, 4, october, 1943, in, the, meantime, matthias, concentrated, on, improving, the, hanford, site, by, erecting, accommodations, improving, the, roads, building, a, railway, switch, line, and, upgrading, the, electricity, water, and, telephone, lines, as, at, oak, ridge, the, most, difficulty, was, encountered, while, canning, the, uranium, slugs, which, commenced, at, hanford, in, march, 1944, they, were, pickled, to, remove, dirt, and, impurities, dipped, in, molten, bronze, tin, and, aluminum, silicon, alloy, canned, using, hydraulic, presses, and, then, capped, using, arc, welding, under, an, argon, atmosphere, finally, they, were, tested, to, detect, holes, or, faulty, welds, disappointingly, most, canned, slugs, initially, failed, the, tests, resulting, in, an, output, of, only, a, handful, per, day, but, steady, progress, was, made, and, by, june, 1944, production, increased, to, the, point, where, it, appeared, that, enough, canned, slugs, was, available, to, start, reactor, b, on, schedule, in, august, 1944, work, began, on, reactor, b, the, first, of, six, planned, 250, mw, reactors, on, 10, october, 1943, the, reactor, complexes, were, given, letter, designations, a, through, f, with, b, d, and, f, sites, developed, first, as, this, maximized, the, distance, between, the, reactors, they, were, the, only, ones, constructed, during, the, manhattan, project, some, 390, short, tons, 350, t, of, steel, 17, 400, cubic, yards, 13, 300, m, 3, of, concrete, 50, 000, concrete, blocks, and, 71, 000, concrete, bricks, were, used, to, construct, the, 120, foot, 37, m, high, building, construction, of, the, reactor, itself, commenced, in, february, 1944, watched, by, compton, matthias, dupont, s, crawford, greenewalt, leona, woods, and, fermi, who, inserted, the, first, slug, the, reactor, was, powered, up, beginning, on, 13, september, 1944, over, the, next, few, days, 838, tubes, were, loaded, and, the, reactor, went, critical, shortly, after, midnight, on, 27, september, the, operators, began, to, withdraw, the, control, rods, to, initiate, production, at, first, all, appeared, well, but, around, 03, 00, the, power, level, started, to, drop, and, by, 06, 30, the, reactor, had, shut, down, completely, the, cooling, water, was, investigated, to, see, if, there, was, a, leak, or, contamination, the, next, day, the, reactor, started, up, again, only, to, shut, down, once, more, fermi, contacted, chien, shiung, wu, who, identified, the, cause, of, the, problem, as, neutron, poisoning, from, xenon, 135, which, has, a, half, life, of, 9, 2, hours, fermi, woods, donald, j, hughes, and, john, archibald, wheeler, then, calculated, the, nuclear, cross, section, of, xenon, 135, which, turned, out, to, be, 30, 000, times, that, of, uranium, dupont, engineer, george, graves, had, deviated, from, the, metallurgical, laboratory, s, original, design, in, which, the, reactor, had, 1, 500, tubes, arranged, in, a, circle, and, had, added, an, additional, 504, tubes, to, fill, in, the, corners, the, scientists, had, originally, considered, this, overengineering, a, waste, of, time, and, money, but, fermi, realized, that, by, loading, all, 2, 004, tubes, the, reactor, could, reach, the, required, power, level, and, efficiently, produce, plutonium, reactor, d, was, started, on, 17, december, 1944, and, reactor, f, on, 25, february, 1945, meanwhile, the, chemists, considered, how, plutonium, could, be, separated, from, uranium, when, its, chemical, properties, were, not, known, working, with, the, minute, quantities, of, plutonium, available, at, the, metallurgical, laboratory, in, 1942, a, team, under, charles, m, cooper, developed, a, lanthanum, fluoride, process, which, was, chosen, for, the, pilot, separation, plant, a, second, separation, process, the, bismuth, phosphate, process, was, subsequently, developed, by, seaborg, and, stanly, g, thomson, greenewalt, favored, the, bismuth, phosphate, process, due, to, the, corrosive, nature, of, lanthanum, fluoride, and, it, was, selected, for, the, hanford, separation, plants, once, x, 10, began, producing, plutonium, the, pilot, separation, plant, was, put, to, the, test, the, first, batch, was, processed, at, 40, efficiency, but, over, the, next, few, months, this, was, raised, to, 90, at, hanford, top, priority, was, initially, given, to, the, installations, in, the, 300, area, buildings, for, testing, materials, preparing, uranium, and, assembling, and, calibrating, instrumentation, one, of, the, buildings, housed, the, canning, equipment, for, the, uranium, slugs, while, another, contained, a, small, test, reactor, notwithstanding, its, priority, work, on, the, 300, area, fell, behind, schedule, due, to, the, unique, and, complex, nature, of, the, facilities, and, wartime, shortages, of, labor, and, materials, early, plans, called, for, the, construction, of, two, separation, plants, in, each, of, the, areas, known, as, 200, west, and, 200, east, this, was, subsequently, reduced, to, two, the, t, and, u, plants, in, 200, west, and, one, the, b, plant, at, 200, east, each, separation, plant, consisted, of, four, buildings, a, process, cell, building, or, canyon, known, as, 221, a, concentration, building, 224, a, purification, building, 231, and, a, magazine, store, 213, the, canyons, were, each, 800, feet, 240, m, long, and, 65, feet, 20, m, wide, each, consisted, of, forty, 17, 7, by, 13, by, 20, foot, 5, 4, by, 4, 0, by, 6, 1, m, cells, work, began, on, 221, t, and, 221, u, in, january, 1944, with, the, former, completed, in, september, and, the, latter, in, december, the, 221, b, building, followed, in, march, 1945, because, of, the, high, levels, of, radioactivity, involved, work, in, the, separation, plants, had, to, be, conducted, by, remote, control, using, closed, circuit, television, something, unheard, of, in, 1943, maintenance, was, carried, out, with, the, aid, of, an, overhead, crane, and, specially, designed, tools, the, 224, buildings, were, smaller, because, they, had, less, material, to, process, and, it, was, less, radioactive, the, 224, t, and, 224, u, buildings, were, completed, on, 8, october, 1944, and, 224, b, followed, on, 10, february, 1945, the, purification, methods, that, were, eventually, used, in, 231, w, were, still, unknown, when, construction, commenced, on, 8, april, 1944, but, the, plant, was, complete, and, the, methods, were, selected, by, the, end, of, the, year, on, 5, february, 1945, matthias, hand, delivered, the, first, shipment, of, 80, g, of, 95, pure, plutonium, nitrate, to, a, los, alamos, courier, in, los, angeles, in, 1943, development, efforts, were, directed, to, a, gun, type, fission, weapon, with, plutonium, called, thin, man, initial, research, on, the, properties, of, plutonium, was, done, using, cyclotron, generated, plutonium, 239, which, was, extremely, pure, but, could, only, be, created, in, very, small, amounts, los, alamos, received, the, first, sample, of, plutonium, from, the, clinton, x, 10, reactor, in, april, 1944, and, within, days, emilio, segr, discovered, a, problem, the, reactor, bred, plutonium, had, a, higher, concentration, of, plutonium, 240, resulting, in, up, to, five, times, the, spontaneous, fission, rate, of, cyclotron, plutonium, this, rendered, it, unsuitable, for, use, in, a, gun, type, weapon, for, the, plutonium, 240, would, start, the, chain, reaction, too, soon, causing, a, predetonation, that, would, disperse, the, critical, mass, after, a, minimal, amount, of, plutonium, had, fissioned, a, fizzle, a, higher, velocity, gun, was, suggested, but, found, to, be, impractical, the, possibility, of, separating, the, isotopes, was, also, considered, and, rejected, as, plutonium, 240, is, even, harder, to, separate, from, plutonium, 239, than, uranium, 235, from, uranium, 238, and, attempting, it, would, postpone, the, weapon, indefinitely, work, on, an, alternative, method, of, bomb, design, known, as, implosion, had, begun, earlier, under, the, direction, of, the, physicist, seth, neddermeyer, implosion, used, explosives, to, crush, a, subcritical, sphere, of, fissile, material, into, a, smaller, and, denser, form, the, critical, mass, is, assembled, in, much, less, time, than, with, the, gun, method, when, the, fissile, atoms, are, packed, closer, together, the, rate, of, neutron, capture, increases, so, it, also, makes, more, efficient, use, of, fissionable, material, neddermeyer, s, 1943, and, early, 1944, investigations, showed, promise, but, also, made, it, clear, that, an, implosion, weapon, was, more, complex, than, the, gun, type, design, from, both, a, theoretical, and, an, engineering, perspective, in, september, 1943, john, von, neumann, who, had, experience, with, shaped, charges, proposed, using, a, spherical, configuration, instead, of, the, cylindrical, one, that, neddermeyer, was, working, on, an, accelerated, effort, on, the, implosion, design, codenamed, fat, man, began, in, august, 1944, when, oppenheimer, implemented, a, sweeping, reorganization, of, the, los, alamos, laboratory, to, focus, on, implosion, two, new, groups, were, created, at, los, alamos, to, develop, the, implosion, weapon, x, for, explosives, division, headed, by, explosives, expert, george, kistiakowsky, and, g, for, gadget, division, under, robert, bacher, the, new, design, featured, explosive, lenses, that, focused, the, implosion, into, a, spherical, shape, the, design, of, lenses, turned, out, to, be, slow, difficult, and, frustrating, various, explosives, were, tested, before, settling, on, composition, b, and, baratol, the, final, design, resembled, a, soccer, ball, with, 20, hexagonal, and, 12, pentagonal, lenses, each, weighing, about, 80, pounds, 36, kg, getting, the, detonation, just, right, required, fast, reliable, and, safe, electrical, detonators, of, which, there, were, two, for, each, lens, for, reliability, they, used, exploding, bridgewire, detonators, a, new, invention, developed, at, los, alamos, by, a, group, led, by, luis, alvarez, to, study, the, behavior, of, converging, shock, waves, robert, serber, devised, the, rala, experiment, which, used, the, short, lived, radioisotope, lanthanum, 140, a, potent, source, of, gamma, radiation, the, gamma, ray, source, was, placed, in, the, center, of, a, metal, sphere, surrounded, by, the, explosive, lenses, which, in, turn, were, inside, in, an, ionization, chamber, this, allowed, the, taking, of, an, x, ray, movie, of, the, implosion, the, lenses, were, designed, primarily, using, this, series, of, tests, in, his, history, of, the, los, alamos, project, david, hawkins, wrote, rala, became, the, most, important, single, experiment, affecting, the, final, bomb, design, within, the, explosives, was, an, aluminum, pusher, which, provided, a, smooth, transition, from, the, relatively, low, density, explosive, to, the, next, layer, the, tamper, of, natural, uranium, its, main, job, was, to, hold, the, critical, mass, together, as, long, as, possible, but, it, would, also, reflect, neutrons, into, the, core, and, some, of, its, uranium, would, fission, to, prevent, predetonation, by, an, external, neutron, the, tamper, was, coated, in, a, thin, layer, of, neutron, absorbing, boron, a, polonium, beryllium, modulated, neutron, initiator, known, as, an, urchin, was, developed, to, start, the, chain, reaction, at, precisely, the, right, moment, this, work, on, the, chemistry, and, metallurgy, of, radioactive, polonium, was, directed, by, charles, allen, thomas, of, the, monsanto, company, and, became, known, as, the, dayton, project, testing, required, up, to, 500, curies, per, month, of, polonium, which, monsanto, was, able, to, deliver, the, whole, assembly, was, encased, in, a, duralumin, bomb, casing, to, protect, it, from, bullets, and, flak, the, ultimate, task, of, the, metallurgists, was, to, determine, how, to, cast, plutonium, into, a, sphere, the, difficulties, became, apparent, when, attempts, to, measure, the, density, of, plutonium, gave, inconsistent, results, at, first, contamination, was, suspected, but, it, was, soon, determined, that, there, were, multiple, allotropes, of, plutonium, the, brittle, phase, that, exists, at, room, temperature, changes, to, the, plastic, phase, at, higher, temperatures, attention, then, shifted, to, the, even, more, malleable, phase, that, normally, exists, in, the, 300, c, to, 450, c, range, it, was, found, that, this, was, stable, at, room, temperature, when, alloyed, with, aluminum, but, aluminum, emits, neutrons, when, bombarded, with, alpha, particles, which, would, exacerbate, the, pre, ignition, problem, the, metallurgists, then, hit, upon, using, a, plutonium, gallium, alloy, which, stabilized, the, phase, and, could, be, hot, pressed, into, the, desired, spherical, shape, as, plutonium, was, found, to, corrode, readily, the, sphere, was, coated, with, nickel, the, work, proved, dangerous, by, the, end, of, the, war, half, the, chemists, and, metallurgists, had, to, be, removed, from, work, with, plutonium, when, unacceptably, high, levels, of, the, element, was, detected, in, their, urine, a, minor, fire, at, los, alamos, in, january, 1945, led, to, a, fear, that, a, fire, in, the, plutonium, laboratory, might, contaminate, the, whole, town, and, groves, authorized, the, construction, of, a, new, facility, for, plutonium, chemistry, and, metallurgy, which, became, known, as, the, dp, site, the, hemispheres, for, the, first, plutonium, pit, or, core, were, produced, and, delivered, on, 2, july, 1945, three, more, hemispheres, followed, on, 23, july, and, were, delivered, three, days, later, in, contrast, to, the, plutonium, fat, man, the, uranium, gun, type, little, boy, weapon, was, straightforward, if, not, trivial, to, design, overall, responsibility, for, it, was, assigned, to, parsons, s, ordnance, o, division, with, the, design, development, and, technical, work, at, los, alamos, consolidated, under, lieutenant, commander, francis, birch, s, group, the, gun, type, design, now, had, to, work, with, enriched, uranium, only, and, this, allowed, the, design, to, be, greatly, simplified, a, high, velocity, gun, was, no, longer, required, and, a, simpler, weapon, was, substituted, research, into, the, super, was, also, pursued, although, it, was, considered, secondary, to, the, development, of, a, fission, bomb, the, effort, was, directed, by, teller, who, was, its, most, enthusiastic, proponent, the, f, 1, super, group, calculated, that, burning, 1, cubic, meter, 35, cu, ft, of, liquid, deuterium, would, release, the, energy, of, 10, megatonnes, of, tnt, 42, pj, enough, to, devastate, 1, 000, square, miles, 2, 600, km, 2, in, a, final, report, on, the, super, in, june, 1946, teller, remained, upbeat, about, the, prospect, of, it, being, successfully, developed, although, that, opinion, was, not, universal, because, of, the, complexity, of, an, implosion, style, weapon, it, was, decided, that, despite, the, waste, of, fissile, material, a, full, scale, nuclear, test, was, required, oppenheimer, codenamed, it, trinity, in, march, 1944, planning, for, the, test, was, assigned, to, kenneth, bainbridge, who, selected, the, alamogordo, bombing, range, for, the, test, site, a, base, camp, was, constructed, with, barracks, warehouses, workshops, an, explosive, magazine, and, a, commissary, a, pre, test, explosion, was, conducted, on, 7, may, 1945, to, calibrate, the, instruments, a, wooden, test, platform, was, erected, 800, yards, 730, m, from, future, trinity, ground, zero, and, piled, with, about, 100, short, tons, 91, t, of, high, explosives, spiked, with, nuclear, fission, products, groves, did, not, relish, the, prospect, of, explaining, to, a, senate, committee, the, loss, of, a, billion, dollars, worth, of, plutonium, so, a, cylindrical, containment, vessel, codenamed, jumbo, was, constructed, to, recover, the, active, material, in, the, event, of, a, failure, it, was, fabricated, at, great, expense, from, 214, short, tons, 194, t, of, iron, and, steel, by, the, time, it, arrived, however, confidence, in, the, implosion, method, was, high, enough, and, the, availability, of, plutonium, was, sufficient, that, oppenheimer, decided, not, to, use, it, instead, it, was, placed, atop, a, steel, tower, 800, yards, 730, m, from, the, weapon, as, a, rough, measure, of, the, explosion, s, power, jumbo, survived, although, its, tower, did, not, adding, credence, to, the, belief, that, jumbo, would, have, successfully, contained, a, fizzled, explosion, for, the, actual, test, the, weapon, nicknamed, the, gadget, was, hoisted, to, the, top, of, a, 100, foot, 30, m, steel, tower, as, detonation, at, that, height, would, give, a, better, indication, of, how, the, weapon, would, behave, when, dropped, from, a, bomber, detonation, in, the, air, maximized, the, energy, applied, directly, to, the, target, and, generated, less, nuclear, fallout, the, gadget, was, assembled, under, the, supervision, of, norris, bradbury, at, the, nearby, mcdonald, ranch, house, on, 13, july, and, precariously, winched, up, the, tower, the, following, day, at, 05, 30, on, 16, july, 1945, the, gadget, exploded, with, an, energy, equivalent, of, around, 20, kilotons, of, tnt, leaving, a, crater, of, trinitite, radioactive, glass, in, the, desert, 250, feet, 76, m, wide, the, shock, wave, was, felt, over, 100, miles, 160, km, away, and, the, mushroom, cloud, reached, 7, 5, miles, 12, 1, km, in, height, it, was, heard, as, far, away, as, el, paso, texas, so, groves, issued, a, cover, story, about, an, ammunition, magazine, explosion, at, alamogordo, field, involving, gas, shells, oppenheimer, later, claimed, that, while, witnessing, the, explosion, he, thought, of, a, verse, from, the, hindu, holy, book, the, bhagavad, gita, xi, 12, if, the, radiance, of, a, thousand, suns, were, to, burst, at, once, into, the, sky, that, would, be, like, the, splendor, of, the, mighty, one, together, with, verse, xi, 32, which, he, translated, as, now, i, am, become, death, destroyer, of, worlds, the, test, was, significantly, more, successful, than, had, been, anticipated, this, was, immediately, cabled, to, stimson, who, was, then, at, the, potsdam, conference, and, groves, hastily, prepared, a, lengthier, report, sent, via, courier, truman, was, powerfully, and, positively, affected, by, the, news, stimson, noted, in, his, diary, that, when, he, shared, it, with, churchill, churchill, remarked, now, i, know, what, happened, to, truman, yesterday, i, couldn, t, understand, it, when, he, got, to, the, meeting, after, having, read, this, report, he, was, a, changed, man, he, told, the, russians, just, where, they, got, on, and, off, and, generally, bossed, the, whole, meeting, at, its, peak, in, june, 1944, the, manhattan, project, employed, about, 129, 000, workers, of, whom, 84, 500, were, construction, workers, 40, 500, were, plant, operators, and, 1, 800, were, military, personnel, as, construction, activity, declined, the, workforce, fell, to, 100, 000, a, year, later, but, the, number, of, military, personnel, increased, to, 5, 600, procuring, the, required, numbers, of, workers, especially, highly, skilled, workers, in, competition, with, other, vital, wartime, programs, proved, very, difficult, due, to, high, turnover, over, 500, 000, people, worked, on, the, project, most, african, americans, were, employed, in, low, level, jobs, but, there, were, a, few, african, american, scientists, and, technicians, the, unique, labor, and, security, requirements, also, resulted, in, the, manhattan, project, having, a, higher, percentage, of, women, in, technical, roles, than, later, government, projects, in, 1943, groves, obtained, a, special, temporary, priority, for, labor, from, the, war, manpower, commission, in, march, 1944, both, the, war, production, board, and, the, war, manpower, commission, gave, the, project, their, highest, priority, the, kansas, commission, director, stated, that, from, april, to, july, 1944, every, qualified, applicant, in, the, state, who, visited, a, united, states, employment, service, office, was, urged, to, work, at, the, hanford, site, no, other, job, was, offered, until, the, applicant, definitively, rejected, the, offer, tolman, and, conant, in, their, role, as, the, project, s, scientific, advisers, drew, up, a, list, of, candidate, scientists, and, had, them, rated, by, scientists, already, working, on, the, project, groves, then, sent, a, personal, letter, to, the, head, of, their, university, or, company, asking, for, them, to, be, released, for, essential, war, work, one, source, of, skilled, personnel, was, the, army, itself, particularly, the, army, specialized, training, program, in, 1943, the, med, created, the, special, engineer, detachment, sed, with, an, authorized, strength, of, 675, technicians, and, skilled, workers, drafted, into, the, army, were, assigned, to, the, sed, another, source, was, the, women, s, army, corps, wac, initially, intended, for, clerical, tasks, handling, classified, material, the, wacs, were, soon, tapped, for, technical, and, scientific, tasks, as, well, on, 1, february, 1945, all, military, personnel, assigned, to, the, med, including, all, sed, detachments, were, assigned, to, the, 9812th, technical, service, unit, except, at, los, alamos, where, military, personnel, other, than, sed, including, the, wacs, and, military, police, were, assigned, to, the, 4817th, service, command, unit, an, associate, professor, of, radiology, at, the, university, of, rochester, school, of, medicine, stafford, l, warren, was, commissioned, as, a, colonel, in, the, united, states, army, medical, corps, and, appointed, as, chief, of, the, med, s, medical, section, and, groves, medical, advisor, warren, s, initial, task, was, to, staff, hospitals, at, oak, ridge, richland, and, los, alamos, the, medical, section, was, responsible, for, medical, research, but, also, for, the, med, s, health, and, safety, programs, this, presented, an, enormous, challenge, because, workers, were, handling, a, variety, of, toxic, chemicals, using, hazardous, liquids, and, gases, under, high, pressures, working, with, high, voltages, and, performing, experiments, involving, explosives, not, to, mention, the, largely, unknown, dangers, presented, by, radioactivity, and, handling, fissile, materials, yet, in, december, 1945, the, national, safety, council, presented, the, manhattan, project, with, the, award, of, honor, for, distinguished, service, to, safety, in, recognition, of, its, safety, record, between, january, 1943, and, june, 1945, there, were, 62, fatalities, and, 3, 879, disabling, injuries, about, 62, percent, below, the, rate, of, private, industry, the, manhattan, project, operated, under, a, mandate, of, absolute, secrecy, from, roosevelt, meaning, that, the, very, existence, of, the, project, itself, was, to, be, kept, secret, this, proved, a, daunting, task, given, the, amount, of, knowledge, and, speculation, about, nuclear, fission, that, existed, prior, to, the, manhattan, project, the, huge, numbers, of, people, involved, and, the, scale, of, the, facilities, groves, adopted, an, extreme, version, of, compartmentalization, the, need, to, know, policy, compartmentalization, of, knowledge, to, me, was, the, very, heart, of, security, my, rule, was, simple, and, not, capable, of, misinterpretation, each, man, should, know, everything, he, needed, to, know, to, do, his, job, and, nothing, else, adherence, to, this, rule, not, only, provided, an, adequate, measure, of, security, but, it, greatly, improved, over, all, efficiency, by, making, our, people, stick, to, their, knitting, and, it, made, quite, clear, to, all, concerned, that, the, project, existed, to, produce, a, specific, end, product, not, to, enable, individuals, to, satisfy, their, curiosity, and, to, increase, their, scientific, knowledge, this, clashed, with, the, norms, of, many, of, the, scientists, involved, who, claimed, that, science, could, not, operate, successfully, under, such, requirements, the, manhattan, project, officials, also, had, difficulty, with, journalists, congressmen, federal, officials, who, were, not, in, the, know, residents, near, local, sites, judges, adjudicating, land, claims, and, other, sources, of, speculation, prying, and, leaks, along, with, concerns, about, espionage, and, sabotage, groves, relied, on, the, fbi, and, his, own, autonomous, g, 2, intelligence, unit, to, investigate, potential, security, violations, ultimately, over, 1, 500, loose, talk, cases, were, investigated, during, the, war, even, harry, truman, was, not, informed, about, the, project, while, he, was, vice, president, and, only, learned, about, it, after, roosevelt, s, death, because, of, its, relative, success, at, keeping, the, story, out, of, newspapers, byron, price, head, of, the, office, of, censorship, ultimately, designated, the, manhattan, project, the, best, kept, secret, of, the, war, in, 1945, life, estimated, that, before, the, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, bombings, probably, no, more, than, a, few, dozen, men, in, the, entire, country, knew, the, full, meaning, of, the, manhattan, project, and, perhaps, only, a, thousand, others, even, were, aware, that, work, on, atoms, was, involved, the, magazine, wrote, that, the, more, than, 100, 000, others, employed, with, the, project, worked, like, moles, in, the, dark, warned, that, disclosing, the, project, s, secrets, was, punishable, by, 10, years, in, prison, or, a, fine, of, us, 10, 000, equivalent, to, 169, 000, in, 2023, they, monitored, dials, and, switches, while, behind, thick, concrete, walls, mysterious, reactions, took, place, without, knowing, the, purpose, of, their, jobs, in, december, 1945, the, us, army, published, a, secret, report, assessing, the, security, apparatus, surrounding, the, manhattan, project, the, report, states, that, the, project, was, more, drastically, guarded, than, any, other, highly, secret, war, development, the, surrounding, security, infrastructure, was, so, vast, and, thorough, that, in, the, early, days, of, the, project, in, 1943, investigators, vetted, 400, 000, potential, employees, and, 600, companies, for, potential, security, risks, voluntary, censorship, of, atomic, information, began, before, the, manhattan, project, after, the, start, of, the, european, war, in, 1939, american, scientists, began, avoiding, publishing, military, related, research, and, in, 1940, scientific, journals, began, asking, the, national, academy, of, sciences, to, clear, articles, william, l, laurence, of, the, new, york, times, who, wrote, an, article, on, atomic, fission, in, the, saturday, evening, post, of, 7, september, 1940, later, learned, that, government, officials, asked, librarians, nationwide, in, 1943, to, withdraw, the, issue, the, soviets, noticed, the, silence, however, in, april, 1942, nuclear, physicist, georgy, flyorov, wrote, to, joseph, stalin, on, the, absence, of, articles, on, nuclear, fission, in, american, journals, this, resulted, in, the, soviet, union, establishing, its, own, atomic, bomb, project, the, manhattan, project, operated, under, tight, security, lest, its, discovery, induce, axis, powers, especially, germany, to, accelerate, their, own, nuclear, projects, or, undertake, covert, operations, against, the, project, the, office, of, censorship, relied, on, the, press, to, comply, with, a, voluntary, code, of, conduct, it, published, and, the, project, at, first, avoided, notifying, the, office, by, early, 1943, newspapers, began, publishing, reports, of, large, construction, in, tennessee, and, washington, and, the, office, began, discussing, with, the, project, how, to, maintain, secrecy, in, june, it, asked, newspapers, and, broadcasters, to, avoid, discussing, atom, smashing, atomic, energy, atomic, fission, atomic, splitting, or, any, of, their, equivalents, the, use, for, military, purposes, of, radium, or, radioactive, materials, heavy, water, high, voltage, discharge, equipment, cyclotrons, the, prospect, of, sabotage, was, always, present, and, sometimes, suspected, when, there, were, equipment, failures, while, there, were, some, problems, believed, to, be, the, result, of, careless, or, disgruntled, employees, there, were, no, confirmed, instances, of, axis, instigated, sabotage, however, on, 10, march, 1945, a, japanese, fire, balloon, struck, a, power, line, and, the, resulting, power, surge, caused, the, three, reactors, at, hanford, to, be, temporarily, shut, down, with, so, many, people, involved, security, was, difficult, a, special, counter, intelligence, corps, detachment, was, formed, to, handle, the, project, s, security, issues, by, 1943, it, was, clear, that, the, soviet, union, was, attempting, to, penetrate, the, project, lieutenant, colonel, boris, t, pash, the, head, of, the, counter, intelligence, branch, of, the, western, defense, command, investigated, suspected, soviet, espionage, at, the, radiation, laboratory, in, berkeley, oppenheimer, informed, pash, that, he, had, been, approached, by, a, fellow, professor, at, berkeley, haakon, chevalier, about, passing, information, to, the, soviet, union, the, most, successful, soviet, spy, was, klaus, fuchs, a, physicist, and, member, of, the, british, mission, who, was, intimately, involved, in, work, at, los, alamos, on, the, design, of, the, implosion, bomb, his, espionage, activities, were, not, identified, until, 1950, as, a, result, of, venona, project, the, revelation, of, his, espionage, activities, damaged, the, united, states, nuclear, cooperation, with, britain, and, canada, and, other, instances, of, espionage, were, subsequently, uncovered, leading, to, the, arrest, of, harry, gold, david, greenglass, and, julius, and, ethel, rosenberg, other, spies, like, george, koval, and, theodore, hall, remained, unknown, for, decades, the, value, of, the, espionage, is, difficult, to, quantify, as, the, principal, constraint, on, the, soviet, atomic, bomb, project, was, their, short, supply, of, uranium, ore, it, may, have, saved, the, soviets, at, least, one, or, two, years, in, the, development, of, their, own, bomb, although, some, historians, have, argued, the, soviets, spent, as, much, time, vetting, and, reduplicating, the, information, as, they, would, have, saved, had, they, trusted, it, in, addition, to, developing, the, atomic, bomb, the, manhattan, project, was, charged, with, gathering, intelligence, on, the, german, nuclear, energy, project, it, was, believed, that, the, japanese, nuclear, weapons, program, was, not, far, advanced, because, japan, had, little, access, to, uranium, ore, but, it, was, initially, feared, that, germany, was, very, close, to, developing, its, own, weapons, at, the, instigation, of, the, manhattan, project, a, bombing, and, sabotage, campaign, was, carried, out, against, heavy, water, plants, in, german, occupied, norway, a, small, mission, was, created, jointly, staffed, by, the, office, of, naval, intelligence, osrd, the, manhattan, project, and, army, intelligence, g, 2, to, investigate, enemy, scientific, developments, it, was, not, restricted, to, those, involving, nuclear, weapons, the, chief, of, army, intelligence, major, general, george, v, strong, appointed, boris, pash, to, command, the, unit, which, was, codenamed, alsos, greek, for, grove, samuel, goudsmit, was, the, scientific, director, of, the, alsos, mission, the, alsos, mission, to, italy, questioned, physics, laboratory, staff, at, the, university, of, rome, following, the, capture, of, the, city, in, june, 1944, meanwhile, pash, formed, a, combined, british, and, american, alsos, mission, in, london, under, the, command, of, captain, horace, k, calvert, to, participate, in, operation, overlord, groves, considered, the, risk, that, the, germans, might, attempt, to, disrupt, the, normandy, landings, with, radioactive, poisons, was, sufficient, to, warn, general, dwight, d, eisenhower, and, send, an, officer, to, brief, his, chief, of, staff, lieutenant, general, walter, bedell, smith, under, the, codename, operation, peppermint, special, equipment, was, prepared, and, chemical, warfare, service, teams, were, trained, in, its, use, following, in, the, wake, of, the, advancing, allied, armies, the, alsos, team, interrogated, scientists, and, searched, facilities, in, liberated, areas, of, france, and, germany, to, learn, about, the, german, work, goudsmit, concluded, in, november, 1944, that, the, german, nuclear, program, had, never, made, it, beyond, the, laboratory, stage, as, he, put, it, later, the, evidence, at, hand, proved, definitely, that, germany, had, no, atom, bomb, and, was, not, likely, to, have, one, in, any, reasonable, time, interrogation, of, german, prisoners, indicated, that, uranium, and, thorium, were, being, processed, in, oranienburg, so, groves, arranged, for, it, to, be, bombed, on, 15, march, 1945, to, deny, its, capture, by, the, soviet, union, an, alsos, team, went, to, stassfurt, in, the, soviet, occupation, zone, and, retrieved, 11, tons, of, ore, from, wifo, in, april, 1945, pash, in, command, of, a, composite, force, known, as, t, force, conducted, operation, harborage, a, sweep, behind, enemy, lines, of, hechingen, bisingen, and, haigerloch, the, heart, of, the, german, nuclear, effort, t, force, captured, nuclear, laboratories, documents, equipment, and, supplies, including, heavy, water, and, 1, 5, tons, of, metallic, uranium, alsos, teams, rounded, up, german, scientists, including, kurt, diebner, otto, hahn, walther, gerlach, werner, heisenberg, and, carl, friedrich, von, weizs, cker, they, were, taken, to, england, and, interned, at, farm, hall, where, they, were, surreptitiously, surveilled, the, only, allied, aircraft, capable, of, carrying, the, 17, foot, 5, 2, m, long, thin, man, or, the, 59, inch, 150, cm, wide, fat, man, was, the, british, avro, lancaster, but, using, a, british, aircraft, would, have, caused, difficulties, with, maintenance, groves, hoped, that, the, american, boeing, b, 29, superfortress, could, be, modified, to, carry, a, thin, man, by, joining, its, two, bomb, bays, together, this, became, unnecessary, after, thin, man, was, abandoned, as, a, little, boy, was, short, enough, to, fit, into, a, b, 29, bomb, bay, but, modifications, were, still, required, the, army, air, forces, materiel, command, at, wright, field, ohio, began, silverplate, the, codename, for, the, modification, of, the, b, 29, in, november, 1943, test, drops, were, carried, out, at, muroc, army, air, field, and, the, naval, ordnance, test, station, in, california, with, thin, man, and, fat, man, pumpkin, bombs, to, test, their, ballistic, fuzing, and, stability, characteristics, the, 509th, composite, group, was, activated, on, 17, december, 1944, at, wendover, army, air, field, utah, under, the, command, of, colonel, paul, w, tibbets, its, 393rd, bombardment, squadron, equipped, with, silverplate, b, 29s, practiced, long, distance, flights, over, water, and, dropped, pumpkin, bombs, a, special, unit, known, as, project, alberta, was, formed, at, los, alamos, under, parsons, s, command, to, assist, in, preparing, and, delivering, the, bombs, the, 509th, composite, group, deployed, to, north, field, on, tinian, in, july, 1945, most, of, the, components, for, the, little, boy, left, san, francisco, on, the, cruiser, uss, indianapolis, on, 16, july, and, arrived, on, tinian, on, 26, july, the, remaining, components, which, included, six, highly, enriched, uranium, rings, were, delivered, by, three, douglas, c, 54, skymasters, of, the, 509th, group, s, 320th, troop, carrier, squadron, two, fat, man, assemblies, traveled, to, tinian, in, specially, modified, 509th, composite, group, b, 29s, and, the, first, plutonium, core, went, in, a, special, c, 54, at, the, end, of, december, 1944, worried, by, the, heavy, losses, occurring, in, the, battle, of, the, bulge, roosevelt, instructed, groves, and, stimson, that, if, the, atomic, bombs, were, ready, before, the, war, with, germany, ended, they, should, be, ready, to, drop, them, on, germany, but, japan, was, regarded, as, more, likely, in, late, april, 1945, a, targeting, committee, was, established, to, determine, which, cities, should, be, targets, and, it, recommended, kokura, hiroshima, niigata, and, kyoto, stimson, intervened, announcing, that, he, would, be, making, the, targeting, decision, and, that, he, would, not, authorize, the, bombing, of, kyoto, on, the, grounds, of, its, historical, and, religious, significance, nagasaki, was, ultimately, substituted, in, may, 1945, the, interim, committee, was, created, to, advise, on, wartime, and, postwar, use, of, nuclear, energy, the, interim, committee, in, turn, established, a, scientific, panel, consisting, of, arthur, compton, fermi, lawrence, and, oppenheimer, the, scientific, panel, offered, its, opinion, not, just, on, the, likely, physical, effects, of, an, atomic, bomb, but, on, its, probable, military, and, political, impact, in, a, meeting, on, 1, june, the, interim, committee, resolved, that, the, bomb, should, be, used, against, japan, as, soon, as, possible, that, it, be, used, on, a, war, plant, surrounded, by, workers, homes, and, that, it, be, used, without, prior, warning, at, the, potsdam, conference, in, germany, president, harry, s, truman, told, stalin, that, the, us, had, a, new, weapon, of, unusual, destructive, force, without, giving, any, details, as, he, showed, no, special, interest, truman, erroneously, assumed, that, stalin, did, not, understand, in, reality, soviet, spies, had, kept, stalin, informed, of, the, work, and, the, planned, test, a, strike, order, from, general, thomas, t, handy, to, general, carl, spaatz, was, approved, by, marshall, and, stimson, on, 25, july, which, specified, that, the, first, special, bomb, be, used, after, about, 3, august, 1945, and, that, additional, bombs, would, be, used, as, soon, as, made, ready, by, the, project, staff, the, operational, plan, was, to, drop, the, first, bomb, on, 2, august, the, second, bomb, on, 10, august, and, a, third, bomb, around, 24, august, however, due, to, weather, conditions, over, japan, and, the, desire, for, visual, bombing, the, date, of, the, first, bombing, mission, was, pushed, back, to, 6, august, and, the, second, was, moved, forward, to, 9, august, on, 6, august, 1945, the, enola, gay, a, boeing, b, 29, superfortress, of, the, 393d, bombardment, squadron, piloted, by, tibbets, lifted, off, from, north, field, with, a, little, boy, in, its, bomb, bay, hiroshima, the, headquarters, of, the, 2nd, general, army, and, fifth, division, and, a, port, of, embarkation, was, the, primary, target, with, kokura, and, nagasaki, as, alternatives, parsons, the, weaponeer, in, charge, of, the, mission, completed, the, bomb, assembly, in, the, air, to, minimize, the, risks, of, a, nuclear, explosion, in, the, event, of, a, crash, during, takeoff, the, bomb, detonated, at, an, altitude, of, 1, 750, feet, 530, m, with, a, blast, that, was, later, estimated, to, be, the, equivalent, of, 13, kilotons, of, tnt, an, area, of, approximately, 4, 7, square, miles, 12, km, 2, was, destroyed, japanese, officials, determined, that, 69, of, hiroshima, s, buildings, were, destroyed, and, another, 6, 7, damaged, early, estimates, were, that, 66, 000, people, were, killed, and, 69, 000, injured, later, re, estimations, that, included, people, ignored, by, previous, methods, like, korean, slave, laborers, and, additional, soldiers, concluded, there, might, have, been, 140, 000, dead, from, the, attack, by, december, 1945, on, the, morning, of, 9, august, 1945, the, bockscar, a, second, b, 29, piloted, by, the, 393d, bombardment, squadron, s, commander, major, charles, w, sweeney, lifted, off, with, a, fat, man, on, board, this, time, ashworth, served, as, weaponeer, and, kokura, was, the, primary, target, when, they, reached, kokura, they, found, cloud, cover, had, obscured, the, city, prohibiting, the, visual, attack, required, by, orders, after, three, runs, and, with, fuel, running, low, they, headed, for, the, secondary, target, nagasaki, ashworth, decided, that, a, radar, approach, would, be, used, if, the, target, was, obscured, but, a, last, minute, break, in, the, clouds, over, nagasaki, allowed, a, visual, approach, as, ordered, the, fat, man, was, dropped, over, the, city, s, industrial, valley, midway, between, the, mitsubishi, steel, and, arms, works, in, the, south, and, the, mitsubishi, urakami, ordnance, works, in, the, north, the, resulting, explosion, had, a, blast, yield, equivalent, to, 21, kilotons, of, tnt, roughly, the, same, as, the, trinity, blast, but, was, confined, to, the, urakami, valley, and, a, major, portion, of, the, city, including, the, city, center, was, protected, by, the, intervening, hills, about, 44, of, the, city, was, destroyed, and, estimates, of, casualties, range, from, 40, 000, to, 80, 000, people, killed, and, at, least, 60, 000, injured, overall, an, estimated, 35, 000, 40, 000, people, were, killed, and, 60, 000, injured, groves, expected, to, have, another, atomic, bomb, ready, for, use, on, 19, august, with, three, more, in, september, and, a, further, three, in, october, two, more, fat, man, assemblies, were, readied, and, scheduled, to, leave, kirtland, field, for, tinian, on, 11, and, 14, august, at, los, alamos, technicians, worked, 24, hours, straight, to, cast, another, plutonium, core, although, cast, it, still, needed, to, be, pressed, and, coated, which, would, take, until, 16, august, it, could, therefore, have, been, ready, for, use, on, 19, august, on, 10, august, truman, was, informed, that, another, bomb, was, being, prepared, he, ordered, that, no, additional, atomic, bombs, could, be, used, without, his, express, authority, according, to, henry, a, wallace, truman, told, his, cabinet, that, the, thought, of, wiping, out, another, 100, 000, people, was, too, horrible, he, didn, t, like, the, idea, of, killing, as, he, said, all, those, kids, groves, suspended, the, third, core, s, shipment, on, 13, august, on, 11, august, groves, phoned, warren, with, orders, to, organize, a, survey, team, to, report, on, the, damage, and, radioactivity, at, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, as, soon, as, the, war, ended, a, party, equipped, with, portable, geiger, counters, arrived, in, hiroshima, on, 8, september, headed, by, farrell, and, warren, with, japanese, rear, admiral, masao, tsuzuki, who, acted, as, a, translator, they, remained, in, hiroshima, until, 14, september, and, then, surveyed, nagasaki, from, 19, september, to, 8, october, this, and, other, scientific, missions, to, japan, provided, valuable, data, on, the, effects, of, the, atomic, bomb, and, led, to, the, creation, of, the, atomic, bomb, casualty, commission, in, anticipation, of, the, bombings, groves, had, commissioned, physicist, henry, dewolf, smyth, to, prepare, a, sanitized, technical, history, of, the, project, for, public, consumption, the, idea, of, releasing, such, information, freely, was, controversial, the, decision, to, do, so, was, made, by, truman, personally, the, smyth, report, was, released, to, the, public, on, 12, august, 1945, japan, announced, its, surrender, on, 15, august, the, necessity, of, the, bombings, became, a, subject, of, controversy, among, historians, some, questioned, whether, atomic, diplomacy, would, have, attained, the, same, goals, and, the, relative, weight, that, the, bombs, and, the, soviet, declaration, of, war, had, on, the, japanese, willingness, to, surrender, the, franck, report, was, the, most, notable, effort, pushing, for, a, demonstration, but, was, turned, down, by, the, interim, committee, s, scientific, panel, the, szil, rd, petition, drafted, in, july, 1945, and, signed, by, dozens, of, scientists, working, on, the, manhattan, project, was, a, late, attempt, at, warning, truman, about, his, responsibility, in, using, such, weapons, the, manhattan, project, became, instantly, famous, after, the, bombing, of, hiroshima, and, the, partial, lifting, of, its, secrecy, it, was, widely, credited, with, ending, the, war, and, groves, worked, to, credit, its, contractors, whose, work, had, hitherto, been, secret, groves, and, nichols, presented, them, with, army, navy, e, awards, and, over, 20, presidential, medals, for, merit, were, awarded, to, key, contractors, and, scientists, including, bush, and, oppenheimer, military, personnel, received, the, legion, of, merit, the, manhattan, project, persisted, until, 31, december, 1946, and, the, manhattan, district, to, 15, august, 1947, during, this, time, it, suffered, from, numerous, difficulties, caused, by, technical, problems, the, effects, of, rapid, demobilization, and, a, lack, of, clarity, on, its, long, term, mission, at, hanford, plutonium, production, declined, as, reactors, b, d, and, f, wore, out, poisoned, by, fission, products, and, swelling, of, the, graphite, moderator, known, as, the, wigner, effect, the, swelling, damaged, the, charging, tubes, where, the, uranium, was, irradiated, to, produce, plutonium, rendering, them, unusable, production, was, curtailed, and, the, oldest, unit, b, pile, was, closed, down, so, at, least, one, reactor, would, remain, available, research, continued, with, dupont, and, the, metallurgical, laboratory, developing, a, redox, solvent, extraction, process, as, an, alternative, plutonium, extraction, technique, to, the, bismuth, phosphate, process, which, left, unspent, uranium, in, a, state, from, which, it, could, not, easily, be, recovered, bomb, engineering, was, carried, out, by, the, z, division, initially, located, at, wendover, field, but, moved, to, oxnard, field, new, mexico, in, september, 1945, to, be, closer, to, los, alamos, this, marked, the, beginning, of, the, sandia, base, nearby, kirtland, field, was, used, as, a, b, 29, base, for, aircraft, compatibility, and, drop, tests, as, reservist, officers, were, demobilized, they, were, replaced, by, about, fifty, hand, picked, regular, officers, nichols, recommended, that, s, 50, and, the, alpha, tracks, at, y, 12, be, closed, down, this, was, done, in, september, although, performing, better, than, ever, the, alpha, tracks, could, not, compete, with, k, 25, and, the, new, k, 27, which, had, commenced, operation, in, january, 1946, in, december, the, y, 12, plant, was, closed, cutting, the, tennessee, eastman, payroll, from, 8, 600, to, 1, 500, and, saving, 2, million, a, month, nowhere, was, demobilization, more, of, a, problem, than, at, los, alamos, where, there, was, an, exodus, of, talent, much, remained, to, be, done, the, bombs, used, on, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, needed, work, to, make, them, simpler, safer, and, more, reliable, implosion, methods, needed, to, be, developed, for, uranium, in, place, of, the, wasteful, gun, method, and, composite, uranium, plutonium, cores, were, needed, now, that, plutonium, was, in, short, supply, however, uncertainty, about, the, future, of, the, laboratory, made, it, hard, to, induce, people, to, stay, oppenheimer, returned, to, his, job, at, the, university, of, california, and, groves, appointed, norris, bradbury, as, an, interim, replacement, bradbury, remained, in, the, post, for, the, next, 25, years, groves, attempted, to, combat, the, dissatisfaction, caused, by, the, lack, of, amenities, with, a, construction, program, that, included, an, improved, water, supply, three, hundred, houses, and, recreation, facilities, manhattan, project, personnel, participated, in, the, first, postwar, nuclear, tests, operation, crossroads, conducted, at, bikini, atoll, in, july, 1946, two, fat, man, type, bombs, were, detonated, one, as, an, airburst, one, as, an, underwater, burst, to, investigate, the, effect, of, nuclear, weapons, on, warships, press, and, international, observers, were, allowed, to, attend, making, the, tests, an, international, spectacle, following, a, domestic, debate, over, the, peacetime, management, of, the, nuclear, program, the, atomic, energy, act, of, 1946, created, the, united, states, atomic, energy, commission, to, take, over, the, project, s, functions, and, assets, it, established, civilian, control, over, atomic, development, military, aspects, were, taken, over, by, the, armed, forces, special, weapons, project, afswp, after, the, bombings, at, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, a, number, of, manhattan, project, physicists, founded, the, bulletin, of, the, atomic, scientists, 1945, and, emergency, committee, of, atomic, scientists, 1946, which, began, as, an, emergency, action, undertaken, by, scientists, who, saw, urgent, need, for, an, educational, program, about, atomic, weapons, in, the, face, of, the, destructiveness, of, the, bombs, and, in, anticipation, of, the, nuclear, arms, race, several, project, members, including, bohr, bush, and, conant, expressed, the, view, that, it, was, necessary, to, reach, agreement, on, international, control, of, nuclear, research, and, atomic, weapons, the, baruch, plan, unveiled, in, a, speech, to, the, newly, formed, united, nations, atomic, energy, commission, unaec, in, june, 1946, proposed, the, establishment, of, an, international, atomic, development, authority, but, was, not, adopted, the, project, expenditure, through, 1, october, 1945, was, 1, 845, billion, equivalent, to, less, than, nine, days, of, wartime, spending, and, was, 2, 191, billion, when, the, aec, assumed, control, on, 1, january, 1947, the, total, allocation, was, 2, 4, billion, 84, of, the, costs, through, the, end, of, 1945, were, spent, on, the, plants, at, oak, ridge, and, hanford, producing, the, enriched, uranium, and, plutonium, needed, to, fuel, the, bombs, at, both, sites, the, majority, of, the, costs, were, for, construction, 74, at, oak, ridge, 87, at, hanford, with, the, rest, being, for, operations, initial, funding, for, the, project, was, through, the, general, budget, of, the, office, of, scientific, research, and, development, as, plans, were, made, to, turn, the, work, over, to, the, army, corps, of, engineers, bush, wrote, to, roosevelt, in, late, 1942, that, it, would, be, ruinous, to, the, essential, secrecy, to, have, to, defend, before, an, appropriations, committee, any, request, for, funds, for, this, project, instead, initial, funding, was, done, through, discretionary, funds, to, which, roosevelt, had, access, as, it, grew, in, size, and, cost, congress, was, deliberately, kept, ignorant, of, the, project, because, of, concerns, that, congressmen, were, prone, to, leaking, information, and, because, it, was, feared, that, the, project, would, appear, to, be, a, boondoggle, appropriations, requests, were, quietly, slipped, into, other, bills, but, the, project, s, mounting, costs, and, large, facilities, which, appeared, to, many, to, produce, nothing, attracted, scrutiny, from, several, congressional, auditors, the, truman, committee, that, investigated, wartime, waste, and, fraud, attempted, to, audit, the, project, several, times, but, each, time, their, inquiries, were, rejected, these, congressional, inquiries, along, with, the, need, for, smooth, budgetary, approval, led, to, bush, groves, and, stimson, agreeing, in, the, spring, of, 1944, that, a, few, high, ranking, congressmen, should, be, told, of, the, project, s, purpose, by, march, 1945, exactly, seven, congressmen, were, officially, informed, the, funds, were, hidden, into, appropriation, requests, with, the, inconspicuous, headings, frequently, engineer, service, army, and, expediting, production, in, late, may, 1945, to, further, expedite, budget, issues, and, assure, the, cooperation, of, albert, j, engel, who, had, threatened, to, reveal, the, existence, of, the, project, if, he, was, not, told, more, about, it, five, additional, congressmen, were, permitted, to, visit, the, oak, ridge, site, to, assure, themselves, of, the, reasonableness, of, the, various, living, accommodations, which, had, been, provided, that, they, actually, observe, the, size, and, scope, of, the, installations, and, that, some, of, the, complexities, of, the, project, be, demonstrated, to, them, during, the, war, the, manhattan, project, ultimately, produced, the, three, bombs, used, the, trinity, gadget, little, boy, and, fat, man, as, well, as, an, additional, unused, fat, man, bomb, making, the, average, wartime, cost, per, bomb, around, 500, million, in, 1945, dollars, by, comparison, the, project, s, total, cost, by, the, end, of, 1945, was, about, 90, of, the, total, spent, on, the, production, of, us, small, arms, not, including, ammunition, and, 34, of, the, total, spent, on, us, tanks, during, the, same, period, it, was, the, second, most, expensive, weapons, project, undertaken, by, the, united, states, during, the, war, behind, only, the, boeing, b, 29, superfortress, the, political, and, cultural, impacts, of, the, development, of, nuclear, weapons, were, profound, william, laurence, of, the, new, york, times, the, first, to, use, the, phrase, atomic, age, became, the, official, correspondent, for, the, manhattan, project, in, spring, 1945, he, witnessed, both, the, trinity, test, and, the, bombing, of, nagasaki, and, wrote, the, official, press, releases, on, them, he, went, on, to, write, a, series, of, articles, extolling, the, virtues, of, the, new, weapon, his, reporting, helped, to, spur, public, awareness, of, the, potential, of, nuclear, technology, and, motivated, its, development, in, the, united, states, and, soviet, union, the, manhattan, project, left, a, legacy, of, a, network, of, national, laboratories, the, lawrence, berkeley, national, laboratory, los, alamos, national, laboratory, oak, ridge, national, laboratory, argonne, national, laboratory, and, ames, laboratory, two, more, were, established, by, groves, soon, after, the, war, the, brookhaven, national, laboratory, at, upton, new, york, and, the, sandia, national, laboratories, at, albuquerque, new, mexico, groves, allocated, 72, million, to, them, for, research, activities, in, fiscal, year, 1946, 1947, they, would, be, in, the, vanguard, of, the, kind, of, large, scale, research, that, alvin, weinberg, the, director, of, the, oak, ridge, national, laboratory, would, call, big, science, the, naval, research, laboratory, had, long, been, interested, in, the, prospect, of, using, nuclear, power, for, warship, propulsion, and, sought, to, create, its, own, nuclear, project, in, may, 1946, nimitz, now, chief, of, naval, operations, decided, that, the, navy, should, instead, work, with, the, manhattan, project, a, group, of, naval, officers, were, assigned, to, oak, ridge, the, most, senior, of, whom, was, captain, hyman, g, rickover, who, became, assistant, director, there, they, immersed, themselves, in, the, study, of, nuclear, energy, laying, the, foundations, for, a, nuclear, powered, navy, a, similar, group, of, air, force, personnel, arrived, at, oak, ridge, in, september, 1946, with, the, aim, of, developing, nuclear, aircraft, their, nuclear, energy, for, the, propulsion, of, aircraft, project, ran, into, formidable, technical, difficulties, and, was, ultimately, canceled, the, ability, of, the, new, reactors, to, create, radioactive, isotopes, in, previously, unheard, of, quantities, sparked, a, revolution, in, nuclear, medicine, starting, in, mid, 1946, oak, ridge, began, distributing, radioisotopes, to, hospitals, and, universities, primarily, iodine, 131, and, phosphorus, 32, for, cancer, diagnosis, and, treatment, isotopes, were, also, used, in, biological, industrial, and, agricultural, research, its, production, sites, operating, with, new, technologies, exotic, substances, and, under, conditions, of, secrecy, and, haste, also, left, a, vast, legacy, of, waste, and, environmental, damage, at, hanford, for, example, corrosive, and, radioactive, wastes, were, stored, in, hastily, fabricated, single, shell, steel, lined, underground, storage, tanks, that, were, intended, to, be, temporary, awaiting, a, more, permanent, solution, instead, they, were, neglected, and, eventually, leaked, issues, of, this, kind, resulted, in, hanford, becoming, one, of, the, most, contaminated, nuclear, waste, sites, in, north, america, and, the, subject, of, significant, cleanup, efforts, after, it, was, deactivated, in, the, late, cold, war, on, handing, over, control, to, the, atomic, energy, commission, groves, bid, farewell, to, the, people, who, had, worked, on, the, manhattan, project, five, years, ago, the, idea, of, atomic, power, was, only, a, dream, you, have, made, that, dream, a, reality, you, have, seized, upon, the, most, nebulous, of, ideas, and, translated, them, into, actualities, you, have, built, cities, where, none, were, known, before, you, have, constructed, industrial, plants, of, a, magnitude, and, to, a, precision, heretofore, deemed, impossible, you, built, the, weapon, which, ended, the, war, and, thereby, saved, countless, american, lives, with, regard, to, peacetime, applications, you, have, raised, the, curtain, on, vistas, of, a, new, world, the, manhattan, project, national, historical, park, was, established, on,
