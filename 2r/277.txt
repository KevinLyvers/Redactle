the, first, bulgarian, empire, church, slavonic, romanized, bl, gar, sko, ts, sar, stvije, bulgarian, was, a, medieval, state, that, existed, in, southeastern, europe, between, the, 7th, and, 11th, centuries, ad, it, was, founded, in, 680, 681, after, part, of, the, bulgars, led, by, asparuh, moved, south, to, the, northeastern, balkans, there, they, secured, byzantine, recognition, of, their, right, to, settle, south, of, the, danube, by, defeating, possibly, with, the, help, of, local, south, slavic, tribes, the, byzantine, army, led, by, constantine, iv, during, the, 9th, and, 10th, century, bulgaria, at, the, height, of, its, power, spread, from, the, danube, bend, to, the, black, sea, and, from, the, dnieper, river, to, the, adriatic, sea, and, became, an, important, power, in, the, region, competing, with, the, byzantine, empire, as, the, state, solidified, its, position, in, the, balkans, it, entered, into, a, centuries, long, interaction, sometimes, friendly, and, sometimes, hostile, with, the, byzantine, empire, bulgaria, emerged, as, byzantium, s, chief, antagonist, to, its, north, resulting, in, several, wars, the, two, powers, also, enjoyed, periods, of, peace, and, alliance, most, notably, during, the, second, arab, siege, of, constantinople, where, the, bulgarian, army, broke, the, siege, and, destroyed, the, arab, army, thus, preventing, an, arab, invasion, of, southeastern, europe, byzantium, had, a, strong, cultural, influence, on, bulgaria, which, also, led, to, the, eventual, adoption, of, christianity, in, 864, after, the, disintegration, of, the, avar, khaganate, the, country, expanded, its, territory, northwest, to, the, pannonian, plain, later, the, bulgarians, confronted, the, advance, of, the, pechenegs, and, cumans, and, achieved, a, decisive, victory, over, the, magyars, forcing, them, to, establish, themselves, permanently, in, pannonia, the, ruling, bulgars, and, other, non, slavic, tribes, in, the, empire, gradually, mixed, and, adopted, the, prevailing, slavic, language, thus, gradually, forming, the, bulgarian, nation, from, the, 7th, to, the, 10th, century, since, the, 10th, century, the, demonym, bulgarian, gained, prevalence, and, became, permanent, designations, for, the, local, population, both, in, literature, and, in, common, parlance, the, development, of, old, church, slavonic, literacy, had, the, effect, of, preventing, the, assimilation, of, the, south, slavs, into, neighbouring, cultures, while, stimulating, the, formation, of, a, distinct, bulgarian, identity, after, the, adoption, of, christianity, bulgaria, became, the, foremost, cultural, and, spiritual, centre, of, slavic, europe, its, leading, cultural, position, was, further, consolidated, with, the, adoption, of, the, glagolitic, alphabet, the, invention, of, the, early, cyrillic, alphabet, shortly, after, in, the, capital, preslav, and, the, literature, produced, in, old, church, slavonic, soon, began, spreading, north, old, church, slavonic, became, the, lingua, franca, of, much, of, eastern, europe, in, 927, the, fully, independent, bulgarian, patriarchate, was, officially, recognized, during, the, late, 9th, and, early, 10th, centuries, simeon, i, achieved, a, string, of, victories, over, the, byzantines, thereafter, he, was, recognized, with, the, title, of, tsar, slavic, for, caeser, and, proceeded, to, expand, the, state, to, its, greatest, extent, after, the, annihilation, of, the, byzantine, army, in, the, battle, of, anchialus, in, 917, the, bulgarians, laid, siege, to, constantinople, in, 923, and, 924, the, siege, failed, however, and, the, bulgars, were, forced, to, retreat, the, bulgarians, suffered, a, brutal, invasion, by, sviatoslav, i, igorevich, the, grand, prince, of, the, kievan, rus, between, 967, and, 969, that, saw, the, empire, vassalised, to, the, rus, sviatoslav, was, killed, in, 972, however, seeing, the, empire, able, to, briefly, recover, but, was, unable, to, reclaim, lost, territories, north, of, the, danube, in, thrace, and, southern, macedonia, their, old, rivals, the, byzantines, eventually, recovered, and, in, 1014, under, basil, ii, the, bulgar, slayer, a, crushing, defeat, was, inflicted, on, the, bulgarians, at, the, battle, of, kleidion, basil, famously, ordered, that, every, 100, of, the, captured, 15, 000, bulgarian, prisoners, be, blinded, with, the, 100th, soldier, spared, one, eye, to, guide, the, rest, back, home, forcing, their, communities, to, care, for, them, for, the, rest, of, their, lives, by, 1018, the, last, bulgarian, strongholds, had, surrendered, to, the, byzantine, empire, and, the, first, bulgarian, empire, had, ceased, to, exist, it, was, succeeded, by, the, second, bulgarian, empire, in, 1185, the, first, bulgarian, empire, became, known, simply, as, bulgaria, since, its, recognition, by, the, byzantine, empire, in, 681, some, historians, use, the, terms, danube, bulgaria, first, bulgarian, state, or, first, bulgarian, tsardom, empire, between, 681, and, 864, the, country, is, also, called, by, modern, historians, as, the, bulgarian, khanate, or, the, bulgar, khaganate, from, the, turkic, title, of, khan, khagan, borne, by, its, rulers, it, is, often, further, specified, as, the, danube, bulgarian, khanate, or, danube, bulgar, khanate, in, order, to, differentiate, it, from, volga, bulgaria, which, emerged, from, another, bulgar, group, from, the, country, s, christianization, in, 864, and, the, assumption, of, the, imperial, title, by, its, rulers, in, 913, the, country, is, also, referred, to, as, the, principality, of, bulgaria, in, english, language, sources, the, country, is, often, known, as, the, bulgarian, empire, parts, of, the, eastern, balkan, peninsula, were, in, antiquity, inhabited, by, the, thracians, who, were, a, group, of, indo, european, tribes, the, whole, region, as, far, north, as, the, danube, river, was, gradually, incorporated, into, the, roman, empire, by, the, 1st, century, ad, the, decline, of, the, roman, empire, after, the, 3rd, century, ad, and, the, continuous, invasions, of, goths, and, huns, left, much, of, the, region, devastated, depopulated, and, in, economic, decline, by, the, 5th, century, the, surviving, eastern, half, of, the, roman, empire, called, by, later, historians, the, byzantine, empire, could, not, exercise, effective, control, in, these, territories, other, than, in, the, coastal, areas, and, certain, cities, in, the, interior, nonetheless, it, never, relinquished, the, claim, to, the, whole, region, up, to, the, danube, a, series, of, administrative, legislative, military, and, economic, reforms, somewhat, improved, the, situation, but, despite, these, reforms, disorder, continued, in, much, of, the, balkans, the, reign, of, emperor, justinian, i, r, 527, 565, saw, temporary, recovery, of, control, and, reconstruction, of, a, number, of, fortresses, but, after, his, death, the, empire, was, unable, to, face, the, threat, of, the, slavs, due, to, the, significant, reduction, of, revenue, and, manpower, the, slavs, of, indo, european, origin, were, first, mentioned, in, written, sources, to, inhabit, the, territories, to, the, north, of, the, danube, in, the, 5th, century, ad, but, most, historians, agree, that, they, had, arrived, earlier, the, group, of, slavs, that, came, to, be, known, as, the, south, slavs, was, divided, into, antes, and, sclaveni, who, spoke, the, same, language, the, slavic, incursions, in, the, balkans, increased, during, the, second, half, of, justinian, i, s, reign, and, while, these, were, initially, pillaging, raids, large, scale, settlement, began, in, the, 570s, and, 580s, this, migration, is, associated, with, the, arrival, of, the, avars, who, settled, in, the, plains, of, pannonia, between, the, rivers, danube, and, tisza, in, the, 560s, subjugating, various, bulgar, and, slavic, tribes, in, the, process, consumed, in, bitter, wars, with, the, persian, sasanian, empire, in, the, east, the, byzantines, had, few, resources, with, which, to, confront, the, slavs, the, slavs, came, in, large, numbers, and, the, lack, of, political, organisation, made, it, very, difficult, to, stop, them, because, there, was, no, political, leader, to, defeat, in, battle, and, thereby, force, their, retreat, as, the, wars, with, persia, persisted, the, 610s, and, 620s, saw, a, new, and, even, larger, migration, wave, with, the, slavs, penetrating, further, south, into, the, balkans, reaching, thessaly, thrace, and, peloponnese, and, raiding, some, islands, in, the, aegean, sea, the, byzantines, held, out, in, salonica, and, a, number, of, coastal, towns, but, beyond, these, areas, the, imperial, authority, in, the, balkans, disappeared, the, bulgars, were, turkic, semi, nomadic, warrior, tribes, that, flourished, in, the, pontic, caspian, steppe, and, the, volga, region, during, the, 7th, century, they, became, known, as, nomadic, equestrians, in, the, volga, ural, region, but, some, researchers, say, that, their, ethnic, roots, can, be, traced, to, central, asia, they, spoke, a, form, of, turkic, as, their, main, language, the, bulgars, included, the, tribes, of, onogurs, utigurs, and, kutrigurs, among, others, the, first, clear, mention, of, the, bulgars, in, written, sources, dates, from, 480, when, they, served, as, the, allies, of, the, byzantine, emperor, zeno, r, 474, 491, against, the, ostrogoths, although, an, obscure, reference, to, ziezi, ex, quo, vulgares, with, ziezi, being, an, offspring, of, biblical, shem, son, of, noah, is, in, the, chronography, of, 354, in, the, 490s, the, kutrigurs, had, moved, west, of, the, black, sea, while, the, utigurs, inhabited, the, steppes, to, the, east, of, them, in, the, first, half, of, the, 6th, century, the, bulgars, occasionally, raided, the, byzantine, empire, but, in, the, second, half, of, the, century, the, kutrigurs, were, subjugated, by, the, avar, khaganate, and, the, utigurs, came, under, the, rule, of, the, western, turkic, khaganate, as, the, power, of, the, western, turks, faded, in, the, 600s, the, avars, reasserted, their, domination, over, the, bulgars, between, 630, and, 635, khan, kubrat, of, the, dulo, clan, managed, to, unite, the, main, bulgar, tribes, and, to, declare, independence, from, the, avars, creating, a, powerful, confederation, called, old, great, bulgaria, also, known, as, patria, onoguria, between, the, black, sea, the, sea, of, azov, and, the, caucasus, kubrat, who, was, baptised, in, constantinople, in, 619, concluded, an, alliance, with, the, byzantine, emperor, heraclius, r, 610, 641, and, the, two, countries, remained, in, good, relations, until, kubrat, s, death, between, 650, and, 665, kubrat, fought, with, the, khazars, in, the, east, but, after, his, demise, old, great, bulgaria, disintegrated, under, strong, khazar, pressure, in, 668, and, his, five, sons, parted, with, their, followers, the, eldest, batbayan, remained, in, his, homeland, as, kubrat, s, successor, and, eventually, became, a, khazar, vassal, the, second, brother, kotrag, migrated, to, the, middle, volga, region, and, founded, volga, bulgaria, the, third, brother, asparuh, led, his, people, west, to, the, lower, danube, the, fourth, one, kuber, initially, settled, in, pannonia, under, avar, suzerainty, but, revolted, and, moved, to, the, region, of, macedonia, while, the, fifth, brother, alcek, settled, in, central, italy, the, bulgars, of, asparuh, moved, westwards, to, what, is, now, bessarabia, subdued, the, territories, to, the, north, of, the, danube, in, modern, romania, and, established, themselves, in, the, danube, delta, in, the, 670s, they, crossed, the, danube, into, scythia, minor, nominally, a, byzantine, province, whose, steppe, grasslands, and, pastures, were, important, for, the, large, herd, stocks, of, the, bulgars, in, addition, to, the, grazing, grounds, to, the, west, of, the, dniester, river, already, under, their, control, in, 680, the, byzantine, emperor, constantine, iv, r, 668, 685, having, recently, defeated, the, arabs, led, an, expedition, at, the, head, of, a, huge, army, and, fleet, to, drive, off, the, bulgars, but, suffered, a, disastrous, defeat, at, the, hands, of, asparuh, at, onglos, a, swampy, region, in, or, around, the, danube, delta, where, the, bulgars, had, set, a, fortified, camp, the, bulgars, advanced, south, crossed, the, balkan, mountains, and, invaded, thrace, in, 681, the, byzantines, were, compelled, to, sign, a, humiliating, peace, treaty, forcing, them, to, acknowledge, bulgaria, as, an, independent, state, to, cede, the, territories, to, the, north, of, the, balkan, mountains, and, to, pay, an, annual, tribute, in, his, universal, chronicle, the, western, european, author, sigebert, of, gembloux, remarked, that, the, bulgarian, state, was, established, in, 680, this, was, the, first, state, that, the, empire, recognised, in, the, balkans, and, the, first, time, it, legally, surrendered, claims, to, part, of, its, balkan, dominions, the, byzantine, chronicler, theophanes, the, confessor, wrote, of, the, treaty, the, emperor, signed, peace, with, them, and, agreed, to, pay, them, tribute, for, shame, of, the, romans, and, for, our, many, sins, for, it, was, wondrous, for, faraway, and, close, peoples, to, hear, that, he, who, made, everyone, pay, him, tribute, to, the, east, and, to, the, west, to, the, north, and, to, the, south, had, been, defeated, by, these, unclean, and, newly, emerged, people, the, relations, between, the, bulgars, and, the, local, slavs, is, a, matter, of, debate, depending, on, the, interpretation, of, the, byzantine, sources, vasil, zlatarski, asserts, that, they, concluded, a, treaty, but, most, historians, agree, that, they, were, subjugated, the, bulgars, were, superior, organisationally, and, militarily, and, came, to, politically, dominate, the, new, state, but, there, was, cooperation, between, them, and, the, slavs, for, the, protection, of, the, country, the, slavs, were, allowed, to, retain, their, chiefs, to, abide, to, their, customs, and, in, return, they, were, to, pay, tribute, in, kind, and, to, provide, foot, soldiers, for, the, army, the, seven, slavic, tribes, were, relocated, to, the, west, to, protect, the, frontier, with, the, avar, khaganate, while, the, severi, were, resettled, in, the, eastern, balkan, mountains, to, guard, the, passes, to, the, byzantine, empire, the, number, of, asparuh, s, bulgars, is, difficult, to, estimate, vasil, zlatarski, and, john, van, antwerp, fine, jr, suggest, that, they, were, not, particularly, numerous, numbering, some, 10, 000, while, steven, runciman, considers, that, the, tribe, must, have, been, of, considerable, dimensions, the, bulgars, settled, mainly, in, the, north, east, establishing, the, capital, at, pliska, which, was, initially, a, colossal, encampment, of, 23, km, 2, protected, with, earthen, ramparts, to, the, north, east, the, war, with, the, khazars, persisted, and, in, 700, khan, asparuh, perished, in, battle, with, them, despite, this, setback, the, consolidation, of, the, country, continued, under, asparuh, s, successor, khan, tervel, r, 700, 721, in, 705, he, assisted, the, deposed, byzantine, emperor, justinian, ii, in, regaining, his, throne, in, return, for, the, zagore, region, of, northern, thrace, the, first, expansion, of, bulgaria, to, the, south, of, the, balkan, mountains, in, addition, tervel, obtained, the, title, caesar, and, having, been, enthroned, alongside, the, emperor, received, the, obeisance, of, the, citizenry, of, constantinople, and, numerous, gifts, however, three, years, later, justinian, tried, to, regain, the, ceded, territory, by, force, but, his, army, was, defeated, at, anchialus, skirmishes, continued, until, 716, when, khan, tervel, signed, an, important, agreement, with, byzantium, that, defined, the, borders, and, the, byzantine, tribute, regulated, trade, relations, and, provided, for, the, exchange, of, prisoners, and, fugitives, when, the, arabs, laid, siege, to, constantinople, in, 717, 718, tervel, dispatched, his, army, to, help, the, besieged, city, in, the, decisive, battle, before, the, walls, of, constantinople, the, bulgarians, slaughtered, between, 22, 000, and, 30, 000, arabs, forcing, them, to, abandon, the, undertaking, most, historians, primarily, attribute, the, byzantine, bulgarian, victory, with, stopping, the, arab, offensives, against, europe, with, the, demise, of, khan, sevar, r, 738, 753, the, ruling, dulo, clan, died, out, and, the, khanate, fell, into, a, long, political, crisis, during, which, the, young, country, was, on, the, verge, of, destruction, in, just, fifteen, years, seven, khans, reigned, and, all, of, them, were, murdered, the, only, surviving, sources, of, this, period, are, byzantine, and, present, only, the, byzantine, point, of, view, of, the, ensuing, political, turmoil, in, bulgaria, they, describe, two, factions, struggling, for, power, one, that, sought, peaceful, relations, with, the, empire, which, was, dominant, until, 755, and, one, that, favoured, war, these, sources, present, the, relations, with, the, byzantine, empire, as, the, main, issue, in, this, internal, struggle, and, do, not, mention, the, other, reasons, which, could, have, been, more, important, for, the, bulgarian, elite, it, is, likely, that, the, relationship, between, the, politically, dominant, bulgars, and, the, more, numerous, slavs, was, the, main, issue, behind, the, struggle, but, there, is, no, evidence, about, the, aims, of, the, rival, factions, zlatarski, speculates, that, the, old, bulgar, military, aristocracy, was, leaning, towards, war, while, other, bulgars, supported, by, the, majority, of, the, slavs, were, inclined, for, peace, with, byzantium, the, internal, instability, was, used, by, the, soldier, emperor, constantine, v, r, 741, 775, who, launched, nine, major, campaigns, aiming, to, eliminate, bulgaria, having, contained, the, arab, threat, during, the, first, part, of, his, reign, constantine, v, was, able, to, concentrate, his, forces, on, bulgaria, after, 755, he, defeated, the, bulgarians, at, marcellae, in, 756, anchialus, in, 763, and, berzitia, in, 774, but, lost, the, battle, of, the, rishki, pass, in, 759, in, addition, to, hundreds, of, ships, lost, to, storms, in, the, black, sea, the, byzantine, military, successes, further, exacerbated, the, crisis, in, bulgaria, but, also, rallied, together, many, different, factions, to, resist, the, byzantines, as, shown, at, the, council, of, 766, when, the, nobility, and, the, armed, people, denounced, khan, sabin, with, the, words, thanks, to, you, the, romans, will, enslave, bulgaria, in, 774, khan, telerig, r, 768, 777, tricked, constantine, v, into, revealing, his, spies, at, the, bulgarian, court, in, pliska, and, had, them, all, executed, the, next, year, constantine, v, died, during, a, retaliatory, campaign, against, bulgaria, despite, being, able, to, defeat, the, bulgarians, several, times, the, byzantines, were, able, neither, to, conquer, bulgaria, nor, to, impose, their, suzerainty, and, a, lasting, peace, which, is, a, testimony, to, the, resilience, fighting, skills, and, ideological, coherence, of, the, bulgarian, state, the, devastation, brought, to, the, country, by, the, nine, campaigns, of, constantine, v, firmly, rallied, the, slavs, behind, the, bulgars, and, greatly, increased, the, dislike, of, the, byzantines, turning, bulgaria, into, a, hostile, neighbour, the, hostilities, continued, until, 792, when, khan, kardam, r, 777, 803, achieved, an, important, victory, in, the, battle, of, marcellae, forcing, the, byzantines, once, again, to, pay, tribute, to, the, khans, as, a, result, of, the, victory, the, crisis, was, finally, overcome, and, bulgaria, entered, the, new, century, stable, stronger, and, consolidated, during, the, reign, of, krum, r, 803, 814, bulgaria, doubled, in, size, and, expanded, to, the, south, west, and, north, occupying, the, vast, lands, along, the, middle, danube, and, transylvania, becoming, european, medieval, great, power, during, the, 9th, and, 10th, century, along, with, the, byzantine, and, frankish, empires, between, 804, and, 806, the, bulgarian, armies, thoroughly, eliminated, the, avar, khaganate, which, had, suffered, a, crippling, blow, by, the, franks, in, 796, and, a, border, with, the, frankish, empire, was, established, along, the, middle, danube, or, tisza, prompted, by, the, byzantine, moves, to, consolidate, their, hold, on, the, slavs, in, macedonia, and, northern, greece, and, in, response, to, a, byzantine, raid, against, the, country, the, bulgarians, confronted, the, byzantine, empire, in, 808, they, raided, the, valley, of, the, struma, river, defeating, a, byzantine, army, and, in, 809, captured, the, important, city, of, serdica, modern, sofia, in, 811, the, byzantine, emperor, nicephorus, i, launched, a, massive, offensive, against, bulgaria, and, seized, plundered, and, burned, down, the, capital, pliska, but, on, the, way, back, the, byzantine, army, was, decisively, defeated, in, the, battle, of, the, varbitsa, pass, nicephorus, i, himself, was, slain, along, with, most, of, his, troops, and, his, skull, was, lined, with, silver, and, used, as, a, drinking, cup, krum, took, the, initiative, and, in, 812, moved, the, war, towards, thrace, capturing, the, key, black, sea, port, of, messembria, and, defeating, the, byzantines, once, more, at, versinikia, in, 813, before, proposing, a, generous, peace, settlement, however, during, the, negotiations, the, byzantines, attempted, to, assassinate, krum, in, response, the, bulgarians, pillaged, eastern, thrace, and, seized, the, important, city, of, adrianople, resettling, its, 10, 000, inhabitants, in, bulgaria, across, the, danube, krum, made, extensive, preparations, to, capture, constantinople, 5, 000, iron, plated, wagons, were, built, to, carry, the, siege, equipment, the, byzantines, even, pleaded, for, help, from, the, frankish, emperor, louis, the, pious, due, to, the, sudden, death, of, krum, on, 14, april, 814, however, the, campaign, was, never, launched, khan, krum, implemented, legal, reforms, and, issued, the, first, known, written, law, code, of, bulgaria, that, established, equal, rules, for, all, peoples, living, within, the, country, s, boundaries, intending, to, reduce, poverty, and, to, strengthen, the, social, ties, in, his, vastly, enlarged, state, krum, s, successor, khan, omurtag, r, 814, 831, concluded, a, 30, year, peace, treaty, with, the, byzantines, establishing, the, border, along, the, erkesia, trench, between, debeltos, on, the, black, sea, and, the, valley, of, the, maritsa, river, at, kalugerovo, thus, allowing, both, countries, to, restore, their, economies, and, finance, after, the, bloody, conflicts, in, the, first, decade, of, the, century, to, the, west, the, bulgarians, were, in, control, of, belgrade, whose, modern, name, was, first, known, as, alba, bulgarica, by, the, 820s, and, the, northwestern, boundaries, with, the, frankish, empire, were, firmly, settled, along, the, middle, danube, by, 827, to, the, north, east, omurtag, fought, the, khazars, along, the, dnieper, river, which, was, the, easternmost, limit, of, bulgaria, extensive,

conclusion, that, the, expansion, was, largely, peaceful, with, this, bulgaria, had, become, the, dominant, power, in, the, balkans, the, advance, further, west, was, blocked, by, the, development, of, a, new, slavic, state, under, byzantine, patronage, the, principality, of, serbia, between, 839, and, 842, the, bulgarians, waged, war, on, the, serbs, but, did, not, make, any, progress,

setbacks, and, natural, disasters, the, skilful, diplomacy, of, boris, i, prevented, any, territorial, losses, and, kept, the, realm, intact, in, this, complex, international, situation, christianity, had, become, attractive, as, a, religion, by, the, mid, 9th, century, because, it, provided, better, opportunities, for, forging, reliable, alliances, and, diplomatic, ties, taking, this, into, account, as, well, as, a, variety, of, internal, factors, boris, i, converted, to, christianity, in, 864, assuming, the, title, knyaz, prince, taking, advantage, of, the, struggle, between, the, papacy, in, rome, and, the, ecumenical, patriarchate, of, constantinople, boris, i, brilliantly, manoeuvred, to, assert, the, independence, of, the, newly, established, bulgarian, church, to, check, the, possibility, of, byzantine, interference, in, the, internal, matters, of, bulgaria, he, sponsored, the, disciples, of, the, brothers, cyril, and, methodius, to, create, literature, in, old, bulgarian, language, boris, i, dealt, ruthlessly, with, the, opposition, to, the, christianisation, of, bulgaria, crushing, a, revolt, of, the, nobility, in, 866, and, overthrowing, his, own, son,

favoured, nation, basis, the, new, prince, simeon, i, r, 893, 927, who, came, to, be, known, as, simeon, the, great, declared, war, and, defeated, the, byzantine, army, in, thrace, the, byzantines,

dobrudzha, but, simeon, i, allied, with, the, pechenegs, further, east, and, in, 895, the, bulgarian, army, inflicted, a, crushing, defeat, on, the, magyars, in, the, steppes, along, the, southern, bug, river, at, the, same, time, the, pechenegs, advanced, westwards, and, prevented, the, magyars, from, returning, to, their, homeland, the, blow, was, so, heavy, that, the, magyars, were, forced, to, migrate, west, eventually, settling, in, the, pannonian, basin, where, they, eventually, established, the, kingdom, of, hungary, in, 896, the, byzantines, were, routed, in, the, decisive, battle, of, boulgarophygon, and, pleaded, for, peace, that, confirmed, the, bulgarian, domination, of, the, balkans, restored, the, status, of, bulgaria, as, a, most, favoured, nation, abolished, the, commercial, restrictions, and, obliged, the, byzantine, empire, to, pay, annual, tribute, the, peace, treaty, remained, in, force, until, 912, although, simeon, i, did, violate, it, following, the, sack, of, thessaloniki, in, 904, extracting, further, territorial, concessions, in, macedonia, in, 913, the, byzantine, emperor, alexander, provoked, a, bitter, war, after, resolving, to, discontinue, paying, an, annual, tribute, to, bulgaria, however, the, military, and, ideological, initiative, was, held, by, simeon, i, who, was, seeking, casus, belli, to, fulfil, his, ambition, to, be, recognized, as, emperor, in, bulgarian, tsar, and, to, conquer, constantinople, creating, a, joint, bulgarian, roman, state, in, 917, the, bulgarian, army, dealt, a, crushing, defeat, to, the, byzantines, at, the, battle, of, achelous, resulting, in, bulgaria, s, total, military, supremacy, in, the, balkans, in, the, words, of, theophanes, continuatus, a, bloodshed, occurred, that, had,

further, victories, at, katasyrtai, in, 917, pegae, in, 921, and, constantinople, in, 922, the, bulgarians, also, captured, the, important, city, of, adrianople, in, thrace, and, seized, the, capital, of, the, theme, of, hellas, thebes, deep, in, southern, greece, following, the, disaster, at, achelous, byzantine, diplomacy, incited, the, principality, of, serbia, to, attack, bulgaria, from, the, west, but, this, assault, was, easily, contained, in, 924, the, serbs, ambushed, and, defeated, a, small, bulgarian, army, provoking, a, major, retaliatory, campaign, that, ended, with, bulgaria, s, annexation, of, serbia, at, the, end, of, that, year, further, expansion, in, the, western, balkans, was, checked, by, king, tomislav, of, croatia, who, was, a, byzantine, ally, and, defeated, a, bulgarian, invasion, in, 926, simeon, i, was, aware, that, he, needed, naval, support, to, conquer, constantinople, and, in, 922, sent, envoys, to, the, fatimid, caliph, ubayd, allah, al, mahdi,

en, route, by, the, byzantines, near, the, calabrian, coast, the, byzantine, emperor, romanos, i, lekapenos, managed, to, avert, a, bulgarian, arab, alliance, by, showering, the, arabs, with, generous, gifts, the, war, dragged, on, until, simeon, i, s, death, in, may, 927, by, then, bulgaria, controlled, almost, all, byzantine, possessions, in, the, balkans, but, without, a, fleet, it, did, not, attempt, to, storm, constantinople, both, countries, were, exhausted, by, the, huge, military, efforts, that, had, taken, a, heavy, toll, on, the, population, and, economy, simeon, s, successor, peter, i, r, 927, 969, negotiated, a, favourable, peace, treaty, the, byzantines, agreed, to, recognize, him, as, emperor, of, bulgaria, and, the, bulgarian, orthodox, church, as, an, independent, patriarchate, as, well, as, to, pay, an, annual, tribute, the, peace, was, reinforced, with, a, marriage, between, peter, and, romanos, s, granddaughter, irene, lekapene, this, agreement, ushered, in, a, period, of, 40, years, of, peaceful, relations, between, the, two, powers, during, the, first, years, of, his, reign, peter, i, faced, revolts, by, two, of, his, three, brothers, john, in, 928, and, michael, in, 930, but, both, were, quelled, during, most, of, his, subsequent, rule, until, 965, peter, i, presided, over, a, golden, age, of, the, bulgarian, state, in, a, period, of, political, consolidation, economic, expansion, and, cultural, activity, despite, the, treaty, and, the, largely, peaceful, era, that, followed, the, strategic, position, of, the, bulgarian, empire, remained, difficult, the, country, was, surrounded, by, aggressive, neighbours, the, magyars, to, the, north, west, the, pechenegs, and, the, growing, power, of, kievan, rus, to, the, north, east, and, the, byzantine, empire, to, the, south, bulgaria, suffered, several, devastating, magyar, raids, between, 934, and, 965, the, growing, insecurity, as, well, as, expanding, influence, of, the, landed, nobility, and, the, higher, clergy, at, the, expense, of, the, personal, privileges, of, the, peasantry, led, to, the, emergence, of, bogomilism, a, dualistic, heretic, sect, that, in, the, subsequent, centuries, spread, to, the, byzantine, empire, northern, italy, and, southern, france, cf, cathars, to, the, south, the, byzantine, empire, reversed, the, course, of, the, byzantine, arab, wars, against, the, declining, abbasid, caliphate, and, in, 965, discontinued, the, payment, of, the, tribute, leading, to, sharp, deterioration, in, their, relations, in, 968, the, byzantines, incited, kievan, rus, to, invade, bulgaria, in, two, years, the, kievan, prince, svyatoslav, i, defeated, the, bulgarian, army, captured, preslav, and, established, his, capital, at, the, important, bulgarian, city, of, preslavets, meaning, little, preslav, in, this, desperate, situation, the, aging, peter, i, abdicated, leaving, the, crown, to, his, son, boris, ii, r, 969, 971, who, had, little, choice, but, to, cooperate, with, svyatoslav, the, unexpected, success, of, the, rus, campaigns, led, to, a, confrontation, with, the, byzantine, empire, the, byzantine, emperor, john, i, tzimiskes, eventually, defeated, svyatoslav, s, forces, and, compelled, him, to, leave, the, balkans, in, 971, in, the, course, of, their, campaign, the, byzantines, seized, preslav, and, detained, boris, ii, initially, john, i, tzimiskes, presented, himself, as, a, liberator, but, boris, ii, was, promptly, forced, to, ritually, abdicate, in, constantinople, although, at, the, time, the, byzantines, controlled, only, the, eastern, regions, of, the, country, bulgaria, was, proclaimed, a, byzantine, province, the, lands, to, the, west, of, the, iskar, river, remained, free, and, the, bulgarians, were, able, to, regroup, headed, by, the, four, cometopuli, brothers, by, 976, the, youngest, of, them, samuel, concentrated, all, power, in, his, hands, following, the, death, of, his, elder, siblings, when, in, 976, the, rightful, heir, to, the, throne, boris, ii, s, brother, roman, r, 971, 997, escaped, from, captivity, in, constantinople, he, was, recognized, as, emperor, by, samuel, who, remained, the, chief, commander, of, the, bulgarian, army, peace, was, impossible, as, a, result, of, the, symbolic, ending, of, the, bulgarian, empire, following, boris, ii, s, abdication, roman, and, later, samuel, were, seen, as, rebels, and, the, byzantine, emperor, was, bound, to, enforce, the, imperial, sovereignty, over, them, this, led, to, more, than, 40, years, of, increasingly, bitter, warfare, a, capable, general, and, good, politician, at, first, samuel, managed, to, turn, the, fortunes, to, the, bulgarians, the, new, byzantine, emperor, basil, ii, was, decisively, defeated, in, the, battle, of, the, gates, of, trajan, in, 986, and, barely, escaped, with, his, life, the, byzantine, poet, john, geometres, wrote, of, the, defeat, even, if, the, sun, would, have, come, down, i, would, have, never, thought, that, the, moesian, arrows, were, stronger, than, the, ausonian, spears, and, when, you, phaethon, descend, to, the, earth, with, your, gold, shining, chariot, tell, the, great, soul, of, the, caesar, the, istros, took, the, crown, of, rome, take, up, arms, the, arrows, of, the, moesians, broke, the, spears, of, the, ausonians, immediately, after, the, victory, samuel, pushed, east, and, recovered, north, eastern, bulgaria, along, with, the, old, capitals, pliska, and, preslav, in, the, next, ten, years, the, bulgarian, armies, expanded, the, country, south, annexing, the, whole, of, thessaly, and, epirus, and, plundering, the, peloponnese, peninsula, with, the, major, bulgarian, military, successes, and, the, defection, of, a, number, of, byzantine, officials, to, the, bulgarians, the, prospect, of, the, byzantines, losing, all, their, balkan, themes, was, quite, real, threatened, by, an, alliance, between, the, byzantines, and, the, serbian, state, of, duklja, in, 997, samuel, defeated, and, captured, its, prince, jovan, vladimir, and, took, control, of, the, serb, lands, in, 997, following, the, death, of, roman, the, last, heir, of, the, krum, s, dynasty, samuel, was, proclaimed, emperor, of, bulgaria, he, established, friendly, relations, with, stephen, i, of, hungary, through, a, marriage, between, his, son, and, heir, gavril, radomir, and, stephen, s, daughter, but, eventually, gavril, radomir, expelled, his, wife, and, in, 1004, hungary, participated, with, the, byzantine, forces, against, bulgaria, after, 1000, the, tides, of, the, war, turned, in, favor, of, the, byzantines, under, the, personal, leadership, of, basil, ii, who, launched, annual, campaigns, of, methodical, conquest, of, the, bulgarian, cities, and, strongholds, that, were, sometimes, carried, out, in, all, twelve, months, of, the, year, instead, of, the, usual, short, campaigning, of, the, epoch, with, the, troops, returning, home, to, winter, in, 1001, they, seized, pliska, and, preslav, in, the, east, in, 1003, a, major, offensive, along, the, danube, resulted, in, the, fall, of, vidin, after, an, eight, month, siege, and, in, 1004, basil, ii, defeated, samuel, in, the, battle, of, skopje, and, took, possession, of, the, city, this, war, of, attrition, dragged, on, for, a, decade, until, 1014, when, the, bulgarians, were, decisively, defeated, at, kleidion, some, 14, 000, bulgarians, were, captured, it, is, said, that, 99, out, of, every, 100, men, were, blinded, with, the, remaining, hundredth, man, left, with, one, eye, so, as, to, lead, his, compatriots, home, earning, basil, ii, the, moniker, bulgaroktonos, the, bulgar, killer, when, the, returning, men, arrived, in, samuel, s, residence, in, prespa, the, bulgarian, emperor, suffered, a, heart, attack, at, the, grisly, sight, and, died, two, days, later, on, 6, october, resistance, continued, for, four, more, years, under, gavril, radomir, r, 1014, 1015, and, ivan, vladislav, r, 1015, 1018, but, after, the, demise, of, the, latter, during, the, siege, of, dyrrhachium, the, nobility, surrendered, to, basil, ii, and, bulgaria, was, annexed, by, the, byzantine, empire, the, bulgarian, aristocracy, kept, its, privileges, although, many, noblemen, were, transferred, to, asia, minor, thus, depriving, the, bulgarians, of, their, natural, leaders, although, the, bulgarian, patriarchate, was, demoted, to, the, archbishopric, of, justiniana, prima, and, all, bulgaria, archbishopric, of, ohrid, it, retained, its, sees, and, enjoyed, a, privileged, autonomy, despite, several, major, attempts, at, restoring, its, independence, bulgaria, remained, under, byzantine, rule, until, the, brothers, asen, and, peter, liberated, the, country, in, 1185, establishing, the, second, bulgarian, empire, the, first, bulgarian, empire, was, a, hereditary, monarchy, the, monarch, was, the, commander, in, chief, of, the, armed, forces, a, judge, and, a, high, priest, during, the, pagan, period, he, guided, the, external, policy, of, the, country, and, could, conclude, treaties, personally, or, through, authorised, emissaries, in, the, pagan, period, the, title, of, the, ruler, was, khan, after, 864, boris, i, adopted, the, slavic, knyaz, prince, and, since, 913, the, bulgarian, monarchs, were, recognised, as, tsars, emperors, the, authority, of, the, khan, was, limited, by, the, leading, noble, families, and, the, people, s, council, the, people, s, council, which, included, the, nobility, and, the, armed, people, was, gathered, to, discuss, issues, of, crucial, importance, for, the, state, a, people, s, council, in, 766, dethroned, khan, sabin, because, he, was, seeking, peace, with, the, byzantines, according, to, the, old, bulgarian, tradition, the, khan, was, first, among, equals, which, was, among, the, reasons, why, boris, i, decided, to, convert, to, christianity, as, christian, monarchs, ruled, by, the, grace, of, god, however, the, divinity, of, the, bulgarian, ruler, as, well, as, his, superiority, over, the, byzantine, emperor, were, already, asserted, by, khan, omurtag, r, 814, 831, as, stated, in, the, chatalar, inscription, the, kanasubigi, omurtag, is, a, divine, ruler, in, the, land, where, he, was, born, may, god, grant, that, the, divine, ruler, may, press, down, the, emperor, with, his, foot, so, long, as, the, ticha, flows, the, second, most, important, post, in, bulgaria, after, the, monarch, was, the, kavhan, monopolised, by, the, members, of, the, tentatively, known, kavhan, family, the, kavhan, had, broad, powers, and, commanded, the, left, wing, of, the, army, and, at, times, the, whole, army, he, could, be, a, co, ruler, or, a, regent, during, the, minority, of, the, monarch, the, sources, mention, that, khan, malamir, ruled, together, with, kavhan, isbul, fl, 820s, 830s, and, kavhan, dometian, is, noted, as, an, associate, of, gavril, radomir, r, 1014, 1015, the, third, highest, ranking, official, was, the, ichirgu, boila, who, commanded, the, right, wing, of, the, army, at, war, and, might, have, had, the, role, of, a, foreign, minister, under, his, direct, command, were, 1, 300, soldiers, historian, veselin, beshevliev, assumes, that, the, post, might, have, been, created, under, the, reign, of, khan, krum, r, 803, 814, or, earlier, in, order, to, limit, the, power, of, the, kavhan, although, initially, the, bulgarians, did, not, have, their, own, writing, system, the, presence, of, numerous, stone, inscriptions, mainly, in, greek, indicate, the, existence, of, a, chancellery, to, the, khan, that, was, probably, organised, in, the, byzantine, manner, part, of, the, chancellery, s, staff, might, have, been, greeks, and, even, monks, despite, the, fact, that, the, country, was, still, pagan, according, to, an, inscription, dated, from, the, reign, of, khan, malamir, r, 831, 836, there, were, three, classes, in, pagan, bulgaria, boilas, bagains, and, bulgarians, i, e, the, common, people, the, nobility, were, initially, known, as, the, boila, but, after, the, 10th, century, the, word, was, transformed, to, bolyar, which, was, eventually, adopted, in, many, countries, in, eastern, europe, each, boila, clan, had, its, own, totem, and, was, believed, to, have, been, divinely, established, hence, their, staunch, opposition, to, christianity, which, was, seen, as, a, threat, to, their, privileges, many, of, the, clans, had, ancient, origin, that, could, be, traced, back, to, the, time, when, the, bulgars, inhabited, the, steppes, to, the, north, and, east, of, the, black, sea, the, nominalia, of, the, bulgarian, khans, mentions, monarchs, of, three, clans, that, ruled, bulgaria, until, 766, dulo, vokil, and, ugain, the, power, of, the, principal, noble, families, was, greatly, crippled, in, the, aftermath, of, the, anti, christian, rebellion, of, 866, when, boris, i, executed, 52, leading, boilas, along, with, their, families, the, boila, were, divided, into, inner, and, outer, boilas, and, it, was, among, their, ranks, that, the, holders, of, the, highest, military, and, administrative, posts, were, selected, most, likely, the, outer, boilas, resided, outside, the, capital, while, the, inner, ones, were, member, of, the, court, under, the, direct, influence, of, the, monarch, the, bagains, were, the, second, ranking, aristocratic, class, and, were, divided, into, numerous, sub, ranks, the, presence, of, two, separate, classes, of, nobility, is, further, confirmed, in, the, responsa, nicolai, ad, consulta, bulgarorum, responses, of, pope, nicholas, i, to, the, questions, of, the, bulgarians, where, boris, i, wrote, about, primates, and, mediocres, seu, minores, another, privileged, group, were, the, tarkhans, although, from, the, surviving, inscriptions, it, is, impossible, to, determine, whether, they, belonged, to, the, boilas, or, to, the, bagains, or, were, a, separate, class, the, original, bulgar, titles, and, many, of, the, institutions, from, the, pagan, era, were, preserved, after, the, christianisation, of, bulgaria, until, the, very, fall, of, the, first, empire, the, beginning, of, the, 9th, century, was, marked, with, a, process, of, incorporation, of, both, slavs, and, byzantine, greeks, in, the, ranks, of, the, bulgarian, nobility, and, privileged, classes, which, increased, the, power, of, the, monarch, that, had, been, previously, curtailed, by, the, leading, bulgar, aristocratic, families, since, that, time, certain, slavic, titles, became, more, prominent, such, as, upan, and, some, of, them, mingled, forming, titles, like, upan, tarkhan, the, peasants, lived, in, rural, communities, known, as, zadruga, and, had, collective, responsibility, the, majority, of, the, peasantry, were, personally, free, under, the, direct, rule, of, the, central, administration, and, the, legislation, introduced, following, the, adoption, of, christianity, regulated, their, relations, the, number, of, personally, dependent, peasants, bound, to, nobility, or, ecclesiastical, estates, increased, since, the, 10th, century, due, to, the, limited, remaining, sources, it, is, very, difficult, to, reconstruct, the, administrative, evolution, and, division, of, the, country, initially, the, slavic, tribes, retained, their, autonomy, but, since, the, beginning, of, the, 9th, century, commenced, a, process, of, centralisation, as, bulgaria, s, territory, steadily, expanded, measures, against, tribal, autonomy, were, deemed, necessary, in, order, to, achieve, more, effective, control, and, to, prevent, separatism, when, in, the, 820s, some, slavic, tribes, in, western, bulgaria, the, timochani, branichevtsi, and, abodriti, sought, overlordship, from, the, franks, khan, omurtag, replaced, their, chieftains, with, his, own, governors, the, country, was, divided, into, comitati, governed, by, a, comita, although, this, term, was, used, by, western, european, chroniclers, who, wrote, in, latin, it, is, likely, that, the, bulgarians, used, the, term, zemya, meaning, land, as, mentioned, in, the, court, law, for, the, people, their, number, is, unknown, but, the, archbishop, of, reims, hincmar, mentioned, that, the, 866, rebellion, against, boris, i, was, headed, by, the, nobility, of, the, 10, comitati, they, were, further, divided, into, upi, that, in, turn, consisted, of, zadrugi, the, comita, was, appointed, by, the, monarch, and, was, assisted, by, a, tarkhan, the, former, had, many, civil, and, administrative, functions, while, the, latter, was, responsible, for, military, affairs, one, of, the, few, comitati, known, by, name, was, kutmichevitsa, in, south, western, bulgaria, corresponding, to, modern, western, macedonia, southern, albania, and, north, western, greece, the, first, known, written, bulgarian, law, code, was, issued, by, khan, krum, at, a, people, s, council, in, the, very, beginning, of, the, 9th, century, but, the, text, has, not, survived, in, its, entirety, and, only, certain, items, have, been, preserved, in, the, 10th, century, byzantine, encyclopedia, suda, it, prescribed, the, death, penalty, for, false, oaths, and, accusations, and, severe, penalties, for, thieves, and, those, who, gave, them, shelter, the, suda, also, mentioned, that, the, laws, foresaw, the, uprooting, of, all, vineyards, as, a, measure, against, drunkenness, but, this, claim, is, refuted, in, the, contemporary, sources, which, indicate, that, after, capturing, pliska, in, 811, the, byzantine, emperor, nicephorus, i, found, large, quantities, of, wine, and, after, the, final, bulgarian, victory, krum, drank, wine, in, the, emperor, s, skull, krum, s, legal, code, is, seen, by, many, historians, as, an, attempt, to, centralise, the, state, and, to, homogenize, society, by, putting, the, different, elements, under, a, single, code, of, laws, however, since, the, text, is, not, preserved, its, precise, aims, remain, unknown, after, the, conversion, to, christianity, boris, i, was, concerned, with, the, legal, matters, and, asked, pope, nicholas, i, to, provide, legal, texts, eventually, the, zakon, sudnyi, ljud, m, court, law, for, the, people, was, compiled, based, heavily, on, the, byzantine, ecloga, and, nomocanon, but, adapted, to, bulgarian, conditions, and, valid, for, the, whole, population, of, the, country, it, combined, elements, of, civil, criminal, canon, and, military, law, as, well, as, public, and, private, law, and, included, substantive, norms, and, procedural, guidelines, the, court, law, for, the, people, dealt, with, combating, paganism, testimony, of, witnesses, sexual, morality, marital, relations, distribution, of, war, booty, etc, to, eradicate, the, residual, paganism, the, law, provided, that, a, village, that, allowed, performance, of, pagan, rituals, should, be, transferred, in, its, entirety, to, the, church, and, should, a, rich, landowner, perform, them, his, lands, were, to, be, sold, and, the, revenue, shared, among, the, poor, after, the, formation, of, the, bulgarian, state, the, ruling, elite, harboured, deep, distrust, towards, the, byzantines, against, whose, perfidy, and, sudden, attacks, they, had, to, maintain, constant, vigilance, in, all, directions, the, byzantine, empire, never, relinquished, its, claim, over, all, lands, to, the, south, of, the, danube, and, made, several, attempts, to, enforce, that, claim, throughout, the, existence, of, the, first, empire, bulgaria, could, expect, byzantine, onslaughts, aimed, at, its, destruction, the, steppes, to, the, north, east, were, home, to, numerous, peoples, whose, unpredictable, pillaging, raids, were, also, of, concern, therefore, military, preparedness, was, a, top, priority, guards, always, stood, on, the, alert, and, if, anyone, was, to, flee, during, a, watch, the, responsible, guards, are, killed, without, hesitation, before, battle, a, most, faithful, and, prudent, man, was, sent, to, inspect, all, the, arms, horses, and, materiel, and, being, ill, prepared, or, readied, in, a, useless, fashion, was, punishable, by, death, capital, punishment, was, also, prescribed, for, riding, war, horses, in, peacetime, the, bulgarian, army, was, armed, with, various, types, of, weapons, the, most, widely, used, being, sabres, swords, battle, axes, spears, pikes, daggers, arkans, and, bows, and, arrows, the, soldiers, were, often, trained, to, use, both, spears, and, bows, the, bulgarians, wore, helms, mail, armor, and, shields, for, defence, the, helms, were, usually, cone, shaped, while, the, shields, were, round, and, light, the, armor, was, of, two, types, wedge, riveted, mail, consisting, of, small, metal, rings, linked, together, and, scale, armour, consisting, of, small, armour, plates, attached, to, each, other, belts, were, very, important, for, the, early, bulgarians, and, were, often, decorated, with, golden, silver, bronze, or, copper, buckles, that, reflected, the, illustrious, origin, of, the, holder, the, most, important, part, of, the, army, was, the, heavy, cavalry, in, the, early, 9th, century, the, bulgarian, khan, could, muster, 30, 000, riders, all, covered, in, iron, who, were, armoured, with, iron, helms, and, chainmail, the, horses, too, were, covered, with, armour, as, the, capital, pliska, was, situated, in, an, open, plain, the, cavalry, was, essential, for, its, protection, the, fortification, system, of, the, inner, regions, of, the, country, was, reinforced, with, several, fortified, trenches, covering, huge, spaces, and, supporting, the, manoeuvrability, of, the, cavalry, the, army, was, well, versed, in, the, use, of, stratagems, a, strong, cavalry, unit, was, often, held, in, reserve, and, would, attack, the, enemy, at, an, opportune, moment, free, horses, would, be, sometimes, concentrated, behind, the, battle, formation, to, avoid, surprise, attacks, from, the, rear, the, bulgarian, army, used, ambushes, and, feigned, retreats, during, which, the, cavalrymen, rode, with, their, backs, to, the, horse, firing, clouds, of, arrows, on, the, enemy, if, the, enemy, pursued, disorganized, they, would, turn, back, and, fiercely, attack, them, in, 918, the, bulgarians, took, the, capital, of, the, byzantine, theme, hellas, thebes, without, bloodshed, after, sending, five, men, with, axes, into, the, city, who, eliminated, the, guards, broke, the, hinges, of, the, gates, and, opened, them, to, the, main, forces, the, bulgarians, were, also, able, to, fight, at, night, e, g, their, victory, over, the, byzantines, in, the, battle, of, katasyrtai, the, bulgarian, army, was, well, equipped, with, siege, engines, the, bulgarians, employed, the, services, of, byzantine, and, arab, captives, and, fugitives, to, produce, siege, equipment, such, as, the, engineer, eumathius, who, sought, refuge, with, khan, krum, after, the, capture, of, serdica, in, 809, the, 9th, century, anonymous, byzantine, chronicler, known, as, scrptor, incertus, lists, the, contemporary, machinery, produced, and, used, by, the, bulgarians, these, included, catapults, scorpions, multi, storey, siege, towers, with, a, battering, ram, on, the, bottom, floor, testudos, battering, rams, with, metal, plating, on, the, top, iron, tridents, placed, hidden, amidst, the, battlefield, to, hinder, the, enemy, cavalry, ladders, etc, iron, plated, wagons, were, used, for, transportation, it, is, known, that, khan, krum, prepared, 5, 000, such, wagons, for, his, intended, siege, of, constantinople, in, 814, wooden, pontoon, bridges, were, also, constructed, for, crossing, rivers, agriculture, was, the, most, important, sector, of, the, economy, the, development, of, which, was, facilitated, by, the, fertile, soils, of, moesia, thrace, and, partly, macedonia, the, land, was, divided, into, lord, s, lands, and, village, lands, the, most, widespread, cereals, were, wheat, rye, and, millet, all, of, which, were, staple, foods, for, the, populace, grapes, were, also, significant, especially, after, the, 9th, century, linen, was, used, for, fabrics, and, cloths, that, were, exported, to, the, byzantine, empire, harvests, were, prone, to, natural, calamities, such, as, droughts, or, locusts, and, there, were, occasional, hunger, years, in, response, to, this, problem, the, state, maintained, reserves, of, cereals, animal, husbandry, was, well, developed, the, main, stocks, being, cattle, oxen, buffalos, sheep, pigs, and, horses, animal, stocks, were, vital, for, farming, transport, military, clothing, and, food, the, importance, of, the, meat, for, the, bulgarian, table, was, demonstrated, in, the, responses, of, pope, nicholas, i, to, the, questions, of, the, bulgarians, where, seven, out, of, 115, questions, concerned, meat, consumption, small, scale, mining, was, developed, in, the, balkan, mountains, the, rhodope, mountains, and, some, regions, of, macedonia, a, number, of, diverse, handicrafts, thrived, in, the, urban, centres, and, some, villages, preslav, had, workshops, that, processed, metals, especially, gold, and, silver, stone, and, wood, and, produced, ceramics, glass, and, jewellery, the, bulgarians, produced, higher, quality, tiles, than, the, byzantines, and, exported, them, to, the, byzantine, empire, and, kievan, rus, there, was, large, scale, production, of, bricks, in, eastern, bulgaria, many, of, them, marked, with, the, symbol, iyi, which, is, associated, with, the, bulgarian, state, indicating, possible, state, organised, production, facilities, after, the, destruction, of, the, avar, khaganate, in, the, beginning, of, the, 9th, century, bulgaria, controlled, the, salt, mines, in, transylvania, until, they, were, overrun, by, the, magyars, a, century, later, the, importance, of, the, salt, trade, was, illustrated, during, the, negotiations, for, alliance, between, bulgaria, and, east, francia, in, 892, when, the, frankish, king, arnulf, demanded, that, bulgaria, discontinue, the, export, of, salt, to, great, moravia, trade, was, particularly, important, to, the, economy, as, bulgaria, lay, between, the, byzantine, empire, central, europe, the, rus, and, the, steppes, trade, relations, with, the, byzantine, empire, were, regulated, on, a, most, favoured, nation, basis, by, treaties, that, included, commercial, clauses, the, first, such, treaty, was, signed, in, 716, and, provided, that, goods, could, only, be, imported, or, exported, when, embossed, with, a, state, seal, goods, without, documents, were, to, be, confiscated, for, the, state, treasury, the, bulgarian, merchants, had, a, colony, in, constantinople, and, paid, favourable, taxes, the, relevance, of, international, trade, for, bulgaria, was, evident, as, the, country, was, willing, to, go, to, war, with, the, byzantine, empire, when, in, 894, the, latter, moved, the, market, of, the, bulgarian, traders, from, constantinople, to, thessaloniki, where, they, had, to, pay, higher, taxes, and, did, not, have, direct, access, to, goods, from, the, east, in, 896, bulgaria, won, the, war, restoring, its, status, as, a, most, favoured, nation, and, lifting, the, commercial, restrictions, some, bulgarian, towns, were, very, prosperous, e, g, preslavets, on, the, danube, described, in, the, 960s, as, more, prosperous, than, the, capital, of, the, rus, kiev, a, contemporary, chronicle, lists, the, main, trade, partners, and, chief, imports, to, bulgaria, the, country, imported, gold, silks, wine, and, fruits, from, the, byzantine, empire, silver, and, horses, from, hungary, and, bohemia, furs, honey, wax, and, slaves, from, the, rus, there, were, commercial, ties, with, italy, and, the, middle, east, as, well, the, first, bulgarian, empire, did, not, mint, coins, and, taxes, were, paid, in, kind, it, is, not, known, whether, they, were, based, on, land, or, on, person, or, both, in, addition, to, the, taxes, the, peasantry, must, have, had, other, obligations, such, as, building, and, maintaining, infrastructure, and, defences, as, well, as, providing, food, and, materiel, to, the, army, the, arab, writer, al, masudi, noted, that, instead, of, money, the, bulgarians, used, cows, and, sheep, to, buy, goods, the, density, of, the, network, of, towns, was, high, the, economic, historian, paul, bairoch, estimated, that, in, 800, pliska, had, 30, 000, inhabitants, and, by, c, 950, preslav, had, some, 60, 000, making, it, the, largest, city, in, non, muslim, europe, save, constantinople, in, comparison, the, largest, cities, in, contemporary, france, and, italy, did, not, reach, 30, 000, and, 50, 000, respectively, alongside, the, two, capitals, existed, other, prominent, urban, centres, making, bulgaria, the, most, urbanised, region, in, christian, europe, at, the, time, along, with, italy, according, to, contemporary, chronicles, there, were, 80, towns, in, the, region, of, the, lower, danube, alone, surviving, sources, list, more, than, 100, settlements, in, the, western, part, of, the, empire, where, the, bulgarian, orthodox, church, possessed, properties, the, larger, urban, centres, consisted, of, an, inner, and, an, outer, town, the, inner, town, would, be, encircled, with, stone, walls, and, had, administrative, and, defence, functions, while, the, outer, town, usually, unprotected, was, the, centre, of, economic, activities, with, markets, workshops, vineyards, gardens, and, dwellings, for, the, populace, however, as, elsewhere, in, the, early, middle, ages, the, country, remained, predominantly, rural, for, almost, two, centuries, after, its, creation, the, bulgarian, state, remained, pagan, the, bulgars, and, the, slavs, continued, to, practice, their, indigenous, religions, the, bulgar, religion, was, monotheistic, linked, to, the, cult, to, tangra, the, god, of, the, sky, the, worship, of, tangra, is, proven, by, an, inscription, that, reads, kanasubigi, omurtag, a, divine, ruler, performed, sacrifice, to, god, tangra, the, ruling, khan, had, an, important, place, in, the, religious, life, he, was, the, high, priest, and, performed, rituals, a, large, sanctuary, dedicated, to, the, cult, of, tangra, existed, near, the, modern, village, of, madara, the, bulgars, practised, shamanism, believed, in, magic, and, charms, and, performed, various, rituals, some, of, the, rituals, were, described, by, the, byzantines, after, the, most, christian, ruler, leo, v, had, to, pour, out, water, on, the, ground, from, a, cup, personally, turn, round, horse, saddles, touch, triple, bridle, lift, grass, high, above, the, ground, and, cut, up, dogs, as, witnesses, during, the, ceremony, of, the, signing, of, the, byzantine, bulgarian, treaty, of, 815, the, pouring, of, water, was, a, reminder, that, if, the, oath, is, broken, blood, would, pour, out, in, the, same, sense, can, be, explained, the, turning, of, the, saddle, a, warning, that, the, violator, would, not, be, able, to, ride, or, would, fall, dead, from, his, horse, during, battle, the, triple, bridle, symbolised, the, toughness, of, the, agreement, and, the, lifting, of, grass, reminded, that, no, grass, would, remain, in, the, enemy, country, if, the, peace, was, broken, the, sacrifice, of, dogs, was, a, common, custom, among, the, turkic, peoples, which, further, strengthened, the, treaty, the, slavs, worshiped, numerous, deities, the, supreme, god, was, perun, the, god, of, thunder, and, lightning, perun, was, the, only, god, mentioned, though, not, by, name, by, the, first, authoritative, reference, to, the, slavic, mythology, in, written, history, the, 6th, century, byzantine, historian, procopius, who, described, the, slavs, that, settled, south, of, the, danube, procopius, noted, that, they, also, worshipped, rivers, and, believed, in, nymphs, a, number, of, mythological, beings, from, the, slavic, pantheon, have, persisted, in, bulgarian, folklore, to, the, present, such, as, samodivas, halas, vilas, rusalkas, slavic, dragons, etc, during, sacrifices, the, slavs, performed, divinations, after, the, adoption, of, christianity, the, worship, of, perun, merged, with, the, cult, of, saint, elijah, christianity, was, practised, in, bulgaria, throughout, the, whole, pagan, period, its, dissemination, among, the, populace, increased, as, a, result, of, the, successful, wars, of, khan, krum, in, the, beginning, of, the, 9th, century, krum, employed, many, byzantine, christians, greeks, armenians, and, slavs, in, his, military, and, administration, some, of, them, served, as, deputies, of, the, kavhan, and, the, ichirgu, boila, tens, of, thousands, byzantines, were, resettled, across, bulgaria, mainly, beyond, the, danube, river, to, protect, the, north, eastern, borders, so, that, they, could, face, non, byzantines, many, of, them, however, maintained, clandestine, links, with, the, byzantine, court, which, fuelled, the, traditional, distrust, of, the, bulgarian, elite, and, resulted, in, a, large, scale, persecution, of, christianity, under, the, khans, omurtag, and, malamir, omurtag, and, the, nobility, saw, the, christians, as, byzantine, agents, and, felt, that, this, religion, with, its, hierarchy, based, in, byzantium, was, a, threat, to, bulgarian, independence, there, were, some, executions, including, two, of, the, five, strategoi, who, served, under, krum, leo, and, john, the, metropolitan, of, adrianople, the, bishop, of, debeltos, etc, the, list, of, the, martyred, christians, included, bulgar, asfer, kuberg, and, slav, names, the, dismissive, attitude, of, the, christians, towards, the, pagans, was, insulting, to, the, bulgarian, elite, in, a, conversation, with, a, byzantine, christian, omurtag, told, him, do, not, humiliate, our, gods, for, their, power, is, great, as, a, proof, we, who, worship, them, have, conquered, the, whole, roman, state, yet, despite, all, measures, christianity, continued, to, spread, reaching, the, members, of, the, khan, s, own, family, omurtag, s, eldest, son, enravota, seen, as, pro, christian, was, disinherited, and, eventually, converted, to, christianity, after, refusing, to, renounce, his, faith, he, was, executed, by, orders, of, his, brother, malamir, c, 833, and, became, the, first, bulgarian, saint, the, attitude, of, the, bulgarian, rulers, to, christianity, is, seen, in, the, philippi, inscription, of, khan, presian, if, someone, seeks, the, truth, god, watches, and, if, one, lies, god, watches, the, bulgarians, did, many, good, things, to, the, christians, and, the, christians, forgot, but, god, watches, by, 863, presian, s, successor, khan, boris, i, had, decided, to, accept, christianity, the, sources, do, not, mention, the, reasons, behind, this, decision, but, there, were, several, political, rationales, that, he, had, considered, as, christianity, was, spreading, further, into, europe, in, the, 9th, century, the, pagan, countries, found, themselves, encircled, by, christian, powers, which, could, use, religion, as, an, acceptable, excuse, for, aggression, conversion, on, the, other, hand, would, establish, the, country, as, an, equal, international, partner, there, is, evidence, that, bulgaria, had, contacts, with, the, muslim, world, as, well, either, directly, or, through, volga, bulgaria, which, had, adopted, islam, at, about, the, same, time, but, bulgaria, was, too, far, away, from, any, muslim, country, that, could, be, of, political, benefit, and, a, large, part, of, the, population, had, already, converted, to, christianity, furthermore, the, christian, doctrine, would, cement, the, monarch, s, position, high, above, the, nobility, as, an, autocrat, being, ruler, by, the, grace, of, god, and, god, s, representative, on, earth, moreover, christianity, presented, excellent, opportunity, to, firmly, consolidate, both, bulgars, and, slavs, as, a, single, bulgarian, people, under, a, common, religion, in, 863, boris, i, sought, a, mission, from, east, francia, rather, than, from, the, byzantine, empire, he, had, an, alliance, with, the, eastern, franks, since, 860, and, was, aware, that, the, larger, distance, between, the, two, countries, was, an, obstacle, for, them, to, yield, direct, influence, on, the, future, bulgarian, church, he, was, fully, aware, that, as, a, neighbour, byzantium, would, try, to, interfere, with, bulgarian, matters, indeed, the, byzantine, empire, was, determined, to, place, the, bulgarian, church, under, the, jurisdiction, of, the, ecumenical, patriarchate, of, constantinople, because, it, hoped, it, could, serve, as, leverage, to, influence, bulgarian, policies, and, to, prevent, bulgaria, from, becoming, a, military, tool, of, the, papacy, to, enforce, the, pope, s, wishes, on, the, empire, upon, learning, about, boris, i, s, intentions, the, byzantine, emperor, michael, iii, invaded, bulgaria, at, the, time, the, bulgarian, army, was, engaged, in, warfare, against, great, moravia, to, the, north, east, and, boris, i, agreed, to, negotiate, the, byzantines, only, demand, was, that, boris, i, adopt, orthodox, christianity, and, to, accept, byzantine, clergy, to, evangelise, the, population, boris, i, conceded, and, was, baptised, in, 864, taking, the, name, of, his, godfather, emperor, michael, the, highest, posts, in, the, newly, established, bulgarian, church, were, held, by, byzantines, who, preached, in, greek, aware, of, the, dangers, that, the, spiritual, dependency, on, the, byzantine, empire, could, pose, for, bulgaria, s, independence, boris, i, was, determined, to, ensure, the, autonomy, of, the, bulgarian, church, under, a, patriarch, since, the, byzantines, were, reluctant, to, grant, any, concessions, boris, i, took, advantage, on, the, ongoing, rivalry, between, the, patriarchate, of, constantinople, and, the, papacy, in, rome, in, order, to, prevent, either, of, them, from, exerting, religious, influence, on, his, lands, in, 866, he, sent, a, delegation, to, rome, under, the, high, ranking, official, peter, declaring, his, desire, to, accept, christianity, in, accordance, with, the, western, rites, along, with, 115, questions, to, pope, nicholas, i, the, pope, s, detailed, answers, to, boris, i, s, questions, were, delivered, by, two, bishops, heading, a, mission, to, facilitate, the, conversion, of, the, bulgarian, people, however, neither, nicolas, i, nor, his, successor, adrian, ii, agreed, to, recognize, an, autonomous, bulgarian, church, which, cooled, the, relations, between, the, two, sides, bulgaria, s, shift, towards, rome, on, the, other, hand, made, the, byzantines, much, more, conciliatory, in, 870, at, the, fourth, council, of, constantinople, the, bulgarian, church, was, recognized, as, an, autocephalous, eastern, orthodox, church, under, the, supreme, direction, of, the, patriarch, of, constantinople, the, adoption, of, christianity, was, met, with, opposition, by, large, numbers, of, the, nobility, in, 866, boris, i, faced, a, major, rebellion, of, the, boila, from, all, parts, of, the, country, the, insurgency, was, crushed, and, 52, leading, boilas, were, executed, along, with, their, whole, kin, after, boris, i, abdicated, in, 889, his, successor, and, eldest, son, vladimir, r, 889, 893, attempted, to, restore, paganism, but, his, father, took, arms, against, him, and, had, him, deposed, and, blinded, around, 870, the, bulgarian, church, became, an, autonomous, archbishopric, the, decree, of, autonomy, under, the, nominal, ecclesiastical, jurisdiction, of, constantinople, was, far, greater, than, could, possibly, have, been, achieved, under, the, papacy, following, the, fourth, council, of, constantinople, the, byzantine, clergy, was, re, admitted, to, bulgaria, and, allowed, to, preach, in, greek, however, as, a, result, of, the, council, of, preslav, in, 893, old, bulgarian, was, declared, the, official, language, of, the, state, and, the, church, and, the, greek, speaking, byzantine, priests, once, again, had, to, leave, the, country, thus, from, that, point, the, church, was, entirely, staffed, by, bulgarians, boris, i, s, successor, simeon, i, was, not, content, to, leave, the, bulgarian, church, as, an, archbishopric, and, was, determined, to, raise, it, to, a, patriarchate, in, light, of, his, own, ambition, to, become, an, emperor, he, was, well, acquainted, with, the, byzantine, imperial, tradition, that, the, autocrat, must, have, a, patriarch, and, there, could, be, no, empire, without, one, in, the, aftermath, of, his, remarkable, triumph, over, the, byzantines, in, the, battle, of, achelous, in, 918, he, convened, a, council, and, elevated, archbishop, leontius, to, patriarch, the, decisions, of, that, council, were, not, recognized, by, the, byzantines, but, as, a, result, of, the, bulgarian, victory, in, the, war, they, eventually, recognized, leontius, successor, demetrius, as, patriarch, of, bulgaria, in, 927, it, was, the, first, patriarchate, officially, accepted, apart, from, the, ancient, pentarchy, it, is, likely, that, the, seat, of, the, patriarchate, was, in, the, city, of, drastar, on, the, danube, river, rather, than, in, the, capital, preslav, in, the, late, 10th, century, the, bulgarian, patriarchate, included, the, following, dioceses, ohrid, kostur, glavinitsa, in, modern, southern, albania, maglen, pelagonia, strumitsa, morovizd, in, modern, northern, greece, velbazhd, serdica, brani, evo, ni, belgrade, srem, skopje, prizren, lipljan, servia, drastar, voden, ras, chernik, himara, drinopol, butrint, yanina, petra, and, stag, after, the, fall, of, the, eastern, parts, of, the, empire, under, byzantine, occupation, in, 971, the, seat, of, the, patriarchate, was, relocated, to, ohrid, in, the, west, with, the, final, conquest, of, bulgaria, in, 1018, the, patriarchate, was, demoted, to, an, archbishopric, but, retained, many, privileges, it, kept, control, of, all, existing, episcopal, sees, the, seat, remained, in, ohrid, and, its, titular, the, bulgarian, john, of, debar, kept, his, office, furthermore, the, bulgarian, archbishopric, was, given, a, special, position, it, was, placed, directly, under, the, emperor, rather, than, under, the, ecumenical, patriarch, of, constantinople, monasticism, grew, steadily, and, the, monasteries, quickly, became, major, landowners, with, a, large, population, of, peasants, living, on, their, estates, it, developed, further, under, the, reign, of, emperor, peter, i, accompanied, by, the, augmentation, of, their,

virtues, soon, attracted, a, number, of, followers, who, founded, the, renowned, rila, monastery, after, his, death, he, preached, about, living, in, harmony, and, stressed, the, value, of, manual,

centre, from, where, the, small, number, of, ruthenian, christians, obtained, clergy, and, liturgical, texts, as, a, result, of, the, sviatoslav, s, invasion, of, bulgaria, many, of, his, soldiers, were, influenced, by, christianity, and, maintained, that, interest, after, their, return, the, connections, between, bulgarians, and, ruthenians, must, be, considered, an, important, background, to, the, official, conversion, to, christianity, of, kievan, rus, in, 988, during, the, reign, of, emperor, peter, i, r, 927, 969, a, heretical, movement, known, as, bogomilism, arose, in, bulgaria, the, heresy, was, named, after, its, founder, the, priest, bogomil, whose, name, can, be, translated, as, dear, mil, to, god, bog, the, main, sources, about, bogomilism, in, bulgaria, come, from, a, letter, of, the, ecumenical, patriarch, theophylact, of, constantinople, to, peter, i, c, 940, a, treatise, by, cosmas, the, priest, c, 970, and, the, anti, bogomil, council, of, emperor, boril, of, bulgaria, 1211, bogomilism, was, a, neo, gnostic, and, dualist, sect, that, believed, that, god, had, two, sons, jesus, christ, and, satan, that, represented, the, two, principles, good, and, evil, god, had, created, light, and, the, invisible, world, while, satan, rebelled, and, created, darkness, the, material, world, and, man, therefore, they, rejected, marriage, reproduction, the, church, the, old, testament, the, cross, etc, the, bogomils, were, divided, into, several, categories, led, by, the, perfecti, the, perfect, ones, that, never, married, consumed, no, meat, and, wine, and, preached, the, gospel, women, too, could, become, perfecti, the, other, two, categories, were, the, believers, who, had, to, adopt, and, follow, most, of, the, bogomil, moral, ethics, and, the, listeners, who, were, not, required, to, change, their, lifestyle, the, bogomils, were, described, by, cosmas, as, looking, docile, modest, and, silent, from, the, outside, but, being, hypocrites, and, ravenous, wolves, in, the, inside, the, bulgarian, orthodox, church, condemned, the, teachings, of, bogomilism, members, of, the, sect, were, persecuted, by, the, state, authorities, as, well, the, bogomils, preached, civil, disobedience, because, they, considered, the, state, as, with, anything, earthly, to, be, linked, with, satan, the, sect, could, not, be, eradicated, and, from, bulgaria, it, eventually, spread, to, the, rest, of, the, balkans, the, byzantine, empire, southern, france, and, northern, italy, in, certain, regions, of, western, europe, the, heresy, flourished, under, different, names, cathars, albigensians, patarins, until, the, 14th, century, the, bulgarian, state, existed, before, the, formation, of, the, bulgarian, people, prior, to, the, establishment, of, the, bulgarian, state, the, slavs, had, mingled, with, the, native, thracian, population, the, population, and, the, density, of, the, settlements, increased, after, 681, and, the, differences, among, the, individual, slavic, tribes, gradually, disappeared, as, communications, became, regular, among, the, regions, of, the, country, by, the, second, half, of, the, 9th, century, bulgars, and, slavs, and, romanized, or, hellenized, thracians, had, lived, together, for, almost, two, centuries, and, the, numerous, slavs, were, well, on, the, way, to, assimilating, the, thracians, and, the, bulgars, many, bulgars, had, already, started, to, use, the, slavic, old, bulgarian, language, while, the, bulgar, language, of, the, ruling, caste, gradually, died, out, leaving, only, certain, words, and, phrases, the, christianization, of, bulgaria, the, establishment, of, old, bulgarian, as, a, language, of, the, state, and, the, church, under, boris, i, and, the, creation, of, the, cyrillic, script, in, the, country, were, the, main, means, to, the, final, formation, of, the, bulgarian, nation, in, the, 9th, century, this, included, macedonia, where, the, bulgarian, khan, kuber, established, a, state, existing, in, parallel, with, khan, asparuh, s, bulgarian, empire, the, new, religion, dealt, a, crushing, blow, to, the, privileges, of, the, old, bulgar, aristocracy, also, by, that, time, many, bulgars, were, presumably, speaking, slavic, boris, i, made, it, a, national, policy, to, use, the, doctrine, of, christianity, that, had, neither, slavic, nor, bulgar, origin, to, bind, them, together, in, a, single, culture, as, a, result, by, the, end, of, the, 9th, century, the, bulgarians, had, become, a, single, slavic, nationality, with, ethnic, awareness, that, was, to, survive, in, triumph, and, tragedy, to, present, the, cultural, heritage, of, the, first, bulgarian, empire, is, usually, defined, in, bulgarian, historiography, as, the, pliska, preslav, culture, named, after, the, first, two, capitals, pliska, and, preslav, where, most, of, the, surviving, monuments, are, concentrated, many, monuments, of, that, period, have, been, found, around, madara,

symbolism, of, the, depiction, is, uncertain, as, well, its, actual, masonry, tradition, and, cultural, source, the, origin, of, the, relief, is, connected, with, the, bulgar, ethnogenesis, the, semi, nomadic, equestrian, warrior, culture, from, the, eurasian, steppe, the, madara, rider, bears, resemblance, to, the, persian, sasanian, rock, relief, tradition, the, hero, horseman, is, also, a, common, character, of, turko, altaic, and, alanic, mythology, it, is, sometimes, believed, that, the, horseman, represents, or, is, related, to, the, bulgar, deity, tangra, while, russian,

9th, century, two, story, ovens, were, used, for, the, annealing, of, the, pottery, the, shape, and, decoration, of, early, bulgarian, pottery, was, similar, to, that, found, in, northern, caucasus, the, crimea, and, the, shores, of, the, sea, of, azov, the, growing, exchange, with, the, byzantine, empire, following, the, adoption, of, christianity, led, to, an, increase, in, the, shapes, and, decorations, of, bulgarian, pottery, that, was, unprecedented, in, the, slavic, world, one, of, the, most, famous, features, of, the, pliska, preslav, culture, was, the, decoration, of, palaces, and, churches, with, lacquered, ceramic, plates, which, may, indicate, a, near, eastern, arabic, influence, they, were, produced, of, white, clay, known, also, as, kaolin, in, the, 10th, century, the,

also, exported, abroad, many, of, them, were, marked, with, cyrillic, or, glagolitic, letters, on, the, rear, side, archaeologists, have, discovered, tile, of, that, style, in, kiev, showing, bulgarian, influences, in, kievan, rus, the, ceramic, plates, were, painted, mostly, to, include, geometric, or, vegetative, elements, and, sometimes, birds, some, had, depictions, of, the, virgin, saints, and, apostles, both, in, full, figures, portraits, and, medallions, due, to, the, destruction, of, pliska, and, preslav, only, fragments, and, details, of, the, ceramic, decoration, have, survived, among, the, most, notable, of, those, is, the, well, preserved, 20, tile, icon, of, st, theodore, found, in, the, ruins, of, the, patleina, monastery, of, saint, panteleimon, in, the, outskirts, of, preslav, which, was, the, site, of, one, of, the, workshops, the, extensive, use, of, ceramic, decoration, in, preslav, and, the, nearby, churches, and, monasteries, most, probably, pre, dates, its, widespread, use, in, constantinople, although, boris, i, had, succeeded, in, securing, an, autonomous, church, the, higher, clergy, and, theological, books, were, still, in, greek, which, impeded, his, efforts, to, convert, the, populace, to, the, new, religion, between, 860, and, 863, the, byzantine, monks, saints, cyril, and, methodius, created, the, glagolitic, alphabet, the, first, slavic, alphabet, by, order, of, the, byzantine, emperor, who, aimed, to, convert, great, moravia, to, orthodox, christianity, the, language, they, used, was, called, by, later, historians, old, church, slavonic, and, was, based, on, the, local, slavic, dialect, spoken, in, the, region, of, thessaloniki, and, hence, it, is, also, known, as, old, bulgarian, ultimately, the, brothers, mission, to, establish, slavic, liturgy, in, great, moravia, failed, in, 886, their, disciples, clement, naum, and, angelarius, who, had, been, banished, from, great, moravia, reached, bulgaria, and, received, a, warm, welcome, from, boris, i, they, began, to, preach, in, bulgaria, and, thus, the, work, of, the, slavic, mission, of, cyril, and, methodius, was, saved, the, bulgarian, monarch, commissioned, the, creation, of, two, theological, academies, to, be, headed, by, the, disciples, where, they, were, to, instruct, the, future, bulgarian, clergy, in, bulgarian, vernacular, clement, was, sent, to, the, southwestern, province, of, kutmichevitsa, in, macedonia, where, he, founded, the, ohrid, literary, school, there, he, educated, 3, 500, pupils, between, 886, and, 907, naum, established, the, literary, school, in, the, capital, pliska, which, moved, later, to, the, new, capital, preslav, eventually, naum, too, was, sent, to, ohrid, the, rationale, to, centre, the, literary, activities, far, away, from, the, capital, was, that, at, the, time, a, byzantine, archbishop, still, resided, in, pliska, in, the, late, 9th, or, the, early, 10th, century, the, cyrillic, script, was, created, at, the, preslav, literary, school, it, was, based, on, the, greek, alphabet, and, included, 14, original, letters, for, sounds, that, were, non, existent, in, greek, making, an, alphabet, of, 38, letters, in, the, next, few, decades, the, new, script, replaced, the, glagolitic, alphabet, in, bulgaria, and, eventually, spread, to, the, whole, eastern, orthodox, slavic, world, today, more, than, 250, million, people, in, eurasia, use, it, as, the, official, alphabet, for, their, national, languages, the, development, of, old, church, slavonic, literacy, had, the, effect, of, preventing, the, assimilation, of, the, south, slavs, into, neighbouring, cultures, while, stimulating, the, formation, of, the, distinct, bulgarian, identity, initially, translation, from, byzantine, greek, of, texts, on, theology, history, and, geography, was, a, priority, literary, activities, flourished, during, the, reign, of, simeon, i, who, had, a, personal, interest, in, literature, he, gathered, many, scholars, in, the, court, who, translated, an, enormous, number, of, books, from, greek, and, wrote, many, new, works, among, the, most, prominent, figures, were, constantine, of, preslav, john, the, exarch, and, chernorizets, hrabar, who, is, believed, by, some, historians, to, have, been, simeon, i, himself, they, wrote, hagiographies, panegyrics, acolouthia, poetry, liturgical, hymns, treatises, on, church, music, etc, one, of, the, first, original, works, was, on, the, letters, by, chernorizets, hrabar, where, he, defended, the, cyrillic, alphabet, against, its, byzantine, greek, critics, and, proved, not, only, its, right, to, existence, but, also, its, superiority, to, the, greek, alphabet, arguing, that, the, greek, letters, were, neither, the, oldest, known, to, man, nor, divine, in, the, form, of, rhetorical, questions, and, answers, on, the, letters, demonstrated, the, excellent, historic, and, linguistic, knowledge, of, its, author, as, he, indicated, that, god, did, not, first, create, the, hebrew, or, the, greek, language, but, syrian, which, adam, spoke, and, underlined, that, before, then, the, greeks, had, no, alphabet, of, their, own, but, wrote, their, speech, with, phoenician, letters, constantine, of, preslav, and, john, the, exarch, combined, translated, and, adapted, byzantine, works, with, original, texts, the, latter, compiled, the, shestodnev, hexameron, that, included, valuable, first, hand, evidence, about, the, bulgarian, empire, under, simeon, i, constantine, of, preslav, s, didactic, gospel, was, the, first, systematic, work, on, sermons, in, slavic, literature, it, also, featured, the, poetic, preface, azbuchna, molitva, alphabet, prayer, the, first, original, poetry, in, the, bulgarian, language, later, cosmas, the, priest, wrote, the, anti, bogomil, treatise, sermon, against, the, heretics, which, apart, from, the, theological, arguments, criticized, contemporary, bulgarian, society, particularly, on, religious, and, social, issues, apart, from, the, official, literature, apocryphal, texts, were, also, written, and, gained, popularity, after, the, second, half, of, the, 10th, century, as, imperial, patronage, ceased, during, the, byzantine, conquest, and, subsequent, byzantine, rule, in, bulgaria, one, such, work, expressing, the, bulgarian, aspirations, and, fears, was, tale, of, the, cross, tree, by, jeremiah, the, priest, that, was, banned, by, the, orthodox, church, as, heresy, the, flourishing, literary, activity, and, the, experimentation, with, various, genres, developed, the, style, flexibility, and, expressiveness, of, the, language, the, literature, produced, in, the, old, bulgarian, language, soon, spread, north, and, became, the, lingua, franca, of, the, balkans, and, eastern, europe, bulgarian, scholars, and, works, influenced, most, of, the, slavic, world, including, kievan, rus, medieval, serbia, and, medieval, croatia, as, well, as, the, non, slavic, medieval, wallachia, and, moldavia, this, thriving, activity, came, to, an, abrupt, end, with, the, byzantine, conquest, of, bulgaria, in, the, following, 150, years, the, byzantines, systematically, destroyed, all, texts, in, old, bulgarian, language, none, of, the, works, of, the, first, empire, have, survived, in, original, within, its, territory, and, those, that, have,
