the, lewis, and, clark, expedition, also, known, as, the, corps, of, discovery, expedition, was, the, united, states, expedition, to, cross, the, newly, acquired, western, portion, of, the, country, after, the, louisiana, purchase, the, corps, of, discovery, was, a, select, group, of, u, s, army, and, civilian, volunteers, under, the, command, of, captain, meriwether, lewis, and, his, close, friend, second, lieutenant, william, clark, clark, along, with, 30, others, set, out, from, camp, dubois, camp, wood, illinois, on, may, 14, 1804, met, lewis, and, ten, other, members, of, the, group, in, st, charles, missouri, then, went, up, the, missouri, river, the, expedition, crossed, the, continental, divide, of, the, americas, near, the, lemhi, pass, eventually, coming, to, the, columbia, river, and, the, pacific, ocean, in, 1805, the, return, voyage, began, on, march, 23, 1806, at, fort, clatsop, oregon, ending, six, months, later, on, september, 23, of, that, year, president, thomas, jefferson, commissioned, the, expedition, shortly, after, the, louisiana, purchase, of, 1803, to, explore, and, detail, as, much, of, the, new, territory, as, possible, furthermore, he, wished, to, find, a, practical, travel, route, across, the, western, half, of, the, continent, directly, avoiding, the, hot, and, desolate, desert, southwest, and, to, establish, an, american, presence, in, the, new, lands, before, european, powers, attempted, to, establish, claims, of, their, own, the, campaign, s, secondary, objectives, were, scientific, economical, and, humanitarian, i, e, to, document, the, west, s, biodiversity, topography, and, geography, and, to, establish, positive, trade, relations, with, potentially, unknown, native, american, tribes, the, expedition, returned, to, st, louis, to, report, their, findings, to, president, jefferson, via, maps, sketches, and, various, journals, one, of, thomas, jefferson, s, goals, was, to, find, the, most, direct, and, practicable, water, communication, across, this, continent, for, the, purposes, of, commerce, he, also, placed, special, importance, on, declaring, us, sovereignty, over, the, land, occupied, by, the, many, different, native, american, tribes, along, the, missouri, river, and, getting, an, accurate, sense, of, the, resources, in, the, recently, completed, louisiana, purchase, the, expedition, made, notable, contributions, to, science, but, scientific, research, was, not, the, main, goal, of, the, mission, for, years, thomas, jefferson, read, accounts, about, the, adventures, of, various, explorers, on, the, western, frontier, and, consequently, maintained, a, long, held, interest, in, further, exploring, this, mostly, unknown, region, of, the, continent, in, the, 1780s, while, minister, to, france, jefferson, met, john, ledyard, in, paris, where, they, discussed, a, possible, trip, to, the, pacific, northwest, jefferson, had, also, read, captain, james, cook, s, a, voyage, to, the, pacific, ocean, london, 1784, an, account, of, cook, s, third, voyage, and, le, page, du, pratz, s, the, history, of, louisiana, london, 1763, all, of, which, greatly, influenced, his, decision, to, send, an, expedition, like, captain, cook, he, wished, to, discover, a, practical, route, through, the, northwest, to, the, pacific, coast, alexander, mackenzie, had, already, charted, a, route, in, his, quest, for, the, pacific, following, canada, s, mackenzie, river, to, the, arctic, ocean, in, 1789, mackenzie, and, his, party, were, the, first, non, indigenous, people, to, cross, mainland, north, america, north, of, mexico, reaching, the, pacific, coast, of, british, columbia, in, 1793, twelve, years, earlier, than, lewis, and, clark, mackenzie, s, accounts, in, voyages, from, montreal, 1801, informed, jefferson, of, britain, s, intent, to, establish, control, over, the, lucrative, fur, trade, of, the, columbia, river, convincing, him, of, the, importance, of, securing, the, territory, posthaste, in, philadelphia, israel, whelen, purveyor, of, public, supplies, purchased, necessities, for, the, expedition, with, a, list, provided, by, lewis, among, the, items, found, were, 193, pounds, of, portable, soup, 130, rolls, of, pigtail, tobacco, 30, gallons, of, strong, spirit, of, wine, a, wide, assortment, of, native, american, presents, medical, and, surgical, supplies, mosquito, netting, and, oilskin, bags, two, years, into, his, presidency, jefferson, asked, congress, to, fund, an, expedition, through, the, louisiana, territory, to, the, pacific, ocean, he, did, not, attempt, to, make, a, secret, of, the, lewis, and, clark, expedition, from, spanish, french, and, british, officials, but, rather, claimed, different, reasons, for, the, venture, he, used, a, secret, message, to, ask, for, funding, due, to, poor, relations, with, the, opposition, federalist, party, in, congress, congress, subsequently, appropriated, 2, 324, for, supplies, and, food, the, appropriation, of, which, was, left, in, lewis, s, charge, in, 1803, jefferson, commissioned, the, corps, of, discovery, and, named, army, captain, meriwether, lewis, its, leader, who, then, invited, william, clark, to, co, lead, the, expedition, with, him, lewis, demonstrated, remarkable, skills, and, potential, as, a, frontiersman, and, jefferson, made, efforts, to, prepare, him, for, the, long, journey, ahead, as, the, expedition, was, gaining, approval, and, funding, jefferson, explained, his, choice, of, lewis, it, was, impossible, to, find, a, character, who, to, a, complete, science, in, botany, natural, history, mineralogy, astronomy, joined, the, firmness, of, constitution, character, prudence, habits, adapted, to, the, woods, a, familiarity, with, the, indian, manners, and, character, requisite, for, this, undertaking, all, the, latter, qualifications, capt, lewis, has, in, 1803, jefferson, sent, lewis, to, philadelphia, to, study, medicinal, cures, under, benjamin, rush, a, physician, and, former, leader, in, the, american, revolution, he, also, arranged, for, lewis, to, be, further, educated, by, andrew, ellicott, an, astronomer, who, instructed, him, in, the, use, of, a, sextant, among, other, navigational, instruments, from, benjamin, smith, barton, lewis, learned, how, to, describe, and, preserve, plant, and, animal, specimens, from, robert, patterson, refinements, in, computing, latitude, and, longitude, and, caspar, wistar, covered, fossils, and, the, search, for, possible, living, remnants, lewis, however, was, not, ignorant, of, science, having, demonstrated, a, marked, capacity, to, learn, especially, with, jefferson, as, his, teacher, at, monticello, jefferson, possessed, an, enormous, library, on, the, subject, of, north, american, geography, to, which, lewis, had, full, access, he, spent, time, consulting, maps, and, books, as, well, as, conferring, with, jefferson, the, keelboat, used, for, the, first, year, of, the, journey, was, built, near, pittsburgh, pennsylvania, in, the, summer, of, 1803, to, lewis, s, specifications, and, was, completed, on, august, 31, the, vessel, was, immediately, loaded, with, equipment, and, provisions, while, in, pittsburgh, lewis, bought, a, newfoundland, dog, seaman, to, accompany, them, newfoundlands, are, amicable, large, working, dogs, and, good, swimmers, lovers, of, water, and, commonly, found, on, fishing, boats, as, they, can, assist, in, water, rescues, seaman, proved, a, valuable, member, of, the, party, aiding, with, hunting, and, protection, from, bears, and, other, potential, predators, he, was, the, only, animal, to, complete, the, entire, trip, lewis, and, his, crew, set, sail, that, afternoon, traveling, down, the, ohio, river, to, meet, up, with, clark, near, louisville, kentucky, in, october, 1803, at, the, falls, of, the, ohio, their, goals, were, to, explore, the, vast, territory, acquired, by, the, louisiana, purchase, and, to, establish, trade, and, us, sovereignty, over, the, native, americans, along, the, missouri, river, jefferson, also, wanted, to, establish, a, us, claim, of, discovery, to, the, pacific, northwest, and, oregon, territory, by, documenting, an, american, presence, there, before, european, nations, could, claim, the, land, according, to, some, historians, jefferson, understood, that, he, would, have, a, better, claim, of, ownership, to, the, pacific, northwest, if, the, team, gathered, scientific, data, on, animals, and, plants, however, his, main, objectives, were, centered, around, finding, an, all, water, route, to, the, pacific, coast, and, commerce, his, instructions, to, the, expedition, stated, the, object, of, your, mission, is, to, explore, the, missouri, river, such, principle, stream, of, it, as, by, its, course, and, communication, with, the, waters, of, the, pacific, ocean, whether, the, columbia, oregon, colorado, or, any, other, river, may, offer, the, most, direct, practicable, water, communication, across, this, continent, for, the, purpose, of, commerce, the, us, mint, prepared, special, silver, medals, with, a, portrait, of, jefferson, and, inscribed, with, a, message, of, friendship, and, peace, called, indian, peace, medals, the, soldiers, were, to, distribute, them, to, the, tribes, that, they, met, the, expedition, also, prepared, advanced, weapons, to, display, their, military, firepower, among, these, was, an, austrian, made, 46, caliber, girandoni, air, rifle, a, repeating, rifle, with, a, 20, round, tubular, magazine, that, was, powerful, enough, to, kill, a, deer, the, expedition, was, prepared, with, flintlock, firearms, knives, blacksmithing, supplies, and, cartography, equipment, they, also, carried, flags, gift, bundles, medicine, and, other, items, that, they, would, need, for, their, journey, the, route, of, lewis, and, clark, s, expedition, took, them, up, the, missouri, river, to, its, headwaters, then, on, to, the, pacific, ocean, via, the, columbia, river, and, it, may, have, been, influenced, by, the, purported, transcontinental, journey, of, moncacht, ap, by, the, same, route, about, a, century, before, jefferson, had, a, copy, of, le, page, s, book, in, his, library, detailing, moncacht, ap, s, itinerary, and, lewis, carried, a, copy, with, him, during, the, expedition, le, page, s, description, of, moncacht, ap, s, route, across, the, continent, neglects, to, mention, the, need, to, cross, the, rocky, mountains, and, it, might, be, the, source, of, lewis, and, clark, s, mistaken, belief, that, they, could, easily, carry, boats, from, the, missouri, s, headwaters, to, the, westward, flowing, columbia, the, corps, of, discovery, departed, from, camp, dubois, camp, wood, at, 4, pm, on, may, 14, 1804, under, clark, s, command, they, traveled, up, the, missouri, river, in, their, keelboat, and, two, pirogues, to, st, charles, missouri, where, lewis, joined, them, six, days, later, the, expedition, set, out, the, next, afternoon, may, 21, while, accounts, vary, it, is, believed, the, corps, had, as, many, as, 45, members, including, the, officers, enlisted, military, personnel, civilian, volunteers, and, york, an, african, american, man, enslaved, by, clark, from, st, charles, the, expedition, followed, the, missouri, through, what, is, now, kansas, city, missouri, and, omaha, nebraska, on, august, 20, 1804, sergeant, charles, floyd, died, apparently, from, acute, appendicitis, he, had, been, among, the, first, to, sign, up, with, the, corps, of, discovery, and, was, the, only, member, to, die, during, the, expedition, he, was, buried, at, a, bluff, by, the, river, now, named, after, him, in, what, is, now, sioux, city, iowa, his, burial, site, was, marked, with, a, cedar, post, on, which, was, inscribed, his, name, and, day, of, death, 1, mile, 2, km, up, the, river, the, expedition, camped, at, a, small, river, which, they, named, floyd, s, river, during, the, final, week, of, august, lewis, and, clark, reached, the, edge, of, the, great, plains, a, place, abounding, with, elk, deer, bison, pronghorn, and, beavers, the, lewis, and, clark, expedition, established, relations, with, two, dozen, native, american, nations, without, whose, help, the, group, would, have, risked, starvation, during, the, harsh, winters, and, or, become, hopelessly, lost, in, the, vast, ranges, of, the, rocky, mountains, the, americans, and, the, lakota, nation, whom, the, americans, called, sioux, or, teton, wan, sioux, had, problems, when, they, met, and, there, was, a, concern, the, two, sides, might, clash, according, to, harry, w, fritz, all, earlier, missouri, river, travelers, had, warned, of, this, powerful, and, aggressive, tribe, determined, to, block, free, trade, on, the, river, the, sioux, were, also, expecting, a, retaliatory, raid, from, the, omaha, tribe, to, the, south, a, recent, sioux, raid, had, killed, 75, omaha, men, burned, 40, lodges, and, taken, four, dozen, prisoners, the, expedition, held, talks, with, the, lakota, near, the, confluence, of, the, missouri, and, bad, rivers, in, what, is, now, fort, pierre, south, dakota, one, of, their, horses, disappeared, and, they, believed, the, sioux, were, responsible, afterward, the, two, sides, met, and, there, was, a, disagreement, and, the, sioux, asked, the, men, to, stay, or, to, give, more, gifts, or, tribute, instead, before, being, allowed, to, pass, through, their, territory, clark, wrote, they, were, warlike, and, were, the, vilest, miscreants, of, the, savage, race, they, came, close, to, blows, several, times, until, the, lakota, chief, black, buffalo, persuaded, lewis, to, distribute, more, tobacco, to, the, assembled, warriors, lewis, complied, and, the, expedition, was, allowed, to, continue, upstream, to, the, arikara, villages, in, the, winter, of, 1804, 05, the, party, built, fort, mandan, near, present, day, washburn, north, dakota, just, before, departing, on, april, 7, 1805, the, expedition, sent, the, keelboat, back, to, st, louis, with, a, sample, of, specimens, some, never, before, seen, east, of, the, mississippi, one, chief, asked, lewis, and, clark, to, provide, a, boat, for, passage, through, their, national, territory, the, americans, quickly, continued, westward, upriver, and, camped, for, the, winter, in, the, mandan, nation, s, territory, after, the, expedition, had, set, up, camp, nearby, tribal, members, came, to, visit, in, fair, numbers, some, staying, all, night, for, several, days, lewis, and, clark, met, in, council, with, mandan, chiefs, here, they, met, a, french, canadian, fur, trapper, named, toussaint, charbonneau, and, his, young, shoshone, wife, sacagawea, charbonneau, at, this, time, began, to, serve, as, the, expedition, s, translator, peace, was, established, between, the, expedition, and, the, mandan, chiefs, with, the, sharing, of, a, mandan, ceremonial, pipe, by, april, 25, captain, lewis, wrote, his, progress, report, of, the, expedition, s, activities, and, observations, of, the, native, american, nations, they, had, encountered, to, date, in, a, statistical, view, of, the, indian, nations, inhabiting, the, territory, of, louisiana, which, outlined, the, names, of, various, tribes, their, locations, trading, practices, and, water, routes, used, among, other, points, president, jefferson, would, later, present, this, report, to, congress, they, followed, the, missouri, to, its, headwaters, and, over, the, continental, divide, at, lemhi, pass, then, north, to, traveler, s, rest, and, crossed, the, bitteroots, at, lolo, pass, they, descended, on, foot, then, proceeded, in, canoes, down, the, clearwater, snake, and, columbia, rivers, past, celilo, falls, and, present, day, portland, at, the, confluence, of, the, willamette, and, columbia, rivers, lewis, and, clark, used, william, robert, broughton, s, 1792, notes, and, maps, to, orient, themselves, once, they, reached, the, lower, columbia, river, the, sighting, of, mount, hood, and, other, stratovolcanos, confirmed, that, the, expedition, had, almost, reached, the, pacific, ocean, the, expedition, sighted, the, pacific, ocean, for, the, first, time, on, november, 7, 1805, arriving, two, weeks, later, the, expedition, faced, the, beginning, of, its, second, bitter, winter, camped, on, the, north, side, of, the, columbia, river, in, a, storm, wracked, area, clark, called, dismal, nitch, lack, of, food, was, a, major, factor, the, elk, the, party, s, main, source, of, food, had, retreated, from, their, usual, haunts, into, the, mountains, and, the, party, was, now, too, poor, to, purchase, enough, food, from, neighboring, tribes, on, november, 24, 1805, the, majority, of, the, party, voted, to, move, their, camp, to, the, south, side, of, the, columbia, river, near, modern, astoria, oregon, both, sacagawea, and, the, enslaved, york, participated, in, the, vote, on, the, south, side, of, the, columbia, river, 2, miles, 3, km, upstream, on, the, west, side, of, the, netul, river, now, lewis, and, clark, river, they, constructed, fort, clatsop, they, did, this, not, just, for, shelter, and, protection, but, also, to, officially, establish, the, american, presence, there, with, the, american, flag, flying, over, the, fort, during, the, winter, at, fort, clatsop, lewis, committed, himself, to, writing, he, filled, many, pages, of, his, journals, with, valuable, knowledge, mostly, about, botany, because, of, the, abundant, growth, and, forests, that, covered, that, part, of, the, continent, the, health, of, the, men, also, became, a, problem, with, many, suffering, from, colds, and, influenza, knowing, that, maritime, fur, traders, sometimes, visited, the, lower, columbia, river, lewis, and, clark, repeatedly, asked, the, local, chinooks, about, trading, ships, they, learned, that, captain, samuel, hill, had, been, there, in, early, 1805, miscommunication, caused, clark, to, record, the, name, as, haley, captain, hill, returned, in, november, 1805, and, anchored, about, 10, miles, 16, km, from, fort, clatsop, the, chinook, told, hill, about, lewis, and, clark, but, no, direct, contact, was, made, a, russian, maritime, expedition, under, statesman, nikolai, rezanov, arrived, at, the, mouth, of, the, columbia, river, while, lewis, and, clark, were, still, there, neither, rezanov, nor, lewis, and, clark, knew, about, each, other, rezanov, had, come, from, novo, arkhangelsk, today, sitka, alaska, intending, to, establish, a, russian, agricultural, colony, to, help, with, the, perennial, food, shortages, in, russian, america, and, made, plans, for, a, relocation, of, the, capital, of, russian, america, from, sitka, to, the, lower, columbia, river, but, his, ship, juno, was, unable, to, cross, the, columbia, bar, so, rezanov, went, to, california, instead, setting, in, motion, a, process, that, eventually, led, to, the, founding, of, fort, ross, california, lewis, was, determined, to, remain, at, the, fort, until, april, 1, but, was, still, anxious, to, move, out, at, the, earliest, opportunity, by, march, 22, the, stormy, weather, had, subsided, and, the, following, morning, on, march, 23, 1806, the, journey, home, began, the, corps, began, their, journey, homeward, using, canoes, to, ascend, the, columbia, river, and, later, by, trekking, over, land, before, leaving, clark, gave, the, chinook, a, letter, to, give, to, the, next, ship, captain, to, visit, which, was, the, same, captain, hill, who, had, been, nearby, during, the, winter, hill, took, the, letter, to, canton, and, had, it, forwarded, to, thomas, jefferson, who, thus, received, it, before, lewis, and, clark, returned, they, made, their, way, to, camp, chopunnish, in, idaho, along, the, north, bank, of, the, clearwater, river, where, the, members, of, the, expedition, collected, 65, horses, in, preparation, to, cross, the, bitterroot, mountains, lying, between, modern, day, idaho, and, western, montana, however, the, range, was, still, covered, in, snow, which, prevented, the, expedition, from, making, the, crossing, on, april, 11, while, the, corps, was, waiting, for, the, snow, to, diminish, lewis, s, dog, seaman, was, stolen, by, native, americans, but, was, retrieved, shortly, worried, that, other, such, acts, might, follow, lewis, warned, the, chief, that, any, other, wrongdoing, or, mischievous, acts, would, result, in, instant, death, on, july, 3, before, crossing, the, continental, divide, the, corps, split, into, two, teams, so, lewis, could, explore, the, marias, river, lewis, s, group, of, four, met, some, men, from, the, blackfeet, nation, during, the, night, the, blackfeet, tried, to, steal, their, weapons, in, the, struggle, the, soldiers, killed, two, blackfeet, men, lewis, george, drouillard, and, the, field, brothers, fled, over, 100, miles, 160, kilometres, in, a, day, before, they, camped, again, meanwhile, clark, had, entered, the, crow, tribe, s, territory, in, the, night, half, of, clark, s, horses, disappeared, but, not, a, single, crow, had, been, seen, lewis, and, clark, stayed, separated, until, they, reached, the, confluence, of, the, yellowstone, and, missouri, rivers, on, august, 11, as, the, groups, reunited, one, of, clark, s, hunters, pierre, cruzatte, mistook, lewis, for, an, elk, and, fired, injuring, lewis, in, the, thigh, once, together, the, corps, was, able, to, return, home, quickly, via, the, missouri, river, they, reached, st, louis, on, september, 23, 1806, in, march, 1804, before, the, expedition, began, in, may, the, spanish, in, new, mexico, learned, from, general, james, wilkinson, that, the, americans, were, encroaching, on, territory, claimed, by, spain, after, the, lewis, and, clark, expedition, set, off, in, may, the, spanish, sent, four, armed, expeditions, of, 52, soldiers, mercenaries, and, native, americans, on, august, 1, 1804, from, santa, fe, new, mexico, northward, under, pedro, vial, and, jos, jarvet, to, intercept, lewis, and, clark, and, imprison, the, entire, expedition, they, reached, the, pawnee, settlement, on, the, platte, river, in, central, nebraska, and, learned, that, the, expedition, had, been, there, many, days, before, the, expedition, was, covering, 70, to, 80, miles, 110, to, 130, km, a, day, and, vial, s, attempt, to, intercept, them, was, unsuccessful, the, lewis, and, clark, expedition, gained, an, understanding, of, the, geography, of, the, northwest, and, produced, the, first, accurate, maps, of, the, area, during, the, journey, lewis, and, clark, drew, about, 140, maps, stephen, ambrose, says, the, expedition, filled, in, the, main, outlines, of, the, area, the, expedition, documented, natural, resources, and, plants, that, had, been, previously, unknown, to, euro, americans, though, not, to, the, indigenous, peoples, lewis, and, clark, were, the, first, americans, to, cross, the, continental, divide, and, the, first, americans, to, see, yellowstone, enter, into, montana, and, produce, an, official, description, of, these, different, regions, their, visit, to, the, pacific, northwest, maps, and, proclamations, of, sovereignty, with, medals, and, flags, were, legal, steps, needed, to, claim, title, to, each, indigenous, nation, s, lands, under, the, doctrine, of, discovery, the, expedition, was, sponsored, by, the, american, philosophical, society, aps, lewis, and, clark, received, some, instruction, in, astronomy, botany, climatology, ethnology, geography, meteorology, mineralogy, ornithology, and, zoology, during, the, expedition, they, made, contact, with, over, 70, native, american, tribes, and, described, more, than, 200, new, plant, and, animal, species, jefferson, had, the, expedition, declare, sovereignty, and, demonstrate, their, military, strength, to, ensure, native, tribes, would, be, subordinate, to, the, u, s, as, european, colonizers, did, elsewhere, after, the, expedition, the, maps, that, were, produced, allowed, the, further, discovery, and, settlement, of, this, vast, territory, in, the, years, that, followed, in, 1807, patrick, gass, a, private, in, the, u, s, army, published, an, account, of, the, journey, he, was, promoted, to, sergeant, during, the, course, of, the, expedition, paul, allen, edited, a, two, volume, history, of, the, lewis, and, clark, expedition, that, was, published, in, 1814, in, philadelphia, but, without, mention, of, the, actual, author, banker, nicholas, biddle, even, then, the, complete, report, was, not, made, public, until, more, recently, the, earliest, authorized, edition, of, the, lewis, and, clark, journals, resides, in, the, maureen, and, mike, mansfield, library, at, the, university, of, montana, one, of, the, expedition, s, primary, objectives, as, directed, by, president, jefferson, was, to, be, a, surveillance, mission, that, would, report, back, the, whereabouts, military, strength, lives, activities, and, cultures, of, the, various, native, american, tribes, that, inhabited, the, territory, newly, acquired, by, the, united, states, as, part, of, the, louisiana, purchase, and, the, northwest, in, general, the, expedition, was, to, make, native, people, understand, that, their, lands, now, belonged, to, the, united, states, and, that, their, great, father, in, washington, was, now, their, sovereign, the, expedition, encountered, many, different, native, nations, and, tribes, along, the, way, many, of, whom, offered, their, assistance, providing, the, expedition, with, their, knowledge, of, the, wilderness, and, with, the, acquisition, of, food, the, expedition, had, blank, leather, bound, journals, and, ink, for, the, purpose, of, recording, such, encounters, as, well, as, for, scientific, and, geological, information, they, were, also, provided, with, various, gifts, of, medals, ribbons, needles, mirrors, and, other, articles, which, were, intended, to, ease, any, tensions, when, negotiating, their, passage, with, the, various, native, american, chiefs, whom, they, would, encounter, along, their, way, many, of, the, tribes, had, friendly, experiences, with, british, and, french, fur, traders, in, various, isolated, encounters, along, the, missouri, and, columbia, rivers, and, for, the, most, part, the, expedition, did, not, encounter, hostilities, however, there, was, a, tense, confrontation, on, september, 25, 1804, with, the, teton, sioux, tribe, also, known, as, the, lakota, people, one, of, the, three, tribes, that, comprise, the, great, sioux, nation, under, chiefs, that, included, black, buffalo, and, the, partisan, these, chiefs, confronted, the, expedition, and, demanded, tribute, from, the, expedition, for, their, passage, over, the, river, the, seven, native, tribes, that, comprised, the, lakota, people, controlled, a, vast, inland, empire, and, expected, gifts, from, strangers, who, wished, to, navigate, their, rivers, or, to, pass, through, their, lands, according, to, harry, w, fritz, all, earlier, missouri, river, travelers, had, warned, of, this, powerful, and, aggressive, tribe, determined, to, block, free, trade, on, the, river, the, sioux, were, also, expecting, a, retaliatory, raid, from, the, omaha, tribe, to, the, south, a, recent, sioux, raid, had, killed, 75, omaha, men, burned, 40, lodges, and, taken, four, dozen, prisoners, captain, lewis, made, his, first, mistake, by, offering, the, sioux, chief, gifts, first, which, insulted, and, angered, the, partisan, chief, communication, was, difficult, since, the, expedition, s, only, sioux, language, interpreter, was, pierre, dorion, who, had, stayed, behind, with, the, other, party, and, was, also, involved, with, diplomatic, affairs, with, another, tribe, consequently, both, chiefs, were, offered, a, few, gifts, but, neither, was, satisfied, and, they, wanted, some, gifts, for, their, warriors, and, tribe, at, that, point, some, of, the, warriors, from, the, partisan, tribe, took, hold, of, their, boat, and, one, of, the, oars, lewis, took, a, firm, stand, ordering, a, display, of, force, and, presenting, arms, captain, clark, brandished, his, sword, and, threatened, violent, reprisal, just, before, the, situation, erupted, into, a, violent, confrontation, black, buffalo, ordered, his, warriors, to, back, off, the, captains, were, able, to, negotiate, their, passage, without, further, incident, with, the, aid, of, better, gifts, and, a, bottle, of, whiskey, during, the, next, two, days, the, expedition, made, camp, not, far, from, black, buffalo, s, tribe, similar, incidents, occurred, when, they, tried, to, leave, but, trouble, was, averted, with, gifts, of, tobacco, as, the, expedition, encountered, the, various, native, american, tribes, during, the, course, of, their, journey, they, observed, and, recorded, information, regarding, their, lifestyles, customs, and, the, social, codes, they, lived, by, as, directed, by, president, jefferson, by, european, standards, the, native, american, way, of, life, seemed, harsh, and, unforgiving, as, witnessed, by, members, of, the, expedition, after, many, encounters, and, camping, in, close, proximity, to, the, native, american, nations, for, extended, periods, of, time, during, the, winter, months, they, soon, learned, first, hand, of, their, customs, and, social, orders, one, of, the, primary, customs, that, distinguished, native, american, cultures, from, those, of, the, west, was, that, it, was, customary, for, the, men, to, take, on, two, or, more, wives, if, they, were, able, to, provide, for, them, and, often, took, on, a, wife, or, wives, who, were, members, of, the, immediate, family, circle, e, g, men, in, the, minnetaree, and, mandan, tribes, would, often, take, on, a, sister, for, a, wife, chastity, among, women, was, not, held, in, high, regard, infant, daughters, were, often, sold, by, the, father, to, men, who, were, grown, usually, for, horses, or, mules, women, in, sioux, nations, were, often, bartered, away, for, horses, or, other, supplies, yet, this, was, not, practiced, among, the, shoshone, nation, who, held, their, women, in, higher, regard, they, witnessed, that, many, of, the, native, american, nations, were, constantly, at, war, with, other, tribes, especially, the, sioux, who, while, remaining, generally, friendly, to, the, white, fur, traders, had, proudly, boasted, of, and, justified, the, almost, complete, destruction, of, the, once, great, cahokia, nation, along, with, the, missouris, illinois, kaskaskia, and, piorias, tribes, that, lived, about, the, countryside, adjacent, to, the, upper, mississippi, and, missouri, rivers, sacagawea, sometimes, spelled, sakajawea, or, sakagawea, c, 1788, december, 20, 1812, was, a, shoshone, native, american, woman, who, arrived, with, her, husband, and, owner, toussaint, charbonneau, on, the, expedition, to, the, pacific, ocean, on, february, 11, 1805, a, few, weeks, after, her, first, contact, with, the, expedition, sacagawea, went, into, labor, which, was, slow, and, painful, so, the, frenchman, charbonneau, suggested, she, be, given, a, potion, of, rattlesnake, s, rattle, to, aid, in, her, delivery, lewis, happened, to, have, some, snake, s, rattle, with, him, a, short, time, after, administering, the, potion, she, delivered, a, healthy, boy, who, was, given, the, name, jean, baptiste, charbonneau, when, the, expedition, reached, marias, river, on, june, 16, 1805, sacagawea, became, dangerously, ill, she, was, able, to, find, some, relief, by, drinking, mineral, water, from, the, sulphur, spring, that, fed, into, the, river, though, she, has, been, discussed, in, literature, frequently, much, of, the, information, is, exaggeration, or, fiction, scholars, say, she, did, notice, some, geographical, features, but, sacagawea, was, not, the, guide, for, the, expedition, she, was, important, to, them, as, an, interpreter, and, in, other, ways, the, sight, of, a, woman, and, her, infant, son, would, have, been, reassuring, to, some, indigenous, nations, and, she, played, an, important, role, in, diplomatic, relations, by, talking, to, chiefs, easing, tensions, and, giving, the, impression, of, a, peaceful, mission, in, his, writings, meriwether, lewis, presented, a, somewhat, negative, view, of, her, though, clark, had, a, higher, regard, for, her, and, provided, some, support, for, her, children, in, subsequent, years, in, the, journals, they, used, the, terms, squar, squaw, and, savages, to, refer, to, sacagawea, and, other, indigenous, peoples, an, enslaved, black, man, known, only, as, york, took, part, in, the, expedition, as, personal, servant, to, william, clark, his, enslaver, york, did, much, to, help, the, expedition, succeed, he, proved, popular, with, the, native, americans, who, had, never, seen, a, black, man, he, also, helped, with, hunting, and, the, heavy, labor, of, pulling, boats, upstream, despite, his, contributions, to, the, corps, of, discovery, clark, refused, to, release, york, from, bondage, upon, returning, east, while, all, the, other, explorers, enjoyed, rewards, of, double, pay, and, hundreds, of, acres, of, land, york, received, nothing, after, the, end, of, the, expedition, clark, allowed, york, only, a, brief, visit, to, kentucky, to, see, his, wife, before, forcing, him, to, return, to, missouri, it, is, unlikely, that, he, ever, saw, his, wife, again, ten, years, after, the, expedition, s, end, york, was, still, enslaved, working, as, a, wagoner, for, the, clark, family, the, last, years, of, york, s, life, are, disputed, in, the, 1830s, a, black, man, who, said, he, had, first, come, with, lewis, and, clark, was, living, as, a, chief, with, native, americans, they, met, on, the, expedition, in, modern, wyoming, the, corps, met, their, objective, of, reaching, the, pacific, mapping, and, establishing, their, presence, for, a, legal, claim, to, the, land, they, established, diplomatic, relations, and, trade, with, at, least, two, dozen, indigenous, nations, they, did, not, find, a, continuous, waterway, to, the, pacific, ocean, but, located, a, native, american, trail, that, led, from, the, upper, end, of, the, missouri, river, to, the, columbia, river, which, ran, to, the, pacific, ocean, they, gained, information, about, the, natural, habitat, flora, and, fauna, bringing, back, various, plant, seed, and, mineral, specimens, they, mapped, the, topography, of, the, land, designating, the, location, of, mountain, ranges, rivers, and, the, many, native, american, tribes, during, the, course, of, their, journey, they, also, learned, and, recorded, much, about, the, language, and, customs, of, the, native, american, tribes, they, encountered, and, brought, back, many, of, their, artifacts, including, bows, clothing, and, ceremonial, robes, two, months, passed, after, the, expedition, s, end, before, jefferson, made, his, first, public, statement, to, congress, and, others, giving, a, one, sentence, summary, about, the, success, of, the, expedition, before, getting, into, the, justification, for, the, expenses, involved, in, the, course, of, their, journey, they, acquired, a, knowledge, of, numerous, tribes, of, native, americans, hitherto, unknown, they, informed, themselves, of, the, trade, which, may, be, carried, on, with, them, the, best, channels, and, positions, for, it, and, they, are, enabled, to, give, with, accuracy, the, geography, of, the, line, they, pursued, back, east, the, botanical, and, zoological, discoveries, drew, the, intense, interest, of, the, american, philosophical, society, who, requested, specimens, various, artifacts, traded, with, the, native, americans, and, reports, on, plants, and, wildlife, along, with, various, seeds, obtained, jefferson, used, seeds, from, missouri, hominy, corn, along, with, a, number, of, other, unidentified, seeds, to, plant, at, monticello, which, he, cultivated, and, studied, he, later, reported, on, the, indian, corn, he, had, grown, as, being, an, excellent, food, source, the, expedition, helped, establish, the, u, s, presence, in, the, newly, acquired, territory, and, beyond, and, opened, the, door, to, further, exploration, trade, and, scientific, discoveries, lewis, and, clark, returned, from, their, expedition, bringing, with, them, the, mandan, native, american, chief, shehaka, from, the, upper, missouri, to, visit, the, great, father, in, washington, after, chief, shehaka, s, visit, it, required, multiple, attempts, and, multiple, military, expeditions, to, safely, return, shehaka, to, his, nation, upon, the, return, from, their, expedition, lewis, and, clark, struggled, to, prepare, their, manuscripts, for, publication, clark, managed, to, persuade, nicholas, biddle, to, edit, the, journals, which, were, then, published, in, 1814, as, the, history, of, the, expedition, under, the, commands, of, captains, lewis, and, clark, however, biddle, s, narrative, account, omitted, much, of, the, material, related, to, their, discoveries, in, flora, and, fauna, since, biddle, s, account, was, the, only, printed, account, of, the, original, journals, for, the, next, 90, years, many, of, lewis, and, clark, s, discoveries, were, later, unknowingly, rediscovered, and, given, new, names, it, wasn, t, until, 1904, 1905, through, the, publication, of, original, journals, of, the, lewis, and, clark, expedition, by, reuben, gold, thwaites, that, the, general, public, became, aware, of, the, full, extent, of, the, scientific, discoveries, made, by, the, expedition, 381, during, the, 19th, century, references, to, lewis, and, clark, scarcely, appeared, in, history, books, even, during, the, united, states, centennial, in, 1876, and, the, expedition, was, largely, forgotten, lewis, and, clark, began, to, gain, attention, around, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, both, the, 1904, louisiana, purchase, exposition, in, st, louis, and, the, 1905, lewis, and, clark, centennial, exposition, in, portland, oregon, showcased, them, as, american, pioneers, however, the, story, remained, relatively, shallow, until, mid, century, as, a, celebration, of, us, conquest, and, personal, adventures, but, more, recently, the, expedition, has, been, more, thoroughly, researched, as, of, 1984, no, us, exploration, party, was, more, famous, and, no, american, expedition, leaders, are, more, recognizable, by, name, in, 2004, a, complete, and, reliable, set, of, the, expedition, s, journals, was, compiled, by, gary, e, moulton, circa, 2004, the, bicentennial, of, the, expedition, further, elevated, popular, interest, in, lewis, and, clark, in, the, 1970s, the, federal, government, memorialized, the, winter, assembly, encampment, camp, dubois, as, the, start, of, the, lewis, and, clark, voyage, of, discovery, and, in, 2019, it, recognized, pittsburgh, pennsylvania, as, the, start, of, the, expedition, since, the, expedition, lewis, and, clark, have, been, commemorated, and, honored, over, the, years, on, various, coins, currency, and, commemorative, postage, stamps, as, well, as, in, a, number, of, other, capacities, in, 2004, the, american, elm, cultivar, ulmus, americana, lewis, clark, selling, name, prairie, expedition, was, released, by, north, dakota, state, university, research, foundation, in, commemoration, of, the, expedition, s,

mississippi, from, the, great, lakes, to, the, gulf, the, french, then, established, a, chain, of, posts, along, the, mississippi, from, new, orleans, to, the, great, lakes, there, followed, a, number, of, french, explorers, including, pedro, vial, and, pierre, antoine, and, paul, mallet, among, others, vial, may, have, preceded, lewis, and, clark, to, montana, in, 1787, he, gave, a, map, of, the, upper, missouri, river, and, locations, of, territories, transited, by, pedro, vial, to, spanish, authorities, early, in, 1792, the, american, explorer, robert, gray, sailing, in, the,
