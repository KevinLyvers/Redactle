empire, which, was, ceded, to, charles, the, bald, with, the, treaty, of, verdun, 843, a, branch, of, the, carolingian, dynasty, continued, to, rule, until, 987, when, hugh, capet, was, elected, king, and, founded, the, capetian, dynasty, the, territory, remained, known, as, francia, and, its, ruler, as, rex, francorum, king, of, the, franks, well, into, the, high, middle, ages, the, first, king, calling, himself, rex, francie, king, of, france, was, philip, ii, in, 1190, and, officially, from, 1204, from, then, france, was, continuously, ruled, by, the, capetians, and, their, cadet, lines, under, the, valois, and, bourbon, until, the, monarchy, was, abolished, in, 1792, during, the, french, revolution, the, kingdom, of, france, was, also, ruled, in, personal, union, with, the, kingdom, of, navarre, over, two, time, periods, 1284, 1328, and, 1572, 1620, after, which, the, institutions, of, navarre, were, abolished, and, it, was, fully, annexed, by, france, though, the, king, of, france, continued, to, use, the, title, king, of, navarre, through, the, end, of, the, monarchy, france, in, the, middle, ages, was, a, decentralised, feudal, monarchy, in, brittany, and, catalonia, the, latter, now, a, part, of, spain, as, well, as, aquitaine, the, authority, of, the, french, king, was, barely, felt, lorraine, and, burgundy, were, states, of, the, holy, roman, empire, and, not, yet, a, part, of, france, west, frankish, kings, were, initially, elected, by, the, secular, and, ecclesiastical, magnates, but, the, regular, coronation, of, the, eldest, son, of, the, reigning, king, during, his, father, s, lifetime, established, the, principle, of, male, primogeniture, which, became, codified, in, the, salic, law, during, the, late, middle, ages, rivalry, between, the, capetian, dynasty, rulers, of, the, kingdom, of, france, and, their, vassals, the, house, of, plantagenet, who, also, ruled, the, kingdom, of, england, as, part, of, their, so, called, competing, angevin, empire, resulted, in, many, armed, struggles, the, most, notorious, of, them, all, are, the, series, of, conflicts, known, as, the, hundred, years, war, 1337, 1453, in, which, the, kings, of, england, laid, claim, to, the, french, throne, emerging, victorious, from, said, conflicts, france, subsequently, sought, to, extend, its, influence, into, italy, but, after, initial, gains, was, defeated, by, spain, and, the, holy, roman, empire, in, the, ensuing, italian, wars, 1494, 1559, france, in, the, early, modern, era, was, increasingly, centralised, the, french, language, began, to, displace, other, languages, from, official, use, and, the, monarch, expanded, his, absolute, power, in, an, administrative, system, known, as, the, ancien, r, gime, complicated, by, historic, and, regional, irregularities, in, taxation, legal, judicial, and, ecclesiastic, divisions, and, local, prerogatives, religiously, france, became, divided, between, the, catholic, majority, and, a, protestant, minority, the, huguenots, which, led, to, a, series, of, civil, wars, the, wars, of, religion, 1562, 1598, the, wars, of, religion, crippled, france, but, triumph, over, spain, and, the, habsburg, monarchy, in, the, thirty, years, war, made, france, the, most, powerful, nation, on, the, continent, once, more, the, kingdom, became, europe, s, dominant, cultural, political, and, military, power, in, the, 17th, century, under, louis, xiv, throughout, the, 17th, 18th, and, early, 19th, centuries, france, was, europe, s, richest, largest, most, populous, powerful, and, influential, country, in, parallel, france, developed, its, first, colonial, empire, in, asia, africa, and, in, the, americas, in, the, 16th, to, the, 17th, centuries, the, first, french, colonial, empire, stretched, from, a, total, area, at, its, peak, in, 1680, to, over, 10, 000, 000, square, kilometres, 3, 900, 000, sq, mi, the, second, largest, empire, in, the, world, at, the, time, behind, the, spanish, empire, colonial, conflicts, with, great, britain, led, to, the, loss, of, much, of, its, north, american, holdings, by, 1763, french, intervention, in, the, american, revolutionary, war, helped, the, united, states, secure, independence, from, king, george, iii, and, the, kingdom, of, great, britain, but, was, costly, and, achieved, little, for, france, france, through, its, french, colonial, empire, became, a, superpower, from, 1643, until, 1815, from, the, reign, of, king, louis, xiv, until, the, defeat, of, napoleon, in, the, napoleonic, wars, the, spanish, empire, lost, its, superpower, status, to, france, after, the, signing, of, the, treaty, of, the, pyrenees, but, maintained, the, status, of, great, power, until, the, napoleonic, wars, and, the, independence, of, spanish, america, france, lost, its, superpower, status, after, napoleon, s, defeat, against, the, british, prussians, and, russians, in, 1815, following, the, french, revolution, which, began, in, 1789, the, kingdom, of, france, adopted, a, written, constitution, in, 1791, but, the, kingdom, was, abolished, a, year, later, and, replaced, with, the, first, french, republic, the, monarchy, was, restored, by, the, other, great, powers, in, 1814, and, with, the, exception, of, the, hundred, days, in, 1815, lasted, until, the, french, revolution, of, 1848, during, the, later, years, of, charlemagne, s, rule, the, vikings, made, advances, along, the, northern, and, western, perimeters, of, the, kingdom, of, the, franks, after, charlemagne, s, death, in, 814, his, heirs, were, incapable, of, maintaining, political, unity, and, the, empire, began, to, crumble, the, treaty, of, verdun, of, 843, divided, the, carolingian, empire, into, three, parts, with, charles, the, bald, ruling, over, west, francia, the, nucleus, of, what, would, develop, into, the, kingdom, of, france, charles, the, bald, was, also, crowned, king, of, lotharingia, after, the, death, of, lothair, ii, in, 869, but, in, the, treaty, of, meerssen, 870, was, forced, to, cede, much, of, lotharingia, to, his, brothers, retaining, the, rh, ne, and, meuse, basins, including, verdun, vienne, and, besan, on, but, leaving, the, rhineland, with, aachen, metz, and, trier, in, east, francia, viking, incursions, up, the, loire, the, seine, and, other, inland, waterways, increased, during, the, reign, of, charles, the, simple, 898, 922, vikings, under, rollo, from, scandinavia, settled, along, the, seine, downstream, from, paris, in, a, region, that, came, to, be, known, as, normandy, the, carolingians, were, to, share, the, fate, of, their, predecessors, after, an, intermittent, power, struggle, between, the, two, dynasties, the, accession, in, 987, of, hugh, capet, duke, of, france, and, count, of, paris, established, the, capetian, dynasty, on, the, throne, with, its, offshoots, the, houses, of, valois, and, bourbon, it, was, to, rule, france, for, more, than, 800, years, the, old, order, left, the, new, dynasty, in, immediate, control, of, little, beyond, the, middle, seine, and, adjacent, territories, while, powerful, territorial, lords, such, as, the, 10th, and, 11th, century, counts, of, blois, accumulated, large, domains, of, their, own, through, marriage, and, through, private, arrangements, with, lesser, nobles, for, protection, and, support, the, area, around, the, lower, seine, became, a, source, of, particular, concern, when, duke, william, of, normandy, took, possession, of, the, kingdom, of, england, by, the, norman, conquest, of, 1066, making, himself, and, his, heirs, the, king, s, equal, outside, france, where, he, was, still, nominally, subject, to, the, crown, henry, ii, inherited, the, duchy, of, normandy, and, the, county, of, anjou, and, married, france, s, newly, single, ex, queen, eleanor, of, aquitaine, who, ruled, much, of, southwest, france, in, 1152, after, defeating, a, revolt, led, by, eleanor, and, three, of, their, four, sons, henry, had, eleanor, imprisoned, made, the, duke, of, brittany, his, vassal, and, in, effect, ruled, the, western, half, of, france, as, a, greater, power, than, the, french, throne, however, disputes, among, henry, s, descendants, over, the, division, of, his, french, territories, coupled, with, john, of, england, s, lengthy, quarrel, with, philip, ii, allowed, philip, to, recover, influence, over, most, of, this, territory, after, the, french, victory, at, the, battle, of, bouvines, in, 1214, the, english, monarchs, maintained, power, only, in, southwestern, duchy, of, aquitaine, the, death, of, charles, iv, of, france, in, 1328, without, male, heirs, ended, the, main, capetian, line, under, salic, law, the, crown, could, not, pass, through, a, woman, philip, iv, s, daughter, was, isabella, whose, son, was, edward, iii, of, england, so, the, throne, passed, to, philip, vi, son, of, charles, of, valois, this, in, addition, to, a, long, standing, dispute, over, the, rights, to, gascony, in, the, south, of, france, and, the, relationship, between, england, and, the, flemish, cloth, towns, led, to, the, hundred, years, war, of, 1337, 1453, the, following, century, was, to, see, devastating, warfare, the, armagnac, burgundian, civil, war, peasant, revolts, the, english, peasants, revolt, of, 1381, and, the, jacquerie, of, 1358, in, france, and, the, growth, of, nationalism, in, both, countries, the, losses, of, the, century, of, war, were, enormous, particularly, owing, to, the, plague, the, black, death, usually, considered, an, outbreak, of, bubonic, plague, which, arrived, from, italy, in, 1348, spreading, rapidly, up, the, rh, ne, valley, and, thence, across, most, of, the, country, it, is, estimated, that, a, population, of, some, 18, 20, million, in, modern, day, france, at, the, time, of, the, 1328, hearth, tax, returns, had, been, reduced, 150, years, later, by, 50, percent, or, more, the, renaissance, era, was, noted, for, the, emergence, of, powerful, centralized, institutions, as, well, as, a, flourishing, culture, much, of, it, imported, from, italy, the, kings, built, a, strong, fiscal, system, which, heightened, the, power, of, the, king, to, raise, armies, that, overawed, the, local, nobility, in, paris, especially, there, emerged, strong, traditions, in, literature, art, and, music, the, prevailing, style, was, classical, the, ordinance, of, villers, cotter, ts, was, signed, into, law, by, francis, i, in, 1539, largely, the, work, of, chancellor, guillaume, poyet, it, dealt, with, a, number, of, government, judicial, and, ecclesiastical, matters, articles, 110, and, 111, the, most, famous, called, for, the, use, of, the, french, language, in, all, legal, acts, notarised, contracts, and, official, legislation, after, the, hundred, years, war, charles, viii, of, france, signed, three, additional, treaties, with, henry, vii, of, england, emperor, maximilian, i, and, ferdinand, ii, of, aragon, respectively, at, taples, 1492, senlis, 1493, and, barcelona, 1493, these, three, treaties, cleared, the, way, for, france, to, undertake, the, long, italian, wars, 1494, 1559, which, marked, the, beginning, of, early, modern, france, french, efforts, to, gain, dominance, resulted, only, in, the, increased, power, of, the, house, of, habsburg, barely, were, the, italian, wars, over, when, france, was, plunged, into, a, domestic, crisis, with, far, reaching, consequences, despite, the, conclusion, of, a, concordat, between, france, and, the, papacy, 1516, granting, the, crown, unrivalled, power, in, senior, ecclesiastical, appointments, france, was, deeply, affected, by, the, protestant, reformation, s, attempt, to, break, the, hegemony, of, catholic, europe, a, growing, urban, based, protestant, minority, later, dubbed, huguenots, faced, ever, harsher, repression, under, the, rule, of, francis, i, s, son, king, henry, ii, after, henry, ii, s, death, in, a, joust, the, country, was, ruled, by, his, widow, catherine, de, medici, and, her, sons, francis, ii, charles, ix, and, henry, iii, renewed, catholic, reaction, headed, by, the, powerful, dukes, of, guise, culminated, in, a, massacre, of, huguenots, 1572, starting, the, first, of, the, french, wars, of, religion, during, which, english, german, and, spanish, forces, intervened, on, the, side, of, rival, protestant, and, catholic, forces, opposed, to, absolute, monarchy, the, huguenot, monarchomachs, theorized, during, this, time, the, right, of, rebellion, and, the, legitimacy, of, tyrannicide, the, wars, of, religion, culminated, in, the, war, of, the, three, henrys, in, which, henry, iii, assassinated, henry, de, guise, leader, of, the, spanish, backed, catholic, league, and, the, king, was, murdered, in, return, after, the, assassination, of, both, henry, of, guise, 1588, and, henry, iii, 1589, the, conflict, was, ended, by, the, accession, of, the, protestant, king, of, navarre, as, henry, iv, first, king, of, the, bourbon, dynasty, and, his, subsequent, abandonment, of, protestantism, expedient, of, 1592, effective, in, 1593, his, acceptance, by, most, of, the, catholic, establishment, 1594, and, by, the, pope, 1595, and, his, issue, of, the, toleration, decree, known, as, the, edict, of, nantes, 1598, which, guaranteed, freedom, of, private, worship, and, civil, equality, france, s, pacification, under, henry, iv, laid, much, of, the, ground, for, the, beginnings, of, france, s, rise, to, european, hegemony, france, was, expansive, during, all, but, the, end, of, the, seventeenth, century, the, french, began, trading, in, india, and, madagascar, founded, quebec, and, penetrated, the, north, american, great, lakes, and, mississippi, established, plantation, economies, in, the, west, indies, and, extended, their, trade, contacts, in, the, levant, and, enlarged, their, merchant, marine, henry, iv, s, son, louis, xiii, and, his, minister, 1624, 1642, cardinal, richelieu, elaborated, a, policy, against, spain, and, the, holy, roman, empire, during, the, thirty, years, war, 1618, 1648, which, had, broken, out, in, germany, after, the, death, of, both, king, and, cardinal, the, peace, of, westphalia, 1648, secured, universal, acceptance, of, germany, s, political, and, religious, fragmentation, but, the, regency, of, anne, of, austria, and, her, minister, cardinal, mazarin, experienced, a, civil, uprising, known, as, the, fronde, 1648, 1653, which, expanded, into, a, franco, spanish, war, 1635, 1659, the, treaty, of, the, pyrenees, 1659, formalised, france, s, seizure, 1642, of, the, spanish, territory, of, roussillon, after, the, crushing, of, the, ephemeral, catalan, republic, and, ushered, a, short, period, of, peace, the, ancien, r, gime, a, french, term, rendered, in, english, as, old, rule, or, simply, former, regime, refers, primarily, to, the, aristocratic, social, and, political, system, of, early, modern, france, under, the, late, valois, and, bourbon, dynasties, the, administrative, and, social, structures, of, the, ancien, r, gime, were, the, result, of, years, of, state, building, legislative, acts, like, the, ordinance, of, villers, cotter, ts, internal, conflicts, and, civil, wars, but, they, remained, a, confusing, patchwork, of, local, privilege, and, historic, differences, until, the, french, revolution, brought, about, a, radical, suppression, of, administrative, incoherence, for, most, of, the, reign, of, louis, xiv, 1643, 1715, the, sun, king, france, was, the, dominant, power, in, europe, aided, by, the, diplomacy, of, cardinal, richelieu, s, successor, as, the, king, s, chief, minister, 1642, 61, cardinal, jules, mazarin, 1602, 1661, cardinal, mazarin, oversaw, the, creation, of, a, french, royal, navy, that, rivalled, england, s, expanding, it, from, 25, ships, to, almost, 200, the, size, of, the, french, royal, army, was, also, considerably, increased, renewed, wars, the, war, of, devolution, 1667, 1668, and, the, franco, dutch, war, 1672, 1678, brought, further, territorial, gains, artois, and, western, flanders, and, the, free, county, of, burgundy, previously, left, to, the, empire, in, 1482, but, at, the, cost, of, the, increasingly, concerted, opposition, of, rival, royal, powers, and, a, legacy, of, an, increasingly, enormous, national, debt, an, adherent, of, the, theory, of, the, divine, right, of, kings, which, advocates, the, divine, origin, of, temporal, power, and, any, lack, of, earthly, restraint, of, monarchical, rule, louis, xiv, continued, his, predecessors, work, of, creating, a, centralized, state, governed, from, the, capital, of, paris, he, sought, to, eliminate, the, remnants, of, feudalism, still, persisting, in, parts, of, france, and, by, compelling, the, noble, elite, to, regularly, inhabit, his, lavish, palace, of, versailles, built, on, the, outskirts, of, paris, succeeded, in, pacifying, the, aristocracy, many, members, of, which, had, participated, in, the, earlier, fronde, rebellion, during, louis, minority, by, these, means, he, consolidated, a, system, of, absolute, monarchy, in, france, that, endured, 150, years, until, the, french, revolution, mccabe, says, critics, used, fiction, to, portray, the, degraded, turkish, court, using, the, harem, the, sultan, court, oriental, despotism, luxury, gems, and, spices, carpets, and, silk, cushions, as, an, unfavorable, analogy, to, the, corruption, of, the, french, royal, court, the, king, sought, to, impose, total, religious, uniformity, on, the, country, repealing, the, edict, of, nantes, in, 1685, it, is, estimated, that, anywhere, between, 150, 000, and, 300, 000, protestants, fled, france, during, the, wave, of, persecution, that, followed, the, repeal, following, huguenots, beginning, a, hundred, and, fifty, years, earlier, until, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, costing, the, country, a, great, many, intellectuals, artisans, and, other, valuable, people, persecution, extended, to, unorthodox, roman, catholics, like, the, jansenists, a, group, that, denied, free, will, and, had, already, been, condemned, by, the, popes, in, this, he, garnered, the, friendship, of, the, papacy, which, had, previously, been, hostile, to, france, because, of, its, policy, of, putting, all, church, property, in, the, country, under, the, jurisdiction, of, the, state, rather, than, that, of, rome, in, november, 1700, king, charles, ii, of, spain, died, ending, the, habsburg, line, in, that, country, louis, had, long, planned, for, this, moment, but, these, plans, were, thrown, into, disarray, by, the, will, of, king, charles, which, left, the, entire, spanish, empire, to, louis, s, grandson, philip, duke, of, anjou, 1683, 1746, essentially, spain, was, to, become, a, perpetual, ally, and, even, obedient, satellite, of, france, ruled, by, a, king, who, would, carry, out, orders, from, versailles, realizing, how, this, would, upset, the, balance, of, power, the, other, european, rulers, were, outraged, however, most, of, the, alternatives, were, equally, undesirable, for, example, putting, another, habsburg, on, the, throne, would, end, up, recreating, the, grand, multi, national, empire, of, charles, v, of, the, holy, roman, empire, spain, and, the, spanish, territories, in, italy, which, would, also, grossly, upset, the, power, balance, after, nine, years, of, exhausting, war, the, last, thing, louis, wanted, was, another, conflict, however, the, rest, of, europe, would, not, stand, for, his, ambitions, in, spain, and, so, the, long, war, of, the, spanish, succession, began, 1701, 1714, a, mere, three, years, after, the, war, of, the, grand, alliance, 1688, 1697, a, k, a, war, of, the, league, of, augsburg, had, just, concluded, the, reign, 1715, 1774, of, louis, xv, saw, an, initial, return, to, peace, and, prosperity, under, the, regency, 1715, 1723, of, philippe, ii, duke, of, orl, ans, whose, policies, were, largely, continued, 1726, 1743, by, cardinal, fleury, prime, minister, in, all, but, name, the, exhaustion, of, europe, after, two, major, wars, resulted, in, a, long, period, of, peace, only, interrupted, by, minor, conflicts, like, the, war, of, the, polish, succession, from, 1733, to, 1735, large, scale, warfare, resumed, with, the, war, of, the, austrian, succession, 1740, 1748, but, alliance, with, the, traditional, habsburg, enemy, the, diplomatic, revolution, of, 1756, against, the, rising, power, of, britain, and, prussia, led, to, costly, failure, in, the, seven, years, war, 1756, 63, and, the, loss, of, france, s, north, american, colonies, on, the, whole, the, 18th, century, saw, growing, discontent, with, the, monarchy, and, the, established, order, louis, xv, was, a, highly, unpopular, king, for, his, sexual, excesses, overall, weakness, and, for, losing, new, france, to, the, british, a, strong, ruler, like, louis, xiv, could, enhance, the, position, of, the, monarchy, while, louis, xv, weakened, it, the, writings, of, the, philosophes, such, as, voltaire, were, a, clear, sign, of, discontent, but, the, king, chose, to, ignore, them, he, died, of, smallpox, in, 1774, and, the, french, people, shed, few, tears, at, his, death, while, france, had, not, yet, experienced, the, industrial, revolution, that, was, beginning, in, britain, the, rising, middle, class, of, the, cities, felt, increasingly, frustrated, with, a, system, and, rulers, that, seemed, silly, frivolous, aloof, and, antiquated, even, if, true, feudalism, no, longer, existed, in, france, upon, louis, xv, s, death, his, grandson, louis, xvi, became, king, initially, popular, he, too, came, to, be, widely, detested, by, the, 1780s, he, was, married, to, an, austrian, archduchess, marie, antoinette, french, intervention, in, the, american, war, of, independence, was, also, very, expensive, with, the, country, deeply, in, debt, louis, xvi, permitted, the, radical, reforms, of, turgot, and, malesherbes, but, noble, disaffection, led, to, turgot, s, dismissal, and, malesherbes, resignation, in, 1776, they, were, replaced, by, jacques, necker, necker, had, resigned, in, 1781, to, be, replaced, by, calonne, and, brienne, before, being, restored, in, 1788, a, harsh, winter, that, year, led, to, widespread, food, shortages, and, by, then, france, was, a, powder, keg, ready, to, explode, on, the, eve, of, the, french, revolution, of, july, 1789, france, was, in, a, profound, institutional, and, financial, crisis, but, the, ideas, of, the, enlightenment, had, begun, to, permeate, the, educated, classes, of, society, on, september, 3, 1791, the, absolute, monarchy, which, had, governed, france, for, 948, years, was, forced, to, limit, its, power, and, become, a, provisional, constitutional, monarchy, however, this, too, would, not, last, very, long, and, on, september, 21, 1792, the, french, monarchy, was, effectively, abolished, by, the, proclamation, of, the, french, first, republic, the, role, of, the, king, in, france, was, finally, ended, with, the, execution, of, louis, xvi, by, guillotine, on, monday, january, 21, 1793, followed, by, the, reign, of, terror, mass, executions, and, the, provisional, directory, form, of, republican, government, and, the, eventual, beginnings, of, twenty, five, years, of, reform, upheaval, dictatorship, wars, and, renewal, with, the, various, napoleonic, wars, following, the, french, revolution, 1789, 99, and, the, first, french, empire, under, napoleon, 1804, 1814, the,
