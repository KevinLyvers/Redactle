1200, bc, the, site, was, first, discovered, in, 1929, and, then, re, discovered, in, 1986, chinese, archaeologists, have, identified, the, sanxingdui, culture, to, be, part, of, the, state, of, shu, linking, the, artifacts, found, at, the, site, to, its, early, legendary, kings, ferrous, metallurgy, begins, to, appear, in, the, late, 6th, century, in, the, yangtze, valley, a, bronze, hatchet, with, a, blade, of, meteoric, iron, excavated, near, the, city, of, gaocheng, in, shijiazhuang, now, hebei, has, been, dated, to, the, 14th, century, bc, an, iron, age, culture, of, the, tibetan, plateau, has, tentatively, been, associated, with, the, zhang, zhung, culture, described, in, early, tibetan, writings, chinese, historians, in, later, periods, were, accustomed, to, the, notion, of, one, dynasty, succeeding, another, but, the, political, situation, in, early, china, was, much, more, complicated, hence, as, some, scholars, of, china, suggest, the, xia, and, the, shang, can, refer, to, political, entities, that, existed, concurrently, just, as, the, early, zhou, existed, at, the, same, time, as, the, shang, this, bears, similarities, to, how, china, both, contemporaneously, and, later, has, been, divided, into, states, that, were, not, one, region, legally, or, culturally, the, earliest, period, once, considered, historical, was, the, legendary, era, of, the, sage, emperors, yao, shun, and, yu, traditionally, the, abdication, system, was, prominent, in, this, period, with, yao, yielding, his, throne, to, shun, who, abdicated, to, yu, who, founded, the, xia, dynasty, the, xia, dynasty, c, 2070, c, 1600, bc, is, the, earliest, of, the, three, dynasties, described, in, much, later, traditional, historiography, which, includes, the, bamboo, annals, and, sima, qian, s, shiji, c, 91, bc, the, xia, is, generally, considered, mythical, by, western, scholars, but, in, china, it, is, usually, associated, with, the, early, bronze, age, site, at, erlitou, 1900, 1500, bc, in, henan, that, was, excavated, in, 1959, since, no, writing, was, excavated, at, erlitou, or, any, other, contemporaneous, site, there, is, not, enough, evidence, to, prove, whether, the, xia, dynasty, ever, existed, some, archaeologists, claim, that, the, erlitou, site, was, the, capital, of, the, xia, in, any, case, the, site, of, erlitou, had, a, level, of, political, organization, that, would, not, be, incompatible, with, the, legends, of, xia, recorded, in, later, texts, more, importantly, the, erlitou, site, has, the, earliest, evidence, for, an, elite, who, conducted, rituals, using, cast, bronze, vessels, which, would, later, be, adopted, by, the, shang, and, zhou, both, archaeological, evidence, like, oracle, bones, and, bronzes, as, well, as, transmitted, texts, attest, the, historical, existence, of, the, shang, dynasty, c, 1600, c, 1046, bc, findings, from, the, earlier, shang, period, come, from, excavations, at, erligang, modern, zhengzhou, findings, have, been, found, at, yinxu, near, modern, anyang, henan, the, site, of, the, final, shang, capital, during, the, late, shang, period, c, 1250, 1050, bc, the, findings, at, anyang, include, the, earliest, written, record, of, the, chinese, so, far, discovered, inscriptions, of, divination, records, in, ancient, chinese, writing, on, the, bones, or, shells, of, animals, the, oracle, bones, dating, from, c, 1250, c, 1046, bc, a, series, of, at, least, twenty, nine, kings, reigned, over, the, shang, dynasty, throughout, their, reigns, according, to, the, shiji, the, capital, city, was, moved, six, times, the, final, and, most, important, move, was, to, yin, during, the, reign, of, wu, ding, c, 1250, bc, the, term, yin, dynasty, has, been, synonymous, with, the, shang, dynasty, in, history, although, it, has, lately, been, used, to, refer, specifically, to, the, latter, half, of, the, shang, dynasty, although, written, records, found, at, anyang, confirm, the, existence, of, the, shang, dynasty, western, scholars, are, often, hesitant, to, associate, settlements, that, are, contemporaneous, with, the, anyang, settlement, with, the, shang, dynasty, for, example, archaeological, findings, at, sanxingdui, suggest, a, technologically, advanced, civilization, culturally, unlike, anyang, the, evidence, is, inconclusive, in, proving, how, far, the, shang, realm, extended, from, anyang, the, leading, hypothesis, is, that, anyang, ruled, by, the, same, shang, in, the, official, history, coexisted, and, traded, with, numerous, other, culturally, diverse, settlements, in, the, area, that, is, now, referred, to, as, china, proper, the, zhou, dynasty, 1046, bc, to, about, 256, bc, is, the, longest, lasting, dynasty, in, chinese, history, though, its, power, declined, steadily, over, the, almost, eight, centuries, of, its, existence, in, the, late, 2nd, millennium, bc, the, zhou, dynasty, arose, in, the, wei, river, valley, of, modern, western, shaanxi, province, where, they, were, appointed, western, protectors, by, the, shang, a, coalition, led, by, the, ruler, of, the, zhou, king, wu, defeated, the, shang, at, the, battle, of, muye, they, took, over, most, of, the, central, and, lower, yellow, river, valley, and, enfeoffed, their, relatives, and, allies, in, semi, independent, states, across, the, region, several, of, these, states, eventually, became, more, powerful, than, the, zhou, kings, the, kings, of, zhou, invoked, the, concept, of, the, mandate, of, heaven, to, legitimize, their, rule, a, concept, that, was, influential, for, almost, every, succeeding, dynasty, like, shangdi, heaven, tian, ruled, over, all, the, other, gods, and, it, decided, who, would, rule, china, it, was, believed, that, a, ruler, lost, the, mandate, of, heaven, when, natural, disasters, occurred, in, great, number, and, when, more, realistically, the, sovereign, had, apparently, lost, his, concern, for, the, people, in, response, the, royal, house, would, be, overthrown, and, a, new, house, would, rule, having, been, granted, the, mandate, of, heaven, the, zhou, established, two, capitals, zongzhou, near, modern, xi, an, and, chengzhou, luoyang, with, the, king, s, court, moving, between, them, regularly, the, zhou, alliance, gradually, expanded, eastward, into, shandong, southeastward, into, the, huai, river, valley, and, southward, into, the, yangtze, river, valley, in, 771, bc, king, you, and, his, forces, were, defeated, in, the, battle, of, mount, li, by, rebel, states, and, quanrong, barbarians, the, rebel, aristocrats, established, a, new, ruler, king, ping, in, luoyang, 4, beginning, the, second, major, phase, of, the, zhou, dynasty, the, eastern, zhou, period, which, is, divided, into, the, spring, and, autumn, and, warring, states, periods, the, former, period, is, named, after, the, famous, spring, and, autumn, annals, the, sharply, reduced, political, authority, of, the, royal, house, left, a, power, vacuum, at, the, center, of, the, zhou, culture, sphere, the, zhou, kings, had, delegated, local, political, authority, to, hundreds, of, settlement, states, some, of, them, only, as, large, as, a, walled, town, and, surrounding, land, these, states, began, to, fight, against, one, another, and, vie, for, hegemony, the, more, powerful, states, tended, to, conquer, and, incorporate, the, weaker, ones, so, the, number, of, states, declined, over, time, by, the, 6th, century, bc, most, small, states, had, disappeared, by, being, annexed, and, just, a, few, large, and, powerful, principalities, remained, some, southern, states, such, as, chu, and, wu, claimed, independence, from, the, zhou, who, undertook, wars, against, some, of, them, wu, and, yue, many, new, cities, were, established, in, this, period, and, society, gradually, became, more, urbanized, and, commercialized, many, famous, individuals, such, as, laozi, confucius, and, sun, tzu, lived, during, this, chaotic, period, conflict, in, this, period, occurred, both, between, and, within, states, warfare, between, states, forced, the, surviving, states, to, develop, better, administrations, to, mobilize, more, soldiers, and, resources, within, states, there, was, constant, jockeying, between, elite, families, for, example, the, three, most, powerful, families, in, the, jin, state, zhao, wei, and, han, eventually, overthrew, the, ruling, family, and, partitioned, the, state, between, them, the, hundred, schools, of, thought, of, classical, chinese, philosophy, began, blossoming, during, this, period, and, the, subsequent, warring, states, period, such, influential, intellectual, movements, as, confucianism, taoism, legalism, and, mohism, were, founded, partly, in, response, to, the, changing, political, world, the, first, two, philosophical, thoughts, would, have, an, enormous, influence, on, chinese, culture, after, further, political, consolidations, seven, prominent, states, remained, during, the, 5th, century, bc, the, years, in, which, these, states, battled, each, other, is, known, as, the, warring, states, period, though, the, zhou, king, nominally, remained, as, such, until, 256, bc, he, was, largely, a, figurehead, that, held, little, real, power, numerous, developments, were, made, during, this, period, in, the, areas, of, culture, and, mathematics, including, the, zuo, zhuan, within, the, spring, and, autumn, annals, a, literary, work, summarizing, the, preceding, spring, and, autumn, period, and, the, bundle, of, 21, bamboo, slips, from, the, tsinghua, collection, dated, to, 305, bc, being, the, world, s, earliest, known, example, of, a, two, digit, base, 10, multiplication, table, the, tsinghua, collection, indicates, that, sophisticated, commercial, arithmetic, was, already, established, during, this, period, as, neighboring, territories, of, the, seven, states, were, annexed, including, areas, of, modern, sichuan, and, liaoning, they, were, now, to, be, governed, under, an, administrative, system, of, commanderies, and, prefectures, this, system, had, been, in, use, elsewhere, since, the, spring, and, autumn, period, and, its, influence, on, administration, would, prove, resilient, its, terminology, can, still, be, seen, in, the, contemporaneous, sheng, and, xian, provinces, and, counties, of, contemporary, china, the, state, of, qin, became, dominant, in, the, waning, decades, of, the, warring, states, period, conquering, the, shu, capital, of, jinsha, on, the, chengdu, plain, and, then, eventually, driving, chu, from, its, place, in, the, han, river,

due, only, to, mongol, killings, scholars, such, as, frederick, w, mote, argue, that, the, wide, drop, in, numbers, reflects, an, administrative, failure, to, record, rather, than, an, actual,
