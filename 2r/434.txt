in, october, 1973, the, organization, of, arab, petroleum, exporting, countries, oapec, announced, that, it, was, implementing, a, total, oil, embargo, against, the, countries, who, had, supported, israel, at, any, point, during, the, 1973, yom, kippur, war, which, began, after, egypt, and, syria, launched, a, large, scale, surprise, attack, in, an, ultimately, unsuccessful, attempt, to, recover, the, territories, that, they, had, lost, to, israel, during, the, 1967, six, day, war, in, an, effort, that, was, led, by, faisal, of, saudi, arabia, the, initial, countries, that, oapec, targeted, were, canada, japan, the, netherlands, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, this, list, was, later, expanded, to, include, portugal, rhodesia, and, south, africa, in, march, 1974, oapec, lifted, the, embargo, but, the, price, of, oil, had, risen, by, nearly, 300, from, us, 3, per, barrel, 19, m, 3, to, nearly, us, 12, per, barrel, 75, m, 3, globally, prices, in, the, united, states, were, significantly, higher, than, the, global, average, after, it, was, implemented, the, embargo, caused, an, oil, crisis, or, shock, with, many, short, and, long, term, effects, on, the, global, economy, as, well, as, on, global, politics, the, 1973, embargo, later, came, to, be, referred, to, as, the, first, oil, shock, vis, vis, the, second, oil, shock, that, was, the, 1979, oil, crisis, brought, upon, by, the, iranian, revolution, ever, since, israel, declared, independence, in, 1948, there, was, conflict, between, arabs, and, israelis, in, the, middle, east, including, several, wars, the, suez, crisis, also, known, as, the, second, arab, israeli, war, was, sparked, by, israel, s, southern, port, of, eilat, being, blocked, by, egypt, which, also, nationalized, the, suez, canal, belonging, to, french, and, british, investors, as, a, result, of, the, war, the, suez, canal, was, closed, for, several, months, between, 1956, and, 1957, the, six, day, war, of, 1967, included, an, israeli, invasion, of, the, egyptian, sinai, peninsula, which, resulted, in, egypt, closing, the, suez, canal, for, eight, years, following, the, yom, kippur, war, the, canal, was, cleared, in, 1974, and, opened, again, in, 1975, oapec, countries, cut, production, of, oil, and, placed, an, embargo, on, oil, exports, to, the, united, states, after, richard, nixon, requested, 2, 2, billion, to, support, israel, s, war, effort, nevertheless, the, embargo, lasted, only, until, january, 1974, though, the, price, of, oil, remained, high, afterwards, by, 1969, american, domestic, output, of, oil, was, peaking, and, could, not, keep, pace, with, increasing, demand, from, vehicles, the, u, s, was, importing, 350, million, barrels, 56, million, cubic, metres, per, year, by, the, late, 1950s, mostly, from, venezuela, and, canada, because, of, transportation, costs, and, tariffs, it, never, purchased, much, oil, from, the, middle, east, in, 1973, us, production, had, declined, to, 16, of, global, output, eisenhower, imposed, quotas, on, foreign, oil, that, would, stay, in, place, between, 1959, and, 1973, critics, called, it, the, drain, america, first, policy, some, scholars, believe, the, policy, contributed, to, the, decline, of, domestic, us, oil, production, in, the, early, 1970s, the, cheapness, of, oil, compared, with, coal, led, to, the, decline, of, the, coal, industry, in, 1951, 51, of, america, s, energy, came, from, coal, and, by, 1973, only, 19, of, america, s, industry, was, coal, based, when, richard, nixon, became, president, in, 1969, he, assigned, george, shultz, to, head, a, committee, to, review, the, eisenhower, era, quota, program, shultz, s, committee, recommended, that, the, quotas, be, abolished, and, replaced, with, tariffs, but, nixon, decided, to, keep, the, quotas, due, to, vigorous, political, opposition, nixon, imposed, a, price, ceiling, on, oil, in, 1971, as, demand, for, oil, was, increasing, and, production, was, declining, which, increased, dependence, on, foreign, oil, imports, as, consumption, was, bolstered, by, low, prices, in, 1973, nixon, announced, the, end, of, the, quota, system, between, 1970, and, 1973, us, imports, of, crude, oil, had, nearly, doubled, reaching, 6, 2, million, barrels, per, day, in, 1973, until, 1973, an, abundance, of, oil, supply, had, kept, the, market, price, of, oil, lower, than, the, posted, price, in, 1970, american, oil, production, peaked, and, the, united, states, began, to, import, more, and, more, oil, as, oil, imports, rose, by, 52, between, 1969, and, 1972, by, 1972, 83, of, the, american, oil, imports, came, from, the, middle, east, throughout, the, 1960s, the, price, for, a, barrel, of, oil, remained, at, 1, 80, meaning, that, with, the, effects, of, inflation, considered, the, price, of, oil, in, real, terms, got, progressively, lower, and, lower, throughout, the, decade, with, americans, paying, less, for, oil, in, 1969, than, they, had, in, 1959, even, after, a, price, for, a, barrel, of, oil, rose, to, 2, 00, in, 1971, adjusted, for, inflation, people, in, the, western, nations, were, paying, less, for, oil, in, 1971, than, they, had, in, 1958, the, extremely, low, price, of, oil, served, as, the, basis, for, the, long, summer, of, prosperity, and, mass, affluence, that, began, in, 1945, the, organization, of, petroleum, exporting, countries, opec, was, founded, by, five, oil, producing, countries, at, a, baghdad, conference, on, september, 14, 1960, the, five, founding, members, of, opec, were, venezuela, iraq, saudi, arabia, iran, and, kuwait, opec, was, organized, after, the, oil, companies, slashed, the, posted, price, of, oil, but, the, posted, price, of, oil, remained, consistently, higher, than, the, market, price, of, oil, between, 1961, and, 1972, in, 1963, the, seven, sisters, controlled, 86, of, the, oil, produced, by, opec, countries, but, by, 1970, the, rise, of, independent, oil, companies, had, decreased, their, share, to, 77, the, entry, of, three, new, oil, producers, algeria, libya, and, nigeria, meant, that, by, 1970, 81, oil, companies, were, doing, business, in, the, middle, east, in, the, early, 1960s, libya, indonesia, and, qatar, joined, opec, opec, was, generally, regarded, as, ineffective, until, political, turbulence, in, libya, and, iraq, strengthened, their, position, in, 1970, additionally, increasing, soviet, influence, provided, oil, producing, countries, with, alternative, means, of, transporting, oil, to, markets, under, the, tehran, price, agreement, of, 1971, signed, on, february, 14, the, posted, price, of, oil, was, increased, and, due, to, a, decline, in, the, value, of, the, us, dollar, relative, to, gold, certain, anti, inflationary, measures, were, enacted, because, of, a, severe, drain, on, u, s, gold, reserves, leading, to, higher, inflation, and, lack, of, confidence, in, the, strength, of, the, dollar, president, nixon, issued, executive, order, 11615, on, august, 15, 1971, closing, the, gold, window, this, action, made, the, dollar, inconvertible, to, gold, directly, except, on, the, open, market, and, was, soon, dubbed, the, nixon, shock, leading, eventually, to, the, collapse, of, the, bretton, woods, system, in, 1976, because, oil, was, priced, in, dollars, oil, producers, real, income, decreased, when, the, dollar, started, to, float, free, of, the, old, link, to, gold, in, september, 1971, opec, issued, a, joint, communiqu, stating, that, from, then, on, they, would, price, oil, in, terms, of, a, fixed, amount, of, gold, after, 1971, opec, was, slow, to, readjust, prices, to, reflect, this, depreciation, from, 1947, to, 1967, the, dollar, price, of, oil, had, risen, by, less, than, two, percent, per, year, until, the, oil, shock, the, price, had, also, remained, fairly, stable, versus, other, currencies, and, commodities, opec, ministers, had, not, developed, institutional, mechanisms, to, update, prices, in, sync, with, changing, market, conditions, so, their, real, incomes, lagged, the, substantial, price, increases, of, 1973, 1974, largely, returned, their, prices, and, corresponding, incomes, to, former, levels, in, terms, of, commodities, such, as, gold, arab, oil, producing, countries, had, attempted, to, use, oil, as, leverage, to, influence, political, events, on, two, prior, occasions, the, first, was, the, suez, crisis, in, 1956, when, the, united, kingdom, france, and, israel, invaded, egypt, during, the, conflict, the, syrians, sabotaged, both, the, trans, arabian, pipeline, and, the, iraq, baniyas, pipeline, which, disrupted, the, supply, of, oil, to, western, europe, the, second, instance, was, when, war, broke, out, between, egypt, and, israel, in, 1967, but, despite, continued, egyptian, and, syrian, enmity, against, israel, the, embargo, lasted, only, a, few, months, most, scholars, agree, that, the, 1967, embargo, was, ineffective, although, some, members, of, the, organization, of, arab, petroleum, exporting, countries, oapec, supported, the, use, of, oil, as, a, weapon, to, influence, the, political, outcome, of, the, arab, israeli, conflict, saudi, arabia, had, traditionally, been, the, strongest, supporter, of, separating, oil, from, politics, the, saudis, were, wary, of, the, tactic, due, to, the, availability, of, oil, from, non, arab, oil, producing, countries, and, in, the, decades, leading, up, to, the, crisis, the, region, s, conservative, monarchies, had, grown, dependent, on, western, support, to, ensure, their, continued, survival, as, nasserism, gained, traction, on, the, other, hand, algeria, iraq, and, libya, had, strongly, supported, the, use, of, oil, as, a, weapon, in, the, conflict, arab, newspapers, like, the, egyptian, al, ahram, lebanese, an, nahar, and, iraqi, al, thawra, had, historically, been, supportive, of, the, use, of, oil, as, a, weapon, in, 1970, president, nasser, of, egypt, died, and, was, succeeded, by, anwar, sadat, a, man, who, believed, in, the, diplomacy, of, surprise, in, engaging, in, sudden, moves, to, upset, the, diplomatic, equilibrium, sadat, liked, to, say, that, his, favourite, game, was, backgammon, a, game, where, skill, and, persistence, was, rewarded, but, was, best, won, by, sudden, gambles, making, an, analogy, between, how, he, played, backgammon, and, conducted, his, diplomacy, under, nasser, egypt, and, saudi, arabia, had, engaged, what, was, known, as, the, arab, cold, war, but, sadat, got, along, very, well, with, king, faisal, of, saudi, arabia, forming, an, alliance, between, the, most, populous, arab, state, and, the, wealthiest, arab, state, unlike, the, secularist, nasser, sadat, was, a, pious, muslim, and, he, had, a, strong, personal, rapport, with, king, faisal, who, was, an, equally, pious, muslim, the, man, largely, in, charge, of, american, foreign, policy, the, national, security, adviser, henry, kissinger, later, admitted, that, he, was, so, engrossed, with, the, paris, peace, talks, to, end, the, vietnam, war, that, he, and, others, in, washington, missed, the, significance, of, the, egyptian, saudi, alliance, at, the, same, time, that, sadat, moved, closer, to, saudi, arabia, he, also, wanted, a, rapprochement, with, the, united, states, and, to, move, egypt, away, from, its, alliance, with, the, soviet, union, in, 1971, the, us, had, information, that, the, arab, states, were, willing, to, implement, another, embargo, in, july, 1972, sadat, expelled, all, 16, 000, of, the, soviet, military, personnel, in, egypt, in, a, signal, that, he, wanted, better, relations, with, the, united, states, kissinger, was, taken, completely, by, surprise, by, sadat, s, move, saying, why, has, he, done, me, this, favor, why, didn, t, he, demand, all, sorts, of, concessions, first, sadat, expected, as, a, reward, that, the, united, states, would, respond, by, pressuring, israel, to, return, the, sinai, to, egypt, but, after, his, anti, soviet, move, prompted, no, response, from, the, united, states, by, november, 1972, sadat, moved, again, closer, to, the, soviet, union, buying, a, massive, amount, of, soviet, arms, for, a, war, he, planned, to, launch, against, israel, in, 1973, for, sadat, cost, was, no, object, as, the, money, to, buy, soviet, arms, came, from, saudi, arabia, at, the, same, time, faisal, promised, sadat, that, if, it, should, come, to, war, saudi, arabia, would, embargo, oil, to, the, west, in, april, 1973, the, saudi, oil, minister, ahmed, zaki, yamani, visited, washington, to, meet, kissinger, and, told, him, that, king, faisal, was, becoming, more, and, more, unhappy, with, the, united, states, saying, he, wanted, america, to, pressure, israel, to, return, all, the, lands, captured, in, the, six, day, war, of, 1967, in, a, later, interview, yamani, accused, kissinger, of, not, taking, his, warning, seriously, saying, all, he, did, was, to, ask, him, not, to, speak, anymore, of, this, threat, angry, at, kissinger, yamani, in, an, interview, with, the, washington, post, on, april, 19, 1973, warned, that, king, faisal, was, considering, an, oil, embargo, at, the, time, the, general, feeling, in, washington, was, the, saudis, were, bluffing, and, nothing, would, come, of, their, threat, to, impose, an, oil, embargo, the, fact, that, faisal, s, ineffectual, half, brother, king, saud, had, imposed, a, cripplingly, oil, embargo, on, britain, and, france, during, the, suez, war, of, 1956, was, not, considered, an, important, precedent, the, ceos, of, four, of, america, s, oil, companies, had, after, speaking, to, faisal, arrived, in, washington, in, may, 1973, with, the, warning, that, faisal, was, considerably, tougher, more, intelligent, and, more, ruthless, than, his, half, brother, saud, whom, he, had, deposed, in, 1964, and, his, threats, were, serious, kissinger, declined, to, meet, the, four, ceos, in, an, assessment, done, by, kissinger, and, his, staff, about, the, middle, east, in, the, summer, of, 1973, the, repeated, statements, by, sadat, about, waging, jihad, against, israel, were, dismissed, as, empty, talk, while, the, warnings, from, king, faisal, were, likewise, regarded, as, inconsequential, in, september, 1973, nixon, fired, rogers, as, secretary, of, state, and, replaced, him, with, kissinger, kissinger, was, later, to, state, he, had, not, been, given, enough, time, to, know, the, middle, east, as, he, settled, into, the, state, department, s, office, at, foggy, bottom, as, egypt, and, syria, attacked, israel, on, october, 6, 1973, on, october, 6, 1973, egypt, attacked, the, bar, lev, line, in, the, sinai, peninsula, and, syria, launched, an, offensive, in, the, golan, heights, both, of, which, had, been, occupied, by, israel, during, the, 1967, six, day, war, the, war, began, during, the, height, of, the, watergate, scandal, and, nixon, largely, let, kissinger, manage, foreign, policy, as, he, was, distracted, by, the, scandal, on, 8, october, 1973, faisal, told, two, egyptian, envoys, you, have, made, us, all, proud, in, the, past, we, could, not, lift, our, heads, up, now, we, can, faisal, promised, to, give, to, egypt, a, quality, of, aid, worth, 200, million, us, dollars, to, assist, with, the, war, effort, and, stated, he, was, willing, to, use, the, oil, weapon, if, necessary, to, support, egypt, kissinger, promised, the, israeli, prime, minister, golda, meir, the, united, states, would, replace, its, losses, in, equipment, after, the, war, but, sought, initially, to, delay, arm, shipments, to, israel, as, he, believed, it, would, improve, the, odds, of, making, peace, along, the, lines, of, united, nations, security, council, resolution, 242, calling, for, a, land, for, peace, deal, if, an, armistice, was, signed, with, egypt, and, syria, gaining, some, territory, in, the, sinai, and, the, golan, heights, respectively, nixon, had, ordered, an, arms, lift, to, israel, on, 12, october, 1973, but, kissinger, used, the, excuse, of, bureaucratic, delays, to, limit, the, amount, of, weapons, and, ammunition, sent, to, israel, the, arab, concept, of, the, peace, of, the, brave, i, e, a, victorious, leader, being, magnanimous, to, his, defeated, opponents, meant, there, was, a, possibility, that, sadat, at, least, would, make, peace, with, israel, provided, that, the, war, ended, in, such, a, way, that, egypt, was, not, perceived, to, be, defeated, likewise, kissinger, regarded, meir, as, being, rather, arrogant, and, believed, that, an, armistice, that, ended, the, war, in, a, manner, that, was, not, an, unambiguous, israeli, victory, would, make, her, more, humble, as, both, syria, and, egypt, lost, much, equipment, during, the, fighting, the, soviet, union, began, to, fly, new, equipment, in, starting, on, october, 12, and, the, soviet, flights, to, syria, and, egypt, were, recorded, by, the, british, radar, stations, in, cyprus, though, the, soviets, were, flying, in, an, average, of, 60, flights, per, day, exaggerated, accounts, appeared, in, western, newspapers, speaking, of, one, hundred, flights, per, day, at, this, point, both, nixon, and, kissinger, began, to, see, the, october, war, more, in, terms, of, the, cold, war, rather, than, middle, eastern, politics, both, seeing, the, soviet, arms, lifts, to, egypt, and, syria, as, a, soviet, power, play, that, required, an, american, answer, on, october, 12, 1973, us, president, richard, nixon, authorized, operation, nickel, grass, a, strategic, airlift, to, deliver, weapons, and, supplies, to, israel, in, order, to, replace, its, materiel, losses, after, the, soviet, union, began, sending, arms, to, syria, and, egypt, the, first, american, weapons, to, israel, arrived, only, on, 15, october, 1973, and, despite, nixon, s, orders, the, number, of, american, planes, flying, into, tel, aviv, were, initially, limited, after, the, first, week, of, the, war, the, israelis, had, halted, the, syrian, offensive, in, the, golan, heights, and, were, pushing, back, the, syrians, back, towards, damascus, but, along, the, suez, canal, there, was, heavy, fighting, with, the, egyptians, holding, their, own, yamani, stated, in, a, 1981, interview, the, king, still, wanted, to, give, america, a, chance, to, stay, out, of, the, fighting, so, we, agreed, to, cut, back, production, by, just, 5, percent, per, month, a, full, embargo, we, agreed, was, something, we, would, implement, only, if, we, felt, that, things, were, absolutely, hopeless, at, an, opec, summit, at, the, sheraton, hotel, in, kuwait, city, on, october, 16, 1973, it, was, announced, the, price, of, oil, would, go, from, 3, 01, u, s, dollars, per, barrel, to, 5, 12, per, barrel, after, agreeing, to, the, price, increase, the, iranian, delegation, left, kuwait, city, as, the, shah, of, iran, was, only, interested, in, higher, oil, prices, the, oil, minister, of, iraq, sa, dun, hammadi, demanded, the, total, nationalization, of, all, assets, of, american, oil, companies, in, the, middle, east, the, withdrawal, of, all, arab, funds, from, the, united, states, and, for, all, arab, states, to, break, diplomatic, relations, with, the, united, states, the, libyan, oil, minister, izz, al, din, al, mabruk, called, for, the, nationalization, of, all, the, assets, of, all, western, oil, companies, in, the, middle, east, the, news, about, the, war, on, october, 16, was, grim, from, the, arab, viewpoint, with, the, syrians, steadily, being, pushed, back, while, israelis, had, opened, an, counter, offensive, against, the, egyptians, and, crossed, the, great, bitter, lake, the, saudi, delegation, led, by, yemani, supported, by, the, algerian, delegation, fought, hard, against, the, iraqi, and, libyan, demands, for, an, embargo, as, yemani, maintained, that, forcing, through, an, increase, in, the, price, of, oil, was, the, best, way, to, influence, the, united, states, hammadi, and, the, rest, of, the, iraqi, delegation, left, in, a, huff, as, yemani, had, won, over, the, majority, of, the, delegations, to, the, saudi, viewpoint, the, statement, issued, after, midnight, at, the, sheraton, hotel, was, handwritten, and, reflecting, the, tense, talk, had, several, paragraphs, crossed, out, while, other, paragraphs, were, written, in, by, different, hands, on, october, 17, arab, oil, producers, cut, production, by, 5, and, instituted, an, oil, embargo, against, israel, s, allies, the, united, states, the, netherlands, rhodesia, south, africa, and, portugal, on, october, 17, 19, 1973, the, saudi, foreign, minister, omar, al, saqqaf, visited, washington, together, with, the, foreign, ministers, of, algeria, kuwait, and, morocco, to, warn, that, there, was, a, real, possibility, of, an, oil, embargo, being, imposed, saqqaf, complained, to, king, faisal, that, nixon, seemed, more, interested, in, a, dispute, about, a, burglary, i, e, the, watergate, scandal, than, about, the, october, war, during, a, press, conference, an, american, reporter, mocked, the, threat, contemptuously, saying, the, saudis, could, drink, their, oil, leading, saqqaf, to, reply, in, anger, all, right, we, will, joined, by, the, foreign, ministers, of, algeria, kuwait, and, morocco, saqqaf, met, with, nixon, in, the, oval, office, who, promised, him, that, the, united, states, would, mediate, a, settlement, to, the, war, that, would, be, peaceful, just, and, honorable, to, both, sides, saqqaf, reported, to, king, faisal, that, nixon, told, him, that, he, ended, the, vietnam, war, on, an, honorable, basis, and, now, intended, to, end, the, october, war, in, the, same, manner, israel, took, heavy, losses, in, men, and, material, during, the, fighting, against, egypt, and, syria, and, on, october, 18, 1973, meir, requested, 850, million, worth, of, american, arms, and, equipment, to, replace, its, material, losses, nixon, decided, characteristically, to, act, on, an, epic, scale, and, instead, of, the, 850, million, worth, of, arms, requested, sent, a, request, to, congress, for, some, 2, 2, billion, worth, of, arms, to, israel, which, was, promptly, approved, nixon, whose, administration, was, being, badly, battered, by, the, watergate, scandal, felt, that, a, bold, foreign, policy, move, might, resuscitate, his, administration, nixon, later, boasted, in, his, memoirs, that, the, u, s, air, force, flew, more, sorties, to, israel, in, october, 1973, than, it, had, during, the, berlin, airlift, of, 1948, 49, flying, in, a, gargantuan, quantity, of, arms, though, he, also, admitted, that, by, the, time, the, arms, lift, had, begun, the, israelis, had, already, turned, the, tide, of, battle, in, their, favor, making, the, arms, lift, irrelevant, to, the, outcome, of, the, war, in, an, interview, with, the, british, historian, robert, lacey, in, 1981, kissinger, later, admitted, about, the, arms, lift, to, israel, i, made, a, mistake, in, retrospect, it, was, not, the, best, considered, decision, we, made, the, arms, lift, enraged, king, faisal, of, saudi, arabia, and, he, retaliated, on, october, 20, 1973, by, placing, a, total, embargo, on, oil, shipments, to, the, united, states, to, be, joined, by, all, of, the, other, oil, producing, arab, states, except, iraq, and, libya, faisal, was, angry, that, israel, had, only, asked, for, 850, million, worth, of, american, weapons, and, instead, received, an, unsolicited, 2, 2, billion, worth, of, weapons, which, he, perceived, as, a, sign, of, the, pro, israeli, slant, of, american, foreign, policy, faisal, also, felt, insulted, that, nixon, had, just, promised, saqqaf, a, honorable, peace, the, day, before, he, submitted, the, request, to, congress, for, some, 2, 2, billion, worth, of, arms, for, israel, which, he, saw, as, an, act, of, duplicity, on, nixon, s, part, faisal, had, been, opposed, to, a, total, embargo, and, only, agreed, to, the, 5, cut, on, october, 17, under, pressure, from, other, arab, states, faisal, felt, his, efforts, on, behalf, the, united, states, were, not, being, appreciated, in, washington, which, increased, his, fury, at, nixon, saudi, arabia, only, consented, to, the, embargo, after, nixon, s, promise, of, 2, 2, billion, in, military, aid, to, israel, on, the, afternoon, of, october, 19, 1973, faisal, was, in, his, office, when, he, learned, about, the, united, states, sending, 2, 2, billion, worth, of, weapons, to, israel, and, discussed, the, issue, with, two, of, his, closest, advisers, abdullah, ibn, abdul, rahman, and, rashad, pharaon, the, king, called, yamani, at, about, 8, pm, and, told, him, he, was, needed, at, the, riyassa, palace, immediately, yamani, told, the, king, the, tv, news, goes, out, at, nine, if, you, make, a, decision, now, we, can, get, it, announced, at, once, the, king, replied, write, this, down, and, announced, he, was, placing, a, total, embargo, on, the, united, states, the, embargo, was, accompanied, by, gradual, monthly, production, cuts, by, december, production, had, been, cut, to, 25, of, september, levels, this, contributed, to, a, global, recession, and, increased, tension, between, the, united, states, and, several, of, its, european, allies, who, faulted, the, us, for, provoking, an, embargo, by, providing, what, many, viewed, as, unconditional, assistance, to, israel, oapec, demanded, a, complete, israeli, withdrawal, from, all, territories, beyond, the, 1949, armistice, border, the, embargo, lasted, from, october, 1973, to, march, 1974, during, a, summit, in, cairo, on, november, 6, kissinger, asked, sadat, what, faisal, was, like, and, was, told, well, dr, henry, he, will, probably, go, on, with, you, about, communism, and, the, jews, king, faisal, s, two, great, hatreds, were, communism, and, zionism, as, he, believed, that, the, soviet, union, and, israel, were, plotting, together, against, islam, when, king, faisal, was, shown, a, translation, into, arabic, of, the, protocols, of, the, learned, elders, of, zion, he, instantly, believed, in, the, authenticity, of, the, protocols, and, therefore, talked, to, anyone, who, would, listen, about, what, he, had, learned, despite, the, fact, that, the, protocols, had, been, exposed, as, a, forgery, in, 1921, initially, secretary, of, defense, james, schlesinger, suggested, to, kissinger, that, the, usa, invade, saudi, arabia, and, another, arab, countries, and, seize, their, oil, fields, kissinger, stated, in, a, private, state, department, meeting, that, it, s, ridiculous, that, the, civilized, world, is, held, up, by, 8, million, savages, can, t, we, overthrow, one, of, the, sheikhs, just, to, show, that, we, can, do, it, they, formed, a, plan, to, invade, abu, dhabi, kuwait, and, saudi, arabia, kissinger, publicly, threatened, countermeasures, in, a, nov, 21st, 1973, press, conference, if, the, embargo, was, not, lifted, and, the, saudis, responded, with, threatening, further, oil, cuts, and, to, burn, their, oil, fields, if, the, us, military, invaded, after, the, cia, confirmed, these, threats, kissinger, gave, up, military, intervention, and, decided, that, dealing, with, israel, s, troop, withdrawals, and, settled, on, diplomatic, solutions, to, the, oil, embargo, on, november, 7, 1973, kissinger, flew, to, riyadh, to, meet, king, faisal, and, ask, him, to, end, the, oil, embargo, in, exchange, for, promising, to, be, evenhanded, with, the, arab, israeli, dispute, as, the, plane, carrying, him, prepared, to, land, in, riyadh, kissinger, was, clearly, nervous, at, the, prospect, of, negotiating, with, the, stern, wahhabi, faisal, who, had, a, marked, dislike, of, jews, kissinger, discovered, that, king, faisal, was, a, worthy, companion, to, l, c, th, in, terms, of, stubbornness, as, the, king, accused, the, united, states, of, being, biased, in, favor, of, israel, going, on, in, a, long, rant, about, the, balefulness, of, jewish, communists, in, russia, and, israel, and, despite, all, of, kissinger, s, efforts, to, charm, him, refused, to, end, the, oil, embargo, faisal, told, kissinger, the, united, states, used, to, stand, up, to, aggression, you, did, that, in, world, war, two, and, in, 1956, during, the, suez, war, if, the, united, states, had, done, the, same, after, 1967, we, would, not, have, witnessed, the, this, deterioration, before, the, jewish, state, was, established, there, existed, nothing, to, harm, good, relations, between, arabs, and, jews, there, were, many, jews, in, arab, countries, when, the, jews, were, persecuted, in, spain, arabs, protected, them, when, the, romans, drove, the, jews, out, arabs, protected, them, at, yalta, it, was, stalin, who, said, there, had, to, be, a, jewish, state, israel, is, advancing, communist, objectives, among, those, of, the, jewish, faith, there, are, those, who, embrace, zionism, most, of, the, immigration, to, israel, is, from, the, soviet, union, they, want, to, establish, a, communist, base, right, in, the, middle, east, and, now, all, over, the, world, the, jews, are, putting, themselves, into, positions, of, authority, on, february, 22, 1974, king, faisal, chaired, the, second, summit, of, islamic, states, in, lahore, which, unlike, the, first, summit, that, faisal, had, chaired, in, 1969, was, not, boycotted, by, iraq, and, syria, where, he, was, acclaimed, as, a, conquering, hero, who, humiliated, and, humbled, the, west, by, wrecking, its, economy, the, prime, minister, of, pakistan, zulfikar, ali, bhutto, opened, the, conference, by, stating, the, armies, of, pakistan, are, the, armies, of, islam, we, shall, enter, jerusalem, as, brothers, in, arms, only, on, march, 18, 1974, did, the, king, end, the, oil, embargo, after, sadat, whom, he, trusted, reported, to, him, that, the, united, states, was, being, more, evenhanded, and, after, kissinger, had, promised, to, sell, saudi, arabia, weapons, that, it, had, previously, denied, under, the, grounds, that, they, might, be, used, against, israel, more, importantly, saudi, arabia, had, billions, of, dollars, invested, in, western, banks, and, the, massive, bout, of, inflation, set, off, by, the, oil, embargo, was, a, threat, to, this, fortune, as, inflation, eroded, the, value, of, the, money, giving, faisal, a, vested, interest, in, helping, to, contain, the, damage, he, himself, inflicted, on, the, economies, of, the, west, since, israeli, forces, did, not, withdraw, to, the, 1949, armistice, line, the, majority, of, scholars, believe, that, the, embargo, was, a, failure, roy, licklieder, in, his, 1988, book, political, power, and, the, arab, oil, weapon, concluded, that, the, embargo, was, a, failure, because, the, countries, that, were, targeted, by, the, embargo, did, not, change, their, policies, on, the, arab, israeli, conflict, licklieder, believed, that, any, long, term, changes, were, caused, by, the, opec, increase, in, the, posted, price, of, oil, and, not, the, oapec, embargo, daniel, yergin, on, the, other, hand, has, said, that, the, embargo, remade, the, international, economy, lacey, wrote, king, faisal, s, momentous, oil, embargo, of, 20, october, 1973, did, not, achieve, a, single, one, of, its, stated, objectives, the, ceasefire, which, the, usa, and, the, ussr, together, imposed, two, days, later, upon, israel, syria, and, egypt, would, have, been, imposed, in, any, case, israel, ended, the, october, war, thanks, to, us, aid, better, equipped, militarily, than, she, had, ever, been, before, and, faisal, s, ambition, to, shrink, israel, back, inside, her, pre, 1949, boundaries, remains, unfulfilled, to, this, day, nor, did, the, withholding, of, the, 638, 500, barrels, of, oil, which, the, saudi, arabia, had, been, selling, to, america, every, day, for, the, first, 10, months, of, 1973, ever, come, in, itself, to, jeopardizing, the, power, or, diverting, the, policies, of, the, united, states, since, it, accounted, for, less, than, 4, percent, of, america, s, daily, 17, million, barrel, consumption, it, was, the, interaction, which, faisal, s, embargo, had, with, other, forces, that, made, it, so, decisive, arab, politics, had, an, immediate, multiplier, effect, because, every, arab, state, except, for, iraq, and, libya, joined, the, oil, embargo, oil, exports, from, the, middle, east, to, the, west, were, down, by, 60, 70, by, november, 1973, japan, and, the, nations, of, western, europe, imported, some, 75, of, their, oil, from, the, near, east, and, the, embargo, led, to, immediate, and, sharp, price, raises, as, lacey, noted, that, competing, desperately, for, dwindling, supplies, consumers, showed, themselves, willing, to, pay, unparalleled, money, for, their, oil, saudi, arabia, had, 25, of, the, world, s, oil, reserves, and, the, embargo, imposed, on, the, united, states, led, to, shortages, of, oil, in, the, united, states, which, set, an, inflationary, spiral, as, the, new, high, prices, for, oil, in, the, american, market, led, to, sharp, increases, of, the, price, of, oil, in, nations, not, subjected, to, the, embargo, when, the, iranian, state, oil, company, held, an, auction, on, december, 16, 1973, bids, for, some, 17, us, dollars, per, barrel, of, oil, were, made, in, late, december, 1973, opec, held, a, conference, in, vienna, when, it, was, announced, the, price, for, a, barrel, of, oil, was, to, from, 5, us, dollars, per, barrel, to, 11, 65, us, dollars, per, barrel, faisal, was, opposed, to, the, price, increase, which, was, largely, the, work, of, the, iranian, delegation, over, the, long, term, the, oil, embargo, changed, the, nature, of, policy, in, the, west, towards, increased, exploration, alternative, energy, research, energy, conservation, and, more, restrictive, monetary, policy, to, better, fight, inflation, for, further, details, see, the, energy, crisis, series, by, facts, on, file, the, effects, of, the, embargo, were, immediate, opec, forced, oil, companies, to, increase, payments, drastically, the, price, of, oil, quadrupled, by, 1974, from, us, 3, to, nearly, us, 12, per, 42, gallon, barrel, 75, per, cubic, meter, equivalent, in, 2018, dollars, to, a, price, rise, from, 17, to, 61, per, barrel, saudi, arabia, had, 25, of, the, world, s, oil, but, only, 4, of, the, oil, used, in, the, united, states, in, 1973, came, from, the, kingdom, however, saudi, arabia, plays, an, over, sized, role, within, the, arab, world, and, as, a, beirut, oil, consultant, noted, in, 1974, if, saudi, arabia, moves, from, a, to, b, then, every, other, oil, producer, must, move, at, least, as, far, if, not, to, c, in, 1973, about, 25, of, the, oil, used, in, the, united, states, came, from, arab, countries, the, mere, shortage, of, oil, caused, by, the, arab, oil, embargo, within, the, united, states, forced, prices, to, raise, which, in, turn, led, prices, to, rise, everywhere, all, over, the, world, as, oil, producers, that, had, not, joined, the, embargo, such, as, iran, venezuela, libya, and, iraq, demanded, higher, prices, in, japan, and, europe, as, an, initiative, to, ship, oil, to, those, places, instead, of, the, united, states, thus, settling, off, a, worldwide, inflationary, spiral, the, only, european, nations, subject, to, the, oil, embargo, were, the, netherlands, because, the, dutch, foreign, minister, max, van, der, stoel, was, strongly, pro, israeli, and, portugal, in, a, support, of, show, for, the, independence, movements, in, portugal, s, african, colonies, but, the, shortage, of, oil, in, the, united, states, led, to, sharp, price, rises, in, all, of, the, european, nations, the, embargo, itself, did, not, cause, much, economic, difficulty, in, the, united, states, as, the, americans, simply, imported, more, oil, from, nations, that, were, not, part, of, the, embargo, such, as, iran, but, the, 400, increase, in, the, price, of, oil, caused, by, the, embargo, did, damage, the, american, economy, a, number, of, nations, such, as, venezuela, nigeria, iran, and, iraq, increased, their, oil, production, during, the, embargo, but, just, sold, their, oil, at, a, higher, price, the, leader, who, pushed, the, most, for, higher, oil, prices, was, the, shah, of, iran, and, the, italian, historian, giuliano, garavini, has, argued, that, the, leader, most, responsible, for, the, west, s, economic, problems, during, the, oil, shock, was, not, king, faisal, but, rather, the, shah, some, of, the, nations, that, were, classified, as, friendly, to, the, arab, viewpoint, in, regards, to, the, arab, israeli, dispute, such, as, france, and, belgium, were, the, ones, who, suffered, the, most, from, the, worldwide, inflation, caused, by, the, embargo, the, crisis, eased, when, the, embargo, was, lifted, in, march, 1974, after, negotiations, at, the, washington, oil, summit, but, the, effects, lingered, throughout, the, 1970s, the, dollar, price, of, energy, increased, again, the, following, year, amid, the, weakening, competitive, position, of, the, dollar, in, world, markets, the, arab, oil, embargo, ended, the, long, period, of, prosperity, in, the, west, that, had, begun, in, 1945, throwing, the, world, s, economy, into, the, steepest, economic, contraction, since, the, great, depression, the, long, summer, of, prosperity, in, the, post, war, years, had, made, possible, the, swinging, sixties, and, the, related, rise, of, a, rebellious, youth, culture, as, it, was, very, easy, to, be, hedonist, and, or, in, rebellion, against, traditional, values, in, a, time, of, unprecedented, affluence, and, prosperity, lacey, wrote, about, the, impact, of, the, arab, oil, embargo, of, 1973, 74, that, for, people, in, the, west, life, suddenly, become, slower, darker, and, chiller, as, gasoline, was, rationed, the, lights, were, turned, off, in, times, square, the, gas, guzzler, automobiles, suddenly, stopped, selling, speed, limits, became, common, and, restrictions, were, placed, on, weekend, driving, in, a, bid, to, conserve, fuel, as, the, american, automobile, industry, specialized, in, producing, heavy, gas, guzzler, vehicles, there, was, an, immediate, shift, on, the, part, of, consumers, to, the, lighter, and, more, fuel, efficient, vehicles, produced, by, the, japanese, and, west, german, automobile, industries, sending, the, american, automobile, industry, into, decline, the, years, from, 1945, to, 1973, had, been, a, period, of, unprecedented, prosperity, in, the, west, a, long, summer, that, many, believed, would, never, end, and, its, abrupt, end, in, 1973, as, the, oil, embargo, which, increased, the, price, of, oil, by, 400, within, a, matter, of, days, threw, the, world, s, economy, into, a, sharp, recession, with, unemployment, mounting, and, inflation, raging, came, as, a, profound, shock, the, end, of, what, the, french, called, the, trente, glorieuses, glorious, thirty, led, to, a, mood, of, widespread, pessimism, in, the, west, with, the, financial, times, running, a, famous, headline, in, late, 1973, saying, the, future, will, be, subject, to, delay, kurt, waldheim, the, secretary, general, of, the, united, nations, in, an, address, to, the, general, assembly, complained, about, the, note, of, helplessness, and, fatalism, creeping, into, world, affairs, the, sudden, and, abrupt, end, of, the, long, summer, of, prosperity, in, 1973, 1974, played, a, major, role, in, the, pessimistic, mood, that, characterized, the, culture, of, the, rest, of, the, 1970s, in, 1975, a, report, to, congress, from, the, federal, energy, administration, estimated, that, the, embargo, of, 1973, 1974, had, caused, about, 500, 000, americans, to, lose, their, jobs, and, caused, a, gnp, loss, between, 10, billion, 20, billion, this, price, increase, had, a, dramatic, effect, on, oil, exporting, nations, for, the, countries, of, the, middle, east, who, had, long, been, dominated, by, the, industrial, powers, were, seen, to, have, taken, control, of, a, vital, commodity, the, oil, exporting, nations, began, to, accumulate, vast, wealth, some, of, the, income, was, dispensed, in, the, form, of, aid, to, other, underdeveloped, nations, whose, economies, had, been, caught, between, higher, oil, prices, and, lower, prices, for, their, own, export, commodities, amid, shrinking, western, demand, much, went, for, arms, purchases, that, exacerbated, political, tensions, particularly, in, the, middle, east, saudi, arabia, spent, over, 100, billion, dollars, in, the, ensuing, decades, for, helping, spread, its, fundamentalist, interpretation, of, islam, known, as, wahhabism, throughout, the, world, via, religious, charities, such, as, the, al, haramain, foundation, which, often, also, distributed, funds, to, violent, sunni, extremist, groups, such, as, al, qaeda, and, the, taliban, the, 400, increase, in, the, world, oil, prices, led, to, extravagant, promises, being, made, by, the, leaders, of, oil, producing, nations, the, shah, of, iran, told, his, subjects, in, a, speech, in, december, 1973, that, he, was, launching, great, civilization, project, that, would, make, iran, into, a, first, world, nation, by, the, 1990s, president, carlos, andr, s, p, rez, of, venezuela, likewise, launched, his, le, gran, venezuela, project, intended, to, make, venezuela, into, a, first, world, nation, and, president, yakubu, gowon, of, nigeria, told, his, people, that, henceforward, nigeria, s, main, problem, would, be, managing, abundance, after, the, oil, shock, nigeria, presented, itself, as, the, first, african, nation, that, would, reach, first, world, status, and, in, lagos, a, series, of, stately, modernist, buildings, were, erected, as, appropriate, for, a, nation, that, saw, itself, as, the, leader, of, all, black, africa, much, of, the, oil, wealth, in, nigeria, was, stolen, by, corrupt, politicians, however, at, least, some, of, nigeria, s, new, oil, wealth, went, to, rebuild, the, areas, devastated, by, the, civil, war, of, 1967, 1970, and, to, address, the, complaints, that, too, much, of, nigeria, s, oil, wealth, went, to, the, federal, government, in, lagos, instead, of, the, people, in, iran, the, shah, who, was, aware, by, 1974, that, he, had, developed, the, cancer, that, was, to, ultimately, kill, him, in, 1980, pushed, very, strongly, for, his, great, civilization, for, rapid, modernization, not, the, least, because, he, wanted, to, see, the, great, civilization, before, his, death, which, explained, his, grandiose, announcements, the, new, wealth, generated, by, the, oil, shock, allowed, for, chairman, houari, boum, di, ne, of, algeria, to, become, a, global, leader, courted, by, elites, in, both, the, first, world, and, the, third, world, the, oil, embargo, led, a, sudden, interest, in, the, palestinian, issue, between, 1973, and, 1981, saudi, arabia, donated, a, sum, worth, 1, billion, us, dollars, to, the, palestine, liberation, organization, which, thus, had, a, budget, that, exceeded, that, of, many, third, world, nations, on, november, 8, 1973, kissinger, became, the, first, secretary, of, state, to, meet, with, a, saudi, leader, since, 1953, as, he, met, king, faisal, to, ask, him, to, end, the, embargo, within, two, week, of, the, embargo, being, launched, all, of, the, foreign, ministers, of, the, nations, of, the, european, economic, community, now, the, european, union, met, in, a, conference, to, issue, a, statement, calling, for, israel, to, end, the, territorial, occupation, which, has, maintained, since, the, conflict, of, 1967, on, december, 11, 1973, the, japanese, foreign, minister, masayoshi, hira, flew, in, to, riyadh, to, meet, king, faisal, for, talks, on, improving, bilateral, relations, shortly, afterwards, the, french, foreign, minister, michel, jobert, arrived, to, sign, an, agreement, that, provided, oil, for, france, for, the, next, twenty, years, on, january, 24, 1974, as, the, shah, of, iran, mohammad, reza, pahlavi, was, coming, off, the, ski, slopes, of, st, moritz, he, was, met, by, the, british, chancellor, of, exchequer, anthony, barber, and, the, trade, secretary, peter, walker, in, a, role, reversal, barber, and, walker, paid, homage, to, the, shah, who, promised, them, that, his, nation, would, sell, the, united, kingdom, 5, million, tons, of, oil, in, exchange, for, some, 100, million, of, british, goods, to, aid, his, plans, to, industrialize, iran, saudi, arabia, experienced, an, upsurge, of, prosperity, and, affluence, after, the, oil, embargo, whose, consequences, horrified, king, faisal, faisal, who, was, devoted, to, a, harsh, puritanical, strain, of, sunni, islam, known, in, the, west, as, wahhabism, was, appalled, by, the, way, that, his, subjects, became, materialistic, devoted, only, to, conspicuous, consumption, and, greed, as, they, lost, interest, in, islam, lacey, wrote, the, spiritual, dangers, of, easy, affluence, distressed, him, more, his, simple, gesture, of, piety, and, honor, seemed, to, have, opened, a, pandora, s, box, that, threatened, to, turn, his, realm, into, a, parody, of, all, he, held, dear, in, the, last, two, of, years, of, his, life, faisal, fell, into, depression, over, the, way, his, subjects, had, been, seduced, into, a, consumerist, lifestyle, becoming, lost, in, a, sense, of, melancholia, faisal, s, son, crown, prince, mohammad, told, lacey, in, 1981, the, profligacy, the, greed, he, felt, he, could, not, stem, it, he, become, so, bound, up, in, his, work, there, was, almost, nothing, private, of, him, left, a, sign, of, the, changed, values, was, that, despite, the, total, ban, on, alcohol, in, saudi, arabia, that, drinking, along, with, drug, use, become, common, with, the, younger, members, of, the, house, of, saud, james, akins, the, american, ambassador, in, riyadh, reported, the, sky, over, riyadh, is, black, with, vultures, with, new, get, richer, quicker, plans, under, their, wings, in, 1974, property, prices, in, riyadh, doubled, on, a, weekly, basis, for, the, entire, year, as, the, prosperity, led, to, a, real, estate, speculation, bubble, that, was, often, compared, to, the, klondike, gold, rush, of, 1898, 1899, at, the, red, sea, port, of, jeddah, there, were, so, many, ships, queuing, up, laden, with, cement, for, the, construction, boom, in, saudi, arabia, that, construction, contractors, hired, helicopters, to, fly, the, cement, in, twenty, bags, per, flight, a, number, of, families, engaged, in, the, saudi, construction, industry, such, as, the, juffali, alireza, al, khasshoggi, and, the, bin, laden, families, all, become, very, wealthy, as, a, result, of, the, construction, boom, the, period, after, the, oil, shock, of, 1973, 1974, is, still, fondly, remembered, in, saudi, arabia, as, the, age, of, abundance, where, nearly, everyone, had, a, significant, increase, in, their, standard, of, living, the, wealth, and, corruption, generated, by, the, oil, shock, led, to, a, fundamentalist, backlash, in, saudi, arabia, on, 20, november, 1979, islam, s, most, holiest, shrine, the, grand, mosque, of, mecca, was, seized, by, a, group, of, fanatics, who, proclaimed, themselves, to, be, the, followers, of, the, mahdi, a, messianic, figure, said, to, appear, at, the, dawn, of, every, muslim, century, to, strike, down, the, enemies, of, islam, the, leader, of, the, uprising, juhayman, al, otaybi, read, out, a, list, of, grievances, as, he, accused, the, house, of, saud, of, being, corrupt, and, degenerate, as,

none, had, existed, previously, the, lower, oil, prices, of, the, 1980s, along, with, cutbacks, and, the, belief, that, the, fln, regime, was, corrupt, helped, cause, the, riots, of, october, 1988, against, the, fln, regime, that, killed, at, least, 500, people, the, riots, were, largely, caused, by, the, fact, that, the, low, oil, prices, had, forced, the, algerian, state, to, end, many, of, its, more, generous, social, policies, between, 1986, and, 1988, leading, to, an, unemployment, rate, of, 30, by, 1988, along, with, the, knowledge, that, the, fln, regime, had, stolen, millions, in, the, aftermath, of, the, october, riots, president, chadli, bendjedid, began, a, transition, to, democracy, the, first, free, elections, in, algeria, in, january, 1992, were, won, by, the, islamist,

the, great, depression, to, have, a, persistent, effect, on, the, us, economy, the, embargo, had, a, negative, influence, on, the, us, economy, by, causing, immediate, demands, to, address, the,

to, make, the, united, states, self, sufficient, in, energy, by, 1980, which, called, for, a, massive, investment, in, the, nuclear, industry, nixon, seems, to, have, assumed, that, nuclear, energy, was, economical, and, was, encouraged, by, the, faddish, enthusiasm, of, many, officials, who, more, on, the, basis, of, faith, than, rationality, saw, nuclear, energy, as, the, technology, of, the, future, by, the, late, 1960s, a, lively, environmentalist, movement, had, emerged, in, the, united, states, and, the, project, independence, nuclear, program, was, the, subject, of, much, debate, in, both, the, media, and, congress, the, ensuing, debates, revealed, that, many, of, the, claims, made, for, nuclear, power, vast, underestimated, the, true, costs, of, nuclear, reactors, equally, problematic, was, the, troublesome, issue, of, where, to, safety, store, the, spent, nuclear, rods, that, emitted, a, toxic, level, of, radioactivity, for, centuries, afterward, in, an, cost, effective, manner, the, issue, of, the, spent, nuclear, rods, was, especially, difficult, because, in, a, classic, case, of, nimbyism, communities, proved, very, unwilling, to, accept, a, storage, place, for, the, inevitable, by, product, of, nuclear, power, the, spent, nuclear, rods, with, the, demand, being, made, that, the, government, find, some, other, community, to, store, the, rods, many, of, the, nuclear, reactors, ordered, in, 1973, were, cancelled, due, to, the, horrendous, cost, overruns, while, over, 100, nuclear, plants, were, shut, down, as, uneconomical, over, the, next, 10, years, unlike, nations, that, tried, to, use, nuclear, power, as, a, way, for, energy, independence, such, as, france, and, sweden, the, united, states, had, substantial, reserves, of, its, own, oil, which, weakened, the, case, for, nuclear, power, in, the, ensuring, debates, by, 1989, only, 18, of, american, energy, came, from, nuclear, power, plants, which, was, a, faction, of, what, project, independence, had, envisioned, in, 1973, the, oil, shock, led, to, anti, arab, feelings, becoming, common, cartoons, published, in, american, newspapers, during, the, oil, shock, depicted, arabs, as, disgusting, ugly, obese, corrupt, and, greedy, in, the, cartoons, the, long, hooked, semitic, noses, that, had, traditionally, been, featured, in, anti, jewish, cartoons, were, applied, to, the, arab, sheiks, as, a, way, to, illustrate, their, supposed, greed, american, public, opinion, did, not, see, the, use, of, the, oil, weapon, as, due, to, politics, and, tended, to, explain, the, embargo, as, only, due, to, the, excessive, greed, of, king, faisal, and, the, other, arab, leaders, hence, the, use, of, the, hooked, semitic, nose, in, the, cartoons, as, a, sort, of, shorthand, for, insatiable, greed, the, soviet, union, was, not, a, beneficiary, of, the, oil, crisis, the, crisis, prompted, the, ussr, to, raise, energy, prices, within, the, council, on, mutual, economic, assistance, cmea, the, inability, of, the, ussr, to, meet, energy, demand, from, its, allies, led, those, east, european, governments, to, purchase, oil, from, middle, eastern, countries, at, increasing, world, market, prices, crippling, their, balance, of, payments, and, accentuating, their, other, economic, shortcomings, the, embargo, was, not, uniform, across, western, europe, in, 1969, france, devalued, the, franc, the, devalued, franc, made, exports, more, expensive, for, french, consumers, which, encouraged, them, to, buy, french, while, making, french, more, cheaper, abroad, france, was, entirely, dependent, upon, imported, oil, through, french, companies, continued, to, lease, the, oil, concessions, in, algeria, until, 1971, the, low, price, of, oil, internationally, compensated, to, a, certain, extent, for, the, higher, price, of, oil, caused, by, the, devaluation, the, devalued, franc, ensured, that, the, dramatic, price, increases, caused, by, the, oil, shock,

netherlands, faced, a, complete, embargo, by, contrast, britain, and, france, received, almost, uninterrupted, supplies, that, was, their, reward, for, refusing, to, allow, the, us, to, use, their, airfields, and, stopping, arms, and, supplies, to, both, the, arabs, and, the, israelis, the, other, six, eec, nations, faced, partial, cutbacks, the, uk, had, traditionally, been, an, ally, of, israel, and, harold, wilson, s, government, supported, the, israelis, during, the, six, day, war, his, successor, ted, heath, reversed, this, policy, in, 1970, calling, for, israel, to, withdraw, to, its, pre, 1967, borders, the, eec, was, unable, to, achieve, a, common, policy, during, the, first, month, of, the, embargo, it, issued, a, statement, on, november, 6, after, the, embargo, and, price, rises, had, begun, it, was, widely, viewed, as, pro, arab, supporting, the, franco, british, line, on, the, war, opec, duly, lifted, its, embargo, from, all, eec, members, the, other, european, states, did, not, rally, in, defense, of, the, dutch, who, were, left, to, fend, for, themselves, and, instead, reached, bilateral, deals, with, saudi, arabia, iraq, and, iran, faced, with, a, recession, there, was, a, tendency, within, the, eec, nations, to, turn, inwards, away, from, european, integration, the, price, rises, had, a, much, greater, impact, in, europe, than, the, embargo, the, crisis, retarded, the, movement, towards, european, economic, integration, which, had, been, gathering, pace, ever, since, the, eec, now, the, european, union, had, been, founded, in, 1957, the, german, historian, jens, uwe, wunderlich, wrote, that, in, 1973, attempts, to, finish, off, the, european, common, market, came, to, a, complete, standstill, in, 1973, and, it, was, not, until, 1977, that, movement, towards, creating, the, common, market, resumed, as, the, eec, s, customs, union, had, made, it, impossible, to, raise, tariffs, against, other, eec, members, there, was, a, tendency, especially, pronounced, in, france, and, the, united, kingdom, for, governments, to, subside, national, champions, with, selected, corporations, receiving, grants, and, tax, breaks, as, a, response, to, the, crisis, in, particular, the, oil, shock, increased, the, appeal, of, nuclear, energy, as, a, way, to, achieve, energy, independence, from, the, turbulent, middle, east, starting, in, march, 1974, with, the, energy, plan, introduced, by, the, premier, pierre, messmer, the, french, state, made, a, massive, investment, in, nuclear, energy, and, by, the, 1990s, 80, of, all, of, france, s, energy, came, from, nuclear, plants, the, north, sea, oil, fields, which, were, discovered, in, 1969, did, not, start, to, be, exploited, until, 1975, making, the, united, kingdom, entirely, dependent, upon, imported, oil, in, 1973, the, way, that, world, oil, prices, quadrupled, in, late, 1973, had, a, very, adverse, impact, on, the, british, economy, in, a, series, of, speeches, in, december, 1973, the, prime, minister, edward, heath, warned, that, because, of, the, oil, shock, that, the, british, economy, was, going, into, recession, and, the, british, people, should, expect, economic, austerity, the, need, to, avoid, importing, the, now, more, expensive, oil, to, help, manage, the, balance, of, payments, led, the, heath, government, to, turn, towards, coal, which, britain, was, self, sufficient, in, as, a, substitute, source, of, energy, which, gave, the, coal, miners, union, immense, leverage, over, the, government, to, press, for, higher, wages, for, the, coal, miners, heath, offered, the, coal, miners, a, 7, wage, increase, which, was, rejected, as, insufficient, by, the, miners, who, went, on, strike, through, not, subjected, to, the, embargo, the, uk, nonetheless, faced, an, energy, crisis, of, its, own, a, series, of, strikes, by, coal, miners, and, railroad, workers, over, the, winter, of, 1973, 74, became, a, major, factor, in, the, defeat, of, heath, s, conservative, government, in, february, 1974, general, elections, the, new, labour, government, told, the, british, to, heat, only, one, room, in, their, houses, over, the, winter, the,

east, it, had, a, stockpile, good, for, 55, days, and, another, 20, day, supply, was, en, route, facing, its, most, serious, crisis, since, 1945, the, government, ordered, a, 10, cut, in, the, consumption, of, industrial, oil, and, electricity, in, december, it, ordered, an, immediate, 20, cut, in, oil, use, and, electric, power, to, japan, s, major, industries, and, cutbacks, in, leisure,

promising, energy, assistance, if, japan, renounced, its, claim, to, the, kurile, islands, tokyo, refused, instead, it, made, 3, 3, billion, of, dollars, in, loans, to, the, arab, states, and, called, on, israel, to, step, back, japan, s, defensive, strategy, was, explained, to, kissinger, when, he, met, with, top, leaders, in, tokyo, in, november, 1973, in, the, long, run, japan, never, wavered, in, its, determination, to, maintain, very, strong, close, ties, to, the, united, states, while, in, self, defense, briefly, providing, the, arab, powers, with, the, rhetoric, they, demanded, in,

the, poor, state, of, the, indian, economy, and, played, a, role, in, indira, gandhi, s, decision, to, impose, the, emergency, a, dictatorship, the, state, led, a, push, for, coal, as, an, energy, source, even, though, there, were, reservations, about, its, adverse, environmental, effects, the, oil, shock, destroyed, the, economy, of, south, vietnam, a, spokesman, for, president, nguy, n, v, n, thi, u, admitted, in, a, tv, interview, that, the, government, was, being, overwhelmed, by, the, inflation, caused, by, the, oil, shock, while, an, american, businessman, living, in, saigon, stated, after, the, oil, shock, that, attempting, to, make, money, in, south, vietnam, was, like, making, love, to, a, corpse, in, december, 1973, vietcong, sappers, attacked, and, destroyed, the, petroleum, depot, of, nha, be, further, depleting, fuel, sources, by, the, summer, of, 1974, the, u, s, embassy, in, saigon, reported, that, morale, in, the, arvn, army, of, the, republic, of, vietnam, had, fallen, to, dangerously, low, levels, and, it, was, uncertain, how, much, more, longer, south, vietnam, would, last, as, inflation, eroded, the, value, of, the, south, vietnamese, ng, it, became, common, by, the, summer, of, 1974, to, see, arvn, soldiers, and, their, families, begging, in, the, streets, for, food, in, december, 1974, the, north, vietnamese, pavn, people, s, army, of, vietnam, launched, an, offensive, in, the, central, highlands, which, far, more, successful, than, expected, as, the, arvn, which, was, suffering, from, low, morale, put, up, a, feeble, resistance, on, march, 1, 1975, the, pavn, launched, a, major, offensive, that, saw, them, quickly, overrun, the, central, highlands, and, by, march, 25, 1975, hue, had, fallen, following, their, victory, in, the, central, highlands, the, north, vietnamese, launched, the, ho, chi, minh, campaign, that, saw, saigon, fall, on, april, 30, 1975, three, of, the, nations, targeted, by, the, embargo, were, located, in, southern, africa, or, had, colonies, there, portugal, which, ruled, the, colonies, of, angola, portuguese, guiana, modern, guinea, bissau, and, portuguese, east, africa, modern, mozambique, had, fighting, colonial, wars, in, all, of, its, african, colonies, since, the, 1960s, with, angola, being, the, first, to, rise, up, in, 1961, angola, is, rich, in, oil, which, protected, portugal, from, the, worse, of, the, embargo, but, the, economic, stability, of, the, estado, novo, regime, was, damaged, by, the, worldwide, inflation, which, help, cause, the, carnation, revolution, which, toppled, the, estado, novo, regime, in, april, 1974, and, led, to, the, restoration, of, democracy, portugal, granted, independence, to, all, of, its, colonies, except, for, macau, in, 1975, the, british, historian, rob, skinner, wrote, the, embargo, had, a, significant, impact, on, the, south, african, economy, the, inflationary, rise, in, commodity, prices, increased, the, input, costs, of, south, african, manufacturing, making, south, african, manufactured, goods, uncompetitive, on, the, world, market, the, rise, in, the, price, of, gold, as, a, hedge, against, inflation, south, africa, has, the, world, s, largest, gold, mines, caused, the, rand, to, increase, in, value, which, caused, further, problems, for, south, african, manufacturing, the, strategy, pursued, by, the, national, party, government, since, 1948, of, sponsoring, the, industrialization, of, south, africa, was, derailed, by, the, oil, shock, with, what, skinner, described, as, important, social, and, political, consequences, for, the, apartheid, regime, the, soweto, uprising, of, 1976, was, at, least, in, part, caused, by, anger, at, the, high, unemployment, rate, in, black, south, african, community, even, worse, hit, than, south, africa, was, rhodesia, modern, zimbabwe, where, oil, was, already, expensive, as, the, white, supremacist, government, of, rhodesia, had, been, under, united, nations, sanctions, since, 1965, and, thus, the, smugglers, who, sold, rhodesia, oil, charged, a, premium, for, their, services, the, premium, charged, by, the, sanctions, busters, such, as, iran, increased, after, the, embargo, which, threw, the, rhodesian, economy, into, recession, despite, the, united, nations, sanctions, rhodesia, was, a, major, exporter, of, chrome, steel, and, tobacco, with, the, united, states, exempting, strategical, rhodesian, products, such, as, chrome, from, the, sanctions, the, global, recession, of, 1973, 1975, proved, more, effective, than, the, united, nations, in, ending, the, global, demand, for, rhodesian, products, which, made, the, rhodesian, recession, especially, severe, unlike, south, africa, which, had, a, sizable, and, long, standing, white, population, the, white, population, of, rhodesia, was, much, smaller, and, more, recent, rhodesia, depended, considerably, more, than, south, africa, on, white, immigration, to, provide, enough, soldiers, for, its, army, while, most, of, the, rhodesian, whites, had, only, arrived, in, the, 1950s, and, did, not, have, very, deep, roots, in, the, country, the, white, flight, caused, by, the, recession, put, the, rhodesian, army, at, a, major, disadvantage, in, its, war, against, the, black, guerrillas, the, war, costed, the, rhodesian, government, one, million, rhodesian, dollars, per, day, by, 1975, and, the, costs, of, the, war, threatened, to, bankrupt, rhodesia, in, 1979, rhodesia, signed, the, lancaster, house, agreement, which, led, to, majority, rule, in, 1980, price, controls, exacerbated, the, crisis, in, the, us, the, system, limited, the, price, of, old, oil, that, which, had, already, been, discovered, while, allowing, newly, discovered, oil, to, be, sold, at, a, higher, price, to, encourage, investment, predictably, old, oil, was, withdrawn, from, the, market, creating, greater, scarcity, the, rule, also, discouraged, development, of, alternative, energies, the, rule, had, been, intended, to, promote, oil, exploration, scarcity, was, addressed, by, rationing, as, in, many, countries, motorists, faced, long, lines, at, gas, stations, beginning, in, summer, 1972, and, increasing, by, summer, 1973, a, sign, of, the, change, caused, by, the, crisis, was, that, in, 1974, the, exxon, oil, company, which, had, once, been, part, of, the, standard, oil, company, replaced, the, general, motors, corporation, to, be, the, largest, corporation, in, the, world, as, measured, by, gross, sales, revenues, in, 1973, nixon, named, william, e, simon, as, the, first, administrator, of, the, federal, energy, office, a, short, term, organization, created, to, coordinate, the, response, to, the, embargo, simon, allocated, states, the, same, amount, of, domestic, oil, for, 1974, that, each, had, consumed, in, 1972, which, worked, for, states, whose, populations, were, not, increasing, in, other, states, lines, at, gasoline, stations, were, common, the, american, automobile, association, reported, that, in, the, last, week, of, february, 1974, 20, of, american, gasoline, stations, had, no, fuel, odd, even, rationing, allowed, vehicles, with, license, plates, having, an, odd, number, as, the, last, digit, or, a, vanity, license, plate, to, buy, gas, only, on, odd, numbered, days, of, the, month, while, others, could, buy, only, on, even, numbered, days, in, some, states, a, three, color, flag, system, was, used, to, denote, gasoline, availability, at, service, stations, green, for, unrationed, availability, yellow, for, restricted, rationed, sales, and, red, for, out, of, stock, rationing, led, to, violent, incidents, when, truck, drivers, chose, to, strike, for, two, days, in, december, 1973, over, the, limited, supplies, that, simon, had, allocated, for, their, industry, in, pennsylvania, and, ohio, non, striking, truckers, were, shot, at, by, striking, truckers, and, in, arkansas, trucks, of, non, strikers, were, attacked, with, bombs, america, had, controlled, the, price, of, natural, gas, since, the, 1950s, with, the, inflation, of, the, 1970s, the, price, was, too, low, to, encourage, the, search, for, new, reserves, america, s, natural, gas, reserves, dwindled, from, 237, trillion, in, 1974, to, 203, trillion, in, 1978, the, price, controls, were, not, changed, despite, president, gerald, ford, s, repeated, requests, to, congress, to, help, reduce, consumption, in, 1974, a, national, maximum, speed, limit, of, 55, mph, 89, km, h, was, imposed, through, the, emergency, highway, energy, conservation, act,

declassified, documents, revealed, that, the, us, was, so, distraught, by, the, rise, in, oil, prices, and, being, challenged, by, under, developed, countries, that, they, briefly, considered,

rapid, operation, to, seize, oilfields, in, saudi, arabia, and, kuwait, and, possibly, abu, dhabi, if, military, action, was, decided, upon, although, the, soviet, response, to, such, an, act, would, likely, not, involve, force, intelligence, warned, the, american, occupation, would, need, to, last, 10, years, as, the, west, developed, alternative, energy, sources, and, would, result, in, the,

israel, the, percentage, of, us, oil, which, comes, from, the, nations, bordering, the, persian, gulf, remained, steady, over, the, decades, with, a, figure, of, a, little, more, than, 10, in, 2008,

general, augusto, pinochet, toppled, socialist, president, salvador, allende, on, september, 11, 1973, the, response, of, the, nixon, administration, was, to, propose, doubling, arms, sales, as, a,

relationships, between, arab, countries, and, the, us, and, ussr, at, the, time, egypt, syria, and, iraq, were, allied, with, the, ussr, while, saudi, arabia, turkey, and, iran, plus, israel, aligned, with, the, us, vacillations, in, alignment, often, resulted, in, greater, support, from, the, respective, superpowers, when, anwar, sadat, became, president, of, egypt, in, 1970, he, dismissed, soviet, specialists, in, egypt, and, reoriented, towards, the, us, concerns, over, economic, domination, from, increased, soviet, oil, production, turned, into, fears, of, military, aggression, after, the, 1979, soviet, invasion, of, afghanistan, a, major, turning, point, in, cold, war, geopolitics, turning, the, persian, gulf, states, towards, the, us, for, security, guarantees, against, soviet, military, action, also, coming, at, a, time, marked, by, increased, american, weapons, sales, technology, and, outright, military, presence, to, various, us, allied, nations, saudi, arabia, and, iran, became, increasingly, dependent, on, american, security, assurances, to, manage, both, external, and, internal, threats, including, increased, military, competition, between, them, over, increased,

of, islamism, a, reality, which, would, quickly, be, revealed, in, the, grand, mosque, seizure, in, mecca, by, wahhabi, extremists, during, november, 1979, and, a, shiite, muslim, revolt, in, the, oil, rich, al, hasa, region, of, saudi, arabia, in, december, of, the, same, year, which, was, known, as, the, 1979, qatif, uprising, saudi, arabia, is, a, near, absolute, monarchy, an, arabic, speaking, country, and, has, a, sunni, muslim, majority, while, persian, speaking, iran, since, 1979, is, an, islamist, theocracy, with, a, shiite, muslim, majority, which, explains, the, current, hostility, between, saudi, arabia, and, iran, before, the, iranian, revolution, the, usually, pro, american, anti, communist, and, largely, sunni, muslim, saudi, arabians, were, somewhat, wary, of, the, pro, soviet, relations, held, by, the, ba, athist, socialist, and, relatively, secularist, republican, dictatorship, of, iraq, the, latter, of, which, is, a, majority, shiite, muslim, arab, nation, which, was, ruled, by, a, sunni, muslim, arab, minority, before, the, iraq, war, and, how, that, affected, the, saudis, own, relations, with, the, iraqis, because, these, two, oil, rich, arab, nations, share, a, long, land, border, with, each, other, the, oil, crisis, sent, a, signal, to, the, auto, industry, globally, which, changed, many, aspects, of, production, and, usage, for, decades, to, come, after, world, war, ii, most, west, european, countries, taxed, motor, fuel, to, limit, imports, and, as, a, result, most, cars, made, in, europe, were, smaller, and, more, economical, than, their, american, counterparts, by, the, late, 1960s, increasing, incomes, supported, rising, car, sizes, the, oil, crisis, pushed, west, european, car, buyers, away, from, larger, less, economical, cars, the, most, notable, result, of, this, transition, was, the, rise, in, popularity, of, compact, hatchbacks, the, only, notable, small, hatchbacks, built, in, western, europe, before, the, oil, crisis, were, the, peugeot, 104, renault, 5, and, fiat, 127, by, the, end, of, the, decade, the, market, had, expanded, with, the, introduction, of, the, ford, fiesta, opel, kadett, sold, as, the, vauxhall, astra, in, great, britain, chrysler, sunbeam, and, citro, n, visa, buyers, looking, for, larger, cars, were, increasingly, drawn, to, medium, sized, hatchbacks, virtually, unknown, in, europe, in, 1973, by, the, end, of, the, decade, they, were, gradually, replacing, sedans, as, the, mainstay, of, this, sector, between, 1973, and, 1980, medium, sized, hatchbacks, were, launched, across, europe, the, chrysler, simca, horizon, fiat, ritmo, strada, in, the, uk, ford, escort, mk3, renault, 14, volvo, 340, 360, opel, kadett, and, volkswagen, golf, these, cars, were, considerably, more, economical, than, the, traditional, saloons, they, were, replacing, and, attracted, buyers, who, traditionally, bought, larger, vehicles, some, 15, years, after, the, oil, crisis, hatchbacks, dominated, most, european, small, and, medium, car, markets, and, had, gained, a, substantial, share, of, the, large, family, car, market, before, the, energy, crisis, large, heavy, and, powerful,

such, as, the, toyota, corona, mark, ii, the, toyota, cressida, the, mazda, 616, and, datsun, 810, which, added, passenger, space, and, amenities, such, as, air, conditioning, power, steering, am, fm,
