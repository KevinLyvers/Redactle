necessary, or, why, you, feel, the, way, you, do, by, james, thurber, and, e, b, white, has, a, chapter, titled, the, sexual, revolution, being, a, rather, complete, survey, of, the, entire, sexual, scene, according, to, konstantin, dushenko, the, term, was, in, use, in, soviet, russia, in, 1925, when, speaking, of, the, sexual, revolution, historians, make, a, distinction, between, the, first, and, the, second, sexual, revolution, in, the, first, sexual, revolution, 1870, 1910, victorian, morality, lost, its, universal, appeal, however, it, did, not, lead, to, the, rise, of, a, permissive, society, exemplary, for, this, period, is, the, rise, and, differentiation, in, forms, of, regulating, sexuality, classics, professor, kyle, harper, uses, the, phrase, first, sexual, revolution, to, refer, to, the, displacement, of, the, norms, of, sexuality, in, ancient, rome, with, those, of, christianity, as, it, was, adopted, throughout, the, roman, empire, romans, accepted, and, legalized, prostitution, bisexuality, and, pederasty, male, promiscuity, was, considered, normal, and, healthy, as, long, as, masculinity, was, maintained, associated, with, being, the, penetrating, partner, in, contrast, female, chastity, was, required, for, respectable, women, to, ensure, the, integrity, of, family, bloodlines, these, attitudes, were, replaced, by, christian, prohibitions, on, homosexual, acts, and, any, sex, outside, marriage, including, with, slaves, and, prostitutes, history, professor, faramerz, dabhoiwala, cites, the, age, of, enlightenment, approximately, the, 18th, century, as, a, major, period, of, transition, in, the, united, kingdom, during, this, time, the, philosophy, of, liberalism, developed, and, was, popularized, and, migration, to, cities, increased, opportunities, for, sex, and, made, enforcement, of, rules, more, difficult, than, in, small, villages, sexual, misconduct, in, the, catholic, church, undermined, the, credibility, of, religious, authorities, and, the, rise, of, urban, police, forces, helped, distinguish, crime, from, sin, overall, toleration, increased, for, heterosexual, sex, outside, marriage, including, prostitution, mistresses, and, pre, marital, sex, though, these, acts, were, still, condemned, by, many, as, libertine, infidelity, became, more, often, a, civil, matter, than, a, criminal, offense, receiving, capital, punishment, masturbation, homosexuality, and, rape, were, generally, less, tolerated, women, went, from, being, considered, as, lustful, as, men, to, passive, partners, whose, purity, was, important, to, reputation, commentators, such, as, history, professor, kevin, f, white, have, used, the, phrase, first, sexual, revolution, to, refer, to, the, roaring, twenties, victorian, era, attitudes, were, somewhat, destabilized, by, world, war, i, and, alcohol, prohibition, in, the, united, states, at, the, same, time, the, women, s, suffrage, movement, obtained, voting, rights, the, subculture, of, the, flapper, girl, included, pre, marital, sex, and, petting, parties, indicators, of, non, traditional, sexual, behavior, e, g, gonorrhea, incidence, births, out, of, wedlock, and, births, to, teenagers, began, to, rise, dramatically, in, the, mid, to, late, 1950s, it, brought, about, profound, shifts, in, attitudes, toward, women, s, sexuality, homosexuality, pre, marital, sexuality, and, the, freedom, of, sexual, expression, psychologists, and, scientists, such, as, wilhelm, reich, and, alfred, kinsey, influenced, the, changes, as, well, changing, mores, were, both, stimulated, by, and, reflected, in, literature, and, films, and, by, the, social, movements, of, the, period, including, the, counterculture, the, women, s, movement, and, the, gay, rights, movement, the, counterculture, contributed, to, the, awareness, of, radical, cultural, change, that, was, the, social, matrix, of, the, sexual, revolution, the, sexual, revolution, was, initiated, by, those, who, shared, a, belief, in, the, detrimental, impact, of, sexual, repression, a, view, that, had, previously, been, argued, by, wilhelm, reich, d, h, lawrence, sigmund, freud, and, the, surrealist, movement, the, counterculture, wanted, to, explore, the, body, and, mind, and, free, the, personal, self, from, the, moral, and, legal, sexual, confines, of, modern, america, as, well, as, from, the, 1940s, 50s, morals, in, general, the, sexual, revolution, of, the, 1960s, grew, from, a, conviction, that, the, erotic, should, be, celebrated, as, a, normal, part, of, life, and, not, repressed, by, family, industrialized, sexual, morality, religion, and, the, state, the, development, of, the, birth, control, pill, in, 1960, gave, women, access, to, easy, and, more, reliable, contraception, another, likely, cause, was, a, vast, improvement, in, obstetrics, greatly, reducing, the, number, of, women, who, died, due, to, childbearing, thus, increasing, the, life, expectancy, of, women, a, third, more, indirect, cause, was, the, large, number, of, children, born, in, the, 1940s, and, throughout, the, 1950s, all, over, the, western, world, the, baby, boom, generation, many, of, whom, would, grow, up, in, relatively, prosperous, and, safe, conditions, within, a, middle, class, on, the, rise, and, with, better, access, to, education, and, entertainment, than, ever, before, by, their, demographic, weight, and, their, social, and, educational, background, they, came, to, trigger, a, shift, in, society, towards, more, permissive, and, informalized, attitudes, the, discovery, of, penicillin, led, to, significant, reductions, in, syphilis, mortality, which, in, turn, spurred, an, increase, in, non, traditional, sex, during, the, mid, to, late, 1950s, there, was, an, increase, in, sexual, encounters, between, unmarried, adults, divorce, rates, were, dramatically, increasing, and, marriage, rates, were, significantly, decreasing, in, this, time, period, the, number, of, unmarried, americans, aged, twenty, to, twenty, four, more, than, doubled, from, 4, 3, million, in, 1960, to, 9, 7, million, in, 1976, men, and, women, sought, to, reshape, marriage, by, instilling, new, institutions, of, open, marriage, mate, swapping, swinging, and, communal, sex, sigmund, freud, of, vienna, believed, human, behavior, was, motivated, by, unconscious, drives, primarily, by, the, libido, or, sexual, energy, freud, proposed, to, study, how, these, unconscious, drives, were, repressed, and, found, expression, through, other, cultural, outlets, he, called, this, therapy, psychoanalysis, while, freud, s, ideas, were, sometimes, ignored, or, provoked, resistance, within, viennese, society, his, ideas, soon, entered, the, discussions, and, working, methods, of, anthropologists, artists, and, writers, all, over, europe, and, from, the, 1920s, in, the, united, states, his, conception, of, a, primary, sexual, drive, that, would, not, be, ultimately, curbed, by, law, education, or, standards, of, decorum, spelled, a, serious, challenge, to, victorian, prudishness, and, his, theory, of, psychosexual, development, proposed, a, model, for, the, development, of, sexual, orientations, and, desires, children, emerged, from, the, oedipus, complex, a, sexual, desire, towards, their, parent, of, the, opposite, sex, the, idea, of, children, having, their, parents, as, their, early, sexual, targets, was, particularly, shocking, to, victorian, and, early, 20th, century, society, according, to, freud, s, theory, in, the, earliest, stage, of, a, child, s, psychosexual, development, the, oral, stage, the, mother, s, breast, became, the, formative, source, of, all, later, erotic, sensation, much, of, his, research, remains, widely, contested, by, professionals, in, the, field, though, it, has, spurred, critical, developments, in, the, humanities, two, anarchist, and, marxist, proponents, of, freud, otto, gross, and, wilhelm, reich, who, famously, coined, the, phrase, sexual, revolution, developed, a, sociology, of, sex, in, the, 1910s, through, the, 1930s, in, which, the, animal, like, competitive, reproductive, behavior, was, seen, as, a, legacy, of, ancestral, human, evolution, reflecting, in, every, social, relation, as, per, the, freudian, interpretation, hence, the, liberation, of, sexual, behavior, was, considered, by, them, to, be, a, means, to, social, revolution, the, 1928, publication, of, anthropologist, margaret, mead, s, coming, of, age, in, samoa, brought, the, sexual, revolution, to, the, public, scene, as, her, thoughts, concerning, sexual, freedom, pervaded, academia, mead, s, ethnography, focused, on, the, psychosexual, development, of, adolescents, in, samoa, she, recorded, that, their, adolescence, was, not, in, fact, a, time, of, storm, and, stress, as, erikson, s, stages, of, development, suggest, but, that, the, sexual, freedom, experienced, by, the, adolescents, actually, permitted, them, an, easy, transition, from, childhood, to, adulthood, mead, s, findings, were, later, criticized, by, anthropologist, derek, freeman, who, investigated, her, claims, of, promiscuity, and, conducted, his, own, ethnography, of, samoan, society, sex, and, culture, is, a, 1934, book, by, english, social, anthropologist, j, d, unwin, concerning, the, correlation, between, a, society, s, level, of, cultural, achievement, and, its, level, of, sexual, restraint, the, book, concluded, with, the, theory, that, as, societies, develop, they, become, more, sexually, liberal, accelerating, the, social, entropy, of, the, society, thereby, diminishing, its, creative, and, expansive, energy, in, the, late, 1940s, and, early, 1950s, alfred, c, kinsey, published, two, surveys, of, modern, sexual, behavior, in, 1948, kinsey, published, the, book, sexual, behavior, in, the, human, male, he, followed, this, five, years, later, with, sexual, behavior, in, the, human, female, these, books, began, a, revolution, in, social, awareness, of, and, public, attention, given, to, human, sexuality, kinsey, based, his, findings, in, both, these, books, on, interviews, that, he, and, his, team, of, researchers, conducted, with, thousands, of, americans, beginning, in, the, 1930s, the, interviews, were, extensive, and, could, last, for, several, hours, they, were, supplemented, by, diaries, and, other, documents, that, the, interviewees, were, willing, to, have, copied, and, sometimes, film, of, them, masturbation, or, having, sex, with, others, if, they, volunteered, and, it, was, practical, kinsey, found, in, the, course, of, these, interviews, that, many, sexual, behaviors, which, had, previously, been, seen, as, marginal, or, abnormal, were, in, fact, more, common, than, previously, recognized, and, were, part, of, the, normal, spectrum, of, human, sexual, behavior, for, instance, he, is, the, source, of, the, widely, quoted, statistic, that, 4, of, the, male, population, is, primarily, homosexual, he, advocated, using, this, information, to, reform, sex, related, laws, which, at, the, time, were, often, draconian, for, example, two, men, having, consensual, sex, in, private, was, considered, a, crime, kinsey, s, books, became, bestsellers, when, published, and, laid, the, groundwork, for, researchers, william, h, masters, and, virginia, e, johnson, to, study, the, nature, and, scope, of, sexual, practices, among, young, americans, their, books, human, sexual, response, and, human, sexual, inadequacy, published, in, 1966, and, 1970, respectively, were, also, best, sellers, and, are, now, considered, classic, texts, in, the, field, in, the, united, states, in, the, years, 1959, through, 1966, bans, on, three, books, with, explicit, erotic, content, were, challenged, and, overturned, this, also, occurred, in, the, united, kingdom, starting, with, the, 1959, obscene, publications, act, and, reaching, a, peak, with, the, lady, chatterley, s, lover, court, case, prior, to, this, time, a, patchwork, of, regulations, as, well, as, local, customs, and, vigilante, actions, governed, what, could, and, could, not, be,

amendment, by, permitting, the, publication, of, fanny, hill, the, u, s, supreme, court, set, the, bar, for, any, ban, so, high, that, rembar, himself, called, the, 1966, decision, the, end, of, obscenity, only, books, primarily, appealing, to, prurient, interest, could, be, banned, in, a, famous, phrase, the, court, said, that, obscenity, is, utterly, without, redeeming, social, importance, meaning, that, a, work, with, any, redeeming, social, importance, or, literary, merit, was, arguably, not, obscene, even, if, it, contained, isolated, passages, that, could, deprave, and, corrupt, some, readers, swedish, filmmakers, like, ingmar, bergman, and, vilgot, sj, man, contributed, to, sexual, liberation, with, sexually, themed, films, that, challenged, conservative, international,

of, the, modernization, process, that, by, breaking, down, traditional, borders, would, lead, to, the, emancipation, of, natural, forces, and, desires, in, sweden, and, nearby, countries, at, the, time, these, films, by, virtue, of, being, made, by, directors, who, had, established, themselves, as, leading, names, in, their, generation, helped, delegitimize, the, idea, of, habitually, demanding, that, films, should, avoid, overtly, sexual, subject, matter, the, films, eventually, progressed, the, public, s, attitude, toward, sex, especially, in, sweden, and, other, northern,

manufacture, and, production, of, rubber, made, possible, the, design, and, production, of, condoms, that, could, be, used, by, hundreds, of, millions, of, men, and, women, to, prevent, pregnancy, at, little, cost, advances, in, chemistry, pharmacology, and, biology, and, human, physiology, led, to, the, discovery, and, perfection, of, the, first, oral, contraceptives, popularly, known, as, the, pill, all, these, developments, took, place, alongside, and, combined, with, an, increase, in, the, world, literacy, and, a, decline, in, religious, observance, old, values, such, as, the, biblical, notion, of, be, fruitful, and, multiply, were, cast, aside, as, people, continued, to, feel, alienated, from, the, past, and, adopted, the, lifestyles, of, progressive, modernizing, cultures, another, contribution, that, helped, bring, about, this, modern, revolution, of, sexual, freedom, were, the, writings, of, herbert, marcuse, and, wilhelm, reich, who, took, the, philosophy, of, karl, marx, and, similar, philosophers, no, fault, unilateral, divorce, became, legal, and, easier, to, obtain, in, many, countries, during, the, 1960s, 1970s, and, 1980s, the, women, s, movement, redefined, sexuality, not, in, terms, of, simply, pleasing, men, but, recognizing, women, s, sexual, satisfaction, and, sexual, desire, the, myth, of, the, vaginal, orgasm, 1970, by, anne, koedt, illustrates, an, understanding, of, a, women, s, sexual, anatomy, including, evidence, for, the, clitoral, orgasm, arguing, against, freud, s, assumptions, of, women, as, inferior, appendage, to, man, and, her, consequent, social, and, psychological, role, the, women, s, movement, was, able, to, develop, lesbian, feminism, freedom, from, heterosexual, act, and, freedom, from, reproduction, feminist, betty, friedan, published, the, feminine, mystique, in, 1963, concerning, the, many, frustrations, women, had, with, their, lives, and, with, separate, spheres, which, established, a, pattern, of, inequality, the, gay, rights, movement, started, when, the, stonewall, riots, of, 1969, crystallized, a, broad, grass, roots, mobilization, new, gay, liberationist, gave, political, meaning, to, coming, out, by, extending, the, psychological, personal, process, into, public, life, during, the, 1950s, the, most, feared, thing, of, the, homosexual, culture, was, coming, out, the, homosexual, culture, of, the, 1950s, did, everything, they, could, to, help, keep, their, sexuality, a, secret, from, the, public, and, everyone, else, in, their, lives, but, alfred, kinsey, s, research, on, homosexuality, alleged, that, 39, of, the, unmarried, male, population, had, had, at, least, one, homosexual, experience, to, orgasm, between, adolescence, and, old, age, since, the, beginning, of, the, sexual, liberation, movement, in, the, western, world, which, coincided, with, second, wave, feminism, and, the, women, s, liberation, movement, initiated, in, the, early, 1960s, new, religious, movements, and, alternative, spiritualities, such, as, modern, paganism, and, the, new, age, began, to, grow, and, spread, across, the, globe, alongside, their, intersection, with, the, sexual, liberation, movement, and, the, counterculture, of, the, 1960s, and, exhibited, characteristic, features, such, as, the, embrace, of, alternative, lifestyles, unconventional, dress, rejection, of, abrahamic, religions, and, their, conservative, social, mores, use, of, cannabis, and, other, recreational, drugs, relaxed, attitude, sarcastic, humble, or, self, imposed, poverty, and, laissez, faire, sexual, behavior, the, sexual, liberation, movement, was, aided, by, feminist, ideologues, in, their, mutual, struggle, to, challenge, traditional, ideas, regarding, female, sexuality, male, sexuality, and, queer, sexuality, elimination, of, undue, favorable, bias, towards, men, and, objectification, of, women, as, well, as, support, for, women, s, right, to, choose, their, sexual, partners, free, of, outside, interference, or, societal, judgment, were, three, of, the, main, goals, associated, with, sexual, liberation, from, the, feminist, perspective, since, during, the, early, stages, of, feminism, women, s, liberation, was, often, equated, with, sexual, liberation, rather, than, associated, with, it, many, feminist, thinkers, believed, that, assertion, of, the, primacy, of, sexuality, would, be, a, major, step, towards, the, ultimate, goal, of, women, s, liberation, thus, women, were, urged, to, initiate, sexual, advances, enjoy, sex, and, experiment, with, new, forms, of, sexuality, the, feminist, movements, insisted, and, focused, on, the, sexual, liberation, for, women, both, physical, and, psychological, the, pursuit, of, sexual, pleasure, for, women, was, the, core, ideology, which, subsequently, was, to, set, the, foundation, for, female, independence, although, whether, or, not, sexual, freedom, should, be, a, feminist, issue, is, currently, a, much, debated, topic, the, feminist, movement, overtly, defines, itself, as, the, movement, for, social, political, and, economic, equality, of, men, and, women, feminist, movements, are, also, involved, the, fight, against, sexism, and, since, sexism, is, a, highly, complex, notion, it, is, difficult, to, separate, the, feminist, critique, toward, sexism, from, its, fight, against, sexual, oppression, the, feminist, movement, has, helped, create, a, social, climate, in, which, lgbt, people, and, women, are, increasingly, able, to, be, open, and, free, with, their, sexuality, which, enabled, a, spiritual, liberation, of, sorts, with, regards, to, sex, rather, than, being, forced, to, hide, their, sexual, desires, or, feelings, women, and, lgbt, people, have, gained, and, continue, to, gain, increased, freedom, in, this, area, consequently, the, feminist, movement, to, end, sexual, oppression, has, and, continues, to, directly, contribute, to, the, sexual, liberation, movement, nevertheless, among, many, feminists, the, view, soon, became, widely, held, that, thus, far, the, sexual, freedoms, gained, in, the, sexual, revolution, of, the, 1960s, such, as, the, decreasing, emphasis, on, monogamy, had, been, largely, gained, by, men, at, women, s, expense, in, anticlimax, a, feminist, perspective, on, the, sexual, revolution, sheila, jeffreys, asserted, that, the, sexual, revolution, on, men, s, terms, contributed, less, to, women, s, freedom, than, to, their, continued, oppression, an, assertion, that, has, both, commanded, respect, and, attracted, intense, criticism, in, the, late, 1970s, and, early, 1980s, feminist, sex, wars, broke, out, due, to, disagreements, on, pornography, on, prostitution, and, on, bdsm, as, well, as, sexuality, in, general, as, birth, control, became, widely, accessible, men, and, women, began, to, have, more, choice, in, the, matter, of, having, children, than, ever, before, the, 1916, invention, of, thin, disposable, latex, condoms, for, men, led, to, widespread, affordable, condoms, by, the, 1930s, the, demise, of, the, comstock, laws, in, 1936, set, the, stage, for, the, promotion, of, available, effective, contraceptives, such, as, the, diaphragm, and, cervical, cap, the, 1960s, introduction, of, the, iud, and, oral, contraceptives, for, women, gave, a, sense, of, freedom, from, barrier, contraception, the, catholic, church, under, pope, paul, vi, 1968, published, humanae, vitae, of, human, life, which, was, a, declaration, that, banned, the, use, of, artificial, contraception, churches, allowed, for, the, rhythm, method, which, was, a, method, of, regulating, fertility, that, pushed, men, and, women, to, take, advantage, of, the, natural, cycles, of, female, fertility, during, which, women, were, naturally, infertile, the, opposition, of, churches, e, g, humanae, vitae, led, people, who, felt, alienated, from, or, not, represented, by, religion, to, form, parallel, movements, of, secularization, and, exile, from, religion, women, gained, much, greater, access, to, birth, control, in, the, griswold, girls, world, decision, in, 1965, the, 1965, supreme, court, case, griswold, v, connecticut, ruled, that, the, prohibition, of, contraception, was, unconstitutional, on, the, grounds, that, it, violated, peoples, rights, to, marital, privacy, in, addition, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, the, birth, control, movement, advocated, for, the, legalization, of, abortion, and, large, scale, education, campaigns, about, contraception, by, governments, the, griswold, v, connecticut, case, and, subsequent, birth, control, movements, created, a, precedent, for, later, cases, granting, rights, to, birth, control, for, unmarried, couples, eisenstadt, v, baird, 1972, rights, to, abortion, for, any, woman, roe, v, wade, 1973, and, the, right, to, contraception, for, juveniles, carey, v, population, services, international, 1977, the, griswold, case, was, also, influential, in, and, cited, as, precedent, for, landmark, cases, dealing, with, the, right, to, homosexual, relations, lawrence, v, texas, 2003, and, the, right, to, same, sex, marriage, obergefell, v, hodges, 2015, free, love, is, a, social, movement, that, accepts, all, forms, of, love, the, movement, s, initial, goal, was, to, separate, the, state, from, sexual, matters, such, as, marriage, birth, control, and, adultery, it, stated, that, such, issues, were, the, concern, of, the, people, involved, and, no, one, else, free, love, continued, in, different, forms, throughout, the, 1970s, and, into, the, early, 1980s, but, its, more, assertive, manifestations, faced, increased, pushback, in, the, mid, 1980s, when, the, public, first, became, aware, of, aids, a, deadly, sexually, transmitted, disease, premarital, sex, heavily, stigmatized, for, some, time, became, more, widely, accepted, the, increased, availability, of, birth, control, and, the, legalization, of, abortion, in, some, places, helped, reduce, the, chance, that, pre, marital, sex, would, result, in, unwanted, children, by, the, mid, 1970s, the, majority, of, newly, married, american, couples, had, experienced, sex, before, marriage, central, to, the, change, was, the, development, of, relationships, between, unmarried, adults, which, resulted, in, earlier, sexual, experimentation, reinforced, by, a, later, age, of, marriage, on, average, americans, were, gaining, sexual, experience, before, entering, into, monogamous, relationships, the, increasing, divorce, rate, and, the, decreasing, stigma, attached, to, divorce, during, this, era, also, contributed, to, sexual, experimentation, by, 1971, more, than, 75, of, americans, thought, that, premarital, sex, was, acceptable, a, threefold, increase, from, the, 1950s, and, the, number, of, unmarried, americans, aged, twenty, to, twenty, four, more, than, doubled, from, 1960, to, 1976, americans, were, becoming, less, and, less, interested, in, getting, married, and, settling, down, and, as, well, less, interested, in, monogamous, relationships, in, 1971, 35, of, the, country, said, they, thought, marriage, was, obsolete, the, idea, of, marriage, being, outdated, came, from, the, development, of, casual, sex, between, americans, with, the, development, of, the, birth, control, pill, and, the, legalization,

that, the, sexual, revolution, which, the, west, supposedly, experienced, in, the, late, 1960s, is, a, misconception, misnomer, and, that, sex, is, never, actually, enjoyed, freely, as, such, being, rather, observed, in, all, fields, of, culture, a, stance, adopted, toward, human, behavior, referable, to, the, concept, of, repressive, desublimation, according, to, this, concept, or, interpretation, first, evolved, by, marxist, philosopher, herbert, marcuse, the, sexual, revolution, would, be, an, instance, of, a, conservative, force, masquerading, under, the, guise, of, liberation, a, force, sapping, energies, here, sexual, which, would, otherwise, be, available, for, a, true, social, critique, of, a, given, behavior, and, thus, an, impediment, to, any, real, political, change, which, might, emancipate, the, individual, from, totalitarian, democracy, see, also, bread, and, circuses, false, consciousness, and, frankfurt, school, put, baldly, the, pursuit, of, sexual, freedom, may, be, construed, as, a, distraction, from, the, pursuit, of, actual, freedom, allyn, argues, that, the, sexual, optimism, of, the, 1960s, waned, with, the, economic, crises, of, the, 1970s, the, massive, commercialization, of, sex, increasing, reports, of, child, exploitation, disillusionment, with, the, counter, culture, and, the, new, left, and, a, combined, left,
