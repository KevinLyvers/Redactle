san, stefano, which, had, been, signed, three, months, earlier, the, leader, of, the, congress, german, chancellor, otto, von, bismarck, sought, to, stabilise, the, balkans, reduce, the, role, of, the, defeated, ottoman, empire, in, the, region, and, balance, the, distinct, interests, of, britain, russia, and, austria, hungary, he, also, wanted, to, avoid, domination, of, the, balkans, by, russia, or, the, formation, of, a, greater, bulgaria, and, to, keep, constantinople, in, ottoman, hands, finally, bismarck, wanted, to, encourage, the, development, of, civil, rights, for, jews, in, the, region, the, affected, territories, were, instead, granted, varying, degrees, of, independence, romania, became, fully, independent, though, was, forced, to, give, part, of, bessarabia, to, russia, and, gained, northern, dobruja, serbia, and, montenegro, were, also, granted, full, independence, but, lost, territory, with, austria, hungary, occupying, the, sanjak, of, novi, pazar, along, with, bosnia, and, herzegovina, britain, took, possession, of, cyprus, of, the, territory, that, remained, within, the, ottoman, empire, bulgaria, was, made, a, semi, independent, principality, eastern, rumelia, became, a, special, administration, and, the, region, of, macedonia, was, returned, to, the, ottomans, on, condition, of, reforms, to, its, governance, the, results, were, initially, hailed, as, a, success, for, peace, in, the, region, but, most, of, the, participants, were, not, satisfied, with, the, outcome, the, ottomans, were, humiliated, and, had, their, weakness, confirmed, as, the, sick, man, of, europe, russia, resented, the, lack, of, rewards, despite, having, won, the, war, that, the, conference, was, supposed, to, resolve, and, felt, humiliated, by, the, other, great, powers, in, their, rejection, of, the, san, stefano, settlement, serbia, bulgaria, and, greece, all, received, far, less, than, they, thought, they, deserved, especially, bulgaria, which, was, left, with, less, than, half, of, the, territory, envisioned, by, the, treaty, of, san, stefano, bismarck, became, hated, by, russian, nationalists, and, pan, slavists, and, later, found, that, he, had, tied, germany, too, closely, to, austria, hungary, in, the, balkans, although, austria, hungary, gained, substantial, territory, this, angered, the, south, slavs, and, led, to, decades, of, tensions, in, bosnia, and, herzegovina, culminating, in, the, assassination, of, archduke, franz, ferdinand, in, the, long, term, the, settlement, led, to, rising, tensions, between, russia, and, austria, hungary, and, disputes, over, nationalism, in, the, balkans, grievances, with, the, results, of, the, congress, festered, until, they, exploded, in, the, first, and, second, balkan, wars, 1912, and, 1913, respectively, continuing, nationalism, in, the, balkans, was, one, of, the, causes, of, the, first, world, war, in, 1914, in, the, decades, leading, up, to, the, congress, russia, and, the, balkans, had, been, gripped, by, pan, slavism, a, movement, to, unite, all, the, balkan, slavs, under, one, rule, the, treaty, of, san, stefano, which, had, created, a, greater, bulgaria, was, opposed, as, a, display, of, pan, slavic, hegemonic, ambition, in, southeastern, europe, in, imperial, russia, pan, slavism, meant, the, creation, of, a, unified, slavic, state, under, russian, direction, and, was, essentially, a, byword, for, russian, conquest, of, the, balkan, peninsula, the, realisation, of, the, goal, would, have, given, russia, control, of, the, dardanelles, and, the, bosphorus, thus, economic, control, of, the, black, sea, and, substantially, greater, geopolitical, power, that, desire, evolved, similarly, to, the, pan, germanism, and, pan, italianism, which, had, resulted, in, two, unifications, took, different, forms, in, the, various, slavic, nations, balkan, slavs, felt, they, needed, both, an, equivalent, to, piedmont, to, serve, as, a, base, and, an, outside, sponsor, corresponding, to, france, the, state, that, was, meant, to, serve, as, the, locus, for, unification, of, the, balkans, under, a, slavic, rule, was, not, always, clear, as, initiative, wafted, between, serbia, and, bulgaria, italian, rhetoric, by, contrast, cast, romania, as, latin, a, second, piedmont, the, recognition, of, the, bulgarian, exarchate, by, the, ottomans, in, 1870, had, been, intended, to, separate, the, bulgarians, religiously, from, the, ecumenical, patriarch, of, constantinople, and, politically, from, serbia, pan, slavism, required, the, end, of, ottoman, rule, in, the, balkans, how, and, whether, that, goal, would, be, realised, was, the, major, question, to, be, answered, at, the, congress, of, berlin, the, balkans, were, a, major, stage, for, competition, between, the, european, great, powers, in, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, britain, and, russia, had, interests, in, the, fate, of, the, balkans, russia, was, interested, in, the, region, both, ideologically, as, a, pan, slavist, unifier, and, practically, to, secure, greater, control, of, the, mediterranean, britain, was, interested, in, preventing, russia, from, accomplishing, its, goals, furthermore, the, unifications, of, italy, and, of, germany, had, stymied, the, ability, of, a, third, european, power, austria, hungary, to, expand, its, domain, to, the, southwest, any, further, germany, as, the, most, powerful, continental, nation, since, the, 1871, franco, prussian, war, had, little, direct, interest, in, the, settlement, and, so, was, the, only, power, that, could, mediate, the, balkan, question, credibly, russia, and, austria, hungary, the, two, powers, that, were, most, invested, in, the, fate, of, the, balkans, were, allied, with, germany, in, the, conservative, league, of, three, emperors, which, had, been, founded, to, preserve, the, monarchies, of, continental, europe, the, congress, of, berlin, was, thus, mainly, a, dispute, among, supposed, allies, of, bismarck, and, his, german, empire, the, arbiter, of, the, discussion, would, thus, have, to, choose, before, the, end, of, the, congress, which, of, their, allies, to, support, that, decision, was, to, have, direct, consequences, on, the, future, of, european, geopolitics, ottoman, brutality, in, the, serbian, ottoman, war, and, the, violent, suppression, of, the, herzegovina, uprising, fomented, political, pressure, within, russia, which, saw, itself, as, the, protector, of, the, serbs, to, act, against, the, ottoman, empire, david, mackenzie, wrote, that, sympathy, for, the, serbian, christians, existed, in, court, circles, among, nationalist, diplomats, and, in, the, lower, classes, and, was, actively, expressed, through, the, slav, committees, eventually, russia, sought, and, obtained, austria, hungary, s, pledge, of, benevolent, neutrality, in, the, coming, war, in, return, for, ceding, bosnia, herzegovina, to, austria, hungary, in, the, budapest, convention, of, 1877, act, the, berlin, congress, in, effect, postponed, resolution, of, the, bosnian, question, and, left, bosnia, and, herzegovina, under, habsburg, control, this, was, the, goal, of, austro, hungarian, foreign, minister, count, gyula, andr, ssy, after, the, bulgarian, april, uprising, in, 1876, and, the, russian, victory, in, the, russo, turkish, war, in, 1877, 1878, russia, had, liberated, almost, all, of, the, ottoman, european, possessions, the, ottomans, recognised, montenegro, romania, and, serbia, as, independent, and, the, territories, of, all, three, of, them, were, expanded, russia, created, a, large, principality, of, bulgaria, as, an, autonomous, vassal, of, the, sultan, that, expanded, russia, s, sphere, of, influence, to, encompass, the, entire, balkans, which, alarmed, other, powers, in, europe, britain, which, had, threatened, war, with, russia, if, it, occupied, constantinople, and, france, did, not, want, another, power, meddling, in, either, the, mediterranean, or, the, middle, east, where, both, powers, were, prepared, to, make, large, colonial, gains, austria, hungary, desired, habsburg, control, over, the, balkans, and, germany, wanted, to, prevent, its, ally, from, going, to, war, german, chancellor, otto, von, bismarck, thus, called, the, congress, of, berlin, to, discuss, the, partition, of, the, ottoman, balkans, among, the, european, powers, and, to, preserve, the, league, of, three, emperors, in, the, face, of, the, spread, of, european, liberalism, the, congress, was, attended, by, britain, austria, hungary, france, germany, italy, russia, and, the, ottoman, empire, delegates, from, greece, romania, serbia, and, montenegro, attended, the, sessions, that, concerned, their, states, but, they, were, not, members, the, congress, was, solicited, by, russia, s, rivals, particularly, austria, hungary, and, britain, and, was, hosted, in, 1878, by, bismarck, it, proposed, and, ratified, the, treaty, of, berlin, the, meetings, were, held, at, bismarck, s, reich, chancellery, the, former, radziwill, palace, from, 13, june, to, 13, july, 1878, the, congress, revised, or, eliminated, 18, of, the, 29, articles, in, the, treaty, of, san, stefano, furthermore, by, using, as, a, foundation, the, treaties, of, paris, 1856, and, of, washington, 1871, the, treaty, rearranged, the, east, the, principal, mission, of, the, participants, at, the, congress, was, to, deal, a, fatal, blow, to, the, burgeoning, movement, of, pan, slavism, the, movement, caused, serious, concern, in, berlin, and, even, more, so, in, vienna, which, was, afraid, that, the, repressed, slavic, nationalities, would, revolt, against, the, habsburgs, the, british, and, the, french, governments, were, nervous, about, both, the, diminishing, influence, of, the, ottoman, empire, and, the, cultural, expansion, of, russia, to, the, south, where, both, britain, and, france, were, poised, to, colonise, egypt, and, palestine, by, the, treaty, of, san, stefano, the, russians, led, by, foreign, minister, alexander, gorchakov, had, managed, to, create, in, bulgaria, an, autonomous, principality, under, the, nominal, rule, of, the, ottoman, empire, that, sparked, the, great, game, the, massive, british, fear, of, the, growing, russian, influence, in, the, middle, east, the, new, principality, including, a, very, large, portion, of, macedonia, as, well, as, access, to, the, aegean, sea, could, easily, threaten, the, dardanelles, straits, which, separate, the, black, sea, from, the, mediterranean, sea, the, arrangement, was, not, acceptable, to, the, british, who, considered, the, entire, mediterranean, to, be, a, british, sphere, of, influence, and, saw, any, russian, attempt, to, gain, access, there, as, a, grave, threat, to, british, power, on, 4, june, before, the, congress, opened, on, 13, june, british, prime, minister, lord, beaconsfield, had, already, concluded, the, cyprus, convention, a, secret, alliance, with, the, ottomans, against, russia, in, which, britain, was, allowed, to, occupy, the, strategically, placed, island, of, cyprus, the, agreement, predetermined, beaconsfield, s, position, during, the, congress, and, led, him, to, issue, threats, to, unleash, a, war, against, russia, if, it, did, not, comply, with, ottoman, demands, negotiations, between, austro, hungarian, foreign, minister, gyula, andr, ssy, and, british, foreign, secretary, marquess, of, salisbury, had, already, ended, on, 6, june, by, britain, agreeing, to, all, the, austrian, proposals, relative, to, bosnia, herzegovina, about, to, come, before, the, congress, while, austria, would, support, british, demands, the, congress, of, berlin, is, frequently, viewed, as, the, culmination, of, the, battle, between, alexander, gorchakov, of, russia, and, otto, von, bismarck, of, germany, both, were, able, to, persuade, other, european, leaders, that, a, free, and, independent, bulgaria, would, greatly, improve, the, security, risks, posed, by, a, disintegrating, ottoman, empire, according, to, historian, erich, eyck, bismarck, supported, russia, s, position, that, turkish, rule, over, a, christian, community, bulgaria, was, an, anachronism, which, undoubtedly, gave, rise, to, insurrection, and, bloodshed, and, should, therefore, be, ended, he, used, the, great, eastern, crisis, of, 1875, as, proof, of, growing, animosity, in, the, region, bismarck, s, ultimate, goal, during, the, congress, of, berlin, was, not, to, upset, germany, s, status, on, the, international, platform, he, did, not, wish, to, disrupt, the, league, of, the, three, emperors, by, choosing, between, russia, and, austria, as, an, ally, to, maintain, peace, in, europe, bismarck, sought, to, convince, other, european, diplomats, that, dividing, up, the, balkans, would, foster, greater, stability, during, the, process, russia, began, to, feel, cheated, despite, eventually, gaining, independence, for, bulgaria, problems, in, the, alliances, in, europe, before, the, first, world, war, were, thus, noticeable, one, reason, that, bismarck, was, able, to, mediate, the, various, tensions, at, the, congress, of, berlin, was, his, diplomatic, persona, he, sought, peace, and, stability, when, international, affairs, did, not, pertain, to, germany, directly, since, he, viewed, the, current, situation, in, europe, as, favourable, for, germany, any, conflicts, between, the, major, european, powers, that, threatened, the, status, quo, was, against, german, interests, also, at, the, congress, of, berlin, germany, could, not, look, for, any, advantage, from, the, crisis, that, had, occurred, in, the, balkans, in, 1875, therefore, bismarck, claimed, impartiality, on, behalf, of, germany, at, the, congress, which, enabled, him, to, preside, over, the, negotiations, with, a, keen, eye, for, foul, play, though, most, of, europe, went, into, the, congress, expecting, a, diplomatic, show, much, like, the, congress, of, vienna, they, were, to, be, sadly, disappointed, bismarck, unhappy, to, be, conducting, the, congress, in, the, heat, of, the, summer, had, a, short, temper, and, a, low, tolerance, for, malarky, thus, any, grandstanding, was, cut, short, by, the, testy, german, chancellor, the, ambassadors, from, the, small, balkan, territories, whose, fate, was, being, decided, were, barely, even, allowed, to, attend, the, diplomatic, meetings, which, were, between, mainly, the, representatives, of, the, great, powers, according, to, henry, kissinger, the, congress, saw, a, shift, in, bismarck, s, realpolitik, until, then, as, germany, had, become, too, powerful, for, isolation, his, policy, was, to, maintain, the, league, of, the, three, emperors, now, that, he, could, no, longer, rely, on, russia, s, alliance, he, began, to, form, relations, with, as, many, potential, enemies, as, possible, bowing, to, russia, s, pressure, romania, serbia, and, montenegro, were, all, declared, independent, principalities, russia, recovered, southern, bessarabia, which, it, had, annexed, in, the, russo, turkish, war, of, 1812, but, lost, to, moldavia, romania, in, 1856, after, the, crimean, war, the, bulgarian, state, that, russia, had, created, by, the, treaty, of, san, stefano, was, divided, into, the, principality, of, bulgaria, and, eastern, rumelia, both, of, which, were, given, nominal, autonomy, under, the, control, of, the, ottoman, empire, bulgaria, was, promised, autonomy, and, guarantees, were, made, against, turkish, interference, but, they, were, largely, ignored, romania, received, northern, dobruja, as, a, compensation, for, southern, bessarabia, but, even, so, it, did, not, benefit, of, substantial, gain, of, territory, despite, its, consistent, war, effort, alongside, russia, romanians, deeply, resented, the, loss, of, southern, bessarabia, and, russo, romanian, relationship, remained, very, cold, for, decades, montenegro, obtained, nik, i, along, with, the, primary, albanian, regions, of, podgorica, bar, and, plav, gusinje, the, ottoman, government, or, porte, agreed, to, obey, the, specifications, contained, in, the, organic, law, of, 1868, and, to, guarantee, the, civil, rights, of, non, muslim, subjects, the, region, of, bosnia, herzegovina, was, handed, over, to, the, administration, of, austria, hungary, which, also, obtained, the, right, to, garrison, the, sanjak, of, novi, pazar, a, small, border, region, between, montenegro, and, serbia, bosnia, and, herzegovina, were, put, on, the, fast, track, to, eventual, annexation, russia, agreed, that, macedonia, the, most, important, strategic, section, of, the, balkans, was, too, multinational, to, be, part, of, bulgaria, and, permitted, it, to, remain, under, the, ottoman, empire, eastern, rumelia, which, had, its, own, large, turkish, and, greek, minorities, became, an, autonomous, province, under, a, christian, ruler, with, its, capital, at, philippopolis, the, remaining, portions, of, the, original, greater, bulgaria, became, the, new, state, of, bulgaria, in, russia, the, congress, of, berlin, was, considered, to, be, a, dismal, failure, after, finally, defeating, the, turks, despite, many, past, inconclusive, russo, turkish, wars, many, russians, had, expected, something, colossal, a, redrawing, of, the, balkan, borders, in, support, of, russian, territorial, ambitions, instead, the, victory, resulted, in, an, austro, hungarian, gain, on, the, balkan, front, that, was, brought, about, by, the, rest, of, the, european, powers, preference, for, a, stronger, austria, hungarian, empire, which, threatened, basically, no, one, to, a, powerful, russia, which, had, been, locked, in, competition, with, britain, in, the, so, called, great, game, for, most, of, the, century, gorchakov, said, i, consider, the, berlin, treaty, the, darkest, page, in, my, life, many, russians, were, furious, over, the, european, repudiation, of, their, political, gains, and, though, there, was, some, thought, that, it, represented, only, a, minor, stumble, on, the, road, to, russian, hegemony, in, the, balkans, it, actually, gave, bosnia, herzegovina, and, serbia, over, to, austria, hungary, s, sphere, of, influence, and, essentially, removed, all, russian, influence, from, the, area, the, serbs, were, upset, with, russia, consenting, to, the, cession, of, bosnia, to, austria, risti, who, was, serbia, s, first, plenipotentiary, at, berlin, tells, how, he, asked, jomini, one, of, the, russian, delegates, what, consolation, remained, to, the, serbs, jomini, replied, that, it, would, have, to, be, the, thought, that, the, situation, was, only, temporary, because, within, fifteen, years, at, the, latest, we, shall, be, forced, to, fight, austria, vain, consolation, comments, risti, italy, was, dissatisfied, with, the, results, of, the, congress, and, the, tensions, between, greece, and, the, ottoman, empire, were, left, unresolved, bosnia, herzegovina, would, also, prove, to, be, problematic, for, the, austro, hungarian, empire, in, later, decades, the, league, of, the, three, emperors, established, in, 1873, was, destroyed, since, russia, saw, lack, of, german, support, on, the, issue, of, bulgaria, s, full, independence, as, a, breach, of, loyalty, and, the, alliance, the, border, between, greece, and, turkey, was, not, resolved, in, 1881, after, protracted, negotiations, a, compromise, border, was, accepted, after, a, naval, demonstration, of, the, great, powers, had, resulted, in, the, cession, of, thessaly, and, the, arta, prefecture, to, greece, two, states, that, didn, t, participate, in, the, war, great, britain, and, austria, hungary, achieved, great, benefits, from, this, congress, the, former, was, granted, administrative, control, of, cyprus, in, exchange, for, guarantees, that, britain, would, use, the, island, as, a, base, to, protect, the, ottoman, empire, against, possible, russian, aggression, the, latter, obtained, the, administration, of, bosnia, herzegovina, and, secured, the, control, of, a, corridor, leading, to, the, aegean, sea, both, of, these, territories, had, to, remain, de, jure, part, of, the, ottoman, empire, but, in, 1914, the, british, empire, formally, annexed, cyprus, whereas, bosnia, herzegovina, was, annexed, by, austria, in, 1908, thus, the, berlin, congress, sowed, the, seeds, of, further, conflicts, including, the, balkan, wars, and, ultimately, the, first, world, war, in, the, salisbury, circular, of, 1, april, 1878, the, british, foreign, secretary, the, marquess, of, salisbury, clarified, the, objections, of, him, and, the, government, to, the, treaty, of, san, stefano, because, of, the, favorable, position, in, which, it, left, russia, in, 1954, the, british, historian, a, j, p, taylor, wrote, if, the, treaty, of, san, stefano, had, been, maintained, both, the, ottoman, empire, and, austria, hungary, might, have, survived, to, the, present, day, the, british, except, for, beaconsfield, in, his, wilder, moments, had, expected, less, and, were, therefore, less, disappointed, salisbury, wrote, at, the, end, of, 1878, we, shall, set, up, a, rickety, sort, of, turkish, rule, again, south, of, the, balkans, but, it, is, a, mere, respite, there, is, no, vitality, left, in, them, though, the, congress, of, berlin, constituted, a, harsh, blow, to, pan, slavism, it, by, no, means, solved, the, question, of, the, area, the, slavs, in, the, balkans, were, still, mostly, under, non, slavic, rule, split, between, the, rule, of, austria, hungary, and, the, ailing, ottoman, empire, the, slavic, states, of, the, balkans, had, learned, that, banding, together, as, slavs, benefited, them, less, than, playing, to, the, desires, of, a, neighboring, great, power, that, damaged, the, unity, of, the, balkan, slavs, and, encouraged, competition, between, the, fledgling, slav, states, the, underlying, tensions, of, the, region, would, continue, to, simmer, for, thirty, years, until, they, again, exploded, in, the, balkan, wars, of, 1912, 1913, in, 1914, the, assassination, of, franz, ferdinand, the, austro, hungarian, heir, led, to, the, first, world, war, in, hindsight, the, stated, goal, of, maintaining, peace, and, balance, of, powers, in, the, balkans, obviously, failed, since, the, region, would, remain, a, source, of, conflict, between, the, great, powers, well, into, the, 20th, century, austro, hungarian, foreign, minister, gyula, andr, ssy, and, the, occupation, and, administration, of, bosnia, herzegovina, also, obtained, the, right, to, station, garrisons, in, the, sanjak, of, novi, pazar, which, remained, under, ottoman, administration, the, sanjak, preserved, the, separation, of, serbia, and, montenegro, and, the, austro, hungarian, garrisons, there, would, open, the, way, for, a, dash, to, salonika, that, would, bring, the, western, half, of, the, balkans, under, permanent, austrian, influence, high, military, authorities, desired, immediate, major, expedition, with, salonika, as, its, objective, on, 28, september, 1878, the, finance, minister, koloman, von, zell, threatened, to, resign, if, the, army, behind, which, stood, the, archduke, albert, were, allowed, to, advance, to, salonika, in, the, session, of, the, hungarian, parliament, of, 5, november, 1878, the, opposition, proposed, that, the, foreign, minister, should, be, impeached, for, violating, the, constitution, by, his, policy, during, the, near, east, crisis, and, by, the, occupation, of, bosnia, herzegovina, the, motion, was, lost, by, 179, to, 95, by, the, opposition, rank, and, file, the, gravest, accusations, were, raised, against, andrassy, united, kingdom, russia, germany, austria, hungary, france, kingdom, of, italy, ottoman, empire, romania, greece, serbia, montenegro, albanians, in, the, congress, 52, 30,
