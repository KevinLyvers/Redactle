allied, victory, paraguay, permanently, lost, its, claims, to, lands, amounting, to, almost, 40, of, its, prewar, claimed, territories, the, paraguayan, war, also, known, as, the, war, of, the, triple, alliance, was, a, south, american, war, that, lasted, from, 1864, to, 1870, it, was, fought, between, paraguay, and, the, triple, alliance, of, argentina, the, empire, of, brazil, and, uruguay, it, was, the, deadliest, and, bloodiest, inter, state, war, in, latin, american, history, paraguay, sustained, large, casualties, but, even, the, approximate, numbers, are, disputed, paraguay, was, forced, to, cede, disputed, territory, to, argentina, and, brazil, the, war, began, in, late, 1864, as, a, result, of, a, conflict, between, paraguay, and, brazil, caused, by, the, uruguayan, war, argentina, and, uruguay, entered, the, war, against, paraguay, in, 1865, and, it, then, became, known, as, the, war, of, the, triple, alliance, after, paraguay, was, defeated, in, conventional, warfare, it, conducted, a, drawn, out, guerrilla, resistance, a, strategy, that, resulted, in, the, further, destruction, of, the, paraguayan, military, and, the, civilian, population, much, of, the, civilian, population, died, due, to, battle, hunger, and, disease, the, guerrilla, war, lasted, for, 14, months, until, president, francisco, solano, l, pez, was, killed, in, action, by, brazilian, forces, in, the, battle, of, cerro, cor, on, 1, march, 1870, argentine, and, brazilian, troops, occupied, paraguay, until, 1876, since, their, independence, from, portugal, and, spain, in, the, early, 19th, century, the, empire, of, brazil, and, the, spanish, american, countries, of, south, america, were, troubled, by, territorial, disputes, each, nation, in, this, region, had, boundary, conflicts, with, multiple, neighbors, most, had, overlapping, claims, to, the, same, territories, due, to, unresolved, questions, which, stemmed, from, their, former, metropoles, signed, by, portugal, and, spain, in, 1494, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, proved, ineffective, in, the, following, centuries, as, both, colonial, powers, expanded, their, frontiers, in, south, america, and, elsewhere, the, outdated, boundary, lines, did, not, represent, the, actual, occupation, of, lands, by, the, portuguese, and, spanish, by, the, early, 1700s, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, was, deemed, not, useful, and, it, was, clear, to, both, parties, that, a, newer, treaty, had, to, be, drawn, based, on, feasible, boundaries, in, 1750, the, treaty, of, madrid, separated, the, portuguese, and, spanish, areas, of, south, america, in, lines, that, mostly, corresponded, to, present, day, boundaries, neither, portugal, nor, spain, was, satisfied, with, the, results, and, new, treaties, were, signed, in, the, following, decades, that, either, established, new, territorial, lines, or, repealed, them, the, final, accord, signed, by, both, powers, the, 1801, treaty, of, badajoz, reaffirmed, the, validity, of, the, previous, treaty, of, san, ildefonso, 1777, which, had, derived, from, the, older, treaty, of, madrid, the, territorial, disputes, became, worse, when, the, viceroyalty, of, the, r, o, de, la, plata, collapsed, in, the, early, 1810s, leading, to, the, rise, of, argentina, paraguay, bolivia, and, uruguay, historian, pelham, horton, box, wrote, imperial, spain, bequeathed, to, the, emancipated, spanish, american, nations, not, only, her, own, frontier, disputes, with, portuguese, brazil, but, problems, which, had, not, disturbed, her, relating, to, the, exact, boundaries, of, her, own, viceroyalties, captaincies, general, audiencias, and, provinces, once, separated, the, three, countries, quarreled, over, lands, that, were, mostly, uncharted, or, unknown, they, were, either, sparsely, populated, or, settled, by, indigenous, tribes, that, answered, to, no, parties, in, the, case, of, paraguay, and, brazil, the, problem, was, to, define, whether, the, apa, or, branco, rivers, should, represent, their, actual, boundary, a, persistent, issue, that, had, confused, spain, and, portugal, in, the, late, 18th, century, a, few, indigenous, tribes, populated, the, region, between, the, two, rivers, and, these, tribes, would, attack, brazilian, and, paraguayan, settlements, that, were, local, to, them, there, are, several, theories, regarding, the, origins, of, the, war, the, traditional, view, emphasizes, that, the, policies, of, paraguayan, president, francisco, solano, l, pez, used, the, uruguayan, war, as, a, pretext, to, gain, control, of, the, platine, basin, that, caused, a, response, from, the, regional, hegemons, brazil, and, argentina, both, of, which, exercised, influence, over, the, much, smaller, republics, of, uruguay, and, paraguay, the, war, has, also, been, attributed, to, the, aftermath, of, colonialism, in, south, america, with, border, conflicts, between, the, new, states, the, struggle, for, power, among, neighboring, nations, over, the, strategic, r, o, de, la, plata, region, brazilian, and, argentine, meddling, in, internal, uruguayan, politics, which, had, already, caused, the, platine, war, solano, l, pez, s, efforts, to, help, his, allies, in, uruguay, which, had, been, defeated, by, the, brazilians, and, his, presumed, expansionist, ambitions, a, strong, military, was, developed, because, paraguay, s, larger, neighbors, argentina, and, brazil, had, territorial, claims, against, it, and, wanted, to, dominate, it, politically, much, as, both, had, already, done, in, uruguay, paraguay, had, recurring, boundary, disputes, and, tariff, issues, with, argentina, and, brazil, for, many, years, during, the, rule, of, solano, lopez, s, predecessor, and, father, carlos, antonio, l, pez, in, the, time, since, brazil, and, argentina, had, become, independent, their, struggle, for, hegemony, in, the, r, o, de, la, plata, region, had, profoundly, marked, the, diplomatic, and, political, relations, among, the, countries, of, the, region, brazil, was, the, first, country, to, recognize, the, independence, of, paraguay, in, 1844, at, this, time, argentina, still, considered, it, a, breakaway, province, while, argentina, was, ruled, by, juan, manuel, rosas, 1829, 1852, a, common, enemy, of, both, brazil, and, paraguay, brazil, contributed, to, the, improvement, of, the, fortifications, and, development, of, the, paraguayan, army, sending, officials, and, technical, help, to, asunci, n, as, no, roads, linked, the, inland, province, of, mato, grosso, to, rio, de, janeiro, brazilian, ships, needed, to, travel, through, paraguayan, territory, going, up, the, paraguay, river, to, arrive, at, cuiab, however, brazil, had, difficulty, obtaining, permission, from, the, government, in, asunci, n, to, freely, use, the, paraguay, river, for, its, shipping, needs, brazil, had, carried, out, three, political, and, military, interventions, in, the, politically, unstable, uruguay, on, 19, april, 1863, uruguayan, general, venancio, flores, who, was, then, an, officer, in, the, argentine, army, as, well, as, the, leader, of, the, colorado, party, of, uruguay, invaded, his, country, starting, the, cruzada, libertadora, with, the, open, support, of, argentina, which, supplied, the, rebels, with, arms, ammunition, and, 2, 000, men, flores, wanted, to, overthrow, the, blanco, party, government, of, president, bernardo, berro, 24, which, was, allied, with, paraguay, 24, paraguayan, president, l, pez, sent, a, note, to, the, argentine, government, on, 6, september, 1863, asking, for, an, explanation, but, buenos, aires, denied, any, involvement, in, uruguay, 24, from, that, moment, mandatory, military, service, was, introduced, in, paraguay, in, february, 1864, an, additional, 64, 000, men, were, drafted, into, the, army, 24, one, year, after, the, beginning, of, the, cruzada, libertadora, in, april, 1864, brazilian, minister, jos, ant, nio, saraiva, arrived, in, uruguayan, waters, with, the, imperial, fleet, to, demand, payment, for, damages, caused, to, rio, grande, do, sul, farmers, in, border, conflicts, with, uruguayan, farmers, uruguayan, president, atanasio, aguirre, from, the, blanco, party, rejected, the, brazilian, demands, presented, his, own, demands, and, asked, paraguay, for, help, to, settle, the, growing, crisis, solano, l, pez, offered, himself, as, a, mediator, of, the, uruguayan, crisis, as, he, was, a, political, and, diplomatic, ally, of, the, uruguayan, blancos, but, the, offer, was, turned, down, by, brazil, brazilian, soldiers, on, the, northern, borders, of, uruguay, started, to, provide, help, to, flores, troops, and, harassed, uruguayan, officers, while, the, imperial, fleet, pressed, hard, on, montevideo, during, the, months, of, june, august, 1864, a, cooperation, treaty, was, signed, between, brazil, and, argentina, at, buenos, aires, for, mutual, assistance, in, the, plate, basin, crisis, brazilian, minister, saraiva, sent, an, ultimatum, to, the, uruguayan, government, on, 4, august, 1864, either, comply, with, the, brazilian, demands, or, the, brazilian, army, would, retaliate, the, paraguayan, government, was, informed, of, all, this, and, sent, to, brazil, a, message, which, stated, in, part, the, government, of, the, republic, of, paraguay, will, consider, any, occupation, of, the, oriental, territory, as, an, attempt, against, the, equilibrium, of, the, states, of, the, platine, region, which, interests, the, republic, of, paraguay, as, a, guarantee, for, its, security, peace, and, prosperity, and, that, it, protests, in, the, most, solemn, manner, against, the, act, freeing, itself, for, the, future, of, every, responsibility, that, may, arise, from, the, present, declaration, the, brazilian, government, probably, believing, that, the, paraguayan, threat, would, be, only, diplomatic, answered, on, 1, september, stating, that, they, will, never, abandon, the, duty, of, protecting, the, lives, and, interests, of, brazilian, subjects, but, in, its, answer, two, days, later, the, paraguayan, government, insisted, that, if, brazil, takes, the, measures, protested, against, in, the, note, of, august, 30th, 1864, paraguay, will, be, under, the, painful, necessity, of, making, its, protest, effective, on, 12, october, despite, the, paraguayan, notes, and, ultimatums, brazilian, troops, under, the, command, of, general, jo, o, prop, cio, mena, barreto, invaded, uruguay, 24, this, was, not, the, start, of, the, paraguayan, war, however, for, paraguay, continued, to, maintain, diplomatic, relations, with, brazil, for, another, month, on, 11, november, the, brazilian, ship, marqu, s, de, olinda, on, her, routine, voyage, up, the, river, paraguay, to, the, brazilian, mato, grosso, and, carrying, the, new, governor, of, that, province, docked, at, asunci, n, and, took, on, coal, completing, the, formalities, she, continued, on, her, journey, according, to, one, source, l, pez, hesitated, whether, to, break, the, peace, for, a, whole, day, saying, if, we, don, t, have, a, war, now, with, brazil, we, shall, have, one, at, a, less, convenient, time, for, ourselves, l, pez, then, ordered, the, paraguayan, ship, tacuar, to, pursue, her, and, compel, her, return, on, 12, november, tacuar, caught, up, with, marqu, s, de, olinda, in, the, vicinity, of, concepci, n, fired, across, her, bows, and, ordered, her, to, return, to, asunci, n, when, she, arrived, on, the, 13th, all, on, board, were, arrested, on, the, 12th, paraguay, informed, the, brazilian, minister, in, asunci, n, that, diplomatic, relations, had, been, broken, off, the, conflict, between, brazil, and, uruguay, was, settled, in, february, 1865, news, of, the, war, s, end, was, brought, by, pereira, pinto, and, met, with, joy, in, rio, de, janeiro, brazilian, emperor, pedro, ii, found, himself, waylaid, by, a, crowd, of, thousands, in, the, streets, amid, acclamations, however, public, opinion, quickly, changed, for, the, worse, when, newspapers, began, running, stories, painting, the, convention, of, 20, february, as, harmful, to, brazilian, interests, for, which, the, cabinet, was, blamed, the, newly, promoted, viscount, of, tamandar, and, mena, barreto, now, baron, of, s, o, gabriel, had, supported, the, peace, accord, tamandar, changed, his, mind, soon, afterward, and, played, along, with, the, allegations, a, member, of, the, opposition, party, jos, paranhos, viscount, of, rio, branco, was, used, as, a, scapegoat, by, the, emperor, and, the, government, and, was, recalled, in, disgrace, to, the, imperial, capital, the, accusation, that, the, convention, had, failed, to, meet, brazilian, interests, proved, to, be, unfounded, not, only, had, paranhos, managed, to, settle, all, brazilian, claims, but, by, preventing, the, death, of, thousands, he, gained, a, willing, and, grateful, uruguayan, ally, instead, of, a, dubious, and, resentful, one, which, provided, brazil, with, an, important, base, of, operations, during, the, acute, clash, with, paraguay, that, shortly, ensued, according, to, some, historians, paraguay, began, the, war, with, over, 60, 000, trained, men, 38, 000, of, whom, were, already, under, arms, 400, cannons, a, naval, squadron, of, 23, steamboats, and, five, river, navigating, ships, among, them, the, gunboat, tacuar, communication, in, the, r, o, de, la, plata, basin, was, maintained, solely, by, river, as, very, few, roads, existed, whoever, controlled, the, rivers, would, win, the, war, so, paraguay, had, built, fortifications, on, the, banks, of, the, lower, end, of, the, paraguay, river, 28, 30, however, recent, studies, suggest, many, problems, although, the, paraguayan, army, had, between, 70, 000, and, 100, 000, men, at, the, beginning, of, the, conflict, they, were, badly, equipped, most, infantry, armaments, consisted, of, inaccurate, smooth, bore, muskets, and, carbines, slow, to, reload, and, short, ranged, the, artillery, was, similarly, poor, military, officers, had, no, training, or, experience, and, there, was, no, command, system, as, all, decisions, were, made, personally, by, l, pez, food, ammunition, and, armaments, were, scarce, with, logistics, and, hospital, care, deficient, or, nonexistent, the, nation, of, about, 450, 000, people, could, not, stand, against, the, triple, alliance, of, 11, million, people, the, paraguayan, army, during, peacetime, prior, to, the, war, was, made, up, of, eight, infantry, battalions, of, 800, men, each, but, had, only, been, able, to, muster, 4, 084, five, cavalry, regiments, nominally, 2, 500, 2, 522, in, reality, and, two, artillery, regiments, with, 907, men, by, march, 1865, six, new, infantry, battalions, and, eight, cavalry, regiments, had, been, formed, in, addition, the, paraguayans, could, rely, on, their, militia, which, consisted, of, all, able, bodied, men, which, as, the, war, continued, began, to, include, increasingly, younger, and, older, men, at, the, beginning, of, the, war, the, military, forces, of, brazil, argentina, and, uruguay, were, far, smaller, than, paraguay, s, argentina, had, approximately, 8, 500, regular, troops, and, a, naval, squadron, of, four, steamers, and, one, schooner, uruguay, entered, the, war, with, fewer, than, 2, 000, men, and, no, navy, many, of, brazil, s, 16, 000, troops, were, located, in, its, southern, garrisons, the, brazilian, advantage, though, was, in, its, navy, comprising, 45, ships, with, 239, cannons, and, about, 4, 000, well, trained, crew, a, great, part, of, the, squadron, was, already, in, the, rio, de, la, plata, basin, where, it, had, acted, under, the, marquis, of, tamandar, in, the, intervention, against, aguirre, s, government, brazil, however, was, unprepared, to, fight, a, war, its, army, was, disorganized, the, troops, it, used, in, uruguay, were, mostly, armed, contingents, of, gauchos, and, the, national, guard, while, some, brazilian, accounts, of, the, war, described, their, infantry, as, volunteers, volunt, rios, da, p, tria, other, argentine, revisionist, and, paraguayan, accounts, disparaged, the, brazilian, infantry, as, mainly, recruited, from, slaves, and, the, landless, largely, black, underclass, who, were, promised, free, land, for, enlisting, the, cavalry, was, formed, from, the, national, guard, of, rio, grande, do, sul, ultimately, a, total, of, about, 146, 000, brazilians, fought, in, the, war, from, 1864, to, 1870, consisting, of, the, 10, 025, army, soldiers,

both, leaders, 62, l, pez, had, realized, that, the, war, was, lost, and, was, ready, to, sign, a, peace, treaty, with, the, allies, however, no, agreement, was, reached, since, mitre, s, conditions, for, signing, the, treaty, were, that, every, article, of, the, treaty, of, the, triple, alliance, was, to, be, carried, out, a, condition, that, solano, l, pez, refused, article, 6, of, the, treaty, made, truce, or, peace, with, l, pez, nearly, impossible, as, it, stipulated, that, the, war, was, to, continue, until, the, then, government, ceased, to, be, which, meant, the, removal, of, solano, l, pez, after, the, conference, the, allies, marched, into, paraguayan, territory, reaching, the, defensive, line, of, curupayty, trusting, their, numerical, superiority, and, the, possibility, of, attacking, the, flank, of, the, defensive, line, through, the, paraguay, river, by, using, the, brazilian, ships, the, allies, made, a, frontal, assault, on, the, defensive, line, supported, by, the, flank, fire, of, the, battleships, however, the, paraguayans, commanded, by, general, jos, e, d, az, stood, strong, in, their, positions, and, set, up, for, a, defensive, battle, inflicting,

brazilians, and, said, that, porto, alegre, and, tamandar, who, are, cousins, and, cousins, even, in, lack, of, judgement, have, made, a, family, pact, to, monopolize, in, practice, the, command, of, war, he, further, criticized, porto, alegre, it, is, impossible, to, imagine, a, greater, military, nullity, than, this, general, to, which, it, can, be, added, tamandar, s, dominating, bad, influence, over, him, and, the, negative, spirit, of, both, in, relation, to, the, allies, owning, to, passions, and, petty, interests, the, brazilian, government, decided, to, create, a, unified,

officers, who, talked, of, surrender, paranoia, prevailed, in, the, army, and, soldiers, fought, to, the, bitter, end, in, a, resistance, movement, resulting, in, more, destruction, in, the, country, two, detachments, were, sent, in, pursuit, of, solano, l, pez, who, was, accompanied, by, 200, men, in, the, forests, in, the, north, on, 1, march, 1870, the, troops, of, general, jos, ant, nio,

weak, to, walk, he, was, escorted, by, his, aide, and, a, pair, of, officers, who, led, him, to, the, banks, of, the, aquidaban, nigui, river, the, officers, left, solano, l, pez, and, his, aide, there, while, they, looked, for, reinforcements, before, they, returned, c, mara, arrived, with, a, small, number, of, soldiers, though, he, offered, to, permit, solano, l, pez, to, surrender, and, guaranteed, his, life, solano, l, pez, refused, shouting, i, die, with, my, homeland, he, tried, to, attack, c, mara, with, his, sword, he, was, quickly, killed, by, c, mara, s, men, bringing, an, end, to, the, long, conflict, in, 1870, paraguay, suffered, massive, casualties, and, the, war, s, disruption, and, disease, also, cost, civilian, lives, some, historians, estimate, that, the, nation, lost, the, majority, of, its, population, the, specific, numbers, are, hotly, disputed, and, range, widely, a, survey, of, 14, estimates, of, paraguay, s, pre, war, population, varied, between, 300, 000, and, 1, 337, 000, later, academic, work, based, on, demographics, produced, a, wide, range, of, estimates, from, a, possible, low, of, 21, 000, 7, of, population, reber, 1988, to, as, high, as, 69, of, the, total, prewar, population, whigham, potthast, 1999, because, of, the, local, situation, all, casualty, figures, are, a, very, rough, estimate, accurate, casualty, numbers, may, never, be, determined, after, the, war, an, 1871, census, recorded, 221, 079, inhabitants, of, which, 106, 254, were, women, 28, 746, were, men, and, 86, 079, were, children, with, no, indication, of, sex, or, upper, age, limit, the, worst, reports, are, that, up, to, 90, of, the, male, population, was, killed, though, this, figure, is, without, support, one, estimate, places, total, paraguayan, losses, through, both, war, and, disease, as, high, as, 1, 2, million, people, or, 90, of, its, pre, war, population, but, modern, scholarship, has, shown, that, this, number, depends, on, a, population, census, of, 1857, that, was, a, government, invention, a, different, estimate, places, paraguayan, deaths, at, approximately, 300, 000, people, out, of, 500, 000, to, 525, 000, pre, war, inhabitants, during, the, war, many, men, and, boys, fled, to, the, countryside, and, forests, in, the, estimation, of, vera, blinn, reber, however, the, evidence, demonstrates, that, the, paraguayan, population, casualties, due, to, the, war, have, been, enormously, exaggerated, a, 1999, study, by, thomas, whigham, from, the, university, of, georgia, and, barbara, potthast, published, in, the, latin, american, research, review, under, the, title, the, paraguayan, rosetta, stone, new, evidence, on, the, demographics, of, the, paraguayan, war, 1864, 1870, and, later, expanded, in, the, 2002, essay, titled, refining, the, numbers, a, response, to, reber, and, kleinpenning, used, a, methodology, to, yield, more, accurate, figures, to, establish, the, population, before, the, war, whigham, used, an, 1846, census, and, calculated, based, on, a, population, growth, rate, of, 1, 7, to, 2, 5, annually, which, was, the, standard, rate, at, that, time, that, the, immediately, pre, war, paraguayan, population, in, 1864, was, approximately, 420, 000, 450, 000, based, on, a, census, carried, out, after, the, war, ended, in, 1870, 1871, whigham, concluded, that, 150, 000, 160, 000, paraguayan, people, had, survived, of, whom, only, 28, 000, were, adult, males, in, total, 60, 70, of, the, population, died, as, a, result, of, the, war, leaving, a, woman, man, ratio, of, 4, to, 1, as, high, as, 20, to, 1, in, the, most, devastated, areas, for, academic, criticism, of, the, whigham, potthast, methodology, and, estimates, see, the, main, article, paraguayan, war, casualties, steven, pinker, wrote, that, assuming, a, death, rate, of, over, 60, of, the, paraguayan, population, this, war, was, proportionally, one, of, the, most, destructive, in, modern, times, for, any, nation, state, as, was, common, before, antibiotics, were, developed, disease, caused, more, deaths, than, war, wounds, bad, food, and, poor, sanitation, contributed, to, disease, among, troops, and, civilians, among, the, brazilians, two, thirds, of, the, dead, died, either, in, a, hospital, or, on, the, march, at, the, beginning, of, the, conflict, most, brazilian, soldiers, came, from, the, north, and, northeast, regions, the, change, from, a, hot, to, a, colder, climate, combined, with, restricted, food, rations, may, have, weakened, their, resistance, entire, battalions, of, brazilians, were, recorded, as, dying, after, drinking, water, from, rivers, therefore, some, historians, believe, cholera, transmitted, in, the, water, was, a, leading, cause, of, death, during, the, war, paraguayan, women, played, a, significant, role, in, the, paraguayan, war, during, the, period, just, before, the, war, began, many, paraguayan, women, were, the, heads, of, their, households, meaning, they, held, a, position, of, power, and, authority, they, received, such, positions, by, being, widows, having, children, out, of, wedlock, or, their, husbands, having, worked, as, peons, when, the, war, began, women, started, to, venture, out, of, the, home, becoming, nurses, working, with, government, officials, and, establishing, themselves, into, the, public, sphere, when, the, new, york, times, reported, on, the, war, in, 1868, it, considered, paraguayan, women, equal, to, their, male, counterparts, paraguayan, women, s, support, of, the, war, effort, can, be, divided, into, two, stages, the, first, is, from, the, time, the, war, began, in, 1864, to, the, paraguayan, evacuation, of, asunci, n, in, late, 1868, during, this, period, of, the, war, peasant, women, became, practically, the, sole, producers, of, agricultural, goods, the, second, stage, begins, when, the, war, turned, to, a, more, guerrilla, form, it, started, when, the, capital, of, paraguay, fell, and, ended, with, the, death, of, paraguay, s, president, francisco, solano, l, pez, in, 1870, at, this, stage, the, number, of, women, becoming, victims, of, war, was, increasing, the, government, press, with, doubtful, veracity, claimed, that, battalions, of, women, were, formed, to, fight, the, allies, and, exalted, the, role, of, ramona, mart, nez, who, was, a, woman, enslaved, by, l, pez, as, the, american, joan, of, arc, for, her, fighting, and, rallying, of, injured, troops, women, helped, sustain, paraguayan, society, during, a, very, unstable, period, though, paraguay, did, lose, the, war, the, outcome, might, have, been, even, more, disastrous, without, women, performing, specific, tasks, women, worked, as, farmers, soldiers, nurses, and, government, officials, they, became, a, symbol, for, national, unification, and, at, the, end, of, the, war, the, traditions, women, maintained, were, part, of, what, held, the, nation, together, a, 2012, piece, in, the, economist, argued, that, with, the, death, of, most, of, paraguay, s, male, population, the, paraguayan, war, distorted, the, sex, ratio, to, women, greatly, outnumbering, men, and, has, impacted, the, sexual, culture, of, paraguay, to, this, day, because, of, the, depopulation, men, were, encouraged, after, the, war, to, have, multiple, children, with, multiple, women, even, supposedly, celibate, catholic, priests, a, columnist, linked, this, cultural, idea, to, the, paternity, scandal, of, former, president, fernando, lugo, who, fathered, multiple, children, while, he, was, a, supposedly, celibate, priest, prior, to, the, war, indigenous, people, occupied, very, little, space, in, the, minds, of, the, paraguayan, elite, paraguayan, president, carlos, antonio, lopez, even, modified, the, country, s, constitution, in, 1844, to, remove, any, mention, of, paraguay, s, hispano, guarani, character, this, marginalization, was, undercut, by, the, fact, that, paraguay, had, long, prized, its, military, as, its, only, honorable, and, national, institution, and, the, majority, of, the, paraguayan, military, was, indigenous, and, spoke, guarani, however, during, the, war, the, indigenous, people, of, paraguay, came, to, occupy, an, even, larger, role, in, public, life, especially, after, the, battle, of, estero, bellaco, for, this, battle, paraguay, put, its, best, men, who, happened, to, be, of, spanish, descent, front, and, center, paraguay, overwhelmingly, lost, this, battle, as, well, as, the, males, of, all, the, best, families, in, the, country, the, now, remaining, members, of, the, military, were, old, men, who, had, been, left, in, humaita, indians, slaves, and, boys, the, war, also, bonded, the, indigenous, people, of, paraguay, to, the, project, of, paraguayan, nation, building, in, the, immediate, lead, up, to, the, war, they, were, confronted, with, a, barrage, of, nationalist, rhetoric, in, spanish, and, guarani, and, subject, to, loyalty, oaths, and, exercises, paraguayan, president, francisco, solano, lopez, son, of, carlos, antonio, lopez, was, well, aware, that, the, guarani, speaking, people, of, paraguay, had, a, group, identity, independent, of, the, spanish, speaking, paraguayan, elite, he, knew, he, would, have, to, bridge, this, divide, or, risk, it, being, exploited, by, the, triple, alliance, to, a, certain, extent, lopez, succeeded, in, getting, the, indigenous, people, to, expand, their, communal, identity, to, include, all, of, paraguay, as, a, result, of, this, any, attack, on, paraguay, was, considered, to, be, an, attack, on, the, paraguayan, nation, despite, rhetoric, from, brazil, uruguay, and, argentina, saying, otherwise, this, sentiment, increased, after, the, terms, of, the, treaty, of, the, triple, alliance, were, leaked, especially, the, clause, stating, that, paraguay, would, pay, for, all, the, damages, incurred, by, the, conflict, the, brazilian, government, allowed, the, creation, of, black, only, units, or, zuavos, in, the, military, at, the, outset, of, the, war, following, the, proposal, of, afro, brazilian, quirino, ant, nio, do, esp, rito, santo, a, veteran, of, the, brazilian, war, of, independence, over, the, course, of, the, war, the, zuavos, became, an, increasingly, attractive, option, for, many, enslaved, afro, brazilian, men, especially, given, the, z, uavos, negative, opinion, toward, slavery, once, the, zuavos, had, enlisted, or, forcibly, recruited, them, it, became, difficult, for, their, masters, to, regain, possession, of, them, since, the, government, was, desperate, for, soldiers, by, 1867, black, only, units, were, no, longer, permitted, with, the, entire, military, being, integrated, just, as, it, had, been, prior, to, the, war, the, overarching, rationale, behind, this, was, that, the, country, needed, recruits, for, its, existing, battalions, not, more, independently, organized, companies, this, did, not, mean, the, end, of, black, soldiers, in, the, brazilian, military, on, the, contrary, impoverished, gente, de, cor, constituted, the, greater, part, of, the, soldiery, in, every, brazilian, infantry, battalion, afro, brazilian, women, played, a, key, role, in, sustaining, the, brazilian, military, as, vivandeiras, vivandeiras, were, poor, women, who, traveled, with, the, soldiers, to, undertake, logistic, tasks, such, as, carrying, tents, preparing, food, and, doing, laundry, for, most, of, these, women, the, principal, reason, they, became, vivandeiras, was, because, their, male, loved, ones, had, joined, as, soldiers, and, they, wanted, to, take, care, of, them, however, the, brazilian, government, actively, worked, to, minimize, the, importance, of, their, work, by, labeling, it, service, to, their, male, kin, not, the, nation, and, considering, it, to, be, natural, and, habitual, the, reality, was, that, the, government, depended, heavily, on, these, women, and, officially, required, their, presence, in, the, camps, poor, afro, brazilian, women, also, served, as, nurses, with, most, of, them, being, trained, upon, entry, into, the, military, to, assist, male, doctors, in, the, camps, these, women, were, seeking, gainful, employment, to, compensate, for, the, loss, of, income, from, male, kin, who, had, been, drafted, into, the, war, paraguay, permanently, lost, its, claim, to, territories, which, before, the, war, were, in, dispute, between, it, and, brazil, or, argentina, respectively, in, total, about, 140, 000, square, kilometres, 54, 000, sq, mi, were, affected, those, disputes, had, been, longstanding, and, complex, in, colonial, times, certain, lands, lying, to, the, north, of, the, river, apa, were, in, dispute, between, the, portuguese, empire, and, the, spanish, empire, after, independence, they, continued, to, be, disputed, between, the, empire, of, brazil, and, the, republic, of, paraguay, after, the, war, brazil, signed, a, separate, loizaga, cotegipe, treaty, of, peace, and, borders, with, paraguay, on, 9, january, 1872, in, which, it, obtained, freedom, of, navigation, on, the, paraguay, river, brazil, also, retained, the, northern, regions, it, had, claimed, before, the, war, those, regions, are, now, part, of, its, state, of, mato, grosso, do, sul, in, colonial, times, the, missionary, jesuits, established, numerous, villages, in, lands, between, the, rivers, paran, and, uruguay, after, the, jesuits, were, expelled, from, spanish, territory, in, 1767, the, ecclesiastical, authorities, of, both, asunci, n, and, buenos, aires, made, claim, to, religious, jurisdiction, in, these, lands, and, the, spanish, government, sometimes, awarded, it, to, one, side, sometimes, to, the, other, sometimes, they, split, the, difference, after, independence, the, republic, of, paraguay, and, the, argentine, confederation, succeeded, to, these, disputes, on, 19, july, 1852, the, governments, of, the, argentine, confederation, and, paraguay, signed, a, treaty, by, which, paraguay, relinquished, its, claim, to, the, misiones, however, this, treaty, did, not, become, binding, because, it, required, to, be, ratified, by, the, argentine, congress, which, refused, paraguay, s, claim, was, still, alive, on, the, eve, of, the, war, after, the, war, the, disputed, lands, definitively, became, the, argentine, national, territory, of, misiones, now, misiones, province, the, gran, chaco, is, an, area, lying, to, the, west, of, the, river, paraguay, before, the, war, it, was, an, enormous, plain, covered, by, swamps, chaparral, and, thorn, forests, home, to, many, groups, of, feared, indians, including, the, guaicur, toba, and, mocov, there, had, long, been, overlapping, claims, to, all, or, parts, of, this, area, by, the, argentine, confederation, bolivia, and, paraguay, with, some, exceptions, these, were, paper, claims, because, none, of, those, countries, was, in, effective, occupation, of, the, area, essentially, they, were, claims, to, be, the, true, successor, to, the, spanish, empire, in, an, area, never, effectively, occupied, by, spain, itself, and, wherein, spain, had, no, particular, motive, for, prescribing, internal, boundaries, the, exceptions, were, as, follows, first, to, defend, itself, against, indian, incursions, both, in, colonial, times, and, after, the, authorities, in, asunci, n, had, established, some, border, fortlets, on, the, west, bank, of, the, river, paraguay, a, coastal, strip, within, the, chaco, by, the, same, treaty, of, 19, july, 1852, between, paraguay, and, the, argentine, confederation, an, undefined, area, in, the, chaco, north, of, the, bermejo, river, was, implicitly, conceded, to, belong, to, paraguay, as, already, stated, the, argentine, congress, refused, to, ratify, this, treaty, and, it, was, protested, by, the, government, of, bolivia, as, inimical, to, its, own, claims, the, second, exception, was, that, in, 1854, the, government, of, carlos, antonio, l, pez, established, a, colony, of, french, immigrants, on, the, right, bank, of, the, river, paraguay, at, nueva, burdeos, when, it, failed, it, was, renamed, villa, occidental, after, 1852, and, more, especially, after, the, state, of, buenos, aires, rejoined, the, argentine, confederation, argentina, s, claim, to, the, chaco, hardened, it, claimed, territory, all, the, way, up, to, the, border, with, bolivia, by, article, xvi, of, the, treaty, of, the, triple, alliance, argentina, was, to, receive, this, territory, in, full, however, the, brazilian, government, disliked, what, its, representative, in, buenos, aires, had, negotiated, in, this, respect, and, resolved, that, argentina, should, not, receive, a, handsbreadth, of, territory, above, the, pilcomayo, river, it, set, out, to, frustrate, argentina, s, further, claim, with, eventual, success, the, post, war, border, between, paraguay, and, argentina, was, resolved, through, long, negotiations, completed, 3, february, 1876, by, signing, the, macha, n, irigoyen, treaty, this, treaty, granted, argentina, roughly, one, third, of, the, area, it, had, originally, desired, argentina, became, the, strongest, of, the, river, plate, countries, when, the, two, parties, could, not, reach, consensus, on, the, fate, of, the, chaco, boreal, area, between, the, r, o, verde, and, the, main, branch, of, r, o, pilcomayo, the, president, of, the, united, states, rutherford, b, hayes, was, asked, to, arbitrate, his, award, was, in, paraguay, s, favor, the, paraguayan, presidente, hayes, department, is, named, in, his, honor, there, was, destruction, of, the, existing, state, loss, of, neighboring, territories, and, ruin, of, the, paraguayan, economy, so, that, even, decades, later, it, could, not, develop, in, the, same, way, as, its, neighbors, paraguay, is, estimated, to, have, lost, up, to, 69, of, its, population, most, of, them, due, to, illness, hunger, and, physical, exhaustion, of, whom, 90, were, male, and, also, maintained, a, high, debt, of, war, with, the, allied, countries, that, not, completely, paid, ended, up, being, pardoned, in, 1943, by, the, brazilian, president, get, lio, vargas, a, new, pro, brazil, government, was, installed, in, asunci, n, in, 1869, while, paraguay, remained, occupied, by, brazilian, forces, until, 1876, when, argentina, formally, recognized, the, independence, of, that, country, guaranteeing, its, sovereignty, and, leaving, it, a, buffer, state, between, its, larger, neighbors, the, war, helped, the, brazilian, empire, to, reach, its, peak, of, political, and, military, influence, becoming, the, great, power, of, south, america, and, also, helped, to, bring, about, the, end, of, slavery, in, brazil, moving, the, military, into, a, key, role, in, the, public, sphere, however, the, war, caused, a, ruinous, increase, of, public, debt, which, took, decades, to, pay, off, severely, limiting, the, country, s, growth, the, war, debt, alongside, a, long, lasting, social, crisis, after, the, conflict, are, regarded, as, crucial, factors, for, the, fall, of, the, empire, and, proclamation, of, the, first, brazilian, republic, during, the, war, the, brazilian, army, took, complete, control, of, paraguayan, territory, and, occupied, the, country, for, six, years, after, 1870, in, part, this, was, to, prevent, the, annexation, of, even, more, territory, by, argentina, which, had, wanted, to, seize, the, entire, chaco, region, during, this, time, brazil, and, argentina, had, strong, tensions, with, the, threat, of, armed, conflict, between, them, during, the, wartime, sacking, of, asunci, n, brazilian, soldiers, carried, off, war, trophies, among, the, spoils, taken, was, a, large, caliber, gun, called, cristiano, named, because, it, was, cast, from, church, bells, of, asunci, n, melted, down, for, the, war, in, brazil, the, war, exposed, the, fragility, of, the, empire, and, dissociated, the, monarchy, from, the, army, the, brazilian, army, became, a, new, and, influential, force, in, national, life, it, developed, as, a, strong, national, institution, that, with, the, war, gained, tradition, and, internal, cohesion, the, army, would, take, a, significant, role, in, the, later, development, of, the, history, of, the, country, the, economic, depression, and, the, strengthening, of, the, army, later, played, a, large, role, in, the, deposition, of, the, emperor, pedro, ii, and, the, republican, proclamation, in, 1889, marshal, deodoro, da, fonseca, became, the, first, brazilian, president, as, in, other, countries, wartime, recruitment, of, slaves, in, the, americas, rarely, implied, a, complete, rejection, of, slavery, and, usually, acknowledged, masters, rights, over, their, property, brazil, compensated, owners, who, freed, slaves, for, the, purpose, of, fighting, in, the, war, on, the, condition, that, the, freedmen, immediately, enlist, it, also, impressed, slaves, from, owners, when, needing, manpower, and, paid, compensation, in, areas, near, the, conflict, slaves, took, advantage, of, wartime, conditions, to, escape, and, some, fugitive, slaves, volunteered, for, the, army, together, these, effects, undermined, the, institution, of, slavery, but, the, military, also, upheld, owners, property, rights, as, it, returned, at, least, 36, fugitive, slaves, to, owners, who, could, satisfy, its, requirement, for, legal, proof, significantly, slavery, was, not, officially, ended, until, the, 1880s, brazil, spent, close, to, 614, 000, r, is, the, brazilian, currency, at, the, time, which, were, gained, from, the, following, sources, due, to, the, war, brazil, ran, a, deficit, between, 1870, and, 1880, which, was, finally, paid, off, at, the, time, foreign, loans, were, not, significant, sources, of, funds, following, the, war, argentina, faced, many, federalist, revolts, against, the, national, government, economically, it, benefited, from, having, sold, supplies, to, the, brazilian, army, but, the, war, overall, decreased, the, national, treasure, the, national, action, contributed, to, the, consolidation, of, the, centralized, government, after, revolutions, were, put, down, and, the, growth, in, influence, of, army, leadership, it, has, been, argued, the, conflict, played, a, key, role, in, the, consolidation, of, argentina, as, a, nation, state, that, country, became, one, of, the, wealthiest, in, the, world, by, the, early, 20th, century, it, was, the, last, time, that, brazil, and, argentina, openly, took, such, an, interventionist, role, in, uruguay, s, internal, politics, by, the, account, of, historian, mateo, martinic, the, war, put, a, temporary, hold, on, argentine, plans, to, challenge, the, chilean, occupation, of, the, strait, of, magellan, uruguay, suffered, lesser, effects, although, nearly, 5, 000, soldiers, were, killed, as, a, consequence, of, the, war, the, colorados, gained, political, control, of, uruguay, and, despite, rebellions, retained, it, until, 1958, interpretation, of, the, causes, of, the, war, and, its, aftermath, has, been, a, controversial, topic, in, the, histories, of, participating, countries, especially, in, paraguay, there, it, has, been, considered, either, a, fearless, struggle, for, the, rights, of, a, smaller, nation, against, the, aggression, of, more, powerful, neighbors, or, a, foolish, attempt, to, fight, an, unwinnable, war, that, almost, destroyed, the, nation, several, revisionist, historians, consider, the, mass, extermination, of, the, paraguayan, people, during, the, war, to, be, a, case, of, genocide, in, 2022, the, mercosur, parliament, formed, the, sub, commission, for, truth, and, justice, on, the, war, of, the, triple, alliance, within, its, human, rights, commission, to, investigate, the, potential, crimes, including, genocide, committed, during, the, war, and, then, arrive, at, a, consensual, truth, on, the, matter, within, the, parliament, in, december, 1975, after, presidents, ernesto, geisel, of, brazil, and, alfredo, stroessner, of, paraguay, signed, a, treaty, of, friendship, and, co, operation, in, asunci, n, the, brazilian, government, returned, some, of, its, spoils, of, war, to, paraguay, but, has, kept, others, in, april, 2013, paraguay, renewed, demands, for, the, return, of, the, christian, cannon, brazil, has, had, this, on, display, at, the, former, military, garrison, now, used, as, the, national, history, museum, and, says, that, it, is, part, of, its, history, as, well, a, popular, belief, among, paraguayans, and, argentine, revisionists, since, the, 1960s, contends, that, the, outbreak, of, war, was, due, to, the, machinations, of, the, british, government, a, theory, which, historians, have, noted, has, little, to, no, basis, in, historical, evidence, in, brazil, some, have, claimed, that, the, united, kingdom, was, the, primary, source, of, financing, for, the, triple, alliance, during, the, war, with, british, aid, being, given, in, order, to, advance, britain, s, economic, interests, in, the, region, something, which, historians, have, noted, that, has, little, evidence, to, support, it, as, well, noting, that, from, 1863, to, 1865, brazil, and, great, britain, were, engaged, in, a, diplomatic, incident, and, five, months, after, the, outbreak, of, the, paraguayan, war, the, two, countries, temporarily, broke, off, relations, they, have, also, noted, that, in, 1864, a, british, diplomat, wrote, a, letter, to, solano, l, pez, asking, him, to, avoid, initiating, hostilities, in, the, region, and, there, remains, no, evidence, that, britain, forced, the, allies, to, attack, paraguay, some, left, wing, historians, of, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, most, notably, eric, hobsbawm, in, his, work, the, age, of, capital, 1848, 1875, claimed, that, the, paraguayan, war, broke, out, as, a, result, of, british, influence, on, the, continent, claiming, that, as, britain, needed, a, new, source, of, cotton, during, the, american, civil, war, as, the, blockaded, american, south, had, been, their, main, cotton, supplier, before, the, war, right, wing, and, even, far, right, wing, historians, especially, from, argentina, and, paraguay, have, also, claimed, that, british, influence, was, a, major, reason, for, the, outbreak, of, war, noteworthy, is, the, fact, that, both, the, great, soviet, encyclopedia, and, the, great, russian, encyclopedia, considered, as, official, sources, of, the, ussr, and, the, russian, federation, respectively, also, claim, that, the, british, empire, had, much, to, do, for, sustaining, the, war, effort, and, finances, of, the, triple, alliance, against, paraguay, a, document, which, has, been, used, to, support, this, claim, is, a, letter, from, edward, thornton, minister, of, great, britain, in, the, plate, basin, to, british, prime, minister, lord, john, russell, which, contained, the, following, statement, the, ignorant, and, barbaric, people, of, paraguay, believe, that, it, is, under, the, protection, of, the, most, illustrious, of, the, governments, and, only, with, foreign, intervention, or, a, war, they, will, be, relieved, from, their, error, charles, washburn, who, was, the, minister, of, the, united, states, to, paraguay, and, argentina, claimed, that, thornton, spoke, of, paraguay, months, before, the, outbreak, of, the, conflict, as, worst, than, abyssinia, and, l, pez, is, worst, than, king, tewodros, ii, the, extinction, as, a, nation, will, be, benefit, to, all, the, world, however, historian, e, n, tate, noted, that, whatever, his, dislike, of, paraguay, thornton, appears, to, have, had, no, wish, that, its, quarrels, with, argentina, and, brazil, rapidly, worsening, at, the, time, of, his, visit, to, asunci, n, should, develop, into, war, his, influence, in, buenos, aires, seems, to, have, been, used, consistently, during, the, next, few, months, in, the, interests, of, peace, other, historians, have, also, disputed, the, claims, of, british, influence, in, the, outbreak, of, war, pointing, out, that, there, is, no, documented, evidence, for, it, they, note, that, although, the, british, economy, and, commercial, interests, benefited, from, the, war, the, british, government, opposed, it, from, the, start, in, addition, they, also, noted, that, the, war, damaged, international, commerce, including, britain, s, and, the, british, government, disapproved, of, the, secret, clauses, in, the, treaty, of, the, triple, alliance, britain, at, the, time, already, was, increasing, their, imports, of, egyptian, and, indian, cotton, and, as, such, did, not, need, any, from, paraguay, william, doria, the, british, charg, d, affaires, in, paraguay, who, briefly, acted, in, thornton, s, place, joined, french, and, italian, diplomats, in, condemning, argentina, s, president, bartolom, mitre, s, involvement, in, uruguay, but, when, thornton, returned, to, the, job, in, december, 1863, doria, threw, his, full, backing, behind, mitre, since, colonial, times, yerba, mate, had, been, a, major, cash, crop, for, paraguay, until, the, war, it, had, generated, significant, revenues, for, the, country, the, war, caused, a, sharp, drop, in, harvesting, of, yerba, mate, in, paraguay, reportedly, by, as, much, as, 95, between, 1865, and, 1867, soldiers, from, all, sides, used, yerba, mate, to, diminish, hunger, pangs, and, alleviate, combat, anxiety, much, of, the, 156, 415, square, kilometers, 60, 392, sq, mi, lost, by, paraguay, to, argentina, and, brazil, was, rich, in, yerba, mate, so, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, brazil, became, the, leading, producer, of, the, crop, foreign, entrepreneurs, entered, the, paraguayan, market, and, took, control, of, its, remaining, yerba, mate, production, and, industry
