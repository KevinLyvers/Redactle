in, southern, germany, which, flourished, from, around, 1200, bc, this, theory, links, the, celts, with, the, iron, age, hallstatt, culture, which, followed, it, c, 1200, 500, bc, named, for, the, rich, grave, finds, in, hallstatt, austria, and, with, the, following, la, t, ne, culture, c, 450, bc, onward, named, after, the, la, t, ne, site, in, switzerland, it, proposes, that, celtic, culture, spread, westward, and, southward, from, these, areas, by, diffusion, or, migration, a, newer, theory, celtic, from, the, west, suggests, proto, celtic, arose, earlier, was, a, lingua, franca, in, the, atlantic, bronze, age, coastal, zone, and, spread, eastward, another, newer, theory, celtic, from, the, centre, suggests, proto, celtic, arose, between, these, two, zones, in, bronze, age, gaul, then, spread, in, various, directions, after, the, celtic, settlement, of, southeast, europe, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, celtic, culture, reached, as, far, east, as, central, anatolia, turkey, the, earliest, undisputed, examples, of, celtic, language, are, the, lepontic, inscriptions, from, the, 6th, century, bc, continental, celtic, languages, are, attested, almost, exclusively, through, inscriptions, and, place, names, insular, celtic, languages, are, attested, from, the, 4th, century, ad, in, ogham, inscriptions, though, they, were, clearly, being, spoken, much, earlier, celtic, literary, tradition, begins, with, old, irish, texts, around, the, 8th, century, ad, elements, of, celtic, mythology, are, recorded, in, early, irish, and, early, welsh, literature, most, written, evidence, of, the, early, celts, comes, from, greco, roman, writers, who, often, grouped, the, celts, as, barbarian, tribes, they, followed, an, ancient, celtic, religion, overseen, by, druids, the, celts, were, often, in, conflict, with, the, romans, such, as, in, the, roman, gallic, wars, the, celtiberian, wars, the, conquest, of, gaul, and, conquest, of, britain, by, the, 1st, century, ad, most, celtic, territories, had, become, part, of, the, roman, empire, by, c, 500, due, to, romanisation, and, the, migration, of, germanic, tribes, celtic, culture, had, mostly, become, restricted, to, ireland, western, and, northern, britain, and, brittany, between, the, 5th, and, 8th, centuries, the, celtic, speaking, communities, in, these, atlantic, regions, emerged, as, a, reasonably, cohesive, cultural, entity, they, had, a, common, linguistic, religious, and, artistic, heritage, that, distinguished, them, from, surrounding, cultures, insular, celtic, culture, diversified, into, that, of, the, gaels, irish, scots, and, manx, and, the, celtic, britons, welsh, cornish, and, bretons, of, the, medieval, and, modern, periods, a, modern, celtic, identity, was, constructed, as, part, of, the, romanticist, celtic, revival, in, britain, ireland, and, other, european, territories, such, as, galicia, today, irish, scottish, gaelic, welsh, and, breton, are, still, spoken, in, parts, of, their, former, territories, while, cornish, and, manx, are, undergoing, a, revival, the, first, recorded, use, of, the, name, celts, as, keltoi, in, ancient, greek, was, by, greek, geographer, hecataeus, of, miletus, in, 517, bc, when, writing, about, a, people, living, near, massilia, modern, marseille, southern, gaul, in, the, fifth, century, bc, herodotus, referred, to, keltoi, living, around, the, source, of, the, danube, and, in, the, far, west, of, europe, the, etymology, of, keltoi, is, unclear, possible, roots, include, indo, european, k, el, to, hide, seen, also, in, old, irish, ceilid, and, modern, welsh, celu, k, el, to, heat, or, kel, to, impel, it, may, come, from, the, celtic, language, linguist, kim, mccone, supports, this, view, and, notes, that, celt, is, found, in, the, names, of, several, ancient, gauls, such, as, celtillus, father, of, vercingetorix, he, suggests, it, meant, the, people, or, descendants, of, the, hidden, one, noting, the, gauls, claimed, descent, from, an, underworld, god, according, to, commentarii, de, bello, gallico, and, linking, it, with, the, germanic, hel, others, view, it, as, a, name, coined, by, greeks, among, them, linguist, patrizia, de, bernardo, stempel, who, suggests, it, meant, the, tall, ones, in, the, first, century, bc, roman, leader, julius, caesar, reported, that, the, gauls, called, themselves, celts, latin, celtae, in, their, own, tongue, thus, whether, it, was, given, to, them, by, others, or, not, it, was, used, by, the, celts, themselves, greek, geographer, strabo, writing, about, gaul, towards, the, end, of, the, first, century, bc, refers, to, the, race, which, is, now, called, both, gallic, and, galatic, though, he, also, uses, celtica, as, another, name, for, gaul, he, reports, celtic, peoples, in, iberia, too, calling, them, celtiberi, and, celtici, pliny, the, elder, noted, the, use, of, celtici, in, lusitania, as, a, tribal, surname, which, epigraphic, findings, have, confirmed, a, latin, name, for, the, gauls, galli, pl, may, come, from, a, celtic, ethnic, name, perhaps, borrowed, into, latin, during, the, celtic, expansion, into, italy, from, the, early, fifth, century, bc, its, root, may, be, proto, celtic, galno, meaning, power, strength, whence, old, irish, gal, boldness, ferocity, welsh, gallu, to, be, able, power, the, greek, name, galatai, latinized, galatae, most, likely, has, the, same, origin, referring, to, the, gauls, who, invaded, southeast, europe, and, settled, in, galatia, the, suffix, atai, might, be, a, greek, inflection, linguist, kim, mccone, suggests, it, comes, from, proto, celtic, galatis, ferocious, furious, and, was, not, originally, an, ethnic, name, but, a, name, for, young, warrior, bands, he, says, if, the, gauls, initial, impact, on, the, mediterranean, world, was, primarily, a, military, one, typically, involving, fierce, young, galat, s, it, would, have, been, natural, for, the, greeks, to, apply, this, name, for, the, type, of, keltoi, that, they, usually, encountered, because, classical, writers, did, not, call, the, inhabitants, of, britain, and, ireland, keltoi, or, celtae, some, scholars, prefer, not, to, use, the, term, for, the, iron, age, inhabitants, of, those, islands, however, they, spoke, celtic, languages, shared, other, cultural, traits, and, roman, historian, tacitus, says, the, britons, resembled, the, gauls, in, customs, and, religion, for, at, least, 1, 000, years, the, name, celt, was, not, used, at, all, and, nobody, called, themselves, celts, or, celtic, until, from, about, 1700, after, the, word, celtic, was, rediscovered, in, classical, texts, it, was, applied, for, the, first, time, to, the, distinctive, culture, history, traditions, language, of, the, modern, celtic, nations, ireland, scotland, wales, cornwall, brittany, and, the, isle, of, man, celt, is, a, modern, english, word, first, attested, in, 1707, in, the, writing, of, edward, lhuyd, whose, work, along, with, that, of, other, late, 17th, century, scholars, brought, academic, attention, to, the, languages, and, history, of, the, early, celtic, inhabitants, of, great, britain, the, english, words, gaul, gauls, pl, and, gaulish, first, recorded, in, the, 16, 17th, centuries, come, from, french, gaule, and, gaulois, a, borrowing, from, frankish, walholant, roman, land, see, gaul, name, the, root, of, which, is, proto, germanic, walha, foreigner, roman, celt, whence, the, english, word, welsh, old, english, w, lis, proto, germanic, walha, comes, from, the, name, of, the, volcae, a, celtic, tribe, who, lived, first, in, southern, germany, and, central, europe, then, migrated, to, gaul, this, means, that, english, gaul, despite, its, superficial, similarity, is, not, actually, derived, from, latin, gallia, which, should, have, produced, jaille, in, french, though, it, does, refer, to, the, same, ancient, region, celtic, refers, to, a, language, family, and, more, generally, means, of, the, celts, or, in, the, style, of, the, celts, several, archaeological, cultures, are, considered, celtic, based, on, unique, sets, of, artefacts, the, link, between, language, and, artefact, is, aided, by, the, presence, of, inscriptions, the, modern, idea, of, a, celtic, cultural, identity, or, celticity, focuses, on, similarities, among, languages, works, of, art, and, classical, texts, and, sometimes, also, among, material, artefacts, social, organisation, homeland, and, mythology, earlier, theories, held, that, these, similarities, suggest, a, common, racial, race, is, contemporarily, an, invalid, epistemolical, and, genetic, concept, origin, for, the, various, celtic, peoples, but, more, recent, theories, hold, that, they, reflect, a, common, cultural, and, linguistic, heritage, more, than, a, genetic, one, celtic, cultures, seem, to, have, been, diverse, with, the, use, of, a, celtic, language, being, the, main, thing, they, had, in, common, today, the, term, celtic, generally, refers, to, the, languages, and, cultures, of, ireland, scotland, wales, cornwall, the, isle, of, man, and, brittany, also, called, the, celtic, nations, these, are, the, regions, where, celtic, languages, are, still, spoken, to, some, extent, the, four, are, irish, scottish, gaelic, welsh, and, breton, plus, two, recent, revivals, cornish, a, brittonic, language, and, manx, a, goidelic, language, there, are, also, attempts, to, reconstruct, cumbric, a, brittonic, language, of, northern, britain, celtic, regions, of, mainland, europe, are, those, whose, residents, claim, a, celtic, heritage, but, where, no, celtic, language, survives, these, include, western, iberia, i, e, portugal, and, north, central, spain, galicia, asturias, cantabria, castile, and, le, n, extremadura, continental, celts, are, the, celtic, speaking, people, of, mainland, europe, and, insular, celts, are, the, celtic, speaking, people, of, the, british, and, irish, islands, and, their, descendants, the, celts, of, brittany, derive, their, language, from, migrating, insular, celts, from, britain, and, so, are, grouped, accordingly, the, celtic, languages, are, a, branch, of, the, indo, european, languages, by, the, time, celts, are, first, mentioned, in, written, records, around, 400, bc, they, were, already, split, into, several, language, groups, and, spread, over, much, of, western, mainland, europe, the, iberian, peninsula, ireland, and, britain, the, languages, developed, into, celtiberian, goidelic, and, brittonic, branches, among, others, the, mainstream, view, during, most, of, the, twentieth, century, is, that, the, celts, and, the, proto, celtic, language, arose, out, of, the, urnfield, culture, of, central, europe, around, 1000, bc, spreading, westward, and, southward, over, the, following, few, hundred, years, the, urnfield, culture, was, preeminent, in, central, europe, during, the, late, bronze, age, circa, 1200, bc, to, 700, bc, the, spread, of, iron, working, led, to, the, hallstatt, culture, c, 800, to, 500, bc, developing, out, of, the, urnfield, culture, in, a, wide, region, north, of, the, alps, the, hallstatt, culture, developed, into, the, la, t, ne, culture, from, about, 450, bc, which, came, to, be, identified, with, celtic, art, in, 1846, johann, georg, ramsauer, unearthed, an, ancient, grave, field, with, distinctive, grave, goods, at, hallstatt, austria, because, the, burials, dated, to, roughly, the, time, when, celts, are, mentioned, near, the, danube, by, herodotus, ramsauer, concluded, that, the, graves, were, celtic, similar, sites, and, artifacts, were, found, over, a, wide, area, which, were, named, the, hallstatt, culture, in, 1857, the, archaeological, site, of, la, t, ne, was, discovered, in, switzerland, the, huge, collection, of, artifacts, had, a, distinctive, style, artifacts, of, this, la, t, ne, style, were, found, elsewhere, in, europe, particularly, in, places, where, people, called, celts, were, known, to, have, lived, and, early, celtic, languages, are, attested, as, a, result, these, items, quickly, became, associated, with, the, celts, so, much, so, that, by, the, 1870s, scholars, began, to, regard, finds, of, the, la, t, ne, as, the, archaeological, expression, of, the, celts, this, cultural, network, was, overrun, by, the, roman, empire, though, traces, of, la, t, ne, style, were, still, seen, in, gallo, roman, artifacts, in, britain, and, ireland, the, la, t, ne, style, survived, precariously, to, re, emerge, in, insular, art, the, urnfield, hallstatt, theory, began, to, be, challenged, in, the, latter, 20th, century, when, it, was, accepted, that, the, oldest, known, celtic, language, inscriptions, were, those, of, lepontic, from, the, 6th, century, bc, and, celtiberian, from, the, 2nd, century, bc, these, were, found, in, northern, italy, and, iberia, neither, of, which, were, part, of, the, hallstatt, nor, la, t, ne, cultures, at, the, time, the, urnfield, hallstatt, theory, was, partly, based, on, ancient, greco, roman, writings, such, as, the, histories, of, herodotus, which, placed, the, celts, at, the, source, of, the, danube, however, stephen, oppenheimer, shows, that, herodotus, seemed, to, believe, the, danube, rose, near, the, pyrenees, which, would, place, the, ancient, celts, in, a, region, which, is, more, in, agreement, with, later, classical, writers, and, historians, i, e, in, gaul, and, iberia, the, theory, was, also, partly, based, on, the, abundance, of, inscriptions, bearing, celtic, personal, names, in, the, eastern, hallstatt, region, noricum, however, patrick, sims, williams, notes, that, these, date, to, the, later, roman, era, and, says, they, suggest, relatively, late, settlement, by, a, celtic, speaking, elite, in, the, late, 20th, century, the, urnfield, hallstatt, theory, began, to, fall, out, of, favour, with, some, scholars, which, was, influenced, by, new, archaeological, finds, celtic, began, to, refer, primarily, to, speakers, of, celtic, languages, rather, than, to, a, single, culture, or, ethnic, group, a, new, theory, suggested, that, celtic, languages, arose, earlier, along, the, atlantic, coast, including, britain, ireland, armorica, and, iberia, long, before, evidence, of, celtic, culture, is, found, in, archaeology, myles, dillon, and, nora, kershaw, chadwick, argued, that, celtic, settlement, of, the, british, isles, might, date, to, the, bell, beaker, culture, of, the, copper, and, bronze, age, from, c, 2750, bc, mart, n, almagro, gorbea, 2001, also, proposed, that, celtic, arose, in, the, 3rd, millennium, bc, suggesting, that, the, spread, of, the, bell, beaker, culture, explained, the, wide, dispersion, of, the, celts, throughout, western, europe, as, well, as, the, variability, of, the, celtic, peoples, using, a, multidisciplinary, approach, alberto, j, lorrio, and, gonzalo, ruiz, zapatero, reviewed, and, built, on, almagro, gorbea, s, work, to, present, a, model, for, the, origin, of, celtic, archaeological, groups, in, iberia, and, proposing, a, rethinking, of, the, meaning, of, celtic, john, t, koch, and, barry, cunliffe, have, developed, this, celtic, from, the, west, theory, it, proposes, that, the, proto, celtic, language, arose, along, the, atlantic, coast, and, was, the, lingua, franca, of, the, atlantic, bronze, age, cultural, network, later, spreading, inland, and, eastward, more, recently, cunliffe, proposes, that, proto, celtic, had, arisen, in, the, atlantic, zone, even, earlier, by, 3000, bc, and, spread, eastwards, with, the, bell, beaker, culture, over, the, following, millennium, his, theory, is, partly, based, on, glottochronology, the, spread, of, ancient, celtic, looking, placenames, and, thesis, that, the, tartessian, language, was, celtic, however, the, proposal, that, tartessian, was, celtic, is, widely, rejected, by, linguists, many, of, whom, regard, it, as, unclassified, celticist, patrick, sims, williams, 2020, notes, that, in, current, scholarship, celt, is, primarily, a, linguistic, label, in, his, celtic, from, the, centre, theory, he, argues, that, the, proto, celtic, language, did, not, originate, in, central, europe, nor, the, atlantic, but, in, between, these, two, regions, he, suggests, that, it, emerged, as, a, distinct, indo, european, dialect, around, the, second, millennium, bc, probably, somewhere, in, gaul, whence, it, spread, in, various, directions, and, at, various, speeds, in, the, first, millennium, bc, sims, williams, says, this, avoids, the, problematic, idea, that, celtic, was, spoken, over, a, vast, area, for, a, very, long, time, yet, somehow, avoided, major, dialectal, splits, and, it, keeps, celtic, fairly, close, to, italy, which, suits, the, view, that, italic, and, celtic, were, in, some, way, linked, the, proto, celtic, language, is, usually, dated, to, the, late, bronze, age, the, earliest, records, of, a, celtic, language, are, the, lepontic, inscriptions, of, cisalpine, gaul, northern, italy, the, oldest, of, which, pre, date, the, la, t, ne, period, other, early, inscriptions, appearing, from, the, early, la, t, ne, period, in, the, area, of, massilia, are, in, gaulish, which, was, written, in, the, greek, alphabet, until, the, roman, conquest, celtiberian, inscriptions, using, their, own, iberian, script, appear, later, after, about, 200, bc, evidence, of, insular, celtic, is, available, only, from, about, 400, ad, in, the, form, of, primitive, irish, ogham, inscriptions, besides, epigraphic, evidence, an, important, source, of, information, on, early, celtic, is, toponymy, place, names, arnaiz, villena, et, al, 2017, demonstrated, that, celtic, related, populations, of, the, european, atlantic, orkney, islands, scottish, irish, british, bretons, basques, galicians, shared, a, common, hla, system, other, genetic, research, does, not, support, the, notion, of, a, significant, genetic, link, between, these, populations, beyond, the, fact, that, they, are, all, west, europeans, early, european, farmers, did, settle, britain, and, all, of, northern, europe, in, the, neolithic, however, recent, genetics, research, has, found, that, between, 2400, and, 2000, bc, over, 90, of, british, dna, was, overturned, by, european, steppe, herders, in, a, migration, that, brought, large, amounts, of, steppe, dna, including, the, r1b, haplogroup, to, western, europe, modern, autosomal, genetic, clustering, is, testament, to, this, fact, as, both, modern, and, iron, age, british, and, irish, samples, cluster, genetically, very, closely, with, other, north, europeans, and, less, so, with, galicians, basques, or, those, from, the, south, of, france, the, concept, that, the, hallstatt, and, la, t, ne, cultures, could, be, seen, not, just, as, chronological, periods, but, as, culture, groups, entities, composed, of, people, of, the, same, ethnicity, and, language, had, started, to, grow, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, the, belief, that, these, culture, groups, could, be, thought, of, in, racial, or, ethnic, terms, was, held, by, gordon, childe, whose, theory, was, influenced, by, the, writings, of, gustaf, kossinna, as, the, 20th, century, progressed, the, ethnic, interpretation, of, la, t, ne, culture, became, more, strongly, rooted, and, any, findings, of, la, t, ne, culture, and, flat, inhumation, cemeteries, were, linked, to, the, celts, and, the, celtic, language, in, various, academic, disciplines, the, celts, were, considered, a, central, european, iron, age, phenomenon, through, the, cultures, of, hallstatt, and, la, t, ne, however, archaeological, finds, from, the, halstatt, and, la, t, ne, culture, were, rare, in, iberia, southwestern, france, northern, and, western, britain, southern, ireland, and, galatia, and, did, not, provide, enough, evidence, for, a, culture, like, that, of, central, europe, it, is, equally, difficult, to, maintain, that, the, origin, of, the, iberian, celts, can, be, linked, to, the, preceding, urnfield, culture, this, has, resulted, in, a, newer, theory, that, introduces, a, proto, celtic, substratum, and, a, process, of, celticisation, having, its, initial, roots, in, the, bronze, age, bell, beaker, culture, the, la, t, ne, culture, developed, and, flourished, during, the, late, iron, age, from, 450, bc, to, the, roman, conquest, in, the, 1st, century, bc, in, eastern, france, switzerland, austria, southwest, germany, the, czech, republic, slovakia, and, hungary, it, developed, out, of, the, hallstatt, culture, without, any, definite, cultural, break, under, the, impetus, of, considerable, mediterranean, influence, from, greek, and, later, etruscan, civilisations, a, shift, of, settlement, centres, took, place, in, the, 4th, century, the, western, la, t, ne, culture, corresponds, to, historical, celtic, gaul, whether, this, means, that, the, whole, of, la, t, ne, culture, can, be, attributed, to, a, unified, celtic, people, is, difficult, to, assess, archaeologists, have, repeatedly, concluded, that, language, and, material, culture, do, not, necessarily, run, parallel, frey, notes, that, in, the, 5th, century, burial, customs, in, the, celtic, world, were, not, uniform, rather, localised, groups, had, their, own, beliefs, which, in, consequence, also, gave, rise, to, distinct, artistic, expressions, thus, while, the, la, t, ne, culture, is, certainly, associated, with, the, gauls, the, presence, of, la, t, ne, artefacts, may, be, due, to, cultural, contact, and, does, not, imply, the, permanent, presence, of, celtic, speakers, the, greek, historian, ephorus, of, cyme, in, asia, minor, writing, in, the, 4th, century, bc, believed, the, celts, came, from, the, islands, off, the, mouth, of, the, rhine, and, were, driven, from, their, homes, by, the, frequency, of, wars, and, the, violent, rising, of, the, sea, polybius, published, a, history, of, rome, about, 150, bc, in, which, he, describes, the, gauls, of, italy, and, their, conflict, with, rome, pausanias, in, the, 2nd, century, ad, says, that, the, gauls, originally, called, celts, live, on, the, remotest, region, of, europe, on, the, coast, of, an, enormous, tidal, sea, posidonius, described, the, southern, gauls, about, 100, bc, though, his, original, work, is, lost, later, writers, such, as, strabo, used, it, the, latter, writing, in, the, early, 1st, century, ad, deals, with, britain, and, gaul, as, well, as, hispania, italy, and, galatia, caesar, wrote, extensively, about, his, gallic, wars, in, 58, 51, bc, diodorus, siculus, wrote, about, the, celts, of, gaul, and, britain, in, his, 1st, century, history, diodorus, siculus, and, strabo, both, suggest, that, the, heartland, of, the, people, they, call, celts, was, in, southern, gaul, the, former, says, that, the, gauls, were, to, the, north, of, the, celts, but, that, the, romans, referred, to, both, as, gauls, linguistically, the, gauls, were, certainly, celts, before, the, discoveries, at, hallstatt, and, la, t, ne, it, was, generally, considered, that, the, celtic, heartland, was, southern, gaul, see, encyclop, dia, britannica, for, 1813, the, romans, knew, the, celts,

century, traditional, scholarship, dealing, with, the, celts, did, acknowledge, their, presence, in, the, iberian, peninsula, as, a, material, culture, relatable, to, the, hallstatt, and, la, t, ne, cultures, however, since, according, to, the, definition, of, the, iron, age, in, the, 19th, century, celtic, populations, were, supposedly, rare, in, iberia, and, did, not, provide, a, cultural, scenario, that, could, easily, be, linked, to, that, of, central, europe, the, presence, of, celtic, culture, in, that, region, was, generally, not, fully, recognised, modern, scholarship, however, has, clearly, proven, that, celtic, presence, and, influences, were, most, substantial, in, what, is, today, spain, and, portugal, with, perhaps, the, highest, settlement, saturation, in, western, europe, particularly, in, the, central, western, and, northern, regions, in, addition, to, gauls, infiltrating, from, the, north, of, the, pyrenees, the, roman, and, greek, sources, mention, celtic, populations, in, three, parts, of, the, iberian, peninsula, the, eastern, part, of, the, meseta, inhabited, by, the, celtiberians, the, southwest, celtici, in, modern, day, alentejo, and, the, northwest, gallaecia, and, asturias, a, modern, scholarly, review, found, several, archaeological, groups, of, celts, in, spain, the, origins, of, the, celtiberians, might, provide, a, key, to, understanding, the, celticisation, process, in, the, rest, of, the, peninsula, the, process, of, celticisation, of, the, southwestern, area, of, the, peninsula, by, the, keltoi, and, of, the, northwestern, area, is, however, not, a, simple, celtiberian, question, recent, investigations, about, the, callaici, and, bracari, in, northwestern, portugal, are, providing, new, approaches, to, understanding, celtic, culture, language, art, and, religion, in, western, iberia, john, t, koch, of, aberystwyth, university, suggested, that, tartessian, inscriptions, of, the, 8th, century, bc, might, be, classified, as, celtic, this, would, mean, that, tartessian, is, the, earliest, attested, trace, of, celtic, by, a, margin, of, more, than, a, century, in, germany, by, the, late, bronze, age, the, urnfield, culture, c, 1300, bc, c, 750, bc, had, replaced, the, bell, beaker, unetice, and, tumulus, cultures, in, central, europe, whilst, the, nordic, bronze, age, had, developed, in, scandinavia, and, northern, germany, the, hallstatt, culture, which, had, developed, from, the, urnfield, culture, was, the, predominant, western, and, central, european, culture, from, the, 12th, to, 8th, centuries, bc, and, during, the, early, iron, age, 8th, to, 6th, centuries, bc, it, was, followed, by, the, la, t, ne, culture, 5th, to, 1st, centuries, bc, the, people, who, had, adopted, these, cultural, characteristics, in, central, and, southern, germany, are, regarded, as, celts, celtic, cultural, centres, developed, in, central, europe, during, the, late, bronze, age, c, 1200, bc, until, 700, bc, some, like, the, heuneburg, the, oldest, city, north, of, the, alps, grew, to, become, important, cultural, centres, of, the, iron, age, in, central, europe, that, maintained, trade, routes, to, the, mediterranean, in, the, 5th, century, bc, the, greek, historian, herodotus, mentioned, a, celtic, city, at, the, danube, pyrene, that, historians, attribute, to, the, heuneburg, beginning, around, 700, bc, or, later, germanic, peoples, germanic, tribes, from, southern, scandinavia, and, northern, germany, expanded, south, and, gradually, replaced, the, celtic, peoples, in, central, europe, the, canegrate, culture, represented, the, first, migratory, wave, of, the, proto, celtic, population, from, the, northwest, part, of, the, alps, that, through, the, alpine, passes, had, already, penetrated, and, settled, in, the, western, po, valley, between, lake, maggiore, and, lake, como, scamozzina, culture, it, has, also, been, proposed, that, a, more, ancient, proto, celtic, presence, can, be, traced, back, to, the, beginning, of, the, middle, bronze, age, when, north, westwern, italy, appears, closely, linked, regarding, the, production, of, bronze, artefacts, including, ornaments, to, the, western, groups, of, the, tumulus, culture, la, t, ne, cultural, material, appeared, over, a, large, area, of, mainland, italy, the, southernmost, example, being, the, celtic,

italy, from, the, alps, to, umbria, according, to, the, recueil, des, inscriptions, gauloises, more, than, 760, gaulish, inscriptions, have, been, found, throughout, present, day, france, with, the, notable, exception, of, aquitaine, and, in, italy, which, testifies, the, importance, of, celtic, heritage, in, the, peninsula, in, 391, bc, celts, who, had, their, homes, beyond, the, alps, streamed, through, the, passes, in, great, strength, and, seized, the, territory, that, lay, between, the, apennine, mountains, and, the, alps, according, to, diodorus, siculus, the, po, valley, and, the, rest, of, northern, italy, known, to, the, romans, as, cisalpine, gaul, was, inhabited, by, celtic, speakers, who, founded, cities, such, as, milan, later, the, roman, army, was, routed, at, the, battle, of, allia, and, rome, was, sacked, in, 390, bc, by, the, senones, at, the, battle, of, telamon, in, 225, bc, a, large, celtic, army, was, trapped, between, two, roman, forces, and, crushed, the,

bulgaria, which, reflects, their, ethnonym, they, would, have, established, themselves, in, this, area, during, the, celtic, migrations, at, the, end, of, the, 4th, century, bc, though, there, is, no, evidence, for, their, existence, before, the, 1st, century, bc, serdi, are, among, traditional, tribal, names, reported, into, the, roman, era, they, were, gradually, thracianized, over, the, centuries, but, retained, their, celtic, character, in, material, culture, up, to, a, late, date, according, to, other, sources, they, may, have, been, simply, of, thracian, origin, according, to, others, they, may, have, become, of, mixed, thraco, celtic, origin, further, south, celts, settled, in, thrace, bulgaria, which, they, ruled, for, over, a, century, and, anatolia, where, they, settled, as, the, galatians, see, also, gallic, invasion, of, greece, despite, their, geographical, isolation, from, the, rest, of, the, celtic, world, the, galatians, maintained, their, celtic, language, for, at, least, 700, years, st, jerome, who, visited, ancyra, modern, day, ankara, in, 373, ad, likened, their, language, to, that, of, the, treveri, of, northern, gaul, for, venceslas, kruta, galatia, in, central, turkey, was, an, area, of, dense, celtic, settlement, the, boii, tribe, gave, their, name, to, bohemia, bologna, and, possibly, bavaria, and, celtic, artefacts, and, cemeteries, have, been, discovered, further, east, in, what, is, now, poland, and, slovakia, a, celtic, coin, biatec, from, bratislava, s, mint, was, displayed, on, the, old, slovak, 5, crown, coin, as, there, is, no, archaeological, evidence, for, large, scale, invasions, in, some, of, the, other, areas, one, current, school, of, thought, holds, that, celtic, language, and, culture, spread, to, those, areas, by, contact, rather, than, invasion, however, the, celtic, invasions, of, italy, and, the, expedition, in, greece, and, western, anatolia, are, well, documented, in, greek, and, latin, history, there, are, records, of, celtic, mercenaries, in, egypt, serving, the, ptolemies, thousands, were, employed, in, 283, 246, bc, and, they, were, also, in, service, around, 186, bc, they, attempted, to, overthrow, ptolemy, ii, all, living, celtic, languages, today, belong, to, the, insular, celtic, languages, derived, from, the, celtic, languages, spoken, in, iron, age, britain, and, ireland, they, separated, into, a, goidelic, and, a, brittonic, branch, early, on, by, the, time, of, the, roman, conquest, of, britain, in, the, 1st, century, ad, the, insular, celts, were, made, up, of, the, celtic, britons, the, gaels, or, scoti, and, the, picts, or, caledonians, the, renown, of, insular, celts, has, caused, a, popular, belief, that, celtic, clans, only, lived, in, the, british, isles, linguists, have, debated, whether, a, celtic, language, came, to, the, british, isles, and, then, split, or, whether, the, two, branches, arrived, separately, the, older, view, was, that, celtic, influence, in, the, isles, was, the, result, of, successive, migrations, or, invasions, from, the, european, mainland, by, diverse, celtic, speaking, peoples, over, several, centuries, accounting, for, the, p, celtic, vs, q, celtic, isogloss, this, view, has, been, challenged, by, the, hypothesis, that, the, islands, celtic, languages, form, an, insular, celtic, dialect, group, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, scholars, often, dated, the, arrival, of, celtic, culture, in, britain, via, an, invasion, model, to, the, 6th, century, bc, corresponding, to, archaeological, evidence, of, hallstatt, influence, and, the, appearance, of, chariot, burials, in, what, is, now, england, cunliffe, and, koch, propose, in, their, newer, celtic, from, the, west, theory, that, celtic, languages, reached, the, isles, earlier, with, the, bell, beaker, culture, c, 2500, bc, or, even, before, this, more, recently, a, major, archaeogenetics, study, uncovered, a, migration, into, southern, britain, in, the, bronze, age, from, 1300, to, 800, bc, the, newcomers, were, genetically, most, similar, to, ancient, individuals, from, gaul, from, 1000, bc, their, genetic, marker, swiftly, spread, through, southern, britain, but, not, northern, britain, the, authors, see, this, as, a, plausible, vector, for, the, spread, of, early, celtic, languages, into, britain, there, was, much, less, immigration, during, the, iron, age, so, it, is, likely, that, celtic, reached, britain, before, then, cunliffe, suggests, that, a, branch, of, celtic, was, already, spoken, in, britain, and, the, bronze, age, migration, introduced, the, brittonic, branch, like, many, celtic, peoples, on, the, mainland, the, insular, celts, followed, an, ancient, celtic, religion, overseen, by, druids, some, of, the, southern, british, tribes, had, strong, links, with, gaul, and, belgica, and, minted, their, own, coins, during, the, roman, occupation, of, britain, a, romano, british, culture, emerged, in, the, southeast, the, britons, and, picts, in, the, north, and, the, gaels, of, ireland, remained, outside, the, empire, during, the, end, of, roman, rule, in, britain, in, the, 400s, ad, there, was, significant, anglo, saxon, settlement, of, eastern, and, southern, britain, and, some, gaelic, settlement, of, its, western, coast, during, this, time, some, britons, migrated, to, the, armorican, peninsula, where, their, culture, became, dominant, meanwhile, much, of, northern, britain, scotland, became, gaelic, by, the, 10th, century, ad, the, insular, celtic, peoples, had, diversified, into, the, brittonic, speaking, welsh, in, wales, cornish, in, cornwall, bretons, in, brittany, and, cumbrians, in, the, old, north, and, the, gaelic, speaking, irish, in, ireland, scots, in, scotland, and, manx, on, the, isle, of, man, classical, writers, did, not, call, the, inhabitants, of, britain, and, ireland, celtae, or, keltoi, leading, some, scholars, to, question, the, use, of, the, term, celt, for, the, iron, age, inhabitants, of, those, islands, the, first, historical, account, of, the, islands, was, by, the, greek, geographer, pytheas, who, sailed, around, what, he, called, the, pretannikai, nesoi, the, pretannic, isles, around, 310, 306, bc, in, general, classical, writers, referred, to, the, britons, as, pretannoi, in, greek, or, britanni, in, latin, strabo, writing, in, roman, times, distinguished, between, the, celts, and, britons, however, roman, historian, tacitus, says, the, britons, resembled, the, celts, of, gaul, in, customs, and, religion, under, caesar, the, romans, conquered, celtic, gaul, and, from, claudius, onward, the, roman, empire, absorbed, parts, of, britain, roman, local, government, of, these, regions, closely, mirrored, pre, roman, tribal, boundaries, and, archaeological, finds, suggest, native, involvement, in, local, government, the, native, peoples, under, roman, rule, became, romanised, and, keen, to, adopt, roman, ways, celtic, art, had, already, incorporated, classical, influences, and, surviving, gallo, roman, pieces, interpret, classical, subjects, or, keep, faith, with, old, traditions, despite, a, roman, overlay, the, roman, occupation, of, gaul, and, to, a, lesser, extent, of, britain, led, to, roman, celtic, syncretism, in, the, case, of, the, continental, celts, this, eventually, resulted, in, a, language, shift, to, vulgar, latin, while, the, insular, celts, retained, their, language, there, was, also, considerable, cultural, influence, exerted, by, gaul, on, rome, particularly, in, military, matters, and, horsemanship, as, the, gauls, often, served, in, the, roman, cavalry, the, romans, adopted, the, celtic, cavalry, sword, the, spatha, and, epona, the, celtic, horse, goddess, to, the, extent, that, sources, are, available, they, depict, a, pre, christian, iron, age, celtic, social, structure, based, formally, on, class, and, kingship, although, this, may, only, have, been, a, particular, late, phase, of, organisation, in, celtic, societies, patron, client, relationships, similar, to, those, of, roman, society, are, also, described, by, caesar, and, others, in, the, gaul, of, the, 1st, century, bc, in, the, main, the, evidence, is, of, tribes, being, led, by, kings, although, some, argue, that, there, is, also, evidence, of, oligarchical, republican, forms, of, government, eventually, emerging, in, areas, which, had, close, contact, with, rome, most, descriptions, of, celtic, societies, portray, them, as, being, divided, into, three, groups, a, warrior, aristocracy, an, intellectual, class, including, professions, such, as, druid, poet, and, jurist, and, everyone, else, in, historical, times, the, offices, of, high, and, low, kings, in, ireland, and, scotland, were, filled, by, election, under, the, system, of, tanistry, which, eventually, came, into, conflict, with, the, feudal, principle, of, primogeniture, in, which, succession, goes, to, the, first, born, son, little, is, known, of, family, structure, among, the, celts, patterns, of, settlement, varied, from, decentralised, to, urban, the, popular, stereotype, of, non, urbanised, societies, settled, in, hillforts, and, duns, drawn, from, britain, and, ireland, there, are, about, 3, 000, hill, forts, known, in, britain, contrasts, with, the, urban, settlements, present, in, the, core, hallstatt, and, la, t, ne, areas, with, the, many, significant, oppida, of, gaul, late, in, the, first, millennium, bc, and, with, the, towns, of, gallia, cisalpina, slavery, as, practised, by, the, celts, was, very, likely, similar, to, the, better, documented, practice, in, ancient, greece, and, rome, slaves, were, acquired, from, war, raids, and, penal, and, debt, servitude, slavery, was, hereditary, though, manumission, was, possible, the, old, irish, and, welsh, words, for, slave, cacht, and, caeth, respectively, are, cognate, with, latin, captus, captive, suggesting, that, the, slave, trade, was, an, early, means, of, contact, between, latin, and, celtic, societies, in, the, middle, ages, slavery, was, especially, prevalent, in, the, celtic, countries, manumissions, were, discouraged, by, law, and, the, word, for, female, slave, cumal, was, used, as, a, general, unit, of, value, in, ireland, there, are, only, very, limited, records, from, pre, christian, times, written, in, celtic, languages, these, are, mostly, inscriptions, in, the, roman, and, sometimes, greek, alphabets, the, ogham, script, an, early, medieval, alphabet, was, mostly, used, in, early, christian, times, in, ireland, and, scotland, but, also, in, wales, and, england, and, was, only, used, for, ceremonial, purposes, such, as, inscriptions, on, gravestones, the, available, evidence, is, of, a, strong, oral, tradition, such, as, that, preserved, by, bards, in, ireland, and, eventually, recorded, by, monasteries, celtic, art, also, produced, a, great, deal, of, intricate, and, beautiful, metalwork, examples, of, which, have, been, preserved, by, their, distinctive, burial, rites, in, some, regards, the, atlantic, celts, were, conservative, for, example, they, still, used, chariots, in, combat, long, after, they, had, been, reduced, to, ceremonial, roles, by, the, greeks, and, romans, however, despite, being, outdated, celtic, chariot, tactics, were, able, to, repel, the, invasions, of, britain, attempted, by, julius, caesar, according, to, diodorus, siculus, the, gauls, are, tall, of, body, with, rippling, muscles, and, white, of, skin, and, their, hair, is, blond, and, not, only, naturally, so, for, they, also, make, it, their, practice, by, artificial, means, to, increase, the, distinguishing, colour, which, nature, has, given, it, for, they, are, always, washing, their, hair, in, limewater, and, they, pull, it, back, from, the, forehead, to, the, nape, of, the, neck, with, the, result, that, their, appearance, is, like, that, of, satyrs, and, pans, since, the, treatment, of, their, hair, makes, it, so, heavy, and, coarse, that, it, differs, in, no, respect, from, the, mane, of, horses, some, of, them, shave, the, beard, but, others, let, it, grow, a, little, and, the, nobles, shave, their, cheeks, but, they, let, the, moustache, grow, until, it, covers, the, mouth, during, the, later, iron, age, the, gauls, generally, wore, long, sleeved, shirts, or, tunics, and, long, trousers, called, braccae, by, the, romans, clothes, were, made, of, wool, or, linen, with, some, silk, being, used, by, the, rich, cloaks, were, worn, in, the, winter, brooches, and, armlets, were, used, but, the, most, famous, item, of, jewellery, was, the, torc, a, neck, collar, of, metal, sometimes, gold, the, horned, waterloo, helmet, in, the, british, museum, which, long, set, the, standard, for, modern, images, of, celtic, warriors, is, in, fact, a, unique, survival, and, may, have, been, a, piece, for, ceremonial, rather, than, military, wear, archaeological, evidence, suggests, that, the, pre, roman, celtic, societies, were, linked, to, the, network, of, overland, trade, routes, that, spanned, eurasia, archaeologists, have, discovered, large, prehistoric, trackways, crossing, bogs, in, ireland, and, germany, due, to, their, substantial, nature, these, are, believed, to, have, been, created, for, wheeled, transport, as, part, of, an, extensive, roadway, system, that, facilitated, trade, the, territory, held, by, the, celts, contained, tin, lead, iron, silver, and, gold, celtic, smiths, and, metalworkers, created, weapons, and, jewellery, for, international, trade, particularly, with, the, romans, the, myth, that, the, celtic, monetary, system, consisted, of, wholly, barter, is, a, common, one, but, is, in, part, false, the, monetary, system, was, complex, and, is, still, not, understood, much, like, the, late, roman, coinages, and, due, to, the, absence, of, large, numbers, of, coin, items, it, is, assumed, that, proto, money, was, used, this, included, bronze, items, made, from, the, early, la, t, ne, period, and, onwards, which, were, often, in, the, shape, of, axeheads, rings, or, bells, due, to, the, large, number, of, these, present, in, some, burials, it, is, thought, they, had, a, relatively, high, monetary, value, and, could, be, used, for, day, to, day, purchases, low, value, coinages, of, potin, a, bronze, alloy, with, high, tin, content, were, minted, in, most, celtic, areas, of, the, continent, and, in, south, east, britain, prior, to, the, roman, conquest, of, these, lands, higher, value, coinages, suitable, for, use, in, trade, were, minted, in, gold, silver, and, high, quality, bronze, gold, coinage, was, much, more, common, than, silver, coinage, despite, being, worth, substantially, more, as, while, there, were, around, 100, mines, in, southern, britain, and, central, france, silver, was, more, rarely, mined, this, was, due, partly, to, the, relative, sparsity, of, mines, and, the, amount, of, effort, needed, for, extraction, compared, to, the, profit, gained, as, the, roman, civilisation, grew, in, importance, and, expanded, its, trade, with, the, celtic, world, silver, and, bronze, coinage, became, more, common, this, coincided, with, a, major, increase, in, gold, production, in, celtic, areas, to, meet, the, roman, demand, due, to, the, high, value, romans, put, on, the, metal, the, large, number, of, gold, mines, in, france, is, thought, to, be, a, major, reason, why, caesar, invaded, very, few, reliable, sources, exist, regarding, celtic, views, on, gender, roles, though, some, archaeological, evidence, suggests, their, views, may, have, differed, from, those, of, the, greco, roman, world, which, tended, to, be, less, egalitarian, some, iron, age, burials, in, northeastern, gaul, suggest, women, may, have, had, roles, in, warfare, during, the, earlier, la, t, ne, period, but, the, evidence, is, far, from, conclusive, celtic, individuals, buried, with, both, female, jewellery, and, weaponry, have, been, found, such, as, the, vix, grave, in, northeastern, gaul, and, there, are, questions, about, the, gender, of, some, individuals, buried, with, weaponry, however, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, weapons, indicate, high, social, rank, rather, than, masculinity, most, written, accounts, of, the, ancient, celts, are, from, the, romans, and, greeks, though, it, is, not, clear, how, accurate, these, are, roman, historians, ammianus, marcellinus, and, tacitus, mentioned, celtic, women, inciting, participating, in, and, leading, battles, plutarch, reports, that, celtic, women, acted, as, ambassadors, to, avoid, a, war, among, celtic, chiefdoms, in, the, po, valley, during, the, 4th, century, bc, posidonius, anthropological, comments, on, the, celts, had, common, themes, primarily, primitivism, extreme, ferocity, cruel, sacrificial, practices, and, the, strength, and, courage, of, their, women, cassius, dio, suggests, there, was, great, sexual, freedom, among, women, in, celtic, britain, a, very, witty, remark, is, reported, to, have, been, made, by, the, wife, of, argentocoxus, a, caledonian, to, julia, augusta, when, the, empress, was, jesting, with, her, after, the, treaty, about, the, free, intercourse, of, her, sex, with, men, in, britain, she, replied, we, fulfill, the, demands, of, nature, in, a, much, better, way, than, do, you, roman, women, for, we, consort, openly, with, the, best, men, whereas, you, let, yourselves, be, debauched, in, secret, by, the, vilest, such, was, the, retort, of, the, british, woman, barry, cunliffe, writes, that, such, references, are, likely, to, be, ill, observed, and, meant, to, portray, the, celts, as, outlandish, barbarians, historian, lisa, bitel, argues, the, descriptions, of, celtic, women, warriors, are, not, credible, she, says, some, roman, and, greek, writers, wanted, to, show, that, the, barbarian, celts, lived, in, an, upside, down, world, and, a, standard, ingredient, in, such, a, world, was, the, manly, warrior, woman, the, greek, philosopher, aristotle, wrote, in, his, politics, that, the, celts, of, southeastern, europe, approved, of, male, homosexuality, greek, historian, diodorus, siculus, wrote, in, his, bibliotheca, historica, that, although, gaulish, women, were, beautiful, the, men, had, little, to, do, with, them, and, it, was, a, custom, for, men, to, sleep, on, animal, skins, with, two, younger, males, he, further, claimed, that, the, young, men, will, offer, themselves, to, strangers, and, are, insulted, if, the, offer, is, refused, his, claim, was, later, repeated, by, greco, roman, writers, athenaeus, and, ammianus, david, rankin, in, celts, and, the, classical, world, suggests, some, of, these, claims, refer, to, bonding, rituals, in, warrior, groups, which, required, abstinence, from, women, at, certain, times, and, says, it, probably, reflects, the, warlike, character, of, early, contacts, between, the, celts, and, the, greeks, under, brehon, law, which, was, written, down, in, early, medieval, ireland, after, conversion, to, christianity, a, woman, had, the, right, to, divorce, her, husband, and, gain, his, property, if, he, was, unable, to, perform, his, marital, duties, due, to, impotence, obesity, homosexual, inclination, or, preference, for, other, women, celtic, art, is, generally, used, by, art, historians, to, refer, to, art, of, the, la, t, ne, period, across, europe, while, the, early, medieval, art, of, britain, and, ireland, that, is, what, celtic, art, evokes, for, much, of, the, general, public, is, called, insular, art, in, art, history, both, styles, absorbed, considerable, influences, from, non, celtic, sources, but, retained, a, preference, for, geometrical, decoration, over, figurative, subjects, which, are, often, extremely, stylised, when, they, do, appear, narrative, scenes, only, appear, under, outside, influence, energetic, circular, forms, triskeles, and, spirals, are, characteristic, much, of, the, surviving, material, is, in, precious, metal, which, no, doubt, gives, a, very, unrepresentative, picture, but, apart, from, pictish, stones, and, the, insular, high, crosses, large, monumental, sculpture, even, with, decorative, carving, is, very, rare, possibly, it, was, originally, common, in, wood, celts, were, also, able, to, create, developed, musical, instruments, such, as, the, carnyces, these, famous, war, trumpets, used, before, the, battle, to, frighten, the, enemy, as, the, best, preserved, found, in, tintignac, gaul, in, 2004, and, which, were, decorated, with, a, boar, head, or, a, snake, head, the, interlace, patterns, that, are, often, regarded, as, typical, of, celtic, art, were, characteristic, of, the, whole, of, the, british, isles, a, style, referred, to, as, insular, art, or, hiberno, saxon, art, this, artistic, style, incorporated, elements, of, la, t, ne, late, roman, and, most, importantly, animal, style, ii, of, germanic, migration, period, art, the, style, was, taken, up, with, great, skill, and, enthusiasm, by, celtic, artists, in, metalwork, and, illuminated, manuscripts, equally, the, forms, used, for, the, finest, insular, art, were, all, adopted, from, the, roman, world, gospel, books, like, the, book, of, kells, and, book, of, lindisfarne, chalices, like, the, ardagh, chalice, and, derrynaflan, chalice, and, penannular, brooches, like, the, tara, brooch, and, roscrea, brooch, these, works, are, from, the, period, of, peak, achievement, of, insular, art, which, lasted, from, the, 7th, to, the, 9th, centuries, before, the, viking, attacks, sharply, set, back, cultural, life, in, contrast, the, less, well, known, but, often, spectacular, art, of, the, richest, earlier, continental, celts, before, they, were, conquered, by, the, romans, often, adopted, elements, of, roman, greek, and, other, foreign, styles, and, possibly, used, imported, craftsmen, to, decorate, objects, that, were, distinctively, celtic, after, the, roman, conquests, some, celtic, elements, remained, in, popular, art, especially, ancient, roman, pottery, of, which, gaul, was, actually, the, largest, producer, mostly, in, italian, styles, but, also, producing, work, in, local, taste, including, figurines, of, deities, and, wares, painted, with, animals, and, other, subjects, in, highly, formalised, styles, roman, britain, also, took, more, interest, in, enamel, than, most, of, the, empire, and, its, development, of, champlev, technique, was, probably, important, to, the, later, medieval, art, of, the, whole, of, europe, of, which, the, energy, and, freedom, of, insular, decoration, was, an, important, element, rising, nationalism, brought, celtic, revivals, from, the, 19th, century, the, coligny, calendar, which, was, found, in, 1897, in, coligny, ain, was, engraved, on, a, bronze, tablet, preserved, in, 73, fragments, that, originally, was, 1, 48, metres, 4, feet, 10, inches, wide, and, 0, 9, metres, 2, feet, 11, inches, high, lambert, p, 111, based, on, the, style, of, lettering, and, the, accompanying, objects, it, probably, dates, to, the, end, of, the, 2nd, century, it, is, written, in, latin, inscriptional, capitals, and, is, in, gaulish, the, restored, tablet, contains, 16, vertical, columns, with, 62, months, distributed, over, 5, years, french, archaeologist, j, monard, speculated, that, it, was, recorded, by, druids, wishing, to, preserve, their, tradition, of, timekeeping, in, a, time, when, the, julian, calendar, was, imposed, throughout, the, roman, empire, however, the, general, form, of, the, calendar, suggests, the, public, peg, calendars, or, parapegmata, found, throughout, the, greek, and, roman, world, tribal, warfare, appears, to, have, been, a, regular, feature, of, celtic, societies, while, epic, literature, depicts, this, as, more, of, a, sport, focused, on, raids, and, hunting, rather, than, organised, territorial, conquest, the, historical, record, is, more, of, tribes, using, warfare, to, exert, political, control, and, harass, rivals, for, economic, advantage, and, in, some, instances, to, conquer, territory, the, celts, were, described, by, classical, writers, such, as, strabo, livy, pausanias, and, florus, as, fighting, like, wild, beasts, and, as, hordes, dionysius, said, that, their, manner, of, fighting, being, in, large, measure, that, of, wild, beasts, and, frenzied, was, an, erratic, procedure, quite, lacking, in, military, science, thus, at, one, moment, they, would, raise, their, swords, aloft, and, smite, after, the, manner, of, wild, boars, throwing, the, whole, weight, of, their, bodies, into, the, blow, like, hewers, of, wood, or, men, digging, with, mattocks, and, again, they, would, deliver, crosswise, blows, aimed, at, no, target, as, if, they, intended, to, cut, to, pieces, the, entire, bodies, of, their, adversaries, protective, armour, and, all, such, descriptions, have, been, challenged, polybius, 2, 33, indicates, that, the, principal, celtic, weapon, was, a, long, bladed, sword, which, was, used, for, hacking, edgewise, rather, than, stabbing, celtic, warriors, are, described, by, polybius, and, plutarch, as, frequently, having, to, cease, fighting, in, order, to, straighten, their, sword, blades, this, claim, has, been, questioned, by, some, archaeologists, who, note, that, noric, steel, steel, produced, in, celtic, noricum, was, famous, in, the, roman, empire, period, and, was, used, to, equip, the, roman, military, however, radomir, pleiner, in, the, celtic, sword, 1993, argues, that, the, metallographic, evidence, shows, that, polybius, was, right, up, to, a, point, as, around, one, third, of, surviving, swords, from, the, period, might, well, have, behaved, as, he, describes, in, addition, to, these, long, bladed, slashing, swords, spears, and, specialized, javelins, were, also, used, polybius, also, asserts, that, certain, of, the, celts, fought, naked, the, appearance, of, these, naked, warriors, was, a, terrifying, spectacle, for, they, were, all, men, of, splendid, physique, and, in, the, prime, of, life, according, to, livy, this, was, also, true, of, the, celts, of, asia, minor, celts, had, a, reputation, as, head, hunters, paul, jacobsthal, says, amongst, the, celts, the, human, head, was, venerated, above, all, else, since, the, head, was, to, the, celt, the, soul, centre, of, the, emotions, as, well, as, of, life, itself, a, symbol, of, divinity, and, of, the, powers, of, the, other, world, writing, in, the, first, century, bc, greek, historians, posidonius, and, diodorus, siculus, said, celtic, warriors, cut, off, the, heads, of, enemies, slain, in, battle, hung, them, from, the, necks, of, their, horses, then, nailed, them, up, outside, their, homes, strabo, wrote, in, the, same, century, that, celts, embalmed, the, heads, of, their, most, esteemed, enemies, in, cedar, oil, and, put, them, on, display, roman, historian, livy, wrote, that, the, boii, beheaded, a, defeated, roman, general, after, the, battle, of, silva, litana, covered, his, skull, in, gold, and, used, it, as, a, ritual, cup, archaeologists, have, found, evidence, that, heads, were, embalmed, and, displayed, by, the, southern, gauls, in, another, example, at, the, southern, gaulish, site, of, entremont, there, stood, a, pillar, carved, with, skulls, within, which, were, niches, where, human, skulls, were, kept, nailed, into, position, roquepertuse, nearby, has, similar, carved, heads, and, skull, niches, many, lone, carved, heads, have, been, found, in, celtic, regions, some, with, two, or, three, faces, examples, include, the, m, eck, ehrovice, head, and, the, corleck, head, severed, heads, are, a, common, motif, in, insular, celtic, myths, and, there, are, many, tales, in, which, living, heads, preside, over, feasts, or, speak, prophecies, the, beheading, game, is, a, motif, in, irish, myth, and, arthurian, legend, most, famously, in, the, tale, sir, gawain, and, the, green, knight, where, the, green, knight, picks, up, his, own, severed, head, after, gawain, has, struck, it, off, there, are, also, many, legends, in, celtic, regions, of, saints, who, carry, their, own, severed, heads, in, irish, myth, the, severed, heads, of, warriors, are, called, the, mast, or, nuts, of, the, goddess, macha, like, other, european, iron, age, societies, the, celts, practised, a, polytheistic, religion, and, believed, in, an, afterlife, celtic, religion, varied, by, region, and, over, time, but, had, broad, structural, similarities, and, there, was, a, basic, religious, homogeneity, among, the, celtic, peoples, because, the, ancient, celts, did, not, have, writing, evidence, about, their, religion, is, gleaned, from, archaeology, greco, roman, accounts, and, literature, from, the, early, christian, period, the, names, of, over, two, hundred, celtic, deities, have, survived, see, list, of, celtic, deities, although, it, is, likely, that, many, of, these, were, alternative, names, regional, names, or, titles, for, the, same, deity, some, deities, were, venerated, only, in, one, region, but, others, were, more, widely, known, according, to, miranda, aldhouse, green, the, celts, were, also, animists, believing, that, every, part, of, the, natural, world, had, a, spirit, the, celts, seem, to, have, had, a, father, god, who, was, often, a, god, of, the, tribe, and, of, the, dead, toutatis, probably, being, one, name, for, him, and, a, mother, goddess, who, was, associated, with, the, land, earth, and, fertility, dea, matrona, probably, being, one, name, for, her, the, mother, goddess, could, also, take, the, form, of, a, war, goddess, as, protectress, of, her, tribe, and, its, land, there, also, seems, to, have, been, a, male, celestial, god, identified, with, taranis, associated, with, thunder, the, wheel, and, the, bull, there, were, gods, of, skill, and, craft, such, as, the, pan, regional, god, lugus, and, the, smith, god, gobannos, celtic, healing, deities, were, often, associated, with, sacred, springs, such, as, sirona, and, borvo, other, pan, regional, deities, include, the, horned, god, cernunnos, the, horse, and, fertility, goddess, epona, the, divine, son, maponos, as, well, as, belenos, ogmios, and, sucellos, caesar, says, the, gauls, believed, they, all, descended, from, a, god, of, the, dead, and, underworld, triplicity, is, a, common, theme, in, celtic, cosmology, and, a, number, of, deities, were, seen, as, threefold, for, example, the, three, mothers, celtic, religious, ceremonies, were, overseen, by, priests, known, as, druids, who, also, served, as, judges, teachers, and, lore, keepers, other, classes, of, druids, performed, sacrifices, for, the, perceived, benefit, of, the, community, there, is, evidence, that, ancient, celtic, peoples, sacrificed, animals, almost, always, livestock, or, working, animals, it, appears, some, were, offered, wholly, to, the, gods, by, burying, or, burning, while, some, were, shared, between, gods, and, humans, part, eaten, and, part, offered, there, is, also, some, evidence, that, ancient, celts, sacrificed, humans, and, some, greco, roman, sources, claim, the, gauls, sacrificed, criminals, by, burning, them, in, a, wicker, man, the, romans, said, the, celts, held, ceremonies, in, sacred, groves, and, other, natural, shrines, called, nemetons, some, celtic, peoples, built, temples, or, ritual, enclosures, of, varying, shapes, such, as, the, romano, celtic, temple, and, viereckschanze, though, they, also, maintained, shrines, at, natural, sites, celtic, peoples, often, made, votive, offerings, treasured, items, deposited, in, water, and, wetlands, or, in, ritual, shafts, and, wells, often, in, the, same, place, over, generations, modern, clootie, wells, might, be, a, continuation, of, this, most, surviving, celtic, mythology, belongs, to, the, insular, celtic, peoples, irish, mythology, has, the, largest, written, body, of, myths, followed, by, welsh, mythology, these, were, written, down, in, the, early, middle, ages, mainly, by, christian, scribes, the, supernatural, race, called, the, tuatha, d, danann, are, believed, to, represent, the, main, celtic, gods, of, ireland, their, traditional, rivals, are, the, fom, ire, whom, they, defeat, in, the, battle, of, mag, tuired, barry, cunliffe, says, the, underlying, structure, in, irish, myth, was, a, dualism, between, the, male, tribal, god, and, the, female, goddess, of, the, land, the, dagda, seems, to, have, been, the, chief, god, and, the, morr, gan, his, consort, each, of, whom, had, other, names, one, common, motif, is, the, sovereignty, goddess, who, represents, the, land, and, bestows, sovereignty, on, a, king, by, marrying, him, the, goddess, brigid, was, linked, with, nature, as, well, as, poetry, healing, and, smithing, some, figures, in, medieval, insular, celtic, myth, have, ancient, continental, parallels, irish, lugh, and, welsh, lleu, are, cognate, with, lugus, goibniu, and, gofannon, with, gobannos, mac, n, and, mabon, with, maponos, while, macha, and, rhiannon, may, be, counterparts, of, epona, in,

many, changes, in, celtic, religion, the, most, noticeable, of, which, was, the, weakening, of, the, druid, class, especially, religiously, the, druids, were, to, eventually, disappear, altogether, romano, celtic, deities, also, began, to, appear, these, deities, often, had, both, roman, and, celtic, attributes, combined, the, names, of, roman, and, celtic, deities, or, included, couples, with,

northern, and, eastern, gaul, another, major, change, in, religious, practice, was, the, use, of, stone, monuments, to, represent, gods, and, goddesses, the, celts, had, probably, only, created, wooden, cult, images, including, monuments, carved, into, trees, which, were, known, as, sacred, poles, before, the, roman, conquest, while, the, regions, under, roman, rule, adopted, christianity,

an, increase, in, north, central, european, ancestry, in, iberia, and, may, be, connected, to, the, expansion, of, the, urnfield, culture, the, paternal, haplogroup, haplogroup, i2a1a1a, has, been,
