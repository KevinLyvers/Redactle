human, history, is, the, record, of, humankind, from, prehistory, to, the, present, modern, humans, evolved, in, africa, around, 300, 000, years, ago, and, initially, lived, as, hunter, gatherers, they, migrated, out, of, africa, during, the, last, ice, age, and, had, populated, most, of, the, earth, by, the, end, of, the, ice, age, 12, 000, years, ago, soon, afterward, the, neolithic, revolution, in, west, asia, brought, the, first, systematic, husbandry, of, plants, and, animals, and, saw, many, humans, transition, from, a, nomadic, life, to, a, sedentary, existence, as, farmers, in, permanent, settlements, the, growing, complexity, of, human, societies, necessitated, systems, of, accounting, and, writing, these, developments, paved, the, way, for, the, emergence, of, early, civilizations, in, mesopotamia, egypt, the, indus, valley, and, china, marking, the, beginning, of, the, ancient, period, in, 3500, bce, these, civilizations, supported, the, establishment, of, regional, empires, and, acted, as, a, fertile, ground, for, the, advent, of, transformative, philosophical, and, religious, ideas, initially, hinduism, during, the, late, bronze, age, and, later, buddhism, confucianism, greek, philosophy, jainism, judaism, taoism, and, zoroastrianism, during, the, axial, age, the, following, post, classical, period, from, about, 500, to, 1500, ce, witnessed, the, rise, of, islam, and, the, continued, spread, and, consolidation, of, christianity, while, civilization, expanded, to, new, parts, of, the, world, and, trade, between, societies, increased, these, developments, were, accompanied, by, the, rise, and, decline, of, major, empires, such, as, the, byzantine, empire, the, islamic, caliphates, the, mongol, empire, and, various, chinese, dynasties, this, period, s, invention, of, gunpowder, and, of, the, printing, press, greatly, affected, subsequent, history, during, the, early, modern, period, spanning, from, approximately, 1500, to, 1800, ce, european, powers, explored, and, colonized, regions, worldwide, intensifying, cultural, and, economic, exchange, this, era, saw, substantial, intellectual, cultural, and, technological, advances, driven, by, the, renaissance, the, scientific, revolution, and, the, enlightenment, by, the, 18th, century, the, accumulation, of, knowledge, and, technology, had, reached, a, critical, mass, that, brought, about, the, industrial, revolution, and, began, the, modern, period, starting, around, 1800, ce, the, growth, in, productive, power, further, increased, international, trade, and, colonization, linking, the, different, civilizations, in, the, process, of, globalization, over, the, last, quarter, millennium, despite, the, devastating, effects, of, two, world, wars, there, has, been, a, great, acceleration, in, the, rates, of, growth, of, many, domains, including, human, population, agriculture, industry, commerce, scientific, knowledge, technology, communications, military, capabilities, and, environmental, degradation, the, study, of, human, history, relies, on, insights, from, academic, disciplines, including, history, archaeology, anthropology, linguistics, and, genetics, to, provide, an, accessible, overview, researchers, divide, human, history, by, a, variety, of, periodizations, humans, evolved, in, africa, from, great, apes, through, the, lineage, of, hominins, which, arose, 7, 5, million, years, ago, the, ability, to, walk, on, two, legs, emerged, after, the, split, from, chimpanzees, in, early, hominins, such, as, australopithecus, as, an, adaptation, possibly, associated, with, a, shift, from, forest, to, savanna, habitats, hominins, began, to, use, rudimentary, stone, tools, c, 3, 3, million, years, ago, marking, the, advent, of, the, paleolithic, era, the, genus, homo, evolved, from, australopithecus, the, earliest, record, of, homo, is, the, 2, 8, million, year, old, specimen, ld, 350, 1, from, ethiopia, and, the, earliest, named, species, is, homo, habilis, which, evolved, by, 2, 3, million, years, ago, the, most, important, difference, between, homo, habilis, and, australopithecus, was, a, 50, increase, in, brain, size, h, erectus, evolved, by, 2, million, years, ago, and, was, the, first, hominin, species, to, leave, africa, and, disperse, across, eurasia, perhaps, as, early, as, 1, 5, million, years, ago, but, certainly, by, 250, 000, years, ago, hominins, began, to, use, fire, for, heat, and, cooking, beginning, about, 500, 000, years, ago, homo, diversified, into, many, new, species, of, archaic, humans, such, as, the, neanderthals, in, europe, the, denisovans, in, siberia, and, the, diminutive, h, floresiensis, in, indonesia, human, evolution, was, not, a, simple, linear, or, branched, progression, but, involved, interbreeding, between, related, species, genomic, research, has, shown, that, hybridization, between, substantially, diverged, lineages, was, common, in, human, evolution, dna, evidence, suggests, that, several, genes, of, neanderthal, origin, are, present, among, all, non, sub, saharan, african, populations, neanderthals, and, other, hominins, such, as, denisovans, may, have, contributed, up, to, 6, of, their, genome, to, present, day, non, sub, saharan, african, humans, homo, sapiens, emerged, in, africa, around, 300, 000, years, ago, from, the, species, homo, heidelbergensis, humans, continued, to, develop, over, the, succeeding, millennia, and, by, 100, 000, years, ago, were, using, jewelry, and, ocher, to, adorn, the, body, by, 50, 000, years, ago, they, buried, their, dead, used, projectile, weapons, and, engaged, in, seafaring, one, of, the, most, important, changes, the, date, of, which, is, unknown, was, the, development, of, syntactic, language, which, dramatically, improved, the, human, ability, to, communicate, signs, of, early, artistic, expression, can, be, found, in, the, form, of, cave, paintings, and, sculptures, made, from, ivory, stone, and, bone, implying, a, form, of, spirituality, generally, interpreted, as, animism, or, shamanism, the, earliest, known, musical, instruments, besides, the, human, voice, are, bone, flutes, from, the, swabian, jura, in, germany, dated, around, 40, 000, years, old, paleolithic, humans, lived, as, hunter, gatherers, and, were, generally, nomadic, the, migration, of, anatomically, modern, humans, out, of, africa, took, place, in, multiple, waves, beginning, 194, 000, 177, 000, years, ago, the, dominant, view, among, scholars, is, that, the, early, waves, of, migration, died, out, and, all, modern, non, africans, are, descended, from, a, single, group, that, left, africa, 70, 000, 50, 000, years, ago, h, sapiens, proceeded, to, colonize, all, the, continents, and, larger, islands, arriving, in, australia, 65, 000, years, ago, europe, 45, 000, years, ago, and, the, americas, 21, 000, years, ago, these, migrations, occurred, during, the, most, recent, ice, age, when, various, temperate, regions, of, today, were, inhospitable, nevertheless, by, the, end, of, the, ice, age, some, 12, 000, years, ago, humans, had, colonized, nearly, all, ice, free, parts, of, the, globe, human, expansion, coincided, with, both, the, quaternary, extinction, event, and, the, neanderthal, extinction, these, extinctions, were, probably, caused, by, climate, change, human, activity, or, a, combination, of, the, two, beginning, around, 10, 000, bce, the, neolithic, revolution, marked, the, development, of, agriculture, which, fundamentally, changed, the, human, lifestyle, agriculture, began, independently, in, different, parts, of, the, globe, and, included, a, diverse, range, of, taxa, in, at, least, 11, separate, centers, of, origin, cereal, crop, cultivation, and, animal, domestication, had, occurred, in, mesopotamia, by, at, least, 8500, bce, in, the, form, of, wheat, barley, sheep, and, goats, the, yangtze, river, valley, in, china, domesticated, rice, around, 8000, 7000, bce, the, yellow, river, valley, may, have, cultivated, millet, by, 7000, bce, pigs, were, the, most, important, domesticated, animal, in, early, china, people, in, africa, s, sahara, cultivated, sorghum, and, several, other, crops, between, 8000, and, 5000, bce, while, other, agricultural, centers, arose, in, the, ethiopian, highlands, and, the, west, african, rainforests, in, the, indus, river, valley, crops, were, cultivated, by, 7000, bce, and, cattle, were, domesticated, by, 6500, bce, in, the, americas, squash, was, cultivated, by, at, least, 8500, bce, in, south, america, and, domesticated, arrowroot, appeared, in, central, america, by, 7800, bce, potatoes, were, first, cultivated, in, the, andes, of, south, america, where, the, llama, was, also, domesticated, it, is, likely, that, women, played, a, central, role, in, plant, domestication, throughout, these, developments, various, explanations, of, the, causes, of, the, neolithic, revolution, have, been, proposed, some, theories, identify, population, growth, as, the, main, factor, leading, people, to, seek, out, new, food, sources, others, see, population, growth, not, as, the, cause, but, as, the, effect, of, the, associated, improvements, in, food, supply, further, suggested, factors, include, climate, change, resource, scarcity, and, ideology, the, transition, to, agriculture, created, food, surpluses, that, could, support, people, not, directly, engaged, in, food, production, permitting, far, denser, populations, and, the, creation, of, the, first, cities, and, states, cities, were, centers, of, trade, manufacturing, and, political, power, they, developed, mutually, beneficial, relationships, with, their, surrounding, countrysides, receiving, agricultural, products, and, providing, manufactured, goods, and, varying, degrees, of, political, control, in, return, early, proto, cities, appeared, at, atalh, y, k, and, jericho, possibly, as, early, as, the, 10th, and, 9th, millennia, bce, pastoral, societies, based, on, nomadic, animal, herding, also, developed, mostly, in, dry, areas, unsuited, for, plant, cultivation, such, as, the, eurasian, steppe, or, the, african, sahel, conflict, between, nomadic, herders, and, sedentary, agriculturalists, was, frequent, and, became, a, recurring, theme, in, world, history, neolithic, societies, usually, worshiped, ancestors, sacred, places, or, anthropomorphic, deities, the, vast, complex, of, g, bekli, tepe, in, turkey, dated, 9500, 8000, bce, is, an, example, of, a, neolithic, religious, or, civic, site, metalworking, was, first, used, in, the, creation, of, copper, tools, and, ornaments, around, 6400, bce, gold, and, silver, soon, followed, primarily, for, use, in, ornaments, the, first, signs, of, bronze, an, alloy, of, copper, and, tin, date, to, around, 4500, bce, but, the, alloy, did, not, become, widely, used, until, the, third, millennium, bce, the, bronze, age, saw, the, development, of, cities, and, civilizations, early, civilizations, arose, close, to, rivers, first, in, mesopotamia, 3300, bce, with, the, tigris, and, euphrates, followed, by, the, egyptian, civilization, along, the, nile, river, 3200, bce, the, norte, chico, civilization, in, coastal, peru, 3100, bce, the, indus, valley, civilization, in, pakistan, and, northwestern, india, 2500, bce, and, the, chinese, civilization, along, the, yangtze, and, yellow, rivers, 2200, bce, these, societies, developed, a, number, of, shared, characteristics, including, a, central, government, a, complex, economy, and, social, structure, and, systems, for, keeping, records, these, cultures, variously, invented, the, wheel, mathematics, bronze, working, sailing, boats, the, potter, s, wheel, woven, cloth, construction, of, monumental, buildings, and, writing, polytheistic, religions, developed, centered, on, temples, where, priests, and, priestesses, performed, sacrificial, rites, writing, facilitated, the, administration, of, cities, the, expression, of, ideas, and, the, preservation, of, information, it, may, have, independently, developed, in, at, least, four, ancient, civilizations, mesopotamia, 3300, bce, egypt, around, 3250, bce, china, 1200, bce, and, lowland, mesoamerica, by, 650, bce, the, earliest, system, of, writing, was, the, mesopotamian, cuneiform, script, which, began, as, a, system, of, pictographs, whose, pictorial, representations, eventually, became, simplified, and, more, abstract, other, influential, early, writing, systems, include, egyptian, hieroglyphs, and, the, indus, script, in, china, writing, was, first, used, during, the, shang, dynasty, 1766, 1045, bce, transport, was, facilitated, by, waterways, including, rivers, and, seas, which, fostered, the, projection, of, military, power, and, the, exchange, of, goods, ideas, and, inventions, the, bronze, age, also, saw, new, land, technologies, such, as, horse, based, cavalry, and, chariots, that, allowed, armies, to, move, faster, trade, became, increasingly, important, as, urban, societies, exchanged, manufactured, goods, for, raw, materials, from, distant, lands, creating, vast, commercial, networks, and, the, beginnings, of, archaic, globalization, bronze, production, in, southwest, asia, for, example, required, the, import, of, tin, from, as, far, away, as, england, the, growth, of, cities, was, often, followed, by, the, establishment, of, states, and, empires, in, egypt, the, initial, division, into, upper, and, lower, egypt, was, followed, by, the, unification, of, the, whole, valley, around, 3100, bce, around, 2600, bce, the, indus, valley, civilization, built, major, cities, at, harappa, and, mohenjo, daro, mesopotamian, history, was, characterized, by, frequent, wars, between, city, states, leading, to, shifts, in, hegemony, from, one, city, to, another, in, the, 25th, 21st, centuries, bce, the, empires, of, akkad, and, the, neo, sumerians, arose, in, this, area, in, crete,
