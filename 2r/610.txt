theirs, to, have, he, was, thrilled, to, have, visitors, of, such, stature, although, the, spaniards, were, seeking, gold, moctezuma, expressed, that, he, had, very, little, of, the, sort, but, all, of, it, was, to, be, given, to, cort, s, if, he, desired, it, soon, after, arriving, in, tenochtitlan, cort, s, came, up, against, problems, at, vera, cruz, the, officer, left, in, charge, received, a, letter, from, qualpopoca, the, leader, of, nueva, almer, a, asking, to, become, a, vassal, of, the, spaniards, he, requested, that, officials, be, sent, to, him, so, that, he, could, confirm, his,
