gojoseon, lee, k, b, 1984, believes, dangun, wanggeom, was, a, title, borne, by, successive, leaders, of, gojoseon, dangun, is, said, to, have, founded, gojoseon, around, 2333, bc, based, on, the, descriptions, of, the, samgungnyusa, jewang, ungi, dongguk, tonggam, and, the, annals, of, the, joseon, dynasty, the, date, differs, among, historical, sources, although, all, of, them, put, it,

war, against, the, yan, in, the, 4th, century, bce, gija, a, man, from, the, period, of, the, shang, dynasty, allegedly, fled, to, the, korean, peninsula, in, 1122, bc, during, the, fall, of, the, shang, to, the, zhou, dynasty, and, founded, gija, joseon, gija, joseon, is, recognized, and, mentioned, in, the, earliest, surviving, chinese, record, records, of, the, three, kingdoms, gija, s, story, was, further, developed, in, later, korean, texts, such, as, samguk, yusa, and, jewang, ungi, by, the, middle, of, goryeo, dynasty, a, state, cult, had, developed, around, gija, the, dongsa, gangmok, of, 1778, described, gija, s, activities, and, contributions, in, gojoseon, the, records, of, gija, refer, to, eight, prohibitions, korean, hanja, that, are, recorded, by, the, book, of, han,

the, 12th, century, ce, koreans, commonly, believed, that, dangun, bestowed, upon, korea, its, people, and, basic, culture, while, gija, gave, korea, its, high, culture, and, presumably, standing, as, a, legitimate, civilisation, many, modern, experts, have, denied, gija, joseon, s, existence, for, various, reasons, mainly, due, to, contradicting, archaeological, evidence, and, anachronistic, historical, evidence, they, point, to, the, bamboo, annals, and, the, analects, of, confucius, which, were, among, the, first, works, to, mention, gija, but, do, not, mention, his, migration, to, gojoseon, gija, joseon, might, have, just, existed, as, a, symbol, of, the, pre, qin, dynasty, migrants, who, escaped, the, chaos, of, the, warring, states, period, wi, man, was, a, military, officer, of, the, yan, of, northeastern, china, who, fled, to, the, northern, korean, peninsula, in, 195, bce, from, the, encroaching, han, dynasty, he, founded, a, principality, with, wanggeom, seong, as, its, capital, which, is, thought, to, be, in, the, region, of, present, day, pyongyang, the, 3rd, century, chinese, text, weil, e, of, the, sanguozhi, recorded, that, wi, man, usurped, king, jun, and, thus, took, over, the, kingship, of, gojoseon, gojoseon, mythology, and, history, can, be, divided, into, three, phases, dangun, gija, joseon, and, wi, man, joseon, around, the, mid, joseon, dynasty, the, established, view, among, historians, traced, korean, origins, to, chinese, refugees, considering, korean, history, that, of, a, long, series, of, kingdoms, connected, with, china, as, such, the, gija, joseon, and, silla, states, were, valorized, while, the, gojoseon, and, goguryeo, states, were, not, considered, as, important, according, to, this, view, the, first, state, in, korea, gija, joseon, was, founded, by, jizi, in, 1122, bce, who, was, a, disgruntled, chinese, advisor, to, the, shang, dynasty, the, story, of, how, he, brought, poetry, music, medicine, trade, and, a, political, system, to, the, korean, peninsula, was, conceived, similarly, to, the, proposed, founding, of, rome, by, the, trojan, refugee, aeneas, but, by, the, 1930s, under, the, influence, of, shin, chaeho, s, histories, the, jizi, korean, founding, story, became, less, popular, than, that, of, dangun, the, son, of, a, tiger, and, a, bear, the, latter, being, common, in, japanese, folklore, who, brought, civilization, to, the, korean, peninsula, shin, and, the, other, historians, who, promulgated, this, myth, had, been, influenced, by, daejonggyo, a, new, religious, movement, which, worshipped, dangun, but, attacked, pre, annexation, textbook, narratives, of, dangun, which, portrayed, him, as, the, brother, of, the, japanese, god, susanoo, to, shin, dangun, was, both, the, founder, of, the, korean, minjok, and, the, first, korean, state, kuk, and, thus, the, necessary, starting, point, for, korean, history, in, response, to, a, challenge, by, the, japanese, scholars, shiratori, kurakichi, and, imanishi, ry, of, dangun, as, a, fabrication, by, the, author, of, the, samguk, yusa, nationalist, historian, choe, nam, seon, attacked, japanese, mythology, as, being, built, upon, fabrications, by, focusing, on, a, mythological, god, which, founded, a, sacred, race, shins, ng, chongjok, korean, nationalist, historiography, aims, to, portray, ancient, korea, as, a, golden, age, of, gods, and, heroes, where, korea, s, cultural, achievements, rivaled, those, of, china, and, japan, accordingly, shin, chaeho, elevated, dangun, to, play, a, similar, role, as, did, the, yellow, emperor, in, china, and, which, amaterasu, does, in, japan, choe, nam, seon, according, to, his, purham, culture, theory, places, dangun, even, above, the, chinese, and, japanese, emperors, because, those, rulers, were, supposedly, shamanistic, rulers, of, the, ancient, korean, p, rk, tradition, the, dangun, story, also, lends, credence, to, claims, that, korean, heritage, is, over, 5000, years, old, according, to, hyung, il, pai, the, popularity, of, dangun, studies, can, be, said, to, reflect, the, progressively, ultra, nationalistic, trend, in, korean, historical, and, archaeological, scholarship, today, shin, chaeho, named, mount, paektu, in, the, changbai, mountains, on, the, sino, korean, border, as, a, part, of, korean, heritage, by, virtue, of, connection, with, the, mythical, dangun, the, mountain, however, was, also, claimed, by, the, manchus, of, the, qing, dynasty, as, part, of, their, origin, myth, at, least, since, the, 17th, century, and, the, mountain, range, is, considered, sacred, in, han, chinese, culture, as, well, this, nationalist, identification, of, baekdu, with, koreans, was, cemented, by, the, operation, of, korean, independence, movement, partisans, operating, from, the, chinese, border, and, legitimized, with, associations, to, the, history, of, the, gojoseon, and, balhae, states, the, chinese, civilizational, connection, to, ancient, korea, continues, to, be, attacked, by, north, korean, historians, who, allege, that, the, history, of, gija, joseon, was, viciously, distorted, by, the, feudal, ruling, class, the, sadaejuui, followers, and, the, big, power, chauvinists, the, first, mentions, of, gojoseon, are, found, in, historical, records, of, guanzi, it, locates, gojoseon, around, bohai, bay, and, mentions, the, state, trading, with, qi, of, china, the, zhanguoce, shanhaijing, and, shiji, containing, some, of, its, earliest, records, refers, to, joseon, as, a, region, until, the, text, shiji, began, referring, it, as, a, country, from, 195, bc, onwards, by, the, 4th, century, bce, other, states, with, defined, political, structures, developed, in, the, areas, of, the, earlier, bronze, age, walled, town, states, gojoseon, was, the, most, advanced, of, them, in, the, peninsular, region, the, city, state, expanded, by, incorporating, other, neighboring, city, states, by, alliance, or, military, conquest, thus, a, vast, confederation, of, political, entities, between, the, taedong, and, liao, rivers, was, formed, as, gojoseon, evolved, so, did, the, title, and, function, of, its, leader, who, came, to, be, designated, as, king, han, in, the, tradition, of, the, zhou, dynasty, around, the, same, time, as, the, yan, leader, records, of, that, time, mention, the, hostility, between, the, feudal, state, in, northern, china, and, the, confederated, kingdom, of, gojoseon, notably, a, plan, to, attack, the, yan, beyond, the, liao, river, frontier, is, recorded, this, confrontation, led, to, the, decline, and, eventual, downfall, of, gojoseon, described, in, yan, records, as, arrogant, and, cruel, but, the, ancient, kingdom, also, appears, as, a, prosperous, bronze, age, civilization, with, a, complex, social, structure, including, a, class, of, horse, riding, warriors, who, contributed, to, the, development, of, gojoseon, and, its, northern, expansion, into, most, of, the, liaodong, basin, around, 300, bce, gojoseon, lost, significant, western, territory, after, a, war, with, the, yan, state, but, this, indicates, gojoseon, was, already, a, large, enough, state, that, it, could, wage, war, against, the, yan, and, survive, the, loss, of, 2000, li, 800, kilometers, of, territory, gojoseon, is, thought, to, have, relocated, its, capital, to, the, pyongyang, region, around, this, time, in, 195, bce, king, jun, appointed, a, refugee, from, yan, wi, man, to, guard, the, frontier, wi, man, later, rebelled, in, 194, bc, and, usurped, the, throne, of, gojoseon, king, jun, fled, to, jin, in, the, south, of, the, korean, peninsula, in, 109, bce, emperor, wu, of, han, invaded, near, the, liao, river, a, conflict, would, erupt, in, 109, bce, when, wi, man, s, grandson, king, ugeo, hanja, refused, to, let, jin, s, ambassadors, through, his, territory, in, order, to, reach, the, han, dynasty, king, ugeo, refused, and, had, his, son, prince, wi, jang, escort, the, ambassador, back, home, however, when, they, got, close, to, han, s, borders, the, ambassador, assassinated, wi, jang, and, claimed, to, emperor, wu, that, he, had, defeated, joseon, in, battle, emperor, wu, unaware, of, this, deception, made, him, the, military, commander, of, the, commandery, of, liaodong, the, outraged, king, ugeo, made, a, raid, on, liaodong, and, killed, she, he, scholars, also, hypothesize, that, the, initiation, of, war, may, also, have, been, because, the, han, dynasty, was, concerned, that, gojoseon, would, ally, with, the, xiongnu, against, the, han, in, response, emperor, wu, commissioned, a, two, pronged, attack, one, by, land, and, one, by, sea, against, gojoseon, the, two, forces, attacking, gojoseon, were, unable, to, coordinate, well, with, each, other, and, suffered, large, losses, eventually, the, commands, were, merged, and, wanggeom, fell, in, 108, bce, han, took, over, the, gojoseon, lands, and, established, four, commanderies, of, han, in, the, western, part, of, former, gojoseon, gojoseon, disintegrated, by, the, 1st, century, bce, as, it, gradually, lost, the, control, of, its, former, fiefs, many, successor, states, sprang, from, its, former, territory, such, as, buyeo, okjeo, dongye, goguryeo, and, baekje, arose, out, from, buyeo, around, 2000, bce, a, new, pottery, culture, of, painted, and, chiseled, design, was, developed, these, people,

peninsula, bronze, daggers, and, mirrors, have, been, excavated, and, there, is, archaeological, evidence, of, small, walled, town, states, in, this, period, dolmens, and, bronze, daggers, found, in, the, area, are, uniquely, korean, and, cannot, be, found, in, china, a, few, dolmens, are, found, in, china, mostly, in, the, shandong, province, in, the, mumun, pottery, period, 1500, 300, bce, plain, coarse, pottery, replaced, earlier, comb, pattern, wares, possibly, as, a, result, of, the, influence, of, new, populations, migrating, to, korea, from, manchuria, and, siberia, this, type, of, pottery, typically, has, thicker, walls, and, displays, a, wider, variety, of, shapes, indicating, improvements, in, kiln, technology, this, period, is, sometimes, called, the, korean, bronze, age, but, bronze, artifacts, are, relatively, rare, and, regionalized, until, the, 7th, century, bce, rice, cultivation, was, extensive, in, the, lower, parts, of, south, korea, and, manchuria, in, the, periods, between, 1900, bce, to, 200, ce, the, beginning, of, the, bronze, age, on, the, peninsula, is, usually, said, to, be, 1000, bce, but, estimates, range, from, the, 13th, to, 8th, centuries, bce, although, the, korean, bronze, age, culture, derives, from, the, liaoning, and, manchuria, it, exhibits, unique, typology, and, styles, especially, in, ritual, objects, by, the, 7th, century,
