the, ptolemaic, kingdom, t, l, m, e, k, koin, greek, romanized, ptolema, k, basile, a, or, ptolemaic, empire, was, an, ancient, greek, polity, based, in, egypt, during, the, hellenistic, period, it, was, founded, in, 305, bc, by, the, macedonian, general, ptolemy, i, soter, a, companion, of, alexander, the, great, and, ruled, by, the, ptolemaic, dynasty, until, the, death, of, cleopatra, vii, in, 30, bc, reigning, for, nearly, three, centuries, the, ptolemies, were, the, longest, and, final, dynasty, of, ancient, egypt, heralding, a, distinctly, new, era, for, religious, and, cultural, syncretism, between, greek, and, egyptian, culture, alexander, the, great, conquered, persian, controlled, egypt, in, 332, bc, during, his, campaigns, against, the, achaemenid, empire, his, death, in, 323, bc, was, followed, by, rapid, unraveling, of, the, macedonian, empire, amid, competing, claims, by, the, diadochi, his, closest, friends, and, companions, ptolemy, a, macedonian, who, was, one, of, alexander, s, most, trusted, generals, and, confidants, won, control, of, egypt, from, his, rivals, and, declared, himself, its, ruler, alexandria, a, greek, polis, founded, by, alexander, became, the, capital, city, and, a, major, center, of, greek, culture, learning, and, trade, for, the, next, several, centuries, following, the, syrian, wars, with, the, seleucid, empire, a, rival, hellenistic, state, the, ptolemaic, kingdom, expanded, its, territory, to, include, eastern, libya, the, sinai, and, northern, nubia, to, legitimize, their, rule, and, gain, recognition, from, native, egyptians, the, ptolemies, adopted, the, local, title, of, pharaoh, alongside, the, greek, title, of, basileus, and, had, themselves, portrayed, on, public, monuments, in, egyptian, style, and, dress, however, the, monarchy, otherwise, rigorously, maintained, its, hellenistic, character, and, traditions, the, kingdom, had, a, complex, government, bureaucracy, that, exploited, the, country, s, vast, economic, resources, to, the, benefit, of, a, greek, ruling, class, which, dominated, military, political, and, economic, affairs, and, which, rarely, integrated, into, egyptian, society, and, culture, native, egyptians, maintained, power, over, local, and, religious, institutions, and, only, gradually, accrued, power, in, the, bureaucracy, provided, they, hellenized, beginning, with, ptolemy, i, s, son, and, successor, ptolemy, ii, philadelphus, the, ptolemies, began, to, adopt, egyptian, customs, such, as, marrying, their, siblings, per, the, osiris, myth, and, participating, in, egyptian, religious, life, new, temples, were, built, older, ones, restored, and, royal, patronage, lavished, on, the, priesthood, from, the, mid, third, century, bc, ptolemaic, egypt, was, the, wealthiest, and, most, powerful, of, alexander, s, successor, states, and, the, leading, example, of, greek, civilization, beginning, in, the, mid, second, century, bc, dynastic, strife, and, a, series, of, foreign, wars, weakened, the, kingdom, and, it, became, increasingly, reliant, on, the, roman, republic, under, cleopatra, vii, who, sought, to, restore, ptolemaic, power, egypt, became, entangled, in, a, roman, civil, war, which, ultimately, led, to, its, conquest, by, rome, as, the, last, independent, hellenistic, state, roman, egypt, became, one, of, rome, s, richest, provinces, and, a, center, of, greek, culture, greek, remained, the, language, of, government, and, trade, until, the, muslim, conquest, in, 641, ad, alexandria, remained, one, of, the, leading, cities, of, the, mediterranean, well, into, the, late, middle, ages, the, ptolemaic, reign, in, egypt, is, one, of, the, best, documented, time, periods, of, the, hellenistic, era, due, to, the, discovery, of, a, wealth, of, papyri, and, ostraca, written, in, koine, greek, and, egyptian, in, 332, bc, alexander, the, great, king, of, macedon, conquered, egypt, which, at, the, time, was, a, satrapy, of, the, achaemenid, empire, later, called, egypt, s, thirty, first, dynasty, he, visited, memphis, and, travelled, to, the, oracle, of, amun, at, the, siwa, oasis, the, oracle, declared, him, to, be, the, son, of, amun, alexander, conciliated, the, egyptians, by, the, respect, he, showed, for, their, religion, but, he, appointed, macedonians, to, virtually, all, the, senior, posts, in, the, country, and, founded, a, new, greek, city, alexandria, to, be, the, new, capital, the, wealth, of, egypt, could, now, be, harnessed, for, alexander, s, conquest, of, the, rest, of, the, achaemenid, empire, early, in, 331, bc, he, was, ready, to, depart, and, led, his, forces, away, to, phoenicia, he, left, cleomenes, of, naucratis, as, the, ruling, nomarch, to, control, egypt, in, his, absence, alexander, would, never, return, to, egypt, following, alexander, s, death, in, babylon, in, 323, bc, a, succession, crisis, erupted, among, his, generals, initially, perdiccas, ruled, the, empire, as, regent, for, alexander, s, half, brother, arrhidaeus, who, became, philip, iii, of, macedon, and, then, as, regent, for, both, philip, iii, and, alexander, s, infant, son, alexander, iv, of, macedon, who, had, not, been, born, at, the, time, of, his, father, s, death, perdiccas, appointed, ptolemy, one, of, alexander, s, closest, companions, to, be, satrap, of, egypt, ptolemy, ruled, egypt, from, 323, bc, nominally, in, the, name, of, the, joint, kings, philip, iii, and, alexander, iv, however, as, alexander, the, great, s, empire, disintegrated, ptolemy, soon, established, himself, as, ruler, in, his, own, right, ptolemy, successfully, defended, egypt, against, an, invasion, by, perdiccas, in, 321, bc, and, consolidated, his, position, in, egypt, and, the, surrounding, areas, during, the, wars, of, the, diadochi, 322, 301, bc, in, 305, bc, ptolemy, took, the, title, of, basileus, and, pharaoh, as, ptolemy, i, soter, saviour, he, founded, the, ptolemaic, dynasty, that, was, to, rule, egypt, for, nearly, 300, years, all, the, male, rulers, of, the, dynasty, took, the, name, ptolemy, while, princesses, and, female, rulers, preferred, the, names, cleopatra, arsino, and, berenice, the, ptolemies, also, adopted, the, egyptian, custom, of, marrying, their, sisters, with, many, of, their, line, ruling, jointly, with, their, spouses, who, were, also, of, the, royal, house, this, custom, made, ptolemaic, politics, confusingly, incestuous, and, the, later, ptolemies, were, increasingly, feeble, the, only, basilissa, regnant, or, female, pharaohs, to, officially, rule, on, their, own, were, cleopatra, ii, berenice, iii, and, berenice, iv, cleopatra, v, did, co, rule, but, it, was, with, another, female, berenice, iv, cleopatra, vii, officially, co, ruled, with, ptolemy, xiii, theos, philopator, ptolemy, xiv, and, ptolemy, xv, but, effectively, she, ruled, egypt, alone, the, early, ptolemies, did, not, disturb, the, religion, or, the, customs, of, the, egyptians, they, built, magnificent, new, temples, for, the, egyptian, gods, and, soon, adopted, the, outward, display, of, the, pharaohs, of, old, rulers, such, as, ptolemy, i, soter, respected, the, egyptian, people, and, recognized, the, importance, of, their, religion, and, traditions, during, the, reign, of, ptolemies, ii, and, iii, thousands, of, macedonian, veterans, were, rewarded, with, grants, of, farm, lands, and, macedonians, were, planted, in, colonies, and, garrisons, or, settled, themselves, in, villages, throughout, the, country, upper, egypt, farthest, from, the, centre, of, government, was, less, immediately, affected, even, though, ptolemy, i, established, the, greek, colony, of, ptolemais, hermiou, to, be, its, capital, but, within, a, century, greek, influence, had, spread, through, the, country, and, intermarriage, had, produced, a, large, greco, egyptian, educated, class, nevertheless, the, greeks, always, remained, a, privileged, minority, in, ptolemaic, egypt, they, lived, under, greek, law, received, a, greek, education, were, tried, in, greek, courts, and, were, citizens, of, greek, cities, the, first, part, of, ptolemy, i, s, reign, was, dominated, by, the, wars, of, the, diadochi, between, the, various, successor, states, to, the, empire, of, alexander, his, first, objective, was, to, hold, his, position, in, egypt, securely, and, secondly, to, increase, his, domain, within, a, few, years, he, had, gained, control, of, libya, coele, syria, including, judea, and, cyprus, when, antigonus, ruler, of, syria, tried, to, reunite, alexander, s, empire, ptolemy, joined, the, coalition, against, him, in, 312, bc, allied, with, seleucus, the, ruler, of, babylonia, he, defeated, demetrius, the, son, of, antigonus, in, the, battle, of, gaza, in, 311, bc, a, peace, was, concluded, between, the, combatants, but, in, 309, bc, war, broke, out, again, and, ptolemy, occupied, corinth, and, other, parts, of, greece, although, he, lost, cyprus, after, a, naval, battle, in, 306, bc, antigonus, then, tried, to, invade, egypt, but, ptolemy, held, the, frontier, against, him, when, the, coalition, was, renewed, against, antigonus, in, 302, bc, ptolemy, joined, it, but, neither, he, nor, his, army, were, present, when, antigonus, was, defeated, and, killed, at, ipsus, he, had, instead, taken, the, opportunity, to, secure, coele, syria, and, palestine, in, breach, of, the, agreement, assigning, it, to, seleucus, thereby, setting, the, scene, for, the, future, syrian, wars, thereafter, ptolemy, tried, to, stay, out, of, land, wars, but, he, retook, cyprus, in, 295, bc, feeling, the, kingdom, was, now, secure, ptolemy, shared, rule, with, his, son, ptolemy, ii, by, queen, berenice, in, 285, bc, he, then, may, have, devoted, his, retirement, to, writing, a, history, of, the, campaigns, of, alexander, which, unfortunately, was, lost, but, was, a, principal, source, for, the, later, work, of, arrian, ptolemy, i, died, in, 283, bc, at, the, age, of, 84, he, left, a, stable, and, well, governed, kingdom, to, his, son, ptolemy, ii, philadelphus, who, succeeded, his, father, as, pharaoh, of, egypt, in, 283, bc, was, a, peaceful, and, cultured, pharaoh, though, unlike, his, father, was, no, great, warrior, fortunately, ptolemy, i, had, left, egypt, strong, and, prosperous, three, years, of, campaigning, in, the, first, syrian, war, made, the, ptolemies, masters, of, the, eastern, mediterranean, controlling, the, aegean, islands, the, nesiotic, league, and, the, coastal, districts, of, cilicia, pamphylia, lycia, and, caria, however, some, of, these, territories, were, lost, near, the, end, of, his, reign, as, a, result, of, the, second, syrian, war, in, the, 270s, bc, ptolemy, ii, defeated, the, kingdom, of, kush, in, war, gaining, the, ptolemies, free, access, to, kushite, territory, and, control, of, important, gold, deposits, south, of, egypt, known, as, dodekasoinos, as, a, result, the, ptolemies, established, hunting, stations, and, ports, as, far, south, as, port, sudan, from, where, raiding, parties, containing, hundreds, of, men, searched, for, war, elephants, hellenistic, culture, would, acquire, an, important, influence, on, kush, at, this, time, ptolemy, ii, was, an, eager, patron, of, scholarship, funding, the, expansion, of, the, library, of, alexandria, and, patronising, scientific, research, poets, like, callimachus, theocritus, apollonius, of, rhodes, posidippus, were, provided, with, stipends, and, produced, masterpieces, of, hellenistic, poetry, including, panegyrics, in, honour, of, the, ptolemaic, family, other, scholars, operating, under, ptolemy, s, aegis, included, the, mathematician, euclid, and, the, astronomer, aristarchus, ptolemy, is, thought, to, have, commissioned, manetho, to, compose, his, aegyptiaca, an, account, of, egyptian, history, perhaps, intended, to, make, egyptian, culture, intelligible, to, its, new, rulers, ptolemy, s, first, wife, arsinoe, i, daughter, of, lysimachus, was, the, mother, of, his, legitimate, children, after, her, repudiation, he, followed, egyptian, custom, and, married, his, sister, arsinoe, ii, beginning, a, practice, that, while, pleasing, to, the, egyptian, population, had, serious, consequences, in, later, reigns, the, material, and, literary, splendour, of, the, alexandrian, court, was, at, its, height, under, ptolemy, ii, callimachus, keeper, of, the, library, of, alexandria, theocritus, and, a, host, of, other, poets, glorified, the, ptolemaic, family, ptolemy, himself, was, eager, to, increase, the, library, and, to, patronise, scientific, research, he, spent, lavishly, on, making, alexandria, the, economic, artistic, and, intellectual, capital, of, the, hellenistic, world, the, academies, and, libraries, of, alexandria, proved, vital, in, preserving, much, greek, literary, heritage, ptolemy, iii, euergetes, the, benefactor, succeeded, his, father, in, 246, bc, he, abandoned, his, predecessors, policy, of, keeping, out, of, the, wars, of, the, other, macedonian, successor, kingdoms, and, began, the, third, syrian, war, 246, 241, bc, with, the, seleucid, empire, when, his, sister, queen, berenice, and, her, son, were, murdered, in, a, dynastic, dispute, ptolemy, marched, into, the, heart, of, the, seleucid, realm, as, far, as, babylonia, while, his, fleets, in, the, aegean, sea, made, fresh, conquests, as, far, north, as, thrace, this, victory, marked, the, zenith, of, the, ptolemaic, power, seleucus, ii, callinicus, kept, his, throne, but, egyptian, fleets, controlled, most, of, the, coasts, of, anatolia, and, greece, after, this, triumph, ptolemy, no, longer, engaged, actively, in, war, although, he, supported, the, enemies, of, macedon, in, greek, politics, his, domestic, policy, differed, from, his, father, s, in, that, he, patronised, the, native, egyptian, religion, more, liberally, he, left, larger, traces, among, the, egyptian, monuments, in, this, his, reign, marks, the, gradual, egyptianisation, of, the, ptolemies, ptolemy, iii, continued, his, predecessor, s, sponsorship, of, scholarship, and, literature, the, great, library, in, the, musaeum, was, supplemented, by, a, second, library, built, in, the, serapeum, he, was, said, to, have, had, every, book, unloaded, in, the, alexandria, docks, seized, and, copied, returning, the, copies, to, their, owners, and, keeping, the, originals, for, the, library, it, is, said, that, he, borrowed, the, official, manuscripts, of, aeschylus, sophocles, and, euripides, from, athens, and, forfeited, the, considerable, deposit, he, paid, for, them, in, order, to, keep, them, for, the, library, rather, than, returning, them, the, most, distinguished, scholar, at, ptolemy, iii, s, court, was, the, polymath, and, geographer, eratosthenes, most, noted, for, his, remarkably, accurate, calculation, of, the, circumference, of, the, world, other, prominent, scholars, include, the, mathematicians, conon, of, samos, and, apollonius, of, perge, ptolemy, iii, financed, construction, projects, at, temples, across, egypt, the, most, significant, of, these, was, the, temple, of, horus, at, edfu, one, of, the, masterpieces, of, ancient, egyptian, temple, architecture, and, now, the, best, preserved, of, all, egyptian, temples, ptolemy, iii, initiated, construction, on, it, on, 23, august, 237, bc, work, continued, for, most, of, the, ptolemaic, dynasty, the, main, temple, was, finished, in, the, reign, of, his, son, ptolemy, iv, in, 212, bc, and, the, full, complex, was, only, completed, in, 142, bc, during, the, reign, of, ptolemy, viii, while, the, reliefs, on, the, great, pylon, were, finished, in, the, reign, of, ptolemy, xii, in, 221, bc, ptolemy, iii, died, and, was, succeeded, by, his, son, ptolemy, iv, philopator, a, weak, king, whose, rule, precipitated, the, decline, of, the, ptolemaic, kingdom, his, reign, was, inaugurated, by, the, murder, of, his, mother, and, he, was, always, under, the, influence, of, royal, favourites, who, controlled, the, government, nevertheless, his, ministers, were, able, to, make, serious, preparations, to, meet, the, attacks, of, antiochus, iii, the, great, on, coele, syria, and, the, great, egyptian, victory, of, raphia, in, 217, bc, secured, the, kingdom, a, sign, of, the, domestic, weakness, of, his, reign, was, the, rebellions, by, native, egyptians, that, took, away, over, half, the, country, for, over, 20, years, philopator, was, devoted, to, orgiastic, religions, and, to, literature, he, married, his, sister, arsino, but, was, ruled, by, his, mistress, agathoclea, like, his, predecessors, ptolemy, iv, presented, himself, as, a, typical, egyptian, pharaoh, and, actively, supported, the, egyptian, priestly, elite, through, donations, and, temple, construction, ptolemy, iii, had, introduced, an, important, innovation, in, 238, bc, by, holding, a, synod, of, all, the, priests, of, egypt, at, canopus, ptolemy, iv, continued, this, tradition, by, holding, his, own, synod, at, memphis, in, 217, bc, after, the, victory, celebrations, of, the, fourth, syrian, war, the, result, of, this, synod, was, the, raphia, decree, issued, on, 15, november, 217, bc, and, preserved, in, three, copies, like, other, ptolemaic, decrees, the, decree, was, inscribed, in, hieroglyphs, demotic, and, koine, greek, the, decree, records, the, military, success, of, ptolemy, iv, and, arsinoe, iii, and, their, benefactions, to, the, egyptian, priestly, elite, throughout, ptolemy, iv, is, presented, as, taking, on, the, role, of, horus, who, avenges, his, father, by, defeating, the, forces, of, disorder, led, by, the, god, set, in, return, the, priests, undertook, to, erect, a, statue, group, in, each, of, their, temples, depicting, the, god, of, the, temple, presenting, a, sword, of, victory, to, ptolemy, iv, and, arsinoe, iii, a, five, day, festival, was, inaugurated, in, honour, of, the, theoi, philopatores, and, their, victory, the, decree, thus, seems, to, represent, a, successful, marriage, of, egyptian, pharaonic, ideology, and, religion, with, the, hellenistic, greek, ideology, of, the, victorious, king, and, his, ruler, cult, misrule, by, the, pharaoh, in, alexandria, led, to, a, nearly, successful, revolt, led, by, a, priest, named, hugronaphor, he, proclaimed, himself, pharaoh, in, 205, bc, and, ruled, upper, egypt, until, his, death, in, 199, bc, he, was, succeeded, by, his, son, ankhmakis, whose, forces, nearly, drove, the, ptolemies, out, of, the, country, the, revolutionary, dynasty, was, finally, defeated, in, 185, and, a, stele, celebrating, this, event, was, historically, significant, as, the, famous, rosetta, stone, ptolemy, v, epiphanes, son, of, philopator, and, arsino, was, a, child, when, he, came, to, the, throne, and, a, series, of, regents, ran, the, kingdom, antiochus, iii, the, great, of, the, seleucid, empire, and, philip, v, of, macedon, made, a, compact, to, seize, the, ptolemaic, possessions, philip, seized, several, islands, and, places, in, caria, and, thrace, while, the, battle, of, panium, in, 200, bc, transferred, coele, syria, from, ptolemaic, to, seleucid, control, after, this, defeat, egypt, formed, an, alliance, with, the, rising, power, in, the, mediterranean, rome, once, he, reached, adulthood, epiphanes, became, a, tyrant, before, his, early, death, in, 180, bc, he, was, succeeded, by, his, infant, son, ptolemy, vi, philometor, in, 170, bc, antiochus, iv, epiphanes, invaded, egypt, and, captured, philometor, installing, him, at, memphis, as, a, puppet, king, philometor, s, younger, brother, later, ptolemy, viii, physcon, was, installed, as, king, by, the, ptolemaic, court, in, alexandria, when, antiochus, withdrew, the, brothers, agreed, to, reign, jointly, with, their, sister, cleopatra, ii, they, soon, fell, out, however, and, quarrels, between, the, two, brothers, allowed, rome, to, interfere, and, to, steadily, increase, its, influence, in, egypt, philometor, eventually, regained, the, throne, in, 145, bc, he, was, killed, in, the, battle, of, antioch, throughout, the, 160s, and, 150s, bc, ptolemy, vi, has, also, reasserted, ptolemaic, control, over, the, northern, part, of, nubia, this, achievement, is, heavily, advertised, at, the, temple, of, isis, at, philae, which, was, granted, the, tax, revenues, of, the, dodecaschoenus, region, in, 157, bc, decorations, on, the, first, pylon, of, the, temple, of, isis, at, philae, emphasise, the, ptolemaic, claim, to, rule, the, whole, of, nubia, the, aforementioned, inscription, regarding, the, priests, of, mandulis, shows, that, some, nubian, leaders, at, least, were, paying, tribute, to, the, ptolemaic, treasury, in, this, period, in, order, to, secure, the, region, the, strategos, of, upper, egypt, boethus, founded, two, new, cities, named, philometris, and, cleopatra, in, honour, of, the, royal, couple, after, ptolemy, vi, s, death, a, series, of, civil, wars, and, feuds, between, the, members, of, the, ptolemaic, dynasty, started, and, lasted, for, over, a, century, philometor, was, succeeded, by, yet, another, infant, his, son, ptolemy, vii, neos, philopator, but, physcon, soon, returned, killed, his, young, nephew, seized, the, throne, and, as, ptolemy, viii, soon, proved, himself, a, cruel, tyrant, on, his, death, in, 116, bc, he, left, the, kingdom, to, his, wife, cleopatra, iii, and, her, son, ptolemy, ix, philometor, soter, ii, the, young, king, was, driven, out, by, his, mother, in, 107, bc, who, reigned, jointly, with, euergetes, s, youngest, son, ptolemy, x, alexander, i, in, 88, bc, ptolemy, ix, again, returned, to, the, throne, and, retained, it, until, his, death, in, 80, bc, he, was, succeeded, by, ptolemy, xi, alexander, ii, the, son, of, ptolemy, x, he, was, lynched, by, the, alexandrian, mob, after, murdering, his, stepmother, who, was, also, his, cousin, aunt, and, wife, these, sordid, dynastic, quarrels, left, egypt, so, weakened, that, the, country, became, a, de, facto, protectorate, of, rome, which, had, by, now, absorbed, most, of, the, greek, world, ptolemy, xi, was, succeeded, by, a, son, of, ptolemy, ix, ptolemy, xii, neos, dionysos, nicknamed, auletes, the, flute, player, by, now, rome, was, the, arbiter, of, egyptian, affairs, and, annexed, both, libya, and, cyprus, in, 58, bc, auletes, was, driven, out, by, the, alexandrian, mob, but, the, romans, restored, him, to, power, three, years, later, he, died, in, 51, bc, leaving, the, kingdom, to, his, ten, year, old, son, and, seventeen, year, old, daughter, ptolemy, xiii, theos, philopator, and, cleopatra, vii, who, reigned, jointly, as, husband, and, wife, cleopatra, vii, ascended, the, egyptian, throne, on, 22, march, 51, bc, upon, the, death, of, her, father, ptolemy, xii, neos, dionysos, she, reigned, as, queen, philopator, and, pharaoh, with, various, male, co, regents, from, 51, to, 30, bc, the, demise, of, the, ptolemies, power, coincided, with, the, growing, dominance, of, the, roman, republic, with, one, empire, after, another, falling, to, macedon, and, the, seleucid, empire, the, ptolemies, had, had, little, choice, but, to, ally, with, the, romans, a, pact, that, lasted, over, 150, years, by, ptolemy, xii, s, time, rome, had, achieved, a, massive, amount, of, influence, over, egyptian, politics, and, finances, to, the, point, that, he, declared, the, roman, senate, the, guardian, of, the, ptolemaic, dynasty, he, had, paid, vast, sums, of, egyptian, wealth, and, resources, in, tribute, to, the, romans, in, order, to, regain, and, secure, his, throne, following, the, rebellion, and, brief, coup, led, by, his, older, daughters, tryphaena, and, berenice, iv, both, daughters, were, killed, in, auletes, reclaiming, of, his, throne, tryphaena, by, assassination, and, berenice, by, execution, leaving, cleopatra, vii, as, the, oldest, surviving, child, of, ptolemy, auletes, traditionally, ptolemaic, royal, siblings, were, married, to, one, another, on, ascension, to, the, throne, these, marriages, sometimes, produced, children, and, other, times, were, only, a, ceremonial, union, to, consolidate, political, power, ptolemy, auletes, expressed, his, wish, for, cleopatra, and, her, brother, ptolemy, xiii, to, marry, and, rule, jointly, in, his, will, in, which, the, roman, senate, was, named, as, executor, giving, rome, further, control, over, the, ptolemies, and, thereby, the, fate, of, egypt, as, a, nation, after, the, death, of, their, father, cleopatra, vii, and, her, younger, brother, ptolemy, xiii, inherited, the, throne, and, were, married, their, marriage, was, only, nominal, however, and, their, relationship, soon, degenerated, cleopatra, was, stripped, of, authority, and, title, by, ptolemy, xiii, s, advisors, who, held, considerable, influence, over, the, young, king, fleeing, into, exile, cleopatra, attempted, to, raise, an, army, to, reclaim, the, throne, julius, caesar, left, rome, for, alexandria, in, 48, bc, in, order, to, quell, the, looming, civil, war, as, war, in, egypt, which, was, one, of, rome, s, greatest, suppliers, of, grain, and, other, expensive, goods, would, have, had, a, detrimental, effect, on, trade, with, rome, especially, on, rome, s, working, class, citizens, during, his, stay, in, the, alexandrian, palace, he, received, 22, year, old, cleopatra, allegedly, carried, to, him, in, secret, wrapped, in, a, carpet, caesar, agreed, to, support, cleopatra, s, claim, to, the, throne, ptolemy, xiii, and, his, advisors, fled, the, palace, turning, the, egyptian, forces, loyal, to, the, throne, against, caesar, and, cleopatra, who, barricaded, themselves, in, the, palace, complex, until, roman, reinforcements, could, arrive, to, combat, the, rebellion, known, afterward, as, the, battles, in, alexandria, ptolemy, xiii, s, forces, were, ultimately, defeated, at, the, battle, of, the, nile, and, the, king, was, killed, in, the, conflict, reportedly, drowning, in, the, nile, while, attempting, to, flee, with, his, remaining, army, in, the, summer, of, 47, bc, having, married, her, younger, brother, ptolemy, xiv, cleopatra, embarked, with, caesar, for, a, two, month, trip, along, the, nile, together, they, visited, dendara, where, cleopatra, was, being, worshiped, as, pharaoh, an, honor, beyond, caesar, s, reach, they, became, lovers, and, had, a, son, caesarion, in, 45, bc, cleopatra, and, caesarion, left, alexandria, for, rome, where, they, stayed, in, a, palace, built, by, caesar, in, their, honor, in, 44, bc, caesar, was, murdered, in, rome, by, several, senators, with, his, death, rome, split, between, supporters, of, mark, antony, and, octavian, when, mark, antony, seemed, to, prevail, cleopatra, supported, him, and, shortly, after, they, too, became, lovers, and, eventually, married, in, egypt, though, their, marriage, was, never, recognized, by, roman, law, as, antony, was, married, to, a, roman, woman, their, union, produced, three, children, the, twins, cleopatra, selene, and, alexander, helios, and, another, son, ptolemy, philadelphos, mark, antony, s, alliance, with, cleopatra, angered, rome, even, more, branded, a, power, hungry, enchantress, by, the, romans, she, was, accused, of, seducing, antony, to, further, her, conquest, of, rome, further, outrage, followed, at, the, donations, of, alexandria, ceremony, in, autumn, of, 34, bc, in, which, tarsus, cyrene, crete, cyprus, and, judaea, were, all, to, be, given, as, client, monarchies, to, antony, s, children, by, cleopatra, in, his, will, antony, expressed, his, desire, to, be, buried, in, alexandria, rather, than, taken, to, rome, in, the, event, of, his, death, which, octavian, used, against, antony, sowing, further, dissent, in, the, roman, populace, octavian, was, quick, to, declare, war, on, antony, and, cleopatra, while, public, opinion, of, antony, was, low, their, naval, forces, met, at, actium, where, the, forces, of, marcus, vipsanius, agrippa, defeated, the, navy, of, cleopatra, and, antony, octavian, waited, for, a, year, before, he, claimed, egypt, as, a, roman, province, he, arrived, in, alexandria, and, easily, defeated, mark, antony, s, remaining, forces, outside, the, city, facing, certain, death, at, the, hands, of, octavian, antony, attempted, suicide, by, falling, on, his, own, sword, but, survived, briefly, he, was, taken, by, his, remaining, soldiers, to, cleopatra, who, had, barricaded, herself, in, her, mausoleum, where, he, died, soon, after, knowing, that, she, would, be, taken, to, rome, to, be, paraded, in, octavian, s, triumph, and, likely, executed, thereafter, cleopatra, and, her, handmaidens, committed, suicide, on, 12, august, 30, bc, legend, and, numerous, ancient, sources, claim, that, she, died, by, way, of, the, venomous, bite, of, an, asp, though, others, state, that, she, used, poison, or, that, octavian, ordered, her, death, himself, caesarion, her, son, by, julius, caesar, nominally, succeeded, cleopatra, until, his, capture, and, supposed, execution, in, the, weeks, after, his, mother, s, death, cleopatra, s, children, by, antony, were, spared, by, octavian, and, given, to, his, sister, and, antony, s, roman, wife, octavia, minor, to, be, raised, in, her, household, no, further, mention, is, made, of, cleopatra, and, antony, s, sons, in, the, known, historical, texts, of, that, time, but, their, daughter, cleopatra, selene, was, eventually, married, through, arrangement, by, octavian, into, the, mauretanian, royal, line, one, of, rome, s, many, client, monarchies, through, cleopatra, selene, s, offspring, the, ptolemaic, line, intermarried, back, into, the, roman, nobility, for, centuries, with, the, deaths, of, cleopatra, and, caesarion, the, dynasty, of, ptolemies, and, the, entirety, of, pharaonic, egypt, came, to, an, end, alexandria, remained, the, capital, of, the, country, but, egypt, itself, became, a, roman, province, octavian, became, the, sole, ruler, of, rome, and, began, converting, it, into, a, monarchy, the, roman, empire, under, roman, rule, egypt, was, governed, by, a, prefect, selected, by, the, emperor, from, the, equestrian, class, and, not, a, governor, from, the, senatorial, order, to, prevent, interference, by, the, roman, senate, the, main, roman, interest, in, egypt, was, always, the, reliable, delivery, of, grain, to, the, city, of, rome, to, this, end, the, roman, administration, made, no, change, to, the, ptolemaic, system, of, government, although, romans, replaced, greeks, in, the, highest, offices, but, greeks, continued, to, staff, most, of, the, administrative, offices, and, greek, remained, the, language, of, government, except, at, the, highest, levels, unlike, the, greeks, the, romans, did, not, settle, in, egypt, in, large, numbers, culture, education, and, civic, life, largely, remained, greek, throughout, the, roman, period, the, romans, like, the, ptolemies, respected, and, protected, egyptian, religion, and, customs, although, the, cult, of, the, roman, state, and, of, the, emperor, was, gradually, introduced, ptolemy, i, perhaps, with, advice, from, demetrius, of, phalerum, founded, the, library, of, alexandria, a, research, centre, located, in, the, royal, sector, of, the, city, its, scholars, were, housed, in, the, same, sector, and, funded, by, ptolemaic, rulers, the, chief, librarian, served, also, as, the, crown, prince, s, tutor, for, the, first, hundred, and, fifty, years, of, its, existence, the, library, drew, the, top, greek, scholars, from, all, over, the, hellenistic, world, it, was, a, key, academic, literary, and, scientific, centre, in, antiquity, greek, culture, had, a, long, but, minor, presence, in, egypt, long, before, alexander, the, great, founded, the, city, of, alexandria, it, began, when, greek, colonists, encouraged, by, many, pharaohs, set, up, the, trading, post, of, naucratis, as, egypt, came, under, foreign, domination, and, decline, the, pharaohs, depended, on, the, greeks, as, mercenaries, and, even, advisors, when, the, persians, took, over, egypt, naucratis, remained, an, important, greek, port, and, the, colonist, population, were, used, as, mercenaries, by, both, the, rebel, egyptian, princes, and, the, persian, kings, who, later, gave, them, land, grants, spreading, greek, culture, into, the, valley, of, the, nile, when, alexander, the, great, arrived, he, established, alexandria, on, the, site, of, the, persian, fort, of, rhakortis, following, alexander, s, death, control, passed, into, the, hands, of, the, lagid, ptolemaic, dynasty, they, built, greek, cities, across, their, empire, and, gave, land, grants, across, egypt, to, the, veterans, of, their, many, military, conflicts, hellenistic, civilization, continued, to, thrive, even, after, rome, annexed, egypt, after, the, battle, of, actium, and, did, not, decline, until, the, islamic, conquests, ptolemaic, art, was, produced, during, the, reign, of, the, ptolemaic, rulers, 304, 30, bc, and, was, concentrated, primarily, within, the, bounds, of, the, ptolemaic, empire, at, first, artworks, existed, separately, in, either, the, egyptian, or, the, hellenistic, style, but, over, time, these, characteristics, began, to, combine, the, continuation, of, the, egyptian, art, style, evidences, the, ptolemies, commitment, to, maintaining, egyptian, customs, this, strategy, not, only, helped, to, legitimize, their, rule, but, also, placated, the, general, population, greek, style, art, was, also, created, during, this, time, and, existed, in, parallel, to, the, more, traditional, egyptian, art, which, could, not, be, altered, significantly, without, changing, its, intrinsic, primarily, religious, function, art, found, outside, of, egypt, itself, though, within, the, ptolemaic, kingdom, sometimes, used, egyptian, iconography, as, it, had, been, used, previously, and, sometimes, adapted, it, for, example, the, faience, sistrum, inscribed, with, the, name, of, ptolemy, has, some, deceptively, greek, characteristics, such, as, the, scrolls, at, the, top, however, there, are, many, examples, of, nearly, identical, sistrums, and, columns, dating, all, the, way, to, dynasty, 18, in, the, new, kingdom, it, is, therefore, purely, egyptian, in, style, aside, from, the, name, of, the, king, there, are, other, features, that, specifically, date, this, to, the, ptolemaic, period, most, distinctively, is, the, color, of, the, faience, apple, green, deep, blue, and, lavender, blue, are, the, three, colors, most, frequently, used, during, this, period, a, shift, from, the, characteristic, blue, of, the, earlier, kingdoms, this, sistrum, appears, to, be, an, intermediate, hue, which, fits, with, its, date, at, the, beginning, of, the, ptolemaic, empire, during, the, reign, of, ptolemy, ii, arsinoe, ii, was, deified, either, as, stand, alone, goddesses, or, as, a, personification, of, another, divine, figure, and, given, their, own, sanctuaries, and, festivals, in, association, to, both, egyptian, and, hellenistic, gods, such, as, isis, of, egypt, and, hera, of, greece, for, example, head, attributed, to, arsinoe, ii, deified, her, as, an, egyptian, goddess, however, the, marble, head, of, a, ptolemaic, queen, deified, arsinoe, ii, as, hera, coins, from, this, period, also, show, arsinoe, ii, with, a, diadem, that, is, solely, worn, by, goddesses, and, deified, royal, women, the, statuette, of, arsinoe, ii, was, created, c, 150, 100, bc, well, after, her, death, as, a, part, of, her, own, specific, posthumous, cult, which, was, started, by, her, husband, ptolemy, ii, the, figure, also, exemplifies, the, fusing, of, greek, and, egyptian, art, although, the, backpillar, and, the, goddess, s, striding, pose, is, distinctively, egyptian, the, cornucopia, she, holds, and, her, hairstyle, are, both, greek, in, style, the, rounded, eyes, prominent, lips, and, overall, youthful, features, show, greek, influence, as, well, despite, the, unification, of, greek, and, egyptian, elements, in, the, intermediate, ptolemaic, period, the, ptolemaic, kingdom, also, featured, prominent, temple, construction, as, a, continuation, of, developments, based, on, egyptian, art, tradition, from, the, thirtieth, dynasty, such, behavior, expanded, the, rulers, social, and, political, capital, and, demonstrated, their, loyalty, toward, egyptian, deities, to, the, satisfaction, of, the, local, people, temples, remained, very, new, kingdom, and, late, period, egyptian, in, style, though, resources, were, oftentimes, provided, by, foreign, powers, temples, were, models, of, the, cosmic, world, with, basic, plans, retaining, the, pylon, open, court, hypostyle, halls, and, dark, and, centrally, located, sanctuary, however, ways, of, presenting, text, on, columns, and, reliefs, became, formal, and, rigid, during, the, ptolemaic, dynasty, scenes, were, often, framed, with, textual, inscriptions, with, a, higher, text, to, image, ratio, than, seen, previously, during, the, new, kingdom, for, example, a, relief, in, the, temple, of, kom, ombo, is, separated, from, other, scenes, by, two, vertical, columns, of, texts, the, figures, in, the, scenes, are, smooth, rounded, and, high, relief, a, style, continued, throughout, the, 30th, dynasty, the, relief, represents, the, interaction, between, the, ptolemaic, kings, and, the, egyptian, deities, which, legitimized, their, rule, in, egypt, in, ptolemaic, art, the, idealism, seen, in, the, art, of, previous, dynasties, continues, with, some, alterations, women, are, portrayed, as, more, youthful, and, men, begin, to, be, portrayed, in, a, range, from, idealistic, to, realistic, an, example, of, realistic, portrayal, is, the, berlin, green, head, which, shows, the, non, idealistic, facial, features, with, vertical, lines, above, the, bridge, of, the, nose, lines, at, the, corners, of, the, eyes, and, between, the, nose, and, the, mouth, the, influence, of, greek, art, was, shown, in, an, emphasis, on, the, face, that, was, not, previously, present, in, egyptian, art, and, incorporation, of, greek, elements, into, an, egyptian, setting, individualistic, hairstyles, the, oval, face, round, deeply, set, eyes, and, the, small, tucked, mouth, closer, to, the, nose, early, portraits, of, the, ptolemies, featured, large, and, radiant, eyes, in, association, to, the, rulers, divinity, as, well, as, general, notions, of, abundance, when, ptolemy, i, soter, made, himself, king, of, egypt, he, created, a, new, god, serapis, to, garner, support, from, both, greeks, and, egyptians, serapis, was, the, patron, god, of, ptolemaic, egypt, combining, the, egyptian, gods, apis, and, osiris, with, the, greek, deities, zeus, hades, asklepios, dionysos, and, helios, he, had, powers, over, fertility, the, sun, funerary, rites, and, medicine, his, growth, and, popularity, reflected, a, deliberate, policy, by, the, ptolemaic, state, and, was, characteristic, of, the, dynasty, s, use, of, egyptian, religion, to, legitimize, their, rule, and, strengthen, their, control, the, cult, of, serapis, included, the, worship, of, the, new, ptolemaic, line, of, pharaohs, the, newly, established, hellenistic, capital, of, alexandria, supplanted, memphis, as, the, preeminent, religious, city, ptolemy, i, also, promoted, the, cult, of, the, deified, alexander, who, became, the, state, god, of, the, ptolemaic, kingdom, many, rulers, also, promoted, individual, cults, of, personality, including, celebrations, at, egyptian, temples, because, the, monarchy, remained, staunchly, hellenistic, despite, otherwise, co, opting, egyptian, faith, traditions, religion, during, this, period, was, highly, syncretic, the, wife, of, ptolemy, ii, arsinoe, ii, was, often, depicted, in, the, form, of, the, greek, goddess, aphrodite, but, she, wore, the, crown, of, lower, egypt, with, ram, s, horns, ostrich, feathers, and, other, traditional, egyptian, indicators, of, royalty, and, or, deification, she, wore, the, vulture, headdress, only, on, the, religious, portion, of, a, relief, cleopatra, vii, the, last, of, the, ptolemaic, line, was, often, depicted, with, characteristics, of, the, goddess, isis, she, usually, had, either, a, small, throne, as, her, headdress, or, the, more, traditional, sun, disk, between, two, horns, reflecting, greek, preferences, the, traditional, table, for, offerings, disappeared, from, reliefs, during, the, ptolemaic, period, while, male, gods, were, no, longer, portrayed, with, tails, so, as, to, make, them, more, human, like, in, accordance, with, the, hellenistic, tradition, nevertheless, the, ptolemies, remained, generally, supportive, of, the, egyptian, religion, which, always, remained, key, to, their, legitimacy, egyptian, priests, and, other, religious, authorities, enjoyed, royal, patronage, and, support, more, or, less, retaining, their, historical, privileged, status, temples, remained, the, focal, point, of, social, economic, and, cultural, life, the, first, three, reigns, of, the, dynasty, were, characterized, by, rigorous, temple, building, including, the, completion, of, projects, left, over, from, the, previous, dynasty, many, older, or, neglected, structures, were, restored, or, enhanced, the, ptolemies, generally, adhered, to, traditional, architectural, styles, and, motifs, in, many, respects, the, egyptian, religion, thrived, temples, became, centers, of, learning, and, literature, in, the, traditional, egyptian, style, the, worship, of, isis, and, horus, became, more, popular, as, did, the, practice, of, offering, animal, mummies, memphis, while, no, longer, the, center, of, power, became, the, second, city, after, alexandria, and, enjoyed, considerable, influence, its, high, priests, of, ptah, an, ancient, egyptian, creator, god, held, considerable, sway, among, the, priesthood, and, even, with, the, ptolemaic, kings, saqqara, the, city, s, necropolis, was, a, leading, center, of, worship, of, apis, bull, which, had, become, integrated, into, the, national, mythos, the, ptolemies, also, lavished, attention, on, hermopolis, the, cult, center, of, thoth, building, a, hellenistic, style, temple, in, his, honor, thebes, continued, to, be, a, major, religious, center, and, home, to, a, powerful, priesthood, it, also, enjoyed, royal, development, namely, of, the, karnak, complex, devoted, to, the, osiris, and, khonsu, the, city, s, temples, and, communities, prosperous, while, a, new, ptolemaic, style, of, cemeteries, were, built, a, common, stele, that, appears, during, the, ptolemaic, dynasty, is, the, cippus, a, type, of, religious, object, produced, for, the, purpose, of, protecting, individuals, these, magical, stelae, were, made, of, various, materials, such, as, limestone, chlorite, schist, and, metagreywacke, and, were, connected, with, matters, of, health, and, safety, horus, on, the, crocodiles, cippi, during, the, ptolemaic, period, generally, featured, the, child, form, of, the, egyptian, god, horus, horpakhered, or, harpocrates, this, portrayal, refers, to, the, myth, of, horus, triumphing, over, dangerous, animals, in, the, marshes, of, khemmis, with, magic, power, also, known, as, akhmim, ptolemaic, egypt, was, highly, stratified, in, terms, of, both, class, and, language, more, than, any, previous, foreign, rulers, the, ptolemies, retained, or, co, opted, many, aspects, of, the, egyptian, social, order, using, egyptian, religion, traditions, and, political, structures, to, increase, their, own, power, and, wealth, as, before, peasant, farmers, remained, the, vast, majority, of, the, population, while, agricultural, land, and, produce, were, owned, directly, by, the, state, temple, or, noble, family, that, owned, the, land, macedonians, and, other, greeks, now, formed, the, new, upper, classes, replacing, the, old, native, aristocracy, a, complex, state, bureaucracy, was, established, to, manage, and, extract, egypt, s, vast, wealth, for, the, benefit, of, the, ptolemies, and, the, landed, gentry, greeks, held, virtually, all, the, political, and, economic, power, while, native, egyptians, generally, occupied, only, the, lower, posts, over, time, egyptians, who, spoke, greek, were, able, to, advance, further, and, many, individuals, identified, as, greek, were, of, egyptian, descent, eventually, a, bilingual, and, bicultural, social, class, emerged, in, ptolemaic, egypt, priests, and, other, religious, officials, remained, overwhelmingly, egyptian, and, continued, to, enjoy, royal, patronage, and, social, prestige, as, the, ptolemies, relied, on, the, egyptian, faith, to, legitimize, their, rule, and, placate, the, populace, although, egypt, was, a, prosperous, kingdom, with, the, ptolemies, lavishing, patronage, through, religious, monuments, and, public, works, the, native, population, enjoyed, few, benefits, wealth, and, power, remained, overwhelmingly, in, the, hands, of, greeks, subsequently, uprising, and, social, unrest, were, frequent, especially, by, the, early, third, century, bc, egyptian, nationalism, reached, a, peak, in, the, reign, of, ptolemy, iv, philopator, 221, 205, bc, when, a, succession, of, native, self, proclaimed, pharaoh, gained, control, over, one, district, this, was, only, curtailed, nineteen, years, later, when, ptolemy, v, epiphanes, 205, 181, bc, succeeded, in, subduing, them, though, underlying, grievances, were, never, extinguished, and, riots, erupted, again, later, in, the, dynasty, ptolemaic, egypt, produced, extensive, series, of, coinage, in, gold, silver, and, bronze, these, included, issues, of, large, coins, in, all, three, metals, most, notably, gold, penta, drachm, and, octadrachm, and, silver, tetradrachm, decadrachm, and, pentakaidecadrachm, the, military, of, ptolemaic, egypt, is, considered, to, have, been, one, of, the, best, of, the, hellenistic, period, benefiting, from, the, kingdom, s, vast, resources, and, its, ability, to, adapt, to, changing, circumstances, the, ptolemaic, military, initially, served, a, defensive, purpose, primarily, against, competing, diadochi, claimants, and, rival, hellenistic, states, like, the, seleucid, empire, by, the, reign, of, ptolemy, iii, 246, to, 222, bc, its, role, was, more, imperialistic, helping, extend, ptolemaic, control, or, influence, over, cyrenaica, coele, syria, and, cyprus, as, well, as, over, cities, in, anatolia, southern, thrace, the, aegean, islands, and, crete, the, military, expanded, and, secured, these, territories, while, continuing, its, primary, function, of, protecting, egypt, its, main, garrisons, were, in, alexandria, pelusium, in, the, delta, and, elephantine, in, upper, egypt, the, ptolemies, also, relied, on, the, military, to, assert, and, maintain, their, control, over, egypt, often, by, virtue, of, their, presence, soldiers, served, in, several, units, of, the, royal, guard, and, were, mobilized, against, uprisings, and, dynastic, usurpers, both, of, which, became, increasingly, common, members, of, the, army, such, as, the, machimoi, low, ranking, native, soldiers, were, sometimes, recruited, as, guards, for, officials, or, even, to, help, enforce, tax, collection, the, ptolemies, maintained, a, standing, army, throughout, their, reign, made, up, of, both, professional, soldiers, including, mercenaries, and, recruits, from, the, very, beginning, the, ptolemaic, army, demonstrated, considerable, resourcefulness, and, adaptability, in, his, fight, for, control, over, egypt, ptolemy, i, had, relied, on, a, combination, of, imported, greek, troops, mercenaries, native, egyptians, and, even, prisoners, of, war, the, army, was, characterized, by, its, diversity, and, maintained, records, of, its, troops, national, origins, or, patris, in, addition, to, egypt, itself, soldiers, were, recruited, from, macedonia, cyrenaica, modern, libya, mainland, greece, the, aegean, asia, minor, and, thrace, overseas, territories, were, often, garrisoned, with, local, soldiers, by, the, second, and, first, centuries, bc, increasing, warfare, and, expansion, coupled, with, reduced, greek, immigration, led, to, increasing, reliance, on, native, egyptians, however, greeks, retained, the, higher, ranks, of, royal, guards, officers, and, generals, though, present, in, the, military, from, its, founding, native, troops, were, sometimes, looked, down, upon, and, distrusted, due, to, their, reputation, for, disloyalty, and, tendency, to, aid, local, revolts, however, they, were, well, regarded, as, fighters, and, beginning, with, the, reforms, of, ptolemy, v, in, the, early, third, century, bc, they, appeared, more, frequently, as, officers, and, cavalrymen, egyptian, soldiers, also, enjoyed, a, socioeconomic, status, higher, than, the, average, native, to, obtain, reliable, and, loyal, soldiers, the, ptolemies, developed, several, strategies, that, leveraged, their, ample, financial, resources, and, even, egypt, s, historical, reputation, for, wealth, royal, propaganda, could, be, evidenced, in, a, line, by, the, poet, theocritus, ptolemy, is, the, best, paymaster, a, free, man, could, have, mercenaries, were, paid, a, salary, misthos, of, cash, and, grain, rations, an, infantryman, in, the, third, century, bc, earned, about, one, silver, drachma, daily, this, attracted, recruits, from, across, the, eastern, mediterranean, who, were, sometimes, referred, to, misthophoroi, xenoi, literally, foreigners, paid, with, a, salary, by, the, second, and, first, century, bc, misthophoroi, were, mainly, recruited, within, egypt, notably, among, the, egyptian, population, soldiers, were, also, given, land, grants, called, kleroi, whose, size, varied, according, to, the, military, rank, and, unit, as, well, as, stathmoi, or, residences, which, were, sometimes, in, the, home, of, local, inhabitants, men, who, settled, in, egypt, through, these, grants, were, known, as, cleruchs, at, least, from, about, 230, bc, these, land, grants, were, provided, to, machimoi, lower, ranking, infantry, usually, of, egyptian, origin, who, received, smaller, lots, comparable, to, traditional, land, allotments, in, egypt, kleroi, grants, could, be, extensive, a, cavalryman, could, receive, at, least, 70, arouras, of, land, equal, to, about, 178, 920, square, metres, and, as, much, as, 100, arouras, infantrymen, could, expect, 30, or, 25, arouras, and, machimoi, at, least, five, auroras, considered, enough, for, one, family, the, lucrative, nature, of, military, service, under, the, ptolemies, appeared, to, have, been, effective, at, ensuring, loyalty, few, mutinies, and, revolts, are, recorded, and, even, rebellious, troops, would, be, placated, with, land, grants, and, other, incentives, as, in, other, hellenistic, states, the, ptolemaic, army, inherited, the, doctrines, and, organization, of, macedonia, albeit, with, some, variations, over, time, the, core, of, the, army, consisted, of, cavalry, and, infantry, as, under, alexander, cavalry, played, a, larger, role, both, numerically, and, tactically, while, the, macedonian, phalanx, served, as, the, primary, infantry, formation, the, multiethnic, nature, of, the, ptolemaic, army, was, an, official, organizational, principle, soldiers, were, evidently, trained, and, utilized, based, on, their, national, origin, cretans, generally, served, as, archers, libyans, as, heavy, infantry, and, thracians, as, cavalry, similarly, units, were, grouped, and, equipped, based, on, ethnicity, nevertheless, different, nationalities, were, trained, to, fight, together, and, most, officers, were, of, greek, or, macedonian, origin, which, allowed, for, a, degree, of, cohesion, and, coordination, military, leadership, and, the, figure, of, the, king, and, queen, were, central, for, ensuring, unity, and, morale, among, multiethnic, troops, at, the, battle, of, raphia, the, presence, of, ptolemy, was, reportedly, critical, in, maintaining, and, boosting, the, fighting, spirit, of, both, greek, and, egyptian, soldiers, the, ptolemaic, kingdom, was, considered, a, major, naval, power, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, some, modern, historians, characterize, egypt, during, this, period, as, a, thalassocracy, owing, to, its, innovation, of, traditional, styles, of, mediterranean, sea, power, which, allowed, its, rulers, to, exert, power, and, influence, in, unprecedented, ways, with, territories, and, vassals, spread, across, the, eastern, mediterranean, including, cyprus, crete, the, aegean, islands, and, thrace, the, ptolemies, required, a, large, navy, to, defend, against, enemies, like, the, seleucids, and, macedonians, the, ptolemaic, navy, also, protected, the, kingdom, s, lucrative, maritime, trade, and, engaged, in, antipiracy, measures, including, along, the, nile, like, the, army, the, origins, and, traditions, of, the, ptolemaic, navy, were, rooted, in, the, wars, following, the, death, of, alexander, in, 320, bc, various, diadochi, competed, for, naval, supremacy, over, the, aegean, and, eastern, mediterranean, and, ptolemy, i, founded, the, navy, to, help, defend, egypt, and, consolidate, his, control, against, invading, rivals, he, and, his, immediate, successors, turned, to, developing, the, navy, to, project, power, overseas, rather, than, build, a, land, empire, in, greece, or, asia, notwithstanding, an, early, crushing, defeat, at, the, battle, of, salamis, in, 306, bc, the, ptolemaic, navy, became, the, dominant, maritime, force, in, the, aegean, and, eastern, mediterranean, for, the, next, several, decades, ptolemy, ii, maintained, his, father, s, policy, of, making, egypt, the, preeminent, naval, power, in, the, region, during, his, reign, 283, to, 246, bc, the, ptolemaic, navy, became, the, largest, in, the, hellenistic, world, and, had, some, of, the, largest, warships, ever, built, in, antiquity, the, navy, reached, its, height, following, the, victory, of, ptolemy, ii, during, the, first, syrian, war, 274, 271, bc, succeeding, in, repelling, both, seleucid, and, macedonian, control, of, the, eastern, mediterranean, and, the, aegean, during, the, subsequent, chremonidean, war, the, ptolemaic, navy, succeeded, in, blockading, macedonia, and, containing, its, imperial, ambitions, to, mainland, greece, beginning, with, the, second, syrian, war, 260, 253, bc, the, navy, suffered, a, series, of, defeats, and, declined, in, military, importance, which, coincided, with, the, loss, of, egypt, s, overseas, possessions, and, the, erosion, of, its, maritime, hegemony, the, navy, was, relegated, primarily, to, a, protective, and, antipiracy, role, for, the, next, two, centuries, until, its, partial, revival, under, cleopatra, vii, who, sought, to, restore, ptolemaic, naval, supremacy, amid, the, rise, of, rome, as, a, major, mediterranean, power, egyptian, naval, forces, took, part, in, the, decisive, battle, of, actium, during, the, final, war, of, the, roman, republic, but, once, again, suffered, a, defeat, that, culminated, with, the, end, of, ptolemaic, rule, at, its, apex, under, ptolemy, ii, the, ptolemaic, navy, may, have, had, as, many, as, 336, warships, with, ptolemy, ii, reportedly, having, at, his, disposal, more, than, 4, 000, ships, including, transports, and, allied, vessels, maintaining, a, fleet, of, this, size, would, have, been, costly, and, reflected, the, vast, wealth, and, resources, of, the, kingdom, the, main, naval, bases, were, at, alexandria, and, nea, paphos, in, cyprus, the, navy, operated, throughout, the, eastern, mediterranean, aegean, sea, and, levantine, sea, and, along, the, nile, patrolling, as, far, as, the, red, sea, towards, the, indian, ocean, accordingly, naval, forces, were, divided, into, four, fleets, the, alexandrian, aegean, red, sea, and, nile, river, while, ruling, egypt, the, ptolemaic, dynasty, built, many, greek, settlements, throughout, their, empire, to, either, hellenize, new, conquered, peoples, or, reinforce, the, area, egypt, had, only, three, main, greek, cities, alexandria, naucratis, and, ptolemais, of, the, three, greek, cities, naucratis, although, its, commercial, importance, was, reduced, with, the, founding, of, alexandria, continued, in, a, quiet, way, its, life, as, a, greek, city, state, during, the, interval, between, the, death, of, alexander, and, ptolemy, s, assumption, of, the, style, of, king, it, even, issued, an, autonomous, coinage, and, the, number, of, greek, men, of, letters, during, the, ptolemaic, and, roman, period, who, were, citizens, of, naucratis, proves, that, in, the, sphere, of, hellenic, culture, naucratis, held, to, its, traditions, ptolemy, ii, bestowed, his, care, upon, naucratis, he, built, a, large, structure, of, limestone, about, 100, metres, 330, ft, long, and, 18, metres, 59, ft, wide, to, fill, up, the, broken, entrance, to, the, great, temenos, he, strengthened, the, great, block, of, chambers, in, the, temenos, and, re, established, them, at, the, time, when, sir, flinders, petrie, wrote, the, words, just, quoted, the, great, temenos, was, identified, with, the, hellenion, but, mr, edgar, has, recently, pointed, out, that, the, building, connected, with, it, was, an, egyptian, temple, not, a, greek, building, naucratis, therefore, in, spite, of, its, general, hellenic, character, had, an, egyptian, element, that, the, city, flourished, in, ptolemaic, times, we, may, see, by, the, quantity, of, imported, amphorae, of, which, the, handles, stamped, at, rhodes, and, elsewhere, are, found, so, abundantly, the, zeno, papyri, show, that, it, was, the, chief, port, of, call, on, the, inland, voyage, from, memphis, to, alexandria, as, well, as, a, stopping, place, on, the, land, route, from, pelusium, to, the, capital, it, was, attached, in, the, administrative, system, to, the, sa, te, nome, a, major, mediterranean, port, of, egypt, in, ancient, times, and, still, today, alexandria, was, founded, in, 331, bc, by, alexander, the, great, according, to, plutarch, the, alexandrians, believed, that, alexander, the, great, s, motivation, to, build, the, city, was, his, wish, to, found, a, large, and, populous, greek, city, that, should, bear, his, name, located, 30, kilometres, 19, mi, west, of, the, nile, s, westernmost, mouth, the, city, was, immune, to, the, silt, deposits, that, persistently, choked, harbors, along, the, river, alexandria, became, the, capital, of, the, hellenized, egypt, of, king, ptolemy, i, reigned, 323, 283, bc, under, the, wealthy, ptolemaic, dynasty, the, city, soon, surpassed, athens, as, the, cultural, center, of, the, hellenic, world, laid, out, on, a, grid, pattern, alexandria, occupied, a, stretch, of, land, between, the, sea, to, the, north, and, lake, mareotis, to, the, south, a, man, made, causeway, over, three, quarters, of, a, mile, long, extended, north, to, the, sheltering, island, of, pharos, thus, forming, a, double, harbor, east, and, west, on, the, east, was, the, main, harbor, called, the, great, harbor, it, faced, the, city, s, chief, buildings, including, the, royal, palace, and, the, famous, library, and, museum, at, the, great, harbor, s, mouth, on, an, outcropping, of, pharos, stood, the, lighthouse, built, c, 280, bc, now, vanished, the, lighthouse, was, reckoned, as, one, of, the, seven, wonders, of, the, world, for, its, unsurpassed, height, perhaps, 140, metres, or, 460, ft, it, was, a, square, fenestrated, tower, topped, with, a, metal, fire, basket, and, a, statue, of, zeus, the, savior, the, library, at, that, time, the, largest, in, the, world, contained, several, hundred, thousand, volumes, and, housed, and, employed, scholars, and, poets, a, similar, scholarly, complex, was, the, museum, mouseion, hall, of, the, muses, during, alexandria, s, brief, literary, golden, period, c, 280, 240, bc, the, library, subsidized, three, poets, callimachus, apollonius, of, rhodes, and, theocritus, whose, work, now, represents, the, best, of, hellenistic, literature, among, other, thinkers, associated, with, the, library, or, other, alexandrian, patronage, were, the, mathematician, euclid, c, 300, bc, the, inventor, archimedes, 287, bc, c, 212, bc, and, the, polymath, eratosthenes, c, 225, bc, cosmopolitan, and, flourishing, alexandria, possessed, a, varied, population, of, greeks, egyptians, and, other, oriental, peoples, including, a, sizable, minority, of, jews, who, had, their, own, city, quarter, periodic, conflicts, occurred, between, jews, and, ethnic, greeks, according, to, strabo, alexandria, had, been, inhabited, during, polybius, lifetime, by, local, egyptians, foreign, mercenaries, and, the, tribe, of, the, alexandrians, whose, origin, and, customs, polybius, identified, as, greek, the, city, enjoyed, a, calm, political, history, under, the, ptolemies, it, passed, with, the, rest, of, egypt, into, roman, hands, in, 30, bc, and, became, the, second, city, of, the, roman, empire, the, second, greek, city, founded, after, the, conquest, of, egypt, was, ptolemais, 400, miles, 640, km, up, the, nile, where, there, was, a, native, village, called, pso, in, the, nome, called, after, the, ancient, egyptian, city, of, thinis, if, alexandria, perpetuated, the, name, and, cult, of, the, great, alexander, ptolemais, was, to, perpetuate, the, name, and, cult, of, the, founder, of, the, ptolemaic, time, framed, in, by, the, barren, hills, of, the, nile, valley, and, the, egyptian, sky, here, a, greek, city, arose, with, its, public, buildings, and, temples, and, theatre, no, doubt, exhibiting, the, regular, architectural, forms, associated, with, greek, culture, with, a, citizen, body, greek, in, blood, and, the, institutions, of, a, greek, city, if, there, is, some, doubt, whether, alexandria, possessed, a, council, and, assembly, there, is, none, in, regard, to, ptolemais, it, was, more, possible, for, the, kings, to, allow, a, measure, of, self, government, to, a, people, removed, at, that, distance, from, the, ordinary, residence, of, the, court, we, have, still, inscribed, on, stone, decrees, passed, in, the, assembly, of, the, people, of, ptolemais, couched, in, the, regular, forms, of, greek, political, tradition, it, seemed, good, to, the, boule, and, to, the, demos, hermas, son, of, doreon, of, the, deme, megisteus, was, the, proposer, whereas, the, prytaneis, who, were, colleagues, with, dionysius, the, son, of, musaeus, in, the, 8th, year, etc, the, ptolemaic, kingdom, was, diverse, and, cosmopolitan, beginning, under, ptolemy, i, soter, macedonians, and, other, greeks, were, given, land, grants, and, allowed, to, settle, with, their, families, encouraging, tens, of, thousands, of, greek, mercenaries, and, soldiers, to, immigrate, where, they, became, a, landed, class, of, royal, soldiers, greeks, soon, became, the, dominant, elite, native, egyptians, though, always, the, majority, generally, occupied, lower, posts, in, the, ptolemaic, government, over, time, the, greeks, in, egypt, became, somewhat, homogenized, and, the, cultural, distinctions, between, immigrants, from, different, regions, of, greece, became, blurred, many, jews, were, imported, from, neighboring, judea, by, the, thousands, for, being, renowned, fighters, also, establishing, an, important, community, other, foreign, groups, settled, from, across, the, ancient, world, usually, as, cleruchs, who, had, been, granted, land, in, exchange, for, military, service, of, the, many, foreign, groups, who, had, come, to, settle, in, egypt, the, greeks, were, the, most, privileged, they, were, partly, spread, as, allotment, holders, over, the, country, forming, social, groups, in, the, country, towns, and, villages, side, by, side, with, the, native, population, partly, gathered, in, the, three, greek, cities, the, old, naucratis, founded, before, 600, bc, in, the, interval, of, egyptian, independence, after, the, expulsion, of, the, assyrians, and, before, the, coming, of, the, persians, and, the, two, new, cities, alexandria, by, the, sea, and, ptolemais, in, upper, egypt, alexander, and, his, seleucid, successors, founded, many, greek, cities, all, over, their, dominions, greek, culture, was, so, much, bound, up, with, the, life, of, the, city, state, that, any, king, who, wanted, to, present, himself, to, the, world, as, a, genuine, champion, of, hellenism, had, to, do, something, in, this, direction, but, the, king, of, egypt, ambitious, to, shine, as, a, hellene, would, find, greek, cities, with, their, republican, tradition, and, aspirations, to, independence, inconvenient, elements, in, a, country, that, lent, itself, as, no, other, did, to, bureaucratic, centralization, the, ptolemies, therefore, limited, the, number, of, greek, city, states, in, egypt, to, alexandria, ptolemais, and, naucratis, outside, of, egypt, the, ptolemies, exercised, control, over, greek, cities, in, cyrenaica, cyprus, and, on, the, coasts, and, islands, of, the, aegean, but, they, were, smaller, than, greek, poleis, in, egypt, there, were, indeed, country, towns, with, names, such, as, ptolemais, arsinoe, and, berenice, in, which, greek, communities, existed, with, a, certain, social, life, and, there, were, similar, groups, of, greeks, in, many, of, the, old, egyptian, towns, but, they, were, not, communities, with, the, political, forms, of, a, city, state, yet, if, they, had, no, place, of, political, assembly, they, often, had, their, own, gymnasium, the, essential, sign, of, hellenism, serving, something, of, the, purpose, of, a, university, for, the, young, men, far, up, the, nile, at, ombi, a, gymnasium, of, the, local, greeks, was, found, in, 136, 135, bc, which, passed, resolutions, and, corresponded, with, the, king, also, in, 123, bc, when, there, was, trouble, in, upper, egypt, between, the, towns, of, crocodilopolis, and, hermonthis, the, negotiators, sent, from, crocodilopolis, were, the, young, men, attached, to, the, gymnasium, who, according, to, the, greek, tradition, ate, bread, and, salt, with, the, negotiators, from, the, other, town, all, the, greek, dialects, of, the, greek, world, gradually, became, assimilated, in, the, koine, greek, dialect, that, was, the, common, language, of, the, hellenistic, world, generally, the, greeks, of, ptolemaic, egypt, felt, like, representatives, of, a, higher, civilization, but, were, curious, about, the, native, culture, of, egypt, the, jews, who, lived, in, egypt, had, originally, immigrated, from, the, southern, levant, within, a, few, generations, the, jews, spoke, greek, the, dominant, language, of, egypt, at, the, time, and, not, the, hebrew, or, aramaic, of, the, first, immigrants, according, to, jewish, legend, the, septuagint, the, greek, translation, of, the, jewish, scriptures, was, written, by, seventy, two, jewish, translators, for, ptolemy, ii, that, is, confirmed, by, historian, flavius, josephus, who, writes, that, ptolemy, desirous, to, collect, every, book, in, the, habitable, earth, applied, demetrius, phalereus, to, the, task, of, organizing, an, effort, with, the, jewish, high, priests, to, translate, the, jewish, books, of, the, law, for, his, library, josephus, thus, places, the, origins, of, the, septuagint, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, when, demetrius, and, ptolemy, ii, lived, according, to, one, jewish, legend, the, seventy, wrote, their, translations, independently, from, memory, and, the, resultant, works, were, identical, at, every, letter, however, josephus, states, they, worked, together, arguing, over, the, translation, and, finished, the, work, in, 72, days, josephus, goes, into, great, detail, on, the, elaborate, preparations, and, regal, treatment, of, the, 70, elders, of, the, tribes, of, israel, chosen, to, accomplish, the, task, in, his, antiquities, of, the, jews, book, 12, chapter, 2, which, is, dedicated, to, the, description, of, this, famous, event, in, 1990, more, than, 2, 000, papyri, written, by, zeno, of, caunus, from, the, time, of, ptolemy, ii, philadelphus, were, discovered, which, contained, at, least, 19, references, to, arabs, in, the, area, between, the, nile, and, the, red, sea, and, mentioned, their, jobs, as, police, officers, in, charge, of, ten, person, units, and, some, others, were, mentioned, as, shepherds, arabs, in, ptolemaic, egypt, and, syria, raided, and, attacked, both, sides, of, the, conflict, between, the, ptolemaic, kingdom, and, its, enemies, the, early, ptolemies, increased, cultivatable, land, through, irrigation, and, land, reclamation, the, ptolemies, drained, the, marshes, of, the, faiyum, to, create, a, new, province, of, cultivatable, land, they, also, introduced, crops, such, as, durum, wheat, and, intensified, the, production, of, goods, such, as, wool, wine, production, increased, dramatically, during, the, ptolemaic, period, as, the, new, greek, ruling, class, greatly, preferred, wine, to, the, beer, traditionally, produced, in, egypt, vines, from, regions, like, crete, were, planted, in, egypt, in, an, attempt, to, produce, greek, wines
