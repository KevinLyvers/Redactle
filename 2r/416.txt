foundation, of, the, russian, empire, by, peter, the, great, in, 1721, from, 1550, to, 1700, russia, grew, by, an, average, of, 35, 000, square, kilometres, 14, 000, sq, mi, per, year, the, period, includes, the, upheavals, of, the, transition, from, the, rurik, to, the, romanov, dynasties, wars, with, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, sweden, and, the, ottoman, empire, and, the, russian, conquest, of, siberia, to, the, reign, of, peter, the, great, who, took, power, in, 1689, and, transformed, the, tsardom, into, an, empire, during, the, great, northern, war, he, implemented, substantial, reforms, and, proclaimed, the, russian, empire, after, victory, over, sweden, in, 1721, while, the, oldest, endonyms, of, the, grand, duchy, of, moscow, used, in, its, documents, were, rus, and, the, russian, land, russkaya, zemlya, a, new, form, of, its, name, in, russian, became, common, by, the, 15th, century, the, vernacular, rus, was, transformed, into, rus, s, iya, or, ros, s, iya, based, on, the, greek, name, for, rus, in, the, 1480s, russian, state, scribes, ivan, cherny, and, mikhail, medovartsev, mention, russia, under, the, name, rosia, and, medovartsev, also, mentions, the, sceptre, of, russian, lordship, rosiyskago, gospodstva, in, the, following, century, the, new, forms, co, existed, with, rus, and, appeared, in, an, inscription, on, the, western, portal, of, the, transfiguration, cathedral, of, the, spaso, preobrazhensky, monastery, in, yaroslavl, 1515, on, the, icon, case, of, the, theotokos, of, vladimir, 1514, in, the, work, by, maximus, the, greek, the, russian, chronograph, written, by, dosifei, toporkov, died, 1543, or, 1544, in, 1516, 1522, and, in, other, sources, on, 16, january, 1547, ivan, iv, was, crowned, the, tsar, and, grand, prince, of, all, russia, tsar, i, velikiy, knyaz, vseya, rusi, thereby, proclaiming, the, tsardom, of, russia, or, the, great, russian, tsardom, as, it, was, called, in, the, coronation, document, by, constantinople, patriarch, jeremiah, ii, and, in, numerous, official, texts, the, formula, in, manuscripts, to, all, his, state, of, great, russia, later, replaced, those, found, in, other, manuscripts, to, all, the, russian, realm, vo, vse, rossisskoe, tsarstvo, the, former, is, more, typical, of, the, 17th, century, when, the, usage, of, the, term, great, russia, velikaya, rossiya, became, widely, established, by, the, 17th, century, the, form, rossiya, replaced, rus, to, describe, the, extent, of, the, tsar, s, imperial, authority, in, chiny, with, feodor, iii, using, the, term, great, russian, tsardom, velikorossisskoe, tsarstvie, to, denote, an, imperial, and, absolutist, state, subordinating, both, russian, and, non, russian, territories, the, old, name, rus, was, replaced, in, official, documents, though, the, names, rus, and, russian, land, were, still, common, and, synonymous, to, it, the, russian, state, partly, remained, referred, to, as, moscovia, english, muscovy, throughout, europe, predominantly, in, its, catholic, part, though, this, latin, term, was, never, used, in, russia, the, two, names, russia, and, moscovia, appear, to, have, co, existed, as, interchangeable, during, the, late, 16th, century, and, throughout, the, 17th, century, with, different, western, maps, and, sources, using, different, names, so, that, the, country, was, called, russia, or, moscovia, latin, russia, seu, moscovia, or, russia, popularly, known, as, moscovia, latin, russia, vulgo, moscovia, in, england, in, the, 16th, century, it, was, known, both, as, russia, and, muscovy, such, notable, englishmen, as, giles, fletcher, author, of, the, book, of, the, russe, common, wealth, 1591, and, samuel, collins, author, of, the, present, state, of, russia, 1668, both, of, whom, visited, russia, were, familiar, with, the, term, russia, and, used, it, in, their, works, so, did, numerous, other, authors, including, john, milton, who, wrote, a, brief, history, of, moscovia, and, of, other, less, known, countries, lying, eastward, of, russia, published, posthumously, starting, it, with, the, words, the, empire, of, moscovia, or, as, others, call, it, russia, according, to, prominent, historians, like, alexander, zimin, and, anna, khoroshkevich, the, continuous, use, of, the, term, moscovia, was, a, result, of, traditional, habit, and, the, need, to, distinguish, between, the, muscovite, and, the, lithuanian, part, of, rus, as, well, as, of, the, political, interests, of, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, which, competed, with, moscow, for, the, western, regions, of, rus, due, to, the, propaganda, of, the, commonwealth, as, well, as, of, the, jesuits, the, term, moscovia, was, used, instead, of, russia, in, many, parts, of, europe, where, prior, to, the, reign, of, peter, the, great, there, was, a, lack, of, direct, knowledge, of, the, country, in, northern, europe, and, at, the, court, of, the, holy, roman, empire, however, the, country, was, known, under, its, own, name, russia, or, rossia, sigismund, von, herberstein, ambassador, of, the, holy, roman, emperor, in, russia, used, both, russia, and, moscovia, in, his, work, on, the, russian, tsardom, and, noted, the, majority, believes, that, russia, is, a, changed, name, of, roxolania, muscovites, russians, in, the, german, version, refute, this, saying, that, their, country, was, originally, called, russia, rosseia, pointing, to, the, difference, between, latin, and, russian, names, french, captain, jacques, margeret, who, served, in, russia, and, left, a, detailed, description, of, l, empire, de, russie, of, the, early, 17th, century, that, was, presented, to, king, henry, iv, stated, that, foreigners, make, a, mistake, when, they, call, them, muscovites, and, not, russians, when, they, are, asked, what, nation, they, are, they, respond, russac, which, means, russians, and, when, they, are, asked, what, place, they, are, from, the, answer, is, moscow, vologda, ryasan, and, other, cities, the, closest, analogue, of, the, latin, term, moscovia, in, russia, was, tsardom, of, moscow, or, moscow, tsardom, moskovskoye, tsarstvo, which, was, used, along, with, the, name, russia, sometimes, in, one, sentence, as, in, the, name, of, the, 17th, century, russian, work, on, the, great, and, glorious, russian, moscow, state, o, velikom, i, slavnom, rossiyskom, moskovskom, gosudarstve, by, the, 16th, century, the, russian, ruler, had, emerged, as, a, powerful, autocratic, figure, a, tsar, by, assuming, that, title, the, sovereign, of, moscow, tried, to, emphasize, that, he, was, a, major, ruler, or, emperor, tsar, represents, the, slavic, adaptation, of, the, roman, imperial, title, name, caesar, on, a, par, with, the, byzantine, emperor, indeed, after, ivan, iii, married, sophia, palaiologina, the, niece, of, the, late, byzantine, emperor, constantine, xi, palaiologos, in, 1472, the, moscow, court, adopted, byzantine, terms, rituals, titles, and, emblems, such, as, the, double, headed, eagle, which, survives, in, the, coat, of, arms, of, russia, at, first, the, byzantine, term, autokrator, expressed, only, the, literal, meaning, of, an, independent, ruler, but, in, the, reign, of, ivan, iv, 1533, 1584, it, came, to, imply, unlimited, autocratic, rule, in, 1547, the, grand, duke, ivan, iv, was, crowned, tsar, and, thus, was, recognized, at, least, by, the, russian, orthodox, church, as, emperor, notably, the, hegumen, philotheus, of, pskov, claimed, in, 1510, that, after, constantinople, fell, to, the, ottoman, empire, in, 1453, the, russian, tsar, remained, the, only, legitimate, orthodox, ruler, and, that, moscow, was, the, third, rome, becoming, the, final, lineal, successor, to, rome, and, constantinople, these, were, the, two, centers, of, christianity, and, of, the, roman, empires, western, and, eastern, of, earlier, periods, the, third, rome, concept, would, resonate, in, the, self, image, of, the, russian, people, in, future, centuries, the, development, of, the, tsar, s, autocratic, powers, reached, a, peak, during, the, reign, of, ivan, iv, and, he, gained, the, sobriquet, grozny, the, english, word, terrible, is, usually, used, to, translate, the, russian, word, grozny, in, ivan, s, nickname, but, this, is, a, somewhat, archaic, translation, the, russian, word, grozny, reflects, the, older, english, usage, of, terrible, as, in, inspiring, fear, or, terror, dangerous, powerful, formidable, it, does, not, convey, the, more, modern, connotations, of, english, terrible, such, as, defective, or, evil, vladimir, dal, defined, grozny, specifically, in, archaic, usage, and, as, an, epithet, for, tsars, courageous, magnificent, magisterial, and, keeping, enemies, in, fear, but, people, in, obedience, other, translations, have, also, been, suggested, by, modern, scholars, ivan, iv, became, grand, prince, of, moscow, in, 1533, at, the, age, of, three, the, shuysky, and, belsky, factions, of, the, boyars, competed, for, control, of, the, regency, until, ivan, assumed, the, throne, in, 1547, reflecting, moscow, s, new, imperial, claims, ivan, s, coronation, as, tsar, was, a, ritual, modeled, after, those, of, the, byzantine, emperors, with, the, continuing, assistance, of, a, group, of, boyars, ivan, began, his, reign, with, a, series, of, useful, reforms, in, the, 1550s, he, declared, a, new, law, code, revamped, the, military, and, reorganized, local, government, these, reforms, undoubtedly, were, intended, to, strengthen, the, state, in, the, face, of, continuous, warfare, the, key, documents, prepared, by, the, so, called, select, council, of, advisors, and, promulgated, during, this, period, are, as, follows, muscovy, remained, a, fairly, unknown, society, in, western, europe, until, baron, sigismund, von, herberstein, published, his, rerum, moscoviticarum, commentarii, literally, notes, on, muscovite, affairs, in, 1549, this, provided, a, broad, view, of, what, had, been, a, rarely, visited, and, poorly, reported, state, in, the, 1630s, the, russian, tsardom, was, visited, by, adam, olearius, whose, lively, and, well, informed, writings, were, soon, translated, into, all, the, major, languages, of, europe, further, information, about, russia, was, circulated, by, english, and, dutch, merchants, one, of, them, richard, chancellor, sailed, to, the, white, sea, in, 1553, and, continued, overland, to, moscow, upon, his, return, to, england, the, muscovy, company, was, formed, by, himself, sebastian, cabot, sir, hugh, willoughby, and, several, london, merchants, ivan, iv, used, these, merchants, to, exchange, letters, with, elizabeth, i, despite, the, domestic, turmoil, of, the, 1530s, and, 1540s, russia, continued, to, wage, wars, and, to, expand, it, grew, from, 2, 8, to, 5, 4, million, square, kilometers, from, 1533, to, 1584, ivan, defeated, and, annexed, the, khanate, of, kazan, on, the, middle, volga, in, 1552, and, later, the, astrakhan, khanate, where, the, volga, meets, the, caspian, sea, these, victories, transformed, russia, into, a, multiethnic, and, multiconfessional, state, which, it, continues, to, be, today, the, tsar, now, controlled, the, entire, volga, river, and, gained, access, to, central, asia, expanding, to, the, northwest, toward, the, baltic, sea, proved, to, be, much, more, difficult, in, 1558, ivan, invaded, livonia, eventually, involving, himself, in, a, twenty, five, year, war, against, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, sweden, and, denmark, despite, first, successes, ivan, s, army, was, pushed, back, and, the, nation, failed, to, secure, a, coveted, position, on, the, baltic, sea, hoping, to, make, profit, from, russia, s, concentration, on, livonian, affairs, devlet, i, giray, of, crimea, accompanied, by, as, many, as, 120, 000, horsemen, repeatedly, devastated, the, moscow, region, until, the, battle, of, molodi, put, a, stop, to, such, northward, incursions, but, for, decades, to, come, the, southern, borderland, was, annually, pillaged, by, the, nogai, horde, and, the, crimean, khanate, who, took, local, inhabitants, with, them, as, slaves, tens, of, thousands, of, soldiers, protected, the, great, abatis, belt, a, burden, for, a, state, whose, social, and, economic, development, was, stagnating, during, the, late, 1550s, ivan, developed, a, hostility, toward, his, advisers, the, government, and, the, boyars, historians, have, not, determined, whether, policy, differences, personal, animosities, or, mental, imbalance, caused, his, wrath, in, 1565, he, divided, russia, into, two, parts, his, private, domain, or, oprichnina, and, the, public, realm, or, zemshchina, for, his, private, domain, ivan, chose, some, of, the, most, prosperous, and, important, districts, of, russia, in, these, areas, ivan, s, agents, attacked, boyars, merchants, and, even, common, people, summarily, executing, some, and, confiscating, land, and, possessions, thus, began, a, decade, of, terror, in, russia, that, culminated, in, the, massacre, of, novgorod, 1570, as, a, result, of, the, policies, of, the, oprichnina, ivan, broke, the, economic, and, political, power, of, the, leading, boyar, families, thereby, destroying, precisely, those, persons, who, had, built, up, russia, and, were, the, most, capable, of, administering, it, trade, diminished, and, peasants, faced, with, mounting, taxes, and, threats, of, violence, began, to, leave, russia, efforts, to, curtail, the, mobility, of, the, peasants, by, tying, them, to, their, land, brought, russia, closer, to, legal, serfdom, in, 1572, ivan, finally, abandoned, the, practices, of, the, oprichnina, according, to, a, popular, theory, the, oprichnina, was, started, by, ivan, in, order, to, mobilize, resources, for, the, wars, and, to, quell, opposition, regardless, of, the, reason, ivan, s, domestic, and, foreign, policies, had, a, devastating, effect, on, russia, and, led, to, a, period, of, social, struggle, and, civil, war, the, time, of, troubles, smutnoye, vremya, 1598, 1613, ivan, iv, was, succeeded, by, his, son, feodor, who, was, uninterested, in, ruling, and, possibly, mentally, deficient, actual, power, went, to, feodor, s, brother, in, law, the, boyar, boris, godunov, who, is, credited, with, abolishing, yuri, s, day, the, only, time, of, the, year, when, serfs, were, free, to, move, from, one, landowner, to, another, perhaps, the, most, important, event, of, feodor, s, reign, was, the, proclamation, of, the, patriarchate, of, moscow, in, 1589, the, creation, of, the, patriarchate, climaxed, the, evolution, of, a, separate, and, totally, independent, russian, orthodox, church, in, 1598, feodor, died, without, an, heir, ending, the, rurik, dynasty, boris, godunov, then, convened, a, zemsky, sobor, a, national, assembly, of, boyars, church, officials, and, commoners, which, proclaimed, him, tsar, although, various, boyar, factions, refused, to, recognize, the, decision, widespread, crop, failures, caused, the, russian, famine, of, 1601, 1603, and, during, the, ensuing, discontent, a, man, emerged, who, claimed, to, be, tsarevich, demetrius, ivan, iv, s, son, who, had, died, in, 1591, this, pretender, to, the, throne, who, came, to, be, known, as, false, dmitriy, i, gained, support, in, poland, and, marched, to, moscow, gathering, followers, among, the, boyars, and, other, elements, as, he, went, historians, speculate, that, godunov, would, have, weathered, this, crisis, had, he, not, died, in, 1605, as, a, result, false, dmitriy, i, entered, moscow, and, was, crowned, tsar, that, year, following, the, murder, of, tsar, feodor, ii, godunov, s, son, subsequently, russia, entered, a, period, of, continuous, chaos, known, as, the, time, of, troubles, despite, the, tsar, s, persecution, of, the, boyars, the, townspeople, s, dissatisfaction, and, the, gradual, enserfment, of, the, peasantry, efforts, at, restricting, the, power, of, the, tsar, were, only, halfhearted, finding, no, institutional, alternative, to, the, autocracy, discontented, russians, rallied, behind, various, pretenders, to, the, throne, during, that, period, the, goal, of, political, activity, was, to, gain, influence, over, the, sitting, autocrat, or, to, place, one, s, own, candidate, on, the, throne, the, boyars, fought, among, themselves, the, lower, classes, revolted, blindly, and, foreign, armies, occupied, the, kremlin, in, moscow, prompting, many, to, accept, tsarist, autocracy, as, a, necessary, means, to, restoring, order, and, unity, in, russia, the, time, of, troubles, included, a, civil, war, in, which, a, struggle, over, the, throne, was, complicated, by, the, machinations, of, rival, boyar, factions, the, intervention, of, regional, powers, poland, and, sweden, and, intense, popular, discontent, led, by, ivan, bolotnikov, false, dmitriy, i, and, his, polish, garrison,
