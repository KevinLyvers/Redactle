paleo, indians, were, the, first, peoples, who, entered, and, subsequently, inhabited, the, americas, towards, the, end, of, the, late, pleistocene, period, the, prefix, paleo, comes, from, the, ancient, greek, adjective, romanized, palai, s, lit, old, ancient, the, term, paleo, indians, applies, specifically, to, the, lithic, period, in, the, western, hemisphere, and, is, distinct, from, the, term, paleolithic, traditional, theories, suggest, that, big, animal, hunters, crossed, the, bering, strait, from, north, asia, into, the, americas, over, a, land, bridge, beringia, this, bridge, existed, from, 45, 000, to, 12, 000, bce, 47, 000, 14, 000, bp, small, isolated, groups, of, hunter, gatherers, migrated, alongside, herds, of, large, herbivores, far, into, alaska, from, c, 16, 500, c, 13, 500, bce, c, 18, 500, c, 15, 500, bp, ice, free, corridors, developed, along, the, pacific, coast, and, valleys, of, north, america, this, allowed, land, animals, followed, by, humans, to, migrate, south, into, the, interior, of, the, continent, the, people, went, on, foot, or, used, boats, along, the, coastline, the, dates, and, routes, of, the, peopling, of, the, americas, remain, subjects, of, ongoing, debate, it, is, likely, there, were, three, waves, of, ancient, settlers, from, the, bering, sea, to, the, america, continent, stone, tools, particularly, projectile, points, and, scrapers, are, the, primary, evidence, of, the, earliest, human, activity, in, the, americas, archeologists, and, anthropologists, use, surviving, crafted, lithic, flaked, tools, to, classify, cultural, periods, scientific, evidence, links, indigenous, americans, to, eastern, siberian, populations, by, the, distribution, of, blood, types, and, genetic, composition, as, indicated, by, molecular, data, such, as, dna, there, is, evidence, for, at, least, two, separate, migrations, paleoindians, lived, alongside, and, hunted, many, now, extinct, megafauna, large, animals, with, most, large, animals, across, the, americas, becoming, extinct, towards, the, end, of, the, paleoindian, period, as, part, of, the, late, pleistocene, megafauna, extinctions, the, potential, role, of, human, hunting, in, the, extinctions, has, been, the, subject, of, much, controversy, from, 8000, to, 7000, bce, 10, 000, 9, 000, bp, the, climate, stabilized, leading, to, a, rise, in, population, and, lithic, technology, advances, resulting, in, a, more, sedentary, lifestyle, during, the, following, archaic, period, researchers, continue, to, study, and, discuss, the, specifics, of, paleo, indian, migration, to, and, throughout, the, americas, including, the, dates, and, routes, traveled, the, traditional, theory, holds, that, these, early, migrants, moved, into, beringia, between, eastern, siberia, and, present, day, alaska, 17, 000, years, ago, at, a, time, when, the, quaternary, glaciation, significantly, lowered, sea, levels, these, people, are, believed, to, have, followed, herds, of, now, extinct, pleistocene, megafauna, along, ice, free, corridors, that, stretched, between, the, laurentide, and, cordilleran, ice, sheets, an, alternative, proposed, scenario, involves, migration, either, on, foot, or, using, boats, down, the, pacific, coast, to, south, america, evidence, of, the, latter, would, have, been, submerged, by, a, sea, level, rise, of, more, than, a, hundred, meters, following, the, end, of, the, last, glacial, period, the, time, range, of, the, peopling, of, the, americas, remains, a, source, of, substantial, debate, conventional, estimates, have, it, that, humans, reached, north, america, at, some, point, between, 15, 000, and, 20, 000, years, ago, however, some, groups, of, humans, may, have, reached, south, america, as, early, as, 25, 000, years, ago, one, of, the, few, areas, of, agreement, is, the, origin, from, siberia, with, widespread, habitation, of, the, americas, during, the, end, of, the, last, glacial, period, and, more, specifically, after, the, end, of, the, last, glacial, maximum, around, 16, 000, to, 13, 000, years, before, present, sites, in, alaska, eastern, beringia, exhibit, some, of, the, earliest, evidence, of, paleo, indians, followed, by, archaeological, sites, in, northern, british, columbia, western, alberta, and, the, old, crow, flats, region, of, the, yukon, territory, the, paleo, indians, would, eventually, flourish, all, over, the, americas, these, peoples, were, spread, over, a, wide, geographical, area, thus, there, were, regional, variations, in, lifestyles, however, all, the, individual, groups, shared, a, common, style, of, stone, tool, production, making, knapping, styles, and, progress, identifiable, this, early, paleo, indian, period, s, lithic, reduction, tool, adaptations, have, been, found, across, the, americas, utilized, by, highly, mobile, bands, consisting, of, approximately, 20, to, 60, members, of, an, extended, family, food, would, have, been, plentiful, during, the, few, warm, months, of, the, year, lakes, and, rivers, were, teeming, with, many, species, of, fish, birds, and, aquatic, mammals, nuts, berries, and, edible, roots, could, be, found, in, the, forests, and, marshes, the, fall, would, have, been, a, busy, time, because, foodstuffs, would, have, to, be, stored, and, clothing, made, ready, for, the, winter, during, the, winter, coastal, fishing, groups, moved, inland, to, hunt, and, trap, fresh, food, and, furs, late, ice, age, climatic, changes, caused, plant, communities, and, animal, populations, to, change, groups, moved, and, sought, new, supplies, as, preferred, resources, were, depleted, small, bands, utilized, hunting, and, gathering, during, the, spring, and, summer, months, then, broke, into, smaller, direct, family, groups, for, the, fall, and, winter, family, groups, moved, every, 3, 6, days, possibly, traveling, up, to, 360, km, 220, mi, per, year, diets, were, often, sustaining, and, rich, in, protein, clothing, was, made, from, a, variety, of, animal, hides, that, were, also, used, for, shelter, construction, during, much, of, the, early, and, middle, paleo, indian, periods, inland, bands, are, thought, to, have, subsisted, primarily, through, hunting, now, extinct, megafauna, large, pleistocene, mammals, included, the, giant, beaver, steppe, wisent, giant, muskox, mastodon, woolly, mammoth, and, ancient, reindeer, the, clovis, culture, appearing, around, 11, 500, bce, c, 13, 500, bp, in, north, america, is, one, of, the, most, notable, paleo, indian, archaeological, cultures, it, has, been, disputed, whether, the, clovis, culture, were, specialist, big, game, hunters, or, employed, a, mixed, foraging, strategy, that, included, smaller, terrestrial, game, aquatic, animals, and, a, variety, of, flora, paleo, indian, groups, were, efficient, hunters, and, carried, a, variety, of, tools, these, included, highly, efficient, fluted, style, spear, points, as, well, as, microblades, used, for, butchering, and, hide, processing, projectile, points, and, hammerstones, made, from, many, sources, are, found, traded, or, moved, to, new, locations, stone, tools, were, traded, and, or, left, behind, from, north, dakota, and, northwest, territories, to, montana, and, wyoming, trade, routes, also, have, been, found, from, the, british, columbia, interior, to, the, coast, of, california, the, glaciers, that, covered, the, northern, half, of, the, continent, began, to, gradually, melt, exposing, new, land, for, occupation, around, 17, 500, 14, 500, years, ago, at, the, same, time, as, this, was, occurring, worldwide, extinctions, among, the, large, mammals, began, in, north, america, camelids, and, equids, eventually, died, off, the, latter, not, to, reappear, on, the, continent, until, the, spanish, reintroduced, the, horse, near, the, end, of, the, 15th, century, ce, as, the, quaternary, extinction, event, was, happening, the, late, paleo, indians, would, have, relied, more, on, other, means, of, subsistence, from, c, 10, 500, c, 9, 500, bce, c, 12, 500, c, 11, 500, bp, the, broad, spectrum, big, game, hunters, of, the, great, plains, began, to, focus, on, a, single, animal, species, the, bison, an, early, cousin, of, the, american, bison, the, earliest, known, of, these, bison, oriented, hunting, traditions, is, the, folsom, tradition, folsom, peoples, traveled, in, small, family, groups, for, most, of, the, year, returning, yearly, to, the, same, springs, and, other, favored, locations, on, higher, ground, there, they, would, camp, for, a, few, days, perhaps, erecting, a, temporary, shelter, making, and, or, repairing, some, stone, tools, or, processing, some, meat, then, moving, on, paleo, indians, were, not, numerous, and, population, densities, were, quite, low, paleo, indians, are, generally, classified, by, lithic, reduction, or, lithic, core, styles, and, by, regional, adaptations, lithic, technology, fluted, spear, points, like, other, spear, points, are, collectively, called, projectile, points, the, projectiles, are, constructed, from, chipped, stones, that, have, a, long, groove, called, a, flute, the, spear, points, would, typically, be, made, by, chipping, a, single, flake, from, each, side, of, the, point, the, point, was, then, tied, onto, a, spear, of, wood, or, bone, as, the, environment, changed, with, the, ice, age, ending, around, 17, 13, ka, bp, on, short, and, around, 25, 27, ka, bp, on, the, long, many, animals, migrated, overland, to, take, advantage, of, the, new, sources, of, food, humans, following, these, animals, such, as, bison, mammoth, and, mastodon, thus, gained, the, name, big, game, hunters, pacific, coastal, groups, of, the, period, would, have, relied, on, fishing, as, the, prime, source, of, sustenance, archaeologists, are, piecing, together, evidence, that, the, earliest, human, settlements, in, north, america, were, thousands, of, years, before, the, appearance, of, the, current, paleo, indian, time, frame, before, the, late, glacial, maximum, 20, 000, plus, years, ago, evidence, indicates, that, people, were, living, as, far, east, as, beringia, before, 30, 000, bce, 32, 000, bp, until, recently, it, was, generally, believed, that, the, first, paleo, indian, people, to, arrive, in, north, america, belonged, to, the, clovis, culture, this, archaeological, phase, was, named, after, the, city, of, clovis, new, mexico, where, in, 1936, unique, clovis, points, were, found, in, situ, at, the, site, of, blackwater, draw, where, they, were, directly, associated, with, the, bones, of, pleistocene, animals, recent, data, from, a, series, of, archaeological, sites, throughout, the, americas, suggest, that, clovis, thus, the, paleo, indians, time, range, should, be, re, examined, in, particular, sites, such, as, cooper, s, ferry, in, idaho, cactus, hill, in, virginia, meadowcroft, rockshelter, in, pennsylvania, bear, spirit, mountain, in, west, virginia, catamarca, and, salta, in, argentina, pilauco, and, monte, verde, in, chile, topper, in, south, carolina, and, quintana, roo, in, mexico, have, generated, early, dates, for, wide, ranging, paleo, indian, occupation, some, sites, significantly, predate, the, migration, time, frame, of, ice, free, corridors, thus, suggesting, that, there, were, additional, coastal, migration, routes, available, traversed, either, on, foot, and, or, in, boats, geological, evidence, suggests, the, pacific, coastal, route, was, open, for, overland, travel, before, 23, 000, years, ago, and, after, 16, 000, years, ago, in, south, america, the, site, of, monte, verde, indicates, that, its, population, was, probably, territorial, and, resided, in, their, river, basin, for, most, of, the, year, some, other, south, american, groups, on, the, other, hand, were, highly, mobile, and, hunted, big, game, animals, such, as, gomphotheres, and, giant, sloths, they, used, classic, bifacial, projectile, point, technology, such, as, fishtail, points, the, primary, examples, are, populations, associated, with, el, jobo, points, venezuela, fish, tail, or, magallanes, points, various, parts, of, the, continent, but, mainly, the, southern, half, and, paijan, points, peru, and, ecuador, at, sites, in, grasslands, savanna, plains, and, patchy, forests, the, dating, for, these, sites, ranges, from, c, 14, 000, bp, for, taima, taima, in, venezuela, to, c, 10, 000, bp, the, bi, pointed, el, jobo, projectile, points, were, mostly, distributed, in, north, western, venezuela, from, the, gulf, of, venezuela, to, the, high, mountains, and, valleys, the, population, using, them, were, hunter, gatherers, that, seemed, to, remain, within, a, certain, circumscribed, territory, el, jobo, points, were, probably, the, earliest, going, back, to, c, 14, 200, c, 12, 980, bp, and, they, were, used, for, hunting, large, mammals, in, contrast, the, fish, tail, points, dating, to, c, 11, 000, b, p, in, patagonia, had, a, much, wider, geographical, distribution, but, mostly, in, the, central, and, southern, part, of, the, continent, the, haplogroup, most, commonly, associated, with, amerindian, genetics, is, haplogroup, q, m3, y, dna, like, mtdna, differs, from, other, nuclear, chromosomes, in, that, the, majority, of, the, y, chromosome, is, unique, and, does, not, recombine, during, meiosis, this, allows, the, historical, pattern, of, mutations, to, be, easily, studied, the, pattern, indicates, indigenous, amerindians, experienced, two, very, distinctive, genetic, episodes, first, with, the, initial, peopling, of, the, americas, and, secondly, with, european, colonization, of, the, americas, the, former, is, the, determinant, factor, for, the, number, of, gene, lineages, and, founding, haplotypes, present, in, today, s, indigenous, amerindian, populations, human, settlement, of, the, americas, occurred, in, stages, from, the, bering, sea, coast, line, with, an, initial, layover, on, beringia, for, the, founding, population, the, micro, satellite, diversity, and, distributions, of, the, y, lineage, specific, to, south, america, indicates, that, certain, amerindian, populations, have, been, isolated, since, the, initial, colonization, of, the, region, the, na, den, inuit, and, indigenous, alaskan, populations, however, exhibit, haplogroup, q, y, dna, mutations, that, are, distinct, from, other, amerindians, with, various, mtdna, mutations, this, suggests, that, the, earliest, migrants, into, the, northern, extremes, of, north, america, and, greenland, derived, from, later, migrant, populations, evidence, from, full, genomic, studies, suggests, that, the, first, people, in, the, americas, diverged, from, ancient, east, asians, about, 36, 000, years, ago, and, expanded, northwards, into, siberia, where, they, encountered, and, interacted, with, a, different, paleolithic, siberian, population, known, as, ancient, north, eurasians, giving, rise, to, both, paleosiberian, peoples, and, ancient, native, americans, which, later, migrated, towards, the, beringian, region, became, isolated, from, other, populations, and, subsequently, populated, the, americas, due, to, the, evidence, that, paleoindians, hunted, now, extinct, megafauna, large, animals, and, that, following, a, period, of, overlap, most, large, animals, across, the, americas, became, extinct, as, part, of, the, late, pleistocene, megafauna, extinctions, it, has, been, argued, by, many, authors, that, hunting, by, paleoindians, was, an, important, factor, in, the, extinctions, though, this, suggestion, is, controversial, with, other, authors, placing, the, blame, on, climatic, change, in, a, 2012, survey, of, archaeologists, in, the, saa, archaeological, record, 63, of, respondents, said, that, megafauna, extinctions, were, likely, the, result, of, a, combination, of, factors, the, archaic, period, in, the, americas, saw, a, changing, environment, featuring, a, warmer, more, arid, climate, and, the, disappearance, of, the, last, megafauna, the, majority, of, population, groups, at, this, time, were, still, highly, mobile, hunter, gatherers, but, now, individual, groups, started, to, focus, on, resources, available, to, them, locally, thus, with, the, passage, of, time, there, is, a, pattern, of, increasing, regional, generalization, like, the, southwest, arctic, poverty, dalton, and, plano, traditions, these, regional, adaptations, would, become, the, norm, with, reliance, less, on, hunting, and, gathering, and, a, more, mixed, economy, of, small, game, fish, seasonally, wild, vegetables, and, harvested, plant, foods, many, groups, continued, to, hunt, big, game, but, their, hunting, traditions, became, more, varied, and, meat, procurement, methods, more, sophisticated, the, placement, of, artifacts, and, materials, within, an, archaic, burial, site, indicated, social, differentiation, based, upon, status, in, some, groups, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, portal
