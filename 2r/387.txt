searching, into, some, pages, of, siamese, ancient, history, and, beg, to, state, that, our, ancient, capital, ayuthia, before, the, year, ad, 1350, was, but, the, ruin, of, an, ancient, place, belonging, to, kambuja, now, known, as, cambodia, formerly, called, lawek, there, were, other, cities, not, far, remote, also, possessed, by, the, kambujans, archaeological, findings, have, found, evidence, of, buildings, on, the, island, of, ayutthaya, prior, to, the, 12th, century, pottery, shards, have, been, discovered, to, have, been, dated, as, early, as, the, 1270s, some, temples, to, the, east, of, ayutthaya, off, the, island, have, been, known, to, exist, before, 1351, recent, archaeological, works, reveal, pre, existing, barays, superimposed, on, by, subsequent, structures, the,

king, of, ayodhia, on, his, return, from, lanka, since, the, late, 13th, century, expeditions, were, sent, to, the, malay, peninsula, and, sumatra, in, the, goal, of, extracting, resources, to, gain, a, share, of, the, maritime, trade, other, contemporary, scholars, argued, that, ayutthaya, had, been, an, important, commercial, center, since, the, 11th, century, or, at, least, several, centuries, prior, to, 1351, the, earliest, written, records, of, ayutthaya, in, the, chinese, chronicles, is, that, a, chinese, official, fled, to, xian, in, 1282, 83, xian, first, sent, an, embassy, to, china, in, 1292, who, the, chinese, then, requested, another, embassy, soon, after, that, signifying, ayutthaya, s, early, prominence, before, ayutthaya, s, founding, while, older, and, traditional, scholars, argue, that, the, ethnically, thai, sukhothai, or, suphanburi, was, the, xi, n, mentioned, in, chinese, sources, more, recent, scholarship, like, chris, baker, and, pasuk, phongpaichit, argue, that, xian, referred, to, ayutthaya, as, that, was, the, same, name, later, used, for, ayutthaya, by, the, chinese, court, michael, vickery, argued, that, it, is, likely, the, chinese, used, xian, to, refer, to, the, lower, chao, phraya, basin, from, its, inception, in, 877, a, royal, lineage, from, bang, pan, present, day, in, phran, kratai, kamphaeng, phet, phra, maha, buddha, sakorn,

the, throne, was, then, transferred, to, another, royal, lineage, from, inthapatnakhon, phraya, khodhom, who, then, relocated, the, city, eastward, to, the, right, bank, of, pasak, river, near, the, present, wat, ayodhya, and, the, old, city, sangkaburi, was, abandoned, khodhom, ruled, the, new, city, for, 30, years, then, his, son, kothrabong, took, over, the, throne, in, 1004, later, in, 1022, kothrabong, lost, power, to, kreak, a, commoner, from, lavo, who, was, then, crowned, as, the, new, ruler, named, sinthapomarin, because, kreak, was, not, originally, considered, a, royal, lineage, after, he, died, in, 1081, the, throne, was, despoiled, by, narai, the, son, of, king, chadachota, from, lavo, kingdom, who, was, of, the, lineage, of, the, previous, sangkaburi, s, kings, narai, renamed, the, city, ayodhya, and, eventually, set, it, as, the, new, capital, of, the, lavo, kingdom, during, his, reign, the, former, capital, was, then, renamed, lopburi, after, the, end, of, narai, s, reign, in, 1147, ayodhya, fell, under, the, power, struggles, between, nine, amatyas, for, two, years, until, the, throne, was, given, to, phra, chao, luang, who, relocated, the, city, in, 1157, southward, to, the, east, bank, of, the, chao, phraya, river, near, the, mouth, of, the, mae, bea, river, south, of, the, present, wat, phanan, choeng, the, new, city, was, later, named, sena, ratchanakhon, by, his, successor, duangkrien, kritnarat, or, sai, nam, peung, who, was, appointed, the, new, ruler, by, his, father, kraisornrat, who, was, also, the, lopburi, s, king, the, city, of, ayodhya, was, abandoned, in, 1211, after, lopburi, s, king, kraisornrat, died, with, no, heir, apparent, the, king, of, phraek, siracha, present, day, sankhaburi, who, was, the, grandfather, of, ayutthaya, s, first, king, uthong, took, over, the, throne, after, he, died, in, 1319, both, lopburi, and, the, city, of, sena, ratchanakhon, was, considered, royal, inheritances, for, his, daughter, who, later, passed, it, to, her, son, uthong, ayutthaya, was, traditionally, founded, by, king, uthong, on, 4, march, 1351, this, fact, however, has, been, subject, to, long, scholarly, debate, according, to, chris, baker, pasuk, phongpaichit, there, are, at, least, seven, legends, about, who, uthong, was, a, northern, thai, prince, a, fugitive, chinese, prince, from, the, sea, a, khmer, noble, from, angkor, a, ruler, from, one, of, the, gulf, cities, or, a, chola, other, than, being, the, legendary, founder, of, ayutthaya, the, only, thing, known, about, uthong, in, the, chronicles, is, the, year, of, his, death, in, the, 1290s, through, to, the, 1490s, ayutthaya, sent, forces, down, to, the, peninsula, and, demanded, tribute, from, the, malay, principalities, all, the, way, down, to, temasek, singapura, modern, singapore, and, sumatra, the, early, ayutthaya, polity, was, a, maritime, oriented, confederation, more, in, line, with, the, malay, polities, of, maritime, southeast, asia, than, with, states, inland, like, sukhothai, and, the, northern, cities, muslim, and, european, mapmakers, labelled, the, malay, peninsula, up, to, the, tenasserim, coast, as, part, of, ayutthaya, in, the, 15th, and, early, 16th, centuries, early, ayutthaya, did, not, keep, records, and, their, early, dynastic, chronology, is, likely, fabricated, by, later, ayutthaya, elites, writing, their, past, histories, the, early, chronology, in, the, palace, chronicles, does, not, correlate, with, the, ayutthaya, temple, chronicles, nor, the, chinese, court, chronicles, the, integrity, of, the, patchwork, of, cities, of, early, ayutthaya, kingdom, was, maintained, largely, through, familial, connections, under, the, mandala, system, king, uthong, had, his, son, prince,

called, muang, look, luang, thai, each, city, ruler, swore, allegiance, and, loyalty, to, the, king, of, ayutthaya, but, also, retained, certain, privileges, politics, of, early, ayutthaya, was, characterized, by, rivalries, between, the, two, dynasties, the, uthong, dynasty, based, on, lopburi, lavo, and, the, suphannabhum, dynasty, based, on, suphanburi, traditional, narratives, argued, that, ayutthaya, conquered, sukhothai, angkor, etc, but, more, modern, narratives, argue, that, territorial, conquest, was, a, european, thing, and, not, a, southeast, asian, thing, rather, the, processes, which, saw, ayutthaya, expand, was, one, of, political, merger, and, consolidation, between, the, cities, at, the, head, of, the, peninsula, and, slowly, ascending, up, the, chao, phraya, river, basin, to, the, northern, cities, the, culture, of, early, ayutthaya, described, by, ma, huan, a, scribe, on, zheng, he, s, voyages, in, the, early, 15th, century, described, ayutthaya, as, a, rowdy, port, town, whose, men, practice, fighting, on, water, and, where, the, affairs, of, everyday, life, was, arranged, by, the, women, the, cities, on, the, peninsula, regularly, complained, to, the, chinese, court, about, constant, siamese, attacks, down, the, peninsula, around, this, time, period, the, 1430s, through, to, 1600, marked, a, period, of, rising, warfare, throughout, mainland,

did, not, sack, the, city, although, ayutthaya, did, install, a, short, lived, puppet, ruler, palace, law, codes, under, trailokkanat, exemplified, the, newfound, attention, to, warfare, citing, a, number, of, rewards, for, the, number, of, enemies, beheaded, the, introduction, of, elephants, guns, and, mercenaries, made, wars, in, southeast, asia, much, more, chronic, and, much, more, deadly,

centuries, its, absorption, of, the, northern, cities, and, the, shifting, of, trade, power, to, the, inland, trade, routes, with, china, facilitated, this, change, of, policy, the, reign, of, king, borommatrailokkanat, was, the, peak, of, this, merger, between, the, basin, and, the, northern, cities, being, the, scion, of, generations, of, intermarriage, between, the, two, even, though, trailokkanat, symbolized, the, merger, between, north, and, south, the, lan, na, kingdom, a, state, north, of, ayutthaya, modern, day, northern, thailand, contested, ayutthaya, s, growing, influence, over, the, northern, cities, the, ayutthaya, lan, na, war, was, fought, over, the, upper, chao, phraya, valley, for, control, of, the, northern, cities, whether, he, preferred, the, northern, cities, to, ayutthaya, or, the, necessity, to, have, a, capital, closer, to, the, war, trailokkanat, moved, his, capital, to, phitsanulok, lan, na, suffered, setbacks, and, trailokkanat, eventually, sued,

which, was, diplomatically, and, economically, fortified, by, the, military, support, of, ming, china, in, the, early, 15th, century, the, ming, admiral, zheng, he, established, a, base, of, operation, in, the, port, city, making, it, a, strategic, position, the, chinese, could, not, afford, to, lose, to, the, siamese, under, this, protection, malacca, flourished, becoming, one, of, ayutthaya, s, great, foes, until, the, capture, of, malacca, by, the, portuguese, ayutthaya, s, attention, to, the, portage, routes, across, the, upper, peninsula, meant, that, it, did, not, send, a, military, expedition, to, the, lower, peninsula, and, the, malay, states, throughout, the, 16th, century, ayutthaya, s, sphere, of, influence, was, now, stretched, from, the, northern, cities, to, the, malay, peninsula, with, its, heartland, centered, around, the, old, ayutthaya, suphanburi, lopburi, phetchaburi, polity, the, muang, look, luang, system, was, inadequate, to, govern, relatively, vast, territories, the, government, of, ayutthaya, was, centralized, and, institutionalized, under, king, trailokkanat, in, his, reforms, promulgating, in, palatine, law, of, 1455, which, became, the, constitution, of, ayutthaya, for, the, rest, of, its, existence, and, continued, to, be, the, constitution, of, siam, until, 1892, albeit, in, altered, forms, the, central, government, was, dominated, by, the, chatusadom, system, thai, lit, four, pillars, in, which, the, court, was, led, by, two, prime, ministers, the, samuha, nayok, the, civil, prime, minister, and, the, samuha, kalahom, the, grand, commander, of, forces, overseeing, civil, and, military, affairs, respectively, under, the, samuha, nayok, were, the, four, ministries, in, the, regions, the, king, sent, not, rulers, but, governors, to, govern, cities, the, cities, were, under, governors, who, were, from, nobility, not, rulers, with, privileges, as, it, had, previously, been, the, hierarchy, of, cities, was, established, and, cities, were, organized, into, four, levels, large, top, level, cities, held, authorities, over, secondary, or, low, level, cities, the, increased, wealth, of, ayutthaya, resulted, in, the, beginnings, of, a, chronic, succession, struggle, for, the, ayutthaya, throne, due, to, the, lack, of, stable, succession, law, from, each, succession, from, the, 16th, century, onwards, princely, governors, or, powerful, dignitaries, claiming, their, merit, gathered, their, forces, and, moved, on, the, capital, to, press, their, claims, culminating, in, several, bloody, coups, with, the, dominance, of, the, suphanburi, clan, it, now, had, to, face, the, militaristic, nobles, of, the, northern, cities, who, increasingly, came, south, for, wealth, prospects, at, an, increasingly, wealthy, and, powerful, ayutthaya, the, first, real, succession, struggles, in, ayutthaya, occurred, in, the, early, 16th, century, with, the, northern, lords, playing, a, prominent, role, under, the, reign, of, maha, chakkraphat, the, northern, lords, led, by, the, lord, of, phitsanulok, maha, thammarachathirat, became, kingmakers, in, ayutthaya, the, final, nail, for, this, transition, was, the, overthrow, of, the, suphanburi, clan, from, the, ayutthaya, throne, following, the, 1569, burmese, capture, of, ayutthaya, placing, maha, thammarachathirat, on, the, ayutthaya, throne, the, 15th, century, also, marked, a, turning, point, in, ayutthaya, s, view, of, itself, king, trailokkanat, performed, some, sort, of, coronation, the, first, in, ayutthaya, history, in, the, 1460s, prior, to, the, 15th, century, ayutthaya, s, palaces, and, temples, were, inferior, in, grandeur, to, cities, such, as, sukhothai, and, phitsanulok, by, the, early, 16th, century, ayutthaya, had, now, rivalled, its, regional, competitors, in, its, city, grandeur, building, magnificent, wats, and, palaces, for, kings, with, a, number, of, tributary, states, starting, in, the, middle, of, the, 16th, century, the, kingdom, came, under, repeated, attacks, by, the, taungoo, dynasty, of, burma, the, burmese, siamese, war, 1547, 1549, resulted, in, a, failed, burmese, siege, of, ayutthaya, a, second, siege, 1563, 1564, led, by, king, bayinnaung, forced, king, maha, chakkraphat, to, surrender, in, 1564, the, royal, family, was, taken, to, pegu, bago, with, the, king, s, second, son, mahinthrathirat, installed, as, the, vassal, king, 111, 167, 170, in, 1568, mahinthrathirat, revolted, when, his, father, managed, to, return, from, pegu, as, a, buddhist, monk, the, ensuing, third, siege, captured, ayutthaya, in, 1569, and, bayinnaung, made, maha, thammarachathirat, also, known, as, sanphet, i, his, vassal, king, instating, the, sukhothai, dynasty, 167, in, may, 1584, less, than, three, years, after, bayinnaung, s, death, uparaja, naresuan, or, sanphet, ii, the, son, of, sanphet, i, proclaimed, ayutthaya, s, independence, this, proclamation, resulted, in, repeated, invasions, of, ayutthaya, by, burma, which, the, siamese, fought, off, ultimately, finishing, in, an, elephant, duel, between, king, naresuan, and, burmese, heir, apparent, mingyi, swa, in, 1593, during, the, fourth, siege, of, ayutthaya, in, which, naresuan, famously, slew, mingyi, swa, 443, although, the, existence, of, this, battle, has, been, challenged, by, modern, scholars, such, as, sulak, sivaraksa, today, this, siamese, victory, is, observed, annually, on, 18, january, as, royal, thai, armed, forces, day, later, that, same, year, warfare, erupted, again, the, burmese, siamese, war, 1593, 1600, when, the, siamese, invaded, burma, first, occupying, the, tanintharyi, province, in, southeast, burma, in, 1593, and, later, the, cities, of, moulmein, and, martaban, in, 1594, in, 1599, the, siamese, attacked, the, city, of, pegu, but, were, ultimately, driven, out, by, burmese, rebels, who, had, assassinated, burmese, king, nanda, bayin, and, taken, power, 443, in, 1613, after, king, anaukpetlun, reunited, burma, and, took, control, the, burmese, invaded, the, siamese, held, territories, in, tanintharyi, province, and, took, tavoy, in, 1614, the, burmese, invaded, lan, na, which, at, that, time, was, a, vassal, of, ayutthaya, fighting, between, the, burmese, and, siamese, continued, until, 1618, when, a, treaty, ended, the, conflict, at, that, time, burma, had, gained, control, of, lan, na, and, while, ayutthaya, retained, control, of, southern, tanintharyi, south, of, tavoy, 127, 130, 443, the, cessation, of, warfare, around, 1600, gave, way, to, a, prolonged, period, of, peace, and, commerce, beginning, with, the, reign, of, ekathotsorot, the, portuguese, and, dutch, conquest, of, malacca, encouraged, asian, traders, to, bypass, malacca, by, crossing, the, portage, route, mid, peninsula, controlled, by, ayutthaya, this, was, a, period, of, the, great, asian, empires, ottoman, empire, safavid, empire, mughal, empire, ming, and, qing, china, and, tokugawa, japan, ayutthaya, therefore, became, the, lucrative, middleman, for, trade, between, the, global, empires, of, the, early, modern, world, kings, and, nobles, turned, to, hunting, trade, and, the, competition, for, the, throne, with, the, ending, of, warfare, this, period, of, ayutthaya, is, also, characterized, by, the, emergence, of, mercantile, absolutism, where, the, king, had, a, virtual, monopoly, on, all, incomes, into, the, kingdom, allowing, the, king, to, build, new, temples, and, palaces, sponsor, ceremonies, and, enshroud, the, monarchy, in, ritual, mysticism, the, king, had, the, power, to, appoint, governors, of, cities, in, the, inner, ayutthaya, mueang, cities, as, well, as, appoint, ministers, in, charge, of, the, government, this, however, all, made, the, target, of, the, throne, much, more, lucrative, and, rewarding, than, before, to, be, able, to, successfully, put, your, target, onto, the, throne, would, immensely, reward, its, facilitators, as, much, as, the, winner, of, the, crown, the, ability, to, appoint, a, front, palace, was, effective, in, times, of, war, but, became, a, double, edged, sword, in, regards, to, peace, foreigners, due, to, their, lack, of, connections, within, the, kingdom, often, became, prominent, officials, within, the, ayutthaya, court, during, this, period, in, 1605, naresuan, died, of, illness, while, on, campaign, against, a, burmese, spillover, conflict, in, the, shan, region, leaving, a, greatly, expanded, siamese, kingdom, to, be, ruled, by, his, younger, brother, ekathotsarot, sanphet, iii, 173, 180, ekathotsarot, s, reign, was, marked, with, stability, for, siam, and, its, sphere, of, influence, as, well, as, increased, foreign, interactions, especially, with, the, dutch, republic, portuguese, empire, and, tokugawa, shogunate, by, way, of, the, red, seal, ships, among, others, indeed, representatives, from, many, foreign, lands, began, to, fill, siam, s, civil, and, military, administration, japanese, traders, and, mercenaries, led, by, yamada, nagamasa, for, example, had, considerable, influence, with, the, king, 51, ekathotsarot, s, era, ended, with, his, death, in, 1610, 11, the, question, of, his, succession, was, complicated, by, the, alleged, suicide, of, his, eldest, legitimate, son, suthat, while, his, second, legitimate, son, si, saowaphak, was, never, legally, designated, as, an, heir, by, ekathotsarot, himself, nonetheless, si, saowaphak, succeeded, to, the, throne, against, his, late, father, s, wishes, and, led, a, short, and, ineffective, reign, in, which, he, was, kidnapped, and, held, hostage, by, japanese, merchants, and, later, murdered, 203, 206, after, this, episode, the, kingdom, was, handed, to, songtham, a, lesser, son, born, of, ekathotsarot, and, a, first, class, concubine, songtham, temporarily, restored, stability, to, ayutthaya, and, focused, inward, on, religious, construction, projects, most, notably, a, great, temple, at, wat, phra, phutthabat, in, the, sphere, of, foreign, policy, songtham, lost, suzerainty, of, lan, na, cambodia, and, tavoy, 207, 208, expelled, the, portuguese, and, expanded, siam, s, foreign, trade, ties, to, include, both, the, english, east, india, company, and, french, east, india, company, along, with, new, merchant, colonies, in, siam, representing, communities, from, all, across, asia, 53, 54, 56, additionally, songtham, maintained, the, service, of, yamada, nagamasa, whose, japanese, mercenaries, were, at, this, point, serving, as, the, king, s, own, royal, guard, as, songtham, s, life, began, to, fade, the, issue, of, succession, generated, conflict, once, again, when, both, king, songtham, s, brother, prince, sisin, and, his, son, prince, chetthathirat, found, support, for, their, claims, among, the, siamese, court, although, thai, tradition, typically, favored, brothers, over, sons, in, matters, of, inheritance, songtham, enlisted, the, help, of, his, influential, cousin, prasat, thong, to, ensure, his, son, would, inherit, the, kingdom, instead, when, songtham, died, in, 1628, prasat, thong, used, his, alliance, with, yamada, nagamasa, s, mercenaries, to, purge, everyone, who, had, supported, prince, sisin, s, claim, eventually, capturing, and, executing, sisin, as, well, 213, soon, prasat, thong, became, more, powerful, in, siam, than, the, newly, crowned, king, chetthathriat, and, through, further, intrigue, staged, a, coup, in, which, chetthathirat, was, deposed, and, executed, in, favor, of, his, even, younger, brother, athittayawong, whom, prasat, thong, intended, to, use, as, a, puppet, ruler, 215, 216, this, form, of, government, was, quickly, met, with, resistance, by, elements, within, the, thai, court, who, were, dissatisfied, with, the, idea, of, having, two, acting, heads, of, state, since, prasat, thong, already, ruled, siam, in, all, but, name, as, kalahom, he, opted, to, resolve, the, issue, by, orchestrating, the, final, dethronement, and, execution, of, the, child, king, in, 1629, thus, prasat, thong, had, completely, usurped, the, kingdom, by, double, perhaps, triple, regicide, extinguishing, the, sukhothai, dynasty, 60, years, after, its, installation, by, the, burmese, 216, many, of, king, prasat, thong, s, former, allies, abandoned, his, cause, following, his, ascension, to, the, throne, in, the, course, of, quelling, such, resistance, prasat, thong, assassinated, his, former, ally, yamada, nagamasa, in, 1630, who, now, opposed, prasat, thong, s, coup, and, promptly, banished, all, the, remaining, japanese, from, siam, while, a, community, of, japanese, exiles, were, eventually, welcomed, back, into, the, country, this, event, marks, the, end, of, the, tokugawa, shogunate, s, long, standing, formal, relationship, with, the, ayutthaya, kingdom, upon, his, death, in, 1656, king, prasat, thong, was, succeeded, first, by, his, eldest, son, chai, who, was, almost, immediately, deposed, and, executed, by, the, late, king, s, brother, si, suthammaracha, who, in, turn, was, defeated, in, single, combat, by, his, own, nephew, narai, 216, 217, narai, finally, assumed, a, stable, position, as, king, of, ayutthaya, with, the, support, of, a, mainly, foreign, court, faction, consisting, of, groups, that, had, been, marginalized, during, the, reign, of, his, father, prasat, thong, among, his, benefactors, were, notably, persian, dutch, and, japanese, mercenaries, it, should, therefore, come, as, no, surprise, that, the, era, of, king, narai, was, one, of, an, extroverted, siam, foreign, trade, brought, ayutthaya, not, only, luxury, items, but, also, new, arms, and, weapons, in, the, mid, 17th, century, during, king, narai, s, reign, ayutthaya, became, very, prosperous, in, 1662, war, between, burma, and, ayutthaya, the, burmese, siamese, war, 1662, 64, erupted, again, when, king, narai, attempted, to, take, advantage, of, unrest, in, burma, to, seize, control, of, lan, na, 220, 227, fighting, along, the, border, between, the, two, adversaries, continued, for, two, years, and, at, one, time, narai, seized, tavoy, and, martaban, ultimately, narai, and, the, siamese, ran, out, of, supplies, and, returned, home, back, within, their, border, 139, 443, 444, while, commercially, thriving, narai, s, reign, was, also, socially, tumultuous, much, of, this, can, be, attributed, to, three, way, conflict, between, the, dutch, french, and, english, trading, companies, now, operating, in, siam, at, an, unprecedented, intensity, due, to, siam, s, role, as, a, center, of, trade, fostered, by, narai, of, these, competing, foreign, influences, narai, tended, to, favor, relations, with, the, french, wary, of, the, growing, dutch, and, english, colonial, possessions, in, the, south, china, sea, 58, soon, narai, began, to, welcome, communities, of, french, jesuits, into, his, court, and, pursue, closer, relations, with, both, france, and, the, vatican, 243, 244, indeed, the, many, diplomatic, missions, conducted, by, narai, to, such, far, flung, lands, are, some, of, the, most, celebrated, accomplishments, of, his, reign, narai, as, well, leased, the, ports, of, bangkok, and, mergui, to, the, french, and, had, many, french, generals, incorporated, into, his, army, to, train, it, in, western, strategy, and, supervise, the, construction, of, european, style, forts, during, this, time, narai, abandoned, the, traditional, capital, of, ayutthaya, for, a, new, jesuit, designed, palace, in, lopburi, 250, 251, as, a, growing, catholic, presence, cemented, itself, in, siam, and, an, unprecedented, number, of, french, forts, were, erected, and, garrisoned, on, land, leased, by, narai, a, faction, of, native, siamese, courtiers, buddhist, clergy, and, other, non, catholic, and, or, non, french, elements, of, narai, s, court, began, to, resent, the, favorable, treatment, french, interests, received, under, his, reign, 63, this, hostile, attitude, was, especially, directed, at, constantine, phaulkon, a, catholic, greek, adventurer, and, proponent, of, french, influence, who, had, climbed, to, the, rank, of, narai, s, prime, minister, and, chief, advisor, of, foreign, affairs, much, of, this, turmoil, was, primarily, religious, as, the, french, jesuits, were, openly, attempting, to, convert, narai, and, the, royal, family, to, catholicism, 62, narai, was, courted, not, just, by, catholic, conversion, but, as, well, by, proselytizing, muslim, persians, chams, and, makassars, in, his, court, the, later, of, which, communities, launched, an, unsuccessful, revolt, in, 1686, to, replace, narai, with, a, muslim, puppet, king, while, members, of, the, anti, foreign, court, faction, were, primarily, concerned, with, catholic, influence, there, is, evidence, to, suggest, that, narai, was, equally, interested, in, islam, and, had, no, desire, to, fully, convert, to, either, religion, nonetheless, a, dissatisfied, faction, now, led, by, narai, s, celebrated, elephantry, commander, phetracha, had, long, planned, a, coup, to, remove, narai, when, the, king, became, seriously, ill, in, may, 1688, phetracha, and, his, accomplices, had, him, arrested, along, with, phaulkon, and, many, members, of, the, royal, family, all, of, whom, were, put, to, death, besides, narai, who, died, in, captivity, in, july, of, that, year, 271, 273, 46, 184, with, the, king, and, his, heirs, out, of, the, way, phetracha, then, usurped, the, throne, and, officially, crowned, himself, king, of, ayutthaya, on, 1, august, 184, king, phetracha, took, mergui, back, from, french, control, almost, immediately, and, began, the, pivotal, siege, of, bangkok, which, culminated, in, an, official, french, retreat, from, siam, phetracha, s, reign, however, was, not, stable, many, of, phetracha, s, provincial, governors, refused, to, recognize, his, rule, as, legitimate, and, rebellions, by, the, late, narai, s, supporters, persisted, for, many, years, 276, 277, the, most, important, change, to, siam, in, the, aftermath, of, the, revolution, was, phetracha, s, refusal, to, continue, narai, s, foreign, embassies, king, phetracha, opted, instead, to, reverse, much, of, narai, s, decisions, and, closed, thailand, to, almost, all, forms, of, european, interaction, except, with, the, dutch, 273, 276, despite, the, departure, of, most, europeans, from, ayutthaya, their, economic, presence, in, ayutthaya, was, negligible, in, comparison, to, the, ayutthaya, china, indian, ocean, trade, lieberman, later, reinforced, by, baker, and, phongpaichit, refutes, the, idea, that, siam, s, alleged, isolationism, from, global, trade, following, the, french, and, english, departure, in, 1688, led, to, ayutthaya, s, gradual, decline, leading, up, to, its, destruction, by, the, burmese, in, 1767, stating, clearly, however, the, late, 1600s, and, especially, the, early, 1700s, inaugurated, a, period, not, of, sustained, decline, but, of, chinese, assisted, economic, vitality, that, would, continue, into, the, 19th, century, instead, the, 18th, century, was, arguably, the, ayutthaya, kingdom, s, most, prosperous, particularly, due, to, trade, with, qing, china, the, growth, of, china, s, population, in, the, late, 17th, 18th, centuries, alongside, nationwide, rice, shortages, and, famines, in, southern, china, meant, that, china, was, eager, to, import, rice, from, other, nations, particularly, from, ayutthaya, during, the, late, ayutthaya, period, 1688, 1767, the, chinese, population, in, ayutthaya, possibly, tripled, in, size, to, 30, 000, from, 1680, to, 1767, the, chinese, played, a, pivotal, role, in, stimulating, ayutthaya, s, economy, in, the, last, 100, years, of, the, kingdom, s, existence, and, eventually, played, a, pivotal, role, in, siam, s, quick, recovery, from, the, burmese, invasions, of, the, 1760s, whose, post, ayutthaya, monarchs, taksin, and, rama, i, held, close, ties, through, blood, and, through, political, connections, to, this, sino, siamese, community, between, 1600, and, 1767, all, but, two, royal, successions, were, contested, in, a, mini, civil, war, in, the, capital, the, throne, became, such, a, powerful, and, lucrative, source, of, wealth, during, the, 150, years, of, prosperity, that, many, royals, harbored, ambitions, to, seize, the, throne, an, ayutthaya, noble, in, the, 18th, century, lamented, that, a, large, portion, of, court, officials, and, able, generals, were, killed, in, multiple, succession, struggles, over, the, past, 90, years, the, last, monarch, ekkathat, alongside, his, brother, uthumphon, undermined, prince, thammathibet, the, front, palace, uparaj, and, designated, heir, to, his, father, king, borommakot, by, instigating, or, exposing, his, affair, with, two, of, his, fathers, consorts, prince, thammathibet, was, executed, for, his, alleged, crimes, corruption, was, rampant, due, to, economic, prosperity,

phrai, system, in, a, variety, of, other, ways, including, entering, the, monkhood, and, fleeing, into, the, wilderness, a, new, category, for, people, now, appeared, in, the, late, ayutthaya, records, called, phrai, mangmi, or, a, rich, serf, from, 1688, onwards, the, period, was, characterized, by, the, increasing, severity, of, commoner, revolts, the, 1688, mass, commoner, revolt, against, french, catholicism, was, unprecedented, in, ayutthaya, history, prior, to, 1688, the, revolts, of, 1688, also, marked, the, beginning, of, a, kind, of, proto, nationalism, in, which, the, concept, of, a, proto, siamese, buddhist, nationality, was, formed, however, ayutthaya, kings, only, occasionally, viewed, themselves, as, the, defender, of, the, kingdom, people, and, buddhism, which, wouldn, t, be, fully, realized, until, the, thonburi, and, bangkok, regimes, in, response, to, the, traumatic, destruction, of, the, siamese, state, in, 1767, the, 150, years, of, prosperity, brought, significant, fortunes, to, the, ayutthaya, elite, the, ayutthaya, elite, created, theatre, tropes, and, held, elaborate, celebrations, funeral, ceremonies, and, were, awarded, royal, titles, all, of, which, was, previously, privilege, only, to, royalty, kings, and, nobles, now, contested, with, one, another, for, control, of, the, decreasing, pool, of, labor, repeated, ayutthaya, laws, on, improving, the, controls, of, labor, highlighted, the, increasing, failures, of, the, elite, to, control, the, people, the, turmoil, which, resulted, from, increasing, wealth, resulted, in, the, ayutthaya, nobility, turning, towards, the, reformation, of, buddhism, as, a, new, source, of, societal, order, this, was, symbolized, with, the, reign, of, king, borommakot, 1733, 1758, who, was, championed, as, a, pious, king, for, having, all, the, characteristics, of, a, virtuous, and, pious, bodhisattva, building, and, restoring, new, temples, and, dramatically, transforming, the, ayutthaya, skyline, during, his, reign, in, 1753, following, the, request, made, by, a, delegation, of, sri, lankan, monks, who, traveled, to, ayutthaya, borommakot, sent, two, siamese, monks, to, reform, theravada, buddhism, in, sri, lanka, it, will, however, take, until, the, early, rattanakosin, period, for, the, surviving, ayutthaya, nobility, under, the, future, king, rama, i, of, the, rattanakosin, kingdom, to, successfully, reform, buddhism, in, their, image, and, form, a, near, unbroken, bond, between, the, siamese, monarchy, and, buddhism, lasting, until, the, present, in, modern, thailand, in, the, period, between, 1600, and, 1759, the, scale, of, war, subsided, compared, to, the, preceding, era, of, warfare, narai, tried, and, failed, to, capture, chiang, mai, in,

military, caste, like, the, samurai, of, japan, or, the, sikh, rajputs, perhaps, due, to, ayutthaya, kings, purposely, undermining, the, creation, of, such, an, elite, group, of, warriors, that, can, significantly, influence, or, challenge, the, throne, on, the, other, hand, the, city, of, ayutthaya, relied, on, the, wet, season, monsoons, making, the, city, impenetrable, to, a, siege, for, six, months, a, year, ayutthaya, had, over, time, amassed, a, huge, stockpile, of, large, cannons, and, arms, that, amazed, the, burmese, when, they, opened, the, treasury, of, ayutthaya, in, the, sack, of, ayutthaya, in, 1767, it, however, lacked, the, men, to, arm, these, weapons, with, the, failure, of, the, ayutthaya, corvee, system, and, increased, economic, incentives, for, phrai, to, escape, due, to, greater, integration, with, the, world, s, economy, over, the, past, 150, years, of, peace, the, weakened, burmese, toungoo, dynasty, was, overthrown, by, the, mons, of, restored,

was, reduced, to, heaps, of, ruins, and, ashes, the, city, described, by, a, danish, visitor, in, 1779, to, be, a, terrible, spectacle, totally, buried, in, undergrowth, and, inhabited, by, elephants, and, tigers, was, resettled, quite, soon, after, with, former, ayutthaya, temples, being, used, for, festivals, and, celebrations, following, the, sack, according, to, one, historian, the, post, ayutthaya, monarchs, were, the, real, demolishers, of, the, former, capital, they, took, apart, most, of, the, ruins, that, survived, the, burmese, sack, for, the, construction, of, the, new, capital, at, bangkok, for, symbolic, and, practical, reasons, bangkok, was, the, successor, of, ayutthaya, in, the, eyes, of, the, new, bangkok, elite, and, therefore, had, to, transfer, its, spiritual, power, through, the, reuse, of, its, bricks, to, build, bangkok, while, the, prospect, of, future, burmese, invasions, meant, that, there, was, not, enough, time, to, build, a, capital, via, the, traditional, method, during, the, early, rattanakosin, kingdom, in, its, early, maritime, phase, ayutthaya, rulers, were, leaders, of, a, port, city, ma, huan, described, the, ruler, of, ayutthaya, in, the, 15th, century, as, a, ruler, wearing, gold, trimmed, pants, who, rides, on, an, elephant, inspecting, the, city, with, one, attendant, and, a, ruler, who, lives, in, a, modest, looking, residence, their, relationships, to, the, other, cities, were, a, first, among, equals, status, early, ayutthaya, rulers, had, to, balance, their, interests, alongside, those, of, their, city, vassal, states, as, ayutthaya, incorporated, the, northern, cities, and, adapted, their, government, functions, in, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, ayutthaya, rulers, became, more, regal, and, assumed, more, power, at, the, cost, of, their, vassal, cities, as, the, kings, became, richer, through, trade, in, the, 17th, century, they, used, their, wealth, to, express, their, power, including, the, shrouding, of, the, monarch, in, angkorian, and, brahmic, rituals, and, symbolism, the, kings, of, ayutthaya, from, the, 17th, century, onwards, were, absolute, monarchs, with, semi, religious, status, their, authority, derived, from, the, ideologies, of, hinduism, and, buddhism, as, well, as, from, natural, leadership, the, king, of, sukhothai, was, the, inspiration, of, inscription, 1, found, in, sukhothai, which, stated, that, king, ramkhamhaeng, would, hear, the, petition, of, any, subject, who, rang, the, bell, at, the, palace, gate, the, king, was, thus, considered, as, a, father, by, his, people, at, ayutthaya, however, the, paternal, aspects, of, kingship, disappeared, the, king, was, considered, the, chakkraphat, sanskrit, chakravartin, who, through, his, adherence, to, the, law, made, all, the, world, revolve, around, him, according, to, hindu, tradition, the, king, is, the, avatar, of, vishnu, destroyer, of, demons, who, was, born, to, be, the, defender, of, the, people, the, buddhist, belief, in, the, king, is, as, righteous, ruler, sanskrit, dharmaraja, who, strictly, follows, the, teaching, of, gautama, buddha, and, aims, at, the, well, being, of, his, people, the, kings, official, names, were, reflections, of, those, religions, hinduism, and, buddhism, they, were, considered, as, the, incarnation, of, various, hindu, gods, indra, shiva, or, vishnu, rama, the, coronation, ceremony, was, directed, by, brahmins, as, the, hindu, god, shiva, was, lord, of, the, universe, however, according, to, the, codes, the, king, had, the, ultimate, duty, as, protector, of, the, people, and, the, annihilator, of, evil, according, to, buddhism, the, king, was, also, believed, to, be, a, bodhisattva, one, of, the, most, important, duties, of, the, king, was, to, build, a, temple, or, a, buddha, statue, as, a, symbol, of, prosperity, and, peace, for, locals, another, aspect, of, the, kingship, was, also, the, analogy, of, the, lord, of, the, land, or, he, who, rules, the, earth, phra, chao, phaendin, according, to, the, court, etiquette, a, special, language, rachasap, sanskrit, r, j, abda, royal, language, was, used, to, communicate, with, or, about, royalty, in, ayutthaya, the, king, was, said, to, grant, control, over, land, to, his, subjects, from, nobles, to, commoners, according, to, the, sakna, or, sakdina, system, codified, by, king, borommatrailokkanat, 1448, 1488, the, sakdina, system, was, similar, to, but, not, the, same, as, feudalism, under, which, the, monarch, does, not, own, the, land, while, there, is, no, concrete, evidence, that, this, land, management, system, constituted, a, formal, palace, economy, the, french, fran, ois, timol, on, de, choisy, who, came, to, ayutthaya, in, 1685, wrote, the, king, has, absolute, power, he, is, truly, the, god, of, the, siamese, no, one, dares, to, utter, his, name, another, 17th, century, writer, the, dutchman, jan, van, vliet, remarked, that, the, king, of, siam, was, honoured, and, worshipped, by, his, subjects, second, to, god, laws, and, orders, were, issued, by, the, king, for, sometimes, the, king, himself, was, also, the, highest, judge, who, judged, and, punished, important, criminals, such, as, traitors, or, rebels, in, addition, to, the, sakdina, system, another, of, the, numerous, institutional, innovations, of, borommatrailokkanat, was, to, adopt, the, position, of, uparaja, translated, as, viceroy, or, prince, usually, held, by, the, king, s, senior, son, or, full, brother, in, an, attempt, to, regularise, the, succession, to, the, throne, a, particularly, difficult, feat, for, a, polygamous, dynasty, in, practice, there, was, inherent, conflict, between, king, and, uparaja, and, frequent, disputed, successions, however, it, is, evident, that, the, power, of, the, throne, of, ayutthaya, had, its, limits, the, hegemony, of, the, ayutthaya, king, was, always, based, on, his, charisma, based, on, his, age, and, supporters, without, supporters, bloody, coups, took, place, from, time, to, time, the, most, powerful, figures, of, the, capital, were, always, generals, or, the, minister, of, military, department, kalahom, during, the, last, century, of, ayutthaya, bloody, fighting, among, princes, and, generals, aiming, at, the, throne, plagued, the, court, with, the, exception, of, naresuan, s, succession, by, ekathotsarot, in, 1605, the, method, of, royal, succession, at, ayutthaya, throughout, the, seventeenth, century, was, battle, although, european, visitors, to, thailand, at, the, time, tried, to, discern, any, rules, in, the, siamese, order, of, succession, noting, that, in, practice, the, dead, king, s, younger, brother, often, succeeded, him, this, custom, appears, not, to, have, been, enshrined, anywhere, the, ruling, king, did, often, bestow, the, title, of, uparaja, upon, his, preferred, successor, but, in, reality, it, was, an, elimination, process, any, male, member, of, the, royal, clan, usually, the, late, king, s, brothers, and, sons, could, claim, the, throne, of, ayutthaya, for, himself, and, win, by, defeating, all, his, rivals, moreover, groupings, of, nobles, foreign, merchants, and, foreign, mercenaries, actively, rallied, behind, their, preferred, candidates, in, hopes, of, benefiting, from, each, war, s, outcome, ayutthaya, politically, followed, the, mandala, system, commonly, used, throughout, southeast, asia, kingdoms, before, the, 19th, century, in, the, 17th, century, the, ayutthaya, monarchs, were, able, to, frequently, appoint, non, natives, as, governors, of, ayutthaya, controlled, towns, and, cities, in, order, to, prevent, competition, from, its, nobility, by, the, end, of, the, ayutthaya, period, the, siamese, capital, held, strong, sway, over, the, polities, in, the, lower, chao, phraya, plain, but, had, a, gradually, looser, control, of, polities, the, further, away, from, the, capital, at, ayutthaya, the, thai, historian, sunait, chutintaranond, notes, the, view, that, ayudhya, was, a, strong, centralized, state, did, not, hold, and, that, in, ayudhya, the, hegemony, of, provincial, governors, was, never, successfully, eliminated, the, reforms, of, king, borommatrailokkanat, r, 1448, 1488, placed, the, king, of, ayutthaya, at, the, centre, of, a, highly, stratified, social, and, political, hierarchy, that, extended, throughout, the, realm, despite, a, lack, of, evidence, it, is, believed, that, in, the, ayutthaya, kingdom, the, basic, unit, of, social, organization, was, the, village, community, composed, of, extended, family, households, title, to, land, resided, with, the, headman, who, held, it, in, the, name, of, the, community, although, peasant, proprietors, enjoyed, the, use, of, land, as, long, as, they, cultivated, it, the, lords, gradually, became, courtiers, and, tributary, rulers, of, minor, cities, the, king, ultimately, came, to, be, recognized, as, the, earthly, incarnation, of, shiva, or, vishnu, and, became, the, sacred, object, of, politico, religious, cult, practices, officiated, over, by, royal, court, brahmans, part, of, the, buddhist, court, retinue, in, the, buddhist, context, the, devaraja, divine, king, was, a, bodhisattva, the, belief, in, divine, kingship, prevailed, into, the, 18th, century, although, by, that, time, its, religious, implications, had, limited, impact, with, ample, reserves, of, land, available, for, cultivation, the, realm, depended, on, the, acquisition, and, control, of, adequate, manpower, for, farm, labor, and, defense, the, dramatic, rise, of, ayutthaya, had, entailed, constant, warfare, and, as, none, of, the, parties, in, the, region, possessed, a, technological, advantage, the, outcome, of, battles, was, usually, determined, by, the, size, of, the, armies, after, each, victorious, campaign, ayutthaya, carried, a, number, of, conquered, people, back, to, its, own, territory, where, they, were, assimilated, and, added, to,

greatly, influence, the, modern, sport, of, muay, thai, the, accomplishment, and, influence, of, thai, art, and, culture, developed, during, the, ayutthaya, period, on, the, neighboring, countries, was, evident, in, the, observation, of, james, low, a, british, scholar, on, southeast, asia, during, the, early, rattanakosin, era, the, siamese, have, attained, to, a, considerable, degree, of,

major, ancient, temple, in, ayutthaya, is, considered, to, be, the, birthplace, of, krabi, krabong, ayutthaya, was, a, kingdom, rich, in, literary, production, even, after, the, sack, of, ayutthaya, in, 1767, many, literary, masterpieces, in, the, thai, language, survived, however, ayutthayan, literature, as, well, as, thai, literature, before, the, modern, era, was, dominated, by, verse, composition, i, e, poetry, whereas, prose, works, were, reserved, to, legal, matters, records, of, state, affairs, and, historical, chronicles, thus, there, are, many, works, in, the, nature, of, epic, poetry, in, the, thai, language, the, thai, poetical, tradition, was, originally, based, on, indigenous, poetical, forms, such, as, rai, khlong, kap, and, klon, some, of, these, poetical, forms, notably, khlong, have, been, shared, between, the, speakers, of, tai, languages, since, ancient, time, before, the, emergence, of, siam, through, buddhist, and, hindu, influence, a, variety, of, chanda, prosodic, meters, were, received, via, ceylon, since, the, thai, language, is, mono, syllabic, a, huge, number, of, loan, words, from, sanskrit, and, pali, are, needed, to, compose, these, classical, sanskrit, meters, according, to, b, j, terwiel, this, process, occurred, with, an, accelerated, pace, during, the, reign, of, king, borommatrailokkanat, 1448, 1488, who, reformed, siam, s, model, of, governance, by, turning, the, siamese, polity, into, an, empire, under, the, mandala, feudal, system, 307, 326, the, new, system, demanded, a, new, imperial, language, for, the, noble, class, this, literary, influence, changed, the, course, of, the, thai, or, siamese, language, setting, it, apart, from, other, tai, languages, by, increasing, the, number, of, sanskrit, and, pali, words, drastically, and, imposing, the, demand, on, the, thais, to, develop, a, writing, system, that, preserves, the, orthography, of, sanskrit, words, for, literary, purpose, by, the, 15th, century, the, thai, language, had, evolved, into, a, distinctive, medium, along, with, a, nascent, literary, identity, of, a, new, nation, it, allowed, siamese, poets, to, compose, in, different, poetical, styles, and, mood, from, playful, and, humorous, rimed, verses, to, romantic, and, elegant, klong, and, to, polished, and, imperious, chan, prosodies, modified, from, classical, sanskrit, meters, thai, poets, experimented, with, these, different, prosodic, forms, producing, innovative, hybrid, poems, such, as, lilit, thai, an, interleave, of, khlong, and, kap, or, rai, verses, or, kap, hor, klong, thai, khlong, poems, enveloped, by, kap, verses, the, thai, thus, developed, a, keen, mind, and, a, keen, ear, for, poetry, to, maximize, this, new, literary, medium, however, an, intensive, classical, education, in, pali, was, required, this, made, poetry, an, exclusive, occupation, of, the, noble, classes, however, b, j, terwiel, notes, citing, a, 17th, century, text, book, jindamanee, that, scribes, and, common, siamese, men, too, were, encouraged, to, learn, basic, pali, and, sanskrit, for, career, advancement, 322, 323, most, countries, in, southeast, asia, share, an, indianised, culture, traditionally, therefore, thai, literature, was, heavily, influenced, by, the, indian, culture, and, buddhist, hindu, ideology, since, the, time, it, first, appeared, in, the, 13th, century, thailand, s, national, epic, is, a, version, of, the, story, of, rama, pandita, as, recounted, by, gotama, buddha, in, the, dasharatha, jataka, called, the, ramakien, translated, from, pali, and, rearranged, into, siamese, verses, the, importance, of, the, ramayana, epic, in, thailand, is, due, to, the, thai, s, adoption, of, the, hindu, religio, political, ideology, of, kingship, as, embodied, by, rama, the, siamese, capital, ayutthaya, was, named, after, the, holy, city, of, ayodhya, the, city, of, rama, thai, kings, of, the, current, dynasty, from, rama, vi, forward, and,

foreigners, following, european, styles, a, number, of, versions, of, the, ramakien, epic, were, lost, in, the, destruction, of, ayutthaya, in, 1767, three, versions, currently, exist, one, of, these, was, prepared, under, the, supervision, and, partly, written, by, king, rama, i, his, son, rama, ii, rewrote, some, parts, for, khon, drama, the, main, differences, from, the, original, are, an, extended, role, for, the, monkey, god, hanuman, and, the, addition, of, a, happy, ending, many, of, popular, poems, among, the, thai, nobles, are, also, based, on, indian, stories, one, of, the, most, famous, is, anirut, kham, chan, which, is, based, on, an, ancient, indian, story, of, prince, anirudha, in, the, ayutthaya, period, folktales, also, flourished, one, of, the, most, famous, folktales, is, the, story, of, khun, chang, khun, phaen, thai, referred, to, in, thailand, simply, as, khun, phaen, which, combines, the, elements, of, romantic, comedy, and, heroic, adventures, ending, in, high, tragedy, the, epic, of, khun, chang, khun, phaen, kckp, revolves, around, khun, phaen, a, siamese, general, with, superhuman, magical, powers, who, served, the, king, of, ayutthaya, and, his, love, triangle, relationship, between, himself, khun, chang, and, a, beautiful, siamese, girl, named, wan, thong, the, composition, of, kckp, much, like, other, orally, transmitted, epics, evolved, over, time, it, originated, as, a, recitation, or, sepha, within, the, thai, oral, tradition, from, around, the, beginning, of, the, 17th, century, c, 1600, siamese, troubadours, and, minstrels, added, more, subplots, and, embellished, scenes, to, the, original, story, line, as, time, went, on, by, the, late, period, of, the, ayutthaya, kingdom, it, had, attained, the, current, shape, as, a, long, work, of, epic, poem, with, the, length, of, about, 20, 000, lines, spanning, 43, samut, thai, books, the, version, that, exists, today, was, composed, with, klon, meter, throughout, and, is, referred, to, in, thailand, as, nithan, kham, klon, thai, meaning, a, poetic, tale, the, ayutthaya, buddhist, temple, falls, into, one, of, two, broad, categories, the, stupa, style, solid, temple, and, the, prang, style, thai, the, prangs, can, also, be, found, in, various, forms, in, sukhothai, lopburi, bangkok, wat, arun, sizes, may, vary, but, usually, the, prangs, measure, between, 15, and, 40, meters, in, height, and, resemble, a, towering, corn, cob, like, structure, prangs, essentially, represent, mount, meru, in, thailand, buddha, relics, were, often, housed, in, a, vault, in, these, structures, reflecting, the, belief, that, the, buddha, is, a, most, significant, being, having, attained, enlightenment, and, having, shown, the, path, to, enlightenment, to, others, three, clothing,

rich, citizens, 3, villagers, the, thais, never, lacked, a, rich, food, supply, peasants, planted, rice, for, their, own, consumption, and, to, pay, taxes, whatever, remained, was, used, to, support, religious, institutions, from, the, 13th, to, the, 15th, centuries, however, a, transformation, took, place, in, thai, rice, cultivation, in, the, highlands, where, rainfall, had, to, be, supplemented, by, a, system, of, irrigation, to, control, water, levels, in, flooded, paddies, the, thais, sowed, the, glutinous, rice, that, is, still, the, staple, in, the, geographical, regions, of, the, north, and, northeast, but, in, the, floodplain, of, the, chao, phraya, farmers, turned, to, a, different, variety, of, rice, the, so, called, floating, rice, a, slender, non, glutinous, grain, introduced, from, bengal, that, would, grow, fast, enough, to, keep, pace, with, the, rise, of, the, water, level, in, the, lowland, fields, the, new, strain, grew, easily, and, abundantly, producing, a, surplus, that, could, be, sold, cheaply, abroad, ayutthaya, at, the, southern, extremity, of, the, floodplain, thus, became, the, hub, of, economic, activity, under, royal, patronage, corv, e, labour, dug, canals, on, which, rice, was, brought, from, the, fields, to, the, king, s, ships, for, export, to, china, in, the, process, the, chao, phraya, delta, mud, flats, between, the, sea, and, firm, land, hitherto, considered, unsuitable, for, habitation, was, reclaimed, and, cultivated, traditionally, the, king, had, a, duty, to, perform, a, religious, ceremony, to, bless, the, rice, planting, although, rice, was, abundant, in, ayutthaya, rice, exports, were, banned, from, time, to, time, when, famine, occurred, because, of, natural, calamity, or, war, rice, was, usually, bartered, for, luxury, goods, and, armaments, from, westerners, but, rice, cultivation, was, mainly, for, the, domestic, market, and, rice, export, was, evidently, unreliable, ayutthaya, officially, used, cowrie, shells, prakab, baked, clay, coins, and, pod, duang, as, currencies, pod, duang, became, the, standard, medium, of, exchange, from, the, early, 13th, century, to, the, reign, of, king, chulalongkorn, trade, with, europeans, was, lively, in, the, 17th, century, in, fact, european, merchants, traded, their, goods, mainly, modern, arms, such, as, rifles, and, cannons, for, local, products, from, the, inland, jungle, such, as, sappan, lit, bridge, woods, deerskin, and, rice, tom, pires, a, portuguese, voyager, mentioned, in, the, 16th, century, that, ayutthaya, or, odia, was, rich, in, good, merchandise, most, of, the, foreign, merchants, coming, to, ayutthaya, were, european, and, chinese, and, were, taxed, by, the, authorities, the, kingdom, had, an, abundance, of, rice, salt, dried, fish, arrack, and, vegetables, trade, with, foreigners, mainly, the, dutch, reached, its, peak, in, the, 17th, century, ayutthaya, became, a, main, destination, for, merchants, from, china, and, japan, it, was, apparent, that, foreigners, began, taking, part, in, the, kingdom, s, politics, ayutthaya, s, kings, employed, foreign, mercenaries, who, sometimes, joined, the, wars, with, the, kingdom, s, enemies, however, after, the, purge, of, the, french, in, the, late, 17th, century, the, major, traders, with, ayutthaya, were, the, chinese, the, dutch, from, the, dutch, east, indies, company, vereenigde, oost, indische, compagnie, or, voc, were, still, active, ayutthaya, s, economy, declined, rapidly, in, the, 18th, century, until, the, burmese, invasion, caused, the, total, collapse, of, ayutthaya, s, economy, in, 1767, in, 1511, immediately, after, having, conquered, malacca, the, portuguese, sent, a, diplomatic, mission, headed, by, duarte, fernandes, to, the, court, of, king, ramathibodi, ii, of, ayutthaya, having, established, amicable, relations, between, the, kingdom, of, portugal, and, the, kingdom, of, siam, they, returned, with, a, siamese, envoy, who, carried, gifts, and, letters, to, the, king, of, portugal, the, portuguese, were, the, first, europeans, to, visit, the, country, portuguese, mercenaries, would, also, play, a, major, role, in, the, invasion, of, lanna, in, 1539, by, king, chairachathirat, and, portuguese, soldiers, would, be, considered, a, respected, fighting, force, for, the, kingdom, across, its, existence, 37, five, years, after, that, initial, contact, ayutthaya, and, portugal, concluded, a, treaty, granting, the, portuguese, permission, to, trade, in, the, kingdom, a, similar, treaty, in, 1592, gave, the, dutch, a, privileged, position, in, the, rice, trade, foreigners, were, cordially, welcomed, at, the, court, of, narai, 1657, 1688, a, ruler, with, a, cosmopolitan, outlook, who, was, nonetheless, wary, of, outside, influence, important, commercial, ties, were, forged, with, japan, dutch, and, english, trading, companies, were, allowed, to, establish, factories, and, thai, diplomatic, missions, were, sent, to, paris, and, the, hague, by, maintaining, these, ties, the, thai, court, skillfully, played, off, the, dutch, against, the, english, and, the, french, avoiding, the, excessive, influence, of, a, single, power, in, 1664, however, the, dutch, used, force, to, exact, a, treaty, granting, them, extraterritorial, rights, as, well, as, freer, access, to, trade, at, the, urging, of, his, foreign, minister, the, greek, adventurer, constantine, phaulkon, narai, turned, to, france, for, assistance, french, engineers, constructed, fortifications, for, the, thais, and, built, a, new, palace, at, lopburi, for, narai, in, addition, french, missionaries, engaged, in, education, and, medicine, and, brought, the, first, printing, press, into, the, country, louis, xiv, s, personal, interest, was, aroused, by, reports, from, missionaries, suggesting, that, narai, might, be, converted, to, christianity, the, french, presence, encouraged, by, phaulkon, however, stirred, the, resentment, and, suspicions, of, the, thai, nobles, and, buddhist, clergy, when, word, spread, that, narai, was, dying, a, general, phetracha, reigned, 1688, 1693, staged, a, coup, d, tat, the, 1688, siamese, revolution, seized, the, throne, killed, the, designated, heir, a, christian, and, had, phaulkon, put, to, death, along, with, a, number, of, missionaries, he, then, expelled, the, remaining, foreigners, some, studies, said, that, ayutthaya, began, a, period, of, alienation, from, european, traders, while, welcoming, more, chinese, merchants, but, other, recent, studies, argue, that, due, to, wars, and, conflicts, in, europe, in, the, mid, 18th, century, european, merchants, reduced, their, activities, in, the, east, however, it, was, apparent, that, the, dutch, east, indies, company, or, voc, was, still, doing, business, in, ayutthaya, despite, political, difficulties, between, 1405, and, 1433, the, chinese, ming, dynasty, sponsored, a, series, of, seven, naval, expeditions, emperor, yongle, designed, them, to, establish, a, chinese, presence, impose, imperial, control, over, trade, and, impress, foreign, peoples, in, the, indian, ocean, basin, he, also, might, have, wanted, to, extend, the, tributary, system, it, is, believed, that, the, chinese, fleet, under, admiral, zheng, he, travelled, up, the, chao, phraya, river, to, ayutthaya, on, three, occasions, meanwhile, a, japanese, colony, was, established, in, ayutthaya, the, colony, was, active, in, trade, particularly, in, the, export, of, deer, hides, and, saphan, wood, to, japan, in, exchange, for, japanese, silver, and, japanese, handicrafts, swords, lacquered, boxes, high, quality, paper, from, ayutthaya, japan, was, interested, in, purchasing, chinese, silks, as, well, as, deerskins, and, ray, or, shark, skins, used, to, make, a, sort, of, shagreen, for, japanese, sword, handles, and, scabbards, the, japanese, quarters, of, ayutthaya, were, home, to, about, 1, 500, japanese, inhabitants, some, estimates, run, as, high, as, 7, 000, the, community, was, called, ban, yipun, in, thai, and, was, headed, by, a, japanese, chief, nominated, by, thai, authorities, it, seems, to, have, been, a, combination, of, traders, christian, converts, kirishitan, who, had, fled, their, home, country, to, various, southeast, asian, countries, following, the, persecutions, of, toyotomi, hideyoshi, and, tokugawa, ieyasu, and, unemployed, former, samurai, who, had, been, on, the, losing, side, at, the, battle, of, sekigahara, padre, ant, nio, francisco, cardim, recounted, having,

and, patani, the, amount, to, which, ayutthaya, texts, were, destroyed, in, the, burmese, sack, of, 1767, varies, greatly, van, vliet, s, written, records, on, siam, is, the, earliest, written, history, of, siam, and, ayutthaya, which, date, from, the, early, to, mid, 17th, century, and, likely, used, the, religious, temple, chronicles, as, his, source, the, earliest, surviving, palace, chronicle, is, the, luang, prasoet, chronicle, which, dates, from, 1681, the, histories, of, ayutthaya, was, not, regarded, as, important, until, the, age, of, commerce, and, peace, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, early, ayutthaya, did, not, write, down, its, history, the, religious, chronicles, are, also, important, to, understanding, ayutthaya, which, date, as, early, as, the, 16th, century, early, ayutthaya, did, not, write, down, its, history, a, significant, portion, of, written, evidence, must, therefore, come, from, outside, accounts, aside, from, van, vliet, a, number, of, europeans, in, the, 17th, and, early, 18th, century, wrote, surviving, accounts, of, siam, the, chinese, palace, chronicles, are, also, instrumental, in, analyzing, ayutthaya, s, history, the, ayutthaya, testimonies, are, another, important, account, of, the, ayutthaya, kingdom, based, on, the, testimonies, of, the, former, inhabitants, of, the, ayutthaya, kingdom, and, survived, by, three, different, documents, these, accounts, attests, to, the, description, of, the, city, of, ayutthaya, and, the, ayutthaya, kingdom, prior, to, and, during, its, fall, in, 1767, the, history, of, the, ayutthaya, kingdom, overall, has, been, a, neglected, period, of, historiography, in, thailand, as, well, as, abroad, characterized, by, well, researched, and, popular, histories, of, subperiods, of, ayutthaya, chris, baker, and, pasuk, phongpaichit, s, a, history, of, ayutthaya, siam, in, the, early, modern, world, published, in, 2017, was, the, first, english, academic, book, to, have, analyzed, the, full, four, hundred, years, of, the, ayutthaya, kingdom, s, existence, the, historiography, of, southeast, asia, originated, from, post, colonial, capitals, as, thailand, had, never, been, fully, colonized, it, never, had, a, european, patron, from, which, national, histories, could, be, written, about, themselves, until, the, arrival, of, the, americans, in, the, 1960s, in, the, early, rattanakosin, period, king, rama, i, compiled, all, surviving, ayutthaya, law, records, and, published, the, three, seals, law, in, 1805, early, rattanakosin, period, documents, traced, their, national, origins, to, the, founding, of, ayutthaya, in, 1351, in, the, early, 20th, century, however, thai, elites, influenced, by, western, ideas, of, european, nationalism, and, the, nation, state, used, that, framework, to, create, a, nationalist, history, of, thailand, implementing, it, in, ways, deemphasized, ayutthaya, s, importance, to, thai, history, by, portraying, the, sukhothai, kingdom, as, the, first, thai, kingdom, or, golden, age, of, thai, ness, buddhism, thai, style, democracy, free, trade, abolition, of, slavery, rattanakosin, as, the, rebirth, and, ayutthaya, as, a, period, of, decline, between, sukhothai, and, rattanakosin, this, resulted, in, ayutthaya, being, largely, forgotten, in, the, historiography, of, thailand, for, half, a, century, following, the, works, of, prince, damrong, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, nationalist, themed, histories, of, ayutthaya, pioneered, by, prince, damrong, primarily, featured, the, stories, of, kings, fighting, wars, and, the, idea, of, territorial, subjugation, of, neighboring, states, these, historical, themes, remains, influential, in, thailand, and, in, thai, popular, history, up, until, the, present, which, has, only, been, challenged, by, a, newer, generation, of, historians, and, academics, in, thailand, and, abroad, starting, in, the, 1980s, emphasizing, the, long, neglected, commercial, and, economic, aspects, which, were, important, to, ayutthaya, new, released, sources, and, translations, from, a, variety, of, historical, records, china, the, netherlands, etc, have, made, the, researching, of, ayutthaya, history, more, accessible, in, the, past, two, and, three, decades, since, the, 1970s, newer, generations, of, academics, have, come, up, and, challenged, the, old, historiography, paying, more, attention, and, publishing, works, about, the, history, of, ayutthaya, prominently, beginning, with, charnvit, kasetsiri, s, the, rise, of, ayudhya, published, in, 1977, kasetsiri, in, 1999, argues, that, ayutthaya, was, the, first, major, political, cultural, and, commercial, center, of, the, thai, the, idea, that, ayutthaya, suffered, a, decline, following, the, departure, of, europeans, in, the, late, 17th, century, was, an, idea, popularized, at, first, in, the, rattanakosin, court, in, an, attempt, to, legitimize, the, new, dynasty, over, the, ayutthaya, ban, phlu, luang, dynasty, and, more, famously, by, anthony, reid, s, book, on, the, age, of, commerce, in, recent, decades, however, more, recent, studies, such, as, by, victor, lieberman, in,
