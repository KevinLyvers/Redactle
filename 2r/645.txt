the, history, of, christianity, follows, the, christian, religion, as, it, developed, from, its, earliest, beliefs, and, practices, in, the, first, century, spread, geographically, in, the, roman, empire, and, beyond, and, became, a, global, religion, in, the, twenty, first, century, christianity, originated, with, the, ministry, of, jesus, a, jewish, teacher, and, healer, who, was, crucified, and, died, c, ad, 30, 33, in, jerusalem, in, the, roman, province, of, judea, afterwards, his, followers, a, set, of, apocalyptic, jews, proclaimed, him, risen, from, the, dead, christianity, began, as, a, jewish, sect, and, remained, so, for, centuries, in, some, locations, diverging, gradually, from, judaism, over, doctrinal, social, and, historical, differences, in, spite, of, the, persecution, of, christians, in, the, roman, empire, the, faith, spread, as, a, grassroots, movement, that, became, established, by, the, third, century, both, in, and, outside, the, empire, new, testament, texts, were, written, and, church, government, was, loosely, organized, in, its, first, centuries, though, the, biblical, canon, did, not, become, official, until, 382, constantine, the, great, was, the, first, roman, emperor, that, converted, to, christianity, in, 313, he, issued, the, edict, of, milan, expressing, tolerance, for, all, religions, he, did, not, make, christianity, the, state, religion, but, he, did, provide, crucial, support, constantine, called, the, first, of, seven, ecumenical, councils, christianity, was, both, defined, and, transformed, in, late, antiquity, in, what, is, sometimes, called, the, golden, age, of, patristic, christianity, by, the, early, middle, ages, eastern, and, western, christianity, had, already, begun, to, diverge, while, missionary, activities, spread, christianity, across, europe, monks, and, nuns, played, a, prominent, role, in, establishing, a, christendom, that, influenced, every, aspect, of, medieval, life, from, the, ninth, century, into, the, twelfth, politicization, and, christianization, went, hand, in, hand, in, developing, the, society, of, east, central, europe, slavic, countries, the, russian, world, language, literacy, and, literature, the, byzantine, empire, was, more, prosperous, than, the, western, roman, empire, and, eastern, orthodoxy, was, influential, in, eastern, europe, centuries, of, islamic, aggression, and, the, crusades, negatively, impacted, eastern, christianity, during, the, high, middle, ages, eastern, and, western, christianity, had, grown, far, enough, apart, that, differences, led, to, the, east, west, schism, of, 1054, temporary, reunion, was, not, achieved, until, the, year, before, the, fall, of, constantinople, in, 1453, the, fall, of, the, byzantine, empire, put, an, end, to, the, institutional, christian, church, as, established, under, constantine, though, it, survived, in, altered, form, various, catastrophic, circumstances, combined, with, a, growing, criticism, of, the, catholic, church, in, the, 1300, 1500s, led, to, the, protestant, reformation, and, its, related, reform, movements, reform, and, the, catholic, counter, reformation, were, followed, by, the, european, wars, of, religion, the, development, of, modern, political, concepts, of, tolerance, and, the, age, of, enlightenment, christianity, also, influenced, the, new, world, through, its, connection, to, colonialism, its, part, in, the, american, revolution, the, dissolution, of, slavery, in, the, west, and, the, long, term, impact, of, protestant, missions, in, the, twenty, first, century, traditional, christianity, has, declined, in, the, west, while, new, forms, have, developed, and, expanded, throughout, the, world, today, there, are, more, than, two, billion, christians, worldwide, and, christianity, has, become, the, world, s, largest, and, most, widespread, religion, within, the, last, century, the, centre, of, growth, has, shifted, from, west, to, east, and, from, the, north, to, the, global, south, the, first, christian, communities, began, in, judea, a, province, of, the, roman, empire, in, the, second, quarter, of, the, first, century, they, swiftly, spread, into, the, jewish, diaspora, along, the, trade, and, travel, routes, followed, by, merchants, soldiers, and, migrating, tribes, moving, from, fewer, than, 50, 000, adherents, to, over, a, million, in, the, hundred, years, between, 150, and, 250, driven, by, a, universalist, logic, christianity, has, been, from, its, beginnings, a, missionary, faith, with, global, aspirations, leading, it, to, become, a, part, of, the, history, of, a, great, many, civilizations, jewish, christianity, was, foundational, and, remained, influential, in, palestine, syria, and, asia, minor, into, the, second, and, third, centuries, judaism, and, christianity, diverged, over, disagreements, about, jewish, law, jewish, insurrections, against, rome, which, christians, did, not, support, and, the, development, of, rabbinic, judaism, by, the, pharisees, the, sect, which, had, rejected, jesus, while, he, was, alive, the, religious, social, and, political, climate, of, the, area, was, diverse, and, often, characterized, by, turmoil, romans, of, this, era, feared, civil, disorder, giving, their, highest, regard, to, peace, harmony, and, order, piety, equalled, loyalty, to, family, class, city, and, emperor, this, was, demonstrated, through, the, practices, and, rituals, of, the, old, religious, ways, christianity, was, largely, tolerated, but, some, also, saw, it, as, a, threat, to, romanness, which, produced, localized, persecution, by, mobs, and, governors, the, first, reference, to, persecution, by, a, roman, emperor, is, under, nero, probably, in, 64, ad, in, the, city, of, rome, scholars, conjecture, that, the, apostles, peter, and, paul, were, killed, then, it, is, well, documented, that, from, 250, 311, religious, sentiment, in, the, roman, empire, rose, in, 250, the, emperor, decius, made, it, a, capital, offence, to, refuse, to, make, sacrifices, to, roman, gods, resulting, in, widespread, persecution, of, christians, valerian, pursued, similar, policies, later, that, decade, the, last, and, most, severe, official, persecution, the, diocletianic, persecution, took, place, in, 303, 311, there, was, periodic, persecution, of, christians, by, persian, sassanian, authorities, and, the, term, hellene, became, equated, with, pagan, during, this, period, beginning, with, less, than, 1000, people, christianity, had, grown, to, around, one, hundred, small, household, churches, consisting, of, an, average, of, seventy, members, each, by, the, year, 100, it, achieved, critical, mass, in, the, hundred, years, between, 150, and, 250, when, it, moved, from, fewer, than, 50, 000, adherents, to, over, a, million, this, provided, enough, adopters, for, its, growth, rate, to, be, self, sustaining, in, the, first, century, christianity, spread, into, asia, minor, athens, corinth, ephesus, and, pergamum, egyptian, christianity, probably, began, in, the, first, century, in, alexandria, as, it, spread, coptic, christianity, which, survives, into, the, modern, era, developed, christianity, in, antioch, is, mentioned, in, paul, s, epistles, early, christianity, was, in, gaul, north, africa, and, the, city, of, rome, it, spread, in, its, arian, form, in, the, germanic, world, during, the, latter, part, of, the, third, century, and, probably, reached, roman, britain, by, the, third, century, at, the, latest, from, the, earliest, days, there, was, a, christian, presence, in, edessa, modern, turkey, it, developed, in, adiabene, in, the, parthian, empire, in, persia, modern, iran, it, developed, in, georgia, by, the, black, sea, in, ethiopia, india, nubia, south, arabia, soqotra, central, asia, and, china, by, the, sixth, century, there, is, evidence, of, christian, communities, in, sri, lanka, and, tibet, according, to, the, gospels, christianity, began, with, the, itinerant, preaching, and, teaching, of, a, deeply, pious, young, jewish, man, jesus, of, nazareth, virtually, all, scholars, of, antiquity, accept, that, jesus, was, a, historical, figure, his, followers, came, to, believe, jesus, was, the, son, of, god, the, christ, a, title, in, greek, for, the, hebrew, term, mashiach, messiah, meaning, the, anointed, one, jesus, was, crucified, c, ad, 30, 33, in, jerusalem, and, after, his, death, and, burial, his, disciples, proclaimed, they, had, seen, him, alive, and, raised, from, the, dead, thereafter, he, was, said, to, be, exalted, by, god, these, became, founding, doctrines, of, christianity, from, its, beginnings, the, church, has, held, baptism, and, the, celebration, of, the, eucharist, the, last, supper, as, its, two, primary, rituals, early, christianity, s, teachings, on, morality, have, been, cited, as, a, major, factor, in, its, growth, in, contrast, to, traditional, roman, social, stratification, early, christian, communities, were, highly, inclusive, being, open, to, men, and, women, rich, and, poor, slave, and, free, in, groups, formed, by, paul, the, apostle, the, role, of, women, was, greater, than, in, other, religious, movements, intellectual, egalitarianism, made, philosophy, and, ethics, available, to, ordinary, people, and, even, slaves, whom, roman, culture, deemed, incapable, of, ethical, reflection, romans, saw, sexual, morality, as, determined, by, social, and, political, status, power, and, social, reproduction, christianity, impacted, roman, sexuality, through, its, teachings, on, freewill, divorce, and, remarriage, christians, distributed, bread, to, the, hungry, nurtured, the, sick, and, showed, the, poor, great, generosity, they, redefined, family, through, their, approach, to, death, and, burial, gathering, those, not, blood, related, into, a, common, burial, space, they, used, the, same, memorials, and, expanded, the, audience, to, include, the, extended, christian, community, christians, had, no, sacrificial, cult, and, this, set, them, apart, from, judaism, and, the, pagan, world, christianity, in, its, first, 300, years, was, highly, exclusive, believing, was, the, crucial, and, defining, characteristic, that, set, a, high, boundary, that, strongly, excluded, non, believers, this, has, been, cited, as, a, crucial, factor, in, maintaining, christian, independence, in, the, syncretizing, roman, religious, culture, the, teachers, leaders, and, philosophers, of, early, christianity, wrote, about, first, century, judaizers, second, century, gnosticism, and, marcionism, on, into, the, close, of, the, eighth, century, using, the, term, heresy, to, define, theological, error, and, establish, christian, identity, the, church, as, an, institution, began, its, formation, quickly, and, with, some, flexibility, in, these, early, centuries, before, constantine, and, the, council, of, nicaea, in, 325, christian, writings, from, the, first, century, mention, bishops, or, episkopoi, as, overseers, and, presbyters, as, elders, or, priests, with, deacons, as, servants, sometimes, using, the, terms, interchangeably, gerd, theissen, puts, forth, the, view, that, institutionalization, began, very, early, when, itinerant, preaching, first, transformed, into, resident, leadership, first, century, christian, writings, in, koine, greek, including, gospels, containing, accounts, of, jesus, ministry, letters, of, paul, and, letters, attributed, to, other, early, christian, leaders, had, considerable, authority, even, in, the, formative, period, when, discussion, began, about, creating, a, biblical, canon, to, separate, books, seen, as, authoritative, from, those, that, were, not, there, were, disputes, over, whether, or, not, to, include, some, of, them, a, list, of, accepted, books, was, established, by, the, council, of, rome, in, 382, followed, by, those, of, hippo, in, 393, and, carthage, in, 397, for, christians, these, became, the, new, testament, and, the, hebrew, scriptures, became, the, old, testament, spanning, two, millennia, the, bible, has, become, one, of, the, most, influential, works, ever, written, having, contributed, to, the, formation, of, western, law, art, literature, literacy, and, education, in, late, antiquity, christianity, turned, the, existing, network, of, diverse, christian, communities, into, an, organization, that, mirrored, the, structure, of, the, roman, empire, often, referred, to, as, the, golden, age, of, patristic, christianity, christians, of, this, era, compiled, many, of, christianity, s, greatest, works, as, they, transformed, and, defined, its, art, culture, and, literature, along, with, its, theology, philosophy, and, politics, through, its, internal, and, external, relationships, constantine, the, great, became, emperor, in, the, west, declared, himself, a, christian, and, in, 313, just, two, years, after, the, close, of, diocletian, s, persecution, issued, the, edict, of, milan, expressing, tolerance, for, all, religions, the, edict, was, a, pluralist, policy, and, throughout, the, roman, empire, of, the, fourth, to, sixth, centuries, people, shifted, between, a, variety, of, religious, groups, in, a, kind, of, religious, marketplace, constantine, did, not, make, christianity, the, official, state, religion, law, literature, rituals, and, institutions, indicate, that, converting, the, empire, to, christianity, was, a, complex, long, term, slow, paced, and, uneven, process, with, no, single, moment, or, event, to, mark, when, the, roman, state, might, have, chosen, christianity, as, its, state, religion, even, so, constantine, took, important, steps, that, supported, and, protected, christianity, he, gave, bishops, judicial, power, and, established, equal, footing, for, christian, clergy, by, granting, them, the, same, immunities, polytheistic, priests, had, long, enjoyed, by, intervening, in, church, disputes, he, initiated, a, precedent, for, ecclesiastical, councils, constantine, devoted, imperial, and, public, funds, to, building, multiple, churches, endowed, his, churches, with, wealth, and, lands, and, provided, revenue, for, their, clergy, and, upkeep, by, the, late, fourth, century, there, were, churches, in, essentially, all, roman, cities, constantine, s, sponsorship, produced, an, exuberant, burst, of, christian, art, and, architecture, frescoes, mosaics, and, hieroglyphic, type, drawings, though, classicism, experienced, a, short, revival, under, julian, the, apostate, and, in, the, theodosian, renaissance, circa, 400, while, classical, and, christian, culture, coexisted, into, the, seventh, century, christian, imagery, gradually, replaced, classical, images, the, codex, the, ancestor, of, modern, books, which, replaced, rolls, by, the, sixth, century, was, consistently, used, by, christians, long, before, it, was, generally, adopted, in, the, pagan, world, the, codex, form, was, probably, used, by, christians, as, early, as, the, first, century, the, church, in, egypt, had, most, likely, invented, the, papyrus, codex, by, the, second, century, among, the, many, great, orators, and, philosophers, of, the, fourth, and, fifth, centuries, prose, was, primary, still, a, hybrid, form, of, poetry, written, in, traditional, classic, forms, with, latin, style, and, christian, concepts, began, to, emerge, the, christian, innovation, of, mixing, genr, s, demonstrated, the, synthesis, of, christianity, and, classic, culture, that, was, taking, place, in, the, broader, culture, while, new, christian, methods, of, interpreting, and, explaining, not, simply, recording, history, began, in, roman, culture, the, legal, record, on, marriage, and, family, shows, no, drive, toward, christianization, yet, christianity, did, present, a, new, voice, on, divorce, the, required, remarriage, of, widows, and, the, established, roman, sexual, double, standard, christians, continued, to, attend, and, teach, in, late, antique, schools, which, remained, philosophically, pagan, by, following, the, advice, of, basil, of, caesarea, to, take, what, was, useful, and, leave, the, rest, twenty, first, century, scholarship, is, largely, turning, away, from, the, idea, of, an, epic, conflict, between, pagans, and, christians, in, late, antiquity, still, constantine, did, write, laws, against, sacrifice, using, language, that, peter, brown, describes, as, uniformly, vehement, with, frequently, horrifying, penalties, evidencing, the, intent, of, terrorizing, the, populace, into, accepting, its, removal, sacrifice, a, central, rite, of, virtually, all, religious, groups, in, the, pre, christian, mediterranean, largely, disappeared, before, the, end, of, the, fourth, century, since, religious, identity, was, not, tied, solely, to, that, single, practice, traditional, cults, continued, to, flourish, in, some, areas, for, enough, years, that, there, is, no, date, or, even, decade, for, scholars, to, say, when, paganism, ended, christians, of, the, fourth, century, believed, constantine, s, conversion, was, evidence, the, christian, god, had, conquered, the, polytheist, gods, in, heaven, this, triumph, of, christianity, became, the, primary, christian, narrative, in, writings, of, the, late, antique, age, in, spite, of, christians, representing, only, ten, to, fifteen, percent, of, the, empire, s, population, in, 313, as, a, minority, triumph, did, not, generally, involve, an, increase, in, violence, aimed, at, the, polytheistic, majority, constantine, s, policy, toward, non, christians, was, toleration, with, limits, so, in, general, conflict, between, these, groups, was, more, rhetorical, than, actual, with, a, few, exceptions, constantine, was, vigorous, in, reclaiming, church, properties, that, had, previously, been, confiscated, by, the, government, and, he, used, reclamation, to, justify, the, destruction, of, some, greco, roman, temples, such, as, aphrodite, s, temple, in, jerusalem, there, was, no, legislation, forcing, the, conversion, of, pagans, until, the, reign, of, the, eastern, emperor, justinian, i, in, a, d, 529, significant, jewish, communities, existed, throughout, the, christian, roman, empire, jews, and, christians, were, both, religious, minorities, claiming, the, same, inheritance, competing, in, a, direct, and, sometimes, violent, clash, in, the, fourth, century, augustine, of, hippo, argued, against, the, persecution, of, the, jewish, people, and, a, relative, peace, existed, between, jews, and, christians, until, the, thirteenth, century, although, anti, semitic, violence, erupted, occasionally, attacks, on, jews, by, mobs, local, leaders, and, lower, level, clergy, were, carried, out, without, the, support, of, church, leaders, who, generally, accepted, augustine, s, teachings, sometime, before, the, fifth, century, the, theology, of, supersessionism, emerged, claiming, that, christianity, had, displaced, judaism, as, god, s, chosen, people, supersessionism, was, never, official, or, universally, held, but, replacement, theology, has, been, part, of, christian, thought, through, much, of, history, many, attribute, the, emergence, of, antisemitism, to, this, doctrine, while, others, make, a, distinction, between, supersessionism, and, modern, anti, semitism, fourth, century, christianity, was, dominated, by, its, many, conflicts, defining, and, dealing, with, heresy, and, orthodoxy, in, the, fourth, century, the, writings, of, the, church, fathers, and, the, letters, of, bishops, emerged, as, sources, of, authority, on, orthodoxy, and, identity, in, addition, to, apostolic, authority, and, they, were, often, used, to, identify, and, condemn, heretics, in, a, highly, combative, manner, while, there, had, been, earlier, disagreements, with, the, judaizers, the, first, major, heretical, disagreement, was, between, arianism, and, traditional, orthodox, trinitarianism, over, whether, jesus, divinity, and, the, father, s, divinity, are, equal, the, first, council, of, nicaea, in, modern, turkey, called, by, constantine, in, 325, and, the, first, council, of, constantinople, called, by, theodosius, i, in, 381, produced, an, affirmation, of, orthodoxy, in, the, form, of, the, nicene, creed, additional, and, ongoing, theological, controversies, led, the, armenian, assyrian, and, egyptian, churches, to, withdraw, from, nicaean, catholicism, and, instead, combine, into, what, is, today, known, as, oriental, orthodoxy, one, of, three, major, branches, of, eastern, christianity, along, with, the, church, of, the, east, in, persia, and, eastern, orthodoxy, in, byzantium, the, conversion, of, constantine, allied, a, monotheistic, religion, with, a, global, power, both, with, ambitions, of, universality, in, the, roman, empire, of, late, antiquity, the, state, was, seen, as, a, religious, institution, with, no, separation, between, secular, and, religious, monarchy, was, thought, to, be, the, only, viable, form, of, government, therefore, the, chief, duty, of, all, ancient, monarchs, was, to, gain, heavenly, favor, however, after, the, restrictions, on, christianity, were, removed, emperor, and, bishop, began, to, share, responsibility, for, maintaining, relations, with, the, divine, this, caused, a, shift, in, power, dynamics, since, who, speaks, for, god, was, a, significant, issue, in, late, antiquity, constantine, and, his, successors, attempted, to, fit, the, church, into, their, political, program, the, church, resisted, making, a, case, for, a, sphere, of, religious, authority, separate, from, state, authority, it, forms, the, first, clearly, articulated, limitation, on, the, scope, of, a, ruler, s, power, by, distinguishing, the, power, of, the, church, from, that, of, the, empire, and, arguing, for, the, priority, of, one, over, the, other, intersection, with, the, state, also, boosted, the, church, s, authority, and, wealth, and, for, the, next, 800, years, the, western, church, struggled, between, recognition, of, the, state, as, willed, by, god, and, defense, of, the, church, s, autonomy, and, spiritual, superiority, to, the, world, for, many, centuries, the, eastern, church, demonstrated, more, ability, to, work, its, way, through, power, issues, between, church, and, state, than, did, its, western, counterparts, by, proclaiming, a, unanimity, of, church, and, state, in, caesarea, monastics, developed, an, unprecedented, health, care, system, that, allowed, the, sick, to, be, cared, for, in, a, special, building, at, the, monastery, by, those, dedicated, to, their, care, this, gave, the, sick, benefits, which, destigmatized, illness, transformed, health, care, and, led, to, the, founding, of, the, first, public, hospital, by, basil, the, great, in, caesarea, in, 369, which, became, a, model, for, hospitals, thereafter, in, north, africa, during, the, reign, of, constantine, donatism, a, christian, sect, developed, they, refused, sometimes, violently, to, accept, back, into, the, church, those, catholics, who, had, recanted, their, faith, under, persecution, after, many, appeals, the, empire, responded, with, force, and, in, 408, in, his, letter, 93, augustine, defended, the, government, s, action, augustine, s, authority, on, coercion, was, undisputed, for, over, a, millennium, in, western, christianity, and, according, to, peter, brown, it, provided, the, theological, foundation, for, the, justification, of, medieval, persecution, in, late, antiquity, king, clovis, i, united, the, franks, and, converted, to, catholicism, the, conversion, of, the, irish, began, in, the, early, fifth, century, through, missionary, activity, and, without, coercion, christianity, had, become, an, established, minority, faith, in, some, parts, of, britain, in, the, second, century, anglo, saxon, forms, of, germanic, paganism, displaced, christianity, in, fifth, century, south, eastern, britain, irish, missionaries, went, to, iona, 563, and, converted, many, picts, the, gregorian, mission, in, 597, led, to, the, conversion, of, the, first, anglo, saxon, king, thelberht, around, 600, the, church, of, this, age, was, seen, by, its, supporters, as, a, universal, church, patriarchs, in, the, east, first, extended, papal, power, and, influence, beyond, rome, as, they, frequently, looked, to, the, bishop, of, rome, to, resolve, disagreements, for, them, yet, the, tendency, for, east, and, west, to, grow, apart, was, also, already, becoming, evident, the, western, church, spoke, latin, while, the, east, spoke, and, wrote, in, at, least, five, languages, theological, differences, were, becoming, pronounced, the, manner, in, which, western, and, eastern, churches, related, to, the, state, differed, in, the, roman, west, the, church, condemned, roman, culture, as, sinful, kept, itself, as, separate, as, possible, and, struggled, to, resist, state, control, this, is, in, pointed, contrast, with, eastern, christianity, which, acclaimed, harmony, with, greek, culture, and, whose, emperors, and, patriarchs, upheld, unanimity, between, church, and, state, before, byzantine, emperor, justinian, i, 527, 565, no, roman, christian, empire, existed, under, justinian, subjects, were, left, without, doubt, that, they, lived, in, a, christian, state, until, the, time, of, justinian, the, byzantine, emperors, practiced, a, policy, of, tolerance, toward, all, religions, justinian, s, religious, policies, reflected, his, conviction, that, the, unity, of, the, empire, presupposed, unity, of, faith, he, persecuted, pagans, and, religious, minorities, and, purged, the, governmental, bureaucracy, of, those, who, disagreed, with, him, he, regulated, everything, in, religion, and, in, law, even, interfering, in, papal, elections, justinian, attempted, to, regulate, the, church, s, authority, through, pentarchy, which, advocated, sharing, government, of, the, church, between, the, patriarchs, of, constantinople, alexandria, antioch, jerusalem, and, the, pope, of, rome, the, pope, opposed, this, idea, advocating, instead, for, the, papal, supremacy, of, rome, justinian, also, integrated, christian, ideals, with, roman, law, the, code, of, justinian, became, an, essential, part, of, the, corpus, juris, civilis, which, remains, the, basis, of, civil, law, in, many, modern, states, justinian, made, donations, to, the, church, established, foundations, and, watched, over, church, property, he, supported, the, rights, of, bishops, priests, and, abbots, and, monastic, life, justinian, rebuilt, the, hagia, sophia, which, cost, 20, 000, pounds, of, gold, and, byzantine, culture, blossomed, during, his, reign, there, is, no, consensus, on, the, origins, of, christianity, beyond, byzantium, in, asia, or, east, africa, though, it, is, scattered, throughout, these, areas, by, the, fourth, century, there, is, little, documentation, and, no,

process, this, became, the, educational, foundation, for, all, slavic, nations, and, influenced, the, spiritual, religious, literary, and, cultural, development, of, the, entire, region, for, generations, many, cultural, geographical, geopolitical, and, linguistic, differences, between, east, and, west, existed, for, centuries, there, were, disagreements, over, whether, the, eastern, patriarch, could, claim, a, universal, jurisdiction, in, the, east, to, match, rome, s, jurisdiction, in, the, west, there, were, differences, in, ritual, such, as, the, use, of, unleavened, bread, in, the, eucharist, and, differences, in, points, of, doctrine, such, as, the, filioque, clause, and, nestorianism, there, was, a, general, lack, of, charity, and, respect, on, both, sides, eventually, this, produced, the, east, west, schism, also, known, as, the, great, schism, of, 1054, which, separated, the, church, into, western, catholicism, and, eastern, orthodoxy, the, middle, ages, can, be, seen, as, holding, characteristics, that, led, to, modern, civilization, christian, ideals, inherited, folklore, and, secular, intellectualism, overlapped, and, competed, across, a, wide, spectrum, of, belief, medieval, society, was, also, unlike, modernity, in, that, it, was, dominated, by, the, presuppositions, of, religion, the, church, of, 1000, 1300, became, a, more, imposing, institution, with, a, more, formal, theology, the, papacy, of, this, period, can, be, characterized, by, its, focus, on, canon, law, as, popes, from, 1159, to, 1303, were, predominantly, lawyers, not, theologians, while, early, christianity, was, both, inclusive, and, exclusive, with, no, canon, law, in, its, first, five, centuries, canon, law, in, the, middle, ages, became, a, large, and, highly, complex, system, of, laws, which, largely, omitted, early, principles, of, inclusivity, and, tolerance, the, educated, leaders, of, the, church, were, advisors, and, estate, managers, for, the, church, kings, and, nobles, often, acting, as, judges, and, negotiating, treaties, the, clergy, and, the, laity, became, more, literate, more, worldly, and, more, self, assertive, and, they, did, not, always, agree, with, the, hierarchy, the, village, parish, emerged, as, one, of, the, fundamental, institutions, of, medieval, europe, the, church, of, the, middle, ages, was, involved, in,

characterized, by, tremendous, religious, devotion, reform, and, technological, advancement, christian, humanism, and, the, intellectual, revolutions, of, high, scholasticism, and, the, renaissance, of, the, 12th, century, the, abbey, of, cluny, became, the, leading, centre, of, reform, in, western, monasticism, into, the, early, twelfth, century, the, cistercian, movement, a, second, wave, of, reform, after, 1098, also, became, a, primary, force, of, technological, advancement, and, its, spread, in, medieval, europe, between, the, eleventh, and, the, thirteenth, centuries, the, church,

process, successfully, elevated, reason, reconciled, reason, and, faith, and, formed, the, first, chapter, of, modern, free, thought, the, writings, of, thomas, aquinas, contained, ideas, that, provided, the, foundation, of, much, modern, law, and, politics, renaissance, also, included, the, revival, of, the, scientific, study, of, natural, phenomena, historians, of, science, see, this, as, the, beginning, of, what, led, to, modern, science, and, the, scientific, revolution, in, the, west, a, widespread, literate, religious, culture, was, slow, to, develop, in, medieval, christianity,

in, 1078, specifically, the, dispute, was, between, the, holy, roman, emperor, henry, iv, and, pope, gregory, vii, over, who, had, the, right, to, invest, a, bishop, or, abbot, but, more, generally, it, was, over, control, of, the, church, and, its, revenues, in, this, controversy, papal, supremacy, took, a, political, turn, gregory, recorded, a, series, of, statements, asserting, that, the, church, must, be, the, higher, of, the, two, powers, of, church, and, state, and, that, the, church, must, no, longer, be, treated, as, a, servant, to, the, state, disobedience, to, the, pope, became,

to, a, ducal, revolt, that, led, to, a, civil, war, the, great, saxon, revolt, eventually, henry, received, absolution, the, conflict, of, investiture, lasted, five, decades, with, a, disputed,

produced, cultural, change, hotly, debated, by, historians, the, single, most, important, contribution, of, the, crusades, to, christian, history, was, possibly, the, invention, of, the, indulgence,

and, civil, authorities, jointly, referred, to, as, the, medieval, inquisition, this, includes, the, episcopal, inquisition, 1184, 1230, and, the, papal, inquisition, 1230s, 1240s, though, these, courts, had, no, actual, joint, leadership, or, organization, created, as, needed, they, were, not, permanent, institutions, but, were, limited, to, specific, times, and, places, the, medieval, inquisition, brought, somewhere, between, 8, 000, and, 40, 000, people, to, interrogation, and, sentence, death, sentences, were, a, relatively, rare, occurrence, the, penalty, imposed, most, often, by, medieval, inquisitorial, courts, was, an, act, of, penance, which, could, include, public, confession, between, 1478, and, 1542, the, roman, spanish, and, portuguese, inquisitions, were, created, as, permanent, state, controlled, bureaucracies, as, political, institutions, they, had, a, much, broader, reach, than, previous, inquisitions, when, the, second, crusade, was, called, after, edessa,

talmudic, judaism, being, seen, as, so, different, from, biblical, judaism, that, old, augustinian, obligations, to, leave, the, jews, alone, no, longer, applied, as, townfolk, gained, a, measure, of, political, power, around, 1300, they, became, one, of, jewry, s, greatest, enemies, charging, jews, with, blood, libel, deicide, ritual, murder, poisoning, wells, and, causing, the, plague, and,

jews, in, germany, in, search, of, supplies, loot, and, protection, money, the, york, massacre, of, 1190, also, appears, to, have, had, its, origins, in, a, conspiracy, by, local, leaders, to, liquidate, their, debts, along, with, their, creditors, in, 1283, the, archbishop, of, canterbury, spearheaded, a, petition, demanding, restitution, of, usury, and, urging, the, jewish, expulsion, in, 1290, the, medieval, catholic, church, never, advocated, the, full, expulsion, of, all, the, jews, from, christendom, nor, did, the, church, ever, repudiate, augustine, s, doctrine, of, jewish,

propagating, his, ideas, the, three, primary, traditions, to, emerge, directly, from, the, reformation, were, the, lutheran, reformed, and, the, anglican, traditions, at, the, same, time, a, collection, of, loosely, related, groups, that, included, anabaptists, spiritualists, and, evangelical, rationalists, began, the, radical, reformation, in, germany, and, switzerland, beginning, in, 1519, huldrych, zwingli, spread, these, teachings, in, switzerland, leading, to, the, swiss, reformation, the, roman, catholic, church, soon, struck, back, launching, its, own, catholic, reformation, beginning, with, pope, paul, iii, 1534, 1549, the, first, in, a, series, of, 10, reforming, popes, from, 1534, to, 1605, a, list, of, books, detrimental, to, faith, or, morals, was, established, the,

jesuits, resembling, a, military, company, in, its, hierarchy, discipline, and, obedience, their, vow, of, loyalty, to, the, pope, set, them, apart, from, other, monastic, orders, leading, them, to, be, called, the, shock, troops, of, the, papacy, jesuits, soon, became, the, church, s, chief, weapon, against, protestantism, the, council, of, trent, 1545, 1563, denied, each, protestant, claim, and, laid, the, foundation, of, roman, catholic, policies, up, to, the, twenty, first, century, monastic, reform, also, led, to, the, development, of, new, yet, orthodox, forms, of, spirituality, such, as, that, of, the, spanish, mystics, and, the, french, school, of, spirituality, the, counter, reformation, also, created, the, uniate, church, which, used, eastern, liturgy, but, recognized,

war, in, 1522, then, intensified, in, the, first, schmalkaldic, war, 1546, 1547, and, the, second, schmalkaldic, war, 1552, 1555, in, 1562, france, became, the, centre, of, religious, wars, the, involvement, of, foreign, powers, made, the, thirty, years, war, 1618, 1648, the, largest, and, most, disastrous, the, causes, of, these, wars, were, mixed, many, scholars, see, them, as, fought, to, obtain, security, and, freedom, for, differing, religious, confessions, however, most, have, interpreted, these, wars, as, struggles, for, political, independence, that, coincided, with, the, break, up, of, medieval, empires, into, the, modern, nation, states, since, the, 1400, s, those, who, became, protestants, had, steadfastly, sought, toleration, for, heresy, blasphemy, catholicism, non, christian, religions, and, even, atheism, anglicans, and, other, christian, moderates, also, wrote, and, argued, for, toleration, while, debate, on, whether, peace, required, allowing, only, one, faith, or, if, ancient, opinions, defending, leniency, should, be, revived, occupied, every, version, of, the, christian, faith, in, the, 1690s, many, humanists, were, rethinking, on, a, political, level, all, of, the, state, s, reasons, for, persecution, this, third, group, also, began, advocating, for, religious, toleration, over, the, next, two, and, a, half, centuries, many, treaties, and, political, declarations, of, tolerance, followed, until, concepts, of, freedom, of, religion, freedom, of, speech, and, freedom, of, thought, became, established, in, most, western, countries, colonialism, opened, the, door, for, christian, mission, in, many, new, regions, according, to, sheridan, gilley, catholic, christianity, became, a, global, religion, through, the, spanish, and, portuguese, colonial, empires, in, the, sixteenth, century, and, french, missionaries, in, the, seventeenth, and, eighteenth, however, christian, missionaries, and, colonial, empires, had, separate, agendas, which, were, often, in, direct, opposition, to, each, other, most, missionaries, avoided, politics, yet, they, also, generally, identified, themselves, with, the, indigenous, people, amongst, whom, they, worked, and, lived, on, the, one, hand, vocal, missionaries, challenged, colonial, oppression, and, defended, human, rights, even, opposing, their, own, governments, in, matters, of, social, justice, for, 500, years, on, the, other, hand, there, are, an, equal, number, of, examples, of, missionaries, cooperating, with, colonial, governments, until, the, 1300s, the, official, position, of, the, roman, catholic, church, was, that, witches, did, not, exist, while, historians, have, been, unable, to, pinpoint, a, single, cause, of, what, became, known, as, the, witch, frenzy, scholars, have, noted, that, without, changing, church, doctrine, a, new, but, common, stream, of, thought, developed, at, every, level, of, society, that, witches, were, both, real, and, malevolent, records, show, the, belief, in, magic, had, remained, so, widespread, among, the, rural, people, it, has, convinced, some, historians, that, christianization, had, not, been, as, successful, as, previously, supposed, the, main, pressure, to, prosecute, witches, came, from, the, common, people, and, trials, were, mostly, civil, trials, there, is, broad, agreement, that, approximately, 100, 000, people, were, prosecuted, of, which, 80, were, women, and, that, 40, 000, to, 50, 000, people, were, executed, between, 1561, and, 1670, the, era, of, absolutist, states, followed, the, breakdown, of, christian, universalism, abuses, from, political, absolutism, practiced, by, kings, who, were, supported, by, catholicism, gave, rise, to, a, virulent, anti, clerical, anti, catholic, and, anti, christian, sentiment, that, emerged, in, the, 1680s, critique, of, christianity, began, among, the, more, extreme, protestant, reformers, who, were, enraged, by, fear, tyranny, and, persecution, twenty, first, century, scholars, tend, to, see, the, relationship, between, christianity, and, the, enlightenment, as, complex, with, many, regional, and, national, variations, the, enlightenment, shifted, the, paradigm, and, after, 1750, secularization, at, every, level, of, european, society, can, be, observed, various, ground, breaking, discoveries, led, to, the, scientific, revolution, 1600, 1750, and, an, upsurge, in, skepticism, virtually, everything, in, western, culture, was, subjected, to, systematic, doubt, including, religious, beliefs, biblical, criticism, emerged, using, historicism, and, human, reason, to, make, study, of, the, bible, more, scholarly, secular, and, democratic, depending, upon, how, radical, the, individual, scholar, was, this, produced, different, and, often, conflicting, views, posing, particular, problems, for, a, literal, bible, interpretation, which, had, emerged, in, the, 1820s, the, christian, reaction, to, the, new, historicism, was, generally, more, nuanced, and, complicated, than, literalism, allowed, and, this, eventually, produced, liberalism, and, fundamentalism, in, reaction, urbanisation, and,

cultural, centre, of, christianity, shifted, to, the, new, world, the, american, revolution, and, its, aftermath, included, legal, assurances, of, religious, freedom, and, a, general, turn, to, religious, plurality, in, the, new, country, in, the, decades, following, the, american, revolution, france, also, experienced, revolution, and, by, 1794, radical, revolutionaries, attempted, to, violently, de, christianize, france, for, the, next, twenty, years, when, napoleon, came, to, power, he, acknowledged, catholicism, as, the, majority, view, and, tried, to, make, it, dependent, upon,

world, aristocracy, offered, hope, to, the, disenfranchised, and, enabled, the, middle, class, to, reap, the, economic, benefits, of, the, industrial, revolution, scholars, have, since, identified, a, positive, correlation, between, the, rise, of, protestantism, and, human, capital, formation, the, protestant, work, ethic, economic, development, and, the, development, of, the, state, system, max, weber, says, protestantism, contributed, to, the, development, of, banking, across, northern, europe, and, gave, birth, to, capitalism, religious, revival, known, as, the, first, great, awakening, swept, through, the, american, colonies, between, the, 1730s, and, the, 1770s, beginning, among, the, presbyterians, revival, quickly, spread, to, congregationalists, puritans, and, baptists, creating, american, evangelicalism, and, wesleyan, methodism, verbal, battles, over, the, movement, and, its, dramatic, style, raged, at, both, the, congregational, and, denominational, levels, this, caused, the, division, of, american, protestantism, into, political, parties, for, the, first, time, which, eventually, led, to, critical, support, for, the, american, revolution, in, places, like, connecticut, and, massachusetts, where, one, denomination, received, state, funding, churches, now, began, to, lobby, local, legislatures, to, end, that, inequity, in, 1791, the, united, states,
