years, throughout, the, middle, ages, in, europe, jews, were, subjected, to, antisemitism, based, on, christian, theology, which, blamed, them, for, killing, jesus, in, the, nineteenth, century, many,

judaism, political, antisemitism, positing, the, existence, of, a, jewish, question, and, usually, an, international, jewish, conspiracy, emerged, in, the, eighteenth, and, nineteenth, century, due, to, the, rise, of, nationalism, in, europe, and, industrialization, that, increased, economic, conflicts, between, jews, and, non, jews, some, scientists, began, to, categorize, humans, into, different, races, and, argued, that, there, was, a, life, or, death, struggle, between, them, many, racists, argued, that, jews, were, a, separate, racial, group, alien, to, europe, the, turn, of,

party, was, founded, in, the, wake, of, the, war, and, its, ideology, is, often, cited, as, the, main, factor, explaining, the, holocaust, from, the, beginning, the, nazis, not, unlike, other, nation, states, in, europe, dreamed, of, a, world, without, jews, whom, they, identified, as, the, embodiment, of, everything, that, was, wrong, with, modernity, the, nazis, defined, the, german, nation, as, a, racial, community, unbounded, by, germany, s, physical, borders, and, sought, to, purge, it, of, racially, foreign, and, socially, deficient, elements, the, nazi, party, and, its, leader, adolf, hitler, were, also, obsessed, with, reversing, germany, s, territorial, losses, and, acquiring, additional, lebensraum, living, space, in, eastern, europe, for, colonization, these, ideas, appealed, to, many, germans, the, nazis, promised, to, protect, european, civilization, from, the, soviet, threat, hitler, believed, that, jews, controlled, the, soviet, union, as, well, as, the, western,

and, sinti, homosexual, men, and, those, perceived, as, workshy, through, a, variety, of, measures, including, imprisonment, in, concentration, camps, the, nazis, forcibly, sterilized, 400, 000, people, and, subjected, others, to, forced, abortions, for, real, or, supposed, hereditary, illnesses, although, the, nazis, sought, to, control, every, aspect, of, public, and, private, life, nazi, repression, was, directed, almost, entirely, against, groups, perceived, as, outside, the, national, community, most, germans, had, little, to, fear, provided, they, did, not, oppose, the, new, regime, the, new, regime, built, popular, support, through, economic, growth, which, partly, occurred, through, state, led, measures, such, as, rearmament, the, annexations, of, austria, 1938,

alongside, thousands, of, poles, however, they, were, not, systematically, targeted, as, they, would, be, later, and, open, mass, killings, would, subside, until, june, of, 1941, during, the,

extermination, with, complete, disregard, for, the, laws, and, customs, of, war, a, quick, victory, was, expected, and, was, planned, to, be, followed, by, a, massive, demographic, engineering, project, to, remove, 31, million, people, and, replace, them, with, german, settlers, to, increase, the, speed, of, conquest, the, germans, planned, to, feed, their, army, by, looting, exporting,

percent, 3, 3, million, people, died, primarily, of, starvation, making, them, the, second, largest, group, of, victims, of, nazi, mass, killing, after, european, jews, jewish, prisoners, of, war,

nearby, small, ghettos, were, liquidated, and, their, inhabitants, shot, by, 1943, anti, partisan, operations, aimed, for, the, depopulation, of, large, areas, of, belarus, jews, and, those, unfit, for, work, were, typically, shot, on, the, spot, with, others, deported, although, most, of, those, killed, were, not, jews, anti, partisan, warfare, often, led, to, the, deaths, of, jews, the, systematic, murder, of, jews, began, in, the, soviet, union, in, 1941, during, the, invasion, many, jews, were, conscripted, into, the, red, army, out, of, 10, or, 15, million, soviet, civilians, who,

romanian, borderlands, although, german, forces, tried, to, incite, pogroms, their, role, in, causing, violence, is, controversial, romanian, soldiers, killed, tens, of, thousands, of, jews, from, odessa, by, april, 1942, prior, to, the, invasion, the, einsatzgruppen, were, reorganized, in, preparation, for, mass, killings, and, instructed, to, shoot, soviet, officials, and, jewish, state, and, party, employees, the, shootings, were, justified, on, the, basis, of, jews, supposed, central, role, in, supporting, the, communist, system, but, it, was, not, initially, envisioned, to, kill, all, soviet, jews, the, occupiers, relied, on, locals, to, identify, jews, to, be, targeted, the, first, german, mass, killings, targeted, adult, male, jews, who, had, worked, as, civil, servants, or, in, jobs, requiring, education, tens, of, thousands, were, shot, by, the, end, of, july, the, vast, majority, of, civilian, victims, were, jews, in, july, and, august, heinrich, himmler, the, leader, of, the, ss, schutzstaffel, made, several, visits, to, the, death, squads, zones, of, operation, relaying, orders, to, kill, more, jews, at, this, time, the, killers, began, to, murder, jewish, women, and, children, too, executions, peaked, at, 40, 000, a, month, in, lithuania, in, august, and, september, and, in, october, and, november, reached, their, height, in, belarus, the, executions, often, took, place, a, few, kilometers, from, a, town, victims, were, rounded, up, and, marched, to, the, execution, site, forced, to, undress, and, shot, into, previously, dug, pits, the, favored, technique, was, a, shot, in, the, back, of, the, neck, with, a, single, bullet, in, the, chaos, many, victims, were, not, killed, by, the, gunfire, but, instead, buried, alive, typically, the, pits, would, be, guarded, after, the, execution, but, sometimes, a, few, victims, managed, to, escape, afterwards, executions, were, public, spectacles, and, the, victims, property, was, looted, both, by, the, occupiers, and, local, inhabitants, around, 200, ghettos, were, established, in, the, occupied, soviet, union, with, many, existing, only, briefly, before, their, inhabitants, were, executed, a, few, large, ghettos, such, as, vilna, kovno, riga, bia, ystok, and, lw, w, lasted, into, 1943, because, they, became, centers, of, production, victims, of, mass, shootings, included, jews, deported, from, elsewhere, besides, germany, romania, killed, the, largest, number, of, jews, romania, deported, about, 154, 000, 170, 000, jews, from, bessarabia, and, bukovina, to, ghettos, in, transnistria, from, 1941, to, 1943, jews, from, transnistria, were, also, imprisoned, in, these, ghettos, where, the, total, death, toll, may, have, reached, 160, 000, hungary, expelled, thousands, of, carpathian, ruthenian, and, foreign, jews, in, 1941, who, were, shortly, thereafter, shot, in, ukraine, at, the, beginning, of, september, all, german, jews, were, required, to, wear, a, yellow, star, and, in, october, hitler, decided, to, deport, them, to, the, east, and, ban, emigration, between, mid, october, and, the, end, of, 1941, 42, 000, jews, from, germany, and, its, annexed, territories, and, 5, 000, romani, people, from, austria, were, deported, to, d, kovno, riga, and, minsk, in, late, november, 5, 000, german, jews, were, shot, outside, of, kovno, and, another, 1, 000, near, riga, but, himmler, ordered, an, end, to, such, massacres, and, some, in, the, senior, nazi, leadership, voiced, doubts, about, killing, german, jews, executions, of, german, jews, in, the, baltics, resumed, in, early, 1942, after, the, expansion, of, killings, to, target, the, entire, soviet, jewish, population, the, 3, 000, men, of, the, einsatzgruppen, proved, insufficient, and, himmler, mobilized, 21, battalions, of, order, police, to, assist, them, in, addition, wehrmacht, soldiers, waffen, ss, brigades, and, local, auxiliaries, shot, many, jews, by, the, end, of, 1941, more, than, 80, percent, of, the, jews, in, central, ukraine, eastern, belarus, russia, latvia, and, lithuania, had, been, shot, but, less, than, 25, percent, of, those, living, farther, west, where, 900, 000, remained, alive, by, the, end, of, the, war, around, 1, 5, to, 2, million, jews, were, shot, and, as, many, as, 225, 000, roma, the, murderers, found, the, executions, distressing, and, logistically, inconvenient, which, influenced, the, decision, to, switch, to, other, methods, of, killing, most, historians, agree, that, hitler, issued, an, explicit, order, to, kill, all, jews, across, europe, but, there, is, disagreement, when, some, historians, cite, inflammatory, statements, by, hitler, and, other, nazi, leaders, as, well, as, the, concurrent, mass, shootings, of, serbian, jews, plans, for, extermination, camps, in, poland, and, the, beginning, of, the, deportation, of, german, jews, as, indicative, of, the, final, decision, having, been, made, before, december, 1941, others, argue, that, these, policies, were, initiatives, by, local, leaders, and, that, the, final, decision, was, made, later, on, 5, december, 1941, the, soviet, union, launched, its, first, major, counteroffensive, on, 11, december, hitler, declared, war, on, the, united, states, after, japan, attacked, pearl, harbor, the, next, day, he, told, leading, nazi, party, officials, referring, to, his, 1939, prophecy, the, world, war, is, here, the, annihilation, of, the, jews, must, be, the, necessary, consequence, it, took, the, nazis, several, months, after, this, to, organize, a, continent,

coordinate, anti, jewish, policy, the, majority, of, holocaust, killings, were, carried, out, in, 1942, with, it, being, the, peak, of, the, genocide, as, over, 3, million, jews, were, murdered, with, 20, or, 25, percent, of, holocaust, victims, dying, before, early, 1942, and, the, same, number, surviving, by, the, end, of, the, year, gas, vans, developed, from, those, used, to, kill, mental,

murder, of, jews, in, the, general, governorate, in, late, 1941, in, east, upper, silesia, jews, in, forced, labor, camps, operated, by, the, schmelt, organization, deemed, unfit, for, work, began, to, be, sent, in, groups, to, auschwitz, where, they, were, murdered, in, early, 1942, zyklon, b, became, the, preferred, killing, method, in, extermination, camps, after, gassing, experiments, were, conducted, on, russian, pows, in, late, august, 1941, the, camps, were, located, on, rail, lines, to, make, it, easier, to, transport, jews, to, their, deaths, but, in, remote, places, to, avoid, notice, the, stench, caused, by, mass, killing, operations, was, noticeable, to, anyone, nearby, except, in, the, deportations, from, western, and, central, europe, people, were, typically, deported, to, the, camps, in, overcrowded, cattle, cars, as, many, as, 150, people, were, forced, into, a, single, boxcar, many, died, en, route, partly, because, of, the, low, priority, accorded, to, these, transports, shortage, of, rail, transport, sometimes, led, to, postponement, or, cancellation, of, deportations, upon, arrival, the, victims, were, robbed, of, their, remaining, possessions, forced, to, undress, had, their, hair, cut, and, were, chased, into, the, gas, chamber, death, from, the, gas, was, agonizing, and, could, take, as, long, as, 30, minutes, the, gas, chambers, were, primitive, and, sometimes, malfunctioned, some, prisoners, were, shot, because, the, gas, chambers, were, not, functioning, at, other, extermination, camps, nearly, everyone, on, a, transport, was, killed, on, arrival, but, at, auschwitz, around, 20, 25, percent, were, separated, out, for, labor, although, many, of, these, prisoners, died, later, on, through, starvation, mass, shooting, torture, and,

the, holocaust, died, by, poison, gas, thousands, of, romani, people, were, also, murdered, in, the, extermination, camps, prisoner, uprisings, at, treblinka, and, sobibor, meant, that, these, camps, were, shut, down, earlier, than, envisioned, plans, to, kill, most, of, the, jews, in, the, general, governorate, were, affected, by, various, goals, of, the, ss, military, and, civil, administration, to, reduce, the, amount, of, food, consumed, by, jews, enable, a, slight, increase, in, rations, to, non, jewish, poles, and, combat, the, black, market, in, march, 1942, killings, began, in, belzec, targeting, jews, from, lublin, who, were, not, capable, of, work, this, action, reportedly, reduced, the, black, market, and, was, deemed, a, success, to, be, replicated, elsewhere, by, mid, 1942, nazi, leaders, decided, to, allow, only, 300, 000, jews, to, survive, in, the, general, governorate, by, the, end, of, the, year, for, forced, labor, for, the, most, part, only, those, working, in, armaments, production, were, spared, the, majority, of, ghettos, were, liquidated, in, mass, executions, nearby, especially, if, they, were, not, near, a, train, station, larger, ghettos, were, more, commonly, liquidated, during, multiple, deportations, to, extermination, camps, during, this, campaign, 1, 5, million, polish, jews, were, murdered, in, the, largest, killing, operation, of, the, holocaust, in, order, to, reduce, resistance, the, ghetto, would, be, raided, without, warning, usually, in, the, early, morning, and, the, extent, of, the, operation, would, be, concealed, as, long, as, possible, trawniki, men, would, cordon, off, the, ghetto, while, the, order, police, and, security, police, carried, out, the, action, in, addition, to, local, non, jewish, collaborators, the, jewish, councils, and, jewish, ghetto, police, were, often, ordered, to, assist, with, liquidation, actions, although, these, jews, were, in, most, cases, murdered, later, chaotic, capriciously, executed, selections, determined, who, would, be, loaded, onto, the, trains, many, jews, were, shot, during, the, action, often, leaving, ghettos, strewn, with, corpses, jewish, forced, laborers, had, to, clean, it, up, and, collect, any, valuables, from, the, victims, the, warsaw, ghetto, was, cleared, between, 22, july, and, 12, september, of, the, original, population, of, 350, 000, jews, 250, 000, were, killed, at, treblinka, 11, 000, were, deported, to, labor, camps, 10, 000, were, shot, in, the, ghetto, 35, 000, were, allowed, to, remain, in, the, ghetto, after, a, final, selection, and, around, 20, 000, or, 25, 000, managed, to, hide, in, the, ghetto, misdirection, efforts, convinced, many, jews, that, they, could, avoid, deportation, until, it, was, too, late, during, a, six, week, period, beginning, in, august, 300, 000, jews, from, the, radom, district, were, sent, to, treblinka, at, the, same, time, as, the, mass, killing, of, jews, in, the, general, governorate, jews, who, were, in, ghettos, to, the, west, and, east, were, targeted, tens, of, thousands, of, jews, were, deported, from, ghettos, in, the, warthegau, and, east, upper, silesia, to, che, mno, and, auschwitz, 300, 000, jews, largely, skilled, laborers, were, shot, in, volhynia, podolia, and, southwestern, belarus, deportations, and, mass, executions, in, the, bialystok, district, and, galicia, killed, many, jews, although, there, was, practically, no, resistance, in, the, general, governorate, in, 1942, some, soviet, jews, improvised, weapons, attacked, those, attempting, to, liquidate, the, ghetto, and, set, it, on, fire, these, ghetto, uprisings, were, only, undertaken, when, the, inhabitants, began, to, believe, that, their, death, was, certain, in, 1943, larger, uprisings, in, warsaw, bia, ystok, and, glubokoje, necessitated, the, use, of, heavy, weapons, the, uprising, in, warsaw, prompted, the, nazi, leadership, to, liquidate, additional, ghettos, and, labor, camps, in, german, occupied, poland, with, their, inhabitants, massacred, such, as, the, wola, massacre, or, deported, to, extermination, camps, for, fear, of, additional, jewish, resistance, developing, nevertheless, in, early, 1944, more, than, 70, 000, jews, were, performing, forced, labor, in, the, general, governorate, unlike, the, killing, areas, in, the, east, the, deportation, from, elsewhere, in, europe, was, centrally, organized, from, berlin, although, it, depended, on, the, outcome, of, negotiations, with, allied, governments, and, popular, responses, to, deportation, beginning, in, late, 1941, local, administrators, responded, to, the, deportation, of, jews, to, their, area, by, massacring, local, jews, in, order, to, free, up, space, in, ghettos, for, the, deportees, if, the, deported, jews, did, not, die, of, harsh, conditions, they, were, killed, later, in, extermination, camps, jews, deported, to, auschwitz, were, initially, entered, into, the, camp, the, practice, of, conducting, selections, and, murdering, many, prisoners, upon, arrival, began, in, july, 1942, in, may, and, june, german, and, slovak, jews, deported, to, lublin, began, to, be, sent, directly, to, extermination, camps, in, western, europe, almost, all, jewish, deaths, occurred, after, deportation, the, occupiers, often, relied, on, local, policemen, to, arrest, jews, limiting, the, number, who, were, deported, in, 1942, nearly, 100, 000, jews, were, deported, from, belgium, france, and, the, netherlands, only, 25, percent, of, the, jews, in, france, were, killed, most, of, them, were, either, non, citizens, or, recent, immigrants, si, kaddour, benghabrit, and, abdelkader, mesli, saved, hundreds, of, jews, by, hiding, them, in, the, basements, of, the, grand, mosque, of, paris, and, other, resistance, efforts, in, france, the, death, rate, in, the, netherlands, was, higher, than, neighboring, countries, which, scholars, have, attributed, to, difficulty, in, hiding, or, increased, collaboration, of, the, dutch, police, the, german, government, sought, the, deportation, of, jews, from, allied, countries, the, first, to, hand, over, its, jewish, population, was, slovakia, which, arrested, and, deported, about, 58, 000, jews, to, poland, from, march, to, october, 1942, the, independent, state, of, croatia, had, already, shot, or, killed, in, concentration, camps, the, majority, of, its, jewish, population, along, with, a, larger, number, of, serbs, and, later, deported, several, thousand, jews, in, 1942, and, 1943, bulgaria, deported, 11, 000, jews, from, bulgarian, occupied, greece, and, yugoslavia, who, were, murdered, at, treblinka, but, declined, to, allow, the, deportation, of, jews, from, its, prewar, territory, romania, and, hungary, did, not, send, any, jews, which, were, the, largest, surviving, populations, after, 1942, prior, to, the, german, occupation, of, italy, in, september, 1943, there, were, no, serious, attempt, to, deport, italian, jews, and, italy, refused, to, allow, the, deportation, of, jews, in, many, italian, occupied, areas, nazi, germany, did, not, attempt, the, destruction, of, the, finnish, jews, and, the, north, african, jews, living, under, french, or, italian, rule, an, estimated, 200, 000, to, 250, 000, germans, were, directly, involved, in, killing, jews, and, if, one, includes, all, those, involved, in, the, organization, of, extermination, the, number, rises, to, 500, 000, genocide, required, the, active, and, tacit, consent, of, millions, of, germans, and, non, germans, the, motivation, of, holocaust, perpetrators, varied, and, has, led, to, historiographical, debate, studies, of, the, ss, officials, who, organized, the, holocaust, have, found, that, most, had, strong, ideological, commitment, to, nazism, in, addition, to, ideological, factors, many, perpetrators, were, motivated, by, the, prospect, of, material, gain, and, social, advancement, german, ss, police, and, regular, army, units, rarely, had, trouble, finding, enough, men, to, shoot, jewish, civilians, even, though, punishment, for, refusal, was, absent, or, light, non, german, perpetrators, and, collaborators, included, dutch, french, and, polish, policemen, romanian, soldiers, foreign, ss, and, police, auxiliaries, ukrainian, insurgent, army, partisans, and, some, civilians, some, were, coerced, into, committing, violence, against, jews, but, others, killed, for, entertainment, material, rewards, the, possibility, of, better, treatment, from, the, occupiers, or, ideological, motivations, such, as, nationalism, and, anti, communism, according, to, historian, christian, gerlach, non, germans, not, under, german, command, caused, 5, to, 6, percent, of, the, jewish, deaths, and, their, involvement, was, crucial, in, other, ways, millions, of, germans, and, others, benefited, from, the, genocide, corruption, was, rampant, in, the, ss, despite, the, proceeds, of, the, holocaust, being, designated, as, state, property, different, german, state, agencies, vied, to, receive, property, stolen, from, jews, murdered, at, the, death, camps, many, workers, were, able, to, obtain, better, jobs, vacated, by, murdered, jews, businessmen, benefitted, from, eliminating, their, jewish, competitors, or, taking, over, jewish, owned, businesses, others, took, over, housing, and, possessions, that, had, belonged, to, jews, some, poles, living, near, the, extermination, camps, later, dug, up, human, remains, in, search, of, valuables, the, property, of, deported, jews, was, also, appropriated, by, germany, s, allies, and, collaborating, governments, even, puppet, states, such, as, vichy, france, and, norway, were, able, to, successfully, lay, claim, to, jewish, property, in, the, decades, after, the, war, swiss, banks, became, notorious, for, harboring, gold, deposited, by, nazis, who, had, stolen, it, during, the, holocaust, as, well, as, profiting, from, unclaimed, deposits, made, by, holocaust, victims, beginning, in, 1938, especially, in, germany, and, its, annexed, territories, many, jews, were, drafted, into, forced, labor, camps, and, segregated, work, details, these, camps, were, often, of, a, temporary, nature, and, typically, overseen, by, civilian, authorities, initially, mortality, did, not, increase, dramatically, after, mid, 1941, conditions, for, jewish, forced, laborers, drastically, worsened, and, death, rates, increased, even, private, companies, deliberately, subjected, workers, to, murderous, conditions, beginning, in, 1941, and, increasingly, as, time, went, on, jews, capable, of, employment, were, separated, from, others, who, were, usually, killed, they, were, typically, employed, in, non, skilled, jobs, and, could, be, replaced, easily, if, non, jewish, workers, were, available, but, those, in, skilled, positions, had, a, higher, chance, of, survival, although, conditions, varied, widely, between, camps, jewish, forced, laborers, were, typically, treated, worse, than, non, jewish, prisoners, and, suffered, much, higher, mortality, rates, in, mid, 1943, himmler, sought, to, bring, surviving, jewish, forced, laborers, under, the, control, of, the, ss, in, the, concentration, camp, system, some, of, the, forced, labor, camps, for, jews, and, some, ghettos, such, as, kovno, were, designated, concentration, camps, while, others, were, dissolved, and, surviving, prisoners, sent, to, a, concentration, camp, despite, many, deaths, as, many, as, 200, 000, jews, survived, the, war, inside, the, concentration, camps, although, most, holocaust, victims, were, never, imprisoned, in, a, concentration, camp, the, image, of, these, camps, is, a, popular, symbol, of, the, holocaust, including, the, soviet, prisoners, of, war, 13, million, people, were, brought, to, germany, for, forced, labor, the, largest, nationalities, were, soviet, and, polish, and, they, were, the, worst, treated, groups, except, for, roma, and, jews, soviet, and, polish, forced, laborers, endured, inadequate, food, and, medical, treatment, long, hours, and, abuse, by, employers, hundreds, of, thousands, died, many, others, were, forced, to, work, for, the, occupiers, without, leaving, their, country, of, residence, some, of, germany, s, allies, including, slovakia, and, hungary, agreed, to, deport, jews, to, protect, non, jews, from, german, demands, for, forced, labor, east, european, women, were, also, kidnapped, via, lapanka, to, serve, as, sex, slaves, of, german, soldiers, in, military, and, camp, brothels, despite, the, prohibition, of, relationships, including, fraternization, between, german, and, foreign, workers, which, imposed, the, penalty, of, imprisonment, and, death, gerlach, estimates, that, 200, 000, jews, survived, in, hiding, across, europe, knowledge, of, german, intentions, was, essential, to, take, action, but, many, struggled, to, believe, the, news, many, attempted, to, jump, from, trains, or, flee, ghettos, and, camps, but, successfully, escaping, and, living, in, hiding, was, extremely, difficult, and, often, unsuccessful, the, support, or, at, least, absence, of, active, opposition, of, the, local, population, was, essential, but, often, lacking, in, eastern, europe, those, in, hiding, depended, on, the, assistance, of, non, jews, having, money, social, connections, with, non, jews, a, non, jewish, appearance, perfect, command, of, the, local, language, determination, and, luck, played, a, major, role, in, determining, survival, jews, in, hiding, were, hunted, down, with, the, assistance, of, local, collaborators, and, rewards, offered, for, their, denunciation, the, death, penalty, was, sometimes, enforced, on, people, hiding, them, especially, in, eastern, europe, rescuers, motivations, varied, on, a, spectrum, from, altruism, to, expecting, sex, or, material, gain, it, was, not, uncommon, for, helpers, to, betray, or, murder, jews, if, their, money, ran, out, gerlach, argues, that, hundreds, of, thousands, of, jews, may, have, died, because, of, rumors, or, denunciations, and, many, others, never, attempted, to, escape, because, of, a, belief, it, was, hopeless, jews, participated, in, resistance, movements, in, most, european, countries, and, often, were, overrepresented, jews, were, not, always, welcome, particularly, in, nationalist, resistance, groups, some, of, which, killed, jews, particularly, in, belarus, with, its, favorable, geography, of, dense, forests, many, jews, joined, the, soviet, partisans, an, estimated, 20, 000, to, 25, 000, across, the, soviet, union, an, additional, 10, 000, to, 13, 000, jewish, non, combatants, lived, in, family, camps, in, eastern, european, forests, of, which, the, most, well, known, was, the, bielski, partisans, the, nazi, leaders, knew, that, their, actions, would, bring, international, condemnation, on, 26, june, 1942, bbc, services, in, all, languages, publicized, a, report, by, the, jewish, social, democratic, bund, and, other, resistance, groups, and, transmitted, by, the, polish, government, in, exile, documenting, the, killing, of, 700, 000, jews, in, poland, in, december, 1942, the, allies, then, known, as, the, united, nations, adopted, a, joint, declaration, condemning, the, systematic, murder, of, jews, most, neutral, countries, in, europe, maintained, a, pro, german, foreign, policy, during, the, war, nevertheless, some, jews, were, able, to, escape, to, neutral, countries, whose, policies, ranged, from, rescue, to, non, action, during, the, war, the, american, jewish, joint, distribution, committee, jdc, raised, 70, million, and, in, the, years, after, the, war, it, raised, 300, million, this, money, was, spent, aiding, emigrants, and, providing, direct, relief, in, the, form, of, parcels, and, other, assistance, to, jews, living, under, german, occupation, and, after, the, war, to, holocaust, survivors, the, united, states, banned, sending, relief, into, german, occupied, europe, after, entering, the, war, but, the, jdc, continued, to, do, so, from, 1939, to, 1944, 81, 000, european, jews, emigrated, with, the, jdc, s, assistance, throughout, the, war, no, detailed, photo, intelligence, study, was, carried, out, on, any, of, the, major, concentration, or, extermination, camps, appeals, from, jewish, representatives, to, the, american, and, british, governments, to, bomb, rail, lines, leading, to, the, camps, or, crematoriums, was, rejected, with, little, to, no, input, from, the, war, departments, of, the, united, states, or, united, kingdom, however, debate, exists, on, whether, a, military, response, would, have, impacted, on, the, holocaust, after, german, military, defeats, in, 1943, it, became, increasingly, evident, that, germany, would, lose, the, war, in, early, 1943, 45, 000, jews, were, deported, from, german, occupied, northern, greece, primarily, salonica, to, auschwitz, where, nearly, all, were, killed, after, italy, switched, sides, in, late, 1943, germany, deported, several, thousand, jews, from, italy, and, the, former, italian, occupation, zones, of, france, yugoslavia, albania, and, greece, with, limited, success, attempts, to, continue, deportations, in, western, europe, after, 1942, often, failed, because, of, jews, going, into, hiding, and, the, increasing, recalcitrance, of, local, authorities, most, danish, jews, escaped, to, sweden, with, the, help, of, the, danish, resistance, in, the, face, of, a, half, hearted, german, deportation, effort, in, late, 1943, additional, killings, in, 1943, and, 1944, eliminated, all, remaining, ghettos, and, most, surviving, jews, in, eastern, europe, belzec, sobibor, and, treblinka, were, shut, down, and, destroyed, the, largest, murder, action, after, 1942, was, that, against, the, hungarian, jews, after, the, german, invasion, of, hungary, in, 1944, the, hungarian, government, cooperated, closely, in, the, deportation, of, 437, 000, jews, in, eight, weeks, mostly, to, auschwitz, the, expropriation, of, jewish, property, was, useful, to, achieve, hungarian, economic, goals, and, sending, the, jews, as, forced, laborers, avoided, the, need, to, send, non, jewish, hungarians, those, who, survived, the, selection, were, forced, to, provide, construction, and, manufacturing, labor, as, part, of, a, last, ditch, effort, to, increase, the, production, of, fighter, aircraft, although, the, nazis, goal, of, eliminating, any, jewish, population, from, germany, had, largely, been, achieved, in, 1943, it, was, reversed, in, 1944, as, a, result, of, the, importation, of, these, jews, for, labor, following, allied, advances, the, ss, deported, concentration, camp, prisoners, to, camps, in, germany, and, austria, starting, in, mid, 1944, from, the, baltics, weak, and, sick, prisoners, were, often, killed, in, the, camp, and, others, were, forced, to, travel, by, rail, or, on, foot, usually, with, no, or, inadequate, food, those, who, could, not, keep, up, were, shot, the, evacuations, were, ordered, partly, to, retain, the, prisoners, as, forced, labor, and, partly, to, avoid, allowing, any, prisoners, to, fall, into, enemy, hands, in, october, and, november, 1944, 90, 000, jews, were, deported, from, budapest, to, the, austrian, border, the, transfer, of, prisoners, from, auschwitz, began, in, mid, 1944, the, gas, chambers, were, shut, down, and, destroyed, after, october, and, in, january, most, of, the, remaining, 67, 000, auschwitz, prisoners, were, sent, on, a, death, march, westwards, in, january, 1945, more, than, 700, 000, people, were, imprisoned, in, the, concentration, camp, system, of, whom, as, many, as, a, third, died, before, the, end, of, the, war, at, this, time, most, concentration, camp, prisoners, were, soviet, and, polish, civilians, either, arrested, for, real, or, supposed, resistance, or, for, attempting, to, escape, forced, labor, the, death, marches, led, to, the, breakdown, of, supplies, for, the, camps, that, continued, to, exist, causing, additional, deaths, although, there, was, no, systematic, killing, of, jews, during, the, death, marches, around, 70, 000, to, 100, 000, jews, died, in, the, last, months, of, the, war, many, of, the, death, march, survivors, ended, up, in, other, concentration, camps, that, were, liberated, in, 1945, during, the, western, allied, invasion, of, germany, the, liberators, found, piles, of, corpses, that, they, had, to, bulldoze, into, mass, graves, some, survivors, were, freed, there, and, others, had, been, liberated, by, the, red, army, during, its, march, westwards, around, six, million, jews, were, killed, of, the, six, million, victims, most, of, those, killed, were, from, eastern, europe, and, with, half, from, poland, alone, around, 1, 3, million, jews, who, had, once, lived, under, nazi, rule, or, in, one, of, germany, s, allies, survived, the, war, one, third, of, the, jewish, population, worldwide, and, two, thirds, of, european, jews, had, been, wiped, out, death, rates, varied, widely, due, to, a, variety, of, factors, and, approached, 100, percent, in, some, areas, some, reasons, why, survival, chances, varied, was, the, availability, of, emigration, and, protection, from, germany, s, allies, which, saved, around, 600, 000, jews, jewish, children, and, the, elderly, faced, even, lower, survival, rates, than, adults, it, is, considered, to, be, the, single, largest, genocide, in, human, history, the, deadliest, phase, of, the, holocaust, was, operation, reinhard, which, was, marked, by, the, introduction, of, extermination, camps, roughly, two, million, jews, were, killed, from, march, 1942, to, november, 1943, around, 1, 47, million, jews, were, murdered, in, just, 100, days, from, late, july, to, early, november, 1942, a, rate, approximately, 83, higher, than, the, commonly, suggested, figure, for, the, rwandan, genocide, between, july, to, october, 1942, two, million, jews, were, murdered, including, operation, reinhard, and, other, killings, with, over, three, million, jews, killed, in, 1942, alone, as, stated, by, historian, christian, gerlach, on, the, other, hand, historian, alex, j, kay, states, that, over, two, million, jews, were, murdered, from, late, july, to, mid, november, stating, that, these, three, and, a, half, months, were, the, most, intense, the, deadliest, of, the, entire, holocaust, it, was, the, fastest, rate, of, genocidal, killing, in, history, on, 3, november, 1943, around, 18, 400, jews, were, murdered, at, majdanek, over, the, course, of, nine, hours, in, what, was, the, largest, number, ever, killed, in, a, death, camp, on, a, single, day, it, was, part, of, operation, harvest, festival, the, murder, of, some, 43, 000, jews, the, single, largest, massacre, of, jews, by, german, forces, occurring, from, 3, to, 4, november, 1943, separate, nazi, persecutions, killed, a, similar, or, larger, number, of, non, jewish, civilians, and, pows, estimated, by, gerlach, at, 6, to, 8, million, at, more, than, 10, million, by, gilbert, and, at, over, 11, million, by, the, united, states, holocaust, memorial, museum, in, some, countries, such, as, hungary, jews, were, a, majority, of, civilian, deaths, in, poland, they, were, either, a, majority, or, about, half, in, other, countries, such, as, the, soviet, union, france, greece, and, yugoslavia, non, jewish, civilian, losses, outnumbered, jewish, deaths, after, liberation, many, jews, attempted, to, return, home, limited, success, in, finding, relatives, the, refusal, of, many, non, jews, to, return, property, and, violent, attacks, such, as, the, kielce, pogrom, convinced, many, survivors, to, leave, eastern, europe, antisemitism, was, reported, to, increase, in, several, countries, after, the, war, in, part, due, to, conflicts, over, property, restitution, when, the, war, ended, there, were, less, than, 28, 000, german, jews, and, 60, 000, non, german, jews, in, germany, by, 1947, the, number, of, jews, in, germany, had, increased, to, 250, 000, owing, to, emigration, from, eastern, europe, allowed, by, the, communist, authorities, jews, made, up, around, 25, percent, of, the, population, of, displaced, persons, camps, although, many, survivors, were, in, poor, health, they, attempted, to, organize, self, government, in, these, camps, including, education, and, rehabilitation, efforts, due, to, the, reluctance, of, other, countries, to, allow, their, immigration, many, survivors, remained, in, germany, until, the, establishment, of, israel, in, 1948, others, moved, to, the, united, states, around, 1950, due, to, loosened, immigration, restrictions, most, holocaust, perpetrators, were, never, put, on, trial, for, their, crimes, during, and, after, world, war, ii, many, european, countries, launched, widespread, purges, of, real, and, perceived, collaborators, that, affected, possibly, as, much, as, 2, 3, percent, of, the, population, of, europe, although, most, of, the, resulting, trials, did, not, emphasize, crimes, against, jews, nazi, atrocities, led, to, the, united, nations, genocide, convention, in, 1948, but, it, was, not, used, in, holocaust, trials, due, to, the, non, retroactivity, of, criminal, laws, in, 1945, and, 1946, the, international, military, tribunal, tried, 23, nazi, leaders, primarily, for, waging, wars, of, aggression, which, the, prosecution, argued, was, the, root, of, nazi, criminality, nevertheless, the, systematic, murder, of, jews, came, to, take, center, stage, this, trial, and, others, held, by, the, allies, in, occupied, germany, the, united, states, army, alone, charged, 1, 676, defendants, in, 462, war, crimes, trials, were, widely, perceived, as, an, unjust, form, of, political, revenge, by, the, german, public, west, germany, later, investigated, 100, 000, people, and, tried, more, than, 6, 000, defendants, mainly, low, level, perpetrators, the, high, level, organizer, adolf, eichmann, was, kidnapped, and, tried, in, israel, in, 1961, instead, of, convicting, eichmann, on, the, basis, of, documentary, evidence, israeli, prosecutors, asked, many, holocaust, survivors, to, testify, a, strategy, that, increased, publicity, but, has, proven, controversial, historians, estimate, that, property, losses, to, jews, of, germany, austria, the, netherlands, france, poland, and, hungary, amounted, to, around, 10, billion, in, 1944, dollars, or, 170, billion, in, 2023, this, estimate, does, not, include, the, value, of, labor, extracted, overall, the, amount, of, jewish, property, looted, by, the, nazis, was, about, 10, percent, of, the, total, stolen, from, occupied, countries, efforts, by, survivors, to, receive, reparations, for, their, losses, began, immediately, after, world, war, ii, there, was, an, additional, wave, of, restitution, efforts, in, the, 1990s, connected, to, the, fall, of, communism, in, eastern, europe, between, 1945, and, 2018, germany, paid, 86, 8, billion, in, restitution, and, compensation, to, holocaust, survivors, and, heirs, in, 1952, west, germany, negotiated, an, agreement, to, pay, dm, 3, billion, around, 714, million, to, israel, and, dm, 450, million, around, 107, million, to, the, claims, conference, germany, paid, pensions, and, other, reparations, for, harm, done, to, some, holocaust, survivors, other, countries, have, paid, restitution, for, assets, stolen, from, jews, from, these, countries, most, western, european, countries, restored, some, property, to, jews, after, the, war, while, communist, countries, nationalized, many, formerly, jewish, assets, meaning, that, the, overall, amount, restored, to, jews, has, been, lower, in, those, countries, poland, is, the, only, member, of, the, european, union, that, never, passed, any, restitution, legislation, many, restitution, programs, fell, short, of, restoration, of, prewar, assets, and, in, particular, large, amounts, of, immovable, property, was, never, returned, to, survivors, or, their, heirs, in, the, decades, after, the, war, holocaust, memory, was, largely, confined, to, the, survivors, and, their, communities, the, popularity, of, holocaust, memory, peaked, in, the, 1990s, after, the, fall, of, communism, and, became, central, to, western, historical, consciousness, as, a, symbol, of, the, ultimate, human, evil, genocide, scholar, a, dirk, moses, asserted, that, the, holocaust, has, gradually, supplanted, genocide, as, modernity, s, icon, of, evil, while, political, scientist, scott, straus, declared, that, the, holocaust, perhaps, more, than, any, other, event, in, the, past, century, represents, the, pinnacle, of, evil, the, holocaust, has, been, described, as, perhaps, the, most, savage, and, significant, single, crime, in, recorded, history, and, that, of, the, most, barbaric, events, in, the, twentieth, century, the, holocaust, probably, ranks, as, the, very, worst, renowned, german, historian, wolfgang, benz, described, it, as, the, singularly, most, monstrous, crime, committed, in, the, history, of, mankind, holocaust, education, in, which, its, advocates, argue, promotes, citizenship, while, reducing, prejudice, generally, became, widespread, at, the, same, time, international, holocaust, remembrance, day, is, commemorated, each, year, on, 27, january, while, some, other, countries, have, set, a, different, memorial, day, it, has, been, commemorated, in, memorials, museums, and, speeches, as, well, as, works, of, culture, such, as, novels, poems, films, and, plays, denial, of, the, holocaust, is, a, criminal, offense, in, some, countries, while, denials, of, the, holocaust, have, been, promoted, by, various, middle, eastern, governments, figures, and, media, although, many, are, convinced, that, there, are, lessons, or, some, kind, of, redemptive, meaning, to, be, drawn, from, the, holocaust, whether, this, is, the, case, and, what, these, lessons, are, is, disputed, communist, states, marginalized, the, topic, of, antisemitic, persecution, while, eliding, their, nationals, collaboration, with, nazism, a, tendency, that, continued, into, the, post, communist, era, in, west, germany, a, self, critical, memory, of, the, holocaust, developed, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, and, spread, to, some, other, western, european, countries, the, national, memories, of, the, holocaust, were, extended, to, the, european, union, as, a, whole, in, which, holocaust, memory, has, provided, both, shared, history, and, an, emotional, rationale, for, committing, to, human, rights, participation, in, this, memory, is, required, of, countries, seeking, entry, in, contrast, to, europe, in, the, united, states, the, memory, of, the, holocaust, tends, to, be, more, abstract, and, universalized, during, apartheid, the, holocaust, was, evoked, widely, and, divergently, by, jews, and, non, jews, alike, whether, holocaust, memory, actually, promotes, human, rights, is, disputed, in, israel, the, memory, of, the, holocaust, has, been, used, at, times, to, justify, the, use, of, force, and, violation, of, international, human, rights, norms, in, particular, as, part, of, the, israeli, palestinian, conflict, the, holocaust, is, the, most, well, known, genocide, in, history, and, is, considered, to, be, the, single, most, infamous, case, of, genocide, in, european, history, as, well, it, is, the, single, most, documented, and, studied, genocide, in, history, it, is, also, seen, as, the, archetype, of, genocide, and, the, benchmark, in, genocide, studies, the, scholarly, literature, on, the, holocaust, is, massive, encompassing, thousands, of, books, the, tendency, to, see, the, holocaust, as, a, unique, or, incomprehensible, event, continues, to, be, popular, among, the, broader, public, after, being, largely, rejected, by, historians, scholar, omer, bartov, points, out, how, the, holocaust, was, unique, in, that, it, was, the, industrial, killing, of, millions, of, human, beings, in, factories, of, death, ordered, by, a, modern, state, organized, by, a, conscientious, bureaucracy, and, supported, by, a, law, abiding, patriotic, civilized, society, another, debate, concerns, whether, the, holocaust, emerged, from, western, civilization, or, was, an, aberration, of, it, the, jewish, population, still, remains, below, pre, holocaust, levels, according, to, the, central, bureau, of, statistics, of, israel, the, world, jewish, population, reached, 15, 2, million, by, the, end, of, 2020, approximately, 1, 4, million, less, than, on, the, eve, of, the, holocaust, in, 1939, when, the, number, was, 16, 6, million, final, solution
