can, be, found, in, every, medieval, society, and, culture, the, participation, of, sports, ball, games, to, be, exact, at, the, time, loosened, control, the, ruling, class, had, over, the, peasants, this, is, not, a, rare, trend, throughout, history, by, the, fourteenth, century, no, fewer, than, thirty, bans, have, been, placed, by, english, kings, on, ball, games, such, as, football, handball, and, hurling, the, middle, ages, were, not, immediately, devoid, of, sports, from, the, roman, empire, after, it, collapsed, gladiatorial, bouts, and, chariot, racing, continued, sporadically, and, intermittently, well, into, the, middle, ages, they, would, eventually, fade, away, and, be, replaced, by, local, activities, hawking, however, was, the, particular, reserve, of, emperors, and, kings, this, sport, would, be, one, of, the, few, sports, continued, in, the, middle, ages, frederick, ii, holy, roman, emperor, may, have, played, a, critical, role, in, its, persistence, as, he, was, an, avid, hawker, who, authored, the, first, comprehensive, book, on, falconry, furthermore, kings, may, have, followed, the, example, of, falconry, as, to, mimic, the, status, of, an, emperor, during, the, middle, ages, tournaments, were, not, an, uncommon, occurrence, after, all, war, was, a, constant, threat, that, could, occur, often, thus, preparation, for, war, is, practice, practice, is, competition, and, competition, is, sport, consequently, before, the, establishment, of, sports, history, the, medieval, hallmarks, of, upper, class, sports, i, e, jousting, mock, combat, and, blood, sports, were, generally, agreed, upon, as, military, training, modern, sports, historians, however, debate, that, such, sports, were, for, entertainment, purposes, one, example, considered, were, tournaments, which, offered, little, to, prepare, one, for, actual, war, and, would, likely, have, set, any, forms, of, real, training, back, tournaments, in, the, middle, ages, arose, out, of, local, festivals, as, a, result, many, tournaments, had, their, own, local, characteristic, but, were, uniform, in, habits, and, customs, of, the, region, the, tournament, was, stationed, in, medieval, tournaments, presents, characteristics, of, modern, sport, as, those, ex, professional, knights, who, were, most, successful, and, popular, perhaps, the, only, medieval, equivalent, to, today, s, sports, stars, followed, the, money, and, fame, of, the, tournament, circuit, those, with, political, backing, and, social, favor, were, able, to, accumulate, property, and, goods, to, ensure, a, comfortable, life, after, their, competitive, days, were, over, the, tournament, was, a, market, and, a, social, mixer, these, tournaments, consequently, attracted, many, people, to, attend, for, various, purposes, such, as, marriages, and, trade, of, livestock, and, land, or, wares, provided, by, merchants, and, vendors, s, bastien, nadot, writes, that, sport, already, existed, in, the, 15th, century, he, shows, that, the, organization, of, the, chivalry, around, european, contests, worked, like, a, system, in, an, elaborate, network, he, evokes, an, chivalrous, international, sharing, the, same, codes, especially, at, tournaments, and, games, these, sporting, events, went, beyond, borders, and, were, accompanied, by, a, common, cultural, base, including, courtesy, fair, play, honor, and, loyalty, the, middle, ages, also, revealed, the, importance, of, owning, a, horse, common, to, the, sports, and, amusements, of, the, ruling, class, was, the, horse, if, someone, of, the, ruling, class, did, not, own, a, horse, it, would, represent, that, they, did, not, have, much, wealth, and, leisure, since, they, would, be, unable, to, participate, in, certain, activities, like, horse, racing, after, the, late, middle, ages, early, modern, sports, became, less, of, a, violent, or, military, training, activity, and, more, of, an, activity, done, for, recreational, benefit, in, europe, during, the, renaissance, educators, and, medical, surgeons, promoted, playing, sports, because, of, their, numerous, physical, and, psychological, benefits, to, the, human, body, during, this, era, there, was, also, support, for, moderating, sports, as, it, was, viewed, as, more, for, leisure, than, a, strict, procedure, open, air, sporting, events, became, an, attraction, for, many, and, people, of, all, different, social, hierarchies, were, involved, in, this, new, culture, these, new, radical, ideas, about, sports, made, their, way, into, books, and, films, and, eventually, became, part, of, the, social, culture, during, the, renaissance, as, mentioned, by, mike, huggins, gargantua, written, by, fran, ois, rabelais, was, a, well, known, novel, published, in, 1534, that, mentioned, sports, and, games, as, a, unit, like, many, other, renowned, works, of, literature, all, different, types, of, sports, became, a, functional, unit, in, many, people, s, routines, and, it, brought, refreshment, into, people, s, lives, as, the, popularity, and, involvement, of, sports, increased, rules, began, to, form, and, sports, became, more, regulated, so, they, could, be, fair, sports, clubs, and, associations, which, provided, a, sense, of, unity, also, became, more, common, especially, for, elite, sports, such, as, horse, racing, cockfighting, hunting, and, tennis, during, the, sixteenth, and, seventeenth, centuries, for, example, charles, ii, formed, 20, rules, for, horse, racing, in, 1665, sports, were, a, form, of, entertainment, for, spectators, who, did, not, play, themselves, there, were, stake, money, contests, and, prizes, in, these, sports, and, racing, competitions, these, modern, advancements, and, developments, made, about, sporting, life, in, the, renaissance, in, europe, eventually, made, their, way, to, asia, africa, and, latin, america, some, historians, most, notably, bernard, lewis, claim, that, team, sports, as, we, know, them, today, are, primarily, an, invention, of, western, culture, british, prime, minister, john, major, was, more, explicit, in, 1995, the, traditional, team, sports, are, seen, as, springing, primarily, from, britain, and, subsequently, exported, across, the, vast, british, empire, european, colonialism, helped, spread, particular, games, around, the, world, especially, cricket, not, directly, related, to, baseball, football, of, various, sorts, bowling, in, a, number, of, forms, cue, sports, like, snooker, carom, billiards, and, pool, hockey, and, its, derivatives, equestrian, tennis, and, many, winter, sports, the, originally, european, dominated, modern, olympic, games, generally, also, ensured, standardization, in, particularly, european, especially, british, directions, when, rules, for, similar, games, around, the, world, were, merged, regardless, of, game, origins, the, industrial, revolution, and, mass, production, brought, increased, leisure, which, allowed, more, time, to, engage, in, playing, or, observing, and, gambling, upon, spectator, sports, as, well, as, less, elitism, in, and, greater, accessibility, of, sports, of, many, kinds, with, the, advent, of, mass, media, and, global, communication, professionalism, became, prevalent, in, sports, and, this, furthered, sports, popularity, in, general, with, the, increasing, values, placed, on, those, who, won, also, came, the, increased, desire, to, cheat, some, of, the, most, common, ways, of, cheating, today, involve, the, use, of, performance, enhancing, drugs, such, as, steroids, the, use, of, these, drugs, has, always, been, frowned, on, but, in, recent, history, there, have, also, been, agencies, set, up, to, monitor, professional, athletes, and, ensure, fair, play, in, the, sport, writing, about, cricket, in, particular, john, leech, has, explained, the, role, of, puritan, power, the, english, civil, war, and, the, restoration, of, the, monarchy, in, england, the, long, parliament, in, 1642, banned, theatres, which, had, met, with, puritan, disapproval, although, similar, action, would, be, taken, against, certain, sports, it, is, not, clear, if, cricket, was, in, any, way, prohibited, except, that, players, must, not, break, the, sabbath, in, 1660, the, restoration, of, the, monarchy, in, england, was, immediately, followed, by, the, reopening, of, the, theaters, and, so, any, sanctions, that, had, been, imposed, by, the, puritans, on, cricket, would, also, have, been, lifted, he, goes, on, to, make, the, key, point, that, political, social, and, economic, conditions, in, the, aftermath, of, the, restoration, encouraged, excessive, gambling, so, much, so, that, a, gambling, act, was, deemed, necessary, in, 1664, it, is, certain, that, cricket, horse, racing, and, boxing, i, e, prizefighting, were, financed, by, gambling, interests, leech, explains, that, it, was, the, habit, of, cricket, patrons, all, of, whom, were, gamblers, to, form, strong, teams, through, the, 18th, century, to, represent, their, interests, he, defines, a, strong, team, as, one, representative, of, more, than, one, parish, and, he, is, certain, that, such, teams, were, first, assembled, in, or, immediately, after, 1660, prior, to, the, english, civil, war, and, the, commonwealth, all, available, evidence, concludes, that, cricket, had, evolved, to, the, level, of, village, cricket, only, where, teams, that, are, strictly, representative, of, individual, parishes, compete, the, strong, teams, of, the, post, restoration, mark, the, evolution, of, cricket, and, indeed, of, professional, team, sport, for, cricket, is, the, oldest, professional, team, sport, from, the, parish, standard, to, the, county, standard, this, was, the, point, of, origin, for, major, or, first, class, cricket, the, year, 1660, also, marks, the, origin, of, professional, team, sport, all, england, cricket, teams, have, played, since, 1739, a, number, of, the, public, schools, such, as, winchester, and, eton, introduced, variants, of, football, and, other, sports, for, their, pupils, these, were, described, at, the, time, as, innocent, and, lawful, certainly, in, comparison, with, the, rougher, rural, games, with, urbanization, in, the, 19th, century, the, rural, games, moved, to, the, new, urban, centres, and, came, under, the, influence, of, the, middle, and, upper, classes, the, rules, and, regulations, devised, at, english, institutions, began, to, be, applied, to, the, wider, game, with, governing, bodies, in, england, being, set, up, for, a, number, of, sports, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, rising, influence, of, the, upper, class, also, produced, an, emphasis, on, the, amateur, and, the, spirit, of, fair, play, the, industrial, revolution, also, brought, with, it, increasing, mobility, and, created, the, opportunity, for, universities, in, britain, and, elsewhere, to, compete, with, one, another, this, sparked, increasing, attempts, to, unify, and, reconcile, various, games, in, england, leading, to, the, establishment, of, the, football, association, in, london, the, first, official, governing, body, in, football, for, sports, to, become, professionalized, coaching, had, to, come, first, it, gradually, professionalized, in, the, victorian, era, and, the, role, was, well, established, by, 1914, in, the, first, world, war, military, units, sought, out, the, coaches, to, supervise, physical, conditioning, and, develop, morale, building, teams, sport, became, an, important, part, of, military, life, for, british, servicemen, serving, around, the, world, the, influence, of, british, sports, and, their, codified, rules, began, to, spread, across, the, world, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, particularly, association, football, a, number, of, major, teams, elsewhere, in, the, world, still, show, these, british, origins, in, their, names, such, as, a, c, milan, in, italy, gr, mio, foot, ball, porto, alegrense, in, brazil, and, athletic, bilbao, in, spain, cricket, became, popular, in, several, of, the, nations, of, the, then, british, empire, such, as, australia, south, africa, india, and, pakistan, and, remain, popular, in, and, beyond, today, s, commonwealth, of, nations, the, revival, of, the, olympic, games, by, baron, pierre, de, coubertin, was, also, heavily, influenced, by, the, amateur, ethos, of, the, english, public, schools, the, british, played, a, major, role, in, defining, amateurism, professionalism, the, tournament, system, and, the, concept, of, fair, play, some, sports, developed, in, england, spread, to, other, countries, and, then, lost, its, popularity, in, england, while, remaining, actively, played, in, other, countries, a, notable, example, being, bandy, which, remains, popular, in, finland, kazakhstan, norway, russia, and, sweden, european, morals, and, views, on, empires, were, embedded, in, the, structure, of, sports, ideas, of, social, discipline, and, loyalty, were, key, factors, in, european, empire, ettiequte, which, eventually, transferred, into, sports, ettiequte, also, ideas, of, patient, and, methodical, training, were, enforced, to, make, soldiers, stronger, and, athletes, better, diffusion, helped, with, the, process, of, connecting, these, two, concepts, and, has, helped, shaped, the, values, of, sports, as, we, know, it, today, sports, like, baseball, football, soccer, and, cricket, all, came, from, european, influence, and, all, share, the, same, values, based, on, european, empires, baseball, closely, related, to, english, rounders, and, french, la, soule, and, less, clearly, connected, to, cricket, became, established, in, the, urban, northeastern, united, states, with, the, first, rules, being, codified, in, the, 1840s, while, american, football, was, very, popular, in, the, south, east, with, baseball, spreading, to, the, south, and, american, football, spreading, to, the, north, after, the, civil, war, there, is, documented, evidence, of, baseball, in, england, an, extract, from, an, 18th, century, diary, containing, the, oldest, known, reference, to, baseball, is, among, the, items, on, display, in, a, new, exhibition, in, london, exploring, the, english, origins, and, cricketing, connections, of, america, s, national, sport, while, baseball, was, once, claimed, to, have, been, invented, in, the, u, s, in, the, mid, 19th, century, recent, findings, suggest, a, sport, of, the, same, name, may, have, evolved, decades, earlier, alongside, cricket, crossing, the, atlantic, with, english, settlers, to, the, american, colonies, one, notable, discovery, found, in, a, shed, in, a, village, in, surrey, southern, england, in, 2008, was, a, handwritten, 18th, century, diary, belonging, to, a, local, lawyer, william, bray, went, to, stoke, church, this, morn, wrote, bray, on, easter, monday, in, 1755, after, dinner, went, to, miss, jeale, s, to, play, at, base, ball, with, her, the, 3, miss, whiteheads, miss, billinghurst, miss, molly, flutter, mr, chandler, mr, ford, and, h, parsons, drank, tea, and, stayed, til, 8, in, the, 1870s, the, game, split, between, the, professionals, and, amateurs, the, professional, game, rapidly, gained, dominance, and, marked, a, shift, in, the, focus, from, the, player, to, the, club, the, rise, of, baseball, also, helped, squeeze, out, other, sports, such, as, cricket, which, had, been, popular, in, philadelphia, prior, to, the, rise, of, baseball, american, football, and, gridiron, football, more, generally, also, has, its, origins, in, the, english, variants, of, the, game, with, the, first, set, of, intercollegiate, football, rules, based, directly, on, the, rules, of, the, football, association, in, london, however, harvard, chose, to, play, a, game, based, on, the, rules, of, rugby, football, walter, camp, would, then, heavily, modify, this, variant, in, the, 1880s, with, the, modifications, also, heavily, influencing, the, rules, of, canadian, football, worldwide, the, british, influence, includes, many, different, football, codes, lawn, bowls, lawn, tennis, and, other, sports, the, major, impetus, for, this, was, the, patenting, of, the, world, s, first, lawn, mower, in, 1830, this, allowed, for, the, preparation, of, modern, ovals, playing, fields, pitches, grass, courts, etc, most, sports, in, the, united, states, evolved, out, of, european, practices, however, basketball, volleyball, skateboarding, water, skiing, and, snowboarding, are, north, american, inventions, some, of, which, have, become, popular, in, other, countries, however, lacrosse, and, surfing, in, particular, arose, from, native, american, and, native, hawaiian, activities, that, predate, western, contact, the, 21st, century, has, seen, a, move, towards, adventure, sports, as, a, form, of, individual, escapism, transcending, the, routines, of, life, examples, include, white, water, rafting, paragliding, canyoning, base, jumping, and, orienteering, women, s, competition, in, sports, has, been, frowned, upon, by, many, societies, in, the, past, the, english, public, school, background, of, organized, sport, in, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, led, to, a, paternalism, that, tended, to, discourage, women, s, involvement, in, sports, with, for, example, no, women, officially, competing, in, the, 1896, olympic, games, the, 20th, century, saw, major, advances, in, the, participation, of, women, in, sports, due, to, a, growing, women, s, sports, movement, in, europe, and, north, america, this, led, to, the, initiation, of, the, women, s, olympiad, held, three, times, 1921, 1922, and, 1923, and, the, women, s, world, games, held, four, times, 1922, 1926, 1930, and, 1934, in, 1924, the, 1924, women, s, olympiad, was, held, in, london, the, increase, in, girls, and, women, s, participation, in, sport, has, been, partly, influenced, by, the, women, s, rights, and, feminist, movements, of, the, nineteenth, and, twentieth, centuries, respectively, in, the, united, states, female, student, participation, in, sports, was, significantly, boosted, by, the, title, ix, act, in, 1972,
