kingdom, of, england, the, hundred, years, war, french, guerre, de, cent, ans, 1337, 1453, was, a, conflict, between, the, kingdoms, of, england, and, france, and, a, civil, war, in, france, during, the, late, middle, ages, it, emerged, from, feudal, disputes, over, the, duchy, of, aquitaine, and, was, triggered, by, a, claim, to, the, french, throne, made, by, edward, iii, of, england, the, war, grew, into, a, broader, military, economic, and, political, struggle, involving, factions, from, across, western, europe, fuelled, by, emerging, nationalism, on, both, sides, the, periodisation, of, the, war, typically, charts, it, as, taking, place, over, 116, years, however, it, was, an, intermittent, conflict, which, was, frequently, interrupted, by, external, factors, such, as, the, black, death, and, several, years, of, truces, the, hundred, years, war, was, a, significant, conflict, in, the, middle, ages, during, the, war, five, generations, of, kings, from, two, rival, dynasties, fought, for, the, throne, of, france, which, was, then, the, dominant, kingdom, in, western, europe, the, war, had, a, lasting, effect, on, european, history, both, sides, produced, innovations, in, military, technology, and, tactics, including, professional, standing, armies, and, artillery, that, permanently, changed, european, warfare, chivalry, which, reached, its, height, during, the, conflict, subsequently, declined, stronger, national, identities, took, root, in, both, kingdoms, which, became, more, centralized, and, gradually, emerged, as, global, powers, the, term, hundred, years, war, was, adopted, by, later, historians, as, a, historiographical, periodisation, to, encompass, dynastically, related, conflicts, constructing, the, longest, military, conflict, in, european, history, the, war, is, commonly, divided, into, three, phases, separated, by, truces, the, edwardian, war, 1337, 1360, the, caroline, war, 1369, 1389, and, the, lancastrian, war, 1415, 1453, each, side, drew, many, allies, into, the, conflict, with, english, forces, initially, prevailing, however, the, french, forces, under, the, house, of, valois, ultimately, retained, control, over, the, kingdom, of, france, the, french, and, english, monarchies, thereafter, remained, separate, despite, the, monarchs, of, england, later, britain, styling, themselves, as, sovereigns, of, france, until, 1802, the, root, causes, of, the, conflict, can, be, traced, to, the, crisis, of, 14th, century, europe, the, outbreak, of, war, was, motivated, by, a, gradual, rise, in, tension, between, the, kings, of, france, and, england, over, territory, the, official, pretext, was, the, interruption, of, the, direct, male, line, of, the, capetian, dynasty, tensions, between, the, french, and, english, crowns, had, gone, back, centuries, to, the, origins, of, the, english, royal, family, which, was, french, norman, and, later, angevin, in, origin, through, william, the, conqueror, the, norman, duke, who, became, king, of, england, in, 1066, english, monarchs, had, therefore, historically, held, titles, and, lands, within, france, which, made, them, vassals, to, the, kings, of, france, the, status, of, the, english, king, s, french, fiefs, was, a, significant, source, of, conflict, between, the, two, monarchies, throughout, the, middle, ages, french, monarchs, systematically, sought, to, check, the, growth, of, english, power, stripping, away, lands, as, the, opportunity, arose, mainly, whenever, england, was, at, war, with, scotland, an, ally, of, france, english, holdings, in, france, had, varied, in, size, at, some, points, dwarfing, even, the, french, royal, domain, by, 1337, however, only, guyenne, and, gascony, were, english, in, 1328, charles, iv, of, france, died, without, any, sons, or, brothers, and, a, new, principle, salic, law, disallowed, female, succession, charles, s, closest, male, relative, was, his, nephew, edward, iii, of, england, whose, mother, isabella, was, charles, s, sister, isabella, claimed, the, throne, of, france, for, her, son, by, the, rule, of, proximity, of, blood, but, the, french, nobility, rejected, this, maintaining, that, isabella, could, not, transmit, a, right, she, did, not, possess, an, assembly, of, french, barons, decided, that, a, native, frenchman, should, receive, the, crown, rather, than, edward, the, throne, passed, to, charles, s, patrilineal, cousin, instead, philip, count, of, valois, edward, protested, but, ultimately, submitted, and, did, homage, for, gascony, further, french, disagreements, with, edward, induced, philip, during, may, 1337, to, meet, with, his, great, council, in, paris, it, was, agreed, that, gascony, should, be, taken, back, into, philip, s, hands, which, prompted, edward, to, renew, his, claim, for, the, french, throne, this, time, by, force, of, arms, in, the, early, years, of, the, war, the, english, led, by, their, king, and, his, son, edward, the, black, prince, saw, resounding, successes, notably, at, cr, cy, 1346, and, at, poitiers, 1356, where, king, john, ii, of, france, was, taken, prisoner, by, 1378, under, king, charles, v, the, wise, and, the, leadership, of, bertrand, du, guesclin, the, french, had, reconquered, most, of, the, lands, ceded, to, king, edward, in, the, treaty, of, br, tigny, signed, in, 1360, leaving, the, english, with, only, a, few, cities, on, the, continent, in, the, following, decades, the, weakening, of, royal, authority, combined, with, the, devastation, caused, by, the, black, death, of, 1347, 1351, which, killed, nearly, half, of, france, and, 20, 33, of, england, and, the, significant, economic, crisis, that, followed, led, to, a, period, of, civil, unrest, in, both, countries, these, crises, were, resolved, in, england, earlier, than, in, france, the, newly, crowned, henry, v, of, england, seized, the, opportunity, presented, by, the, mental, illness, of, charles, vi, of, france, and, the, french, civil, war, between, armagnacs, and, burgundians, to, revive, the, conflict, overwhelming, victories, at, agincourt, 1415, and, verneuil, 1424, as, well, as, an, alliance, with, the, burgundians, raised, the, prospects, of, an, ultimate, english, triumph, and, persuaded, the, english, to, continue, the, war, over, many, decades, a, variety, of, factors, prevented, this, however, notable, influences, include, the, deaths, of, both, henry, and, charles, in, 1422, the, emergence, of, joan, of, arc, which, boosted, french, morale, and, the, loss, of, burgundy, as, an, ally, concluding, the, french, civil, war, the, siege, of, orl, ans, 1429, made, english, aspirations, for, conquest, all, but, infeasible, despite, joan, s, capture, by, the, burgundians, and, her, subsequent, execution, 1431, a, series, of, crushing, french, victories, concluded, the, siege, favoring, the, valois, dynasty, notably, patay, 1429, formigny, 1450, and, castillon, 1453, proved, decisive, in, ending, the, war, england, permanently, lost, most, of, its, continental, possessions, with, only, the, pale, of, calais, remaining, under, its, control, on, the, continent, until, the, siege, of, calais, 1558, local, conflicts, in, neighbouring, areas, which, were, contemporarily, related, to, the, war, including, the, war, of, the, breton, succession, 1341, 1364, the, castilian, civil, war, 1366, 1369, the, war, of, the, two, peters, 1356, 1369, in, aragon, and, the, 1383, 1385, crisis, in, portugal, were, used, by, the, parties, to, advance, their, agendas, by, the, war, s, end, feudal, armies, had, mainly, been, replaced, by, professional, troops, and, aristocratic, dominance, had, yielded, to, a, democratization, of, the, manpower, and, weapons, of, armies, although, primarily, a, dynastic, conflict, the, war, inspired, french, and, english, nationalism, the, broader, introduction, of, weapons, and, tactics, supplanted, the, feudal, armies, where, heavy, cavalry, had, dominated, and, artillery, became, important, the, war, precipitated, the, creation, of, the, first, standing, armies, in, western, europe, since, the, western, roman, empire, and, helped, change, their, role, in, warfare, civil, wars, deadly, epidemics, famines, and, bandit, free, companies, of, mercenaries, reduced, the, population, drastically, in, france, but, at, the, end, of, the, war, the, french, had, the, upper, hand, due, to, their, better, supply, such, as, small, hand, held, cannons, weapons, etc, in, england, political, forces, over, time, came, to, oppose, the, costly, venture, after, the, war, england, was, left, insolvent, leaving, the, conquering, french, in, complete, control, of, all, of, france, except, calais, the, dissatisfaction, of, english, nobles, resulting, from, the, loss, of, their, continental, landholdings, as, well, as, the, general, shock, at, losing, a, war, in, which, investment, had, been, so, significant, helped, lead, to, the, wars, of, the, roses, 1455, 1487, the, economic, consequences, of, the, hundred, years, war, not, only, produced, a, decline, in, trade, but, also, led, to, a, high, collection, of, taxes, from, both, countries, which, played, a, significant, role, in, civil, disorder, the, question, of, female, succession, to, the, french, throne, was, raised, after, the, death, of, louis, x, in, 1316, louis, left, behind, a, young, daughter, joan, ii, of, navarre, and, a, son, john, i, of, france, although, he, only, lived, for, five, days, however, joan, s, paternity, was, in, question, as, her, mother, margaret, of, burgundy, was, accused, of, being, an, adulterer, in, the, tour, de, nesle, affair, given, the, situation, philip, count, of, poitiers, and, brother, of, louis, x, positioned, himself, to, take, the, crown, advancing, the, stance, that, women, should, be, ineligible, to, succeed, to, the, french, throne, he, won, over, his, adversaries, through, his, political, sagacity, and, succeeded, to, the, french, throne, as, philip, v, when, he, died, in, 1322, leaving, only, daughters, behind, the, crown, passed, to, his, younger, brother, charles, iv, charles, iv, died, in, 1328, leaving, behind, his, young, daughter, and, pregnant, wife, joan, of, vreux, he, decreed, that, he, would, become, king, if, the, unborn, child, were, male, if, not, charles, left, the, choice, of, his, successor, to, the, nobles, joan, gave, birth, to, a, girl, blanche, of, france, later, duchess, of, orleans, with, charles, iv, s, death, and, blanche, s, birth, the, main, male, line, of, the, house, of, capet, was, rendered, extinct, by, proximity, of, blood, the, nearest, male, relative, of, charles, iv, was, his, nephew, edward, iii, of, england, edward, was, the, son, of, isabella, the, sister, of, the, dead, charles, iv, but, the, question, arose, whether, she, could, transmit, a, right, to, inherit, that, she, did, not, possess, moreover, the, french, nobility, baulked, at, the, prospect, of, being, ruled, by, an, englishman, especially, one, whose, mother, isabella, and, her, lover, roger, mortimer, were, widely, suspected, of, having, murdered, the, previous, english, king, edward, ii, the, french, barons, prelates, and, the, university, of, paris, assemblies, decided, that, males, who, derive, their, right, to, inheritance, through, their, mother, should, be, excluded, from, consideration, therefore, excluding, edward, the, nearest, heir, through, the, male, line, was, charles, iv, s, first, cousin, philip, count, of, valois, and, it, was, decided, that, he, should, take, the, throne, he, was, crowned, philip, vi, in, 1328, in, 1340, the, avignon, papacy, confirmed, that, under, salic, law, males, would, not, be, able, to, inherit, through, their, mothers, eventually, edward, iii, reluctantly, recognized, philip, vi, and, paid, him, homage, for, the, duchy, of, aquitaine, and, gascony, in, 1329, he, made, concessions, in, guyenne, but, reserved, the, right, to, reclaim, territories, arbitrarily, confiscated, after, that, he, expected, to, be, left, undisturbed, while, he, made, war, on, scotland, tensions, between, the, french, and, english, monarchies, can, be, traced, back, to, the, 1066, norman, conquest, of, england, in, which, the, english, throne, was, seized, by, the, duke, of, normandy, a, vassal, of, the, king, of, france, as, a, result, the, crown, of, england, was, held, by, a, succession, of, nobles, who, already, owned, lands, in, france, which, put, them, among, the, most, influential, subjects, of, the, french, king, as, they, could, now, draw, upon, the, economic, power, of, england, to, enforce, their, interests, in, the, mainland, to, the, kings, of, france, this, threatened, their, royal, authority, and, so, they, would, constantly, try, to, undermine, english, rule, in, france, while, the, english, monarchs, would, struggle, to, protect, and, expand, their, lands, this, clash, of, interests, was, the, root, cause, of, much, of, the, conflict, between, the, french, and, english, monarchies, throughout, the, medieval, era, the, anglo, norman, dynasty, that, had, ruled, england, since, the, norman, conquest, of, 1066, was, brought, to, an, end, when, henry, the, son, of, geoffrey, of, anjou, and, empress, matilda, and, great, grandson, of, william, the, conqueror, became, the, first, of, the, angevin, kings, of, england, in, 1154, as, henry, ii, the, angevin, kings, ruled, over, what, was, later, known, as, the, angevin, empire, which, included, more, french, territory, than, that, under, the, kings, of, france, the, angevins, still, owed, homage, to, the, french, king, for, these, territories, from, the, 11th, century, the, angevins, had, autonomy, within, their, french, domains, neutralizing, the, issue, king, john, of, england, inherited, the, angevin, domains, from, his, brother, richard, i, however, philip, ii, of, france, acted, decisively, to, exploit, the, weaknesses, of, john, both, legally, and, militarily, and, by, 1204, had, succeeded, in, taking, control, of, much, of, the, angevin, continental, possessions, following, john, s, reign, the, battle, of, bouvines, 1214, the, saintonge, war, 1242, and, finally, the, war, of, saint, sardos, 1324, the, english, king, s, holdings, on, the, continent, as, duke, of, aquitaine, were, limited, roughly, to, provinces, in, gascony, the, dispute, over, guyenne, is, even, more, important, than, the, dynastic, question, in, explaining, the, outbreak, of, the, war, guyenne, posed, a, significant, problem, to, the, kings, of, france, and, england, edward, iii, was, a, vassal, of, philip, vi, of, france, because, of, his, french, possessions, and, was, required, to, recognize, the, suzerainty, of, the, king, of, france, over, them, in, practical, terms, a, judgment, in, guyenne, might, be, subject, to, an, appeal, to, the, french, royal, court, the, king, of, france, had, the, power, to, revoke, all, legal, decisions, made, by, the, king, of, england, in, aquitaine, which, was, unacceptable, to, the, english, therefore, sovereignty, over, guyenne, was, a, latent, conflict, between, the, two, monarchies, for, several, generations, during, the, war, of, saint, sardos, charles, of, valois, father, of, philip, vi, invaded, aquitaine, on, behalf, of, charles, iv, and, conquered, the, duchy, after, a, local, insurrection, which, the, french, believed, had, been, incited, by, edward, ii, of, england, charles, iv, grudgingly, agreed, to, return, this, territory, in, 1325, edward, ii, had, to, compromise, to, recover, his, duchy, he, sent, his, son, the, future, edward, iii, to, pay, homage, the, king, of, france, agreed, to, restore, guyenne, minus, agen, but, the, french, delayed, the, return, of, the, lands, which, helped, philip, vi, on, 6, june, 1329, edward, iii, finally, paid, homage, to, the, king, of, france, however, at, the, ceremony, philip, vi, had, it, recorded, that, the, homage, was, not, due, to, the, fiefs, detached, from, the, duchy, of, guyenne, by, charles, iv, especially, agen, for, edward, the, homage, did, not, imply, the, renunciation, of, his, claim, to, the, extorted, lands, in, the, 11th, century, gascony, in, southwest, france, had, been, incorporated, into, aquitaine, also, known, as, guyenne, or, guienne, and, formed, with, it, the, province, of, guyenne, and, gascony, french, guyenne, et, gascogne, the, angevin, kings, of, england, became, dukes, of, aquitaine, after, henry, ii, married, the, former, queen, of, france, eleanor, of, aquitaine, in, 1152, from, which, point, the, lands, were, held, in, vassalage, to, the, french, crown, by, the, 13th, century, the, terms, aquitaine, guyenne, and, gascony, were, virtually, synonymous, at, the, beginning, of, edward, iii, s, reign, on, 1, february, 1327, the, only, part, of, aquitaine, that, remained, in, his, hands, was, the, duchy, of, gascony, the, term, gascony, came, to, be, used, for, the, territory, held, by, the, angevin, plantagenet, kings, of, england, in, southwest, france, although, they, still, used, the, title, duke, of, aquitaine, for, the, first, 10, years, of, edward, iii, s, reign, gascony, had, been, a, significant, friction, point, the, english, argued, that, as, charles, iv, had, not, acted, properly, towards, his, tenant, edward, should, be, able, to, hold, the, duchy, free, of, french, suzerainty, the, french, rejected, this, argument, so, in, 1329, the, 17, year, old, edward, iii, paid, homage, to, philip, vi, tradition, demanded, that, vassals, approach, their, liege, unarmed, with, heads, bare, edward, protested, by, attending, the, ceremony, wearing, his, crown, and, sword, even, after, this, pledge, of, homage, the, french, continued, to, pressure, the, english, administration, gascony, was, not, the, only, sore, point, one, of, edward, s, influential, advisers, was, robert, iii, of, artois, robert, was, an, exile, from, the, french, court, having, fallen, out, with, philip, vi, over, an, inheritance, claim, he, urged, edward, to, start, a, war, to, reclaim, france, and, was, able, to, provide, extensive, intelligence, on, the, french, court, france, was, an, ally, of, the, kingdom, of, scotland, as, english, kings, had, tried, to, subjugate, the, country, for, some, time, in, 1295, a, treaty, was, signed, between, france, and, scotland, during, the, reign, of, philip, the, fair, known, as, the, auld, alliance, charles, iv, formally, renewed, the, treaty, in, 1326, promising, scotland, that, france, would, support, the, scots, if, england, invaded, their, country, similarly, france, would, have, scotland, s, support, if, its, own, kingdom, were, attacked, edward, could, not, succeed, in, his, plans, for, scotland, if, the, scots, could, count, on, french, support, philip, vi, had, assembled, a, large, naval, fleet, off, marseilles, as, part, of, an, ambitious, plan, for, a, crusade, to, the, holy, land, however, the, plan, was, abandoned, and, the, fleet, including, elements, of, the, scottish, navy, moved, to, the, english, channel, off, normandy, in, 1336, threatening, england, to, deal, with, this, crisis, edward, proposed, that, the, english, raise, two, armies, one, to, deal, with, the, scots, at, a, suitable, time, and, the, other, to, proceed, at, once, to, gascony, at, the, same, time, ambassadors, were, to, be, sent, to, france, with, a, proposed, treaty, for, the, french, king, at, the, end, of, april, 1337, philip, of, france, was, invited, to, meet, the, delegation, from, england, but, refused, the, arri, re, ban, a, call, to, arms, was, proclaimed, throughout, france, starting, on, 30, april, 1337, then, in, may, 1337, philip, met, with, his, great, council, in, paris, it, was, agreed, that, the, duchy, of, aquitaine, effectively, gascony, should, be, taken, back, into, the, king, s, hands, because, edward, iii, was, in, breach, of, his, obligations, as, a, vassal, and, had, sheltered, the, king, s, mortal, enemy, robert, d, artois, edward, responded, to, the, confiscation, of, aquitaine, by, challenging, philip, s, right, to, the, french, throne, when, charles, iv, died, edward, claimed, the, succession, of, the, french, throne, through, the, right, of, his, mother, isabella, charles, iv, s, sister, daughter, of, philip, iv, his, claim, was, considered, invalidated, by, edward, s, homage, to, philip, vi, in, 1329, edward, revived, his, claim, and, in, 1340, formally, assumed, the, title, king, of, france, and, the, french, royal, arms, on, 26, january, 1340, edward, iii, formally, received, homage, from, guy, half, brother, of, the, count, of, flanders, the, civic, authorities, of, ghent, ypres, and, bruges, proclaimed, edward, king, of, france, edward, aimed, to, strengthen, his, alliances, with, the, low, countries, his, supporters, could, claim, that, they, were, loyal, to, the, true, king, of, france, and, did, not, rebel, against, philip, in, february, 1340, edward, returned, to, england, to, try, to, raise, more, funds, and, also, deal, with, political, difficulties, relations, with, flanders, were, also, tied, to, the, english, wool, trade, since, flanders, principal, cities, relied, heavily, on, textile, production, and, england, supplied, much, of, the, raw, material, they, needed, edward, iii, had, commanded, that, his, chancellor, sit, on, the, woolsack, in, council, as, a, symbol, of, the, pre, eminence, of, the, wool, trade, at, the, time, there, were, about, 110, 000, sheep, in, sussex, alone, the, great, medieval, english, monasteries, produced, large, wool, surpluses, sold, to, mainland, europe, successive, governments, were, able, to, make, large, amounts, of, money, by, taxing, it, france, s, sea, power, led, to, economic, disruptions, for, england, shrinking, the, wool, trade, to, flanders, and, the, wine, trade, from, gascony, on, 22, june, 1340, edward, and, his, fleet, sailed, from, england, and, arrived, off, the, zwin, estuary, the, next, day, the, french, fleet, assumed, a, defensive, formation, off, the, port, of, sluis, the, english, fleet, deceived, the, french, into, believing, they, were, withdrawing, when, the, wind, turned, in, the, late, afternoon, the, english, attacked, with, the, wind, and, sun, behind, them, the, french, fleet, was, almost, destroyed, in, what, became, known, as, the, battle, of, sluys, england, dominated, the, english, channel, for, the, rest, of, the, war, preventing, french, invasions, at, this, point, edward, s, funds, ran, out, and, the, war, probably, would, have, ended, were, it, not, for, the, death, of, the, duke, of, brittany, in, 1341, precipitating, a, succession, dispute, between, the, duke, s, half, brother, john, of, montfort, and, charles, of, blois, nephew, of, philip, vi, in, 1341, this, inheritance, dispute, over, the, duchy, of, brittany, set, off, the, war, of, the, breton, succession, in, which, edward, backed, john, of, montfort, and, philip, backed, charles, of, blois, action, for, the, next, few, years, focused, on, a, back, and, forth, struggle, in, brittany, the, city, of, vannes, in, brittany, changed, hands, several, times, while, further, campaigns, in, gascony, met, with, mixed, success, for, both, sides, the, english, backed, montfort, finally, took, the, duchy, but, not, until, 1364, in, july, 1346, edward, mounted, a, major, invasion, across, the, channel, landing, on, normandy, s, cotentin, peninsula, at, st, vaast, the, english, army, captured, the, city, of, caen, in, just, one, day, surprising, the, french, philip, mustered, a, large, army, to, oppose, edward, who, chose, to, march, northward, toward, the, low, countries, pillaging, as, he, went, he, reached, the, river, seine, to, find, most, of, the, crossings, destroyed, he, moved, further, south, worryingly, close, to, paris, until, he, found, the, crossing, at, poissy, this, had, only, been, partially, destroyed, so, the, carpenters, within, his, army, were, able, to, fix, it, he, then, continued, to, flanders, until, he, reached, the, river, somme, the, army, crossed, at, a, tidal, ford, at, blanchetaque, stranding, philip, s, army, edward, assisted, by, this, head, start, continued, on, his, way, to, flanders, once, more, until, finding, himself, unable, to, outmaneuver, philip, edward, positioned, his, forces, for, battle, and, philip, s, army, attacked, the, battle, of, cr, cy, of, 1346, was, a, complete, disaster, for, the, french, largely, credited,

on, england, king, david, ii, of, scotland, responded, by, invading, northern, england, but, his, army, was, defeated, and, he, was, captured, at, the, battle, of, neville, s, cross, on, 17, october, 1346, this, greatly, reduced, the, threat, from, scotland, in, france, edward, proceeded, north, unopposed, and, besieged, the, city, of, calais, on, the, english, channel, capturing, it, in, 1347, this, became, an, important, strategic, asset, for, the, english, allowing, them, to, keep, troops, safely, in, northern, france, calais, would, remain, under, english, control, even, after, the, end, of, the, hundred, years, war, until, the, successful, french, siege, in, 1558, the, black, death, which, had, just, arrived, in, paris, in, 1348, ravaged, europe, in, 1355, after, the, plague, had, passed, and, england, was, able, to, recover, financially, king, edward, s, son, and, namesake, the, prince, of, wales, later, known, as, the, black, prince, led, a, chevauch, e, from, gascony, into, france, during, which, he, pillaged, avignonet, castelnaudary, carcassonne, and, narbonne, the, next, year, during, another, chevauch, e, he, ravaged, auvergne, limousin, and, berry, but, failed, to, take, bourges, he, offered, terms, of, peace, to, king, john, ii, of, france, known, as, john, the, good, who, had, outflanked, him, near, poitiers, but, refused, to, surrender, himself, as, the, price, of, their, acceptance, this, led, to, the, battle, of, poitiers, 19, september, 1356, where, the, black, prince, s, army, routed, the, french, during, the, battle, the, gascon, noble, jean, de, grailly, captal, de, buch, led, a, mounted, unit, that, was, concealed, in, a, forest, the, french, advance, was, contained, at, which, point, de, grailly, led, a, flanking, movement, with, his,

usefulness, and, profit, of, lord, and, men, they, subjected, and, despoiled, the, peasants, and, the, men, of, the, villages, in, no, wise, did, they, defend, their, country, from, its, enemies, rather, did, they, trample, it, underfoot, robbing, and, pillaging, the, peasants, goods, edward, invaded, france, for, the, third, and, last, time, hoping, to, capitalise, on, the, discontent, and, seize, the, throne, the, dauphin, s, strategy, was, that, of, non, engagement, with, the, english, army, in, the, field, however, edward, wanted, the, crown, and, chose, the, cathedral, city, of, reims, for, his, coronation, reims, was, the, traditional, coronation, city, however, the, citizens, of, reims, built, and, reinforced, the, city, s, defences, before, edward, and, his, army, arrived, edward, besieged, the, city, for, five, weeks, but, the, defences, held, and, there, was, no, coronation, edward, moved, on, to, paris, but, retreated, after, a, few, skirmishes, in, the, suburbs, next, was, the, town, of, chartres, disaster, struck, in, a, freak, hailstorm, on, the, encamped, army, causing, over, 1, 000, english, deaths, the, so, called, black, monday, at, easter, 1360, this, devastated, edward, s, army, and, forced, him, to, negotiate, when, approached, by, the, french, a, conference, was, held, at, br, tigny, that, resulted, in, the, treaty, of, br, tigny, 8, may, 1360, the, treaty, was, ratified, at, calais, in, october, in, return, for, increased, lands, in, aquitaine, edward, renounced, normandy, touraine, anjou, and, maine, and, consented, to, reduce, king, john, s, ransom, by, a, million, crowns, edward, also, abandoned, his, claim, to, the, crown, of, france, the, french, king, john, ii, was, held, captive, in, england, for, four, years, the, treaty, of, br, tigny, set, his, ransom, at, 3, million, crowns, and, allowed, for, hostages, to, be, held, in, lieu, of, john, the, hostages, included, two, of, his, sons, several, princes, and, nobles, four, inhabitants, of, paris, and, two, citizens, from, each, of, the, nineteen, principal, towns, of, france, while, these, hostages, were, held, john, returned, to, france, to, try, and, raise, funds, to,

captivity, in, england, the, french, crown, had, been, at, odds, with, navarre, near, southern, gascony, since, 1354, and, in, 1363, the, navarrese, used, the, captivity, of, john, ii, in, london, and, the, political, weakness, of, the, dauphin, to, try, to, seize, power, although, there, was, no, formal, treaty, edward, iii, supported, the, navarrese, moves, particularly, as, there, was, a, prospect, that, he, might, gain, control, over, the, northern, and, western, provinces, as, a, consequence, with, this, in, mind, edward, deliberately, slowed, the, peace, negotiations, in, 1364, john, ii, died, in, london, while, still, in, honourable, captivity, charles, v, succeeded, him, as, king, of, france, on, 16, may, one, month, after, the, dauphin, s, accession, and, three, days, before, his, coronation, as, charles, v, the, navarrese, suffered, a, crushing, defeat, at, the, battle, of, cocherel, in, 1366, there, was, a, civil, war, of, succession, in, castile, part, of,

provided, a, force, of, 12, 000, with, du, guesclin, at, their, head, to, support, trast, mara, in, his, invasion, of, castile, peter, appealed, to, england, and, aquitaine, s, black, prince, edward, of, woodstock, for, help, but, none, was, forthcoming, forcing, peter, into, exile, in, aquitaine, the, black, prince, had, previously, agreed, to, support, peter, s, claims, but, concerns, over, the, terms, of, the, treaty, of, br, tigny, led, him, to, assist, peter, as, a, representative, of, aquitaine, rather, than, england, he, then, led, an, anglo, gascon, army, into, castile, peter, was, restored, to, power, after, trast, mara, s, army, was, defeated, at, the, battle, of, n, jera, although, the, castilians, had, agreed, to, fund, the, black, prince, they, failed, to, do, so, the, prince, was, suffering, from, ill, health, and, returned, with, his, army, to, aquitaine, to, pay, off, debts, incurred, during, the, castile, campaign, the, prince, instituted, a, hearth, tax, arnaud, amanieu, viii, lord, of, albret, had, fought, on, the, black, prince, s, side, during, the, war, albret, who, already, had, become, discontented, by, the, influx, of, english, administrators, into, the, enlarged, aquitaine, refused, to, allow, the, tax, to, be, collected, in, his, fief, he, then, joined, a, group, of, gascon, lords, who, appealed, to, charles, v, for, support, in, their, refusal, to, pay, the, tax, charles, v, summoned, one, gascon, lord, and, the, black, prince, to, hear, the, case, in, his, high, court, in, paris, the, black, prince, answered, that, he, would, go,

force, of, 9, 000, men, from, calais, on, a, chevauch, e, while, initially, successful, as, french, forces, were, insufficiently, concentrated, to, oppose, them, the, english, met, more, resistance, as, they, moved, south, french, forces, began, to, concentrate, around, the, english, force, but, under, orders, from, charles, v, the, french, avoided, a, set, battle, instead, they, fell, on, forces, detached, from, the, main, body, to, raid, or, forage, the, french, shadowed, the, english, and, in, october, the, english, found, themselves, trapped, against, the, river, allier, by, four, french, forces, with, some, difficulty, the, english, crossed, at, the, bridge, at, moulins, but, lost, all, their, baggage, and, loot, the, english, carried, on, south, across, the, limousin, plateau, but, the, weather, was, turning, severe, men, and, horses, died, in, great, numbers, and, many, soldiers, forced, to, march, on, foot, discarded, their, armour, at, the, beginning, of, december, the, english, army, entered, friendly, territory, in, gascony, by, the, end, of, december, they, were, in, bordeaux, starving, ill, equipped, and, having, lost, over, half, of, the, 30, 000, horses, with, which, they, had, left, calais, although, the, march, across, france, had, been, a, remarkable, feat, it, was, a, military, failure, with, his, health, deteriorating, the, black, prince, returned, to, england, in, january, 1371, where, his, father, edward, iii, was, elderly, and, also, in, poor, health, the, prince, s, illness, was, debilitating, and, he, died, on, 8, june, 1376, edward, iii, died, the, following, year, on, 21, june, 1377, and, was, succeeded, by, the, black, prince, s, second, son, richard, ii, who, was, still, a, child, of, 10, edward, of, angoul, me, the, black, prince, s, first, son, had, died, sometime, earlier, the, treaty, of, br, tigny, had, left, edward, iii, and, england, with, enlarged, holdings, in, france, but, a, small, professional, french, army, under, the, leadership, of, du, guesclin, pushed, the, english, back, by, the, time, charles, v, died, in, 1380, the, english, held, only, calais, and, a, few, other, ports, it, was, usual, to, appoint, a, regent, in, the, case, of, a, child, monarch, but, no, regent, was, appointed, for, richard, ii, who, nominally, exercised, the, power, of, kingship, from, the, date, of, his, accession, in, 1377, between, 1377, and, 1380, actual, power, was, in, the, hands, of, a, series, of, councils, the, political, community, preferred, this, to, a, regency, led, by, the, king, s, uncle, john, of, gaunt, although, gaunt, remained, highly, influential, richard, faced, many, challenges, during, his, reign, including, the, peasants, revolt, led, by, wat, tyler, in, 1381, and, an, anglo, scottish, war, in, 1384, 1385, his, attempts, to, raise, taxes, to, pay, for, his, scottish, adventure, and, for, the, protection, of, calais, against, the, french, made, him, increasingly, unpopular, in, july, 1380, the, earl, of, buckingham, commanded, an, expedition, to, france, to, aid, england, s, ally, the, duke, of, brittany, the, french, refused, battle, before, the, walls, of, troyes, on, 25, august, buckingham, s, forces, continued, their, chevauch, e, and, in, november, laid, siege, to, nantes, the, support, expected, from, the, duke, of, brittany, did, not, appear, and, in, the, face, of, severe, losses, in, men, and, horses, buckingham, was, forced, to, abandon, the, siege, in, january, 1381, in, february, reconciled, to, the, regime, of, the, new, french, king, charles, vi, by, the, treaty, of, gu, rande, brittany, paid, 50, 000, francs, to, buckingham, for, him, to, abandon, the, siege, and, the, campaign, after, the, deaths, of, charles, v, and, du, guesclin, in, 1380, france, lost, its, main, leadership, and, overall, momentum, in, the, war, charles, vi, succeeded, his, father, as, king, of, france, at, the, age, of, 11, and, he, was, thus, put, under, a, regency, led, by, his, uncles, who, managed, to, maintain, an, effective, grip, on, government, affairs, until, about, 1388, well, after, charles, had, achieved, royal, majority, with, france, facing, widespread, destruction, plague, and, economic, recession, high, taxation, put, a, heavy, burden, on, the, french, peasantry, and, urban, communities, the, war, effort, against, england, largely, depended, on, royal, taxation, but, the, population, was, increasingly, unwilling, to, pay, for, it, as, would, be, demonstrated, at, the, harelle, and, maillotin, revolts, in, 1382, charles, v, had, abolished, many, of, these, taxes, on, his, deathbed, but, subsequent, attempts, to, reinstate, them, stirred, up, hostility, between, the, french, government, and, populace, philip, ii, of, burgundy, the, uncle, of, the, french, king, brought, together, a, burgundian, french, army, and, a, fleet, of, 1, 200, ships, near, the, zeeland, town, of, sluis, in, the, summer, and, autumn, of, 1386, to, attempt, an, invasion, of, england, but, this, venture, failed, however, philip, s, brother, john, of, berry, appeared, deliberately, late, so, that, the, autumn, weather, prevented, the, fleet, from, leaving, and, the, invading, army, then, dispersed, again, difficulties, in, raising, taxes, and, revenue, hampered, the, ability, of, the, french, to, fight, the, english, at, this, point, the, war, s, pace, had, largely, slowed, down, and, both, nations, found, themselves, fighting, mainly, through, proxy, wars, such, as, during, the, 1383, 1385, portuguese, interregnum, the, independence, party, in, the, kingdom, of, portugal, which, was, supported, by, the, english, won, against, the, supporters, of, the, king, of, castile, s, claim, to, the, portuguese, throne, who, in, turn, was, backed, by, the, french, the, war, became, increasingly, unpopular, with, the, english, public, due, to, the, high, taxes, needed, for, the, war, effort, these, taxes, were, seen, as, one, of, the, reasons, for, the, peasants, revolt, richard, ii, s, indifference, to, the, war, together, with, his, preferential, treatment, of, a, select, few, close, friends, and, advisors, angered, an, alliance, of, lords, that, included, one, of, his, uncles, this, group, known, as, lords, appellant, managed, to, press, charges, of, treason, against, five, of, richard, s, advisors, and, friends, in, the, merciless, parliament, the, lords, appellant, were, able, to, gain, control, of, the, council, in, 1388, but, failed, to, reignite, the, war, in, france, although, the, will, was, there, the, funds, to, pay, the, troops, was, lacking, so, in, the, autumn, of, 1388, the, council, agreed, to, resume, negotiations, with, the, french, crown, beginning, on, 18, june, 1389, with, the, signing, of, the, three, year, truce, of, leulinghem, in, 1389, richard, s, uncle, and, supporter, john, of, gaunt, returned, from, spain, and, richard, was, able, to, rebuild, his, power, gradually, until, 1397, when, he, reasserted, his, authority, and, destroyed, the, principal, three, among, the, lords, appellant, in, 1399, after, john, of, gaunt, died, richard, ii, disinherited, gaunt, s, son, the, exiled, henry, of, bolingbroke, bolingbroke, returned, to, england, with, his, supporters, deposed, richard, and, had, himself, crowned, henry, iv, in, scotland, the, problems, brought, in, by, the, english, regime, change, prompted, border, raids, that, were, countered, by, an, invasion, in, 1402, and, the, defeat, of, a, scottish, army, at, the, battle, of, homildon, hill, a, dispute, over, the, spoils, between, henry, and, henry, percy, 1st, earl, of, northumberland, resulted, in, a, long, and, bloody, struggle, between, the, two, for, control, of, northern, england, resolved, only, with, the, almost, complete, destruction, of, the, house, of, percy, by, 1408, in, wales, owain, glynd, r, was, declared, prince, of, wales, on, 16, september, 1400, he, was, the, leader, of, the, most, serious, and, widespread, rebellion, against, england, authority, in, wales, since, the, conquest, of, 1282, 1283, in, 1405, the, french, allied, with, glynd, r, and, the, castilians, in, spain, a, franco, welsh, army, advanced, as, far, as, worcester, while, the, spaniards, used, galleys, to, raid, and, burn, all, the, way, from, cornwall, to, southampton, before, taking, refuge, in, harfleur, for, the, winter, the, glynd, r, rising, was, finally, put, down, in, 1415, and, resulted, in, welsh, semi, independence, for, a, number, of, years, in, 1392, charles, vi, suddenly, descended, into, madness, forcing, france, into, a, regency, dominated, by, his, uncles, and, his, brother, a, conflict, for, control, over, the, regency, began, between, his, uncle, philip, the, bold, duke, of, burgundy, and, his, brother, louis, of, valois, duke, of, orl, ans, after, philip, s, death, his, son, and, heir, john, the, fearless, continued, the, struggle, against, louis, but, with, the, disadvantage, of, having, no, close, relation, to, the, king, finding, himself, outmanoeuvred, politically, john, ordered, the, assassination, of, louis, in, retaliation, his, involvement, in, the, murder, was, quickly, revealed, and, the, armagnac, family, took, political, power, in, opposition, to, john, by, 1410, both, sides, were, bidding, for, the, help, of, english, forces, in, a, civil, war, in, 1418, paris, was, taken, by, the, burgundians, who, were, unable, to, stop, the, massacre, of, count, of, armagnac, and, his, followers, by, a, parisian, crowd, with, an, estimated, death, toll, between, 1, 000, and, 5, 000, throughout, this, period, england, confronted, repeated, raids, by, pirates, that, damaged, trade, and, the, navy, there, is, some, evidence, that, henry, iv, used, state, legalised, piracy, as, a, form, of, warfare, in, the, english, channel, he, used, such, privateering, campaigns, to, pressure, enemies, without, risking, open, war, the, french, responded, in, kind, and, french, pirates, under, scottish, protection, raided, many, english, coastal, towns, the, domestic, and, dynastic, difficulties, faced, by, england, and, france, in, this, period, quieted, the, war, for, a, decade, henry, iv, died, in, 1413, and, was, replaced, by, his, eldest, son, henry, v, the, mental, illness, of, charles, vi, of, france, allowed, his, power, to, be, exercised, by, royal, princes, whose, rivalries, caused, deep, divisions, in, france, in, 1414, while, henry, held, court, at, leicester, he, received, ambassadors, from, burgundy, henry, accredited, envoys, to, the, french, king, to, make, clear, his, territorial, claims, in, france, he, also, demanded, the, hand, of, charles, vi, s, youngest, daughter, catherine, of, valois, the, french, rejected, his, demands, leading, henry, to, prepare, for, war, in, august, 1415, henry, v, sailed, from, england, with, a, force, of, about, 10, 500, and, laid, siege, to, harfleur, the, city, resisted, for, longer, than, expected, but, finally, surrendered, on, 22, september, because, of, the, unexpected, delay, most, of, the, campaign, season, was, gone, rather, than, march, on, paris, directly, henry, elected, to, make, a, raiding, expedition, across, france, toward, english, occupied, calais, in, a, campaign, reminiscent, of, cr, cy, he, found, himself, outmanoeuvred, and, low, on, supplies, and, had, to, fight, a, much, larger, french, army, at, the, battle, of, agincourt, north, of, the, somme, despite, the, problems, and, having, a, smaller, force, his, victory, was, near, total, the, french, defeat, was, catastrophic, costing, the, lives, of, many, of, the, armagnac, leaders, about, 40, of, the, french, nobility, was, killed, henry, was, apparently, concerned, that, the, large, number, of, prisoners, taken, were, a, security, risk, there, were, more, french, prisoners, than, there, were, soldiers, in, the, entire, english, army, and, he, ordered, their, deaths, before, the, french, reserves, fled, the, field, and, henry, rescinded, the, order, henry, retook, much, of, normandy, including, caen, in, 1417, and, rouen, on, 19, january, 1419, turning, normandy, english, for, the, first, time, in, two, centuries, a, formal, alliance, was, made, with, burgundy, which, had, taken, paris, in, 1418, before, the, assassination, of, duke, john, the, fearless, in, 1419, in, 1420, henry, met, with, king, charles, vi, they, signed, the, treaty, of, troyes, by, which, henry, finally, married, charles, daughter, catherine, of, valois, and, henry, s, heirs, would, inherit, the, throne, of, france, the, dauphin, charles, vii, was, declared, illegitimate, henry, formally, entered, paris, later, that, year, and, the, agreement, was, ratified, by, the, estates, general, french, les, tats, g, n, raux, on, 22, march, 1421, henry, v, s, progress, in, his, french, campaign, experienced, an, unexpected, reversal, henry, had, left, his, brother, and, presumptive, heir, thomas, duke, of, clarence, in, charge, while, he, returned, to, england, the, duke, of, clarence, engaged, a, franco, scottish, force, of, 5000, men, led, by, gilbert, motier, de, la, fayette, and, john, stewart, earl, of, buchan, at, the, battle, of, baug, the, duke, of, clarence, against, the, advice, of, his, lieutenants, before, his, army, had, been, fully, assembled, attacked, with, a, force, of, no, more, than, 1500, men, at, arms, then, during, the, course, of, the, battle, he, led, a, charge, of, a, few, hundred, men, into, the, main, body, of, the, franco, scottish, army, who, quickly, enveloped, the, english, in, the, ensuing, m, l, e, the, scot, john, carmichael, of, douglasdale, broke, his, lance, unhorsing, the, duke, of, clarence, once, on, the, ground, the, duke, was, slain, by, alexander, buchanan, the, body, of, the, duke, of, clarence, was, recovered, from, the, field, by, thomas, montacute, 4th, earl, of, salisbury, who, conducted, the, english, retreat, henry, v, returned, to, france, and, went, to, paris, then, visiting, chartres, and, g, tinais, before, returning, to, paris, from, there, he, decided, to, attack, the, dauphin, held, town, of, meaux, it, turned, out, to, be, more, difficult, to, overcome, than, first, thought, the, siege, began, about, 6, october, 1421, and, the, town, held, for, seven, months, before, finally, falling, on, 11, may, 1422, at, the, end, of, may, henry, was, joined, by, his, queen, and, together, with, the, french, court, they, went, to, rest, at, senlis, while, there, it, became, apparent, that, he, was, ill, possibly, dysentery, and, when, he, set, out, to, the, upper, loire, he, diverted, to, the, royal, castle, at, vincennes, near, paris, where, he, died, on, 31, august, the, elderly, and, insane,

of, his, archers, by, contrast, at, verneuil, the, archers, fought, to, devastating, effect, against, the, franco, scottish, army, the, effect, of, the, battle, was, to, virtually, destroy, the, dauphin, s, field, army, and, to, eliminate, the, scots, as, a, significant, military, force, for, the, rest, of, the, war, the, english, laid, siege, to, orl, ans, in, october, 1428, which, created, a, stalemate, for, months, food, shortages, within, the, city, led, to, the, likelihood, that, the, city, would, be, forced, to, surrender, in, april, 1429, joan, of, arc, persuaded, the, dauphin, to, send, her, to, the, siege, stating, she, had, received, visions, from, god, telling, her, to, drive, out, the, english, she, entered, the, city, on, april, 29, after, which, the, tide, began, to, turn, against, the, english, within, a, matter, of, days, she, raised, the, morale, of, the, troops, and, they, attacked, the, english, redoubts, forcing, the, english, to, lift, the, siege, inspired, by, joan, the, french, took, several, english, strongholds, on, the, loire, river, the, english, retreated, from, the, loire, valley, pursued, by, a, french, army, near, the, village, of, patay, french, cavalry, broke, through, a, unit, of, english, longbowmen, that, had, been, sent, to, block, the, road, then, swept, through, the, retreating, english, army, the, english, lost, 2, 200, men, and, the, commander, john, talbot, 1st, earl, of, shrewsbury, was, taken, prisoner, this, victory, opened, the, way, for, the, dauphin, to, march, to, reims, for, his, coronation, as, charles, vii, on, 16, july, 1429, after, the, coronation, charles, vii, s, army, fared, less, well, an, attempted, french, siege, of, paris, was, defeated, on, 8, september, 1429, and, charles, vii, withdrew, to, the, loire, valley, henry, vi, was, crowned, king, of, england, at, westminster, abbey, on, 5, november, 1429, and, king, of, france, at, notre, dame, in, paris, on, 16, december, 1431, joan, of, arc, was, captured, by, the, burgundians, at, the, siege, of, compi, gne, on, 23, may, 1430, the, burgundians, then, transferred, her, to, the, english, who, organised, a, trial, headed, by, pierre, cauchon, bishop, of, beauvais, and, a, collaborator, with, the, english, government, who, served, as, a, member, of, the, english, council, at, rouen, joan, was, convicted, and, burned, at, the, stake, on, 30, may, 1431, she, was, rehabilitated, 25, years, later, by, pope, callixtus, iii, after, the, death, of, joan, of, arc, the, fortunes, of, war, turned, dramatically, against, the, english, most, of, henry, s, royal, advisers, were, against, making, peace, among, the, factions, the, duke, of, bedford, wanted, to, defend, normandy, the, duke, of, gloucester, was, committed, to, just, calais, whereas, cardinal, beaufort, was, inclined, to, peace, negotiations, stalled, it, seems, that, at, the, congress, of, arras, in, the, summer, of, 1435, where, the, duke, of, beaufort, was, mediator, the, english, were, unrealistic, in, their, demands, a, few, days, after, the, congress, ended, in, september, philip, the, good, duke, of, burgundy, deserted, to, charles, vii, signing, the, treaty, of, arras, that, returned, paris, to, the, king, of, france, this, was, a, major, blow, to, english, sovereignty, in, france, the, duke, of, bedford, died, on, 14, september, 1435, and, was, later, replaced, by, richard, plantagenet, 3rd, duke, of, york, the, allegiance, of, burgundy, remained, fickle, but, the, burgundian, focus, on, expanding, their, domains, in, the, low, countries, left, them, little, energy, to, intervene, in, the, rest, of, france, the, long, truces, that, marked, the, war, gave, charles, time, to, centralise, the, french, state, and, reorganise, his, army, and, government, replacing, his, feudal, levies, with, a, more, modern, professional, army, that, could, put, its, superior, numbers, to, good, use, a, castle, that, once, could, only, be, captured, after, a, prolonged, siege, would, now, fall, after, a, few, days, from, cannon, bombardment, the, french, artillery, developed, a, reputation, as, the, best, in, the, world, by, 1449, the, french, had, retaken, rouen, in, 1450, the, count, of, clermont, and, arthur, de, richemont, earl, of, richmond, of, the, montfort, family, the, future, arthur, iii, duke, of, brittany, caught, an, english, army, attempting, to, relieve, caen, and, defeated, it, at, the, battle, of, formigny, in, 1450, richemont, s, force, attacked, the, english, army, from, the, flank, and, rear, just, as, they, were, on, the, verge, of, beating, clermont, s, army, after, charles, vii, s, successful, normandy, campaign, in, 1450, he, concentrated, his, efforts, on, gascony, the, last, province, held, by, the, english, bordeaux, gascony, s, capital, was, besieged, and, surrendered, to, the, french, on, 30, june, 1451, largely, due, to, the, english, sympathies, of, the, gascon, people, this, was, reversed, when, john, talbot, and, his, army, retook, the, city, on, 23, october, 1452, however, the, english, were, decisively, defeated, at, the, battle, of, castillon, on, 17, july, 1453, talbot, had, been, persuaded, to, engage, the, french, army, at, castillon, near, bordeaux, during, the, battle, the, french, appeared, to, retreat, towards, their, camp, the, french, camp, at, castillon, had, been, laid, out, by, charles, vii, s, ordinance, officer, jean, bureau, and, this, was, instrumental, in, the, french, success, as, when, the, french, cannon, opened, fire, from, their, positions, in, the, camp, the, english, took, severe, casualties, losing, both, talbot, and, his, son, although, the, battle, of, castillon, is, considered, the, last, battle, of, the, hundred, years, war, england, and, france, remained, formally, at, war, for, another, 20, years, but, the, english, were, in, no, position, to, carry, on, the, war, as, they, faced, unrest, at, home, bordeaux, fell, to, the, french, on, october, 19, and, there, were, no, more, hostilities, afterwards, following, defeat, in, the, hundred, years, war, english, landowners, complained, vociferously, about, the, financial, losses, resulting, from, the, loss, of, their, continental, holdings, this, is, often, considered, a, major, cause, of, the, wars, of, the, roses, that, started, in, 1455, the, hundred, years, war, almost, resumed, in, 1474, when, the, duke, charles, of, burgundy, counting, on, english, support, took, up, arms, against, louis, xi, louis, managed, to, isolate, the, burgundians, by, buying, edward, iv, of, england, off, with, a, large, cash, sum, and, an, annual, pension, in, the, treaty, of, picquigny, 1475, the, treaty, formally, ended, the, hundred, years, war, with, edward, renouncing, his, claim, to, the, throne, of, france, however, future, kings, of, england, and, later, of, great, britain, continued, to, claim, the, title, until, 1803, when, they, were, dropped, in, deference, to, the, exiled, count, of, provence, titular, king, louis, xviii, who, was, living, in, england, after, the, french, revolution, the, french, victory, marked, the, end, of, a, long, period, of, instability, that, had, been, seeded, with, the, norman, conquest, 1066, when, william, the, conqueror, added, king, of, england, to, his, titles, becoming, both, the, vassal, to, as, duke, of, normandy, and, the, equal, of, as, king, of, england, the, king, of, france, when, the, war, ended, england, was, bereft, of, its, continental, possessions, leaving, it, with, only, calais, on, the, continent, until, 1558, the, war, destroyed, the, english, dream, of, a, joint, monarchy, and, led, to, the, rejection, in, england, of, all, things, french, although, the, french, language, in, england, which, had, served, as, the, language, of, the, ruling, classes, and, commerce, there, from, the, time, of, the, norman, conquest, left, many, vestiges, in, english, vocabulary, english, became, the, official, language, in, 1362, and, french, was, no, longer, used, for, teaching, from, 1385, national, feeling, that, emerged, from, the, war, unified, both, france, and, england, further, despite, the, devastation, on, its, soil, the, hundred, years, war, accelerated, the, process, of, transforming, france, from, a, feudal, monarchy, to, a, centralised, state, in, england, the, political, and, financial, troubles, which, emerged, from, the, defeat, were, a, major, cause, of, the, war, of, the, roses, 1455, 1487, historian, ben, lowe, argued, in, 1997, that, opposition, to, the, war, helped, to, shape, england, s, early, modern, political, culture, although, anti, war, and, pro, peace, spokesmen, generally, failed, to, influence, outcomes, at, the, time, they, had, a, long, term, impact, england, showed, decreasing, enthusiasm, for, conflict, deemed, not, in, the, national, interest, yielding, only, losses, in, return, for, high, economic, burdens, in, comparing, this, english, cost, benefit, analysis, with, french, attitudes, given, that, both, countries, suffered, from, weak, leaders, and, undisciplined, soldiers, lowe, noted, that, the, french, understood, that, warfare, was, necessary, to, expel, the, foreigners, occupying, their, homeland, furthermore, french, kings, found, alternative, ways, to, finance, the, war, sales, taxes, debasing, the, coinage, and, were, less, dependent, than, the, english, on, tax, levies, passed, by, national, legislatures, english, anti, war, critics, thus, had, more, to, work, with, than, the, french, a, 2021, theory, about, the, early, formation, of, state, capacity, is, that, interstate, war, was, responsible, for, initiating, a, strong, move, toward, states, implementing, tax, systems, with, higher, state, capabilities, for, example, see, france, in, the, hundred, years, war, when, the, english, occupation, threatened, the, independent, french, kingdom, the, king, and, his, ruling, elite, demanded, consistent, and, permanent, taxation, which, would, allow, a, permanent, standing, army, to, be, financed, the, french, nobility, which, had, always, opposed, such, an, extension, of, state, capacity, agreed, in, this, exceptional, situation, hence, the, inter, state, war, with, england, increased, french, state, capability, bubonic, plague, and, warfare, reduced, population, numbers, throughout, europe, during, this, period, france, lost, half, its, population, during, the, hundred, years, war, with, normandy, reduced, by, three, quarters, and, paris, by, two, thirds, during, the, same, period, england, s, population, fell, by, 20, to, 33, per, cent, the, first, regular, standing, army, in, western, europe, since, roman, times, was, organised, in, france, in, 1445, partly, as, a, solution, to, marauding, free, companies, the, mercenary, companies, were, given, a, choice, of, either, joining, the, royal, army, as, compagnies, d, ordonnance, on, a, permanent, basis, or, being, hunted, down, and, destroyed, if, they, refused, france, gained, a, total, standing, army, of, around, 6, 000, men, which, was, sent, out, to, gradually, eliminate, the, remaining, mercenaries, who, insisted, on, operating, on, their, own, the, new, standing, army, had, a, more, disciplined, and, professional, approach, to, warfare, than, its, predecessors, the, hundred, years, war, was, a, time, of, rapid, military, evolution, weapons, tactics, army, structure, and, the, social, meaning, of, war, all, changed, partly, in, response, to, the, war, s, costs, partly, through, advancement, in, technology, and, partly, through, lessons, that, warfare, taught, the, feudal, system, slowly, disintegrated, as, well, as, the, concept, of, chivalry, by, the, war, s, end, although, the, heavy, cavalry, was, still, considered, the, most, powerful, unit, in, an, army, the, heavily, armoured, horse, had, to, deal, with, several, tactics, developed, to, deny, or, mitigate, its, effective, use, on, a, battlefield, the, english, began, using, lightly, armoured, mounted, troops, known, as, hobelars, hobelars, tactics, had, been, developed, against, the, scots, in, the, anglo, scottish, wars, of, the, 14th, century, hobelars, rode, smaller, unarmoured, horses, enabling, them, to, move, through, difficult, or, boggy, terrain, where, heavier, cavalry, would, struggle, rather, than, fight, while, seated, on, the, horse, they, would, dismount, to, engage, the, enemy, the, closing, battle, of, the, war, the, battle, of, castillon, was, the, first, major, battle, won, through, the, extensive, use, of, field, artillery
