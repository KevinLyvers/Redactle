the, kingdom, of, germany, or, german, kingdom, latin, regnum, teutonicorum, kingdom, of, the, germans, regnum, teutonicum, german, kingdom, regnum, alamanie, kingdom, of, germany, was, the, mostly, germanic, language, speaking, east, frankish, kingdom, which, was, formed, by, the, treaty, of, verdun, in, 843, the, king, was, elected, initially, by, the, rulers, of, the, stem, duchies, who, generally, chose, one, of, their, own, after, 962, when, otto, i, was, crowned, emperor, east, francia, formed, the, bulk, of, the, holy, roman, empire, which, also, included, the, kingdom, of, italy, and, after, 1032, the, kingdom, of, burgundy, like, medieval, england, and, medieval, france, medieval, germany, consolidated, from, a, conglomerate, of, smaller, tribes, nations, or, polities, by, the, high, middle, ages, the, term, rex, teutonicorum, king, of, the, germans, first, came, into, use, in, italy, around, the, year, 1000, it, was, popularized, by, the, chancery, of, pope, gregory, vii, during, the, investiture, controversy, late, 11th, century, perhaps, as, a, polemical, tool, against, emperor, henry, iv, in, the, 12th, century, in, order, to, stress, the, imperial, and, transnational, character, of, their, office, the, emperors, began, to, employ, the, title, rex, romanorum, king, of, the, romans, on, their, election, the, archbishop, of, mainz, was, ex, officio, arch, chancellor, of, germany, as, his, colleagues, the, archbishop, of, cologne, and, archbishop, of, trier, were, respectively, arch, chancellors, of, italy, and, burgundy, these, titles, continued, in, use, until, the, end, of, the, empire, but, only, the, german, chancery, actually, existed, distinct, titulature, for, germany, italy, and, burgundy, which, traditionally, had, their, own, courts, laws, and, chanceries, gradually, dropped, from, use, as, the, king, emperor, s, influence, outside, of, germany, waned, and, the, german, kingdom, came, to, be, identified, with, the, holy, roman, empire, reigns, were, either, dated, from, the, day, a, ruler, was, elected, king, philip, of, swabia, rudolf, of, habsburg, or, crowned, king, otto, iv, henry, vii, louis, iv, charles, iv, the, election, day, became, the, starting, date, permanently, with, sigismund, throughout, the, middle, ages, the, king, of, germany, was, known, as, king, of, the, romans, from, his, election, as, king, until, the, pope, crowned, him, emperor, in, rome, the, tripartite, division, of, the, carolingian, empire, effected, by, the, treaty, of, verdun, was, challenged, very, early, on, with, the, death, of, the, emperor, lothair, i, in, 855, he, had, divided, his, kingdom, of, middle, francia, between, his, three, sons, and, immediately, the, northernmost, of, the, three, divisions, lotharingia, was, disputed, between, the, kings, of, east, and, west, francia, the, war, over, lotharingia, lasted, until, 925, lothair, ii, of, lotharingia, died, in, 869, and, the, 870, treaty, of, meerssen, divided, his, kingdom, between, east, and, west, francia, but, the, west, frankish, sovereigns, relinquished, their, rightful, portion, to, east, francia, by, the, treaty, of, ribemont, in, 880, ribemont, determined, the, border, between, france, and, germany, until, the, fourteenth, century, the, lotharingian, nobility, tried, to, preserve, their, independence, of, east, or, west, frankish, rule, by, switching, allegiance, at, will, with, the, death, of, king, louis, the, child, in, 911, but, in, 925, lotharingia, was, finally, ceded, to, east, francia, by, rudolph, of, west, francia, and, it, thereafter, formed, the, duchy, of, lorraine, within, the, east, frankish, kingdom, louis, the, german, was, known, at, the, time, as, rex, germaniae, king, of, germany, as, his, brother, was, called, king, of, gaul, this, was, meant, to, distinguish, the, different, parts, of, a, theoretically, single, frankish, kingdom, although, it, is, not, known, if, this, was, meant, to, signify, anything, further, east, francia, was, itself, divided, into, three, parts, at, the, death, of, louis, the, german, 875, traditionally, referred, to, as, saxony, bavaria, and, swabia, or, alemannia, these, kingdoms, were, ruled, by, the, three, sons, of, louis, in, cooperation, and, were, reunited, by, charles, the, fat, in, 882, regional, differences, existed, between, the, peoples, of, the, different, regions, of, the, kingdom, and, each, region, could, be, readily, described, by, contemporaries, as, a, regnum, though, each, was, certainly, not, a, kingdom, of, its, own, the, common, germanic, language, and, the, tradition, of, common, rule, dating, to, 843, preserved, political, ties, between, the, different, regna, and, prevented, the, kingdom, from, coming, apart, after, the, death, of, charles, the, fat, the, work, of, louis, the, german, to, maintain, his, kingdom, and, give, it, a, strong, royal, government, also, went, a, long, way, to, creating, an, east, frankish, i, e, german, state, within, east, francia, were, large, duchies, sometimes, called, kingdoms, regna, after, their, former, status, which, had, a, certain, level, of, internal, solidarity, early, among, these, were, saxony, and, bavaria, which, had, been, conquered, by, charlemagne, in, german, historiography, they, are, called, the, j, ngere, stammesherzogt, mer, or, younger, stem, duchies, the, conventional, five, younger, stem, duchies, of, the, holy, roman, empire, are, saxony, bavaria, franconia, swabia, and, lotharingia, thuringia, while, one, of, the, old, stem, duchies, is, not, counted, among, the, young, stem, duchies, because, it, had, been, absorbed, into, saxony, in, 908, before, the, foundation, of, the, holy, roman, empire, the, conventional, term, younger, serves, to, distinguish, them, from, the, poorly, documented, duchies, under, the, merovingian, monarchs, herwig, wolfram, 1971, denied, any, real, distinction, between, older, and, younger, stem, duchies, or, between, the, stem, duchies, of, germany, and, similar, territorial, principalities, in, other, parts, of, the, carolingian, empire, i, am, attempting, to, refute, the, whole, hallowed, doctrine, of, the, difference, between, the, beginnings, of, the, west, frankish, french, principaut, s, territoriales, and, the, east, frankish, german, stem, duchies, certainly, their, names, had, already, appeared, during, the, migrations, yet, their, political, institutional, and, biological, structures, had, more, often, than, not, thoroughly, changed, i, have, moreover, refuted, the, basic, difference, between, the, so, called, lteres, stammesf, rstentum, and, j, ngeres, stammesf, rstentum, since, i, consider, the, duchies, before, and, after, charlemagne, to, have, been, basically, the, same, frankish, institution, there, has, been, debate, in, modern, german, historiography, over, the, sense, in, which, these, duchies, were, tribal, as, in, a, people, sharing, a, common, descent, stem, being, governed, as, units, over, long, periods, of, time, sharing, a, tribal, sense, of, solidarity, shared, customs, etc, in, the, context, of, modern, german, nationalism, gerd, tellenbach, 1939, emphasised, the, role, of, feudalism, both, of, the, kings, in, the, formation, of, the, german, kingdom, and, of, the, dukes, in, the, formation, of, the, stem, duchies, against, martin, lintzel, and, walter, schlesinger, who, emphasised, the, role, of, the, individual, stems, or, tribes, st, mme, the, existence, of, a, tribal, self, designation, among, saxons, and, bavarians, can, be, asserted, for, the, 10th, and, 12th, centuries, respectively, although, they, may, have, existed, much, earlier, after, the, death, of, the, last, carolingian, louis, the, child, in, 911, the, stem, duchies, acknowledged, the, unity, of, the, kingdom, the, dukes, gathered, and, elected, conrad, i, to, be, their, king, according, to, tellenbach, s, thesis, the, dukes, created, the, duchies, during, conrad, s, reign, no, duke, attempted, to, set, up, an, independent, kingdom, even, after, the, death, of, conrad, in, 918, when, the, election, of, henry, the, fowler, was, disputed, his, rival, arnulf, duke, of, bavaria, did, not, establish, a, separate, kingdom, but, claimed, the, whole, before, being, forced, by, henry, to, submit, to, royal, authority, henry, may, even, have, promulgated, a, law, stipulating, that, the, kingdom, would, thereafter, be, united, arnulf, continued, to, rule, it, like, a, king, even, after, his, submission, but, after, his, death, in, 937, it, was, quickly, brought, under, royal, control, by, henry, s, son, otto, the, great, the, ottonians, worked, to, preserve, the, duchies, as, offices, of, the, crown, but, by, the, reign, of, henry, iv, the, dukes, had, made, them, functionally, hereditary, the, eastern, division, of, the, treaty, of, verdun, was, called, the, regnum, francorum, orientalium, or, francia, orientalis, the, kingdom, of, the, eastern, franks, or, simply, east, francia, it, was, the, eastern, half, of, the, old, merovingian, regnum, austrasiorum, the, east, franks, or, austrasians, themselves, were, the, people, of, franconia, which, had, been, settled, by, franks, the, other, peoples, of, east, francia, were, saxons, frisians, thuringii, and, the, like, referred, to, as, teutonici, or, germans, and, sometimes, as, franks, as, ethnic, identities, changed, over, the, course, of, the, ninth, century, an, entry, in, the, annales, iuvavenses, or, salzburg, annals, for, the, year, 919, roughly, contemporary, but, surviving, only, in, a, twelfth, century, copy, records, that, baiuarii, sponte, se, reddiderunt, arnolfo, duci, et, regnare, ei, fecerunt, in, regno, teutonicorum, i, e, that, arnulf, duke, of, the, bavarians, was, elected, to, reign, in, the, kingdom, of, the, germans, historians, disagree, on, whether, this, text, is, what, was, written, in, the, lost, original, also, on, the, wider, issue, whether, the, idea, of, the, kingdom, as, german, rather, than, frankish, dates, from, the, tenth, or, the, eleventh, century, but, the, idea, of, the, kingdom, as, german, is, firmly, established, by, the, end, of, the, eleventh, century, in, the, tenth, century, german, writers, already, tended, toward, using, modified, terms, such, as, francia, and, saxony, or, land, of, the, teutons, any, firm, distinction, between, the, kingdoms, of, eastern, francia, and, germany, is, to, some, extent, the, product, of, later, retrospection, it, is, impossible, to, base, this, distinction, on, primary, sources, as, eastern, francia, remains, in, use, long, after, kingdom, of, germany, comes, into, use, the, 12th, century, imperial, historian, otto, von, freising, reported, that, the, election, of, henry, the, fowler, was, regarded, as, marking, the, beginning, of, the, kingdom, though, otto, himself, disagreed, with, this, thus, from, this, point, some, reckon, a, kingdom, of, the, germans, as, supplanting, that, of, the, franks, hence, they, say, that, pope, leo, in, the, decrees, of, the, popes, called, henry, s, son, otto, the, first, king, of, the, germans, for, that, henry, of, whom, we, are, speaking, refused, it, is, said, the, honor, offered, by, the, supreme, pontiff, but, it, seems, to, me, that, the, kingdom, of, the, germans, which, today, as, we, see, has, possession, of, rome, is, a, part, of, the, kingdom, of, the, franks, for, as, is, perfectly, clear, in, what, precedes, at, the, time, of, charles, the, boundaries, of, the, kingdom, of, the, franks, included, the, whole, of, gaul, and, all, germany, from, the, rhine, to, illyricum, when, the, realm, was, divided, between, his, son, s, sons, one, part, was, called, eastern, the, other, western, yet, both, together, were, called, the, kingdom, of, the, franks, so, then, in, the, eastern, part, which, is, called, the, kingdom, of, the, germans, henry, was, the, first, of, the, race, of, saxons, to, succeed, to, the, throne, when, the, line, of, charles, failed, henry, s, son, otto, because, he, restored, to, the, german, east, franks, the, empire, which, had, been, usurped, by, the, lombards, is, called, the, first, king, of, the, germans, not, perhaps, because, he, was, the, first, king, to, reign, among, the, germans, it, is, here, and, elsewhere, that, otto, distinguishes, the, first, german, king, henry, i, and, the, first, german, king, to, hold, imperial, power, otto, i, henry, ii, r, 1002, 1024, was, the, first, to, be, called, king, of, the, germans, rex, teutonicorum, the, ottonians, seem, to, have, adopted, the, use, of, the, teutonic, label, as, it, helped, them, to, counter, critics, who, questioned, how, the, ottonians, who, were, neither, carolingian, nor, frankish, could, legitimately, rule, the, ottonians, by, calling, themselves, german, kings, instead, presented, themselves, as, rulers, of, all, peoples, north, of, the, alps, and, east, of, the, rhine, this, german, kingdom, was, later, regarded, as, a, subdivision, of, the, empire, alongside, italy, burgundy, and, bohemia, in, the, late, eleventh, century, the, term, kingdom, of, the, germans, regnum, teutonicorum, had, become, utilised, more, favourably, in, germany, due, to, a, growing, sense, of, national, identity, by, the, twelfth, century, german, historian, otto, of, freising, had, to, explain, that, east, francia, was, now, called, the, kingdom, of, the, germans, in, 1028, after, his, coronation, as, emperor, in, 1027, conrad, ii, had, his, son, henry, iii, elected, king, by, the, prince, electors, when, in, 1035, conrad, attempted, to, depose, adalbero, duke, of, carinthia, henry, acting, on, the, advice, of, his, tutor, egilbert, bishop, of, freising, refused, to, allow, it, as, adalbero, was, a, vassal, of, the, king, not, the, emperor, the, german, magnates, having, legally, elected, henry, would, not, recognise, the, deposition, unless, their, king, did, also, after, many, angry, protests, conrad, finally, knelt, before, his, son, and, pleaded, for, his, desired, consent, which, was, finally, given, however, conrad, ii, used, the, simple, title, king, or, on, occasion, king, of, the, franks, and, lombards, before, imperial, coronation, while, his, son, henry, iii, introduced, the, title, king, of, the, romans, before, the, imperial, coronation, his, grandson, henry, iv, used, both, king, of, the, franks, and, lombards, and, king, of, the, romans, before, imperial, coronation, beginning, in, the, late, eleventh, century, during, the, investiture, controversy, the, papal, curia, began, to, use, the, term, regnum, teutonicorum, to, refer, to, the, realm, of, henry, iv, in, an, effort, to, reduce, him, to, the, level, of, the, other, kings, of, europe, while, he, himself, began, to, use, the, title, rex, romanorum, or, king, of, the, romans, to, emphasise, his, divine, right, to, the, imperium, romanum, this, title, was, employed, most, frequently, by, the, german, kings, themselves, though, they, did, deign, to, employ, teutonic, titles, when, it, was, diplomatic, such, as, frederick, barbarossa, s, letter, referring, to, his, receiving, the, coronam, theutonici, regni, crown, of, the, german, kingdom, foreign, kings, and, ecclesiastics, continued, to, refer, to, the, regnum, alemanniae, and, r, gne, or, royaume, d, allemagne, the, terms, imperium, imperator, or, empire, emperor, were, often, employed, for, the, german, kingdom, and, its, rulers, which, indicates, a, recognition, of, their, imperial, stature, however, foreign, sources, combined, the, imperial, titles, with, teutonic, and, alemannic, which, reference, a, denial, of, their, romanitas, or, universal, rule, the, term, regnum, germaniae, begins, to, appear, even, in, german, sources, at, the, beginning, of, the, fourteenth, century, during, the, celebrations, on, the, canonisation, of, charlemagne, in, december, 1165, and, january, 1166, barbarossa, also, called, aachen, the, head, and, seat, of, the, german, kingdom, when, pope, gregory, vii, started, using, the, term, regnum, teutonicorum, the, concept, of, a, distinct, territorial, kingdom, separate, from, kingdom, of, italy, was, already, widely, recognised, on, both, sides, of, the, alps, and, this, entity, was, at, least, externally, perceived, as, german, in, nature, contemporary, writers, representing, various, german, vassal, rulers, also, adopted, this, terminology, under, papal, influence, in, the, papal, imperial, concordat, of, worms, of, 1122, which, put, an, end, to, the, investiture, controversy, the, authority, of, the, emperor, regarding, church, offices, in, this, german, kingdom, was, legally, distinguished, from, his, authority, in, other, parts, of, the, empire, the, imperial, chancery, did, adopt, the, german, titles, albeit, inconsistently, pope, gregory, began, using, the, term, regnum, teutonicorum, even, before, his, conflict, with, henry, iv, he, was, highly, successful, at, encouraging, his, german, supporters, such, as, berthold, of, reichenau, or, bernold, of, st, blasien, to, use, the, terms, regnum, teutonicorum, or, teutonicae, partes, prior, to, the, civil, wars, of, henry, iv, and, the, letters, of, pope, gregory, vii, which, address, the, german, people, as, a, whole, the, loyalties, of, germans, were, primarily, focused, on, local, regions, such, as, bavaria, swabia, franconia, upper, or, lower, lotharingia, east, or, west, saxony, only, from, the, mid, 1070s, was, there, a, common, political, awareness, of, a, german, kingdom, as, a, single, unit, of, political, loyalty, in, the, 13th, century, the, term, regnum, teutonicorum, started, being, replaced, in, germany, by, the, similar, regnum, alemanniae, possibly, due, to, french, or, papal, influence, or, alternatively, due, to, the, staufer, emperors, base, of, power, in, the, duchy, of, swabia, also, known, as, alamannia, emperor, frederick, ii, even, proclaimed, his, son, henry, vii, as, rex, alemannie, king, of, germany, to, rule, germany, under, him, while, he, ruled, the, rest, of, the, empire, the, kaiserchronik, explicitly, describes, henry, as, having, rule, of, a, separate, german, kingdom, siniu, tiuschen, riche, under, the, empire, henry, s, successor, konrad, iv, was, also, called, king, designate, of, germany, rex, theutonie, designatus, by, a, contemporary, writer, the, count, palatine, of, the, rhine, was, legally, authorised, to, judge, on, the, princes, affairs, should, the, king, leave, germany, von, teutchem, lande, in, the, sachsenspiegel, and, schwabenspiegel, of, the, medieval, german, law, the, vassal, princes, were, only, required, to, provide, service, to, the, empire, and, attend, court, within, the, german, lands, frederick, ii, or, his, successors, were, unable, to, call, upon, the, german, lords, to, bohemia, italy, or, their, other, domains, royal, and, imperial, legislation, were, sometimes, specifically, binding, only, within, the, borders, of, germany, excluding, the, rest, of, the, empire, german, writers, after, the, staufen, period, used, variants, of, the, term, regnum, alemanniae, to, indicate, the, weakened, reach, of, the, emperors, who, now, confined, themselves, mainly, to, german, matters, anti, king, henry, raspe, also, described, himself, as, king, of, germany, and, prince, of, the, romans, there, were, also, scattered, references, to, a, political, community, of, germans, excluding, the, rest, of, the, empire, for, instance, in, 1349, charles, iv, met, the, nobles, and, burghers, of, regnum, alamannie, in, 1355, he, summoned, the, electors, and, burghers, in, regno, alemannie, however, this, tendency, to, refer, to, a, german, polity, after, the, collapse, of, the, staufen, empire, did, not, develop, further, in, the, following, period, the, term, regnum, was, sometimes, used, to, refer, a, distinct, political, entity, within, the, imperium, but, sometimes, they, were, used, interchangeably, and, sometimes, they, were, combined, in, phrases, like, regnum, romanorum, in, the, german, language, it, was, most, common, to, simply, use, the, term, german, lands, rather, than, kingdom, in, 1349, charles, iv, king, of, the, romans, appointed, the, duke, of, brabant, s, son, to, govern, on, his, behalf, in, our, kingdom, of, the, romans, throughout, germania, or, theutonia, there, were, persistent, proposals, including, one, that, ptolemy, of, lucca, claimed, was, discussed, between, pope, nicholas, iii, and, rudolf, i, to, create, a, hereditary, german, kingdom, independent, from, the, holy, empire, this, idea, was, met, with, horror, in, germany, when, rudolf, i, was, elected, the, emotional, attachment, the, german, people, had, with, the, superior, dignity, of, the, universalistic, roman, title, had, become, so, firmly, established, that, it, was, unacceptable, to, separate, the, german, kingship, from, it, there, was, a, strong, reluctance, by, the, emperors, to, use, german, titles, due, to, strong, attachment, to, roman, symbolism, and, it, seemed, to, be, actively, avoided, references, to, german, titles, were, less, rare, but, still, uncommon, among, vassals, and, chroniclers, from, 1250, onward, the, association, between, germans, and, the, whole, empire, became, stronger, as, post, staufer, german, monarchs, were, too, weak, to, secure, coronation, as, emperor, german, writers, became, concerned, that, germany, was, losing, the, prestige, of, imperial, status, the, lack, of, concentration, of, power, in, one, ruler, or, region, also, made, the, monarchy, more, attractive, to, all, germans, these, led, to, more, interest, in, connecting, german, identity, to, being, heirs, of, imperial, rome, translatio, imperii, by, right, of, their, military, strength, as, defenders, of, christendom, at, the, same, time, the, replacement, of, latin, with, german, in, official, documents, entrenched, the, german, character, of, the, empire, at, large, in, 1474, the, term, holy, roman, empire, of, the, german, nation, appeared, becoming, more, common, after, 1512, however, even, after, 1560, only, 1, in, 9, official, documents, mention, germany, and, most, omitted, the, rest, as, well, and, simply, called, it, the, empire, in, 1544, the, cosmographia, sebastian, m, nster, was, published, which, used, germany, te, tschland, as, synonymous, with, the, empire, as, a, whole, johann, jacob, moser, also, used, german, as, a, synonym, for, imperial, this, conflated, definition, of, german, even, included, non, german, speakers, in, 1508, maximilian, i, with, papal, approval, adopted, the, title, emperor, elect, dei, gratia, romanorum, imperator, electus, semper, augustus, subsequent, rulers, adopted, that, title, after, their, coronation, as, kings, at, the, same, time, the, custom, of, having, the, heir, apparent, elected, as, king, of, the, romans, in, the, emperor, s, lifetime, resumed, for, this, reason, the, title, king, of, the, romans, rex, romanorum, came, to, mean, heir, apparent, the, successor, elected, while, the, emperor, was, still, alive, after, the, imperial, reform, and, reformation, settlement, the, german, part, of, the, holy, roman, empire, was, divided, into, reichskreise, imperial, circles, which, in, effect, defined, germany, against, imperial, territories, outside, the, imperial, circles, imperial, italy, the, crown, of, bohemia, and, the, old, swiss, confederacy, brendan, simms, called, the, imperial, circles, as, an, embryonic, german, collective, security, system, and, a, potential, vehicle, for, national, unity, against, outsiders, nevertheless, there, are, relatively, few, references, to, a, german, kingdom, distinct, from, the, holy, roman, empire
