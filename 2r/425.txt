christianity, protestantism, the, huguenots, h, ju, n, t, s, hew, g, nots, uk, also, n, o, z, nohz, french, were, a, religious, group, of, french, protestants, who, held, to, the, reformed, calvinist, tradition, of, protestantism, the, term, which, may, be, derived, from, the, name, of, a, swiss, political, leader, the, genevan, burgomaster, besan, on, hugues, 1491, 1532, was, in, common, use, by, the, mid, 16th, century, huguenot, was, frequently, used, in, reference, to, those, of, the, reformed, church, of, france, from, the, time, of, the, protestant, reformation, by, contrast, the, protestant, populations, of, eastern, france, in, alsace, moselle, and, montb, liard, were, mainly, lutherans, in, his, encyclopedia, of, protestantism, hans, hillerbrand, wrote, that, on, the, eve, of, the, st, bartholomew, s, day, massacre, in, 1572, the, huguenot, community, made, up, as, much, as, 10, of, the, french, population, by, 1600, it, had, declined, to, 7, 8, and, was, reduced, further, late, in, the, century, after, the, return, of, persecution, under, louis, xiv, who, instituted, the, dragonnades, to, forcibly, convert, protestants, and, then, finally, revoked, all, protestant, rights, in, his, edict, of, fontainebleau, of, 1685, the, huguenots, were, concentrated, in, the, southern, and, western, parts, of, the, kingdom, of, france, as, huguenots, gained, influence, and, more, openly, displayed, their, faith, catholic, hostility, grew, a, series, of, religious, conflicts, followed, known, as, the, french, wars, of, religion, fought, intermittently, from, 1562, to, 1598, the, huguenots, were, led, by, jeanne, d, albret, her, son, the, future, henry, iv, who, would, later, convert, to, catholicism, in, order, to, become, king, and, the, princes, of, cond, the, wars, ended, with, the, edict, of, nantes, of, 1598, which, granted, the, huguenots, substantial, religious, political, and, military, autonomy, huguenot, rebellions, in, the, 1620s, resulted, in, the, abolition, of, their, political, and, military, privileges, they, retained, the, religious, provisions, of, the, edict, of, nantes, until, the, rule, of, louis, xiv, who, gradually, increased, persecution, of, protestantism, until, he, issued, the, edict, of, fontainebleau, 1685, this, ended, legal, recognition, of, protestantism, in, france, and, the, huguenots, were, forced, to, either, convert, to, catholicism, possibly, as, nicodemites, or, flee, as, refugees, they, were, subject, to, violent, dragonnades, louis, xiv, claimed, that, the, french, huguenot, population, was, reduced, from, about, 900, 000, or, 800, 000, adherents, to, just, 1, 000, or, 1, 500, he, exaggerated, the, decline, but, the, dragonnades, were, devastating, for, the, french, protestant, community, the, exodus, of, huguenots, from, france, created, a, brain, drain, as, many, of, them, had, occupied, important, places, in, society, the, remaining, huguenots, faced, continued, persecution, under, louis, xv, by, the, time, of, his, death, in, 1774, calvinism, had, been, all, but, eliminated, from, france, persecution, of, protestants, officially, ended, with, the, edict, of, versailles, signed, by, louis, xvi, in, 1787, two, years, later, with, the, revolutionary, declaration, of, the, rights, of, man, and, of, the, citizen, of, 1789, protestants, gained, equal, rights, as, citizens, a, term, used, originally, in, derision, huguenot, has, unclear, origins, various, hypotheses, have, been, promoted, the, term, may, have, been, a, combined, reference, to, the, swiss, politician, besan, on, hugues, died, 1532, and, the, religiously, conflicted, nature, of, swiss, republicanism, in, his, time, it, used, a, derogatory, pun, on, the, name, hugues, by, way, of, the, dutch, word, huisgenoten, literally, housemates, referring, to, the, connotations, of, a, somewhat, related, word, in, german, eidgenosse, confederate, in, the, sense, of, a, citizen, of, one, of, the, states, of, the, swiss, confederacy, geneva, was, john, calvin, s, adopted, home, and, the, centre, of, the, calvinist, movement, in, geneva, hugues, though, catholic, was, a, leader, of, the, confederate, party, so, called, because, it, favoured, independence, from, the, duke, of, savoy, it, sought, an, alliance, between, the, city, state, of, geneva, and, the, swiss, confederation, the, label, huguenot, was, purportedly, first, applied, in, france, to, those, conspirators, all, of, them, aristocratic, members, of, the, reformed, church, who, were, involved, in, the, amboise, plot, of, 1560, a, foiled, attempt, to, wrest, power, in, france, from, the, influential, and, zealously, catholic, house, of, guise, this, action, would, have, fostered, relations, with, the, swiss, o, i, a, roche, promoted, this, idea, among, historians, he, wrote, in, his, book, the, days, of, the, upright, a, history, of, the, huguenots, 1965, that, huguenot, is, a, combination, of, a, dutch, and, a, german, word, in, the, dutch, speaking, north, of, france, bible, students, who, gathered, in, each, other, s, houses, to, study, secretly, were, called, huis, genooten, housemates, while, on, the, swiss, and, german, borders, they, were, termed, eid, genossen, or, oath, fellows, that, is, persons, bound, to, each, other, by, an, oath, gallicised, into, huguenot, often, used, deprecatingly, the, word, became, during, two, and, a, half, centuries, of, terror, and, triumph, a, badge, of, enduring, honour, and, courage, some, disagree, with, such, non, french, linguistic, origins, janet, gray, argues, that, for, the, word, to, have, spread, into, common, use, in, france, it, must, have, originated, there, in, french, the, hugues, hypothesis, argues, that, the, name, was, derived, by, association, with, hugues, capet, king, of, france, who, reigned, long, before, the, reformation, he, was, regarded, by, the, gallicians, as, a, noble, man, who, respected, people, s, dignity, and, lives, janet, gray, and, other, supporters, of, the, hypothesis, suggest, that, the, name, huguenote, would, be, roughly, equivalent, to, little, hugos, or, those, who, want, hugo, paul, ristelhuber, in, his, 1879, introduction, to, a, new, edition, of, the, controversial, and, censored, but, popular, 1566, work, apologie, pour, h, rodote, by, henri, estienne, mentions, these, theories, and, opinions, but, tends, to, support, a, completely, catholic, origin, as, one, legend, holds, a, gateway, area, in, the, streets, of, tours, was, haunted, by, the, ghosts, of, le, roi, huguet, a, generic, term, for, these, spirits, because, they, were, wont, to, assemble, near, the, gate, named, after, hugon, a, count, of, tours, in, ancient, times, who, had, left, a, record, of, evil, deeds, and, had, become, in, popular, fancy, a, sort, of, sinister, and, maleficent, genius, this, count, may, have, been, hugh, of, tours, who, was, disliked, for, his, cowardice, additionally, it, is, related, that, it, was, believed, that, of, these, spirits, instead, of, spending, their, time, in, purgatory, came, back, to, rattle, doors, and, haunt, and, harm, people, at, night, protestants, went, out, at, nights, to, their, lascivious, conventicles, and, so, the, priests, and, the, people, began, to, call, them, huguenots, in, tours, and, then, elsewhere, the, name, huguenot, the, people, applied, in, hatred, and, derision, to, those, who, were, elsewhere, called, lutherans, and, from, touraine, it, spread, throughout, france, the, pr, tendus, r, form, s, supposedly, reformed, were, said, to, gather, at, night, at, tours, both, for, political, purposes, and, for, prayer, and, singing, psalms, reguier, de, la, plancha, d, 1560, in, his, de, l, estat, de, france, offered, the, following, account, as, to, the, origin, of, the, name, as, cited, by, the, cape, monthly, reguier, de, la, plancha, accounts, for, it, as, follows, the, name, huguenand, was, given, to, those, of, the, religion, during, the, affair, of, amboyse, and, they, were, to, retain, it, ever, since, i, ll, say, a, word, about, it, to, settle, the, doubts, of, those, who, have, strayed, in, seeking, its, origin, the, superstition, of, our, ancestors, to, within, twenty, or, thirty, years, thereabouts, was, such, that, in, almost, all, the, towns, in, the, kingdom, they, had, a, notion, that, certain, spirits, underwent, their, purgatory, in, this, world, after, death, and, that, they, went, about, the, town, at, night, striking, and, outraging, many, people, whom, they, found, in, the, streets, but, the, light, of, the, gospel, has, made, them, vanish, and, teaches, us, that, these, spirits, were, street, strollers, and, ruffians, in, paris, the, spirit, was, called, le, moine, bourr, at, orl, ans, le, mulet, odet, at, blois, le, loup, garon, at, tours, le, roy, huguet, and, so, on, in, other, places, now, it, happens, that, those, whom, they, called, lutherans, were, at, that, time, so, narrowly, watched, during, the, day, that, they, were, forced, to, wait, till, night, to, assemble, for, the, purpose, of, praying, god, for, preaching, and, receiving, the, holy, sacrament, so, that, although, they, did, not, frighten, nor, hurt, anybody, the, priests, through, mockery, made, them, the, successors, of, those, spirits, which, roam, the, night, and, thus, that, name, being, quite, common, in, the, mouth, of, the, populace, to, designate, the, evangelical, huguenands, in, the, country, of, tourraine, and, amboyse, it, became, in, vogue, after, that, enterprise, some, have, suggested, the, name, was, derived, with, intended, scorn, from, les, guenon, de, hus, the, monkeys, or, apes, of, jan, hus, by, 1911, there, was, still, no, consensus, in, the, united, states, on, this, interpretation, the, huguenot, cross, is, the, distinctive, emblem, of, the, huguenots, croix, huguenote, it, is, now, an, official, symbol, of, the, glise, des, protestants, r, form, s, french, protestant, church, huguenot, descendants, sometimes, display, this, symbol, as, a, sign, of, reconnaissance, recognition, between, them, the, issue, of, demographic, strength, and, geographical, spread, of, the, reformed, tradition, in, france, has, been, covered, in, a, variety, of, sources, most, of, them, agree, that, the, huguenot, population, reached, as, many, as, 10, of, the, total, population, or, roughly, 2, million, people, on, the, eve, of, the, st, bartholomew, s, day, massacre, in, 1572, the, new, teaching, of, john, calvin, attracted, sizeable, portions, of, the, nobility, and, urban, bourgeoisie, after, john, calvin, introduced, the, reformation, in, france, the, number, of, french, protestants, steadily, swelled, to, ten, percent, of, the, population, or, roughly, 1, 8, million, people, in, the, decade, between, 1560, and, 1570, during, the, same, period, there, were, some, 1, 400, reformed, churches, operating, in, france, hans, j, hillerbrand, an, expert, on, the, subject, in, his, encyclopedia, of, protestantism, 4, volume, set, claims, the, huguenot, community, reached, as, much, as, 10, of, the, french, population, on, the, eve, of, the, st, bartholomew, s, day, massacre, declining, to, 7, to, 8, by, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, and, further, after, heavy, persecution, began, once, again, with, the, revocation, of, the, edict, of, nantes, by, louis, xiv, in, 1685, among, the, nobles, calvinism, peaked, on, the, eve, of, the, st, bartholomew, s, day, massacre, since, then, it, sharply, decreased, as, the, huguenots, were, no, longer, tolerated, by, both, the, french, royalty, and, the, catholic, masses, by, the, end, of, the, sixteenth, century, huguenots, constituted, 7, 8, of, the, whole, population, or, 1, 2, million, people, by, the, time, louis, xiv, revoked, the, edict, of, nantes, in, 1685, huguenots, accounted, for, 800, 000, to, 1, million, people, huguenots, controlled, sizeable, areas, in, southern, and, western, france, in, addition, many, areas, especially, in, the, central, part, of, the, country, were, also, contested, between, the, french, reformed, and, catholic, nobles, demographically, there, were, some, areas, in, which, the, whole, populations, had, been, reformed, these, included, villages, in, and, around, the, massif, central, as, well, as, the, area, around, dordogne, which, used, to, be, almost, entirely, reformed, too, john, calvin, was, a, frenchman, and, himself, largely, responsible, for, the, introduction, and, spread, of, the, reformed, tradition, in, france, he, wrote, in, french, but, unlike, the, protestant, development, in, germany, where, lutheran, writings, were, widely, distributed, and, could, be, read, by, the, common, man, it, was, not, the, case, in, france, where, only, nobles, adopted, the, new, faith, and, the, folk, remained, catholic, this, is, true, for, many, areas, in, the, west, and, south, controlled, by, the, huguenot, nobility, although, relatively, large, portions, of, the, peasant, population, became, reformed, there, the, people, altogether, still, remained, majority, catholic, overall, huguenot, presence, was, heavily, concentrated, in, the, western, and, southern, portions, of, the, french, kingdom, as, nobles, there, secured, practise, of, the, new, faith, these, included, languedoc, roussillon, gascony, and, even, a, strip, of, land, that, stretched, into, the, dauphin, huguenots, lived, on, the, atlantic, coast, in, la, rochelle, and, also, spread, across, provinces, of, normandy, and, poitou, in, the, south, towns, like, castres, montauban, montpellier, and, n, mes, were, huguenot, strongholds, in, addition, a, dense, network, of, protestant, villages, permeated, the, rural, mountainous, region, of, the, cevennes, inhabited, by, camisards, it, continues, to, be, the, backbone, of, french, protestantism, historians, estimate, that, roughly, 80, of, all, huguenots, lived, in, the, western, and, southern, areas, of, france, today, there, are, some, reformed, communities, around, the, world, that, still, retain, their, huguenot, identity, in, france, calvinists, in, the, united, protestant, church, of, france, and, also, some, in, the, protestant, reformed, church, of, alsace, and, lorraine, consider, themselves, huguenots, a, rural, huguenot, community, in, the, cevennes, that, rebelled, in, 1702, is, still, called, camisards, especially, in, historical, contexts, huguenot, exiles, in, the, united, kingdom, the, united, states, south, africa, australia, and, a, number, of, other, countries, still, retain, their, identity, the, bulk, of, huguenot, migr, s, moved, to, protestant, states, such, as, the, dutch, republic, england, and, wales, prominently, in, kent, and, london, protestant, controlled, ireland, the, channel, islands, scotland, denmark, sweden, switzerland, the, electorates, of, brandenburg, and, the, palatinate, in, the, holy, roman, empire, and, the, duchy, of, prussia, some, fled, as, refugees, to, the, dutch, cape, colony, the, dutch, east, indies, various, caribbean, colonies, and, several, of, the, dutch, and, english, colonies, in, north, america, a, few, families, went, to, orthodox, russia, and, catholic, quebec, after, centuries, most, huguenots, assimilated, into, the, various, societies, and, cultures, where, they, have, settled, remnant, communities, of, camisards, in, the, c, vennes, most, reformed, members, of, the, united, protestant, church, of, france, french, members, of, the, largely, german, protestant, reformed, church, of, alsace, and, lorraine, and, the, huguenot, diaspora, in, england, and, australia, all, still, retain, their, beliefs, and, huguenot, designation, the, availability, of, the, bible, in, vernacular, languages, was, important, to, the, spread, of, the, protestant, movement, and, development, of, the, reformed, church, in, france, the, country, had, a, long, history, of, struggles, with, the, papacy, see, the, avignon, papacy, for, example, by, the, time, the, protestant, reformation, finally, arrived, around, 1294, a, french, version, of, the, scriptures, was, prepared, by, the, roman, catholic, priest, guyard, des, moulins, a, two, volume, illustrated, folio, paraphrase, version, based, on, his, manuscript, by, jean, de, r, ly, was, printed, in, paris, in, 1487, the, first, known, translation, of, the, bible, into, one, of, france, s, regional, languages, arpitan, or, franco, proven, al, had, been, prepared, by, the, 12th, century, pre, protestant, reformer, peter, waldo, pierre, de, vaux, the, waldensians, created, fortified, areas, as, in, cabri, res, perhaps, attacking, an, abbey, they, were, suppressed, by, francis, i, in, 1545, in, the, massacre, of, m, rindol, other, predecessors, of, the, reformed, church, included, the, pro, reform, and, gallican, roman, catholics, such, as, jacques, lefevre, c, 1455, 1536, the, gallicans, briefly, achieved, independence, for, the, french, church, on, the, principle, that, the, religion, of, france, could, not, be, controlled, by, the, bishop, of, rome, a, foreign, power, during, the, protestant, reformation, lefevre, a, professor, at, the, university, of, paris, published, his, french, translation, of, the, new, testament, in, 1523, followed, by, the, whole, bible, in, the, french, language, in, 1530, william, farel, was, a, student, of, lefevre, who, went, on, to, become, a, leader, of, the, swiss, reformation, establishing, a, protestant, republican, government, in, geneva, jean, cauvin, john, calvin, another, student, at, the, university, of, paris, also, converted, to, protestantism, long, after, the, sect, was, suppressed, by, francis, i, the, remaining, french, waldensians, then, mostly, in, the, luberon, region, sought, to, join, farel, calvin, and, the, reformation, and, oliv, tan, published, a, french, bible, for, them, the, french, confession, of, 1559, shows, a, decidedly, calvinistic, influence, although, usually, huguenots, are, lumped, into, one, group, there, were, actually, two, types, of, huguenots, that, emerged, since, the, huguenots, had, political, and, religious, goals, it, was, commonplace, to, refer, to, the, calvinists, as, huguenots, of, religion, and, those, who, opposed, the, monarchy, as, huguenots, of, the, state, who, were, mostly, nobles, like, other, religious, reformers, of, the, time, huguenots, felt, that, the, catholic, church, needed, a, radical, cleansing, of, its, impurities, and, that, the, pope, represented, a, worldly, kingdom, which, sat, in, mocking, tyranny, over, the, things, of, god, and, was, ultimately, doomed, rhetoric, like, this, became, fiercer, as, events, unfolded, and, eventually, stirred, up, a, reaction, in, the, catholic, establishment, fanatically, opposed, to, the, catholic, church, the, huguenots, killed, priests, monks, and, nuns, attacked, monasticism, and, destroyed, sacred, images, relics, and, church, buildings, most, of, the, cities, in, which, the, huguenots, gained, a, hold, saw, iconoclast, riots, in, which, altars, and, images, in, churches, and, sometimes, the, buildings, themselves, torn, down, ancient, relics, and, texts, were, destroyed, the, bodies, of, saints, exhumed, and, burned, the, cities, of, bourges, montauban, and, orl, ans, saw, substantial, activity, in, this, regard, the, huguenots, transformed, themselves, into, a, definitive, political, movement, thereafter, protestant, preachers, rallied, a, considerable, army, and, a, formidable, cavalry, which, came, under, the, leadership, of, admiral, gaspard, de, coligny, henry, of, navarre, and, the, house, of, bourbon, allied, themselves, to, the, huguenots, adding, wealth, and, territorial, holdings, to, the, protestant, strength, which, at, its, height, grew, to, sixty, fortified, cities, and, posed, a, serious, and, continuous, threat, to, the, catholic, crown, and, paris, over, the, next, three, decades, the, catholic, church, in, france, and, many, of, its, members, opposed, the, huguenots, some, huguenot, preachers, and, congregants, were, attacked, as, they, attempted, to, meet, for, worship, the, height, of, this, persecution, was, the, st, bartholomew, s, day, massacre, in, august, 1572, when, 5, 000, to, 30, 000, were, killed, although, there, were, also, underlying, political, reasons, for, this, as, well, as, some, of, the, huguenots, were, nobles, trying, to, establish, separate, centres, of, power, in, southern, france, retaliating, against, the, french, catholics, the, huguenots, had, their, own, militia, early, in, his, reign, francis, i, r, 1515, 1547, persecuted, the, old, pre, protestant, movement, of, waldensians, in, southeastern, france, francis, initially, protected, the, huguenot, dissidents, from, parlementary, measures, seeking, to, exterminate, them, after, the, 1534, affair, of, the, placards, however, he, distanced, himself, from, huguenots, and, their, protection, huguenot, numbers, grew, rapidly, between, 1555, and, 1561, chiefly, amongst, nobles, and, city, dwellers, during, this, time, their, opponents, first, dubbed, the, protestants, huguenots, but, they, called, themselves, reform, s, or, reformed, they, organised, their, first, national, synod, in, 1558, in, paris, by, 1562, the, estimated, number, of, huguenots, peaked, at, approximately, two, million, concentrated, mainly, in, the, western, southern, and, some, central, parts, of, france, compared, to, approximately, sixteen, million, catholics, during, the, same, period, persecution, diminished, the, number, of, huguenots, who, remained, in, france, as, the, huguenots, gained, influence, and, displayed, their, faith, more, openly, roman, catholic, hostility, towards, them, grew, even, though, the, french, crown, offered, increasingly, liberal, political, concessions, and, edicts, of, toleration, following, the, accidental, death, of, henry, ii, in, 1559, his, son, succeeded, as, king, francis, ii, along, with, his, wife, the, queen, consort, also, known, as, mary, queen, of, scots, during, the, eighteen, months, of, the, reign, of, francis, ii, mary, encouraged, a, policy, of, rounding, up, french, huguenots, on, charges, of, heresy, and, putting, them, in, front, of, catholic, judges, and, employing, torture, and, burning, as, punishments, for, dissenters, mary, returned, to, scotland, a, widow, in, the, summer, of, 1561, in, 1561, the, edict, of, orl, ans, declared, an, end, to, the, persecution, and, the, edict, of, saint, germain, of, january, 1562, formally, recognised, the, huguenots, for, the, first, time, however, these, measures, disguised, the, growing, tensions, between, protestants, and, catholics, these, tensions, spurred, eight, civil, wars, interrupted, by, periods, of, relative, calm, between, 1562, and, 1598, with, each, break, in, peace, the, huguenots, trust, in, the, catholic, throne, diminished, and, the, violence, became, more, severe, and, protestant, demands, became, grander, until, a, lasting, cessation, of, open, hostility, finally, occurred, in, 1598, the, wars, gradually, took, on, a, dynastic, character, developing, into, an, extended, feud, between, the, houses, of, bourbon, and, guise, both, of, which, in, addition, to, holding, rival, religious, views, staked, a, claim, to, the, french, throne, the, crown, occupied, by, the, house, of, valois, generally, supported, the, catholic, side, but, on, occasion, switched, over, to, the, protestant, cause, when, politically, expedient, the, french, wars, of, religion, began, with, the, massacre, of, vassy, on, 1, march, 1562, when, dozens, some, sources, say, hundreds, of, huguenots, were, killed, and, about, 200, were, wounded, it, was, in, this, year, that, some, huguenots, destroyed, the, tomb, and, remains, of, saint, irenaeus, d, 202, an, early, church, father, and, bishop, who, was, a, disciple, of, polycarp, the, michelade, by, huguenotes, against, catholics, was, later, on, 29, september, 1567, in, what, became, known, as, the, st, bartholomew, s, day, massacre, of, 24, august, 3, october, 1572, catholics, killed, thousands, of, huguenots, in, paris, and, similar, massacres, took, place, in, other, towns, in, the, following, weeks, the, main, provincial, towns, and, cities, experiencing, massacres, were, aix, bordeaux, bourges, lyons, meaux, orl, ans, rouen, toulouse, and, troyes, although, the, exact, number, of, fatalities, throughout, the, country, is, not, known, on, 23, 24, august, between, 2, 000, and, 3, 000, protestants, were, killed, in, paris, and, a, further, 3, 000, to, 7, 000, more, in, the, french, provinces, by, 17, september, almost, 25, 000, protestants, had, been, massacred, in, paris, alone, beyond, paris, the, killings, continued, until, 3, october, an, amnesty, granted, in, 1573, pardoned, the, perpetrators, following, the, killings, many, protestants, fled, to, the, kentish, coast, among, other, places, the, pattern, of, warfare, followed, by, brief, periods, of, peace, continued, for, nearly, another, quarter, century, the, warfare, was, definitively, quelled, in, 1598, when, henry, of, navarre, having, succeeded, to, the, french, throne, as, henry, iv, and, having, recanted, protestantism, in, favour, of, roman, catholicism, in, order, to, obtain, the, french, crown, issued, the, edict, of, nantes, the, edict, reaffirmed, roman, catholicism, as, the, state, religion, of, france, but, granted, the, protestants, equality, with, catholics, under, the, throne, and, a, degree, of, religious, and, political, freedom, within, their, domains, the, edict, simultaneously, protected, catholic, interests, by, discouraging, the, founding, of, new, protestant, churches, in, catholic, controlled, regions, with, the, proclamation, of, the, edict, of, nantes, and, the, subsequent, protection, of, huguenot, rights, pressures, to, leave, france, abated, however, enforcement, of, the, edict, grew, increasingly, irregular, over, time, making, life, so, intolerable, that, many, fled, the, country, the, huguenot, population, of, france, dropped, to, 856, 000, by, the, mid, 1660s, of, which, a, plurality, lived, in, rural, areas, the, greatest, concentrations, of, huguenots, at, this, time, resided, in, the, regions, of, guienne, saintonge, aunis, angoumois, and, poitou, montpellier, was, among, the, most, important, of, the, 66, villes, de, s, ret, cities, of, protection, or, protected, cities, that, the, edict, of, 1598, granted, to, the, huguenots, the, city, s, political, institutions, and, the, university, were, all, handed, over, to, the, huguenots, tension, with, paris, led, to, a, siege, by, the, royal, army, in, 1622, peace, terms, called, for, the, dismantling, of, the, city, s, fortifications, a, royal, citadel, was, built, and, the, university, and, consulate, were, taken, over, by, the, catholic, party, even, before, the, edict, of, al, s, 1629, protestant, rule, was, dead, and, the, ville, de, s, ret, was, no, more, by, 1620, the, huguenots, were, on, the, defensive, and, the, government, increasingly, applied, pressure, a, series, of, three, small, civil, wars, known, as, the, huguenot, rebellions, broke, out, mainly, in, southwestern, france, between, 1621, and, 1629, in, which, the, reformed, areas, revolted, against, royal, authority, the, uprising, occurred, a, decade, following, the, death, of, henry, iv, who, was, assassinated, by, a, catholic, fanatic, in, 1610, his, successor, louis, xiii, under, the, regency, of, his, italian, catholic, mother, marie, de, medici, was, more, intolerant, of, protestantism, the, huguenots, responded, by, establishing, independent, political, and, military, structures, establishing, diplomatic, contacts, with, foreign, powers, and, openly, revolting, against, central, power, the, rebellions, were, implacably, suppressed, by, the, french, crown, louis, xiv, inherited, the, throne, in, 1643, and, acted, increasingly, aggressively, to, force, the, huguenots, to, convert, at, first, he, sent, missionaries, backed, by, a, fund, to, financially, reward, converts, to, roman, catholicism, then, he, imposed, penalties, closed, huguenot, schools, and, excluded, them, from, favoured, professions, escalating, he, instituted, dragonnades, which, included, the, occupation, and, looting, of, huguenot, homes, by, military, troops, in, an, effort, to, forcibly, convert, them, in, 1685, he, issued, the, edict, of, fontainebleau, revoking, the, edict, of, nantes, and, declaring, protestantism, illegal, the, revocation, forbade, protestant, services, required, education, of, children, as, catholics, and, prohibited, emigration, it, proved, disastrous, to, the, huguenots, and, costly, for, france, it, precipitated, civil, bloodshed, ruined, commerce, and, resulted, in, the, illegal, flight, from, the, country, of, hundreds, of, thousands, of, protestants, many, of, whom, were, intellectuals, doctors, and, business, leaders, whose, skills, were, transferred, to, britain, as, well, as, holland, switzerland, prussia, south, africa, and, other, places, they, fled, to, 4, 000, emigrated, to, the, thirteen, colonies, where, they, settled, especially, in, new, york, the, delaware, river, valley, in, eastern, pennsylvania, new, jersey, and, virginia, the, english, authorities, welcomed, the, french, refugees, providing, money, from, both, government, and, private, agencies, to, aid, their, relocation, those, huguenots, who, stayed, in, france, were, subsequently, forcibly, converted, to, roman, catholicism, and, were, called, new, converts, after, this, the, huguenots, with, estimates, ranging, from, 200, 000, to, 1, 000, 000, fled, to, protestant, countries, england, the, netherlands, switzerland, norway, denmark, and, prussia, whose, calvinist, great, elector, frederick, william, welcomed, them, to, help, rebuild, his, war, ravaged, and, underpopulated, country, following, this, exodus, huguenots, remained, in, large, numbers, in, only, one, region, of, france, the, rugged, c, vennes, region, in, the, south, there, were, also, some, calvinists, in, the, alsace, region, which, then, belonged, to, the, holy, roman, empire, in, the, early, 18th, century, a, regional, group, known, as, the, camisards, who, were, huguenots, of, the, mountainous, massif, central, region, rioted, against, the, catholic, church, burning, churches, and, killing, the, clergy, it, took, french, troops, years, to, hunt, down, and, destroy, all, the, bands, of, camisards, between, 1702, and, 1709, by, the, 1760s, protestantism, was, no, longer, a, favourite, religion, of, the, elite, by, then, most, protestants, were, c, vennes, peasants, it, was, still, illegal, and, although, the, law, was, seldom, enforced, it, could, be, a, threat, or, a, nuisance, to, protestants, calvinists, lived, primarily, in, the, midi, about, 200, 000, lutherans, accompanied, by, some, calvinists, lived, in, the, newly, acquired, alsace, where, the, 1648, treaty, of, westphalia, effectively, protected, them, persecution, of, protestants, diminished, in, france, after, 1724, finally, ending, with, the, edict, of, versailles, commonly, called, the, edict, of, tolerance, signed, by, louis, xvi, in, 1787, two, years, later, with, the, declaration, of, the, rights, of, man, and, citizen, of, 1789, protestants, gained, equal, rights, as, citizens, the, government, encouraged, descendants, of, exiles, to, return, offering, them, french, citizenship, in, a, 15, december, 1790, law, all, persons, born, in, a, foreign, country, and, descending, in, any, degree, of, a, french, man, or, woman, expatriated, for, religious, reason, are, declared, french, nationals, naturels, fran, ais, and, will, benefit, from, rights, attached, to, that, quality, if, they, come, back, to, france, establish, their, domicile, there, and, take, the, civic, oath, article, 4, of, 26, june, 1889, nationality, law, stated, descendants, of, families, proscribed, by, the, revocation, of, the, edict, of, nantes, will, continue, to, benefit, from, the, benefit, of, 15, december, 1790, law, but, on, the, condition, that, a, nominal, decree, should, be, issued, for, every, petitioner, that, decree, will, only, produce, its, effects, for, the, future, foreign, descendants, of, huguenots, lost, the, automatic, right, to, french, citizenship, in, 1945, by, force, of, the, ordonnance, n, 45, 2441, du, 19, octobre, 1945, which, revoked, the, 1889, nationality, law, it, states, in, article, 3, this, application, does, not,

still, regard, themselves, as, huguenots, to, this, day, surveys, suggest, that, protestantism, has, grown, in, recent, years, though, this, is, due, primarily, to, the, expansion, of, evangelical, protestant, churches, which, particularly, have, adherents, among, immigrant, groups, that, are, generally, considered, distinct, from, the, french, huguenot, population, a, diaspora, of, french, australians, still, considers, itself, huguenot, even, after, centuries, of, exile, long, integrated, into, australian, society, it, is, encouraged, by, the, huguenot, society, of, australia, to,
