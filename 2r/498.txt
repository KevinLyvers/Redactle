reforms, aimed, at, modernizing, iran, in, the, white, revolution, due, to, his, opposition, to, modernization, khomeini, was, exiled, from, iran, in, 1964, however, as, ideological, tensions, persisted, between, pahlavi, and, khomeini, anti, government, demonstrations, began, in, october, 1977, developing, into, a, campaign, of, civil, resistance, that, included, communism, socialism, and, islamism, in, august, 1978, the, deaths, of, about, 400, people, in, the, cinema, rex, fire, claimed, by, the, opposition, as, having, been, orchestrated, by, pahlavi, s, savak, served, as, a, catalyst, for, a, popular, revolutionary, movement, across, iran, and, large, scale, strikes, and, demonstrations, paralyzed, the, country, for, the, remainder, of, that, year, on, 16, january, 1979, pahlavi, went, into, exile, as, the, last, iranian, monarch, by, birth, leaving, his, duties, to, iran, s, regency, council, and, shapour, bakhtiar, the, opposition, based, prime, minister, on, 1,

leader, of, iran, in, december, 1979, the, success, of, the, revolution, was, met, with, surprise, around, the, world, as, it, was, unusual, it, lacked, many, customary, causes, of, revolutionary, sentiment, e, g, defeat, in, war, financial, crisis, peasant, rebellion, or, disgruntled, military, it, occurred, in, a, country, experiencing, relative, prosperity, produced, profound, change, at, great, speed, was, very, popular, resulted, in, a, massive, exile, that, characterizes, a, large, portion, of, iranian, diaspora, and, replaced, a, pro, western, secular, and, authoritarian, monarchy, with, an, anti, western, islamist, theocratic, monarchy, based, on, the, concept, of, vel, yat, e, faqih, guardianship, of, the, islamic, jurist, straddling, between, authoritarianism, and, totalitarianism, in, addition, to, declaring, the, destruction, of, israel, as, a, core, objective, post, revolutionary, iran, aimed, to, undermine, the, influence, of, sunni, leaders, in, the, region, by, supporting, shi, ite, political, ascendancy, and, exporting, khomeinist, doctrines, abroad, in, the, aftermath, of, the, revolution, iran, began, to, back, shia, militancy, across, the, region, to, combat, sunni, influence, and, establish, iranian, dominance, in, the, arab, world, ultimately, aiming, to, achieve, an, iranian, led, shia, political, order, reasons, advanced, for, the, revolution, and, its, populist, nationalist, and, later, shia, islamic, character, include, the, shah, s, regime, was, seen, as, an, oppressive, brutal, corrupt, and, lavish, regime, by, some, of, the, society, s, classes, at, that, time, it, also, suffered, from, some, basic, functional, failures, that, brought, economic, bottlenecks, shortages, and, inflation, the, shah, was, perceived, by, many, as, beholden, to, if, not, a, puppet, of, a, non, muslim, western, power, i, e, the, united, states, whose, culture, was, affecting, that, of, iran, at, the, same, time, support, for, the, shah, may, have, waned, among, western, politicians, and, media, especially, under, the, administration, of, u, s, president, jimmy, carter, as, a, result, of, the, shah, s, support, for, opec, petroleum, price, increases, earlier, in, the, decade, when, president, carter, enacted, a, human, rights, policy, which, said, that, countries, guilty, of, human, rights, violations, would, be, deprived, of, american, arms, or, aid, this, helped, give, some, iranians, the, courage, to, post, open, letters, and, petitions, in, the, hope, that, the, repression, by, the, government, might, subside, the, revolution, that, substituted, the, monarchy, of, mohammad, reza, pahlavi, with, islam, and, khomeini, is, credited, in, part, to, the, spread, of, the, shi, a, version, of, the, islamic, revival, it, resisted, westernization, and, saw, ayatollah, khomeini, as, following, in, the, footsteps, of, the, shi, a, imam, husayn, ibn, ali, with, the, shah, playing, the, role, of, husayn, s, foe, the, hated, tyrant, yazid, i, other, factors, include, the, underestimation, of, khomeini, s, islamist, movement, by, both, the, shah, s, reign, who, considered, them, a, minor, threat, compared, to, the, marxists, and, islamic, socialists, and, by, the, secularist, opponents, of, the, government, who, thought, the, khomeinists, could, be, sidelined, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, shi, a, clergy, ulama, had, a, significant, influence, on, iranian, society, the, clergy, first, showed, itself, to, be, a, powerful, political, force, in, opposition, to, the, monarchy, with, the, 1891, tobacco, protest, on, 20, march, 1890, the, long, standing, iranian, monarch, nasir, al, din, shah, granted, a, concession, to, british, major, g, f, talbot, for, a, full, monopoly, over, the, production, sale, and, export, of, tobacco, for, 50, years, at, the, time, the, persian, tobacco, industry, employed, over, 200, 000, people, so, the, concession, represented, a, major, blow, to, persian, farmers, and, bazaaris, whose, livelihoods, were, largely, dependent, on, the, lucrative, tobacco, business, the, boycotts, and, protests, against, it, were, widespread, and, extensive, as, result, of, mirza, hasan, shirazi, s, fatwa, judicial, decree, within, 2, years, nasir, al, din, shah, found, himself, powerless, to, stop, the, popular, movement, and, cancelled, the, concession, the, tobacco, protest, was, the, first, significant, iranian, resistance, against, the, shah, and, foreign, interests, revealing, the, power, of, the, people, and, the, ulama, influence, among, them, the, growing, dissatisfaction, continued, until, the, constitutional, revolution, of, 1905, 1911, the, revolution, led, to, the, establishment, of, a, parliament, the, national, consultative, assembly, also, known, as, the, majlis, and, approval, of, the, first, constitution, although, the, constitutional, revolution, was, successful, in, weakening, the, autocracy, of, the, qajar, regime, it, failed, to, provide, a, powerful, alternative, government, therefore, in, the, decades, following, the, establishment, of, the, new, parliament, a, number, of, critical, events, took, place, many, of, these, events, can, be, viewed, as, a, continuation, of, the, struggle, between, the, constitutionalists, and, the, shahs, of, persia, many, of, whom, were, backed, by, foreign, powers, against, the, parliament, insecurity, and, chaos, created, after, the, constitutional, revolution, led, to, the, rise, of, general, reza, khan, the, commander, of, the, elite, persian, cossack, brigade, who, seized, power, in, a, coup, d, tat, in, february, 1921, he, established, a, constitutional, monarchy, deposing, the, last, qajar, shah, ahmad, shah, in, 1925, and, being, designated, monarch, by, the, national, assembly, to, be, known, thenceforth, as, reza, shah, founder, of, the, pahlavi, dynasty, there, were, widespread, social, economic, and, political, reforms, introduced, during, his, reign, a, number, of, which, led, to, public, discontent, that, would, provide, the, circumstances, for, the, iranian, revolution, particularly, controversial, was, the, replacement, of, islamic, laws, with, western, ones, and, the, forbidding, of, traditional, islamic, clothing, separation, of, the, sexes, and, veiling, of, women, s, faces, with, the, niqab, police, forcibly, removed, and, tore, chadors, off, women, who, resisted, his, ban, on, the, public, hijab, in, 1935, dozens, were, killed, and, hundreds, injured, in, the, goharshad, mosque, rebellion, on, the, other, hand, during, the, early, rise, of, reza, shah, abdul, karim, ha, eri, yazdi, founded, the, qom, seminary, and, created, important, changes, in, seminaries, however, he, would, avoid, entering, into, political, issues, as, did, other, religious, leaders, who, followed, him, hence, no, widespread, anti, government, attempts, were, organized, by, the, clergy, during, the, rule, of, reza, shah, however, the, future, ayatollah, khomeini, was, a, student, of, sheikh, abdul, karim, ha, eri, in, 1941, an, invasion, of, allied, british, and, soviet, troops, deposed, reza, shah, who, was, considered, friendly, to, nazi, germany, and, installed, his, son, mohammad, reza, pahlavi, as, shah, iran, remained, under, soviet, occupation, until, the, red, army, withdrew, in, june, 1946, the, post, war, years, were, characterized, by, political, instability, as, the, shah, clashed, with, the, pro, soviet, prime, minister, ahmad, qavam, the, communist, tudeh, party, grew, in, size, and, influence, and, the, iranian, army, had, to, deal, with, soviet, sponsored, separatist, movements, in, iranian, azerbaijan, and, iranian, kurdistan, from, 1901, on, the, anglo, persian, oil, company, renamed, the, anglo, iranian, oil, company, in, 1935, a, british, oil, company, enjoyed, a, monopoly, on, sale, and, production, of, iranian, oil, it, was, the, most, profitable, british, business, in, the, world, most, iranians, lived, in, poverty, while, the, wealth, generated, from, iranian, oil, played, a, decisive, role, in, maintaining, britain, as, a, preeminent, global, power, in, 1951, iranian, prime, minister, mohammad, mosaddegh, pledged, to, throw, the, company, out, of, iran, reclaim, the, petroleum, reserves, and, free, iran, from, foreign, powers, in, 1952, mosaddegh, nationalized, the, anglo, iranian, oil, company, and, became, a, national, hero, the, british, however, were, outraged, and, accused, him, of, stealing, the, british, unsuccessfully, sought, punishment, from, the, international, court, of, justice, and, the, united, nations, sent, warships, to, the, persian, gulf, and, finally, imposed, a, crushing, embargo, mosaddegh, was, unmoved, by, britain, s, campaign, against, him, one, european, newspaper, the, frankfurter, neue, presse, reported, that, mosaddegh, would, rather, be, fried, in, persian, oil, than, make, the, slightest, concession, to, the, british, the, british, considered, an, armed, invasion, but, uk, prime, minister, winston, churchill, decided, on, a, coup, after, being, refused, american, military, support, by, u, s, president, harry, s, truman, who, sympathized, with, nationalist, movements, like, mosaddegh, s, and, had, nothing, but, contempt, for, old, style, imperialists, like, those, who, ran, the, anglo, iranian, oil, company, mosaddegh, however, learned, of, churchill, s, plans, and, ordered, the, british, embassy, to, be, closed, in, october, 1952, forcing, all, british, diplomats, and, agents, to, leave, the, country, although, the, british, were, initially, turned, down, in, their, request, for, american, support, by, president, truman, the, election, of, dwight, d, eisenhower, as, u, s, president, in, november, 1952, changed, the, american, stance, toward, the, conflict, on, 20, january, 1953, u, s, secretary, of, state, john, foster, dulles, and, his, brother, c, i, a, director, allen, dulles, told, their, british, counterparts, that, they, were, ready, to, move, against, mosaddegh, in, their, eyes, any, country, not, decisively, allied, with, the, united, states, was, a, potential, enemy, iran, had, immense, oil, wealth, a, long, border, with, the, soviet, union, and, a, nationalist, prime, minister, the, prospect, of, a, fall, into, communism, and, a, second, china, after, mao, zedong, won, the, chinese, civil, war, terrified, the, dulles, brothers, operation, ajax, was, born, in, which, the, only, democratic, government, iran, ever, had, was, deposed, on, 15, august, 1953, a, coup, d, tat, was, initiated, to, remove, mosaddegh, with, the, support, of, the, united, states, the, united, kingdom, and, most, of, the, shia, clergy, the, shah, fled, to, italy, when, the, initial, coup, attempt, on, august, 15, failed, but, returned, after, a, successful, second, attempt, on, august, 19, mosaddegh, was, removed, from, power, and, put, under, house, arrest, while, lieutenant, general, fazlollah, zahedi, was, appointed, as, new, prime, minister, by, the, shah, the, sovereign, who, was, mainly, seen, as, a, figurehead, at, the, time, eventually, managed, to, break, free, from, the, shackles, of, the, iranian, elites, and, impose, himself, as, an, autocratic, reformist, ruler, pahlavi, maintained, a, close, relationship, with, the, u, s, government, as, both, regimes, shared, opposition, to, the, expansion, of, the, soviet, union, iran, s, powerful, northern, neighbor, leftist, and, islamist, groups, attacked, his, government, often, from, outside, iran, as, they, were, suppressed, within, for, violating, the, iranian, constitution, political, corruption, and, the, political, oppression, torture, and, killings, by, the, savak, secret, police, the, white, revolution, was, a, far, reaching, series, of, reforms, in, iran, launched, in, 1963, by, shah, mohammad, reza, pahlavi, and, lasting, until, 1979, mohammad, reza, shah, s, reform, program, was, built, especially, to, weaken, those, classes, that, supported, the, traditional, system, it, consisted, of, several, elements, including, land, reform, sales, of, some, state, owned, factories, to, finance, the, land, reform, the, enfranchisement, of, women, nationalization, of, forests, and, pastures, formation, of, a, literacy, corps, and, the, institution, of, profit, sharing, schemes, for, workers, in, industry, the, shah, advertised, the, white, revolution, as, a, step, towards, westernization, and, it, was, a, way, for, him, to, legitimize, the, pahlavi, dynasty, part, of, the, reason, for, launching, the, white, revolution, was, that, the, shah, hoped, to, get, rid, of, the, influence, of, landlords, and, to, create, a, new, base, of, support, among, the, peasants, and, working, class, thus, the, white, revolution, in, iran, was, an, attempt, to, introduce, reform, from, above, and, preserve, traditional, power, patterns, through, land, reform, the, essence, of, the, white, revolution, the, shah, hoped, to, ally, himself, with, the, peasantry, in, the, countryside, and, hoped, to, sever, their, ties, with, the, aristocracy, in, the, city, what, the, shah, did, not, expect, however, was, that, the, white, revolution, led, to, new, social, tensions, that, helped, create, many, of, the, problems, the, shah, had, been, trying, to, avoid, the, shah, s, reforms, more, than, quadrupled, the, combined, size, of, the, two, classes, that, had, posed, the, most, challenges, to, his, monarchy, in, the, past, the, intelligentsia, and, the, urban, working, class, their, resentment, towards, the, shah, also, grew, as, they, were, now, stripped, of, organizations, that, had, represented, them, in, the, past, such, as, political, parties, professional, associations, trade, unions, and, independent, newspapers, the, land, reform, instead, of, allying, the, peasants, with, the, government, produced, large, numbers, of, independent, farmers, and, landless, laborers, who, became, loose, political, cannons, with, no, feeling, of, loyalty, to, the, shah, many, of, the, masses, felt, resentment, towards, the, increasingly, corrupt, government, their, loyalty, to, the, clergy, who, were, seen, as, more, concerned, with, the, fate, of, the, populace, remained, consistent, or, increased, as, ervand, abrahamian, pointed, out, the, white, revolution, had, been, designed, to, preempt, a, red, revolution, instead, it, paved, the, way, for, an, islamic, revolution, in, theory, oil, money, funneled, to, the, elite, was, supposed, to, be, used, to, create, jobs, and, factories, eventually, distributing, the, money, but, instead, the, wealth, tended, to, remain, concentrated, in, the, hands, of, the, very, few, at, the, top, the, post, revolutionary, leader, twelver, shia, cleric, ayatollah, ruhollah, khomeini, first, came, to, political, prominence, in, 1963, when, he, led, opposition, to, the, shah, and, his, white, revolution, khomeini, was, arrested, in, 1963, after, declaring, the, shah, a, wretched, miserable, man, who, had, embarked, on, the, destruction, of, islam, in, iran, three, days, of, major, riots, throughout, iran, followed, with, 15, 000, dead, from, police, fire, as, reported, by, opposition, sources, however, anti, revolutionary, sources, conjectured, that, just, 32, were, killed, khomeini, was, released, after, eight, months, of, house, arrest, and, continued, his, agitation, condemning, iran, s, close, cooperation, with, israel, and, its, capitulations, or, extension, of, diplomatic, immunity, to, american, government, personnel, in, iran, in, november, 1964, khomeini, was, re, arrested, and, sent, into, exile, where, he, remained, for, 15, years, mostly, in, najaf, iraq, until, the, revolution, in, this, interim, period, of, disaffected, calm, the, budding, iranian, revival, began, to, undermine, the, idea, of, westernization, as, progress, that, was, the, basis, of, the, shah, s, secular, reign, and, to, form, the, ideology, of, the, 1979, revolution, jalal, al, e, ahmad, s, idea, of, gharbzadegi, that, western, culture, was, a, plague, or, an, intoxication, to, be, eliminated, ali, shariati, s, vision, of, islam, as, the, one, true, liberator, of, the, third, world, from, oppressive, colonialism, neo, colonialism, and, capitalism, and, morteza, motahhari, s, popularized, retellings, of, the, shia, faith, all, spread, and, gained, listeners, readers, and, supporters, most, importantly, khomeini, preached, that, revolt, and, especially, martyrdom, against, injustice, and, tyranny, was, part, of, shia, islam, and, that, muslims, should, reject, the, influence, of, both, liberal, capitalism, and, communism, ideas, that, inspired, the, revolutionary, slogan, neither, east, nor, west, islamic, republic, away, from, public, view, khomeini, developed, the, ideology, of, velayat, e, faqih, guardianship, of, the, jurist, as, government, that, muslims, in, fact, everyone, required, guardianship, in, the, form, of, rule, or, supervision, by, the, leading, islamic, jurist, or, jurists, such, rule, was, ultimately, more, necessary, even, than, prayer, and, fasting, in, islam, as, it, would, protect, islam, from, deviation, from, traditional, sharia, law, and, in, so, doing, eliminate, poverty, injustice, and, the, plundering, of, muslim, land, by, foreign, non, believers, this, idea, of, rule, by, islamic, jurists, was, spread, through, his, book, islamic, government, mosque, sermons, and, smuggled, cassette, speeches, by, khomeini, among, his, opposition, network, of, students, talabeh, ex, students, able, clerics, such, as, morteza, motahhari, mohammad, beheshti, mohammad, javad, bahonar, akbar, hashemi, rafsanjani, and, mohammad, mofatteh, and, traditional, businessmen, bazaari, inside, iran, other, opposition, groups, included, constitutionalist, liberals, the, democratic, reformist, islamic, freedom, movement, of, iran, headed, by, mehdi, bazargan, and, the, more, secular, national, front, they, were, based, in, the, urban, middle, class, and, wanted, the, shah, to, adhere, to, the, iranian, constitution, of, 1906, rather, than, to, replace, him, with, a, theocracy, but, lacked, the, cohesion, and, organization, of, khomeini, s, forces, communist, groups, primarily, the, tudeh, party, of, iran, and, the, fedaian, guerrillas, had, been, weakened, considerably, by, government, repression, despite, this, the, guerrillas, did, help, play, an, important, part, in, the, final, february, 1979, overthrow, delivering, the, regime, its, coup, de, grace, the, most, powerful, guerrilla, group, the, people, s, mujahedin, was, leftist, islamist, and, opposed, the, influence, of, the, clergy, as, reactionary, some, important, clergy, did, not, follow, khomeini, s, lead, popular, ayatollah, mahmoud, taleghani, supported, the, left, while, perhaps, the, most, senior, and, influential, ayatollah, in, iran, mohammad, kazem, shariatmadari, first, remained, aloof, from, politics, and, then, came, out, in, support, of, a, democratic, revolution, khomeini, worked, to, unite, this, opposition, behind, him, except, for, the, unwanted, atheistic, marxists, focusing, on, the, socio, economic, problems, of, the, shah, s, government, corruption, and, unequal, income, and, development, while, avoiding, specifics, among, the, public, that, might, divide, the, factions, particularly, his, plan, for, clerical, rule, which, he, believed, most, iranians, had, become, prejudiced, against, as, a, result, of, propaganda, campaign, by, western, imperialists, in, the, post, shah, era, some, revolutionaries, who, clashed, with, his, theocracy, and, were, suppressed, by, his, movement, complained, of, deception, but, in, the, meantime, anti, shah, unity, was, maintained, several, events, in, the, 1970s, set, the, stage, for, the, 1979, revolution, the, 1971, 2, 500, year, celebration, of, the, persian, empire, at, persepolis,

were, starving, five, years, later, the, shah, angered, pious, iranian, muslims, by, changing, the, first, year, of, the, iranian, solar, calendar, from, the, islamic, hijri, to, the, ascension, to, the, throne, by, cyrus, the, great, iran, jumped, overnight, from, the, muslim, year, 1355, to, the, royalist, year, 2535, the, oil, boom, of, the, 1970s, produced, an, alarming, increase, in, inflation, waste, and, an, accelerating, gap, between, the, rich, and, poor, the, city, and, the, country, along, with, the, presence, of, tens, of, thousands, of, unpopular, skilled, foreign, workers, many, iranians, were, also, angered, by, the, fact, that, the, shah, s, family, was, the, foremost, beneficiary, of, the, income, generated, by, oil, and, the, line, between, state, earnings, and, family, earnings, blurred, by, 1976, the, shah, had, accumulated, upward, of, 1, billion, from, oil, revenue, his, family, including, 63, princes, and, princesses, had, accumulated, between, 5, and, 20, billion, and, the, family, foundation, controlled, approximately, 3, billion, by, mid, 1977, economic, austerity, measures, to, fight, inflation, disproportionately, affected, the, thousands,

markets, in, 1977, the, shah, responded, to, the, polite, reminder, of, the, importance, of, political, rights, by, the, new, american, president, jimmy, carter, by, granting, amnesty, to, some, prisoners, and, allowing, the, red, cross, to, visit, prisons, through, 1977, liberal, opposition, formed, organizations, and, issued, open, letters, denouncing, the, government, against, this, background, a, first, crucial, manifestation, of, public, expression, of, social, discontent, and, political, protest, against, the, regime, took, place, in, october, 1977, when, the, german, iranian,

ruhollah, khomeini, he, mysteriously, died, at, midnight, on, 23, october, 1977, in, najaf, iraq, savak, and, the, iraqi, government, declared, heart, attack, as, the, cause, of, death, though, many, believed, his, death, was, attributed, to, savak, khomeini, remained, silent, after, the, incident, while, in, iran, with, the, spread, of, the, news, came, a, wave, of, protest, and, mourning, ceremonies, in, several, cities, the, mourning, of, mostafa, was, given, a, political, cast, by, khomeini, s, political, credentials, their, enduring, opposition, to, the, monarchy, and, their, exile, this, dimension, of, the, ceremonies, went, beyond, the, religious, credentials, of, the, family, on, 7, january, 1978, an, article, titled, iran, and, red, and, black, colonization, appeared, in, the, national, daily, ettela, at, newspaper, written, under, a, pseudonym, by, a, government, agent, it, denounced, khomeini, as, a, british, agent, and, a, mad, indian, poet, conspiring, to, sell, out, iran, to, neo, colonialists, and, communists, the, developments, initiated, by, seminaries, in, the, city, of, qom, closing, on, 7, january, 1978, were, followed, by, the, bazaar, and, seminary, closing, and, students, rallied, towards, the, homes, of, the, religious, leaders, on, the, next, day, on, 9, january, 1978, seminary, students, and, other, people, demonstrated, in, the, city, which, was, cracked, down, by, the, shah, s, security, forces, who, shot, live, ammunition, to, disperse, the, crowd, when, the, peaceful, demonstration, turned, violent, between, 5, 300, of, the, demonstrators, were, reportedly, killed, in, the, protest, 9, january, 1978, 19, dey, is, regarded, as, a, bloody, day, in, qom, according, to, shia, customs, memorial, services, chehelom, are, held, 40, days, after, a, person, s, death, encouraged, by, khomeini, who, declared, that, the, blood, of, martyrs, must, water, the, tree, of, islam, radicals, pressured, the, mosques, and, moderate, clergy, to, commemorate, the, deaths, of, the, students, and, used, the, occasion, to, generate, protests, the, informal, network, of, mosques, and, bazaars, which, for, years, had, been, used, to, carry, out, religious, events, increasingly, became, consolidated, as, a, coordinated, protest, organization, on, 18, february, 40, days, after, the, qom, protests, demonstrations, broke, out, in, various, different, cities, the, largest, was, in, tabriz, which, descended, into, a, full, scale, riot, western, and, government, symbols, such, as, cinemas, bars, state, owned, banks, and, police, stations, were, set, ablaze, units, of, the, imperial, iranian, army, were, deployed, to, the, city, to, restore, order, the, death, toll, according, to, the, government, was, 6, while, khomeini, claimed, hundreds, were, martyred, forty, days, later, on, 29, march, demonstrations, were, organized, in, at, least, 55, cities, including, tehran, in, an, increasingly, predictable, pattern, deadly, riots, broke, out, in, major, cities, and, again, 40, days, later, on, 10, may, it, led, to, an, incident, in, which, army, commandos, opened, fire, on, shariatmadari, s, house, killing, one, of, his, students, shariatmadari, immediately, made, a, public, announcement, declaring, his, support, for, a, constitutional, government, and, a, return, to, the, policies, of, the, 1906, constitution, the, shah, was, taken, completely, by, surprise, by, the, protests, and, to, make, matters, worse, he, often, became, indecisive, during, times, of, crisis, virtually, every, major, decision, he, would, make, backfired, on, his, government, and, further, inflamed, the, revolutionaries, the, shah, decided, to, continue, on, his, plan, of, liberalization, and, to, negotiate, rather, than, to, use, force, against, the, still, nascent, protest, movement, he, promised, that, fully, democratic, elections, for, the, majlis, would, be, held, in, 1979, censorship, was, relaxed, a, resolution, was, drafted, to, help, reduce, corruption, within, the, royal, family, and, the, government, and, protesters, were, tried, in, civilian, courts, rather, than, by, military, courts, martial, and, were, quickly, released, iran, s, security, forces, had, not, received, any, riot, control, training, nor, equipment, since, 1963, as, a, result, police, forces, were, unable, to, control, demonstrations, thus, the, army, was, frequently, deployed, soldiers, were, instructed, not, to, use, deadly, force, yet, there, were, instances, of, inexperienced, soldiers, reacting, excessively, inflaming, the, violence, without, cowing, the, opposition, and, receiving, official, condemnation, from, the, shah, the, carter, administration, in, the, us, also, refused, to, sell, non, lethal, tear, gas, and, rubber, bullets, to, iran, as, early, as, the, february, riots, in, tabriz, the, shah, fired, all, savak, officials, in, the, city, as, a, concession, to, the, opposition, and, soon, began, to, dismiss, civil, servants, and, government, officials, whom, he, felt, the, public, blamed, in, the, first, national, concession, he, replaced, the, hardline, savak, chief, general, nematollah, nassiri, with, the, more, moderate, general, nasser, moghaddam, the, government, also, negotiated, with, moderate, religious, leaders, such, as, shariatmadari, apologizing, to, him, for, the, raid, on, his, house, by, summer, the, protests, had, stagnated, remaining, at, a, steady, rate, for, four, months, with, about, 10, 000, participants, in, each, major, city, with, the, exception, of, isfahan, where, protests, were, larger, and, tehran, where, they, were, smaller, protesting, every, 40, days, this, amounted, to, a, small, minority, of, the, more, than, 15, million, adults, in, iran, against, the, wishes, of, khomeini, shariatmadari, called, for, 17, june, mourning, protests, to, be, carried, out, as, a, one, day, stay, although, tensions, remained, in, the, milieu, the, shah, s, policy, appeared, to, have, worked, leading, amuzegar, to, declare, that, the, crisis, is, over, a, cia, analysis, in, august, concluded, that, iran, is, not, in, a, revolutionary, or, even, a, pre, revolutionary, situation, these, and, later, events, in, iran, are, frequently, cited, as, one, of, the, most, consequential, strategic, surprises, that, the, united, states, has, experienced, since, the, cia, was, established, in, 1947, as, a, sign, of, easing, of, government, restrictions, three, prominent, opposition, leaders, from, the, secular, national, front, karim, sanjabi, shahpour, bakhtiar, and, dariush, forouhar, were, allowed, to, pen, an, open, letter, to, the, shah, demanding, that, he, reign, according, to, the, constitution, of, iran, by, august, the, protests, had, kick, into, high, gear, and, the, number, of, demonstrators, mushroomed, to, hundreds, of, thousands, in, an, attempt, to, dampen, inflation, the, amuzegar, administration, cut, spending, and, reduced, business, however, the, cutbacks, led, to, a, sharp, rise, in, layoffs, particularly, among, young, unskilled, male, workers, living, in, the, working, class, districts, by, summer, 1978, the, working, class, joined, the, street, protests, in, massive, numbers, in, addition, it, was, the, islamic, holy, month, of, ramadan, bringing, a, sense, of, increased, religiosity, among, many, people, a, series, of, escalating, protests, broke, out, in, major, cities, and, deadly, riots, broke, out, in, isfahan, where, protesters, fought, for, the, release, of, ayatollah, jalaluddin, taheri, martial, law, was, declared, in, the, city, on, 11, august, as, symbols, of, western, culture, and, government, buildings, were, burned, and, a, bus, full, of, american, workers, was, bombed, due, to, his, failure, to, stop, the, protests, prime, minister, amuzegar, offered, his, resignation, the, shah, increasingly, felt, that, he, was, losing, control, of, the, situation, and, hoped, to, regain, it, through, complete, appeasement, he, decided, to, appoint, jafar, sharif, emami, to, the, post, of, prime, minister, himself, a, veteran, prime, minister, emami, was, chosen, due, to, his, family, ties, to, the, clergy, although, he, had, a, reputation, of, corruption, during, his, previous, premiership, under, the, shah, s, guidance, sharif, emami, effectively, began, a, policy, of, appeasing, the, opposition, s, demands, before, they, even, made, them, the, government, abolished, the, rastakhiz, party, legalized, all, political, parties, and, released, political, prisoners, increased, freedom, of, expression, curtailed, savak, s, authority, and, dismissed, 34, of, its, commanders, closed, down, casinos, and, nightclubs, and, abolished, the, imperial, calendar, the, government, also, began, to, prosecute, corrupt, government, and, royal, family, members, sharif, emami, entered, into, negotiations, with, shariatmadari, and, national, front, leader, karim, sanjabi, to, help, organize, future, elections, censorship, was, effectively, terminated, and, the, newspapers, began, reporting, heavily, on, demonstrations, often, highly, critically, and, negatively, of, the, shah, the, majlis, parliament, also, began, issuing, resolutions, against, the, government, on, 19, august, in, the, southwestern, city, of, abadan, four, arsonists, barred, the, door, of, the, cinema, rex, movie, theatre, and, set, it, on, fire, in, what, would, be, the, largest, terrorist, attack, in, history, prior, to, the, september, 11, attacks, in, the, us, in, 2001, 422, people, inside, the, theatre, were, burned, to, death, khomeini, immediately, blamed, the, shah, and, savak, for, setting, the, fire, and, due, to, the, pervasive, revolutionary, atmosphere, the, public, also, blamed, the, shah, for, starting, the, fire, despite, the, government, s, insistence, that, they, were, uninvolved, tens, of, thousands, of, people, took, to, the, streets, shouting, burn, the, shah, and, the, shah, is, the, guilty, one, after, the, islamic, republic, government, executed, a, police, officer, for, the, act, a, man, claiming, to, be, the, lone, surviving, arsonist, claimed, he, was, responsible, for, starting, the, fire, after, forcing, the, resignation, of, the, presiding, judges, in, an, attempt, to, hamper, the, investigation, the, new, government, finally, executed, hossein, talakhzadeh, for, setting, the, fire, on, the, shah, s, orders, the, 4th, of, september, marked, eid, al, fitr, the, holiday, celebrating, the, end, of, the, month, of, ramadan, a, permit, for, an, open, air, prayer, was, granted, in, which, 200, 000, 500, 000, people, attended, instead, the, clergy, directed, the, crowd, on, a, large, march, through, the, center, of, tehran, while, the, shah, reportedly, watched, the, march, from, his, helicopter, unnerved, and, confused, a, few, days, later, even, larger, protests, took, place, and, for, the, first, time, protesters, called, for, khomeini, s, return, and, the, establishment, of, an, islamic, republic, at, midnight, on, 8, september, the, shah, declared, martial, law, in, tehran, and, 11, other, major, cities, throughout, the, country, all, street, demonstrations, were, banned, and, a, night, time, curfew, was, established, tehran, s, martial, law, commander, was, general, gholam, ali, oveissi, who, was, known, for, his, severity, against, opponents, however, the, shah, made, clear, that, once, martial, law, was, lifted, he, intended, to, continue, with, the, liberalization, he, retained, sharif, emami, s, civilian, government, hoping, that, protesters, would, avoid, taking, the, streets, however, 5, 000, protesters, took, to, the, streets, either, in, defiance, or, because, they, had, missed, hearing, the, declaration, and, faced, off, with, soldiers, at, jaleh, square, after, the, firing, of, warning, shots, failed, to, disperse, the, crowd, troops, fired, directly, into, the, crowd, killing, 64, while, general, oveissi, claimed, that, 30, soldiers, were, killed, by, armed, snipers, in, surrounding, buildings, additional, clashes, throughout, the, day, which, would, be, called, black, friday, by, the, opposition, brought, the, opposition, death, toll, to, 89, the, deaths, shocked, the, country, and, damaged, any, attempt, at, reconciliation, between, the, shah, and, the, opposition, khomeini, immediately, declared, that, 4, 000, innocent, protesters, were, massacred, by, zionists, which, gave, him, a, pretext, to, reject, any, further, compromise, with, the, government, the, shah, himself, was, horrified, by, the, events, of, black, friday, and, harshly, criticized, the, events, though, this, did, little, to, sway, public, perception, of, him, as, being, responsible, for, the, shooting, while, martial, law, officially, remained, in, effect, the, government, decided, not, to, break, up, any, more, demonstrations, or, strikes, in, effect, martial, law, without, there, exactly, being, martial, law, according, to, sharif, emami, instead, continuing, to, negotiate, with, protest, leaders, consequently, protest, gatherings, often, took, place, without, any, serious, intervention, by, soldiers, oil, strikes, started, in, fall, of, 1978, and, led, to, a, 4, 8, million, drop, of, crude, oil, production, every, day, which, was, about, seven, percent, of, the, world, s, supply, prices, rose, from, 13, dollars, per, barrel, in, 1979, to, 34, dollars, in, 1980, while, increased, production, from, other, countries, like, saudi, arabia, offset, the, decline, in, supply, slightly, there, was, still, a, 10, percent, drop, in, available, oil, there, were, a, variety, of, factors, influencing, the, workers, decision, to, strike, the, shah, s, regime, had, relaxed, oppression, in, 1977, giving, people, more, access, to, protest, and, organizing, at, the, same, time, the, economy, had, faltered, after, doing, better, in, the, early, 70s, the, strikes, began, when, the, workers, at, a, refinery, in, tehran, called, for, higher, wages, and, housing, allowances, the, government, ignored, the, request, causing, the, workers, to, strike, the, shah, s, government, responded, by, killing, dozens, of, strikers, in, an, event, known, as, black, friday, one, day, after, this, massacre, strikes, began, in, tehran, abadan, isfahan, shiraz, and, kermanshah, this, began, the, first, wave, of, strikes, which, savak, reports, to, include, 11, 000, workers, the, oil, strikes, of, 1978, were, imperative, to, the, iranian, revolution, s, success, as, they, put, extreme, economic, pressure, on, the, shah, s, regime, oil, revenues, are, a, significant, part, of, the, government, s, income, and, regardless, of, the, motivation, behind, those, who, strike, oil, strikes, will, always, threaten, to, destabilize, iranian, regimes, by, late, october, a, nationwide, general, strike, was, declared, with, workers, in, virtually, all, major, industries, walking, off, their, jobs, most, damagingly, in, the, oil, industry, and, the, print, media, special, strike, committees, were, set, up, throughout, major, industries, to, organize, and, coordinate, the, activities, the, shah, did, not, attempt, to, crack, down, on, strikers, but, instead, gave, them, generous, wage, increases, and, allowed, strikers, who, lived, in, government, housing, to, remain, in, their, homes, by, the, beginning, of, november, many, important, officials, in, the, shah, s, government, were, demanding, from, the, shah, forceful, measures, to, bring, the, strikers, back, to, work, hoping, to, break, khomeini, s, contacts, with, the, opposition, the, shah, pressured, the, iraqi, government, to, expel, him, from, najaf, khomeini, left, iraq, instead, moving, to, a, house, bought, by, iranian, exiles, in, neauphle, le, ch, teau, a, village, near, paris, france, the, shah, hoped, that, khomeini, would, be, cut, off, from, the, mosques, of, najaf, and, be, cut, off, from, the, protest, movement, instead, the, plan, backfired, badly, with, superior, french, telephone, and, postal, connections, compared, to, iraqi, ones, khomeini, s, supporters, flooded, iran, with, tapes, and, recordings, of, his, sermons, worse, for, the, shah, was, that, the, western, media, especially, the, british, broadcasting, corporation, bbc, immediately, put, khomeini, into, the, spotlight, khomeini, rapidly, became, a, household, name, in, the, west, portraying, himself, as, an, eastern, mystic, who, did, not, seek, power, but, instead, sought, to, free, his, people, from, oppression, many, western, media, outlets, usually, critical, of, such, claims, became, one, of, khomeini, s, most, powerful, tools, in, addition, the, media, coverage, eroded, the, influence, of, other, more, moderate, clergy, such, as, ayatollah, shariatmadari, and, ayatollah, taleghani, the, bbc, itself, later, issued, a, statement, admitting, to, having, a, critical, disposition, to, the, shah, saying, that, its, broadcasts, helped, to, change, the, collective, perception, of, the, population, in, november, secular, national, front, leader, karim, sanjabi, flew, to, paris, to, meet, khomeini, there, the, two, signed, an, agreement, for, a, draft, constitution, that, would, be, islamic, and, democratic, it, signaled, the, now, official, alliance, between, the, clergy, and, the, secular, opposition, to, help, create, a, democratic, fa, ade, khomeini, placed, westernized, figures, such, as, sadegh, ghotbzadeh, and, ebrahim, yazdi, as, the, public, spokesmen, of, the, opposition, and, never, spoke, to, the, media, of, his, intentions, to, create, a, theocracy, street, demonstrations, continued, at, full, force, with, little, response, from, the, military, by, late, october, government, officials, effectively, even, ceded, the, university, of, tehran, to, student, protesters, worse, the, opposition, was, increasingly, becoming, armed, with, weapons, firing, at, soldiers, and, attacking, banks, and, government, buildings, in, an, attempt, to, destabilize, the, country, on, 5, november, demonstrations, at, university, of, tehran, became, deadly, after, a, fight, broke, out, with, armed, soldiers, within, hours, tehran, broke, out, into, a, full, scale, riot, block, after, block, of, western, symbols, such, as, movie, theaters, and, department, stores, as, well, as, government, and, police, buildings, were, seized, looted, and, burned, the, british, embassy, in, tehran, was, partially, burned, and, vandalized, as, well, and, the, american, embassy, nearly, suffered, the, same, fate, the, event, became, known, to, foreign, observers, as, the, day, tehran, burned, many, of, the, rioters, were, young, teenage, boys, often, organized, by, the, mosques, in, southern, tehran, and, encouraged, by, their, mullahs, to, attack, and, destroy, western, and, secular, symbols, the, army, and, police, confused, about, their, orders, and, under, pressure, from, the, shah, not, to, risk, initiating, violence, effectively, gave, up, and, did, not, intervene, as, the, situation, on, the, streets, spiraled, out, of, control, many, well, known, and, reputable, figures, within, the, country, began, to, approach, the, shah, begging, him, to, stop, the, chaos, on, 6, november, the, shah, dismissed, sharif, emami, from, the, post, of, prime, minister, and, chose, to, appoint, a, military, government, in, its, place, the, shah, chose, general, gholam, reza, azhari, to, be, prime, minister, because, of, his, mild, mannered, approach, to, the, situation, the, cabinet, he, would, choose, was, a, military, cabinet, in, name, only, and, consisted, primarily, of, civilian, leaders, the, same, day, the, shah, made, a, speech, on, iranian, television, he, referred, to, himself, as, padeshah, master, king, instead, of, the, more, grandiose, shahanshah, king, of, kings, which, he, insisted, on, being, called, previously, in, his, speech, he, stated, i, have, heard, the, voice, of, your, revolution, this, revolution, cannot, but, be, supported, by, me, the, king, of, iran, he, apologized, for, mistakes, that, were, committed, during, his, reign, and, promised, to, ensure, that, corruption, would, no, longer, exist, he, stated, he, would, begin, to, work, with, the, opposition, to, bring, democracy, and, would, form, a, coalition, government, in, effect, the, shah, intended, to, restrain, the, military, government, which, he, described, as, a, temporary, caretaker, government, from, carrying, out, a, full, crackdown, the, speech, backfired, when, the, revolutionaries, sensed, weakness, from, the, shah, and, smelled, blood, khomeini, announced, that, there, would, be, no, reconciliation, with, the, shah, and, called, on, all, iranians, to, overthrow, him, military, authorities, declared, martial, law, in, khuzestan, province, iran, s, main, oil, producing, province, and, deployed, troops, to, its, oil, facilities, navy, personnel, were, also, used, as, strikebreakers, in, the, oil, industry, street, marches, declined, and, oil, production, began, increasing, once, again, nearly, reaching, pre, revolutionary, levels, in, a, symbolic, blow, to, the, opposition, karim, sanjabi, who, had, visited, khomeini, in, paris, was, arrested, upon, his, return, to, iran, however, the, government, still, continued, the, policy, of, appeasement, and, negotiation, the, shah, ordered, the, arrest, of, 100, officials, from, his, own, government, for, charges, of, corruption, including, former, prime, minister, amir, abbas, hoveyda, and, former, savak, head, nematollah, nassiri, khomeini, condemned, the, military, government, and, called, for, continued, protests, he, and, the, protest, organizers, planned, a, series, of, escalating, protests, during, the, holy, islamic, month, of, muharram, to, culminate, with, massive, protests, on, the, days, of, tasu, a, and, ashura, the, latter, commemorating, the, martyrdom, of, imam, husayn, ibn, ali, the, third, shia, muslim, imam, while, the, military, authorities, banned, street, demonstrations, and, extended, the, curfew, the, shah, faced, deep, misgivings, about, the, potential, violence, on, 2, december, 1978, the, muharram, protests, began, named, for, the, islamic, month, they, began, in, the, muharram, protests, were, impressively, huge, and, pivotal, over, two, million, protesters, many, of, whom, were, teenagers, proselytized, by, the, mullahs, from, the, mosques, of, southern, tehran, took, to, the, streets, crowding, shahyad, square, protesters, frequently, went, out, at, night, defying, the, set, curfew, often, taking, to, rooftops, and, shouting, allahu, akbar, god, is, great, according, to, one, witness, many, of, the, clashes, on, the, street, had, an, air, of, playfulness, rather, than, seriousness, with, security, forces, using, kid, gloves, against, the, opposition, nevertheless, the, government, reported, at, least, 12, opposition, deaths, the, protesters, demanded, that, shah, mohammad, reza, pahlavi, step, down, from, power, and, that, grand, ayatollah, ruhollah, khomeini, be, returned, from, exile, the, protests, grew, incredibly, fast, reaching, between, six, million, and, nine, million, in, strength, in, the, first, week, about, 5, of, the, population, had, taken, to, the, streets, in, the, muharram, protests, both, beginning, and, ending, in, the, month, of, muharram, the, protests, succeeded, and, the, shah, stepped, down, from, power, later, that, month, after, the, success, of, what, would, become, known, as, a, revolution, ayatollah, khomeini, returned, to, iran, as, its, religious, and, political, leader, for, life, khomeini, had, been, an, opposition, leader, to, shah, for, many, years, rising, to, prominence, after, the, death, of, his, mentor, renowned, scholar, yazdi, ha, iri, in, the, 1930s, even, in, his, years, in, exile, khomeini, remained, relevant, in, iran, supporting, the, protests, from, beyond, iran, s, borders, he, proclaimed, that, freedom, and, liberation, from, the, bonds, of, imperialism, was, imminent, as, the, days, of, tasu, a, and, ashura, 10, and, 11, december, approached, to, prevent, a, deadly, showdown, the, shah, began, to, draw, back, in, negotiations, with, ayatollah, shariatmadari, the, shah, ordered, the, release, of, 120, political, prisoners, and, karim, sanjabi, and, on, 8, december, revoked, the, ban, on, street, demonstrations, permits, were, issued, for, the, marchers, and, troops, were, removed, from, the, procession, s, path, in, turn, shariatmadari, pledged, that, to, make, sure, that, there, would, be, no, violence, during, the, demonstrations, on, 10, and, 11, december, 1978, the, days, of, tasu, a, and, ashura, between, 6, and, 9, million, anti, shah, demonstrators, marched, throughout, iran, according, to, one, historian, even, discounting, for, exaggeration, these, figures, may, represent, the, largest, protest, event, in, history, the, marches, were, led, by, ayatollah, taleghani, and, national, front, leader, karim, sanjabi, thus, symbolizing, the, unity, of, the, secular, and, religious, opposition, the, mullahs, and, bazaaris, effectively, policed, the, gathering, and, protesters, who, attempted, to, initiate, violence, were, restrained, more, than, 10, of, the, country, marched, in, anti, shah, demonstrations, on, the, two, days, possibly, a, higher, percentage, than, any, previous, revolution, it, is, rare, for, a, revolution, to, involve, as, much, as, 1, percent, of, a, country, s, population, the, french, russian, and, romanian, revolutions, may, have, passed, the, 1, percent, mark, much, of, iranian, society, was, in, euphoria, about, the, coming, revolution, secular, and, leftist, politicians, piled, onto, the, movement, hoping, to, gain, power, in, the, aftermath, ignoring, the, fact, that, khomeini, was, the, very, antithesis, to, all, of, the, positions, they, supported, while, it, was, increasingly, clear, to, more, secular, iranians, that, khomeini, was, not, a, liberal, he, was, widely, perceived, as, a, figurehead, and, that, power, would, eventually, be, handed, to, the, secular, groups, the, military, leadership, was, increasingly, paralyzed, by, indecision, and, rank, and, file, soldiers, were, demoralized, having, been, forced, to, confront, demonstrators, while, prohibited, from, using, their, own, weapons, and, being, condemned, by, the, shah, if, they, did, increasingly, khomeini, called, on, the, soldiers, of, the, armed, forces, to, defect, to, the, opposition, revolutionaries, gave, flowers, and, civilian, clothes, to, deserters, while, threatening, retribution, to, those, who, stayed, on, 11, december, a, dozen, officers, were, shot, dead, by, their, own, troops, at, tehran, s, lavizan, barracks, fearing, further, mutinies, many, soldiers, were, returned, to, their, barracks, mashhad, the, second, largest, city, in, iran, was, abandoned, to, the, protesters, and, in, many, provincial, towns, demonstrators, were, effectively, in, control, the, carter, administration, increasingly, became, locked, in, a, debate, about, continued, support, for, the, monarchy, as, early, as, november, ambassador, william, sullivan, sent, a, telegram, to, carter, the, thinking, the, unthinkable, telegram, the, telegram, effectively, declared, his, belief, that, the, shah, would, not, survive, the, protests, and, that, the, us, should, consider, withdrawing, its, support, for, his, government, and, persuading, the, monarch, to, abdicate, the, united, states, would, then, help, assemble, a, coalition, of, pro, western, military, officers, middle, class, professionals, and, moderate, clergy, with, khomeini, installed, as, a, gandhi, like, spiritual, leader, the, telegram, touched, off, a, vigorous, debate, in, the, american, cabinet, with, some, such, as, national, security, advisor, zbigniew, brzezinski, rejecting, it, outright, secretary, of, state, cyrus, vance, rejected, a, military, crackdown, he, and, his, supporters, believed, in, the, moderate, and, progressive, intentions, of, khomeini, and, his, circle, increasing, contact, was, established, with, the, pro, khomeini, camp, based, on, the, revolutionaries, responses, some, american, officials, especially, ambassador, sullivan, felt, that, khomeini, was, genuinely, intent, on, creating, a, democracy, according, to, historian, abbas, milani, this, resulted, in, the, united, states, effectively, helping, to, facilitate, khomeini, s, rise, to, power, the, shah, began, to, search, for, a, new, prime, minister, one, who, was, a, civilian, and, a, member, of, the, opposition, on, 28, december, he, secured, an, agreement, with, another, major, national, front, figure, shahpour, bakhtiar, bakhtiar, would, be, appointed, prime, minister, a, return, to, civilian, rule, while, the, shah, and, his, family, would, leave, the, country, his, royal, duties, would, be, carried, out, by, a, regency, council, and, three, months, after, his, departure, a, referendum, would, be, submitted, to, the, people, deciding, on, whether, iran, would, remain, a, monarchy, or, become, a, republic, a, former, opponent, of, the, shah, bakhtiar, became, motivated, to, join, the, government, because, he, was, increasingly, aware, of, khomeini, s, intentions, to, implement, hard, line, religious, rule, rather, than, a, democracy, karim, sanjabi, immediately, expelled, bakhtiar, from, the, national, front, and, bakhtiar, was, denounced, by, khomeini, who, declared, that, acceptance, of, his, government, was, the, equivalent, of, obedience, to, false, gods, the, shah, hoping, to, see, bakhtiar, established, kept, delaying, his, departure, consequently, to, the, iranian, public, bakhtiar, was, seen, as, the, shah, s, last, prime, minister, undermining, his, support, american, general, robert, huyser, the, deputy, commander, of, nato, entered, iran, while, the, option, of, a, pro, shah, military, coup, still, was, a, possibility, huyser, met, with, military, leaders, but, not, the, shah, and, established, meetings, between, them, and, khomeini, allies, for, the, purpose, of, agreeing, on, bakhtiar, s, transitional, government, ambassador, sullivan, disagreed, and, attempted, to, pressure, huyser, to, ignore, the, military, and, work, directly, with, khomeini, s, opposition, nevertheless, huyser, won, out, and, continued, to, work, with, both, the, military, and, opposition, he, left, iran, on, 3, february, the, shah, was, privately, embittered, by, huyser, s, mission, and, felt, that, the, united, states, no, longer, wanted, him, in, power, on, the, morning, of, 16, january, 1979, bakhtiar, was, officially, appointed, prime, minister, the, same, day, a, tearful, shah, and, his, family, left, iran, for, exile, in, egypt, never, to, return, when, news, of, the, shah, s, departure, was, announced, there, were, spontaneous, scenes, of, joy, throughout, the, country, millions, poured, onto, the, streets, and, virtually, every, remaining, sign, of, the, monarchy, was, torn, down, by, the, crowds, bakhtiar, dissolved, savak, and, freed, all, remaining, political, prisoners, he, ordered, the, army, to, allow, mass, demonstrations, promised, free, elections, and, invited, the, revolutionaries, into, a, government, of, national, unity, bakhtiar, invited, khomeini, back, to, iran, with, the, intention, of, creating, a, vatican, like, state, in, the, holy, city, of, qom, declaring, that, we, will, soon, have, the, honor, of, welcoming, home, the, ayatollah, khomeini, on, 1, february, 1979, khomeini, returned, to, tehran, in, a, chartered, air, france, boeing, 747, the, welcoming, crowd, of, several, million, iranians, was, so, large, he, was, forced, to, take, a, helicopter, after, the, car, taking, him, from, the, airport, was, overwhelmed, by, an, enthusiastic, welcoming, crowd, khomeini, was, now, not, only, the, undisputed, leader, of, the, revolution, he, had, become, what, some, called, a, semi, divine, figure, greeted, as, he, descended, from, his, airplane, with, cries, of, khomeini, o, imam, we, salute, you, peace, be, upon, you, crowds, were, now, known, to, chant, islam, islam, khomeini, we, will, follow, you, and, even, khomeini, for, king, when, asked, by, a, reporter, how, he, felt, returning, to, his, home, country, after, a, long, exile, khomeini, replied, nothing, on, the, day, of, his, arrival, khomeini, made, clear, his, rejection, of, bakhtiar, s, government, in, a, speech, promising, i, shall, kick, their, teeth, in, i, appoint, the, government, i, appoint, the, government, in, support, of, this, nation, on, 5, february, at, his, headquarters, in, the, refah, school, in, southern, tehran, he, declared, a, provisional, revolutionary, government, appointed, opposition, leader, mehdi, bazargan, from, the, religious, nationalist, freedom, movement, affiliated, with, the, national, front, as, his, own, prime, minister, and, commanded, iranians, to, obey, bazargan, as, a, religious, duty, hrough, the, guardianship, that, i, have, from, the, holy, lawgiver, i, hereby, pronounce, bazargan, as, the, ruler, and, since, i, have, appointed, him, he, must, be, obeyed, the, nation, must, obey, him, this, is, not, an, ordinary, government, it, is, a, government, based, on, the, sharia, opposing, this, government, means, opposing, the, sharia, of, islam, revolt, against, god, s, government, is, a, revolt, against, god, revolt, against, god, is, blasphemy, angered, bakhtiar, made, a, speech, of, his, own, reaffirming, himself, as, the, legitimate, leader, he, declared, that, iran, has, one, government, more, than, this, is, intolerable, either, for, me, or, for, you, or, for, any, other, iranian, as, a, muslim, i, had, not, heard, that, jihad, refers, to, one, muslim, against, other, muslims, i, will, not, give, permission, to, ayatollah, khomeini, to, form, an, interim, government, in, life, there, comes, a, time, when, one, must, stand, firm, and, say, no, i, have, never, seen, a, book, about, an, islamic, republic, neither, has, anyone, else, for, that, matter, some, of, the, people, surrounding, the, ayatollah, are, like, violent, vultures, the, clergy, should, go, to, qom, and, build, a, wall, around, themselves, and, create, their, own, vatican, tensions, between, the, two, rival, governments, increased, rapidly, to, demonstrate, his, support, khomeini, called, for, demonstrators, to, occupy, the, streets, throughout, the, country, he, also, sent, a, letter, to, american, officials, warning, them, to, withdraw, support, for, bakhtiar, bakhtiar, became, increasingly, isolated, with, members, of, the, government, including, the, entire, regency, council, defecting, to, khomeini, the, military, was, crumbling, with, its, leadership, completely, paralyzed, unsure, of, whether, to, support, bakhtiar, or, act, on, their, own, and, rank, and, file, soldiers, either, demoralized, or, deserting, on, 9, february, a, rebellion, of, pro, khomeini, air, force, technicians, broke, out, at, the, doshan, tappeh, air, base, a, unit, of, the, pro, shah, immortal, guards, attempted, to, apprehend, the, rebels, and, an, armed, battle, broke, out, soon, large, crowds, took, to, the, streets, building, barricades, and, supporting, the, rebels, while, islamic, marxist, guerillas, with, their, weapons, joined, in, support, the, armed, rebels, attacked, a, weapons, factory, capturing, nearly, 50, 000, machine, guns, and, distributing, them, to, civilians, who, joined, in, the, fighting, the, rebels, began, storming, police, stations, and, military, bases, throughout, tehran, the, city, s, martial, law, commander, general, mehdi, rahimi, decided, not, to, use, his, 30, 000, loyal, immortal, guards, to, crush, the, rebellion, for, fear, of, producing, civilian, casualties, the, final, collapse, of, the, provisional, non, islamist, government, came, at, 2, pm, on, 11, february, when, the, supreme, military, council, declared, itself, neutral, in, the, current, political, disputes, in, order, to, prevent, further, disorder, and, bloodshed, all, military, personnel, were, ordered, back, to, their, bases, effectively, yielding, control, of, the, entire, country, to, khomeini, revolutionaries, took, over, government, buildings, tv, and, radio, stations, and, palaces, of, the, pahlavi, dynasty, marking, the, end, of, the, monarchy, in, iran, bakhtiar, escaped, the, palace, under, a, hail, of, bullets, fleeing, iran, in, disguise, he, was, later, assassinated, by, an, agent, of, the, islamic, republic, in, 1991, in, paris, this, period, from, 1, to, 11, february, is, celebrated, every, year, in, iran, as, the, decade, of, fajr, 11, february, is, islamic, revolution, s, victory, day, a, national, holiday, with, state, sponsored, demonstrations, in, every, city, some, sources, such, as, emadeddin, baghi, a, researcher, at, the, martyrs, foundation, claim, 2, 781, protesters, and, revolutionaries, were, killed, in, 1978, 79, during, the, revolution, khomeini, reported, of, a, much, larger, number, he, said, that, 60, 000, men, women, and, children, were, martyred, by, the, shah, s, regime, in, reference, to, this, 60, 000, figure, the, military, historian, spencer, c, tucker, notes, that, khomeini, s, regime, grossly, overstated, the, revolution, s, death, toll, for, propaganda, purposes, tucker, explains, that, the, consensus, of, historians, regarding, estimated, deaths, during, the, iranian, revolution, from, january, 1978, to, february, 1979, numbers, between, 532, and, 2, 781, according, to, the, historian, ervand, abrahamian, the, number, executed, by, revolutionary, courts, as, the, revolution, was, consolidated, 8, 000, opponents, between, june, 1981, and, june, 1985, exceeded, those, killed, by, the, royalist, government, trying, to, stop, the, revolution, according, to, tucker, s, estimations, in, the, period, of, 1980, to, 1985, between, 25, 000, and, 40, 000, iranians, were, arrested, 15, 000, iranians, were, tried, and, between, 8, 000, and, 9, 500, iranians, were, executed, the, songs, most, closely, associated, with, the, revolution, are, epic, ballads, composed, during, and, in, support, of, the, islamic, revolution, and, in, opposition, to, the, pahlavi, dynasty, before, the, revolution, was, consolidated, these, chants, were, made, by, various, political, supporters, and, were, often, recorded, on, cassette, tapes, in, underground, and, home, studios, in, schools, these, songs, were, sung, by, students, as, part, of, the, celebrations, of, fajr, decades, iran, iran, or, allah, allah, chants, are, famous, revolutionary, songs, the, iranian, revolution, was, a, gendered, revolution, much, of, the, new, regime, s, rhetoric, was, centered, on, the, position, of, women, in, society, beyond, rhetoric, thousands, of, women, were, also, heavily, mobilized, in, the, revolution, itself, and, different, groups, of, women, actively, participated, alongside, their, male, counterparts, not, only, participating, through, voting, women, also, contributed, to, the, revolution, through, marches, demonstrations, and, chanting, slogans, women, were, involved, in, caring, for, the, wounded, including, doctors, who, responded, to, calls, for, help, and, opened, their, homes, for, those, who, needed, assistance, while, women, themselves, were, often, killed, tortured, arrested, or, injured, and, some, were, involved, in, guerilla, activities, most, contributed, in, non, violent, ways, many, women, were, instrumental, not, only, in, being, involved, in, the, revolution, themselves, but, in, mobilizing, men, and, other, non, political, women, many, women, protested, while, carrying, children, and, their, presence, was, one, of, the, main, reasons, for, disarming, soldiers, who, were, there, on, behalf, of, the, regime, who, were, ordered, to, shoot, if, necessary, ayatollah, khomeini, asserted, that, you, ladies, here, have, proved, that, you, are, at, the, forefront, of, this, movement, you, have, a, great, share, in, our, islamic, movement, the, future, of, our, country, depends, on, your, support, he, invoked, the, image, of, the, hijab, as, a, symbol, of, the, revolution, saying, that, a, nation, whose, respected, women, demonstrate, in, modest, garb, to, express, their, disgust, with, the, shah, s, regime, such, a, nation, will, be, victorious, he, also, said, that, women, from, all, levels, of, society, took, part, in, the, recent, demonstrations, which, we, are, calling, the, referendum, of, the, streets, women, fought, side, by, side, with, men, in, the, struggle, for, their, independence, and, their, liberty, khomeini, pleaded, for, women, to, participate, in, anti, shah, demonstrations, in, various, cities, furthermore, women, later, responded, to, khomeini, s, urgings, to, vote, in, favor, of, the, islamic, republic, and, the, new, constitution, women, were, so, pivotal, to, the, revolution, that, in, response, to, a, suggestion, from, a, top, aide, to, ban, women, from, coming, to, group, audience, khomeini, said, i, threw, the, shah, out, with, these, women, there, s, no, problem, in, their, coming, after, the, revolution, khomeini, credited, much, of, the, success, of, the, movement, to, women, even, commending, the, women, for, mobilizing, men, you, ladies, have, proved, that, you, are, in, the, vanguard, of, the, movement, you, have, proved, that, you, lead, the, men, men, get, their, inspiration, from, you, the, men, of, iran, have, learnt, lessons, from, the, honourable, ladies, of, iran, you, are, in, the, vanguard, of, the, movement, it, has, been, argued, that, khomeini, and, his, fellow, leaders, danced, around, the, issue, of, women, s, rights, and, rather, focused, their, rhetoric, on, mobilizing, women, through, encouraging, them, to, participate, in, protests, and, fueling, their, anti, shah, sentiments, the, contributions, of, women, to, the, revolutions, and, the, intentions, behind, these, contributions, are, complex, and, layered, the, motivations, of, women, for, being, part, of, the, revolutions, were, complex, and, varied, among, a, plethora, of, religious, political, and, economic, reasons, and, women, participating, were, from, various, classes, and, backgrounds, many, western, educated, upper, middle, class, women, from, secular, urban, and, professional, families, were, involved, as, well, as, many, women, from, working, class, and, rural, backgrounds, there, were, groups, as, varied, as, the, fida, iyan, i, khalq, and, the, mujahedin, were, functioning, as, guerrilla, units, during, the, revolutions, in, opposition, to, the, shah, s, regime, there, were, also, other, groups, of, women, with, various, agendas, that, sometimes, converged, and, sometimes, diverged, from, the, islamic, republic, s, political, positions, for, example, organized, feminism, which, was, around, since, the, pahlavi, dynasty, joined, the, revolutionary, movement, after, the, shah, dropped, the, cabinet, position, on, women, s, affairs, to, appease, the, islamists, members, of, the, women, s, organization, of, iran, marched, in, support, for, the, revolution, and, it, was, important, that, women, very, much, linked, to, the, government, also, turned, against, the, shah, s, regime, yet, there, was, some, tension, later, between, feminists, dress, and, the, revolution, s, stance, on, women, s, clothing, and, they, began, to, feel, uncomfortable, at, opposition, events, some, argue, that, this, politicization, and, mobilization, of, women, made, it, difficult, for, the, new, regime, to, push, them, out, of, the, public, and, political, spheres, the, revolution, resulted, in, an, unprecedented, opening, for, iranian, women, into, politics, mostly, through, demonstrations, and, voting, and, some, authors, argue, that, this, had, a, lasting, impact, on, iranian, women, s, political, participation, and, role, in, the, public, sphere, some, women, were, also, part, of, the, inner, circle, of, the, leaders, of, the, new, regime, such, as, marzieh, hadidchi, other, than, the, politicization, of, women, there, were, particular, circumstances, during, the, revolution, which, pushed, women, into, being, involved, with, politics, for, example, the, combination, of, martial, law, with, its, curfew, hours, and, the, closing, down, of, shops, and, workplaces, together, with, the, cold, of, the, fall, and, winter, months, resulted, in, the, centers, of, political, discussion, often, being, within, the, home, women, engaged, with, news, and, media, as, well, as, political, discussions, alongside, their, male, counterparts, as, the, revolution, was, the, only, topic, of, interest, to, anyone, regardless, of, age, or, sex, during, 1978, and, 1979, there, were, many, gatherings, in, women, s, homes, where, they, exchanged, interpersonal, news, and, anecdotes, these, personal, accounts, were, valuable, in, a, time, where, the, official, coverage, of, news, was, not, trusted, by, many, people, women, who, were, activists, religious, women, and, women, dissatisfied, with, the, regime, were, able, to, unite, under, the, anti, shah, umbrella, however, women, were, not, united, in, their, opinions, of, the, revolution, and, its, outcome, as, much, as, they, were, not, united, in, their, reasons, for, joining, the, revolution, despite, this, mobilization, and, high, participation, rate, of, women, they, were, still, kept, out, of, leadership, positions, which, were, exclusive, to, men, women, are, thought, to, be, part, of, the, rank, and, file, rather, than, the, elite, strata, of, the, revolution, while, there, has, been, some, academic, literature, exploring, individual, narratives, of, women, on, the, revolution, most, of, the, academic, work, produced, focuses, on, the, effect, of, the, revolution, on, women, rather, than, the, role, of, iranian, women, during, the, revolution, scholar, guity, nashat, highlights, this, neglected, aspect, of, the, revolution, although, women, s, participation, in, the, events, leading, to, the, 11, february, revolution, was, instrumental, in, its, success, most, studies, have, not, addressed, the, reasons, for, their, involvement, or, their, contribution, janet, baur, argues, the, necessity, of, examining, the, daily, lives, of, women, their, living, conditions, and, their, relationship, to, other, groups, to, understand, their, participation, in, the, socio, political, events, of, the, revolution, she, further, explains, that, the, cultural, ideological, social, and, material, factors, shaping, the, social, life, and, class, differences, in, the, period, just, prior, to, the, revolution, need, to, be, studied, to, understand, how, the, iranian, women, s, social, consciousness, developed, and, how, it, led, them, to, take, part, in, public, protests, caroline, m, brooks, argues, that, women, were, left, to, express, their, concerns, through, the, protest, rather, than, in, the, majlis, thus, this, created, a, dangerous, bargaining, position, for, activist, women, since, rather, than, arguing, their, position, through, intellect, they, were, only, able, to, argue, by, numbers, in, the, streets, and, be, repelled, by, force, there, are, some, contesting, understandings, in, academic, literature, regarding, the, reasons, behind, the, mobilization, of, women, while, some, argue, that, the, micro, level, actions, of, women, can, be, understood, through, religious, and, political, ideologies, others, argue, that, it, is, in, fact, the, effect, of, manipulations, of, information, symbols, and, context, which, should, be, studied, from, early, 1979, to, either, 1982, or, 1983, iran, was, in, a, revolutionary, crisis, mode, after, the, system, of, despotic, monarchy, had, been, overthrown, the, economy, and, the, apparatus, of, government, had, collapsed, and, military, and, security, forces, were, in, disarray, yet, by, 1982, khomeini, and, his, supporters, had, crushed, the, rival, factions, defeated, local, rebellions, and, consolidated, power, at, the, same, time, events, that, made, up, both, the, crisis, and, its, resolution, were, the, iran, hostage, crisis, the, invasion, of, iran, by, saddam, hussein, s, iraq, and, the, presidency, of, abolhassan, banisadr, some, observers, believe, what, began, as, an, authentic, and, anti, dictatorial, popular, revolution, based, on, a, broad, coalition, of, all, anti, shah, forces, was, soon, transformed, into, an, islamic, fundamentalist, power, grab, and, that, except, for, his, core, supporters, the, members, of, the, coalition, thought, khomeini, intended, to, be, more, of, a, spiritual, guide, than, a, ruler, khomeini, was, in, his, mid, 70s, never, held, public, office, had, been, out, of, iran, for, more, than, a, decade, and, told, questioners, the, religious, dignitaries, do, not, want, to, rule, however, nobody, could, deny, the, unanimous, central, role, of, the, imam, and, the, other, factions, were, too, small, to, have, any, real, impact, another, view, is, khomeini, had, overwhelming, ideological, political, and, organizational, hegemony, and, non, theocratic, groups, never, seriously, challenged, khomeini, s, movement, in, popular, support, supporters, of, the, new, rule, themselves, have, claimed, that, iranians, who, opposed, khomeini, were, fifth, columnists, led, by, foreign, countries, attempting, to, overthrow, the, iranian, government, khomeini, and, his, loyalists, in, the, revolutionary, organizations, implemented, khomeini, s, velayat, e, faqih, design, for, an, islamic, republic, led, by, himself, as, supreme, leader, by, exploiting, temporary, allies, such, as, mehdi, bazargan, s, provisional, government, of, iran, whom, they, later, eliminated, from, iran, s, political, stage, one, by, one, political, militant, islam, portal, the, most, important, bodies, of, the, revolution, were, the, revolutionary, council, the, revolutionary, guards, revolutionary, tribunals, islamic, republican, party, and, revolutionary, committees, komitehs, while, the, moderate, bazargan, and, his, government, temporarily, reassured, the, middle, class, it, became, apparent, they, did, not, have, power, over, the, khomeinist, revolutionary, bodies, particularly, the, revolutionary, council, the, real, power, in, the, revolutionary, state, and, later, the, islamic, republican, party, inevitably, the, overlapping, authority, of, the, revolutionary, council, which, had, the, power, to, pass, laws, and, bazargan, s, government, was, a, source, of, conflict, despite, the, fact, that, both, had, been, approved, by, and, or, put, in, place, by, khomeini, this, conflict, lasted, only, a, few, months, however, the, provisional, government, fell, shortly, after, american, embassy, officials, were,

the, overthrow, of, monarchies, in, the, region, and, for, them, to, be, replaced, by, islamic, republics, this, alarmed, many, of, iran, s, neighbours, particularly, kuwait, iraq, and, saudi, arabia, as, well, as, western, nations, dependent, on, middle, eastern, oil, for, their, energy, needs, in, september, 1980, iraq, took, advantage, of, the, febrile, situation, and, invaded, iran, at, the, centre, of, iraq, s, objectives, was, the, annexation, of, the, east, bank, of, the, shaat, al, arab, waterway, that, makes, up, part, of, the, border, between, the, two, nations, and, which, had, been, the, site, of, numerous, border, skirmishes, between, the, two, countries, going, back, to, the, late, 1960s, the, president, of, iraq, saddam, hussein, also, wanted, to, annex, the, iranian, province, of, khuzestan, substantially, populated, by, iranian, arabs, there, was, also, concern, that, a, shia, centric, revolution, in, iran, may, stimulate, a, similar, uprising, in, iraq, where, the, country, s, sunni, minority, ruled, over, the, shia, majority, hussein, was, confident, that, with, iraq, s, armed, forces, being, well, equipped, with, new, technology, and, with, high, morale, would, enjoy, a, decisive, strategic, advantage, against, an, iranian, military, that, had, recently, had, much, of, its, command, officers, purged, following, the, revolution, iran, was, also, struggling, to, find, replacement, parts, for, much, of, its, us, and, british, supplied, equipment, hussein, believed, that, victory, would, therefore, come, swiftly, however, iran, was, galvanized, by, the, invasion, and, the, populace, of, iran, rallied, behind, their, new, government, in, an, effort, to, repel, the, invaders, after, some, early, successes, the, iraqi, invasion, stalled, and, was, then, repelled, and, by, 1982, iran, had, recaptured, almost, all, of, its, territories, in, june, 1982, with, iraqi, forces, all, but, expelled, from, iranian, territory, the, iraqi, government, offered, a, ceasefire, this, was, rejected, by, khomeini, who, declared, that, the, only, condition, for, peace, was, that, the, regime, in, baghdad, must, fall, and, must, be, replaced, by, an, islamic, republic, the, war, would, continue, for, another, six, years, during, which, time, countries, like, saudi, arabia, kuwait, and, other, gulf, states, provided, financial, assistance, to, iraq, in, an, effort, to, prevent, an, iranian, victory, even, though, their, relations, with, iraq, were, often, hostile, kuwait, itself, was, invaded, by, iraq, two, years, after, the, peace, agreement, between, iraq, and, iran, was, signed, the, war, served, in, part, as, an, opportunity, for, the, government, to, strengthen, revolutionary, ardour, and, revolutionary, groups, the, revolutionary, guard, and, committees, at, the, expense, of, its, remaining, allies, turned, opponents, such, as, the, mek, while, enormously, costly, and, destructive, the, war, rejuvenate, the, drive, for, national, unity, and, islamic, revolution, and, inhibited, fractious, debate, and, dispute, in, iran, the, islamic, republic, of, iran, experienced, difficult, relations, with, some, western, countries, especially, the, united, states, and, the, eastern, bloc, nations, led, by, the, soviet, union, iran, was, under, constant, us, unilateral, sanctions, which, were, tightened, under, the, presidency, of, bill, clinton, most, european, countries, despite, their, significant, investments, within, iran, stood, in, solidarity, with, the, united, states, and, also, imposed, economic, sanctions, on, the, theocratic, regime, britain, suspended, all, diplomatic, relations, with, iran, and, did, not, re, open, their, embassy, in, tehran, until, 1988, the, european, country,

treaty, organization, relations, with, the, ussr, became, strained, as, well, after, the, soviet, government, condemned, khomeini, s, repression, of, certain, minorities, after, the, revolution, diplomatic, relations, between, iran, and, the, apartheid, government, of, south, africa, were, completely, severed, following, khomeini, s, rise, to, power, israel, had, relations, with, iran, under, the, shah, but, relations, were, cut, on, 18, february, 1979, when, iran, adopted, an, anti, zionist, stance, the, former, israeli, embassy, in, tehran, was, handed, over, to, the, plo, and, iran, has, allied, itself, with, several, anti, israeli, islamist, militant, groups, since, after, the, u, s, sanctions, were, tightened, and, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, the, russian, federation, and, the, people, s, republic, of, china, became, the, main, principal, allies, for, iran, relations, between, the, two, countries, improved, after, vladimir, putin, took, office, in, 2000, and, increasingly, warmer, in, recent, years, following, an, international, backlash, over, the, annexation, of, crimea, in, 2014, which, led, to, sanctions, by, the, western, powers, russia, had, sought, iran, on, expanding, arms, trade, over, the, past, three, decades, especially, with, the, cooperation, with, the, assad, government, during, the, syrian, civil, war, iran, also, began, its, economic, cooperation, with, china, that, includes, political, strategic, and, economic, components, between, the, two, nations, in, the, muslim, world, particularly, in, its, early, years, the, revolution, inspired, enormous, enthusiasm, and, redoubled, opposition, to, western, imperialism, intervention, and, influence, islamist, insurgents, rose, in, saudi, arabia, 1979, egypt, 1981, syria, 1982, and, lebanon, 1983, in, pakistan, it, has, been, noted, that, the, press, was, largely, favorable, towards, the, new, government, the, islamist, parties, were, even, more, enthusiastic, while, the, ruler, general, zia, ul, haq, himself, on, an, islamization, drive, since, he, took, power, in, 1977, talked, of, simultaneous, triumph, of, islamic, ideology, in, both, our, countries, and, that, khomeini, is, a, symbol, of, islamic, insurgence, some, american, analysts, noted, that, at, this, point, khomeini, s, influence, and, prestige, in, pakistan, was, greater, than, zia, ul, haq, s, himself, after, khomeini, claimed, that, americans, were, behind, the, 1979, grand, mosque, seizure, student, protesters, from, the, quaid, e, azam, university, in, islamabad, attacked, the, us, embassy, setting, it, on, fire, and, taking, hostages, while, the, crisis, was, quickly, defused, by, the, pakistan, military, the, next, day, before, some, 120, pakistani, army, officers, stationed, in, iran, on, the, road, to, hajj, khomeini, said, it, is, a, cause, of, joy, that, all, pakistan, has, risen, against, the, united, states, and, the, struggle, is, not, that, of, the, us, and, iran, but, the, entire, world, of, disbelief, and, the, world, of, islam, according, to, journalist, yaroslav, trofimov, the, pakistani, officers, many, of, whom, had, graduated, from, western, military,
