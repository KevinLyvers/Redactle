political, movements, in, 1950s, included, the, suppression, of, counter, revolutionaries, the, three, anti, and, five, anti, campaigns, and, the, sufan, movement, each, of, which, resulted, in, a, large, number, of, deaths, nationwide, mao, zedong, believed, that, socialism, would, eventually, triumph, over, all, other, ideologies, and, following, the, first, five, year, plan, based, on, a, soviet, style, centrally, controlled, economy, mao, took, on, the, ambitious, project, of, the, great, leap, forward, in, 1958, beginning, an, unprecedented, process, of, collectivisation, in, rural, areas, the, people, s, commune, mao, urged, the, use, of, communally, organised, iron, smelters, to, increase, steel, production, pulling, workers, off, of, agricultural, labor, to, the, point, that, large, amounts, of, crops, rotted, unharvested, mao, decided, to, continue, to, advocate, these, smelters, despite, a, visit, to, a, factory, steel, mill, which, proved, to, him, that, high, quality, steel, could, only, be, produced, in, a, factory, he, thought, that, ending, the, program, would, dampen, peasant, enthusiasm, for, his, political, mobilisation, the, great, leap, forward, the, implementation, of, maoism, thought, in, china, may, have, been, responsible, for, the, deadliest, famine, in, human, history, in, which, 15, 55, million, people, died, due, to, starvation, and, epidemics, by, the, end, of, 1961, the, birth, rate, was, nearly, cut, in, half, because, of, malnutrition, in, 1958, the, xunhua, uprising, broke, out, and, in, 1959, a, major, uprising, erupted, in, tibet, resulting, in, the, deaths, of, tens, of, thousands, of, tibetans, and, the, dalai, lama, went, into, exile, afterwards, mao, s, failure, with, the, leap, reduced, his, power, in, government, whose, administrative, duties, fell, to, president, liu, shaoqi, and, deng, xiaoping, especially, after, the, seven, thousand, cadres, conference, in, early, 1962, the, power, struggle, between, mao, zedong, and, liu, shaoqi, together, with, deng, xiaoping, began, after, 1962, the, socialist, education, movement, was, launched, by, mao, from, 1963, to, 1965, as, a, result, much, more, successful, was, the, two, bombs, one, satellite, program, launched, in, 1958, with, the, help, at, first, of, moscow, it, used, leading, scientists, who, returned, to, mainland, china, from, abroad, including, qian, xuesen, deng, jiaxian, and, qian, sanqiang, china, s, first, atomic, bomb, nuclear, missile, hydrogen, bomb, and, artificial, satellite, were, all, successfully, developed, by, 1970, however, the, program, had, been, seriously, affected, by, the, great, leap, forward, and, the, cultural, revolution, after, the, failure, of, the, great, leap, forward, china, s, leadership, slowed, the, pace, of, industrialization, 3, it, invested, more, on, in, china, s, coastal, regions, and, focused, on, the, production, of, consumer, goods, 3, after, an, april, 1964, general, staff, report, concluded, that, the, concentration, of, china, s, industry, in, its, major, coastal, cities, made, it, vulnerable, to, attack, by, foreign, powers, mao, argued, for, the, development, of, basic, industry, and, national, defense, industry, in, protected, locations, in, china, s, interior, 4, 54, this, resulted, in, the, building, of, the, third, front, which, involved, massive, projects, including, railroad, infrastructure, 153, 164, aerospace, industry, including, satellite, launch, facilities, 218, 219, and, steel, production, industry, including, panzhihua, iron, and, steel, 9, development, of, the, third, front, slowed, in, 1966, during, the, cultural, revolution, but, accelerated, again, after, the, sino, soviet, border, conflict, at, zhenbao, island, which, increased, the, perceived, risk, of, soviet, invasion, 12, 150, third, front, construction, again, decreased, after, united, states, president, richard, nixon, s, 1972, visit, to, china, and, the, resulting, rapprochement, between, the, united, states, and, china, 225, 229, when, reform, and, opening, up, began, after, mao, s, death, china, began, to, gradually, wind, down, third, front, projects, 180, the, third, front, distributed, physical, and, human, capital, around, the, country, ultimately, decreased, regional, disparities, and, created, favorable, conditions, for, later, market, development, 177, 182, in, 1963, mao, zedong, launched, the, socialist, education, movement, which, is, regarded, as, the, precursor, of, the, cultural, revolution, to, impose, socialist, orthodoxy, and, rid, china, of, old, elements, and, at, the, same, time, serving, certain, political, goals, mao, began, the, cultural, revolution, in, may, 1966, attempting, to, return, to, the, center, of, political, power, in, china, the, campaign, was, far, reaching, into, all, aspects, of, chinese, life, estimated, death, toll, ranges, from, hundreds, of, thousands, to, 20, 000, 000, massacres, took, place, across, the, country, while, massive, cannibalism, also, occurred, red, guards, terrorized, the, streets, as, many, ordinary, citizens, were, deemed, counter, revolutionaries, education, and, public, transportation, came, to, a, nearly, complete, halt, daily, life, involved, shouting, slogans, and, reciting, mao, quotations, many, prominent, political, leaders, including, liu, shaoqi, and, deng, xiaoping, were, purged, and, deemed, capitalist, roaders, the, campaign, would, not, come, to, a, complete, end, until, the, death, of, mao, zedong, and, arrest, of, the, gang, of, four, in, 1976, the, second, constitution, of, china, known, as, the, 1975, constitution, was, passed, in, 1975, during, the, cultural, revolution, on, the, other, hand, by, the, time, of, mao, s, death, china, s, unity, and, sovereignty, were, assured, for, the, first, time, in, a, century, and, there, was, development, of, infrastructure, industry, healthcare, education, only, 20, of, the, population, could, read, in, 1949, compared, to, 65, 5, thirty, years, later, which, raised, standard, of, living, for, the, average, chinese, there, is, also, an, argument, that, campaigns, such, as, the, great, leap, forward, an, example, of, the, concept, new, democracy, and, the, cultural, revolution, were, essential, in, jumpstarting, china, s, development, and, purifying, its, culture, even, though, the, consequences, of, both, these, campaigns, were, economically, and, humanly, disastrous, they, left, behind, a, clean, slate, on, which, later, economic, progress, could, be, built, the, primary, foreign, policy, was, to, obtain, diplomatic, recognition, in, the, face, of, strong, american, opposition, the, bandung, conference, in, 1955, at, which, premier, zhou, enlai, led, the, chinese, delegation, was, an, important, milestone, for, china, s, foreign, relations, 80, china, developed, its, foreign, relations, with, many, newly, independent, and, soon, to, be, independent, countries, 80, china, s, five, principles, of, peaceful, coexistence, were, incorporated, into, the, ten, principles, of, bandung, 80, in, 1964, tensions, between, washington, and, paris, allowed, france, to, open, relations, in, 1950, india, became, one, of, the, first, countries, to, recognize, people, s, republic, of, china, and, establish, formal, diplomatic, relation, however, india, had, close, ties, to, the, ussr, and, in, 1962, a, one, month, sino, indian, war, and, also, a, one, month, second, sino, indian, war, in, 1967, broke, out, along, their, remote, border, border, tensions, flared, from, time, to, time, ever, since, beijing, was, very, pleased, that, the, success, of, the, soviet, union, in, the, space, race, the, original, sputniks, demonstrated, that, the, international, communist, movement, had, caught, up, in, high, technology, with, the, americans, mao, assumed, that, the, soviets, now, had, a, military, advantage, and, should, step, up, the, cold, war, khrushchev, knew, that, the, americans, were, well, ahead, in, military, uses, of, space, the, strains, multiplied, quickly, making, a, dead, letter, of, the, 1950, alliance, destroying, the, socialist, camp, unity, and, affected, the, world, balance, of, power, the, split, started, with, nikita, khrushchev, de, stalinization, program, it, angered, mao, who, admired, stalin, moscow, and, beijing, became, worldwide, rivals, forcing, communist, parties, around, the, world, to, take, sides, many, of, them, split, so, that, the, pro, soviet, communists, were, battling, the, pro, chinese, communists, for, local, control, of, the, left, wing, forces, in, much, of, the, world, internally, the, sino, soviet, split, encouraged, mao, to, plunge, china, into, the, cultural, revolution, to, expunge, traces, of, soviet, ways, of, thinking, mao, argued, that, as, far, as, all, out, nuclear, war, was, concerned, the, human, race, would, not, be, destroyed, and, instead, a, brave, new, communist, world, would, arise, from, the, ashes, of, imperialism, this, attitude, troubled, moscow, which, had, a, more, realistic, view, of, the, utter, disasters, that, would, accompany, a, nuclear, war, three, major, issues, suddenly, became, critical, in, dividing, the, two, nations, taiwan, india, and, china, s, great, leap, forward, although, moscow, supported, beijing, s, position, that, taiwan, entirely, belong, to, china, it, demanded, that, it, be, forewarned, of, any, invasion, or, serious, threat, that, would, bring, american, intervention, beijing, refused, and, the, chinese, bombardment, of, the, island, of, quemoy, in, august, 1958, escalated, the, tensions, moscow, was, cultivating, india, both, as, a, major, purchaser, of, russian, munitions, and, a, strategically, critical, ally, however, china, was, escalating, its, threats, to, the, northern, fringes, of, india, especially, from, tibet, it, was, building, a, militarily, significant, road, system, that, would, reach, disputed, areas, along, the, border, the, russians, clearly, favored, india, and, beijing, reacted, as, a, betrayal, by, far, the, major, ideological, issue, was, the, great, leap, forward, which, represented, a, chinese, rejection, of, the, soviet, form, of, economic, development, moscow, was, deeply, resentful, especially, since, it, had, spent, heavily, to, supply, china, with, high, technology, including, some, nuclear, skills, moscow, withdrew, its, vitally, needed, technicians, and, economic, and, military, aid, khrushchev, was, increasingly, crude, and, intemperate, ridiculing, china, and, mao, zedong, to, both, communist, and, international, audiences, beijing, responded, through, its, official, propaganda, network, of, rejecting, moscow, s, claim, to, lenin, s, heritage, beijing, insisted, it, was, the, true, inheritor, of, the, great, leninist, tradition, at, one, major, meeting, of, communist, parties, khrushchev, personally, attacked, mao, as, an, ultra, leftist, a, left, revisionist, and, compared, him, to, stalin, for, dangerous, egotism, the, conflict, was, now, out, of, control, and, was, increasingly, fought, out, in, 81, communist, parties, around, the, world, the, final, split, came, in, july, 1963, after, 50, 000, refugees, escaped, from, xinjiang, in, western, china, to, soviet, territory, to, escape, persecution, china, ridiculed, the, russian, incompetence, in, the, cuban, missile, crisis, of, 1962, as, adventurism, to, start, with, and, capitulationism, to, wind, up, on, the, losing, side, moscow, now, was, increasingly, giving, priority, to, friendly, relationships, and, test, ban, treaties, with, the, united, states, and, united, kingdom, increasingly, beijing, began, to, consider, the, soviet, union, which, it, viewed, as, social, imperialism, as, the, greatest, threat, it, faced, more, so, than, even, the, leading, capitalist, power, the, united, states, in, turn, overtures, were, made, between, the, prc, and, the, united, states, such, as, in, the, ping, pong, diplomacy, panda, diplomacy, and, the, 1972, nixon, visit, to, china, china, established, formal, relationships, with, several, major, western, countries, and, japan, typically, the, other, party, broke, relations, it, had, with, the, government, on, taiwan, only, major, disasters, are, presented, below, click, to, show, during, the, mao, era, tens, of, millions, of, people, died, during, various, political, movements, as, well, as, during, the, great, chinese, famine, while, tens, of, millions, of, other, people, were, persecuted, and, permanently, crippled, china, turned, into, a, de, facto, one, party, state, after, the, anti, rightist, campaign, starting, in, 1957, during, which, democracy, and, the, rule, of, law, were, damaged, while, at, least, 550, 000, intellectuals, and, political, dissidents, were, persecuted, moreover, the, cultural, revolution, severely, damaged, the, rule, of, law, as, well, as, traditional,
