had, been, mounted, and, some, armies, such, as, those, of, the, ostrogoths, were, mainly, cavalry, however, it, was, the, franks, who, generally, fielded, armies, composed, of, large, masses, of, infantry, with, an, infantry, elite, the, comitatus, which, often, rode, to, battle, on, horseback, rather, than, marching, on, foot, when, the, armies, of, the, frankish, ruler, charles, martel, defeated, the, umayyad, arab, invasion, at, the, battle, of, tours, in, 732, the, frankish, forces, were, still, largely, infantry, armies, with, elites, riding, to, battle, but, dismounting, to, fight, in, the, early, medieval, period, any, well, equipped, horseman, could, be, described, as, a, knight, or, miles, in, latin, the, first, knights, appeared, during, the, reign, of, charlemagne, in, the, 8th, century, as, the, carolingian, age, progressed, the, franks, were, generally, on, the, attack, and, larger, numbers, of, warriors, took, to, their, horses, to, ride, with, the, emperor, in, his, wide, ranging, campaigns, of, conquest, at, about, this, time, the, franks, increasingly, remained, on, horseback, to, fight, on, the, battlefield, as, true, cavalry, rather, than, mounted, infantry, with, the, discovery, of, the, stirrup, and, would, continue, to, do, so, for, centuries, afterwards, although, in, some, nations, the, knight, returned, to, foot, combat, in, the, 14th, century, the, association, of, the, knight, with, mounted, combat, with, a, spear, and, later, a, lance, remained, a, strong, one, the, older, carolingian, ceremony, of, presenting, a, young, man, with, weapons, influenced, the, emergence, of, knighthood, ceremonies, in, which, a, noble, would, be, ritually, given, weapons, and, declared, to, be, a, knight, usually, amid, some, festivities,

given, to, the, captains, directly, by, the, emperor, to, reward, their, efforts, in, the, conquests, and, they, in, turn, were, to, grant, benefices, to, their, warrior, contingents, who, were, a, mix, of, free, and, unfree, men, in, the, century, or, so, following, charlemagne, s, death, his, newly, empowered, warrior, class, grew, stronger, still, and, charles, the, bald, declared, their, fiefs, to, be, hereditary, and, also, issued, the, edict, of, p, tres, in, 864, largely, moving, away, from, the, infantry, based, traditional, armies, and, calling, upon, all, men, who, could, afford, it, to, answer, calls, to, arms, on, horseback, to, quickly, repel, the, constant, and, wide, ranging, viking, attacks, which, is, considered, the, beginnings, of, the, period, of, knights, that, were, to, become, so, famous, and, spread, throughout, europe, in, the, following, centuries, the, period, of, chaos, in, the, 9th, and, 10th, centuries, between, the, fall, of, the, carolingian, central, authority, and, the, rise, of, separate, western, and, eastern, frankish, kingdoms, later, to, become, france, and, germany, respectively, only, entrenched, this, newly, landed, warrior, class, this, was, because, governing, power, and, defense, against, viking, magyar, and, saracen, attack, became, an, essentially, local, affair, which, revolved, around, these, new, hereditary, local, lords, and, their, demesnes, clerics, and, the, church, often, opposed, the, practices, of, the, knights, because, of, their, abuses, against, women, and, civilians, and, many, such, as, st, bernard, de, clairvaux, were, convinced, that, knights, served, the, devil, and, not, god, and, needed, reforming, in, the, course, of, the, 12th, century, knighthood, became, a, social, rank, with, a, distinction, being, made, between, milites, gregarii, non, noble, cavalrymen, and, milites, nobiles, true, knights, as, the, term, knight, became, increasingly, confined, to, denoting, a, social, rank, the, military, role, of, fully, armoured, cavalryman, gained, a, separate, term, man, at, arms, although, any, medieval, knight, going, to, war, would, automatically, serve, as, a, man, at, arms, not, all, men, at, arms, were, knights, the, first, military, orders, of, knighthood, were, the, knights, of, the, holy, sepulchre, and, the, knights, hospitaller, both, founded, shortly, after, the, first, crusade, of, 1099, followed, by, the, order, of, saint, lazarus, 1100, knights, templars, 1118, the, order, of, montesa, 1128, the, order, of, santiago, 1170, and, the, teutonic, knights, 1190, at, the, time, of, their, foundation, these, were, intended, as, monastic, orders, whose, members, would, act, as, simple, soldiers, protecting, pilgrims, it, was, only, over, the, following, century, with, the, successful, conquest, of, the, holy, land, and, the, rise, of, the, crusader, states, that, these, orders, became, powerful, and, prestigious, the, great, european, legends, of, warriors, such, as, the, paladins, the, matter, of, france, and, the, matter, of, britain, popularized, the, notion, of, chivalry, among, the, warrior, class, the, ideal, of, chivalry, as, the, ethos, of, the, christian, warrior, and, the, transmutation, of, the, term, knight, from, the, meaning, servant, soldier, and, of, chevalier, mounted, soldier, to, refer, to, a, member, of, this, ideal, class, is, significantly, influenced, by, the, crusades, on, one, hand, inspired, by, the, military, orders, of, monastic, warriors, and, on, the, other, hand, also, cross, influenced, by, islamic, saracen, ideals, of, furusiyya, the, institution, of, knights, was, already, well, established, by, the, 10th, century, while, the, knight, was, essentially, a, title, denoting, a, military, office, the, term, could, also, be, used, for, positions, of, higher, nobility, such, as, landholders, the, higher, nobles, grant, the, vassals, their, portions, of, land, fiefs, in, return, for, their, loyalty, protection, and, service, the, nobles, also, provided, their, knights, with, necessities, such, as, lodging, food, armour, weapons, horses, and, money, the, knight, generally,

s, fief, vassals, and, lords, could, maintain, any, number, of, knights, although, knights, with, more, military, experience, were, those, most, sought, after, thus, all, petty, nobles, intending, to, become, prosperous, knights, needed, a, great, deal, of, military, experience, a, knight, fighting, under, another, s, banner, was, called, a, knight, bachelor, while, a, knight, fighting, under, his, own, banner, was, a, knight, banneret, some, knights, were, familiar, with, city, culture, or, familiarized, with, it, during, training, these, knights, among, others, were, called, in, to, end, large, insurgencies, and, other, large, uprisings, that, involved, urban, areas, such, as, the, peasants, revolt, of, england, and, the, 1323, 1328, flemish, revolt, a, knight, had, to, be, born, of, nobility, typically, sons, of, knights, or, lords, in, some, cases, commoners, could, also, be, knighted, as, a, reward, for, extraordinary, military, service, children, of, the, nobility, were, cared, for, by, noble, foster, mothers, in, castles, until, they, reached, the, age, of, seven, these, seven, year, old, boys, were, given, the, title, of, page, and, turned, over, to, the, care, of,

into, foreign, lands, older, pages, were, instructed, by, knights, in, swordsmanship, equestrianism, chivalry, warfare, and, combat, using, wooden, swords, and, spears, when, the, boy, turned, 14, he, became, a, squire, in, a, religious, ceremony, the, new, squire, swore, on, a, sword, consecrated, by, a, bishop, or, priest, and, attended, to, assigned, duties, in, his, lord, s, household, during, this, time, the, squires, continued, training, in, combat, and, were, allowed, to, own, armour, rather, than, borrowing, it, squires, were, required, to, master, the, seven, points, of, agilities, riding, swimming, and, diving, shooting, different, types, of, weapons, climbing, participation, in, tournaments, wrestling, fencing, long, jumping, and, dancing, the, prerequisite, skills, for,

service, such, acts, may, include, deploying, for, an, important, quest, or, mission, or, protecting, a, high, diplomat, or, a, royal, relative, in, battle, knights, were, expected, above, all, to, fight, bravely, and, to, display, military, professionalism, and, courtesy, when, knights, were, taken, as, prisoners, of, war, they, were, customarily, held, for, ransom, in, somewhat, comfortable, surroundings, this, same, standard, of, conduct, did, not, apply, to, non, knights, archers, peasants, foot, soldiers, etc, who, were, often, slaughtered, after, capture, and, who, were, viewed, during, battle, as, mere, impediments, to, knights, getting, to, other, knights, to, fight, them, chivalry, developed, as, an, early, standard, of, professional, ethics, for, knights, who, were, relatively, affluent, horse, owners, and, were, expected, to, provide, military, services, in, exchange, for, landed, property, early, notions, of, chivalry, entailed, loyalty, to, one, s, liege, lord, and, bravery, in, battle, similar, to, the, values, of, the, heroic, age, during, the, middle, ages, this, grew, from, simple, military, professionalism, into, a, social, code, including, the, values, of, gentility, nobility, and, treating, others, reasonably, in, the, song, of, roland, c, 1100, roland, is, portrayed, as, the, ideal, knight, demonstrating, unwavering, loyalty, military, prowess, and, social, fellowship, in, wolfram, von, eschenbach, s, parzival, c, 1205, chivalry, had, become, a, blend, of, religious, duties, love, and, military, service, ramon, llull, s, book, of, the, order, of, chivalry, 1275, demonstrates, that, by, the, end, of, the, 13th, century, chivalry, entailed, a, litany, of, very, specific, duties, including, riding, warhorses, jousting, attending, tournaments, holding, round, tables, and, hunting, as, well, as, aspiring, to, the, more, thereal, virtues, of, faith, hope, charity, justice, strength, moderation, and, loyalty, knights, of, the, late, medieval, era, were, expected, by, society, to, maintain, all, these, skills, and, many, more, as, outlined, in, baldassare, castiglione, s, the, book, of, the, courtier, though, the, book, s, protagonist, count, ludovico, states, the, first, and, true, profession, of, the, ideal, courtier, must, be, that, of, arms, chivalry, derived, from, the, french, word, chevalier, cavalier, simultaneously, denoted, skilled, horsemanship, and, military, service, and, these, remained, the, primary, occupations, of, knighthood, throughout, the, middle, ages, chivalry, and, religion, were, mutually, influenced, during, the, period, of, the, crusades, the, early, crusades, helped, to, clarify, the, moral, code, of, chivalry, as, it, related, to, religion, as, a, result, christian, armies, began, to, devote, their, efforts, to, sacred, purposes, as, time, passed, clergy, instituted, religious, vows, which, required, knights, to, use, their, weapons, chiefly, for, the, protection, of, the, weak, and, defenseless, especially, women, and, orphans, and, of, churches, in, peacetime, knights, often, demonstrated, their, martial, skills, in, tournaments, which, usually, took, place, on, the, grounds, of, a, castle, knights, could, parade, their, armour, and, banner, to, the, whole, court, as, the, tournament, commenced, medieval, tournaments, were, made, up, of, martial, sports, called, hastiludes, and, were, not, only, a, major, spectator, sport, but, also, played, as, a, real, combat, simulation, it, usually, ended, with, many, knights, either, injured, or, even, killed, one, contest, was, a, free, for, all, battle, called, a, melee, where, large, groups, of, knights, numbering, hundreds, assembled, and, fought, one, another, and, the, last, knight, standing, was, the, winner, the, most, popular, and, romanticized, contest, for, knights, was, the, joust, in, this, competition, two, knights, charge, each, other, with, blunt, wooden, lances, in, an, effort, to, break, their, lance, on, the, opponent, s, head, or, body, or, unhorse, them, completely, the, loser, in, these, tournaments, had, to, turn, his, armour, and, horse, over, to, the, victor, the, last, day, was, filled, with, feasting, dancing, and, minstrel, singing, besides, formal, tournaments, there, were, also, unformalized, judicial, duels, done, by, knights, and, squires, to, end, various, disputes, countries, like, germany, britain, and, ireland, practiced, this, tradition, judicial, combat, was, of, two, forms, in, medieval, society, the, feat, of, arms, and, chivalric, combat, the, feat, of, arms, were, done, to, settle, hostilities, between, two, large, parties, and, supervised, by, a, judge, the, chivalric, combat, was, fought, when, one, party, s, honor, was, disrespected, or, challenged, and, the, conflict, could, not, be, resolved, in, court, weapons, were, standardized, and, must, be, of, the, same, caliber, the, duel, lasted, until, the, other, party, was, too, weak, to, fight, back, and, in, early, cases, the, defeated, party, were, then, subsequently, executed, examples, of, these, brutal, duels, were, the, judicial, combat, known, as, the, combat, of, the, thirty, in, 1351, and, the, trial, by, combat, fought, by, jean, de, carrouges, in, 1386, a, far, more, chivalric, duel, which, became, popular, in, the, late, middle, ages, was, the, pas, d, armes, or, passage, of, arms, in, this, hastilude, a, knight, or, a, group, of, knights, would, claim, a, bridge, lane, or, city, gate, and, challenge, other, passing, knights, to, fight, or, be, disgraced, if, a, lady, passed, unescorted, she, would, leave, behind, a, glove, or, scarf, to, be, rescued, and, returned, to, her, by, a, future, knight, who, passed, that, way, one, of, the, greatest, distinguishing, marks, of, the, knightly, class, was, the, flying, of, coloured, banners, to, display, power, and, to, distinguish, knights, in, battle, and, in, tournaments, knights, are, generally, armigerous, bearing, a, coat, of, arms, and, indeed, they, played, an, essential, role, in, the, development, of, heraldry, as, heavier, armour, including, enlarged, shields, and, enclosed, helmets, developed, in, the, middle, ages, the, need, for, marks, of, identification, arose, and, with, coloured, shields, and, surcoats, coat, armoury, was, born, armorial, rolls, were, created, to, record, the, knights, of, various, regions, or, those, who, participated, in, various, tournaments, knights, used, a, variety, of, weapons, including, maces, axes, and, swords, elements, of, the, knightly, armour, included, helmet, cuirass, gauntlet, and, shield, the, sword, was, a, weapon, designed, to, be, used, solely, in, combat, it, was, useless, in, hunting, and, impractical, as, a, tool, thus, the, sword, was, a, status, symbol, among, the, knightly, class, swords, were, effective, against, lightly, armoured, enemies, while, maces, and, warhammers, were, more, effective, against, heavily, armoured, ones, 85, 86, one, of, the, primary, elements, of, a, knight, s, armour, was, the, shield, which, could, be, used, to, block, strikes, and, projectiles, oval, shields, were, used, during, the, dark, ages, and, were, made, of, wooden, boards, that, were, roughly, half, an, inch, thick, towards, the, end, of, the, 10th, century, oval, shields, were, lengthened, to, cover, the, left, knee, of, the, mounted, warrior, called, the, kite, shield, the, heater, shield, was, used, during, the, 13th, and, the, first, half, of, the, 14th, century, around, 1350, square, shields, called, bouched, shields, appeared, which, had, a, notch, in, which, to, place, the, couched, lance, 15, until, the, mid, 14th, century, knights, wore, mail, armour, as, their, main, form, of, defence, mail, was, extremely, flexible, and, provided, good, protection, against, sword, cuts, but, weak, against, blunt, weapons, such, as, the, mace, and, piercing, weapons, such, as, the, lance, padded, undergarment, known, as, aketon, was, worn, to, absorb, shock, damage, and, prevent, chafing, caused, by, mail, in, hotter, climates, metal, rings, became, too, hot, so, sleeveless, surcoats, were, worn, as, a, protection, against, the, sun, and, also, to, show, their, heraldic, arms, 15, 17, this, sort, of, coat, also, evolved, to, be, tabards, waffenrocks, and, other, garments, with, the, arms, of, the, wearer, sewn, into, it, helmets, of, the, knight, of, the, early, periods, usually, were, more, open, helms, such, as, the, nasal, helmet, and, later, forms, of, the, spangenhelm, the, lack, of, more, facial, protection, lead, to, the, evolution, of, more, enclosing, helmets, to, be, made, in, the, late, 12th, to, early, 13th, centuries, this, eventually, would, evolve, to, make, the, great, helm, later, forms, of, the, bascinet, which, was, originally, a, small, helm, worn, under, the, larger, great, helm, evolved, to, be, worn, solely, and, would, eventually, have, pivoted, or, hinged, visors, the, most, popular, was, the, hounskull, also, known, as, the, pig, face, visor, plate, armour, first, appeared, in, the, 13th, century, when, plates, were, added, onto, the, torso, and, mounted, to, a, base, of, leather, this, form, of, armour, is, known, as, a, coat, of, plates, and, was, initially, used, over, chain, mail, in, the, 13th, and, 14th, centuries, at, the, time, of, transitional, armour, the, torso, was, not, the, only, part, of, the, knight, to, receive, this, plate, protection, evolution, as, the, elbows, and, shoulders, were, covered, with, circular, pieces, of, metal, commonly, referred, to, as, rondels, eventually, evolving, into, the, plate, arm, harness, consisting, of, the, rerebrace, vambrace, and, spaulder, or, pauldron, the, legs, too, were, covered, in, plates, mainly, on, the, shin, called, schynbalds, which, later, evolved, to, fully, enclose, the, leg, in, the, form, of, enclosed, greaves, as, for, the, upper, legs, cuisses, came, about, in, the, mid, 14th, century, overall, plate, armour, offered, better, protection, against, piercing, weapons, such, as, arrows, and, especially, bolts, than, mail, armour, did, 15, 17, plate, armor, reached, his, peak, in, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, but, was, still, used, at, the, beginning, of, the, 17th, century, by, the, first, cuirassiers, like, the, london, lobsters, knights, horses, were, also, armoured, in, later, periods, caparisons, were, the, first, form, of, medieval, horse, coverage, and, was, used, much, like, the, surcoat, other, armours, such, as, the, facial, armouring, chanfron, were, made, for, horses, knights, and, the, ideals, of, knighthood, featured, largely, in, medieval, and, renaissance, literature, and, have, secured, a, permanent, place, in, literary, romance, while, chivalric, romances, abound, particularly, notable, literary, portrayals, of, knighthood, include, the, song, of, roland, cantar, de, mio, cid, the, twelve, of, england, geoffrey, chaucer, s, the, knight, s, tale, baldassare, castiglione, s, the, book, of, the, courtier, and, miguel, de, cervantes, don, quixote, as, well, as, sir, thomas, malory, s, le, morte, d, arthur, and, other, arthurian, tales, geoffrey, of, monmouth, s, historia, regum, britanniae, the, pearl, poet, s, sir, gawain, and, the, green, knight, etc, geoffrey, of, monmouth, s, historia, regum, britanniae, history, of, the, kings, of, britain, written, in, the, 1130s, introduced, the, legend, of, king, arthur, which, was, to, be, important, to, the, development, of, chivalric, ideals, in, literature, sir, thomas, malory, s, le, morte, d, arthur, the, death, of, arthur, written, in, 1469, was, important, in, defining, the, ideal, of, chivalry, which, is, essential, to, the, modern, concept, of, the, knight, as, an, elite, warrior, sworn, to, uphold, the, values, of, faith, loyalty, courage, and, honour, instructional, literature, was, also, created, geoffroi, de, charny, s, book, of, chivalry, expounded, upon, the, importance, of, christian, faith, in, every, area, of, a, knight, s, life, though, still, laying, stress, on, the, primarily, military, focus, of, knighthood, in, the, early, renaissance, greater, emphasis, was, laid, upon, courtliness, the, ideal, courtier, the, chivalrous, knight, of, baldassarre, castiglione, s, the, book, of, the, courtier, became, a, model, of, the, ideal, virtues, of, nobility, castiglione, s, tale, took, the, form, of, a, discussion, among, the, nobility, of, the, court, of, the, duke, of, urbino, in, which, the, characters, determine, that, the, ideal, knight, should, be, renowned, not, only, for, his, bravery, and, prowess, in, battle, but, also, as, a, skilled, dancer, athlete, singer, and, orator, and, he, should, also, be, well, read, in, the, humanities, and, classical, greek, and, latin, literature, later, renaissance, literature, such, as, miguel, de, cervantes, s, don, quixote, rejected, the, code, of, chivalry, as, unrealistic, idealism, the, rise, of, christian, humanism, in, renaissance, literature, demonstrated, a, marked, departure, from, the, chivalric, romance, of, late, medieval, literature, and, the, chivalric, ideal, ceased, to, influence, literature, over, successive, centuries, until, it, saw, some, pockets, of, revival, in, post, victorian, literature, by, the, mid, to, late, 16th, century, knights, were, quickly, becoming, obsolete, as, countries, started, creating, their, own, standing, armies, that, were, faster, to, train, cheaper, to, equip, and, easier, to, mobilize, the, advancement, of, high, powered, firearms, contributed, greatly, to, the, decline, in, use, of, plate, armour, as, the, time, it, took, to, train, soldiers, with, guns, was, much, less, compared, to, that, of, the, knight, the, cost, of, equipment, was, also, significantly, lower, and, guns, had, a, reasonable, chance, to, easily, penetrate, a, knight, s, armour, in, the, 14th, century, the, use, of, infantrymen, armed, with, pikes, and, fighting, in, close, formation, also, proved, effective, against, heavy, cavalry, such, as, during, the, battle, of, nancy, when, charles, the, bold, and, his, armoured, cavalry, were, decimated, by, swiss, pikemen, as, the, feudal, system, came, to, an, end, lords, saw, no, further, use, of, knights, many, landowners, found, the, duties, of, knighthood, too, expensive, and, so, contented, themselves, with, the, use, of, squires, mercenaries, also, became, an, economic, alternative, to, knights, when, conflicts, arose, armies, of, the, time, started, adopting, a, more, realistic, approach, to, warfare, than, the, honor, bound, code, of, chivalry, soon, the, remaining, knights, were, absorbed, into, professional, armies, although, they, had, a, higher, rank, than, most, soldiers, because, of, their, valuable, lineage, they, lost, their, distinctive, identity, that, previously, set, them, apart, from, common, soldiers, some, knightly, orders, survived, into, modern, times, they, adopted, newer, technology, while, still, retaining, their, age, old, chivalric, traditions, examples, include, the, knights, of, the, holy, sepulchre, knights, hospitaller, and, teutonic, knights, when, chivalry, had, long, since, declined, the, cavalry, of, the, early, modern, era, clung, to, the, old, ideals, even, the, first, fighter, pilots, of, the, first, world, war, in, the, 20th, century, still, resorted, to, knightly, ideas, in, their, duels, in, the, sky, aimed, at, fairness, and, honesty, at, least, such, chivalry, was, spread, in, the, media, this, idea, was, then, completely, lost, in, later, wars, or, was, perverted, by, nazi, germany, which, awarded, a, knight, s, cross, as, an, award, conversely, the, austrian, priest, and, resistance, fighter, heinrich, maier, is, referred, to, as, miles, christi, a, christian, knight, against, nazi, germany, while, on, the, one, hand, attempts, are, made, again, and, again, to, revive, or, restore, old, knightly, orders, in, order, to, gain, prestige, awards, and, financial, advantages, on, the, other, hand, old, orders, continue, to, exist, or, are, activated, this, especially, in, the, environment, of, ruling, or, formerly, ruling, noble, houses, for, example, the, british, queen, elizabeth, ii, regularly, appointed, new, members, to, the, order, of, the, british, empire, which, also, includes, members, such, as, steven, spielberg, nelson, mandela, and, bill, gates, in, the, 21st, century, in, central, europe, for, example, the, order, of, st, george, whose, roots, go, back, to, the, so, called, last, knight, emperor, maximilian, i, was, reactivated, by, the, house, of, habsburg, after, its, dissolution, by, nazi, germany, and, the, fall, of, the, iron, curtain, and, in, republican, france, deserved, personalities, are, highlighted, to, this, day, by, the, award, of, the, knight, of, honor, chevalier, de, la, l, gion, d, honneur, legion, of, honour, in, contrast, the, knights, of, the, ecclesiastical, knightly, orders, like, the, sovereign, military, order, of, malta, and, the, order, of, saint, john, mainly, devote, themselves, to, social, tasks, and, care, the, journalist, alexander, von, sch, nburg, dealt, with, nature, and, the, possible, necessity, of, chivalry, in, view, of, the, complete, social, disorientation, of, the, people, he, diagnosed, he, calls, for, a, return, to, virtues, such, as, modesty, wisdom, and, above, all, loyalty, for, according, to, him, the, common, creed, today, is, roughness, ignorance, and, egocentrism, vinzenz, stimpfl, abele, procurator, of, the, habsburg, order, of, st, george, goes, back, to, bernhard, von, clairvaux, to, consider, the, importance, of, knights, in, the, 21st, century, accordingly, knights, must, take, an, active, part, in, the, fight, against, misery, in, society, especially, today, the, current, activities, of, the, knights, of, the, order, of, malta, and, the, order, of, st, john, who, since, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, have, increasingly, provided, extensive, medical, and, charitable, services, during, wars, and, peacetime, have, also, developed, in, this, direction, in, continental, europe, different, systems, of, hereditary, knighthood, have, existed, or, do, exist, in, the, kingdom, of, spain, the, royal, house, of, spain, grants, titles, of, knighthood, to, the, successor, of, the, throne, this, knighthood, title, known, as, order, of, the, golden, fleece, is, probably, the, most, prestigious, and, exclusive, chivalric, order, this, order, can, also, be, granted, to, persons, not, belonging, to, the, spanish, crown, as, the, former, emperor, of, japan, akihito, queen, of, united, kingdom, elizabeth, ii, or, the, relevant, spanish, politician, of, the, spanish, democratic, transition, adolfo, su, rez, among, others, ridder, dutch, for, knight, is, a, hereditary, noble, title, in, the, netherlands, it, is, the, lowest, title, within, the, nobility, system, and, ranks, below, that, of, baron, but, above, jonkheer, the, latter, is, not, a, title, but, a, dutch, honorific, to, show, that, someone, belongs, to, the, untitled, nobility, the, collective, term, for, its, holders, in, a, certain, locality, is, the, ridderschap, e, g, ridderschap, van, holland, ridderschap, van, friesland, etc, in, the, netherlands, no, female, equivalent, exists, before, 1814, the, history, of, nobility, is, separate, for, each, of, the, eleven, provinces, that, make, up, the, kingdom, of, the, netherlands, in, each, of, these, there, were, in, the, early, middle, ages, a, number, of, feudal, lords, who, often, were, just, as, powerful, and, sometimes, more, so, than, the, rulers, themselves, during, this, period, knights, ranked, below, the, ruler, and, above, the, feudal, barons, dutch, heren, in, the, netherlands, only, 10, knightly, families, are, still, extant, a, number, which, steadily, decreases, because, in, that, country, ennoblement, or, incorporation, into, the, nobility, is, not, possible, anymore, likewise, ridder, dutch, for, knight, or, the, equivalent, french, chevalier, is, a, hereditary, noble, title, in, belgium, it, is, the, second, lowest, title, within, the, nobility, system, above, cuyer, or, jonkheer, jonkvrouw, and, below, baron, like, in, the, netherlands, no, female, equivalent, to, the, title, exists, belgium, still, does, have, about, 232, registered, knightly, families, the, german, and, austrian, equivalent, of, an, hereditary, knight, is, a, ritter, this, designation, is, used, as, a, title, of, nobility, in, all, german, speaking, areas, traditionally, it, denotes, the, second, lowest, rank, within, the, nobility, standing, above, edler, noble, and, below, freiherr, baron, for, its, historical, association, with, warfare, and, the, landed, gentry, in, the, middle, ages, it, can, be, considered, roughly, equal, to, the, titles, of, knight, or, baronet, the, royal, house, of, portugal, historically, bestowed, hereditary, knighthoods, to, holders, of, the, highest, ranks, in, the, royal, orders, today, the, head, of, the, royal, house, of, portugal, duarte, pio, duke, of, braganza, bestows, hereditary, knighthoods, for, extraordinary, acts, of, sacrifice, and, service, to, the, royal, house, there, are, very, few, hereditary, knights, and, they, are, entitled, to, wear, an, oval, neck, badge, with, the, shield, of, the, house, of, braganza, as, there, are, two, classes, of, hereditary, knights, in, portugal, the, highest, grade, is, the, hereditary, knight, with, grand, collar, portuguese, hereditary, knighthoods, confer, nobility, in, france, the, hereditary, knighthood, existed, similarly, throughout, as, a, title, of, nobility, as, well, as, in, regions, formerly, under, holy, roman, empire, control, one, family, ennobled, with, a, title, in, such, a, manner, is, the, house, of, hauteclocque, by, letters, patents, of, 1752, even, if, its, most, recent, members, used, a, pontifical, title, of, count, in, some, other, regions, such, as, normandy, a, specific, type, of, fief, was, granted, to, the, lower, ranked, knights, french, chevaliers, called, the, fief, de, haubert, referring, to, the, hauberk, or, chain, mail, shirt, worn, almost, daily, by, knights, as, they, would, not, only, fight, for, their, liege, lords, but, enforce, and, carry, out, their, orders, on, a, routine, basis, as, well, later, the, term, came, to, officially, designate, the, higher, rank, of, the, nobility, in, the, ancien, r, gime, the, lower, rank, being, squire, as, the, romanticism, and, prestige, associated, with, the, term, grew, in, the, late, middle, ages, and, the, renaissance, italy, and, poland, also, had, the, hereditary, knighthood, that, existed, within, their, respective, systems, of, nobility, just, as, with, the, royal, house, of, portugal, the, royal, house, of, italy, house, of, savoy, continue, to, confer, their, dynastic, orders, of, chivalry, on, both, italian, and, non, italian, citizens, these, dynastic, orders, include, the, supreme, order, of, the, most, holy, annunciation, order, of, saints, maurice, and, lazarus, and, the, civil, order, of, savoy, additionally, the, royal, house, of, bourbon, two, sicilies, confers, their, dynastic, orders, of, chivalry, on, both, italian, and, non, italian, citizens, including, the, dynastic, orders, of, order, of, saint, januarius, sacred, military, constantinian, order, of, saint, george, and, the, order, of, saint, ferdinand, and, of, merit, there, are, traces, of, the, continental, system, of, hereditary, knighthood, in, ireland, notably, all, three, of, the, following, belong, to, the, hiberno, norman, fitzgerald, dynasty, created, by, the, earls, of, desmond, acting, as, earls, palatine, for, their, kinsmen, another, irish, family, were, the, o, shaughnessys, who, were, created, knights, in, 1553, under, the, policy, of, surrender, and, regrant, first, established, by, henry, viii, of, england, they, were, attainted, in, 1697, for, participation, on, the, jacobite, side, in, the, williamite, wars, since, 1611, the, british, crown, has, awarded, a, hereditary, title, in, the, form, of, the, baronetcy, like, knights, baronets, are, accorded, the, title, sir, baronets, are, not, peers, of, the, realm, and, have, never, been, entitled, to, sit, in, the, house, of, lords, therefore, like, knights, they, remain, commoners, in, the, view, of, the, british, legal, system, however, unlike, knights, the, title, is, hereditary, and, the, recipient, does, not, receive, an, accolade, the, position, is, therefore, more, comparable, with, hereditary, knighthoods, in, continental, european, orders, of, nobility, such, as, ritter, than, with, knighthoods, under, the, british, orders, of, chivalry, however, unlike, the, continental, orders, the, british, baronetcy, system, was, a, modern, invention, designed, specifically, to, raise, money, for, the, crown, with, the, purchase, of, the, title, other, orders, were, established, in, the, iberian, peninsula, under, the, influence, of, the, orders, in, the, holy, land, and, the, crusader, movement, of, the, reconquista, and, generally, aligned, with, geographical, area, for, example, after, the, crusades, the, military, orders, became, idealized, and, romanticized, resulting, in, the, late, medieval, notion, of, chivalry, as, reflected, in, the, chivalric, romances, of, the, time, the, creation, of, chivalric, orders, was, fashionable, among, the, nobility, in, the, 14th, and, 15th, centuries, and, this, is, still, reflected, in, contemporary, honours, systems, including, the, term, order, itself, examples, of, notable, orders, of, chivalry, are, from, roughly, 1560, purely, honorific, orders, were, established, as, a, way, to, confer, prestige, and, distinction, unrelated, to, military, service, and, chivalry, in, the, more, narrow, sense, such, orders, were, particularly, popular, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, and, knighthood, continues, to, be, conferred, in, various, countries, there, are, other, monarchies, and, also, republics, that, also, follow, this, practice, modern, knighthoods, are, typically, conferred, in, recognition, for, services, rendered, to, society, which, are, not, necessarily, martial, in, nature, the, british, musician, elton, john, for, example, is, a, knight, bachelor, thus, entitled, to, be, called, sir, elton, the, female, equivalent, is, a, dame, for, example, dame, julie, andrews, in, the, united, kingdom, honorific, knighthood, may, be, conferred, in, two, different, ways, in, the, british, honours, system, the, knightly, style, of, sir, and, its, female, equivalent, dame, are, followed, by, the, given, name, only, when, addressing, the, holder, thus, sir, elton, john, should, be, addressed, as, sir, elton, not, sir, john, or, mr, john, similarly, actress, dame, judi, dench, should, be, addressed, as, dame, judi, not, dame, dench, or, ms, dench, wives, of, knights, however, are, entitled, to, the, honorific, pre, nominal, lady, before, their, husband, s, surname, thus, sir, paul, mccartney, s, ex, wife, was, formally, styled, lady, mccartney, rather, than, lady, paul, mccartney, or, lady, heather, mccartney, the, style, dame, heather, mccartney, could, be, used, for, the, wife, of, a, knight, however, this, style, is, largely, archaic, and, is, only, used, in, the, most, formal, of, documents, or, where, the, wife, is, a, dame, in, her, own, right, such, as, dame, norma, major, who, gained, her, title, six, years, before, her, husband, sir, john, major, was, knighted, the, husbands, of, dames, have, no, honorific, pre, nominal, so, dame, norma, s, husband, remained, john, major, until, he, received, his, own, knighthood, up, until, 1965, it, was, not, permitted, to, use, these, titles, until, after, the, knight, concerned, had, received, the, accolade, but, in, that, year, the, prohibition, was, lifted, and, it, is, now, permitted, to, use, the, titles, immediately, from, the, time, the, award, is, gazetted, with, the, award, of, a, kcvo, to, the, rt, rev, randall, davidson, in, 1902, the, custom, was, established, whereby, a, clerk, in, holy, orders, in, the, church, of, england, on, being, appointed, to, a, degree, of, knighthood, does, not, received, the, accolade, he, receives, the, insignia, of, his, honour, and, may, place, the, appropriate, letters, after, his, name, or, title, but, he, may, not, be, called, sir, and, his, wife, may, not, be, called, lady, this, custom, is, not, observed, in, australia, and, new, zealand, where, knighted, anglican, clergymen, routinely, use, the, title, sir, ministers, of, other, christian, churches, are, entitled, to, receive, the, accolade, for, example, sir, norman, cardinal, gilroy, did, receive, the, accolade, on, his, appointment, as, knight, commander, of, the, most, excellent, order, of, the, british, empire, in, 1969, a, knight, who, is, subsequently, ordained, does, not, lose, his, title, a, famous, example, of, this, situation, was, the, revd, sir, derek, pattinson, who, was, ordained, just, a, year, after, he, was, appointed, knight, bachelor, apparently, somewhat, to, the, consternation, of, officials, at, buckingham, palace, a, woman, clerk, in, holy, orders, may, be, made, a, dame, in, exactly, the, same, way, as, any, other, woman, since, there, are, no, military, connotations, attached, to, the, honour, a, clerk, in, holy, orders, who, is, a, baronet, is, entitled, to, use, the, title, sir, outside, the, british, honours, system, it, is, usually, considered, improper, to, address, a, knighted, person, as, sir, or, dame, notable, exceptions, are, members, of, the, order, of, the, knights, of, rizal, in, the, republic, of, the, philippines, some, countries, however, historically, did, have, equivalent, honorifics, for, knights, such, as, cavaliere, in, italy, e, g, cavaliere, benito, mussolini, and, ritter, in, germany, and, the, austro, hungarian, empire, e, g, georg, ritter, von, trapp, state, knighthoods, in, the, netherlands, are, issued, in, three, orders, the, order, of, william, the, order, of, the, netherlands, lion, and, the, order, of, orange, nassau, additionally, there, remain, a, few, hereditary, knights, in, the, netherlands, in, belgium, honorific, knighthood, not, hereditary, can, be, conferred, by, the, king, on, particularly, meritorious, individuals, such, as, scientists, or, eminent, businessmen, or, for, instance, to, astronaut, frank, de, winne, the, second, belgian, in, space, this, practice, is, similar, to, the, conferral, of, the, dignity, of, knight, bachelor, in, the, united, kingdom, in, addition, there, still, are, a, number, of, hereditary, knights, in, belgium, see, below, in, france, and, belgium, one, of, the, ranks, conferred, in, some, orders, of, merit, such, as, the, l, gion, d, honneur, the, ordre, national, du, m, rite, the, ordre, des, palmes, acad, miques, and, the, ordre, des, arts, et, des, lettres, in, france, and, the, order, of, leopold, order, of, the, crown, and, order, of, leopold, ii, in, belgium, is, that, of, chevalier, in, french, or, ridder, in, dutch, meaning, knight, in, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, the, monarchs, tried, to, establish, chivalric, orders, but, the, hereditary, lords, who, controlled, the, union, did, not, agree, and, managed, to, ban, such, assemblies, they, feared, the, king, would, use, orders, to, gain, support, for, absolutist, goals, and, to, make, formal, distinctions, among, the, peerage, which, could, lead, to, its, legal, breakup, into, two, separate, classes, and, that, the, king, would, later, play, one, against, the, other, and, eventually, limit, the, legal, privileges, of, hereditary, nobility, but, finally, in, 1705, king, august, ii, managed, to, establish, the, order, of, the, white, eagle, which, remains, poland, s, most, prestigious, order, of, that, kind, the, head, of, state, now, the, president, as, the, acting, grand, master, confers, knighthoods, of, the, order, to, distinguished, citizens, foreign, monarchs, and, other, heads, of, state, the, order, has, its, chapter, there, were, no, particular, honorifics, that, would, accompany, a, knight, s, name, as, historically, all, or, at, least, by, far, most, of, its, members, would, be, royals, or, hereditary, lords, anyway, so, today, a, knight, is, simply, referred, to, as, name, surname, knight, of, the, white, eagle, order, in, nigeria, holders, of, religious, honours, like, the, knighthood, of, st, gregory, make, use, of, the, word, sir, as, a, pre, nominal, honorific, in, much, the, same, way, as, it, is, used, for, secular, purposes, in, britain, and, the, philippines, wives, of, such, individuals, also, typically, assume, the, title, of, lady, women, were, appointed, to, the, order, of, the, garter, almost, from, the, start, in, all, 68, women, were, appointed, between, 1358, and, 1488, including, all, consorts, though, many, were, women, of, royal, blood, or, wives, of, knights, of, the, garter, some, women, were, neither, they, wore, the, garter, on, the, left, arm, and, some, are, shown, on, their, tombstones, with, this, arrangement, after, 1488, no, other, appointments, of, women, are, known, although, it, is, said, that, the, garter, was, conferred, upon, neapolitan, poet, laura, bacio, terricina, by, king, edward, vi, in, 1638, a, proposal, was, made, to, revive, the, use, of, robes, for, the, wives, of, knights, in, ceremonies, but, this, did, not, occur, queens, consort, have, been, made, ladies, of, the, garter, since, 1901, queens, alexandra, in, 1901, mary, in, 1910, and, elizabeth, in, 1937, the, first, non, royal, woman, to, be, made, lady, companion, of, the, garter, was, the, duchess, of, norfolk, in, 1990, the, second, was, the, baroness, thatcher, in, 1995, post, nominal, lg, on, 30, november, 1996, lady, fraser, was, made, lady, of, the, thistle, the, first, non, royal, woman, post, nominal, lt, see, edmund, fellowes, knights, of, the, garter, 1939, and, beltz, memorials, of, the, order, of, the, garter, the, first,
