the, republic, of, venice, traditionally, known, as, la, serenissima, was, a, sovereign, state, and, maritime, republic, with, its, capital, in, venice, founded, according, to, tradition, in, 697, by, paolo, lucio, anafesto, over, the, course, of, its, 1, 100, years, of, history, it, established, itself, as, one, of, the, major, european, commercial, and, naval, powers, initially, extended, in, the, dogado, area, a, territory, currently, comparable, to, the, metropolitan, city, of, venice, during, its, history, it, annexed, a, large, part, of, northeast, italy, istria, dalmatia, the, coasts, of, present, day, montenegro, and, albania, as, well, as, numerous, islands, in, the, adriatic, and, eastern, ionian, seas, at, the, height, of, its, expansion, between, the, 13th, and, 16th, centuries, it, also, governed, the, peloponnese, crete, and, cyprus, most, of, the, greek, islands, as, well, as, several, cities, and, ports, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, the, islands, of, the, venetian, lagoon, in, the, 7th, century, after, having, experienced, a, period, of, substantial, increase, in, population, were, organized, into, maritime, venice, a, byzantine, duchy, dependent, on, the, exarchate, of, ravenna, with, the, fall, of, the, exarchate, and, the, weakening, of, byzantine, power, the, duchy, of, venice, arose, led, by, a, doge, and, established, on, the, island, of, rialto, it, prospered, from, maritime, trade, with, the, byzantine, empire, and, other, eastern, states, to, safeguard, the, trade, routes, between, the, 9th, and, 11th, centuries, the, duchy, waged, several, wars, which, ensured, its, complete, dominion, over, the, adriatic, owing, to, participation, in, the, crusades, penetration, into, eastern, markets, became, increasingly, stronger, and, between, the, 12th, and, 13th, centuries, venice, managed, to, extend, its, power, into, numerous, eastern, emporiums, and, commercial, ports, the, supremacy, over, the, mediterranean, sea, led, the, republic, to, the, clash, with, genoa, which, lasted, until, the, 14th, century, when, after, having, risked, complete, collapse, during, the, war, of, chioggia, with, the, genoese, army, and, fleet, in, the, lagoon, for, a, long, period, venice, quickly, managed, to, recover, from, the, territorial, losses, suffered, with, the, treaty, of, turin, of, 1381, and, begin, expansion, on, the, mainland, venetian, expansion, however, led, to, the, coalition, of, the, habsburg, monarchy, spain, and, france, in, the, league, of, cambrai, which, in, 1509, defeated, the, republic, of, venice, in, the, battle, of, agnadello, while, maintaining, most, of, its, mainland, possessions, venice, was, defeated, and, the, attempt, to, expand, the, eastern, dominions, caused, a, long, series, of, wars, against, the, ottoman, empire, which, ended, only, in, the, 18th, century, with, the, treaty, of, passarowitz, of, 1718, and, which, caused, the, loss, of, all, possessions, in, the, aegean, although, still, a, thriving, cultural, centre, the, republic, of, venice, was, occupied, by, napoleon, s, french, troops, and, its, territories, were, divided, with, the, habsburg, monarchy, following, the, ratification, of, the, treaty, of, campo, formio, throughout, its, history, the, republic, of, venice, was, characterized, by, its, political, order, inherited, from, the, previous, byzantine, administrative, structures, its, head, of, state, was, the, doge, a, position, which, became, elective, from, the, end, of, the, 9th, century, in, addition, to, the, doge, the, administration, of, the, republic, was, directed, by, various, assemblies, the, great, council, with, legislative, functions, which, was, supported, by, the, minor, council, the, council, of, forty, and, the, council, of, ten, responsible, for, judicial, matters, and, the, senate, during, its, long, history, the, republic, of, venice, took, on, various, names, all, closely, linked, to, the, titles, attributed, to, the, doge, during, the, 8th, century, when, venice, still, depended, on, the, byzantine, empire, the, doge, was, called, in, latin, dux, venetiarum, provinciae, doge, of, the, province, of, venice, and, then, starting, from, 840, dux, veneticorum, doge, of, the, venetians, following, the, signing, of, the, pactum, lotharii, this, commercial, agreement, stipulated, between, the, duchy, of, venice, ducatum, venetiae, and, the, carolingian, empire, de, facto, ratified, the, independence, of, venice, from, the, byzantine, empire, in, the, following, century, references, to, venice, as, a, byzantine, dominion, disappeared, and, in, a, document, from, 976, there, is, a, mention, of, the, most, glorious, domino, venetiarum, lord, of, venice, where, the, most, glorious, appellative, had, already, been, used, for, the, first, time, in, the, pactum, lotharii, and, where, the, appellative, lord, refers, to, the, fact, that, the, doge, was, still, considered, like, a, king, even, if, elected, by, the, popular, assembly, gaining, independence, venice, also, began, to, expand, on, the, coasts, of, the, adriatic, sea, and, so, starting, from, 1109, following, the, conquest, of, dalmatia, and, the, croatian, coast, the, doge, formally, received, the, title, of, venetiae, dalmatiae, atque, chroatiae, dux, doge, of, venice, dalmatia, and, croatia, a, name, that, continued, to, be, used, until, the, 18th, century, starting, from, the, 15th, century, the, documents, written, in, latin, were, joined, by, those, in, the, venetian, language, and, in, parallel, with, the, events, in, italy, the, duchy, of, venice, also, changed, its, name, becoming, the, lordship, of, venice, which, as, written, in, the, peace, treaty, of, 1453, with, sultan, mehmed, ii, was, fully, named, the, illustrissima, et, excellentissima, deta, signoria, de, venexia, the, most, illustrious, and, excellent, signoria, of, venice, during, the, 17th, century, monarchical, absolutism, asserted, itself, in, many, countries, of, continental, europe, radically, changing, the, european, political, landscape, this, change, made, it, possible, to, more, markedly, determine, the, differences, between, monarchies, and, republics, while, the, former, had, economies, governed, by, strict, laws, and, dominated, by, agriculture, the, latter, lived, off, of, commercial, affairs, and, free, markets, moreover, the, monarchies, in, addition, to, being, led, by, a, single, ruling, family, were, more, prone, to, war, and, religious, uniformity, this, increasingly, noticeable, difference, between, monarchy, and, republic, began, to, be, specified, also, in, official, documents, and, it, was, hence, that, names, such, as, the, republic, of, genoa, or, the, republic, of, the, seven, united, provinces, were, born, the, lordship, of, venice, also, adapted, to, this, new, terminology, becoming, the, most, serene, republic, of, venice, italian, serenissima, repubblica, di, venezia, venetian, seren, sima, rep, blega, de, venexia, a, name, by, which, it, is, best, known, today, similarly, the, doge, was, also, given, the, nickname, of, serenissimo, or, more, simply, that, of, his, serenity, from, the, 17th, century, the, republic, of, venice, took, on, other, more, or, less, official, names, such, as, the, venetian, state, or, the, venetian, republic, the, republic, is, often, referred, to, as, la, serenissima, in, reference, to, its, title, as, one, of, the, most, serene, republics, the, duchy, of, venice, was, born, in, the, 9th, century, from, the, byzantine, territories, of, maritime, venice, according, to, tradition, the, first, doge, was, elected, in, 697, but, this, figure, is, of, dubious, historicity, and, comparable, to, that, of, the, exarch, paul, who, similarly, to, the, doge, was, assassinated, in, 727, following, a, revolt, father, pietro, antonio, of, venetia, in, his, history, of, the, lagoon, city, published, in, 1688, writes, the, precise, time, in, which, that, family, arrived, in, the, adria, is, not, found, but, rather, what, already, an, inhabitant, of, the, islands, by, the, princes, who, welcomed, citizens, and, supported, with, the, advantage, of, significant, riches, in, the, year, 697, she, contributed, to, the, nomination, of, the, first, prince, marco, contarini, one, of, the, 22, tribunes, of, the, islands, who, made, the, election, in, 726, emperor, leo, iii, attempted, to, extend, iconoclasm, to, the, exarchate, of, ravenna, causing, numerous, revolts, throughout, the, territory, in, reaction, to, the, reform, the, local, populations, appointed, several, duces, to, replace, the, byzantine, governors, and, in, particular, venetia, appointed, orso, as, its, doge, who, governed, the, lagoon, for, a, decade, following, his, death, the, byzantines, entrusted, the, government, of, the, province, to, the, regime, of, the, magistri, militum, which, lasted, until, 742, when, the, emperor, granted, the, people, the, appointment, of, a, dux, the, venetians, elected, by, acclamation, theodato, son, of, orso, who, decided, to, move, the, capital, of, the, duchy, from, heraclia, to, metamauco, the, lombard, conquest, of, ravenna, in, 751, and, the, subsequent, conquest, of, the, lombard, kingdom, by, charlemagne, s, franks, in, 774, with, the, creation, of, the, carolingian, empire, in, 800, considerably, changed, the, geopolitical, context, of, the, lagoon, leading, the, venetians, to, divide, into, two, factions, a, pro, frankish, party, led, by, the, city, of, equilium, and, a, pro, byzantine, party, with, a, stronghold, in, heraclia, after, a, long, series, of, skirmishes, in, 805, doge, obelerio, decided, to, attack, both, cities, simultaneously, deporting, their, population, to, the, capital, having, taken, control, of, the, situation, the, doge, placed, venezia, under, frankish, protection, but, a, byzantine, naval, blockade, convinced, him, to, renew, his, loyalty, to, the, eastern, emperor, with, the, intention, of, conquering, venezia, in, 810, the, frankish, army, commanded, by, pepin, invaded, the, lagoon, forcing, the, local, population, to, retreat, to, rivoalto, thus, starting, a, siege, which, ended, with, the, arrival, of, the, byzantine, fleet, and, the, retreat, of, the, franks, following, the, failed, frankish, conquest, doge, obelerio, was, replaced, by, the, pro, byzantine, nobleman, agnello, participazio, who, definitively, moved, the, capital, to, rivoalto, in, 812, thus, decreeing, the, birth, of, the, city, of, venice, with, his, election, agnello, partecipazio, attempted, to, make, the, ducal, office, hereditary, by, associating, an, heir, the, co, dux, with, the, throne, the, system, brought, agnello, s, two, sons, giustiniano, and, giovanni, to, the, ducal, position, who, was, deposed, in, 836, due, to, his, inadequacy, to, counter, the, narentine, pirates, in, dalmatia, following, the, deposition, of, giovanni, partecipazio, pietro, tradonico, was, elected, who, with, the, promulgation, of, the, pactum, lotharii, a, commercial, treaty, between, venice, and, the, carolingian, empire, began, the, long, process, of, detachment, of, the, province, from, the, byzantine, empire, after, tradonico, was, killed, following, a, conspiracy, in, 864, orso, i, participazio, was, elected, and, resumed, the, fight, against, piracy, managing, to, protect, the, dogado, from, attacks, by, the, saracens, and, the, patriarchate, of, aquileia, orso, managed, to, assign, the, dukedom, to, his, eldest, son, giovanni, ii, participazio, who, after, conquering, comacchio, a, rival, city, of, venice, in, the, salt, trade, decided, to, abdicate, in, favor, of, his, brother, at, the, time, patriarch, of, grado, who, refused, since, there, was, no, heir, in, 887, the, people, gathered, in, the, concio, and, elected, pietro, i, candiano, by, acclamation, the, concio, managed, to, elect, six, doges, up, to, pietro, iii, candiano, who, in, 958, assigned, the, position, of, co, dux, to, his, son, pietro, who, became, doge, the, following, year, due, to, his, land, holdings, pietro, iv, candiano, had, a, political, vision, close, to, that, of, the, holy, roman, empire, and, consequently, attempted, to, establish, feudalism, in, venice, as, well, causing, a, revolt, in, 976, which, led, to, the, burning, of, the, capital, and, the, killing, of, the, doge, these, events, led, the, venetian, patriciate, to, gain, a, growing, influence, on, the, doge, s, policies, and, the, conflicts, that, arose, following, the, doge, s, assassination, were, resolved, only, in, 991, with, the, election, of, pietro, ii, orseolo, pietro, ii, orseolo, gave, a, notable, boost, to, venetian, commercial, expansion, by, stipulating, new, commercial, privileges, with, the, holy, roman, empire, and, the, byzantine, empire, in, addition, to, diplomacy, the, doge, resumed, the, war, against, the, narentan, pirates, that, began, in, the, 9th, century, and, in, the, year, 1000, he, managed, to, subjugate, the, coastal, cities, of, istria, and, dalmatia, the, great, schism, of, 1054, and, the, outbreak, of, the, investiture, struggle, in, 1073, marginally, involved, venetian, politics, which, instead, focused, its, attention, on, the, arrival, of, the, normans, in, southern, italy, the, norman, occupation, of, durr, s, and, corfu, in, 1081, pushed, the, byzantine, empire, to, request, the, aid, of, the, venetian, fleet, which, with, the, promise, of, obtaining, extensive, commercial, privileges, and, reimbursement, of, military, expenses, decided, to, take, part, in, the, byzantine, norman, wars, the, following, year, emperor, alexios, i, komnenos, granted, venice, the, chrysobol, a, commercial, privilege, that, allowed, venetian, merchants, substantial, tax, exemptions, in, numerous, byzantine, ports, and, the, establishment, of, a, venetian, neighbourhood, in, durr, s, and, constantinople, the, war, ended, in, 1085, when, following, the, death, of, the, leader, robert, guiscard, the, norman, army, abandoned, its, positions, to, return, to, puglia, having, taken, office, in, 1118, emperor, john, ii, komnenos, decided, not, to, renew, the, chrysobol, of, 1082, arousing, the, reaction, of, venice, which, declared, war, on, the, byzantine, empire, in, 1122, the, war, ended, in, 1126, with, the, victory, of, venice, which, forced, the, emperor, to, stipulate, a, new, agreement, characterized, by, even, better, conditions, than, the, previous, ones, thus, making, the, byzantine, empire, totally, dependent, on, venetian, trade, and, protection, with, the, intention, of, weakening, the, growing, venetian, power, the, emperor, provided, substantial, commercial, support, to, the, maritime, republics, of, ancona, genoa, and, pisa, making, coexistence, with, venice, which, was, now, hegemonic, on, the, adriatic, sea, increasingly, difficult, so, much, so, that, it, was, renamed, the, gulf, of, venice, in, 1171, following, the, emperor, s, decision, to, expel, the, venetian, merchants, from, constantinople, a, new, war, broke, out, which, was, resolved, with, the, restoration, of, the, status, quo, at, the, end, of, the, 12th, century, the, commercial, traffic, of, venetian, merchants, extended, throughout, the, east, and, they, could, count, on, immense, and, solid, capital, as, in, the, rest, of, italy, starting, from, the, 12th, century, venice, also, underwent, the, transformations, that, led, to, the, age, of, the, municipalities, in, that, century, the, doge, s, power, began, to, decline, initially, supported, only, by, a, few, judges, in, 1130, it, was, decided, to, place, the, consilium, sapientium, which, would, later, become, the, great, council, of, venice, alongside, his, power, in, the, same, period, in, addition, to, the, expulsion, of, the, clergy, from, public, life, new, assemblies, such, as, the, council, of, forty, and, the, minor, council, were, established, and, in, his, inauguration, speech, the, doge, was, forced, to, declare, loyalty, to, the, republic, with, the, promissione, ducale, thus, the, commune, of, venice, the, set, of, all, the, assemblies, aimed, at, regulating, the, power, of, the, doge, began, to, take, shape, in, the, 12th, century, venice, decided, not, to, participate, in, the, crusades, due, to, its, commercial, interests, in, the, east, and, instead, concentrated, on, maintaining, its, possessions, in, dalmatia, which, were, repeatedly, besieged, by, the, hungarians, the, situation, changed, in, 1202, when, the, doge, enrico, dandolo, decided, to, exploit, the, expedition, of, the, fourth, crusade, to, conclude, the, zara, war, and, the, following, year, after, twenty, years, of, conflict, venice, conquered, the, city, and, won, the, war, regaining, control, of, dalmatia, the, venetian, crusader, fleet, however, did, not, stop, in, dalmatia, but, continued, towards, constantinople, to, besiege, it, in, 1204, thus, putting, an, end, to, the, byzantine, empire, and, formally, making, venice, an, independent, state, severing, the, last, ties, with, the, former, byzantine, ruler, the, empire, was, dismembered, in, the, crusader, states, and, from, the, division, venice, obtained, numerous, ports, in, the, morea, and, several, islands, in, the, aegean, sea, including, crete, and, euboea, thus, giving, life, to, the, stato, da, m, r, in, addition, to, the, territorial, conquests, the, doge, was, awarded, the, title, of, lord, of, a, quarter, and, a, half, of, the, eastern, roman, empire, thus, obtaining, the, faculty, of, appointing, the, latin, patriarchate, of, constantinople, and, the, possibility, of, sending, a, venetian, representative, to, the, government, of, the, eastern, latin, empire, with, the, end, of, the, fourth, crusade, venice, concentrated, its, efforts, on, the, conquest, of, crete, which, intensely, involved, the, venetian, army, until, 1237, venice, s, control, over, the, eastern, trade, routes, became, pressing, and, this, caused, an, increase, in, conflicts, with, genoa, which, in, 1255, exploded, into, the, war, of, saint, sabas, on, 24, june, 1258, the, two, republics, faced, each, other, in, the, battle, of, acre, which, ended, with, an, overwhelming, venetian, victory, in, 1261, the, empire, of, nicaea, with, the, help, of, the, republic, of, genoa, managed, to, dissolve, the, eastern, latin, empire, and, re, establish, the, byzantine, empire, the, war, between, genoa, and, venice, resumed, and, after, a, long, series, of, battles, the, war, ended, in, 1270, with, the, peace, of, cremona, in, 1281, venice, defeated, the, republic, of, ancona, in, battle, and, in, 1293, a, new, war, between, genoa, the, byzantine, empire, and, venice, broke, out, won, by, the, genoese, following, the, battle, of, curzola, and, ending, in, 1299, during, the, war, various, administrative, reforms, were, implemented, in, venice, new, assemblies, were, established, to, replace, popular, ones, such, as, the, senate, and, in, the, great, council, power, began, to, concentrate, in, the, hands, of, about, ten, families, to, avoid, the, birth, of, a, lordship, the, doge, decided, to, increase, the, number, of, members, of, the, maggior, consiglio, while, leaving, the, number, of, families, unchanged, and, so, the, serrata, del, maggior, consiglio, was, implemented, in, 1297, following, the, provision, the, power, of, some, of, the, old, houses, decreased, and, in, 1310, under, the, pretext, of, defeat, in, the, ferrara, war, these, families, organized, themselves, in, the, tiepolo, conspiracy, once, the, coup, d, tat, failed, and, the, establishment, of, a, lordship, was, averted, doge, pietro, gradenigo, established, the, council, of, ten, which, was, assigned, the, task, of, repressing, any, threat, to, the, security, of, the, state, in, the, venetian, hinterland, the, war, waged, by, mastino, ii, della, scala, caused, serious, economic, losses, to, venetian, trade, so, in, 1336, venice, gave, birth, to, the, anti, scaliger, league, the, following, year, the, coalition, expanded, further, and, padua, returned, to, the, dominion, of, the, carraresi, in, 1338, venice, conquered, treviso, the, first, nucleus, of, the, domini, di, terraferma, and, in, 1339, it, signed, a, peace, treaty, in, which, the, scaligeri, promised, not, to, interfere, in, venetian, trade, and, to, recognize, the, sovereignty, of, venice, over, the, trevisan, march, in, 1343, venice, took, part, in, the, smyrniote, crusades, but, its, participation, was, suspended, due, to, the, siege, of, zadar, by, the, hungarians, the, genoese, expansion, to, the, east, which, caused, the, black, death, brought, the, rivalry, between, the, two, republics, to, resurface, and, in, 1350, they, faced, each, other, in, the, war, of, the, straits, following, the, defeat, in, the, battle, of, sapienza, doge, marino, faliero, attempted, to, establish, a, city, lordship, but, the, coup, d, tat, was, foiled, by, the, council, of, ten, which, on, 17, april, 1355, condemned, the, doge, to, death, the, ensuing, political, instability, convinced, louis, i, of, hungary, to, attack, dalmatia, which, was, conquered, in, 1358, with, the, signing, of, the, treaty, of, zadar, the, weakness, of, the, republic, pushed, crete, and, trieste, to, revolt, but, the, rebellions, were, quelled, thus, reaffirming, venetian, dominion, over, the, stato, da, m, r, the, skirmishes, between, the, venetians, and, the, genoese, resumed, and, in, 1378, the, two, republics, faced, each, other, in, the, war, of, chioggia, initially, the, genoese, managed, to, conquer, chioggia, and, vast, areas, of, the, venetian, lagoon, but, in, the, end, it, was, the, venetians, who, prevailed, the, war, ended, definitively, on, 8, august, 1381, with, the, treaty, of, turin, which, sanctioned, the, exit, of, the, genoese, from, the, competition, for, dominion, over, the, mediterranean, in, 1403, the, last, major, battle, between, the, genoese, now, under, french, rule, and, venice, was, fought, at, modon, and, the, final, victory, resulted, in, maritime, hegemony, and, dominance, of, the, eastern, trade, routes, the, latter, would, soon, be, contested, however, by, the, inexorable, rise, of, the, ottoman, empire, hostilities, began, after, prince, mehmed, i, ended, the, civil, war, of, the, ottoman, interregnum, and, established, himself, as, sultan, the, conflict, escalated, until, pietro, loredan, won, a, crushing, victory, against, the, turks, off, gallipoli, in, 1416, venice, expanded, as, well, along, the, dalmatian, coast, from, istria, to, albania, which, was, acquired, from, king, ladislaus, of, naples, during, the, civil, war, in, hungary, ladislaus, was, about, to, lose, the, conflict, and, had, decided, to, escape, to, naples, but, before, doing, so, he, agreed, to, sell, his, now, practically, forfeit, rights, on, the, dalmatian, cities, for, the, reduced, sum, of, 100, 000, ducats, venice, exploited, the, situation, and, quickly, installed, nobility, to, govern, the, area, for, example, count, filippo, stipanov, in, zara, this, move, by, the, venetians, was, a, response, to, the, threatening, expansion, of, gian, galeazzo, visconti, duke, of, milan, control, over, the, northeast, main, land, routes, was, also, a, necessity, for, the, safety, of, the, trades, by, 1410, venice, had, a, navy, of, 3, 300, ships, manned, by, 36, 000, men, and, had, taken, over, most, of, what, is, now, the, veneto, including, the, cities, of, verona, which, swore, its, loyalty, in, the, devotion, of, verona, to, venice, in, 1405, and, padua, slaves, were, plentiful, in, the, italian, city, states, as, late, as, the, 15th, century, the, venetian, slave, trade, was, divided, in, to, the, balkan, slave, trade, and, the, black, sea, slave, trade, between, 1414, and, 1423, some, 10, 000, slaves, imported, from, caffa, via, the, black, sea, slave, trade, were, sold, in, venice, in, the, early, 15th, century, the, republic, began, to, expand, onto, the, terraferma, thus, vicenza, belluno, and, feltre, were, acquired, in, 1404, and, padua, verona, and, este, in, 1405, the, situation, in, dalmatia, had, been, settled, in, 1408, by, a, truce, with,

origin, each, with, its, own, synagogue, after, the, plague, the, ghetto, was, repopulated, by, some, eastern, european, jews, and, in, 1633, the, ghetto, was, expanded, but, in, the, meantime, venice, had, lost, its, centrality, and, the, jewish, community, also, began, to, shrink, taxes, towards, it, increased, and, sectarian, movements, began, to, arise, the, situation, declined, until, in, 1737, the, community, declared, bankruptcy, printing, and, other, graphic, arts, constituted, a, thriving, economic, sector, of, the, republic, and, the, main, means, of, disseminating, venetian, knowledge, and, discoveries, in, the, technical, humanistic, and, scientific, fields, the, birth, of, venetian, publishing, dates, back, to, the, 15th, century, in, particular, to, 18, september, 1469, when, through, the, efforts, of, the, german, johann, of, speyer, the, venetian, government, passed, the, first, law, to, protect, publishers, by, granting, a, printing, privilege, which, gave, the, publisher, the, exclusive, right, to, print, certain, works, in, addition, to, the, german, community, the, french, community, led, by, nicolas, jenson, also, owned, most, of, the, venetian, printing, presses, towards, the, end, of, the, 15th, century, between, 1495, and, 1515, aldus, manutius, further, developed, venetian, publishing, via, three, innovations, which, later, spread, throughout, europe, the, octavo, format, the, italic, character, and, the, hooked, comma, these, inventions, allowed, him, to, become, the, largest, venetian, publisher, and, consequently, attracted, the, major, humanists, of, the, time, including, pietro, bembo, and, erasmus, after, manutius, many, other, italian, entrepreneurs, such, as, the, florentine, lucantonio, giunti, opened, printing, presses, in, venice, which, towards, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, reached, 200, businesses, each, with, higher, book, circulations, than, the, average, for, european, cities, the, large, quantity, of, printing, houses, scattered, throughout, the, venetian, territory, made, the, city, of, venice, a, leader, in, the, sector, so, much, so, that, in, the, last, twenty, years, of, the, 15th, century, one, book, in, ten, in, europe, was, printed, in, venice, book, production, in, venice, was, encouraged, not, only, by, the, rules, in, favor, of, publishers, but, also, by, the, lack, of, censorship, in, the, 16th, century, works, prohibited, in, the, rest, of, europe, such, as, the, lustful, sonnets, were, printed, in, venice, the, republic, of, venice, recognized, catholicism, as, the, state, religion, and, while, remaining, relatively, tolerant, compared, to, other, confessions, there, were, many, laws, in, favor, of, catholic, traditions, given, that, according, the,

the, dioceses, of, jesolo, torcello, and, caorle, during, the, history, of, the, republic, of, venice, the, cathedral, of, the, patriarchate, was, the, basilica, of, san, pietro, di, castello, which, was, changed, to, st, mark, only, in, 1807, ten, years, after, the, fall, of, the, republic, during, the, period, of, the, counter, reformation, the, inquisition, was, also, active, in, the, republic, of, venice, which, from, 1542, to, 1794, tried, 3, 620, defendants, including, giordano, bruno, pier, paolo, vergerio, and, marco, antonio, de, dominis, crimes, relating, to, faith, such, as, witchcraft, were, regulated, by, a, secular, court, as, early, as, 1181, during, the, regency, of, doge, orio, mastropiero, the, tribunal, in, addition, to, being, made, up, of, its, judges, appointed, by, the, doge, also, availed, itself, of, the, help, of, the, bishops, and, the, patriarch, of, grado, and, the, most, widespread, punishment, for, those, convicted, was, that, of, being, burned, at, the, stake, these, magistrates, continued, to, intervene, as, lay, members, even, in, the, trials, of, the, inquisition, often, coming, into, conflict, with, the, church, and, sometimes, mitigating, the, harshness, of, the, punishment, furthermore, the, inquisition, only, had, power, over, christians, and, not, over, members, of, other, confessions, such, as, jews, the, government, also, regulated, the, construction, of, places, of, worship, limited, bequests, to, the, church, favored, by, the, presence, of, parish, priests, notaries, and, controlled, priests, who, preached, against, the, government, sometimes, expelling, them, from, the, state, in, addition, to, the, catholic, faith, in, the, republic, of, venice, particularly, in, the, stato, da, mar, the, orthodox, church, was, also, present, according, to, the, 1770, census, the, orthodox, greeks, constituted, approximately, 13, 3, of, the, population, the, greek, orthodox, community, was, also, present, in, the, capital, and, in, 1456, the, greeks, obtained, permission, to, build, the, church, of, san, biagio, in, venice, the, only, church, in, the, city, where, they, could, celebrate, their, rites, in, 1514, due, to, overcrowding, of, san, biagio, the, construction, of, the, church, of, san, giorgio, dei, greci, was, permitted, the, remaining, population, belonged, to, other, churches, such, as, the, protestant, and, the, armenian, catholic, churches, and, there, were, also, islamic, merchants, who, however, did, not, reside, permanently, in, venice, the, armenians, settled, in, venice, as, early, as, the, mid, 13th, century, although, the, construction, of, the, first, armenian, catholic, church, the, church, of, santa, croce, degli, armeni, dates, back, only, to, 1682, san, lazzaro, degli, armeni, also, served, as, the, armenians, main, cultural, center, the, protestant, religion, which, could, be, practiced, freely, also, spread, in, the, republic, of, venice, through,

1657, they, were, allowed, to, celebrate, masses, with, german, shepherds, in, the, fondaco, dei, tedeschi, in, venice, there, was, also, the, fondaco, dei, turchi, where, the, ottoman, merchants, spent, their, time, and, in, which, there, was, a, small, mosque, the, only, place, of, prayer, for, the, muslim, faithful, who, stayed, in, venice, in, 1770, there, were, only, 5, 026, jews, equal, to, approximately, 0, 2, of, the, republic, of, venice, s, population, but, various, laws, were, promulgated, for, this, minority, which, limited, their, relationship, with, catholics, and, their, civil, liberties, following, the, expulsion, of, the, jews, in, almost, all, of, europe, the, jews, of, venice, were, allowed, to, remain, in, the, ghetto, so, as, not, to, create, disorder, in, the, city, and, to, be, able, to, carry, out, their, traditions, and, pray, in, the, synagogues, in, venice, there, were, five, synagogues, belonging, to, the, different, venetian, jewish, communities, also, called, universities, or, nations, which, held, the, liturgy, here, following, different, rites, for, each, synagogue, since, the, first, settlements, fishing, played, a, fundamental, role, in, the, livelihood, of, the, lagoon, communities, fishing, was, one, of, the, most, widespread, activities, among, the, common, people, who, also, dedicated, themselves, to, fish, farming, after, being, caught, the, fish, was, salted, to, improve, preservation, in, addition, to, fishing, although, to, a, lesser, extent, hunting, fowling, and, pastoralism, were, widespread, but, were, limited, by, the, scarcity, of, pastures, in, the, dogado, since, pastures, in, the, lagoon, were, limited, agriculture, was, instead, widespread, mainly, with, vegetable, crops, and, some, vineyards, the, agricultural, products, of, which, were, sold, by, fruit, merchants, in, addition, to, fishing, lagoon, populations, heavily, relied, on, salt, extraction, for, their, livelihood, owing, to, the, salt, trade, the, first, lagoon, populations, were, able, to, purchase, goods, that, the, venetian, lagoon, did, not, produce, primarily, wheat, a, direct, competitor, in, the, production, of, salt, was, comacchio, which, was, destroyed, in, 932, and, its, population, transferred, to, the, venetian, lagoon, the, areas, of, greatest, production, were, the, northern, part, of, the, lagoon, and, the, district, of, chioggia, which, over, the, centuries, became, the, greatest, salt, producer, in, the, mediterranean, reaching, its, peak, in, the, 13th, century, most, of, the, salt, produced, in, chioggia, was, exported, to, italy, via, the, po, and, the, adige, the, salt, pans, were, made, up, of, a, series, of, dams, basins, and, canals, that, allowed, them, to, function, correctly, their, extension, was, notable, the, chioggia, salt, pans, occupied, an, area, of, approximately, 30, km, which, corresponded, to, ninety, times, the, size, of, the, city, the, impetus, for, the, foundations, construction, was, given, by, the, doge, and, the, great, ducal, families, who, held, the, property, the, estates, of, the, nobles, were, rented, to, the, families, of, the, salt, workers, who, independently, maintained, the, salt, pan, and, extracted, the, salt, the, owners, of, the, land, had, an, exclusively, economic, relationship, with, the, salt, workers, consequently, the, nobles, owners, of, the, land, could, not, consider, themselves, feudal, lords, as, was, the, case, in, the, rest, of, europe, in, the, cultivation, of, wheat, the, salt, workers, also, organized, consortia, which, made, noble, imposition, of, the, landowners, even, more, difficult, in, the, 14th, century, during, the, height, of, commercial, expansion, salt, production, in, the, lagoon, had, decreased, regardless, venice, maintained, a, monopoly, on, this, precious, commodity, by, requiring, merchants, to, transport, a, certain, percentage, of, salt, which, was, often, purchased, in, puglia, sicily, sardinia, the, balearic, islands, cyprus, and, on, the, coast, of, libya, venetian, glass, traded, as, early, as, the, 9th, century, in, the, form, of, sheets, is, still, considered, one, of, the, leading, products, of, the, venetian, industry, because, of, its, quality, venetian, glass, was, used, to, make, works, of, art, exported, all, over, the, world, its, production, was, located, solely, on, the, island, of, murano, to, avoid, the, spread, of, fires, within, the, capital, despite, the, glass, production, the, most, successful, activity, was, that, of, shipbuilding, which, took, place, within, the, state, arsenal, active, since, the, 12th, century, but, also, in, the, small, venetian, shipyards, of, the, city, alongside, the, construction, of, ships, the, production, of, naval, cordage, was, developed, by, the, filac, nevi, who, starting, from, the, 13th, century, imported, hemp, from, russia, via, the, black, sea, among, the, activities, already, widespread, in, the, 13th, century, were, tanneries, and, wool, spinning, which, were, exercised, in, giudecca, from, its, early, history, trade, was, the, basis, of, the, republic, of, venice, s, success, and, political, rise, in, 829, the, doge, giustiniano, participazio, was, involved, not, only, in, the, management, of, his, feudal, assets, but, also, in, commercial, affairs, by, sea, the, commercial, enterprises, of, venetian, citizens, increased, in, the, 12th, century, a, period, which, saw, the, creation, of, the, mude, caravans, of, merchant, galleys, which, escorted, by, armed, ships, headed, towards, the, eastern, markets, starting, with, that, of, constantinople, venice, had, a, privileged, relationship, with, the, byzantine, empire, starting, from, 1082, when, with, the, issuing, of, the, golden, bull, venetian, merchants, were, allowed, to, exchange, goods, with, the, byzantines, without, any, tax, and, to, establish, an, inhabited, nucleus, directly, in, the, capital, a, privilege, which, however, ended, violently, in, 1171, by, the, decree, of, manuel, i, komnenos, commercial, traffic, reached, its, peak, in, the, 13th, century, but, continued, to, be, fundamental, in, the, political, and, social, life, of, venice, until, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, this, period, saw, the, establishment, of, state, sanctioned, mude, convoys, of, ships, contracted, to, merchants, which, were, used, to, reach, faraway, lands, including, india, china, england, and, flanders, the, republic, s, trade, was, so, extensive, that, in, 1325, the, existence, of, venetian, settlements, was, noted, in, northern, european, cities, including, southampton, and, bruges, and, in, asian, cities, such, as, zaiton, sudak, azov, trabzon, and, amman, as, well, as, other, settlements, on, the, shores, of, the, aral, sea, venetian, trade, suffered, a, sharp, decline, at, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, when, competition, from, the, portuguese, spanish, english, and, dutch, became, suffocating, for, venetian, merchants, the, goods, that, the, venetians, exchanged, mostly, by, sea, and, which, crowded, the, central, rialto, market, were, cotton, fabrics, iron, wood, alum, salt, and, spices, exchanged, as, early, as, the, 9th, century, the, testament, of, bishop, orso, participazio, in, which, pepper, is, mentioned, dates, back, to, 853, in, addition, to, pepper, venice, traded, large, quantities, of, cinnamon, cumin, coriander, cloves, and, many, other, spices, which, played, a, fundamental, role, in, the, preservation, of, meat, for, the, flavoring, of, wines, and, for, medical, treatments, of, which, venetian, medicine, made, a, large, use, spices, also, include, sugar, produced, in, cyprus, and, refined, in, venice, and, all, the, perfumes, and, incenses, widely, used, by, venetian, patricians, and, during, religious, functions, in, addition, to, spices, the, east, also, supplied, precious, stones, and, silk, vice, versa, venice, brought, european, metals, wood, leather, and, fabrics, to, the, east, another, good, of, which, venice, held, a, monopoly, was, salt, which, was, shared, wherever, there, was, some, and, given, its, usefulness, the, republic, obliged, every, merchant, to, transport, a, certain, quantity, the, salt, monopoly, as, well, as, being, a, commercial, privilege, was, also, a, political, deterrent, against, foreign, nations, another, commodity, of, fundamental, importance, was, the, cereals, which, were, managed, by, the, wheat, chamber, to, combat, possible, famines, there, was, also, a, large, import, of, oil, used, not, only, in, seasoning, but, also, for, lighting, the, great, expansion, of, venetian, trade, began, in, the, 12th, century, and, the, need, for, a, stable, currency, became, increasingly, urgent, in, 1202, during, the, dogate, of, enrico, dandolo, the, minting, of, the, silver, ducat, later, called, matapan, began, which, quickly, spread, throughout, the, mediterranean, basin, the, ducat, corresponded, to, 26, denarii, and, weighed, approximately, two, grams, like, the, other, coins, of, the, republic, of, venice, the, ducat, had, the, effigy, of, the, reigning, doge, who, held, the, standard, of, venice, in, front, of, saint, mark, on, 31, october, 1284, doge, giovanni, dandolo, decided, to, mint, a, new, currency, which, would, later, be, vital, in, the, venetian, economy, the, gold, sequin, or, ducat, the, sequin, made, of, excellent, purity, gold, weighed, approximately, 3, 5, grams, and, its, minting, was, interrupted, only, with, the, fall, of, the, republic, starting, from, the, 16th, century, minting, took, place, in, a, special, building, overlooking, the, marciano, pier, the, zecca, of, venice, over, whose, activity, the, council, of, forty, supervised, the, venetian, renaissance, was, one, of, the, fundamental, declinations, of, the, italian, renaissance, renaissance, art, arrived, in, veneto, through, donatello, s, stay, in, padua, from, 1443, to, 1453, later, spreading, to, painting, through, squarcione, and, his, students, shortly, afterwards, the, new, style, also, spread, to, venice, traditionally, linked, to, late, gothic, culture, following, giovanni, bellini, after, which, venetian, art, was, revolutionized, by, giorgione, and, at, the, beginning, of, the, sixteenth, century, by, titian, this, era, ends, with, veronese, and, tintoretto, the, latter, dying, in, 1594, who, marked, the, transition, towards, mannerism, until, the, 17th, century, theatrical, works, were, performed, in, noble, palaces, or, in, public, by, the, compagnie, della, calza, who, staged, their, works, on, mobile, wooden, theatres, during, the, 17th, century, there, was, a, great, diffusion, of, the, theater, so, much, so, that, in, 1637, venice, s, first, permanent, theater, the, teatro, san, cassiano, was, inaugurated, with, a, presentation, of, andromeda, by, benedetto, ferrari, over, the, course, of, the, century, thanks, to, the, financing, of, the, nobles, a, dozen, theaters, were, built, in, which, tragedies, and, melodramas, were, mainly, performed, in, venice, the, reform, of, melodrama, was, initiated, by,
