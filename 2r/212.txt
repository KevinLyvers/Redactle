class, in, contrast, to, the, peasants, they, could, own, land, but, were, obliged, to, defend, it, and, fight, for, the, king, with, the, rule, of, the, ottoman, empire, after, 1450, the, ottoman, as, well, as, the, austro, hungarian, terms, exchanged, the, serbian, one, today, it, is, an, archaic, term, representing, the, aristocracy, plemstvo, from, the, 9th, to, 13th, century, boyars, wielded, considerable, power, through, their, military, support, of, the, rus, s, princes, power, and, prestige, of, many, of, them, however, soon, came, to, depend, almost, completely, on, service, to, the, state, family, history, of, service, and, to, a, lesser, extent, land, ownership, boyars, of, kievan, rus, were, visually, very, similar, to, knights, but, after, the, mongol, invasion, their, cultural, links, were, mostly, lost, the, boyars, occupied, the, highest, state, offices, and, through, a, council, duma, advised, the, grand, duke, they, received, extensive, grants, of, land, and, as, members, of, the, boyars, duma, were, the, major, legislators, of, kievan, rus, after, the, mongol, invasion, in, the, 13th, century, the, boyars, from, western, and, southern, parts, of, kievan, rus, modern, belarus, and, ukraine, were, incorporated, into, lithuanian, and, polish, nobility, szlachta, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, many, of, those, rus, boyars, who, failed, to, get, the, status, of, a, nobleman, actively, participated, in, the, formation, of, the, cossack, army, boyars, in, novgorod, and, pskov, formed, a, sort, of, republic, where, the, power, of, princes, knyaz, was, strongly, limited, until, the, conquest, by, moscow, boyars, kept, their, influence, in, the, russian, principalities, of, vladimir, tver, and, moscow, only, after, the, centralization, of, power, by, moscow, was, the, power, of, the, boyars, diminished, during, the, 14th, and, 15th, centuries, the, boyars, of, moscow, had, considerable, influence, that, continued, from, the, muscovy, period, however, starting, with, the, reign, of, ivan, iii, the, boyars, were, starting, to, lose, that, influence, to, the, authoritative, tsars, in, muscovy, because, of, ivan, iii, s, expansionist, policies, administrative, changes, were, needed, in, order, to, ease, the, burden, of, governing, muscovy, small, principalities, knew, their, loyal, subjects, by, name, but, after, the, consolidation, of, territories, under, ivan, familial, loyalty, and, friendship, with, the, boyar, s, subjects, turned, those, same, subjects, into, administrative, lists, the, face, of, provincial, rule, disappeared, boyar, membership, until, the, 16th, century, did, not, necessarily, require, one, to, be, russian, or, even, orthodox, as, historians, note, that, many, boyars, came, from, places, like, lithuania, or, the, nogais, and, some, remained, muslims, for, a, generation, after, the, mongols, were, ousted, what, is, interesting, about, the, boyars, is, their, implied, duties, because, boyars, were, not, constitutionally, instituted, much, of, their, powers, and, duties, came, from, agreements, signed, between, princes, agreements, such, as, one, between, ivan, iii, and, mikhail, borisovich, in, 1484, showed, how, allegiances, needed, to, be, earned, and, secured, rather, than, implied, and, enforced, instead, of, the, grand, prince, personally, overseeing, his, lands, he, had, to, rely, on, his, captains, and, close, advisors, to, oversee, day, to, day, operations, instead, of, the, great, voice, the, boyars, had, previously, in, their, advisory, roles, they, now, had, less, bargaining, power, and, mobility, they, answered, questions, posed, by, the, grand, prince, and, ivan, iii, even, made, sure, to, get, their, approval, on, special, events, such, as, his, marriage, to, zoe, paleologa, or, the, attack, on, novgorod, this, was, to, ensure, the, boyars, and, their, military, power, remained, loyal, to, the, tsar, the, grand, duke, also, made, sure, that, peasants, could, not, leave, the, princes, lands, or, from, one, place, to, another, in, the, mid, 1400s, effectively, establishing, serfdom, the, boyars, gained, rewards, and, gifts, as, well, some, boyars, were, sent, to, regions, as, governors, and, could, feed, off, the, locals, in, this, way, still, by, the, end, of, the, 15th, century, boyar, membership, had, declined, and, merit, rather, than, family, background, decided, who, became, a, boyar, when, ivan, iv, became, the, tsar, more, radical, changes, were, implemented, to, limit, boyar, influence, ivan, iv, became, the, grand, prince, of, all, muscovy, in, 1533, at, the, age, of, three, but, various, boyar, factions, tried, to, compete, for, control, of, the, regency, when, ivan, iv, came, to, power, in, 1547, much, more, of, the, boyars, independent, political, power, became, obsolete, the, independence, and, autonomy, experienced, by, the, princes, of, the, regions, in, muscovy, was, abolished, under, ivan, iv, by, the, end, of, the, sixteenth, century, making, them, the, prince, s, sons, or, just, simple, boyars, serving, the, grand, prince, ivan, iv, divided, muscovy, into, two, parts, in, 1565, and, in, the, private, part, the, terror, began, the, boyars, attempted, to, band, together, and, resist, but, instead, of, constitutionally, establishing, their, role, in, government, ivan, iv, ruthlessly, crushed, the, boyar, opposition, with, the, use, of, the, oprichnina, terror, purges, land, grants, were, also, given, to, subjects, that, provided, military, service, and, soon, this, type, of, land, grant, became, the, more, common, compared, to, inherited, land, among, the, boyars, ivan, iv, consolidated, his, power, centralized, royal, power, and, made, every, effort, possible, to, curb, the, influence, of, the, princes, after, ivan, iv, a, time, of, troubles, began, when, his, son, fedor, died, without, an, heir, ending, the, rurik, dynasty, the, boyar, boris, godunov, tried, to, proclaim, himself, tsar, but, several, boyar, factions, refused, to, recognize, him, the, chaos, continued, after, the, first, false, dmitriy, gained, the, throne, and, civil, war, erupted, when, the, romanovs, took, over, the, seventeenth, century, became, one, filled, with, administrative, reform, a, comprehensive, legal, code, was, introduced, and, a, merging, of, the, boyars, into, the, elite, bureaucracy, was, beginning, to, form, by, the, end, of, the, time, of, troubles, the, boyars, had, lost, nearly, all, independent, power, instead, of, going, to, moscow, to, gain, more, power, the, boyars, felt, defeated, and, felt, compelled, to, go, to, moscow, to, maintain, a, united, and, strong, russia, second, the, boyars, lost, their, independent, principalities, where, they, maintained, all, their, power, and, instead, governed, districts, and, regions, under, the, grand, prince, of, the, time, boyars, also, lost, their, advisory, influence, over, the, grand, prince, with, tools, such, as, the, duma, and, instead, the, grand, prince, no, longer, felt, compelled, to, listen, to, the, demands, of, the, boyars, the, tsar, no, longer, feared, losing, their, military, support, and, unification, of, muscovy, became, paramount, in, importance, with, peter, the, great, the, final, nail, in, the, coffin, happened, for, the, boyar, s, power, and, they, would, never, recover, from, his, administrative, reforms, peter, the, great, who, took, power, in, 1697, took, it, upon, himself, to, westernize, russia, and, catch, it, up, with, the, modern, world, after, the, revolt, of, the, streltsy, regiments, in, 1698, peter, the, great, returned, to, russia, forcing, government, officials, and, those, that, were, financially, able, to, have, clean, shaven, faces, and, wear, western, clothing, peter, also, reformed, the, judicial, system, and, created, a, senate, with, members, appointed, by, him, replacing, the, old, council, of, boyars, that, originally, advised, the, tsar, this, move, he, made, was, one, of, many, that, dismantled, the, powers, and, status, the, boyars, previously, possessed, peter, was, driving, out, the, conservative, and, religious, faction, of, the, boyars, out, of, the, courts, and, instead, using, both, foreign, and, russian, officials, to, fill, the, administrative, system, several, boyars, as, well, as, other, nobility, spoke, out, against, these, reforms, including, historian, mikhail, shcherbatov, who, stated, that, the, reforms, peter, made, helped, destroy, russian, tradition, and, created, people, that, tried, to, worm, their, way, up, by, flattering, and, humoring, the, monarch, and, the, grandees, in, every, way, still, the, reforms, continued, as, by, this, point, the, tsar, possessed, too, much, power, and, russia, became, an, absolute, monarchy, more, and, more, with, each, ruler, the, galician, nobility, originally, were, called, boyars, with, the, annexation, of, galicia, by, the, kingdom, of, poland, as, the, result, of, the, galicia, volhynia, wars, local, boyars, were, equated, since, 1430, in, rights, along, with, polish, nobility, szlachta, a, great, number, of, boyars, fled, to, the, lands, of, great, duchy, of, lithuania, in, volhynia, and, podolia, in, the, carpathian, regions, inhabited, by, present, day, romanians, the, boyar, boier, class, emerged, from, the, chiefs, named, cneaz, leader, or, jude, judge, in, the, areas, north, of, the, danube, and, celnic, south, of, the, river, of, rural, communities, in, the, early, middle, ages, who, made, their, judicial, and, administrative, attributions, hereditary, and, gradually, expanded, them, upon, other, communities, they, were, approved, by, the, ottoman, empire, which, had, suzerainty, over, the, area, after, the, appearance, of, more, advanced, political, structures, in, the, area, their, privileged, status, had, to, be, confirmed, by, the, central, power, which, used, this, prerogative, to, include, in, the, boyar, class, individuals, that, distinguished, themselves, in, the, military, or, civilian, functions, they, performed, by, allocating, them, lands, from, the, princely, domains, historian, djuvara, explained, the, hypotheses, concerning, the, origin, of, the, romanians, such, as, advancing, the, theory, that, the, vast, majority, of, the, nobility, in, the, medieval, states, that, made, up, the, territory, of, modern, day, romania, was, of, cuman, origin, and, not, romanian, romanians, were, called, the, black, cumans, the, romanian, social, hierarchy, was, composed, of, boyar, mazil, turkish, mazul, r, ze, yeoman, freedman, and, rum, n, serf, being, a, boyar, implied, three, things, being, a, land, owner, having, serfs, and, having, a, military, and, or, administrative, function, a, boyar, could, have, a, state, function, and, or, a, court, function, these, functions, were, called, dreg, torie, or, boierie, only, the, prince, had, the, power, to, assign, a, boierie, landowners, with, serfs, but, no, function, were, categorized, as, mazil, but, were, still, considered, to, be, of, noble, origin, din, os, boieresc, literally, of, boyar, bone, small, landowners, who, possessed, a, domain, without, distinction, dev, lm, ie, were, called, mo, neni, r, ze, i, while, the, serfs, indentured, servants, were, called, rum, ni, although, functions, could, only, be, accorded, by, the, prince, and, were, not, hereditary, land, possession, was, hereditary, the, prince, could, give, land, to, somebody, but, could, not, take, it, from, its, possessor, except, for, serious, reasons, such, as, treason, therefore, there, were, two, kinds, of, boyars, those, whose, families, as, chiefs, of, the, ancient, rural, communities, had, held, land, before, the, formation, of, the, feudal, states, such, that, the, prince, merely, confirmed, their, preexisting, status, as, landowners, and, those, who, acquired, their, domain, from, a, princely, donation, or, who, had, inherited, it, from, an, ancestor, who, acquired, it, through, such, a, donation, cf, the, distinction, between, uradel, and, briefadel, in, the, holy, roman, empire, and, in, its, feudal, successor, regimes, during, the, phanariot, r, gime, there, were, also, boyars, who, had, no, land, at, all, but, only, a, function, this, way, the, number, of, boyars, could, be, increased, by, selling, functions, to, those, who, could, afford, them, the, close, alliance, between, the, boyar, condition, and, the, military, administrative, functions, led, to, a, confusion, aggravated, by, the, phanariots, these, functions, began, to, be, considered, as, noble, titles, like, in, the, occident, in, fact, this, was, not, at, all, the, case, traditionally, the, boyars, were, organized, in, three, states, boyars, of, the, first, second, and, third, states, for, example, there, was, a, first, or, a, grand, postelnic, a, second, postelnic, and, a, third, postelnic, each, one, with, his, different, obligations, and, rights, the, difference, of, condition, was, visible, even, in, the, vestimentation, or, physical, aspect, only, the, boyars, of, the, first, state, had, the, right, for, example, to, grow, a, beard, the, rest, being, entitled, only, to, a, mustache, within, the, class, of, the, boyars, of, the, first, state, there, was, the, subclass, of, the, grand, boyars, those, were, great, landowners, who, also, had, some, very, high, functions, such, as, the, function, of, great, vornic, above, those, grand, boyars, was, only, the, prince, usually, a, prince, was, a, boyar, before, his, election, or, appointment, as, prince, but, this, was, not, an, absolute, condition, initially, only, princely, descendants, could, be, elected, princes, during, the, phanariot, epoch, however, any, man, could, be, a, prince, if, appointed, by, the, sultan, and, rich, enough, to, buy, this, appointment, from, the, grand, vizier, during, the, ottoman, suzerainty, and, especially, during, the, phanariot, r, gime, the, title, of, prince, became, an, administrative, function, within, the, imperial, ottoman, hierarchy, and, thus, the, ultimate, form, of, boyardness, the, title, of, prince, of, wallachia, or, moldavia, was, equivalent, in, dignity, to, that, of, a, pasha, with, two, horse, tails, norwegian, composer, johan, halvorsen, wrote, a, march, entitled, bojarenes, inntogsmarsj, entry, march, of, the, boyars, known, in, norway, as, the, signal, tune, for, the, radio, programme, nskekonserten, edvard, grieg, arranged, it, for, solo, piano, august, strindberg, requests, that, this, piece, be, played, during, his, play, the, dance, of, death, part, one
