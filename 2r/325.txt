al, andalus, arabic, was, the, muslim, ruled, area, of, the, iberian, peninsula, the, term, is, used, by, modern, historians, for, the, former, islamic, states, in, modern, day, gibraltar, portugal, spain, and, southern, france, the, name, describes, the, different, muslim, states, that, controlled, these, territories, at, various, times, between, 711, and, 1492, at, its, greatest, geographical, extent, it, occupied, most, of, the, peninsula, and, part, of, present, day, southern, france, septimania, under, umayyad, rule, these, boundaries, changed, constantly, through, a, series, of, conquests, western, historiography, has, traditionally, characterized, as, the, reconquista, eventually, shrinking, to, the, south, and, finally, to, the, emirate, of, granada, as, a, political, domain, it, successively, constituted, a, province, of, the, umayyad, caliphate, initiated, by, the, caliph, al, walid, i, 711, 750, the, emirate, of, c, rdoba, c, 750, 929, the, caliphate, of, c, rdoba, 929, 1031, the, first, taifa, kingdoms, 1009, 1110, the, almoravid, empire, 1085, 1145, the, second, taifa, period, 1140, 1203, the, almohad, caliphate, 1147, 1238, the, third, taifa, period, 1232, 1287, and, ultimately, the, nasrid, emirate, of, granada, 1238, 1492, under, the, caliphate, of, c, rdoba, the, city, of, c, rdoba, became, one, of, the, leading, cultural, and, economic, centres, throughout, the, mediterranean, basin, europe, and, the, islamic, world, achievements, that, advanced, islamic, and, western, science, came, from, al, andalus, including, major, advances, in, trigonometry, jabir, ibn, aflah, astronomy, al, zarqali, surgery, al, zahrawi, pharmacology, ibn, zuhr, and, agronomy, ibn, bassal, and, ab, l, khayr, al, ishb, l, al, andalus, became, a, conduit, for, cultural, and, scientific, exchange, between, the, islamic, and, christian, worlds, for, much, of, its, history, al, andalus, existed, in, conflict, with, christian, kingdoms, to, the, north, after, the, fall, of, the, umayyad, caliphate, al, andalus, was, fragmented, into, minor, taifa, states, and, townships, attacks, from, the, christians, intensified, led, by, the, castilians, under, alfonso, vi, culminating, with, the, capture, of, toledo, in, 1085, the, almoravid, empire, intervened, and, repelled, the, christian, attacks, on, the, region, then, brought, al, andalus, under, direct, almoravid, rule, for, the, next, century, and, a, half, al, andalus, became, a, province, of, the, muslim, empires, of, the, almoravids, and, their, successors, the, almohads, both, based, in, marrakesh, ultimately, the, northern, christian, kingdoms, overpowered, the, muslim, states, to, the, south, with, the, fall, of, c, rdoba, in, 1236, most, of, the, south, quickly, fell, under, christian, rule, and, the, emirate, of, granada, became, a, tributary, state, of, the, kingdom, of, castile, two, years, later, in, 1249, the, portuguese, reconquista, culminated, with, the, conquest, of, the, algarve, by, afonso, iii, in, spain, the, reconquista, would, continue, until, the, late, 15th, century, leaving, granada, as, the, last, muslim, state, on, the, iberian, peninsula, on, january, 2, 1492, emir, muhammad, xii, surrendered, the, emirate, of, granada, to, queen, isabella, i, of, castile, completing, the, christian, reconquista, of, spain, the, toponym, al, andalus, is, first, attested, by, inscriptions, on, coins, minted, in, 716, by, the, new, muslim, government, of, iberia, these, coins, called, dinars, were, inscribed, in, both, latin, and, arabic, the, etymology, of, the, name, al, andalus, has, traditionally, been, derived, from, the, name, of, the, vandals, v, ndalos, in, spanish, v, ndalos, in, portuguese, since, the, 1980s, several, alternative, etymologies, have, challenged, this, tradition, in, 1986, joaqu, n, vallv, proposed, that, al, andalus, was, a, corruption, of, the, name, atlantis, heinz, halm, in, 1989, derived, the, name, from, a, gothic, term, landahlauts, and, in, 2002, georg, bossong, suggested, its, derivation, from, a, pre, roman, substrate, during, the, caliphate, of, the, umayyad, caliph, al, walid, i, the, commander, tariq, ibn, ziyad, led, an, army, of, 7, 000, that, landed, at, gibraltar, on, april, 30, 711, ostensibly, to, intervene, in, a, visigothic, civil, war, after, a, decisive, victory, over, king, roderic, at, the, battle, of, guadalete, on, july, 19, 711, tariq, accompanied, by, his, mawla, governor, musa, ibn, nusayr, of, ifriqiya, brought, most, of, the, visigothic, kingdom, under, muslim, rule, in, a, seven, year, campaign, they, crossed, the, pyrenees, and, occupied, visigothic, septimania, in, southern, france, most, of, the, iberian, peninsula, became, part, of, the, expanding, umayyad, empire, under, the, name, of, al, andalus, it, was, organized, as, a, province, subordinate, to, ifriqiya, so, for, the, first, few, decades, the, governors, of, al, andalus, were, appointed, by, the, emir, of, kairouan, rather, than, the, caliph, in, damascus, the, regional, capital, was, set, at, c, rdoba, and, the, first, influx, of, muslim, settlers, was, widely, distributed, following, the, muslim, conquest, of, spain, al, andalus, then, at, its, greatest, extent, was, divided, into, five, administrative, units, corresponding, roughly, to, modern, andalusia, castile, and, le, n, navarre, aragon, and, catalonia, portugal, and, galicia, and, the, languedoc, roussillon, area, of, occitania, the, small, army, tariq, led, in, the, initial, conquest, consisted, mostly, of, berbers, while, musa, s, largely, arab, force, of, over, 12, 000, soldiers, was, accompanied, by, a, group, of, maw, l, arabic, that, is, non, arab, muslims, who, were, clients, of, the, arabs, the, berber, soldiers, accompanying, tariq, were, garrisoned, in, the, centre, and, the, north, of, the, peninsula, as, well, as, in, the, pyrenees, while, the, berber, colonists, who, followed, settled, in, all, parts, of, the, country, north, east, south, and, west, visigothic, lords, who, agreed, to, recognize, muslim, suzerainty, were, allowed, to, retain, their, fiefs, notably, in, murcia, galicia, and, the, ebro, valley, resistant, visigoths, took, refuge, in, the, cantabrian, highlands, where, they, carved, out, a, rump, state, the, kingdom, of, asturias, in, the, 720s, the, al, andalus, governors, launched, several, sa, ifa, raids, into, aquitaine, but, were, decisively, defeated, by, duke, odo, the, great, of, aquitaine, at, the, battle, of, toulouse, 721, however, after, crushing, odo, s, berber, ally, uthman, ibn, naissa, on, the, eastern, pyrenees, abdul, rahman, al, ghafiqi, led, an, expedition, north, across, the, western, pyrenees, and, defeated, the, aquitanian, duke, who, in, turn, appealed, to, the, frankish, leader, charles, martel, for, assistance, offering, to, place, himself, under, carolingian, sovereignty, at, the, battle, of, poitiers, in, 732, the, al, andalus, raiding, army, was, defeated, by, charles, martel, and, al, ghafiqi, was, killed, in, 734, the, andalusi, launched, raids, to, the, east, capturing, avignon, and, arles, and, overran, much, of, provence, in, 737, they, traveled, up, the, rh, ne, valley, reaching, as, far, north, as, burgundy, charles, martel, of, the, franks, with, the, assistance, of, liutprand, of, the, lombards, invaded, burgundy, and, provence, and, expelled, the, raiders, by, 739, in, 740, a, berber, revolt, erupted, in, the, maghreb, north, africa, to, put, down, the, rebellion, the, umayyad, caliph, hisham, dispatched, a, large, arab, army, composed, of, regiments, junds, of, bilad, ash, sham, to, north, africa, but, the, great, umayyad, army, was, crushed, by, the, berber, rebels, at, the, battle, of, bagdoura, in, morocco, heartened, by, the, victories, of, their, north, african, brethren, the, berbers, of, al, andalus, quickly, raised, their, own, revolt, berber, garrisons, in, the, north, of, the, iberian, peninsula, mutinied, deposed, their, arab, commanders, and, organized, a, large, rebel, army, to, march, against, the, strongholds, of, toledo, c, rdoba, and, algeciras, in, 741, balj, b, bishr, led, a, detachment, of, some, 10, 000, arab, troops, across, the, straits, the, arab, governor, of, al, andalus, joined, by, this, force, crushed, the, berber, rebels, in, a, series, of, ferocious, battles, in, 742, however, a, quarrel, immediately, erupted, between, the, syrian, commanders, and, the, andalusi, the, so, called, original, arabs, of, the, earlier, contingents, the, syrians, defeated, them, at, the, hard, fought, battle, of, aqua, portora, in, august, 742, but, were, too, few, to, impose, themselves, on, the, province, the, quarrel, was, settled, in, 743, when, ab, l, kha, r, al, us, m, the, new, governor, of, al, andalus, assigned, the, syrians, to, regimental, fiefs, across, al, andalus, the, damascus, jund, was, established, in, elvira, granada, the, jordan, jund, in, rayyu, m, laga, and, archidona, the, jund, filastin, in, medina, sidonia, and, jerez, the, emesa, hims, jund, in, seville, and, niebla, and, the, qinnasrin, jund, in, ja, n, the, egypt, jund, was, divided, between, beja, alentejo, in, the, west, and, tudmir, murcia, in, the, east, the, arrival, of, the, syrians, substantially, increased, the, arab, element, in, the, iberian, peninsula, and, helped, strengthen, the, muslim, hold, on, the, south, however, at, the, same, time, unwilling, to, be, governed, the, syrian, junds, carried, on, an, existence, of, autonomous, feudal, anarchy, severely, destabilizing, the, authority, of, the, governor, of, al, andalus, a, second, significant, consequence, of, the, revolt, was, the, expansion, of, the, kingdom, of, the, asturias, hitherto, confined, to, enclaves, in, the, cantabrian, highlands, after, the, rebellious, berber, garrisons, evacuated, the, northern, frontier, fortresses, the, christian, king, alfonso, i, of, asturias, set, about, immediately, seizing, the, empty, forts, for, himself, quickly, adding, the, northwestern, provinces, of, galicia, and, le, n, to, his, fledgling, kingdom, the, asturians, evacuated, the, christian, populations, from, the, towns, and, villages, of, the, galician, leonese, lowlands, creating, an, empty, buffer, zone, in, the, douro, river, valley, the, desert, of, the, duero, this, newly, emptied, frontier, remained, roughly, in, place, for, the, next, few, centuries, as, the, boundary, between, the, christian, north, and, the, islamic, south, between, this, frontier, and, its, heartland, in, the, south, the, al, andalus, state, had, three, large, march, territories, thughur, the, lower, march, capital, initially, at, m, rida, later, badajoz, the, middle, march, centred, at, toledo, and, the, upper, march, centred, at, zaragoza, these, disturbances, and, disorder, also, allowed, the, franks, now, under, the, leadership, of, pepin, the, short, to, invade, the, strategic, strip, of, septimania, in, 752, hoping, to, deprive, al, andalus, of, an, easy, launching, pad, for, raids, into, francia, after, a, lengthy, siege, the, last, arab, stronghold, the, citadel, of, narbonne, finally, fell, to, the, franks, in, 759, al, andalus, was, sealed, off, at, the, pyrenees, the, third, consequence, of, the, berber, revolt, was, the, collapse, of, the, authority, of, the, damascus, caliphate, over, the, western, provinces, with, the, umayyad, caliphs, distracted, by, the, challenge, of, the, abbasids, in, the, east, the, western, provinces, of, the, maghreb, and, al, andalus, spun, out, of, their, control, from, around, 745, the, fihrids, an, illustrious, local, arab, clan, descended, from, oqba, ibn, nafi, al, fihri, seized, power, in, the, western, provinces, and, ruled, them, almost, as, a, private, family, empire, of, their, own, abd, al, rahman, ibn, habib, al, fihri, in, ifriqiya, and, y, suf, al, fihri, in, al, andalus, the, fihrids, welcomed, the, fall, of, the, umayyads, in, the, east, in, 750, and, sought, to, reach, an, understanding, with, the, abbasids, hoping, they, might, be, allowed, to, continue, their, autonomous, existence, but, when, the, abbasids, rejected, the, offer, and, demanded, submission, the, fihrids, declared, independence, and, probably, out, of, spite, invited, the, deposed, remnants, of, the, umayyad, clan, to, take, refuge, in, their, dominions, it, was, a, fateful, decision, that, they, soon, regretted, for, the, umayyads, the, sons, and, grandsons, of, caliphs, had, a, more, legitimate, claim, to, rule, than, the, fihrids, themselves, rebellious, minded, local, lords, disenchanted, with, the, autocratic, rule, of, the, fihrids, conspired, with, the, arriving, umayyad, exiles, in, 755, the, exiled, umayyad, prince, abd, al, rahman, i, also, called, al, d, khil, the, immigrant, arrived, on, the, coast, of, spain, he, had, fled, the, abbasids, who, had, overthrown, the, umayyads, in, damascus, and, were, slaughtering, members, of, that, family, and, then, he, spent, four, years, in, exile, in, north, africa, assessing, the, political, situation, in, al, andalus, across, the, straits, of, gibraltar, before, he, landed, at, almu, car, news, of, his, arrival, spread, across, al, andalus, and, when, word, reached, its, governor, y, suf, al, fihri, he, was, not, pleased, during, this, time, abd, al, rahman, and, his, supporters, quickly, conquered, m, laga, and, then, seville, finally, besieging, the, capital, of, al, andalus, c, rdoba, abd, al, rahman, s, army, was, exhausted, after, their, conquest, meanwhile, governor, y, suf, al, fihri, had, returned, from, quashing, another, rebellion, with, his, army, the, siege, of, c, rdoba, began, and, noticing, the, starving, state, of, abd, al, rahman, s, army, al, fihri, began, throwing, lavish, feasts, every, day, as, the, siege, went, on, to, tempt, abd, al, rahman, s, supporters, to, defect, to, his, side, however, abd, al, rahman, persisted, even, rejecting, a, truce, that, would, have, allowed, abd, al, rahman, to, marry, al, fihri, s, daughter, after, decisively, defeating, y, suf, al, fihri, s, army, abd, al, rahman, was, able, to, conquer, c, rdoba, where, he, proclaimed, himself, emir, in, 756, the, rest, of, iberia, was, easily, conquered, and, abd, al, rahman, soon, had, control, of, all, of, iberia, abd, al, rahman, s, rule, was, stable, in, the, years, after, his, conquest, he, built, major, public, works, most, famously, the, mosque, of, c, rdoba, and, helped, urbanize, the, emirate, while, defending, it, from, invaders, including, the, quashing, of, numerous, rebellions, and, decisively, repelling, the, invasion, by, charlemagne, which, would, later, inspire, the, epic, chanson, de, roland, by, far, the, most, important, of, these, invasions, was, the, attempted, reconquest, by, the, abbasid, caliphate, in, 763, caliph, al, mansur, of, the, abbasids, installed, al, ala, ibn, mugith, as, governor, of, africa, whose, title, gave, him, dominion, over, the, province, of, al, andalus, he, planned, to, invade, and, destroy, the, emirate, of, c, rdoba, so, in, response, abd, al, rahman, fortified, himself, within, the, fortress, of, carmona, with, a, tenth, as, many, soldiers, as, al, ala, ibn, mugith, after, a, long, siege, it, appeared, that, abd, al, rahman, would, be, defeated, but, in, a, last, stand, abd, al, rahman, with, his, outnumbered, forces, opened, the, gates, of, the, fortress, and, charged, at, the, resting, abbasid, army, and, decisively, defeated, them, after, being, sent, the, embalmed, head, of, al, ala, ibn, mugith, it, is, said, al, mansur, exclaimed, praise, be, to, god, who, has, put, the, sea, between, me, and, this, devil, abd, al, rahman, i, died, in, 788, after, a, lengthy, and, prosperous, reign, he, was, succeeded, by, his, son, hisham, i, who, secured, power, by, exiling, his, brother, who, had, tried, to, rebel, against, him, hisham, enjoyed, a, stable, reign, of, eight, years, and, was, succeeded, by, his, son, al, hakam, i, the, next, few, decades, were, relatively, uneventful, with, only, occasional, minor, rebellions, and, saw, the, rise, of, the, emirate, in, 822, al, hakam, died, and, was, succeeded, by, abd, al, rahman, ii, the, first, great, emir, of, c, rdoba, he, rose, to, power, with, no, opposition, and, sought, to, reform, the, emirate, he, quickly, reorganized, the, bureaucracy, to, be, more, efficient, and, built, many, mosques, across, the, emirate, during, his, reign, science, and, art, flourished, as, many, scholars, fled, the, abbasid, caliphate, due, to, the, disastrous, fourth, fitna, the, scholar, abbas, ibn, firnas, made, an, attempt, to, fly, though, accounts, vary, on, his, success, in, 852, abd, al, rahman, ii, died, leaving, behind, him, a, powerful, and, well, established, state, that, had, become, one, of, the, most, powerful, in, the, mediterranean, abd, al, rahman, was, succeeded, by, muhammad, i, of, c, rdoba, who, according, to, legend, had, to, wear, women, s, clothing, to, sneak, into, the, imperial, palace, and, be, crowned, since, he, was, not, the, heir, apparent, his, reign, marked, a, decline, in, the, emirate, which, was, ended, by, abd, al, rahman, iii, his, reign, was, marked, by, multiple, rebellions, which, were, dealt, with, poorly, and, weakened, the, emirate, most, disastrously, following, the, rebellion, of, umar, ibn, hafsun, when, muhammad, died, he, was, succeeded, by, emir, abdullah, ibn, muhammad, al, umawi, whose, power, barely, reached, outside, of, the, city, of, c, rdoba, as, ibn, hafsun, ravaged, the, south, abdullah, did, almost, nothing, and, slowly, became, more, and, more, isolated, barely, speaking, to, anyone, abdullah, purged, his, administration, of, his, brothers, which, lessened, the, bureaucracy, s, loyalty, towards, him, around, this, time, several, local, arab, lords, began, to, revolt, including, one, kurayb, ibn, khaldun, who, was, able, to, conquer, seville, some, loyalists, tried, to, quell, the, rebellion, but, without, proper, material, support, their, efforts, were, in, vain, he, declared, that, the, next, emir, would, be, his, grandson, abd, al, rahman, iii, ignoring, the, claims, of, his, four, living, children, abdullah, died, in, 912, and, the, throne, passed, to, abd, al, rahman, iii, through, force, of, arms, and, diplomacy, he, put, down, the, rebellions, that, had, disrupted, his, grandfather, s, reign, obliterating, ibn, hafsun, and, hunting, down, his, sons, after, this, he, led, several, sieges, against, the, christians, sacking, the, city, of, pamplona, and, restoring, some, prestige, to, the, emirate, meanwhile, across, the, sea, the, fatimids, had, risen, up, in, force, ousted, the, abbasid, government, in, north, africa, and, declared, themselves, a, caliphate, inspired, by, this, action, abd, al, rahman, joined, the, rebellion, and, declared, himself, caliph, in, 929, for, nearly, 100, years, under, the, c, rdoban, umayyad, period, from, the, 9th, century, to, the, 10th, al, andalus, also, extended, its, presence, from, fraxinetum, into, the, alps, with, a, series, of, organized, raids, the, period, of, the, caliphate, is, seen, as, the, golden, age, of, al, andalus, c, rdoba, under, the, caliphate, with, a, population, of, more, than, half, a, million, eventually, overtook, constantinople, as, the, largest, and, most, prosperous, city, in, europe, al, andalus, became, a, centre, for, the, arts, medicine, science, music, literature, and, philosophy, the, work, of, its, most, important, philosophers, and, scientists, such, as, abulcasis, and, averroes, had, a, major, influence, on, the, intellectual, life, of, medieval, europe, muslims, and, non, muslims, often, came, from, abroad, to, study, at, the, libraries, and, universities, of, al, andalus, and, after, the, reconquest, of, toledo, several, translation, institutions, such, as, the, toledo, school, of, translators, were, established, for, translating, books, and, texts, from, arabic, into, latin, the, most, noted, figures, in, this, being, gerard, of, cremona, and, michael, scot, who, took, these, works, to, italy, the, transmission, of, ideas, significantly, affected, the, formation, of, the, european, renaissance, the, caliphate, of, c, rdoba, also, had, extensive, trade, with, other, parts, of, the, mediterranean, including, christian, parts, trade, goods, included, luxury, items, silk, ceramics, gold, essential, foodstuffs, grain, olive, oil, wine, and, containers, such, as, ceramics, for, storing, perishables, in, the, tenth, century, amalfitans, were, already, trading, fatimid, and, byzantine, silks, in, c, rdoba, later, references, to, amalfitan, merchants, were, sometimes, used, to, emphasize, the, previous, golden, age, of, c, rdoba, fatimid, egypt, was, a, supplier, of, many, luxury, goods, including, elephant, tusks, and, raw, or, carved, crystals, the, fatimids, were, traditionally, thought, to, be, the, only, supplier, of, such, goods, and, control, over, these, trade, routes, would, be, a, cause, for, conflict, between, the, umayyads, and, fatimids, the, caliphate, of, c, rdoba, effectively, collapsed, during, a, ruinous, civil, war, between, 1009, and, 1013, although, it, was, not, finally, abolished, until, 1031, when, al, andalus, broke, up, into, a, number, of, mostly, independent, mini, states, and, principalities, called, taifas, in, 1013, invading, berbers, sacked, c, rdoba, massacring, its, inhabitants, pillaging, the, city, and, burning, the, palace, complex, to, the, ground, the, largest, of, the, taifas, to, emerge, were, badajoz, batalyaws, toledo, ulay, ulah, zaragoza, saraqusta, and, granada, arn, ah, after, 1031, the, taifas, were, generally, too, weak, to, defend, themselves, against, repeated, raids, and, demands, for, tribute, from, the, christian, states, to, the, north, and, west, which, were, known, to, the, muslims, as, the, galician, nations, and, which, had, spread, from, their, initial, strongholds, in, galicia, asturias, cantabria, the, basque, country, and, the, carolingian, marca, hispanica, to, become, the, kingdoms, of, navarre, le, n, portugal, castile, and, aragon, and, the, county, of, barcelona, during, the, eleventh, century, several, centres, of, power, existed, among, the, taifas, and, the, political, situation, shifted, rapidly, before, the, rise, of, the, almoravids, from, africa, or, the, christians, from, the, north, the, abbadid, ruled, taifa, of, seville, succeeded, in, conquering, a, dozen, lesser, kingdoms, becoming, the, most, powerful, and, renowned, of, the, taifas, such, that, it, could, have, laid, claim, to, be, the, true, heir, to, the, caliphate, of, c, rdoba, the, taifas, were, vulnerable, and, divided, but, had, immense, wealth, during, its, prominence, the, taifa, of, seville, produced, technically, complex, lusterware, and, exerted, significant, influence, on, ceramic, production, across, al, andalus, in, the, 1080s, the, taifa, kingdoms, began, to, face, an, existential, threat, from, the, christian, kingdoms, to, the, north, as, alfonso, vi, of, castile, escalated, attacks, against, them, in, 1083, he, led, a, punitive, expedition, against, seville, that, reached, all, the, way, to, tarifa, at, the, southern, tip, of, al, andalus, in, 1085, he, annexed, toledo, a, turning, point, which, galvanized, the, remaining, taifa, leaders, into, seeking, outside, help, after, the, fall, of, toledo, most, of, the, major, taifa, rulers, agreed, to, request, the, intervention, of, the, almoravids, a, berber, empire, based, in, marrakesh, present, day, morocco, that, had, conquered, much, of, northwest, africa, the, almoravid, leader, yusuf, ibn, tashfin, led, several, campaigns, into, al, andalus, initially, in, defense, of, the, taifa, kingdoms, at, the, battle, of, sagrajas, or, battle, of, zallaqa, in, arabic, a, muslim, army, led, by, the, almoravids, soundly, defeated, alfonso, vi, by, 1090, however, yusuf, ibn, tashfin, was, disillusioned, with, the, disunity, of, the, taifa, leaders, and, he, returned, on, a, campaign, to, conquer, al, andalus, instead, most, of, the, taifas, except, for, zaragoza, were, annexed, by, 1094, valencia, which, had, come, under, the, control, of, el, cid, at, the, end, of, its, taifa, period, was, eventually, occupied, in, 1102, after, el, cid, s, death, zaragoza, was, annexed, in, 1110, modern, scholarship, has, sometimes, admitted, originality, in, north, african, architecture, but, according, to, yasser, tabbaa, historian, of, islamic, art, and, architecture, the, iberocentric, viewpoint, is, anachronistic, when, considering, the, political, and, cultural, environment, during, the, rule, of, the, almoravid, dynasty, the, rise, and, fall, of, the, almoravids, is, sometimes, seen, as, an, expression, of, ibn, khaldun, s, asabiyyah, paradigm, by, 1147, the, almoravids, were, overthrown, in, north, africa, by, the, almohads, another, berber, dynasty, under, the, leadership, of, abd, al, mu, min, as, almoravid, rule, collapsed, another, brief, period, of, taifa, kingdoms, followed, in, al, andalus, during, which, the, christian, kingdoms, expanded, southward, again, from, 1146, onward, the, almohads, intervened, and, took, control, of, al, andalus, one, of, abd, al, mu, min, s, successors, ya, qub, al, mansur, won, a, major, victory, over, the, castilian, alfonso, viii, at, the, battle, of, alarcos, in, 1195, in, 1212, a, coalition, of, christian, kings, under, the, leadership, of, alfonso, viii, defeated, the, almohads, at, the, battle, of, las, navas, de, tolosa, almohad, rule, was, diminished, in, prestige, and, in, 1228, the, almohad, caliph, al, ma, mun, withdrew, from, al, andalus, altogether, in, this, political, vacuum, a, new, wave, of, taifa, kingdoms, emerged, which, were, progressively, conquered, by, portugal, castile, and, aragon, c, rdoba, was, conquered, in, 1236, and, seville, was, conquered, in, 1248, some, muslim, city, states, such, as, murcia, and, niebla, survived, as, vassal, kingdoms, of, castile, until, the, 1260s, only, the, region, of, granada, remained, unconquered, from, the, mid, 13th, to, the, late, 15th, century, the, only, remaining, domain, of, al, andalus, was, the, emirate, of, granada, the, last, muslim, stronghold, in, the, iberian, peninsula, the, emirate, was, established, by, muhammad, ibn, al, ahmar, in, 1230, and, was, ruled, by, the, nasrid, dynasty, the, longest, reigning, dynasty, in, the, history, of, al, andalus, although, surrounded, by, castilian, lands, the, emirate, was, wealthy, through, being, tightly, integrated, in, mediterranean, trade, networks, and, enjoyed, a, period, of, considerable, cultural, and, economic, prosperity, despite, internal, conflicts, the, nasrids, of, granada, were, able, to, survive, in, part, by, playing, the, christian, kingdoms, of, the, north, against, each, other, while, at, other, times, soliciting, aid, from, the, marinids, a, new, berber, dynasty, ruling, in, north, africa, from, their, capital, in, fez, for, much, of, its, existence, granada, paid, tribute, to, the, castilian, kings, along, with, this, political, status, its, favorable, geographic, location, with, the, sierra, nevada, as, a, natural, barrier, helped, to, prolong, nasrid, rule, granada, also, accommodated, a, large, number, of, muslim, refugees, fleeing, the, reconquista, or, expelled, from, christian, controlled, territories, which, grew, the, city, and, the, emirate, s, population, the, city, even, became, one, of, the, largest, in, europe, throughout, the, 15th, century, in, terms, of, population, the, most, visible, legacy, of, the, nasrids, is, the, alhambra, their, fortified, palace, complex, partly, preserved, today, the, independent, nasrid, kingdom, was, also, a, trade, hub, between, the, atlantic, and, mediterranean, and, was, frequented, especially, by, genoese, merchants, the, marinids, intervened, in, the, south, of, the, iberian, peninsula, multiple, times, up, until, their, defeat, at, the, battle, of, r, o, salado, in, 1340, after, this, they, ceased, to, play, a, major, role, the, subsequent, internal, turmoil, within, castile, however, helped, nasrid, granada, to, enjoy, a, period, of, relative, external, peace, and, internal, prosperity, until, the, end, of, the, 14th, century, under, the, reigns, of, yusuf, i, r, 1333, 1354, and, muhammad, v, r, 1354, 1359, 1362, 1391, important, cultural, figures, such, as, ibn, al, khatib, ibn, zamrak, and, ibn, khaldun, all, served, in, the, nasrid, court, during, this, period, in, 1468, isabella, the, only, child, of, henry, iv, of, castile, married, ferdinand, the, son, of, john, ii, of, aragon, and, by, 1479, they, were, rulers, of, a, united, castile, and, aragon, this, development, meant, that, granada, could, no, longer, exploit, divisions, between, the, two, kingdoms, and, the, new, royal, couple, also, known, as, the, catholic, monarchs, were, united, in, their, intention, to, conquer, it, the, final, war, to, conquer, granada, began, in, earnest, in, 1482, year, by, year, the, christian, advance, captured, new, cities, and, fortresses, until, the, last, nasrid, ruler, muhammad, xii, known, as, boabdil, to, the, christians, formally, surrendered, granada, to, the, catholic, monarchs, on, 2, january, 1492, by, this, time, muslims, in, castile, numbered, half, a, million, after, the, fall, 100, 000, had, died, or, been, enslaved, 200, 000, emigrated, and, 200, 000, remained, as, the, residual, population, many, of, the, muslim, elite, including, muhammad, xii, who, had, been, given, the, area, of, the, alpujarras, mountains, as, a, principality, found, life, under, christian, rule, intolerable, and, passed, over, into, north, africa, under, the, conditions, of, the, capitulations, of, 1492, the, muslims, in, granada, were, to, be, allowed, to, continue, to, practice, their, religion, mass, forced, conversions, of, muslims, in, 1499, led, to, a, revolt, that, spread, to, alpujarras, and, the, mountains, of, ronda, after, this, uprising, the, capitulations, were, revoked, in, 1502, the, catholic, monarchs, decreed, the, forced, conversion, of, all, muslims, living, under, the, rule, of, the, crown, of, castile, although, in, the, kingdoms, of, aragon, and, valencia, both, now, part, of, spain, the, open, practice, of, islam, was, allowed, until, 1526, descendants, of, the, muslims, were, subject, to, expulsions, from, spain, between, 1609, and, 1614, see, expulsion, of, the, moriscos, the, last, mass, prosecution, against, moriscos, for, crypto, islamic, practices, occurred, in, granada, in, 1727, with, most, of, those, convicted, receiving, relatively, light, sentences, the, morisco, community, including, these, final, convicts, kept, their, identity, alive, at, least, through, the, late, eighteenth, century, there, was, much, scientific, activity, in, al, andalus, especially, in, the, fields, of, medicine, astronomy, mathematics, and, agronomy, at, the, same, time, andalusi, scholars, were, also, highly, active, in, philosophy, see, below, especially, in, the, field, of, logic, the, earliest, evidence, of, such, activities, in, al, andalus, dates, to, the, reign, of, abd, ar, rahman, ii, r, 822, 852, when, developments, were, spurred, by, exposure, to, older, works, translated, from, greek, persian, and, other, languages, scientific, studies, continued, to, be, pursued, in, the, following, centuries, though, certain, fields, and, subjects, thrived, more, depending, on, the, period, scholars, often, worked, in, many, different, and, overlapping, subjects, so, it, is, difficult, to, place, those, discussed, here, into, a, single, scientific, field, each, there, were, many, notable, surgeons, physicians, and, medical, scholars, from, al, andalus, including, ibn, al, baytar, d, 1248, abu, al, qasim, al, zahrawi, albucasis, d, 1013, muhammad, al, shafrah, d, 1360, abu, marwan, abd, al, malik, ibn, habib, d, 853, and, abu, marwan, ibn, zuhr, avenzoar, d, 1162, and, of, particular, note, is, al, zahrawi, who, is, considered, by, many, to, be, probably, the, greatest, physician, in, the, entire, history, of, western, islam, around, the, year, 1000, c, e, he, wrote, a, book, with, a, title, that, roughly, translates, to, the, arrangement, of, medical, knowledge, for, one, who, is, not, able, to, compile, a, book, for, himself, kitab, al, tasrif, li, man, ajiza, an, al, ta, alif, a, comprehensive, medical, encyclopedia, with, the, goal, of, summarizing, all, existing, medical, knowledge, and, eliminating, the, need, for, students, and, practitioners, to, rely, on, multiple, medical, texts, the, book, is, renowned, for, its, chapter, on, surgery, which, included, important, illustrations, of, surgical, instruments, as, well, as, sections, on, cauterization, on, incisions, venesection, and, wounds, and, on, bone, setting, for, hundreds, of, years, after, its, publication, it, was, one, of, the, most, widely, used, medical, texts, for, students, and, medical, practitioners, and, was, translated, into, hebrew, latin, and, castilian, this, encyclopedia, is, also, significant, for, its, inclusion, of, al, zahrawi, s, personal, experiences, as, a, surgeon, which, provided, important, case, studies, for, aspiring, surgeons, this, distinguishes, it, from, other, strictly, factual, medical, works, of, the, time, most, notably, ibn, sina, s, canon, of, medicine, other, important, medical, texts, include, al, baytar, s, comprehensive, book, on, simple, drugs, and, foodstuffs, an, encyclopedia, with, descriptions, of, the, medical, uses, of, over, 1400, plants, and, other, types, of, medicine, and, ibn, habib, s, book, of, the, medicine, of, the, arabs, kitab, tibb, al, arab, a, historical, summary, of, arabic, medicine, until, the, 9th, century, ibn, habib, s, work, is, significant, because, it, is, one, of, the, oldest, known, writings, in, the, field, of, prophetic, medicine, which, uses, hadiths, to, create, islamic, based, medicinal, guidelines, his, book, is, also, significant, because, it, uses, principles, of, galenic, medicine, such, as, humorism, and, the, theory, of, four, temperaments, as, the, basis, of, its, medical, recommendations, the, ibn, zuhr, family, played, a, very, important, role, in, the, production, of, andalusi, medical, knowledge, as, they, produced, five, generations, of, medical, experts, particularly, in, the, fields, of, dietary, sciences, and, medicaments, abu, marwan, ibn, zuhr, d, 1162, is, particularly, notable, as, he, wrote, the, book, of, moderation, kitab, al, iqtisad, a, treatise, on, general, therapy, the, book, of, foods, kitab, al, aghdhiya, a, manual, on, foods, and, regimen, which, contains, guidelines, for, a, healthy, life, and, the, kitab, al, taysir, a, book, written, to, act, as, a, compendium, to, ibn, rushd, s, colliget, in, kitab, al, taysir, he, provides, one, of, the, earliest, clinical, descriptions, of, the, scabies, mite, three, of, the, most, notable, andalusi, astronomers, were, ibn, tufail, d, 1185, ibn, rushd, averroes, d, 1198, and, nur, ad, din, al, bitruji, alpetragius, d, 1204, all, lived, around, the, same, time, and, focused, their, astronomical, works, on, critiquing, and, revising, ptolemaic, astronomy, and, the, problem, of, the, equant, in, his, astronomical, model, instead, they, accepted, aristotle, s, model, and, promoted, the, theory, of, homocentric, spheres, al, bitruji, is, believed, to, have, studied, under, ibn, tufail, and, bitruji, s, book, on, cosmology, kitab, fi, al, hay, a, built, on, ibn, tufail, s, work, as, well, as, that, of, ibn, rushd, ibn, bajja, and, maimonides, the, book, s, goal, was, to, overcome, the, physical, difficulties, inherent, in, the, geometrical, models, of, ptolemy, s, almagest, and, to, describe, the, cosmos, in, agreement, with, aristotelian, or, neoplatonic, physics, which, it, succeeded, in, doing, to, an, extent, bitruji, s, book, set, a, precedent, of, criticizing, the, almagest, in, future, works, in, the, field, of, astronomy, although, ibn, rushd, originally, trained, and, practiced, as, a, jurist, he, was, exposed, to, astronomy, possibly, through, ibn, tufail, and, became, a, renowned, scientist, in, the, field, his, most, popular, work, was, his, summary, of, the, almagest, but, he, also, published, shorter, works, discussing, aristotle, s, planetary, theories, ibn, rushd, published, writings, on, philosophy, theology, and, medicine, throughout, his, life, too, including, commentaries, on, the, works, of, ibn, sina, in, addition, to, writing, the, important, book, of, the, medicine, of, the, arabs, ibn, habib, also, wrote, the, book, on, stars, kirab, fi, l, nujim, this, book, included, important, teachings, on, the, lunar, mansions, the, signs, of, the, zodiac, the, division, of, the, seasons, in, these, teachings, ibn, habib, calculated, the, phases, of, the, moon, and, dates, of, the, annual, solstices, and, equinoxes, with, relative, accuracy, another, important, astronomer, from, al, andalus, was, maslama, al, majriti, d, 1007, who, played, a, role, in, translating, and, writing, about, ptolemy, s, planisphaerium, and, almagest, he, built, on, the, work, of, older, astronomers, like, muhammad, ibn, musa, al, khwarizmi, whose, astronomical, tables, he, wrote, a, discussion, on, and, subsequently, improved, abu, ishaq, ibrahim, al, zarqali, d, 1087, had, many, influential, astronomical, successes, as, shown, by, copernicus, s, recognition, of, him, in, his, on, the, revolutions, of, the, heavenly, spheres, five, centuries, later, along, with, other, astronomers, he, undertook, extensive, work, to, edit, the, toledan, zij, astronomical, tables, he, also, accurately, calculated, the, motion, of, the, solar, apogee, to, be, 12, 04, seconds, per, year, which, is, relatively, close, to, today, s, calculation, of, 11, 8, seconds, per, year, other, important, scientific, advances, in, al, andalus, occurred, in, the, field, of, agronomy, these, advances, were, in, part, facilitated, by, technological, innovations, in, irrigation, systems, state, organized, large, scale, irrigation, projects, provided, water, to, city, baths, mosques, gardens, residential, homes, and, governing, palaces, such, as, the, al, hambra, and, its, gardens, in, granada, collective, peasant, built, irrigation, infrastructure, also, played, an, important, role, especially, in, agriculture, many, of, these, irrigation, techniques, especially, those, utilized, by, peasants, were, brought, to, al, andalus, by, migrating, berber, and, arab, tribes, although, some, irrigation, projects, built, on, existing, roman, infrastructure, most, of, al, andalus, s, irrigation, systems, were, new, projects, built, separate, from, old, roman, aqueducts, however, there, is, some, debate, about, this, among, scholars, one, notable, agriculturalist, was, ibn, al, awwam, who, wrote, the, book, of, agriculture, this, book, contains, 34, chapters, about, various, aspects, of, agriculture, and, animal, husbandry, including, discussions, of, over, 580, different, types, of, plants, and, how, to, treat, plant, diseases, other, agronomic, innovations, in, al, andalus, include, the, cultivation, of, the, pomegranate, from, syria, which, has, since, become, the, namesake, and, ubiquitous, symbol, of, the, city, of, granada, as, well, as, the, first, attempt, to, create, a, botanical, garden, near, c, rdoba, by, abd, al, rahman, i, religion, in, al, andalus, in, the, 11th, century, the, society, of, al, andalus, was, made, up, of, three, main, religious, groups, muslims, christians, and, jews, the, muslims, although, united, on, the, religious, level, had, several, ethnic, divisions, the, main, being, the, distinction, between, the, arabs, and, the, berbers, the, arab, elite, regarded, non, arab, muslims, as, second, class, citizens, and, they, were, particularly, scornful, of, the, berbers, the, ethnic, structure, of, al, andalus, consisted, of, arabs, at, the, top, of, the, social, scale, followed, by, in, descending, order, berbers, muladies, mozarabes, and, jews, each, of, these, communities, inhabited, distinct, neighborhoods, in, the, cities, in, the, 10th, century, a, massive, conversion, of, christians, took, place, and, muladies, muslims, of, native, iberian, origin, formed, the, majority, of, muslims, the, muwalladun, had, spoken, in, the, local, romance, dialects, of, latin, collectively, called, andalusi, romance, or, mozarabic, while, increasingly, adopting, the, arabic, language, which, eventually, evolved, into, the, andalusi, arabic, in, which, muslims, jews, and, christians, became, monolingual, in, the, last, surviving, muslim, state, in, the, iberian, peninsula, the, emirate, of, granada, 1230, 1492, eventually, the, muladies, and, later, the, berber, tribes, adopted, an, arabic, identity, like, the, majority, of, subject, people, in, egypt, the, levant, mesopotamia, and, north, africa, muladies, together, with, other, muslims, comprised, eighty, per, cent, of, the, population, of, al, andalus, by, 1100, mozarabs, were, christians, who, had, long, lived, under, muslim, and, arab, rule, adopting, many, arab, customs, art, and, architecture, and, words, while, still, maintaining, their, christian, and, latin, rituals, and, their, own, romance, languages, the, jewish, population, worked, mainly, as, tax, collectors, in, trade, or, as, doctors, or, ambassadors, at, the, end, of, the, 15th, century, there, were, about, 50, 000, jews, in, granada, and, roughly, 100, 000, in, the, whole, of, islamic, iberia, non, muslims, were, given, the, status, of, ahl, al, dhimma, people, under, protection, with, adult, men, paying, a, jizya, tax, equal, to, one, dinar, per, year, with, exemptions, for, the, elderly, and, the, disabled, those, who, were, neither, christians, nor, jews, such, as, pagans, were, given, the, status, of, majus, the, treatment, of, non, muslims, in, the, caliphate, has, been, a, subject, of, considerable, debate, among, scholars, and, commentators, especially, those, interested, in, drawing, parallels, to, the, co, existence, of, muslims, and, non, muslims, in, the, modern, world, jews, constituted, more, than, five, per, cent, of, the, population, al, andalus, was, a, key, centre, of, jewish, life, during, the, early, middle, ages, produced, important, scholars, and, was, one, of, the, most, stable, and, wealthy, jewish, communities, the, longest, period, of, relative, tolerance, began, after, 912, with, the, reign, of, abd, ar, rahman, iii, and, his, son, al, hakam, ii, and, the, jews, of, al, andalus, prospered, by, devoting, themselves, to, the, service, of, the, caliphate, of, c, rdoba, the, study, of, the, sciences, and, to, commerce, and, industry, especially, by, trading, in, silk, and, slaves, which, thus, promoted, the, prosperity, of, the, country, southern, iberia, became, an, asylum, for, the, oppressed, jews, of, other, countries, under, the, almoravids, and, the, almohads, there, may, have, been, intermittent, persecution, of, jews, but, sources, are, extremely, scarce, and, do, not, give, a, clear, picture, though, the, situation, appears, to, have, deteriorated, after, 1160, muslim, pogroms, against, jews, in, al, andalus, occurred, in, c, rdoba, 1011, and, in, granada, 1066, however, massacres, of, dhimmis, are, believed, to, be, rare, in, islamic, history, the, almohads, who, had, taken, control, of, the, almoravids, maghribi, and, andalusi, territories, by, 1147, far, surpassed, the, almoravides, in, fundamentalist, outlook, and, treated, the, non, muslims, harshly, faced, with, the, choice, of, either, death, or, conversion, many, jews, and, christians, emigrated, some, such, as, the, family, of, maimonides, fled, east, to, more, tolerant, muslim, lands, many, ethnicities, and, religions, co, existed, in, al, andalus, each, of, which, contributed, to, its, intellectual, prosperity, literacy, in, islamic, iberia, was, far, more, widespread, than, in, many, other, nations, in, the, west, of, the, time, in, the, 11th, century, the, hindu, arabic, numeral, system, base, 10, had, reached, europe, via, al, andalus, through, spanish, muslims, together, with, knowledge, of, astronomy, and, instruments, like, the, astrolabe, which, was, first, imported, by, gerbert, of, aurillac, for, that, reason, the, numerals, came, to, be, known, in, europe, as, arabic, numerals, despite, their, origins, in, india, from, the, earliest, days, the, umayyads, wanted, to, be, seen, as, intellectual, rivals, to, the, abbasids, and, for, c, rdoba, to, have, libraries, and, educational, institutions, to, that, of, their, rival, baghdad, although, there, was, a, clear, rivalry, between, the, two, powers, there, was, freedom, to, travel, between, the, two, caliphates, which, helped, spread, new, ideas, and, innovations, over, time, initially, most, of, the, population, spoke, romance, dialects, that, led, to, the, formation, of, iberian, romance, dialects, that, were, collectively, known, as, mozarabic, or, andalusi, romance, the, few, writings, in, those, dialects, that, have, been, found, use, an, arabic, script, and, seem, to, retain, many, archaic, features, of, vulgar, latin, they, are, usually, assumed, to, have, been, increasingly, subject, to, arabic, influence, however, as, the, use, of, arabic, by, muwallad, n, urban, christians, and, sephardi, jews, spread, in, the, south, and, mozarab, christians, were, linguistically, assimilated, by, the, christian, kingdoms, in, the, north, the, mozarabic, dialects, eventually, disappeared, because, of, that, assimilation, however, mozarabic, became, the, main, source, and, vehicle, of, transmission, of, arabic, loanwords, to, spanish, and, portuguese, classical, arabic, became, the, language, of, administration, and, of, literature, while, in, everyday, life, a, vernacular, andalusi, arabic, developped, the, latter, consisted, of, many, local, dialects, but, a, standard, koin, probably, emerged, by, the, 9th, or, 10th, century, arabic, spread, progressively, across, the, whole, population, through, a, process, of, arabization, which, became, an, important, component, of, andalusi, identity, by, the, end, of, the, 9th, century, arabic, was, widely, adopted, even, among, andalusi, christians, romance, vernaculars, mozarabic, ceased, to, be, spoken, in, the, 13th, century, on, the, one, hand, following, a, gradual, decline, initiated, in, the, 10th, century, in, al, andalus, and, on, the, other, hand, because, of, the, shrinking, of, the, muslim, ruled, lands, and, the, expansion, of, romance, varieties, from, further, north, according, to, isaak, moiseevich, fil, shtinski, in, the, 10th, century, a, favourable, influence, on, the, development, of, andalusi, literature, was, exerted, by, the, literary, circles, organised, by, rich, and, noble, cordovan, patrons, according, to, jaakko, h, meen, anttila, andalusian, literature, was, still, very, much, dominated, by, the, eastern, tradition, around, the, year, 1000, and, the, arabs, of, spain, probably, felt, somewhat, isolated, arabic, andalusi, poetry, was, marked, by, the, rise, of, muwashshah, as, worded, by, james, t, monroe, ibn, quzman, also, raised, the, native, popular, and, colloquial, zajal, form, to, a, higher, literary, level, than, it, had, previously, enjoyed, in, his, homeland, although, his, work, found, greater, acceptance, in, baghdad, than, it, did, in, the, far, west, of, the, islamic, world, rith, al, andalus, is, considered, the, most, significant, of, a, series, of, poems, that, were, written, in, the, classical, tradition, of, rith, which, denotes, both, lamentation, and, a, literary, genre, in, itself, by, andalusi, poets, who, had, taken, inspiration, from, the, fall, of, andalusi, cities, and, territories, jewish, poetry, from, al, andalus, also, developed, mostly, but, not, exclusively, in, hebrew, with, significant, consonance, with, arabic, poetry, in, both, theme, and, form, one, specialist, of, al,
