fertile, crescent, europe, africa, siberia, the, paleolithic, or, palaeolithic, p, e, l, i, o, l, k, p, l, i, pay, lee, oh, lith, ik, pal, ee, also, called, the, old, stone, age, from, ancient, greek, palai, s, old, and, l, thos, stone, is, a, period, in, human, prehistory, that, is, distinguished, by, the, original, development, of, stone, tools, and, which, represents, almost, the, entire, period, of, human, prehistoric, technology, it, extends, from, the, earliest, known, use, of, stone, tools, by, hominins, c, 3, 3, million, years, ago, to, the, end, of, the, pleistocene, c, 11, 650, cal, bp, the, paleolithic, age, in, europe, preceded, the, mesolithic, age, although, the, date, of, the, transition, varies, geographically, by, several, thousand, years, during, the, paleolithic, age, hominins, grouped, together, in, small, societies, such, as, bands, and, subsisted, by, gathering, plants, fishing, and, hunting, or, scavenging, wild, animals, the, paleolithic, age, is, characterized, by, the, use, of, knapped, stone, tools, although, at, the, time, humans, also, used, wood, and, bone, tools, other, organic, commodities, were, adapted, for, use, as, tools, including, leather, and, vegetable, fibers, however, due, to, rapid, decomposition, these, have, not, survived, to, any, great, degree, about, 50, 000, years, ago, a, marked, increase, in, the, diversity, of, artifacts, occurred, in, africa, bone, artifacts, and, the, first, art, appear, in, the, archaeological, record, the, first, evidence, of, human, fishing, is, also, noted, from, artifacts, in, places, such, as, blombos, cave, in, south, africa, archaeologists, classify, artifacts, of, the, last, 50, 000, years, into, many, different, categories, such, as, projectile, points, engraving, tools, sharp, knife, blades, and, drilling, and, piercing, tools, humankind, gradually, evolved, from, early, members, of, the, genus, homo, such, as, homo, habilis, who, used, simple, stone, tools, into, anatomically, modern, humans, as, well, as, behaviourally, modern, humans, by, the, upper, paleolithic, during, the, end, of, the, paleolithic, age, specifically, the, middle, or, upper, paleolithic, age, humans, began, to, produce, the, earliest, works, of, art, and, to, engage, in, religious, or, spiritual, behavior, such, as, burial, and, ritual, conditions, during, the, paleolithic, age, went, through, a, set, of, glacial, and, interglacial, periods, in, which, the, climate, periodically, fluctuated, between, warm, and, cool, temperatures, by, c, 50, 000, c, 40, 000, bp, the, first, humans, set, foot, in, australia, by, c, 45, 000, bp, humans, lived, at, 61, n, latitude, in, europe, by, c, 30, 000, bp, japan, was, reached, and, by, c, 27, 000, bp, humans, were, present, in, siberia, above, the, arctic, circle, by, the, end, of, the, upper, paleolithic, age, humans, had, crossed, beringia, and, expanded, throughout, the, americas, continents, the, term, palaeolithic, was, coined, by, archaeologist, john, lubbock, in, 1865, it, derives, from, greek, palaios, old, and, lithos, stone, meaning, old, age, of, the, stone, or, old, stone, age, the, paleolithic, overlaps, with, the, pleistocene, epoch, of, geologic, time, both, ended, 12, 000, years, ago, although, the, pleistocene, started, 2, 6, million, years, ago, 700, 000, years, after, the, paleolithic, s, start, this, epoch, experienced, important, geographic, and, climatic, changes, that, affected, human, societies, during, the, preceding, pliocene, continents, had, continued, to, drift, from, possibly, as, far, as, 250, km, 160, mi, from, their, present, locations, to, positions, only, 70, km, 43, mi, from, their, current, location, south, america, became, linked, to, north, america, through, the, isthmus, of, panama, bringing, a, nearly, complete, end, to, south, america, s, distinctive, marsupial, fauna, the, formation, of, the, isthmus, had, major, consequences, on, global, temperatures, because, warm, equatorial, ocean, currents, were, cut, off, and, the, cold, arctic, and, antarctic, waters, lowered, temperatures, in, the, now, isolated, atlantic, ocean, most, of, central, america, formed, during, the, pliocene, to, connect, the, continents, of, north, and, south, america, allowing, fauna, from, these, continents, to, leave, their, native, habitats, and, colonize, new, areas, africa, s, collision, with, asia, created, the, mediterranean, cutting, off, the, remnants, of, the, tethys, ocean, during, the, pleistocene, the, continents, were, essentially, at, their, modern, positions, the, tectonic, plates, on, which, they, sit, have, probably, moved, at, most, 100, km, 62, mi, from, each, other, since, the, beginning, of, the, period, climates, during, the, pliocene, became, cooler, and, drier, and, seasonal, similar, to, modern, climates, ice, sheets, grew, on, antarctica, the, formation, of, an, arctic, ice, cap, around, 3, million, years, ago, is, signaled, by, an, abrupt, shift, in, oxygen, isotope, ratios, and, ice, rafted, cobbles, in, the, north, atlantic, and, north, pacific, ocean, beds, mid, latitude, glaciation, probably, began, before, the, end, of, the, epoch, the, global, cooling, that, occurred, during, the, pliocene, may, have, spurred, on, the, disappearance, of, forests, and, the, spread, of, grasslands, and, savannas, the, pleistocene, climate, was, characterized, by, repeated, glacial, cycles, during, which, continental, glaciers, pushed, to, the, 40th, parallel, in, some, places, four, major, glacial, events, have, been, identified, as, well, as, many, minor, intervening, events, a, major, event, is, a, general, glacial, excursion, termed, a, glacial, glacials, are, separated, by, interglacials, during, a, glacial, the, glacier, experiences, minor, advances, and, retreats, the, minor, excursion, is, a, stadial, times, between, stadials, are, interstadials, each, glacial, advance, tied, up, huge, volumes, of, water, in, continental, ice, sheets, 1, 500, 3, 000, m, 4, 900, 9, 800, ft, deep, resulting, in, temporary, sea, level, drops, of, 100, m, 330, ft, or, more, over, the, entire, surface, of, the, earth, during, interglacial, times, drowned, coastlines, were, common, mitigated, by, isostatic, or, other, emergent, motion, of, some, regions, the, effects, of, glaciation, were, global, antarctica, was, ice, bound, throughout, the, pleistocene, and, the, preceding, pliocene, the, andes, were, covered, in, the, south, by, the, patagonian, ice, cap, there, were, glaciers, in, new, zealand, and, tasmania, the, decaying, glaciers, of, mount, kenya, mount, kilimanjaro, and, the, ruwenzori, range, in, east, and, central, africa, were, larger, glaciers, existed, in, the, mountains, of, ethiopia, and, to, the, west, in, the, atlas, mountains, in, the, northern, hemisphere, many, glaciers, fused, into, one, the, cordilleran, ice, sheet, covered, the, north, american, northwest, the, laurentide, covered, the, east, the, fenno, scandian, ice, sheet, covered, northern, europe, including, great, britain, the, alpine, ice, sheet, covered, the, alps, scattered, domes, stretched, across, siberia, and, the, arctic, shelf, the, northern, seas, were, frozen, during, the, late, upper, paleolithic, latest, pleistocene, c, 18, 000, bp, the, beringia, land, bridge, between, asia, and, north, america, was, blocked, by, ice, which, may, have, prevented, early, paleo, indians, such, as, the, clovis, culture, from, directly, crossing, beringia, to, reach, the, americas, according, to, mark, lynas, through, collected, data, the, pleistocene, s, overall, climate, could, be, characterized, as, a, continuous, el, ni, o, with, trade, winds, in, the, south, pacific, weakening, or, heading, east, warm, air, rising, near, peru, warm, water, spreading, from, the, west, pacific, and, the, indian, ocean, to, the, east, pacific, and, other, el, ni, o, markers, the, paleolithic, is, often, held, to, finish, at, the, end, of, the, ice, age, the, end, of, the, pleistocene, epoch, and, earth, s, climate, became, warmer, this, may, have, caused, or, contributed, to, the, extinction, of, the, pleistocene, megafauna, although, it, is, also, possible, that, the, late, pleistocene, extinctions, were, at, least, in, part, caused, by, other, factors, such, as, disease, and, overhunting, by, humans, new, research, suggests, that, the, extinction, of, the, woolly, mammoth, may, have, been, caused, by, the, combined, effect, of, climatic, change, and, human, hunting, scientists, suggest, that, climate, change, during, the, end, of, the, pleistocene, caused, the, mammoths, habitat, to, shrink, resulting, in, a, drop, in, population, the, small, populations, were, then, hunted, out, by, paleolithic, humans, the, global, warming, that, occurred, during, the, end, of, the, pleistocene, and, the, beginning, of, the, holocene, may, have, made, it, easier, for, humans, to, reach, mammoth, habitats, that, were, previously, frozen, and, inaccessible, small, populations, of, woolly, mammoths, survived, on, isolated, arctic, islands, saint, paul, island, and, wrangel, island, until, c, 3700, bp, and, c, 1700, bp, respectively, the, wrangel, island, population, became, extinct, around, the, same, time, the, island, was, settled, by, prehistoric, humans, there, is, no, evidence, of, prehistoric, human, presence, on, saint, paul, island, though, early, human, settlements, dating, as, far, back, as, 6500, bp, were, found, on, the, nearby, aleutian, islands, nearly, all, of, our, knowledge, of, paleolithic, people, and, way, of, life, comes, from, archaeology, and, ethnographic, comparisons, to, modern, hunter, gatherer, cultures, such, as, the, kung, san, who, live, similarly, to, their, paleolithic, predecessors, the, economy, of, a, typical, paleolithic, society, was, a, hunter, gatherer, economy, humans, hunted, wild, animals, for, meat, and, gathered, food, firewood, and, materials, for, their, tools, clothes, or, shelters, the, population, density, was, very, low, around, only, 0, 4, inhabitants, per, square, kilometre, 1, sq, mi, this, was, most, likely, due, to, low, body, fat, infanticide, high, levels, of, physical, activity, among, women, late, weaning, of, infants, and, a, nomadic, lifestyle, in, addition, even, a, large, area, of, land, could, not, support, many, people, without, being, actively, farmed, food, was, difficult, to, come, by, and, so, groups, were, prevented, from, growing, too, large, by, the, amount, of, food, they, could, gather, like, contemporary, hunter, gatherers, paleolithic, humans, enjoyed, an, abundance, of, leisure, time, unparalleled, in, both, neolithic, farming, societies, and, modern, industrial, societies, at, the, end, of, the, paleolithic, specifically, the, middle, or, upper, paleolithic, people, began, to, produce, works, of, art, such, as, cave, paintings, rock, art, and, jewellery, and, began, to, engage, in, religious, behavior, such, as, burials, and, rituals, at, the, beginning, of, the, paleolithic, hominins, were, found, primarily, in, eastern, africa, east, of, the, great, rift, valley, most, known, hominin, fossils, dating, earlier, than, one, million, years, before, present, are, found, in, this, area, particularly, in, kenya, tanzania, and, ethiopia, by, c, 2, 000, 000, c, 1, 500, 000, bp, groups, of, hominins, began, leaving, africa, settling, southern, europe, and, asia, the, south, caucasus, was, occupied, by, c, 1, 700, 000, bp, and, northern, china, was, reached, by, c, 1, 660, 000, bp, by, the, end, of, the, lower, paleolithic, members, of, the, hominin, family, were, living, in, what, is, now, china, western, indonesia, and, in, europe, around, the, mediterranean, and, as, far, north, as, england, france, southern, germany, and, bulgaria, their, further, northward, expansion, may, have, been, limited, by, the, lack, of, control, of, fire, studies, of, cave, settlements, in, europe, indicate, no, regular, use, of, fire, prior, to, c, 400, 000, c, 300, 000, bp, east, asian, fossils, from, this, period, are, typically, placed, in, the, genus, homo, erectus, very, little, fossil, evidence, is, available, at, known, lower, paleolithic, sites, in, europe, but, it, is, believed, that, hominins, who, inhabited, these, sites, were, likewise, homo, erectus, there, is, no, evidence, of, hominins, in, america, australia, or, almost, anywhere, in, oceania, during, this, time, period, fates, of, these, early, colonists, and, their, relationships, to, modern, humans, are, still, subject, to, debate, according, to, current, archaeological, and, genetic, models, there, were, at, least, two, notable, expansion, events, subsequent, to, peopling, of, eurasia, c, 2, 000, 000, c, 1, 500, 000, bp, around, 500, 000, bp, a, group, of, early, humans, frequently, called, homo, heidelbergensis, came, to, europe, from, africa, and, eventually, evolved, into, homo, neanderthalensis, neanderthals, in, the, middle, paleolithic, neanderthals, were, present, in, the, region, now, occupied, by, poland, both, homo, erectus, and, homo, neanderthalensis, became, extinct, by, the, start, of, the, upper, paleolithic, descended, from, homo, sapiens, the, anatomically, modern, homo, sapiens, sapiens, emerged, in, eastern, africa, c, 300, 000, bp, left, africa, around, 50, 000, bp, and, expanded, throughout, the, planet, multiple, hominid, groups, coexisted, for, some, time, in, certain, locations, homo, neanderthalensis, were, still, found, in, parts, of, eurasia, c, 40, 000, bp, years, and, engaged, in, an, unknown, degree, of, interbreeding, with, homo, sapiens, sapiens, dna, studies, also, suggest, an, unknown, degree, of, interbreeding, between, homo, sapiens, sapiens, and, homo, sapiens, denisova, hominin, fossils, not, belonging, either, to, homo, neanderthalensis, or, to, homo, sapiens, species, found, in, the, altai, mountains, and, indonesia, were, radiocarbon, dated, to, c, 30, 000, c, 40, 000, bp, and, c, 17, 000, bp, respectively, for, the, duration, of, the, paleolithic, human, populations, remained, low, especially, outside, the, equatorial, region, the, entire, population, of, europe, between, 16, 000, and, 11, 000, bp, likely, averaged, some, 30, 000, individuals, and, between, 40, 000, and, 16, 000, bp, it, was, even, lower, at, 4, 000, 6, 000, individuals, however, remains, of, thousands, of, butchered, animals, and, tools, made, by, palaeolithic, humans, were, found, in, lapa, do, picareiro, a, cave, in, portugal, dating, back, between, 41, 000, and, 38, 000, years, ago, some, researchers, have, noted, that, science, limited, in, that, age, to, some, early, ideas, about, astronomy, or, cosmology, had, limited, impact, on, paleolithic, technology, making, fire, was, widespread, knowledge, and, it, was, possible, without, an, understanding, of, chemical, processes, these, types, of, practical, skills, are, sometimes, called, crafts, religion, superstitution, or, appeals, to, the, supernatural, may, have, played, a, part, in, the, cultural, explanations, of, phenomena, like, combustion, paleolithic, humans, made, tools, of, stone, bone, primarily, deer, and, wood, the, early, paleolithic, hominins, australopithecus, were, the, first, users, of, stone, tools, excavations, in, gona, ethiopia, have, produced, thousands, of, artifacts, and, through, radioisotopic, dating, and, magnetostratigraphy, the, sites, can, be, firmly, dated, to, 2, 6, million, years, ago, evidence, shows, these, early, hominins, intentionally, selected, raw, stone, with, good, flaking, qualities, and, chose, appropriate, sized, stones, for, their, needs, to, produce, sharp, edged, tools, for, cutting, the, earliest, paleolithic, stone, tool, industry, the, oldowan, began, around, 2, 6, million, years, ago, it, produced, tools, such, as, choppers, burins, and, stitching, awls, it, was, completely, replaced, around, 250, 000, years, ago, by, the, more, complex, acheulean, industry, which, was, first, conceived, by, homo, ergaster, around, 1, 8, 1, 65, million, years, ago, the, acheulean, implements, completely, vanish, from, the, archaeological, record, around, 100, 000, years, ago, and, were, replaced, by, more, complex, middle, paleolithic, tool, kits, such, as, the, mousterian, and, the, aterian, industries, lower, paleolithic, humans, used, a, variety, of, stone, tools, including, hand, axes, and, choppers, although, they, appear, to, have, used, hand, axes, often, there, is, disagreement, about, their, use, interpretations, range, from, cutting, and, chopping, tools, to, digging, implements, to, flaking, cores, to, the, use, in, traps, and, as, a, purely, ritual, significance, perhaps, in, courting, behavior, william, h, calvin, has, suggested, that, some, hand, axes, could, have, served, as, killer, frisbees, meant, to, be, thrown, at, a, herd, of, animals, at, a, waterhole, so, as, to, stun, one, of, them, there, are, no, indications, of, hafting, and, some, artifacts, are, far, too, large, for, that, thus, a, thrown, hand, axe, would, not, usually, have, penetrated, deeply, enough, to, cause, very, serious, injuries, nevertheless, it, could, have, been, an, effective, weapon, for, defense, against, predators, choppers, and, scrapers, were, likely, used, for, skinning, and, butchering, scavenged, animals, and, sharp, ended, sticks, were, often, obtained, for, digging, up, edible, roots, presumably, early, humans, used, wooden, spears, as, early, as, 5, million, years, ago, to, hunt, small, animals, much, as, their, relatives, chimpanzees, have, been, observed, to, do, in, senegal, africa, lower, paleolithic, humans, constructed, shelters, such, as, the, possible, wood, hut, at, terra, amata, fire, was, used, by, the, lower, paleolithic, hominins, homo, erectus, and, homo, ergaster, as, early, as, 300, 000, to, 1, 5, million, years, ago, and, possibly, even, earlier, by, the, early, lower, paleolithic, oldowan, hominin, homo, habilis, or, by, robust, australopithecines, such, as, paranthropus, however, the, use, of, fire, only, became, common, in, the, societies, of, the, following, middle, stone, age, and, middle, paleolithic, use, of, fire, reduced, mortality, rates, and, provided, protection, against, predators, early, hominins, may, have, begun, to, cook, their, food, as, early, as, the, lower, paleolithic, c, 1, 9, million, years, ago, or, at, the, latest, in, the, early, middle, paleolithic, c, 250, 000, years, ago, some, scientists, have, hypothesized, that, hominins, began, cooking, food, to, defrost, frozen, meat, which, would, help, ensure, their, survival, in, cold, regions, archaeologists, cite, morphological, shifts, in, cranial, anatomy, as, evidence, for, emergence, of, cooking, and, food, processing, technologies, these, morphological, changes, include, decreases, in, molar, and, jaw, size, thinner, tooth, enamel, and, decrease, in, gut, volume, during, much, of, the, pleistocene, epoch, our, ancestors, relied, on, simple, food, processing, techniques, such, as, roasting, the, upper, palaeolithic, saw, the, emergence, of, boiling, an, advance, in, food, processing, technology, which, rendered, plant, foods, more, digestible, decreased, their, toxicity, and, maximised, their, nutritional, value, thermally, altered, rock, heated, stones, are, easily, identifiable, in, the, archaeological, record, stone, boiling, and, pit, baking, were, common, techniques, which, involved, heating, large, pebbles, then, transferring, the, hot, stones, into, a, perishable, container, to, heat, the, water, this, technology, is, typified, in, the, middle, palaeolithic, example, of, the, abri, pataud, hearths, the, lower, paleolithic, homo, erectus, possibly, invented, rafts, c, 840, 000, c, 800, 000, bp, to, travel, over, large, bodies, of, water, which, may, have, allowed, a, group, of, homo, erectus, to, reach, the, island, of, flores, and, evolve, into, the, small, hominin, homo, floresiensis, however, this, hypothesis, is, disputed, within, the, anthropological, community, the, possible, use, of, rafts, during, the, lower, paleolithic, may, indicate, that, lower, paleolithic, hominins, such, as, homo, erectus, were, more, advanced, than, previously, believed, and, may, have, even, spoken, an, early, form, of, modern, language, supplementary, evidence, from, neanderthal, and, modern, human, sites, located, around, the, mediterranean, sea, such, as, coa, de, sa, multa, c, 300, 000, bp, has, also, indicated, that, both, middle, and, upper, paleolithic, humans, used, rafts, to, travel, over, large, bodies, of, water, i, e, the, mediterranean, sea, for, the, purpose, of, colonizing, other, bodies, of, land, by, around, 200, 000, bp, middle, paleolithic, stone, tool, manufacturing, spawned, a, tool, making, technique, known, as, the, prepared, core, technique, that, was, more, elaborate, than, previous, acheulean, techniques, this, technique, increased, efficiency, by, allowing, the, creation, of, more, controlled, and, consistent, flakes, it, allowed, middle, paleolithic, humans, to, create, stone, tipped, spears, which, were, the, earliest, composite, tools, by, hafting, sharp, pointy, stone, flakes, onto, wooden, shafts, in, addition, to, improving, tool, making, methods, the, middle, paleolithic, also, saw, an, improvement, of, the, tools, themselves, that, allowed, access, to, a, wider, variety, and, amount, of, food, sources, for, example, microliths, or, small, stone, tools, or, points, were, invented, around, 70, 000, 65, 000, bp, and, were, essential, to, the, invention, of, bows, and, atlatls, spear, throwers, in, the, following, upper, paleolithic, harpoons, were, invented, and, used, for, the, first, time, during, the, late, middle, paleolithic, c, 90, 000, bp, the, invention, of, these, devices, brought, fish, into, the, human, diets, which, provided, a, hedge, against, starvation, and, a, more, abundant, food, supply, thanks, to, their, technology, and, their, advanced, social, structures, paleolithic, groups, such, as, the, neanderthals, who, had, a, middle, paleolithic, level, of, technology, appear, to, have, hunted, large, game, just, as, well, as, upper, paleolithic, modern, humans, and, the, neanderthals, in, particular, may, have, likewise, hunted, with, projectile, weapons, nonetheless, neanderthal, use, of, projectile, weapons, in, hunting, occurred, very, rarely, or, perhaps, never, and, the, neanderthals, hunted, large, game, animals, mostly, by, ambushing, them, and, attacking, them, with, m, l, e, weapons, such, as, thrusting, spears, rather, than, attacking, them, from, a, distance, with, projectile, weapons, during, the, upper, paleolithic, further, inventions, were, made, such, as, the, net, c, 22, 000, or, c, 29, 000, bp, bolas, the, spear, thrower, c, 30, 000, bp, the, bow, and, arrow, c, 25, 000, or, c, 30, 000, bp, and, the, oldest, example, of, ceramic, art, the, venus, of, doln, v, stonice, c, 29, 000, c, 25, 000, bp, kilu, cave, at, buku, island, solomon, islands, demonstrates, navigation, of, some, 60, km, of, open, ocean, at, 30, 000, bccal, early, dogs, were, domesticated, sometime, between, 30, 000, and, 14, 000, bp, presumably, to, aid, in, hunting, however, the, earliest, instances, of, successful, domestication, of, dogs, may, be, much, more, ancient, than, this, evidence, from, canine, dna, collected, by, robert, k, wayne, suggests, that, dogs, may, have, been, first, domesticated, in, the, late, middle, paleolithic, around, 100, 000, bp, or, perhaps, even, earlier, archaeological, evidence, from, the, dordogne, region, of, france, demonstrates, that, members, of, the, european, early, upper, paleolithic, culture, known, as, the, aurignacian, used, calendars, c, 30, 000, bp, this, was, a, lunar, calendar, that, was, used, to, document, the, phases, of, the, moon, genuine, solar, calendars, did, not, appear, until, the, neolithic, upper, paleolithic, cultures, were, probably, able, to, time, the, migration, of, game, animals, such, as, wild, horses, and, deer, this, ability, allowed, humans, to, become, efficient, hunters, and, to, exploit, a, wide, variety, of, game, animals, recent, research, indicates, that, the, neanderthals, timed, their, hunts, and, the, migrations, of, game, animals, long, before, the, beginning, of, the, upper, paleolithic, the, social, organization, of, the, earliest, paleolithic, lower, paleolithic, societies, remains, largely, unknown, to, scientists, though, lower, paleolithic, hominins, such, as, homo, habilis, and, homo, erectus, are, likely, to, have, had, more, complex, social, structures, than, chimpanzee, societies, late, oldowan, early, acheulean, humans, such, as, homo, ergaster, homo, erectus, may, have, been, the, first, people, to, invent, central, campsites, or, home, bases, and, incorporate, them, into, their, foraging, and, hunting, strategies, like, contemporary, hunter, gatherers, possibly, as, early, as, 1, 7, million, years, ago, however, the, earliest, solid, evidence, for, the, existence, of, home, bases, or, central, campsites, hearths, and, shelters, among, humans, only, dates, back, to, 500, 000, years, ago, similarly, scientists, disagree, whether, lower, paleolithic, humans, were, largely, monogamous, or, polygynous, in, particular, the, provisional, model, suggests, that, bipedalism, arose, in, pre, paleolithic, australopithecine, societies, as, an, adaptation, to, monogamous, lifestyles, however, other, researchers, note, that, sexual, dimorphism, is, more, pronounced, in, lower, paleolithic, humans, such, as, homo, erectus, than, in, modern, humans, who, are, less, polygynous, than, other, primates, which, suggests, that, lower, paleolithic, humans, had, a, largely, polygynous, lifestyle, because, species, that, have, the, most, pronounced, sexual, dimorphism, tend, more, likely, to, be, polygynous, human, societies, from, the, paleolithic, to, the, early, neolithic, farming, tribes, lived, without, states, and, organized, governments, for, most, of, the, lower, paleolithic, human, societies, were, possibly, more, hierarchical, than, their, middle, and, upper, paleolithic, descendants, and, probably, were, not, grouped, into, bands, though, during, the, end, of, the, lower, paleolithic, the, latest, populations, of, the, hominin, homo, erectus, may, have, begun, living, in, small, scale, possibly, egalitarian, bands, similar, to, both, middle, and, upper, paleolithic, societies, and, modern, hunter, gatherers, middle, paleolithic, societies, unlike, lower, paleolithic, and, early, neolithic, ones, consisted, of, bands, that, ranged, from, 20, 30, or, 25, 100, members, and, were, usually, nomadic, these, bands, were, formed, by, several, families, bands, sometimes, joined, together, into, larger, macrobands, for, activities, such, as, acquiring, mates, and, celebrations, or, where, resources, were, abundant, by, the, end, of, the, paleolithic, era, c, 10, 000, bp, people, began, to, settle, down, into, permanent, locations, and, began, to, rely, on, agriculture, for, sustenance, in, many, locations, much, evidence, exists, that, humans, took, part, in, long, distance, trade, between, bands, for, rare, commodities, such, as, ochre, which, was, often, used, for, religious, purposes, such, as, ritual, and, raw, materials, as, early, as, 120, 000, years, ago, in, middle, paleolithic, inter, band, trade, may, have, appeared, during, the, middle, paleolithic, because, trade, between, bands, would, have, helped, ensure, their, survival, by, allowing, them, to, exchange, resources, and, commodities, such, as, raw, materials, during, times, of, relative, scarcity, i, e, famine, drought, like, in, modern, hunter, gatherer, societies, individuals, in, paleolithic, societies, may, have, been, subordinate, to, the, band, as, a, whole, both, neanderthals, and, modern, humans, took, care, of, the, elderly, members, of, their, societies, during, the, middle, and, upper, paleolithic, some, sources, claim, that, most, middle, and, upper, paleolithic, societies, were, possibly, fundamentally, egalitarian, and, may, have, rarely, or, never, engaged, in, organized, violence, between, groups, i, e, war, some, upper, paleolithic, societies, in, resource, rich, environments, such, as, societies, in, sungir, in, what, is, now, russia, may, have, had, more, complex, and, hierarchical, organization, such, as, tribes, with, a, pronounced, hierarchy, and, a, somewhat, formal, division, of, labor, and, may, have, engaged, in, endemic, warfare, some, argue, that, there, was, no, formal, leadership, during, the, middle, and, upper, paleolithic, like, contemporary, egalitarian, hunter, gatherers, such, as, the, mbuti, pygmies, societies, may, have, made, decisions, by, communal, consensus, decision, making, rather, than, by, appointing, permanent, rulers, such, as, chiefs, and, monarchs, nor, was, there, a, formal, division, of, labor, during, the, paleolithic, each, member, of, the, group, was, skilled, at, all, tasks, essential, to, survival, regardless, of, individual, abilities, theories, to, explain, the, apparent, egalitarianism, have, arisen, notably, the, marxist, concept, of, primitive, communism, christopher, boehm, 1999, has, hypothesized, that, egalitarianism, may, have, evolved, in, paleolithic, societies, because, of, a, need, to, distribute, resources, such, as, food, and, meat, equally, to, avoid, famine, and, ensure, a, stable, food, supply, raymond, c, kelly, speculates, that, the, relative, peacefulness, of, middle, and, upper, paleolithic, societies, resulted, from, a, low, population, density, cooperative, relationships, between, groups, such, as, reciprocal, exchange, of, commodities, and, collaboration, on, hunting, expeditions, and, because, the, invention, of, projectile, weapons, such, as, throwing, spears, provided, less, incentive, for, war, because, they, increased, the, damage, done, to, the, attacker, and, decreased, the, relative, amount, of, territory, attackers, could, gain, however, other, sources, claim, that, most, paleolithic, groups, may, have, been, larger, more, complex, sedentary, and, warlike, than, most, contemporary, hunter, gatherer, societies, due, to, occupying, more, resource, abundant, areas, than, most, modern, hunter, gatherers, who, have, been, pushed, into, more, marginal, habitats, by, agricultural, societies, anthropologists, have, typically, assumed, that, in, paleolithic, societies, women, were, responsible, for, gathering, wild, plants, and, firewood, and, men, were, responsible, for, hunting, and, scavenging, dead, animals, however, analogies, to, existent, hunter, gatherer, societies, such, as, the, hadza, people, and, the, aboriginal, australians, suggest, that, the, sexual, division, of, labor, in, the, paleolithic, was, relatively, flexible, men, may, have, participated, in, gathering, plants, firewood, and, insects, and, women, may, have, procured, small, game, animals, for, consumption, and, assisted, men, in, driving, herds, of, large, game, animals, such, as, woolly, mammoths, and, deer, off, cliffs, additionally, recent, research, by, anthropologist, and, archaeologist, steven, kuhn, from, the, university, of, arizona, is, argued, to, support, that, this, division, of, labor, did, not, exist, prior, to, the, upper, paleolithic, and, was, invented, relatively, recently, in, human, pre, history, sexual, division, of, labor, may, have, been, developed, to, allow, humans, to, acquire, food, and, other, resources, more, efficiently, possibly, there, was, approximate, parity, between, men, and, women, during, the, middle, and, upper, paleolithic, and, that, period, may, have, been, the, most, gender, equal, time, in, human, history, archaeological, evidence, from, art, and, funerary, rituals, indicates, that, a, number, of, individual, women, enjoyed, seemingly, high, status, in, their, communities, and, it, is, likely, that, both, sexes, participated, in, decision, making, the, earliest, known, paleolithic, shaman, c, 30, 000, bp, was, female, jared, diamond, suggests, that, the, status, of, women, declined, with, the, adoption, of, agriculture, because, women, in, farming, societies, typically, have, more, pregnancies, and, are, expected, to, do, more, demanding, work, than, women, in, hunter, gatherer, societies, like, most, modern, hunter, gatherer, societies, paleolithic, and, mesolithic, groups, probably, followed, a, largely, ambilineal, approach, at, the, same, time, depending, on, the, society, the, residence, could, be, virilocal, uxorilocal, and, sometimes, the, spouses, could, live, with, neither, the, husband, s, relatives, nor, the, wife, s, relatives, at, all, taken, together, most, likely, the, lifestyle, of, hunter, gatherers, can, be, characterized, as, multilocal, early, examples, of, artistic, expression, such, as, the, venus, of, tan, tan, and, the, patterns, found, on, elephant, bones, from, bilzingsleben, in, thuringia, may, have, been, produced, by, acheulean, tool, users, such, as, homo, erectus, prior, to, the, start, of, the, middle, paleolithic, period, however, the, earliest, undisputed, evidence, of, art, during, the, paleolithic, comes, from, middle, paleolithic, middle, stone, age, sites, such, as, blombos, cave, south, africa, in, the, form, of, bracelets, beads, rock, art, and, ochre, used, as, body, paint, and, perhaps, in, ritual, undisputed, evidence, of, art, only, becomes, common, in, the, upper, paleolithic, lower, paleolithic, acheulean, tool, users, according, to, robert, g, bednarik, began, to, engage, in, symbolic, behavior, such, as, art, around, 850, 000, bp, they, decorated, themselves, with, beads, and, collected, exotic, stones, for, aesthetic, rather, than, utilitarian, qualities, according, to, him, traces, of, the, pigment, ochre, from, late, lower, paleolithic, acheulean, archaeological, sites, suggests, that, acheulean, societies, like, later, upper, paleolithic, societies, collected, and, used, ochre, to, create, rock, art, nevertheless, it, is, also, possible, that, the, ochre, traces, found, at, lower, paleolithic, sites, is, naturally, occurring, upper, paleolithic, humans, produced, works, of, art, such, as, cave, paintings, venus, figurines, animal, carvings, and, rock, paintings, upper, paleolithic, art, can, be, divided, into, two, broad, categories, figurative, art, such, as, cave, paintings, that, clearly, depicts, animals, or, more, rarely, humans, and, nonfigurative, which, consists, of, shapes, and, symbols, cave, paintings, have, been, interpreted, in, a, number, of, ways, by, modern, archaeologists, the, earliest, explanation, by, the, prehistorian, abbe, breuil, interpreted, the, paintings, as, a, form, of, magic, designed, to, ensure, a, successful, hunt, however, this, hypothesis, fails, to, explain, the, existence, of, animals, such, as, saber, toothed, cats, and, lions, which, were, not, hunted, for, food, and, the, existence, of, half, human, half, animal, beings, in, cave, paintings, the, anthropologist, david, lewis, williams, has, suggested, that, paleolithic, cave, paintings, were, indications, of, shamanistic, practices, because, the, paintings, of, half, human, half, animal, figures, and, the, remoteness, of, the, caves, are, reminiscent, of, modern, hunter, gatherer, shamanistic, practices, symbol, like, images, are, more, common, in, paleolithic, cave, paintings, than, are, depictions, of, animals, or, humans, and, unique, symbolic, patterns, might, have, been, trademarks, that, represent, different, upper, paleolithic, ethnic, groups, venus, figurines, have, evoked, similar, controversy, archaeologists, and, anthropologists, have, described, the, figurines, as, representations, of, goddesses, pornographic, imagery, apotropaic, amulets, used, for, sympathetic, magic, and, even, as, self, portraits, of, women, themselves, r, dale, guthrie, has, studied, not, only, the, most, artistic, and, publicized, paintings, but, also, a, variety, of, lower, quality, art, and, figurines, and, he, identifies, a, wide, range, of, skill, and, ages, among, the, artists, he, also, points, out, that, the, main, themes, in, the, paintings, and, other, artifacts, powerful, beasts, risky, hunting, scenes, and, the, over, sexual, representation, of, women, are, to, be, expected, in, the, fantasies, of, adolescent, males, during, the, upper, paleolithic, the, venus, figurines, have, been, theorized, not, universally, as, representing, a, mother, goddess, the, abundance, of, such, female, imagery, has, inspired, the, theory, that, religion, and, society, in, paleolithic, and, later, neolithic, cultures, were, primarily, interested, in, and, may, have, been, directed, by, women, adherents, of, the, theory, include, archaeologist, marija, gimbutas, and, feminist, scholar, merlin, stone, the, author, of, the, 1976, book, when, god, was, a, woman, other, explanations, for, the, purpose, of, the, figurines, have, been, proposed, such, as, catherine, mccoid, and, leroy, mcdermott, s, hypothesis, that, they, were, self, portraits, of, woman, artists, and, r, dale, gutrie, s, hypothesis, that, served, as, stone, age, pornography, the, origins, of, music, during, the, paleolithic, are, unknown, the, earliest, forms, of, music, probably, did, not, use, musical, instruments, other, than, the, human, voice, or, natural, objects, such, as, rocks, this, early, music, would, not, have, left, an, archaeological, footprint, music, may, have, developed, from, rhythmic, sounds, produced, by, daily, chores, for, example, cracking, open, nuts, with, stones, maintaining, a, rhythm, while, working, may, have, helped, people, to, become, more, efficient, at, daily, activities, an, alternative, theory, originally, proposed, by, charles, darwin, explains, that, music, may, have, begun, as, a, hominin, mating, strategy, bird, and, other, animal, species, produce, music, such, as, calls, to, attract, mates, this, hypothesis, is, generally, less, accepted, than, the, previous, hypothesis, but, nonetheless, provides, a, possible, alternative, upper, paleolithic, and, possibly, middle, paleolithic, humans, used, flute, like, bone, pipes, as, musical, instruments, and, music, may, have, played, a, large, role, in, the, religious, lives, of, upper, paleolithic, hunter, gatherers, as, with, modern, hunter, gatherer, societies, music, may, have, been, used, in, ritual, or, to, help, induce, trances, in, particular, it, appears, that, animal, skin, drums, may, have, been, used, in, religious, events, by, upper, paleolithic, shamans, as, shown, by, the, remains, of, drum, like, instruments, from, some, upper, paleolithic, graves, of, shamans, and, the, ethnographic, record, of, contemporary, hunter, gatherer, shamanic, and, ritual, practices, according, to, james, b, harrod, humankind, first, developed, religious, and, spiritual, beliefs, during, the, middle, paleolithic, or, upper, paleolithic, controversial, scholars, of, prehistoric, religion, and, anthropology, james, harrod, and, vincent, w, fallio, have, recently, proposed, that, religion, and, spirituality, and, art, may, have, first, arisen, in, pre, paleolithic, chimpanzees, or, early, lower, paleolithic, oldowan, societies, according, to, fallio, the, common, ancestor, of, chimpanzees, and, humans, experienced, altered, states, of, consciousness, and, partook, in, ritual, and, ritual, was, used, in, their, societies, to, strengthen, social, bonding, and, group, cohesion, middle, paleolithic, humans, use, of, burials, at, sites, such, as, krapina, croatia, c, 130, 000, bp, and, qafzeh, israel, c, 100, 000, bp, have, led, some, anthropologists, and, archaeologists, such, as, philip, lieberman, to, believe, that, middle, paleolithic, humans, may, have, possessed, a, belief, in, an, afterlife, and, a, concern, for, the, dead, that, transcends, daily, life, cut, marks, on, neanderthal, bones, from, various, sites, such, as, combe, grenal, and, abri, moula, in, france, suggest, that, the, neanderthals, like, some, contemporary, human, cultures, may, have, practiced, ritual, defleshing, for, presumably, religious, reasons, according, to, recent, archaeological, findings, from, homo, heidelbergensis, sites, in, atapuerca, humans, may, have, begun, burying, their, dead, much, earlier, during, the, late, lower, paleolithic, but, this, theory, is, widely, questioned, in, the, scientific, community, likewise, some, scientists, have, proposed, that, middle, paleolithic, societies, such, as, neanderthal, societies, may, also, have, practiced, the, earliest, form, of, totemism, or, animal, worship, in, addition, to, their, presumably, religious, burial, of, the, dead, in, particular, emil, b, chler, suggested, based, on, archaeological, evidence, from, middle, paleolithic, caves, that, a, bear, cult, was, widespread, among, middle, paleolithic, neanderthals, a, claim, that, evidence, was, found, for, middle, paleolithic, animal, worship, c, 70, 000, bce, originates, from, the, tsodilo, hills, in, the, african, kalahari, desert, has, been, denied, by, the, original, investigators, of, the, site, animal, cults, in, the, upper, paleolithic, such, as, the, bear, cult, may, have, had, their, origins, in, these, hypothetical, middle, paleolithic, animal, cults, animal, worship, during, the, upper, paleolithic, was, intertwined, with, hunting, rites, for, instance, archaeological, evidence, from, art, and, bear, remains, reveals, that, the, bear, cult, apparently, involved, a, type, of, sacrificial, bear, ceremonialism, in, which, a, bear, was, shot, with, arrows, finished, off, by, a, shot, or, thrust, in, the, lungs, and, ritually, worshipped, near, a, clay, bear, statue, covered, by, a, bear, fur, with, the, skull, and, the, body, of, the, bear, buried, separately, barbara, ehrenreich, controversially, theorizes, that, the, sacrificial, hunting, rites, of, the, upper, paleolithic, and, by, extension, paleolithic, cooperative, big, game, hunting, gave, rise, to, war, or, warlike, raiding, during, the, following, epipaleolithic, and, mesolithic, or, late, upper, paleolithic, the, existence, of, anthropomorphic, images, and, half, human, half, animal, images, in, the, upper, paleolithic, may, further, indicate, that, upper, paleolithic, humans, were, the, first, people, to, believe, in, a, pantheon, of, gods, or, supernatural, beings, though, such, images, may, instead, indicate, shamanistic, practices, similar, to, those, of, contemporary, tribal, societies, the, earliest, known, undisputed, burial, of, a, shaman, and, by, extension, the, earliest, undisputed, evidence, of, shamans, and, shamanic, practices, dates, back, to, the, early, upper, paleolithic, era, c, 30, 000, bp, in, what, is, now, the, czech, republic, however, during, the, early, upper, paleolithic, it, was, probably, more, common, for, all, members, of, the, band, to, participate, equally, and, fully, in, religious, ceremonies, in, contrast, to, the, religious, traditions, of, later, periods, when, religious, authorities, and, part, time, ritual, specialists, such, as, shamans, priests, and, medicine, men, were, relatively, common, and, integral, to, religious, life, religion, was, possibly, apotropaic, specifically, it, may, have, involved, sympathetic, magic, the, venus, figurines, which, are, abundant, in, the, upper, paleolithic, archaeological, record, provide, an, example, of, possible, paleolithic, sympathetic, magic, as, they, may, have, been, used, for, ensuring, success, in, hunting, and, to, bring, about, fertility, of, the, land, and, women, the, upper, paleolithic, venus, figurines, have, sometimes, been, explained, as, depictions, of, an, earth, goddess, similar, to, gaia, or, as, representations, of, a, goddess, who, is, the, ruler, or, mother, of, the, animals, james, harrod, has, described, them, as, representative, of, female, and, male, shamanistic, spiritual, transformation, processes, paleolithic, hunting, and, gathering, people, ate, varying, proportions, of, vegetables, including, tubers, and, roots, fruit, seeds, including, nuts, and, wild, grass, seeds, and, insects, meat, fish, and, shellfish, however, there, is, little, direct, evidence, of, the, relative, proportions, of, plant, and, animal, foods, although, the, term, paleolithic, diet, without, references, to, a, specific, timeframe, or, locale, is, sometimes, used, with, an, implication, that, most, humans, shared, a, certain, diet, during, the, entire, era, that, is, not, entirely, accurate, the, paleolithic, was, an, extended, period, of, time, during, which, multiple, technological, advances, were, made, many, of, which, had, impact, on, human, dietary, structure, for, example, humans, probably, did, not, possess, the, control, of, fire, until, the, middle, paleolithic, or, tools, necessary, to, engage, in, extensive, fishing, on, the, other, hand, both, these, technologies, are, generally, agreed, to, have, been, widely, available, to, humans, by, the, end, of, the, paleolithic, consequently, allowing, humans, in, some, regions, of, the, planet, to, rely, heavily, on, fishing, and, hunting, in, addition, the, paleolithic, involved, a, substantial, geographical, expansion, of, human, populations, during, the, lower, paleolithic, ancestors, of, modern, humans, are, thought, to, have, been, constrained, to, africa, east, of, the, great, rift, valley, during, the, middle, and, upper, paleolithic, humans, greatly, expanded, their, area, of, settlement, reaching, ecosystems, as, diverse, as, new, guinea, and, alaska, and, adapting, their, diets, to, whatever, local, resources, were, available, another, view, is, that, until, the, upper, paleolithic, humans, were, frugivores, fruit, eaters, who, supplemented, their, meals, with, carrion, eggs, and, small, prey, such, as, baby, birds, and, mussels, and, only, on, rare, occasions, managed, to, kill, and, consume, big, game, such, as, antelopes, this, view, is, supported, by, studies, of, higher, apes, particularly, chimpanzees, chimpanzees, are, the, closest, to, humans, genetically, sharing, more, than, 96, of, their, dna, code, with, humans, and, their, digestive, tract, is, functionally, very, similar, to, that, of, humans, chimpanzees, are, primarily, frugivores, but, they, could, and, would, consume, and, digest, animal, flesh, given, the, opportunity, in, general, their, actual, diet, in, the, wild, is, about, 95, plant, based, with, the, remaining, 5, filled, with, insects, eggs, and, baby, animals, in, some, ecosystems, however, chimpanzees, are, predatory, forming, parties, to, hunt, monkeys, some, comparative, studies, of, human, and, higher, primate, digestive, tracts, do, suggest, that, humans, have, evolved, to, obtain, greater, amounts, of, calories, from, sources, such, as, animal, foods, allowing, them, to, shrink, the, size, of, the, gastrointestinal, tract, relative, to, body, mass, and, to, increase, the, brain, mass, instead, anthropologists, have, diverse, opinions, about, the, proportions, of, plant, and, animal, foods, consumed, just, as, with, still, existing, hunters, and, gatherers, there, were, many, varied, diets, in, different, groups, and, also, varying, through, this, vast, amount, of, time, some, paleolithic, hunter, gatherers, consumed, a, significant, amount, of, meat, and, possibly, obtained, most, of, their, food, from, hunting, while, others, were, believed, to, have, a, primarily, plant, based, diet, most, if, not, all, are, believed, to, have, been, opportunistic, omnivores, one, hypothesis, is, that, carbohydrate, tubers, plant, underground, storage, organs, may, have, been, eaten, in, high, amounts, by, pre, agricultural, humans, it, is, thought, that, the, paleolithic, diet, included, as, much, as, 1, 65, 1, 9, kg, 3, 6, 4, 2, lb, per, day, of, fruit, and, vegetables, the, relative, proportions, of, plant, and, animal, foods, in, the, diets, of, paleolithic, people, often, varied, between, regions, with, more, meat, being, necessary, in, colder, regions, which, were, not, populated, by, anatomically, modern, humans, until, c, 30, 000, c, 50, 000, bp, it, is, generally, agreed, that, many, modern, hunting, and, fishing, tools, such, as, fish, hooks, nets, bows, and, poisons, were, not, introduced, until, the, upper, paleolithic, and, possibly, even, neolithic, the, only, hunting, tools, widely, available, to, humans, during, any, significant, part, of, the, paleolithic, were, hand, held, spears, and, harpoons, there, is, evidence, of, paleolithic, people, killing, and, eating, seals, and, elands, as, far, as, c, 100, 000, bp, on, the, other, hand, buffalo, bones, found, in, african, caves, from, the, same, period, are, typically, of, very, young, or, very, old, individuals, and, there, is, no, evidence, that, pigs, elephants, or, rhinos, were, hunted, by, humans, at, the, time, paleolithic, peoples, suffered, less, famine, and, malnutrition, than, the, neolithic, farming, tribes, that, followed, them, this, was, partly, because, paleolithic, hunter, gatherers, accessed, a, wider, variety, of, natural, foods, which, allowed, them, a, more, nutritious, diet, and, a, decreased, risk, of, famine, many, of, the, famines, experienced, by, neolithic, and, some, modern, farmers, were, caused, or, amplified, by, their, dependence, on, a, small, number, of, crops, it, is, thought, that, wild, foods, can, have, a, significantly, different, nutritional, profile, than, cultivated, foods, the, greater, amount, of, meat, obtained, by, hunting, big, game, animals, in, paleolithic, diets, than, neolithic, diets, may, have, also, allowed, paleolithic, hunter, gatherers, to, enjoy, a, more, nutritious, diet, than, neolithic, agriculturalists, it, has, been, argued, that, the, shift, from, hunting, and, gathering, to, agriculture, resulted, in, an, increasing, focus, on, a, limited, variety, of, foods, with, meat, likely, taking, a, back, seat, to, plants, it, is, also, unlikely, that, paleolithic, hunter, gatherers, were, affected, by, modern, diseases, of, affluence, such, as, type, 2, diabetes, coronary, heart, disease, and, cerebrovascular, disease, because, they, ate, mostly, lean, meats, and, plants, and, frequently, engaged, in, intense, physical, activity, and, because, the, average, lifespan, was, shorter, than, the, age, of, common, onset, of, these, conditions, large, seeded, legumes, were, part, of, the, human, diet, long, before, the, neolithic, revolution, as, evident, from, archaeobotanical, finds, from, the, mousterian, layers, of, kebara, cave, in, israel, there, is, evidence, suggesting, that, paleolithic, societies, were, gathering, wild, cereals, for, food, use, at, least, as, early, as, 30, 000, years, ago, however, seeds, such, as, grains, and, beans, were, rarely, eaten, and, never, in, large, quantities, on, a, daily, basis, recent, archaeological, evidence, also, indicates, that, winemaking, may, have, originated, in, the, paleolithic, when, early, humans, drank, the, juice, of, naturally, fermented, wild, grapes, from, animal, skin, pouches, paleolithic, humans, consumed, animal, organ, meats, including, the, livers, kidneys, and, brains, upper, paleolithic, cultures, appear, to, have, had, significant, knowledge, about, plants, and, herbs, and, may, have, sometimes, practiced, rudimentary, forms, of, horticulture, in, particular, bananas, and, tubers, may, have, been, cultivated, as, early, as, 25, 000, bp, in, southeast, asia, in, the, paleolithic, levant, 23, 000, years, ago, cereals, cultivation, of, emmer, barley, and, oats, has, been, observed, near, the, sea, of, galilee, late, upper, paleolithic, societies, also, appear, to, have, occasionally, practiced, pastoralism, and, animal, husbandry, presumably, for, dietary, reasons, for, instance, some, european, late, upper, paleolithic, cultures, domesticated, and, raised, reindeer, presumably, for, their, meat, or, milk, as, early, as, 14, 000, bp, humans, also, probably, consumed, hallucinogenic, plants, during, the, paleolithic, the, aboriginal, australians, have, been, consuming, a, variety, of, native, animal, and, plant, foods, called, bushfood, for, an, estimated, 60, 000, years, since, the, middle, paleolithic, in, february, 2019, scientists, reported, evidence, based, on, isotope, studies, that, at, least, some, neanderthals, may, have, eaten, meat, people, during, the, middle, paleolithic, such, as, the, neanderthals, and, middle, paleolithic, homo, sapiens, in, africa, began, to, catch, shellfish, for, food, as, revealed, by, shellfish, cooking, in, neanderthal, sites, in, italy, about, 110, 000, years, ago, and, in, middle, paleolithic, homo, sapiens, sites, at, pinnacle, point, south, africa, around, 164, 000, bp, although, fishing, only, became, common, during, the, upper, paleolithic, fish, have, been, part, of, human, diets, long, before, the, dawn, of, the, upper, paleolithic, and, have, certainly, been, consumed, by, humans, since, at, least, the, middle, paleolithic, for, example, the, middle, paleolithic, homo, sapiens, in, the, region, now, occupied, by, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, hunted, large, 6, ft, 1, 8, m, long, catfish, with, specialized, barbed, fishing, points, as, early, as, 90, 000, years, ago, the, invention, of, fishing, allowed, some, upper, paleolithic, and, later, hunter, gatherer, societies, to, become, sedentary, or, semi, nomadic, which, altered, their, social, structures, example, societies, are, the, lepenski, vir, as, well, as, some, contemporary, hunter, gatherers, such, as, the, tlingit, in, some, instances, at, least, the, tlingit, they, developed, social, stratification, slavery, and, complex, social, structures, such, as, chiefdoms, anthropologists, such, as, tim, white, suggest, that, cannibalism, was, common, in, human, societies, prior, to, the, beginning, of, the, upper, paleolithic, based, on, the, large, amount, of, butchered, human, bones, found, in, neanderthal, and, other, lower, middle, paleolithic, sites, cannibalism, in, the, lower, and, middle, paleolithic, may, have, occurred, because, of, food, shortages, however, it, may, have, been, for, religious, reasons, and, would, coincide, with, the, development, of, religious, practices, thought, to, have, occurred, during, the, upper, paleolithic, nonetheless, it, remains, possible, that, paleolithic, societies, never, practiced, cannibalism, and, that, the, damage, to, recovered, human, bones, was, either, the, result, of, excarnation, or, predation, by, carnivores, such, as, saber, toothed, cats, lions, and, hyenas, a, modern, day, diet, known, as, the, paleolithic, diet, exists, based, on, restricting, consumption, only, to, those, foods, presumed, to, be, available, to, anatomically, modern, humans, prior, to, the, advent, of, settled, agriculture
