president, richard, nixon, although, eisenhower, warned, kennedy, about, laos, and, vietnam, europe, and, latin, america, loomed, larger, than, asia, on, his, sights, 264, in, june, 1961, he, bitterly, disagreed, with, soviet, premier, nikita, khrushchev, when, they, met, in, vienna, to, discuss, key, u, s, soviet, issues, only, 16, months, later, the, cuban, missile, crisis, october, 1962, played, out, on, television, worldwide, it, was, the, closest, the, cold, war, came, to, nuclear, war, the, kennedy, administration, remained, committed, to, the, cold, war, foreign, policy, inherited, from, the, truman, and, eisenhower, administrations, in, 1961, the, us, had, 50, 000, troops, based, in, south, korea, and, kennedy, faced, four, crisis, situations, the, failure, of, the, bay, of, pigs, invasion, he, had, approved, in, april, settlement, negotiations, between, the, pro, western, government, of, laos, and, the, pathet, lao, communist, movement, in, may, 265, construction, of, the, berlin, wall, in, august, and, the, cuban, missile, crisis, in, october, kennedy, believed, another, failure, to, stop, communist, expansion, would, irreparably, damage, us, credibility, he, was, determined, to, draw, a, line, in, the, sand, and, prevent, a, communist, victory, in, vietnam, he, told, james, reston, of, the, new, york, times, after, the, vienna, summit, with, khrushchev, now, we, have, a, problem, making, our, power, credible, and, vietnam, looks, like, the, place, kennedy, s, policy, toward, south, vietnam, assumed, di, m, and, his, forces, had, to, defeat, the, guerrillas, on, their, own, he, was, against, the, deployment, of, american, combat, troops, and, observed, to, introduce, u, s, forces, in, large, numbers, there, today, while, it, might, have, an, initially, favorable, military, impact, would, almost, certainly, lead, to, adverse, political, and, in, the, long, run, adverse, military, consequences, the, quality, of, the, south, vietnamese, military, however, remained, poor, poor, leadership, corruption, and, political, promotions, weakened, the, arvn, the, frequency, of, guerrilla, attacks, rose, as, the, insurgency, gathered, steam, while, hanoi, s, support, for, the, viet, cong, played, a, role, south, vietnamese, governmental, incompetence, was, at, the, core, of, the, crisis, 369, one, major, issue, kennedy, raised, was, whether, the, soviet, space, and, missile, programs, had, surpassed, those, of, the, us, although, kennedy, stressed, long, range, missile, parity, with, the, soviets, he, was, interested, in, using, special, forces, for, counterinsurgency, warfare, in, third, world, countries, threatened, by, communist, insurgencies, although, they, were, intended, for, use, behind, front, lines, after, a, conventional, soviet, invasion, of, europe, kennedy, believed, guerrilla, tactics, employed, by, special, forces, such, as, the, green, berets, would, be, effective, in, a, brush, fire, war, in, vietnam, kennedy, advisors, maxwell, taylor, and, walt, rostow, recommended, us, troops, be, sent, to, south, vietnam, disguised, as, flood, relief, workers, kennedy, rejected, the, idea, but, increased, military, assistance, in, april, 1962, john, kenneth, galbraith, warned, kennedy, of, the, danger, we, shall, replace, the, french, as, a, colonial, force, in, the, area, and, bleed, as, the, french, did, eisenhower, put, 900, advisors, in, vietnam, and, by, november, 1963, kennedy, had, put, 16, 000, military, personnel, there, 131, the, strategic, hamlet, program, was, initiated, in, late, 1961, this, joint, u, s, south, vietnamese, program, attempted, to, resettle, the, rural, population, into, fortified, villages, it, was, implemented, in, early, 1962, and, involved, some, forced, relocation, and, segregation, of, rural, south, vietnamese, into, new, communities, where, the, peasantry, would, be, isolated, from, the, viet, cong, it, was, hoped, these, new, communities, would, provide, security, for, the, peasants, and, strengthen, the, tie, between, them, and, the, central, government, however, by, november, 1963, the, program, had, waned, and, it, ended, in, 1964, 1070, in, july, 1962, 14, nations, including, china, south, vietnam, the, soviet, union, north, vietnam, and, the, us, signed, an, agreement, promising, to, respect, laos, neutrality, the, inept, performance, of, the, arvn, was, exemplified, by, failed, actions, such, as, the, battle, of, p, b, c, on, 2, january, 1963, in, which, a, band, of, viet, cong, won, a, battle, against, a, much, larger, and, better, equipped, south, vietnamese, force, many, of, whose, officers, seemed, reluctant, even, to, engage, in, combat, 201, 206, the, south, vietnamese, lost, 83, soldiers, and, 5, us, war, helicopters, serving, to, ferry, troops, shot, down, by, vietcong, forces, while, the, vietcong, lost, only, 18, soldiers, the, arvn, forces, were, led, by, di, m, s, most, trusted, general, hu, nh, v, n, cao, cao, was, a, catholic, promoted, due, to, religion, and, fidelity, rather, than, skill, and, his, main, job, was, to, preserve, his, forces, to, stave, off, coups, policymakers, in, washington, began, to, conclude, di, m, was, incapable, of, defeating, the, communists, and, might, even, make, a, deal, with, ho, chi, minh, he, seemed, concerned, only, with, fending, off, coups, and, had, become, paranoid, after, attempts, in, 1960, and, 1962, which, he, partly, attributed, to, us, encouragement, as, robert, f, kennedy, noted, di, m, wouldn, t, make, even, the, slightest, concessions, he, was, difficult, to, reason, with, historian, james, gibson, summed, up, the, situation, strategic, hamlets, had, failed, the, south, vietnamese, regime, was, incapable, of, winning, the, peasantry, because, of, its, class, base, among, landlords, indeed, there, was, no, longer, a, regime, in, the, sense, of, a, relatively, stable, political, alliance, and, functioning, bureaucracy, instead, civil, government, and, military, operations, had, virtually, ceased, the, national, liberation, front, had, made, great, progress, and, was, close, to, declaring, provisional, revolutionary, governments, in, large, areas, discontent, with, di, m, s, policies, exploded, in, may, 1963, following, the, hu, ph, t, n, shootings, of, 9, buddhists, protesting, the, ban, on, displaying, the, buddhist, flag, on, vesak, buddha, s, birthday, this, resulted, in, mass, protests, the, buddhist, crisis, against, discriminatory, policies, that, gave, privileges, to, catholics,

hundreds, us, officials, began, discussing, regime, change, during, the, middle, of, 1963, the, united, states, department, of, state, wanted, to, encourage, a, coup, while, the, pentagon, favored, di, m, chief, among, the, proposed, changes, was, removal, of, di, m, s, younger, brother, nhu, who, controlled, the, secret, police, and, special, forces, and, was, seen, as, being, behind, the, buddhist, repression, and, the, architect, of, the, ng, family, s, rule, this, proposal, was, conveyed, to, the, us, embassy, in, saigon, in, cable, 243, the, cia, contacted, generals, planning, to, remove, di, m, and, told, them, the, us, would, not, oppose, such, a, move, nor, punish, them, by, cutting, off, aid, di, m, was, executed, along, with, his, brother, on, 2, november, 1963, when, kennedy, was, informed, maxwell, taylor, remembered, he, rushed, from, the, room, with, a, look, of, shock, and, dismay, on, his, face, 326, kennedy, had, not, anticipated, di, m, s, murder, the, u, s, ambassador, henry, cabot, lodge, invited, the, coup, leaders, to, the, embassy, and, congratulated, them, lodge, informed, kennedy, that, the, prospects, now, are, for, a, shorter, war, 327,

puppet, of, the, americans, whatever, the, failings, of, di, m, his, credentials, as, a, nationalist, had, been, impeccable, 328, us, advisors, were, embedded, at, every, level, of, the, south, vietnamese, armed, forces, they, were, however, criticized, for, ignoring, the, political, nature, of, the, insurgency, the, kennedy, administration, sought, to, refocus, us, efforts, on, pacification, which, in, this, case, was, defined, as, countering, the, growing, threat, of, insurgency, and, winning, the, hearts, and, minds, of, the, population, military, leadership, in, washington, however, was, hostile, to, any, role, for, u, s, advisors, other, than, troop, training, general, paul, harkins, the, commander, of, u, s, forces, in, south, vietnam, confidently,

by, the, end, of, 1967, johnson, did, not, communicate, this, change, in, strategy, to, the, media, instead, he, emphasized, continuity, the, change, in, policy, depended, on, matching, the, north,
