the, neolithic, revolution, also, known, as, the, first, agricultural, revolution, was, the, wide, scale, transition, of, many, human, cultures, during, the, neolithic, period, in, afro, eurasia, from, a, lifestyle, of, hunting, and, gathering, to, one, of, agriculture, and, settlement, making, an, increasingly, large, population, possible, these, settled, communities, permitted, humans, to, observe, and, experiment, with, plants, learning, how, they, grew, and, developed, this, new, knowledge, led, to, the, domestication, of, plants, into, crops, archaeological, data, indicates, that, the, domestication, of, various, types, of, plants, and, animals, happened, in, separate, locations, worldwide, starting, in, the, geological, epoch, of, the, holocene, 11, 700, years, ago, after, the, end, of, the, last, ice, age, it, was, humankind, s, first, historically, verifiable, transition, to, agriculture, the, neolithic, revolution, greatly, narrowed, the, diversity, of, foods, available, resulting, in, a, decrease, in, the, quality, of, human, nutrition, compared, with, that, obtained, previously, from, foraging, but, because, food, production, became, more, efficient, it, released, humans, to, invest, their, efforts, in, other, activities, and, was, thus, ultimately, necessary, to, the, rise, of, modern, civilization, by, creating, the, foundation, for, the, later, process, of, industrialization, and, sustained, economic, growth, the, neolithic, revolution, involved, much, more, than, the, adoption, of, a, limited, set, of, food, producing, techniques, during, the, next, millennia, it, transformed, the, small, and, mobile, groups, of, hunter, gatherers, that, had, hitherto, dominated, human, prehistory, into, sedentary, non, nomadic, societies, based, in, built, up, villages, and, towns, these, societies, radically, modified, their, natural, environment, by, means, of, specialized, food, crop, cultivation, with, activities, such, as, irrigation, and, deforestation, which, allowed, the, production, of, surplus, food, other, developments, that, are, found, very, widely, during, this, era, are, the, domestication, of, animals, pottery, polished, stone, tools, and, rectangular, houses, in, many, regions, the, adoption, of, agriculture, by, prehistoric, societies, caused, episodes, of, rapid, population, growth, a, phenomenon, known, as, the, neolithic, demographic, transition, these, developments, sometimes, called, the, neolithic, package, provided, the, basis, for, centralized, administrations, and, political, structures, hierarchical, ideologies, depersonalized, systems, of, knowledge, e, g, writing, densely, populated, settlements, specialization, and, division, of, labour, more, trade, the, development, of, non, portable, art, and, architecture, and, greater, property, ownership, the, earliest, known, civilization, developed, in, sumer, in, southern, mesopotamia, c, 6, 500, bp, its, emergence, also, heralded, the, beginning, of, the, bronze, age, the, relationship, of, the, aforementioned, neolithic, characteristics, to, the, onset, of, agriculture, their, sequence, of, emergence, and, their, empirical, relation, to, each, other, at, various, neolithic, sites, remains, the, subject, of, academic, debate, it, is, usually, understood, to, vary, from, place, to, place, rather, than, being, the, outcome, of, universal, laws, of, social, evolution, hunter, gatherers, had, different, subsistence, requirements, and, lifestyles, from, agriculturalists, hunter, gatherers, were, often, highly, mobile, and, migratory, living, in, temporary, shelters, and, in, small, tribal, groups, and, having, limited, contact, with, outsiders, their, diet, was, well, balanced, though, heavily, dependent, on, what, the, environment, could, provide, each, season, in, contrast, because, the, surplus, and, plannable, supply, of, food, provided, by, agriculture, made, it, possible, to, support, larger, population, groups, agriculturalists, lived, in, more, permanent, dwellings, in, more, densely, populated, settlements, than, what, could, be, supported, by, a, hunter, gatherer, lifestyle, the, agricultural, communities, seasonal, need, to, plan, and, coordinate, resource, and, manpower, encouraged, division, of, labour, which, gradually, led, to, specialization, of, labourers, and, complex, societies, the, subsequent, development, of, trading, networks, to, exchange, surplus, commodities, and, services, brought, agriculturalists, into, contact, with, outside, groups, which, promoted, cultural, exchanges, that, led, to, the, rise, of, civilizations, and, technological, evolutions, however, higher, population, and, food, abundance, did, not, necessarily, correlate, with, improved, health, reliance, on, a, very, limited, variety, of, staple, crops, can, adversely, affect, health, even, while, making, it, possible, to, feed, more, people, maize, is, deficient, in, certain, essential, amino, acids, lysine, and, tryptophan, and, is, a, poor, source, of, iron, the, phytic, acid, it, contains, may, inhibit, nutrient, absorption, other, factors, that, likely, affected, the, health, of, early, agriculturalists, and, their, domesticated, livestock, would, have, been, increased, numbers, of, parasites, and, disease, bearing, pests, associated, with, human, waste, and, contaminated, food, and, water, supplies, fertilizers, and, irrigation, may, have, increased, crop, yields, but, also, would, have, promoted, proliferation, of, insects, and, bacteria, in, the, local, environment, while, grain, storage, attracted, additional, insects, and, rodents, the, term, neolithic, revolution, was, invented, by, v, gordon, childe, in, his, book, man, makes, himself, 1936, childe, introduced, it, as, the, first, in, a, series, of, agricultural, revolutions, in, middle, eastern, history, calling, it, a, revolution, to, denote, its, significance, the, degree, of, change, to, communities, adopting, and, refining, agricultural, practices, the, beginning, of, this, process, in, different, regions, has, been, dated, from, 10, 000, to, 8, 000, bce, in, the, fertile, crescent, and, perhaps, 8000, bce, in, the, kuk, early, agricultural, site, of, papua, new, guinea, in, melanesia, everywhere, this, transition, is, associated, with, a, change, from, a, largely, nomadic, hunter, gatherer, way, of, life, to, a, more, settled, agrarian, one, with, the, domestication, of, various, plant, and, animal, species, depending, on, the, species, locally, available, and, influenced, by, local, culture, archaeological, research, in, 2003, suggests, that, in, some, regions, such, as, the, southeast, asian, peninsula, the, transition, from, hunter, gatherer, to, agriculturalist, was, not, linear, but, region, specific, the, most, prominent, of, several, theories, not, mutually, exclusive, as, to, factors, that, caused, populations, to, develop, agriculture, include, use, wear, analysis, of, five, glossed, flint, blades, found, at, ohalo, ii, a, 23, 000, years, old, fisher, hunter, gatherers, camp, on, the, shore, of, the, sea, of, galilee, northern, israel, provides, the, earliest, evidence, for, the, use, of, composite, cereal, harvesting, tools, the, ohalo, site, is, at, the, junction, of, the, upper, paleolithic, and, the, early, epipaleolithic, and, has, been, attributed, to, both, periods, the, wear, traces, indicate, that, tools, were, used, for, harvesting, near, ripe, semi, green, wild, cereals, shortly, before, grains, are, ripe, and, disperse, naturally, the, studied, tools, were, not, used, intensively, and, they, reflect, two, harvesting, modes, flint, knives, held, by, hand, and, inserts, hafted, in, a, handle, the, finds, shed, new, light, on, cereal, harvesting, techniques, some, 8, 000, years, before, the, natufian, and, 12, 000, years, before, the, establishment, of, sedentary, farming, communities, in, the, near, east, furthermore, the, new, finds, accord, well, with, evidence, for, the, earliest, ever, cereal, cultivation, at, the, site, and, the, use, of, stone, made, grinding, implements, once, agriculture, started, gaining, momentum, around, 9000, bp, human, activity, resulted, in, the, selective, breeding, of, cereal, grasses, beginning, with, emmer, einkorn, and, barley, and, not, simply, of, those, that, favoured, greater, caloric, returns, through, larger, seeds, plants, with, traits, such, as, small, seeds, or, bitter, taste, were, seen, as, undesirable, plants, that, rapidly, shed, their, seeds, on, maturity, tended, not, to, be, gathered, at, harvest, therefore, not, stored, and, not, seeded, the, following, season, successive, years, of, harvesting, spontaneously, selected, for, strains, that, retained, their, edible, seeds, longer, daniel, zohary, identified, several, plant, species, as, pioneer, crops, or, neolithic, founder, crops, he, highlighted, the, importance, of, wheat, barley, and, rye, and, suggested, that, domestication, of, flax, peas, chickpeas, bitter, vetch, and, lentils, came, a, little, later, based, on, analysis, of, the, genes, of, domesticated, plants, he, preferred, theories, of, a, single, or, at, most, a, very, small, number, of, domestication, events, for, each, taxon, that, spread, in, an, arc, from, the, levantine, corridor, around, the, fertile, crescent, and, later, into, europe, gordon, hillman, and, stuart, davies, carried, out, experiments, with, varieties, of, wild, wheat, to, show, that, the, process, of, domestication, would, have, occurred, over, a, relatively, short, period, of, between, 20, and, 200, years, some, of, the, pioneering, attempts, failed, at, first, and, crops, were, abandoned, sometimes, to, be, taken, up, again, and, successfully, domesticated, thousands, of, years, later, rye, tried, and, abandoned, in, neolithic, anatolia, made, its, way, to, europe, as, weed, seeds, and, was, successfully, domesticated, in, europe, thousands, of, years, after, the, earliest, agriculture, wild, lentils, presented, a, different, problem, most, of, the, wild, seeds, do, not, germinate, in, the, first, year, the, first, evidence, of, lentil, domestication, breaking, dormancy, in, their, first, year, appears, in, the, early, neolithic, at, jerf, el, ahmar, in, modern, syria, and, lentils, quickly, spread, south, to, the, netiv, hagdud, site, in, the, jordan, valley, the, process, of, domestication, allowed, the, founder, crops, to, adapt, and, eventually, become, larger, more, easily, harvested, more, dependable, in, storage, and, more, useful, to, the, human, population, selectively, propagated, figs, wild, barley, and, wild, oats, were, cultivated, at, the, early, neolithic, site, of, gilgal, i, where, in, 2006, archaeologists, found, caches, of, seeds, of, each, in, quantities, too, large, to, be, accounted, for, even, by, intensive, gathering, at, strata, datable, to, c, 11, 000, years, ago, some, of, the, plants, tried, and, then, abandoned, during, the, neolithic, period, in, the, ancient, near, east, at, sites, like, gilgal, were, later, successfully, domesticated, in, other, parts, of, the, world, once, early, farmers, perfected, their, agricultural, techniques, like, irrigation, traced, as, far, back, as, the, 6th, millennium, bce, in, khuzistan, their, crops, yielded, surpluses, that, needed, storage, most, hunter, gatherers, could, not, easily, store, food, for, long, due, to, their, migratory, lifestyle, whereas, those, with, a, sedentary, dwelling, could, store, their, surplus, grain, eventually, granaries, were, developed, that, allowed, villages, to, store, their, seeds, longer, so, with, more, food, the, population, expanded, and, communities, developed, specialized, workers, and, more, advanced, tools, the, process, was, not, as, linear, as, was, once, thought, but, a, more, complicated, effort, which, was, undertaken, by, different, human, populations, in, different, regions, in, many, different, ways, one, of, the, world, s, most, important, crops, barley, was, domesticated, in, the, near, east, around, 11, 000, years, ago, c, 9, 000, bce, barley, is, a, highly, resilient, crop, able, to, grow, in, varied, and, marginal, environments, such, as, in, regions, of, high, altitude, and, latitude, archaeobotanical, evidence, shows, that, barley, had, spread, throughout, eurasia, by, 2, 000, bce, to, further, elucidate, the, routes, by, which, barley, cultivation, was, spread, through, eurasia, genetic, analysis, was, used, to, determine, genetic, diversity, and, population, structure, in, extant, barley, taxa, genetic, analysis, shows, that, cultivated, barley, spread, through, eurasia, via, several, different, routes, which, were, most, likely, separated, in, both, time, and, space, agriculture, appeared, first, in, southwest, asia, about, 2, 000, years, later, around, 10, 000, 9, 000, years, ago, the, region, was, the, centre, of, domestication, for, three, cereals, einkorn, wheat, emmer, wheat, and, barley, four, legumes, lentil, pea, bitter, vetch, and, chickpea, and, flax, domestication, was, a, slow, process, that, unfolded, across, multiple, regions, and, was, preceded, by, centuries, if, not, millennia, of, pre, domestication, cultivation, finds, of, large, quantities, of, seeds, and, a, grinding, stone, at, the, epipalaeolithic, site, of, ohalo, ii, dating, to, around, 19, 400, bp, has, shown, some, of, the, earliest, evidence, for, advanced, planning, of, plants, for, food, consumption, and, suggests, that, humans, at, ohalo, ii, processed, the, grain, before, consumption, tell, aswad, is, the, oldest, site, of, agriculture, with, domesticated, emmer, wheat, dated, to, 10, 800, bp, soon, after, came, hulled, two, row, barley, found, domesticated, earliest, at, jericho, in, the, jordan, valley, and, at, iraq, ed, dubb, in, jordan, other, sites, in, the, levantine, corridor, that, show, early, evidence, of, agriculture, include, wadi, faynan, 16, and, netiv, hagdud, jacques, cauvin, noted, that, the, settlers, of, aswad, did, not, domesticate, on, site, but, arrived, perhaps, from, the, neighbouring, anti, lebanon, already, equipped, with, the, seed, for, planting, in, the, eastern, fertile, crescent, evidence, of, cultivation, of, wild, plants, has, been, found, in, choga, gholan, in, iran, dated, to, 12, 000, bp, with, domesticated, emmer, wheat, appearing, in, 9, 800, bp, suggesting, there, may, have, been, multiple, regions, in, the, fertile, crescent, where, cereal, domestication, evolved, roughly, contemporaneously, the, heavy, neolithic, qaraoun, culture, has, been, identified, at, around, fifty, sites, in, lebanon, around, the, source, springs, of, the, river, jordan, but, never, reliably, dated, in, his, book, guns, germs, and, steel, jared, diamond, argues, that, the, vast, continuous, east, west, stretch, of, temperate, climatic, zones, of, eurasia, and, north, africa, gave, peoples, living, there, a, highly, advantageous, geographical, location, that, afforded, them, a, head, start, in, the, neolithic, revolution, both, shared, the, temperate, climate, ideal, for, the, first, agricultural, settings, both, were, near, a, number, of, easily, domesticable, plant, and, animal, species, in, areas, where, continents, aligned, north, south, such, as, the, americas, and, africa, crops, and, later, domesticated, animals, could, not, spread, across, tropical, zones, archaeologists, trace, the, emergence, of, food, producing, societies, in, the, levantine, region, of, southwest, asia, at, the, close, of, the, last, glacial, period, around, 12, 000, bce, and, developed, into, a, number, of, regionally, distinctive, cultures, by, the, eighth, millennium, bce, remains, of, food, producing, societies, in, the, aegean, have, been, carbon, dated, to, c, 6500, bce, at, knossos, franchthi, cave, and, a, number, of, mainland, sites, in, thessaly, neolithic, groups, appear, soon, afterwards, in, the, balkans, and, south, central, europe, the, neolithic, cultures, of, southeastern, europe, the, balkans, and, the, aegean, show, some, continuity, with, groups, in, southwest, asia, and, anatolia, e, g, atalh, y, k, current, evidence, suggests, that, neolithic, material, culture, was, introduced, to, europe, via, western, anatolia, all, neolithic, sites, in, europe, contain, ceramics, and, contain, the, plants, and, animals, domesticated, in, southwest, asia, einkorn, emmer, barley, lentils, pigs, goats, sheep, and, cattle, genetic, data, suggest, that, no, independent, domestication, of, animals, took, place, in, neolithic, europe, and, that, all, domesticated, animals, were, originally, domesticated, in, southwest, asia, the, only, domesticate, not, from, southwest, asia, was, broomcorn, millet, domesticated, in, east, asia, the, earliest, evidence, of, cheese, making, dates, to, 5500, bce, in, kujawy, poland, the, diffusion, across, europe, from, the, aegean, to, britain, took, about, 2, 500, years, 8500, 6000, bp, the, baltic, region, was, penetrated, a, bit, later, around, 5500, bp, and, there, was, also, a, delay, in, settling, the, pannonian, plain, in, general, colonization, shows, a, saltatory, pattern, as, the, neolithic, advanced, from, one, patch, of, fertile, alluvial, soil, to, another, bypassing, mountainous, areas, analysis, of, radiocarbon, dates, show, clearly, that, mesolithic, and, neolithic, populations, lived, side, by, side, for, as, much, as, a, millennium, in, many, parts, of, europe, especially, in, the, iberian, peninsula, and, along, the, atlantic, coast, the, spread, of, the, neolithic, from, the, near, east, neolithic, to, europe, was, first, studied, quantitatively, in, the, 1970s, when, a, sufficient, number, of, carbon, 14, age, determinations, for, early, neolithic, sites, had, become, available, in, 1973, ammerman, and, cavalli, sforza, discovered, a, linear, relationship, between, the, age, of, an, early, neolithic, site, and, its, distance, from, the, conventional, source, in, the, near, east, jericho, demonstrating, that, the, neolithic, spread, at, an, average, speed, of, about, 1, km, yr, more, recent, studies, 2005, confirm, these, results, and, yield, the, speed, of, 0, 6, 1, 3, km, yr, at, 95, confidence, level, since, the, original, human, expansions, out, of, africa, 200, 000, years, ago, different, prehistoric, and, historic, migration, events, have, taken, place, in, europe, considering, that, the, movement, of, the, people, implies, a, consequent, movement, of, their, genes, it, is, possible, to, estimate, the, impact, of, these, migrations, through, the, genetic, analysis, of, human, populations, agricultural, and, husbandry, practices, originated, 10, 000, years, ago, in, a, region, of, the, near, east, known, as, the, fertile, crescent, according, to, the, archaeological, record, this, phenomenon, known, as, neolithic, rapidly, expanded, from, these, territories, into, europe, however, whether, this, diffusion, was, accompanied, or, not, by, human, migrations, is, greatly, debated, mitochondrial, dna, a, type, of, maternally, inherited, dna, located, in, the, cell, cytoplasm, was, recovered, from, the, remains, of, pre, pottery, neolithic, b, ppnb, farmers, in, the, near, east, and, then, compared, to, available, data, from, other, neolithic, populations, in, europe, and, also, to, modern, populations, from, south, eastern, europe, and, the, near, east, the, obtained, results, show, that, substantial, human, migrations, were, involved, in, the, neolithic, spread, and, suggest, that, the, first, neolithic, farmers, entered, europe, following, a, maritime, route, through, cyprus, and, the, aegean, islands, the, earliest, neolithic, sites, in, south, asia, are, bhirrana, in, haryana, dated, to, 7570, 6200, bce, and, mehrgarh, dated, to, between, 6500, and, 5500, bp, in, the, kachi, plain, of, balochistan, pakistan, the, site, has, evidence, of, farming, wheat, and, barley, and, herding, cattle, sheep, and, goats, there, is, strong, evidence, for, causal, connections, between, the, near, eastern, neolithic, and, that, further, east, up, to, the, indus, valley, there, are, several, lines, of, evidence, that, support, the, idea, of, connection, between, the, neolithic, in, the, near, east, and, in, the, indian, subcontinent, the, prehistoric, site, of, mehrgarh, in, baluchistan, modern, pakistan, is, the, earliest, neolithic, site, in, the, north, west, indian, subcontinent, dated, as, early, as, 8500, bce, neolithic, domesticated, crops, in, mehrgarh, include, more, than, 90, barley, and, a, small, amount, of, wheat, there, is, good, evidence, for, the, local, domestication, of, barley, and, the, zebu, cattle, at, mehrgarh, but, the, wheat, varieties, are, suggested, to, be, of, near, eastern, origin, as, the, modern, distribution, of, wild, varieties, of, wheat, is, limited, to, northern, levant, and, southern, turkey, a, detailed, satellite, map, study, of, a, few, archaeological, sites, in, the, baluchistan, and, khybar, pakhtunkhwa, regions, also, suggests, similarities, in, early, phases, of, farming, with, sites, in, western, asia, pottery, prepared, by, sequential, slab, construction, circular, fire, pits, filled, with, burnt, pebbles, and, large, granaries, are, common, to, both, mehrgarh, and, many, mesopotamian, sites, the, postures, of, the, skeletal, remains, in, graves, at, mehrgarh, bear, strong, resemblance, to, those, at, ali, kosh, in, the, zagros, mountains, of, southern, iran, despite, their, scarcity, the, carbon, 14, and, archaeological, age, determinations, for, early, neolithic, sites, in, southern, asia, exhibit, remarkable, continuity, across, the, vast, region, from, the, near, east, to, the, indian, subcontinent, consistent, with, a, systematic, eastward, spread, at, a, speed, of, about, 0, 65, km, yr, agriculture, in, neolithic, china, can, be, separated, into, two, broad, regions, northern, china, and, southern, china, the, agricultural, centre, in, northern, china, is, believed, to, be, the, homelands, of, the, early, sino, tibetan, speakers, associated, with, the, houli, peiligang, cishan, and, xinglongwa, cultures, clustered, around, the, yellow, river, basin, it, was, the, domestication, centre, for, foxtail, millet, setaria, italica, and, broomcorn, millet, panicum, miliaceum, with, early, evidence, of, domestication, approximately, 8, 000, years, ago, and, widespread, cultivation, 7, 500, years, ago, soybean, was, also, domesticated, in, northern, china, 4, 500, years, ago, orange, and, peach, also, originated, in, china, being, cultivated, c, 2500, bce, the, agricultural, centres, in, southern, china, are, clustered, around, the, yangtze, river, basin, rice, was, domesticated, in, this, region, together, with, the, development, of, paddy, field, cultivation, between, 13, 500, and, 8, 200, years, ago, there, are, two, possible, centres, of, domestication, for, rice, the, first, is, in, the, lower, yangtze, river, believed, to, be, the, homelands, of, pre, austronesians, and, associated, with, the, kauhuqiao, hemudu, majiabang, and, songze, cultures, it, is, characterized, by, typical, pre, austronesian, features, including, stilt, houses, jade, carving, and, boat, technologies, their, diet, were, also, supplemented, by, acorns, water, chestnuts, foxnuts, and, pig, domestication, the, second, is, in, the, middle, yangtze, river, believed, to, be, the, homelands, of, the, early, hmong, mien, speakers, and, associated, with, the, pengtoushan, and, daxi, cultures, both, of, these, regions, were, heavily, populated, and, had, regular, trade, contacts, with, each, other, as, well, as, with, early, austroasiatic, speakers, to, the, west, and, early, kra, dai, speakers, to, the, south, facilitating, the, spread, of, rice, cultivation, throughout, southern, china, the, millet, and, rice, farming, cultures, also, first, came, into, contact, with, each, other, at, around, 9, 000, to, 7, 000, bp, resulting, in, a, corridor, between, the, millet, and, rice, cultivation, centres, where, both, rice, and, millet, were, cultivated, at, around, 5, 500, to, 4, 000, bp, there, was, increasing, migration, into, taiwan, from, the, early, austronesian, dapenkeng, culture, bringing, rice, and, millet, cultivation, technology, with, them, during, this, period, there, is, evidence, of, large, settlements, and, intensive, rice, cultivation, in, taiwan, and, the, penghu, islands, which, may, have, resulted, in, overexploitation, bellwood, 2011, proposes, that, this, may, have, been, the, impetus, of, the, austronesian, expansion, which, started, with, the, migration, of, the, austronesian, speakers, from, taiwan, to, the, philippines, at, around, 5, 000, bp, austronesians, carried, rice, cultivation, technology, to, island, southeast, asia, along, with, other, domesticated, species, the, new, tropical, island, environments, also, had, new, food, plants, that, they, exploited, they, carried, useful, plants, and, animals, during, each, colonization, voyage, resulting, in, the, rapid, introduction, of, domesticated, and, semi, domesticated, species, throughout, oceania, they, also, came, into, contact, with, the, early, agricultural, centres, of, papuan, speaking, populations, of, new, guinea, as, well, as, the, dravidian, speaking, regions, of, south, india, and, sri, lanka, by, around, 3, 500, bp, they, acquired, further, cultivated, food, plants, like, bananas, and, pepper, from, them, and, in, turn, introduced, austronesian, technologies, like, wetland, cultivation, and, outrigger, canoes, during, the, 1st, millennium, ce, they, also, colonized, madagascar, and, the, comoros, bringing, southeast, asian, food, plants, including, rice, to, east, africa, on, the, african, continent, three, areas, have, been, identified, as, independently, developing, agriculture, the, ethiopian, highlands, the, sahel, and, west, africa, by, contrast, agriculture, in, the, nile, river, valley, is, thought, to, have, developed, from, the, original, neolithic, revolution, in, the, fertile, crescent, many, grinding, stones, are, found, with, the, early, egyptian, sebilian, and, mechian, cultures, and, evidence, has, been, found, of, a, neolithic, domesticated, crop, based, economy, dating, around, 7, 000, bp, unlike, the, middle, east, this, evidence, appears, as, a, false, dawn, to, agriculture, as, the, sites, were, later, abandoned, and, permanent, farming, then, was, delayed, until, 6, 500, bp, with, the, tasian, culture, and, badarian, culture, and, the, arrival, of, crops, and, animals, from, the, near, east, bananas, and, plantains, which, were, first, domesticated, in, southeast, asia, most, likely, papua, new, guinea, were, re, domesticated, in, africa, possibly, as, early, as, 5, 000, years, ago, asian, yams, and, taro, were, also, cultivated, in, africa, the, most, famous, crop, domesticated, in, the, ethiopian, highlands, is, coffee, in, addition, khat, ensete, noog, teff, and, finger, millet, were, also, domesticated, in, the, ethiopian, highlands, crops, domesticated, in, the, sahel, region, include, sorghum, and, pearl, millet, the, kola, nut, was, first, domesticated, in, west, africa, other, crops, domesticated, in, west, africa, include, african, rice, yams, and, the, oil, palm, agriculture, spread, to, central, and, southern, africa, in, the, bantu, expansion, during, the, 1st, millennium, bce, to, 1st, millennium, ce, the, term, neolithic, is, not, customarily, used, in, describing, cultures, in, the, americas, however, a, broad, similarity, exists, between, eastern, hemisphere, cultures, of, the, neolithic, and, cultures, in, the, americas, maize, corn, beans, and, squash, were, among, the, earliest, crops, domesticated, in, mesoamerica, squash, as, early, as, 6000, bce, beans, no, later, than, 4000, bce, and, maize, beginning, about, 7000, bce, potatoes, and, manioc, were, domesticated, in, south, america, in, what, is, now, the, eastern, united, states, native, americans, domesticated, sunflower, sumpweed, and, goosefoot, c, 2500, bce, in, the, highlands, of, central, mexico, sedentary, village, life, based, on, farming, did, not, develop, until, the, formative, period, in, the, second, millennium, bce, evidence, of, drainage, ditches, at, kuk, swamp, on, the, borders, of, the, western, and, southern, highlands, of, papua, new, guinea, indicates, cultivation, of, taro, and, a, variety, of, other, crops, dating, back, to, 11, 000, bp, two, potentially, significant, economic, species, taro, colocasia, esculenta, and, yam, dioscorea, sp, have, been, identified, dating, at, least, to, 10, 200, calibrated, years, before, present, cal, bp, further, evidence, of, bananas, and, sugarcane, dates, to, 6, 950, to, 6, 440, bce, this, was, at, the, altitudinal, limits, of, these, crops, and, it, has, been, suggested, that, cultivation, in, more, favourable, ranges, in, the, lowlands, may, have, been, even, earlier, csiro, has, found, evidence, that, taro, was, introduced, into, the, solomon, islands, for, human, use, from, 28, 000, years, ago, making, taro, the, earliest, cultivated, crop, in, the, world, it, seems, to, have, resulted, in, the, spread, of, the, trans, new, guinea, languages, from, new, guinea, east, into, the, solomon, islands, and, west, into, timor, and, adjacent, areas, of, indonesia, this, seems, to, confirm, the, theories, of, carl, sauer, who, in, agricultural, origins, and, dispersals, suggested, as, early, as, 1952, that, this, region, was, a, centre, of, early, agriculture, when, hunter, gathering, began, to, be, replaced, by, sedentary, food, production, it, became, more, efficient, to, keep, animals, close, at, hand, therefore, it, became, necessary, to, bring, animals, permanently, to, their, settlements, although, in, many, cases, there, was, a, distinction, between, relatively, sedentary, farmers, and, nomadic, herders, the, animals, size, temperament, diet, mating, patterns, and, life, span, were, factors, in, the, desire, and, success, in, domesticating, animals, animals, that, provided, milk, such, as, cows, and, goats, offered, a, source, of, protein, that, was, renewable, and, therefore, quite, valuable, the, animal, s, ability, as, a, worker, for, example, ploughing, or, towing, as, well, as, a, food, source, also, had, to, be, taken, into, account, besides, being, a, direct, source, of, food, certain, animals, could, provide, leather, wool, hides, and, fertilizer, some, of, the, earliest, domesticated, animals, included, dogs, east, asia, about, 15, 000, years, ago, sheep, goats, cows, and, pigs, the, middle, east, served, as, the, source, for, many, animals, that, could, be, domesticated, such, as, sheep, goats, and, pigs, this, area, was, also, the, first, region, to, domesticate, the, dromedary, henri, fleisch, discovered, and, termed, the, shepherd, neolithic, flint, industry, from, the, bekaa, valley, in, lebanon, and, suggested, that, it, could, have, been, used, by, the, earliest, nomadic, shepherds, he, dated, this, industry, to, the, epipaleolithic, or, pre, pottery, neolithic, as, it, is, evidently, not, paleolithic, mesolithic, or, even, pottery, neolithic, the, presence, of, these, animals, gave, the, region, a, large, advantage, in, cultural, and, economic, development, as, the, climate, in, the, middle, east, changed, and, became, drier, many, of, the, farmers, were, forced, to, leave, taking, their, domesticated, animals, with, them, it, was, this, massive, emigration, from, the, middle, east, that, later, helped, distribute, these, animals, to, the, rest, of, afroeurasia, this, emigration, was, mainly, on, an, east, west, axis, of, similar, climates, as, crops, usually, have, a, narrow, optimal, climatic, range, outside, of, which, they, cannot, grow, for, reasons, of, light, or, rain, changes, for, instance, wheat, does, not, normally, grow, in, tropical, climates, just, like, tropical, crops, such, as, bananas, do, not, grow, in, colder, climates, some, authors, like, jared, diamond, have, postulated, that, this, east, west, axis, is, the, main, reason, why, plant, and, animal, domestication, spread, so, quickly, from, the, fertile, crescent, to, the, rest, of, eurasia, and, north, africa, while, it, did, not, reach, through, the, north, south, axis, of, africa, to, reach, the, mediterranean, climates, of, south, africa, where, temperate, crops, were, successfully, imported, by, ships, in, the, last, 500, years, similarly, the, african, zebu, of, central, africa, and, the, domesticated, bovines, of, the, fertile, crescent, separated, by, the, dry, sahara, desert, were, not, introduced, into, each, other, s, region, despite, the, significant, technological, advance, and, advancements, in, knowledge, arts, and, trade, the, neolithic, revolution, did, not, lead, immediately, to, a, rapid, growth, of, population, its, benefits, appear, to, have, been, offset, by, various, adverse, effects, mostly, diseases, and, warfare, the, introduction, of, agriculture, has, not, necessarily, led, to, unequivocal, progress, the, nutritional, standards, of, the, growing, neolithic, populations, were, inferior, to, that, of, hunter, gatherers, several, ethnological, and, archaeological, studies, conclude, that, the, transition, to, cereal, based, diets, caused, a, reduction, in, life, expectancy, and, stature, an, increase, in, infant, mortality, and, infectious, diseases, the, development, of, chronic, inflammatory, or, degenerative, diseases, such, as, obesity, type, 2, diabetes, and, cardiovascular, diseases, and, multiple, nutritional, deficiencies, including, vitamin, deficiencies, iron, deficiency, anemia, and, mineral, disorders, affecting, bones, such, as, osteoporosis, and, rickets, and, teeth, average, height, for, europeans, went, down, from, 5, 10, 178, cm, for, men, and, 5, 6, 168, cm, for, women, to, 5, 5, 165, cm, and, 5, 1, 155, cm, respectively, and, it, took, until, the, twentieth, century, for, average, height, for, europeans, to, return, to, the, pre, neolithic, revolution, levels, the, traditional, view, is, that, agricultural, food, production, supported, a, denser, population, which, in, turn, supported, larger, sedentary, communities, the, accumulation, of, goods, and, tools, and, specialization, in, diverse, forms, of, new, labor, food, surpluses, made, possible, the, development, of, a, social, elite, who, were, not, otherwise, engaged, in, agriculture, industry, or, commerce, but, dominated, their, communities, by, other, means, and, monopolized, decision, making, nonetheless, larger, societies, made, it, more, feasible, for, people, to, adopt, diverse, decision, making, and, governance, models, jared, diamond, in, the, world, until, yesterday, identifies, the, availability, of, milk, and, cereal, grains, as, permitting, mothers, to, raise, both, an, older, e, g, 3, or, 4, year, old, and, a, younger, child, concurrently, the, result, is, that, a, population, can, increase, more, rapidly, diamond, in, agreement, with, feminist, scholars, such, as, v, spike, peterson, points, out, that, agriculture, brought, about, deep, social, divisions, and, encouraged, gender, inequality, this, social, reshuffle, is, traced, by, historical, theorists, like, veronica, strang, through, developments, in, theological, depictions, strang, supports, her, theory, through, a, comparison, of, aquatic, deities, before, and, after, the, neolithic, agricultural, revolution, most, notably, the, venus, of, lespugue, and, the, greco, roman, deities, such, as, circe, or, charybdis, the, former, venerated, and, respected, the, latter, dominated, and, conquered, the, theory, supplemented, by, the, widely, accepted, assumption, from, parsons, that, society, is, always, the, object, of, religious, veneration, argues, that, with, the, centralization, of, government, and, the, dawn, of, the, anthropocene, roles, within, society, became, more, restrictive, and, were, rationalized, through, the, conditioning, effect, of, religion, a, process, that, is, crystallized, in, the, progression, from, polytheism, to, monotheism, andrew, sherratt, has, argued, that, following, upon, the, neolithic, revolution, was, a, second, phase, of, discovery, that, he, refers, to, as, the, secondary, products, revolution, animals, it, appears, were, first, domesticated, purely, as, a, source, of, meat, the, secondary, products, revolution, occurred, when, it, was, recognised, that, animals, also, provided, a, number, of, other, useful, products, these, included, sherratt, argued, that, this, phase, in, agricultural, development, enabled, humans, to, make, use, of, the, energy, possibilities, of, their, animals, in, new, ways, and, permitted, permanent, intensive, subsistence, farming, and, crop, production, and, the, opening, up, of, heavier, soils, for, farming, it, also, made, possible, nomadic, pastoralism, in, semi, arid, areas, along, the, margins, of, deserts, and, eventually, led, to, the, domestication, of, both, the, dromedary, and, bactrian, camel, overgrazing, of, these, areas, particularly, by, herds, of, goats, greatly, extended, the, areal, extent, of, deserts, compared, to, foragers, neolithic, farmers, diets, were, higher, in, carbohydrates, but, lower, in, fibre, micronutrients, and, protein, this, led, to, an, increase, in, the, frequency, of, carious, teeth, and, slower, growth, in, childhood, and, increased, body, fat, and, studies, have, consistently, found, that, populations, around, the, world, became, shorter, after, the, transition, to, agriculture, this, trend, may, have, been, exacerbated, by, the, greater, seasonality, of, farming, diets, and, with, it, the, increased, risk, of, famine, due, to, crop, failure, throughout, the, development, of, sedentary, societies, disease, spread, more, rapidly, than, it, had, during, the, time, in, which, hunter, gatherer, societies, existed, inadequate, sanitary, practices, and, the, domestication, of, animals, may, explain, the, rise, in, deaths, and, sickness, following, the, neolithic, revolution, as, diseases, jumped, from, the, animal, to, the, human, population, some, examples, of, infectious, diseases, spread, from, animals, to, humans, are, influenza, smallpox, and, measles, ancient, microbial, genomics, has, shown, that, progenitors, to, human, adapted, strains, of, salmonella, enterica, infected, up, to, 5, 500, year, old, agro, pastoralists, throughout, western, eurasia, providing, molecular, evidence, for, the, hypothesis, that, the, neolithization, process, facilitated, the, emergence, of, salmonella, entericia, in, concordance, with, a, process, of, natural, selection, the, humans, who, first, domesticated, the, big, mammals, quickly, built, up, immunities, to, the, diseases, as, within, each, generation, the, individuals, with, better, immunities, had, better, chances, of, survival, in, their, approximately, 10, 000, years, of, shared, proximity, with, animals, such, as, cows, eurasians, and, africans, became, more, resistant, to, those, diseases, compared, with, the, indigenous, populations, encountered, outside, eurasia, and, africa, for, instance, the, population, of, most, caribbean, and, several, pacific, islands, have, been, completely, wiped, out, by, diseases, 90, or, more, of, many, populations, of, the, americas, were, wiped, out, by, european, and, african, diseases, before, recorded, contact, with, european, explorers, or, colonists, some, cultures, like, the, inca, empire, did, have, a, large, domestic, mammal, the, llama, but, llama, milk, was, not, drunk, nor, did, llamas, live, in, a, closed, space, with, humans, so, the, risk, of, contagion, was, limited, according, to, bioarchaeological, research, the, effects, of, agriculture, on, dental, health, in, southeast, asian, rice, farming, societies, from, 4000, to, 1500, bp, was, not, detrimental, to, the, same, extent, as, in, other, world, regions, jonathan, c, k, wells, and, jay, t, stock, have, argued, that, the, dietary, changes, and, increased, pathogen, exposure, associated, with, agriculture, profoundly, altered, human, biology, and, life, history, creating, conditions, where, natural, selection, favoured, the, allocation, of, resources, towards, reproduction, over, somatic, effort, the, dispersal, of, neolithic, culture, from, the, middle, east, has, recently, been, associated, with, the, distribution, of, human, genetic, markers, in, europe, the, spread, of, the, neolithic, culture, has, been, associated, with, distribution, of, the, e1b1b, lineages, and, haplogroup, j, that, are, thought, to, have, arrived, in, europe, from, north, africa, and, the, near, east, respectively, dna, studies, have, shown, that, agriculture, was, introduced, in, europe, by, the, expansion, of, the, early, farmers, from, anatolia, about, 9, 000, years, ago
