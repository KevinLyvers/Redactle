troy, ancient, greek, romanized, tro, latin, tr, ia, hittite, romanized, truwi, a, tarui, a, or, ilion, ancient, greek, romanized, lion, hittite, romanized, wilu, a, was, an, ancient, city, located, in, present, day, hisarl, k, turkey, the, place, was, first, settled, around, 3600, bc, and, grew, into, a, small, fortified, city, around, 3000, bc, during, its, four, thousand, years, of, existence, troy, was, repeatedly, destroyed, and, rebuilt, as, a, result, the, archeological, site, that, has, been, left, is, divided, into, nine, layers, each, corresponding, to, a, city, built, on, the, ruins, of, the, previous, archaeologists, refer, to, these, layers, using, roman, numerals, among, the, early, layers, troy, ii, is, notable, for, its, wealth, and, imposing, architecture, during, the, late, bronze, age, troy, was, called, wilusa, and, was, a, vassal, of, the, hittite, empire, the, final, layers, troy, viii, ix, were, greek, and, roman, cities, which, in, their, days, served, as, tourist, attractions, and, religious, centers, because, of, their, link, to, mythic, tradition, the, archaeological, site, is, open, to, the, public, as, a, tourist, destination, and, was, added, to, the, unesco, world, heritage, list, in, 1998, the, site, was, excavated, by, heinrich, schliemann, and, frank, calvert, starting, in, 1871, under, the, ruins, of, the, classical, city, they, found, the, remains, of, numerous, earlier, settlements, several, of, these, layers, resemble, literary, depictions, of, troy, leading, some, scholars, to, conclude, that, there, is, a, kernel, of, truth, underlying, the, legends, subsequent, excavations, by, others, have, added, to, the, modern, understanding, of, the, site, though, the, exact, relationship, between, myth, and, reality, remains, unclear, and, there, is, no, definitive, evidence, for, a, greek, attack, on, the, city, ppxiv, 180, 182, in, classical, greek, the, city, was, referred, to, as, both, troia, and, ilion, or, ilios, metrical, evidence, from, the, iliad, and, the, odyssey, suggests, that, the, latter, was, originally, pronounced, wilios, these, names, seem, to, date, back, to, the, bronze, age, as, suggested, by, hittite, records, which, refer, to, a, city, in, northwest, anatolia, called, wilusa, or, truwisa, which, is, generally, identified, with, the, site, of, hisarl, k, in, greek, myth, these, names, were, held, to, originate, from, the, names, of, the, kingdom, s, founders, tros, and, his, son, ilus, in, latin, the, city, was, referred, to, as, troia, or, ilium, in, turkish, it, is, generally, known, as, troya, or, truva, the, archaeological, site, of, troy, consists, of, the, hill, of, hisarl, k, and, the, fields, below, it, to, the, south, the, hill, is, a, tell, composed, of, strata, containing, the, remains, left, behind, by, more, than, three, millennia, of, human, occupation, the, primary, divisions, among, layers, are, designated, with, roman, numerals, troy, i, representing, the, oldest, layer, and, troy, ix, representing, the, most, recent, sublayers, are, distinguished, with, lowercase, letters, e, g, viia, and, viib, and, further, subdivisions, with, numbers, e, g, viib1, and, viib2, an, additional, major, layer, known, as, troy, 0, predates, the, layers, which, were, initially, given, roman, numeral, designations, the, layers, have, been, given, relative, dates, by, comparing, artifacts, found, in, them, to, those, found, at, other, sites, however, precise, absolute, dates, are, not, always, possible, due, to, limitations, in, the, accuracy, of, c, 14, dating, troy, 0, is, a, pre, bronze, age, layer, known, from, limited, finds, of, pottery, shards, and, wooden, beams, it, is, tentatively, dated, to, c, 3600, 3500, bc, but, little, is, known, about, it, troy, i, was, founded, around, 3000, bc, on, what, was, then, the, eastern, shore, of, a, shallow, lagoon, it, was, significantly, smaller, than, later, settlements, at, the, site, with, a, citadel, covering, less, than, 1, ha, however, it, stood, out, from, its, neighbours, in, particular, for, its, massive, limestone, fortifications, which, were, regularly, renovated, and, strengthened, defensive, architecture, would, continue, to, be, a, distinctive, characteristic, in, later, periods, reflecting, perennial, security, concerns, at, the, vulnerable, coastal, site, pp9, 12, residents, lived, in, attached, houses, made, of, stone, and, mudbrick, some, houses, had, a, megaron, layout, among, which, one, room, is, notably, larger, than, the, others, although, the, city, plan, is, not, entirely, clear, from, its, limited, remains, the, houses, appear, to, have, been, oriented, in, parallel, to, the, southern, walls, artifacts, from, this, era, include, dark, colored, handmade, pottery, objects, made, of, copper, as, well, as, a, monumental, stone, stele, with, a, relief, depicting, an, armed, warrior, troy, i, was, founded, as, part, of, a, consolidation, of, settlement, in, the, area, its, founders, came, from, nearby, towns, such, as, kumtepe, and, g, lp, nar, which, had, been, part, of, an, earlier, network, that, had, cultural, and, economic, ties, to, the, eastern, aegean, and, southeastern, europe, troy, itself, appears, to, have, maintained, these, connections, showing, similarities, to, sites, in, thessaly, and, southeastern, europe, as, well, as, aegean, sites, such, as, poliochni, in, lemnos, and, thermi, in, lesbos, despite, some, connections, to, anatolian, sites, including, badema, ac, it, did, not, yet, have, the, close, ties, with, central, anatolia, seen, later, troy, i, was, destroyed, by, fire, around, 2550, bc, troy, ii, was, built, around, 2550, bc, although, there, is, no, evidence, of, a, cultural, break, after, the, previous, settlement, the, new, city, had, a, very, different, character, it, was, twice, the, size, of, the, preceding, city, featuring, a, lower, town, as, well, as, an, expanded, citadel, divided, into, two, precincts, these, precincts, divided, by, colonnades, suggest, growing, socio, political, stratification, in, trojan, society, at, the, center, were, large, megaron, style, buildings, around, a, courtyard, which, was, likely, used, for, public, events, one, of, these, buildings, megaron, iia, is, the, biggest, known, building, of, its, kind, in, the, aegean, anatolian, region, pp11, 19, the, citadel, was, protected, by, massive, stone, walls, and, towers, topped, with, mudbrick, superstructures, it, was, accessed, through, two, ramps, one, of, which, is, well, preserved, and, attracts, attention, from, modern, day, tourists, because, the, city, was, not, large, enough, to, require, two, gates, for, practical, purposes, some, archaeologists, have, speculated, that, one, of, the, gates, was, intended, for, ceremonial, processions, the, lower, city, was, protected, by, a, wooden, palisade, unlike, any, other, known, in, that, era, it, was, a, complex, structure, nearly, 3, meters, wide, with, interior, buttresses, and, columns, and, beams, secured, in, notches, cut, into, the, bedrock, pp11, 19, wheel, made, pottery, appears, at, the, site, for, the, first, time, along, with, caches, of, treasures, that, attest, to, trojan, participation, in, networks, of, aristocratic, competition, these, items, were, made, from, amber, imported, from, the, baltic, region, carnelian, imported, from, india, and, lapis, imported, from, afghanistan, some, of, these, items, are, strikingly, similar, to, those, found, at, sites, such, as, poliochni, and, ur, leading, some, scholars, to, speculate, that, they, may, have, been, made, by, itinerant, jewelers, who, worked, routes, covering, much, of, the, ancient, near, east, pp11, 19, troy, ii, was, destroyed, twice, after, the, first, destruction, the, citadel, was, rebuilt, with, a, dense, cluster, of, small, houses, on, an, irregular, plan, the, final, destruction, took, place, around, 2300, bc, while, some, scholars, have, linked, this, destruction, to, a, broader, crisis, that, affected, other, near, eastern, sites, there, is, no, definitive, evidence, for, the, city, having, been, destroyed, by, an, attack, troy, ii, is, notable, for, having, been, misidentified, as, homeric, troy, during, initial, excavations, because, of, its, massive, architecture, treasure, hoards, and, catastrophic, destruction, in, particular, schliemann, saw, homer, s, description, of, troy, s, scaean, gate, reflected, in, troy, ii, s, imposing, western, gate, however, later, excavations, demonstrated, that, the, site, was, a, thousand, years, too, old, to, have, coexisted, with, mycenaean, greeks, troy, continued, to, be, occupied, between, 2300, bc, and, 1750, bc, however, little, is, known, about, these, several, layers, due, to, schliemann, s, careless, excavation, practices, in, order, to, fully, excavate, the, citadel, of, troy, ii, he, destroyed, most, remains, from, this, period, without, first, documenting, them, these, settlements, appear, to, have, been, smaller, and, poorer, than, previous, ones, though, this, interpretation, could, be, merely, the, result, of, gaps, in, the, surviving, evidence, the, settlements, included, a, dense, residential, neighborhood, in, the, citadel, walls, from, troy, ii, may, have, been, reused, as, part, of, troy, iii, by, the, period, of, troy, v, the, city, had, once, again, expanded, outside, the, citadel, to, the, west, troy, iv, sees, the, introduction, of, domed, ovens, in, troy, v, artifacts, include, anatolian, style, red, cross, bowls, as, well, as, imported, minoan, objects, they, would, trade, with, other, cities, around, them, troy, vi, vii, was, a, major, late, bronze, age, city, consisting, of, a, steep, fortified, citadel, and, a, sprawling, lower, town, below, it, it, was, a, thriving, coastal, city, with, a, considerable, population, equal, in, size, to, second, tier, hittite, settlements, it, had, a, distinct, northwest, anatolian, culture, and, extensive, foreign, contacts, including, with, mycenaean, greece, and, its, position, at, the, mouth, of, the, dardanelles, has, been, argued, to, have, given, it, the, function, of, regional, capital, its, status, protected, by, treaties, aspects, of, its, architecture, are, consistent, with, the, iliad, s, description, of, mythic, troy, and, several, of, its, sublayers, vih, and, viia, show, potential, signs, of, violent, destruction, thus, these, sublayers, are, among, the, candidates, for, a, potential, historical, setting, of, those, myths, p59, troy, vi, and, vii, were, given, separate, labels, by, early, excavators, but, current, research, has, shown, that, the, first, several, sublayers, of, troy, vii, were, in, fact, continuations, of, the, earlier, city, although, some, scholars, have, proposed, revising, the, nomenclature, to, reflect, this, consensus, the, original, terms, are, typically, used, to, avoid, confusion, p198, troy, vi, existed, from, around, 1750, bc, to, 1300, bc, its, citadel, was, divided, into, a, series, of, rising, terraces, of, which, only, the, outermost, is, reasonably, well, preserved, on, this, terrace, archaeologists, have, found, the, remains, of, freestanding, multistory, houses, where, trojan, elites, would, have, lived, these, houses, lacked, ground, floor, windows, and, their, stone, exterior, walls, mirrored, the, architecture, of, the, citadel, fortifications, however, they, otherwise, display, an, eclectic, mix, of, architectural, styles, some, following, the, classic, megaron, design, others, even, having, irregular, floorplans, some, of, these, houses, show, potential, aegean, influence, one, in, particular, resembling, the, megaron, at, midea, in, the, argolid, archaeologists, believe, there, may, have, been, a, royal, palace, on, the, highest, terrace, but, most, bronze, age, remains, from, the, top, of, the, hill, were, cleared, away, by, classical, era, building, projects, pp, 58, 59, pp20, 24, the, citadel, was, enclosed, by, a, massive, wall, whose, limestone, base, is, visible, to, modern, day, visitors, these, walls, were, periodically, renovated, expanding, from, an, initial, width, of, 1, 2, to, 5, metres, 3, 9, to, 16, 4, ft, around, 1400, bc, during, the, bronze, age, they, would, have, been, overlaid, with, wood, and, mudbrick, superstructures, reaching, a, height, over, 9, metres, 30, ft, the, walls, were, built, in, a, sawtooth, style, made, of, 7, 10, metres, 23, 33, ft, segments, which, joined, at, shallow, angles, this, characteristic, is, common, in, the, walls, of, mycenaean, citadels, though, at, troy, it, is, also, found, in, other, buildings, suggesting, that, it, may, have, been, decorative, the, walls, also, have, a, notable, slope, similar, to, those, at, other, sites, including, hattusa, however, the, walls, differ, from, contemporary, aegean, and, anatolian, sites, both, in, their, lack, of, figural, sculpture, and, in, their, masonry, while, troy, vi, s, walls, were, made, entirely, of, close, fitting, ashlars, contemporary, sites, typically, used, ashlars, around, a, rubble, core, pp, 58, 59, pp20, 21, troy, vi, s, walls, were, overlooked, by, several, rectangular, watchtowers, which, would, also, have, provided, a, clear, view, of, trojan, plain, and, the, sea, beyond, it, the, citadel, was, accessed, by, five, gates, which, led, into, paved, and, drained, cobblestone, streets, some, of, these, gates, featured, enormous, pillars, which, serve, no, structural, purpose, and, have, been, interpreted, as, religious, symbols, the, halls, were, built, in, megaron, style, resembling, mycenaean, architecture, pp, 58, 59, pp20, 21, 24, the, lower, town, was, built, to, the, south, of, the, citadel, covering, an, area, of, roughly, 30, hectares, remains, of, a, dense, neighborhood, have, been, found, just, outside, the, citadel, walls, and, traces, of, bronze, age, occupation, have, been, found, further, away, these, include, huts, stone, paving, threshing, floors, pithoi, and, waste, left, behind, by, bronze, age, industry, such, as, murex, shells, associated, with, the, manufacture, of, purple, dye, the, extent, of, the, lower, town, is, evidenced, by, a, defensive, ditch, cut, 1, 2, into, the, bedrock, a, wall, or, palisade, may, have, stood, several, meters, behind, the, ditch, as, in, the, outer, defenses, of, other, cities, such, as, qadesh, and, carchemish, however, material, evidence, for, such, a, wall, is, limited, to, postholes, and, cuts, in, the, bedrock, pp22, 23, the, lower, city, was, only, discovered, in, the, late, 1980s, earlier, excavators, having, assumed, that, troy, vi, occupied, only, the, hill, of, hisarl, k, its, discovery, led, to, a, dramatic, reassessment, of, troy, vi, showing, that, it, was, over, 16, times, larger, than, had, been, assumed, and, thus, a, major, city, with, a, large, population, rather, than, a, mere, aristocratic, residence, however, only, 2, 3, of, the, lower, city, had, been, excavated, as, of, 2013, and, few, architectural, features, are, likely, to, exist, almost, 2m, of, the, surface, has, eroded, likely, removing, much, of, the, evidence, that, hadn, t, already, decomposed, been, built, over, or, reused, in, later, construction, pp, 61, 64, pp22, 23, the, material, culture, of, troy, vi, appears, to, belong, to, a, distinct, northwest, anatolian, cultural, group, with, influences, from, the, aegean, and, the, balkans, the, primary, local, pottery, styles, were, wheel, made, tan, ware, and, anatolian, gray, ware, both, styles, were, offshoots, of, an, earlier, middle, helladic, tradition, related, to, minyan, ware, the, earliest, gray, ware, at, troy, was, made, in, aegean, shapes, though, by, 1700, bc, it, had, been, replaced, by, anatolian, shapes, foreign, pottery, found, at, the, site, includes, minoan, mycenaean, cypriot, and, levantine, items, local, potters, also, made, their, own, imitations, of, foreign, styles, including, gray, ware, and, tan, ware, pots, made, in, mycenaean, style, shapes, particularly, after, 1500, bc, although, the, city, appears, to, have, been, within, the, hittite, sphere, of, influence, no, hittite, artifacts, have, been, found, in, troy, vi, also, notably, absent, are, sculptures, and, wall, paintings, otherwise, common, features, of, bronze, age, cities, troy, vi, is, also, notable, for, its, architectural, innovations, as, well, as, its, cultural, developments, which, included, the, first, evidence, of, horses, at, the, site, pp25, the, language, spoken, in, troy, vi, is, unknown, one, candidate, is, luwian, an, anatolian, language, believed, to, have, been, spoken, in, the, general, area, potential, evidence, comes, from, a, biconvex, seal, inscribed, with, the, name, of, a, person, using, anatolian, hieroglyphs, often, used, to, write, luwian, however, available, evidence, is, not, sufficient, to, establish, that, luwian, was, actually, spoken, by, the, city, s, population, and, a, number, of, alternatives, such, as, greek, and, lemnian, etruscan, have, been, proposed, hittite, documents, found, at, hattusa, suggest, that, literacy, existed, at, troy, and, that, the, city, may, have, had, a, written, archive, the, alaksandu, treaty, required, king, alaksandu, to, read, its, text, publicly, three, times, a, year, while, the, milawata, letter, mentions, that, the, deposed, king, walmu, was, still, in, possession, of, wooden, investiture, tablets, the, archive, would, likely, have, been, housed, in, the, citadel, s, innermost, precinct, whose, remains, were, pushed, over, the, northern, side, of, the, hill, during, 3rd, century, construction, despite, attempts, to, sift, through, the, rubble, no, documents, have, been, found, pp, 117, 122, pp34, 35, troy, vi, was, destroyed, around, 1300, bc, corresponding, with, the, sublayer, known, as, troy, vih, damage, in, the, troy, vih, layer, includes, extensive, collapsed, masonry, and, subsidence, in, the, southeast, of, the, citadel, indicative, of, an, earthquake, alternative, hypotheses, include, an, internal, uprising, as, well, as, a, foreign, attack, though, the, city, was, not, burned, and, no, victims, were, found, in, the, debris, pp, 64, 66, p30, troy, viia, was, the, final, layer, of, the, late, bronze, age, city, it, was, built, soon, after, the, destruction, of, troy, vi, seemingly, by, its, previous, inhabitants, the, builders, reused, many, of, the, earlier, city, s, surviving, structures, notably, its, citadel, wall, which, they, renovated, with, additional, stone, towers, and, mudbrick, breastworks, numerous, small, houses, were, added, inside, the, citadel, filling, in, formerly, open, areas, new, houses, were, also, built, in, the, lower, city, whose, area, appears, to, have, been, greater, in, troy, viia, than, in, troy, vi, in, many, of, these, houses, archaeologists, found, enormous, storage, jars, called, pithoi, buried, in, the, ground, troy, viia, seems, to, have, been, built, by, survivors, of, troy, vi, s, destruction, as, evidenced, by, continuity, in, material, culture, however, the, character, of, the, city, appears, to, have, changed, the, citadel, growing, crowded, and, foreign, imports, declining, p, 59, the, city, was, destroyed, around, 1180, bc, roughly, contemporary, with, the, late, bronze, age, collapse, but, subsequent, to, the, destruction, of, the, mycenaean, palaces, the, destruction, layer, shows, evidence, of, enemy, attack, including, scorch, marks, p, 59, after, the, destruction, of, troy, viia, around, 1180, bc, the, city, was, rebuilt, as, troy, viib, older, structures, were, again, reused, including, troy, vi, s, citadel, walls, its, first, phase, troy, viib1, appears, to, be, largely, a, continuation, of, troy, viia, residents, continued, using, wheel, made, grey, ware, pottery, alongside, a, new, handmade, style, sometimes, known, as, barbarian, ware, imported, mycenaean, style, pottery, attests, to, some, continuing, foreign, trade, however, the, city, s, population, appears, to, have, dropped, and, rebuilding, seems, to, be, confined, to, the, citadel, pp, 66, 67, one, of, the, most, striking, finds, from, troy, viib1, is, a, bronze, biconvex, hieroglyphic, luwian, seal, giving, the, name, of, a, woman, on, one, side, and, the, name, of, a, man, who, worked, as, a, scribe, on, the, other, the, seal, is, important, since, it, is, the, only, example, of, preclassical, writing, found, at, the, site, and, provides, potential, evidence, that, troy, viib1, had, a, luwian, speaking, population, however, the, find, is, puzzling, since, palace, bureaucracies, had, largely, disappeared, by, this, era, proposed, explanations, include, the, possibility, that, it, belonged, to, an, itinerant, freelance, scribe, and, alternatively, that, it, dates, from, an, earlier, era, than, its, find, context, would, suggest, p, 118, troy, viib2, is, marked, by, dramatic, cultural, changes, including, walls, made, of, upright, stones, and, a, handmade, knobbed, pottery, style, known, as, buckelkeramik, these, practices, which, existed, alongside, older, local, traditions, have, been, argued, to, reflect, immigrant, populations, arriving, from, southwest, europe, these, newcomers, may, have, shared, an, origin, with, the, phrygians, who, initiated, similar, cultural, shifts, at, sites, such, as, gordion, this, layer, was, destroyed, around, 1050, bc, after, an, apparent, earthquake, pp, 66, 67, pp38, 40, troy, viib3, dates, from, the, protogeometric, era, no, new, builds, were, constructed, so, its, existence, is, known, primarily, from, artifacts, found, in, the, west, sanctuary, and, terraces, on, south, side, of, mound, these, areas, were, excavated, in, the, 1990s, surprising, the, archaeologists, who, had, assumed, that, the, site, was, abandoned, until, the, archaic, era, locally, made, neck, handled, amphoras, shows, that, troy, still, had, a, pottery, industry, possibly, associated, with, a, wine, or, oil, industry, the, style, of, these, pots, shows, stylistic, similarities, to, other, north, aegean, sites, suggesting, cultural, contact, because, other, artifacts, do, not, show, these, links, archaeologists, believe, that, greek, settlement, of, troy, did, not, begin, until, later, both, the, troy, vi, walls, and, the, troy, viia, terrace, house, were, reused, for, worship, and, communal, feasting, as, evidenced, by, animal, bones, pottery, assemblages, and, traces, of, burned, incense, strikingly, the, terrace, house, was, not, renovated, when, it, was, adopted, as, a, cult, center, and, thus, must, have, been, used, in, a, ruined, state, potentially, suggesting, that, the, occupants, of, troy, viib3, were, deliberately, re, engaging, with, their, past, pp, 66, 67, pp45, 50, troy, viib, was, destroyed, by, fire, around, 950, bc, however, some, houses, in, the, citadel, were, left, intact, and, the, site, continued, to, be, occupied, if, only, sparsely, troy, viii, was, founded, during, the, greek, dark, ages, and, lasted, until, the, roman, era, though, the, site, had, never, been, entirely, abandoned, its, redevelopment, as, a, major, city, was, spurred, by, greek, immigrants, who, began, building, around, 700, bc, during, the, archaic, period, the, city, s, defenses, once, again, included, the, reused, citadel, wall, of, troy, vi, later, on, the, walls, became, tourist, attractions, and, sites, of, worship, other, remains, of, the, bronze, age, city, were, destroyed, by, the, greeks, building, projects, notably, the, peak, of, the, citadel, where, the, troy, vi, palace, is, likely, to, have, stood, by, the, classical, era, the, city, had, numerous, temples, a, theater, among, other, public, buildings, and, was, once, again, expanding, to, the, south, of, the, citadel, troy, viii, was, destroyed, in, 85, bc, and, subsequently, rebuilt, as, troy, ix, a, series, of, earthquakes, devastated, the, city, around, 500, ad, though, finds, from, the, late, byzantine, era, attest, to, continued, habitation, at, a, small, scale, early, modern, travellers, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, including, pierre, belon, and, pietro, della, valle, had, mistakenly, identified, troy, with, alexandria, troas, a, ruined, hellenistic, town, approximately, 20, kilometres, 12, mi, south, of, hisarl, k, in, the, late, 18th, century, jean, baptiste, lechevalier, identified, a, location, near, the, village, of, p, narba, ezine, a, mound, approximately, 5, kilometres, 3, 1, mi, south, of, the, currently, accepted, location, published, in, his, voyage, de, la, troade, it, was, the, most, commonly, proposed, location, for, almost, a, century, in, 1822, the, scottish, journalist, charles, maclaren, was, the, first, to, identify, with, confidence, the, position, of, the, city, as, it, is, now, known, the, first, excavations, at, the, site, were, trenches, by, british, civil, engineer, john, brunton, in, 1855, the, next, excavation, at, hisarl, k, was, conducted, in, 1865, by, frank, calvert, a, turkish, levantine, man, of, english, descent, who, owned, a, farm, nearby, calvert, made, extensive, surveys, of, the, site, and, correctly, identified, it, with, classical, era, ilion, this, identification, convinced, heinrich, schliemann, that, homeric, troy, should, be, sought, beneath, the, classical, era, remains, and, led, to, their, subsequent, partnership, in, 1868, german, businessman, heinrich, schliemann, visited, calvert, and, secured, permission, to, excavate, hisarl, k, at, this, point, in, time, the, mound, was, about, 200, meters, long, and, somewhat, less, than, 150, meters, wide, it, rose, 31, 2, meters, above, the, plain, and, 38, 5, meters, above, sea, level, as, with, calvert, and, others, in, april, 1870, schliemann, began, by, excavating, a, trench, across, the, mound, of, hisarl, k, to, the, depth, of, the, settlements, today, called, schliemann, s, trench, in, 1871, 1873, and, 1878, 1879, 1882, and, 1890, the, later, two, joined, by, wilhelm, d, rpfeld, he, discovered, the, ruins, of, a, series, of, ancient, cities, dating, from, the, bronze, age, to, the, roman, period, schliemann, was, planning, for, another, excavation, season, in, 1891, when, he, died, in, december, 1890, he, proposed, that, the, second, layer, troy, ii, corresponded, to, the, city, of, legend, though, later, research, has, shown, that, it, predated, the, mycenaean, era, by, several, hundred, years, significant, finds, included, many, owl, headed, idols, and, stone, axes, from, the, lower, levels, some, of, the, most, notable, artifacts, found, by, schliemann, are, known, as, priam, s, treasure, after, the, legendary, trojan, king, many, of, these, ended, up, in, the, istanbul, archaeology, museum, almost, all, the, precious, metal, objects, that, went, to, berlin, were, confiscated, by, the, soviet, union, in, 1945, and, are, now, in, pushkin, museum, in, moscow, even, in, his, own, time, schliemann, s, legacy, was, controversial, because, of, his, excavation, methods, which, included, removing, features, he, considered, insignificant, without, first, studying, and, documenting, them, wilhelm, d, rpfeld, 1893, 1894, began, working, the, site, alongside, schliemann, and, later, inherited, excavation, at, the, site, and, published, his, own, independent, work, his, chief, contributions, were, to, the, study, of, troy, vi, and, vii, which, schliemann, had, overlooked, due, to, his, focus, on, troy, ii, d, rpfeld, s, interest, in, these, layers, was, triggered, by, the, need, to, close, a, hole, in, the, initial, excavators, chronology, known, as, calvert, s, thousand, year, gap, during, his, excavation, d, rpfeld, came, across, a, section, of, the, troy, vi, wall, which, was, weaker, than, the, rest, since, the, mythic, city, had, likewise, had, a, weak, section, of, its, walls, d, rpfeld, became, convinced, that, this, layer, corresponded, to, homeric, troy, schliemann, himself, privately, agreed, that, troy, vi, was, more, likely, to, be, the, homeric, city, but, he, never, published, anything, stating, so, carl, blegen, professor, at, the, university, of, cincinnati, managed, the, site, 1932, 38, wilhelm, d, rpfeld, collaborated, with, blegen, these, archaeologists, though, following, schliemann, s, lead, added, a, professional, approach, not, available, to, schliemann, he, showed, that, there, were, at, least, nine, cities, in, his, research, blegen, came, to, a, conclusion, that, troy, s, nine, levels, could, be, further, divided, into, forty, six, sublevels, which, he, published, in, his, main, report, a, post, hoc, correspondence, analysis, of, blegen, s, pottery, sequence, showed, a, 100, year, gap, between, troy, iii, and, troy, iv, combined, with, a, similar, analysis, of, the, pottery, sequences, of, korfmann, and, schliemann, this, suggests, that, for, a, time, in, the, late, early, bronze, age, occupation, contracted, to, the, western, end, of, the, citadel, mound, from, 1988, to, 2005, excavations, were, conducted, by, a, team, from, the, university, of, t, bingen, and, the, university, of, cincinnati, under, the, direction, of, professor, manfred, korfmann, with, professor, brian, rose, overseeing, post, bronze, age, greek, roman, byzantine, excavation, along, the, coast, of, the, aegean, sea, at, the, bay, of, troy, possible, evidence, of, a, battle, was, found, in, the, form, of, bronze, arrowheads, and, fire, damaged, human, remains, buried, in, layers, dated, to, the, early, 12th, century, bc, the, question, of, troy, vi, s, status, in, the, bronze, age, world, was, the, subject, of, a, sometimes, acerbic, debate, between, korfmann, and, the, t, bingen, historian, frank, kolb, in, 2001, 2002, one, of, the, major, discoveries, of, these, excavations, was, the, troy, vi, vii, lower, city, this, lower, town, had, a, wide, anti, chariot, defensive, ditch, backed, by, a, wooden, palisade, added, to, the, citadel, this, lower, town, would, have, brought, troy, up, to, an, area, of, around, 200, 000, square, meters, this, discovery, led, to, a, major, reinterpretation, of, the, site, which, had, previously, been, regarded, as, a, small, aristocratic, residence, rather, than, a, major, settlement, a, number, of, radiocarbon, dates, from, charcoal, samples, were, obtained, from, various, phases, of, the, troy, i, level, from, 2006, until, 2012, these, excavations, continued, under, the, direction, of, korfmann, s, colleague, ernst, pernicka, with, a, new, digging, permit, in, 2013, an, international, team, made, up, of, cross, disciplinary, experts, led, by, william, aylward, an, archaeologist, at, the, university, of, wisconsin, madison, was, to, carry, out, new, excavations, this, activity, was, to, be, conducted, under, the, auspices, of, anakkale, onsekiz, mart, university, and, was, to, use, the, new, technique, of, molecular, archaeology, a, few, days, before, the, wisconsin, team, was, to, leave, the, turkish, government, cancelled, about, 100, excavation, permits, throughout, turkey, including, wisconsin, s, since, 2014, excavations, have, been, conducted, by, a, anakkale, onsekiz, mart, university, team, led, by, r, stem, aslan, the, excavators, claim, to, have, found, a, level, 0, at, troy, near, the, entrance, of, troy, ii, with, the, new, level, pushing, the, city, s, history, back, 600, years, since, 2016, the, university, of, amsterdam, has, conducted, a, project, to, examine, the, 150, year, history, of, excavation, at, the, site, troy, i, v, predate, writing, and, thus, are, known, entirely, from, their, archaeological, remains, however, written, records, about, the, city, appear, starting, with, the, late, bronze, age, troy, vi, and, continuing, into, the, greek, and, roman, era, troy, viii, ix, troy, vi, vii, is, believed, to, be, the, city, referred, to, as, wilusa, and, taruisa, in, hittite, records, these, correspondences, were, first, proposed, in, 1924, by, e, forrer, on, the, basis, of, linguistic, similarities, since, taruisa, is, a, plausible, correspondent, of, the, greek, name, troia, and, wilusa, likewise, for, the, greek, wilios, later, ilios, subsequent, research, on, hittite, geography, has, made, these, identifications, more, secure, though, not, all, scholars, regard, them, as, firmly, established, texts, concerning, wilusa, are, of, particular, relevance, to, later, legends, since, they, suggest, that, wilusa, was, within, the, sphere, of, influence, of, mycenaean, greece, which, the, hittites, referred, to, as, ahhiyawa, pp, 1, 6, pp, 86, 181, 182, wilusa, first, appears, in, hittite, records, around, 1400, bc, when, it, was, one, of, the, twenty, two, states, of, the, assuwa, confederation, which, unsuccessfully, attempted, to, oppose, the, hittite, empire, circumstantial, evidence, raises, the, possibility, that, the, rebellion, was, supported, by, the, ahhiyawa, p, 59, by, the, late, 1300s, bc, wilusa, had, become, politically, aligned, with, the, hittites, texts, from, this, period, mention, two, kings, named, kukkunni, and, alaksandu, who, maintained, peaceful, relations, with, the, hittites, even, as, other, states, in, the, area, did, not, wilusan, soldiers, may, have, served, in, the, hittite, army, during, the, battle, of, kadesh, a, bit, later, wilusa, seems, to, have, experienced, the, political, turmoil, suffered, by, many, of, its, neighbors, references, in, the, manapa, tarhunta, letter, and, tawagalawa, letter, suggest, that, a, wilusan, king, either, rebelled, or, was, deposed, this, turmoil, may, have, been, related, to, the, exploits, of, piyamaradu, a, western, anatolian, warlord, who, toppled, other, pro, hittite, rulers, while, acting, on, behalf, the, ahhiyawa, however, piyamaradu, is, never, explicitly, identified, as, the, culprit, and, certain, features, of, the, text, suggest, that, he, was, not, pp, 107, 111, 182, 185, pp, 133, 134, 174, 177, the, final, reference, to, wilusa, in, the, historical, record, appears, in, the, milawata, letter, in, which, the, hittite, king, tudhaliya, iv, expresses, his, intention, to, reinstall, a, deposed, wilusan, king, named, walmu, pp, 112, 183, pp, 278, 279, 123, 131, 133, in, popular, writing, these, anecdotes, have, been, interpreted, as, evidence, for, a, historical, kernel, in, myths, of, the, trojan, war, however, scholars, have, not, found, historical, evidence, for, any, particular, event, from, the, legends, and, the, hittite, documents, do, not, suggest, that, wilusa, troy, was, ever, attacked, by, greeks, ahhiyawa, themselves, noted, hittiteologist, trevor, bryce, cautions, that, our, current, understanding, of, wilusa, s, history, does, not, provide, evidence, for, there, having, been, an, actual, trojan, war, since, the, less, material, one, has, the, more, easily, it, can, be, manipulated, to, fit, whatever, conclusion, one, wishes, to, come, up, with, pp, 183, 184, 186, according, to, herodotus, the, persian, king, xerxes, sacrificed, 1, 000, cattle, at, the, sanctuary, of, athena, ilias, while, marching, towards, greece, following, the, persian, defeat, in, 480, 479, ilion, and, its, territory, became, part, of, the, continental, possessions, of, mytilene, and, remained, under, mytilenaean, control, until, the, unsuccessful, mytilenean, revolt, in, 428, 427, athens, liberated, the, so, called, actaean, cities, called, actaean, cities, because, they, were, located, on, the, akt, or, promontory, of, the, mainland, north, of, lesbos, including, ilion, and, enrolled, these, communities, in, the, delian, league, athenian, influence, in, the, hellespont, waned, following, the, oligarchic, coup, of, 411, and, in, that, year, the, spartan, general, mindaros, emulated, xerxes, by, likewise, sacrificing, to, athena, ilias, from, c, 410, 399, ilion, was, within, the, sphere, of, influence, of, the, local, dynasts, at, lampsacus, zenis, his, wife, mania, and, the, usurper, meidias, who, administered, the, region, on, behalf, of, the, persian, satrap, pharnabazus, in, 399, the, spartan, general, dercylidas, expelled, the, greek, garrison, at, ilion, who, were, controlling, the, city, on, behalf, of, the, lampsacene, dynasts, during, a, campaign, which, rolled, back, persian, influence, throughout, the, troad, ilion, remained, outside, the, control, of, the, persian, satrapal, administration, at, dascylium, until, the, peace, of, antalcidas, in, 387, 386, in, this, period, of, renewed, persian, control, c, 387, 367, a, statue, of, ariobarzanes, the, satrap, of, hellespontine, phrygia, was, erected, in, front, of, the, temple, of, athena, ilias, in, 360, 359, the, city, was, briefly, controlled, by, charidemus, of, oreus, a, euboean, mercenary, leader, who, occasionally, worked, for, the, athenians, in, 359, he, was, expelled, by, the, athenian, menelaos, son, of, arrabaios, whom, the, ilians, honoured, with, a, grant, of, proxeny, this, is, recorded, in, the, earliest, civic, decree, to, survive, from, ilion, in, may, 334, alexander, the, great, crossed, the, hellespont, and, came, to, the, city, where, he, visited, the, temple, of, athena, ilias, made, sacrifices, at, the, tombs, of, the, homeric, heroes, and, made, the, city, free, and, exempt, from, taxes, according, to, the, so, called, last, plans, of, alexander, which, became, known, after, his, death, in, june, 323, he, had, planned, to, rebuild, the, temple, of, athena, ilias, on, a, scale, that, would, have, surpassed, every, other, temple, in, the, known, world, antigonus, monophthalmus, took, control, of, the, troad, in, 311, and, created, the, new, city, of, antigoneia, troas, which, was, a, synoikism, of, the, cities, of, skepsis, kebren, neandreia, hamaxitos, larisa, and, kolonai, in, c, 311, 306, the, koinon, of, athena, ilias, was, founded, from, the, remaining, cities, in, the, troad, and, along, the, asian, coast, of, the, dardanelles, and, soon, after, succeeded, in, securing, a, guarantee, from, antigonus, that, he, would, respect, their, autonomy, and, freedom, he, had, not, respected, the, autonomy, of, the, cities, which, were, synoikized, to, create, antigoneia, the, koinon, continued, to, function, until, at, least, the, 1st, century, ad, and, primarily, consisted, of, cities, from, the, troad, although, for, a, time, in, the, second, half, of, the, 3rd, century, it, also, included, myrlea, and, chalcedon, from, the, eastern, propontis, the, governing, body, of, the, koinon, was, the, synedrion, on, which, each, city, was, represented, by, two, delegates, the, day, to, day, running, of, the, synedrion, especially, in, relation, to, its, finances, was, left, to, a, college, of, five, agonothetai, on, which, no, city, ever, had, more, than, one, representative, this, system, of, equal, rather, than, proportional, representation, ensured, that, no, one, city, could, politically, dominate, the, koinon, the, primary, purpose, of, the, koinon, was, to, organize, the, annual, panathenaia, festival, which, was, held, at, the, sanctuary, of, athena, ilias, the, festival, brought, huge, numbers, of, pilgrims, to, ilion, for, the, duration, of, the, festival, as, well, as, creating, an, enormous, market, the, panegyris, which, attracted, traders, from, across, the, region, in, addition, the, koinon, financed, new, building, projects, at, ilion, for, example, a, new, theatre, c, 306, and, the, expansion, of, the, sanctuary, and, temple, of, athena, ilias, in, the, 3rd, century, in, order, to, make, the, city, a, suitable, venue, for, such, a, large, festival, in, the, period, 302, 281, ilion, and, the, troad, were, part, of, the, kingdom, of, lysimachus, who, during, this, time, helped, ilion, synoikize, several, nearby, communities, thus, expanding, the, city, s, population, and, territory, lysimachus, was, defeated, at, the, battle, of, corupedium, in, february, 281, by, seleucus, i, nikator, thus, handing, the, seleucid, kingdom, control, of, asia, minor, and, in, august, or, september, 281, when, seleucus, passed, through, the, troad, on, his, way, to, lysimachia, in, the, nearby, thracian, chersonese, ilion, passed, a, decree, in, honour, of, him, indicating, the, city, s, new, loyalties, in, september, seleucus, was, assassinated, at, lysimachia, by, ptolemy, keraunos, making, his, successor, antiochus, i, soter, the, new, king, in, 280, or, soon, after, ilion, passed, a, long, decree, lavishly, honouring, antiochus, in, order, to, cement, their, relationship, with, him, during, this, period, ilion, still, lacked, proper, city, walls, except, for, the, crumbling, troy, vi, fortifications, around, the, citadel, and, in, 278, during, the, gallic, invasion, the, city, was, easily, sacked, ilion, enjoyed, a, close, relationship, with, antiochus, for, the, rest, of, his, reign, for, example, in, 274, antiochus, granted, land, to, his, friend, aristodikides, of, assos, which, for, tax, purposes, was, to, be, attached, to, the, territory, of, ilion, and, c, 275, 269, ilion, passed, a, decree, in, honour, of, metrodoros, of, amphipolis, who, had, successfully, treated, the, king, for, a, wound, he, received, in, battle, the, city, was, destroyed, by, sulla, s, rival, the, roman, general, fimbria, in, 85, bc, following, an, eleven, day, siege, later, that, year, when, sulla, had, defeated, fimbria, he, bestowed, benefactions, on, ilion, for, its, loyalty, which, helped, rebuilding, the, city, ilion, reciprocated, this, act, of, generosity, by, instituting, a, new, civic, calendar, which, took, 85, bc, as, its, first, year, however, the, city, remained, in, financial, distress, for, several, decades, despite, its, favoured, status, with, rome, in, the, 80s, bc, roman, publicani, illegally, levied, taxes, on, the, sacred, estates, of, athena, ilias, and, the, city, was, required, to, call, on, l, julius, caesar, for, restitution, while, in, 80, bc, the, city, suffered, an, attack, by, pirates, in, 77, bc, the, costs, of, running, the, annual, festival, of, the, koinon, of, athena, ilias, became, too, pressing, for, both, ilion, and, the, other, members, of, the, koinon, and, l, julius, caesar, was, once, again, required, to, arbitrate, this, time, reforming, the, festival, so, that, it, would, be, less, of, a, financial, burden, in, 74, bc, the, ilians, once, again, demonstrated, their, loyalty, to, rome, by, siding, with, the, roman, general, lucullus, against, mithridates, vi, following, the, final, defeat, of, mithridates, in, 63, 62, pompey, rewarded, the, city, s, loyalty, by, becoming, the, benefactor, of, ilion, and, patron, of, athena, ilias, in, 48, bc, gaius, julius, caesar, likewise, bestowed, benefactions, on, the, city, recalling, the, city, s, loyalty, during, the, mithridatic, wars, the, city, s, connection, with, his, cousin, lucius, and, the, family, s, claim, that, they, were, ultimately, descended, from, venus, through, the, trojan, prince, aeneas, and, therefore, shared, kinship, with, the, ilians, in, 20, bc, the, emperor, augustus, gaius, octavian, julius, caesar, augustus, visited, ilion, and, stayed, in, the, house, of, a, leading, citizen, melanippides, son, of, euthydikos, as, a, result, of, his, visit, he, also, financed, the, restoration, and, rebuilding, of, the, sanctuary, of, athena, ilias, the, bouleuterion, council, house, and, the, theatre, soon, after, work, on, the, theatre, was, completed, in, 12, 11, bc, melanippides, dedicated, a, statue, of, augustus, in, the, theatre, to, record, this, benefaction, a, new, city, called, ilium, from, greek, ilion, was, founded, on, the, site, in, the, reign, of, the, roman, emperor, augustus, it, flourished, until, the, establishment, of, constantinople, which, became, a, bishopric, in, the, roman, province, hellespontus, civil, diocese, of, asia, but, declined, gradually, in, the, byzantine, era, from, the, 4th, century, ad, until, the, byzantine, era, perhaps, as, late, as, the, 10th, century, ilion, was, the, seat, of, a, christian, bishop, the, main, literary, work, set, at, troy, is, the, iliad, an, archaic, era, epic, poem, which, tells, the, story, of, the, final, year, of, the, trojan, war, the, iliad, portrays, troy, as, the, capital, of, a, rich, and, powerful, kingdom, in, the, poem, the, city, appears, to, be, a, major, regional, power, capable, of, summoning, numerous, allies, to, defend, it, the, city, itself, is, described, as, sitting, on, a, steep, hill, protected, by, enormous, sloping, stone, walls, rectangular, towers, and, massive, gates, whose, wooden, doors, can, be, bolted, shut, according, to, dares, phrygius, there, were, 6, of, such, gates, the, antenorean, the, dardanian, the, ilian, the, scaean, the, thymbraean, and, the, trojan, the, city, s, streets, are, broad, and, well, planned, at, the, top, of, the, hill, is, the, temple, of, athena, as, well, as, king, priam, s, palace, an, enormous, structure, with, numerous, rooms, around, an, inner, courtyard, pp, 59, 61, in, the, iliad, the, achaeans, set, up, their, camp, near, the, mouth, of, the, scamander, river, where, they, beached, their, ships, the, city, itself, stood, on, a, hill, across, the, plain, of, scamander, where, much, of, the, fighting, takes, place, besides, the, iliad, there, are, references, to, troy, in, the, other, major, work, attributed, to, homer, the, odyssey, as, well, as, in, other, ancient, greek, literature, such, as, aeschylus, s, oresteia, the, homeric, legend, of, troy, was, elaborated, by, the, roman, poet, virgil, in, his, aeneid, the, fall, of, troy, with, the, story, of, the, trojan, horse, and, the, sacrifice, of, polyxena, priam, s, youngest, daughter, is, the, subject, of, a, later, greek, epic, by, quintus, smyrnaeus, quintus, of, smyrna, the, greeks, and, romans, took, for, a, fact, the, historicity, of, the, trojan, war, and, the, identity, of, homeric, troy, with, a, site, in, anatolia, on, a, peninsula, called, the, troad, biga, peninsula, alexander, the, great, for, example, visited, the, site, in, 334, bc, and, there, made, sacrifices, at, tombs, associated, with, the, homeric, heroes, achilles, and, patroclus, pp158, 191, p724, the, turkish, government, created, the, historical, national, park, at, troy, on, september, 30, 1996, it, contains, 136, square, kilometres, 53, sq, mi, to, include, troy, and, its, vicinity, centered, on, troy, the, purpose, of, the, park, is, to, protect, the, historical, sites, and, monuments, within, it, as, well, as, the, environment, of, the, region, in, 1998, the, park, was, accepted, as, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, public, access, to, the, ancient, site, is, along, the, road, from, the, vicinity, of, the, museum, in, tevfikiye, to, the, east, side, of, hisarl, k,
