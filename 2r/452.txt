the, 1918, 1920, flu, pandemic, also, known, as, the, great, influenza, epidemic, or, by, the, common, misnomer, spanish, flu, was, an, exceptionally, deadly, global, influenza, pandemic, caused, by, the, h1n1, subtype, of, the, influenza, a, virus, the, earliest, documented, case, was, march, 1918, in, the, state, of, kansas, in, the, united, states, with, further, cases, recorded, in, france, germany, and, the, united, kingdom, in, april, two, years, later, nearly, a, third, of, the, global, population, or, an, estimated, 500, million, people, had, been, infected, in, four, successive, waves, estimates, of, deaths, range, from, 17, million, to, 50, million, and, possibly, as, high, as, 100, million, making, it, one, of, the, deadliest, pandemics, in, history, the, pandemic, broke, out, near, the, end, of, world, war, i, when, wartime, censors, in, the, belligerent, countries, suppressed, bad, news, to, maintain, morale, but, newspapers, freely, reported, the, outbreak, in, neutral, spain, creating, a, false, impression, of, spain, as, the, epicenter, and, leading, to, the, spanish, flu, misnomer, limited, historical, epidemiological, data, make, the, pandemic, s, geographic, origin, indeterminate, with, competing, hypotheses, on, the, initial, spread, most, influenza, outbreaks, disproportionately, kill, the, young, and, old, with, a, higher, survival, rate, in, between, but, this, pandemic, had, unusually, high, mortality, for, young, adults, scientists, offer, several, explanations, for, the, high, mortality, including, a, six, year, climate, anomaly, affecting, migration, of, disease, vectors, with, increased, likelihood, of, spread, through, bodies, of, water, however, the, claim, that, young, adults, had, a, high, mortality, during, the, pandemic, has, been, contested, malnourishment, overcrowded, medical, camps, and, hospitals, and, poor, hygiene, exacerbated, by, the, war, promoted, bacterial, superinfection, killing, most, of, the, victims, after, a, typically, prolonged, death, bed, the, 1918, spanish, flu, was, the, first, of, three, flu, pandemics, caused, by, h1n1, influenza, a, virus, the, others, being, the, 1977, russian, flu, and, the, 2009, swine, flu, pandemics, this, pandemic, was, known, by, many, different, names, some, old, some, new, depending, on, place, time, and, context, the, etymology, of, alternative, names, historicises, the, scourge, and, its, effects, on, people, who, would, only, learn, years, later, that, invisible, viruses, caused, influenza, the, lack, of, scientific, answers, led, the, sierra, leone, weekly, news, freetown, to, suggest, a, biblical, framing, in, july, 1918, using, an, interrogative, from, exodus, 16, in, ancient, hebrew, one, thing, is, for, certain, the, doctors, are, at, present, flabbergasted, and, we, suggest, that, rather, than, calling, the, disease, influenza, they, should, for, the, present, until, they, have, it, in, hand, say, man, hu, what, is, it, outbreaks, of, influenza, like, illness, were, documented, in, 1916, 17, at, british, military, hospitals, in, taples, france, and, just, across, the, english, channel, at, aldershot, england, clinical, indications, in, common, with, the, 1918, pandemic, included, rapid, symptom, progression, to, a, dusky, heliotrope, cyanosis, of, the, face, this, characteristic, blue, violet, cyanosis, in, expiring, patients, led, to, the, name, purple, death, the, aldershot, physicians, later, wrote, in, the, lancet, the, influenza, pneumococcal, purulent, bronchitis, we, and, others, described, in, 1916, and, 1917, is, fundamentally, the, same, condition, as, the, influenza, of, this, present, pandemic, this, purulent, bronchitis, is, not, yet, linked, to, the, same, a, h1n1, virus, but, it, may, be, a, precursor, in, 1918, epidemic, influenza, italian, influenza, influence, also, known, at, the, time, as, the, grip, french, la, grippe, grasp, appeared, in, kansas, in, the, u, s, during, late, spring, and, early, reports, from, spain, began, appearing, on, 21, may, reports, from, both, places, called, it, three, day, fever, fiebre, de, los, tres, d, as, many, alternative, names, are, exonyms, in, the, practice, of, making, new, infectious, diseases, seem, foreign, this, pattern, was, observed, even, before, the, 1889, 1890, pandemic, also, known, as, the, russian, flu, when, the, russians, already, called, epidemic, influenza, the, chinese, catarrh, the, germans, called, it, the, russian, pest, while, the, italians, in, turn, called, it, the, german, disease, these, epithets, were, re, used, in, the, 1918, pandemic, along, with, new, ones, outside, spain, the, disease, was, soon, misnamed, spanish, influenza, in, a, 2, june, 1918, the, times, of, london, dispatch, titled, the, spanish, epidemic, a, correspondent, in, madrid, reported, over, 100, 000, victims, of, the, unknown, disease, clearly, of, a, gripal, character, without, referring, to, spanish, influenza, directly, three, weeks, later, the, times, reported, that, everybody, thinks, of, it, as, the, spanish, influenza, to, day, three, days, after, that, an, advertisement, appeared, in, the, times, for, formamint, tablets, to, prevent, spanish, influenza, when, it, reached, moscow, pravda, announced, isp, nka, the, spanish, lady, is, in, town, making, the, spanish, lady, another, common, name, the, outbreak, did, not, originate, in, spain, see, below, but, reporting, did, due, to, wartime, censorship, in, belligerent, nations, spain, was, a, neutral, country, unconcerned, with, appearances, of, combat, readiness, and, without, a, wartime, propaganda, machine, to, prop, up, morale, so, its, newspapers, freely, reported, epidemic, effects, including, king, alfonso, xiii, s, illness, making, spain, the, apparent, locus, of, the, epidemic, the, censorship, was, so, effective, that, spain, s, health, officials, were, unaware, its, neighboring, countries, were, similarly, affected, in, an, october, 1918, madrid, letter, to, the, journal, of, the, american, medical, association, a, spanish, official, protested, we, were, surprised, to, learn, that, the, disease, was, making, ravages, in, other, countries, and, that, people, there, were, calling, it, the, spanish, grip, and, wherefore, spanish, this, epidemic, was, not, born, in, spain, and, this, should, be, recorded, as, a, historic, vindication, but, before, this, letter, could, be, published, the, serbian, newspaper, corfu, said, various, countries, have, been, assigning, the, origin, of, this, imposing, guest, to, each, other, for, quite, some, time, and, at, one, point, in, time, they, agreed, to, assign, its, origin, to, the, kind, and, neutral, spain, french, press, initially, used, american, flu, but, adopted, spanish, flu, in, lieu, of, antagonizing, an, ally, in, the, spring, of, 1918, british, soldiers, called, it, flanders, flu, while, german, soldiers, used, flandern, fieber, flemish, fever, both, after, a, famous, battlefield, in, belgium, where, many, soldiers, on, both, sides, fell, ill, in, senegal, it, was, named, brazilian, flu, and, in, brazil, german, flu, in, spain, it, was, also, known, as, the, french, flu, gripe, francesa, or, the, naples, soldier, soldado, de, n, poles, after, a, popular, song, from, a, zarzuela, spanish, flu, gripe, espa, ola, is, now, a, common, name, in, spain, but, remains, controversial, there, other, names, derived, from, geopolitical, borders, and, social, boundaries, in, poland, it, was, the, bolshevik, disease, while, the, bolsheviks, referred, to, it, as, the, kirghiz, disease, some, africans, called, it, a, white, man, s, sickness, but, in, south, africa, white, men, also, used, the, ethnophaulism, kaffersiekte, lit, negro, disease, japan, blamed, sumo, wrestlers, for, bringing, the, disease, home, from, a, match, in, taiwan, by, calling, it, sumo, flu, sumo, kaze, even, though, three, top, wrestlers, died, there, world, health, organization, best, practices, first, published, in, 2015, now, aim, to, prevent, social, stigma, by, no, longer, associating, culturally, significant, names, with, new, diseases, listing, spanish, flu, under, examples, to, be, avoided, many, authors, now, eschew, calling, this, the, spanish, flu, instead, using, variations, of, 1918, 19, 20, flu, influenza, pandemic, some, language, endonyms, did, not, name, specific, regions, or, groups, of, people, examples, specific, to, this, pandemic, include, northern, ndebele, malibuzwe, let, enquiries, be, made, concerning, it, swahili, ugonjo, huo, kichwa, na, kukohoa, na, kiuno, the, disease, of, head, and, coughing, and, spine, yao, chipindupindu, disease, from, seeking, to, make, a, profit, in, wartime, otjiherero, kaapitohanga, disease, which, passes, through, like, a, bullet, and, persian, nakhushi, yi, bad, disease, of, the, wind, this, outbreak, was, also, commonly, known, as, the, great, influenza, epidemic, after, the, great, war, a, common, name, for, world, war, i, before, world, war, ii, french, military, doctors, originally, called, it, disease, 11, maladie, onze, german, doctors, downplayed, the, severity, by, calling, it, pseudo, influenza, latin, pseudo, false, while, in, africa, doctors, tried, to, get, patients, to, take, it, more, seriously, by, calling, it, influenza, vera, latin, vera, true, a, children, s, song, from, the, 1889, 90, flu, pandemic, was, shortened, and, adapted, into, a, skipping, rope, rhyme, popular, in, 1918, it, is, a, metaphor, for, the, transmissibility, of, influenza, where, that, name, was, clipped, to, the, apheresis, enza, i, had, a, little, bird, its, name, was, enza, i, opened, the, window, and, in, flu, enza, the, pandemic, is, conventionally, marked, as, having, begun, on, 4, march, 1918, with, the, recording, of, the, case, of, albert, gitchell, an, army, cook, at, camp, funston, in, kansas, united, states, despite, there, having, been, cases, before, him, the, disease, had, already, been, observed, 200, miles, 320, km, away, in, haskell, county, as, early, as, january, 1918, prompting, local, doctor, loring, miner, to, warn, the, editors, of, the, u, s, public, health, service, s, academic, journal, public, health, reports, within, days, of, the, 4, march, first, case, at, camp, funston, 522, men, at, the, camp, had, reported, sick, by, 11, march, 1918, the, virus, had, reached, queens, new, york, failure, to, take, preventive, measures, in, march, april, was, later, criticized, as, the, u, s, had, entered, world, war, i, the, disease, quickly, spread, from, camp, funston, a, major, training, ground, for, troops, of, the, american, expeditionary, forces, to, other, u, s, army, camps, and, europe, becoming, an, epidemic, in, the, midwest, east, coast, and, french, ports, by, april, 1918, and, reaching, the, western, front, by, the, middle, of, the, month, it, then, quickly, spread, to, the, rest, of, france, great, britain, italy, and, spain, and, in, may, reached, wroc, aw, and, odessa, after, the, signing, of, the, treaty, of, brest, litovsk, march, 1918, germany, started, releasing, russian, prisoners, of, war, who, then, brought, the, disease, to, their, country, it, reached, north, africa, india, and, japan, in, may, and, soon, after, had, likely, gone, around, the, world, as, there, had, been, recorded, cases, in, southeast, asia, in, april, in, june, an, outbreak, was, reported, in, china, after, reaching, australia, in, july, the, wave, started, to, recede, the, first, wave, of, the, flu, lasted, from, the, first, quarter, of, 1918, and, was, relatively, mild, mortality, rates, were, not, appreciably, above, normal, in, the, united, states, 75, 000, flu, related, deaths, were, reported, in, the, first, six, months, of, 1918, compared, to, 63, 000, deaths, during, the, same, time, period, in, 1915, in, madrid, spain, fewer, than, 1, 000, people, died, from, influenza, between, may, and, june, 1918, there, were, no, reported, quarantines, during, the, first, quarter, of, 1918, however, the, first, wave, caused, a, significant, disruption, in, the, military, operations, of, world, war, i, with, three, quarters, of, french, troops, half, the, british, forces, and, over, 900, 000, german, soldiers, sick, the, second, wave, began, in, the, second, half, of, august, 1918, probably, spreading, to, boston, massachusetts, and, freetown, sierra, leone, by, ships, from, brest, where, it, had, likely, arrived, with, american, troops, or, french, recruits, for, naval, training, from, the, boston, navy, yard, and, camp, devens, later, renamed, fort, devens, about, 30, miles, west, of, boston, other, u, s, military, sites, were, soon, afflicted, as, were, troops, being, transported, to, europe, helped, by, troop, movements, it, spread, over, the, next, two, months, to, all, of, north, america, and, then, to, central, and, south, america, also, reaching, brazil, and, the, caribbean, on, ships, in, july, 1918, the, ottoman, empire, saw, its, first, cases, in, some, soldiers, from, freetown, the, pandemic, continued, to, spread, through, west, africa, along, the, coast, rivers, and, the, colonial, railways, and, from, railheads, to, more, remote, communities, while, south, africa, received, it, in, september, on, ships, bringing, back, members, of, the, south, african, native, labour, corps, returning, from, france, from, there, it, spread, around, southern, africa, and, beyond, the, zambezi, reaching, ethiopia, in, november, on, 15, september, new, york, city, saw, its, first, fatality, from, influenza, the, philadelphia, liberty, loans, parade, held, in, philadelphia, pennsylvania, on, 28, september, 1918, to, promote, government, bonds, for, world, war, i, resulted, in, 12, 000, deaths, after, a, major, outbreak, of, the, illness, spread, among, people, who, had, attended, the, parade, from, europe, the, second, wave, swept, through, russia, in, a, southwest, northeast, diagonal, front, as, well, as, being, brought, to, arkhangelsk, by, the, north, russia, intervention, and, then, spread, throughout, asia, following, the, russian, civil, war, and, the, trans, siberian, railway, reaching, iran, where, it, spread, through, the, holy, city, of, mashhad, and, then, later, india, in, september, as, well, as, china, and, japan, in, october, the, celebrations, of, the, armistice, of, 11, november, 1918, also, caused, outbreaks, in, lima, and, nairobi, but, by, december, the, wave, was, mostly, over, the, second, wave, of, the, 1918, pandemic, was, much, more, deadly, than, the, first, the, first, wave, had, resembled, typical, flu, epidemics, those, most, at, risk, were, the, sick, and, elderly, while, younger, healthier, people, recovered, easily, october, 1918, was, the, month, with, the, highest, fatality, rate, of, the, whole, pandemic, in, the, united, states, 292, 000, deaths, were, reported, between, september, december, 1918, compared, to, 26, 000, during, the, same, time, period, in, 1915, the, netherlands, reported, over, 40, 000, deaths, from, influenza, and, acute, respiratory, disease, bombay, reported, 15, 000, deaths, in, a, population, of, 1, 1, million, the, 1918, flu, pandemic, in, india, was, especially, deadly, with, an, estimated, 12, 5, 20, million, deaths, in, the, last, quarter, of, 1918, alone, pandemic, activity, persisted, in, general, into, 1919, in, many, places, this, persistence, in, activity, is, possibly, attributable, to, climate, specifically, in, the, northern, hemisphere, where, it, was, winter, and, thus, the, usual, time, for, influenza, activity, the, pandemic, nonetheless, continued, into, 1919, largely, independent, of, region, and, climate, cases, began, to, rise, again, in, some, parts, of, the, united, states, as, early, as, late, november, 1918, with, the, public, health, service, issuing, its, first, report, of, a, recrudescence, of, the, disease, being, felt, in, widely, scattered, localities, in, early, december, this, resurgent, activity, varied, across, the, country, however, possibly, on, account, of, differing, restrictions, michigan, for, example, experienced, a, swift, resurgence, of, influenza, that, reached, its, peak, in, december, possibly, as, a, result, of, the, lifting, of, the, ban, on, public, gatherings, pandemic, interventions, such, as, bans, on, public, gatherings, and, the, closing, of, schools, were, reimposed, in, many, places, in, an, attempt, to, suppress, the, spread, there, was, a, very, sudden, and, very, marked, rise, in, general, death, rate, in, most, cities, in, january, 1919, nearly, all, experienced, some, degree, of, recrudescence, of, the, flu, in, january, and, february, 153, 154, significant, outbreaks, occurred, in, cities, including, los, angeles, new, york, city, memphis, nashville, san, francisco, and, st, louis, by, 21, february, with, some, local, variation, influenza, activity, was, reported, to, have, been, declining, since, mid, january, in, all, parts, of, the, country, following, this, first, great, epidemic, period, that, had, commenced, in, october, 1918, deaths, from, pneumonia, and, influenza, were, somewhat, below, average, in, the, large, cities, of, the, united, states, between, may, 1919, and, january, 1920, 158, nonetheless, nearly, 160, 000, deaths, were, attributed, to, these, causes, in, the, first, six, months, of, 1919, it, was, not, until, later, in, the, winter, and, into, the, spring, that, a, clearer, resurgence, appeared, in, europe, a, significant, third, wave, had, developed, in, england, and, wales, by, mid, february, peaking, in, early, march, though, it, did, not, fully, subside, until, may, france, also, experienced, a, significant, wave, that, peaked, in, february, alongside, the, netherlands, norway, finland, and, switzerland, saw, recrudescences, of, pandemic, activity, in, march, and, sweden, in, april, much, of, spain, was, affected, by, a, substantial, recrudescent, wave, of, influenza, between, january, and, april, 1919, portugal, experienced, a, resurgence, in, pandemic, activity, that, lasted, from, march, to, september, 1919, with, the, greatest, impact, being, felt, on, the, west, coast, and, in, the, north, of, the, country, all, districts, were, affected, between, april, and, may, specifically, influenza, entered, australia, for, the, first, time, in, january, 1919, after, a, strict, maritime, quarantine, had, shielded, the, country, through, the, latter, part, of, 1918, it, assumed, epidemic, proportions, first, in, melbourne, peaking, in, mid, february, the, flu, soon, appeared, in, neighboring, new, south, wales, and, south, australia, and, then, spread, across, the, country, throughout, the, year, new, south, wales, experienced, its, first, wave, of, infection, between, mid, march, and, late, may, while, a, second, more, severe, wave, occurred, in, victoria, between, april, and, june, land, quarantine, measures, hindered, the, spread, of, the, disease, resulting, in, varied, experiences, of, exposures, and, outbreaks, among, the, various, states, queensland, was, not, infected, until, late, april, western, australia, avoided, the, disease, until, early, june, and, tasmania, remained, free, from, it, until, mid, august, out, of, the, six, states, victoria, and, new, south, wales, experienced, generally, more, extensive, epidemics, each, experienced, another, significant, wave, of, illness, over, the, winter, the, second, epidemic, in, new, south, wales, was, more, severe, than, the, first, while, victoria, saw, a, third, wave, that, was, somewhat, less, extensive, than, its, second, more, akin, to, its, first, the, disease, also, reached, other, parts, of, the, world, for, the, first, time, in, 1919, such, as, madagascar, which, saw, its, first, cases, in, april, the, outbreak, had, spread, to, practically, all, sections, of, the, island, by, june, in, other, parts, influenza, recurred, in, the, form, of, a, true, third, wave, hong, kong, experienced, another, outbreak, in, june, as, did, south, africa, during, its, fall, and, winter, months, in, the, southern, hemisphere, new, zealand, also, experienced, some, cases, in, may, parts, of, south, america, experienced, a, resurgence, of, pandemic, activity, throughout, 1919, a, third, wave, hit, brazil, between, january, and, june, between, july, 1919, and, february, 1920, chile, which, had, been, affected, for, the, first, time, just, in, october, 1918, experienced, a, severe, second, wave, with, mortality, peaking, in, august, 1919, montevideo, similarly, experienced, a, second, outbreak, between, july, and, september, the, third, wave, particularly, affected, spain, serbia, mexico, and, great, britain, resulting, in, hundreds, of, thousands, of, deaths, it, was, in, general, less, severe, than, the, second, wave, but, still, much, more, deadly, than, the, initial, first, wave, in, the, northern, hemisphere, fears, of, a, recurrence, of, the, flu, grew, as, fall, approached, experts, cited, the, history, of, past, flu, epidemics, such, as, that, of, 1889, 1890, to, predict, that, such, a, recurrence, a, year, later, was, not, unlikely, though, not, all, agreed, in, september, 1919, u, s, surgeon, general, rupert, blue, said, a, return, of, the, flu, later, in, the, year, would, probably, but, by, no, means, certainly, occur, france, had, readied, a, public, information, campaign, before, the, end, of, the, summer, and, britain, began, preparations, in, the, fall, with, the, manufacture, of, vaccine, in, japan, the, flu, broke, out, again, in, december, and, spread, rapidly, throughout, the, country, a, fact, attributed, at, the, time, to, the, coming, of, cold, weather, pandemic, related, measures, were, renewed, to, check, the, spread, of, the, outbreak, and, health, authorities, recommended, the, use, of, masks, the, epidemic, intensified, in, the, latter, part, of, december, before, swiftly, peaking, in, january, between, october, 1919, and, 23, january, 1920, 780, 000, cases, were, reported, across, the, country, with, at, least, 20, 000, deaths, recorded, by, that, date, this, apparently, reflected, a, condition, of, severity, three, times, greater, than, for, the, corresponding, period, of, 1918, 1919, during, japan, s, first, epidemic, nonetheless, the, disease, was, regarded, as, being, milder, than, it, had, been, the, year, before, albeit, more, infectious, despite, its, rapid, peak, at, the, beginning, of, the, year, the, outbreak, persisted, throughout, the, winter, before, subsiding, in, the, spring, in, the, united, states, there, were, almost, continuously, isolated, or, solitary, cases, of, flu, throughout, the, spring, and, summer, months, of, 1919, an, increase, in, scattered, cases, became, apparent, as, early, as, september, but, chicago, experienced, one, of, the, first, major, outbreaks, of, the, flu, beginning, in, the, middle, of, january, the, public, health, service, announced, it, would, take, steps, to, localize, the, epidemic, but, the, disease, was, already, causing, a, simultaneous, outbreak, in, kansas, city, and, quickly, spread, outward, from, the, center, of, the, country, in, no, clear, direction, a, few, days, after, its, first, announcement, phs, issued, another, assuring, that, the, disease, was, under, the, control, of, state, health, authorities, and, that, an, outbreak, of, epidemic, proportions, was, not, expected, it, became, apparent, within, days, of, the, start, of, chicago, s, explosive, growth, in, cases, that, the, flu, was, spreading, in, the, city, at, an, even, faster, rate, than, in, winter, 1919, though, fewer, were, dying, within, a, week, new, cases, in, the, city, had, surpassed, its, peak, during, the, 1919, wave, around, the, same, time, new, york, city, began, to, see, its, own, sudden, increase, in, cases, and, other, cities, around, the, country, were, soon, to, follow, certain, pandemic, restrictions, such, as, the, closing, of, schools, and, theaters, and, the, staggering, of, business, hours, to, avoid, congestion, were, reimposed, in, cities, like, chicago, memphis, and, new, york, city, as, they, had, during, the, epidemic, in, fall, 1918, schools, in, new, york, city, remained, open, while, those, in, memphis, were, shuttered, as, part, of, more, general, restrictions, on, public, gatherings, the, fourth, wave, in, the, united, states, subsided, as, swiftly, as, it, had, appeared, reaching, a, peak, in, early, february, an, epidemic, of, considerable, proportions, marked, the, early, months, of, 1920, the, u, s, mortality, statistics, would, later, note, according, to, data, at, this, time, the, epidemic, resulted, in, one, third, as, many, deaths, as, the, 1918, 1919, experience, new, york, city, alone, reported, 6, 374, deaths, between, december, 1919, and, april, 1920, almost, twice, the, number, of, the, first, wave, in, spring, 1918, other, u, s, cities, including, detroit, milwaukee, kansas, city, minneapolis, and, st, louis, were, hit, particularly, hard, with, death, rates, higher, than, all, of, 1918, the, territory, of, hawaii, experienced, its, peak, of, the, pandemic, in, early, 1920, recording, 1, 489, deaths, from, flu, related, causes, compared, with, 615, in, 1918, and, 796, in, 1919, poland, experienced, a, devastating, outbreak, during, the, winter, months, with, its, capital, warsaw, reaching, a, peak, of, 158, deaths, in, a, single, week, compared, to, the, peak, of, 92, reached, in, december, 1918, however, the, 1920, epidemic, passed, in, a, matter, of, weeks, while, the, 1918, 1919, wave, had, developed, over, the, entire, second, half, of, 1918, by, contrast, the, outbreak, in, western, europe, was, considered, benign, with, the, age, distribution, of, deaths, beginning, to, take, on, that, of, seasonal, flu, five, countries, in, europe, spain, denmark, finland, germany, and, switzerland, recorded, a, late, peak, between, january, april, 1920, mexico, experienced, a, fourth, wave, between, february, and, march, in, south, america, peru, experienced, asynchronous, recrudescent, waves, throughout, the, year, a, severe, third, wave, hit, lima, the, capital, city, between, january, and, march, resulting, in, an, all, cause, excess, mortality, rate, approximately, four, times, greater, than, that, of, the, 1918, 1919, wave, ica, similarly, experienced, another, severe, pandemic, wave, in, 1920, between, july, and, october, a, fourth, wave, also, occurred, in, brazil, in, february, korea, and, taiwan, both, colonies, of, japan, at, this, time, also, experienced, pronounced, outbreaks, in, late, 1919, and, early, 1920, by, mid, 1920, the, pandemic, was, largely, considered, to, be, over, by, the, public, as, well, as, governments, though, parts, of, chile, experienced, a, third, milder, wave, between, november, 1920, and, march, 1921, the, flu, seemed, to, be, mostly, absent, through, the, winter, of, 1920, 1921, 167, in, the, united, states, for, example, deaths, from, pneumonia, and, influenza, were, very, much, lower, than, for, many, years, 167, influenza, began, to, be, reported, again, from, many, places, in, 1921, 168, the, pandemic, continued, to, be, felt, in, chile, where, a, fourth, wave, affected, seven, of, its, 24, provinces, between, june, and, december, 1921, the, winter, of, 1921, 1922, was, the, first, major, reappearance, of, seasonal, influenza, in, the, northern, hemisphere, after, the, pandemic, ended, in, many, parts, its, most, significant, occurrence, since, the, main, pandemic, in, late, 1918, northwestern, europe, was, particularly, affected, all, cause, mortality, in, the, netherlands, approximately, doubled, in, january, 1922, alone, 168, in, helsinki, a, major, epidemic, the, fifth, since, 1918, prevailed, between, november, and, december, 1921, the, flu, was, also, widespread, in, the, united, states, its, prevalence, in, california, reportedly, greater, in, early, march, 1922, than, at, any, point, since, the, pandemic, ended, in, 1920, 172, in, the, years, after, 1920, the, disease, a, novel, one, in, 1918, assumed, a, more, familiar, nature, coming, to, represent, at, least, one, form, of, the, seasonal, flu, the, virus, h1n1, remained, endemic, occasionally, causing, more, severe, or, otherwise, notable, outbreaks, as, it, gradually, evolved, over, the, years, the, period, since, its, initial, appearance, in, 1918, has, been, termed, a, pandemic, era, in, which, all, flu, pandemics, since, its, emergence, have, been, caused, by, its, own, descendants, following, the, first, of, these, post, 1918, pandemics, in, 1957, the, virus, was, totally, displaced, by, the, novel, h2n2, the, reassortant, product, of, the, human, h1n1, and, an, avian, influenza, virus, which, thereafter, became, the, active, influenza, a, virus, in, humans, in, 1977, an, influenza, virus, bearing, a, very, close, resemblance, to, the, seasonal, h1n1, which, had, not, been, seen, since, the, 1950s, appeared, in, russia, and, subsequently, initiated, a, technical, pandemic, that, principally, affected, those, 26, years, of, age, and, younger, while, some, natural, explanations, such, as, the, virus, remaining, in, some, frozen, state, for, 20, years, have, been, proposed, to, explain, this, unprecedented, phenomenon, the, nature, of, influenza, itself, has, been, cited, in, favor, of, human, involvement, of, some, kind, such, as, an, accidental, leak, from, a, lab, where, the, old, virus, had, been, preserved, for, research, purposes, following, this, miniature, pandemic, the, reemerged, h1n1, became, endemic, once, again, but, did, not, displace, the, other, active, influenza, a, virus, h3n2, which, itself, had, displaced, h2n2, through, a, pandemic, in, 1968, for, the, first, time, two, influenza, a, viruses, were, observed, in, cocirculation, this, state, of, affairs, has, persisted, even, after, 2009, when, a, novel, h1n1, virus, emerged, sparked, a, pandemic, and, thereafter, took, the, place, of, the, seasonal, h1n1, to, circulate, alongside, h3n2, despite, its, name, historical, and, epidemiological, data, cannot, identify, the, geographic, origin, of, the, spanish, flu, however, several, theories, have, been, proposed, the, first, confirmed, cases, originated, in, the, united, states, historian, alfred, w, crosby, stated, in, 2003, that, the, flu, originated, in, kansas, and, author, john, m, barry, described, a, january, 1918, outbreak, in, haskell, county, kansas, as, the, point, of, origin, in, his, 2004, article, a, 2018, study, of, tissue, slides, and, medical, reports, led, by, evolutionary, biology, professor, michael, worobey, found, evidence, against, the, disease, originating, from, kansas, as, those, cases, were, milder, and, had, fewer, deaths, compared, to, the, infections, in, new, york, city, in, the, same, period, the, study, did, find, evidence, through, phylogenetic, analyses, that, the, virus, likely, had, a, north, american, origin, though, it, was, not, conclusive, in, addition, the, haemagglutinin, glycoproteins, of, the, virus, suggest, that, it, originated, long, before, 1918, and, other, studies, suggest, that, the, reassortment, of, the, h1n1, virus, likely, occurred, in, or, around, 1915, the, major, u, k, troop, staging, and, hospital, camp, in, taples, in, france, has, been, theorized, by, virologist, john, oxford, as, being, at, the, center, of, the, spanish, flu, his, study, found, that, in, late, 1916, the, taples, camp, was, hit, by, the, onset, of, a, new, disease, with, high, mortality, that, caused, symptoms, similar, to, the, flu, according, to, oxford, a, similar, outbreak, occurred, in, march, 1917, at, army, barracks, in, aldershot, and, military, pathologists, later, recognized, these, early, outbreaks, as, the, same, disease, as, the, spanish, flu, the, overcrowded, camp, and, hospital, at, taples, was, an, ideal, environment, for, the, spread, of, a, respiratory, virus, the, hospital, treated, thousands, of, victims, of, poison, gas, attacks, and, other, casualties, of, war, and, 100, 000, soldiers, passed, through, the, camp, every, day, it, also, was, home, to, a, piggery, and, poultry, was, regularly, brought, in, from, surrounding, villages, to, feed, the, camp, oxford, and, his, team, postulated, that, a, precursor, virus, harbored, in, birds, mutated, and, then, migrated, to, pigs, kept, near, the, front, a, report, published, in, 2016, in, the, journal, of, the, chinese, medical, association, found, evidence, that, the, 1918, virus, had, been, circulating, in, the, european, armies, for, months, and, possibly, years, before, the, 1918, pandemic, political, scientist, andrew, price, smith, published, data, from, the, austrian, archives, suggesting, the, influenza, began, in, austria, in, early, 1917, a, 2009, study, in, influenza, and, other, respiratory, viruses, found, that, spanish, flu, mortality, simultaneously, peaked, within, the, two, month, period, of, october, and, november, 1918, in, all, fourteen, european, countries, analyzed, which, is, inconsistent, with, the, pattern, that, researchers, would, expect, if, the, virus, had, originated, somewhere, in, europe, and, then, spread, outwards, in, 1993, claude, hannoun, the, leading, expert, on, the, spanish, flu, at, the, pasteur, institute, asserted, the, precursor, virus, was, likely, to, have, come, from, china, and, then, mutated, in, the, united, states, near, boston, and, from, there, spread, to, brest, france, europe, s, battlefields, the, rest, of, europe, and, the, rest, of, the, world, with, allied, soldiers, and, sailors, as, the, main, disseminators, hannoun, considered, several, alternative, hypotheses, of, origin, such, as, spain, kansas, and, brest, as, being, possible, but, not, likely, in, 2014, historian, mark, humphries, argued, that, the, mobilization, of, 96, 000, chinese, laborers, to, work, behind, the, british, and, french, lines, might, have, been, the, source, of, the, pandemic, humphries, of, the, memorial, university, of, newfoundland, in, st, john, s, based, his, conclusions, on, newly, unearthed, records, he, found, archival, evidence, that, a, respiratory, illness, that, struck, northern, china, where, the, laborers, came, from, in, november, 1917, was, identified, a, year, later, by, chinese, health, officials, as, identical, to, the, spanish, flu, unfortunately, no, tissue, samples, have, survived, for, modern, comparison, nevertheless, there, were, some, reports, of, respiratory, illness, on, parts, of, the, path, the, laborers, took, to, get, to, europe, which, also, passed, through, north, america, china, was, one, of, the, few, regions, of, the, world, seemingly, less, affected, by, the, spanish, flu, pandemic, where, several, studies, have, documented, a, comparatively, mild, flu, season, in, 1918, although, this, is, disputed, due, to, lack, of, data, during, the, warlord, period, see, around, the, globe, this, has, led, to, speculation, that, the, spanish, flu, pandemic, originated, in, china, as, the, lower, rates, of, flu, mortality, may, be, explained, by, the, chinese, population, s, previously, acquired, immunity, to, the, flu, virus, in, the, guangdong, province, it, was, reported, that, early, outbreaks, of, influenza, in, 1918, disproportionately, impacted, young, men, the, june, outbreak, infected, children, and, adolescents, between, 11, and, 20, years, of, age, while, the, october, outbreak, was, most, common, in, those, aged, 11, to, 15, a, report, published, in, 2016, in, the, journal, of, the, chinese, medical, association, found, no, evidence, that, the, 1918, virus, was, imported, to, europe, via, chinese, and, southeast, asian, soldiers, and, workers, and, instead, found, evidence, of, its, circulation, in, europe, before, the, pandemic, the, 2016, study, found, that, the, low, flu, mortality, rate, an, estimated, one, in, a, thousand, recorded, among, the, chinese, and, southeast, asian, workers, in, europe, suggests, that, the, asian, units, were, not, different, from, other, allied, military, units, in, france, at, the, end, of, 1918, and, thus, were, not, a, likely, source, of, a, new, lethal, virus, further, evidence, against, the, disease, being, spread, by, chinese, workers, was, that, workers, entered, europe, through, other, routes, that, did, not, result, in, a, detectable, spread, making, them, unlikely, to, have, been, the, original, hosts, the, basic, reproduction, number, of, the, virus, was, between, 2, and, 3, the, close, quarters, and, massive, troop, movements, of, world, war, i, hastened, the, pandemic, and, probably, both, increased, transmission, and, augmented, mutation, the, war, may, also, have, reduced, people, s, resistance, to, the, virus, some, speculate, the, soldiers, immune, systems, were, weakened, by, malnourishment, as, well, as, the, stresses, of, combat, and, chemical, attacks, increasing, their, susceptibility, a, large, factor, in, the, worldwide, occurrence, of, the, flu, was, increased, travel, modern, transportation, systems, made, it, easier, for, soldiers, sailors, and, civilian, travelers, to, spread, the, disease, another, was, lies, and, denial, by, governments, leaving, the, population, ill, prepared, to, handle, the, outbreaks, the, severity, of, the, second, wave, has, been, attributed, to, the, circumstances, of, the, first, world, war, in, civilian, life, natural, selection, favors, a, mild, strain, those, who, get, very, ill, stay, home, and, those, mildly, ill, continue, with, their, lives, preferentially, spreading, the, mild, strain, in, the, trenches, natural, selection, was, reversed, soldiers, with, a, mild, strain, stayed, where, they, were, while, the, severely, ill, were, sent, on, crowded, trains, to, crowded, field, hospitals, spreading, the, deadlier, virus, the, second, wave, began, and, the, flu, quickly, spread, around, the, world, again, consequently, during, modern, pandemics, health, officials, look, for, deadlier, strains, of, a, virus, when, it, reaches, places, with, social, upheaval, the, fact, that, most, of, those, who, recovered, from, first, wave, infections, had, become, immune, showed, that, it, must, have, been, the, same, strain, of, flu, this, was, most, dramatically, illustrated, in, copenhagen, which, escaped, with, a, combined, mortality, rate, of, just, 0, 29, 0, 02, in, the, first, wave, and, 0, 27, in, the, second, wave, because, of, exposure, to, the, less, lethal, first, wave, for, the, rest, of, the, population, the, second, wave, was, far, more, deadly, the, most, vulnerable, people, were, those, like, the, soldiers, in, the, trenches, adults, who, were, young, and, fit, after, the, lethal, second, wave, struck, in, late, 1918, new, cases, dropped, abruptly, in, philadelphia, for, example, 4, 597, people, died, in, the, week, ending, 16, october, but, by, 11, november, influenza, had, almost, disappeared, from, the, city, one, explanation, for, the, rapid, decline, in, the, lethality, of, the, disease, is, that, doctors, became, more, effective, in, the, prevention, and, treatment, of, pneumonia, that, developed, after, the, victims, had, contracted, the, virus, however, john, barry, stated, in, his, 2004, book, the, great, influenza, the, epic, story, of, the, deadliest, plague, in, history, that, researchers, have, found, no, evidence, to, support, this, position, another, theory, holds, that, the, 1918, virus, mutated, extremely, rapidly, to, a, less, lethal, strain, such, evolution, of, influenza, is, a, common, occurrence, there, is, a, tendency, for, pathogenic, viruses, to, become, less, lethal, with, time, as, the, hosts, of, more, dangerous, strains, tend, to, die, out, fatal, cases, did, continue, into, 1919, however, one, notable, example, was, that, of, ice, hockey, player, joe, hall, who, while, playing, for, the, montreal, canadiens, fell, victim, to, the, flu, in, april, after, an, outbreak, that, resulted, in, the, cancellation, of, the, 1919, stanley, cup, finals, the, majority, of, the, infected, experienced, only, the, typical, flu, symptoms, of, sore, throat, headache, and, fever, especially, during, the, first, wave, however, during, the, second, wave, the, disease, was, much, more, serious, often, complicated, by, bacterial, pneumonia, which, was, often, the, cause, of, death, this, more, serious, type, would, cause, heliotrope, cyanosis, to, develop, whereby, the, skin, would, first, develop, two, mahogany, spots, over, the, cheekbones, which, would, then, over, a, few, hours, spread, to, color, the, entire, face, blue, followed, by, black, coloration, first, in, the, extremities, and, then, further, spreading, to, the, limbs, and, the, torso, after, this, death, would, follow, within, hours, or, days, due, to, the, lungs, being, filled, with, fluids, other, signs, and, symptoms, reported, included, spontaneous, mouth, and, nosebleeds, miscarriages, for, pregnant, women, a, peculiar, smell, teeth, and, hair, falling, out, delirium, dizziness, insomnia, loss, of, hearing, or, smell, and, impaired, vision, one, observer, wrote, one, of, the, most, striking, of, the, complications, was, hemorrhage, from, mucous, membranes, especially, from, the, nose, stomach, and, intestine, bleeding, from, the, ears, and, petechial, hemorrhages, in, the, skin, also, occurred, the, majority, of, deaths, were, from, bacterial, pneumonia, a, common, secondary, infection, associated, with, influenza, this, pneumonia, was, itself, caused, by, common, upper, respiratory, tract, bacteria, which, were, able, to, get, into, the, lungs, via, the, damaged, bronchial, tubes, of, the, victims, the, virus, also, killed, people, directly, by, causing, massive, hemorrhages, and, edema, in, the, lungs, modern, analysis, has, shown, the, virus, to, be, particularly, deadly, because, in, animal, trials, it, triggers, an, overreaction, of, the, body, s, immune, system, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, cytokine, storm, the, strong, immune, reactions, of, young, adults, were, postulated, to, have, ravaged, the, body, whereas, the, weaker, immune, reactions, of, children, and, middle, aged, adults, resulted, in, fewer, deaths, among, those, groups, because, the, virus, that, caused, the, disease, was, too, small, to, be, seen, under, a, microscope, at, the, time, there, were, problems, with, correctly, diagnosing, it, the, bacterium, haemophilus, influenzae, was, instead, mistakenly, thought, to, be, the, cause, as, it, was, big, enough, to, be, seen, and, was, present, in, many, though, not, all, patients, for, this, reason, a, vaccine, that, was, used, against, that, bacillus, did, not, make, an, infection, rarer, but, did, decrease, the, death, rate, during, the, deadly, second, wave, there, were, also, fears, that, it, was, in, fact, plague, dengue, fever, or, cholera, another, common, misdiagnosis, was, typhus, which, was, common, in, circumstances, of, social, upheaval, and, was, therefore, also, affecting, russia, in, the, aftermath, of, the, october, revolution, in, chile, the, view, of, the, country, s, elite, was, that, the, nation, was, in, severe, decline, and, therefore, doctors, assumed, that, the, disease, was, typhus, caused, by, poor, hygiene, and, not, an, infectious, one, causing, a, mismanaged, response, which, did, not, ban, mass, gatherings, studies, have, shown, that, the, immune, system, of, spanish, flu, victims, could, have, been, weakened, by, adverse, climate, conditions, which, were, particularly, unseasonably, cold, and, wet, for, extended, periods, of, time, during, the, duration, of, the, pandemic, this, affected, especially, wwi, troops, exposed, to, incessant, rains, and, lower, than, average, temperatures, for, the, duration, of, the, conflict, and, especially, during, the, second, wave, of, the, pandemic, ultra, high, resolution, climate, data, combined, with, highly, detailed, mortality, records, analyzed, at, harvard, university, and, the, climate, change, institute, at, the, university, of, maine, identified, a, severe, climate, anomaly, that, impacted, europe, from, 1914, to, 1919, with, several, environmental, indicators, directly, influencing, the, severity, and, spread, of, the, spanish, flu, pandemic, specifically, a, significant, increase, in, precipitation, affected, all, of, europe, during, the, second, wave, of, the, pandemic, from, september, to, december, 1918, mortality, figures, follow, closely, the, concurrent, increase, in, precipitation, and, decrease, in, temperatures, several, explanations, have, been, proposed, for, this, including, the, fact, that, lower, temperatures, and, increased, precipitation, provided, ideal, conditions, for, virus, replication, and, transmission, while, also, negatively, affecting, the, immune, systems, of, soldiers, and, other, people, exposed, to, the, inclement, weather, a, factor, proven, to, increase, likelihood, of, infection, by, both, viruses, and, pneumococcal, co, morbid, infections, documented, to, have, affected, a, large, percentage, of, pandemic, victims, one, fifth, of, them, with, a, 36, mortality, rate, a, six, year, climate, anomaly, 1914, 1919, brought, cold, marine, air, to, europe, drastically, changing, its, weather, as, documented, by, eyewitness, accounts, and, instrumental, records, reaching, as, far, as, the, gallipoli, campaign, in, turkey, where, anzac, troops, suffered, extremely, cold, temperatures, despite, the, normally, mediterranean, climate, of, the, region, the, climate, anomaly, likely, influenced, the, migration, of, h1n1, avian, vectors, which, contaminate, bodies, of, water, with, their, droppings, reaching, 60, infection, rates, in, autumn, the, climate, anomaly, has, been, associated, with, an, anthropogenic, increase, in, atmospheric, dust, due, to, the, incessant, bombardment, increased, nucleation, due, to, dust, particles, cloud, condensation, nuclei, contributed, to, increased, precipitation, while, systems, for, alerting, public, health, authorities, of, infectious, spread, did, exist, in, 1918, they, did, not, generally, include, influenza, leading, to, a, delayed, response, nevertheless, actions, were, taken, maritime, quarantines, were, declared, on, islands, such, as, iceland, australia, and, american, samoa, saving, many, lives, social, distancing, measures, were, introduced, for, example, closing, schools, theatres, and, places, of, worship, limiting, public, transportation, and, banning, mass, gatherings, wearing, face, masks, became, common, in, some, places, such, as, japan, though, there, were, debates, over, their, efficacy, there, was, also, some, resistance, to, their, use, as, exemplified, by, the, anti, mask, league, of, san, francisco, vaccines, were, also, developed, but, as, these, were, based, on, bacteria, and, not, the, actual, virus, they, could, only, help, with, secondary, infections, the, actual, enforcement, of, various, restrictions, varied, to, a, large, extent, the, new, york, city, health, commissioner, ordered, businesses, to, open, and, close, on, staggered, shifts, to, avoid, overcrowding, on, the, subways, a, later, study, found, that, measures, such, as, banning, mass, gatherings, and, requiring, the, wearing, of, face, masks, could, cut, the, death, rate, up, to, 50, percent, but, this, was, dependent, on, their, being, imposed, early, in, the, outbreak, and, not, being, lifted, prematurely, as, there, were, no, antiviral, drugs, to, treat, the, virus, and, no, antibiotics, to, treat, the, secondary, bacterial, infections, doctors, would, rely, on, a, random, assortment, of, medicines, with, varying, degrees, of, effectiveness, such, as, aspirin, quinine, arsenics, digitalis, strychnine, epsom, salts, castor, oil, and, iodine, treatments, of, traditional, medicine, such, as, bloodletting, ayurveda, and, kampo, were, also, applied, due, to, world, war, i, many, countries, engaged, in, wartime, censorship, and, suppressed, reporting, of, the, pandemic, for, example, the, italian, newspaper, corriere, della, sera, was, prohibited, from, reporting, daily, death, tolls, the, newspapers, of, the, time, were, also, generally, paternalistic, and, worried, about, mass, panic, misinformation, also, spread, along, with, the, disease, in, ireland, there, was, a, belief, that, noxious, gases, were, rising, from, the, mass, graves, of, flanders, fields, and, being, blown, all, over, the, world, by, winds, there, were, also, rumors, that, the, germans, were, behind, it, for, example, by, poisoning, the, aspirin, manufactured, by, bayer, or, by, releasing, poison, gas, from, u, boats, the, spanish, flu, infected, around, 500, million, people, about, one, third, of, the, world, s, population, estimates, as, to, how, many, infected, people, died, vary, greatly, but, the, flu, is, regardless, considered, to, be, one, of, the, deadliest, pandemics, in, history, an, early, estimate, from, 1927, put, global, mortality, at, 21, 6, million, an, estimate, from, 1991, states, that, the, virus, killed, between, 25, and, 39, million, people, a, 2005, estimate, put, the, death, toll, at, 50, million, about, 3, of, the, global, population, and, possibly, as, high, as, 100, million, more, than, 5, however, a, 2018, reassessment, in, the, american, journal, of, epidemiology, estimated, the, total, to, be, about, 17, million, though, this, has, been, contested, with, a, world, population, of, 1, 8, to, 1, 9, billion, these, estimates, correspond, to, between, 1, and, 6, percent, of, the, population, estimates, done, in, 2021, by, john, m, barry, have, the, total, death, toll, alone, at, well, above, 100, million, a, 2009, study, in, influenza, and, other, respiratory, viruses, based, on, data, from, fourteen, european, countries, estimated, a, total, of, 2, 64, million, excess, deaths, in, europe, attributable, to, the, spanish, flu, during, the, major, 1918, 1919, phase, of, the, pandemic, in, line, with, the, three, prior, studies, from, 1991, 2002, and, 2006, that, calculated, a, european, death, toll, of, between, 2, million, and, 2, 3, million, this, represents, a, mortality, rate, of, about, 1, 1, of, the, european, population, c, 250, million, in, 1918, considerably, higher, than, the, mortality, rate, in, the, u, s, which, the, authors, hypothesize, is, likely, due, to, the, severe, effects, of, the, war, in, europe, the, excess, mortality, rate, in, the, u, k, has, been, estimated, at, 0, 28, 0, 4, far, below, this, european, average, some, 12, 17, million, people, died, in, india, about, 5, of, the, population, the, death, toll, in, india, s, british, ruled, districts, was, 13, 88, million, another, estimate, gives, at, least, 12, million, dead, the, decade, between, 1911, and, 1921, was, the, only, census, period, in, which, india, s, population, fell, mostly, due, to, devastation, of, the, spanish, flu, pandemic, while, india, is, generally, described, as, the, country, most, severely, affected, by, the, spanish, flu, at, least, one, study, argues, that, other, factors, may, partially, account, for, the, very, high, excess, mortality, rates, observed, in, 1918, citing, unusually, high, 1917, mortality, and, wide, regional, variation, ranging, from, 0, 47, to, 6, 66, a, 2006, study, in, the, lancet, also, noted, that, indian, provinces, had, excess, mortality, rates, ranging, from, 2, 1, to, 7, 8, stating, commentators, at, the, time, attributed, this, huge, variation, to, differences, in, nutritional, status, and, diurnal, fluctuations, in, temperature, in, finland, 20, 000, died, out, of, 210, 000, infected, in, sweden, 34, 000,

rate, 2, 7, per, 1, 000, people, was, one, of, the, lowest, recorded, compared, with, other, countries, at, the, time, however, as, much, as, 40, percent, of, the, population, were, infected, and, a, mortality, rate, of, 50, percent, was, recorded, by, some, aboriginal, communities, new, south, wales, and, victoria, saw, the, greatest, relative, mortality, with, 3, 19, and, 2, 40, deaths, per, 1, 000, people, respectively, while, western, australia, queensland, southern, australia, and, tasmania, experienced, rates, of, 1, 70, 1, 14, 1, 13, and, 1, 09, per, 1, 000, respectively, in, queensland, at, least, one, third, of, deaths, recorded, were, in, the, aboriginal, population, in, the, u, s, about, 28, of, the, population, of, 105, million, became, infected, and, 500, 000, to,

of, ethiopia, was, one, of, the, first, ethiopians, who, contracted, influenza, but, survived, many, of, his, subjects, did, not, estimates, for, fatalities, in, the, capital, city, addis, ababa, range, from, 5, 000, to, 10, 000, or, higher, the, death, toll, in, russia, has, been, estimated, at, 450, 000, though, the, epidemiologists, who, suggested, this, number, called, it, a, shot, in, the, dark, if, it, is, correct, russia, lost, roughly, 0, 4, of, its, population, meaning, it, suffered, the, lowest, influenza, related, mortality, in, europe, another, study, considers, this, number, unlikely, given, that, the, country, was, in, the, grip, of, a, civil, war, and, the, infrastructure, of, daily, life, had, broken, down, the, study, suggests, that, russia, s, death, toll, was, closer, to, 2, or, 2, 7, million, people, even, in, areas, where, mortality, was, low, so, many, adults, were, incapacitated, that, much, of, everyday, life, was, hampered, some, communities, closed, all, stores, or, required, customers, to, leave, orders, outside, there, were, reports, that, healthcare, workers, could, not, tend, the, sick, nor, the, gravediggers, bury, the, dead, because, they, too, were, ill, mass, graves, were, dug, by, steam, shovel, and, bodies, buried, without, coffins, in, many, places, bristol, bay, a, region, of, alaska, populated, by, indigenous,

between, 1918, and, 1919, but, the, flu, at, last, reached, the, town, in, spring, 1920, reports, suggested, that, during, the, first, two, weeks, of, may, the, majority, of, the, town, s, population, became, infected, 10, of, the, population, were, estimated, to, have, died, most, of, whom, were, alaska, natives, several, pacific, island, territories, were, hit, particularly, hard, the, pandemic, reached, them, from, new, zealand, which, was, too, slow, to, implement, measures, to, prevent, ships, such, as, talune, carrying, the, flu, from, leaving, its, ports, from, new, zealand, the, flu, reached, tonga, killing, 8, of, the, population, nauru, 16, and, fiji, 5, 9, 000, people, worst, affected, was, western, samoa, formerly, german, samoa, which, had, been, occupied, by, new, zealand, in, 1914, 90, of, the, population, was, infected, 30, of, adult, men, 22, of, adult, women, and, 10, of, children, died, by, contrast, governor, john, martin, poyer, prevented, the, flu, from, reaching, neighboring, american, samoa, by, imposing, a, blockade, the, disease, spread, fastest, through, the, higher, social, classes, among, the, indigenous, peoples, because, of, the, custom, of, gathering, oral, tradition, from, chiefs, on, their, deathbeds, many, community, elders, were, infected, through, this, process, in, iran, the, mortality, was, very, high, according, to, an, estimate, between, 902, 400, and, 2, 431, 000, or, 8, to, 22, of, the, total, population, died, the, country, was, going, through, the, persian, famine, of, 1917, 1919, concurrently, in, ireland, during, the, worst, 12, months, the, spanish, flu, accounted, for, one, third, of, all, deaths, in, south, africa, it, is, estimated, that, about, 300, 000, people, amounting, to, 6, of, the, population, died, within, six, weeks, government, actions, in, the, early, stages, of, the, virus, arrival, in, the, country, in, september, 1918, are, believed, to, have, unintentionally, accelerated, its, spread, throughout, the, country, almost, a, quarter, of, the, working, population, of, kimberley, consisting, of, workers, in, the, diamond, mines, died, in, british, somaliland, one, official, estimated, that, 7, of, the, native, population, died, this, huge, death, toll, resulted, from, an, extremely, high, infection, rate, of, up, to, 50, and, the, extreme, severity, of, the, symptoms, in, the, pacific, american, samoa, and, the, french, colony, of, new, caledonia, succeeded, in, preventing, even, a, single, death, from, influenza, through, effective, quarantines, however, the, outbreak, was, delayed, into, 1926, for, american, samoa, and, 1921, for, new, caledonia, as, the, quarantine, period, ended, on, american, samoa, at, least, 25, of, the, island, residents, were, clinically, attacked, and, 0, 1, died, and, on, new, caledonia, there, was, widespread, illness, and, 0, 1, population, died, australia, also, managed, to, avoid, the, first, two, waves, with, a, quarantine, iceland, protected, a, third, of, its, population, from, exposure, by, blocking, the, main, road, of, the, island, by, the, end, of, the, pandemic, the, isolated, island, of, maraj, in, brazil, s, amazon, river, delta, had, not, reported, an, outbreak, saint, helena, also, reported, no, deaths, estimates, for, the, death, toll, in, china, have, varied, widely, a, range, which, reflects, the, lack, of, centralized, collection, of, health, data, at, the, time, due, to, the, warlord, period, china, may, have, experienced, a, relatively, mild, flu, season, in, 1918, compared, to, other, areas, of, the, world, however, some, reports, from, its, interior, suggest, that, mortality, rates, from, influenza, were, perhaps, higher, in, at, least, a, few, locations, in, china, in, 1918, at, the, very, least, there, is, little, evidence, that, china, as, a, whole, was, seriously, affected, by, the, flu, compared, to, other, countries, in, the, world, the, first, estimate, of, the, chinese, death, toll, was, made, in, 1991, by, patterson, and, pyle, which, estimated, a, toll, of, between, 5, and, 9, million, however, this, 1991, study, was, criticized, by, later, studies, due, to, flawed, methodology, and, newer, studies, have, published, estimates, of, a, far, lower, mortality, rate, in, china, for, instance, iijima, in, 1998, estimates, the, death, toll, in, china, to, be, between, 1, and, 1, 28, million, based, on, data, available, from, chinese, port, cities, the, lower, estimates, of, the, chinese, death, toll, are, based, on, the, low, mortality, rates, that, were, found, in, chinese, port, cities, for, example, hong, kong, and, on, the, assumption, that, poor, communications, prevented, the, flu, from, penetrating, the, interior, of, china, however, some, contemporary, newspaper, and, post, office, reports, as, well, as, reports, from, missionary, doctors, suggest, that, the, flu, did, penetrate, the, chinese, interior, and, that, influenza, was, severe, in, at, least, some, locations, in, the, countryside, of, china, although, medical, records, from, china, s, interior, are, lacking, extensive, medical, data, were, recorded, in, chinese, port, cities, such, as, then, british, controlled, hong, kong, canton, peking, harbin, and, shanghai, these, data, were, collected, by, the, chinese, maritime, customs, service, which, was, largely, staffed, by, non, chinese, foreigners, such, as, the, british, french, and, other, european, colonial, officials, in, china, as, a, whole, data, from, china, s, port, cities, show, low, mortality, rates, compared, to, other, cities, in, asia, for, example, the, british, authorities, at, hong, kong, and, canton, reported, a, mortality, rate, from, influenza, at, a, rate, of, 0, 25, and, 0, 32, much, lower, than, the, reported, mortality, rate, of, other, cities, in, asia, such, as, calcutta, or, bombay, where, influenza, was, much, more, devastating, similarly, in, the, city, of, shanghai, which, had, a, population, of, over, 2, million, in, 1918, there, were, only, 266, recorded, deaths, from, influenza, among, the, chinese, population, in, 1918, if, extrapolated, from, the, extensive, data, recorded, from, chinese, cities, the, suggested, mortality, rate, from, influenza, in, china, as, a, whole, in, 1918, was, likely, lower, than, 1, much, lower, than, the, world, average, which, was, around, 3, 5, in, contrast, japan, and, taiwan, had, reported, a, mortality, rate, from, influenza, around, 0, 45, and, 0, 69, respectively, higher, than, the, mortality, rate, collected, from, data, in, chinese, port, cities, such, as, hong, kong, 0, 25, canton, 0, 32, and, shanghai, however, it, is, noted, that, the, influenza, mortality, rate, in, hong, kong, and, canton, are, under, recorded, because, only, the, deaths, that, occurred, in, colony, hospitals, were, counted, similarly, in, shanghai, these, statistics, are, limited, to, that, area, of, the, city, under, the, control, of, the, health, section, of, the, shanghai, international, settlement, and, the, actual, death, toll, in, shanghai, was, much, higher, the, medical, records, from, china, s, interior, indicate, that, compared, to, cities, rural, communities, have, substantially, higher, mortality, rate, a, published, influenza, survey, in, houlu, county, hebei, province, found, that, the, case, fatality, rate, was, 9, 77, and, 0, 79, of, county, population, died, from, influenza, in, october, and, november, 1918, the, pandemic, mostly, killed, young, adults, in, 1918, 1919, 99, of, pandemic, influenza, deaths, in, the, u, s, occurred, in, people, under, 65, and, nearly, half, of, deaths, were, in, young, adults, 20, to, 40, years, old, in, 1920, the, mortality, rate, among, people, under, 65, had, decreased, sixfold, to, half, the, mortality, rate, of, people, over, 65, but, 92, of, deaths, still, occurred, in, people, under, 65, this, is, unusual, since, influenza, is, typically, most, deadly, to, weak, individuals, such, as, infants, under, age, two, adults, over, age, 70, and, the, immunocompromised, in, 1918, older, adults, may, have, had, partial, protection, caused, by, exposure, to, the, 1889, 1890, flu, pandemic, known, as, the, russian, flu, according, to, historian, john, m, barry, the, most, vulnerable, of, all, those, most, likely, of, the, most, likely, to, die, were, pregnant, women, he, reported, that, in, thirteen, studies, of, hospitalized, women, in, the, pandemic, the, death, rate, ranged, from, 23, to, 71, of, the, pregnant, women, who, survived, childbirth, over, one, quarter, 26, lost, the, child, another, oddity, was, that, the, outbreak, was, widespread, in, the, summer, and, autumn, in, the, northern, hemisphere, influenza, is, usually, worse, in, winter, there, were, also, geographic, patterns, to, the, disease, s, fatality, some, parts, of, asia, had, 30, times, higher, death, rates, than, some, parts, of, europe, and, generally, africa, and, asia, had, higher, rates, while, europe, and, north, america, had, lower, ones, there, was, also, great, variation, within, continents, with, three, times, higher, mortality, in, hungary, and, spain, compared, to, denmark, two, to, three, times, higher, chance, of, death, in, sub, saharan, africa, compared, to, north, africa, and, possibly, up, to, ten, times, higher, rates, between, the, extremes, of, asia, cities, were, affected, worse, than, rural, areas, there, were, also, differences, between, cities, which, might, have, reflected, exposure, to, the, milder, first, wave, giving, immunity, as, well, as, the, introduction, of, social, distancing, measures, another, major, pattern, was, the, differences, between, social, classes, in, oslo, death, rates, were, inversely, correlated, with, apartment, size, as, the, poorer, people, living, in, smaller, apartments, died, at, a, higher, rate, social, status, was, also, reflected, in, the, higher, mortality, among, immigrant, communities, with, italian, americans, a, recently, arrived, group, at, the, time, were, nearly, twice, as, likely, to, die, compared, to, the, average, americans, these, disparities, reflected, worse, diets, crowded, living, conditions, and, problems, accessing, healthcare, paradoxically, however, african, americans, were, relatively, spared, by, the, pandemic, more, men, than, women, were, killed, by, the, flu, as, they, were, more, likely, to, go, out, and, be, exposed, while, women, would, tend, to, stay, at, home, for, the, same, reason, men, also, were, more, likely, to, have, pre, existing, tuberculosis, which, severely, worsened, the, chances, of, recovery, however, in, india, the, opposite, was, true, potentially, because, indian, women, were, neglected, with, poorer, nutrition, and, were, expected, to, care, for, the, sick, a, study, conducted, by, he, et, al, 2011, used, a, mechanistic, modeling, approach, to, study, the, three, waves, of, the, 1918, influenza, pandemic, they, examined, the, factors, that, underlie, variability, in, temporal, patterns, and, their, correlation, to, patterns, of, mortality, and, morbidity, their, analysis, suggests, that, temporal, variations, in, transmission, rate, provide, the, best, explanation, and, the, variation, in, transmission, required, to, generate, these, three, waves, is, within, biologically, plausible, values, another, study, by, he, et, al, 2013, used, a, simple, epidemic, model, incorporating, three, factors, to, infer, the, cause, of, the, three, waves, of, the, 1918, influenza, pandemic, these, factors, were, school, opening, and, closing, temperature, changes, throughout, the, outbreak, and, human, behavioral, changes, in, response, to, the, outbreak, their, modeling, results, showed, that, all, three, factors, are, important, but, human, behavioral, responses, showed, the, most, significant, effects, academic, andrew, price, smith, has, made, the, argument, that, the, virus, helped, tip, the, balance, of, power, in, the, latter, days, of, the, war, towards, the, allied, cause, he, provides, data, that, the, viral, waves, hit, the, central, powers, before, the, allied, powers, and, that, both, morbidity, and, mortality, in, germany, and, austria, were, considerably, higher, than, in, britain, and, france, a, 2006, lancet, study, corroborates, higher, excess, mortality, rates, in, germany, 0, 76, and, austria, 1, 61, compared, to, britain, 0, 34, and, france, 0, 75, kenneth, kahn, at, oxford, university, computing, services, writes, that, many, researchers, have, suggested, that, the, conditions, of, the, war, significantly, aided, the, spread, of, the, disease, and, others, have, argued, that, the, course, of, the, war, and, subsequent, peace, treaty, was, influenced, by, the, pandemic, kahn, has, developed, a, model, that, can, be, used, on, home, computers, to, test, these, theories, many, businesses, in, the, entertainment, and, service, industries, suffered, losses, in, revenue, while, the, healthcare, industry, reported, profit, gains, historian, nancy, bristow, has, argued, that, the, pandemic, when, combined, with, the, increasing, number, of, women, attending, college, contributed, to, the, success, of, women, in, the, field, of, nursing, this, was, due, in, part, to, the, failure, of, medical, doctors, who, were, predominantly, men, to, contain, and, prevent, the, illness, nursing, staff, who, were, mainly, women, celebrated, the, success, of, their, patient, care, and, did, not, associate, the, spread, of, the, disease, with, their, work, a, 2020, study, found, that, u, s, cities, that, implemented, early, and, extensive, non, medical, measures, quarantine, etc, suffered, no, additional, adverse, economic, effects, due, to, implementing, those, measures, however, the, validity, of, this, study, has, been, questioned, because, of, the, coincidence, of, wwi, and, other, problems, with, data, reliability, a, 2006, study, in, the, journal, of, political, economy, found, that, cohorts, in, utero, during, the, pandemic, displayed, reduced, educational, attainment, increased, rates, of, physical, disability, lower, income, lower, socioeconomic, status, and, higher, transfer, payments, received, compared, with, other, birth, cohorts, a, 2018, study, found, that, the, pandemic, reduced, educational, attainment, in, populations, the, flu, has, also, been, linked, to, the, outbreak, of, encephalitis, lethargica, in, the, 1920s, survivors, faced, an, elevated, mortality, risk, some, survivors, did, not, fully, recover, from, physiological, conditions, resulting, from, infection, despite, the, high, morbidity, and, mortality, rates, that, resulted, from, the, epidemic, the, spanish, flu, began, to, fade, from, public, awareness, over, the, decades, until, the, arrival, of, news, about, bird, flu, and, other, pandemics, in, the, 1990s, and, 2000s, this, has, led, some, historians, to, label, the, spanish, flu, a, forgotten, pandemic, however, this, label, has, been, challenged, by, the, historian, guy, beiner, who, has, charted, a, complex, history, of, social, and, cultural, forgetting, demonstrating, how, the, pandemic, was, overshadowed, by, the, commemoration, of, the, first, world, war, and, mostly, neglected, in, mainstream, historiography, yet, was, remembered, in, private, and, local, traditions, across, the, globe, there, are, various, theories, of, why, the, spanish, flu, was, forgotten, the, rapid, pace, of, the, pandemic, which, killed, most, of, its, victims, in, the, united, states, within, less, than, nine, months, resulted, in, limited, media, coverage, the, general, population, was, familiar, with, patterns, of, pandemic, disease, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, typhoid, yellow, fever, diphtheria, and, cholera, all, occurred, near, the, same, time, these, outbreaks, probably, lessened, the, significance, of, the, influenza, pandemic, for, the, public, in, some, areas, the, flu, was, not, reported, on, the, only, mention, being, that, of, advertisements, for, medicines, claiming, to, cure, it, additionally, the, outbreak, coincided, with, the, deaths, and, media, focus, on, the, first, world, war, another, explanation, involves, the, age, group, affected, by, the, disease, the, majority, of, fatalities, from, both, the, war, and, the, epidemic, were, among, young, adults, the, high, number, of, war, related, deaths, of, young, adults, may, have, overshadowed, the, deaths, caused, by, flu, when, people, read, the, obituaries, they, saw, the, war, or, postwar, deaths, and, the, deaths, from, the, influenza, side, by, side, particularly, in, europe, where, the, war, s, toll, was, high, the, flu, may, not, have, had, a, tremendous, psychological, impact, or, may, have, seemed, an, extension, of, the, war, s, tragedies, the, duration, of, the, pandemic, and, the, war, could, have, also, played, a, role, the, war, however, had, initially, been, expected, to, end, quickly, but, lasted, for, four, years, by, the, time, the, pandemic, struck, despite, the, toll, of, the, pandemic, it, was, never, a, large, theme, in, american, literature, alfred, crosby, suspects, that, it, may, be, due, to, the, fact, that, it, occurred, after, world, war, i, which, was, the, most, important, event, in, that, generation, s, lives, katherine, anne, porter, s, 1939, novella, pale, horse, pale, rider, is, one, of, the, most, well, known, fictional, accounts, of, the, pandemic, the, 2006, novel, the, last, town, on, earth, focuses, on, a, town, which, attempts, to, limit, the, spread, of, the, flu, by, preventing, people, from, entering, or, leaving, the, pull, of, the, stars, is, a, 2020, novel, by, emma, donoghue, set, in, dublin, during, the, spanish, flu, its, final, draft, was, submitted, in, march, 2020, and, publishers, fast, tracked, publication, because, of, the, then, ongoing, covid, 19, pandemic, the, spanish, flu, killed, a, much, lower, percentage, of, the, world, s, population, than, the, black, death, which, lasted, for, many, more, years, the, recent, covid, 19, pandemic, is, estimated, to, have, killed, 17, 5, 31, 4, million, the, origin, of, the, spanish, flu, pandemic, and, the, relationship, between, the, near, simultaneous, outbreaks, in, humans, and, swine, have, been, controversial, one, hypothesis, is, that, the, virus, strain, originated, at, fort, riley, kansas, in, viruses, in, poultry, and, swine, which, the, fort, bred, for, food, the, soldiers, were, then, sent, from, fort, riley, around, the, world, where, they, spread, the, disease, similarities, between, a, reconstruction, of, the, virus, and, avian, viruses, combined, with, the, human, pandemic, preceding, the, first, reports, of, influenza, in, swine, led, researchers, to, conclude, the, influenza, virus, jumped, directly, from, birds, to, humans, and, swine, caught, the, disease, from, humans, others, have, disagreed, and, more, recent, research, has, suggested, the, strain, may, have, originated, in, a, nonhuman, mammalian, species, an, estimated, date, for, its, appearance, in, mammalian, hosts, has, been, put, at, the, period, 1882, 1913, this, ancestor, virus, diverged, about, 1913, 1915, into, two, clades, or, biological, groups, each, descended, from, a, common, ancestor, which, gave, rise, to, the, classical, swine, and, human, h1n1, influenza, lineages, the, last, common, ancestor, of, human, strains, dates, between, february, 1917, and, april, 1918, because, pigs, are, more, readily, infected, with, avian, influenza, viruses, than, are, humans, they, were, suggested, as, the, original, recipients, of, the, virus, passing, the, virus, to, humans, sometime, between, 1913, and, 1918, an, effort, to, recreate, the, spanish, flu, strain, a, strain, of, influenza, a, subtype, h1n1, was, a, collaboration, among, the, armed, forces, institute, of, pathology, the, usda, ars, southeast, poultry, research, laboratory, and, mount, sinai, school, of, medicine, in, new, york, city, the, effort, resulted, in, the, announcement, on, 5, october, 2005, that, the, group, had, successfully, determined, the, virus, genetic, sequence, using, historic, tissue, samples, recovered, by, pathologist, johan, hultin, from, an, inuit, female, flu, victim, buried, in, the, alaskan, permafrost, and, samples, preserved, from, american, soldiers, roscoe, vaughan, and, james, downs, this, enabled, researchers, at, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, cdc, and, the, mount, sinai, school, of, medicine, led, by, dr, terrence, tumpey, to, synthesize, rna, segments, from, the, h1n1, virus, and, ultimately, reconstruct, infective, virus, particles, these, were, subsequently, used, to, experimentally, infect, mice, ferrets, and, macaques, giving, valuable, insights, into, influenza, virus, biology, and, pathogenesis, providing, important, information, about, how, to, prevent, and, control, future, pandemics, on, 18, january, 2007, kobasa, et, al, 2007, reported, that, monkeys, macaca, fascicularis, infected, with, the, recreated, flu, strain, exhibited, classic, symptoms, of, the, 1918, pandemic, and, died, from, an, overreaction, of, the, immune, system, this, may, explain, why, the, spanish, flu, had, its, surprising, effect, on, younger, healthier, people, as, a, person, with, a, stronger, immune, system, would, potentially, have, a, stronger, overreaction, in, december, 2008, research, by, yoshihiro, kawaoka, of, the, university, of, wisconsin, linked, the, presence, of, three, specific, genes, termed, pa, pb1, and, pb2, and, a, nucleoprotein, derived, from, spanish, flu, samples, to, the, ability, of, the, 1918, flu, virus, to, invade, the, lungs, and, cause, pneumonia, these, genes, were, inserted, into, a, modern, h1n1, strain, and, triggered, similar, symptoms, in, animal, testing, in, 2008, an, investigation, used, the, virus, sequence, to, obtain, the, hemagglutinin, ha, antigen, and, observe, the, adaptive, immunity, in, 32, survivors, of, the, 1918, flu, pandemic, all, of, them, presented, seroreactivity, and, 7, of, 8, further, tested, presented, memory, b, cells, able, to, produce, antibodies, that, bound, to, the, ha, antigen, highlighting, the, ability, of, the, immunological, memory, many, decades, after, in, june, 2010, a, team, at, the, mount, sinai, school, of, medicine, reported, the, 2009, flu, pandemic, vaccine, provided, some, cross, protection, against, the, spanish, flu, pandemic, strain, one, of, the, few, things, known, for, certain, about, influenza, in, 1918, and, for, some, years, after, was, that, it, was, except, in, the, laboratory, exclusively, a, disease, of, human, beings, in, 2013, the, air, worldwide, research, and, modeling, group, characterized, the, historic, 1918, pandemic, and, estimated, the, effects, of, a, similar, pandemic, occurring, today, using, the, air, pandemic, flu, model, in, the, model, a, modern, day, spanish, flu, event, would, result, in, additional, life, insurance, losses, of, between, us, 15, 3, 27, 8, billion, in, the, united, states, alone, with, 188, 000, 337, 000, deaths, in, the, united, states, in, 2018, michael, worobey, an, evolutionary, biology, professor, at, the, university, of, arizona, who, is, examining, the, history, of, the, 1918, pandemic, revealed, that, he, obtained, tissue, slides, created, by, william, rolland, a, physician, who, reported, on, a, respiratory, illness, likely, to, be, the, virus, while, a, pathologist, in, the, british, military, during, world, war, one, rolland, had, authored, an, article, in, the, lancet, during, 1917, about, a, respiratory, illness, outbreak, beginning, in, 1916, in, taples, france, worobey, traced, recent, references, to, that, article, to, family, members, who, had, retained, slides, that, rolland, had, prepared, during, that, time, worobey, extracted, tissue, from, the, slides, to, potentially, reveal, more, about, the, origin, of, the, pathogen, the, high, mortality, rate, of, the, influenza, pandemic, is, one, aspect, that, sets, the, pandemic, apart, from, other, disease, outbreaks, another, factor, is, the, higher, mortality, rate, of, men, compared, with, women, men, with, an, underlying, condition, were, at, significantly, more, risk, tuberculosis, was, one, of, the, deadliest, diseases, in, the, 1900s, and, killed, more, men, than, women, but, with, the, spread, of, influenza, disease, the, cases, of, tuberculosis, cases, in, men, decreased, many, scholars, have, noted, that, tuberculosis, increased, the, mortality, rate, of, influenza, in, males, decreasing, their, life, expectancy, during, the, 1900s, tuberculosis, was, more, common, in, males, than, females, but, studies, show, that, when, influenza, spread, the, tuberculosis, mortality, rate, among, females, changed, the, death, rate, of, tuberculosis, in, females, increased, significantly, and, would, continue, to, decline, until, post, pandemic, death, rates, were, particularly, high, in, those, aged, 20, 35, the, only, comparable, disease, to, this, was, the, black, death, or, bubonic, plague, in, the, 1300s, as, other, studies, have, shown, tuberculosis, and, influenza, had, comorbidities, and, one, affected, the, other, the, ages, of, males, dying, of, the, flu, show, that, tuberculosis, was, a, factor, and, as, males, primarily, had, this, disease, at, the, time, of, the, pandemic, they, had, a, higher, mortality, rate, life, expectancy, dropped, in, males, during, the, pandemic, but, then, increased, two, years, after, the, pandemic, one, major, cause, of, the, spread, of, influenza, was, social, behavior, men, had, more, social, variation, and, were, mobile, more, than, women, due, to, their, work, even, though, there, was, a, higher, mortality, rate, in, males, each, region, showed, different, results, due, to, such, factors, as, nutritional, deficiency, in, newfoundland, the, pandemic, spread, was, highly, variable, influenza, did, not, discriminate, who, was, infected, indeed, it, attacked, the, socioeconomic, status, of, people, although, social, variability, allowed, the, disease, to, move, quickly, geographically, it, tended, to, spread, faster, and, affect, men, more, than, women, due, to, labor, and, social, contact, newfoundland, s, leading, cause, of, death, before, the, pandemic, was, tuberculosis, and, this, is, known, to, be, a, severe, underlying, condition, for, people, and, increases, the, mortality, rate, when, infected, by, the, influenza, disease, there, was, diverse, labor, in, newfoundland, men, and, women, had, various, occupations, that, involved, day, to, day, interaction, but, fishing, had, a, major, role, in, the, economy, and, so, males, were, more, mobile, than, females, and, had, more, contact, with, other, parts, of, the, world, the, spread, of, the, pandemic, is, known, to, have, begun, in, the, spring, of, 1918, but, newfoundland, did, not, see, the, deadly, wave, until, june, or, july, which, aligns, with, the, high, demand, for, employment, in, the, fishery, the, majority, of, men, were, working, along, the, coast, during, the, summer, and, it, was, typical, for, entire, families, to, move, to, newfoundland, and, work, studies, show, a, much, higher, mortality, rate, in, males, compared, with, females, but, during, the, first, second, and, third, waves, of, the, pandemic, the, mortality, shifted, during, the, first, wave, men, had, a, higher, mortality, rate, but, the, mortality, rate, of, females, increased, and, was, higher, during, the, second, and, third, waves, the, female, population, was, larger, in, certain, regions, of, newfoundland, and, therefore, had, a, bigger, impact, on, the, death, rate, records, indicate, the, most, deaths, during, the, first, wave, of, the, pandemic, were, among, young, men, in, their, 20s, which, reflects, the, age, of, enlistment, in, the, war, the, mobility, of, young, men, during, 1918, was, linked, to, the, spread, of, influenza, and, the, biggest, wave, of, the, epidemic, in, late, 1917, and, throughout, 1918, thousands, of, male, troops, gathered, at, the, halifax, port, before, heading, to, europe, any, soldier, that, was, ill, and, could, not, depart, was, added, to, the, population, of, halifax, which, increased, the, case, rate, of, influenza, among, men, during, the, war, to, determine, the, cause, of, the, death, during, the, pandemic, war, scientists, used, the, commonwealth, war, graves, commission, cwgc, which, reported, under, 2, million, men, and, women, died, during, the, wars, with, a, record, of, those, who, died, from, 1917, to, 1918, the, movement, of, soldiers, during, this, time, and, the, transportation, from, united, states, between, canada, likely, had, a, significant, effect, on, the, spread, of, the, pandemic
