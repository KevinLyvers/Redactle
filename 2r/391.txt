the, great, bengal, famine, of, 1770, struck, bengal, and, bihar, between, 1769, and, 1770, and, affected, some, 30, million, people, it, occurred, during, a, period, of, dual, governance, in, bengal, this, existed, after, the, east, india, company, had, been, granted, the, diwani, or, the, right, to, collect, revenue, in, bengal, by, the, mughal, emperor, in, delhi, but, before, it, had, wrested, the, nizamat, or, control, of, civil, administration, which, continued, to, lie, with, the, mughal, governor, the, nawab, of, bengal, nazm, ud, daula, 1765, 72, crop, failure, in, autumn, 1768, and, summer, 1769, and, an, accompanying, smallpox, epidemic, were, thought, to, be, the, manifest, reasons, for, the, famine, the, east, india, company, had, farmed, out, tax, collection, on, account, of, a, shortage, of, trained, administrators, and, the, prevailing, uncertainty, may, have, worsened, the, famine, s, impact, other, factors, adding, to, the, pressure, were, grain, merchants, ceased, offering, grain, advances, to, peasants, but, the, market, mechanism, for, exporting, the, merchants, grain, to, other, regions, remained, in, place, the, east, india, company, purchased, a, large, portion, of, rice, for, its, army, and, the, company, s, private, servants, and, their, indian, gomasthas, created, local, monopolies, of, grain, by, the, end, of, 1769, rice, prices, had, risen, two, fold, and, in, 1770, they, rose, a, further, three, fold, in, bihar, the, continual, passage, of, armies, in, the, already, drought, stricken, countryside, worsened, the, conditions, the, east, india, company, provided, little, mitigation, through, direct, relief, efforts, nor, did, it, reduce, taxes, though, its, options, to, do, so, may, have, been, limited, by, the, summer, of, 1770, people, were, dying, everywhere, although, the, monsoon, immediately, after, did, bring, plentiful, rains, it, also, brought, diseases, to, which, many, among, the, enfeebled, fell, victim, for, several, years, thereafter, piracy, increased, on, the, hooghly, river, delta, deserted, and, overgrown, villages, were, a, common, sight, depopulation, however, was, uneven, affecting, north, bengal, and, bihar, severely, central, bengal, moderately, and, eastern, only, slightly, the, recovery, was, also, quicker, in, the, well, watered, bengal, delta, in, the, east, between, seven, and, ten, million, people, or, between, a, quarter, and, third, of, the, presidency, s, population, were, thought, to, have, died, the, loss, to, cultivation, was, estimated, to, be, a, third, of, the, total, cultivation, some, scholars, consider, these, numbers, to, be, exaggerated, in, large, part, because, reliable, demographic, information, had, been, lacking, in, 1770, even, so, the, famine, devastated, traditional, ways, of, life, in, the, affected, regions, it, proved, disastrous, to, the, mulberries, and, cotton, grown, in, bengal, as, a, result, a, large, proportion, of, the, dead, were, spinners, and, weavers, who, had, no, reserves, of, food, the, famine, hastened, the, end, of, dual, governance, in, bengal, the, company, becoming, the, sole, administrator, soon, after, its, cultural, impact, was, felt, long, afterwards, becoming, the, subject, a, century, later, of, bankim, chandra, chatterjee, s, influential, novel, anandamath, the, bengali, name, chi, tt, rer, m, nn, nt, r, is, derived, from, bengali, calendar, year, 1176, and, the, bengali, word, meaning, famine, the, regions, in, which, the, famine, occurred, affected, the, modern, indian, states, of, bihar, and, west, bengal, in, particular, but, the, famine, also, extended, into, orissa, and, jharkhand, as, well, as, modern, bangladesh, among, the, worst, affected, areas, were, central, and, northern, bengal, and, tirhut, champaran, and, bettiah, in, bihar, south, east, bengal, escaped, unscathed, it, had, an, excess, production, in, the, famine, years, the, famine, occurred, in, bengal, then, ruled, by, the, east, india, company, their, territory, included, modern, west, bengal, bangladesh, and, parts, of, assam, odisha, bihar, and, jharkhand, it, was, earlier, a, province, of, the, mughal, empire, from, the, 16th, century, and, was, ruled, by, a, nawab, or, governor, in, early, 18th, century, as, the, mughal, empire, started, collapsing, the, nawab, became, effectively, independent, of, the, mughal, rule, in, the, 17th, century, the, english, east, india, company, was, granted, the, town, of, calcutta, by, the, mughal, prince, shah, shuja, during, the, following, century, the, company, obtained, sole, trading, rights, for, the, province, and, became, the, dominant, power, in, bengal, in, 1757, at, the, battle, of, plassey, the, east, india, company, defeated, the, nawab, siraj, ud, daulah, annexing, large, portions, of, bengal, afterwards, in, 1764, their, military, control, was, reaffirmed, at, buxar, the, subsequent, treaty, gave, them, taxation, rights, known, as, dewan, the, east, india, company, thereby, became, the, de, facto, ruler, of, bengal, in, addition, to, profits, from, trade, the, company, had, been, granted, rights, of, taxation, in, 1764, and, within, a, few, years, had, raised, land, revenue, collections, by, about, 30, the, famine, came, in, the, backdrop, of, a, multitude, of, subsistence, crises, that, had, affected, bengal, since, the, early, eighteenth, century, a, failure, of, monsoon, in, bengal, and, bihar, had, led, to, partial, shortfall, of, produce, in, 1768, market, prices, were, higher, than, usual, in, early, 1769, with, usual, rains, in, 1769, the, situation, eased, for, a, while, and, grains, were, even, exported, to, madras, presidency, by, late, september, the, situation, was, again, bleak, with, drought, like, conditions, on, the, horizon, on, 18, september, 1769, naib, nazim, of, dhaka, mohammed, reza, khan, informed, harry, verelst, president, of, the, council, at, fort, william, about, the, dryness, of, the, season, the, same, month, john, cartier, esquire, and, second, in, command, of, the, council, chose, to, inform, the, court, of, directors, in, london, about, impending, famine, like, conditions, in, bengal, a, century, later, w, w, hunter, would, note, this, letter, to, be, the, only, serious, intimation, about, the, approaching, famine, and, find, the, absence, of, president, verelst, s, affirmation, to, be, striking, other, letters, sent, in, the, same, month, to, the, board, speculate, about, potential, loss, in, revenue, collection, but, do, not, discuss, the, famine, on, 23, october, becher, had, reported, to, the, council, about, great, dearth, and, scarcity, of, food, grains, at, murshidabad, this, prodded, the, council, to, purchase, 1, 2, million, maunds, of, rice, for, its, army, as, an, emergency, measure, charles, grant, betcher, s, agent, noted, that, the, first, sign, of, the, famine, was, already, visible, in, northern, districts, of, bengal, by, november, by, late, december, food, prices, had, spiked, sharply, and, the, western, districts, of, bengal, along, with, bihar, were, also, in, a, precarious, condition, on, 7, december, reza, khan, and, shitab, rai, proposed, to, the, council, that, they, enforce, a, humane, grain, collection, scheme, for, the, upcoming, fiscal, year, in, proportion, to, the, individual, produce, of, peasants, the, proposal, was, not, replied, to, w, w, hunter, would, later, accuse, that, these, people, often, had, their, incentives, to, dramatize, general, distress, on, 25, january, 1770, cartier, proposed, to, the, board, that, land, taxes, be, remitted, by, about, seven, percent, in, afflicted, areas, on, grounds, of, widespread, suffering, ten, days, later, cartier, reversed, his, stance, noting, that, the, revenues, kept, on, being, paid, despite, significant, distress, on, 28, february, the, council, proposed, that, husbandmen, who, failed, to, pay, the, taxes, be, treated, with, leniency, due, to, overbearing, conditions, of, a, poor, harvest, overall, no, relief, plan, was, yet, designed, by, february, despite, initial, hopes, of, a, reversal, in, fortunes, there, were, no, rains, and, the, spring, harvest, was, scanty, acting, upon, the, advice, of, reza, khan, the, council, chose, to, increase, taxes, by, 10, to, meet, revenue, targets, grain, prices, had, kept, rising, across, the, year, by, middle, of, may, the, distress, had, exploded, into, a, full, blown, famine, marked, with, mass, starvation, beggary, and, death, the, prices, of, food, would, skyrocket, as, the, province, ran, out, of, money, to, pay, for, the, scarce, produces, and, trade, effectively, ceased, khan, noted, that, lakhs, of, people, were, dying, daily, fires, were, widespread, and, the, tanks, had, not, a, drop, of, water, these, conditions, would, continue, for, about, three, months, the, company, provided, little, meaningful, mitigation, there, was, no, reduction, in, taxation, or, any, significant, relief, effort, in, october, 1769, the, company, requested, that, storehouses, be, constructed, in, patna, and, murshidabad, city, officials, were, instructed, to, prevent, monopoly, of, trade, and, have, farmers, raise, every, sort, of, dry, grain, that, was, possible, the, orders, were, largely, unsuccessful, many, company, officials, along, with, their, indian, assistants, gomasthas, would, exploit, the, famine, to, create, grain, monopolies, on, 13, february, khan, and, becher, proposed, that, six, rice, distribution, centers, be, opened, in, murshidabad, to, provide, half, a, seer, of, rice, a, day, per, head, the, proposal, was, approved, and, the, council, borne, about, 46, of, the, expenditure, the, remaining, sum, were, paid, by, nawab, najabat, ali, khan, himself, rai, durlabh, and, jagat, seth, one, distribution, center, was, opened, by, reza, khan, at, his, palace, of, nishat, bagh, the, murshidabad, model, was, later, emulated, in, calcutta, and, burdwan, to, feed, about, 3000, men, every, day, at, a, daily, expenditure, of, about, 75, rupees, since, early, april, rice, were, also, charitably, distributed, at, purnea, bhagalpur, birbhum, hugli, and, jesore, overall, about, 4000, pounds, of, rice, was, arranged, by, the, company, over, six, months, those, in, the, employment, of, company, and, nizamat, were, especially, favored, becher, obtained, a, total, of, 55, 449, maunds, of, rice, from, barisal, which, was, dispatched, for, company, troops, and, their, dependents, across, bengal, districts, which, exceeded, a, death, toll, of, twenty, thousand, per, month, were, granted, packages, of, 150, rupees, export, import, embargoes, were, set, up, to, check, prices, but, they, only, contributed, to, worsening, the, situation, the, province, had, no, money, to, pay, for, the, scarce, produces, and, trade, effectively, ceased, in, may, 1770, the, court, of, directors, estimated, that, about, one, third, of, the, population, approx, ten, million, had, perished, the, estimates, were, then, revised, by, becher, on, 2, june, to, about, three, in, every, eight, people, on, 12, july, becher, claimed, that, 500, people, were, dying, in, murshidabad, every, day, and, the, condition, was, far, worse, in, the, rural, hinterlands, cannibalism, was, apparently, on, exhibition, malaria, and, cholera, remained, additional, factors, a, smallpox, epidemic, that, coincided, with, the, start, of, the, pandemic, was, particularly, severe, and, included, nawab, najabat, ali, khan, of, murshidabad, among, the, victims, these, figures, have, been, uncritically, reproduced, by, most, modern, scholars, rajat, dutta, in, a, revisionist, history, of, the, economy, of, bengal, province, claimed, these, figures, to, be, inflated, and, carry, little, conviction, a, revised, toll, of, 1, 2, million, dead, 4, 5, of, the, population, was, put, forward, tim, dyson, supports, dutta, s, claims, of, inflation, and, notes, the, popular, figure, of, ten, million, indicative, of, at, least, a, 500, increase, in, annual, death, rate, to, be, barely, credible, however, dyson, refrains, from, making, any, specific, estimate, highlighted, are, the, facts, that, contemporary, bengal, lacked, any, significant, demographic, data, outside, calcutta, the, few, reliable, reports, on, effects, of, the, famine, were, based, on, unrepresentative, populations, and, many, cultivators, were, mobile, settlers, who, simply, migrated, to, better, off, territories, the, 1770, monsoons, brought, some, marginal, relief, and, a, perspective, on, the, rampant, depopulation, a, letter, by, the, council, regretted, the, wiping, out, of, numerous, industrious, peasants, and, manufacturers, the, following, year, as, the, drought, receded, most, of, the, land, lacked, tillers, the, economic, and, cultural, impact, of, the, famine, was, felt, long, afterwards, becoming, the, subject, a, century, later, of, bankim, chandra, chatterjee, s, influential, novel, anandamath
