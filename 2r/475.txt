the, american, frontier, also, known, as, the, old, west, and, popularly, known, as, the, wild, west, encompasses, the, geography, history, folklore, and, culture, associated, with, the, forward, wave, of, american, expansion, in, mainland, north, america, that, began, with, european, colonial, settlements, in, the, early, 17th, century, and, ended, with, the, admission, of, the, last, few, contiguous, western, territories, as, states, in, 1912, this, era, of, massive, migration, and, settlement, was, particularly, encouraged, by, president, thomas, jefferson, following, the, louisiana, purchase, giving, rise, to, the, expansionist, attitude, known, as, manifest, destiny, and, historians, frontier, thesis, the, legends, historical, events, and, folklore, of, the, american, frontier, known, as, the, frontier, myth, have, embedded, themselves, into, united, states, culture, so, much, so, that, the, old, west, and, the, western, genre, of, media, specifically, has, become, one, of, the, defining, features, of, american, national, identity, historians, have, debated, at, length, as, to, when, the, frontier, era, began, when, it, ended, and, which, were, its, key, sub, periods, for, example, the, old, west, subperiod, is, sometimes, used, by, historians, regarding, the, time, from, the, end, of, the, american, civil, war, in, 1865, to, when, the, superintendent, of, the, census, william, rush, merriam, stated, the, u, s, census, bureau, would, stop, recording, western, frontier, settlement, as, part, of, its, census, categories, after, the, 1890, u, s, census, his, successors, however, continued, the, practice, until, the, 1920, census, others, including, the, library, of, congress, and, university, of, oxford, often, cite, differing, points, reaching, into, the, early, 1900s, typically, within, the, first, two, decades, prior, to, american, entry, into, world, war, i, a, period, known, as, the, western, civil, war, of, incorporation, lasted, from, the, 1850s, to, 1919, this, period, included, historical, events, synonymous, with, the, archetypical, old, west, or, wild, west, such, as, violent, conflict, arising, from, encroaching, settlement, into, frontier, land, the, removal, and, assimilation, of, natives, consolidation, of, property, to, large, corporations, and, government, vigilantism, and, the, attempted, enforcement, of, laws, upon, outlaws, in, 1890, the, superintendent, of, the, census, william, rush, merriam, stated, up, to, and, including, 1880, the, country, had, a, frontier, of, settlement, but, at, present, the, unsettled, area, has, been, so, broken, into, by, isolated, bodies, of, settlement, that, there, can, hardly, be, said, to, be, a, frontier, line, in, the, discussion, of, its, extent, its, westward, movement, etc, it, can, not, therefore, any, longer, have, a, place, in, the, census, reports, despite, this, the, later, 1900, u, s, census, continued, to, show, the, westward, frontier, line, and, his, successors, continued, the, practice, by, the, 1910, u, s, census, however, the, frontier, had, shrunk, into, divided, areas, without, a, singular, westward, line, of, settlement, an, influx, of, agricultural, homesteaders, in, the, first, two, decades, of, the, 20th, century, taking, up, more, acreage, than, homestead, grants, in, the, entirety, of, the, 19th, century, is, cited, to, have, significantly, reduced, open, land, a, frontier, is, a, zone, of, contact, at, the, edge, of, a, line, of, settlement, theorist, frederick, jackson, turner, went, deeper, arguing, that, the, frontier, was, the, scene, of, a, defining, process, of, american, civilization, the, frontier, he, asserted, promoted, the, formation, of, a, composite, nationality, for, the, american, people, he, theorized, it, was, a, process, of, development, this, perennial, rebirth, this, fluidity, of, american, life, this, expansion, westward, furnish, the, forces, dominating, american, character, turner, s, ideas, since, 1893, have, inspired, generations, of, historians, and, critics, to, explore, multiple, individual, american, frontiers, but, the, popular, folk, frontier, concentrates, on, the, conquest, and, settlement, of, native, american, lands, west, of, the, mississippi, river, in, what, is, now, the, midwest, texas, the, great, plains, the, rocky, mountains, the, southwest, and, the, west, coast, enormous, popular, attention, was, focused, on, the, western, united, states, especially, the, southwest, in, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, and, the, early, 20th, century, from, the, 1850s, to, the, 1910s, such, media, typically, exaggerated, the, romance, anarchy, and, chaotic, violence, of, the, period, for, greater, dramatic, effect, this, inspired, the, western, genre, of, film, along, with, television, shows, novels, comic, books, video, games, children, s, toys, and, costumes, as, defined, by, hine, and, faragher, frontier, history, tells, the, story, of, the, creation, and, defense, of, communities, the, use, of, the, land, the, development, of, crops, and, hotels, and, the, formation, of, states, they, explain, it, is, a, tale, of, conquest, but, also, one, of, survival, persistence, and, the, merging, of, peoples, and, cultures, that, gave, birth, and, continuing, life, to, america, turner, himself, repeatedly, emphasized, how, the, availability, of, free, land, to, start, new, farms, attracted, pioneering, americans, the, existence, of, an, area, of, free, land, its, continuous, recession, and, the, advance, of, american, settlement, westward, explain, american, development, through, treaties, with, foreign, nations, and, native, tribes, political, compromise, military, conquest, the, establishment, of, law, and, order, the, building, of, farms, ranches, and, towns, the, marking, of, trails, and, digging, of, mines, and, the, pulling, in, of, great, migrations, of, foreigners, the, united, states, expanded, from, coast, to, coast, fulfilling, the, ideology, of, manifest, destiny, in, his, frontier, thesis, 1893, turner, theorized, that, the, frontier, was, a, process, that, transformed, europeans, into, a, new, people, the, americans, whose, values, focused, on, equality, democracy, and, optimism, as, well, as, individualism, self, reliance, and, even, violence, the, frontier, is, the, margin, of, undeveloped, territory, that, would, comprise, the, united, states, beyond, the, established, frontier, line, the, u, s, census, bureau, designated, frontier, territory, as, generally, unoccupied, land, with, a, population, density, of, fewer, than, 2, people, per, square, mile, 0, 77, people, per, square, kilometer, the, frontier, line, was, the, outer, boundary, of, european, american, settlement, into, this, land, beginning, with, the, first, permanent, european, settlements, on, the, east, coast, it, has, moved, steadily, westward, from, the, 1600s, to, the, 1900s, decades, with, occasional, movements, north, into, maine, and, new, hampshire, south, into, florida, and, east, from, california, into, nevada, pockets, of, settlements, would, also, appear, far, past, the, established, frontier, line, particularly, on, the, west, coast, and, the, deep, interior, with, settlements, such, as, los, angeles, and, salt, lake, city, respectively, the, west, was, the, recently, settled, area, near, that, boundary, thus, parts, of, the, midwest, and, american, south, though, no, longer, considered, western, have, a, frontier, heritage, along, with, the, modern, western, states, richard, w, slatta, in, his, view, of, the, frontier, writes, that, historians, sometimes, define, the, american, west, as, lands, west, of, the, 98th, meridian, or, 98, west, longitude, and, that, other, definitions, of, the, region, include, all, lands, west, of, the, mississippi, or, missouri, rivers, key, states, territories, disputed, areas, other, countries, in, the, colonial, era, before, 1776, the, west, was, of, high, priority, for, settlers, and, politicians, the, american, frontier, began, when, jamestown, virginia, was, settled, by, the, english, in, 1607, in, the, earliest, days, of, european, settlement, on, the, atlantic, coast, until, about, 1680, the, frontier, was, essentially, any, part, of, the, interior, of, the, continent, beyond, the, fringe, of, existing, settlements, along, the, atlantic, coast, english, french, spanish, and, dutch, patterns, of, expansion, and, settlement, were, quite, different, only, a, few, thousand, french, migrated, to, canada, these, habitants, settled, in, villages, along, the, st, lawrence, river, building, communities, that, remained, stable, for, long, stretches, although, french, fur, traders, ranged, widely, through, the, great, lakes, and, midwest, region, they, seldom, settled, down, french, settlement, was, limited, to, a, few, very, small, villages, such, as, kaskaskia, illinois, as, well, as, a, larger, settlement, around, new, orleans, in, what, is, now, new, york, state, the, dutch, set, up, fur, trading, posts, in, the, hudson, river, valley, followed, by, large, grants, of, land, to, rich, landowning, patroons, who, brought, in, tenant, farmers, who, created, compact, permanent, villages, they, created, a, dense, rural, settlement, in, upstate, new, york, but, they, did, not, push, westward, areas, in, the, north, that, were, in, the, frontier, stage, by, 1700, generally, had, poor, transportation, facilities, so, the, opportunity, for, commercial, agriculture, was, low, these, areas, remained, primarily, in, subsistence, agriculture, and, as, a, result, by, the, 1760s, these, societies, were, highly, egalitarian, as, explained, by, historian, jackson, turner, main, the, typical, frontier, society, therefore, was, one, in, which, class, distinctions, were, minimized, the, wealthy, speculator, if, one, was, involved, usually, remained, at, home, so, that, ordinarily, no, one, of, wealth, was, a, resident, the, class, of, landless, poor, was, small, the, great, majority, were, landowners, most, of, whom, were, also, poor, because, they, were, starting, with, little, property, and, had, not, yet, cleared, much, land, nor, had, they, acquired, the, farm, tools, and, animals, which, would, one, day, make, them, prosperous, few, artisans, settled, on, the, frontier, except, for, those, who, practiced, a, trade, to, supplement, their, primary, occupation, of, farming, there, might, be, a, storekeeper, a, minister, and, perhaps, a, doctor, and, there, were, several, landless, laborers, all, the, rest, were, farmers, in, the, south, frontier, areas, that, lacked, transportation, such, as, the, appalachian, mountains, region, remained, based, on, subsistence, farming, and, resembled, the, egalitarianism, of, their, northern, counterparts, although, they, had, a, larger, upper, class, of, slaveowners, north, carolina, was, representative, however, frontier, areas, of, 1700, that, had, good, river, connections, were, increasingly, transformed, into, plantation, agriculture, rich, men, came, in, bought, up, the, good, land, and, worked, it, with, slaves, the, area, was, no, longer, frontier, it, had, a, stratified, society, comprising, a, powerful, upper, class, white, landowning, gentry, a, small, middle, class, a, fairly, large, group, of, landless, or, tenant, white, farmers, and, a, growing, slave, population, at, the, bottom, of, the, social, pyramid, unlike, the, north, where, small, towns, and, even, cities, were, common, the, south, was, overwhelmingly, rural, the, seaboard, colonial, settlements, gave, priority, to, land, ownership, for, individual, farmers, and, as, the, population, grew, they, pushed, westward, for, fresh, farmland, unlike, britain, where, a, small, number, of, landlords, owned, most, of, the, land, ownership, in, america, was, cheap, easy, and, widespread, land, ownership, brought, a, degree, of, independence, as, well, as, a, vote, for, local, and, provincial, offices, the, typical, new, england, settlements, were, quite, compact, and, small, under, a, square, mile, conflict, with, the, native, americans, arose, out, of, political, issues, namely, who, would, rule, early, frontier, areas, east, of, the, appalachian, mountains, included, the, connecticut, river, valley, and, northern, new, england, which, was, a, move, to, the, north, not, the, west, settlers, on, the, frontier, often, connected, isolated, incidents, to, indicate, indian, conspiracies, to, attack, them, but, these, lacked, a, french, diplomatic, dimension, after, 1763, or, a, spanish, connection, after, 1820, most, of, the, frontiers, experienced, numerous, conflicts, the, french, and, indian, war, broke, out, between, britain, and, france, with, the, french, making, up, for, their, small, colonial, population, base, by, enlisting, native, war, parties, as, allies, the, series, of, large, wars, spilling, over, from, european, wars, ended, in, a, complete, victory, for, the, british, in, the, worldwide, seven, years, war, in, the, peace, treaty, of, 1763, france, ceded, practically, everything, as, the, lands, west, of, the, mississippi, river, in, addition, to, florida, and, new, orleans, went, to, spain, otherwise, lands, east, of, the, mississippi, river, and, what, is, now, canada, went, to, britain, regardless, of, wars, americans, were, moving, across, the, appalachians, into, western, pennsylvania, what, is, now, west, virginia, and, areas, of, the, ohio, country, kentucky, and, tennessee, in, the, southern, settlements, via, the, cumberland, gap, their, most, famous, leader, was, daniel, boone, young, george, washington, promoted, settlements, in, west, virginia, on, lands, awarded, to, him, and, his, soldiers, by, the, royal, government, in, payment, for, their, wartime, service, in, virginia, s, militia, settlements, west, of, the, appalachian, mountains, were, curtailed, briefly, by, the, royal, proclamation, of, 1763, forbidding, settlement, in, this, area, the, treaty, of, fort, stanwix, 1768, re, opened, most, of, the, western, lands, for, frontiersmen, to, settle, the, nation, was, at, peace, after, 1783, the, states, gave, congress, control, of, the, western, lands, and, an, effective, system, for, population, expansion, was, developed, the, northwest, ordinance, of, 1787, abolished, slavery, in, the, area, north, of, the, ohio, river, and, promised, statehood, when, a, territory, reached, a, threshold, population, as, ohio, did, in, 1803, the, first, major, movement, west, of, the, appalachian, mountains, originated, in, pennsylvania, virginia, and, north, carolina, as, soon, as, the, revolutionary, war, ended, in, 1781, pioneers, housed, themselves, in, a, rough, lean, to, or, at, most, a, one, room, log, cabin, the, main, food, supply, at, first, came, from, hunting, deer, turkeys, and, other, abundant, game, clad, in, typical, frontier, garb, leather, breeches, moccasins, fur, cap, and, hunting, shirt, and, girded, by, a, belt, from, which, hung, a, hunting, knife, and, a, shot, pouch, all, homemade, the, pioneer, presented, a, unique, appearance, in, a, short, time, he, opened, in, the, woods, a, patch, or, clearing, on, which, he, grew, corn, wheat, flax, tobacco, and, other, products, even, fruit, in, a, few, years, the, pioneer, added, hogs, sheep, and, cattle, and, perhaps, acquired, a, horse, homespun, clothing, replaced, the, animal, skins, the, more, restless, pioneers, grew, dissatisfied, with, over, civilized, life, and, uprooted, themselves, again, to, move, 50, or, a, hundred, miles, 80, or, 160, km, further, west, the, land, policy, of, the, new, nation, was, conservative, paying, special, attention, to, the, needs, of, the, settled, east, the, goals, sought, by, both, parties, in, the, 1790, 1820, era, were, to, grow, the, economy, avoid, draining, away, the, skilled, workers, needed, in, the, east, distribute, the, land, wisely, sell, it, at, prices, that, were, reasonable, to, settlers, yet, high, enough, to, pay, off, the, national, debt, clear, legal, titles, and, create, a, diversified, western, economy, that, would, be, closely, interconnected, with, the, settled, areas, with, minimal, risk, of, a, breakaway, movement, by, the, 1830s, however, the, west, was, filling, up, with, squatters, who, had, no, legal, deed, although, they, may, have, paid, money, to, previous, settlers, the, jacksonian, democrats, favored, the, squatters, by, promising, rapid, access, to, cheap, land, by, contrast, henry, clay, was, alarmed, at, the, lawless, rabble, heading, west, who, were, undermining, the, utopian, concept, of, a, law, abiding, stable, middle, class, republican, community, rich, southerners, meanwhile, looked, for, opportunities, to, buy, high, quality, land, to, set, up, slave, plantations, the, free, soil, movement, of, the, 1840s, called, for, low, cost, land, for, free, white, farmers, a, position, enacted, into, law, by, the, new, republican, party, in, 1862, offering, free, 160, acres, 65, ha, homesteads, to, all, adults, male, and, female, black, and, white, native, born, or, immigrant, after, winning, the, revolutionary, war, 1783, american, settlers, in, large, numbers, poured, into, the, west, in, 1788, american, pioneers, to, the, northwest, territory, established, marietta, ohio, as, the, first, permanent, american, settlement, in, the, northwest, territory, in, 1775, daniel, boone, blazed, a, trail, for, the, transylvania, company, from, virginia, through, the, cumberland, gap, into, central, kentucky, it, was, later, lengthened, to, reach, the, falls, of, the, ohio, at, louisville, the, wilderness, road, was, steep, and, rough, and, it, could, only, be, traversed, on, foot, or, horseback, but, it, was, the, best, route, for, thousands, of, settlers, moving, into, kentucky, in, some, areas, they, had, to, face, native, attacks, in, 1784, alone, natives, killed, over, 100, travelers, on, the, wilderness, road, kentucky, at, this, time, had, been, depopulated, it, was, empty, of, indian, villages, however, raiding, parties, sometimes, came, through, one, of, those, intercepted, was, abraham, lincoln, s, grandfather, who, was, scalped, in, 1784, near, louisville, the, war, of, 1812, marked, the, final, confrontation, involving, major, british, and, native, forces, fighting, to, stop, american, expansion, the, british, war, goal, included, the, creation, of, an, indian, barrier, state, under, british, auspices, in, the, midwest, which, would, halt, american, expansion, westward, american, frontier, militiamen, under, general, andrew, jackson, defeated, the, creeks, and, opened, the, southwest, while, militia, under, governor, william, henry, harrison, defeated, the, native, british, alliance, at, the, battle, of, the, thames, in, canada, in, 1813, the, death, in, battle, of, the, native, leader, tecumseh, dissolved, the, coalition, of, hostile, native, tribes, meanwhile, general, andrew, jackson, ended, the, native, military, threat, in, the, southeast, at, the, battle, of, horseshoe, bend, in, 1814, in, alabama, in, general, the, frontiersmen, battled, the, natives, with, little, help, from, the, u, s, army, or, the, federal, government, to, end, the, war, american, diplomats, negotiated, the, treaty, of, ghent, signed, towards, the, end, of, 1814, with, britain, they, rejected, the, british, plan, to, set, up, a, native, state, in, u, s, territory, south, of, the, great, lakes, they, explained, the, american, policy, toward, the, acquisition, of, native, lands, the, united, states, while, intending, never, to, acquire, lands, from, the, indians, otherwise, than, peaceably, and, with, their, free, consent, are, fully, determined, in, that, manner, progressively, and, in, proportion, as, their, growing, population, may, require, to, reclaim, from, the, state, of, nature, and, to, bring, into, cultivation, every, portion, of, the, territory, contained, within, their, acknowledged, boundaries, in, thus, providing, for, the, support, of, millions, of, civilized, beings, they, will, not, violate, any, dictate, of, justice, or, humanity, for, they, will, not, only, give, to, the, few, thousand, savages, scattered, over, that, territory, an, ample, equivalent, for, any, right, they, may, surrender, but, will, always, leave, them, the, possession, of, lands, more, than, they, can, cultivate, and, more, than, adequate, to, their, subsistence, comfort, and, enjoyment, by, cultivation, if, this, is, a, spirit, of, aggrandizement, the, undersigned, are, prepared, to, admit, in, that, sense, its, existence, but, they, must, deny, that, it, affords, the, slightest, proof, of, an, intention, not, to, respect, the, boundaries, between, them, and, european, nations, or, of, a, desire, to, encroach, upon, the, territories, of, great, britain, they, will, not, suppose, that, that, government, will, avow, as, the, basis, of, their, policy, towards, the, united, states, a, system, of, arresting, their, natural, growth, within, their, territories, for, the, sake, of, preserving, a, perpetual, desert, for, savages, as, settlers, poured, in, the, frontier, districts, first, became, territories, with, an, elected, legislature, and, a, governor, appointed, by, the, president, then, when, the, population, reached, 100, 000, the, territory, applied, for, statehood, frontiersmen, typically, dropped, the, legalistic, formalities, and, restrictive, franchise, favored, by, eastern, upper, classes, and, adopting, more, democracy, and, more, egalitarianism, in, 1810, the, western, frontier, had, reached, the, mississippi, river, st, louis, missouri, was, the, largest, town, on, the, frontier, the, gateway, for, travel, westward, and, a, principal, trading, center, for, mississippi, river, traffic, and, inland, commerce, but, remained, under, spanish, control, until, 1803, thomas, jefferson, thought, of, himself, as, a, man, of, the, frontier, and, was, keenly, interested, in, expanding, and, exploring, the, west, jefferson, s, louisiana, purchase, of, 1803, doubled, the, size, of, the, nation, at, the, cost, of, 15, million, or, about, 0, 04, per, acre, 305, million, in, 2023, dollars, less, than, 42, cents, per, acre, federalists, opposed, the, expansion, but, jeffersonians, hailed, the, opportunity, to, create, millions, of, new, farms, to, expand, the, domain, of, land, owning, yeomen, the, ownership, would, strengthen, the, ideal, republican, society, based, on, agriculture, not, commerce, governed, lightly, and, promoting, self, reliance, and, virtue, as, well, as, form, the, political, base, for, jeffersonian, democracy, france, was, paid, for, its, sovereignty, over, the, territory, in, terms, of, international, law, between, 1803, and, the, 1870s, the, federal, government, purchased, the, land, from, the, native, tribes, then, in, possession, of, it, 20th, century, accountants, and, courts, have, calculated, the, value, of, the, payments, made, to, the, natives, which, included, future, payments, of, cash, food, horses, cattle, supplies, buildings, schooling, and, medical, care, in, cash, terms, the, total, paid, to, the, tribes, in, the, area, of, the, louisiana, purchase, amounted, to, about, 2, 6, billion, or, nearly, 9, billion, in, 2016, dollars, additional, sums, were, paid, to, the, natives, living, east, of, the, mississippi, for, their, lands, as, well, as, payments, to, natives, living, in, parts, of, the, west, outside, the, louisiana, purchase, even, before, the, purchase, jefferson, was, planning, expeditions, to, explore, and, map, the, lands, he, charged, lewis, and, clark, to, explore, the, missouri, river, and, such, principal, stream, of, it, as, by, its, course, and, communication, with, the, waters, of, the, pacific, ocean, whether, the, columbia, oregon, colorado, or, any, other, river, may, offer, the, most, direct, and, practicable, communication, across, the, continent, for, commerce, jefferson, also, instructed, the, expedition, to, study, the, region, s, native, tribes, including, their, morals, language, and, culture, weather, soil, rivers, commercial, trading, and, animal, and, plant, life, entrepreneurs, most, notably, john, jacob, astor, quickly, seized, the, opportunity, and, expanded, fur, trading, operations, into, the, pacific, northwest, astor, s, fort, astoria, later, fort, george, at, the, mouth, of, the, columbia, river, became, the, first, permanent, white, settlement, in, that, area, although, it, was, not, profitable, for, astor, he, set, up, the, american, fur, company, in, an, attempt, to, break, the, hold, that, the, hudson, s, bay, company, monopoly, had, over, the, region, by, 1820, astor, had, taken, over, independent, traders, to, create, a, profitable, monopoly, he, left, the, business, as, a, multi, millionaire, in, 1834, as, the, frontier, moved, west, trappers, and, hunters, moved, ahead, of, settlers, searching, out, new, supplies, of, beaver, and, other, skins, for, shipment, to, europe, the, hunters, were, the, first, europeans, in, much, of, the, old, west, and, they, formed, the, first, working, relationships, with, the, native, americans, in, the, west, they, added, extensive, knowledge, of, the, northwest, terrain, including, the, important, south, pass, through, the, central, rocky, mountains, discovered, about, 1812, it, later, became, a, major, route, for, settlers, to, oregon, and, washington, by, 1820, however, a, new, brigade, rendezvous, system, sent, company, men, in, brigades, cross, country, on, long, expeditions, bypassing, many, tribes, it, also, encouraged, free, trappers, to, explore, new, regions, on, their, own, at, the, end, of, the, gathering, season, the, trappers, would, rendezvous, and, turn, in, their, goods, for, pay, at, river, ports, along, the, green, river, upper, missouri, and, the, upper, mississippi, st, louis, was, the, largest, of, the, rendezvous, towns, by, 1830, however, fashions, changed, and, beaver, hats, were, replaced, by, silk, hats, ending, the, demand, for, expensive, american, furs, thus, ended, the, era, of, the, mountain, men, trappers, and, scouts, such, as, jedediah, smith, hugh, glass, davy, crockett, jack, omohundro, and, others, the, trade, in, beaver, fur, virtually, ceased, by, 1845, there, was, wide, agreement, on, the, need, to, settle, the, new, territories, quickly, but, the, debate, polarized, over, the, price, the, government, should, charge, the, conservatives, and, whigs, typified, by, the, president, john, quincy, adams, wanted, a, moderated, pace, that, charged, the, newcomers, enough, to, pay, the, costs, of, the, federal, government, the, democrats, however, tolerated, a, wild, scramble, for, land, at, very, low, prices, the, final, resolution, came, in, the, homestead, law, of, 1862, with, a, moderated, pace, that, gave, settlers, 160, acres, free, after, they, worked, on, it, for, five, years, the, private, profit, motive, dominated, the, movement, westward, but, the, federal, government, played, a, supporting, role, in, securing, the, land, through, treaties, and, setting, up, territorial, governments, with, governors, appointed, by, the, president, the, federal, government, first, acquired, western, territory, through, treaties, with, other, nations, or, native, tribes, then, it, sent, surveyors, to, map, and, document, the, land, by, the, 20th, century, washington, bureaucracies, managed, the, federal, lands, such, as, the, united, states, general, land, office, in, the, interior, department, and, after, 1891, the, forest, service, in, the, department, of, agriculture, after, 1900, dam, building, and, flood, control, became, major, concerns, transportation, was, a, key, issue, and, the, army, especially, the, army, corps, of, engineers, was, given, full, responsibility, for, facilitating, navigation, on, the, rivers, the, steamboat, first, used, on, the, ohio, river, in, 1811, made, possible, inexpensive, travel, using, the, river, systems, especially, the, mississippi, and, missouri, rivers, and, their, tributaries, army, expeditions, up, the, missouri, river, in, 1818, 1825, allowed, engineers, to, improve, the, technology, for, example, the, army, s, steamboat, western, engineer, of, 1819, combined, a, very, shallow, draft, with, one, of, the, earliest, stern, wheels, in, 1819, 1825, colonel, henry, atkinson, developed, keelboats, with, hand, powered, paddle, wheels, the, federal, postal, system, played, a, crucial, role, in, national, expansion, it, facilitated, expansion, into, the, west, by, creating, an, inexpensive, fast, convenient, communication, system, letters, from, early, settlers, provided, information, and, boosterism, to, encourage, increased, migration, to, the, west, helped, scattered, families, stay, in, touch, and, provide, neutral, help, assisted, entrepreneurs, to, find, business, opportunities, and, made, possible, regular, commercial, relationships, between, merchants, and, the, west, and, wholesalers, and, factories, back, east, the, postal, service, likewise, assisted, the, army, in, expanding, control, over, the, vast, western, territories, the, widespread, circulation, of, important, newspapers, by, mail, such, as, the, new, york, weekly, tribune, facilitated, coordination, among, politicians, in, different, states, the, postal, service, helped, to, integrate, already, established, areas, with, the, frontier, creating, a, spirit, of, nationalism, and, providing, a, necessary, infrastructure, the, army, early, on, assumed, the, mission, of, protecting, settlers, along, with, the, westward, expansion, trails, a, policy, that, was, described, by, u, s, secretary, of, war, john, b, floyd, in, 1857, a, line, of, posts, running, parallel, without, frontier, but, near, to, the, indians, usual, habitations, placed, at, convenient, distances, and, suitable, positions, and, occupied, by, infantry, would, exercise, a, salutary, restraint, upon, the, tribes, who, would, feel, that, any, foray, by, their, warriors, upon, the, white, settlements, would, meet, with, prompt, retaliation, upon, their, own, homes, there, was, a, debate, at, the, time, about, the, best, size, for, the, forts, with, jefferson, davis, winfield, scott, and, thomas, jesup, supporting, forts, that, were, larger, but, fewer, in, number, than, floyd, floyd, s, plan, was, more, expensive, but, had, the, support, of, settlers, and, the, general, public, who, preferred, that, the, military, remain, as, close, as, possible, the, frontier, area, was, vast, and, even, davis, conceded, that, concentration, would, have, exposed, portions, of, the, frontier, to, native, hostilities, without, any, protection, government, and, private, enterprise, sent, many, explorers, to, the, west, in, 1805, 1806, army, lieutenant, zebulon, pike, 1779, 1813, led, a, party, of, 20, soldiers, to, find, the, headwaters, of, the, mississippi, he, later, explored, the, red, and, arkansas, rivers, in, spanish, territory, eventually, reaching, the, rio, grande, on, his, return, pike, sighted, the, peak, in, colorado, named, after, him, major, stephen, harriman, long, 1784, 1864, led, the, yellowstone, and, missouri, expeditions, of, 1819, 1820, but, his, categorizing, in, 1823, of, the, great, plains, as, arid, and, useless, led, to, the, region, getting, a, bad, reputation, as, the, great, american, desert, which, discouraged, settlement, in, that, area, for, several, decades, in, 1811, naturalists, thomas, nuttall, 1786, 1859, and, john, bradbury, 1768, 1823, traveled, up, the, missouri, river, documenting, and, drawing, plant, and, animal, life, artist, george, catlin, 1796, 1872, painted, accurate, paintings, of, native, american, culture, swiss, artist, karl, bodmer, made, compelling, landscapes, and, portraits, john, james, audubon, 1785, 1851, is, famous, for, classifying, and, painting, in, minute, details, 500, species, of, birds, published, in, birds, of, america, the, most, famous, of, the, explorers, was, john, charles, fr, mont, 1813, 1890, an, army, officer, in, the, corps, of, topographical, engineers, he, displayed, a, talent, for, exploration, and, a, genius, at, self, promotion, that, gave, him, the, sobriquet, of, pathmarker, of, the, west, and, led, him, to, the, presidential, nomination, of, the, new, republican, party, in, 1856, he, led, a, series, of, expeditions, in, the, 1840s, which, answered, many, of, the, outstanding, geographic, questions, about, the, little, known, region, he, crossed, through, the, rocky, mountains, by, five, different, routes, and, mapped, parts, of, oregon, and, california, in, 1846, 1847, he, played, a, role, in, conquering, california, in, 1848, 1849, fr, mont, was, assigned, to, locate, a, central, route, through, the, mountains, for, the, proposed, transcontinental, railroad, but, his, expedition, ended, in, near, disaster, when, it, became, lost, and, was, trapped, by, heavy, snow, his, reports, mixed, narrative, of, exciting, adventure, with, scientific, data, and, detailed, practical, information, for, travelers, it, caught, the, public, imagination, and, inspired, many, to, head, west, goetzman, says, it, was, monumental, in, its, breadth, a, classic, of, exploring, literature, while, colleges, were, springing, up, across, the, northeast, there, was, little, competition, on, the, western, frontier, for, transylvania, university, founded, in, lexington, kentucky, in, 1780, it, boasted, of, a, law, school, in, addition, to, its, undergraduate, and, medical, programs, transylvania, attracted, politically, ambitious, young, men, from, across, the, southwest, including, 50, who, became, united, states, senators, 101, representatives, 36, governors, and, 34, ambassadors, as, well, as, jefferson, davis, the, president, of, the, confederacy, most, frontiersmen, showed, little, commitment, to, religion, until, traveling, evangelists, began, to, appear, and, to, produce, revivals, the, local, pioneers, responded, enthusiastically, to, these, events, and, in, effect, evolved, their, populist, religions, especially, during, the, second, great, awakening, 1790, 1840, which, featured, outdoor, camp, meetings, lasting, a, week, or, more, and, which, introduced, many, people, to, organized, religion, for, the, first, time, one, of, the, largest, and, most, famous, camp, meetings, took, place, at, cane, ridge, kentucky, in, 1801, the, local, baptists, set, up, small, independent, churches, baptists, abjured, centralized, authority, each, local, church, was, founded, on, the, principle, of, independence, of, the, local, congregation, on, the, other, hand, bishops, of, the, well, organized, centralized, methodists, assigned, circuit, riders, to, specific, areas, for, several, years, at, a, time, then, moved, them, to, fresh, territory, several, new, denominations, were, formed, of, which, the, largest, was, the, disciples, of, christ, the, established, eastern, churches, were, slow, to, meet, the, needs, of, the, frontier, the, presbyterians, and, congregationalists, since, they, depended, on, well, educated, ministers, were, shorthanded, in, evangelizing, the, frontier, they, set, up, a, plan, of, union, of, 1801, to, combine, resources, on, the, frontier, historian, mark, wyman, calls, wisconsin, a, palimpsest, of, layer, upon, layer, of, peoples, and, forces, each, imprinting, permanent, influences, he, identified, these, layers, as, multiple, frontiers, over, three, centuries, native, american, frontier, french, frontier, english, frontier, fur, trade, frontier, mining, frontier, and, the, logging, frontier, finally, the, coming, of, the, railroad, brought, the, end, of, the, frontier, frederick, jackson, turner, grew, up, in, wisconsin, during, its, last, frontier, stage, and, in, his, travels, around, the, state, he, could, see, the, layers, of, social, and, political, development, one, of, turner, s, last, students, merle, curti, used, an, in, depth, analysis, of, local, wisconsin, history, to, test, turner, s, thesis, about, democracy, turner, s, view, was, that, american, democracy, involved, widespread, participation, in, the, making, of, decisions, affecting, the, common, life, the, development, of, initiative, and, self, reliance, and, equality, of, economic, and, cultural, opportunity, it, thus, also, involved, americanization, of, immigrant, curti, found, that, from, 1840, to, 1860, in, wisconsin, the, poorest, groups, gained, rapidly, in, land, ownership, and, often, rose, to, political, leadership, at, the, local, level, he, found, that, even, landless, young, farmworkers, were, soon, able, to, obtain, their, farms, free, land, on, the, frontier, therefore, created, opportunity, and, democracy, for, both, european, immigrants, as, well, as, old, stock, yankees, from, the, 1770s, to, the, 1830s, pioneers, moved, into, the, new, lands, that, stretched, from, kentucky, to, alabama, to, texas, most, were, farmers, who, moved, in, family, groups, historian, louis, hacker, shows, how, wasteful, the, first, generation, of, pioneers, was, they, were, too, ignorant, to, cultivate, the, land, properly, and, when, the, natural, fertility, of, virgin, land, was, used, up, they, sold, out, and, moved, west, to, try, again, hacker, describes, that, in, kentucky, about, 1812, farms, were, for, sale, with, from, ten, to, fifty, acres, cleared, possessing, log, houses, peach, and, sometimes, apple, orchards, enclosed, in, fences, and, having, plenty, of, standing, timber, for, fuel, the, land, was, sown, in, wheat, and, corn, which, were, the, staples, while, hemp, was, being, cultivated, in, increasing, quantities, in, the, fertile, river, bottoms, yet, on, the, whole, it, was, an, agricultural, society, without, skill, or, resources, it, committed, all, those, sins, which, characterize, wasteful, and, ignorant, husbandry, grass, seed, was, not, sown, for, hay, and, as, a, result, the, farm, animals, had, to, forage, for, themselves, in, the, forests, the, fields, were, not, permitted, to, lie, in, pasturage, a, single, crop, was, planted, in, the, soil, until, the, land, was, exhausted, the, manure, was, not, returned, to, the, fields, only, a, small, part, of, the, farm, was, brought, under, cultivation, the, rest, being, permitted, to, stand, in, timber, instruments, of, cultivation, were, rude, and, clumsy, and, only, too, few, many, of, them, being, made, on, the, farm, it, is, plain, why, the, american, frontier, settler, was, on, the, move, continually, it, was, not, his, fear, of, too, close, contact, with, the, comforts, and, restraints, of, a, civilized, society, that, stirred, him, into, a, ceaseless, activity, nor, merely, the, chance, of, selling, out, at, a, profit, to, the, coming, wave, of, settlers, it, was, his, wasting, land, that, drove, him, on, hunger, was, the, goad, the, pioneer, farmer, s, ignorance, his, inadequate, facilities, for, cultivation, his, limited, means, of, transport, necessitated, his, frequent, changes, of, scene, he, could, succeed, only, with, virgin, soil, hacker, adds, that, the, second, wave, of, settlers, reclaimed, the, land, repaired, the, damage, and, practiced, more, sustainable, agriculture, historian, frederick, jackson, turner, explored, the, individualistic, worldview, and, values, of, the, first, generation, what, they, objected, to, was, arbitrary, obstacles, artificial, limitations, upon, the, freedom, of, each, member, of, this, frontier, folk, to, work, out, his, career, without, fear, or, favor, what, they, instinctively, opposed, was, the, crystallization, of, differences, the, monopolization, of, opportunity, and, the, fixing, of, that, monopoly, by, government, or, by, social, customs, the, road, must, be, open, the, game, must, be, played, according, to, the, rules, there, must, be, no, artificial, stifling, of, equality, of, opportunity, no, closed, doors, to, the, able, no, stopping, the, free, game, before, it, was, played, to, the, end, more, than, that, there, was, an, unformulated, perhaps, but, very, real, feeling, that, mere, success, in, the, game, by, which, the, abler, men, were, able, to, achieve, pre, minence, gave, to, the, successful, ones, no, right, to, look, down, upon, their, neighbors, no, vested, title, to, assert, superiority, as, a, matter, of, pride, and, to, the, diminution, of, the, equal, right, and, dignity, of, the, less, successful, manifest, destiny, was, the, controversial, belief, that, the, united, states, was, preordained, to, expand, from, the, atlantic, coast, to, the, pacific, coast, and, efforts, made, to, realize, that, belief, the, concept, has, appeared, during, colonial, times, but, the, term, was, coined, in, the, 1840s, by, a, popular, magazine, which, editorialized, the, fulfillment, of, our, manifest, destiny, to, overspread, the, continent, allotted, by, providence, for, the, free, development, of, our, yearly, multiplying, millions, as, the, nation, grew, manifest, destiny, became, a, rallying, cry, for, expansionists, in, the, democratic, party, in, the, 1840s, the, tyler, and, polk, administrations, 1841, 1849, successfully, promoted, this, nationalistic, doctrine, however, the, whig, party, which, represented, business, and, financial, interests, stood, opposed, to, manifest, destiny, whig, leaders, such, as, henry, clay, and, abraham, lincoln, called, for, deepening, the, society, through, modernization, and, urbanization, instead, of, simple, horizontal, expansion, starting, with, the, annexation, of, texas, the, expansionists, got, the, upper, hand, john, quincy, adams, an, anti, slavery, whig, felt, the, texas, annexation, in, 1845, to, be, the, heaviest, calamity, that, ever, befell, myself, and, my, country, helping, settlers, move, westward, were, the, emigrant, guide, books, of, the, 1840s, featuring, route,

highway, a, trade, route, which, carried, american, manufactured, goods, southward, deep, into, mexico, and, returned, silver, furs, and, mules, northward, not, to, be, confused, with, another,

the, old, spanish, trail, the, spanish, and, mexican, governments, attracted, american, settlers, to, texas, with, generous, terms, stephen, f, austin, became, an, empresario, receiving, contracts, from, the, mexican, officials, to, bring, in, immigrants, in, doing, so, he, also, became, the, de, facto, political, and, military, commander, of, the, area, tensions, rose, however, after, an, abortive, attempt, to, establish, the, independent, nation, of, fredonia, in, 1826, william, travis, leading, the, war, party, advocated, for, independence, from, mexico, while, the, peace, party, led, by, austin, attempted, to, get, more, autonomy, within, the, current, relationship, when, mexican, president, santa, anna, shifted, alliances, and, joined, the, conservative, centralist, party, he, declared, himself, dictator, and, ordered, soldiers, into, texas, to, curtail, new, immigration, and, unrest, however, immigration, continued, and, 30, 000, anglos, with, 3, 000, slaves, were, settled, in, texas, by, 1835, in, 1836, the, texas, revolution, erupted, following, losses, at, the, alamo, and, goliad, the, texians, won, the, decisive, battle, of, san, jacinto, to, secure, independence, at, san, jacinto, sam, houston, commander, in, chief, of, the, texian, army, and, future, president, of, the, republic, of, texas, famously, shouted, remember, the, alamo, remember, goliad, the, u, s, congress, declined, to, annex, texas, stalemated, by, contentious, arguments, over, slavery, and, regional, power, thus, the, republic, of, texas, remained, an, independent, power, for, nearly, a, decade, before, it, was, annexed, as, the, 28th, state, in, 1845, the, government, of, mexico, however, viewed, texas, as, a, runaway, province, and, asserted, its, ownership, mexico, refused, to, recognize, the, independence, of, texas, in, 1836, but, the, u, s, and, european, powers, did, so, mexico, threatened, war, if, texas, joined, the, u, s, which, it, did, in, 1845, american, negotiators, were, turned, away, by, a, mexican, government, in, turmoil, when, the, mexican, army, killed, 16, american, soldiers, in, disputed, territory, war, was, at, hand, whigs, such, as, congressman, abraham, lincoln, denounced, the, war, but, it, was, quite, popular, outside, new, england, the, mexican, strategy, was, defensive, the, american, strategy, was, a, three, pronged, offensive, using, large, numbers, of, volunteer, soldiers, overland, forces, seized, new, mexico, with, little, resistance, and, headed, to, california, which, quickly, fell, to, the, american, land, and, naval, forces, from, the, main, american, base, at, new, orleans, general, zachary, taylor, led, forces, into, northern, mexico, winning, a, series, of, battles, that, ensued, the, u, s, navy,

eight, million, mexicans, with, their, idol, worship, heathen, superstition, and, degraded, mongrel, races, the, treaty, of, guadalupe, hidalgo, of, 1848, ceded, the, territories, of, california, and, new, mexico, to, the, united, states, for, 18, 5, million, which, included, the, assumption, of, claims, against, mexico, by, settlers, the, gadsden, purchase, in, 1853, added, southern, arizona,

particularly, over, the, wilmot, proviso, which, would, have, outlawed, slavery, in, the, new, territories, congress, never, passed, it, but, rather, temporarily, resolved, the, issue, of, slavery, in, the, west, with, the, compromise, of, 1850, california, entered, the, union, in, 1850, as, a, free, state, the, other, areas, remained, territories, for, many, years, the, new, state, grew, rapidly, as, migrants, poured, into, the, fertile, cotton, lands, of, east, texas, german, immigrants, started, to, arrive, in, the, early, 1840s, because, of, negative, economic, social, and, political, pressures, in, germany, with, their, investments, in, cotton, lands, and, slaves, planters, established, cotton, plantations, in, the, eastern, districts, the, central, area, of, the, state, was, developed, more, by, subsistence, farmers, who, seldom, owned, slaves, texas, in, its, wild, west, days, attracted, men, who, could, shoot, straight, and, possessed, the, zest, for, adventure, for, masculine, renown, patriotic, service, martial, glory, and, meaningful, deaths, in, 1846, about, 10, 000, californios, hispanics, lived, in, california, primarily, on, cattle, ranches, in, what, is, now, the, los, angeles, area, a, few, hundred, foreigners, were, scattered, in, the, northern, districts, including, some, americans, with, the, outbreak, of, war, with, mexico, in, 1846, the, u, s, sent, in, fr, mont, and, a, u, s, army, unit, as, well, as, naval, forces, and, quickly, took, control, as, the, war, was, ending, gold, was, discovered, in, the, north, and, the,

california, trail, the, population, soared, to, over, 200, 000, in, 1852, mostly, in, the, gold, districts, that, stretched, into, the, mountains, east, of, san, francisco, housing, in, san,

were, primitive, though, the, mild, climate, proved, attractive, supplies, were, expensive, and, food, poor, typical, diets, consisting, mostly, of, pork, beans, and, whiskey, these, highly, male, transient, communities, with, no, established, institutions, were, prone, to, high, levels, of, violence, drunkenness, profanity, and, greed, driven, behavior, without, courts, or, law, officers, in, the, mining, communities, to, enforce, claims, and, justice, miners, developed, their, ad, hoc, legal, system, based, on, the, mining, codes, used, in, other, mining, communities, abroad, each, camp,

000, miners, found, a, total, of, more, than, 200, million, in, gold, in, the, five, years, of, the, california, gold, rush, as, thousands, arrived, however, fewer, and, fewer, miners, struck, their, fortune, and, most, ended, exhausted, and, broke, violent, bandits, often, preyed, upon, the, miners, such, as, the, case, of, jonathan, r, davis, killing, of, eleven, bandits, single, handedly, camps, spread, out, north, and, south, of, the, american, river, and, eastward, into, the, sierras, in, a, few, years, nearly, all, of, the, independent, miners, were, displaced, as, mines, were, purchased, and, run, by, mining, companies, who, then, hired, low, paid, salaried, miners, as, gold, became, harder, to, find, and, more, difficult, to, extract, individual, prospectors, gave, way, to, paid, work, gangs, specialized, skills, and, mining, machinery, bigger, mines, however, caused, greater, environmental, damage, in, the, mountains, shaft, mining, predominated, producing, large, amounts, of, waste, beginning, in, 1852, at, the, end, of, the, 49, gold, rush, through, 1883, hydraulic, mining, was, used, despite, huge, profits, being, made, it, fell, into, the, hands, of, a,

up, overnight, most, became, ghost, towns, when, the, ores, were, depleted, prospectors, spread, out, and, hunted, for, gold, and, silver, along, the, rockies, and, in, the, southwest, soon, gold, was, discovered, in, colorado, utah, arizona, new, mexico, idaho, montana, and, south, dakota, by, 1864, the, discovery, of, the, comstock, lode, containing, vast, amounts, of, silver, resulted, in, the, nevada, boomtowns, of, virginia, city, carson, city, and, silver, city, the, wealth, from, silver, more, than, from, gold, fueled, the, maturation, of, san, francisco, in, the, 1860s, and, helped, the, rise, of, some, of, its, wealthiest, families, such, as, that, of, george, hearst, to, get, to, the, rich, new, lands, of, the, west, coast, there, were, three, options, some, sailed, around, the, southern, tip, of, south, america, during, a, six, month, voyage, some, took, the, treacherous, journey, across, the, panama, isthmus, but, 400, 000, others, walked, there, on, an, overland, route, of, more, than, 2, 000, miles, 3, 200, km, their, wagon, trains, usually, left, from, missouri, they, moved, in, large, groups, under, an, experienced, wagonmaster, bringing, their, clothing, farm, supplies, weapons, and, animals, these, wagon, trains, followed, major, rivers, crossed, prairies, and, mountains, and, typically, ended, in, oregon, and, california, pioneers, generally, attempted, to, complete, the, journey, during, a, single, warm, season, usually, for, six, months, by, 1836, when, the, first, migrant, wagon, train, was, organized, in, independence, missouri, a, wagon, trail, had, been, cleared, to, fort, hall, idaho, trails, were, cleared, further, and, further, west, eventually, reaching, the, willamette, valley, in, oregon, this, network, of, wagon, trails, leading, to, the, pacific, northwest, was, later, called, the, oregon, trail, the, eastern, half, of, the, route, was, also, used, by, travelers, on, the, california, trail, from, 1843, mormon, trail, from, 1847, and, bozeman, trail, from, 1863, before, they, turned, off, to, their, separate, destinations, in, the, wagon, train, of, 1843, some, 700, to, 1, 000, emigrants, headed, for, oregon, missionary, marcus, whitman, led, the, wagons, on, the, last, leg, in, 1846, the, barlow, road, was, completed, around, mount, hood, providing, a, rough, but, passable, wagon, trail, from, the, missouri, river, to, the, willamette, valley, about, 2, 000, miles, 3, 200, km, though, the, main, direction, of, travel, on, the, early, wagon, trails, was, westward, people, also, used, the, oregon, trail, to, travel, eastward, some, did, so, because, they, were, discouraged, and, defeated, some, returned, with, bags, of, gold, and, silver, most, were, returning, to, pick, up, their, families, and, move, them, all, back, west, these, gobacks, were, a, major, source, of, information, and, excitement, about, the, wonders, and, promises, and, dangers, and, disappointments, of, the, far, west, not, all, emigrants, made, it, to, their, destination, the, dangers, of, the, overland, route, were, numerous, snakebites, wagon, accidents, violence, from, other, travelers, suicide, malnutrition, stampedes, native, attacks, a, variety, of, diseases, dysentery, typhoid, and, cholera, were, among, the, most, common, exposure, avalanches, etc, one, particularly, well, known, example, of, the, treacherous, nature, of, the, journey, is, the, story, of, the, ill, fated, donner, party, which, became, trapped, in, the, sierra, nevada, mountains, during, the, winter, of, 1846, 1847, half, of, the, 90, people, traveling, with, the, group, died, from, starvation, and, exposure, and, some, resorted, to, cannibalism, to, survive, another, story, of, cannibalism, featured, alferd, packer, and, his, trek, to, colorado, in, 1874, there, were, also, frequent, attacks, from, bandits, and, highwaymen, such, as, the, infamous, harpe, brothers, who, patrolled, the, frontier, routes, and, targeted, migrant, groups, in, missouri, and, illinois, animosity, between, the, mormon, settlers, and, locals, grew, which, would, mirror, those, in, other, states, such, as, utah, years, later, violence, finally, erupted, on, october, 24, 1838, when, militias, from, both, sides, clashed, and, a, mass, killing, of, mormons, in, livingston, county, occurred, 6, days, later, a, mormon, extermination, order, was, filed, during, these, conflicts, and, the, mormons, were, forced, to, scatter, brigham, young, seeking, to, leave, american, jurisdiction, to, escape, religious, persecution, in, illinois, and, missouri, led, the, mormons, to, the, valley, of, the, great, salt, lake, owned, at, the, time, by, mexico, but, not, controlled, by, them, a, hundred, rural, mormon, settlements, sprang, up, in, what, young, called, deseret, which, he, ruled, as, a, theocracy, it, later, became, utah, territory, young, s, salt, lake, city, settlement, served, as, the, hub, of, their, network, which, reached, into, neighboring, territories, as, well, the, communalism, and, advanced, farming, practices, of, the, mormons, enabled, them, to, succeed, the, mormons, often, sold, goods, to, wagon, trains, passing, through, and, came, to, terms, with, local, native, tribes, because, young, decided, it, was, cheaper, to, feed, the, natives, than, fight, them, education, became, a, high, priority, to, protect, the, beleaguered, group, reduce, heresy, and, maintain, group, solidarity, following, the, end, of, the, mexican, american, war, in, 1848, utah, was, ceded, to, the, united, states, by, mexico, though, the, mormons, in, utah, had, supported, u, s, efforts, during, the, war, the, federal, government, pushed, by, the, protestant, churches, rejected, theocracy, and, polygamy, founded, in, 1852, the, republican, party, was, openly, hostile, towards, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, lds, church, in, utah, over, the, practice, of, polygamy, viewed, by, most, of, the, american, public, as, an, affront, to, religious, cultural, and, moral, values, of, modern, civilization, confrontations, verged, on, open, warfare, in, the, late, 1850s, as, president, buchanan, sent, in, troops, although, there, were, no, military, battles, fought, and, negotiations, led, to, a, stand, down, violence, still, escalated, and, there, were, several, casualties, after, the, civil, war, the, federal, government, systematically, took, control, of, utah, the, lds, church, was, legally, disincorporated, in, the, territory, and, members, of, the, church, s, hierarchy, including, young, were, summarily, removed, and, barred, from, virtually, every, public, office, meanwhile, successful, missionary, work, in, the, u, s, and, europe, brought, a, flood, of, mormon, converts, to, utah, during, this, time, congress, refused, to, admit, utah, into, the, union, as, a, state, and, statehood, would, mean, an, end, to, direct, federal, control, over, the, territory, and, the, possible, ascension, of, politicians, chosen, and, controlled, by, the, lds, church, into, most, if, not, all, federal, state, and, local, elected, offices, from, the, new, state, finally, in, 1890, the, church, leadership, announced, polygamy, was, no, longer, a, central, tenet, thereafter, a, compromise, in, 1896, utah, was, admitted, as, the, 45th, state, with, the, mormons, dividing, between, republicans, and, democrats, the, federal, government, provided, subsidies, for, the, development, of, mail, and, freight, delivery, and, by, 1856, congress, authorized, road, improvements, and, an, overland, mail, service, to, california, the, new, commercial, wagon, trains, service, primarily, hauled, freight, in, 1858, john, butterfield, 1801, 1869, established, a, stage, service, that, went, from, saint, louis, to, san, francisco, in, 24, days, along, a, southern, route, this, route, was, abandoned, in, 1861, after, texas, joined, the, confederacy, in, favor, of, stagecoach, services, established, via, fort, laramie, and, salt, lake, city, a, 24, day, journey, with, wells, fargo, co, as, the, foremost, provider, initially, using, the, old, butterfield, name, william, russell, hoping, to, get, a, government, contract, for, more, rapid, mail, delivery, service, started, the, pony, express, in, 1860, cutting, delivery, time, to, ten, days, he, set, up, over, 150, stations, about, 15, miles, 24, km, apart, in, 1861, congress, passed, the, land, grant, telegraph, act, which, financed, the, construction, of, western, union, s, transcontinental, telegraph, lines, hiram, sibley, western, union, s, head, negotiated, exclusive, agreements, with, railroads, to, run, telegraph, lines, along, their, right, of, way, eight, years, before, the, transcontinental, railroad, opened, the, first, transcontinental, telegraph, linked, omaha, nebraska, to, san, francisco, on, october, 24, 1861, the, pony, express, ended, in, just, 18, months, because, it, could, not, compete, with, the, telegraph, constitutionally, congress, could, not, deal, with, slavery, in, the, states, but, it, did, have, jurisdiction, in, the, western, territories, california, unanimously, rejected, slavery, in, 1850, and, became, a, free, state, new, mexico, allowed, slavery, but, it, was, rarely, seen, there, kansas, was, off, limits, to, slavery, by, the, compromise, of, 1820, free, soil, elements, feared, that, if, slavery, were, allowed, rich, planters, would, buy, up, the, best, lands, and, work, them, with, gangs, of, slaves, leaving, little, opportunity, for, free, white, men, to, own, farms, few, southern, planters, were, interested, in, kansas, but, the, idea, that, slavery, was, illegal, there, implied, they, had, a, second, class, status, that, was, intolerable, to, their, sense, of, honor, and, seemed, to, violate, the, principle, of, states, rights, with, the, passage, of, the, extremely, controversial, kansas, nebraska, act, in, 1854, congress, left, the, decision, up, to, the, voters, on, the, ground, in, kansas, across, the, north, a, new, major, party, was, formed, to, fight, slavery, the, republican, party, with, numerous, westerners, in, leadership, positions, most, notably, abraham, lincoln, of, illinois, to, influence, the, territorial, decision, anti, slavery, elements, also, called, jayhawkers, or, free, soilers, financed, the, migration, of, politically, determined, settlers, but, pro, slavery, advocates, fought, back, with, pro, slavery, settlers, from, missouri, violence, on, both, sides, was, the, result, in, all, 56, men, were, killed, by, the, time, the, violence, abated, in, 1859, by, 1860, the, pro, slavery, forces, were, in, control, but, kansas, had, only, two, slaves, the, antislavery, forces, took, over, by, 1861, as, kansas, became, a, free, state, the, episode, demonstrated, that, a, democratic, compromise, between, north, and, south, over, slavery, was, impossible, and, served, to, hasten, the, civil, war, despite, its, large, territory, the, trans, mississippi, west, had, a, small, population, and, its, wartime, story, has, to, a, large, extent, been, underplayed, in, the, historiography, of, the, american, civil, war, the, confederacy, engaged, in, several, important, campaigns, in, the, west, however, kansas, a, major, area, of, conflict, building, up, to, the, war, was, the, scene, of, only, one, battle, at, mine, creek, but, its, proximity, to, confederate, lines, enabled, pro, confederate, guerrillas, such, as, quantrill, s, raiders, to, attack, union, strongholds, and, massacre, the, residents, in, texas, citizens, voted, to, join, the, confederacy, anti, war, germans, were, hanged, local, troops, took, over, the, federal, arsenal, in, san, antonio, with, plans, to, grab, the, territories, of, northern, new, mexico, utah, and, colorado, and, possibly, california, confederate, arizona, was, created, by, arizona, citizens, who, wanted, protection, against, apache, raids, after, the, united, states, army, units, were, moved, out, the, confederacy, then, sets, its, sight, to, gain, control, of, the, new, mexico, territory, general, henry, hopkins, sibley, was, tasked, for, the, campaign, and, together, with, his, new, mexico, army, marched, right, up, the, rio, grande, in, an, attempt, to, take, the, mineral, wealth, of, colorado, as, well, as, california, the, first, regiment, of, volunteers, discovered, the, rebels, and, they, immediately, warned, and, joined, the, yankees, at, fort, union, the, battle, of, glorieta, pass, soon, erupted, and, the, union, ended, the, confederate, campaign, and, the, area, west, of, texas, remained, in, union, hands, missouri, a, border, south, state, where, slavery, was, legal, became, a, battleground, when, the, pro, secession, governor, against, the, vote, of, the, legislature, led, troops, to, the, federal, arsenal, at, st, louis, he, was, aided, by, confederate, forces, from, arkansas, and, louisiana, the, governor, of, missouri, and, part, of, the, state, legislature, signed, an, ordinance, of, secession, at, neosho, forming, the, confederate, government, of, missouri, and, the, confederacy, controlling, southern, missouri, however, union, general, samuel, curtis, regained, st, louis, and, all, of, missouri, for, the, union, the, state, was, the, scene, of, numerous, raids, and, guerrilla, warfare, in, the, west, the, u, s, army, after, 1850, established, a, series, of, military, posts, across, the, frontier, designed, to, stop, warfare, among, native, tribes, or, between, natives, and, settlers, throughout, the, 19th, century, army, officers, typically, built, their, careers, in, peacekeeper, roles, moving, from, fort, to, fort, until, retirement, actual, combat, experience, was, uncommon, for, any, one, soldier, the, most, dramatic, conflict, was, the, sioux, war, in, minnesota, in, 1862, when, dakota, tribes, systematically, attacked, german, farms, to, drive, out, the, settlers, for, several, days, dakota, attacks, at, the, lower, sioux, agency, new, ulm, and, hutchinson, killed, 300, to, 400, white, settlers, the, state, militia, fought, back, and, lincoln, sent, in, federal, troops, the, ensuing, battles, at, fort, ridgely, birch, coulee, fort, abercrombie, and, wood, lake, punctuated, a, six, week, war, which, ended, in, an, american, victory, the, federal, government, tried, 425, natives, for, murder, and, 303, were, convicted, and, sentenced, to, death, lincoln, pardoned, the, majority, but, 38, leaders, were, hanged, the, decreased, presence, of, union, troops, in, the, west, left, behind, untrained, militias, hostile, tribes, used, the, opportunity, to, attack, settlers, the, militia, struck, back, hard, most, notably, by, attacking, the, winter, quarters, of, the, cheyenne, and, arapaho, tribes, filled, with, women, and, children, at, the, sand, creek, massacre, in, eastern, colorado, in, late, 1864, kit, carson, and, the, u, s, army, in, 1864, trapped, the, entire, navajo, tribe, in, new, mexico, where, they, had, been, raiding, settlers, and, put, them, on, a, reservation, within, the, indian, territory, now, oklahoma, conflicts, arose, among, the, five, civilized, tribes, most, of, which, sided, with, the, south, being, slaveholders, themselves, in, 1862, congress, enacted, two, major, laws, to, facilitate, settlement, of, the, west, the, homestead, act, and, the, pacific, railroad, act, the, result, by, 1890, was, millions, of, new, farms, in, the, plains, states, many, operated, by, new, immigrants, from, germany, and, scandinavia, with, the, war, over, and, slavery, abolished, the, federal, government, focused, on, improving, the, governance, of, the, territories, it, subdivided, several, territories, preparing, them, for, statehood, following, the, precedents, set, by, the, northwest, ordinance, of, 1787, it, standardized, procedures, and, the, supervision, of, territorial, governments, taking, away, some, local, powers, and, imposing, much, red, tape, growing, the, federal, bureaucracy, significantly, federal, involvement, in, the, territories, was, considerable, in, addition, to, direct, subsidies, the, federal, government, maintained, military, posts, provided, safety, from, native, attacks, bankrolled, treaty, obligations, conducted, surveys, and, land, sales, built, roads, staffed, land, offices, made, harbor, improvements, and, subsidized, overland, mail, delivery, territorial, citizens, came, to, both, decry, federal, power, and, local, corruption, and, at, the, same, time, lament, that, more, federal, dollars, were, not, sent, their, way, territorial, governors, were, political, appointees, and, beholden, to, washington, so, they, usually, governed, with, a, light, hand, allowing, the, legislatures, to, deal, with, the, local, issues, in, addition, to, his, role, as, civil, governor, a, territorial, governor, was, also, a, militia, commander, a, local, superintendent, of, native, affairs, and, the, state, liaison, with, federal, agencies, the, legislatures, on, the, other, hand, spoke, for, the, local, citizens, and, they, were, given, considerable, leeway, by, the, federal, government, to, make, local, law, these, improvements, to, governance, still, left, plenty, of, room, for, profiteering, as, mark, twain, wrote, while, working, for, his, brother, the, secretary, of, nevada, the, government, of, my, country, snubs, honest, simplicity, but, fondles, artistic, villainy, and, i, think, i, might, have, developed, into, a, very, capable, pickpocket, if, i, had, remained, in, the, public, service, a, year, or, two, territorial, rings, corrupt, associations, of, local, politicians, and, business, owners, buttressed, with, federal, patronage, embezzled, from, native, tribes, and, local, citizens, especially, in, the, dakota, and, new, mexico, territories, in, acquiring, preparing, and, distributing, public, land, to, private, ownership, the, federal, government, generally, followed, the, system, set, forth, by, the, land, ordinance, of, 1785, federal, exploration, and, scientific, teams, would, undertake, reconnaissance, of, the, land, and, determine, native, american, habitation, through, treaties, the, land, titles, would, be, ceded, by, the, resident, tribes, then, surveyors, would, create, detailed, maps, marking, the, land, into, squares, of, six, miles, 10, km, on, each, side, subdivided, first, into, one, square, mile, blocks, then, into, 160, acre, 0, 65, km, 2, lots, townships, would, be, formed, from, the, lots, and, sold, at, public, auction, unsold, land, could, be, purchased, from, the, land, office, at, a, minimum, price, of, 1, 25, per, acre, as, part, of, public, policy, the, government, would, award, public, land, to, certain, groups, such, as, veterans, through, the, use, of, land, script, the, script, traded, in, a, financial, market, often, at, below, the, 1, 25, per, acre, minimum, price, set, by, law, which, gave, speculators, investors, and, developers, another, way, to, acquire, large, tracts, of, land, cheaply, land, policy, became, politicized, by, competing, factions, and, interests, and, the, question, of, slavery, on, new, lands, was, contentious, as, a, counter, to, land, speculators, farmers, formed, claims, clubs, to, enable, them, to, buy, larger, tracts, than, the, 160, acre, 0, 65, km, 2, allotments, by, trading, among, themselves, at, controlled, prices, in, 1862, congress, passed, three, important, bills, that, transformed, the, land, system, the, homestead, act, granted, 160, acres, 0, 65, km, 2, free, to, each, settler, who, improved, the, land, for, five, years, citizens, and, non, citizens, including, squatters, and, women, were, all, eligible, the, only, cost, was, a, modest, filing, fee, the, law, was, especially, important, in, the, settling, of, the, plains, states, many, took, a, free, homestead, and, others, purchased, their, land, from, railroads, at, low, rates, the, pacific, railroad, act, of, 1862, provided, for, the, land, needed, to, build, the, transcontinental, railroad, the, land, was, given, the, railroads, alternated, with, government, owned, tracts, saved, for, free, distribution, to, homesteaders, to, be, equitable, the, federal, government, reduced, each, tract, to, 80, acres, 32, ha, because, of, its, perceived, higher, value, given, its, proximity, to, the, rail, line, railroads, had, up, to, five, years, to, sell, or, mortgage, their, land, after, tracks, were, laid, after, which, unsold, land, could, be, purchased, by, anyone, often, railroads, sold, some, of, their, government, acquired, land, to, homesteaders, immediately, to, encourage, settlement, and, the, growth, of, markets, the, railroads, would, then, be, able, to, serve, nebraska, railroads, in, the, 1870s, were, strong, boosters, of, lands, along, their, routes, they, sent, agents, to, germany, and, scandinavia, with, package, deals, that, included, cheap, transportation, for, the, family, as, well, as, its, furniture, and, farm, tools, and, they, offered, long, term, credit, at, low, rates, boosterism, succeeded, in, attracting, adventurous, american, and, european, families, to, nebraska, helping, them, purchase, land, grant, parcels, on, good, terms, the, selling, price, depended, on, such, factors, as, soil, quality, water, and, distance, from, the, railroad, the, morrill, act, of, 1862, provided, land, grants, to, states, to, begin, colleges, of, agriculture, and, mechanical, arts, engineering, black, colleges, became, eligible, for, these, land, grants, in, 1890, the, act, succeeded, in, its, goals, to, open, new, universities, and, make, farming, more, scientific, and, profitable, in, the, 1850s, the, u, s, government, sponsored, surveys, that, charted, the, remaining, unexplored, regions, of, the, west, in, order, to, plan, possible, routes, for, a, transcontinental, railroad, much, of, this, work, was, undertaken, by, the, corps, of, engineers, corps, of, topographical, engineers, and, bureau, of, explorations, and, surveys, and, became, known, as, the, great, reconnaissance, regionalism, animated, debates, in, congress, regarding, the, choice, of, a, northern, central, or, southern, route, engineering, requirements, for, the, rail, route, were, an, adequate, supply, of, water, and, wood, and, as, nearly, level, route, as, possible, given, the, weak, locomotives, of, the, era, proposals, to, build, a, transcontinental, failed, because, of, congressional, disputes, over, slavery, with, the, secession, of, the, confederate, states, in, 1861, the, modernizers, in, the, republican, party, took, over, congress, and, wanted, a, line, to, link, to, california, private, companies, were, to, build, and, operate, the, line, construction, would, be, done, by, unskilled, laborers, who, would, live, in, temporary, camps, along, the, way, immigrants, from, china, and, ireland, did, most, of, the, construction, work, theodore, judah, the, chief, engineer, of, the, central, pacific, surveyed, the, route, from, san, francisco, east, judah, s, tireless, lobbying, efforts, in, washington, were, largely, responsible, for, the, passage, of, the, 1862, pacific, railroad, act, which, authorized, construction, of, both, the, central, pacific, and, the, union, pacific, which, built, west, from, omaha, in, 1862, four, rich, san, francisco, merchants, leland, stanford, collis, huntington,

there, were, no, federal, cash, subsidies, but, there, was, a, loan, to, the, central, pacific, that, was, eventually, repaid, at, six, percent, interest, the, federal, government, offered, land, grants, in, a, checkerboard, pattern, the, railroad, sold, every, other, square, with, the, government, opening, its, half, to, homesteaders, the, government, also, loaned, money, later, repaid, at,

used, the, latter, in, the, more, menial, and, dangerous, jobs, such, as, the, handling, and, the, pouring, of, nitroglycerin, however, the, railroad, also, provided, camps, and, food, the, chinese, wanted, and, protected, the, chinese, workers, from, threats, from, whites, building, the, railroad, required, six, main, activities, surveying, the, route, blasting, a, right, of, way, building,

several, years, the, railroads, had, immigration, bureaus, which, advertised, package, low, cost, deals, including, passage, and, land, on, easy, terms, for, farmers, in, germany, and, scandinavia, the, prairies, they, were, promised, did, not, mean, backbreaking, toil, because, settling, on, the, prairie, which, is, ready, for, the, plow, is, different, from, plunging, into, a, region, covered, with, timber, the, settlers, were, customers, of, the, railroads, shipping, their, crops, and, cattle, out, and, bringing, in, manufactured, products, all, manufacturers, benefited, from, the, lower, costs, of, transportation, and, the, much, larger, radius, of, business, white, concludes, with, a, mixed, verdict, the, transcontinentals, did, open, up, the, west, to, settlement, brought, in, many, thousands, of, high, tech, highly, paid, workers, and, managers, created, thousands, of, towns, and, cities, oriented, the, nation, onto, an, east, west, axis, and, proved, highly, valuable, for, the, nation, as, a, whole, on, the, other, hand, too, many, were, built, and, they, were, built, too, far, ahead, of, actual, demand, the, result, was, a, bubble, that, left, heavy, losses, to, investors, and, led, to, poor, management, practices, by, contrast, as, white, notes, the, lines, in, the, midwest, and, east, supported, by, a, very, large, population, base, fostered, farming, industry, and, mining, while, generating, steady, profits, and, receiving, few, government, benefits, after, the, civil, war, many, from, the, east, coast, and, europe, were, lured, west, by, reports, from, relatives, and, by, extensive, advertising, campaigns, promising, the, best, prairie, lands, low, prices, large, discounts, for, cash, and, better, terms, than, ever, the, new, railroads, provided, the, opportunity, for, migrants, to, go, out, and, take, a, look, with, special, family, tickets, the, cost, of, which, could, be, applied, to, land, purchases, offered, by, the, railroads, farming,

predictable, the, fearful, stayed, home, the, actual, migrants, looked, beyond, fears, of, the, unknown, their, chief, motivation, to, move, west, was, to, find, a, better, economic, life, than, the, one, they, had, farmers, sought, larger, cheaper, and, more, fertile, land, merchants, and, tradesmen, sought, new, customers, and, new, leadership, opportunities, laborers, wanted, higher, paying, work, and, better, conditions, as, settlers, moved, west, they, had, to, face, challenges, along, the, way, such, as, the, lack, of, wood, for, housing, bad, weather, like, blizzards, and, droughts, and, fearsome, tornadoes, in, the, treeless, prairies, homesteaders, built, sod, houses, one, of, the, greatest, plagues, that, hit, the, homesteaders, was, the, 1874, locust, plague, which, devastated, the, great, plains, these, challenges, hardened, these, settlers, in, taming, the, frontier, after, russia, s, defeat, in, the, crimean, war, tsar, alexander, ii, of, russia, decided, to, sell, the, russian, american, territory, of, alaska, to, the, united, states, the, decision, was, motivated, in, part, by, a, need, for, money, and, in, part, a, recognition, amongst, the, russian, state, that, britain, could, easily, capture, alaska, in, any, future, conflict, between, the, two, nations, u, s, secretary, of, state, william, seward, negotiated, with, the, russians, to, acquire, the, tremendous, landmass, of, alaska, an, area, roughly, one, fifth, the, size, of, the, rest, of, the, united, states, on, march, 30, 1867, the, u, s, purchased, the, territory, from, the, russians, for, 7, 2, million, 157, million, in, 2023, dollars, the, transfer, ceremony, was, completed, in, sitka, on, october, 18, 1867, as, russian, soldiers, handed, over, the, territory, to, the, united, states, army, critics, at, the, time, decried, the, purchase, as, seward, s, folly, reasoning, that, there, were, no, natural, resources, in, the, new, territory, and, no, one, can, be, bothered, to, live, in, such, a, cold, icy, climate, although, the, development, and, settlement, of, alaska, grew, slowly, the, discovery, of, goldfields, during, the, klondike, gold, rush, in, 1896, nome, gold, rush, in, 1898, and, fairbanks, gold, rush, in, 1902, brought, thousands, of, miners, into, the, territory, thus, propelling, alaska, s, prosperity, for, decades, to, come, major, oil, discoveries, in, the, late, 20th, century, made, the, state, rich, in, 1889, washington, opened, 2, 000, 000, acres, 8, 100, km, 2, of, unoccupied, lands, in, the, oklahoma, territory, on, april, 22, over, 100, 000, settlers, and, cattlemen, known, as, boomers, lined, up, at, the, border, and, when, the, army, s, guns, and, bugles, giving, the, signal, began, a, mad, dash, to, stake, their, claims, in, the, land, run, of, 1889, a, witness, wrote, the, horsemen, had, the, best, of, it, from, the, start, it, was, a, fine, race, for, a, few, minutes, but, soon, the, riders, began, to, spread, out, like, a, fan, and, by, the, time, they, reached, the, horizon, they, were, scattered, about, as, far, as, the, eye, could, see, in, a, single, day, the, towns, of, oklahoma, city, norman, and, guthrie, came, into, existence, in, the, same, manner, millions, of, acres, of, additional, land, were, opened, up, and, settled, in, the, following, four, years, indian, wars, have, occurred, throughout, the, united, states, though, the, conflicts, are, generally, separated, into, two, categories, the, indian, wars, east, of, the, mississippi, river, and, the, indian, wars, west, of, the, mississippi, the, u, s, bureau, of, the, census, 1894, provided, an, estimate, of, deaths, the, indian, wars, under, the, government, of, the, united, states, have, been, more, than, 40, in, number, they, have, cost, the, lives, of, about, 19, 000, white, men, women, and, children, including, those, killed, in, individual, combats, and, the, lives, of, about, 30, 000, indians, the, actual, number, of, killed, and, wounded, indians, must, be, very, much, higher, than, the, given, fifty, percent, additional, would, be, a, safe, estimate, historian, russell, thornton, estimates, that, from, 1800, to, 1890, the, native, population, declined, from, 600, 000, to, as, few, as, 250, 000, the, depopulation, was, principally, caused, by, disease, as, well, as, warfare, many, tribes, in, texas, such, as, the, karankawan, akokisa, bidui, and, others, were, extinguished, due, to, conflicts, with, texan, settlers, the, rapid, depopulation, of, the, native, americans, after, the, civil, war, alarmed, the, u, s, government, and, the, doolittle, committee, was, formed, to, investigate, the, causes, as, well, as, provide, recommendations, for, preserving, the, population, the, solutions, presented, by, the, committee, such, as, the, establishment, of, the, five, boards, of, inspection, to, prevent, native, abuses, had, little, effect, as, large, western, migration, commenced, the, expansion, of, migration, into, the, southeastern, united, states, in, the, 1820s, to, the, 1830s, forced, the, federal, government, to, deal, with, the, indian, question, the, natives, were, under, federal, control, but, were, independent, of, state, governments, state, legislatures, and, state, judges, had, no, authority, on, their, lands, and, the, states, demanded, control, politically, the, new, democratic, party, of, president, andrew, jackson, demanded, the, removal, of, the, natives, out, of, the, southeastern, states, to, new, lands, in, the, west, while, the, whig, party, and, the, protestant, churches, were, opposed, to, removal, the, jacksonian, democracy, proved, irresistible, as, it, won, the, presidential, elections, of, 1828, 1832, and, 1836, by, 1837, the, indian, removal, policy, began, to, implement, the, act, of, congress, signed, by, andrew, jackson, in, 1830, many, historians, have, sharply, attacked, jackson, the, 1830, law, theoretically, provided, for, voluntary, removal, and, had, safeguards, for, the, rights, of, natives, but, in, reality, the, removal, was, involuntary, brutal, and, ignored, safeguards, jackson, justified, his, actions, by, stating, that, natives, had, neither, the, intelligence, the, industry, the, moral, habits, nor, the, desire, of, improvements, the, forced, march, of, about, twenty, tribes, included, the, five, civilized, tribes, cherokee, chickasaw, choctaw, creek, and, seminole, to, motivate, natives, reluctant, to, move, the, federal, government, also, promised, rifles, blankets, tobacco, and, cash, by, 1835, the, cherokee, the, last, native, nation, in, the, south, had, signed, the, removal, treaty, and, relocated, to, oklahoma, all, the, tribes, were, given, new, land, in, the, indian, territory, which, later, became, oklahoma, of, the, approximate, 70, 000, natives, removed, about, 18, 000, died, from, disease, starvation, and, exposure, on, the, route, this, exodus, has, become, known, as, the, trail, of, tears, in, cherokee, nunna, dual, tsuny, the, trail, where, they, cried, the, impact, of, the, removals, was, severe, the, transplanted, tribes, had, considerable, difficulty, adapting, to, their, new, surroundings, and, sometimes, clashed, with, the, tribes, native, to, the, area, the, only, way, for, a, native, to, remain, and, avoid, removal, was, to, accept, the, federal, offer, of, 640, acres, 2, 6, km, 2, or, more, of, land, depending, on, family, size, in, exchange, for, leaving, the, tribe, and, becoming, a, state, citizen, subject, to, state, law, and, federal, law, however, many, natives, who, took, the, offer, were, defrauded, by, ravenous, speculators, who, stole, their, claims, and, sold, their, land, to, whites, in, mississippi, alone, fraudulent, claims, reached, 3, 800, 000, acres, 15, 000, km, 2, of, the, five, tribes, the, seminole, offered, the, most, resistance, hiding, out, in, the, florida, swamps, and, waging, a, war, which, cost, the, u, s, army, 1, 500, lives, and, 20, million, native, warriors, in, the, west, using, their, traditional, style, of, limited, battle, oriented, warfare, confronted, the, u, s, army, the, natives, emphasized, bravery, in, combat, while, the, army, put, its, emphasis, not, so, much, on, individual, combat, as, on, building, networks, of, forts, developing, a, logistics, system, and, using, the, telegraph, and, railroads, to, coordinate, and, concentrate, its, forces, plains, indian, intertribal, warfare, bore, no, resemblance, to, the, modern, warfare, practiced, by, the, americans, along, european, lines, using, its, vast, advantages, in, population, and, resources, many, tribes, avoided, warfare, and, others, supported, the, u, s, army, the, tribes, hostile, to, the, government, continued, to, pursue, their, traditional, brand, of, fighting, and, therefore, were, unable, to, have, any, permanent, success, against, the, army, indian, wars, were, fought, throughout, the, western, regions, with, more, conflicts, in, the, states, bordering, mexico, than, in, the, interior, states, arizona, ranked, highest, with, 310, known, battles, fought, within, the, state, s, boundaries, between, americans, and, the, natives, arizona, ranked, highest, in, war, deaths, with, 4, 340, killed, including, soldiers, civilians, and, native, americans, that, was, more, than, twice, as, many, as, occurred, in, texas, the, second, highest, ranking, state, most, of, the, deaths, in, arizona, were, caused, by, the, apache, michno, also, says, that, fifty, one, percent, of, the, indian, war, battles, between, 1850, and, 1890, took, place, in, arizona, texas, and, new, mexico, as, well, as, thirty, seven, percent, of, the, casualties, in, the, county, west, of, the, mississippi, river, the, comanche, fought, a, number, of, conflicts, against, spanish, and, later, mexican, and, american, armies, comanche, power, peaked, in, the, 1840s, when, they, conducted, large, scale, raids, hundreds, of, miles, into, mexico, proper, while, also, warring, against, the, anglo, americans, and, tejanos, who, had, settled, in, independent, texas, one, of, the, deadliest, indian, wars, fought, was, the, snake, war, in, 1864, 1868, which, was, conducted, by, a, confederacy, of, northern, paiute, bannock, and, shoshone, native, americans, called, the, snake, indians, against, the, united, states, army, in, the, states, of, oregon, nevada, california, and, idaho, which, ran, along, the, snake, river, the, war, started, when, tension, arose, between, the, local, natives, and, the, flooding, pioneer, trains, encroaching, through, their, lands, which, resulted, in, competition, for, food, and, resources, natives, included, in, this, group, attacked, and, harassed, emigrant, parties, and, miners, crossing, the, snake, river, valley, which, resulted, in, further, retaliation, of, the, white, settlements, and, the, intervention, of, the, united, states, army, the, war, resulted, in, a, total, of, 1, 762, men, who, have, been, killed, wounded, and, captured, from, both, sides, unlike, other, indian, wars, the, snake, war, has, widely, forgotten, in, united, states, history, due, to, having, only, limited, coverage, of, the, war, the, colorado, war, fought, by, cheyenne, arapaho, and, sioux, was, fought, in, the, territories, of, colorado, to, nebraska, the, conflict, was, fought, in, 1863, 1865, while, the, american, civil, war, was, still, ongoing, caused, by, dissolution, between, the, natives, and, the, white, settlers, in, the, region, the, war, was, infamous, for, the, atrocities, done, between, the, two, parties, white, militias, destroyed, native, villages, and, killed, native, women, and, children, such, as, the, bloody, sand, creek, massacre, and, the, natives, also, raided, ranches, farms, and, killed, white, families, such, as, the, american, ranch, massacre, and, raid, on, godfrey, ranch, in, the, apache, wars, colonel,

and, homes, and, capturing, or, killing, their, livestock, he, was, aided, by, other, native, tribes, with, long, standing, enmity, toward, the, navajos, chiefly, the, utes, another, prominent, conflict, of, this, war, was, geronimo, s, fight, against, settlements, in, texas, in, the, 1880s, the, apaches, under, his, command, conducted, ambushes, on, us, cavalries, and, forts, such, as, their, attack, on, cibecue, creek, while, also, raiding, upon, prominent, farms, and, ranches, such, as, their, infamous, attack, on, the, empire, ranch, that, killed, three, cowboys, the, u, s, finally, induced, the, last, hostile, apache, band, under, geronimo, to, surrender, in, 1886, during, the, comanche, campaign, the, red, river, war, was, fought, in, 1874, 1875, in, response, to, the, comanche, s, dwindling, food, supply, of, buffalo, as, well, as, the, refusal, of, a, few, bands, to, be, inducted, in, reservations, comanches, started, raiding, small, settlements, in, texas, which, led, to, the, battle, of, buffalo, wallow, and, second, battle, of, adobe, walls, fought, by, buffalo, hunters, and, the, battle, of, lost, valley, against, the, texas, rangers, the, war, finally, ended, with, a, final, confrontation, between, the, comanches, and, the, u, s, cavalry, in, palo, duro, canyon, the, last, comanche, war, chief, quanah, parker, surrendered, in, june, 1875, which,

committees, were, treated, cruelly, often, hung, or, shot, without, any, form, of, trial, civilians, also, took, arms, to, defend, themselves, in, the, old, west, sometimes, siding, with, lawmen, coffeyville, bank, robbery, or, siding, with, outlaws, battle, of, ingalls, in, the, post, civil, war, frontier, over, 523, whites, 34, blacks, and, 75, others, were, victims, of, lynching, however, cases, of, lynching, in, the, old, west, wasn, t, primarily, caused, by, the, absence, of, a, legal, system, but, also, because, of, social, class, historian, michael, j, pfeifer, writes, contrary, to, the, popular, understanding, early, territorial, lynching, did, not, flow, from, an, absence, or, distance, of, law, enforcement, but, rather, from, the, social, instability, of, early, communities, and, their, contest, for, property, status, and, the, definition, of, social, order, range, wars, were, infamous, armed, conflicts, that, took, place, in, the, open, range, of, the, american, frontier, the, subject, of, these, conflicts, was, the, control, of, lands, freely, used, for, farming, and, cattle, grazing, which, gave, the, conflict, its, name, range, wars, became, more, common, by, the, end, of, the, american, civil, war, and, numerous, conflicts, were, fought, such, as, the, pleasant, valley, war, johnson, county, war, pecos, war, mason, county, war, colorado, range, war, fence, cutting, war, colfax, county, war, castaic, range, war, spring, creek, raid, porum, range, war, barber, mizell, feud, san, elizario, salt, war, and, others, during, a, range, war, in, montana, a, vigilante, group, called, stuart, s, stranglers, which, were, made, up, of, cattlemen, and, cowboys, killed, up, to, 20, criminals, and, range, squatters, in, 1884, alone, in, nebraska, stock, grower, isom, olive, led, a, range, war, in, 1878, that, killed, a, number, of, homesteaders, from, lynchings, and, shootouts, before, eventually, leading, to, his, own, murder, another, infamous, type, of, open, range, conflict, were, the, sheep, wars, which, were, fought, between, sheep, ranchers, and, cattle, ranchers, over, grazing, rights, and, mainly, occurred, in, texas, arizona, and, the, border, region, of, wyoming, and, colorado, in, most, cases, formal, military, involvement, were, used, to, quickly, put, an, end, to, these, conflicts, other, conflicts, over, land, and, territory, were, also, fought, such, as, the, regulator, moderator, war, cortina, troubles, las, cuevas, war, and, the, bandit, war, feuds, involving, families, and, bloodlines, also, occurred, much, in, the, frontier, since, private, agencies, and, vigilance, committees, were, the, substitute, for, proper, courts, many, families, initially, depended, on, themselves, and, their, communities, for, their, security, and, justice, these, wars, include, the, lincoln, county, war, tutt, everett, war, flynn, doran, feud, early, hasley, feud, brooks, baxter, war, sutton, taylor, feud, horrell, brothers, feud, brooks, mcfarland, feud, reese, townsend, feud, and, the, earp, vendetta, ride, the, end, of, the, bison, herds, opened, up, millions, of, acres, for, cattle, ranching, spanish, cattlemen, had, introduced, cattle, ranching, and, longhorn, cattle, to, the, southwest, in, the, 17th, century, and, the, men, who, worked, the, ranches, called, vaqueros, were, the, first, cowboys, in, the, west, after, the, civil, war, texas, ranchers, raised, large, herds, of, longhorn, cattle, the, nearest, railheads, were, 800, or, more, miles, 1300, km, north, in, kansas, abilene, kansas, city, dodge, city, and, wichita, so, once, fattened, the, ranchers, and, their, cowboys, drove, the, herds, north, along, the, western, chisholm, and, shawnee, trails, the, cattle, were, shipped, to, chicago, st, louis, and, points, east, for, slaughter, and, consumption, in, the, fast, growing, cities, the, chisholm, trail, laid, out, by, cattleman, joseph, mccoy, along, an, old, trail, marked, by, jesse, chisholm, was, the, major, artery, of, cattle, commerce, carrying, over, 1, 5, million, head, of, cattle, between, 1867, and, 1871, over, the, 800, miles, 1, 300, km, from, south, texas, to, abilene, kansas, the, long, drives, were, treacherous, especially, crossing, water, such, as, the, brazos, and, the, red, river, and, when, they, had, to, fend, off, natives, and, rustlers, looking, to, make, off, with, their, cattle, a, typical, drive, would, take, three, to, four, months, and, contained, two, miles, 3, km, of, cattle, six, abreast, despite, the, risks, a, successful, drive, proved, very, profitable, to, everyone, involved, as, the, price, of, one, steer, was, 4, in, texas, and, 40, in, the, east, by, the, 1870s, and, 1880s, cattle, ranches, expanded, further, north, into, new, grazing, grounds, and, replaced, the, bison, herds, in, wyoming, montana, colorado, nebraska, and, the, dakota, territory, using, the, rails, to, ship, to, both, coasts, many, of, the, largest, ranches, were, owned, by, scottish, and, english, financiers, the, single, largest, cattle, ranch, in, the, entire, west, was, owned, by, american, john, w, iliff, cattle, king, of, the, plains, operating, in, colorado, and, wyoming, gradually, longhorns, were, replaced, by, the, british, breeds, of, hereford, and, angus, introduced, by, settlers, from, the, northwest, though, less, hardy, and, more, disease, prone, these, breeds, produced, better, tasting, beef, and, matured, faster, the, funding, for, the, cattle, industry, came, largely, from, british, sources, as, the, european, investors, engaged, in, a, speculative, extravaganza, a, bubble, graham, concludes, the, mania, was, founded, on, genuine, opportunity, as, well, as, exaggeration, gullibility, inadequate, communications, dishonesty, and, incompetence, a, severe, winter, engulfed, the, plains, toward, the, end, of, 1886, and, well, into, 1887, locking, the, prairie, grass, under, ice, and, crusted, snow, which, starving, herds, could, not, penetrate, the, british, lost, most, of, their, money, as, did, eastern, investors, like, theodore, roosevelt, but, their, investments, did, create, a, large, industry, that, continues, to, cycle, through, boom, and, bust, periods, on, a, much, smaller, scale, sheep, grazing, was, locally, popular, sheep, were, easier, to, feed, and, needed, less, water, however, americans, did, not, eat, mutton, as, farmers, moved, in, open, range, cattle, ranching, came, to, an, end, and, was, replaced, by, barbed, wire, spreads, where, water, breeding, feeding, and, grazing, could, be, controlled, this, led, to, fence, wars, which, erupted, over, disputes, about, water, rights, anchoring, the, booming, cattle, industry, of, the, 1860s, and, 1870s, were, the, cattle, towns, in, kansas, and, missouri, like, the, mining, towns, in, california, and, nevada, cattle, towns, such, as, abilene, dodge, city, and, ellsworth, experienced, a, short, period, of, boom, and, bust, lasting, about, five, years, the, cattle, towns, would, spring, up, as, land, speculators, would, rush, in, ahead, of, a, proposed, rail, line, and, build, a, town, and, the, supporting, services, attractive, to, the, cattlemen, and, the, cowboys, if, the, railroads, complied, the, new, grazing, ground, and, supporting, town, would, secure, the, cattle, trade, however, unlike, the, mining, towns, which, in, many, cases, became, ghost, towns, and, ceased, to, exist, after, the, ore, played, out, cattle, towns, often, evolved, from, cattle, to, farming, and, continued, after, the, grazing, lands, were, exhausted, the, concern, with, the, protection, of, the, environment, became, a, new, issue, in, the, late, 19th, century, pitting, different, interests, on, the, one, side, were, the, lumber, and, coal, companies, who, called, for, maximum, exploitation, of, natural, resources, to, maximize, jobs, economic, growth, and, their, own, profit, in, the, center, were, the, conservationists, led, by, theodore, roosevelt, and, his, coalition, of, outdoorsmen, sportsmen, bird, watchers, and, scientists, they, wanted, to, reduce, waste, emphasized, the, value, of, natural, beauty, for, tourism, and, ample, wildlife, for, hunters, and, argued, that, careful, management, would, not, only, enhance, these, goals, but, also, increase, the, long, term, economic, benefits, to, society, by, planned, harvesting, and, environmental, protections, roosevelt, worked, his, entire, career, to, put, the, issue, high, on, the, national, agenda, he, was, deeply, committed, to, conserving, natural, resources, he, worked, closely, with, gifford, pinchot, and, used, the, newlands, reclamation, act, of, 1902, to, promote, federal, construction, of, dams, to, irrigate, small, farms, and, placed, 230, million, acres, 360, 000, mi, 2, or, 930, 000, km, 2, under, federal, protection, roosevelt, set, aside, more, federal, land, national, parks, and, nature, preserves, than, all, of, his, predecessors, combined, roosevelt, explained, his, position, in, 1910, conservation, means, development, as, much, as, it, does, protection, i, recognize, the, right, and, duty, of, this, generation, to, develop, and, use, the, natural, resources, of, our, land, but, i, do, not, recognize, the, right, to, waste, them, or, to, rob, by, wasteful, use, the, generations, that, come, after, us, the, third, element, smallest, at, first, but, growing, rapidly, after, 1870, were, the, environmentalists, who, honored, nature, for, its, own, sake, and, rejected, the, goal, of, maximizing, human, benefits, their, leader, was, john, muir, 1838, 1914, a, widely, read, author, and, naturalist, and, pioneer, advocate, of, preservation, of, wilderness, for, its, own, sake, and, founder, of, the, sierra, club, muir, a, scottish, american, based, in, california, in, 1889, started, organizing, support, to, preserve, the, sequoias, in, the, yosemite, valley, congress, did, pass, the, yosemite, national, park, bill, 1890, in, 1897, president, grover, cleveland, created, thirteen, protected, forests, but, lumber, interests, had, congress, cancel, the, move, muir, taking, the, persona, of, an, old, testament, prophet, crusaded, against, the, lumberman, portraying, it, as, a, contest, between, landscape, righteousness, and, the, devil, a, master, publicist, muir, s, magazine, articles, in, harper, s, weekly, june, 5, 1897, and, the, atlantic, monthly, turned, the, tide, of, public, sentiment, he, mobilized, public, opinion, to, support, roosevelt, s, program, of, setting, aside, national, monuments, national, forest, reserves, and, national, parks, however, muir, broke, with, roosevelt, and, especially, president, william, howard, taft, on, the, hetch, hetchy, dam, which, was, built, in, the, yosemite, national, park, to, supply, water, to, san, francisco, biographer, donald, worster, says, saving, the, american, soul, from, a, total, surrender, to, materialism, was, the, cause, for, which, he, fought, the, rise, of, the, cattle, industry, and, the, cowboy, is, directly, tied, to, the, demise, of, the, huge, herds, of, bison, usually, called, the, buffalo, once, numbering, over, 25, million, on, the, great, plains, the, grass, eating, herds, were, a, vital, resource, animal, for, the, plains, indians, providing, food, hides, for, clothing, and, shelter, and, bones, for, implements, loss, of, habitat, disease, and, over, hunting, steadily, reduced, the, herds, through, the, 19th, century, to, the, point, of, near, extinction, the, last, 10, 15, million, died, out, in, a, decade, 1872, 1883, only, 100, survived, the, tribes, that, depended, on, the, buffalo, had, little, choice, but, to, accept, the, government, offer, of, reservations, where, the, government, would, feed, and, supply, them, conservationists, founded, the, american, bison, society, in, 1905, it, lobbied, congress, to, establish, public, bison, herds, several, national, parks, in, the, u, s, and, canada, were, created, in, part, to, provide, a, sanctuary, for, bison, and, other, large, wildlife, the, bison, population, reached, 500, 000, by, 2003, following, the, 1890, u, s, census, the, superintendent, announced, that, there, was, no, longer, a, clear, line, of, advancing, settlement, and, hence, no, longer, a, contiguous, frontier, in, the, continental, united, states, when, examining, the, later, 1900, u, s, census, population, distribution, results, though, the, contiguous, frontier, line, does, remain, but, by, the, 1910, u, s, census, only, pockets, of, the, frontier, remain, without, a, clear, westward, line, allowing, travel, across, the, continent, without, ever, crossing, a, frontier, line, virgin, farmland, was, increasingly, hard, to, find, after, 1890, although, the, railroads, advertised, some, in, eastern, montana, bicha, shows, that, nearly, 600, 000, american, farmers, sought, cheap, land, by, moving, to, the, prairie, frontier, of, the, canadian, west, from, 1897, to, 1914, however, about, two, thirds, of, them, grew, disillusioned, and, returned, to, the, u, s, despite, this, homesteaders, claimed, more, land, in, the, first, two, decades, of, the, 20th, century, than, the, 19th, century, the, homestead, acts, and, proliferation, of, railroads, are, often, credited, as, being, important, factors, in, shrinking, the, frontier, by, efficiently, bringing, in, settlers, and, required, infrastructure, the, increased, size, of, land, grants, from, 160, to, 320, acres, in, 1909, and, then, rangeland, to, 640, acres, in, 1916, accelerated, this, process, barbed, wire, is, also, reasoned, to, reduce, the, traditional, open, range, in, addition, the, growing, adoption, of, automobiles, and, their, required, network, of, adequate, roads, first, federally, subsidized, by, the, federal, aid, highway, act, of, 1916, solidified, the, frontier, s, end, the, admission, of, oklahoma, as, a, state, in, 1907, upon, the, combination, of, the, oklahoma, territory, and, the, last, remaining, indian, territory, and, the, arizona, and, new, mexico, territories, as, states, in, 1912, marks, the, end, of, the, frontier, story, for, many, scholars, due, to, their, low, and, uneven, populations, during, this, period, though, frontier, territory, remained, for, the, meantime, of, course, a, few, typical, frontier, episodes, still, happened, such, as, the, last, stagecoach, robbery, occurred, in, nevada, s, remaining, frontier, in, december, 1916, a, period, known, as, the, western, civil, war, of, incorporation, that, often, was, violent, lasted, from, the, 1850s, to, 1919, the, mexican, revolution, also, led, to, significant, conflict, reaching, across, the, us, mexico, border, which, was, still, mostly, within, frontier, territory, known, as, the, mexican, border, war, 1910, 1919, flashpoints, included, the, battle, of, columbus, 1916, and, the, punitive, expedition, 1916, 1917, the, bandit, war, 1915, 1919, involved, attacks, targeted, against, texan, settlers, also, skirmishes, involving, natives, happened, as, late, as, the, bluff, war, 1914, 1915, and, the, posey, war, 1923, the, westward, expansion, of, american, influence, and, jurisdiction, across, the, pacific, in, the, late, 19th, century, was, in, some, sense, a, new, asia, pacific, frontier, with, frederick, jackson, turner, arguing, this, to, be, a, necessary, element, of, the, u, s, s, growth, as, its, identity, as, a, civilized, and, ideals, based, nation, depended, on, constantly, overcoming, a, savage, other, alaska, was, not, admitted, as, a, state, until, 1959, the, ethos, and, storyline, of, the, american, frontier, had, passed, central, to, the, myth, and, the, reality, of, the, west, is, the, american, cowboy, in, actuality, the, life, of, a, cowboy, was, a, hard, one, and, revolved, around, two, annual, roundups, spring, and, fall, the, subsequent, drives, to, market, and, the, time, off, in, the, cattle, towns, spending, their, hard, earned, money, on, food, clothing, firearms, gambling, and, prostitution, during, winter, many, cowboys, hired, themselves, out, to, ranches, near, the, cattle, towns, where, they, repaired, and, maintained, equipment, and, buildings, working, the, cattle, was, not, just, a, routine, job, but, also, a, lifestyle, that, exulted, in, the, freedom, of, the, wide, unsettled, outdoors, on, horseback, long, drives, hired, one, cowboy, for, about, 250, head, of, cattle, saloons, were, ubiquitous, outside, mormondom, but, on, the, trail, the, cowboys, were, forbidden, to, drink, alcohol, often, hired, cowboys, were, trained, and, knowledgeable, in, their, trade, such, as, herding, ranching, and, protecting, cattle, to, protect, their, herd, from, wild, animals, hostile, natives, and, rustlers, cowboys, carried, with, them, their, iconic, weaponry, such, as, the, bowie, knife, lasso, bullwhip, revolvers, rifles, and, shotguns, many, of, the, cowboys, were, veterans, of, the, civil, war, a, diverse, group, they, included, blacks, hispanics, native, americans, and, immigrants, from, many, lands, the, earliest, cowboys, in, texas, learned, their, trade, adapted, their, clothing, and, took, their, jargon, from, the, mexican, vaqueros, or, buckaroos, the, heirs, of, spanish, cattlemen, from, the, middle, south, of, spain, chaps, the, heavy, protective, leather, trousers, worn, by, cowboys, got, their, name, from, the, spanish, chaparreras, and, the, lariat, or, rope, was, derived, from, la, reata, all, the, distinct, clothing, of, the, cowboy, boots, saddles, hats, pants, chaps, slickers, bandannas, gloves, and, collar, less, shirts, were, practical, and, adaptable, designed, for, protection, and, comfort, the, cowboy, hat, quickly, developed, the, capability, even, in, the, early, years, to, identify, its, wearer, as, someone, associated, with, the, west, it, came, to, symbolize, the, frontier, the, most, enduring, fashion, adapted, from, the, cowboy, popular, nearly, worldwide, today, are, blue, jeans, originally, made, by, levi, strauss, for, miners, in, 1850, before, a, drive, a, cowboy, s, duties, included, riding, out, on, the, range, and, bringing, together, the, scattered, cattle, the, best, cattle, would, be, selected, roped, and, branded, and, most, male, cattle, were, castrated, the, cattle, also, needed, to, be, dehorned, and, examined, and, treated, for, infections, on, the, long, drives, the, cowboys, had, to, keep, the, cattle, moving, and, in, line, the, cattle, had, to, be, watched, day, and, night, as, they, were, prone, to, stampedes, and, straying, while, camping, every, night, cowboys, would, often, sing, to, their, herd, to, keep, them, calm, the, workdays, often, lasted, fourteen, hours, with, just, six, hours, of, sleep, it, was, grueling, dusty, work, with, just, a, few, minutes, of, relaxation, before, and, at, the, end, of, a, long, day, on, the, trail, drinking, gambling, and, brawling, were, often, prohibited, and, fined, and, sometimes, cursing, as, well, it, was, monotonous, and, boring, work, with, food, to, match, bacon, beans, bread, coffee, dried, fruit, and, potatoes, on, average, cowboys, earned, 30, to, 40, per, month, because, of, the, heavy, physical, and, emotional, toll, it, was, unusual, for, a, cowboy, to, spend, more, than, seven, years, on, the, range, as, open, range, ranching, and, the, long, drives, gave, way, to, fenced, in, ranches, in, the, 1880s, by, the, 1890s, the, glory, days, of, the, cowboy, came, to, an, end, and, the, myths, about, the, free, living, cowboy, began, to, emerge, in, 1849, james, w, marshall, was, building, a, sawmill, for, sutter, s, fort, on, the, riverside, of, the, american, river, when, he, noticed, metal, flakes, under, the, waterwheel, he, recognized, the, flakes, to, be, gold, however, the, sawmill, he, was, building, was, not, his, meaning, that, when, he, finished, building, the, sawmill, his, client, john, sutter, would, also, notice, word, quickly, spread, of, gold, in, the, american, river, leading, to, a, surge, of, westward, migration, to, california, in, the, hope, of, striking, it, rich, this, was, the, start, of, the, california, gold, rush, the, california, gold, rush, had, positive, and, negative, benefits, for, america, it, simultaneously, increased, the, population, of, california, to, almost, 100, 000, people, which, helped, with, the, modernization, of, california, but, it, also, reduced, the, population, of, other, states, their, employment, rates, took, a, hit, as, well, as, people, were, quitting, their, jobs, so, they, could, embark, on, their, journeys, the, california, gold, rush, finally, came, to, an, end, in, 1855, the, extraction, of, gold, from, the, river, was, done, by, dust, panning, with, most, dust, panning, normally, done, by, prospectors, even, after, the, california, gold, rush, mining, was, still, a, common, occupation, most, mountainside, towns, likely, had, a, mineshaft, most, miners, were, poor, as, mining, was, a, very, labor, intensive, job, miners, would, use, pickaxes, in, order, to, mine, into, the, mountains, they, mined, gold, zinc, copper, and, other, metals, these, metals, were, sold, to, shopkeepers, and, rich, people, for, currency, miners, were, paid, a, salary, of, 1, 70, per, day, similarly, other, gold, rushes, happened, in, other, territories, as, other, expeditions, were, happening, events, such, as, the, black, hills, gold, rush, in, the, dakota, territory, following, the, black, hills, expedition, or, the, pike, s, peak, gold, rush, in, the, nebraska, territory, laws, were, less, restrictive, in, the, west, for, white, women, western, states, allowed, women, to, vote, long, before, the, eastern, states, did, and, had, more, liberal, divorce, laws, minority, women, did, not, experience, the, same, freedoms, native, women, were, forced, onto, reservations, but, still, tried, to, maintain, their, ways, of, life, and, support, their, families, chinese, women, immigrated, to, work, in, the, laundries, inns, and, saloons, of, mining, camps, some, were, sold, to, work, in, mining, camps, by, their, impoverished, families, in, china, some, women, were, also, forced, to, work, in, the, sex, industry, the, main, occupation, of, women, was, running, the, household, and, raising, children, tasks, included, cooking, cleaning, making, clothes, gardening, and, helping, out, on, the, farm, sometimes, women, were, the, sole, operators, of, farms, women, were, also, entrepreneurs, running, saloons, boarding, houses, laundries, and, inns, independent, women, earned, a, living, through, teaching, or, sex, work, in, towns, with, male, dominated, industries, such, as, logging, and, mining, the, gender, imbalance, led, to, different, roles, for, women, women, were, paid, for, domestic, work, that, was, traditionally, unpaid, some, women, also, worked, in, predominantly, male, positions, there, were, cowgirls, female, business, owners, female, gunslingers, and, female, bounty, hunters, women, had, less, lawful, protection, compared, to, men, being, a, lumberjack, was, a, labor, intensive, occupation, the, job, was, a, fairly, common, occupation, to, have, in, this, era, similarly, to, miners, and, railroad, workers, many, people, pursued, these, careers, but, was, ultimately, very, dangerous, loggers, were, paid, more, than, both, miners, and, railroaders, combined, making, 3, 20, every, day, to, cut, down, trees, lumberjacks, had, many, tools, to, help, them, in, the, process, to, cut, down, trees, they, would, send, multiple, loggers, depending, on, the, size, of, the, tree, from, there, they, would, use, double, sided, axes, to, chop, the, base, of, the, tree, after, the, tree, collapsed, if, the, tree, was, too, big, to, chop, with, the, double, sided, axes, they, would, use, a, gigantic, saw, called, a, crosscut, these, saws, could, be, over, 12, feet, in, length, and, for, transportation, they, would, either, float, the, logs, down, a, river, a, profession, known, as, log, driving, or, use, a, high, wheel, loader, to, lift, the, massive, logs, that, were, strapped, together, using, rope, another, rope, was, tied, to, oxen, then, the, oxen, would, pull, the, logs, to, wherever, they, needed, to, be, the, frontiersmen, were, the, explorers, of, the, old, west, in, 1803, thomas, jefferson, closed, the, deal, of, the, louisiana, purchase, for, 15, million, dollars, with, the, 828, 000, square, miles, of, gained, territory, he, sent, meriwether, lewis, and, william, clark, along, with, 45, other, men, to, go, explore, the, new, territory, their, expedition, across, the, western, united, states, turned, into, the, famous, lewis, and, clark, expedition, there, were, many, dangers, on, the, trail, they, had, to, travel, up,

films, about, the, american, frontier, the, image, of, a, wild, west, filled, with, countless, gunfights, was, a, myth, based, on, repeated, exaggerations, actual, gunfights, in, the, old, west, were, more, episodic, rather, than, being, a, common, thing, but, when, gunfights, did, occur, the, cause, for, each, varied, some, were, simply, the, result, of, the, heat, of, the, moment, while, others, were, longstanding, feuds, or, between, bandits, and, lawmen, although, mostly, romanticized, there, were, instances, of, quick, draw, that, did, occur, though, rarely, such, as, wild, bill, hickok,

roper, will, rogers, 1879, 1935, the, leading, humorist, of, the, 1920s, roosevelt, had, conceptualized, the, herder, cowboy, as, a, stage, of, civilization, distinct, from, the, sedentary, farmer, a, theme, well, expressed, in, the, 1944, hollywood, hit, oklahoma, that, highlights, the, enduring, conflict, between, cowboys, and, farmers, roosevelt, argued, that, the, manhood, typified, by, the,

over, time, the, cowboys, developed, a, personal, culture, of, their, own, a, blend, of, values, that, even, retained, vestiges, of, chivalry, such, hazardous, work, in, isolated, conditions, also, bred, a, tradition, of, self, dependence, and, individualism, with, great, value, put, on, personal, honesty, exemplified, in, songs, and, cowboy, poetry, the, code, also, included, the, gunfighter, who, sometimes, followed, a, form, of, code, duello, adopted, from, the, old, south, in, order, to, solve, disputes, and, duels, extrajudicial, justice, seen, during, the, frontier, days, such, as,

many, of, the, myths, of, the, frontier, but, they, nevertheless, live, on, in, community, traditions, folklore, and, fiction, in, the, 1970s, a, historiographical, range, war, broke, out, between, the, traditional, frontier, studies, which, stress, the, influence, of, the, frontier, on, all, of, american, history, and, culture, and, the, new, western, history, which, narrows, the, geographical, and, temporal, framework, to, concentrate, on, the, trans, mississippi, west, after, 1850, it, avoids, the, word, frontier, and, stresses, cultural, interaction, between, white, culture, and, groups, such, as, natives, and, hispanics, history, professor, william, weeks, of, the, university, of, san, diego, argues, that, in, this, new, western, history, approach, it, is, easy, to, tell, who, the, bad, guys, are, they, are, almost, invariably, white, male, and, middle, class, or, better, while, the, good, guys, are, almost, invariably, non, white, non, male, or, non, middle, class, anglo, american, civilization, is, represented, as, patriarchal, racist, genocidal, and, destructive, of, the, environment, in, addition, to, hypocritically, betraying, the, ideals, on, which, it, supposedly, is, built, by, 2005, steven, aron, argues, that, the, two, sides, had, reached, an, equilibrium, in, their, rhetorical, arguments, and, critiques, since, then, however, the, field, of, american, frontier, and, western, regional, history, has, become, increasingly, inclusive, the, field, s, more, recent, focus, was, captured, in, the, language, of, the, 2024, call, for, papers, of,

large, part, from, the, frontier, historiography, hence, its, emphasis, on, wilderness, it, plays, an, increasingly, large, role, in, frontier, studies, historians, approached, the, environment, for, the, frontier, or, regionalism, the, first, group, emphasizes, human, agency, on, the, environment, the, second, looks, at, the, influence, of, the, environment, william, cronon, has, argued, that, turner, s, famous, 1893, essay, was, environmental, history, in, an, embryonic, form, it, emphasized, the, vast, power, of, free, land, to, attract, and, reshape, settlers, making, a, transition, from, wilderness, to, civilization, journalist, samuel, lubell, saw, similarities, between, the, frontier, s, americanization, of, immigrants, that, turner, described, and, the, social, climbing, by, later, immigrants, in, large, cities, as, they, moved, to, wealthier, neighborhoods, he, compared, the, effects, of, the, railroad, opening, up, western, lands, to, urban, transportation, systems,
