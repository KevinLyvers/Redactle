tokhara, yabghus, turk, shahis, the, khazars, x, z, r, z, were, a, nomadic, turkic, people, that, in, the, late, 6th, century, ce, established, a, major, commercial, empire, covering, the, southeastern, section, of, modern, european, russia, southern, ukraine, crimea, and, kazakhstan, they, created, what, for, its, duration, was, the, most, powerful, polity, to, emerge, from, the, break, up, of, the, western, turkic, khaganate, astride, a, major, artery, of, commerce, between, eastern, europe, and, southwestern, asia, khazaria, became, one, of, the, foremost, trading, empires, of, the, early, medieval, world, commanding, the, western, marches, of, the, silk, road, and, playing, a, key, commercial, role, as, a, crossroad, between, china, the, middle, east, and, kievan, rus, for, some, three, centuries, c, 650, 965, the, khazars, dominated, the, vast, area, extending, from, the, volga, don, steppes, to, the, eastern, crimea, and, the, northern, caucasus, khazaria, long, served, as, a, buffer, state, between, the, byzantine, empire, and, both, the, nomads, of, the, northern, steppes, and, the, umayyad, caliphate, and, abbasid, caliphate, after, serving, as, the, byzantine, empire, s, proxy, against, the, sasanian, empire, the, alliance, was, dropped, around, 900, byzantium, began, to, encourage, the, alans, to, attack, khazaria, and, to, weaken, its, hold, on, crimea, and, the, caucasus, and, sought, to, obtain, an, entente, with, the, rising, rus, power, to, the, north, which, it, aspired, to, convert, to, christianity, between, 965, and, 969, the, kievan, rus, ruler, sviatoslav, i, of, kiev, as, well, as, his, allies, conquered, the, capital, atil, and, ended, khazaria, s, independence, the, state, became, the, autonomous, entity, of, rus, and, then, of, khazar, former, provinces, of, khwarazm, in, which, khazars, were, known, as, turks, just, as, hungarians, were, known, as, turks, in, byzantium, in, volga, bulgaria, determining, the, origins, and, nature, of, the, khazars, is, closely, bound, with, theories, of, their, languages, but, it, is, a, matter, of, intricate, difficulty, since, no, indigenous, records, in, the, khazar, language, survived, and, the, state, was, polyglot, and, polyethnic, the, native, religion, of, the, khazars, is, thought, to, have, been, tengrism, like, that, of, the, north, caucasian, huns, and, other, turkic, peoples, the, polyethnic, populace, of, the, khazar, khaganate, appears, to, have, been, a, multiconfessional, mosaic, of, pagan, tengrist, jewish, christian, and, muslim, worshippers, some, of, the, khazars, namely, the, kabars, joined, the, ancient, hungarians, in, the, 9th, century, the, ruling, elite, of, the, khazars, was, said, by, judah, halevi, and, abraham, ibn, daud, to, have, converted, to, rabbinic, judaism, in, the, 8th, century, but, the, scope, of, the, conversion, to, judaism, within, the, khazar, khanate, remains, uncertain, where, the, khazars, dispersed, after, the, fall, of, the, empire, is, subject, to, many, conjectures, proposals, have, been, made, regarding, the, possibility, of, a, khazar, factor, in, the, ethnogenesis, of, numerous, peoples, such, as, the, hazaras, hungarians, the, kazakhs, the, cossacks, of, the, don, region, and, of, ukraine, the, muslim, kumyks, the, turkic, speaking, krymchaks, and, their, crimean, neighbours, the, crimean, karaites, the, moldavian, cs, ng, s, the, mountain, jews, even, some, subbotniks, on, the, basis, of, their, ukrainian, and, cossack, origin, and, others, the, late, 19th, century, saw, the, emergence, of, the, theory, that, the, core, of, today, s, ashkenazi, jews, are, descended, from, a, hypothetical, khazarian, jewish, diaspora, which, migrated, westward, from, modern, day, russia, and, ukraine, into, modern, day, france, and, germany, linguistic, and, genetic, studies, have, not, supported, the, theory, of, a, khazar, connection, to, ashkenazi, jewry, the, theory, still, finds, occasional, support, but, most, scholars, view, it, with, considerable, scepticism, the, theory, is, sometimes, associated, with, antisemitism, and, anti, zionism, in, oghuz, turkic, languages, the, caspian, sea, is, still, named, the, khazar, sea, an, enduring, legacy, of, the, medieval, khazar, state, gyula, n, meth, following, zolt, n, gombocz, derived, khazar, from, a, hypothetical, qasar, reflecting, a, turkic, root, qaz, to, ramble, to, roam, being, an, hypothetical, retracted, variant, of, common, turkic, kez, however, andr, s, r, na, tas, objected, that, qaz, is, a, ghost, word, in, the, fragmentary, tes, and, terkhin, inscriptions, of, the, uy, ur, empire, 744, 840, the, form, qasar, is, attested, although, uncertainty, remains, whether, this, represents, a, personal, or, tribal, name, gradually, other, hypotheses, emerged, louis, bazin, derived, it, from, turkic, qas, tyrannize, oppress, terrorize, on, the, basis, of, its, phonetic, similarity, to, the, uy, ur, tribal, name, qasar, r, na, tas, connects, qasar, with, kesar, the, pahlavi, transcription, of, the, roman, title, caesar, d, m, dunlop, tried, to, link, the, chinese, term, for, khazars, to, one, of, the, tribal, names, of, the, uy, ur, or, toquz, o, uz, namely, the, qasar, ch, g, s, the, objections, are, that, uy, ur, g, s, qasar, was, not, a, tribal, name, but, rather, the, surname, of, the, chief, of, the, sijie, tribe, sogdian, sikari, of, the, toquz, o, uz, ch, j, u, x, ng, and, that, in, middle, chinese, the, ethnonym, khazars, was, always, prefaced, with, t, ju, then, still,

render, the, syllable, qa, in, the, uy, ur, word, qasar, while, it, is, far, from, given, that, the, khazars, are, not, signifying, a, multi, ethnic, and, multi, lingual, cluster, of, peoples, and, clans, some, more, nomadic, some, less, it, doesn, t, exclude, that, some, clans, or, splintergroups, or, even, rulers, has, identified, with, the, name, s, of, the, khazars, in, the, variety, of, ways, it, has, been, expressed, after, their, conversion, it, is, reported, that, they, adopted, the, hebrew, script, and, it, is, likely, that, although, speaking, a, turkic, language, the, khazar, chancellery, under, judaism, probably, corresponded, in, hebrew, determining, the, origins, and, nature, of, the, khazars, is, closely, bound, with, theories, of, their, languages, but, it, is, a, matter, of, intricate, difficulty, since, no, indigenous, records, in, the, khazar, language, survive, and, the, state, was, polyglot, and, polyethnic, whereas, the, royal, or, ruling, elite, probably, spoke, an, eastern, variety, of, shaz, turkic, the, subject, tribes, appear, to, have, spoken, varieties, of, lir, turkic, such, as, o, uric, a, language, variously, identified, with, bul, aric, chuvash, and, hunnish, the, latter, based, upon, the, assertion, of, the, persian, historian, istakhri, the, khazar, language, was, different, from, any, other, known, tongue, alano, as, was, also, widely, spoken, eastern, common, turkic, the, language, of, the, royal, house, and, its, core, tribes, in, all, likelihood, remained, the, language, of, the, ruling, elite, in, the, same, way, that, mongol, continued, to, be, used, by, the, rulers, of, the, golden, horde, alongside, of, the, qip, aq, turkic, speech, spoken, by, the, bulk, of, the, turkic, tribesmen, that, constituted, the,

for, tracing, their, origins, consists, in, the, analysis, of, the, possible, etymologies, behind, the, ethnonym, khazar, the, tribes, that, were, to, comprise, the, khazar, empire, were, not, an, ethnic, union, but, a, congeries, of, steppe, nomads, and, peoples, who, came, to, be, subordinated, and, subscribed, to, a, core, turkic, leadership, many, turkic, groups, such, as, the, o, uric, peoples, including, ara, urs, o, urs, ono, urs, and, bul, ars, who, earlier, formed, part, of, the, tiele, ti, l, confederation, are, attested, quite, early, having, been, driven, west, by, the, sabirs, who, in, turn, fled, the, asian, avars, and, began, to, flow, into, the, volga, caspian, pontic, zone, from, as, early, as, the, 4th, century, ce, and, are, recorded, by, priscus, to, reside, in, the, western, eurasian, steppe, lands, as, early, as, 463, they, appear, to, stem, from, mongolia, and, south, siberia, in, the, aftermath, of, the, fall, of, the, hunnic, xi, ngn, nomadic, polities, a, variegated, tribal, federation, led, by, these, turks, probably, comprising, a, complex, assortment, of, iranian, proto, mongolic, uralic, and, palaeo, siberian, clans, vanquished, the, rouran, khaganate, of, the, hegemonic, central, asian, avars, in, 552, and, swept, westwards, taking, in, their, train, other, steppe, nomads, and, peoples, from, sogdiana, the, ruling, family, of, this, confederation, may, have, hailed, from, the, sh, n, clan, of, the, western, turkic, khaganate, although, constantine, zuckerman, regards, ashina, and, their, pivotal, role, in, the, formation, of, the, khazars, with, scepticism, golden, notes, that, chinese, and, arabic, reports, are, almost, identical, making, the, connection, a, strong, one, and, conjectures, that, their, leader, may, have, been, y, p, sh, ku, who, lost, power, or, was, killed, around, 651, moving, west, the, confederation, reached, the, land, of, the, akatziroi, who, had, been, important, allies, of, byzantium, in, fighting, off, attila, s, army, an, embryonic, state, of, khazaria, began, to, form, sometime, after, 630, when, it, emerged, from, the, breakdown, of, the, larger, g, kt, rk, khaganate, g, kt, rk, armies, had, penetrated, the, volga, by, 549, ejecting, the, avars, who, were, then, forced, to, flee, to, the, sanctuary, of, the, hungarian, plain, the, ashina, clan, appeared, on, the, scene, by, 552, when, they, overthrew, the, rourans, and, established, the, g, kt, rk, qa, anate, whose, self, designation, was, t, r, k, by, 568, these, g, kt, rks, were, probing, for, an, alliance, with, byzantium, to, attack, persia, an, internecine, war, broke, out, between, the, senior, eastern, g, kt, rks, and, the, junior, west, turkic, khaganate, some, decades, later, when, on, the, death, of, taspar, qa, an, a, succession, dispute, led, to, a, dynastic, crisis, between, taspar, s, chosen, heir, the, apa, qa, an, and, the, ruler, appointed, by, the, tribal, high, council, sh, n, sh, t, the, ishbara, qa, an, by, the, first, decades, of, the, 7th, century, the, ashina, yabgu, tong, managed, to, stabilise, the, western, division, but, upon, his, death, after, providing, crucial, military, assistance, to, byzantium, in, routing, the, sasanian, army, in, the, persian, heartland, the, western, turkic, qa, anate, dissolved, under, pressure, from, the, encroaching, tang, dynasty, armies, and, split, into, two, competing, federations, each, consisting, of, five, tribes, collectively, known, as, the, ten, arrows, on, oq, both, briefly, challenged, tang, hegemony, in, eastern, turkestan, to, the, west, two, new, nomadic, states, arose, in, the, meantime, old, great, bulgaria, under, kubrat, the, du, l, clan, leader, and, the, n, sh, b, subconfederation, also, consisting, of, five, tribes, the, du, l, challenged, the, avars, in, the, kuban, river, sea, of, azov, area, while, the, khazar, qa, anate, consolidated, further, westwards, led, apparently, by, an, ashina, dynasty, with, a, resounding, victory, over, the, tribes, in, 657, engineered, by, general, s, d, ngf, ng, chinese, overlordship, was, imposed, to, their, east, after, a, final, mop, up, operation, in, 659, but, the, two, confederations, of, bul, ars, and, khazars, fought, for, supremacy, on, the, western, steppeland, and, with, the, ascendency, of, the, latter, the, former, either, succumbed, to, khazar, rule, or, as, under, asparukh, kubrat, s, son, shifted, even, further, west, across, the, danube, to, lay, the, foundations, of, the, first, bulgarian, empire, in, the, balkans, c, 679, the, qa, anate, of, the, khazars, thus, took, shape, out, of, the, ruins, of, this, nomadic, empire, as, it, broke, up, under, pressure, from, the, tang, dynasty, armies, to, the, east, sometime, between, 630, and, 650, after, their, conquest, of, the, lower, volga, region, to, the, east, and, an, area, westwards, between, the, danube, and, the, dniepr, and, their, subjugation, of, the, ono, ur, bul, ar, union, sometime, around, 670, a, properly, constituted, khazar, qa, anate, emerges, becoming, the, westernmost, successor, state, of, the, formidable, g, kt, rk, qa, anate, after, its, disintegration, according, to, omeljan, pritsak, the, language, of, the, ono, ur, bul, ar, federation, was, to, become, the, lingua, franca, of, khazaria, as, it, developed, into, what, lev, gumilev, called, a, steppe, atlantis, stepnaja, atlantida, historians, have, often, referred, to, this, period, of, khazar, domination, as, the, pax, khazarica, since, the, state, became, an, international, trading, hub, permitting, western, eurasian, merchants, safe, transit, across, it, to, pursue, their, business, without, interference, the, high, status, soon, to, be, accorded, this, empire, to, the, north, is, attested, by, ibn, al, bal, s, f, rsn, ma, c, 1100, which, relates, that, the, sasanian, shah, usraw, 1, an, s, rv, n, placed, three, thrones, by, his, own, one, for, the, king, of, china, a, second, for, the, king, of, byzantium, and, a, third, for, the, king, of, the, khazars, although, anachronistic, in, retrodating, the, khazars, to, this, period, the, legend, in, placing, the, khazar, qa, an, on, a, throne, with, equal, status, to, kings, of, the, other, two, superpowers, bears, witness, to, the, reputation, won, by, the, khazars, from, early, times, khazaria, developed, a, dual, kingship, governance, structure, typical, among, turkic, nomads, consisting, of, a, shad, b, k, and, a, qa, an, the, emergence, of, this, system, may, be, deeply, entwined, with, the, conversion, to, judaism, according, to, arabic, sources, the, lesser, king, was, called, and, the, greater, king, khazar, x, q, n, the, former, managed, and, commanded, the, military, while, the, greater, king, s, role, was, primarily, sacral, less, concerned, with, daily, affairs, the, greater, king, was, recruited, from, the, khazar, house, of, notables, ahl, bait, ma, r, f, n, and, in, an, initiation, ritual, was, nearly, strangled, until, he, declared, the, number, of, years, he, wished, to, reign, on, the, expiration, of, which, he, would, be, killed, by, the, nobles, the, deputy, ruler, would, enter, the, presence, of, the, reclusive, greater, king, only, with, great, ceremony, approaching, him, barefoot, to, prostrate, himself, in, the, dust, and, then, light, a, piece, of, wood, as, a, purifying, fire, while, waiting, humbly, and, calmly, to, be, summoned, particularly, elaborate, rituals, accompanied, a, royal, burial, at, one, period, travellers, had, to, dismount, bow, before, the, ruler, s, tomb, and, then, walk, away, on, foot, subsequently, the, charismatic, sovereign, s, burial, place, was, hidden, from, view, with, a, palatial, structure, paradise, constructed, and, then, hidden, under, rerouted, river, water, to, avoid, disturbance, by, evil, spirits, and, later, generations, such, a, royal, burial, ground, qoruq, is, typical, of, inner, asian, peoples, both, the, and, the, x, q, n, converted, to, judaism, sometime, in, the, 8th, century, while, the, rest, according, to, the, persian, traveller, ahmad, ibn, rustah, probably, followed, the, old, t, rkic, religion, the, ruling, stratum, like, that, of, the, later, inggisids, within, the, golden, horde, was, a, relatively, small, group, that, differed, ethnically, and, linguistically, from, its, subject, peoples, meaning, the, alano, as, and, o, uric, turkic, tribes, who, were, numerically, superior, within, khazaria, the, khazar, qa, ans, while, taking, wives, and, concubines, from, the, subject, populations, were, protected, by, a, khw, razmian, guard, corps, or, comitatus, called, the, ursiyya, but, unlike, many, other, local, polities, they, hired, soldiers, mercenaries, the, jun, d, murtaz, qa, in, al, mas, d, at, the, peak, of, their, empire, the, khazars, ran, a, centralised, fiscal, administration, with, a, standing, army, of, some, 7, 12, 000, men, which, could, at, need, be, multiplied, two, or, three, times, that, number, by, inducting, reserves, from, their, nobles, retinues, other, figures, for, the, permanent, standing, army, indicate, that, it, numbered, as, many, as, one, hundred, thousand, they, controlled, and, exacted, tribute, from, 25, to, 30, different, nations, and, tribes, inhabiting, the, vast, territories, between, the, caucasus, the, aral, sea, the, ural, mountains, and, the, ukrainian, steppes, khazar, armies, were, led, by, the, qa, an, bek, pronounced, as, kagan, bek, and, commanded, by, subordinate, officers, known, as, tarkhans, when, the, bek, sent, out, a, body, of, troops, they, would, not, retreat, under, any, circumstances, if, they, were, defeated, every, one, who, returned, was, killed, settlements, were, governed, by, administrative, officials, known, as, tuduns, in, some, cases, such, as, the, byzantine, settlements, in, southern, crimea, a, tudun, would, be, appointed, for, a, town, nominally, within, another, polity, s, sphere, of, influence, other, officials, in, the, khazar, government, included, dignitaries, referred, to, by, ibn, fadlan, as, jawyshyghr, and, k, nd, r, but, their, responsibilities, are, unknown, it, has, been, estimated, that, 25, to, 28, distinct, ethnic, groups, made, up, the, population, of, the, khazar, qa, anate, aside, from, the, ethnic, elite, the, ruling, elite, seems, to, have, been, constituted, out, of, nine, tribes, clans, themselves, ethnically, heterogeneous, spread, over, perhaps, nine, provinces, or, principalities, each, of, which, would, have, been, allocated, to, a, clan, in, terms, of, caste, or, class, some, evidence, suggests, that, there, was, a, distinction, whether, racial, or, social, is, unclear, between, white, khazars, ak, khazars, and, black, khazars, qara, khazars, the, 10th, century, muslim, geographer, al, i, akhr, claimed, that, the, white, khazars, were, strikingly, handsome, with, reddish, hair, white, skin, and, blue, eyes, while, the, black, khazars, were, swarthy, verging, on, deep, black, as, if, they, were, some, kind, of, indian, many, turkic, nations, had, a, similar, political, not, racial, division, between, a, white, ruling, warrior, caste, and, a, black, class, of, commoners, the, consensus, among, mainstream, scholars, is, that, istakhri, was, confused, by, the, names, given, to, the, two, groups, however, khazars, are, generally, described, by, early, arab, sources, as, having, a, white, complexion, blue, eyes, and, reddish, hair, the, ethnonym, in, the, tang, chinese, annals, ashina, often, accorded, a, key, role, in, the, khazar, leadership, may, reflect, an, eastern, iranian, or, tokharian, word, khotanese, saka, eina, sena, blue, middle, persian, ax, a, na, dark, coloured, tokharian, a, na,

of, hungary, refer, to, them, as, white, oghurs, and, magyars, as, black, oghurs, studies, of, the, physical, remains, such, as, skulls, at, sarkel, have, revealed, individuals, belonging, to, the, slavic, other, european, and, a, few, mongolian, types, the, import, and, export, of, foreign, wares, and, the, revenues, derived, from, taxing, their, transit, was, a, hallmark, of, the, khazar,

influence, the, affairs, of, transcaucasia, the, qa, an, was, forced, to, accept, terms, involving, his, conversion, to, islam, and, subject, himself, to, the, rule, of, the, caliphate, but, the, accommodation, was, short, lived, because, a, combination, of, internal, instability, among, the, umayyads, and, byzantine, support, undid, the, agreement, within, three, years, and, the, khazars, re, asserted, their, independence, the, suggestion, that, the, khazars, adopted, judaism, as, early, as, 740, is, based, on, the, idea, that, in, part, it, was, a, re, assertion, of, their, independence, from, the, rule, of, both, regional, powers, byzantium, and, the, caliphate, while, it, also, conformed, to, a, general, eurasian, trend, to, embrace, a, world, religion, whatever, the, impact, of,

the, region, was, limited, because, maintaining, a, large, garrison, at, derbent, further, depleted, their, already, overstretched, army, a, third, muslim, civil, war, soon, broke, out, leading, to, the, abbasid, revolution, and, the, fall, of, the, umayyad, dynasty, in, 750, in, 758, the, abbasid, caliph, al, mansur, attempted, to, strengthen, diplomatic, ties, with, the, khazars, ordering,

died, inexplicably, possibly, during, childbirth, her, attendants, returned, home, convinced, that, some, members, of, another, arab, faction, had, poisoned, her, and, her, father, was, enraged, the, khazar, general, ras, tarkhan, invaded, regions, which, were, located, south, of, the, caucasus, in, 762, 764, devastating, albania, armenia, and, iberia, and, capturing, tiflis, thereafter, relations, between, the, khazars, and, the, abbasids, became, increasingly, cordial, because, the, foreign, policies, of, the, abbasids, were, generally, less, expansionist, than, the, foreign, policies, of, the, umayyads, relations, between, the, khazars, and, the, abbasids, were, ultimately, broken, by, a, series, of, raids, which, occurred, in, 799, the, raids, occurred, after, another, marriage, alliance, failed, around, 830, a, rebellion, broke, out, in, the, khazar, khaganate, as, a, result, three, kabar, tribes, of, the, khazars, probably, the, majority, of, ethnic, khazars, joined, the, hungarians, and, moved, through, levedia, to, what, the, hungarians, call, the, etelk, z, the, territory, between, the, carpathians, and, the, dnieper, river, the, hungarians, faced, their, first, attack, by, the, pechenegs, around, 854, though, other, sources, state, that, an, attack, by, pechenegs, was, the, reason, for, their, departure, to, etelk, z, the, new, neighbours, of, the, hungarians, were, the, varangians, and, the, eastern, slavs, from, 862, onwards, the, hungarians, already, referred, to, as, the, ungri, along, with, their, allies, the, kabars, started, a, series, of, raids, from, the, etelk, z, into, the, carpathian, basin, mostly, against, the, eastern, frankish, empire, germany, and, great, moravia, but, also, against, the, lower, pannonian, principality, and, bulgaria, then, they, together, ended, up, at, the, outer, slopes, of, carpathians, and, settled, there, by, the, 9th, century, groups, of, varangian, rus, developing, a, powerful,

as, they, were, at, byzantine, cherson, their, presence, may, have, prompted, the, formation, of, a, rus, state, by, convincing, the, slavs, merja, and, the, chud, to, unite, to, protect, common, interests, against, khazarian, exactions, of, tribute, it, is, often, argued, that, a, rus, khaganate, modelled, on, the, khazarian, state, had, formed, to, the, east, and, that, the, varangian, chieftain, of, the, coalition, appropriated, the, title, of, qa, an, khagan, as, early, as, the, 830s, the, title, survived, to, denote, the, princes, of, kievan, rus, whose, capital, kiev, is, often,

of, an, autonomous, khazar, coinage, around, the, 830s, may, have, been, a, defensive, measure, against, emerging, threats, from, varangians, to, the, north, and, from, the, magyars, on, the, eastern,

to, accept, either, islam, or, orthodoxy, the, conversion, of, the, khazars, to, judaism, is, an, emotionally, charged, topic, in, israel, and, two, scholars, moshe, gil, 2011, and, shaul, stampfer,

arabic, text, that, refers, to, khazar, jewishness, appears, to, be, that, which, was, written, by, ibn, rustah, a, persian, scholar, who, wrote, an, encyclopedic, work, on, geography, in, the, early, tenth, century, it, is, believed, that, ibn, rustah, derived, much, of, his, information, from, the, works, of, his, contemporary, abu, al, jayhani, based, in, central, asia, christian, of, stavelot,

the, 837, 8, evidence, marks, only, the, beginning, of, a, long, and, difficult, official, judaization, that, concluded, some, decades, later, a, 9th, century, jewish, traveller, eldad, ha, dani, is, said, to, have, informed, spanish, jews, in, 883, that, there, was, a, jewish, polity, in, the, east, and, that, fragments, of, the, legendary, ten, lost, tribes, part, of, the, line, of, simeon, and, half, line, of, manasseh, dwelt, in, the, land, of, the, khazars, receiving, tribute, from, some, 25, to, 28, kingdoms, another, view, holds, that, by, the, 10th, century, while, the, royal, clan, officially, claimed, judaism, a, non, normative, variety, of, islamisation, took, place, among, the, majority, of, khazars, by, the, 10th, century, the, letter, of, king, joseph, asserts, that, after,

element, of, the, state, the, khazars, were, judaized, something, underwritten, by, the, qaraite, scholar, ya, kub, qirqis, n, around, 937, the, conversion, appears, to, have, occurred, against, a, background, of, frictions, arising, from, both, an, intensification, of, byzantine, missionary, activity, from, the, crimea, to, the, caucasus, and, arab, attempts, to, wrest, control, over, the, latter, in, the, 8th, century, ce, and, a, revolt, put, down, by, the, khavars, around, the, mid, 9th, century, is, often, invoked, as, in, part, influenced, by, their, refusal, to, accept, judaism, modern, scholars, generally, see, the, conversion, as, a, slow, process, through, three, stages, which, accords, with, richard, eaton, s, model, of, syncretic, inclusion, gradual, identification, and, finally, displacement, of, the, older, tradition, sometime, between, 954, and, 961, asdai, ibn, shapr, from, al, andalus, muslim, spain, wrote, a, letter, of, inquiry, addressed, to, the, ruler, of,

interests, in, khazaria, in, the, wake, of, islamic, and, byzantine, persecutions, of, jews, abroad, ibn, fadlan, recounts, specifically, an, incident, in, which, the, king, of, khazaria, destroyed, the, minaret, of, a, mosque, in, atil, as, revenge, for, the, destruction, of, a, synagogue, in, d, r, al, b, b, naj, and, allegedly, said, he, would, have, done, worse, were, it, not, for, a, fear,

educational, efforts, of, the, great, sephardi, scholar, chaim, hezekiah, medini, came, to, conform, with, traditional, judaism, though, the, assertion, they, were, not, of, jewish, stock, enabled, many, crimean, karaites, to, survive, the, holocaust, which, led, to, the, murder, of, 6, 000, krymchaks, after, the, war, many, of, the, latter, somewhat, indifferent, to, their, jewish, heritage, took, a, cue, from, the, crimean, karaites, and, denied, this, connection, in, order, to, avoid, the, antisemitic, effects, of, the, stigma, attached, to, jews, several, scholars, have, suggested, that, instead, of, disappearing, after, the, dissolution, of, their, empire, the, khazars, migrated, westward, and, eventually, they, formed, part, of, the, core, of, the, later, ashkenazi, jewish, population, of, europe, this, hypothesis, is, greeted, with, scepticism, or, caution, by, most, scholars, the, german, orientalist, karl, neumann, in, the, context, of, an, earlier, controversy, about, possible, connections, between, the, khazars, and, the, ancestors, of, the, slavic, peoples, suggested, as, early, as, 1847, that, emigrant, khazars, might, have, influenced, the, core, population, of, eastern, european, jews, the, theory, was, then, taken, up, by, albert, harkavi, in, 1869, when, he, also, claimed, that, a, possible, link, existed, between, the, khazars, and, the, ashkenazim, but, the, theory, that, khazar, converts, formed, a, major, proportion, of, the, ashkenazim, was, first, proposed, to, the, western, public, in, a, lecture, which, was, delivered, by, ernest, renan, in, 1883, occasional, suggestions, that, there, was, a, small, khazar, component, in, east, european, jews, emerged, in, works, by, joseph, jacobs, 1886, anatole, leroy, beaulieu, a, critic, of, antisemitism, 1893, maksymilian, ernest, gumplowicz, and, by, the, russian, jewish, anthropologist, samuel, weissenberg, in, 1909, hugo, von, kutschera, developed, the, notion, into, a, book, length, study, arguing, that, the, khazars, formed, the, foundational, core, of, the, modern, ashkenazim, maurice, fishberg, introduced, the, notion, to, american, audiences, in, 1911, the, idea, was, also, taken, up, by, the, polish, jewish, economic, historian, and, general, zionist, yitzhak, schipper, in, 1918, israel, bartal, has, suggested, that, from, the, haskalah, onwards, polemical, pamphlets, against, the, khazars, were, inspired, by, sephardi, organizations, which, opposed, the, khazaro, ashkenazim, scholarly, anthropologists, such, as, roland, b, dixon, 1923, and, writers, such, as, h, g, wells, 1920, used, it, to, argue, that, the, main, part, of, jewry, never, was, in, judea, a, thesis, that, was, to, have, a, political, echo, in, later, opinion, in, 1932, samuel, krauss, ventured, the, theory, that, the, biblical, ashkenaz, referred, to, northern, asia, minor, and, he, identified, it, as, the, ancestral, homeland, of, the, khazars, a, position, which, was, immediately, disputed, by, jacob, mann, ten, years, later, in, 1942, abraham, n, polak, sometimes, referred, to, as, poliak, later, professor, for, the, history, of, the, middle, ages, at, tel,

evidence, supported, what, he, considered, a, mere, assumption, and, he, also, argued, that, the, ashkenazi, khazar, descent, theory, went, far, beyond, what, our, imperfect, records, permit, in, 1955, l, on, poliakov, who, assumed, that, the, jews, of, western, europe, resulted, from, a, panmixia, in, the, first, millennium, asserted, that, it, was, widely, assumed, that, europe, s, eastern,

of, the, hakkari, mountains, in, southeast, turkey, the, khazar, ashkenazi, hypothesis, came, to, the, attention, of, a, much, wider, public, with, the, publication, of, arthur, koestler, s, the, thirteenth, tribe, in, 1976, which, was, both, positively, reviewed, and, dismissed, as, a, fantasy, and, a, somewhat, dangerous, one, israeli, historian, zvi, ankori, argued, that, koestler, had, allowed, his, literary, imagination, to, espouse, poliak, s, thesis, which, most, historians, dismissed, as, speculative, israel, s, ambassador, to, britain, branded, it, an, anti, semitic, action, financed, by, the, palestinians, while, bernard, lewis, claimed, that, the, idea, was, not, supported, by, any, evidence, whatsoever, and, it, had, been, abandoned, by, all, serious, scholars, raphael, patai, however, registered, some, support, for, the, idea, that, khazar, remnants, had, played, a, role, in, the, growth, of, eastern, european, jewish, communities, and, several, amateur, researchers, such, as, boris, altsch, ler, 1994, kept, the, thesis, in, the, public, eye, the, theory, has, been, occasionally, manipulated, to, deny, jewish, nationhood, recently, a, variety, of, approaches, from, linguistics, paul, wexler, to, historiography, shlomo, sand, and, population, genetics, eran, elhaik, a, geneticist, from, the, university, of, sheffield, have, emerged, to, keep, the, theory, alive, in, a, broad, academic, perspective, both, the, idea, that, the, khazars, converted, en, masse, to, judaism, and, the, suggestion, they, emigrated, to, form, the, core, population, of, ashkenazi, jewry, remain, highly, polemical, issues, one, thesis, held, that, the, khazar, jewish, population, went, into, a, northern, diaspora, and, had, a, significant, impact, on, the, rise, of, ashkenazi, jews, connected, to, this, thesis, is, the, theory, expounded, by, paul, wexler, dissenting, from, the, majority, of, yiddish, linguists, that, the, grammar, of, yiddish, contains, a, khazar, substrate, according, to, michael, barkun, while, the, khazar, hypothesis, generally, never, played, any, major, role, in, the, development, of, anti, semitism, it, has, exercised, a, noticeable, influence, on, american, antisemites, since, the, restrictions, on, immigration, were, imposed, in, the, 1920s, maurice, fishberg, and, roland, b, dixon, s, works, were, later, exploited, in, racist, and, religious, polemical, literature, particularly, in, literature, which, advocated, british, israelism, both, in, britain, and, the, united, states, particularly, after, the, publication, of, burton, j, hendrick, s, the, jews, in, america, 1923, it, began, to, enjoy, a, vogue, among, advocates, of, immigration, restriction, in, the, 1920s, racial, theorists, such, as, lothrop, stoddard, antisemitic, conspiracy, theorists, such, as, the, ku, klux, klan, s, hiram, wesley, evans, and, some, anti, communist, polemicists, such, as, john, o, beaty, and, wilmot, robertson, whose, views, influenced, david, duke, according, to, yehoshafat, harkabi, 1968, and, others, it, played, a, role, in, arab, anti, zionist, polemics, and, took, on, an, antisemitic, edge, bernard, lewis, noting, in, 1987, that, arab, scholars, had, dropped, it, remarked, that, it, only, occasionally, emerged, in, arab, political, discourse, it, has, also, played, some, role, in, soviet, antisemitic, chauvinism, and, slavic, eurasian, historiography, particularly, in, the, works, of, scholars, like, lev, gumilev, it, came, to, be, exploited, by, the, white, supremacist, christian, identity, movement, and, even, by, terrorist, esoteric, cults, like, aum, shinriky, the, kazar, hypothesis, was, further, exploited, by, esoteric, fascists, such, as, miguel, serrano, referring, to, a, lost, palestinabuch, by, the, german, nazi, scholar, herman, wirth, who, claimed, to, have, proven, that, the, jews, descended, from, a, prehistoric, migrant, group, parasiting, on, the, great, civilizations, the, phrase, khazar, kaghanate, gained, new, traction, in, 2000s, among, antisemitic, nationalists, in, russia, such, as, yan, petrovsky, the, hypothesis, of, khazarian, ancestry, in, ashkenazi, has, also, been, a, subject, of, vehement, disagreements, in, the, field, of, population, genetics, wherein, claims, have, been, made, concerning, evidence, both, for, and, against, it, eran, elhaik, argued, in, 2012, for, a, significant, khazar, component, in, the, admixture, of, ashkenazi, jews, using, caucasian, populations, georgians, armenians, and, azerbaijani, jews, as, proxies, the, evidence, from, historians, he, used, has, been, criticised, by, shaul, stampfer, and, the, technical, response, to, such, a, position, from, geneticists, is, mostly, dismissive, arguing, that, if, traces, of, descent, from, khazars, exist, in, the, ashkenazi, gene, pool, the, contribution, would, be, quite, minor, or, insignificant, one, geneticist, raphael, falk, has, argued, that, national, and, ethnic, prejudices, play, a, central, role, in, the, controversy, according, to, nadia, abu, el, haj, the, issues, of, origins, are, generally, complicated, by, the, difficulties, of, writing, history, via, genome, studies, and, the, biases, of, emotional, investments, in, different, narratives, depending, on, whether, the, emphasis, lies, on, direct, descent, or, on, conversion, within, jewish, history, at, the, time, of, her, writing, the, lack, of, khazar, dna, samples, that, might, allow, verification, also, presented, difficulties, the, kuzari, is, an,

fictional, dialogue, between, the, pagan, king, of, the, khazars, and, a, jew, who, was, invited, to, instruct, him, in, the, tenets, of, the, jewish, religion, the, intent, of, the, work, although, based, on, asdai, ibn, shapr, s, correspondence, with, the, khazar, king, was, not, historical, but, rather, to, defend, judaism, as, a, revealed, religion, written, in, the, context, firstly, of,
