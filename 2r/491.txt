the, empire, of, brazil, was, a, 19th, century, state, that, broadly, comprised, the, territories, which, form, modern, brazil, and, uruguay, until, the, latter, achieved, independence, in, 1828, the, empire, s, government, was, a, representative, parliamentary, constitutional, monarchy, under, the, rule, of, emperors, pedro, i, and, his, son, pedro, ii, a, colony, of, the, kingdom, of, portugal, brazil, became, the, seat, of, the, portuguese, empire, in, 1808, when, the, portuguese, prince, regent, later, king, dom, john, vi, fled, from, napoleon, s, invasion, of, portugal, and, established, himself, and, his, government, in, the, brazilian, city, of, rio, de, janeiro, john, vi, later, returned, to, portugal, leaving, his, eldest, son, and, heir, apparent, pedro, to, rule, the, kingdom, of, brazil, as, regent, on, 7, september, 1822, pedro, declared, the, independence, of, brazil, and, after, waging, a, successful, war, against, his, father, s, kingdom, was, acclaimed, on, 12, october, as, pedro, i, the, first, emperor, of, brazil, the, new, country, was, huge, sparsely, populated, and, ethnically, diverse, unlike, most, of, the, neighboring, hispanic, american, republics, brazil, had, political, stability, vibrant, economic, growth, constitutionally, guaranteed, freedom, of, speech, and, respect, for, civil, rights, of, its, subjects, albeit, with, legal, restrictions, on, women, and, slaves, the, latter, regarded, as, property, and, not, citizens, the, empire, s, bicameral, parliament, was, elected, under, comparatively, democratic, methods, for, the, era, as, were, the, provincial, and, local, legislatures, this, led, to, a, long, ideological, conflict, between, pedro, i, and, a, sizable, parliamentary, faction, over, the, role, of, the, monarch, in, the, government, he, also, had, to, face, other, obstacles, the, unsuccessful, cisplatine, war, against, the, neighboring, united, provinces, of, the, r, o, de, la, plata, in, 1828, led, to, the, secession, of, the, province, of, cisplatina, later, to, become, uruguay, in, 1826, despite, his, role, in, brazilian, independence, he, became, the, king, of, portugal, he, abdicated, the, portuguese, throne, in, favor, of, his, eldest, daughter, two, years, later, she, was, usurped, by, pedro, i, s, younger, brother, miguel, unable, to, deal, with, both, brazilian, and, portuguese, affairs, pedro, i, abdicated, his, brazilian, throne, on, 7, april, 1831, and, immediately, departed, for, europe, to, restore, his, daughter, to, the, portuguese, throne, pedro, i, s, successor, in, brazil, was, his, five, year, old, son, pedro, ii, as, the, latter, was, still, a, minor, a, weak, regency, was, created, the, power, vacuum, resulting, from, the, absence, of, a, ruling, monarch, as, the, ultimate, arbiter, in, political, disputes, led, to, regional, civil, wars, between, local, factions, having, inherited, an, empire, on, the, verge, of, disintegration, pedro, ii, once, he, was, legally, declared, of, age, managed, to, bring, peace, and, stability, to, the, country, which, eventually, became, an, emerging, international, power, brazil, was, victorious, in, three, international, conflicts, the, platine, war, the, uruguayan, war, and, the, paraguayan, war, under, pedro, ii, s, rule, and, the, empire, prevailed, in, several, other, international, disputes, and, outbreaks, of, domestic, strife, with, prosperity, and, economic, development, came, an, influx, of, european, immigration, including, protestants, and, jews, although, brazil, remained, mostly, catholic, slavery, which, had, initially, been, widespread, was, restricted, by, successive, legislation, until, its, final, abolition, in, 1888, brazilian, visual, arts, literature, and, theater, developed, during, this, time, of, progress, although, heavily, influenced, by, european, styles, that, ranged, from, neoclassicism, to, romanticism, each, concept, was, adapted, to, create, a, culture, that, was, uniquely, brazilian, even, though, the, last, four, decades, of, pedro, ii, s, reign, were, marked, by, continuous, internal, peace, and, economic, prosperity, he, had, no, desire, to, see, the, monarchy, survive, beyond, his, lifetime, and, made, no, effort, to, maintain, support, for, the, institution, the, next, in, line, to, the, throne, was, his, daughter, isabel, but, neither, pedro, ii, nor, the, ruling, classes, considered, a, female, monarch, acceptable, lacking, any, viable, heir, the, empire, s, political, leaders, saw, no, reason, to, defend, the, monarchy, after, a, 58, year, reign, on, 15, november, 1889, the, emperor, was, overthrown, in, a, sudden, coup, d, tat, led, by, a, clique, of, military, leaders, whose, goal, was, the, formation, of, a, republic, headed, by, a, dictator, forming, the, first, brazilian, republic, the, territory, which, would, come, to, be, known, as, brazil, was, claimed, by, portugal, on, 22, april, 1500, when, the, navigator, pedro, lvares, cabral, landed, on, its, coast, permanent, settlement, followed, in, 1532, and, for, the, next, 300, years, the, portuguese, slowly, expanded, westwards, until, they, had, reached, nearly, all, of, the, borders, of, modern, brazil, in, 1808, the, army, of, french, emperor, napoleon, i, invaded, portugal, forcing, the, portuguese, royal, family, the, house, of, braganza, a, branch, of, the, thousand, year, old, capetian, dynasty, into, exile, they, re, established, themselves, in, the, brazilian, city, of, rio, de, janeiro, which, became, the, unofficial, seat, of, the, portuguese, empire, in, 1815, the, portuguese, crown, prince, dom, john, later, dom, john, vi, acting, as, regent, created, the, united, kingdom, of, portugal, brazil, and, the, algarves, which, raised, the, status, of, brazil, from, colony, to, kingdom, he, ascended, the, portuguese, throne, the, following, year, after, the, death, of, his, mother, maria, i, of, portugal, he, returned, to, portugal, in, april, 1821, leaving, behind, his, son, and, heir, prince, dom, pedro, to, rule, brazil, as, his, regent, the, portuguese, government, immediately, moved, to, revoke, the, political, autonomy, that, brazil, had, been, granted, since, 1808, the, threat, of, losing, their, limited, control, over, local, affairs, ignited, widespread, opposition, among, brazilians, jos, bonif, cio, de, andrada, along, with, other, brazilian, leaders, convinced, pedro, to, declare, brazil, s, independence, from, portugal, on, 7, september, 1822, on, 12, october, the, prince, was, acclaimed, pedro, i, first, emperor, of, the, newly, created, empire, of, brazil, a, constitutional, monarchy, the, declaration, of, independence, was, opposed, throughout, brazil, by, armed, military, units, loyal, to, portugal, the, ensuing, war, of, independence, was, fought, across, the, country, with, battles, in, the, northern, northeastern, and, southern, regions, the, last, portuguese, soldiers, to, surrender, did, so, in, march, 1824, and, independence, was, recognized, by, portugal, in, august, 1825, pedro, i, encountered, a, number, of, crises, during, his, reign, a, secessionist, rebellion, in, the, cisplatina, province, in, early, 1825, and, the, subsequent, attempt, by, the, united, provinces, of, the, r, o, de, la, plata, later, argentina, to, annex, cisplatina, led, the, empire, into, the, cisplatine, war, a, long, inglorious, and, ultimately, futile, war, in, the, south, in, march, 1826, john, vi, died, and, pedro, i, inherited, the, portuguese, crown, briefly, becoming, king, pedro, iv, of, portugal, before, abdicating, in, favor, of, his, eldest, daughter, maria, ii, the, situation, worsened, in, 1828, when, the, war, in, the, south, ended, with, brazil, s, loss, of, cisplatina, which, would, become, the, independent, republic, of, uruguay, during, the, same, year, in, lisbon, maria, ii, s, throne, was, usurped, by, prince, miguel, pedro, i, s, younger, brother, other, difficulties, arose, when, the, empire, s, parliament, the, general, assembly, opened, in, 1826, pedro, i, along, with, a, significant, percentage, of, the, legislature, argued, for, an, independent, judiciary, a, popularly, elected, legislature, and, a, government, which, would, be, led, by, the, emperor, who, held, broad, executive, powers, and, prerogatives, others, in, parliament, argued, for, a, similar, structure, only, with, a, less, influential, role, for, the, monarch, and, the, legislative, branch, being, dominant, in, policy, and, governance, the, struggle, over, whether, the, government, would, be, dominated, by, the, emperor, or, by, the, parliament, was, carried, over, into, debates, from, 1826, to, 1831, on, the, establishment, of, the, governmental, and, political, structure, unable, to, deal, with, the, problems, in, both, brazil, and, portugal, simultaneously, the, emperor, abdicated, on, behalf, of, his, son, pedro, ii, on, 7, april, 1831, and, immediately, sailed, for, europe, to, restore, his, daughter, to, her, throne, following, the, hasty, departure, of, pedro, i, brazil, was, left, with, a, five, year, old, boy, as, head, of, state, with, no, precedent, to, follow, the, empire, was, faced, with, the, prospect, of, a, period, of, more, than, twelve, years, without, a, strong, executive, as, under, the, constitution, pedro, ii, would, not, attain, his, majority, and, begin, exercising, authority, as, emperor, until, 2, december, 1843, a, regency, was, elected, to, rule, the, country, in, the, interim, because, the, regency, held, few, of, the, powers, exercised, by, an, emperor, and, was, completely, subordinated, to, the, general, assembly, it, could, not, fill, the, vacuum, at, the, apex, of, brazil, s, government, the, hamstrung, regency, proved, unable, to, resolve, disputes, and, rivalries, between, national, and, local, political, factions, believing, that, granting, provincial, and, local, governments, greater, autonomy, would, quell, the, growing, dissent, the, general, assembly, passed, a, constitutional, amendment, in, 1834, called, the, ato, adicional, additional, act, instead, of, ending, the, chaos, these, new, powers, only, fed, local, ambitions, and, rivalries, violence, erupted, throughout, the, country, local, parties, competed, with, renewed, ferocity, to, dominate, provincial, and, municipal, governments, as, whichever, party, dominated, the, provinces, would, also, gain, control, over, the, electoral, and, political, system, those, parties, which, lost, elections, rebelled, and, tried, to, assume, power, by, force, resulting, in, several, rebellions, the, politicians, who, had, risen, to, power, during, the, 1830s, had, by, then, become, familiar, with, the, difficulties, and, pitfalls, of, power, according, to, historian, roderick, j, barman, by, 1840, they, had, lost, all, faith, in, their, ability, to, rule, the, country, on, their, own, they, accepted, pedro, ii, as, an, authority, figure, whose, presence, was, indispensable, for, the, country, s, survival, some, of, these, politicians, who, would, form, the, conservative, party, in, the, 1840s, believed, that, a, neutral, figure, was, required, one, who, could, stand, above, political, factions, and, petty, interests, to, address, discontent, and, moderate, disputes, they, envisioned, an, emperor, who, was, more, dependent, on, the, legislature, than, the, constitutional, monarch, envisioned, by, pedro, i, yet, with, greater, powers, than, had, been, advocated, at, the, beginning, of, the, regency, by, their, rivals, who, later, formed, the, liberal, party, the, liberals, however, contrived, to, pass, an, initiative, to, lower, pedro, ii, s, age, of, majority, from, eighteen, to, fourteen, the, emperor, was, declared, fit, to, rule, in, july, 1840, to, achieve, their, goals, the, liberals, allied, themselves, with, a, group, of, high, ranking, palace, servants, and, notable, politicians, the, courtier, faction, the, courtiers, were, part, of, the, emperor, s, inner, circle, and, had, established, influence, over, him, which, enabled, the, appointment, of, successive, liberal, courtier, cabinets, their, dominance, however, was, short, lived, by, 1846, pedro, ii, had, matured, physically, and, mentally, no, longer, an, insecure, 14, year, old, swayed, by, gossip, suggestions, of, secret, plots, and, other, manipulative, tactics, the, young, emperor, s, weaknesses, faded, and, his, strength, of, character, came, to, the, fore, he, successfully, engineered, the, end, of, the, courtiers, influence, by, removing, them, from, his, inner, circle, without, causing, any, public, disruption, he, also, dismissed, the, liberals, who, had, proved, ineffective, while, in, office, and, called, on, the, conservatives, to, form, a, government, in, 1848, the, abilities, of, the, emperor, and, the, newly, appointed, conservative, cabinet, were, tested, by, three, crises, between, 1848, and, 1852, the, first, crisis, was, a, confrontation, over, the, illegal, importation, of, slaves, importing, slaves, had, been, banned, in, 1826, as, part, of, a, treaty, with, britain, trafficking, continued, unabated, however, and, the, british, government, s, passage, of, the, aberdeen, act, of, 1845, authorized, british, warships, to, board, brazilian, ships, and, seize, anyone, who, was, found, to, be, involved, in, the, slave, trade, while, brazil, grappled, with, this, problem, the, praieira, revolt, a, conflict, between, local, political, factions, within, pernambuco, province, and, one, in, which, liberal, and, courtier, supporters, were, involved, erupted, on, 6, november, 1848, but, was, suppressed, by, march, 1849, it, was, the, last, rebellion, to, occur, during, the, monarchy, and, its, end, marked, the, beginning, of, forty, years, of, internal, peace, in, brazil, the, eus, bio, de, queir, s, law, was, promulgated, on, 4, september, 1850, giving, the, government, broad, authority, to, combat, the, illegal, slave, trade, with, this, new, tool, brazil, moved, to, eliminate, the, importation, of, slaves, and, by, 1852, this, first, crisis, was, over, with, britain, accepting, that, the, trade, had, been, suppressed, the, third, crisis, was, a, conflict, with, the, argentine, confederation, over, ascendancy, in, territories, adjacent, to, the, r, o, de, la, plata, and, free, navigation, of, that, waterway, since, the, 1830s, argentine, dictator, juan, manuel, de, rosas, had, supported, rebellions, within, uruguay, and, brazil, the, empire, was, unable, to, address, the, threat, posed, by, rosas, until, 1850, when, an, alliance, was, forged, between, brazil, uruguay, and, disaffected, argentines, leading, to, the, platine, war, and, the, subsequent, overthrow, of, the, argentine, ruler, in, february, 1852, the, empire, s, successful, navigation, of, these, crises, considerably, enhanced, the, nation, s, stability, and, prestige, and, brazil, emerged, as, a, hemispheric, power, internationally, europeans, came, to, see, the, country, as, embodying, familiar, liberal, ideals, such, as, freedom, of, the, press, and, constitutional, respect, for, civil, liberties, its, representative, parliamentary, monarchy, also, stood, in, stark, contrast, to, the, mix, of, dictatorships, and, instability, endemic, in, the, other, nations, of, south, america, during, this, period, at, the, beginning, of, the, 1850s, brazil, was, enjoying, internal, stability, and, economic, prosperity, the, nation, s, infrastructure, was, being, developed, with, progress, in, the, construction, of, railroads, the, electric, telegraph, and, steamship, lines, uniting, brazil, into, a, cohesive, national, entity, after, five, years, in, office, the, successful, conservative, cabinet, was, dismissed, and, in, september, 1853, hon, rio, hermeto, carneiro, le, o, marquis, of, paran, head, of, the, conservative, party, was, charged, with, forming, a, new, cabinet, emperor, pedro, ii, wanted, to, advance, an, ambitious, plan, which, became, known, as, the, conciliation, aimed, at, strengthening, the, parliament, s, role, in, settling, the, country, s, political, disputes, paran, invited, several, liberals, to, join, the, conservative, ranks, and, went, so, far, as, to, name, some, as, ministers, the, new, cabinet, although, highly, successful, was, plagued, from, the, start, by, strong, opposition, from, ultraconservative, members, of, the, conservative, party, who, repudiated, the, new, liberal, recruits, they, believed, that, the, cabinet, had, become, a, political, machine, infested, with, converted, liberals, who, did, not, genuinely, share, the, party, s, ideals, and, were, primarily, interested, in, gaining, public, offices, despite, this, mistrust, paran, showed, resilience, in, fending, off, threats, and, overcoming, obstacles, and, setbacks, however, in, september, 1856, at, the, height, of, his, career, he, died, unexpectedly, although, the, cabinet, survived, him, until, may, 1857, the, conservative, party, had, split, down, the, middle, on, one, side, were, the, ultraconservatives, and, on, the, other, the, moderate, conservatives, who, supported, the, conciliation, the, ultraconservatives, were, led, by, joaquim, rodrigues, torres, viscount, of, itabora, eus, bio, de, queir, s, and, paulino, soares, de, sousa, 1st, viscount, of, uruguai, all, former, ministers, in, the, 1848, 1853, cabinet, these, elder, statesmen, had, taken, control, of, the, conservative, party, after, paran, s, death, in, the, years, following, 1857, none, of, the, cabinets, survived, long, they, quickly, collapsed, due, to, the, lack, of, a, majority, in, the, chamber, of, deputies, the, remaining, members, of, the, liberal, party, which, had, languished, since, its, fall, in, 1848, and, the, disastrous, praieira, rebellion, in, 1849, took, advantage, of, what, seemed, to, be, the, conservative, party, s, impending, implosion, to, return, to, national, politics, with, renewed, strength, they, delivered, a, powerful, blow, to, the, government, when, they, managed, to, win, several, seats, in, the, chamber, of, deputies, in, 1860, when, many, moderate, conservatives, defected, to, unite, with, liberals, to, form, a, new, political, party, the, progressive, league, the, conservatives, hold, on, power, became, unsustainable, due, to, the, lack, of, a, workable, governing, majority, in, the, parliament, they, resigned, and, in, may, 1862, pedro, ii, named, a, progressive, cabinet, the, period, since, 1853, had, been, one, of, peace, and, prosperity, for, brazil, the, political, system, functioned, smoothly, civil, liberties, were, maintained, a, start, had, been, made, on, the, introduction, into, brazil, of, railroad, telegraph, and, steamship, lines, the, country, was, no, longer, troubled, by, the, disputes, and, conflicts, that, had, racked, it, during, its, first, thirty, years, this, period, of, calm, came, to, an, end, in, 1863, when, the, british, consul, in, rio, de, janeiro, nearly, sparked, a, war, by, issuing, an, abusive, ultimatum, to, brazil, in, response, to, two, minor, incidents, see, christie, question, the, brazilian, government, refused, to, yield, and, the, consul, issued, orders, for, british, warships, to, capture, brazilian, merchant, vessels, as, indemnity, brazil, prepared, itself, for, the, imminent, conflict, and, coastal, defenses, were, given, permission, to, fire, upon, any, british, warship, that, tried, to, capture, brazilian, merchant, ships, the, brazilian, government, then, severed, diplomatic, ties, with, britain, in, june, 1863, as, war, with, the, british, empire, loomed, brazil, had, to, turn, its, attention, to, its, southern, frontiers, another, civil, war, had, begun, in, uruguay, which, pitted, its, political, parties, against, one, another, the, internal, conflict, led, to, the, murder, of, brazilians, and, the, looting, of, their, uruguayan, properties, brazil, s, progressive, cabinet, decided, to, intervene, and, dispatched, an, army, which, invaded, uruguay, in, december, 1864, beginning, the, brief, uruguayan, war, the, dictator, of, nearby, paraguay, francisco, solano, l, pez, took, advantage, of, the, uruguayan, situation, in, late, 1864, by, attempting, to, establish, his, nation, as, a, regional, power, in, november, of, that, year, he, ordered, a, brazilian, civilian, steamship, seized, triggering, the, paraguayan, war, and, then, invaded, brazil, what, had, appeared, at, the, outset, to, be, a, brief, and, straightforward, military, intervention, led, to, a, full, scale, war, in, south, america, s, southeast, however, the, possibility, of, a, two, front, conflict, with, britain, and, paraguay, faded, when, in, september, 1865, the, british, government, sent, an, envoy, who, publicly, apologized, for, the, crisis, between, the, empires, the, paraguayan, invasion, in, 1864, led, to, a, conflict, far, longer, than, expected, and, faith, in, the, progressive, cabinet, s, ability, to, prosecute, the, war, vanished, also, from, its, inception, the, progressive, league, was, plagued, by, internal, conflict, between, factions, formed, by, former, moderate, conservatives, and, by, former, liberals, the, cabinet, resigned, and, the, emperor, named, the, aging, viscount, of, itabora, to, head, a, new, cabinet, in, july, 1868, marking, the, return, of, the, conservatives, to, power, this, impelled, both, progressive, wings, to, set, aside, their, differences, leading, them, to, rechristen, their, party, as, the, liberal, party, a, third, smaller, and, radical, progressive, wing, would, declare, itself, republican, in, 1870, an, ominous, signal, for, the, monarchy, nonetheless, the, ministry, formed, by, the, viscount, of, itabora, was, a, far, abler, body, than, the, cabinet, it, replaced, and, the, conflict, with, paraguay, ended, in, march, 1870, with, total, victory, for, brazil, and, its, allies, more, than, 50, 000, brazilian, soldiers, had, died, and, war, costs, were, eleven, times, the, government, s, annual, budget, however, the, country, was, so, prosperous, that, the, government, was, able, to, retire, the, war, debt, in, only, ten, years, the, conflict, was, also, a, stimulus, to, national, production, and, economic, growth, the, diplomatic, victory, over, the, british, empire, and, the, military, victory, over, uruguay, in, 1865, followed, by, the, successful, conclusion, of, the, war, with, paraguay, in, 1870, marked, the, beginning, of, the, golden, age, of, the, brazilian, empire, the, brazilian, economy, grew, rapidly, railroad, shipping, and, other, modernization, projects, were, started, immigration, flourished, the, empire, became, known, internationally, as, a, modern, and, progressive, nation, second, only, to, the, united, states, in, the, americas, it, was, a, politically, stable, economy, with, a, good, investment, potential, in, march, 1871, pedro, ii, named, the, conservative, jos, paranhos, viscount, of, rio, branco, as, the, head, of, a, cabinet, whose, main, goal, was, to, pass, a, law, to, immediately, free, all, children, born, to, female, slaves, the, controversial, bill, was, introduced, in, the, chamber, of, deputies, in, may, and, faced, a, determined, opposition, which, commanded, support, from, about, one, third, of, the, deputies, and, which, sought, to, organize, public, opinion, against, the, measure, the, bill, was, finally, promulgated, in, september, and, became, known, as, the, law, of, free, birth, rio, branco, s, success, however, seriously, damaged, the, long, term, political, stability, of, the, empire, the, law, split, the, conservatives, down, the, middle, one, party, faction, backed, the, reforms, of, the, rio, branco, cabinet, while, the, second, known, as, the, escravocratas, english, slavocrats, were, unrelenting, in, their, opposition, forming, a, new, generation, of, ultraconservatives, the, law, of, free, birth, and, pedro, ii, s, support, for, it, resulted, in, the, loss, of, the, ultraconservatives, unconditional, loyalty, to, the, monarchy, the, conservative, party, had, experienced, serious, divisions, before, during, the, 1850s, when, the, emperor, s, total, support, for, the, conciliation, policy, had, given, rise, to, the, progressives, the, ultraconservatives, led, by, eus, bio, uruguai, and, itabora, who, opposed, conciliation, in, the, 1850s, had, nonetheless, believed, that, the, emperor, was, indispensable, to, the, functioning, of, the, political, system, the, emperor, was, an, ultimate, and, impartial, arbiter, when, political, deadlock, threatened, by, contrast, this, new, generation, of, ultraconservatives, had, not, experienced, the, regency, and, early, years, of, pedro, ii, s, reign, when, external, and, internal, dangers, had, threatened, the, empire, s, very, existence, they, had, only, known, prosperity, peace, and, a, stable, administration, to, them, and, to, the, ruling, classes, in, general, the, presence, of, a, neutral, monarch, who, could, settle, political, disputes, was, no, longer, important, furthermore, since, pedro, ii, had, clearly, taken, a, political, side, on, the, slavery, question, he, had, compromised, his, position, as, a, neutral, arbiter, the, young, ultraconservative, politicians, saw, no, reason, to, uphold, or, defend, the, imperial, office, the, weaknesses, in, the, monarchy, took, many, years, to, become, apparent, brazil, continued, to, prosper, during, the, 1880s, with, the, economy, and, society, both, developing, rapidly, including, the, first, organized, push, for, women, s, rights, which, would, progress, slowly, over, the, next, decades, by, contrast, letters, written, by, pedro, ii, reveal, a, man, grown, world, weary, with, age, increasingly, alienated, from, current, events, and, pessimistic, in, outlook, he, remained, diligent, in, performing, his, formal, duties, as, emperor, albeit, often, without, enthusiasm, but, he, no, longer, actively, intervened, to, maintain, stability, in, the, country, his, increasing, indifference, towards, the, fate, of, the, regime, and, his, inaction, to, protect, the, imperial, system, once, it, came, under, threat, have, led, historians, to, attribute, the, prime, perhaps, sole, responsibility, for, the, dissolution, of, the, monarchy, to, the, emperor, himself, the, lack, of, an, heir, who, could, feasibly, provide, a, new, direction, for, the, nation, also, threatened, the, long, term, prospects, for, the, brazilian, monarchy, the, emperor, s, heir, was, his, eldest, daughter, isabel, the, princess, imperial, who, had, no, interest, in, nor, expectation, of, becoming, the, monarch, even, though, the, constitution, allowed, female, succession, to, the, throne, brazil, was, still, a, very, traditional, male, dominated, society, and, the, prevailing, view, was, that, only, a, male, monarch, would, be, capable, as, head, of, state, pedro, ii, the, ruling, circles, and, the, wider, political, establishment, all, considered, a, female, successor, to, be, inappropriate, and, pedro, ii, himself, believed, that, the, death, of, his, two, sons, and, the, lack, of, a, male, heir, were, a, sign, that, the, empire, was, destined, to, be, supplanted, a, weary, emperor, who, no, longer, cared, for, the, throne, an, heir, who, had, no, desire, to, assume, the, crown, an, increasingly, discontented, ruling, class, who, were, dismissive, of, the, imperial, role, in, national, affairs, all, these, factors, presaged, the, monarchy, s, impending, doom, the, means, to, achieve, the, overthrow, of, the, imperial, system, would, soon, appear, within, the, army, ranks, republicanism, had, never, flourished, in, brazil, outside, of, certain, elitist, circles, and, had, little, support, in, the, provinces, a, growing, combination, of, republican, and, positivist, ideals, among, the, army, s, junior, and, mid, level, officer, ranks, however, began, to, form, a, serious, threat, to, the, monarchy, these, officers, favored, a, republican, dictatorship, which, they, believed, would, be, superior, to, the, liberal, democratic, monarchy, beginning, with, small, acts, of, insubordination, at, the, beginning, of, the, 1880s, discontent, in, the, army, grew, in, scope, and, audacity, during, the, decade, as, the, emperor, was, uninterested, and, the, politicians, proved, incapable, of, re, establishing, the, government, s, authority, over, the, military, the, nation, enjoyed, considerable, international, prestige, during, the, final, years, of, the, empire, and, had, become, an, emerging, power, in, the, international, arena, while, pedro, ii, was, receiving, medical, treatment, in, europe, the, parliament, passed, and, princess, isabel, signed, on, 13, may, 1888, the, golden, law, which, completely, abolished, slavery, in, brazil, predictions, of, economic, and, labor, disruption, caused, by, the, abolition, of, slavery, proved, to, be, unfounded, nonetheless, the, end, of, slavery, was, the, final, blow, to, any, remaining, belief, in, the, crown, s, neutrality, and, this, resulted, in, an, explicit, shift, of, support, to, republicanism, by, the, ultraconservatives, themselves, backed, by, rich, and, powerful, coffee, farmers, who, held, great, political, economic, and, social, power, in, the, country, to, avert, a, republican, backlash, the, government, exploited, the, credit, readily, available, to, brazil, as, a, result, of, its, prosperity, to, fuel, further, development, the, government, extended, massive, loans, at, favorable, interest, rates, to, plantation, owners, and, lavishly, granted, titles, and, lesser, honors, to, curry, favor, with, influential, political, figures, who, had, become, disaffected, the, government, also, indirectly, began, to, address, the, problem, of, the, recalcitrant, military, by, revitalizing, the, moribund, national, guard, by, then, an, entity, which, existed, mostly, only, on, paper, the, measures, taken, by, the, government, alarmed, civilian, republicans, and, the, positivists, in, the, military, the, republicans, saw, that, it, would, undercut, support, for, their, own, aims, and, were, emboldened, to, further, action, the, reorganization, of, the, national, guard, was, begun, by, the, cabinet, in, august, 1889, and, the, creation, of, a, rival, force, caused, the, dissidents, among, the, officer, corps, to, consider, desperate, measures, for, both, groups, republicans, and, military, it, had, become, a, case, of, now, or, never, although, there, was, no, desire, among, the, majority, of, brazilians, to, change, the, country, s, form, of, government, republicans, began, pressuring, army, officers, to, overthrow, the, monarchy, they, launched, a, coup, and, instituted, the, republic, on, 15, november, 1889, the, few, people, who, witnessed, what, occurred, did, not, realize, that, it, was, a, rebellion, historian, l, dia, besouchet, noted, that, arely, has, a, revolution, been, so, minor, throughout, the, coup, pedro, ii, showed, no, emotion, as, if, unconcerned, about, the, outcome, he, dismissed, all, suggestions, put, forward, by, politicians, and, military, leaders, for, quelling, the, rebellion, the, emperor, and, his, family, were, sent, into, exile, on, 17, november, although, there, was, significant, monarchist, reaction, after, the, fall, of, the, empire, this, was, thoroughly, suppressed, and, neither, pedro, ii, nor, his, daughter, supported, a, restoration, despite, being, unaware, of, the, plans, for, a, coup, once, it, occurred, and, in, light, of, the, emperor, s, passive, acceptance, of, the, situation, the, political, establishment, supported, the, end, of, the, monarchy, in, favor, of, a, republic, they, were, unaware, that, the, goal, of, the, coup, leaders, was, the, creation, of, a, dictatorial, republic, rather, than, a, presidential, or, parliamentary, republic, article, 2, of, brazil, s, 1824, constitution, defined, the, roles, of, both, the, emperor, and, the, general, assembly, of, brazil, which, in, 1824, was, composed, of, 50, senators, and, 102, general, deputies, as, the, nation, s, representatives, the, constitution, endowed, the, assembly, with, both, status, and, authority, and, created, legislative, moderating, executive, and, judicial, branches, as, delegations, of, the, nation, with, the, separation, of, those, powers, envisaged, as, providing, balances, in, support, of, the, constitution, and, the, rights, it, enshrined, the, prerogatives, and, authority, granted, to, the, legislature, within, the, constitution, meant, that, it, could, and, would, play, a, major, and, indispensable, role, in, the, functioning, of, the, government, it, was, not, a, mere, rubber, stamp, the, general, assembly, alone, could, enact, revoke, interpret, and, suspend, laws, under, article, 13, of, the, constitution, the, legislature, also, held, the, power, of, the, purse, and, was, required, to, annually, authorize, expenditures, and, taxes, it, alone, approved, and, exercised, oversight, of, government, loans, and, debts, other, responsibilities, entrusted, to, the, assembly, included, setting, the, size, of, the, military, s, forces, the, creation, of, offices, within, the, government, monitoring, the, national, welfare, and, ensuring, that, the, government, was, being, run, in, conformity, to, the, constitution, this, last, provision, allowed, the, legislature, wide, authority, to, examine, and, debate, government, policy, and, conduct, regarding, matters, of, foreign, policy, the, constitution, under, article, 102, required, that, the, general, assembly, be, consulted, about, declarations, of, war, treaties, and, the, conduct, of, international, relations, a, determined, legislator, could, exploit, these, constitutional, provisions, to, block, or, limit, government, decisions, influence, appointments, and, force, reconsideration, of, policies, during, its, annual, four, month, sessions, the, assembly, conducted, public, debates, these, were, widely, reported, and, formed, a, national, forum, for, the, expression, of, public, concerns, from, all, parts, of, the, country, it, was, frequently, a, venue, for, expressing, opposition, to, policies, and, airing, grievances, legislators, enjoyed, immunity, from, prosecution, for, speeches, made, from, the, floor, and, in, the, discharge, of, their, offices, only, their, own, chambers, within, the, assembly, could, order, the, arrest, of, a, member, during, his, tenure, with, no, actual, responsibility, for, the, actual, conduct, of, affairs, the, legislators, were, free, to, propose, sweeping, reforms, advocate, ideal, solutions, and, denounce, compromising, and, opportunistic, conduct, by, the, government, the, emperor, was, the, head, of, both, the, moderating, and, executive, branches, being, aided, by, the, council, of, state, and, the, council, of, ministers, respectively, he, had, the, final, say, and, held, ultimate, control, over, the, national, government, he, was, tasked, with, ensuring, national, independence, and, stability, the, constitution, article, 101, gave, him, very, few, avenues, for, imposing, his, will, upon, the, general, assembly, his, main, recourse, was, the, right, to, dissolve, or, extend, legislative, sessions, in, the, senate, an, emperor, s, authority, to, appoint, senators, did, not, necessarily, give, him, added, influence, since, senators, held, their, offices, for, life, and, were, thus, freed, from, government, pressure, once, confirmed, on, those, occasions, when, the, chamber, of, deputies, was, dissolved, new, elections, were, required, to, be, held, immediately, and, the, new, chamber, seated, this, power, was, effective, when, held, in, reserve, as, a, threat, it, could, not, be, employed, repeatedly, nor, would, its, use, work, to, the, emperor, s, advantage, during, the, reign, of, pedro, i, the, chamber, of, deputies, was, never, dissolved, and, legislative, sessions, were, never, extended, or, postponed, under, pedro, ii, the, chamber, of, deputies, was, only, ever, dissolved, at, the, request, of, the, president, of, the, council, of, ministers, prime, minister, there, were, eleven, dissolutions, during, pedro, ii, s, reign, and, of, these, ten, occurred, after, consultation, with, the, council, of, state, which, was, beyond, what, was, required, by, the, constitution, a, constitutional, balance, of, power, existed, between, the, general, assembly, and, the, executive, branch, under, the, emperor, the, legislature, could, not, operate, alone, and, the, monarch, could, not, force, his, will, upon, the, assembly, in, practice, the, system, functioned, smoothly, only, when, both, assembly, and, emperor, acted, in, a, spirit, of, cooperation, for, the, national, good, a, new, element, was, added, when, the, office, of, president, of, the, council, of, ministers, was, formally, created, in, 1847, although, the, role, had, existed, informally, since, 1843, the, president, of, the, council, owed, his, position, to, both, his, party, and, to, the, emperor, and, these, could, sometimes, come, into, conflict, 19th, century, abolitionist, leader, and, historian, joaquim, nabuco, said, that, the, president, of, the, council, in, brazil, was, no, russian, chancellor, sovereign, s, creature, nor, a, british, prime, minister, made, only, by, the, trust, of, the, commons, the, delegation, of, the, crown, was, to, him, as, necessary, and, important, as, the, delegation, of, the, chamber, and, to, exert, with, safety, his, functions, he, had, to, dominate, the, caprice, the, oscillations, and, ambitions, of, the, parliament, as, well, as, to, preserve, always, unalterable, the, favor, the, good, will, of, the, emperor, when, enacted, in, 1824, the, imperial, constitution, created, the, conselho, geral, de, prov, ncia, provincial, general, council, the, legislature, of, the, provinces, this, council, was, composed, of, either, 21, or, 13, elected, members, depending, on, the, size, of, a, province, s, population, all, resolutions, laws, created, by, the, councils, required, approval, by, the, general, assembly, with, no, right, of, appeal, provincial, councils, also, had, no, authority, to, raise, revenues, and, their, budgets, had, to, be, debated, and, ratified, by, the, general, assembly, provinces, had, no, autonomy, and, were, entirely, subordinate, to, the, national, government, with, the, 1834, constitutional, amendment, known, as, the, additional, act, provincial, general, councils, were, supplanted, by, the, assembleias, legislativas, provinciais, provincial, legislative, assemblies, the, new, assemblies, enjoyed, much, greater, autonomy, from, the, national, government, a, provincial, assembly, was, composed, of, 36, 28, or, 20, elected, deputies, the, number, depending, on, the, size, of, the, province, s, population, the, election, of, provincial, deputies, followed, the, same, procedure, as, used, to, elect, general, deputies, to, the, national, chamber, of, deputies, the, responsibilities, of, the, provincial, assembly, included, defining, provincial, and, municipal, budgets, and, levying, the, taxes, necessary, to, support, them, providing, primary, and, secondary, schools, higher, education, was, the, responsibility, of, the, national, government, oversight, and, control, of, provincial, and, municipal, expenditures, and, providing, for, law, enforcement, and, maintenance, of, police, forces, the, assemblies, also, controlled, the, creation, and, abolishment, of, and, salaries, for, positions, within, provincial, and, municipal, civil, services, the, nomination, suspension, and, dismissal, of, civil, servants, was, reserved, for, the, president, governor, of, the, province, but, how, and, under, what, circumstances, he, could, exercise, these, prerogatives, was, delineated, by, the, assembly, the, expropriation, of, private, property, with, due, monetary, compensation, for, provincial, or, municipal, interests, was, also, a, right, of, the, assembly, in, effect, the, provincial, assembly, could, enact, any, kind, of, law, with, no, ratification, by, parliament, so, long, as, such, local, laws, did, not, violate, or, encroach, upon, the, constitution, however, provinces, were, not, permitted, to, legislate, in, the, areas, of, criminal, law, criminal, procedure, laws, civil, rights, and, obligations, the, armed, forces, the, national, budget, or, matters, concerning, national, interests, such, as, foreign, relations, the, provincial, presidents, were, appointed, by, the, national, government, and, were, in, theory, charged, with, governing, the, province, in, practice, however, their, power, was, intangible, varying, from, province, to, province, based, upon, each, president, s, relative, degree, of, personal, influence, and, personal, character, since, the, national, government, wanted, to, ensure, their, loyalty, presidents, were, in, most, cases, sent, to, a, province, in, which, they, had, no, political, familial, or, other, ties, to, prevent, them, from, developing, any, strong, local, interests, or, support, presidents, would, be, limited, to, terms, of, only, a, few, months, in, office, as, the, president, usually, spent, a, great, deal, of, time, away, from, the, province, often, traveling, to, their, native, province, or, the, imperial, capital, the, de, facto, governor, was, the, vice, president, who, was, chosen, by, the, provincial, assembly, and, was, usually, a, local, politician, with, little, power, to, undermine, provincial, autonomy, the, president, was, an, agent, of, the, central, government, with, little, function, beyond, conveying, its, interests, to, the, provincial, political, bosses, presidents, could, be, used, by, the, national, government, to, influence, or, even, rig, elections, although, to, be, effective, the, president, had, to, rely, on, provincial, and, local, politicians, who, belonged, to, his, own, political, party, this, interdependency, created, a, complex, relationship, which, was, based, upon, exchanges, of, favors, private, interests, party, goals, negotiations, and, other, political, maneuvering, the, c, mara, municipal, town, council, was, the, governing, body, in, towns, and, cities, and, had, existed, in, brazil, since, the, beginning, of, the, colonial, period, in, the, 16th, century, the, chamber, was, composed, of, vereadores, councilmen, the, number, of, which, depended, on, the, size, of, the, town, unlike, the, provincial, general, council, the, constitution, gave, town, councils, great, autonomy, however, when, the, provincial, assembly, replaced, the, provincial, general, council, in, 1834, many, of, the, powers, of, town, councils, including, the, setting, of, municipal, budgets, oversight, of, expenditures, creation, of, jobs, and, the, nomination, of, civil, servants, were, transferred, to, the, provincial, government, additionally, any, laws, enacted, by, the, town, council, had, to, be, ratified, by, the, provincial, assembly, but, not, by, parliament, while, the, 1834, additional, act, granted, greater, autonomy, to, the, provinces, from, the, central, government, it, transferred, the, towns, remaining, autonomy, to, the, provincial, governments, there, was, no, office, of, mayor, and, towns, were, governed, by, a, town, council, and, its, president, who, was, the, councilman, who, won, the, most, votes, during, elections, until, 1881, voting, was, mandatory, and, elections, occurred, in, two, stages, in, the, first, phase, voters, chose, electors, who, then, selected, a, slate, of, senatorial, candidates, the, emperor, would, choose, a, new, senator, member, of, the, senate, the, upper, house, in, the, general, assembly, from, a, list, of, the, three, candidates, who, had, received, the, highest, number, of, votes, the, electors, also, chose, the, general, deputies, members, of, the, chamber, of, deputies, the, lower, house, provincial, deputies, members, of, the, provincial, assemblies, and, councilmen, members, of, the, town, councils, without, the, involvement, of, the, emperor, in, making, a, final, selection, all, men, over, the, age, of, 25, with, an, annual, income, of, at, least, rs, 100, 000, or, 100, 000, r, is, the, equivalent, in, 1824, to, 98, u, s, were, eligible, to, vote, in, the, first, phase, the, voting, age, was, lowered, to, 21, for, married, men, to, become, an, elector, it, was, necessary, to, have, an, annual, income, of, at, least, rs, 200, 000, the, brazilian, system, was, relatively, democratic, for, a, period, during, which, indirect, elections, were, common, in, democracies, the, income, requirement, was, much, higher, in, the, united, kingdom, even, after, the, reforms, of, 1832, at, the, time, the, only, nations, not, requiring, a, minimum, level, of, income, as, a, qualification, for, voting, were, france, and, switzerland, where, universal, suffrage, was, introduced, only, in, 1848, it, is, probable, that, no, european, country, at, the, time, had, such, liberal, legislation, as, brazil, the, income, requirement, was, low, enough, that, any, employed, male, citizen, could, qualify, to, vote, as, an, illustration, the, lowest, paid, civil, employee, in, 1876, was, a, janitor, who, earned, rs, 600, 000, annually, most, voters, in, brazil, had, a, low, income, for, example, in, the, minas, gerais, town, of, formiga, in, 1876, the, poor, constituted, 70, of, the, electorate, in, iraj, in, the, province, of, rio, de, janeiro, the, poor, were, 87, of, the, electorate, former, slaves, could, not, vote, but, their, children, and, grandchildren, could, as, could, the, illiterate, which, few, countries, allowed, in, 1872, 10, 8, of, the, brazilian, population, voted, 13, of, the, non, slave, population, by, comparison, electoral, participation, in, the, uk, in, 1870, was, 7, of, the, total, population, in, italy, it, was, 2, in, portugal, 9, and, in, the, netherlands, 2, 5, in, 1832, the, year, of, the, british, electoral, reform, 3, of, the, british, voted, further, reforms, in, 1867, and, 1884, expanded, electoral, participation, in, the, uk, to, 15, although, electoral, fraud, was, common, it, was, not, ignored, by, the, emperor, politicians, or, observers, of, the, time, the, problem, was, considered, a, major, issue, and, attempts, were, made, to, correct, abuses, with, legislation, including, the, electoral, reforms, of, 1855, 1875, and, 1881, repeatedly, being, enacted, to, combat, fraud, the, 1881, reforms, brought, significant, changes, they, eliminated, the, two, stage, electoral, system, introduced, direct, and, facultative, voting, and, allowed, the, votes, of, former, slaves, and, enfranchised, non, catholics, conversely, illiterate, citizens, were, no, longer, allowed, to, vote, participation, in, elections, dropped, from, 13, to, only, 0, 8, in, 1886, in, 1889, about, 15, of, the, brazilian, population, could, read, and, write, so, disenfranchising, the, illiterate, does, not, solely, explain, the, sudden, fall, in, voting, percentages, the, discontinuation, of, mandatory, voting, and, voter, apathy, may, have, been, significant, factors, contributing, to, the, reduction, in, the, number, of, voters, under, articles, 102, and, 148, of, the, constitution, the, armed, forces, were, subordinate, to, the, emperor, as, commander, in, chief, he, was, aided, by, the, ministry, of, war, and, ministry, of, navy, in, matters, concerning, the, army, and, the, armada, navy, although, the, president, of, the, council, of, ministers, usually, exercised, oversight, of, both, branches, in, practice, the, ministers, of, war, and, navy, were, with, few, exceptions, civilians, the, military, was, organized, along, similar, lines, to, the, british, and, american, armed, forces, of, the, time, in, which, a, small, standing, army, could, quickly, augment, its, strength, during, emergencies, from, a, reserve, militia, force, in, brazil, the, national, guard, brazil, s, first, line, of, defense, relied, upon, a, large, and, powerful, navy, to, protect, against, foreign, attack, as, a, matter, of, policy, the, military, was, to, be, completely, obedient, to, civilian, governmental, control, and, to, remain, at, arm, s, length, from, involvement, in, political, decisions, military, personnel, were, allowed, to, run, for, and, serve, in, political, office, while, remaining, on, active, duty, however, they, did, not, represent, the, army, or, the, armada, but, were, instead, expected, to, serve, the, interests, of, the, city, or, province, which, had, elected, them, pedro, i, chose, nine, military, officers, as, senators, and, appointed, five, out, of, fourteen, to, the, council, of, state, during, the, regency, two, were, named, to, the, senate, and, none, to, the, council, of, state, this, body, was, dormant, during, the, regency, pedro, ii, chose, four, officers, as, senators, during, the, 1840s, two, in, the, 1850s, and, three, others, during, the, remaining, years, of, his, reign, he, also, appointed, seven, officers, to, be, state, councilors, during, the, 1840s, and, 1850s, and, three, others, after, that, the, brazilian, armed, forces, were, created, in, the, aftermath, of, independence, they, were, originally, composed, of, brazilian, and, portuguese, born, officers, and, troops, who, had, remained, loyal, to, the, government, in, rio, de, janeiro, during, the, war, of, secession, from, portugal, the, armed, forces, were, crucial, to, the, successful, outcomes, of, international, conflicts, faced, by, the, empire, starting, with, independence, 1822, 1824, followed, by, the, cisplatine, war, 1825, 1828, then, the, platine, war, 1851, 1852, the, uruguayan, war, 1864, 1865, and, finally, the, paraguayan, war, 1864, 1870, they, also, played, a, part, in, quelling, rebellions, beginning, with, the, confederation, of, the, equator, 1824, under, pedro, i, followed, by, the, uprisings, during, pedro, ii, s, early, reign, such, as, the, ragamuffin, war, 1835, 1845, cabanagem, 1835, 1840, balaiada, 1838, 1841, among, others, the, armada, was, constantly, being, modernized, with, the, latest, developments, in, naval, warfare, it, adopted, steam, navigation, in, the, 1830s, ironclad, plate, armor, in, the, 1860s, and, torpedoes, in, the, 1880s, by, 1889, brazil, had, the, fifth, or, sixth, most, powerful, navy, in, the, world, and, the, most, powerful, battleships, in, the, western, hemisphere, the, army, despite, its, highly, experienced, and, battle, hardened, officer, corps, was, plagued, during, peacetime, by, units, which, were, badly, paid, inadequately, equipped, poorly, trained, and, thinly, spread, across, the, vast, empire, dissension, resulting, from, inadequate, government, attention, to, army, needs, was, restrained, under, the, generation, of, officers, who, had, begun, their, careers, during, the, 1820s, these, officers, were, loyal, to, the, monarchy, believed, the, military, should, be, under, civilian, control, and, abhorred, the, caudillism, hispanic, american, dictatorships, against, which, they, had, fought, but, by, the, early, 1880s, this, generation, including, commanders, such, as, the, duke, of, caxias, the, count, of, porto, alegre, and, the, marquis, of, erval, had, died, were, retired, or, no, longer, exercised, direct, command, dissatisfaction, became, more, evident, during, the, 1880s, and, some, officers, began, to, display, open, insubordination, the, emperor, and, the, politicians, did, nothing, to, improve, the, military, nor, meet, their, demands, the, dissemination, of, positivist, ideology, among, young, officers, brought, further, complications, as, positivism, opposed, the, monarchy, under, the, belief, that, a, dictatorial, republic, would, bring, improvements, a, coalition, between, a, mutinous, army, faction, and, the, positivist, camp, was, formed, and, directly, led, to, the, republican, coup, on, 15, november, 1889, battalions, and, even, full, regiments, of, soldiers, loyal, to, the, empire, who, shared, the, ideals, of, the, older, generation, of, leaders, attempted, to, restore, the, monarchy, attempts, at, a, restoration, proved, futile, and, supporters, of, the, empire, were, executed, arrested, or, forcibly, retired, upon, independence, from, portugal, the, immediate, focus, of, brazil, s, foreign, policy, was, to, gain, widespread, international, recognition, there, is, no, consensus, about, which, countries, were, the, first, to, recognize, the, independence, of, brazil, according, to, historian, toby, green, they, were, the, african, states, of, dahomey, and, onim, in, 1822, and, 1823, respectively, while, researcher, rodrigo, wiese, randig, argues, that, it, was, the, united, provinces, of, the, r, o, de, la, plata, around, june, 1823, followed, by, the, united, states, in, may, 1824, and, the, kingdom, of, benin, in, july, 1824, other, nations, followed, in, establishing, diplomatic, relations, over, the, next, few, years, portugal, recognized, the, separation, in, august, 1825, the, brazilian, government, subsequently, made, it, a, priority, to, establish, its, international, borders, through, treaties, with, its, neighbors, the, task, of, securing, recognized, frontiers, was, complicated, by, the, fact, that, between, 1777, and, 1801, portugal, and, spain, had, annulled, their, previous, treaties, setting, out, the, borders, between, their, american, colonial, empires, however, the, empire, was, able, to, sign, several, bilateral, treaties, with, neighbors, including, uruguay, 1851, peru, 1851, and, 1874, the, republic, of, new, granada, later, colombia, 1853, venezuela, 1859, bolivia, 1867, and, paraguay, 1872, by, 1889, most, of, its, borders, were, firmly, established, the, remaining, issues, including, the, purchase, of, the, region, of, acre, from, bolivia, which, would, give, brazil, its, present, day, configuration, were, only, finally, resolved, after, the, country, became, a, republic, a, number, of, conflicts, occurred, between, the, empire, and, its, neighbors, brazil, experienced, no, serious, conflicts, with, its, neighbors, to, the, north, and, west, due, to, the, buffer, of, the, nearly, impenetrable, and, sparsely, populated, amazonian, rainforest, in, the, south, however, the, colonial, disputes, inherited, from, portugal, and, spain, over, the, control, of, the, navigable, rivers, and, plains, which, formed, the, frontiers, continued, after, independence, the, lack, of, mutually, agreed, borders, in, this, area, led, to, several, international, conflicts, from, the, cisplatine, war, to, the, paraguayan, war, brazil, is, next, to, ourselves, the, great, power, on, the, american, continent, affirmed, james, watson, webb, the, u, s, minister, to, brazil, in, 1867, the, empire, s, rise, was, noticed, as, early, as, 1844, by, john, c, calhoun, the, u, s, secretary, of, state, next, to, the, united, states, brazil, is, the, most, wealthy, the, greatest, and, the, most, firmly, established, of, all, the, american, powers, by, the, early, 1870s, the, international, reputation, of, the, empire, of, brazil, had, improved, considerably, and, it, remained, well, regarded, internationally, until, its, end, in, 1889, christopher, columbus, andrews, an, american, diplomat, in, the, brazilian, capital, in, the, 1880s, later, recalled, brazil, as, an, important, empire, in, his, memoirs, in, 1871, brazil, was, invited, to, arbitrate, the, dispute, between, the, united, states, and, britain, which, became, known, as, the, alabama, claims, in, 1880, the, empire, acted, as, arbiter, between, the, united, states, and, france, over, the, damage, caused, to, u, s, nationals, during, the, french, intervention, in, mexico, in, 1884, brazil, was, called, upon, to, arbitrate, between, chile, and, several, other, nations, namely, france, italy, britain, germany, belgium, austria, hungary, and, switzerland, over, damages, arising, from, the, war, of, the, pacific, the, brazilian, government, eventually, felt, confident, enough, to, negotiate, a, trade, deal, with, the, united, states, in, 1889, the, first, to, be, undertaken, with, any, nation, since, the, disastrous, and, exploitative, trade, treaty, with, britain, in, 1826, canceled, in, 1844, american, historian, steven, c, topik, said, that, pedro, ii, s, quest, for, a, trade, treaty, with, the, united, states, was, part, of, a, grander, strategy, to, increase, national, sovereignty, and, autonomy, unlike, the, circumstances, of, the, previous, pact, the, empire, was, in, a, strong, position, to, insist, on, favorable, trade, terms, as, negotiations, occurred, during, a, time, of, brazilian, domestic, prosperity, and, international, prestige, the, unit, of, currency, from, the, empire, s, founding, and, until, 1942, was, the, real, royal, in, english, its, plural, form, was, r, is, and, is, reais, in, modern, portuguese, and, was, derived, from, the, portuguese, real, it, was, usually, called, milr, is, english,

written, before, the, value, and, by, a, dollar, sign, was, written, before, any, amounts, lower, than, 1, 000, r, is, thus, 350, r, is, was, written, as, rs, 350, 1, 712, r, is, as, rs, 1, 712, and, 1, 020, 800, r, is, was, written, as, rs, 1, 020, 800, for, millions, a, period, was, used, as, a, separator, between, millions, billions, trillions, etc, e, g, 1, billion, r, is, was, written, as, rs, 1, 000, 000, 000, a, colon, functioned, to, separate, millions, from, thousands, and, the, sign, typically, written, as, was, inserted, between, thousands, and, hundreds, 999, or, fewer, brazil, s, international, trade, reached, a, total, value, of, rs, 79, 000, 000, 000, between, 1834, and, 1839, this, continued, to, increase, every, year, until, it, reached, rs, 472, 000, 000, 000, between, 1886, and, 1887, an, annual, growth, rate, of, 3, 88, since, 1839, the, absolute, value, of, exports, from, the, empire, in, 1850, was, the, highest, in, latin, america, and, triple, that, of, argentina, which, was, in, fourth, place, brazil, would, keep, its, high, standing, in, exports, and, general, economic, growth, until, the, end, of, the, monarchy, brazilian, economic, expansion, especially, after, 1850, compared, well, with, that, of, the, united, states, and, european, nations, the, national, tax, revenue, amounted, to, rs, 11, 795, 000, 000, in, 1831, and, rose, to, rs, 160, 840, 000, 000, in, 1889, by, 1858, national, tax, revenues, ranked, as, the, eighth, largest, in, the, world, imperial, brazil, was, despite, its, progress, a, country, where, wealth, was, very, unequally, distributed, however, for, purposes, of, comparison, according, to, historian, steven, c, topik, in, the, united, states, by, 1890, 80, percent, of, the, population, lived, on, the, margin, of, subsistence, while, 20, percent, controlled, almost, all, wealth, as, new, technologies, appeared, and, with, increases, in, internal, productivity, exports, increased, considerably, this, made, it, possible, to, reach, equilibrium, in, the, balance, of, trade, during, the, 1820s, sugar, constituted, about, 30, of, total, exports, while, cotton, constituted, 21, coffee, 18, and, leather, and, skins, 14, twenty, years, later, coffee, would, reach, 42, sugar, 27, leather, and, skins, 9, and, cotton, 8, of, the, total, exports, this, did, not, mean, a, reduction, in, the, production, of, any, of, these, items, and, in, fact, the, opposite, occurred, growth, occurred, in, all, sectors, some, more, than, others, in, the, period, between, 1820, and, 1840, fausto, says, brazilian, exports, had, doubled, in, volume, and, had, tripled, in, nominal, value, while, the, valuation, denominated, in, pounds, sterling, increased, by, over, 40, brazil, was, not, the, only, country, where, agriculture, played, an, important, role, on, exports, around, 1890, in, the, united, states, by, then, the, richest, nation, in, the, americas, agricultural, goods, represented, 80, of, all, its, exports, in, the, 1820s, brazil, exported, 11, 000, tons, of, cacao, and, by, 1880, this, had, increased, to, 73, 500, tons, between, 1821, and, 1825, 41, 174, tons, of, sugar, were, exported, rising, to, 238, 074, tons, between, 1881, and, 1885, until, 1850, rubber, production, was, insignificant, but, between, 1881, and, 1890, it, had, reached, third, place, among, brazilian, exports, this, was, about, 81, tons, between, 1827, and, 1830, reaching, 1, 632, tons, in, 1852, by, 1900, the, country, was, exporting, 24, 301, 452, tons, of, rubber, brazil, also, exported, around, 3, 377, 000, tons, of, coffee, between, 1821, and, 1860, while, between, 1861, and, 1889, this, reached, 6, 804, 000, tons, technological, innovations, also, contributed, to, the, growth, of, exports, in, particular, the, adoption, of, steam, navigation, and, railroads, allowed, for, faster, and, more, convenient, cargo, transportation, development, on, an, immense, scale, occurred, during, this, period, anticipating, similar, advancements, in, european, countries, in, 1850, there, were, fifty, factories, with, a, total, capital, of, rs, 7, 000, 000, 000, at, the, end, of, the, imperial, period, in, 1889, brazil, had, 636, factories, representing, an, annual, rate, of, increase, of, 6, 74, over, the, number, in, 1850, and, with, a, total, capital, of, approximately, rs, 401, 630, 600, 000, which, represents, an, annual, growth, rate, in, value, of, 10, 94, from, 1850, to, 1889, the, countryside, echoed, with, the, clang, of, iron, track, being, laid, as, railroads, were, constructed, at, the, most, furious, pace, of, the, 19th, century, indeed, building, in, 1880s, was, the, second, greatest, in, absolute, terms, in, brazil, s, entire, history, only, eight, countries, in, the, entire, world, laid, more, track, in, the, decade, than, brazil, the, first, railroad, line, with, only, 15, kilometres, 9, 3, mi, of, track, was, opened, on, 30, april, 1854, at, a, time, when, some, european, countries, still, had, no, rail, service, by, 1868, there, were, 718, kilometres, 446, mi, of, railroad, lines, and, by, the, end, of, the, empire, in, 1889, this, had, grown, to, 9, 200, kilometres, 5, 700, mi, with, another, 9, 000, kilometres, 5, 600, mi, under, construction, making, it, the, country, with, the, largest, rail, network, in, latin, america, factories, were, constructed, throughout, the, empire, in, the, 1880s, allowing, brazil, s, cities, to, be, modernized, and, receive, the, benefits, of, gas, electrical, sanitation, telegraph, and, tram, companies, brazil, was, entering, the, modern, world, it, was, the, fifth, country, in, the, world, to, install, modern, city, sewers, the, third, to, have, sewage, treatment, and, one, of, the, pioneers, in, the, installation, of, a, telephone, service, in, addition, to, the, foregoing, improvements, to, infrastructure, it, was, also, the, first, south, american, nation, to, adopt, public, electric, lighting, in, 1883, and, the, second, in, the, americas, behind, the, united, states, to, establish, a, transatlantic, telegraphic, line, connecting, it, directly, to, europe, in, 1874, the, first, domestic, telegraph, line, appeared, during, 1852, in, rio, de, janeiro, by, 1889, there, were, 18, 925, kilometres, 11, 759, mi, of, telegraph, lines, connecting, the, country, s, capital, to, distant, brazilian, provinces, such, as, par, and, even, linking, to, other, south, american, countries, such, as, argentina, and, uruguay, since, the, second, half, of, the, 18th, century, when, brazil, was, still, a, colony, the, government, had, attempted, to, gather, data, regarding, the, population, however, few, captaincies, later, called, provinces, collected, the, requested, information, after, independence, the, government, instituted, a, commission, for, statistics, in, an, 1829, decree, with, a, mandate, to, hold, a, national, census, the, commission, was, a, failure, and, was, disbanded, in, 1834, in, the, ensuing, years, provincial, governments, were, tasked, with, collecting, census, information, but, their, census, reports, were, often, incomplete, or, not, submitted, at, all, in, 1851, another, attempt, at, a, nationwide, census, failed, when, rioting, broke, out, this, was, the, result, of, the, erroneous, belief, among, brazilians, of, mixed, race, descent, that, the, survey, was, a, subterfuge, designed, to, enslave, anyone, having, african, blood, estimated, population, of, brazil, in, the, 1868, the, first, true, national, census, with, exhaustive, and, broad, coverage, was, carried, out, in, 1872, the, small, number, of, people, and, small, number, of, towns, reported, by, the, census, reveal, brazil, s, enormous, territory, to, have, been, sparsely, populated, it, showed, brazil, as, having, a, total, population, of, 9, 930, 478, inhabitants, estimates, made, by, the, government, in, prior, decades, showed, 4, 000, 000, inhabitants, in, 1823, and, gave, a, figure, of, 7, 000, 700, in, 1854, the, population, was, distributed, across, 20, provinces, and, the, neutral, municipality, the, empire, s, capital, with, 641,

national, census, was, held, in, 1890, when, the, brazilian, republic, was, only, a, few, months, old, its, results, showed, that, the, population, had, grown, to, 14, 333, 915, inhabitants, since, the, 1872, census, four, ethnic, groups, were, recognized, in, imperial, brazil, white, black, indian, and, brown, brown, portuguese, pardo, was, a, designation, for, multiracial, brazilians, which, is, still, officially, used, though, some, scholars, prefer, the, term, mixed, one, portuguese, mesti, o, the, term, denotes, a, broad, category, which, includes, caboclos, descendants, of, whites, and, indians, mulattoes, descendants, of, whites, and, blacks, and, cafuzos, descendants, of, blacks, and, indians, the, caboclos, formed, the, majority, of, the, population, in, the, northern, northeastern, and, central, western, regions, a, large, mulatto, population, inhabited, the, eastern, coast, of, the, northeastern, region, from, bahia, to, para, ba, and, were, also, present, in, northern, maranh, o, southern, minas, gerais, eastern, rio, de, janeiro, and, in, esp, rito, santo, the, cafuzos, were, the, smallest, and, most, difficult, to, distinguish, from, the, two, other, mixed, race, subgroups, since, the, descendants, of, caboclos, and, mulattoes, also, fell, into, this, category, and, were, found, in, the, northeast, sert, o, hinterland, these, groups, may, still, be, found, in, the, same, areas, today, white, brazilians, descended, from, the, original, portuguese, settlers, from, the, 1870s, onwards, this, ethnic, group, also, included, other, european, immigrants, mainly, italians, and, germans, although, whites, could, be, found, throughout, the, country, they, were, the, majority, group, in, the, southern, region, and, in, s, o, paulo, province, whites, also, comprised, a, significant, proportion, 40, of, the, population, in, the, northeastern, provinces, of, cear, para, ba, and, rio, grande, do, norte, afro, brazilians, inhabited, the, same, areas, as, mulattoes, the, majority, of, the, population, of, rio, de, janeiro, minas, gerais, esp, rito, santo, bahia, sergipe, alagoas, and, pernambuco, provinces, the, last, four, having, the, smallest, percentages, of, whites, in, the, whole, country, less, than, 30, in, each, were, black, or, brown, the, indians, or, the, indigenous, peoples, of, brazil, were, found, mainly, in, piau, maranh, o, par, and, amazonas, because, of, the, existence, of, distinct, racial, and, cultural, communities, 19th, century, brazil, developed, as, a, multi, ethnic, nation, however, there, is, no, reliable, information, available, for, the, years, prior, to, 1872, the, first, official, national, census, was, compiled, by, the, government, in, 1872, showing, that, out, of, 9, 930, 479, inhabitants, there, were, 38, 1, whites, 38, 3, browns, 19, 7, blacks, and, 3, 9, indians, the, second, official, national, census, in, 1890, revealed, that, in, a, population, of, 14, 333, 915, 44, were, whites, 32, 4, browns, 14, 6, blacks, and, 9, indians, prior, to, 1808, the, portuguese, were, the, only, european, people, to, settle, brazil, in, significant, numbers, although, italians, british, germans, and, spanish, had, previously, immigrated, to, brazil, they, had, only, done, so, as, a, small, number, of, individuals, or, in, very, small, groups, these, earliest, non, portuguese, settlers, did, not, have, a, significant, impact, on, the, culture, of, portugal, s, brazilian, colony, the, situation, changed, after, 1808, when, king, john, vi, began, to, encourage, immigration, from, european, countries, outside, portugal, the, first, to, arrive, in, numbers, were, the, swiss, of, whom, some, 2, 000, settled, in, rio, de, janeiro, province, the, southeast, during, 1818, they, were, followed, by, germans, and, irish, who, immigrated, to, brazil, in, the, 1820s, german, settlers, gravitated, mostly, to, the, southern, provinces, where, the, environment, was, more, like, their, homeland, in, the, 1830s, due, to, the, instability, of, the, regency, european, immigration, ground, to, a, halt, only, recovering, after, pedro, ii, took, the, reins, of, government, and, the, country, entered, a, period, of, peace, and, prosperity, farmers, in, the, southeast, enriched, by, lucrative, coffee, exports, created, the, partnership, system, a, form, of, indentured, servitude, to, attract, immigrants, the, scheme, endured, until, the, end, of, the, 1850s, when, the, system, collapsed, and, was, abandoned, the, failure, was, rooted, in, the, large, debts, european, settlers, incurred, to, subsidize, their, travel, and, settlement, expenses, leaving, them, as, virtual, slaves, to, their, employers, immigration, suffered, another, decline, during, the, paraguayan, war, which, lasted, from, 1864, to, 1870, immigrant, numbers, soared, during, the, 1870s, in, what, came, to, be, called, the, great, immigration, up, to, that, point, around, 10, 000, europeans, arrived, in, brazil, annually, but, after, 1872, their, numbers, increased, dramatically, it, is, estimated, by, the, brazilian, institute, of, geography, and, statistics, that, 500, 000, europeans, immigrated, to, brazil, between, 1808, and, 1883, the, figure, for, european, settlers, arriving, between, 1884, and, 1893, climbed, to, 883, 668, the, number, of, europeans, immigrating, continued, to, rise, in, the, following, decades, with, 862, 100, between, 1894, and, 1903, and, 1, 006, 617, between, 1904, and, 1913, from, 1872, until, 1879, the, nationalities, forming, the, bulk, of, the, new, settlers, were, composed, of, portuguese, 31, 2, italians, 25, 8, germans, 8, 1, and, spanish, 1, 9, in, the, 1880s, italians, would, surpass, the, portuguese, 61, 8, to, 23, 3, respectively, and, the, spanish, would, displace, the, germans, 6, 7, to, 4, 2, respectively, other, smaller, groups, also, arrived, including, russians, poles, and, hungarians, since, nearly, all, european, immigrants, settled, in, the, southeastern, and, southern, areas, of, the, empire, ethnic, distribution, already, unequal, before, the, mass, immigration, became, even, more, divergent, between, regions, for, a, nation, that, had, a, small, widely, scattered, population, 4, 000, 000, in, 1823, and, 14, 333, 915, in, 1890, the, immigration, of, more, than, 1, 380, 000, europeans, had, a, tremendous, effect, upon, the, country, s, ethnic, composition, in, 1872, the, year, of, the, first, reliable, national, census, white, brazilians, represented, just, over, a, third, 38, 1, of, the, total, population, in, 1890, they, had, increased, to, a, little, under, half, 44, 0, of, all, brazilians, in, 1823, a, year, after, independence, slaves, made, up, 29, of, the, population, of, brazil, a, figure, which, fell, throughout, the, lifetime, of, the, empire, from, 24, in, 1854, to, 15, 2, in, 1872, and, finally, to, less, than, 5, in, 1887, the, year, before, slavery, was, completely, abolished, slaves, were, mostly, adult, males, from, southwestern, africa, slaves, brought, to, brazil, differed, ethnically, religiously, and, linguistically, each, identifying, primarily, with, his, or, her, own, nation, of, origin, rather, than, by, a, shared, african, ethnicity, some, of, the, slaves, brought, to, the, americas, had, been, captured, while, fighting, intertribal, wars, in, africa, and, had, then, been, sold, to, slave, dealers, slaves, and, their, descendants, were, usually, found, in, regions, devoted, to, producing, exports, for, foreign, markets, sugarcane, plantations, on, the, eastern, coast, of, the, northeast, region, during, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, are, typical, of, economic, activities, dependent, on, slave, labor, in, northern, maranh, o, province, slave, labor, was, used, in, cotton, and, rice, production, in, the, 18th, century, in, this, period, slaves, were, also, exploited, in, minas, gerais, province, where, gold, was, extracted, slavery, was, also, common, in, rio, de, janeiro, and, s, o, paulo, during, the, 19th, century, for, the, cultivation, of, coffee, which, became, vital, to, the, national, economy, the, prevalence, of, slavery, was, not, geographically, uniform, across, brazil, around, 1870, only, five, provinces, rio, de, janeiro, with, 30, bahia, with, 15, minas, gerais, with, 14, s, o, paulo, with, 7, and, rio, grande, do, sul, also, with, 7, held, 73, of, the, nation, s, total, slave, population, these, were, followed, by, pernambuco, with, 6, and, alagoas, with, 4, among, the, remaining, 13, provinces, none, individually, had, even, 3, most, slaves, worked, as, plantation, laborers, relatively, few, brazilians, owned, slaves, and, most, small, and, medium, sized, farms, employed, free, workers, slaves, could, be, found, scattered, throughout, society, in, other, capacities, some, were, used, as, house, servants, farmers, miners, prostitutes, gardeners, and, in, many, other, roles, many, emancipated, slaves, went, on, to, acquire, slaves, and, there, were, even, cases, of, slaves, who, had, their, own, slaves, while, slaves, were, usually, black, or, mulatto, there, were, reported, cases, of, slaves, who, appeared, to, be, of, european, descent, the, product, of, generations, of, inter, ethnic, sexual, relations, between, male, slave, owners, and,

clerics, moved, closer, to, the, pope, and, his, doctrines, this, resulted, in, the, religious, issue, a, series, of, clashes, during, the, 1870s, between, the, clergy, and, the, government, since, the, former, wanted, a, more, direct, relationship, with, rome, and, the, latter, sought, to, maintain, its, oversight, of, church, affairs, the, constitution, did, allow, followers, of, other, non, catholic, faiths, to, practice, their, religious, beliefs, albeit, only, in, private, the, construction, of, non, catholic, places, of, worship, was, officially, forbidden, from, the, outset, these,

subject, of, christian, mission, activities, some, africans, and, their, descendants, however, held, onto, elements, of, polytheistic, religious, traditions, by, merging, them, with, catholicism, this, resulted, in, the, creation, of, syncretic, creeds, such, as, candombl, islam, was, also, practiced, among, a, small, minority, of, african, slaves, although, it, was, harshly, repressed, and, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, had, been, completely, extinguished, by, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, the, indians, in, most, of, eastern, brazil, had, been, either, assimilated, or,

importance, the, previously, dominant, old, baroque, style, was, superseded, by, neoclassicism, new, developments, appeared, such, as, the, use, of, iron, in, architecture, and, the, appearance, of, lithography, and, photography, which, revitalized, the, visual, arts, the, government, s, creation, of, the, imperial, academy, of, fine, arts, in, the, 1820s, played, a, pivotal, role, in, influencing, and, expanding, the, visual, arts, in, brazil, mainly, by, educating, generations, of, artists, but, also, by, serving, as, a, stylistic, guideline, the, academy, s, origins, lay, in, the, foundation, of, the, escola, real, das, ci, ncias, artes, e, of, cios, royal, school, of, the, sciences, arts, and, crafts, in, 1816, by, the, portuguese, king, john, vi, its, members, of, whom, the, most, famous, was, jean, baptiste, debret, were, french, migr, es, who, worked, as, painters, sculptors, musicians, and, engineers, the, school, s, main, goal, was, to, encourage, french, aesthetics, and, the, neoclassical, style, to, replace, the, prevalent, baroque, style, plagued, by, a, lack, of, funds, since, its, inception, the, school, was, later, renamed, as, the, academy, of, fine, arts, in, 1820, and, in, 1824, received, its, final, name, under, the, empire, imperial, academy, of, fine, arts, it, was, only, following, pedro, ii, s, majority, in, 1840, however, that, the, academy, became, a, powerhouse, part, of, the, emperor, s, greater, scheme, of, fomenting, a, national, culture, and, consequently, uniting, all, brazilians, in, a, common, sense, of, nationhood, pedro, ii, would, sponsor, the, brazilian, culture, through, several, public, institutions, funded, by, the, government, not, restricted, to, the, academy, of, fine, arts, such, as, brazilian, historic, and, geographic, institute, and, imperial, academy, of, music, and, national, opera, that, sponsorship, would, pave, the, way, not, only, for, the, careers, of, artists, but, also, for, those, engaged, in, other, fields, including, historians, such, as, francisco, adolfo, de, varnhagen, and, musicians, such, as, the, operatic, composer, ant, nio, carlos, gomes, by, the, 1840s, romanticism, had, largely, supplanted, neoclassicism, not, only, in, painting, but, also, in, sculpture, and, architecture, the, academy, did, not, resume, its, role, of, simply, providing, education, prizes, medals, scholarships, in, foreign, countries, and, funding, were, used, as, incentives, among, its, staff, and, students, were, some, of, the, most, renowned, brazilian, artists, including,

on, european, works, even, if, not, performed, by, foreign, actors, romanticism, at, that, time, was, regarded, as, the, literary, style, that, best, fitted, brazilian, literature, which, could, reveal, its, uniqueness, when, compared, to, foreign, literature, during, the, 1830s, and, 1840s, a, network, of, newspapers, journals, book, publishers, and, printing, houses, emerged, which, together, with, the, opening, of, theaters, in, the, major, towns, brought, into, being, what, could, be, termed, but, for, the, narrowness, of, its, scope, a, national, culture, romanticism, reached, its, apogee, between, the, late, 1850s, and, the, early, 1870s, as, it, divided, into, several, branches, including, indianism, and, sentimentalism, the, most, influential, literary, style, in, 19th,

the, most, famous, romanticist, playwrights, were, martins, pena, and, joaquim, manuel, de, macedo, brazilian, romanticism, did, not, have, the, same, success, in, theater, as, it, had, in, literature, as, most, of, the, plays, were, either, neoclassic, tragedies, or, romantic, works, from, portugal, or, translations, from, italian, french, or, spanish, after, the, opening, of, the, brazilian, dramatic, conservatory, in, 1845, the, government, gave, financial, aid, to, national, theater, companies, in, exchange, for, staging, plays, in, portuguese, by, the, 1880s, romanticism,
