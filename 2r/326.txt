other, non, professional, troops, which, were, replaced, with, taxes, to, support, the, professional, troops, often, saqaliba, or, maghrebis, and, freed, c, rdoban, subjects, from, military, service, almanzor, expanded, recruitment, of, the, saqaliba, and, berbers, he, also, created, new, units, outside, the, regular, army, of, the, caliphate, that, were, loyal, to, him, and, served, to, control, the, capital, almanzor, abolished, the, system, of, tribal, units, with, their, own, commanders, this, system, had, been, in, decline, due, to, a, lack, of, arab, recruits, and, the, pseudo, feudalistic, institutions, on, the, frontiers, a, new, system, of, mixed, units, without, clear, loyalty, under, orders, from, administration, officials, replaced, it, the, increase, in, military,

the, infantry, to, sieges, and, fortress, garrisons, this, reform, led, to, entire, tribes, particularly, berber, riders, being, moved, to, the, peninsula, at, that, time, al, andalus, was, known, as, dar, jihad, or, country, of, jihad, it, attracted, many, zealous, volunteers, who, made, up, a, small, but, important, portion, of, the, total, army, almanzor, s, personal, guard, was, made, up, of, christian, mercenaries, who, also, participated, in, his, campaigns, in, christian, territories, contemporary, figures, on, the, size, of, the, army, are, contradictory, some, accounts, claim, that, their, armies, numbered, two, hundred, thousand, horsemen, and, six, hundred, thousand, foot, soldiers, while, others, talk, about, twelve, thousand, horsemen, three, thousand, mounted, berbers, and, two, thousand, s, d, n, african, light, infantry, christian, chroniclers, record, that, ordinarily, the, saracen, armies, amount, to, 30, 40, 50, or, 60, 000, men, even, when, in, serious, occasions,

troops, while, during, the, eighth, century, the, trans, pyrenean, expeditions, totaled, ten, thousand, men, and, those, carried, out, against, christians, in, the, north, of, the, peninsula, were,

and, 1, 300, shields, and, 3, 000, campaign, stores, annually, in, contrast, to, the, role, the, navy, played, under, abd, al, rahman, iii, under, almanzor, it, served, as, a, means, of, transporting, ground, troops, such, as, between, the, maghreb, and, the, iberian, peninsula, this, was, also, seen, with, alc, cer, do, sal, s, ships, in, the, campaign, against, santiago, de, compostela, in, 997,

without, power, or, influence, almanzor, s, temporal, power, increased, the, importance, of, the, military, both, as, a, symbol, of, the, power, of, almanzor, and, an, instrument, to, guarantee, the, payment, of, taxes, the, chamberlain, s, court, also, rivaled, that, of, the, caliph, almanzor, s, reforms, also, divided, the, population, into, two, unequal, groups, a, large, mass, of, civilian,

andalus, in, the, long, term, these, were, to, comprise, the, two, major, aspects, of, andalusi, identity, and, eventually, characterized, most, of, the, population, the, population, of, the, capital, city, c, rdoba, most, likely, surpassed, 100, 000, in, the, 10th, century, making, it, the, largest, city, in, europe, alongside, constantinople, tertius, chandler, estimated, that, circa, 1000, ce, c, rdoba, held, around, 450, 000, people, around, the, same, year, the, caliphate, occupied, four, hundred, thousand, square, kilometers, and, was, populated, by, around, three, million, people, the, iberian, christian, states, comprised, 160, 000, square, kilometers, and, 500, 000, people, by, comparison, at, the, time, of, the, muslim, invasion, iberia, had, an, estimated, four, million, inhabitants, other, historians, estimate, higher, at, around, seven, or, eight, million, colmeiro, estimated, in, a, pre, industrial, society, for, every, million, inhabitants, ten, thousand, soldiers, could, be, mustered, even, assuming, the, chronicles, exaggerated, tenfold, the, real, numbers, these, speak, of, eight, hundred, thousand, soldiers, the, caliphate, could, have, had, eight, million, inhabitants, those, who, use, more, bullish, criteria, estimate, between, seven, and, 10, million, under, almanzor, the, realm, also, had, other, large, cities, like, toledo, almer, a, and, granada, which, were, all, around, 30, 000, and, zaragoza, valencia, and, m, laga, all, above, 15, 000, this, contrasted, sharply, with, the, christian, north, of, the, peninsula, which, lacked, large, urban, centers, the, adoption, of, the, arabic, language, was, a, wide, reaching, phenomenon, of, long, term, importance, it, was, spearheaded, by, the, promotion, of, classical, arabic, as, an, administrative, and, literary, language, followed, by, the, development, of, a, native, vernacular, andalusi, arabic, in, the, 9th, century, romance, languages, continued, to, be, spoken, in, rural, lower, classes, but, arabic, had, become, the, language, of, the, middle, and, upper, classes, by, the, end, of, the, century, even, the, christian, population, was, so, widely, arabized, that, their, clergy, were, required, to, translate, religious, texts, into, arabic, the, early, population, of, al, andalus, at, the, outset, of, umayyad, rule, had, several, main, constituents, arabs, berbers, indigenous, converts, to, islam, indigenous, christians, and, jews, the, andalusis, of, arab, origin, were, a, minority, but, they, had, formed, the, ruling, elites, since, the, muslim, conquest, in, the, early, 8th, century, berbers, who, had, made, up, the, majority, of, the, conquering, army, were, a, larger, group, relatively, powerful, but, less, so, than, the, arab, elites, the, indigenous, population, were, the, majority, but, the, proportion, of, christians, among, them, decreased, over, time, as, many, of, them, converted, to, islam, the, indigenous, muslim, converts, were, known, as, muwallad, s, arabic, and, became, very, numerous, in, later, generations, some, of, them, were, descended, from, the, former, visigothic, and, hispano, roman, landholding, elites, that, existed, prior, to, the, muslim, conquest, and, who, had, retained, much, of, their, status, after, the, conquest, jews, were, present, in, smaller, numbers, relative, to, the, other, groups, according, to, thomas, glick, despite, the, withdrawal, of, substantial, numbers, during, the, drought, and, famine, of, the, 750s, fresh, berber, migration, from, north, africa, was, a, constant, feature, of, andalusi, history, increasing, in, tempo, in, the, tenth, century, hispano, romans, who, converted, to, islam, numbering, six, or, seven, millions, comprised, the, majority, of, the, population, and, also, occupied, the, lowest, rungs, on, the, social, ladder, while, the, indigenous, jews, christians, and, muwallad, s, were, largely, organized, into, family, based, social, structures, the, arabs, and, berbers, were, organized, into, a, more, complex, mix, of, family, and, tribe, loyalties, arab, identity, in, general, was, largely, tied, to, the, assertion, of, arab, ancestry, this, lineage, was, perceived, as, inherited, through, the, father, meaning, that, children, of, arab, men, and, non, arab, women, were, still, considered, arabs, although, the, lineage, of, the, mother, if, she, came, from, another, noble, or, elite, background, could, still, be, seen, as, prestigious, beyond, the, heartland, of, cordoba, the, makeup, of, the, population, varied, depending, on, the, region, the, northern, limit, of, muslim, settlement, generally, extended, along, a, frontier, that, ran, to, the, north, of, the, tagus, river, in, the, west, around, the, cordillera, central, in, the, center, and, before, the, foothills, of, the, pyrenees, in, the, east, the, region, along, the, western, frontier, known, as, the, lower, march, and, including, the, modern, day, province, of, extremadura, was, largely, rural, with, the, exception, of, the, city, of, m, rida, ethnic, arabs, were, at, least, during, the, early, emirate, period, sparse, here, and, the, muslim, population, consisted, mostly, of, berbers, probably, semi, nomadic, or, transhumant, and, of, muwallad, s, the, region, along, the, central, frontier, near, toledo, also, known, as, the, middle, march, was, again, only, sparsely, inhabited, by, arabs, the, city, and, local, politics, were, dominated, by, muwallad, s, while, the, rural, highlands, were, generally, the, domain, of, berber, tribes, to, the, northeast, the, upper, march, centered, around, zaragoza, and, the, ebro, river, valley, contained, more, cities, and, a, more, diverse, population, including, arabs, berbers, and, muwallad, s, among, the, latter, were, powerful, families, who, dominated, the, area, s, politics, throughout, the, islamic, period, the, hills, and, mountains, to, the, north, were, generally, still, inhabited, by, christians, in, matters, of, islamic, religion, the, ulama, religious, scholars, and, the, fuqaha, judges, played, the, most, important, social, role, in, the, 9th, century, both, the, maliki, and, the, hanafi, legal, schools, of, thought, maddhab, s, were, common, but, the, umayyads, themselves, promoted, the, former, one, reason, for, this, might, be, that, hanafism, was, seen, as, too, closely, associated, with, the, abbasids, whom, the, umayyads, considered, enemies, maliki, dominance, solidified, under, the, reign, of, abd, ar, rahman, ii, in, the, 9th, century, though, during, the, reign, of, his, son, muhammad, i, the, shafi, i, and, zahiri, schools, were, also, introduced, malikism, eventually, became, another, core, characteristic, of, andalusi, identity, and, its, spread, contributed, to, the, islamization, of, the, country, as, elsewhere, in, the, historic, islamic, world, jews, and, christians, were, considered, by, muslims, to, be, people, of, the, book, who, took, on, the, status, of, dhimmi, s, or, protected, non, muslims, in, exchange, for, the, state, s, protection, they, were, required, to, pay, a, tax, called, the, jizya, their, religious, practices, were, tolerated, but, conspicuous, displays, of, faith, such, as, bells, and, processions, were, discouraged, the, local, christian, catholic, church, in, al, andalus, was, partially, integrated, with, the, umayyad, regime, and, its, leaders, collaborated, with, the, arab, muslim, elites, bishops, often, acted, as, administrators, and, political, envoys, and, their, appointment, was, overseen, by, the, umayyad, state, 353, while, the, catholic, church, retained, its, internal, unity, the, advent, of, islamic, rule, weakened, its, monopoly, on, religious, authority, over, the, christian, communities, in, al, andalus, resulting, in, many, deviations, from, orthodox, practice, and, the, emergence, of, both, old, and, new, heterodoxies, which, co, existed, alongside, official, church, doctrine, 353, 357, the, arabized, christians, of, the, iberian, peninsula, were, later, referred, to, as, mozarabs, from, arabic, must, arab, arabic, lit, arabized, the, term, mozarab, has, been, used, by, historians, in, various, ways, since, the, 19th, century, and, can, refer, to, either, the, christian, population, living, under, muslim, rule, who, did, not, call, themselves, by, this, name, or, to, the, arabized, christians, that, emigrated, from, al, andalus, to, the, christian, kingdoms, in, northern, iberia, the, term, mozarabic, is, also, used, to, refer, to, the, andalusi, dialect, of, romance, that, was, spoken, by, christians, in, al, andalus, to, the, mozarabic, liturgy, that, was, a, continuation, of, the, visigothic, rite, and, to, mozarabic, art, and, architecture, a, fusion, of, christian, and, islamic, artistic, styles, brought, by, christian, emigrants, from, al, andalus, to, northern, iberia, while, christians, saw, their, status, decline, from, their, rule, under, the, visigoths, the, status, of, jews, improved, while, jews, were, persecuted, under, the, visigoths, jewish, communities, benefited, from, umayyad, rule, by, obtaining, more, freedom, affluence, and, a, higher, social, standing, not, much, is, known, about, the, jewish, communities, in, al, andalus, before, the, 10th, century, though, they, must, have, been, an, important, presence, historical, records, attest, that, they, were, present, in, c, rdoba, in, the, 9th, century, 215, during, the, caliphal, period, some, jews, entered, into, the, circles, of, the, caliph, s, court, of, whom, the, most, influential, was, hasdai, ibn, shaprut, the, muslim, proportion, of, al, andalus, s, population, grew, during, umayyad, rule, as, native, iberians, converted, to, islam, as, in, many, other, lands, in, the, early, islamic, era, conversion, to, islam, was, likely, motivated, primarily, by, social, and, economic, considerations, as, the, number, of, converts, grew, the, reasons, to, convert, likely, became, stronger, and, the, process, became, self, reinforcing, indigenous, elites, had, been, among, the, first, to, convert, as, a, way, to, preserve, their, status, as, christian, institutions, weakened, and, the, islamic, presence, became, clearly, more, permanent, a, steady, drift, towards, islam, likely, took, place, in, the, rest, of, the, christian, population, seeking, improved, social, status, and, economic, opportunities, historical, sources, provide, little, data, on, which, to, estimate, the, rate, of, conversion, but, a, study, by, richard, bulliet, has, put, forward, a, possible, model, of, this, process, it, suggests, that, by, the, beginning, of, the, 9th, century, only, some, 8, of, the, indigenous, population, had, converted, but, that, the, curve, of, conversion, increased, in, the, second, half, of, the, 9th, century, resulting, in, about, 25, conversion, around, the, year, 900, roughly, 50, towards, 950, and, around, 75, by, 1000, after, which, conversion, slowed, half, of, the, population, in, c, rdoba, is, reported, to, have, been, muslim, by, the, 10th, century, with, an, increase, to, 70, percent, by, the, 11th, century, though, this, was, due, less, to, local, conversion, than, to, muslim, immigration, from, the, rest, of, the, iberian, peninsula, and, north, africa, the, elite, political, and, social, circles, that, formed, around, the, umayyads, in, c, rdoba, were, known, as, the, kh, a, arabic, they, were, largely, arab, though, they, were, also, joined, by, individuals, of, non, arab, origin, who, climbed, through, the, political, ranks, among, the, latter, were, various, maw, l, sing, mawl, or, clients, sponsored, by, powerful, families, these, were, often, muslim, converts, and, unlike, its, connotations, in, the, middle, east, the, term, mawl, in, al, andalus, typically, implied, an, elite, status, 192, some, powerful, berber, leaders, and, scholars, were, also, able, to, join, the, ranks, of, the, political, elites, 195, slavery, was, also, a, regular, feature, of, andalusi, society, and, al, andalus, was, a, center, of, the, slave, trade, in, the, western, mediterranean, particularly, in, the, 10th, century, when, the, caliphate, played, a, major, role, in, international, trade, merchants, of, many, backgrounds, jewish, muslim, and, christian, participated, in, this, trade, 242, 231, historical, sources, attest, that, slaves, were, commonly, employed, in, wealthy, households, and, especially, at, the, royal, court, but, little, is, known, of, what, role, they, may, have, played, in, industries, such, as, agriculture, and, mining, 242, most, slaves, of, this, period, were, captured, during, muslim, raids, on, the, christian, kingdoms, in, the, northern, iberian, peninsula, or, were, imported, from, other, european, markets, these, european, slaves, were, known, as, aq, liba, arabic, and, were, highly, valued, 242, 243, some, were, castrated, and, sold, as, eunuchs, considered, a, very, prized, commodity, the, latter, were, an, integral, part, of, umayyad, palace, society, and, played, an, important, role, in, courtly, politics, including, in, the, matter, of, dynastic, succession, where, they, often, allied, with, the, women, whose, sons, were, potential, candidates, for, the, throne, 242, 243, all, the, mothers, of, umayyad, emirs, and, caliphs, were, also, originally, slaves, in, the, context, of, elite, society, slave, origins, held, no, social, stigma, and, women, could, become, very, powerful, in, the, household, and, the, court, slave, girls, that, were, considered, particularly, prized, or, gifted, were, usually, given, an, extensive, education, in, arts, and, literature, as, was, also, common, in, the, court, of, the, abbasid, caliphs, 230, black, african, slaves, known, as, ab, d, were, also, purchased, and, imported, to, al, andalus, but, they, were, less, numerous, than, the, aq, liba, and, mostly, trained, to, serve, as, military, troops, the, economy, of, al, andalus, had, been, monetized, by, the, end, of, the, 8th, century, but, it, wasn, t, until, the, 10th, century, that, both, gold, and, silver, coins, were, minted, thanks, in, large, part, to, the, flow, of, gold, from, trans, saharan, trade, a, new, mint, was, established, at, madinat, al, zahra, circa, 947, ce, 336, ah, though, it, was, moved, back, to, c, rdoba, circa, 975, 976, ce, 365, ah, the, state, also, benefited, greatly, from, trade, with, the, rest, of, the, islamic, world, to, the, east, in, addition, to, exporting, crafted, goods, primarily, silk, cloth, it, provided, raw, materials, to, north, africa, and, the, middle, east, regions, that, were, poorer, in, natural, resources, than, al, andalus, this, trade, advantage, promoted, a, higher, standard, of, living, which, in, turn, attracted, more, skilled, labour, to, the, country, c, rdoba, also, drew, revenues, from, tributes, collected, from, the, christian, kingdoms, to, the, north, which, provided, silver, and, slaves, one, historical, source, reports, that, the, state, s, total, revenues, at, the, end, of, abd, al, rahman, iii, s, reign, amounted, to, six, and, a, half, million, dinars, though, it, s, unclear, what, this, figure, means, precisely, in, terms, of, purchasing, power, some, of, the, most, prominent, merchants, of, the, caliphate, were, jews, jewish, merchants, had, extensive, networks, of, trade, that, stretched, the, length, of, the, mediterranean, sea, since, there, was, no, international, banking, system, at, the, time, payments, relied, on, a, high, level, of, trust, and, this, level, of, trust, could, only, be, cemented, through, personal, or, family, bonds, such, as, marriage, jews, from, al, andalus, cairo, and, the, levant, all, intermarried, across, borders, therefore, jewish, merchants, in, the, caliphate, had, counterparts, abroad, that, were, willing, to, do, business, with, them, the, agricultural, revolution, that, occurred, in, al, andalus, following, the, arrival, of, the, arabs, and, berbers, was, of, major, importance, to, both, society, and, the, economy, the, combination, of, new, crops, including, rice, hard, wheat, bananas, watermelons, oranges, and, more, and, new, and, more, widespread, irrigation, techniques, including, the, use, of, norias, a, type, of, waterwheel, meant, that, agricultural, output, was, greater, more, consistent, and, took, place, during, a, longer, part, of, the, year, this, ensured, that, the, population, was, healthier, and, less, vulnerable, to, famine, encouraging, demographic, growth, while, farmers, reaped, higher, incomes, and, were, able, to, further, diversify, their, production, some, crops, such, as, figs, were, cultivated, as, cash, crops, in, high, society, both, men, and, women, were, expected, to, learn, adab, a, kind, of, etiquette, common, to, al, andalus, and, other, islamic, societies, at, the, time, women, such, as, royal, concubines, were, sometimes, sent, abroad, to, be, trained, in, adab, and, other, forms, of, culture, al, andalus, was, subject, to, eastern, cultural, influences, with, abd, al, rahman, i, likely, having, an, interest, in, syrian, culture, during, the, reign, of, abd, al, rahman, ii, the, culture, of, baghdad, became, fashionable, and, his, reign, is, considered, a, high, point, of, culture, and, patronage, during, the, emirate, period, the, musician, ziryab, was, a, major, trendsetter, of, his, time, creating, trends, in, fashion, hairstyles, and, hygiene, his, students, took, these, trends, with, them, throughout, europe, and, north, africa, he, also, founded, an, academy, for, arts, music, and, fashion, which, lasted, for, several, generations, the, legacy, of, ziryab, and, figures, like, him, was, continued, into, the, 9th, century, by, bringing, in, new, styles, of, art, music, and, literature, from, the, eastern, islamic, world, c, rdoba, was, the, cultural, and, intellectual, centre, of, al, andalus, with, translations, of, ancient, greek, texts, into, arabic, latin, and, hebrew, the, emir, abd, al, rahman, ii, sent, emissaries, to, the, abbasid, and, byzantine, courts, to, bring, back, books, on, subjects, such, as, islamic, religious, scholarship, arabic, grammar, poetry, astrology, medicine, and, other, sciences, abbas, ibn, firnas, was, among, the, most, notable, poets, and, polymaths, of, this, period, who, brought, back, technical, and, scientific, knowledge, back, with, him, from, the, east, in, the, 10th, century, c, rdoba, became, one, of, the, centers, of, culture, and, high, society, in, the, islamic, world, al, andalus, s, prosperity, and, the, caliph, s, patronage, attracted, travelers, diplomats, and, scholars, advances, in, science, history, geography, philosophy, and, language, also, occurred, during, the, caliphate, during, the, reign, of, al, hakam, ii, the, royal, library, possessed, an, estimated, 400, 000, to, 500, 000, volumes, for, comparison, the, abbey, of, saint, gall, in, switzerland, contained, just, over, 100, volumes, poets, sought, the, patronage, of, the, caliph, s, court, as, with, the, example, of, ibn, darraj, al, qastali, who, served, as, court, poet, for, abd, al, rahman, iii, al, hakam, ii, and, almanzor, other, poets, such, as, yusuf, al, ramadi, composed, works, on, nature, and, love, muwashshah, a, form, of, andalusi, vernacular, poetry, combining, vernacular, arabic, and, the, vernacular, romance, language, grew, more, popular, during, this, period, writers, also, began, to, compose, histories, devoted, to, the, umayyad, dynasty, of, al, andalus, such, as, ahmad, al, razi, s, history, of, the, rulers, of, al, andalus, arabic, romanized, akhb, r, mul, k, al, andalus, these, histories, also, provided, information, on, the, land, and, its, people, many, ideas, and, myths, concerning, the, history, of, al, andalus, including, stories, about, its, initial, muslim, conquest, in, the, 8th, century, began, to, appear, in, this, period, christians, and, jews, contributed, to, the, intellectual, and, cultural, spheres, of, al, andalus, although, this, required, that, they, publicly, respect, the, higher, status, of, the, arabic, language, and, of, the, islamic, religion, hasdai, ibn, shaprut, was, one, of, the, most, well, known, jewish, figures, of, this, time, in, addition, to, serving, in, the, caliph, s, court, and, being, highly, versed, in, arabic, culture, hasdai, was, also, a, patron, of, hebrew, scholarship, he, was, determined, to, establish, the, jewish, community, of, al, andalus, as, independent, from, the, jewish, academies, of, baghdad, and, the, middle, east, which, helped, bring, about, the, golden, age, of, jewish, culture, in, the, region, by, contrast, latin, culture, within, al, andalus, declined, as, local, christians, became, increasingly, arabized, the, latin, language, was, retained, in, liturgy, however, andalusi, christians, did, journey, to, and, from, the, christian, controlled, territories, to, the, north, and, in, the, rest, of, europe, contributing, to, the, transmission, of, knowledge, from, al, andalus, to, the, rest, of, europe, some, upper, class, women, also, had, the, resources, to, receive, education, and, participate, in, high, culture,
