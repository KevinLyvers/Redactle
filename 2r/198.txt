the, sarmatians, s, r, m, e, i, n, z, ancient, greek, romanized, sarmatai, latin, sarmatae, were, a, large, confederation, of, ancient, iranian, equestrian, nomadic, peoples, who, dominated, the, pontic, steppe, from, about, the, 3rd, century, bc, to, the, 4th, century, ad, the, earliest, reference, to, the, sarmatians, is, in, the, avesta, sairima, which, is, in, the, later, iranian, sources, recorded, as, sarm, and, salm, originating, in, the, central, parts, of, the, eurasian, steppe, the, sarmatians, were, part, of, the, wider, scythian, cultures, they, started, migrating, westward, around, the, fourth, and, third, centuries, bc, coming, to, dominate, the, closely, related, scythians, by, 200, bc, at, their, greatest, reported, extent, around, 100, bc, these, tribes, ranged, from, the, vistula, river, to, the, mouth, of, the, danube, and, eastward, to, the, volga, bordering, the, shores, of, the, black, and, caspian, seas, as, well, as, the, caucasus, to, the, south, in, the, first, century, ad, the, sarmatians, began, encroaching, upon, the, roman, empire, in, alliance, with, germanic, tribes, in, the, third, century, ad, their, dominance, of, the, pontic, steppe, was, broken, by, the, germanic, goths, with, the, hunnic, invasions, of, the, fourth, century, many, sarmatians, joined, the, goths, and, other, germanic, tribes, vandals, in, the, settlement, of, the, western, roman, empire, since, large, parts, of, today, s, russia, specifically, the, land, between, the, ural, mountains, and, the, don, river, were, controlled, in, the, fifth, century, bc, by, the, sarmatians, the, volga, don, and, ural, steppes, sometimes, are, called, sarmatian, motherland, the, sarmatians, in, the, bosporan, kingdom, assimilated, into, the, greek, civilization, while, others, were, absorbed, by, the, proto, circassian, maeotian, people, the, alans, and, the, goths, other, sarmatians, were, assimilated, and, absorbed, by, the, early, slavs, a, people, related, to, the, sarmatians, known, as, the, alans, survived, in, the, north, caucasus, into, the, early, middle, ages, ultimately, giving, rise, to, the, modern, ossetic, ethnic, group, the, polish, nobility, claims, to, stem, from, the, sarmatians, genomic, studies, suggest, that, this, group, may, have, been, genetically, similar, to, the, eastern, yamnaya, bronze, age, group, the, greek, name, sarmatai, is, derived, from, the, old, iranic, sarmatian, endonym, sarmata, or, sarumata, of, which, another, variant, sa, rumata, gave, rise, to, the, ancient, greek, name, sauromatai, the, form, sarmata, or, sarumata, was, the, main, form, of, the, name, and, initially, coexisted, with, the, form, sa, rumata, until, the, late, 4th, to, early, 3rd, centuries, bc, when, sarmata, sarumata, became, the, only, variant, of, the, name, in, use, this, name, meant, armed, with, throwing, darts, and, arrows, and, is, cognate, with, the, indic, sanskrit, term, rumant, which, makes, it, semantically, similar, to, the, endonym, of, the, scythians, sku, at, meaning, archers, the, later, middle, iranic, form, of, sa, rumata, was, s, rmata, or, s, rumata, of, which, the, later, form, s, rmata, or, s, rumata, was, recorded, in, ancient, greek, as, syrmatai, latin, syrmatae, the, territory, inhabited, by, the, sarmatians, which, was, known, as, sarmatia, s, r, m, e, i, to, greco, roman, ethnographers, covered, the, western, part, of, greater, scythia, and, corresponded, to, today, s, central, ukraine, south, eastern, ukraine, southern, russia, russian, volga, and, south, ural, regions, and, to, a, smaller, extent, the, northeastern, balkans, and, around, moldova, the, ethnogenesis, of, the, sarmatians, occurred, during, the, 4th, to, 3rd, centuries, bc, when, nomads, from, central, asia, migrated, into, the, territory, of, the, sauromatians, in, the, southern, ural, mountains, these, nomads, conquered, the, sauromatians, resulting, in, an, increased, incidence, of, eastern, asiatic, features, in, the, early, sarmatians, similar, to, those, of, the, sakas, the, name, sarmatians, eventually, came, to, be, applied, to, the, whole, of, the, new, people, formed, out, of, these, migrations, whose, constituent, tribes, were, the, aorsi, roxolani, alans, and, the, iazyges, despite, the, similarity, between, the, names, sarmatian, and, sauromatian, modern, authors, distinguish, between, the, two, since, sarmatian, culture, did, not, directly, develop, from, the, sauromatian, culture, and, the, core, of, the, sarmatian, culture, was, composed, of, these, newly, arrived, migrants, a, typical, transitional, site, between, these, two, periods, is, found, in, the, filippovka, kurgans, which, are, late, sauromatian, early, sarmatian, and, dated, to, the, 5th, 4th, century, bce, during, the, 4th, and, 3rd, centuries, bc, the, centre, of, sarmatian, power, remained, north, of, the, caucasus, and, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, the, most, important, centres, were, around, the, lower, don, kalmykia, the, kuban, area, and, the, central, caucasus, during, the, end, of, the, 4th, century, bc, the, scythians, the, then, dominant, power, in, the, black, sea, steppe, were, militarily, defeated, by, the, macedonian, kings, philip, ii, of, macedon, and, lysimachus, in, 339, and, 313, bc, respectively, they, experienced, another, military, setback, after, participating, in, the, bosporan, civil, war, in, 309, bc, and, came, under, pressure, from, the, thracian, getae, and, the, celtic, bastarnae, at, the, same, time, in, central, asia, following, the, macedonian, conquest, of, the, achaemenid, empire, the, new, seleucid, empire, started, attacking, the, sak, and, dah, nomads, who, lived, to, the, north, of, its, borders, who, in, turn, put, westward, pressure, on, the, sarmatians, pressured, by, the, sak, and, dah, in, the, east, and, taking, advantage, of, the, decline, of, scythian, power, the, sarmatians, began, crossing, the, don, river, and, invaded, scythia, and, also, migrated, south, into, the, north, caucasus, the, first, wave, of, westward, sarmatian, migration, happened, during, the, 2nd, century, bc, and, involved, the, royal, sarmatians, or, saioi, from, scytho, sarmatian, x, aya, meaning, kings, who, moved, into, the, pontic, steppe, and, the, iazyges, also, called, the, iaxamatai, or, iazamatai, who, initially, settled, between, the, don, and, dnieper, rivers, the, roxolani, who, might, have, been, a, mixed, scytho, sarmatian, tribe, followed, the, iazyges, and, occupied, the, black, sea, steppes, up, to, the, dnipro, and, raided, the, crimean, region, during, that, century, at, the, end, of, which, they, were, involved, in, a, conflict, with, the, generals, of, the, pontic, king, mithridates, vi, eupator, in, the, bosporan, chersonesus, while, the, iazyges, became, his, allies, that, the, tribes, formerly, referred, to, by, herodotus, as, scythians, were, now, called, sarmatians, by, hellenistic, and, roman, authors, implies, that, the, sarmatian, conquest, did, not, involve, a, displacement, of, the, scythians, from, the, pontic, steppe, but, rather, that, the, scythian, tribes, were, absorbed, by, the, sarmatians, after, their, conquest, of, scythia, the, sarmatians, became, the, dominant, political, power, in, the, northern, pontic, steppe, where, sarmatian, graves, first, started, appearing, in, the, 2nd, century, bc, meanwhile, the, populations, which, still, identified, as, scythians, proper, became, reduced, to, crimea, and, the, dobruja, region, and, at, one, point, the, crimean, scythians, were, the, vassals, of, the, sarmatian, queen, amage, sarmatian, power, in, the, pontic, steppes, was, also, directed, against, the, greek, cities, on, its, shores, with, the, city, of, pontic, olbia, being, forced, to, pay, repeated, tribute, to, the, royal, sarmatians, and, their, king, saitapharnes, who, is, mentioned, in, the, protogenes, inscription, along, with, the, tribes, of, the, thisamatae, scythians, and, saudaratae, another, sarmatian, king, gatalos, was, named, in, a, peace, treaty, concluded, by, the, king, pharnaces, i, of, pontus, with, his, enemies, two, other, sarmatian, tribes, the, siraces, who, had, previously, originated, in, the, transcaspian, plains, immediately, to, the, northeast, of, hyrcania, before, migrating, to, the, west, and, the, aorsi, moved, to, the, west, across, the, volga, and, into, the, caucasus, mountains, foothills, between, the, 2nd, to, 1st, centuries, bc, from, there, the, pressure, from, their, growing, power, forcing, the, more, western, sarmatian, tribes, to, migrate, further, west, and, the, aorsi, and, siraces, destroyed, the, power, of, the, royal, sarmatians, and, the, iazyges, with, the, aorsi, being, able, to, extend, their, rule, over, a, large, region, stretching, from, the, caucasus, across, the, terek, kuma, lowland, and, kalmykia, in, the, west, up, to, the, aral, sea, region, in, the, east, yet, another, new, sarmatian, group, the, alans, originated, in, central, asia, out, of, the, merger, of, some, old, tribal, groups, with, the, massagetae, related, to, the, asii, who, invaded, bactria, in, the, 2nd, century, bc, the, alans, were, pushed, west, by, the, kangju, people, known, to, graeco, roman, authors, as, the, iaxartai, in, greek, and, the, iaxartae, in, latin, who, were, living, in, the, syr, darya, basin, from, where, they, expanded, their, rule, from, fergana, to, the, aral, sea, region, the, hegemony, of, the, sarmatians, in, the, pontic, steppe, continued, during, the, 1st, century, bc, when, they, were, allied, with, the, scythians, against, diophantus, a, general, of, mithradates, vi, eupator, before, allying, with, mithradates, against, the, romans, and, fighting, for, him, in, both, europe, and, asia, demonstrating, the, sarmatians, complete, involvement, in, the, affairs, of, the, pontic, and, danubian, regions, during, the, early, part, of, the, century, the, alans, had, migrated, to, the, area, to, the, northeast, of, the, lake, maeotis, meanwhile, the, iazyges, moved, westwards, until, they, reached, the, danube, and, the, roxolani, moved, into, the, area, between, the, dnipro, and, the, danube, and, from, there, further, west, these, two, peoples, attacked, the, regions, around, tomis, and, moesia, respectively, during, this, period, the, iazyges, and, roxolani, also, attacked, the, roman, province, of, thracia, whose, governor, tiberius, plautius, silvanus, aelianus, had, to, defend, the, roman, border, of, the, danube, during, the, 1st, century, bc, various, sarmatians, reached, the, pannonian, basin, with, the, iazyges, passing, through, the, territories, corresponding, to, modern, day, moldavia, and, wallachia, before, settling, in, the, tisza, valley, by, the, middle, of, the, century, although, the, sarmatian, movements, stopped, temporarily, during, the, 1st, century, bc, due, to, the, rise, of, the, dacian, kingdom, of, burebista, they, resumed, after, the, collapse, of, his, kingdom, following, his, assassination, and, in, 16, bc, lucius, tarius, rufus, had, to, repel, a, sarmatian, attack, on, thracia, and, macedonia, while, further, attacks, around, 10, bc, and, 2, bc, were, defeated, by, gnaeus, cornelius, lentulus, meanwhile, other, sarmatian, tribes, possibly, the, aorsi, sent, ambassadors, to, the, roman, emperor, augustus, who, tried, to, establish, a, diplomatic, accommodation, with, them, during, the, 1st, century, ad, the, siraces, and, aorsi, who, were, mutually, hostile, participated, in, the, roman, bosporan, war, on, opposite, sides, the, siraces, and, their, king, zorsines, allied, with, mithridates, iii, against, his, half, brother, cotys, i, who, was, allied, with, rome, and, the, aorsi, with, the, defeat, of, mithridates, the, siraces, were, also, routed, and, lost, rulership, over, most, of, their, lands, between, 50, and, 60, ce, the, alans, had, appeared, in, the, foothills, of, the, caucasus, from, where, they, attacked, the, caucasus, and, transcaucasus, areas, and, the, parthian, empire, during, the, 1st, century, ad, the, alans, expanded, across, the, volga, to, the, west, absorbing, part, of, the, aorsi, and, displacing, the, rest, and, pressure, from, the, alans, forced, the, iazyges, and, roxolani, to, continue, attacking, the, roman, empire, from, across, the, danube, during, the, 1st, century, ad, two, sarmatian, rulers, from, the, steppe, named, pharzoios, and, inisme, s, were, minting, coins, in, pontic, olbia, the, roxolani, continued, their, westward, migration, following, the, conflict, on, the, bosporan, chersonesus, and, by, 69, ad, they, were, close, enough, to, the, lower, danube, that, they, were, able, to, attack, across, the, river, when, it, was, frozen, in, winter, and, soon, later, they, and, the, alans, were, living, on, the, coast, of, the, black, sea, and, they, later, moved, further, west, and, were, living, in, the, areas, corresponding, to, modern, day, moldavia, and, western, ukraine, the, sarmatian, tribe, of, the, arraei, who, had, had, close, contacts, with, the, romans, eventually, settled, to, the, south, of, the, danube, river, in, thrace, and, another, sarmatian, tribe, the, koralloi, were, also, living, in, the, same, area, alongside, a, section, of, the, scythian, sindi, during, the, 1st, and, 2nd, centuries, ad, the, iazyges, often, bothered, the, roman, authorities, in, pannonia, they, participated, in, the, destruction, of, the, quadian, kingdom, of, vannius, and, often, migrated, to, the, east, across, the, transylvanian, plateau, and, the, carpathian, mountains, during, seasonal, movements, or, for, trade, by, the, 2nd, century, ad, the, alans, had, conquered, the, steppes, of, the, north, caucasus, and, of, the, north, black, sea, area, and, created, a, powerful, confederation, of, tribes, under, their, rule, under, the, hegemony, of, the, alans, a, trade, route, connected, the, pontic, steppe, the, southern, urals, and, the, region, presently, known, as, western, turkestan, one, group, of, the, alans, the, antae, migrated, north, into, the, territory, of, what, is, presently, poland, the, hegemony, of, the, sarmatians, in, the, steppes, began, to, decline, over, the, 2nd, and, 3rd, centuries, ad, when, the, huns, conquered, sarmatian, territory, in, the, caspian, steppe, and, the, ural, region, the, supremacy, of, the, sarmatians, was, finally, destroyed, when, the, germanic, goths, migrating, from, the, baltic, sea, region, conquered, the, pontic, steppe, around, 200, ad, in, 375, ad, the, huns, conquered, most, of, the, alans, living, to, the, east, of, the, don, river, massacred, a, significant, number, of, them, and, absorbed, them, into, their, tribal, polity, while, the, alans, to, the, west, of, the, don, remained, free, from, hunnish, domination, as, part, of, the, hunnic, state, the, alans, participated, in, the, huns, defeat, and, conquest, of, the, kingdom, of, the, ostrogoths, on, the, pontic, steppe, some, free, alans, fled, into, the, mountains, of, the, caucasus, where, they, participated, in, the, ethnogenesis, of, populations, including, the, ossetians, and, the, kabardians, and, other, alan, groupings, survived, in, crimea, others, migrated, into, central, and, then, western, europe, from, where, some, of, them, went, to, britannia, and, hispania, and, some, joined, the, germanic, vandals, into, crossing, the, strait, of, gibraltar, and, creating, the, vandal, kingdom, in, north, africa, the, sarmatians, in, the, bosporan, kingdom, assimilated, into, the, greek, civilization, others, assimilated, with, the, proto, circassian, meot, people, and, may, have, influenced, the, circassian, language, some, sarmatians, were, absorbed, by, the, alans, and, goths, during, the, early, middle, ages, the, proto, slavic, population, of, eastern, europe, assimilated, and, absorbed, sarmatians, during, the, political, upheavals, of, that, era, however, a, people, related, to, the, sarmatians, known, as, the, alans, survived, in, the, north, caucasus, into, the, early, middle, ages, ultimately, giving, rise, to, the, modern, ossetic, ethnic, group, in, 1947, soviet, archaeologist, boris, grakov, defined, a, culture, flourishing, from, the, 6th, century, bc, to, the, 4th, century, ad, apparent, in, late, kurgan, graves, buried, within, earthwork, mounds, sometimes, reusing, part, of, much, older, kurgans, it, was, a, nomadic, steppe, culture, ranging, from, the, black, sea, eastward, to, beyond, the, volga, that, is, especially, evident, at, two, of, the, major, sites, at, kardaielova, and, chernaya, in, the, trans, uralic, steppe, the, four, phases, distinguished, by, grave, construction, burial, customs, grave, goods, and, geographical, spread, are, while, sarmatian, and, sauromatian, are, synonymous, as, ethnonyms, by, convention, they, are, given, different, meanings, as, archaeological, technical, terms, the, term, prokhorovka, culture, derives, from, a, complex, of, mounds, in, the, prokhorovski, district, orenburg, region, excavated, by, s, i, rudenko, in, 1916, reportedly, during, 2001, and, 2006, a, great, late, sarmatian, pottery, centre, was, unearthed, near, budapest, hungary, in, the, ll, 5, archaeological, site, typical, grey, granular, ll, 5, ceramics, form, a, distinct, group, of, sarmatian, pottery, is, found, ubiquitously, in, the, north, central, part, of, the, great, hungarian, plain, region, indicating, a, lively, trading, activity, a, 1998, paper, on, the, study, of, glass, beads, found, in, sarmatian, graves, suggests, wide, cultural, and, trade, links, a, 2023, paper, on, a, grave, discovered, in, cambridgeshire, england, found, via, archaeogenetics, that, the, person, had, sarmatian, related, ancestry, and, was, not, related, to, the, local, population, stable, isotope, analysis, of, his, teeth, determined, that, he, had, probably, migrated, long, distances, twice, in, his, life, one, tooth, was, radiocarbon, dated, to, cal, 126, 228, ce, archaeological, evidence, suggests, that, scythian, sarmatian, cultures, may, have, given, rise, to, the, greek, legends, of, amazons, graves, of, armed, women, have, been, found, in, southern, ukraine, and, russia, david, anthony, noted, that, approximately, 20, of, scythian, sarmatian, warrior, graves, on, the, lower, don, and, lower, volga, contained, women, dressed, for, battle, as, warriors, and, he, asserts, that, encountering, that, cultural, phenomenon, probably, inspired, the, greek, tales, about, the, amazons, the, sarmatians, were, part, of, the, iranian, steppe, peoples, among, whom, were, also, scythians, and, saka, these, also, are, grouped, together, as, east, iranians, archaeology, has, established, the, connection, between, the, iranian, speaking, scythians, sarmatians, and, saka, and, the, earlier, timber, grave, and, andronovo, cultures, based, on, building, construction, these, three, peoples, were, the, likely, descendants, of, those, earlier, archaeological, cultures, the, sarmatians, and, saka, used, the, same, stone, construction, methods, as, the, earlier, andronovo, culture, the, timber, grave, srubnaya, culture, and, andronovo, house, building, traditions, were, further, developed, by, these, three, peoples, andronovo, pottery, was, continued, by, the, saka, and, sarmatians, archaeologists, describe, the, andronovo, culture, people, as, exhibiting, pronounced, caucasoid, features, the, first, sarmatians, are, mostly, identified, with, the, prokhorovka, culture, which, moved, from, the, southern, urals, to, the, lower, volga, and, then, to, the, northern, pontic, steppe, in, the, fourth, third, centuries, bc, during, the, migration, the, sarmatian, population, seems, to, have, grown, and, they, divided, themselves, into, several, groups, such, as, the, alans, aorsi, roxolani, and, iazyges, by, 200, bc, the, sarmatians, replaced, the, scythians, as, the, dominant, people, of, the, steppes, the, sarmatians, and, scythians, had, fought, on, the, pontic, steppe, to, the, north, of, the, black, sea, the, sarmatians, described, as, a, large, confederation, were, to, dominate, these, territories, over, the, next, five, centuries, according, to, brzezinski, and, mielczarek, the, sarmatians, were, formed, between, the, don, river, and, the, ural, mountains, pliny, the, elder, wrote, that, they, ranged, from, the, vistula, river, in, present, day, poland, to, the, danube, the, sarmatians, spoke, an, iranian, language, that, was, derived, from, old, iranian, and, was, heterogenous, by, the, first, century, ad, the, iranian, tribes, in, what, is, today, south, russia, spoke, different, languages, or, dialects, clearly, distinguishable, according, to, a, group, of, iranologists, writing, in, 1968, the, numerous, iranian, personal, names, in, greek, inscriptions, from, the, black, sea, coast, indicate, that, the, sarmatians, spoke, a, north, eastern, iranian, dialect, ancestral, to, alanian, ossetian, however, harmatta, 1970, argued, that, the, language, of, the, sarmatians, or, that, of, the, alans, as, a, whole, cannot, be, simply, regarded, as, being, old, ossetian, the, roxolani, who, were, one, of, the, earlier, sarmatian, tribes, to, have, migrated, into, europe, and, therefore, were, among, the, more, geographically, western, sarmatians, used, helmets, and, corselets, made, of, raw, ox, hide, and, wicker, shields, as, well, as, spears, bows, and, swords, the, roxolani, adopted, these, forms, of, armour, and, weaponry, from, the, germanic, bastarnae, near, whom, they, lived, the, more, eastern, sarmatian, tribes, used, scale, armour, and, used, a, long, lance, called, the, contus, and, bows, in, battle, the, early, sarmatians, already, possessed, the, technique, of, decorating, with, gold, inclusions, observed, in, achaemenid, metalwork, it, was, spread, by, nomads, in, the, eurasian, steppes, during, the, 7th, 5th, century, bc, from, the, altai, mountains, arzhan, 2, kurgan, westward, to, central, kazakhstan, and, the, southern, urals, peter, the, great, particularly, cherished, his, demidov, gift, a, sarmatian, gold, collection, now, exhibited, in, the, gold, chamber, at, the, hermitage, museum, in, st, petersburg, the, novocherkassk, treasure, with, the, famous, sarmatian, diadem, adorned, with, the, tree, of, life, can, also, be, seen, in, the, hermitage, gold, room, it, is, a, sarmatian, hoard, of, gold, silver, and, bronze, articles, and, jewellery, discovered, in, the, khokhlach, barrow, in, novocherkassk, in, 1864, chronologically, it, belongs, to, the, first, and, second, centuries, ad, numerous, weapons, armour, helmets, were, already, found, in, the, excavations, of, the, early, sarmatian, filippovka, kurgan, c, 450, 300, bce, many, chinese, mirrors, can, be, found, in, graves, of, the, middle, sarmatian, to, late, sarmatian, periods, sarmatians, emerged, primarily, from, the, bronze, and, iron, age, western, steppe, herders, steppe, mlba, associated, with, the, sintashta, srubnaya, and, andronovo, cultures, but, also, carried, a, small, amount, of, admixed, from, an, east, asian, derived, population, represented, by, kh, vsg, l, lba, groups, which, may, have, been, indirectly, mediated, via, contact, with, the, related, saka, from, the, altai, region, which, are, regared, as, the, oldest, scythoid, cultural, group, the, sarmatians, also, received, geneflow, from, an, ancient, iranian, population, associated, with, the, bactria, margiana, archaeological, complex, a, genetic, study, published, in, current, biology, in, 2022, regarding, the, genetic, origin, of, huns, avars, and, conquering, hungarians, 265, ancient, genomes, were, analized, it, revealed, that, the, hungarian, conquerors, admixed, with, sarmatians, and, huns, sarmatian, ancestry, was, also, detected, among, several, hun, samples, which, implies, a, significant, sarmatian, influence, on, european, huns, there, is, also, evidence, for, a, later, eastwards, expansion, of,

and, having, blond, hair, for, instance, roger, batty, has, posited, that, presumably, only, some, of, the, alans, would, have, been, blond, bernard, bachrach, has, likewise, suggested, that, because, the, alans, assimilated, so, many, foreigners, the, majority, of, them, are, unlikely, to, have, been, blond, haired, and, that, there, was, no, distinguishing, physical, characteristic, of, the, alans, however, john, day, has, argued, that, bachrach, s, analysis, is, flawed, because, he, mistranslated, the, original, passage, from, ammianus, marcellinus, and, that, the, majority, of, the, alans, were, in, fact, blond, iver, neumann, has, suggested, that, the, description, of, alans, as, blond, may, mean, that, their, indo, iranian, ancestry, was, greater, than, it, was, in, the, huns,
