conflict, resolved, diplomatically, the, cuban, missile, crisis, also, known, as, the, october, crisis, spanish, crisis, de, octubre, in, cuba, or, the, caribbean, crisis, russian, romanized, karibskiy, krizis, was, a, 13, day, confrontation, between, the, governments, of, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, when, american, deployments, of, nuclear, missiles, in, italy, and, turkey, were, matched, by, soviet, deployments, of, nuclear, missiles, in, cuba, the, crisis, lasted, from, 16, to, 28, october, 1962, the, confrontation, is, widely, considered, the, closest, the, cold, war, came, to, escalating, into, full, scale, nuclear, war, in, 1961, the, us, government, put, jupiter, nuclear, missiles, in, italy, and, turkey, it, had, trained, a, paramilitary, force, of, expatriate, cubans, which, the, cia, led, in, an, attempt, to, invade, cuba, and, overthrow, its, government, starting, in, november, of, that, year, the, us, government, engaged, in, a, violent, campaign, of, terrorism, and, sabotage, in, cuba, referred, to, as, the, cuban, project, which, continued, throughout, the, first, half, of, the, 1960s, the, soviet, administration, was, concerned, about, a, cuban, drift, towards, china, with, which, the, soviets, had, an, increasingly, fractious, relationship, in, response, to, these, factors, the, soviet, and, cuban, governments, agreed, at, a, meeting, between, leaders, nikita, khrushchev, and, fidel, castro, in, july, 1962, to, place, nuclear, missiles, on, cuba, to, deter, a, future, us, invasion, construction, of, launch, facilities, started, shortly, thereafter, a, u, 2, spy, plane, captured, photographic, evidence, of, medium, and, long, range, launch, facilities, in, october, us, president, john, f, kennedy, convened, a, meeting, of, the, national, security, council, and, other, key, advisers, forming, the, executive, committee, of, the, national, security, council, excomm, kennedy, was, advised, to, carry, out, an, air, strike, on, cuban, soil, in, order, to, compromise, soviet, missile, supplies, followed, by, an, invasion, of, the, cuban, mainland, he, chose, a, less, aggressive, course, in, order, to, avoid, a, declaration, of, war, on, 22, october, kennedy, ordered, a, naval, blockade, to, prevent, further, missiles, from, reaching, cuba, he, referred, to, the, blockade, as, a, quarantine, not, as, a, blockade, so, the, us, could, avoid, the, formal, implications, of, a, state, of, war, an, agreement, was, eventually, reached, between, kennedy, and, khrushchev, publicly, the, soviets, would, dismantle, their, offensive, weapons, in, cuba, subject, to, united, nations, verification, in, exchange, for, a, us, public, declaration, and, agreement, not, to, invade, cuba, again, secretly, the, united, states, agreed, to, dismantle, all, of, the, offensive, weapons, it, had, deployed, to, turkey, there, has, been, debate, on, whether, italy, was, also, included, in, the, agreement, while, the, soviets, dismantled, their, missiles, some, soviet, bombers, remained, in, cuba, and, the, united, states, kept, the, naval, quarantine, in, place, until, 20, november, 1962, the, blockade, was, formally, ended, on, 20, november, after, all, offensive, missiles, and, bombers, had, been, withdrawn, from, cuba, the, evident, necessity, of, a, quick, and, direct, communication, line, between, the, two, powers, resulted, in, the, moscow, washington, hotline, a, series, of, agreements, later, reduced, us, soviet, tensions, for, several, years, the, compromise, embarrassed, khrushchev, and, the, soviet, union, because, the, withdrawal, of, us, missiles, from, italy, and, turkey, was, a, secret, deal, between, kennedy, and, khrushchev, and, the, soviets, were, seen, as, retreating, from, a, situation, that, they, had, started, khrushchev, s, fall, from, power, two, years, later, was, in, part, because, of, the, soviet, politburo, s, embarrassment, at, both, khrushchev, s, eventual, concessions, to, the, us, and, his, ineptitude, in, precipitating, the, crisis, according, to, the, soviet, ambassador, to, the, united, states, anatoly, dobrynin, the, top, soviet, leadership, took, the, cuban, outcome, as, a, blow, to, its, prestige, bordering, on, humiliation, in, late, 1961, fidel, castro, asked, for, more, sa, 2, anti, aircraft, missiles, from, the, soviet, union, the, request, was, not, acted, upon, by, the, soviet, leadership, in, the, interval, castro, began, criticizing, the, soviets, for, lack, of, revolutionary, boldness, and, began, talking, to, china, about, agreements, for, economic, assistance, in, march, 1962, castro, ordered, the, ousting, of, anibal, escalante, and, his, pro, moscow, comrades, from, cuba, s, integrated, revolutionary, organizations, this, affair, alarmed, the, soviet, leadership, as, well, as, raised, fears, of, a, possible, us, invasion, as, a, result, the, soviet, union, sent, more, sa, 2, anti, aircraft, missiles, in, april, as, well, as, a, regiment, of, regular, soviet, troops, historian, timothy, naftali, has, contended, that, escalante, s, dismissal, was, a, motivating, factor, behind, the, soviet, decision, to, place, nuclear, missiles, in, cuba, in, 1962, according, to, naftali, soviet, foreign, policy, planners, were, concerned, castro, s, break, with, escalante, foreshadowed, a, cuban, drift, toward, china, and, sought, to, solidify, the, soviet, cuban, relationship, through, the, missile, basing, program, the, cuban, government, regarded, us, imperialism, as, the, primary, explanation, for, the, island, s, structural, weaknesses, the, us, government, provided, weapons, money, and, its, authority, to, the, military, dictatorship, of, fulgencio, batista, that, ruled, cuba, until, 1958, the, majority, of, the, cuban, population, had, tired, of, the, severe, socioeconomic, problems, associated, with, the, us, domination, of, the, country, the, cuban, government, was, thus, aware, of, the, necessity, of, ending, the, turmoil, and, incongruities, of, us, dominated, prerevolution, cuban, society, it, determined, that, the, us, government, s, demands, made, as, part, of, the, hostile, us, reaction, to, cuban, government, policy, were, unacceptable, with, the, end, of, world, war, ii, and, the, start, of, the, cold, war, the, united, states, government, sought, to, promote, private, enterprise, as, an, instrument, for, advancing, us, strategic, interests, in, the, developing, world, it, had, grown, concerned, about, the, expansion, of, communism, in, december, 1959, under, the, eisenhower, administration, and, less, than, twelve, months, after, the, cuban, revolution, the, central, intelligence, agency, cia, developed, a, plan, for, paramilitary, action, against, cuba, the, cia, recruited, operatives, on, the, island, to, carry, out, terrorism, and, sabotage, kill, civilians, and, cause, economic, damage, at, the, initiative, of, the, cia, deputy, director, for, plans, richard, bissell, and, approved, by, the, new, president, john, f, kennedy, the, us, launched, the, attempted, bay, of, pigs, invasion, in, april, 1961, it, used, cia, trained, forces, of, cuban, expatriates, the, complete, failure, of, the, invasion, and, the, exposure, of, the, us, government, role, before, the, operation, began, was, a, source, of, diplomatic, embarrassment, for, the, kennedy, administration, afterward, former, president, eisenhower, told, kennedy, that, the, failure, of, the, bay, of, pigs, will, embolden, the, soviets, to, do, something, that, they, would, otherwise, not, do, 10, following, the, failed, invasion, the, us, massively, escalated, its, sponsorship, of, terrorism, against, cuba, starting, in, late, 1961, using, the, military, and, the, cia, the, us, government, engaged, in, an, extensive, campaign, of, state, sponsored, terrorism, against, civilian, and, military, targets, on, the, island, the, terrorist, attacks, killed, significant, numbers, of, civilians, the, us, armed, trained, funded, and, directed, the, terrorists, most, of, whom, were, cuban, expatriates, terrorist, attacks, were, planned, at, the, direction, and, with, the, participation, of, us, government, employees, and, launched, from, us, territory, in, january, 1962, us, air, force, general, edward, lansdale, described, the, plans, to, overthrow, the, cuban, government, in, a, top, secret, report, addressed, to, kennedy, and, officials, involved, with, operation, mongoose, cia, agents, or, pathfinders, from, the, special, activities, division, were, to, be, infiltrated, into, cuba, to, carry, out, sabotage, and, organization, including, radio, broadcasts, in, february, 1962, the, us, launched, an, embargo, against, cuba, and, lansdale, presented, a, 26, page, top, secret, timetable, for, implementation, of, the, overthrow, of, the, cuban, government, mandating, guerrilla, operations, to, begin, in, august, and, september, open, revolt, and, overthrow, of, the, communist, regime, was, hoped, by, the, planners, to, occur, in, the, first, two, weeks, of, october, the, terrorism, campaign, and, the, threat, of, invasion, were, crucial, factors, in, the, soviet, decision, to, position, the, missiles, on, cuba, and, in, the, cuban, government, s, decision, to, accept, the, us, government, was, aware, at, the, time, as, reported, to, the, president, in, a, national, intelligence, estimate, that, the, invasion, threat, was, a, key, reason, for, cuban, acceptance, of, the, missiles, when, kennedy, ran, for, president, in, 1960, one, of, his, key, election, issues, was, an, alleged, missile, gap, with, the, soviets, in, fact, the, us, at, that, time, led, the, soviets, by, a, wide, margin, which, would, only, increase, over, time, in, 1961, the, soviets, had, only, four, r, 7, semyorka, intercontinental, ballistic, missiles, icbms, by, october, 1962, some, intelligence, estimates, indicated, a, figure, of, 75, the, us, on, the, other, hand, had, 170, icbms, and, was, quickly, building, more, it, also, had, eight, george, washington, and, ethan, allen, class, ballistic, missile, submarines, with, the, capability, to, launch, 16, polaris, missiles, each, with, a, range, of, 2, 500, nautical, miles, 4, 600, km, the, soviet, first, secretary, nikita, khrushchev, increased, the, perception, of, a, missile, gap, when, he, loudly, boasted, to, the, world, that, the, soviets, were, building, missiles, like, sausages, but, soviet, missiles, numbers, and, capabilities, were, nowhere, close, to, his, assertions, the, soviet, union, had, medium, range, ballistic, missiles, in, quantity, about, 700, of, them, but, they, were, unreliable, and, inaccurate, the, us, had, a, considerable, advantage, in, its, total, number, of, nuclear, warheads, 27, 000, against, 3, 600, and, in, the, technology, required, for, their, accurate, delivery, the, us, also, led, in, missile, defensive, capabilities, naval, and, air, power, however, the, soviets, held, a, two, to, one, advantage, in, conventional, ground, forces, more, pronounced, in, field, guns, and, tanks, particularly, in, the, european, theatre, khrushchev, also, had, an, impression, of, kennedy, as, weak, which, to, him, was, confirmed, by, the, president, s, response, during, the, berlin, crisis, of, 1961, particularly, to, the, building, of, the, berlin, wall, by, east, germany, to, prevent, its, citizens, from, emigrating, to, the, west, the, half, hearted, nature, of, the, bay, of, pigs, invasion, reinforced, khrushchev, s, and, his, advisers, impression, that, kennedy, was, indecisive, and, as, one, soviet, aide, wrote, too, young, intellectual, not, prepared, well, for, decision, making, in, crisis, situations, too, intelligent, and, too, weak, speaking, to, soviet, officials, in, the, aftermath, of, the, crisis, khrushchev, asserted, i, know, for, certain, that, kennedy, doesn, t, have, a, strong, background, nor, generally, speaking, does, he, have, the, courage, to, stand, up, to, a, serious, challenge, he, also, told, his, son, sergei, that, on, cuba, kennedy, would, make, a, fuss, make, more, of, a, fuss, and, then, agree, in, may, 1962, soviet, first, secretary, nikita, khrushchev, was, persuaded, by, the, idea, of, countering, the, us, s, growing, lead, in, developing, and, deploying, strategic, missiles, by, placing, soviet, intermediate, range, nuclear, missiles, in, cuba, despite, the, misgivings, of, the, soviet, ambassador, in, havana, alexandr, ivanovich, alexeyev, who, argued, that, castro, would, not, accept, the, deployment, of, the, missiles, khrushchev, faced, a, strategic, situation, in, which, the, us, was, perceived, to, have, a, splendid, first, strike, capability, that, put, the, soviet, union, at, a, huge, disadvantage, in, 1962, the, soviets, had, only, 20, icbms, capable, of, delivering, nuclear, warheads, to, the, us, from, inside, the, soviet, union, the, poor, accuracy, and, reliability, of, the, missiles, raised, serious, doubts, about, their, effectiveness, a, newer, more, reliable, generation, of, icbms, would, become, operational, only, after, 1965, therefore, soviet, nuclear, capability, in, 1962, placed, less, emphasis, on, icbms, than, on, medium, and, intermediate, range, ballistic, missiles, mrbms, and, irbms, the, missiles, could, hit, american, allies, and, most, of, alaska, from, soviet, territory, but, not, the, contiguous, united, states, graham, allison, the, director, of, harvard, university, s, belfer, center, for, science, and, international, affairs, points, out, the, soviet, union, could, not, right, the, nuclear, imbalance, by, deploying, new, icbms, on, its, own, soil, in, order, to, meet, the, threat, it, faced, in, 1962, 1963, and, 1964, it, had, very, few, options, moving, existing, nuclear, weapons, to, locations, from, which, they, could, reach, american, targets, was, one, a, second, reason, that, soviet, missiles, were, deployed, to, cuba, was, that, khrushchev, wanted, to, bring, west, berlin, controlled, by, the, american, british, and, french, within, communist, east, germany, into, the, soviet, orbit, the, east, germans, and, soviets, considered, western, control, over, a, portion, of, berlin, a, grave, threat, to, east, germany, khrushchev, made, west, berlin, the, central, battlefield, of, the, cold, war, khrushchev, believed, that, if, the, us, did, nothing, over, the, missile, deployments, in, cuba, he, could, muscle, the, west, out, of, berlin, using, said, missiles, as, a, deterrent, to, western, countermeasures, in, berlin, if, the, us, tried, to, bargain, with, the, soviets, after, it, became, aware, of, the, missiles, khrushchev, could, demand, trading, the, missiles, for, west, berlin, since, berlin, was, strategically, more, important, than, cuba, the, trade, would, be, a, win, for, khrushchev, as, kennedy, recognized, the, advantage, is, from, khrushchev, s, point, of, view, he, takes, a, great, chance, but, there, are, quite, some, rewards, to, it, thirdly, from, the, perspective, of, the, soviet, union, and, of, cuba, it, seemed, that, the, united, states, wanted, to, invade, or, increase, its, presence, in, cuba, in, view, of, actions, including, the, attempt, to, expel, cuba, from, the, organization, of, american, states, the, ongoing, campaign, of, violent, terrorist, attacks, on, civilians, the, us, was, carrying, out, against, the, island, economic, sanctions, against, the, country, and, the, earlier, attempt, to, invade, it, cuban, officials, understood, that, america, was, trying, to, overrun, the, country, as, a, result, to, try, to, prevent, this, the, ussr, would, place, missiles, in, cuba, and, neutralise, the, threat, this, would, ultimately, serve, to, secure, cuba, against, attack, and, keep, the, country, in, the, socialist, bloc, another, major, reason, why, khrushchev, planned, to, place, missiles, on, cuba, undetected, was, to, level, the, playing, field, with, the, evident, american, nuclear, threat, america, had, the, upper, hand, as, they, could, launch, from, turkey, and, destroy, the, ussr, before, they, would, have, a, chance, to, react, after, the, emplacement, of, nuclear, missiles, in, cuba, khrushchev, had, finally, established, mutual, assured, destruction, meaning, that, if, the, united, states, decided, to, launch, a, nuclear, strike, against, the, soviet, union, the, latter, would, react, by, launching, a, retaliatory, nuclear, strike, against, the, us, finally, placing, nuclear, missiles, on, cuba, was, a, way, for, the, ussr, to, show, their, support, for, cuba, and, support, the, cuban, people, who, viewed, the, united, states, as, a, threatening, force, as, the, ussr, had, become, cuba, s, ally, after, the, cuban, revolution, of, 1959, according, to, khrushchev, the, soviet, union, s, motives, were, aimed, at, allowing, cuba, to, live, peacefully, and, develop, as, its, people, desire, arthur, m, schlesinger, jr, a, historian, and, adviser, to, kennedy, told, national, public, radio, in, an, interview, on, 16, october, 2002, that, castro, did, not, want, the, missiles, but, khrushchev, pressured, castro, to, accept, them, castro, was, not, completely, happy, with, the, idea, but, the, cuban, national, directorate, of, the, revolution, accepted, them, both, to, protect, cuba, against, us, attack, and, to, aid, the, soviet, union, 272, in, early, 1962, a, group, of, soviet, military, and, missile, construction, specialists, accompanied, an, agricultural, delegation, to, havana, they, obtained, a, meeting, with, cuban, prime, minister, fidel, castro, according, to, one, report, cuban, leadership, had, a, strong, expectation, that, the, us, would, invade, cuba, again, and, enthusiastically, approved, the, idea, of, installing, nuclear, missiles, in, cuba, according, to, another, source, castro, objected, to, the, missiles, deployment, as, making, him, look, like, a, soviet, puppet, but, he, was, persuaded, that, missiles, in, cuba, would, be, an, irritant, to, the, us, and, help, the, interests, of, the, entire, socialist, camp, the, deployment, would, include, short, range, tactical, weapons, with, a, range, of, 40, km, usable, only, against, naval, vessels, that, would, provide, a, nuclear, umbrella, for, attacks, upon, the, island, by, may, khrushchev, and, castro, agreed, to, place, strategic, nuclear, missiles, secretly, in, cuba, like, castro, khrushchev, felt, that, a, us, invasion, of, cuba, was, imminent, and, that, to, lose, cuba, would, do, great, harm, to, the, communists, especially, in, latin, america, he, said, he, wanted, to, confront, the, americans, with, more, than, words, the, logical, answer, was, missiles, 29, the, soviets, maintained, their, tight, secrecy, writing, their, plans, longhand, which, were, approved, by, marshal, of, the, soviet, union, rodion, malinovsky, on, 4, july, and, khrushchev, on, 7, july, from, the, very, beginning, the, soviets, operation, entailed, elaborate, denial, and, deception, known, as, maskirovka, all, the, planning, and, preparation, for, transporting, and, deploying, the, missiles, were, carried, out, in, the, utmost, secrecy, with, only, a, very, few, told, the, exact, nature, of, the, mission, even, the, troops, detailed, for, the, mission, were, given, misdirection, by, being, told, that, they, were, headed, for, a, cold, region, and, being, outfitted, with, ski, boots, fleece, lined, parkas, and, other, winter, equipment, the, soviet, code, name, was, operation, anadyr, the, anadyr, river, flows, into, the, bering, sea, and, anadyr, is, also, the, capital, of, chukotsky, district, and, a, bomber, base, in, the, far, eastern, region, all, the, measures, were, meant, to, conceal, the, program, from, both, internal, and, external, audiences, specialists, in, missile, construction, under, the, guise, of, machine, operators, and, agricultural, specialists, arrived, in, july, a, total, of, 43, 000, foreign, troops, would, ultimately, be, brought, in, chief, marshal, of, artillery, sergei, biryuzov, head, of, the, soviet, rocket, forces, led, a, survey, team, that, visited, cuba, he, told, khrushchev, that, the, missiles, would, be, concealed, and, camouflaged, by, palm, trees, the, soviet, troops, would, arrive, in, cuba, heavily, underprepared, they, did, not, know, that, the, tropical, climate, would, render, ineffective, many, of, their, weapons, and, much, of, their, equipment, in, the, first, few, days, of, setting, up, the, missiles, troops, complained, of, fuse, failures, excessive, corrosion, overconsumption, of, oil, and, generator, blackouts, as, early, as, august, 1962, the, us, suspected, the, soviets, of, building, missile, facilities, in, cuba, during, that, month, its, intelligence, services, gathered, information, about, sightings, by, ground, observers, of, soviet, built, mig, 21, fighters, and, il, 28, light, bombers, u, 2, spy, planes, found, s, 75, dvina, nato, designation, sa, 2, surface, to, air, missile, sites, at, eight, different, locations, cia, director, john, a, mccone, was, suspicious, sending, antiaircraft, missiles, into, cuba, he, reasoned, made, sense, only, if, moscow, intended, to, use, them, to, shield, a, base, for, ballistic, missiles, aimed, at, the, united, states, on, 10, august, he, wrote, a, memo, to, kennedy, in, which, he, guessed, that, the, soviets, were, preparing, to, introduce, ballistic, missiles, into, cuba, che, guevara, himself, traveled, to, the, soviet, union, on, 30, august, 1962, to, sign, off, on, the, final, agreement, regarding, the, deployment, of, missiles, in, cuba, the, visit, was, heavily, monitored, by, the, cia, as, guevara, had, gained, more, scrutiny, by, american, intelligence, while, in, the, soviet, union, guevara, argued, with, khrushchev, that, the, missile, deal, should, be, made, public, but, khrushchev, insisted, on, total, secrecy, and, swore, the, soviet, union, s, support, if, the, americans, discovered, the, missiles, by, the, time, guevara, arrived, in, cuba, the, united, states, had, already, discovered, the, soviet, troops, in, cuba, via, u, 2, spy, planes, with, important, congressional, elections, scheduled, for, november, the, crisis, became, enmeshed, in, american, politics, on, 31, august, senator, kenneth, keating, r, new, york, warned, on, the, senate, floor, that, the, soviet, union, was, in, all, probability, constructing, a, missile, base, in, cuba, he, charged, the, kennedy, administration, with, covering, up, a, major, threat, to, the, us, thereby, starting, the, crisis, he, may, have, received, this, initial, remarkably, accurate, information, from, his, friend, former, congresswoman, and, ambassador, clare, boothe, luce, who, in, turn, received, it, from, cuban, exiles, a, later, confirming, source, for, keating, s, information, possibly, was, the, west, german, ambassador, to, cuba, who, had, received, information, from, dissidents, inside, cuba, that, soviet, troops, had, arrived, in, cuba, in, early, august, and, were, seen, working, in, all, probability, on, or, near, a, missile, base, and, who, passed, this, information, to, keating, on, a, trip, to, washington, in, early, october, air, force, general, curtis, lemay, presented, a, pre, invasion, bombing, plan, to, kennedy, in, september, and, spy, flights, and, minor, military, harassment, from, us, forces, at, guantanamo, bay, naval, base, were, the, subject, of, continual, cuban, diplomatic, complaints, to, the, us, government, the, first, consignment, of, soviet, r, 12, missiles, arrived, on, the, night, of, 8, september, followed, by, a, second, on, 16, september, the, r, 12, was, a, medium, range, ballistic, missile, capable, of, carrying, a, thermonuclear, warhead, it, was, a, single, stage, road, transportable, surface, launched, storable, liquid, propellant, fuelled, missile, that, could, deliver, a, megaton, class, nuclear, weapon, the, soviets, were, building, nine, sites, six, for, r, 12, medium, range, missiles, nato, designation, ss, 4, sandal, with, an, effective, range, of, 2, 000, kilometres, 1, 200, mi, and, three, for, r, 14, intermediate, range, ballistic, missiles, nato, designation, ss, 5, skean, with, a, maximum, range, of, 4, 500, kilometres, 2, 800, mi, on, 7, october, cuban, president, osvaldo, dortic, s, torrado, spoke, at, the, un, general, assembly, if, we, are, attacked, we, will, defend, ourselves, i, repeat, we, have, sufficient, means, with, which, to, defend, ourselves, we, have, indeed, our, inevitable, weapons, the, weapons, which, we, would, have, preferred, not, to, acquire, and, which, we, do, not, wish, to, employ, on, 11, october, in, another, senate, speech, sen, keating, reaffirmed, his, earlier, warning, of, 31, august, and, stated, that, construction, has, begun, on, at, least, a, half, dozen, launching, sites, for, intermediate, range, tactical, missiles, the, cuban, leadership, was, further, upset, when, on, 20, september, the, us, senate, approved, joint, resolution, 230, which, expressed, the, us, was, determined, to, prevent, in, cuba, the, creation, or, use, of, an, externally, supported, military, capability, endangering, the, security, of, the, united, states, on, the, same, day, the, us, announced, a, major, military, exercise, in, the, caribbean, phibriglex, 62, which, cuba, denounced, as, a, deliberate, provocation, and, proof, that, the, us, planned, to, invade, cuba, the, soviet, leadership, believed, based, on, its, perception, of, kennedy, s, lack, of, confidence, during, the, bay, of, pigs, invasion, that,

that, were, carrying, supplies, to, the, island, would, mean, war, the, soviets, continued, the, maskirovka, program, to, conceal, their, actions, in, cuba, they, repeatedly, denied, that, the, weapons, being, brought, into, cuba, were, offensive, in, nature, on, 7, september, soviet, ambassador, to, the, united, states, anatoly, dobrynin, assured, united, states, ambassador, to, the,

noticed, the, arrival, and, deployment, of, the, missiles, and, hundreds, of, reports, reached, miami, us, intelligence, received, countless, reports, many, of, dubious, quality, or, even, laughable, most, of, which, could, be, dismissed, as, describing, defensive, missiles, only, five, reports, bothered, the, analysts, they, described, large, trucks, passing, through, towns, at, night, that, were, carrying, very, long, canvas, covered, cylindrical, objects, that, could, not, make, turns, through, towns, without, backing, up, and, maneuvering, defensive, missile, transporters, it, was, believed, could, make, such, turns, without, undue, difficulty, the, reports, could, not, be, satisfactorily, dismissed, the, united, states, had, been, sending, u, 2, surveillance, over, cuba, since, the, failed, bay, of, pigs, invasion, the, first, issue, that, led, to, a, pause, in, reconnaissance, flights, took, place, on, 30, august, when, a, u, 2, operated, by, the, us, air, force, s, strategic, air, command, flew, over, sakhalin, island, in, the, soviet, far, east, by, mistake, the, soviets, lodged, a, protest, and, the, us, apologized, nine, days, later, a, taiwanese, operated, u, 2, was, lost, over, western, china, to, an, sa, 2, surface, to, air, missile, sam, us, officials, were, worried, that, one, of, the, cuban, or, soviet, sams, in, cuba, might, shoot, down, a, cia,

national, security, advisor, mcgeorge, bundy, heavily, restricted, further, u, 2, flights, over, cuban, airspace, the, resulting, lack, of, coverage, over, the, island, for, the, next, five, weeks, became, known, to, historians, as, the, photo, gap, no, significant, u, 2, coverage, was, achieved, over, the, interior, of, the, island, us, officials, attempted, to, use, a, corona, photo, reconnaissance, satellite, to, obtain, coverage, over, reported, soviet, military, deployments, but, imagery, acquired, over, western, cuba, by, a, corona, kh, 4, mission, on, october, 1, was,

with, large, crates, on, its, deck, the, size, and, shape, of, il, 28, jet, bomber, fuselages, in, september, 1962, analysts, from, the, defense, intelligence, agency, dia, noticed, that, cuban, surface, to, air, missile, sites, were, arranged, in, a, pattern, similar, to, those, used, by, the, soviet, union, to, protect, its, icbm, bases, leading, dia, to, lobby, for, the, resumption, of, u, 2, flights, over, the, island, although, in, the, past, the, flights, had, been, conducted, by, the, cia, pressure, from, the, defense, department, led, to, that, authority, being, transferred, to, the, air, force, following, the, loss, of, a, cia, u, 2, over, the, soviet, union, in, may, 1960, it, was, thought, that, if, another, u, 2, were, shot, down, an, air, force, aircraft, arguably, being, used, for, a, legitimate, military, purpose, would, be, easier, to, explain, than, a, cia, flight, when, the, reconnaissance, missions, were, reauthorized, on, 9, october, poor, weather, kept, the, planes, from, flying, the, us, first, obtained, u, 2, photographic, evidence, of, the, missiles, on, 14, october, when, a, u, 2, flight, piloted, by, major, richard, heyser, took, 928, pictures, on, a, path, selected, by, dia, analysts, capturing, images, of, what, turned, out, to, be, an, ss, 4, construction, site, at, san, crist, bal, pinar, del, r, o, province, now, in, artemisa, province, in, western, cuba, on, 15, october, the, cia, s, national, photographic, interpretation, center, npic, reviewed, the, u, 2, photographs, and, identified, objects, that, they, interpreted, as, medium, range, ballistic, missiles, this, identification, was, made, in, part, on, the, strength, of, reporting, provided, by, oleg, penkovsky, a, double, agent, in, the, gru, working, for, the, cia, and, mi6, although, he, provided, no, direct, reports, of, the, soviet, missile, deployments, to, cuba, technical, and, doctrinal, details, of, soviet, missile, regiments, that, had, been, provided, by, penkovsky, in, the, months, and, years, prior, to, the, crisis, helped, npic, analysts, correctly, identify, the, missiles, on, u, 2, imagery, that, evening, the, cia, notified, the, department, of, state, and, at, 8, 30, pm, edt, bundy, chose, to, wait, until, the, next, morning, to, tell, the, president, mcnamara, was, briefed, at, midnight, the, next, morning, bundy, met, with, kennedy, and, showed, him, the, u, 2, photographs, and, briefed, him, on, the, cia, s, analysis, of, the, images, at, 6, 30, pm, edt, kennedy, convened, a, meeting, of, the, nine, members, of, the, national, security, council, and, five, other, key, advisers, in, a, group, he, formally, named, the, executive, committee, of, the, national, security, council, excomm, after, the, fact, on, 22, october, by, national, security, action, memorandum, 196, without, informing, the, members, of, excomm, president, kennedy, tape, recorded, all, of, their, proceedings, and, sheldon, m, stern, head, of, the, kennedy, library, transcribed, some, of, them, on, 16, october, president, kennedy, notified, attorney, general, robert, kennedy, that, he, was, convinced, the, soviets, were, placing, missiles, in, cuba, and, it, was, a, legitimate, threat, this, made, the, threat, of, nuclear, destruction, by, two, world, superpowers, a, reality, robert, kennedy, responded, by, contacting, the, soviet, ambassador, anatoly, dobrynin, robert, kennedy, expressed, his, concern, about, what, was, happening, and, dobrynin, was, instructed, by, soviet, chairman, nikita, s, khrushchev, to, assure, president, kennedy, that, there, would, be, no, ground, to, ground, missiles, or, offensive, weapons, placed, in, cuba, khrushchev, further, assured, kennedy, that, the, soviet, union, had, no, intention, of, disrupting, the, relationship, of, our, two, countries, despite, the, photo, evidence, presented, before, president, kennedy, the, us, had, no, plan, in, place, because, until, recently, its, intelligence, had, been, convinced, that, the, soviets, would, never, install, nuclear, missiles, in, cuba, excomm, discussed, several, possible, courses, of, action, the, joint, chiefs, of, staff, unanimously, agreed, that, a, full, scale, attack, and, invasion, was, the, only, solution, they, believed, that, the, soviets, would, not, attempt, to, stop, the, us, from, conquering, cuba, kennedy, was, skeptical, they, no, more, than, we, can, let, these, things, go, by, without, doing, something, they, can, t, after, all, their, statements, permit, us, to, take, out, their, missiles, kill, a, lot, of, russians, and, then, do, nothing, if, they, don, t, take, action, in, cuba, they, certainly, will, in, berlin, kennedy, concluded, that, attacking, cuba, by, air, would, signal, the, soviets, to, presume, a, clear, line, to, conquer, berlin, kennedy, also, believed, that, us, allies, would, think, of, the, country, as, trigger, happy, cowboys, who, lost, berlin, because, they, could, not, peacefully, resolve, the, cuban, situation, the, excomm, then, discussed, the, effect, on, the, strategic, balance, of, power, both, political, and, military, the, joint, chiefs, of, staff, believed, that, the, missiles, would, seriously, alter, the, military, balance, but, mcnamara, disagreed, an, extra, 40, he, reasoned, would, make, little, difference, to, the, overall, strategic, balance, the, us, already, had, approximately, 5, 000, strategic, warheads, 261, but, the, soviet, union, had, only, 300, mcnamara, concluded, that, the, soviets, having, 340, would, not, therefore, substantially, alter, the, strategic, balance, in, 1990, he, reiterated, that, it, made, no, difference, the, military, balance, wasn, t, changed, i, didn, t, believe, it, then, and, i, don, t, believe, it, now, the, excomm, agreed, that, the, missiles, would, affect, the, political, balance, kennedy, had, explicitly, promised, the, american, people, less, than, a, month, before, the, crisis, that, if, cuba, should, possess, a, capacity, to, carry, out, offensive, actions, against, the, united, states, the, united, states, would, act, 674, 681, further, us, credibility, among, its, allies, and, people, would, be, damaged, if, the, soviet, union, appeared, to, redress, the, strategic, imbalance, by, placing, missiles, in, cuba, kennedy, explained, after, the, crisis, that, it, would, have, politically, changed, the, balance, of, power, it, would, have, appeared, to, and, appearances, contribute, to, reality, on, 18, october, kennedy, met, with, soviet, minister, of, foreign, affairs, andrei, gromyko, who, claimed, the, weapons, were, for, defensive, purposes, only, not, wanting, to, expose, what, he, already, knew, and, to, avoid, panicking, the, american, public, kennedy, did, not, reveal, that, he, was, already, aware, of, the, missile, buildup, two, operational, plans, oplan, were, considered, oplan, 316, envisioned, a, full, invasion, of, cuba, by, army, and, marine, units, supported, by, the, navy, following, air, force, and, naval, airstrikes, army, units, in, the, us, would, have, had, trouble, fielding, mechanised, and, logistical, assets, and, the, us, navy, could, not, supply, enough, amphibious, shipping, to, transport, even, a, modest, armoured, contingent, from, the, army, oplan, 312, primarily, an, air, force, and, navy, carrier, operation, was, designed, with, enough, flexibility, to, do, anything, from, engaging, individual, missile, sites, to, providing, air, support, for, oplan, 316, s, ground, forces, kennedy, met, with, members, of, excomm, and, other, top, advisers, throughout, 21, october, considering, two, remaining, options, an, air, strike, primarily, against, the, cuban, missile, bases, or, a, naval, blockade, of, cuba, a, full, scale, invasion, was, not, the, administration, s, first, option, mcnamara, supported, the, naval, blockade, as, a, strong, but, limited, military, action, that, left, the, us, in, control, the, term, blockade, was, problematic, according, to, international, law, a, blockade, is, an, act, of, war, but, the, kennedy, administration, did, not, think, that, the, soviets, would, be, provoked, to, attack, by, a, mere, blockade, additionally, legal, experts, at, the, state, department, and, justice, department, concluded, that, a, declaration, of, war, could, be, avoided, if, another, legal, justification, based, on, the, rio, treaty, for, defence, of, the, western, hemisphere, was, obtained, from, a, resolution, by, a, two, thirds, vote, from, the, members, of, the, organization, of, american, states, oas, admiral, george, anderson, chief, of, naval, operations, wrote, a, position, paper, that, helped, kennedy, to, differentiate, between, what, they, termed, a, quarantine, of, offensive, weapons, and, a, blockade, of, all, materials, claiming, that, a, classic, blockade, was, not, the, original, intention, since, it, would, take, place, in, international, waters, kennedy, obtained, the, approval, of, the, oas, for, military, action, under, the, hemispheric, defence, provisions, of, the, rio, treaty, latin, american, participation, in, the, quarantine, now, involved, two, argentine, destroyers, which, were, to, report, to, the, us, commander, south, atlantic, at, trinidad, on, november, 9, an, argentine, submarine, and, a, marine, battalion, with, lift, were, available, if, required, in, addition, two, venezuelan, destroyers, destroyers, arv, d, 11, nueva, esparta, and, arv, d, 21, zulia, and, one, submarine, caribe, had, reported, to, comsolant, ready, for, sea, by, november, 2, the, government, of, trinidad, and, tobago, offered, the, use, of, chaguaramas, naval, base, to, warships, of, any, oas, nation, for, the, duration, of, the, quarantine, the, dominican, republic, had, made, available, one, escort, ship, colombia, was, reported, ready, to, furnish, units, and, had, sent, military, officers, to, the, us, to, discuss, this, assistance, the, argentine, air, force, informally, offered, three, sa, 16, aircraft, in, addition, to, forces, already, committed, to, the, quarantine, operation, this, initially, was, to, involve, a, naval, blockade, against, offensive, weapons, within, the, framework, of, the, organization, of, american, states, and, the, rio, treaty, such, a, blockade, might, be, expanded, to, cover, all, types, of, goods, and, air, transport, the, action, was, to, be, backed, up, by, surveillance, of, cuba, the, cno, s, scenario, was, followed, closely, in, later, implementing, the, quarantine, on, 19, october, the, excomm, formed, separate, working, groups, to, examine, the, air, strike, and, blockade, options, and, by, the, afternoon, most, support, in, the, excomm, had, shifted, to, a, blockade, reservations, about, the, plan, continued, to, be, voiced, as, late, as, 21, october, the, paramount, concern, being, that, once, the, blockade, was, put, into, effect, the, soviets, would, rush, to, complete, some, of, the, missiles, consequently, the, us, could, find, itself, bombing, operational, missiles, if, the, blockade, did, not, force, khrushchev, to, remove, the, missiles, already, on, the, island, 99, 101, at, 3, 00, pm, edt, on, 22, october, president, kennedy, formally, established, the, executive, committee, excomm, with, national, security, action, memorandum, nsam, 196, at, 5, 00, pm, he, met, with, congressional, leaders, who, contentiously, opposed, a, blockade, and, demanded, a, stronger, response, in, moscow, us, ambassador, foy, d, kohler, briefed, khrushchev, on, the, pending, blockade, and, kennedy, s, speech, to, the, nation, ambassadors, around, the, world, gave, notice, to, non, eastern, bloc, leaders, before, the, speech, us, delegations, met, with, canadian, prime, minister, john, diefenbaker, british, prime, minister, harold, macmillan, west, german, chancellor, konrad, adenauer, french, president, charles, de, gaulle, and, secretary, general, of, the, organization, of, american, states, jos, antonio, mora, to, brief, them, on, this, intelligence, and, the, us, s, proposed, response, all, were, supportive, of, the, us, position, over, the, course, of, the, crisis, kennedy, had, daily, telephone, conversations, with, macmillan, who, was, publicly, supportive, of, us, actions, shortly, before, his, speech, kennedy, telephoned, former, president, dwight, eisenhower, kennedy, s, conversation, with, the, former, president, also, revealed, that, the, two, had, been, consulting, during, the, cuban, missile, crisis, the, two, also, anticipated, that, khrushchev, would, respond, to, the, western, world, in, a, manner, similar, to, his, response, during, the, suez, crisis, and, would, possibly, wind, up, trading, off, berlin, at, 7, 00, pm, edt, on, 22, october, kennedy, delivered, a, nationwide, televised, address, on, all, of, the, major, networks, announcing, the, discovery, of, the, missiles, he, noted, it, shall, be, the, policy, of, this, nation, to, regard, any, nuclear, missile, launched, from, cuba, against, any, nation, in, the, western, hemisphere, as, an, attack, by, the, soviet, union, on, the, united, states, requiring, a, full, retaliatory, response, upon, the, soviet, union, kennedy, described, the, administration, s, plan, to, halt, this, offensive, buildup, a, strict, quarantine, on, all, offensive, military, equipment, under, shipment, to, cuba, is, being, initiated, all, ships, of, any, kind, bound, for, cuba, from, whatever, nation, or, port, will, if, found, to, contain, cargoes, of, offensive, weapons, be, turned, back, this, quarantine, will, be, extended, if, needed, to, other, types, of, cargo, and, carriers, we, are, not, at, this, time, however, denying, the, necessities, of, life, as, the, soviets, attempted, to, do, in, their, berlin, blockade, of, 1948, during, the, speech, a, directive, went, out, to, all, us, forces, worldwide, placing,

ted, sorensen, stated, in, 2007, that, the, address, to, the, nation, was, kennedy, s, most, important, speech, historically, in, terms, of, its, impact, on, our, planet, at, 11, 24, am, edt, on, 24, october, a, cable, from, us, secretary, of, state, george, ball, to, the, us, ambassadors, in, turkey, and, nato, notified, them, that, they, were, considering, making, an, offer, to, withdraw, the, missiles, from, italy, and, turkey, in, exchange, for, the, soviet, withdrawal, from, cuba, turkish, officials, replied, that, they, would, deeply, resent, any, trade, involving, the, us, missile, presence, in, their, country, one, day, later, on, the, morning, of, 25, october, american, journalist, walter, lippmann, proposed, the, same, thing, in, his, syndicated, column, castro, reaffirmed, cuba, s, right, to, self, defense, and, said, that, all, of, its, weapons, were, defensive, and, cuba, would, not, allow, an, inspection, three, days, after, kennedy, s, speech, the, chinese, people, s, daily, announced, that, 650, 000, 000, chinese, men, and, women, were, standing, by, the, cuban, people, in, west, germany, newspapers, supported, the, us, response, by, contrasting, it, with, the, weak, american, actions, in, the, region, during, the, preceding, months, they, also, expressed, some, fear, that, the, soviets, might, retaliate, in, berlin, in, france, on, 23, october, the, crisis,

continued, unabated, and, on, the, evening, of, 24, october, the, soviet, tass, news, agency, broadcast, a, telegram, from, khrushchev, to, kennedy, in, which, khrushchev, warned, that, the, united,

present, situation, with, a, cool, head, without, giving, way, to, passion, you, will, understand, that, the, soviet, union, cannot, afford, not, to, decline, the, despotic, demands, of, the, usa, and, that, the, soviet, union, viewed, the, blockade, as, an, act, of, aggression, and, their, ships, would, be, instructed, to, ignore, it, after, 23, october, soviet, communications, with, the, usa, increasingly, showed, indications, of, having, been, rushed, undoubtedly, a, product, of, pressure, it, was, not, uncommon, for, khrushchev, to, repeat, himself, and, to, send, messages, lacking, basic, editing, with, president, kennedy, making, his, aggressive, intentions, of, a, possible, airstrike, followed, by, an, invasion, on, cuba, known, khrushchev, rapidly, sought, a, diplomatic,

at, all, in, response, kennedy, issued, security, action, memorandum, 199, authorizing, the, loading, of, nuclear, weapons, onto, aircraft, under, the, command, of, saceur, which, had, the, duty, of, carrying, out, first, air, strikes, on, the, soviet, union, kennedy, claimed, that, the, blockade, had, succeeded, when, the, ussr, turned, back, fourteen, ships, presumably, carrying, offensive, weapons, the, first, indication, of, this, came, from, a, report, from, the, british, gchq, sent, to, the, white, house, situation, room, containing, intercepted, communications, from, soviet, ships, reporting, their, positions, on, 24, october, kislovodsk, a, soviet, cargo, ship, reported, a, position, north, east, of, where, it, had, been, 24, hours, earlier, indicating, it, had, discontinued, its, voyage, and, turned, back, towards, the, baltic, the, next, day, reports, showed, more, ships, originally, bound, for, cuba, had, altered, their, course, the, next, morning, 26, october, kennedy, informed, the, excomm, that, he, believed, only, an, invasion, would, remove, the, missiles, from, cuba, he, was, persuaded, to, give, the, matter, time, and, continue, with, both, military, and, diplomatic, pressure, he, agreed, and, ordered, the, low, level, flights, over, the, island, to, be, increased, from, two, per, day, to, once, every, two, hours, he, also, ordered, a, crash, program, to, institute, a, new, civil, government, in, cuba, if, an, invasion, went, ahead, at, this, point, the, crisis, was, ostensibly, at, a, stalemate, the, soviets, had, shown, no, indication, that, they, would, back, down, and, had, made, public, media, and, private, inter, governmental, statements, to, that, effect, the, us, had, no, reason, to, believe, otherwise, and, was, in, the, early, stages, of, preparing, for, an, invasion, along, with, a, nuclear, strike, on, the, soviet, union, if, it, responded, militarily, which, the, us, assumed, it, would, kennedy, had, no, intention, of, keeping, these, plans, a, secret, with, an, array, of, cuban, and, soviet, spies, forever, present, khrushchev, was, quickly, made, aware, of, this, looming, danger, the, implicit, threat, of, air, strikes, on, cuba, followed, by, invasion, allowed, the, united, states, to, exert, pressure, in, future, talks, it, was, the, possibility, of, military, action, that, played, an, influential, role, in, accelerating, khrushchev, s, proposal, for, a, compromise, throughout, the, closing, stages, of, october, soviet, communications, to, the, united, states, indicated, increasing, defensiveness, khrushchev, s, increasing, tendency, to, use, poorly, phrased, and, ambiguous, communications, throughout, the, compromise, negotiations, conversely, increased, united, states, confidence, and, clarity, in, messaging, leading, soviet, figures, consistently, failed, to, mention, that, only, the, cuban, government, could, agree, to, inspections, of, the, territory, and, continually, made, arrangements, relating, to, cuba, without, the, knowledge, of, fidel, castro, himself, according, to, dean, rusk, khrushchev, blinked, he, began, to, panic, from, the, consequences, of, his, own, plan, and, this, was, reflected, in, the, tone, of, soviet, messages, this, allowed, the, us, to, largely, dominate, negotiations, in, late, october, the, escalating, situation, also, led, khrushchev, to, abandon, plans, for, a, potential, warsaw, pact, invasion, of, albania, which, was, being, discussed, in, the, eastern, bloc, following, the, vlora, incident, the, year, prior, at, 1, 00, pm, edt, on, 26, october, john, a, scali, of, abc, news, had, lunch, with, aleksandr, fomin, the, cover, name, of, alexander, feklisov, the, kgb, station, chief, in, washington, at, fomin, s, request, following, the, instructions, of, the, politburo, of, the, cpsu, fomin, noted, war, seems, about, to, break, out, he, asked, scali, to, use, his, contacts, to, talk, to, his, high, level, friends, at, the, state, department, to, see, if, the, us, would, be, interested, in, a, diplomatic, solution, he, suggested, that, the, language, of, the, deal, would, contain, an, assurance, from, the, soviet, union, to, remove, the, weapons, under, un, supervision, and, that, castro, would, publicly, announce, that, he, would, not, accept, such, weapons, again, in, exchange, for, a, public, statement, by, the, us, that, it, would, not, invade, cuba, the, us, responded, by, asking, the, brazilian, government, to, pass, a, message, to, castro, that, the, us, would, be, unlikely, to, invade, if, the, missiles, were, removed, mr, president, we, and, you, ought, not, now, to, pull, on, the, ends, of, the, rope, in, which, you, have, tied, the, knot, of, war, because, the, more, the, two, of, us, pull, the, tighter, that, knot, will, be, tied, and, a, moment, may, come, when, that, knot, will, be, tied, so, tight, that, even, he, who, tied, it, will, not, have, the, strength, to, untie, it, and, then, it, will, be, necessary, to, cut, that, knot, and, what, that, would, mean, is, not, for, me, to, explain, to, you, because, you, yourself, understand, perfectly, of, what, terrible, forces, our, countries, dispose, consequently, if, there, is, no, intention, to, tighten, that, knot, and, thereby, to, doom, the, world, to, the, catastrophe, of, thermonuclear, war, then, let, us, not, only, relax, the, forces, pulling, on, the, ends, of, the, rope, let, us, take, measures, to, untie, that, knot, we, are, ready, for, this, letter, from, chairman, khrushchev, to, president, kennedy, 26, october, 1962, at, 6, 00, pm, edt, on, 26, october, the, state, department, started, receiving, a, message, that, appeared, to, be, written, personally, by, khrushchev, it, was, saturday, 2, 00, am, in, moscow, the, long, letter, took, several, minutes, to, arrive, and, it, took, translators, additional, time, to, translate, and, transcribe, it, robert, f, kennedy, described, the, letter, as, very, long, and, emotional, khrushchev, reiterated, the, basic, outline, that, had, been, stated, to, scali, earlier, in, the, day, i, propose, we, for, our, part, will, declare, that, our, ships, bound, for, cuba, are, not, carrying, any, armaments, you, will, declare, that, the, united, states, will, not, invade, cuba, with, its, troops, and, will, not, support, any, other, forces, which, might, intend, to, invade, cuba, then, the, necessity, of, the, presence, of, our, military, specialists, in, cuba, will, disappear, at, 6, 45, pm, edt, news, of, fomin, s, offer, to, scali, was, finally, heard, and, was, interpreted, as, a, set, up, for, the, arrival, of, khrushchev, s, letter, the, letter, was, then, considered, official, and, accurate, although, it, was, later, learned, that, fomin, was, almost, certainly, operating, of, his, own, accord, without, official, backing, additional, study, of, the, letter, was, ordered, and, continued, into, the, night, direct, aggression, against, cuba, would, mean, nuclear, war, the, americans, speak, about, such, aggression, as, if, they, did, not, know, or, did, not, want, to, accept, this, fact, i, have, no, doubt, they, would, lose, such, a, war, castro, on, the, other, hand, was, convinced, that, an, invasion, of, cuba, was, soon, at, hand, and, on, 26, october, he, sent, a, telegram, to, khrushchev, that, appeared, to, call, for, a, pre, emptive, nuclear, strike, on, the, us, in, case, of, attack, in, a, 2010, interview, castro, expressed, regret, about, his, 1962, stance, on, first, use, after, i, ve, seen, what, i, ve, seen, and, knowing, what, i, know, now, it, wasn, t, worth, it, at, all, castro, also, ordered, all, anti, aircraft, weapons, in, cuba, to, fire, on, any, us, aircraft, previous, orders, had, been, to, fire, only, on, groups, of, two, or, more, at, 6, 00, am, edt, on, 27, october, the, cia, delivered, a, memo, reporting, that, three, of, the, four, missile, sites, at, san, cristobal, and, both, sites, at, sagua, la, grande, appeared, to, be, fully, operational, it, also, noted, that, the, cuban, military, continued, to, organise, for, action, but, was, under, order, not, to, initiate, action, unless, attacked, at, 9, 00, am, edt, on, 27, october, radio, moscow, began, broadcasting, a, message, from, khrushchev, contrary, to, the, letter, of, the, night, before, the, message, offered, a, new, trade, the, missiles, on, cuba, would, be, removed, in, exchange, for, the, removal, of, the, jupiter, missiles, from, italy, and, turkey, at, 10, 00, am, edt, the, executive, committee, met, again, to, discuss, the, situation, and, came, to, the, conclusion, that, the, change, in, the, message, was, because, of, internal, debate, between, khrushchev, and, other, party, officials, in, the, kremlin, 300, kennedy, realised, that, he, would, be, in, an, insupportable, position, if, this, becomes, khrushchev, s, proposal, because, the, missiles, in, turkey, were, not, militarily, useful, and, were, being, removed, anyway, and, it, s, gonna, to, any, man, at, the, united, nations, or, any, other, rational, man, it, will, look, like, a, very, fair, trade, bundy, explained, why, khrushchev, s, public, acquiescence, could, not, be, considered, the, current, threat, to, peace, is, not, in, turkey, it, is, in, cuba, mcnamara, noted, that, another, tanker, the, grozny, was, about, 600, miles, 970, km, out, and, should, be, intercepted, he, also, noted, that, they, had, not, made, the, soviets, aware, of, the, blockade, line, and, suggested, relaying, that, information, to, them, via, u, thant, at, the, united, nations, while, the, meeting, progressed, at, 11, 03, am, edt, a, new, message, began, to, arrive, from, khrushchev, the, message, stated, in, part, you, are, disturbed, over, cuba, you, say, that, this, disturbs, you, because, it, is, ninety, nine, miles, by, sea, from, the, coast, of, the, united, states, of, america, but, you, have, placed, destructive, missile, weapons, which, you, call, offensive, in, italy, and, turkey, literally, next, to, us, i, therefore, make, this, proposal, we, are, willing, to, remove, from, cuba, the, means, which, you, regard, as, offensive, your, representatives, will, make, a, declaration, to, the, effect, that, the, united, states, will, remove, its, analogous, means, from, turkey, and, after, that, persons, entrusted, by, the, united, nations, security, council, could, inspect, on, the, spot, the, fulfillment, of, the, pledges, made, the, executive, committee, continued, to, meet, through, the, day, throughout, the, crisis, turkey, had, repeatedly, stated, that, it, would, be, upset, if, the, jupiter, missiles, were, removed, italy, s, prime, minister, amintore, fanfani, who, was, also, foreign, minister, ad, interim, offered, to, allow, withdrawal, of, the, missiles, deployed, in, apulia, as, a, bargaining, chip, he, gave, the, message, to, one, of, his, most, trusted, friends, ettore, bernabei, general, manager, of, rai, tv, to, convey, to, arthur, m, schlesinger, jr, bernabei, was, in, new, york, to, attend, an, international, conference, on, satellite, tv, broadcasting, on, the, morning, of, 27, october, a, u, 2f, the, third, cia, u, 2a, modified, for, air, to, air, refuelling, piloted, by, usaf, major, rudolf, anderson, departed, its, forward, operating, location, at, mccoy, afb, florida, at, approximately, 12, 00, pm, edt, the, aircraft, was, struck, by, an, sa, 2, surface, to, air, missile, launched, from, cuba, the, aircraft, crashed, and, anderson, was, killed, stress, in, negotiations, between, the, soviets, and, the, us, intensified, only, later, was, it, assumed, that, the, decision, to, fire, the, missile, was, made, locally, by, an, undetermined, soviet, commander, acting, on, his, own, authority, later, that, day, at, about, 3, 41, pm, edt, several, us, navy, rf, 8a, crusader, aircraft, on, low, level, photo, reconnaissance, missions, were, fired, upon, at, 4, 00, pm, edt, kennedy, recalled, members, of, excomm, to, the, white, house, and, ordered, that, a, message, should, immediately, be, sent, to, u, thant, asking, the, soviets, to, suspend, work, on, the, missiles, while, negotiations, were, carried, out, during, the, meeting, general, maxwell, taylor, delivered, the, news, that, the, u, 2, had, been, shot, down, kennedy, had, earlier, claimed, he, would, order, an, attack, on, such, sites, if, fired, upon, but, he, decided, to, not, act, unless, another, attack, was, made, on, 28, october, 1962, khrushchev, told, his, son, sergei, that, the, shooting, down, of, anderson, s, u, 2, was, by, the, cuban, military, at, the, direction, of, ra, l, castro, forty, years, later, mcnamara, said, we, had, to, send, a, u, 2, over, to, gain, reconnaissance, information, on, whether, the, soviet, missiles, were, becoming, operational, we, believed, that, if, the, u, 2, was, shot, down, that, the, cubans, didn, t, have, capabilities, to, shoot, it, down, the, soviets, did, we, believed, if, it, was, shot, down, it, would, be, shot, down, by, a, soviet, surface, to, air, missile, unit, and, that, it, would, represent, a, decision, by, the, soviets, to, escalate, the, conflict, and, therefore, before, we, sent, the, u, 2, out, we, agreed, that, if, it, was, shot, down, we, wouldn, t, meet, we, d, simply, attack, it, was, shot, down, on, friday, fortunately, we, changed, our, mind, we, thought, well, it, might, have, been, an, accident, we, won, t, attack, later, we, learned, that, khrushchev, had, reasoned, just, as, we, did, we, send, over, the, u, 2, if, it, was, shot, down, he, reasoned, we, would, believe, it, was, an, intentional, escalation, and, therefore, he, issued, orders, to, pliyev, the, soviet, commander, in, cuba, to, instruct, all, of, his, batteries, not, to, shoot, down, the, u, 2, daniel, ellsberg, said, that, robert, kennedy, rfk, told, him, in, 1964, that, after, the, u, 2, was, shot, down, and, the, pilot, killed, he, rfk, told, soviet, ambassador, dobrynin, you, have, drawn, first, blood, he, president, had, decided, against, advice, not, to, respond, militarily, to, that, attack, but, he, should, know, that, if, another, plane, was, shot, at, we, would, take, out, all, the, sams, and, antiaircraft, and, that, would, almost, surely, be, followed, by, an, invasion, emissaries, sent, by, both, kennedy, and, khrushchev, agreed, to, meet, at, the, yenching, palace, chinese, restaurant, in, the, cleveland, park, neighbourhood, of, washington, dc, on, saturday, evening, 27, october, kennedy, suggested, to, take, khrushchev, s, offer, to, trade, away, the, missiles, unknown, to, most, members, of, the, excomm, but, with, the, support, of, his, brother, the, president, robert, kennedy, had, been, meeting, with, the, soviet, ambassador, dobrynin, in, washington, to, discover, whether, the, intentions, were, genuine, the, excomm, was, generally, against, the, proposal, because, it, would, undermine, nato, s, authority, and, the, turkish, government, had, repeatedly, stated, it, was, against, any, such, trade, as, the, meeting, progressed, a, new, plan, emerged, and, kennedy, was, slowly, persuaded, the, new, plan, called, for, him, to, ignore, the, latest, message, and, instead, to, return, to, khrushchev, s, earlier, one, kennedy, was, initially, hesitant, feeling, that, khrushchev, would, no, longer, accept, the, deal, because, a, new, one, had, been, offered, but, llewellyn, thompson, argued, that, it, was, still, possible, 135, 56, white, house, special, counsel, and, adviser, ted, sorensen, and, robert, kennedy, left, the, meeting, and, returned, 45, minutes, later, with, a, draft, letter, to, that, effect, the, president, made, several, changes, had, it, typed, and, sent, it, after, the, excomm, meeting, a, smaller, meeting, continued, in, the, oval, office, the, group, argued, that, the, letter, should, be, underscored, with, an, oral, message, to, dobrynin, that, stated, that, if, the, missiles, were, not, withdrawn, military, action, would, be, used, to, remove, them, rusk, added, one, proviso, that, no, part, of, the, language, of, the, deal, would, mention, turkey, but, there, would, be, an, understanding, that, the, missiles, would, be, removed, voluntarily, in, the, immediate, aftermath, the, president, agreed, and, the, message, was, sent, at, rusk, s, request, fomin, and, scali, met, again, scali, asked, why, the, two, letters, from, khrushchev, were, so, different, and, fomin, claimed, it, was, because, of, poor, communications, scali, replied, that, the, claim, was, not, credible, and, shouted, that, he, thought, it, was, a, stinking, double, cross, he, went, on, to, claim, that, an, invasion, was, only, hours, away, and, fomin, stated, that, a, response, to, the, us, message, was, expected, from, khrushchev, shortly, and, urged, scali, to, tell, the, state, department, that, no, treachery, was, intended, scali, said, that, he, did, not, think, anyone, would, believe, him, but, he, agreed, to, deliver, the, message, the, two, went, their, separate, ways, and, scali, immediately, typed, out, a, memo, for, the, excomm, within, the, us, establishment, it, was, well, understood, that, ignoring, the, second, offer, and, returning, to, the, first, put, khrushchev, in, a, terrible, position, military, preparations, continued, and, all, active, duty, air, force, personnel, were, recalled, to, their, bases, for, possible, action, robert, kennedy, later, recalled, the, mood, we, had, not, abandoned, all, hope, but, what, hope, there, was, now, rested, with, khrushchev, s, revising, his, course, within, the, next, few, hours, it, was, a, hope, not, an, expectation, the, expectation, was, military, confrontation, by, tuesday, and, possibly, tomorrow, at, 8, 05, pm, edt, the, letter, drafted, earlier, in, the, day, was, delivered, the, message, read, as, i, read, your, letter, the, key, elements, of, your, proposals, which, seem, generally, acceptable, as, i, understand, them, are, as, follows, 1, you, would, agree, to, remove, these, weapons, systems, from, cuba, under, appropriate, united, nations, observation, and, supervision, and, undertake, with, suitable, safe, guards, to, halt, the, further, introduction, of, such, weapon, systems, into, cuba, 2, we, on, our, part, would, agree, upon, the, establishment, of, adequate, arrangements, through, the, united, nations, to, ensure, the, carrying, out, and, continuation, of, these, commitments, a, to, remove, promptly, the, quarantine, measures, now, in, effect, and, b, to, give, assurances, against, the, invasion, of, cuba, the, letter, was, also, released, directly, to, the, press, to, ensure, it, could, not, be, delayed, with, the, letter, delivered, a, deal, was, on, the, table, as, robert, kennedy, noted, there, was, little, expectation, it, would, be, accepted, at, 9, 00, pm, edt, the, excomm, met, again, to, review, the, actions, for, the, following, day, plans, were, drawn, up, for, air, strikes, on, the, missile, sites, as, well, as, other, economic, targets, notably, petroleum, storage, mcnamara, stated, that, they, had, to, have, two, things, ready, a, government, for, cuba, because, we, re, going, to, need, one, and, secondly, plans, for, how, to, respond, to, the, soviet, union, in, europe, because, sure, as, hell, they, re, going, to, do, something, there, at, 12, 12, am, edt, on, 27, october, the, us, informed, its, nato, allies, that, the, situation, is, growing, shorter, the, united, states, may, find, it, necessary, within, a, very, short, time, in, its, interest, and, that, of, its, fellow, nations, in, the, western, hemisphere, to, take, whatever, military, action, may, be, necessary, to, add, to, the, concern, at, 6, 00, am, the, cia, reported, that, all, missiles, in, cuba, were, ready, for, action, on, 27, october, khrushchev, also, received, a, letter, from, castro, what, is, now, known, as, the, armageddon, letter, dated, the, day, before, which, was, interpreted, as, urging, the, use, of, nuclear, force, in, the, event, of, an, attack, on, cuba, i, believe, the, imperialists, aggressiveness, is, extremely, dangerous, and, if, they, actually, carry, out, the, brutal, act, of, invading, cuba, in, violation, of, international, law, and, morality, that, would, be, the, moment, to, eliminate, such, danger, forever, through, an, act, of, clear, legitimate, defense, however, harsh, and, terrible, the, solution, would, be, castro, wrote, later, that, same, day, what, the, white, house, later, called, black, saturday, the, us, navy, dropped, a, series, of, signalling, depth, charges, practice, depth, charges, the, size, of, hand, grenades, on, a, soviet, submarine, b, 59, at, the, blockade, line, unaware, that, it, was, armed, with, a, nuclear, tipped, torpedo, with, orders, that, allowed, it, to, be, used, if, the, submarine, was, damaged, by, depth, charges, or, surface, fire, as, the, submarine, was, too, deep, to, monitor, any, radio, traffic, the, captain, of, the, b, 59, valentin, grigoryevich, savitsky, assumed, after, live, ammunition, fire, at, his, submarine, that, a, war, had, already, started, and, wanted, to, launch, a, nuclear, torpedo, the, decision, to, launch, these, normally, only, required, the, agreement, of, the, ship, s, commanding, officer, and, political, officer, however, the, commander, of, the, submarine, flotilla, vasily, arkhipov, was, aboard, b, 59, and, so, he, also, had, to, agree, arkhipov, objected, and, so, the, nuclear, launch, was, narrowly, averted, these, events, only, publicly, became, known, in, 2002, see, submarine, close, call, on, the, same, day, a, u, 2, spy, plane, made, an, accidental, unauthorised, 90, minute, overflight, of, the, soviet, union, s, far, eastern, coast, the, soviets, responded, by, scrambling, mig, fighters, from, wrangel, island, in, turn, the, americans, launched, f, 102, fighters, armed, with, nuclear, air, to, air, missiles, over, the, bering, sea, on, saturday, 27, october, after, much, deliberation, between, the, soviet, union, and, kennedy, s, cabinet, kennedy, secretly, agreed, to, remove, all, missiles, set, in, turkey, and, possibly, southern, italy, the, former, on, the, border, of, the, soviet, union, in, exchange, for, khrushchev, removing, all, missiles, in, cuba, there, is, some, dispute, as, to, whether, removing, the, missiles, from, italy, was, part, of, the, secret, agreement, khrushchev, wrote, in, his, memoirs, that, it, was, and, when, the, crisis, had, ended, mcnamara, gave, the, order, to, dismantle, the, missiles, in, both, italy, and, turkey, at, this, point, khrushchev, knew, things, the, us, did, not, first, that, the, shooting, down, of, the, u, 2, by, a, soviet, missile, violated, direct, orders, from, moscow, and, cuban, anti, aircraft, fire, against, other, us, reconnaissance, aircraft, also, violated, direct, orders, from, khrushchev, to, castro, second, the, soviets, already, had, 162, nuclear, warheads, on, cuba, that, the, us, did, not, then, believe, were, there, third, the, soviets, and, cubans, on, the, island, would, almost, certainly, have, responded, to, an, invasion, by, using, those, nuclear, weapons, even, though, castro, believed, that, every, human, in, cuba, would, likely, die, as, a, result, khrushchev, also, knew, but, may, not, have, considered, the, fact, that, he, had, submarines, armed, with, nuclear, weapons, that, the, us, navy, may, not, have, known, about, khrushchev, knew, he, was, losing, control, president, kennedy, had, been, told, in, early, 1961, that, a, nuclear, war, would, likely, kill, a, third, of, humanity, with, most, or, all, of, those, deaths, concentrated, in, the, us, the, ussr, europe, and, china, khrushchev, may, well, have, received, similar, reports, from, his, military, with, this, background, when, khrushchev, heard, kennedy, s, threats, relayed, by, robert, kennedy, to, soviet, ambassador, dobrynin, he, immediately, drafted, his, acceptance, of, kennedy, s, latest, terms, from, his, dacha, without, involving, the, politburo, as, he, had, previously, and, had, them, immediately, broadcast, over, radio, moscow, which, he, believed, the, us, would, hear, in, that, broadcast, at, 9, 00, am, est, on, 28, october, khrushchev, stated, that, the, soviet, government, in, addition, to, previously, issued, instructions, on, the, cessation, of, further, work, at, the, building, sites, for, the, weapons, has, issued, a, new, order, on, the, dismantling, of, the, weapons, which, you, describe, as, offensive, and, their, crating, and, return, to, the, soviet, union, at, 10, 00, am, on, 28, october, kennedy, first, learned, of, khrushchev, s, solution, to, the, crisis, with, the, us, removing, the, 15, jupiters, in, turkey, and, the, soviets, would, remove, the, rockets, from, cuba, khrushchev, had, made, the, offer, in, a, public, statement, for, the, world, to, hear, despite, almost, solid, opposition, from, his, senior, advisers, kennedy, quickly, embraced, the, soviet, offer, this, is, a, pretty, good, play, of, his, kennedy, said, according, to, a, tape, recording, that, he, made, secretly, of, the, cabinet, room, meeting, kennedy, had, deployed, the, jupiters, in, march, 1962, causing, a, stream, of, angry, outbursts, from, khrushchev, most, people, will, think, this, is, a, rather, even, trade, and, we, ought, to, take, advantage, of, it, kennedy, said, vice, president, lyndon, johnson, was, the, first, to, endorse, the, missile, swap, but, others, continued, to, oppose, the, offer, finally, kennedy, ended, the, debate, we, can, t, very, well, invade, cuba, with, all, its, toil, and, blood, kennedy, said, when, we, could, have, gotten, them, out, by, making, a, deal, on, the, same, missiles, on, turkey, if, that, s, part, of, the, record, then, you, don, t, have, a, very, good, war, kennedy, immediately, responded, to, khrushchev, s, letter, issuing, a, statement, calling, it, an, important, and, constructive, contribution, to, peace, he, continued, this, with, a, formal, letter, i, consider, my, letter, to, you, of, october, twenty, seventh, and, your, reply, of, today, as, firm, undertakings, on, the, part, of, both, our, governments, which, should, be, promptly, carried, out, the, us, will, make, a, statement, in, the, framework, of, the, security, council, in, reference, to, cuba, as, follows, it, will, declare, that, the, united, states, of, america, will, respect, the, inviolability, of, cuban, borders, its, sovereignty, that, it, take, the, pledge, not, to, interfere, in, internal, affairs, not, to, intrude, themselves, and, not, to, permit, our, territory, to, be, used, as, a, bridgehead, for, the, invasion, of, cuba, and, will, restrain, those, who, would, plan, to, carry, an, aggression, against, cuba, either, from, us, territory, or, from, the, territory, of, other, countries, neighboring, to, cuba, 103, kennedy, s, planned, statement, would, also, contain, suggestions, he, had, received, from, his, adviser, arthur, schlesinger, jr, in, a, memorandum, for, the, president, describing, the, post, mortem, on, cuba, on, 28, october, kennedy, participated, in, telephone, conversations, with, eisenhower, and, fellow, former, us, president, harry, truman, in, these, calls, kennedy, revealed, that, he, thought, the, crisis, would, result, in, the, two, superpowers, being, toe, to, toe, in, berlin, by, the, end, of, the, following, month, and, expressed, concern, that, the, soviet, setback, in, cuba, would, make, things, tougher, there, he, also, informed, his, predecessors, that, he, had, rejected, the, public, soviet, offer, to, withdraw, from, cuba, in, exchange, for, the, withdrawal, of, us, missiles, from, turkey, the, us, continued, the, blockade, in, the, following, days, aerial, reconnaissance, proved, that, the, soviets, were, making, progress, in, removing, the, missile, systems, the, 42, missiles, and, their, support, equipment, were, loaded, onto, eight, soviet, ships, on, 2, november, 1962, kennedy, addressed, the, us, via, radio, and, television, broadcasts, regarding, the, dismantlement, process, of, the, soviet, r, 12, missile, bases, located, in, the, caribbean, region, the, ships, left, cuba, on, november, 5, to, 9, the, us, made, a, final, visual, check, as, each, of, the, ships, passed, the, blockade, line, further, diplomatic, efforts, were, required, to, remove, the, soviet, il, 28, bombers, and, they, were, loaded, on, three, soviet, ships, on, 5, and, 6, december, concurrent, with, the, soviet, commitment, on, the, il, 28s, the, us, government, announced, the, end, of, the, blockade, from, 6, 45, pm, est, on, 20, november, 1962, at, the, time, when, the, kennedy, administration, thought, that, the, cuban, missile, crisis, was, resolved, nuclear, tactical, rockets, stayed, in, cuba, since, they, were, not, part, of, the, kennedy, khrushchev, understandings, and, the, americans, did, not, know, about, them, the, soviets, changed, their, minds, fearing, possible, future, cuban, militant, steps, and, on, 22, november, 1962, deputy, premier, of, the, soviet, union, anastas, mikoyan, told, castro, that, the, rockets, with, the, nuclear, warheads, were, being, removed, as, well, the, cuban, missile, crisis, was, solved, in, part, by, a, secret, agreement, between, john, f, kennedy, and, nikita, khrushchev, the, kennedy, khrushchev, pact, was, known, to, only, 9, us, officials, at, the, time, of, its, creation, in, october, 1963, and, was, first, officially, acknowledged, at, a, conference, in, moscow, in, january, 1989, by, soviet, ambassador, anatoly, dobrynin, and, kennedy, s, speechwriter, theodore, sorensen, in, his, negotiations, with, dobrynin, robert, kennedy, informally, proposed, that, the, jupiter, missiles, in, turkey, would, be, removed, within, a, short, time, after, this, crisis, was, over, 222, under, an, operation, code, named, operation, pot, pie, the, removal, of, the, jupiters, from, italy, and, turkey, began, on, 1, april, and, was, completed, by, 24, april, 1963, the, initial, plans, were, to, recycle, the, missiles, for, use, in, other, programs, but, nasa, and, the, usaf, were, not, interested, in, retaining, the, missile, hardware, the, missile, bodies, were, destroyed, on, site, while, warheads, guidance, packages, and, launching, equipment, worth, 14, million, were, returned, to, the, united, states, the, dismantling, operations, were, named, pot, pie, i, for, italy, and, pot, pie, ii, for, turkey, by, the, united, states, air, force, the, practical, effect, of, the, kennedy, khrushchev, pact, was, that, the, us, would, remove, their, rockets, from, italy, and, turkey, and, that, the, soviets, had, no, intention, of, resorting, to, nuclear, war, if, they, were, out, gunned, by, the, us, because, the, withdrawal, of, the, jupiter, missiles, from, nato, bases, in, italy, and, turkey, was, not, made, public, at, the, time, khrushchev, appeared, to, have, lost, the, conflict, and, become, weakened, the, perception, was, that, kennedy, had, won, the, contest, between, the, superpowers, and, that, khrushchev, had, been, humiliated, both, kennedy, and, khrushchev, took, every, step, to, avoid, full, conflict, despite, pressures, from, their, respective, governments, khrushchev, held, power, for, another, two, years, 102, 105, as, a, direct, result, of, the, crisis, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, set, up, a, direct, line, of, communication, the, hotline, between, the, soviet, union, and, the, united, states, was, a, way, for, the, president, and, the, premier, to, have, negotiations, should, a, crisis, like, this, ever, happen, again, by, the, time, of, the, crisis, in, october, 1962, the, total, number, of, nuclear, weapons, in, the, stockpiles, of, each, country, numbered, approximately, 26, 400, for, the, united, states, and, 3, 300, for, the, soviet, union, for, the, us, around, 3, 500, with, a, combined, yield, of, approximately, 6, 300, megatons, would, have, been, used, in, attacking, the, soviet, union, the, soviets, had, considerably, less, strategic, firepower, at, their, disposal, some, 300, 320, bombs, and, warheads, without, submarine, based, weapons, in, a, position, to, threaten, the, us, mainland, and, most, of, their, intercontinental, delivery, systems, based, on, bombers, that, would, have, difficulty, penetrating, north, american, air, defence, systems, however, they, had, already, moved, 158, warheads, to, cuba, between, 95, and, 100, would, have, been, ready, for, use, if, the, us, had, invaded, cuba, most, of, which, were, short, ranged, the, us, had, approximately, 4, 375, nuclear, weapons, deployed, in, europe, most, of, which, were, tactical, weapons, such, as, nuclear, artillery, with, around, 450, of, them, for, ballistic, missiles, cruise, missiles, and, aircraft, the, soviets, had, more, than, 550, similar, weapons, in, europe, cuba, perceived, the, outcome, as, a, betrayal, by, the, soviets, as, decisions, on, how, to, resolve, the, crisis, had, been, made, exclusively, by, kennedy, and, khrushchev, castro, was, especially, upset, that, certain, issues, of, interest, to, cuba, such, as, the, status, of, the, us, naval, base, in, guant, namo, were, not, addressed, that, caused, cuban, soviet, relations, to, deteriorate, for, years, to, come, 278, historian, arthur, schlesinger, believed, that, when, the, missiles, were, withdrawn, castro, was, more, angry, with, khrushchev, than, with, kennedy, because, khrushchev, had, not, consulted, castro, before, deciding, to, remove, them, although, castro, was, infuriated, by, khrushchev, he, planned, on, striking, the, us, with, the, remaining, missiles, if, an, invasion, of, the, island, occurred, 311, a, few, weeks, after, the, crisis, during, an, interview, with, the, british, communist, newspaper, the, daily, worker, guevara, was, still, fuming, over, the, perceived, soviet, betrayal, and, told, correspondent, sam, russell, that, if, the, missiles, had, been, under, cuban, control, they, would, have, fired, them, off, while, expounding, on, the, incident, later, guevara, reiterated, that, the, cause, of, socialist, liberation, against, global, imperialist, aggression, would, ultimately, have, been, worth, the, possibility, of, millions, of, atomic, war, victims, the, missile, crisis, further, convinced, guevara, that, the, world, s, two, superpowers, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, used, cuba, as, a, pawn, in, their, own, global, strategies, afterward, he, denounced, the, soviets, almost, as, frequently, as, he, denounced, the, americans, during, the, crisis, gheorghe, gheorghiu, dej, general, secretary, of, romania, s, communist, party, sent, a, letter, to, president, kennedy, dissociating, romania, from, soviet, actions, this, convinced, the, american, administration, of, bucharest, s, intentions, of, detaching, itself, from, moscow, the, significance, of, how, close, the, world, came, to, thermonuclear, war, impelled, khrushchev, to, propose, a, far, reaching, easing, of, tensions, with, the, us, in, a, letter, to, president, kennedy, dated, 30, october, 1962, khrushchev, outlined, a, range, of, bold, initiatives, to, forestall, the, possibility, of, a, further, nuclear, crisis, including, proposing, a, non, aggression, treaty, between, the, north, atlantic, treaty, organization, nato, and, the, warsaw, pact, or, even, disbanding, these, military, blocs, a, treaty, to, cease, all, nuclear, weapons, testing, and, even, the, elimination, of, all, nuclear, weapons, resolution, of, the, hot, button, issue, of, germany, by, both, east, and, west, formally, accepting, the, existence, of, west, germany, and, east, germany, and, us, recognition, of, the, government, of, mainland, china, the, letter, invited, counter, proposals, and, further, exploration, of, these, and, other, issues, through, peaceful, negotiations, khrushchev, invited, norman, cousins, the, editor, of, a, major, us, periodical, and, an, anti, nuclear, weapons, activist, to, serve, as, liaison, with, president, kennedy, and, cousins, met, with, khrushchev, for, four, hours, in, december, 1962, kennedy, s, response, to, khrushchev, s, proposals, was, lukewarm, but, kennedy, expressed, to, cousins, that, he, felt, constrained, in, exploring, these, issues, due, to, pressure, from, hardliners, in, the, us, national, security, apparatus, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, did, shortly, thereafter, agree, on, a, treaty, banning, atmospheric, testing, of, nuclear, weapons, known, as, the, partial, nuclear, test, ban, treaty, further, after, the, crisis, the, us, and, the, ussr, created, the, moscow, washington, hotline, a, direct, communications, link, between, moscow, and, washington, the, purpose, was, to, have, a, way, that, the, leaders, of, the, two, cold, war, countries, could, communicate, directly, to, solve, such, a, crisis, the, compromise, embarrassed, khrushchev, and, the, soviet, union, because, the, withdrawal, of, us, missiles, from, italy, and, turkey, was, a, secret, deal, between, kennedy, and, khrushchev, khrushchev, went, to, kennedy, as, he, thought, that, the, crisis, was, getting, out, of, hand, but, the, soviets, were, seen, as, retreating, from, circumstances, that, they, had, started, khrushchev, s, fall, from, power, two, years, later, was, in, part, because, of, the, soviet, politburo, s, embarrassment, at, both, khrushchev, s, eventual, concessions, to, the, us, and, this, ineptitude, in, precipitating, the, crisis, in, the, first, place, according, to, dobrynin, the, top, soviet, leadership, took, the, cuban, outcome, as, a, blow, to, its, prestige, bordering, on, humiliation, the, worldwide, us, forces, defcon, 3, status, was, returned, to, defcon, 4, on, 20, november, 1962, general, curtis, lemay, told, the, president, that, the, resolution, of, the, crisis, was, the, greatest, defeat, in, our, history, his, was, a, minority, position, he, had, pressed, for, an, immediate, invasion, of, cuba, as, soon, as, the, crisis, began, and, still, favored, invading, cuba, even, after, the, soviets, had, withdrawn, their, missiles, twenty, five, years, later, lemay, still, believed, that, we, could, have, gotten, not, only, the, missiles, out, of, cuba, we, could, have, gotten, the, communists, out, of, cuba, at, that, time, by, 1962, president, kennedy, had, faced, four, crisis, situations, the, failure, of, the, bay, of, pigs, invasion, settlement, negotiations, between, the, pro, western, government, of, laos, and, the, pathet, lao, communist, movement, kennedy, sidestepped, laos, whose, rugged, terrain, was, no, battleground, for, american, soldiers, 265, the, construction, of, the, berlin, wall, and, the, cuban, missile, crisis, kennedy, believed, that, yet, another, failure, to, gain, control, and, stop, communist, expansion, would, irreparably, damage, us, credibility, he, was, determined, to, draw, a, line, in, the, sand, and, prevent, a, communist, victory, in, vietnam, he, told, james, reston, of, the, new, york, times, immediately, after, his, vienna, summit, meeting, with, khrushchev, now, we, have, a, problem, making, our, power, credible, and, vietnam, looks, like, the, place, at, least, four, contingency, strikes, were, armed, and, launched, from, florida, against, cuban, airfields, and, suspected, missile, sites, in, 1963, and, 1964, although, all, were, diverted, to, the, pinecastle, range, complex, after, the, planes, passed, andros, island, critics, including, seymour, melman, and, seymour, hersh, suggested, that, the, cuban, missile, crisis, encouraged, the, united, states, use, of, military, means, such, as, the, case, in, the, later, vietnam, war, similarly, lorraine, bayard, de, volo, has, suggested, that, the, masculine, brinksmanship, of, the, cuban, missile, crisis, has, become, a, touchstone, of, toughness, by, which, presidents, are, measured, actions, in, 1962, would, go, on, to, have, a, significant, influence, on, the, future, policy, decisions, of, those, who, occupied, the, white, house, leading, to, foreign, policy, decisions, such, as, president, lyndon, b, johnson, s, escalation, of, the, war, in, vietnam, three, years, following, the, crisis, u, 2, pilot, anderson, s, body, was, returned, to, the, us, and, was, buried, with, full, military, honours, in, south, carolina, he, was, the, first, recipient, of, the, newly, created, air, force, cross, which, was, awarded, posthumously, although, anderson, was, the, only, combatant, fatality, during, the, crisis, 11, crew, members, of, three, reconnaissance, boeing, rb, 47, stratojets, of, the, 55th, strategic, reconnaissance, wing, were, also, killed, in, crashes, during, the, period, between, 27, september, and, 11, november, 1962, seven, crew, died, when, a, military, air, transport, service, boeing, c, 135b, stratolifter, delivering, ammunition, to, guantanamo, bay, naval, base, stalled, and, crashed, on, approach, on, 23, october, arguably, the, most, dangerous, moment, in, the, crisis, was, not, recognized, until, the, cuban, missile, crisis, havana, conference, in, october, 2002, marking, the, 40th, anniversary, of, the, crisis, a, three, day, conference, sponsored, by, the, private, national, security, archive, brown, university, and, the, cuban, government, attended, by, many, of, the, veterans, of, the, crisis, they, all, learned, that, on, 27, october, 1962, a, group, of, eleven, united, states, navy, destroyers, and, the, aircraft, carrier, uss, randolph, located, the, b, 59, a, diesel, powered, nuclear, armed, soviet, project, 641, nato, designation, foxtrot, submarine, near, cuba, despite, being, in, international, waters, the, americans, started, dropping, depth, charges, there, had, been, no, contact, from, moscow, for, a, number, of, days, and, the, submarine, was, too, deep, to, monitor, any, radio, traffic, so, those, on, board, did, not, know, whether, war, had, broken, out, the, captain, of, the, submarine, valentin, savitsky, had, no, way, of, knowing, that, the, depth, charges, were, non, lethal, practice, rounds, intended, as, warning, shots, to, force, the, b, 59, to, surface, running, out, of, air, the, soviet, submarine, was, surrounded, by, american, warships, and, desperately, needed, to, surface, while, surfacing, the, b, 59, came, under, machine, gun, fire, from, tracker, aircraft, the, fire, rounds, landed, either, to, the, sides, of, the, submarine, s, hull, or, near, the, bow, all, these, provocative, actions, carried, out, by, surface, ships, in, immediate, proximity, and, asw, aircraft, flying, some, 10, to, 15, meters, above, the, boat, had, a, detrimental, impact, on, the, commander, prompting, him, to, take, extreme, measures, the, use, of, special, weapons, as, firing, live, ammunition, at, a, submarine, was, strictly, prohibited, captain, savitsky, assumed, that, his, submarine, was, doomed, and, that, world, war, iii, already, had, broken, out, the, americans, for, their, part, did, not, know, that, the, b, 59, was, armed, with, a, 15, kiloton, nuclear, torpedo, roughly, the, power, of, the, bomb, at, hiroshima, the, uss, beale, was, joined, by, other, us, destroyers, who, piled, in, to, pummel, the, submerged, b, 59, with, more, explosives, captain, savitsky, ordered, the, b, 59, s, nuclear, torpedo, to, be, prepared, for, firing, its, target, was, the, uss, randolph, the, aircraft, carrier, leading, the, task, force, an, argument, broke, out, in, the, sweltering, control, room, of, the, b, 59, submarine, among, the, three, officers, including, submarine, captain, savitsky, political, officer, ivan, semyonovich, maslennikov, and, deputy, brigade, commander, captain, 2nd, rank, us, navy, commander, rank, equivalent, vasily, arkhipov, accounts, differ, about, whether, arkhipov, convinced, savitsky, not, to, make, the, attack, or, whether, savitsky, himself, finally, concluded, that, the, only, reasonable, choice, left, open, to, him, was, to, come, to, the, surface, 303, 317, the, decision, to, launch, the, b, 59, s, nuclear, torpedo, required, the, consent, of, all, three, senior, officers, aboard, the, young, officer, vasily, arkhipov, was, alone, in, refusing, permission, arkhipov, s, reputation, was, a, key, factor, in, the, control, room, debate, the, previous, year, he, had, exposed, himself, to, severe, radiation, in, order, to, save, a, submarine, with, an, overheating, nuclear, reactor, during, the, conference, october, 2002, mcnamara, stated, that, nuclear, war, had, come, much, closer, than, people, had, thought, thomas, blanton, director, of, the, national, security, archive, said, a, guy, called, vasily, arkhipov, saved, the, world, in, early, 1992, it, was, confirmed, that, soviet, forces, in, cuba, had, already, received, tactical, nuclear, warheads, for, their, artillery, rockets, and, il, 28, bombers, when, the, crisis, broke, castro, stated, that, he, would, have, recommended, their, use, if, the, us, invaded, despite, cuba, being, destroyed, fifty, years, after, the, crisis, graham, allison, wrote, fifty, years, ago, the, cuban, missile, crisis, brought, the, world, to, the, brink, of, nuclear, disaster, during, the, standoff, us, president, john, f, kennedy, thought, the, chance, of, escalation, to, war, was, between, 1, in, 3, and, even, and, what, we, have, learned, in, later, decades, has, done, nothing, to, lengthen, those, odds, we, now, know, for, example, that, in, addition, to, nuclear, armed, ballistic, missiles, the, soviet, union, had, deployed, 100, tactical, nuclear, weapons, to, cuba, and, the, local, soviet, commander, there, could, have, launched, these, weapons, without, additional, codes, or, commands, from, moscow, the, us, air, strike, and, invasion, that, were, scheduled, for, the, third, week, of, the, confrontation, would, likely, have, triggered, a, nuclear, response, against, american, ships, and, troops, and, perhaps, even, miami, the, resulting, war, might, have, led, to, the, deaths, of, over, 100, million, americans, and, over, 100, million, russians, bbc, journalist, joe, matthews, published, the, story, on, 13, october, 2012, behind, the, 100, tactical, nuclear, warheads, mentioned, by, graham, allison, in, the, excerpt, above, khrushchev, feared, that, castro, s, hurt, pride, and, widespread, cuban, indignation, over, the, concessions, he, had, made, to, kennedy, might, lead, to, a, breakdown, of, the, agreement, between, the, soviet, union, and, the, united, states, to, prevent, that, khrushchev, decided, to, offer, to, give, cuba, more, than, 100, tactical, nuclear, weapons, that, had, been, shipped, to, cuba, along, with, the, long, range, missiles, but, crucially, had, escaped, the, notice, of, us, intelligence, khrushchev, determined, that, because, the, americans, had, not, listed, the, missiles, on, their, list, of, demands, keeping, them, in, cuba, would, be, in, the, soviet, union, s, interests, anastas, mikoyan, was, tasked, with, the, negotiations, with, castro, over, the, missile, transfer, deal, that, was, designed, to, prevent, a, breakdown, in, the, relations, between, cuba, and, the, soviet, union, while, in, havana, mikoyan, witnessed, the, mood, swings, and, paranoia, of, castro, who, was, convinced, that, moscow, had, made, the, agreement, with, the, us, at, the, expense, of, cuba, s, defence, mikoyan, on, his, own, initiative, decided, that, castro, and, his, military, should, not, be, given, control, of, weapons, with, an, explosive, force, equal, to, 100, hiroshima, sized, bombs, under, any, circumstances, he, defused, the, seemingly, intractable, situation, which, risked, re, escalating, the, crisis, on, 22, november, 1962, during, a, tense, four, hour, meeting, mikoyan, convinced, castro, that, despite, moscow, s, desire, to, help, it, would, be, in, breach, of, an, unpublished, soviet, law, which, did, not, actually, exist, to, transfer, the, missiles, permanently, into, cuban, hands, and, provide, them, with, an, independent, nuclear, deterrent, castro, was, forced, to, give, way, and, much, to, the, relief, of, khrushchev, and, the, rest, of, the, soviet, government, the, tactical, nuclear, weapons, were, crated, and, returned, by, sea, to, the, soviet, union, during, december, 1962, the, american, popular, media, especially, television, made, frequent, use, of, the, events, of, the, missile, crisis, in, both, fictional, and, documentary, forms, jim, willis, includes, the, crisis, as, one, of, the, 100, media, moments, that, changed, america, sheldon, stern, finds, that, a, half, century, later, there, are, still, many, misconceptions, half, truths, and, outright, lies, that, have, shaped, media, versions, of, what, happened, in, the, white, house, during, those, harrowing, two, weeks, historian, william, cohn, argued, in, a, 1976, article, that, television, programs, are, typically, the, main, source, used, by, the, american, public, to, know, about, and, interpret, the, past, according, to, cold, war, historian, andrei, kozovoi, the, soviet, media, proved, somewhat, disorganized, as, it, was, unable, to, generate, a, coherent, popular, history, khrushchev, lost, power, and, was, airbrushed, out, of, the, story, cuba, was, no, longer, portrayed, as, a, heroic, david, against, the, american, goliath, one, contradiction, that, pervaded, the, soviet, media, campaign, was, between, the, pacifistic, rhetoric, of, the, peace, movement, that, emphasizes, the, horrors, of, nuclear, war, and, the, militancy, of, the, need, to, prepare, soviets, for, war, against, american, aggression
