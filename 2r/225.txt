the, mississippian, culture, was, a, native, american, civilization, that, flourished, in, what, is, now, the, midwestern, eastern, and, southeastern, united, states, from, approximately, 800, to, 1600, varying, regionally, it, was, known, for, building, large, earthen, platform, mounds, and, often, other, shaped, mounds, as, well, it, was, composed, of, a, series, of, urban, settlements, and, satellite, villages, linked, together, by, loose, trading, networks, the, largest, city, was, cahokia, believed, to, be, a, major, religious, center, located, in, what, is, present, day, southern, illinois, the, mississippian, way, of, life, began, to, develop, in, the, mississippi, river, valley, for, which, it, is, named, cultures, in, the, tributary, tennessee, river, valley, may, have, also, begun, to, develop, mississippian, characteristics, at, this, point, almost, all, dated, mississippian, sites, predate, 1539, 1540, when, hernando, de, soto, explored, the, area, with, notable, exceptions, being, natchez, communities, these, maintained, mississippian, cultural, practices, into, the, 18th, century, a, number, of, cultural, traits, are, recognized, as, being, characteristic, of, the, mississippians, although, not, all, mississippian, peoples, practiced, all, of, the, following, activities, they, were, distinct, from, their, ancestors, in, the, adoption, of, some, or, all, of, these, traits, the, mississippians, had, no, writing, system, or, stone, architecture, they, worked, naturally, occurring, metal, deposits, such, as, hammering, and, annealing, copper, for, ritual, objects, such, as, mississippian, copper, plates, and, other, decorations, but, did, not, smelt, iron, or, practice, bronze, metallurgy, the, mississippian, stage, is, usually, divided, into, three, or, more, chronological, periods, each, period, is, an, arbitrary, historical, distinction, varying, regionally, at, a, particular, site, each, period, may, be, considered, to, begin, earlier, or, later, depending, on, the, speed, of, adoption, or, development, of, given, mississippian, traits, the, mississippian, period, should, not, be, confused, with, the, mississippian, culture, the, mississippian, period, is, the, chronological, stage, while, mississippian, culture, refers, to, the, cultural, similarities, that, characterize, this, society, the, term, middle, mississippian, is, also, used, to, describe, the, core, of, the, classic, mississippian, culture, area, this, area, covers, the, central, mississippi, river, valley, the, lower, ohio, river, valley, and, most, of, the, mid, south, area, including, western, and, central, kentucky, western, tennessee, and, northern, alabama, and, mississippi, sites, in, this, area, often, contain, large, ceremonial, platform, mounds, residential, complexes, and, are, often, encircled, by, earthen, ditches, and, ramparts, or, palisades, middle, mississippian, cultures, especially, the, cahokia, polity, located, near, east, st, louis, illinois, were, very, influential, on, neighboring, societies, high, status, artifacts, including, stone, statuary, and, elite, pottery, associated, with, cahokia, have, been, found, far, outside, of, the, middle, mississippian, area, these, items, especially, the, pottery, were, also, copied, by, local, artists, the, term, south, appalachian, province, was, originally, used, by, w, h, holmes, in, 1903, to, describe, a, regional, ceramic, style, in, the, southeast, involving, surface, decorations, applied, with, a, carved, wooden, paddle, by, the, late, 1960s, archaeological, investigations, had, shown, the, similarity, of, the, culture, that, produced, the, pottery, and, the, midwestern, mississippian, pattern, defined, in, 1937, by, the, midwestern, taxonomic, system, in, 1967, james, b, griffin, coined, south, appalachian, mississippian, to, describe, the, evolving, understanding, of, the, peoples, of, the, southeast, south, appalachian, mississippian, area, sites, are, distributed, across, a, contiguous, area, including, alabama, georgia, northern, florida, south, carolina, central, and, western, north, carolina, and, tennessee, chronologically, this, area, became, influenced, by, mississippian, culture, later, than, the, middle, mississippian, area, about, 1000, as, compared, to, 800, to, its, northwest, it, is, believed, that, the, peoples, of, this, area, adopted, mississippian, traits, from, their, northwestern, neighbors, typical, settlements, were, located, on, riverine, floodplains, and, included, villages, with, defensive, palisades, enclosing, platform, mounds, and, residential, areas, etowah, and, ocmulgee, in, georgia, are, both, prominent, examples, of, major, south, appalachian, mississippian, settlements, both, include, multiple, large, earthwork, mounds, serving, a, variety, of, functions, villages, with, single, platform, mounds, were, more, typical, of, the, river, valley, settlements, throughout, the, mountainous, area, of, southwest, north, and, south, carolina, and, southeastern, tennessee, that, were, known, as, the, historic, cherokee, homelands, in, western, north, carolina, for, example, some, 50, such, mound, sites, in, the, eleven, westernmost, counties, have, been, identified, since, the, late, 20th, century, following, increased, research, in, this, area, of, the, cherokee, homeland, the, caddoan, mississippian, area, a, regional, variant, of, the, mississippian, culture, covered, a, large, territory, including, what, is, now, eastern, oklahoma, western, arkansas, northeastern, texas, and, northwestern, louisiana, archaeological, evidence, has, led, to, a, scholarly, consensus, that, the, cultural, continuity, is, unbroken, from, prehistory, to, the, present, and, that, the, caddo, and, related, caddo, language, speakers, in, prehistoric, times, and, at, first, european, contact, are, the, direct, ancestors, of, the, modern, caddo, nation, of, oklahoma, the, climate, in, this, area, was, drier, than, areas, in, the, eastern, woodlands, hindering, maize, production, and, the, lower, population, on, the, plains, to, the, west, may, have, meant, fewer, neighboring, competing, chiefdoms, to, contend, with, major, sites, such, as, spiro, and, the, battle, mound, site, are, in, the, arkansas, river, and, red, river, valleys, the, largest, and, most, fertile, of, the, waterways, in, the, caddoan, region, where, maize, agriculture, would, have, been, the, most, productive, the, sites, generally, lacked, wooden, palisade, fortifications, often, found, in, the, major, middle, mississippian, towns, living, on, the, western, edge, of, the, mississippian, world, the, caddoans, may, have, faced, fewer, military, threats, from, their, neighbors, their, societies, may, also, have, had, a, somewhat, lower, level, of, social, stratification, the, caddoan, people, were, speakers, of, one, of, the, many, caddoan, languages, these, languages, once, had, a, broad, geographic, distribution, but, many, are, now, extinct, the, modern, languages, in, the, caddoan, family, include, caddo, and, pawnee, hernando, de, soto, led, an, expedition, into, the, area, in, the, early, 1540s, he, encountered, several, native, groups, now, thought, to, have, been, caddoan, composed, of, many, tribes, the, caddo, were, organized, into, three, confederacies, the, hasinai, kadohadacho, and, natchitoches, which, were, all, linked, by, their, similar, languages, the, plaquemine, culture, was, an, archaeological, culture, in, the, lower, mississippi, river, valley, in, western, mississippi, and, eastern, louisiana, good, examples, of, this, culture, are, the, medora, site, the, type, site, for, the, culture, and, period, in, west, baton, rouge, parish, louisiana, and, the, anna, emerald, mound, winterville, and, holly, bluff, sites, located, in, mississippi, plaquemine, culture, was, contemporaneous, with, the, middle, mississippian, culture, at, the, cahokia, site, near, st, louis, missouri, it, is, considered, ancestral, to, the, natchez, and, taensa, peoples, although, the, mississippian, culture, was, heavily, disrupted, before, a, complete, understanding, of, the, political, landscape, was, written, down, many, mississippian, political, bodies, were, documented, and, others, have, been, discovered, by, research, mississippian, peoples, were, ancestral, to, the, majority, of, the, american, indian, nations, living, in, this, region, when, european, trade, began, the, historic, and, modern, day, american, indian, nations, believed, to, have, descended, from, the, overarching, mississippian, culture, include, the, alabama, apalachee, arikara, caddo, chickasaw, catawba, choctaw, muscogee, creek, guale, hitchiti, ho, chunk, houma, iowa, kansa, koroas, missouria, mobilian, natchez, omaha, osage, possibly, otoe, pawnee, ponca, quapaw, possibly, seminole, broad, origins, taensas, tunicas, yamasee, yazoos, and, yuchi, scholars, have, studied, the, records, of, hernando, de, soto, s, expedition, of, 1539, 1543, to, learn, of, his, contacts, with, mississippians, as, he, traveled, through, their, villages, of, the, southeast, he, visited, many, villages, in, some, cases, staying, for, a, month, or, longer, the, list, of, sites, and, peoples, visited, by, the, hernando, de, soto, expedition, chronicles, those, villages, some, encounters, were, violent, while, others, were, relatively, peaceful, in, some, cases, de, soto, seems, to, have, been, used, as, a, tool, or, ally, in, long, standing, native, feuds, in, one, example, de, soto, negotiated, a, truce, between, the, pacaha, and, the, casqui, de, soto, s, later, encounters, left, about, half, of, the, spaniards, and, perhaps, many, hundreds, of, native, americans, dead, the, chronicles, of, de, soto, are, among, the, first, documents, written, about, mississippian, peoples, and, are, an, invaluable, source, of, information, on, their, cultural, practices, the, chronicles, of, the, narv, ez, expedition, were, written, before, the, de, soto, expedition, the, narv, ez, expedition, informed, the, court, of, de, soto, about, the, new, world, after, the, destruction, and, flight, of, the, de, soto, expedition, the, mississippian, peoples, continued, their, way, of, life, with, little, direct, european, influence, indirectly, however, european, introductions, dramatically, changed, these, native, societies, because, the, natives, lacked, immunity, to, infectious, diseases, unknowingly, carried, by, the, europeans, such, as, measles, and, smallpox, epidemics, caused, so, many, fatalities, that, they, undermined, the, social, order, of, many, chiefdoms, some, groups, adopted, european, horses, and, changed, to, nomadism, political, structures, collapsed, in, many, places, at, joara, near, morganton, north, carolina, native, americans, of, the, mississippian, culture, interacted, with, spanish, colonizers, of, the, juan, pardo, expedition, who, built, a, base, there, in, 1567, called, fort, san, juan, expedition, documentation, and, archaeological, evidence, of, the, fort, and, native, american, culture, both, exist, the, soldiers, were, at, the, fort, about, 18, months, 1567, 1568, before, the, natives, killed, them, and, destroyed, the, fort, they, killed, soldiers, stationed, at, five, other, forts, as, well, only, one, man, of, 120, survived, sixteenth, century, spanish, artifacts, have, been, recovered, from, the, site, marking, the, first, european, colonization, in, the, interior, of, what, became, the, united, states, by, the, time, more, documentary, accounts, were, being, written, the, mississippian, way, of, life, had, changed, irrevocably, some, groups, maintained, an, oral, tradition, link, to, their, mound, building, past, such, as, the, late, 19th, century, cherokee, other, native, american, groups, having, migrated, many, hundreds, of, miles, and, lost, their, elders, to, diseases, did, not, know, their, ancestors, had, built, the, mounds, dotting, the, landscape, this, contributed, to, the, myth, of, the, mound, builders, as, a, people, distinct, from, native, americans, which, was, rigorously, debunked, by, cyrus, thomas, in, 1894
