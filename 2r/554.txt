and, seven, other, eastern, bloc, socialist, republics, of, central, and, eastern, europe, in, may, 1955, during, the, cold, war, the, term, warsaw, pact, commonly, refers, to, both, the, treaty, itself, and, its, resultant, military, alliance, the, warsaw, treaty, organization, wto, the, warsaw, pact, was, the, military, complement, to, the, council, for, mutual, economic, assistance, comecon, the, economic, organization, for, the, eastern, bloc, states, dominated, by, the, soviet, union, the, warsaw, pact, was, established, as, a, balance, of, power, or, counterweight, to, the, north, atlantic, treaty, organization, nato, and, the, western, bloc, there, was, no, direct, military, confrontation, between, the, two, organizations, instead, the, conflict, was, fought, on, an, ideological, basis, and, through, proxy, wars, both, nato, and, the, warsaw, pact, led, to, the, expansion, of, military, forces, and, their, integration, into, the, respective, blocs, the, warsaw, pact, s, largest, military, engagement, was, the, warsaw, pact, invasion, of, czechoslovakia, its, own, member, state, in, august, 1968, with, the, participation, of, all, pact, nations, except, albania, and, romania, which, in, part, resulted, in, albania, withdrawing, from, the, pact, less, than, one, month, later, the, pact, began, to, unravel, with, the, spread, of, the, revolutions, of, 1989, through, the, eastern, bloc, beginning, with, the, solidarity, movement, in, poland, its, electoral, success, in, june, 1989, and, the, pan, european, picnic, in, august, 1989, east, germany, withdrew, from, the, pact, following, german, reunification, in, 1990, on, 25, february, 1991, at, a, meeting, in, hungary, the, pact, was, declared, at, an, end, by, the, defense, and, foreign, ministers, of, the, six, remaining, member, states, the, ussr, itself, was, dissolved, in, december, 1991, although, most, of, the, former, soviet, republics, formed, the, collective, security, treaty, organization, shortly, thereafter, in, the, following, 20, years, the, warsaw, pact, countries, outside, the, ussr, each, joined, nato, east, germany, through, its, reunification, with, west, germany, and, the, czech, republic, and, slovakia, as, separate, countries, as, did, the, baltic, states, before, the, creation, of, the, warsaw, pact, the, czechoslovak, leadership, fearful, of, a, rearmed, germany, sought, to, create, a, security, pact, with, east, germany, and, poland, these, states, protested, strongly, against, the, re, militarization, of, west, germany, the, warsaw, pact, was, put, in, place, as, a, consequence, of, the, rearming, of, west, germany, inside, nato, soviet, leaders, like, many, european, leaders, on, both, sides, of, the, iron, curtain, feared, germany, being, once, again, a, military, power, and, a, direct, threat, the, consequences, of, german, militarism, remained, a, fresh, memory, among, the, soviets, and, eastern, europeans, as, the, soviet, union, already, had, an, armed, presence, and, political, domination, all, over, its, eastern, satellite, states, by, 1955, the, pact, has, been, long, considered, superfluous, and, because, of, the, rushed, way, in, which, it, was, conceived, nato, officials, labeled, it, a, cardboard, castle, the, ussr, fearing, the, restoration, of, german, militarism, in, west, germany, had, suggested, in, 1954, that, it, join, nato, but, this, was, rejected, by, the, us, the, soviet, request, to, join, nato, arose, in, the, aftermath, of, the, berlin, conference, of, january, february, 1954, soviet, foreign, minister, molotov, made, proposals, to, have, germany, reunified, and, elections, for, a, pan, german, government, under, conditions, of, withdrawal, of, the, four, powers, armies, and, german, neutrality, but, all, were, refused, by, the, other, foreign, ministers, dulles, us, eden, uk, and, bidault, france, proposals, for, the, reunification, of, germany, were, nothing, new, earlier, on, 20, march, 1952, talks, about, a, german, reunification, initiated, by, the, so, called, stalin, note, ended, after, the, united, kingdom, france, and, the, united, states, insisted, that, a, unified, germany, should, not, be, neutral, and, should, be, free, to, join, the, european, defence, community, edc, and, rearm, james, dunn, us, who, met, in, paris, with, eden, konrad, adenauer, west, germany, and, robert, schuman, france, affirmed, that, the, object, should, be, to, avoid, discussion, with, the, russians, and, to, press, on, the, european, defense, community, according, to, john, gaddis, there, was, little, inclination, in, western, capitals, to, explore, this, offer, from, the, ussr, while, historian, rolf, steininger, asserts, that, adenauer, s, conviction, that, neutralization, means, sovietization, referring, to, the, soviet, union, s, policies, towards, finland, known, as, finlandization, was, the, main, factor, in, the, rejection, of, the, soviet, proposals, adenauer, also, feared, that, german, unification, might, have, resulted, in, the, end, of, the, cdu, s, leading, political, role, in, the, west, german, bundestag, consequently, molotov, fearing, that, the, edc, would, be, directed, in, the, future, against, the, ussr, and, seeking, to, prevent, the, formation, of, groups, of, european, states, directed, against, the, other, european, states, made, a, proposal, for, a, general, european, treaty, on, collective, security, in, europe, open, to, all, european, states, without, regard, to, their, social, systems, which, would, have, included, the, unified, germany, thus, rendering, the, edc, obsolete, but, eden, dulles, and, bidault, opposed, the, proposal, one, month, later, the, proposed, european, treaty, was, rejected, not, only, by, supporters, of, the, edc, but, also, by, western, opponents, of, the, european, defence, community, like, french, gaullist, leader, gaston, palewski, who, perceived, it, as, unacceptable, in, its, present, form, because, it, excludes, the, usa, from, participation, in, the, collective, security, system, in, europe, the, soviets, then, decided, to, make, a, new, proposal, to, the, governments, of, the, us, uk, and, france, to, accept, the, participation, of, the, us, in, the, proposed, general, european, agreement, as, another, argument, deployed, against, the, soviet, proposal, was, that, it, was, perceived, by, western, powers, as, directed, against, the, north, atlantic, pact, and, its, liquidation, the, soviets, decided, to, declare, their, readiness, to, examine, jointly, with, other, interested, parties, the, question, of, the, participation, of, the, ussr, in, the, north, atlantic, bloc, specifying, that, the, admittance, of, the, usa, into, the, general, european, agreement, should, not, be, conditional, on, the, three, western, powers, agreeing, to, the, ussr, joining, the, north, atlantic, pact, again, all, soviet, proposals, including, the, request, to, join, nato, were, rejected, by, the, uk, us, and, french, governments, shortly, after, emblematic, was, the, position, of, british, general, hastings, ismay, a, fierce, supporter, of, nato, expansion, he, opposed, the, request, to, join, nato, made, by, the, ussr, in, 1954, saying, that, the, soviet, request, to, join, nato, is, like, an, unrepentant, burglar, requesting, to, join, the, police, force, in, april, 1954, adenauer, made, his, first, visit, to, the, united, states, meeting, nixon, eisenhower, and, dulles, ratification, of, the, edc, was, delayed, but, the, us, representatives, made, it, clear, to, adenauer, that, the, edc, would, have, to, become, a, part, of, nato, memories, of, the, nazi, occupation, were, still, strong, and, the, rearmament, of, germany, was, feared, by, france, too, on, 30, august, 1954, the, french, parliament, rejected, the, edc, thus, ensuring, its, failure, and, blocking, a, major, objective, of, us, policy, towards, europe, to, associate, west, germany, militarily, with, the, west, the, us, department, of, state, started, to, elaborate, alternatives, west, germany, would, be, invited, to, join, nato, or, in, the, case, of, french, obstructionism, strategies, to, circumvent, a, french, veto, would, be, implemented, in, order, to, obtain, german, rearmament, outside, nato, on, 23, october, 1954, the, admission, of, the, federal, republic, of, germany, to, the, north, atlantic, pact, was, finally, decided, the, incorporation, of, west, germany, into, the, organization, on, 9, may, 1955, was, described, as, a, decisive, turning, point, in, the, history, of, our, continent, by, halvard, lange, foreign, affairs, minister, of, norway, at, the, time, in, november, 1954, the, ussr, requested, a, new, european, security, treaty, in, order, to, make, a, final, attempt, to, not, have, a, remilitarized, west, germany, potentially, opposed, to, the, soviet, union, with, no, success, on, 14, may, 1955, the, ussr, and, seven, other, eastern, european, countries, reaffirming, their, desire, for, the, establishment, of, a, system, of, european, collective, security, based, on, the, participation, of, all, european, states, irrespective, of, their, social, and, political, systems, established, the, warsaw, pact, in, response, to, the, integration, of, the, federal, republic, of, germany, into, nato, declaring, that, a, remilitarized, western, germany, and, the, integration, of, the, latter, in, the, north, atlantic, bloc, increase, the, danger, of, another, war, and, constitutes, a, threat, to, the, national, security, of, the, peaceable, states, in, these, circumstances, the, peaceable, european, states, must, take, the, necessary, measures, to, safeguard, their, security, one, of, the, founding, members, east, germany, was, allowed, to, re, arm, by, the, soviet, union, and, the, national, people, s, army, was, established, as, the, armed, forces, of, the, country, to, counter, the, rearmament, of, west, germany, the, ussr, concentrated, on, its, own, recovery, seizing, and, transferring, most, of, germany, s, industrial, plants, and, it, exacted, war, reparations, from, east, germany, hungary, romania, and, bulgaria, using, soviet, dominated, joint, enterprises, it, also, instituted, trading, arrangements, deliberately, designed, to, favour, the, country, moscow, controlled, the, communist, parties, that, ruled, the, satellite, states, and, they, followed, orders, from, the, kremlin, historian, mark, kramer, concludes, the, net, outflow, of, resources, from, eastern, europe, to, the, soviet, union, was, approximately, 15, billion, to, 20, billion, in, the, first, decade, after, world, war, ii, an, amount, roughly, equal, to, the, total, aid, provided, by, the, united, states, to, western, europe, under, the, marshall, plan, in, november, 1956, soviet, forces, invaded, hungary, a, warsaw, pact, member, state, and, violently, put, down, the, hungarian, revolution, after, that, the, ussr, made, bilateral, 20, year, treaties, with, poland, 17, december, 1956, the, gdr, 12, march, 1957, romania, 15, april, 1957, soviet, forces,

and, north, vietnam, had, observer, status, but, china, withdrew, in, 1961, as, a, consequence, of, the, albanian, soviet, split, in, which, china, backed, albania, against, the, ussr, as, part, of, the, larger, sino, soviet, split, of, the, early, 1960s, for, 36, years, nato, and, the, warsaw, pact, never, directly, waged, war, against, each, other, in, europe, the, united, states, and, the,

disbanded, at, a, meeting, of, defence, and, foreign, ministers, from, remaining, pact, countries, meeting, in, hungary, on, 1, july, 1991, in, prague, the, czechoslovak, president, v, clav, havel, formally, ended, the, 1955, warsaw, treaty, organization, of, friendship, cooperation, and, mutual, assistance, and, so, disestablished, the, warsaw, treaty, after, 36, years, of, military, alliance, with, the, ussr, the, ussr, disestablished, itself, in, december, 1991, the, warsaw, treaty, s, organization, was, two, fold, the, political, consultative, committee, handled, political, matters, and, the, combined, command, of, pact, armed, forces, controlled, the, assigned, multi, national, forces, with, headquarters, in, warsaw, poland, although, an, apparently, similar, collective, security, alliance, the, warsaw, pact, differed, substantially, from, nato, de, jure, the, eight, member, countries, of, the, warsaw, pact, pledged, the, mutual, defense, of, any, member, who, would, be, attacked, relations, among, the, treaty, signatories, were, based, upon, mutual, non, intervention, in, the, internal, affairs, of, the, member, countries, respect, for, national, sovereignty, and, political, independence, however, de, facto, the, pact, was, a, direct, reflection, of, the, ussr, s, authoritarianism, and, undisputed, domination, over, the, eastern, bloc, in, the, context, of, the, so, called, soviet, empire, which, was, not, comparable, to, that, of, the, united, states, over, the, western, bloc, all, warsaw, pact, commanders, had, to, be, and, have, been, senior, officers, of, the, soviet, union, at, the, same, time, and, appointed, for, an, unspecified, term, length, the, supreme, commander, of, the, unified, armed, forces, of, the, warsaw, treaty, organization, which, commanded, and, controlled, all, the, military, forces, of, the, member, countries, was, also, a, first, deputy, minister, of, defence, of, the, ussr, and, the, chief, of, combined, staff, of, the, unified, armed, forces, of, the, warsaw, treaty, organization, was, also, a, first, deputy, chief, of, the, general, staff, of, the, soviet, armed, forces, on, the, contrary, the, secretary, general, of, nato, and, chair, of, the, nato, military, committee, are, positions, with, fixed, term, of, office, held, on, a, random, rotating, basis, by, officials, from, all, member, countries, through, consensus, despite, the, american, hegemony, mainly, military, and, economic, over, nato, all, decisions, of, the, north, atlantic, alliance, required, unanimous, consensus, in, the, north, atlantic, council, and, the, entry, of, countries, into, the, alliance, was, not, subject, to, domination, but, rather, a, natural, democratic, process, in, the, warsaw, pact, decisions, were, ultimately, taken, by, the, soviet, union, alone, the, countries, of, the, warsaw, pact, were, not, equally, able, to, negotiate, their, entry, in, the, pact, nor, the, decisions, taken, although, nominally, a, defensive, alliance, the, pact, s, primary, function, was, to, safeguard, the, soviet, union, s, hegemony, over, its, eastern, european, satellites, with, the, pact, s, only, direct, military, actions, having, been, the, invasions, of, its, own, member, states, to, keep, them, from, breaking, away, romania, and, until, 1968, albania, were, exceptions, together, with, yugoslavia, which, broke, with, the, soviet, union, before, the, warsaw, pact, was, created, these, three, countries, completely, rejected, the, soviet, doctrine, formulated, for, the, pact, albania, officially, left, the, organization, in, 1968, in, protest, of, its, invasion, of, czechoslovakia, romania, had, its, own, reasons, for, remaining, a, formal, member, of, the, warsaw, pact, such, as, nicolae, ceau, escu, s, interest, of, preserving, the, threat, of, a, pact, invasion, so, he, could, sell, himself, as, a, nationalist, as, well, as, privileged, access, to, nato, counterparts, and, a, seat, at, various, european, forums, which, otherwise, he, would, not, have, had, for, instance, romania, and, the, soviet, led, remainder, of, the, warsaw, pact, formed, two, distinct, groups, in, the, elaboration, of, the, helsinki, final, act, when, andrei, grechko, assumed, command, of, the, warsaw, pact, both, romania, and, albania, had, for, all, practical, purposes, defected, from, the, pact, in, the, early, 1960s, grechko, initiated, programs, meant, to, preempt, romanian, doctrinal, heresies, from, spreading, to, other, pact, members, romania, s, doctrine, of, territorial, defense, threatened, the, pact, s, unity, and, cohesion, no, other, country, succeeded, in, escaping, from, the, warsaw, pact, like, romania, and, albania, did, for, example, the, mainstays, of, romania, s, tank, forces, were, locally, developed, models, soviet, troops, were, deployed, to, romania, for, the, last, time, in, 1963, as, part, of, a, warsaw, pact, exercise, after, 1964, the, soviet, army, was, barred, from, returning, to, romania, as, the, country, refused, to, take, part, in, joint, pact, exercises, even, before, the, advent, of, nicolae, ceau, escu, romania, was, in, fact, an, independent, country, as, opposed, to, the, rest, of, the, warsaw, pact, to, some, extent, it, was, even, more, independent, than, cuba, a, communist, soviet, aligned, state, that, was, not, a, member, of, the, warsaw, pact, the, romanian, regime, was, largely, impervious, to, soviet, political, influence, and, ceau, escu, was, the, only, declared, opponent, of, glasnost, and, perestroika, on, account, of, the, contentious, relationship, between, bucharest, and, moscow, the, west, did, not, hold, the, soviet, union, responsible, for, the, policies, pursued, by, bucharest, this, was, not, the, case, for, the, other, countries, in, the, region, such, as, czechoslovakia, and, poland, at, the, start, of, 1990, the, soviet, foreign, minister, eduard, shevardnadze, implicitly, confirmed, the, lack, of, soviet, influence, over, ceau, escu, s, romania, when, asked, whether, it, made, sense, for, him, to, visit, romania, less, than, two, weeks, after, its, revolution, shevardnadze, insisted, that, only, by, going, in, person, to, romania, could, he, figure, out, how, to, restore, soviet, influence, romania, requested, and, obtained, the, complete, withdrawal, of, the, soviet, army, from, its, territory, in, 1958, the, romanian, campaign, for, independence, culminated, on, 22, april, 1964, when, the, romanian, communist, party, issued, a, declaration, proclaiming, that, every, marxist, leninist, party, has, a, sovereign, right, to, elaborate, choose, or, change, the, forms, and, methods, of, socialist, construction, and, there, exists, no, parent, party, and, offspring, party, no, superior, and, subordinated, parties, but, only, the, large, family, of, communist, and, workers, parties, having, equal, rights, and, also, there, are, not, and, there, can, be, no, unique, patterns, and, recipes, this, amounted, to, a, declaration, of, political, and, ideological, independence, from, moscow, following, albania, s, withdrawal, from, the, warsaw, pact, romania, remained, the, only, pact, member, with, an, independent, military, doctrine, which, denied, the, soviet, union, use, of, its, armed, forces, and, avoided, absolute, dependence, on, soviet, sources, of, military, equipment, romania, was, the, only, non, soviet, warsaw, pact, member, which, was, not, obliged, to, militarily, defend, the, soviet, union, in, case, of, an, armed, attack, bulgaria, and, romania, were, the, only, warsaw, pact, members, that, did, not, have, soviet, troops, stationed, on, their, soil, in, december, 1964, romania, became, the, only, warsaw, pact, member, save, albania, which, would, leave, the, pact, altogether, within, 4, years, from, which, all, soviet, advisors, were, withdrawn, including, those, in, the, intelligence, and, security, services, not, only, did, romania, not, participate, in, joint, operations, with, the, kgb, but, it, also, set, up, departments, specialized, in, anti, kgb, counterespionage, romania, was, neutral, in, the, sino, soviet, split, its, neutrality, in, the, sino, soviet, dispute, along, with, being, the, small, communist, country, with, the, most, influence, in, global, affairs, enabled, romania, to, be, recognized, by, the, world, as, the, third, force, of, the, communist, world, romania, s, independence, achieved, in, the, early, 1960s, through, its, freeing, from, its, soviet, satellite, status, was, tolerated, by, moscow, because, romania, was, not, bordering, the, iron, curtain, being, surrounded, by, socialist, states, and, because, its, ruling, party, was, not, going, to, abandon, communism, although, certain, historians, such, as, robert, king, and, dennis, deletant, argue, against, the, usage, of, the, term, independent, to, describe, romania, s, relations, with, the, soviet, union, favoring, autonomy, instead, on, account, of, the, country, s, continued, membership, within, both, the, comecon, and, the, warsaw, pact, along, with, its, commitment, to, socialism, this, approach, fails, to, explain, why, in, july, 1963, romania, blocked, mongolia, s, accession, to, the, warsaw, pact, why, in, november, 1963, romania, voted, in, favor, of, a, un, resolution, to, establish, a, nuclear, free, zone, in, latin, america, when, the, other, soviet, aligned, countries, abstained, or, why, in, 1964, romania, opposed, the, soviet, proposed, strong, collective, riposte, against, china, and, these, are, examples, solely, from, the, 1963, 1964, period, soviet, disinformation, tried, to, convince, the, west, that, ceau, escu, s, empowerment, was, a, dissimulation, in, connivance, with, moscow, to, an, extent, this, worked, as, some, historians, came, to, see, the, hand, of, moscow, behind, every, romanian, initiative, for, instance, when, romania, became, the, only, eastern, european, country, to, maintain, diplomatic, relations, with, israel, some, historians, have, speculated, that, this, was, at, moscow, s, whim, however, this, theory, fails, upon, closer, inspection, even, during, the, cold, war, some, thought, that, romanian, actions, were, done, at, the, behest, of, the, soviets, but, soviet, anger, at, said, actions,
