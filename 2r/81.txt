west, asia, 6000, 3500, bc, europe, 5500, 2200, bc, central, asia, 3700, 1700, bc, south, asia, 4300, 1800, bc, china, 5000, 2900, bc, the, chalcolithic, also, called, the, copper, age, and, eneolithic, was, an, archaeological, period, characterized, by, the, increasing, use, of, smelted, copper, it, followed, the, neolithic, and, preceded, the, bronze, age, it, occurred, at, different, periods, in, different, areas, but, was, absent, in, some, parts, of, the, world, such, as, russia, where, there, was, no, well, defined, copper, age, between, the, stone, and, bronze, ages, stone, tools, were, still, predominantly, used, during, this, period, the, archaeological, site, of, belovode, on, rudnik, mountain, in, serbia, has, the, world, s, oldest, securely, dated, evidence, of, copper, smelting, at, high, temperature, from, c, 5, 000, bc, the, transition, from, copper, age, to, bronze, age, in, europe, occurred, between, the, late, 5th, and, the, late, 3rd, millennium, bc, in, the, ancient, near, east, the, copper, age, covered, about, the, same, period, beginning, in, the, late, 5th, millennium, bc, and, lasting, for, about, a, millennium, before, it, gave, rise, to, the, early, bronze, age, a, study, in, the, journal, antiquity, from, 2013, reporting, the, discovery, of, a, tin, bronze, foil, from, the, plo, nik, archaeological, site, dated, to, c, 4, 650, bc, as, well, as, 14, other, artefacts, from, bulgaria, and, serbia, dated, to, before, 4, 000, bc, showed, that, early, tin, bronze, was, more, common, than, previously, thought, and, developed, independently, in, europe, 1, 500, years, before, the, first, tin, bronze, alloys, in, the, near, east, in, britain, the, chalcolithic, is, a, short, period, between, about, 2, 500, and, 2, 200, bc, characterized, by, the, first, appearance, of, objects, of, copper, and, gold, a, new, ceramic, culture, and, the, immigration, of, beaker, culture, people, heralding, the, end, of, the, local, late, neolithic, the, multiple, names, result, from, multiple, definitions, of, the, period, originally, the, term, bronze, age, meant, that, either, copper, or, bronze, was, being, used, as, the, chief, hard, substance, for, the, manufacture, of, tools, and, weapons, ancient, writers, who, provided, the, essential, cultural, references, for, educated, people, during, the, 19th, century, used, the, same, name, for, both, copper, and, bronze, using, ages, the, concept, of, the, copper, age, was, put, forward, by, hungarian, scientist, ferenc, pulszky, in, the, 1870s, when, on, the, basis, of, the, significant, number, of, large, copper, objects, unearthed, within, the, carpathian, basin, he, suggested, that, the, previous, threefold, division, of, the, prehistoric, age, the, stone, bronze, and, iron, ages, should, be, further, divided, with, the, introduction, of, the, copper, age, in, 1881, john, evans, recognized, that, use, of, copper, often, preceded, the, use, of, bronze, and, distinguished, between, a, transitional, copper, age, and, the, bronze, age, proper, he, did, not, include, the, transitional, period, in, the, bronze, age, but, described, it, separately, from, the, customary, stone, bronze, iron, system, at, the, bronze, age, s, beginning, he, did, not, however, present, it, as, a, fourth, age, but, chose, to, retain, the, tripartite, system, in, 1884, gaetano, chierici, perhaps, following, the, lead, of, evans, renamed, it, in, italian, as, the, eneo, litica, or, bronze, stone, transition, the, phrase, was, never, intended, to, mean, that, the, period, was, the, only, one, in, which, both, bronze, and, stone, were, used, the, copper, age, features, the, use, of, copper, excluding, bronze, moreover, stone, continued, to, be, used, throughout, both, the, bronze, age, and, the, iron, age, the, part, litica, simply, names, the, stone, age, as, the, point, from, which, the, transition, began, and, is, not, another, lithic, age, subsequently, british, scholars, used, either, evans, s, copper, age, or, the, term, eneolithic, or, neolithic, a, translation, of, chierici, s, eneo, litica, after, several, years, a, number, of, complaints, appeared, in, the, literature, that, eneolithic, seemed, to, the, untrained, eye, to, be, produced, from, e, neolithic, outside, the, neolithic, clearly, not, a, definitive, characterization, of, the, copper, age, around, 1900, many, writers, began, to, substitute, chalcolithic, for, eneolithic, to, avoid, the, false, segmentation, the, term, chalcolithic, is, a, combination, of, two, words, chalco, lithic, derived, from, the, greek, words, khalkos, meaning, copper, and, l, thos, meaning, stone, but, chalcolithic, could, also, mislead, for, readers, unfamiliar, with, the, italian, language, chalcolithic, seemed, to, suggest, another, lithic, age, paradoxically, part, of, the, stone, age, despite, the, use, of, copper, today, copper, age, eneolithic, and, chalcolithic, are, used, synonymously, to, mean, evans, s, original, definition, of, copper, age, the, emergence, of, metallurgy, may, have, occurred, first, in, the, fertile, crescent, lead, may, have, been, the, first, ore, that, humans, smelted, since, it, can, be, easily, obtained, by, heating, galena, possible, early, examples, of, lead, smelting, supported, by, the, extreme, rarity, of, native, lead, include, lead, beads, found, on, level, ix, of, chatal, atal, h, y, k, in, central, anatolia, though, they, might, be, made, of, galena, cerussite, or, metallic, lead, and, accordingly, might, or, might, not, be, evidence, of, early, smelting, a, lead, bead, found, in, a, gk59, group, test, square, in, the, 4th, level, of, jarmo, dated, to, the, 7th, millennium, bce, though, it, is, small, enough, that, its, human, usage, is, doubtful, a, lead, bracelet, found, in, level, xii, of, yarim, tepe, i, dated, to, the, 6th, millennium, bc, a, small, cone, shaped, piece, of, lead, found, in, the, burnt, house, in, tt6, at, arpachiyah, dated, to, the, halaf, period, or, slightly, later, than, the, yarim, tepe, bracelet, and, more, copper, smelting, is, also, documented, at, this, site, at, about, the, same, time, period, soon, after, 6000, bc, however, the, use, of, lead, seems, to, precede, copper, smelting, early, metallurgy, is, also, documented, at, the, nearby, site, of, tell, maghzaliyah, which, seems, to, be, dated, even, earlier, and, completely, lacks, pottery, the, timna, valley, contains, evidence, of, copper, mining, in, 7000, 5000, bc, the, process, of, transition, from, neolithic, to, chalcolithic, in, the, middle, east, is, characterized, in, archaeological, stone, tool, assemblages, by, a, decline, in, high, quality, raw, material, procurement, and, use, this, dramatic, shift, is, seen, throughout, the, region, including, the, tehran, plain, iran, here, analysis, of, six, archaeological, sites, determined, a, marked, downward, trend, in, not, only, material, quality, but, also, in, aesthetic, variation, in, the, lithic, artefacts, fazeli, coningham, use, these, results, as, evidence, of, the, loss, of, craft, specialisation, caused, by, increased, use, of, copper, tools, the, tehran, plain, findings, illustrate, the, effects, of, the, introduction, of, copper, working, technologies, on, the, in, place, systems, of, lithic, craft, specialists, and, raw, materials, networks, of, exchange, and, specialized, processing, and, production, that, had, evolved, during, the, neolithic, seem, to, have, collapsed, by, the, middle, chalcolithic, c, 4500, 3500, bc, and, been, replaced, by, the, use, of, local, materials, by, a, primarily, household, based, production, of, stone, tools, arsenical, copper, or, bronze, was, produced, in, eastern, turkey, malatya, province, at, two, ancient, sites, nor, untepe, and, de, irmentepe, around, 4200, bc, according, to, boscher, 2016, hearths, or, natural, draft, furnaces, slag, ore, and, pigment, had, been, recovered, throughout, these, sites, this, was, in, the, context, of, ubaid, period, architectural, complexes, typical, of, southern, mesopotamian, architecture, nor, untepe, site, demonstrates, that, some, form, of, arsenic, alloying, was, indeed, taking, place, by, the, 4th, millennium, bc, since, the, slag, identified, at, nor, untepe, contains, no, arsenic, this, means, that, arsenic, in, some, form, was, added, separately, a, copper, axe, found, at, prokuplje, serbia, contains, the, oldest, securely, dated, evidence, of, copper, making, c, 5500, bc, 7, 500, years, ago, the, find, in, june, 2010, extends, the, known, record, of, copper, smelting, by, about, 800, years, and, suggests, that, copper, smelting, may, have, been, invented, in, separate, parts, of, asia, and, europe, at, that, time, rather, than, spreading, from, a, single, source, knowledge, of, the, use, of, copper, was, far, more, widespread, than, the, metal, itself, the, european, battle, axe, culture, used, stone, axes, modeled, on, copper, axes, even, with, moulding, carved, in, the, stone, tzi, the, iceman, who, was, found, in, the, tztal, alps, in, 1991, and, whose, remains, have, been, dated, to, about, 3300, bc, was, found, with, a, mondsee, copper, axe, examples, of, chalcolithic, cultures, in, europe, include, vila, nova, de, s, o, pedro, and, los, millares, on, the, iberian, peninsula, pottery, of, the, beaker, people, has, been, found, at, both, sites, dating, to, several, centuries, after, copper, working, began, there, the, beaker, culture, appears, to, have, spread, copper, and, bronze, technologies, in, europe, along, with, indo, european, languages, in, britain, copper, was, used, between, the, 25th, and, 22nd, centuries, bc, but, some, archaeologists, do, not, recognise, a, british, chalcolithic, because, production, and, use, was, on, a, small, scale, ceramic, similarities, between, the, indus, valley, civilisation, southern, turkmenistan, and, northern, iran, during, 4300, 3300, bc, of, the, chalcolithic, period, suggest, considerable, mobility, and, trade, the, term, chalcolithic, has, also, been, used, in, the, context, of, the, south, asian, stone, age, in, bhirrana, the, earliest, indus, civilization, site, copper, bangles, and, arrowheads, were, found, the, inhabitants, of, mehrgarh, in, present, day, pakistan, fashioned, tools, with, local, copper, ore, between, 7000, and, 3300, bc, the, nausharo, site, was, a, pottery, workshop, in, province, of, balochistan, pakistan, that, dates, to, 4, 500, years, ago, 12, blades, and, blade, fragments, were, excavated, there, these, blades, are, 12, 18, cm, 5, 7, in, long, 1, 2, 2, 0, cm, 0, 5, 0, 8, in, wide, and, relatively, thin, archaeological, experiments, show, that, these, blades, were, made, with, a, copper, indenter, and, functioned, as, a, potter, s, tool, to, trim, and, shape, unfired, pottery, petrographic, analysis, indicates, local, pottery, manufacturing, but, also, reveals, the, existence, of, a, few, exotic, black, slipped, pottery, items, from, the, indus, valley, in, india, chalcolithic, culture, flourished, in, mainly, four, farming, communities, ahar, or, banas, kayatha, malwa, and, jorwe, these, communities, had, some, common, traits, like, painted, pottery, and, use, of, copper, but, they, had, a, distinct, ceramic, design, tradition, banas, culture, 2000, 1600, bc, had, ceramics, with, red, white, and, black, design, kayatha, culture, 2450, 1700, bc, had, ceramics, painted, with, brown, colored, design, malwa, culture, 1900, 1400, bc, had, profusely, decorated, pottery, with, red, or, black, colored, design, jorwe, culture, 1500, 900, bc, had, ceramics, with, matte, surface, and, black, on, red, design, pandu, rajar, dhibi, 2000, 1600, bc, is, a, chalcolithic, site, in, the, eastern, part, of, the, indian, subcontinent, it, is, located, on, the, south, bank, of, ajay, river, in, west, bengal, blackware, painted, koshi, ware, pottery, various, ornaments, made, of, pearl, and, copper, various, types, of, tools, pieces, of, fabric, woven, from, shimul, cotton, thread, human, and, various, animal, skeletons, burnt, clay, fragments, have, been, found, at, the, site, in, march, 2018, archaeologists, had, discovered, three, carts, and, copper, artifacts, including, weapons, dating, to, 1800, bc, in, sanauli, village, of, uttar, pradesh, the, artifacts, belongs, to, ochre, coloured, pottery, culture, andean, civilizations, in, south, america, appear, to, have, independently, invented, copper, smelting, the, term, chalcolithic, is, also, applied, to, american, civilizations, that, already, used, copper, and, copper, alloys, thousands, of, years, before, europeans, immigrated, besides, cultures, in, the, andes, and, mesoamerica, the, old, copper, complex, mined, and, fabricated, copper, as, tools, weapons, and, personal, ornaments, in, an, area, centered, in, the, upper, great, lakes, region, present, day, michigan, and, wisconsin, the, evidence, of, smelting, or, alloying, that, has, been, found, in, north, america, is, subject, to, some, dispute, and, a, common, assumption, by, archaeologists, is, that, objects, were, cold, worked, into, shape, artifacts, from, some, of, these, sites, have, been, dated, to, 6500, 1000, bc, making, them, some, of, the, oldest, chalcolithic, sites, in, the, world, some, archaeologists, find, artifactual, and, structural, evidence, of, casting, by, hopewellian, and, mississippian, peoples, to, be, demonstrated, in, the, archaeological, record, in, the, 5th, millennium, bc, copper, artifacts, start, to, appear, in, east, asia, such, as, in, the, jiangzhai, and, hongshan, cultures, but, those, metal, artifacts, were, not, widely, used, during, this, early, stage, copper, manufacturing, gradually, appeared, in, the, yangshao, period, 5000, 3000, bc, jiangzhai, is, the, only, site, where, copper, artifacts, were, found, in, the, banpo, culture, archaeologists, have, found, remains, of, copper, metallurgy, in, various, cultures, from, the, late, fourth, to, the, early, third, millennia, bc, these, include, the, copper, smelting, remains, and, copper, artifacts, of, the, hongshan, culture, 4700, 2900, and, copper, slag, at, the, yuanwozhen, site, this, indicates, that, inhabitants, of, the, yellow, river, valley, had, already, learned, how, to, make, copper, artifacts, by, the, later, yangshao, period, in, the, region, of, the, a, r, mountains, niger, independent, copper, smelting, developed, between, 3000, and, 2500, bc, the, process, was, not, in, a, developed, state, indicating, smelting, was, not, foreign, it, became, mature, about, 1500, bc
