the, condition, how, is, the, government, doing, have, fun, after, reading, this, letter, the, peshwa, felt, a, bit, humiliated, and, in, a, fit, of, rage, ordered, the, maratha, army, to, attack, but, the, army, could, not, do, anything, because, the, kolis, themselves, were, subedars, and, had, fortified, the, forts, well, and, the, peshwa, faced, failure, the, humiliated, peshwa, started, taking, the, kolis, of, chivhe, clan, as, captives, all, those, chivhe, kolis, who, were, living, in, the, territory, of, the, peshwa, were, declared, rebels, and, started, being, captured, after,

of, obtaining, redress, in, response, the, peshwa, sent, maratha, troops, from, pune, against, rebel, kolis, and, surprised, them, killed, and, wounded, many, of, them, the, koli, leaders, were, consequently, forced, to, disperse, the, rebels, the, government, officers, learned, that, sattu, shelkande, chief, of, the, insurgents, was, hiding, in, the, neighboring, jungle, they, obliged, him, to, enter, into, the, sunkli, zamin, or, chain, security, one, patil, providing, security, for, two, or, three, cultivators, another, patil, for, five, or, six, poorer, patils, and, a, deshmukh, for, a, number, of, the, patils, hearing, of, the, measures, the, government, officers, were, adopting, they, moved, off, to, another, place, this, was, partly, for, their, own, safety, and, partly, to,

their, operations, several, seasons, passed, this, way, but, when, javji, bamble, was, appointed, as, mansabdar, of, rajur, he, was, ordered, by, the, peshwa, to, prevent, the, rebellious, activities, by, rebels, kolis, did, not, wish, to, fight, with, bamble, because, he, was, also, a, koli, by, caste, the, kolis, remained, quiet, for, four, years, but, kolis, went, again, to, the, jungles,

declared, that, he, would, not, pardon, the, kolis, again, as, they, were, such, a, turbulent, race, and, as, no, faith, could, be, reposed, in, them, nana, fadnavis, detached, a, few, brahmins, disguised, as, gusai, who, gained, information, of, the, hiding, place, of, kolis, and, a, detachment, that, marched, to, apprehend, them, was, so, fortunate, as, to, bring, them, all, prisoners, to, junnar, where, the, five, kolis, were, executed, balwantrao, brother, in, law, to, nana, fadnavis, was, subedar, of, the, district, at, the, time, and, it, is, claimed, that, balwantrao, became, very,

offence, went, unpunished, and, this, he, did, with, so, much, care, and, attention, that, he, specially, charged, his, governors, to, inform, him, in, writing, of, the, conduct, of, his, soldiers, mentioning, in, particular, those, who, had, distinguished, themselves, and, he, would, at, once, order, their, promotion, either, in, rank, or, in, pay, according, to, their, merit, he, was, naturally, loved, by, all, men, of, valor, and, good, conduct, the, marathas, carried, out, many, sea, raids, such, as, plundering, mughal, naval, ships, and, european, trading, vessels, european, traders, described, these, attacks, as, piracy, but, the, marathas, viewed, them, as, legitimate, targets, because, they, were, trading, with, and, thus, financially, supporting, their, mughal, and, bijapur, enemies, after, the, representatives, of, various, european, powers, signed, agreements, with, shivaji, or, his, successors, the, threat, of, plundering, or, raids, against, europeans, began, to, reduce, the, maratha, army, under, shivaji, was, a, national, army, consisting, of, personnel, drawn, mainly, from, his, empire, which, corresponds, to, present, day, maharashtra, it, was, a, homogeneous, body, commanded, by, a, regular, cadre, of, officers, who, had, to, obey, one, supreme, commander, with, the, rise, of, the, peshwas, however, this, national, army, had, to, make, room, for, a, feudal, force, provided, by, different, maratha, sardars, this, new, maratha, army, was, not, homogeneous, but, employed, soldiers, of, different, backgrounds, both, locals, and, foreign, mercenaries, including, large, numbers, of, arabs, sikhs, rajputs, sindhis, rohillas, abyssinians, pashtuns, and, europeans, the, army, of, nana, fadnavis, for, example, included, 5, 000, arabs, some, historians, have, credited, the, maratha, navy, for, laying, the, foundation, of, the, indian, navy, and, bringing, significant, changes, in, naval, warfare, a, series, of, sea, forts, and, battleships, were, built, in, the, 17th, century, during, the, reign, of, shivaji, it, has, been, noted, that, vessels, built, in, the, dockyards, of, konkan, were, mostly, indigenous, and, constructed, without, foreign, aid, further, in, the, 18th, century, during, the, reign, of, admiral, kanhoji, angre, a, host, of, dockyard, facilities, were, built, along, the, entire, western, coastline, of, present, day, maharashtra, the, marathas, fortified, the, entire, coastline, with, sea, fortresses, with, navigational, facilities, nearly, all, the, hill, forts, which, dot, the, landscape, of, present, day, western, maharashtra, were, built, by, the, marathas, the, renovation, of, gingee, fort, in, tamil, nadu, has, been, particularly, applauded, according, to, the, contemporary, european, accounts, the, defence, fortifications, matched, the, european, ones, the, marathas, prioritized, technical, advancement, over, establishing, a, modern, command, structure, resulting, in, a, trade, off, while, they, excelled, as, craftsmen, and, technicians, successfully, replicating, the, latest, foreign, military, technology, their, ability, to, govern, as, nation, builders, was, hindered, because, they, struggled, to, effectively, manage, the, intricate, workings, of, command, and, failed, to, address, the, shortcomings, in, their, general, staff, system, the, fragmented, maratha, state, was, unable, to, unite, due, to, political, divisions, undoing, the, progress, made, through, technology, the, maratha, army, especially, its, infantry, was, praised, by, almost, all, the, enemies, of, the, maratha, empire, ranging, from, the, duke, of, wellington, to, ahmad, shah, abdali, after, the, third, battle, of, panipat, abdali, was, relieved, as, the, maratha, army, in, the, initial, stages, were, almost, in, the, position, of, destroying, the, afghan, armies, and, their, indian, allies, the, nawab, of, oudh, and, rohillas, the, grand, wazir, of, the, durrani, empire, sardar, shah, wali, khan, was, shocked, when, maratha, commander, in, chief, sadashivrao, bhau, launched, a, fierce, assault, on, the, centre, of, the, durrani, army, over, 10, 000, durrani, soldiers, were, killed, alongside, haji, atai, khan, one, of, the, chief, commander, of, the, durrani, army, and, nephew, of, wazir, shah, wali, khan, such, was, the, fierce, assault, of, the, maratha, infantry, in, hand, to, hand, combat, that, afghan, armies, started, to, flee, and, the, wazir, in, desperation, and, rage, shouted, comrades, whither, do, you, fly, our, country, is, far, off, post, battle, ahmad, shah, abdali, in, a, letter, to, one, indian, ruler, claimed, that, afghans, were, able, to, defeat, the, marathas, only, because, of, the, blessings, of, the, almighty, and, that, any, other, army, would, have, been, destroyed, by, the, maratha, army, on, that, particular, day, even, though, the, maratha, army, was, numerically, inferior, to, the, durrani, army, and, its, indian, allies, though, abdali, won, the, battle, he, also, had, heavy, casualties, on, his, side, hence, he, sought, immediate, peace, with, the, marathas, abdali, wrote, in, his, letter, to, peshwa, on, 10, february, 1761, there, is, no, reason, to, have, animosity, amongst, us, your, son, vishwasrao, and, your, brother, sadashivrao, died, in, battle, it, was, unfortunate, bhau, started, the, battle, so, i, had, to, fight, back, unwillingly, yet, i, feel, sorry, for, his, death, please, continue, your, guardianship, of, delhi, as, before, to, that, i, have, no, opposition, only, let, punjab, until, sutlaj, remain, with, us, reinstate, shah, alam, on, delhi, s, throne, as, you, did, before, and, let, there, be, peace, and, friendship, between, us, this, is, my, ardent, desire, please, grant, me, that, desire, similarly, arthur, wellesley, 1st, duke, of, wellington, after, defeating, the, marathas, noted, that, the, marathas, though, poorly, led, by, their, generals, had, regular, infantry, and, artillery, that, matched, the, level, of, that, of, the, europeans, and, warned, other, british, officers, from, underestimating, the, marathas, on, the, battlefield, he, cautioned, one, british, general, you, must, never, allow, maratha, infantry, to, attack, head, on, or, in, close, hand, to, hand, combat, as, in, that, your, army, will, cover, itself, with, utter, disgrace, he, summarised, maratha, tactics, as, follows, the, mahrattas, employ, two, methods, in, their, operations, they, primarily, rely, on, their, cavalry, to, disrupt, the, enemy, s, supplies, causing, distress, in, their, camp, and, forcing, them, to, retreat, once, the, retreat, begins, the, mahrattas, unleash, their, infantry, and, formidable, artillery, to, relentlessly, pursue, the, enemy, by, depriving, the, opponent, of, provisions, they, compel, them, to, hasten, their, march, while, remaining, confident, in, their, own, safety, from, counterattacks, they, trail, the, enemy, with, their, cavalry, during, marches, and, when, the, enemy, halts, they, encircle, and, assault, them, using, their, infantry, and, cannons, making, escape, nearly, impossible, under, no, circumstances, should, you, allow, the, enemy, to, engage, you, with, their, infantry, the, mahrattas, possess, such, powerful, artillery, that, it, would, be, impossible, to, maintain, your, camp, against, it, if, you, receive, word, of, their, approach, when, they, are, close, and, ready, to, attack, it, would, be, advisable, to, secure, your, baggage, in, any, way, possible, and, initiate, an, attack, against, them, it, is, crucial, to, prevent, them, from, launching, an, attack, on, your, camp, at, all, costs, even, when, wellesley, became, the, prime, minister, of, britain, he, held, the, maratha, infantry, in, utmost, respect, claiming, it, to, be, one, of, the, best, in, the, world, however, at, the, same, time, he, noted, the, poor, leadership, of, maratha, generals, who, were, often, responsible, for, their, defeats, wellesley, charles, metcalfe, one, of, the, ablest, of, the, british, officials, in, india, and, later, acting, governor, general, wrote, in, 1806, india, contains, no, more, than, two, great, powers, british, and, mahratta, and, every, other, state, acknowledges, the, influence, of, one, or, the, other, every, inch, that, we, recede, will, be, occupied, by, them, norman, gash, says, that, the, maratha, infantry, was, equal, to, that, of, british, infantry, after, the, third, anglo, maratha, war, in, 1818, britain, listed, the, marathas, as, one, of, the, martial, races, to, serve, in, the, british, indian, army, the, 19th, century, diplomat, sir, justin, sheil, commented, about, the, british, east, india, company, copying, the, french, indian, army, in, raising, an, army, of, indians, it, is, to, the, military, genius, of, the, french, that, we, are, indebted, for, the, formation, of, the, indian, army, our, warlike, neighbours, were, the, first, to, introduce, into, india, the, system, of, drilling, native, troops, and, converting, them, into, a, regularly, disciplined, force, their, example, was, copied, by, us, and, the, result, is, what, we, now, behold, the, french, carried, to, persia, the, same, military, and, administrative, faculties, and, established, the, origin, of, the, present, persian, regular, army, as, it, is, styled, when, napoleon, the, great, resolved, to, take, iran, under, his, auspices, he, dispatched, several, officers, of, superior, intelligence, to, that, country, with, the, mission, of, general, gardanne, in, 1808, those, gentlemen, commenced, their, operations, in, the, provinces, of, azerbaijan, and, kermanshah, and, it, is, said, with, considerable, success, satara, kolhapur, from, balaji, vishwanath, onwards, the, actual, power, gradually, shifted, to, the, bhat, family, of, peshwas, based, in, poona
