the, 1970, bhola, cyclone, also, known, as, the, great, cyclone, of, 1970, was, a, devastating, tropical, cyclone, that, struck, east, pakistan, present, day, bangladesh, and, india, s, west, bengal, on, november, 12, 1970, it, remains, the, deadliest, tropical, cyclone, ever, recorded, and, one, of, the, world, s, deadliest, humanitarian, disasters, at, least, 300, 000, people, died, in, the, storm, possibly, as, many, as, 500, 000, primarily, as, a, result, of, the, storm, surge, that, flooded, much, of, the, low, lying, islands, of, the, ganges, delta, bhola, was, the, sixth, and, strongest, cyclonic, storm, of, the, 1970, north, indian, ocean, cyclone, season, the, cyclone, formed, over, the, central, bay, of, bengal, on, november, 8, and, traveled, northward, intensifying, as, it, did, so, it, reached, its, peak, with, winds, of, 185, km, h, 115, mph, on, november, 10, and, made, landfall, on, the, coast, of, east, pakistan, on, the, following, afternoon, the, storm, surge, devastated, many, of, the, offshore, islands, wiping, out, villages, and, destroying, crops, throughout, the, region, in, the, most, severely, affected, upazila, tazumuddin, over, 45, of, the, population, of, 167, 000, were, killed, by, the, storm, the, pakistani, government, led, by, junta, leader, general, yahya, khan, was, criticized, for, its, delayed, handling, of, relief, operations, following, the, storm, both, by, local, political, leaders, in, east, pakistan, and, by, the, international, media, the, poor, and, discriminating, response, from, the, west, pakistan, government, led, to, the, increasingly, widespread, disillusionment, from, the, east, pakistani, people, allowing, the, opposition, awami, league, to, gain, a, landslide, victory, in, the, province, during, the, election, that, took, place, a, month, later, as, well, as, the, bangladesh, liberation, war, 7, months, later, on, november, 1, tropical, storm, nora, developed, over, the, south, china, sea, in, the, west, pacific, ocean, the, system, lasted, for, four, days, before, degenerating, into, a, remnant, low, over, the, gulf, of, thailand, on, november, 4, and, subsequently, moved, west, over, the, malay, peninsula, on, november, 5, 1970, the, remnants, of, this, system, contributed, to, the, development, of, a, new, depression, in, the, central, bay, of, bengal, on, the, morning, of, november, 8, the, depression, intensified, as, it, moved, slowly, northward, and, the, india, meteorological, department, upgraded, it, to, a, cyclonic, storm, the, next, day, no, country, in, the, region, had, ever, named, tropical, cyclones, during, this, time, so, no, new, identity, was, given, the, storm, became, nearly, stationary, that, evening, near, 14, 5, n, 87, e, but, began, to, accelerate, toward, the, north, on, november, 10, the, storm, further, intensified, into, a, severe, cyclonic, storm, on, november, 11, and, began, to, turn, towards, the, northeast, as, it, approached, the, head, of, the, bay, it, developed, a, clear, eye, and, reached, its, peak, intensity, later, that, day, with, three, minute, sustained, winds, of, 185, km, h, 115, mph, one, minute, sustained, winds, of, 240, km, h, 150, mph, and, a, central, pressure, of, 960, hpa, the, cyclone, made, landfall, on, the, east, pakistan, coastline, during, the, evening, of, november, 12, around, the, same, time, as, the, local, high, tide, once, over, land, the, system, began, to, weaken, the, storm, degraded, to, a, cyclonic, storm, on, november, 13, when, it, was, about, 100, km, 62, mi, south, southeast, of, agartala, the, storm, then, rapidly, weakened, into, a, remnant, low, over, southern, assam, that, evening, there, is, question, as, to, how, much, of, the, information, about, the, cyclone, said, to, have, been, received, by, indian, weather, authorities, was, transmitted, to, east, pakistan, authorities, this, is, because, the, indian, and, east, pakistani, weather, services, may, not, have, shared, information, given, the, indo, pakistani, friction, at, the, time, a, large, part, of, the, population, was, reportedly, taken, by, surprise, by, the, storm, there, were, indications, that, east, pakistan, s, storm, warning, system, was, not, used, properly, the, pakistan, meteorological, department, issued, a, report, calling, for, danger, preparedness, in, the, vulnerable, coastal, regions, during, the, day, on, november, 12, as, the, storm, neared, the, coast, a, great, danger, signal, was, broadcast, on, radio, pakistan, survivors, later, said, that, this, meant, little, to, them, but, that, they, had, recognised, a, no, 1, warning, signal, as, representing, the, greatest, possible, threat, following, two, previously, destructive, cyclones, in, october, 1960, which, killed, at, least, 16, 000, people, in, east, pakistan, the, pakistani, central, government, contacted, the, american, government, for, assistance, in, developing, a, system, to, avert, future, disasters, gordon, dunn, the, director, of, the, national, hurricane, center, at, the, time, carried, out, a, detailed, study, and, submitted, his, report, in, 1961, however, the, central, government, did, not, carry, out, all, of, the, recommendations, dunn, had, listed, although, the, north, indian, ocean, is, the, least, active, of, the, tropical, cyclone, basins, the, coast, of, the, bay, of, bengal, is, particularly, vulnerable, to, the, effects, of, tropical, cyclones, the, exact, death, toll, from, the, bhola, cyclone, will, never, be, known, but, at, least, 300, 000, fatalities, were, associated, with, the, storm, possibly, as, many, as, 500, 000, the, cyclone, was, not, however, the, most, powerful, of, these, the, 1991, bangladesh, cyclone, was, significantly, stronger, when, it, made, landfall, in, the, same, general, area, as, a, category, 5, equivalent, cyclone, with, 260, km, h, 160, mph, winds, the, bhola, cyclone, is, the, deadliest, tropical, cyclone, on, record, and, also, one, of, the, deadliest, natural, disasters, in, modern, history, a, comparable, number, of, people, died, as, a, result, of, the, 1976, tangshan, earthquake, 2004, indian, ocean, earthquake, and, the, 2010, haiti, earthquake, but, because, of, uncertainty, in, the, number, of, deaths, in, all, four, disasters, it, may, never, be, known, which, one, was, the, deadliest, the, meteorological, station, in, chittagong, 95, km, 59, mi, to, the, east, of, where, the, storm, made, landfall, recorded, winds, of, 144, km, h, 89, mph, before, its, anemometer, was, blown, off, at, about, 2200, utc, on, november, 12, a, ship, anchored, in, the, port, in, the, same, area, recorded, a, peak, gust, of, 222, km, h, 138, mph, about, 45, minutes, later, as, the, storm, made, landfall, it, caused, a, 10, metre, 33, ft, high, storm, surge, at, the, ganges, delta, in, the, port, at, chittagong, the, storm, tide, peaked, at, about, 4, m, 13, ft, above, the, average, sea, level, 1, 2, m, 3, 9, ft, of, which, was, the, storm, surge, radio, pakistan, reported, that, there, were, no, survivors, on, the, thirteen, islands, near, chittagong, a, flight, over, the, area, showed, the, devastation, was, complete, throughout, the, southern, half, of, bhola, island, and, the, rice, crops, of, bhola, island, hatia, island, and, the, nearby, mainland, coastline, were, destroyed, several, seagoing, vessels, in, the, ports, of, chittagong, and, mongla, were, reported, damaged, and, the, airports, at, chittagong, and, cox, s, bazar, were, under, 1, m, 3, 3, ft, of, water, for, several, hours, over, 3, 6, million, people, were, directly, affected, by, the, cyclone, and, the, total, damage, from, the, storm, was, estimated, at, us, 86, 4, million, us, 450, million, in, 2006, dollars, the, survivors, claimed, that, approximately, 85, of, homes, in, the, area, were, destroyed, or, severely, damaged, with, the, greatest, destruction, occurring, along, the, coast, ninety, percent, of, marine, fishermen, in, the, region, suffered, heavy, losses, including, the, destruction, of, 9, 000, offshore, fishing, boats, of, the, 77, 000, onshore, fishermen, 46, 000, were, killed, by, the, cyclone, and, 40, of, the, survivors, were, affected, severely, in, total, approximately, 65, of, the, fishing, capacity, of, the, coastal, region, was, destroyed, by, the, storm, in, a, region, where, about, 80, of, the, protein, consumed, comes, from, fish, agricultural, damage, was, similarly, severe, with, the, loss, of, us, 63, million, worth, of, crops, and, 280, 000, cattle, three, months, after, the, storm, 75, of, the, population, was, receiving, food, from, relief, workers, and, over, 150, 000, relied, upon, aid, for, half, of, their, food, the, bhola, cyclone, would, also, lead, to, increased, cholera, and, typhoid, cases, in, the, region, due, to, the, contamination, of, the, water, supply, in, the, storm, many, attempts, of, sending, aid, to, the, region, were, impeded, by, the, prevalent, cholera, and, as, a, result, medical, aid, was, delayed, the, cyclone, brought, widespread, rain, to, the, andaman, and, nicobar, islands, with, very, heavy, rain, falling, in, places, on, november, 8, 9, port, blair, recorded, 130, mm, 5, 1, in, of, rain, on, november, 8, and, there, were, a, number, of, floods, on, the, islands, mv, mahajagmitra, a, 5, 500, ton, freighter, en, route, from, calcutta, to, kuwait, was, sunk, by, the, storm, on, november, 12, with, the, loss, of, all, fifty, people, on, board, the, ship, sent, out, a, distress, signal, and, reported, experiencing, hurricane, force, winds, before, it, sank, there, was, also, widespread, rain, in, west, bengal, and, southern, assam, the, rain, caused, damage, to, housing, and, crops, in, both, indian, states, with, the, worst, damage, occurring, in, the, southernmost, districts, two, medical, relief, surveys, were, carried, out, by, the, pakistan, seato, cholera, research, laboratory, the, first, in, november, and, the, second, in, february, and, march, the, purpose, of, the, first, survey, was, to, establish, the, immediate, medical, needs, in, the, affected, regions, and, the, second, more, detailed, survey, was, designed, as, the, basis, for, long, term, relief, and, recovery, planning, in, the, second, survey, approximately, 1, 4, of, the, area, s, population, was, studied, the, first, survey, concluded, that, the, surface, water, in, most, of, the, affected, regions, had, a, comparable, salt, content, to, that, drawn, from, wells, except, in, sudharam, where, the, water, was, almost, undrinkable, with, a, salt, content, of, up, to, 0, 5, the, mortality, was, estimated, at, 14, 2, equivalent, to, a, death, toll, of, 240, 000, cyclone, related, morbidity, was, generally, restricted, to, minor, injuries, but, a, phenomenon, dubbed, cyclone, syndrome, was, observed, this, consisted, of, severe, abrasions, on, the, limbs, and, chest, caused, by, survivors, clinging, to, trees, to, withstand, the, storm, surge, initially, there, were, fears, of, an, outbreak, of, cholera, and, typhoid, fever, in, the, weeks, following, the, storm, but, the, survey, found, no, evidence, of, an, epidemic, of, cholera, smallpox, or, any, other, disease, in, the, region, affected, by, the, storm, the, totals, from, the, second, survey, were, likely, a, considerable, underestimate, as, several, groups, were, not, included, 100, 000, migrant, workers, who, were, collecting, the, rice, harvest, families, who, were, completely, wiped, out, by, the, storm, and, those, who, had, migrated, out, of, the, region, in, the, intervening, three, months, excluding, these, groups, reduced, the, risk, of, hearsay, and, exaggeration, the, survey, concluded, that, the, overall, death, toll, was, at, minimum, 224, 000, the, worst, effects, were, felt, in, tazumuddin, where, the, mortality, was, 46, 3, corresponding, to, approximately, 77, 000, deaths, in, the, thana, alone, the, mean, mortality, throughout, the, affected, region, was, 16, 5, the, results, showed, that, the, highest, survival, rate, was, for, adult, males, aged, 15, 49, while, more, than, half, the, deaths, were, children, under, age, 10, who, only, formed, a, third, of, the, pre, cyclone, population, this, suggests, that, the, young, old, and, sick, were, at, the, highest, risk, of, perishing, in, the, cyclone, and, its, storm, surge, in, the, months, after, the, storm, the, mortality, of, the, middle, aged, was, lower, in, the, cyclone, area, than, in, the, control, region, near, dhaka, this, reflected, the, storm, s, toll, on, the, less, healthy, individuals, there, have, been, mistakes, there, have, been, delays, but, by, and, large, i, m, very, satisfied, that, everything, is, being, done, and, will, be, done, agha, muhammad, yahya, khan, the, day, after, the, storm, struck, the, coast, three, pakistani, gunboats, and, a, hospital, ship, carrying, medical, personnel, and, supplies, left, chittagong, for, the, islands, of, hatia, sandwip, and, kutubdia, teams, from, the, pakistani, army, reached, many, of, the, stricken, areas, in, the, two, days, following, the, landfall, of, the, cyclone, president, khan, visited, east, pakistan, on, the, way, back, from, a, trip, to, china, in, a, press, conference, in, dhaka, khan, accepted, the, government, had, made, slips, and, mistakes, in, their, relief, effort, for, the, cyclone, victims, of, then, east, pakistan, now, bangladesh, but, he, insisted, that, everything, was, done, within, the, limits, of, the, government, he, then, returned, to, rawalpindi, no, west, pakistani, political, leaders, visited, the, east, in, the, ten, days, following, the, cyclone, one, military, transport, aircraft, and, three, crop, dusting, aircraft, were, assigned, to, relief, work, by, the, pakistani, central, government, the, central, government, said, it, was, unable, to, transfer, military, helicopters, from, west, pakistan, as, the, indian, government, did, not, grant, clearance, to, cross, the, intervening, indian, territory, a, charge, the, indian, government, denied, by, november, 24, the, central, government, had, allocated, a, further, us, 116, million, to, finance, relief, operations, in, the, disaster, area, khan, arrived, in, dhaka, to, take, charge, of, the, relief, operations, on, november, 24, the, governor, of, east, pakistan, vice, admiral, s, m, ahsan, denied, charges, that, the, armed, forces, had, not, acted, quickly, enough, and, said, supplies, were, reaching, all, parts, of, the, disaster, area, except, for, some, small, pockets, khan, said, there, was, a, lack, of, understanding, of, the, magnitude, of, the, disaster, he, also, said, that, the, 1970, general, election, slated, for, december, 7, would, take, place, on, time, although, eight, or, nine, of, the, worst, affected, districts, might, experience, delays, denying, rumours, that, the, election, would, be, postponed, as, the, conflict, between, east, and, west, pakistan, developed, in, march, 1971, the, dhaka, offices, of, the, two, government, organisations, directly, involved, in, relief, efforts, were, closed, for, at, least, two, weeks, first, by, a, general, strike, and, then, by, a, ban, on, government, work, in, east, pakistan, by, the, awami, league, relief, work, continued, in, the, field, but, the, long, term, planning, was, curtailed, we, have, a, large, army, but, it, is, left, to, the, british, marines, to, bury, our, dead, sheikh, mujibur, rahman, political, leaders, in, east, pakistan, were, deeply, critical, of, the, central, government, s, initial, response, to, the, disaster, a, statement, released, by, eleven, east, pakistan, politicians, ten, days, after, the, storm, charged, the, government, with, gross, neglect, callous, indifference, and, utter, indifference, they, also, accused, president, khan, of, playing, down, the, news, coverage, on, november, 19, students, held, a, march, in, dhaka, in, protest, of, the, speed, of, the, government, response, and, maulana, abdul, hamid, khan, bhashani, addressed, a, rally, of, 50, 000, people, on, november, 24, when, he, accused, the, president, of, inefficiency, and, demanded, his, resignation, khan, s, political, opponents, in, west, pakistan, accused, him, of, bungling, the, efforts, and, some, demanded, his, resignation, awami, league, leader, bangabandhu, sheikh, mujibur, rahman, described, the, destruction, caused, by, the, cyclone, akin, to, a, holocaust, and, condemned, the, military, junta, s, response, as, criminal, negligence, the, pakistan, red, crescent, began, to, operate, independently, of, the, central, government, as, the, result, of, a, dispute, that, arose, after, the, red, crescent, took, possession, of, twenty, rafts, donated, by, the, british, red, cross, a, pesticide, company, had, to, wait, two, days, before, it, received, permission, for, two, of, its, crop, dusters, which, were, already, in, the, country, to, carry, out, supply, drops, in, the, affected, regions, the, central, government, only, deployed, a, single, helicopter, to, relief, operations, with, khan, later, stating, that, there, was, no, point, deploying, any, helicopters, from, west, pakistan, as, they, were, unable, to, carry, supplies, a, reporter, for, the, pakistan, observer, spent, a, week, in, the, worst, hit, areas, in, early, january, 1971, and, saw, none, of, the, tents, supplied, by, relief, agencies, being, used, to, house, survivors, and, commented, that, the, grants, for, building, new, houses, were, insufficient, the, observer, regularly, carried, front, page, stories, with, headlines, like, no, relief, coordination, while, publishing, government, statements, saying, relief, operations, are, going, smoothly, in, january, the, coldest, period, of, the, year, in, east, pakistan, the, national, relief, and, rehabilitation,

homeless, by, the, cyclone, were, receiving, up, to, 250, rupees, us, 55, in, 1971, equivalent, to, 341, in, 2018, to, rebuild, but, that, resources, were, scarce, and, he, feared, the, survivors, would, eat, the, cash, due, to, the, poor, handling, and, the, destructive, aftermath, of, the, bhola, cyclone, leftist, parties, in, both, east, and, west, pakistan, boycotted, the, 1970, pakistani, general, election, this, allowed, the, awami, league, headed, by, sheikh, mujibur, rahman, to, win, in, a, landslide, victory, the, elections, for, nine, national, assembly, and, eighteen, provincial, assembly, seats, had, to, be, postponed, until, january, 18, as, a, result, of, the, storm, the, central, government, s, handling, of, the, relief, efforts, helped, exacerbate, the, bitterness, felt, in, east, pakistan, swelling, the, resistance, movement, there, funds, only, slowly, got, through, and, transport, was, slow, in, bringing, supplies, to, the, devastated, regions, as, tensions,
