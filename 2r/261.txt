century, and, their, expansionist, campaigns, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 9th, century, eventually, the, yila, chieftain, abaoji, became, the, leader, of, the, khitans, and, proclaimed, a,

traditional, khitan, social, and, political, practices, and, han, influence, and, customs, was, a, defining, feature, of, the, dynasty, this, tension, led, to, a, series, of, succession, crises, liao, emperors, favored, the, han, concept, of, primogeniture, while, much, of, the, rest, of, the, khitan, elite, supported, the, traditional, method, of, succession, by, the, strongest, candidate, in, addition, the, adoption, of, han, systems, and, the, push, to, reform, khitan, practices, led, abaoji, to, set, up, two, parallel, governments, the, northern, administration, governed, khitan, areas,

although, cultural, achievements, associated, with, the, liao, dynasty, are, considerable, and, a, number, of, various, statuary, and, other, artifacts, exist, in, museums, and, other, collections,

khitan, state, chinese, pinyin, d, q, d, n, was, founded, in, 907, by, abaoji, emperor, taizu, of, liao, in, 947, abaoji, s, successor, emperor, taizong, of, liao, officially, renamed, the, dynasty, as, great, liao, chinese, pinyin, d, li, o, this, was, probably, due, to, the, inclusion, of, non, khitan, peoples, in, the, state, the, name, was, changed, back, to, great, khitan, in, 983, during, the, reign, of, the, emperor, shengzong, of, liao, due, to, a, reassertion, of, khitan, identity, in, 1066, emperor, daozong, of, liao, reintroduced, the, dynastic, name, great, liao, and, the, title,

yel, dashi, in, the, western, regions, also, officially, adopted, the, dynastic, name, great, liao, in, historiography, however, this, regime, is, more, commonly, called, the, western, liao, or, qara, khitai, due, to, the, dominance, of, the, khitans, during, the, liao, dynasty, in, northeast, china, and, mongolia, and, later, the, qara, khitai, in, central, asia, where, they, were, seen, as, chinese, the, term, khitai, came, to, mean, china, to, people, near, them, in, central, asia, russia, and, northwestern, china, the, name, was, then, introduced, to, medieval, europe, via, islamic, and, russian, sources, and, became, cathay, in, the, modern, era, words, related, to, khitay, are, still, used, as, a, name, for, china, by, turkic, peoples, such, as, the, uyghurs, in, china, s, xinjiang, region, and, the, kazakhs, of, kazakhstan, and, areas, adjoining, it, and, by, some, slavic, peoples, such, as, the, russians, and, bulgarians, there, is, no, consensus, among, historians, regarding, the, etymology, of, liao, some, believe, that, liao, was, derived, from, the, word, for, iron, in, the, khitan, language, while, others, believe, that, the, name, came, from, the, liao, river, catchment, which, was, the, traditional, homeland, of, the, khitan, people, the, earliest, reference, to, a, khitan, state, is, found, in, the, book, of, wei, a, history, of, the, northern, wei, dynasty, 386, 534, that, was, completed, in, 554, several, books, written, after, 554, mention, the, khitans, being, active, during, the, late, third, and, early, fourth, centuries, the, book, of, jin, 648, a, history, of, the, jin, dynasty, 266, 420, refers, to, the, khitans, in, the, section, covering, the, reign, of, murong, sheng, 398, 401, samguk, sagi, 1145, a, history, of, the,

emerged, from, the, yuwen, branch, of, the, xianbei, people, following, a, defeat, at, the, hands, of, another, branch, of, the, xianbei, in, 345, the, yuwen, split, into, three, tribes, one, of,

partially, backed, up, by, the, book, of, wei, which, describes, the, khitans, being, of, xianbei, origins, beginning, in, the, song, dynasty, some, chinese, scholars, suggested, that, the, khitans, might, have, descended, from, the, xiongnu, people, while, modern, historians, have, rejected, the, idea, that, the, khitan, were, solely, xiongnu, in, origin, there, is, some, support, for, the, claim, that, they, are, of, mixed, xianbei, and, xiongnu, origin, beginning, with, rashid, al, din, hamadani, in, the, fourteenth, century, several, scholars, have, theorized, that, the, khitans, were, mongolic, in, origin, and, in, the, late, 19th, century, western, scholars, made, the, claim, that, the, khitans, were, tungusic, in, origin, modern, linguistic, analysis, has, discredited, this, claim, after, splitting, from, the, yuwen, the, khitans, and, kumo, xi, fled, to, the, region, of, songmo, modern, southern, hexigten, banner, and, western, ongniud, banner, according, to, the,

the, song, dynasty, but, the, liao, court, refused, the, liao, cemented, its, relations, with, the, tanguts, with, a, marriage, alliance, and, sent, an, envoy, requesting, the, song, to, stop, its,

1112, despite, international, peace, on, several, fronts, the, liao, dynasty, would, fall, to, the, jurchens, by, 1125, the, jurchens, were, a, tungusic, people, who, lived, in, fragmented, tribes, stretching, northward, from, the, border, of, goryeo, they, had, been, in, contact, with, the, khitans, ever, since, abaoji, s, rise, to, power, despite, their, marginal, status, they, were, militarily, significant, enough, that, the, song, considered, them, a, potential, ally, against, the, liao, and, periodically, caused, trouble, for, the, khitans, the, liao, categorized, the, jurchens, into, three, groups, civilized, jurchens, shu, n, zhi, descended, from, tribes, captured, by, the, liao, in, the, 10th, century, and, assimilated, into, khitan, society, obedient, jurchens, shun, n, zhi, subordinate, to, the, liao, and, had, regular, contact, with, the, court, and, wild, jurchens, sheng, n, zhi, who, inhabited, the, lower, songhua, river, valley, and, the, eastern, mountains, of, modern, heilongjiang, the, wild, jurchens, were, nominally, subordinate, to, the, liao, but, were, functionally, independent, during, the, 11th, century, one, of, the, wild, jurchen, clans, the, wanyan, established, dominance, over, their, neighbors, and, created, a, semblance, of, jurchen, unity, the, liao, court, recognized, this, and, conferred, on, their, chieftains, the, title, of, military, governor, as, the, wanyan, clan, consolidated, their, control, over, the, jurchens, relations, with, the, liao, also, became, increasingly, strained, the, jurchens, resented, the, behavior, of, liao, officials, at, ningjiang, the, main, border, trading, post, who, constantly, cheated, them, the, liao, also, placed, on, them, the, obligation, of, supplying, the, liao, emperor, with, gyrfalcons, called, haidongqing, only, bred, on, the, coastal, regions, and, required, the, jurchens, to, fight, across, the, territory, of, their, neighbors, the, five, nations, to, access, liao, envoys, also, habitually, beat, their, village, elders, and, abused, their, women, one, of, the, primary, causes, of, the, jurchen, rebellion, was, the, custom, of, raping, married, jurchen, women, and, jurchen, girls, by, khitan, envoys, which, caused, resentment, from, the, jurchens, the, custom, of, having, sex, with, unmarried, girls, by, khitan, was, itself, not, a, problem, since, the, practice, of, guest, prostitution, giving, female, companions, food, and, shelter, to, guests, was, common, among, jurchens, unmarried, daughters, of, jurchen, families, of, lower, and, middle, classes, in, jurchen, villages, were, provided, to, khitan, messengers, for, sex, as, recorded, by, hong, hao, song, envoys, among, the, jin, were, similarly, entertained, by, singing, girls, in, guide, henan, there, is, no, evidence, that, guest, prostitution, of, unmarried, jurchen, girls, to, khitan, men, was, resented, by, the, jurchens, it, was, only, when, the, khitans, forced, aristocratic, jurchen, families, to, give, up, their, beautiful, wives, as, guest, prostitutes, to, khitan, messengers, that, the, jurchens, became, resentful, this, suggests, that, in, jurchen, upper, classes, only, a, husband, had, the, right, to, his, married, wife, while, among, lower, class, jurchens, the, virginity, of, unmarried, girls, and, sex, with, khitan, men, did, not, impede, their, ability, to, marry, later, the, jurchen, problem, reared, its, head, in, late, 1112, when, tianzuo, embarked, on, a, fishing, expedition, to, the, huntong, river, modern, songhua, river, where, the, jurchen, tribes, were, expected, to, pay, homage, to, the, emperor, as, a, symbolic, gesture, of, obeisance, the, jurchen, chieftains, were, supposed, to, get, up, in, turn, and, dance, in, the,
