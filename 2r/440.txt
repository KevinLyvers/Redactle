collective, farming, and, communal, farming, are, various, types, of, agricultural, production, in, which, multiple, farmers, run, their, holdings, as, a, joint, enterprise, there, are, two, broad, types, of, communal, farms, agricultural, cooperatives, in, which, member, owners, jointly, engage, in, farming, activities, as, a, collective, and, state, farms, which, are, owned, and, directly, run, by, a, centralized, government, the, process, by, which, farmland, is, aggregated, is, called, collectivization, in, some, countries, including, the, soviet, union, the, eastern, bloc, countries, china, and, vietnam, there, have, been, both, state, run, and, cooperative, run, variants, for, example, the, soviet, union, had, both, kolkhozy, cooperative, run, farms, and, sovkhozy, state, run, farms, under, the, aztec, empire, central, mexico, was, divided, into, small, territories, called, calpulli, which, were, units, of, local, administration, concerned, with, farming, as, well, as, education, and, religion, a, calpulli, consisted, of, a, number, of, large, extended, families, with, a, presumed, common, ancestor, themselves, each, composed, of, a, number, of, nuclear, families, each, calpulli, owned, the, land, and, granted, the, individual, families, the, right, to, farm, parts, of, it, each, day, when, the, spanish, conquered, mexico, they, replaced, this, with, a, system, of, estates, granted, by, the, spanish, crown, to, spanish, colonists, as, well, as, the, encomienda, a, feudal, like, right, of, overlordship, colonists, were, given, in, particular, villages, and, the, repartimiento, or, system, of, indigenous, forced, labor, following, the, mexican, revolution, a, new, constitution, in, 1917, abolished, any, remnant, of, feudal, like, rights, hacienda, owners, had, over, common, lands, and, offered, the, development, of, ejidos, communal, farms, formed, on, land, purchased, from, the, large, estates, by, the, mexican, government, the, huron, had, an, essentially, communal, system, of, land, ownership, the, french, catholic, missionary, gabriel, sagard, described, the, fundamentals, the, huron, had, as, much, land, as, they, need, as, a, result, the, huron, could, give, families, their, own, land, and, still, have, a, large, amount, of, excess, land, owned, communally, any, huron, was, free, to, clear, the, land, and, farm, on, the, basis, of, usufruct, he, maintained, possession, of, the, land, as, long, as, he, continued, to, actively, cultivate, and, tend, the, fields, once, he, abandoned, the, land, it, reverted, to, communal, ownership, and, anyone, could, take, it, up, for, themselves, while, the, huron, did, seem, to, have, lands, designated, for, the, individual, the, significance, of, this, possession, may, be, of, little, relevance, the, placement, of, corn, storage, vessels, in, the, longhouses, which, contained, multiple, families, in, one, kinship, group, suggests, the, occupants, of, a, given, longhouse, held, all, production, in, common, the, iroquois, had, a, similar, communal, system, of, land, distribution, the, tribe, owned, all, lands, but, gave, out, tracts, to, the, different, clans, for, further, distribution, among, households, for, cultivation, the, land, would, be, redistributed, among, the, households, every, few, years, and, a, clan, could, request, a, redistribution, of, tracts, when, the, clan, mothers, council, gathered, those, clans, that, abused, their, allocated, land, or, otherwise, did, not, take, care, of, it, would, be, warned, and, eventually, punished, by, the, clan, mothers, council, by, having, the, land, redistributed, to, another, clan, land, property, was, really, only, the, concern, of, the, women, since, it, was, the, women, s, job, to, cultivate, food, and, not, the, men, s, the, clan, mothers, council, also, reserved, certain, areas, of, land, to, be, worked, by, the, women, of, all, the, different, clans, food, from, such, lands, called, k, ndi, gw, ge, hodi, y, n, tho, would, be, used, at, festivals, and, large, council, gatherings, the, obshchina, russian, ipa, literally, commune, or, mir, russian, literally, society, one, of, the, meanings, or, selskoye, obshestvo, russian, rural, community, official, term, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, century, were, peasant, communities, as, opposed, to, individual, farmsteads, or, khutors, in, imperial, russia, the, term, derives, from, the, word, obshchiy, common, the, vast, majority, of, russian, peasants, held, their, land, in, communal, ownership, within, a, mir, community, which, acted, as, a, village, government, and, a, cooperative, arable, land, was, divided, into, sections, based, on, soil, quality, and, distance, from, the, village, each, household, had, the, right, to, claim, one, or, more, strips, from, each, section, depending, on, the, number, of, adults, in, the, household, the, purpose, of, this, allocation, was, not, so, much, social, to, each, according, to, his, needs, as, it, was, practical, that, each, person, pay, his, taxes, strips, were, periodically, re, allocated, on, the, basis, of, a, census, to, ensure, equitable, share, of, the, land, this, was, enforced, by, the, state, which, had, an, interest, in, the, ability, of, households, to, pay, their, taxes, the, soviet, union, introduced, collective, farming, in, its, constituent, republics, between, 1927, and, 1933, the, baltic, states, and, most, of, the, eastern, bloc, except, poland, adopted, collective, farming, after, world, war, ii, with, the, accession, of, communist, regimes, to, power, in, asia, people, s, republic, of, china, north, korea, laos, and, vietnam, the, adoption, of, collective, farming, was, also, driven, by, communist, government, policies, leon, trotsky, and, the, opposition, bloc, had, originally, advocated, a, programme, of, industrialization, which, also, proposed, agricultural, cooperatives, and, the, formation, of, collective, farms, on, a, voluntary, basis, according, to, sheila, fitzpatrick, the, scholarly, consensus, was, that, stalin, appropriated, the, position, of, the, left, opposition, on, such, matters, as, industrialisation, and, collectivisation, other, scholars, have, argued, the, economic, programme, of, trotsky, differed, from, the, forced, policy, of, collectivisation, implemented, by, stalin, after, 1928, due, to, the, levels, of, brutality, associated, with, its, enforcement, as, part, of, the, first, five, year, plan, forced, collectivization, was, introduced, in, the, soviet, union, by, general, secretary, joseph, stalin, in, the, late, 1920s, as, a, way, according, to, the, policies, of, socialist, leaders, to, boost, agricultural, production, through, the, organization, of, land, and, labor, into, large, scale, collective, farms, kolkhozy, at, the, same, time, joseph, stalin, argued, that, collectivization, would, free, poor, peasants, from, economic, servitude, under, the, kulaks, farmland, owners, the, soviet, communist, party, resorted, to, the, execution, and, mass, deportation, of, defiant, kulaks, to, siberia, in, order, to, implement, the, plan, see, dekulakization, the, centuries, old, system, of, farming, was, destroyed, in, ukraine, in, 1932, 1933, an, estimated, 11, million, people, 3, 7, million, in, ukraine, alone, died, from, famine, after, stalin, forced, the, peasants, into, collectives, see, holodomor, it, was, not, until, 1940, that, agricultural, production, finally, surpassed, its, pre, collectivization, levels, collectivization, throughout, the, moldavian, soviet, socialist, republic, was, not, aggressively, pursued, until, the, early, 1960s, because, of, the, soviet, leadership, s, focus, on, a, policy, of, russification, of, moldavians, into, the, russian, way, of, life, much, of, the, collectivization, in, moldova, had, undergone, in, transnistria, in, chi, in, u, the, present, day, capital, city, of, moldova, most, of, the, directors, who, regulated, and, conducted, the, process, of, collectivization, were, placed, by, officials, from, moscow, the, efficiency, of, collective, farms, in, the, ussr, is, debatable, a, soviet, article, in, march, 1975, found, that, 27, of, the, total, value, of, soviet, agricultural, produce, was, produced, by, privately, farmed, plots, despite, the, fact, that, they, only, consisted, of, less, than, 1, of, arable, land, approximately, 20, million, acres, making, them, roughly, 40, times, more, efficient, than, collective, farms, in, 1935, the, establishment, of, personal, subsidiary, farms, lph, on, collective, land, was, allowed, in, the, range, of, 25, 1, hectare, private, cattle, ownership, existed, after, 1935, but, was, severely, restricted, by, decree, in, 1956, in, romania, land, collectivization, began, in, 1948, and, continued, for, over, more, than, a, decade, until, its, virtual, eradication, in, 1962, in, romania, force, sometimes, had, to, be, used, to, enforce, collective, agricultural, practices, collective, farming, in, romania, was, an, attempt, to, implement, the, ussr, s, communist, blueprint, these, attempts, often, fell, short, by, strictly, adhering, to, this, soviet, blueprint, the, implementation, of, communism, in, romania, inevitably, created, dilemmas, and, contributions, that, led, to, violence, kligman, and, verdery, state, the, violence, collectivization, emerges, then, less, as, an, abhoration, than, as, a, product, of, sociocultural, shaping, and, of, deep, problems, with, how, the, soviet, blueprint, came, to, be, implemented, instead, of, a, gradual, and, integrated, process, of, moving, from, one, form, of, society, to, another, romanian, society, in, the, soviet, orbit, was, being, completely, rearticulated, a, process, in, which, violence, was, inevitable, on, the, other, hand, as, kligman, and, verdery, explain, collectivization, brought, undeniable, benefits, to, some, rural, inhabitants, especially, those, who, had, owned, little, or, no, land, it, freed, them, from, laboring, on, the, fields, of, others, and, it, increased, their, control, over, wages, lending, to, their, daily, existence, a, stability, previously, unknown, to, them, collective, farms, in, the, people, s, republic, of, bulgaria, introduced, in, 1945, were, called, labour, cooperative, agricultural, holdings, bulgarian, romanized, trudovo, kooperativno, zemedelsko, stopanstvo, in, hungary, agricultural, collectivization, was, attempted, a, number, of, times, between, 1948, and, 1956, with, disastrous, results, until, it, was, finally, successful, in, the, early, 1960s, under, j, nos, k, d, r, the, first, serious, attempt, at, collectivization, based, on, stalinist, agricultural, policy, was, undertaken, in, july, 1948, both, economic, and, direct, police, pressure, were, used, to, coerce, peasants, to, join, cooperatives, but, large, numbers, opted, instead, to, leave, their, villages, by, the, early, 1950s, only, one, quarter, of, peasants, had, agreed, to, join, cooperatives, in, the, spring, of, 1955, the, drive, for, collectivization, was, renewed, again, using, physical, force, to, encourage, membership, but, this, second, wave, also, ended, in, dismal, failure, after, the, events, of, the, 1956, hungarian, revolution, the, ruling, hungarian, socialist, workers, party, opted, for, a, more, gradual, collectivization, drive, the, main, wave, of, collectivization, occurred, between, 1959, and, 1961, and, at, the, end, of, this, period, more, than, 95, of, agricultural, land, in, hungary, had, become, the, property, of, collective, farms, in, february, 1961, the, central, committee, declared, that, collectivization, had, been, completed, in, czechoslovakia, centralized, land, reforms, after, world, war, i, allowed, for, the, distribution, of, most, of, the, land, to, peasants, and, the, poor, and, created, large, groups, of, relatively, well, to, do, farmers, though, village, poor, still, existed, these, groups, showed, no, support, for, communist, ideals, in, 1945, immediately, after, world, war, ii, new, land, reform, started, with, the, new, socialist, government, the, first, phase, involved, a, confiscation, of, properties, of, germans, hungarians, and, collaborators, with, the, nazi, regime, in, accordance, with, the, so, called, bene, decrees, the, second, phase, promulgated, by, so, called, uri, s, laws, after, the, communist, minister, of, agriculture, in, fact, meant, a, complete, revision, of, the, pre, war, land, reform, and, tried, to, reduce, maximal, private, property, to, 150, hectares, 370, acres, of, agricultural, land, and, 250, hectares, 620, acres, of, any, land, the, third, and, final, phase, forbade, possession, of, land, above, 50, hectares, 120, acres, for, one, family, this, phase, was, carried, out, in, april, 1948, two, months, after, the, communist, party, of, czechoslovakia, took, power, by, force, farms, started, to, be, collectivized, mostly, under, the, threat, of, sanctions, the, most, obstinate, farmers, were, persecuted, and, imprisoned, the, most, common, form, of, collectivization, was, agricultural, cooperative, czech, jednotn, zem, d, lsk, dru, stvo, jzd, slovak, jednotn, ro, n, cke, dru, stvo, jrd, the, collectivization, was, implemented, in, three, stages, 1949, 1952, 1953, 1956, 1956, 1969, and, officially, ended, with, the, 1960, implementation, of, the, constitution, establishing, the, czechoslovak, socialist, republic, which, made, private, ownership, illegal, many, early, cooperatives, collapsed, and, were, recreated, their, productivity, was, low, since, they, provided, tiny, salaries, and, no, pensions, and, they, failed, to, create, a, sense, of, collective, ownership, small, scale, pilfering, was, common, and, food, became, scarce, seeing, the, massive, outflow, of, people, from, agriculture, into, cities, the, government, started, to, massively, subsidize, the, cooperatives, in, order, to, make, the, standard, of, living, of, farmers, equal, to, that, of, city, inhabitants, this, was, the, long, term, official, policy, of, the, government, funds, machinery, and, fertilizers, were, provided, young, people, from, villages, were, forced, to, study, agriculture, and, students, were, regularly, sent, involuntarily, to, help, in, cooperatives, subsidies, and, constant, pressure, destroyed, the, remaining, private, farmers, only, a, handful, of, them, remained, after, the, 1960s, the, lifestyle, of, villagers, had, eventually, reached, the, level, of, cities, and, village, poverty, was, eliminated, czechoslovakia, was, again, able, to, produce, enough, food, for, its, citizens, the, price, of, this, success, was, a, huge, waste, of, resources, because, the, cooperatives, had, no, incentive, to, improve, efficiency, every, piece, of, land, was, cultivated, regardless, of, the, expense, involved, and, the, soil, became, heavily, polluted, with, chemicals, also, the, intensive, use, of, heavy, machinery, damaged, topsoil, furthermore, the, cooperatives, were, infamous, for, over, employment, in, the, late, 1970s, the, economy, of, czechoslovakia, entered, into, stagnation, and, the, state, owned, companies, were, unable, to, deal, with, advent, of, modern, technologies, a, few, agricultural, companies, where, the, rules, were, less, strict, than, in, state, companies, used, this, situation, to, start, providing, high, tech, products, for, example, the, only, way, to, buy, a, pc, compatible, computer, in, the, late, 1980s, was, to, get, it, for, an, extremely, high, price, from, one, agricultural, company, acting, as, a, reseller, after, the, fall, of, communism, in, czechoslovakia, in, 1989, subsidies, to, agriculture, were, halted, with, devastating, effect, most, of, the, cooperatives, had, problems, competing, with, technologically, advanced, foreign, competition, and, were, unable, to, obtain, investment, to, improve, their, situation, quite, a, large, percentage, of, them, collapsed, the, others, that, remained, were, typically, insufficiently, funded, lacking, competent, management, without, new, machinery, and, living, from, day, to, day, employment, in, the, agricultural, sector, dropped, significantly, from, approximately, 25, of, the, population, to, approximately, 1, collective, farms, in, the, german, democratic, republic, were, typically, called, landwirtschaftliche, produktionsgenossenschaft, lpg, and, corresponded, closely, to, the, soviet, kolkhoz, east, germany, also, had, a, few, state, owned, farms, which, were, equivalent, to, the, soviet, sovkhoz, which, were, called, the, volkseigenes, gut, veg, the, structure, of, farms, in, what, was, called, east, elbia, until, german, partition, was, dominated, by, latifundia, and, thus, the, land, reform, which, was, justified, on, denazification, grounds, and, with, the, aim, of, destroying, the, prussian, junker, class, which, had, been, hated, by, the, left, during, the, weimar, republic, and, which, was, blamed, for, prussian, militarism, and, the, authoritarian, tendencies, of, the, german, empire, and, later, nazi, germany, was, initially, popular, with, many, small, farmers, and, landless, peasants, east, german, president, wilhelm, pieck, coined, the, slogan, junkerland, in, bauernhand, junker, land, into, farmer, s, hand, to, promote, land, reform, which, was, initially, pledged, to, be, more, moderate, than, full, scale, collectivization, although, the, ruling, socialist, unity, party, and, the, soviet, military, administration, in, germany, promised, to, allow, large, landowners, to, keep, their, land, they, were, expelled, as, the, lpg, were, introduced, in, 1953, after, 1959, all, farmers, were, required, to, surrender, independently, owned, land, and, join, the, lpgs, similarly, to, the, soviet, union, ultimately, most, of, the, land, was, transferred, into, de, jure, or, de, facto, state, controlled, entities, with, the, former, farmers, becoming, employees, now, of, the, state, instead, of, the, erstwhile, junker, class, the, polish, name, of, a, collective, farm, was, rolnicza, sp, dzielnia, produkcyjna, agricultural, production, cooperative, collectivisation, in, poland, was, stopped, in, 1956, later, nationalisation, was, supported, collective, farming, was, introduced, as, a, league, of, communists, of, yugoslavia, government, policy, throughout, the, socialist, federal, republic, of, yugoslavia, after, world, war, ii, by, taking, away, land, from, wealthy, pre, war, owners, and, limiting, possessions, in, private, ownership, first, to, 25, and, later, to, 10, hectares, the, large, state, owned, farms, were, known, as, agricultural, cooperatives, zemljoradni, ke, zadruge, in, serbo, croatian, and, farmers, working, on, them, had, to, meet, production, quotas, in, order, to, satisfy, the, needs, of, the, populace, this, system, was, largely, abolished, in, the, 1950s, see, law, of, 23, august, 1945, with, amendments, until, 1, december, 1948, at, the, end, of, the, land, reform, movement, individual, families, in, china, owned, the, land, they, farmed, paid, taxes, as, households, and, sold, grain, at, prices, set, by, the, state, 109, rural, collectivization, began, soon, after, the, ccp, announced, its, 1953, general, line, for, the, transition, to, socialism, over, the, next, six, years, collectivization, took, several, incrementally, progressing, forms, mutual, aid, groups, primitive, cooperatives, and, people, s, communes, as, london, school, of, economics, and, political, science, professor, lin, chun, notes, researchers, agree, that, communization, proceeded, on, a, largely, voluntary, basis, that, avoided, both, the, violence, and, sabotage, that, occurred, during, the, soviet, collectivization, like, professor, barry, naughton, she, observes, that, china, s, collectivization, proceeded, smoothly, in, part, because, unlike, the, soviet, experience, a, network, of, state, institutions, already, existed, in, the, countryside, similarly, professor, edward, friedman, describes, china, s, collectivization, process, as, a, miracle, of, miracles, during, 1954, 1955, farmers, in, many, areas, began, pooling, their, land, capital, resources, and, labor, into, beginning, level, agricultural, producers, cooperatives, chuji, nongye, hezuoshe, 109, in, the, complex, system, of, beginning, level, agricultural, producers, cooperatives, farmers, received, a, share, of, the, harvest, based, on, a, combination, of, how, much, labor, and, how, much, land, they, contributed, to, the, cooperative, 109, 110, by, june, 1956, over, 60, of, rural, households, had, been, collectivized, into, higher, level, agricultural, producers, cooperatives, gaoji, nongye, hezuoshe, a, structure, that, was, similar, to, soviet, collective, farmering, via, kolkhozy, 110, in, these, cooperatives, tens, of, households, pooled, land, and, draft, animals, 110, adult, members, of, the, cooperative, were, credited, with, work, points, based, on, how, much, labor, they, had, provided, at, which, tasks, 110, at, the, end, of, the, year, the, collective, deducted, taxes, and, fixed, price, sales, to, the, state, and, the, cooperative, retained, seed, for, the, next, year, as, well, as, some, investment, and, welfare, funds, 110, the, collective, then, distributed, to, the, households, the, remainder, of, the, harvest, and, some, of, the, money, received, from, sales, to, the, state, 110, the, distribution, was, based, partly, on, work, points, accrued, by, the, adult, members, of, a, household, and, partly, at, a, standard, rate, by, age, and, sex, 110, these, cooperatives, also, lent, small, amounts, of, land, back, to, households, individually, on, which, the, households, could, grow, crops, to, consume, directly, or, sell, at, market, 110, 111, apart, from, the, large, scale, communization, during, the, great, leap, forward, higher, level, agricultural, producers, collective, were, generally, the, dominant, form, of, rural, collectivization, in, china, 111, during, the, great, leap, forward, the, mao, zedong, led, communist, party, rapidly, convert, the, chinese, economy, to, a, socialist, society, through, rapid, industrialization, and, large, scale, collectivization, later, the, country, was, hit, by, massive, floods, and, droughts, this, combined, with, the, usage, of, severely, flawed, policies, of, lysenkoism, and, the, four, pests, campaign, caused, the, great, chinese, famine, of, 1959, where, nearly, 30, million, people, died, of, hunger, the, party, officially, blamed, floods, and, droughts, for, the, famine, however, it, was, clear, to, the, party, members, at, the, party, meetings, that, famine, was, caused, mostly, by, their, own, policies, recent, studies, also, demonstrate, that, it, was, career, incentives, within, the, politburo, system, as, well, as, political, radicalism, that, led, to, the, great, famine, collectivization, of, land, via, the, commune, system, facilitated, china, s, rapid, industrialization, through, the, state, s, control, of, food, production, and, procurement, this, allowed, the, state, to, accelerate, the, process, of, capital, accumulation, ultimately, laying, the, successful, foundation, of, physical, and, human, capital, for, the, economic, growth, of, china, s, reform, and, opening, up, during, the, early, and, middle, 1950s, collectivization, was, an, important, factor, in, the, major, change, in, chinese, agriculture, during, that, period, the, dramatic, increase, in, irrigated, land, 111, for, example, collectivization, was, a, factor, that, contributed, to, the, introduction, of, double, cropping, in, the, south, a, labor, intensive, process, which, greatly, increased, agricultural, yields, 116, both, land, reform, movement, and, collectivization, largely, left, in, place, the, social, systems, in, the, ethnic, minority, group, areas, of, chinese, central, asia, and, zomia, 118, these, areas, generally, underwent, collectivization, in, the, form, of, agricultural, producers, cooperatives, during, winter, of, 1957, through, 1958, having, skipped, the, small, peasant, landholder, stage, that, had, followed, land, reform, elsewhere, in, china, 122, central, tibet, was, under, the, joint, administration, of, the, people, s, liberation, army, and, the, dalai, lama, s, theocracy, until, 1959, and, consequently, did, not, experience, land, reform, or, collectivization, until, 1960, in, agricultural, areas, and, 1966, in, pastoral, areas, 119, after, the, death, of, mao, zedong, deng, xiaoping, reformed, the, collective, farming, method, from, this, time, nearly, all, chinese, crops, began, to, blossom, not, just, grain, the, reform, included, the, removal, of, land, from, rich, land, owners, for, use, of, agricultural, land, for, peasants, but, not, ownership, this, policy, increased, production, and, helped, reverse, the, effects, of, the, great, leap, forward, the, two, main, reasons, why, china, succeeded, was, because, 1, the, government, chose, to, make, gradual, changes, which, kept, the, monopoly, of, the, chinese, communist, party, and, 2, because, the, reform, process, began, from, the, bottom, and, later, expanded, to, the, top, throughout, the, reform, process, the, communist, party, reacted, positively, to, the, bottom, up, reform, initiatives, that, emerged, from, the, rural, population, deng, xiaoping, described, the, reform, process, as, fording, the, river, by, feeling, for, the, stones, this, statement, refers, to, the, chinese, people, who, called, for, the, reforms, they, wanted, by, placing, the, stones, at, his, feet, and, he, would, then, just, approve, the, reforms, the, people, wanted, the, peasants, started, their, own, household, responsibility, system, apart, from, the, government, after, chinese, trade, was, privately, deemed, successful, all, deng, had, to, do, was, approve, its, legalization, this, increased, competition, between, farmers,
