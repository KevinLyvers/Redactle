soldiers, to, wage, war, against, muslims, in, the, philippines, and, to, found, the, city, of, zamboanga, upon, the, conquests, of, the, sultanates, of, sulu, and, maguindanao, in, this, situation, genoese, bankers, were, thus, active, in, spain, s, mediterranean, and, new, world, possessions, peru, mexico, and, philippines, the, genoese, banker, ambrogio, spinola, marquess, of, los, balbases, for, instance, raised, and, led, an, army, that, fought, in, the, eighty, years, war, in, the, netherlands, in, the, early, 17th, century, the, decline, of, spain, in, the, 17th, century, brought, also, the, renewed, decline, of, genoa, and, the, spanish, crown, s, frequent, bankruptcies, in, particular, ruined, many, of, genoa, s, merchant, houses, in, 1684, the, city, was, heavily, bombarded, by, a, french, fleet, as, punishment, for, its, alliance, with, spain, in, may, 1625, a, french, savoian, army, briefly, laid, siege, to, genoa, though, it, was, eventually, lifted, with, the, aid, of, the, spanish, the, french, would, later, bombard, the, city, in, may, 1684, for, its, support, of, spain, during, the, war, of, the, reunions, in, between, a, plague, killed, as, many, as, half, of, the, inhabitants, of, genoa, in, 1656, 57, genoa, continued, its, slow, decline, well, into, the, 18th, century, losing, its, last, mediterranean, colony, the, island, fortress, of, tabarka, to, the, bey, of, tunis, in, 1742, in, a, climate, of, constant, economic, and, power, decline, in, 1729, the, republic, had, to, face, another, revolt, in, corsica, it, is, considered, the, first, moment, of, real, rupture, between, the, island, and, the, genoese, republic, perhaps, the, most, important, because, the, representatives, of, the, church, in, full, harmony, with, the, roman, curia, justified, the, war, this, time, the, genoese, government, requested, the, help, of, charles, vi, who, sent, 10, 000, german, infantry, of, the, imperial, army, after, the, payment, by, genoa, of, 60, 000, florins, and, 100, scudi, for, each, dead, soldier, joining, the, republic, s, soldiers, commanded, by, camillo, doria, genoa, managed, to, contain, the, rebellion, however, this, did, not, prove, lasting, another, revolt, broke, out, in, 1733, causing, the, genoese, to, again, appeal, to, the, emperor, but, the, imperial, army, was, tied, up, against, the, french, in, the, ongoing, war, of, the, polish, succession, and, thus, declined, to, intervene, even, before, the, rebellions, genoa, s, control, of, the, island, had, been, loose, the, republic, had, effectively, demilitarized, itself, with, only, 2, 000, soldiers, all, spread, throughout, fortifications, in, liguria, for, a, mainland, population, of, about, half, a, million, and, law, and, order, on, corsica, were, very, weak, with, nearly, 900, homicides, per, 100, 000, people, there, annually, from, 1701, to, 1733, the, genoese, government, tried, to, ban, private, firearm, ownership, on, corsica, without, success, a, guerilla, war, would, continue, on, the, island, until, it, was, sold, to, france, in, 1768, the, convention, of, turin, of, 1742, in, which, austria, allied, with, the, kingdom, of, sardinia, caused, some, consternation, in, the, republic, however, when, this, provisional, relationship, was, given, a, more, durable, and, reliable, character, in, the, signing, of, the, treaty, of, worms, in, 1743, the, fear, of, diplomatic, isolation, had, caused, the, genoese, republic, to, abandon, its, neutrality, and, to, ally, with, the, house, of, bourbon, in, the, war, of, the, austrian, succession, consequently, the, republic, of, genoa, signed, a, secret, treaty, with, the, bourbon, allies, of, kingdom, of, france, spanish, empire, and, kingdom, of, naples, on, 26, june, 1745, the, republic, of, genoa, declared, war, on, the, kingdom, of, sardinia, this, decision, would, prove, disastrous, for, genoa, which, later, surrendered, to, the, austrians, in, september, 1746, and, was, briefly, occupied, before, a, revolt, liberated, the, city, two, months, later, the, austrians, returned, in, 1747, and, along, with, a, contingent, of, sardinian, forces, laid, siege, to, genoa, before, being, driven, off, by, the, approach, of, a, franco, spanish, army, though, genoa, retained, its, lands, in, the, peace, of, aix, la, chapelle, it, was, unable, to, keep, its, hold, on, corsica, in, its, weakened, state, after, driving, out, the, genoese, the, corsican, republic, was, declared, in, 1755, eventually, relying, on, french, intervention, to, quash, the, rebellion, genoa, was, forced, to, cede, corsica, to, the, french, in, the, 1768, treaty, of, versailles, in, 1794, and, 1795, the, revolutionary, echoes, from, france, reached, genoa, thanks, to, genoese, propagandists, and, refugees, sheltered, in, the, nearby, state, of, the, alps, and, in, 1794, a, conspiracy, against, the, aristocratic, and, oligarchic, ruling, class, developed, however, in, may, 1797, it, was, the, intent, of, the, genoese, jacobins, and, french, citizens, to, overthrow, the, government, of, the, doge, giacomo, maria, brignole, took, shape, giving, rise, to, a, fratricidal, war, in, the, streets, between, opponents, and, popular, supporters, of, the, current, customs, system, the, direct, intervention, of, napoleon, during, the, campaigns, of, 1796, and, his, representatives, in, genoa, was, the, final, act, that, led, to, the, fall, of, the, republic, in, early, june, who, overthrew, the, old, elites, which, had, ruled, the, state, for, all, of, its, history, giving, birth, to, the, ligurian, republic, on, june, 14, 1797, under, the, watchful, care, of, napoleonic, france, after, bonaparte, s, seizure, of, power, in, france, a, more, conservative, constitution, was, enacted, but, the, ligurian, republic, s, life, was, short, in, 1805, it, was, annexed, by, france, becoming, the, d, partements, of, apennins, g, nes, and, montenotte, with, the, fall, of, napoleon, and, the, subsequent, congress, of, vienna, genoa, regained, an, ephemeral, independence, with, the, name, of, the, repubblica, genovese, which, lasted, less, than, a, year, however, the, congress, established, the, annexation, of, the, territories, and, therefore, of, the, whole, of, liguria, with, the, oltregiogo, area, and, the, island, of, capraia, to, the, kingdom, of, sardinia, governed, by, the, house, of, savoy, contravening, the, principle, of, restoring, the, legitimate, governments, and, monarchies, of, the, old, republic, the, history, of, genoa, of, the, genoese, and, of, the, republic, that, held, its, fate, for, a, long, time, but, also, of, the, governments, that, gradually, took, turns, leading, the, city, to, reach, the, time, of, the, doges, is, traceable, through, the, work, of, historians, who, have, continued, the, storytelling, work, begun, at, the, end, of, the, 11th, century, by, caffaro, di, caschifellone, historian, and, himself, municipal, consul, with, the, annales, ianuenses, the, republic, of, genoa, s, governance, history, is, divided, into, five, stages, the, republic, was, substantially, democratic, in, shape, while, those, of, the, podest, s, and, the, captains, of, the, people, strongly, restored, the, often, conflicting, relationship, between, the, authority, and, the, freedom, the, perpetual, doges, on, the, other, hand, proclaimed, themselves, popular, even, though, sometimes, crossing, the, oligarchy, finally, the, fifth, republic, was, institutionally, aristocratic, by, custom, prelates, in, genoa, were, unable, to, take, on, public, office, in, the, first, two, centuries, from, the, institution, of, the, dogate, for, life, in, genoa, it, was, above, all, the, adorno, seven, doges, elected, and,
