british, victory, great, britain, france, wabanaki, confederacy, the, french, and, indian, war, 1754, 1763, was, a, theater, of, the, seven, years, war, which, pitted, the, north, american, colonies, of, the, british, empire, against, those, of, the, french, each, side, being, supported, by, various, native, american, tribes, at, the, start, of, the, war, the, french, colonies, had, a, population, of, roughly, 60, 000, settlers, compared, with, 2, million, in, the, british, colonies, the, outnumbered, french, particularly, depended, on, their, native, allies, two, years, into, the, war, in, 1756, great, britain, declared, war, on, france, beginning, the, worldwide, seven, years, war, many, view, the, french, and, indian, war, as, being, merely, the, american, theater, of, this, conflict, however, in, the, united, states, the, french, and, indian, war, is, viewed, as, a, singular, conflict, which, was, not, associated, with, any, european, war, french, canadians, call, it, the, guerre, de, la, conqu, te, war, of, the, conquest, the, british, colonists, were, supported, at, various, times, by, the, iroquois, catawba, and, cherokee, tribes, and, the, french, colonists, were, supported, by, wabanaki, confederacy, members, abenaki, and, mi, kmaq, and, the, algonquin, lenape, ojibwa, ottawa, shawnee, and, wyandot, huron, fighting, took, place, primarily, along, the, frontiers, between, new, france, and, the, british, colonies, from, the, province, of, virginia, in, the, south, to, newfoundland, in, the, north, it, began, with, a, dispute, over, control, of, the, confluence, of, the, allegheny, river, and, monongahela, river, called, the, forks, of, the, ohio, and, the, site, of, the, french, fort, duquesne, at, the, location, that, later, became, pittsburgh, pennsylvania, the, dispute, erupted, into, violence, in, the, battle, of, jumonville, glen, in, may, 1754, during, which, virginia, militiamen, under, the, command, of, 22, year, old, george, washington, ambushed, a, french, patrol, in, 1755, six, colonial, governors, met, with, general, edward, braddock, the, newly, arrived, british, army, commander, and, planned, a, four, way, attack, on, the, french, none, succeeded, and, the, main, effort, by, braddock, proved, a, disaster, he, lost, the, battle, of, the, monongahela, on, july, 9, 1755, and, died, a, few, days, later, british, operations, failed, in, the, frontier, areas, of, the, province, of, pennsylvania, and, the, province, of, new, york, during, 1755, 57, due, to, a, combination, of, poor, management, internal, divisions, effective, canadien, scouts, french, regular, forces, and, native, warrior, allies, in, 1755, the, british, captured, fort, beaus, jour, on, the, border, separating, nova, scotia, from, acadia, and, they, ordered, the, expulsion, of, the, acadians, 1755, 64, soon, afterwards, orders, for, the, deportation, were, given, by, commander, in, chief, william, shirley, without, direction, from, great, britain, the, acadians, were, expelled, both, those, captured, in, arms, and, those, who, had, sworn, the, loyalty, oath, to, the, king, natives, likewise, were, driven, off, the, land, to, make, way, for, settlers, from, new, england, the, british, pitt, government, fell, due, to, disastrous, campaigns, in, 1757, including, a, failed, expedition, against, louisbourg, and, the, siege, of, fort, william, henry, this, last, was, followed, by, the, natives, torturing, and, massacring, their, colonial, victims, william, pitt, came, to, power, and, significantly, increased, british, military, resources, in, the, colonies, at, a, time, when, france, was, unwilling, to, risk, large, convoys, to, aid, the, limited, forces, that, they, had, in, new, france, preferring, to, concentrate, their, forces, against, prussia, and, its, allies, who, were, now, engaged, in, the, seven, years, war, in, europe, the, conflict, in, ohio, ended, in, 1758, with, the, british, american, victory, in, the, ohio, country, between, 1758, and, 1760, the, british, military, launched, a, campaign, to, capture, french, canada, they, succeeded, in, capturing, territory, in, surrounding, colonies, and, ultimately, the, city, of, quebec, 1759, the, following, year, the, british, were, victorious, in, the, montreal, campaign, in, which, the, french, ceded, canada, in, accordance, with, the, treaty, of, paris, 1763, france, also, ceded, its, territory, east, of, the, mississippi, to, great, britain, as, well, as, french, louisiana, west, of, the, mississippi, river, to, its, ally, spain, in, compensation, for, spain, s, loss, to, britain, of, spanish, florida, spain, had, ceded, florida, to, britain, in, exchange, for, the, return, of, havana, cuba, france, s, colonial, presence, north, of, the, caribbean, was, reduced, to, the, islands, of, saint, pierre, and, miquelon, confirming, great, britain, s, position, as, the, dominant, colonial, power, in, northern, america, in, british, america, wars, were, often, named, after, the, sitting, british, monarch, such, as, king, william, s, war, or, queen, anne, s, war, there, had, already, been, a, king, george, s, war, in, the, 1740s, during, the, reign, of, king, george, ii, so, british, colonists, named, this, conflict, after, their, opponents, and, it, became, known, as, the, french, and, indian, war, this, continues, as, the, standard, name, for, the, war, in, the, united, states, although, indigenous, peoples, fought, on, both, sides, of, the, conflict, it, also, led, into, the, seven, years, war, overseas, a, much, larger, conflict, between, france, and, great, britain, that, did, not, involve, the, american, colonies, some, historians, make, a, connection, between, the, french, and, indian, war, and, the, seven, years, war, overseas, but, most, residents, of, the, united, states, consider, them, as, two, separate, conflicts, only, one, of, which, involved, the, american, colonies, and, american, historians, generally, use, the, traditional, name, less, frequently, used, names, for, the, war, include, the, fourth, intercolonial, war, and, the, great, war, for, the, empire, in, europe, the, french, and, indian, war, is, conflated, into, the, seven, years, war, and, not, given, a, separate, name, seven, years, refers, to, events, in, europe, from, the, official, declaration, of, war, in, 1756, two, years, after, the, french, and, indian, war, had, started, to, the, signing, of, the, peace, treaty, in, 1763, the, french, and, indian, war, in, america, by, contrast, was, largely, concluded, in, six, years, from, the, battle, of, jumonville, glen, in, 1754, to, the, capture, of, montreal, in, 1760, canadians, conflate, both, the, european, and, american, conflicts, into, the, seven, years, war, guerre, de, sept, ans, french, canadians, also, use, the, term, war, of, conquest, guerre, de, la, conqu, te, since, it, is, the, war, in, which, new, france, was, conquered, by, the, british, and, became, part, of, the, british, empire, in, quebec, this, term, was, promoted, by, popular, historians, jacques, lacoursi, re, and, denis, vaugeois, who, borrowed, from, the, ideas, of, maurice, s, guin, in, considering, this, war, as, a, dramatic, tipping, point, of, french, canadian, identity, and, nationhood, at, this, time, north, america, east, of, the, mississippi, river, was, largely, claimed, by, either, great, britain, or, france, large, areas, had, no, colonial, settlements, the, french, population, numbered, about, 75, 000, and, was, heavily, concentrated, along, the, st, lawrence, river, valley, with, some, also, in, acadia, present, day, new, brunswick, and, parts, of, nova, scotia, including, le, royale, cape, breton, island, fewer, lived, in, new, orleans, biloxi, mississippi, mobile, alabama, and, small, settlements, in, the, illinois, country, hugging, the, east, side, of, the, mississippi, river, and, its, tributaries, french, fur, traders, and, trappers, traveled, throughout, the, st, lawrence, and, mississippi, watersheds, did, business, with, local, indian, tribes, and, often, married, indian, women, traders, married, daughters, of, chiefs, creating, high, ranking, unions, british, settlers, outnumbered, the, french, 20, to, 1, with, a, population, of, about, 1, 5, million, ranged, along, the, atlantic, coast, of, the, continent, from, nova, scotia, and, the, colony, of, newfoundland, in, the, north, to, the, province, of, georgia, in, the, south, many, of, the, older, colonies, land, claims, extended, arbitrarily, far, to, the, west, as, the, extent, of, the, continent, was, unknown, at, the, time, when, their, provincial, charters, were, granted, their, population, centers, were, along, the, coast, but, the, settlements, were, growing, into, the, interior, the, british, captured, nova, scotia, from, france, in, 1713, which, still, had, a, significant, french, speaking, population, britain, also, claimed, rupert, s, land, where, the, hudson, s, bay, company, traded, for, furs, with, local, indian, tribes, between, the, french, and, british, colonists, large, areas, were, dominated, by, indian, tribes, to, the, north, the, mi, kmaq, and, the, abenakis, were, engaged, in, father, le, loutre, s, war, and, still, held, sway, in, parts, of, nova, scotia, acadia, and, the, eastern, portions, of, the, province, of, canada, as, well, as, much, of, maine, the, iroquois, confederation, dominated, much, of, upstate, new, york, and, the, ohio, country, although, ohio, also, included, algonquian, speaking, populations, of, delaware, and, shawnee, as, well, as, iroquoian, speaking, mingos, these, tribes, were, formally, under, iroquois, rule, and, were, limited, by, them, in, their, authority, to, make, agreements, the, iroquois, confederation, initially, held, a, stance, of, neutrality, to, ensure, continued, trade, with, both, french, and, british, though, maintaining, this, stance, proved, difficult, as, the, iroquois, confederation, tribes, sided, and, supported, french, or, british, causes, depending, on, which, side, provided, the, most, beneficial, trade, the, southeast, interior, was, dominated, by, siouan, speaking, catawbas, muskogee, speaking, creeks, and, choctaw, and, the, iroquoian, speaking, cherokee, tribes, when, war, broke, out, the, french, colonists, used, their, trading, connections, to, recruit, fighters, from, tribes, in, western, portions, of, the, great, lakes, region, which, was, not, directly, subject, to, the, conflict, between, the, french, and, british, these, included, the, hurons, mississaugas, ojibwas, winnebagos, and, potawatomi, the, british, colonists, were, supported, in, the, war, by, the, iroquois, six, nations, and, also, by, the, cherokees, until, differences, sparked, the, anglo, cherokee, war, in, 1758, in, 1758, the, province, of, pennsylvania, successfully, negotiated, the, treaty, of, easton, in, which, a, number, of, tribes, in, the, ohio, country, promised, neutrality, in, exchange, for, land, concessions, and, other, considerations, most, of, the, other, northern, tribes, sided, with, the, french, their, primary, trading, partner, and, supplier, of, arms, the, creeks, and, cherokees, were, subject, to, diplomatic, efforts, by, both, the, french, and, british, to, gain, either, their, support, or, neutrality, in, the, conflict, at, this, time, spain, claimed, only, the, province, of, florida, in, eastern, america, it, controlled, cuba, and, other, territories, in, the, west, indies, that, became, military, objectives, in, the, seven, years, war, florida, s, european, population, was, a, few, hundred, concentrated, in, st, augustine, there, were, no, french, regular, army, troops, stationed, in, america, at, the, onset, of, war, new, france, was, defended, by, about, 3, 000, troupes, de, la, marine, companies, of, colonial, regulars, some, of, whom, had, significant, woodland, combat, experience, the, colonial, government, recruited, militia, support, when, needed, the, british, had, few, troops, most, of, the, british, colonies, mustered, local, militia, companies, to, deal, with, indian, threats, generally, ill, trained, and, available, only, for, short, periods, but, they, did, not, have, any, standing, forces, virginia, by, contrast, had, a, large, frontier, with, several, companies, of, british, regulars, when, hostilities, began, the, british, colonial, governments, preferred, operating, independently, of, one, another, and, of, the, government, in, london, this, situation, complicated, negotiations, with, indian, tribes, whose, territories, often, encompassed, land, claimed, by, multiple, colonies, as, the, war, progressed, the, leaders, of, the, british, army, establishment, tried, to, impose, constraints, and, demands, on, the, colonial, administrations, new, france, s, governor, general, roland, michel, barrin, de, la, galissoni, re, was, concerned, about, the, incursion, and, expanding, influence, in, the, ohio, country, of, british, colonial, traders, such, as, george, croghan, in, june, 1747, he, ordered, pierre, joseph, c, loron, to, lead, a, military, expedition, through, the, area, its, objectives, were, c, loron, s, expedition, force, consisted, of, about, 200, troupes, de, la, marine, and, 30, indians, and, they, covered, about, 3, 000, miles, 4, 800, km, between, june, and, november, 1749, they, went, up, the, st, lawrence, continued, along, the, northern, shore, of, lake, ontario, crossed, the, portage, at, niagara, and, followed, the, southern, shore, of, lake, erie, at, the, chautauqua, portage, near, barcelona, new, york, the, expedition, moved, inland, to, the, allegheny, river, which, it, followed, to, the, site, of, pittsburgh, there, c, loron, buried, lead, plates, engraved, with, the, french, claim, to, the, ohio, country, whenever, he, encountered, british, colonial, merchants, or, fur, traders, he, informed, them, of, the, french, claims, on, the, territory, and, told, them, to, leave, c, loron, s, expedition, arrived, at, logstown, where, the, indians, in, the, area, informed, him, that, they, owned, the, ohio, country, and, that, they, would, trade, with, the, british, colonists, regardless, of, the, french, he, continued, south, until, his, expedition, reached, the, confluence, of, the, ohio, and, the, miami, rivers, which, lay, just, south, of, the, village, of, pickawillany, the, home, of, the, miami, chief, known, as, old, briton, c, loron, threatened, old, briton, with, severe, consequences, if, he, continued, to, trade, with, british, colonists, but, old, briton, ignored, the, warning, c, loron, returned, disappointedly, to, montreal, in, november, 1749, c, loron, wrote, an, extensively, detailed, report, all, i, can, say, is, that, the, natives, of, these, localities, are, very, badly, disposed, towards, the, french, he, wrote, and, are, entirely, devoted, to, the, english, i, don, t, know, in, what, way, they, could, be, brought, back, even, before, his, return, to, montreal, reports, on, the, situation, in, the, ohio, country, were, making, their, way, to, london, and, paris, each, side, proposing, that, action, be, taken, massachusetts, governor, william, shirley, was, particularly, forceful, stating, that, british, colonists, would, not, be, safe, as, long, as, the, french, were, present, the, war, of, the, austrian, succession, ended, in, 1748, with, the, signing, of, the, treaty, of, aix, la, chapelle, which,

reached, no, decision, frontier, areas, were, claimed, by, both, sides, from, nova, scotia, and, acadia, in, the, north, to, the, ohio, country, in, the, south, the, disputes, also, extended, into, the, atlantic, ocean, where, both, powers, wanted, access, to, the, rich, fisheries, of, the, grand, banks, off, newfoundland, in, 1749, the, british, government, gave, land, to, the, ohio, company, of, virginia, for, the, purpose, of, developing, trade, and, settlements, in, the, ohio, country, the, grant, required, that, it, settle, 100, families, in, the, territory, and, construct, a, fort, for, their, protection, but, the, territory, was, also, claimed, by, pennsylvania, and, both, colonies, began, pushing, for, action, to, improve, their, respective, claims, in, 1750, christopher, gist, explored, the, ohio, territory, acting, on, behalf, of, both, virginia, and, the, company, and, he, opened, negotiations, with, the, indian, tribes, at, logstown, he, completed, the, 1752, treaty, of, logstown, in, which, the, local, indians, agreed, to, terms, through, their, half, king, tanacharison, and, an, iroquois, representative, these, terms, included, permission, to, build, a, strong, house, at, the, mouth, of, the, monongahela, river, on, the, modern, site, of, pittsburgh, pennsylvania, governor, general, of, new, france, marquis, de, la, jonqui, re, died, on, march, 17,

land, in, the, ohio, valley, from, the, british, marin, followed, the, route, that, c, loron, had, mapped, out, four, years, earlier, c, loron, however, had, limited, the, record, of, french, claims, to, the, burial, of, lead, plates, whereas, marin, constructed, and, garrisoned, forts, he, first, constructed, fort, presque, isle, on, lake, erie, s, south, shore, near, erie, pennsylvania, and, he, had, a, road, built, to, the, headwaters, of, leboeuf, creek, he, then, constructed, a, second, fort, at, fort, le, boeuf, in, waterford, pennsylvania, designed, to, guard, the, headwaters, of,

traveled, to, fort, le, boeuf, and, threatened, the, french, with, military, action, which, marin, contemptuously, dismissed, the, iroquois, sent, runners, to, the, manor, of, william, johnson, in, upstate, new, york, who, was, the, british, superintendent, for, indian, affairs, in, the, new, york, region, and, beyond, johnson, was, known, to, the, iroquois, as, warraghiggey, meaning, he, who, does, great, things, he, spoke, their, languages, and, had, become, a, respected, honorary, member, of, the, iroquois, confederacy, in, the, area, and, he, was, made, a, colonel, of, the, iroquois,

obligations, and, block, french, expansion, clinton, did, not, respond, to, his, satisfaction, and, hendrick, said, that, the, covenant, chain, was, broken, a, long, standing, friendly, relationship, between, the, iroquois, confederacy, and, the, british, crown, governor, robert, dinwiddie, of, virginia, was, an, investor, in, the, ohio, company, which, stood, to, lose, money, if, the, french, held, their, claim, he, ordered, 21, year, old, major, george, washington, whose, brother, was, another, ohio, company, investor, of, the, virginia, regiment, to, warn, the, french, to, leave, virginia, territory, in, october, 1753, washington, left, with, a, small, party, picking, up, jacob, van, braam, as, an, interpreter, christopher, gist, a, company, surveyor, working, in, the, area, and, a, few, mingos, led, by, tanaghrisson, on, december, 12, washington, and, his, men, reached, fort, le, boeuf, jacques, legardeur, de, saint, pierre, succeeded, marin, as, commander, of, the, french, forces, after, marin, died, on, october, 29, and, he, invited, washington, to, dine, with, him, over, dinner, washington, presented, saint, pierre, with, the, letter, from, dinwiddie, demanding, an, immediate, french, withdrawal, from, the, ohio, country, saint, pierre, said, as, to, the, summons, you, send, me, to, retire, i, do, not, think, myself, obliged, to, obey, it, he, told, washington, that, france, s, claim, to, the, region, was, superior, to, that, of, the, british, since, ren, robert, cavelier, sieur, de, la, salle, had, explored, the, ohio, country, nearly, a, century, earlier, washington, s, party, left, fort, le, boeuf, early, on, december, 16, and, arrived, in, williamsburg, on, january, 16, 1754, he, stated, in, his, report, the, french, had, swept, south, detailing, the, steps, which, they, had, taken, to, fortify, the, area, and, their, intention, to, fortify, the, confluence, of, the, allegheny, and, monongahela, rivers, even, before, washington, returned, dinwiddie, had, sent, a, company, of, 40, men, under, william, trent, to, that, point, where, they, began, construction, of, a, small, stockaded, fort, in, the, early, months, of, 1754, governor, duquesne, sent, additional, french, forces, under, claude, pierre, p, caudy, de, contrec, ur, to, relieve, saint, pierre, during, the, same, period, and, contrec, ur, led, 500, men, south, from, fort, venango, on, april, 5, 1754, these, forces, arrived, at, the, fort, on, april, 16, but, contrec, ur, generously, allowed, trent, s, small, company, to, withdraw, he, purchased, their, construction, tools, to, continue, building, what, became, fort, duquesne, dinwiddie, had, ordered, washington, to, lead, a, larger, force, to, assist, trent, in, his, work, and, washington, learned, of, trent, s, retreat, while, he, was, en, route, mingo, sachem, tanaghrisson, had, promised, support, to, the, british, so, washington, continued, toward, fort, duquesne, and, met, with, him, he, then, learned, of, a, french, scouting, party, in, the, area, from, a, warrior, sent, by, tanaghrisson, so, he, added, tanaghrisson, s, dozen, mingo, warriors, to, his, own, party, washington, s, combined, force, of, 52, ambushed, 40, canadiens, french, colonists, of, new, france, on, the, morning, of, may, 28, in, what, became, known, as, the, battle, of, jumonville, glen, they, killed, many, of, the, canadiens, including, their, commanding, officer, joseph, coulon, de, jumonville, whose, head, was, reportedly, split, open, by, tanaghrisson, with, a, tomahawk, historian, fred, anderson, suggests, that, tanaghrisson, was, acting, to, gain, the, support, of, the, british, and, to, regain, authority, over, his, own, people, they, had, been, inclined, to, support, the, french, with, whom, they, had, long, trading, relationships, one, of, tanaghrisson, s, men, told, contrecoeur, that, jumonville, had, been, killed, by, british, musket, fire, historians, generally, consider, the, battle, of, jumonville, glen, as, the, opening, battle, of, the, french, and, indian, war, in, north, america, and, the, start, of, hostilities, in, the, ohio, valley, following, the, battle, washington, pulled, back, several, miles, and, established, fort, necessity, which, the, canadians, attacked, under, the, command, of, jumonville, s, brother, at, the, battle, of, fort, necessity, on, july, 3, washington, surrendered, and, negotiated, a, withdrawal, under, arms, one, of, his, men, reported, that, the, canadian, force, was, accompanied, by, shawnee, delaware, and, mingo, warriors, just, those, whom, tanaghrisson, was, seeking, to, influence, news, of, the, two, battles, reached, england, in, august, after, several, months, of, negotiations, the, government, of, the, duke, of, newcastle, decided, to, send, an, army, expedition, the, following, year, to, dislodge, the, french, they, chose, major, general, edward, braddock, to, lead, the, expedition, word, of, the, british, military, plans, leaked, to, france, well, before, braddock, s, departure, for, north, america, in, response, king, louis, xv, dispatched, six, regiments, to, new, france, under, the, command, of, baron, dieskau, in, 1755, the, british, sent, out, their, fleet, in, february, 1755, intending, to, blockade, french, ports, but, the, french, fleet, had, already, sailed, admiral, edward, hawke, detached, a, fast, squadron, to, north, america, in, an, attempt, to, intercept, them, in, a, second, british, action, admiral, edward, boscawen, fired, on, the, french, ship, alcide, on, june, 8, 1755, capturing, her, and, two, troop, ships, the, british, harassed, french, shipping, throughout, 1755, seizing, ships, and, capturing, seamen, these, actions, contributed, to, the, eventual, formal, declarations, of, war, in, spring, 1756, an, early, important, political, response, to, the, opening, of, hostilities, was, the, convening, of, the, albany, congress, in, june, and, july, 1754, the, goal, of, the, congress, was, to, formalize, a, unified, front, in, trade, and, negotiations, with, the, indians, since, the, allegiance, of, the, various, tribes, and, nations, was, seen, to, be, pivotal, in, the, war, that, was, unfolding, the, plan, that, the, delegates, agreed, to, was, neither, ratified, by, the, colonial, legislatures, nor, approved, by, the, crown, nevertheless, the, format, of, the, congress, and, many, specifics, of, the, plan, became, the, prototype, for, confederation, during, the, war, of, independence, the, british, formed, an, aggressive, plan, of, operations, for, 1755, general, braddock, was, to, lead, the, expedition, to, fort, duquesne, while, massachusetts, governor, william, shirley, was, given, the, task, of, fortifying, fort, oswego, and, attacking, fort, niagara, sir, william, johnson, was, to, capture, fort, st, fr, d, ric, at, crown, point, new, york, and, lieutenant, colonel, robert, monckton, was, to, capture, fort, beaus, jour, to, the, east, on, the, frontier, between, nova, scotia, and, acadia, braddock, led, about, 1, 500, army, troops, and, provincial, militia, on, the, braddock, expedition, in, june, 1755, to, take, fort, duquesne, with, george, washington, as, one, of, his, aides, the, expedition, was, a, disaster, it, was, attacked, by, french, regulars, canadian, militiamen, and, indian, warriors, ambushing, them, from, hiding, places, up, in, trees, and, behind, logs, and, braddock, called, for, a, retreat, he, was, killed, and, approximately, 1, 000, british, soldiers, were, killed, or, injured, the, remaining, 500, british, troops, retreated, to, virginia, led, by, washington, washington, and, thomas, gage, played, key, roles, in, organizing, the, retreat, two, future, opponents, in, the, american, revolutionary, war, the, british, government, initiated, a, plan, to, increase, their, military, capability, in, preparation, for, war, following, news, of, braddock, s, defeat, and, the, start, of, parliament, s, session, in, november, 1755, among, the, early, legislative, measures, were, the, recruiting, act, 1756, the, commissions, to, foreign, protestants, act, 1756, for, the, royal, american, regiment, the, navigation, act, 1756, and, the, continuance, of, laws, act, 1756, england, passed, the, naval, prize, act, 1756, following, the, proclamation, of, war, on, may, 17, to, allow, the, capture, of, ships, and, establish, privateering, the, french, acquired, a, copy, of, the, british, war, plans, including, the, activities, of, shirley, and, johnson, shirley, s, efforts, to, fortify, oswego, were, bogged, down, in, logistical, difficulties, exacerbated, by, his, inexperience, in, managing, large, expeditions, in, conjunction, he, was, made, aware, that, the, french, were, massing, for, an, attack, on, fort, oswego, in, his, absence, when, he, planned, to, attack, fort, niagara, as, a, response, he, left, garrisons, at, oswego, fort, bull, and, fort, williams, the, last, two, located, on, the, oneida, carry, between, the, mohawk, river, and, wood, creek, at, rome, new, york, supplies, were, cached, at, fort, bull, for, use, in, the, projected, attack, on, niagara, johnson, s, expedition, was, better, organized, than, shirley, s, which, was, noticed, by, new, france, s, governor, the, marquis, de, vaudreuil, vaudreuil, had, been, concerned, about, the, extended, supply, line, to, the, forts, on, the, ohio, and, he, had, sent, baron, dieskau, to, lead, the, defenses, at, frontenac, against, shirley, s, expected, attack, vaudreuil, saw, johnson, as, the, larger, threat, and, sent, dieskau, to, fort, st, fr, d, ric, to, meet, that, threat, dieskau, planned, to, attack, the, british, encampment, at, fort, edward, at, the, upper, end, of, navigation, on, the, hudson, river, but, johnson, had, strongly, fortified, it, and, dieskau, s, indian, support, was, reluctant, to, attack, the, two, forces, finally, met, in, the, bloody, battle, of, lake, george, between, fort, edward, and, fort, william, henry, the, battle, ended, inconclusively, with, both, sides, withdrawing, from, the, field, johnson, s, advance, stopped, at, fort, william, henry, and, the, french, withdrew, to, ticonderoga, point, where, they, began, the, construction, of, fort, carillon, later, renamed, fort, ticonderoga, after, the, british, captured, it, in, 1759, colonel, monckton, captured, fort, beaus, jour, in, june, 1755, in, the, sole, british, success, that, year, cutting, off, the, french, fortress, louisbourg, from, land, based, reinforcements, to, cut, vital, supplies, to, louisbourg, nova, scotia, s, governor, charles, lawrence, ordered, the, deportation, of, the, french, speaking, acadian, population, from, the, area, monckton, s, forces, including, companies, of, rogers, rangers, forcibly, removed, thousands, of, acadians, chasing, down, many, who, resisted, and, sometimes, committing, atrocities, cutting, off, supplies, to, louisbourg, led, to, its, demise, the, acadian, resistance, was, sometimes, quite, stiff, in, concert, with, indian, allies, including, the, mi, kmaq, with, ongoing, frontier, raids, against, dartmouth, and, lunenburg, among, others, the, only, clashes, of, any, size, were, at, petitcodiac, in, 1755, and, at, bloody, creek, near, annapolis, royal, in, 1757, other, than, the, campaigns, to, expel, the, acadians, ranging, around, the, bay, of, fundy, on, the, petitcodiac, and, st, john, rivers, and, le, saint, jean, following, the, death, of, braddock, william, shirley, assumed, command, of, british, forces, in, north, america, and, he, laid, out, his, plans, for, 1756, at, a, meeting, in, albany, in, december, 1755, he, proposed, renewing, the, efforts, to, capture, niagara, crown, point, and, duquesne, with, attacks, on, fort, frontenac, on, the, north, shore, of, lake, ontario, and, an, expedition, through, the, wilderness, of, the, maine, district, and, down, the, chaudi, re, river, to, attack, the, city, of, quebec, his, plan, however, got, bogged, down, by, disagreements, and, disputes, with, others, including, william, johnson, and, new, york, s, governor, sir, charles, hardy, and, consequently, gained, little, support, newcastle, replaced, him, in, january, 1756, with, lord, loudoun, with, major, general, james, abercrombie, as, his, second, in, command, neither, of, these, men, had, as, much, campaign, experience, as, the, trio, of, officers, whom, france, sent, to, north, america, french, regular, army, reinforcements, arrived, in, new, france, in, may, 1756, led, by, major, general, louis, joseph, de, montcalm, and, seconded, by, the, chevalier, de, l, vis, and, colonel, fran, ois, charles, de, bourlamaque, all, experienced, veterans, from, the, war, of, the, austrian, succession, on, may, 17, 1756, britain, formally, declared, war, on, france, which, expanded, the, war, into, europe, and, came, to, be, known, as, the, seven, years, war, governor, vaudreuil, had, ambitions, to, become, the, french, commander, in, chief, in, addition, to, his, role, as, governor, and, he, acted, during, the, winter, of, 1756, before, those, reinforcements, arrived, scouts, had, reported, the, weakness, of, the, british, supply, chain, so, he, ordered, an, attack, against, the, forts, which, shirley, had, erected, at, the, oneida, carry, in, the, battle, of, fort, bull, french, forces, destroyed, the, fort, and, large, quantities, of, supplies, including, 45, 000, pounds, of, gunpowder, they, set, back, any, british, hopes, for, campaigns, on, lake, ontario, and, endangered, the, oswego, garrison, already, short, on, supplies, french, forces, in, the, ohio, valley, also, continued, to, intrigue, with, indians, throughout, the, area, encouraging, them, to, raid, frontier, settlements, this, led, to, ongoing, alarms, along, the, western, frontiers, with, streams, of, refugees, returning, east, to, get, away, from, the, action, the, new, british, command, was, not, in, place, until, july, abercrombie, arrived, in, albany, but, refused, to, take, any, significant, actions, until, loudoun, approved, them, and, montcalm, took, bold, action, against, his, inertia, he, built, on, vaudreuil, s, work, harassing, the, oswego, garrison, and, executed, a, strategic, feint, by, moving, his, headquarters, to, ticonderoga, as, if, to, presage, another, attack, along, lake, george, with, abercrombie, pinned, down, at, albany, montcalm, slipped, away, and, led, the, successful, attack, on, oswego, in, august, in, the, aftermath, montcalm, and, the, indians, under, his, command, disagreed, about, the, disposition, of, prisoners, personal, effects, the, europeans, did, not, consider, them, prizes, and, prevented, the, indians, from, stripping, the, prisoners, of, their, valuables, which, angered, the, indians, loudoun, was, a, capable, administrator, but, a, cautious, field, commander, and, he, planned, one, major, operation, for, 1757, an, attack, on, new, france, s, capital, of, quebec, he, left, a, sizable, force, at, fort, william, henry, to, distract, montcalm, and, began, organizing, for, the, expedition, to, quebec, he, was, then, ordered, to, attack, louisbourg, first, by, william, pitt, the, secretary, of, state, responsible, for, the, colonies, the, expedition, was, beset, by, delays, of, all, kinds, but, was, finally, ready, to, sail, from, halifax, nova, scotia, in, early, august, in, the, meantime, french, ships, had, escaped, the, british, blockade, of, the, french, coast, and, a, fleet, awaited, loudoun, at, louisbourg, which, outnumbered, the, british, fleet, faced, with, this, strength, loudoun, returned, to, new, york, amid, news, that, a, massacre, had, occurred, at, fort, william, henry, french, irregular, forces, canadian, scouts, and, indians, harassed, fort, william, henry, throughout, the, first, half, of, 1757, in, january, they, ambushed, british, rangers, near, ticonderoga, in, february, they, launched, a, raid, against, the, position, across, the, frozen, lake, george, destroying, storehouses, and, buildings, outside, the, main, fortification, in, early, august, montcalm, and, 7, 000, troops, besieged, the, fort, which, capitulated, with, an, agreement, to, withdraw, under, parole, when, the, withdrawal, began, some, of, montcalm, s, indian, allies, attacked, the, british, column, because, they, were, angry, about, the, lost, opportunity, for, loot, killing, and, capturing, several, hundred, men, women, children, and, slaves, the, aftermath, of, the, siege, may, have, contributed, to, the, transmission, of, smallpox, into, remote, indian, populations, as, some, indians, were, reported, to, have, traveled, from, beyond, the, mississippi, to, participate, in, the, campaign, and, returned, afterward, modern, writer, william, nester, believes, that, the, indians, might, have, been, exposed, to, european, carriers, although, no, proof, exists, vaudreuil, and, montcalm, were, minimally, resupplied, in, 1758, as, the, british, blockade, of, the, french, coastline, limited, french, shipping, the, situation, in, new, france, was, further, exacerbated, by, a, poor, harvest, in, 1757, a, difficult, winter, and, the, allegedly, corrupt, machinations, of, fran, ois, bigot, the, intendant, of, the, territory, his, schemes, to, supply, the, colony, inflated, prices, and, were, believed, by, montcalm, to, line, his, pockets, and, those, of, his, associates, a, massive, outbreak, of, smallpox, among, western, indian, tribes, led, many, of, them, to, stay, away, from, trading, in, 1758, the, disease, probably, spread, through, the, crowded, conditions, at, william, henry, after, the, battle, yet, the, indians, blamed, the, french, for, bringing, bad, medicine, as, well, as, denying, them, prizes, at, fort, william, henry, montcalm, focused, his, meager, resources, on, the, defense, of, the, st, lawrence, with, primary, defenses, at, carillon, quebec, and, louisbourg, while, vaudreuil, argued, unsuccessfully, for, a, continuation, of, the, raiding, tactics, that, had, worked, quite, effectively, in, previous, years, the, british, failures, in, north, america, combined, with, other, failures, in, the, european, theater, and, led, to, newcastle, s, fall, from, power, along, with, the, duke, of, cumberland, his, principal, military, advisor, newcastle, and, pitt, joined, in, an, uneasy, coalition, in, which, pitt, dominated, the, military, planning, he, embarked, on, a, plan, for, the, 1758, campaign, that, was, largely, developed, by, loudoun, he, had, been, replaced, by, abercrombie, as, commander, in, chief, after, the, failures, of, 1757, pitt, s, plan, called, for, three, major, offensive, actions, involving, large, numbers, of, regular, troops, supported, by, the, provincial, militias, aimed, at, capturing, the, heartlands, of, new, france, two, of, the, expeditions, were, successful, with, fort, duquesne, and, louisbourg, falling, to, sizable, british, forces, the, forbes, expedition, was, a, british, campaign, in, september, october, 1758, with, 6, 000, troops, led, by, general, john, forbes, sent, to, drive, out, the, french, from, the, contested, ohio, country, the, french, withdrew, from, fort, duquesne, and, left, the, british, in, control, of, the, ohio, river, valley, the, great, french, fortress, at, louisbourg, in, nova, scotia, was, captured, after, a, siege, the, third, invasion, was, stopped, with, the, improbable, french, victory, in, the, battle, of, carillon, in, which, 3, 600, frenchmen, defeated, abercrombie, s, force, of, 18, 000, regulars, militia, and, indian, allies, outside, the, fort, which, the, french, called, carillon, and, the, british, called, ticonderoga, abercrombie, saved, something, from, the, disaster, when, he, sent, john, bradstreet, on, an, expedition, that, successfully, destroyed, fort, frontenac, including, caches, of, supplies, destined, for, new, france, s, western, forts, and, furs, destined, for, europe, abercrombie, was, recalled, and, replaced, by, jeffery, amherst, victor, at, louisbourg, the, french, had, generally, poor, results, in, 1758, in, most, theaters, of, the, war, the, new, foreign, minister, was, the, duc, de, choiseul, and, he, decided, to, focus, on, an, invasion, of, britain, to, draw, british, resources, away, from, north, america, and, the, european, mainland, the, invasion, failed, both, militarily, and, politically, as, pitt, again, planned, significant, campaigns, against, new, france, and, sent, funds, to, britain, s, mainland, ally, of, prussia, while, the, french, navy, failed, in, the, 1759, naval, battles, at, lagos, and, quiberon, bay, in, one, piece, of, good, fortune, some, french, supply, ships, did, manage, to, depart, france, and, elude, the, british, blockade, of, the, french, coast, the, british, proceeded, to, wage, a, campaign, in, the, northwest, frontier, of, canada, in, an, effort, to, cut, off, the, french, frontier, forts, to, the, west, and, south, they, captured, ticonderoga, and, fort, niagara, and, they, defeated, the, french, at, the, thousand, islands, in, the, summer, of, 1759, in, september, 1759, james, wolfe, defeated, montcalm, in, the, battle, of, the, plains, of, abraham, which, claimed, the, lives, of, both, commanders, after, the, battle, the, french, capitulated, the, city, to, the, british, in, april, 1760, fran, ois, gaston, de, l, vis, led, french, forces, to, launch, an, attack, to, retake, quebec, although, he, won, the, battle, of, sainte, foy, l, vis, subsequent, siege, of, quebec, ended, in, defeat, when, british, ships, arrived, to, relieve, the, garrison, after, l, vis, had, retreated, he, was, given, another, blow, when, a, british, naval, victory, at, restigouche, brought, the, loss, of, french, ships, meant, to, resupply, his, army, in, july, jeffrey, amherst, then, led, british, forces, numbering, around, 18, 000, men, in, a, three, pronged, attack, on, montreal, after, eliminating, french, positions, along, the, way, all, three, forces, met, up, and, surrounded, montreal, in, september, many, canadians, deserted, or, surrendered, their, arms, to, british, forces, while, the, native, allies, of, the, french, sought, peace, and, neutrality, de, l, vis, and, the, marquis, de, vaudreuil, reluctantly, signed, the, articles, of, capitulation, of, montreal, on, september, 8, which, effectively, completed, the, british, conquest, of, new, france, most, of, the, fighting, ended, in, america, in, 1760, although, it, continued, in, europe, between, france, and, britain, the, notable, exception, was, the, french, seizure, of, st, john, s, newfoundland, general, amherst, heard, of, this, surprise, action, and, immediately, dispatched, troops, under, his, nephew, william, amherst, who, regained, control, of, newfoundland, after, the, battle, of, signal, hill, in, september, 1762, many, of, the, british, troops, who, were, stationed, in, america, were, reassigned, to, participate, in, further, british, actions, in, the, west, indies, including, the, capture, of, spanish, havana, when, spain, belatedly, entered, the, conflict, on, the, side, of, france, and, a, british, expedition, against, french, martinique, in, 1762, led, by, major, general, robert, monckton, governor, vaudreuil, in, montreal, negotiated, a, capitulation, with, general, amherst, in, september, 1760, amherst, granted, his, requests, that, any, french, residents, who, chose, to, remain, in, the, colony, would, be, given, freedom, to, continue, worshiping, in, their, roman, catholic, tradition, to, own, property, and, to, remain, undisturbed, in, their, homes, the, british, provided, medical, treatment, for, the, sick, and, wounded, french, soldiers, and, french, regular, troops, were, returned, to, france, aboard, british, ships, with, an, agreement, that, they, were, not, to, serve, again, in, the, present, war, general, amherst, also, oversaw, the, transfer, of, french, fortifications, to, british, control, on, the, western, frontier, the, policies, which, he, introduced, in, those, lands, disturbed, large, numbers, of, natives, and, contributed, to, the, outbreak, of, pontiac, s, war, in, 1763, in, which, a, series, of, native, attacks, on, frontier, forts, occurred, such, as, that, on, fort, miami, which, effectively, brought, a, nearly, half, century, long, period, of, european, garrisoning, at, kekionga, to, an, end, the, frontier, settlements, required, the, continued, deployment, of, british, forces, and, the, conflict, was, not, fully, concluded, until, 1766, beginning, from, the, 1750s, and, lasting, until, the, 1760s, a, smallpox, outbreak, devastated, several, native, communities, throughout, the, american, midwest, the, outbreak, was, brought, on, in, part, by, victorious, native, warriors, who, had, fought, on, the, side, of, the, french, bringing, home, prizes, of, war, which, had, been, infected, with, the, disease, the, ojibwe, odawa, and, potawatomi, peoples, were, most, affected, by, the, outbreak, an, oral, account, from, odawa, tribal, leader, and, historian, andrew, blackbird, claimed, that, the, outbreak, had, entirely, depopulated, and, laid, waste, to, waganagisi, a, large, odawa, settlement, the, war, in, north, america, along, with, the, global, seven, years, war, officially, ended, with, the, signing, of, the, treaty, of, paris, on, 10, february, 1763, by, the, kingdoms, of, great, britain, france, and, spain, with, portugal, in, agreement, the, british, offered, france, the, choice, of, surrendering, either, its, continental, north, american, possessions, east, of, the, mississippi, or, the, caribbean, islands, of, guadeloupe, and, martinique, which, had, been, occupied, by, the, british, france, chose, to, cede, the, former, but, was, able, to, negotiate, the, retention, of, saint, pierre, and, miquelon, two, small, islands, in, the, gulf, of, st, lawrence, along, with, fishing, rights, in, the, area, they, viewed, the, economic, value, of, the, caribbean, islands, sugar, cane, to, be, greater, and, easier, to, defend, than, the, furs, from, the, continent, french, philosopher, voltaire, referred, to, canada, disparagingly, as, nothing, more, than, a, few, acres, of, snow, the, british, however, were, happy, to, take, new, france, as, defence, of, their, north, american, colonies, would, no, longer, be, an, issue, though, the, absence, of, that, threat, caused, many, colonists, to, conclude, they, no, longer, needed, british, protection, britain, also, had, ample, places, from, which, to, obtain, sugar, spain, traded, florida, to, britain, in, order, to, regain, cuba, but, they, also, gained, louisiana, from, france, including, new, orleans, in, compensation, for, their, losses, great, britain, and, spain, also, agreed, that, navigation, on, the, mississippi, river, was, to, be, open, to, vessels, of, all, nations, the, war, changed, economic, political, governmental, and, social, relations, among, the, three, european, powers, their, colonies, and, the, people, who, inhabited, those, territories, france, and, britain, both, suffered, financially, because, of, the, war, with, significant, long, term, consequences, britain, gained, control, of, french, canada, and, acadia, colonies, containing, approximately, 80, 000, primarily, french, speaking, roman, catholic, residents, the, deportation, of, acadians, beginning, in, 1755, made, land, available, to, immigrants, from, europe, and, migrants, from, the, colonies, to, the, south, the, british, resettled, many, acadians, throughout, its, american, provinces, but, many, went, to, france, and, some, went, to, new, orleans, which, they, expected, to, remain, french, some, were, sent, to, colonize, places, as, diverse, as, french, guiana, and, the, falkland, islands, but, these, efforts, were, unsuccessful, the, louisiana, population, contributed, to, founding, the, cajun, population, the, french, word, acadien, changed, to, cadien, then, to, cajun, king, george, iii, issued, the, royal, proclamation, of, 1763, on, october, 7, 1763, which, outlined, the, division, and, administration, of, the, newly, conquered, territory, and, it, continues, to, govern, relations, to, some, extent, between, the, government, of, canada, and, the, first, nations, included, in, its, provisions, was, the, reservation, of, lands, west, of, the, appalachian, mountains, to, its, indian, population, a, demarcation, that, was, only, a, temporary, impediment, to, a, rising, tide, of, westward, bound, settlers, the, proclamation, also, contained, provisions, that, prevented, civic, participation, by, the, roman, catholic, canadians, the, quebec, act, of, 1774, addressed, issues, brought, forth, by, roman, catholic, french, canadians, from, the, 1763, proclamation, and, it, transferred, the, indian, reserve, into, the, province, of, quebec, the, act, maintained, french, civil, law, including, the, seigneurial, system, a, medieval, code, removed, from, france, within, a, generation, by, the, french, revolution, the, quebec, act, was, a, major, concern, for, the, largely, protestant, thirteen, colonies, over, the, advance, of, popery, it, is, typically, associated, with, other, intolerable, acts, legislation, that, eventually, led, to, the, american, revolutionary, war, the, quebec, act, served, as, the, constitutional, document, for, the, province, of, quebec, until, it, was, superseded, by, the, constitutional, act, 1791, the, seven, years, war, nearly, doubled, great, britain, s, national, debt, the, crown, sought, sources, of, revenue, to, pay, it, off, and, attempted, to, impose, new, taxes, on, its, colonies, these, attempts, were, met, with, increasingly, stiff, resistance, until, troops, were, called, in, to, enforce, the, crown, s, authority, and, they, ultimately, led, to, the, start, of, the, american, revolutionary, war, france, attached, comparatively, little, value, to, its, american, possessions, apart, from, the, highly, profitable, sugar, producing, antilles, islands, which, it, retained, minister, choiseul, considered, that, he, had, made, a, good, deal, at, the, treaty, of, paris, and,
