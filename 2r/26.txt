place, taboos, the, rules, regarding, these, taboos, were, used, to, educate, and, govern, nri, s, subjects, this, meant, that, while, certain, igbo, may, have, lived, under, different, formal, administrations, all, followers, of, the, igbo, religion, had, to, abide, by, the, rules, of, the, faith, and, obey, its, representative, on, earth, the, eze, nri, with, the, decline, of, nri, kingdom, in, the, 15th, to, 17th, centuries, several, states, once, under, their, influence, became, powerful, economic, oracular, oligarchies, and, large, commercial, states, that, dominated, igboland, the, neighboring, awka, city, state, rose, in, power, as, a, result, of, their, powerful, agbala, oracle, and, metalworking, expertise, the, onitsha, kingdom, which, was, originally, inhabited, by, igbos, from, east, of, the, niger, was, founded, in, the, 16th, century, by, migrants, from, anioma, western, igboland, later, groups, like, the, igala, traders, from, the, hinterland, settled, in, onitsha, in, the, 18th, century, kingdoms, west, of, the, river, niger, like, aboh, abo, which, was, significantly, populated, by, igbos, among, other, tribes, dominated, trade, along, the, lower, river, niger, area, from, the, 17th, century, until, european, explorations, into, the, niger, delta, the, umunoha, state, in, the, owerri, area, used, the, igwe, ka, ala, oracle, at, their, advantage, however, the, cross, river, igbo, state, like, the, aro, had, the, greatest, influence, in, igboland, and, adjacent, areas, after, the, decline, of, nri, the, arochukwu, kingdom, emerged, after, the, aro, ibibio, wars, from, 1630, to, 1720, and, went, on, to, form, the, aro, confederacy, which, economically, dominated, eastern, nigerian, hinterland, the, source, of, the, aro, confederacy, s, economic, dominance, was, based, on, the, judicial, oracle, of, ibini, ukpabi, long, juju, and, their, military, forces, which, included, powerful, allies, such, as, ohafia, abam, ezza, and, other, related, neighboring, states, the, abiriba, and, aro, are, brothers, whose, migration, is, traced, to, the, ekpa, kingdom, east, of, cross, river, their, exact, take, of, location, was, at, ekpa, mkpa, east, of, the, cross, river, they, crossed, the, river, to, urupkam, usukpam, west, of, the, cross, river, and, founded, two, settlements, ena, uda, and, ena, ofia, in, present, day, erai, aro, and, abiriba, cooperated, to, become, a, powerful, economic, force, the, igbo, igala, wars, were, a, series, of, conflicts, between, the, igbo, people, and, the, igala, people, in, pre, colonial, nigeria, the, wars, occurred, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, and, were, primarily, driven, by, territorial, disputes, competition, for, resources, and, political, power, struggles, between, the, two, ethnic, groups, the, igbo, and, igala, engaged, in, military, confrontations, with, both, sides, vying, for, control, over, strategic, territories, these, wars, were, part, of, the, complex, dynamics, and, inter, ethnic, relations, that, characterized, the, region, during, that, historical, period, the, outcomes, of, specific, battles, and, the, overall, impact, of, the, igbo, igala, wars, varied, and, the, conflicts, eventually, contributed, to, shaping, the, socio, political, landscape, of, the, region, igbo, gods, were, numerous, but, their, relationship, to, one, another, and, human, beings, was, essentially, egalitarian, reflecting, igbo, society, as, a, whole, a, number, of, oracles, and, local, cults, attracted, devotees, while, the, central, deity, the, earth, mother, and, fertility, figure, ala, was, venerated, at, shrines, throughout, igboland, the, kingdom, of, benin, had, influence, on, the, western, igbo, who, adopted, many, of, the, political, structures, familiar, to, the, yoruba, benin, region, but, asaba, and, its, immediate, neighbours, such, as, ibusa, ogwashi, ukwu, okpanam, issele, azagba, and, issele, ukwu, were, much, closer, to, the, kingdom, of, nri, ofega, was, the, queen, for, the, onitsha, igbo, the, modern, city, of, calabar, was, founded, in, 1786, by, efik, families, who, had, left, creek, town, farther, up, the, calabar, river, settling, on, the, east, bank, in, a, position, where, they, were, able, to, dominate, traffic, with, european, vessels, that, anchored, in, the, river, and, soon, becoming, the, most, powerful, in, the, region, extending, from, now, calabar, down, to, bakassi, in, the, east, and, oron, nation, in, the, west, akwa, akpa, named, calabar, by, the, spanish, became, a, center, of, the, atlantic, slave, trade, where, african, slaves, were, sold, in, exchange, for, european, manufactured, goods, igbo, people, formed, the, majority, of, enslaved, africans, sold, as, slaves, from, calabar, despite, forming, a, minority, among, the, ethnic, groups, in, the, region, from, 1725, until, 1750, roughly, 17, 000, enslaved, africans, were, sold, from, calabar, to, european, slave, traders, from, 1772, to, 1775, the, number, soared, to, over, 62, 000, with, the, suppression, of, the, slave, trade, palm, oil, and, palm, kernels, became, the, main, exports, the, chiefs, of, akwa, akpa, placed, themselves, under, british, protection, in, 1884, from, 1884, until, 1906, old, calabar, was, the, headquarters, of, the, niger, coast, protectorate, after, which, lagos, became, the, main, center, now, called, calabar, the, city, remained, an, important, port, shipping, ivory, timber, beeswax, and, palm, produce, until, 1916, when, the, railway, terminus, was, opened, at, port, harcourt, 145, km, to, the, west, the, first, encounters, between, the, inhabitants, of, the, coast, and, europeans, the, portuguese, took, place, around, 1472, the, portuguese, began, to, trade, extensively, particularly, with, the, kingdom, of, benin, the, portuguese, traded, european, products, especially, weapons, for, ivory, and, palm, oil, and, increasingly, for, slaves, the, manillas, that, the, portuguese, used, to, pay, their, nigerian, suppliers, were, melted, down, again, in, the, kingdom, of, benin, to, create, the, bronze, artworks, that, adorned, the, royal, palace, as, a, sign, of, affluence, in, 1553, the, first, english, expedition, arrived, in, benin, from, then, on, european, merchant, ships, regularly, anchored, on, the, west, african, coast, albeit, at, a, safe, distance, from, the, mainland, due, to, the, mosquitoes, in, the, lagoons, and, the, tropical, diseases, they, spread, locals, came, to, these, ships, on, barques, and, conducted, their, business, the, europeans, named, the, coasts, of, west, africa, after, the, products, that, were, of, interest, to, them, there, the, ivory, coast, still, exists, today, the, western, coast, of, nigeria, became, the, slave, coast, in, contrast, to, the, gold, coast, further, west, today, s, ghana, the, europeans, did, not, establish, any, fortified, bases, here, until, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, the, harbour, of, calabar, on, the, historic, bay, of, biafra, became, one, of, the, largest, slave, trading, centres, in, west, africa, other, important, slave, harbours, in, nigeria, were, located, in, badagry, lagos, in, the, bay, of, benin, and, bonny, island, most, of, the, enslaved, people, brought, to, these, harbours, were, captured, in, raids, and, wars, the, most, prolific, slave, trading, kingdoms, were, the, edo, empire, of, benin, in, the, south, the, oyo, empire, in, the, south, west, and, the, aro, confederacy, in, the, south, east, in, the, north, the, incessant, fighting, between, the, hausa, city, states, and, the, decline, of, the, bornu, empire, led, to, the, fulani, gaining, a, foothold, in, the, region, originally, the, fulani, mainly, travelled, with, cattle, through, the, semi, desert, region, of, sahel, in, northern, sudan, avoiding, trade, and, mixing, with, the, sudanese, peoples, at, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, usman, dan, fodio, led, a, successful, jihad, against, the, hausa, kingdoms, and, founded, the, centralised, caliphate, of, sokoto, the, empire, with, arabic, as, its, official, language, grew, rapidly, under, his, rule, and, that, of, his, descendants, who, sent, invading, armies, in, all, directions, the, vast, landlocked, empire, linked, the, east, with, western, sudan, and, penetrated, the, south, conquering, parts, of, the, oyo, kingdom, and, advancing, into, the, yoruba, heartland, of, ibadan, the, territory, controlled, by, the, empire, included, much, of, what, is, now, northern, and, central, nigeria, the, sultan, sent, emirs, to, establish, suzerainty, over, the, conquered, territories, and, to, promote, islamic, civilisation, the, emirs, in, turn, grew, richer, and, more, powerful, through, trade, and, slavery, by, the, 1890s, the, largest, slave, population, in, the, world, about, two, million, was, concentrated, in, the, sokoto, caliphate, slaves, were, used, on, a, large, scale, especially, in, agriculture, when, the, sokoto, caliphate, disintegrated, into, various, european, colonies, in, 1903, it, was, one, of, the, largest, pre, colonial, african, states, around, 1829, hugh, clapperton, s, expedition, to, europe, made, it, known, that, and, where, the, niger, flows, into, the, atlantic, he, himself, did, not, survive, the, journey, but, died, of, malaria, and, dysentery, his, documents, were, published, by, his, servant, richard, lander, after, this, there, were, numerous, privately, funded, forays, into, the, interior, such, as, the, niger, expedition, of, 1841, in, which, a, large, number, of, the, european, participants, quickly, died, of, tropical, diseases, and, which, is, reported, in, the, diary, of, fellow, traveller, samuel, ajayi, crowther, mentioned, again, in, the, next, chapter, around, 1850, the, explorer, heinrich, barth, travelled, through, northern, nigeria, as, part, of, a, british, expedition, through, his, travels, barth, acquired, special, merits, in, the, unprejudiced, and, respectful, study, of, peoples, and, languages, he, himself, had, the, ability, to, learn, african, languages, very, quickly, he, spoke, and, wrote, arabic, fluently, as, well, as, in, african, history, barth, also, developed, the, hypothesis, of, a, primeval, wet, phase, in, northern, africa, around, 1750, british, merchant, ships, shipped, european, goods, to, africa, from, there, slaves, to, american, plantations, and, products, from, there, such, as, tobacco, to, europe, however, from, 1787, and, increasingly, from, 1791, following, reports, of, a, slave, revolt, in, saint, domingue, the, british, parliament, debated, the, abolition, of, the, slave, trade, with, the, prohibition, of, the, slave, trade, not, slavery, by, britain, in, 1807, british, interest, in, nigeria, shifted, to, palm, oil, for, use, in, soaps, and, as, a, lubricant, for, machinery, however, abolition, in, britain, was, one, sided, and, many, other, countries, took, its, place, european, companies, and, smugglers, continued, to, operate, the, atlantic, slave, trade, the, british, west, africa, squadron, attempted, to, intercept, the, smugglers, at, sea, the, rescued, slaves, were, taken, to, freetown, a, colony, in, west, africa, originally, founded, by, lieutenant, john, clarkson, for, the, resettlement, of, slaves, freed, by, britain, after, the, american, revolutionary, war, in, north, america, britain, s, west, africa, squadron, was, tenacious, in, concluding, anti, slavery, treaties, with, coastal, chiefdoms, along, the, west, african, coast, from, sierra, leone, through, the, niger, delta, to, the, south, of, the, congo, however, the, nigerian, coast, proved, difficult, to, control, with, its, countless, bays, meandering, channels, and, rampant, tropical, diseases, badagry, lagos, bonny, and, calabar, therefore, remained, lively, centres, of, the, slave, trade, the, fight, against, the, slave, trade, by, the, british, plunged, the, kingdom, of, oyo, into, a, crisis, that, ultimately, led, to, civil, war, within, the, yoruba, region, it, became, a, constant, source, of, prisoners, of, war, for, the, slave, markets, in, 1841, oba, akitoye, ascended, the, throne, of, lagos, and, tried, to, put, an, end, to, the, slave, trade, some, lagos, merchants, resisted, the, ban, deposed, the, king, and, replaced, him, with, his, brother, kosoko, britain, intervened, in, this, power, struggle, within, the, lagos, royalty, by, bombarding, lagos, with, the, royal, navy, in, 1851, the, british, thus, replaced, kosoko, with, akitoye, again, in, 1852, akitoye, and, the, british, consul, john, beecroft, signed, a, treaty, to, free, the, slaves, and, grant, the, british, permanent, trade, access, to, lagos, however, akitoye, had, difficulties, implementing, these, resolutions, the, situation, therefore, remained, unsatisfactory, for, britain, the, royal, navy, originally, used, the, harbour, of, the, island, of, fernando, po, now, bioko, equatorial, guinea, off, nigeria, as, a, base, of, operations, in, 1855, spain, claimed, this, harbour, for, itself, the, royal, navy, therefore, had, to, look, for, another, naval, base, and, chose, the, island, of, lagos, which, at, 9, km, 2, was, roughly, the, same, size, as, the, orkney, island, of, papa, westray, resp, five, times, the, size, of, coney, island, or, one, seventh, of, lower, manhattan, and, flooded, several, times, per, year, for, this, purpose, king, akitoye, had, died, in, the, meantime, his, brother, kosoko, then, threatened, to, take, back, control, of, lagos, with, the, help, of, french, colonial, troops, the, american, civil, war, which, centred, on, the, issue, of, slavery, made, the, power, struggle, for, lagos, particularly, urgent, as, a, result, lord, palmerston, british, prime, minister, made, the, decision, that, it, was, expedient, losing, no, time, in, assuming, the, formal, protectorate, of, lagos, william, mccoskry, the, acting, consul, in, lagos, together, with, commander, bedingfield, convened, a, meeting, with, king, dosunmu, akitoye, s, successor, on, board, hms, prometheus, on, 30, july, 1861, at, which, the, british, intentions, were, explained, dosunmu, resisted, the, terms, of, the, treaty, but, under, the, threat, of, having, commander, bedingfield, bombard, lagos, he, relented, and, signed, the, lagos, cession, treaty, lagos, proved, to, be, strategically, useful, and, became, a, major, trading, centre, as, traders, could, count, on, the, protection, of, the, royal, navy, to, protect, them, from, pirates, for, example, british, missionaries, penetrated, further, inland, brazilian, freedmen, settled, in, lagos, the, british, government, introduced, english, laws, in, lagos, in, 1862, there, was, the, court, of, civil, and, criminal, justice, and, the, west, african, court, of, appeal, a, supreme, court, was, established, in, 1876, english, common, law, equity, law, and, british, law, applied, after, its, experiences, in, the, american, war, of, independence, great, britain, had, limited, itself, to, maintaining, strategically, placed, bases, around, the, world, such, as, lagos, and, avoided, colonising, regions, far, from, the, coast, this, changed, in, the, 1860s, when, european, powers, embarked, on, the, scramble, for, africa, up, until, this, point, european, trade, with, the, natives, was, conducted, by, ships, that, anchored, off, the, coast, and, travelled, on, once, the, business, was, concluded, as, tropical, lagoons, unlike, the, open, sea, offer, favourable, conditions, for, mosquitoes, which, pass, on, tropical, diseases, europeans, avoided, going, ashore, because, of, the, sleeping, sickness, west, africa, was, nicknamed, the, white, man, s, grave, until, around, 1850, the, industrial, production, of, quinine, from, the, 1820s, and, its, use, as, a, prophylactic, against, malaria, on, a, large, scale, changed, the, situation, the, european, naval, powers, were, now, able, to, establish, permanent, settlements, in, the, tropics, british, missionaries, penetrated, the, interior, of, the, country, in, south, eastern, nigeria, hope, wadell, and, mary, slessor, fought, against, the, customary, killing, of, newborn, twins, against, the, trial, by, ordeal, in, legal, disputes, and, against, the, killing, of, the, servants, of, deceased, village, elders, in, order, to, be, able, to, serve, them, in, the, afterlife, from, 1845, onwards, missionaries, founded, schools, and, enabled, the, careers, of, eyo, ita, the, first, dark, skinned, professor, and, nnamdi, azikiwe, the, first, nigerian, president, for, example, in, 1864, samuel, ajayi, crowther, became, the, first, african, bishop, of, the, anglican, church, the, first, years, of, european, colonialism, in, africa, were, characterised, by, the, austrian, school, of, economics, and, the, marginal, utility, theory, it, advocated, according, to, which, the, value, of, products, manufactured, in, europe, was, higher, in, markets, that, were, not, yet, saturated, such, as, africa, marginal, utility, and, trade, with, colonies, was, therefore, more, profitable, than, in, one, s, own, country, for, example, the, lower, demand, or, purchasing, power, in, the, unsaturated, market, was, not, taken, into, account, with, the, prospect, of, such, high, profits, various, private, trading, companies, promoted, european, influence, in, west, africa, one, of, them, was, the, united, africa, company, founded, by, george, goldie, in, 1879, which, was, granted, concessions, for, the, entire, area, around, the, niger, basin, by, the, british, government, in, 1886, under, the, name, royal, niger, company, the, rnc, marked, out, its, territory, as, if, it, were, a, state, in, its, own, right, and, also, negotiated, treaties, with, the, northern, states, the, sokoto, caliphate, nupe, and, gwandu, it, was, also, authorised, to, administer, justice, in, its, territories, the, rnc, faced, competition, from, three, other, groups, two, french, trading, companies, and, another, british, group, a, price, war, ensued, in, which, the, rnc, emerged, victorious, because, in, france, the, main, proponent, of, african, colonisation, l, on, gambetta, had, died, in, 1882, and, in, 1883, considerable, subsidies, for, these, colonisation, companies, were, cancelled, by, the, mother, country, the, rnc, s, monopoly, enabled, britain, to, resist, french, and, german, demands, for, the, internationalisation, of, trade, on, the, niger, during, negotiations, at, the, berlin, conference, in, 1884, 1885, goldie, succeeded, in, having, the, region, in, which, the, rnc, operated, included, in, the, british, sphere, of, interest, british, assurances, that, free, trade, in, niger, would, be, respected, were, hollow, words, the, rnc, s, more, than, 400, contracts, with, local, leaders, obliged, the, natives, to, trade, exclusively, with, or, through, the, company, s, agents, high, tariffs, and, royalties, drove, competing, companies, out, of, the, territory, when, king, jaja, of, opobo, organised, his, own, trading, network, and, even, began, routing, his, own, palm, oil, shipments, to, britain, he, was, lured, onto, a, british, warship, and, exiled, to, st, vincent, on, charges, of, breach, of, treaty, and, obstruction, of, trade, the, rnc, which, traded, mainly, in, liquor, and, arms, along, the, niger, soon, gained, a, bad, reputation, originally, a, way, for, the, colonial, office, to, bring, the, region, under, british, control, at, little, cost, it, proved, ineffective, in, promoting, peace, and, stability, this, was, evident, in, the, case, of, the, brass, they, had, no, arable, land, of, their, own, and, traditionally, lived, from, barter, along, the, niger, with, the, advent, of, the, rcn, they, had, to, pay, license, fees, for, imports, and, exports, which, they, could, not, afford, the, brass, tried, unsuccessfully, to, find, alternative, trade, routes, and, began, to, starve, on, december, 29, 1894, they, attacked, the, rnc, headquarters, in, akassa, looting, much, of, the, company, s, property, and, destroying, the, warehouses, and, machinery, they, even, kidnapped, several, of, the, company, s, employees, whom, they, later, ritually, ate, as, part, of, a, spiritual, ceremony, which, they, hoped, would, protect, them, against, the, rampant, smallpox, epidemic, the, rnc, now, demanded, massive, protection, for, its, employees, from, the, colonial, office, which, the, latter, was, not, prepared, to, do, and, which, contradicted, the, above, mentioned, goal, of, low, expenditure, the, colonial, office, which, had, been, under, the, imperialist, leadership, of, joseph, chamberlain, since, 1895, increasingly, wondered, whether, it, would, not, be, better, to, place, the, monopolist, s, territory, under, direct, colonial, rule, the, berlin, congo, conference, of, 1885, defined, the, spheres, of, interest, of, the, european, colonial, powers, in, africa, without, regard, to, ethnic, or, cultural, conditions, and, without, the, participation, of, the, people, in, the, affected, regions, for, example, the, territory, of, the, yoruba, and, that, of, the, hausa, was, divided, by, the, demarcation, between, the, british, and, the, french, one, must, even, assume, that, this, was, intentional, after, all, this, fragmentation, naturally, made, it, easier, for, the, colonial, rulers, to, dominate, the, indigenous, people, although, this, avoided, wars, between, europeans, over, these, colonies, it, encouraged, military, advances, by, europeans, in, africa, with, devastating, consequences, for, the, natives, this, was, due, to, the, fact, that, a, colonial, power, s, demarcated, territories, were, only, valid, if, that, colonial, power, actually, brought, the, area, under, its, control, rather, than, another, power, first, the, united, kingdom, now, took, military, action, wherever, british, traders, or, missionaries, saw, their, fields, of, activity, restricted, in, 1892, the, british, conquered, the, ijebu, empire, on, the, outskirts, of, lagos, an, empire, that, had, previously, seceded, from, the, oyo, empire, and, refused, to, engage, in,

the, oyo, empire, 50, km, north, of, lagos, which, even, after, its, decline, was, still, one, of, the, most, powerful, native, states, in, present, day, nigeria, and, restricted, the, activities, of, the, missionaries, the, british, bombed, the, capital, ibadan, after, christian, missionaries, had, brought, their, parishioners, to, safety, after, the, bombardment, the, missionaries, had, a, fair, talk, with, the, elector, king, alaafin, of, ibadan, and, convinced, him, to, submit, to, british, protection, anglican, christianity, became, the, state, religion, in, oyo, the, conquered, territory,

initiate, legal, proceedings, against, the, colonial, rulers, residents, of, a, protectorate, did, not, have, these, rights, benin, was, a, slave, owning, state, 150, kilometres, east, of, lagos, and, was, one, of, the, four, largest, kingdoms, in, what, is, now, nigeria, as, early, as, 1862, there, were, reports, of, human, sacrifices, being, made, in, benin, in, times, of, need, consul, burton, described, the, kingdom, as, gratuitous, barbarity, which, stinks, of, death, in, 1892, great, britain, concluded, a, contract, with, king, oba, ov, nramw, n, of, benin, for, the, supply, of, palm, oil, the, latter, signed, reluctantly, and, shortly, afterwards, made, additional, financial, demands, in, 1896, vice, consul, phillips, travelled, to, ov, nramw, n, with, 18, officials, 180, porters, and, 60, local, workers, to, renegotiate, the, contract, he, sent, a, delegate, ahead, with, gifts, to, announce, his, visit, but, the, king, sent, word, that, he, did, not, wish, to, receive, the, visit, for, the, time, being, king, ov, nramw, n, was, aware, of, the, fate, of, king, jaja, of, opobo, see, above, which, could, explain, his, lack, of, hospitality, phillips, nevertheless, set, off, but, was, ambushed, from, which, only, two, of, his, fellow, travellers, escaped, alive, albeit, seriously, injured, in, february, 1897, a, punitive, expedition, was, set, up, under, admiral, rawson,

be, killed, with, impunity, 5, 000, british, soldiers, and, sailors, invaded, the, kingdom, of, benin, which, barely, defended, itself, but, made, the, above, mentioned, human, sacrifices, in, its, misery, the, british, forces, encountered, shocking, scenes, the, kingdom, of, benin, was, incorporated, into, the, british, dominion, the, british, burnt, down, the, royal, palace, of, benin, and, looted, the, bronze, sculptures, there, which, are, now, a, world, heritage, site, these, were, later, auctioned, off, in, europe, to, finance, the, punitive, expedition, in, 1897, captain, lugard, who, had, already, established, and, stabilised, british, colonial, rule, in, malawi, and, uganda, was, commissioned, to, set, up, an, indigenous, nigerian, force, to, protect, british, interests, in, the, hinterland, of, the, colony, of, lagos, and, nigeria, against, french, attacks, in, august, 1897, lugard, organised, the, west, african, frontier, force, and, commanded, it, until, the, end, of, december, 1899, by, september, 1898, britain, and, france, had, already, settled, their, colonial, disputes, in, the, fashoda, crisis, and, concluded, the, entente, cordiale, in, 1904, thus, depriving, the, waff, of, its, original, purpose, however, the, waff, was, to, play, a, crucial, role, in, the, liberation, of, east, africa, from, fascist, italian, rule, during, the, second, world, war, in, 1941, colonel, lugard, would, significantly, determine, nigeria, s, development, over, the, next, 22, years, the, first, railway, line, in, west, and, central, africa, between, lagos, and, abeokuta, was, opened, in, nigeria, in, 1898, however, it, was, followed, shortly, afterwards, by, the, british, colony, of, gold, coast, ghana, 1901, the, german, colonies, of, cameroon, 1901, and, togo, 1905, and, the, french, colonies, of, dahomey, 1906, and, ivory, coast, 1907, forced, labour, was, also, or, mainly, used, in, the, construction, work, the, staff, of, the, railway, company, soon, organised, themselves, and, organised, nigeria, s, first, strike, in, 1904, ten, years, after, the, scramble, for, africa, in, the, 1890s, it, became, increasingly, clear, that, colonial, rule, in, africa, was, not, a, profitable, endeavour, and, that, the, exploration, and, development, of, the, continent, which, had, originally, been, initiated, by, the, private, sector, could, only, be, continued, through, state, military, measures, and, or, taxpayers, money, the, above, mentioned, marginal, utility, theory, had, given, way, to, the, theory, of, shrinking, markets, a, term, coined, by, the, economic, theorist, werner, sombart, according, to, this, theory, colonies, were, supposedly, a, necessary, measure, for, industrialised, countries, to, maintain, sales, and, food, supplies, the, theory, was, adopted, by, both, left, wing, theorists, such, as, bukharin, and, luxemburg, exploitation, of, the, colonies, and, right, wing, thinkers, such, as, rosenberg, and, hitler, lebensraum, the, rnc, s, concession, was, revoked, in, 1899, and, on, 1, january, 1900, it, ceded, its, territories, to, the, british, government, for, the, sum, of, 865, 000, the, ceded, territory, was, merged, with, the, small, niger, coast, protectorate, which, had, been, under, british, control, since, 1884, to, form, the, southern, nigeria, protectorate, and, the, remaining, rnc, territory, of, around, 1, 3, million, square, kilometres, became, the, northern, nigeria, protectorate, 1, 000, british, soldiers, were, stationed, in, the, protectorate, of, southern, nigeria, 2, 500, in, the, protectorate, of, northern, nigeria, and, 700, in, lagos, the, rnc, was, taken, over, by, lever, brothers, in, 1920, and, became, part, of, the, unilever, group, in, 1929, in, 1939, the, latter, still, controlled, 80, per, cent, of, nigerian, exports, mainly, cocoa, palm, oil, and, rubber, due, to, the, complex, coastline, in, the, niger, delta, there, were, no, closed, dominions, in, south, east, nigeria, until, 1900, but, rather, a, conglomerate, of, city, states, that, focussed, on, trade, along, the, coast, and, inland, along, the, niger, and, benue, rivers, these, city, states, which, were, united, in, the, aro, confederacy, had, a, religious, centre, in, arochukwu, the, juju, oracle, the, form, of, decision, making, in, the, city, states, can, be, described, as, pre, democratic, in, this, region, which, later, became, sadly, known, as, biafra, feudal, rule, was, just, as, difficult, to, enforce, as, british, colonial, rule, the, later, biafra, war, of, 1966, to, 1970, was, among, other, things, a, conflict, between, the, democratic, instincts, of, the, south, eastern, igbo, population, and, the, authoritarian, structures, in, the, rest, of, nigeria, the, british, defeated, the, aro, confederacy, in, the, anglo, aro, war, 1901, 1902, and, spread, their, influence, along, the, coast, to, the, south, east, as, far, as, german, cameroon, however, control, of, the, niger, delta, remained, an, unsolved, problem, both, for, the, british, colonial, rulers, and, later, for, independent, nigeria, pirates, marauders, self, proclaimed, freedom, fighters, and, since, 1957, oil, thieves, still, find, enough, nooks, and, crannies, in, the, confusing, landscape, and, under, the, jungle, canopy, to, evade, police, action, in, 1906, the, crown, colony, of, lagos, was, incorporated, into, the, protectorate, of, southern, nigeria, in, lekki, near, lagos, the, nigerian, bitumen, corporation, under, businessman, john, simon, bergheim, discovered, crude, oil, during, test, drilling, in, 1908, however, engineers, were, unable, to, prevent, large, quantities, of, water, from, being, extracted, as, well, oil, production, could, therefore, not, be, made, profitable, without, additional, investment, bergheim, s, fatal, car, accident, in, 1912, put, an, end, to, further, exploration, of, nigeria, s, oil, reserves, for, the, time, being, in, 1909, coal, deposits, were, discovered, and, extracted, in, the, south, east, of, nigeria, in, enugu, two, years, later, this, region, the, nti, kingdom, was, placed, directly, under, british, colonial, administration, despite, the, consecration, of, samuel, ajayi, crowther, as, a, bishop, or, perhaps, because, of, it, european, and, north, american, churches, refused, to, accept, dark, skinned, clergymen, while, the, mainly, protestant, missionary, work, in, southern, nigeria, was, quite, successful, this, led, to, countless, evangelistic, and, pentecostal, free, churches, which, are, still, omnipresent, in, the, south, today, nigeria, s, first, trade, union, the, nigeria, civil, service, union, was, formed, in, 1912, but, would, not, be, recognised, until, 1938, until, which, time, its, members, were, subjected, to, harassment, in, 1900, colonel, lugard, was, appointed, high, commissioner, of, the, newly, created, protectorate, of, northern, nigeria, he, read, the, proclamation, at, mount, patti, in, lokoja, that, established, the, protectorate, on, 1, january, 1900, but, at, this, time, the, part, of, northern, nigeria, that, was, actually, under, british, control, was, still, small, in, 1893, rabih, az, zubayr, a, sudanese, warlord, conquered, the, kingdom, of, bornu, the, british, recognised, rabih, as, sultan, of, borno, until, the, french, killed, rabih, at, the, battle, of, kouss, ri, on, 22, april, 1900, the, colonial, powers, of, great, britain, france, and, germany, divided, up, his, territory, with, the, british, receiving, what, is, now, north, east, nigeria, they, formally, restituted, the, borno, empire, under, british, rule, before, the, conquest, in, 1893, and, appointed, a, scion, of, the, ruling, family, of, the, time, abubakar, garbai, as, shehu, sheikh, in, 1902, the, british, advanced, north, westwards, into, the, sokoto, caliphate, in, 1903, victory, at, the, battle, of, kano, gave, the, british, a, logistical, advantage, in, pacifying, the, heartland, of, the, sokoto, caliphate, and, parts, of, the, former, borno, empire, on, 13, march, 1903, the, last, vizier, of, the, caliphate, surrendered, by, 1906, resistance, to, british, rule, had, ended, and, there, would, be, no, more, war, within, nigeria, s, borders, for, the, next, 60, years, when, lugard, resigned, as, commissioner, in, 1906, the, entire, region, of, present, day, nigeria, was, administered, under, british, supervision, after, the, british, trauma, of, the, siege, of, khartoum, the, colonial, office, favoured, a, more, subtle, approach, in, islamic, northern, nigeria, lugard, developed, the, concept, of, indirect, rule, in, which, the, colonial, rulers, left, the, traditional, social, structures, intact, the, fact, that, the, sokoto, caliphate, of, 1804, was, a, rule, of, the, fulani, over, the, more, numerous, hausa, worked, in, his, favour, by, replacing, the, fulani, with, the, british, the, new, british, rule, in, northern, nigeria, could, be, implemented, with, minimal, social, upheaval, the, sokoto, caliphate, was, formally, allowed, to, continue, and, a, new, caliph, attahiru, ii, was, appointed, in, 1903, however, the, sultan, of, the, caliphate, was, now, the, governor, of, northern, nigeria, namely, lugard, like, his, fulani, predecessors, he, had, the, right, to, enact, laws, and, appoint, officials, murray, last, therefore, refers, to, the, protectorate, of, northern, nigeria, as, the, colonial, caliphate, the, local, regents, remained, the, emirs, several, hundred, in, a, three, tier, hierarchy, the, emirs, were, appointed, by, so, called, kingmakers, whereby, the, sultan, british, governor, had, the, right, of, nomination, the, british, governor, could, depose, emirs, and, lugard, did, this, ten, times, in, 1906, alone, even, in, the, fourth, republic, of, nigeria, emirs, are, occasionally, deposed, by, state, governors, the, emirs, carried, out, british, instructions, such, as, drafting, recruits, during, the, world, wars, and, presided, over, a, court, that, spoke, islamic, maliki, law, but, following, the, opinion, of, the, orientalist, joseph, schacht, took, british, law, into, supplementary, consideration, within, an, emirate, the, emir, was, therefore, the, employer, of, the, judges, alkali, qadi, he, appointed, each, emir, was, officially, advised, by, a, british, resident, but, was, actually, controlled, the, british, prevented, torture, as, a, method, of, interrogation, the, cutting, off, of, body, parts, for, theft, and, stoning, to, death, for, adultery, for, example, as, the, maliki, school, of, islamic, law, makes, no, distinction, between, for, example, murder, and, involuntary, manslaughter, or, the, criminal, offence, of, vandalism, and, civil, damage, to, property, the, british, introduced, the, principle, of, malice, intent, death, sentences, had, to, be, authorised, by, the, resident, and, children, of, slaves, were, now, considered, freeborn, the, emirs, also, collected, taxes, taxes, such, as, the, land, tax, kharaj, and, the, poll, tax, jizyah, no, longer, went, to, the, emirs, instead, each, emir, could, retain, 25, per, cent, of, the, taxes, he, collected, for, his, administration, the, emirs, thus, had, a, financial, and, disciplinary, motivation, to, be, loyal, to, the, british, over, the, next, few, decades, islamic, law, in, northern, nigeria, was, continually, restricted, and, by, the, 1940s, only, applied, to, family, and, inheritance, law, in, 1912, after, an, interlude, in, hong, kong, lugard, returned, as, governor, of, the, two, nigerian, protectorates, he, merged, the, two, colonies, into, one, in, the, same, year, lugard, who, found, the, inhabitants, of, lagos, rebellious, had, a, new, seaport, built, in, the, south, east, as, a, rival, to, lagos, and, named, it, port, harcourt, after, his, superior, in, the, colonial, office, this, seaport, soon, received, a, railway, line, to, enugu, and, shipped, the, coal, mined, there, from, 1958, also, crude, oil, overseas, lugard, became, the, first, governor, of, all, nigeria, the, unification, of, nigeria, helped, to, give, nigeria, common, telegraphs, railways, customs, and, excise, duties, uniform, time, a, common, currency, and, a, common, civil, service, lugard, thus, introduced, what, was, needed, for, the, infrastructure, of, a, modern, state, however, the, north, and, south, remained, as, two, separate, countries, with, separate, administrations, in, the, south, english, was, the, official, language, and, was, taught, in, schools, in, the, north, hausa, southern, nigerians, thus, had, access, to, english, language, literature, from, scientific, literature, to, novels, their, compatriots, in, the, north, had, to, make, do, with, the, much, less, comprehensive, hausa, literature, which, mainly, dealt, with, philosophical, and, practical, questions, about, islam, this, imbalance, can, still, be, found, today, in, 2024, for, example, there, are, 6, 8, million, articles, in, english, and, 101, articles, in, hausa, on, wikipedia, southern, nigerians, also, began, to, engage, in, literary, endeavours, since, 1950, there, has, been, an, independent, and, dynamic, nigerian, literary, scene, in, which, the, german, jewish, professor, at, the, university, of, ibadan, ulli, beier, played, a, major, role, the, protectorate, in, the, south, financed, itself, with, 1, 933, 235, in, tax, revenue, 1912, the, larger, but, underdeveloped, northern, protectorate, collected, 274, 989, in, the, same, year, and, had, to, be, subsidised, by, the, british, to, the, tune, of, 250, 000, annually, this, economic, structure, basically, exists, to, this, day, regional, differences, in, access, to, modern, education, soon, became, pronounced, some, children, of, the, southern, elite, went, to, britain, for, higher, education, the, imbalance, between, north, and, south, was, also, reflected, in, nigeria, s, political, life, for, example, slavery, was, not, banned, in, northern, nigeria, until, 1936, while, it, was, abolished, in, other, parts, of, nigeria, around, 1885, northern, nigeria, still, had, between, 1, million, and, 2, 5, million, slaves, around, 1900, the, attempt, to, enforce, this, system, in, the, south, also, met, with, varying, degrees, of, success, in, the, yoruba, region, of, the, south, west, the, british, were, able, to, tie, in, with, existing, or, formerly, existing, kingdoms, and, their, borders, however, as, there, were, no, hierarchical, or, even, feudal, structures, in, the, south, east, through, which, the, british, could, indirectly, rule, they, appointed, warrant, chiefs, with, powers, to, act, as, local, representatives, of, the, british, administration, among, their, people, however, the, british, did, not, realise, that, in, some, parts, of, africa, the, concept, of, chiefs, or, kings, was, not, known, among, the, igbo, for, example, decisions, were, made, through, lengthy, debates, and, general, consensus, the, new, powers, vested, in, the, warrant, chiefs, and, reinforced, by, the, native, court, system, led, to, an, exercise, of, power, and, authority, unprecedented, in, pre, colonial, times, the, warrant, chiefs, also, used, their, power, to, amass, wealth, at, the, expense, of, their, subjects, the, warrant, chiefs, were, corrupt, arrogant, and, accordingly, hated, governors, were, authorised, to, enact, laws, otherwise, english, law, applied, there, was, a, supreme, court, provincial, courts, and, cantonal, courts, decisions, of, the, supreme, court, could, be, appealed, to, the, west, african, court, of, appeal, the, provincial, courts, did, not, allow, legal, representation, by, lawyers, and, were, staffed, by, administrative, rather, than, judicial, personnel, from, the, outset, british, colonial, rule, utilised, and, reinforced, the, differences, between, the, ethnic, groups, present, in, order, to, offer, itself, to, each, side, as, a, power, preserving, factor, and, to, be, able, to, control, the, oversized, colony, with, relatively, little, military, expenditure, 4, 200, british, soldiers, in, the, south, education, economy, and, civilisational, achievements, dominated, while, in, the, north, the, military, feudalism, and, islamic, traditions, were, deliberately, reinforced, by, the, british, while, officer, positions, were, filled, with, british, enlisted, men, non, commissioned, officers, and, higher, non, commissioned, officer, positions, sergeant, majors, were, exclusively, filled, with, northern, nigerians, as, these, were, regarded, as, warrior, peoples, in, accordance, with, a, popular, doctrine, practised, in, india, since, 1857, e, g, sikhs, brahmins, nigeria, thus, remained, divided, in, many, respects, into, the, northern, and, southern, protectorates, and, the, colony, of, lagos, on, lugard, historian, k, b, c, onwubiko, says, his, system, of, indirect, rule, his, hostility, towards, educated, nigerians, in, the, south, and, his, system, of, education, for, the, north, which, aimed, at, training, only, the, sons, of, the, chiefs, and, emirs, as, clerks, and, interpreters, show, him, as, one, of, britain, s, arch, imperialists, in, august, 1914, a, british, nigerian, military, unit, attacked, cameroon, after, 18, months, the, german, imperial, schutztruppe, surrendered, to, a, superior, force, of, british, nigerians, belgians, and, french, some, german, units, were, able, to, escape, to, the, spanish, and, thus, neutral, rio, muni, today, s, equatorial, guinea, in, the, treaty, of, versailles, the, german, colony, of, cameroon, was, divided, up, between, the, british, and, french, as, a, league, of, nations, trust, territory, in, 1920, the, western, part, of, the, former, german, colony, of, cameroon, was, administratively, annexed, to, british, nigeria, as, a, league, of, nations, mandate, territory, under, the, name, british, cameroons, lugard, s, successor, 1919, 1925, sir, hugh, clifford, was, an, avowed, opponent, of, lugard, s, views, and, saw, his, role, not, in, the, efficient, running, of, an, apparatus, of, power, but, in, the, development, of, the, country, he, intensified, educational, efforts, in, the, south, and, repeatedly, suggested, to, the, colonial, office, in, london, that, the, power, of, the, absolutist, emirs, ruling, in, the, north, should, be, limited, which, was, rejected, this, further, deepened, the, de, facto, division, of, the, country, into, a, northern, south, western, and, south, eastern, part, in, the, north, the, indirect, rule, aimed, at, preserving, feudal, rule, continued, to, apply, in, the, south, an, educated, elite, based, on, the, european, model, emerged, in, 1922, clifford, established, the, legislative, council, the, four, elected, members, were, from, lagos, 3, and, calabar, 1, the, legislative, council, enacted, laws, for, the, colony, and, the, protectorate, of, southern, nigeria, it, also, approved, the, annual, budget, for, the, entire, country, the, four, elected, members, were, the, first, africans, to, be, elected, to, a, parliamentary, body, in, british, west, africa, the, clifford, constitution, accordingly, led, to, the, formation, of, political, parties, in, nigeria, herbert, macaulay, a, newspaper, owner, and, grandson, of, samuel, ajayi, crowther, see, above, founded, the, first, nigerian, political, party, the, nigeria, national, democratic, party, in, 1923, it, remained, the, strongest, party, in, the, elections, until, 1939, nigeria, s, and, the, commonwealth, s, contact, with, great, britain, was, mainly, maintained, by, mail, ships, of, the, elder, dempster, lines, until, the, end, of, 1967, such, a, mail, ship, sailed, from, liverpool, to, lagos, every, second, friday, alternating, between, the, ms, apapa, the, ms, accra, and, the, mv, aureol, the, journey, took, 13, days, and, went, via, las, palmas, bathurst, banjul, freetown, monrovia, and, tema, with, a, five, day, stopover, in, lagos, apapa, in, addition, to, letters, parcels, and, newspapers, the, mail, ships, also, carried, cargo, and, about, 250, 1st, class, passengers, and, 24, 3rd, class, passengers, which, was, mainly, used, by, nuns, and, salvation, army, officers, there, was, no, 2nd, class, the, 1st, class, which, consisted, of, colonial, officials, colonial, army, officers, business, travelers, and, globetrotters, had, its, own, lounge, library, bar, and, smoking, room, there, were, generous, baggage, allowances, which, nigerian, traders, were, happy, to, fully, utilize, on, the, return, journey, to, lagos, the, railway, company, paid, very, well, due, to, the, activities, of, the, well, organised, railway, workers, union, but, also, due, to, competing, employers, who, were, happy, to, poach, skilled, workers, high, school, graduates, could, train, as, train, drivers, or, technicians, engineers, in, six, year, vocational, school, courses, run, by, nigerian, railways, during, this, training, the, apprentices, were, paid, and, received, an, annual, salary, of, 380, 480, as, of, 1935, in, today, s, money, value, about, 38, 48, 000, significantly, more, than, the, average, nigerian, income, today, for, the, vocational, students, in, lagos, the, railway, company, had, specially, provided, a, discarded, but, still, functional, 0, 6, 0, steam, locomotive, worth, 4, million, in, today, s, money, value, which, they, could, use, to, learn, how, it, worked, in, the, meantime, it, had, become, clear, that, colonies, were, neither, profitable, in, the, sense, of, the, marginal, utility, theory, described, above, nor, were, they, the, solution, to, the, problem, of, shrinking, markets, instead, nigeria, continued, to, gobble, up, taxpayers, money, despite, investments, totalling, several, billions, like, most, african, colonies, and, hardly, benefited, the, economy, of, the, mother, country, the, new, governor, graeme, thomson, therefore, introduced, harsh, austerity, measures, in, 1925, including, massive, redundancies, and, the, introduction, of, direct, taxation, the, planned, tax, on, women, market, traders, graeme, thomson, s, undiplomatic, manner, and, the, unpopular, warrant, chief, system, see, above, led, to, the, women, s, war, of, 1929, among, the, igbo, the, women, farmers, destroyed, ten, native, courts, by, december, 1929, when, the, troops, restored, order, in, the, region, in, addition, the, houses, of, chiefs, and, employees, of, the, native, courts, were, attacked, european, factories, looted, prisons, attacked, and, prisoners, released, the, women, demanded, the, removal, of, the, warrant, chiefs, and, their, replacement, by, native, clan, chiefs, appointed, by, the, people, and, not, by, the, british, 55, women, were, killed, by, the, colonial, troops, nevertheless, the, women, s, war, of, 1929, led, to, fundamental, reforms, in, the, british, colonial, administration, the, british, abolished, the, system, of, warrant, chiefs, and, reviewed, the, nature, of, colonial, rule, over, the, natives, of, nigeria, several, colonial, administrators, condemned, the, prevailing, administrative, system, and, agreed, to, the, call, for, urgent, reforms, based, on, the, indigenous, system, in, place, of, the, old, warrant, chief, system, tribunals, were, introduced, that, took, into, account, the, indigenous, system, of, government, that, had, prevailed, before, colonial, rule, in, 1933, the, lagos, youth, movement, later, the, nigerian, youth, movement, was, founded, and, took, a, more, strident, stance, in, favour, of, independence, than, the, nndp, in, 1938, the, nym, called, for, nigeria, to, be, granted, british, dominion, status, putting, it, on, a, par, with, australia, or, canada, in, 1937, it, was, joined, by, nnamdi, azikiwe, who, had, been, exiled, from, ghana, gold, coast, for, seditious, activities, and, who, became, publisher, and, editor, in, chief, of, the, west, african, pilot, and, father, of, nigerian, popular, journalism, in, 1938, the, nym, protested, against, the, cocoa, cartel, which, kept, the, purchase, prices, from, farmers, artificially, low, in, 1939, the, nym, became, the, strongest, party, in, the, elections, in, lagos, and, calabar, no, elections, were, held, elsewhere, in, 1934, the, warrant, chiefs, were, abolished, in, 1935, the, railway, network, reached, its, maximum, expansion, after, the, last, investment, projects, were, completed, it, comprised, 2, 851, km, of, track, with, a, gauge, of, 106, 7, cm, cape, gauge, and, 214, km, with, a, gauge, of, 76, 2, cm, this, made, the, nigerian, railway, network, the, longest, and, most, complex, in, west, and, central, africa,

first, industrial, union, the, railway, workers, union, was, also, founded, in, 1931, by, lathe, operator, michael, imoudu, in, 1939, trade, unions, were, permitted, by, decree, by, the, colonial, administration, but, imoudu, was, arrested, in, 1943, the, railway, workers, union, was, considered, the, most, militant, workers, union, in, nigeria, imoudu, remained, under, house, arrest, until, 1945, governor, cameron, standardised, the, administration, of, the, northern, and, southern, provinces, in, the, 1930s, by, introducing, a, native, appellate, court, system, high, courts, and, magistrate, courts, bernard, bourdillon, became, governor, of, nigeria, in, 1935, and, remained, so, for, eight, years, he, maintained, close, contact, with, local, politicians, especially, the, nym, bourdillon, who, always, opposed, any, form, of, racism, was, presumably, the, only, governor, in, nigeria, who, saw, himself, as, a, representative, of, the, country, s, interests, especially, against, prevailing, views, in, the, mother, country, in, the, colonial, office, he, succeeded, in, 1938, in, ensuring, that, the, purchasing, cartel, for, west, african, products, such, as, cocoa, palm, oil, and, peanuts, was, no, longer, supported, by, the, british, government, the, cartel, included, companies, such, as, unilever, nestl, cadbury, fry, s, swiss, african, trading, co, cfao,

spain, entering, the, war, alongside, the, third, reich, and, fascist, italy, as, early, as, 1939, the, nigeria, supply, board, was, set, up, to, promote, the, production, of, rubber, and, palm, oil, which, were, considered, important, for, the, war, effort, at, the, expense, of, food, production, the, import, of, agricultural, products, was, restricted, from, 1942, farmers, were, only, allowed, to, sell, rice, maize, beans, etc, to, government, agencies, and, at, a, very, low, price, under, the, pullen, scheme, so, that, the, british, isles, which, were, cut, off, from, the, continent, could, be, supplied, with, food, at, low, cost, however, this, price, control, motivated, farmers, to, either, not, sell, their, products, at, all, or, to, sell, them, on, the, black, market, others, may, have, resorted, to, growing, unregulated, i, e, inedible, produce, nigeria, s, agriculture, which, had, already, suffered, from, the, european, purchasing, cartels, especially, unilever, and, the, great, depression, was, once, again, hampered, in, its, development, in, december, 1942, consumer, goods, were, rationed, rationing, would, last, until, 1948, the, transport, of, rice, from, abeokuta, to, nearby, lagos, was, criminalised, as, a, positive, effect, of, the, second, world, war, the, colonial, administration, trained, war, critical, skilled, labour, such, as, technicians, electricians, nurses, carpenters, and, clerks, on, a, large, scale, during, this, period, new, harbours, and, for, the, first, time, airports, were, built, from, october, 1941, to, january, 1945, the, 44th, british, general, hospital, was, stationed, in, abeokuta, not, far, from, lagos, soldiers, airmen, and, sailors, could, recover, from, their, injuries, here, there, was, also, the, 46th,

fought, in, india, three, battalions, of, the, nigeria, regiment, fought, in, the, ethiopian, campaign, against, fascist, italy, on, 26, march, 1941, two, motorised, companies, of, the, nigeria, regiment, advanced, 930, km, from, kenya, to, daghabur, within, 10, days, in, mussolini, controlled, ethiopia, on, 26, march, the, nigeria, regiment, captured, harar, near, djibouti, after, an, advance, of, 1, 600, km, in, 32, days, at, the, time, this, was, the, fastest, military, advance, in, world, history, the, advance, also, divided, the, fascist, sphere, of, control, in, east, africa, in, their, hasty, retreat, the, italian, forces, also, left, behind, important, ammunition, and, food, depots, addis, ababa, was, conquered, by, the, allies, on, 6, april, the, ethiopian, campaign, became, the, allies, first, major, success, against, the, axis, powers, not, least, due, to, the, blitzkrieg, of, the, nigeria, regiment, with, east, africa, 1, 9, million, km, 2, italy, lost, an, area, in, a, few, days, that, was, larger, than, today, s, poland, belarus, ukraine, and, the, baltic, states, combined, 1, 3, million, km, 2, fighting, for, the, allies, were, 600, 000, volunteers, from, africa, who, had, been, promised, equal, brotherhood, in, arms, with, their, caucasian, fellow, soldiers, nevertheless, they, received, less, pay, than, their, european, or, asian, counterparts, corporal, punishment, flogging, was, also, still, a, disciplinary, punishment, exclusively, for, black, soldiers, in, northern, nigeria, it, is, not, necessarily, possible, to, speak, of, voluntary, recruits, as, the, local, tribal, chiefs, were, prescribed, contingents, of, volunteers, as, part, of, the, indirect, rule, the, absolutist, rulers, did, not, necessarily, take, into, account, the, voluntary, nature, of, the, troops, when, providing, them, for, service, at, the, front, during, the, war, none, of, the, commanding, officers, of, the, nigerian, corps, came, from, nigeria, the, first, nigerian, officers, received, their, licences, at, the, end, of, the, war, the, nigerian, soldiers, can, hardly, have, been, unaware, of, the, contradiction, between, their, reality, and, the, propagated, british, interpretation, of, wanting, to, protect, africa, from, german, and, italian, colonisation, in, addition, the, nigerian, troops, had, been, fighting, alongside, their, indian, comrades, for, several, years, and, there, was, already, a, strong, and, media, effective, independence, movement, against, british, colonial, rule, in, their, homeland, under, mahatma, gandhi, india, became, independent, just, 22, months, after, the, second, world, war, the, exchange, of, ideas, with, the, indians, striving, for, independence, almost, certainly, contributed, to, the, fact, that, nigerian, soldiers, returned, home, from, burma, in, january, 1946, with, completely, new, ideas, about, an, independent, nigeria, but, with, less, patience, in, his, victory, speech, the, commander, of, the, troops, in, burma, sir, william, slim, did, not, mention, the, nigerian, brothers, in, arms, at, all, during, the, second, world, war, the, number, of, nigerian, trade, union, members, had, increased, sixfold, to, 30, 000, a, general, strike, by, railway, workers, for, higher, wages, and, for, the, release, of, imprisoned, trade, unionists, such, as, michael, imoudu, see, above, made, it, clear, in, 1945, that, the, previous, colonial, administration, had, to, be, replaced, by, a, new, national, form, of, government, the, new, governor, of, nigeria, richards, like, graeme, thomson, and, bourdillon, an, oxford, man, introduced, a, constitution, in, 1946, that, turned, the, country, into, a, federation, consisting, of, three, states, with, uninspiring, names, such, as, northern, western, eastern, region, and, their, own, parliaments, governments, and, constitutions, the, east, had, one, house, of, parliament, the, west, and, north, a, bicameral, system, these, would, establish, a, central, government, for, customs, matters, common, foreign, policy, and, defence, in, retrospect, the, richards, constitution, must, be, viewed, critically, and, it, was, also, viewed, critically, by, nigerians, at, the, time, money, was, collected, in, a, campaign, to, enable, the, three, most, respected, compatriots, newspaper, publisher, macaulay, trade, union, leader, imoudu, and, journalist, azikiwe, to, travel, to, london, to, present, their, views, ultimately, unsuccessfully, to, the, attlee, government, there, the, british, government, in, faraway, london, was, apparently, of, the, opinion, that, it, knew, better, what, was, good, for, nigerians, than, nigerians, themselves, after, all, the, constitution, was, slightly, modified, in, 1951, and, 1954, the, last, version, finally, adopted, by, and, named, after, the, colonial, minister, oliver, lyttelton, the, son, of, the, 4th, baron, lyttleton, and, later, himself, 1st, viscount, chandos, was, the, constitution, with, which, nigeria, would, become, independent, in, 1960, although, there, had, been, two, conferences, on, the, subject, one, in, london, the, other, in, lagos, these, only, had, an, advisory, function, the, constitution, of, independent, nigeria, of, 1960, was, not, the, result, of, a, constituent, assembly, of, nigerians, but, a, creation, of, british, colonial, ministers, and, governors, among, whom, both, english, aristocrats, and, oxford, graduates, were, still, predominant, at, the, time, representatives, of, the, british, upper, class, in, this, federation, of, just, three, federal, states, the, political, process, naturally, became, more, of, a, conflict, than, a, co, operation, accordingly, the, dominant, political, parties, were, organised, along, ethnic, lines, in, 1952, the, regional, parliaments, were, elected, for, the, northern, state, this, was, the, first, free, election, in, its, history, as, expected, all, three, parties, won, a, majority, in, their, respective, states, and, ethnic, groups, with, bello, azikiwe, and, awolowo, becoming, prime, ministers, of, their, respective, states, the, governments, of, the, north, south, west, and, south, east, each, constitutionally, sent, three, ministers, to, the, central, government, in, lagos, accordingly, state, revenues, were, also, distributed, according, to, a, population, proportion, determined, in, nigeria, s, first, census, in, 1953, previously, there, had, only, been, estimates, the, precarious, balance, only, lasted, with, the, british, as, the, tip, of, the, scales, but, for, the, nascent, nation, of, nigeria, without, the, british, it, was, only, a, preliminary, stage, that, would, last, until, one, of, the, three, ethnic, groups, no, longer, felt, sufficiently, represented, in, the, federation, the, main, candidate, for, this, was, northern, nigeria, and, during, the, kano, riots, of, may, 1953, secession, was, a, distinct, possibility, many, hausa, and, fulani, favoured, a, separate, muslim, majority, state, over, the, planned, all, nigeria, this, was, also, due, to, the, jurisprudence, in, the, north, in, the, 1950s, civil, and, criminal, law, was, still, administered, in, northern, nigeria, by, emirs, i, e, by, hereditary, nobility, not, by, trained, lawyers, in, accordance, with, sharia, law, for, northern, nigerians, it, was, hardly, acceptable, that, this, legal, system, should, in, future, be, given, a, higher, instance, in, the, form, of, the, supreme, court, in, which, non, muslims, and, academically, trained, experts, without, a, noble, title, would, also, be, represented, on, the, other, hand, the, south, of, nigeria, had, co, financed, the, poor, north, in, every, fiscal, year, since, 1914, this, has, not, changed, until, 2023, and, even, the, most, ardent, advocates, of, a, northern, state, did, not, dare, to, make, the, necessary, tax, increases, palatable, to, their, supporters, the, funding, dilemma, initially, delayed, further, endeavours, for, such, a, separate, northern, state, and, ultimately, prevented, it, in, january, 1956, the, first, oil, field, in, nigeria, the, olobiri, oilfield, in, the, south, south, of, the, country, was, discovered, the, new, conservative, government, in, the, united, kingdom, under, harold, macmillan, had, been, advocating, rapid, decolonisation, in, the, british, empire, since, 10, january, 1957, following, the, debacle, in, the, suez, crisis, and, in, view, of, the, high, costs, of, the, loss, making, colonial, system, in, just, a, few, years, great, britain, granted, independence, to, a, good, dozen, african, colonies, however, unlike, nearby, ghana, for, example, nigeria, had, not, fought, for, its, independence, it, had, virtually, slipped, out, of, britain, s, faint, hand, exhausted, by, the, second, world, war, and, fallen, into, the, lap, of, the, unprepared, colony, the, nigerian, independence, movement, lacked, both, the, unifying, experience, of, a, struggle, for, freedom, and, the, confirmation, of, a, joint, success, against, the, former, colonial, power, on, 30, august, 1957, the, former, transport, minister, abubakar, tafawa, balewa, became, the, first, prime, minister, of, nigeria, s, weak, central, government, from, 1958, onwards, the, nigerian, army, no, longer, recruited, men, exclusively, from, the, north, as, before, but, from, all, over, the, country, in, the, following, years, this, meant, that, officer, candidates, from, the, south, predominantly, occupied, the, numerous, positions, of, the, outgoing, british, officers, as, they, were, generally, highly, educated, this, clashed, with, the, older, officers, and, sergeant, majors, who, had, been, taught, that, their, people, hausa, fulani, kanuri, belonged, to, the, warrior, peoples, and, that, representatives, of, the, southern, ethnic, groups, yoruba, and, igbo, were, not, entitled, to, the, new, positions, this, conflict, was, to, trigger, the, biafra, war, in, 1966, the, first, all, nigerian, parliament, was, elected, at, the, end, of, 1959, the, parties, which, saw, themselves, primarily, as, representatives, of, ethnic, groups, or, regions, won, according, to, their, population, strength, the, northern, peoples, congress, won, 148, of, the, 312, seats, in, the, house, of, representatives, and, formed, a, coalition, with, several, minor, parties, to, gain, an, absolute, majority, in, order, to, keep, the, giant, of, africa, under, control, and, partly, because, of, racial, ideology, the, british, colonial, government, treated, the, ethnic, and, social, groups, in, the, country, very, unequally, for, decades, in, the, north, absolutist, feudal, systems, and, until, 1936, even, slave, owning, systems, had, been, supported, financially, and, militarily, while, in, the, south, conditions, had, been, created, that, at, least, did, not, appear, too, alien, to, the, europeans, there, in, addition, as, in, francophone, countries, an, upper, class, educated, in, the, mother, country, had, been, brought, up, which, only, looked, down, on, other, compatriots, in, just, a, few, years, this, development, split, would, undo, all, colonial, investments, and, development, efforts, in, the, now, independent, nigeria, on, october, 1, 1960, nigeria, was, granted, independence, by, an, act, of, the, british, parliament, and, admitted, to, the, united, nations, at, first, glance, the, balance, sheet, of, british, colonial, rule, in, nigeria, appears, quite, positive, the, british, put, an, end, to, human, sacrifice, slavery, cannibalism, trials, by, ordeal, and, the, killing, of, newborn, twins, and, servants, of, the, deceased, in, their, colony, islamic, courts, were, forbidden, to, use, torture, for, finding, out, the, truth, or, stoning, and, mutilation, as, punishment, for, the, first, time, intent, of, malice, was, taken, into, account, in, court, proceedings, british, missionaries, founded, schools, hospitals, and, libraries, british, colonial, officials, created, an, efficient, administration, a, postal, and, telegraph, network, paved, roads, and, built, ports, and, an, extensive, rail, network, the, colonial, administration, forced, the, nigerians, into, the, unavoidable, cash, economy, with, poll, taxes, unlike, other, colonial, powers, it, allowed, a, free, press, political, parties, trade, unions, retail, trade, associations, and, women, s, organizations, the, socio, political, activist, deji, adeyanju, therefore, claimed, in, 2022, that, nigeria, was, better, off, under, the, colonial, masters, than, under, the, new, indigenous, politicians, like, adeyanju, some, nigerians, today, see, the, colonial, era, as, a, belle, poque, beautiful, era, in, which, righteous, colonial, officials, administered, the, country, foreigners, invested, in, nigeria, and, money, was, still, worth, something, however, the, achievements, listed, above, came, from, an, autocratic, system, of, rule, that, ran, counter, to, traditional, british, achievements, such, as, parliamentarianism, or, the, rule, of, law, and, would, never, be, accepted, in, the, mother, country, the, british, only, dared, to, introduce, democracy, for, the, whole, of, nigeria, when, they, realized, that, they, themselves, would, soon, be, leaving, the, governor, enacted, laws, and, even, a, constitution, in, 1946, without, the, participation, of, an, elected, parliament, without, responsible, ministers, and, against, the, justified, protest, of, the, most, respected, nigerians, such, an, absolutist, form, of, rule, had, already, been, abolished, in, great, britain, in, 1688, with, the, glorious, revolution, the, lowest, court, instance, did, not, allow, representation, by, lawyers, a, circumstance, that, the, british, had, already, abolished, in, their, own, country, in, 1275, and, which, denied, the, simpler, nigerians, legal, recourse, from, the, outset, for, nigerians, who, grew, up, colonially, it, must, have, seemed, that, civilizational, progress, was, only, possible, under, autocratic, rule, later, nigerian, dictators, from, agulyi, ironsi, to, abacha, learned, from, the, british, governors, and, imitated, them, after, 1960, nigerians, would, see, that, unlike, the, british, colonial, administration, indigenous, dictatorships, would, not, bring, progress, but, would, lead, to, arbitrary, rule, war, and, genocide, the, british, induced, development, gap, between, north, and, south, the, british, failure, to, exemplify, democracy, and, the, british, reinforced, nigerian, racism, between, ethnic, groups, would, undo, all, colonial, investments, and, development, efforts, in, the, now, independent, nigeria, within, a, few, years, on, 1, october, 1960, nigeria, gained, full, independence, from, the, united, kingdom, on, the, basis, of, a, federal, constitution, with, three, large, states, having, a, weak, central, government, over, them, ncnc, chairman, nnamdi, azikiwe, replaced, the, colonial, governor, general, james, wilson, robertson, in, november, 1960, and, elizabeth, ii, remained, head, of, state, for, the, time, being, the, npc, and, ncnc, remained, the, governing, parties, with, the, ag, now, in, opposition, in, this, ag, the, yoruba, party, there, was, a, bitter, power, struggle, between, obefemi, awolowo, who, advocated, a, socialist, course, and, sought, to, close, ranks, with, the, soviet, union, and, the, conservative, prime, minister, of, the, south, west, samuel, ak, nt, l, who, wanted, to, improve, co, operation, with, the, northern, party, npc, this, internal, party, dispute, became, so, heated, that, the, central, government, under, balewa, had, to, impose, a, state, of, emergency, on, the, south, west, in, may, 1962, ak, nt, l, eventually, founded, a, new, party, the, nndp, which, would, win, the, disputed, 1964, elections, in, an, electoral, alliance, with, the, npc, from, then, on, ak, nt, l, was, seen, in, his, region, as, a, vicarious, agent, of, the, backward, and, feudal, north, which, would, cost, him, his, life, in, 1966, on, 1, june, 1961, nigeria, received, the, north, cameroons, a, muslim, dominated, strip, of, land, on, the, border, with, cameroon, following, a, referendum, the, predominantly, christian, inhabitants, of, the, south, cameroons, bordering, biafra, decided, against, the, muslim, dominated, and, unstable, nigeria, and, in, favour, of, belonging, to, christian, dominated, cameroon, both, cameroons, were, previously, under, un, administration, the, bakassi, peninsula, remained, disputed, nigeria, received, a, new, constitution, in, 1963, nigeria, became, a, republic, the, british,

opposition, while, the, hausa, fulani, dominated, politics, and, the, lower, ranks, of, the, army, up, to, the, sergeant, major, ranks, their, northern, state, was, larger, than, would, have, been, suggested, by, the, border, between, the, three, main, ethnic, groups, or, between, the, predominant, denominations, of, islam, and, christianity, the, northern, region, therefore, included, not, only, muslim, hausa, and, fulbe, for, whom, it, was, politically, in, favour, but, who, made, up, barely, more, than, a, quarter, of, the, population, but, also, considerable, minorities, of, christians, followers, of, natural, religions, yoruba, igbo, and, other, minorities, such, as, the, tiv, when, the, politically, and, militarily, dominant, northern, region, which, was, chronically, short, of, funds, wanted, to, impose, a, special, tax, the, jizya, on, the, predominantly, christian, tiv, in, the, same, year, riots, broke, out, in, the, affected, region, 4, 000, people, were, killed, one, had, to, wonder, how, many, lives, would, be, lost, if, for, example, the, much, more, numerous, igbo, were, to, rise, up, and, it, was, not, about, a, special, tax, but, about, the, lucrative, oil, business, in, igboland, in, the, south, west, the, unrest, worsened, in, 1965, because, the, election, results, had, apparently, been, falsified, or, were, the, result, of, intimidation, and, the, government, had, halved, the, state, guaranteed, producer, prices, for, cocoa, immediately, after, the, election, there, was, arson, and, looting, dozens, of, political, opponents, were, tracked, down, in, places, like, ekiti, or, ijebu, ode, both, not, far, from, lagos, doused, with, petrol, and, set, on, fire, operation, wetie, thugs, controlled, the, streets, by,

statements, the, coup, plotters, were, not, pursuing, ethnic, goals, but, wanted, to, strike, at, the, heart, of, a, backward, state, dominated, by, the, north, following, the, violent, death, of, prime, minister, balewa, parliamentary, president, orizu, an, igbo, transferred, government, power, to, the, army, chief, agulyi, ironsi, also, an, igbo, with, his, first, decree, he, abolished, the, constitution, and, freedom, of, the, press, and, dissolved, parliament, remaining, ministers, were, forced, to, resign, and, from, then, on, the, head, of, state, ruled, by, means, of, directives, issued, by, his, staff, ironsi, abolished, the, three, federal, states, and, made, nigeria, a, unitary, state, for, the, first, time, a, country, in, which, all, laws, all, taxes, etc, applied, equally, everywhere, without, regional, variations, nigeria, was, to, be, forced, to, progress, by, directive, so, to, speak, this, was, inevitably, viewed, badly, in, the, backward, north, in, addition, the, military, government, was, reluctant, to, take, action, against, igbo, involved, in, the, coup, ironsi, was, igbo, himself, and, used, the, more, highly, educated, igbo, in, the, north, to, implement, the, supposedly, progressive, decisions, of, the, central, government, on, the, ground, for, other, ethnic, groups, it, must, have, seemed, as, if, the, igbo, wanted, to, take, over, the, country, however, the, nigerian, army, in, 1966, did, not, consist, predominantly, of, south, eastern, majors, with, british, sandhurst, training, but, as, in, lugard, s, time, mainly, of, soldiers, and, sergeants, from, the, north, with, very, limited, education, on, 29, july, 1966, soldiers, staged, a, coup, in, abeokuta, in, the, south, west, and, murdered, agulyi, ironsi, who, was, visiting, nearby, ibadan, pogroms, against, the, igbo, broke, out, across, the, country, with, sources, claiming, 30, 000, victims, mostly, children, in, this, situation, the, coup, plotters, appointed, lieutenant, colonel, yakubu, jack, gowon, as, the, new, military, and, state, leader, and, reintroduced, federalism, gowon, did, not, belong, to, any, of, the, three, predominant, ethnic, groups, and, was, confronted, with, the, task, of, keeping, the, three, divergent, parts, of, his, country, and, ethnic, groups, together, and, putting, an, end, to, the, pogroms, under, these, circumstances, it, seemed, unlikely, that, yakubu, gowon, s, rule, would, last, comparatively, long, nine, years, however, one, of, the, worst, humanitarian, disasters, of, modern, times, occurred, during, this, period, the, biafra, war, in, september, 1966, the, pogroms, against, the, igbo, reached, their, peak, an, estimated, 1, million, igbo, fled, from, all, over, the, country, to, the, south, east, where, they, believed, they, were, safe, in, may, 1967, the, governor, of, the, eastern, region, lieutenant, colonel, emeka, ojukwu, proclaimed, it, an, independent, state, the, republic, of, biafra, following, this, declaration, of, independence, the, remaining, nigerian, forces, attacked, biafra, at, garkem, on, 6, july, 1967, nigeria, was, ill, prepared, for, this, situation, due, to, the, liquidation, of, leading, officers, during, the, previous, coups, as, a, result, the, biafran, forces, were, able, to, advance, westwards, to, benin, city, in, august, 1967, biafra, was, besieged, and, cut, off, from, trade, without, either, side, being, able, to, make, decisive, military, movements, it, was, not, until, december, 1969, that, colonel, obasanjo, advanced, to, umuahia, with, 30, 000, troops, splitting, biafra, in, two, this, decided, the, war, the, hostilities, finally, ended, after, 30, months, in, january, 1970, the, biafra, region, which, had, already, had, to, cope, with, an, unprecedented, wave, of, refugees, was, no, longer, able, to, feed, its, inhabitants, due, to, the, trade, blockade, estimates, of, the, number, of, deaths, caused, by, hunger, and, acts, of, war, during, the, civil, war, range, from, one, to, three, million, photographs, of, starving, children, in, biafra, went, around, the, world, and, characterised, the, image, of, post, colonial, africa, in, addition, to, acts, of, war, and, hunger, genocides, against, unarmed, civilians, claimed, numerous, victims, these, include, for, example, the, massacre, of, asaba, when, nigerian, troops, conquered, the, igbo, majority, town, in, the, midwest, in, october, 1967, the, citizens, were, ordered, to, attend, an, ordered, celebration, in, the, town, s, central, square, the, 4, 000, unarmed, civilians, who, were, gullible, enough, to, comply, were, separated, by, gender, the, men, were, murdered, on, the, spot, in, front, of, the, women, and, children, john, martin, caterer, on, a, mail, steamer, and, british, citizen, remembers, terrible, events, in, september, 1967, arriving, in, lagos, and, before, the, ship, could, clear, the, army, came, on, board, and, assembled, all, the, africans, on, board, passengers, and, crew, in, the, dining, saloon, they, started, to, segregate, them, with, an, officer, identifying, nationality, and, nigerian, tribal, affiliations, even, by, cheek, scarring, our, master, at, arms, was, recruited, to, help, the, master, at, arms, was, a, nigerian, who, travelled, between, lagos, and, freetown, and, return, overseeing, the, deck, passengers, who, we, picked, up, along, the, coast, from, freetown, and, those, travelling, back, from, lagos, in, effect, he, was, the, security, officer, ensuring, these, passengers, had, bonafide, tickets, and, they, didn, t, stray, into, other, passenger, areas, of, the, ship, despite, the, efforts, of, captain, hutchinson, insisting, the, crew, were, under, his, protection, claiming, the, authority, of, the, british, flag, those, identified, as, igbo, s, the, last, being, the, master, at, arms, himself, were, taken, off, the, ship, under, armed, escort, the, last, we, saw, of, them, was, being, taken, round, back, of, the, sheds, gunfire, was, heard, bodies, were, seen, floating, in, the, lagoon, on, an, outgoing, tide, events, like, these, have, never, been, processed, leading, officers, of, the, nigerian, army, during, the, civil, war, such, as, obasanjo, babangida, and, buhari, were, even, head, of, state, some, even, several, times, and, continue, to, be, influential, in, nigerian, politics, as, of, 2024, igbo, remain, second, class, nigerians, to, this, day, possibly, due, to, their, high, level, of, assimilation, to, western, culture, and, high, educational, qualifications, the, federal, government, was, only, able, to, defeat, the, insurgents, in, biafra, with, great, difficulty, the, fact, that, they, succeeded, in, the, end, was, mainly, due, to, the, officers, murtala, muhammed, and, olusegun, obasanjo, who, themselves, became, dictators, a, few, years, later, after, gowon, s, overthrow, gowon, had, increased, the, number, of, federal, states, in, nigeria, to, 12, in, 1967, with, this, strategic, move, he, blocked, the, realistic, opportunity, for, both, the, south, east, and, the, north, to, establish, their, own, state, won, over, the, minorities, to, which, he, himself, belonged, and, which, make, up, 30, of, the, nigerian, population, and, by, skilfully, drawing, the, borders, of, the, federal, states, deprived, the, igbo, of, control, over, both, the, oil, wells, and, the, seaports, this, fundamentally, changed, the, federal, character, of, nigeria, but, it, remained, federal, nigeria, joined, opec, in, 1971, it, experienced, a, dynamic, economic, boom, during, the, 1974, oil, crisis, which, mainly, triggered, inflation, and, was, confronted, with, declining, demand, and, mass, unemployment, in, 1975, during, these, years, the, north, also, experienced, the, worst, drought, since, 1914, dictator, gowon, s, 1972, nationalisation, decree, closed, many, sectors, of, the, nigerian, economy, to, all, foreign, investment, and, banned, foreign, participation, beyond, a, minority, stake, in, several, other, areas, this, decree, proved, detrimental, to, investment, in, the, nigerian, economy, on, 1, october, 1974, in, contradiction, to, earlier, statements, gowon, declared, that, nigeria, was, not, ready, for, civilian, rule, until, 1976, and, he, postponed, the, handover, date, indefinitely, under, gowon, perceived, corruption, increased, especially, among, military, government, officials, although, gowon, himself, was, never, implicated, in, the, corrupt, practices, he, was, often, accused, of, turning, a, blind, eye, to, the, activities, of, his, associates, and, acquaintances, newspapers, reported, on, bribery, and, nepotism, theft, and, embezzlement, in, hospitals, and, orphanages, outraged, the, nigerian, public, medicines, imported, by, officials, at, full, price, which, had, long, expired, showed, that, those, involved, were, also, indifferent, to, human, lives, in, addition, the, formerly, efficient, administration, became, bloated, and, was, overburdened, even, with, simpler, tasks, the, mismanagement, in, gowon, s, administration, culminated, in, the, infamous, cement, armada, in, the, summer, of, 1975, when, the, port, of, lagos, was, overcrowded, with, hundreds, of, ships, trying, to, unload, cement, representatives, of, the, nigerian, government, had, signed, contracts, with, 68, different, international, suppliers, to, deliver, a, total, of, 20, million, tonnes, of, cement, to, lagos, in, one, year, even, though, the, port, could, only, take, one, million, tonnes, of, cargo, per, year, the, poorly, drafted, cement, contracts, contained, demurrage, clauses, that, were, very, favourable, to, the, suppliers, so, that, the, bill, would, skyrocket, as, the, ships, waited, in, port, to, unload, or, even, as, they, waited, in, their, home, ports, for, permission, to, leave, for, nigeria, the, nigerian, government, only, realised, the, extent, of, its, mistake, when, the, port, of, lagos, became, so, congested, that, basic, supplies, could, no, longer, be, guaranteed, their, attempts, to, cancel, the, cement, contracts, and, impose, an, emergency, embargo, on, all, incoming, ships, kept, the, country, busy, with, litigation, around, the, world, for, many, years, including, a, 1983, u, s, supreme, court, decision, due, to, the, turmoil, of, the, second, world, war, and, nigeria, s, looming, independence, the, infrastructure, e, g, the, railway, network, was, no, longer, expanded, and, was, no, longer, maintained, after, the, outbreak, of, the, biafra, war, in, 1966, nigeria, s, railway, system, became, increasingly, dilapidated, this, also, applies, to, the, railway, networks, of, other, west, african, countries, after, their, independence, as, a, result, by, the, 1990s, nigeria, s, railway, system, had, deteriorated, to, the, point, where, it, was, almost, completely, non, functional, large, sections, of, track, were, missing, or, unusable, locomotives, and, rolling, stock, were, in, an, advanced, state, of, disrepair, and, the, system, could, no, longer, provide, reliable, service, expertise, was, lost, training, institutions, no, longer, received, funding, and, ceased, operations, it, was, not, until, 2009, that, nigeria, began, to, renovate, and, lay, new, tracks, again, for, billions, of, euros, with, chinese, aid, see, nigerian, railway, corporation, but, the, country, will, still, be, operating, barely, more, than, the, colonial, line, length, in, 2023, scandals, and, the, obvious, mismanagement, caused, dissatisfaction, within, the, army, on, 29, july, 1975, when, gowon, attended, an, oau, summit, in, kampala, a, group, of, officers, led, by, colonel, joe, nanven, garba, announced, his, overthrow, on, 29, july, 1975, general, yakubu, gowon, was, overthrown, while, attending, the, 12th, summit, of, the, organisation, of, african, unity, oau, in, kampala, uganda, murtala, muhammed, assumed, power, as, the, new, military, head, of, state, he, was, considered, brilliant, and, bold, but, also, unpredictable, and, impetuous, murtala, muhammed, also, took, control, of, the, two, largest, newspapers, in, the, country, daily, times, and, new, nigerian, all, media, in, nigeria, were, now, under, state, control, he, also, took, control, of, the, remaining, state, universities, in, a, short, time, murtala, muhammed, s, policies, gained, wide, popular, support, and, his, determination, made, him, a, popular, hero, however, his, highly, popular, but, impulsive, style, of, governance, and, often, televised, speeches, with, the, frequent, addition, of, with, immediate, effect, also, earned, him, criticism, among, the, country, s, top, officials, his, ad, hoc, declarations, often, left, his, officials, unprepared, lacking, details, and, lacking, the, financial, resources, to, implement, his, ideas, shortly, after, taking, power, muhammed, realised, that, state, revenues, were, falling, due, to, low, oil, production, global, demand, for, oil, had, collapsed, spare, parts, had, become, more, expensive, and, labour, costs, had, risen, as, a, result, the, military, government, lacked, the, funds, to, fulfil, the, nigerian, development, plan, for, 1975, murtala, muhammed, then, carried, out, a, dramatic, downsizing, of, the, bloated, and, inefficient, civil, service, operation, deadwood, more, than, 10, 000, government, employees, were, dismissed, without, transitional, benefits, numerous, civil, servants, were, tried, for, corruption, and, a, military, governor, was, executed, for, gross, abuse, of, office, however, due, to, the, drastic, nature, of, the, purge, accusations, were, made, that, personal, scores, were, also, settled, in, the, process, of, streamlining, the, civil, service, on, 13, february, 1976, muhammed, was, driving, to, work, in, his, unarmoured, mercedes, benz, 230, 6, unaccompanied, by, bodyguards, or, the, like, shortly, after, 8, a, m, his, car, was, driving, slowly, through, the, notorious, lagos, traffic, when, a, group, of, soldiers, emerged, from, a, neighbouring, petrol, station, ambushed, the, vehicle, and, murdered, the, unarmed, muhammed, this, was, part, of, an, attempted, coup, d, tat, by, lieutenant, colonel, dimka, who, was, executed, on, 15, may, 1976, for, treason, muhammed, s, successor, was, the, chief, of, staff, of, the, supreme, headquarters, olusegun, obasanjo, who, had, escaped, assassination, through, a, case, of, mistaken, identity, the, murtala, muhammed, international, airport, in, lagos, is, named, after, the, still, popular, military, ruler, who, is, also, inaccurately, referred, to, as, the, nigerian, kennedy, olusegun, obasanjo, formed, a, triumvirate, with, two, other, generals, and, increased, general, repression, the, most, famous, example, is, probably, the, raid, on, the, home, of, musician, fela, kuti, during, which, female, family, members, were, raped, and, his, mother, was, thrown, out, of, a, window, suffering, fatal, injuries, trade, union, activities, were, restricted, dimka, and, 37, of, his, comrades, in, arms, were, executed, obasanjo, swiftly, convened, a, committee, to, draft, a, new, constitution, modelling, it, on, the, us, system, even, before, a, result, was, achieved, obasanjo, increased, the, number, of, federal, states, to, 19, the, draft, of, the, new, constitution, was, very, similar, to, today, s, nigerian, constitution, and, summarised, the, position, of, the, head, of, state, and, the, head, of, government, the, powerful, position, of, the, president, was, balanced, by, two, chambers, the, constitution, was, promulgated, in, september, 1978, the, five, parties, that, ran, their, own, presidential, candidates, in, the, 1979, election, showed, less, vision, than, the, above, committee, and, focussed, as, in, the, first, republic, but, against, obasanjo, s, express, wishes, primarily, on, representing, ethnic, groups, despite, the, past, 20, years, and, a, survived, civil, war, the, new, party, landscape, was, to, a, certain, extent, a, copy, of, the, old, one, accordingly, each, party, won, by, over, 80, per, cent, in, the, state, where, it, represented, the, majority, of, the, population, the, ethnic, group, that, had, the, largest, share, of, nigeria, s, population, still, northern, nigerians, won, the, election, with, its, party, and, provided, the, new, president, alhaji, shehu, shagari, so, before, it, had, begun, the, second, republic, was, already, suffering, from, the, same, problem, as, the, first, republic, a, party, landscape, that, had, been, formed, along, ethnic, lines, rather, than, ideological, or, programmatic, standpoints, on, 1, october, 1979, shehu, shagari, was, sworn, in, as, the, first, president, and, commander, in, chief, of, the, federal, republic, of, nigeria, as, his, party, the, npn, had, barely, more, than, 35, of, the, seats, in, the, senate, and, the, house, of, representatives, shagari, formed, a, coalition, with, the, npp, which, had, become, the, third, strongest, party, in, the, parliamentary, elections, this, coalition, had, a, slim, majority, in, both, chambers, shagari, relied, on, large, scale, industry, and, in, agriculture, on, the, green, revolution, that, corresponded, to, the, current, state, of, science, at, the, time, preference, for, large, farms, intensive, use, of, fertilisers, and, pesticides, use, of, machinery, drilling, of, deep, groundwater, etc, the, green, revolution, is, viewed, rather, critically, today, 2023, in, 1980, shagari, laid, the, foundation, stone, for, the, ajaokuta, steelworks, which, was, to, be, built, by, a, soviet, state, owned, company, near, the, niger, river, and, the, itakpe, ore, mine, by, 1991, 98, of, the, steelworks, which, was, to, be, built, to, soviet, standards, i, e, on, a, very, large, scale, had, been, constructed, however, by, 1991, the, soviet, union, had, dissolved, world, demand, for, steel, had, changed, unfavourably, and, technology, had, developed, further, the, steelworks, was, not, completed, and, had, still, not, started, operations, in, 1994, which, according, to, russian, wikipedia, articles, on, the, subject, was, entirely, due, to, nigeria, ajaokuta, was, seen, as, a, prime, example, of, failed, development, aid, in, west, africa, however, by, 2017, 40, of, the, 43, plants, were, gradually, able, to, start, operations, in, 2023, ajaokuta, steel, produced, around, one, sixth, of, the, amount, of, steel, produced, by, the, uk, three, other, shagari, era, steel, plants, in, jos, oshogbo, and, katsina, appear, to, no, longer, be, active, shagari, began, the, construction, of, 200, 000, social, housing, units, across, the, country, of, which, 25, 000, were, completed, during, his, term, of, office, a, 2017, study, by, nnamdi, azikiwe, university, in, awka, criticised, the, lack, of, planning, the, completed, flats, were, not, connected, to, water, electricity, sewerage, or, transport, or, were, located, in, an, area, with, no, demand, for, new, flats, the, new, flats, were, often, never, occupied, were, not, managed, and, soon, fell, into, disrepair, shagari, s, successors, did, not, pursue, the, completion, of, the, remaining, flats, which, also, fell, into, disrepair, in, january, 1983, shagari, decided, to, deport, west, african, immigrants, under, the, slogan, ghana, must, go, in, the, face, of, an, economic, slump, an, estimated, 2, million, ghanaians, had, to, leave, the, country, suddenly, and, with, malice, leaving, most, of, their, belongings, behind, provisional, bags, and, suitcases, became, the, symbol, of, the, forced, exodus, they, are, still, called, ghana, bags, today, it, is, not, without, a, certain, irony, that, social, and, economic, development, in, ghana, after, 1983, was, to, be, much, more, favourable, than, in, nigeria, and, that, nigerians, for, their, part, would, look, for, work, and, income, in, ghana, shagari, reacted, to, falling, oil, prices, and, the, resulting, economic, downturn, by, restricting, import, licences, and, increasing, customs, duties, he, rejected, cooperation, with, the, international, monetary, fund, under, shagari, the, education, system, in, nigeria, improved, for, example, a, number, of, universities, were, founded, he, also, promoted, the, inclusion, of, women, in, political, life, he, filled, many, offices, with, women, similar, to, the, first, republic, the, northern, party, won, an, absolute, majority, in, parliament, after, a, few, years, in, government, and, no, longer, needed, coalition, partners, although, shehu, shagari, is, cleared, of, personal, involvement, in, corrupt, practices, the, second, republic, was, plagued, by, allegations, of, corruption, including, allegations, of, electoral, fraud, in, the, 1983, elections, in, his, second, term, shagari, made, attempts, to, curb, corruption, through, the, new, ministry, of, national, guidance, under, yusuf, maitama, sule, which, was, created, solely, for, this, purpose, a, new, programme, called, ethical, revolution, was, introduced, one, of, whose, initiatives, was, the, famous, war, against, indiscipline, launched, under, general, muhammadu, buhari, the, ministry, was, only, in, office, for, three, months, before, a, coup, d, tat, in, 1983, made, buhari, the, sole, ruler, the, military, coup, on, 31, december, 1983, was, coordinated, by, leading, officers, of, the, nigerian, military, and, led, to, the, overthrow, of, the, government, and, the, installation, of, major, general, muhammadu, buhari, as, head, of, state, the, inauguration, of, muhammadu, buhari, was, generally, seen, as, a, positive, development, buhari, promised, reforms, but, his, government, performed, little, better, than, that, of, his, predecessor, general, buhari, was, overthrown, in, 1985, by, a, military, coup, led, by, general, ibrahim, babangida, buhari, would, be, elected, president, 30, years, later, in, the, fourth, republic, and, now, democratically, purged, babangida, was, more, far, sighted, than, nigeria, s, previous, military, leaders, loosening, state, control, over, the, press, and, releasing, a, number, of, prisoners, however, he, faced, the, same, economic, problems, that, buhari, had, faced, and, the, same, discontent, in, the, country, babangida, soon, gained, a, reputation, as, a, clever, politician, he, asked, the, nigerian, people, whether, their, country, should, accept, a, financial, aid, package, worth, billions, from, the, international, monetary, fund, imf, when, as, he, had, expected, the, nigerian, people, refused, to, accept, the, package, babangida, suspended, talks, with, the, imf, he, then, offered, nigerians, his, own, economic, recovery, programme, which, included, many, of, the, harsh, measures, proposed, by, the, imf, and, convinced, nigerians, to, accept, it, as, a, result, of, this, programme, nigeria, received, loans, from, banks, and, gained, economic, credibility, in, western, countries, according, to, forbes, shortly, before, the, second, gulf, war, babangida, diverted, twelve, billion, us, dollars, in, unplanned, income, oil, windfall, into, his, own, pocket, the, oil, price, jumped, from, 15, to, us, 41, 15, barrel, within, weeks, in, 1990, and, then, plummeted, to, the, old, value, however, these, funds, could, never, be, found, nevertheless, the, additional, profit, of, us, 12, billion, calculated, by, forbes, could, only, have, been, realised, if, nigeria, had, sold, the, entire, annual, production, volume, of, 630, million, barrels, on, the, world, market, exactly, on, 27, september, 1990, at, the, annual, high, price, of, us, 41, barrel, 19, more, than, the, officially, stated, annual, average, of, us, 22, barrel, 630, million, barrels, us, 19, barrel, us, 11, 97, billion, this, is, unlikely, given, the, sluggishness, of, the, state, oil, company, nnpc, and, the, lack, of, ex, post, information, for, those, involved, babangida, commented, in, 2022, on, the, above, allegations, that, he, and, his, associates, were, saints, this, account, should, be, evaluated, as, cautiously, as, forbes, calculation, in, december, 1991, the, centrally, located, abuja, became, the, capital, the, babangida, regime, ensured, the, establishment, of, a, state, security, apparatus, it, survived, two, coup, attempts, general, mamman, vatsa, and, major, gideon, orkar, were, executed, and, the, critical, journalist, dele, giwa, was, murdered, in, 1989, babangida, promised, the, transition, to, the, third, nigerian, republic, babangida, survived, the, 1990, coup, attempt, and, postponed, the, promised, return, to, democracy, until, 1992, babangida, s, intelligence, cannot, be, denied, and, his, foreign, and, economic, policies, benefited, nigeria, the, security, apparatus, and, secret, service, he, set, up, may, be, understandable, in, view, of, the, fate, of, military, ruler, murtala, mohammed, who, was, shot, unarmed, and, without, bodyguards, in, an, unarmoured, limousine, in,

power, and, allowed, him, to, run, for, a, second, term, were, condemned, as, unfree, and, unfair, nigeria, made, significant, progress, in, democratisation, the, fact, that, the, national, assembly, was, able, to, successfully, deny, the, president, a, third, term, despite, his, influence, on, the, army, and, security, forces, is, evidence, of, the, checks, and, balances, in, the, nigerian, government, after, 2000, the, federalist, structure, of, the, 1999, constitution, with, 36, federal, states, and, one, federal, capital, territory, fct, of, roughly, equal, size, a, senate, with, three, senators, from, each, state, as, well, as, a, blocking, minority, of, at, least, 13, states, in, the, presidential, election, must, be, considered, a, stroke, of, luck, in, view, of, the, numerous, ethnic, groups, and, the, religious, division, of, the, country, since, then, every, presidential, candidate, has, emphasised, in, their, own, interest, that, they, represent, not, only, their, own, ethnic, group, religion, but, all, nigerians, nigerian, parties, now, differentiate, themselves, primarily, in, terms, of, their, programmes, and, no, longer, according, to, ethnic,

international, observers, strongly, condemned, the, election, which, was, marred, by, irregularities, and, vote, rigging, the, international, community, which, had, observed, the, nigerian, elections, to, promote, a, free, and, fair, process, condemned, these, elections, as, seriously, flawed, outgoing, president, olusegun, obasanjo, acknowledged, fraud, and, other, shortcomings, in, the, elections, but, stated, that, the, result, was, in, line, with, the, opinion, polls, in, a, nationally, televised, address, in, 2007, he, added, that, if, nigerians, did, not, like, the, victory, of, his, hand, picked, successor, they, had, the, option, of, voting, again, in, four, years, time, however, yar, adua, s, health, would, soon, render, this, option, moot, in, 2009, yar, adua, s, term, of, office, saw, the, out, of, court, settlement, of, lawsuits, under, the, us, alien, tort, statute, against, royal, dutch, shell, and, brian, anderson, the, head, of, shell, s, nigerian, subsidiary,

adua, who, was, seriously, ill, and, receiving, treatment, abroad, for, the, remainder, of, his, term, in, office, his, priorities, were, to, solve, the, country, s, energy, problems, and, to, continue, peace, negotiations, with, the, rebels, in, the, niger, delta, jonathan, emerged, victorious, from, the, presidential, elections, second, place, went, to, former, general, and, head, of, state, muhammadu, buhari, who, received, 32, per, cent, of, the, vote, the, international, media, reported, that, the, elections, went, smoothly, unlike, previous, elections, jonathan, s, time, in, office, saw, the, successful, fight, against, ebola, and, an, economic, recovery, that, made, nigeria, the, leading, economic, power, in, africa, the, jonathan, administration, s, film, promotion, for, high, quality, productions, created, its, own, commercially, successful, film, industry, nollywood, which, can, only, be, compared, to, the, us, and, india, bollywood, on, the, debit, side, of, the, balance, sheet, on, the, other, hand, is, the, wave, of, terror, by, boko, haram, which, kidnapped, 200, schoolgirls, in, chibok, in, 2014, and, highlighted, the, impotence, of, the, nigerian, state, around, 100, of, the, girls, are, still, missing, in, 2022, jonathan, who, was, criticised, during, the, 2014, election, campaign, for, not, having, done, enough, to, combat, boko, haram, asked, the, neighbouring, countries, of, benin, cameroon, chad, and, niger, for, support, a, regional, army, was, set, up, with, troops, from, nigeria, and, the, aforementioned, countries, and, an, offensive, was, launched, against, the, terrorists, the, fight, against, boko, haram, made, significant, progress, with, armed, forces, recapturing, large, areas, previously, held, by, the, terrorist, group, the, same, sex, marriage, prohibition, act, signed, by, jonathan, in, 2014, is, one, of, the, most, repressive, draconian, laws, in, the, world, against, lgbt, people, and, those, who, may, be, considered, by, the, nigerian, judiciary, as, their, sponsors, the, law, is, also, supported, by, the, general, nigerian, population, they, even, went, on, to, praise, him, for, ensuring, that, the, law, had, been, passed, and, signed, above, all, however, jonathan, s, time, in, office, is, characterised, by, embezzlement, in, office, the, misappropriation, of, state, funds, the, nigerian, state, is, said, to, have, lost, 20, billion, us, dollars, as, a, result, the, high, level, of, corruption, was, a, decisive, factor, in, the, 2015, presidential, election, from, which, opposition, candidate, muhammadu, buhari, emerged, victorious, the, elections, were, originally, scheduled, for, mid, february, but, were, then, postponed, by, the, nigerian, electoral, commission, by, six, weeks, as, the, level, of, violence, emanating, from, boko, haram, at, the, time, was, an, obstacle, to, the, elections, in, the, north, east, jonathan, s, ouster, is, as, of, 2023, the, only, case, in, the, iv, republic, in, which, nigerian, voters, refused, to, re, elect, an, incumbent, president, jonathan, s, party, the, pdp, lost, power, after, 16, years, in, power, at, least, it, can, be, said, of, jonathan, that, he, conceded, his, electoral, defeat, without, complaint, since, the, second, republic, buhari, has, been, seen, as, the, clean, man, of, nigerian, politics, as, frugal, but, also, as, a, representative, of, northern, interests, his, party, the, all, progressives, was, only, formed, shortly, before, his, election, in, 2015, from, a, merger, of, four, opposition, parties, the, election, in, which, the, then, 72, year, old, buhari, won, on, his, fourth, attempt, was, described, by, observers, as, fair, in, 2019, buhari, was, elected, for, a, second, and, final, term, in, office, and, the, progressives, remain, the, ruling, party, to, this, day, july, 2024, during, buhari, s, two, terms, in, office, they, were, able, to, gradually, increase, the, number, of, deputies, senators, and, governors, the, buhari, era, as, of, january, 2023, is, characterised, by, a, dynamic, structural, policy, economic, diversification, successes, against, boko, haram, and, a, decreasing, perception, of, corruption, but, also, by, a, rapid, increase, in, armed, crime, and, police, attacks, while, the, covid, 19, pandemic, played, no, role, in, the, young, nigerian, population, from, 2020, in, 2022, nigeria, as, the, world, s, largest, wheat, importer, was, hit, particularly, hard, by, the, wheat, shortage, caused, by, the, russian, invasion, of, ukraine, and, the, resulting, rise, in, bread, prices, one, of, buhari, s, anti, corruption, measures, promised, in, the, 2015, election, was, the, suspension, of, the, chief, justice, of, nigeria, walter, onnoghen, investigations, by, the, code, of, conduct, bureau, ccb, a, kind, of, ethics, council, and, complaints, by, a, citizens, initiative, had, revealed, that, onnoghen, held, secret, accounts, and, did, not, declare, incoming, income, after, onnoghen, failed, to, appear, on, two, ccb, summonses, in, january, 2019, he, was, suspended, by, buhari, onnoghen, avoided, impeachment, by, the, nigerian, senate, similar, to, the, german, federal, council, by, resigning, in, december, 2019, the, attorney, general, mohammed, bello, adoke, was, convicted, of, corruption, in, absentia, and, later, extradited, from, neighbouring, niger, in, july, 2020, not, without, irony, the, chairman, of, the, commission, of, inquiry, against, corruption, efcc, ibrahim, magu, was, arrested, for, corruption, in, december, 2020, he, was, followed, by, the, chairman, of, the, pension, taskforce, abdulrasheed, maina, and, a, senator, since, corruption, takes, place, in, secret, and, is, an, emotionally, charged, issue, an, objective, assessment, is, difficult, however, unlike, in, the, 2015, election, nigerians, no, longer, see, corruption, as, the, most, important, political, issue, in, the, 2022, polls, but, place, it, behind, fighting, crime, economy, and, power, supply, this, improvement, is, not, reflected, in, the, corruption, perception, index, cpi, instead, this, assessment,
