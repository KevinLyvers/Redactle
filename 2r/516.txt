derailed, by, the, student, movement, this, created, a, major, embarrassment, loss, of, face, for, the, leadership, on, the, global, stage, and, drove, many, moderates, in, government, onto, a, more, hardline, path, the, summit, between, deng, and, gorbachev, took, place, at, the, great, hall, of, the, people, amid, the, backdrop, of, commotion, and, protest, in, the, square, when, gorbachev, met,

uncertainty, about, the, status, of, hong, kong, after, the, transfer, of, sovereignty, led, to, a, sizable, exodus, of, hong, kongers, to, western, countries, such, as, canada, and, australia, before, 1997, there, have, been, large, candlelight, vigils, attended, by, tens, of, thousands, in, hong, kong, every, year, since, 1989, even, after, the, transfer, of, power, to, china, in, 1997,

june, are, seen, as, representative, of, the, chinese, brand, of, authoritarianism, and, they, are, often, invoked, by, pro, democracy, politicians, in, hong, kong, especially, in, relation, to, democratic, reform, in, hong, kong, and, the, territory, s, relationship, with, beijing, academic, studies, indicate, that, those, who, supported, the, tiananmen, square, movement, s, rehabilitation,

seemed, to, be, becoming, a, pariah, state, increasingly, isolated, internationally, this, was, a, significant, setback, for, the, leadership, who, had, courted, international, investment, for, much, of, the, 1980s, as, the, country, emerged, from, the, chaos, of, the, cultural, revolution, however, deng, xiaoping, and, the, core, leadership, vowed, to, continue, economic, liberalization, policies, after, 1989, from, there, on, china, would, work, domestically, and, internationally, to, reshape, its, national, image, from, that, of, a, repressive, regime, to, that, of, a, benign,

neighbors, professor, suisheng, zhao, director, of, the, center, for, china, us, cooperation, at, the, university, of, denver, attributes, the, slight, impact, to, the, fact, that, the, human, rights, records, in, most, of, these, countries, were, not, better, than, china, s, to, a, certain, extent, they, were, sympathetic, to, china, s, struggle, against, pressures, from, western, countries, even, in, the, wake, of, the, crackdown, china, s, foreign, relations, with, its, neighbors, generally, improved, the, government, signed, the, non, proliferation, treaty, in, 1992, the, convention, on, chemical, weapons, in, 1993, and, the, comprehensive, test, ban, treaty, in, 1996, whereas, china, had, been, a, member, of, only, 30, international, organizations, in, 1986, it, was, a, member, of, over, 50, by, 1997, china, also, sought, to, diversify, its, external, partnerships, establishing, good, diplomatic, relations, with, post, soviet, russia, and, welcoming, taiwanese, business, in, lieu, of, western, investment, china, expedited, negotiations, with, the, world, trade, organization, and, established, relations, with, indonesia, israel, south, korea, and, others, in, 1992,

infrastructure, and, sizable, consumer, base, at, the, same, time, the, explosion, of, commercial, interest, in, the, country, opened, the, way, for, multinational, corporations, to, turn, a, blind, eye, to, politics, and, human, rights, in, favor, of, focusing, on, business, interests, since, then, western, leaders, who, were, previously, critical, of, china, have, sometimes, paid, lip, service, to, the, legacy, of, tiananmen, in, bilateral, meetings, but, the, substance, of, discussions, revolved, around, business, and, trade, interests, the, european, union, and, united, states, embargo, on, armament, sales, to, china, put, in, place, due, to, the, violent, suppression, of, the, tiananmen, square, protests, remains, in, place, today, china, has, been, calling, for, a, lift, of, the, ban, for, years, and, has, had, a, varying, amount, of, support, from, european, union, members, since, 2004, china, has, portrayed, the, ban, as, outdated, and, damaging, to, china, european, union, relations, in, early, 2004, french, president, jacques, chirac, spearheaded, a, movement, within, the, european, union, to, lift, the, ban, his, efforts, being, supported, by, german, chancellor, gerhard, schr, der, however, the, passing, of, the, anti, secession, law, of, the, people, s, republic, of, china, in, march, 2005, increased, tensions, between, mainland, china, and, taiwan, damaging, attempts, to, lift, the, ban, and, several, european, union, council, members, retracted, their, support, for, a, lift, of, the, ban, moreover, schr, der, s, successor, angela, merkel, opposed, lifting, the, ban, members, of, the, united, states, congress, had, also, proposed, restrictions, on, the, transfer, of, military, technology, to, the, european, union, if, the, latter, lifted, the, ban, the, united, kingdom, also, opposed, the, embargo, lifting, when, it, took, charge, of, the, european, union, presidency, in, july, 2005, the, european, parliament, has, consistently, opposed, the, lifting, of, the, arms, embargo, to, china, though, its, agreement, is, not, necessary, for, lifting, the, ban, many, argue, it, reflects, the, will, of, the, european, people, better, as, it, is, the, only, directly, elected, european, body, the, arms, embargo, has, limited, china, s, options, in, seeking, military, hardware, among, the, sources, that, were, sought,
