maritime, southeast, asia, or, insular, southeast, asia, mainland, southeast, asia, comprises, cambodia, laos, myanmar, or, burma, peninsular, malaysia, thailand, and, vietnam, whereas, maritime, southeast, asia, comprises, brunei, cocos, keeling, islands, christmas, island, east, malaysia, east, timor, indonesia, philippines, and, singapore, the, earliest, homo, sapiens, presence, in, mainland, southeast, asia, can, be, traced, back, to, 70, 000, years, ago, and, to, at, least, 50, 000, years, ago, in, maritime, southeast, asia, since, 25, 000, years, ago, east, asian, related, basal, east, asian, groups, expanded, southwards, into, maritime, southeast, asia, from, mainland, southeast, asia, as, early, as, 10, 000, years, ago, hoabinhian, settlers, from, mainland, southeast, asia, had, developed, a, tradition, and, culture, of, distinct, artefact, and, tool, production, during, the, neolithic, austroasiatic, peoples, populated, indochina, via, land, routes, and, sea, borne, austronesian, immigrants, preferably, settled, in, maritime, southeast, asia, the, earliest, agricultural, societies, that, cultivated, millet, and, wet, rice, emerged, around, 1700, bce, in, the, lowlands, and, river, floodplains, of, indochina, the, phung, nguyen, culture, modern, northern, vietnam, and, the, ban, chiang, site, modern, thailand, account, for, the, earliest, use, of, copper, by, around, 2, 000, bce, followed, by, the, dong, son, culture, which, by, around, 500, bce, had, developed, a, highly, sophisticated, industry, of, bronze, production, and, processing, around, the, same, time, the, first, agrarian, kingdoms, emerged, where, territory, was, abundant, and, favourable, such, as, funan, at, the, lower, mekong, and, van, lang, in, the, red, river, delta, smaller, and, insular, principalities, increasingly, engaged, in, and, contributed, to, the, rapidly, expanding, sea, trade, the, wide, topographical, diversity, of, southeast, asia, has, greatly, influenced, its, history, for, instance, mainland, southeast, asia, with, its, continuous, but, rugged, and, difficult, terrain, provided, the, basis, for, the, early, cham, khmer, and, mon, civilizations, the, sub, region, s, extensive, coastline, and, major, river, systems, of, the, irrawaddy, salween, chao, phraya, mekong, and, red, river, have, directed, socio, cultural, and, economic, activities, towards, the, indian, ocean, and, south, china, sea, in, maritime, southeast, asia, apart, from, exceptions, such, as, borneo, and, sumatra, the, patchwork, of, recurring, land, sea, patterns, on, widely, dispersed, islands, and, archipelagos, admitted, moderately, sized, thalassocratic, states, indifferent, to, territorial, ambitions, where, growth, and, prosperity, were, associated, with, sea, trade, since, around, 100, bce, maritime, southeast, asia, has, occupied, a, central, position, at, the, crossroads, of, the, indian, ocean, and, the, south, china, sea, trading, routes, immensely, stimulating, its, economy, and, influencing, its, culture, and, society, most, local, trading, polities, selectively, adopted, indian, hindu, elements, of, statecraft, religion, culture, and, administration, during, the, early, centuries, of, the, common, era, which, marked, the, beginning, of, recorded, history, in, the, area, and, the, continuation, of, a, characteristic, cultural, development, chinese, culture, diffused, into, the, region, more, indirectly, and, sporadically, as, trade, was, mostly, based, on, land, routes, like, the, silk, road, long, periods, of, chinese, isolationism, and, political, relations, that, were, confined, to, ritualistic, tribute, procedures, prevented, deep, acculturation, buddhism, particularly, in, indochina, began, to, affect, political, structures, beginning, in, the, 8th, to, 9th, centuries, ce, islamic, ideas, arrived, in, insular, southeast, asia, as, early, as, the, 8th, century, and, the, first, muslim, societies, in, the, area, emerged, by, the, 13th, century, the, era, of, european, colonialism, early, modernity, and, the, cold, war, era, revealed, the, reality, of, limited, political, significance, for, the, various, southeast, asian, polities, post, world, war, ii, national, survival, and, progress, required, a, modern, state, and, a, strong, national, identity, most, modern, southeast, asian, countries, enjoy, a, historically, unprecedented, degree, of, political, freedom, and, self, determination, and, have, embraced, the, practical, concept, of, intergovernmental, co, operation, within, the, association, of, southeast, asian, nations, asean, though, there, are, numerous, ancient, historic, asian, designations, for, southeast, asia, none, are, geographically, consistent, with, each, other, names, referring, to, southeast, asia, include, suvarnabhumi, or, sovannah, phoum, golden, land, and, suvarnadvipa, golden, islands, in, indian, tradition, the, lands,

homo, erectus, from, approximately, 1, 500, 000, years, ago, during, the, middle, pleistocene, age, data, analysis, of, stone, tool, assemblages, and, fossil, discoveries, from, indonesia, southern, china, the, philippines, sri, lanka, and, more, recently, cambodia, and, malaysia, has, established, homo, erectus, migration, routes, and, episodes, of, presence, as, early, as, 120, 000, years, ago, with, even, older, isolated, finds, dating, back, to, 1, 8, million, years, ago, java, man, homo, erectus, erectus, and, homo, floresiensis, attest, to, a, sustained, regional, presence, and, isolation, long, enough, for, notable, diversification, of, the, species, specifics, rock, art, parietal, art, dating, from, 40, 000, years, ago, which, is, currently, the, world, s, oldest, has, been, discovered, in, the, caves, of, borneo, homo, floresiensis, also, lived, in, the, area, up, until, at, least, 50, 000, years, ago, after, which, they, became, extinct, distinct, homo, sapiens, groups, ancestral, to, east, eurasian, east, asian, related, populations, and, south, eurasian, papuan, related, populations, reached, the, region, by, 50, 000, bce, to, 70, 000, bce, with, some, arguing, earlier, these, immigrants, might, have, to, some, extent, merged, and, reproduced, with, members, of, the, archaic, population, of, homo, erectus, as, the, fossil, discoveries, in, the, tam, pa, ling, cave, suggest, during, much, of, this, time, the, present, day, islands, of, western, indonesia, were, joined, into, a, single, landmass, known, as, sundaland, due, to, lower, sea, levels, ancient, remains, of, hunter, gatherers, in, maritime, southeast, asia, such, as, one, holocene, hunter, gatherer, from, cave, of, leang, panninge, in, south, sulawesi, had, ancestry, from, both, the, south, eurasian, lineage, represented, by, papuans, and, aboriginal, australians, and, the, east, eurasian, lineage, represented, by, east, asians, the, hunter, gatherer, individual, had, approximately, 50, basal, east, asian, ancestry, and, was, positioned, in, between, modern, east, asians, and, papuans, of, oceania, the, authors, writing, about, the, individual, concluded, that, east, asian, related, ancestry, expanded, from, mainland, southeast, asia, into, maritime, southeast, asia, much, earlier, than, previously, suggested, as, early, as, 25, 000, bce, long, before, the, expansion, of, austroasiatic, and, austronesian, groups, distinctive, basal, east, asian, east, eurasian, ancestry, was, recently, found, to, have, originated, in, mainland, southeast, asia, at, 50, 000, bce, and, expanded, through, multiple, migration, waves, southwards, and, northwards, respectively, geneflow, of, east, eurasian, ancestry, into, maritime, southeast, asia, and, oceania, is, estimated, to, 25, 000, bce, possibly, as, early, as, 50, 000, bce, the, pre, neolithic, south, eurasian, populations, of, maritime, southeast, asia, were, largely, replaced, by, the, expansion, of, various, east, eurasian, populations, beginning, about, 25, 000, bce, from, mainland, southeast, asia, southeast, asia, was, dominated, by, east, asian, related, ancestry, already, in, 15, 000, bce, predating, the, expansion, of, austroasiatic, and, austronesian, peoples, ocean, drops, of, up, to, 120, m, 393, 70, ft, below, the, present, level, during, pleistocene, glacial, periods, revealed, the, vast, lowlands, known, as, sundaland, enabling, hunter, gatherer, populations, to, freely, access, insular, southeast, asia, via, extensive, terrestrial, corridors, modern, human, presence, in, the, niah, cave, on, east, malaysia, dates, back, to, 40, 000, years, bp, although, archaeological, documentation, of, the, early, settlement, period, suggests, only, brief, occupation, phases, however, author, charles, higham, argues, that, despite, glacial, periods, modern, humans, were, able, to, cross, the, sea, barrier, beyond, java, and, timor, who, around, 45, 000, years, ago, left, traces, in, the, ivane, valley, in, eastern, new, guinea, at, an, altitude, of, 2, 000, m, 6, 561, 68, ft, exploiting, yams, and, pandanus, hunting, and, making, stone, tools, between, 43, 000, and, 49, 000, years, ago, the, oldest, habitation, discovered, in, the, philippines, is, located, at, the, tabon, caves, and, dates, back, to, approximately, 50, 000, years, bp, items, found, there, such, as, burial, jars, earthenware, jade, ornaments, and, other, jewellery, stone, tools, animal, bones, and, human, fossils, date, back, to, 47, 000, years, bp, unearthed, human, remains, are, approximately, 24, 000, years, old, signs, of, an, early, tradition, are, discernible, in, the, hoabinhian, the, name, given, to, an, industry, and, cultural, continuity, of, stone, tools, and, flaked, cobble, artefacts, that, appear, around, 10, 000, bp, in, caves, and, rock, shelters, first, described, in, h, a, b, nh, vietnam, and, later, documented, in, terengganu, malaysia, sumatra, thailand, laos, myanmar, cambodia, and, yunnan, southern, china, research, emphasises, considerable, variations, in, quality, and, nature, of, the, artefacts, influenced, by, region, specific, environmental, conditions, and, proximity, and, access, to, local, resources, the, hoabinhian, culture, accounts, for, the, first, verified, ritual, burials, in, southeast, asia, the, neolithic, was, characterized, by, several, migrations, into, mainland, and, island, southeast, asia, from, southern, china, by, austronesian, austroasiatic, kra, dai, and, hmong, mien, speakers, the, most, widespread, migration, event, was, the, austronesian, expansion, which, began, around, 5, 500, bp, 3, 500, bce, from, taiwan, and, coastal, southern, china, due, to, their, early, invention, of, ocean, going, outrigger, boats, and, voyaging, catamarans, austronesians, rapidly, colonized, island, southeast, asia, before, spreading, further, into, micronesia, melanesia, polynesia, madagascar, and, the, comoros, they, dominated, the, lowlands, and, coasts, of, island, southeast, asia, intermarrying, with, the, indigenous, negrito, and, papuan, peoples, to, varying, degrees, giving, rise, to, modern, islander, southeast, asians, micronesians, polynesians, melanesians, and, malagasy, the, austroasiatic, migration, wave, involved, the, mon, and, khmer, peoples, and, migrated, to, the, broad, riverine, floodplains, of, burma, indochina, and, malaysia, territorial, principalities, in, both, insular, and, mainland, southeast, asia, characterised, as, agrarian, kingdoms, developed, an, economy, by, around, 500, bce, based, on, surplus, crop, cultivation, and, moderate, coastal, trade, of, domestic, natural, products, several, states, of, the, malayan, indonesian, thalassian, zone, shared, these, characteristics, with, indochinese, polities, like, the, pyu, city, states, in, the, irrawaddy, river, valley, the, v, n, lang, kingdom, in, the, red, river, delta, and, funan, around, the, lower, mekong, v, n, lang, founded, in, the, 7th, century, bce, endured, until, 258, bce, under, the, h, ng, b, ng, dynasty, as, part, of, the, ng, s, n, culture, that, sustained, a, dense, and, organised, population, that, produced, an, elaborate, bronze, age, industry, intensive, wet, rice, cultivation, in, an, ideal, climate, enabled, the, farming, communities, to, produce, a, regular, crop, surplus, that, was, used, by, the, ruling, elite, to, raise, command, and, pay, work, forces, for, public, construction, and, maintenance, projects, such, as, canals, and, fortifications, though, millet, and, rice, cultivation, was, introduced, around, 2000, bce, hunting, and, gathering, remained, an, important, aspect, of, food, provision, in, particular, in, forested, and, mountainous, inland, areas, many, tribal, communities, of, the, aboriginal, australo, melanesian, settlers, continued, a, lifestyle, of, mixed, sustenance, until, the, modern, era, many, areas, in, southeast, asia, participated, in, the, maritime, jade, road, a, diverse, sea, based, trade, network, which, functioned, for, 3, 000, years, mostly, in, southeast, asia, between, 2000, bce, to, 1000, ce, the, earliest, known, evidence, of, copper, and, bronze, production, in, southeast, asia, was, found, at, ban, chiang, in, north, east, thailand, and, among, the, ph, ng, nguy, n, culture, of, northern, vietnam, around, 2000, bce, the, ng, s, n, culture, established, a, tradition, of, bronze, production, and, the, manufacture, of, evermore, refined, bronze, and, iron, objects, such, as, plows, axes, and, sickles, with, shaft, holes, socketed, arrows, and, spearheads, and, small, ornamented, items, by, about, 500, bce, large, and, delicately, decorated, bronze, drums, of, remarkable, quality, weighing, more, than, 70, kg, 150, lb, were, produced, in, the, laborious, lost, wax, casting, process, this, industry, of, highly, sophisticated, metal, processing, was, developed, independent, of, chinese, or, indian, influence, historians, relate, these, achievements, to, the, presence, of, organized, centralized, and, hierarchical, communities, and, a, large, population, between, 1000, bce, and, 100, ce, the, sa, hu, nh, culture, flourished, along, the, south, central, coast, of, vietnam, ceramic, jar, burial, sites, that, included, grave, goods, have, been, discovered, at, various, sites, along, the, entire, territory, among, large, thin, walled, terracotta, jars, ornamented, and, colorized, cooking, pots, glass, items, jade, earrings, and, metal, objects, were, deposited, near, the, rivers, and, along, the, coast, the, buni, culture, is, the, name, given, to, another, early, independent, centre, of, refined, pottery, production, that, has, been, well, documented, on, the, basis, of, excavated, burial, gifts, deposited, between, 400, bce, and, 100, ce, in, coastal, north, western, java, the, objects, and, artifacts, of, the, buni, tradition, are, known, for, their, originality, and, remarkable, quality, of, incised, and, geometric, decors, its, resemblance, to, the, sa, hu, nh, culture, and, the, fact, that, it, represents, the, earliest, indian, rouletted, ware, recorded, in, southeast, asia, are, subjects, of, ongoing, research, the, first, true, maritime, trade, network, in, the, indian, ocean, was, the, austronesian, maritime, trade, network, initiated, by, the, austronesian, peoples, of, island, southeast, asia, they, established, trade, routes, with, southern, india, and, sri, lanka, as, early, as, 1500, bce, exchanging, material, culture, like, catamarans, outrigger, boats, sewn, plank, boats, and, paan, and, cultigens, like, coconuts, sandalwood, bananas, and, sugarcane, the, trade, network, also, connected, the, material, cultures, of, india, and, china, as, well, as, constituting, the, majority, of, the, indian, ocean, component, of, the, spice, trade, indonesians, in, particular, were, trading, in, spices, mainly, cinnamon, and, cassia, with, east, africa, using, catamarans, and, outrigger, boats, and, sailing, with, the, help, of, the, westerlies, in, the, indian, ocean, this, trade, network, expanded, to, reach, as, far, as, africa, and, the, arabian, peninsula, resulting, in, the, austronesian, colonization, of, madagascar, by, 500, ce, it, continued, through, historic, times, later, becoming, the, maritime, silk, road, this, trade, network, also, included, smaller, trade, routes, within, island, southeast, asia, including, the, lingling, o, jade, and, trepanging, networks, in, eastern, austronesia, various, traditional, maritime, trade, networks, also, existed, among, them, were, the, ancient, lapita, trade, network, of, island, melanesia, the, hiri, trade, cycle, sepik, coast, exchange, and, kula, ring, of, papua, new, guinea, the, ancient, trading, voyages, in, micronesia, between, the, mariana, islands, and, the, caroline, islands, and, possibly, also, new, guinea, and, the, philippines, and, the, vast, inter, island, trade, networks, of, polynesia, by, around, 500, bce, asia, s, expanding, land, and, maritime, trade, led, to, socio, economic, and, cultural, stimulation, and, diffusion, of, mainly, hindu, beliefs, into, the, regional, cosmology, of, southeast, asia, iron, age, trade, expansion, also, caused, regional, geostrategic, remodelling, southeast, asia, was, now, situated, at, the, convergence, of, the, indian, and, the, east, asian, maritime, trade, routes, a, basis, for, economic, and, cultural, growth, the, concept, of, indianised, kingdoms, a, term, coined, by, french, scholar, george, c, d, s, describes, how, southeast, asian, principalities, incorporated, central, aspects, of, indian, institutions, religion, statecraft, administration, culture, epigraphy, writing, and, architecture, the, earliest, hindu, kingdoms, emerged, in, sumatra, and, java, followed, by, mainland, polities, such, as, funan, and, champa, selective, adoption, of, indian, sociocultural, elements, stimulated, the, emergence, of, centralised, states, and, development, of, highly, organised, societies, local, leaders, began, to, adopt, hindu, worship, into, state, religion, using, the, hindu, concept, of, devar, ja, to, reinforce, divine, rule, as, opposed, to, the, chinese, concept, of, mandate, of, heaven, the, exact, nature, process, and, extent, of, indian, influence, upon, the, civilizations, of, the, region, is, still, fiercely, debated, by, contemporary, scholars, one, such, debate, is, over, the, extent, to, which, indian, merchants, brahmins, nobles, or, southeast, asian, mariner, merchants, played, central, roles, in, bringing, indian, conceptions, to, southeast, asia, additionally, the, depth, of, the, influence, of, indian, traditions, is, still, contested, whereas, early, 20th, century, scholars, emphasized, the, thorough, indianization, of, southeast, asia, more, recent, authors, have, argued, that, indian, influence, was, much, more, limited, affecting, only, a, small, section, of, the, elite, maritime, trade, from, china, to, india, passed, champa, and, funan, at, the, mekong, delta, proceeded, along, the, coast, to, the, isthmus, of, kra, portaged, across, the, narrow, and, transhipped, for, distribution, in, india, this, trading, link, boosted, the, development, of, funan, its, successor, chenla, and, the, malayan, states, of, langkasuka, on, the, eastern, coast, and, kedah, on, the, western, numerous, coastal, communities, in, maritime, southeast, asia, adopted, hindu, and, buddhist, cultural, and, religious, elements, from, india, and, developed, complex, polities, ruled, by, native, dynasties, early, hindu, kingdoms, in, indonesia, include, the, 4th, century, kutai, that, rose, in, east, kalimantan, tarumanagara, in, west, java, and, kalingga, in, central, java, the, earliest, attested, trading, contacts, in, southeast, asia, were, with, the, chinese, shang, dynasty, c, 1600, 1046, bce, when, cowry, shells, served, as, currency, during, the, zhou, dynasty, 1050, 771, bce, various, natural, products, such, as, ivory, rhinoceros, horn, tortoise, shells, pearls, and, birds, feathers, found, their, way, to, luoyang, the, zhou, capital, although, current, knowledge, about, port, localities, and, shipping, lanes, is, very, limited, it, is, assumed, that, most, of, this, exchange, took, place, on, land, routes, and, only, a, small, percentage, was, shipped, on, coastal, vessels, crewed, by, malay, and, yue, traders, military, conquests, during, the, han, dynasty, 202, bce, 220, ce, brought, a, number, of, foreign, peoples, within, the, chinese, empire, when, the, imperial, chinese, tributary, system, began, to, evolve, under, han, rule, this, tributary, system, was, based, on, the, chinese, worldview, that, had, developed, under, the, shang, dynasty, in, which, china, was, deemed, the, center, and, apogee, of, culture, and, civilization, the, middle, kingdom, mandarin, zh, nggu, surrounded, by, several, layers, of, increasingly, barbarous, peoples, contact, with, southeast, asia, steadily, increased, by, the, end, of, the, han,

and, all, the, way, to, egypt, and, europe, despite, its, association, with, china, in, recent, centuries, the, maritime, silk, road, was, primarily, established, and, operated, by, austronesian, sailors, in, southeast, asia, and, by, persian, and, arab, traders, in, the, arabian, sea, the, maritime, silk, road, developed, from, the, earlier, austronesian, spice, trade, networks, of, islander,

and, bangka, the, malay, peninsula, and, the, mekong, delta, although, chinese, records, misidentified, these, kingdoms, as, being, indian, due, to, the, indianization, of, these, regions, prior, to, the, 10th, century, the, route, was, primarily, used, by, southeast, asian, traders, although, tamil, and, persian, traders, also, sailed, them, the, route, was, influential, in, the, early, spread, of, hinduism, and, buddhism, to, the, east, china, later, built, its, own, fleets, starting, from, the, song, dynasty, in, the, 10th, century, participating, directly, in, the, trade, route, up,

greatly, enhance, the, legitimacy, of, their, reign, as, devar, ja, historians, increasingly, argue, that, the, process, of, hindu, religious, diffusion, in, the, region, must, be, attributed, to, the, initiative, of, the, local, chieftains, buddhist, teachings, which, almost, simultaneously, arrived, in, southeast, asia, developed, during, the, subsequent, centuries, gaining, more, appeal, among, the, general, population, in, the, 3rd, century, bce, the, buddhist, indian, emperor, ashoka, initiated, missionary, efforts, to, send, trained, monks, and, missionaries, abroad, to,

of, how, islam, was, introduced, into, southeast, asia, historians, have, elaborated, various, routes, from, arabia, to, india, and, then, from, india, to, southeast, asia, of, these, two, seem, to, take, prominence, either, arabian, traders, and, scholars, who, did, not, live, or, settle, in, india, spread, islam, directly, to, maritime, southeast, asia, or, arab, traders, that, had, been, settling, in, coastal, india, and, sri, lanka, for, generations, did, muslim, traders, from, india, gujarat, and, converts, of, south, asian, descent, are, variously, considered, to, play, a, major, role, a, number, of, sources, propose, the, south, china, sea, as, another, route, of, islamic, introduction, to, southeast, asia, arguments, for, this, hypothesis, include, the, following, in, 2013, the, european, union, published, the, european, commission, forum, which, maintains, an, inclusive, attitude, on, the, matter, islam, spread, in, southeast, asia, via, muslims, of, diverse, ethnic, and, cultural, origins, from, middle, easterners, arabs, and, persians, to, indians, and, even, chinese, all, of, whom, followed, the, great, commercial, routes, of, the, epoch, unlike, in, other, islamic, regions, islam, developed, in, southeast, asia, in, a, distinctly, syncretic, manner, that, allowed, the, continuation, and, inclusion, of, elements, and, ritual, practices, of, hinduism, buddhism, and, ancient, pan, east, asian, animism, most, principalities, developed, highly, distinctive, cultures, as, a, result, of, centuries, of, active, participation, in, cultural, exchange, situated, at, the, cross, roads, of, the, maritime, silk, road, coming, from, across, the, indian, ocean, in, the, west, and, the, south, china, sea, in, the, east, cultural, and, institutional, adoption, was, a, creative, and, selective, process, in, which, foreign, elements, were, incorporated, into, a, local, synthesis, unlike, some, other, islamised, regions, like, north, africa, iberia, the, middle, east, and, later, northern, india, islamic, faith, in, southeast, asia, was, not, enforced, in, the, wake, of, territorial, conquests, but, because, of, trade, routes, in, this, way, the, islamisation, of, southeast, asia, is, more, akin, to, that, of, turkic, central, asia, sub, saharan, africa, southern, india, and, northwest, china, there, are, various, records, of, lay, muslim, missionaries, scholars, and, mystics, particularly, sufis, who, were, active, in, peacefully, proselytizing, in, southeast, asia, java, for, example, received, islam, by, nine, men, referred, to, as, the, wali, sanga, or, nine, saints, although, the, historical, identity, of, such, people, is, almost, impossible, to, determine, the, foundation, of, the, first, islamic, kingdom, in, sumatra, the,

asia, in, particular, the, strait, of, malacca, marked, a, religious, turning, point, with, the, conversion, of, the, strait, into, an, islamic, water, with, the, fall, of, srivijaya, the, way, was, open, for, effective, and, widespread, proselytization, and, the, establishment, of, muslim, trading, centers, many, modern, malays, view, the, sultanate, of, malacca, which, existed, from, the, 15th, to, the, early, 16th, century, as, the, first, political, entity, of, contemporary, malaysia, the, idea, of, equality, before, god, for, the, ummah, the, people, of, god, and, a, personal, religious, effort, through, regular, prayer, in, islam, could, have, been, more, appealing, than, a, perceived, fatalism, in, hinduism, at, the, time, however, islam, also, taught, obedience, and, submission, which, could, have, helped, guarantee, that, the, social, structure, of, a, converted, people, or, political, entity, saw, less, fundamental, changes, islam, and, its, notion, of, exclusivity, and, finality, is, seemingly, incompatible, with, other, religions, including, the, chinese, concept, of, heavenly, harmony, and, the, son, of, heaven, as, its, enforcer, the, integration, of, the,
