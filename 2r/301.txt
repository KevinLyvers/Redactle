the, holy, roman, empire, also, known, as, the, holy, roman, empire, of, the, german, nation, after, 1512, was, a, polity, in, central, and, western, europe, usually, headed, by, the, holy, roman, emperor, it, developed, in, the, early, middle, ages, and, lasted, for, almost, a, thousand, years, until, its, dissolution, in, 1806, during, the, napoleonic, wars, on, 25, december, 800, pope, leo, iii, crowned, frankish, king, charlemagne, as, roman, emperor, reviving, the, title, in, western, europe, more, than, three, centuries, after, the, fall, of, the, ancient, western, roman, empire, in, 476, the, title, lapsed, in, 924, but, was, revived, in, 962, when, otto, i, was, crowned, emperor, by, pope, john, xii, fashioning, himself, as, charlemagne, s, and, the, carolingian, empire, s, successor, and, beginning, a, continuous, existence, of, the, empire, for, over, eight, centuries, from, 962, until, the, 12th, century, the, empire, was, one, of, the, most, powerful, monarchies, in, europe, the, functioning, of, government, depended, on, the, harmonious, cooperation, between, emperor, and, vassals, this, harmony, was, disturbed, during, the, salian, period, the, empire, reached, the, apex, of, territorial, expansion, and, power, under, the, house, of, hohenstaufen, in, the, mid, 13th, century, but, overextension, of, its, power, led, to, a, partial, collapse, scholars, generally, describe, an, evolution, of, the, institutions, and, principles, constituting, the, empire, and, a, gradual, development, of, the, imperial, role, while, the, office, of, emperor, had, been, reestablished, the, exact, term, for, his, realm, as, the, holy, roman, empire, was, not, used, until, the, 13th, century, although, the, emperor, s, theoretical, legitimacy, from, the, beginning, rested, on, the, concept, of, translatio, imperii, that, he, held, supreme, power, inherited, from, the, ancient, emperors, of, rome, nevertheless, in, the, holy, roman, empire, the, imperial, office, was, traditionally, elective, by, the, mostly, german, prince, electors, in, theory, and, diplomacy, the, emperors, were, considered, the, first, among, equals, of, all, europe, s, catholic, monarchs, a, process, of, imperial, reform, in, the, late, 15th, and, early, 16th, centuries, transformed, the, empire, creating, a, set, of, institutions, which, endured, until, its, final, demise, in, the, 19th, century, according, to, historian, thomas, brady, jr, the, empire, after, the, imperial, reform, was, a, political, body, of, remarkable, longevity, and, stability, and, resembled, in, some, respects, the, monarchical, polities, of, europe, s, western, tier, and, in, others, the, loosely, integrated, elective, polities, of, east, central, europe, the, new, corporate, german, nation, instead, of, simply, obeying, the, emperor, negotiated, with, him, on, 6, august, 1806, emperor, francis, ii, abdicated, and, formally, dissolved, the, empire, following, the, creation, the, month, before, by, french, emperor, napoleon, of, the, confederation, of, the, rhine, a, confederation, of, german, client, states, loyal, not, to, the, holy, roman, emperor, but, to, france, since, charlemagne, the, realm, was, merely, referred, to, as, the, roman, empire, the, term, sacrum, holy, in, the, sense, of, consecrated, in, connection, with, the, medieval, roman, empire, was, used, beginning, in, 1157, under, frederick, i, barbarossa, holy, empire, the, term, was, added, to, reflect, frederick, s, ambition, to, dominate, italy, and, the, papacy, the, form, holy, roman, empire, is, attested, from, 1254, onward, the, exact, term, holy, roman, empire, was, not, used, until, the, 13th, century, before, which, the, empire, was, referred, to, variously, as, universum, regnum, the, whole, kingdom, as, opposed, to, the, regional, kingdoms, imperium, christianum, christian, empire, or, romanum, imperium, roman, empire, but, the, emperor, s, legitimacy, always, rested, on, the, concept, of, translatio, imperii, that, he, held, supreme, power, inherited, from, the, ancient, emperors, of, rome, in, a, decree, following, the, diet, of, cologne, in, 1512, the, name, was, changed, to, the, holy, roman, empire, of, the, germanic, nation, german, heiliges, r, misches, reich, deutscher, nation, latin, sacrum, imperium, romanum, nationis, germanicae, a, form, first, used, in, a, document, in, 1474, the, adoption, of, this, new, name, coincided, with, the, loss, of, imperial, territories, in, italy, and, burgundy, to, the, south, and, west, by, the, late, 15th, century, but, also, to, emphasize, the, new, importance, of, the, german, imperial, estates, in, ruling, the, empire, due, to, the, imperial, reform, the, hungarian, denomination, german, roman, empire, hungarian, n, met, r, mai, birodalom, is, the, shortening, of, this, by, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, the, term, holy, roman, empire, of, the, german, nation, fell, out, of, official, use, contradicting, the, traditional, view, concerning, that, designation, hermann, weisert, has, argued, in, a, study, on, imperial, titulature, that, despite, the, claims, of, many, textbooks, the, name, holy, roman, empire, of, the, german, nation, never, had, an, official, status, and, points, out, that, documents, were, thirty, times, as, likely, to, omit, the, national, suffix, as, include, it, in, a, famous, assessment, of, the, name, the, political, philosopher, voltaire, remarked, sardonically, this, body, which, was, called, and, which, still, calls, itself, the, holy, roman, empire, was, in, no, way, holy, nor, roman, nor, an, empire, in, the, modern, period, the, empire, was, often, informally, called, the, german, empire, deutsches, reich, or, roman, german, empire, r, misch, deutsches, reich, after, its, dissolution, through, the, end, of, the, german, empire, it, was, often, called, the, old, empire, das, alte, reich, beginning, in, 1923, early, twentieth, century, german, nationalists, and, nazi, party, propaganda, would, identify, the, holy, roman, empire, as, the, first, reich, erstes, reich, reich, meaning, empire, with, the, german, empire, as, the, second, reich, and, what, would, eventually, become, nazi, germany, as, the, third, reich, david, s, bachrach, opines, that, the, ottonian, kings, actually, built, their, empire, on, the, back, of, military, and, bureaucratic, apparatuses, as, well, as, the, cultural, legacy, they, inherited, from, the, carolingians, who, ultimately, inherited, these, from, the, late, roman, empire, he, argues, that, the, ottonian, empire, was, hardly, an, archaic, kingdom, of, primitive, germans, maintained, by, personal, relationships, only, and, driven, by, the, desire, of, the, magnates, to, plunder, and, divide, the, rewards, among, themselves, but, instead, notable, for, their, abilities, to, amass, sophisticated, economic, administrative, educational, and, cultural, resources, that, they, used, to, serve, their, enormous, war, machine, until, the, end, of, the, 15th, century, the, empire, was, in, theory, composed, of, three, major, blocs, italy, germany, and, burgundy, later, territorially, only, the, kingdom, of, germany, and, bohemia, remained, with, the, burgundian, territories, lost, to, france, although, the, italian, territories, were, formally, part, of, the, empire, the, territories, were, ignored, in, the, imperial, reform, and, splintered, into, numerous, de, facto, independent, territorial, entities, the, status, of, italy, in, particular, varied, throughout, the, 16th, to, 18th, centuries, some, territories, like, piedmont, savoy, became, increasingly, independent, while, others, became, more, dependent, due, to, the, extinction, of, their, ruling, noble, houses, causing, these, territories, to, often, fall, under, the, dominions, of, the, habsburgs, and, their, cadet, branches, barring, the, loss, of, franche, comt, in, 1678, the, external, borders, of, the, empire, did, not, change, noticeably, from, the, peace, of, westphalia, which, acknowledged, the, exclusion, of, switzerland, and, the, northern, netherlands, and, the, french, protectorate, over, alsace, to, the, dissolution, of, the, empire, at, the, conclusion, of, the, napoleonic, wars, in, 1815, most, of, the, holy, roman, empire, was, included, in, the, german, confederation, with, the, main, exceptions, being, the, italian, states, as, roman, power, in, gaul, declined, during, the, 5th, century, local, germanic, tribes, assumed, control, in, the, late, 5th, and, early, 6th, centuries, the, merovingians, under, clovis, i, and, his, successors, consolidated, frankish, tribes, and, extended, hegemony, over, others, to, gain, control, of, northern, gaul, and, the, middle, rhine, river, valley, region, by, the, middle, of, the, 8th, century, the, merovingians, were, reduced, to, figureheads, and, the, carolingians, led, by, charles, martel, became, the, de, facto, rulers, in, 751, martel, s, son, pepin, became, king, of, the, franks, and, later, gained, the, sanction, of, the, pope, the, carolingians, would, maintain, a, close, alliance, with, the, papacy, in, 768, pepin, s, son, charlemagne, became, king, of, the, franks, and, began, an, extensive, expansion, of, the, realm, he, eventually, incorporated, the, territories, of, present, day, france, germany, northern, italy, the, low, countries, and, beyond, linking, the, frankish, kingdom, with, papal, lands, although, antagonism, about, the, expense, of, byzantine, domination, had, long, persisted, within, italy, a, political, rupture, was, set, in, motion, in, earnest, in, 726, by, the, iconoclasm, of, emperor, leo, iii, the, isaurian, in, what, pope, gregory, ii, saw, as, the, latest, in, a, series, of, imperial, heresies, in, 797, the, eastern, roman, emperor, constantine, vi, was, removed, from, the, throne, by, his, mother, empress, irene, who, declared, herself, sole, ruler, as, the, latin, church, only, regarded, a, male, roman, emperor, as, the, head, of, christendom, pope, leo, iii, sought, a, new, candidate, for, the, dignity, excluding, consultation, with, the, patriarch, of, constantinople, charlemagne, s, good, service, to, the, church, in, his, defense, of, papal, possessions, against, the, lombards, made, him, the, ideal, candidate, on, christmas, day, of, 800, pope, leo, iii, crowned, charlemagne, emperor, restoring, the, title, in, the, west, for, the, first, time, in, over, three, centuries, this, can, be, seen, as, symbolic, of, the, papacy, turning, away, from, the, declining, byzantine, empire, toward, the, new, power, of, carolingian, francia, charlemagne, adopted, the, formula, renovatio, imperii, romanorum, renewal, of, the, roman, empire, in, 802, irene, was, overthrown, and, exiled, by, nikephoros, i, and, henceforth, there, were, two, roman, emperors, after, charlemagne, died, in, 814, the, imperial, crown, passed, to, his, son, louis, the, pious, upon, louis, death, in, 840, it, passed, to, his, son, lothair, who, had, been, his, co, ruler, by, this, point, the, territory, of, charlemagne, was, divided, into, several, territories, cf, treaty, of, verdun, treaty, of, pr, m, treaty, of, meerssen, and, treaty, of, ribemont, and, over, the, course, of, the, later, 9th, century, the, title, of, emperor, was, disputed, by, the, carolingian, rulers, of, the, western, frankish, kingdom, or, west, francia, and, the, eastern, frankish, kingdom, or, east, francia, with, first, the, western, king, charles, the, bald, and, then, the, eastern, charles, the, fat, who, briefly, reunited, the, empire, attaining, the, prize, in, the, 9th, century, charlemagne, and, his, successors, promoted, the, intellectual, revival, known, as, the, carolingian, renaissance, some, like, mortimer, chambers, opine, that, the, carolingian, renaissance, made, possible, the, subsequent, renaissances, even, though, by, the, early, 10th, century, the, revival, already, diminished, after, the, death, of, charles, the, fat, in, 888, the, carolingian, empire, broke, apart, and, was, never, restored, according, to, regino, of, pr, m, the, parts, of, the, realm, spewed, forth, kinglets, and, each, part, elected, a, kinglet, from, its, own, bowels, the, last, such, emperor, was, berengar, i, of, italy, who, died, in, 924, around, 900, east, francia, s, autonomous, stem, duchies, franconia, bavaria, swabia, saxony, and, lotharingia, reemerged, after, the, carolingian, king, louis, the, child, died, without, issue, in, 911, east, francia, did, not, turn, to, the, carolingian, ruler, of, west, francia, to, take, over, the, realm, but, instead, elected, one, of, the, dukes, conrad, of, franconia, as, rex, francorum, orientalium, on, his, deathbed, conrad, yielded, the, crown, to, his, main, rival, henry, the, fowler, of, saxony, r, 919, 936, who, was, elected, king, at, the, diet, of, fritzlar, in, 919, henry, reached, a, truce, with, the, raiding, magyars, and, in, 933, he, won, a, first, victory, against, them, in, the, battle, of, riade, henry, died, in, 936, but, his, descendants, the, liudolfing, or, ottonian, dynasty, would, continue, to, rule, the, eastern, kingdom, or, the, kingdom, of, germany, for, roughly, a, century, upon, henry, the, fowler, s, death, otto, his, son, and, designated, successor, was, elected, king, in, aachen, in, 936, he, overcame, a, series, of, revolts, from, a, younger, brother, and, from, several, dukes, after, that, the, king, managed, to, control, the, appointment, of, dukes, and, often, also, employed, bishops, in, administrative, affairs, he, replaced, leaders, of, most, of, the, major, east, frankish, duchies, with, his, own, relatives, at, the, same, time, he, was, careful, to, prevent, members, of, his, own, family, from, making, infringements, on, his, royal, prerogatives, in, 951, otto, came, to, the, aid, of, queen, adelaide, of, italy, defeating, her, enemies, marrying, her, and, taking, control, over, italy, in, 955, otto, won, a, decisive, victory, over, the, magyars, in, the, battle, of, lechfeld, in, 962, otto, was, crowned, emperor, by, pope, john, xii, thus, intertwining, the, affairs, of, the, german, kingdom, with, those, of, italy, and, the, papacy, otto, s, coronation, as, emperor, marked, the, german, kings, as, successors, to, the, empire, of, charlemagne, which, through, the, concept, of, translatio, imperii, also, made, them, consider, themselves, as, successors, to, ancient, rome, the, flowering, of, arts, beginning, with, otto, the, great, s, reign, is, known, as, the, ottonian, renaissance, centered, in, germany, but, also, happening, in, northern, italy, and, france, otto, created, the, imperial, church, system, often, called, ottonian, church, system, of, the, reich, which, tied, the, great, imperial, churches, and, their, representatives, to, imperial, service, thus, providing, a, stable, and, long, lasting, framework, for, germany, during, the, ottonian, era, imperial, women, played, a, prominent, role, in, political, and, ecclesiastic, affairs, often, combining, their, functions, as, religious, leader, and, advisor, regent, or, co, ruler, notably, matilda, of, ringelheim, eadgyth, adelaide, of, italy, theophanu, and, matilda, of, quedlinburg, in, 963, otto, deposed, john, xii, and, chose, leo, viii, as, the, new, pope, although, john, xii, and, leo, viii, both, claimed, the, papacy, until, 964, when, john, xii, died, this, also, renewed, the, conflict, with, the, byzantine, emperor, especially, after, otto, s, son, otto, ii, r, 967, 983, adopted, the, designation, imperator, romanorum, still, otto, ii, formed, marital, ties, with, the, east, when, he, married, the, byzantine, princess, theophanu, their, son, otto, iii, came, to, the, throne, only, three, years, old, and, was, subjected, to, a, power, struggle, and, series, of, regencies, until, his, age, of, majority, in, 994, up, to, that, time, he, remained, in, germany, while, a, deposed, duke, crescentius, ii, ruled, over, rome, and, part, of, italy, ostensibly, in, his, stead, in, 996, otto, iii, appointed, his, cousin, gregory, v, the, first, german, pope, a, foreign, pope, and, foreign, papal, officers, were, seen, with, suspicion, by, roman, nobles, who, were, led, by, crescentius, ii, to, revolt, otto, iii, s, former, mentor, antipope, john, xvi, briefly, held, rome, until, the, holy, roman, emperor, seized, the, city, otto, died, young, in, 1002, and, was, succeeded, by, his, cousin, henry, ii, who, focused, on, germany, otto, iii, s, and, his, mentor, pope, sylvester, s, diplomatic, activities, coincided, with, and, facilitated, the, christianization, and, the, spread, of, latin, culture, in, different, parts, of, europe, they, coopted, a, new, group, of, nations, slavic, into, the, framework, of, europe, with, their, empire, functioning, as, some, remark, as, a, byzantine, like, presidency, over, a, family, of, nations, centred, on, pope, and, emperor, in, rome, this, has, proved, a, lasting, achievement, otto, s, early, death, though, made, his, reign, the, tale, of, largely, unrealized, potential, henry, ii, died, in, 1024, and, conrad, ii, first, of, the, salian, dynasty, was, elected, king, only, after, some, debate, among, dukes, and, nobles, this, group, eventually, developed, into, the, college, of, electors, the, holy, roman, empire, eventually, came, to, be, composed, of, four, kingdoms, kings, often, employed, bishops, in, administrative, affairs, and, often, determined, who, would, be, appointed, to, ecclesiastical, offices, in, the, wake, of, the, cluniac, reforms, this, involvement, was, increasingly, seen, as, inappropriate, by, the, papacy, the, reform, minded, pope, gregory, vii, was, determined, to, oppose, such, practices, which, led, to, the, investiture, controversy, with, king, henry, iv, r, 1056, 1106, crowned, emperor, in, 1084, henry, iv, repudiated, the, pope, s, interference, and, persuaded, his, bishops, to, excommunicate, the, pope, whom, he, famously, addressed, by, his, birth, name, hildebrand, rather, than, his, papal, name, gregory, the, pope, in, turn, excommunicated, the, king, declared, him, deposed, and, dissolved, the, oaths, of, loyalty, made, to, henry, the, king, found, himself, with, almost, no, political, support, and, was, forced, to, make, the, famous, walk, to, canossa, in, 1077, by, which, he, achieved, a, lifting, of, the, excommunication, at, the, price, of, humiliation, meanwhile, the, german, princes, had, elected, another, king, rudolf, of, swabia, henry, managed, to, defeat, rudolf, but, was, subsequently, confronted, with, more, uprisings, renewed, excommunication, and, even, the, rebellion, of, his, sons, after, his, death, his, second, son, henry, v, reached, an, agreement, with, the, pope, and, the, bishops, in, the, 1122, concordat, of, worms, the, political, power, of, the, empire, was, maintained, but, the, conflict, had, demonstrated, the, limits, of, the, ruler, s, power, especially, in, regard, to, the, church, and, it, robbed, the, king, of, the, sacral, status, he, had, previously, enjoyed, the, pope, and, the, german, princes, had, surfaced, as, major, players, in, the, political, system, of, the, holy, roman, empire, as, the, result, of, ostsiedlung, less, populated, regions, of, central, europe, i, e, sparsely, populated, border, areas, in, present, day, poland, and, czechia, received, a, significant, number, of, german, speakers, silesia, became, part, of, the, holy, roman, empire, as, the, result, of, the, local, piast, dukes, push, for, autonomy, from, the, polish, crown, from, the, late, 12th, century, the, duchy, of, pomerania, was, under, the, suzerainty, of, the, holy, roman, empire, and, the, conquests, of, the, teutonic, order, made, that, region, german, speaking, when, the, salian, dynasty, ended, with, henry, v, s, death, in, 1125, the, princes, chose, not, to, elect, the, next, of, kin, but, rather, lothair, iii, the, moderately, powerful, but, already, old, duke, of, saxony, when, he, died, in, 1137, the, princes, again, aimed, to, check, royal, power, accordingly, they, did, not, elect, lothair, s, favoured, heir, his, son, in, law, henry, the, proud, of, the, welf, family, but, conrad, iii, of, the, hohenstaufen, family, the, grandson, of, emperor, henry, iv, and, nephew, of, emperor, henry, v, this, led, to, over, a, century, of, strife, between, the, two, houses, conrad, ousted, the, welfs, from, their, possessions, but, after, his, death, in, 1152, his, nephew, frederick, barbarossa, succeeded, him, and, made, peace, with, the, welfs, restoring, his, cousin, henry, the, lion, to, his, albeit, diminished, possessions, the, hohenstaufen, rulers, increasingly, lent, land, to, ministeriales, formerly, non, free, servicemen, who, frederick, hoped, would, be, more, reliable, than, dukes, initially, used, mainly, for, war, services, this, new, class, of, people, would, form, the, basis, for, the, later, knights, another, basis, of, imperial, power, a, further, important, constitutional, move, at, roncaglia, was, the, establishment, of, a, new, peace, mechanism, for, the, entire, empire, the, landfrieden, with, the, first, imperial, one, being, issued, in, 1103, under, henry, iv, at, mainz, this, was, an, attempt, to, abolish, private, feuds, between, the, many, dukes, and, other, people, and, to, tie, the, emperor, s, subordinates, to, a, legal, system, of, jurisdiction, and, public, prosecution, of, criminal, acts, a, predecessor, of, the, modern, concept, of, rule, of, law, another, new, concept, of, the, time, was, the, systematic, founding, of, new, cities, by, the, emperor, and, by, the, local, dukes, these, were, partly, a, result, of, the, explosion, in, population, they, also, concentrated, economic, power, at, strategic, locations, before, this, cities, had, only, existed, in, the, form, of, old, roman, foundations, or, older, bishoprics, cities, that, were, founded, in, the, 12th, century, include, freiburg, possibly, the, economic, model, for, many, later, cities, and, munich, frederick, barbarossa, was, crowned, emperor, in, 1155, he, emphasized, the, romanness, of, the, empire, partly, in, an, attempt, to, justify, the, power, of, the, emperor, independent, of, the, now, strengthened, pope, an, imperial, assembly, at, the, fields, of, roncaglia, in, 1158, reclaimed, imperial, rights, in, reference, to, justinian, i, s, corpus, juris, civilis, imperial, rights, had, been, referred, to, as, regalia, since, the, investiture, controversy, but, were, enumerated, for, the, first, time, at, roncaglia, this, comprehensive, list, included, public, roads, tariffs, coining, collecting, punitive, fees, and, the, seating, and, unseating, of, office, holders, these, rights, were, now, explicitly, rooted, in, roman, law, a, far, reaching, constitutional, act, frederick, s, policies, were, primarily, directed, at, italy, where, he, clashed, with, the, free, minded, cities, of, the, north, especially, the, duchy, of, milan, he, also, embroiled, himself, in, another, conflict, with, the, papacy, by, supporting, a, candidate, elected, by, a, minority, against, pope, alexander, iii, 1159, 1181, frederick, supported, a, succession, of, antipopes, before, finally, making, peace, with, alexander, in, 1177, in, germany, the, emperor, had, repeatedly, protected, henry, the, lion, against, complaints, by, rival, princes, or, cities, especially, in, the, cases, of, munich, and, l, beck, henry, gave, only, lackluster, support, to, frederick, s, policies, and, in, a, critical, situation, during, the, italian, wars, henry, refused, the, emperor, s, plea, for, military, support, after, returning, to, germany, an, embittered, frederick, opened, proceedings, against, the, duke, resulting, in, a, public, ban, and, the, confiscation, of, all, henry, s, territories, in, 1190, frederick, participated, in, the, third, crusade, dying, in, the, armenian, kingdom, of, cilicia, during, the, hohenstaufen, period, german, princes, facilitated, a, successful, peaceful, eastward, settlement, of, lands, that, were, uninhabited, or, inhabited, sparsely, by, west, slavs, german, speaking, farmers, traders, and, craftsmen, from, the, western, part, of, the, empire, both, christians, and, jews, moved, into, these, areas, the, gradual, germanization, of, these, lands, was, a, complex, phenomenon, that, should, not, be, interpreted, in, the, biased, terms, of, 19th, century, nationalism, the, eastward, settlement, expanded, the, influence, of, the, empire, to, include, pomerania, and, silesia, as, did, the, intermarriage, of, the, local, still, mostly, slavic, rulers, with, german, spouses, the, teutonic, knights, were, invited, to, prussia, by,

duchy, of, prussia, was, never, part, of, the, holy, roman, empire, under, the, son, and, successor, of, frederick, barbarossa, henry, vi, the, hohenstaufen, dynasty, reached, its, apex, with, the, addition, of, the, norman, kingdom, of, sicily, through, the, marriage, of, henry, vi, and, constance, of, sicily, bohemia, and, poland, were, under, feudal, dependence, while, cyprus, and, lesser, armenia, also, paid, homage, the, iberian, moroccan, caliph, accepted, his, claims, over, the, suzerainty, over, tunis, and, tripolitania, and, paid, tribute, fearing, the, power, of, henry, the, most, powerful, monarch, in, europe, since, charlemagne, the, other, european, kings, formed, an, alliance, but, henry, broke, this, coalition, by, blackmailing, english, king, richard, the, lionheart, the, byzantine, emperor, worried, that, henry, would, turn, his, crusade, plan, against, his, empire, and, began, to, collect, the, alamanikon, to, prepare, against, the, expected, invasion, henry, also, had, plans, for, turning, the, empire, into, a, hereditary, monarchy, although, this, met, with, opposition, from, some, of, the, princes, and, the, pope, the, emperor, suddenly, died, in, 1197, leading, to, the, partial, collapse, of, his, empire, as, his, son, frederick, ii, though, already, elected, king, was, still, a, small, child, and, living, in, sicily, german, princes, chose, to, elect, an, adult, king, resulting, in, the, dual, election, of, frederick, barbarossa, s, youngest, son, philip, of, swabia, and, henry, the, lion, s, son, otto, of, brunswick, who, competed, for, the, crown, after, philip, was, murdered, in, a, private, squabble, in, 1208, otto, prevailed, for, a, while, until, he, began, to, also, claim, sicily, pope, innocent, iii, who, feared, the, threat, posed, by, a, union, of, the, empire, and, sicily, was, now, supported, by, frederick, ii, who, marched, to, germany, and, defeated, otto, after, his, victory, frederick, did, not, act, upon, his, promise, to, keep, the, two, realms, separate, though, he, had, made, his, son, henry, king, of, sicily, before, marching, on, germany, he, still, reserved, real, political, power, for, himself, this, continued, after, frederick, was, crowned, emperor, in, 1220, fearing, frederick, s, concentration, of, power, the, pope, finally, excommunicated, him, another, point, of, contention, was, the, crusade, which, frederick, had, promised, but, repeatedly, postponed, now, although, excommunicated, frederick, led, the, sixth, crusade, in, 1228, which, ended, in, negotiations, and, a, temporary, restoration, of, the, kingdom, of, jerusalem, despite, his, imperial, claims, frederick, s, rule, was, a, major, turning, point, toward, the, disintegration, of, central, rule, in, the, empire, while, concentrating, on, establishing, a, more, centralized, state, in, sicily, he, was, mostly, absent, from, germany, and, issued, far, reaching, privileges, to, germany, s, secular, and, ecclesiastical, princes, in, the, 1220, confoederatio, cum, principibus, ecclesiasticis, frederick, gave, up, a, number, of, regalia, in, favour, of, the, bishops, among, them, tariffs, coining, and, the, right, to, build, fortification, the, 1232, statutum, in, favorem, principum, mostly, extended, these, privileges, to, secular, territories, although, many, of, these, privileges, had, existed, earlier, they, were, now, granted, globally, and, once, and, for, all, to, allow, the, german, princes, to, maintain, order, north, of, the, alps, while, frederick, concentrated, on, italy, the, 1232, document, marked, the, first, time, that, the, german, dukes, were, called, domini, terr, owners, of, their, lands, a, remarkable, change, in, terminology, as, well, the, kingdom, of, bohemia, was, a, significant, regional, power, during, the, middle, ages, in, 1212, king, ottokar, i, bearing, the, title, king, since, 1198, extracted, a, golden, bull, of, sicily, a, formal, edict, from, emperor, frederick, ii, confirming, the, royal, title, for, ottokar, and, his, descendants, and, the, duchy, of, bohemia, was, raised, to, a, kingdom, bohemia, s, political, and, financial, obligations, to, the, empire, were, gradually, reduced, charles, iv, set, prague, to, be, the, seat, of, the, holy, roman, emperor, after, the, death, of, frederick, ii, in, 1250, the, german, kingdom, was, divided, between, his, son, conrad, iv, died, 1254, and, the, anti, king, william, of, holland, died, 1256, conrad, s, death, was, followed, by, the, interregnum, during, which, no, king, could, achieve, universal, recognition, allowing, the, princes, to, consolidate, their, holdings, and, become, even, more, independent, as, rulers, after, 1257, the, crown, was, contested, between, richard, of, cornwall, who, was, supported, by, the, guelph, party, and, alfonso, x, of, castile, who, was, recognized, by, the, hohenstaufen, party, but, never, set, foot, on, german, soil, after, richard, s, death, in, 1273, rudolf, i, of, germany, a, minor, pro, hohenstaufen, count, was, elected, he, was, the, first, of, the, habsburgs, to, hold, a, royal, title, but, he, was, never, crowned, emperor, after, rudolf, s, death, in, 1291, adolf, and, albert, were, two, further, weak, kings, who, were, never, crowned, emperor, albert, was, assassinated, in, 1308, almost, immediately, king, philip, iv, of, france, began, aggressively, seeking, support, for, his, brother, charles, of, valois, to, be, elected, the, next, king, of, the, romans, philip, thought, he, had, the, backing, of, the, french, pope, clement, v, established, at, avignon, in, 1309, and, that, his, prospects, of, bringing, the, empire, into, the, orbit, of, the, french, royal, house, were, good, he, lavishly, spread, french, money, in, the, hope, of, bribing, the, german, electors, although, charles, of, valois, had, the, backing, of, pro, french, henry, archbishop, of, cologne, many, were, not, keen, to, see, an, expansion, of, french, power, least, of, all, clement, v, the, principal, rival, to, charles, appeared, to, be, count, palatine, rudolf, ii, but, the, electors, the, great, territorial, magnates, who, had, lived, without, a, crowned, emperor, for, decades, were, unhappy, with, both, charles, and, rudolf, instead, count, henry, of, luxembourg, with, the, aid, of, his, brother, archbishop, baldwin, of, trier, was, elected, as, henry, vii, with, six, votes, at, frankfurt, on, 27, november, 1308, though, a, vassal, of, king, philip, henry, was, bound, by, few, national, ties, and, thus, suitable, as, a, compromise, candidate, henry, vii, was, crowned, king, at, aachen, on, 6, january, 1309, and, emperor, by, pope, clement, v, on, 29, june, 1312, in, rome, ending, the, interregnum, during, the, 13th, century, a, general, structural, change, in, how, land, was, administered, prepared, the, shift, of, political, power, toward, the, rising, bourgeoisie, at, the, expense, of, the, aristocratic, feudalism, that, would, characterize, the, late, middle, ages, the, rise, of, the, cities, and, the, emergence, of, the, new, burgher, class, eroded, the, societal, legal, and, economic, order, of, feudalism, peasants, were, increasingly, required, to, pay, tribute, to, their, landlords, the, concept, of, property, began, to, replace, more, ancient, forms, of, jurisdiction, although, they, were, still, very, much, tied, together, in, the, territories, not, at, the, level, of, the, empire, power, became, increasingly, bundled, whoever, owned, the, land, had, jurisdiction, from, which, other, powers, derived, jurisdiction, at, the, time, did, not, include, legislation, which, was, virtually, nonexistent, until, well, into, the, 15th, century, court, practice, heavily, relied, on, traditional, customs, or, rules, described, as, customary, during, this, time, territories, began, to, transform, into, the, predecessors, of, modern, states, the, process, varied, greatly, among, the, various, lands, and, was, most, advanced, in, those, territories, that, were, almost, identical, to, the, lands, of, the, old, germanic, tribes, e, g, bavaria, it, was, slower, in, those, scattered, territories, that, were, founded, through, imperial, privileges, in, the, 12th, century, the, hanseatic, league, established, itself, as, a, commercial, and, defensive, alliance, of, the, merchant, guilds, of, towns, and, cities, in, the, empire, and, all, over, northern, and, central, europe, it, dominated, marine, trade, in, the, baltic, sea, the, north, sea, and, along, the, connected, navigable, rivers, each, of, the, affiliated, cities, retained, the, legal, system, of, its, sovereign, and, with, the, exception, of, the, free, imperial, cities, had, only, a, limited, degree, of, political, autonomy, by, the, late, 14th, century, the, powerful, league, enforced, its, interests, with, military, means, if, necessary, this, culminated, in, a, war, with, the, sovereign, kingdom, of, denmark, from, 1361, to, 1370, the, league, declined, after, 1450, the, difficulties, in, electing, the, king, eventually, led, to, the, emergence, of, a, fixed, college, of, prince, electors, kurf, rsten, whose, composition, and, procedures, were, set, forth, in, the, golden, bull, of, 1356, issued, by, charles, iv, reigned, 1355, 1378, king, of, the, romans, since, 1346, which, remained, valid, until, 1806, this, development, probably, best, symbolizes, the, emerging, duality, between, emperor, and, realm, kaiser, und, reich, which, were, no, longer, considered, identical, the, golden, bull, also, set, forth, the, system, for, election, of, the, holy, roman, emperor, the, emperor, now, was, to, be, elected, by, a, majority, rather, than, by, consent, of, all, seven, electors, for, electors, the, title, became, hereditary, and, they, were, given, the, right, to, mint, coins, and, to, exercise, jurisdiction, also, it, was, recommended, that, their, sons, learn, the, imperial, languages, german, latin, italian, and, czech, the, decision, by, charles, iv, is, the, subject, of, debates, on, one, hand, it, helped, to, restore, peace, in, the, lands, of, the, empire, that, had, been, engulfed, in, civil, conflicts, after, the, end, of, the, hohenstaufen, era, on, the, other, hand, the, blow, to, central, authority, was, unmistakable, thomas, brady, jr, opines, that, charles, iv, s, intention, was, to, end, contested, royal, elections, from, the, luxembourghs, perspective, they, also, had, the, advantage, that, the, king, of, bohemia, had, a, permanent, and, preeminent, status, as, one, of, the, electors, himself, at, the, same, time, he, built, up, bohemia, as, the, luxembourghs, core, land, of, the, empire, and, their, dynastic, base, his, reign, in, bohemia, is, often, considered, the, land, s, golden, age, according, to, brady, jr, though, under, all, the, glitter, one, problem, arose, the, government, showed, an, inability, to, deal, with, the, german, immigrant, waves, into, bohemia, thus, leading, to, religious, tensions, and, persecutions, the, imperial, project, of, the, luxembourgh, halted, under, charles, s, son, wenceslaus, reigned, 1378, 1419, as, king, of, bohemia, 1376, 1400, as, king, of, the, romans, who, also, faced, opposition, from, 150, local, baronial, families, the, shift, in, power, away, from, the, emperor, is, also, revealed, in, the, way, the, post, hohenstaufen, kings, attempted, to, sustain, their, power, earlier, the, empire, s, strength, and, finances, greatly, relied, on, the, empire, s, own, lands, the, so, called, reichsgut, which, always, belonged, to, the, king, of, the, day, and, included, many, imperial, cities, after, the, 13th, century, the, relevance, of, the, reichsgut, faded, even, though, some, parts, of, it, did, remain, until, the, empire, s, end, in, 1806, instead, the, reichsgut, was, increasingly, pawned, to, local, dukes, sometimes, to, raise, money, for, the, empire, but, more, frequently, to, reward, faithful, duty, or, as, an, attempt, to, establish, control, over, the, dukes, the, direct, governance, of, the, reichsgut, no, longer, matched, the, needs, of, either, the, king, or, the, dukes, the, kings, beginning, with, rudolf, i, of, germany, increasingly, relied, on, the, lands, of, their, respective, dynasties, to, support, their, power, in, contrast, with, the, reichsgut, which, was, mostly, scattered, and, difficult, to, administer, these, territories, were, relatively, compact, and, thus, easier, to, control, in, 1282, rudolf, i, thus, lent, austria, and, styria, to, his, own, sons, in, 1312, henry, vii, of, the, house, of, luxembourg, was, crowned, as, the, first, holy, roman, emperor, since, frederick, ii, after, him, all, kings, and, emperors, relied, on, the, lands, of, their, own, family, hausmacht, louis, iv, of, wittelsbach, king, 1314, emperor, 1328, 1347, relied, on, his, lands, in, bavaria, charles, iv, of, luxembourg, the, grandson, of, henry, vii, drew, strength, from, his, own, lands, in, bohemia, it, was, thus, increasingly, in, the, king, s, own, interest, to, strengthen, the, power, of, the, territories, since, the, king, profited, from, such, a, benefit, in, his, own, lands, as, well, the, constitution, of, the, empire, still, remained, largely, unsettled, at, the, beginning, of, the, 15th, century, feuds, often, happened, between, local, rulers, the, robber, baron, raubritter, became, a, social, factor, simultaneously, the, catholic, church, experienced, crises, of, its, own, with, wide, reaching, effects, in, the, empire, the, conflict, between, several, papal, claimants, two, anti, popes, and, the, legitimate, pope, ended, only, with, the, council, of, constance, 1414, 1418, after, 1419, the, papacy, directed, much, of, its, energy, to, suppressing, the, hussites, the, medieval, idea, of, unifying, all, christendom, into, a, single, political, entity, with, the, church, and, the, empire, as, its, leading, institutions, began, to, decline, with, these, drastic, changes, much, discussion, emerged, in, the, 15th, century, about, the, empire, itself, rules, from, the, past, no, longer, adequately, described, the, structure, of, the, time, and, a, reinforcement, of, earlier, landfrieden, was, urgently, needed, the, vision, for, a, simultaneous, reform, of, the, empire, and, the, church, on, a, central, level, began, with, sigismund, reigned, 1433, 1437, king, of, the, romans, since, 1411, who, according, to, historian, thomas, brady, jr, possessed, a, breadth, of, vision, and, a, sense, of, grandeur, unseen, in, a, german, monarch, since, the, thirteenth, century, but, external, difficulties, self, inflicted, mistakes, and, the, extinction, of, the, luxembourg, male, line, made, this, vision, unfulfilled, frederick, iii, was, the, first, habsburg, to, be, crowned, holy, roman, emperor, in, 1452, he, had, been, very, careful, regarding, the, reform, movement, in, the, empire, for, most, of, his, reign, he, considered, reform, as, a, threat, to, his, imperial, prerogatives, he, avoided, direct, confrontations, which, might, lead, to, humiliation, if, the, princes, refused, to, give, way, after, 1440, the, reform, of, the, empire, and, church, was, sustained, and, led, by, local, and, regional, powers, particularly, the, territorial, princes, in, his, last, years, he, felt, more, pressure, on, taking, action, from, a, higher, level, berthold, von, henneberg, the, archbishop, of, mainz, who, spoke, on, behalf, of, reform, minded, princes, who, wanted, to, reform, the, empire, without, strengthening, the, imperial, hand, capitalized, on, frederick, s, desire, to, secure, the, imperial, election, for, his, son, maximilian, thus, in, his, last, years, he, presided, over, the, initial, phase, of, imperial, reform, which, would, mainly, unfold, under, his, maximilian, maximilian, himself, was, more, open, to, reform, although, naturally, he, also, wanted, to, preserve, and, enhance, imperial, prerogatives, after, frederick, retired, to, linz, in, 1488, as, a, compromise, maximilian, acted, as, mediator, between, the, princes, and, his, father, when, he, attained, sole, rule, after, frederick, s, death, he, would, continue, this, policy, of, brokerage, acting, as, the, impartial, judge, between, options, suggested, by, the, princes, major, measures, for, the, reform, were, launched, at, the, 1495, reichstag, at, worms, a, new, organ, was, introduced, the, reichskammergericht, that, was, to, be, largely, independent, from, the, emperor, a, new, tax, was, launched, to, finance, it, the, gemeine, pfennig, although, this, would, only, be, collected, under, charles, v, and, ferdinand, i, and, not, fully, to, create, a, rival, for, the, reichskammergericht, in, 1497, maximilian, establish, the, reichshofrat, which, had, its, seat, in, vienna, during, maximilian, s, reign, this, council, was, not, popular, though, in, the, long, run, the, two, courts, functioned, in, parallel, sometimes, overlapping, in, 1500, maximilian, agreed, to, establish, an, organ, called, the, reichsregiment, central, imperial, government, consisting, of, twenty, members, including, the, electors, with, the, emperor, or, his, representative, as, its, chairman, first, organized, in, 1501, in, nuremberg, but, maximilian, resented, the, new, organization, while, the, estates, failed, to, support, it, the, new, organ, proved, politically, weak, and, its, power, returned, to, maximilian, in, 1502, the, most, important, governmental, changes, targeted, the, heart, of, the, regime, the, chancery, early, in, maximilian, s, reign, the, court, chancery, at, innsbruck, competed, with, the, imperial, chancery, which, was, under, the, elector, archbishop, of, mainz, the, senior, imperial, chancellor, by, referring, the, political, matters, in, tyrol, austria, as, well, as, imperial, problems, to, the, court, chancery, maximilian, gradually, centralized, its, authority, the, two, chanceries, became, combined, in, 1502, in, 1496, the, emperor, created, a, general, treasury, hofkammer, in, innsbruck, which, became, responsible, for, all, the, hereditary, lands, the, chamber, of, accounts, raitkammer, at, vienna, was, made, subordinate, to, this, body, under, paul, von, liechtenstein, the, hofkammer, was, entrusted, with, not, only, hereditary, lands, affairs, but, maximilian, s, affairs, as, the, german, king, too, at, the, 1495, diet, of, worms, the, reception, of, roman, law, was, accelerated, and, formalized, the, roman, law, was, made, binding, in, german, courts, except, in, the, case, it, was, contrary, to, local, statutes, in, practice, it, became, the, basic, law, throughout, germany, displacing, germanic, local, law, to, a, large, extent, although, germanic, law, was, still, operative, at, the, lower, courts, other, than, the, desire, to, achieve, legal, unity, and, other, factors, the, adoption, also, highlighted, the, continuity, between, the, ancient, roman, empire, and, the, holy, roman, empire, to, realize, his, resolve, to, reform, and, unify, the, legal, system, the, emperor, frequently, intervened, personally, in, matters, of, local, legal, matters, overriding, local, charters, and, customs, this, practice, was, often, met, with, irony, and, scorn, from, local, councils, who, wanted, to, protect, local, codes, the, legal, reform, seriously, weakened, the, ancient, vehmic, court, vehmgericht, or, secret, tribunal, of, westphalia, traditionally, held, to, be, instituted, by, charlemagne, but, this, theory, is, now, considered, unlikely, although, it, would, not, be, abolished, completely, until, 1811, when, it, was, abolished, under, the, order, of, j, r, me, bonaparte, maximilian, and, charles, v, despite, the, fact, both, emperors, were, internationalists, personally, were, the, first, who, mobilized, the, rhetoric, of, the, nation, firmly, identified, with, the, reich, by, the, contemporary, humanists, with, encouragement, from, maximilian, and, his, humanists, iconic, spiritual, figures, were, reintroduced, or, became, notable, the, humanists, rediscovered, the, work, germania, written, by, tacitus, according, to, peter, h, wilson, the, female, figure, of, germania, was, reinvented, by, the, emperor, as, the, virtuous, pacific, mother, of, holy, roman, empire, of, the, german, nation, whaley, further, suggests, that, despite, the, later, religious, divide, patriotic, motifs, developed, during, maximilian, s, reign, both, by, maximilian, himself, and, by, the, humanist, writers, who, responded, to, him, formed, the, core, of, a, national, political, culture, maximilian, s, reign, also, witnessed, the, gradual, emergence, of, the, german, common, language, with, the, notable, roles, of, the, imperial, chancery, and, the, chancery, of, the, wettin, elector, frederick, the, wise, the, development, of, the, printing, industry, together, with, the, emergence, of, the, postal, system, the, first, modern, one, in, the, world, initiated, by, maximilian, himself, with, contribution, from, frederick, iii, and, charles, the, bold, led, to, a, revolution, in, communication, and, allowed, ideas, to, spread, unlike, the, situation, in, more, centralized, countries, the, decentralized, nature, of, the, empire, made, censorship, difficult, terence, mcintosh, comments, that, the, expansionist, aggressive, policy, pursued, by, maximilian, i, and, charles, v, at, the, inception, of, the, early, modern, german, nation, although, not, to, further, the, aims, specific, to, the, german, nation, per, se, relying, on, german, manpower, as, well, as, utilizing, fearsome, landsknechte, and, mercenaries, would, affect, the, way, neighbours, viewed, the, german, polity, although, in, the, longue, dur, e, germany, tended, to, be, at, peace, maximilian, was, the, first, holy, roman, emperor, in, 250, years, who, ruled, as, well, as, reigned, in, the, early, 1500s, he, was, true, master, of, the, empire, although, his, power, weakened, during, the, last, decade, before, his, death, whaley, notes, that, despite, struggles, what, emerged, at, the, end, of, maximilian, s, rule, was, a, strengthened, monarchy, and, not, an, oligarchy, of, princes, benjamin, curtis, opines, that, while, maximilian, was, not, able, to, fully, create, a, common, government, for, his, lands, although, the, chancellery, and, court, council, were, able, to, coordinate, affairs, across, the, realms, he, strengthened, key, administrative, functions, in, austria, and, created, central, offices, to, deal, with, financial, political, and, judicial, matters, these, offices, replaced, the, feudal, system, and, became, representative, of, a, more, modern, system, that, was, administered, by, professionalized, officials, after, two, decades, of, reforms, the, emperor, retained, his, position, as, first, among, equals, while, the, empire, gained, common, institutions, through, which, the, emperor, shared, power, with, the, estates, by, the, early, 16th, century, the, habsburg, rulers, had, become, the, most, powerful, in, europe, but, their, strength, relied, on, their, composite, monarchy, as, a, whole, and, not, only, the, holy, roman, empire, see, also, empire, of, charles, v, maximilian, had, seriously, considered, combining, the, burgundian, lands, inherited, from, his, wife, mary, of, burgundy, with, his, austrian, lands, to, form, a, powerful, core, while, also, extending, toward, the, east, after, the, unexpected, addition, of, spain, to, the, habsburg, empire, at, one, point, he, intended, to, leave, austria, raised, to, a, kingdom, to, his, younger, grandson, ferdinand, his, elder, grandson, charles, v, later, gave, spain, and, most, of, the, burgundian, lands, to, his, son, philip, ii, of, spain, the, founder, of, the, spanish, branch, and, the, habsburg, hereditary, lands, to, his, brother, ferdinand, the, founder, of, the, austrian, branch, in, france, and, england, from, the, 13th, century, onward, stationary, royal, residences, had, begun, to, develop, into, capital, cities, that, grew, rapidly, and, developed, corresponding, infrastructure, the, palais, de, la, cit, and, the, palace, of, westminster, became, the, respective, main, residences, this, was, not, possible, in, the, holy, roman, empire, because, no, real, hereditary, monarchy, emerged, but, rather, the, tradition, of, elective, monarchy, prevailed, see, imperial, election, which, in, the, high, middle, ages, led, to, kings, of, very, different, regional, origins, being, elected, list, of, royal, and, imperial, elections, in, the, holy, roman, empire, if, they, wanted, to, control, the, empire, and, its, rebellious, regional, rulers, they, could, not, limit, themselves, to, their, home, region, and, their, private, palaces, as, a, result, kings, and, emperors, continued, to, travel, around, the, empire, well, into, modern, times, using, their, temporary, residences, kaiserpfalz, as, transit, stations, for, their, itinerant, courts, from, the, late, middle, ages, onward, the, weakly, fortified, pfalzen, were, replaced, by, imperial,

century, where, most, of, the, following, habsburg, emperors, subsequently, resided, vienna, did, not, become, the, capital, of, the, empire, just, of, a, habsburg, hereditary, state, the, archduchy, of, austria, the, emperors, continued, to, travel, to, their, elections, and, coronations, at, frankfurt, and, aachen, to, the, imperial, diets, at, different, places, and, to, other, occasions, the,

true, sense, only, existed, in, the, second, german, empire, from, 1871, when, the, kaiser, reichstag, and, reichskanzler, resided, in, berlin, while, particularism, prevented, the, centralization, of, the, empire, it, gave, rise, to, early, developments, of, capitalism, in, italian, and, hanseatic, cities, like, genoa, and, pisa, hamburg, and, l, beck, warrior, merchants, appeared, and, pioneered, raiding, and, trading, maritime, empires, these, practices, declined, before, 1500, but, they, managed, to, spread, to, the, maritime, periphery, in, portugal, spain, the, netherlands, and, england, where, they, provoked, emulation, in, grander, oceanic, scale, william, thompson, agrees, with, m, n, pearson, that, this, distinctively, european, phenomenon, happened, because, in, the, italian, and, hanseatic, cities, which, lacked, resources, and, were, small, in, size, and, population, the, rulers, whose, social, status, was, not, much, higher, than, the, merchants, had, to, pay, attention, to, trade, thus, the, warrior, merchants, gained, the, state, s, coercive, powers, which, they, could, not, gain, in, mughal, or, other, asian, realms, whose, rulers, had, few, incentives, to, help, the, merchant, class, as, they, controlled, considerable, resources, and, their, revenue, was, land, bound, in, the, 1450s, the, economic, development, in, southern, germany, gave, rise, to, banking, empires, cartels, and, monopolies, in, cities, such, as, ulm, regensburg, and, augsburg, augsburg, in, particular, associated, with, the, reputation, of, the, fugger, welser, and, baumgartner, families, is, considered, the, capital, city, of, early, capitalism, augsburg, benefitted, majorly, from, the, establishment, and, expansion, of, the, kaiserliche, reichspost, in, the, late, 15th, and, early, 16th, century, even, when, the, habsburg, empire, began, to, extend, to, other, parts, of, europe, maximilian, s, loyalty, to, augsburg, where, he, conducted, a, lot, of, his, endeavours, meant, that, the, imperial, city, became, the, dominant, centre, of, early, capitalism, of, the, 16th, century, and, the, location, of, the, most, important, post, office, within, the, holy, roman, empire, from, maximilian, s, time, as, the, terminuses, of, the, first, transcontinental, post, lines, began, to, shift, from, innsbruck, to, venice, and, from, brussels, to, antwerp, in, these, cities, the, communication, system, and, the, news, market, started, to, converge, as, the, fuggers, as, well, as, other, trading, companies, based, their, most, important, branches, in, these, cities, these, traders, gained, access, to, these, systems, as, well, the, 1557, 1575, and, 1607, bankruptcies, of, the, spanish, branch, of, the, habsburgs, though, damaged, the, fuggers,

the, new, continent, on, the, other, hand, there, were, ports, in, abundance, to, release, the, plentiful, goods, obtained, from, those, new, lands, the, economic, pinnacles, achieved, in, germany, in, the, period, between, 1450, and, 1550, would, not, be, seen, again, until, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, in, the, netherlands, part, of, the, empire, financial, centres, evolved, together, with, markets, of, commodities, topographical, development, in, the, 15th, century, made, antwerp, a, port, city, boosted, by, the, privileges, it, received, as, a, loyal, city, after, the, flemish, revolts, against, maximilian, it, became, the, leading, seaport, city, in, northern, europe, and, served, as, the, conduit, for, a, remarkable, 40, of, world, trade, conflicts, with, the, habsburg, spanish, government, in, 1576, and, 1585, though, made, merchants, relocate, to, amsterdam, which, eventually, replaced, it, as, the, leading, port, city, in, 1516, ferdinand, ii, of, aragon, grandfather, of, the, future, holy, roman, emperor, charles, v, died, charles, initiated, his, reign, in, castile, and, aragon, a, union, which, evolved, into, spain, in, conjunction, with, his, mother, joanna, of, castile, in, 1519, already, reigning, as, carlos, i, in, spain, charles, took, up, the, imperial, title, as, karl, v, the, holy, roman, empire, would, end, up, going, to, a, more, junior, branch, of, the, habsburgs, in, the, person, of, charles, s, brother, ferdinand, while, the, senior, branch, continued, to, rule, in, spain, and, the, burgundian, inheritance, in, the, person, of, charles, s, son, philip, ii, of, spain, many, factors, contribute, to, this, result, for, james, d, tracy, it, was, the, polycentric, character, of, the, european, civilization, that, made, it, hard, to, maintain, a, dynasty, whose, territories, bestrode, the, continent, from, the, low, countries, to, sicily, and, from, spain, to, hungary, not, to, mention, spain, s, overseas, possessions, others, point, out, the, religious, tensions, fiscal, problems, and, obstruction, from, external, forces, including, france, and, the, ottomans, on, a, more, personal, level, charles, failed, to, persuade, the, german, princes, to, support, his, son, philip, whose, awkward, and, withdrawn, character, and, lack, of, german, language, skills, doomed, this, enterprise, to, failure, before, charles, s, reign, in, the, holy, roman, empire, began, in, 1517, martin, luther, launched, what, would, later, be, known, as, the, reformation, the, empire, then, became, divided, along, religious, lines, with, the, north, the, east, and, many, of, the, major, cities, strasbourg, frankfurt, and, nuremberg, becoming, protestant, while, the, southern, and, western, regions, largely, remained, catholic, at, the, beginning, of, charles, s, reign, another, reichsregiment, was, set, up, again, 1522, although, charles, declared, that, he, would, only, tolerate, it, in, his, absence, and, its, chairman, had, to, be, a, representative, of, his, charles, v, was, absent, in, germany, from, 1521, to, 1530, similar, to, the, one, set, up, in, the, early, 1500s, the, reichsregiment, failed, to, create, a, federal, authority, independent, of, the, emperor, due, to, the, unsteady, participation, and, differences, between, princes, charles, v, defeated, the, protestant, princes, in, 1547, in, the, schmalkaldic, war, but, the, momentum, was, lost, and, the, protestant, estates, were, able, to, survive, politically, despite, military, defeat, in, the, 1555, peace, of, augsburg, charles, v, through, his, brother, ferdinand, officially, recognized, the, right, of, rulers, to, choose, catholicism, or, lutheranism, zwinglians, calvinists, and, radicals, were, not, included, in, 1555, paul, iv, was, elected, pope, and, took, the, side, of, france, whereupon, an, exhausted, charles, finally, gave, up, his, hopes, of, a, world, christian, empire, germany, would, enjoy, relative, peace, for, the, next, six, decades, on, the, eastern, front, the, turks, continued, to, loom, large, as, a, threat, although, war, would, mean, further, compromises, with, the, protestant, princes, and, so, the, emperor, sought, to, avoid, it, in, the, west, the, rhineland, increasingly, fell, under, french, influence, after, the, dutch, revolt, against, spain, erupted, the, empire, remained, neutral, de, facto, allowing, the, netherlands, to, depart, the, empire, in, 1581, a, side, effect, was, the, cologne, war, which, ravaged, much, of, the, upper, rhine, emperor, ferdinand, iii, formally, accepted, dutch, neutrality, in, 1653, a, decision, ratified, by, the, reichstag, in, 1728, after, ferdinand, died, in, 1564, his, son, maximilian, ii, became, emperor, and, like, his, father, accepted, the, existence, of, protestantism, and, the, need, for, occasional, compromise, with, it, maximilian, was, succeeded, in, 1576, by, rudolf, ii, who, preferred, classical, greek, philosophy, to, christianity, and, lived, an, isolated, existence, in, bohemia, he, became, afraid, to, act, when, the, catholic, church, was, forcibly, reasserting, control, in, austria, and, hungary, and, the, protestant, princes, became, upset, over, this, imperial, power, sharply, deteriorated, by, the, time, of, rudolf, s, death, in, 1612, when, bohemians, rebelled, against, the, emperor, the, immediate, result, was, the, series, of, conflicts, known, as, the, thirty, years, war, 1618, 1648, which, devastated, the, empire, foreign, powers, including, france, and, sweden, intervened, in, the, conflict, and, strengthened, those, fighting, the, imperial, power, but, also, seized, considerable, territory, for, themselves, accordingly, the, empire, could, never, return, to, its, former, glory, leading, voltaire, to, make, his, infamous, quip, that, the, holy, roman, empire, was, neither, holy, nor, roman, nor, an, empire, still, its, actual, end, did, not, come, for, two, centuries, the, peace, of, westphalia, in, 1648, which, ended, the, thirty, years, war, allowed, calvinism, but, anabaptists, arminians, and, other, protestant, communities, would, still, lack, any, support, and, continue, to, be, persecuted, well, until, the, end, of, the, empire, the, habsburg, emperors, focused, on, consolidating, their, own, estates, in, austria, and, elsewhere, at, the, battle, of, vienna, 1683, the, army, of, the, holy, roman, empire, led, by, the, polish, king, john, iii, sobieski, decisively, defeated, a, large, turkish, army, stopping, the, western, ottoman, advance, and, leading, to, the, eventual, dismemberment, of, the, ottoman, empire, in, europe, the, army, was, one, third, forces, of, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, and, two, thirds, forces, of, the, holy, roman, empire, by, the, rise, of, louis, xiv, the, habsburgs, were, chiefly, dependent, on, their, hereditary, lands, to, counter, the, rise, of, prussia, which, possessed, territories, inside, the, empire, throughout, the, 18th, century, the, habsburgs, were, embroiled, in, various, european, conflicts, such, as, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, 1701, 1714, the, war, of, the, polish, succession, 1733, 1735, and, the, war, of, the, austrian, succession, 1740, 1748, the, german, dualism, between, austria, and, prussia, dominated, the, empire, s, history, after, 1740, from, 1792, onward, revolutionary, france, was, at, war, with, various, parts, of, the, empire, intermittently, the, german, mediatization, was, the, series, of, mediatizations, and, secularizations, that, occurred, between, 1795, and, 1814, during, the, latter, part, of, the, era, of, the, french, revolution, and, then, the, napoleonic, era, mediatization, was, the, process, of, annexing, the, lands, of, one, imperial, estate, to, another, often, leaving, the, annexed, some, rights, for, example, the, estates, of, the, imperial, knights, were, formally, mediatized, in, 1806, having, de, facto, been, seized, by, the, great, territorial, states, in, 1803, in, the, so, called, rittersturm, secularization, was, the, abolition, of, the, temporal, power, of, an, ecclesiastical, ruler, such, as, a, bishop, or, an, abbot, and, the, annexation, of, the, secularized, territory, to, a, secular, territory, the, empire, was, dissolved, on, 6, august, 1806, when, the, last, holy, roman, emperor, francis, ii, from, 1804, emperor, francis, i, of, austria, abdicated, following, a, military, defeat, by, the, french, under, napoleon, at, the, battle, of, austerlitz, in, 1805, see, treaty, of, pressburg, napoleon, reorganized, much, of, the, empire, into, the, confederation, of, the, rhine, a, french, satellite, francis, house, of, habsburg, lorraine, survived, the, demise, of, the, empire, continuing, to, reign, as, emperors, of, austria, and, kings, of, hungary, until, the, habsburg, empire, s, final, dissolution, in, 1918, in, the, aftermath, of, world, war, i, the, napoleonic, confederation, of, the, rhine, was, replaced, by, a, new, union, the, german, confederation, in, 1815, following, the, end, of, the, napoleonic, wars, it, lasted, until, 1866, when, prussia, founded, the, north, german, confederation, a, forerunner, of, the, german, empire, which, united, the, german, speaking, territories, outside, of, austria, and, switzerland, under, prussian, leadership, in, 1871, this, state, developed, into, modern, germany, the, abdication, indicated, that, the, kaiser, no, longer, felt, capable, of, fulfilling, his, duties, as, head, of, the, reich, and, so, declared, that, we, consider, the, tie, that, has, bound, us, to, the, body, politic, of, the, german, reich, to, be, broken, that, we, have, expired, the, office, and, dignity, of, the, head, of, the, reich, through, the, unification, of, the, confederated, rhenish, estates, and, that, we, are, thereby, relieved, of, all, the, duties, we, have, assumed, towards, the, german, reich, consider, counted, and, lay, down, the, imperial, crown, worn, by, the, same, until, now, and, conducted, imperial, government, as, is, hereby, done, the, only, princely, member, states, of, the, holy, roman, empire, that, have, preserved, their, status, as, monarchies, until, today, are, the, grand, duchy, of, luxembourg, and, the, principality, of, liechtenstein, the, only, free, imperial, cities, still, existing, as, states, within, germany, are, hamburg, and, bremen, all, other, historic, member, states, of, the, holy, roman, empire, were, either, dissolved, or, have, adopted, republican, systems, of, government, overall, population, figures, for, the, holy, roman, empire, are, extremely, vague, and, vary, widely, the, empire, of, charlemagne, may, have, had, as, many, as, 20, million, people, given, the, political, fragmentation, of, the, later, empire, there, were, no, central, agencies, that, could, compile, such, figures, nevertheless, it, is, believed, the, demographic, disaster, of, the, thirty, years, war, meant, that, the, population, of, the, empire, in, the, early, 17th, century, was, similar, to, what, it, was, in, the, early, 18th, century, by, one, estimate, the, empire, did, not, exceed, 1618, levels, of, population, until, 1750, in, the, early, 17th, century, the, electors, held, under, their, rule, the, following, number, of, imperial, subjects, while, not, electors, the, spanish, habsburgs, had, the, second, highest, number, of, subjects, within, the, empire, after, the, austrian, habsburgs, with, over, 3, million, in, the, early, 17th, century, in, the, burgundian, circle, and, duchy, of, milan, peter, wilson, estimates, the, empire, s, population, at, 20, million, in, 1700, of, whom, 5, million, lived, in, imperial, italy, by, 1800, he, estimates, the, empire, s, population, at, 29, million, excluding, italy, with, another, 12, 6, million, held, by, the, austrians, and, prussians, outside, of, the, empire, according, to, a, contemporary, estimate, of, the, austrian, war, archives, for, the, first, decade, of, the, 18th, century, the, empire, including, bohemia, and, the, spanish, netherlands, had, a, population, of, close, to, 28, million, with, a, breakdown, as, follows, german, demographic, historians, have, traditionally, worked, on, estimates, of, the, population, of, the, holy, roman, empire, based, on, assumed, population, within, the, frontiers, of, germany, in, 1871, or, 1914, more, recent, estimates, use, less, outdated, criteria, but, they, remain, guesswork, one, estimate, based, on, the, frontiers, of, germany, in, 1870, gives, a, population, of, some, 15, 17, million, around, 1600, declined, to, 10, 13, million, around, 1650, following, the, thirty, years, war, other, historians, who, work, on, estimates, of, the, population, of, the, early, modern, empire, suggest, the, population, declined, from, 20, million, to, some, 16, 17, million, by, 1650, a, credible, estimate, for, 1800, gives, 27, 28, million, inhabitants, for, the, empire, which, at, this, point, had, already, lost, the, remaining, low, countries, italy, and, the, left, bank, of, the, rhine, in, the, 1797, treaty, of, campo, fornio, with, an, overall, breakdown, as, follows, there, are, also, numerous, estimates, for, the, italian, states, that, were, formally, part, of, the, empire, largest, cities, or, towns, of, the, empire, by, year, catholicism, constituted, the, single, official, religion, of, the, empire, until, 1555, the, holy, roman, emperor, was, always, catholic, lutheranism, was, officially, recognized, in, the, peace, of, augsburg, of, 1555, and, calvinism, in, the, peace, of, westphalia, of, 1648, those, two, constituted, the, only, officially, recognized, protestant, denominations, while, various, other, protestant, confessions, such, as, anabaptism, arminianism, etc, coexisted, illegally, within, the, empire, anabaptism, came, in, a, variety, of, denominations, including, mennonites, schwarzenau, brethren, hutterites, the, amish, and, multiple, other, groups, following, the, peace, of, augsburg, the, official, religion, of, a, territory, was, determined, by, the, principle, cuius, regio, eius, religio, according, to, which, a, ruler, s, religion, determined, that, of, his, subjects, the, peace, of, westphalia, abrogated, that, principle, by, stipulating, that, the, official, religion, of, a, territory, was, to, be, what, it, had, been, on, 1, january, 1624, considered, to, have, been, a, normal, year, henceforth, the, conversion, of, a, ruler, to, another, faith, did, not, entail, the, conversion, of, his, subjects, in, addition, all, protestant, subjects, of, a, catholic, ruler, and, vice, versa, were, guaranteed, the, rights, that, they, had, enjoyed, on, that, date, while, the, adherents, of, a, territory, s, official, religion, enjoyed, the, right, of, public, worship, the, others, were, allowed, the, right, of, private, worship, in, chapels, without, either, spires, or, bells, in, theory, no, one, was, to, be, discriminated, against, or, excluded, from, commerce, trade, craft, or, public, burial, on, grounds, of, religion, for, the, first, time, the, permanent, nature, of, the, division, between, the, christian, churches, of, the, empire, was, more, or, less, assumed, a, jewish, minority, existed, in, the, holy, roman, empire, the, holy, roman, emperors, claimed, the, right, of, protection, and, taxation, of, all, the, jews, of, the, empire, but, there, were, also, large, scale, massacres, of, jews, especially, at, the, time, of, the, first, crusade, and, during, the, wars, of, religion, in, the, 16th, century, the, holy, roman, empire, was, neither, a, centralized, state, nor, a, nation, state, instead, it, was, divided, into, dozens, eventually, hundreds, of, individual, entities, governed, by, kings, dukes, counts, bishops, abbots, and, other, rulers, collectively, known, as, princes, there, were, also, some, areas, ruled, directly, by, the, emperor, from, the, high, middle, ages, onwards, the, holy, roman, empire, was, marked, by, an, uneasy, coexistence, with, the, princes, of, the, local, territories, who, were, struggling, to, take, power, away, from, it, to, a, greater, extent, than, in, other, medieval, kingdoms, such, as, france, and, england, the, emperors, were, unable, to, gain, much, control, over, the, lands, that, they, formally, owned, instead, to, secure, their, own, position, from, the, threat, of, being, deposed, emperors, were, forced, to, grant, more, and, more, autonomy, to, local, rulers, both, nobles, and, bishops, this, process, began, in, the, 11th, century, with, the, investiture, controversy, and, was, more, or, less, concluded, with, the, 1648, peace, of, westphalia, several, emperors, attempted, to, reverse, this, steady, dilution, of, their, authority, but, were, thwarted, both, by, the, papacy, and, by, the, princes, of, the, empire, the, number, of, territories, represented, in, the, imperial, diet, was, considerable, numbering, about, 300, at, the, time, of, the, peace, of, westphalia, many, of, these, kleinstaaten, little, states, covered, no, more, than, a, few, square, miles, or, included, several, non, contiguous, pieces, so, the, empire, was, often, called, a, flickenteppich, patchwork, carpet, an, entity, was, considered, a, reichsstand, imperial, estate, if, according, to, feudal, law, it, had, no, authority, above, it, except, the, holy, roman, emperor, himself, the, imperial, estates, comprised, a, sum, total, of, 1, 500, imperial, estates, has, been, reckoned, for, a, list, of, reichsst, nde, in, 1792, see, list, of, imperial, diet, participants, 1792, the, most, powerful, lords, of, the, later, empire, were, the, austrian, habsburgs, who, ruled, 240, 000,

7, 700, sq, mi, and, the, ecclesiastical, electorates, of, mainz, cologne, and, trier, were, much, smaller, with, around, 7, 000, km, 2, 2, 700, sq, mi, just, larger, than, them, with, roughly, 7,

of, the, salian, dynasty, in, the, 12th, century, in, 1356, emperor, charles, iv, issued, the, golden, bull, which, limited, the, electors, to, seven, the, king, of, bohemia, the, count, palatine, of, the, rhine, the, duke, of, saxony, the, margrave, of, brandenburg, and, the, archbishops, of, cologne, mainz, and, trier, during, the, thirty, years, war, the, duke, of, bavaria, was, given, the, right, to, vote, as, the, eighth, elector, and, the, duke, of, brunswick, l, neburg, colloquially, hanover, was, granted, a, ninth, electorate, additionally, the, napoleonic, wars, resulted, in, several, electorates, being, reallocated, but, these, new, electors, never, voted, before, the, empire, s, dissolution, a, candidate, for, election, would, be, expected, to, offer, concessions, of, land, or, money, to, the, electors, in, order, to, secure, their, vote, after, being, elected, the, king, of, the, romans, could, theoretically, claim, the, title, of, emperor, only, after, being, crowned, by, the, pope, in, many, cases, this, took, several, years, while, the, king, was, held, up, by, other, tasks, frequently, he, first, had, to, resolve, conflicts, in, rebellious, northern, italy, or, was, quarreling, with, the, pope, himself, later, emperors, dispensed, with, the, papal, coronation, altogether, being, content, with, the, styling, emperor, elect, the, last, emperor, to, be, crowned, by, the, pope, was, charles, v, in, 1530, the, emperor, had, to, be, male, and, of, noble, blood, no, law, required, him, to, be, a, catholic, but, as, the, majority, of, the, electors, adhered, to, this, faith, no, protestant, was, ever, elected, whether, and, to, what, degree, he, had, to, be, german, was, disputed, among, the, electors, contemporary, experts, in, constitutional, law, and, the, public, during, the, middle, ages, some, kings, and, emperors, were, not, of, german, origin, but, since, the, renaissance, german, heritage, was, regarded, as, vital, for, a, candidate, in, order, to, be, eligible, for, imperial, office, the, imperial, diet, reichstag, or, reichsversammlung, was, not, a, legislative, body, as, is, understood, today, as, its, members, envisioned, it, to, be, more, like, a, central, forum, where, it, was, more, important, to, negotiate, than, to, decide, the, diet, was, theoretically, superior, to, the, emperor, himself, it, was, divided, into, three, classes, the, first, class, the, council, of, electors, consisted, of, the, electors, or, the, princes, who, could, vote, for, king, of, the, romans, the, second, class, the, council, of, princes, consisted, of, the, other, princes, the, council, of, princes, was, divided, into, two, benches, one, for, secular, rulers, and, one, for, ecclesiastical, ones, higher, ranking, princes, had, individual, votes, while, lower, ranking, princes, were, grouped, into, colleges, by, geography, each, college, had, one, vote, the, third, class, was, the, council, of, imperial, cities, which, was, divided, into, two, colleges, swabia, and, the, rhine, the, council, of, imperial, cities, was, not, fully, equal, with, the, others, it, could, not, vote, on, several, matters, such, as, the, admission, of, new, territories, the, representation, of, the, free, cities, at, the, diet, had, become, common, since, the, late, middle, ages, nevertheless, their, participation, was, formally, acknowledged, only, as, late, as, 1648, with, the, peace, of, westphalia, ending, the, thirty, years, war, the, empire, also, had, two, courts, the, reichshofrat, also, known, in, english, as, the, aulic, council, at, the, court, of, the, king, emperor, and, the, reichskammergericht, imperial, chamber, court, established, with, the, imperial, reform, of, 1495, by, maximilian, i, the, reichskammergericht, and, the, aulic, council, were, the, two, highest, judicial, instances, in, the, old, empire, the, imperial, chamber, court, s, composition, was, determined, by, both, the, holy, roman, emperor, and, the, subject, states, of, the, empire, within, this, court, the, emperor, appointed, the, chief, justice, always, a, highborn, aristocrat, several, divisional, chief, judges, and, some, of, the, other, puisne, judges, the, aulic, council, held, standing, over, many, judicial, disputes, of, state, both, in, concurrence, with, the, imperial, chamber, court, and, exclusively, on, their, own, the, provinces, imperial, chamber, court, extended, to, breaches, of, the, public, peace, cases, of, arbitrary, distraint, or, imprisonment, pleas, which, concerned, the, treasury, violations, of, the, emperor, s, decrees, or, the, laws, passed, by, the, imperial, diet, disputes, about, property, between, immediate, tenants, of, the, empire, or, the, subjects, of, different, rulers, and, finally, suits, against, immediate, tenants, of, the, empire, with, the, exception, of, criminal, charges, and, matters, relating, to, imperial, fiefs, which, went, to, the, aulic, council, the, aulic, council, even, allowed, the, emperors, the, means, to, depose, rulers, who, did, not, live, up, to, expectations, as, part, of, the, imperial, reform, six, imperial, circles, were, established, in, 1500, four, more, were, established, in, 1512, these, were, regional, groupings, of, most, though, not, all, of, the, various, states, of, the, empire, for, the, purposes, of, defense, imperial, taxation, supervision, of, coining, peace, keeping, functions, and, public, security, each, circle, had, its, own, parliament, known, as, a, kreistag, circle, diet, and, one, or, more, directors, who, coordinated, the, affairs, of, the, circle, not, all, imperial, territories, were, included, within, the, imperial, circles, even, after, 1512, the, lands, of, the, bohemian, crown, were, excluded, as, were, switzerland, the, imperial, fiefs, in, northern, italy, the, lands, of, the, imperial, knights, and, certain, other, small, territories, like, the, lordship, of, jever, the, army, of, the, holy, roman, empire, german, reichsarmee, reichsheer, or, reichsarmatur, latin, exercitus, imperii, was, created, in, 1422, and, as, a, result, of, the, napoleonic, wars, came, to, an, end, even, before, the, empire, it, should, not, be, confused, with, the, imperial, army, kaiserliche, armee, of, the, emperor, despite, appearances, to, the, contrary, the, army, of, the, empire, did, not, constitute, a, permanent, standing, army, that, was, always, at, the, ready, to, fight, for, the, empire, when, there, was, danger, an, army, of, the, empire, was, mustered, from, among, the, elements, constituting, it, in, order, to, conduct, an, imperial, military, campaign, or, reichsheerfahrt, in, practice, the, imperial, troops, often, had, local, allegiances, stronger, than, their, loyalty, to, the, emperor, throughout, the, first, half, of, its, history, the, holy, roman, empire, was, reigned, over, by, a, travelling, court, kings, and, emperors, toured, between, the, numerous, kaiserpfalzes, imperial, palaces, usually, resided, for, several, weeks, or, months, and, furnished, local, legal, matters, law, and, administration, most, rulers, maintained, one, or, a, number, of, favourites, imperial, palace, sites, where, they, would, advance, development, and, spent, most, of, their, time, charlemagne, aachen, from, 794, otto, i, magdeburg, from, 955,

practice, eventually, ended, during, the, 16th, century, as, the, emperors, of, the, habsburg, dynasty, chose, vienna, and, prague, and, the, wittelsbach, rulers, chose, munich, as, their, permanent, residences, maximilian, i, s, true, home, was, still, the, stirrup, the, overnight, rest, and, the, saddle, although, innsbruck, was, probably, his, most, important, base, charles, v, was, also, a,

was, established, in, vienna, in, 1495, the, reichskammergericht, was, established, which, variously, resided, in, worms, augsburg, nuremberg, regensburg, speyer, and, esslingen, before, it, was, moved, permanently, to, wetzlar, the, habsburg, royal, family, had, its, own, diplomats, to, represent, its, interests, the, larger, principalities, in, the, holy, roman, empire, beginning, around, 1648, also, did, the, same, the, holy, roman, empire, did, not, have, its, own, dedicated, ministry, of, foreign, affairs, and, therefore, the, imperial, diet, had, no, control, over, these, diplomats, occasionally, the, diet, criticised, them, when, regensburg, served, as, the, site, of, the, diet, france, and, in, the, late, 1700s, russia, had, diplomatic, representatives, there, the, kings, of, denmark, great, britain, and, sweden, had, land, holdings, in, germany, and, so, had, representation, in, the, diet, itself, the, netherlands, also, had, envoys, in, regensburg, regensburg, was, the, place, where, envoys, met, as, it, was, where, representatives, of, the, diet, could, be, reached, some, constituencies, of, the, holy, roman, empire, had, additional, royal, or, imperial, territories, that, were, sometimes, from, the, outset, outside, the, jurisdiction, of, the, holy, roman, empire, henry, vi, inheriting, both, german, aspirations, for, imperial, sovereignty, and, the, norman, sicilian, kings, dream, of, hegemony, in, the, mediterranean, had, ambitious, design, for, a, world, empire, boettcher, remarks, that, marriage, policy, also, played, an, important, role, here, the, marital, policy, of, the, staufer, ranged, from, iberia, to, russia, from, scandinavia, to, sicily, from, england, to, byzantium, and, to, the, crusader, states, in, the, east, henry, was, already, casting, his, eyes, beyond, africa, and, greece, to, asia, minor, and, syria, and, of, course, on, jerusalem, his, annexation, of, sicily, changed, the, strategic, balance, in, the, italian, peninsula, the, emperor, who, wanted, to, make, all, his, lands, hereditary, also, asserted, that, papal, fiefs, were, imperial, fiefs, on, his, death, at, the, age, of, 31, though, he, was, unable, to, pass, his, powerful, position, to, his, son, frederick, ii, who, had, only, been, elected, king, of, the, romans, the, union, between, sicily, and, the, empire, thus, remained, personal, union, frederick, ii, became, king, of, sicily, in, 1225, through, marriage, to, isabella, ii, or, yolande, of, jerusalem, and, regained, bethlehem, and, nazareth, for, the, christian, side, through, negotiation, with, al, kamil, the, hohenstaufen, dream, of, world, empire, ended, with, frederick, s, death, in, 1250, though, in, its, earlier, days, the, empire, provided, the, principal, medium, for, christianity, to, infiltrate, the, pagans, realms, in, the, north, and, the, east, scandinavians, magyars, slavic, people, etc, by, the, reform, era, the, empire, in, its, nature, was, defensive, and, not, aggressive, desiring, of, both, internal, peace, and, security, against, invading, forces, a, fact, that, even, warlike, princes, such, as, maximilian, i, appreciated, in, the, early, modern, age, the, association, with, the, church, the, church, universal, for, the, luxemburgs, and, the, catholic, church, for, the, habsburgs, as, well, as, the, emperor, s, responsibility, for, the, defence, of, central, europe, remained, a, reality, though, even, the, trigger, for, the, conception, of, the, imperial, reform, under, sigismund, was, the, idea, of, helping, the, church, to, put, its, house, in, order, traditionally, german, dynasties, had, exploited, the, potential, of, the, imperial, title, to, bring, eastern, europe, into, the, fold, in, addition, to, their, lands, north, and, south, of, the, alps, marriage, and, inheritance, strategies, following, by, usually, defensive, warfare, played, a, great, role, both, for, the, luxemburgs, and, the, habsburgs, it, was, under, sigismund, of, the, luxemburg, who, married, mary, queen, regnal, and, the, rightful, heir, of, hungary, and, later, consolidated, his, power, with, the, marriage, to, the, capable, and, well, connected, noblewoman, barbara, of, cilli, that, the, emperor, s, personal, empire, expanded, to, a, kingdom, outside, the, boundary, of, the, holy, roman, empire, hungary, this, last, monarch, of, the, luxemburg, dynasty, who, wore, four, royal, crowns, had, managed, to, gain, an, empire, almost, comparable, in, scale, to, the, later, habsburg, empire, although, at, the, same, time, they, lost, the, kingdom, of, burgundy, and, control, over, italian, territories, the, luxemburgs, focus, on, the, east, especially, hungary, allowed, the, new, burgundian, rulers, from, the, valois, dynasty, to, foster, discontent, among, german, princes, thus, the, habsburgs, were, forced, to, refocus, their, attention, on, the, west, frederick, iii, s, cousin, and, predecessor, albert, ii, of, germany, who, was, sigismund, s, son, in, law, and, heir, through, his, marriage, with, elizabeth, of, luxembourg, had, managed, to, combine, the, crowns, of, germany, hungary, bohemia, and, croatia, under, his, rule, but, he, died, young, during, his, rule, maximilian, i, had, a, double, focus, on, both, the, east, and, the, west, the, successful, expansion, with, the, notable, role, of, marriage, policy, under, maximilian, bolstered, his, position, in, the, empire, and, also, created, more, pressure, for, an, imperial, reform, so, that, they, could, get, more, resources, and, coordinated, help, from, the, german, territories, to, defend, their, realms, and, counter, hostile, powers, such, as, france, ever, since, he, became, king, of, the, romans, in, 1486, the, empire, provided, essential, help, for, his, activities, in, burgundian, netherlands, as, well, as, dealings, with, bohemia, hungary, and, other, eastern, polities, in, the, reigns, of, his, grandsons, croatia, and, the, remaining, rump, of, the, hungarian, kingdom, chose, ferdinand, as, their, ruler, after, he, managed, to, rescue, silesia, and, bohemia, from, hungary, s, fate, against, the, ottoman, simms, notes, that, their, choice, was, a, contractual, one, tying, ferdinand, s, rulership, in, these, kingdoms, and, territories, to, his, election, as, king, of, the, romans, and, his, ability, to, defend, central, europe, in, turn, the, habsburgs, imperial, rule, also, depended, on, holding, these, additional, extensive, lands, as, independent, sources, of, wealth, and, prestige, the, later, austrian, habsburgs, from, ferdinand, i, were, careful, to, maintain, a, distinction, between, their, dynastic, empire, and, the, holy, roman, empire, peter, wilson, argues, that, the, institutions, and, structures, developed, by, the, imperial, reform, mostly, served, german, lands, and, although, the, habsburg, monarchy, remained, closely, entwined, with, the, empire, the, habsburgs, deliberately, refrained, from, including, their, other, territories, in, its, framework, instead, they, developed, their, own, institutions, to, manage, what, was, effectively, a, parallel, dynastic, territorial, empire, and, which, gave, them, an, overwhelming, superiority, of, resources, in, turn, allowing, them, to, retain, an, almost, unbroken, grip, on, the, imperial, title, over, the, next, three, centuries, ferdinand, had, an, interest, in, keeping, bohemia, separate, from, imperial, jurisdiction, and, making, the, connection, between, bohemia, and, the, empire, looser, bohemia, did, not, have, to, pay, taxes, to, the, empire, as, he, refused, the, rights, of, an, imperial, elector, as, king, of, bohemia, which, provided, him, with, half, of, his, revenue, he, was, able, to, give, bohemia, as, well, as, associated, territories, such, as, upper, and, lower, alsatia, silesia, and, moravia, the, same, privileged, status, as, austria, therefore, affirming, his, superior, position, in, the, empire, the, habsburgs, also, tried, to, mobilize, imperial, aid, for, hungary, which, throughout, the, 16th, century, cost, the, dynasty, more, money, in, defence, expenditure, than, the, total, revenue, it, yielded, since, 1542, charles, v, and, ferdinand, had, been, able, to, collect, the, common, penny, tax, or, t, rkenhilfe, turkish, aid, designed, to, protect, the, empire, against, the, ottomans, or, france, but, as, hungary, unlike, bohemia, was, not, part, of, the, empire, the, imperial, aid, for, hungary, depended, on, political, factors, the, obligation, was, only, in, effect, if, vienna, or, the, empire, were, threatened, wilson, notes, that, in, the, early, 1520s, the, reichstag, hesitated, to, vote, aid, for, hungary, s, king, louis, ii, because, it, regarded, him, as, a, foreign, prince, this, changed, once, hungary, passed, to, the, habsburgs, on, louis, death, in, battle, in, 1526, and, the, main, objective, of, imperial, taxation, across, the, next, 90, years, was, to, subsidize, the, cost, of, defending, the, hungarian, frontier, against, the, ottomans, the, bulk, of, the, weaponry, and, other, military, materiel, was, supplied, by, firms, based, in, the, empire, and, financed, by, german, banks, the, same, is, true, of, the, troops, who, eventually, evicted, the, ottomans, from, hungary, between, 1683, and, 1699, the, imperial, law, code, of, 1532, was, used, in, parts, of, hungary, until, the, mid, 17th, century, but, otherwise, hungary, had, its, own, legal, system, and, did, not, import, austrian, ones, hungarian, nobles, resisted, the, use, of, germanic, titles, like, graf, for, count, until, 1606, and, very, few, acquired, the, personal, status, of, imperial, prince, responding, to, the, opinion, that, the, habsburg, s, dynastic, concerns, were, damaging, to, the, holy, roman, empire, whaley, writes, that, there, was, no, fundamental, incompatibility, between, dynasticism, and, participation, in, the, empire, either, for, the, habsburgs, or, for, the, saxons, or, others, imperial, marriage, strategies, had, double, edged, effects, for, the, holy, roman, empire, though, the, spanish, connection, was, an, example, while, it, provided, a, powerful, partner, in, the, defence, of, christendom, against, the, ottomans, it, allowed, charles, v, to, transfer, the, burgundian, netherlands, franche, comte, as, well, as, other, imperial, fiefs, such, as, milan, to, his, son, philip, ii, s, spanish, empire, other, than, the, imperial, families, other, german, princes, possessed, foreign, lands, as, well, and, foreign, rulers, could, also, acquire, imperial, fiefs, and, thus, become, imperial, princes, this, phenomenon, contributed, to, the, fragmentation, of, sovereignty, in, which, imperial, vassals, remained, semi, sovereign, while, strengthening, the, interconnections, and, chances, of, mutual, interference, between, the, kingdom, of, germany, and, the, empire, in, general, with, other, kingdoms, such, as, denmark, and, sweden, who, accepted, the, status, of, imperial, vassals, on, behalf, of, their, german, possessions, which, were, subjected, to, imperial, laws, the, two, scandinanvian, monarchies, honoured, the, obligations, to, come, to, the, aid, of, the, empire, in, the, wars, of, 17th, and, early, 18th, centuries, they, also, imported, german, princely, families, as, rulers, although, in, both, cases, this, did, not, produce, direct, unions, denmark, consistently, tried, to, take, advantage, of, its, influence, in, imperial, institutions, to, gain, new, imperial, fiefs, along, the, elbe, although, these, attempts, generally, did, not, succeed
