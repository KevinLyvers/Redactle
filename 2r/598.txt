https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scramble_for_Africa
the, scramble, for, africa, was, the, conquest, and, colonisation, of, most, of, africa, by, seven, western, european, powers, driven, by, the, second, industrial, revolution, during, the, era, of, new, imperialism, 1833, 1914, belgium, france, germany, great, britain, italy, portugal, and, spain, in, 1870, 10, of, the, continent, was, formally, under, european, control, by, 1914, this, figure, had, risen, to, almost, 90, with, only, liberia, and, ethiopia, retaining, sovereignty, along, with, egba, senusiyya, mbunda, and, the, ovambo, kingdoms, which, were, later, conquered, the, 1884, berlin, conference, regulated, european, colonisation, and, trade, in, africa, and, is, seen, as, emblematic, of, the, scramble, in, the, last, quarter, of, the, 19th, century, there, were, considerable, political, rivalries, between, the, european, empires, which, provided, the, impetus, for, the, colonisation, the, later, years, of, the, 19th, century, saw, a, transition, from, informal, imperialism, military, influence, and, economic, dominance, to, direct, rule, with, the, decline, of, the, european, colonial, empires, in, the, wake, of, the, two, world, wars, most, african, colonies, gained, independence, during, the, cold, war, and, decided, to, keep, their, colonial, borders, in, the, organisation, of, african, unity, conference, of, 1964, due, to, fears, of, civil, wars, and, regional, instability, placing, emphasis, on, pan, africanism, by, 1841, businessmen, from, europe, had, established, small, trading, posts, along, the, coasts, of, africa, but, they, seldom, moved, inland, preferring, to, stay, near, the, sea, they, primarily, traded, with, locals, large, parts, of, the, continent, were, essentially, uninhabitable, for, europeans, because, of, their, high, mortality, rates, from, tropical, diseases, such, as, malaria, in, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, european, explorers, mapped, much, of, east, africa, and, central, africa, as, late, as, the, 1870s, europeans, controlled, approximately, 10, of, the, african, continent, with, all, their, territories, located, near, the, coasts, the, most, important, holdings, were, angola, and, mozambique, held, by, portugal, the, cape, colony, held, by, the, united, kingdom, and, algeria, held, by, france, by, 1914, only, ethiopia, and, liberia, remained, outside, european, control, with, the, former, eventually, being, occupied, by, italy, in, 1936, while, the, latter, having, strong, connections, with, its, historical, colonizer, the, united, states, technological, advances, facilitated, european, expansion, overseas, industrialization, brought, about, rapid, advancements, in, transportation, and, communication, especially, in, the, forms, of, steamships, railways, and, telegraphs, medical, advances, also, played, an, important, role, especially, medicines, for, tropical, diseases, which, helped, control, their, adverse, effects, the, development, of, quinine, an, effective, treatment, for, malaria, made, vast, expanses, of, the, tropics, more, accessible, for, europeans, sub, saharan, africa, one, of, the, last, regions, of, the, world, largely, untouched, by, informal, imperialism, was, attractive, to, business, entrepreneurs, during, a, time, when, britain, s, balance, of, trade, showed, a, growing, deficit, with, shrinking, and, increasingly, protectionist, continental, markets, during, the, long, depression, 1873, 1896, africa, offered, britain, germany, france, and, other, countries, an, open, market, that, would, garner, them, a, trade, surplus, a, market, that, bought, more, from, the, colonial, power, than, it, sold, overall, surplus, capital, was, often, more, profitably, invested, overseas, where, cheap, materials, limited, competition, and, abundant, raw, materials, made, a, greater, premium, possible, another, inducement, for, imperialism, arose, from, the, demand, for, raw, materials, especially, ivory, rubber, palm, oil, cocoa, diamonds, tea, and, tin, additionally, britain, wanted, control, of, areas, of, the, southern, and, eastern, coasts, of, africa, for, stopover, ports, on, the, route, to, asia, and, its, empire, in, india, but, excluding, the, area, that, became, the, union, of, south, africa, in, 1910, european, nations, invested, relatively, limited, amounts, of, capital, in, africa, pro, imperialist, colonial, lobbyists, such, as, the, alldeutscher, verband, francesco, crispi, and, jules, ferry, argued, that, sheltered, overseas, markets, in, africa, would, solve, the, problems, of, low, prices, and, overproduction, caused, by, shrinking, continental, markets, john, a, hobson, argued, in, imperialism, that, this, shrinking, of, continental, markets, was, a, key, factor, of, the, global, new, imperialism, period, william, easterly, however, disagrees, with, the, link, made, between, capitalism, and, imperialism, arguing, that, colonialism, is, used, mostly, to, promote, state, led, development, rather, than, corporate, development, he, has, said, that, imperialism, is, not, so, clearly, linked, to, capitalism, and, the, free, markets, historically, there, has, been, a, closer, link, between, colonialism, imperialism, and, state, led, approaches, to, development, while, tropical, africa, was, not, a, large, zone, of, investment, other, overseas, regions, were, the, vast, interior, between, egypt, and, the, gold, and, diamond, rich, southern, africa, had, strategic, value, in, securing, the, flow, of, overseas, trade, britain, was, under, political, pressure, to, build, up, lucrative, markets, in, india, malaya, australia, and, new, zealand, thus, it, wanted, to, secure, the, key, waterway, between, east, and, west, the, suez, canal, completed, in, 1869, however, a, theory, that, britain, sought, to, annex, east, africa, during, 1880, onwards, out, of, geo, strategic, concerns, connected, to, egypt, especially, the, suez, canal, has, been, challenged, by, historians, such, as, john, darwin, 1997, and, jonas, f, gjers, 2015, the, scramble, for, african, territory, also, reflected, concern, for, the, acquisition, of, military, and, naval, bases, for, strategic, purposes, and, the, exercise, of, power, the, growing, navies, and, new, ships, driven, by, steam, power, required, coaling, stations, and, ports, for, maintenance, defence, bases, were, also, needed, for, the, protection, of, sea, routes, and, communication, lines, particularly, of, expensive, and, vital, international, waterways, such, as, the, suez, canal, colonies, were, seen, as, assets, in, balance, of, power, negotiations, useful, as, items, of, exchange, at, times, of, international, bargaining, colonies, with, large, native, populations, were, also, a, source, of, military, power, britain, and, france, used, large, numbers, of, british, indian, and, north, african, soldiers, respectively, in, many, of, their, colonial, wars, and, would, do, so, again, in, the, coming, world, wars, in, the, age, of, nationalism, there, was, pressure, for, a, nation, to, acquire, an, empire, as, a, status, symbol, the, idea, of, greatness, became, linked, with, the, white, man, s, burden, or, sense, of, duty, underlying, many, nations, strategies, in, the, early, 1880s, pierre, savorgnan, de, brazza, was, exploring, the, region, along, the, congo, river, for, france, at, the, same, time, henry, morton, stanley, explored, it, on, behalf, of, the, committee, for, studies, of, the, upper, congo, backed, by, leopold, ii, of, belgium, who, would, have, it, as, his, personal, congo, free, state, leopold, had, earlier, hoped, to, recruit, pierre, savorgnan, de, brazza, but, turned, to, henry, morton, stanley, when, the, latter, was, recruited, by, the, french, government, france, occupied, tunisia, in, may, 1881, which, may, have, convinced, italy, to, join, the, german, austrian, dual, alliance, in, 1882, thus, forming, the, triple, alliance, the, same, year, britain, occupied, egypt, hitherto, an, autonomous, state, owing, nominal, fealty, to, the, ottoman, empire, which, ruled, over, sudan, and, parts, of, chad, eritrea, and, somalia, in, 1884, germany, declared, togoland, the, cameroons, and, south, west, africa, to, be, under, its, protection, and, france, occupied, guinea, french, west, africa, was, founded, in, 1895, and, french, equatorial, africa, in, 1910, in, french, somaliland, a, short, lived, russian, colony, in, the, egyptian, fort, of, sagallo, was, briefly, proclaimed, by, terek, cossacks, in, 1889, germany, divided, into, small, states, was, not, initially, a, colonial, power, in, 1862, otto, von, bismarck, became, minister, president, of, the, kingdom, of, prussia, and, through, a, series, of, wars, with, both, austria, in, 1866, and, france, in, 1870, was, able, to, unify, all, of, germany, under, prussian, rule, the, german, empire, was, formally, proclaimed, on, 18, january, 1871, at, first, bismarck, disliked, colonies, but, gave, in, to, popular, and, elite, pressure, in, the, 1880s, he, sponsored, the, 1884, 85, berlin, conference, which, set, the, rules, of, effective, control, of, african, territories, and, reduced, the, risk, of, conflict, between, colonial, powers, bismarck, used, private, companies, to, set, up, small, colonial, operations, in, africa, and, the, pacific, pan, germanism, became, linked, to, the, young, nation, s, new, imperialist, drives, in, the, beginning, of, the, 1880s, the, deutscher, kolonialverein, was, created, and, published, the, kolonialzeitung, this, colonial, lobby, was, also, relayed, by, the, nationalist, alldeutscher, verband, weltpolitik, world, policy, was, the, foreign, policy, adopted, by, kaiser, wilhelm, ii, in, 1890, intending, to, transform, germany, into, a, global, power, through, aggressive, diplomacy, and, the, development, of, a, large, navy, germany, became, the, third, largest, colonial, power, in, africa, the, location, of, most, of, its, 2, 6, million, square, kilometres, of, colonial, territory, and, 14, million, colonial, subjects, in, 1914, the, african, possessions, were, southwest, africa, togoland, the, cameroons, and, tanganyika, germany, tried, to, isolate, france, in, 1905, with, the, first, moroccan, crisis, this, led, to, the, 1905, algeciras, conference, in, which, france, s, influence, on, morocco, was, compensated, by, the, exchange, of, other, territories, and, then, to, the, agadir, crisis, in, 1911, after, fighting, alongside, france, during, the, crimean, war, 1853, 1856, the, kingdom, of, sardinia, sought, to, unify, the, italian, peninsula, with, french, support, following, a, war, with, austria, in, 1859, sardinia, under, the, leadership, of, giuseppe, garibaldi, was, able, to, unify, most, of, the, peninsula, by, 1861, establishing, the, kingdom, of, italy, following, unification, italy, sought, to, expand, its, territory, and, become, a, great, power, taking, possession, of, parts, of, eritrea, in, 1870, and, 1882, in, 1889, 90, it, occupied, territory, on, the, south, side, of, the, horn, of, africa, forming, what, would, become, italian, somaliland, in, the, disorder, that, followed, the, 1889, death, of, emperor, yohannes, iv, general, oreste, baratieri, occupied, the, ethiopian, highlands, along, the, eritrean, coast, and, italy, proclaimed, the, establishment, of, a, new, colony, of, eritrea, with, its, capital, moved, from, massawa, to, asmara, when, relations, between, italy, and, ethiopia, deteriorated, the, first, italo, ethiopian, war, broke, out, in, 1895, italian, troops, were, defeated, as, the, ethiopians, had, numerical, superiority, better, organization, and, support, from, russia, and, france, in, 1911, italy, engaged, in, a, war, with, the, ottoman, empire, in, which, it, acquired, tripolitania, and, cyrenaica, that, together, formed, what, became, known, as, italian, libya, in, 1919, enrico, corradini, developed, the, concept, of, proletarian, nationalism, which, was, supposed, to, legitimise, italy, s, imperialism, by, a, mixture, of, socialism, with, nationalism, we, must, start, by, recognizing, the, fact, that, there, are, proletarian, nations, as, well, as, proletarian, classes, that, is, to, say, there, are, nations, whose, living, conditions, are, subject, to, the, way, of, life, of, other, nations, just, as, classes, are, once, this, is, realised, nationalism, must, insist, firmly, on, this, truth, italy, is, materially, and, morally, a, proletarian, nation, the, second, italo, abyssinian, war, 1935, 1936, ordered, by, the, fascist, dictator, benito, mussolini, was, the, last, colonial, war, that, is, intended, to, colonise, a, country, as, opposed, to, wars, of, national, liberation, occupying, ethiopia, which, had, remained, the, last, independent, african, territory, apart, from, liberia, italian, ethiopia, was, occupied, by, fascist, italian, forces, in, world, war, ii, as, part, of, italian, east, africa, though, much, of, the, mountainous, countryside, had, remained, out, of, italian, control, due, to, resistance, from, the, arbegnoch, the, occupation, is, an, example, of, the, expansionist, policy, that, characterized, the, axis, powers, as, opposed, to, the, scramble, for, africa, david, livingstone, s, explorations, carried, on, by, henry, morton, stanley, excited, imaginations, with, stanley, s, grandiose, ideas, for, colonisation, but, these, found, little, support, owing, to, the, problems, and, scale, of, action, required, except, from, leopold, ii, of, belgium, who, in, 1876, had, organised, the, international, african, association, from, 1869, to, 1874, stanley, was, secretly, sent, by, leopold, ii, to, the, congo, region, where, he, made, treaties, with, several, african, chiefs, along, the, congo, river, and, by, 1882, had, sufficient, territory, to, form, the, basis, of, the, congo, free, state, while, stanley, was, exploring, the, congo, on, behalf, of, leopold, ii, of, belgium, the, franco, italian, marine, officer, pierre, de, brazza, travelled, into, the, western, congo, basin, and, raised, the, french, flag, over, the, newly, founded, brazzaville, in, 1881, thus, occupying, today, s, republic, of, the, congo, portugal, which, also, claimed, the, area, because, of, old, treaties, with, the, kingdom, of, kongo, made, a, treaty, with, britain, on, 26, february, 1884, to, block, off, leopold, s, access, to, the, atlantic, by, 1890, the, congo, free, state, had, consolidated, control, of, its, territory, between, leopoldville, and, stanleyville, and, was, looking, to, push, south, down, the, lualaba, river, from, stanleyville, at, the, same, time, the, british, south, africa, company, of, cecil, rhodes, was, expanding, north, from, the, limpopo, river, sending, the, pioneer, column, guided, by, frederick, selous, through, matabeleland, and, starting, a, colony, in, mashonaland, tippu, tip, a, zanzibari, arab, based, in, the, sultanate, of, zanzibar, also, played, a, major, role, as, a, protector, of, european, explorers, ivory, trader, and, slave, trader, having, established, a, trading, empire, within, zanzibar, and, neighbouring, areas, in, east, africa, tippu, tip, would, shift, his, alignment, towards, the, rising, colonial, powers, in, the, region, and, at, the, proposal, of, henry, morton, stanley, tippu, tip, became, a, governor, of, the, stanley, falls, district, boyoma, falls, in, leopold, s, congo, free, state, before, being, involved, in, the, congo, arab, war, against, leopold, ii, s, colonial, state, to, the, west, in, the, land, where, their, expansions, would, meet, was, katanga, the, site, of, the, yeke, kingdom, of, msiri, msiri, was, the, most, militarily, powerful, ruler, in, the, area, and, traded, large, quantities, of, copper, ivory, and, slaves, and, rumours, of, gold, reached, european, ears, the, scramble, for, katanga, was, a, prime, example, of, the, period, rhodes, sent, two, expeditions, to, msiri, in, 1890, led, by, alfred, sharpe, who, was, rebuffed, and, joseph, thomson, who, failed, to, reach, katanga, leopold, sent, four, expeditions, first, the, le, marinel, expedition, could, only, extract, a, vaguely, worded, letter, the, delcommune, expedition, was, rebuffed, the, well, armed, stairs, expedition, was, given, orders, to, take, katanga, with, or, without, msiri, s, consent, msiri, refused, was, shot, and, his, head, was, cut, off, and, stuck, on, a, pole, as, a, barbaric, lesson, to, the, people, the, bia, river, expedition, finished, the, job, of, establishing, an, administration, of, sorts, and, a, police, presence, in, katanga, thus, the, half, million, square, kilometres, of, katanga, came, into, leopold, s, possession, and, brought, his, african, realm, up, to, 2, 300, 000, square, kilometres, 890, 000, sq, mi, about, 75, times, larger, than, belgium, the, congo, free, state, imposed, such, a, terror, regime, on, the, colonized, people, including, mass, killings, and, forced, labour, that, belgium, under, pressure, from, the, congo, reform, association, ended, leopold, ii, s, rule, and, annexed, it, on, 20, august, 1908, as, a, colony, of, belgium, known, as, the, belgian, congo, the, brutality, of, king, leopold, ii, in, his, former, colony, of, the, congo, free, state, was, well, documented, up, to, 8, million, of, the, estimated, 16, million, native, inhabitants, died, between, 1885, and, 1908, according, to, roger, casement, an, irish, diplomat, of, the, time, this, depopulation, had, four, main, causes, indiscriminate, war, starvation, reduction, of, births, and, diseases, sleeping, sickness, ravaged, the, country, and, must, also, be, taken, into, account, for, the, dramatic, decrease, in, population, it, has, been, estimated, that, sleeping, sickness, and, smallpox, killed, nearly, half, the, population, in, the, areas, surrounding, the, lower, congo, river, estimates, of, the, death, toll, vary, considerably, as, the, first, census, did, not, take, place, until, 1924, it, is, difficult, to, quantify, the, population, loss, of, the, period, the, casement, report, set, it, at, three, million, william, rubinstein, writes, more, basically, it, appears, almost, certain, that, the, population, figures, given, by, hochschild, are, inaccurate, there, is, of, course, no, way, of, ascertaining, the, population, of, the, congo, before, the, twentieth, century, and, estimates, like, 20, million, are, purely, guesses, most, of, the, interior, of, the, congo, was, literally, unexplored, if, not, inaccessible, a, similar, situation, occurred, in, the, neighbouring, french, congo, where, most, of, the, resource, extraction, was, run, by, concession, companies, whose, brutal, methods, along, with, the, introduction, of, disease, resulted, in, the, loss, of, up, to, 50, of, the, indigenous, population, according, to, hochschild, the, french, government, appointed, a, commission, headed, by, de, brazza, in, 1905, to, investigate, the, rumoured, abuses, in, the, colony, however, de, brazza, died, on, the, return, trip, and, his, searingly, critical, report, was, neither, acted, upon, nor, released, to, the, public, in, the, 1920s, about, 20, 000, forced, labourers, died, building, a, railroad, through, the, french, territory, to, construct, the, suez, canal, french, diplomat, ferdinand, de, lesseps, had, obtained, many, concessions, from, isma, il, pasha, the, khedive, of, egypt, and, sudan, in, 1854, 56, some, sources, estimate, the, workforce, at, 30, 000, but, others, estimate, that, 120, 000, workers, died, over, the, ten, years, of, construction, from, malnutrition, fatigue, and, disease, especially, cholera, shortly, before, its, completion, in, 1869, khedive, isma, il, borrowed, enormous, sums, from, british, and, french, bankers, at, high, rates, of, interest, by, 1875, he, was, facing, financial, difficulties, and, was, forced, to, sell, his, block, of, shares, in, the, suez, canal, the, shares, were, snapped, up, by, britain, under, prime, minister, benjamin, disraeli, who, sought, to, give, his, country, practical, control, in, the, management, of, this, strategic, waterway, when, isma, il, repudiated, egypt, s, foreign, debt, in, 1879, britain, and, france, seized, joint, financial, control, over, the, country, forcing, the, egyptian, ruler, to, abdicate, and, installing, his, eldest, son, tewfik, pasha, in, his, place, the, egyptian, and, sudanese, ruling, classes, did, not, relish, foreign, intervention, during, the, 1870s, european, initiatives, against, the, slave, trade, caused, an, economic, crisis, in, northern, sudan, precipitating, the, rise, of, mahdist, forces, in, 1881, the, mahdist, revolt, erupted, in, sudan, under, muhammad, ahmad, severing, tewfik, s, authority, in, sudan, the, same, year, tewfik, suffered, an, even, more, perilous, rebellion, by, his, egyptian, army, in, the, form, of, the, urabi, revolt, in, 1882, tewfik, appealed, for, direct, british, military, assistance, commencing, britain, s, administration, of, egypt, a, joint, british, egyptian, military, force, entered, the, mahdist, war, additionally, the, egyptian, province, of, equatoria, located, in, south, sudan, led, by, emin, pasha, was, also, subject, to, an, ostensible, relief, expedition, of, emin, pasha, against, mahdist, forces, the, british, egyptian, force, ultimately, defeated, the, mahdist, forces, in, sudan, in, 1898, thereafter, britain, seized, effective, control, of, sudan, which, was, nominally, called, anglo, egyptian, sudan, the, occupation, of, egypt, and, the, acquisition, of, the, congo, were, the, first, major, moves, in, what, came, to, be, a, precipitous, scramble, for, african, territory, in, 1884, otto, von, bismarck, convened, the, 1884, 1885, berlin, conference, to, discuss, the, african, problem, while, diplomatic, discussions, were, held, regarding, ending, the, remaining, slave, trade, as, well, as, the, reach, of, missionary, activities, the, primary, concern, of, those, in, attendance, was, preventing, war, between, the, european, powers, as, they, divided, the, continent, among, themselves, more, importantly, the, diplomats, in, berlin, laid, down, the, rules, of, competition, by, which, the, great, powers, were, to, be, guided, in, seeking, colonies, they, also, agreed, that, the, area, along, the, congo, river, was, to, be, administered, by, leopold, ii, as, a, neutral, area, in, which, trade, and, navigation, were, to, be, free, no, nation, was, to, stake, claims, in, africa, without, notifying, other, powers, of, its, intentions, no, territory, could, be, formally, claimed, before, being, effectively, occupied, however, the, competitors, ignored, the, rules, when, convenient, and, on, several, occasions, war, was, only, narrowly, avoided, see, fashoda, incident, the, swahili, coast, territories, of, the, sultanate, of, zanzibar, were, partitioned, between, germany, and, britain, initially, leaving, the, archipelago, of, zanzibar, independent, until, 1890, when, that, remnant, of, the, sultanate, was, made, into, a, british, protectorate, with, the, heligoland, zanzibar, treaty, britain, s, administration, of, egypt, and, the, cape, colony, contributed, to, a, preoccupation, over, securing, the, source, of, the, nile, river, egypt, was, taken, over, by, the, british, in, 1882, leaving, the, ottoman, empire, in, a, nominal, role, until, 1914, when, london, made, it, a, protectorate, egypt, was, never, an, actual, british, colony, sudan, nigeria, kenya, and, uganda, were, subjugated, in, the, 1890s, and, early, 20th, century, and, in, the, south, the, cape, colony, first, acquired, in, 1795, provided, a, base, for, the, subjugation, of, neighbouring, african, states, and, the, dutch, afrikaner, settlers, who, had, left, the, cape, to, avoid, the, british, and, then, founded, their, republics, theophilus, shepstone, annexed, the, south, african, republic, in, 1877, for, the, british, empire, after, it, had, been, independent, for, twenty, years, in, 1879, after, the, anglo, zulu, war, britain, consolidated, its, control, of, most, of, the, territories, of, south, africa, the, boers, protested, and, in, december, 1880, they, revolted, leading, to, the, first, boer, war, british, prime, minister, william, gladstone, signed, a, peace, treaty, on, 23, march, 1881, giving, self, government, to, the, boers, in, the, transvaal, the, jameson, raid, of, 1895, was, a, failed, attempt, by, the, british, south, africa, company, and, the, johannesburg, reform, committee, to, overthrow, the, boer, government, in, the, transvaal, the, second, boer, war, fought, between, 1899, and, 1902, was, about, control, of, the, gold, and, diamond, industries, the, independent, boer, republics, of, the, orange, free, state, and, the, south, african, republic, were, this, time, defeated, and, absorbed, into, the, british, empire, the, french, thrust, into, the, african, interior, was, mainly, from, the, coasts, of, west, africa, present, day, senegal, eastward, through, the, sahel, along, the, southern, border, of, the, sahara, their, ultimate, aim, was, to, have, an, uninterrupted, colonial, empire, from, the, niger, river, to, the, nile, thus, controlling, all, trade, to, and, from, the, sahel, region, by, their, existing, control, over, the, caravan, routes, through, the, sahara, the, british, on, the, other, hand, wanted, to, link, their, possessions, in, southern, africa, with, their, territories, in, east, africa, and, these, two, areas, with, the, nile, basin, the, sudan, which, included, most, of, present, day, uganda, was, the, key, to, the, fulfilment, of, these, ambitions, especially, since, egypt, was, already, under, british, control, this, red, line, through, africa, is, made, most, famous, by, cecil, rhodes, along, with, lord, milner, the, british, colonial, minister, in, south, africa, rhodes, advocated, such, a, cape, to, cairo, empire, linking, the, suez, canal, to, the, mineral, rich, south, africa, by, rail, though, hampered, by, the, german, occupation, of, tanganyika, until, the, end, of, world, war, i, rhodes, successfully, lobbied, on, behalf, of, such, a, sprawling, african, empire, britain, had, sought, to, extend, its, east, african, empire, contiguously, from, cairo, to, the, cape, of, good, hope, while, france, had, sought, to, extend, its, holdings, from, dakar, to, the, sudan, which, would, enable, its, empire, to, span, the, entire, continent, from, the, atlantic, ocean, to, the, red, sea, if, one, draws, a, line, from, cape, town, to, cairo, rhodes, s, dream, and, one, from, dakar, to, the, horn, of, africa, the, french, ambition, these, two, lines, intersect, somewhere, in, eastern, sudan, near, fashoda, explaining, its, strategic, importance, a, french, force, under, jean, baptiste, marchand, arrived, first, at, the, strategically, located, fort, at, fashoda, soon, followed, by, a, british, force, under, lord, kitchener, commander, in, chief, of, the, british, army, since, 1892, the, french, withdrew, after, a, standoff, and, continued, to, press, claims, to, other, posts, in, the, region, the, fashoda, incident, ultimately, led, to, the, signature, of, the, entente, cordiale, of, 1904, which, guaranteed, peace, between, the, two, in, 1890, both, the, united, kingdom, and, france, were, able, to, reach, a, diplomatic, solution, over, a, colonial, dispute, that, would, guarantee, freedom, of, trade, for, the, british, empire, while, allowing, france, to, expand, their, influence, in, north, africa, in, exchange, for, france, recognizing, britain, s, protectorate, over, zanzibar, the, british, empire, recognized, france, s, claim, to, madagascar, as, well, as, their, sphere, of, influence, in, north, africa, stretching, down, to, the, border, region, of, sokoto, however, finely, demarcating, this, border, was, difficult, to, do, without, a, large, map, although, the, berlin, conference, had, set, the, rules, for, the, scramble, for, africa, it, had, not, weakened, the, rival, imperialists, as, a, result, of, the, entente, cordiale, the, german, kaiser, decided, to, test, the, solidity, of, such, influence, using, the, contested, territory, of, morocco, as, a, battlefield, kaiser, wilhelm, ii, visited, tangier, on, 31, march, 1905, and, made, a, speech, in, favour, of, moroccan, independence, challenging, french, influence, in, morocco, france, s, presence, had, been, reaffirmed, by, britain, and, spain, in, 1904, the, kaiser, s, speech, bolstered, french, nationalism, and, with, british, support, the, french, foreign, minister, th, ophile, delcass, took, a, defiant, line, the, crisis, peaked, in, mid, june, 1905, when, delcass, was, forced, out, of, the, ministry, by, the, more, conciliation, minded, premier, maurice, rouvier, but, by, july, 1905, germany, was, becoming, isolated, and, the, french, agreed, to, a, conference, to, solve, the, crisis, the, 1906, algeciras, conference, was, called, to, settle, the, dispute, of, the, thirteen, nations, present, the, german, representatives, found, their, only, supporter, was, austria, hungary, which, had, no, interest, in, africa, france, had, firm, support, from, britain, the, u, s, russia, italy, and, spain, the, germans, eventually, accepted, an, agreement, signed, on, 31, may, 1906, whereby, france, yielded, certain, domestic, changes, in, morocco, but, retained, control, of, key, areas, however, five, years, later, the, second, moroccan, crisis, or, agadir, crisis, was, sparked, by, the, deployment, of, the, german, gunboat, panther, to, the, port, of, agadir, in, july, 1911, germany, had, started, to, attempt, to, match, britain, s, naval, supremacy, the, british, navy, had, a, policy, of, remaining, larger, than, the, next, two, rival, fleets, in, the, world, combined, when, the, british, heard, of, the, panther, s, arrival, in, morocco, they, wrongly, believed, that, the, germans, meant, to, turn, agadir, into, a, naval, base, on, the, atlantic, the, german, move, was, aimed, at, reinforcing, claims, for, compensation, for, acceptance, of, effective, french, control, of, the, north, african, kingdom, where, france, s, pre, eminence, had, been, upheld, by, the, 1906, algeciras, conference, in, november, 1911, a, compromise, was, reached, under, which, germany, accepted, france, s, position, in, morocco, in, return, for, a, slice, of, territory, in, the, french, equatorial, african, colony, of, middle, congo, france, and, spain, subsequently, established, a, full, protectorate, over, morocco, on, 30, march, 1912, ending, what, remained, of, the, country, s, formal, independence, furthermore, british, backing, for, france, during, the, two, moroccan, crises, reinforced, the, entente, between, the, two, countries, and, added, to, anglo, german, estrangement, deepening, the, divisions, that, would, culminate, in, the, first, world, war, following, the, berlin, conference, the, british, italians, and, ethiopians, sought, to, claim, lands, inhabited, by, the, somalis, the, dervish, movement, led, by, sayid, muhammed, abdullah, hassan, existed, for, 21, years, from, 1899, until, 1920, the, dervish, movement, successfully, repulsed, the, british, empire, four, times, and, forced, it, to, retreat, to, the, coastal, region, because, of, these, successful, expeditions, the, dervish, movement, was, recognized, as, an, ally, by, the, ottoman, and, german, empires, the, turks, named, hassan, emir, of, the, somali, nation, and, the, germans, promised, to, officially, recognise, any, territories, the, dervishes, were, to, acquire, after, a, quarter, of, a, century, of, holding, the, british, at, bay, the, dervishes, were, finally, defeated, in, 1920, as, a, direct, consequence, of, britain, s, use, of, aircraft, between, 1904, and, 1908, germany, s, colonies, in, german, south, west, africa, and, german, east, africa, were, rocked, by, separate, contemporaneous, native, revolts, against, their, rule, in, both, territories, the, threat, to, german, rule, was, quickly, defeated, once, large, scale, reinforcements, from, germany, arrived, with, the, herero, rebels, in, german, south, west, africa, being, defeated, at, the, battle, of, waterberg, and, the, maji, maji, rebels, in, german, east, africa, being, steadily, crushed, by, german, forces, slowly, advancing, through, the, countryside, with, the, natives, resorting, to, guerrilla, warfare, german, efforts, to, clear, the, bush, of, civilians, in, german, south, west, africa, resulted, in, a, genocide, of, the, population, in, total, as, many, as, 65, 000, herero, 80, of, the, total, herero, population, and, 10, 000, namaqua, 50, of, the, total, namaqua, population, either, starved, died, of, thirst, or, were, worked, to, death, in, camps, such, as, shark, island, concentration, camp, between, 1904, and, 1908, between, 24, 000, and, 100, 000, hereros, 10, 000, nama, and, an, unknown, number, of, san, died, in, the, genocide, characteristic, of, this, genocide, was, death, from, starvation, thirst, and, possibly, the, poisoning, of, the, population, s, wells, whilst, they, were, trapped, in, the, namib, desert, in, its, earlier, stages, imperialism, was, generally, the, act, of, individual, explorers, as, well, as, some, adventurous, merchantmen, the, colonial, powers, were, a, long, way, from, approving, without, any, dissent, the, expensive, adventures, carried, out, abroad, various, important, political, leaders, such, as, william, gladstone, opposed, colonization, in, its, first, years, however, during, his, second, premiership, between, 1880, and, 1885, he, could, not, resist, the, colonial, lobby, in, his, cabinet, and, thus, did, not, execute, his, electoral, promise, to, disengage, from, egypt, although, gladstone, was, personally, opposed, to, imperialism, the, social, tensions, caused, by, the, long, depression, pushed, him, to, favour, jingoism, the, imperialists, had, become, the, parasites, of, patriotism, in, france, radical, politician, georges, clemenceau, was, adamantly, opposed, to, it, he, thought, colonization, was, a, diversion, from, the, blue, line, of, the, vosges, mountains, that, is, revanchism, and, the, patriotic, urge, to, reclaim, the, alsace, lorraine, region, which, had, been, annexed, by, the, german, empire, with, the, 1871, treaty, of, frankfurt, clemenceau, made, jules, ferry, s, cabinet, fall, after, the, 1885, tonkin, disaster, according, to, hannah, arendt, in, the, origins, of, totalitarianism, 1951, this, expansion, of, national, sovereignty, on, overseas, territories, contradicted, the, unity, of, the, nation, state, which, provided, citizenship, to, its, population, thus, a, tension, between, the, universalist, will, respect, human, rights, of, the, colonized, people, as, they, may, be, considered, as, citizens, of, the, nation, state, and, the, imperialist, drive, to, cynically, exploit, populations, deemed, inferior, began, to, surface, some, in, colonizing, countries, opposed, what, they, saw, as, unnecessary, evils, of, the, colonial, administration, when, left, to, itself, as, described, in, joseph, conrad, s, heart, of, darkness, 1899, published, around, the, same, time, as, kipling, s, the, white, man, s, burden,

brought, about, by, the, colonial, propaganda, supported, by, the, colonial, lobby, and, by, various, scientists, thus, conquests, of, territories, were, inevitably, followed, by, public, displays, of, the, indigenous, people, for, scientific, and, leisure, purposes, carl, hagenbeck, a, german, merchant, in, wild, animals, and, a, future, entrepreneur, of, most, europeans, zoos, decided, in,
