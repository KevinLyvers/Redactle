chronological, history, the, viking, age, about, 800, 1050, ce, was, the, period, during, the, middle, ages, when, norsemen, known, as, vikings, undertook, large, scale, raiding, colonising, conquest, and, trading, throughout, europe, and, reached, north, america, the, viking, age, applies, not, only, to, their, homeland, of, scandinavia, but, also, to, any, place, significantly, settled, by, scandinavians, during, the, period, the, scandinavians, of, the, viking, age, are, often, referred, to, as, vikings, as, well, as, norsemen, although, few, of, them, were, vikings, in, the, sense, of, being, engaged, in, piracy, voyaging, by, sea, from, their, homelands, in, denmark, norway, and, sweden, the, norse, people, settled, in, the, british, isles, ireland, the, faroe, islands, iceland, greenland, normandy, and, the, baltic, coast, and, along, the, dnieper, and, volga, trade, routes, in, eastern, europe, where, they, were, also, known, as, varangians, they, also, briefly, settled, in, newfoundland, becoming, the, first, europeans, to, reach, north, america, the, norse, gaels, normans, rus, people, faroese, and, icelanders, emerged, from, these, norse, colonies, the, vikings, founded, several, kingdoms, and, earldoms, in, europe, the, kingdom, of, the, isles, su, reyjar, orkney, nor, reyjar, york, j, rv, k, and, the, danelaw, danal, g, dublin, dyflin, normandy, and, kievan, rus, gar, ar, ki, the, norse, homelands, were, also, unified, into, larger, kingdoms, during, the, viking, age, and, the, short, lived, north, sea, empire, included, large, swathes, of, scandinavia, and, britain, in, 1021, the, vikings, achieved, the, feat, of, reaching, north, america, the, date, of, which, was, not, determined, until, a, millennium, later, several, things, drove, this, expansion, the, vikings, were, drawn, by, the, growth, of, wealthy, towns, and, monasteries, overseas, and, weak, kingdoms, they, may, also, have, been, pushed, to, leave, their, homeland, by, overpopulation, lack, of, good, farmland, and, political, strife, arising, from, the, unification, of, norway, the, aggressive, expansion, of, the, carolingian, empire, and, forced, conversion, of, the, neighbouring, saxons, to, christianity, may, also, have, been, a, factor, sailing, innovations, had, allowed, the, vikings, to, sail, farther, and, longer, to, begin, with, information, about, the, viking, age, is, drawn, largely, from, primary, sources, written, by, those, the, vikings, encountered, as, well, as, archaeology, supplemented, with, secondary, sources, such, as, the, icelandic, sagas, in, england, the, viking, attack, of, 8, june, 793, that, destroyed, the, abbey, on, lindisfarne, a, centre, of, learning, on, an, island, off, the, northeast, coast, of, england, in, northumberland, is, regarded, as, the, beginning, of, the, viking, age, judith, jesch, has, argued, that, the, start, of, the, viking, age, can, be, pushed, back, to, 700, 750, as, it, was, unlikely, that, the, lindisfarne, attack, was, the, first, attack, and, given, archeological, evidence, that, suggests, contacts, between, scandinavia, and, the, british, isles, earlier, in, the, century, the, earliest, raids, were, most, likely, small, in, scale, but, expanded, in, scale, during, the, 9th, century, in, the, lindisfarne, attack, monks, were, killed, in, the, abbey, thrown, into, the, sea, to, drown, or, carried, away, as, slaves, along, with, the, church, treasures, giving, rise, to, the, traditional, but, unattested, prayer, a, furore, normannorum, libera, nos, domine, free, us, from, the, fury, of, the, northmen, lord, three, viking, ships, had, beached, in, weymouth, bay, four, years, earlier, although, due, to, a, scribal, error, the, anglo, saxon, chronicle, dates, this, event, to, 787, rather, than, 789, but, that, incursion, may, have, been, a, trading, expedition, that, went, wrong, rather, than, a, piratical, raid, lindisfarne, was, different, the, viking, devastation, of, northumbria, s, holy, island, was, reported, by, the, northumbrian, scholar, alcuin, of, york, who, wrote, never, before, in, britain, has, such, a, terror, appeared, vikings, were, portrayed, as, wholly, violent, and, bloodthirsty, by, their, enemies, robert, of, gloucester, s, chronicle, c, 1300, mentions, viking, attacks, on, the, people, of, east, anglia, wherein, they, are, described, as, wolves, among, sheep, the, first, challenges, to, the, many, negative, depictions, of, vikings, in, britain, emerged, in, the, 17th, century, pioneering, scholarly, works, on, the, viking, age, reached, only, a, small, readership, there, while, linguists, traced, the, viking, age, origins, of, rural, idioms, and, proverbs, new, dictionaries, and, grammars, of, the, old, icelandic, language, appeared, enabling, more, victorian, scholars, to, read, the, primary, texts, of, the, icelandic, sagas, in, scandinavia, the, 17th, century, danish, scholars, thomas, bartholin, and, ole, worm, and, swedish, scholar, olaus, rudbeck, were, the, first, to, use, runic, inscriptions, and, icelandic, sagas, as, primary, historical, sources, during, the, enlightenment, and, nordic, renaissance, historians, such, as, the, icelandic, norwegian, thormodus, torf, us, danish, norwegian, ludvig, holberg, and, swedish, olof, von, dalin, developed, a, more, rational, and, pragmatic, approach, to, historical, scholarship, by, the, latter, half, of, the, 18th, century, while, the, icelandic, sagas, were, still, used, as, important, historical, sources, the, viking, age, had, again, come, to, be, regarded, as, a, barbaric, and, uncivilised, period, in, the, history, of, the, nordic, countries, scholars, outside, scandinavia, did, not, begin, to, extensively, reassess, the, achievements, of, the, vikings, until, the, 1890s, recognising, their, artistry, technological, skills, and, seamanship, the, vikings, who, invaded, western, and, eastern, europe, were, mainly, pagans, from, the, same, area, as, present, day, denmark, norway, and, sweden, they, also, settled, in, the, faroe, islands, ireland, iceland, peripheral, scotland, caithness, the, hebrides, and, the, northern, isles, greenland, and, canada, their, north, germanic, language, old, norse, became, the, precursor, to, present, day, scandinavian, languages, by, 801, a, strong, central, authority, appears, to, have, been, established, in, jutland, and, the, danes, were, beginning, to, look, beyond, their, own, territory, for, land, trade, and, plunder, in, norway, mountainous, terrain, and, fjords, formed, strong, natural, boundaries, communities, remained, independent, of, each, other, unlike, the, situation, in, lowland, denmark, by, 800, some, 30, small, kingdoms, existed, in, norway, the, sea, was, the, easiest, way, of, communication, between, the, norwegian, kingdoms, and, the, outside, world, in, the, eighth, century, scandinavians, began, to, build, ships, of, war, and, send, them, on, raiding, expeditions, which, started, the, viking, age, the, north, sea, rovers, were, traders, colonisers, explorers, and, plunderers, who, were, notorious, in, england, scotland, ireland, wales, and, other, places, in, europe, for, being, brutal, many, theories, are, posited, for, the, cause, of, the, viking, invasions, the, will, to, explore, likely, played, a, major, role, at, the, time, england, wales, and, ireland, were, vulnerable, to, attack, being, divided, into, many, different, warring, kingdoms, in, a, state, of, internal, disarray, while, the, franks, were, well, defended, overpopulation, especially, near, the, scandes, was, a, possible, reason, although, some, disagree, with, this, theory, technological, advances, like, the, use, of, iron, and, a, shortage, of, women, due, to, selective, female, infanticide, also, likely, had, an, impact, tensions, caused, by, frankish, expansion, to, the, south, of, scandinavia, and, their, subsequent, attacks, upon, the, viking, peoples, may, have, also, played, a, role, in, viking, pillaging, harald, i, of, norway, harald, fairhair, had, united, norway, around, this, time, and, displaced, many, peoples, as, a, result, these, people, sought, for, new, bases, to, launch, counter, raids, against, harald, debate, among, scholars, is, ongoing, as, to, why, the, scandinavians, began, to, expand, from, the, eighth, through, 11th, centuries, various, factors, have, been, highlighted, demographic, economic, ideological, political, technological, and, environmental, models, this, model, suggests, that, scandinavia, experienced, population, growth, just, before, the, viking, age, began, the, agricultural, capacity, of, the, land, was, not, enough, to, keep, up, with, the, increasing, population, as, a, result, many, scandinavians, found, themselves, with, no, property, and, no, status, to, remedy, this, these, landless, men, took, to, piracy, to, obtain, material, wealth, the, population, continued, to, grow, and, the, pirates, looked, further, and, further, beyond, the, borders, of, the, baltic, and, eventually, into, all, of, europe, historian, anders, winroth, has, challenged, the, overpopulation, thesis, arguing, that, scholars, are, simply, repeating, an, ancient, clich, that, has, no, basis, in, fact, the, economic, model, states, that, the, viking, age, was, the, result, of, growing, urbanism, and, trade, throughout, mainland, europe, as, the, islamic, world, grew, so, did, its, trade, routes, and, the, wealth, which, moved, along, them, was, pushed, further, and, further, north, in, western, europe, proto, urban, centres, such, as, the, wich, towns, of, anglo, saxon, england, began, to, boom, during, the, prosperous, era, known, as, the, long, eighth, century, the, scandinavians, like, many, other, europeans, were, drawn, to, these, wealthier, urban, centres, which, soon, became, frequent, targets, of, viking, raids, the, connection, of, the, scandinavians, to, larger, and, richer, trade, networks, lured, the, vikings, into, western, europe, and, soon, the, rest, of, europe, and, parts, of, the, middle, east, in, england, hoards, of, viking, silver, such, as, the, cuerdale, hoard, and, the, vale, of, york, hoard, offer, good, insight, to, this, phenomenon, critics, of, this, model, argue, that, the, earliest, recorded, viking, raids, were, in, western, norway, and, northern, britain, which, were, not, highly, economically, integrated, areas, alternative, versions, of, the, economic, model, point, to, economic, incentives, that, stemmed, from, youth, bulges, as, young, men, were, driven, to, maritime, activity, due, to, limited, economic, alternatives, this, era, coincided, with, the, medieval, warm, period, 800, 1300, and, stopped, with, the, start, of, the, little, ice, age, about, 1250, 1850, the, start, of, the, viking, age, with, the, sack, of, lindisfarne, also, coincided, with, charlemagne, s, saxon, wars, or, christian, wars, with, pagans, in, saxony, bruno, dum, zil, theorises, that, the, viking, attacks, may, have, been, in, response, to, the, spread, of, christianity, among, pagan, peoples, because, of, the, penetration, of, christianity, in, scandinavia, serious, conflict, divided, norway, for, almost, a, century, the, first, of, two, main, components, to, the, political, model, is, the, external, pull, factor, which, suggests, that, the, weak, political, bodies, of, britain, and, western, europe, made, for, an, attractive, target, for, viking, raiders, the, reasons, for, these, weaknesses, vary, but, generally, can, be, simplified, into, decentralised, polities, or, religious, sites, as, a, result, viking, raiders, found, it, easy, to, sack, and, then, retreat, from, these, areas, which, were, thus, frequently, raided, the, second, case, is, the, internal, push, factor, which, coincides, with, a, period, just, before, the, viking, age, in, which, scandinavia, was, undergoing, a, mass, centralisation, of, power, in, the, modern, day, countries, of, denmark, sweden, and, especially, norway, this, centralization, of, power, forced, hundreds, of, chieftains, from, their, lands, which, were, slowly, being, eaten, up, by, the, kings, and, dynasties, that, began, to, emerge, as, a, result, many, of, these, chiefs, sought, refuge, elsewhere, and, began, harrying, the, coasts, of, the, british, isles, and, western, europe, anders, winroth, argues, that, purposeful, choices, by, warlords, propelled, the, viking, age, movement, of, people, from, scandinavia, these, models, constitute, much, of, what, is, known, about, the, motivations, for, and, the, causes, of, the, viking, age, in, all, likelihood, the, beginning, of, this, age, was, the, result, of, some, combination, of, the, aforementioned, hypotheses, the, viking, colonisation, of, islands, in, the, north, atlantic, has, in, part, been, attributed, to, a, period, of, favourable, climate, the, medieval, climactic, optimum, as, the, weather, was, relatively, stable, and, predictable, with, calm, seas, sea, ice, was, rare, harvests, were, typically, strong, and, fishing, conditions, were, good, the, earliest, date, given, for, the, coming, of, vikings, to, england, is, 789, during, the, reign, of, king, beorhtric, of, wessex, according, to, the, anglo, saxon, chronicle, three, norwegian, boats, from, hordaland, old, norse, h, r, alandi, landed, at, the, isle, of, portland, off, the, coast, of, dorset, they, apparently, were, mistaken, for, merchants, by, a, royal, official, beaduhard, a, king, s, reeve, who, attempted, to, force, them, to, come, to, the, king, s, manor, whereupon, they, killed, the, reeve, and, his, men, the, beginning, of, the, viking, age, in, the, british, isles, is, often, set, at, 793, it, was, recorded, in, the, anglo, saxon, chronicle, that, the, northmen, raided, the, important, island, monastery, of, lindisfarne, the, generally, accepted, date, is, actually, 8, june, not, january, a, d, 793, this, year, came, dreadful, fore, warnings, over, the, land, of, the, northumbrians, terrifying, the, people, most, woefully, these, were, immense, sheets, of, light, rushing, through, the, air, and, whirlwinds, and, fiery, dragons, flying, across, the, firmament, these, tremendous, tokens, were, soon, followed, by, a, great, famine, and, not, long, after, on, the, sixth, day, before, the, ides, of, january, in, the, same, year, the, harrowing, inroads, of, heathen, men, made, lamentable, havoc, in, the, church, of, god, in, holy, island, lindisfarne, by, rapine, and, slaughter, in, 794, according, to, the, annals, of, ulster, a, serious, attack, was, made, on, lindisfarne, s, mother, house, of, iona, which, was, followed, in, 795, by, raids, upon, the, northern, coast, of, ireland, from, bases, there, the, norsemen, attacked, iona, again, in, 802, causing, great, slaughter, amongst, the, c, li, d, brethren, and, burning, the, abbey, to, the, ground, the, vikings, primarily, targeted, ireland, until, 830, as, england, and, the, carolingian, empire, were, able, to, fight, the, vikings, off, however, after, 830, ce, the, vikings, had, considerable, success, against, england, the, carolingian, empire, and, other, parts, of, western, europe, after, 830, the, vikings, exploited, disunity, within, the, carolingian, empire, as, well, as, pitting, the, english, kingdoms, against, each, other, the, kingdom, of, the, franks, under, charlemagne, was, particularly, devastated, by, these, raiders, who, could, sail, up, the, seine, with, near, impunity, near, the, end, of, charlemagne, s, reign, and, throughout, the, reigns, of, his, sons, and, grandsons, a, string, of, norse, raids, began, culminating, in, a, gradual, scandinavian, conquest, and, settlement, of, the, region, now, known, as, normandy, in, 911, frankish, king, charles, the, simple, granted, the, duchy, of, normandy, to, viking, warleader, rollo, a, chieftain, of, disputed, norwegian, or, danish, origins, in, order, to, stave, off, attacks, by, other, vikings, charles, gave, rollo, the, title, of, duke, in, return, rollo, swore, fealty, to, charles, converted, to, christianity, and, undertook, to, defend, the, northern, region, of, france, against, the, incursions, of, other, viking, groups, several, generations, later, the, norman, descendants, of, these, viking, settlers, not, only, identified, themselves, as, norman, but, also, carried, the, norman, language, either, a, french, dialect, or, a, romance, language, which, can, be, classified, as, one, of, the, o, l, languages, along, with, french, picard, and, walloon, and, their, norman, culture, into, england, in, 1066, with, the, norman, conquest, they, became, the, ruling, aristocracy, of, anglo, saxon, england, the, clinker, built, longships, used, by, the, scandinavians, were, uniquely, suited, to, both, deep, and, shallow, waters, they, extended, the, reach, of, norse, raiders, traders, and, settlers, along, coastlines, and, along, the, major, river, valleys, of, north, western, europe, rurik, also, expanded, to, the, east, and, in, 859, became, ruler, either, by, conquest, or, invitation, by, local, people, of, the, city, of, novgorod, which, means, new, city, on, the, volkhov, river, his, successors, moved, further, founding, the, early, east, slavic, state, of, kievan, rus, with, the, capital, in, kiev, this, persisted, until, 1240, when, the, mongols, invaded, kievan, rus, other, norse, people, continued, south, to, the, black, sea, and, then, on, to, constantinople, the, eastern, connections, of, these, varangians, brought, byzantine, silk, a, cowrie, shell, from, the, red, sea, and, even, coins, from, samarkand, to, viking, york, in, 884, an, army, of, danish, vikings, was, defeated, at, the, battle, of, norditi, also, called, the, battle, of, hilgenried, bay, on, the, germanic, north, sea, coast, by, a, frisian, army, under, archbishop, rimbert, of, bremen, hamburg, which, precipitated, the, complete, and, permanent, withdrawal, of, the, vikings, from, east, frisia, in, the, 10th, and, 11th, centuries, saxons, and, slavs, began, to, use, trained, mobile, cavalry, successfully, against, viking, foot, soldiers, making, it, hard, for, viking, invaders, to, fight, inland, in, scandinavia, the, viking, age, is, considered, by, some, scholars, to, have, ended, with, the, establishment, of, royal, authority, and, the, establishment, of, christianity, as, the, dominant, religion, scholars, have, proposed, different, end, dates, for, the, viking, age, but, many, argue, it, ended, in, the, 11th, century, the, year, 1000, is, sometimes, used, as, that, was, the, year, in, which, iceland, converted, to, christianity, marking, the, conversion, of, all, of, scandinavia, to, christianity, the, death, of, harthacnut, the, danish, king, of, england, in, 1042, has, also, been, used, as, an, end, date, history, does, not, often, allow, such, clear, cut, separation, between, arbitrary, ages, and, it, is, not, easy, to, pin, down, a, single, date, that, applies, to, all, the, viking, world, the, viking, age, was, not, a, monolithic, chronological, period, across, three, or, four, hundred, years, but, was, characterised, by, various, distinct, phases, of, viking, activity, it, is, unlikely, that, the, viking, age, could, be, so, neatly, assigned, a, terminal, event, the, end, of, the, viking, era, in, norway, is, marked, by, the, battle, of, stiklestad, in, 1030, in, which, l, fr, haraldsson, later, known, as, olav, the, holy, a, fervent, christianiser, who, dealt, harshly, with, those, suspected, of, clinging, to, pagan, cult, was, killed, although, l, fr, s, army, lost, the, battle, christianity, continued, to, spread, and, after, his, death, he, became, one, of, the, subjects, of, the, three, miracle, stories, given, in, the, manx, chronicle, in, sweden, the, reign, of, king, olof, sk, tkonung, c, 995, 1020, is, considered, to, be, the, transition, from, the, viking, age, to, the, middle, ages, because, he, was, the, first, christian, king, of, the, swedes, and, he, is, associated, with, a, growing, influence, of, the, church, in, what, is, today, southwestern, and, central, sweden, norse, beliefs, persisted, until, the, 12th, century, olof, was, the, last, king, in, scandinavia, to, adopt, christianity, the, end, of, the, viking, age, is, traditionally, marked, in, england, by, the, failed, invasion, attempted, by, the, norwegian, king, harald, iii, haraldr, har, r, i, who, was, defeated, by, saxon, king, harold, godwinson, in, 1066, at, the, battle, of, stamford, bridge, in, ireland, the, capture, of, dublin, by, strongbow, and, his, hiberno, norman, forces, in, 1171, and, 1263, in, scotland, by, the, defeat, of, king, h, kon, h, konarson, at, the, battle, of, largs, by, troops, loyal, to, alexander, iii, godwinson, was, subsequently, defeated, within, a, month, by, another, viking, descendant, william, duke, of, normandy, scotland, took, its, present, form, when, it, regained, territory, from, the, norse, between, the, 13th, and, the, 15th, centuries, the, western, isles, and, the, isle, of, man, remained, under, scandinavian, authority, until, 1266, orkney, and, shetland, belonged, to, the, king, of, norway, as, late, as, 1469, consequently, a, long, viking, age, may, stretch, into, the, 15th, century, according, to, the, anglo, saxon, chronicles, viking, raiders, struck, england, in, 793, and, raided, lindisfarne, the, monastery, that, held, saint, cuthbert, s, relics, killing, the, monks, and, capturing, the, valuables, the, raid, marked, the, beginning, of, the, viking, age, of, invasion, great, but, sporadic, violence, continued, on, england, s, northern, and, eastern, shores, with, raids, continuing, on, a, small, scale, across, coastal, england, while, the, initial, raiding, groups, were, small, a, great, amount, of, planning, is, believed, to, have, been, involved, the, vikings, raided, during, the, winter, of, 840, 841, rather, than, the, usual, summer, having, waited, on, an, island, off, ireland, in, 850, the, vikings, overwintered, for, the, first, time, in, england, on, the, island, of, thanet, kent, in, 854, a, raiding, party, overwintered, a, second, time, at, the, isle, of, sheppey, in, the, thames, estuary, in, 864, they, reverted, to, thanet, for, their, winter, encampment, the, following, year, the, great, heathen, army, led, by, brothers, ivar, the, boneless, halfdan, and, ubba, and, also, by, another, viking, guthrum, arrived, in, east, anglia, they, proceeded, to, cross, england, into, northumbria, and, captured, york, establishing, a, viking, community, in, jorvik, where, some, settled, as, farmers, and, craftsmen, most, of, the, english, kingdoms, being, in, turmoil, could, not, stand, against, the, vikings, in, 867, northumbria, became, the, northern, kingdom, of, the, coalescing, danelaw, after, its, conquest, by, the, ragnarsson, brothers, who, installed, an, englishman, ecgberht, as, a, puppet, king, by, 870, the, great, summer, army, arrived, in, england, led, by, a, viking, leader, called, bagsecg, and, his, five, earls, aided, by, the, great, heathen, army, which, had, already, overrun, much, of, england, from, its, base, in, jorvik, bagsecg, s, forces, and, halfdan, s, forces, through, an, alliance, the, combined, viking, forces, raided, much, of, england, until, 871, when, they, planned, an, invasion, of, wessex, on, 8, january, 871, bagsecg, was, killed, at, the, battle, of, ashdown, along, with, his, earls, as, a, result, many, of, the, vikings, returned, to, northern, england, where, jorvic, had, become, the, centre, of, the, viking, kingdom, but, alfred, of, wessex, managed, to, keep, them, out, of, his, country, alfred, and, his, successors, continued, to, drive, back, the, viking, frontier, and, take, york, a, new, wave, of, vikings, appeared, in, england, in, 947, when, eric, bloodaxe, captured, york, in, 1003, the, danish, king, sweyn, forkbeard, started, a, series, of, raids, against, england, to, avenge, the, st, brice, s, day, massacre, of, england, s, danish, inhabitants, culminating, in, a, full, scale, invasion, that, led, to, sweyn, being, crowned, king, of, england, in, 1013, sweyn, was, also, king, of, denmark, and, parts, of, norway, at, this, time, the, throne, of, england, passed, to, edmund, ironside, of, wessex, after, sweyn, s, death, in, 1014, sweyn, s, son, cnut, the, great, won, the, throne, of, england, in, 1016, through, conquest, when, cnut, the, great, died, in, 1035, he, was, a, king, of, denmark, england, norway, and, parts, of, sweden, harold, harefoot, became, king, of,

the, death, in, the, battle, of, king, harald, hardrada, of, norway, ended, any, hope, of, reviving, cnut, s, north, sea, empire, and, it, is, because, of, this, rather, than, the, norman, conquest, that, 1066, is, often, taken, as, the, end, of, the, viking, age, nineteen, days, later, a, large, army, containing, and, led, by, senior, normans, themselves, mostly, male, line, descendants, of,

in, cogad, g, edel, re, gallaib, the, war, of, the, irish, with, the, foreigners, while, few, records, are, known, the, vikings, are, thought, to, have, led, their, first, raids, in, scotland, on, the, holy, island, of, iona, in, 794, the, year, following, the, raid, on, the, other, holy, island, of, lindisfarne, northumbria, in, 839, a, large, norse, fleet, invaded, via, the, river, tay, and,

of, both, picts, and, scots, can, be, attributed, to, the, aftermath, of, this, event, in, 870, the, britons, of, the, old, north, around, the, firth, of, clyde, came, under, viking, attack, as, well, the, fortress, atop, alt, clut, rock, of, the, clyde, the, brythonic, name, for, dumbarton, rock, which, had, become, the, metonym, for, their, kingdom, was, besieged, by, the, viking, kings, amla, b,

circumstances, the, fall, of, alt, clut, marked, a, watershed, in, the, history, of, the, realm, afterwards, the, capital, of, the, restructured, kingdom, was, relocated, about, 12, miles, 20, km, up, the, river, clyde, to, the, vicinity, of, govan, and, partick, within, present, day, glasgow, and, became, known, as, the, kingdom, of, strathclyde, which, persisted, as, a, major, regional, political, player, for, another, 150, years, the, land, that, now, comprises, most, of, the, scottish, lowlands, had, previously, been, the, northernmost, part, of, the, anglo, saxon, kingdom, of, northumbria, which, fell, apart, with, its, viking, conquest, these, lands, were, never, regained, by, the, anglo, saxons, or, england, the, upheaval, and, pressure, of, viking, raiding, occupation, conquest, and, settlement, resulted, in, alliances, among, the, formerly, enemy, peoples, that, comprised, what, would, become, present, day, scotland, over, the, subsequent, 300, years, this, viking, upheaval, and, pressure, led, to, the, unification, of, the, previously, contending, gaelic, pictish, british, and, english, kingdoms, first, into, the, kingdom, of, alba, and, finally, into, the, greater, kingdom, of, scotland, the, viking, age, in, scotland, came, to, an, end, after, another, 100, years, the, last, vestiges, of, norse, power, in, the, scottish, seas, and, islands, were,

however, claimed, supremacy, in, 875, king, harald, fairhair, led, a, fleet, from, norway, to, scotland, in, his, attempt, to, unite, norway, he, found, that, many, of, those, opposed, to, his, rise, to, power, had, taken, refuge, in, the, isles, from, here, they, were, raiding, not, only, foreign, lands, but, were, also, attacking, norway, itself, after, organising, a, fleet, harald, was, able, to, subdue, the, rebels, and, in, doing, so, brought, the, independent, jarls, under, his, control, many, of, the, rebels, having, fled, to, iceland, he, found, himself, ruling, not, only, norway, but, also, the, isles, man, and, parts, of, scotland, in, 876, the, norse, gaels, of, mann, and, the, hebrides, rebelled, against, harald, a, fleet, was, sent, against, them, led, by, ketil, flatnose,

scotland, and, were, able, to, exact, tribute, from, nearly, half, the, kingdom, until, their, deaths, in, battle, ketil, declared, himself, king, of, the, isles, ketil, was, eventually, outlawed, and, fearing, the, bounty, on, his, head, fled, to, iceland, the, norse, gaelic, kings, of, the, isles, continued, to, act, semi, independently, in, 973, forming, a, defensive, pact, with, the, kings, of, scotland, and, strathclyde, in, 1095, the, king, of, mann, and, the, isles, godred, crovan, was, killed, by, magnus, barelegs, king, of, norway, magnus, and, king, edgar, of, scotland, agreed, on, a, treaty, the, islands, would, be, controlled, by, norway, but, mainland, territories, would, go, to, scotland, the, king, of, norway, nominally, continued, to, be, king, of, the, isles, and, man, however, in, 1156, the, kingdom, was, split, into, two, the, western, isles, and, man, continued, as, to, be, called, the, kingdom, of, man, and, the, isles, but, the, inner, hebrides, came, under, the, influence, of, somerled, a, gaelic, speaker, who, was, styled, king, of, the, hebrides, his, kingdom, was, to, develop, latterly, into, the, lordship, of, the, isles, in, eastern, aberdeenshire, the, danes, invaded, at, least, as, far, north, as, the, area, near, cruden, bay, the, jarls, of, orkney, continued, to, rule, much, of, northern, scotland, until, 1196, when, harald, maddadsson, agreed, to, pay, tribute, to, william, the, lion, king, of, scots, for, his, territories, on, the, mainland, the, end, of, the, viking, age, proper, in, scotland, is, generally, considered, to, be, in, 1266, in, 1263, king, haakon, iv, of, norway, in, retaliation, for, a, scots, expedition, to, skye, arrived, on, the, west, coast, with, a, fleet, from, norway, and, orkney, his, fleet, linked, up, with, those, of, king, magnus, of, man, and, king, dougal, of, the, hebrides, after, peace, talks, failed, his, forces, met, with, the, scots, at, largs, in, ayrshire, the, battle, proved, indecisive, but, it, did, ensure, that, the, norse, were, not, able, to, mount, a, further, attack, that, year, haakon, died, overwintering, in, orkney, and, by, 1266, his, son, magnus, the, law, mender, ceded, the, kingdom, of, man, and, the, isles, with, all, territories, on, mainland, scotland, to, alexander, iii, through, the, treaty, of, perth, orkney, and, shetland, continued, to, be, ruled, as, autonomous, jarldoms, under, norway, until, 1468, when, king, christian, i, pledged, them, as, security, on, the, dowry, of, his, daughter, who, was, betrothed, to, james, iii, of, scotland, although, attempts, were, made, during, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, to, redeem, shetland, without, success, and, charles, ii, ratifying, the, pawning, in, the, act, for, annexation, of,

united, kingdom, incursions, in, wales, were, decisively, reversed, at, the, battle, of, buttington, in, powys, in, 893, when, a, combined, welsh, and, mercian, army, under, thelred, lord, of, the, mercians, defeated, a, danish, band, wales, was, not, colonised, by, the, vikings, as, heavily, as, eastern, england, the, vikings, did, however, settle, in, the, south, around, st, david, s, haverfordwest, and, gower, among, other, places, place, names, such, as, skokholm, skomer, and, swansea, remain, as, evidence, of, the, norse, settlement, the, vikings, however, did, not, subdue, the, welsh, mountain, kingdoms, according, to, the, icelandic, sagas, iceland, was, discovered, by, naddodd, a, viking, from, the, faroe, islands, after, which, it, was, settled, by, mostly, norwegians, fleeing, the, oppressive, rule, of, harald, fairhair, in, 985, ce, while, harsh, the, land, allowed, for, a, pastoral, farming, life, familiar, to, the, norse, according, to, the, saga, of, erik, the,

for, an, area, in, scandinavia, and, fennoscandia, a, contemporary, reference, to, kvenland, is, provided, in, an, old, english, account, written, in, the, 9th, century, it, used, the, information, provided, by, the, norwegian, adventurer, and, traveller, named, ohthere, kvenland, in, that, or, close, to, that, spelling, is, also, known, from, nordic, sources, primarily, icelandic, but, also, one, that, was, possibly, written, in, the, modern, day, area, of, norway, all, the, remaining, nordic, sources, discussing, kvenland, using, that, or, close, to, that, spelling, date, to, the, 12th, and, 13th, centuries, but, some, of, them, in, part, at, least, are, believed, to, be, rewrites, of, older, texts, other, references, and, possible, references, to, kvenland, by, other, names, and, or, spellings, are, discussed, in, the, main, article, of, kvenland, during, the, viking, age, estonia, was, a, finnic, area, divided, between, two, major, cultural, regions, a, coastal, and, an,

regions, the, viking, age, in, estonia, is, considered, to, be, part, of, the, iron, age, period, which, started, around, 400, ce, and, ended, c, 1200, ce, soon, after, estonian, raiders, were, recorded, in, the, eric, chronicle, to, have, sacked, sigtuna, in, 1187, the, society, economy, settlement, and, culture, of, the, territory, of, what, is, in, the, present, day, the, country, of,

of, the, viking, age, the, overall, understanding, of, the, viking, age, in, estonia, is, deemed, to, be, fragmentary, and, superficial, because, of, the, limited, amount, of, surviving, source, material, the, main, sources, for, understanding, the, period, are, remains, of, the, farms, and, fortresses, of, the, era, cemeteries, and, a, large, amount, of, excavated, objects, the, landscape, of, ancient, estonia, featured, numerous, hillforts, some, later, hillforts, on, saaremaa, heavily, fortified, during, the, viking, age, and, on, to, the, 12th, century, there, were, a, number, of, late, prehistoric, or, medieval, harbour, sites, on, the, coast, of, saaremaa, but, none, have, been, found, that, are, large, enough, to, be, international, trade, centres, the, estonian, islands, also, have, a, number, of, graves, from, the, viking, age, both, individual, and, collective, with, weapons, and, jewellery, weapons, found, in, estonian, viking, age, graves, are, common, to, types,

9th, and, 10th, centuries, engaging, in, trade, piracy, and, mercenary, activities, they, roamed, the, river, systems, and, portages, of, gardariki, reaching, the, caspian, sea, and, constantinople, contemporary, english, publications, also, use, the, name, viking, for, early, varangians, in, some, contexts, the, term, varangian, remained, in, usage, in, the, byzantine, empire, until, the, 13th, century, largely, disconnected, from, its, scandinavian, roots, by, then, having, settled, aldeigja, ladoga, in, the, 750s, scandinavian, colonists, were, probably, an, element, in, the, early, ethnogenesis, of, the, rus, people, and, likely, played, a, role, in, the, formation, of, the, rus, khaganate, the, varangians, are, first, mentioned, by, the, primary, chronicle, as, having, exacted, tribute, from, the, slavic, and, finnic, tribes, in, 859, ce, it, was, the, time, of, rapid, expansion, of, the, vikings, in, northern, europe, england, began, to, pay, danegeld, in, 859, ce, and, the, curonians, of, grobin, faced, an, invasion, by, the, swedes, at, about, the, same, date, the, text, of, the, primary, chronicle, says, that, in, 860, 862, the, finnic, and, slavic, tribes, rebelled, against, the, varangian, rus, driving, them, back, to, scandinavia, but, soon, started, to, conflict, with, each, other, the, disorder, prompted, the, tribes, to, invite, back, the, varangian, rus, to, come, and, rule, and, reign, over, us, and, bring, peace, to, the, region, this, was, a, somewhat, bilateral, relation, with, the, varangians, defending, the, cities, that, they, ruled, led, by, rurik, and, his, brothers, truvor, and, sineus, the, varangians, settled, around, the, town, of, novgorod, holmgar, r, in, the, 9th, century, the, rus, operated, the, volga, trade,

the, greeks, rapidly, overtook, it, in, popularity, apart, from, ladoga, and, novgorod, gnezdovo, and, gotland, were, major, centres, for, varangian, trade, the, consensus, among, western, scholars, disputed, by, russian, scholars, who, believe, them, to, be, a, slavic, tribe, is, that, the, rus, people, originated, in, what, is, currently, coastal, eastern, sweden, around, the, 8th, century, and, that, their, name, has, the, same, origin, as, that, of, roslagen, in, sweden, the, maritime, districts, of, east, g, tland, and, uppland, were, known, in, earlier, times, as, ro, er, or, ro, in, and, later, as, roslagen, according, to, thorsten, andersson, the, russian, folk, name, rus, ultimately, derives, from, the, noun, ro, er, rowing, a, word, also, used, in, naval, campaigns, in, the, le, unger, old, norse, lei, angr, system, of, organizing, a, coastal, fleet, the, old, swedish, place, name, ro, rin, in, the, older, iteration, ro, er, contains, the, word, ro, er, and, is, still, used, in, the, form, of, roden, as, a, historical, name, for, the, coastal, areas, of, svealand, in, modern, times, the, name, still, exists, as, roslagen, the, name, of, the, coastal, area, of, uppland, province, according, to, stefan, brink, the, name, rus, derives, from, the, words, ro, row, and, rodd, a, rowing, session, the, term, varangian, became, more, common, from, the, 11th, century, onwards, in, these, years, swedish, men, left, to, enlist, in, the, byzantine, varangian, guard, in, such, numbers, that, a, medieval, swedish, law, v, stg, talagen, used, in, the, province, v, sterg, tland, declared, that, no, one, could, inherit, while, staying, in, greece, the, then, scandinavian, term, for, the, byzantine, empire, to, stop, the, emigration, especially, as, two, other,

normandy, and, the, british, isles, varangian, culture, did, not, survive, to, a, great, extent, in, the, east, instead, the, varangian, ruling, classes, of, the, two, powerful, city, states, of, novgorod, and, kiev, were, thoroughly, slavicised, by, the, beginning, of, the, 11th, century, some, evidence, suggests, that, old, norse, may, have, been, spoken, amongst, the, rus, later, however, old, east, norse, was, probably, still, spoken, in, kievan, rus, at, novgorod, until, the, 13th, century, according, to, the, nationalencyklopedin, swedish, national, encyclopedia, viking, age, scandinavian, settlements, were, set, up, along, the, southern, coast, of, the, baltic, sea, primarily, for, trade, purposes, their, emergence, appears, to, coincide, with, the, settlement, and, consolidation, of, the, coastal, slavic, tribes, in, the, respective, areas, the, archaeological, record, indicates, that, substantial, cultural, exchange, between, scandinavian, and, slavic, traditions, and, technologies, occurred, it, is, known, that, slavic, and, scandinavian, craftsmen, had, different, processes, in, crafts, and, productions, in, the, lagoons, and, delta, of, the, eastern, and, southern, baltic, there, is, evidence, of, slavic, boatbuilding, practices, somewhat, divergent, from, the, viking, tradition, and, of, a, fusion, of, the, two, in, a, shipyard, site, from, the, viking, age, on, the, island, of, falster, in, denmark, slavic, scandinavian, settlements, on, the, mecklenburgian, coast, include, the, maritime, trading, center, reric, gro, str,

for, the, emir, s, forces, but, the, viking, survivors, had, to, negotiate, a, peace, to, leave, the, area, surrendering, their, plunder, and, the, hostages, they, had, taken, to, sell, as, slaves,

muslim, historian, a, mad, al, r, z, who, tells, of, a, viking, fleet, of, sixty, two, ships, that, sailed, up, to, i, b, liya, and, occupied, al, jaz, ra, al, khadr, the, muslims, seized, two, of, their, ships, laden, with, goods, and, coins, off, the, coast, of, shid, nah, sidonia, the, ships, were, destroyed, and, their, viking, crews, killed, the, remaining, vessels, continued, up, the, atlantic, coast, and, landed, near, pampeluna, called, banbal, na, in, arabic, where, they, took, their, emir, ghars, a, ibn, wanaqu, garc, a, i, iquez, prisoner, until, in, 861, he, was, ransomed, for, 70, 000, dinars, according, to, the, annales, bertiniani, danish, vikings, embarked, on, a, long, voyage, in, 859, sailing, eastward, through, the, strait, of, gibraltar, then, up, the, river, rh, ne, where, they, raided, monasteries, and, towns, and, established, a, base, in, the, camargue, afterwards, they, raided, nak, r, in, what, is, now, morocco, kidnapped, women, of, the, royal, family, and, returned, them, when, the, emir, of, c, rdoba, paid, their, ransoms, the, vikings, made, several, incursions, in, the, years, 859, 966, and, 971, with, intentions, more, diplomatic, than, bellicose, although, an, invasion, in, 971, was, repelled, when, the, viking, fleet, was, totally, annihilated, vikings, attacked, talayata, again, in, 889, at, the, instigation, of, kurayb, ibn, khaldun, of, i, b, liya, in, 1015, a, viking, fleet, entered, the, river, minho, and, sacked, the, episcopal, city, of, tui, galicia, no, new, bishop, was, appointed, until, 1070, in, 844, a, fleet, of, several, dozen, viking, longships, with, square, brown, sails, appeared, in, the, mar, da, palha, sea, of, straw, i, e, the, mouth, of, the, river, tagus, at, the, time, the, city, later, called, lisbon, was, under, muslim, rule, and, known, in, arabic, as, al, us, h, b, na, or, al, i, b, nah, after, a, thirteen, day, siege, in, which, they, plundered, the, surrounding, countryside, the, vikings, conquered, al, us, h, b, na, but, eventually, retreated, in, the, face, of, continued, resistance, by, the, townspeople, led, by, their, governor, wahb, allah, ibn, hazm, the, chronicler, ibn, hayy, n, who, wrote, the, most, reliable, early, history, of, al, andalus, in, his, kit, b, almuqtabis, quoted, the, muslim, historian, ahmad, ibn, muhammad, al, r, z, at, the, end, of, the, year, 229, 844, the, ships, of, the, norsemen, who, were, known, in, al, andalus, as, majus, appeared, off, the, western, coast, of, al, andalus, landing, at, lisbon, their, first, point, of, entry, to, the, forbidden, lands, it, was, a, wednesday, the, first, day, of, dhu, al, hijjah, in, that, year, and, they, remained, there, thirteen, days, during, which, time, they, engaged, in, three, battles, with, the, muslims, the, viking, age, settlements, in, greenland, were, established, in, the, sheltered, fjords, of, the, southern, and, western, coast, they, settled, in, three, separate, areas, along, roughly, 650, km, 350, nmi, 400, mi, of, the, western, coast, while, harsh, the, microclimates, along, some, fjords, allowed, for, a, pastoral, lifestyle, similar, to, that, of, iceland, until, the, climate, changed, for, the, worse, with, the, little, ice, age, c, 1400, in, about, 986, the, norwegian, vikings, bjarni, herj, lfsson, leif, ericson, and, rfinnr, karlsefni, from, greenland, reached, mainland, north, america, over, 500, years, before, christopher, columbus, and, they, attempted, to, settle, the, land, they, called, vinland, they, created, a, small, settlement, on, the, northern, peninsula, of, present, day, newfoundland, near, l, anse, aux, meadows, conflict, with, indigenous, peoples, and, lack, of, support, from, greenland, brought, the, vinland, colony, to, an, end, within, a, few, years, the, archaeological, remains, are, now, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, the, vikings, were, among, the, most, advanced, of, all, societies, of, the, time, in, their, naval, technology, and, were, noted, in, other, technological, works, as, well, the, vikings, were, equipped, with, the, technologically, superior, longships, for, purposes, of, conducting, trade, however, another, type, of, ship, the, knarr, wider, and, deeper, in, draft, were, customarily, used, the, vikings, were, competent, sailors, adept, in, land, warfare, as, well, as, at, sea, and, they, often, struck, at, accessible, and, poorly, defended, targets, usually, with, near, impunity, the, effectiveness, of, these, tactics, earned, vikings, a, formidable, reputation, as, raiders, and, pirates, the, vikings, used, their, longships, to, travel, vast, distances, and, attain, certain, tactical, advantages, in, battle, they, could, perform, highly, efficient, hit, and, run, attacks, in, which, they, quickly, approached, a, target, then, left, as, rapidly, as, possible, before, a, counter, offensive, could, be, launched, because, of, the, ships, negligible, draft, the, vikings, could, sail, in, shallow, waters, allowing, them, to, invade, far, inland, along, rivers, the, ships, were, agile, and, light, enough, to, be, carried, over, land, from, one, river, system, to, another, under, sail, the, same, boats, could, tackle, open, water, and, cross, the, unexplored, wastes, of, the, north, atlantic, the, ships, speed, was, also, prodigious, for, the, time, estimated, at, a, maximum, of, 14, 15, knots, 26, 28, km, h, the, use, of, the, longships, ended, when, technology, changed, and, ships, began, to, be, constructed, using, saws, instead, of, axes, resulting, in, inferior, vessels, while, battles, at, sea, were, rare, they, would, occasionally, occur, when, viking, ships, attempted, to, board, european, merchant, vessels, in, scandinavian, waters, when, larger, scale, battles, ensued, viking, crews, would, rope, together, all, nearby, ships, and, slowly, proceed, towards, the, enemy, targets, while, advancing, the, warriors, hurled, spears, arrows, and, other, projectiles, at, the, opponents, when, the, ships, were, sufficiently, close, melee, combat, would, ensue, using, axes, swords, and, spears, until, the, enemy, ship, could, be, easily, boarded, the, roping, technique, allowed, viking, crews, to, remain, strong, in, numbers, and, act, as, a, unit, but, this, uniformity, also, created, problems, a, viking, ship, in, the, line, could, not, retreat, or, pursue, hostiles, without, breaking, the, formation, and, cutting, the, ropes, which, weakened, the, overall, viking, fleet, and, was, a, burdensome, task, to, perform, in, the, heat, of, battle, in, general, these, tactics, enabled, vikings, to, quickly, destroy, the, meagre, opposition, posted, during, raids, together, with, an, increasing, centralisation, of, government, in, the, scandinavian, countries, the, old, system, of, leidang, a, fleet, mobilisation, system, where, every, skipreide, ship, community, had, to, maintain, one, ship, and, a, crew, was, discontinued, as, a, purely, military, institution, as, the, duty, to, build, and, man, a, ship, soon, was, converted, into, a, tax, the, norwegian, leidang, was, called, under, haakon, haakonson, for, his, 1263, expedition, to, scotland, during, the, scottish, norwegian, war, and, the, last, recorded, calling, of, it, was, in, 1603, however, already, by, the, 11th, and, 12th, centuries, perhaps, in, response, to, the, longships, european, fighting, ships, were, built, with, raised, platforms, fore, and, aft, from, which, archers, could, shoot, down, into, the, relatively, low, longships, this, led, to, the, defeat, of, longship, navies, in, most, subsequent, naval, engagements, e, g, with, the, hanseatic, league, the, vikings, were, also, said, to, have, fine, weapons, generally, vikings, used, axes, as, weapons, due, to, the, lessened, amount, of, iron, required, for, their, creations, swords, were, typically, seen, as, a, mark, of, wealth, spears, were, also, a, common, weapon, among, vikings, great, amounts, of, time, and, artistry, were, expended, in, the, creation, of, viking, weapons, ornamentation, is, commonly, seen, among, viking, weapons, scandinavian, architecture, during, the, viking, age, most, often, involved, wood, due, to, the, abundance, of, the, material, longhouses, a, form, of, home, often, featuring, ornamentation, are, commonly, seen, as, the, defining, building, of, the, viking, age, exactly, how, the, vikings, navigated, the, open, seas, with, such, success, is, unclear, while, some, evidence, points, to, the, use, of, calcite, sunstones, to, find, the, sun, s, location, modern, reproductions, of, viking, sky, polarimetric, navigation, have, found, these, sun, compasses, to, be, highly, inaccurate, and, not, usable, in, cloudy, or, foggy, weather, the, archaeological, find, known, as, the, visby, lenses, from, the, swedish, island, of, gotland, may, be, components, of, a, telescope, it, appears, to, date, from, long, before, the, invention, of, the, telescope, in, the, 17th, century, recent, evidence, suggests, that, the, vikings, also, made, use, of, an, optical, compass, as, a, navigation, aid, using, the, light, splitting, and, polarisation, filtering, properties, of, iceland, spar, to, find, the, location, of, the, sun, when, it, was, not, directly, visible, for, most, of, the, viking, age, scandinavian, society, generally, followed, norse, paganism, the, traditions, of, this, faith, including, valhalla, and, the, sir, are, sometimes, cited, as, a, factor, in, the, creation, of, viking, warrior, culture, however, scandinavia, was, eventually, christianised, towards, the, later, viking, age, with, early, centres, of, christianity, especially, in, denmark, some, of, the, most, important, trading, ports, founded, by, the, norse, during, the, period, include, both, existing, and, former, cities, such, as, aarhus, denmark, ribe, denmark, hedeby, germany, vineta, pomerania, truso, poland, bj, rgvin, norway, kaupang, norway, skiringssal, norway, birka, sweden, bordeaux, france, york, england, dublin, ireland, and, aldeigjuborg, russia, as, viking, ships, carried, cargo, and, trade, goods, throughout, the, baltic, area, and, beyond, their, active, trading, centres, grew, into, thriving, towns, one, important, centre, of, trade, was, at, hedeby, close, to, the, border, with, the, franks, it, was, effectively, a, crossroads, between, the, cultures, until, its, eventual, destruction, by, the, norwegians, in, an, internecine, dispute, around, 1050, york, was, the, centre, of, the, kingdom, of, j, rv, k, from, 866, and, discoveries, there, e, g, a, silk, cap, a, counterfeit, of, a, coin, from, samarkand, and, a, cowry, shell, from, the, red, sea, or, the, persian, gulf, suggest, that, scandinavian, trade, connections, in, the, 10th, century, reached, beyond, byzantium, however, those, items, could, also, have, been, byzantine, imports, and, there, is, no, reason, to, assume, that, the, varangians, travelled, significantly, beyond, byzantium, and, the, caspian, sea, viking, trade, routes, extended, far, beyond, scandinavia, as, scandinavian, ships, penetrated, southward, on, the, rivers, of, eastern, europe, to, acquire, financial, capital, they, encountered, the, nomad, peoples, of, the, steppes, leading, to, the, beginning, of, a, trading, system, that, connected, russia, and, scandinavia, with, the, northern, routes, of, the, eurasian, silk, road, network, during, the, middle, ages, the, volga, trade, route, connected, northern, europe, and, northwestern, russia, with, the, caspian, sea, via, the, volga, river, the, international, trade, routes, that, enabled, the, passage, of, goods, by, ship, from, scandinavia, to, the, east, were, mentioned, in, early, medieval, literature, as, the, austrrvegr, passing, through, the, eastern, baltic, region, ships, headed, to, the, river, volga, sailed, through, the, gulf, of, finland, while, those, destined, for, byzantium, might, take, one, of, several, routes, through, present, day, north, eastern, poland, or, the, baltic, lands, the, vikings, catered, to, the, demand, for, slaves, in, the, southern, slave, markets, in, the, orthodox, eastern, roman, empire, and, the, muslim, umayyad, caliphate, both, of, whom, desired, slaves, of, a, religion, different, from, their, own, the, trade, route, from, the, varangians, to, the, greeks, connected, scandinavia, kievan, rus, and, the, eastern, roman, empire, the, rus, were, of, note, as, merchants, who, supplied, honey, wax, and, slaves, to, constantinople, the, varangians, served, as, mercenaries, of, russian, princes, then, of, the, swedish, princes, who, founded, and, ruled, norse, kingdoms, in, eastern, europe, such, as, at, kiev, and, novgorod, the, viking, age, saw, many, of, the, earliest, scandinavian, cultural, developments, the, traditional, icelandic, sagas, still, often, read, today, are, seen, as, characteristic, literary, works, of, northern, europe, old, english, works, such, as, beowulf, written, in, the, tradition, of, germanic, heroic, legend, show, viking, influences, in, beowulf, this, influence, is, seen, in, the, language, and, setting, of, the, poem, another, example, of, viking, age, cultural, influence, is, the, old, norse, influence, in, the, english, language, this, influence, is, primarily, a, legacy, of, the, various, viking, invasions, of, england, according, to, archaeologist, liv, helga, dommasnes, writing, in, 1998, although, archaeological, sources, pertinent, to, the, study, of, women, s, roles, in, scandinavia, were, most, plentiful, from, the, viking, age, compared, to, other, historical, eras, not, many, archaeologists, took, advantage, of, the, opportunities, they, represented, she, alludes, to, the, fact, that, the, picture, commonly, presented, of, viking, society, during, the, viking, age, was, of, a, society, of, men, engaged, in, their, various, occupations, or, positions, with, scant, mention, of, the, women, and, children, who, were, also, part, of, it, in, her, reckoning, given, this, basic, flaw, in, the, modern, image, of, viking, society, how, knowledge, of, the, past, is, organised, must, be, considered, accordingly, language, is, an, essential, part, of, this, organisation, of, knowledge, and, the, concepts, of, modern, languages, are, tools, for, understanding, the, realities, of, the, past, and, for, organising, that, knowledge, even, though, they, are, artefacts, of, our, own, time, and, perceived, reality, written, sources, although, scarce, appear, to, have, been, prioritised, even, though, it, is, understood, that, these, written, sources, are, biased, almost, all, of, them, originate, from, other, cultures, as, literature, from, viking, societies, is, sparse, since, it, unambiguously, transmits, meaning, in, literary, terms, it, is, fairly, clear, that, this, meaning, is, not, derived, from, the, ideology, of, viking, age, people, but, rather, from, that, of, early, northern, christianity, medieval, studies, scholar, gro, steinsland, argues, that, the, transformation, from, heathen, to, christian, religion, in, viking, society, was, a, radical, break, rather, than, a, gradual, transition, and, dommasnes, says, this, should, have, bearing, on, consideration, of, the, transformation, of, late, viking, age, traditions, before, they, were, recorded, in, 12th, or, 13th, century, literature, by, this, reasoning, changing, cultural, values, necessarily, greatly, affected, perceptions, of, women, particularly, and, of, gender, roles, generally, judith, jesch, professor, of, viking, age, studies, at, the, university, of, nottingham, suggests, in, her, women, in, the, viking, age, that, if, historians, emphasis, on, vikings, as, warriors, made, invisible, the, women, in, the, background, then, it, is, not, always, clear, where, the, more, visible, female, counterparts, of, the, new, urban, vikings, have, come, from, she, says, it, is, impossible, to, study, the, vikings, without, a, conception, of, the, entire, historical, period, they, lived, in, of, the, culture, that, produced, them, and, of, other, cultures, they, influenced, by, her, lights, not, accounting, for, the, doings, of, half, the, population, would, be, ludicrous, published, in, 1991, women, in, the, viking, age, develops, jesch, s, thesis, that, the, texts, of, the, icelandic, sagas, slendingas, gur, are, recordings, of, mythological, narratives, preserved, in, the, forms, in, which, they, were, written, by, 13th, century, antiquaries, in, iceland, they, cannot, be, interpreted, literally, as, the, authentic, voice, of, vikings, embodying, as, they, do, the, preconceptions, of, those, medieval, icelanders, these, sagas, formerly, believed, to, have, been, based, on, actual, historical, traditions, are, now, commonly, regarded, as, imaginative, creations, with, their, origins, in, oral, traditions, there, is, little, confidence, in, them, as, historical, truth, but, they, express, what, they, tell, more, directly, than, the, dry, bones, of, archaeology, or, the, brief, messages, on, runestones, the, modern, view, of, the, viking, age, is, completely, entwined, with, knowledge, imparted, by, the, sagas, and, they, are, the, main, source, of, a, broadly, held, belief, that, women, in, the, viking, age, were, independent, assertive, and, had, agency, jesch, describes, the, content, of, runic, inscriptions, as, connecting, people, who, live, in, modern, times, with, women, of, the, viking, age, similarly, to, archaeological, evidence, often, telling, more, about, the, lives, of, women, than, the, material, remains, revealed, in, archaeological, excavations, she, considers, these, inscriptions, as, contemporary, evidence, originating, within, the, culture, instead, of, from, the, incomplete, or, prejudiced, viewpoint, of, the, cultural, outsider, and, sees, most, of, them, as, narratives, in, a, narrow, sense, that, supply, details, illuminating, the, overall, picture, derived, from, archaeological, sources, they, allow, actual, persons, to, be, identified, and, reveal, information, about, them, such, as, their, family, relationships, their, names, and, perhaps, facts, concerning, their, individual, lives, birgit, sawyer, says, her, book, the, viking, age, rune, stones, aims, to, show, that, the, corpus, of, runestones, considered, as, a, whole, is, a, fruitful, source, of, knowledge, about, the, religious, political, social, and, economic, history, of, scandinavia, in, the, 10th, and, 11th, centuries, using, data, from, her, database, she, finds, that, runestones, cast, light, on, settlement, patterns, communications, kinship, and, naming, customs, and, the, evolution, of, language, and, poetry, systematically, researching, the, material, leads, to, her, hypothesis, that, runic, inscriptions, mirrored, inheritance, customs, entailing, not, only, lands, or, goods, but, also, rights, obligations, and, rank, in, society, although, women, in, viking, society, like, men, had, tombstones, over, their, graves, runestones, were, raised, primarily, to, memorialise, men, with, the, lives, of, few, women, being, commemorated, by, runestones, sawyer, says, only, 7, per, cent, and, half, of, those, were, with, men, because, there, was, a, much, larger, per, centage, of, women, s, graves, with, rich, appointments, in, the, iron, age, the, comparatively, smaller, number, of, runestones, memorialising, women, indicates, that, the, trend, reflects, changes, in, burial, customs, and, religion, only, in, part, most, of, those, honoured, with, runestones, were, men, and, the, emphasis, was, on, those, who, sponsored, the, monuments, typical, medieval, grave, monuments, name, only, the, deceased, but, viking, age, runestones, prioritise, the, sponsors, first, and, foremost, therefore, they, are, monuments, to, the, living, as, much, as, to, the, dead, the, 12th, century, icelandic, gray, goose, laws, icelandic, gr, g, s, state, that, swedes, norwegians, icelanders, and,

are, mostly, short, a, good, deal, of, the, vocabulary, morphology, and, phonology, of, the, runic, inscriptions, little, is, known, definitely, about, their, syntax, can, be, shown, to, develop, regularly, into, viking, age, medieval, and, modern, scandinavian, reflexes, says, michael, barnes, according, to, david, arter, old, norse, was, for, a, while, during, the, viking, age, a, lingua, franca, spoken, not, just, in, scandinavia, but, also, in, the, courts, of, the, scandinavian, rulers, in, ireland, scotland, england, france, and, russia, the, norse, origin, of, some, words, used, today, is, obvious, as, in, the, word, haar, referring, to, the, cold, sea, mist, on, the, east, coast, of, scotland, and, england, it, derives, from, the, old, norse, ha, rr, the, long, term, linguistic, effects, of, the, viking, settlements, in, england, were, threefold, over, a, thousand, old, norse, words, eventually, became, part, of, standard, english, numerous, places, in, the, east, and, north, east, of, england, have, danish, names, and, many, english, personal, names, are, of, scandinavian, origin, scandinavian, words, that, entered, the, english, language, included, landing, score, beck, fellow, take, busting, and, steersman, the, vast, majority, of, loan, words, did, not, appear, in, documents, until, the, early, 12th, century, these, included, many, modern, words, which, used, sk, sounds, such, as, skirt, sky, and, skin, other, words, appearing, in, written, sources, at, this, time, included, again, awkward, birth, cake, dregs, fog, freckles, gasp, law, moss, neck, ransack, root, scowl, sister, seat, sly, smile, want, weak, and, window, from, old, norse, meaning, wind, eye, some, of, the, words, that, came, into, use, are, among, the, most, common, in,

an, analysis, of, names, ending, in, son, the, distribution, of, family, names, showing, scandinavian, influence, is, still, concentrated, in, the, north, and, east, corresponding, to, areas, of, former, viking, settlement, early, medieval, records, indicate, that, over, 60, of, personal, names, in, yorkshire, and, north, lincolnshire, showed, scandinavian, influence, a, genetic, study, published, at, biorxiv, in, july, 2019, and, in, nature, in, september, 2020, examined, the, population, genomics, of, the, viking, age, the, remains, of, four, hundred, forty, two, ancient, humans, from, across, europe, and, the, north, atlantic, were, surveyed, stretching, from, the, bronze, age, to, the, early, modern, period, in, terms, of, y, dna, composition, viking, individuals, were, similar, to, present, day, scandinavians, the, most, common, y, dna, haplogroup, in, the, study, was, i1, 95, samples, r1b, 84, samples, and, r1a, especially, but, not, exclusively, of, the, scandinavian, r1a, z284, subclade, 61, samples, it, was, found, that, there, was, a, notable, foreign, gene, flow, into, scandinavia, in, the, years, preceding, the, viking, age, and, during, the, viking, age, itself, this, gene, flow, entered, denmark, and, eastern, sweden, from, which, it, spread, into, the, rest, of, scandinavia, the, y, dna, of, viking, age, samples, suggests, that, this, may, partly, have, been, descendants, of, the, germanic, tribes, from, the, migration, period, returning, to, scandinavia, the, study, also, found, that, despite, close, cultural, similarities, there, were, distinct, genetic, differences, between, regional, populations, in, the, viking, age, these, differences, have, persisted, into, modern, times, inland, areas, were, found, to, be, more, genetically, homogenous, than, coastal, areas, and, islands, such, as, land, and, gotland, these, islands, were, probably, important, trade, settlements, consistent, with, historical, records, the, study, found, evidence, of, a, major, influx, of, danish, viking, ancestry, into, england, a, swedish, influx, into, estonia, and, finland, and, norwegian, influx, into, ireland, iceland, and, greenland, during, the, viking, age, the, vikings, were, found, to, have, left, a, profound, genetic, imprint, in, the, areas, they, settled, which, has, persisted, into, modern, times, with, e, g, the, contemporary, population, of, the, united, kingdom, having, up, to, 6, viking, dna, the, study, also, showed, that, some, local, people, of, scotland, were, buried, as, vikings, and, may, have, taken, on, viking, identities, margaryan, et, al, 2020, examined, the, skeletal, remains, of, 42, individuals, from, the, salme, ship, burials, in, estonia, the, skeletal, remains, belonged, to, warriors, killed, in, battle, who, were, later, buried, together, with, numerous, valuable, weapons, and, armour, dna, testing, and, isotope, analysis, revealed, that, the, men, came, from, central, sweden, margaryan, et, al, 2020, examined, an, elite, warrior, burial, from, bodzia, poland, dated, to, 1010, 1020, the, cemetery, in, bodzia, is, exceptional, in, terms, of, scandinavian, and, kievian, rus, links, the, bodzia, man, sample, vk157, or, burial, e864, i, was, not, a, simple, warrior, from, the, princely, retinue, but, he, belonged, to, the, princely, family, himself, his, burial, is, the, richest, one, in, the, whole, cemetery, moreover, strontium, analysis, of, his, teeth, enamel, shows, he, was, not, local, it, is, assumed, that, he, came, to, poland, with, the, prince, of, kiev, sviatopolk, the, accursed, and, met, a, violent, death, in, combat, this, corresponds, to, the, events, of, 1018, when, sviatopolk, himself, disappeared, after, having, retreated, from, kiev, to, poland, it, cannot, be, excluded, that, the, bodzia, man, was, sviatopolk, himself, as, the, genealogy, of, the, rurikids, at, this, period, is, extremely, dubious, and, the, dates, of, birth, of, many, princes, of, this, dynasty, may, be, quite, approximative, the, bodzia, man, carried, haplogroup, i1, s2077, and, had, both, scandinavian, ancestry, and, russian, admixture, the, genetic, data, from, these, areas, affirmed, conclusions, previously, drawn, from, historical, and, archaeological, evidence, and, they, came, to, the, church, of, lindisfarne, laid, everything, waste, with, grievous, plundering, trampled, the, holy, places, with, polluted, feet, dug, up, the, altars, and, seized, all, the, treasures, of, the, holy, church, they, killed, some, of, the,
