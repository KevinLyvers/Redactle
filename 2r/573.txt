the, berlin, wall, german, berliner, mauer, pronounced, was, a, guarded, concrete, barrier, that, encircled, west, berlin, from, 1961, to, 1989, separating, it, from, east, berlin, and, the, german, democratic, republic, gdr, east, germany, construction, of, the, berlin, wall, was, commenced, by, the, government, of, the, gdr, on, 13, august, 1961, it, included, guard, towers, placed, along, large, concrete, walls, accompanied, by, a, wide, area, later, known, as, the, death, strip, that, contained, anti, vehicle, trenches, beds, of, nails, and, other, defenses, the, primary, intention, for, the, wall, s, construction, was, to, prevent, east, german, citizens, from, fleeing, to, the, west, the, soviet, bloc, propaganda, portrayed, the, wall, as, protecting, its, population, from, fascist, elements, conspiring, to, prevent, the, will, of, the, people, from, building, a, communist, state, in, the, gdr, the, authorities, officially, referred, to, the, berlin, wall, as, the, anti, fascist, protection, rampart, german, antifaschistischer, schutzwall, pronounced, conversely, west, berlin, s, city, government, sometimes, referred, to, it, as, the, wall, of, shame, a, term, coined, by, mayor, willy, brandt, in, reference, to, the, wall, s, restriction, on, freedom, of, movement, along, with, the, separate, and, much, longer, inner, german, border, which, demarcated, the, border, between, east, and, west, germany, it, came, to, symbolize, physically, the, iron, curtain, that, separated, the, western, bloc, and, soviet, satellite, states, of, the, eastern, bloc, during, the, cold, war, before, the, wall, s, erection, 3, 5, million, east, germans, circumvented, eastern, bloc, emigration, restrictions, and, defected, from, the, gdr, many, by, crossing, over, the, border, from, east, berlin, into, west, berlin, from, there, they, could, then, travel, to, west, germany, and, to, other, western, european, countries, between, 1961, and, 1989, the, deadly, force, associated, with, the, wall, prevented, almost, all, such, emigration, during, this, period, over, 100, 000, people, attempted, to, escape, and, over, 5, 000, people, succeeded, in, escaping, over, the, wall, with, an, estimated, death, toll, of, those, murdered, by, east, german, authorities, ranging, from, 136, to, more, than, 200, in, and, around, berlin, in, 1989, a, series, of, revolutions, in, nearby, eastern, bloc, countries, poland, and, hungary, in, particular, and, the, events, of, the, pan, european, picnic, set, in, motion, a, peaceful, development, during, which, the, iron, curtain, largely, broke, rulers, in, the, east, came, under, public, pressure, to, cease, their, repressive, policies, after, several, weeks, of, civil, unrest, the, east, german, government, announced, on, 9, november, 1989, that, all, gdr, citizens, could, visit, the, frg, and, west, berlin, crowds, of, east, germans, crossed, and, climbed, onto, the, wall, joined, by, west, germans, on, the, other, side, and, souvenir, hunters, chipped, away, parts, of, the, wall, over, the, next, few, weeks, the, brandenburg, gate, a, few, meters, from, the, berlin, wall, reopened, on, 22, december, 1989, with, demolition, of, the, wall, beginning, on, 13, june, 1990, and, concluding, in, 1994, the, fall, of, the, berlin, wall, paved, the, way, for, german, reunification, which, formally, took, place, on, 3, october, 1990, after, the, end, of, world, war, ii, in, europe, what, remained, of, pre, war, germany, west, of, the, oder, neisse, line, was, divided, into, four, occupation, zones, as, per, the, potsdam, agreement, each, one, controlled, by, one, of, the, four, occupying, allied, powers, the, united, states, the, united, kingdom, france, and, the, soviet, union, the, capital, berlin, as, the, seat, of, the, allied, control, council, was, similarly, subdivided, into, four, sectors, despite, the, city, s, location, which, was, fully, within, the, soviet, zone, within, two, years, political, divisions, increased, between, the, soviets, and, the, other, occupying, powers, these, included, the, soviets, refusal, to, agree, to, reconstruction, plans, making, post, war, germany, self, sufficient, and, to, a, detailed, accounting, of, industrial, plants, goods, and, infrastructure, some, of, which, had, already, been, removed, by, the, soviets, france, the, united, kingdom, the, united, states, and, the, benelux, countries, later, met, to, combine, the, non, soviet, zones, of, germany, into, one, zone, for, reconstruction, and, to, approve, the, extension, of, the, marshall, plan, following, the, defeat, of, nazi, germany, in, world, war, ii, the, soviet, union, engineered, the, installation, of, communist, regimes, in, most, of, the, countries, occupied, by, soviet, military, forces, at, the, end, of, the, war, including, poland, hungary, czechoslovakia, bulgaria, romania, and, the, gdr, which, together, with, albania, formed, the, comecon, in, 1949, and, later, a, military, alliance, the, warsaw, pact, the, beginning, of, the, cold, war, saw, the, eastern, bloc, of, the, soviet, union, confront, the, western, bloc, of, the, united, states, with, the, latter, grouping, becoming, largely, united, in, 1949, under, nato, and, the, former, grouping, becoming, largely, united, in, 1955, under, the, warsaw, pact, as, the, soviet, union, already, had, an, armed, presence, and, political, domination, all, over, its, eastern, satellite, states, by, 1955, the, pact, has, been, long, considered, superfluous, and, because, of, the, rushed, way, in, which, it, was, conceived, nato, officials, labeled, it, a, cardboard, castle, there, was, no, direct, military, confrontation, between, the, two, organizations, instead, the, conflict, was, fought, on, an, ideological, basis, and, through, proxy, wars, both, nato, and, the, warsaw, pact, led, to, the, expansion, of, military, forces, and, their, integration, into, the, respective, blocs, the, warsaw, pact, s, largest, military, engagement, was, the, warsaw, pact, invasion, of, czechoslovakia, its, own, member, state, in, august, 1968, since, the, end, of, the, war, the, ussr, installed, a, soviet, style, regime, in, the, soviet, occupation, zone, of, germany, and, later, founded, the, gdr, with, the, country, s, political, system, based, on, a, centrally, planned, socialist, economic, model, with, nationalized, means, of, production, and, with, repressive, secret, police, institutions, under, party, dictatorship, of, the, sed, sozialistische, einheitspartei, deutschlands, socialist, unity, party, of, germany, similar, to, the, party, dictatorship, of, the, soviet, communist, party, in, the, ussr, at, the, same, time, a, parallel, country, was, established, under, the, control, of, the, western, powers, in, the, zones, of, post, war, germany, occupied, by, them, culminating, in, the, foundation, of, the, federal, republic, of, germany, in, 1949, which, initially, claimed, to, be, the, sole, legitimate, power, in, all, of, germany, east, and, west, the, material, standard, of, living, in, the, western, zones, of, berlin, began, to, improve, quickly, and, residents, of, the, soviet, zone, soon, began, leaving, for, the, west, in, large, numbers, fleeing, hunger, poverty, and, repression, in, the, soviet, zone, for, a, better, life, in, the, west, soon, residents, of, other, parts, of, the, soviet, zone, began, to, escape, to, the, west, through, berlin, and, this, migration, called, in, germany, republikflucht, deprived, the, soviet, zone, not, only, of, working, forces, desperately, needed, for, post, war, reconstruction, but, disproportionately, of, highly, educated, people, which, came, to, be, known, as, the, brain, drain, in, 1948, in, response, to, moves, by, the, western, powers, to, establish, a, separate, federal, system, of, government, in, the, western, zones, and, to, extend, the, us, marshall, plan, of, economic, assistance, to, germany, the, soviets, instituted, the, berlin, blockade, preventing, people, food, materials, and, supplies, from, arriving, in, west, berlin, by, land, routes, through, the, soviet, zone, the, united, states, the, united, kingdom, france, canada, australia, new, zealand, and, several, other, countries, began, a, massive, airlift, supplying, west, berlin, with, food, and, other, supplies, the, soviets, mounted, a, public, relations, campaign, against, the, western, policy, change, communists, attempted, to, disrupt, the, elections, of, 1948, preceding, large, losses, therein, while, 300, 000, berliners, demonstrated, for, the, international, airlift, to, continue, in, may, 1949, stalin, lifted, the, blockade, permitting, the, resumption, of, western, shipments, to, berlin, the, german, democratic, republic, the, gdr, east, germany, was, declared, on, 7, october, 1949, on, that, day, the, ussr, ended, the, soviet, military, government, which, had, governed, the, soviet, occupation, zone, sowetische, besatzungszone, since, the, end, of, the, war, and, handed, over, legal, power, to, the, provisorische, volkskammer, under, the, new, constitution, of, the, gdr, which, came, into, force, that, day, however, until, 1955, the, soviets, maintained, considerable, legal, control, over, the, gdr, state, including, the, regional, governments, through, the, sowetische, kontrollkommission, and, maintained, a, presence, in, various, east, german, administrative, military, and, secret, police, structures, even, after, legal, sovereignty, of, the, gdr, was, restored, in, 1955, the, soviet, union, continued, to, maintain, considerable, influence, over, administration, and, lawmaking, in, the, gdr, through, the, soviet, embassy, and, through, the, implicit, threat, of, force, which, could, be, exercised, through, the, continuing, large, soviet, military, presence, in, the, gdr, which, was, used, to, repress, protests, in, east, germany, bloodily, in, june, 1953, east, germany, differed, from, west, germany, federal, republic, of, germany, which, developed, into, a, western, capitalist, country, with, a, social, market, economy, and, a, democratic, parliamentary, government, continual, economic, growth, starting, in, the, 1950s, fueled, a, 20, year, economic, miracle, wirtschaftswunder, as, west, germany, s, economy, grew, and, its, standard, of, living, steadily, improved, many, east, germans, wanted, to, move, to, west, germany, after, the, soviet, occupation, of, eastern, europe, at, the, end, of, world, war, ii, the, majority, of, those, living, in, the, newly, acquired, areas, of, the, eastern, bloc, aspired, to, independence, and, wanted, the, soviets, to, leave, taking, advantage, of, the, zonal, border, between, occupied, zones, in, germany, the, number, of, gdr, citizens, moving, to, west, germany, totaled, 187, 000, in, 1950, 165, 000, in, 1951, 182, 000, in, 1952, and, 331, 000, in, 1953, one, reason, for, the, sharp, 1953, increase, was, fear, of, potential, further, sovietization, given, the, increasingly, paranoid, actions, of, joseph, stalin, in, late, 1952, and, early, 1953, in, the, first, six, months, of, 1953, 226, 000, had, fled, by, the, early, 1950s, the, soviet, approach, to, controlling, national, movement, restricting, emigration, was, emulated, by, most, of, the, rest, of, the, eastern, bloc, including, east, germany, the, restrictions, presented, a, quandary, for, some, eastern, bloc, states, which, had, been, more, economically, advanced, and, open, than, the, soviet, union, such, that, crossing, borders, seemed, more, natural, especially, where, no, prior, border, existed, between, east, and, west, germany, up, until, 1952, the, demarcation, lines, between, east, germany, and, the, western, occupied, zones, could, be, easily, crossed, in, most, places, on, 1, april, 1952, east, german, leaders, met, the, soviet, leader, joseph, stalin, in, moscow, during, the, discussions, stalin, s, foreign, minister, vyacheslav, molotov, proposed, that, the, east, germans, should, introduce, a, system, of, passes, for, visits, of, west, berlin, residents, to, the, territory, of, east, berlin, free, movement, of, western, agents, in, the, gdr, stalin, agreed, calling, the, situation, intolerable, he, advised, the, east, germans, to, build, up, their, border, defenses, telling, them, that, the, demarcation, line, between, east, and, west, germany, should, be, considered, a, border, and, not, just, any, border, but, a, dangerous, one, the, germans, will, guard, the, line, of, defence, with, their, lives, consequently, the, inner, german, border, between, the, two, german, states, was, closed, and, a, barbed, wire, fence, erected, the, border, between, the, western, and, eastern, sectors, of, berlin, however, remained, open, although, traffic, between, the, soviet, and, the, western, sectors, was, somewhat, restricted, this, resulted, in, berlin, becoming, a, magnet, for, east, germans, desperate, to, escape, life, in, the, gdr, and, also, a, flashpoint, for, tension, between, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, in, 1955, the, soviets, gave, east, germany, authority, over, civilian, movement, in, berlin, passing, control, to, a, regime, not, recognized, in, the, west, initially, east, germany, granted, visits, to, allow, its, residents, access, to, west, germany, however, following, the, defection, of, large, numbers, of, east, germans, known, as, republikflucht, under, this, regime, the, new, east, german, state, legally, restricted, virtually, all, travel, to, the, west, in, 1956, soviet, east, german, ambassador, mikhail, pervukhin, observed, that, the, presence, in, berlin, of, an, open, and, essentially, uncontrolled, border, between, the, socialist, and, capitalist, worlds, unwittingly, prompts, the, population, to, make, a, comparison, between, both, parts, of, the, city, which, unfortunately, does, not, always, turn, out, in, favour, of, democratic, berlin, with, the, closing, of, the, inner, german, border, officially, in, 1952, the, border, in, berlin, remained, considerably, more, accessible, because, it, was, administered, by, all, four, occupying, powers, accordingly, berlin, became, the, main, route, by, which, east, germans, left, for, the, west, on, 11, december, 1957, east, germany, introduced, a, new, passport, law, that, reduced, the, overall, number, of, refugees, leaving, eastern, germany, it, had, the, unintended, result, of, drastically, increasing, the, percentage, of, those, leaving, through, west, berlin, from, 60, to, well, over, 90, by, the, end, of, 1958, those, caught, trying, to, leave, east, berlin, were, subjected, to, heavy, penalties, but, with, no, physical, barrier, and, subway, train, access, still, available, to, west, berlin, such, measures, were, ineffective, the, berlin, sector, border, was, essentially, a, loophole, through, which, eastern, bloc, citizens, could, still, escape, the, 3, 5, million, east, germans, who, had, left, by, 1961, totalled, approximately, 20, of, the, entire, east, german, population, an, important, reason, that, passage, between, east, germany, and, west, berlin, was, not, stopped, earlier, was, that, doing, so, would, cut, off, much, of, the, railway, traffic, in, east, germany, construction, of, a, new, railway, bypassing, west, berlin, the, berlin, outer, ring, commenced, in, 1951, following, the, completion, of, the, railway, in, 1961, closing, the, border, became, a, more, practical, proposition, the, emigrants, tended, to, be, young, and, well, educated, leading, to, the, brain, drain, feared, by, officials, in, east, germany, yuri, andropov, then, the, cpsu, director, on, relations, with, communist, and, workers, parties, of, socialist, countries, wrote, an, urgent, letter, on, 28, august, 1958, to, the, central, committee, about, the, significant, 50, increase, in, the, number, of, east, german, intelligentsia, among, the, refugees, andropov, reported, that, while, the, east, german, leadership, stated, that, they, were, leaving, for, economic, reasons, testimony, from, refugees, indicated, that, the, reasons, were, more, political, than, material, he, stated, the, flight, of, the, intelligentsia, has, reached, a, particularly, critical, phase, by, 1960, the, combination, of, world, war, ii, and, the, massive, emigration, westward, left, east, germany, with, only, 61, of, its, population, of, working, age, compared, to, 70, 5, before, the, war, the, loss, was, disproportionately, heavy, among, professionals, engineers, technicians, physicians, teachers, lawyers, and, skilled, workers, the, direct, cost, of, manpower, losses, to, east, germany, and, corresponding, gain, to, the, west, has, been, estimated, at, 7, billion, to, 9, billion, with, east, german, party, leader, walter, ulbricht, later, claiming, that, west, germany, owed, him, 17, billion, in, compensation, including, reparations, as, well, as, manpower, losses, in, addition, the, drain, of, east, germany, s, young, population, potentially, cost, it, over, 22, 5, billion, marks, in, lost, educational, investment, the, brain, drain, of, professionals, had, become, so, damaging, to, the, political, credibility, and, economic, viability, of, east, germany, that, the, re, securing, of, the, german, communist, frontier, was, imperative, the, exodus, of, emigrants, from, east, germany, presented, two, minor, potential, benefits, an, easy, way, to, smuggle, east, german, secret, agents, to, west, germany, and, a, reduction, in, the, number, of, citizens, hostile, to, the, communist, regime, neither, of, these, advantages, however, proved, particularly, useful, on, 15, june, 1961, first, secretary, of, the, socialist, unity, party, and, gdr, state, council, chairman, walter, ulbricht, stated, in, an, international, press, conference, niemand, hat, die, absicht, eine, mauer, zu, errichten, no, one, has, the, intention, of, erecting, a, wall, it, was, the, first, time, the, colloquial, term, mauer, wall, had, been, used, in, this, context, the, transcript, of, a, telephone, call, between, nikita, khrushchev, and, ulbricht, on, 1, august, in, the, same, year, suggests, that, the, initiative, for, the, construction, of, the, wall, came, from, khrushchev, however, other, sources, suggest, that, khrushchev, had, initially, been, wary, about, building, a, wall, fearing, negative, western, reaction, nevertheless, ulbricht, had, pushed, for, a, border, closure, for, some, time, arguing, that, east, germany, s, existence, was, at, stake, khrushchev, had, become, emboldened, upon, seeing, us, president, john, f, kennedy, s, youth, and, inexperience, which, he, considered, a, weakness, in, the, 1961, vienna, summit, kennedy, made, the, error, of, admitting, that, the, us, would, not, actively, oppose, the, building, of, a, barrier, a, feeling, of, miscalculation, and, failure, immediately, afterwards, was, admitted, by, kennedy, in, a, candid, interview, with, new, york, times, columnist, james, scotty, reston, on, saturday, 12, august, 1961, the, leaders, of, the, gdr, attended, a, garden, party, at, a, government, guesthouse, in, d, llnsee, in, a, wooded, area, to, the, north, of, east, berlin, there, ulbricht, signed, the, order, to, close, the, border, and, erect, a, wall, at, midnight, the, police, and, units, of, the, east, german, army, began, to, close, the, border, and, by, sunday, morning, 13, august, the, border, with, west, berlin, was, closed, east, german, troops, and, workers, had, begun, to, tear, up, streets, running, alongside, the, border, to, make, them, impassable, to, most, vehicles, and, to, install, barbed, wire, entanglements, and, fences, along, the, 156, km, 97, mi, around, the, three, western, sectors, and, the, 43, km, 27, mi, that, divided, west, and, east, berlin, the, date, of, 13, august, became, commonly, referred, to, as, barbed, wire, sunday, in, germany, the, barrier, was, built, inside, east, berlin, on, east, german, territory, to, ensure, that, it, did, not, encroach, on, west, berlin, at, any, point, generally, the, wall, was, only, slightly, inside, east, berlin, but, in, a, few, places, it, was, some, distance, from, the, legal, border, most, notably, at, potsdamer, bahnhof, and, the, lenn, triangle, that, is, now, much, of, the, potsdamer, platz, development, later, the, initial, barrier, was, built, up, into, the, wall, proper, the, first, concrete, elements, and, large, blocks, being, put, in, place, on, 17, august, during, the, construction, of, the, wall, national, people, s, army, nva, and, combat, groups, of, the, working, class, kda, soldiers, stood, in, front, of, it, with, orders, to, shoot, anyone, who, attempted, to, defect, additionally, chain, fences, walls, minefields, and, other, obstacles, were, installed, along, the, length, of, east, germany, s, western, border, with, west, germany, proper, a, wide, no, man, s, land, was, cleared, as, well, to, provide, a, better, overview, and, a, clear, line, of, fire, at, fleeing, refugees, with, the, closing, of, the, east, west, sector, boundary, in, berlin, the, vast, majority, of, east, germans, could, no, longer, travel, or, emigrate, to, west, germany, berlin, soon, went, from, being, the, easiest, place, to, make, an, unauthorized, crossing, between, east, and, west, germany, to, being, the, most, difficult, many, families, were, split, while, east, berliners, employed, in, the, west, were, cut, off, from, their, jobs, west, berlin, became, an, isolated, exclave, in, a, hostile, land, west, berliners, demonstrated, against, the, wall, led, by, their, mayor, oberb, rgermeister, willy, brandt, who, criticized, the, united, states, for, failing, to, respond, and, went, so, far, as, to, suggest, to, washington, what, to, do, next, kennedy, was, furious, allied, intelligence, agencies, had, hypothesized, about, a, wall, to, stop, the, flood, of, refugees, but, the, main, candidate, for, its, location, was, around, the, perimeter, of, the, city, in, 1961, secretary, of, state, dean, rusk, proclaimed, the, wall, certainly, ought, not, to, be, a, permanent, feature, of, the, european, landscape, i, see, no, reason, why, the, soviet, union, should, think, it, is, to, their, advantage, in, any, way, to, leave, there, that, monument, to, communist, failure, united, states, and, uk, sources, had, expected, the, soviet, sector, to, be, sealed, off, from, west, berlin, but, were, surprised, by, how, long, the, east, germans, took, for, such, a, move, they, considered, the, wall, as, an, end, to, concerns, about, a, gdr, soviet, retaking, or, capture, of, the, whole, of, berlin, the, wall, would, presumably, have, been, an, unnecessary, project, if, such, plans, were, afloat, thus, they, concluded, that, the, possibility, of, a, soviet, military, conflict, over, berlin, had, decreased, the, east, german, government, claimed, that, the, wall, was, an, anti, fascist, protective, rampart, german, antifaschistischer, schutzwall, intended, to, dissuade, aggression, from, the, west, another, official, justification, was, the, activities, of, western, agents, in, eastern, europe, the, eastern, german, government, also, claimed, that, west, berliners, were, buying, out, state, subsidized, goods, in, east, berlin, east, germans, and, others, greeted, such, statements, with, skepticism, as, most, of, the, time, the, border, was, only, closed, for, citizens, of, east, germany, traveling, to, the, west, but, not, for, residents, of, west, berlin, travelling, to, the, east, the, construction, of, the, wall, had, caused, considerable, hardship, to, families, divided, by, it, most, people, believed, that, the, wall, was, mainly, a, means, of, preventing, the, citizens, of, east, germany, from, entering, or, fleeing, to, west, berlin, the, national, security, agency, was, the, only, american, intelligence, agency, that, was, aware, that, east, germany, was, to, take, action, to, deal, with, the, brain, drain, problem, on, 9, august, 1961, the, nsa, intercepted, an, advance, warning, information, of, the, socialist, unity, party, s, plan, to, close, the, intra, berlin, border, between, east, and, west, berlin, completely, for, foot, traffic, the, interagency, intelligence, berlin, watch, committee, assessed, that, this, intercept, might, be, the, first, step, in, a, plan, to, close, the, border, this, warning, did, not, reach, john, f, kennedy, until, noon, on, 13, august, 1961, while, he, was, vacationing, in, his, yacht, off, the, kennedy, compound, in, hyannis, port, massachusetts, while, kennedy, was, angry, that, he, had, no, advance, warning, he, was, relieved, that, the, east, germans, and, the, soviets, had, only, divided, berlin, without, taking, any, action, against, west, berlin, s, access, to, the, west, however, he, denounced, the, berlin, wall, whose, erection, worsened, the, relations, between, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, in, response, to, the, erection, of, the, berlin, wall, a, retired, general, lucius, d, clay, was, appointed, by, kennedy, as, his, special, advisor, with, ambassadorial, rank, clay, had, been, the, military, governor, of, the, us, zone, of, occupation, in, germany, during, the, period, of, the, berlin, blockade, and, had, ordered, the, first, measures, in, what, became, the, berlin, airlift, he, was, immensely, popular, with, the, residents, of, west, berlin, and, his, appointment, was, an, unambiguous, sign, that, kennedy, would, not, compromise, on, the, status, of, west, berlin, as, a, symbolic, gesture, kennedy, sent, clay, and, vice, president, lyndon, b, johnson, to, west, berlin, they, landed, at, tempelhof, airport, on, the, afternoon, of, saturday, 19, august, 1961, and, were, greeted, enthusiastically, by, the, local, population, they, arrived, in, a, city, defended, by, three, allied, brigades, one, each, from, the, uk, berlin, infantry, brigade, the, us, berlin, brigade, and, france, forces, fran, aises, berlin, on, 16, august, kennedy, had, given, the, order, for, them, to, be, reinforced, early, on, 19, august, the, 1st, battle, group, 18th, infantry, regiment, commanded, by, colonel, glover, s, johns, jr, was, alerted, on, sunday, morning, u, s, troops, marched, from, west, germany, through, east, germany, bound, for, west, berlin, lead, elements, arranged, in, a, column, of, 491, vehicles, and, trailers, carrying, 1, 500, men, divided, into, five, march, units, left, the, helmstedt, marienborn, checkpoint, at, 06, 34, at, marienborn, the, soviet, checkpoint, next, to, helmstedt, on, the, west, german, east, german, border, us, personnel, were, counted, by, guards, the, column, was, 160, km, 99, mi, long, and, covered, 177, km, 110, mi, from, marienborn, to, berlin, in, full, battle, gear, east, german, police, watched, from, beside, trees, next, to, the, autobahn, all, the, way, along, the, front, of, the, convoy, arrived, at, the, outskirts, of, berlin, just, before, noon, to, be, met, by, clay, and, johnson, before, parading, through, the, streets, of, berlin, in, front, of, a, large, crowd, at, 04, 00, on, 21, august, lyndon, johnson, left, west, berlin, in, the, hands, of, general, frederick, o, hartel, and, his, brigade, of, 4, 224, officers, and, men, for, the, next, three, and, a, half, years, american, battalions, would, rotate, into, west, berlin, by, autobahn, at, three, month, intervals, to, demonstrate, allied, rights, to, the, city, the, creation, of, the, wall, had, important, implications, for, both, german, states, by, stemming, the, exodus, of, people, from, east, germany, the, east, german, government, was, able, to, reassert, its, control, over, the, country, despite, discontent, with, the, wall, economic, problems, caused, by, dual, currency, and, the, black, market, were, largely, eliminated, the, economy, in, the, gdr, began, to, grow, however, the, wall, proved, a, public, relations, disaster, for, the, communist, bloc, as, a, whole, western, powers, portrayed, it, as, a, symbol, of, communist, tyranny, particularly, after, east, german, border, guards, shot, and, killed, would, be, defectors, such, fatalities, were, later, treated, as, acts, of, murder, by, the, reunified, germany, the, berlin, wall, was, more, than, 140, kilometres, 87, mi, long, in, june, 1962, a, second, parallel, fence, also, known, as, a, hinterland, wall, inner, wall, was, built, some, 100, m, 110, yd, farther, into, east, german, territory, the, houses, contained, between, the, wall, and, fences, were, razed, and, the, inhabitants, relocated, thus, establishing, what, later, became, known, as, the, death, strip, the, death, strip, was, covered, with, raked, sand, or, gravel, rendering, footprints, easy, to, notice, easing, the, detection, of, trespassers, and, also, enabling, officers, to, see, which, guards, had, neglected, their, task, it, offered, no, cover, and, most, importantly, it, offered, clear, fields, of, fire, for, the, wall, guards, through, the, years, the, berlin, wall, evolved, through, four, versions, the, fourth, generation, wall, known, officially, as, st, tzwandelement, ul, 12, 11, retaining, wall, element, ul, 12, 11, was, the, final, and, most, sophisticated, version, of, the, wall, begun, in, 1975, and, completed, about, 1980, it, was, constructed, from, 45, 000, separate, sections, of, reinforced, concrete, each, 3, 6, metres, 12, ft, high, and, 1, 2, m, 3, 9, ft, wide, and, cost, ddm, 16, 155, 000, or, about, us, 3, 638, 000, the, concrete, provisions, added, to, this, version, of, the, wall, were, done, to, prevent, escapees, from, driving, their, cars, through, the, barricades, at, strategic, points, the, wall, was, constructed, to, a, somewhat, weaker, standard, so, that, east, german, and, soviet, armored, vehicles, could, easily, break, through, in, the, event, of, war, the, top, of, the, wall, was, lined, with, a, smooth, pipe, intended, to, make, it, more, difficult, to, scale, the, wall, was, reinforced, by, mesh, fencing, signal, fencing, anti, vehicle, trenches, barbed, wire, dogs, on, long, lines, beds, of, nails, also, known, as, stalin, s, carpet, under, balconies, hanging, over, the, death, strip, over, 116, watchtowers, and, 20, bunkers, with, hundreds, of, guards, this, version, of, the, wall, is, the, one, most, commonly, seen, in, photographs, and, surviving, fragments, of, the, wall, in, berlin, and, elsewhere, around, the, world, are, generally, pieces, of, the, fourth, generation, wall, the, layout, came, to, resemble, the, inner, german, border, in, most, technical, aspects, except, that, the, berlin, wall, had, no, landmines, nor, spring, guns, maintenance, was, performed, on, the, outside, of, the, wall, by, personnel, who, accessed, the, area, outside, it, either, via, ladders, or, via, hidden, doors, within, the, wall, these, doors, could, not, be, opened, by, a, single, person, needing, two, separate, keys, in, two, separate, keyholes, to, unlock, as, was, the, case, with, the, inner, german, border, an, unfortified, strip, of, eastern, territory, was, left, outside, the, wall, this, outer, strip, was, used, by, workers, to, paint, over, graffiti, and, perform, other, maintenance, on, the, outside, of, the, wall, unlike, the, inner, german, border, however, the, outer, strip, was, usually, no, more, than, four, meters, wide, and, in, photos, from, the, era, the, exact, location, of, the, actual, border, in, many, places, appears, not, even, to, have, been, marked, also, in, contrast, with, the, inner, german, border, little, interest, was, shown, by, east, german, law, enforcement, in, keeping, outsiders, off, the, outer, strip, sidewalks, of, west, berlin, streets, even, ran, inside, it, despite, the, east, german, government, s, general, policy, of, benign, neglect, vandals, were, known, to, have, been, pursued, in, the, outer, strip, and, even, arrested, in, 1986, defector, and, political, activist, wolfram, hasch, and, four, other, defectors, were, standing, inside, the, outer, strip, defacing, the, wall, when, east, german, personnel, emerged, from, one, of, the, hidden, doors, to, apprehend, them, all, but, hasch, escaped, back, into, the, western, sector, hasch, himself, was, arrested, dragged, through, the, door, into, the, death, strip, and, later, convicted, of, illegally, crossing, the, de, jure, border, outside, the, wall, graffiti, artist, thierry, noir, has, reported, having, often, been, pursued, there, by, east, german, soldiers, while, some, graffiti, artists, were, chased, off, the, outer, strip, others, such, as, keith, haring, were, seemingly, tolerated, besides, the, sector, sector, boundary, within, berlin, itself, the, wall, also, separated, west, berlin, from, the, present, day, state, of, brandenburg, the, following, present, day, municipalities, listed, in, counter, clockwise, direction, share, a, border, with, the, former, west, berlin, there, were, nine, border, crossings, between, east, and, west, berlin, these, allowed, visits, by, west, berliners, other, west, germans, western, foreigners, and, allied, personnel, into, east, berlin, as, well, as, visits, by, gdr, citizens, and, citizens, of, other, socialist, countries, into, west, berlin, provided, that, they, held, the, necessary, permits, these, crossings, were, restricted, according, to, which, nationality, was, allowed, to, use, it, east, germans, west, germans, west, berliners, other, countries, the, best, known, was, the, vehicle, and, pedestrian, checkpoint, at, the, corner, of, friedrichstra, e, and, zimmerstra, e, checkpoint, charlie, which, was, restricted, to, allied, personnel, and, foreigners, several, other, border, crossings, existed, between, west, berlin, and, surrounding, east, germany, these, could, be, used, for, transit, between, west, germany, and, west, berlin, for, visits, by, west, berliners, into, east, germany, for, transit, into, countries, neighbouring, east, germany, poland, czechoslovakia, and, denmark, and, for, visits, by, east, germans, into, west, berlin, carrying, a, permit, after, the, 1972, agreements, new, crossings, were, opened, to, allow, west, berlin, waste, to, be, transported, into, east, german, dumps, as, well, as, some, crossings, for, access, to, west, berlin, s, exclaves, see, steinst, cken, four, autobahns, connected, west, berlin, to, west, germany, including, berlin, helmstedt, autobahn, which, entered, east, german, territory, between, the, towns, of, helmstedt, and, marienborn, checkpoint, alpha, and, which, entered, west, berlin, at, dreilinden, checkpoint, bravo, for, the, allied, forces, in, southwestern, berlin, access, to, west, berlin, was, also, possible, by, railway, four, routes, and, by, boat, for, commercial, shipping, via, canals, and, rivers, non, german, westerners, could, cross, the, border, at, friedrichstra, e, station, in, east, berlin, and, at, checkpoint, charlie, when, the, wall, was, erected, berlin, s, complex, public, transit, networks, the, s, bahn, and, u, bahn, were, divided, with, it, some, lines, were, cut, in, half, many, stations, were, shut, down, three, western, lines, traveled, through, brief, sections, of, east, berlin, territory, passing, through, eastern, stations, called, geisterbahnh, fe, or, ghost, stations, without, stopping, both, the, eastern, and, western, networks, converged, at, friedrichstra, e, which, became, a, major, crossing, point, for, those, mostly, westerners, with, permission, to, cross, west, germans, and, citizens, of, other, western, countries, could, generally, visit, east, germany, often, after, applying, for, a, visa, at, an, east, german, embassy, several, weeks, in, advance, visas, for, day, trips, restricted, to, east, berlin, were, issued, without, previous, application, in, a, simplified, procedure, at, the, border, crossing, however, east, german, authorities, could, refuse, entry, permits, without, stating, a, reason, in, the, 1980s, visitors, from, the, western, part, of, the, city, who, wanted, to, visit, the, eastern, part, had, to, exchange, at, least, dm, 25, into, east, german, currency, at, the, poor, exchange, rate, of, 1, 1, it, was, forbidden, to, export, east, german, currency, from, the, east, but, money, not, spent, could, be, left, at, the, border, for, possible, future, visits, tourists, crossing, from, the, west, had, to, also, pay, for, a, visa, which, cost, dm, 5, west, berliners, did, not, have, to, pay, this, fee, west, berliners, initially, could, not, visit, east, berlin, or, east, germany, at, all, all, crossing, points, were, closed, to, them, between, 26, august, 1961, and, 17, december, 1963, in, 1963, negotiations, between, east, and, west, resulted, in, a, limited, possibility, for, visits, during, the, christmas, season, that, year, passierscheinregelung, similar, very, limited, arrangements, were, made, in, 1964, 1965, and, 1966, in, 1971, with, the, four, power, agreement, on, berlin, agreements, were, reached, that, allowed, west, berliners, to, apply, for, visas, to, enter, east, berlin, and, east, germany, regularly, comparable, to, the, regulations, already, in, force, for, west, germans, however, east, german, authorities, could, still, refuse, entry, permits, east, berliners, and, east, germans, could, not, at, first, travel, to, west, berlin, or, west, germany, at, all, this, regulation, remained, in, force, essentially, until, the, fall, of, the, wall, but, over, the, years, several, exceptions, to, these, rules, were, introduced, the, most, significant, being, for, each, of, these, exceptions, gdr, citizens, had, to, apply, for, individual, approval, which, was, never, guaranteed, in, addition, even, if, travel, was, approved, gdr, travellers, could, exchange, only, a, very, small, number, of, east, german, marks, into, deutsche, marks, dm, thus, limiting, the, financial, resources, available, for, them, to, travel, to, the, west, this, led, to, the, west, german, practice, of, granting, a, small, amount, of, dm, annually, begr, ungsgeld, or, welcome, money, to, gdr, citizens, visiting, west, germany, and, west, berlin, to, help, alleviate, this, situation, citizens, of, other, east, european, countries, were, in, general, subject, to, the, same, prohibition, of, visiting, western, countries, as, east, germans, though, the, applicable, exception, if, any, varied, from, country, to, country, allied, military, personnel, and, civilian, officials, of, the, allied, forces, could, enter, and, exit, east, berlin, without, submitting, to, east, german, passport, controls, purchasing, a, visa, or, being, required, to, exchange, money, likewise, soviet, military, patrols, could, enter, and, exit, west, berlin, this, was, a, requirement, of, the, post, war, four, powers, agreements, a, particular, area, of, concern, for, the, western, allies, involved, official, dealings, with, east, german, authorities, when, crossing, the, border, since, allied, policy, did, not, recognize, the, authority, of, the, gdr, to, regulate, allied, military, traffic, to, and, from, west, berlin, as, well, as, the, allied, presence, within, greater, berlin, including, entry, into, exit, from, and, presence, within, east, berlin, the, allies, held, that, only, the, soviet, union, and, not, the, gdr, had, the, authority, to, regulate, allied, personnel, in, such, cases, for, this, reason, elaborate, procedures, were, established, to, prevent, inadvertent, recognition, of, east, german, authority, when, engaged, in, travel, through, the, gdr, and, when, in, east, berlin, special, rules, applied, to, travel, by, western, allied, military, personnel, assigned, to, the, military, liaison, missions, accredited, to, the, commander, of, soviet, forces, in, east, germany, located, in, potsdam, allied, personnel, were, restricted, by, policy, when, travelling, by, land, to, the, following, routes, as, with, military, personnel, special, procedures, applied, to, travel, by, diplomatic, personnel, of, the, western, allies, accredited, to, their, respective, embassies, in, the, gdr, this, was, intended, to, prevent, inadvertent, recognition, of, east, german, authority, when, crossing, between, east, and, west, berlin, which, could, jeopardize, the, overall, allied, position, governing, the, freedom, of, movement, by, allied, forces, personnel, within, all, berlin, ordinary, citizens, of, the, western, allied, powers, not, formally, affiliated, with, the, allied, forces, were, authorized, to, use, all, designated, transit, routes, through, east, germany, to, and, from, west, berlin, regarding, travel, to, east, berlin, such, persons, could, also, use, the, friedrichstra, e, train, station, to, enter, and, exit, the, city, in, addition, to, checkpoint, charlie, in, these, instances, such, travelers, unlike, allied, personnel, had, to, submit, to, east, german, border, controls, during, the, years, of, the, wall, around, 5, 000, people, successfully, defected, to, west, berlin, the, number, of, people, who, died, trying, to, cross, the, wall, or, as, a, result, of, the, wall, s, existence, has, been, disputed, the, most, vocal, claims, by, alexandra, hildebrandt, director, of, the, checkpoint, charlie, museum, and, widow, of, the, museum, s, founder, estimated, the, death, toll, to, be, well, above, 200, a, historic, research, group, at, the, centre, for, contemporary, history, zzf, in, potsdam, has, confirmed, at, least, 140, deaths, prior, official, figures, listed, 98, as, being, killed, the, east, german, government, issued, shooting, orders, schie, befehl, to, border, guards, dealing, with, defectors, though, such, orders, are, not, the, same, as, shoot, to, kill, orders, gdr, officials, denied, issuing, the, latter, in, an, october, 1973, order, later, discovered, by, researchers, guards, were, instructed, that, people, attempting, to, cross, the, wall, were, criminals, and, needed, to, be, shot, do, not, hesitate, to, use, your, firearm, not, even, when, the, border, is, breached, in, the, company, of, women, and, children, which, is, a, tactic, the, traitors, have, often, used, early, successful, escapes, involved, people, jumping, the, initial, barbed, wire, or, leaping, out, of, apartment, windows, along, the, line, but, these, ended, as, the, wall, was, fortified, east, german, authorities, no, longer, permitted, apartments, near, the, wall, to, be, occupied, and, any, building, near, the, wall, had, its, windows, boarded, and, later, bricked, up, on, 15, august, 1961, conrad, schumann, was, the, first, east, german, border, guard, to, escape, by, jumping, the, barbed, wire, to, west, berlin, on, 22, august, 1961, ida, siekmann, was, the, first, casualty, at, the, berlin, wall, she, died, after, she, jumped, out, of, her, third, floor, apartment, at, 48, bernauer, strasse, the, first, person, to, be, shot, and, killed, while, trying, to, cross, to, west, berlin, was, g, nter, litfin, a, twenty, four, year, old, tailor, he, attempted, to, swim, across, the, spree, to, west, berlin, on, 24, august, 1961, the, same, day, that, east, german, police, had, received, shoot, to, kill, orders, to, prevent, anyone, from, escaping, another, dramatic, escape, was, carried, out, in, april, 1963, by, wolfgang, engels, a, 19, year, old, civilian, employee, of, the, nationale, volksarmee, nva, engels, stole, a, soviet, armored, personnel, carrier, from, a, base, where, he, was, deployed, and, drove, it, right, into, the, wall, he, was, fired, at, and, seriously, wounded, by, border, guards, but, a, west, german, policeman, intervened, firing, his, weapon, at, the, east, german, border, guards, the, policeman, removed, engels, from, the, vehicle, which, had, become, entangled, in, the, barbed, wire, east, germans, successfully, defected, by, a, variety, of, methods, digging, long, tunnels, under, the, wall, waiting, for, favorable, winds, and, taking, a, hot, air, balloon, sliding, along, aerial, wires, flying, ultralights, and, in, one, instance, simply, driving, a, sports, car, at, full, speed, through, the, basic, initial, fortifications, when, a, metal, beam, was, placed, at, checkpoints, to, prevent, this, kind, of, defection, up, to, four, people, two, in, the, front, seats, and, possibly, two, in, the, boot, drove, under, the, bar, in, a, sports, car, that, had, been, modified, to, allow, the, roof, and, windscreen, to, come, away, when, it, made, contact, with, the, beam, they, lay, flat, and, kept, driving, forward, the, east, germans, then, built, zig, zagging, roads, at, checkpoints, the, sewer, system, predated, the, wall, and, some, people, escaped, through, the, sewers, in, a, number, of, cases, with, assistance, from, the, unternehmen, reiseb, ro, in, september, 1962, 29, people, escaped, through, a, tunnel, to, the, west, at, least, 70, tunnels, were, dug, under, the, wall, only, 19, were, successful, in, allowing, fugitives, about, 400, persons, to, escape, the, east, german, authorities, eventually, used, seismographic, and, acoustic, equipment, to, detect, the, practice, in, 1962, they, planned, an, attempt, to, use, explosives, to, destroy, one, tunnel, but, this, was, not, carried, out, as, it, was, apparently, sabotaged, by, a, member, of, the, stasi, an, airborne, escape, was, made, by, thomas, kr, ger, who, landed, a, zlin, z, 42, m, light, aircraft, of, the, gesellschaft, f, r, sport, und, technik, an, east, german, youth, military, training, organization, at, raf, gatow, his, aircraft, registration, ddr, woh, was, dismantled, and, returned, to, the, east, germans, by, road, complete, with, humorous, slogans, painted, on, it, by, airmen, of, the, royal, air, force, such, as, wish, you, were, here, and, come, back, soon, if, an, escapee, was, wounded, in, a, crossing, attempt, and, lay, on, the, death, strip, no, matter, how, close, they, were, to, the, western, wall, westerners, could, not, intervene, for, fear, of, triggering, engaging, fire, from, the, grepos, the, east, berlin, border, guards, the, guards, often, let, fugitives, bleed, to, death, in, the, middle, of, this, ground, as, in, the, most, notorious, failed, attempt, that, of, peter, fechter, aged, 18, at, a, point, near, zimmerstrasse, in, east, berlin, he, was, shot, and, bled, to, death, in, full, view, of, the, western, media, on, 17, august, 1962, fechter, s, death, created, negative, publicity, worldwide, that, led, the, leaders, of, east, berlin, to, place, more, restrictions, on, shooting, in, public, places, and, provide, medical, care, for, possible, would, be, escapers, the, last, person, to, be, shot, and, killed, while, trying, to, cross, the, border, was, chris, gueffroy, on, 6, february, 1989, while, the, final, person, to, die, in, an, escape, attempt, was, winfried, freudenberg, who, was, killed, when, his, homemade, natural, gas, filled, balloon, crashed, on, 8, march, 1989, the, wall, gave, rise, to, a, widespread, sense, of, desperation, and, oppression, in, east, berlin, as, expressed, in, the, private, thoughts, of, one, resident, who, confided, to, her, diary, our, lives, have, lost, their, spirit, we, can, do, nothing, to, stop, them, on, 6, june, 1987, david, bowie, who, earlier, for, several, years, lived, and, recorded, in, west, berlin, played, a, concert, close, to, the, wall, this, was, attended, by, thousands, of, eastern, concertgoers, across, the, wall, followed, by, violent, rioting, in, east, berlin, according, to, tobias, ruther, these, protests, in, east, berlin, were, the, first, in, the, sequence, of, riots, that, led, to, those, of, november, 1989, although, other, factors, were, probably, more, influential, in, the, fall, of, the, wall, upon, his, death, in, 2016, the, german, foreign, office, tweeted, good, bye, david, bowie, you, are, now, among, heroes, thank, you, for, helping, to, bring, down, the, wall, on, 19, july, 1988, 16, months, before, the, wall, came, down, bruce, springsteen, and, the, e, street, band, played, rocking, the, wall, a, live, concert, in, east, berlin, which, was, attended, by, 300, 000, in, person, and, broadcast, on, television, springsteen, spoke, to, the, crowd, in, german, saying, i, m, not, here, for, or, against, any, government, i, ve, come, to, play, rock, n, roll, for, you, in, the, hope, that, one, day, all, the, barriers, will, be, torn, down, east, germany, and, its, fdj, youth, organization, were, worried, they, were, losing, an, entire, generation, they, hoped, that, by, letting, springsteen, in, they, could, improve, their, sentiment, among, east, germans, however, this, strategy, of, one, step, backwards, two, steps, forwards, backfired, and, the, concert, only, made, east, germans, hungrier, for, more, of, the, freedoms, that, springsteen, epitomized, while, john, f, kennedy, and, ronald, reagan, delivered, their, famous, speeches, from, the, safety, of, west, berlin, springsteen, s, speaking, out, against, the, wall, in, the, middle, of, east, berlin, added, to, the, euphoria, on, 31, december, 1989, american, tv, actor, and, pop, music, singer, david, hasselhoff, was, the, headlining, performer, for, the, freedom, tour, live, concert, which, was, attended, by, over, 500, 000, people, on, both, sides, of, the, wall, the, live, concert, footage, was, directed, by, music, video, director, thomas, mignone, and, aired, on, broadcast, television, station, zweites, deutsches, fernsehen, zdf, throughout, europe, during, shooting, film, crew, personnel, pulled, people, up, from, both, sides, to, stand, and, celebrate, on, top, of, the, wall, hasselhoff, sang, his, number, one, hit, song, looking, for, freedom, on, a, platform, at, the, end, of, a, twenty, meter, steel, crane, that, swung, above, and, over, the, wall, adjacent, to, the, brandenburg, gate, a, small, museum, was, created, in, 2008, to, celebrate, hasselhoff, in, the, basement, of, the, circus, hostel, on, 26, june, 1963, 22, months, after, the, erection, of, the, berlin, wall, u, s, president, john, f, kennedy, visited, west, berlin, speaking, from, a, platform, erected, on, the, steps, of, rathaus, sch, neberg, for, an, audience, of, 450, 000, and, straying, from, the, prepared, script, he,

proudest, boast, was, civis, romanus, sum, today, in, the, world, of, freedom, the, proudest, boast, is, ich, bin, ein, berliner, all, free, men, wherever, they, may, live, are, citizens, of, berlin, and, therefore, as, a, free, man, i, take, pride, in, the, words, ich, bin, ein, berliner, the, message, was, aimed, as, much, at, the, soviets, as, it, was, at, berliners, and, was, a, clear, statement, of, u, s, policy, in, the, wake, of, the, construction, of, the, berlin, wall, the, speech, is, considered, one, of, kennedy, s, best, both, a, significant, moment, in, the, cold, war, and, a, high, point, of, the, new, frontier, it, was, a, great, morale, boost, for, west, berliners, who, lived, in, an, exclave, deep, inside, east, germany, and, feared, a, possible, east, german, occupation, british, prime, minister, margaret, thatcher, commented, in, 1982, every, stone, bears, witness, to, the, moral, bankruptcy, of, the, society, it, encloses, in, a, speech, at, the, brandenburg, gate, commemorating, the, 750th, anniversary, of, berlin, on, 12, june, 1987, u, s, president, ronald, reagan, challenged, mikhail, gorbachev, then, the, general, secretary, of, the, communist, party, of, the, soviet, union, to, tear, down, the, wall, as, a, symbol, of, increasing, freedom, in, the, eastern, bloc, we, welcome, change, and, openness, for, we, believe, that, freedom, and, security, go, together, that, the, advance, of, human, liberty, can, only, strengthen, the, cause, of, world, peace, there, is, one, sign, the, soviets, can, make, that, would, be, unmistakable, that, would, advance, dramatically, the, cause, of, freedom, and, peace, general, secretary, gorbachev, if, you, seek, peace, if, you, seek, prosperity, for, the, soviet, union, and, eastern, europe, if, you, seek, liberalization, come, here, to, this, gate, mr, gorbachev, open, this, gate, mr, gorbachev, tear, down, this, wall, in, january, 1989, gdr, leader, erich, honecker, predicted, that, the, wall, would, stand, for, 50, or, 100, more, years, if, the, conditions, that, had, caused, its, construction, did, not, change, due, to, the, increasing, economic, problems, in, the, eastern, bloc, and, the, failure, of, the, ussr, to, intervene, in, relation, to, the, individual, communist, states, the, brackets, of, the, eastern, bloc, slowly, began, to, loosen, from, the, end, of, the, 1980s, one, example, is, the, fall, of, the, communist, government, in, neighboring, poland, s, 1989, polish, parliamentary, election, also, in, june, 1989, the, hungarian, government, began, dismantling, the, electrified, fence, along, its, border, with, austria, with, western, tv, crews, present, although, the, border, was, still, very, closely, guarded, and, escape, was, almost, impossible, the, opening, of, a, border, gate, between, austria, and, hungary, at, the, pan, european, picnic, on, 19, august, 1989, which, was, based, on, an, idea, by, otto, von, habsburg, to, test, the, reaction, of, mikhail, gorbachev, then, triggered, a, peaceful, chain, reaction, at, the, end, of, which, there, was, no, longer, the, gdr, and, the, eastern, bloc, had, disintegrated, because, with, the, non, reaction, of, the, ussr, and, the, gdr, to, the, mass, exodus, the, media, informed, eastern, europeans, could, feel, the, increasing, loss, of, power, of, their, governments, and, more, and, more, east, germans, were, now, trying, to, flee, via, hungary, erich, honecker, explained, to, the, daily, mirror, regarding, the, pan, european, picnic, and, thus, showed, his, people, his, own, inaction, habsburg, distributed, leaflets, far, into, poland, on, which, the, east, german, holidaymakers, were, invited, to, a, picnic, when, they, came, to, the, picnic, they, were, given, gifts, food, and, deutsche, mark, and, then, they, were, persuaded, to, come, to, the, west, then, in, september, more, than, 13, 000, east, german, tourists, escaped, through, hungary, to, austria, this, set, up, a, chain, of, events, the, hungarians, prevented, many, more, east, germans, from, crossing, the, border, and, returned, them, to, budapest, these, east, germans, flooded, the, west, german, embassy, and, refused, to, return, to, east, germany, the, east, german, government, responded, by, disallowing, any, further, travel, to, hungary, but, allowed, those, already, there, to, return, to, east, germany, this, triggered, similar, events, in, neighboring, czechoslovakia, this, time, however, the, east, german, authorities, allowed, people, to, leave, provided, that, they, did, so, by, train, through, east, germany, this, was, followed, by, mass, demonstrations, within, east, germany, itself, protest, demonstrations, spread, throughout, east, germany, in, september, 1989, initially, protesters, were, mostly, people, wanting, to, leave, to, the, west, chanting, wir, wollen, raus, we, want, out, then, protestors, began, to, chant, wir, bleiben, hier, we, are, staying, here, this, was, the, start, of, what, east, germans, generally, call, the, peaceful, revolution, of, late, 1989, the, protest, demonstrations, grew, considerably, by, early, november, the, movement, neared, its, height, on, 4, november, when, half, a, million, people, gathered, to, demand, political, change, at, the, alexanderplatz, demonstration, east, berlin, s, large, public, square, and, transportation, hub, on, 9, october, 1989, the, police, and, army, units, were, given, permission, to, use, force, against, those, assembled, but, this, did, not, deter, the, church, service, and, march, from, taking, place, which, gathered, 70, 000, people, the, longtime, leader, of, east, germany, erich, honecker, resigned, on, 18, october, 1989, and, was, replaced, by, egon, krenz, that, day, the, wave, of, refugees, leaving, east, germany, for, the, west, kept, increasing, by, early, november, refugees, were, finding, their, way, to, hungary, via, czechoslovakia, or, via, the, west, german, embassy, in, prague, this, was, tolerated, by, the, new, krenz, government, because, of, long, standing, agreements, with, the, communist, czechoslovak, government, allowing, free, travel, across, their, common, border, however, this, movement, of, people, grew, so, large, it, caused, difficulties, for, both, countries, to, ease, the, difficulties, the, politburo, led, by, krenz, decided, on, 9, november, to, allow, refugees, to, exit, directly, through, crossing, points, between, east, germany, and, west, germany, including, between, east, and, west, berlin, later, the, same, day, the, ministerial, administration, modified, the, proposal, to, include, private, round, trip, and, travel, the, new, regulations, were, to, take, effect, the, next, day, g, nter, schabowski, the, party, boss, in, east, berlin, and, the, spokesman, for, the, sed, politburo, had, the, task, of, announcing, the, new, regulations, however, he, had, not, been, involved, in, the, discussions, about, the, new, regulations, and, had, not, been, fully, updated, shortly, before, a, press, conference, on, 9, november, he, was, handed, a, note, announcing, the, changes, but, given, no, further, instructions, on, how, to, handle, the, information, these, regulations, had, only, been, completed, a, few, hours, earlier, and, were, to, take, effect, the, following, day, so, as, to, allow, time, to, inform, the, border, guards, but, this, starting, time, delay, was, not, communicated, to, schabowski, at, the, end, of, the, press, conference, schabowski, read, out, loud, the, note, he, had, been, given, a, reporter, ansa, s, riccardo, ehrman, asked, when, the, regulations, would, take, effect, after, a, few, seconds, hesitation, schabowski, replied, as, far, as, i, know, it, takes, effect, immediately, without, delay, after, further, questions, from, journalists, he, confirmed, that, the, regulations, included, the, border, crossings, through, the, wall, into, west, berlin, which, he, had, not, mentioned, until, then, he, repeated, that, it, was, immediate, in, an, interview, with, american, journalist, tom, brokaw, excerpts, from, schabowski, s, press, conference, were, the, lead, story, on, west, germany, s, two, main, news, programs, that, night, at, 7, 17, p, m, on, zdf, s, heute, and, at, 8, p, m, on, ard, s, tagesschau, as, ard, and, zdf, had, broadcast, to, nearly, all, of, east, germany, since, the, late, 1950s, and, had, become, accepted, by, the, east, german, authorities, the, news, was, broadcast, there, as, well, simultaneously, later, that, night, on, ard, s, tagesthemen, anchorman, hanns, joachim, friedrichs, proclaimed, this, 9, november, is, a, historic, day, the, gdr, has, announced, that, starting, immediately, its, borders, are, open, to, everyone, the, gates, in, the, wall, stand, open, wide, after, hearing, the, broadcast, east, germans, began, gathering, at, the, wall, at, the, six, checkpoints, between, east, and, west, berlin, demanding, that, border, guards, immediately, open, the, gates, the, surprised, and, overwhelmed, guards, made, many, hectic, telephone, calls, to, their, superiors, about, the, problem, at, first, they, were, ordered, to, find, the, more, aggressive, people, gathered, at, the, gates, and, stamp, their, passports, with, a, special, stamp, that, barred, them, from, returning, to, east, germany, in, effect, revoking, their, citizenship, however, this, still, left, thousands, of, people, demanding, to, be, let, through, as, schabowski, said, we, can, it, soon, became, clear, that, no, one, among, the, east, german, authorities, would, take, personal, responsibility, for, issuing, orders, to, use, lethal, force, so, the, vastly, outnumbered, soldiers, had, no, way, to, hold, back, the, huge, crowd, of, east, german, citizens, finally, at, 10, 45, p, m, on, 9, november, harald, j, ger, the, commander, of, the, bornholmer, stra, e, border, crossing, yielded, allowing, for, the, guards, to, open, the, checkpoints, and, allowing, people, through, with, little, or, no, identity, checking, as, the, ossis, swarmed, through, they, were, greeted, by, wessis, waiting, with, flowers, and, champagne, amid, wild, rejoicing, soon, afterward, a, crowd, of, west, berliners, jumped, on, top, of, the, wall, and, were, soon, joined, by, east, german, youngsters, the, evening, of, 9, november, 1989, is, known, as, the, night, the, wall, came, down, another, border, crossing, to, the, south, may, have, been, opened, earlier, an, account, by, heinz, sch, fer, indicates, that, he, also, acted, independently, and, ordered, the, opening, of, the, gate, at, waltersdorf, rudow, a, couple, of, hours, earlier, this, may, explain, reports, of, east, berliners, appearing, in, west, berlin, earlier, than, the, opening, of, the, bornholmer, stra, e, border, crossing, thirty, years, after, the, fall, of, the, berlin, wall, the, guardian, collected, short, stories, from, 9, november, 1989, by, five, german, writers, who, reflect, on, the, day, in, this, kathrin, schmidt, remembers, comically, i, downed, almost, an, entire, bottle, of, schnapps,
