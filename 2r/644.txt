the, history, of, buddhism, can, be, traced, back, to, the, 5th, century, bce, buddhism, arose, in, ancient, india, in, and, around, the, ancient, kingdom, of, magadha, and, is, based, on, the, teachings, of, the, renunciate, siddh, rtha, gautama, the, religion, evolved, as, it, spread, from, the, northeastern, region, of, the, indian, subcontinent, throughout, central, east, and, southeast, asia, at, one, time, or, another, it, influenced, most, of, asia, the, history, of, buddhism, is, also, characterized, by, the, development, of, numerous, movements, schisms, and, philosophical, schools, among, them, the, therav, da, mah, y, na, and, vajray, na, traditions, with, contrasting, periods, of, expansion, and, retreat, siddh, rtha, gautama, 5th, cent, bce, was, the, historical, founder, of, buddhism, the, early, sources, state, he, was, born, in, the, small, shakya, pali, sakya, republic, which, was, part, of, the, kosala, realm, of, ancient, india, now, in, modern, day, nepal, he, is, thus, also, known, as, the, shakyamuni, literally, the, sage, of, the, shakya, clan, the, early, buddhist, texts, contain, no, continuous, life, of, the, buddha, only, later, after, 200, bce, were, various, biographies, with, much, mythological, embellishment, written, all, texts, agree, however, that, gautama, renounced, the, householder, life, and, lived, as, a, sramana, ascetic, for, some, time, studying, under, various, teachers, before, attaining, nirvana, extinguishment, and, bodhi, awakening, through, meditation, for, the, remaining, 45, years, of, his, life, he, traveled, the, gangetic, plains, of, eastern, central, india, the, region, of, the, ganges, river, and, its, tributaries, teaching, his, doctrine, to, a, diverse, range, of, people, from, different, castes, and, initiating, monks, into, his, order, the, buddha, sent, his, disciples, to, spread, the, teaching, across, india, he, also, initiated, an, order, of, nuns, he, urged, his, disciples, to, teach, in, the, local, language, or, dialects, he, spent, a, lot, of, his, time, near, the, cities, of, s, vatth, r, jagaha, and, ves, l, skt, r, vast, r, jagrha, v, i, al, by, the, time, of, his, death, at, 80, he, had, thousands, of, followers, after, the, death, of, the, buddha, the, buddhist, sangha, monastic, community, remained, centered, on, the, ganges, valley, spreading, gradually, from, its, ancient, heartland, the, canonical, sources, record, various, councils, where, the, monastic, sangha, recited, and, organized, the, orally, transmitted, collections, of, the, buddha, s, teachings, and, settled, certain, disciplinary, problems, within, the, community, modern, scholarship, has, questioned, the, accuracy, and, historicity, of, these, traditional, accounts, the, first, buddhist, council, is, traditionally, said, to, have, been, held, just, after, buddha, s, parinirvana, and, presided, over, by, mah, k, yapa, one, of, his, most, senior, disciples, at, r, jag, ha, today, s, rajgir, with, the, support, of, king, aj, tasattu, according, to, charles, prebish, almost, all, scholars, have, questioned, the, historicity, of, this, first, council, after, an, initial, period, of, unity, divisions, in, the, sangha, or, monastic, community, led, to, the, first, schism, of, the, sangha, into, two, groups, the, sthavira, elders, and, mahasamghika, great, sangha, most, scholars, agree, that, the, schism, was, caused, by, disagreements, over, points, of, vinaya, monastic, discipline, over, time, these, two, monastic, fraternities, would, further, divide, into, various, early, buddhist, schools, lamotte, and, hirakawa, both, maintain, that, the, first, schism, in, the, buddhist, sangha, occurred, during, the, reign, of, ashoka, according, to, scholar, collett, cox, most, scholars, would, agree, that, even, though, the, roots, of, the, earliest, recognized, groups, predate, a, oka, their, actual, separation, did, not, occur, until, after, his, death, according, to, the, theravada, tradition, the, split, took, place, at, the, second, buddhist, council, which, took, place, at, vaishali, approximately, one, hundred, years, after, gautama, buddha, s, parinirv, a, while, the, second, council, probably, was, a, historical, event, traditions, regarding, the, second, council, are, confusing, and, ambiguous, according, to, the, theravada, tradition, the, overall, result, was, the, first, schism, in, the, sangha, between, the, sthavira, nik, ya, and, the, mah, s, ghikas, although, it, is, not, agreed, upon, by, all, what, the, cause, of, this, split, was, the, sthaviras, gave, birth, to, a, large, number, of, influential, schools, including, the, sarv, stiv, da, the, pudgalav, da, also, known, as, vats, putr, ya, the, dharmaguptakas, and, the, vibhajyav, da, the, therav, dins, being, descended, from, these, the, mahasamghikas, meanwhile, also, developed, their, own, schools, and, doctrines, early, on, which, can, be, seen, in, texts, like, the, mahavastu, associated, with, the, lokottarav, da, or, transcendentalist, school, who, might, be, the, same, as, the, ekavy, vah, rikas, or, one, utterancers, this, school, has, been, seen, as, foreshadowing, certain, mahayana, ideas, especially, due, to, their, view, that, all, of, gautama, buddha, s, acts, were, transcendental, or, supramundane, even, those, performed, before, his, buddhahood, in, the, third, century, bce, some, buddhists, began, introducing, new, systematized, teachings, called, abhidharma, based, on, previous, lists, or, tables, matrka, of, main, doctrinal, topics, unlike, the, nikayas, which, were, prose, sutras, or, discourses, the, abhidharma, literature, consisted, of, systematic, doctrinal, exposition, and, often, differed, across, the, buddhist, schools, who, disagreed, on, points, of, doctrine, abhidharma, sought, to, analyze, all, experience, into, its, ultimate, constituents, phenomenal, events, or, processes, called, dharmas, these, texts, further, contributed, to, the, development, of, sectarian, identities, the, various, splits, within, the, monastic, organization, went, together, with, the, introduction, and, emphasis, on, abhidhammic, literature, by, some, schools, this, literature, was, specific, to, each, school, and, arguments, and, disputes, between, the, schools, were, often, based, on, these, abhidhammic, writings, however, actual, splits, were, originally, based, on, disagreements, on, vinaya, monastic, discipline, though, later, on, by, about, 100, ce, or, earlier, they, could, be, based, on, doctrinal, disagreement, pre, sectarian, buddhism, however, did, not, have, abhidhammic, scriptures, except, perhaps, for, a, basic, framework, and, not, all, of, the, early, schools, developed, an, abhidhamma, literature, during, the, reign, of, the, mauryan, emperor, ashoka, 268, 232, bce, buddhism, gained, royal, support, and, began, to, spread, more, widely, reaching, most, of, the, indian, subcontinent, after, his, invasion, of, kalinga, ashoka, seems, to, have, experienced, remorse, and, began, working, to, improve, the, lives, of, his, subjects, ashoka, also, built, wells, rest, houses, and, hospitals, for, humans, and, animals, he, also, abolished, torture, royal, hunting, trips, and, perhaps, even, the, death, penalty, ashoka, also, supported, non, buddhist, faiths, like, jainism, and, brahmanism, ashoka, propagated, religion, by, building, stupas, and, pillars, urging, among, other, things, respect, of, all, animal, life, and, enjoining, people, to, follow, the, dharma, he, has, been, hailed, by, buddhist, sources, as, the, model, for, the, compassionate, chakravartin, wheel, turning, monarch, another, feature, of, mauryan, buddhism, was, the, worship, and, veneration, of, stupas, large, mounds, which, contained, relics, pali, sar, ra, of, the, buddha, or, other, saints, within, it, was, believed, that, the, practice, of, devotion, to, these, relics, and, stupas, could, bring, blessings, perhaps, the, best, preserved, example, of, a, mauryan, buddhist, site, is, the, great, stupa, of, sanchi, dating, from, the, 3rd, century, bce, according, to, the, plates, and, pillars, left, by, a, oka, known, as, the, edicts, of, ashoka, emissaries, were, sent, to, various, countries, in, order, to, spread, buddhism, as, far, south, as, sri, lanka, and, as, far, west, as, the, greek, kingdoms, in, particular, the, neighboring, greco, bactrian, kingdom, and, possibly, even, farther, to, the, mediterranean, theravadin, sources, state, that, ashoka, convened, the, third, buddhist, council, around, 250, bce, at, pataliputra, today, s, patna, with, the, elder, moggaliputtatissa, the, objective, of, the, council, was, to, purify, the, sa, gha, particularly, from, non, buddhist, ascetics, who, had, been, attracted, by, the, royal, patronage, following, the, council, buddhist, missionaries, were, dispatched, throughout, the, known, world, as, is, recorded, in, some, of, the, edicts, of, ashoka, some, of, the, edicts, of, ashoka, describe, the, efforts, made, by, him, to, propagate, the, buddhist, faith, throughout, the, hellenistic, world, which, at, that, time, formed, an, uninterrupted, cultural, continuum, from, the, borders, of, india, to, greece, the, edicts, indicate, a, clear, understanding, of, the, political, organization, in, hellenistic, territories, the, names, and, locations, of, the, main, greek, monarchs, of, the, time, are, identified, and, they, are, claimed, as, recipients, of, buddhist, proselytism, antiochus, ii, theos, of, the, seleucid, kingdom, 261, 246, bce, ptolemy, ii, philadelphos, of, egypt, 285, 247, bce, antigonus, gonatas, of, macedonia, 276, 239, bce, magas, 288, 258, bce, in, cyrenaica, modern, libya, and, alexander, ii, 272, 255, bce, in, epirus, modern, northwestern, greece, one, of, the, edicts, states, furthermore, according, to, the, mahavamsa, xii, some, of, ashoka, s, emissaries, were, greek, yona, particularly, one, named, dhammarakkhita, he, also, issued, edicts, in, the, greek, language, as, well, as, in, aramaic, one, of, them, found, in, kandahar, advocates, the, adoption, of, piety, using, the, greek, term, eusebeia, for, dharma, to, the, greek, community, it, is, not, clear, how, much, these, interactions, may, have, been, influential, but, authors, like, robert, linssen, have, commented, that, buddhism, may, have, influenced, western, thought, and, religion, at, that, time, linssen, points, to, the, presence, of, buddhist, communities, in, the, hellenistic, world, around, that, period, in, particular, in, alexandria, mentioned, by, clement, of, alexandria, and, to, the, pre, christian, monastic, order, of, the, therapeutae, possibly, a, deformation, of, the, p, li, word, therav, da, who, may, have, almost, entirely, drawn, its, inspiration, from, the, teaching, and, practices, of, buddhist, asceticism, and, may, even, have, been, descendants, of, a, oka, s, emissaries, to, the, west, philosophers, like, hegesias, of, cyrene, and, pyrrho, are, sometimes, thought, to, have, been, influenced, by, buddhist, teachings, buddhist, gravestones, from, the, ptolemaic, period, have, also, been, found, in, alexandria, decorated, with, depictions, of, the, dharma, wheel, the, presence, of, buddhists, in, alexandria, has, even, drawn, the, conclusion, that, they, influenced, monastic, christianity, in, the, 2nd, century, ce, the, christian, dogmatist, clement, of, alexandria, recognized, bactrian, ramanas, and, indian, gymnosophists, for, their, influence, on, greek, thought, sri, lankan, chronicles, like, the, dipavamsa, state, that, ashoka, s, son, mahinda, brought, buddhism, to, the, island, during, the, 2nd, century, bce, in, addition, ashoka, s, daughter, sa, ghamitta, also, established, the, bhikkhun, order, for, nuns, in, sri, lanka, also, bringing, with, her, a, sapling, of, the, sacred, bodhi, tree, that, was, subsequently, planted, in, anuradhapura, these, two, figures, are, seen, as, the, mythical, founders, of, the, sri, lankan, theravada, they, are, said, to, have, converted, the, king, devanampiya, tissa, 307, 267, bce, and, many, of, the, nobility, the, first, architectural, records, of, buddha, images, however, actually, come, from, the, reign, of, king, vasabha, 65, 109, ce, the, major, buddhist, monasteries, and, schools, in, ancient, sri, lanka, were, mah, vih, ra, abhayagiri, and, jetavana, the, p, li, canon, was, written, down, during, the, 1st, century, bce, to, preserve, the, teaching, in, a, time, of, war, and, famine, it, is, the, only, complete, collection, of, buddhist, texts, to, survive, in, a, middle, indo, aryan, language, it, reflects, the, tradition, of, the, mahavihara, school, later, pali, mahavihara, commentators, of, the, theravada, such, as, buddhagho, a, 4th, 5th, century, and, dhammap, la, 5th, 6th, century, systematized, the, traditional, sri, lankan, commentary, literature, atthakatha, although, mah, y, na, buddhism, gained, some, influence, in, sri, lanka, as, it, was, studied, in, abhayagiri, and, jetavana, the, mahavihara, great, monastery, school, became, dominant, in, sri, lanka, following, the, reign, of, parakramabahu, i, 1153, 1186, who, abolished, the, abhayagiri, and, jetavanin, traditions, the, buddhist, movement, that, became, known, as, mahayana, great, vehicle, and, also, the, bodhisattvayana, began, sometime, between, 150, bce, and, 100, ce, drawing, on, both, mahasamghika, and, sarvastivada, trends, the, earliest, inscription, which, is, recognizably, mahayana, dates, from, 180, ce, and, is, found, in, mathura, the, mahayana, emphasized, the, bodhisattva, path, to, full, buddhahood, in, contrast, to, the, spiritual, goal, of, arhatship, it, emerged, as, a, set, of, loose, groups, associated, with, new, texts, named, the, mahayana, sutras, the, mahayana, sutras, promoted, new, doctrines, such, as, the, idea, that, there, exist, other, buddhas, who, are, simultaneously, preaching, in, countless, other, world, systems, in, time, mahayana, bodhisattvas, and, also, multiple, buddhas, came, to, be, seen, as, transcendental, beneficent, beings, who, were, subjects, of, devotion, mahayana, remained, a, minority, among, indian, buddhists, for, some, time, growing, slowly, until, about, half, of, all, monks, encountered, by, xuanzang, in, 7th, century, india, were, mahayanists, early, mahayana, schools, of, thought, included, the, m, dhyamaka, yog, c, ra, and, buddha, nature, tath, gatagarbha, teachings, mahayana, is, today, the, dominant, form, of, buddhism, in, east, asia, and, tibet, several, scholars, have, suggested, that, the, praj, p, ramit, s, tras, which, are, among, the, earliest, mah, y, na, s, tras, developed, among, the, mah, s, ghika, along, the, k, a, river, in, the, ndhra, region, of, south, india, the, earliest, mah, y, na, s, tras, to, include, the, very, first, versions, of, the, praj, p, ramit, genre, along, with, texts, concerning, ak, obhya, buddha, which, were, probably, written, down, in, the, 1st, century, bce, in, the, south, of, india, a, k, warder, believes, that, the, mah, y, na, originated, in, the, south, of, india, and, almost, certainly, in, the, ndhra, country, anthony, barber, and, sree, padma, also, trace, mahayana, buddhism, to, ancient, buddhist, sites, in, the, lower, k, a, valley, including, amaravati, stupa, n, g, rjunako, and, jaggayyape, a, the, shunga, dynasty, 185, 73, bce, was, established, about, 50, years, after, ashoka, s, death, after, assassinating, king, brhadrata, last, of, the, mauryan, rulers, military, commander, in, chief, pushyamitra, shunga, took, the, throne, buddhist, religious, scriptures, such, as, the, a, ok, vad, na, allege, that, pushyamitra, an, orthodox, brahmin, was, hostile, towards, buddhists, and, persecuted, the, buddhist, faith, buddhists, wrote, that, he, destroyed, hundreds, of, monasteries, and, killed, hundreds, of, thousands, of, innocent, monks, 840, 000, buddhist, stupas, which, had, been, built, by, ashoka, were, destroyed, and, 100, gold, coins, were, offered, for, the, head, of, each, buddhist, monk, modern, historians, however, dispute, this, view, in, the, light, of, literary, and, archaeological, evidence, they, opine, that, following, ashoka, s, sponsorship, of, buddhism, it, is, possible, that, buddhist, institutions, fell, on, harder, times, under, the, shungas, but, no, evidence, of, active, persecution, has, been, noted, etienne, lamotte, observes, to, judge, from, the, documents, pushyamitra, must, be, acquitted, through, lack, of, proof, another, eminent, historian, romila, thapar, points, to, archaeological, evidence, that, suggests, the, contrary, to, the, claim, that, pushyamitra, was, a, fanatical, anti, buddhist, and, that, he, never, actually, destroyed, 840, 000, stupas, as, claimed, by, buddhist, works, if, any, thapar, stresses, that, buddhist, accounts, are, probably, hyperbolic, renditions, of, pushyamitra, s, attack, of, the, mauryas, and, merely, reflect, the, desperate, frustration, of, the, buddhist, religious, figures, in, the, face, of, the, possibly, irreversible, decline, in, the, importance, of, their, religion, under, the, shungas, during, the, period, buddhist, monks, deserted, the, ganges, valley, following, either, the, northern, road, uttarapatha, or, the, southern, road, dak, inapatha, conversely, buddhist, artistic, creation, stopped, in, the, old, magadha, area, to, reposition, itself, either, in, the, northwest, area, of, gandh, ra, and, mathura, or, in, the, southeast, around, amaravati, stupa, some, artistic, activity, also, occurred, in, central, india, as, in, bh, rhut, to, which, the, shungas, may, or, may, not, have, contributed, the, greco, bactrian, king, demetrius, i, reigned, c, 200, 180, bce, invaded, the, indian, subcontinent, establishing, an, indo, greek, kingdom, that, was, to, last, in, parts, of, northwest, south, asia, until, the, end, of, the, 1st, century, ce, buddhism, flourished, under, the, indo, greek, and, greco, bactrian, kings, one, of, the, most, famous, indo, greek, kings, is, menander, reigned, c, 160, 135, bce, he, may, have, converted, to, buddhism, and, is, presented, in, the, mah, y, na, tradition, as, one, of, the, great, benefactors, of, the, faith, on, a, par, with, king, a, oka, or, the, later, kushan, king, kani, ka, menander, s, coins, bear, designs, of, the, eight, spoked, dharma, wheel, a, classic, buddhist, symbol, direct, cultural, exchange, is, also, suggested, by, a, dialogue, called, the, debate, of, king, milinda, milinda, pa, ha, which, recounts, a, discussion, between, menander, and, the, buddhist, monk, n, gasena, who, was, himself, a, student, of, the, greek, buddhist, monk, mahadharmaraksita, upon, menander, s, death, the, honor, of, sharing, his, remains, was, claimed, by, the, cities, under, his, rule, and, they, were, enshrined, in, stupas, in, a, parallel, with, the, historic, buddha, several, of, menander, s, indo, greek, successors, inscribed, follower, of, the, dharma, in, the, kharo, h, script, on, their, coins, during, the, first, century, bce, the, first, anthropomorphic, representations, of, the, buddha, are, found, in, the, lands, ruled, by, the, indo, greeks, in, a, realistic, style, known, as, greco, buddhist, many, of, the, stylistic, elements, in, the, representations, of, the, buddha, point, to, greek, influence, the, greco, roman, toga, like, wavy, robe, covering, both, shoulders, more, exactly, its, lighter, version, the, greek, himation, the, contrapposto, stance, of, the, upright,

great, teacher, preserver, of, the, dharma, was, a, greek, yona, buddhist, head, monk, according, to, the, mahavamsa, chap, xxix, who, led, 30, 000, buddhist, monks, from, the, greek, city, of, alasandra, alexandria, of, the, caucasus, around, 150, km, north, of, today, s, kabul, in, afghanistan, to, sri, lanka, for, the, dedication, of, the, great, stupa, in, anuradhapura, during, the, rule, 165, 135, bce, of, king, menander, i, dhammarakkhita, meaning, protected, by, the, dharma, was, one, of, the, missionaries, sent, by, the, mauryan, emperor, ashoka, to, proselytize, the, buddhist, faith, he, is, described, as, being, a, greek, pali, yona, lit, ionian, in, the, sri, lankan, mahavamsa, the, kushan, empire, 30, 375, ce, was, formed, by, the, invading, yuezhi, nomads, in, the, 1st, century, bce, it, eventually, encompassed, much, of, northern, india, pakistan, and, afghanistan, the, kushans, adopted, elements, of, the, hellenistic, culture, of, bactria, and, the, indo, greeks, during, kushan, rule, gandharan, buddhism, was, at, the, height, of, its, influence, and, a, significant, number, of, buddhist, centers, were, built, or, renovated, the, buddhist, art, of, kushan, gandhara, was, a, synthesis, of, greco, roman, iranian, and, indian, elements, the, gandh, ran, buddhist, texts, also, date, from, this, period, written, in, g, ndh, r, prakrit, they, are, the, oldest, buddhist, manuscripts, yet, discovered, c, 1st, century, ce, according, to, richard, salomon, most, of, them, belong, to, the, dharmaguptaka, school, emperor, kanishka, 128, 151, ce, is, particularly, known, for, his, support, of, buddhism, during, his, reign, stupas, and, monasteries, were, built, in, the, gandh, ran, city, of, peshawar, skt, purusapura, which, he, used, as, a, capital, kushan, royal, support, and, the, opening, of, trade, routes, allowed, gandharan, buddhism, to, spread, along, the, silk, road, to, central, asia, the, tarim, basin, and, thus, to, china, kanishka, is, also, said, to, have, convened, a, major, buddhist, council, for, the, sarvastivada, tradition, either, in, gandhara, or, kashmir, kanishka, gathered, 500, learned, monks, partly, to, compile, extensive, commentaries, on, the, abhidharma, although, it, is, possible, that, some, editorial, work, was, carried, out, upon, the, existing, sarvastivada, canon, itself, allegedly, during, the, council, there, were, altogether, three, hundred, thousand, verses, and, over, nine, million, statements, compiled, and, it, took, twelve, years, to, complete, the, main, fruit, of, this, council, was, the, compilation, of, the, vast, commentary, known, as, the, mah, vibh, sh, great, exegesis, an, extensive, compendium, and, reference, work, on, a, portion, of, the, sarv, stiv, din, abhidharma, modern, scholars, such, as, etienne, lamotte, and, david, snellgrove, have, questioned, the, veracity, of, this, traditional, account, scholars, believe, that, it, was, also, around, this, time, that, a, significant, change, was, made, in, the, language, of, the, sarv, stiv, din, canon, by, converting, an, earlier, prakrit, version, into, sanskrit, although, this, change, was, probably, effected, without, significant, loss, of, integrity, to, the, canon, this, event, was, of, particular, significance, since, sanskrit, was, the, sacred, language, of, brahmanism, in, india, and, was, also, being, used, by, other, thinkers, regardless, of, their, specific, religious, or, philosophical, allegiance, thus, enabling, a, far, wider, audience, to, gain, access, to, buddhist, ideas, and, practices, after, the, fall, of, the, kushans, small, kingdoms, ruled, the, gandharan, region, and, later, the, hephthalite, white, huns, conquered, the, area, circa, 440s, 670, under, the, hephthalites, gandharan, buddhism, continued, to, thrive, in, cities, like, balkh, bactria, as, remarked, by, xuanzang, who, visited, the, region, in, the, 7th, century, xuanzang, notes, that, there, were, over, a, hundred, buddhist, monasteries, in, the, city, including, the, nava, vihara, as, well, many, stupas, and, monks, after, the, end, of, the, hephthalite, empire, gandharan, buddhism,
