the, spanish, colonization, of, the, americas, began, in, 1493, on, the, caribbean, island, of, hispaniola, now, haiti, and, the, dominican, republic, after, the, initial, 1492, voyage, of, genoese, mariner, christopher, columbus, under, license, from, queen, isabella, i, of, castile, these, overseas, territories, of, the, spanish, empire, were, under, the, jurisdiction, of, crown, of, castile, until, the, last, territory, was, lost, in, 1898, spaniards, saw, the, dense, populations, of, indigenous, peoples, as, an, important, economic, resource, and, the, territory, claimed, as, potentially, producing, great, wealth, for, individual, spaniards, and, the, crown, religion, played, an, important, role, in, the, spanish, conquest, and, incorporation, of, indigenous, peoples, bringing, them, into, the, catholic, church, peacefully, or, by, force, the, crown, created, civil, and, religious, structures, to, administer, the, vast, territory, spanish, men, and, women, settled, in, greatest, numbers, where, there, were, dense, indigenous, populations, and, the, existence, of, valuable, resources, for, extraction, the, spanish, empire, claimed, jurisdiction, over, the, new, world, in, the, caribbean, and, north, and, south, america, with, the, exception, of, brazil, ceded, to, portugal, by, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, other, european, powers, including, england, france, and, the, dutch, republic, took, possession, of, territories, initially, claimed, by, spain, although, the, overseas, territories, under, the, jurisdiction, of, the, spanish, crown, are, now, commonly, called, colonies, the, term, was, not, used, until, the, second, half, of, 18th, century, the, process, of, spanish, settlement, now, called, colonization, is, and, the, colonial, era, are, terms, contested, by, scholars, of, latin, america, and, more, generally, it, is, estimated, that, during, the, period, 1492, 1832, a, total, of, 1, 86, million, spaniards, settled, in, the, americas, and, a, further, 3, 5, million, immigrated, during, the, post, independence, era, 1850, 1950, the, estimate, is, 250, 000, in, the, 16th, century, and, most, during, the, 18th, century, as, immigration, was, encouraged, by, the, new, bourbon, dynasty, the, indigenous, population, plummeted, by, an, estimated, 80, in, the, first, century, and, a, half, following, columbus, s, voyages, primarily, through, the, spread, of, infectious, diseases, practices, of, forced, labor, and, slavery, for, resource, extraction, and, forced, resettlement, in, new, villages, and, later, missions, were, implemented, alarmed, by, the, precipitous, fall, in, indigenous, populations, and, reports, of, settlers, exploitation, of, their, labor, the, crown, put, in, place, laws, to, protect, their, newly, converted, indigenous, vassals, europeans, imported, enslaved, africans, to, the, early, caribbean, settlements, to, replace, indigenous, labor, and, enslaved, and, free, africans, were, part, of, colonial, era, populations, a, mixed, race, casta, population, came, into, being, during, the, period, of, spanish, rule, in, the, early, 19th, century, the, spanish, american, wars, of, independence, resulted, in, the, secession, of, most, of, spanish, america, and, the, establishment, of, independent, nations, continuing, under, crown, rule, were, cuba, and, puerto, rico, along, with, the, philippines, which, were, all, lost, to, the, united, states, in, 1898, following, the, spanish, american, war, ending, its, rule, in, the, americas, the, expansion, of, spain, s, territory, took, place, under, the, catholic, monarchs, isabella, i, of, castile, and, her, husband, ferdinand, ii, of, aragon, whose, marriage, marked, the, beginning, of, spanish, power, beyond, the, iberian, peninsula, they, pursued, a, policy, of, joint, rule, of, their, kingdoms, and, created, the, initial, stage, of, a, single, spanish, monarchy, completed, under, the, eighteenth, century, bourbon, monarchs, the, first, expansion, of, territory, was, the, conquest, of, the, muslim, emirate, of, granada, on, 1, january, 1492, the, culmination, of, the, christian, reconquest, of, the, iberian, peninsula, held, by, the, muslims, since, 711, on, 31, march, 1492, the, catholic, monarch, ordered, the, expulsion, of, the, jews, in, spain, who, refused, to, convert, to, christianity, on, 12, october, 1492, genoese, mariner, christopher, columbus, made, landfall, in, the, western, hemisphere, and, in, 1493, permanent, spanish, settlement, of, the, americas, began, castile, and, aragon, were, ruled, jointly, by, their, respective, monarchs, but, they, remained, separate, kingdoms, when, the, catholic, monarchs, gave, official, approval, for, the, plans, for, columbus, s, voyage, to, reach, the, indies, by, sailing, west, the, funding, came, from, the, queen, of, castile, the, profits, from, spanish, expedition, flowed, to, castile, the, kingdom, of, portugal, authorized, a, series, of, voyages, down, the, coast, of, africa, and, when, they, rounded, the, southern, tip, were, able, to, sail, to, india, and, further, east, spain, sought, similar, wealth, and, authorized, columbus, s, voyage, sailing, west, once, the, spanish, settlement, in, the, caribbean, occurred, spain, and, portugal, formalized, a, division, of, the, world, between, them, in, the, 1494, treaty, of, tordesillas, the, deeply, pious, isabella, saw, the, expansion, of, spain, s, sovereignty, inextricably, paired, with, the, evangelization, of, non, christian, peoples, the, so, called, spiritual, conquest, with, the, military, conquest, pope, alexander, vi, in, a, 4, may, 1493, papal, decree, inter, caetera, divided, rights, to, lands, in, the, western, hemisphere, between, spain, and, portugal, on, the, proviso, that, they, spread, christianity, these, formal, arrangements, between, spain, and, portugal, and, the, pope, were, ignored, by, other, european, powers, with, the, french, the, english, and, the, dutch, seizing, territory, in, the, caribbean, and, in, north, america, claimed, by, spain, but, not, effectively, settled, portugal, s, claim, to, part, of, south, america, under, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, resulted, in, the, creation, of, portuguese, colony, of, brazil, although, during, the, rule, of, charles, v, the, spanish, empire, was, the, first, to, be, called, the, empire, on, which, the, sun, never, sets, under, philip, ii, the, permanent, colonization, of, the, philippine, islands, made, it, demonstrably, true, the, spanish, expansion, has, sometimes, been, succinctly, summed, up, as, being, motivated, by, gold, glory, god, that, is, the, search, for, material, wealth, the, enhancement, of, the, conquerors, and, the, crown, s, position, and, the, expansion, of, christianity, to, the, exclusion, of, other, religious, traditions, in, the, extension, of, spanish, sovereignty, to, its, overseas, territories, authority, for, expeditions, entradas, of, discovery, conquest, and, settlement, resided, in, the, monarchy, expeditions, required, authorization, by, the, crown, which, laid, out, the, terms, of, such, expedition, virtually, all, expeditions, after, the, columbus, voyages, which, were, funded, by, the, crown, of, castile, were, done, at, the, expense, of, the, leader, of, the, expedition, and, its, participants, although, often, the, participants, conquistadors, are, now, termed, soldiers, they, were, not, paid, soldiers, in, ranks, of, an, army, but, rather, soldiers, of, fortune, who, joined, an, expedition, with, the, expectation, of, profiting, from, it, the, leader, of, an, expedition, the, adelantado, was, a, senior, with, material, wealth, and, standing, who, could, persuade, the, crown, to, issue, him, a, license, for, an, expedition, he, also, had, to, attract, participants, to, the, expedition, who, staked, their, own, lives, and, meager, fortunes, on, the, expectation, of, the, expedition, s, success, the, leader, of, the, expedition, pledged, the, larger, share, of, capital, to, the, enterprise, which, in, many, ways, functioned, as, a, commercial, firm, upon, the, success, of, the, expedition, the, spoils, of, war, were, divvied, up, in, proportion, to, the, amount, a, participant, initially, staked, with, the, leader, receiving, the, largest, share, participants, supplied, their, own, armor, and, weapons, and, those, who, had, a, horse, received, two, shares, one, for, himself, the, second, recognizing, the, value, of, the, horse, as, a, machine, of, war, for, the, conquest, era, the, names, of, two, spaniards, are, popularly, known, because, they, led, the, conquests, of, two, indigenous, empires, hern, n, cort, s, leader, of, the, expedition, involved, in, the, conquest, of, the, aztec, empire, and, francisco, pizarro, leader, of, the, conquest, of, the, inca, in, peru, spanish, conquerors, took, advantage, of, indigenous, rivalries, to, forge, alliances, with, groups, seeing, an, advantage, for, their, own, goals, this, is, most, clearly, seen, in, the, conquest, of, the, aztec, empire, with, the, alliance, of, the, nahua, city, state, of, tlaxcala, against, the, aztec, empire, resulting, in, lasting, benefits, to, themselves, and, their, descendants, patterns, of, the, first, spanish, settlements, in, the, caribbean, were, to, endure, there, and, had, a, lasting, impact, on, the, spanish, empire, until, his, dying, day, columbus, was, convinced, that, he, had, reached, asia, the, indies, from, that, misperception, the, spanish, called, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, indians, indios, lumping, a, multiplicity, of, civilizations, groups, and, individuals, into, a, single, category, the, spanish, royal, government, called, its, overseas, possessions, the, indies, until, its, empire, dissolved, in, the, nineteenth, century, in, the, caribbean, because, there, was, no, integrated, indigenous, civilization, such, as, found, in, mexico, and, peru, there, was, no, large, scale, spanish, conquest, of, indigenous, peoples, but, there, was, indigenous, resistance, to, spanish, colonization, columbus, made, four, voyages, to, the, west, indies, as, the, monarchs, granted, columbus, vast, powers, of, governance, over, this, unknown, part, of, the, world, the, crown, of, castile, financed, more, of, his, trans, atlantic, journeys, a, pattern, they, would, not, repeat, elsewhere, effective, spanish, settlement, began, in, 1493, when, columbus, brought, livestock, seeds, agricultural, equipment, the, first, settlement, of, la, navidad, a, crude, fort, built, on, his, first, voyage, in, 1492, had, been, abandoned, by, the, time, he, returned, in, 1493, he, then, founded, the, settlement, of, la, isabela, on, the, island, they, named, hispaniola, now, divided, into, haiti, and, the, dominican, republic, spanish, explorations, of, other, islands, in, the, caribbean, and, what, turned, out, to, be, the, mainland, of, south, and, central, america, occupied, them, for, over, two, decades, columbus, had, promised, the, crown, that, the, region, he, now, controlled, held, a, huge, treasure, in, the, form, of, gold, and, spices, spanish, settlers, initially, found, relatively, dense, populations, of, indigenous, peoples, who, were, agriculturalists, living, in, villages, ruled, by, leaders, not, part, of, a, larger, integrated, political, system, the, spanish, saw, these, populations, as, a, source, of, labor, there, for, their, exploitation, to, supply, their, own, settlements, with, foodstuffs, but, more, importantly, for, the, spanish, to, extract, mineral, wealth, or, produce, another, valuable, commodity, for, spanish, enrichment, the, labor, of, dense, populations, of, ta, nos, were, allocated, as, grants, to, spanish, settlers, in, an, institution, known, as, the, encomienda, where, particular, indigenous, settlements, were, awarded, to, individual, spaniards, there, was, surface, gold, found, in, early, islands, and, holders, of, encomiendas, put, the, indigenous, to, work, panning, for, it, for, all, practical, purposes, this, was, slavery, queen, isabel, put, an, end, to, formal, slavery, declaring, the, indigenous, to, be, vassals, of, the, crown, but, spaniards, exploitation, of, indigenous, labor, continued, the, ta, no, population, on, hispaniola, went, from, hundreds, of, thousands, or, millions, the, estimates, by, scholars, vary, widely, but, in, the, mid, 1490s, they, were, practically, wiped, out, disease, and, overwork, disruption, of, family, life, and, the, agricultural, cycle, which, caused, severe, food, shortages, to, spaniards, dependent, on, them, rapidly, decimated, the, indigenous, population, from, the, spanish, viewpoint, their, source, of, labor, and, viability, of, their, own, settlements, was, at, risk, after, the, collapse, of, the, taino, population, of, hispaniola, spaniards, began, raiding, indigenous, settlements, on, nearby, islands, including, cuba, puerto, rico, and, jamaica, to, enslave, those, populations, replicating, the, demographic, catastrophe, there, as, well, the, names, of, two, indigenous, leaders, caciques, who, rebelled, against, spanish, colonization, enriquillo, and, hatuey, in, the, dominican, republic, hispaniola, have, become, important, dominican, friar, antonio, de, montesinos, denounced, spanish, cruelty, and, abuse, in, a, sermon, in, 1511, which, comes, down, to, us, in, the, writings, of, dominican, friar, bartolom, de, las, casas, in, 1542, dominican, friar, bartolom, de, las, casas, wrote, a, damning, account, of, this, demographic, catastrophe, a, short, account, of, the, destruction, of, the, indies, it, was, translated, quickly, to, english, and, became, the, basis, for, the, anti, spanish, writings, collectively, known, as, the, black, legend, las, casas, spent, his, long, life, attempting, to, defend, the, indigenous, populations, and, to, enlist, the, spanish, crown, in, establishing, protections, for, them, seen, most, prominently, in, the, enactment, of, the, new, laws, of, 1542, restricting, spaniards, inheritance, of, encomiendas, the, first, mainland, explorations, by, spaniards, were, followed, by, a, phase, of, inland, expeditions, and, conquest, in, 1500, the, city, of, nueva, c, diz, was, founded, on, the, island, of, cubagua, venezuela, followed, by, the, founding, of, santa, cruz, by, alonso, de, ojeda, in, the, present, day, guajira, peninsula, cuman, in, venezuela, was, the, first, permanent, settlement, founded, by, europeans, in, the, mainland, americas, in, 1501, by, franciscan, friars, but, due, to, successful, attacks, by, the, indigenous, people, it, had, to, be, refounded, several, times, until, diego, hern, ndez, de, serpa, s, foundation, in, 1569, the, spanish, founded, san, sebasti, n, de, uraba, in, 1509, but, abandoned, it, within, the, year, there, is, indirect, evidence, that, the, first, permanent, spanish, mainland, settlement, established, in, the, americas, was, santa, mar, a, la, antigua, del, dari, n, spaniards, spent, over, 25, years, in, the, caribbean, where, their, initial, high, hopes, of, dazzling, wealth, gave, way, to, continuing, exploitation, of, disappearing, indigenous, populations, exhaustion, of, local, gold, mines, initiation, of, cane, sugar, cultivation, as, an, export, product, and, forced, migration, of, enslaved, africans, as, a, labor, force, spaniards, continued, to, expand, their, presence, in, the, circum, caribbean, region, with, expeditions, one, was, by, francisco, hern, ndez, de, c, rdoba, in, 1517, another, by, juan, de, grijalva, in, 1518, which, brought, promising, news, of, possibilities, there, even, by, the, mid, 1510s, the, western, caribbean, was, largely, unexplored, by, spaniards, a, well, connected, settler, in, cuba, hern, n, cort, s, received, authorization, in, 1519, by, the, governor, of, cuba, to, form, an, expedition, of, exploration, only, to, this, far, western, region, that, expedition, was, to, make, world, history, the, caribbean, islands, became, less, central, to, spain, s, overseas, colonization, but, remained, important, strategically, and, economically, especially, the, islands, of, cuba, and, hispaniola, smaller, islands, claimed, by, spain, were, lost, to, the, english, and, the, dutch, with, france, taking, half, of, hispaniola, and, establishing, the, sugar, producing, colony, of, st, domingue, as, well, as, also, taking, other, islands, with, spanish, expansion, into, central, mexico, under, conqueror, hern, n, cort, s, and, the, conquest, of, the, aztec, empire, 1519, 1521, spanish, explorers, were, able, to, find, wealth, on, the, scale, that, they, had, long, hoped, for, unlike, spanish, contact, with, indigenous, populations, in, the, caribbean, which, involved, limited, armed, combat, and, sometimes, the, participation, of, indigenous, allies, the, conquest, of, central, mexico, was, protracted, and, necessitated, significant, numbers, of, indigenous, allies, who, chose, to, participate, in, defeating, the, aztec, empire, for, their, own, purposes, the, conquest, of, the, aztec, empire, involved, the, combined, effort, of, armies, from, many, indigenous, allies, spearheaded, by, a, small, spanish, force, of, conquistadors, the, aztecs, did, not, govern, over, an, empire, in, the, conventional, sense, but, were, the, rulers, of, a, confederation, of, dozens, of, city, states, and, other, polities, the, status, of, each, varied, from, harshly, subjugated, to, closely, allied, the, spaniards, persuaded, the, leaders, of, aztec, vassals, and, tlaxcala, a, city, state, never, conquered, by, the, aztecs, to, ally, with, them, against, the, aztecs, through, such, methods, the, spaniards, came, to, accumulate, a, massive, force, of, thousands, perhaps, tens, of, thousands, of, indigenous, warriors, records, of, the, conquest, of, central, mexico, include, accounts, by, the, expedition, leader, hern, n, cort, s, bernal, d, az, del, castillo, and, other, spanish, conquistadors, indigenous, allies, from, the, city, states, altepetl, of, tlaxcala, texcoco, and, huexotzinco, in, addition, indigenous, accounts, were, written, by, the, defeated, from, the, aztec, capital, tenochtitlan, a, case, of, history, being, written, by, those, other, than, the, victors, the, capture, of, the, aztec, emperor, moctezuma, ii, by, cort, s, was, not, a, brilliant, stroke, of, innovation, but, came, from, the, playbook, that, the, spanish, developed, during, their, period, in, the, caribbean, the, composition, of, the, expedition, was, the, standard, pattern, with, a, senior, leader, and, participating, men, investing, in, the, enterprise, with, the, full, expectation, of, rewards, if, they, did, not, lose, their, lives, cort, s, s, seeking, indigenous, allies, was, a, typical, tactic, of, warfare, divide, and, conquer, but, the, indigenous, allies, had, much, to, gain, by, throwing, off, aztec, rule, for, the, spaniards, tlaxcalan, allies, their, crucial, support, gained, them, enduring, political, legacy, into, the, modern, era, the, mexican, state, of, tlaxcala, the, conquest, of, central, mexico, sparked, further, spanish, conquests, following, the, pattern, of, conquered, and, consolidated, regions, being, the, launching, point, for, further, expeditions, these, were, often, led, by, secondary, leaders, such, as, pedro, de, alvarado, later, conquests, in, mexico, were, protracted, campaigns, with, less, immediate, results, than, the, conquest, of, the, aztec, empire, the, spanish, conquest, of, yucat, n, the, spanish, conquest, of, guatemala, the, conquest, of, the, pur, pecha, of, michoacan, the, war, of, mexico, s, west, and, the, chichimeca, war, in, northern, mexico, expanded, spanish, control, over, territory, and, indigenous, populations, stretching, thousands, of, miles, not, until, the, conquest, of, the, incan, empire, which, used, similar, tactics, and, began, in, 1532, was, the, conquest, of, the, aztecs, matched, in, scale, of, either, territory, or, treasure, in, 1532, at, the, battle, of, cajamarca, a, group, of, spaniards, under, francisco, pizarro, and, their, indigenous, andean, indian, auxiliaries, native, allies, ambushed, and, captured, the, emperor, atahualpa, of, the, inca, empire, it, was, the, first, step, in, a, long, campaign, that, took, decades, of, fighting, to, subdue, the, mightiest, empire, in, the, americas, in, the, following, years, spain, extended, its, rule, over, the, empire, of, the, inca, civilization, the, spanish, took, advantage, of, a, recent, civil, war, between, the, factions, of, the, two, brothers, emperor, atahualpa, and, hu, scar, and, the, enmity, of, indigenous, nations, the, incas, had, subjugated, such, as, the, huanca, chachapoyas, and, ca, aris, in, the, following, years, the, conquistadors, and, indigenous, allies, extended, control, over, greater, andes, region, the, viceroyalty, of, per, was, established, in, 1542, the, last, inca, stronghold, was, conquered, by, the, spanish, in, 1572, peru, was, the, last, territory, on, the, continent, under, spanish, rule, which, ended, on, 9, december, 1824, at, the, battle, of, ayacucho, spanish, rule, continued, until, 1898, in, cuba, and, puerto, rico, has, four, months, of, winter, no, more, and, in, them, except, when, there, is, a, quarter, moon, when, it, rains, one, or, two, days, all, the, other, days, have, such, a, beautiful, sunshine, chile, was, explored, by, spaniards, based, in, peru, where, spaniards, found, the, fertile, soil, and, mild, climate, attractive, the, mapuche, people, of, chile, whom, the, spaniards, called, araucanians, resisted, fiercely, the, spanish, did, establish, the, settlement, of, chile, in, 1541, founded, by, pedro, de, valdivia, southward, colonization, by, the, spanish, in, chile, halted, after, the, conquest, of, chilo, archipelago, in, 1567, this, is, thought, to, have, been, the, result, of, an, increasingly, harsh, climate, to, the, south, and, the, lack, of, a, populous, and, sedentary, indigenous, population, to, settle, among, for, the, spanish, in, the, fjords, and, channels, of, patagonia, south, of, the, b, o, b, o, river, the, mapuche, successfully, reversed, colonization, with, the, destruction, of, the, seven, cities, in, 1599, 1604, this, mapuche, victory, laid, the, foundation, for, the, establishment, of, a, spanish, mapuche, frontier, called, la, frontera, within, this, frontier, the, city, of, concepci, n, assumed, the, role, of, military, capital, of, spanish, ruled, chile, with, a, hostile, indigenous, population, no, obvious, mineral, or, other, exploitable, resources, and, little, strategic, value, chile, was, a, fringe, area, of, colonial, spanish, america, hemmed, in, geographically, by, the, andes, to, the, east, pacific, ocean, to, the, west, and, indigenous, to, the, south, between, 1537, and, 1543, six, spanish, expeditions, entered, highland, colombia, conquered, the, muisca, confederation, and, set, up, the, new, kingdom, of, granada, spanish, nuevo, reino, de, granada, gonzalo, jim, nez, de, quesada, was, the, leading, conquistador, with, his, brother, hern, n, second, in, command, it, was, governed, by, the, president, of, the, audiencia, of, bogot, and, comprised, an, area, corresponding, mainly, to, modern, day, colombia, and, parts, of, venezuela, the, conquistadors, originally, organized, it, as, a, captaincy, general, within, the, viceroyalty, of, peru, the, crown, established, the, audiencia, in, 1549, ultimately, the, kingdom, became, part, of, the, viceroyalty, of, new, granada, first, in, 1717, and, permanently, in, 1739, after, several, attempts, to, set, up, independent, states, in, the, 1810s, the, kingdom, and, the, viceroyalty, ceased, to, exist, altogether, in, 1819, with, the, establishment, of, gran, colombia, venezuela, was, first, visited, by, europeans, during, the, 1490s, when, columbus, was, in, control, of, the, region, and, the, region, as, a, source, for, indigenous, slaves, for, spaniards, in, cuba, and, hispaniola, since, the, spanish, destruction, of, the, local, indigenous, population, there, were, few, permanent, settlements, but, spaniards, settled, the, coastal, islands, of, cubagua, and, margarita, to, exploit, the, pearl, beds, western, venezuela, s, history, took, an, atypical, direction, in, 1528, when, spain, s, first, hapsburg, monarch, charles, i, granted, rights, to, colonize, to, the, german, banking, family, of, the, welsers, charles, sought, to, be, elected, holy, roman, emperor, and, was, willing, to, pay, whatever, it, took, to, achieve, that, he, became, deeply, indebted, to, the, german, welser, and, fugger, banking, families, to, satisfy, his, debts, to, the, welsers, he, granted, them, the, right, to, colonize, and, exploit, western, venezuela, with, the, proviso, that, they, found, two, towns, with, 300, settlers, each, and, construct, fortifications, they, established, the, colony, of, klein, venedig, in, 1528, they, founded, the, towns, of, coro, and, maracaibo, they, were, aggressive, in, making, their, investment, pay, alienating, the, indigenous, populations, and, spaniards, alike, charles, revoked, the, grant, in, 1545, ending, the, episode, of, german, colonization, argentina, was, not, conquered, or, later, exploited, in, the, grand, fashion, of, central, mexico, or, peru, since, the, indigenous, population, was, sparse, and, there, were, no, precious, metals, or, other, valuable, resources, although, today, buenos, aires, at, the, mouth, of, r, o, de, la, plata, is, a, major, metropolis, it, held, no, interest, for, spaniards, and, the, 1535, 36, settlement, failed, and, was, abandoned, by, 1541,

permanent, settlement, was, established, in, 1580, by, juan, de, garay, who, arrived, by, sailing, down, the, paran, river, from, asunci, n, now, the, capital, of, paraguay, exploration, from, peru, resulted, in, the, foundation, of, tucum, n, in, what, is, now, northwest, argentina, much, of, what, is, now, the, southern, united, states, was, claimed, by, spain, some, of, it, at, least, explored, by, the, spanish, starting, in, the, early, 1500s, and, some, permanent, settlements, established, spanish, explorers, claimed, land, for, the, crown, in, the, modern, day, states, of,

florida, in, 1513, for, political, reasons, spain, would, sometimes, claim, that, la, florida, was, all, of, the, north, american, continent, however, the, name, was, typically, used, to, refer, to, the, peninsula, itself, as, well, as, the, gulf, coast, georgia, carolina, and, southern, virginia, in, 1521, ponce, de, leon, was, killed, while, trying, to, establish, a, settlement, near, what, is, now, charlotte, harbor, florida, another, failed, attempt, was, conducted, by, lucas, v, zquez, de, ayll, n, who, set, out, with, approximately, 500, colonists, and, established, the, settlement, of,

in, what, is, now, pensacola, florida, this, settlement, predates, the, foundation, of, st, augustine, by, six, years, marking, an, important, yet, often, overlooked, moment, in, the, history, of, spanish, colonization, archaeological, evidence, from, the, university, of, west, florida, has, confirmed, the, presence, of, luna, s, expedition, which, included, 1, 500, people, and, lasted, from, 1559, to, 1561, the, artifacts, discovered, at, the, site, provide, a, direct, link, to, spain, s, early, efforts, to, colonize, the, northern, gulf, coast, in, the, fall, of, 1528, spanish, explorer,

modern, times, permanent, spanish, settlements, were, founded, in, new, mexico, starting, in, 1598, with, santa, fe, founded, in, 1610, the, spectacular, conquests, of, central, mexico, 1519, 1521, and, peru, 1532, sparked, spaniards, hopes, of, finding, yet, another, high, civilization, expeditions, continued, into, the, 1540s, and, regional, capitals, founded, by, the, 1550s, among, the, most, notable, expeditions, are, hernando, de, soto, into, southeast, north, america, leaving, from, cuba, 1539, 1542, francisco, v, zquez, de, coronado, to, northern, mexico, 1540, 1542, and, gonzalo,

for, el, dorado, far, more, famous, now, is, lope, de, aguirre, who, led, a, mutiny, against, urs, a, who, was, murdered, aguirre, subsequently, wrote, a, letter, to, philip, ii, bitterly, complaining, about, the, treatment, of, conquerors, like, himself, in, the, wake, of, the, assertion, of, crown, control, over, peru, an, earlier, expedition, that, left, in, 1527, was, led, by, p, nfilo, nav, ez, who, was, killed, early, on, survivors, continued, to, travel, among, indigenous, groups, in, the, north, american, south, and, southwest, until, 1536, lvar, n, ez, cabeza, de, vaca, was, one, of, four, survivors, of, that, expedition, writing, an, account, of, it, the, crown, later, sent, him, to, asunci, n, paraguay, to, be, adelantado, there, expeditions, continued, to, explore, territories, in, hopes, of, finding, another, aztec, or, inca, empire, with, no, further, success, francisco, de, ibarra, led, an, expedition, from, zacatecas, in, northern, new, spain, and, founded, durango, juan, de, o, ate, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, last, conquistador, expanded, spanish, sovereignty, over, what, is, now, new, mexico, like, previous, conquistadors, o, ate, engaged, in, widespread, abuses, of, the, indian, population, shortly, after, founding, santa, fe, o, ate, was, recalled, to, mexico, city, by, the, spanish, authorities, he, was, subsequently, tried, and, convicted, of, cruelty, to, both, natives, and, colonists, and, banished, from, new, mexico, for, life, two, major, factors, affected, the, density, of, spanish, settlement, in, the, long, term, one, was, the, presence, or, absence, of, dense, hierarchically, organized, indigenous, populations, that, could, be, made, to, work, the, other, was, the, presence, or, absence, of, an, exploitable, resource, for, the, enrichment, of, settlers, best, was, gold, but, silver, was, found, in, abundance, the, two, main, areas, of, spanish, settlement, after, 1550, were, mexico, and, peru, the, sites, of, the, aztec, and, inca, indigenous, civilizations, and, rich, deposits, of, the, valuable, metal, silver, spanish, settlement, in, mexico, largely, replicated, the, organization, of, the, area, in, preconquest, times, however, in, peru, the, center, of, the, incas, was, too, far, south, too, remote, and, at, too, high, an, altitude, for, the, spanish, capital, so, the, capital, lima, was, built, near, the, pacific, coast, the, capitals, of, both, mexico, and, peru, mexico, city, and, lima, came, to, have, large, concentrations, of, spanish, settlers, and, hubs, of, royal, and, ecclesiastical, administration, large, commercial, enterprises, with, skilled, artisans, and, centers, of, culture, although, spaniards, had, hoped, to, find, vast, quantities, of, gold, the, discovery, of, large, quantities, of, silver, became, the, motor, of, the, spanish, colonial, economy, a, major, source, of, income, for, the, spanish, crown, and, transformed, the, international, economy, mining, regions, in, mexico, were, remote, outside, the, zone, of, indigenous, settlement, in, central, and, southern, mexico, mesoamerica, but, mines, in, zacatecas, founded, 1548, and, guanajuato, founded, 1548, emerged, as, key, hubs, in, the, colonial, economy, in, peru, silver, was, found, in, a, single, silver, mountain, the, cerro, rico, de, potos, which, is, still, producing, silver, in, the, 21st, century, potos, founded, 1545, was, in, the, zone, of, dense, indigenous, settlement, so, that, labor, could, be, mobilized, on, traditional, patterns, to, extract, the, ore, an, important, element, for, productive, mining, was, mercury, for, processing, high, grade, ore, peru, had, a, source, in, huancavelica, founded, 1572, while, mexico, had, to, rely, on, mercury, imported, from, spain, the, spanish, founded, towns, in, the, caribbean, on, hispaniola, and, cuba, on, a, pattern, that, became, spatially, similar, throughout, spanish, america, a, central, plaza, had, the, most, important, buildings, on, the, four, sides, especially, buildings, for, royal, officials, and, the, main, church, a, checkerboard, pattern, radiated, outward, residences, of, the, officials, and, elites, were, closest, to, the, main, square, once, on, the, mainland, where, there, were, dense, indigenous, populations, in, urban, settlements, the, spanish, could, build, a, spanish, settlement, on, the, same, site, dating, its, foundation, to, when, that, occurred, often, they, erected, a, church, on, the, site, of, an, indigenous, temple, they, replicated, the, existing, indigenous, network, of, settlements, but, added, a, port, city, the, spanish, network, needed, a, port, city, so, that, inland, settlements, could, be, connected, by, sea, to, spain, in, mexico, hern, n, cort, s, and, the, men, of, his, expedition, founded, of, the, port, town, of, veracruz, in, 1519, and, constituted, themselves, as, the, town, councilors, as, a, means, to, throw, off, the, authority, of, the, governor, of, cuba, who, did, not, authorize, an, expedition, of, conquest, once, the, aztec, empire, was, toppled, they, founded, mexico, city, on, the, ruins, of, the, aztec, capital, their, central, official, and, ceremonial, area, was, built, on, top, of, aztec, palaces, and, temples, in, peru, spaniards, founded, the, city, of, lima, as, their, capital, and, its, nearby, port, of, callao, rather, than, the, high, altitude, site, of, cuzco, the, center, of, inca, rule, spaniards, established, a, network, of, settlements, in, areas, they, conquered, and, controlled, important, ones, include, santiago, de, guatemala, 1524, puebla, 1531, quer, taro, ca, 1531, guadalajara, 1531, 42, valladolid, now, morelia, 1529, 41, antequera, now, oaxaca, 1525, 29, campeche, 1541, and, m, rida, in, southern, central, and, south, america, settlements, were, founded, in, panama, 1519, le, n, nicaragua, 1524, cartagena, 1532, piura, 1532, quito, 1534, trujillo, 1535, cali, 1537, bogot,

1580, asunci, n, 1537, potos, 1545, la, paz, bolivia, 1548, and, tucum, n, 1553, the, columbian, exchange, was, as, significant, as, the, clash, of, civilizations, arguably, the, most, significant, introduction, was, diseases, brought, to, the, americas, which, devastated, indigenous, populations, in, a, series, of, epidemics, the, loss, of, indigenous, population, had, a, direct, impact, on, spaniards, as, well, since, increasingly, they, saw, those, populations, as, a, source, of, their, own, wealth, disappearing, before, their, eyes, in, the, first, settlements, in, the, caribbean, the, spaniards, deliberately, brought, animals, and, plants, that, transformed, the, ecological, landscape, pigs, cattle, sheep, goats, and, chickens, allowed, spaniards, to, eat, a, diet, with, which, they, were, familiar, but, the, importation, of, horses, transformed, warfare, for, both, the, spaniards, and, the, indigenous, where, the, spaniards, had, exclusive, access, to, horses, in, warfare, they, had, an, advantage, over, indigenous, warriors, on, foot, they, were, initially, a, scarce, commodity, but, horse, breeding, became, an, active, industry, horses, that, escaped, spanish, control, were, captured, by, indigenous, many, indigenous, also, raided, for, horses, mounted, indigenous, warriors, were, significant, foes, for, spaniards, the, chichimeca, in, northern, mexico, the, comanche, in, the, northern, great, plains, and, the, mapuche, in, southern, chile, and, the, pampas, of, argentina, resisted, spanish, conquest, for, spaniards, the, fierce, chichimecas, barred, them, for, exploiting, mining, resources, in, northern, mexico, spaniards, waged, a, fifty, year, war, ca, 1550, 1600, to, subdue, them, but, peace, was, only, achieved, by, spaniards, making, significant, donations, of, food, and, other, commodities, the, chichimeca, demanded, peace, by, purchase, ended, the, conflict, in, southern, chile, and, the, pampas, the, araucanians, mapuche, prevented, further, spanish, expansion, the, image, of, mounted, araucanians, capturing, and, carrying, off, white, women, was, the, embodiment, of, spanish, ideas, of, civilization, and, barbarism, cattle, multiplied, quickly, in, areas, where, little, else, could, turn, a, profit, for, spaniards, including, northern, mexico, and, the, argentine, pampas, the, introduction, of, sheep, production, was, an, ecological, disaster, in, places, where, they, were, raised, in, great, numbers, since, they, ate, vegetation, to, the, ground, preventing, the, regeneration, of, plants, the, spanish, brought, new, crops, for, cultivation, see, mission, garden, for, specific, foods, they, preferred, wheat, cultivation, to, indigenous, sources, of, carbohydrates, casava, maize, corn, and, potatoes, initially, importing, seeds, from, europe, and, planting, in, areas, where, plow, agriculture, could, be, utilized, such, as, the, mexican, baj, o, they, also, imported, cane, sugar, which, was, a, high, value, crop, in, early, spanish, america, spaniards, also, imported, citrus, trees, establishing, orchards, of, oranges, lemons, limes, and, grapefruit, other, imports, were, figs, apricots, cherries, pears, and, peaches, among, others, the, exchange, did, not, go, one, way, important, indigenous, crops, that, transformed, europe, were, the, potato, and, maize, which, produced, abundant, crops, that, led, to, the, expansion, of, populations, in, europe, chocolate, and, vanilla, were, cultivated, in, mexico, and, exported, to, europe, among, the, foodstuffs, that, became, staples, in, european, cuisine, and, could, be, grown, there, were, tomatoes, squashes, bell, peppers, cashews, pecans, and, peanuts, the, empire, in, the, indies, was, a, newly, established, dependency, of, the,

politics, of, asserting, royal, authority, to, oppose, columbus, resulted, in, the, suppression, of, his, privileges, and, the, creation, of, territorial, governance, under, royal, authority, these, governorates, also, called, as, provinces, were, the, basic, of, the, territorial, government, of, the, indies, and, arose, as, the, territories, were, conquered, and, colonized, to, carry, out, the,

protection, of, the, indigenous, populations, from, enslavement, and, exploitation, by, spanish, settlers, were, established, in, the, laws, of, burgos, 1512, 1513, the, laws, were, the, first, codified, set, of, laws, governing, the, behavior, of, spanish, settlers, in, the, americas, particularly, with, regards, to, treatment, of, native, indians, in, the, institution, of, the, encomienda, they, forbade, the, maltreatment, of, natives, and, endorsed, the, forced, resettlement, of, indigenous, populations, with, attempts, of, conversion, to, catholicism, upon, their, failure, to, effectively, protect, the, indigenous, and, following, the, spanish, conquest, of, the, aztec, empire, and, the, spanish, conquest, of, peru, more, stringent, laws, to, control, conquerors, and, settlers, exercise, of, power, especially, their, maltreatment, of, the, indigenous, populations, were, promulgated, known, as, the, new, laws, 1542, the, crown, aimed, to, prevent, the, formation, of, an, aristocracy, in, the, indies, not, under, crown, control, queen, isabel, was, the, first, monarch, that, laid, the, first, stone, for, the, protection, of, the, indigenous, peoples, in, her, testament, in, which, the, catholic, monarch, prohibited, the, enslavement, of, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, then, the, first, such, in, 1542, the, legal, thought, behind, them, was, the, basis, of, modern, international, law, the, valladolid, debate, 1550, 1551, was, the, first, moral, debate, in, european, history, to, discuss, the, rights, and, treatment, of, a, colonized, people, by, colonizers, held, in, the, colegio, de, san, gregorio, in, the, spanish, city, of, valladolid, it, was, a, moral, and, theological, debate, about, the, colonization, of, the, americas, its, justification, for, the, conversion, to, catholicism, and, more, specifically, about, the, relations, between, the, european, settlers, and, the, natives, of, the, new, world, it, consisted, of, a, number, of, opposing, views, about, the, way, natives, were, to, be, integrated, into, colonial, life, their, conversion, to, christianity, and, their, rights, and, obligations, according, to, the, french, historian, jean, dumont, the, valladolid, debate, was, a, major, turning, point, in, world, history, in, that, moment, in, spain, appeared, the, dawn, of, the, human, rights, the, indigenous, populations, in, the, caribbean, became, the, focus, of, the, crown, in, its, roles, as, sovereigns, of, the, empire, and, patron, of, the, catholic, church, spanish, conquerors, holding, grants, of, indigenous, labor, in, encomienda, ruthlessly, exploited, them, a, number, of, friars, in, the, early, period, came, to, the, vigorous, defense, of, the, indigenous, populations, who, were, new, converts, to, christianity, prominent, dominican, friars, in, santo, domingo, especially, antonio, de, montesinos, and, bartolom, de, las, casas, denounced, the, maltreatment, and, pressed, the, crown, to, act, to, protect, the, indigenous, populations, the, crown, enacted, laws, of, burgos, 1513, and, the, requerimiento, to, curb, the, power, of, the, spanish, conquerors, and, give, indigenous, populations, the, opportunity, to, peacefully, embrace, spanish, authority, and, christianity, neither, was, effective, in, its, purpose, las, casas, was, officially, appointed, protector, of, the, indians, and, spent, his, life, arguing, forcefully, on, their, behalf, the, new, laws, of, 1542, were, the, result, limiting, the, power, of, encomenderos, the, private, holders, of, grants, to, indigenous, labor, previously, held, in, perpetuity, the, crown, was, open, to, limiting, the, inheritance, of, encomiendas, in, perpetuity, as, a, way, to, extinguish, the, coalescence, of, a, group, of, spaniards, impinging, on, royal, power, in, peru, the, attempt, of, the, newly, appointed, viceroy, blasco, n, ez, vela, to, implement, the, new, laws, so, soon, after, the, conquest, sparked, a, revolt, by, conquerors, against, the, viceroy, and, the, viceroy, was, killed, in, 1546, in, mexico, don, mart, n, cort, s, the, son, and, legal, heir, of, conqueror, hern, n, cort, s, and, other, heirs, of, encomiendas, led, a, failed, revolt, against, the, crown, don, mart, n, was, sent, into, exile, while, other, conspirators, were, executed, the, conquest, of, the, aztec, and, inca, empires, ended, their, sovereignty, over, their, respective, territorial, expanses, replaced, by, the, spanish, empire, and, indigenous, religious, beliefs, and, practices, were, suppressed, and, populations, converted, to, christianity, the, spanish, empire, could, not, have, ruled, these, vast, territories, and, dense, indigenous, populations, without, utilizing, the, existing, indigenous, political, and, economic, structures, at, the, local, level, a, key, to, this, was, the, cooperation, between, most, indigenous, elites, with, the, new, ruling, structure, the, spanish, recognized, indigenous, elites, as, nobles, and, gave, them, continuing, standing, in, their, communities, indigenous, elites, could, use, the, noble, titles, don, and, do, a, were, exempt, from, the, head, tax, and, could, entail, their, landholdings, into, cacicazgos, these, elites, played, an, intermediary, role, between, the, spanish, rulers, and, indigenous, commoners, since, in, mesoamerica, and, the, andean, civilizations, indigenous, peoples, had, existing, traditions, of, payment, of, tribute, and, required, labor, service, the, spanish, could, tap, into, these, systems, to, extract, wealth, there, were, few, spaniards, and, huge, indigenous, populations, so, utilizing, indigenous, intermediaries, was, a, practical, solution, to, the, incorporation, of, the, indigenous, population, into, the, new, regime, of, rule, by, maintaining, hierarchical, divisions, within, communities, indigenous, noblemen, were, the, direct, interface, between, the, indigenous, and, spanish, spheres, and, kept, their, positions, so, long, as, they, continued, to, be, loyal, to, the, spanish, crown, the, exploitation, and, demographic, catastrophe, that, indigenous, peoples, experienced, from, spanish, rule, in, the, caribbean, also, occurred, as, spaniards, expanded, their, control, over, territories, and, their, indigenous, populations, the, crown, set, the, indigenous, communities, legally, apart, from, spaniards, as, well, as, blacks, who, made, up, the, rep, blica, de, espa, oles, with, the, creation, of, the, rep, blica, de, indios, the, crown, attempted, to, curb, spaniards, exploitation, banning, spaniards, bequeathing, their, private, grants, of, indigenous, communities, tribute, and, encomienda, labor, in, 1542, in, the, new, laws, in, mexico, the, crown, established, the, general, indian, court, juzgado, general, de, indios, which, heard, disputes, affecting, individual, indigenous, as, well, as, indigenous, communities, lawyers, for, these, cases, were, funded, by, a, half, real, tax, an, early, example, of, legal, aid, for, the, poor, a, similar, legal, apparatus, was, set, up, in, lima, the, spaniards, systematically, attempted, to, transform, structures, of, indigenous, governance, to, those, more, closely, resembling, those, of, spaniards, so, the, indigenous, city, state, became, a, spanish, town, and, the, indigenous, noblemen, who, ruled, became, officeholders, of, the, town, council, cabildo, although, the, structure, of, the, indigenous, cabildo, looked, similar, to, that, of, the, spanish, institution, its, indigenous, functionaries, continued, to, follow, indigenous, practices, in, central, mexico, there, exist, minutes, of, the, sixteenth, century, meetings, in, nahuatl, of, the, tlaxcala, cabildo, indigenous, noblemen, were, particularly, important, in, the, early, period, of, colonization, since, the, economy, of, the, encomienda, was, initially, built, on, the, extraction, of, tribute, and, labor, from, the, commoners, in, their, communities, as, the, colonial, economy, became, more, diversified, and, less, dependent, on, these, mechanisms, for, the, accumulation, of, wealth, the, indigenous, noblemen, became, less, important, for, the, economy, however, noblemen, became, defenders, of, the, rights, to, land, and, water, controlled, by, their, communities, in, colonial, mexico, there, are, petitions, to, the, king, about, a, variety, of, issues, important, to, particular, indigenous, communities, when, the, noblemen, did, not, get, a, favorable, response, from, the, local, friar, or, priest, or, local, royal, officials, works, by, historians, in, the, twentieth, and, twenty, first, centuries, have, expanded, the, understanding, of, the, impact, of, the, spanish, conquest, and, changes, during, the, more, than, three, hundred, years, of, spanish, rule, there, are, many, such, works, for, mexico, often, drawing, on, native, language, documentation, in, nahuatl, mixtec, and, yucatec, maya, for, the, andean, area, there, are, an, increasing, number, of, publications, as, well, the, history, of, the, guaran, has, also, been, the, subject, of, a, recent, study, in, 2000, pope, john, paul, ii, apologized, for, the, wrongs, done, by, the, catholic, church, including, those, to, indigenous, peoples, in, 2007, pope, benedict, xvi, issued, a, less, sweeping, apology, for, the, wrongs, done, in, the, conversion, of, indigenous, peoples, in, 1524, the, council, of, the, indies, was, established, following, the, system, of, system, of, councils, that, advised, the, monarch, and, made, decisions, on, his, behalf, about, specific, matters, of, government, based, in, castile, with, the, assignment, of, the, governance, of, the, indies, it, was, thus, responsible, for, drafting, legislation, proposing, the, appointments, to, the, king, for, civil, government, as, well, as, ecclesiastical, appointments, and, pronouncing, judicial, sentences, as, maximum, authority, in, the, overseas, territories, the, council, of, the, indies, took, over, both, the, institutions, in, the, indies, as, the, defense, of, the, interests, of, the, crown, the, catholic, church, and, of, indigenous, peoples, with, the, 1508, papal, grant, to, the, crown, of, the, patronato, real, the, crown, rather, than, the, pope, exercised, absolute, power, over, the, catholic, church, in, the, americas, and, the, philippines, a, privilege, the, crown, zealously, guarded, against, erosion, or, incursion, crown, approval, through, the, council, of, the, indies, was, needed, for, the, establishment, of, bishoprics, building, of, churches, appointment, of, all, clerics, in, 1721, at, the, beginning, of, the, bourbon, monarchy, the, crown, transferred, the, main, responsibility, for, governing, the, overseas, empire, from, the, council, of, the, indies, to, the, ministry, of, the, navy, and, the, indies, which, were, subsequently, divided, into, two, separate, ministries, in, 1754, the, impossibility, of, the, physical, presence, of, the, monarch, and, the, necessity, of, strong, royal, governance, in, the, indies, resulted, in, the, appointment, of, viceroys, vice, kings, the, direct, representation, of, the, monarch, in, both, civil, and, ecclesiastical, spheres, viceroyalties, were, the, largest, territory, unit, of, administration, in, the, civil, and, religious, spheres, and, the, boundaries, of, civil, and, ecclesiastical, governance, coincided, by, design, to, ensure, crown, control, over, both, bureaucracies, until, the, eighteenth, century, there, were, just, two, viceroyalties, with, the, viceroyalty, of, new, spain, founded, 1535, administering, north, america, a, portion, of, the, caribbean, and, the, philippines, and, the, viceroyalty, of, peru, founded, 1542, having, jurisdiction, over, spanish, south, america, viceroys, served, as, the, vice, patron, of, the, catholic, church, including, the, inquisition, established, in, the, seats, of, the, viceroyalties, mexico, city, and, lima, viceroys, were, responsible, for, good, governance, of, their, territories, economic, development, and, humane, treatment, of, the, indigenous, populations, in, the, eighteenth, century, reforms, the, viceroyalty, of, peru, was, reorganized, splitting, off, portions, to, form, the, viceroyalty, of, new, granada, colombia, 1739, and, the, viceroyalty, of, rio, de, la, plata, argentina, 1776, leaving, peru, with, jurisdiction, over, peru, charcas, and, chile, viceroys, were, of, high, social, standing, almost, without, exception, born, in, spain, and, served, fixed, terms, the, audiencias, were, initially, constituted, by, the, crown, as, a, key, administrative, institution, with, royal, authority, and, loyalty, to, the, crown, as, opposed, to, conquerors, and, first, settlers, although, constituted, as, the, highest, judicial, authority, in, their, territorial, jurisdiction, they, also, had, executive, and, legislative, authority, and, served, as, the, executive, on, an, interim, basis, judges, oidores, held, formidable, power, their, role, in, judicial, affairs, and, in, overseeing, the, implementation, of, royal, legislation, made, their, decisions, important, for, the, communities, they, served, since, their, appointments, were, for, life, or, the, pleasure, of, the, monarch, they, had, a, continuity, of, power, and, authority, that, viceroys, and, captains, general, lacked, because, of, their, shorter, term, appointments, they, were, the, center, of, the, administrative, system, gave, the, government, of, the, indies, a, strong, basis, of, permanence, and, continuity, their, main, function, was, judicial, as, a, court, of, justice, of, second, instance, court, of, appeal, in, penal, and, civil, matters, but, also, the, audiencias, were, courts, the, first, instance, in, the, city, where, it, had, its, headquarters, and, also, in, the, cases, involving, the, royal, treasury, besides, court, of, justice, the, audiencias, had, functions, of, government, as, counterweight, the, authority, of, the, viceroys, since, they, could, communicate, with, both, the, council, of, the, indies, and, the, king, without, the, requirement, of, requesting, authorization, from, the, viceroy, this, direct, correspondence, of, the, audiencia, with, the, council, of, the, indies, made, it, possible, for, the, council, to, give, the, audiencia, direction, on, general, aspects, of, government, audiencias, were, a, significant, base, of, power, and, influence, for, american, born, elites, starting, in, the, late, sixteenth, century, with, nearly, a, quarter, of, appointees, being, born, in, the, indies, by, 1687, during, a, financial, crisis, in, the, late, seventeenth, century, the, crown, began, selling, audiencia, appointments, and, american, born, spaniards, held, 45, of, audiencia, appointments, although, there, were, restrictions, of, appointees, ties, to, local, elite, society, and, participation, in, the, local, economy, they, acquired, dispensations, from, the, cash, strapped, crown, audiencia, judgments, and, other, functions, became, more, tied, to, the, locality, and, less, to, the, crown, and, impartial, justice, during, the, bourbon, reforms, in, the, mid, eighteenth, century, the, crown, systematically, sought, to, centralize, power, in, its, own, hands, and, diminish, that, of, its, overseas, possessions, appointing, peninsular, born, spaniards, to, audiencias, american, born, elite, men, complained, bitterly, about, the, change, since, they, lost, access, to, power, that, they, had, enjoyed, for, nearly, a, century, during, the, early, era, and, under, the, habsburgs, the, crown, established, a, regional, layer, of, colonial, jurisdiction, in, the, institution, of, corregimiento, which, was, between, the, audiencia, and, town, councils, corregimiento, expanded, royal, authority, from, the, urban, centers, into, the, countryside, and, over, the, indigenous, population, as, with, many, colonial, institutions, corregimiento, had, its, roots, in, castile, when, the, catholic, monarchs, centralize, power, over, municipalities, in, the, indies, corregimiento, initially, functioned, to, bring, control, over, spanish, settlers, who, exploited, the, indigenous, populations, held, in, encomienda, in, order, to, protect, the, shrinking, indigenous, populations, and, prevent, the, formation, of, an, aristocracy, of, conquerors, and, powerful, settlers, the, royal, official, in, charge, of, a, district, was, the, corregidor, who, was, appointed, by, the, viceroy, usually, for, a, five, year, term, corregidores, collected, the, tribute, from, indigenous, communities, and, regulated, forced, indigenous, labor, alcald, as, mayores, were, larger, districts, with, a, royal, appointee, the, alcalde, mayor, as, the, indigenous, populations, declined, the, need, for, corregimiento, decreased, and, then, suppressed, with, the, alcald, a, mayor, remaining, an, institution, until, it, was, replaced, in, the, eighteenth, century, bourbon, reforms, by, royal, officials, intendants, the, salary, of, officials, during, the, habsburg, era, were, paltry, but, the, corregidor, or, alcalde, mayor, in, densely, populated, areas, of, indigenous, settlement, with, a, valuable, product, could, use, his, office, for, personal, enrichment, as, with, many, other, royal, posts, these, positions, were, sold, starting, in, 1677, the, bourbon, era, intendants, were, appointed, and, relatively, well, paid, spanish, settlers, sought, to, live, in, towns, and, cities, with, governance, being, accomplished, through, the, town, council, or, cabildo, the, cabildo, was, composed, of, the, prominent, residents, vecinos, of, the, municipality, so, that, governance, was, restricted, to, a, male, elite, with, majority, of, the, population, exercising, power, cities, were, governed, on, the, same, pattern, as, in, spain, and, in, the, indies, the, city, was, the, framework, of, spanish, life, the, cities, were, spanish, and, the, countryside, indigenous, in, areas, of, previous, indigenous, empires, with, settled, populations, the, crown, also, melded, existing, indigenous, rule, into, a, spanish, pattern, with, the, establishment, of, cabildos, and, the, participation, of, indigenous, elites, as, officials, holding, spanish, titles, there, were, a, variable, number, of, councilors, regidores, depending, on, the, size, of, the, town, also, two, municipal, judges, alcaldes, menores, who, were, judges, of, first, instance, and, also, other, officials, as, police, chief, inspector, of, supplies, court, clerk, and, a, public, herald, they, were, in, charge, of, distributing, land, to, the, neighbors, establishing, local, taxes, dealing, with, the, public, order, inspecting, jails, and, hospitals, preserving, the, roads, and, public, works, such, as, irrigation, ditches, and, bridges, supervising, public, health, regulating, festive, activities, monitoring, market, prices, or, the, protection, of, indians, after, the, reign, of, philip, ii, the, municipal, offices, including, the, councilors, were, auctioned, to, alleviate, the, need, for, money, of, the, crown, even, the, offices, could, also, be, sold, which, became, hereditary, so, that, the, government, of, the, cities, went, on, to, hands, of, urban, oligarchies, in, order, to, control, the, municipal, life, the, crown, ordered, the, appointment, of, corregidores, and, alcaldes, mayores, to, exert, greater, political, control, and, judicial, functions, in, minor, districts, their, functions, were, governing, the, respective, municipalities, administering, of, justice, and, being, appellate, judges, in, the, alcaldes, menores, judgments, but, only, the, corregidor, could, preside, over, the, cabildo, however, both, charges, were, also, put, up, for, sale, freely, since, the, late, 16th, century, most, spanish, settlers, came, to, the, indies, as, permanent, residents, established, families, and, businesses, and, sought, advancement, in, the, colonial, system, such, as, membership, of, cabildos, so, that, they, were, in, the, hands, of, local, american, born, crillo, elites, during, the, bourbon, era, even, when, the, crown, systematically, appointed, peninsular, born, spaniards, to, royal, posts, rather, than, american, born, the, cabildos, remained, in, the, hands, of, local, elites, as, the, empire, expanded, into, areas, of, less, dense, indigenous, populations, the, crown, created, a, chain, of, presidios, military, forts, or, garrisons, that, provided, spanish, settlers, protection, from, indian, attacks, in, mexico, during, the, sixteenth, century, chichimec, war, guarded, the, transit, of, silver, from, the, mines, of, zacatecas, to, mexico, city, as, many, as, 60, salaried, soldiers, were, garrisoned, in, presidios, presidios, had, a, resident, commanders, who, set, up, commercial, enterprises, of, imported, merchandise, selling, it, to, soldiers, as, well, as, indian, allies, the, other, frontier, institution, was, the, religious, mission, to, convert, the, indigenous, populations, missions, were, established, with, royal, authority, through, the, patronato, real, the, jesuits, were, effective, missionaries, in, frontier, areas, until, their, expulsion, from, spain, and, its, empire, in, 1767, the, franciscans, took, over, some, former, jesuit, missions, and, continued, the, expansion, of, areas, incorporated, into, the, empire, although, their, primary, focus, was, on, religious, conversion, missionaries, served, as, diplomatic, agents, peace, emissaries, to, hostile, tribes, and, they, were, also, expected, to, hold, the, line, against, nomadic, nonmissionary, indians, as, well, as, other, european, powers, on, the, frontier, of, empire, indians, were, seen, as, sin, raz, n, without, reason, non, indian, populations, were, described, as, gente, de, raz, n, people, of, reason, who, could, be, mixed, race, castas, or, black, and, had, greater, social, mobility, in, frontier, regions, christian, evangelization, of, non, christian, peoples, was, a, key, factor, in, spaniards, justification, of, the, conquest, of, indigenous, peoples, in, what, was, called, the, spiritual, conquest, in, 2000, pope, john, paul, ii, apologized, for, errors, committed, by, the, catholic, church, including, forced, conversion, during, the, early, colonial, period, the, crown, authorized, friars, of, catholic, religious, orders, franciscans, dominicans, and, augustinians, to, function, as, priests, during, the, conversion, of, indigenous, populations, during, the, early, age, of, discovery, the, diocesan, clergy, in, spain, was, poorly, educated, and, considered, of, a, low, moral, standing, and, the, catholic, monarchs, were, reluctant, to, allow, them, to, spearhead, evangelization, each, order, set, up, networks, of, parishes, in, the, various, regions, provinces, sited, in, existing, indigenous, settlements, where, christian, churches, were, built, and, where, evangelization, of, the, indigenous, was, based, hern, n, cort, s, requested, franciscan, and, dominican, friars, be, sent, to, new, spain, immediately, after, the, conquest, of, tenochtitlan, to, begin, evangelization, the, franciscans, arrived, first, in, 1525, in, a, group, of, twelve, the, twelve, apostles, of, mexico, among, this, first, group, was, toribio, de, benavente, known, now, as, motolinia, the, nahuatl, word, for, poor, after, the, 1550s, the, crown, increasingly, favored, the, diocesan, clergy, over, the, religious, orders, the, diocesan, clergy, also, called, the, secular, clergy, were, under, the, direct, authority, of, bishops, who, were, appointed, by, the, crown, through, the, power, granted, by, the, pope, in, the, patronato, real, religious, orders, had, their, own, internal, regulations, and, leadership, the, crown, had, authority, to, draw, the, boundaries, for, dioceses, and, parishes, the, creation, of, the, ecclesiastical, hierarchy, of, the, diocesan, clergy, marked, a, turning, point, in, the, crown, s, control, over, the, religious, sphere, the, structure, of, the, hierarchy, was, in, many, ways, parallel, to, that, of, civil, governance, the, pope, was, the, head, of, the, catholic, church, but, the, granting, of, the, patronato, real, to, the, spanish, monarchy, gave, the, king, the, power, of, appointment, patronage, of, ecclesiastics, the, monarch, was, head, of, the, civil, and, religious, hierarchies, the, capital, city, of, a, viceroyalty, became, of, the, seat, of, the, archbishop, the, region, overseen, by, the, archbishop, was, divided, into, large, units, the, diocese, headed, by, a, bishop, the, diocese, was, in, turn, divided, into, smaller, units, the, parish, staffed, by, a, parish, priest, in, 1574, philip, ii, promulgated, the, order, of, patronage, ordenaza, del, patronato, ordering, the, religious, orders, to, turn, over, their, parishes, to, the, secular, clergy, a, policy, that, secular, clerics, had, long, sought, for, the, central, areas, of, empire, with, their, large, indigenous, populations, although, implementation, was, slow, and, incomplete, it, was, an, assertion, of, royal, power, over, the, clergy, and, the, quality, of, parish, priests, improved, since, the, ordenanza, mandated, competitive, examination, to, fill, vacant, positions, religious, orders, along, with, the, jesuits, then, embarked, on, further, evangelization, in, frontier, regions, of, the, empire, the, jesuits, resisted, crown, control, refusing, to, pay, the, tithe, on, their, estates, that, supported, the, ecclesiastical, hierarchy, and, came, into, conflict, with, bishops, the, most, prominent, example, is, in, puebla, mexico, when, bishop, juan, de, palafox, y, mendoza, was, driven, from, his, bishopric, by, the, jesuits, the, bishop, challenged, the, jesuits, continuing, to, hold, indian, parishes, and, function, as, priests, without, the, required, royal, licenses, his, fall, from, power, is, viewed, as, an, example, of, the, weakening, of, the, crown, in, the, mid, seventeenth, century, since, it, failed, to, protect, their, duly, appointed, bishop, the, crown, expelled, the, jesuits, from, spain, and, the, indies, in, 1767, during, the, bourbon, reforms, inquisitional, powers, were, initially, vested, in, bishops, who, could, root, out, idolatry, and, heresy, in, mexico, bishop, juan, de, zum, rraga, prosecuted, and, had, executed, in, 1539, a, nahua, lord, known, as, don, carlos, of, texcoco, for, apostasy, and, sedition, for, having, converted, to, christianity, and, then, renounced, his, conversion, and, urged, others, to, do, so, as, well, zum, rraga, was, reprimanded, for, his, actions, as, exceeding, his, authority, when, the, formal, institution, of, the, inquisition, was, established, in, 1571, indigenous, peoples, were, excluded, from, its, jurisdiction, on, the, grounds, that, they, were, neophytes, new, converts, and, not, capable, of, understanding, religious, doctrine, it, has, been, estimated, that, over, 1, 86, million, spaniards, emigrated, to, latin, america, in, the, period, between, 1492, and, 1824, with, millions, more, continuing, to, immigrate, following, independence, native, populations, declined, significantly, during, the, period, of, spanish, expansion, in, hispaniola, the, indigenous, ta, no, pre, contact, population, before, the, arrival, of, columbus, of, several, hundred, thousand, had, declined, to, sixty, thousand, by, 1509, the, population, of, the, native, american, population, in, mexico, declined, by, an, estimated, 90, reduced, to, 1, 2, 5, million, people, by, the, early, 17th, century, in, peru, the, indigenous, amerindian, pre, contact, population, of, around, 6, 5, million, declined, to, 1, million, by, the, early, 17th, century, the, overwhelming, cause, of, the, decline, in, both, mexico, and, peru, was, infectious, diseases, such, as, smallpox, and, measles, although, the, brutality, of, the, encomienda, also, played, a, significant, part, in, the, population, decline, of, the, history, of, the, indigenous, population, of, california, sherburne, f, cook, 1896, 1974, was, the, most, painstakingly, careful, researcher, from, decades, of, research, he, made, estimates, for, the, pre, contact, population, and, the, history, of, demographic, decline, during, the, spanish, and, post, spanish, periods, according, to, cook, the, indigenous, californian, population, at, first, contact, in, 1769, was, about, 310, 000, and, had, dropped, to, 25, 000, by, 1910, the, vast, majority, of, the, decline, happened, after, the, spanish, period, during, the, mexican, and, us, periods, of, californian, history, 1821, 1910, with, the, most, dramatic, collapse, 200, 000, to, 25, 000, occurring, in, the, us, period, 1846, 1910, the, largest, population, in, spanish, america, was, and, remained, indigenous, what, spaniards, called, indians, indios, a, category, that, did, not, exist, before, the, arrival, of, the, europeans, the, spanish, crown, separated, them, into, the, rep, blica, de, indios, europeans, immigrated, from, various, provinces, of, spain, with, initial, waves, of, emigration, consisting, of, more, men, than, women, they, were, referred, to, as, espa, oles, and, espa, olas, and, later, being, differentiated, by, the, terms, indicating, place, of, birth, peninsular, for, those, born, in, spain, criollo, criolla, or, americano, ameriana, for, those, born, in, the, americas, enslaved, africans, were, imported, to, spanish, territories, primarily, to, cuba, as, was, the, case, in, peninsular, spain, africans, negros, were, able, buy, their, freedom, horro, so, that, in, most, of, the, empire, free, blacks, and, mulatto, black, spanish, populations, outnumbered, slave, populations, spaniards, and, indigenous, parents, produced, mestizo, offspring, who, were, also, part, of, the, rep, blica, de, espa, oles, in, areas, of, dense, stratified, indigenous, populations, especially, mesoamerica, and, the, andean, region, spanish, conquerors, awarded, perpetual, private, grants, of, labor, and, tribute, to, particular, indigenous, settlements, in, encomienda, they, were, in, a, privileged, position, to, accumulate, private, wealth, spaniards, had, some, knowledge, of, the, existing, indigenous, practices, of, labor, and, tribute, so, that, learning, in, more, detail, what, tribute, particular, regions, delivered, to, the, aztec, empire, prompted, the, creation, of, codex, mendoza, a, codification, for, spanish, use, the, rural, regions, remained, highly, indigenous, with, little, interface, between, the, large, numbers, of, indigenous, and, the, small, numbers, of, the, rep, blica, de, espa, oles, which, included, blacks, and, mixed, race, castas, tribute, goods, in, mexico, were, most, usually, lengths, of, cotton, cloth, woven, by, women, and, maize, and, other, foodstuffs, produced, by, men, these, could, be, sold, in, markets, and, thereby, converted, to, cash, in, the, early, period, for, spaniards, formal, ownership, of, land, was, less, important, than, control, of, indigenous, labor, and, receiving, tribute, spaniards, had, seen, the, disappearance, of, the, indigenous, populations, in, the, caribbean, and, with, that, the, disappearance, of, their, main, source, of, wealth, propelling, spaniards, to, expand, their, regions, of, control, with, the, conquests, of, the, aztec, and, inca, empires, large, numbers, of, spaniards, emigrated, from, the, iberian, peninsula, to, seek, their, fortune, or, to, pursue, better, economic, conditions, for, themselves, the, establishment, of, large, permanent, spanish, settlements, attracted, a, whole, range, of, new, residents, who, set, up, shop, as, carpenters, bakers, tailors, and,
