servant, seventy, two, indian, delegates, met, in, bombay, in, 1885, and, founded, the, indian, national, congress, they, were, mostly, members, of, the, upwardly, mobile, and, successful, western, educated, provincial, elites, engaged, in, professions, such, as, law, teaching, and, journalism, at, its, inception, congress, had, no, well, defined, ideology, and, commanded, few, of, the, resources, essential, to, a, political, organisation, instead, it, functioned, more, as, a, debating, society, that, met, annually, to, express, its, loyalty, to, the, british, and, passed, numerous, resolutions, on, less, controversial, issues, such, as, civil, rights, or, opportunities, in, government, especially, in, the, civil, service, these, resolutions, were, submitted, to, the, indian, government, and, occasionally, to, the, british, parliament, but, the, congress, s, early, gains, were, slight, despite, its, claim, to, represent, all, india, the, congress, voiced, the, interests, of, urban, elites, the, number, of, participants, from, other, social, and, economic, backgrounds, remained, negligible, however, this, period, of, history, is, still, crucial, because, it, represented, the, first, political, mobilisation, of, indians, coming, from, all, parts, of, the, subcontinent, and, the, first, articulation, of, the, idea, of, india, as, one, nation, rather, than, a, collection, of, independent, princely, states, religious, groups, played, a, role, in, reforming, indian, society, these, were, of, several, religions, from, hindu, groups, such, as, the, arya, samaj, the, brahmo, samaj, to, other, religions, such, as, the, namdhari, or, kuka, sect, of, sikhism, the, work, of, men, like, swami, vivekananda, ramakrishna, sri, aurobindo, v, o, chidambaram, pillai, subramanya, bharathy, bankim, chandra, chatterjee, rabindranath, tagore, and, dadabhai, naoroji, as, well, as, women, such, as, the, scots, irish, sister, nivedita, spread, the, passion, for, rejuvenation, and, freedom, the, rediscovery, of, india, s, indigenous, history, by, several, european, and, indian, scholars, also, fed, into, the, rise, of, nationalism, among, indians, the, triumvirate, also, is, known, as, lal, bal, pal, bal, gangadhar, tilak, bipin, chandra, pal, lala, lajpat, rai, along, with, v, o, chidambaram, pillai, sri, aurobindo, surendranath, banerjee, and, rabindranath, tagore, were, some, of, the, prominent, leaders, of, movements, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, swadeshi, movement, was, the, most, successful, the, name, of, lokmanya, began, spreading, around, and, people, started, following, him, in, all, parts, of, the, country, the, indian, textile, industry, also, played, an, important, role, in, the, freedom, struggle, of, india, the, merchandise, of, the, textile, industry, pioneered, the, industrial, revolution, in, india, and, soon, england, was, producing, cotton, cloth, in, such, great, quantities, that, the, domestic, market, was, saturated, and, the, products, had, to, be, sold, in, foreign, markets, on, the, other, hand, india, was, rich, in, cotton, production, and, was, in, a, position, to, supply, british, mills, with, the, raw, material, they, required, this, was, the, time, when, india, was, under, british, rule, and, the, east, india, company, had, already, established, its, roots, in, india, raw, materials, were, exported, to, england, at, very, low, rates, while, cotton, cloth, of, refined, quality, was, imported, to, india, and, sold, at, very, high, prices, this, was, draining, india, s, economy, causing, the, textile, industry, of, india, to, suffer, greatly, this, led, to, great, resentment, among, cotton, cultivators, and, traders, after, lord, curzon, announced, the, partition, of, bengal, in, 1905, there, was, massive, opposition, from, the, people, of, bengal, initially, the, partition, plan, was, opposed, through, press, campaign, the, total, follower, of, such, techniques, led, to, the, boycott, of, british, goods, and, the, people, of, india, pledged, to, use, only, swadeshi, or, indian, goods, and, to, wear, only, indian, cloth, imported, garments, were, viewed, with, hate, at, many, places, public, burnings, of, foreign, cloth, were, organised, shops, selling, foreign, cloths, were, closed, the, cotton, textile, industry, is, rightly, described, as,

of, achieving, the, proposed, measures, were, later, enshrined, in, the, government, of, india, act, 1919, which, introduced, the, principle, of, a, dual, mode, of, administration, or, diarchy, in, which, both, elected, indian, legislators, and, appointed, british, officials, shared, power, the, act, also, expanded, the, central, and, provincial, legislatures, and, widened, the, franchise,

government, health, education, and, public, works, were, handed, over, to, indians, while, more, sensitive, matters, such, as, finance, taxation, and, maintaining, law, and, order, were, retained, by, the, provincial, british, administrators, gandhi, had, been, a, leader, of, the, indian, nationalist, movement, in, south, africa, he, had, also, been, a, vocal, opponent, of, basic, discrimination, and, abusive, labour, treatment, as, well, as, suppressive, police, control, such, as, the, rowlatt, acts, during, these, protests, gandhi, had, perfected, the, concept, of, satyagraha, in, january, 1914, well, before, the, first, world, war, began, gandhi, was, successful, the, legislation, against, indians, was, repealed, and, all, indian, political, prisoners, were, released, by, general, jan,

india, on, 9, january, 1915, and, initially, entered, the, political, fray, not, with, calls, for, a, nation, state, but, in, support, of, the, unified, commerce, oriented, territory, that, the, congress, party, had, been, asking, for, gandhi, believed, that, the, industrial, development, and, educational, development, that, the, europeans, had, brought, were, long, required, to, alleviate, many, of, india, s, chronic, problems, gopal, krishna, gokhale, a, veteran, congressman, and, indian, leader, became, gandhi, s, mentor, gandhi, s, ideas, and, strategies, of, non, violent, civil, disobedience, initially, appeared, impractical, to, some, indians, and, their, congress, leaders, in, the, mahatma, s, own, words, civil, disobedience, is, civil, breach, of, immoral, statutory, enactments, it, had, to, be, carried, out, non, violently, by, withdrawing, co, operation, with, the, corrupt, state, gandhi, had, great, respect, for, lokmanya, tilak, his, programmes, were, all, inspired, by, tilak, s, chatusutri, programme, the, positive, impact, of, reform, was, seriously, undermined, in, 1919, by, the, rowlatt, act, named, after, the, recommendations, made, the, previous, year, to, the, imperial, legislative, council, by, the, rowlatt, committee, the, commission, was, set, up, to, look, into, the, war, time, conspiracies, by, the, nationalist, organisations, and,

and, arresting, any, individuals, suspected, of, sedition, or, treason, without, a, warrant, it, was, increasingly, reviled, within, india, due, to, widespread, and, indiscriminate, use, many, popular, leaders, including, annie, besant, and, ali, brothers, had, been, detained, the, rowlatt, act, was, therefore, passed, in, the, face, of, universal, opposition, among, the, non, official, indian, members, in, the, viceroy, s, council, the, extension, of, the, act, drew, widespread, critical, opposition, a, nationwide, cessation, of, work, hartal, was, called, marking, the, beginning, of, widespread, although, not, nationwide, popular, discontent, the, agitation, unleashed, by, the, acts, led, to, demonstrations, and, british, repressions, culminating, on, 13, april, 1919, in, the, jallianwala, bagh, massacre, also, known, as, the, amritsar, massacre, in, amritsar, punjab, in, response, to, agitation, in, amritsar, brigadier, general, reginald, dyer, blocked, the, main, and, only, entrance, and, ordered, troops, under, his, command, to, fire, into, an, unarmed, and, unsuspecting, crowd, of, some, 15, 000, men, women, and, children, they, had, assembled, peacefully, at, jallianwala, bagh, a, walled, courtyard, but, dyer, had, wanted, to, execute, the, imposed, ban, on, all, meetings, and, proposed, to, teach, all, protestors, a, lesson, the, harsher, way, a, total, of, 1, 651, rounds, were, fired, killing, 379, people, as, according, to, an, official, british, commission, indian, officials, estimates, ranged, as, high, as, 1, 499, and, wounding, 1, 137, in, the, massacre, dyer, was, forced, to, retire, but, was, hailed, as, a, hero, by, some, in, britain, demonstrating, to, indian, nationalists, that, the, empire, was, beholden, to, public, opinion, in, britain, but, not, in, india, the, episode, dissolved, wartime, hopes, of, home, rule, and, goodwill, and, opened, a, rift, that, could, not, be, bridged, short, of, complete, self, rule, from, 1920, to, 1922, gandhi, started, the, non, cooperation, movement, at, the, kolkata, session, of, the, congress, in, september, 1920, gandhi, convinced, other, leaders, of, the, need, to, start, a, non, co, operation, movement, in, support, of, khilafat, as, well, as, for, dominion, status, the, first, satyagraha, movement, urged, the, use, of, khadi, and, indian, material, as, alternatives, to, those, shipped, from, britain, it, also, urged, people, to, boycott, british, educational, institutions, and, law, courts, resign, from, government, employment, refuse, to, pay, taxes, and, forsake, british, titles, and, honors, although, this, came, too, late, to, influence, the, framing, of, the, new, government, of, india, act, 1919, the, movement, enjoyed, widespread, popular, support, and, the, resulting, unparalleled, magnitude, of, disorder, presented, a, serious, challenge, to, foreign, rule, however, gandhi, called, off, the, movement, because, he, was, scared, after, the, chauri, chaura, incident, which, saw, the, death, of, twenty, two, policemen, at, the, hands, of, an, angry, mob, that, india, would, descend, into, anarchy, in, 1920, under, gandhi, s, leadership, the, congress, was, reorganized, and, given, a, new, constitution, whose, goal, was, swaraj, membership, in, the, party, was, opened, to, anyone, prepared, to, pay, a, token, fee, and, a, hierarchy, of, committees, was, established, and, made, responsible, for, discipline, and, control, over, a, hitherto, amorphous, and, diffuse, movement, the, party, was, transformed, from, an, elite, organisation, to, one, of, mass, national, appeal, gandhi, was, sentenced, in, 1922, to, six, years, in, prison, but, was, released, after, serving, two, on, his, release, from, prison, he, set, up, the, sabarmati, ashram, in, ahmedabad, on, the, banks, of, the, river, sabarmati, he, established, the, newspaper, young, india, introducing, a, series, of, reforms, aimed, at, the, socially, disadvantaged, within, hindu, society, the, rural, poor, and, the, untouchables, this, era, saw, the, emergence, of, a, new, generation, of, indians, from, within, the, congress, party, including, maulana, azad, c, rajagopalachari, jawaharlal, nehru, vallabhbhai, patel, subhas, chandra, bose, and, others, who, would, later, on, come, to, form, the, most, prominent, voices, of, the, indian, self, rule, movement, whether, keeping, with, gandhian, values, or, as, in, the, case, of, bose, s, indian, national, army, diverging, from, it, the, indian, political, spectrum, was, further, broadened, in, the, mid, 1920s, by, the, emergence, of, both, moderate, and, militant, parties, such, as, the, swaraj, party, hindu, mahasabha, communist, party, of, india, and, the, rashtriya, swayamsevak, sangh, regional, political, organisations, also, continued, to, represent, the, interests, of, non, brahmins, in, madras, mahars, in, maharashtra, and, sikhs, in, punjab, however, people, like, mahakavi, subramanya, bharathi, vanchinathan, and, neelakanda, brahmachari, played, a, major, role, from, tamil, nadu, in, both, self, rule, struggle, and, fighting, for, equality, for, all, castes, and, communities, many, women, participated, in, the, movement, including, kasturba, gandhi, gandhi, s, wife, rajkumari, amrit, kaur, muthulaxmi, reddy, aruna, asaf, ali, and, many, others, the, mass, movements, sparked, nationalist, sentiment, with, the, indian, populace, and, figures, like, mahatma, gandhi, united, a, nation, behind, his, non, violence, movement, philosophy, and, undoubtedly, put, crucial, pressure, on, the, british, occupation, the, movements, failed, in, their, primary, objective, achieving, independence, for, india, as, they, were, often, called, off, before, they, naturally, concluded, due, to, laws, and, punishment, while, in, the, later, years, of, the, raj, economic, factors, like, the, reversing, trade, fortunes, between, britain, and, india, and, the, cost, of, fielding, the, indian, armed, forces, abroad, lumped, on, the, british, taxpayer, by, the, 1935, government, of, india, act, had, mounting, implications, for, british, administration, united, resistance, further, drew, light, on, the, growing, disparity, of, the, british, failures, to, achieve, solidarity, over, india, on, 14, july, 1942, the, congress, working, committee, executive, committee, of, indian, national, congress, whose, president, abul, kalam, azad, supported, gandhi, passed, a, resolution, demanding, complete, independence, from, the, british, government, and, proposed, massive, civil, disobedience, if, the, british, did, not, accede, to, the, demands, on, 8, august, 1942, the, quit, india, movement, bharat, chhodo, andolan, began, a, civil, disobedience, movement, in, india, in, response, to, mahatma, gandhi, s, call, for, immediate, self, rule, by, indians, and, against, sending, indians, to, world, war, ii, other, major, parties, rejected, the, quit, india, plan, and, most, cooperated, closely, with, the, british, as, did, the, princely, states, the, civil, service, and, the, police, the, muslim, league, supported, the, raj, and, grew, rapidly, in, membership, and, in, influence, with, the, british, the, british, swiftly, responded, to, the, quit, india, movement, with, mass, arrests, over, 100, 000, arrests, were, made, massive, fines, were, levied, and, demonstrators, were, subjected, to, public, flogging, hundreds, of, civilians, were, killed, in, violence, many, shot, by, the, police, army, tens, of, thousands, of, leaders, were, also, arrested, and, imprisoned, until, 1945, ultimately, the, british, government, realised, that, india, was, ungovernable, in, the, long, run, and, the, question, for, the, postwar, era, became, how, to, exit, gracefully, and, peacefully, congress, leader, and, famous, poet, hasrat, mohani, and, communist, party, of, india, leader, swami, kumaranand, had, demanded, complete, independence, purna, swaraj, from, the, british, in, 1921, and, put, the, resolution, during, an, all, india, congress, forum, at, the, ahmedabad, session, of, aicc, maghfoor, ahmad, ajazi, supported, the, purna, swaraj, motion, demanded, by, hasrat, mohani, in, 1928, india, league, was, established, by, v, k, krishna, menon, in, london, to, demand, total, independence, from, the, british, rule, this, organisation, has, been, described, as, the, principal, organisation, promoting, indian, nationalism, in, pre, war, britain, following, the, rejection, of, the, simon, commission, s, rejections, an, all, party, conference, was, held, at, mumbai, in, may, 1928, to, instill, a, sense, of, camaraderie, the, conference, appointed, a, committee, under, motilal, nehru, to, create, a, constitution, for, india, the, kolkata, session, of, the, indian, national, congress, asked, the, british, government, to, accord, india, dominion, status, by, december, 1929, or, face, a, countrywide, civil, disobedience, movement, amid, rising, discontent, and, increasingly, violent, regional, movements, a, call, for, complete, sovereignty, and, an, end, to, british, rule, found, greater, support, from, the, people, at, the, lahore, session, in, december, 1929, the, indian, national, congress, adopted, the, aim, of, complete, self, rule, it, authorised, the, working, committee, to, launch, a, civil, disobedience, movement, throughout, the, country, it, was, decided, that, 26, january, 1930, should, be, observed, all, over, india, as, the, purna, swaraj, complete, self, rule, day, the, gandhi, irwin, pact, was, signed, in, march, 1931, and, the, government, agreed, to, release, political, prisoners, mahatma, gandhi, managed, to, have, over, 90, 000, political, prisoners, released, under, this, pact, though, his, appeal, to, terminate, the, death, sentences, of, bhagat, singh, sukhdev, thapar, and, shivaram, rajguru, was, not, accepted, by, the, british, for, the, next, few, years, congress, and, the, government, negotiated, until, the, government, of, india, act, 1935, emerged, the, muslim, league, disputed, the, claim, of, the, congress, to, represent, all, people, of, india, while, the, congress, disputed, the, muslim, league, s, claim, to, voice, the, aspirations, of, all, muslims, the, civil, disobedience, movement, launched, a, new, chapter, in, the, indian, independence, movement, it, did, not, succeed, by, itself, but, it, brought, the, indian, population, together, under, the, indian, national, congress, s, leadership, the, movement, resulted, in, self, rule, being, a, talking, point, once, again, and, recruited, more, indians, to, the, idea, the, movement, allowed, the, indian, independence, community, to, revive, their, inner, confidence, and, strength, against, the, british, government, in, addition, the, movement, weakened, the, authority, of, the, british, and, aided, in, the, end, of, the, british, empire, in, india, overall, the, civil, disobedience, movement, was, an, essential, achievement, in, the, history, of, indian, self, rule, because, it, persuaded, new, delhi, of, the, role, of, the, masses, in, self, determination, the, government, of, india, act, 1935, the, voluminous, and, final, constitutional, effort, at, governing, british, india, articulated, three, major, goals, establishing, a, loose, federal, structure, achieving, provincial, autonomy, and, safeguarding, minority, interests, through, separate, electorates, the, federal, provisions, intended, to, unite, princely, states, and, british, india, at, the, centre, were, not, implemented, because, of, ambiguities, in, safeguarding, the, existing, privileges, of, princes, in, february, 1937, however, provincial, autonomy, became, a, reality, when, elections, were, held, the, congress, emerged, as, the, dominant, party, with, a, clear, majority, in, five, provinces, and, held, an, upper, hand, in, two, while, the, muslim, league, performed, poorly, in, 1939, the, viceroy, linlithgow, declared, india, s, entrance, into, the, second, world, war, without, consulting, provincial, governments, in, protest, the, congress, asked, all, of, its, elected, representatives, to, resign, from, the, government, muhammad, ali, jinnah, the, president, of, the, all, india, muslim, league, persuaded, participants, at, the, annual, muslim, league, session, at, lahore, in, 1940, to, adopt, what, later, came, to, be, known, as, the, lahore, resolution, demanding, the, division, of, india, into, two, separate, sovereign, states, one, muslim, the, other, hindu, sometimes, referred, to, as, two, nation, theory, although, the, idea, of, pakistan, had, been, introduced, as, early, as, 1930, very, few, had, responded, to, it, in, opposition, to, the, lahore, resolution, the, all, india, azad, muslim, conference, gathered, in, delhi, in, april, 1940, to, voice, its, support, for, a, united, india, its, members, included, several, islamic, organisations, in, india, as, well, as, 1400, nationalist, muslim, delegates, the, attendance, at, the, nationalist, meeting, was, about, five, times, than, the, attendance, at, the, league, meeting, the, all, india, muslim, league, worked, to, try, to, silence, those, muslims, who, stood, against, the, partition, of, india, often, using, intimidation, and, coercion, the, murder, of, the, all, india, azad, muslim, conference, leader, allah, bakhsh, soomro, also, made, it, easier, for, the, all, india, muslim, league, to, demand, the, creation, of, pakistan, there, is, no, real, connection, between, these, two, unrests, labour, and, congress, opposition, but, their, very, existence, and, coexistence, explains, and, fully, justifies, the, attention, which, lord, irwin, gave, to, the, labour, problems, apart, from, a, few, stray, incidents, armed, rebellions, against, the, british, rulers, did, not, occur, before, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, the, indian, revolutionary,

the, axis, powers, to, fight, britain, the, quit, india, movement, also, known, as, bharat, chhodo, andolan, was, a, civil, disobedience, movement, in, india, which, commenced, on, 8, august, 1942, in, response, to, gandhi, s, call, for, immediate, self, rule, by, indians, and, against, sending, indians, to, world, war, ii, he, asked, all, teachers, to, leave, their, schools, and, other, indians, to, leave, their, respective, jobs, and, take, part, in, this, movement, due, to, gandhi, s, political, influence, his, request, was, followed, by, a, significant, proportion, of, the, population, in, addition, congress, led, the, quit, india, movement, to, demand, the, british, to, leave, india, and, transfer, the, political, power, to, a, representative, government, during, the, movement, gandhi, and, his, followers, continued, to, use, non, violence, against, british, rule, this, movement, was, where, gandhi, gave, his, famous, message, do, or, die, and, this, message, spread, towards, the, indian, community, in, addition, this, movement, was, addressed, directly, to, women, as, disciplined, soldiers, of, indian, freedom, and, they, had, to, keep, the, war, for, independence, to, go, on, against, british, rule, at, the, outbreak, of, war, the, congress, party, had, during, the, wardha, meeting, of, the, working, committee, in, september, 1939, passed, a, resolution, conditionally, supporting, the, fight, against, fascism, but, were, rebuffed, when, they, asked, for, self, rule, in, return, in, march, 1942, faced, with, an, increasingly, dissatisfied, sub, continent, only, reluctantly, participating, in, the, war, and, deteriorations, in, the, war, situation, in, europe, and, south, east, asia, and, with, growing, dissatisfactions, among, indian, troops, especially, in, europe, and, among, the, civilian, population, in, the, sub, continent, the, british, government, sent, a, delegation, to, india, under, stafford, cripps, in, what, came, to, be, known, as, the, cripps, mission, the, purpose, of, the, mission, was, to, negotiate, with, the, indian, national, congress, a, deal, to, obtain, total, co, operation, during, the, war, in, return, of, progressive, devolution, and, distribution, of, power, from, the, crown, and, the, viceroy, to, elected, indian, legislature, however, the, talks, failed, having, failed, to, address, the, key, demand, of, a, timeframe, towards, self, government, and, of, the, definition, of, the, powers, to, be, relinquished, essentially, portraying, an, offer, of, limited, dominion, status, that, was, wholly, unacceptable, to, the, indian, movement, to, force, the, british, raj, to, meet, its, demands, and, to, obtain, definitive, word, on, total, self, rule, the, congress, took, the, decision, to, launch, the, quit, india, movement, the, aim, of, the, movement, was, to, force, the, british, government, to, the, negotiating, table, by, holding, the, allied, war, effort, hostage, the, call, for, determined, but, passive, resistance, that, signified, the, certitude, that, gandhi, foresaw, for, the, movement, is, best, described, by, his, call, to, do, or, die, issued, on, 8, august, at, the, gowalia, tank, maidan, in, bombay, since, renamed, august, kranti, maidan, august, revolution, ground, however, almost, the, entire, congress, leadership, and, not, merely, at, the, national, level, was, put, into, confinement, less, than, 24, hours, after, gandhi, s, speech, and, the, greater, number, of, the, congress, were, to, spend, the, rest, of, the, war, in, jail, on, 8, august, 1942, the, quit, india, resolution, was, passed, at, the, mumbai, session, of, the, all, india, congress, committee, aicc, the, draft, proposed, that, if, the, british, did, not, accede, to, the, demands, a, massive, civil, disobedience, would, be, launched, however, it, was, an, extremely, controversial, decision, at, gowalia, tank, mumbai, gandhi, urged, indians, to, follow, non, violent, civil, disobedience, gandhi, told, the, masses, to, act, as, citizens, of, a, sovereign, nation, and, not, to, follow, the, orders, of, the, british, the, british, already, alarmed, by, the, advance, of, the, japanese, army, to, the, india, burma, border, responded, the, next, day, by, imprisoning, gandhi, at, the, aga, khan, palace, in, pune, the, congress, party, s, working, committee, or, national, leadership, was, arrested, all, together, and, imprisoned, at, the, ahmednagar, fort, they, also, banned, the, party, altogether, all, the, major, leaders, of, the, inc, were, arrested, and, detained, as, the, masses, were, leaderless, the, protest, took, a, violent, turn, large, scale, protests, and, demonstrations, were, held, all, over, the, country, workers, remained, absent, en, masse, and, strikes, were, called, the, movement, also, saw, widespread, acts, of, sabotage, indian, under, ground, organisation, carried, out, bomb, attacks, on, allied, supply, convoys, government, buildings, were, set, on, fire, electricity, lines, were, disconnected, and, transport, and, communication, lines, were, severed, the, disruptions, were, under, control, in, a, few, weeks, and, had, little, impact, on, the, war, effort, the, movement, soon, became, a, leaderless, act, of, defiance, with, a, number, of, acts, that, deviated, from, gandhi, s, principle, of, non, violence, in, large, parts, of, the, country, the, local, underground, organisations, took, over, the, movement, all, the, other, major, parties, rejected, the, quit, india, plan, and, most, cooperated, closely, with, the, british, as, did, the, princely, states, the, civil, service, and, the, police, the, muslim, league, supported, the, raj, and, grew, rapidly, in, membership, and, in, influence, with, the, british, there, was, opposition, to, the, quit, india, movement, from, several, political, quarters, who, were, fighting, for, indian, self, rule, hindu, nationalist, parties, like, the, hindu, mahasabha, openly, opposed, the, call, and, boycotted, the, quit, india, movement, vinayak, damodar, savarkar, the, president, of, the, hindu, mahasabha, at, that, time, even, went, to, the, extent, of, writing, a, letter, titled, stick, to, your, posts, in, which, he, instructed, hindu, sabhaites, who, happened, to, be, members, of, municipalities, local, bodies, legislatures, or, those, serving, in, the, army, to, stick, to, their, posts, across, the, country, and, not, to, join, the, quit, india, movement, at, any, cost, the, other, hindu, nationalist, organisation, and, mahasabha, affiliate, rashtriya, swayamsevak, sangh, rss, had, a, tradition, of, keeping, aloof, from, the, anti, british, indian, self, rule, movement, since, its, founding, by, k, b, hedgewar, in, 1925, in, 1942, the, rss, under, m, s, golwalkar, completely, abstained, from, joining, in, the, quit, india, movement, as, well, the, bombay, government, british, appreciated, the, rss, as, such, by, noting, that, the, sangh, has, scrupulously, kept, itself, within, the, law, and, in, particular, has, refrained, from, taking, part, in, the, disturbances, that, broke, out, in, august, 1942, the, british, government, stated, that, the, rss, was, not, at, all, supporting, any, civil, disobedience, against, them, and, as, such, their, other, political, activities, even, if, objectionable, can, be, overlooked, further, the, british, government, also, asserted, that, at, sangh, meetings, organised, during, the, times, of, anti, british, movements, started, and, fought, by, the, indian, national, congress, speakers, urged, the, sangh, members, to, keep, aloof, from, the, congress, movement, and, these, instructions, were, generally, observed, as, such, the, british, government, did, not, crackdown, on, the, rss, and, hindu, mahasabha, at, all, the, rss, head, sarsanghchalak, during, that, time, m, s, golwalkar, later, openly, admitted, to, the, fact, that, the, rss, did, not, participate, in, the, quit, india, movement, however, such, an, attitude, during, the, indian, independence, movement, also, led, to, the, sangh, being, viewed, with, distrust, and, anger, both, by, the, general, indian, public, as, well, as, certain, members, of, the, organisation, itself, in, golwalkar, s, own, words, in, 1942, also, there, was, a, strong, sentiment, in, the, hearts, of, many, at, that, time, too, the, routine, work, of, the, sangh, continued, sangh, decided, not, to, do, anything, directly, sangh, is, the, organisation, of, inactive, people, their, talks, have, no, substance, was, the, opinion, uttered, not, only, by, outsiders, but, also, our, own, swayamsevaks, a, number, of, violent, incidents, against, british, officials, also, took, place, during, the, quit, india, movement, around, the, country, the, british, arrested, tens, of, thousands, of, leaders, keeping, them, imprisoned, until, 1945, ultimately, the, british, government, realised, that, india, was, ungovernable, in, the, long, run, and, the, question, for, the, postwar, era, became, how, to, exit, gracefully, and, peacefully, india, s, entry, into, the, world, war, was, strongly, opposed, by, subhas, chandra, bose, bose, had, been, elected, president, of, the, congress, in, 1938, and, 1939, but, later, resigned, owing, to, differences, of, opinion, with, the, congress, however, he, remained, emotionally, attached, to, congress, for, the, remainder, of, his, life, after, his, resignation, he, formed, his, own, wing, separated, from, the, mainstream, congress, leadership, known, as, forward, bloc, which, was, a, loci, focus, for, ex, congress, leaders, holding, socialist, views, bose, then, founded, the, all, india, forward, bloc, in, 1940, the, british, authorities, in, calcutta, placed, bose, under, house, arrest, however, he, escaped, and, made, his, way, through, afghanistan, to, nazi, germany, to, seek, hitler, and, mussolini, s, help, for, raising, an, army, to, fight, the, british,

expatriates, in, south, east, asia, with, the, help, of, the, japanese, its, aim, was, to, reach, india, as, a, fighting, force, that, would, build, on, public, resentment, to, inspire, revolt, among,

number, of, japanese, officers, even, those, like, fujiwara, who, were, devoted, to, the, indian, cause, observed, bose, as, a, military, incompetent, as, well, as, an, unrealistic, and, stubborn, man, who, sees, only, his, own, needs, and, problems, and, could, not, observe, the, larger, picture, of, the, war, as, the, japanese, had, to, the, ina, failed, owing, to, disrupted, logistics, poor, supplies, from, the, japanese, and, lack, of, training, the, azad, hind, fauj, surrendered, unconditionally, to, the, british, in, singapore, in, 1945, subhas, chandra, bose, s, death, occurred, from,

subsequent, mutiny, by, indian, sailors, of, the, royal, indian, navy, on, board, ship, and, shore, establishments, at, bombay, mumbai, harbour, on, 18, february, 1946, from, the, initial, flashpoint, in, bombay, the, mutiny, spread, and, found, support, throughout, british, india, from, karachi, to, calcutta, and, ultimately, came, to, involve, 78, ships, 20, shore, establishments, and, 10, 000, sailors, the, agitations, mass, strikes, demonstrations, and, consequently, support, for, the, mutineers, therefore, continued, several, days, even, after, the, mutiny, had, been, called, off, along, with, this, the, assessment, may, be, made, that, it, described, in, crystal, clear, terms, to, the, government, that, the, british, indian, armed, forces, could, no, longer, be, universally, relied, upon, for, support, in, crisis, and, even, more, it, was, more, likely, itself, to, be, the, source, of, the, sparks, that, would, ignite, trouble, in, a, country, fast, slipping, out, of, the, scenario, of, political, settlement, the, mutiny, ended, with, the, surrender, of, revolting, the, sailors, to, british, officials, congress, and, the, muslim, league, had, convinced, indian, sailors,
