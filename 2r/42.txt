canaan, state, of, israel, 1948, present, the, history, of, israel, covers, an, area, of, the, southern, levant, also, known, as, canaan, palestine, or, the, holy, land, which, is, the, geographical, location, of, the, modern, states, of, israel, and, palestine, from, a, prehistory, as, part, of, the, critical, levantine, corridor, which, witnessed, waves, of, early, humans, out, of, africa, to, the, emergence, of, natufian, culture, c, 10th, millennium, bce, the, region, entered, the, bronze, age, c, 2, 000, bce, with, the, development, of, canaanite, civilization, before, being, vassalized, by, egypt, in, the, late, bronze, age, in, the, iron, age, the, kingdoms, of, israel, and, judah, were, established, entities, that, were, central, to, the, origins, of, the, jewish, and, samaritan, peoples, as, well, as, the, abrahamic, faith, tradition, this, has, given, rise, to, judaism, samaritanism, christianity, islam, druzism, baha, ism, and, a, variety, of, other, religious, movements, throughout, the, course, of, human, history, the, land, of, israel, has, seen, many, conflicts, and, come, under, the, sway, or, control, of, various, polities, and, as, a, result, it, has, historically, hosted, a, wide, variety, of, ethnic, groups, in, the, following, centuries, the, assyrian, babylonian, persian, and, macedonian, empires, conquered, the, region, the, ptolemies, and, the, seleucids, vied, for, control, over, the, region, during, the, hellenistic, period, however, with, the, establishment, of, the, hasmonean, dynasty, the, local, jewish, population, maintained, independence, for, a, century, before, being, incorporated, into, the, roman, republic, as, a, result, of, the, jewish, roman, wars, in, the, 1st, and, 2nd, centuries, ce, many, jews, were, killed, displaced, or, sold, into, slavery, following, the, advent, of, christianity, which, was, adopted, by, the, greco, roman, world, under, the, influence, of, the, roman, empire, the, region, s, demographics, shifted, towards, newfound, christians, who, replaced, jews, as, the, majority, of, the, population, by, the, 4th, century, however, shortly, after, islam, was, consolidated, across, the, arabian, peninsula, under, muhammad, in, the, 7th, century, byzantine, christian, rule, over, the, land, of, israel, was, superseded, in, the, muslim, conquest, of, the, levant, by, the, rashidun, caliphate, to, later, be, ruled, by, the, umayyad, abbasid, and, fatimid, caliphates, before, being, conquered, by, the, seljuks, in, the, 1070s, throughout, the, 12th, and, much, of, the, 13th, century, the, land, of, israel, became, the, centre, for, intermittent, religious, wars, between, european, christian, and, muslim, armies, as, part, of, the, crusades, with, the, kingdom, of, jerusalem, being, almost, entirely, overrun, by, saladin, s, ayyubids, late, in, the, 12th, century, although, the, crusaders, managed, to, first, expand, from, their, remaining, outposts, and, then, hang, on, to, their, constantly, decreasing, territories, for, another, century, in, the, 13th, century, the, land, of, israel, became, subject, to, mongol, conquest, though, this, was, stopped, by, the, mamluk, sultanate, under, whose, rule, it, remained, until, the, 16th, century, the, mamluks, were, eventually, defeated, by, the, ottoman, empire, and, the, region, became, an, ottoman, province, until, the, early, 20th, century, the, late, 19th, century, saw, the, rise, of, a, jewish, nationalist, movement, in, europe, known, as, zionism, as, part, of, which, aliyah, jewish, immigration, to, the, land, of, israel, from, the, diaspora, increased, during, world, war, i, the, sinai, and, palestine, campaign, of, the, allies, led, to, the, partitioning, of, the, ottoman, empire, britain, was, granted, control, of, the, region, by, league, of, nations, mandate, in, what, became, known, as, mandatory, palestine, the, british, government, had, publicly, committed, itself, to, the, creation, of, a, jewish, homeland, in, the, 1917, balfour, declaration, palestinian, arabs, opposed, this, design, asserting, their, rights, over, the, former, ottoman, territories, and, seeking, to, prevent, jewish, immigration, as, a, result, arab, jewish, tensions, grew, in, the, succeeding, decades, of, british, administration, in, late, 1947, the, united, nations, voted, for, the, partition, of, mandate, palestine, and, the, creation, of, a, jewish, and, an, arab, state, on, its, territory, the, jews, accepted, the, plan, while, the, arabs, rejected, it, a, civil, war, ensued, won, by, the, jews, in, may, 1948, the, israeli, declaration, of, independence, sparked, the, 1948, war, in, which, israel, repelled, the, invading, armies, of, the, neighbouring, states, it, resulted, in, the, 1948, palestinian, expulsion, and, flight, and, subsequently, led, to, waves, of, jewish, emigration, from, other, parts, of, the, middle, east, today, approximately, 43, percent, of, the, global, jewish, population, resides, in, israel, in, 1979, the, egypt, israel, peace, treaty, was, signed, based, on, the, camp, david, accords, in, 1993, israel, signed, the, oslo, i, accord, with, the, palestine, liberation, organization, which, was, followed, by, the, establishment, of, the, palestinian, national, authority, in, 1994, the, israel, jordan, peace, treaty, was, signed, despite, efforts, to, finalize, the, peace, agreement, the, conflict, continues, to, play, a, major, role, in, israeli, and, international, political, social, and, economic, life, the, oldest, evidence, of, early, humans, in, the, territory, of, modern, israel, dating, to, 1, 5, million, years, ago, was, found, in, ubeidiya, near, the, sea, of, galilee, flint, tool, artefacts, have, been, discovered, at, yiron, the, oldest, stone, tools, found, anywhere, outside, africa, other, groups, include, 1, 4, million, years, old, acheulean, industry, the, bizat, ruhama, group, and, gesher, bnot, yaakov, in, the, mount, carmel, area, at, el, tabun, and, es, skhul, neanderthal, and, early, modern, human, remains, were, found, showing, the, longest, stratigraphic, record, in, the, region, spanning, 600, 000, years, of, human, activity, from, the, lower, paleolithic, to, the, present, day, representing, roughly, a, million, years, of, human, evolution, other, notable, paleolithic, sites, include, caves, qesem, and, manot, the, oldest, fossils, of, anatomically, modern, humans, found, outside, africa, are, the, skhul, and, qafzeh, hominids, who, lived, in, northern, israel, 120, 000, years, ago, around, 10th, millennium, bce, the, natufian, culture, existed, in, the, area, here, is, one, of, the, more, common, periodisations, the, canaanites, are, archaeologically, attested, in, the, middle, bronze, age, 2100, 1550, bce, there, were, probably, independent, or, semi, independent, city, states, cities, were, often, surrounded, by, massive, earthworks, resulting, in, the, archaeological, mounds, or, tells, common, in, the, region, today, in, the, late, middle, bronze, age, the, nile, delta, in, egypt, was, settled, by, canaanites, who, maintained, close, connections, with, canaan, during, that, period, the, hyksos, dynasties, of, canaanite, asiatic, origin, ruled, much, of, lower, egypt, before, being, overthrown, in, the, 16th, century, bce, during, the, late, bronze, age, 1550, 1200, bce, there, were, canaanite, vassal, states, paying, tribute, to, the, new, kingdom, of, egypt, which, governed, from, gaza, in, 1457, bce, egyptian, forces, under, the, command, of, pharaoh, thutmose, iii, defeated, a, rebellious, coalition, of, canaanite, vassal, states, led, by, kadesh, s, king, at, the, battle, of, megiddo, in, the, late, bronze, age, there, was, a, period, of, civilizational, collapse, in, the, middle, east, canaan, fell, into, chaos, and, egyptian, control, ended, there, is, evidence, that, urban, centers, such, as, hazor, beit, she, an, megiddo, ekron, isdud, and, ascalon, were, damaged, or, destroyed, two, groups, appear, at, this, time, and, are, associated, with, the, transition, to, the, iron, age, they, used, iron, weapons, tools, which, were, better, than, earlier, bronze, the, sea, peoples, particularly, the, philistines, who, migrated, from, the, aegean, world, and, settled, on, the, southern, coast, and, the, israelites, whose, settlements, dotted, the, highlands, some, 2nd, millennium, inscriptions, about, the, semi, nomadic, habiru, people, are, believed, to, be, connected, to, the, hebrews, who, were, generally, synonymous, with, the, biblical, israelites, many, scholars, regard, this, connection, to, be, plausible, since, the, two, ethnonyms, have, similar, etymologies, although, others, argue, that, habiru, refers, to, a, social, class, found, in, every, near, eastern, society, including, hebrew, societies, the, earliest, recorded, evidence, of, a, people, by, the, name, of, israel, as, ysr, r, occurs, in, the, egyptian, merneptah, stele, erected, for, pharaoh, merneptah, son, of, ramesses, ii, c, 1209, bce, which, states, israel, is, laid, waste, and, his, seed, is, not, archeological, evidence, indicates, that, during, the, early, iron, age, i, hundreds, of, small, villages, were, established, on, the, highlands, of, canaan, on, both, sides, of, the, jordan, river, primarily, in, samaria, north, of, jerusalem, these, villages, had, populations, of, up, to, 400, were, largely, self, sufficient, and, lived, from, herding, grain, cultivation, and, growing, vines, and, olives, with, some, economic, interchange, the, pottery, was, plain, and, undecorated, writing, was, known, and, available, for, recording, even, in, small, sites, william, g, dever, sees, this, israel, in, the, central, highlands, as, a, cultural, and, probably, political, entity, more, an, ethnic, group, rather, than, an, organized, state, modern, scholars, believe, that, the, israelites, and, their, culture, branched, out, of, the, canaanite, peoples, and, their, cultures, through, the, development, of, a, distinct, monolatristic, and, later, monotheistic, religion, centred, on, a, national, god, yahweh, according, to, mcnutt, it, is, probably, safe, to, assume, that, sometime, during, iron, age, i, a, population, began, to, identify, itself, as, israelite, differentiating, itself, from, the, canaanites, through, such, markers, as, the, prohibition, of, intermarriage, an, emphasis, on, family, history, and, genealogy, and, religion, philistine, cooking, tools, and, the, prevalence, of, pork, in, their, diets, and, locally, made, mycenaean, pottery, which, later, evolved, into, bichrome, philistine, pottery, all, support, their, foreign, origin, their, cities, were, large, and, elaborate, which, together, with, the, findings, point, out, to, a, complex, hierarchical, society, a, stele, of, seti, i, found, in, beth, she, an, dating, to, ca, 1289, bce, revealed, that, a, raham, tribe, lived, in, israel, they, were, named, after, the, biblical, abraham, israel, finkelstein, believes, that, the, oldest, abraham, traditions, originated, in, the, iron, age, which, focus, on, the, themes, of, land, and, offspring, and, possibly, his, altars, in, hebron, abraham, s, mesopotamian, heritage, is, not, discussed, in, the, 10th, century, bce, the, israelite, kingdoms, of, judah, and, israel, emerged, the, hebrew, bible, states, that, these, were, preceded, by, a, single, kingdom, ruled, by, saul, david, and, solomon, who, is, said, to, have, built, the, first, temple, archaeologists, have, debated, whether, the, united, monarchy, ever, existed, with, those, in, favor, of, such, a, polity, existing, further, divided, between, maximalists, who, support, the, biblical, accounts, and, minimalists, who, argue, that, any, such, polity, was, likely, smaller, than, suggested, historians, and, archaeologists, agree, that, the, northern, kingdom, of, israel, existed, by, ca, 900, bce, and, the, kingdom, of, judah, existed, by, ca, 850, bce, the, kingdom, of, israel, was, the, more, prosperous, of, the, two, kingdoms, and, soon, developed, into, a, regional, power, during, the, days, of, the, omride, dynasty, it, controlled, samaria, galilee, the, upper, jordan, valley, the, sharon, and, large, parts, of, the, transjordan, samaria, the, capital, was, home, to, one, of, the, largest, iron, age, structures, in, the, levant, the, kingdom, of, israel, s, capital, moved, between, shechem, penuel, and, tirzah, before, omri, settled, it, in, samaria, and, the, royal, succession, was, often, settled, by, a, military, coup, d, tat, the, kingdom, of, judah, was, smaller, but, more, stable, the, davidic, dynasty, ruled, the, kingdom, for, the, four, centuries, of, its, existence, with, the, capital, always, in, jerusalem, controlling, the, judaean, mountains, most, of, the, shephelah, and, the, beersheba, valley, in, the, northern, negev, in, 854, bce, according, to, assyrian, records, the, kurkh, monoliths, an, alliance, between, ahab, of, israel, and, ben, hadad, ii, of, aram, damascus, managed, to, repulse, the, incursions, of, the, assyrians, with, a, victory, at, the, battle, of, qarqar, this, is, not, reported, in, the, bible, which, describes, conflict, between, ahab, and, ben, hadad, another, important, discovery, of, the, period, is, the, mesha, stele, a, moabite, stele, found, in, dhiban, when, emir, sattam, al, fayez, led, henry, tristram, to, it, as, they, toured, the, lands, of, the, vassals, of, the, bani, sakher, the, stele, is, now, in, the, louvre, in, the, stele, mesha, king, of, moab, tells, how, chemosh, the, god, of, moab, had, been, angry, with, his, people, and, had, allowed, them, to, be, subjugated, to, the, kingdom, of, israel, but, at, length, chemosh, returned, and, assisted, mesha, to, throw, off, the, yoke, of, israel, and, restore, the, lands, of, moab, it, refers, to, omri, king, of, israel, to, the, god, yahweh, and, may, contain, another, early, reference, to, the, house, of, david, jehu, son, of, omri, is, referenced, by, the, black, obelisk, of, shalmaneser, iii, tiglath, pileser, iii, of, assyria, invaded, israel, in, around, 732, bce, the, kingdom, of, israel, fell, to, the, assyrians, following, a, long, siege, of, the, capital, samaria, around, 720, bce, the, records, of, sargon, ii, of, assyria, indicate, that, he, captured, samaria, and, deported, 27, 290, inhabitants, to, mesopotamia, it, is, likely, that, shalmaneser, captured, the, city, since, both, the, babylonian, chronicles, and, the, hebrew, bible, viewed, the, fall, of, israel, as, the, signature, event, of, his, reign, the, assyrian, deportations, became, the, basis, for, the, jewish, idea, of, the, ten, lost, tribes, foreign, groups, were, settled, by, the, assyrians, in, the, territories, of, the, fallen, kingdom, the, samaritans, claim, to, be, descended, from, israelites, of, ancient, samaria, who, were, not, expelled, by, the, assyrians, it, is, believed, that, refugees, from, the, destruction, of, israel, moved, to, judah, massively, expanding, jerusalem, and, leading, to, construction, of, the, siloam, tunnel, during, the, rule, of, king, hezekiah, ruled, 715, 686, bce, the, tunnel, could, provide, water, during, a, siege, and, its, construction, is, described, in, the, bible, the, siloam, inscription, a, plaque, written, in, hebrew, left, by, the, construction, team, was, discovered, in, the, tunnel, in, 1880s, and, is, today, held, by, the, istanbul, archaeology, museum, during, hezekiah, s, rule, sennacherib, the, son, of, sargon, attempted, but, failed, to, capture, judah, assyrian, records, say, that, sennacherib, levelled, 46, walled, cities, and, besieged, jerusalem, leaving, after, receiving, extensive, tribute, sennacherib, erected, the, lachish, reliefs, in, nineveh, to, commemorate, a, second, victory, at, lachish, the, writings, of, four, different, prophets, are, believed, to, date, from, this, period, hosea, and, amos, in, israel, and, micah, and, isaiah, of, judah, these, men, were, mostly, social, critics, who, warned, of, the, assyrian, threat, and, acted, as, religious, spokesmen, they, exercised, some, form, of, free, speech, and, may, have, played, a, significant, social, and, political, role, in, israel, and, judah, they, urged, rulers, and, the, general, populace, to, adhere, to, god, conscious, ethical, ideals, seeing, the, assyrian, invasions, as, a, divine, punishment, of, the, collective, resulting, from, ethical, failures, under, king, josiah, ruler, from, 641, 619, bce, the, book, of, deuteronomy, was, either, rediscovered, or, written, the, book, of, joshua, and, the, accounts, of, the, kingship, of, david, and, solomon, in, the, book, of, kings, are, believed, to, have, the, same, author, the, books, are, known, as, deuteronomist, and, considered, to, be, a, key, step, in, the, emergence, of, monotheism, in, judah, they, emerged, at, a, time, that, assyria, was, weakened, by, the, emergence, of, babylon, and, may, be, a, committing, to, text, of, pre, writing, verbal, traditions, during, the, late, 7th, century, bce, judah, became, a, vassal, state, of, the, neo, babylonian, empire, in, 601, bce, jehoiakim, of, judah, allied, with, babylon, s, principal, rival, egypt, despite, the, strong, remonstrances, of, the, prophet, jeremiah, as, a, punishment, the, babylonians, besieged, jerusalem, in, 597, bce, and, the, city, surrendered, the, defeat, was, recorded, by, the, babylonians, nebuchadnezzar, pillaged, jerusalem, and, deported, king, jechoiachin, jeconiah, along, with, other, prominent, citizens, to, babylon, zedekiah, his, uncle, was, installed, as, king, a, few, years, later, zedekiah, launched, another, revolt, against, babylon, and, an, army, was, sent, to, conquer, jerusalem, in, 587, or, 586, bce, king, nebuchadnezzar, ii, of, babylon, conquered, jerusalem, destroyed, the, first, temple, and, razed, the, city, the, kingdom, of, judah, was, abolished, and, many, of, its, citizens, were, exiled, to, babylon, the, former, territory, of, judah, became, a, babylonian, province, called, yehud, with, its, center, in, mizpah, north, of, the, destroyed, jerusalem, tablets, that, describe, king, jehoiachin, s, rations, were, found, in, the, ruins, of, babylon, he, was, eventually, released, by, the, babylonians, according, to, both, the, bible, and, the, talmud, the, davidic, dynasty, continued, as, head, of, babylonian, jewry, called, the, rosh, galut, exilarch, or, head, of, exile, arab, and, jewish, sources, show, that, the, rosh, galut, continued, to, exist, for, another, 1, 500, years, in, what, is, now, iraq, ending, in, the, eleventh, century, in, 538, bce, cyrus, the, great, of, the, achaemenid, empire, conquered, babylon, and, took, over, its, empire, cyrus, issued, a, proclamation, granting, religious, freedom, to, all, peoples, subjugated, by, the, babylonians, see, the, cyrus, cylinder, according, to, the, bible, jewish, exiles, in, babylon, including, 50, 000, judeans, led, by, zerubabel, returned, to, judah, to, rebuild, the, temple, in, jerusalem, the, second, temple, was, subsequently, completed, c, 515, bce, a, second, group, of, 5, 000, led, by, ezra, and, nehemiah, returned, to, judah, in, 456, bce, the, first, was, empowered, by, the, persian, king, to, enforce, religious, rules, the, second, had, the, status, of, governor, and, a, royal, mission, to, restore, the, walls, of, the, city, the, country, remained, a, province, of, the, achaemenid, empire, called, yehud, until, 332, bce, the, final, text, of, the, torah, the, first, five, books, of, the, bible, is, thought, to, have, been, written, during, the, persian, period, probably, 450, 350, bce, the, text, was, formed, by, editing, and, unifying, earlier, texts, the, returning, israelites, adopted, an, aramaic, script, also, known, as, the, ashuri, alphabet, which, they, brought, back, from, babylon, this, is, the, current, hebrew, script, the, hebrew, calendar, closely, resembles, the, babylonian, calendar, and, probably, dates, from, this, period, the, bible, describes, tension, between, the, returnees, the, elite, of, the, first, temple, period, and, those, who, had, remained, in, judah, it, is, possible, that, the, returnees, supported, by, the, persian, monarchy, became, large, landholders, at, the, expense, of, the, people, who, had, remained, to, work, the, land, in, judah, whose, opposition, to, the, second, temple, would, have, reflected, a, fear, that, exclusion, from, the, cult, would, deprive, them, of, land, rights, judah, had, become, in, practice, a, theocracy, ruled, by, hereditary, high, priests, and, a, persian, appointed, governor, frequently, jewish, charged, with, keeping, order, and, seeing, that, tribute, was, paid, a, judean, military, garrison, was, placed, by, the, persians, on, elephantine, island, near, aswan, in, egypt, in, the, early, 20th, century, 175, papyrus, documents, recording, activity, in, this, community, were, discovered, including, the, passover, papyrus, a, letter, instructing, the, garrison, on, how, to, correctly, conduct, the, passover, feast, in, 332, bce, alexander, the, great, of, macedon, conquered, the, region, as, part, of, his, campaign, against, the, persian, empire, after, his, death, in, 322, bce, his, generals, divided, the, empire, and, judea, became, a, frontier, region, between, the, seleucid, empire, and, ptolemaic, kingdom, in, egypt, following, a, century, of, ptolemaic, rule, judea, was, conquered, by, the, seleucid, empire, in, 200, bce, at, the, battle, of, panium, hellenistic, rulers, generally, respected, jewish, culture, and, protected, jewish, institutions, judea, was, ruled, by, the, hereditary, office, of, the, high, priest, of, israel, as, a, hellenistic, vassal, nevertheless, the, region, underwent, a, process, of, hellenization, which, heightened, tensions, between, greeks, hellenized, jews, and, observant, jews, these, tensions, escalated, into, clashes, involving, a, power, struggle, for, the, position, of, high, priest, and, the, character, of, the, holy, city, of, jerusalem, when, antiochus, iv, epiphanes, consecrated, the, temple, forbade, jewish, practices, and, forcibly, imposed, hellenistic, norms, on, the, jews, several, centuries, of, religious, tolerance, under, hellenistic, control, came, to, an, end, in, 167, bce, the, maccabean, revolt, erupted, after, mattathias, a, jewish, priest, of, the, hasmonean, lineage, killed, a, hellenized, jew, and, a, seleucid, official, who, participated, in, sacrifice, to, the, greek, gods, in, modi, in, his, son, judas, maccabeus, defeated, the, seleucids, in, several, battles, and, in, 164, bce, he, captured, jerusalem, and, restored, temple, worship, an, event, commemorated, by, the, jewish, festival, of, hannukah, after, judas, death, his, brothers, jonathan, apphus, and, simon, thassi, were, able, to, establish, and, consolidate, a, vassal, hasmonean, state, in, judea, capitalizing, on, the, seleucid, empire, s, decline, as, a, result, of, internal, instability, and, wars, with, the, parthians, and, by, forging, ties, with, the, rising, roman, republic, hasmonean, leader, john, hyrcanus, was, able, to, gain, independence, doubling, judea, s, territories, he, took, control, of, idumaea, where, he, converted, the, edomites, to, judaism, and, invaded, scythopolis, and, samaria, where, he, demolished, the, samaritan, temple, hyrcanus, was, also, the, first, hasmonean, leader, to, mint, coins, under, his, sons, kings, aristobulus, i, and, alexander, jannaeus, hasmonean, judea, became, a, kingdom, and, its, territories, continued, to, expand, now, also, covering, the, coastal, plain, galilee, and, parts, of, the, transjordan, some, scholars, argue, that, the, hasmonean, dynasty, also, institutionalized, the, final, jewish, biblical, canon, under, hasmonean, rule, the, pharisees, sadducees, and, the, mystic, essenes, emerged, as, the, principal, jewish, social, movements, the, pharisee, sage, simeon, ben, shetach, is, credited, with, establishing, the, first, schools, based, around, meeting, houses, this, was, a, key, step, in, the, emergence, of, rabbinical, judaism, after, jannaeus, widow, queen, salome, alexandra, died, in, 67, bce, her, sons, hyrcanus, ii, and, aristobulus, ii, engaged, in, a, civil, war, over, succession,

form, of, judaism, from, 115, to, 117, tensions, and, attacks, on, jews, around, the, roman, empire, led, to, a, massive, jewish, uprising, against, rome, known, as, the, kitos, war, jews, in, libya, egypt, cyprus, and, mesopotamia, fought, against, rome, this, conflict, was, accompanied, by, large, scale, massacres, of, both, sides, cyprus, was, so, severely, depopulated, that, new, settlers, were, imported, and, jews, banned, from, living, there, in, 132, ce, the, bar, kokhba, revolt, erupted, the, uprising, was, led, by, a, jew, named, simon, bar, kokhba, who, ruled, as, nasi, and, was, viewed, by, some, of, the, rabbis, of, the, period, as, the, long, awaited, messiah, based, on, the, bar, kokhba, revolt, coinage, the, independent, jewish, state, was, named, israel, it, has, been, suggested, that, a, rabbinical, assembly, which, convened, during, the, revolt, decided, which, books, could, be, regarded, as, part, of, the, hebrew, bible, the, jewish, apocrypha, and, christian, books, were, excluded, as, a, result, the, original, text, of, some, hebrew, texts, including, the, books, of, maccabees, were, lost, greek, translations, survived, a, rabbi, of, this, period, simeon, bar, yochai, is, regarded, as, the, author, of, the, zohar, the, foundational, text, for, kabbalistic, thought, however, modern, scholars, believe, it, was, written, in, medieval, spain, christians, refused, to, participate, in, the, revolt, and, from, this, point, the, jews, regarded, christianity, as, a, separate, religion, the, bar, kokhba, revolt, was, eventually, crushed, by, emperor, hadrian, himself, with, serious, losses, today, it, is, viewed, by, modern, scholars, as, having, decisive, historic, importance, according, to, cassius, dio, writing, in, the, century, following, the, revolt, 50, of, the, jews, most, important, outposts, and, 985, of, their, most, famous, villages, were, razed, to, the, ground, 580, 000, men, were, slain, in, the, various, raids, and, battles, and, the, number, of, those, that, perished, by, famine, disease, and, fire, was, past, finding, out, thus, nearly, the, whole, of, judaea, was, made, desolate, while, scholars, debate, whether, these, numbers, are, accurate, archaeological, surveys, and, excavations, appear, to, confirm, the, claim, of, cassius, dio, that, the, district, of, judaea, was, largely, depopulated, most, scholars, agree, that, in, contrast, to, the, aftermath, of, the, first, jewish, roman, war, judea, was, devastated, after, the, bar, kokhba, revolt, with, many, jews, killed, exiled, or, sold, into, slavery, around, the, time, of, the, revolt, the, province, of, judaea, iudaea, was, renamed, syria, palaestina, the, commonly, held, view, is, that, it, was, implemented, as, punishment, for, the, bar, kokhba, revolt, or, to, disassociate, the, jewish, people, from, their, historical, homeland, and, hold, hadrian, accountable, however, no, evidence, exists, for, this, narrative, and, it, has, been, disputed, by, scholars, in, recent, years, no, other, revolt, led, to, a, province, being, renamed, as, a, result, of, the, disastrous, effects, of, the, bar, kokhba, revolt, jewish, presence, in, the, region, significantly, dwindled, over, the, next, centuries, more, jews, left, to, communities, in, the, diaspora, especially, the, large, speedily, growing, jewish, communities, in, babylonia, and, arabia, others, remained, in, the, land, of, israel, where, the, spiritual, and, demographic, center, shifted, from, the, depopulated, judea, to, galilee, jewish, presence, also, continued, in,

of, the, empire, the, romans, permitted, a, hereditary, rabbinical, patriarch, from, the, house, of, hillel, called, the, nasi, to, represent, the, jews, in, dealings, with, the, romans, one, prominent, figure, was, judah, ha, nasi, credited, with, compiling, the, final, version, of, the, mishnah, a, vast, collection, of, jewish, oral, traditions, he, also, emphasized, the, importance, of, education, in, judaism, leading, to, requirements, that, illiterate, jews, be, treated, as, outcasts, this, might, have, contributed, to, some, illiterate, jews, converting, to, christianity, jewish, seminaries, such, as, those, at, shefaram, and, bet, shearim, continued, to, produce, scholars, the, best, of, these, became, members, of, the, sanhedrin, which, was, located, first, at, sepphoris, and, later, at, tiberias, in, the, galillee, many, synagogues, have, been, found, dating, from, this, period, and, the, burial, site, of, the, sanhedrin, leaders, was, discovered, in, beit, she, arim, in, the, 3rd, century, the, roman, empire, faced, an, economic, crisis, and, imposed, heavy, taxation, to, fund, wars, of, imperial, succession, this, situation, prompted, additional, jewish, migration, from, syria, palaestina, to, the, sasanian, empire, known, for, its, more, tolerant, environment, there, a, flourishing, jewish, community, with, important, talmudic, academies, thrived, in, babylonia, engaging, in, a, notable, rivalry, with, the, talmudic, academies, of, palaestina, early, in, the, 4th, century, the, emperor, constantine, made, constantinople, the, capital, of, the, east, roman, empire, and, made, christianity, an, accepted, religion, his, mother, helena, made, a, pilgrimage, to, jerusalem, 326, 328, and, led, the, construction, of, the, church, of, the,

empire, known, as, the, byzantine, empire, under, byzantine, rule, much, of, the, region, and, its, non, jewish, population, were, won, over, by, christianity, which, eventually, became, the, dominant, religion, in, the, region, the, presence, of, holy, sites, drew, christian, pilgrims, some, of, whom, chose, to, settle, contributing, to, the, rise, of, a, christian, majority, christian, authorities, encouraged, this, pilgrimage, movement, and, appropriated, lands, constructing, magnificent, churches, at, locations, linked, to, biblical, narratives, additionally, monks, established, monasteries, near, pagan, settlements, encouraging, the, conversion, of, local, pagans, during, the, byzantine, period, the, jewish, presence, in, the, region, declined, and, it, is, believed, that, jews, lost, their, majority, status, in, palestine, in, the, fourth, century, while, judaism, remained, the, sole, non, christian, religion, tolerated, restrictions, on, jews, gradually, increased, prohibiting, the, construction, of, new, places, of, worship, holding, public, office, or, owning, christian, slaves, in, 425, after, the, death, of, the, last, nasi, gamliel, vi, the, nasi, office, and, the, sanhedrin, were, officially, abolished, and, the, standing, of, yeshivot, weakened, the, leadership, void, was, gradually, filled, by, the, jewish, center, in, babylonia, which, would, assume, a, leading, role, in, the, jewish, world, for, generations, after, the, byzantine, period, during, the, 5th, and, 6th, centuries, ce, the, region, witnessed, a, series, of, samaritan, revolts, against, byzantine, rule, their, suppression, resulted, in, the, decline, of, samaritan, presence, and, influence, and, further, consolidated, christian, domination, though, it, is, acknowledged, that, some, jews, and, samaritans, converted, to, christianity, during, the, byzantine, period, the, reliable, historical, records, are, limited, and, they, pertain, to, individual, conversions, rather, than, entire, communities, in, 611, khosrow, ii, ruler, of, sassanid, persia, invaded, the, byzantine, empire, he, was, helped, by, jewish, fighters, recruited, by, benjamin, of, tiberias,

made, governor, of, jerusalem, christian, historians, of, the, period, claimed, the, jews, massacred, christians, in, the, city, but, there, is, no, archeological, evidence, of, destruction, leading, modern, historians, to, question, their, accounts, in, 628, kavad, ii, son, of, kosrow, returned, palestine, and, the, true, cross, to, the, byzantines, and, signed, a, peace, treaty, with, them, following, the, byzantine, re, entry, heraclius, massacred, the, jewish, population, of, galilee, and, jerusalem, while, renewing, the, ban, on, jews, entering, the, latter, the, levant, was,

located, a, second, building, the, al, aqsa, mosque, was, also, erected, on, the, temple, mount, in, 705, both, buildings, were, rebuilt, in, the, 10th, century, following, a, series, of, earthquakes, in, 750, arab, discrimination, against, non, arab, muslims, led, to, the, abbasid, revolution, and, the, umayyads, were, replaced, by, the, abbasid, caliphs, who, built, a, new, city, baghdad, to, be, their, capital, this, period, is, known, as, the, islamic, golden, age, the, arab, empire, was, the, largest, in, the, world, and, baghdad, the, largest, and, richest, city, both, arabs, and, minorities, prospered, across, the, region, and, much, scientific, progress, was, made, there, were, however, setbacks, during, the, 8th, century, the, caliph, umar, ii, introduced, a, law, requiring, jews, and, christians, to, wear, identifying, clothing, jews, were, required, to, wear, yellow, stars, round, their, neck, and, on, their, hats, christians, had, to, wear, blue, clothing, regulations, arose, during, repressive, periods, of, arab, rule, and, were, more, designed, to, humiliate, then, persecute, non, muslims, a, poll, tax, was, imposed, on, all, non, muslims, by, islamic, rulers, and, failure, to, pay, could, result, in, imprisonment, or, worse, in, 982, caliph, al, aziz, billah, of, the, cairo, based, fatimid, dynasty, conquered, the, region, the, fatimids, were, followers, of, isma, ilism, a, branch, of, shia, islam, and, claimed, descent, from, fatima, mohammed, s, daughter, around, the, year, 1010, the, church, of, holy, sepulchre, believed, to, be, jesus, burial, site, was, destroyed, by, fatimid, caliph, al, hakim, who, relented, ten, years, later, and, paid, for, it, to, be, rebuilt, in, 1020, al, hakim, claimed, divine, status, and, the, newly, formed, druze, religion, gave, him, the, status, of, a, messiah, although, the, arab, conquest, was, relatively, peaceful, and, did, not, cause, widespread, destruction, it, did, alter, the, country, s, demographics, significantly, over, the, ensuing, several, centuries, the, region, experienced, a, drastic, decline, in, its, population, from, an, estimated, 1, million, during, roman, and, byzantine, times, to, some, 300, 000, by, the, early, ottoman, period, this, demographic, collapse, was, accompanied, by, a, slow, process, of, islamization, that, resulted, from, the, flight, of, non, muslim, populations, immigration, of, muslims, and, local, conversion, the, majority, of, the, remaining, populace, belonged, to, the, lowest, classes, while, the, arab, conquerors, themselves, left, the, area, after, the, conquest, and, moved, on, to, other, places, the, settlement, of, arab, tribes, in, the, area, both, before, and, after, the, conquest, also, contributed, to, the, islamization, as, a, result, the, muslim, population, steadily, grew, and, the, area, became, gradually, dominated, by, muslims, on, a, political, and, social, level, during, the, early, islamic, period, many, christians, and, samaritans, belonging, to, the, byzantine, upper, class, migrated, from, the, coastal, cities, to, northern, syria, and, cyprus, which, were, still, under, byzantine, control, while, others, fled, to, the, central, highlands, and, the, transjordan, as, a, result, the, coastal, towns, formerly, important, economic, centers, connected, with, the, rest, of, the, byzantine, world, were, emptied, of, most, of, their, residents, some, of, these, cities, namely, ashkelon, acre, arsuf, and, gaza, now, fortified, border, towns, were, resettled, by, muslim, populations, who, developed, them, into, significant, muslim, centers, the, region, of, samaria, also, underwent, a, process, of, islamization, as, a, result, of, waves, of, conversion, among, the, samaritan, population, and, the, influx, of, muslims, into, the, area, the, predominantly, jacobite, monophysitic, christian, population, had, been, hostile, to, byzantium, orthodoxy, and, at, times, for, that, reason, welcomed, muslim, rule, there, is, no, strong, evidence, for, forced, conversion, or, for, possibility, that, the, jizya, tax, significantly, affected, such, changes, the, demographic, situation, in, palestine, was, further, altered, by, urban, decline, under, the, abbasids, and, it, is, thought, that, the, 749, earthquake, hastened, this, process, by, causing, an, increase, in, the, number, of, jews, christians, and, samaritans, who, emigrated, to, diaspora, communities, while, also, leaving, behind, others, who, remained, in, the, devastated, cities, and, poor, villages, until, they, converted, to, islam, historical, records, and, archeological, evidence, suggest, that, many, samaritans, converted, under, abbasid, and, tulunid, rule, after, suffering, through, severe, difficulties, such, droughts, earthquakes, religious, persecution, heavy, taxes, and, anarchy, the, same, region, also, saw, the, settlement, of, arabs, over, the, period, the, samaritan, population, drastically, decreased, with, the, rural, samaritan, population, converting, to, islam, and, small, urban, communities, remaining, in, nablus, and, caesarea, as, well, as, in, cairo, damascus, aleppo, and, sarepta, nevertheless, the, muslim, population, remained, a, minority, in, a, predominantly, christian, area, and, it, is, likely, that, this, status, persisted, until, the, crusader, period, in, 1095, pope, urban, ii, called, upon, christians, to, wage, a, holy, war, and, recapture, jerusalem, from, muslim, rule, responding, to, this, call, christians, launched, the, first, crusade, in, the, same, year, a, military, campaign, aimed, at, retaking, the, holy, land, ultimately, resulting, in, the, successful, siege, and, conquest, of, jerusalem, in, 1099, in, the, same, year, the, crusaders, conquered, beit, she, an, and, tiberias, and, in, the, following, decade, they, captured, coastal, cities, with, the, support, of, italian, city, state, fleets, establishing, these, coastal, ports, as, crucial, strongholds, for, crusader, rule, in, the, region, following, the, first, crusade, several, crusader, states, were, established, in, the, levant, with, the, kingdom, of, jerusalem, regnum, hierosolymitanum, assuming, a, preeminent, position, and, enjoying, special, status, among, them, the, population, consisted, predominantly, of, muslims, christians, jews, and, samaritans, while, the, crusaders, remained, a, minority, and, relied, on, the, local, population, who, worked, the, soil, the, region, saw, the, construction, of, numerous, robust, castles, and, fortresses, yet, efforts, to, establish, permanent, european, villages, proved, unsuccessful, around, 1180, raynald, of, ch, tillon, ruler, of, transjordan, caused, increasing, conflict, with, the, ayyubid, sultan, saladin, salah, al, din, leading, to, the, defeat, of, the, crusaders, in, the, 1187, battle, of, hattin, above, tiberias, saladin, was, able, to, peacefully, take, jerusalem, and, conquered, most, of, the, former, kingdom, of, jerusalem, saladin, s, court, physician, was, maimonides, a, refugee, from, almohad, muslim, persecution, in, c, rdoba, spain, where, all, non, muslim, religions, had, been, banned, the, christian, world, s, response, to, the, loss, of, jerusalem, came, in, the, third, crusade, of, 1190, after, lengthy, battles, and, negotiations, richard, the, lionheart, and, saladin, concluded, the, treaty, of, jaffa, in, 1192, whereby, christians, were, granted, free, passage, to, make, pilgrimages, to, the, holy, sites, while, jerusalem, remained, under, muslim, rule, in, 1229, jerusalem, peacefully, reverted, into, christian, control, as, part, of, a, treaty, between, holy, roman, emperor, frederick, ii, and, ayyubid, sultan, al, kamil, that, ended, the, sixth, crusade, in, 1244, jerusalem, was, sacked, by, the, khwarezmian, tatars, who, decimated, the, city, s, christian, population, drove, out, the, jews, and, razed, the, city, the, khwarezmians, were,

impoverished, the, country, and, severely, reduced, the, population, in, egypt, a, caste, of, warrior, slaves, known, as, the, mamluks, gradually, took, control, of, the, kingdom, the, mamluks, were, mostly, of, turkish, origin, and, were, bought, as, children, and, then, trained, in, warfare, they, were, highly, prized, warriors, who, gave, rulers, independence, of, the, native, aristocracy, in, egypt, they, took, control, of, the, kingdom, following, a, failed, invasion, by, the, crusaders, seventh, crusade, the, first, mamluk, sultan, qutuz, of, egypt, defeated, the, mongols, in, the, battle, of, ain, jalut, goliath, s, spring, near, ein, harod, ending, the, mongol, advances, he, was, assassinated, by, one, of, his, generals, baibars, who, went, on, to, eliminate, most, of, the, crusader, outposts, the, mamluks, ruled, palestine, until, 1516, regarding, it, as, part, of, syria, in, hebron, jews, were, banned, from, worshipping, at, the, cave, of, the, patriarchs, the, second, holiest, site, in, judaism, they, were, only, allowed, to, enter, 7, steps, inside, the, site, and, the, ban, remained, in, place, until, israel, assumed, control, of, the, west, bank, in, the, six, days, war, the, egyptian, mamluk, sultan, al, ashraf, khalil, conquered, the, last, outpost, of, crusader, rule, in, 1291, the, mamluks, continuing, the, policy, of, the, ayyubids, made, the, strategic, decision, to, destroy, the, coastal, area, and, to, bring, desolation, to, many, of, its, cities, from, tyre, in, the, north, to, gaza, in, the, south, ports, were, destroyed, and, various, materials, were, dumped, to, make, them, inoperable, the, goal, was, to, prevent, attacks, from, the, sea, given, the, fear, of, the, return, of, the, crusaders, this, had, a, long, term, effect, on, those, areas, which, remained, sparsely, populated, for, centuries, the, activity, in, that, time, concentrated, more, inland, with, the, 1492, expulsion, of, jews, from, spain, and, 1497, persecution, of, jews, and, muslims, by, manuel, i, of, portugal, many, jews, moved, eastward, with, some, deciding, to, settle, in, the, mamluk, palestine, as, a, consequence, the, local, jewish, community, underwent, significant, rejuvenation, the, influx, of, sephardic, jews, began, under, mamluk, rule, in, the, 15th, century, and, continued, throughout, the, 16th, century, and, especially, after, the, ottoman, conquest, as, city, dwellers, the, majority, of, sephardic, jews, preferred, to, settle, in, urban, areas, mainly, in, safed, but, also, in, jerusalem, while, the, musta, arbi, community, comprised, the, majority, of, the, villagers, jews, under, the, mamluks, the, area, was, a, province, of, bilad, a, sham, syria, it, was, conquered, by, turkish, sultan, selim, i, in, 1516,
