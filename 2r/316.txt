https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Hastings
the, battle, of, hastings, was, fought, on, 14, october, 1066, between, the, norman, french, army, of, william, duke, of, normandy, and, an, english, army, under, the, anglo, saxon, king, harold, godwinson, beginning, the, norman, conquest, of, england, it, took, place, approximately, 7, mi, 11, km, northwest, of, hastings, close, to, the, present, day, town, of, battle, east, sussex, and, was, a, decisive, norman, victory, the, background, to, the, battle, was, the, death, of, the, childless, king, edward, the, confessor, in, january, 1066, which, set, up, a, succession, struggle, between, several, claimants, to, his, throne, harold, was, crowned, king, shortly, after, edward, s, death, but, faced, invasions, by, william, his, own, brother, tostig, and, the, norwegian, king, harald, hardrada, harold, iii, of, norway, hardrada, and, tostig, defeated, a, hastily, gathered, army, of, englishmen, at, the, battle, of, fulford, on, 20, september, 1066, and, were, in, turn, defeated, by, harold, at, the, battle, of, stamford, bridge, five, days, later, the, deaths, of, tostig, and, hardrada, at, stamford, bridge, left, william, as, harold, s, only, serious, opponent, while, harold, and, his, forces, were, recovering, william, landed, his, invasion, forces, in, the, south, of, england, at, pevensey, on, 28, september, 1066, and, established, a, beachhead, for, his, conquest, of, the, kingdom, harold, was, forced, to, march, south, swiftly, gathering, forces, as, he, went, the, exact, numbers, present, at, the, battle, are, unknown, as, even, modern, estimates, vary, considerably, the, composition, of, the, forces, is, clearer, the, english, army, was, composed, almost, entirely, of, infantry, and, had, few, archers, whereas, only, about, half, of, the, invading, force, was, infantry, the, rest, split, equally, between, cavalry, and, archers, harold, appears, to, have, tried, to, surprise, william, but, scouts, found, his, army, and, reported, its, arrival, to, william, who, marched, from, hastings, to, the, battlefield, to, confront, harold, the, battle, lasted, from, about, 9, am, to, dusk, early, efforts, of, the, invaders, to, break, the, english, battle, lines, had, little, effect, therefore, the, normans, adopted, the, tactic, of, pretending, to, flee, in, panic, and, then, turning, on, their, pursuers, harold, s, death, probably, near, the, end, of, the, battle, led, to, the, retreat, and, defeat, of, most, of, his, army, after, further, marching, and, some, skirmishes, william, was, crowned, as, king, on, christmas, day, 1066, there, continued, to, be, rebellions, and, resistance, to, william, s, rule, but, hastings, effectively, marked, the, culmination, of, william, s, conquest, of, england, casualty, figures, are, hard, to, come, by, but, some, historians, estimate, that, 2, 000, invaders, died, along, with, about, twice, that, number, of, englishmen, william, founded, a, monastery, at, the, site, of, the, battle, the, high, altar, of, the, abbey, church, supposedly, placed, at, the, spot, where, harold, died, in, 911, the, carolingian, ruler, charles, the, simple, allowed, a, group, of, vikings, to, settle, in, normandy, under, their, leader, rollo, their, settlement, proved, successful, and, they, quickly, adapted, to, the, indigenous, culture, renouncing, paganism, converting, to, christianity, and, intermarrying, with, the, local, population, over, time, the, frontiers, of, the, duchy, expanded, to, the, west, in, 1002, king, thelred, ii, married, emma, the, sister, of, richard, ii, duke, of, normandy, their, son, edward, the, confessor, spent, many, years, in, exile, in, normandy, and, succeeded, to, the, english, throne, in, 1042, this, led, to, the, establishment, of, a, powerful, norman, interest, in, english, politics, as, edward, drew, heavily, on, his, former, hosts, for, support, bringing, in, norman, courtiers, soldiers, and, clerics, and, appointing, them, to, positions, of, power, particularly, in, the, church, edward, was, childless, and, embroiled, in, conflict, with, the, formidable, godwin, earl, of, wessex, and, his, sons, and, he, may, also, have, encouraged, duke, william, of, normandy, s, ambitions, for, the, english, throne, king, edward, s, death, on, 5, january, 1066, left, no, clear, heir, and, several, contenders, laid, claim, to, the, throne, of, england, edward, s, immediate, successor, was, the, earl, of, wessex, harold, godwinson, the, richest, and, most, powerful, of, the, english, aristocrats, and, son, of, godwin, edward, s, earlier, opponent, harold, was, elected, king, by, the, witenagemot, of, england, and, crowned, by, ealdred, the, archbishop, of, york, although, norman, propaganda, claimed, that, the, ceremony, was, performed, by, stigand, the, uncanonically, elected, archbishop, of, canterbury, harold, was, at, once, challenged, by, two, powerful, neighbouring, rulers, duke, william, claimed, that, he, had, been, promised, the, throne, by, king, edward, and, that, harold, had, sworn, agreement, to, this, harald, hardrada, of, norway, also, contested, the, succession, his, claim, to, the, throne, was, based, on, an, agreement, between, his, predecessor, magnus, the, good, and, the, earlier, king, of, england, harthacnut, whereby, if, either, died, without, heir, the, other, would, inherit, both, england, and, norway, william, and, harald, hardrada, immediately, set, about, assembling, troops, and, ships, for, separate, invasions, in, early, 1066, harold, s, exiled, brother, tostig, godwinson, raided, southeastern, england, with, a, fleet, he, had, recruited, in, flanders, later, joined, by, other, ships, from, orkney, threatened, by, harold, s, fleet, tostig, moved, north, and, raided, in, east, anglia, and, lincolnshire, he, was, driven, back, to, his, ships, by, the, brothers, edwin, earl, of, mercia, and, morcar, earl, of, northumbria, deserted, by, most, of, his, followers, he, withdrew, to, scotland, where, he, spent, the, middle, of, the, year, recruiting, fresh, forces, hardrada, invaded, northern, england, in, early, september, leading, a, fleet, of, more, than, 300, ships, carrying, perhaps, 15, 000, men, hardrada, s, army, was, further, augmented, by, the, forces, of, tostig, who, supported, the, norwegian, king, s, bid, for, the, throne, advancing, on, york, the, norwegians, occupied, the, city, after, defeating, a, northern, english, army, under, edwin, and, morcar, on, 20, september, at, the, battle, of, fulford, the, english, army, was, organised, along, regional, lines, with, the, fyrd, or, local, levy, serving, under, a, local, magnate, whether, an, earl, bishop, or, sheriff, the, fyrd, was, composed, of, men, who, owned, their, own, land, and, were, equipped, by, their, community, to, fulfil, the, king, s, demands, for, military, forces, for, every, five, hides, or, units, of, land, nominally, capable, of, supporting, one, household, one, man, was, supposed, to, serve, it, appears, that, the, hundred, was, the, main, organising, unit, for, the, fyrd, as, a, whole, england, could, furnish, about, 14, 000, men, for, the, fyrd, when, it, was, called, out, the, fyrd, usually, served, for, two, months, except, in, emergencies, it, was, rare, for, the, whole, national, fyrd, to, be, called, out, between, 1046, and, 1065, it, was, only, done, three, times, in, 1051, 1052, and, 1065, the, king, also, had, a, group, of, personal, armsmen, known, as, housecarls, who, formed, the, backbone, of, the, royal, forces, some, earls, also, had, their, own, forces, of, housecarls, thegns, the, local, landowning, elites, either, fought, with, the, royal, housecarls, or, attached, themselves, to, the, forces, of, an, earl, or, other, magnate, the, fyrd, and, the, housecarls, both, fought, on, foot, with, the, major, difference, between, them, being, the, housecarls, superior, armour, the, english, army, does, not, appear, to, have, had, a, significant, number, of, archers, harold, had, spent, mid, 1066, on, the, south, coast, with, a, large, army, and, fleet, waiting, for, william, to, invade, the, bulk, of, his, forces, were, militia, who, needed, to, harvest, their, crops, so, on, 8, september, harold, dismissed, the, militia, and, the, fleet, learning, of, the, norwegian, invasion, he, rushed, north, gathering, forces, as, he, went, and, took, the, norwegians, by, surprise, defeating, them, at, the, battle, of, stamford, bridge, on, 25, september, harald, hardrada, and, tostig, were, killed, and, the, norwegians, suffered, such, great, losses, that, only, 24, of, the, original, 300, ships, were, required, to, carry, away, the, survivors, the, english, victory, came, at, great, cost, as, harold, s, army, was, left, in, a, battered, and, weakened, state, and, far, from, the, south, william, assembled, a, large, invasion, fleet, and, an, army, gathered, from, normandy, and, the, rest, of, france, including, large, contingents, from, brittany, and, flanders, he, spent, almost, nine, months, on, his, preparations, as, he, had, to, construct, a, fleet, from, nothing, according, to, some, norman, chronicles, he, also, secured, diplomatic, support, although, the, accuracy, of, the, reports, has, been, a, matter, of, historical, debate, the, most, famous, claim, is, that, pope, alexander, ii, gave, a, papal, banner, as, a, token, of, support, which, only, appears, in, william, of, poitiers, s, account, and, not, in, more, contemporary, narratives, in, april, 1066, halley, s, comet, appeared, in, the, sky, and, was, widely, reported, throughout, europe, contemporary, accounts, connected, the, comet, s, appearance, with, the, succession, crisis, in, england, william, mustered, his, forces, at, saint, valery, sur, somme, and, was, ready, to, cross, the, english, channel, by, about, 12, august, but, the, crossing, was, delayed, either, because, of, unfavourable, weather, or, to, avoid, being, intercepted, by, the, powerful, english, fleet, the, normans, crossed, to, england, a, few, days, after, harold, s, victory, over, the, norwegians, following, the, dispersal, of, harold, s, naval, force, and, landed, at, pevensey, in, sussex, on, 28, september, a, few, ships, were, blown, off, course, and, landed, at, romney, where, the, normans, fought, the, local, fyrd, after, landing, william, s, forces, built, a, wooden, castle, at, hastings, from, which, they, raided, the, surrounding, area, more, fortifications, were, erected, at, pevensey, the, exact, numbers, and, composition, of, william, s, force, are, unknown, a, contemporary, document, claims, that, william, had, 776, ships, but, this, may, be, an, inflated, figure, figures, given, by, contemporary, writers, for, the, size, of, the, army, are, highly, exaggerated, varying, from, 14, 000, to, 150, 000, modern, historians, have, offered, a, range, of, estimates, for, the, size, of, william, s, forces, 7, 000, 8, 000, men, including, 1, 000, 2, 000, cavalry, 10, 000, 12, 000, men, 10, 000, men, including, 3, 000, cavalry, or, 7, 500, men, the, army, consisted, of, about, one, half, infantry, one, quarter, cavalry, and, one, quarter, archers, or, crossbowmen, later, lists, of, companions, of, william, the, conqueror, are, extant, but, most, are, padded, with, extra, names, only, about, 35, named, individuals, can, be, reliably, identified, as, having, been, with, william, at, hastings, the, main, armour, was, chainmail, hauberks, usually, knee, length, with, slits, to, allow, riding, some, with, sleeves, to, the, elbows, some, hauberks, may, have, been, made, of, scales, attached, to, a, tunic, with, the, scales, made, of, metal, horn, or, hardened, leather, headgear, was, usually, a, conical, metal, helmet, with, a, vertical, band, guarding, the, bridge, of, the, nose, horsemen, and, infantry, carried, shields, the, infantryman, s, shield, was, usually, round, and, made, of, wood, with, metal, reinforcement, horsemen, changed, to, a, kite, shaped, shield, and, were, usually, armed, with, a, lance, the, couched, lance, carried, tucked, against, the, body, under, the, right, arm, was, relatively, new, and, probably, not, used, at, hastings, as, the, terrain, was, unfavourable, for, long, cavalry, charges, both, infantry, and, cavalry, usually, fought, with, a, straight, sword, long, and, double, edged, the, infantry, could, also, use, javelins, and, long, spears, some, of, the, cavalry, may, have, used, a, mace, instead, of, a, sword, archers, would, have, used, a, self, bow, or, a, crossbow, and, most, would, not, have, had, armour, after, defeating, his, brother, tostig, and, harald, hardrada, in, the, north, harold, left, much, of, his, forces, in, the, north, including, morcar, and, edwin, and, marched, the, rest, of, his, army, south, to, deal, with, the, threatened, norman, invasion, it, is, unclear, when, harold, learned, of, william, s, landing, but, it, was, probably, during, the, march, harold, stopped, in, london, for, about, a, week, before, hastings, so, it, is, likely, that, he, spent, about, a, week, on, his, march, south, averaging, about, 27, mi, 43, km, per, day, for, the, approximately, 200, mi, 320, km, harold, camped, at, caldbec, hill, on, the, night, of, 13, october, near, a, hoar, apple, tree, about, 8, mi, 13, km, from, william, s, castle, at, hastings, some, of, the, early, contemporary, french, accounts, mention, an, emissary, or, emissaries, sent, by, harold, to, william, which, is, likely, though, nothing, came, of, it, although, harold, attempted, to, surprise, the, normans, william, s, scouts, reported, the, english, arrival, to, the, duke, the, exact, events, preceding, the, battle, are, obscure, with, contradictory, accounts, in, the, sources, but, all, agree, that, william, s, army, advanced, from, his, castle, towards, the, enemy, harold, had, taken, a, defensive, position, at, the, top, of, senlac, hill, present, day, battle, east, sussex, about, 6, mi, 9, 7, km, from, william, s, castle, at, hastings, the, exact, number, of, soldiers, in, harold, s, army, at, hastings, is, unknown, as, contemporary, records, do, not, give, reliable, figures, some, norman, sources, give, 400, 000, to, 1, 200, 000, on, harold, s, side, while, english, sources, seem, to, underestimate, harold, s, army, perhaps, to, make, the, english, defeat, seem, less, devastating, recent, historians, have, suggested, figures, of, between, 5, 000, and, 13, 000, while, most, argue, for, a, figure, of, 7, 000, 8, 000, english, troops, these, men, would, have, been, a, mix, of, the, fyrd, and, housecarls, few, individual, englishmen, are, known, to, have, been, present, about, 20, named, individuals, can, reasonably, be, assumed, to, have, fought, with, harold, at, hastings, including, harold, s, brothers, gyrth, and, leofwine, and, two, other, relatives, the, english, army, consisted, entirely, of, infantry, it, is, possible, that, some, of, the, higher, class, members, of, the, army, rode, to, battle, but, then, dismounted, when, battle, was, joined, to, fight, on, foot, the, core, of, the, army, was, made, up, of, housecarls, full, time, professional, soldiers, their, armour, consisted, of, a, conical, helmet, a, mail, hauberk, and, a, shield, which, might, be, either, kite, shaped, or, round, most, housecarls, fought, with, the, two, handed, danish, battleaxe, but, they, could, also, carry, a, sword, the, rest, of, the, army, was, made, up, of, levies, from, the, fyrd, also, infantry, but, more, lightly, armoured, and, not, professionals, most, of, the, infantry, would, have, formed, part, of, the, shield, wall, in, which, the, front, ranks, locked, their, shields, together, behind, them, would, have, been, axemen, and, javelins, as, well, as, archers, because, many, of, the, primary, accounts, contradict, each, other, at, times, it, is, impossible, to, provide, an, authoritative, description, of, the, battle, the, only, undisputed, facts, are, that, fighting, began, at, 9, am, saturday, 14, october, 1066, and, that, the, battle, lasted, until, dusk, sunset, on, the, day, of, the, battle, was, at, 4, 54, pm, with, the, battlefield, mostly, dark, by, 5, 54, pm, and, in, full, darkness, by, 6, 24, pm, moonrise, that, night, was, not, until, 11, 12, pm, so, once, the, sun, set, there, was, little, light, on, the, battlefield, william, of, jumi, ges, reports, that, duke, william, kept, his, army, armed, and, ready, against, a, surprise, attack, for, the, entire, night, before, the, battle, took, place, 7, mi, 11, km, north, of, hastings, at, the, present, day, town, of, battle, between, two, hills, caldbec, hill, to, the, north, and, telham, hill, to, the, south, the, area, was, heavily, wooded, with, a, marsh, nearby, the, name, traditionally, given, to, the, battle, is, unusual, there, were, several, settlements, much, closer, to, the, battlefield, than, hastings, the, anglo, saxon, chronicle, called, it, the, battle, at, the, hoary, apple, tree, within, 40, years, the, battle, was, described, by, the, anglo, norman, chronicler, orderic, vitalis, as, senlac, a, norman, french, adaptation, of, the, old, english, word, sandlacu, which, means, sandy, water, this, may, have, been, the, name, of, the, stream, that, crosses, the, battlefield, the, battle, was, already, being, referred, to, as, bellum, haestingas, or, battle, of, hastings, by, 1086, in, the, domesday, book, the, sun, rose, at, 6, 48, am, that, morning, with, the, day, unusually, bright, the, weather, conditions, are, not, recorded, the, precise, route, of, the, english, army, southward, to, the, battlefield, is, not, known, several, roads, are, possible, one, an, old, roman, road, that, ran, from, rochester, to, hastings, has, long, been, favoured, because, of, a, large, coin, hoard, found, nearby, in, 1876, another, possibility, is, the, roman, road, between, london, and, lewes, and, then, over, local, tracks, to, the, battlefield, some, accounts, of, the, battle, indicate, that, the, normans, advanced, from, hastings, to, the, battlefield, but, the, contemporary, account, of, william, of, jumi, ges, places, the, normans, at, the, site, of, the, battle, the, night, before, most, historians, incline, towards, the, former, view, but, m, k, lawson, argues, that, william, of, jumi, ges, s, account, is, correct, harold, s, forces, deployed, in, a, small, dense, formation, at, the, top, of, a, steep, slope, with, their, flanks, protected, by, woods, and, marshy, ground, in, front, of, them, the, line, may, have, extended, far, enough, to, be, anchored, on, a, nearby, stream, the, english, formed, a, shield, wall, with, the, front, ranks, holding, their, shields, close, together, or, even, overlapping, to, provide, protection, from, attack, sources, differ, on, the, exact, site, that, the, english, fought, on, some, sources, state, the, site, of, the, abbey, but, some, newer, sources, suggest, it, was, caldbec, hill, more, is, known, about, the, norman, deployment, duke, william, appears, to, have, arranged, his, forces, in, three, groups, or, battles, which, roughly, corresponded, to, their, origins, the, left, units, were, the, bretons, along, with, those, from, anjou, poitou, and, maine, this, division, was, led, by, alan, the, red, a, relative, of, the, breton, count, the, centre, was, held, by, the, normans, under, the, direct, command, of, the, duke, and, with, many, of, his, relatives, and, kinsmen, grouped, around, the, ducal, party, the, final, division, on, the, right, consisted, of, the, frenchmen, along, with, some, men, from, picardy, boulogne, and, flanders, the, right, was, commanded, by, william, fitzosbern, and, count, eustace, ii, of, boulogne, the, front, lines, were, made, up, of, archers, with, a, line, of, foot, soldiers, armed, with, spears, behind, there, were, probably, a, few, crossbowmen, and, slingers, in, with, the, archers, the, cavalry, was, held, in, reserve, and, a, small, group, of, clergymen, and, servants, situated, at, the, base, of, telham, hill, was, not, expected, to, take, part, in, the, fighting, william, s, disposition, of, his, forces, implies, that, he, planned, to, open, the, battle, with, archers, in, the, front, rank, weakening, the, enemy, with, arrows, followed, by, infantry, who, would, engage, in, close, combat, the, infantry, would, create, openings, in, the, english, lines, that, could, be, exploited, by, a, cavalry, charge, to, break, through, the, english, forces, and, pursue, the, fleeing, soldiers, the, battle, opened, with, the, norman, archers, shooting, uphill, at, the, english, shield, wall, to, little, effect, the, uphill, angle, meant, that, the, arrows, either, bounced, off, the, shields, of, the, english, or, overshot, their, targets, and, flew, over, the, top, of, the, hill, the, lack, of, english, archers, hampered, the, norman, archers, as, there, were, few, english, arrows, to, be, gathered, up, and, reused, after, the, attack, from, the, archers, william, sent, the, spearmen, forward, to, attack, the, english, they, were, met, with, a, barrage, of, missiles, not, arrows, but, spears, axes, and, stones, the, infantry, was, unable, to, force, openings, in, the, shield, wall, and, the, cavalry, advanced, in, support, the, cavalry, also, failed, to, make, headway, and, a, general, retreat, began, blamed, on, the, breton, division, on, william, s, left, a, rumour, started, that, the, duke, had, been, killed, which, added, to, the, confusion, the, english, forces, began, to, pursue, the, fleeing, invaders, but, william, rode, through, his, forces, showing, his, face, and, yelling, that, he, was, still, alive, the, duke, then, led, a, counter, attack, against, the, pursuing, english, forces, some, of, the, english, rallied, on, a, hillock, before, being, overwhelmed, it, is, not, known, whether, the, english, pursuit, was, ordered, by, harold, or, if, it, was, spontaneous, wace, relates, that, harold, ordered, his, men, to, stay, in, their, formations, but, no, other, account, gives, this, detail, the, bayeux, tapestry, depicts, the, death, of, harold, s, brothers, gyrth, and, leofwine, occurring, just, before, the, fight, around, the, hillock, this, may, mean, that, the, two, brothers, led, the, pursuit, the, carmen, de, hastingae, proelio, relates, a, different, story, for, the, death, of, gyrth, stating, that, the, duke, slew, harold, s, brother, in, combat, perhaps, thinking, that, gyrth, was, harold, william, of, poitiers, states, that, the, bodies, of, gyrth, and, leofwine, were, found, near, harold, s, implying, that, they, died, late, in, the, battle, it, is, possible, that, if, the, two, brothers, died, early, in, the, fighting, their, bodies, were, taken, to, harold, thus, accounting, for, their, being, found, near, his, body, after, the, battle, the, military, historian, peter, marren, speculates, that, if, gyrth, and, leofwine, died, early, in, the, battle, that, may, have, influenced, harold, to, stand, and, fight, to, the, end, a, lull, probably, occurred, early, in, the, afternoon, and, a, break, for, rest, and, food, would, probably, have, been, needed, william, may, have, also, needed, time, to, implement, a, new, strategy, which, may, have, been, inspired, by, the, english, pursuit, and, subsequent, rout, by, the, normans, if, the, normans, could, send, their, cavalry, against, the, shield, wall, and, then, draw, the, english, into, more, pursuits, breaks, in, the, english, line, might, form, william, of, poitiers, says, the, tactic, was, used, twice, although, arguments, have, been, made, that, the, chroniclers, accounts, of, this, tactic, were, meant, to, excuse, the, flight, of, the, norman, troops, from, battle, this, is, unlikely, as, the, earlier, flight, was, not, glossed, over, it, was, a, tactic, used, by, other, norman, armies, during, the, period, some, historians, have, argued, that, the, story, of, the, use, of, feigned, flight, as, a, deliberate, tactic, was, invented, after, the, battle, however, most, historians, agree, that, it, was, used, by, the, normans, at, hastings, although, the, feigned, flights, did, not, break, the, lines, they, probably, thinned, out, the, housecarls, in, the, english, shield, wall, the, housecarls, were, replaced, with, members, of, the, fyrd, and, the, shield, wall, held, archers, appear, to, have, been, used, again, before, and, during, an, assault, by, the, cavalry, and, infantry, led, by, the, duke, although, 12th, century, sources, state, that, the, archers, were, ordered, to, shoot, at, a, high, angle, to, shoot, over, the, front, of, the, shield, wall, there, is, no, trace, of, such, an, action, in, the, more, contemporary, accounts, it, is, not, known, how, many, assaults, were, launched, against, the, english, lines, but, some, sources, record, various, actions, by, both, normans, and, englishmen, that, took, place, during, the, afternoon, s, fighting, the, carmen, claims, that, duke, william, had, two, horses, killed, under, him, during, the, fighting, but, william, of, poitiers, s, account, states, that, it, was, three, harold, appears, to, have, died, late, in, the, battle, although, accounts, in, the, various, sources, are, contradictory, william, of, poitiers, only, mentions, his, death, without, giving, any, details, on, how, it, occurred, the, tapestry, is, not, helpful, as, it, shows, a, figure, holding, an, arrow, sticking, out, of, his, eye, next, to, a, falling, fighter, being, hit, with, a, sword, over, both, figures, is, a, statement, here, king, harold, has, been, killed, it, is, not, clear, which, figure, is, meant, to, be, harold, or, if, both, are, meant, the, earliest, written, mention, of, the, traditional, account, of, harold, dying, from, an, arrow, to, the, eye, dates, to, the, 1080s, from, a, history, of, the, normans, written, by, an, italian, monk, amatus, of, montecassino, william, of, malmesbury, stated, that, harold, died, from, an, arrow, to, the, eye, that, went, into, the, brain, and, that, a, knight, wounded, harold, at, the, same, time, wace, repeats, the, arrow, to, the, eye, account, the, carmen, states, that, duke, william, killed, harold, but, this, is, unlikely, as, such, a, feat, would, have, been, recorded, elsewhere, the, account, of, william, of, jumi, ges, is, even, more, unlikely, as, it, has, harold, dying, in, the, morning, during, the, first, fighting, the, chronicle, of, battle, abbey, states, that, no, one, knew, who, killed, harold, as, it, happened, in, the, press, of, battle, a, modern, biographer, of, harold, ian, walker, states, that, harold, probably, died, from, an, arrow, in, the, eye, although, he, also, says, it, is, possible, that, harold, was, struck, down, by, a, norman, knight, while, mortally, wounded, in, the, eye, another, biographer, of, harold, peter, rex, after, discussing, the, various, accounts, concludes, that, it, is, not, possible, to, declare, how, harold, died, harold, s, death, left, the, english, forces, leaderless, and, they, began, to, collapse, many, of, them, fled, but, the, soldiers, of, the, royal, household, gathered, around, harold, s, body, and, fought, to, the, end, the, normans, began, to, pursue, the, fleeing, troops, and, except, for, a, rearguard, action, at, a, site, known, as, the, malfosse, the, battle, was, over, exactly, what, happened, at, the, malfosse, or, evil, ditch, and, where, it, took, place, is, unclear, it, occurred, at, a, small, fortification, or, set, of, trenches, where, some, englishmen, rallied, and, seriously, wounded, eustace, of, boulogne, before, being, defeated, by, the, normans, harold, s, defeat, was, probably, due, to, several, circumstances, one, was, the, need, to, defend, against, two, almost, simultaneous, invasions, the, fact, that, harold, had, dismissed, his, forces, in, southern, england, on, 8, september, also, contributed, to, the, defeat, many, historians, fault, harold, for, hurrying, south, and, not, gathering, more, forces, before, confronting, william, at, hastings, although, it, is, not, clear, that, the, english, forces, were, insufficient, to, deal, with, william, s, forces, against, these, arguments, for, an, exhausted, english, army, the, length, of, the, battle, which, lasted, an, entire, day, shows, that, the, english, forces, were, not, tired, by, their, long, march, tied, in, with, the, speed, of, harold, s, advance, to, hastings, is, the, possibility, harold, may, not, have, trusted, earls, edwin, of, mercia, and, morcar, of, northumbria, once, their, enemy, tostig, had, been, defeated, and, declined, to, bring, them, and, their, forces, south, modern, historians, have, pointed, out, that, one, reason, for, harold, s, rush, to, battle, was, to, contain, william, s, depredations, and, keep, him, from, breaking, free, of, his, beachhead, most, of, the, blame, for, the, defeat, probably, lies, in, the, events, of, the, battle, william, was, the, more, experienced, military, leader, and, in, addition, the, lack, of, cavalry, on, the, english, side, allowed, harold, fewer, tactical, options, some, writers, have, criticised, harold, for, not, exploiting, the, opportunity, offered, by, the, rumoured, death, of, william, early, in, the, battle, the, english, appear, to, have, erred, in, not, staying, strictly, on, the, defensive, for, when, they, pursued, the, retreating, normans, they, exposed, their, flanks, to, attack, whether, this, was, due, to, the, inexperience, of, the, english, commanders, or, the, indiscipline, of, the, english, soldiers, is, unclear, in, the, end, harold, s, death, appears, to, have, been, decisive, as, it, signalled, the, break, up, of, the, english, forces, in, disarray, the, historian, david, nicolle, said, of, the, battle, that, william, s, army, demonstrated, not, without, difficulty, the, superiority, of, norman, french, mixed, cavalry, and, infantry, tactics, over, the, germanic, scandinavian, infantry, traditions, of, the, anglo, saxons, the, day, after, the, battle, harold, s, body, was, identified, either, by, his, armour, or, by, marks, on, his, body, his, personal, standard, was, presented, to, william, and, later, sent, to, the, papacy, the, bodies, of, the, english, dead, including, some, of, harold, s, brothers, and, housecarls, were, left, on, the, battlefield, although, some, were, removed, by, relatives, later, the, norman, dead, were, buried, in, a, large, communal, grave, which, has, not, been, found, exact, casualty, figures, are, unknown, of, the, englishmen, known, to, be, at, the, battle, the, number, of, dead, implies, that, the, death, rate, was, about, 50, per, cent, of, those, engaged, although, this, may, be, too, high, of, the, named, normans, who, fought, at, hastings, one, in, seven, is, stated, to, have, died, but, these, were, all, noblemen, and, it, is, probable, that, the, death, rate, among, the, common, soldiers, was, higher, although, orderic, vitalis, s, figures, are, highly, exaggerated, his, ratio, of, one, in, four, casualties, may, be, accurate, marren, speculates, that, perhaps, 2, 000, normans, and, 4, 000, englishmen, were, killed, at, hastings, reports, stated, that, some, of, the, english, dead, were, still, being, found, on, the, hillside, years, later, although, scholars, thought, for, a, long, time, that, remains, would, not, be, recoverable, due, to, the, acidic, soil, recent, finds, have, changed, this, view, one, skeleton, that, was, found, in, a, medieval, cemetery, and, originally, was, thought, to, be, associated, with, the, 13th, century, battle, of, lewes, now, is, thought, to, be, associated, with, hastings, instead, one, story, relates, that, gytha, harold, s, mother, offered, the, victorious, duke, the, weight, of, her, son, s, body, in, gold, for, its, custody, but, was, refused, william, ordered, that, harold, s, body, be, thrown, into, the, sea, but, whether, that, took, place, is, unclear, another, story, relates, that, harold, was, buried, at, the, top, of, a, cliff, waltham, abbey, which, had, been, founded, by, harold, later, claimed, that, his, body, had, been, secretly, buried, there, other, legends, claimed, that, harold, did, not, die, at, hastings, but, escaped, and, became, a, hermit, at, chester, william, expected, to, receive, the, submission, of, the, surviving, english, leaders, after, his, victory, but, instead, edgar, the, theling, was, proclaimed, king, by, the, witenagemot, with, the, support, of, earls, edwin, and, morcar, stigand, the, archbishop, of, canterbury, and, ealdred, the, archbishop, of, york, william, therefore, advanced, on, london, marching, around, the, coast, of, kent, he, defeated, an, english, force, that, attacked, him, at, southwark, but, was, unable, to, storm, london, bridge, forcing, him, to, reach, the, capital, by, a, more, circuitous, route, william, moved, up, the, thames, valley, to, cross, the, river, at, wallingford, where, he, received, the, submission, of, stigand, he, then, travelled, north, east, along, the, chilterns, before, advancing, towards, london, from, the, north, west, fighting, further, engagements, against, forces, from, the, city, the, english, leaders, surrendered, to, william, at, berkhamsted, hertfordshire, william, was, acclaimed, king, of, england, and, crowned, by, ealdred, on, 25, december, 1066, in, westminster, abbey, despite, the, submission, of, the, english, nobles, resistance, continued, for, several, years, there, were, rebellions, in, exeter, in, late, 1067, an, invasion, by, harold, s, sons, in, mid, 1068, and, an, uprising, in, northumbria, in, 1068, in, 1069, william, faced, more, troubles, from, northumbrian, rebels, an, invading, danish, fleet, and, rebellions, in, the, south, and, west, of, england, he, ruthlessly, put, down, the, various, risings, culminating, in, the, harrying, of, the, north, in, late, 1069, and, early, 1070, that, devastated, parts, of, northern, england, a, further, rebellion, in, 1070, by, hereward, the, wake, was, also, defeated, by, the, king, at, ely, battle, abbey, was, founded, by, william, at, the, site, of, the, battle, according, to, 12th, century, sources, william, made, a, vow, to, found, the, abbey, and, the, high, altar, of, the, church, was, placed, at, the, site, where, harold, had, died, more, likely, the, foundation, was, imposed, on, william, by, papal, legates, in, 1070, the, topography, of, the, battlefield, has, been, altered, by, subsequent, construction, work, for, the, abbey, and, the, slope, defended, by, the, english, is, now, much, less, steep, than, it, was, at, the, time, of, the, battle, the, top, of, the, ridge, has, also, been, built, up, and, levelled, after, the, dissolution, of, the, monasteries, the, abbey, s, lands, passed, to, secular, landowners, who, used, it, as, a, residence, or, country, house, in, 1976, the, estate, was, put, up, for, sale, and, purchased, by, the, government, with, the, aid, of, some, american, donors, who, wished, to, honour, the, 200th, anniversary, of, american, independence, the, battlefield, and, abbey, grounds, are, currently, owned, and, administered, by, english, heritage, and, are, open, to, the, public, the, bayeux, tapestry, is, an, embroidered, narrative, of, the, events, leading, up, to, hastings, probably, commissioned, by, odo, of, bayeux, soon, after, the, battle, perhaps, to, hang, at, the, bishop, s, palace, at, bayeux, in, modern, times, annual, reenactments, of, the, battle, of, hastings, have, drawn, thousands, of, participants, and, spectators, to, the, site, of, the, original, battle, some, english, veterans, of, the, battle, left, england, and, joined, the, varangian, guard, in, constantinople, they, fought, the, normans, again, at, the, battle, of, dyrrhachium, in, 1081, and, were, defeated, again, in, similar, circumstances
