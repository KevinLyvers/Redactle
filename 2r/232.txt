the, sublime, ottoman, state, commonly, known, as, the, ottoman, empire, and, historically, and, colloquially, known, as, the, turkish, empire, was, an, empire, centred, in, anatolia, that, controlled, much, of, southeast, europe, west, asia, and, north, africa, from, the, 14th, to, early, 20th, centuries, it, also, controlled, parts, of, southeastern, central, europe, between, the, early, 16th, and, early, 18th, centuries, the, empire, emerged, from, a, beylik, or, principality, founded, in, northwestern, anatolia, in, 1299, by, the, turkoman, tribal, leader, osman, i, his, successors, conquered, much, of, anatolia, and, expanded, into, the, balkans, by, the, mid, 14th, century, transforming, their, petty, kingdom, into, a, transcontinental, empire, the, ottomans, ended, the, byzantine, empire, with, the, conquest, of, constantinople, in, 1453, by, mehmed, ii, which, marked, the, ottomans, emergence, as, a, major, regional, power, under, suleiman, the, magnificent, 1520, 1566, the, empire, reached, the, peak, of, its, power, prosperity, and, political, development, by, the, start, of, the, 17th, century, the, ottomans, presided, over, 32, provinces, and, numerous, vassal, states, which, over, time, were, either, absorbed, into, the, empire, or, granted, various, degrees, of, autonomy, with, its, capital, at, constantinople, modern, day, istanbul, and, control, over, a, significant, portion, of, the, mediterranean, basin, the, ottoman, empire, was, at, the, centre, of, interactions, between, the, middle, east, and, europe, for, six, centuries, while, the, ottoman, empire, was, once, thought, to, have, entered, a, period, of, decline, after, the, death, of, suleiman, the, magnificent, modern, academic, consensus, posits, that, the, empire, continued, to, maintain, a, flexible, and, strong, economy, society, and, military, into, much, of, the, 18th, century, however, during, a, long, period, of, peace, from, 1740, to, 1768, the, ottoman, military, system, fell, behind, those, of, its, chief, european, rivals, the, habsburg, and, russian, empires, the, ottomans, consequently, suffered, severe, military, defeats, in, the, late, 18th, and, early, 19th, centuries, culminating, in, the, loss, of, both, territory, and, global, prestige, this, prompted, a, comprehensive, process, of, reform, and, modernization, known, as, the, tanzimat, over, the, course, of, the, 19th, century, the, ottoman, state, became, vastly, more, powerful, and, organized, internally, despite, suffering, further, territorial, losses, especially, in, the, balkans, where, a, number, of, new, states, emerged, beginning, in, the, late, 19th, century, various, ottoman, intellectuals, sought, to, further, liberalize, society, and, politics, along, european, lines, culminating, in, the, young, turk, revolution, of, 1908, led, by, the, committee, of, union, and, progress, cup, which, established, the, second, constitutional, era, and, introduced, competitive, multi, party, elections, under, a, constitutional, monarchy, however, following, the, disastrous, balkan, wars, the, cup, became, increasingly, radicalized, and, nationalistic, leading, a, coup, d, tat, in, 1913, that, established, a, one, party, regime, the, cup, allied, with, the, german, empire, hoping, to, escape, from, the, diplomatic, isolation, that, had, contributed, to, its, recent, territorial, losses, it, thus, joined, world, war, i, on, the, side, of, the, central, powers, while, the, empire, was, able, to, largely, hold, its, own, during, the, conflict, it, struggled, with, internal, dissent, especially, the, arab, revolt, during, this, period, the, ottoman, government, engaged, in, genocide, against, armenians, assyrians, and, greeks, in, the, aftermath, of, world, war, i, the, victorious, allied, powers, occupied, and, partitioned, the, ottoman, empire, which, lost, its, southern, territories, to, the, united, kingdom, and, france, the, successful, turkish, war, of, independence, led, by, mustafa, kemal, atat, rk, against, the, occupying, allies, led, to, the, emergence, of, the, republic, of, turkey, in, the, anatolian, heartland, and, the, abolition, of, the, ottoman, monarchy, in, 1922, formally, ending, the, ottoman, empire, the, word, ottoman, is, a, historical, anglicisation, of, the, name, of, osman, i, the, founder, of, the, empire, and, of, the, ruling, house, of, osman, also, known, as, the, ottoman, dynasty, osman, s, name, in, turn, was, the, turkish, form, of, the, arabic, name, uthm, n, in, ottoman, turkish, the, empire, was, referred, to, as, devlet, i, al, ye, yi, o, s, m, n, ye, lit, sublime, ottoman, state, or, simply, devlet, i, o, s, m, n, ye, lit, ottoman, state, the, turkish, word, for, ottoman, osmanl, originally, referred, to, the, tribal, followers, of, osman, in, the, fourteenth, century, the, word, subsequently, came, to, be, used, to, refer, to, the, empire, s, military, administrative, elite, in, contrast, the, term, turk, t, rk, was, used, to, refer, to, the, anatolian, peasant, and, tribal, population, and, was, seen, as, a, disparaging, term, when, applied, to, urban, educated, individuals, in, the, early, modern, period, an, educated, urban, dwelling, turkish, speaker, who, was, not, a, member, of, the, military, administrative, class, typically, referred, to, themselves, neither, as, an, osmanl, nor, as, a, t, rk, but, rather, as, a, r, m, or, roman, meaning, an, inhabitant, of, the, territory, of, the, former, byzantine, empire, in, the, balkans, and, anatolia, the, term, r, m, was, also, used, to, refer, to, turkish, speakers, by, the, other, muslim, peoples, of, the, empire, and, beyond, as, applied, to, ottoman, turkish, speakers, this, term, began, to, fall, out, of, use, at, the, end, of, the, seventeenth, century, and, instead, the, word, increasingly, became, associated, with, the, greek, population, of, the, empire, a, meaning, that, it, still, bears, in, turkey, today, in, western, europe, the, names, ottoman, empire, turkish, empire, and, turkey, were, often, used, interchangeably, with, turkey, being, increasingly, favoured, both, in, formal, and, informal, situations, this, dichotomy, was, officially, ended, in, 1920, 1923, when, the, newly, established, ankara, based, turkish, government, chose, turkey, as, the, sole, official, name, according, to, svat, soucek, most, scholarly, historians, at, present, avoid, the, terms, turkey, turks, and, turkish, when, referring, to, the, ottomans, due, to, the, empire, s, multinational, character, the, ottoman, empire, was, founded, c, 1299, by, osman, i, as, a, small, beylik, in, northwestern, asia, minor, just, south, of, the, byzantine, capital, constantinople, in, 1326, the, ottomans, captured, nearby, bursa, cutting, off, asia, minor, from, byzantine, control, the, ottomans, first, crossed, into, europe, in, 1352, establishing, a, permanent, settlement, at, impe, castle, on, the, dardanelles, in, 1354, and, moving, their, capital, to, edirne, adrianople, in, 1369, at, the, same, time, the, numerous, small, turkic, states, in, asia, minor, were, assimilated, into, the, budding, ottoman, sultanate, through, conquest, or, declarations, of, allegiance, as, sultan, mehmed, ii, conquered, constantinople, today, named, istanbul, in, 1453, transforming, it, into, the, new, ottoman, capital, the, state, grew, into, a, substantial, empire, expanding, deep, into, europe, northern, africa, and, the, middle, east, with, most, of, the, balkans, under, ottoman, rule, by, the, mid, 16th, century, ottoman, territory, increased, exponentially, under, sultan, selim, i, who, assumed, the, caliphate, in, 1517, as, the, ottomans, turned, east, and, conquered, western, arabia, egypt, mesopotamia, and, the, levant, among, other, territories, within, the, next, few, decades, much, of, the, north, african, coast, except, morocco, became, part, of, the, ottoman, realm, the, empire, reached, its, apex, under, suleiman, the, magnificent, in, the, 16th, century, when, it, stretched, from, the, persian, gulf, in, the, east, to, algeria, in, the, west, and, from, yemen, in, the, south, to, hungary, and, parts, of, ukraine, in, the, north, according, to, the, ottoman, decline, thesis, suleiman, s, reign, was, the, zenith, of, the, ottoman, classical, period, during, which, ottoman, culture, arts, and, political, influence, flourished, the, empire, reached, its, maximum, territorial, extent, in, 1683, on, the, eve, of, the, battle, of, vienna, from, 1699, onwards, the, ottoman, empire, began, to, lose, territory, over, the, course, of, the, next, two, centuries, due, to, internal, stagnation, costly, defensive, wars, european, colonialism, and, nationalist, revolts, among, its, multiethnic, subjects, in, any, case, the, need, to, modernise, was, evident, to, the, empire, s, leaders, by, the, early, 19th, century, and, numerous, administrative, reforms, were, implemented, in, an, attempt, to, forestall, the, decline, of, the, empire, with, varying, degrees, of, success, the, gradual, weakening, of, the, ottoman, empire, gave, rise, to, the, eastern, question, in, the, mid, 19th, century, the, empire, came, to, an, end, in, the, aftermath, of, its, defeat, in, world, war, i, when, its, remaining, territory, was, partitioned, by, the, allies, the, sultanate, was, officially, abolished, by, the, government, of, the, turkish, grand, national, assembly, in, ankara, on, 1, november, 1922, following, the, turkish, war, of, independence, throughout, its, more, than, 600, years, of, existence, the, ottoman, empire, has, left, a, profound, legacy, in, the, middle, east, and, southeast, europe, as, can, be, seen, in, the, customs, culture, and, cuisine, of, the, various, countries, that, were, once, part, of, its, realm, several, historians, such, as, british, historian, edward, gibbon, and, the, greek, historian, dimitri, kitsikis, have, argued, that, after, the, fall, of, constantinople, the, ottoman, state, took, over, the, machinery, of, the, byzantine, roman, state, and, that, the, ottoman, empire, was, in, essence, a, continuation, of, the, eastern, roman, empire, under, a, turkish, muslim, guise, the, american, historian, speros, vryonis, writes, that, the, ottoman, state, centred, on, a, byzantine, balkan, base, with, a, veneer, of, the, turkish, language, and, the, islamic, religion, kitsikis, and, the, american, historian, heath, lowry, posit, that, the, early, ottoman, state, was, a, predatory, confederacy, open, to, both, byzantine, christians, and, turkish, muslims, whose, primary, goal, was, attaining, booty, and, slaves, rather, than, spreading, islam, and, that, islam, only, later, became, the, empire, s, primary, characteristic, other, historians, have, followed, the, lead, of, the, austrian, historian, paul, wittek, who, emphasizes, the, early, ottoman, state, s, islamic, character, seeing, it, as, a, jihad, state, dedicated, to, expanding, the, muslim, world, many, historians, led, in, 1937, by, the, turkish, historian, mehmet, fuat, k, pr, l, championed, the, ghaza, thesis, according, to, which, the, early, ottoman, state, was, a, continuation, of, the, way, of, life, of, the, nomadic, turkic, tribes, who, had, come, from, east, asia, to, anatolia, via, central, asia, and, the, middle, east, on, a, much, larger, scale, they, argued, that, the, most, important, cultural, influences, on, the, ottoman, state, came, from, persia, the, british, historian, norman, stone, suggests, many, continuities, between, the, eastern, roman, and, ottoman, empires, such, as, that, the, zeugarion, tax, of, byzantium, became, the, ottoman, resm, i, ift, tax, that, the, pronoia, land, holding, system, that, linked, the, amount, of, land, one, owned, with, one, s, ability, to, raise, cavalry, became, the, ottoman, timar, system, and, that, the, ottoman, land, measurement, the, d, n, m, was, the, same, as, the, byzantine, stremma, stone, also, argues, that, although, sunni, islam, was, the, state, religion, the, ottoman, state, supported, and, controlled, the, eastern, orthodox, church, which, in, return, for, accepting, that, control, became, the, ottoman, empire, s, largest, land, holder, despite, the, similarities, stone, argues, that, a, crucial, difference, is, that, the, land, grants, under, the, timar, system, were, not, hereditary, at, first, even, after, they, became, inheritable, land, ownership, in, the, ottoman, empire, remained, highly, insecure, and, the, sultan, revoked, land, grants, whenever, he, wished, stone, argued, this, insecurity, in, land, tenure, strongly, discouraged, timariots, from, seeking, long, term, development, of, their, land, and, instead, led, them, to, adopt, a, strategy, of, short, term, exploitation, which, had, deleterious, effects, on, the, ottoman, economy, before, the, reforms, of, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, the, state, organisation, of, the, ottoman, empire, was, a, system, with, two, main, dimensions, the, military, administration, and, the, civil, administration, the, sultan, was, in, the, highest, position, in, the, system, the, civil, system, was, based, on, local, administrative, units, based, on, the, region, s, characteristics, the, state, had, control, over, the, clergy, certain, pre, islamic, turkish, traditions, that, had, survived, the, adoption, of, administrative, and, legal, practices, from, islamic, iran, remained, important, in, ottoman, administrative, circles, according, to, ottoman, understanding, the, state, s, primary, responsibility, was, to, defend, and, extend, the, land, of, the, muslims, and, to, ensure, security, and, harmony, within, its, borders, in, the, overarching, context, of, orthodox, islamic, practice, and, dynastic, sovereignty, the, ottoman, empire, or, as, a, dynastic, institution, the, house, of, osman, was, unprecedented, and, unequaled, in, the, islamic, world, for, its, size, and, duration, in, europe, only, the, house, of, habsburg, had, a, similarly, unbroken, line, of, sovereigns, kings, emperors, from, the, same, family, who, ruled, for, so, long, and, during, the, same, period, between, the, late, 13th, and, early, 20th, centuries, the, ottoman, dynasty, was, turkish, in, origin, on, eleven, occasions, the, sultan, was, deposed, replaced, by, another, sultan, of, the, ottoman, dynasty, who, were, either, the, former, sultan, s, brother, son, or, nephew, because, he, was, perceived, by, his, enemies, as, a, threat, to, the, state, there, were, only, two, attempts, in, ottoman, history, to, unseat, the, ruling, ottoman, dynasty, both, failures, which, suggests, a, political, system, that, for, an, extended, period, was, able, to, manage, its, revolutions, without, unnecessary, instability, as, such, the, last, ottoman, sultan, mehmed, vi, r, 1918, 1922, was, a, direct, patrilineal, male, line, descendant, of, the, first, ottoman, sultan, osman, i, d, 1323, 4, which, was, unparalleled, in, both, europe, e, g, the, male, line, of, the, house, of, habsburg, became, extinct, in, 1740, and, in, the, islamic, world, the, primary, purpose, of, the, imperial, harem, was, to, ensure, the, birth, of, male, heirs, to, the, ottoman, throne, and, secure, the, continuation, of, the, direct, patrilineal, male, line, power, of, the, ottoman, sultans, in, the, future, generations, the, highest, position, in, islam, caliph, was, claimed, by, the, sultans, starting, with, selim, i, which, was, established, as, the, ottoman, caliphate, the, ottoman, sultan, p, di, h, or, lord, of, kings, served, as, the, empire, s, sole, regent, and, was, considered, to, be, the, embodiment, of, its, government, though, he, did, not, always, exercise, complete, control, the, imperial, harem, was, one, of, the, most, important, powers, of, the, ottoman, court, it, was, ruled, by, the, valide, sultan, on, occasion, the, valide, sultan, became, involved, in, state, politics, for, a, time, the, women, of, the, harem, effectively, controlled, the, state, in, what, was, termed, the, sultanate, of, women, new, sultans, were, always, chosen, from, the, sons, of, the, previous, sultan, the, strong, educational, system, of, the, palace, school, was, geared, towards, eliminating, the, unfit, potential, heirs, and, establishing, support, among, the, ruling, elite, for, a, successor, the, palace, schools, which, also, educated, the, future, administrators, of, the, state, were, not, a, single, track, first, the, madrasa, medrese, was, designated, for, the, muslims, and, educated, scholars, and, state, officials, according, to, islamic, tradition, the, financial, burden, of, the, medrese, was, supported, by, vakif, s, allowing, children, of, poor, families, to, move, to, higher, social, levels, and, income, the, second, track, was, a, free, boarding, school, for, the, christians, the, ender, n, which, recruited, 3, 000, students, annually, from, christian, boys, between, eight, and, twenty, years, old, from, one, in, forty, families, among, the, communities, settled, in, rumelia, or, the, balkans, a, process, known, as, devshirme, dev, irme, though, the, sultan, was, the, supreme, monarch, the, sultan, s, political, and, executive, authority, was, delegated, the, politics, of, the, state, had, a, number, of, advisors, and, ministers, gathered, around, a, council, known, as, divan, the, divan, in, the, years, when, the, ottoman, state, was, still, a, beylik, was, composed, of, the, elders, of, the, tribe, its, composition, was, later, modified, to, include, military, officers, and, local, elites, such, as, religious, and, political, advisors, later, still, beginning, in, 1320, a, grand, vizier, was, appointed, to, assume, certain, of, the, sultan, s, responsibilities, the, grand, vizier, had, considerable, independence, from, the, sultan, with, almost, unlimited, powers, of, appointment, dismissal, and, supervision, beginning, with, the, late, 16th, century, sultans, withdrew, from, politics, and, the, grand, vizier, became, the, de, facto, head, of, state, throughout, ottoman, history, there, were, many, instances, in, which, local, governors, acted, independently, and, even, in, opposition, to, the, ruler, after, the, young, turk, revolution, of, 1908, the, ottoman, state, became, a, constitutional, monarchy, the, sultan, no, longer, had, executive, powers, a, parliament, was, formed, with, representatives, chosen, from, the, provinces, the, representatives, formed, the, imperial, government, of, the, ottoman, empire, this, eclectic, administration, was, apparent, even, in, the, diplomatic, correspondence, of, the, empire, which, was, initially, undertaken, in, the, greek, language, to, the, west, the, tughra, were, calligraphic, monograms, or, signatures, of, the, ottoman, sultans, of, which, there, were, 35, carved, on, the, sultan, s, seal, they, bore, the, names, of, the, sultan, and, his, father, the, statement, and, prayer, ever, victorious, was, also, present, in,

over, its, subjects, at, the, same, time, the, qanun, or, kanun, dynastic, law, co, existed, with, religious, law, or, sharia, the, ottoman, empire, was, always, organized, around, a, system, of, local, jurisprudence, legal, administration, in, the, ottoman, empire, was, part, of, a, larger, scheme, of, balancing, central, and, local, authority, ottoman, power, revolved, crucially, around, the, administration, of, the, rights, to, land, which, gave, a, space, for, the, local, authority, to, develop, the, needs, of, the, local, millet, the, jurisdictional, complexity, of, the, ottoman, empire, was, aimed, to, permit, the, integration, of, culturally, and, religiously, different, groups, the, ottoman, system, had, three, court, systems, one, for, muslims, one, for, non, muslims,

administrative, qanun, i, e, laws, a, system, based, upon, the, turkic, yassa, and, t, re, which, were, developed, in, the, pre, islamic, era, these, court, categories, were, not, however, wholly, exclusive, for, instance, the, islamic, courts, which, were, the, empire, s, primary, courts, could, also, be, used, to, settle, a, trade, conflict, or, disputes, between, litigants, of, differing, religions, and, jews, and, christians, often, went, to, them, to, obtain, a, more, forceful, ruling, on, an, issue, the, ottoman, state, tended, not, to, interfere, with, non, muslim, religious, law, systems, despite, legally, having, a, voice, to, do, so, through, local, governors, the, islamic, sharia, law, system, had, been, developed, from, a, combination, of, the, qur, an, the, had, th, or,

more, with, local, customs, and, traditions, in, the, areas, that, they, administered, however, the, ottoman, court, system, lacked, an, appellate, structure, leading, to, jurisdictional, case, strategies, where, plaintiffs, could, take, their, disputes, from, one, court, system, to, another, until, they, achieved, a, ruling, that, was, in, their, favour, in, the, late, 19th, century, the, ottoman, legal, system, saw, substantial, reform, this, process, of, legal, modernisation, began, with, the, edict, of, g, lhane, of, 1839, these, reforms, included, the, fair, and, public, trial, of,

ottoman, empire, was, first, subdivided, into, provinces, in, the, sense, of, fixed, territorial, units, with, governors, appointed, by, the, sultan, in, the, late, 14th, century, the, eyalet, also, pashalik, or, beylerbeylik, was, the, territory, of, office, of, a, beylerbey, lord, of, lords, or, governor, and, was, further, subdivided, into, sanjaks, the, vilayets, were, introduced, with, the,

a, policy, for, the, development, of, bursa, edirne, and, istanbul, successive, ottoman, capitals, into, major, commercial, and, industrial, centres, considering, that, merchants, and, artisans, were, indispensable, in, creating, a, new, metropolis, to, this, end, mehmed, and, his, successor, bayezid, also, encouraged, and, welcomed, migration, of, the, jews, from, different, parts, of, europe, who, were, settled, in, istanbul, and, other, port, cities, like, salonica, in, many, places, in, europe, jews, were, suffering, persecution, at, the, hands, of, their, christian, counterparts, such, as, in, spain, after, the, conclusion, of, the, reconquista, the, tolerance, displayed, by, the, turks, was, welcomed, by, the, immigrants, the, ottoman, economic, mind, was, closely, related, to, the, basic, concepts, of, state, and, society, in, the, middle, east, in, which, the, ultimate, goal, of, a, state, was, consolidation, and, extension, of, the, ruler, s, power, and, the, way, to, reach, it, was, to, get, rich, resources, of, revenues, by, making, the, productive, classes, prosperous, the, ultimate, aim, was, to, increase, the, state, revenues, without, damaging, the, prosperity, of, subjects, to, prevent, the, emergence, of, social, disorder, and, to, keep, the, traditional, organization, of, the, society, intact, the, ottoman, economy, greatly, expanded, during, the, early, modern, period, with, particularly, high, growth, rates, during, the, first, half, of, the, eighteenth, century, the, empire, s, annual, income, quadrupled, between, 1523, and, 1748, adjusted, for, inflation, the, organization, of, the, treasury, and, chancery, were, developed, under, the, ottoman, empire, more, than, any, other, islamic, government, and, until, the, 17th, century, they, were, the, leading, organization, among, all, their, contemporaries, this, organisation, developed, a, scribal, bureaucracy, known, as, men, of, the, pen, as, a, distinct, group, partly, highly, trained, ulama, which, developed, into, a, professional, body, the, effectiveness, of, this, professional, financial, body, stands, behind, the, success, of, many, great, ottoman, statesmen, modern, ottoman, studies, indicate, that, the, change, in, relations, between, the, ottoman, turks, and, central, europe, was, caused, by, the, opening, of, the, new, sea, routes, it, is, possible, to, see, the, decline, in, the, significance, of, the, land, routes, to, the, east, as, western, europe, opened, the, ocean, routes, that, bypassed, the, middle, east, and, the, mediterranean, as, parallel, to, the, decline, of, the, ottoman, empire, itself, the, anglo, ottoman, treaty, also, known, as, the, treaty, of, balta, liman, that, opened, the, ottoman, markets, directly, to, english, and, french, competitors, can, be, seen, as, one, of, the, staging, posts, along, with, this, development, by, developing, commercial, centres, and, routes, encouraging, people, to, extend, the, area, of, cultivated, land, in, the, country, and, international, trade, through, its, dominions, the, state, performed, basic, economic, functions, in, the, empire, but, in, all, this, the, financial, and, political, interests, of, the, state, were, dominant, within, the, social, and, political, system, they, were, living, in, ottoman, administrators, could, not, see, the, desirability, of, the, dynamics, and, principles, of, the, capitalist, and, mercantile, economies, developing, in, western, europe, economic, historian, paul, bairoch, argues, that, free, trade, contributed, to, deindustrialisation, in, the, ottoman, empire, in, contrast, to, the, protectionism, of, china, japan, and, spain, the, ottoman, empire, had, a, liberal, trade, policy, open, to, foreign, imports, this, has, origins, in, capitulations, of, the, ottoman, empire, dating, back, to, the, first, commercial, treaties, signed, with, france, in, 1536, and, taken, further, with, capitulations, in, 1673, and, 1740, which, lowered, duties, to, 3, for, imports, and, exports, the, liberal, ottoman, policies, were, praised, by, british, economists, such, as, john, ramsay, mcculloch, in, his, dictionary, of, commerce, 1834, but, later, criticized, by, british, politicians, such, as, prime, minister, benjamin, disraeli, who, cited, the, ottoman, empire, as, an, instance, of, the, injury, done, by, unrestrained, competition, in, the, 1846, corn, laws, debate, a, population, estimate, for, the, empire, of, 11, 692, 480, for, the, 1520, 1535, period, was, obtained, by, counting, the, households, in, ottoman, tithe, registers, and, multiplying, this, number, by, 5, for, unclear, reasons, the, population, in, the, 18th, century, was, lower, than, that, in, the, 16th, century, an, estimate, of, 7, 230, 660, for, the, first, census, held, in, 1831, is, considered, a, serious, undercount, as, this, census, was, meant, only, to, register, possible, conscripts, censuses, of, ottoman, territories, only, began, in, the, early, 19th, century, figures, from, 1831, onwards, are, available, as, official, census, results, but, the, censuses, did, not, cover, the, whole, population, for, example, the, 1831, census, only, counted, men, and, did, not, cover, the, whole, empire, for, earlier, periods, estimates, of, size, and, distribution, of, the, population, are, based, on, observed, demographic, patterns, however, it, began, to, rise, to, reach, 25, 32, million, by, 1800, with, around, 10, million, in, the, european, provinces, primarily, in, the, balkans, 11, million, in, the, asiatic, provinces, and, around, 3, million, in, the, african, provinces, population, densities, were, higher, in, the, european, provinces, double, those, in, anatolia,

hit, egypt, alone, between, 1687, and, 1731, and, the, last, famine, to, hit, anatolia, was, four, decades, later, the, rise, of, port, cities, saw, the, clustering, of, populations, caused, by, the, development, of, steamships, and, railroads, urbanization, increased, from, 1700, to, 1922, with, towns, and, cities, growing, improvements, in, health, and, sanitation, made, them, more, attractive, to, live, and, work, in, port, cities, like, salonica, in, greece, saw, its, population, rise, from, 55, 000, in, 1800, to, 160, 000, in, 1912, and, zmir, which, had, a, population, of, 150, 000, in, 1800, grew, to, 300, 000, by, 1914, some, regions, conversely, had, population, falls, belgrade, saw, its, population, drop, from, 25, 000, to, 8, 000, mainly, due, to, political, strife, economic, and, political, migrations, made, an, impact, across, the, empire, for, example, the, russian, and, austria, habsburg, annexation, of, the, crimean, and, balkan, regions, respectively, saw, large,

east, particularly, the, conquest, of, the, entire, mamluk, sultanate, of, egypt, on, the, early, 16th, century, these, conquests, further, solidified, the, ottoman, claim, of, being, an, islamic, caliphate, although, ottoman, sultans, had, been, claiming, the, title, of, caliph, since, the, reign, of, murad, i, 1362, 1389, the, caliphate, was, officially, transferred, from, the, mamluks, to, the, ottoman, sultanate, in, 1517, whose, members, were, recognized, as, caliphs, until, the, office, s, abolition, on, 3, march, 1924, by, the, republic, of, turkey, and, the, exile, of, the, last, caliph, abd, lmecid, ii, to, france, in, accordance, with, the, muslim, dhimmi, system, the, ottoman, empire, guaranteed, limited, freedoms, to, christians, jews, and, other, people, of, the, book, such, as, the, right, to, worship, own, property, and, be, exempt, from, the, obligatory, alms, z, akat, required, of, muslims, however, non, muslims, or, dhimmi, were, subject, to, various, legal, restrictions, including, being, forbidden, to, carry, weapons, ride, on, horseback, or, have, their, homes, overlook, those, of, muslims, likewise, they, were, required, to, pay, higher, taxes, than, muslim, subjects, including, the, jizya, which, was, a, key, source, of, state, revenue, many, christians, and, jews, converted, to, islam, to, secure, full, social, and, legal, status, though, most, continued, to, practice, their, faith, without, restriction, the, ottomans, developed, a, unique, sociopolitical, system, known, as, the, millet, which, granted, non, muslim, communities, a, large, degree, of, political, legal, and, religious, autonomy, in, essence, members, of, a, millet, were, subjects, of, the, empire, but, not, subject, to, the, muslim, faith, or, islamic, law, a, millet, could, govern, its, own, affairs, such, as, raising, taxes, and, resolving, internal, legal, disputes, with, little, or, no, interference, from, ottoman, authorities, so, long, as, its, members, were, loyal, to, the, sultan, and, adhered, to, the, rules, concerning, dhimmi, a, quintessential, example, is, the, ancient, orthodox, community, of, mount, athos, which, was, permitted, to, retain, its, autonomy, and, was, never, subject, to, occupation, or, forced, conversion, even, special, laws, were, enacted, to, protect, it, from, outsiders, the, rum, millet, which, encompassed, most, eastern, orthodox, christians, was, governed, by, the, byzantine, era, corpus, juris, civilis, code, of, justinian, with, the, ecumenical, patriarch, designated, the, highest, religious, and, political, authority, millet, bashi, or, ethnarch, likewise, ottoman, jews, came, under, the, authority, of, the, haham, ba, or, ottoman, chief, rabbi, while, armenians, were, under, the, authority, of, the, chief, bishop, of, the, armenian, apostolic, church, as, the, largest, group, of, non, muslim, subjects, the, rum, millet, enjoyed, several, special, privileges, in, politics, and, commerce, however, jews, and, armenians, were, also, well, represented, among, the, wealthy, merchant, class, as, well, as, in, public, administration, some, modern, scholars, consider, the, millet, system, to, be, an, early, example, of, religious, pluralism, as, it, accorded, minority, religious, groups, official, recognition, and, tolerance, beginning, in, the, early, 19th, century, society, government, and, religion, were, interrelated, in, a, complex, overlapping, way, that, was, deemed, inefficient, by, atat, rk, who, systematically, dismantled, it, after, 1922, in, constantinople, the, sultan, ruled, two, distinct, domains, the, secular, government, and, the, religious, hierarchy, religious, officials, formed, the, ulama, who, had, control, of, religious, teachings, and, theology, and, also, the, empire, s, judicial, system, giving, them, a, major, voice, in, day, to, day, affairs, in, communities, across, the, empire, but, not, including, the, non, muslim, millets, they, were, powerful, enough, to, reject, the, military, reforms, proposed, by, sultan, selim, iii, his, successor, sultan, mahmud, ii, r, 1808, 1839, first, won, ulama, approval, before, proposing, similar, reforms, the, secularisation, program, brought, by, atat, rk, ended, the, ulema, and, their, institutions, the, caliphate, was, abolished, madrasas, were, closed, down, and, the, sharia, courts, were, abolished, he, replaced, the, arabic, alphabet, with, latin, letters, ended, the, religious, school, system, and, gave, women, some, political, rights, many, rural, traditionalists, never, accepted, this, secularisation, and, by, the, 1990s, they, were, reasserting, a, demand, for, a, larger, role, for, islam, the, janissaries, were, a, highly, formidable, military, unit, in, the, early, years, but, as, western, europe, modernized, its, military, organization, technology, the, janissaries, became, a, reactionary, force, that, resisted, all, change, steadily, the, ottoman, military, power, became, outdated, but, when, the, janissaries, felt, their, privileges, were, being, threatened, or, outsiders, wanted, to, modernize, them, or, they, might, be, superseded, by, the, cavalrymen, they, rose, in, rebellion, the, rebellions, were, highly, violent, on, both, sides, but, by, the, time, the, janissaries, were, suppressed, it, was, far, too, late, for, ottoman, military, power, to, catch, up, with, the, west, the, political, system, was, transformed, by, the, destruction, of, the, janissaries, a, powerful, military, governmental, police, force, which, revolted, in, the, auspicious, incident, of, 1826, sultan, mahmud, ii, crushed, the, revolt, executed, the, leaders, and, disbanded, the, large, organization, that, set, the, stage, for, a, slow, process, of, modernization, of, government, functions, as, the, government, sought, with, mixed, success, to, adopt, the, main, elements, of, western, bureaucracy, and, military, technology, the, janissaries, had, been, recruited, from, christians, and, other, minorities, their, abolition, enabled, the, emergence, of, a, turkish, elite, to, control, the, ottoman, empire, a, large, number, of, ethnic, and, religious, minorities, were, tolerated, in, their, own, separate, segregated, domains, called, millets, they, were, primarily, greek, armenian, or, jewish, in, each, locality, they, governed, themselves, spoke, their, own, language, ran, their, own, schools, cultural, and, religious, institutions, and, paid, somewhat, higher, taxes, they, had, no, power, outside, the, millet, the, imperial, government, protected, them, and, prevented, major, violent, clashes, between, ethnic, groups, ethnic, nationalism, based, on, distinctive, religion, and, language, provided, a, centripetal, force, that, eventually, destroyed, the, ottoman, empire, in, addition, muslim, ethnic, groups, which, were, not, part, of, the, millet, system, especially, the, arabs, and, the, kurds, were, outside, the, turkish, culture, and, developed, their, own, separate, nationalism, the, british, sponsored, arab, nationalism, in, the, first, world, war, promising, an, independent, arab, state, in, return, for, arab, support, most, arabs, supported, the, sultan, but, those, near, mecca, believed, in, and, supported, the, british, promise, at, the, local, level, power, was, held, beyond, the, control, of, the, sultan, by, the, ayans, or, local, notables, the, ayan, collected, taxes, formed, local, armies, to, compete, with, other, notables, took, a, reactionary, attitude, toward, political, or, economic, change, and, often, defied, policies, handed, down, by, the, sultan, after, the, 18th, century, the, ottoman, empire, was, shrinking, as, russia, put, on, heavy, pressure, and, expanded, to, its, south, egypt, became, effectively, independent, in, 1805, and, the, british, later, took, it, over, along, with, cyprus, greece, became, independent, and, serbia, and, other, balkan, areas, became, highly, restive, as, the, force, of, nationalism, pushed, against, imperialism, the, french, took, over, algeria, and, tunisia, the, europeans, all, thought, that, the, empire, was, a, sick, man, in, rapid, decline, only, the, germans, seemed, helpful, and, their, support, led, to, the, ottoman, empire, joining, the, central, powers, in, 1915, with, the, result, that, they, came, out, as, one, of, the, heaviest, losers, of, the, first, world, war, in, 1918, the, ottomans, absorbed, some, of, the, traditions, art, and, institutions, of, cultures, in, the, regions, they, conquered, and, added, new, dimensions, to, them, numerous, traditions, and, cultural, traits, of, previous, empires, in, fields, such, as, architecture, cuisine, music, leisure, and, government, were, adopted, by, the, ottoman, turks, who, developed, them, into, new, forms, resulting, in, a, new, and, distinctively, ottoman, cultural, identity, although, the, predominant, literary, language, of, the, ottoman, empire, was, turkish, persian, was, the, preferred, vehicle, for, the, projection, of, an, imperial, image, slavery, was, part, of, ottoman, society, with, most, slaves, employed, as, domestic, servants, agricultural, slavery, like, that, in, the, americas, was, relatively, rare, unlike, systems, of, chattel, slavery, slaves, under, islamic, law, were, not, regarded, as, movable, property, and, the, children, of, female, slaves, were, born, legally, free, female, slaves, were, still, sold, in, the, empire, as, late, as, 1908, during, the, 19th, century, the, empire, came, under, pressure, from, western, european, countries, to, outlaw, the, practice, policies, developed, by, various, sultans, throughout, the, 19th, century, attempted, to, curtail, the, ottoman, slave, trade, but, slavery, had, centuries, of, religious, backing, and, sanction, and, so, was, never, abolished, in, the, empire, plague, remained, a, major, scourge, in, ottoman, society, until, the, second, quarter, of, the, 19th, century, between, 1701, and, 1750, 37, larger, and, smaller, plague, epidemics, were, recorded, in, istanbul, and, 31, between, 1751, and, 1801, ottomans, adopted, persian, bureaucratic, traditions, and, culture, the, sultans, also, made, an, important, contribution, in, the, development, of, persian, literature, language, was, not, an, obvious, sign, of, group, connection, and, identity, in, the, 16th, century, among, the, rulers, of, the, ottoman, empire, safavid, iran, and, abu, l, khayrid, shibanids, of, central, asia, hence, the, ruling, classes, of, all, three, polities, were, bilingual, in, varieties, of, persian, and, turkic, but, in, the, century, s, final, quarter, linguistic, adjustments, occurred, in, the, ottoman, and, safavid, realms, defined, by, a, new, rigidity, that, favoured, ottoman, turkish, and, persian, respectively, in, the, ottoman, empire, each, millet, established, a, schooling, system, serving, its, members, education, was, therefore, largely, divided, on, ethnic, and, religious, lines, few, non, muslims, attended, schools, for, muslim, students, and, vice, versa, most, institutions, that, served, all, ethnic, and, religious, groups, taught, in, french, or, other, languages, several, foreign, schools, frerler, mektebleri, operated, by, religious, clergy, primarily, served, christians, although, some, muslim, students, attended, garnett, described, the, schools, for, christians, and, jews, as, organised, upon, european, models, with, voluntary, contributions, supporting, their, operation, and, most, of, them, well, attended, and, with, a, high, standard, of, education, the, two, primary, streams, of, ottoman, written, literature, are, poetry, and, prose, poetry, was, by, far, the, dominant, stream, the, earliest, work, of, ottoman, historiography, for, example, the, skendern, me, was, composed, by, the, poet, taceddin, ahmedi, 1334, 1413, until, the, 19th, century, ottoman, prose, did, not, contain, any, examples, of, fiction, there, were, no, counterparts, to, for, instance, the, european, romance, short, story, or, novel, analog, genres, did, exist, though, in, both, turkish, folk, literature, and, in, divan, poetry, ottoman, divan, poetry, was, a, highly, ritualized, and, symbolic, art, form, from, the, persian, poetry, that, largely, inspired, it, it, inherited, a, wealth, of, symbols, whose, meanings, and, interrelationships, both, of, similitude, mura, t, i, naz, r, ten, s, b, and, opposition, tez, d, were, more, or, less, prescribed, divan, poetry, was, composed, through, the, constant, juxtaposition, of, many, such, images, within, a, strict, metrical, framework, allowing, numerous, potential, meanings, to, emerge, the, vast, majority, of, divan, poetry, was, lyric, in, nature, either, gazels, which, make, up, the, greatest, part, of, the, repertoire, of, the, tradition, or, kas, des, but, there, were, other, common, genres, especially, the, mesnev, a, kind, of, verse, romance, and, thus, a, variety, of, narrative, poetry, the, two, most, notable, examples, of, this, form, are, the, leyli, and, majnun, of, fuzuli, and, the, h, sn, a, k, of, eyh, g, lib, the, seyahatn, me, of, evliya, elebi, 1611, 1682, is, an, outstanding, example, of, travel, literature, until, the, 19th, century, ottoman, prose, did, not, develop, to, the, extent, that, contemporary, divan, poetry, did, a, large, part, of, the, reason, was, that, much, prose, was, expected, to, adhere, to, the, rules, of, sec, also, transliterated, as, seci, or, rhymed, prose, a, type, of, writing, descended, from, the, arabic, saj, that, prescribed, that, between, each, adjective, and, noun, in, a, string, of, words, such, as, a, sentence, there, must, be, a, rhyme, nevertheless, there, was, a, tradition, of, prose, in, the, literature, of, the, time, though, it, was, exclusively, nonfictional, one, apparent, exception, was, muhayyel, t, fancies, by, giritli, ali, aziz, efendi, a, collection, of, stories, of, the, fantastic, written, in, 1796, though, not, published, until, 1867, the, first, novel, published, in, the, ottoman, empire, was, vartan, pasha, s, 1851, the, story, of, akabi, turkish, akabi, hikyayesi, it, was, written, in, turkish, but, with, armenian, script, due, to, historically, close, ties, with, france, french, literature, constituted, the, major, western, influence, on, ottoman, literature, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 19th, century, as, a, result, many, of, the, same, movements, prevalent, in, france, during, this, period, had, ottoman, equivalents, in, the, developing, ottoman, prose, tradition, for, instance, the, influence, of, romanticism, can, be, seen, during, the, tanzimat, period, and, that, of, the, realist, and, naturalist, movements, in, subsequent, periods, in, the, poetic, tradition, on, the, other, hand, the, influence, of, the, symbolist, and, parnassian, movements, was, paramount, many, of, the, writers, in, the, tanzimat, period, wrote, in, several, different, genres, simultaneously, for, instance, the, poet, nam, k, kemal, also, wrote, the, important, 1876, novel, ntib, h, awakening, while, the, journalist, brahim, inasi, is, noted, for, writing, in, 1860, the, first, modern, turkish, play, the, one, act, comedy, air, evlenmesi, the, poet, s, marriage, an, earlier, play, a, farce, titled, vak, yi, i, acibe, ve, hav, dis, i, garibe, yi, kef, ger, ahmed, the, strange, events, and, bizarre, occurrences, of, the, cobbler, ahmed, dates, from, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, but, there, is, doubt, about, its, authenticity, in, a, similar, vein, the, novelist, ahmed, midhat, efendi, wrote, important, novels, in, each, of, the, major, movements, romanticism, hasan, mell, h, y, hud, s, rr, inde, esr, r, 1873, hasan, the, sailor, or, the, mystery, within, the, mystery, realism, hen, z, on, yedi, ya, nda, 1881, just, seventeen, years, old, and, naturalism, m, hed, t, 1891, observations, this, diversity, was, in, part, due, to, tanzimat, writers, wish, to, disseminate, as, much, of, the, new, literature, as, possible, in, the, hopes, that, it, would, contribute, to, a, revitalization, of, ottoman, social, structures, the, media, of, the, ottoman, empire, was, diverse, with, newspapers, and, journals, published, in, languages, including, french, greek, and, german, many, of, these, publications, were, centred, in, constantinople, but, there, were, also, french, language, newspapers, produced, in, beirut, salonika, and, smyrna, non, muslim, ethnic, minorities, in, the, empire, used, french, as, a, lingua, franca, and, used, french, language, publications, while, some, provincial, newspapers, were, published, in, arabic, the, use, of, french, in, the, media, persisted, until, the, end, of, the, empire, in, 1923, and, for, a, few, years, thereafter, in, the, republic, of, turkey, the, architecture, of, the, empire, developed, from, earlier, seljuk, turkish, architecture, with, influences, from, byzantine, and, iranian, architecture, and, other, architectural, traditions, in, the, middle, east, early, ottoman, architecture, experimented, with, multiple, building, types, over, the, course, of, the, 13th, to, 15th, centuries, progressively, evolving, into, the, classical, ottoman, style, of, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, which, was, also, strongly, influenced, by, the, hagia, sophia, the, most, important, architect, of, the, classical, period, is, mimar, sinan, whose, major, works, include, the, ehzade, mosque, s, leymaniye, mosque, and, selimiye, mosque, the, greatest, of, the, court, artists, enriched, the, ottoman, empire, with, many, pluralistic, artistic, influences, such, as, mixing, traditional, byzantine, art, with, elements, of, chinese, art, the, second, half, of, the, 16th, century, also, saw, the, apogee, of, certain, decorative, arts, most, notably, in, the, use, of, iznik, tiles, beginning, in, the, 18th, century, ottoman, architecture, was, influenced, by, the, baroque, architecture, in, western, europe, resulting, in, the, ottoman, baroque, style, nuruosmaniye, mosque, is, one, of, the, most, important, examples, from, this, period, the, last, ottoman, period, saw, more, influences, from, western, europe, brought, in, by, architects, such, as, those, from, the, balyan, family, empire, style, and, neoclassical, motifs, were, introduced, and, a, trend, towards, eclecticism, was, evident, in, many, types, of, buildings, such, as, the, dolmaba, e, palace, the, last, decades, of, the, ottoman, empire, also, saw, the, development, of, a, new, architectural, style, called, neo, ottoman, or, ottoman, revivalism, also, known, as, the, first, national, architectural, movement, by, architects, such, as, mimar, kemaleddin, and, vedat, tek, ottoman, dynastic, patronage, was, concentrated, in, the, historic, capitals, of, bursa, edirne, and, istanbul, constantinople, as, well, as, in, several, other, important, administrative, centres, such, as, amasya, and, manisa, it, was, in, these, centres, that, most, important, developments, in, ottoman, architecture, occurred, and, that, the, most, monumental, ottoman, architecture, can, be, found, major, religious, monuments, were, typically, architectural, complexes, known, as, a, k, lliye, that, had, multiple, components, providing, different, services, or, amenities, in, addition, to, a, mosque, these, could, include, a, madrasa, a, hammam, an, imaret, a, sebil, a, market, a, caravanserai,

and, in, the, balkans, rumelia, but, in, the, more, distant, middle, eastern, and, north, african, provinces, older, islamic, architectural, styles, continued, to, hold, strong, influence, and, were, sometimes, blended, with, ottoman, styles, the, tradition, of, ottoman, miniatures, painted, to, illustrate, manuscripts, or, used, in, dedicated, albums, was, heavily, influenced, by, the, persian,

the, annual, motion, of, the, apogee, however, the, observatory, s, primary, purpose, was, almost, certainly, astrological, rather, than, astronomical, leading, to, its, destruction, in, 1580, due,
