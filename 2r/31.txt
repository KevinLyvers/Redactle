the, history, of, mexico, spans, more, than, three, millennia, beginning, with, the, early, settlement, over, 13, 000, years, ago, central, and, southern, mexico, known, as, mesoamerica, saw, the, rise, of, complex, civilizations, that, developed, glyphic, writing, systems, recording, political, histories, and, conquests, the, spanish, conquest, of, the, aztec, empire, in, the, early, 16th, century, established, new, spain, bringing, spanish, rule, christianity, and, european, influences, mexico, gained, independence, from, spain, in, 1821, after, a, prolonged, struggle, marked, by, the, mexican, war, of, independence, the, country, faced, numerous, challenges, in, the, 19th, century, including, regional, conflicts, caudillo, power, struggles, the, mexican, american, war, and, foreign, interventions, like, the, french, invasion, efforts, at, modernization, during, la, reforma, included, promoting, civil, liberties, and, the, separation, of, church, and, state, but, the, country, was, still, beset, by, internal, strife, and, external, threats, including, the, second, mexican, empire, the, late, 19th, century, porfiriato, era, brought, economic, growth, but, also, authoritarianism, and, social, inequality, which, eventually, fueled, the, mexican, revolution, in, 1910, the, revolution, led, to, significant, social, and, political, changes, with, the, emergence, of, the, institutional, revolutionary, party, pri, as, the, dominant, force, throughout, the, 20th, century, mexico, implemented, land, reforms, nationalized, key, industries, and, expanded, social, welfare, but, these, achievements, were, marred, by, corruption, violence, and, economic, crises, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, mexico, shifted, towards, privatization, and, trade, liberalization, culminating, in, the, signing, of, the, north, american, free, trade, agreement, nafta, in, 1994, the, turn, of, the, century, marked, a, significant, shift, in, mexico, s, political, landscape, with, the, opposition, national, action, party, pan, winning, the, presidency, in, 2000, ending, the, pri, s, long, standing, dominance, and, ushering, in, a, new, era, of, mexican, politics, the, 21st, century, has, seen, economic, disparities, drug, related, violence, and, corruption, administrations, have, focused, on, addressing, these, issues, with, mixed, success, the, election, of, andr, s, manuel, l, pez, obrador, in, 2018, marked, another, significant, shift, as, his, government, has, aimed, to, combat, corruption, reduce, inequality, and, address, the, violence, that, has, plagued, the, country, for, decades, large, and, complex, civilizations, developed, in, the, center, and, southern, regions, of, mexico, with, the, southern, region, extending, into, what, is, now, central, america, in, what, has, come, to, be, known, as, mesoamerica, the, civilizations, that, rose, and, declined, over, millennia, were, characterized, by, the, history, of, mexico, before, the, spanish, conquest, is, known, through, the, work, of, archaeologists, epigraphers, and, ethnohistorians, who, analyze, mesoamerican, indigenous, manuscripts, particularly, aztec, codices, mayan, codices, and, mixtec, codices, accounts, written, by, spaniards, at, the, time, of, the, conquest, the, conquistadores, and, by, indigenous, chroniclers, of, the, postconquest, period, constitute, the, principal, source, of, information, regarding, mexico, at, the, time, of, the, spanish, conquest, few, pictorial, manuscripts, or, codices, of, the, maya, mixtec, and, mexica, cultures, of, the, post, classic, period, survive, but, progress, has, been, made, particularly, in, the, area, of, maya, archaeology, and, epigraphy, the, presence, of, people, in, mesoamerica, was, once, thought, to, date, back, 40, 000, years, an, estimate, based, on, what, were, believed, to, be, ancient, footprints, discovered, in, the, valley, of, mexico, this, date, may, not, be, accurate, after, further, investigation, using, radiocarbon, dating, it, is, currently, unclear, whether, 23, 000, year, old, campfire, remains, found, in, the, valley, of, mexico, are, the, earliest, human, remains, uncovered, so, far, in, mexico, the, first, people, to, settle, in, mexico, encountered, a, climate, far, milder, than, the, current, one, in, particular, the, valley, of, mexico, contained, several, large, paleo, lakes, known, collectively, as, lake, texcoco, surrounded, by, dense, forest, deer, were, found, in, this, area, but, most, fauna, were, small, land, animals, and, fish, and, other, lacustrine, animals, were, found, in, the, lake, region, such, conditions, encouraged, the, initial, pursuit, of, a, hunter, gatherer, existence, indigenous, peoples, in, western, mexico, began, to, selectively, breed, maize, zea, mays, plants, between, 5, 000, and, 10, 000, years, ago, the, diet, of, ancient, central, and, southern, mexico, was, varied, including, domesticated, corn, or, maize, squashes, beans, tomatoes, peppers, cassavas, pineapples, chocolate, and, tobacco, the, three, sisters, corn, squash, and, beans, constituted, the, principal, diet, mesoamericans, had, belief, systems, where, every, element, of, the, cosmos, and, everything, that, forms, part, of, nature, represented, a, supernatural, manifestation, the, spiritual, pantheon, was, vast, and, extremely, complex, they, frequently, took, on, different, characteristics, and, even, names, in, other, areas, but, in, effect, they, transcended, cultures, and, time, great, masks, with, gaping, jaws, and, monstrous, features, in, stone, or, stucco, were, often, located, at, the, entrance, to, temples, symbolizing, a, cavern, or, cave, on, the, flanks, of, the, mountains, that, allowed, access, to, the, depths, of, mother, earth, and, the, shadowy, roads, that, lead, to, the, underworld, cults, connected, with, the, jaguar, and, jade, especially, permeated, religion, throughout, mesoamerica, jade, with, its, translucent, green, color, was, revered, along, with, water, as, a, symbol, of, life, and, fertility, the, jaguar, agile, powerful, and, fast, was, especially, connected, with, warriors, and, as, spirit, guides, of, shamans, despite, differences, in, chronology, or, geography, the, crucial, aspects, of, this, religious, pantheon, were, shared, amongst, the, people, of, ancient, mesoamerica, thus, this, quality, of, acceptance, of, new, gods, to, the, collection, of, existing, gods, may, have, been, one, of, the, shaping, characteristics, for, success, during, the, christianization, of, mesoamerica, new, gods, did, not, at, once, replace, the, old, they, initially, joined, the, ever, growing, family, of, deities, or, were, merged, with, existing, ones, that, seemed, to, share, similar, characteristics, or, responsibilities, mesoamerica, is, the, only, place, in, the, americas, where, indigenous, writing, systems, were, invented, and, used, before, european, colonization, while, the, types, of, writing, systems, in, mesoamerica, range, from, minimalist, picture, writing, to, complex, logophonetic, systems, capable, of, recording, speech, and, literature, they, all, share, some, core, features, that, make, them, visually, and, functionally, distinct, from, other, writing, systems, of, the, world, although, many, indigenous, manuscripts, have, been, lost, or, destroyed, texts, known, as, aztec, codices, mayan, codices, and, mixtec, codices, still, survive, and, are, of, intense, interest, to, scholars, during, the, pre, columbian, period, many, city, states, kingdoms, and, empires, competed, with, one, another, for, power, and, prestige, ancient, mexico, can, be, said, to, have, produced, five, major, civilizations, the, olmec, maya, teotihuacan, toltec, and, aztec, unlike, other, indigenous, mexican, societies, these, civilizations, except, the, politically, fragmented, maya, extended, their, political, and, cultural, reach, across, mexico, and, beyond, they, consolidated, power, and, exercised, influence, in, trade, art, politics, technology, and, religion, over, 3, 000, years, other, regional, powers, made, economic, and, political, alliances, with, them, many, made, war, on, them, but, almost, all, found, themselves, within, their, spheres, of, influence, the, olmec, first, appeared, along, the, atlantic, coast, in, what, is, now, the, state, of, tabasco, in, the, period, 1500, 900, bce, the, olmecs, were, the, first, mesoamerican, culture, to, produce, an, identifiable, artistic, and, cultural, style, and, may, also, have, been, the, society, that, invented, writing, in, mesoamerica, by, the, middle, preclassic, period, 900, 300, bce, olmec, artistic, styles, had, been, adopted, as, far, away, as, the, valley, of, mexico, and, costa, rica, maya, cultural, characteristics, such, as, the, rise, of, the, ahau, or, king, can, be, traced, from, 300, bce, onward, during, the, centuries, preceding, the, classical, period, maya, kingdoms, stretched, from, the, pacific, coasts, of, southern, mexico, and, guatemala, to, the, northern, yucat, n, peninsula, the, egalitarian, maya, society, of, pre, royal, centuries, gradually, led, to, a, society, controlled, by, a, wealthy, elite, that, began, building, large, ceremonial, temples, and, complexes, the, earliest, known, long, count, date, 199, ad, heralds, the, classic, period, during, which, the, maya, kingdoms, supported, a, population, numbering, in, the, millions, tikal, the, largest, of, the, kingdoms, alone, had, 500, 000, inhabitants, though, the, average, population, of, a, kingdom, was, much, smaller, somewhere, under, 50, 000, people, teotihuacan, is, an, enormous, archaeological, site, in, the, basin, of, mexico, containing, some, of, the, largest, pyramidal, structures, built, in, the, pre, columbian, americas, apart, from, the, pyramidal, structures, teotihuacan, is, also, known, for, its, large, residential, complexes, the, avenue, of, the, dead, and, numerous, colorful, well, preserved, murals, additionally, teotihuacan, produced, a, thin, orange, pottery, style, that, spread, through, mesoamerica, the, city, is, thought, to, have, been, established, around, 100, bce, and, continued, to, be, built, until, about, 250, ce, the, city, may, have, lasted, until, sometime, between, the, 7th, and, 8th, centuries, ce, at, its, zenith, perhaps, in, the, first, half, of, the, 1st, millennium, ce, teotihuacan, was, the, largest, city, in, the, pre, columbian, americas, at, this, time, it, may, have, had, more, than, 200, 000, inhabitants, placing, it, among, the, world, s, largest, cities, in, this, period, teotihuacan, was, even, home, to, multi, floor, apartment, compounds, built, to, accommodate, this, large, population, the, civilization, and, cultural, complex, associated, with, the, site, is, also, referred, to, as, teotihuacan, or, teotihuacano, although, it, is, a, subject, of, debate, whether, teotihuacan, was, the, center, of, a, state, empire, its, influence, throughout, mesoamerica, is, well, documented, the, ethnicity, of, the, inhabitants, of, teotihuacan, is, also, a, subject, of, debate, possible, candidates, are, the, nahua, otomi, or, totonac, ethnic, groups, scholars, have, also, suggested, that, teotihuacan, was, a, multiethnic, state, the, toltec, culture, is, an, archaeological, mesoamerican, culture, that, dominated, a, state, centered, in, tula, hidalgo, in, the, early, post, classic, period, of, mesoamerican, chronology, ca, 800, 1000, ad, the, later, aztec, culture, saw, the, toltecs, as, their, intellectual, and, cultural, predecessors, and, described, toltec, culture, emanating, from, tollan, nahuatl, for, tula, as, the, epitome, of, civilization, indeed, in, the, nahuatl, language, the, word, toltec, came, to, take, on, the, meaning, artisan, the, aztec, oral, and, pictographic, tradition, also, described, the, history, of, the, toltec, empire, giving, lists, of, rulers, and, their, exploits, among, modern, scholars, it, is, a, matter, of, debate, whether, the, aztec, narratives, of, toltec, history, should, be, given, credence, as, descriptions, of, actual, historical, events, other, controversies, relating, to, the, toltecs, include, how, best, to, understand, the, reasons, behind, the, perceived, similarities, in, architecture, and, iconography, between, the, archaeological, site, of, tula, and, the, maya, site, of, chich, n, itz, no, consensus, has, emerged, yet, about, the, degree, or, direction, of, influence, between, the, two, sites, the, nahua, people, began, to, enter, central, mexico, in, the, 6th, century, ce, by, the, 12th, century, they, had, established, their, center, at, azcapotzalco, the, city, of, the, tepanecs, the, mexica, people, arrived, in, the, valley, of, mexico, in, 1248, ce, they, had, migrated, from, the, deserts, north, of, the, rio, grande, over, a, period, traditionally, said, to, have, been, 100, years, they, may, have, thought, of, themselves, as, the, heirs, to, the, prestigious, civilizations, that, had, preceded, them, what, the, aztecs, initially, lacked, in, political, power, they, made, up, for, with, ambition, and, military, skill, in, 1325, they, established, the, biggest, city, in, the, world, tenochtitlan, aztec, religion, was, based, on, the, belief, in, the, continual, need, for, regular, offerings, of, human, blood, to, keep, their, deities, beneficent, to, meet, this, need, the, aztecs, sacrificed, thousands, of, people, this, belief, is, thought, to, have, been, common, throughout, the, nahuatl, people, to, acquire, captives, in, times, of, peace, the, aztecs, resorted, to, ritual, warfare, called, flower, war, the, tlaxcalteca, among, other, nahuatl, nations, were, forced, into, such, wars, though, human, sacrifice, was, common, in, mesoamerica, the, scale, of, human, sacrifice, under, the, aztecs, was, likely, unprecedented, in, the, region, in, 1428, the, aztecs, led, a, war, against, their, rulers, from, the, city, of, azcapotzalco, which, had, subjugated, most, of, the, valley, of, mexico, s, peoples, the, revolt, was, successful, and, the, aztecs, became, central, mexico, s, rulers, as, the, triple, alliance, leaders, the, alliance, was, composed, of, the, city, states, of, tenochtitlan, texcoco, and, tlacopan, at, their, peak, 350, 000, aztecs, presided, over, a, wealthy, tribute, empire, comprising, 10, million, people, almost, half, of, mexico, s, estimated, population, of, 24, million, their, empire, stretched, from, ocean, to, ocean, and, extended, into, central, america, the, westward, expansion, of, the, empire, was, halted, by, a, devastating, military, defeat, at, the, hands, of, the, purepecha, who, possessed, weapons, made, of, copper, the, empire, relied, upon, a, system, of, taxation, of, goods, and, services, which, was, collected, through, an, elaborate, bureaucracy, of, tax, collectors, courts, civil, servants, and, local, officials, who, were, installed, as, loyalists, to, the, triple, alliance, by, 1519, the, aztec, capital, tenochtitlan, the, site, of, modern, day, mexico, city, was, one, of, the, largest, cities, in, the, world, with, an, estimated, population, between, 200, 000, and, 300, 000, a, phase, of, inland, expeditions, and, conquest, followed, the, first, mainland, explorations, the, spanish, crown, extended, the, reconquista, effort, completed, in, spain, in, 1492, to, non, catholic, people, in, new, territories, in, 1502, on, the, coast,

survivors, of, a, spanish, shipwreck, in, 1511, only, two, survived, ger, nimo, de, aguilar, and, gonzalo, guerrero, until, further, contact, was, made, with, spanish, explorers, years, later, on, 8, february, 1517, an, expedition, led, by, francisco, hern, ndez, de, c, rdoba, left, the, harbor, of, santiago, de, cuba, to, explore, the, shores, of, southern, mexico, during, this, expedition, many, of, hern, ndez, s, men, were, killed, most, during, a, battle, near, the, town, of, champot, n, against, a, maya, army, hern, ndez, himself, was, injured, and, died, a, few, days, shortly, after, his, return, to, cuba, this, was, the, europeans, first, encounter, with, a, civilization, in, the, americas, with, buildings, and, complex, social, organizations, that, they, recognized, as, comparable, to, the, old, world, hern, n, cort, s, led, a, new, expedition, to, mexico, landing, ashore, at, present, day, veracruz, on, 22, april, 1519, a, date, which, marks, the, beginning, of, 300, years, of, spanish, hegemony, over, the, region, the, spanish, conquest, of, mexico, denotes, the, conquest, of, the, central, region, of, mesoamerica, where, the, aztec, empire, was, based, the, fall, of, the, aztec, capital, of, tenochtitlan, in, 1521, was, a, decisive, event, but, the, conquest, of, other, regions, of, mexico, such, as, yucat, n, extended, long, after, the, spaniards, consolidated, control, of, central, mexico, the, spanish, conquest, of, yucat, n, was, a, much, longer, campaign, from, 1551, to, 1697, against, the, maya, peoples, of, the, maya, civilization, in, the, yucat, n, peninsula, of, present, day, mexico, and, northern, central, america, smallpox, variola, major, and, variola, minor, began, to, spread, in, mesoamerica, immediately, after, the, arrival, of, europeans, the, indigenous, peoples, who, had, no, immunity, to, it, eventually, died, in, the, millions, a, third, of, all, the, natives, of, the, valley, of, mexico, succumbed, to, it, within, six, months, of, the, spaniards, arrival, tenochtitlan, was, almost, destroyed, by, fire, and, cannon, fire, cort, s, imprisoned, the, royal, families, of, the, valley, to, prevent, another, revolt, he,

spanish, rule, cort, s, immediately, banned, human, sacrifice, throughout, the, conquered, empire, in, 1524, he, requested, the, spanish, king, to, send, friars, from, the, mendicant, orders, particularly, the, franciscan, dominican, and, augustinian, to, convert, the, indigenous, to, christianity, this, has, often, been, called, the, spiritual, conquest, of, mexico, christian, evangelization, began, in, the, early, 1520s, and, continued, into, the, 1560s, many, of, the, mendicant, friars, especially, the, franciscans, and, dominicans, learned, the, native, languages, and, recorded, aspects, of, native, culture, the, spanish, colonizers, introduced, the, encomienda, system, of, forced, labor, indigenous, communities, were, pressed, for, labor, and, tribute, but, were, not, enslaved, their, rulers, remained, indigenous, elites, who, retained, their, status, under, colonial, rule, and, were, useful, intermediaries, the, spanish, also, used, forced, labor, often, outright, slavery, in, mining, the, capture, of, tenochtitlan, marked, the, beginning, of, a, 300, year, colonial, period, during, which, mexico, was, known, as, new, spain, and, ruled, by, a, viceroy, in, the, name, of, the, spanish, monarch, colonial, mexico, had, key, elements, to, attract, spanish, immigrants, dense, and, politically, complex, indigenous, populations, that, could, be, compelled, to, work, and, huge, mineral, wealth, especially, major, silver, deposits, the, viceroyalty, of, peru, shared, these, elements, so, new, spain, and, peru, were, the, seats, of, spanish, power, and, the, source, of, its, wealth, until, other, viceroyalties, were, created, in, spanish, south, america, in, the, late, 18th, century, this, wealth, made, spain, a, dominant, power, in, europe, spain, s, silver, mining, and, crown, mints, created, high, quality, coins, the, currency, of, spanish, america, the, silver, peso, or, spanish, dollar, that, became, a, global, currency, spain, did, not, bring, all, areas, of, the, aztec, empire, under, its, control, after, the, fall, of, tenochtitlan, in, 1521, it, took, decades, of, warfare, to, subdue, the, rest, of, mesoamerica,

rapid, outside, the, zone, of, settled, mesoamerican, civilizations, were, semi, nomadic, northern, peoples, who, fought, fiercely, against, the, spaniards, and, their, indigenous, allies, such, as, the, tlaxcalans, in, the, chichimeca, war, 1550, 1590, the, northern, indigenous, populations, had, gained, mobility, via, the, horses, that, spaniards, had, imported, to, the, new, world, the, region, was, important, to, the, spanish, because, of, its, rich, silver, deposits, the, spanish, mining, settlements, and, trunk, lines, to, mexico, city, needed, to, be, made, safe, for, supplies, to, move, north, and, silver, to, move, south, to, central, mexico, the, most, important, source, of, wealth, was, indigenous, tribute, and, compelled, labor, mobilized, in, the, first, years, after, the, conquest, of, central, mexico, through, the, encomienda, the, encomienda, was, a, grant, of, the, labor, of, a, particular, indigenous, settlement, to, an, individual, spanish, and, his, heirs, spaniards, were, the, recipients, of, traditional, indigenous, products, that, had, been, rendered, in, tribute, to, their, local, lords, and, the, aztec, empire, the, earliest, holders, of, encomiendas, the, encomenderos, were, the, conquerors, involved, in, the, campaign, leading, to, the, fall, of, tenochtitlan, and, later, their, heirs, and, people, with, influence, but, not, conquerors, forced, labor, could, be, directed, toward, developing, land, and, industry, land, was, a, secondary, source, of, wealth, during, this, immediate, conquest, period, where, indigenous, labor, was, absent, or, needed, supplementing, the, spanish, brought, enslaved, people, often, as, skilled, laborers, or, artisans, europeans, africans, and, indigenous, intermixed, creating, a, mixed, race, casta, population, in, a, process, known, as, mestizaje, mestizos, people, of, mixed, european, indigenous, ancestry, constitute, most, of, mexico, s, population, colonial, mexico, was, part, of, the, spanish, empire, and, was, administered, by, the, viceroyalty, of, new, spain, new, spain, became, the, largest, and, most, important, spanish, colony, during, the, 16th, century, spain, focused, on, conquering, areas, with, dense, populations, that, had, produced, pre, columbian, civilizations, these, populations, were, a, labor, force, with, a, history, of, tribute, and, a, population, to, convert, to, christianity, territories, populated, by, nomadic, peoples, were, harder, to, conquer, although, the, spanish, explored, much, of, north, america, seeking, the, fabled, el, dorado, they, made, no, concerted, effort, to, settle, the, northern, desert, regions, in, what, is, now, the, united, states, until, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, santa, fe, 1598, colonial,

based, on, a, racial, separation, of, the, population, among, the, republics, of, spaniards, natives, and, mestizos, autonomous, and, directly, dependent, on, the, king, the, population, of, new, spain, was, divided, into, four, main, groups, or, classes, the, group, a, person, belonged, to, was, determined, by, racial, background, and, birthplace, the, most, powerful, group, was, the, spaniards, people, born, in, spain, and, sent, across, the, atlantic, to, rule, the, colony, only, spaniards, could, hold, high, level, jobs, in, the, colonial, government, the, second, group, called, criollos, were, people, of, spanish, background, but, born, in, mexico, many, criollos, were, prosperous, landowners, and, merchants, even, the, wealthiest, creoles, had, little, say, in, government, the, third, group, the, mestizos, mixed, were, people, who, had, some, spanish, ancestors, and, some, native, ancestors, mestizos, had, a, lower, position, and, were, looked, down, upon, by, the, spaniards, and, the, creoles, the, poorest, most, marginalized, group, in, new, spain, was, the, natives, descendants, of, pre, columbian, peoples, they, had, less, power, and, endured, harsher, conditions, than, other, groups, natives, were, forced, to, work, as, laborers, on, the, ranches, and, farms, called, haciendas, of, the, spaniards, and, creoles, in, addition, to, the, four, main, groups, some, africans, were, in, colonial, mexico, these, africans, were, imported, as, enslaved, people, and, shared, the, low, status, of, the, natives, they, made, up, about, 4, to, 5, of, the, population, and, their, mixed, race, descendants, called, mulattoes, eventually, grew, to, represent, about, 9, from, an, economic, point, of, view, new, spain, was, administered, principally, for,

the, southern, portion, of, new, spain, became, independent, as, well, as, a, result, of, the, treaty, of, c, rdoba, so, central, america, present, day, costa, rica, el, salvador, guatemala, honduras,

that, they, chose, it, initially, the, political, power, of, the, royal, government, was, transferred, to, the, military, the, roman, catholic, church, was, the, other, pillar, of, institutional, rule, both, the, army, and, the, church, lost, personnel, while, establishing, the, new, regime, an, index, of, the, fall, in, the, economy, was, the, decrease, in, revenues, to, the, church, via, the, tithe, a, tax, on, agricultural, output, mining, especially, was, hard, hit, it, had, been, the, motor, of, the, colonial, economy, but, there, was, considerable, fighting, during, the, war, of, independence, in, zacatecas, and, guanajuato, the, two, most, important, silver, mining, sites, despite, viceroy, o, donoj, s, signing, the, treaty, of, c, rdoba, giving, mexico, independence, the, spanish, government, did, not, recognize, it, as, legitimate, and, claimed, sovereignty, over, mexico, spain, set, in, motion, events, that, brought, iturbide, the, son, of, a, provincial, merchant, to, be, the, emperor, of, mexico, with, spain, s, rejection, of, the, treaty, and, no, european, royal, taking, up, the, offer, of, being, mexico, s, monarch, many, creoles, now, decided, that, having, a, mexican, as, its, monarch, was, acceptable, a, local, army, garrison, proclaimed, iturbide, emperor, since, the, church, refused, to, crown, him, the, president, of, the, constituent, congress, did, so, on, 21, july, 1822, his, long, term, rule, was, doomed, he, did, not, have, the, respect, of, the, mexican, nobility, republicans, sought, that, form, of, government, rather, than, a, monarchy, the, emperor, set, up, all, the, trappings, of, a, monarchy, with, a, court, iturbide, became, increasingly, dictatorial, and, shut, down, congress, worried, that, a, young, colonel, antonio, l, pez, de, santa, anna, would, raise, a, rebellion, the, emperor, relieved, him, of, his, command, rather, than, obeying, the, order, santa, anna, proclaimed, a, republic, and, hastily, called, for, the, reconvening, of, congress, four, days, later, he, walked, back, to, his, republicanism, and, called, for, the, removal, of, the, emperor, in, the, plan, of, casa, mata, santa, anna, secured, the, support, of, insurgent, general, guadalupe, victoria, the, army, signed, on, to, the, plan, and, the, emperor, surrendered, on, march, 19, 1823, those, who, overthrew, the, emperor, then, nullified, the, plan, of, iguala, which, had, called, for, a, constitutional, monarchy, and, the, treaty, of, c, rdoba, freeing, them, to, choose, a, new, government, it, was, to, be, a, federal, republic, and, on, 4, october, 1824, the, united, mexican, states, estados, unidos, mexicanos, was, established, the, new, constitution, was, partly, modeled, on, the, constitution, of, the, united, states, it, guaranteed, basic, human, rights, and, defined, mexico, as, a, representative, federal, republic, in, which, the, responsibilities, of, government, were, divided, between, a, central, government, and, several, smaller, units, called, states, it, also, defined, catholicism, as, the, official, and, only, religion, of, the, republic, central, america, did, not, join, the, federated, republic, and, took, a, separate, political, path, from, 1, july, 1823, mexico, s, establishment, of, a, new, form, of, government, did, not, bring, stability, the, civilian, government, contested, political, power, from, the, army, and, the, roman, catholic, church, the, military, and, the, church, retained, special, privileges, called, fueros, general, guadalupe, victoria, was, followed, in, office, by, general, vicente, guerrero, gaining, the, position, through, a, coup, after, losing, the, 1828, elections, the, conservative, party, saw, an, opportunity, to, seize, control, and, led, a, counter, coup, under, general, anastasio, bustamante, who, served, as, president, from, 1830, to, 1832, and, again, from, 1837, to, 1841, in, much, of, spanish, america, soon, after, its, independence, military, strongmen, or, caudillos, dominated, politics, and, this, period, is, often, called, the, age, of, caudillismo, in, mexico, from, the, late, 1820s, to, the, mid, 1850s, the, period, is, often, called, the, age, of, santa, anna, named, for, the, general, and, politician, antonio, l, pez, de, santa, anna, liberals, federalists, asked, santa, anna, to, overthrow, the, conservative, president, anastasio, bustamante, after, he, did, he, declared, general, manuel, g, mez, pedraza, who, won, the, election, of, 1828, president, elections, were, held, after, that, and, santa, anna, took, office, in, 1832, he, served, as, president, for, 11, non, consecutive, terms, constantly, changing, his, political, beliefs, in, 1834, santa, anna, abolished, the, federal, constitution, causing, insurgencies, in, the, southeastern, state, of, yucat, n, and, the, northernmost, portion, of, the, northern, state, of, coahuila, y, tejas, both, areas, sought, independence, from, the, central, government, negotiations, and, the, presence, of, santa, anna, s, army, caused, yucat, n, to, recognize, mexican, sovereignty, then, santa, anna, s, army, turned, to, the, northern, rebellion, the, inhabitants, of, tejas, declared, the, republic, of, texas, independent, from, mexico, on, 2, march, 1836, at, washington, on, the, brazos, they, called, themselves, texans, and, were, led, mainly, by, recent, anglo, american, settlers, at, the, battle, of, san, jacinto, on, april, 21, 1836, texan, militiamen, defeated, the, mexican, army, and, captured, general, santa, anna, the, mexican, government, refused, to, recognize, texas, independence, the, northern, states, grew, increasingly, isolated, economically, and, politically, due, to, prolonged, comanche, raids, and, attacks, the, local, peoples, had, not, recognized, the, spanish, empire, s, claims, to, the, region, nor, did, they, when, mexico, became, an, independent, nation, mexico, attempted, to, convince, its, citizens, to, settle, in, the, region, but, with, few, takers, mexico, negotiated, a, contract, with, anglo, americans, to, settle, in, the, area, hoping, and, expecting, that, they, would, do, so, in, comanche, territory, the, comancheria, in, the, 1820s, when, the, united, states, began, to, influence, the, region, new, mexico, had, already, questioned, its, loyalty, to, mexico, by, the, time, of, the, mexican, american, war, the, comanches, had, raided, and, pillaged, large, portions, of, northern, mexico, resulting, in, sustained, impoverishment, political, fragmentation, and, general, frustration, at, the, inability, or, unwillingness, of, the, mexican, government, to, discipline, the, comanches, in, addition, to, comanche, raids, the, first, republic, s, northern, border, was, plagued, with, attacks, on, its, northern, border, from, the, apache, people, who, were, supplied, with, guns, by, american, merchants, goods, including, guns, and, shoes, were, sold, to, the, apache, the, latter, being, discovered, by, mexican, forces, when, they, found, traditional, apache, trails, with, american, shoe, prints, instead, of, moccasin, prints, after, the, mexican, war, of, independence, the, mexican, government, to, populate, its, northern, territories, awarded, extensive, land, grants, in, coahuila, y, tejas, to, thousands, of, families, from, the, united, states, so, that, the, settlers, convert, to, catholicism, and, become, mexican, citizens, the, mexican, government, also, forbade, the, importation, of, enslaved, people, these, conditions, were, largely, ignored, a, key, factor, in, the, government, s, decision, to, allow, those, settlers, was, the, belief, that, they, would, a, protect, northern, mexico, from, comanche, attacks, and, b, buffer, the, northern, states, against, us, westward, expansion, the, policy, failed, on, both, counts, the, americans, tended, to, settle, far, from, the, comanche, raiding, zones, and, used, the, mexican, government, s, failure, to, suppress, the, raids, as, a, pretext, for, declaring, independence, the, texas, revolution, or, texas, war, of, independence, was, a, military, conflict, between, mexico, and, settlers, in, the, texas, portion, of, the, mexican, state, coahuila, y, tejas, the, war, lasted, from, october, 2, 1835, to, april, 21, 1836, however, war, at, sea, between, mexico, and, texas, continued, into, the, 1840s, the, animosity, between, the, mexican, government, and, the, american, settlers, in, texas, as, well, as, many, texas, residents, of, mexican, ancestry, intensified, with, the, siete, leyes, of, 1835, when, mexican, president, and, general, antonio, l, pez, de, santa, anna, abolished, the, federal, constitution, of, 1824, and, proclaimed, the, more, centralizing, 1835, constitution, in, its, place, war, began, in, texas, on, october, 2, 1835, with, the, battle, of, gonzales, early, texian, army, successes, at, la, bahia, and, san, antonio, were, soon, met, with, crushing, defeat, at, the, same, locations, a, few, months, later, the, war, ended, at, the, battle, of, san, jacinto, where, general, sam, houston, led, the, texian, army, to, victory, over, a, portion, of, the, mexican, army, under, santa, anna, who, was, captured, soon, after, the, battle, the, war, s, end, resulted, in, the, creation, of, the, republic, of, texas, in, 1836, in, 1845, the, u, s, congress, ratified, texas, s, petition, for, statehood, in, response, to, a, mexican, attack, on, a, u, s, army, detachment, in, disputed, territory, the, u, s, congress, declared, war, on, may,

their, college, during, the, battle, of, chapultepec, the, war, ended, with, the, treaty, of, guadalupe, hidalgo, which, stipulated, that, 1, mexico, must, sell, its, northern, territories, to, the, us, for, us, 15, million, 2, the, us, would, give, full, citizenship, and, voting, rights, and, protect, the, property, rights, of, mexicans, living, in, the, ceded, territories, and, 3, the, us, would, assume, 3, 25, million, in, debt, owed, by, mexico, to, americans, mexico, s, defeat, has, been, attributed, to, its, problematic, internal, situation, one, of, disunity, and, disorganization, despite, santa, anna, s, role, in, the, mexican, american, war, catastrophe, he, returned, to, power, again, when, the, u, s, ambitioned, an, easier, railroad, route, to, california, south, of, the, gila, river, santa, anna, sold, the, gadsden, strip, to, the, us, for, 10, million, in, the, gadsden, purchase, in, 1853, this, loss, of, more, territory, provoked, outrage, among, mexicans, but, santa, anna, claimed, that, he, needed, money, to, rebuild, the, army, from, the, war, in, the, end, he, kept, or, squandered, most, of, it, liberals, finally, coalesced, and, successfully, rebelled,

help, the, people, of, mexico, and, his, refusal, to, desert, his, loyal, followers, some, accused, him, of, exploiting, the, nation, s, resources, for, themselves, and, their, allies, including, favoring, the, plans, of, napoleon, iii, to, exploit, the, mines, in, the, northwest, of, the, country, and, to, grow, cotton, maximilian, favored, establishing, a, limited, monarchy, to, share,

benito, ju, rez, as, legitimate, this, left, maximilian, with, few, allies, within, mexico, meanwhile, ju, rez, continued, to, be, recognized, by, the, united, states, which, was, engaged, in, its, civil, war, 1861, 65, and, at, that, juncture, was, in, no, position, to, aid, ju, rez, directly, against, the, french, intervention, until, 1865, france, never, made, a, profit, in, mexico, and, its,

national, base, of, supporters, he, maintained, a, stable, relationship, with, the, catholic, church, by, avoiding, enforcing, constitutional, anticlerical, laws, the, country, s, infrastructure, was,

connected, veterans, of, the, wars, of, the, 1860s, the, political, skills, that, d, az, used, so, effectively, before, 1900, faded, as, he, and, his, closest, advisers, were, less, open, to, negotiations, with, younger, leaders, his, announcement, in, 1908, that, he, would, retire, in, 1911, unleashed, a, widespread, feeling, that, d, az, was, on, the, way, out, and, that, new, coalitions, had, to, be, built, he, nevertheless, ran, for, reelection, and, in, a, show, of, u, s, support, d, az, and, william, taft, planned, a, summit, in, el, paso, texas, and, ciudad, ju, rez,

mexico, the, meeting, focused, attention, on, the, disputed, chamizal, strip, and, resulted, in, assassination, threats, and, other, serious, security, concerns, at, the, meeting, d, az, told, john, hays, hammond, since, i, am, responsible, for, bringing, several, billion, dollars, in, foreign, investments, into, my, country, i, think, i, should, continue, in, my, position, until, a, competent,

ficos, who, were, committed, to, modernity, and, sound, finance, limantour, expanded, foreign, investment, supported, free, trade, balanced, the, budget, for, the, first, time, and, generated, a, budget, surplus, by, 1894, however, he, could, not, halt, the, rising, cost, of, food, which, alienated, the, poor, the, american, panic, of, 1907, was, an, economic, downturn, that, caused, a, sudden, drop, in, demand, for, mexican, copper, silver, gold, zinc, and, other, metals, mexico, cut, its, imports, of, horses, and, mules, mining, machinery, and, railroad, supplies, the, result, was, an, economic, depression, in, mexico, in, 1908, 1909, that, soured, optimism, and, raised, discontent, with, the, d, az, regime, mexico, was, vulnerable, to, external, shocks, because, of, its, weak, banking, system, mexico, had, few, factories, by, 1880, but, industrialization, took, hold, in, the, northeast, especially, in, monterrey, factories, produced, machinery, textiles, and, beer, while,

of, land, in, a, few, families, generated, a, commercial, expansion, that, undercut, the, traditional, powers, of, the, villagers, young, men, felt, insecure, about, the, patriarchal, roles, they, had, expected, to, fill, initially, this, anxiety, manifested, as, violence, within, families, and, communities, but, after, the, defeat, of, d, az, in, 1910, villagers, expressed, their, rage, in, revolutionary, assaults, on, local, elites, who, had, profited, most, from, the, porfiriato, the, young, men, were, radicalized, as, they, fought, for, their, traditional, roles, regarding, land, community, and, patriarchy, the, mexican, revolution, is, a, broad, term, for, political, and, social, changes, in, the, early, 20th, century, most, scholars, consider, it, to, span, the, years, 1910, 1920, from, francisco, i, madero, s, call, for, armed, rebellion, in, the, plan, of, san, luis, potos, until, the, election, of, general, lvaro, obreg, n, in, december, 1920, foreign, powers, had, important, economic, and, strategic, interests, in, the, outcome, of, power, struggles, in, mexico, with, the, united, states, involvement, in, the, mexican, revolution, playing, an, especially, significant, role, the, revolution, grew, increasingly, broad, based, radical, and, violent, revolutionaries, sought, far, reaching, social, and, economic, reforms, by, strengthening, the, state, and, weakening, the, conservative, forces, of, the, church, rich, landowners, and, foreign, capitalists, some, scholars, consider, the, promulgation, of, the, mexican, constitution, of, 1917, as, the, revolution, s, endpoint, economic, and, social, conditions, improved, under, revolutionary, policies, so, that, the, new, society, took, shape, within, a, framework, of, official, revolutionary, institutions, with, the, constitution, providing, that, framework, organized, labor, gained, significant, power, as, seen, in, article, 123, of, the, constitution, of, 1917, land, reform, in, mexico, was, enabled, by, article, 27, economic, nationalism, was, also, enabled, by, article, 27, restricting, ownership, of, enterprises, by, foreigners, the, constitution, restricted, the, catholic, church, implementing, the, restrictions, in, the, late, 1920s, resulted, in, the, cristero, war, the, constitution, and, practice, enshrined, a, ban, on, the, president, s, re, election, political, succession, was, achieved, in, 1929, with, the, creation, of, the, partido, nacional, revolucionario, pnr, this, political, party, dominated, mexico, s, politics, for, the, remainder, of, the, 20th, century, now, called, the, institutional, revolutionary, party, one, major, effect, of, the, revolution, was, the, disappearance, of, the, federal, army, in, 1914, defeated, by, revolutionary, forces, of, the, various, factions, in, the, mexican, revolution, the, mexican, revolution, was, based, on, popular, participation, at, first, it, was, based, on, the, peasantry, who, demanded, land, water, and, a, more, representative, national, government, wasserman, finds, that, popular, participation, in, the, revolution, and, its, aftermath, took, three, forms, first, everyday, people, though, often, in, conjunction, with, elite, neighbors, generated, local, issues, such, as, access, to, land, taxes, and, village, autonomy, second, the, popular, classes, provided, soldiers, to, fight, in, the, revolution, third, local, issues, advocated, by, campesinos, and, workers, framed, national, discourses, on, land, reform, the, role, of, religion, and, many, other, questions, porfirio, d, az, announced, in, an, interview, with, a, us, journalist, james, creelman, that, he, would, not, run, for, president, in, 1910, this, set, off, a, spate, of, political, activity, by, potential, candidates, including, francisco, i, madero, a, member, of, one, of, mexico, s, richest, families, madero, was, part, of, the, anti, reelectionist, party, whose, main, platform, was, the, end, of, the, d, az, regime, but, d, az, reversed, his, decision, to, retire, and, ran, again, he, created, the, office, of, vice, president, which, could, have, been, a, mechanism, to, ease, the, presidential, transition, but, d, az, chose, a, politically, unpalatable, running, mate, ram, n, corral, over, a, popular, military, man, bernardo, reyes, and, a, popular, civilian, francisco, i, madero, he, sent, reyes, on, a, study, mission, to, europe, and, jailed, madero, official, election, results, declared, that, d, az, had, won, almost, unanimously, and, madero, received, only, a, few, hundred, votes, this, fraud, was, too, blatant, and, riots, broke, out, uprisings, against, d, az, occurred, in, the, fall, of, 1910, particularly, in, mexico, s, north, and, the, southern, state, of, morelos, helping, unite, opposition, forces, was, a, political, plan, drafted, by, madero, the, plan, of, san, luis, potos, in, which, he, called, on, the, mexican, people, to, take, up, arms, and, fight, against, the, d, az, government, the, rising, was, set, for, november, 20, 1910, madero, escaped, from, prison, to, san, antonio, texas, where, he, began, preparing, to, overthrow, d, az, an, action, today, considered, the, start, of, the, mexican, revolution, d, az, tried, to, use, the, army, to, suppress, the, revolts, but, most, of, the, ranking, generals, were, old, men, close, to, his, age, and, they, did, not, act, swiftly, or, with, sufficient, energy, to, stem, the, violence, revolutionary, force, led, by, among, others, emiliano, zapata, in, the, south, pancho, villa, and, pascual, orozco, in, the, north, and, venustiano, carranza, defeated, the, federal, army, d, az, resigned, in, may, 1911, for, the, sake, of, the, nation, s, peace, the, terms, of, his, resignation, were, spelled, out, in, the, treaty, of, ciudad, ju, rez, but, it, also, called, for, an, interim, presidency, and, new, elections, to, be, held, francisco, le, n, de, la, barra, served, as, interim, president, the, federal, army, although, defeated, by, the, northern, revolutionaries, was, kept, intact, francisco, i, madero, whose, 1910, plan, of, san, luis, potos, had, helped, mobilize, forces, opposed, to, d, az, accepted, the, political, settlement, he, campaigned, in, the, presidential, elections, of, october, 1911, won, decisively, and, was, inaugurated, in, november, 1911, following, the, resignation, of, d, az, and, a, brief, interim, presidency, of, a, high, level, government, official, from, the, d, az, era, madero, was, elected, president, in, 1911, the, revolutionary, leaders, had, many, different, objectives, revolutionary, figures, varied, from, liberals, such, as, madero, to, radicals, such, as, emiliano, zapata, and, pancho, villa, consequently, it, proved, impossible, to, agree, on, how, to, organize, the, government, that, emerged, from, the, triumphant, first, phase, of, the, revolution, this, standoff, over, political, principles, quickly, led, to, a, struggle, for, government, control, a, violent, conflict, that, lasted, more, than, ten, years, madero, was, ousted, and, killed, in, february, 1913, during, a, coup, d, tat, now, known, as, the, ten, tragic, days, general, victoriano, huerta, one, of, d, az, s, former, generals, and, a, nephew, of, d, az, f, lix, d, az, plotted, with, the, us, ambassador, to, mexico, henry, lane, wilson, to, topple, madero, and, reassert, the, policies, of, d, az, within, a, month, of, the, coup, rebellions, started, spreading, in, mexico, most, prominently, by, the, governor, of, the, state, of, coahuila, venustiano, carranza, along, with, old, revolutionaries, demobilized, by, madero, such, as, pancho, villa, the, northern, revolutionaries, fought, under, the, name, of, the, constitutionalist, army, with, carranza, as, the, first, chief, primer, jefe, in, the, south, emiliano, zapata, continued, his, rebellion, in, morelos, under, the, plan, of, ayala, calling, for, the, expropriation, of, land, and, redistribution, to, peasants, huerta, offered, peace, to, zapata, who, rejected, it, huerta, convinced, pascual, orozco, whom, he, fought, while, serving, the, madero, government, to, join, huerta, s, forces, supporting, the, huerta, regime, were, business, interests, in, mexico, both, foreign, and, domestic, landed, elites, the, roman, catholic, church, and, the, german, and, british, governments, the, federal, army, became, an, arm, of, the, huerta, regime, swelling, to, 200, 000, men, many, pressed, into, service, and, most, ill, trained, the, us, did, not, recognize, the, huerta, government, still, from, february, to, august, 1913, it, imposed, an, arms, embargo, on, exports, to, mexico, exempting, the, huerta, government, and, favoring, the, regime, against, emerging, revolutionary, forces, however, president, woodrow, wilson, sent, a, special, envoy, to, mexico, to, assess, the, situation, and, reports, on, the, many, rebellions, in, mexico, convinced, wilson, that, huerta, was, unable, to, maintain, order, arms, ceased, to, flow, to, huerta, s, government, which, benefited, the, revolutionary, cause, the, us, navy, made, an, incursion, on, the, gulf, coast, occupying, veracruz, in, april, 1914, although, mexico, was, engaged, in, a, civil, war, at, the, time, the, us, intervention, united, mexican, forces, in, their, opposition, to, the, us, foreign, powers, helped, broker, us, withdrawal, in, the, niagara, falls, peace, conference, the, us, timed, its, pullout, to, support, the, constitutionalist, faction, under, carranza, initially, the, forces, in, northern, mexico, were, united, under, the, constitutionalist, banner, with, able, revolutionary, generals, serving, the, civilian, first, chief, carranza, in, the, plan, of, guadalupe, pancho, villa, began, to, split, from, supporting, carranza, as, huerta, was, on, his, way, out, primarily, because, carranza, was, politically, too, conservative, for, villa, carranza, a, rich, hacienda, owner, whose, interests, were, threatened, by, villa, s, more, radical, ideas, opposed, land, reform, zapata, in, the, south, was, also, hostile, to, carranza, due, to, his, stance, on, land, reform, in, july, 1914, huerta, resigned, under, pressure, and, went, into, exile, his, resignation, marked, the, end, of, an, era, since, the, federal, army, a, repeatedly, ineffective, fighting, force, against, the, revolutionaries, ceased, to, exist, with, the, exit, of, huerta, the, revolutionary, factions, decided, to, meet, and, make, a, last, ditch, effort, to, avert, more, intense, warfare, than, that, which, unseated, huerta, called, to, meet, in, mexico, city, in, october, 1914, revolutionaries, opposed, to, carranza, s, influence, successfully, moved, the, venue, to, aguascalientes, the, convention, of, aguascalientes, did, not, reconcile, the, various, victorious, factions, in, the, mexican, revolution, but, was, a, brief, pause, in, revolutionary, violence, the, break, between, carranza, and, villa, became, definitive, during, the, convention, rather, than, first, chief, carranza, being, named, president, of, mexico, general, eulalio, guti, rrez, was, chosen, carranza, and, obreg, n, left, aguascalientes, with, far, smaller, forces, than, villa, s, the, convention, declared, carranza, in, rebellion, against, it, and, civil, war, resumed, this, time, between, revolutionary, armies, that, had, fought, for, a, united, cause, to, oust, huerta, villa, went, into, alliance, with, zapata, to, form, the, army, of, the, convention, their, forces, separately, moved, on, to, the, capital, and, captured, mexico, city, in, 1914, which, carranza, s, forces, had, abandoned, the, famous, picture, of, villa, sitting, in, the, presidential, chair, in, the, national, palace, and, zapata, is, a, classic, image, of, the, revolution, villa, reportedly, told, zapata, that, the, presidential, chair, is, too, big, for, us, the, alliance, between, villa, and, zapata, did, not, function, in, practice, beyond, this, initial, victory, against, the, constitutionalists, zapata, returned, to, his, southern, stronghold, in, morelos, where, he, engaged, in, guerrilla, warfare, under, the, plan, of, ayala, the, two, rival, armies, of, villa, and, obreg, n, met, on, april, 6, 15, 1915, in, the, battle, of, celaya, the, shrewd, modern, military, tactics, of, obreg, n, met, the, frontal, cavalry, charges, of, villa, s, forces, the, constitutionalist, victory, resulted, in, carranza, emerging, as, the, political, leader, of, mexico, villa, retreated, north, seemingly, into, political, oblivion, carranza, and, the, constitutionalists, consolidated, their, position, with, only, zapata, opposing, them, until, his, assassination, in, 1919, venustiano, carranza, promulgated, a, new, constitution, on, february, 5, 1917, the, mexican, constitution, of, 1917, with, significant, amendments, in, the, 1990s, still, governs, mexico, on, 19, january, 1917, a, secret, message, the, zimmermann, telegram, was, sent, from, the, german, foreign, minister, to, mexico, proposing, joint, military, action, against, the, united, states, if, war, broke, out, the, offer, included, material, aid, to, mexico, to, reclaim, the, territory, lost, during, the, mexican, american, war, zimmermann, s, message, was, intercepted, and, published, causing, outrage, in, the, us, and, catalyzing, an, american, declaration, of, war, against, germany, in, early, april, carranza, then, formally, rejected, the, offer, and, the, threat, of, war, with, the, us, eased, carranza,

played, the, part, of, a, substitute, opposition, the, 1924, presidential, election, was, not, a, demonstration, of, free, and, fair, elections, but, the, incumbent, obreg, n, could, not, stand, for,

the, mexican, constitution, of, 1917, and, the, expansion, of, further, anti, clerical, laws, the, formal, rebellions, began, early, in, 1927, with, the, rebels, calling, themselves, cristeros,

the, oil, industry, and, expropriation, of, all, corporate, oil, properties, in, 1938, which, severed, mexico, s, access, to, its, traditional, markets, and, led, mexico, to, sell, its, oil, to, germany, and, italy, most, historians, consider, 1940, a, major, dividing, line, between, the, era, of, military, violence, and, then, political, consolidation, by, military, leaders, of, the,
