the, great, leap, forward, was, an, economic, and, social, campaign, within, the, people, s, republic, of, china, prc, from, 1958, to, 1962, led, by, the, chinese, communist, party, ccp, party, chairman, mao, zedong, launched, the, campaign, to, reconstruct, the, country, from, an, agrarian, economy, into, an, industrialized, society, through, the, formation, of, people, s, communes, millions, of, people, died, in, mainland, china, during, the, great, leap, with, estimates, based, on, demographic, reconstruction, ranging, from, 15, to, 55, million, making, the, great, chinese, famine, the, largest, or, second, largest, famine, in, human, history, the, great, leap, forward, stemmed, from, multiple, factors, including, the, purge, of, intellectuals, the, surge, of, less, educated, radicals, the, need, to, find, new, ways, to, generate, domestic, capital, rising, enthusiasm, about, the, potential, results, mass, mobilization, might, produce, and, reaction, against, the, sociopolitical, results, of, the, soviet, s, development, strategy, mao, ambitiously, sought, an, increase, in, rural, grain, production, and, an, increase, in, industrial, activity, mao, was, dismissive, of, technical, experts, and, basic, economic, principles, which, meant, that, industrialization, of, the, countryside, would, solely, be, dependent, on, the, peasants, grain, quotas, were, introduced, with, the, idea, of, having, peasants, provide, grains, for, themselves, and, support, urban, areas, output, from, the, industrial, activities, such, as, steel, was, also, supposed, to, be, used, for, urban, growth, local, officials, were, fearful, of, anti, rightist, campaigns, and, they, competed, to, fulfill, or, over, fulfill, quotas, which, were, based, on, mao, s, exaggerated, claims, collecting, non, existent, surpluses, and, leaving, farmers, to, starve, to, death, higher, officials, did, not, dare, to, report, the, economic, disaster, which, was, being, caused, by, these, policies, and, national, officials, blaming, bad, weather, for, the, decline, in, food, output, took, little, or, no, action, the, major, changes, which, occurred, in, the, lives, of, rural, chinese, people, included, the, incremental, introduction, of, mandatory, agricultural, collectivization, private, farming, was, prohibited, and, those, people, who, engaged, in, it, were, persecuted, and, labeled, counter, revolutionaries, restrictions, on, rural, people, were, enforced, with, public, struggle, sessions, and, social, pressure, and, forced, labor, was, also, exacted, on, people, rural, industrialization, while, officially, a, priority, of, the, campaign, saw, its, development, aborted, by, the, mistakes, of, the, great, leap, forward, the, great, leap, was, one, of, two, periods, between, 1953, and, 1976, in, which, china, s, economy, shrank, the, other, being, the, cultural, revolution, economist, dwight, perkins, argues, that, enormous, amounts, of, investment, only, produced, modest, increases, in, production, or, none, at, all, in, short, the, great, leap, was, a, very, expensive, disaster, the, ccp, studied, the, damage, that, was, done, at, various, conferences, from, 1960, to, 1962, especially, at, the, seven, thousand, cadres, conference, in, 1962, during, which, mao, zedong, ceded, day, to, day, leadership, to, pragmatic, moderates, like, chinese, president, liu, shaoqi, and, vice, premier, deng, xiaoping, acknowledging, responsibilities, for, the, great, leap, forward, mao, did, not, retreat, from, his, policies, instead, he, blamed, problems, on, bad, implementation, and, rightists, who, opposed, him, he, initiated, the, socialist, education, movement, in, 1963, and, the, cultural, revolution, in, 1966, in, order, to, remove, opposition, and, re, consolidate, his, power, in, addition, dozens, of, dams, constructed, in, zhumadian, henan, during, the, great, leap, forward, collapsed, in, 1975, under, the, influence, of, typhoon, nina, and, resulted, in, the, 1975, banqiao, dam, failure, with, estimates, of, its, death, toll, ranging, from, tens, of, thousands, to, 240, 000, classical, marxist, theory, hypothesized, a, relatively, linear, progression, of, development, and, a, worldwide, revolution, beginning, with, the, most, developed, countries, at, the, founding, of, the, people, s, republic, of, china, in, 1949, the, country, was, one, of, poorest, in, the, world, the, great, leap, forward, attempted, to, defy, the, conventional, understanding, of, the, time, required, for, economic, development, through, rapid, industrialization, it, aimed, to, close, the, gap, between, china, s, developmental, stage, and, its, political, aspirations, in, march, 1955, at, a, national, conference, of, the, party, mao, declared, that, china, would, catch, up, with, and, surpass, the, most, powerful, capitalist, countries, in, several, dozen, years, and, in, october, mao, announced, that, he, would, complete, the, building, of, a, socialist, state, in, 15, years, in, the, late, 1950s, china, s, socio, political, landscape, experienced, significant, rural, reforms, and, the, aftermath, of, previous, policies, aimed, at, collectivization, rather, than, individualism, before, the, great, leap, forward, the, chinese, government, initiated, land, reforms, that, redistributed, land, from, landlords, to, peasants, but, these, reforms, still, needed, to, attain, the, expected, agricultural, productivity, the, early, 1950s, saw, the, establishment, of, agricultural, cooperatives, yet, these, changes, brought, mixed, outcomes, however, the, push, towards, rapid, industrialization, and, the, establishment, of, people, s, communes, in, rural, areas, were, central, to, the, great, leap, forward, reflecting, the, government, s, belief, that, collectivization, and, large, scale, projects, would, boost, agricultural, and, industrial, outputs, the, communes, were, meant, to, centralize, farming, and, labour, supposedly, leading, to, increased, efficiency, and, output, still, in, reality, and, practice, these, measures, often, disrupted, traditional, farming, practices, and, led, to, decreased, productivity, dali, yang, stated, the, initial, stages, of, collectivization, brought, chaos, and, inefficiency, with, agricultural, productivity, often, declining, before, 1949, peasants, had, farmed, their, own, small, pockets, of, land, and, observed, traditional, practices, festivals, banquets, and, paying, homage, to, ancestors, it, was, realized, that, mao, s, policy, of, using, a, state, monopoly, on, agriculture, to, finance, industrialization, would, be, unpopular, with, the, peasants, therefore, it, was, proposed, that, the, peasants, should, be, brought, under, party, control, by, the, establishment, of, agricultural, collectives, which, would, also, facilitate, the, sharing, of, tools, and, draft, animals, this, policy, was, gradually, pushed, through, between, 1949, and, 1958, in, response, to, immediate, policy, needs, first, by, establishing, mutual, aid, teams, of, 5, 15, households, then, in, 1953, elementary, agricultural, cooperatives, of, 20, 40, households, then, from, 1956, in, higher, co, operatives, of, 100, 300, families, from, 1954, onward, peasants, were, encouraged, to, form, and, join, collective, farming, associations, which, would, supposedly, increase, their, efficiency, without, robbing, them, of, their, own, land, or, restricting, their, livelihoods, by, 1958, private, ownership, was, abolished, and, all, households, were, forced, into, state, operated, communes, mao, demanded, that, the, communes, increase, grain, production, to, feed, the, cities, and, to, earn, foreign, exchange, through, exports, apart, from, progressive, taxation, on, each, household, s, harvest, the, state, introduced, a, system, of, compulsory, state, purchases, of, grain, at, fixed, prices, to, build, up, stockpiles, for, famine, relief, and, meet, the, terms, of, its, trade, agreements, with, the, soviet, union, together, taxation, and, compulsory, purchases, accounted, for, 30, of, the, harvest, by, 1957, leaving, very, little, surplus, rationing, was, also, introduced, in, the, cities, to, curb, wasteful, consumption, and, encourage, savings, which, were, deposited, in, state, owned, banks, and, thus, became, available, for, investment, and, although, food, could, be, purchased, from, state, owned, retailers, the, market, price, was, higher, than, that, for, which, it, had, been, purchased, this, too, was, done, in, the, name, of, discouraging, excessive, consumption, besides, these, economic, changes, the, ccp, implemented, major, social, changes, in, the, countryside, including, the, banishing, of, all, religious, and, mystic, institutions, and, ceremonies, replacing, them, with, political, meetings, and, propaganda, sessions, attempts, were, made, to, enhance, rural, education, and, the, status, of, women, allowing, them, to, initiate, divorce, if, they, desired, and, ending, foot, binding, child, marriage, and, opium, addiction, the, old, system, of, internal, passports, the, hukou, was, introduced, in, 1956, preventing, inter, county, travel, without, appropriate, authorization, highest, priority, was, given, to, the, urban, proletariat, for, whom, a, welfare, state, was, created, the, first, phase, of, collectivization, resulted, in, modest, improvements, in, output, famine, along, the, mid, yangzi, was, averted, in, 1956, through, the, timely, allocation, of, food, aid, but, in, 1957, the, party, s, response, was, to, increase, the, proportion, of, the, harvest, collected, by, the, state, to, insure, against, further, disasters, moderates, within, the, party, including, zhou, enlai, argued, for, a, reversal, of, collectivization, on, the, grounds, that, claiming, the, bulk, of, the, harvest, for, the, state, had, made, the, people, s, food, security, dependent, upon, the, constant, efficient, and, transparent, functioning, of, the, government, in, 1957, mao, responded, to, the, tensions, which, existed, in, the, party, by, launching, the, hundred, flowers, campaign, as, a, way, to, promote, free, speech, and, criticism, some, scholars, have, retroactively, concluded, that, this, campaign, was, a, ploy, designed, to, allow, critics, of, the, regime, primarily, intellectuals, but, also, low, ranking, members, of, the, party, who, were, critical, of, the, agricultural, policies, to, identify, themselves, by, the, time, of, the, completion, of, the, first, 5, year, economic, plan, in, 1957, mao, had, come, to, believe, that, the, path, to, socialism, that, had, been, followed, by, the, soviet, union, was, not, appropriate, for, china, he, was, critical, of, khrushchev, s, reversal, of, stalinist, policies, and, he, was, also, alarmed, by, the, uprisings, that, had, taken, place, in, east, germany, poland, and, hungary, and, the, perception, that, the, ussr, was, seeking, peaceful, coexistence, with, the, western, powers, mao, had, become, convinced, that, china, should, follow, its, own, path, to, communism, according, to, jonathan, mirsky, a, historian, and, a, journalist, who, specialized, in, chinese, affairs, china, s, isolation, from, most, of, the, rest, of, the, world, along, with, the, korean, war, had, accelerated, mao, s, attacks, on, his, perceived, domestic, enemies, it, led, him, to, accelerate, his, designs, to, develop, an, economy, where, the, regime, would, get, maximum, benefit, from, rural, taxation, the, anti, rightist, campaign, started, on, june, 8th, 1957, the, main, goal, was, to, purge, rightists, from, the, ccp, and, china, altogether, it, was, believed, that, approximately, 5, percent, of, the, population, was, still, rightists, political, conservatives, sabotaging, the, revolution, in, the, early, years, of, the, new, china, due, to, the, lack, of, experience, in, financial, and, economic, work, it, was, a, common, practice, to, include, the, fiscal, surplus, of, the, previous, year, in, the, budget, of, the, current, year, because, of, the, low, level, of, budgeting, in, the, fiscal, sector, and, inaccurate, estimates, of, economic, development, revenues, and, expenditures, were, underestimated, however, no, problems, arose, because, the, government, usually, managed, to, end, the, fiscal, year, with, a, surplus, in, 1953, when, china, entered, the, first, five, year, plan, period, the, chinese, economy, had, improved, and, the, ministry, of, finance, still, decided, to, include, the, fiscal, surplus, of, the, previous, fiscal, year, as, credit, funds, in, the, 1953, budget, revenue, to, cover, the, current, year, s, expenditures, as, a, result, budget, expenditures, were, expanded, and, so, was, the, size, of, the, budget, at, that, time, only, the, soviet, expert, kutuzov, warned, the, chinese, fiscal, authorities, not, to, use, the, fiscal, surplus, of, the, previous, year, however, it, was, not, heeded, by, the, ministry, of, finance, in, that, year, the, gross, industrial, and, agricultural, output, grew, by, 21, 3, while, the, capital, construction, budget, increased, by, 50, compared, to, the, previous, year, which, led, to, an, imbalance, between, production, and, demand, such, was, the, small, rash, advance, at, the, start, of, the, first, five, year, plan, period, the, issue, had, caused, widespread, social, controversy, the, faction, of, li, xiannian, chen, yun, and, others, did, not, think, it, was, appropriate, to, continue, this, practice, but, they, also, had, opponents, li, xiannian, finally, decided, to, hold, a, collective, meeting, to, discuss, the, issue, and, after, listening, to, the, views, of, all, parties, he, decided, to, abolish, the, practice, nevertheless, the, controversy, over, the, use, of, the, fiscal, surplus, persisted, which, brought, another, reckless, rash, advance, to, china, s, economic, development, in, 1956, at, that, time, china, lacked, consideration, in, three, areas, capital, construction, employee, wages, and, agricultural, loans, making, the, central, treasury, tight, again, this, drew, the, attention, of, zhou, enlai, li, xiannian, and, others, and, at, a, state, meeting, held, on, june, 5, 1956, proposals, were, made, to, curb, impetuousness, and, rash, advances, revise, the, 1956, national, economic, plan, and, cut, capital, construction, investment, such, was, the, anti, rash, advance, movement, the, excess, of, the, first, five, year, plan, gave, the, nation, great, confidence, and, at, the, second, plenary, session, of, the, 8th, central, committee, go, all, out, aim, high, and, build, socialism, with, greater, faster, better, and, more, economical, results, simplified, chinese, traditional, chinese, was, adopted, as, the, general, line, for, socialist, construction, in, china, in, 1955, mao, had, already, expressed, his, belief, that, socialist, construction, should, achieve, greater, faster, better, and, more, economical, results, these, led, to, the, re, emergence, of, rash, advances, which, further, led, to, the, reintroduction, of, policies, and, tendencies, that, had, previously, been, overturned, those, who, opposed, mao, s, policies, were, accused, of, not, upholding, the, tenets, of, the, class, struggle, under, people, s, cult, of, mao, regarding, agriculture, the, chinese, government, recognized, the, country, s, dilemma, of, feeding, its, rapidly, growing, population, without, the, means, to, make, significant, capital, improvements, in, agriculture, viewing, human, labor, as, an, underutilized, factor, of, production, the, government, intensified, the, mobilization, of, masses, of, people, to, increase, labor, inputs, in, agriculture, in, november, 1957, party, leaders, of, communist, countries, gathered, in, moscow, to, celebrate, the, 40th, anniversary, of, the, october, revolution, soviet, communist, party, first, secretary, nikita, khrushchev, proposed, not, only, to, catch, up, with, but, exceed, the, united, states, in, industrial, output, in, the, next, 15, years, through, peaceful, competition, mao, zedong, was, so, inspired, by, the, slogan, that, china, put, forward, its, own, one, to, catch, up, with, and, surpass, the, united, kingdom, in, 15, years, as, with, its, approach, to, agriculture, the, chinese, government, attempted, to, compensate, for, its, inability, to, invest, in, industry, with, mass, mobilizations, to, increase, human, labor, inputs, the, initial, projects, of, the, great, leap, forward, were, accelerating, the, construction, of, waterworks, on, the, north, china, plain, during, the, 1957, 1958, winter, and, next, the, development, of, people, s, communes, and, crude, forms, of, rural, industrialization, some, great, leap, projects, had, lots, of, long, term, value, to, china, s, economy, and, continued, to, benefit, china, after, the, great, leap, forward, ended, some, of, the, projects, included, bridges, railroads, canals, and, reservoirs, however, some, of, these, projects, were, completed, quickly, resulting, in, errors, and, delays, that, did, more, harm, than, good, the, great, leap, forward, campaign, began, during, the, period, of, the, second, five, year, plan, which, was, scheduled, to, run, from, 1958, to, 1963, though, the, campaign, itself, was, discontinued, by, 1961, mao, unveiled, the, great, leap, forward, at, a, meeting, in, january, 1958, in, nanjing, the, great, leap, forward, was, grounded, in, a, logical, theory, of, economic, development, and, represented, an, unambiguous, social, invention, the, central, idea, behind, the, great, leap, was, that, china, should, walk, on, two, legs, by, rapidly, developing, both, heavy, and, light, industry, urban, and, rural, areas, and, large, and, small, scale, labor, the, hope, was, to, industrialize, by, making, use, of, the, massive, supply, of, cheap, labour, and, avoid, having, to, import, heavy, machinery, the, government, also, sought, to, avoid, both, social, stratification, and, technical, bottlenecks, involved, in, the, soviet, model, of, development, but, sought, political, rather, than, technical, solutions, to, do, so, distrusting, technical, experts, mao, and, the, party, sought, to, replicate, the, strategies, used, in, its, 1930s, regrouping, in, yan, an, following, the, long, march, mass, mobilization, social, leveling, attacks, on, bureaucratism, disdain, for, material, obstacles, in, the, absence, of, material, development, inputs, mao, sought, to, increase, development, through, voluntarism, and, organizational, advantages, brought, about, by, socialism, mao, advocated, that, a, further, round, of, collectivization, modeled, on, the, ussr, s, third, period, was, necessary, in, the, countryside, where, the, existing, collectives, would, be, merged, into, huge, people, s, communes, an, experimental, commune, was, established, at, chayashan, in, henan, in, april, 1958, here, for, the, first, time, private, plots, were, entirely, abolished, and, communal, kitchens, were, introduced, at, the, politburo, meetings, in, august, 1958, it, was, decided, that, these, people, s, communes, would, become, the, new, form, of, economic, and, political, organization, throughout, rural, china, by, the, end, of, the, year, approximately, 25, 000, communes, had, been, set, up, with, an, average, of, 5, 000, households, each, the, communes, were, relatively, self, sufficient, co, operatives, where, wages, and, money, were, replaced, by, work, points, the, commune, system, was, aimed, at, maximizing, production, for, provisioning, the, cities, and, constructing, offices, factories, schools, and, social, insurance, systems, for, urban, dwelling, workers, cadres, and, officials, and, also, a, semi, governmental, structure, where, activities, in, the, countryside, could, manage, what, went, on, in, there, people, s, commune, took, care, of, every, aspects, of, people, s, lives, health, care, job, employment, food, housing, finance, defense, culture, education, political, affairs, and, entertainment, people, in, the, communes, were, united, with, the, saying, exceeding, the, uk, catching, the, usa, created, by, mao, to, energize, the, people, and, their, work, ethnics, by, reducing, the, influence, of, western, countries, and, reinforce, his, leadership, legitimacy, citizens, in, rural, areas, who, criticized, the, system, were, labeled, dangerous, later, on, as, more, and, more, families, link, together, to, form, people, s, communes, peasants, started, to, lose, individual, identities, since, families, were, from, vastly, different, communities, with, different, cultures, views, political, views, family, and, financial, background, which, created, conflict, regarding, the, means, and, modes, of, production, some, wealthier, families, who, refused, to, join, a, people, s, commune, might, be, labeled, as, rightists, escape, was, also, difficult, or, impossible, and, those, who, attempted, were, subjected, to, party, orchestrated, public, struggle, which, further, jeopardized, their, survival, besides, agriculture, communes, also, incorporated, some, light, industry, and, construction, projects, harvests, did, increase, however, this, was, because, of, exceptional, weather, not, which, a, lot, of, officials, mistook, as, the, result, of, hard, work, of, the, peasants, creating, further, complications, 106, this, lead, to, famine, in, the, countryside, since, they, were, required, to, reach, set, harvest, goal, leaving, not, enough, food, for, themselves, mao, saw, grain, and, steel, production, as, the, key, pillars, of, economic, development, he, forecast, that, within, 15, years, of, the, start, of, the, great, leap, china, s, industrial, output, would, surpass, that, of, the, uk, in, the, august, 1958, politburo, meetings, it, was, decided, that, steel, production, would, be, set, to, double, within, the, year, most, of, the, increase, coming, through, backyard, steel, furnaces, major, investments, in, larger, state, enterprises, were, made, 1587, 1361, and, 1815, medium, and, large, scale, state, projects, were, started, in, 1958, 1959, and, 1960, respectively, more, in, each, year, than, in, the, first, five, year, plan, millions, of, chinese, became, state, workers, as, a, consequence, of, this, industrial, investment, in, 1958, 21, million, were, added, to, non, agricultural, state, payrolls, and, total, state, employment, reached, a, peak, of, 50, 44, million, in, 1960, more, than, doubling, the, 1957, level, the, urban, population, swelled, by, 31, 24, million, people, these, new, workers, placed, major, stress, on, china, s, food, rationing, system, which, led, to, increased, and, unsustainable, demands, on, rural, food, production, those, between, the, ages, of, sixteen, and, thirty, were, considered, ideal, candidates, for, the, militia, peasants, were, working, long, hours, all, year, round, even, contributed, their, own, cooking, utensils, to, be, melted, as, a, source, of, production, the, consequences, of, the, great, leap, forward, were, devastating, leading, to, one, of, the, most, severe, famines, in, human, history, the, policies, that, diverted, labour, from, agriculture, to, industrial, projects, such, as, backyard, steel, furnaces, resulted, in, a, catastrophic, drop, in, agricultural, output, consequently, food, shortages, became, widespread, according, to, demographic, studies, the, famine, caused, an, estimated, 15, to, 45, million, deaths, with, rural, areas, being, the, hardest, hit, ashton, et, al, 1984, highlight, during, the, period, 1958, 62, about, 30, million, premature, deaths, occurred, in, china, deaths, that, occurred, earlier, than, they, would, have, on, the, basis, of, mortality, trends, for, more, normal, years, during, this, rapid, expansion, coordination, suffered, and, material, shortages, were, frequent, resulting, in, a, huge, rise, in, the, wage, bill, largely, for, construction, workers, but, no, corresponding, increase, in, manufactured, goods, facing, a, massive, deficit, the, government, cut, industrial, investment, from, 38, 9, to, 7, 1, billion, yuan, from, 1960, to, 1962, an, 82, decrease, the, 1957, level, was, 14, 4, billion, partly, due, to, misreporting, or, corruption, at, every, level, of, the, government, where, they, d, overreport, harvest, and, steel, production, by, the, time, people, realized, it, was, too, late, to, correct, statistics, without, angering, mao, the, great, leap, forward, sought, to, revive, folk, technologies, including, in, the, area, of, steel, production, china, s, steel, industry, faced, a, shortage, of, imported, iron, and, calls, to, increase, production, of, native, iron, had, begun, in, 1956, by, mid, 1958, the, chinese, state, began, promoting, indigenous, metallurgical, methods, and, the, proliferation, of, folk, furnaces, mao, was, shown, an, example, of, a, backyard, furnace, in, hefei, anhui, in, september, 1958, by, provincial, first, secretary, zeng, xisheng, the, unit, was, claimed, to, be, manufacturing, high, quality, steel, moreover, the, experience, of, the, intellectual, classes, following, the, hundred, flowers, campaign, silenced, those, aware, of, the, folly, of, such, a, plan, according, to, his, private, doctor, li, zhisui, mao, and, his, entourage, visited, traditional, steel, works, in, manchuria, in, january, 1959, where, he, found, out, that, high, quality, steel, could, only, be, produced, in, large, scale, factories, using, reliable, fuel, such, as, coal, however, he, decided, not, to, order, a, halt, to, the, backyard, steel, furnaces, so, as, not, to, dampen, the, revolutionary, enthusiasm, of, the, masses, the, program, was, only, quietly, abandoned, much, later, in, that, year, on, the, communes, a, number, of, radical, and, controversial, agricultural, innovations, were, promoted, at, the, behest, of, mao, many, of, these, innovations, were, based, on, the, ideas, of, now, discredited, soviet, agronomist, trofim, lysenko, and, his, followers, the, policies, included, close, cropping, whereby, seeds, were, sown, far, more, densely, than, normal, on, the, incorrect, assumption, that, seeds, of, the, same, class, would, not, compete, with, each, other, yang, provides, data, on, the, failure, of, close, planting, techniques, which, reduced, yields, in, anhui, province, from, 400, jin, per, mu, to, less, than, 200, jin, per, mu, due, to, overcrowded,

productive, land, was, left, unplanted, based, on, the, belief, that, concentrating, manure, and, effort, on, the, most, fertile, land, would, lead, to, large, productivity, gains, per, acre, altogether, these, untested, innovations, generally, led, to, decreases, in, grain, production, rather, than, increases, meanwhile, local, leaders, were, pressured, into, falsely, reporting, ever, higher, grain, production, figures, to, their, political, superiors, participants, at, political, meetings, remembered, production, figures, being, inflated, up, to, 10, times, their, actual, production, amounts, as, the, race, to, please, superiors, and, win, plaudits, like, the, chance, to, meet, mao, himself, intensified, the, state, was, later, able, to, force, many, production, groups, to, sell, more, grain, than, they, could, spare, based, on, these, false, production, figures, the, ban, on, private, holdings, severely, disrupted, peasant, life, at, its, most, basic, level, villagers, were, unable, to, secure, enough, food, to, go, on, living, because, they, were, deprived, by, the, commune, system, of, their, traditional, means, of, being, able, to, rent, sell, or, use, their, land, as, collateral, for, loans, in, one, village, once, the, commune, was, operational, the, party, boss, and, his, colleagues, swung, into, manic, action, herding, villagers, into, the, fields, to, sleep, and, to, work, intolerable, hours, and, forcing, them, to, walk, starving, to, distant, additional, projects, edward, friedman, political, scientist, paul, pickowicz, historian, and, mark, selden, sociologist, wrote, about, the, dynamic, of, interaction, between, the, party, and, villagers, beyond, attack, beyond, question, was, the, systemic, and, structured, dynamic, of, the, socialist, state, that, intimidated, and, impoverished, millions, of, patriotic, and, loyal, villagers, the, authors, present, a, similar, picture, to, thaxton, in, depicting, the, party, s, destruction, of, the, traditions, of, chinese, villagers, traditionally, prized, local, customs, were, deemed, signs, of, feudalism, to, be, extinguished, among, them, were, funerals, weddings, local, markets, and, festivals, the, party, thus, destroyed, much, that, gave, meaning, to, chinese, lives, these, private, bonds, were, social, glue, to, mourn, and, to, celebrate, is, to, be, human, to, share, joy, grief, and, pain, is, humanizing, failure, to, participate, in, the, ccp, s, political, campaigns, though, the, aims, of, such, campaigns, were, often, conflicting, could, result, in, detention, torture, death, and, the, suffering, of, entire, families, public, struggle, sessions, were, often, used, to, intimidate, the, peasants, into, obeying, local, officials, they, increased, the, death, rate, of, the, famine, in, several, ways, in, the, first, case, blows, to, the, body, caused, internal, injuries, that, in, combination, with, physical, emaciation, and, acute, hunger, could, induce, death, in, one, case, after, a, peasant, stole, two, cabbages, from, the, common, fields, the, thief, was, publicly, criticized, for, half, a, day, he, collapsed, fell, ill, and, never, recovered, others, were, sent, to, labor, camps, about, 7, of, those, who, died, during, the, great, leap, forward, were, tortured, to, death, or, summarily, killed, benjamin, valentino, notes, that, communist, officials, sometimes, tortured, and, killed, those, accused, of, failing, to, meet, their, grain, quota, however, j, g, mahoney, has, said, that, there, is, too, much, diversity, and, dynamism, in, the, country, for, one, work, to, capture, rural, china, as, if, it, were, one, place, mahoney, describes, an, elderly, man, in, rural, shanxi, who, recalls, mao, fondly, saying, before, mao, we, sometimes, ate, leaves, after, liberation, we, did, not, regardless, mahoney, points, out, that, da, fo, villagers, recall, the, great, leap, forward, as, a, period, of, famine, and, death, and, among, those, who, survived, in, da, fo, were, precisely, those, who, could, digest, leaves, the, failure, of, agricultural, policies, the, movement, of, farmers, from, agricultural, to, industrial, work, and, weather, conditions, suppressed, the, food, supply, at, the, same, time, improvements, in, medicine, infant, mortality, and, average, life, expectancy, promoted, by, the, patriotic, health, campaign, led, to, a, greatly, increased, need, for, food, the, shortage, of, supply, clashed, with, an, explosion, in, demand, leading, to, millions, of, deaths, from, severe, famine, the, economy, which, had, improved, since, the, end, of, the, civil, war, was, devastated, and, in, response, to, the, severe, conditions, there, was, resistance, among, the, populace, the, effects, on, the, upper, levels, of, government, in, response, to, the, disaster, were, complex, with, mao, purging, the, minister, of, national, defense, peng, dehuai, in, 1959, the, temporary, promotion, of, lin, biao, liu, shaoqi, and, deng, xiaoping, and, mao, losing, some, power, and, prestige, following, the, great, leap, forward, during, the, seven, thousand, cadres, conference, in, 1962, which, led, him, to, launch, the, cultural, revolution, in, 1966, despite, the, harmful, agricultural, innovations, the, weather, was, very, favorable, in, 1958, and, the, harvest, was, also, good, however, the, amount, of, labor, which, was, diverted, to, steel, production, and, construction, projects, meant, that, much, of, the, harvest, was, left, to, rot, because, it, was, not, collected, in, some, areas, this, problem, was, exacerbated, by, a, devastating, locust, swarm, which, was, caused, when, their, natural, predators, were, killed, as, part, of, the, four, pests, campaign, although, actual, harvests, were, reduced, local, officials, under, tremendous, pressure, to, report, record, harvests, to, central, authorities, in, response, to, the, innovations, competed, with, each, other, to, announce, increasingly, exaggerated, results, these, results, were, used, as, the, basis, for, determining, the, amount, of, grain, which, would, be, taken, by, the, state, supplied, to, the, towns, and, cities, and, exported, this, barely, left, enough, grain, for, the, peasants, and, in, some, areas, starvation, set, in, a, 1959, drought, and, flooding, from, the, yellow, river, in, the, same, year, also, contributed, to, the, famine, during, 1958, 1960, china, continued, to, be, a, substantial, net, exporter, of, grain, despite, the, widespread, famine, which, was, being, experienced, in, the, countryside, as, mao, sought, to, maintain, face, and, convince, the, outside, world, of, the, success, of, his, plans, foreign, aid, was, refused, when, the, japanese, foreign, minister, told, his, chinese, counterpart, chen, yi, about, an, offer, of, 100, 000, tonnes, of, wheat, which, was, going, to, be, shipped, away, from, public, view, he, was, rebuffed, john, f, kennedy, was, also, aware, that, the, chinese, were, exporting, food, to, africa, and, cuba, during, the, famine, he, said, during, the, news, conference, on, 23, may, 1962, well, there, has, been, no, indication, of, any, expression, of, interest, or, desire, by, the, chinese, communists, to, receive, any, food, from, us, as, i, have, said, at, the, beginning, and, we, would, certainly, have, to, have, some, idea, as, to, whether, the, food, was, needed, and, under, what, conditions, it, might, be, distributed, up, to, the, present, we, have, had, no, such, indication, but, kennedy, said, that, the, us, provided, food, for, about, half, a, million, refugees, in, british, hong, kong, with, dramatically, reduced, yields, even, urban, areas, received, greatly, reduced, rations, however, mass, starvation, was, largely, confined, to, the, countryside, where, as, a, result, of, drastically, inflated, production, statistics, very, little, grain, was, left, for, the, peasants, to, eat, food, shortages, were, bad, throughout, the, country, but, the, provinces, which, had, adopted, mao, s, reforms, with, the, most, vigor, such, as, anhui, gansu, and, henan, tended, to, suffer, disproportionately, sichuan, one, of, china, s, most, populous, provinces, known, in, china, as, heaven, s, granary, because, of, its, fertility, is, thought, to, have, suffered, the, highest, number, of, deaths, from, starvation, due, to, the, vigor, with, which, provincial, leader, li, jingquan, undertook, mao, s, reforms, there, are, widespread, oral, reports, though, little, official, documentation, of, cannibalism, being, practiced, in, various, forms, as, a, result, of, the, famine, author, yan, lianke, also, claims, that, while, growing, up, in, henan, during, the, great, leap, forward, he, was, taught, to, recognize, the, most, edible, kinds, of, bark, and, clay, by, his, mother, when, all, of, the, trees, had, been, stripped, and, there, was, no, more, clay, he, learned, that, lumps, of, coal, could, appease, the, devil, in, his, stomach, at, least, for, a, little, while, the, agricultural, policies, of, the, great, leap, forward, and, the, associated, famine, continued, until, january, 1961, when, at, the, ninth, plenum, of, the, 8th, central, committee, of, the, chinese, communist, party, the, restoration, of, agricultural, production, through, a, reversal, of, the, great, leap, policies, was, started, grain, exports, were, stopped, and, imports, from, canada, and, australia, reduced, the, impact, of, the, food, shortages, at, least, in, the, coastal, cities, the, exact, number, of, deaths, by, famine, is, difficult, to, determine, and, estimates, range, from, 15, million, to, 55, million, people, because, of, the, uncertainties, which, are, involved, in, estimating, the, number, of, deaths, which, were, caused, by, the, failure, of, the, great, leap, forward, and, the, ensuing, famine, and, because, of, the, uncertainties, which, are, involved, in, estimating, the, numbers, of, deaths, which, were, caused, by, other, famines, it, is, difficult, to, compare, the, severity, of, different, famines, if, an, estimate, of, 30, million, deaths, is, accepted, the, failure, of, the, great, leap, forward, caused, the, deadliest, famine, in, the, history, of, china, and, it, also, caused, the, deadliest, famine, in, human, history, this, extremely, high, loss, of, human, lives, was, partially, caused, by, china, s, large, population, to, put, things, into, absolute, and, relative, numerical, perspective, in, the, great, irish, famine, approximately, 1, million, people, out, of, a, total, population, of, 8, million, people, died, or, 12, 5, of, ireland, s, entire, population, if, approximately, 23, million, people, out, of, a, total, population, of, 650, million, people, died, during, the, great, chinese, famine, the, percentage, would, be, 3, 5, hence, the, famine, during, the, great, leap, forward, had, the, highest, absolute, death, toll, though, not, the, highest, relative, percentage, one, the, great, leap, forward, reversed, the, downward, trend, in, mortality, that, had, occurred, since, 1950, though, even, during, the, leap, mortality, may, not, have, reached, pre, 1949, levels, famine, deaths, and, the, reduction, in, number, of, births, caused, the, population, of, china, to, drop, in, 1960, and, 1961, this, was, only, the, third, time, in, 600, years, that, the, population, of, china, had, decreased, mao, zedong, himself, suggested, in, a, discussion, with, field, marshal, montgomery, in, autumn, 1961, that, unnatural, deaths, exceeded, 5, million, in, 1960, 1961, according, to, a, de, classified, cia, report, after, the, great, leap, forward, mortality, rates, decreased, to, below, pre, leap, levels, and, the, downward, trend, begun, in, 1950, continued, the, severity, of, the, famine, varied, from, region, to, region, by, correlating, the, increases, in, the, death, rates, of, different, provinces, peng, xizhe, found, that, gansu, sichuan, guizhou, hunan, guangxi, and, anhui, were, the, hardest, hit, regions, while, heilongjiang, inner, mongolia, xinjiang, tianjin, and, shanghai, experienced, the, lowest, increases, in, death, rates, during, the, great, leap, forward, there, was, no, data, for, tibet, in, some, areas, people, resorted, to, eating, tree, bark, and, dirt, and, in, some, places, cannibalism, as, a, result, of, starvation, peng, also, noted, that, the, increase, in, death, rates, in, urban, areas, was, about, half, the, increase, in, death, rates, in, rural, areas, according, to, chinese, government, reports, in, the, fuyang, party, history, research, office, between, the, years, 1959, and, 1961, 2, 4, million, people, from, fuyang, died, from, the, famine, on, the, other, hand, the, gao, village, in, the, jiangxi, province, there, was, a, famine, but, no, one, actually, died, of, starvation, long, term, impact, the, long, term, impact, of, the, great, leap, forward, extended, beyond, immediate, famine, and, loss, of, life, the, policies, and, their, disastrous, outcomes, led, to, significant, changes, in, chinese, society, and, governance, in, rural, areas, the, effects, on, education, and, women, s, labour, roles, were, profound, the, collapse, of, agricultural, production, systems, and, the, communal, structure, led, to, a, reevaluation, of, economic, strategies, in, subsequent, decades, rural, education, suffered, due, to, the, upheaval, and, while, women, were, initially, mobilized, into, the, workforce, the, ensuing, chaos, often, negated, these, advances, dali, yang, explains, the, great, leap, forward, s, failure, necessitated, significant, policy, shifts, leading, to, a, more, pragmatic, approach, in, china, s, economic, reforms, some, outlier, estimates, include, 11, million, by, utsa, patnaik, an, indian, marxist, economist, 3, 66, million, by, mathematician, sun, jingxian, and, 2, 6, 4, million, by, historian, and, political, economist, yang, songlin, the, number, of, famine, deaths, during, the, great, leap, forward, has, been, estimated, with, different, methods, banister, coale, and, ashton, et, al, compare, age, cohorts, from, the, 1953, 1964, and, 1982, censuses, yearly, birth, and, death, records, and, results, of, the, 1982, 1, 1000, fertility, survey, from, these, they, calculate, excess, deaths, above, a, death, rate, interpolated, between, pre, and, post, leap, death, rates, all, involve, corrections, for, perceived, errors, inherent, in, the, different, data, sets, peng, uses, reported, deaths, from, the, vital, statistics, of, 14, provinces, adjusts, 10, for, under, reporting, and, expands, the, result, to, cover, all, of, china, assuming, similar, mortality, rates, in, the, other, provinces, he, uses, 1956, 57, death, rates, as, the, baseline, death, rate, rather, than, an, interpolation, between, pre, and, post, glf, death, rates, houser, sands, and, xiao, in, their, 2005, research, study, using, provincial, level, demographic, panel, data, and, a, bayesian, empirical, approach, in, an, effort, to, distinguish, the, relative, importance, of, weather, and, national, policy, on, china, s, great, demographic, disaster, conclude, that, in, aggregate, from, 1959, to, 1961, china, suffered, about, 14, 8, million, excess, deaths, of, those, about, 69, or, 10, 3, million, seem, attributable, to, effects, stemming, from, national, policies, cao, uses, information, from, local, annals, to, determine, for, each, locality, the, expected, population, increase, from, normal, births, and, deaths, the, population, increase, due, to, migration, and, the, loss, of, population, between, 1958, and, 1961, he, then, adds, the, three, figures, to, determine, the, number, of, excess, deaths, during, the, period, 1959, 1961, chang, and, halliday, use, death, rates, determined, by, chinese, demographers, for, the, years, 1957, 1963, subtract, the, average, of, the, pre, and, post, leap, death, rates, 1957, 1962, and, 1963, from, the, death, rates, of, each, of, the, years, 1958, 1961, and, multiply, each, yearly, excess, death, rate, by, the, year, s, population, to, determine, excess, deaths, chen, was, part, of, a, large, investigation, by, the, system, reform, institute, think, tank, which, visited, every, province, and, examined, internal, party, documents, and, records, becker, rummel, dik, tter, and, yang, each, compare, several, earlier, estimates, becker, considers, banister, s, estimate, of, 30, million, excess, deaths, to, be, the, most, reliable, estimate, we, have, rummel, initially, took, coale, s, 27, million, as, a, most, likely, figure, then, accepted, the, later, estimate, of, 38, million, by, chang, and, halliday, after, it, was, published, dik, tter, judged, chen, s, estimate, of, 43, to, 46, million, to, be, in, all, likelihood, a, reliable, estimate, he, also, claimed, that, at, least, 2, 5, million, of, these, deaths, were, caused, by, beatings, tortures, or, summary, executions, on, the, other, hand, daniel, vukovich, asserts, that, this, claim, is, coming, from, a, problematic, and, unverified, reference, because, chen, simply, threw, that, number, as, an, estimate, during, an, interview, and, because, chen, hasn, t, published, any, scholarly, work, on, the, subject, yang, takes, cao, s, wang, weizhi, s, and, jin, hui, s, estimates, ranging, from, 32, 5, to, 35, million, excess, deaths, for, the, period, 1959, 1961, adds, his, own, estimates, for, 1958, 0, 42, million, and, 1962, 2, 23, million, based, on, official, figures, reported, by, the, provinces, to, get, 35, to, 37, million, and, chooses, 36, million, as, a, number, that, approaches, the, reality, but, is, still, too, low, estimates, contain, several, sources, of, error, national, census, data, was, not, accurate, and, even, the, total, population, of, china, at, the, time, was, not, known, to, within, 50, to, 100, million, people, the, statistical, reporting, system, had, been, taken, over, by, party, cadre, from, statisticians, in, 1957, making, political, considerations, more, important, than, accuracy, and, resulting, in, a, complete, breakdown, in, the, statistical, reporting, system, population, figures, were, routinely, inflated, at, the, local, level, often, in, order, to, obtain, increased, rations, of, goods, during, the, cultural, revolution, a, great, deal, of, the, material, in, the, state, statistical, bureau, was, burned, according, to, jasper, becker, under, reporting, of, deaths, was, also, a, problem, the, death, registration, system, which, was, inadequate, before, the, famine, was, completely, overwhelmed, by, the, large, number, of, deaths, during, the, famine, in, addition, he, claims, that, many, deaths, went, unreported, so, that, family, members, of, the, deceased, could, continue, to, draw, the, deceased, s, food, ration, and, that, counting, the, number, of, children, who, both, were, born, and, died, between, the, 1953, and, 1964, censuses, is, problematic, however, ashton, et, al, believe, that, because, the, reported, number, of, births, during, the, glf, seems, accurate, the, reported, number, of, deaths, should, be, accurate, as, well, massive, internal, migration, made, both, population, counts, and, registering, deaths, problematic, though, yang, believes, the, degree, of, unofficial, internal, migration, was, small, and, cao, s, estimate, takes, internal, migration, into, account, coale, s, banister, s, ashton, et, al, s, and, peng, s, figures, all, include, adjustments, for, demographic, reporting, errors, though, dik, tter, in, his, book, mao, s, great, famine, argues, that, their, results, as, well, as, chang, and, halliday, s, yang, s, and, cao, s, are, still, underestimates, the, system, reform, institute, s, chen, s, estimate, has, not, been, published, and, therefore, it, cannot, be, verified, the, policies, of, the, great, leap, forward, the, failure, of, the, government, to, respond, quickly, and, effectively, to, famine, conditions, as, well, as, mao, s, insistence, on, maintaining, high, grain, export, quotas, in, the, face, of, clear, evidence, of, poor, crop, output, were, responsible, for, the, famine, there, is, disagreement, over, how, much, if, at, all, weather, conditions, contributed, to, the, famine, significant, amounts, of, agricultural, labor, had, been, transferred, for, steel, production, resulting, in, a, shortage, of, agricultural, workers, approximately, 10, of, crops, could, not, be, harvested, as, a, result, yang, jisheng, a, former, ccp, member, and, former, reporter, for, the, official, chinese, news, agency, xinhua, puts, the, blame, squarely, on, maoist, policies, and, the, political, system, of, totalitarianism, such, as, diverting, agricultural, workers, to, steel, production, instead, of, growing, crops, and, exporting, grain, at, the, same, time, during, the, course, of, his, research, yang, uncovered, that, some, 22, million, tons, of, grain, was, held, in, public, granaries, at, the, height, of, the, famine, reports, of, starvation, went, up, the, bureaucracy, only, to, be, ignored, by, top, officials, and, the, authorities, ordered, that, statistics, be, destroyed, in, regions, where, population, decline, became, evident, using, henan, province, as, an, example, yang, documents, that, inflated, reports, claimed, production, of, 1200, jin, per, mu, while, the, actual, production, was, closer, to, 600, jin, per, mu, resulting, in, excessive, grain, requisitions, and, local, starvation, nearly, 6, of, the, population, passed, away, in, the, later, book, yang, states, 36, million, chinese, starved, to, death, in, the, years, between, 1958, and, 1962, while, 40, million, others, failed, to, be, born, which, means, that, china, s, total, population, loss, during, the, great, famine, then, comes, to, 76, million, economist, steven, rosefielde, argues, that, yang, s, account, shows, that, mao, s, slaughter, was, caused, in, considerable, part, by, terror, starvation, that, is, voluntary, manslaughter, and, perhaps, murder, rather, than, innocuous, famine, yang, claims, that, local, party, officials, were, indifferent, to, the, large, number, of, people, dying, around, them, as, their, primary, concern, was, the, delivery, of, grain, which, mao, wanted, to, use, to, pay, back, debts, to, the, ussr, totaling, 1, 973, billion, yuan, in, xinyang, people, died, of, starvation, at, the, doors, of, grain, warehouses, mao, refused, to, open, the, state, granaries, as, he, dismissed, reports, of, food, shortages, and, accused, the, rightists, and, the, kulaks, of, conspiring, to, hide, grain, from, his, research, into, records, and, talks, with, experts, at, the, meteorological, bureau, yang, concludes, that, the, weather, during, the, great, leap, forward, was, not, unusual, compared, to, other, periods, and, was, not, a, factor, yang, also, believes, that, the, sino, soviet, split, was, not, a, factor, because, it, did, not, happen, until, 1960, when, the, famine, was, well, under, way, mao, s, efforts, to, cool, the, leap, in, late, 1958, met, resistance, within, the, party, and, when, mao, proposed, a, scaling, down, of, steel, targets, many, people, just, wouldn, t, change, and, wouldn, t, accept, it, thus, according, to, historian, tao, kai, the, leap, wasn, t, the, problem, of, a, single, person, but, that, many, people, had, ideological, problems, tao, also, pointed, out, that, everyone, was, together, on, the, anti, rightist, campaign, and, only, a, minority, didn, t, approve, of, the, great, leap, s, policies, or, put, forth, different, opinions, the, actions, of, the, party, under, mao, in, the, face, of, widespread, famine, are, reminiscent, of, soviet, policy, nearly, three, decades, earlier, during, the, soviet, famine, of, 1932, 33, at, that, time, the, ussr, exported, grain, for, international, propaganda, purposes, despite, millions, dying, of, starvation, across, southern, areas, of, the, soviet, union, benjamin, valentino, writes, that, like, in, the, ussr, during, the, famine, of, 1932, 33, peasants, were, confined, to, their, starving, villages, by, a, system, of, household, registration, and, the, worst, effects, of, the, famine, were, directed, against, enemies, of, the, regime, those, labeled, as, black, elements, religious, leaders, rightists, rich, peasants, etc, in, any, previous, campaign, were, given, the, lowest, priority, in, the, allocation, of, food, and, therefore, died, in, the, greatest, numbers, drawing, from, jasper, becker, s, book, hungry, ghosts, genocide, scholar, adam, jones, states, that, no, group, suffered, more, than, the, tibetans, from, 1959, to, 1962, ashton, et, al, write, that, policies, leading, to, food, shortages, natural, disasters, and, a, slow, response, to, initial, indications, of, food, shortages, were, to, blame, for, the, famine, policies, leading, to, food, shortages, included, the, implementation, of, the, commune, system, and, an, emphasis, on, non, agricultural, activities, such, as, backyard, steel, production, natural, disasters, included, drought, flood, typhoon, plant, disease, and, insect, pest, the, slow, response, was, in, part, due, to, a, lack, of, objective, reporting, on, the, agricultural, situation, including, a, nearly, complete, breakdown, in, the, agricultural, reporting, system, this, was, partly, caused, by, strong, incentives, for, officials, to, over, report, crop, yields, according, to, frank, dik, tter, local, officials, frequently, reported, production, figures, 30, 40, higher, than, the, actual, output, to, meet, the, central, government, s, ambitious, targets, the, unwillingness, of, the, central, government, to, seek, international, aid, was, a, major, factor, china, s, net, grain, exports, in, 1959, and, 1960, would, have, been, enough, to, feed, 16, million, people, 2000, calories, per, day, ashton, et, al, conclude, that, it, would, not, be, inaccurate, to, say, that, 30, million, people, died, prematurely, as, a, result, of, errors, of, internal, policy, and, flawed, international, relations, mobo, gao, suggested, that, the, great, leap, forward, s, terrible, effects, came, not, from, malignant, intent, on, the, part, of, the, chinese, leadership, at, the, time, but, instead, related, to, the, structural, nature, of, its, rule, and, the, vastness, of, china, as, a, country, gao, says, the, terrible, lesson, learnt, is, that, china, is, so, huge, and, when, it, is, uniformly, ruled, follies, or, wrong, policies, will, have, grave, implications, of, tremendous, magnitude, as, of, 2012, the, chinese, government, s, official, english, web, portal, places, the, responsibility, for, the, serious, losses, to, country, and, people, of, 1959, 1961, without, mentioning, famine, mainly, on, the, great, leap, forward, and, the, anti, rightist, struggle, and, lists, weather, and, cancellation, of, contracts, by, the, soviet, union, as, contributing, factors, not, all, deaths, during, the, great, leap, were, from, starvation, in, accounts, documented, by, yang, jisheng, people, were, beaten, or, killed, for, rebelling, against, the, government, reporting, the, real, harvest, numbers, for, sounding, alarm, for, refusing, to, hand, over, what, little, food, they, had, left, for, trying, to, flee, the, famine, area, for, begging, for, food, or, as, little, as, stealing, scraps, or, angering, officials, in, the, book, tombstone, a, cycle, of, starvation, and, violence, was, documented, during, the, great, leap, forward, in, agrarian, policy, the, failures, of, food, supply, during, the, great, leap, were, met, by, a, gradual, de, collectivization, over, the, course, of, the, 1960s, that, foreshadowed, the, further, measures, taken, under, deng, xiaoping, political, scientist, meredith, jung, en, woo, argues, unquestionably, the, regime, failed, to, respond, in, time, to, save, the, lives, of, millions, of, peasants, but, when, it, did, respond, it, ultimately, transformed, the, livelihoods, of, several, hundred, million, peasants, modestly, in, the, early, 1960s, but, permanently, after, deng, xiaoping, s, reforms, subsequent, to, 1978, despite, the, risks, to, their, careers, some, ccp, members, openly, laid, blame, for, the, disaster, at, the, feet, of, the, party, leadership, and, took, it, as, proof, that, china, must, rely, more, on, education, acquiring, technical, expertise, and, applying, bourgeois, methods, in, developing, the, economy, liu, shaoqi, made, a, speech, at, the, seven, thousand, cadres, conference, in, 1962, stating, that, economic, disaster, was, 30, fault, of, nature, 70, human, error, a, 2017, paper, by, economists, found, strong, evidence, that, the, unrealistic, yield, targets, led, to, excessive, death, tolls, from, 1959, to, 1961, and, further, analysis, shows, that, yield, targets, induced, the, inflation, of, grain, output, figures, and, excessive, procurement, we, also, find, that, mao, s, radical, policy, caused, serious, deterioration, in, human, capital, accumulation, and, slower, economic, development, in, the, policy, affected, regions, decades, after, the, death, of, mao, a, dramatic, decline, in, grain, output, continued, for, several, years, involving, in, 1960, 61, a, drop, in, output, of, more, than, 25, percent, causes, of, this, drop, are, found, in, both, natural, disaster, and, government, policy, overall, the, great, leap, forward, failed, to, rapidly, industrialize, china, as, intended, according, to, joseph, ball, writing, in, the, monthly, review, there, is, a, good, argument, to, suggest, that, the, policies, of, the, great, leap, forward, did, a, lot, to, sustain, china, s, overall, economic, growth, after, an, initial, period, of, disruption, official, chinese, statistics, show, that, after, the, end, of, the, leap, in, 1962, industrial, output, value, had, doubled, the, gross, value, of, agricultural, products, increased, by, 35, percent, steel, production, in, 1962, was, between, 10, 6, million, tons, or, 12, million, tons, investment, in, capital, construction, rose, to, 40, percent, from, 35, percent, in, the, first, five, year, plan, period, the, investment, in, capital, construction, was, doubled, and, the, average, income, of, workers, and, farmers, increased, by, up, to, 30, percent, additionally, there, was, significant, capital, construction, especially, in, iron, steel, mining, and, textile, enterprises, that, ultimately, contributed, greatly, to, china, s, industrialization, the, great, leap, forward, period, also, marked, the, initiation, of, china, s, rapid, growth, in, tractor, and, fertilizer, production, the, successful, construction, of, the, daqing, oil, field, despite, harsh, weather, conditions, and, supply, limitations, became, a, model, held, up, by, the, party, as, an, example, during, subsequent, industrialization, campaigns, during, its, 1960, construction, oil, minister, yu, qiuli, mobilized, workers, through, ideological, motivation, instead, of, material, incentives, focusing, enthusiasm, energy, and, resources, to, complete, a, rapid, industrialization, project, the, project, also, delivered, critical, economic, benefits, because, without, the, production, of, the, daqing, oil, field, crude, oil, would, have, been, severely, limited, after, the, soviet, union, cut, off, supplies, as, a, result, of, the, sino, soviet, split, large, scale, irrigation, projects, begun, during, the, late, 1950s, as, part, of, the, great, leap, forward, continued, to, grow, rapidly, until, the, late, 1970s, the, initial, impact, of, the, great, leap, forward, was, discussed, at, the, lushan, conference, in, july, august, 1959, although, many, of, the, more, moderate, leaders, had, reservations, about, the, new, policy, the, only, senior, leader, to, speak, out, openly, was, marshal, peng, dehuai, mao, responded, to, peng, s, criticism, of, the, great, leap, by, dismissing, peng, from, his, post, as, defence, minister, denouncing, peng, who, came, from, a, poor, peasant, family, and, his, supporters, as, bourgeois, and, launching, a, nationwide, campaign, against, rightist, opportunism, peng, was, replaced, by, lin, biao, who, began, a, systematic, purge, of, peng, s, supporters, from, the, military, the, great, leap, forward, s, focus, on, total, workforce, mobilization, resulted, in, opportunities, for, women, s, labor, advancement, increasing, collectivization, of, labor, brought, more, opportunities, for, women, to, leave, the, home, thereby, increasing, their, economic, and, personal, independence, the, number, of, women, in, state, institutions, and, state, owned, enterprises, more, than, tripled, during, the, period, 1957, to, 1960, as, women, became, increasingly, needed, to, work, in, agriculture, and, industry, and, encouraged, by, policy, to, do, so, the, phenomenon, of, iron, women, arose, women, did, traditionally, male, work, in, both, fields, and, factories, including, major, movements, of, women, into, management, positions, women, competed, for, high, productivity, and, those, who, distinguished, themselves, came, to, be, called, iron, women, slogans, such, as, there, is, no, difference, between, men, and, women, in, this, new, age, and, we, can, do, anything, and, anything, we, do, we, can, do, it, well, became, popular, neighborhood, production, teams, established, during, this, period, offered, women, labor, that, allowed, them, to, leave, the, home, without, leaving, the, neighborhood, community, this, mode, of, labor, provided, urban, women, with, the, right, to, work, while, still, preserving, existing, forms, of, household, social, life, during, the, great, leap, forward, the, number, of, universities, in, china, increased, to, 1, 289, by, 1960, and, nationwide, enrollment, more, than, doubled, to, 962, 000, in, 1960, this, was, a, wave, of, great, leap, forward, in, higher, education, many, of, the, newly, established, universities, however, were, affiliated, with, people, s, communes, and, were, directly, transformed, from, local, middle, schools, for, example, in, xushui, county, of, hebei, province, every, commune, built, one, university, of, its, own, and, local, middle, school, teachers, were, promoted, to, professors, for, another, example, in, suiping, county, of, henan, province, a, new, university, was, established, with, 10, departments, and, 529, students, where, some, professors, were, actually, teachers, from, local, elementary, school, according, to, official, sources, some, comrades, expressed, the, fear, that, the, movement, would, be, a, mockery, of, school, education, with, regard, to, the, development, of, higher, education, some, comrades, hearing, that, peasants, have, set, up, their, own, universities, in, the, countryside, would, ridicule, the, idea, believing, that, a, university, without, a, staff, of, qualified, professors, and, students, who, have, graduated, from, senior, middle, schools, cannot, be, called, a, university, educational, reforms, during, the, great, leap, forward, sought, to, increase, student, and, staff, participation, in, the, administration, process, to, favor, students, from, worker, peasant, or, soldier, backgrounds, in, admissions, and, to, increase, the, role, of, the, ccp, and, of, politics, in, schools, beginning, in, 1961, universities, rolled, back, these, policy, initiatives, and, increase, meritocratic, university, policies, instead, of, egalitarian, ones, there, were, various, forms, of, resistance, to, the, consequences, of, the, great, leap, forward, several, provinces, saw, armed, rebellion, though, these, rebellions, never, posed, a, serious, threat, to, the, central, government, rebellions, are, documented, to, have, occurred, in, henan, shandong, qinghai, gansu, sichuan, fujian, and, yunnan, provinces, and, in, the, tibetan, autonomous, region, in, henan, shandong, qinghai, gansu, and, sichuan, these, rebellions, lasted, more, than, a, year, with, the, spirit, soldier, rebellion, of, 1959, being, one, of, the, few, larger, scale, uprisings, there, was, also, occasional, violence, against, cadre, members, raids, on, granaries, arson, and, other, vandalism, train, robberies, and, raids, on, neighboring, villages, and, counties, were, common, according, to, ralph, thaxton, professor, of, politics, at, brandeis, university, villagers, turned, against, the, ccp, during, and, after, the, great, leap, seeing, it, as, autocratic, brutal, corrupt, and, mean, spirited, according, to, thaxton, the, ccp, s, policies, included, plunder, forced, labor, and, starvation, which, led, villagers, to, think, about, their, relationship, with, the, communist, party, in, ways, that, do, not, bode, well, for, the, continuity, of, socialist, rule, often, villagers, composed, doggerel, to, show, their, defiance, to, the, regime, and, perhaps, to, remain, sane, during, the, great, leap, one, jingle, ran, flatter, shamelessly, eat, delicacies, don, t, flatter, starve, to, death, for, sure, officials, were, prosecuted, for, exaggerating, production, figures, although, punishments, varied, in, one, case, a, provincial, party, secretary, was, dismissed, and, prohibited, from, holding, higher, office, a, number, of, county, level, officials, were, publicly, tried, and, executed, mao, stepped, down, as, state, chairman, of, the, prc, on, april, 27, 1959, but, remained, ccp, chairman, liu, shaoqi, the, new, prc, chairman, and, reformist, deng, xiaoping, ccp, general, secretary, were, left, in, charge, to, change, policy, to, bring, economic, recovery, mao, s, great, leap, forward, policy, was, openly, criticized, at, the, lushan, party, conference, by, one, person, criticism, from, minister, of, national, defense, peng, dehuai, who, discovered, that, people, from, his, home, province, starved, to, death, caused, him, to, write, a, letter, to, mao, to, ask, for, the, policies, to, be, adapted, after, the, lushan, showdown, mao, replaced, peng, with, lin, biao, and, peng, was, sent, off, into, obscurity, however, by, 1962, it, was, clear, that, the, party, had, changed, away, from, the, extremist, ideology, that, led, to, the, great, leap, during, 1962, the, party, held, a, number, of, conferences, and, rehabilitated, most, of, the, deposed, comrades, who, had, criticized, mao, in, the, aftermath, of, the, great, leap, the, event, was, again, discussed, with, much, self, criticism, and, the, contemporary, government, called, it, a, serious, to, our, country, and, people, and, blamed, the, cult, of, personality, of, mao, at, the, lushan, conference, of, 1959, peng, dehuai, one, of, the, great, marshals, of, the, chinese, civil, war, against, the, nationalists, was, a, strong, supporter, of, the, leap, but, the, discovery, that, people, from, his, own, home, area, were, starving, to, death, prompted, him, to, write, to, mao, to, ask, for, the, policies, to, be, adapted, mao, was, furious, reading, the, letter, out, in, public, and, demanding, that, his, colleagues, in, the, leadership, line, up, either, behind, him, or, peng, almost, to, a, man, they, supported, mao, with, his, security, chief, kang, sheng, declaring, of, the, letter, i, make, bold, to, suggest, that, this, cannot, be, handled, with, lenience, in, particular, at, the, seven, thousand, cadres, conference, in, january, february, 1962, mao, made, a, self, criticism, and, re, affirmed, his, commitment, to, democratic, centralism, in, the, years, that, followed, mao, mostly, abstained, from, the, operations, of, government, making, policy, largely, the, domain, of, liu, shaoqi, and, deng, xiaoping, maoist, ideology, took, a, back, seat, in, the, ccp, until, mao, launched, the, cultural, revolution, in, 1966, which, marked, his, political, comeback, following, the, failures, of, the, great, leap, forward, chinese, leadership, slowed, the, pace, of, industrialization, focusing, more, on, the, development, of, china, s, already, more, developed, coastal, areas, and, the, production, of, consumer, goods, thus, during, the, preliminary, formulation, of, the, third, five, year, plan, which, had, been, delayed, due, to, the, economic, turmoil, liu, stated, in, the, past, the, infrastructure, battlefront, was, too, long, there, were, too, many, projects, demands, were, too, high, and, rushed, designs, were, done, badly, and, projects, were, hurriedly, begun, we, only, paid, attention, to, increasing, output, and, ignored, quality, we, set, targets, too, highly, we, must, always, remember, these, painful, learning, experiences, during, the, discussion, of, the, third, five, year, plan, mao, made, similar, statements, about, the, great, leap, forward, having, extended, the, infrastructure, battlefront, too, long, acknowledging, that, it, was, best, to, do, less, and, well, the, failures, of, the, great, leap, forward, also, informed, the, government, s, approach, to, the, third, front, construction, campaign, which, followed, a, few, years, later, and, which, built, basic, industry, and, national, defense, industry, in, china, s, interior, rather, than, adopting, the, great, leap, forward, s, approach, of, locally, developed, projects, the, mass, mobilizations, of, the, third, front, were, centrally, planned, in, addition, according, to, historian, philipp, brigham, the, failures, of, the, great, leap, forward, significantly, contributed, to, the, cultural, revolution, which, is, another, pivotal, event, in, modern, chinese, politics, that, happened, later, in, chairman, mao, s, regime, specifically, he, posits, that, one, of, the, main, objectives, of, the, cultural, revolution, was, to, extricate, chairman, mao, and, the, central, committee, of, the, chinese, communist, party, from, the, responsibility, for, the, great, leap, forward, according, to, brigham, s, explanation, chairman, mao, and, the, central, committee, tried, to, incite, through, the, cultural, revolution, that, the, great, leap, forward, had, failed, despite, the, right, direction, from, above, due, to, inadequate, leadership, of, the, local, cadres, the, great, leap, forward, resulted, in, ecological, impacts, through, deforestation, that, resulted, as, well, as, the, expansion, of, agriculture, into, areas, ill, suited, for, it, there, is, evidence, that, survivors, of, the, famine, suffered, sustained, negative, effects, to, their, long, term, health, and, economic, outcomes, those, in, early, childhood, during, the, famine, were, impacted, the, most, and, it, has, been, estimated, that, the, 1959, birth, cohort, would, have, otherwise, grown, 3cm, taller, in, adulthood, cohorts, born, during, the, famine, showed, higher, infant, and, early, life, mortality, but, exhibit, a, mortality, crossover, pattern, with, mortality, rates, leveling, off, or, even, dropping, relative, to, non, famine, cohorts, beyond, a, certain, point, this, could, be, explained, by, the, combined, effects, of, initial, debilitation, in, which, malnutrition, and, hardship, increase, early, deaths, and, selection, for, robustness, among, famine, survivors, resulting, in, fewer, later, deaths, consistent, with, the, great, leap, forward, in, agriculture, and, industry, authorities, promoted, the, new, folksong, movement, and, the, peasant, painting, movement, from, which, hundreds, of, thousands, of, new, artists, emerged, through, the, new, folksong, movement, millions, of, new, folk, songs, and, poems, were, written, and, collected, as, part, of, the, peasant, painting, movement, peasant, artists, decorated, village, walls, with, great, leap, forward, themed, murals, the, great, leap, forward, also, prompted, a, wave, of, the, new, guohua, campaign, in, which, the, state, commissioned, landscape, artists, to, paint, new, production, projects, select, paintings, of, the, campaign, were, taught, in, schools, published, widely, as, propaganda, posters, exhibited, in, museums, and, used, as, the, backdrops, of, state, events, on, march, 9, 1958, the, ministry, of, culture, held, a, meeting, to, introduce, a, great, leap, forward, in, cinema, during, the, great, leap, forward, the, film, industry, rapidly, expanded, with, documentary, films, being, the, genre, that, experienced, the, greatest, growth, the, total, number, of, film, screening, venues, including, both, urban, cinemas, and, mobile,
