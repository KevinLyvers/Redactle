the, norman, conquest, or, the, conquest, was, the, 11th, century, invasion, and, occupation, of, england, by, an, army, made, up, of, thousands, of, norman, french, flemish, and, breton, troops, all, led, by, the, duke, of, normandy, later, styled, william, the, conqueror, william, s, claim, to, the, english, throne, derived, from, his, familial, relationship, with, the, childless, anglo, saxon, king, edward, the, confessor, who, may, have, encouraged, william, s, hopes, for, the, throne, edward, died, in, january, 1066, and, was, succeeded, by, his, brother, in, law, harold, godwinson, the, norwegian, king, harald, hardrada, invaded, northern, england, in, september, 1066, and, was, victorious, at, the, battle, of, fulford, on, 20, september, but, godwinson, s, army, defeated, and, killed, hardrada, at, the, battle, of, stamford, bridge, on, 25, september, three, days, later, on, 28, september, william, s, invasion, force, of, thousands, of, men, and, hundreds, of, ships, landed, at, pevensey, in, sussex, in, southern, england, harold, marched, south, to, oppose, him, leaving, a, significant, portion, of, his, army, in, the, north, harold, s, army, confronted, william, s, invaders, on, 14, october, at, the, battle, of, hastings, william, s, force, defeated, harold, who, was, killed, in, the, engagement, and, william, became, king, although, william, s, main, rivals, were, gone, he, still, faced, rebellions, over, the, following, years, and, was, not, secure, on, the, english, throne, until, after, 1072, the, lands, of, the, resisting, english, elite, were, confiscated, some, of, the, elite, fled, into, exile, to, control, his, new, kingdom, william, granted, lands, to, his, followers, and, built, castles, commanding, military, strong, points, throughout, the, land, the, domesday, book, a, manuscript, record, of, the, great, survey, of, much, of, england, and, parts, of, wales, was, completed, by, 1086, other, effects, of, the, conquest, included, the, court, and, government, the, introduction, of, a, dialect, of, french, as, the, language, of, the, elites, and, changes, in, the, composition, of, the, upper, classes, as, william, enfeoffed, lands, to, be, held, directly, from, the, king, more, gradual, changes, affected, the, agricultural, classes, and, village, life, the, main, change, appears, to, have, been, the, formal, elimination, of, slavery, which, may, or, may, not, have, been, linked, to, the, invasion, there, was, little, alteration, in, the, structure, of, government, as, the, new, norman, administrators, took, over, many, of, the, forms, of, anglo, saxon, government, in, 911, the, carolingian, french, ruler, charles, the, simple, allowed, a, group, of, vikings, under, their, leader, rollo, to, settle, in, normandy, as, part, of, the, treaty, of, saint, clair, sur, epte, in, exchange, for, the, land, the, norsemen, under, rollo, were, expected, to, provide, protection, along, the, coast, against, further, viking, invaders, their, settlement, proved, successful, and, the, vikings, in, the, region, became, known, as, the, northmen, which, normandy, and, normans, are, derived, from, the, normans, quickly, adopted, the, indigenous, culture, as, they, became, assimilated, by, the, french, renouncing, paganism, and, converting, to, christianity, they, adopted, the, old, french, language, of, their, new, home, and, added, features, from, their, own, old, norse, language, transforming, it, into, the, norman, language, they, intermarried, with, the, local, population, and, used, the, territory, granted, to, them, as, a, base, to, extend, the, frontiers, of, the, duchy, westward, annexing, territory, including, the, bessin, the, cotentin, peninsula, and, avranches, in, 1002, english, king, thelred, the, unready, married, emma, of, normandy, the, sister, of, richard, ii, duke, of, normandy, their, son, edward, the, confessor, who, spent, many, years, in, exile, in, normandy, succeeded, to, the, english, throne, in, 1042, this, led, to, the, establishment, of, a, powerful, norman, interest, in, english, politics, as, edward, drew, heavily, on, his, former, hosts, for, support, bringing, in, norman, courtiers, soldiers, and, clerics, and, appointing, them, to, positions, of, power, particularly, in, the, church, childless, and, embroiled, in, conflict, with, the, formidable, godwin, earl, of, wessex, and, his, sons, edward, may, also, have, encouraged, duke, william, of, normandy, s, ambitions, for, the, english, throne, when, king, edward, died, at, the, beginning, of, 1066, the, lack, of, a, clear, heir, led, to, a, disputed, succession, in, which, several, contenders, laid, claim, to, the, throne, of, england, edward, s, immediate, successor, was, the, earl, of, wessex, harold, godwinson, the, richest, and, most, powerful, of, the, english, aristocrats, harold, was, elected, king, by, the, witenagemot, of, england, and, crowned, by, the, archbishop, of, york, ealdred, although, norman, propaganda, claimed, the, ceremony, was, performed, by, stigand, the, uncanonically, elected, archbishop, of, canterbury, harold, was, immediately, challenged, by, two, powerful, neighbouring, rulers, duke, william, claimed, that, he, had, been, promised, the, throne, by, king, edward, and, that, harold, had, sworn, agreement, to, this, king, harald, iii, of, norway, commonly, known, as, harald, hardrada, also, contested, the, succession, his, claim, to, the, throne, was, based, on, an, agreement, between, his, predecessor, magnus, the, good, and, the, earlier, english, king, harthacnut, whereby, if, either, died, without, an, heir, the, other, would, inherit, both, england, and, norway, william, and, harald, at, once, set, about, assembling, troops, and, ships, to, invade, england, in, early, 1066, harold, s, exiled, brother, tostig, godwinson, raided, southeastern, england, with, a, fleet, he, had, recruited, in, flanders, later, joined, by, other, ships, from, orkney, threatened, by, harold, s, fleet, tostig, moved, north, and, raided, in, east, anglia, and, lincolnshire, but, he, was, driven, back, to, his, ships, by, the, brothers, edwin, earl, of, mercia, and, morcar, earl, of, northumbria, deserted, by, most, of, his, followers, tostig, withdrew, to, scotland, where, he, spent, the, summer, recruiting, fresh, forces, king, harold, spent, the, summer, on, the, south, coast, with, a, large, army, and, fleet, waiting, for, william, to, invade, but, the, bulk, of, his, forces, were, militia, who, needed, to, harvest, their, crops, so, on, 8, september, harold, dismissed, them, hardrada, invaded, northern, england, in, early, september, leading, a, fleet, of, more, than, 300, ships, carrying, perhaps, 15, 000, men, harald, s, army, was, further, augmented, by, the, forces, of, tostig, who, threw, his, support, behind, the, norwegian, king, s, bid, for, the, throne, advancing, on, york, the, norwegians, defeated, a, northern, english, army, under, edwin, and, morcar, on, 20, september, at, the, battle, of, fulford, the, two, earls, had, rushed, to, engage, the, norwegian, forces, before, harold, could, arrive, from, the, south, although, harold, godwinson, had, married, edwin, and, morcar, s, sister, ealdgyth, the, two, earls, may, have, distrusted, harold, and, feared, that, the, king, would, replace, morcar, with, tostig, the, result, was, that, their, forces, were, devastated, and, unable, to, participate, in, the, rest, of, the, campaigns, of, 1066, although, the, two, earls, survived, the, battle, hardrada, moved, on, to, york, which, surrendered, to, him, after, taking, hostages, from, the, leading, men, of, the, city, on, 24, september, the, norwegians, moved, east, to, the, tiny, village, of, stamford, bridge, king, harold, probably, learned, of, the, norwegian, invasion, in, mid, september, and, rushed, north, gathering, forces, as, he, went, the, royal, forces, probably, took, nine, days, to, cover, the, distance, from, london, to, york, averaging, almost, 25, miles, 40, kilometres, per, day, at, dawn, on, 25, september, harold, s, forces, reached, york, where, he, learned, the, location, of, the, norwegians, the, english, then, marched, on, the, invaders, and, took, them, by, surprise, defeating, them, in, the, battle, of, stamford, bridge, harald, of, norway, and, tostig, were, killed, and, the, norwegians, suffered, such, horrific, losses, that, only, 24, of, the, original, 300, ships, were, required, to, carry, away, the, survivors, the, english, victory, was, costly, however, as, harold, s, army, was, left, in, a, battered, and, weakened, state, and, far, from, the, english, channel, william, assembled, a, large, invasion, fleet, and, an, army, gathered, from, normandy, and, all, over, france, including, large, contingents, from, brittany, and, flanders, he, mustered, his, forces, at, saint, valery, sur, somme, and, was, ready, to, cross, the, channel, by, about, 12, august, the, exact, numbers, and, composition, of, william, s, force, are, unknown, a, contemporary, document, claims, that, william, had, 726, ships, but, this, may, be, an, inflated, figure, figures, given, by, contemporary, writers, are, highly, exaggerated, varying, from, 14, 000, to, 150, 000, men, modern, historians, have, offered, a, range, of, estimates, for, the, size, of, william, s, forces, 7000, 8000, men, 1000, 2000, of, them, cavalry, 10, 000, 12, 000, men, 10, 000, men, 3000, of, them, cavalry, or, 7500, men, the, army, would, have, consisted, of, a, mix, of, cavalry, infantry, and, archers, or, crossbowmen, with, about, equal, numbers, of, cavalry, and, archers, and, the, foot, soldiers, equal, in, number, to, the, other, two, types, combined, although, later, lists, of, companions, of, william, the, conqueror, are, extant, most, are, padded, with, extra, names, only, about, 35, individuals, can, be, reliably, claimed, to, have, been, with, william, at, hastings, william, of, poitiers, states, that, william, obtained, pope, alexander, ii, s, consent, for, the, invasion, signified, by, a, papal, banner, along, with, diplomatic, support, from, other, european, rulers, although, alexander, did, give, papal, approval, to, the, conquest, after, it, succeeded, no, other, source, claims, papal, support, before, the, invasion, william, s, army, assembled, during, the, summer, while, an, invasion, fleet, in, normandy, was, constructed, although, the, army, and, fleet, were, ready, by, early, august, adverse, winds, kept, the, ships, in, normandy, until, late, september, there, were, probably, other, reasons, for, william, s, delay, including, intelligence, reports, from, england, revealing, that, harold, s, forces, were, deployed, along, the, coast, william, would, have, preferred, to, delay, the, invasion, until, he, could, make, an, unopposed, landing, the, normans, crossed, to, england, a, few, days, after, harold, s, victory, over, the, norwegians, at, stamford, bridge, on, 25, september, following, the, dispersal, of, harold, s, naval, force, they, landed, at, pevensey, in, sussex, on, 28, september, and, erected, a, wooden, castle, at, hastings, from, which, they, raided, the, surrounding, area, this, ensured, supplies, for, the, army, and, as, harold, and, his, family, held, many, of, the, lands, in, the, area, it, weakened, william, s, opponent, and, made, him, more, likely, to, attack, to, put, an, end, to, the, raiding, harold, after, defeating, his, brother, tostig, and, harald, hardrada, in, the, north, left, much, of, his, force, there, including, morcar, and, edwin, and, marched, the, rest, of, his, army, south, to, deal, with, the, threatened, norman, invasion, it, is, unclear, when, harold, learned, of, william, s, landing, but, it, was, probably, while, he, was, travelling, south, harold, stopped, in, london, for, about, a, week, before, reaching, hastings, so, it, is, likely, that, he, took, a, second, week, to, march, south, averaging, about, 27, miles, 43, kilometres, per, day, for, the, nearly, 200, miles, 320, kilometres, to, london, although, harold, attempted, to, surprise, the, normans, william, s, scouts, reported, the, english, arrival, to, the, duke, the, exact, events, preceding, the, battle, remain, obscure, with, contradictory, accounts, in, the, sources, but, all, agree, that, william, led, his, army, from, his, castle, and, advanced, towards, the, enemy, harold, had, taken, up, a, defensive, position, at, the, top, of, senlac, hill, present, day, battle, east, sussex, about, 6, miles, 10, kilometres, from, william, s, castle, at, hastings, contemporary, sources, do, not, give, reliable, data, on, the, size, and, composition, of, harold, s, army, although, two, norman, sources, give, figures, of, 1, 2, million, or, 400, 000, men, recent, historians, have, suggested, figures, of, between, 5000, and, 13, 000, for, harold, s, army, at, hastings, but, most, agree, on, a, range, of, between, 7000, and, 8000, english, troops, these, men, would, have, comprised, a, mix, of, the, fyrd, militia, mainly, composed, of, foot, soldiers, and, the, housecarls, or, nobleman, s, personal, troops, who, usually, also, fought, on, foot, the, main, difference, between, the, two, types, was, in, their, armour, the, housecarls, used, better, protecting, armour, than, that, of, the, fyrd, the, english, army, does, not, appear, to, have, had, many, archers, although, some, were, present, the, identities, of, few, of, the, englishmen, at, hastings, are, known, the, most, important, were, harold, s, brothers, gyrth, and, leofwine, about, 18, other, named, individuals, can, reasonably, be, assumed, to, have, fought, with, harold, at, hastings, including, two, other, relatives, the, battle, began, at, about, 9, am, on, 14, october, 1066, and, lasted, all, day, but, while, a, broad, outline, is, known, the, exact, events, are, obscured, by, contradictory, accounts, in, the, sources, although, the, numbers, on, each, side, were, probably, about, equal, william, had, both, cavalry, and, infantry, including, many, archers, while, harold, had, only, foot, soldiers, and, few, archers, the, english, soldiers, formed, up, as, a, shield, wall, along, the, ridge, and, were, at, first, so, effective, that, william, s, army, was, thrown, back, with, heavy, casualties, some, of, william, s, breton, troops, panicked, and, fled, and, some, of, the, english, troops, appear, to, have, pursued, the, fleeing, bretons, norman, cavalry, then, attacked, and, killed, the, pursuing, troops, while, the, bretons, were, fleeing, rumours, swept, the, norman, forces, that, the, duke, had, been, killed, but, william, rallied, his, troops, twice, more, the, normans, made, feigned, withdrawals, tempting, the, english, into, pursuit, and, allowing, the, norman, cavalry, to, attack, them, repeatedly, the, available, sources, are, more, confused, about, events, in, the, afternoon, but, it, appears, that, the, decisive, event, was, the, death, of, harold, about, which, different, stories, are, told, william, of, jumieges, claimed, that, harold, was, killed, by, the, duke, the, bayeux, tapestry, has, been, claimed, to, show, harold, s, death, by, an, arrow, to, the, eye, but, this, may, be, a, later, reworking, of, the, tapestry, to, conform, to, 12th, century, stories, that, harold, had, died, from, an, arrow, wound, to, the, head, other, sources, stated, that, no, one, knew, how, harold, died, because, the, press, of, battle, was, so, tight, around, the, king, that, the, soldiers, could, not, see, who, struck, the, fatal, blow, william, of, poitiers, gives, no, details, about, harold, s, death, the, day, after, the, battle, harold, s, body, was, identified, either, by, his, armour, or, marks, on, his, body, the, bodies, of, the, english, dead, who, included, some, of, harold, s, brothers, and, his, housecarls, were, left, on, the, battlefield, although, some, were, removed, by, relatives, later, gytha, harold, s, mother, offered, the, victorious, duke, the, weight, of, her, son, s, body, in, gold, for, its, custody, but, her, offer, was, refused, william, ordered, that, harold, s, body, be, thrown, into, the, sea, but, whether, that, took, place, is, unclear, another, story, relates, that, harold, was, buried, at, the, top, of, a, cliff, waltham, abbey, which, had, been, founded, by, harold, later, claimed, that, his, body, had, been, buried, there, secretly, later, legends, claimed, that, harold, did, not, die, at, hastings, but, escaped, and, became, a, hermit, at, chester, after, his, victory, at, hastings, william, expected, to, receive, the, submission, of, the, surviving, english, leaders, but, instead, edgar, the, theling, was, proclaimed, king, by, the, witenagemot, with, the, support, of, earls, edwin, and, morcar, stigand, the, archbishop, of, canterbury, and, ealdred, the, archbishop, of, york, william, therefore, advanced, marching, around, the, coast, of, kent, to, london, he, defeated, an, english, force, that, attacked, him, at, southwark, but, being, unable, to, storm, london, bridge, he, sought, to, reach, the, capital, by, a, more, circuitous, route, william, moved, up, the, thames, valley, to, cross, the, river, at, wallingford, berkshire, while, there, he, received, the, submission, of, stigand, he, then, travelled, north, east, along, the, chilterns, before, advancing, towards, london, from, the, north, west, fighting, further, engagements, against, forces, from, the, city, having, failed, to, muster, an, effective, military, response, edgar, s, leading, supporters, lost, their, nerve, and, the, english, leaders, surrendered, to, william, at, berkhamsted, hertfordshire, william, was, acclaimed, king, of, england, and, crowned, by, ealdred, on, 25, december, 1066, in, westminster, abbey, the, new, king, attempted, to, conciliate, the, remaining, english, nobility, by, confirming, morcar, edwin, and, waltheof, the, earl, of, northumbria, in, their, lands, as, well, as, giving, some, land, to, edgar, the, theling, william, remained, in, england, until, march, 1067, when, he, returned, to, normandy, with, english, prisoners, including, stigand, morcar, edwin, edgar, the, theling, and, waltheof, despite, the, submission, of, the, english, nobles, resistance, continued, for, several, years, william, left, control, of, england, in, the, hands, of, his, half, brother, odo, and, one, of, his, closest, supporters, william, fitzosbern, in, 1067, rebels, in, kent, launched, an, unsuccessful, attack, on, dover, castle, in, combination, with, eustace, ii, of, boulogne, the, shropshire, landowner, eadric, the, wild, in, alliance, with, the, welsh, rulers, of, gwynedd, and, powys, raised, a, revolt, in, western, mercia, fighting, norman, forces, based, in, hereford, these, events, forced, william, to, return, to, england, at, the, end, of, 1067, in, 1068, william, besieged, rebels, in, exeter, including, harold, s, mother, gytha, and, after, suffering, heavy, losses, managed, to, negotiate, the, town, s, surrender, in, may, william, s, wife, matilda, was, crowned, queen, at, westminster, an, important, symbol, of, william, s, growing, international, stature, later, in, the, year, edwin, and, morcar, raised, a, revolt, in, mercia, with, welsh, assistance, while, gospatric, the, newly, appointed, earl, of, northumbria, led, a, rising, in, northumbria, which, had, not, yet, been, occupied, by, the, normans, these, rebellions, rapidly, collapsed, as, william, moved, against, them, building, castles, and, installing, garrisons, as, he, had, already, done, in, the, south, edwin, and, morcar, again, submitted, while, gospatric, fled, to, scotland, as, did, edgar, the, theling, and, his, family, who, may, have, been, involved, in, these, revolts, meanwhile, harold, s, sons, who, had, taken, refuge, in, ireland, raided, somerset, devon, and, cornwall, from, the, sea, early, in, 1069, the, newly, installed, norman, earl, of, northumbria, robert, de, comines, and, several, hundred, soldiers, accompanying, him, were, massacred, at, durham, the, northumbrian, rebellion, was, joined, by, edgar, gospatric, siward, barn, and, other, rebels, who, had, taken, refuge, in, scotland, the, castellan, of, york, robert, fitzrichard, was, defeated, and, killed, and, the, rebels, besieged, the, norman, castle, at, york, william, hurried, north, with, an, army, defeated, the, rebels, outside, york, and, pursued, them, into, the, city, massacring, the, inhabitants, and, bringing, the, revolt, to, an, end, he, built, a, second, castle, at, york, strengthened, norman, forces, in, northumbria, and, then, returned, south, a, subsequent, local, uprising, was, crushed, by, the, garrison, of, york, harold, s, sons, launched, a, second, raid, from, ireland, and, were, defeated, at, the, battle, of, northam, in, devon, by, norman, forces, under, count, brian, a, son, of, eudes, count, of, penthi, vre, in, august, or, september, 1069, a, large, fleet, sent, by, sweyn, ii, of, denmark, arrived, off, the, coast, of, england, sparking, a, new, wave, of, rebellions, across, the, country, after, abortive, raids, in, the, south, the, danes, joined, forces, with, a, new, northumbrian, uprising, which, was, also, joined, by, edgar, gospatric, and, the, other, exiles, from, scotland, as, well, as, waltheof, the, combined, danish, and, english, forces, defeated, the, norman, garrison, at, york, seized, the, castles, and, took, control, of, northumbria, although, a, raid, into, lincolnshire, led, by, edgar, was, defeated, by, the, norman, garrison, of, lincoln, at, the, same, time, resistance, flared, up, again, in, western, mercia, where, the, forces, of, eadric, the, wild, together, with, his, welsh, allies, and, further, rebel, forces, from, cheshire, and, shropshire, attacked, the, castle, at, shrewsbury, in, the, southwest, rebels, from, devon, and, cornwall, attacked, the, norman, garrison, at, exeter, but, were, repulsed, by, the, defenders, and, scattered, by, a, norman, relief, force, under, count, brian, other, rebels, from, dorset, somerset, and, neighbouring, areas, besieged, montacute, castle, but, were, defeated, by, a, norman, army, gathered, from, london, winchester, and, salisbury, under, geoffrey, of, coutances, meanwhile, william, attacked, the, danes, who, had, moored, for, the, winter, south, of, the, humber, in, lincolnshire, and, drove, them, back, to, the, north, bank, leaving, robert, of, mortain, in, charge, of, lincolnshire, he, turned, west, and, defeated, the, mercian, rebels, in, battle, at, stafford, when, the, danes, attempted, to, return, to, lincolnshire, the, norman, forces, there, again, drove, them, back, across, the, humber, william, advanced, into, northumbria, defeating, an, attempt, to, block, his, crossing, of, the, swollen, river, aire, at, pontefract, the, danes, fled, at, his, approach, and, he, occupied, york, he, bought, off, the, danes, who, agreed, to, leave, england, in, the, spring, and, during, the, winter, of, 1069, 70, his, forces, systematically, devastated, northumbria, in, the, harrying, of, the, north, subduing, all, resistance, as, a, symbol, of, his, renewed, authority, over, the, north, william, ceremonially, wore, his, crown, at, york, on, christmas, day, 1069, in, early, 1070, having, secured, the, submission, of, waltheof, and, gospatric, and, driven, edgar, and, his, remaining, supporters, back, to, scotland, william, returned, to, mercia, where, he, based, himself, at, chester, and, crushed, all, remaining, resistance, in, the, area, before, returning, to, the, south, papal, legates, arrived, and, at, easter, re, crowned, william, which, would, have, symbolically, reasserted, his, right, to, the, kingdom, william, also, oversaw, a, purge, of, prelates, from, the, church, most, notably, stigand, who, was, deposed, from, canterbury, the, papal, legates, also, imposed, penances, on, william, and, those, of, his, supporters, who, had, taken, part, in, hastings, and, the, subsequent, campaigns, as, well, as, canterbury, the, see, of, york, had, become, vacant, following, the, death, of, ealdred, in, september, 1069, both, sees, were, filled, by, men, loyal, to, william, lanfranc, abbot, of, william, s, foundation, at, caen, received, canterbury, while, thomas, of, bayeux, one, of, william, s, chaplains, was, installed, at, york, some, other, bishoprics, and, abbeys, also, received, new, bishops, and, abbots, and, william, confiscated, some, of, the, wealth, of, the, english, monasteries, which, had, served, as, repositories, for, the, assets, of, the, native, nobles, in, 1070, sweyn, ii, of, denmark, arrived, to, take, personal, command, of, his, fleet, and, renounced, the, earlier, agreement, to, withdraw, sending, troops, into, the, fens, to, join, forces, with, english, rebels, led, by, hereward, the, wake, at, that, time, based, on, the, isle, of, ely, sweyn, soon, accepted, a, further, payment, of, danegeld, from, william, and, returned, home, after, the, departure, of, the, danes, the, fenland, rebels, remained, at, large, protected, by, the, marshes, and, early, in, 1071, there, was, a, final, outbreak, of, rebel, activity, in, the, area, edwin, and, morcar, again, turned, against, william, and, although, edwin, was, quickly, betrayed, and, killed, morcar, reached, ely, where, he, and, hereward, were, joined, by, exiled, rebels, who, had, sailed, from, scotland, william, arrived, with, an, army, and, a, fleet, to, finish, off, this, last, pocket, of, resistance, after, some, costly, failures, the, normans, managed, to, construct, a, pontoon, to, reach, the, isle, of, ely, defeated, the, rebels, at, the, bridgehead, and, stormed, the, island, marking, the, effective, end, of, english, resistance, morcar, was, imprisoned, for, the, rest, of, his, life, hereward, was, pardoned, and, had, his, lands, returned, to, him, william, faced, difficulties, in, his, continental, possessions, in, 1071, but, in, 1072, he, returned, to, england, and, marched, north, to, confront, king, malcolm, iii, of, scotland, this, campaign, which, included, a, land, army, supported, by, a, fleet, resulted, in, the, treaty, of, abernethy, in, which, malcolm, expelled, edgar, the, theling, from, scotland, and, agreed, to, some, degree, of, subordination, to, william, the, exact, status, of, this, subordination, was, unclear, the, treaty, merely, stated, that, malcolm, became, william, s, man, whether, this, meant, only, for, cumbria, and, lothian, or, for, the, whole, scottish, kingdom, was, left, ambiguous, in, 1075, during, william, s, absence, ralph, de, gael, the, earl, of, norfolk, and, roger, de, breteuil, the, earl, of, hereford, conspired, to, overthrow, him, in, the, revolt, of, the, earls, the, exact, reason, for, the, rebellion, is, unclear, but, it, was, launched, at, the, wedding, of, ralph, to, a, relative, of, roger, s, held, at, exning, another, earl, waltheof, despite, being, one, of, william, s, favourites, was, also, involved, and, some, breton, lords, were, ready, to, offer, support, ralph, also, requested, danish, aid, william, remained, in, normandy, while, his, men, in, england, subdued, the, revolt, roger, was, unable, to, leave, his, stronghold, in, herefordshire, because, of, efforts, by, wulfstan, the, bishop, of, worcester, and, thelwig, the, abbot, of, evesham, ralph, was, bottled, up, in, norwich, castle, by, the, combined, efforts, of, odo, of, bayeux, geoffrey, of, coutances, richard, fitzgilbert, and, william, de, warenne, norwich, was, besieged, and, surrendered, and, ralph, went, into, exile, meanwhile, the, danish, king, s, brother, cnut, had, finally, arrived, in, england, with, a, fleet, of, 200, ships, but, he, was, too, late, as, norwich, had, already, surrendered, the, danes, then, raided, along, the, coast, before, returning, home, william, did, not, return, to, england, until, later, in, 1075, to, deal, with, the, danish, threat, and, the, aftermath, of, the, rebellion, celebrating, christmas, at, winchester, roger, and, waltheof, were, kept, in, prison, where, waltheof, was, executed, in, may, 1076, by, that, time, william, had, returned, to, the, continent, where, ralph, was, continuing, the, rebellion, from, brittany, once, england, had, been, conquered, the, normans, faced, many, challenges, in, maintaining, control, they, were, few, in, number, compared, to, the, native, english, population, including, those, from, other, parts, of, france, historians, estimate, the, number, of, norman, landholders, at, around, 8000, william, s, followers, expected, and, received, lands, and, titles, in, return, for, their, service, in, the, invasion, but, william, claimed, ultimate, possession, of, the, land, in, england, over, which, his, armies, had, given, him, de, facto, control, and, asserted, the, right, to, dispose, of, it, as, he, saw, fit, henceforth, all, land, was, held, directly, from, the, king, in, feudal, tenure, in, return, for, military, service, a, norman, lord, typically, had, properties, scattered, piecemeal, throughout, england, and, normandy, and, not, in, a, single, geographic, block, to, find, the, lands, to, compensate, his, norman, followers, william, initially, confiscated, the, estates, of, all, the, english, lords, who, had, fought, and, died, with, harold, and, redistributed, part, of, their, lands, these, confiscations, led, to, revolts, which, resulted, in, more, confiscations, a, cycle, that, continued, for, five, years, after, the, battle, of, hastings, to, put, down, and, prevent, further, rebellions, the, normans, constructed, castles, and, fortifications, in, unprecedented, numbers, initially, mostly, on, the, motte, and, bailey, pattern, historian, robert, liddiard, remarks, that, to, glance, at, the, urban, landscape, of, norwich, durham, or, lincoln, is, to, be, forcibly, reminded, of, the, impact, of, the, norman, invasion, william, and, his, barons, also, exercised, tighter, control, over, inheritance, of, property, by, widows, and, daughters, often, forcing, marriages, to, normans, a, measure, of, william, s, success, in, taking, control, is, that, from, 1072, until, the, capetian, conquest, of, normandy, in, 1204, william, and, his, successors, were, largely, absentee, rulers, for, example, after, 1072, william, spent, more, than, 75, per, cent, of, his, time, in, france, rather, than, england, while, he, needed, to, be, personally, present, in, normandy, to, defend, the, realm, from, foreign, invasion, and, put, down, internal, revolts, he, set, up, royal, administrative, structures, that, enabled, him, to, rule, england, from, a, distance, a, direct, consequence, of, the, invasion, was, the, almost, total, elimination, of, the, old, english, aristocracy, and, the, loss, of, english, control, over, the, catholic, church, in, england, william, systematically, dispossessed, english, landowners, and, conferred, their, property, on, his, continental, followers, the, domesday, book, of, 1086, meticulously, documents, the, impact, of, this, colossal, programme, of, expropriation, revealing, that, by, that, time, only, about, 5, per, cent, of, land, in, england, south, of, the, tees, was, left, in, english, hands, even, this, tiny, residue, was, further, diminished, in, the, decades, that, followed, the, elimination, of, native, landholding, being, most, complete, in, southern, parts, of, the, country, natives, were, also, removed, from, high, governmental, and, ecclesiastical, offices, after, 1075, all, earldoms, were, held, by, normans, and, englishmen, were, only, occasionally, appointed, as, sheriffs, likewise, in, the, church, senior, english, office, holders, were, either, expelled, from, their, positions, or, kept, in, place, for, their, lifetimes, and, replaced, by, foreigners, when, they, died, after, the, death, of, wulfstan, in, 1095, no, bishopric, was, held, by, any, englishman, and, english, abbots, became, uncommon, especially, in, the, larger, monasteries, following, the, conquest, many, anglo, saxons, including, groups, of, nobles, fled, the, country, for, scotland, ireland, or, scandinavia, members, of, king, harold, godwinson, s, family, sought, refuge, in, ireland, and, used, their, bases, in, that, country, for, unsuccessful, invasions, of, england, the, largest, single, exodus, occurred, in, the, 1070s, when, a, group, of, anglo, saxons, in, a, fleet, of, 235, ships, sailed, for, the, byzantine, empire, the, empire, became, a, popular, destination, for, many, english, nobles, and, soldiers, as, the, byzantines, were, in, need, of, mercenaries, the, english, became, the, predominant, element, in, the, elite, varangian, guard, until, then, a, largely, scandinavian, unit, from, which, the, emperor, s, bodyguard, was, drawn, some, of, the, english, migrants, were, settled, in, byzantine, frontier, regions, on, the, black, sea, coast, and, established, towns, with, names, such, as, new, london, and, new, york, before, the, normans, arrived, anglo, saxon, governmental, systems, were, more, sophisticated, than, their, counterparts, in, normandy, all, of, england, was, divided, into, administrative, units, called, shires, with, subdivisions, the, royal, court, was, the, centre, of, government, and, a, justice, system, based, on, local, and, regional, tribunals, existed, to, secure, the, rights, of, free, men, shires, were, run, by, officials, known, as, shire, reeves, or, sheriffs, most, medieval, governments, were, always, on, the, move, holding, court, wherever, the, weather, and, food, or, other, matters, were, best, at, the, moment, england, had, a, permanent, treasury, at, winchester, before, william, s, conquest, one, major, reason, for, the, strength, of, the, english, monarchy, was, the, wealth, of, the, kingdom, built, on, the, english, system, of, taxation, that, included, a, land, tax, or, the, geld, english, coinage, was, also, superior, to, most, of, the, other, currencies, in, use, in, northwestern, europe, and, the, ability, to, mint, coins, was, a, royal, monopoly, the, english, kings, had, also, developed, the, system, of, issuing, writs, to, their, officials, in, addition, to, the, normal, medieval, practice, of, issuing, charters, writs, were, either, instructions, to, an, official, or, group, of, officials, or, notifications, of, royal, actions, such, as, appointments, to, office, or, a, grant, of, some, sort, this, sophisticated, medieval, form, of, government, was, handed, over, to, the, normans, and, was, the, foundation, of, further, developments, they, kept, the, framework, of, government, but, made, changes, in, the, personnel, although, at, first, the, new, king, attempted, to, keep, some, natives, in, office, by, the, end, of, william, s, reign, most, of, the, officials, of, government, and, the, royal, household, were, normans, the, language, of, official, documents, also, changed, from, old, english, to, latin, the, forest, laws, were, introduced, leading, to, the, setting, aside, of, large, sections, of, england, as, royal, forest, the, domesday, survey, was, an, administrative, catalogue, of, the, landholdings, of, the, kingdom, and, was, unique, to, medieval, europe, it, was, divided, into, sections, based, on, the, shires, and, listed, all, the, landholdings, of, each, tenant, in, chief, of, the, king, as, well, as, who, had, held, the, land, before, the, conquest, one, of, the, most, obvious, effects, of, the, conquest, was, the, introduction, of, anglo, norman, a, northern, dialect, of, old, french, with, limited, nordic, influences, as, the, language, of, the, ruling, classes, in, england, displacing, old, english, norman, french, words, entered, the, english, language, and, a, further, sign, of, the, shift, was, the, usage, of, names, common, in, france, instead, of, anglo, saxon, names, male, names, such, as, william, robert, and, richard, soon, became, common, female, names, changed, more, slowly, the, norman, invasion, had, little, impact, on, placenames, which, had, changed, significantly, after, earlier, scandinavian, invasions, it, is, not, known, precisely, how, much, english, the, norman, invaders, learned, nor, how, much, the, knowledge, of, norman, french, spread, among, the, lower, classes, but, the, demands, of, trade, and, basic, communication, probably, meant, that, at, least, some, of, the, normans, and, native, english, were, bilingual, nevertheless, william, the, conqueror, never, developed, a, working, knowledge, of, english, and, for, centuries, afterwards, english, was, not, well, understood, by, the, nobility, an, estimated, 8000, normans, and, other, continentals, settled, in, england, as, a, result, of, the, conquest, although, exact, figures, cannot, be, established, some, of, these, new, residents, intermarried, with, the, native, english, but, the, extent, of, this, practice, in, the, years, immediately, after, hastings, is, unclear, several, marriages, are, attested, between, norman, men, and, english, women, during, the, years, before, 1100, but, such, marriages, were, uncommon, most, normans, continued, to, contract, marriages, with, other, normans, or, other, continental, families, rather, than, with, the, english, within, a, century, of, the, invasion, intermarriage, between, the, native, english, and, the, norman, immigrants, had, become, common, by, the, early, 1160s, ailred, of, rievaulx, was, writing, that, intermarriage, was, common, in, all, levels, of, society, the, impact, of, the, conquest, on, the, lower, levels, of, english, society, is, difficult, to, assess, the, major, change, was, the, elimination, of, slavery, in, england, which, had, disappeared, by, the, middle, of, the, 12th, century, there, were, about, 28, 000, slaves, listed, in, the, domesday, book, in, 1086, fewer, than, had, been, enumerated, for, 1066, in, some, places, such, as, essex, the, decline, in, slaves, was, 20, per, cent, for, the, 20, years, the, main, reasons, for, the, decline, in, slaveholding, appear, to, have, been, the, disapproval, of, the, church, and, the, cost, of, supporting, slaves, who, unlike, serfs, had, to, be, maintained, entirely, by, their, owners, the, practice, of, slavery, was, not, outlawed, and, the, leges, henrici, primi, from, the, reign, of, king, henry, i, continue, to, mention, slaveholding, as, legal, many, of, the, free, peasants, of, anglo, saxon, society, appear, to, have, lost, status, and, become, indistinguishable, from, the, non, free, serfs, whether, this, change, was, due, entirely, to, the, conquest, is, unclear, but, the, invasion, and, its, after, effects, probably, accelerated, a, process, already, underway, the, spread, of, towns, and, increase, in, nucleated, settlements, in, the, countryside, rather, than, scattered, farms, was, probably, accelerated, by, the, coming, of, the, normans, to, england, the, lifestyle, of, the, peasantry, probably, did, not, greatly, change, in, the, decades, after, 1066, although, earlier, historians, argued, that, women, became, less, free, and, lost, rights, with, the, conquest, current, scholarship, has, mostly, rejected, this, view, little, is, known, about, women, other, than, those, in, the, landholding, class, so, no, conclusions, can, be, drawn, about, peasant, women, s, status, after, 1066, noblewomen, appear, to, have, continued, to, influence, political, life, mainly, through, their, kinship, relationships, both, before, and, after, 1066, aristocratic, women, could, own, land, and, some, women, continued, to, have, the, ability, to, dispose, of, their, property, as, they, wished, debate, over, the, conquest, started, almost, immediately, the, anglo, saxon, chronicle, when, discussing, the, death, of, william, the, conqueror, denounced, him, and, the, conquest, in, verse, but, the, king, s, obituary, notice, from, william, of, poitiers, a, frenchman, was, full, of, praise, historians, since, then, have, argued, over, the, facts, of, the, matter, and, how, to, interpret, them, with, little, agreement, the, theory, or, myth, of, the, norman, yoke, arose, in, the, 17th, century, the, idea, that, anglo, saxon, society, had, been, freer, and, more, equal, than, the, society, that, emerged, after, the, conquest, this, theory, owes, more, to, the, period, in, which, it, was, developed, than, to, historical, facts, but, it, continues, to, be, used, to, the, present, day, in, both, political, and, popular, thought, in, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, historians, have, focused, less, on, the, rightness, or, wrongness, of, the, conquest, itself, instead, concentrating, on, the, effects, of, the, invasion, some, such, as, richard, southern, have, seen, the, conquest, as, a, critical, turning, point, in, history, southern, stated, that, no, country, in, europe, between, the, rise, of, the, barbarian, kingdoms, and, the, 20th, century, has, undergone, so, radical, a, change, in, so, short, a, time, as, england, experienced, after, 1066, other, historians, such, as, h, g, richardson, and, g, o, sayles, believe, that, the, transformation, was, less, radical, in, more, general, terms, singman, has, called, the, conquest, the, last, echo, of, the, national, migrations, that, characterized, the, early, middle, ages, the, debate, over, the, impact, of, the, conquest, depends, on, how, change, after, 1066, is, measured, if, anglo, saxon, england, was, already, evolving, before, the, invasion, with, the, introduction, of, feudalism, castles, or, other, changes, in, society, then, the, conquest, while, important, did, not, represent, radical, reform, but, the, change, was, dramatic, if, measured, by, the, elimination, of, the, english, nobility, or, the, loss, of, old, english, as, a, literary, language, nationalistic, arguments, have, been, made, on, both, sides, of, the, debate, with, the, normans, cast, as, either, the, persecutors, of, the, english, or, the, rescuers, of, the, country, from, a, decadent, anglo, saxon, nobility
