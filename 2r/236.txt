early, umayyad, caliphs, prominent, positions, were, held, by, christians, some, of, whom, belonged, to, families, that, had, served, the, byzantines, the, employment, of, christians, was, part, of, a, broader, policy, of, religious, accommodation, that, was, necessitated, by, the, presence, of, large, christian, populations, in, the, conquered, provinces, as, in, syria, this, policy, also, boosted, mu, awiya, s, popularity, and, solidified, syria, as, his, power, base, the, umayyad, era, is, often, considered, the, formative, period, in, islamic, art, during, the, pre, islamic, period, the, umayyads, or, banu, umayya, were, a, leading, clan, of, the, quraysh, tribe, of, mecca, by, the, end, of, the, 6th, century, the, umayyads, dominated, the, quraysh, s, increasingly, prosperous, trade, networks, with, syria, and, developed, economic, and, military, alliances, with, the, nomadic, arab, tribes, that, controlled, the, northern, and, central, arabian, desert, expanses, affording, the, clan, a, degree, of, political, power, in, the, region, the, umayyads, under, the, leadership, of, abu, sufyan, ibn, harb, were, the, principal, leaders, of, meccan, opposition, to, the, islamic, prophet, muhammad, but, after, the, latter, captured, mecca, in, 630, abu, sufyan, and, the, quraysh, embraced, islam, to, reconcile, his, influential, qurayshite, tribesmen, muhammad, gave, his, former, opponents, including, abu, sufyan, a, stake, in, the, new, order, abu, sufyan, and, the, umayyads, relocated, to, medina, islam, s, political, centre, to, maintain, their, new, found, political, influence, in, the, nascent, muslim, community, muhammad, s, death, in, 632, left, open, the, succession, of, leadership, of, the, muslim, community, leaders, of, the, ansar, the, natives, of, medina, who, had, provided, muhammad, safe, haven, after, his, emigration, from, mecca, in, 622, discussed, forwarding, their, own, candidate, out, of, concern, that, the, muhajirun, muhammad, s, early, followers, and, fellow, emigrants, from, mecca, would, ally, with, their, fellow, tribesmen, from, the, former, qurayshite, elite, and, take, control, of, the, muslim, state, the, muhajirun, gave, allegiance, to, one, of, their, own, the, early, elderly, companion, of, muhammad, abu, bakr, r, 632, 634, and, put, an, end, to, ansarite, deliberations, abu, bakr, was, viewed, as, acceptable, by, the, ansar, and, the, qurayshite, elite, and, was, acknowledged, as, caliph, leader, of, the, muslim, community, he, showed, favor, to, the, umayyads, by, awarding, them, command, roles, in, the, muslim, conquest, of, syria, one, of, the, appointees, was, yazid, the, son, of, abu, sufyan, who, owned, property, and, maintained, trade, networks, in, syria, abu, bakr, s, successor, umar, r, 634, 644, curtailed, the, influence, of, the, qurayshite, elite, in, favor, of, muhammad, s, earlier, supporters, in, the, administration, and, military, but, nonetheless, allowed, the, growing, foothold, of, abu, sufyan, s, sons, in, syria, which, was, all, but, conquered, by, 638, when, umar, s, overall, commander, of, the, province, abu, ubayda, ibn, al, jarrah, died, in, 639, he, appointed, yazid, governor, of, syria, s, damascus, palestine, and, jordan, districts, yazid, died, shortly, after, and, umar, appointed, his, brother, mu, awiya, in, his, place, umar, s, exceptional, treatment, of, abu, sufyan, s, sons, may, have, stemmed, from, his, respect, for, the, family, their, burgeoning, alliance, with, the, powerful, banu, kalb, tribe, as, a, counterbalance, to, the, influential, himyarite, settlers, in, homs, who, viewed, themselves, as, equals, to, the, quraysh, in, nobility, or, the, lack, of, a, suitable, candidate, at, the, time, particularly, amid, the, plague, of, amwas, which, had, already, killed, abu, ubayda, and, yazid, under, mu, awiya, s, stewardship, syria, remained, domestically, peaceful, organized, and, well, defended, from, its, former, byzantine, rulers, umar, s, successor, uthman, ibn, affan, was, a, wealthy, umayyad, and, early, muslim, convert, with, marital, ties, to, muhammad, he, was, elected, by, the, shura, council, composed, of, muhammad, s, cousin, ali, al, zubayr, ibn, al, awwam, talha, ibn, ubayd, allah, sa, d, ibn, abi, waqqas, and, abd, al, rahman, ibn, awf, all, of, whom, were, close, early, companions, of, muhammad, and, belonged, to, the, quraysh, he, was, chosen, over, ali, because, he, would, ensure, the, concentration, of, state, power, into, the, hands, of, the, quraysh, as, opposed, to, ali, s, determination, to, diffuse, power, among, all, of, the, muslim, factions, from, early, in, his, reign, uthman, displayed, explicit, favouritism, to, his, kinsmen, in, stark, contrast, to, his, predecessors, he, appointed, his, family, members, as, governors, over, the, regions, successively, conquered, under, umar, and, himself, namely, much, of, the, sasanian, empire, i, e, iraq, and, iran, and, the, former, byzantine, territories, of, syria, and, egypt, in, medina, he, relied, extensively, on, the, counsel, of, his, umayyad, cousins, the, brothers, al, harith, and, marwan, ibn, al, hakam, according, to, the, historian, wilferd, madelung, this, policy, stemmed, from, uthman, s, conviction, that, the, house, of, umayya, as, the, core, clan, of, quraysh, was, uniquely, qualified, to, rule, in, the, name, of, islam, uthman, s, nepotism, provoked, the, ire, of, the, ansar, and, the, members, of, the, shura, in, 645, 46, he, added, the, jazira, upper, mesopotamia, to, mu, awiya, s, syrian, governorship, and, granted, the, latter, s, request, to, take, possession, of, all, byzantine, crown, lands, in, syria, to, help, pay, his, troops, he, had, the, surplus, taxes, from, the, wealthy, provinces, of, kufa, and, egypt, forwarded, to, the, treasury, in, medina, which, he, used, at, his, personal, disposal, frequently, disbursing, its, funds, and, war, booty, to, his, umayyad, relatives, moreover, the, lucrative, sasanian, crown, lands, of, iraq, which, umar, had, designated, as, communal, property, for, the, benefit, of, the, arab, garrison, towns, of, kufa, and, basra, were, turned, into, caliphal, crown, lands, to, be, used, at, uthman, s, discretion, mounting, resentment, against, uthman, s, rule, in, iraq, and, egypt, and, among, the, ansar, and, quraysh, of, medina, culminated, in, the, killing, of, the, caliph, in, 656, in, the, assessment, of, the, historian, hugh, n, kennedy, uthman, was, killed, because, of, his, determination, to, centralize, control, over, the, caliphate, s, government, by, the, traditional, elite, of, the, quraysh, particularly, his, umayyad, clan, which, he, believed, possessed, the, experience, and, ability, to, govern, at, the, expense, of, the, interests, rights, and, privileges, of, many, early, muslims, after, uthman, s, assassination, ali, was, recognized, as, caliph, in, medina, though, his, support, stemmed, from, the, ansar, and, the, iraqis, while, the, bulk, of, the, quraysh, was, wary, of, his, rule, the, first, challenge, to, his, authority, came, from, the, qurayshite, leaders, al, zubayr, and, talha, who, had, opposed, uthman, s, empowerment, of, the, umayyad, clan, but, feared, that, their, own, influence, and, the, power, of, the, quraysh, in, general, would, dissipate, under, ali, backed, by, one, of, muhammad, s, wives, a, isha, they, attempted, to, rally, support, against, ali, among, the, troops, of, basra, prompting, the, caliph, to, leave, for, iraq, s, other, garrison, town, kufa, where, he, could, better, confront, his, challengers, ali, defeated, them, at, the, battle, of, the, camel, in, which, al, zubayr, and, talha, were, slain, and, a, isha, consequently, entered, self, imposed, seclusion, ali, s, sovereignty, was, thereafter, recognized, in, basra, and, egypt, and, he, established, kufa, as, the, caliphate, s, new, capital, although, ali, was, able, to, replace, uthman, s, governors, in, egypt, and, iraq, with, relative, ease, mu, awiya, had, developed, a, solid, power, base, and, an, effective, military, against, the, byzantines, from, the, arab, tribes, of, syria, mu, awiya, did, not, claim, the, caliphate, but, was, determined, to, retain, control, of, syria, and, opposed, ali, in, the, name, of, avenging, his, kinsman, uthman, accusing, the, caliph, of, culpability, in, his, death, ali, and, mu, awiya, fought, to, a, stalemate, at, the, battle, of, siffin, in, early, 657, ali, agreed, to, settle, the, matter, with, mu, awiya, by, arbitration, though, the, talks, failed, to, achieve, a, resolution, the, decision, to, arbitrate, fundamentally, weakened, ali, s, political, position, as, he, was, forced, to, negotiate, with, mu, awiya, on, equal, terms, while, it, drove, a, significant, number, of, his, supporters, who, became, known, as, the, kharijites, to, revolt, ali, s, coalition, steadily, disintegrated, and, many, iraqi, tribal, nobles, secretly, defected, to, mu, awiya, while, the, latter, s, ally, amr, ibn, al, as, ousted, ali, s, governor, from, egypt, in, july, 658, in, july, 660, mu, awiya, was, formally, recognized, as, caliph, in, jerusalem, by, his, syrian, tribal, allies, ali, was, assassinated, by, a, kharijite, dissident, in, january, 661, his, son, hasan, succeeded, him, but, abdicated, in, return, for, compensation, upon, mu, awiya, s, arrival, to, iraq, with, his, syrian, army, in, the, summer, at, that, point, mu, awiya, entered, kufa, and, received, the, allegiance, of, the, iraqis, the, recognition, of, mu, awiya, in, kufa, referred, to, as, the, year, of, unification, of, the, community, in, the, muslim, traditional, sources, is, generally, considered, the, start, of, his, caliphate, with, his, accession, the, political, capital, and, the, caliphal, treasury, were, transferred, to, damascus, the, seat, of, mu, awiya, s, power, syria, s, emergence, as, the, metropolis, of, the, umayyad, caliphate, was, the, result, of, mu, awiya, s, twenty, year, entrenchment, in, the, province, the, geographic, distribution, of, its, relatively, large, arab, population, throughout, the, province, in, contrast, to, their, seclusion, in, garrison, cities, in, other, provinces, and, the, domination, of, a, single, tribal, confederation, the, kalb, led, quda, a, as, opposed, to, the, wide, array, of, competing, tribal, groups, in, iraq, the, long, established, formerly, christian, arab, tribes, in, syria, having, been, integrated, into, the, military, of, the, byzantine, empire, and, their, ghassanid, client, kings, were, more, accustomed, to, order, and, obedience, than, their, iraqi, counterparts, according, to, the, historian, julius, wellhausen, mu, awiya, relied, on, the, powerful, kalbite, chief, ibn, bahdal, and, the, kindite, nobleman, shurahbil, ibn, simt, alongside, the, qurayshite, commanders, al, dahhak, ibn, qays, al, fihri, and, abd, al, rahman, the, son, of, the, prominent, general, khalid, ibn, al, walid, to, guarantee, the, loyalty, of, the, key, military, components, of, syria, mu, awiya, preoccupied, his, core, syrian, troops, in, nearly, annual, or, bi, annual, land, and, sea, raids, against, byzantium, which, provided, them, with, battlefield, experience, and, war, spoils, but, secured, no, permanent, territorial, gains, toward, the, end, of, his, reign, the, caliph, entered, a, thirty, year, truce, with, byzantine, emperor, constantine, iv, r, 668, 685, obliging, the, umayyads, to, pay, the, empire, an, annual, tribute, of, gold, horses, and, slaves, mu, awiya, s, main, challenge, was, reestablishing, the, unity, of, the, muslim, community, and, asserting, his, authority, and, that, of, the, caliphate, in, the, provinces, amid, the, political, and, social, disintegration, of, the, first, fitna, there, remained, significant, opposition, to, his, assumption, of, the, caliphate, and, to, a, strong, central, government, the, garrison, towns, of, kufa, and, basra, populated, by, the, arab, immigrants, and, troops, who, arrived, during, the, conquest, of, iraq, in, the, 630s, 640s, resented, the, transition, of, power, to, syria, they, remained, divided, nonetheless, as, both, cities, competed, for, power, and, influence, in, iraq, and, its, eastern, dependencies, and, remained, divided, between, the, arab, tribal, nobility, and, the, early, muslim, converts, the, latter, of, whom, were, divided, between, the, pro, alids, loyalists, of, ali, and, the, kharijites, who, followed, their, own, strict, interpretation, of, islam, the, caliph, applied, a, decentralized, approach, to, governing, iraq, by, forging, alliances, with, its, tribal, nobility, such, as, the, kufan, leader, al, ash, ath, ibn, qays, and, entrusting, the, administration, of, kufa, and, basra, to, highly, experienced, members, of, the, thaqif, tribe, al, mughira, ibn, shu, ba, and, the, latter, s, protege, ziyad, ibn, abihi, whom, mu, awiya, adopted, as, his, half, brother, respectively, in, return, for, recognizing, his, suzerainty, maintaining, order, and, forwarding, a, token, portion, of, the, provincial, tax, revenues, to, damascus, the, caliph, let, his, governors, rule, with, practical, independence, after, al, mughira, s, death, in, 670, mu, awiya, attached, kufa, and, its, dependencies, to, the, governorship, of, basra, making, ziyad, the, practical, viceroy, over, the, eastern, half, of, the, caliphate, afterward, ziyad, launched, a, concerted, campaign, to, firmly, establish, arab, rule, in, the, vast, khurasan, region, east, of, iran, and, restart, the, muslim, conquests, in, the, surrounding, areas, not, long, after, ziyad, s, death, he, was, succeeded, by, his, son, ubayd, allah, ibn, ziyad, meanwhile, amr, ibn, al, as, ruled, egypt, from, the, provincial, capital, of, fustat, as, a, virtual, partner, of, mu, awiya, until, his, death, in, 663, after, which, loyalist, governors, were, appointed, and, the, province, became, a, practical, appendage, of, syria, under, mu, awiya, s, direction, the, muslim, conquest, of, ifriqiya, central, north, africa, was, launched, by, the, commander, uqba, ibn, nafi, in, 670, which, extended, umayyad, control, as, far, as, byzacena, modern, southern, tunisia, where, uqba, founded, the, permanent, arab, garrison, city, of, kairouan, in, contrast, to, uthman, mu, awiya, restricted, the, influence, of, his, umayyad, kinsmen, to, the, governorship, of, medina, where, the, dispossessed, islamic, elite, including, the, umayyads, was, suspicious, or, hostile, toward, his, rule, however, in, an, unprecedented, move, in, islamic, politics, mu, awiya, nominated, his, own, son, yazid, i, as, his, successor, in, 676, introducing, hereditary, rule, to, caliphal, succession, and, in, practice, turning, the, office, of, the, caliph, into, a, kingship, the, act, was, met, with, disapproval, or, opposition, by, the, iraqis, and, the, hejaz, based, quraysh, including, the, umayyads, but, most, were, bribed, or, coerced, into, acceptance, yazid, acceded, after, mu, awiya, s, death, in, 680, and, almost, immediately, faced, a, challenge, to, his, rule, by, the, kufan, partisans, of, ali, who, had, invited, ali, s, son, and, muhammad, s, grandson, husayn, to, stage, a, revolt, against, umayyad, rule, from, iraq, an, army, mobilized, by, iraq, s, governor, ibn, ziyad, intercepted, and, killed, husayn, outside, kufa, at, the, battle, of, karbala, although, it, stymied, active, opposition, to, yazid, in, iraq, the, killing, of, muhammad, s, grandson, left, many, muslims, outraged, and, significantly, increased, kufan, hostility, toward, the, umayyads, and, sympathy, for, the, family, of, ali, the, next, major, challenge, to, yazid, s, rule, emanated, from, the, hejaz, where, abd, allah, ibn, al, zubayr, the, son, of, al, zubayr, ibn, al, awwam, and, grandson, of, abu, bakr, advocated, for, a, shura, among, the, quraysh, to, elect, the, caliph, and, rallied, opposition, to, the, umayyads, from, his, headquarters, in, islam, s, holiest, sanctuary, the, ka, aba, in, mecca, the, ansar, and, quraysh, of, medina, also, took, up, the, anti, umayyad, cause, and, in, 683, expelled, the, umayyads, from, the, city, yazid, s, syrian, troops, routed, the, medinans, at, the, battle, of, al, harra, and, subsequently, plundered, medina, before, besieging, ibn, al, zubayr, in, mecca, the, syrians, withdrew, upon, news, of, yazid, s, death, in, 683, after, which, ibn, al, zubayr, declared, himself, caliph, and, soon, after, gained, recognition, in, most, provinces, of, the, caliphate, including, iraq, and, egypt, in, syria, ibn, bahdal, secured, the, succession, of, yazid, s, son, and, appointed, successor, mu, awiya, ii, whose, authority, was, likely, restricted, to, damascus, and, syria, s, southern, districts, mu, awiya, ii, had, been, ill, from, the, beginning, of, his, accession, with, al, dahhak, assuming, the, practical, duties, of, his, office, and, he, died, in, early, 684, without, naming, a, successor, his, death, marked, the, end, of, the, umayyads, sufyanid, ruling, house, called, after, mu, awiya, i, s, father, abu, sufyan, umayyad, authority, nearly, collapsed, in, their, syrian, stronghold, after, the, death, of, mu, awiya, ii, al, dahhak, in, damascus, the, qays, tribes, in, qinnasrin, northern, syria, and, the, jazira, the, judham, in, palestine, and, the, ansar, and, south, arabians, of, homs, all, opted, to, recognize, ibn, al, zubayr, marwan, ibn, al, hakam, the, leader, of, the, umayyads, expelled, to, syria, from, medina, was, prepared, to, submit, to, ibn, al, zubayr, as, well, but, was, persuaded, to, forward, his, candidacy, for, the, caliphate, by, ibn, ziyad, the, latter, had, been, driven, out, of, iraq, and, strove, to, uphold, umayyad, rule, during, a, summit, of, pro, umayyad, syrian, tribes, namely, the, quda, a, and, their, kindite, allies, organized, by, ibn, bahdal, in, the, old, ghassanid, capital, of, jabiya, marwan, was, elected, caliph, in, exchange, for, economic, privileges, to, the, loyalist, tribes, at, the, subsequent, battle, of, marj, rahit, in, august, 684, marwan, led, his, tribal, allies, to, a, decisive, victory, against, a, much, larger, qaysite, army, led, by, al, dahhak, who, was, slain, not, long, after, the, south, arabians, of, homs, and, the, judham, joined, the, quda, a, to, form, the, tribal, confederation, of, yaman, marj, rahit, led, to, the, long, running, conflict, between, the, qays, and, yaman, coalitions, the, qays, regrouped, in, the, euphrates, river, fortress, of, circesium, under, zufar, ibn, al, harith, al, kilabi, and, moved, to, avenge, their, losses, although, marwan, regained, full, control, of, syria, in, the, months, following, the, battle, the, inter, tribal, strife, undermined, the, foundation, of, umayyad, power, the, syrian, army, in, 685, marwan, and, ibn, bahdal, expelled, the, zubayrid, governor, of, egypt, and, replaced, him, with, marwan, s, son, abd, al, aziz, who, would, rule, the, province, until, his, death, in, 704, 05, another, son, muhammad, was, appointed, to, suppress, zufar, s, rebellion, in, the, jazira, marwan, died, in, april, 685, and, was, succeeded, by, his, eldest, son, abd, al, malik, although, ibn, ziyad, attempted, to, restore, the, syrian, army, of, the, sufyanid, caliphs, persistent, divisions, along, qays, yaman, lines, contributed, to, the, army, s, massive, rout, and, ibn, ziyad, s, death, at, the, hands, of, the, pro, alid, forces, of, mukhtar, al, thaqafi, of, kufa, at, the, battle, of, khazir, in, august, 686, the, setback, delayed, abd, al, malik, s, attempts, to, reestablish, umayyad, authority, in, iraq, while, pressures, from, the, byzantine, empire, and, raids, into, syria, by, the, byzantines, mardaite, allies, compelled, him, to, sign, a, peace, treaty, with, byzantium, in, 689, which, substantially, increased, the, umayyads, annual, tribute, to, the, empire, during, his, siege, of, circesium, in, 691, abd, al, malik, reconciled, with, zufar, and, the, qays, by, offering, them, privileged, positions, in, the, umayyad, court, and, army, signaling, a, new, policy, by, the, caliph, and, his, successors, to, balance, the, interests, of,

province, s, leading, tribal, chiefs, and, defeated, iraq, s, ruler, ibn, al, zubayr, s, brother, mus, ab, at, the, battle, of, maskin, in, 691, afterward, the, umayyad, commander, al, hajjaj, ibn, yusuf, besieged, mecca, and, killed, ibn, al, zubayr, in, 692, marking, the, end, of, the, second, fitna, and, the, reunification, of, the, caliphate, under, abd, al, malik, s, rule, iraq, remained,

province, under, the, governorship, of, al, hajjaj, who, oversaw, the, suppression, of, the, kharijite, revolts, in, iraq, and, iran, by, 698, and, was, subsequently, given, authority, over, the, rest, of, the, eastern, caliphate, resentment, among, the, iraqi, troops, towards, al, hajjaj, s, methods, of, governance, particularly, his, death, threats, to, force, participation, in, the, war,

ash, ath, grandson, of, al, ash, ath, ibn, qays, al, hajjaj, defeated, ibn, al, ash, ath, s, rebels, at, the, battle, of, dayr, al, jamajim, in, april, the, suppression, of, the, revolt, marked, the, end, of, the, iraqi, muq, tila, as, a, military, force, and, the, beginning, of, syrian, military, domination, of, iraq, iraqi, internal, divisions, and, the, utilization, of, more, disciplined, syrian, forces, by, abd, al, malik, and, al, hajjaj, voided, the, iraqis, attempt, to, reassert, power, in, the, province, to, consolidate, umayyad, rule, after, the, second, fitna, the, marwanids, launched, a, series, of, centralization, islamization, and, arabization, measures, to, prevent, further, rebellions, in, iraq, al, hajjaj, founded, a, permanent, syrian, garrison, in, wasit, situated, between, kufa, and, basra, and, instituted, a, more, rigorous, administration, in, the, province, power, thereafter, derived, from, the, syrian, troops, who, became, iraq, s, ruling, class, while, iraq, s, arab, nobility, religious, scholars, and, maw, l, became, their, virtual, subjects, the, surplus, from, the, agriculturally, rich, sawad, lands, was, redirected, from, the, muq, tila, to, the, caliphal, treasury, in, damascus, to, pay, the, syrian, troops, in, iraq, the, system, of, military, pay, established, by, umar, which, paid, stipends, to, veterans, of, the, earlier, muslim, conquests, and, their, descendants, was, ended, salaries, being, restricted, to, those, in, active, service, the, old, system, was, considered, a, handicap, on, abd, al, malik, s, executive, authority, and, financial, ability, to, reward, loyalists, in, the, army, thus, a, professional, army, was, established, during, abd, al, malik, s, reign, whose, salaries, derived, from, tax, proceeds, in, 693, the, byzantine, gold, solidus, was, replaced, in, syria, and, egypt, with, the, dinar, initially, the, new, coinage, contained, depictions, of, the, caliph, as, the, spiritual, leader, of, the, muslim, community, and, its, supreme, military, commander, this, image, proved, no, less, acceptable, to, muslim, officialdom, and, was, replaced, in, 696, or, 697, with, image, less, coinage, inscribed, with, qur, anic, quotes, and, other, muslim, religious, formulas, in, 698, 99, similar, changes, were, made, to, the, silver, dirhams, issued, by, the, muslims, in, the, former, sasanian, persian, lands, of, the, eastern, caliphate, arabic, replaced, persian, as, the, language, of, the, d, w, n, in, iraq, in, 697, greek, in, the, syrian, d, w, n, in, 700, and, greek, and, coptic, in, the, egyptian, d, w, n, in, 705, 06, arabic, ultimately, became, the, sole, official, language, of, the, umayyad, state, but, the, transition, in, faraway, provinces, such, as, khurasan, did, not, occur, until, the, 740s, although, the, official, language, was, changed, greek, and, persian, speaking, bureaucrats, who, were, versed, in, arabic, kept, their, posts, according, to, gibb, the, decrees, were, the, first, step, towards, the, reorganization, and, unification, of, the, diverse, tax, systems, in, the, provinces, and, also, a, step, towards, a, more, definitely, muslim, administration, indeed, it, formed, an, important, part, of, the, islamization, measures, that, lent, the, umayyad, caliphate, a, more, ideological, and, programmatic, coloring, it, had, previously, lacked, according, to, blankinship, in, 691, 92, abd, al, malik, completed, the, dome, of, the, rock, in, jerusalem, it, was, possibly, intended, as, a, monument, of, victory, over, the, christians, that, would, distinguish, islam, s, uniqueness, within, the, common, abrahamic, setting, of, jerusalem, home, of, the, two, older, abrahamic, faiths, judaism, and, christianity, an, alternative, motive, may, have, been, to, divert, the, religious, focus, of, muslims, in, the, umayyad, realm, from, the, ka, aba, in, zubayrid, mecca, 683, 692, where, the, umayyads, were, routinely, condemned,

end, of, roman, power, in, africa, according, to, kennedy, kairouan, was, firmly, secured, as, a, launchpad, for, later, conquests, while, the, port, town, of, tunis, was, founded, and, equipped,

715, despite, the, distance, from, the, arab, garrison, towns, of, khurasan, the, unfavorable, terrain, and, climate, and, his, enemies, numerical, superiority, qutayba, through, his, persistent, raids, gained, the, surrender, of, bukhara, in, 706, 709, khwarazm, and, samarkand, in, 711, 712, and, farghana, in, 713, he, established, arab, garrisons, and, tax, administrations, in, samarkand,

northwestern, south, asia, and, established, out, of, this, new, territory, the, province, of, sind, the, massive, war, spoils, netted, by, the, conquests, of, transoxiana, sind, and, hispania, were, comparable, to, the, amounts, accrued, in, the, early, muslim, conquests, during, the, reign, of, caliph, umar, al, walid, i, s, successor, his, brother, sulayman, r, 715, 717, continued, his, predecessors, militarist, policies, but, expansion, mostly, ground, to, a, halt, during, his, reign, the, deaths, of, al, hajjaj, in, 714, and, qutayba, in, 715, left, the, arab, armies, in, transoxiana, in, disarray, for, the, next, twenty, five, years, no, further, eastward, conquests, were, undertaken, and, the, arabs, lost, territory, the, tang, chinese, defeated, the, arabs, at, the, battle, of, aksu, in, 717, forcing, their, withdrawal, to, tashkent, meanwhile, in, 716, the, governor, of, khurasan, yazid, ibn, al, muhallab, attempted, to, conquer, the, principalities, of, jurjan, and, tabaristan, along, the, southern, caspian, coast, his, khurasani, and, iraqi, troops, were, reinforced, by, syrians, marking, their, first, deployment, to, khurasan, but, the, arabs, initial, successes, were, reversed, by, the, local, iranian, coalition, of, farrukhan, the, great, afterward, the, arabs, withdrew, in, return, for, a, tributary, agreement, on, the, byzantine, front,

hubayra, al, fazari, launched, a, naval, campaign, against, the, city, the, byzantines, destroyed, the, umayyad, fleets, and, defeated, maslama, s, army, prompting, his, withdrawal, to, syria, in, 718, the, massive, losses, incurred, during, the, campaign, led, to, a, partial, retrenchment, of, umayyad, forces, from, the, captured, byzantine, frontier, districts, but, already, in, 720, umayyad, raids, against, byzantium, recommenced, nevertheless, the, goal, of, conquering, constantinople, was, effectively, abandoned, and, the, frontier, between, the, two, empires, stabilized, along, the, line, of, the, taurus, and, anti, taurus, mountains, over, which, both, sides, continued, to, launch, regular, raids, and, counter, raids, during, the, next, centuries, contrary, to, expectations, of, a, son, or, brother, succeeding, him, sulayman, had, nominated, his, cousin, umar, ibn, abd, al, aziz, as, his, successor, and, he, took, office, in, 717, after, the, arabs, severe, losses, in, the, offensive, against, constantinople, umar, drew, down, arab, forces, on, the, caliphate, s, war, fronts, though, narbonne, in, modern, france, was, conquered, during, his, reign, to, maintain, stronger, oversight, in, the, provinces, umar, dismissed, all, his, predecessors, governors, his, new, appointees, being, generally, competent, men, he, could, control, to, that, end, the, massive, viceroyalty, of, iraq, and, the, east, was, broken, up, umar, s, most, significant, policy, entailed, fiscal, reforms, to, equalize, the, status, of, the, arabs, and, mawali, thus, remedying, a, long, standing, issue, which, threatened, the, muslim, community, the, jizya, poll, tax, on, the, mawali, was, eliminated, hitherto, the, jizya, which, was, traditionally, reserved, for, the, non, muslim, majorities, of, the, caliphate, continued, to, be, imposed, on, non, arab, converts, to, islam, while, all, muslims, who, cultivated, conquered, lands, were, liable, to, pay, the, kharaj, land, tax, since, avoidance, of, taxation, incentivized, both, mass, conversions, to, islam, and, abandonment, of, land, for, migration, to, the, garrison, cities, it, put, a, strain, on, tax, revenues, especially, in, egypt, iraq, and, khurasan, thus, the, umayyad, rulers, had, a, vested, interest, in, preventing, the, conquered, peoples, from, accepting, islam, or, forcing, them, to, continue, paying, those, taxes, from, which, they, claimed, exemption, as, muslims, according, to, hawting, to, prevent, a, collapse, in, revenue, the, converts, lands, would, become, the, property, of, their, villages, and, remain, liable, for, the, full, rate, of, the, kharaj, in, tandem, umar, intensified, the, islamization, drive, of, his, marwanid, predecessors, enacting, measures, to, distinguish, muslims, from, non, muslims, and, inaugurating, islamic, iconoclasm, his, position, among, the, umayyad, caliphs, is, unusual, in, that, he, became, the, only, one, to, have, been, recognized, in, subsequent, islamic, tradition, as, a, genuine, caliph, khalifa, and, not, merely, as, a, worldly, king, malik, after, the, death, of, umar, ii, another, son, of, abd, al, malik, yazid, ii, r, 720,

equalization, reforms, reimposing, the, jizya, on, the, mawali, which, sparked, revolts, in, khurasan, in, 721, or, 722, that, persisted, for, some, twenty, years, and, met, strong, resistance, among, the, berbers, of, ifriqiya, where, the, umayyad, governor, was, assassinated, by, his, discontented, berber, guards, warfare, on, the, frontiers, was, also, resumed, with, renewed, annual, raids, against, the, byzantines, and, the, khazars, in, transcaucasia, the, final, son, of, abd, al, malik, to, become, caliph, was, hisham, r, 724, 743, whose, long, and, eventful, reign, was, above, all, marked, by, the, curtailment, of, military, expansion, hisham, established, his, court, at, resafa, in, northern, syria, which, was, closer, to, the, byzantine, border, than, damascus, and, resumed, hostilities, against, the, byzantines, which, had, lapsed, following, the, failure, of, the, last, siege, of, constantinople, the, new, campaigns, resulted, in, a, number, of, successful, raids, into, anatolia, but, also, in, a, major, defeat, the, battle, of, akroinon, and, did, not, lead, to, any, significant, territorial, expansion, from, the, caliphate, s, north, western, african, bases, a,

battle, of, tours, in, 732, arab, expansion, had, already, been, limited, following, the, battle, of, toulouse, in, 721, in, 739, a, major, berber, revolt, broke, out, in, north, africa, which, was, probably, the, largest, military, setback, in, the, reign, of, caliph, hisham, from, it, emerged, some, of, the, first, muslim, states, outside, the, caliphate, it, is, also, regarded, as, the, beginning, of, moroccan, independence, as, morocco, would, never, again, come, under, the, rule, of, an, eastern, caliph, or, any, other, foreign, power, until, the, 20th, century, it, was, followed, by, the, collapse, of, umayyad, authority, in, al, andalus, in, india, the, umayyad, armies, were, defeated, by, the, south, indian, chalukya, dynasty, and, by, the, north, indian, pratiharas,

launched, several, invasions, of, the, northern, caucasus, but, failed, to, subdue, the, nomadic, khazars, the, conflict, was, arduous, and, bloody, and, the, arab, army, even, suffered, a, major, defeat, at, the, battle, of, marj, ardabil, in, 730, marwan, ibn, muhammad, the, future, marwan, ii, finally, ended, the, war, in, 737, with, a, massive, invasion, that, is, reported, to, have, reached, as, far, as, the, volga, but, the, khazars, remained, unsubdued, hisham, suffered, still, worse, defeats, in, the, east, where, his, armies, attempted, to, subdue, both, tokharistan, with, its, centre, at, balkh, and, transoxiana, with, its, centre, at, samarkand, both, areas, had, already, been, partially, conquered, but, remained, difficult, to, govern, once, again, a, particular, difficulty, concerned, the, question, of, the, conversion, of, non, arabs, especially, the, sogdians, of, transoxiana, following, the, umayyad, defeat, in, the, day, of, thirst, in, 724, ashras, ibn, abd, allah, al, sulami, governor, of, khurasan, promised, tax, relief, to, those, sogdians, who, converted, to, islam, but, went, back, on, his, offer, when, it, proved, too, popular, and, threatened, to, reduce, tax, revenues, discontent, among, the, khorasani, arabs, rose, sharply, after, the, losses, suffered, in, the, battle, of, the, defile, in, 731, in, 734, al, harith, ibn, surayj, led, a, revolt, that, received, broad, backing, from, arabs, and, natives, alike, capturing, balkh, but, failing, to, take, merv, after, this, defeat, al, harith, s, movement, seems, to, have, been, dissolved, the, problem, of, the, rights, of, non, arab, muslims, would, continue, to, plague, the, umayyads, hisham, was, succeeded, by, al, walid, ii, 743, 44, the, son, of, yazid, ii, al, walid, is, reported, to, have, been, more, interested, in, earthly, pleasures, than, in, religion, a, reputation, that, may, be, confirmed, by, the, decoration, of, the, so, called, desert, palaces, including, qusayr, amra, and, khirbat, al, mafjar, that, have, been, attributed, to, him, he, quickly, attracted, the, enmity, of, many, both, by, executing, a, number, of, those, who, had, opposed, his, accession, and, by, persecuting, the, qadariyya, in, 744, yazid, iii, a, son, of, al, walid, i, was, proclaimed, caliph, in, damascus, and, his, army, tracked, down, and, killed, al, walid, ii, yazid, iii, has, received, a, certain, reputation, for, piety, and, may, have, been, sympathetic, to, the, qadariyya, he, died, a, mere, six, months, into, his, reign, yazid, had, appointed, his, brother, ibrahim, as, his, successor, but, marwan, ii, 744, 50, the, grandson, of, marwan, i, led, an, army, from, the, northern, frontier, and, entered, damascus, in, december, 744, where, he, was, proclaimed, caliph, marwan, immediately, moved, the, capital, north, to, harran, in, present, day, turkey, a, rebellion, soon, broke, out, in, syria, perhaps, due, to, resentment, over, the, relocation, of, the, capital, and, in, 746, marwan, razed, the, walls, of, homs, and, damascus, in, retaliation, marwan, also, faced, significant, opposition, from, kharijites, in, iraq, and, iran, who, put, forth, first, dahhak, ibn, qays, and, then, abu, dulaf, as, rival, caliphs, in, 747, marwan, managed, to, reestablish, control, of, iraq, but, by, this, time, a, more, serious, threat, had, arisen, in, khorasan, the, hashimiyya, movement, a, sub, sect, of, the, kaysanites, shia, led, by, the, abbasid, family, overthrew, the, umayyad, caliphate, the, abbasids, were, members, of, the, hashim, clan, rivals, of, the, umayyads, but, the, word, hashimiyya, seems, to, refer, specifically, to, abu, hashim, a, grandson, of, ali, and, son, of, muhammad, ibn, al, hanafiyya, according, to, certain, traditions, abu, hashim, died, in, 717, in, humeima, in, the, house, of, muhammad, ibn, ali, the, head, of, the, abbasid, family, and, before, dying, named, muhammad, ibn, ali, as, his, successor, this, tradition, allowed, the, abbasids, to, rally, the, supporters, of, the, failed, revolt, of, mukhtar, who, had, represented, themselves, as, the, supporters, of, muhammad, ibn, al, hanafiyya, beginning, around, 719, hashimiyya, missions, began, to, seek, adherents, in, khurasan, their, campaign, was, framed, as, one, of, proselytism, dawah, they, sought, support, for, a, member, of, the, family, of, muhammad, without, making, explicit, mention, of, the, abbasids, these, missions, met, with, success, both, among, arabs, and, non, arabs, mawali, although, the, latter, may, have, played, a, particularly, important, role, in, the, growth, of, the, movement, around, 746, abu, muslim, assumed, leadership, of, the, hashimiyya, in, khurasan, in, 747, he, successfully, initiated, an, open, revolt, against, umayyad, rule, which, was, carried, out, under, the, sign, of, the, black, flag, he, soon, established, control, of, khurasan, expelling, its, umayyad, governor, nasr, ibn, sayyar, and, dispatched, an, army, westwards, kufa, fell, to, the, hashimiyya, in, 749, the, last, umayyad, stronghold, in, iraq, wasit, was, placed, under, siege, and, in, november, of, the, same, year, abul, abbas, as, saffah, was, recognized, as, the, new, caliph, in, the, mosque, at, kufa, at, this, point, marwan, mobilized, his, troops, from, harran, and, advanced, toward, iraq, in, january, 750, the, two, forces, met, in, the, battle, of, the, zab, and, the, umayyads, were, defeated, damascus, fell, to, the, abbasids, in, april, and, in, august, marwan, was, killed, in, egypt, some, umayyads, in, syria, continued, to, resist, the, takeover, the, umayyad, princes, abu, muhammad, al, sufyani, al, abbas, ibn, muhammad, and, hashim, ibn, yazid, launched, revolts, in, syria, and, the, islamic, byzantine, frontier, around, late, 750, but, they, were, defeated, the, victors, desecrated, the, tombs, of, the, umayyads, in, syria, sparing, only, that, of, umar, ii, and, most, of, the, remaining, members, of, the, umayyad, family, were, tracked, down, and, killed, when, abbasids, declared, amnesty, for, members, of, the, umayyad, family, eighty, gathered, to, receive, pardons, and, all, were, massacred, one, grandson, of, hisham, abd, al, rahman, i, survived, escaped, across, north, africa, and, established, an, emirate, in, moorish, iberia, al, andalus, in, a, claim, unrecognized, outside, of, al, andalus, he, maintained, that, the, umayyad, caliphate, the, true, authentic, caliphate, more, legitimate, than, the, abbasids, was, continued, through, him, in, c, rdoba, it, was, to, survive, for, centuries, some, umayyads, also, survived, in, syria, and, their, descendants, would, once, more, attempt, to, restore, their, old, regime, during, the, fourth, fitna, two, umayyads, abu, al, umaytir, al, sufyani, and, maslama, ibn, ya, qub, successively, seized, control, of, damascus, from, 811, to, 813, and, declared, themselves, caliphs, however, their, rebellions, were, suppressed, previt, orton, argues, that, the, reason, for, the, decline, of, the, umayyads, was, the, rapid, expansion, of, islam, during, the, umayyad, period, mass, conversions, brought, persians, berbers, copts, and, aramaic, to, islam, these, mawalis, clients, were, often, better, educated, and, more, civilised, than, their, arab, overlords, the, new, converts, on, the, basis, of, equality, of, all, muslims, transformed, the, political, landscape, previt, orton, also, argues, that, the, feud, between, syria, and, iraq, further, weakened, the, empire, the, first, four, caliphs, created, a, stable, administration, for, the, empire, following, the, practices, and, administrative, institutions, of, the, byzantine, empire, which, had, ruled, the, same, region, previously, these, consisted, of, four, main, governmental, branches, political, affairs, military, affairs, tax, collection, and, religious, administration, each, of, these, was, further, subdivided, into, more, branches, offices, and, departments, geographically, the, empire, was, divided, into, several, provinces, the, borders, of, which, changed, numerous, times, during, the, umayyad, reign, each, province, had, a, governor, appointed, by, the, caliph, the, governor, was, in, charge, of, the, religious, officials, army, leaders, police, and, civil, administrators, in, his, province, local, expenses, were, paid, for, by, taxes, coming, from, that, province, with, the, remainder, each, year, being, sent, to, the, central, government, in, damascus, as, the, central, power, of, the, umayyad, rulers, waned, in, the, later, years, of, the, dynasty, some, governors, neglected, to, send, the, extra, tax, revenue, to, damascus, and, created, great, personal, fortunes, as, the, empire, grew, the, number, of, qualified, arab, workers, was, too, small, to, keep, up, with, the, rapid, expansion, of, the, empire, therefore, muawiya, allowed, many, of, the, local, government, workers, in, conquered, provinces, to, keep, their, jobs, under, the, new, umayyad, government, thus, much, of, the, local, government, s, work, was, recorded, in, greek, coptic, and, persian, it, was, only, during, the, reign, of, abd, al, malik, that, government, work, began, to, be, regularly, recorded, in, arabic, the, umayyad, army, was, mainly, arab, with, its, core, consisting, of, those, who, had, settled, in, urban, syria, and, the, arab, tribes, who, originally, served, in, the, army, of, the, eastern, roman, empire, in, syria, these, were, supported, by, tribes, in, the, syrian, desert, and, in, the, frontier, with, the, byzantines, as, well, as, christian, syrian, tribes, soldiers, were, registered, with, the, army, ministry, the, diwan, al, jaysh, and, were, salaried, the, army, was, divided, into, junds, based, on, regional, fortified, cities, the, umayyad, syrian, forces, specialised, in, close, order, infantry, warfare, and, favoured, using, a, kneeling, spear, wall, formation, in, battle, probably, as, a, result, of, their, encounters, with, roman, armies, this, was, radically, different, from, the, original, bedouin, style, of, mobile, and, individualistic, fighting, the, byzantine, and, sassanid, empires, relied, on, money, economies, before, the, muslim, conquest, and, that, system, remained, in, effect, during, the, umayyad, period, byzantine, coinage, was, used, until, 658, byzantine, gold, coins, were, still, in, use, until, the, monetary, reforms, c, 700, in, addition, to, this, the, umayyad, government, began, to, mint, its, own, coins, in, damascus, which, were, initially, similar, to, pre, existing, coins, but, evolved, in, an, independent, direction, these, were, the, first, coins, minted, by, a, muslim, government, in, history, early, islamic, coins, re, used, byzantine, and, sasanian, iconography, directly, but, added, new, islamic, elements, so, called, arab, byzantine, coins, replicated, byzantine, coins, and, were, minted, in, levantine, cities, before, and, after, the, umayyads, rose, to, power, some, examples, of, these, coins, likely, minted, in, damascus, copied, the, coins, of, byzantine, emperor, heraclius, including, a, depiction, of, the, emperor, and, his, son, heraclius, constantine, on, the, reverse, side, the, traditional, byzantine, cross, on, steps, image, was, modified, to, avoid, any, explicitly, non, islamic, connotation, in, the, 690s, under, abd, al, malik, s, reign, a, new, period, of, experimentations, began, some, arab, sasanian, coins, dated, between, 692, and, 696, associated, with, the, mints, in, iraq, under, governor, bishr, ibn, marwan, stopped, using, the, sasanian, image, of, the, fire, altar, and, replaced, it, with, three, male, figures, standing, in, arab, dress, this, was, possibly, an, attempt, to, depict, the, act, of, muslim, prayer, or, the, delivery, of, the, khutba, friday, sermon, another, coin, minted, probably, between, 695, and, 698, features, the, image, of, a, spear, under, an, arch, this, has, been, variously, interpreted, as, representing, a, mihrab, or, a, sacral, arch, the, latter, being, a, late, antique, motif, the, spear, is, believed, to, be, the, spear, anaza, that, muhammad, carried, before, him, when, entering, the, mosque, between, 696, and, 699, the, caliph, introduced, a, new, system, of, coinage, of, gold, silver, and, bronze, the, coins, generally, featured, arabic, inscriptions, without, any, images, ending, the, earlier, iconographic, traditions, the, main, gold, unit, was, the, dinar, from, roman, denarius, which, was, worth, 20, silver, coins, it, was, most, likely, modeled, on, the, byzantine, solidus, the, silver, coin, was, called, a, dirham, from, greek, drachma, its, size, and, shape, was, based, on, sasanian, coins, and, they, were, minted, in, much, larger, quantities, than, in, the, earlier, byzantine, era, the, bronze, coin, was, called, a, fals, or, fulus, from, byzantine, follis, one, group, of, bronze, coins, from, palestine, dated, after, the, coinage, reform, of, the, late, 690s, features, the, image, of, a, seven, branched, menorah, and, then, later, of, a, five, branched, menorah, topped, by, an, arabic, inscription, of, the, shahada, these, images, may, have, been, based, on, christian, representations, of, the, menorah, or, on, earlier, hasmonean, models, the, switch, to, a, five, branched, version, may, have, been, intended, to, further, differentiate, this, depiction, from, jewish, and, christian, versions, to, assist, the, caliph, in, administration, there, were, six, boards, at, the, centre, diwan, al, kharaj, the, board, of, revenue, diwan, al, rasa, il, the, board, of, correspondence, diwan, al, khatam, the, board, of, signet, diwan, al, barid, the, board, of, posts, diwan, al, qudat, the, board, of, justice, and, diwan, al, jund, the, military, board, the, central, board, of, revenue, administered, the, entire, finances, of, the, empire, it, also, imposed, and, collected, taxes, and, disbursed, revenue, a, regular, board, of, correspondence, was, established, under, the, umayyads, it, issued, state, missives, and, circulars, to, the, central, and, provincial, officers, it, coordinated, the, work, of, all, boards, and, dealt, with, all, correspondence, as, the, chief, secretariat, in, order, to, reduce, forgery, diwan, al, khatam, bureau, of, registry, a, kind, of, state, chancellery, was, instituted, by, mu, awiyah, it, used, to, make, and, preserve, a, copy, of, each, official, document, before, sealing, and, despatching, the, original, to, its, destination, thus, in, the, course, of, time, a, state, archive, developed, in, damascus, by, the, umayyads, under, abd, al, malik, this, department, survived, till, the, middle, of, the, abbasid, period, mu, awiyah, introduced, the, postal, service, abd, al, malik, extended, it, throughout, his, empire, and, walid, made, full, use, of, it, umar, bin, abdul, aziz, developed, it, further, by, building, caravanserais, at, stages, along, the, khurasan, highway, relays, of, horses, were, used, for, the, conveyance, of, dispatches, between, the, caliph, and, his, agents, and, officials, posted, in, the, provinces, the, main, highways, were, divided, into, stages, of, 12, miles, 19, km, each, and, each, stage, had, horses, donkeys, or, camels, ready, to, carry, the, post, primarily, the, service, met, the, needs, of, government, officials, but, travellers, and, their, important, dispatches, were, also, benefited, by, the, system, the, postal, carriages, were, also,

dabbabah, or, kabsh, battering, ram, the, heavy, engines, siege, machines, and, baggage, were, carried, on, camels, behind, the, army, the, umayyad, caliphate, had, four, main, social, classes, the, muslim, arabs, were, at, the, top, of, the, society, and, saw, it, as, their, duty, to, rule, over, the, conquered, areas, the, arab, muslims, held, themselves, in, higher, esteem, than, muslim, non, arabs, and, generally, did, not, mix, with, other, muslims, as, islam, spread, more, and, more, of, the, muslim, population, consisted, of, non, arabs, this, caused, social, unrest, as, the, new, converts, were, not, given, the, same, rights, as, muslim, arabs, also, as, conversions, increased, tax, revenues, peasant, tax, from, non, muslims, decreased, to, dangerous, lows, these, issues, continued, to, worsen, until, they, helped, cause, the, abbasid, revolt, in, the, 740s, non, muslim, groups, in, the, umayyad, caliphate, which, included, christians, jews, zoroastrians, and, pagans, were, called, dhimmis, they, were, given, a, legally, protected, status, as, second, class, citizens, as, long, as, they, accepted, and, acknowledged, the, political, supremacy, of, the, ruling, muslims, more, specifically, non, muslims, had, to, pay, a, tax, known, as, jizya, which, the, muslims, did, not, have, to, pay, muslims, would, instead, pay, the, zakat, tax, if, non, muslims, converted, to, islam, they, would, cease, paying, jizya, and, would, instead, pay, zakat, although, the, umayyads, were, harsh, when, it, came, to, defeating, their, zoroastrian, adversaries, they, did, offer, protection, and, relative, religious, tolerance, to, the, zoroastrians, who, accepted, their, authority, as, a, matter, of, fact, umar, ii, was, reported, to, have, said, in, one, of, his, letters, commanding, not, to, destroy, a, synagogue, or, a, church, or, temple, of, fire, worshippers, meaning, the, zoroastrians, as, long, as, they, have, reconciled, with, and, agreed, upon, with, the, muslims, fred, donner, says, that, zoroastrians, in, the, northern, parts, of, iran, were, hardly, penetrated, by, the, believers, winning, virtually, complete, autonomy, in, return, for, tribute, tax, or, jizyah, donner, adds, zoroastrians, continued, to, exist, in, large, numbers, in, northern, and, western, iran, and, elsewhere, for, centuries, after, the, rise, of, islam, and, indeed, much, of, the, canon, of, zoroastrian, religious, texts, was, elaborated, and, written, down, during, the, islamic, period, christians, and, jews, still, continued, to, produce, great, theological, thinkers, within, their, communities, but, as, time, wore, on, many, of, the, intellectuals, converted, to, islam, leading, to, a, lack, of, great, thinkers, in, the, non, muslim, communities, important, christian, writers, from, the, umayyad, period, include, the, theologian, john, of, damascus, bishop, cosmas, of, maiuma, pope, benjamin, i, of, alexandria, and, isaac, of, nineveh, although, non, muslims, could, not, hold, the, highest, public, offices, in, the, empire, they, held, many, bureaucratic, positions, within, the, government, an, important, example, of, christian, employment, in, the, umayyad, government, is, that, of, sarjun, ibn, mansur, he, was, a, melkite, christian, official, of, the, early, umayyad, caliphate, the, son, of, a, prominent, byzantine, official, of, damascus, he, was, a, favourite, of, the, early, umayyad, caliphs, mu, awiya, i, and, yazid, i, and, served, as, the, head, of, the, fiscal, administration, for, syria, from, the, mid, 7th, century, until, the, year, 700, when, caliph, abd, al, malik, ibn, marwan, dismissed, him, as, part, of, his, efforts, to, arabicize, the, administration, of, the, caliphate, according, to, the, muslim, historians, al, baladhuri, and, al, tabari, sarjun, was, a, mawla, of, the, first, umayyad, caliph, mu, awiya, i, r, 661, 680, serving, as, his, secretary, and, the, person, in, charge, of, his, business, the, hagiographies, although, less, reliable, also, assign, to, him, a, role, in, the, administration, even, as, ruler, archon, or, even, amir, of, damascus, and, its, environs, where, he, was, responsible, for, collecting, the, revenue, in, this, capacity, he, is, attested, in, later, collections, of, source, material, such, as, that, of, al, mas, udi, sarjun, ibn, mansur, was, replaced, by, sulayman, ibn, sa, d, al, khushani, another, christian, muawiya, s, marriage, to, maysun, bint, bahdal, yazid, s, mother, was, politically, motivated, as, she, was, the, daughter, of, the, chief, of, the, kalb, tribe, which, was, a, large, syriac, orthodox, christian, arab, tribe, in, syria, the, kalb, tribe, had, remained, largely, neutral, when, the, muslims, first, went, into, syria, after, the, plague, that, killed, much, of, the, muslim, army, in, syria, by, marrying, maysun, muawiyah, used, the, syriac, orthodox, christians, against, the, byzantines, tom, holland, writes, that, christians, jews, samaritans, and, manichaeans, were, all, treated, well, by, muawiyah, muawiyah, even, restored, edessa, s, cathedral, after, it, had, been, toppled, by, an, earthquake, holland, also, writes, that, savagely, though, muawiyah, prosecuted, his, wars, against, the, romans, yet, his, subjects, no, longer, trampled, by, rival, armies, no, longer, divided, by, hostile, watchtowers, knew, only, peace, at, last, justice, flourished, in, his, time, and, there, was, great, peace, in, the, regions, under, his, control, he, allowed, everyone, to, live, as, they, wanted, the, umayyads, constructed, grand, congregational, mosques, and, palaces, within, their, empire, most, of, their, surviving, monuments, are, located, in, the, levant, region, their, main, base, of, power, they, also, continued, the, existing, muslim, policy, of, building, new, garrison, cities, amsar, in, their, provinces, that, served, as, bases, for, further, expansion, their, most, famous, constructions, include, the, dome, of, the, rock, in, jerusalem, and, the, great, mosque, of, damascus, while, other, constructions, include, the, so, called, desert, palaces, such, as, khirbat, al, majfar, and, qusayr, amra, among, these, projects, the, construction, of, the, great, mosque, in, damascus, reflected, the, diversity, of, the, empire, as, greek, persian, coptic, indian, and, maghrebi, craftsmen, were, recruited, to, build, it, under, umayyad, patronage, islamic, architecture, was, derived, from, established, byzantine, and, sasanian, architectural, traditions, but, it, also, innovated, by, combining, elements, of, these, styles, together, experimenting, with, new, building, types, and, implementing, lavish, decorative, programs, byzantine, style, mosaics, are, prominently, featured, in, both, the, dome, of, the, rock, and, the, great, mosque, of, damascus, but, the, lack, of, human, figures, in, their, imagery, was, a, new, trait, that, demonstrates, an, islamic, taboo, on, figural, representation, in, religious, art, palaces, were, decorated, with, floor, mosaics, frescoes, and, relief, carving, and, some, of, these, included, representations, of, human, figures, and, animals, umayyad, architecture, was, thus, an, important, transitional, period, during, which, early, islamic, architecture, and, visual, culture, began, to, develop, its, own, distinct, identity, the, later, offshoot, of, the, umayyad, dynasty, in, al, andalus, which, ruled, the, emirate, and, subsequent, caliphate, of, c, rdoba, also, undertook, major, architectural, projects, in, the, iberian, peninsula, such, as, the, great, mosque, of, c, rdoba, and, madinat, al, zahra, which, influenced, later, architecture, in, the, western, islamic, world, the, umayyad, caliphate, was, marked, both, by, territorial, expansion, and, by, the, administrative, and, cultural, problems, that, such, expansion, created, despite, some, notable, exceptions, the, umayyads, tended, to, favor, the, rights, of, the, old, arab, families, and, in, particular, their, own, over, those, of, newly, converted, muslims, mawali, therefore, they, held, to, a, less, universalist, conception, of, islam, than, did, many, of, their, rivals, as, g, r, hawting, has, written, islam, was, in, fact, regarded, as, the, property, of, the, conquering, aristocracy, during, the, period, of, the, umayyads, arabic, became, the, administrative, language, and, the, process, of, arabization, was, initiated, in, the, levant, mesopotamia, north, africa, and, iberia, state, documents, and, currency, were, issued, in, arabic, mass, conversions, also, created, a, growing, population, of, muslims, in, the, territory, of, the, caliphate, according, to, one, common, view, the, umayyads, transformed, the, caliphate, from, a, religious, institution, during, the, rashidun, caliphate, to, a, dynastic, one, however, the, umayyad, caliphs, do, seem, to, have, understood, themselves, as, the, representatives, of, god, on, earth, and, to, have, been, responsible, for, the, definition, and, elaboration, of, god, s, ordinances, or, in, other, words, the, definition, or, elaboration, of, islamic, law, the, umayyads, have, met, with, a, largely, negative, reception, from, later, islamic, historians, who, have, accused, them, of, promoting, a, kingship, mulk, a, term, with, connotations, of, tyranny, instead, of, a, true, caliphate, khilafa, in, this, respect, it, is, notable, that, the, umayyad, caliphs, referred, to, themselves, not, as, khalifat, rasul, allah, successor, of, the, messenger, of, god, the, title, preferred, by, the, tradition, but, rather, as, khalifat, allah, deputy, of, god, the, distinction, seems, to, indicate, that, the, umayyads, regarded, themselves, as, god, s, representatives, at, the, head, of, the, community, and, saw, no, need, to, share, their, religious, power, with, or, delegate, it, to, the, emergent, class, of, religious, scholars, in, fact, it, was, precisely, this, class, of, scholars, based, largely, in, iraq, that, was, responsible, for, collecting, and, recording, the, traditions, that, form, the, primary, source, material, for, the, history, of, the, umayyad, period, in, reconstructing, this, history, therefore, it, is, necessary, to, rely, mainly, on, sources, such, as, the, histories, of, tabari, and, baladhuri, that, were, written, in, the, abbasid, court, at, baghdad, the, book, al, muwatta, by, imam, malik, was, written, in, the, early, abbasid, period, in, medina, it, does, not, contain, any, anti, umayyad, content, because, it, was, more, concerned, with, what, the, quran, and, what, muhammad, said, and, was, not, a, history, book, on, the, umayyads, even, the, earliest, pro, shia, accounts, of, al, masudi, are, more, balanced, al, masudi, s, ibn, hisham, is, the, earliest, shia, account, of, muawiyah, he, recounted, that, muawiyah, spent, a, great, deal, of, time, in, prayer, in, spite, of, the, burden, of, managing, a, large, empire, after, killing, off, most, of, the, umayyads, and, destroying, the, graves, of, the, umayyad, rulers, apart, from, muawiyah, and, umar, ibn, abd, al, aziz, the, history, books, were, written, during, the, later, abbasid, period, are, more, anti, umayyad, the, books, written, later, in, the, abbasid, period, in, iran, are, more, anti, umayyad, iran, was, sunni, at, the, time, there, was, much, anti, arab, feeling, in, iran, after, the, fall, of, the, persian, empire, modern, arab, nationalism, regards, the, period, of, the, umayyads, as, part, of, the, arab, golden, age, which, it, sought, to, emulate, and, restore, this, is, particularly, true, of, syrian, nationalists, and, the, present, day, state, of, syria, centered, like, that, of, the, umayyads, on, damascus, the, umayyad, banners, were, white, after, the, banner, of, muawiya, ibn, abi, sufyan, it, is, now, one, of, the, four, pan, arab, colours, which, appear, in, various, combinations, on, the, flags, of, most, arab, countries, many, muslims, criticized, the, umayyads, for, having, too, many, non, muslim, former, roman, administrators, in, their, government, e, g, st, john, of, damascus, as, the, muslims, took, over, cities, they, left, the, people, s, political, representatives, the, roman, tax, collectors, and, the, administrators, in, the, office, the, taxes, to, the, central, government, were, calculated, and, negotiated, by, the, people, s, political, representatives, both, the, central, and, local, governments, were, compensated, for, the, services, each, provided, many, christian, cities, used, some, of, the, taxes, to, maintain, their, churches, and, run, their, own, organizations, later, the, umayyads, were, criticized, by, some, muslims, for, not, reducing, the, taxes, of, the, people, who, converted, to, islam, later, when, umar, ibn, abd, al, aziz, came, to, power, he, reduced, these, taxes, he, is, therefore, praised, as, one, of, the, greatest, muslim, rulers, after, the, four, rightly, guided, caliphs, imam, abu, muhammad, abdullah, ibn, abdul, hakam, who, lived, in, 829, and, wrote, a, biography, on, umar, ibn, abdul, aziz, stated, that, the, reduction, in, these, taxes, stimulated, the, economy, and, created, wealth, but, it, also, reduced, the, government, s, budget, including, eventually, the, defence, budget, the, only, umayyad, ruler, who, is, unanimously, praised, by, sunni, sources, for, his, devout, piety, and, justice, is, umar, ibn, abd, al, aziz, in, his, efforts, to, spread, islam, he, established, liberties, for, the, mawali, by, abolishing, the, jizya, tax, for, converts, to, islam, imam, abu, muhammad, abdullah, ibn, abdul, hakam, stated, that, umar, ibn, abd, al, aziz, also, stopped, the, personal, allowance, offered, to, his, relatives, stating, that, he, could, only, give, them, an, allowance, if, he, gave, an, allowance, to, everyone, else, in, the, empire, after, umar, ibn, abd, al, aziz, was, poisoned, in, 720, successive, governments, tried, to, reverse, umar, ibn, abd, al, aziz, s, tax, policies, but, rebellion, resulted, the, negative, view, of, the, umayyads, held, by, shias, is, briefly, expressed, in, the, shi, a, book, sulh, al, hasan, according, to, shia, hadiths, which, are, not, considered, authentic, by, sunnis, ali, described, them, as, the, worst, fitna, in, shia, sources, the, umayyad, caliphate, is, widely, described, as, tyrannical, anti, islamic, and, godless, shias, point, out, that, the, founder, of, the, dynasty, muawiyah, declared, himself, a, caliph, in, 657, and, went, to, war, against, muhammad, s, son, in, law, and, cousin, the, ruling, caliph, ali, clashing, at, the, battle, of, siffin, muawiyah, also, declared, his, son, yazid, as, his, successor, in, breach, of, a, treaty, with, hassan, muhammad, s, grandson, another, of, muhammad, s, grandsons, husayn, ibn, ali, would, be, killed, by, yazid, in, the, battle, of, karbala, further, shia, imams, ali, ibn, husayn, zayn, al, abidin, would, be, killed, at, the, hands, of, ruling, umayyad, caliphs, asked, for, an, explanation, of, the, prophecies, in, the, book, of, revelation, 12, 3, abdu, l, bah, suggests, in, some, answered, questions, that, the, great, red, dragon, having, seven, heads, and, ten, horns, and, seven, crowns, upon, his, heads, refers, to, the, umayyad, caliphs, who, rose, against, the, religion, of, prophet, muhammad, and, against, the, reality, of, ali, the, seven, heads, of, the, dragon, are, symbolic, of, the, seven, provinces, of, the, lands, dominated, by, the, umayyads, damascus, persia, arabia, egypt, africa, andalusia, and, transoxiana, the, ten, horns, represent, the, ten, names, of, the, leaders, of, the, umayyad, dynasty, abu, sufyan, muawiya, yazid, marwan, abd, al, malik, walid, sulayman, umar, hisham, and, ibrahim, some, names, were, re, used, as, in, the, case, of, yazid, ii, and, yazid, iii, which, were, not, accounted, for, in, this, interpretation
