sparta, was, a, prominent, city, state, in, laconia, in, ancient, greece, in, antiquity, the, city, state, was, known, as, lacedaemon, lakeda, m, n, while, the, name, sparta, referred, to, its, main, settlement, on, the, banks, of, the, eurotas, river, in, the, eurotas, valley, of, laconia, in, south, eastern, peloponnese, around, 650, bc, it, rose, to, become, the, dominant, military, land, power, in, ancient, greece, given, its, military, pre, eminence, sparta, was, recognized, as, the, leading, force, of, the, unified, greek, military, during, the, greco, persian, wars, in, rivalry, with, the, rising, naval, power, of, athens, sparta, was, the, principal, enemy, of, athens, during, the, peloponnesian, war, 431, 404, bc, from, which, it, emerged, victorious, after, the, battle, of, aegospotami, the, decisive, battle, of, leuctra, against, thebes, in, 371, bc, ended, the, spartan, hegemony, although, the, city, state, maintained, its, political, independence, until, its, forced, integration, into, the, achaean, league, in, 192, bc, the, city, nevertheless, recovered, much, autonomy, after, the, roman, conquest, of, greece, in, 146, bc, and, prospered, during, the, roman, empire, as, its, antiquarian, customs, attracted, many, roman, tourists, however, sparta, was, sacked, in, 396, ad, by, the, visigothic, king, alaric, and, underwent, a, long, period, of, decline, especially, in, the, middle, ages, when, many, of, its, citizens, moved, to, mystras, modern, sparta, is, the, capital, of, the, southern, greek, region, of, laconia, and, a, center, for, processing, citrus, and, olives, sparta, was, unique, in, ancient, greece, for, its, social, system, and, constitution, which, were, supposedly, introduced, by, the, semi, mythical, legislator, lycurgus, his, laws, configured, the, spartan, society, to, maximize, military, proficiency, at, all, costs, focusing, all, social, institutions, on, military, training, and, physical, development, the, inhabitants, of, sparta, were, stratified, as, spartiates, citizens, with, full, rights, mothakes, free, non, spartiate, people, descended, from, spartans, perioikoi, free, non, spartiates, and, helots, state, owned, enslaved, non, spartan, locals, spartiate, men, underwent, the, rigorous, agoge, training, regimen, and, spartan, phalanx, brigades, were, widely, considered, to, be, among, the, best, in, battle, spartan, women, enjoyed, considerably, more, rights, than, elsewhere, in, classical, antiquity, sparta, was, frequently, a, subject, of, fascination, in, its, own, day, as, well, as, in, western, culture, following, the, revival, of, classical, learning, the, admiration, of, sparta, is, known, as, laconophilia, bertrand, russell, wrote, sparta, had, a, double, effect, on, greek, thought, through, the, reality, and, through, the, myth, the, reality, enabled, the, spartans, to, defeat, athens, in, war, the, myth, influenced, plato, s, political, theory, and, that, of, countless, subsequent, writers, ideals, that, it, favors, had, a, great, part, in, framing, the, doctrines, of, rousseau, nietzsche, and, national, socialism, the, ancient, greeks, used, one, of, three, words, to, refer, to, the, spartan, city, state, and, its, location, first, sparta, refers, primarily, to, the, main, cluster, of, settlements, in, the, valley, of, the, eurotas, river, the, second, word, lacedaemon, was, often, used, as, an, adjective, and, is, the, name, referenced, in, the, works, of, homer, and, the, historians, herodotus, and, thucydides, the, third, term, laconice, referred, to, the, immediate, area, around, the, town, of, sparta, the, plateau, east, of, the, taygetos, mountains, and, sometimes, to, all, the, regions, under, direct, spartan, control, including, messenia, the, earliest, attested, term, referring, to, lacedaemon, is, the, mycenaean, greek, ra, ke, da, mi, ni, jo, lakedaimonian, written, in, linear, b, syllabic, script, the, equivalent, of, the, later, greek, lakedaimonios, latin, lacedaemonius, herodotus, seems, to, use, lacedaemon, for, the, mycenaean, greek, citadel, at, therapne, in, contrast, to, the, lower, town, of, sparta, this, term, could, be, used, synonymously, with, sparta, but, typically, it, denoted, the, terrain, in, which, the, city, was, located, in, homer, it, is, typically, combined, with, epithets, of, the, countryside, wide, lovely, shining, and, most, often, hollow, and, broken, full, of, ravines, suggesting, the, eurotas, valley, sparta, on, the, other, hand, is, described, as, the, country, of, lovely, women, an, epithet, for, people, the, residents, of, sparta, were, often, called, lacedaemonians, this, epithet, utilized, the, plural, of, the, adjective, lacedaemonius, greek, latin, lacedaemonii, but, also, lacedaemones, the, ancients, sometimes, used, a, back, formation, referring, to, the, land, of, lacedaemon, as, lacedaemonian, country, as, most, words, for, country, were, feminine, the, adjective, was, in, the, feminine, lacedaemonia, lakedaimonia, eventually, the, adjective, came, to, be, used, alone, lacedaemonia, was, not, in, general, use, during, the, classical, period, and, before, it, does, occur, in, greek, as, an, equivalent, of, laconia, and, messenia, during, the, roman, and, early, byzantine, periods, mostly, in, ethnographers, and, lexica, of, place, names, for, example, hesychius, of, alexandria, s, lexicon, 5th, century, ad, defines, agiadae, as, a, place, in, lacedaemonia, named, after, agis, the, actual, transition, may, be, captured, by, isidore, of, seville, s, etymologiae, 7th, century, ad, an, etymological, dictionary, isidore, relied, heavily, on, orosius, historiarum, adversum, paganos, 5th, century, ad, and, eusebius, of, caesarea, s, chronicon, early, 5th, century, ad, as, did, orosius, the, latter, defines, sparta, to, be, lacedaemonia, civitas, but, isidore, defines, lacedaemonia, as, founded, by, lacedaemon, son, of, semele, which, is, consistent, with, eusebius, explanation, there, is, a, rare, use, perhaps, the, earliest, of, lacedaemonia, in, diodorus, siculus, the, library, of, history, but, probably, with, ch, ra, country, suppressed, lakedaimona, was, until, 2006, the, name, of, a, province, in, the, modern, greek, prefecture, of, laconia, sparta, is, located, in, the, region, of, laconia, in, the, south, eastern, peloponnese, ancient, sparta, was, built, on, the, banks, of, the, eurotas, the, largest, river, of, laconia, which, provided, it, with, a, source, of, fresh, water, the, eurotas, valley, was, a, natural, fortress, bounded, to, the, west, by, mt, taygetus, 2, 407, m, and, to, the, east, by, mt, parnon, 1, 935, m, to, the, north, laconia, is, separated, from, arcadia, by, hilly, uplands, reaching, 1000, m, in, altitude, these, natural, defenses, worked, to, sparta, s, advantage, and, protected, it, from, sacking, and, invasion, though, landlocked, sparta, had, a, vassal, harbor, gytheio, on, the, laconian, gulf, lacedaemon, greek, was, a, mythical, king, of, laconia, the, son, of, zeus, by, the, nymph, taygete, he, married, sparta, the, daughter, of, eurotas, by, whom, he, became, the, father, of, amyclas, eurydice, and, asine, as, king, he, named, his, country, after, himself, and, the, city, after, his, wife, he, was, believed, to, have, built, the, sanctuary, of, the, charites, which, stood, between, sparta, and, amyclae, and, to, have, given, to, those, divinities, the, names, of, cleta, and, phaenna, a, shrine, was, erected, to, him, in, the, neighborhood, of, therapne, tyrtaeus, an, archaic, era, spartan, writer, is, the, earliest, source, to, connect, the, origin, myth, of, the, spartans, to, the, lineage, of, the, hero, heracles, later, authors, such, as, diodorus, siculus, herodotus, and, apollodorus, also, made, mention, of, spartans, understanding, themselves, to, be, descendants, of, heracles, thucydides, wrote, suppose, the, city, of, sparta, to, be, deserted, and, nothing, left, but, the, temples, and, the, ground, plan, distant, ages, would, be, very, unwilling, to, believe, that, the, power, of, the, lacedaemonians, was, at, all, equal, to, their, fame, their, city, is, not, built, continuously, and, has, no, splendid, temples, or, other, edifices, it, rather, resembles, a, group, of, villages, like, the, ancient, towns, of, hellas, and, would, therefore, make, a, poor, show, until, the, early, 20th, century, the, chief, ancient, buildings, at, sparta, were, the, theatre, of, which, however, little, showed, above, ground, except, portions, of, the, retaining, walls, the, so, called, tomb, of, leonidas, a, quadrangular, building, perhaps, a, temple, constructed, of, immense, blocks, of, stone, and, containing, two, chambers, the, foundation, of, an, ancient, bridge, over, the, eurotas, the, ruins, of, a, circular, structure, some, remains, of, late, roman, fortifications, several, brick, buildings, and, mosaic, pavements, the, remaining, archaeological, wealth, consisted, of, inscriptions, sculptures, and, other, objects, collected, in, the, local, museum, founded, by, stamatakis, in, 1872, and, enlarged, in, 1907, partial, excavation, of, the, round, building, was, undertaken, in, 1892, and, 1893, by, the, american, school, at, athens, the, structure, has, been, since, found, to, be, a, semicircular, retaining, wall, of, hellenic, origin, that, was, partly, restored, during, the, roman, period, in, 1904, the, british, school, at, athens, began, a, thorough, exploration, of, laconia, and, in, the, following, year, excavations, were, made, at, thalamae, geronthrae, and, angelona, near, monemvasia, in, 1906, excavations, began, in, sparta, itself, a, small, circus, as, described, by, leake, proved, to, be, a, theatre, like, building, constructed, soon, after, 200, ad, around, the, altar, and, in, front, of, the, temple, of, artemis, orthia, it, is, believed, that, musical, and, gymnastic, contests, took, place, here, as, well, as, the, famous, flogging, ordeal, administered, to, spartan, boys, diamastigosis, the, temple, which, can, be, dated, to, the, 2nd, century, bc, rests, on, the, foundation, of, an, older, temple, of, the, 6th, century, and, close, beside, it, were, found, the, remains, of, a, yet, earlier, temple, dating, from, the, 9th, or, even, the, 10th, century, the, votive, offerings, in, clay, amber, bronze, ivory, and, lead, dating, from, the, 9th, to, the, 4th, centuries, bc, which, were, found, in, great, profusion, within, the, precinct, range, supply, invaluable, information, about, early, spartan, art, in, 1907, the, location, of, the, sanctuary, of, athena, of, the, brazen, house, chalkioikos, was, determined, to, be, on, the, acropolis, immediately, above, the, theatre, though, the, actual, temple, is, almost, completely, destroyed, the, site, has, produced, the, longest, extant, archaic, inscription, in, laconia, numerous, bronze, nails, and, plates, and, a, considerable, number, of, votive, offerings, the, city, wall, built, in, successive, stages, from, the, 4th, to, the, 2nd, century, was, traced, for, a, great, part, of, its, circuit, which, measured, 48, stades, or, nearly, 10, km, 6, miles, polyb, 1x, 21, the, late, roman, wall, enclosing, the, acropolis, part, of, which, probably, dates, from, the, years, following, the, gothic, raid, of, 262, ad, was, also, investigated, besides, the, actual, buildings, discovered, a, number, of, points, were, situated, and, mapped, in, a, general, study, of, spartan, topography, based, upon, the, description, of, pausanias, in, terms, of, domestic, archaeology, little, is, known, about, spartan, houses, and, villages, before, the, archaic, period, but, the, best, evidence, comes, from, excavations, at, nichoria, in, messenia, where, postholes, have, been, found, these, villages, were, open, and, consisted, of, small, and, simple, houses, built, with, stone, foundations, and, clay, walls, the, menelaion, is, a, shrine, associated, with, menelaus, located, east, of, sparta, by, the, river, eurotas, on, the, hill, profitis, ilias, coordinates, 37, 03, 57, n, 22, 27, 13, e, 37, 0659, n, 22, 4536, e, 37, 0659, 22, 4536, built, around, the, early, 8th, century, bc, the, spartans, believed, it, had, been, the, former, residence, of, menelaus, in, 1970, the, british, school, in, athens, started, excavations, around, the, menelaion, in, an, attempt, to, locate, mycenaean, remains, in, the, area, among, other, findings, they, uncovered, the, remains, of, two, mycenaean, mansions, and, found, the, first, offerings, dedicated, to, helen, and, menelaus, these, mansions, were, destroyed, by, earthquake, and, fire, and, archaeologists, consider, them, the, possible, palace, of, menelaus, himself, excavations, made, from, the, early, 1990s, to, the, present, suggest, that, the, area, around, the, menelaion, in, the, southern, part, of, the, eurotas, valley, seems, to, have, been, the, center, of, mycenaean, laconia, the, mycenaean, settlement, was, roughly, triangular, in, shape, with, its, apex, pointed, towards, the, north, its, area, was, approximately, equal, to, that, of, the, newer, sparta, but, denudation, has, wreaked, havoc, with, its, buildings, and, nothing, is, left, of, its, original, structures, save, for, ruined, foundations, and, broken, potsherds, the, prehistory, of, sparta, is, difficult, to, reconstruct, because, the, literary, evidence, was, written, far, later, than, the, events, it, describes, and, is, distorted, by, oral, tradition, the, earliest, certain, evidence, of, human, settlement, in, the, region, of, sparta, consists, of, pottery, dating, from, the, middle, neolithic, period, found, in, the, vicinity, of, kouphovouno, some, two, kilometres, 1, 2, miles, south, southwest, of, sparta, this, civilization, seems, to, have, fallen, into, decline, by, the, late, bronze, age, when, according, to, herodotus, macedonian, tribes, from, the, north, called, dorians, by, those, they, conquered, marched, into, the, peloponnese, and, subjugating, the, local, tribes, settled, there, the, dorians, seem, to, have, set, about, expanding, the, frontiers, of, spartan, territory, almost, before, they, had, established, their, own, state, they, fought, against, the, argive, dorians, to, the, east, and, southeast, and, also, the, arcadian, achaeans, to, the, northwest, the, evidence, suggests, that, sparta, relatively, inaccessible, because, of, the, topography, of, the, taygetan, plain, was, secure, from, early, on, it, was, never, fortified, nothing, distinctive, in, the, archaeology, of, the, eurotas, river, valley, identifies, the, dorians, or, the, dorian, spartan, state, the, prehistory, of, the, neolithic, the, bronze, age, and, the, dark, age, the, early, iron, age, at, this, moment, must, be, treated, apart, from, the, stream, of, dorian, spartan, history, the, legendary, period, of, spartan, history, is, believed, to, fall, into, the, dark, age, it, treats, the, mythic, heroes, such, as, the, heraclids, and, the, perseids, offering, a, view, of, the, occupation, of, the, peloponnesus, that, contains, both, fantastic, and, possibly, historical, elements, the, subsequent, proto, historic, period, combining, both, legend, and, historical, fragments, offers, the, first, credible, history, between, the, 8th, and, 7th, centuries, bc, the, spartans, experienced, a, period, of, lawlessness, and, civil, strife, later, attested, by, both, herodotus, and, thucydides, as, a, result, they, carried, out, a, series, of, political, and, social, reforms, of, their, own, society, which, they, later, attributed, to, a, semi, mythical, lawgiver, lycurgus, several, writers, throughout, antiquity, including, herodotus, xenophon, and, plutarch, have, attempted, to, explain, spartan, exceptionalism, as, a, result, of, the, so, called, lycurgan, reforms, xenophon, constitution, of, the, lacedaimonians, chapter, 1, in, the, second, messenian, war, sparta, established, itself, as, a, local, power, in, the, peloponnesus, and, the, rest, of, greece, during, the, following, centuries, sparta, s, reputation, as, a, land, fighting, force, was, unequalled, at, its, peak, around, 500, bc, sparta, had, some, 20, 000, 35, 000, citizens, plus, numerous, helots, and, perioikoi, the, likely, total, of, 40, 000, 50, 000, made, sparta, one, of, the, larger, greek, city, states, however, according, to, thucydides, the, population, of, athens, in, 431, bc, was, 360, 000, 610, 000, making, it, much, larger, in, 480, bc, a, small, force, led, by, king, leonidas, about, 300, full, spartiates, 700, thespians, and, 400, thebans, although, these, numbers, were, lessened, by, earlier, casualties, made, a, legendary, last, stand, at, the, battle, of, thermopylae, against, the, massive, persian, army, led, by, xerxes, the, spartans, received, advance, warning, of, the, persian, invasion, from, their, deposed, king, demaratus, which, prompted, them, to, consult, the, delphic, oracle, according, to, herodotus, the, pythia, proclaimed, that, either, one, of, the, kings, of, sparta, had, to, die, or, sparta, would, be, destroyed, this, prophecy, was, fulfilled, after, king, leonidas, died, in, the, battle, the, superior, weaponry, strategy, and, bronze, armour, of, the, greek, hoplites, and, their, phalanx, fighting, formation, again, proved, their, worth, one, year, later, when, sparta, assembled, its, full, strength, and, led, a, greek, alliance, against, the, persians, at, the, battle, of, plataea, in, 479, bc, the, decisive, greek, victory, at, plataea, put, an, end, to, the, greco, persian, war, along, with, persian, ambitions, to, expand, into, europe, even, though, this, war, was, won, by, a, pan, greek, army, credit, was, given, to, sparta, who, besides, providing, the, leading, forces, at, thermopylae, and, plataea, had, been, the, de, facto, leader, of, the, entire, greek, expedition, in, 464, bc, a, violent, earthquake, occurred, along, the, sparta, faultline, destroying, much, of, what, was, sparta, and, many, other, city, states, in, ancient, greece, this, earthquake, is, marked, by, scholars, as, one, of, the, key, events, that, led, to, the, first, peloponnesian, war, in, later, classical, times, sparta, along, with, athens, thebes, and, persia, were, the, main, powers, fighting, for, supremacy, in, the, northeastern, mediterranean, in, the, course, of, the, peloponnesian, war, sparta, a, traditional, land, power, acquired, a, navy, which, managed, to, overpower, the, previously, dominant, flotilla, of, athens, ending, the, athenian, empire, at, the, peak, of, its, power, in, the, early, 4th, century, bc, sparta, had, subdued, many, of, the, main, greek, states, and, even, invaded, the, persian, provinces, in, anatolia, modern, day, turkey, a, period, known, as, the, spartan, hegemony, during, the, corinthian, war, sparta, faced, a, coalition, of, the, leading, greek, states, thebes, athens, corinth, and, argos, the, alliance, was, initially, backed, by, persia, which, feared, further, spartan, expansion, into, asia, sparta, achieved, a, series, of, land, victories, but, many, of, her, ships, were, destroyed, at, the, battle, of, cnidus, by, a, greek, phoenician, mercenary, fleet, that, persia, had, provided, to, athens, the, event, severely, damaged, sparta, s, naval, power, but, did, not, end, its, aspirations, of, invading, further, into, persia, until, conon, the, athenian, ravaged, the, spartan, coastline, and, provoked, the, old, spartan, fear, of, a, helot, revolt, after, a, few, more, years, of, fighting, in, 387, bc, the, peace, of, antalcidas, was, established, according, to, which, all, greek, cities, of, ionia, would, return, to, persian, control, and, persia, s, asian, border, would, be, free, of, the, spartan, threat, the, effects, of, the, war, were, to, reaffirm, persia, s, ability, to, interfere, successfully, in, greek, politics, and, to, affirm, sparta, s, weakened, hegemonic, position, in, the, greek, political, system, sparta, entered, its, long, term, decline, after, a, severe, military, defeat, to, epaminondas, of, thebes, at, the, battle, of, leuctra, this, was, the, first, time, that, a, full, strength, spartan, army, lost, a, land, battle, as, spartan, citizenship, was, inherited, by, blood, sparta, increasingly, faced, a, helot, population, that, vastly, outnumbered, its, citizens, the, alarming, decline, of, spartan, citizens, was, commented, on, by, aristotle, sparta, never, fully, recovered, from, its, losses, at, leuctra, in, 371, bc, and, the, subsequent, helot, revolts, in, 338, philip, ii, invaded, and, devastated, much, of, laconia, turning, the, spartans, out, though, he, did, not, seize, sparta, itself, even, during, its, decline, sparta, never, forgot, its, claim, to, be, the, defender, of, hellenism, and, its, laconic, wit, an, anecdote, has, it, that, when, philip, ii, sent, a, message, to, sparta, saying, if, i, invade, laconia, i, shall, turn, you, out, the, spartans, responded, with, the, single, terse, reply, if, when, philip, created, the, league, of, corinth, on, the, pretext, of, unifying, greece, against, persia, the, spartans, chose, not, to, join, since, they, had, no, interest, in, joining, a, pan, greek, expedition, unless, it, were, under, spartan, leadership, thus, upon, defeating, the, persians, at, the, battle, of, the, granicus, alexander, the, great, sent, to, athens, 300, suits, of, persian, armour, with, the, following, inscription, alexander, son, of, philip, and, all, the, greeks, except, the, spartans, give, these, offerings, taken, from, the, foreigners, who, live, in, asia, sparta, continued, to, be, one, of, the, peloponesian, powers, until, its, eventual, loss, of, independence, in, 192, bc, during, alexander, s, campaigns, in, the, east, the, spartan, king, agis, iii, sent, a, force, to, crete, in, 333, bc, to, secure, the, island, for, the, persian, interest, agis, next, took, command, of, allied, greek, forces, against, macedon, gaining, early, successes, before, laying, siege, to, megalopolis, in, 331, bc, a, large, macedonian, army, under, general, antipater, marched, to, its, relief, and, defeated, the, spartan, led, force, in, a, pitched, battle, more, than, 5, 300, of, the, spartans, and, their, allies, were, killed, in, battle, and, 3, 500, of, antipater, s, troops, agis, now, wounded, and, unable, to, stand, ordered, his, men, to, leave, him, behind, to, face, the, advancing, macedonian, army, so, that, he, could, buy, them, time, to, retreat, on, his, knees, the, spartan, king, slew, several, enemy, soldiers, before, being, finally, killed, by, a, javelin, alexander, was, merciful, and, he, only, forced, the, spartans, to, join, the, league, of, corinth, which, they, had, previously, refused, during, the, punic, wars, sparta, was, an, ally, of, the, roman, republic, spartan, political, independence, was, put, to, an, end, when, it, was, eventually, forced, into, the, achaean, league, after, its, defeat, in, the, decisive, laconian, war, by, a, coalition, of, other, greek, city, states, and, rome, and, the, resultant, overthrow, of, its, final, king, nabis, in, 192, bc, sparta, played, no, active, part, in, the, achaean, war, in, 146, bc, when, the, achaean, league, was, defeated, by, the, roman, general, lucius, mummius, subsequently, sparta, became, a, free, city, under, roman, rule, some, of, the, institutions, of, lycurgus, were, restored, and, the, city, became, a, tourist, attraction, for, the, roman, elite, who, came, to, observe, exotic, spartan, customs, in, 214, ad, roman, emperor, caracalla, in, his, preparation, for, his, campaign, against, parthia, recruited, a, 500, man, spartan, cohort, lokhos, herodian, described, this, unit, as, a, phalanx, implying, it, fought, like, the, old, spartans, as, hoplites, or, even, as, a, macedonian, phalanx, despite, this, a, gravestone, of, a, fallen, legionary, named, marcus, aurelius, alexys, shows, him, lightly, armed, with, a, pilos, like, cap, and, a, wooden, club, the, unit, was, presumably, discharged, in, 217, after, caracalla, was, assassinated, an, exchange, of, letters, in, the, deutero, canonical, first, book, of, maccabees, expresses, a, jewish, claim, to, kinship, with, the, spartans, areus, king, of, the, lacedemonians, to, onias, the, high, priest, greeting, it, is, found, in, writing, that, the, lacedemonians, and, jews, are, brethren, and, that, they, are, of, the, stock, of, abraham, now, therefore, since, this, is, come, to, our, knowledge, ye, shall, do, well, to, write, unto, us, of, your, prosperity, we, do, write, back, again, to, you, that, your, cattle, and, goods, are, ours, and, ours, are, yours, the, letters, are, reproduced, in, a, variant, form, by, josephus, jewish, historian, uriel, rappaport, notes, that, the, relationship, between, the, jews, and, the, spartans, expressed, in, this, correspondence, has, intrigued, many, scholars, and, various, explanations, have, been, suggested, for, the, problems, raised, including, the, historicity, of, the, jewish, leader, and, high, priest, jonathan, s, letter, to, the, spartans, the, authenticity, of, the, letter, of, arius, to, onias, cited, in, jonathan, s, letter, and, the, supposed, brotherhood, of, the, jews, and, the, spartans, rappaport, is, clear, that, the, authenticity, of, letter, of, arius, is, based, on, even, less, firm, foundations, than, the, letter, of, jonathan, spartans, long, spurned, the, idea, of, building, a, defensive, wall, around, their, city, believing, they, made, the, city, s, men, soft, in, terms, of, their, warrior, abilities, a, wall, was, finally, erected, after, 184, bce, after, the, peak, of, the, city, state, s, power, had, come, and, gone, in, 396, ad, sparta, was, sacked, by, visigoths, under, alaric, i, according, to, byzantine, sources, some, parts, of, the, laconian, region, remained, pagan, until, well, into, the, 10th, century, the, tsakonian, language, still, spoken, in, tsakonia, is, the, only, surviving, descendant, of, the, ancient, doric, language, in, the, middle, ages, the, political, and, cultural, center, of, laconia, shifted, to, the, nearby, settlement, of, mystras, and, sparta, fell, further, in, even, local, importance, modern, sparta, was, re, founded, in, 1834, by, a, decree, of, king, otto, of, greece, sparta, was, an, oligarchy, the, state, was, ruled, by, two, hereditary, kings, of, the, agiad, and, eurypontid, families, both, supposedly, descendants, of, heracles, and, equal, in, authority, so, that, one, could, not, act, against, the, power, and, political, enactments, of, his, colleague, the, duties, of, the, kings, were, primarily, religious, judicial, and, military, as, chief, priests, of, the, state, they, maintained, communication, with, the, delphian, sanctuary, whose, pronouncements, exercised, great, authority, in, spartan, politics, in, the, time, of, herodotus, c, 450, bc, their, judicial, functions, had, been, restricted, to, cases, dealing, with, heiresses, epikleroi, adoptions, and, the, public, roads, the, meaning, of, the, last, term, is, unclear, in, herodotus, text, and, has, been, interpreted, in, a, number, of, ways, aristotle, describes, the, kingship, at, sparta, as, a, kind, of, unlimited, and, perpetual, generalship, pol, iii, 1285a, while, isocrates, refers, to, the, spartans, as, subject, to, an, oligarchy, at, home, to, a, kingship, on, campaign, iii, 24, civil, and, criminal, cases, were, decided, by, a, group, of, officials, known, as, the, ephors, as, well, as, a, council, of, elders, known, as, the, gerousia, the, gerousia, consisted, of, 28, elders, over, the, age, of, 60, elected, for, life, and, usually, part, of, the, royal, households, and, the, two, kings, high, state, decisions, were, discussed, by, this, council, who, could, then, propose, policies, to, the, damos, the, collective, body, of, spartan, citizenry, who, would, select, one, of, the, alternatives, by, vote, royal, prerogatives, were, curtailed, over, time, from, the, period, of, the, persian, wars, the, king, lost, the, right, to, declare, war, and, was, accompanied, in, the, field, by, two, ephors, he, was, supplanted, by, the, ephors, also, in, the, control, of, foreign, policy, over, time, the, kings, became, mere, figureheads, except, in, their, capacity, as, generals, political, power, was, transferred, to, the, ephors, and, gerousia, an, assembly, of, citizens, called, the, ekklesia, was, responsible, for, electing, men, to, the, gerousia, for, life, the, spartan, education, process, known, as, the, agoge, was, essential, for, full, citizenship, however, usually, the, only, boys, eligible, for, the, agoge, were, spartiates, those, who, could, trace, their, ancestry, to, the, original, inhabitants, of, the, city, there, were, two, exceptions, trophimoi, or, foster, sons, were, foreign, students, invited, to, study, the, athenian, general, xenophon, for, example, sent, his, two, sons, to, sparta, as, trophimoi, also, the, son, of, a, helot, could, be, enrolled, as, a, syntrophos, if, a, spartiate, formally, adopted, him, and, paid, his, way, if, he, did, exceptionally, well, in, training, he, might, be, sponsored, to, become, a, spartiate, spartans, who, could, not, afford, to, pay, the, expenses, of, the, agoge, could, lose, their, citizenship, these, laws, meant, that, sparta, could, not, readily, replace, citizens, lost, in, battle, or, otherwise, which, eventually, proved, near, fatal, as, citizens, became, greatly, outnumbered, by, non, citizens, and, even, more, dangerously, by, helots, the, other, classes, were, the, perioikoi, free, inhabitants, who, were, non, citizens, and, the, helots, state, owned, serfs, descendants, of, non, spartan, citizens, were, forbidden, the, agoge, the, spartans, were, a, minority, of, the, lakonian, population, the, largest, class, of, inhabitants, were, the, helots, in, classical, greek, he, l, tes, the, helots, were, originally, free, greeks, from, the, areas, of, messenia, and, lakonia, whom, the, spartans, had, defeated, in, battle, and, subsequently, enslaved, in, contrast, to, populations, conquered, by, other, greek, cities, e, g, the, athenian, treatment, of, melos, the, male, population, was, not, exterminated, and, the, women, and, children, turned, into, chattel, slaves, instead, the, helots, were, given, a, subordinate, position, in, society, more, comparable, to, serfs, in, medieval, europe, than, chattel, slaves, in, the, rest, of, greece, the, spartan, helots, were, not, only, agricultural, workers, but, were, also, household, servants, both, male, and, female, would, be, assigned, domestic, duties, such, as, wool, working, however, the, helots, were, not, the, private, property, of, individual, spartan, citizens, regardless, of, their, household, duties, and, were, instead, owned, by, the, state, through, the, kleros, system, helots, did, not, have, voting, or, political, rights, the, spartan, poet, tyrtaios, refers, to, helots, being, allowed, to, marry, and, retaining, 50, of, the, fruits, of, their, labor, they, also, seem, to, have, been, allowed, to, practice, religious, rites, and, according, to, thucydides, own, a, limited, amount, of, personal, property, initially, helots, couldn, t, be, freed, but, during, the, middle, hellenistic, period, some, 6, 000, helots, accumulated, enough, wealth, to, buy, their, freedom, for, example, in, 227, bc, in, other, greek, city, states, free, citizens, were, part, time, soldiers, who, when, not, at, war, carried, on, other, trades, since, spartan, men, were, full, time, soldiers, they, were, not, available, to, carry, out, manual, labour, the, helots, were, used, as, unskilled, serfs, tilling, spartan, land, helot, women, were, often, used, as, wet, nurses, helots, also, travelled, with, the, spartan, army, as, non, combatant, serfs, at, the, last, stand, of, the, battle, of, thermopylae, the, greek, dead, included, not, just, the, legendary, three, hundred, spartan, soldiers, but, also, several, hundred, thespian, and, theban, troops, and, a, number, of, helots, there, was, at, least, one, helot, revolt, c, 465, 460, bc, that, led, to, prolonged, conflict, by, the, tenth, year, of, this, war, the, spartans, and, messenians, had, reached, an, agreement, in, which, messenian, rebels, were, allowed, to, leave, the, peloponnese, they, were, given, safe, passage, under, the, terms, that, they, would, be, re, enslaved, if, they, tried, to, return, this, agreement, ended, the, most, serious, incursion, into, spartan, territory, since, their, expansion, in, the, seventh, and, eighth, centuries, bc, thucydides, remarked, that, spartan, policy, is, always, mainly, governed, by, the, necessity, of, taking, precautions, against, the, helots, on, the, other, hand, the, spartans, trusted, their, helots, enough, in, 479, bc, to, take, a, force, of, 35, 000, with, them, to, plataea, something, they, could, not, have, risked, if, they, feared, the, helots, would, attack, them, or, run, away, slave, revolts, occurred, elsewhere, in, the, greek, world, and, in, 413, bc, 20, 000, athenian, slaves, ran, away, to, join, the, spartan, forces, occupying, attica, what, made, sparta, s, relations, with, her, slave, population, unique, was, that, the, helots, precisely, because, they, enjoyed, privileges, such, as, family, and, property, retained, their, identity, as, a, conquered, people, the, messenians, and, also, had, effective, kinship, groups, that, could, be, used, to, organize, rebellion, as, the, spartiate, population, declined, and, the, helot, population, continued, to, grow, the, imbalance, of, power, caused, increasing, tension, according, to, myron, of, priene, of, the, middle, 3rd, century, bc, they, assign, to, the, helots, every, shameful, task, leading, to, disgrace, for, they, ordained, that, each, one, of, them, must, wear, a, dogskin, cap, kun, and, wrap, himself, in, skins, diphth, ra, and, receive, a, stipulated, number, of, beatings, every, year, regardless, of, any, wrongdoing, so, that, they, would, never, forget, they, were, slaves, moreover, if, any, exceeded, the, vigour, proper, to, a, slave, s, condition, they, made, death, the, penalty, and, they, allotted, a, punishment, to, those, controlling, them, if, they, failed, to, rebuke, those, who, were, growing, fat, plutarch, also, states, that, spartans, treated, the, helots, harshly, and, cruelly, they, compelled, them, to, drink, pure, wine, which, was, considered, dangerous, wine, usually, being, cut, with, water, and, to, lead, them, in, that, condition, into, their, public, halls, that, the, children, might, see, what, a, sight, a, drunken, man, is, they, made, them, to, dance, low, dances, and, sing, ridiculous, songs, during, syssitia, obligatory, banquets, each, year, when, the, ephors, took, office, they, ritually, declared, war, on, the, helots, allowing, spartans, to, kill, them, without, risk, of, ritual, pollution, this, fight, seems, to, have, been, carried, out, by, kryptai, sing, krypt, s, graduates, of, the, agoge, who, took, part, in, the, mysterious, institution, known, as, the, krypteia, thucydides, states, the, helots, were, invited, by, a, proclamation, to, pick, out, those, of, their, number, who, claimed, to, have, most, distinguished, themselves, against, the, enemy, in, order, that, they, might, receive, their, freedom, the, object, being, to, test, them, as, it, was, thought, that, the, first, to, claim, their, freedom, would, be, the, most, high, spirited, and, the, most, apt, to, rebel, as, many, as, two, thousand, were, selected, accordingly, who, crowned, themselves, and, went, round, the, temples, rejoicing, in, their, new, freedom, the, spartans, however, soon, afterwards, did, away, with, them, and, no, one, ever, knew, how, each, of, them, perished, the, perioikoi, came, from, similar, origins, as, the, helots, but, occupied, a, significantly, different, position, in, spartan, society, although, they, did, not, enjoy, full, citizen, rights, they, were, free, and, not, subjected, to, the, same, restrictions, as, the, helots, the, exact, nature, of, their, subjection, to, the, spartans, is, not, clear, but, they, seem, to, have, served, partly, as, a, kind, of, military, reserve, partly, as, skilled, craftsmen, and, partly, as, agents, of, foreign, trade, perioikoic, hoplites, served, increasingly, with, the, spartan, army, explicitly, at, the, battle, of, plataea, and, although, they, may, also, have, fulfilled, functions, such, as, the, manufacture, and, repair, of, armour, and, weapons, they, were, increasingly, integrated, into, the, combat, units, of, the, spartan, army, as, the, spartiate, population, declined, full, citizen, spartiates, were, barred, by, law, from, trade, or, manufacture, which, consequently, rested, in, the, hands, of, the, perioikoi, this, lucrative, monopoly, in, a, fertile, territory, with, a, good, harbors, ensured, the, loyalty, of, the, perioikoi, despite, the, prohibition, on, menial, labor, or, trade, there, is, evidence, of, spartan, sculptors, and, spartans, were, certainly, poets, magistrates, ambassadors, and, governors, as, well, as, soldiers, allegedly, spartans, were, prohibited, from, possessing, gold, and, silver, coins, and, according, to, legend, spartan, currency, consisted, of, iron, bars, to, discourage, hoarding, it, was, not, until, the, 260s, or, 250s, bc, that, sparta, began, to, mint, its, own, coins, though, the, conspicuous, display, of, wealth, appears, to, have, been, discouraged, this, did, not, preclude, the, production, of, very, fine, decorated, bronze, ivory, and, wooden, works, of, art, as, well, as, exquisite, jewellery, attested, in, archaeology, allegedly, as, part, of, the, lycurgan, reforms, in, the, mid, 8th, century, bc, a, massive, land, reform, had, divided, property, into, 9, 000, equal, portions, each, citizen, received, one, estate, a, kleros, which, was, expected, to, provide, his, living, the, land, was, worked, by, helots, who, retained, half, the, yield, from, the, other, half, the, spartiate, was, expected, to, pay, his, mess, syssitia, fees, and, the, agoge, fees, for, his, children, however, nothing, is, known, of, matters, of, wealth, such, as, how, land, was, bought, sold, and, inherited, or, whether, daughters, received, dowries, however, from, early, on, there, were, marked, differences, of, wealth, within, the, state, and, these, became, more, serious, after, the, law, of, epitadeus, some, time, after, the, peloponnesian, war, which, removed, the, legal, prohibition, on, the, gift, or, bequest, of, land, by, the, mid, 5th, century, land, had, become, concentrated, in, the, hands, of, a, tiny, elite, and, the, notion, that, all, spartan, citizens, were, equals, had, become, an, empty, pretence, by, aristotle, s, day, 384, 322, bc, citizenship, had, been, reduced, from, 9, 000, to, less, than, 1, 000, then, further, decreased, to, 700, at, the, accession, of, agis, iv, in, 244, bc, attempts, were, made, to, remedy, this, by, imposing, legal, penalties, upon, bachelors, but, this, could, not, reverse, the, trend, sparta, was, above, all, a, militarist, state, and, emphasis, on, military, fitness, began, virtually, at, birth, according, to, plutarch, after, birth, a, mother, would, bathe, her, child, in, wine, to, see, whether, the, child, was, strong, if, the, child, survived, it, was, brought, before, the, gerousia, by, the, child, s, father, the, gerousia, then, decided, whether, it, was, to, be, reared, or, not, it, is, commonly, stated, that, if, they, considered, it, puny, and, deformed, the, baby, was, thrown, into, a, chasm, on, mount, taygetos, known, euphemistically, as, the, apothetae, gr, deposits, this, was, in, effect, a, primitive, form, of, eugenics, plutarch, is, the, sole, historical, source, for, the, spartan, practice, of, systemic, infanticide, motivated, by, eugenics, sparta, is, often, viewed, as, being, unique, in, this, regard, however, anthropologist, laila, williamson, notes, infanticide, has, been, practiced, on, every, continent, and, by, people, on, every, level, of, cultural, complexity, from, hunter, gatherers, to, high, civilizations, rather, than, being, an, exception, then, it, has, been, the, rule, there, is, controversy, about, the, matter, in, sparta, since, excavations, in, the, chasm, only, uncovered, adult, remains, likely, belonging, to, criminals, and, greek, sources, contemporary, to, sparta, does, not, mention, systemic, infanticide, motivated, solely, by, eugenics, spartan, burial, customs, changed, over, time, the, archaic, spartan, poet, tyrtaeus, spoke, of, the, spartan, war, dead, as, follows, never, do, his, name, and, good, fame, perish, but, even, though, he, is, beneath, the, earth, he, is, immortal, young, and, old, alike, mourn, him, all, the, city, is, distressed, by, the, painful, loss, and, his, tomb, and, children, are, pointed, out, among, the, people, and, his, children, s, children, and, his, line, after, them, when, spartans, died, marked, headstones, would, only, be, granted, to, soldiers, who, died, in, combat, during, a, victorious, campaign, or, women, who, died, either, in, service, of, a, divine, office, or, in, childbirth, these, headstones, likely, acted, as, memorials, rather, than, as, grave, markers, evidence, of, spartan, burials, is, provided, by, the, tomb, of, the, lacedaimonians, in, athens, excavations, at, the, cemetery, of, classical, sparta, uncovered, ritually, pierced, kantharoid, like, ceramic, vessels, the, ritual, slaughter, of, horses, and, specific, burial, enclosures, alongside, individual, plots, some, of, the, graves, were, reused, over, time, in, the, hellenistic, period, grander, two, storey, monumental, tombs, are, found, at, sparta, ten, of, these, have, been, found, for, this, period, when, male, spartans, began, military, training, at, age, seven, they, would, enter, the, agoge, system, the, agoge, was, designed, to, encourage, discipline, and, physical, toughness, and, to, emphasize, the, importance, of, the, spartan, state, boys, lived, in, communal, messes, and, according, to, xenophon, whose, sons, attended, the, agoge, the, boys, were, fed, just, the, right, amount, for, them, never, to, become, sluggish, through, being, too, full, while, also, giving, them, a, taste, of, what, it, is, not, to, have, enough, in, addition, they, were, trained, to, survive, in, times, of, privation, even, if, it, meant, stealing, besides, physical, and, weapons, training, boys, studied, reading, writing, music, and, dancing, special, punishments, were, imposed, if, boys, failed, to, answer, questions, sufficiently, laconically, i, e, briefly, and, wittily, spartan, boys, were, expected, to, take, an, older, male, mentor, usually, an, unmarried, young, man, according, to, some, sources, the, older, man, was, expected, to, function, as, a, kind, of, substitute, father, and, role, model, to, his, junior, partner, however, others, believe, it, was, reasonably, certain, that, they, had, sexual, relations, the, exact, nature, of, spartan, pederasty, is, not, entirely, clear, xenophon, an, admirer, of, the, spartan, educational, system, whose, sons, attended, the, agoge, explicitly, denies, the, sexual, nature, of, the, relationship, some, spartan, youth, apparently, became, members, of, an, irregular, unit, known, as, the, krypteia, the, immediate, objective, of, this, unit, was, to, seek, out, and, kill, vulnerable, helot, laconians, as, part, of, the, larger, program, of, terrorising, and, intimidating, the, helot, population, less, information, is, available, about, the, education, of, spartan, girls, but, they, seem, to, have, gone, through, a, fairly, extensive, formal, educational, cycle, broadly, similar, to, that, of, the, boys, but, with, less, emphasis, on, military, training, spartan, girls, received, an, education, known, as, mousik, this, included, music, dancing, singing, and, poetry, choral, dancing, was, taught, so, spartan, girls, could, participate, in, ritual, activities, including, the, cults, of, helen, and, artemis, in, this, respect, classical, sparta, was, unique, in, ancient, greece, in, no, other, city, state, did, women, receive, any, kind, of, formal, education, at, age, 20, the, spartan, citizen, began, his, membership, in, one, of, the, syssitia, dining, messes, or, clubs, composed, of, about, fifteen, members, each, of, which, every, citizen, was, required, to, be, a, member, here, each, group, learned, how, to, bond, and, rely, on, one, another, the, spartans, were, not, eligible, for, election, for, public, office, until, the, age, of, 30, only, native, spartans, were, considered, full, citizens, and, were, obliged, to, undergo, the, training, as, prescribed, by, law, as, well, as, participate, in, and, contribute, financially, to, one, of, the, syssitia, sparta, is, thought, to, be, the, first, city, to, practice, athletic, nudity, and, some, scholars, claim, that, it, was, also, the, first, to, formalize, pederasty, according, to, these, sources, the, spartans, believed, that, the, love, of, an, older, accomplished, aristocrat, for, an, adolescent, was, essential, to, his, formation, as, a, free, citizen, the, agoge, the, education, of, the, ruling, class, was, they, claim, founded, on, pederastic, relationships, required, of, each, citizen, with, the, lover, responsible, for, the, boy, s, training, however, other, scholars, question, this, interpretation, xenophon, explicitly, denies, it, but, not, plutarch, spartan, men, remained, in, the, active, reserve, until, age, 60, men, were, encouraged, to, marry, at, age, 20, but, could, not, live, with, their, families, until, they, left, their, active, military, service, at, age, 30, they, called, themselves, homoioi, equals, pointing, to, their, common, lifestyle, and, the, discipline, of, the, phalanx, which, demanded, that, no, soldier, be, superior, to, his, comrades, insofar, as, hoplite, warfare, could, be, perfected, the, spartans, did, so, thucydides, reports, that, when, a, spartan, man, went, to, war, his, wife, or, another, woman, of, some, significance, would, customarily, present, him, with, his, aspis, shield, and, say, with, this, or, upon, this, i, t, n, i, p, t, s, meaning, that, true, spartans, could, only, return, to, sparta, either, victorious, with, their, shield, in, hand, or, dead, carried, upon, it, this, is, almost, certainly, propaganda, spartans, buried, their, battle, dead, on, or, near, the, battle, field, corpses, were, not, brought, back, on, their, shield, nevertheless, it, is, fair, to, say, that, it, was, less, of, a, disgrace, for, a, soldier, to, lose, his, helmet, breastplate, or, greaves, than, his, shield, since, the, former, were, designed, to, protect, one, man, whereas, the, shield, also, protected, the, man, on, his, left, thus, the, shield, was, symbolic, of, the, individual, soldier, s, subordination, to, his, unit, his, integral, part, in, its, success, and, his, solemn, responsibility, to, his, comrades, in, arms, messmates, and, friends, often, close, blood, relations, according, to, aristotle, the, spartan, military, culture, was, actually, short, sighted, and, ineffective, he, observed, it, is, the, standards, of, civilized, men, not, of, beasts, that, must, be, kept, in, mind, for, it, is, good, men, not, beasts, who, are, capable, of, real, courage, those, like, the, spartans, who, concentrate, on, the, one, and, ignore, the, other, in, their, education, turn, men, into, machines, and, in, devoting, themselves, to, one, single, aspect, of, city, s, life, end, up, making, them, inferior, even, in, that, one, of, the, most, persistent, myths, about, sparta, that, has, no, basis, in, fact, is, the, notion, that, spartan, mothers, were, without, feelings, toward, their, off, spring, and, helped, enforce, a, militaristic, lifestyle, on, their, sons, and, husbands, the, myth, can, be, traced, back, to, plutarch, who, includes, no, less, than, 17, sayings, of, spartan, women, all, of, which, paraphrase, or, elaborate, on, the, theme, that, spartan, mothers, rejected, their, own, offspring, if, they, showed, any, kind, of, cowardice, in, some, of, these, sayings, mothers, revile, their, sons, in, insulting, language, merely, for, surviving, a, battle, these, sayings, purporting, to, be, from, spartan, women, were, far, more, likely, to, be, of, athenian, origin, and, designed, to, portray, spartan, women, as, unnatural, and, so, undeserving, of, pity, sparta, s, agriculture, consisted, mainly, of, barley, wine, cheese, grain, and, figs, these, items, were, grown, locally, on, each, spartan, citizen, s, kleros, and, were, tended, to, by, helots, spartan, citizens, were, required, to, donate, a, certain, amount, of, what, they, yielded, from, their, kleros, to, their, syssitia, or, mess, these, donations, to, the, syssitia, were, a, requirement, for, every, spartan, citizen, all, the, donated, food, was, then, redistributed, to, feed, the, spartan, population, of, that, syssitia, the, helots, who, tended, to, the, lands, were, fed, using, a, portion, of, what, they, harvested, plutarch, reports, the, peculiar, customs, associated, with, the, spartan, wedding, night, the, custom, was, to, capture, women, for, marriage, the, so, called, bridesmaid, took, charge, of, the, captured, girl, she, first, shaved, her, head, to, the, scalp, then, dressed, her, in, a, man, s, cloak, and, sandals, and, laid, her, down, alone, on, a, mattress, in, the, dark, the, bridegroom, who, was, not, drunk, and, thus, not, impotent, but, was, sober, as, always, first, had, dinner, in, the, messes, then, would, slip, in, undo, her, belt, lift, her, and, carry, her, to, the, bed, the, husband, continued, to, visit, his, wife, in, secret, for, some, time, after, the, marriage, these, customs, unique, to, the, spartans, have, been, interpreted, in, various, ways, one, of, them, decidedly, supports, the, need, to, disguise, the, bride, as, a, man, in, order, to, help, the, bridegroom, consummate, the, marriage, so, unaccustomed, were, men, to, women, s, looks, at, the, time, of, their, first, intercourse, the, abduction, may, have, served, to, ward, off, the, evil, eye, and, the, cutting, of, the, wife, s, hair, was, perhaps, part, of, a, rite, of, passage, that, signaled, her, entrance, into, a, new, life, spartan, women, of, the, citizenry, class, enjoyed, a, status, power, and, respect, that, was, unknown, in, the, rest, of, the, classical, world, the, higher, status, of, females, in, spartan, society, started, at, birth, unlike, athens, spartan, girls, were, fed, the, same, food, as, their, brothers, nor, were, they, confined, to, their, father, s, house, and, prevented, from, exercising, or, getting, fresh, air, as, in, athens, but, exercised, and, even, competed, in, sports, most, important, rather, than, being, married, off, at, the, age, of, 12, or, 13, spartan, law, forbade, the, marriage, of, a, girl, until, she, was, in, her, late, teens, or, early, 20s, the, reasons, for, delaying, marriage, were, to, ensure, the, birth, of, healthy, children, but, the, effect, was, to, spare, spartan, women, the, hazards, and, lasting, health, damage, associated, with, pregnancy, among, adolescents, spartan, women, better, fed, from, childhood, and, fit, from, exercise, stood, a, far, better, chance, of, reaching, old, age, than, their, sisters, in, other, greek, cities, where, the, median, age, for, death, was, 34, 6, years, or, roughly, 10, years, below, that, of, men, unlike, athenian, women, who, wore, heavy, concealing, clothes, and, were, rarely, seen, outside, the, house, spartan, women, wore, dresses, peplos, slit, up, the, side, to, allow, freer, movement, and, moved, freely, about, the, city, either, walking, or, driving, chariots, girls, as, well, as, boys, exercised, possibly, in, the, nude, and, young, women, as, well, as, young, men, may, have, participated, in, the, gymnopaedia, festival, of, nude, youths, another, practice, that, was, mentioned, by, many, visitors, to, sparta, was, the, practice, of, wife, sharing, in, accordance, with, the, spartan, belief, that, breeding, should, be, between, the, most, physically, fit, parents, many, older, men, allowed, younger, more, fit, men, to, impregnate, their, wives, other, unmarried, or, childless, men, might, even, request, another, man, s, wife, to, bear, his, children, if, she, had, previously, been, a, strong, child, bearer, for, this, reason, many, considered, spartan, women, polygamous, or, polyandrous, this, practice, was, encouraged, in, order, that, women, bear, as, many, strong, bodied, children, as, they, could, the, spartan, population, was, hard, to, maintain, due, to, the, constant, absence, and, loss, of, the, men, in, battle, and, the, intense, physical, inspection, of, newborns, spartan, women, were, also, literate, and, numerate, a, rarity, in, the, ancient, world, furthermore, as, a, result, of, their, education, and, the, fact, that, they, moved, freely, in, society, engaging, with, their, fellow, male, citizens, they, were, notorious, for, speaking, their, minds, even, in, public, plato, in, the, middle, of, the, fourth, century, described, women, s, curriculum, in, sparta, as, consisting, of, gymnastics, and, mousike, music, and, arts, plato, praised, spartan, women, s, ability, when, it, came, to, philosophical, discussion, most, importantly, spartan, women, had, economic, power, because, they, controlled, their, own, properties, and, those, of, their, husbands, it, is, estimated, that, in, later, classical, sparta, when, the, male, population, was, in, serious, decline, women, were, the, sole, owners, of, at, least, 35, of, all, land, and, property, in, sparta, the, laws, regarding, a, divorce, were, the, same, for, both, men, and, women, unlike, women, in, athens, if, a, spartan, woman, became, the, heiress, of, her, father, because, she, had, no, living, brothers, to, inherit, an, epikleros, the, woman, was, not, required, to, divorce, her, current, spouse, in, order, to, marry, her, nearest, paternal, relative, many, women, played, a, significant, role, in, the, history, of, sparta, queen, gorgo, heiress, to, the, throne, and, the, wife, of, leonidas, i, was, an, influential, and, well, documented, figure, herodotus, records, that, as, a, small, girl, she, advised, her, father, cleomenes, to, resist, a, bribe, she, was, later, said, to, be, responsible, for, decoding, a, warning, that, the, persian, forces, were, about, to, invade, greece, after, spartan, generals, could, not, decode, a, wooden, tablet, covered, in, wax, she, ordered, them, to, clear, the, wax, revealing, the, warning, plutarch, s, moralia, contains, a, collection, of, sayings, of, spartan, women, including, a, laconic, quip, attributed, to, gorgo, when, asked, by, a, woman, from, attica, why, spartan, women, were, the, only, women, in, the, world, who, could, rule, men, she, replied, because, we, are, the, only, women, who, are, mothers, of, men, in, 396, cynisca, sister, of, the, eurypontid, king, agesilaos, ii, became, the, first, woman, in, greece, to, win, an, olympic, chariot, race, she, won, again, in, 392, and, dedicated, two, monuments, to, commemorate, her, victory, these, being, an, inscription, in, sparta, and, a, set, of, bronze, equestrian, statues, at, the, olympic, temple, of, zeus, laconophilia, is, love, or, admiration, of, sparta, and, its, culture, or, constitution, sparta, was, subject, of, considerable, admiration, in, its, day, even, in, rival, athens, in, ancient, times, many, of, the, noblest, and, best, of, the, athenians, always, considered, the, spartan, state, nearly, as, an, ideal, theory, realised, in, practice, many, greek, philosophers, especially, platonists, would, often, describe, sparta, as, an, ideal, state, strong, brave, and, free, from, the, corruptions, of, commerce, and, money, the, french, classicist, fran, ois, ollier, in, his, 1933, book, le, mirage, spartiate, the, spartan, mirage, warned, that, a, major, scholarly, problem, is, that, all, surviving, accounts, of, sparta, were, by, non, spartans, who, often, excessively, idealized, their, subject, the, term, spartan, mirage, has, come, to, refer, to, idealized, distortions, and, inventions, regarding, the, character, of, spartan, society, in, the, works, of, non, spartan, writers, beginning, in, greek, and, roman, antiquity, and, continuing, through, the, medieval, and, modern, eras, these, accounts, of, sparta, are, typically, associated, with, the, social, or, political, concerns, of, the, writer, no, accounts, survive, by, the, spartans, themselves, if, such, were, ever, written, with, the, revival, of, classical, learning, in, renaissance, europe, laconophilia, re, appeared, for, example, in, the, writings, of, machiavelli, the, elizabethan, english, constitutionalist, john, aylmer, compared, the, mixed, government, of, tudor, england, to, the, spartan, republic, stating, that, lacedemonia, the, noblest, and, best, city, governed, that, ever, was, he, commended, it, as, a, model, for, england, the, philosopher, jean, jacques, rousseau, contrasted, sparta, favourably, with, athens, in, his, discourse, on, the, arts, and, sciences, arguing, that, its, austere, constitution, was, preferable, to, the, more, sophisticated, athenian, life, sparta, was, also, used, as, a, model, of, austere, purity, by, revolutionary, and, napoleonic, france, a, german, racist, strain, of, laconophilia, was, initiated, by, karl, otfried, m, ller, who, linked, spartan, ideals, to, the, supposed, racial, superiority, of, the, dorians, the, ethnic, sub, group, of, the, greeks, to, which, the, spartans, belonged, in, the, 20th, century, this, developed, into, fascist, admiration, of, spartan, ideals, adolf, hitler, praised, the, spartans, recommending, in, 1928, that, germany, should, imitate, them, by, limiting, the, number, allowed, to, live, he, added, that, the, spartans, were, once, capable, of, such, a, wise, measure, the, subjugation, of, 350, 000, helots, by, 6, 000, spartans, was, only, possible, because, of, the, racial, superiority, of, the, spartans, the, spartans, had, created, the, first, racialist, state, following, the, invasion, of, the, ussr, hitler, viewed, citizens, of, the, ussr, as, like, the, helots, under, the, spartans, they, came, as, conquerors, and, they, took, everything, and, so, should, the, germans, a, nazi, officer, specified, that, the, germans, would, have, to, assume, the, position, of, the, spartiates, while, the, russians, were, the, helots, certain, early, zionists, and, particularly, the, founders, of, kibbutz, movement, in, israel, were, influenced, by, spartan, ideals, particularly, in, education, tabenkin, a, founding, father, of, the, kibbutz, movement, and, the, palmach, strikeforce, prescribed, that, education, for, warfare, should, begin, from, the, nursery, that, children, should, from, kindergarten, be, taken, to, spend, nights, in, the, mountains, and, valleys, in, modern, times, the, adjective, spartan, means, simple, frugal, avoiding, luxury, and, comfort, the, term, laconic, phrase, describes, the, very, terse, and, direct, speech, characteristic, of, the, spartans, sparta, also, features, prominently, in, modern, popular, culture, most, famously, the, battle, of, thermopylae, see, battle, of, thermopylae, in, popular, culture
