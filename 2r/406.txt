advantage, of, the, start, of, the, war, to, extend, france, s, eastern, borders, in, the, war, of, the, reunions, taking, luxembourg, and, strasbourg, in, the, truce, of, ratisbon, however, as, the,

strategically, positioned, forts, along, the, coast, of, the, greek, mainland, since, the, carving, up, of, the, byzantine, empire, after, the, fourth, crusade, however, with, the, rise, of, the, ottomans, during, the, 16th, and, early, 17th, centuries, they, lost, most, of, these, such, as, cyprus, and, euboea, negropont, to, the, turks, between, 1645, and, 1669, the, venetians, and, the, ottomans, fought, a, long, and, costly, war, over, crete, the, last, major, venetian, possession, in, the, aegean, during, this, war, the, venetian, commander, francesco, morosini, came, into, contact, with, the, rebellious, maniots, for, a, joint, campaign, in, the, morea, in, 1659, morosini, landed, in, the, morea, and, together, with, the, maniots, he, took, kalamata, however, he, was, soon, after, forced, to, return, to, crete, and, the, peloponnesian, venture, failed, in, 1683, a, new, war, broke, out, between, the, habsburg, monarchy, and, the, ottomans, with, a, large, ottoman, army, advancing, towards, vienna, in, response, to, this, a, holy, league, was, formed, after, the, ottoman, army, was, defeated, in, the, battle, of, vienna, the, venetians, decided, to, use, the, opportunity, of, the, weakening, of, ottoman, power, and, its, distraction, in, the, danubian, front, so, as, to, reconquer, its, lost, territories, in, the, aegean, and, dalmatia, on, 25, april, 1684, the, most, serene, republic, declared, war, on, the, ottomans, aware, that, she, would, have, to, rely, on, her, own, strength, for, success, venice, prepared, for, the, war, by, securing, financial, and, military, aid, in, men, and, ships, from, hospitaller, malta, the, duchy, of, savoy, the, papal, states, and, the, knights, of, st, stephen, in, addition, the, venetians, enrolled,

of, preveza, and, vonitsa, in, late, september, removed, the, last, ottoman, bastions, these, early, successes, were, important, for, the, venetians, not, only, for, reasons, of, morale, but, because, they, secured, their, communications, with, venice, denied, to, the, ottomans, the, possibility, of, threatening, the, ionian, islands, or, of, ferrying, troops, via, western, greece, to, the, peloponnese, and, because, these, successes, encouraged, the, greeks, to, cooperate, with, them, against, the, ottomans, having, secured, his, rear, during, the, previous, year, morosini, set, his, sights, upon, the, peloponnese, where, the, greeks, especially, the, maniots, had, begun, showing, signs, of, revolt, and, communicated, with, morosini, promising, to, rise, up, in, his, aid, ismail, pasha, the, new, military, commander, of, morea, learned, of, this, and, invaded, the, mani, peninsula, with, 10, 000, men, reinforcing, the, three, forts, that, the, ottomans, already, garrisoned, and, compelled, the, maniots, to, give, up, hostages, to, secure, their, loyalty, as, a, result, the, maniots, remained, uncommitted, when, on, 25, june, 1685, the, venetian, army, 8, 100, men, strong, landed, outside, the, former, venetian, fort, of, koroni, and, laid, siege, to, it, the, castle, surrendered, after, 49, days, on, 11, august, and, the, garrison, was, massacred, after, this,

messenia, were, under, venetian, control, in, october, 1685, the, venetian, army, retreated, to, the, ionian, islands, for, winter, quarters, where, a, plague, broke, out, something, which, would, occur, regularly, in, the, next, years, and, take, a, great, toll, on, the, venetian, army, especially, among, the, german, contingents, in, april, 1686, the, venetians, helped, repulse, an, ottoman, attack, that, threatened, to, overrun, mani, and, were, reinforced, from, the, papal, states, and, tuscany, the, swedish, marshal, otto, wilhelm, k, nigsmarck, was, appointed, head, of, the, land,

effective, bombardment, destroyed, the, fort, s, walls, and, its, inhabitants, were, also, transferred, to, tripoli, the, venetians, then, advanced, towards, argos, and, nafplion, which, was, then, the, most, important, town, in, the, peloponnese, the, venetian, army, ca, 12, 000, strong, landed, around, nafplion, between, 30, july, and, august, 4, k, nigsmarck, immediately, led, an, assault, upon, the, hill, of, palamidi, then, unfortified, which, overlooked, the, town, despite, the, venetians, success, in, capturing, palamidi, the, arrival, of, a, 7, 000, strong, ottoman, army, under, ismail, pasha, at, argos, rendered, their, position, difficult, the, venetians, initial, assault, against, the, relief, army, succeeded, in, taking, argos, and, forcing, the, pasha, to, retreat, to,

autumn, and, winter, of, 1686, morosini, s, forces, were, replenished, by, the, arrival, of, new, german, mercenary, corps, from, hanover, in, spring, 1687, thus, strengthened, he, was, able, to, move, against, the, last, major, ottoman, bastion, in, the, peloponnese, the, town, of, patras, and, the, fort, of, rion, which, along, with, its, twin, at, antirrion, controlled, the, entrance, to,

the, peloponnese, was, under, complete, venetian, control, and, only, the, fort, of, monemvasia, malvasia, in, the, southeast, continued, to, resist, holding, out, until, 1690, after, a, few, years, of, peace, the, ottoman, empire, attacked, the, habsburg, monarchy, again, the, turks, almost, captured, vienna, but, king, john, iii, sobieski, of, poland, led, a, christian, alliance, that,

city, in, 1696, capturing, vienna, had, long, been, a, strategic, aspiration, of, the, ottoman, empire, because, of, its, interlocking, control, over, danubian, black, sea, to, western, europe, southern, europe, and, the, overland, eastern, mediterranean, to, germany, trade, routes, during, the, years, preceding, this, second, siege, the, first, had, taken, place, in, 1529, under, the,

polish, hussars, to, the, already, existing, allied, army, the, command, of, the, forces, of, european, allies, was, entrusted, to, the, polish, king, who, had, under, his, command, 70, 000, 80, 000,

occupy, the, burg, ravelin, and, the, low, wall, in, that, area, on, 8, september, anticipating, a, breach, in, the, city, walls, the, remaining, viennese, prepared, to, fight, in, the, inner, city, the, relief, army, had, to, act, quickly, to, save, the, city, and, so, prevent, another, long, siege, despite, the, binational, composition, of, the, army, and, the, short, space, of, only, six, days, an, effective, leadership, structure, was, established, centred, on, the, polish, king, and, his, hussars, the, holy, league, settled, the, issues, of, payment, by, using, all, available, funds, from, the, government, loans, from, several, wealthy, bankers, and, noblemen, and, large, sums, of, money, from, the, pope, also, the, habsburgs, and, poles, agreed, that, the, polish, government,
