the, macedonian, wars, 214, 148, bc, were, a, series, of, conflicts, fought, by, the, roman, republic, and, its, greek, allies, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, against, several, different, major, greek, kingdoms, they, resulted, in, roman, control, or, influence, over, greece, and, the, rest, of, the, eastern, mediterranean, basin, in, addition, to, their, hegemony, in, the, western, mediterranean, after, the, punic, wars, traditionally, the, macedonian, wars, include, the, four, wars, with, macedonia, in, addition, to, one, war, with, the, seleucid, empire, and, a, final, minor, war, with, the, achaean, league, which, is, often, considered, to, be, the, final, stage, of, the, final, macedonian, war, the, most, significant, war, was, fought, with, the, seleucid, empire, while, the, war, with, macedonia, was, the, second, and, both, of, these, wars, effectively, marked, the, end, of, these, empires, as, major, world, powers, even, though, neither, of, them, led, immediately, to, overt, roman, domination, four, separate, wars, were, fought, against, the, weaker, power, macedonia, due, to, its, geographic, proximity, to, rome, though, the, last, two, of, these, wars, were, against, haphazard, insurrections, rather, than, powerful, armies, roman, influence, gradually, dissolved, macedonian, independence, and, digested, it, into, what, was, becoming, a, leading, empire, the, outcome, of, the, war, with, the, now, deteriorating, seleucid, empire, was, ultimately, fatal, to, it, as, well, though, the, growing, influence, of, parthia, and, pontus, prevented, any, additional, conflicts, between, it, and, rome, from, the, close, of, the, macedonian, wars, until, the, early, roman, empire, the, eastern, mediterranean, remained, an, ever, shifting, network, of, polities, with, varying, levels, of, independence, from, dependence, on, or, outright, military, control, by, rome, according, to, polybius, who, sought, to, trace, how, rome, came, to, dominate, the, greek, east, in, less, than, a, century, rome, s, wars, with, greece, were, set, in, motion, after, several, greek, city, states, sought, roman, protection, against, the, macedonian, kingdom, and, seleucid, empire, in, the, face, of, a, destabilizing, situation, created, by, the, weakening, of, ptolemaic, egypt, in, contrast, to, the, west, the, greek, east, had, been, dominated, by, major, empires, for, centuries, and, roman, influence, and, alliance, seeking, led, to, wars, with, these, empires, that, further, weakened, them, and, therefore, created, an, unstable, power, vacuum, that, only, rome, was, capable, of, pacifying, this, had, some, important, similarities, and, some, important, differences, to, what, had, occurred, in, italy, centuries, earlier, but, was, this, time, on, a, continental, scale, historians, see, the, growing, roman, influence, over, the, east, as, with, the, west, not, as, a, matter, of, intentional, empire, building, but, constant, crisis, management, narrowly, focused, on, accomplishing, short, term, goals, within, a, highly, unstable, unpredictable, and, inter, dependent, network, of, alliances, and, dependencies, with, some, major, exceptions, of, outright, military, rule, such, as, parts, of, mainland, greece, the, eastern, mediterranean, world, remained, an, alliance, of, independent, city, states, and, kingdoms, with, varying, degrees, of, independence, both, de, jure, and, de, facto, until, it, transitioned, into, the, roman, empire, it, wasn, t, until, the, time, of, the, roman, empire, that, the, eastern, mediterranean, along, with, the, entire, roman, world, was, organized, into, provinces, under, explicit, roman, control, during, the, second, punic, war, philip, v, of, macedon, allied, himself, with, hannibal, fearing, possible, reinforcement, of, hannibal, by, macedon, the, senate, dispatched, a, praetor, with, forces, across, the, adriatic, roman, maniples, aided, by, allies, from, the, aetolian, league, and, pergamon, after, 211, bc, did, little, more, than, skirmish, with, macedonian, forces, and, seize, minor, territory, along, the, adriatic, coastline, in, order, to, combat, piracy, rome, s, interest, was, not, in, conquest, but, in, keeping, macedon, busy, while, rome, was, fighting, hannibal, the, war, ended, indecisively, in, 205, bc, with, the, treaty, of, phoenice, while, a, minor, conflict, it, opened, the, way, for, roman, military, intervention, in, macedon, this, conflict, though, fought, between, rome, and, macedon, was, largely, independent, of, the, roman, macedon, wars, that, followed, which, began, with, the, second, macedonian, war, and, were, largely, dependent, on, each, other, in, the, next, century, the, past, century, had, seen, the, greek, world, dominated, by, the, three, primary, successor, kingdoms, of, alexander, the, great, s, empire, ptolemaic, egypt, macedonia, and, the, seleucid, empire, the, imperial, ambitions, of, the, seleucids, after, 230, bc, were, particularly, destabilizing, the, seleucids, set, out, to, conquer, egypt, and, egypt, responded, through, a, major, mobilization, campaign, this, campaign, led, to, military, victory, against, seleucid, incursions, but, in, 205, bc, when, ptolemy, iv, was, succeeded, by, the, five, year, old, ptolemy, v, or, rather, by, his, regents, the, newly, armed, egyptians, turned, against, each, other, the, result, was, a, major, civil, war, between, north, and, south, seeing, that, all, of, egypt, could, now, be, conquered, easily, the, macedonians, and, seleucids, forged, an, alliance, to, conquer, and, divide, egypt, between, themselves, this, represented, the, most, significant, threat, to, the, century, old, political, order, that, had, kept, the, greek, world, in, relative, stability, and, in, particular, represented, a, major, threat, to, the, smaller, greek, kingdoms, which, had, remained, independent, as, macedonia, and, the, seleucid, empire, were, the, problem, and, egypt, the, cause, of, the, problem, the, only, place, to, turn, was, rome, this, represented, a, major, change, as, the, greeks, had, recently, shown, little, more, than, contempt, towards, rome, and, rome, little, more, than, apathy, towards, greece, ambassadors, from, pergamon, and, rhodes, brought, evidence, before, the, roman, senate, that, philip, v, of, macedon, and, antiochus, iii, of, the, seleucid, empire, had, signed, the, non, aggression, pact, although, the, exact, nature, of, this, treaty, is, unclear, and, the, exact, roman, reason, for, getting, involved, despite, decades, of, apathy, towards, greece, the, relevant, passages, on, this, from, our, primary, source, polybius, have, been, lost, the, greek, delegation, was, successful, initially, rome, didn, t, intend, to, fight, a, war, against, macedon, but, rather, to, intervene, on, their, behalf, diplomatically, rome, gave, philip, an, ultimatum, that, he, must, cease, in, his, campaigns, against, rome, s, new, greek, allies, doubting, rome, s, strength, not, an, unfounded, belief, given, rome, s, performance, in, the, first, macedonian, war, philip, ignored, the, request, which, surprised, the, romans, believing, their, honor, and, reputation, on, the, line, rome, escalated, the, conflict, by, sending, an, army, of, romans, and, greek, allies, to, force, the, issue, beginning, the, second, macedonian, war, surprisingly, given, his, recent, successes, against, the, greeks, and, earlier, successes, against, rome, philip, s, army, buckled, under, the, pressure, from, the, roman, greek, army, roman, troops, led, by, then, consul, titus, quinctius, flamininus, reached, the, plain, of, thessaly, by, 198, bc, in, 197, bc, the, romans, decisively, defeated, philip, at, the, battle, of, cynoscephalae, and, he, sued, for, peace, in, the, resulting, treaty, of, tempea, philip, v, was, forbidden, from, interfering, with, affairs, outside, his, borders, and, was, required, to, relinquish, his, recent, greek, conquests, at, the, olympiad, in, 196, bc, rome, proclaimed, the, freedom, of, the, greeks, which, constituted, rome, s, arguably, misguided, new, policy, towards, greece, this, was, that, greece, was, now, stable, and, rome, could, completely, remove, itself, from, greek, affairs, without, risking, more, instability, it, seemed, that, rome, had, no, further, interest, in, the, region, as, they, withdrew, all, military, forces, without, even, attempting, to, consolidate, any, gains, and, subsequently, returned, to, their, prior, apathy, even, when, their, greek, allies, ignored, later, roman, requests, with, egypt, and, macedonia, now, weakened, the, seleucid, empire, became, increasingly, aggressive, and, successful, in, its, attempts, to, conquer, the, entire, greek, world, when, rome, pulled, out, of, greece, at, the, end, of, the, second, macedonian, war, they, and, their, allies, thought, they, had, left, behind, a, stable, peace, however, by, weakening, the, last, remaining, check, on, seleucid, expansion, they, left, behind, the, opposite, now, not, only, did, rome, s, allies, against, philip, seek, a, roman, alliance, against, the, seleucids, but, philip, himself, even, sought, an, alliance, with, rome, the, situation, was, made, worse, by, the, fact, that, hannibal, was, now, a, chief, military, advisor, to, the, seleucid, emperor, and, the, two, were, believed, to, be, planning, for, an, outright, conquest, not, just, of, greece, but, of, rome, also, the, seleucids, were, much, stronger, than, the, macedonians, had, ever, been, given, that, they, controlled, much, of, the, former, persian, empire, and, by, this, point, had, almost, entirely, reassembled, alexander, the, great, s, former, empire, fearing, the, worst, the, romans, began, a, major, mobilization, all, but, pulling, out, of, recently, pacified, spain, and, gaul, they, even, established, a, major, garrison, in, sicily, in, case, the, seleucids, ever, invaded, italy, this, fear, was, shared, by, rome, s, greek, allies, who, had, largely, ignored, rome, in, the, years, after, the, second, macedonian, war, but, now, followed, rome, again, for, the, first, time, since, that, war, a, major, roman, greek, force, was, mobilized, under, the, command, of, the, great, hero, of, the, second, punic, war, scipio, africanus, and, set, out, for, greece, beginning, the, roman, syrian, war, after, initial, fighting, that, revealed, serious, seleucid, weaknesses, the, seleucids, tried, to, turn, the, roman, strength, against, them, at, the, battle, of, thermopylae, as, they, believed, the, 300, spartans, had, done, centuries, earlier, to, the, mighty, persian, empire, like, the, spartans, the, seleucids, lost, the, battle, and, were, forced, to, evacuate, greece, the, romans, pursued, the, seleucids, by, crossing, the, hellespont, which, marked, the, first, time, a, roman, army, had, ever, entered, asia, the, decisive, engagement, was, fought, at, the, battle, of, magnesia, resulting, in, a, complete, roman, victory, the, seleucids, sued, for, peace, and, rome, forced, them, to, give, up, their, recent, greek, conquests, though, they, still, controlled, a, great, deal, of, territory, this, defeat, marked, the, beginning, of, the, end, of, the, seleucid, empire, as, they, were, to, begin, facing, increasingly, aggressive, subjects, in, the, east, the, parthians, and, the, west, the, greeks, as, well, as, judea, in, the, south, their, empire, disintegrated, into, a, rump, over, the, course, of, the, next, century, when, it, was, eclipsed, by, pontus, following, magnesia, rome, pulled, out, of, greece, again, assuming, or, hoping, that, the, lack, of, a, major, greek, power, would, ensure, a, stable, peace, though, it, did, the, opposite, upon, philip, s, death, in, macedon, 179, bc, his, son, perseus, of, macedon, attempted, to, restore, macedon, s, international, influence, and, moved, aggressively, against, his, neighbors, when, perseus, was, implicated, in, an, assassination, plot, against, an, ally, of, rome, the, senate, declared, the, third, macedonian, war, initially, rome, did, not, fare, well, against, the, macedonian, forces, but, in, 168, bc, roman, legions, smashed, the, macedonian, phalanx, at, the, battle, of, pydna, convinced, now, that, the, greeks, and, therefore, the, rest, of, the, world, would, never, have, peace, if, greece, was, left, alone, yet, again, rome, decided, to, establish, its, first, permanent, foothold, in, the, greek, world, the, kingdom, of, macedonia, was, divided, by, the, romans, into, four, client, republics, even, this, proved, insufficient, to, ensure, peace, as, macedonian, agitation, continued, the, fourth, macedonian, war, fought, from, 150, bc, to, 148, bc, was, fought, against, a, macedonian, pretender, to, the, throne, named, andriscus, who, was, again, destabilizing, greece, by, attempting, to, re, establish, the, old, kingdom, the, romans, swiftly, defeated, the, macedonians, at, the, second, battle, of, pydna, in, response, the, achaean, league, in, 146, bc, mobilized, for, a, new, war, against, rome, this, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, achaean, war, and, was, noted, for, its, short, duration, and, its, timing, right, after, the, fall, of, macedonia, until, this, time, rome, had, only, campaigned, in, greece, in, order, to, fight, macedonian, forts, allies, or, clients, rome, s, military, supremacy, was, well, established, having, defeated, macedonia, and, its, vaunted, phalanx, already, on, 3, occasions, and, defeating, superior, numbers, against, the, seleucids, in, asia, the, achaean, leaders, almost, certainly, knew, that, this, declaration, of, war, against, rome, was, hopeless, as, rome, had, triumphed, against, far, stronger, and, larger, opponents, the, roman, legion, having, proved, its, supremacy, over, the, macedonian, phalanx, polybius, blames, the, demagogues, of, the, cities, of, the, league, for, inspiring, the, population, into, a, suicidal, war, nationalist, stirrings, and, the, idea, of, triumphing, against, superior, odds, motivated, the, league, into, this, rash, decision, the, achaean, league, was, swiftly, defeated, and, as, an, object, lesson, rome, utterly, destroyed, the, city, of, corinth, in, 146, bc, the, same, year, that, carthage, was, destroyed, after, nearly, a, century, of, constant, crisis, management, in, greece, which, always, led, back, to, internal, instability, and, war, when, rome, pulled, out, rome, decided, to, divide, macedonia, into, two, new, roman, provinces, achaea, and, epirus
