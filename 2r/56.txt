the, first, evidence, of, human, presence, in, ireland, dates, to, around, 33, 000, years, ago, with, further, findings, dating, the, presence, of, homo, sapiens, to, around, 10, 500, to, 7, 000, bce, the, receding, of, the, ice, after, the, younger, dryas, cold, phase, of, the, quaternary, around, 9700, bce, heralds, the, beginning, of, prehistoric, ireland, which, includes, the, archaeological, periods, known, as, the, mesolithic, the, neolithic, from, about, 4000, bce, and, the, copper, age, beginning, around, 2500, bce, with, the, arrival, of, the, beaker, culture, the, irish, bronze, age, proper, begins, around, 2000, bce, and, ends, with, the, arrival, of, the, iron, age, of, the, celtic, hallstatt, culture, beginning, about, 600, bce, the, subsequent, la, t, ne, culture, brought, new, styles, and, practices, by, 300, bce, greek, and, roman, writers, give, some, information, about, ireland, during, the, classical, period, see, protohistoric, period, by, which, time, the, island, may, be, termed, gaelic, ireland, by, the, late, 4th, century, ce, christianity, had, begun, to, gradually, subsume, or, replace, the, earlier, celtic, polytheism, by, the, end, of, the, 6th, century, it, had, introduced, writing, along, with, a, predominantly, monastic, celtic, christian, church, profoundly, altering, irish, society, scandinavian, seafaring, people, who, took, jobs, pirating, pillaging, and, raiding, lands, later, referred, to, as, vikings, settled, from, the, late, 8th, century, ce, which, resulted, in, extensive, cultural, interchange, as, well, as, innovation, in, military, and, transport, technology, many, of, ireland, s, towns, were, founded, at, this, time, as, scandinavian, trading, posts, and, coinage, made, its, first, appearance, scandinavian, penetration, was, limited, and, concentrated, along, coasts, and, rivers, and, ceased, to, be, a, major, threat, to, gaelic, culture, after, the, battle, of, clontarf, in, 1014, the, norman, invasion, in, 1169, resulted, again, in, a, partial, conquest, of, the, island, and, marked, the, beginning, of, more, than, 800, years, of, english, political, and, military, involvement, in, ireland, initially, successful, norman, gains, were, rolled, back, over, succeeding, centuries, as, a, gaelic, resurgence, reestablished, gaelic, cultural, preeminence, over, most, of, the, country, apart, from, the, walled, towns, and, the, area, around, dublin, known, as, the, pale, reduced, to, the, control, of, small, pockets, the, english, crown, did, not, make, another, attempt, to, conquer, the, island, until, after, the, end, of, the, wars, of, the, roses, 1488, this, released, resources, and, manpower, for, overseas, expansion, beginning, in, the, early, 16th, century, however, the, nature, of, ireland, s, decentralised, political, organisation, into, small, territories, known, as, t, atha, martial, traditions, difficult, terrain, and, climate, and, lack, of, urban, infrastructure, meant, that, attempts, to, assert, crown, authority, were, slow, and, expensive, attempts, to, impose, the, new, protestant, faith, were, also, successfully, resisted, by, both, the, gaelic, and, norman, irish, the, new, policy, fomented, the, rebellion, of, the, hiberno, norman, earl, of, kildare, silken, thomas, in, 1534, keen, to, defend, his, traditional, autonomy, and, catholicism, and, marked, the, beginning, of, the, prolonged, tudor, conquest, of, ireland, lasting, from, 1536, to, 1603, henry, viii, proclaimed, himself, king, of, ireland, in, 1541, to, facilitate, the, project, ireland, became, a, potential, battleground, in, the, wars, between, catholic, counter, reformation, and, protestant, reformation, europe, england, s, attempts, either, to, conquer, or, to, assimilate, both, the, hiberno, norman, lordships, and, the, gaelic, territories, into, the, kingdom, of, ireland, provided, the, impetus, for, ongoing, warfare, notable, examples, being, the, 1st, desmond, rebellion, the, 2nd, desmond, rebellion, and, the, nine, years, war, this, period, was, marked, by, the, crown, policies, of, at, first, surrender, and, regrant, and, later, plantation, involving, the, arrival, of, thousands, of, english, and, scottish, protestant, settlers, and, the, displacement, of, both, the, hiberno, normans, or, old, english, as, they, were, known, by, then, and, the, native, catholic, landholders, with, english, colonies, going, back, to, the, 1550s, ireland, was, arguably, the, first, english, and, then, british, territory, colonised, by, a, group, known, as, the, west, country, men, gaelic, ireland, was, finally, defeated, at, the, battle, of, kinsale, in, 1601, which, marked, the, collapse, of, the, gaelic, system, and, the, beginning, of, ireland, s, history, as, fully, part, of, the, english, and, later, british, empire, during, the, 17th, century, this, division, between, a, protestant, landholding, minority, and, a, dispossessed, catholic, majority, was, intensified, and, conflict, between, them, was, to, become, a, recurrent, theme, in, irish, history, domination, of, ireland, by, the, protestant, ascendancy, was, reinforced, after, two, periods, of, religious, war, the, irish, confederate, wars, in, 1641, 52, and, the, williamite, war, in, 1689, 91, political, power, thereafter, rested, almost, exclusively, in, the, hands, of, a, minority, protestant, ascendancy, while, catholics, and, members, of, dissenting, protestant, denominations, suffered, severe, political, and, economic, privations, under, the, penal, laws, on, 1, january, 1801, in, the, wake, of, the, republican, united, irishmen, rebellion, the, irish, parliament, was, abolished, and, ireland, became, part, of, a, new, united, kingdom, of, great, britain, and, ireland, formed, by, the, acts, of, union, 1800, catholics, were, not, granted, full, rights, until, catholic, emancipation, in, 1829, achieved, by, daniel, o, connell, the, great, famine, struck, ireland, in, 1845, resulting, in, over, a, million, deaths, from, starvation, and, disease, and, a, million, refugees, fleeing, the, country, mainly, to, america, irish, attempts, to, break, away, continued, with, parnell, s, irish, parliamentary, party, which, strove, from, the, 1880s, to, attain, home, rule, through, the, parliamentary, constitutional, movement, eventually, winning, the, home, rule, act, 1914, although, this, act, was, suspended, at, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, in, 1916, the, easter, rising, succeeded, in, turning, public, opinion, against, the, british, establishment, after, the, execution, of, the, leaders, by, british, authorities, it, also, eclipsed, the, home, rule, movement, in, 1922, after, the, irish, war, of, independence, most, of, ireland, seceded, from, the, united, kingdom, to, become, the, independent, irish, free, state, but, under, the, anglo, irish, treaty, the, six, northeastern, counties, known, as, northern, ireland, remained, within, the, united, kingdom, creating, the, partition, of, ireland, the, treaty, was, opposed, by, many, their, opposition, led, to, the, outbreak, of, the, irish, civil, war, in, which, irish, free, state, or, pro, treaty, forces, proved, victorious, the, history, of, northern, ireland, has, since, been, dominated, by, the, division, of, society, along, sectarian, faultlines, and, conflict, between, mainly, catholic, irish, nationalists, and, mainly, protestant, british, unionists, these, divisions, erupted, into, the, troubles, in, the, late, 1960s, after, civil, rights, marches, were, met, with, opposition, by, authorities, the, violence, escalated, after, the, deployment, of, the, british, army, to, maintain, authority, led, to, clashes, with, nationalist, communities, the, violence, continued, for, twenty, eight, years, until, an, uneasy, but, largely, successful, peace, was, finally, achieved, with, the, good, friday, agreement, in, 1998, what, is, known, of, pre, christian, ireland, comes, from, references, in, roman, writings, irish, poetry, myth, and, archaeology, while, some, possible, paleolithic, tools, have, been, found, none, of, the, finds, is, convincing, of, paleolithic, settlement, in, ireland, however, a, bear, bone, found, in, alice, and, gwendoline, cave, county, clare, in, 1903, may, push, back, dates, for, the, earliest, human, settlement, of, ireland, to, 10, 500, bce, the, bone, shows, clear, signs, of, cut, marks, with, stone, tools, and, has, been, radiocarbon, dated, to, 12, 500, years, ago, it, is, possible, that, humans, crossed, a, land, bridge, during, the, warm, period, referred, to, as, the, b, lling, aller, d, warming, that, lasted, between, 14, 700, and, 12, 700, years, ago, i, e, between, 12, 700, bce, and, 10, 700, bce, towards, the, end, of, the, last, ice, age, and, allowed, the, reinhabitation, of, northern, europe, a, sudden, return, to, freezing, conditions, known, as, the, younger, dryas, cold, phase, which, lasted, from, 10, 900, bce, to, 9700, bce, may, have, depopulated, ireland, during, the, younger, dryas, sea, levels, continued, to, rise, and, no, ice, free, land, bridge, between, great, britain, and, ireland, ever, returned, the, earliest, confirmed, inhabitants, of, ireland, were, mesolithic, hunter, gatherers, who, arrived, sometime, around, 7900, bce, while, some, authors, take, the, view, that, a, land, bridge, connecting, ireland, to, great, britain, still, existed, at, that, time, more, recent, studies, indicate, that, ireland, was, separated, from, britain, by, c, 14, 000, bce, when, the, climate, was, still, cold, and, local, ice, caps, persisted, in, parts, of, the, country, the, people, remained, hunter, gatherers, until, about, 4000, bce, it, is, argued, this, is, when, the, first, signs, of, agriculture, started, to, show, leading, to, the, establishment, of, a, neolithic, culture, characterised, by, the, appearance, of, pottery, polished, stone, tools, rectangular, wooden, houses, megalithic, tombs, and, domesticated, sheep, and, cattle, some, of, these, tombs, as, at, knowth, and, dowth, are, huge, stone, monuments, and, many, of, them, such, as, the, passage, tombs, of, newgrange, are, astronomically, aligned, four, main, types, of, irish, megalithic, tombs, have, been, identified, dolmens, court, cairns, passage, tombs, and, wedge, shaped, gallery, graves, in, leinster, and, munster, individual, adult, males, were, buried, in, small, stone, structures, called, cists, under, earthen, mounds, and, were, accompanied, by, distinctive, decorated, pottery, this, culture, apparently, prospered, and, the, island, became, more, densely, populated, near, the, end, of, the, neolithic, new, types, of, monuments, developed, such, as, circular, embanked, enclosures, and, timber, stone, and, post, and, pit, circles, the, c, ide, fields, is, an, archaeological, site, on, the, north, county, mayo, coast, in, the, west, of, ireland, about, 7, kilometres, northwest, of, ballycastle, and, the, site, is, the, most, extensive, neolithic, site, in, ireland, and, contains, the, oldest, known, field, systems, in, the, world, using, various, dating, methods, it, was, discovered, that, the, creation, and, development, of, the, c, ide, fields, goes, back, some, five, and, a, half, thousand, years, 3500, bce, the, short, lived, irish, copper, age, and, subsequent, bronze, age, which, came, to, ireland, around, 2000, bce, saw, the, production, of, elaborate, gold, and, bronze, ornaments, weapons, and, tools, there, was, a, movement, away, from, the, construction, of, communal, megalithic, tombs, to, the, burial, of, the, dead, in, small, stone, cists, or, simple, pits, which, could, be, situated, in, cemeteries, or, in, circular, earth, or, stone, built, burial, mounds, known, respectively, as, barrows, and, cairns, as, the, period, progressed, inhumation, burial, gave, way, to, cremation, and, by, the, middle, bronze, age, remains, were, often, placed, beneath, large, burial, urns, during, the, late, bronze, age, there, was, an, increase, in, stored, weapons, which, has, been, taken, as, evidence, for, greater, warfare, fleshed, bog, bodies, also, appear, at, this, time, continuing, into, the, iron, age, the, iron, age, in, ireland, began, about, 600, bce, the, period, between, the, start, of, the, iron, age, and, the, historic, period, ce, 431, saw, the, gradual, infiltration, of, small, groups, of, celtic, speaking, people, into, ireland, with, items, of, the, continental, celtic, la, tene, style, being, found, in, at, least, the, northern, part, of, the, island, by, about, 300, bce, the, result, of, a, gradual, blending, of, celtic, and, indigenous, cultures, would, result, in, the, emergence, of, gaelic, culture, by, the, fifth, century, it, is, also, during, the, fifth, century, that, the, main, over, kingdoms, of, in, tuisceart, airgialla, ulaid, mide, laigin, mumhain, c, iced, ol, nechmacht, began, to, emerge, see, kingdoms, of, ancient, ireland, within, these, kingdoms, a, rich, culture, flourished, the, society, of, these, kingdoms, was, dominated, by, an, upper, class, consisting, of, aristocratic, warriors, and, learned, people, which, possibly, included, druids, linguists, realised, from, the, 17th, century, onwards, that, the, language, spoken, by, these, people, the, goidelic, languages, was, a, branch, of, the, celtic, languages, this, is, usually, explained, as, a, result, of, invasions, by, celts, from, the, continent, however, other, research, has, postulated, that, the, culture, developed, gradually, and, continuously, and, that, the, introduction, of, celtic, language, and, elements, of, celtic, culture, may, have, been, a, result, of, cultural, exchange, with, celtic, groups, in, southwest, continental, europe, from, the, neolithic, to, the, bronze, age, the, hypothesis, that, the, native, late, bronze, age, inhabitants, gradually, absorbed, celtic, influences, has, since, been, supported, by, some, recent, genetic, research, in, 60, ce, it, is, said, that, the, romans, invaded, anglesey, in, wales, causing, concerns, across, the, irish, sea, but, there, is, a, small, controversy, on, if, they, even, set, foot, into, ireland, the, closest, rome, got, to, conquering, ireland, was, in, 80, ce, when, according, to, turtle, bunbury, from, the, irish, times, t, athal, techtmar, the, son, of, a, deposed, high, king, who, is, said, to, have, invaded, ireland, from, afar, in, order, to, regain, his, kingdom, at, about, this, time, the, romans, referred, to, ireland, as, hibernia, around, ce, 100, ptolemy, in, ce, 100, recorded, ireland, s, geography, and, tribes, ireland, was, never, a, part, of, the, roman, empire, but, roman, influence, was, often, projected, well, beyond, its, borders, tacitus, writes, that, an, exiled, irish, prince, was, with, agricola, in, roman, britain, and, would, return, to, seize, power, in, ireland, juvenal, tells, us, that, roman, arms, had, been, taken, beyond, the, shores, of, ireland, in, recent, years, some, experts, have, hypothesized, that, roman, sponsored, gaelic, forces, or, perhaps, even, roman, regulars, mounted, some, kind, of, invasion, around, ce, 100, but, the, exact, relationship, between, rome, and, the, dynasties, and, peoples, of, hibernia, remains, unclear, irish, confederations, the, scoti, attacked, and, some, settled, in, britain, during, the, great, conspiracy, of, 367, in, particular, the, d, l, riata, settled, in, western, scotland, and, the, western, isles, the, middle, centuries, of, the, first, millennium, ce, marked, great, changes, in, ireland, politically, what, appears, to, have, been, a, prehistoric, emphasis, on, tribal, affiliation, had, been, replaced, by, the, 8th, century, by, patrilineal, dynasties, ruling, the, island, s, kingdoms, many, formerly, powerful, kingdoms, and, peoples, disappeared, irish, pirates, struck, all, over, the, coast, of, western, britain, in, the, same, way, that, the, vikings, would, later, attack, ireland, some, of, these, founded, entirely, new, kingdoms, in, pictland, and, to, a, lesser, degree, in, parts, of, cornwall, wales, and, cumbria, the, attacotti, of, south, leinster, may, even, have, served, in, the, roman, military, in, the, mid, to, late, 300s, perhaps, it, was, some, of, the, latter, returning, home, as, rich, mercenaries, merchants, or, slaves, stolen, from, britain, or, gaul, that, first, brought, the, christian, faith, to, ireland, some, early, sources, claim, that, there, were, missionaries, active, in, southern, ireland, long, before, st, patrick, whatever, the, route, and, there, were, probably, many, this, new, faith, was, to, have, the, most, profound, effect, on, the, irish, tradition, maintains, that, in, a, d, 432, st, patrick, arrived, on, the, island, and, in, the, years, that, followed, worked, to, convert, the, irish, to, christianity, st, patrick, s, confession, in, latin, written, by, him, is, the, earliest, irish, historical, document, it, gives, some, information, about, the, saint, on, the, other, hand, according, to, prosper, of, aquitaine, a, contemporary, chronicler, palladius, was, sent, to, ireland, by, the, pope, in, 431, as, first, bishop, to, the, irish, believing, in, christ, which, demonstrates, that, there, were, already, christians, living, in, ireland, palladius, seems, to, have, worked, purely, as, bishop, to, irish, christians, in, the, leinster, and, meath, kingdoms, while, patrick, who, may, have, arrived, as, late, as, 461, worked, first, and, foremost, as, a, missionary, to, the, pagan, irish, in, the, more, remote, kingdoms, in, ulster, and, connacht, patrick, is, traditionally, credited, with, preserving, and, codifying, irish, laws, and, changing, only, those, that, conflicted, with, christian, practices, he, is, credited, with, introducing, the, roman, alphabet, which, enabled, irish, monks, to, preserve, parts, of, the, extensive, oral, literature, the, historicity, of, these, claims, remains, the, subject, of, debate, and, there, is, no, direct, evidence, linking, patrick, with, any, of, these, accomplishments, the, myth, of, patrick, as, scholars, refer, to, it, was, developed, in, the, centuries, after, his, death, irish, scholars, excelled, in, the, study, of, latin, learning, and, christian, theology, in, the, monasteries, that, flourished, shortly, thereafter, missionaries, from, ireland, to, england, and, continental, europe, spread, the, news, of, the, flowering, of, learning, and, scholars, from, other, nations, came, to, irish, monasteries, the, excellence, and, isolation, of, these, monasteries, helped, preserve, latin, learning, during, the, early, middle, ages, the, period, of, insular, art, mainly, in, the, fields, of, illuminated, manuscripts, metalworking, and, sculpture, flourished, and, produced, such, treasures, as, the, book, of, kells, the, ardagh, chalice, and, the, many, carved, stone, crosses, that, dot, the, island, insular, style, was, to, be, a, crucial, ingredient, in, the, formation, of, the, romanesque, and, gothic, styles, throughout, western, europe, sites, dating, to, this, period, include, clochans, ringforts, and, promontory, forts, francis, john, byrne, describes, the, effect, of, the, epidemics, which, occurred, during, this, era, the, plagues, of, the, 660s, and, the, 680s, had, a, traumatic, effect, on, irish, society, the, golden, age, of, the, saints, was, over, together, with, the, generation, of, kings, who, could, fire, a, saga, writer, s, imagination, the, literary, tradition, looks, back, to, the, reign, of, the, sons, of, aed, slaine, diarmait, and, blathmac, who, died, in, 665, as, to, the, end, of, an, era, antiquaries, brehons, genealogists, and, hagiographers, felt, the, need, to, collect, ancient, traditions, before, they, were, totally, forgotten, many, were, in, fact, swallowed, by, oblivion, when, we, examine, the, writing, of, tirechan, we, encounter, obscure, references, to, tribes, that, are, quite, unknown, to, the, later, genealogical, tradition, the, laws, describe, a, society, that, was, obsolescent, and, the, meaning, and, use, of, the, word, moccu, dies, out, with, archaic, old, irish, at, the, beginning, of, the, new, century, the, first,

live, in, ireland, in, summer, 684, an, english, expeditionary, force, sent, by, northumbrian, king, ecgfrith, raided, brega, the, first, recorded, viking, raid, in, irish, history, occurred, in, 795, ce, when, vikings, from, norway, looted, the, island, early, viking, raids, were, generally, fast, paced, and, small, in, scale, these, early, raids, interrupted, the, golden, age, of, christian, irish, culture, and, marked, the, beginning, of, two, centuries, of, intermittent, warfare, with, waves, of, viking, raiders, plundering, monasteries, and, towns, throughout, ireland, most, of, those, early, raiders, came, from, western, norway, the, vikings, were, expert, sailors, who, travelled, in, longships, and, by, the, early, 840s, had, begun, to, establish, settlements, along, the, irish, coasts, and, to, spend, the, winter, months, there, the, longships, were, technologically, advanced, allowing, them, to, travel, faster, through, the, narrow, rivers, vikings, founded, settlements, in, several, places, most, famously, in, dublin, most, of, the, settlements, were, near, the, water, allowing, the, vikings, to, trade, using, their, longships, written, accounts, from, this, time, early, to, mid, 840s, show, that, the, vikings, were, moving, further, inland, to, attack, often, using, rivers, and, then, retreating, to, their, coastal, headquarters, in, 852, the, vikings, landed, in, dublin, bay, and, established, a, fortress, dublin, became, the, centre, for, the, trade, of, many, goods, especially, slaves, bringing, back, new, ideas, and, motivations, they, began, settling, more, permanently, in, the, tenth, century, an, earthen, bank, was, constructed, around, the, city, with, a, second, larger, bank, built, outside, that, in, the, eleventh, century, on, the, interior, of, the, town, an, extensive, series, of, defences, have, been, excavated, at, fishamble, street, dublin, the, site, featured, nine, waterfronts, including, two, possible, flood, banks, and, two, positive, defensive, embankments, during, the, viking, age, the, early, embankments, were, non, defensive, being, only, one, metre, high, and, it, is, uncertain, how, much, of, the, site, they, encircled, after, several, generations, a, group, of, mixed, irish, and, norse, ethnic, background, arose, the, gall, gaels, gall, being, the, old, irish, word, for, foreign, the, second, wave, of, vikings, made, stations, at, winter, bases, called, longphorts, to, serve, as, control, centres, to, exert, a, more, localized, force, on, the, island, through, raiding, the, third, wave, in, 917, established, towns, as, not, only, control, centres, but, also, as, centres, of, trade, to, enter, into, irish, economy, and, greater, western, europe, returning, to, dublin, they, set, up, a, market, town, over, the, next, century, a, great, period, of, economic, growth, would, spread, across, the, pastoral, country, the, vikings, brought, ireland, into, their, wide, ranging, system, of, international, trade, as, well, as, popularizing, a, silver, based, economy, with, local, trade, and, the, first, minting, of, coins, in, 997, in, 902, m, el, finnia, mac, flannacain, of, brega, and, cerball, mac, muirec, in, of, leinster, joined, forces, against, dublin, and, the, heathens, were, driven, from, ireland, i, e, from, the, fortress, of, th, cliath, they, were, allowed, by, the, saxons, to, settle, in, wirral, england, but, would, however, later, return, to, retake, dublin, the, vikings, never, achieved, total, domination, of, ireland, often, fighting, for, and, against, various, irish, kings, the, great, high, king, of, ireland, brian, boru, defeated, the, vikings, at, the, battle, of, clontarf, in, 1014, which, began, the, decline, of, viking, power, in, ireland, but, the, towns, which, vikings, had, founded, continued, to, flourish, and, trade, became, an, important, part, of, the, irish, economy, brian, boru, by, more, or, less, unifying, ireland, changed, the, high, kingship, in, the, way, that, the, high, king, would, now, have, more, power, and, control, over, the, country, and, could, manage, the, country, s, affairs, this, led, to, prosperity, for, ireland, over, the, next, few, years, the, irish, economy, grew, as, international, trade, became, more, common, the, towns, founded, by, the, vikings, continued, to, grow, and, thrive, as, centres, of, irish, trade, and, finance, they, remain, so, to, this, day, despite, the, breaking, of, norse, power, in, ireland, the, norse, still, maintained, control, of, the, kingdom, of, dublin, although, the, king, of, leinster, levied, tribute, from, the, norse, they, rarely, directly, intervened, in, the, affairs, of, the, city, state, as, it, brought, trade, to, the, area, this, changed, however, when, diarmuit, mac, ma, l, na, mb, king, of, leinster, captured, dublin, in, 1052, this, gave, the, irish, greater, access, to, the, kingdom, of, the, isles, diarmuit, was, able, to, become, high, king, of, ireland, and, after, his, death, the, o, brien, dynasty, who, ruled, ireland, since, the, days, of, brian, boru, reclaimed, the, high, kingship, and, irish, influence, in, the, irish, sea, area, would, increase, dramatically, over, the, next, few, decades, notably, under, high, king, muircherteach, ua, briain, who, was, noted, for, his, interest, in, foreign, affairs, perhaps, it, was, muircherteach, s, increasing, power, in, the, isles, that, led, magnus, barefoot, king, of, norway, to, lead, campaigns, against, the, irish, in, 1098, and, again, in, 1102, to, bring, norse, areas, back, under, norwegian, control, while, also, raiding, the, various, british, kingdoms, although, direct, conflict, with, the, kingdom, of, norway, seemed, imminent, the, two, kings, formed, an, alliance, by, the, marriage, of, muircherteach, s, daughter, to, magnus, son, the, two, would, campaign, together, in, ulster, until, magnus, was, killed, in, an, ambush, by, the, ulaid, in, august, 1103, under, mysterious, circumstances, it, is, possible, muircherteach, ordered, his, killing, muircherteach, was, also, politically, involved, in, the, kingdoms, of, scotland, and, england, as, well, as, wales, one, of, the, most, prosperous, reigns, of, any, high, king, was, the, reign, of, toirdelbach, ua, conchobhair, who, had, overthrown, muircherteach, and, partitioned, munster, in, 1118, as, king, of, connacht, and, then, king, of, ireland, ireland, underwent, a, period, of, modernization, and, elevation, on, the, european, stage, under, his, rule, the, first, castles, in, ireland, were, built, bringing, improved, defence, and, brought, a, new, aspect, to, irish, warfare, he, also, built, a, naval, base, and, castle, at, d, n, gaillimhe, a, settlement, grew, around, this, castle, which, would, grow, to, be, the, city, of, galway, today, he, was, a, superb, military, commander, and, this, allowed, him, to, keep, control, of, ireland, with, the, help, of, the, castles, he, built, and, his, fleet, based, at, d, n, gaillimhe, he, also, had, commercial, and, political, links, with, the, rulers, of, france, spain, and, england, increasing, ireland, s, international, presence, which, brought, more, trade, to, the, island, his, reign, lasted, more, than, 50, years, one, of, tairrdelbach, s, sons, ruadhr, would, later, go, on, to, be, high, king, himself, he, was, arguably, the, first, high, king, without, opposition, however, he, would, later, abdicate, following, the, norman, invasion, of, ireland, by, the, 12th, century, ireland, was, divided, politically, into, shifting, petty, kingdoms, and, over, kingdoms, power, was, exercised, by, the, heads, of, a, few, regional, dynasties, vying, against, each, other, for, supremacy, over, the, whole, island, one, of, these, men, king, diarmait, mac, murchada, of, leinster, was, forcibly, exiled, by, the, new, high, king, ruaidri, mac, tairrdelbach, ua, conchobair, of, the, western, kingdom, of, connacht, fleeing, to, aquitaine, diarmait, obtained, permission, from, henry, ii, to, recruit, norman, knights, to, regain, his, kingdom, the, first, norman, knights, landed, in, ireland, in, 1167, followed, by, the, main, forces, of, normans, welsh, and, flemings, several, counties, were, restored, to, the, control, of, diarmait, who, named, his, son, in, law, the, norman, richard, de, clare, known, as, strongbow, heir, to, his, kingdom, this, troubled, king, henry, who, feared, the, establishment, of, a, rival, norman, state, in, ireland, accordingly, he, resolved, to, establish, his, authority, in, 1177, prince, john, lackland, was, made, lord, of, ireland, by, his, father, henry, ii, of, england, at, the, council, of, oxford, with, the, authority, of, the, papal, bull, laudabiliter, from, adrian, iv, henry, landed, with, a, large, fleet, at, waterford, in, 1171, becoming, the, first, king, of, england, to, set, foot, on, irish, soil, henry, awarded, his, irish, territories, to, his, younger, son, john, with, the, title, dominus, hiberniae, lord, of, ireland, when, john, unexpectedly, succeeded, his, brother, as, king, john, of, england, the, lordship, of, ireland, fell, directly, under, the, english, crown, the, normans, initially, controlled, the, entire, east, coast, from, waterford, to, eastern, ulster, and, penetrated, a, considerable, distance, inland, as, well, the, counties, were, ruled, by, many, smaller, kings, the, first, lord, of, ireland, was, king, john, who, visited, ireland, in, 1185, and, 1210, and, helped, consolidate, the, norman, controlled, areas, while, ensuring, that, the, many, irish, kings, swore, fealty, to, him, throughout, the, thirteenth, century, the, policy, of, the, english, kings, was, to, weaken, the, power, of, the, norman, lords, in, ireland, for, example, king, john, encouraged, hugh, de, lacy, to, destabilise, and, then, overthrow, the, lord, of, ulster, before, naming, him, as, the, first, earl, of, ulster, the, hiberno, norman, community, suffered, from, a, series, of, invasions, that, ceased, the, spread, of, their, settlement, and, power, politics, and, events, in, gaelic, ireland, served, to, draw, the, settlers, deeper, into, the, orbit, of, the, irish, furthermore, unlike, the, anglo, normans, the, gaelic, kings, did, not, keep, detailed, estate, inventories, and, accounts, coupled, with, the, absence, of, archaeological, evidence, to, the, contrary, this, has, tempted, many, scholars, of, medieval, western, ireland, to, agree, with, the, twelfth, century, historian, giraldus, cambrensis, who, argued, that, the, gaelic, kings, did, not, build, castles, by, 1261, the, weakening, of, the, normans, had, become, manifest, when, fineen, maccarthy, defeated, a, norman, army, at, the, battle, of, callann, the, war, continued, between, the, different, lords, and, earls, for, about, 100, years, causing, much, destruction, especially, around, dublin, in, this, chaotic, situation, local, irish, lords, won, back, large, amounts, of, land, that, their, families, had, lost, since, the, conquest, and, held, them, after, the, war, was, over, the, black, death, arrived, in, ireland, in, 1348, because, most, of, the, english, and, norman, inhabitants, of, ireland, lived, in, towns, and, villages, the, plague, hit, them, far, harder, than, it, did, the, native, irish, who, lived, in, more, dispersed, rural, settlements, after, it, had, passed, gaelic, irish, language, and, customs, came, to, dominate, the, country, again, the, english, controlled, territory, shrank, to, a, fortified, area, around, dublin, the, pale, whose, rulers, had, little, real, authority, outside, beyond, the, pale, by, the, end, of, the, 15th, century, central, english, authority, in, ireland, had, all, but, disappeared, england, s, attentions, were, diverted, by, the, wars, of, the, roses, the, lordship, of, ireland, lay, in, the, hands, of, the, powerful, fitzgerald, earl, of, kildare, who, dominated, the, country, by, means, of, military, force, and, alliances, with, irish, lords, and, clans, around, the, country, local, gaelic, and, gaelicised, lords, expanded, their, powers, at, the, expense, of, the, english, government, in, dublin, but, the, power, of, the, dublin, government, was, in, any, case, seriously, curtailed, by, the, introduction, of, poynings, law, in, 1494, according, to, this, act, the, irish, parliament, was, essentially, put, under, the, control, of, the, westminster, parliament, from, 1536, henry, viii, of, england, decided, to, reconquer, ireland, and, bring, it, under, crown, control, the, fitzgerald, dynasty, of, kildare, who, had, become, the, effective, rulers, of, ireland, in, the, 15th, century, had, become, unreliable, allies, of, the, tudor, monarchs, they, had, invited, burgundian, troops, into, dublin, to, crown, the, yorkist, pretender, lambert, simnel, as, king, of, england, in, 1487, again, in, 1536, silken, thomas, fitzgerald, went, into, open, rebellion, against, the, crown, having, put, down, this, rebellion, henry, resolved, to, bring, ireland, under, english, government, control, so, the, island, would, not, become, a, base, for, future, rebellions, or, foreign, invasions, of, england, in, 1542, he, upgraded, ireland, from, a, lordship, to, a, full, kingdom, henry, was, proclaimed, king, of, ireland, at, a, meeting, of, the, irish, parliament, that, year, this, was, the, first, meeting, of, the, irish, parliament, to, be, attended, by, the, gaelic, irish, chieftains, as, well, as, the, hiberno, norman, aristocracy, with, the, institutions, of, government, in, place, the, next, step, was, to, extend, the, control, of, the, english, kingdom, of, ireland, over, all, of, its, claimed, territory, this, took, nearly, a, century, with, various, english, administrations, either, negotiating, or, fighting, with, the, independent, irish, and, old, english, lords, the, spanish, armada, in, ireland, suffered, heavy, losses, during, an, extraordinary, season, of, storms, in, the, autumn, of, 1588, among, the, survivors, was, captain, francisco, de, cuellar, who, gave, a, remarkable, account, of, his, experiences, on, the, run, in, ireland, the, re, conquest, was, completed, during, the, reigns, of, elizabeth, and, james, i, after, several, brutal, conflicts, see, the, desmond, rebellions, 1569, 73, and, 1579, 83, and, the, nine, years, war, 1594, 1603, for, details, after, this, point, the, english, authorities, in, dublin, established, real, control, over, ireland, for, the, first, time, bringing, a, centralised, government, to, the, entire, island, and, successfully, disarmed, the, native, lordships, in, 1614, the, catholic, majority, in, the, irish, parliament, was, overthrown, through, the, creation, of, numerous, new, boroughs, which, were, dominated, by, the, new, settlers, however, the, english, were, not, successful, in, converting, the, catholic, irish, to, the, protestant, religion, and, the, brutal, methods, used, by, crown, authority, including, resorting, to, martial, law, to, bring, the, country, under, english, control, heightened, resentment, of, english, rule, from, the, mid, 16th, to, the, early, 17th, century, crown, governments, had, carried, out, a, policy, of, land, confiscation, and, colonisation, known, as, plantations, scottish, and, english, protestant, colonists, were, sent, to, the, provinces, of, munster, ulster, and, the, counties, of, laois, and, offaly, these, protestant, settlers, replaced, the, irish, catholic, landowners, who, were, removed, from, their, lands, these, settlers, formed, the, ruling, class, of, future, british, appointed, administrations, in, ireland, several, penal, laws, aimed, at, catholics, baptists, and, presbyterians, were, introduced, to, encourage, conversion, to, the, established, anglican, church, of, ireland, the, 17th, century, was, perhaps, the, bloodiest, in, ireland, s, history, two, periods, of, war, 1641, 53, and, 1689, 91, caused, a, huge, loss, of, life, the, ultimate, dispossession, of, most, of, the, irish, catholic, landowning, class, was, engineered, and, recusants, were, subordinated, under, the, penal, laws, during, the, 17th, century, ireland, was, convulsed, by, eleven, years, of, warfare, beginning, with, the, rebellion, of, 1641, when, irish, catholics, rebelled, against, the, domination, of, english, and, protestant, settlers, the, catholic, gentry, briefly, ruled, the, country, as, confederate, ireland, 1642, 1649, against, the, background, of, the, wars, of, the, three, kingdoms, until, oliver, cromwell, reconquered, ireland, in, 1649, 1653, on, behalf, of, the, english, commonwealth, cromwell, s, conquest, was, the, most, brutal, phase, of, the, war, by, its, close, around, half, of, ireland, s, pre, war, population, was, killed, or, exiled, as, slaves, where, many, died, due, to, harsh, conditions, as, retribution, for, the, rebellion, of, 1641, the, better, quality, remaining, lands, owned, by, irish, catholics, were, confiscated, and, given, to, british, settlers, several, hundred, remaining, native, landowners, were, transplanted, to, connacht, ireland, became, the, main, battleground, after, the, glorious, revolution, of, 1688, when, the, catholic, james, ii, left, london, and, the, english, parliament, replaced, him, with, william, of, orange, the, wealthier, irish, catholics, backed, james, to, try, to, reverse, the, penal, laws, and, land, confiscations, whereas, protestants, supported, william, and, mary, in, this, glorious, revolution, to, preserve, their, property, in, the, country, james, and, william, fought, for, the, kingdom, of, ireland, in, the, williamite, war, most, famously, at, the, battle, of, the, boyne, in, 1690, where, james, s, outnumbered, forces, were, defeated, from, the, 15th, to, the, 18th, century, irish, english, scots, and, welsh, prisoners, were, transported, for, forced, labour, in, the, caribbean, to, work, off, their, term, of, punishment, even, larger, numbers, came, voluntarily, as, indentured, servants, in, the, 18th, century, they, were, sent, to, the, american, colonies, and, in, the, early, 19th, century, to, australia, the, irish, were, dehumanised, by, the, english, described, as, savages, so, making, their, displacement, appear, all, the, more, justified, in, 1654, the, british, parliament, gave, oliver, cromwell, a, free, hand, to, banish, irish, undesirables, cromwell, rounded, up, catholics, throughout, the, irish, countryside, and, placed, them, on, ships, bound, for, the, caribbean, mainly, the, island, of, barbados, by, 1655, 12, 000, political, prisoners, had, been, forcibly, shipped, to, barbados, and, into, indentured, servitude, the, majority, of, the, people, of, ireland, were, catholic, peasants, they, were, very, poor, and, largely, inert, politically, during, the, eighteenth, century, as, many, of, their, leaders, converted, to, protestantism, to, avoid, severe, economic, and, political, penalties, nevertheless, there, was, a, growing, catholic, cultural, awakening, underway, there, were, two, protestant, groups, the, presbyterians, in, ulster, in, the, north, lived, in, much, better, economic, conditions, but, had, virtually, no, political, power, power, was, held, by, a, small, group, of, anglo, irish, families, who, were, loyal, to, the, anglican, church, of, ireland, they, owned, the, great, bulk, of, the, farmland, where, the, work, was, done, by, the, catholic, peasants, many, of, these, families, lived, in, england, and, were, absentee, landlords, whose, loyalty, was, basically, to, england, the, anglo, irish, who, lived, in, ireland, became, increasingly, identified, as, irish, nationalists, and, were, resentful, of, the, english, control, of, their, island, their, spokesmen, such, as, jonathan, swift, and, edmund, burke, sought, more, local, control, jacobite, resistance, in, ireland, eventually, ended, after, the, battle, of, aughrim, in, july, 1691, the, penal, laws, that, had, been, relaxed, somewhat, after, the, restoration, were, reinforced, more, thoroughly, after, this, war, as, the, infant, anglo, irish, ascendancy, wanted, to, ensure, that, the, irish, roman, catholics, would, not, be, in, a, position, to, repeat, their, rebellions, power, was, held, by, the, 5, who, were, protestants, belonging, to, the, church, of, ireland, they, controlled, all, major, sectors, of, the, irish, economy, the, bulk, of, the, farmland, the, legal, system, local, government, and, held, strong, majorities, in, both, houses, of, the, irish, parliament, they, strongly, distrusted, the, presbyterians, in, ulster, and, were, convinced, that, the, catholics, should, have, minimal, rights, they, did, not, have, full, political, control, because, the, government, in, london, had, superior, authority, and, treated, ireland, as, a, backward, colony, when, the, american, colonies, revolted, in, the, 1770s, the, ascendency, wrested, multiple, concessions, to, strengthen, its, power, they, did, not, seek, independence, because, they, knew, they, were, heavily, outnumbered, and, ultimately, depended, upon, the, british, army, to, guarantee, their, security, subsequent, irish, antagonism, toward, england, was, aggravated, by, the, economic, situation, of, ireland, in, the, 18th, century, some, absentee, landlords, managed, their, estates, inefficiently, and, food, tended, to, be, produced, for, export, rather, than, for, domestic, consumption, two, very, cold, winters, near, the, end, of, the, little, ice, age, led, directly, to, a, famine, between, 1740, and, 1741, which, killed, about, 400, 000, people, and, caused, over, 150, 000, irish, to, leave, the, island, in, addition, irish, exports, were, reduced, by, the, navigation, acts, from, the, 1660s, which, placed, tariffs, on, irish, products, entering, england, but, exempted, english, goods, from, tariffs, on, entering, ireland, despite, this, most, of, the, 18th, century, was, relatively, peaceful, in, comparison, with, the, preceding, two, centuries, and, the, population, doubled, to, over, four, million, by, the, 18th, century, the, anglo, irish, ruling, class, had, come, to, see, ireland, not, england, as, their, native, country, a, parliamentary, faction, led, by, henry, grattan, agitated, for, a, more, favourable, trading, relationship, with, great, britain, and, for, greater, legislative, independence, for, the, irish, parliament, however, reform, in, ireland, stalled, over, the, more, radical, proposals, toward, enfranchising, irish, catholics, this, was, partially, enabled, in, 1793, but, catholics, could, not, yet, become, members, of, the, irish, parliament, or, become, government, officials, some, were, attracted, to, the, more, militant, example, of, the, french, revolution, of, 1789, presbyterians, and, dissenters, too, faced, persecution, on, a, lesser, scale, and, in, 1791, a, group, of, dissident, protestant, individuals, all, of, whom, but, two, were, presbyterians, held, the, first, meeting, of, what, would, become, the, society, of, the, united, irishmen, originally, they, sought, to, reform, the, irish, parliament, which, was, controlled, by, those, belonging, to, the, state, church, seek, catholic, emancipation, and, help, remove, religion, from, politics, when, their, ideals, seemed, unattainable, they, became, more, determined, to, use, force, to, overthrow, british, rule, and, found, a, non, sectarian, republic, their, activity, culminated, in, the, irish, rebellion, of, 1798, which, was, bloodily, suppressed, ireland, was, a, separate, kingdom, ruled, by, king, george, iii, of, britain, he, set, policy, for, ireland, through, his, appointment, of, the, lord, lieutenant, of, ireland, or, viceroy, in, practice, the, viceroys, lived, in, england, and, the, affairs, in, the, island, were, largely, controlled, by, an, elite, group, of, irish, protestants, known, as, undertakers, the, system, changed, in, 1767, with, the, appointment, of, an, english, politician, who, became, a, very, strong, viceroy, george, townshend, served, 1767, 72, and, was, in, residence, in, the, castle, in, dublin, townsend, had, the, strong, support, of, both, the, king, and, the, british, cabinet, in, london, and, all, major, decisions, were, basically, made, in, london, the, ascendancy, complained, and, obtained, a, series, of, new, laws, in, the, 1780s, that, made, the, irish, parliament, effective, and, independent, of, the, british, parliament, although, still, under, the, supervision, of, the, king, and, his, privy, council, largely, in, response, to, the, 1798, rebellion, irish, self, government, was, ended, altogether, by, the, provisions, of, the, acts, of, union, 1800, which, abolished, the, irish, parliament, of, that, era, in, 1800, following, the, irish, rebellion, of, 1798, the, irish, and, the, british, parliaments, enacted, the, acts, of, union, the, merger, created, a, new, political, entity, called, united, kingdom, of, great, britain, and, ireland, with, effect, from, 1, january, 1801, part, of, the, agreement, forming, the, basis, of, union, was, that, the, test, act, would, be, repealed, to, remove, any, remaining, discrimination, against, roman, catholics, presbyterians, baptists, and, other, dissenter, religions, in, the, newly, united, kingdom, however, king, george, iii, invoking, the, provisions, of, the, act, of, settlement, 1701, controversially, and, adamantly, blocked, attempts, by, prime, minister, william, pitt, the, younger, pitt, resigned, in, protest, but, his, successor, henry, addington, and, his, new, cabinet, failed, to, legislate, to, repeal, or, change, the, test, act, this, was, followed, by, the, first, irish, reform, act, 1832, which, allowed, catholic, members, of, parliament, but, raised, the, property, qualification, to, 10, effectively, removing, the, poorer, irish, freeholders, from, the, franchise, in, 1823, an, enterprising, catholic, lawyer, daniel, o, connell, known, in, ireland, as, the, liberator, began, an, ultimately, successful, irish, campaign, to, achieve, emancipation, and, to, be, seated, in, the, parliament, this, culminated, in, o, connell, s, successful, election, in, the, clare, by, election, which, revived, the, parliamentary, efforts, at, reform, the, roman, catholic, relief, act, 1829, was, eventually, approved, by, the, uk, parliament, under, the, leadership, of, the, dublin, born, prime, minister, arthur, wellesley, 1st, duke, of, wellington, this, indefatigable, anglo, irish, statesman, a, former, chief, secretary, for, ireland, and, hero, of, the, napoleonic, wars, guided, the, legislation, through, both, houses, of, parliament, by, threatening, to, resign, he, persuaded, george, iv, to, sign, the, bill, into, law, in, 1829, the, continuing, obligation, of, catholics, to, fund, the, established, church, of, ireland, however, led, to, the, sporadic, skirmishes, of, the, tithe, war, of, 1831, 38, the, church, was, disestablished, by, the, gladstone, government, in, the, irish, church, act, 1869, the, continuing, enactment, of, parliamentary, reform, during, the, ensuing, administrations, further, extended, the, initially, limited, franchise, daniel, o, connell, later, led, the, repeal, association, in, an, unsuccessful, campaign, to, undo, the, act, of, union, 1800, the, great, irish, famine, an, gorta, m, r, was, the, second, of, ireland, s, great, famines, it, struck, the, country, during, 1845, 49, with, potato, blight, exacerbated, by, the, political, factors, of, the, time, leading, to, mass, starvation, and, emigration, the, impact, of, emigration, in, ireland, was, severe, the, population, dropped, from, over, 8, million, before, the, famine, to, 4, 4, million, in, 1911, gaelic, or, irish, once, the, island, s, spoken, language, declined, in, use, sharply, in, the, nineteenth, century, as, a, result, of, the, famine, and, the, creation, of, the, national, school, education, system, as, well, as, hostility, to, the, language, from, leading, irish, politicians, of, the, time, it, was, largely, replaced, by, english, outside, mainstream, nationalism, a, series, of, violent, rebellions, by, irish, republicans, took, place, in, 1803, under, robert, emmet, in, 1848, a, rebellion, by, the, young, irelanders, most, prominent, among, them, thomas, francis, meagher, and, in, 1867, another, insurrection, by, the, irish, republican, brotherhood, all, failed, but, physical, force, nationalism, remained, an, undercurrent, in, the, nineteenth, century, a, central, issue, throughout, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, was, land, ownership, a, small, group, of, about, 10, 000, english, families, owned, practically, all, the, farmland, most, were, permanent, residents, of, england, and, seldom, presented, the, land, they, rented, it, out, to, irish, tenant, farmers, falling, behind, in, rent, payments, meant, eviction, and, very, bad, feelings, often, violence, the, late, 19th, century, witnessed, major, land, reform, spearheaded, by, the, land, league, under, michael, davitt, demanding, what, became, known, as, the, 3, fs, fair, rent, free, sale, fixity, of, tenure, parliament, passed, laws, in, 1870, 1881, 1903, and, 1909, that, enabled, most, tenant, farmers, to, purchase, their, lands, and, lowered, the, rents, of, the, others, from, 1870, and, as, a, result, of, the, land, war, agitations, and, subsequent, plan, of, campaign, of, the, 1880s, various, british, governments, introduced, a, series, of, irish, land, acts, william, o, brien, played, a, leading, role, in, the, 1902, land, conference, to, pave, the, way, for, the, most, advanced, social, legislation, in, ireland, since, the,

itself, a, republic, in, 1949, while, the, 6, county, northern, ireland, gaining, home, rule, for, itself, remained, part, of, the, united, kingdom, for, most, of, the, next, 75, years, each,

and, a, major, world, economic, downturn, in, 1929, in, contrast, with, many, contemporary, european, states, it, remained, a, democracy, testament, to, this, came, when, the, losing, faction, in, the, irish, civil, war, amon, de, valera, s, fianna, f, il, was, able, to, take, power, peacefully, by, winning, the, 1932, general, election, nevertheless, until, the, mid, 1930s, considerable, parts, of, irish, society, saw, the, free, state, through, the, prism, of, the, civil, war, as, a, repressive, british, imposed, state, it, was, only, the, peaceful, change, of, government, in, 1932, that, signalled, the, final, acceptance, of, the, free, state, on, their, part, in, contrast, to, many, other, states, in, the, period, the, free, state, remained, financially, solvent, as, a, result,

among, all, the, population, due, to, a, lack, of, economic, opportunity, the, rate, of, protestant, emigration, was, disproportionate, in, this, period, many, protestants, left, the, country, in, the, early, 1920s, either, because, they, felt, unwelcome, in, a, predominantly, catholic, and, nationalist, state, because, they, were, afraid, due, to, the, burning, of, protestant, homes, particularly, of, the, old, landed, class, by, republicans, during, the, civil, war, because, they, regarded, themselves, as, british, and, did, not, wish, to, live, in, an, independent, irish, state, or, because, of, the, economic, disruption, caused, by, the, recent, violence, the, catholic, church, had, also, issued, a, decree, known, as, ne, temere, whereby, the, children, of, marriages, between, catholics, and, protestants, had, to, be, brought, up, as, catholics, from, 1945, the, emigration, rate, of, protestants, fell, and, they, became, less, likely, to, emigrate, than, catholics,

governed, by, a, unionist, government, based, at, stormont, in, east, belfast, unionist, leader, and, first, prime, minister, james, craig, declared, that, it, would, be, a, protestant, state, for, a, protestant, people, craig, s, goal, was, to, form, and, preserve, protestant, authority, in, the, new, state, which, was, above, all, an, effort, to, secure, a, unionist, majority, in, 1926, the,

acknowledgment, catholics, rallied, together, to, achieve, a, similar, socio, political, recognition, this, resulted, in, the, formation, of, various, organisations, such, as, the, northern, ireland, civil, rights, association, nicra, in, 1967, and, the, campaign, for, social, justice, csj, in, 1964, non, violent, protest, became, an, increasingly, important, factor, in, mobilising, catholic, sympathies, and, opinion, and, thus, more, effective, in, generating, support, than, actively, violent, groups, such, as, the, ira, however, these, non, violent, protests, posed, a, problem, to, northern, ireland, s, prime, minister, terrance, o, neil, 1963, because, it, hampered, his, efforts, to, persuade, catholics, in, northern, ireland, that, they, too, like, their, protestant, counterparts, belong, within, the, united, kingdom, despite, o, neil, s, reforming, efforts, there, was, growing, discontent, amongst, both, catholics, and, unionists, in, october, 1968, a, peaceful, civil, rights, march, in, derry, turned, violent, as, police, brutally, beat, protesters, the, outbreak, was, televised, by, international, media, and, as, a, result, the, march, was, highly, publicised, which, further, confirmed, the, socio, political, turmoil, in, ireland, a, violent, counter, reaction, from, conservative, unionists, led, to, civil, disorder, notably, the, battle, of, the, bogside, and, the, northern, ireland, riots, of, august, 1969, to, restore, order, british, troops, were, deployed, to, the, streets, of, northern, ireland, at, that, time, the, violent, outbreaks, in, the, late, 1960s, encouraged, and, helped, strengthen, military, groups, such, as, the, ira, who, served, as, the, protectors, of, the, working, class, catholics, who, were, vulnerable, to, police, and, civilian, brutality, during, the, late, sixties, and, early, seventies, recruitment, into, the, ira, organisation, dramatically, increased, as, street, and, civilian, violence, worsened, the, interjection, from, the, british, troops, proved, to, be, insufficient, to, quell, the, violence, and, thus, solidified, the, ira, s, growing, military, importance, on, 30, january, 1972, the, worst, tensions, came, to, a, head, with, the, events, of, bloody, sunday, paratroops, opened, fire, on, civil, rights, protesters, in, derry, killing, 13, unarmed, civilians, bloody,

both, the, nationalist, and, unionist, communities, by, the, northern, ireland, constitution, act, of, 1973, and, the, sunningdale, agreement, in, december, 1973, both, acts, however, did, little, to,
