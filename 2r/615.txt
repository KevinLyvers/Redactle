babylon, was, an, ancient, city, located, on, the, lower, euphrates, river, in, southern, mesopotamia, within, modern, day, hillah, iraq, about, 85, kilometers, 55, miles, south, of, modern, day, baghdad, babylon, functioned, as, the, main, cultural, and, political, centre, of, the, akkadian, speaking, region, of, babylonia, its, rulers, established, two, important, empires, in, antiquity, the, 19th, 16th, century, bc, old, babylonian, empire, and, the, 7th, 6th, century, bc, neo, babylonian, empire, babylon, was, also, used, as, a, regional, capital, of, other, empires, such, as, the, achaemenid, empire, babylon, was, one, of, the, most, important, urban, centres, of, the, ancient, near, east, until, its, decline, during, the, hellenistic, period, nearby, ancient, sites, are, kish, borsippa, dilbat, and, kutha, the, earliest, known, mention, of, babylon, as, a, small, town, appears, on, a, clay, tablet, from, the, reign, of, shar, kali, sharri, 2217, 2193, bc, of, the, akkadian, empire, babylon, was, merely, a, religious, and, cultural, centre, at, this, point, and, neither, an, independent, state, nor, a, large, city, subject, to, the, akkadian, empire, after, the, collapse, of, the, akkadian, empire, the, south, mesopotamian, region, was, dominated, by, the, gutian, dynasty, for, a, few, decades, before, the, rise, of, the, third, dynasty, of, ur, which, encompassed, the, whole, of, mesopotamia, including, the, town, of, babylon, the, town, became, part, of, a, small, independent, city, state, with, the, rise, of, the, first, babylonian, empire, now, known, as, the, old, babylonian, empire, in, the, 17th, century, bc, the, amorite, king, hammurabi, founded, the, short, lived, old, babylonian, empire, in, the, 16th, century, bc, he, built, babylon, into, a, major, city, and, declared, himself, its, king, southern, mesopotamia, became, known, as, babylonia, and, babylon, eclipsed, nippur, as, the, region, s, holy, city, the, empire, waned, under, hammurabi, s, son, samsu, iluna, and, babylon, spent, long, periods, under, assyrian, kassite, and, elamite, domination, after, the, assyrians, destroyed, and, then, rebuilt, it, babylon, became, the, capital, of, the, short, lived, neo, babylonian, empire, from, 626, to, 539, bc, the, hanging, gardens, of, babylon, were, ranked, as, one, of, the, seven, wonders, of, the, ancient, world, allegedly, existing, between, approximately, 600, bc, and, ad, 1, however, there, are, questions, about, whether, the, hanging, gardens, of, babylon, even, existed, as, there, is, no, mention, within, any, extant, babylonian, texts, of, its, existence, after, the, fall, of, the, neo, babylonian, empire, the, city, came, under, the, rule, of, the, achaemenid, seleucid, parthian, roman, sassanid, and, muslim, empires, the, last, known, habitation, of, the, town, dates, from, the, 11th, century, when, it, was, referred, to, as, the, small, village, of, babel, it, has, been, estimated, that, babylon, was, the, largest, city, in, the, world, c, 1770, c, 1670, bc, and, again, c, 612, c, 320, bc, it, was, perhaps, the, first, city, to, reach, a, population, above, 200, 000, estimates, for, the, maximum, extent, of, its, area, range, from, 890, 3, sq, mi, to, 900, ha, 2, 200, acres, the, main, sources, of, information, about, babylon, excavation, of, the, site, itself, references, in, cuneiform, texts, found, elsewhere, in, mesopotamia, references, in, the, bible, descriptions, in, other, classical, writing, especially, by, herodotus, and, second, hand, descriptions, citing, the, work, of, ctesias, and, berossus, present, an, incomplete, and, sometimes, contradictory, picture, of, the, ancient, city, even, at, its, peak, in, the, sixth, century, bc, unesco, inscribed, babylon, as, a, world, heritage, site, in, 2019, the, site, receives, thousands, of, visitors, each, year, almost, all, of, whom, are, iraqis, construction, is, rapidly, increasing, which, has, caused, encroachments, upon, the, ruins, the, spelling, babylon, is, the, latin, representation, of, greek, babyl, n, derived, from, the, native, babylonian, b, bilim, meaning, gate, of, the, god, s, the, cuneiform, spelling, was, k, dig, ir, ra, ki, this, would, correspond, to, the, sumerian, phrase, kan, dig, irak, the, sign, k, is, the, logogram, for, gate, dig, ir, means, god, and, ra, represents, the, coda, of, the, word, dig, ir, r, followed, by, the, genitive, suffix, ak, the, final, ki, is, a, determinative, indicating, that, the, previous, signs, are, to, be, understood, as, a, place, name, archibald, sayce, writing, in, the, 1870s, postulated, that, the, semitic, name, was, a, loan, translation, of, the, original, sumerian, name, however, the, gate, of, god, interpretation, is, increasingly, viewed, as, a, semitic, folk, etymology, to, explain, an, unknown, original, non, semitic, placename, i, j, gelb, in, 1955, argued, that, the, original, name, was, babilla, of, unknown, meaning, and, origin, as, there, were, other, similarly, named, places, in, sumer, and, there, are, no, other, examples, of, sumerian, place, names, being, replaced, with, akkadian, translations, he, deduced, that, it, later, transformed, into, akkadian, b, b, ili, m, and, that, the, sumerian, name, kan, dig, irak, was, a, loan, translation, of, the, semitic, folk, etymology, and, not, the, original, name, the, re, translation, of, the, semitic, name, into, sumerian, would, have, taken, place, at, the, time, of, the, neo, sumerian, third, dynasty, of, ur, bab, il, a, fragmentary, inscription, dating, to, the, early, dynastic, period, likely, in, the, akkadian, language, refers, to, an, unknown, lord, who, was, the, governor, ensi, of, bar, ki, bar, and, constructed, the, temple, for, marduk, indicating, that, the, city, could, very, well, be, babylon, during, the, ed, iii, period, sign, placement, was, relatively, fluid, and, so, the, ki, sign, could, be, seen, as, the, determinative, with, the, name, of, the, city, as, bar, bar, perhaps, pronounced, babbar, paul, alain, beaulieu, proposes, that, the, original, name, could, mean, shining, glowing, or, white, it, would, be, likely, that, it, was, later, read, as, babbir, and, then, babbil, by, swapping, the, consonant, r, with, l, the, earliest, unambiguous, mention, to, the, city, babylon, came, from, one, of, shar, kali, sharri, s, year, names, spelled, as, ka, dingir, ki, indicating, that, the, folk, etymology, was, already, widely, known, in, the, sargonic, period, however, the, original, form, of, the, name, babbar, babbir, was, not, forgotten, as, seen, from, the, phonetic, spelling, ba, ab, b, lum, in, the, ur, iii, period, and, the, spellings, pambalu, and, babalu, in, the, kassite, period, another, attested, spelling, for, the, city, of, babylon, is, tin, tir, ki, attested, sparsely, in, the, old, babylonian, period, but, grew, in, popularity, in, the, late, 2nd, millennium, bc, and, was, in, widespread, usage, in, the, 1st, millennium, bc, the, spelling, e, ki, also, appears, in, the, 1st, millennium, bc, in, the, hebrew, bible, the, name, appears, as, babel, hebrew, bavel, tib, b, el, classical, syriac, b, w, l, imperial, aramaic, b, el, in, arabic, b, bil, interpreted, in, the, book, of, genesis, to, mean, confusion, from, the, verb, bilb, l, to, confuse, the, modern, english, verb, to, babble, to, speak, foolish, excited, or, confusing, talk, is, popularly, thought, to, derive, from, this, name, but, there, is, no, direct, connection, in, pali, and, sanskrit, literature, the, name, appears, as, b, veru, ancient, records, in, some, situations, use, babylon, as, a, name, for, other, cities, including, cities, like, borsippa, within, babylon, s, sphere, of,

more, and, less, than, i, actually, did, less, because, i, could, have, formed, no, conception, of, the, prodigious, extent, of, the, whole, ruins, or, of, the, size, solidity, and, perfect, state, of, some, of, the, parts, of, them, and, more, because, i, thought, that, i, should, have, distinguished, some, traces, however, imperfect, of, many, of, the, principal, structures, of, babylon, i, imagined, i, should, have, said, here, were, the, walls, and, such, must, have, been, the, extent, of, the, area, there, stood, the, palace, and, this, most, assuredly, was, the, tower, of, belus, i,

william, loftus, visited, there, in, 1849, austen, henry, layard, made, some, soundings, during, a, brief, visit, in, 1850, before, abandoning, the, site, fulgence, fresnel, julius, oppert, and, felix, thomas, heavily, excavated, babylon, from, 1852, to, 1854, much, of, their, work, was, lost, in, the, qurnah, disaster, when, a, transport, ship, and, four, rafts, sank, on, the, tigris, river, in, may, 1855, they, had, been, carrying, over, 200, crates, of, artifacts, from, various, excavation, missions, when, they, were, attacked, by, tigris, river, pirates, near, al, qurnah, recovery,

unsuccessful, henry, rawlinson, and, george, smith, worked, there, briefly, in, 1854, the, next, excavation, was, conducted, by, hormuzd, rassam, on, behalf, of, the, british, museum, work, began, in, 1879, continuing, until, 1882, and, was, prompted, by, widespread, looting, of, the, site, using, industrial, scale, digging, in, search, of, artifacts, rassam, recovered, a, large, quantity, of, cuneiform, tablets, and, other, finds, the, zealous, excavation, methods, common, at, the, time, caused, significant, damage, to, the, archaeological, context, many, tablets, had, appeared, on, the, market, in, 1876, before, rassam, s, excavation, began, a, team, from, the, german, oriental, society, led, by, robert, koldewey, conducted, the, first, scientific, archaeological, excavations, at, babylon, the, work, was, conducted, daily, from, 1899, until, 1917, a, major, problem, for, koldewey, was, the, large, scale, mining, of, baked, bricks, which, began, in, the, 19th, century, and, which, were, mainly, sourced, from, the, time, of, nebuchadnezzar, ii, at, the, time, excavations, for, brick, mining, for, various, building, projects, including, the, hindiya, dam, were, under, way, the, primary, efforts, of, the, dig, involved, the, temple, of, marduk, and, the, processional, way, leading, up, to, it, as, well, as, the, city, wall, artifacts, including, pieces, of, the, ishtar, gate, and, hundreds, of, recovered, tablets, were, sent, back, to, germany, where, koldewey, s, colleague, walter, andrae, reconstructed, them, into, displays, at, the, vorderasiatisches, museum, berlin, the, koldewey, expedition, recovered, artifacts, from, the, old, babylonian, period, these, included, 967, clay, tablets, with, 564, tablets, from, the, middle, babylonian, period, stored, in, private, houses, with, sumerian, literature, and, lexical, documents, the, german, archaeologists, fled, before, oncoming, british, troops, in, 1917, and, again, many, objects, went, missing, in, the, following, years, further, work, by, the, german, archaeological, institute, was, conducted, by, heinrich, j, lenzen, in, 1956, and, hansj, rg, schmid, in, 1962, working, the, hellenistic, parthian, sasanian, and, arabic, levels, of, the, site, lenzen, s, work, dealt, primarily, with, the, hellenistic, theatre, and, schmid, focused, on, the, temple, ziggurat, etemenanki, a, topographical, survey, at, the, site, was, conducted, in, 1974, followed, in, 1977, by, a, review, of, the, stratigraphical, position, of, the, main, monuments, and, reconsideration, of, ancient, water, levels, by, the, turin, centre, for, archaeological, research, and, excavations, in, the, middle, east, and, asia, and, the, iraqi, italian, institute, of, archaeological, sciences, the, focus, was, on, clearing, up, issues, raised, by, re, examination, of, the, old, german, data, additional, work, in, 1987, 1989, concentrated, on, the, area, surrounding, the, ishara, and, ninurta, temples, in, the, shu, anna, city, quarter, of, babylon, a, number, of, iraqi, excavations, have, occurred, at, babylon, the, earliest, in, 1938, from, 1979, 1981, excavation, and, restoration, work, was, conducted, at, the, ninmah, temple, istar, temple, and, the, southern, palace, occasional, excavations, and, restorations, continued, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, during, the, restoration, efforts, in, babylon, the, iraqi, state, organization, for, antiquities, and, heritage, conducted, extensive, research, excavation, and, clearing, but, wider, publication, of, these, archaeological, activities, has, been, limited, most, of, the, known, tablets, from, all, modern, excavations, remain, unpublished, the, main, sources, of, information, about, babylon, excavation, of, the, site, itself, references, in, cuneiform, texts, found, elsewhere, in, mesopotamia, references, in, the, bible, descriptions, in, other, classical, writing, especially, by, herodotus, and, second, hand, descriptions, citing, the, work, of, ctesias, and, berossus, present, an, incomplete, and, sometimes, contradictory, picture, of, the, ancient, city, even, at, its, peak, in, the, sixth, century, bc, babylon, was, described, perhaps, even, visited, by, a, number, of, classical, historians, including, ctesias, herodotus, quintus, curtius, rufus, strabo, and, cleitarchus, these, reports, are, of, variable, accuracy, and, some, of, the, content, was, politically, motivated, but, these, still, provide, useful, information, historical, knowledge, of, early, babylon, must, be, pieced, together, from, epigraphic, remains, found, elsewhere, such, as, at, uruk, nippur, sippar, mari, and, haradum, the, earliest, known, mention, of, babylon, as, a, small, town, appears, on, a, clay, tablet, from, the, reign, of, shar, kali, sharri, 2217, 2193, bc, of, the, akkadian, empire, references, to, the, city, of, babylon, can, be, found, in, akkadian, and, sumerian, literature, from, the, late, third, millennium, bc, one, of, the, earliest, is, a, tablet, describing, the, akkadian, king, ar, kali, arri, laying, the, foundations, in, babylon, of, new, temples, for, ann, n, tum, and, ilaba, babylon, also, appears, in, the, administrative, records, of, the, third, dynasty, of, ur, which, collected, in, kind, tax, payments, and, appointed, an, ensi, as, local, governor, the, so, called, weidner, chronicle, also, known, as, abc, 19, states, that, sargon, of, akkad, c, 23rd, century, bc, in, the, short, chronology, had, built, babylon, in, front, of, akkad, abc, 19, 51, a, later, chronicle, states, that, sargon, dug, up, the, dirt, of, the, pit, of, babylon, and, made, a, counterpart, of, babylon, next, to, akkad, abc, 20, 18, 19, van, de, mieroop, has, suggested, that, those, sources, may, refer, to, the, much, later, assyrian, king, sargon, ii, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, rather, than, sargon, of, akkad, ctesias, quoted, by, diodorus, siculus, and, in, george, syncellus, s, chronographia, claimed, to, have, access, to, manuscripts, from, babylonian, archives, which, date, the, founding, of, babylon, to, 2286, bc, under, the, reign, of, its, first, king, belus, a, similar, figure, is, found, in, the, writings, of, berossus, who, according, to, pliny, stated, that, astronomical, observations, commenced, at, babylon, 490, years, before, the, greek, era, of, phoroneus, indicating, 2243, bc, stephanus, of, byzantium, wrote, that, babylon, was, built, 1002, years, before, the, date, given, by, hellanicus, of, lesbos, for, the, siege, of, troy, 1229, bc, which, would, date, babylon, s, foundation, to, 2231, bc, all, of, these, dates, place, babylon, s, foundation, in, the, 23rd, century, bc, however, cuneiform, records, have, not, been, found, to, correspond, with, these, classical, post, cuneiform, accounts, the, first, attested, mention, of, babylon, was, in, the, late, 3rd, millennium, bc, during, the, akkadian, empire, reign, of, ruler, shar, kali, sharri, one, of, whose, year, names, mentions, building, two, temples, there, babylon, was, ruled, by, ensi, governors, for, the, empire, some, of, the, known, governors, were, abba, ar, i, a, it, r, ilum, murteli, unabatal, and, puzur, tutu, after, that, nothing, is, heard, of, the, city, until, the, time, of, sumu, la, el, after, around, 1950, bc, amorite, kingdoms, will, appear, in, uruk, and, larsa,

the, neighboring, city, state, of, kazallu, sumu, la, el, whose, dates, may, be, concurrent, with, those, of, sumu, abum, is, usually, given, as, the, progenitor, of, the, first, babylonian, dynasty,

that, lasted, for, 435, years, until, 1160, bc, babylon, was, weakened, during, the, kassite, era, and, as, a, result, kassite, babylon, began, paying, tribute, to, the, pharaoh, of, egypt, thutmose, iii, following, his, eighth, campaign, against, mitanni, kassite, babylon, eventually, became, subject, to, the, middle, assyrian, empire, 1365, 1053, bc, to, the, north, and, elam, to, the, east, with, both, powers, vying, for, control, of, the, city, by, 1155, bc, after, continued, attacks, and, annexing, of, territory, by, the, assyrians, and, elamites, the, kassites, were, deposed, in, babylon, an, akkadian, south, mesopotamian, dynasty, then, ruled, for, the, first, time, however, babylon, remained, weak, and, subject, to, domination, by, assyria, its, ineffectual, native, kings, were, unable, to, prevent, new, waves, of, foreign, west, semitic, settlers, from, the, deserts, of, the, levant, including, the, arameans, and, suteans, in, the, 11th, century, bc, and, finally, the, chaldeans, in, the, 9th, century, bc, entering, and, appropriating, areas, of, babylonia, for, themselves, the, arameans, briefly, ruled, in, babylon, during, the, late, 11th, century, bc, during,

in, a, constant, state, of, revolt, led, by, a, chieftain, named, merodach, baladan, in, alliance, with, the, elamites, and, suppressed, only, by, the, complete, destruction, of, the, city, of, babylon, in, 689, bc, its, walls, temples, and, palaces, were, razed, and, the, rubble, was, thrown, into, the, arakhtu, the, sea, bordering, the, earlier, babylon, on, the, south, the, destruction,

the, help, of, other, peoples, against, assyria, including, elam, persia, the, chaldeans, and, suteans, of, southern, mesopotamia, and, the, canaanites, and, arabs, dwelling, in, the, deserts, south, of, mesopotamia, once, again, babylon, was, besieged, by, the, assyrians, starved, into, surrender, and, its, allies, were, defeated, ashurbanipal, celebrated, a, service, of, reconciliation, but, did, not, venture, to, take, the, hands, of, bel, an, assyrian, governor, named, kandalanu, was, appointed, as, ruler, of, the, city, ashurbanipal, did, collect, texts, from, babylon, for, inclusion, in, his, extensive, library, at, ninevah, under, nabopolassar, babylon, escaped, assyrian, rule, and, the, allied, medo, babylonian, armies, destroyed, the, assyrian, empire, between, 626, bc, and, 609, bc, babylon, thus, became, the, capital, of, the, neo, babylonian, sometimes, called, the, chaldean, empire, with, the, recovery, of, babylonian, independence, a, new, era, of, architectural, activity, ensued, particularly, during, the, reign, of, his, son, nebuchadnezzar, ii, 604, 561, bc, nebuchadnezzar, ordered, the, complete, reconstruction, of, the, imperial, grounds, including, the, etemenanki, ziggurat, and, the, construction, of, the, ishtar, gate, the, most, prominent, of, eight, gates, around, babylon, a, reconstruction, of, the, ishtar, gate, is, located, in, the, pergamon, museum, in, berlin, nebuchadnezzar, is, also, credited, with, the, construction, of, the, hanging, gardens, of, babylon, one, of, the, seven, wonders, of, the, ancient, world, said, to, have, been, built, for, his, homesick, wife, amytis, whether, the, gardens, actually, existed, is, a, matter, of, dispute, german, archaeologist, robert, koldewey, speculated, that, he, had, discovered, its, foundations, but, many, historians, disagree, about, the, location, stephanie, dalley, has, argued, that, the, hanging, gardens, were, actually, located, near, the, assyrian, capital, nineveh, nebuchadnezzar, is, also, notoriously, associated, with, the, babylonian, exile, of, the, jews, the, result, of, an, imperial, technique, of, pacification, used, also, by, the, assyrians, in, which, ethnic, groups, in, conquered, areas, were, deported, en, masse, to, the, capital, according, to, the, hebrew, bible, he, destroyed, solomon, s, temple, and, exiled, the, jews, to, babylon, the, defeat, was, also, recorded, in, the, babylonian, chronicles, in, 539, bc, the, neo, babylonian, empire, fell, to, cyrus, the, great, king, of, persia, with, a, military, engagement, known, as, the, battle, of, opis, babylon, s, walls, were, considered, impenetrable, the, only, way, into, the, city, was, through, one, of, its, many, gates, or, through, the, euphrates, river, metal, grates, were, installed, underwater, allowing, the, river, to, flow, through, the, city, walls, while, preventing, intrusion, the, persians, devised, a, plan, to, enter, the, city, via, the, river, during, a, babylonian, national, feast, cyrus, troops, upstream, diverted, the, euphrates, river, allowing, cyrus, soldiers, to, enter, the, city, through, the, lowered, water, the, persian, army, conquered, the, outlying, areas, of, the, city, while, the, majority, of, babylonians, at, the, city, center, were, unaware, of, the, breach, the, account, was, elaborated, upon, by, herodotus, and, is, mentioned, in, parts, of, the, hebrew, bible, herodotus, also, described, a, moat, an, enormously, tall, and, broad, wall, cemented, with, bitumen, and, with, buildings, on, top, and, a, hundred, gates, to, the, city, he, writes, that, the, babylonians, wear, turbans, and, perfume, and, bury, their, dead, in, honey, that, they, practice, ritual, prostitution, and, that, three, tribes, among, them, eat, nothing, but, fish, the, hundred, gates, can, be, considered, a, reference, to, homer, following, the, pronouncement, of, archibald, henry, sayce, in, 1883, herodotus, account, of, babylon, has, largely, been, considered, to, represent, greek, folklore, rather, than, an, authentic, voyage, to, babylon, however, recently, dalley, and, others, have, suggested, taking, herodotus, account, seriously, according, to, 2, chronicles, 36, of, the, hebrew, bible, cyrus, later, issued, a, decree, permitting, captive, people, including, the, jews, to, return, to, their, own, lands, the, text, found, on, the, cyrus, cylinder, has, traditionally, been, seen, by, biblical, scholars, as, corroborative, evidence, of, this, policy, although, the, interpretation, is, disputed, because, the, text, identifies, only, mesopotamian, sanctuaries, but, makes, no, mention, of, jews, jerusalem, or, judea, under, cyrus, and, the, subsequent, persian, king, darius, i, babylon, became, the, capital, city, of, the, 9th, satrapy, babylonia, in, the, south, and, athura, in, the, north, as, well, as, a, center, of, learning, and, scientific, advancement, in, achaemenid, persia, the, ancient, babylonian, arts, of, astronomy, and, mathematics, were, revitalized, and, babylonian, scholars, completed, maps, of, constellations, the, city, became, the, administrative, capital, of, the, persian, empire, and, remained, prominent, for, over, two, centuries, many, important, archaeological, discoveries, have, been, made, that, can, provide, a, better, understanding, of, that, era, the, early, persian, kings, had, attempted, to, maintain, the, religious, ceremonies, of, marduk, who, was, the, most, important, god, but, by, the, reign, of, darius, iii, over, taxation, and, the, strain, of, numerous, wars, led, to, a, deterioration, of, babylon, s, main, shrines, and, canals, and, the, destabilization, of, the, surrounding, region, there, were, numerous, attempts, at, rebellion, and, in, 522, bc, nebuchadnezzar, iii, 521, bc, nebuchadnezzar, iv, and, 482, bc, bel, shimani, and, shamash, eriba, native, babylonian, kings, briefly, regained, independence, however, these, revolts, were, quickly, repressed, and, babylon, remained, under, persian, rule, for, two, centuries, until, alexander, the, great, s, entry, in, 331, bc, in, october, of, 331, bc, darius, iii, the, last, achaemenid, king, of, the, persian, empire, was, defeated, by, the, forces, of, the, ancient, macedonian, ruler, alexander, the, great, at, the, battle, of, gaugamela, occupying, babylon, under, alexander, babylon, again, flourished, as, a, center, of, learning, and, commerce, however, following, alexander, s, death, in, 323, bc, in, the, palace, of, nebuchadnezzar, his, empire, was, divided, amongst, his, generals, the, diadochi, and, decades, of, fighting, soon, began, babylon, declined, somewhat, in, importance, but, remained, active, throughout, this, period, under, the, parthian, and, sassanid, empires, babylon, like, assyria, became, a, province, of, these, persian, empires, for, nine, centuries, until, after, ad, 650, although, it, was, captured, briefly, by, trajan, in, ad, 116, to, be, part, of, the, newly, conquered, province, of, mesopotamia, his, successor, hadrian, relinquished, his, conquests, east, of, the, euphrates, river, which, became, again, the, roman, empire, s, eastern, boundary, however, babylon, maintained, its, own, culture, and, people, who, spoke, varieties, of, aramaic, and, who, continued, to, refer, to, their, homeland, as, babylon, examples, of, their, culture, are, found, in, the, babylonian, talmud, the, gnostic, mandaean, religion, eastern, rite, christianity, and, the, religion, of, the, philosopher, mani, christianity, was, introduced, to, mesopotamia, in, the, 1st, and, 2nd, centuries, and, babylon, was, the, seat, of, a, bishop, of, the, church, of, the, east, until, well, after, the, arab, islamic, conquest, coins, from, the,
