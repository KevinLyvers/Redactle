the, merovingian, dynasty, m, r, v, n, d, i, n, was, the, ruling, family, of, the, franks, from, around, the, middle, of, the, 5th, century, until, 751, they, first, appear, as, kings, of, the, franks, in, the, roman, army, of, northern, gaul, by, 509, they, had, united, all, the, franks, and, northern, gallo, romans, under, their, rule, they, conquered, most, of, gaul, defeating, the, visigoths, 507, and, the, burgundians, 534, and, also, extended, their, rule, into, raetia, 537, in, germania, the, alemanni, bavarii, and, saxons, accepted, their, lordship, the, merovingian, realm, was, the, largest, and, most, powerful, of, the, states, of, western, europe, following, the, breakup, of, the, empire, of, theodoric, the, great, the, dynastic, name, medieval, latin, merovingi, or, merohingii, sons, of, merovech, derives, from, an, unattested, frankish, form, akin, to, the, attested, old, english, merew, owing, with, the, final, ing, being, a, typical, germanic, patronymic, suffix, the, name, derives, from, salian, king, merovech, who, is, at, the, center, of, many, legends, unlike, the, anglo, saxon, royal, genealogies, the, merovingians, never, claimed, descent, from, a, god, nor, is, there, evidence, that, they, were, regarded, as, sacred, the, merovingians, long, hair, distinguished, them, among, the, franks, who, commonly, cut, their, hair, short, contemporaries, sometimes, referred, to, them, as, the, long, haired, kings, latin, reges, criniti, a, merovingian, whose, hair, was, cut, could, not, rule, and, a, rival, could, be, removed, from, the, succession, by, being, tonsured, and, sent, to, a, monastery, the, merovingians, also, used, a, distinct, name, stock, one, of, their, names, clovis, evolved, into, louis, and, remained, common, among, french, royalty, down, to, the, 19th, century, the, first, well, known, merovingian, king, was, childeric, i, died, 481, his, son, clovis, i, died, 511, converted, to, nicene, christianity, united, the, franks, and, conquered, most, of, gaul, the, merovingians, treated, their, kingdom, as, single, yet, divisible, clovis, s, four, sons, divided, the, kingdom, among, themselves, and, it, remained, divided, until, 679, with, the, exception, of, four, short, periods, 558, 561, 613, 623, 629, 634, 673, 675, after, that, it, was, divided, again, only, once, 717, 718, the, main, divisions, of, the, kingdom, were, austrasia, neustria, burgundy, and, aquitaine, during, the, final, century, of, merovingian, rule, the, kings, were, increasingly, pushed, into, a, ceremonial, role, actual, power, was, increasingly, in, the, hands, of, the, mayor, of, the, palace, the, highest, ranking, official, under, the, king, in, 656, the, mayor, grimoald, i, tried, to, place, his, son, childebert, on, the, throne, in, austrasia, grimoald, was, arrested, and, executed, but, his, son, ruled, until, 662, when, the, merovingian, dynasty, was, restored, when, king, theuderic, iv, died, in, 737, the, mayor, charles, martel, continued, to, rule, the, kingdoms, until, his, death, in, 741, the, dynasty, was, restored, again, in, 743, but, in, 751, charles, s, son, pepin, the, short, deposed, the, last, king, childeric, iii, and, had, himself, crowned, initiating, the, carolingian, dynasty, the, 7th, century, chronicle, of, fredegar, implies, that, the, merovingians, were, descended, from, a, sea, beast, called, a, quinotaur, it, is, said, that, while, chlodio, was, staying, at, the, seaside, with, his, wife, one, summer, his, wife, went, into, the, sea, at, midday, to, bathe, and, a, beast, of, neptune, rather, like, a, quinotaur, found, her, in, the, event, she, was, made, pregnant, either, by, the, beast, or, by, her, husband, and, she, gave, birth, to, a, son, called, merovech, from, whom, the, kings, of, the, franks, have, subsequently, been, called, merovingians, in, the, past, this, tale, was, regarded, as, an, authentic, piece, of, germanic, mythology, and, was, often, taken, as, evidence, that, the, merovingian, kingship, was, sacral, and, the, royal, dynasty, of, supernatural, origin, today, it, is, more, commonly, seen, as, an, attempt, to, explain, the, meaning, of, the, name, merovech, sea, bull, unlike, the, anglo, saxon, rulers, the, merovingians, if, they, ever, themselves, acknowledged, the, quinotaur, tale, which, is, by, no, means, certain, made, no, claim, to, be, descended, from, a, god, in, 1906, the, british, egyptologist, flinders, petrie, suggested, that, the, marvingi, recorded, by, ptolemy, as, living, near, the, rhine, were, the, ancestors, of, the, merovingian, dynasty, in, 486, clovis, i, the, son, of, childeric, defeated, syagrius, a, roman, military, leader, who, competed, with, the, merovingians, for, power, in, northern, france, he, won, the, battle, of, tolbiac, against, the, alemanni, in, 496, according, to, gregory, of, tours, clovis, adopted, his, wife, clotilda, s, orthodox, i, e, nicene, christian, faith, at, a, time, when, other, germanic, tribes, were, largely, arian, he, subsequently, went, on, to, decisively, defeat, the, visigothic, kingdom, of, toulouse, in, the, battle, of, vouill, in, 507, after, clovis, s, death, his, kingdom, was, partitioned, among, his, four, sons, this, tradition, of, partition, continued, over, the, next, century, even, when, several, merovingian, kings, simultaneously, ruled, their, own, realms, the, kingdom, not, unlike, the, late, roman, empire, was, conceived, of, as, a, single, entity, ruled, collectively, by, these, several, kings, each, ruling, one, section, much, as, the, late, roman, empire, had, been, divided, between, up, to, four, emperors, the, death, of, one, or, more, of, these, kings, could, result, in, the, reunification, of, the, whole, kingdom, under, a, single, ruler, even, when, divided, under, different, kings, the, kingdom, maintained, unity, and, conquered, burgundy, in, 534, upon, clovis, s, death, in, 511, the, merovingian, kingdom, included, all, of, gaul, except, burgundy, and, all, of, germania, magna, except, saxony, after, the, fall, of, the, ostrogoths, the, franks, also, conquered, provence, after, this, their, borders, with, italy, ruled, by, the, lombards, since, 568, and, visigothic, septimania, remained, fairly, stable, 384, internally, the, kingdom, was, divided, among, clovis, s, sons, and, later, among, his, grandsons, and, frequently, saw, war, between, the, different, kings, who, allied, amongst, themselves, and, against, one, another, the, death, of, one, king, created, conflict, between, the, surviving, brothers, and, the, deceased, s, sons, with, differing, outcomes, later, conflicts, were, intensified, by, the, personal, feud, around, brunhilda, however, yearly, warfare, often, did, not, constitute, general, devastation, but, took, on, an, almost, ritual, character, with, established, rules, and, norms, eventually, clotaire, ii, in, 613, reunited, the, entire, frankish, realm, under, one, ruler, the, frequent, wars, had, weakened, royal, power, while, the, aristocracy, had, made, great, gains, and, procured, enormous, concessions, from, the, kings, in, return, for, their, support, these, concessions, saw, the, very, considerable, power, of, the, king, parcelled, out, and, retained, by, leading, comites, and, duces, counts, and, dukes, very, little, is, in, fact, known, about, the, course, of, the, 7th, century, due, to, a, scarcity, of, sources, but, merovingians, remained, in, power, until, the, 8th, century, clotaire, s, son, dagobert, i, died, 639, who, sent, troops, to, spain, and, pagan, slavic, territories, in, the, east, is, commonly, seen, as, the, last, powerful, merovingian, king, later, kings, are, known, as, rois, fain, ants, do, nothing, kings, despite, the, fact, that, only, the, last, two, kings, did, nothing, the, kings, even, strong, willed, men, like, dagobert, ii, and, chilperic, ii, were, not, the, main, agents, of, political, conflicts, leaving, this, role, to, their, mayors, of, the, palace, who, increasingly, substituted, their, own, interest, for, their, king, s, many, kings, came, to, the, throne, at, a, young, age, and, died, in, the, prime, of, life, weakening, royal, power, further, the, conflict, between, mayors, was, ended, when, the, austrasians, under, pepin, the, middle, triumphed, in, 687, in, the, battle, of, tertry, after, this, pepin, though, not, a, king, was, the, political, ruler, of, the, frankish, kingdom, and, left, this, position, as, a, heritage, to, his, sons, it, was, now, the, sons, of, the, mayor, that, divided, the, realm, among, each, other, under, the, rule, of, a, single, king, after, pepin, s, long, rule, his, son, charles, martel, assumed, power, fighting, against, nobles, and, his, own, stepmother, his, reputation, for, ruthlessness, further, undermined, the, king, s, position, under, charles, martel, s, leadership, the, franks, defeated, the, moors, at, the, battle, of, tours, in, 732, after, the, victory, of, 718, of, the, bulgarian, khan, tervel, and, the, emperor, of, byzantium, leo, iii, the, isaurian, over, the, arabs, led, by, maslama, ibn, abd, al, malik, prevented, the, attempts, of, islam, to, expand, into, eastern, europe, the, victory, of, charles, martel, at, tours, limited, its, expansion, onto, the, west, of, the, european, continent, during, the, last, years, of, his, life, he, even, ruled, without, a, king, though, he, did, not, assume, royal, dignity, his, sons, carloman, and, pepin, again, appointed, a, merovingian, figurehead, childeric, iii, to, stem, rebellion, on, the, kingdom, s, periphery, however, in, 751, pepin, finally, displaced, the, last, merovingian, and, with, the, support, of, the, nobility, and, the, blessing, of, pope, zachary, became, one, of, the, frankish, kings, the, merovingian, king, redistributed, conquered, wealth, among, his, followers, both, material, wealth, and, the, land, including, its, indentured, peasantry, though, these, powers, were, not, absolute, as, rouche, points, out, when, he, died, his, property, was, divided, equally, among, his, heirs, as, though, it, were, private, property, the, kingdom, was, a, form, of, patrimony, some, scholars, have, attributed, this, to, the, merovingians, lacking, a, sense, of, res, publica, but, other, historians, have, criticized, this, view, as, an, oversimplification, the, kings, appointed, magnates, to, be, comites, counts, charging, them, with, defense, administration, and, the, judgment, of, disputes, this, happened, against, the, backdrop, of, a, newly, isolated, europe, without, its, roman, systems, of, taxation, and, bureaucracy, the, franks, having, taken, over, administration, as, they, gradually, penetrated, into, the, thoroughly, romanised, west, and, south, of, gaul, by, the, time, of, dagobert, i, governmental, documents, were, recognizably, roman, it, is, by, then, written, in, latin, on, imported, papyrus, similar, to, roman, bureaucratic, norms, and, where, it, also, made, use, of, the, old, legal, formulae, while, laymen, made, up, most, of, the, administrators, there, was, a, gradual, shift, to, a, clerical, presence, from, the, reign, of, clotaire, ii, the, counts, had, to, provide, armies, enlisting, their, milites, and, endowing, them, with, land, in, return, these, armies, were, subject, to, the, king, s, call, for, military, support, annual, national, assemblies, of, the, nobles, and, their, armed, retainers, decided, major, policies, of, war, making, the, army, also, acclaimed, new, kings, by, raising, them, on, its, shields, continuing, an, ancient, practice, that, made, the, king, leader, of, the, warrior, band, furthermore, the, king, was, expected, to, support, himself, with, the, products, of, his, private, domain, royal, demesne, which, was, called, the, fisc, this, system, developed, in, time, into, feudalism, and, expectations, of, royal, self, sufficiency, lasted, until, the, hundred, years, war, trade, declined, with, the, fall, of, the, roman, empire, and, agricultural, estates, were, mostly, self, sufficient, the, remaining, international, trade, was, dominated, by, middle, eastern, merchants, often, jewish, radhanites, merovingian, law, was, not, universal, law, equally, applicable, to, all, it, was, applied, to, each, man, according, to, his, origin, ripuarian, franks, were, subject, to, their, own, lex, ripuaria, codified, at, a, late, date, while, the, so, called, lex, salica, salic, law, of, the, salian, clans, first, tentatively, codified, in, 511, was, invoked, under, medieval, exigencies, as, late, as, the, valois, era, in, this, the, franks, lagged, behind, the, burgundians, and, the, visigoths, that, they, had, no, universal, roman, based, law, in, merovingian, times, law, was, handled, by, officials, called, rachimburgs, who, memorised, the, set, of, legal, precedents, which, formed, the, basis, for, their, society, s, laws, for, merovingian, society, did, not, allow, the, concept, of, creating, new, law, only, of, maintaining, tradition, nor, did, its, germanic, traditions, offer, any, code, of, civil, law, required, of, urbanised, society, such, as, justinian, i, caused, to, be, assembled, and, promulgated, in, the, byzantine, empire, the, few, surviving, merovingian, edicts, are, almost, entirely, concerned, with, settling, divisions, of, estates, among, heirs, byzantine, coinage, was, in, use, in, francia, before, theudebert, i, began, minting, his, own, money, at, the, start, of, his, reign,

were, shrewdly, awarded, to, elites, who, supported, the, dynasty, extensive, parcels, of, land, were, donated, to, monasteries, to, exempt, those, lands, from, royal, taxation, and, to, preserve, them, within, the, family, the, family, maintained, dominance, over, the, monastery, by, appointing, family, members, as, abbots, extra, sons, and, daughters, who, could, not, be, married, off, were, sent, to, monasteries, so, that, they, would, not, threaten, the, inheritance, of, older, merovingian, children, this, pragmatic, use, of, monasteries, ensured, close, ties, between, elites, and, monastic, properties, numerous, merovingians, who, served, as, bishops, and, abbots, or, who, generously, funded, abbeys, and, monasteries, were, rewarded, with, sainthood, the, outstanding, handful, of, frankish, saints, who, were, not, of, the, merovingian, kinship, nor, the, family, alliances, that, provided, merovingian, counts, and, dukes, deserve, a, closer, inspection, for, that, fact, alone, like, gregory, of, tours, they, were, almost, without, exception, from, the, gallo, roman, aristocracy, in, regions, south, and, west, of, merovingian, control, the, most, characteristic, form, of, merovingian, literature, is, represented, by, the, lives, of, the, saints, merovingian, hagiography, did, not, set, out, to, reconstruct, a, biography, in, the, roman, or, the, modern, sense, but, to, attract, and, hold, popular, devotion, by, the, formulas, of, elaborate, literary, exercises, through, which, the, frankish, church, channeled, popular, piety, within, orthodox, channels, defined, the, nature, of, sanctity, and, retained, some, control, over, the, posthumous, cults, that, developed, spontaneously, at, burial, sites, where, the, life, force, of, the, saint, lingered, to, do, good, for, the, votary, the, vitae, et, miracula, for, impressive, miracles, were, an, essential, element, of, merovingian, hagiography, were, read, aloud, on, saints, feast, days, many, merovingian, saints, and, the, majority, of, female, saints, were, local, ones, venerated, only, within, strictly, circumscribed, regions, their, cults, were, revived, in, the, high, middle, ages, when, the, population, of, women, in, religious, orders, increased, enormously, judith, oliver, noted, five, merovingian, female, saints, in, the, diocese, of, li, ge, who, appeared, in, a, long, list, of, saints, in, the, late, 13th, century, lardanchet, psalter, hours, the, vitae, of, six, late, merovingian, saints, that, illustrate, the, political, history, of, the, era, have, been, translated, and, edited, by, paul, fouracre, and, richard, a, gerberding, and, presented, with, liber, historiae, francorum, to, provide, some, historical, context, yitzhak, hen, stated, that, it, seems, certain, that, the, gallo, roman, population, was, far, greater, than, the, frankish, population, in, merovingian, gaul, especially, in, regions, south, of, the, seine, with, most, of, the, frankish, settlements, being, located, along, the, lower, and, middle, rhine, the, further, south, in, gaul, one, traveled, the, weaker, the, frankish, influence, became, hen, finds, hardly, any, evidence, for, frankish, settlements, south, of, the, loire, the, absence, of, frankish, literature, sources, suggests, that, the, frankish, language, was, forgotten, rather, rapidly, after, the, early, stage, of, the, dynasty, hen, believes, that, for, neustria, burgundy, and, aquitania, vulgar, latin, remained, the, spoken, language, in, gaul, throughout, the, merovingian, period, and, remained, so, even, well, in, to, the, carolingian, period, however, urban, t, holmes, estimated, that, a, germanic, language, was, spoken, as, a, second, tongue, by, public, officials, in, western, austrasia, and, neustria, as, late, as, the, 850s, and, that, it, completely, disappeared, as, a, spoken, language, from, these, regions, only, during, the, 10th, century, a, limited, number, of, contemporary, sources, describe, the, history, of, the, merovingian, franks, but, those, that, survive, cover, the, entire, period, from, clovis, s, succession, to, childeric, s, deposition, first, among, chroniclers, of, the, age, is, the, canonised, bishop, of, tours, gregory, of, tours, his, decem, libri, historiarum, is, a, primary, source, for, the, reigns, of, the, sons, of, clotaire, ii, and, their, descendants, until, gregory, s, own, death, in, 594, but, must, be, read, with, account, of, the, pro, church, point, of, view, of, its, author, the, next, major, source, far, less, organised, than, gregory, s, work, is, the, chronicle, of, fredegar, begun, by, fredegar, but, continued, by, unknown, authors, it, covers, the, period, from, 584, to, 641, though, its, continuators, under, carolingian, patronage, extended, it, to, 768, after, the, close, of, the, merovingian, era, it, is, the, only, primary, narrative, source, for, much, of, its, period, the, only, other, major, contemporary, source, is, the, liber, historiae, francorum, an, anonymous, adaptation, of, gregory, s, work, apparently, ignorant, of, fredegar, s, chronicle, its, author, s, ends, with, a, reference, to, theuderic, iv, s, sixth, year, which, would, be, 727, it, was, widely, read, though, it, was, undoubtedly, a, piece, of, arnulfing, work, and, its, biases, cause, it, to, mislead, for, instance, concerning, the, two, decades, between, the, controversies, surrounding, mayors, grimoald, the, elder, and, ebroin, 652, 673, aside, from, these, chronicles, the, only, surviving, reservoirs, of, historiography, are, documentary, sources, letters, charters, laws, etc, and, hagiography, clerical, men, such, as, gregory, and, sulpitius, the, pious, were, letter, writers, though, relatively, few, letters, survive, edicts, grants, and, judicial, decisions, survive, as, well, as, the, famous, lex, salica, mentioned, above, from, the, reign, of, clotaire, ii, and, dagobert, i, survive, many, examples, of, the, royal, position, as, the, supreme, justice, and, final, arbiter, there, also, survive, biographies, of, saints, of, the, period, for, instance, saint, eligius, and, leodegar, written, soon, after, their, subjects, deaths, finally, archaeological, evidence, cannot, be, ignored, as, a, source, for, information, at, the, very, least, on, the, frankish, mode, of, life, among, the, greatest, discoveries, of, lost, objects, was, the, 1653, accidental, uncovering, of, childeric, i, s, tomb, in, the, church, of, saint, brice, in, tournai, the, grave, objects, included, a, golden, bull, s, head, and, the, famous, golden, insects, perhaps, bees, cicadas, aphids, or, flies, on, which, napoleon, modelled, his, coronation, cloak, in, 1957, the, sepulchre, of, a, merovingian, woman, at, the, time, believed, to, be, clotaire, i, s, second, wife, aregund, was, discovered, in, saint, denis, basilica, in, paris, the, funerary, clothing, and, jewellery, were, reasonably, well, preserved, giving, us, a, look, into, the, costume, of, the, time, beyond, these, royal, individuals, the, merovingian, period, is, associated, with, the, archaeological, reihengr, ber, culture, the, merovingians, play, a, prominent, role, in, french, historiography, and, national, identity, although, their, importance, was, partly, overshadowed, by, that, of, the, gauls, during, the, third, republic, charles, de, gaulle, is, on, record, as, stating, his, opinion, that, for, me, the, history, of, france, begins, with, clovis, elected, as, king, of, france, by, the, tribe, of, the, franks, who, gave, their, name, to, france, before, clovis, we, have, gallo, roman, and, gaulish, prehistory, the, decisive, element, for, me, is, that, clovis, was, the, first, king, to, have, been, baptized, a, christian, my, country, is, a, christian, country, and, i, reckon, the, history, of, france, beginning, with, the, accession, of, a, christian, king, who, bore, the, name, of, the, franks, the, merovingians, feature, in, the, novel, in, search, of, lost, time, by, marcel, proust, the, merovingians, are, important, to, proust, because, as, the, oldest, french, dynasty, they, are, the, most, romantic, and, their, descendants, the, most, aristocratic, the, word, merovingian, is, used, as, an, adjective, at, least, five, times, in, swann, s, way, the, merovingians, are, featured, in, the, book, the, holy, blood, and, the, holy, grail, 1982, where, they, are, depicted, as, descendants, of, jesus, inspired, by, the, priory, of, sion, story, developed, by, pierre, plantard, in, the, 1960s, plantard, playfully, sold, the, story, as, non, fiction, giving, rise, to, a, number, of, works, of, pseudohistory, among, which, the, holy, blood, and, the, holy, grail, was, the, most, successful, the, priory, of, sion, material, has, given, rise, to, later, works, in, popular, fiction, notably, the, da, vinci, code, 2003, which, mentions, the, merovingians, in, chapter, 60, the, title, of, merovingian, also, known, as, the, frenchman, is, used, as, the, name, for, a, fictional, character, and, a, supporting, antagonist, of, the, films, the, matrix, reloaded, the, matrix, revolutions, and, the, matrix, resurrections
