ideology, of, marxism, leninism, in, opposition, to, the, capitalist, western, bloc, the, eastern, bloc, was, often, called, the, second, world, whereas, the, term, first, world, referred, to, the, western, bloc, and, third, world, referred, to, the, non, aligned, countries, that, were, mainly, in, africa, asia, and, latin, america, but, notably, also, included, former, pre, 1948, soviet, ally, yugoslavia, which, was, located, in, europe, in, western, europe, the, term, eastern, bloc, generally, referred, to, the, ussr, and, central, and, eastern, european, countries, in, the, comecon, east, germany, poland, czechoslovakia, hungary, romania, bulgaria, and, albania, in, asia, the, eastern, bloc, comprised, mongolia, vietnam, laos, kampuchea, north, korea, south, yemen, syria, and, china, in, the, americas, the, countries, aligned, with, the, soviet, union, included, cuba, from, 1961, and, for, limited, periods, nicaragua, and, grenada, the, term, eastern, bloc, was, often, used, interchangeably, with, the, term, second, world, this, broadest, usage, of, the, term, would, include, not, only, maoist, china, and, cambodia, but, also, short, lived, soviet, satellites, such, as, the, second, east, turkestan, republic, 1944, 1949, the, people, s, republic, of, azerbaijan, 1945, 1946, and, the, republic, of, mahabad, 1946, as, well, as, the, marxist, leninist, states, straddling, the, second, and, third, worlds, before, the, end, of, the, cold, war, the, people, s, democratic, republic, of, yemen, from, 1967, the, people, s, republic, of, the, congo, from, 1969,

leadership, of, ba, athist, syria, officially, regarded, the, country, as, part, of, the, socialist, bloc, and, established, a, close, economic, military, alliance, with, the, soviet, union, many, states, were, accused, by, the, western, bloc, of, being, in, the, eastern, bloc, when, they, were, part, of, the, non, aligned, movement, the, most, limited, definition, of, the, eastern, bloc, would, only, include, the, warsaw, pact, states, and, the, mongolian, people, s, republic, as, former, satellite, states, most, dominated, by, the, soviet, union, cuba, s, defiance, of, complete, soviet, control, was, noteworthy, enough, that, cuba, was, sometimes, excluded, as, a, satellite, state, altogether, as, it, sometimes, intervened, in, other, third, world, countries, even, when, the, soviet, union, opposed, this, post, 1991, usage, of, the, term, eastern, bloc, may, be, more, limited, in, referring, to, the, states, forming, the, warsaw, pact, 1955, 1991, and, mongolia, 1924, 1991, which, are, no, longer, communist, states, sometimes, they, are, more, generally, referred, to, as, the, countries, of, eastern, europe, under, communism, excluding, mongolia, but, including, yugoslavia, and, albania, which, had, both, split, with, the, soviet, union, by, the, 1960s, even, though, yugoslavia, was, a, socialist, country, it, was, not, a, member, of, the, comecon, or, the, warsaw, pact, parting, with, the, ussr, in, 1948, yugoslavia, did, not, belong, to, the, east, but, it, also, did, not, belong, to, the, west, because, of, its, socialist, system, and, its, status, as, a, founding, member, of, the, non, aligned, movement, however, some, sources, consider, yugoslavia, to, be, a, member, of, the, eastern, bloc, others, consider, yugoslavia, not, to, be, a, member, after, it, broke, with, soviet, policy, in, the, 1948, tito, stalin, split, in, 1922, the, russian, sfsr, the, ukrainian, ssr, the, byelorussian, ssr, and, the, transcaucasian, sfsr, approved, the, treaty, of, creation, of, the, ussr, and, the, declaration, of, the, creation, of, the, ussr, forming, the, soviet, union, soviet, leader, joseph, stalin, who, viewed, the, soviet, union, as, a, socialist, island, stated, that, the, soviet, union, must, see, that, the, present, capitalist, encirclement, is, replaced, by, a, socialist, encirclement, in, 1939, the, ussr, entered, into, the, molotov, ribbentrop, pact, with, nazi, germany, that, contained, a, secret, protocol, that, divided, romania, poland, latvia, lithuania, estonia, and, finland, into, german, and, soviet, spheres, of, influence, eastern, poland, latvia, estonia, finland, and, bessarabia, in, northern, romania, were, recognized, as, parts, of, the, soviet, sphere, of, influence, lithuania, was, added, in, a, second, secret, protocol, in, september, 1939, the, soviet, union, had, invaded, the, portions, of, eastern, poland, assigned, to, it, by, the, molotov, ribbentrop, pact, two, weeks, after, the, german, invasion, of, western, poland, followed, by, co, ordination, with, german, forces, in, poland, during, the, occupation, of, east, poland, by, the, soviet, union, the, soviets, liquidated, the, polish, state, and, a, german, soviet, meeting, addressed, the, future, structure, of, the, polish, region, soviet, authorities, immediately, started, a, campaign, of, sovietization, of, the, newly, soviet, annexed, areas, soviet, authorities, collectivized, agriculture, and, nationalized, and, redistributed, private, and, state, owned, polish, property, initial, soviet, occupations, of, the, baltic, countries, had, occurred, in, mid, june, 1940, when, soviet, nkvd, troops, raided, border, posts, in, lithuania, estonia, and, latvia, followed, by, the, liquidation, of, state, administrations, and, replacement, by, soviet, cadres, elections, for, parliament, and, other, offices, were, held, with, single, candidates, listed, and, the, official, results, fabricated, purporting, pro, soviet, candidates, approval, by, 92, 8, percent, of, the, voters, in, estonia, 97, 6, percent, in, latvia, and, 99, 2, percent, in, lithuania, the, fraudulently, installed, people, s, assemblies, immediately, declared, each, of, the, three, corresponding, countries, to, be, soviet, socialist, republics, and, requested, their, admission, into, stalin, s, soviet, union, this, formally, resulted, in, the, soviet, union, s, annexation, of, lithuania, latvia, and, estonia, in, august, 1940, the, international, community, condemned, this, annexation, of, the, three, baltic, countries, and, deemed, it, illegal, in, 1939, the, soviet, union, unsuccessfully, attempted, an, invasion, of, finland, subsequent, to, which, the, parties, entered, into, an, interim, peace, treaty, granting, the, soviet, union, the, eastern, region, of, karelia, 10, of, finnish, territory, and, the, karelo, finnish, soviet, socialist, republic, was, established, by, merging, the, ceded, territories, with, the, kassr, after, a, june, 1940, soviet, ultimatum, demanding, bessarabia, bukovina, and, the, hertsa, region, from, romania, the, soviets, entered, these, areas, romania, caved, to, soviet, demands, and, the, soviets, occupied, the, territories, in, june, 1941, germany, broke, the, molotov, ribbentrop, pact, by, invading, the, soviet, union, from, the, time, of, this, invasion, to, 1944, the, areas, annexed, by, the, soviet, union, were, part, of, germany, s, ostland, except, for, the, moldavian, ssr, thereafter, the, soviet, union, began, to, push, german, forces, westward, through, a, series, of, battles, on, the, eastern, front, in, the, aftermath, of, world, war, ii, on, the, soviet, finnish, border, the, parties, signed, another, peace, treaty, ceding, to, the, soviet, union, in, 1944, followed, by, a, soviet, annexation, of, roughly, the, same, eastern, finnish, territories, as, those, of, the, prior, interim, peace, treaty, as, part, of, the, karelo, finnish, soviet, socialist, republic, from, 1943, to, 1945, several, conferences, regarding, post, war, europe, occurred, that, in, part, addressed, the, potential, soviet, annexation, and, control, of, countries, in, central, europe, there, were, various, allied, plans, for, state, order, in, central, europe, for, post, war, while, joseph, stalin, tried, to, get, as, many, states, under, soviet, control, as, possible, british, prime, minister, winston, churchill, preferred, a, central, european, danube, confederation, to, counter, these, countries, against, germany, and, russia, churchill, s, soviet, policy, regarding, central, europe, differed, vastly, from, that, of, american, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, with, the, former, believing, soviet, leader, stalin, to, be, a, devil, like, tyrant, leading, a, vile, system, when, warned, of, potential, domination, by, a, stalin, dictatorship, over, part, of, europe, roosevelt, responded, with, a, statement, summarizing, his, rationale, for, relations, with, stalin, i, just, have, a, hunch, that, stalin, is, not, that, kind, of, a, man, i, think, that, if, i, give, him, everything, i, possibly, can, and, ask, for, nothing, from, him, in, return, noblesse, oblige, he, won, t, try, to, annex, anything, and, will, work, with, me, for, a, world, of, democracy, and, peace, while, meeting, with, stalin, and, roosevelt, in, tehran, in, 1943, churchill, stated, that, britain, was, vitally, interested, in, restoring, poland, as, a, politically, independent, country, britain, did, not, press, the, matter, for, fear, that, it, would, become, a, source, of, inter, allied, friction, in, february, 1945, at, the, conference, at, yalta, stalin, demanded, a, soviet, sphere, of, political, influence, in, central, europe, stalin, eventually, was, convinced, by, churchill, and, roosevelt, not, to, dismember, germany, stalin, stated, that, the, soviet, union, would, keep, the, territory, of, eastern, poland, they, had, already, taken, via, invasion, in, 1939, with, some, exceptions, and, wanted, a, pro, soviet, polish, government, in, power, in, what, would, remain, of, poland, after, resistance, by, churchill, and, roosevelt, stalin, promised, a, re, organization, of, the, current, pro, soviet, government, on, a, broader, democratic, basis, in, poland, he, stated, that, the, new, government, s, primary, task, would, be, to, prepare, elections, however, the, 1946, polish, people, s, referendum, known, as, the, three, times, yes, referendum, and, the, subsequent, 1947, polish, parliamentary, election, did, not, meet, democratic, standards, and, were, largely, manipulated, the, parties, at, yalta, further, agreed, that, the, countries, of, liberated, europe, and, former, axis, satellites, would, be, allowed, to, create, democratic, institutions, of, their, own, choice, pursuant, to, the, right, of, all, peoples, to, choose, the, form, of, government, under, which, they, will, live, the, parties, also, agreed, to, help, those, countries, form, interim, governments, pledged, to, the, earliest, possible, establishment, through, free, elections, and, facilitate, where, necessary, the, holding, of, such, elections, at, the, beginning, of, the, july, august, 1945, potsdam, conference, after, germany, s, unconditional, surrender, stalin, repeated, previous, promises, to, churchill, that, he, would, refrain, from, a, sovietization, of, central, europe, in, addition, to, reparations, stalin, pushed, for, war, booty, which, would, permit, the, soviet, union, to, directly, seize, property, from, conquered, nations, without, quantitative, or, qualitative, limitation, a, clause, was, added, permitting, this, to, occur, with, some, limitations, at, first, the, soviets, concealed, their, role, in, other, eastern, bloc, politics, with, the, transformation, appearing, as, a, modification, of, western, bourgeois, democracy, as, a, young, communist, was, told, in, east, germany, it, s, got, to, look, democratic, but, we, must, have, everything, in, our, control, stalin, felt, that, socioeconomic, transformation, was, indispensable, to, establish, soviet, control, reflecting, the, marxist, leninist, view, that, material, bases, the, distribution, of, the, means, of, production, shaped, social, and, political, relations, the, soviet, union, also, co, opted, the, eastern, european, countries, into, its, sphere, of, influence, by, making, reference, to, some, cultural, commonalities, moscow, trained, cadres, were, put, into, crucial, power, positions, to, fulfill, orders, regarding, sociopolitical, transformation, elimination, of, the, bourgeoisie, s, social, and, financial, power, by, expropriation, of, landed, and, industrial, property, was, accorded, absolute, priority, these, measures, were, publicly, billed, as, reforms, rather, than, socioeconomic, transformations, except, for, initially, in, czechoslovakia, activities, by, political, parties, had, to, adhere, to, bloc, politics, with, parties, eventually, having, to, accept, membership, in, an, antifascist, bloc, obliging, them, to, act, only, by, mutual, consensus, the, bloc, system, permitted, the, soviet, union, to, exercise, domestic, control, indirectly, crucial, departments, such, as, those, responsible, for, personnel, general, police, secret, police, and, youth, were, strictly, communist, run, moscow, cadres, distinguished, progressive, forces, from, reactionary, elements, and, rendered, both, powerless, such, procedures, were, repeated, until, communists, had, gained, unlimited, power, and, only, politicians, who, were, unconditionally, supportive, of, soviet, policy, remained, in, june, 1947, after, the, soviets, had, refused, to, negotiate, a, potential, lightening, of, restrictions, on, german, development, the, united, states, announced, the, marshall, plan, a, comprehensive, program, of, american, assistance, to, all, european, countries, wanting, to, participate, including, the, soviet, union, and, those, of, eastern, europe, the, soviets, rejected, the, plan, and, took, a, hard, line, position, against, the, united, states, and, non, communist, european, nations, however, czechoslovakia, was, eager, to, accept, the, us, aid, the, polish, government, had, a, similar, attitude, and, this, was, of, great, concern, to, the, soviets, in, one, of, the, clearest, signs, of, soviet, control, over, the, region, up, to, that, point, the, czechoslovakian, foreign, minister, jan, masaryk, was, summoned, to, moscow, and, berated, by, stalin, for, considering, joining, the, marshall, plan, polish, prime, minister, j, zef, cyrankiewicz, was, rewarded, for, the, polish, rejection, of, the, plan, with, a, huge, 5, year, trade, agreement, including, 450, million, in, credit, 200, 000, tons, of, grain, heavy, machinery, and, factories, in, july, 1947, stalin, ordered, these, countries, to, pull, out, of, the, paris, conference, on, the, european, recovery, programme, which, has, been, described, as, the, moment, of, truth, in, the, post, world, war, ii, division, of, europe, thereafter, stalin, sought, stronger, control, over, other, eastern, bloc, countries, abandoning, the, prior, appearance, of, democratic, institutions, when, it, appeared, that, in, spite, of, heavy, pressure, non, communist, parties, might, receive, in, excess, of, 40, of, the, vote, in, the, august, 1947, hungarian, elections, repressions, were, instituted, to, liquidate, any, independent, political, forces, in, that, same, month, annihilation, of, the, opposition, in, bulgaria, began, on, the, basis, of, continuing, instructions, by, soviet, cadres, at, a, late, september, 1947, meeting, of, all, communist, parties, in, szklarska, por, ba, eastern, bloc, communist, parties, were, blamed, for, permitting, even, minor, influence, by, non, communists, in, their, respective, countries, during, the, run, up, to, the, marshall, plan, in, the, former, german, capital, berlin, surrounded, by, soviet, occupied, germany, stalin, instituted, the, berlin, blockade, on, 24, june, 1948, preventing, food, materials, and, supplies, from, arriving, in, west, berlin, the, blockade, was, caused, in, part, by, early, local, elections, of, october, 1946, in, which, the, socialist, unity, party, of, germany, sed, was, rejected, in, favor, of, the, social, democratic, party, which, had, gained, two, and, a, half, times, more, votes, than, the, sed, the, united, states, britain, france, canada, australia, new, zealand, and, several, other, countries, began, a, massive, berlin, airlift, supplying, west, berlin, with, food, and, other, supplies, the, soviets, mounted, a, public, relations, campaign, against, the, western, policy, change, and, communists, attempted, to, disrupt, the, elections, of, 1948, preceding, large, losses, therein, while, 300, 000, berliners, demonstrated, and, urged, the, international, airlift, to, continue, in, may, 1949, stalin, lifted, the, blockade, permitting, the, resumption, of, western, shipments, to, berlin, after, disagreements, between, yugoslav, leader, josip, broz, tito, and, the, soviet, union, regarding, greece, and, albania, a, tito, stalin, split, occurred, followed, by, yugoslavia, being, expelled, from, the, cominform, in, june, 1948, and, a, brief, failed, soviet, putsch, in, belgrade, the, split, created, two, separate, communist, forces, in, europe, a, vehement, campaign, against, titoism, was, immediately, started, in, the, eastern, bloc, describing, agents, of, both, the, west, and, tito, in, all, places, as, engaging, in, subversive, activity, stalin, ordered, the, conversion, of, the, cominform, into, an, instrument, to, monitor, and, control, the, internal, affairs, of, other, eastern, bloc, parties, he, also, briefly, considered, converting, the, cominform, into, an, instrument, for, sentencing, high, ranking, deviators, but, dropped, the, idea, as, impractical, instead, a, move, to, weaken, communist, party, leaders, through, conflict, was, started, soviet, cadres, in, communist, party, and, state, positions, in, the, bloc, were, instructed, to, foster, intra, leadership, conflict, and, to, transmit, information, against, each, other, this, accompanied, a, continuous, stream, of, accusations, of, nationalistic, deviations, insufficient, appreciation, of, the, ussr, s, role, links, with, tito, and, espionage, for, yugoslavia, this, resulted, in, the, persecution, of, many, major, party, cadres, including, those, in, east, germany, the, first, country, to, experience, this, approach, was, albania, where, leader, enver, hoxha, immediately, changed, course, from, favoring, yugoslavia, to, opposing, it, in, poland, leader, w, adys, aw, gomu, ka, who, had, previously, made, pro, yugoslav, statements, was, deposed, as, party, secretary, general, in, early, september, 1948, and, subsequently, jailed, in, bulgaria, when, it, appeared, that, traicho, kostov, who, was, not, a, moscow, cadre, was, next, in, line, for, leadership, in, june, 1949, stalin, ordered, kostov, s, arrest, followed, soon, thereafter, by, a, death, sentence, and, execution, a, number, of, other, high, ranking, bulgarian, officials, were, also, jailed, stalin, and, hungarian, leader, m, ty, s, r, kosi, met, in, moscow, to, orchestrate, a, show, trial, of, r, kosi, opponent, l, szl, rajk, who, was, thereafter, executed, the, preservation, of, the, soviet, bloc, relied, on, maintaining, a, sense, of, ideological, unity, that, would, entrench, moscow, s, influence, in, eastern, europe, as, well, as, the, power, of, the, local, communist, elites, the, port, city, of, trieste, was, a, particular, focus, after, the, second, world, war, until, the, break, between, tito, and, stalin, the, western, powers, and, the, eastern, bloc, faced, each, other, uncompromisingly, the, neutral, buffer, state, free, territory, of, trieste, founded, in, 1947, with, the, united, nations, was, split, up, and, dissolved, in, 1954, and, 1975, also, because, of, the, d, tente, between, the, west, and, tito, despite, the, initial, institutional, design, of, communism, implemented, by, joseph, stalin, in, the, eastern, bloc, subsequent, development, varied, across, countries, in, satellite, states, after, peace, treaties, were, initially, concluded, opposition, was, essentially, liquidated, fundamental, steps, towards, socialism, were, enforced, and, kremlin, leaders, sought, to, strengthen, control, therein, right, from, the, beginning, stalin, directed, systems, that, rejected, western, institutional, characteristics, of, market, economies, capitalist, parliamentary, democracy, dubbed, bourgeois, democracy, in, soviet, parlance, and, the, rule, of, law, subduing, discretional, intervention, by, the, state, the, resulting, states, aspired, to, total, control, of, a, political, center, backed, by, an, extensive, and, active, repressive, apparatus, and, a, central, role, of, marxist, leninist, ideology, however, the, vestiges, of, democratic, institutions, were, never, entirely, destroyed, resulting, in, the, fa, ade, of, western, style, institutions, such, as, parliaments, which, effectively, just, rubber, stamped, decisions, made, by, rulers, and, constitutions, to, which, adherence, by, authorities, was, limited, or, non, existent, parliaments, were, still, elected, but, their, meetings, occurred, only, a, few, days, per, year, only, to, legitimize, politburo, decisions, and, so, little, attention, was, paid, to, them, that, some, of, those, serving, were, actually, dead, and, officials, would, openly, state, that, they, would, seat, members, who, had, lost, elections, the, first, or, general, secretary, of, the, central, committee, in, each, communist, party, was, the, most, powerful, figure, in, each, regime, the, party, over, which, the, politburo, held, sway, was, not, a, mass, party, but, conforming, with, leninist, tradition, a, smaller, selective, party, of, between, three, and, fourteen, percent, of, the, country, s, population, who, had, accepted, total, obedience, those, who, secured, membership, in, this, selective, group, received, considerable, rewards, such, as, access, to, special, lower, priced, shops, with, a, greater, selection, of, high, quality, domestic, and, or, foreign, goods, confections, alcohol, cigars, cameras, televisions, and, the, like, special, schools, holiday, facilities, homes, high, quality, domestic, and, or, foreign, made, furniture, works, of, art, pensions, permission, to, travel, abroad, and, official, cars, with, distinct, license, plates, so, that, police, and, others, could, identify, these, members, from, a, distance, in, addition, to, emigration, restrictions, civil, society, defined, as, a, domain, of, political, action, outside, the, party, s, state, control, was, not, allowed, to, firmly, take, root, with, the, possible, exception, of, poland, in, the, 1980s, while, the, institutional, design, of, the, communist, systems, were, based, on, the, rejection, of, rule, of, law, the, legal, infrastructure, was, not, immune, to, change, reflecting, decaying, ideology, and, the, substitution, of, autonomous, law, initially, communist, parties, were, small, in, all, countries, except, czechoslovakia, such, that, there, existed, an, acute, shortage, of, politically, trustworthy, persons, for, administration, police, and, other, professions, thus, politically, unreliable, non, communists, initially, had, to, fill, such, roles, those, not, obedient, to, communist, authorities, were, ousted, while, moscow, cadres, started, a, large, scale, party, programs, to, train, personnel, who, would, meet, political, requirements, former, members, of, the, middle, class, were, officially, discriminated, against, though, the, state, s, need, for, their, skills, and, certain, opportunities, to, re, invent, themselves, as, good, communist, citizens, did, allow, many, to, nonetheless, achieve, success, communist, regimes, in, the, eastern, bloc, viewed, marginal, groups, of, opposition, intellectuals, as, a, potential, threat, because, of, the, bases, underlying, communist, power, therein, the, suppression, of, dissidence, and, opposition, was, considered, a, central, prerequisite, to, retain, power, though, the, enormous, expense, at, which, the, population, in, certain, countries, were, kept, under, secret, surveillance, may, not, have, been, rational, following, a, totalitarian, initial, phase, a, post, totalitarian, period, followed, the, death, of, stalin, in, which, the, primary, method, of, communist, rule, shifted, from, mass, terror, to, selective, repression, along, with, ideological, and, sociopolitical, strategies, of, legitimation, and, the, securing, of, loyalty, juries, were, replaced, by, a, tribunal, of, professional, judges, and, two, lay, assessors, that, were, dependable, party, actors, the, police, deterred, and, contained, opposition, to, party, directives, the, political, police, served, as, the, core, of, the, system, with, their, names, becoming, synonymous, with, raw, power, and, the, threat, of, violent, retribution, should, an, individual, become, active, against, the, state, several, state, police, and, secret, police, organizations, enforced, communist, party, rule, including, the, following, the, press, in, the, communist, period, was, an, organ, of, the, state, completely, reliant, on, and, subservient, to, the, communist, party, before, the, late, 1980s, eastern, bloc, radio, and, television, organizations, were, state, owned, while, print, media, was, usually, owned, by, political, organizations, mostly, by, the, local, communist, party, youth, newspapers, and, magazines, were, owned, by, youth, organizations, affiliated, with, communist, parties, the, control, of, the, media, was, exercised, directly, by, the, communist, party, itself, and, by, state, censorship, which, was, also, controlled, by, the, party, media, served, as, an, important,

alternative, concepts, and, critiques, several, state, communist, party, newspapers, were, published, including, the, telegraph, agency, of, the, soviet, union, tass, served, as, the, central, agency, for, collection, and, distribution, of, internal, and, international, news, for, all, soviet, newspapers, radio, and, television, stations, it, was, frequently, infiltrated, by, soviet, intelligence, and, security, agencies, such, as, the, nkvd, and, gru, tass, had, affiliates, in, 14, soviet, republics, including, the, lithuanian, ssr, latvian, ssr, estonian, ssr, moldavian, ssr, ukrainian, ssr,

eastern, bloc, despite, attempts, by, authorities, to, jam, the, airways, under, the, state, atheism, of, many, eastern, bloc, nations, religion, was, actively, suppressed, since, some, of, these, states, tied, their, ethnic, heritage, to, their, national, churches, both, the, peoples, and, their, churches, were, targeted, by, the, soviets, in, 1949, the, soviet, union, bulgaria, czechoslovakia, hungary, poland, and, romania, founded, the, comecon, in, accordance, with, stalin, s, desire, to, enforce, soviet, domination, of, the, lesser, states, of, central, europe, and, to, mollify, some, states, that, had, expressed, interest, in, the, marshall, plan, and, which, were, now, increasingly, cut, off, from, their, traditional, markets, and, suppliers, in, western, europe, the, comecon, s, role, became, ambiguous, because, stalin, preferred, more, direct, links, with, other, party, chiefs, than, the, comecon, s, indirect, sophistication, it, played, no, significant, role, in, the, 1950s, in, economic, planning, initially, the, comecon, served, as, cover, for, the, soviet, taking, of, materials, and, equipment, from, the, rest, of, the, eastern, bloc, but, the, balance, changed, when, the, soviets, became, net, subsidizers, of, the, rest, of, the, bloc, by, the, 1970s, via, an, exchange, of, low, cost, raw, materials, in, return, for, shoddily, manufactured, finished, goods, in, 1955, the, warsaw, pact, was, formed, partly, in, response, to, nato, s, inclusion, of, west, germany, and, partly, because, the, soviets, needed, an, excuse, to, retain, red, army, units, in, hungary, for, 35, years, the, pact, perpetuated, the, stalinist, concept, of, soviet, national, security, based, on, imperial, expansion, and, control, over, satellite, regimes, in, eastern, europe, this, soviet, formalization, of, their, security, relationships, in, the, eastern, bloc, reflected, moscow, s, basic, security, policy, principle, that, continued, presence, in, east, central, europe, was, a, foundation, of, its, defense, against, the, west, through, its, institutional, structures, the, pact, also, compensated, in, part, for, the, absence, of, joseph, stalin, s, personal, leadership, since, his, death, in, 1953, the, pact, consolidated, the, other, bloc, members, armies, in, which, soviet, officers, and, security, agents, served, under, a, unified, soviet, command, structure, beginning, in, 1964, romania, took, a, more, independent, course, while, it, did, not, repudiate, either, comecon, or, the, warsaw, pact, it, ceased, to, play, a, significant, role, in, either, nicolae, ceau, escu, s, assumption, of, leadership, one, year, later, pushed, romania, even, further, in, the, direction, of, separateness, albania, which, had, become, increasingly, isolated, under, stalinist, leader, enver, hoxha, following, de, stalinization, undergoing, an, albanian, soviet, split, in, 1961, withdrew, from, the, warsaw, pact, in, 1968, following, the, warsaw, pact, invasion, of, czechoslovakia, in, 1917, russia, restricted, emigration, by, instituting, passport, controls, and, forbidding, the, exit, of, belligerent, nationals, in, 1922, after, the, treaty, on, the, creation, of, the, ussr, both, the, ukrainian, ssr, and, the, russian, sfsr, issued, general, rules, for, travel, that, foreclosed, virtually, all, departures, making, legal, emigration, impossible, border, controls, thereafter, strengthened, such, that, by, 1928, even, illegal, departure, was, effectively, impossible, this, later, included, internal, passport, controls, which, when, combined, with, individual, city, propiska, place, of, residence, permits, and, internal, freedom, of, movement, restrictions, often, called, the, 101st, kilometre, greatly, restricted, mobility, within, even, small, areas, of, the, soviet, union, after, the, creation, of, the, eastern, bloc, emigration, out, of, the, newly, occupied, countries, except, under, limited, circumstances, was, effectively, halted, in, the, early, 1950s, with, the, soviet, approach, to, controlling, national, movement, emulated, by, most, of, the, rest, of, the, eastern, bloc, however, in, east, germany, taking, advantage, of, the, inner, german, border, between, occupied, zones, hundreds, of, thousands, fled, to, west, germany, with, figures, totaling, 197, 000, in, 1950, 165, 000, in, 1951, 182, 000, in, 1952, and, 331, 000, in, 1953, one, reason, for, the, sharp, 1953, increase, was, fear, of, potential, further, sovietization, with, the, increasingly, paranoid, actions, of, joseph, stalin, in, late, 1952, and, early, 1953, 226, 000, had, fled, in, just, the, first, six, months, of, 1953, with, the, closing, of, the, inner, german, border, officially, in, 1952, the, berlin, city, sector, borders, remained, considerably, more, accessible, than, the, rest, of, the, border, because, of, their, administration, by, all, four, occupying, powers, accordingly, it, effectively, comprised, a, loophole, through, which, eastern, bloc, citizens, could, still, move, west, the, 3, 5, million, east, germans, that, had, left, by, 1961, called, republikflucht, totaled, approximately, 20, of, the, entire, east, german, population, in, august, 1961, east, germany, erected, a, barbed, wire, barrier, that, would, eventually, be, expanded, through, construction, into, the, berlin, wall, effectively, closing, the, loophole, with, virtually, non, existent, conventional, emigration, more, than, 75, of, those, emigrating, from, eastern, bloc, countries, between, 1950, and, 1990, did, so, under, bilateral, agreements, for, ethnic, migration, about, 10, were, refugee, migrants, under, the, geneva, convention, of, 1951, most, soviets, allowed, to, leave, during, this, time, period, were, ethnic, jews, permitted, to, emigrate, to, israel, after, a, series, of, embarrassing, defections, in, 1970, caused, the, soviets, to, open, very, limited, ethnic, emigrations, the, fall, of, the, iron, curtain, was, accompanied, by, a, massive, rise, in, european, east, west, migration, famous, eastern, bloc, defectors, included, joseph, stalin, s, daughter, svetlana, alliluyeva, who, denounced, stalin, after, her, 1967, defection, eastern, bloc, countries, such, as, the, soviet, union, had, high, rates, of, population, growth, in, 1917, the, population, of, russia, in, its, present, borders, was, 91, million, despite, the, destruction, in, the, russian, civil, war, the, population, grew, to, 92, 7, million, in, 1926, in, 1939, the, population, increased, by, 17, percent, to, 108, million, despite, more, than, 20, million, deaths, suffered, throughout, world, war, ii, russia, s, population, grew, to, 117, 2, million, in, 1959, the, soviet, census, of, 1989, showed, russia, s, population, at, 147, million, people, the, soviet, economical, and, political, system, produced, further, consequences, such, as, for, example, in, baltic, states, where, the, population, was, approximately, half, of, what, it, should, have, been, compared, with, similar, countries, such, as, denmark, finland, and, norway, over, the, years, 1939, 1990, poor, housing, was, one, factor, leading, to, severely, declining, birth, rates, throughout, the, eastern, bloc, however, birth, rates, were, still, higher, than, in, western, european, countries, a, reliance, upon, abortion, in, part, because, periodic, shortages, of, birth, control, pills, and, intrauterine, devices, made, these, systems, unreliable, also, depressed, the, birth, rate, and, forced, a, shift, to, pro, natalist, policies, by, the, late, 1960s, including, severe, checks, on, abortion, and, propagandist, exhortations, like, the, heroine, mother, distinction, bestowed, on, those, romanian, women, who, bore, ten, or, more, children, in, october, 1966, artificial, birth, control, was, proscribed, in, romania, and, regular, pregnancy, tests, were, mandated, for, women, of, child, bearing, age, with, severe, penalties, for, anyone, who, was, found, to, have, terminated, a, pregnancy, despite, such, restrictions, birth, rates, continued, to, lag, in, part, because, of, unskilled, induced, abortions, the, populations, of, the, eastern, bloc, countries, were, as, follows, eastern, bloc, societies, operated, under, anti, meritocratic, principles, with, strong, egalitarian, elements, for, example, czechoslovakia, favoured, less, qualified, individuals, as, well, as, providing, privileges, for, the, nomenklatura, and, those, with, the, right, class, or, political, background, eastern, bloc, societies, were, dominated, by, the, ruling, communist, party, dubbed, partyocracy, by, pavel, machonin, former, members, of, the, middle, class, were, officially, discriminated, against, though, the, need, for, their, skills, allowed, them, to, re, invent, themselves, as, good, communist, citizens, a, housing, shortage, existed, throughout, the, eastern, bloc, in, europe, it, was, primarily, due, to, the, devastation, during, world, war, ii, construction, efforts, suffered, after, a, severe, cutback, in, state, resources, available, for, housing, starting, in, 1975, cities, became, filled, with, large, system, built, apartment, blocks, housing, construction, policy, suffered, from, considerable, organisational, problems, moreover, completed, houses, possessed, noticeably, poor, quality, finishes, the, near, total, emphasis, on, large, apartment, blocks, was, a, common, feature, of, eastern, bloc, cities, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, east, german, authorities, viewed, large, cost, advantages, in, the, construction, of, plattenbau, apartment, blocks, such, that, the, building, of, such, architecture, on, the, edge, of, large, cities, continued, until, the, dissolution, of, the, eastern, bloc, buildings, such, as, the, panel, ks, of, czechoslovakia, and, panelh, z, of, hungary, wishing, to, reinforce, the, role, of, the, state, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, nicolae, ceau, escu, enacted, the, systematisation, programme, which, consisted, of, the, demolition, and, reconstruction, of, existing, hamlets, villages, towns, and, cities, in, whole, or, in, part, in, order, to, make, place, to, standardised, apartment, blocks, across, the, country, blocuri, under, this, ideology, ceau, escu, built, centrul, civic, of, bucharest, in, the, 1980s, which, contains, the, palace, of, the, parliament, in, the, place, of, the, former, historic, center, even, by, the, late, 1980s, sanitary, conditions, in, most, eastern, bloc, countries, were, generally, far, from, adequate, for, all, countries, for, which, data, existed, 60, of, dwellings, had, a, density, of, greater, than, one, person, per, room, between, 1966, and, 1975, the, average, in, western, countries, for, which, data, was, available, approximated, 0, 5, persons, per, room, problems, were, aggravated, by, poor, quality, finishes, on, new, dwellings, often, causing, occupants, to, undergo, a, certain, amount, of, finishing, work, and, additional, repairs, the, worsening, shortages, of, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, occurred, during, an, increase, in, the, quantity, of, dwelling, stock, relative, to, population, from, 1970, to, 1986, even, for, new, dwellings, average, dwelling, size, was, only, 61, 3, square, metres, 660, sq, ft, in, the, eastern, bloc, compared, with, 113, 5, square, metres, 1, 222, sq, ft, in, ten, western, countries, for, which, comparable, data, was, available, space, standards, varied, considerably, with, the, average, new, dwelling, in, the, soviet, union, in, 1986, being, only, 68, the, size, of, its, equivalent, in, hungary, apart, from, exceptional, cases, such, as, east, germany, in, 1980, 1986, and, bulgaria, in, 1970, 1980, space, standards, in, newly, built, dwellings, rose, before, the, dissolution, of, the, eastern, bloc, housing, size, varied, considerably, across, time, especially, after, the, oil, crisis, in, the, eastern, bloc, for, instance, 1990, era, west, german, homes, had, an, average, floor, space, of, 83, square, metres, 890, sq, ft, compared, to, an, average, dwelling, size, in, the, gdr, of, 67, square, metres, 720, sq, ft, in, 1967, poor, housing, was, one, of, the, four, major, factors, others, being, poor, living, conditions, increased, female, employment, and, abortion, as, an, encouraged, means, of, birth, control, which, led, to, declining, birth, rates, throughout, the, eastern, bloc, because, of, the, lack, of, market, signals, eastern, bloc, economies, experienced, mis, development, by, central, planners, the, eastern, bloc, also, depended, upon, the, soviet, union, for, significant, amounts, of, materials, technological, backwardness, resulted, in, dependency, on, imports, from, western, countries, and, this, in, turn, in, demand, for, western, currency, eastern, bloc, countries, were, heavily, borrowing, from, club, de, paris, central, banks, and, london, club, private, banks, and, most, of, them, by, the, early, 1980s, were, forced, to, notify, the, creditors, of, their, insolvency, this, information, was, however, kept, secret, from, the, citizens, and, propaganda, promoted, the, view, that, the, countries, were, on, the, best, way, to, socialism, as, a, consequence, of, world, war, ii, and, the, german, occupations, in, eastern, europe, much, of, the, region, had, been, subjected, to, enormous, destruction, of, industry, infrastructure, and, loss, of, civilian, life, in, poland, alone, the, policy, of, plunder, and, exploitation, inflicted, enormous, material, losses, to, polish, industry, 62, of, which, was, destroyed, agriculture, infrastructure, and, cultural, landmarks, the, cost, of, which, has, been, estimated, as, approximately, 525, billion, or, 640, billion, in, 2004, exchange, values, throughout, the, eastern, bloc, both, in, the, ussr, and, the, rest, of, the, bloc, russia, was, given, prominence, and, referred, to, as, the, naiboleye, vydayushchayasya, natsiya, the, most, prominent, nation, and, the, rukovodyashchiy, narod, the, leading, people, the, soviets, promoted, the, reverence, of, russian, actions, and, characteristics, and, the, construction, of, soviet, structural, hierarchies, in, the, other, countries, of, the, eastern, bloc, the, defining, characteristic, of, stalinist, totalitarianism, was, the, unique, symbiosis, of, the, state, with, society, and, the, economy, resulting, in, politics, and, economics, losing, their, distinctive, features, as, autonomous, and, distinguishable, spheres, initially, stalin, directed, systems, that, rejected, western, institutional, characteristics, of, market, economies, democratic, governance, dubbed, bourgeois, democracy, in, soviet, parlance, and, the, rule, of, law, subduing, discretional, intervention, by, the, state, the, soviets, mandated, expropriation, and, etatisation, of, private, property, the, soviet, style, replica, regimes, that, arose, in, the, bloc, not, only, reproduced, the, soviet, command, economy, but, also, adopted, the, brutal, methods, employed, by, joseph, stalin, and, soviet, style, secret, polices, to, suppress, real, and, potential, opposition, stalinist, regimes, in, the, eastern, bloc, saw, even, marginal, groups, of, opposition, intellectuals, as, a, potential, threat, because, of, the, bases, underlying, stalinist, power, therein, the, suppression, of, dissent, and, opposition, was, a, central, prerequisite, for, the, security, of, stalinist, power, within, the, eastern, bloc, though, the, degree, of, opposition, and, dissident, suppression, varied, by, country, and, time, throughout, the, eastern, bloc, in, addition, media, in, the, eastern, bloc, were, organs, of, the, state, completely, reliant, on, and, subservient, to, the, government, of, the, ussr, with, radio, and, television, organisations, being, state, owned, while, print, media, was, usually, owned, by, political, organisations, mostly, by, the, local, party, while, over, 15, million, eastern, bloc, residents, migrated, westward, from, 1945, to, 1949, emigration, was, effectively, halted, in, the, early, 1950s, with, the, soviet, approach, to, controlling, national, movement, emulated, by, most, of, the, rest, of, the, eastern, bloc, in, the, ussr, because, of, strict, soviet, secrecy, under, joseph, stalin, for, many, years, after, world, war, ii, even, the, best, informed, foreigners, did, not, effectively, know, about, the, operations, of, the, soviet, economy, stalin, had, sealed, off, outside, access, to, the, soviet, union, since, 1935, and, until, his, death, effectively, permitting, no, foreign, travel, inside, the, soviet, union, such, that, outsiders, did, not, know, of, the, political, processes, that, had, taken, place, therein, during, this, period, and, even, for, 25, years, after, stalin, s, death, the, few, diplomats, and, foreign, correspondents, permitted, inside, the, soviet, union, were, usually, restricted, to, within, a, few, kilometres, of, moscow, their, phones, were, tapped, their, residences, were, restricted, to, foreigner, only, locations, and, they, were, constantly, followed, by, soviet, authorities, the, soviets, also, modeled, economies, in, the, rest, of, eastern, bloc, outside, the, soviet, union, along, soviet, command, economy, lines, before, world, war, ii, the, soviet, union, used, draconian, procedures, to, ensure, compliance, with, directives, to, invest, all, assets, in, state, planned, manners, including, the, collectivisation, of, agriculture, and, utilising, a, sizeable, labor, army, collected, in, the, gulag, system, this, system, was, largely, imposed, on, other, eastern, bloc, countries, after, world, war, ii, while, propaganda, of, proletarian, improvements, accompanied, systemic, changes, terror, and, intimidation, of, the, consequent, ruthless, stalinism, obfuscated, feelings, of, any, purported, benefits, stalin, felt, that, socioeconomic, transformation, was, indispensable, to, establish, soviet, control, reflecting, the, marxist, leninist, view, that, material, bases, the, distribution, of, the, means, of, production, shaped, social, and, political, relations, moscow, trained, cadres, were, put, into, crucial, power, positions, to, fulfill, orders, regarding, sociopolitical, transformation, elimination, of, the, bourgeoisie, s, social, and, financial, power, by, expropriation, of, landed, and, industrial, property, was, accorded, absolute, priority, these, measures, were, publicly, billed, as, reforms, rather, than, socioeconomic, transformations, throughout, the, eastern, bloc, except, for, czechoslovakia, societal, organisations, such, as, trade, unions, and, associations, representing, various, social, professional, and, other, groups, were, erected, with, only, one, organisation, for, each, category, with, competition, excluded, those, organisations, were, managed, by, stalinist, cadres, though, during, the, initial, period, they, allowed, for, some, diversity, at, the, same, time, at, the, war, s, end, the, soviet, union, adopted, a, plunder, policy, of, physically, transporting, and, relocating, east, european, industrial, assets, to, the, soviet, union, eastern, bloc, states, were, required, to, provide, coal, industrial, equipment, technology, rolling, stock, and, other, resources, to, reconstruct, the, soviet, union, between, 1945, and, 1953, the, soviets, received, a, net, transfer, of, resources, from, the, rest, of, the, eastern, bloc, under, this, policy, of, roughly, 14, billion, an, amount, comparable, to, the, net, transfer, from, the, united, states, to, western, europe, in, the, marshall, plan, reparations, included, the, dismantling, of, railways, in, poland, and, romanian, reparations, to, the, soviets, between, 1944, and, 1948, valued, at, 1, 8, billion, concurrent, with, the, domination, of, sovroms, in, addition, the, soviets, re, organised, enterprises, as, joint, stock, companies, in, which, the, soviets, possessed, the, controlling, interest, using, that, control, vehicle, several, enterprises, were, required, to, sell, products, at, below, world, prices, to, the, soviets, such, as, uranium, mines, in, czechoslovakia, and, east, germany, coal, mines, in, poland, and, oil, wells, in, romania, the, trading, pattern, of, the, eastern, bloc, countries, was, severely, modified, before, world, war, ii, no, greater, than, 1, 2, of, those, countries, trade, was, with, the, soviet, union, by, 1953, the, share, of, such, trade, had, jumped, to, 37, in, 1947, joseph, stalin, had, also, denounced, the, marshall, plan, and, forbade, all, eastern, bloc, countries, from, participating, in, it, soviet, dominance, further, tied, other, eastern, bloc, economies, to, moscow, via, the, council, for, mutual, economic, assistance, cmea, or, comecon, which, determined, countries, investment, allocations, and, the, products, that, would, be, traded, within, eastern, bloc, although, comecon, was, initiated, in, 1949, its, role, became, ambiguous, because, stalin, preferred, more, direct, links, with, other, party, chiefs, than, the, indirect, sophistication, of, the, council, it, played, no, significant, role, in, the, 1950s, in, economic, planning, initially, comecon, served, as, cover, for, the, soviet, taking, of, materials, and, equipment, from, the, rest, of, the, eastern, bloc, but, the, balance, changed, when, the, soviets, became, net, subsidisers, of, the, rest, of, the, bloc, by, the, 1970s, via, an, exchange, of, low, cost, raw, materials, in, return, for, shoddily, manufactured, finished, goods, while, resources, such, as, oil, timber, and, uranium, initially, made, gaining, access, to, other, eastern, bloc, economies, attractive, the, soviets, soon, had, to, export, soviet, raw, materials, to, those, countries, to, maintain, cohesion, therein, following, resistance, to, comecon, plans, to, extract, romania, s, mineral, resources, and, heavily, utilise, its, agricultural, production, romania, began, to, take, a, more, independent, stance, in, 1964, while, it, did, not, repudiate, comecon, it, took, no, significant, role, in, its, operation, especially, after, the, rise, to, power, of, nicolae, ceau, escu, according, to, the, official, propaganda, in, the, soviet, union, there, was, unprecedented, affordability, of, housing, health, care, and, education, apartment, rent, on, average, amounted, to, only, 1, percent, of, the, family, budget, a, figure, which, reached, 4, percent, when, municipal, services, are, factored, in, tram, tickets, were, 20, kopecks, and, a, loaf, of, bread, was, 15, kopecks, the, average, monthly, salary, of, an, engineer, was, 140, 160, rubles, the, soviet, union, made, major, progress, in, developing, the, country, s, consumer, goods, sector, in, 1970, the, ussr, produced, 679, million, pairs, of, leather, footwear, compared, to, 534, million, for, the, united, states, czechoslovakia, which, had, the, world, s, highest, per, capita, production, of, shoes, exported, a, significant, portion, of, its, shoe, production, to, other, countries, the, rising, standard, of, living, under, socialism, led, to, a, steady, decrease, in, the, workday, and, an, increase, in, leisure, in, 1974, the, average, workweek, for, soviet, industrial, workers, was, 40, hours, paid, vacations, in, 1968, reached, a, minimum, of, 15, workdays, in, the, mid, 1970s, the, number, of, free, days, per, year, days, off, holidays, and, vacations, was, 128, 130, almost, double, the, figure, from, the, previous, ten, years, because, of, the, lack, of, market, signals, in, such, economies, they, experienced, mis, development, by, central, planners, resulting, in, those, countries, following, a, path, of, extensive, large, mobilisation, of, inefficiently, used, capital, labor, energy, and, raw, material, inputs, rather, than, intensive, efficient, resource, use, development, to, attempt, to, achieve, quick, growth, the, eastern, bloc, countries, were, required, to, follow, the, soviet, model, overemphasising, heavy, industry, at, the, expense, of, light, industry, and, other, sectors, since, that, model, involved, the, prodigal, exploitation, of, natural, and, other, resources, it, has, been, described, as, a, kind, of, slash, and, burn, modality, while, the, soviet, system, strove, for, a, dictatorship, of, the, proletariat, there, was, little, existing, proletariat, in, many, eastern, european, countries, such, that, to, create, one, heavy, industry, needed, to, be, built, each, system, shared, the, distinctive, themes, of, state, oriented, economies, including, poorly, defined, property, rights, a, lack, of, market, clearing, prices, and, overblown, or, distorted, productive, capacities, in, relation, to, analogous, market, economies, major, errors, and, waste, occurred, in, the, resource, allocation, and, distribution, systems, because, of, the, party, run, monolithic, state, organs, these, systems, provided, no, effective, mechanisms, or, incentives, to, control, costs, profligacy, inefficiency, and, waste, heavy, industry, was, given, priority, because, of, its, importance, for, the, military, industrial, establishment, and, for, the, engineering, sector, factories, were, sometimes, inefficiently, located, incurring, high, transport, costs, while, poor, plant, organisation, sometimes, resulted, in, production, hold, ups, and, knock, on, effects, in, other, industries, dependent, on, monopoly, suppliers, of, intermediates, for, example, each, country, including, albania, built, steel, mills, regardless, of, whether, they, lacked, the, requisite, resource, of, energy, and, mineral, ores, a, massive, metallurgical, plant, was, built, in, bulgaria, despite, the, fact, that, its, ores, had, to, be, imported, from, the, soviet, union, and, transported, 320, kilometres, 200, mi, from, the, port, at, burgas, a, warsaw, tractor, factory, in, 1980, had, a, 52, page, list, of, unused, rusting, then, useless, equipment, this, emphasis, on, heavy, industry, diverted, investment, from, the, more, practical, production, of, chemicals, and, plastics, in, addition, the, plans, emphasis, on, quantity, rather, than, quality, made, eastern, bloc, products, less, competitive, in, the, world, market, high, costs, passed, through, the, product, chain, boosted, the, value, of, production, on, which, wage, increases, were, based, but, made, exports, less, competitive, planners, rarely, closed, old, factories, even, when, new, capacities, opened, elsewhere, for, example, the, polish, steel, industry, retained, a, plant, in, upper, silesia, despite, the, opening, of, modern, integrated, units, on, the, periphery, while, the, last, old, siemens, martin, process, furnace, installed, in, the, 19th, century, was, not, closed, down, immediately, producer, goods, were, favoured, over, consumer, goods, causing, consumer, goods, to, be, lacking, in, quantity, and, quality, in, the, shortage, economies, that, resulted, by, the, mid, 1970s, budget, deficits, rose, considerably, and, domestic, prices, widely, diverged, from, the, world, prices, while, production, prices, averaged, 2, higher, than, consumer, prices, many, premium, goods, could, be, bought, either, in, a, black, market, or, only, in, special, stores, using, foreign, currency, generally, inaccessible, to, most, eastern, bloc, citizens, such, as, intershop, in, east, germany, beryozka, in, the, soviet, union, pewex, in, poland, tuzex, in, czechoslovakia, corecom, in, bulgaria, or, comturist, in, romania, much, of, what, was, produced, for, the, local, population, never, reached, its, intended, user, while, many, perishable, products, became, unfit, for, consumption, before, reaching, their, consumers, as, a, result, of, the, deficiencies, of, the, official, economy, black, markets, were, created, that, were, often, supplied, by, goods, stolen, from, the, public, sector, the, second, parallel, economy, flourished, throughout, the, bloc, because, of, rising, unmet, state, consumer, needs, black, and, gray, markets, for, foodstuffs, goods, and, cash, arose, goods, included, household, goods, medical, supplies, clothes, furniture, cosmetics, and, toiletries, in, chronically, short, supply, through, official, outlets, many, farmers, concealed, actual, output, from, purchasing, agencies, to, sell, it, illicitly, to, urban, consumers, hard, foreign, currencies, were, highly, sought, after, while, highly, valued, western, items, functioned, as, a, medium, of, exchange, or, bribery, in, stalinist, countries, such, as, in, romania, where, kent, cigarettes, served, as, an, unofficial, extensively, used, currency, to, buy, goods, and, services, some, service, workers, moonlighted, illegally, providing, services, directly, to, customers, for, payment, the, extensive, production, industrialization, that, resulted, was, not, responsive, to, consumer, needs, and, caused, a, neglect, in, the, service, sector, unprecedented, rapid, urbanization, acute, urban, overcrowding, chronic, shortages, and, massive, recruitment, of, women, into, mostly, menial, and, or, low, paid, occupations, the, consequent, strains, resulted, in, the, widespread, used, of, coercion, repression, show, trials, purges, and, intimidation, by, 1960, massive, urbanisation, occurred, in, poland, 48, urban, and, bulgaria, 38, which, increased, employment, for, peasants, but, also, caused, illiteracy, to, skyrocket, when, children, left, school, for, work, cities, became, massive, building, sites, resulting, in, the, reconstruction, of, some, war, torn, buildings, but, also, the, construction, of, drab, dilapidated, system, built, apartment, blocks, urban, living, standards, plummeted, because, resources, were, tied, up, in, huge, long, term, building, projects, while, industrialization, forced, millions, of, former, peasants, to, live, in, hut, camps, or, grim, apartment, blocks, close, to, massive, polluting, industrial, complexes, collectivization, is, a, process, pioneered, by, joseph, stalin, in, the, late, 1920s, by, which, marxist, leninist, regimes, in, the, eastern, bloc, and, elsewhere, attempted, to, establish, an, ordered, socialist, system, in, rural, agriculture, it, required, the, forced, consolidation, of, small, scale, peasant, farms, and, larger, holdings, belonging, to, the, landed, classes, for, the, purpose, of, creating, larger, modern, collective, farms, owned, in, theory, by, the, workers, therein, in, reality, such, farms, were, owned, by, the, state, in, addition, to, eradicating, the, perceived, inefficiencies, associated, with, small, scale, farming, on, discontiguous, land, holdings, collectivization, also, purported, to, achieve, the, political, goal, of, removing, the, rural, basis, for, resistance, to, stalinist, regimes, a, further, justification, given, was, the, need, to, promote, industrial, development, by, facilitating, the, state, s, procurement, of, agricultural, products, and, transferring, surplus, labor, from, rural, to, urban, areas, in, short, agriculture, was, reorganized, in, order, to, proletarianize, the, peasantry, and, control, production, at, prices, determined, by, the, state, the, eastern, bloc, possesses, substantial, agricultural, resources, especially, in, southern, areas, such, as, hungary, s, great, plain, which, offered, good, soils, and, a, warm, climate, during, the, growing, season, rural, collectivization, proceeded, differently, in, non, soviet, eastern, bloc, countries, than, it, did, in, the, soviet, union, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, because, of, the, need, to, conceal, the, assumption, of, control, and, the, realities, of, an, initial, lack, of, control, no, soviet, dekulakisation, style, liquidation, of, rich, peasants, could, be, carried, out, in, the, non, soviet, eastern, bloc, countries, nor, could, they, risk, mass, starvation, or, agricultural, sabotage, e, g, holodomor, with, a, rapid, collectivization, through, massive, state, farms, and, agricultural, producers, cooperatives, apcs, instead, collectivization, proceeded, more, slowly, and, in, stages, from, 1948, to, 1960, in, bulgaria, romania, hungary, czechoslovakia, and, east, germany, and, from, 1955, to, 1964, in, albania, collectivization, in, the, baltic, republics, of, the, lithuanian, ssr, estonian, ssr, and, latvian, ssr, took, place, between, 1947, and, 1952, unlike, soviet, collectivization, neither, massive, destruction, of, livestock, nor, errors, causing, distorted, output, or, distribution, occurred, in, the, other, eastern, bloc, countries, more, widespread, use, of, transitional, forms, occurred, with, differential, compensation, payments, for, peasants, that, contributed, more, land, to, apcs, because, czechoslovakia, and, east, germany, were, more, industrialized, than, the, soviet, union, they, were, in, a, position, to, furnish, most, of, the, equipment, and, fertilizer, inputs, needed, to, ease, the, transition, to, collectivized, agriculture, instead, of, liquidating, large, farmers, or, barring, them, from, joining, apcs, as, stalin, had, done, through, dekulakisation, those, farmers, were, utilised, in, the, non, soviet, eastern, bloc, collectivizations, sometimes, even, being, named, farm, chairman, or, managers, collectivisation, often, met, with, strong, rural, resistance, including, peasants, frequently, destroying, property, rather, than, surrendering, it, to, the, collectives, strong, peasant, links, with, the, land, through, private, ownership, were, broken, and, many, young, people, left, for, careers, in, industry, in, poland, and, yugoslavia, fierce, resistance, from, peasants, many, of, whom, had, resisted, the, axis, led, to, the, abandonment, of, wholesale, rural, collectivisation, in, the, early, 1950s, in, part, because, of, the, problems, created, by, collectivisation, agriculture, was, largely, de, collectivised, in, poland, in, 1957, the, fact, that, poland, nevertheless, managed, to, carry, out, large, scale, centrally, planned, industrialisation, with, no, more, difficulty, than, its, collectivised, eastern, bloc, neighbours, further, called, into, question, the, need, for, collectivisation, in, such, planned, economies, only, poland, s, western, territories, those, eastwardly, adjacent, to, the, oder, neisse, line, that, were, annexed, from, germany, were, substantially, collectivised, largely, in, order, to, settle, large, numbers, of, poles, on, good, farmland, which, had, been, taken, from, german, farmers, there, was, significant, progress, made, in, the, economy, in, countries, such, as, the, soviet, union, in, 1980, the, soviet, union, took, first, place, in, europe, and, second, worldwide, in, terms, of, industrial, and, agricultural, production, respectively, in, 1960, the, ussr, s, industrial, output, was, only, 55, that, of, america, but, this, increased, to, 80, in, 1980, with, the, change, of, the, soviet, leadership, in, 1964, there, were, significant, changes, made, to, economic, policy, the, government, on, 30, september, 1965, issued, a, decree, on, improving, the, management, of, industry, and, the, 4, october, 1965, resolution, on, improving, and, strengthening, the, economic, incentives, for, industrial, production, the, main, initiator, of, these, reforms, was, premier, a, kosygin, kosygin, s, reforms, on, agriculture, gave, considerable, autonomy, to, the, collective, farms, giving, them, the, right, to, the, contents, of, private, farming, during, this, period, there, was, the, large, scale, land, reclamation, program, the, construction, of, irrigation, channels, and, other, measures, in, the, period, 1966, 1970, the, gross, national, product, grew, by, over, 35, industrial, output, increased, by, 48, and, agriculture, by, 17, in, the, eighth, five, year, plan, the, national, income,

momentum, for, this, waned, in, the, 1980s, when, no, long, term, plan, arose, to, procure, improvements, in, the, tourist, environment, such, as, an, assurance, of, freedom, of, movement, free, and, efficient, money, exchange, and, the, provision, of, higher, quality, products, with, which, these, tourists, were, familiar, however, western, tourists, were, generally, free, to, move, about, in, hungary, poland, and, yugoslavia, and, go, where, they, wished, it, was, more, difficult, or, even, impossible, to, go, as, an, individual, tourist, to, east, germany, czechoslovakia, romania, bulgaria, and, albania, it, was, generally, possible, in, all, cases, for, relatives, from, the, west, to, visit, and, stay, with, family, in, the, eastern, bloc, countries, except, for, albania, in, these, cases, permission, had, to, be, sought, precise, times, length, of, stay, location, and, movements, had, to, be, known, in, advance, catering, to, western, visitors, required, creating, an, environment, of, an, entirely, different, standard, than, that, used, for, the, domestic, populace, which, required, concentration, of, travel, spots, including, the, building, of, relatively, high, quality, infrastructure, in, travel, complexes, which, could, not, easily, be, replicated, elsewhere, because, of, a, desire, to, preserve, ideological, discipline, and, the, fear, of, the, presence, of, wealthier, foreigners, engaging, in, differing, lifestyles, albania, segregated, travelers, because, of, the, worry, of, the, subversive, effect, of, the, tourist, industry, travel, was, restricted, to, 6, 000, visitors, per, year, growth, rates, in, the, eastern, bloc, were, initially, high, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, during, this, first, period, progress, was, rapid, by, european, standards, and, per, capita, growth, within, the, eastern, bloc, increased, by, 2, 4, times, the, european, average, eastern, europe, accounted, for, 12, 3, percent, of, european, production, in, 1950, but, 14, 4, in, 1970, however, the, system, was, resistant, to, change, and, did, not, easily, adapt, to, new, conditions, for, political, reasons, old, factories, were, rarely, closed, even, when, new, technologies, became, available, as, a, result, after, the, 1970s, growth, rates, within, the, bloc, experienced, relative, decline, meanwhile, west, germany, austria, france, and, other, western, european, nations, experienced, increased, economic, growth, in, the, wirtschaftswunder, economic, miracle, trente, glorieuses, thirty, glorious, years, and, the, post, world, war, ii, boom, from, the, end, of, world, war, ii, to, the, mid, 1970s, the, economy, of, the, eastern, bloc, steadily, increased, at, the, same, rate, as, the, economy, in, western, europe, with, the, non, reformist, stalinist, nations, of, the, eastern, bloc, having, a, stronger, economy, than, the, reformist, stalinist, states, while, most, western, european, economies, essentially, began, to, approach, the, per, capita, gross, domestic, product, gdp, levels, of, the, united, states, during, the, late, 1970s, and, early, 1980s, the, eastern, bloc, countries, did, not, with, per, capita,

countries, of, the, eastern, bloc, as, well, as, those, of, western, europe, as, reported, by, the, conference, board, as, part, of, its, total, economy, database, in, some, cases, data, availability, does, not, go, all, the, way, back, to, 1951, the, united, nations, statistics, division, also, calculates, growth, rates, using, a, different, methodology, but, only, reports, the, figures, starting,

argued, the, world, bank, estimates, of, gdp, used, for, 1990, figures, underestimate, eastern, bloc, gdp, because, of, undervalued, local, currencies, per, capita, incomes, were, undoubtedly, lower, than, in, their, counterparts, east, germany, was, the, most, advanced, industrial, nation, of, the, eastern, bloc, until, the, building, of, the, berlin, wall, in, 1961, east, germany, was, considered, a, weak, state, hemorrhaging, skilled, labor, to, the, west, such, that, it, was, referred, to, as, the, disappearing, satellite, only, after, the, wall, sealed, in, skilled, labor, was, east, germany, able, to, ascend, to, the, top, economic, spot, in, the, eastern, bloc, thereafter, its, citizens, enjoyed, a, higher, quality, of, life, and, fewer, shortages, in, the, supply, of, goods, than, those, in, the, soviet, union, poland, or, romania, while, official, statistics, painted, a, relatively, rosy, picture, the, east, german, economy, had, eroded, because, of, increased, central, planning, economic, autarky, the, use, of, coal, over, oil, investment, concentration, in, a, few, selected, technology, intensive, areas, and, labor, market, regulation, as, a, result, a, large, productivity, gap, of, nearly, 50, per, worker, existed, between, east, and, west, germany, however, that, gap, does, not, measure, the, quality, of, design, of, goods, or, service, such, that, the, actual, per, capita, rate, may, be, as, low, as, 14, to, 20, per, cent, average, gross, monthly, wages, in, east, germany, were, around, 30, of, those, in, west, germany, though, after, accounting, for, taxation, the, figures, approached, 60, moreover, the, purchasing, power, of, wages, differed, greatly, with, only, about, half, of, east, german, households, owning, either, a, car, or, a, color, television, set, as, late, as, 1990, both, of, which, had, been, standard, possessions, in, west, german, households, the, ostmark, was, only, valid, for, transactions, inside, east,

reliable, management, and, the, prestige, value, placed, on, large, enterprises, performance, declined, during, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, due, to, inefficiency, when, industrial, input, costs, such, as, energy, prices, increased, though, growth, lagged, behind, the, west, it, did, occur, consumer, goods, started, to, become, more, available, by, the, 1960s, before, the, eastern, bloc, s, dissolution, some, major, sectors, of, industry, were, operating, at, such, a, loss, that, they, exported, products, to, the, west, at, prices, below, the, real, value, of, the, raw, materials, hungarian, steel, costs, doubled, those, of, western, europe, in, 1985, a, quarter, of, hungary, s, state, budget, was, spent, on, supporting, inefficient, enterprises, tight, planning, in, bulgaria, s, industry,

increase, in, housing, after, world, war, ii, housing, shortages, in, the, soviet, union, were, worse, than, in, the, rest, of, the, eastern, bloc, due, to, a, larger, migration, to, the, towns, and, more, wartime, devastation, and, were, worsened, by, stalin, s, pre, war, refusals, to, invest, properly, in, housing, because, such, investment, was, generally, not, enough, to, sustain, the, existing, population, apartments, had, to, be, subdivided, into, increasingly, smaller, units, resulting, in, several, families, sharing, an, apartment, previously, meant, for, one, family, the,

and, high, rise, housing, would, be, cheaper, and, quicker, than, traditional, brick, built, low, rise, housing, such, methods, required, manufacturing, organisations, to, produce, the, prefabricated,

of, participation, of, eventual, customers, the, residents, constituted, one, factor, in, escalating, construction, costs, and, poor, quality, work, this, led, to, higher, demolition, rates, and,
