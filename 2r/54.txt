the, territory, today, known, as, england, became, inhabited, more, than, 800, 000, years, ago, as, the, discovery, of, stone, tools, and, footprints, at, happisburgh, in, norfolk, have, indicated, the, earliest, evidence, for, early, modern, humans, in, northwestern, europe, a, jawbone, discovered, in, devon, at, kents, cavern, in, 1927, was, re, dated, in, 2011, to, between, 41, 000, and, 44, 000, years, old, continuous, human, habitation, in, england, dates, to, around, 13, 000, years, ago, see, creswellian, at, the, end, of, the, last, glacial, period, the, region, has, numerous, remains, from, the, mesolithic, neolithic, and, bronze, age, such, as, stonehenge, and, avebury, in, the, iron, age, all, of, britain, south, of, the, firth, of, forth, was, inhabited, by, the, celtic, people, known, as, the, britons, including, some, belgic, tribes, e, g, the, atrebates, the, catuvellauni, the, trinovantes, etc, in, the, south, east, in, ad, 43, the, roman, conquest, of, britain, began, the, romans, maintained, control, of, their, province, of, britannia, until, the, early, 5th, century, the, end, of, roman, rule, in, britain, facilitated, the, anglo, saxon, settlement, of, britain, which, historians, often, regard, as, the, origin, of, england, and, of, the, english, people, the, anglo, saxons, a, collection, of, various, germanic, peoples, established, several, kingdoms, that, became, the, primary, powers, in, present, day, england, and, parts, of, southern, scotland, they, introduced, the, old, english, language, which, largely, displaced, the, previous, brittonic, language, the, anglo, saxons, warred, with, british, successor, states, in, western, britain, and, the, hen, ogledd, old, north, the, brittonic, speaking, parts, of, northern, britain, as, well, as, with, each, other, raids, by, vikings, became, frequent, after, about, ad, 800, and, the, norsemen, settled, in, large, parts, of, what, is, now, england, during, this, period, several, rulers, attempted, to, unite, the, various, anglo, saxon, kingdoms, an, effort, that, led, to, the, emergence, of, the, kingdom, of, england, by, the, 10th, century, in, 1066, a, norman, expedition, invaded, and, conquered, england, the, norman, dynasty, established, by, william, the, conqueror, ruled, england, for, over, half, a, century, before, the, period, of, succession, crisis, known, as, the, anarchy, 1135, 1154, following, the, anarchy, england, came, under, the, rule, of, the, house, of, plantagenet, a, dynasty, which, later, inherited, claims, to, the, kingdom, of, france, during, this, period, magna, carta, was, signed, and, parliament, became, established, anti, semitism, rose, to, great, heights, and, in, 1290, england, became, the, first, country, to, permanently, expel, the, jews, 44, 45, 1, a, succession, crisis, in, france, led, to, the, hundred, years, war, 1337, 1453, a, series, of, conflicts, involving, the, peoples, of, both, nations, following, the, hundred, years, wars, england, became, embroiled, in, its, own, succession, wars, the, wars, of, the, roses, pitted, two, branches, of, the, house, of, plantagenet, against, one, another, the, house, of, york, and, the, house, of, lancaster, the, lancastrian, henry, tudor, ended, the, war, of, the, roses, and, established, the, tudor, dynasty, in, 1485, under, the, tudors, and, the, later, stuart, dynasty, england, became, a, colonial, power, during, the, rule, of, the, stuarts, the, english, civil, war, took, place, between, the, parliamentarians, and, the, royalists, which, resulted, in, the, execution, of, king, charles, i, 1649, and, the, establishment, of, a, series, of, republican, governments, first, a, parliamentary, republic, known, as, the, commonwealth, of, england, 1649, 1653, then, a, military, dictatorship, under, oliver, cromwell, known, as, the, protectorate, 1653, 1659, the, stuarts, returned, to, the, restored, throne, in, 1660, though, continued, questions, over, religion, and, power, resulted, in, the, deposition, of, another, stuart, king, james, ii, in, the, glorious, revolution, 1688, england, which, had, subsumed, wales, in, the, 16th, century, under, henry, viii, united, with, scotland, in, 1707, to, form, a, new, sovereign, state, called, great, britain, following, the, industrial, revolution, which, started, in, england, great, britain, ruled, a, colonial, empire, the, largest, in, recorded, history, following, a, process, of, decolonisation, in, the, 20th, century, mainly, caused, by, the, weakening, of, great, britain, s, power, in, the, two, world, wars, almost, all, of, the, empire, s, overseas, territories, became, independent, countries, the, time, from, britain, s, first, inhabitation, until, the, last, glacial, maximum, is, known, as, the, old, stone, age, or, palaeolithic, era, archaeological, evidence, indicates, that, what, was, to, become, england, was, colonised, by, humans, long, before, the, rest, of, the, british, isles, because, of, its, more, hospitable, climate, between, and, during, the, various, glacial, periods, of, the, distant, past, this, earliest, evidence, from, happisburgh, in, norfolk, includes, the, oldest, hominid, artefacts, found, in, britain, and, points, to, dates, of, more, than, 800, 000, rcybp, these, earliest, inhabitants, were, hunter, gatherers, low, sea, levels, meant, that, britain, was, attached, to, the, continent, for, much, of, this, earliest, period, of, history, and, varying, temperatures, over, tens, of, thousands, of, years, meant, that, it, was, not, always, inhabited, england, has, been, continuously, inhabited, since, the, last, ice, age, ended, around, 9000, bc, the, beginning, of, the, middle, stone, age, or, mesolithic, era, rising, sea, levels, cut, off, britain, from, the, continent, for, the, last, time, around, 6500, bc, the, population, by, then, as, in, the, rest, of, the, world, was, exclusively, anatomically, modern, humans, and, the, evidence, suggests, that, their, societies, were, increasingly, complex, and, they, were, manipulating, their, environment, and, prey, in, new, ways, possibly, selective, burning, of, then, omnipresent, woodland, to, create, clearings, for, herds, to, gather, and, then, hunt, them, hunting, was, mainly, done, with, simple, projectile, weapons, such, as, javelin, and, possibly, sling, bow, and, arrow, was, known, in, western, europe, since, at, least, 9000, bc, the, climate, continued, to, warm, and, the, population, probably, rose, the, new, stone, age, or, neolithic, era, began, with, the, introduction, of, farming, ultimately, from, the, middle, east, around, 4000, bc, it, is, not, known, whether, this, was, caused, by, a, substantial, folk, movement, or, native, adoption, of, foreign, practices, or, both, people, began, to, lead, a, more, settled, lifestyle, monumental, collective, tombs, were, built, for, the, dead, in, the, form, of, chambered, cairns, and, long, barrows, towards, the, end, of, the, period, other, kinds, of, monumental, stone, alignments, begin, to, appear, such, as, stonehenge, their, cosmic, alignments, show, a, preoccupation, with, the, sky, and, planets, flint, technology, produced, a, number, of, highly, artistic, pieces, as, well, as, purely, practical, more, extensive, woodland, clearance, was, done, for, fields, and, pastures, the, sweet, track, in, the, somerset, levels, is, one, of, the, oldest, timber, trackways, known, in, northern, europe, and, among, the, oldest, roads, in, the, world, dated, by, dendrochronology, to, the, winter, of, 3807, 3806, bc, it, is, thought, to, have, been, a, primarily, religious, structure, archaeological, evidence, from, north, yorkshire, indicates, that, salt, was, being, manufactured, there, in, the, neolithic, the, bronze, age, began, around, 2500, bc, with, the, appearance, of, bronze, objects, this, coincides, with, the, appearance, of, the, characteristic, bell, beaker, culture, following, migration, of, new, people, from, the, continent, according, to, olalde, et, al, 2018, after, 2500, bc, britain, s, neolithic, population, was, largely, replaced, by, this, new, bell, beaker, population, that, was, genetically, related, to, the, corded, ware, culture, of, central, and, eastern, europe, and, the, yamnaya, culture, of, the, eastern, european, pontic, caspian, steppe, while, the, migration, of, these, beaker, peoples, must, have, been, accompanied, by, a, language, shift, the, celtic, languages, were, probably, introduced, by, later, celtic, migrations, the, bronze, age, saw, a, shift, of, emphasis, from, the, communal, to, the, individual, and, the, rise, of, increasingly, powerful, elites, whose, power, came, from, their, prowess, as, hunters, and, warriors, and, their, controlling, the, flow, of, precious, resources, to, manipulate, tin, and, copper, into, high, status, bronze, objects, such, as, swords, and, axes, settlement, became, increasingly, permanent, and, intensive, towards, the, end, of, the, bronze, age, many, examples, of, very, fine, metalwork, began, to, be, deposited, in, rivers, presumably, for, ritual, reasons, and, perhaps, reflecting, a, progressive, change, in, emphasis, from, the, sky, to, the, earth, as, a, rising, population, put, increasing, pressure, on, the, land, england, largely, became, bound, up, with, the, atlantic, trade, system, which, created, a, cultural, continuum, over, a, large, part, of, western, europe, it, is, possible, that, the, celtic, languages, developed, or, spread, to, england, as, part, of, this, system, by, the, end, of, the, iron, age, there, is, much, evidence, that, they, were, spoken, across, all, england, and, western, parts, of, britain, the, iron, age, is, conventionally, said, to, begin, around, 800, bc, at, this, time, the, britons, or, celtic, britons, were, settled, in, england, the, celtic, people, of, early, england, were, the, majority, of, the, population, beside, other, smaller, ethnic, groups, in, great, britain, they, existed, like, this, from, the, british, iron, age, into, the, middle, ages, when, it, was, overtaken, by, germanic, anglo, saxons, after, some, time, the, celtic, britons, diverged, into, the, multiple, distinct, ethnic, groups, such, as, welsh, cornish, and, breton, but, they, were, still, tied, by, language, religion, and, culture, they, spoke, the, brittonic, language, a, celtic, language, which, is, the, ancestor, of, the, modern, brittonic, languages, the, atlantic, trade, system, had, by, this, time, effectively, collapsed, although, england, maintained, contacts, across, the, channel, with, france, as, the, hallstatt, culture, became, widespread, across, the, country, its, continuity, suggests, it, was, not, accompanied, by, substantial, movement, of, population, crucially, only, a, single, hallstatt, burial, is, known, from, britain, and, even, here, the, evidence, is, inconclusive, on, the, whole, burials, largely, disappear, across, england, and, the, dead, were, disposed, of, in, a, way, which, is, archaeologically, invisible, excarnation, is, a, widely, cited, possibility, hillforts, were, known, since, the, late, bronze, age, but, a, huge, number, were, constructed, during, 600, 400, bc, particularly, in, the, south, while, after, about, 400, bc, new, forts, were, rarely, built, and, many, ceased, to, be, regularly, inhabited, while, a, few, forts, become, more, and, more, intensively, occupied, suggesting, a, degree, of, regional, centralisation, around, this, time, the, earliest, mentions, of, britain, appear, in, the, annals, of, history, the, first, historical, mention, of, the, region, is, from, the, massaliote, periplus, a, sailing, manual, for, merchants, thought, to, date, to, the, 6th, century, bc, and, pytheas, of, massilia, wrote, of, his, voyage, of, discovery, to, the, island, around, 325, bc, both, of, these, texts, are, now, lost, although, quoted, by, later, writers, not, enough, survives, to, inform, the, archaeological, interpretation, to, any, significant, degree, britain, we, are, told, is, inhabited, by, tribes, which, are, autochthonous, and, preserve, in, their, ways, of, living, the, ancient, manner, of, life, they, use, chariots, for, instance, in, their, wars, even, as, tradition, tells, us, the, old, greek, heroes, did, in, the, trojan, war, contact, with, the, continent, was, less, than, in, the, bronze, age, but, still, significant, goods, continued, to, move, to, england, with, a, possible, hiatus, around, 350, to, 150, bc, there, were, a, few, armed, invasions, of, hordes, of, migrating, celts, there, are, two, known, invasions, around, 300, bc, a, group, from, the, gaulish, parisii, tribe, apparently, took, over, east, yorkshire, establishing, the, highly, distinctive, arras, culture, and, from, around, 150, 100, bc, groups, of, belgae, began, to, control, significant, parts, of, the, south, these, invasions, constituted, movements, of, a, few, people, who, established, themselves, as, a, warrior, elite, atop, existing, native, systems, rather, than, replacing, them, the, belgic, invasion, was, much, larger, than, the, parisian, settlement, but, the, continuity, of, pottery, style, shows, that, the, native, population, remained, in, place, yet, it, was, accompanied, by, significant, socio, economic, change, proto, urban, or, even, urban, settlements, known, as, oppida, begin, to, eclipse, the, old, hillforts, and, an, elite, whose, position, is, based, on, battle, prowess, and, the, ability, to, manipulate, resources, re, appears, much, more, distinctly, in, 55, and, 54, bc, julius, caesar, as, part, of, his, campaigns, in, gaul, invaded, britain, and, claimed, to, have, scored, a, number, of, victories, but, he, never, penetrated, further, than, hertfordshire, and, could, not, establish, a, province, however, his, invasions, mark, a, turning, point, in, british, history, control, of, trade, the, flow, of, resources, and, prestige, goods, became, ever, more, important, to, the, elites, of, southern, britain, rome, steadily, became, the, biggest, player, in, all, their, dealings, as, the, provider, of, great, wealth, and, patronage, in, retrospect, a, full, scale, invasion, and, annexation, was, inevitable, after, caesar, s, expeditions, the, romans, began, a, serious, and, sustained, attempt, to, conquer, britain, in, ad, 43, at, the, behest, of, emperor, claudius, they, landed, in, kent, with, four, legions, and, defeated, two, armies, led, by, the, kings, of, the, catuvellauni, tribe, caratacus, and, togodumnus, in, battles, at, the, medway, and, the, thames, togodumnus, was, killed, and, caratacus, fled, to, wales, the, roman, force, led, by, aulus, plautius, waited, for, claudius, to, come, and, lead, the, final, march, on, the, catuvellauni, capital, at, camulodunum, modern, colchester, before, he, returned, to, rome, for, his, triumph, the, catuvellauni, held, sway, over, most, of, the, southeastern, corner, of, england, eleven, local, rulers, surrendered, a, number, of, client, kingdoms, were, established, and, the, rest, became, a, roman, province, with, camulodunum, as, its, capital, over, the, next, four, years, the, territory, was, consolidated, and, the, future, emperor, vespasian, led, a, campaign, into, the, southwest, where, he, subjugated, two, more, tribes, by, ad, 54, the, border, had, been, pushed, back, to, the, severn, and, the, trent, and, campaigns, were, underway, to, subjugate, northern, england, and, wales, but, in, ad, 60, under, the, leadership, of, the, warrior, queen, boudicca, the, tribes, rebelled, against, the, romans, at, first, the, rebels, had, great, success, they, burned, camulodunum, londinium, and, verulamium, modern, day, colchester, london, and, st, albans, respectively, to, the, ground, there, is, some, archaeological, evidence, that, the, same, happened, at, winchester, the, second, legion, augusta, stationed, at, exeter, refused, to, move, for, fear, of, revolt, among, the, locals, londinium, governor, suetonius, paulinus, evacuated, the, city, before, the, rebels, sacked, and, burned, it, the, fire, was, so, hot, that, a, ten, inch, layer, of, melted, red, clay, remains, 15, feet, below, london, s, streets, in, the, end, the, rebels, were, said, to, have, killed, 70, 000, romans, and, roman, sympathisers, paulinus, gathered, what, was, left, of, the, roman, army, in, the, decisive, battle, 10, 000, romans, faced, nearly, 100, 000, warriors, somewhere, along, the, line, of, watling, street, at, the, end, of, which, boudicca, was, utterly, defeated, it, was, said, that, 80, 000, rebels, were, killed, but, only, 400, romans, over, the, next, 20, years, the, borders, expanded, slightly, but, the, governor, agricola, incorporated, into, the, province, the, last, pockets, of, independence, in, wales, and, northern, england, he, also, led, a, campaign, into, scotland, which, was, recalled, by, emperor, domitian, the, border, gradually, formed, along, the, stanegate, road, in, northern, england,

are, ubiquitous, throughout, england, in, the, wake, of, the, breakdown, of, roman, rule, in, britain, from, the, middle, of, the, fourth, century, present, day, england, was, progressively, settled, by, germanic, groups, collectively, known, as, the, anglo, saxons, these, included, angles, saxons, jutes, and, frisians, the, battle, of, deorham, was, critical, in, establishing, anglo, saxon, rule, in, 577, saxon, mercenaries, existed, in, britain, since, before, the, late, roman, period, but, the, main, influx, of, population, probably, happened, after, the, fifth, century, the, precise, nature, of, these, invasions, is, not, fully, known, there, are, doubts, about, the, legitimacy, of, historical, accounts, due, to, a, lack, of, archaeological, finds, gildas, de, excidio, et,

deira, other, smaller, kingdoms, seem, to, have, existed, as, well, such, as, lindsey, in, what, is, now, lincolnshire, and, the, hwicce, in, the, southwest, eventually, the, kingdoms, were, dominated, by, northumbria, and, mercia, in, the, 7th, century, mercia, in, the, 8th, century, and, then, wessex, in, the, 9th, century, northumbria, eventually, extended, its, control, north, into, scotland, and, west, into, wales, it, also, subdued, mercia, whose, first, powerful, king, penda, was, killed, by, oswy, in, 655, northumbria, s, power, began, to, wane, after, 685, with, the, defeat, and, death, of, its, king, aegfrith, at, the, hands, of, the, picts, mercian, power, reached, its, peak, under, the, rule, of, offa, who, from, 785, had, influence, over, most, of, anglo, saxon, england, since, offa, s, death, in, 796, the, supremacy, of, wessex, was, established, under, egbert, who, extended, control, west, into, cornwall, before, defeating, the, mercians, at, the, battle, of, ellendun, in, 825, four, years, later, he, received, submission, and, tribute, from, the, northumbrian, king, eanred, since, so, few, contemporary, sources, exist, the, events, of, the, fifth, and, sixth, centuries, are, difficult, to, ascertain, as, such, the, nature, of, the, anglo, saxon, settlements, is, debated, by, historians, archaeologists, and, linguists, the, traditional, view, that, the, anglo, saxons, drove, the, romano, british, inhabitants, out, of, what, is, now, england, was, subject, to, reappraisal, in, the, later, twentieth, century, one, suggestion, is, that, the, invaders, were, smaller, in, number, drawn, from, an, elite, class, of, male, warriors, that, gradually, acculturated, the, natives, an, emerging, view, is, that, the, scale, of, the, anglo, saxon, settlement, varied, across, england, and, that, as, such, it, cannot, be, described, by, any, one, process, in, particular, mass, migration, and, population, shift, seem, to, be, most, applicable, in, the, core, areas, of, settlement, such, as, east, anglia, and, lincolnshire, while, in, more, peripheral, areas, to, the, northwest, much, of, the, native, population, likely, remained, in, place, as, the, incomers, took, over, as, elites, in, a, study, of, place, names, in, northeastern, england, and, southern, scotland, bethany, fox, concluded, that, anglian, migrants, settled, in, large, numbers, in, river, valleys, such, as, those, of, the, tyne, and, the, tweed, with, the, britons, in, the, less, fertile, hill, country, becoming, acculturated, over, a, longer, period, fox, interprets, the, process, by, which, english, came, to, dominate, this, region, as, a, synthesis, of, mass, migration, and, elite, takeover, models, genetic, testing, has, been, used, to, find, evidence, of, large, scale, immigration, of, germanic, peoples, into, england, weale, et, al, 2002, found, that, english, y, dna, data, showed, signs, of, a, mass, anglo, saxon, immigration, from, the, european, continent, affecting, 50, 100, of, the, male, gene, pool, in, central, england, this, was, based, on, the, similarity, of, the, dna, collected, from, small, english, towns, to, that, found, in, friesland, a, 2003, study, with, samples, coming, from, larger, towns, found, a, large, variance, in, amounts, of, continental, germanic, ancestry, in, different, parts, of, england, in, the, study, such, markers, typically, ranged, from, 20, and, 45, in, southern, england, with, east, anglia, the, east, midlands, and, yorkshire, having, over, 50, north, german, and, danish, genetic, frequencies, were, indistinguishable, thus, precluding, any, ability, to, distinguish, between, the, genetic, influence, of, the, anglo, saxon, source, populations, and, the, later, and, better, documented, influx, of, danish, vikings, the, mean, value, of, continental, germanic, genetic, input, in, this, study, was, calculated, at, 54, per, cent, in, response, to, arguments, such, as, those, of, stephen, oppenheimer, and, bryan, sykes, that, the, similarity, between, english, and, continental, germanic, dna, could, have, originated, from, earlier, prehistoric, migrations, researchers, have, begun, to, use, data, collected, from, ancient, burials, to, ascertain, the, level, of, anglo, saxon, contribution, to, the, modern, english, gene, pool, two, studies, published, in, 2016, based, on, data, collected, from, skeletons, found, in, iron, age, roman, and, anglo, saxon, era, graves, in, cambridgeshire, and, yorkshire, concluded, that, the, ancestry, of, the, modern, english, population, contains, large, contributions, from, both, anglo, saxon, migrants, and, romano, british, natives, christianisation, of, anglo, saxon, england, began, around, 600, ad, influenced, by, celtic, christianity, from, the, northwest, and, the, roman, catholic, church, from, the, southeast, augustine, the, first, archbishop, of, canterbury, took, office, in, 597, in, 601, he, baptised,

dominance, over, much, of, britain, though, bede, s, northumbrian, bias, should, be, kept, in, mind, due, to, succession, crises, northumbrian, hegemony, was, not, constant, and, mercia, remained, a,

was, considered, the, overlord, of, south, britain, by, charlemagne, his, power, is, illustrated, by, the, fact, that, he, summoned, the, resources, to, build, offa, s, dyke, however, a, rising, wessex, and, challenges, from, smaller, kingdoms, kept, mercian, power, in, check, and, by, the, early, 9th, century, the, mercian, supremacy, was, over, this, period, has, been, described, as, the, heptarchy, though, this, term, has, now, fallen, out, of, academic, use, the, term, arose, because, the, seven, kingdoms, of, northumbria, mercia, kent, east, anglia, essex, sussex, and, wessex, were, the, main, polities, of, south, britain, other, small, kingdoms, were, also, politically, important, across, this, period, hwicce, magonsaete, lindsey, and, middle, anglia, the, first, recorded, landing, of, vikings, took, place, in, 787, in, dorsetshire, on, the, south, west, coast, the, first, major, attack, in, britain, was, in, 793, at, lindisfarne, monastery, as, given, by, the, anglo, saxon, chronicle, however, by, then, the, vikings, were, almost, certainly, well, established, in, orkney, and, shetland, and, many, other, non, recorded, raids, probably, occurred, before, this, records, do, show, the, first, viking, attack, on, iona, taking, place, in, 794, the, arrival, of, the, vikings, in, particular, the, danish, great, heathen, army, upset, the, political, and, social, geography, of, britain, and, ireland, in, 867, northumbria, fell, to, the, danes, east, anglia, fell, in, 869, though, wessex, managed, to, contain, the, vikings, by, defeating, them, at, ashdown, in, 871, a, second, invading, army, landed, leaving, the, saxons, on, a, defensive, footing, at, much, the, same, time, thelred, king, of, wessex, died, and, was, succeeded, by, his, younger, brother, alfred, alfred, was, immediately, confronted, with, the, task, of, defending, wessex, against, the, danes, he, spent, the, first, five, years, of, his, reign, paying, the, invaders, off, in, 878, alfred, s, forces, were, overwhelmed, at, chippenham, in, a, surprise, attack, it, was, only, now, with, the, independence, of, wessex, hanging, by, a, thread, that, alfred, emerged, as, a, great, king, in, may, 878, he, led, a, force, that, defeated, the, danes, at, edington, the, victory, was, so, complete, that, the, danish, leader, guthrum, was, forced, to, accept, christian, baptism, and, withdraw, from, mercia, alfred, then, set, about, strengthening, the, defences, of, wessex, building, a, new, navy, 60, vessels, strong, alfred, s, success, bought, wessex, and, mercia, years, of, peace, and, sparked, economic, recovery, in, previously, ravaged, areas, alfred, s, success, was, sustained, by, his, son, edward, whose, decisive, victories, over, the, danes, in, east, anglia, in, 910, and, 911, were, followed, by, a, crushing, victory, at, tempsford, in, 917, these, military, gains, allowed, edward, to, fully, incorporate, mercia, into, his, kingdom, and, add, east, anglia, to, his, conquests, edward, then, set, about, reinforcing, his, northern, borders, against, the, danish, kingdom, of, northumbria, edward, s, rapid, conquest, of, the, english, kingdoms, meant, wessex, received, homage, from, those, that, remained, including, gwynedd, in, wales, and, scotland, his, dominance, was, reinforced, by, his, son, thelstan, who, extended, the, borders, of, wessex, northward, in, 927, conquering, the, kingdom, of, york, and, leading, a, land, and, naval, invasion, of, scotland, these, conquests, led, to, his, adopting, the, title, king, of, the, english, for, the, first, time, the, dominance, and, independence, of, england, was, maintained, by, the, kings, that, followed, it, was, not, until, 978, and, the, accession, of, thelred, the, unready, that, the, danish, threat, resurfaced, two, powerful, danish, kings, harold, bluetooth, and, later, his, son, sweyn, both, launched, devastating, invasions, of, england, anglo, saxon, forces, were, resoundingly, defeated, at, maldon, in, 991, more, danish, attacks, followed, and, their, victories, were, frequent, thelred, s, control, over, his, nobles, began, to, falter, and, he, grew, increasingly, desperate, his, solution, was, to, pay, off, the, danes, for, almost, 20, years, he, paid, increasingly, large, sums, to, the, danish, nobles, to, keep, them, from, english, coasts, these, payments, known, as, danegelds, crippled, the, english, economy, thelred, then, made, an, alliance, with, normandy, in, 1001, through, marriage, to, the, duke, s, daughter, emma, in, the, hope, of, strengthening, england, then, he, made, a, great, error, in, 1002, he, ordered, the, massacre, of, all, the, danes, in, england, in, response, sweyn, began, a, decade, of, devastating, attacks, on, england, northern, england, with, its, sizable, danish, population, sided, with, sweyn, by, 1013, london, oxford, and, winchester, had, fallen, to, the, danes, thelred, fled, to, normandy, and, sweyn, seized, the, throne, sweyn, suddenly, died, in, 1014, and, thelred, returned, to, england, confronted, by, sweyn, s, successor, cnut, however, in, 1016, thelred, also, suddenly, died, cnut, swiftly, defeated, the, remaining, saxons, killing, thelred, s, son, edmund, in, the, process, cnut, seized, the, throne, crowning, himself, king, of, england, alfred, of, wessex, died, in, 899, and, was, succeeded, by, his, son, edward, the, elder, edward, and, his, brother, in, law, thelred, of, what, was, left, of, mercia, began, a, programme, of, expansion, building, forts, and, towns, on, an, alfredian, model, on, thelred, s, death, his, wife, edward, s, sister, thelfl, d, ruled, as, lady, of, the, mercians, and, continued, expansion, it, seems, edward, had, his, son, thelstan, brought, up, in, the, mercian, court, on, edward, s, death, thelstan, succeeded, to, the, mercian, kingdom, and, after, some, uncertainty, wessex, thelstan, continued, the, expansion, of, his, father, and, aunt, and, was, the, first, king, to, achieve, direct, rulership, of, what, we, would, now, consider, england, the, titles, attributed, to, him, in, charters, and, on, coins, suggest, a, still, more, widespread, dominance, his, expansion, aroused, ill, feeling, among, the, other, kingdoms, of, britain, and, he, defeated, a, combined, scottish, viking, army, at, the, battle, of, brunanburh, however, the, unification, of, england, was, not, a, certainty, under, thelstan, s, successors, edmund, and, eadred, the, english, kings, repeatedly, lost, and, regained, control, of, northumbria, nevertheless, edgar, who, ruled, the, same, expanse, as, thelstan, consolidated, the, kingdom, which, remained, united, thereafter, there, were, renewed, scandinavian, attacks, on, england, at, the, end, of, the, 10th, century, thelred, ruled, a, long, reign, but, ultimately, lost, his, kingdom, to, sweyn, of, denmark, though, he, recovered, it, following, the, latter, s, death, however, thelred, s, son, edmund, ii, ironside, died, shortly, afterwards, allowing, cnut, sweyn, s, son, to, become, king, of, england, under, his, rule, the, kingdom, became, the, centre, of, government, for, the, north, sea, empire, which, included, denmark, and, norway, cnut, was, succeeded, by, his, sons, but, in, 1042, the, native, dynasty, was, restored, with, the, accession, of, edward, the, confessor, edward, s, failure, to, produce, an, heir, caused, a, furious, conflict, over, the, succession, on, his, death, in, 1066, his, struggles, for, power, against, godwin, earl, of, wessex, the, claims, of, cnut, s, scandinavian, successors, and, the, ambitions, of, the, normans, whom, edward, introduced, to, english, politics, to, bolster, his, own, position, caused, each, to, vie, for, control, of, edward, s, reign, harold, godwinson, became, king, probably, appointed, by, edward, on, his, deathbed, and, endorsed, by, the, witan, but, william, of, normandy, harald, hardr, de, aided, by, harold, godwin, s, estranged, brother, tostig, and, sweyn, ii, of, denmark, all, asserted, claims, to, the, throne, by, far, the, strongest, hereditary, claim, was, that, of, edgar, the, theling, but, due, to, his, youth, and, apparent, lack, of, powerful, supporters, he, did, not, play, a, major, part, in, the, struggles, of, 1066, although, he, was, made, king, for, a, short, time, by, the, witan, after, the, death, of, harold, godwinson, in, september, 1066, harald, iii, of, norway, and, earl, tostig, landed, in, northern, england, with, a, force, of, around, 15, 000, men, and, 300, longships, harold, godwinson, defeated, the, invaders, and, killed, harald, iii, of, norway, and, tostig, at, the, battle, of, stamford, bridge, on, 28, september, 1066, william, of, normandy, invaded, england, in, a, campaign, called, the, norman, conquest, after, marching, from, yorkshire, harold, s, exhausted, army, was, defeated, and, harold, was, killed, at, the, battle, of, hastings, on, 14, october, further, opposition, to, william, in, support, of, edgar, the, theling, soon, collapsed, and, william, was, crowned, king, on, christmas, day, 1066, for, five, years, he, faced, a, series, of, rebellions, in, various, parts, of, england, and, a, half, hearted, danish, invasion, but, he, subdued, them, and, established, an, enduring, regime, the, norman, conquest, led, to, a, profound, change, in, the, history, of, the, english, state, william, ordered, the, compilation, of, the, domesday, book, a, survey, of, the, entire, population, and, their, lands, and, property, for, tax, purposes, which, reveals, that, within, 20, years, of, the, conquest, the, english, ruling, class, had, been, almost, entirely, dispossessed, and, replaced, by, norman, landholders, who, monopolised, all, senior, positions, in, the, government, and, the, church, william, and, his, nobles, spoke, and, conducted, court, in, norman, french, in, both, normandy, and, england, the, use, of, the, anglo, norman, language, by, the, aristocracy, endured, for, centuries, and, left, an, indelible, mark, in, the, development, of, modern, english, upon, being, crowned, on, christmas, day, 1066, william, immediately, began, consolidating, his, power, by, 1067, he, faced, revolts, on, all, sides, and, spent, four, years, crushing, them, he, then, imposed, his, superiority, over, scotland, and, wales, forcing, them, to, recognise, him, as, overlord, economic, growth, and, state, finances, were, aided, by, the, beginning, of, jewish, settlement, in, london, the, english, middle, ages, were, characterised, by, civil, war, international, war, occasional, insurrection, and, widespread, political, intrigue, among, the, aristocratic, and, monarchic, elite, england, was, more, than, self, sufficient, in, cereals, dairy, products, beef, and, mutton, its, international, economy, was, based, on, wool, trade, in, which, wool, from, the, sheepwalks, of, northern, england, was, exported, to, the, textile, cities, of, flanders, where, it, was, worked, into, cloth, medieval, foreign, policy, was, as, much, shaped, by, relations, with, the, flemish, textile, industry, as, it, was, by, dynastic, adventures, in, western, france, an, english, textile, industry, was, established, in, the, 15th, century, providing, the, basis, for, rapid, english, capital, accumulation, henry, i, the, fourth, son, of, william, i, the, conqueror, succeeded, his, elder, brother, william, ii, as, king, of, england, in, 1100, henry, was, also, known, as, henry, beauclerc, because, he, received, a, formal, education, unlike, his, older, brother, and, heir, apparent, william, who, got, practical, training, to, be, king, henry, worked, hard, to, reform, and, stabilise, the, country, and, smooth, the, differences, between, the, anglo, saxon, and, anglo, norman, societies, the, loss, of, his, son, william, adelin, in, the, wreck, of, the, white, ship, in, november, 1120, undermined, his, reforms, this, problem, regarding, succession, cast, a, long, shadow, over, english, history, henry, i, had, required, the, leading, barons, ecclesiastics, and, officials, in, normandy, and, england, to, take, an, oath, to, accept, matilda, also, known, as, empress, maud, henry, i, s, daughter, as, his, heir, england, was, far, less, than, enthusiastic, to, accept, an, outsider, and, a, woman, as, their, ruler, there, is, some, evidence, that, henry, was, unsure, of, his, own, hopes, and, the, oath, to, make, matilda, his, heir, probably, henry, hoped, matilda, would, have, a, son, and, step, aside, as, queen, mother, upon, henry, s, death, the, norman, and, english, barons, ignored, matilda, s, claim, to, the, throne, and, thus, through, a, series, of, decisions, stephen, henry, s, favourite, nephew, was, welcomed, by, many, in, england, and, normandy, as, their, new, king, on, 22, december, 1135, stephen, was, anointed, king, with, implicit, support, by, the, church, and, nation, matilda, and, her, own, son, waited, in, france, until, she, sparked, the, civil, war, from, 1139, to, 1153, known, as, the, anarchy, in, the, autumn, of, 1139, she, invaded, england, with, her, illegitimate, half, brother, robert, of, gloucester, her, husband, geoffroy, v, of, anjou, conquered, normandy, but, did, not, cross, the, channel, to, help, his, wife, during, this, breakdown, of, central, authority, nobles, built, adulterine, castles, i, e, castles, erected, without, government, permission, which, were, hated, by, the, peasants, who, were, forced, to, build, and, maintain, them, stephen, was, captured, and, his, government, fell, matilda, was, proclaimed, queen, but, was, soon, at, odds, with, her, subjects, and, was, expelled, from, london, the, war, continued, until, 1148, when, matilda, returned, to, france, stephen, reigned, unopposed, until, his, death, in, 1154, although, his, hold, on, the, throne, was, uneasy, as, soon, as, he, regained, power, he, began, to, demolish, the, adulterine, castles, but, kept, a, few, castles, standing, which, put, him, at, odds, with, his, heir, his, contested, reign, civil, war, and, lawlessness, saw, a, major, swing, in, power, towards, feudal, barons, in, trying, to, appease, scottish, and, welsh, raiders, he, handed, over, large, tracts, of, land, empress, matilda, and, geoffrey, s, son, henry, resumed, the, invasion, he, was, already, count, of, anjou, duke, of, normandy, and, duke, of, aquitaine, when, he, landed, in, england, when, stephen, s, son, and, heir, apparent, eustace, died, in, 1153, stephen, made, an, agreement, with, henry, of, anjou, who, became, henry, ii, to, succeed, stephen, and, guarantee, peace, between, them, the, union, was, retrospectively, named, the, angevin, empire, henry, ii, destroyed, the, remaining, adulterine, castles, and, expanded, his, power, through, various, means, and, to, different, levels, into, ireland, scotland, wales, flanders, nantes, brittany, quercy, toulouse, bourges, and, auvergne, the, reign, of, henry, ii, represents, a, reversion, in, power, from, the, barony, to, the, monarchical, state, in, england, it, also, saw, a, similar, redistribution, of, legislative, power, from, the, church, again, to, the, monarchical, state, this, period, also, presaged, a, properly, constituted, legislation, and, a, radical, shift, away, from, feudalism, in, his, reign, new, anglo, angevin, and, anglo, aquitanian, aristocracies, developed, though, not, to, the, same, degree, as, the, anglo, norman, once, did, and, the, norman, nobles, interacted, with, their, french, peers, henry, s, successor, richard, i, the, lion, heart, also, known, as, the, absent, king, was, preoccupied, with, foreign, wars, taking, part, in, the, third, crusade, being, captured, while, returning, and, pledging, fealty, to, the, holy, roman, empire, as, part, of, his, ransom, and, defending, his, french, territories, against, philip, ii, of, france, his, successor, his, younger, brother, john, lost, much, of, those, territories, including, normandy, following, the, disastrous, battle, of, bouvines, in, 1214, despite, having, in, 1212, made, the, kingdom, of, england, a, tribute, paying, vassal, of, the, holy, see, which, it, remained, until, the, 14th, century, when, the, kingdom, rejected, the, overlordship, of, the, holy, see, and, re, established, its, sovereignty, the, first, anti, semitic, pogroms, occurred, in, the, wake, of, richard, s, crusades, in, 1189, 90, in, york, and, elsewhere, in, york, 150, jews, died, from, 1212, onwards, john, had, a, constant, policy, of, maintaining, close, relations, with, the, pope, which, partially, explains, how, he, persuaded, the, pope, to, reject, the, legitimacy, of, magna, carta, over, the, course, of, his, reign, a, combination, of, higher, taxes, unsuccessful, wars, and, conflict, with, the, pope, made, king, john, unpopular, with, his, barons, in, 1215, some, of, the, most, important, barons, rebelled, against, him, he, met, their, leaders, along, with, their, french, and, scot, allies, at, runnymede, near, london, on, 15, june, 1215, to, seal, the, great, charter, magna, carta, in, latin, which, imposed, legal, limits, on, the, king, s, personal, powers, but, as, soon, as, hostilities, ceased, john, received, approval, from, the, pope, to, break, his, word, because, he, had, made, it, under, duress, this, provoked, the, first, barons, war, and, a, french, invasion, by, prince, louis, of, france, invited, by, a, majority, of, the, english, barons, to, replace, john, as, king, in, london, in, may, 1216, john, travelled, around, the, country, to, oppose, the, rebel, forces, directing, among, other, operations, a, two, month, siege, of, the, rebel, held, rochester, castle, john, s, son, henry, iii, was, only, 9, years, old, when, he, became, king, 1216, 1272, he, spent, much, of, his, reign, fighting, the, barons, over, magna, carta, and, the, royal, rights, and, was, eventually, forced, to, call, the, first, parliament, in, 1264, he, was, also, unsuccessful, on, the, continent, where, he, endeavoured, to, re, establish, english, control, over, normandy, anjou, and, aquitaine, his, reign, was, punctuated, by, many, rebellions, and, civil, wars, often, provoked, by, incompetence, and, mismanagement, in, government, and, henry, s, perceived, over, reliance, on, french, courtiers, thus, restricting, the, influence, of, the, english, nobility, one, of, these, rebellions, led, by, a, disaffected, courtier, simon, de, montfort, was, notable, for, its, assembly, of, one, of, the, earliest, precursors, to, parliament, in, addition, to, fighting, the, second, barons, war, henry, iii, made, war, against, louis, ix, and, was, defeated, during, the, saintonge, war, yet, louis, did, not, capitalise, on, his, victory, respecting, his, opponent, s, rights, henry, iii, s, policies, towards, jews, began, with, relative, tolerance, but, became, gradually, more, restrictive, in, 1253, the, statute, of, jewry, reinforced, physical, segregation, and, demanded, a, previously, notional, requirement, to, wear, square, white, badges, henry, iii, also, backed, an, accusation, of, child, murder, in, lincoln, ordering, a, jew, copin, to, be, executed, and, 91, jews, to, be, arrested, for, trial, 18, were, killed, popular, superstitious, fears, were, fuelled, and, catholic, theological, hostility, combined, with, baronial, abuse, of, loan, arrangements, resulting, in, simon, de, montfort, s, supporters, targeting, of, jewish, communities, in, their, revolt, this, hostility, violence, and, controversy, was, the, background, to, the, increasingly, oppressive, measures, that, followed, under, edward, i, the, reign, of, edward, i, reigned, 1272, 1307, was, rather, more, successful, edward, enacted, numerous, laws, strengthening, the, powers, of, his, government, and, he, summoned, the, first, officially, sanctioned, parliaments, of, england, such, as, his, model, parliament, he, conquered, wales, and, attempted, to, use, a, succession, dispute, to, gain, control, of, the, kingdom, of, scotland, though, this, developed, into, a, costly, and, drawn, out, military, campaign, edward, i, is, also, known, for, his, policies, first, persecuting, jews, particularly, the, 1275, statute, of, the, jewry, this, banned, jews, from, their, previous, role, in, making, loans, and, demanded, that, they, work, as, merchants, farmers, craftsmen, or, soldiers, this, was, unrealistic, and, failed, edward, s, solution, was, to, expel, jews, from, england, this, was, the, first, statewide, permanent, expulsion, in, europe, his, son, edward, ii, was, considered, a, disaster, by, other, nobles, a, man, who, preferred, to, engage, in, activities, like, thatching, and, ditch, digging, and, associating, with, the, lower, class, rather, than, the, activities, considered, appropriate, for, the, upper, class, such, as, jousting, hunting, or, the, usual, entertainments, of, kings, he, spent, most, of, his, reign, trying, in, vain, to, control, the, nobility, who, in, return, showed, continual, hostility, to, him, meanwhile, the, scottish, leader, robert, bruce, began, retaking, all, the, territory, conquered, by, edward, i, in, 1314, the, english, army, was, disastrously, defeated, by, the, scots, at, the, battle, of, bannockburn, edward, also, showered, favours, on, his, companion, piers, gaveston, a, knight, of, humble, birth, while, it, has, been, widely, believed, that, edward, was, a, homosexual, because, of, his, closeness, to, gaveston, there, is, no, concrete, evidence, of, this, the, king, s, enemies, including, his, cousin, thomas, of, lancaster, captured, and, murdered, gaveston, in, 1312, the, great, famine, of, 1315, 1317, may, have, resulted, in, half, a, million, deaths, in, england, due, to, hunger, and, disease, more, than, 10, per, cent, of, the, population, edward, s, downfall, came, in, 1326, when, his, wife, queen, isabella, travelled, to, her, native, france, and, with, her, lover, roger, mortimer, invaded, england, despite, their, tiny, force, they, quickly, rallied, support, for, their, cause, the, king, fled, london, and, his, companion, since, piers, gaveston, s, death, hugh, despenser, was, publicly, tried, and, executed, edward, was, captured, charged, with, breaking, his, coronation, oath, deposed, and, imprisoned, in, gloucestershire, until, he, was, murdered, some, time, in, the, autumn, of, 1327, presumably, by, agents, of, isabella, and, mortimer, edward, iii, son, of, edward, ii, was, crowned, at, age, 14, after, his, father, was, deposed, by, his, mother, and, roger, mortimer, at, age, 17, he, led, a, successful, coup, against, mortimer, the, de, facto, ruler, of, the, country, and, began, his, personal, reign, edward, iii, reigned, 1327, 1377, restored, royal, authority, and, went, on, to, transform, england, into, the, most, efficient, military, power, in, europe, his, reign, saw, vital, developments, in, legislature, and, government, in, particular, the, evolution, of, the, english, parliament, as, well, as, the, ravages, of, the, black, death, after, defeating, but, not, subjugating, the, kingdom, of, scotland, he, declared, himself, rightful, heir, to, the, french, throne, in, 1338, but, his, claim, was, denied, due, to, the, salic, law, this, started, what, would, become, known, as, the, hundred, years, war, following, some, initial, setbacks, the, war, went, exceptionally, well, for, england, victories, at, cr, cy, and, poitiers, led, to, the, highly, favourable, treaty, of, br, tigny, edward, s, later, years, were, marked, by, international, failure, and, domestic, strife, largely, as, a, result, of, his, inactivity, and, poor, health, for, many, years, trouble, had, been, brewing, with, castile, a, spanish, kingdom, whose, navy, had, taken, to, raiding, english, merchant, ships, in, the, channel, edward, won, a, major, naval, victory, against, a, castilian, fleet, off, winchelsea, in, 1350, although, the, castilian, crossbowmen, killed, many, of, the, enemy, the, english, gradually, got, the, better, of, the, encounter, in, spite, of, edward, s, success, however, winchelsea, was, only, a, flash, in, a, conflict, that, raged, between, the, english, and, the, spanish, for, over, 200, years, coming, to, a, head, with, the, defeats, of, the, spanish, armada, and, the, english, armada, in, 1588, and, 1589, in, 1373, england, signed, an, alliance, with, the, kingdom, of, portugal, which, is, claimed, to, be, the, oldest, alliance, in, the, world, still, in, force, edward, iii, died, of, a, stroke, on, 21, june, 1377, and, was, succeeded, by, his, ten, year, old, grandson, richard, ii, he, married, anne, of, bohemia, daughter, of, charles, iv, holy, roman, emperor, in, 1382, and, ruled, until, he, was, deposed, by, his, first, cousin, henry, iv, in, 1399, in, 1381, a, peasants, revolt, led, by, wat, tyler, spread, across, large, parts, of, england, it, was, suppressed, by, richard, ii, with, the, death, of, 1500, rebels, the, black, death, an, epidemic, of, bubonic, plague, that, spread, all, over, europe, arrived, in, england, in, 1348, and, killed, as, much, as, a, third, to, half, the, population, military, conflicts, during, this, period, were, usually, with, domestic, neighbours, such, as, the, welsh, irish, and, scots, and, included, the, hundred, years, war, against, the, french, and, their, scottish, allies, notable, english, victories, in, the, hundred, years, war, included, cr, cy, and, agincourt, the, final, defeat, of, the, uprising, led, by, the, welsh, prince, owain, glynd, r, in, 1412, by, prince, henry, who, later, became, henry, v, represents, the, last, major, armed, attempt, by, the, welsh, to, throw, off, english, rule, edward, iii, gave, land, to, powerful, noble, families, including, many, people, of, royal, lineage, because, land, was, equivalent, to, power, these, powerful, men, could, try, to, claim, the, crown, when, edward, iii, died, in, 1377, he, was, succeeded, by, his, grandson, richard, ii, richard, s, autocratic, and, arrogant, methods, only, served, to, alienate, the, nobility, more, and, his, forceful, dispossession, in, 1399, by, henry, iv, increased, the, turmoil, henry, spent, much, of, his, reign, defending, himself, against, plots, rebellions, and, assassination, attempts, rebellions, continued, throughout, the, first, ten, years, of, henry, s, reign, including, the, revolt, of, owain, glynd, r, who, declared, himself, prince, of, wales, in, 1400, and, the, rebellion, of, henry, percy, 1st, earl, of, northumberland, the, king, s, success, in, putting, down, these, rebellions, was, due, partly, to, the, military, ability, of, his, eldest, son, henry, of, monmouth, who, later, became, king, though, the, son, managed, to, seize, much, effective, power, from, his, father, in, 1410, henry, v, succeeded, to, the, throne, in, 1413, he, renewed, hostilities, with, france, and, began, a, set, of, military, campaigns, which, are, considered, a, new, phase, of, the, hundred, years, war, referred, to, as, the, lancastrian, war, he, won, several, notable, victories, over, the, french, including, the, battle, of, agincourt, in, the, treaty, of, troyes, henry, v,

they, married, in, 1421, henry, died, of, dysentery, in, 1422, leaving, a, number, of, unfulfilled, plans, including, his, plan, to, take, over, as, king, of, france, and, to, lead, a, crusade, to, retake, jerusalem, from, the, muslims, henry, v, s, son, henry, vi, became, king, in, 1422, as, an, infant, his, reign, was, marked, by, constant, turmoil, due, to, his, political, weaknesses, while, he, was, growing, up, england, was, ruled, by, the, regency, government, the, regency, council, tried, to, install, henry, vi, as, the, king, of, france, as, provided, by, the, treaty, of, troyes, signed, by, his, father, and, led, english, forces, to, take, over, areas, of, france, it, appeared, they, might, succeed, due, to, the, poor, political, position, of, the, son, of, charles, vi, who, had, claimed, to, be, the, rightful, king, as, charles, vii, of, france, however, in, 1429, joan, of, arc, began, a, military, effort, to, prevent, the, english, from, gaining, control, of, france, the, french, forces, regained, control, of, french, territory, in, 1437, henry, vi, came, of, age, and, began, to, actively, rule, as, king, to, forge, peace, he, married, french, noblewoman, margaret, of, anjou, in, 1445, as, provided, in, the, treaty, of, tours, hostilities, with, france, resumed, in, 1449, when, england, lost, the, hundred, years, war, in, august, 1453, henry, fell, into, mental, breakdown, until, christmas, 1454, henry, could, not, control, the, feuding, nobles, and, a, series, of, civil, wars, known, as, the, wars, of, the, roses, began, lasting, from, 1455, to, 1485, although, the, fighting, was, very, sporadic, and, small, there, was, a, general, breakdown, in, the, power, of, the, crown, the, royal, court, and, parliament, moved, to, coventry, in, the, lancastrian, heartlands, which, thus, became, the, capital, of, england, until, 1461, henry, s, cousin, edward, duke, of, york, deposed, henry, in, 1461, to, become, edward, iv, following, a, lancastrian, defeat, at, the, battle, of, mortimer, s, cross, edward, was, later, briefly, expelled, from, the, throne, in, 1470, 1471, when, richard, neville, earl, of, warwick, brought, henry, back, to, power, six, months, later, edward, defeated, and, killed, warwick, in, battle, and, reclaimed, the, throne, henry, was, imprisoned, in, the, tower, of, london, and, died, there, edward, died, in, 1483, only, 40, years, old, his, reign, having, gone, a, little, way, to, restoring, the, power, of, the, crown, his, eldest, son, and, heir, edward, v, aged, 12, could, not, succeed, him, because, the, king, s, brother, richard, iii, duke, of, gloucester, declared, edward, iv, s, marriage, bigamous, making, all, his, children, illegitimate, richard, iii, was, then, declared, king, and, edward, v, and, his, 10, year, old, brother, richard, were, imprisoned, in, the, tower, of, london, the, two, were, never, seen, again, it, was, widely, believed, that, richard, iii, had, them, murdered, and, he, was, reviled, as, a, treacherous, fiend, which, limited, his, ability, to, govern, during, his, brief, reign, in, summer, 1485, henry, tudor, the, last, lancastrian, male, returned, from, exile, in, france, and, landed, in, wales, henry, then, defeated, and, killed, richard, iii, at, bosworth, field, on, 22, august, and, was, crowned, henry, vii, the, tudor, period, coincides, with, the, dynasty, of, the, house, of, tudor, in, england, that, began, with, the, reign, of, henry, vii, henry, engaged, in, a, number, of, administrative, economic, and, diplomatic, initiatives, he, paid, very, close, attention, to, detail, and, instead, of, spending, lavishly, concentrated, on, raising, new, revenues, henry, was, successful, in, restoring, power, and, stability, to, the, nation, s, monarchy, following, the, civil, war, his, supportive, policy, toward, england, s, wool, industry, and, his, standoff, with, the, low, countries, had, long, lasting, benefit, to, the, economy, of, england, he, restored, the, nation, s, finances, and, strengthened, its, judicial, system, the, renaissance, reached, england, through, italian, courtiers, who, reintroduced, artistic, educational, and, scholarly, debate, from, classical, antiquity, england, began, to, develop, naval, skills, and, exploration, intensified, in, the, age, of, discovery, with, henry, vii, s, accession, to, the, throne, in, 1485, the, wars, of, the, roses, came, to, an, end, and, tudors, would, continue, to, rule, england, for, 118, years, traditionally, the, battle, of, bosworth, field, is, considered, to, mark, the, end, of, the, middle, ages, in, england, although, henry, did, not, introduce, any, new, concept, of, monarchy, and, for, most, of, his, reign, his, hold, on, power, was, tenuous, he, claimed, the, throne, by, conquest, and, god, s, judgement, in, battle, parliament, quickly, recognised, him, as, king, but, the, yorkists, were, far, from, defeated, nonetheless, he, married, edward, iv, s, eldest, daughter, elizabeth, in, january, 1486, thereby, uniting, the, houses, of, york, and, lancaster, most, of, the, european, rulers, did, not, believe, henry, would, survive, long, and, were, thus, willing, to, shelter, claimants, against, him, the, first, plot, against, him, was, the, stafford, and, lovell, rebellion, of, 1486, which, presented, no, serious, threat, but, richard, iii, s, nephew, john, de, la, pole, earl, of, lincoln, hatched, another, attempt, the, following, year, using, a, peasant, boy, named, lambert, simnel, who, posed, as, edward, earl, of, warwick, the, real, warwick, was, locked, up, in, the, tower, of, london, he, led, an, army, of, 2, 000, german, mercenaries, paid, for, by, margaret, of, burgundy, into, england, they, were, defeated, and, de, la, pole, was, killed, at, the, difficult, battle, of, stoke, where, the, loyalty, of, some, of, the, royal, troops, to, henry, was, questionable, the, king, realizing, that, simnel, was, a, dupe, employed, him, in, the, royal, kitchen, a, more, serious, threat, was, perkin, warbeck, a, flemish, youth, who, posed, as, edward, iv, s, son, richard, again, with, support, from, margaret, of, burgundy, he, invaded, england, four, times, from, 1495, to, 1497, before, he, was, captured, and, imprisoned, in, the, tower, of, london, both, warbeck, and, the, earl, of, warwick, were, dangerous, even, in, captivity, and, henry, executed, them, in, 1499, before, ferdinand, and, isabella, of, spain, would, allow, their, daughter, catherine, to, come, to, england, and, marry, his, son, arthur, in, 1497, henry, defeated, cornish, rebels, marching, on, london, the, rest, of, his, reign, was, relatively, peaceful, despite, worries, about, succession, after, the, death, of, his, wife, elizabeth, of, york, in, 1503, henry, vii, s, foreign, policy, was, peaceful, he, had, made, an, alliance, with, spain, and, the, holy, roman, emperor, maximilian, i, but, in, 1493, when, they, went, to, war, with, france, england, was, dragged, into, the, conflict, impoverished, and, his, hold, on, power, insecure, henry, had, no, desire, for, war, he, quickly, reached, an, understanding, with, the, french, and, renounced, all, claims, to, their, territory, except, the, port, of, calais, realizing, also, that, he, could, not, stop, them, from, incorporating, the, duchy, of, brittany, in, return, the, french, agreed, to, recognize, him, as, king, and, stop, sheltering, pretenders, shortly, afterwards, they, became, preoccupied, with, adventures, in, italy, henry, also, reached, an, understanding, with, scotland, agreeing, to, marry, his, daughter, margaret, to, that, country, s, king, james, iv, upon, becoming, king, henry, inherited, a, government, severely, weakened, and, degraded, by, the, wars, of, the, roses, the, treasury, was, empty, having, been, drained, by, edward, iv, s, woodville, in, laws, after, his, death, through, a, tight, fiscal, policy, and, sometimes, ruthless, tax, collection, and, confiscations, henry, refilled, the, treasury, by, the, time, of, his, death, he, also, effectively, rebuilt, the, machinery, of, government, in, 1501, the, king, s, son, arthur, having, married, catherine, of, aragon, died, of, illness, at, age, 15, leaving, his, younger, brother, henry, duke, of, york, as, heir, when, the, king, himself, died, in, 1509, the, position, of, the, tudors, was, secure, at, last, and, his, son, succeeded, him, unopposed, henry, viii, began, his, reign, with, much, optimism, the, handsome, athletic, young, king, stood, in, sharp, contrast, to, his, wary, miserly, father, henry, s, lavish, court, quickly, drained, the, treasury, of, the, fortune, he, inherited, he, married, the, widowed, catherine, of, aragon, and, they, had, several, children, but, none, survived, infancy, except, a, daughter, mary, in, 1512, the, young, king, started, a, war, in, france, although, england, was, an, ally, of, spain, one, of, france, s, principal, enemies, the, war, was, mostly, about, henry, s, desire, for, personal, glory, despite, his, sister, mary, being, married, to, the, french, king, louis, xii, the, war, accomplished, little, the, english, army, suffered, badly, from, disease, and, henry, was, not, even, present, at, the, one, notable, victory, the, battle, of, the, spurs, meanwhile, james, iv, of, scotland, despite, being, henry, s, other, brother, in, law, activated, his, alliance, with, the, french, and, declared, war, on, england, while, henry, was, dallying, in, france, catherine, who, was, serving, as, regent, in, his, absence, and, his, advisers, were, left, to, deal, with, this, threat, at, the, battle, of, flodden, on, 9, september, 1513, the, scots, were, completely, defeated, james, and, most, of, the, scottish, nobles, were, killed, when, henry, returned, from, france, he, was, given, credit, for, the, victory, eventually, catherine, was, no, longer, able, to, have, any, more, children, the, king, became, increasingly, nervous, about, the, possibility, of, his, daughter, mary, inheriting, the, throne, as, england, s, one, experience, with, a, female, sovereign, matilda, in, the, 12th, century, had, been, a, catastrophe, he, eventually, decided, that, it, was, necessary, to, divorce, catherine, and, find, a, new, queen, to, persuade, the, church, to, allow, this, henry, cited, the, passage, in, the, book, of, leviticus, if, a, man, taketh, his, brother, s, wife, he, hath, committed, adultery, they, shall, be, childless, however, catherine, insisted, that, she, and, arthur, never, consummated, their, brief, marriage, and, that, the, prohibition, did, not, apply, here, the, timing, of, henry, s, case, was, very, unfortunate, it, was, 1527, and, the, pope, had, been, imprisoned, by, emperor, charles, v, catherine, s, nephew, and, the, most, powerful, man, in, europe, for, siding, with, his, archenemy, francis, i, of, france, because, he, could, not, divorce, in, these, circumstances, henry, seceded, from, the, church, in, what, became, known, as, the, english, reformation, the, newly, established, church, of, england, amounted, to, little, more, than, the, existing, catholic, church, but, led, by, the, king, rather, than, the, pope, it, took, a, number, of, years, for, the, separation, from, rome, to, be, completed, and, many, were, executed, for, resisting, the, king, s, religious, policies, in, 1530, catherine, was, banished, from, court, and, spent, the, rest, of, her, life, until, her, death, in, 1536, alone, in, an, isolated, manor, home, barred, from, contact, with, mary, secret, correspondence, continued, thanks, to, her, ladies, in, waiting, their, marriage, was, declared, invalid, making, mary, an, illegitimate, child, henry, married, anne, boleyn, secretly, in, january, 1533, just, as, his, divorce, from, catherine, was, finalised, they, had, a, second, public, wedding, anne, soon, became, pregnant, and, may, have, already, been, when, they, wed, but, on, 7, september, 1533, she, gave, birth, to, a, daughter, elizabeth, the, king, was, devastated, at, his, failure, to, obtain, a, son, after, all, the, effort, it, had, taken, to, remarry, gradually, he, came, to, develop, a, disliking, of, his, new, queen, for, her, strange, behaviour, in, 1536, when, anne, was, pregnant, again, henry, was, badly, injured, in, a, jousting, accident, shaken, by, this, the, queen, gave, birth, prematurely, to, a, stillborn, boy, by, now, the, king, was, convinced, that, his, marriage, was, hexed, and, having, already, found, a, new, queen, jane, seymour, he, put, anne, in, the, tower, of, london, on, charges, of, witchcraft, afterwards, she, was, beheaded, along, with, five, men, her, brother, included, accused, of, adultery, with, her, the, marriage, was, then, declared, invalid, so, that, elizabeth, just, like, her, half, sister, became, a, bastard, henry, immediately, married, jane, seymour, who, became, pregnant, almost, as, quickly, on, 12, october, 1537, she, gave, birth, to, a, healthy, boy, edward, which, was, greeted, with, huge, celebrations, however, the, queen, died, of, puerperal, sepsis, ten, days, later, henry, genuinely, mourned, her, death, and, at, his, own, passing, nine, years, later, he, was, buried, next, to, her, the, king, married, a, fourth, time, in, 1540, to, the, german, anne, of, cleves, for, a, political, alliance, with, her, protestant, brother, the, duke, of, cleves, he, also, hoped, to, obtain, another, son, in, case, something, should, happen, to, edward, anne, proved, a, dull, unattractive, woman, and, henry, did, not, consummate, the, marriage, he, quickly, divorced, her, and, she, remained, in, england, as, a, kind, of, adopted, sister, to, him, he, married, again, to, a, 19, year, old, named, catherine, howard, but, when, it, became, known, that, she, was, neither, a, virgin, at, the, wedding, nor, a, faithful, wife, afterwards, she, ended, up, on, the, scaffold, and, the, marriage, declared, invalid, his, sixth, and, last, marriage, was, to, catherine, parr, who, was, more, his, nursemaid, than, anything, else, as, his, health, was, failing, since, his, jousting, accident, in, 1536, in, 1542, the, king, started, a, new, campaign, in, france, but, unlike, in, 1512, he, only, managed, with, great, difficulty, he, only, conquered, the, city, of, boulogne, which, france, retook, in, 1549, scotland, also, declared, war, and, at, solway, moss, was, again, totally, defeated, henry, s, paranoia, and, suspicion, worsened, in, his, last, years, the, number, of, executions, during, his, 38, year, reign, numbered, tens, of, thousands, his, domestic, policies, had, strengthened, royal, authority, to, the, detriment, of, the, aristocracy, and, led, to, a, safer, realm, but, his, foreign, policy, adventures, did, not, increase, england, s, prestige, abroad, and, wrecked, royal, finances, and, the, national, economy, and, embittered, the, irish, he, died, in, january, 1547, at, age, 55, and, was, succeeded, by, his, son, edward, vi, although, he, showed, piety, and, intelligence, edward, vi, was, only, nine, years, old, when, he, became, king, in, 1547, his, uncle, edward, seymour, 1st, duke, of, somerset, tampered, with, henry, viii, s, will, and, obtained, letters, patent, giving, him, much, of, the, power, of, a, monarch, by, march, 1547, he, took, the, title, of, protector, while, some, see, him, as, a, high, minded, idealist, his, stay, in, power, culminated, in, a, crisis, in, 1549, when, many, counties, of, the, realm, were, up, in, protest, kett, s, rebellion, in, norfolk, and, the, prayer, book, rebellion, in, devon, and, cornwall, simultaneously, created, a, crisis, while, invasion, from, scotland, and, france, were, feared, somerset, disliked, by, the, regency, council, for, being, autocratic, was, removed, from, power, by, john, dudley, who, is, known, as, lord, president, northumberland, northumberland, proceeded, to, adopt, the, power, for, himself, but, he, was, more, conciliatory, and, the, council, accepted, him, during, edward, s, reign, england, changed, from, being, a, catholic, nation, to, a, protestant, one, in, schism, from, rome, edward, showed, great, promise, but, fell, violently, ill, of, tuberculosis, in, 1553, and, died, that, august, at, the, age, of, 15, years, 8, months, northumberland, made, plans, to, place, lady, jane, grey, on, the, throne, and, marry, her, to, his, son, so, that, he, could, remain, the, power, behind, the, throne, his, plot, failed, in, a, matter, of, days, jane, grey, was, beheaded, and, mary, i, 1516, 1558, took, the, throne, amidst, popular, demonstration, in, her, favour, in, london, which, contemporaries, described, as, the, largest, show, of, affection, for, a, tudor, monarch, mary, had, never, been, expected, to, hold, the, throne, at, least, not, since, edward, was, born, she, was, a, devoted, catholic, who, believed, that, she, could, reverse, the, reformation, returning, england, to, catholicism, led, to, the, burnings, of, 274, protestants, which, are, recorded, especially, in, john, foxe, s, book, of, martyrs, mary, then, married, her, cousin, philip, son, of, emperor, charles, v, and, king, of, spain, when, charles, abdicated, in, 1556, the, union, was, difficult, because, mary, was, already, in, her, late, 30s, and, philip, was, a, catholic, and, a, foreigner, and, so, not, very, welcome, in, england, this, wedding, also, provoked, hostility, from, france, already, at, war, with, spain, and, now, fearing, being, encircled, by, the, habsburgs, calais, the, last, english, outpost, on, the, continent, was, then, taken, by, france, king, philip, 1527, 1598, had, very, little, power, although, he, did, protect, elizabeth, he, was, not, popular, in, england, and, spent, little, time, there, mary, eventually, became, pregnant, or, at, least, believed, herself, to, be, in, reality, she, may, have, had, uterine, cancer, her, death, in, november, 1558, was, greeted, with, huge, celebrations, in, the, streets, of, london, after, mary, i, died, in, 1558, elizabeth, i, came, to, the, throne, her, reign, restored, a, sort, of, order, to, the, realm, after, the, turbulent, reigns, of, edward, vi, and, mary, i, the, religious, issue, which, had, divided, the, country, since, henry, viii, was, in, a, way, put, to, rest, by, the, elizabethan, religious, settlement, which, re, established, the, church, of, england, much, of, elizabeth, s, success, was, in, balancing, the, interests, of, the, puritans, and, catholics, historian, robert, bucholz, paraphrasing, historian, conrad, russell, suggested, that, the, genius, of, the, church, of, england, was, that, it, thinks, protestant, but, looks, catholic, she, managed, to, offend, neither, to, a, large, extent, although, she, clamped, down, on, catholics, towards, the, end, of, her, reign, as, war, with, catholic, spain, loomed, despite, the, need, for, an, heir, elizabeth, declined, to, marry, despite, offers, from, a, number, of, suitors, across, europe, including, the, swedish, king, erik, xiv, this, created, endless, worries, over, her, succession, especially, in, the, 1560s, when, she, nearly, died, of, smallpox, it, has, been, often, rumoured, that, she, had, a, number, of, lovers, including, francis, drake, but, there, is, no, hard, evidence, elizabeth, maintained, relative, government, stability, apart, from, the, revolt, of, the, northern, earls, in, 1569, she, was, effective, in, reducing, the, power, of, the, old, nobility, and, expanding, the, power, of, her, government, elizabeth, s, government, did, much, to, consolidate, the, work, begun, under, thomas, cromwell, in, the, reign, of, henry, viii, that, is, expanding, the, role, of, the, government, and, effecting, common, law, and, administration, throughout, england, during, the, reign, of, elizabeth, and, shortly, afterwards, the, population, grew, significantly, from, three, million, in, 1564, to, nearly, five, million, in, 1616, the, queen, ran, afoul, of, her, cousin, mary, queen, of, scots, who, was, a, devoted, catholic, and, so, was, forced, to, abdicate, her, throne, scotland, had, recently, become, protestant, she, fled, to, england, where, elizabeth, immediately, had, her, arrested, mary, spent, the, next, 19, years, in, confinement, but, proved, too, dangerous, to, keep, alive, as, the, catholic, powers, in, europe, considered, her, the, legitimate, ruler, of, england, she, was, eventually, tried, for, treason, sentenced, to, death, and, beheaded, in, february, 1587, the, elizabethan, era, was, the, epoch, in, english, history, of, queen, elizabeth, i, s, reign, 1558, 1603, historians, often, depict, it, as, the, golden, age, in, english, history, the, symbol, of, britannia, was, first, used, in, 1572, and, often, thereafter, to, mark, the, elizabethan, age, as, a, renaissance, that, inspired, national, pride, through, classical, ideals, international, expansion, and, naval, triumph, over, the, hated, spanish, foe, in, terms, of, the, entire, century, the, historian, john, guy, 1988, argues, that, england, was, economically, healthier, more, expansive, and, more, optimistic, under, the, tudors, than, at, any, time, in, a, thousand, years, this, golden, age, represented, the, apogee, of, the, english, renaissance, and, saw, the, flowering, of, poetry, music, and, literature, the, era, is, most, famous, for, theatre, as, william, shakespeare, and, many, others, composed, plays, that, broke, free, of, england, s, past, style, of, theatre, it, was, an, age, of, exploration, and, expansion, abroad, while, back, at, home, the, protestant, reformation, became, more, acceptable, to, the, people, most, certainly, after, the, spanish, armada, was, repulsed, it, was, also, the, end, of, the, period, when, england, was, a, separate, realm, before, its, royal, union, with, scotland, the, elizabethan, age, is, viewed, so, highly, largely, because, of, the, periods, before, and, after, it, was, a, brief, period, of, largely, internal, peace, after, the, horrible, violence, and, disorder, of, the, wars, of, the, roses, and, battles, between, catholics, and, protestants, during, the, english, reformation, and, it, preceded, the, violent, turmoil, of, the, english, civil, war, and, battles, between, parliament, and, the, monarchy, during, the, 17th, century, the, protestant, catholic, divide, was, settled, for, a, time, by, the, elizabethan, religious, settlement, and, parliament, was, not, yet, strong, enough, to, challenge, royal, absolutism, england, was, also, well, off, compared, to, the, other, nations, of, europe, the, italian, renaissance, had, ended, due, to, foreign, domination, of, the, peninsula, france, was, embroiled, in, religious, battles, until, the, edict, of, nantes, in, 1598, also, the, english, had, been, expelled, from, their, last, outposts, on, the, continent, due, to, these, reasons, the, centuries, long, conflict, with, france, was, largely, suspended, for, most, of, elizabeth, s, reign, england, during, this, period, had, a, centralised, organised, and, effective, government, largely, due, to, the, reforms, of, henry, vii, and, henry, viii, economically, the, country, began, to, benefit, greatly, from, the, new, era, of, trans, atlantic, trade, in, 1585, worsening, relations, between, philip, ii, of, spain, and, elizabeth, erupted, into, war, elizabeth, signed, the, treaty, of, nonsuch, with, the, dutch, and, permitted, francis, drake, to, maraud, in, response, to, a, spanish, embargo, drake, surprised, vigo, spain, in, october, then, proceeded, to, the, caribbean, and, sacked, santo, domingo, the, capital, of, spain, s, american, empire, and, the, present, day, capital, of, the, dominican, republic, and, cartagena, a, large, and, wealthy, port, on, the, north, coast, of, colombia, that, was, the, centre, of, the, silver, trade, philip, ii, tried, to, invade, england, with, the, spanish, armada, in, 1588, but, was, famously, defeated, the, armada, was, not, just, a, naval, campaign, the, build, up, of, land, forces, to, resist, a, spanish, invasion, has, been, described, as, an, administrative, feat, of, massive, scope, a, survey, taken, in, november, and, december, 1587, showed, 130, 000, men, in, the, militia, of, whom, 44, 000, were, members, of, the, trained, bands, being, drilled, and, led, by, experienced, captains, and, sergeants, by, may, 1588, the, london, bands, were, drilling, weekly, to, give, warning, of, the, enemy, s, approach, beacons, were, built, manned, twenty, four, hours, a, day, by, four, men, once, the, beacons, were, lit, 72, 000, men, could, be, mobilised, on, the, south, coast, with, another, 46, 000, protecting, london, for, the, many, englishmen, caught, up, in, the, armada, the, experience, must, have, been, very, profound, and, frightening, some, shared, the, intimacy, of, beacon, watching, hoping, for, the, best, but, ready, to, light, their, warning, fires, in, case, of, the, worst, deloney, a, london, silkweaver, played, on, their, fears, in, his, new, ballet, on, the, strange, whippes, which, the, spanyards, had, prepared, to, whippe, english, men, 1588, the, political, philosopher, thomas, hobbes, recalled, that, his, mother, was, so, frightened, that, she, prematurely, gave, birth, to, twins, of, whom, he, was, one, all, were, terrified, about, what, might, happen, if, the, spanish, invaded, stories, of, the, sack, of, antwerp, in, 1576, in, which, the, spanish, led, by, sancho, d, avila, raped, tortured, and, murdered, as, many, as, 17, 000, civilians, were, grist, for, playwrights, and, pamphleteers, such, as, george, gascoigne, and, shakespeare, the, former, remembered, seeing, civilians, at, antwerp, drowned, burned, or, with, guts, hanging, out, as, if, they, had, been, used, for, an, anatomy, lesson, few, englishmen, women, and, children, doubted, they, faced, similar, fates, had, the, armada, landed, in, foreign, policy, elizabeth, played, against, each, other, the, major, powers, france, and, spain, as, well, as, the, papacy, and, scotland, these, were, all, catholic, and, each, wanted, to, end, protestantism, in, england, elizabeth, was, cautious, in, foreign, affairs, and, only, half, heartedly, supported, a, number, of, ineffective, poorly, resourced, military, campaigns, in, the, netherlands, france, and, ireland, she, risked, war, with, spain, by, supporting, the, sea, dogs, such, as, walter, raleigh, john, hawkins, and, sir, francis, drake, who, preyed, on, spanish, merchant, ships, carrying, gold, and, silver, from, the, new, world, drake, himself, became, a, hero, being, the, first, englishman, to, circumnavigate, the, world, between, 1577, and, 1580, having, plundered, spanish, settlements, and, treasure, ships, the, major, war, came, with, spain, 1585, 1603, when, spain, tried, to, invade, and, conquer, england, it, was, a, fiasco, and, the, defeat, of, the, spanish, armada, in, 1588, associated, elizabeth, s, name, with, what, is, popularly, viewed, as, one, of, the, greatest, victories, in, english, history, her, enemies, failed, to, combine, and, elizabeth, s, foreign, policy, successfully, navigated, all, the, dangers, the, following, year, an, english, armada, also, known, as, the, counter, armada, or, the, drake, norris, expedition, of, a, similar, size, to, the, spanish, one, was, sent, against, spain, in, order, to, drive, home, the, advantage, that, england, had, gained, led, by, sir, francis, drake, as, admiral, and, sir, john, norris, as, general, the, war, ended, with, both, sides, seeking, peace, in, order, to, stop, the, costly, conflict, with, the, treaty, of, london, in, 1604, which, validated, the, status, quo, ante, bellum, it, amounted, to, an, acknowledgement, by, spain, that, its, hopes, of, restoring, roman, catholicism, in, england, were, at, an, end, and, it, had, to, recognise, the, protestant, monarchy, in, england, in, return, england, ended, its, financial, and, military, support, for, the, dutch, rebellion, ongoing, since, the, treaty, of, nonsuch, 1585, and, had, to, end, its, wartime, disruption, of, spanish, trans, atlantic, shipping, and, colonial, expansion, in, all, the, tudor, period, is, seen, as, a, decisive, one, which, set, up, many, important, questions, which, would, have, to, be, answered, in, the, next, century, and, during, the, english, civil, war, these, were, questions, of, the, relative, power, of, the, monarch, and, parliament, and, to, what, extent, one, should, control, the, other, some, historians, think, that, thomas, cromwell, affected, a, tudor, revolution, in, government, and, it, is, certain, that, parliament, became, more, important, during, his, chancellorship, other, historians, argue, that, the, tudor, revolution, extended, to, the, end, of, elizabeth, s, reign, when, the, work, was, all, consolidated, although, the, privy, council, declined, after, elizabeth, s, death, it, was, very, effective, while, she, was, alive, elizabeth, died, in, 1603, at, the, age, of, 69, when, elizabeth, died, her, closest, male, protestant, relative, was, the, king, of, scots, james, vi, of, the, house, of, stuart, who, became, king, james, i, of, england, in, a, union, of, the, crowns, called, james, i, and, vi, he, was, the, first, monarch, to, rule, the, entire, island, of, britain, but, the, countries, remained, separate, politically, upon, taking, power, james, made, peace, with, spain, and, for, the, first, half, of, the, 17th, century, england, remained, largely, inactive, in, european, politics, several, assassination, attempts, were, made, on, james, notably, the, main, plot, and, bye, plots, of, 1603, and, most, famously, on, 5, november, 1605, the, gunpowder, plot, by, a, group, of, catholic, conspirators, led, by, robert, catesby, which, caused, more, antipathy, in, england, towards, catholicism, in, 1607, england, built, an, establishment, at, jamestown, this, was, the, beginning, of, colonialism, by, england, in, north, america, many, english, settled, then, in, north, america, for, religious, or, economic, reasons, approximately, 70, of, english, immigrants, to, north, america, who, came, between, 1630, and, 1660, were, indentured, servants, by, 1700, chesapeake, planters, transported, about, 100, 000, indentured, servants, who, accounted, for, more, than, 75, of, all, european, immigrants, to, virginia, and, maryland, the, first, english, civil, war, broke, out, in, 1642, largely, due, to, ongoing, conflicts, between, james, son, charles, i, and, parliament, the, defeat, of, the, royalist, army, by, the, new, model, army, of, parliament, at, the, battle, of, naseby, in, june, 1645, effectively, destroyed, the, king, s, forces, charles, surrendered, to, the, scottish, army, at, newark, he, was, eventually, handed, over, to, the, english, parliament, in, early, 1647, he, escaped, and, the, second, english, civil, war, began, but, the, new, model, army, quickly, secured, the, country, the, capture, and, trial, of, charles, led, to, the, execution, of, charles, i, in, january, 1649, at, whitehall, gate, in, london, making, england, a, republic, this, shocked, the, rest, of, europe, the, king, argued, to, the, end, that, only, god, could, judge, him, the, new, model, army, commanded, by, oliver, cromwell, then, scored, decisive, victories, against, royalist, armies, in, ireland, and, scotland, cromwell, was, given, the, title, lord, protector, in, 1653, making, him, king, in, all, but, name, to, his, critics, after, he, died, in, 1658, his, son, richard, cromwell, succeeded, him, in, the, office, but, he, was, forced, to, abdicate, within, a, year, for, a, while, it, seemed, as, if, a, new, civil, war, would, begin, as, the, new, model, army, split, into, factions, troops, stationed, in, scotland, under, the, command, of, george, monck, eventually, marched, on, london, to, restore, order, according, to, derek, hirst, outside, of, politics, and, religion, the, 1640s, and, 1650s, saw, a, revived, economy, characterised, by, growth, in, manufacturing, the, elaboration, of, financial, and, credit, instruments, and, the, commercialisation, of, communication, the, gentry, found, time, for, leisure, activities, such, as, horse, racing, and, bowling, in, the, high, culture, important, innovations, included, the, development, of, a, mass, market, for, music, increased, scientific, research, and, an, expansion, of, publishing, all, the, trends, were, discussed, in, depth, at, the, newly, established, coffee, houses, the, monarchy, was, restored, in, 1660, with, king, charles, ii, returning, to, london, however, the, power, of, the, crown, was, less, than, before, the, civil, war, by, the, 18th, century, england, rivaled, the, netherlands, as, one, of, the, freest, countries, in, europe, in, 1665, london, was, swept, by, the, plague, and, in, 1666, by, the, great, fire, for, 5, days, which, destroyed, about, 15, 000, buildings, in, 1680, the, exclusion, crisis, consisted, of, attempts, to, prevent, accession, of, james, heir, to, charles, ii, because, he, was, catholic, after, charles, ii, died, in, 1685, and, his, younger, brother, james, ii, and, vii, was, crowned, various, factions, pressed, for, his, protestant, daughter, mary, and, her, husband, prince, william, iii, of, orange, to, replace, him, in, what, became, known, as, the, glorious, revolution, in, november, 1688, william, invaded, england, and, succeeded, in, being, crowned, james, tried, to, retake, the, throne, in, the, williamite, war, but, was, defeated, at, the, battle, of, the, boyne, in, 1690, in, december, 1689, one, of, the, most, important, constitutional, documents, in, english, history, the, bill, of, rights, was, passed, the, bill, which, restated, and, confirmed, many, provisions, of, the, earlier, declaration, of, right, established, restrictions, on, the, royal, prerogative, for, example, the, sovereign, could, not, suspend, laws, passed, by, parliament, levy, taxes, without, parliamentary, consent, infringe, the, right, to, petition, raise, a, standing, army, during, peacetime, without, parliamentary, consent, deny, the, right, to, bear, arms, to, protestant, subjects, unduly, interfere, with, parliamentary, elections, punish, members, of, either, house, of, parliament, for, anything, said, during, debates, require, excessive, bail, or, inflict, cruel, and, unusual, punishments, william, was, opposed, to, such, constraints, but, chose, to, avoid, conflict, with, parliament, and, agreed, to, the, statute, in, parts, of, scotland, and, ireland, catholics, loyal, to, james, remained, determined, to, see, him, restored, to, the, throne, and, staged, a, series, of, bloody, uprisings, as, a, result, any, failure, to, pledge, loyalty, to, the, victorious, king, william, was, severely, dealt, with, the, most, infamous, example, of, this, policy, was, the, massacre, of, glencoe, in, 1692, jacobite, rebellions, continued, into, the, mid, 18th, century, until, the, son, of, the, last, catholic, claimant, to, the, throne, james, iii, and, viii, mounted, a, final, campaign, in, 1745, the, jacobite, forces, of, prince, charles, edward, stuart, the, bonnie, prince, charlie, of, legend, were, defeated, at, the, battle, of, culloden, in, 1746, the, acts, of, union, between, the, kingdom, of, england, and, the, kingdom, of, scotland, were, a, pair, of, parliamentary, acts, passed, by, both, parliaments, in, 1707, which, dissolved, them, in, order, to, form, a, kingdom, of, great, britain, governed, by, a, unified, parliament, of, great, britain, according, to, the, treaty, of, union, the, acts, joined, the, kingdom, of, england, and, the, kingdom, of, scotland, previously, separate, independent, states, with, separate, legislatures, but, with, the, same, monarch, starting, with, james, i, of, england, also, james, vi, of, scotland, into, a, single, kingdom, the, two, countries, had, shared, a, monarch, since, the, union, of, the, crowns, in, 1603, when, king, james, vi, of, scotland, inherited, the, english, throne, from, his, double, first, cousin, twice, removed, queen, elizabeth, i, although, described, as, a, union, of, crowns, until, 1707, there, were, in, fact, two, separate, crowns, resting, on, the, same, head, there, had, been, three, attempts, in, 1606, 1667, and, 1689, to, unite, the, two, countries, by, acts, of, parliament, but, it, was, not, until, the, early, 18th, century, that, the, idea, had, the, will, of, both, political, establishments, behind, them, albeit, for, rather, different, reasons, the, acts, took, effect, on, 1, may, 1707, on, this, date, the, english, parliament, and, the, scottish, parliament, united, to, form, the, parliament, of, great, britain, based, in, the, palace, of, westminster, in, london, the, home, of, the, english, parliament, hence, the, acts, are, referred, to, as, the, union, of, the, parliaments, on, the, union, historian, simon, schama, said, what, began, as, a, hostile, merger, would, end, in, a, full, partnership, in, the, most, powerful, going, concern, in, the, world, it, was, one, of, the, most, astonishing, transformations, in, european, history, in, 1714, ended, the, reign, of, queen, anne, the, last, monarch, of, the, house, of, stuart, she, was, succeeded, by, her, second, cousin, george, i, of, the, house, of, hanover, who, was, a, descendant, of, the, stuarts, through, his, maternal, grandmother, elizabeth, daughter, of, james, vi, i, a, series, of, jacobite, rebellions, broke, out, in, an, attempt, to, restore, the, stuart, monarchy, but, failed, several, planned, french, invasions, were, attempted, also, with, the, intention, of, placing, the, stuarts, on, the, throne, the, act, of, union, of, 1800, formally, assimilated, ireland, within, the, british, political, process, and, from, 1, january, 1801, created, a, new, state, called, the, united, kingdom, of, great, britain, and, ireland, which, united, great, britain, with, the, kingdom, of, ireland, to, form, a, single, political, entity, the, english, parliament, at, westminster, became, the, parliament, of, the, union, following, the, formation, of, great, britain, the, history, of, england, is, no, longer, the, history, of, a, sovereign, nation, but, rather, the, history, of, one, of, the, countries, of, the, united, kingdom, in, the, late, 18th, and, early, 19th, centuries, technological, advances, and, mechanisation, resulted, in, the, industrial, revolution, which, transformed, a, largely, agrarian, society, and, caused, considerable, social, upheaval, economies, of, scale, and, increased, output, per, worker, allowed, steam, based, factories, to, undercut, production, of, traditional, cottage, industries, much, of, the, agricultural, workforce, was, uprooted, from, the, countryside, and, moved, into, large, urban, centres, of, production, the, consequent, overcrowding, into, areas, with, little, supporting, infrastructure, saw, dramatic, increases, in, mortality, crime, and, social, deprivation, many, sunday, schools, for, pre, working, age, children, 5, or, 6, had, funeral, clubs, to, pay, for, each, other, s, funeral, arrangements, the, process, of, industrialisation, threatened, many, livelihoods, which, prompted, some, to, sabotage, factories, these, saboteurs, were, known, as, luddites, the, local, government, act, 1888, was, the, first, systematic, attempt, to, impose, a, standardised, system, of, local, government, in, england, the, system, was, based, on, the, existing, counties, today, known, as, the, historic, counties, since, the, major, boundary, changes, of, 1974, later, the, local, government, act, 1894, created, a, second, tier, of, local, government, all, administrative, counties, and, county, boroughs, were, divided, into, either, rural, or, urban, districts, allowing, more, localised, administration, during, the, 1800s, the, need, for, local, administration, greatly, increased, prompting, piecemeal, adjustments, the, sanitary, districts, and, parish, councils, had, legal, status, but, were, not, part, of, the, mechanism, of, government, they, were, run, by, volunteers, often, no, one, could, be, held, responsible, for, the, failure, to, undertake, the, required, duties, furthermore, the, increased, county, business, could, not, be, handled, by, the, quarter, sessions, nor, was, this, appropriate, finally, there, was, a, desire, to, see, local, administration, performed, by, elected, officials, as, in, the, reformed, municipal, boroughs, by, 1888, these, shortcomings, were, clear, and, the, local, government, act, was, the, first, systematic, attempt, to, create, a, standardised, system, of, local, government, in, england, the, system, was, based, on, the, existing, counties, now, known, as, the, historic, counties, since, the, major, boundary, changes, of, 1974, the, counties, themselves, had, had, some, boundary, changes, in, the, preceding, 50, years, mainly, to, remove, enclaves, and, exclaves, the, act, called, for, the, creation, of, statutory, counties, based, on, the, ancient, historic, counties, but, completely, corrected, for, enclaves, and, exclaves, and, adjusted, so, that, each, settlement, was, completely, within, one, county, these, statutory, counties, were, to, be, used, for, non, administrative, functions, sheriff, lieutenant, custos, rotulorum, justices, militia, coroner, or, other, with, the, advent, of, elected, councils, the, offices, of, lord, lieutenant, and, sheriff, became, largely, ceremonial, the, statutory, counties, formed, the, basis, for, the, so, called, administrative, counties, however, it, was, felt, that, large, cities, and, primarily, rural, areas, in, the, same, county, could, not, be, well, administered, by, the, same, body, thus, 59, counties, in, themselves, or, county, boroughs, were, created, to, administer, the, urban, centres, of, england, these, were, part, of, the, statutory, counties, but, not, part, of, the, administrative, counties, in, 1894, the, local, government, act, created, a, second, tier, of, local, government, henceforth, all, administrative, counties, and, county, boroughs, would, be, divided, into, either, rural, or, urban, districts, allowing, more, localised, administration, the, municipal, boroughs, reformed, after, 1835, were, brought, into, this, system, as, special, cases, of, urban, districts, the, urban, and, rural, districts, were, based, on, and, incorporated, the, sanitary, districts, which, created, in, 1875, with, adjustments, so, that, districts, did, not, overlap, two, counties, the, act, also, provided, for, the, establishment, of, civil, parishes, the, 1894, act, formed, an, official, system, of, civil, parishes, separated, from, the, ecclesiastical, parishes, to, carry, on, some, of, these, responsibilities, others, being, transferred, to, the, district, county, councils, however, the, civil, parishes, were, not, a, complete, third, tier, of, local, government, instead, they, were, community, councils, for, smaller, rural, settlements, which, did, not, have, a, local, government, district, to, themselves, where, urban, parish, councils, had, previously, existed, they, were, absorbed, into, the, new, urban, districts, a, prolonged, agricultural, depression, in, britain, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, together, with, the, introduction, in, the, 20th, century, of, increasingly, heavy, levels, of, taxation, on, inherited, wealth, put, an, end, to, agricultural, land, as, the, primary, source, of, wealth, for, the, upper, classes, many, estates, were, sold, or, broken, up, and, this, trend, was, accelerated, by, the, introduction, of, protection, for, agricultural, tenancies, encouraging, outright, sales, from, the, mid, 20th, century, following, years, of, political, and, military, agitation, for, home, rule, for, ireland, the, anglo, irish, treaty, of, 1921, established, the, irish, free, state, now, the, republic, of, ireland, as, a, separate, state, leaving, northern, ireland, as, part, of, the, united, kingdom, the, country, s, official, name, thus, became, the, united, kingdom, of, great, britain, and, northern, ireland, england, as, part, of, the, uk, joined, the, european, economic, community, in, 1973, which, became, the, european, union, in, 1993, the, uk, left, the, eu, in, 2020, there, is, a, movement, in, england, to, create, a, devolved, english, parliament, this, would, give, england, a, local, parliament, like, those, already, functioning, for, scotland, northern, ireland, and, wales, this, issue, is, referred, to, as, the, west, lothian, question, a, local, government, commission, was, wound, up, in, 1966, and, replaced, with, a, royal, commission, known, as, the, redcliffe, maud, commission, in, 1969, it, recommended, a, system, of, single, tier, unitary, authorities, for, the, whole, of, england, apart, from, three, metropolitan, areas, of, merseyside, selnec, greater, manchester, and, west, midlands, birmingham, and, the, black, country, which, were, to, have, both, a, metropolitan, council, and, district, councils, this, report, was, accepted, by, the, labour, party, government, of, the, time, despite, considerable, opposition, but, the, conservative, party, won, the, june, 1970, general, election, and, on, a, manifesto, that, committed, them, to, a, two, tier, structure, the, reforms, arising, from, the, local, government, act, of, 1972, resulted, in, the, most, uniform, and, simplified, system, of, local, government, which, has, been, used, in, england, they, effectively, wiped, away, everything, that, had, gone, before, and, built, an, administrative, system, from, scratch, all, previous, administrative, districts, statutory, counties, administrative, counties, county, boroughs, municipal, boroughs, counties, corporate, civil, parishes, were, abolished, the, aim, of, the, act, was, to, establish, a, uniform, two, tier, system, across, the, country, onto, the, blank, canvas, new, counties, were, created, to, cover, the, entire, country, many, of, these, were, obviously, based, on, the, historic, counties, but, there, were, some, major, changes, especially, in, the, north, this, uniform, two, tier, system, lasted, only, 12, years, in, 1986, the, metropolitan, county, councils, and, greater, london, were, abolished, this, restored, autonomy, in, effect, the, old, county, borough, status, to, the, metropolitan, and, london, boroughs, the, local, government, act, 1992, established, a, commission, local, government, commission, for, england, to, examine, the, issues, and, make, recommendations, on, where, unitary, authorities, should, be, established, it, was, considered, too, expensive, to, make, the, system,
