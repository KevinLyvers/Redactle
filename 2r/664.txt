the, history, of, transport, is, largely, one, of, technological, innovation, advances, in, technology, have, allowed, people, to, travel, farther, explore, more, territory, and, expand, their, influence, over, larger, and, larger, areas, even, in, ancient, times, new, tools, such, as, foot, coverings, skis, and, snowshoes, lengthened, the, distances, that, could, be, traveled, as, new, inventions, and, discoveries, were, applied, to, transport, problems, travel, time, decreased, while, the, ability, to, move, more, and, larger, loads, increased, innovation, continues, as, transport, researchers, are, working, to, find, new, ways, to, reduce, costs, and, increase, transport, efficiency, international, trade, was, the, driving, motivator, behind, advancements, in, global, transportation, in, the, pre, modern, world, there, was, a, single, global, world, economy, with, a, worldwide, division, of, labor, and, multilateral, trade, from, 1500, onward, the, sale, and, transportation, of, textiles, silver, and, gold, spices, slaves, and, luxury, goods, throughout, afro, eurasia, and, later, the, new, world, would, see, an, evolution, in, overland, and, sea, trade, routes, and, travel, the, first, earth, tracks, were, created, by, humans, carrying, goods, and, often, followed, trails, tracks, would, be, naturally, created, at, points, of, high, traffic, density, as, animals, were, domesticated, horses, oxen, and, donkeys, became, an, element, in, track, creation, with, the, growth, of, trade, tracks, were, often, flattened, or, widened, to, accommodate, animal, traffic, hollow, way, or, drover, s, road, later, the, travois, a, frame, used, to, drag, loads, was, developed, animal, drawn, wheeled, vehicles, were, probably, developed, in, the, ancient, near, east, in, the, 4th, or, 5th, millennium, bc, and, spread, to, europe, and, india, in, the, 4th, millennium, bc, and, china, in, about, 1200, bc, the, romans, had, a, significant, need, for, good, roads, to, extend, and, maintain, their, empire, and, developed, roman, roads, in, the, industrial, revolution, john, loudon, mcadam, 1756, 1836, designed, the, first, modern, highways, using, inexpensive, paving, material, of, soil, and, stone, aggregate, macadam, and, the, embanked, roads, a, few, feet, higher, than, the, surrounding, terrain, to, cause, water, to, drain, away, from, the, surface, with, the, development, of, motor, transport, starting, in, 1886, in, germany, and, in, the, u, s, in, 1908, with, the, production, of, ford, s, first, model, t, there, was, an, increased, need, for, hard, topped, roads, to, reduce, washaways, bogging, and, dust, on, both, urban, and, rural, roads, originally, using, cobblestones, and, wooden, paving, in, major, western, cities, and, in, the, early, 20th, century, tar, bound, macadam, tarmac, and, concrete, paving, in, 1902, nottingham, s, radcliffe, road, became, the, first, tarmac, road, in, the, world, the, history, of, rail, transportation, dates, back, nearly, 500, years, and, includes, systems, with, man, or, horsepower, and, rails, of, wood, or, occasionally, stone, this, was, usually, for, moving, coal, from, the, mine, down, to, a, river, from, where, it, could, continue, by, boat, with, a, flanged, wheel, running, on, a, rail, the, use, of, cast, iron, plates, as, rails, began, in, the, 1760s, and, was, followed, by, systems, plateways, where, the, flange, was, part, of, the, rail, however, with, the, introduction, of, rolled, wrought, iron, rails, these, became, obsolete, the, first, passenger, carrying, public, railway, was, opened, by, the, swansea, and, mumbles, railway, at, oystermouth, in, 1807, using, horse, drawn, carriages, on, existing, tramlines, in, 1802, richard, trevithick, designed, and, built, the, first, unnamed, steam, locomotive, to, run, on, smooth, rails, he, was, a, cornish, engineer, and, showed, off, his, railway, invention, in, the, welsh, mining, town, of, merthyr, tydfil, before, actual, making, the, breakthrough, for, the, first, railway, engine, trevithick, had, been, facing, failures, and, successes, along, the, route, one, of, his, first, successful, demonstrations, was, the, puffing, devil, steam, powered, locomotive, in, 1802, whereas, a, disaster, in, greenwich, in, 1803, almost, sealed, the, fate, of, locomotive, travel, when, four, men, were, killed, by, an, explosion, of, one, of, trevithick, s, engines, this, incident, was, used, as, a, leverage, by, his, rivals, to, stop, the, production, of, the, high, pressure, steam, engines, however, trevithick, s, penydarren, locomotive, marked, its, place, in, history, by, becoming, the, first, full, scale, working, railway, steam, locomotive, a, bet, between, trevithick, s, benefactor, samuel, homfray, and, richard, crawshay, prompted, the, key, demonstration, of, the, locomotive, homfray, had, placed, a, wager, of, 500, guineas, that, the, locomotive, will, transport, ten, tonnes, of, iron, from, the, pendydarren, ironworks, to, the, village, of, abercynon, which, was, nearly, ten, miles, away, trevithick, s, locomotive, completed, the, journey, in, just, over, four, hours, ultimately, proving, the, locomotives, sturdiness, and, reliability, however, trevithick, never, got, the, credit, he, deserved, and, died, a, destitute, in, 1833, modern, rail, transport, systems, first, appeared, in, england, in, the, 1820s, matthew, murray, proved, the, viability, of, the, steam, engine, in, 1812, salamanca, was, the, first, locomotive, to, incorporate, two, cylinders, george, stephenson, who, went, on, to, become, known, as, the, father, of, railways, is, said, to, have, built, 16, experimental, locomotives, for, use, from, the, year, 1814, 1826, the, last, train, which, he, introduced, known, as, the, killingworth, billy, ran, until, 1881, the, first, intercity, railway, between, liverpool, and, manchester, was, built, by, stephenson, in, 1830, these, systems, which, made, use, of, the, steam, locomotive, were, the, first, practical, form, of, mechanized, land, transport, and, they, remained, the, primary, form, of, mechanized, land, transport, for, the, next, 100, years, the, first, railroad, built, in, great, britain, was, the, stockton, and, darlington, which, opened, in, 1825, it, used, a, steam, locomotive, built, by, george, stephenson, and, was, practical, only, for, hauling, minerals, the, liverpool, and, manchester, railway, which, opened, in, 1830, was, the, first, modern, railroad, it, was, a, public, carrier, of, both, passengers, and, freight, by, 1870, britain, had, about, 13, 500, miles, 21, 700, km, of, railroad, in, 1879, electric, locomotive, development, was, booming, in, germany, in, the, late, 19th, century, werner, von, siemens, demonstrated, the, first, experimental, electric, passenger, train, the, train, transported, around, 90, 000, people, and, worked, on, the, concept, of, insulated, third, rail, to, supply, electricity, in, 1881, siemens, built, the, world, s, first, electric, tram, line, in, the, berlin, suburb, of, lichterfelde, following, this, trend, many, such, initiatives, were, set, up, in, brighton, and, vienna, in, 1883, diesel, locomotives, a, new, type, of, railway, locomotives, was, developed, by, dr, rudolf, diesel, which, involved, a, new, internal, combustion, method, to, propel, the, railway, in, 1892, he, proposed, this, method, and, soon, sparked, speculation, on, whether, this, type, of, engine, would, actually, work, from, the, late, 19th, century, to, the, early, 20th, century, rudolf, diesel, worked, on, putting, diesel, on, track, and, tried, to, improve, the, power, to, weight, ratio, he, worked, at, a, swiss, engineering, firm, sulzer, eventually, by, the, end, of, the, second, world, war, steam, engines, became, obsolete, and, were, rarely, used, in, developed, countries, at, the, system, s, greatest, extent, in, 1914, there, were, about, 20, 000, miles, 32, 000, km, of, the, track, run, by, 120, competing, companies, the, british, government, combined, all, these, companies, into, four, main, groups, in, 1923, as, an, economic, measure, british, railways, by, name, british, rail, the, former, national, railway, system, of, great, britain, was, created, by, the, transport, act, 1947, which, inaugurated, public, ownership, of, the, railways, the, history, of, rail, transport, also, includes, the, history, of, rapid, transit, and, arguably, history, of, monorail, in, the, stone, age, primitive, boats, developed, to, permit, navigation, of, rivers, and, for, fishing, in, rivers, and, off, the, coast, it, has, been, argued, that, boats, suitable, for, a, significant, sea, crossing, were, necessary, for, people, to, reach, australia, an, estimated, 40, 000, 45, 000, years, ago, with, the, development, of, civilization, vessels, evolved, for, expansion, and, generally, grew, in, size, for, trade, and, war, in, the, mediterranean, galleys, were, developed, about, 3000, bc, polynesian, double, hulled, sailing, vessels, with, advanced, rigging, were, used, between, 1, 300, bc, and, 900, bc, by, the, polynesian, progeny, of, the, lapita, culture, to, expand, 6, 000, km, across, open, ocean, from, the, bismarck, archipelago, east, to, micronesia, and, eventually, hawaii, galleys, were, eventually, rendered, obsolete, by, ocean, going, sailing, ships, such, as, the, iberian, caravel, in, the, 14th, century, the, chinese, treasure, ship, in, the, early, 15th, century, and, the, mediterranean, man, of, war, in, the, late, 15th, century, in, the, industrial, revolution, the, first, steamboats, and, later, diesel, powered, ships, were, developed, eventually, submarines, were, developed, mainly, for, military, purposes, for, people, s, general, benefit, meanwhile, specialized, craft, were, developed, for, river, and, canal, transport, canals, were, developed, in, mesopotamia, c, 4000, bc, the, indus, valley, civilization, in, pakistan, and, north, india, from, c, 2600, bc, had, the, first, canal, irrigation, system, in, the, world, china, s, canal, system, whose, greatest, accomplishment, was, the, sui, dynasty, s, 1, 794, kilometer, 1, 115, mi, 7th, century, grand, canal, between, hangzhou, and, beijing, was, an, essential, aspect, of, its, civilization, used, for, irrigation, flood, control, taxation, commercial, and, military, transport, and, colonization, of, new, lands, from, the, zhou, dynasty, until, the, end, of, the, imperial, era, canals, were, developed, in, the, middle, ages, in, europe, in, venice, and, the, netherlands, ramps, for, water, were, made, in, 1459, pierre, paul, riquet, began, to, organise, the, construction, of, the, 240, km, long, canal, du, midi, in, france, in, 1665, and, it, was, opened, in, 1681, in, the, industrial, revolution, inland, canals, were, built, in, england, and, later, the, united, states, before, the, development, of, railways, specialized, craft, were, also, developed, for, fishing, and, later, whaling, maritime, history, also, deals, with, the, development, of, navigation, oceanography, cartography, and, hydrography, often, cities, as, well, as, their, surrounding, agricultural, areas, are, typically, are, not, self, sufficient, for, agriculture, because, of, this, people, living, in, these, regions, had, forced, to, trade, with, either, other, cities, nomads, or, other, pastoralists, people, would, usually, trade, one, another, for, things, like, raw, materials, such, as, metals, like, tin, bronze, copper, or, iron, ore, or, animals, an, intercontinental, model, of, world, trade, between, 1500, and, 1800, on, the, basis, of, interregional, competition, in, production, and, trade, was, proposed, by, frederic, mauro, but, the, early, existence, of, it, was, already, observed, by, dudley, north, in, the, year, 1691, this, world, market, of, trade, as, well, as, the, flow, of, finances, throughout, spanned, out, an, interconnected, throughout, the, entire, globe, permitted, the, intersectoral, and, intersectional, regional, divisions, of, both, generated, competition, and, labor, through, the, water, frontier, many, people, throughout, history, have, traveled, by, water, as, much, as, they, have, by, land, along, with, this, quite, a, large, number, of, individuals, relied, on, the, sea, and, maritime, trade, raiding, piracy, or, smuggling, for, survival, littoral, peoples, reflecting, symbiosis, of, both, land, and, sea, would, often, have, more, in, common, with, one, another, than, they, would, with, their, neighboring, islands, throughout, centuries, in, the, past, water, supplied, the, cheapest, and, sometimes, the, only, means, of, transporting, bulk, materials, on, a, large, scale, and, it, was, also, the, most, secure, way, to, ensure, transport, over, long, distances, because, of, this, the, proximity, of, the, sea, drew, southeast, asians, to, participate, in, long, distance, trade, but, it, was, not, only, water, that, linked, the, shores, to, one, another, seafaring, people, along, with, traders, contributed, to, these, trade, routes, as, well, maritime, traders, most, often, congregated, in, ports, which, were, considered, the, point, in, which, land, and, sea, met, that, linked, the, hinterland, to, the, wider, world, there, were, some, ports, that, were, more, favored, than, others, blessed, with, a, good, location, with, sufficient, warehouse, facilities, accessible, harbors, and, adequate, supplies, of, food, and, water, became, entrep, ts, which, were, essentially, the, super, centers, for, trade, it, was, rare, that, these, ports, were, ever, considered, a, final, destination, though, but, rather, central, meeting, points, in, what, was, an, ever, changing, economic, and, political, environment, whether, in, asia, europe, or, africa, these, port, centers, consisted, of, ethnically, and, culturally, diverse, communities, many, had, officials, that, were, of, foreign, birth, or, ancestry, they, were, skilled, in, being, knowledgeable, of, the, various, cultures, and, languages, of, merchants, that, would, work, throughout, the, ports, who, were, also, foreign, this, was, done, in, order, to, be, successful, in, supervising, the, trade, that, had, occurred, throughout, many, of, the, ports, merchants, had, become, a, more, powerful, group, in, local, politics, further, these, ports, promoted, cultural, exchange, along, with, economic, exchange, due, to, the, fact, that, it, had, been, open, to, the, world, for, races, cultures, and, ideas, to, intermix, with, one, another, along, with, the, fact, that, this, blend, of, both, locals, and, outsiders, from, diverse, backgrounds, that, were, open, to, accepting, cultural, differences, nation, building, and, modernity, reduced, the, role, of, trade, through, the, sea, and, increased, the, reliance, on, trade, through, the, land, and, the, air, in, economic, and, social, exchange, even, though, singapore, bangkok, and, hong, kong, are, still, vibrant, and, available, to, the, world, similar, to, their, early, modern, counterparts, serving, functions, such, as, tourism, which, is, unrelated, to, foreign, trade, only, a, few, ports, are, as, economically, crucial, today, as, they, had, been, in, the, past, inland, trade, moved, both, by, water, and, overland, itself, for, example, shipping, in, small, boats, went, along, the, coasts, of, india, but, inland, waterways, were, readily, available, to, use, to, transport, goods, throughout, many, parts, of, india, especially, in, the, south, caravans, that, contained, numbers, from, ten, all, the, way, to, up, forty, thousand, pack, or, draft, animals, moved, overland, at, a, time, combinations, of, these, forms, of, transportation, carried, throughout, the, subcontinent, and, were, therefore, transshipped, to, and, from, long, distance, maritime, trade, the, majority, of, all, of, the, port, cities, were, in, symbiosis, with, the, caravan, routes, to, and, from, their, related, hinterland, interiors, and, sometimes, even, with, distant, transcontinental, regions, this, is, especially, true, in, central, asia, and, it, is, suggested, that, the, continental, trade, over, both, the, land, and, the, ocean, maritime, trade, should, be, viewed, not, as, separate, or, competitive, but, rather, as, mirror, images, of, one, another, humanity, s, desire, to, fly, likely, dates, to, the, first, time, man, observed, birds, an, observation, illustrated, in, the, legendary, stories, of, daedalus, and, icarus, in, greek, mythology, and, the, vimanas, in, indian, mythology, much, of, the, focus, of, early, research, was, on, imitating, birds, but, through, trial, and, error, balloons, airships, gliders, and, eventually, powered, aircraft, and, other, types, of, flying, machines, were, invented, kites, were, the, first, form, of, man, made, flying, objects, and, early, records, suggest, that, kites, were, around, before, 200, bc, in, china, leonardo, da, vinci, s, dream, of, flight, found, expression, in, several, designs, but, he, did, not, attempt, to, demonstrate, flight, by, literally, constructing, them, during, the, 17th, and, 18th, century, when, scientists, began, analysing, the, earth, s, atmosphere, gases, such, as, hydrogen, were, discovered, which, in, turn, led, to, the, invention, of, hydrogen, balloons, various, theories, in, mechanics, by, physicists, during, the, same, period, of, time, notably, fluid, dynamics, and, newton, s, laws, of, motion, led, to, the, foundation, of, modern, aerodynamics, tethered, balloons, filled, with, hot, air, were, used, in, the, first, half, of, the, 19th, century, and, saw, considerable, action, in, several, mid, century, wars, most, notably, the, american, civil, war, where, balloons, provided, observation, during, the, siege, of, petersburg, apart, from, some, scattered, reference, in, ancient, and, medieval, records, resting, on, slender, evidence, and, in, need, of, interpretation, the, earliest, clearly, verifiable, human, flight, took, place, in, paris, in, 1783, when, jean, fran, ois, pil, tre, de, rozier, and, fran, ois, laurent, d, arlandes, went, 5, miles, 8, 0, km, in, a, hot, air, balloon, invented, by, the, montgolfier, brothers, the, wright, brothers, made, the, first, sustained, controlled, and, powered, heavier, than, air, flight, on, 17, december, 1903, in, their, revolutionary, aircraft, the, wright, flyer, world, war, ii, saw, a, drastic, increase, in, the, pace, of, aircraft, development, and, production, all, countries, involved, in, the, war, stepped, up, development, and, production, of, aircraft, and, flight, based, weapon, delivery, systems, such, as, the, first, long, range, bomber, after, the, war, ended, commercial, aviation, grew, rapidly, using, mostly, ex, military, aircraft, to, transport, people, and, cargo, this, growth, was, accelerated, by, the, glut, of, heavy, and, super, heavy, bomber, airframes, like, the, lancaster, that, could, be, converted, into, commercial, aircraft, the, first, commercial, jet, airliner, to, fly, was, the, british, de, havilland, comet, this, marked, the, beginning, of, the, jet, age, a, period, of, relatively, cheap, and, fast, international, travel, in, the, beginning, of, the, 21st, century, subsonic, military, aviation, focused, on, eliminating, the, pilot, in, favor, of, remotely, operated, or, completely, autonomous, vehicles, several, unmanned, aerial, vehicles, or, uavs, have, been, developed, in, april, 2001, the, unmanned, aircraft, global, hawk, flew, from, edwards, afb, in, the, us, to, australia, non, stop, and, unrefueled, this, is, the, longest, point, to, point, flight, ever, undertaken, by, an, unmanned, aircraft, and, took, 23, hours, and, 23, minutes, in, october, 2003, the, first, totally, autonomous, flight, across, the, atlantic, by, a, computer, controlled, model, aircraft, occurred, major, disruptions, to, air, travel, in, the, 21st, century, included, the, closing, of, u, s, airspace, following, the, september, 11, attacks, the, closing, of, northern, european, airspace, after, the, 2010, eruptions, of, eyjafjallaj, kull, and, the, covid, 19, pandemic, the, realistic, dream, of, spaceflight, dated, back, to, konstantin, tsiolkovsky, however, tsiolkovsky, wrote, in, russian, and, this, was, not, widely, influential, outside, russia, spaceflight, became, an, engineering, possibility, with, the, work, of, robert, h, goddard, s, publication, in, 1919, of, his, paper, robert, h, goddard, a, method, of, reaching, extreme, altitudes, where, his, application, of, the, de, laval, nozzle, to, liquid, propellant, rockets, gave, sufficient, power, that, interplanetary, travel, became, possible, this, paper, was, highly, influential, on, hermann, oberth, and, wernher, von, braun, later, key, players, in, spaceflight, the, first, human, spaceflight, was, achieved, with, the, soviet, space, program, s, vostok, 1, mission, in, 1961, the, lead, architects, behind, the, mission, were, sergei, korolev, and, kerim, kerimov, with, yuri, gagarin, being, the, first, astronaut, on, may, 5, 1961, the, us, launched, its, first, suborbital, mercury, astronaut, alan, shepard, in, the, freedom, 7, capsule, unlike, gagarin, shepard, manually, controlled, his, spacecraft, s, attitude, and, landed, inside, it, hence, making, his, mission, the, first, completed, human, spaceflight, according, to, previous, fai, definitions, kerimov, later, went, on, to, launch, the, first, space, docks, kosmos, 186, and, kosmos, 188, in, 1967, and, the, first, space, stations, salyut, and, mir, series, from, 1971, to, 1991, the, first, spaceflight, to, the, moon, was, achieved, with, nasa, s, apollo, 11, mission, in, 1969, with, neil, armstrong, and, buzz, aldrin, being, the, first, astronauts, on, the, moon, the, thirteenth, century, saw, the, rise, of, the, magnetic, compass, for, overseas, travel, prior, to, its, creation, seamen, would, have, to, rely, on, landmarks, and, stars, as, guides, for, navigation, the, compass, allowed, sailors, to, plot, a, course, and, using, magnetic, north, as, a, reference, could, travel, through, fog, and, overcast, this, also, led, to, shorter, voyages, as, they, could, plot, more, linear, approaches, to, destinations, portolan, charts, rose, up, plotting, this, linear, excursion, routes, making, sea, navigation, more, accurate, and, efficient, in, 1761, marine, chronometer, was, invented
