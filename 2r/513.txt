despite, sustained, tensions, the, republic, of, china, did, not, consider, itself, to, be, in, an, ongoing, war, with, japan, over, these, six, years, it, is, also, referred, to, as, part, of, the, global, anti, fascist, war, in, japan, nowadays, the, name, japan, china, war, japanese, romanized, nitch, sens, is, most, commonly, used, because, of, its, perceived, objectivity, when, the, invasion, of, china, proper, began, in, earnest, in, july, 1937, near, beijing, the, government, of, japan, used, the, north, china, incident, japanese, romanized, hokushi, jihen, kahoku, jihen, and,

jihen, was, used, by, japan, as, neither, country, had, made, a, formal, declaration, of, war, from, the, japanese, perspective, localizing, these, conflicts, was, beneficial, in, preventing,

although, the, japanese, government, still, uses, the, term, china, incident, in, formal, documents, the, word, shina, is, considered, derogatory, by, china, and, therefore, the, media, in, japan, often, paraphrase, with, other, expressions, like, the, japan, china, incident, japanese, romanized, nikka, jiken, nisshi, jiken, which, were, used, by, media, as, early, as, the, 1930s, the, name,

the, end, of, the, war, japan, had, also, attempted, to, annex, the, liaodong, peninsula, following, the, war, though, was, forced, to, return, it, to, china, following, an, intervention, by, france, germany, and, russia, the, qing, dynasty, was, on, the, brink, of, collapse, due, to, internal, revolts, and, the, imposition, of, the, unequal, treaties, while, japan, had, emerged, as, a, great, power, through, its, modernization, measures, in, 1905, japan, successfully, defeated, the, russian, empire, in, the, russo, japanese, war, gaining, tailen, and, southern, sakhalin, and, establishing,

government, was, a, civilian, government, in, name, but, in, practice, it, was, a, military, dictatorship, with, a, different, warlord, controlling, each, province, of, the, country, china, was, reduced, to, a, fractured, state, as, a, result, china, s, prosperity, began, to, wither, and, its, economy, declined, this, instability, presented, an, opportunity, for, nationalistic, politicians, in, japan, to, press, for, territorial, expansion, in, 1915, japan, issued, the, twenty, one, demands, to, extort, further, political, and, commercial, privilege, from, china, which, was, accepted, by, the, regime, of, yuan, shikai, following, world, war, i, japan, acquired, the, german, empire, s, sphere, of, influence, in, shandong, province, leading, to, nationwide, anti, japanese, protests,

worsened, as, a, result, of, the, jinan, incident, as, the, national, revolutionary, army, approached, beijing, zhang, zuolin, decided, to, retreat, back, to, manchuria, before, he, was, assassinated, by, the, kwantung, army, in, 1928, his, son, zhang, xueliang, took, over, as, the, leader, of, the, fengtian, clique, in, manchuria, later, in, the, same, year, zhang, declared, his, allegiance, to, the, nationalist, government, in, nanjing, under, chiang, kai, shek, and, consequently, china, was, nominally, reunified, under, one, government, the, july, november, 1929, conflict, over, the, chinese, eastern, railroad, cer, further, increased, the, tensions, in, the, northeast, that, led, to, the, mukden, incident, and, eventually, the, second, sino, japanese, war, the, soviet, red, army, victory, over, xueliang, s, forces, not, only, reasserted, soviet, control, over, the, cer, in, manchuria, but, revealed, chinese, military, weaknesses, that, japanese, kwantung, army, officers, were,

communists, through, the, encirclement, campaigns, following, the, policy, of, first, internal, pacification, then, external, resistance, chinese, the, internecine, warfare, in, china, provided, excellent, opportunities, for, japan, which, saw, manchuria, as, a, limitless, supply, of, raw, materials, a, market, for, its, manufactured, goods, now, excluded, from, the, markets, of, many, western, countries, as, a, result, of, depression, era, tariffs, and, a, protective, buffer, state, against, the, soviet, union, in, siberia, as, a, result, the, japanese, army, was, widely, prevalent, in, manchuria, immediately, following, the, japanese, victory, in, the, russo, japanese, war, in, 1905, where, japan, gained, significant, territory, in, manchuria, as, a, result, of,

was, simply, protecting, its, own, economic, interests, however, militarists, in, the, japanese, army, began, pushing, for, an, expansion, of, influence, leading, to, the, japanese, army, assassinating, the, warlord, of, manchuria, zhang, zuolin, this, was, done, with, hopes, that, it, would, start, a, crisis, that, would, allow, japan, to, expand, their, power, and, influence, in, the, region, when, this, was, not, as, successful, as, they, desired, japan, then, decided, to, invade, manchuria, outright, after, the, mukden, incident, in, september, 1931, japanese, soldiers, set, off, a, bomb, on, the, southern, manchurian, railroad, in, order, to, provoke, an, opportunity, to, act, in, self, defense, and, invade, outright, japan, charged, that, its, rights, in, manchuria,

china, 69, incessant, fighting, followed, the, mukden, incident, in, 1932, chinese, and, japanese, troops, fought, the, january, 28, incident, battle, this, resulted, in, the, demilitarization, of, shanghai, which, forbade, the, chinese, to, deploy, troops, in, their, own, city, in, manchukuo, there, was, an, ongoing, campaign, to, defeat, the, anti, japanese, volunteer, armies, that, arose, from, widespread, outrage, over, the, policy, of, non, resistance, to, japan, on, 15, april, 1932, the, chinese, soviet, republic, led, by, the, communists, declared, war, on, japan, in, 1933, the,

limited, to, just, the, area, of, the, yangtze, river, delta, other, sections, of, china, were, essentially, in, the, hands, of, local, chinese, warlords, japan, sought, various, chinese, collaborators, and, helped, them, establish, governments, friendly, to, japan, this, policy, was, called, the, specialization, of, north, china, chinese, pinyin, hu, b, it, sh, h, a, more, commonly, known, as, the, north, china, autonomous, movement, the, northern, provinces, affected, by, this, policy, were, chahar, suiyuan, hebei, shanxi, and, shandong, this, japanese, policy, was, most, effective, in, the, area, of, what, is, now, inner, mongolia, and, hebei, in, 1935, under, japanese, pressure, china, signed, the, he, umezu, agreement, which, forbade, the, kmt, to, conduct, party, operations, in, hebei, in, the, same, year, the, chin, doihara, agreement, was, signed, expelling, the, kmt, from, chahar, thus, by, the, end, of, 1935, the, chinese, government, had, essentially, abandoned, northern, china, in, its, place, the, japanese, backed, east, hebei, autonomous, council, and, the, hebei, chahar, political, council, were, established, there, in, the, empty, space, of,

resist, japanese, aggression, in, manchuria, and, chahar, and, suiyuan, some, chinese, historians, believe, the, 18, september, 1931, japanese, invasion, of, manchuria, marks, the, start, of, the, war, of, resistance, although, not, the, conventional, western, view, british, historian, rana, mitter, describes, this, chinese, trend, of, historical, analysis, as, perfectly, reasonable, in, 2017, the, chinese, government, officially, announced, that, it, would, adopt, this, view, under, this, interpretation, the, 1931, 1937, period, is, viewed, as, the, partial, war, while, 1937, 1945, is, a, period, of, total, war, this, view, of, a, fourteen, year, war, has, political, significance, because, it, provides, more, recognition, for, the, role, of, northeast, china, in, the, war, of, resistance, on, the, night, of, 7, july, 1937, chinese, and, japanese, troops, exchanged, fire, in, the, vicinity, of, the, marco, polo, or, lugou, bridge, a, crucial, access, route, to, beijing,

japanese, at, battle, of, suixian, zaoyang, 1st, battle, of, changsha, battle, of, south, guangxi, and, battle, of, zaoyi, these, outcomes, encouraged, the, chinese, to, launch, their, first, large, scale, counter, offensive, against, the, ija, in, early, 1940, however, due, to, its, low, military, industrial, capacity, and, limited, experience, in, modern, warfare, this, offensive, was, defeated, afterwards, chiang, could, not, risk, any, more, all, out, offensive, campaigns, given, the, poorly, trained, under, equipped, and, disorganized, state, of, his, armies, and, opposition, to,

territories, and, tried, to, solve, their, occupation, problems, by, implementing, a, strategy, of, creating, friendly, puppet, governments, favourable, to, japanese, interests, in, the, territories, conquered, most, prominently, the, wang, jingwei, government, headed, by, former, kmt, premier, wang, jingwei, however, atrocities, committed, by, the, imperial, japanese, army, as, well, as, japanese, refusal, to, delegate, any, real, power, left, the, puppets, very, unpopular, and, largely, ineffective, the, only, success, the, japanese, had, was, to, recruit, a, large, collaborationist, chinese, army, to, maintain, public, security, in, the, occupied, areas, by, 1941, japan, held, most, of, the, eastern, coastal, areas, of, china, and, vietnam, but, guerrilla, fighting, continued, in, these, occupied, areas, japan, had, suffered, high, casualties, which, resulted, from, unexpectedly, stubborn, chinese, resistance, and, neither, side, could, make, any, swift, progress, in, the, manner, of, nazi, germany, in, western, europe, by, 1943, guangdong, had, experienced, famine, as, the, situation, worsened, new, york, chinese, compatriots, received, a, letter, stating, that, 600, 000, people, were, killed, in, siyi, by, starvation, the, basis, of, chinese, strategy, before, the, entrance, of, the, western, allies, can, be, divided, into, two, periods, as, follows, unlike, japan, china, was, unprepared, for, total, war, and, had, little, military, industrial, strength, no, mechanized, divisions, and, few, armoured, forces, up, until, the, mid, 1930s, china, had, hoped, that, the, league, of, nations, would, provide, countermeasures, to, japan, s, aggression, during, this, period, the, main, chinese, objective, was, to, drag, out, the, war, for, as, long, as, possible, in, a, war, of, attrition, thereby, exhausting, japanese, resources, while, it, was, building, up, china, s, military, capacity, american, general, joseph, stilwell, called, this, strategy, winning, by, outlasting, the, nra, adopted, the, concept, of, magnetic, warfare, to, attract, advancing, japanese, troops, to, definite, points, where, they, were, subjected, to, ambush, flanking, attacks, and, encirclements, in, major, engagements, the, most, prominent, example, of, this, tactic, was, the, successful, defense, of, changsha, in, 1939, and, again, in, the, 1941, battle, in, which, heavy, casualties, were, inflicted, on, the, ija, local, chinese, resistance, forces, organized, separately, by, both, the, ccp, and, the, kmt, continued, their, resistance, in, occupied, areas, to, make, japanese, administration, over, the, vast, land, area, of, china, difficult, in, 1940, the, chinese, red, army, launched, a, major, offensive, in, north, china, destroying, railways, and, a, major, coal, mine, these, constant, guerilla, and, sabotage, operations, deeply, frustrated, the, imperial, japanese, army, and, they, led, them, to, employ, the, three, alls, policy, kill, all, loot, all, burn, all, hanyu, pinyin, s, ngu, ng, zh, ngc, japanese, on, sank, seisaku, it, was, during, this, period, that, the, bulk, of, japanese, war, crimes, were, committed, by, 1941, japan, had, occupied, much, of, north, and, coastal, china, but, the, kmt, central, government, and, military, had, retreated, to, the, western, interior, to, continue, their, resistance, while, the, chinese, communists, remained, in, control, of, base, areas, in, shaanxi, in, the, occupied, areas, japanese, control, was, mainly, limited, to, railroads, and, major, cities, points, and, lines, they, did, not, have, a, major, military, or, administrative, presence, in, the, vast, chinese, countryside, where, chinese, guerrillas, roamed, freely, the, united, states, strongly, supported, china, starting, in, 1937, and, warned, japan, to, get, out, however, the, united, states, continued, to, sell, japan, petroleum, and, scrap, metal, exports, until, the, japanese, invasion, of, french, indochina, when, the, u, s, imposed, a, scrap, metal, and, oil, embargo, against, japan, and, froze, all, japanese, assets, in, the, summer, of, 1941, as, the, soviets, prepared, for, war,

group, and, the, uniformed, u, s, army, air, forces, units, that, replaced, it, in, 1942, however, it, was, the, soviets, that, provided, the, greatest, material, help, for, china, s, war, of, resistance, against, the, imperial, japanese, invasion, from, 1937, into, 1941, with, fighter, aircraft, for, the, nationalist, chinese, air, force, and, artillery, and, armour, for, the, chinese, army, through, the, sino, soviet, treaty, operation, zet, also, provided, for, a, group, of, soviet, volunteer, combat, aviators, to, join, the, chinese, air, force, in, the, fight, against, the, japanese, occupation, from, late, 1937, through, 1939, the, united, states, embargoed, japan, in, 1941, depriving, her, of, shipments, of, oil, and, various, other, resources, necessary, to, continue, the, war, in, china, this, pressure, which, was, intended, to, disparage, a, continuation, of, the, war, and, bring, japan, into, negotiation, resulted, in, the, attack, on, pearl, harbor, and, japan, s, drive, south, to, procure, from, the, resource, rich, european, colonies, in, southeast, asia, by, force, the, resources, which, the, united, states, had, denied, to, them, after, the, mukden, incident, in, 1931, chinese, public, opinion, was, strongly, critical, of, manchuria, s, leader, the, young, marshal, zhang, xueliang, for, his, non, resistance, to, the, japanese, invasion, even, though, the, kuomintang, central, government, was, also, responsible, for, this, policy, giving, zhang, an, order, to, improvise, while, not, offering, support, after, losing, manchuria, to, the, japanese, zhang, and, his, northeast, army, were, given, the, duty, of, suppressing, the, red, army, of, the, chinese, communist, party, in, shaanxi, after, their, long, march, this, resulted, in, great, casualties, for, his, northeast, army, which, received, no, support, in, manpower, or, weaponry, from, chiang, kai, shek, on, 12, december, 1936, a, deeply, disgruntled, zhang, xueliang, kidnapped, chiang, kai, shek, in, xi, an, hoping, to, force, an, end, to, the, conflict, between, kmt, and, ccp, to, secure, the, release, of, chiang, the, kmt, agreed, to, a, temporary, ceasefire, of, the, chinese, civil, war, and, on, 24, december, the, formation, of, a, united, front, with, the, communists, against, japan, the, alliance, having, salutary, effects, for, the, beleaguered, ccp, agreed, to, form, the, new, fourth, army, and, the, 8th, route, army, and, place, them, under, the, nominal, control, of, the, nra, in, agreement, with, kmt, shaan, gan, ning, border, region, and,

dealing, selling, to, japanese, occupied, and, kmt, controlled, provinces, the, ccp, s, red, army, fought, alongside, kmt, forces, during, the, battle, of, taiyuan, and, the, high, point, of, their, cooperation, came, in, 1938, during, the, battle, of, wuhan, the, formation, of, a, united, front, added, to, the, legality, of, the, ccp, but, what, kind, of, support, the, central, government, would, provide, to, the, communists, were, not, settled, when, compromise, with, the, ccp, failed, to, incentivize, the, soviet, union, to, engage, in, an, open, conflict, against, japan, the, kmt, withheld, further, support, for, the, communists, to, strengthen, its, legitimacy, ccp, forces, actively, engaged, the, japanese, early, on, these, operations, weakened, japanese, forces, in, shanxi, and, other, areas, in, the, north, mao, zedong, was, distrustful, of, chiang, kai, shek, however, and, shifted, strategy, to, guerrilla, warfare, in, order, to, preserve, the, ccp, s, military, strength, despite, japan, s, steady, territorial, gains, in, northern, china, the, coastal, regions, and, the, rich, yangtze, river, valley, in, central, china, the, distrust, between, the, two, antagonists, was, scarcely, veiled, the, uneasy, alliance, began, to, break, down, by, late, 1938, partially, due, to, the, communists, aggressive, efforts, to, expand, their, military, strength, by, absorbing, chinese, guerrilla, forces, behind, japanese, lines, chinese, militia, who, refused, to, switch, their, allegiance, were, often, labelled, collaborators, and, attacked, by, ccp, forces, for, example, the, red, army, led, by, he, long, attacked, and, wiped, out, a, brigade, of, chinese, militia, led, by, zhang, yin, wu, in, hebei, in, june, 1939, starting, in, 1940, open, conflict, between, nationalists, and, communists, became, more, frequent, in, the, occupied, areas, outside, of, japanese, control, culminating, in, the, new, fourth, army, incident, in, january, 1941, afterwards, the, second, united, front, completely, broke, down, and, chinese, communists, leader, mao, zedong, outlined, the, preliminary, plan, for, the, ccp, s, eventual, seizure, of, power, from, chiang, kai, shek, mao, himself, is, quoted, outlining, the, 721, policy, saying, we, are, fighting, 70, percent, for, self, development, 20, percent, for, compromise, and, 10, percent, against, japan, mao, began, his, final, push, for, consolidation, of, ccp, power, under, his, authority, and, his, teachings, became, the, central, tenets, of, the, ccp, doctrine, that, came, to, be, formalized, as, mao, zedong, thought, the, communists, also, began, to, focus, most, of, their, energy, on, building, up, their, sphere, of, influence, wherever, opportunities, were, presented, mainly, through, rural, mass, organizations, administrative, land, and, tax, reform, measures, favouring, poor, peasants, while, the, nationalists, attempted, to, neutralize, the, spread, of, communist, influence, by, military, blockade, of, areas, controlled, by, ccp, and, fighting, the, japanese, at, the, same, time, following, the, attack, on, pearl, harbor, the, united, states, declared, war, against, japan, and, within, days, china, joined, the, allies, in, formal, declaration, of, war, against, japan, germany, and, italy, as, the, western, allies, entered, the, war, against, japan, the, sino, japanese, war, would, become, part, of, a, greater, conflict, the, pacific, theatre, of, world, war, ii, almost, immediately, chinese, troops, achieved, another, decisive,

united, kingdom, soviet, union, and, china, as, the, world, s, four, policemen, his, primary, reason, for, elevating, china, to, such, a, status, was, the, belief, that, after, the, war, it, would, serve, as, a, bulwark, against, the, soviet, union, knowledge, of, japanese, naval, movements, in, the, pacific, was, provided, to, the, american, navy, by, the, sino, american, cooperative,

union, which, stayed, open, through, most, of, the, war, sea, routes, to, china, and, the, yunnan, vietnam, railway, had, been, closed, since, 1940, therefore, between, the, closing, of, the, burma, road, in, 1942, and, its, re, opening, as, the, ledo, road, in, 1945, foreign, aid, was, largely, limited, to, what, could, be, flown, in, over, the, hump, in, burma, on, 16, april, 1942, 7, 000,

government, never, had, the, supplies, and, equipment, needed, to, mount, major, counter, offensives, despite, the, severe, shortage, of, mat, riel, in, 1943, the, chinese, were, successful, in, repelling, major, japanese, offensives, in, hubei, and, changde, chiang, was, named, allied, commander, in, chief, in, the, china, theater, in, 1942, american, general, joseph, stilwell, served, for, a, time, as, chiang, s, chief, of, staff, while, simultaneously, commanding, american, forces, in, the, china, burma, india, theater, for, many, reasons, relations, between, stilwell, and, chiang, soon, broke, down, many, historians, such, as, barbara, w, tuchman, have, suggested, it, was, largely, due, to, the, corruption, and, inefficiency, of, the, kuomintang, government, while, others, such, as, ray, huang, and, hans, van, de, ven, have, depicted, it, as, a, more, complicated, situation, stilwell, had, a, strong, desire, to, assume, total, control, of, chinese, troops, and, pursue, an, aggressive, strategy, while, chiang, preferred, a, patient, and, less, expensive, strategy, of, out, waiting, the, japanese, chiang, continued, to, maintain, a, defensive, posture, despite, allied, pleas, to, actively, break, the, japanese, blockade, because, china, had, already, suffered, tens, of, millions, of, war, casualties, and, believed, that, japan, would, eventually, capitulate, in, the, face, of, america, s, overwhelming, industrial, output, for, these, reasons, the, other, allies, gradually, began, to, lose, confidence, in, the, chinese, ability, to, conduct, offensive, operations, from, the, asian, mainland, and, instead, concentrated, their, efforts, against, the, japanese, in, the, pacific, ocean, areas, and, south, west, pacific, area, employing, an, island,

stilwell, on, the, other, hand, believed, that, reopening, the, road, was, vital, as, all, china, s, mainland, ports, were, under, japanese, control, the, allies, europe, first, policy, did, not, sit, well, with, chiang, while, the, later, british, insistence, that, china, send, more, and, more, troops, to, indochina, for, use, in, the, burma, campaign, was, seen, by, chiang, as, an, attempt, to, use, chinese, manpower, to, defend, british, colonial, possessions, chiang, also, believed, that, china, should, divert, its, crack, army, divisions, from, burma, to, eastern, china, to, defend, the, airbases, of, the, american, bombers, that, he, hoped, would, defeat, japan, through, bombing, a, strategy, that, american, general, claire, lee, chennault, supported, but, which, stilwell, strongly, opposed, in, addition, chiang, voiced, his, support, of, indian, independence, in, a, 1942, meeting, with, mahatma, gandhi, which, further, soured, the, relationship, between, china, and, the, united,

their, operation, in, mission, 204, which, attempted, to, provide, assistance, to, the, chinese, nationalist, army, the, first, phase, in, 1942, under, command, of, soe, achieved, very, little, but, lessons, were, learned, and, a, second, more, successful, phase, commenced, in, february, 1943, under, british, military, command, was, conducted, before, the, japanese, operation, ichi, go,

broader, war, 21, american, bombers, in, chengdu, were, moved, to, the, mariana, islands, where, along, with, bombers, from, bases, in, saipan, and, tinian, they, could, still, bomb, the, japanese, home, islands, 22, after, operation, ichigo, chiang, kai, shek, started, a, plan, to, withdraw, chinese, troops, from, the, burma, theatre, against, japan, in, southeast, asia, for, a, counter, offensive, called, white, tower, and, iceman, against, japanese, soldiers, in, china, in, 1945, the, poor, performance, of, chiang, kai, shek, s, forces, in, opposing, the, japanese, advance, during, operation, ichigo, became, widely, viewed, as, demonstrating, chiang, s, incompetence, 3, it, irreparably, damaged, the, roosevelt, administration, s, view, of, chiang, and, the, kmt, 75, the,

especially, through, indo, china, which, became, of, absolute, tantamount, importance, when, the, japanese, cut, off, all, ocean, access, to, china, s, interior, with, the, capture, of, nanning, after, the, battle, of, south, guangxi, overseas, chinese, communities, in, the, u, s, raised, money, and, nurtured, talent, in, response, to, imperial, japan, s, aggressions, in, china, which, helped, to, fund, an, entire, squadron, of, boeing, p, 26, fighter, planes, purchased, for, the, looming, war, situation, between, china, and, the, empire, of, japan, over, a, dozen, chinese, american, aviators, including, john, buffalo, huang, arthur, chin, hazel, ying, lee, chan, kee, wong, et, al, formed, the, original, contingent, of, foreign, volunteer, aviators, to, join, the,

china, in, the, patriotic, call, to, duty, for, the, motherland, to, fight, against, the, imperial, japanese, invasion, several, of, the, original, chinese, american, volunteer, pilots, were, sent, to, lagerlechfeld, air, base, in, germany, for, aerial, gunnery, training, by, the, chinese, air, force, in, 1936, prior, to, the, war, germany, and, china, were, in, close, economic, and, military, cooperation, with, germany, helping, china, modernize, its, industry, and, military, in, exchange, for, raw, materials, germany, sent, military, advisers, such, as, alexander, von, falkenhausen, to, china, to, help, the, kmt, government, reform, its, armed, forces, some, divisions, began, training, to, german, standards, and, were, to, form, a, relatively, small, but, well, trained, chinese, central, army, by, the, mid, 1930s, about, 80, 000, soldiers, had, received, german, style, training, after, the, kmt, lost, nanjing, and, retreated, to, wuhan, hitler, s, government, decided, to, withdraw, its, support, of, china, in, 1938, in, favour, of, an, alliance, with, japan, as, its, main, anti, communist, partner, in, east, asia, after, germany, and, japan, signed, the, anti, communist, anti, comintern, pact, the, soviet, union, hoped, to, keep, china, fighting, in, order, to, deter, a, japanese, invasion, of, siberia, and, save, itself, from, a, two, front, war, in, september, 1937, they, signed, the, sino, soviet, non, aggression, pact, and, approved, operation, zet, the, formation, of, a, secret, soviet, volunteer, air, force, in, which, soviet, technicians, upgraded, and, ran, some, of, china, s, transportation, systems, bombers, fighters, supplies, and, advisors, arrived, headed, by, aleksandr, cherepanov, prior, to, the, western, allies, the, soviets, provided, the, most, foreign, aid, to, china, some, 250, million, in, credits, for, munitions, and, other, supplies, the, soviet, union, defeated, japan, in, the, battles, of, khalkhin, gol, in, may, september, 1939, leaving, the, japanese, reluctant, to, fight, the, soviets, again, in, april, 1941, soviet, aid, to, china, ended, with, the, soviet, japanese, neutrality, pact, and, the, beginning, of, the, great, patriotic, war, this, pact, enabled, the, soviet, union, to, avoid, fighting, against, germany, and, japan, at, the, same, time, in, august, 1945, the, soviet, union, annulled, the, neutrality, pact, with, japan, and, invaded, manchuria, inner, mongolia, the, kuril, islands, and, northern, korea, the, soviets, also, continued, to, support, the, chinese, communist, party, in, total, 3, 665, soviet, advisors, and, pilots, served, in, china, and, 227, of, them, died, fighting, there, the, united, states, generally, avoided, taking, sides, between, japan, and, china, until, 1940, providing, virtually, no, aid, to, china, in, this, period, for, instance, the, 1934, silver, purchase, act, signed, by, president, roosevelt, caused, chaos, in, china, s, economy, which, helped, the, japanese, war, effort, the, 1933, wheat, and, cotton, loan, mainly, benefited, american, producers, while, aiding, to, a, smaller, extent, both, chinese, and, japanese, alike, this, policy, was, due, to, us, fear, of, breaking, off, profitable, trade, ties, with, japan, in, addition, to, us, officials, and, businesses, perception, of, china, as, a, potential, source, of, massive, profit, for, the, us, by, absorbing, surplus, american, products, as, william, appleman, williams, states, from, december, 1937, events, such, as, the, japanese, attack, on, uss, panay, and, the, nanjing, massacre, swung, public, opinion, in, the, west, sharply, against, japan, and, increased, their, fear, of, japanese, expansion, which, prompted, the, united, states, the, united, kingdom, and, france, to, provide, loan, assistance, for, war, supply, contracts, to, china, australia, also, prevented, a, japanese, government, owned, company, from, taking, over, an, iron, mine, in, australia, and, banned, iron, ore, exports, in, 1938, however, in, july, 1939, negotiations, between, japanese, foreign, minister, arita, khatira, and, the, british, ambassador, in, tokyo, robert, craigie, led, to, an, agreement, by, which, the, united, kingdom, recognized, japanese, conquests, in, china, at, the, same, time, the, us, government, extended, a, trade, agreement, with, japan, for, six, months, then, fully, restored, it, under, the, agreement, japan, purchased, trucks, for, the, kwantung, army, machine, tools, for, aircraft, factories, strategic, materials, steel, and, scrap, iron, up, to, 16, october, 1940, petrol, and, petroleum, products, up, to, 26, june, 1941, and, various, other, much, needed, supplies, in, a, hearing, before, the, united, states, congress, house, of, representatives, committee, on, foreign, affairs, on, wednesday, 19, april, 1939, the, acting, chairman, sol, bloom, and, other, congressmen, interviewed, maxwell, s, stewart, a, former, foreign, policy, association, research, staff, and, economist, who, charged, that, america, s, neutrality, act, and, its, neutrality, policy, was, a, massive, farce, which, only, benefited, japan, and, that, japan, did, not, have, the, capability, nor, could, ever, have, invaded, china, without, the, massive, amount, of, raw, material, america, exported, to, japan, america, exported, far, more, raw, material, to, japan, than, to, china, in, the, years, 1937, 1940, according, to, the, united, states, congress, the, u, s, s, third, largest, export, destination, was, japan, until, 1940, when, france, overtook, it, due, to, france, being, at, war, too, japan, s, military, machine, acquired, war, materials, automotive, equipment, steel, scrap, iron, copper, oil, that, it, wanted, from, the, united, states, in, 1937, 1940, and, was, allowed, to, purchase, aerial, bombs, aircraft, equipment, and, aircraft, from, america, up, to, the, summer, of, 1938, war, essentials, exports, from, the, united, states, to, japan, increased, by, 124, along, with, a, general, increase, of, 41, of, all, american, exports, from, 1936, to, 1937, when, japan, invaded, china, japan, s, war, economy, was, fueled, by, exports, to, the, united, states, at, over, twice, the, rate, immediately, preceding, the, war, according, to, the, u, s, department, of, commerce, japan, corresponded, to, the, following, share, of, american, exports, japan, invaded, and, occupied, the, northern, part, of, french, indochina, in, september, 1940, to, prevent, china, from, receiving, the, 10, 000, tons, of, materials,

the, west, to, china, the, move, into, southern, french, indochina, was, viewed, as, a, direct, threat, to, british, and, dutch, colonies, many, principal, figures, in, the, japanese, government, and, military, particularly, the, navy, were, against, the, move, as, they, foresaw, that, it, would, invite, retaliation, from, the, west, on, 24, july, 1941, roosevelt, requested, japan, withdraw, all, its, forces, from, indochina, two, days, later, the, us, and, the, uk, began, an, oil, embargo, two, days, after, that, the, netherlands, joined, them, this, was, a, decisive, moment, in, the, second, sino, japanese, war, the, loss, of, oil, imports, made, it, impossible, for, japan, to, continue, operations, in, china, on, a, long, term, basis, it, set, the, stage, for, japan, to, launch, a, series, of, military, attacks, against, the, allies, including, the, attack, on, pearl, harbor, on, 7, december, 1941, in, mid, 1941, the, united, states, government, financed, the, creation, of, the,

war, nominally, a, great, military, power, but, economically, weak, and, on, the, verge, of, all, out, civil, war, the, economy, was, sapped, by, the, military, demands, of, a, long, costly, war, and, internal, strife, by, spiraling, inflation, and, by, corruption, in, the, nationalist, government, that, included, profiteering, speculation, and, hoarding, the, poor, performance, of, nationalist, forces, opposing, the, ichi, go, campaign, was, largely, viewed, as, reflecting, poorly, on, chiang, s, competence, 3, chiang, blamed, the, failure, on, the, united, states, particularly, stilwell, who, had, used, chinese, forces, in, the, burma, campaign, and, in, chiang, s, view, left, china, insufficiently, defended, 3, as, part, of, the, yalta, conference, which, allowed, a, soviet, sphere, of, influence, in, manchuria, the, soviets, dismantled, and, removed, more, than, half, of, the, industrial, equipment, left, there, by, the, japanese, before, handing, over, manchuria, to, china, large, swathes, of, the, prime, farming, areas, had, been, ravaged, by, the, fighting, and, there, was, starvation, and, famine, in, the, wake, of, the, war, many, towns, and, cities, were, destroyed, and, millions, were, rendered, homeless, by, floods, the, problems, of, rehabilitation, and, reconstruction, after, the, ravages, of, a, protracted, war, were, staggering, and, the, war, left, the, nationalists, severely, weakened, and, their, policies, left, them, unpopular, meanwhile, the, war, strengthened, the, communists, both, in, popularity, and, as, a, viable, fighting, force, at, yan, an, and, elsewhere, in, the, communist, controlled, areas, mao, zedong, was, able, to, adapt, marxism, leninism, to, chinese, conditions, he, taught, party, cadres, to, lead, the, masses, by, living, and, working, with, them, eating, their, food, and, thinking, their, thoughts, the, chinese, red, army, fostered, an, image, of, conducting, guerrilla, warfare, in, defense, of, the, people, communist, troops, adapted, to, changing, wartime, conditions, and, became, a, seasoned, fighting, force, with, skillful, organization, and, propaganda, the, communists, increased, party, membership, from, 100, 000, in, 1937, to, 1, 2, million, by, 1945, mao, also, began, to, execute, his, plan, to, establish, a, new, china, by, rapidly, moving, his, forces, from, yan, an, and, elsewhere, to, manchuria, this, opportunity, was, available, to, the, communists, because, although, nationalist, representatives, were, not, invited, to, yalta, they, had, been, consulted, and, had, agreed, to, the, soviet, invasion, of, manchuria, in, the, belief, that, the, soviet, union, would, cooperate, only, with, the, nationalist, government, after, the, war, however, the, soviet, occupation, of, manchuria, was, long, enough, to, allow, the, communist, forces, to, move, in, en, masse, and, arm, themselves, with, the, military, hardware, surrendered, by, the, imperial, japanese, army, quickly, establish, control, in, the, countryside, and, move, into, position, to, encircle, the, nationalist, government, army, in, major, cities, of, northeast, china, following, that, the, chinese, civil, war, broke, out, between, the, nationalists, and, communists, which, concluded, with, the, communist, victory, in, mainland, china, and, the, retreat, of, the, nationalists, to, taiwan, in, 1949, the, nationalists, suffered, higher, casualties, because, they, were, the, main, combatants, opposing, the, japanese, in, each, of, the, 22, major, battles, involving, more, than, 100, 000, troops, on, both, sides, between, china, and, japan, the, communist, forces, by, contrast, usually, avoided, pitched, battles, with, the, japanese, in, which, their, guerrilla, tactics, were, less, effective, and, generally, limited, their, combat, to, guerrilla, actions, the, hundred, regiments, offensive, and, the, battle, of, pingxingguan, are, notable, exceptions, the, nationalists, committed, their, strongest, divisions, in, early, battle, against, the, japanese, including, the, 36th, 87th, 88th, divisions, the, crack, divisions, of, chiang, s, central, army, to, defend, shanghai, and, continued, to, deploy, most, of, their, forces, to, fight, the, japanese, even, as, the, communists, changed, their, strategy, to, engage, mainly, in, a, political, offensive, against, the, japanese, while, declaring, that, the, ccp, should, save, and, preserve, our, strength, and, wait, for, favourable, timing, by, the, end, of, 1941, today, the, war, is, a, major, point, of, contention, and, resentment, between, china, and, japan, the, war, remains, a, major, roadblock, for, sino, japanese, relations, issues, regarding, the, current, historical, outlook, on, the, war, exist, for, example, the, japanese, government, has, been, accused, of, historical, revisionism, by, allowing, the, approval, of, a, few, school, textbooks, omitting, or, glossing, over, japan, s, militant, past, although, the, most, recent, controversial, book, the, new, history, textbook, was, used, by, only, 0, 039, of, junior, high, schools, in, japan, and, despite, the, efforts, of, the, japanese, nationalist, textbook, reformers, by, the, late, 1990s, the, most, common, japanese, schoolbooks, contained, references, to, for, instance, the, nanjing, massacre, unit, 731, and, the, comfort, women, of, world, war, ii, all, historical, issues, which, have, faced, challenges, from, ultranationalists, in, the, past, in, 2005, a, history, textbook, prepared, by, the, japanese, society, for, history, textbook, reform, which, had, been, approved, by, the, government, in, 2001, sparked, huge, outcry, and, protests, in, china, and, korea, it, referred, to, the, nanjing, massacre, and, other, atrocities, such, as, the, manila, massacre, as, an, incident, glossed, over, the, issue, of, comfort, women, and, made, only, brief, references, to, the, death, of, chinese, soldiers, and, civilians, in, nanjing, a, copy, of, the, 2005, version, of, a, junior, high, school, textbook, titled, new, history, textbook, found, that, there, is, no, mention, of, the, nanjing, massacre, or, the, nanjing, incident, indeed, the, only, one, sentence, that, referred, to, this, event, was, they, occupied, that, city, in, december, taiwan, and, the, penghu, islands, were, put, under, the, administrative, control, of, the, republic, of, china, roc, government, in, 1945, by, the, united, nations, relief, and, rehabilitation, administration, the, roc, proclaimed, taiwan, retrocession, day, on, 25, october, 1945, however, due, to, the, unresolved, chinese, civil, war, neither, the, newly, established, people, s, republic, of, china, in, mainland, china, nor, the, nationalist, roc, that, retreated, to, taiwan, was, invited, to, sign, the, treaty, of, san, francisco, as, neither, had, shown, full, and, complete, legal, capacity, to, enter, into, an, international, legally, binding, agreement, since, china, was, not, present, the, japanese, only, formally, renounced, the, territorial, sovereignty, of, taiwan, and, penghu, islands, without, specifying, to, which, country, japan, relinquished, the, sovereignty, and, the, treaty, was, signed, in, 1951, and, came, into, force, in, 1952, in, 1952, the, treaty, of, taipei, was, signed, separately, between, the, roc, and, japan, that, basically, followed, the, same, guideline, of, the, treaty, of, san, francisco, not, specifying, which, country, has, sovereignty, over, taiwan, however, article, 10, of, the, treaty, states, that, the, taiwanese, people, and, the, juridical, person, should, be, the, people, and, the, juridical, person, of, the, roc, both, the, prc, and, roc, governments, base, their, claims, to, taiwan, on, the, japanese, instrument, of, surrender, which, specifically, accepted, the, potsdam, declaration, which, refers, to, the, cairo, declaration, disputes, over, the, precise, de, jure, sovereign, of, taiwan, persist, to, the, present, on, a, de, facto, basis, sovereignty, over, taiwan, has, been, and, continues, to, be, exercised, by, the, roc, japan, s, position, has, been, to, avoid, commenting, on, taiwan, s, status, maintaining, that, japan, renounced, all, claims, to, sovereignty, over, its, former, colonial, possessions, after, world, war, ii, including, taiwan, traditionally, the, republic, of, china, government, has, held, celebrations, marking, the, victory, day, on, 9, september, now, known, as, armed, forces, day, and, taiwan, s, retrocession, day, on, 25, october, however, after, the, democratic, progressive, party, dpp, won, the, presidential, election, in, 2000, these, national, holidays, commemorating, the, war, have, been, cancelled, as, the, pro, independent, dpp, does, not, see, the, relevancy, of, celebrating, events, that, happened, in, mainland, china, meanwhile, many, kmt, supporters, particularly, veterans, who, retreated, with, the, government, in, 1949, still, have, an, emotional, interest, in, the, war, for, example, in, celebrating, the, 60th, anniversary, of, the, end, of, war, in, 2005, the, cultural, bureau, of, kmt, stronghold, taipei, held, a, series, of, talks, in, the, sun, yat, sen, memorial, hall, regarding, the, war, and, post, war, developments, while, the, kmt, held, its, own, exhibit, in, the, kmt, headquarters, whereas, the, kmt, won, the, presidential, election, in, 2008, the, roc, government, resumed, commemorating, the, war, several, thousand, japanese, who, were, sent, as, colonizers, to, manchukuo, and, inner, mongolia, were, left, behind, in, china, the, majority, of, these, were, women, and, they, married, mostly, chinese, men, and, became, known, as, stranded, war, wives, zanryu, fujin, in, china, some, korean, comfort, women, stayed, behind, instead, of, going, back, to, their, native, land, most, korean, comfort, women, who, were, left, behind, in, china, married, chinese,
