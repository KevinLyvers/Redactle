chronological, history, vikings, were, seafaring, people, originally, from, scandinavia, present, day, denmark, norway, and, sweden, who, from, the, late, 8th, to, the, late, 11th, centuries, raided, pirated, traded, and, settled, throughout, parts, of, europe, they, also, voyaged, as, far, as, the, mediterranean, north, africa, the, middle, east, greenland, and, vinland, present, day, newfoundland, in, canada, north, america, in, their, countries, of, origin, and, some, of, the, countries, they, raided, and, settled, in, this, period, is, popularly, known, as, the, viking, age, and, the, term, viking, also, commonly, includes, the, inhabitants, of, the, scandinavian, homelands, as, a, whole, the, vikings, had, a, profound, impact, on, the, early, medieval, history, of, scandinavia, the, british, isles, france, estonia, and, kievan, rus, expert, sailors, and, navigators, of, their, characteristic, longships, vikings, established, norse, settlements, and, governments, in, the, british, isles, the, faroe, islands, iceland, greenland, normandy, and, the, baltic, coast, as, well, as, along, the, dnieper, and, volga, trade, routes, across, modern, day, russia, belarus, and, ukraine, where, they, were, also, known, as, varangians, the, normans, norse, gaels, rus, people, faroese, and, icelanders, emerged, from, these, norse, colonies, at, one, point, a, group, of, rus, vikings, went, so, far, south, that, after, briefly, being, bodyguards, for, the, byzantine, emperor, they, attacked, the, byzantine, city, of, constantinople, vikings, also, voyaged, to, iran, and, arabia, they, were, the, first, europeans, to, reach, north, america, briefly, settling, in, newfoundland, vinland, while, spreading, norse, culture, to, foreign, lands, they, simultaneously, brought, home, slaves, concubines, and, foreign, cultural, influences, to, scandinavia, influencing, the, genetic, and, historical, development, of, both, during, the, viking, age, the, norse, homelands, were, gradually, consolidated, from, smaller, kingdoms, into, three, larger, kingdoms, denmark, norway, and, sweden, the, vikings, spoke, old, norse, and, made, inscriptions, in, runes, for, most, of, the, period, they, followed, the, old, norse, religion, but, later, became, christians, the, vikings, had, their, own, laws, art, and, architecture, most, vikings, were, also, farmers, fishermen, craftsmen, and, traders, popular, conceptions, of, the, vikings, often, strongly, differ, from, the, complex, advanced, civilisation, of, the, norsemen, that, emerges, from, archaeology, and, historical, sources, a, romanticised, picture, of, vikings, as, noble, savages, began, to, emerge, in, the, 18th, century, this, developed, and, became, widely, propagated, during, the, 19th, century, viking, revival, perceived, views, of, the, vikings, as, violent, piratical, heathens, or, as, intrepid, adventurers, owe, much, to, conflicting, varieties, of, the, modern, viking, myth, that, had, taken, shape, by, the, early, 20th, century, current, popular, representations, of, the, vikings, are, typically, based, on, cultural, clich, s, and, stereotypes, complicating, modern, appreciation, of, the, viking, legacy, these, representations, are, rarely, accurate, for, example, there, is, no, evidence, that, they, wore, horned, helmets, a, costume, element, that, first, appeared, in, the, 19th, century, the, essential, three, elements, of, the, word, viking, are, the, original, meaning, and, derivation, or, etymology, its, medieval, usage, and, its, current, modern, day, usage, according, to, some, authors, these, three, elements, are, often, confused, in, popular, and, scholarly, discussions, also, the, etymology, of, the, word, has, been, much, debated, by, academics, with, many, origin, theories, being, proposed, one, theory, suggests, that, the, word, s, origin, is, from, the, old, english, wicing, and, the, old, frisian, wizing, that, are, almost, 300, years, older, and, probably, derive, from, wic, related, to, the, latin, vicus, village, habitation, another, less, popular, theory, is, that, v, king, came, from, the, feminine, v, k, meaning, creek, inlet, small, bay, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, word, viking, may, be, derived, from, the, name, of, the, historical, norwegian, district, of, v, kin, meaning, a, person, from, v, kin, but, people, from, the, viken, area, were, called, v, kverir, v, k, dwellers, not, viking, in, old, norse, manuscripts, the, explanation, could, explain, only, the, masculine, grammatical, gender, v, kingr, and, not, the, feminine, v, king, the, masculine, is, more, easily, derived, from, the, feminine, than, the, other, way, around, another, etymology, that, gained, support, in, the, early, 21st, century, derives, viking, from, the, same, root, as, old, norse, vika, f, sea, mile, originally, meaning, the, distance, between, two, shifts, of, rowers, from, the, root, weik, or, w, k, as, in, the, proto, germanic, verb, w, kan, to, recede, this, is, found, in, the, early, nordic, verb, wikan, to, turn, similar, to, old, icelandic, v, kja, kva, v, kva, to, move, to, turn, with, well, attested, nautical, usages, according, to, bernard, mees, this, theory, is, better, attested, linguistically, and, the, term, most, likely, predates, the, use, of, the, sail, by, the, germanic, peoples, of, northwestern, europe, because, the, old, frisian, spelling, witsing, or, w, sing, shows, that, the, word, was, pronounced, with, a, palatal, k, and, thus, in, all, probability, existed, in, north, western, germanic, before, that, palatalisation, happened, in, the, 5th, century, or, before, in, the, western, branch, the, old, norse, feminine, v, king, as, in, the, phrase, fara, v, king, may, originally, have, been, a, long, distance, sea, journey, characterised, by, the, shifting, of, rowers, and, a, v, kingr, masculine, gender, would, originally, have, been, a, participant, on, such, a, sea, journey, in, that, case, the, idea, behind, it, seems, to, be, that, the, tired, rower, moves, aside, on, the, thwart, when, he, is, relieved, by, the, rested, rower, this, implies, that, the, word, viking, was, not, originally, connected, to, scandinavian, seafarers, but, assumed, this, meaning, when, the, scandinavians, began, to, dominate, the, seas, even, the, word, vikingr, did, not, necessarily, possess, negative, overtones, nor, was, it, always, associated, with, violence, and, only, in, the, post, viking, age, would, negative, overtones, be, attached, to, the, word, in, the, middle, ages, viking, came, to, mean, scandinavian, pirate, or, raider, the, earliest, reference, to, wicing, in, english, sources, is, from, the, pinal, erfurt, glossary, which, dates, to, around, 700, the, glossary, s, latin, translation, for, wicing, is, piraticum, or, pirate, in, modern, english, whereas, the, first, known, attack, by, viking, raiders, in, england, was, at, lindisfarne, about, 93, years, later, in, old, english, the, word, wicing, appears, in, the, anglo, saxon, poem, widsith, probably, from, the, 9th, century, the, word, was, not, regarded, as, a, reference, to, nationality, with, other, terms, such, as, nor, menn, northmen, and, dene, danes, being, used, for, that, in, asser, s, latin, work, the, life, of, king, alfred, the, danes, are, referred, to, as, pagani, pagans, historian, janet, nelson, asserts, that, pagani, has, become, the, vikings, throughout, the, standard, translation, of, this, work, even, though, there, is, clear, evidence, that, it, was, used, as, a, synonym, for, danes, while, eric, christiansen, avers, that, it, is, a, mistranslation, made, at, the, insistence, of, the, publisher, the, word, wicing, does, not, occur, in, any, preserved, middle, english, texts, the, form, occurs, as, a, personal, name, on, some, swedish, runestones, the, stone, of, t, ki, v, king, sm, 10, was, raised, in, memory, of, a, local, man, named,

before, the, end, of, the, viking, age, in, eastern, europe, of, which, parts, were, ruled, by, a, norse, elite, v, kingr, came, to, be, perceived, as, a, positive, concept, meaning, hero, in, the, russian, borrowed, form, vityaz, in, the, history, of, the, archbishops, of, hamburg, bremen, gesta, hammaburgensis, ecclesiae, pontifi, written, by, adam, of, bremen, and, completed, in, the, 1080s, the, term, generally, referred, to, scandinavian, pirates, or, raiders, the, word, viking, was, introduced, into, modern, english, during, the, 18th, century, viking, revival, at, which, point, it, acquired, romanticised, heroic, overtones, of, barbarian, warrior, or, noble, savage, during, the, 20th, century, the, meaning, of, the, term, was, expanded, to, refer, not, only, to, seaborne, raiders, from, scandinavia, and, other, places, settled, by, them, like, iceland, and, the, faroe, islands, but, also, any, member, of, the, culture, that, produced, the, raiders, during, the, period, from, the, late, 8th, to, the, mid, 11th, centuries, or, more, loosely, from, about, 700, to, as, late, as, about, 1100, as, an, adjective, the, word, is, used, to, refer, to, ideas, phenomena, or,

coastal, eastern, sweden, around, the, eighth, century, and, that, their, name, has, the, same, origin, as, roslagen, in, sweden, with, the, older, name, being, roden, according, to, the, prevalent, theory, the, name, rus, like, the, proto, finnic, name, for, sweden, ruotsi, is, derived, from, an, old, norse, term, for, the, men, who, row, rods, as, rowing, was, the, main, method, of, navigating, the, rivers, of, eastern, europe, and, that, it, could, be, linked, to, the, swedish, coastal, area, of, roslagen, rus, law, or, roden, as, it, was, known, in, earlier, times, the, name, rus, would,

bonn, posits, that, the, presence, of, slavs, in, scandinavia, is, more, significant, than, previously, thought, while, mats, roslund, states, that, the, slavs, and, their, interaction, with, scandinavia, have, not, been, adequately, investigated, a, 10th, century, grave, of, a, warrior, woman, in, denmark, was, long, thought, to, belong, to, a, viking, however, new, analyses, suggest, that, the, woman, may, have, been, a, slav, from, present, day, poland, the, first, king, of, the, swedes, eric, was, married, to, gunhild, of, the, polish, house, of, piast, likewise, his, son, olof,

iceland, by, norwegian, vikings, began, in, the, 9th, century, the, first, source, mentioning, iceland, and, greenland, is, a, papal, letter, from, 1053, twenty, years, later, they, appear, in, the, gesta, of, adam, of, bremen, it, was, not, until, after, 1130, when, the, islands, had, become, christianised, that, accounts, of, the, history, of, the, islands, were, written, from, the, point, of, view, of, the, inhabitants, in, sagas, and, chronicles, the, vikings, explored, the, northern, islands, and, coasts, of, the, north, atlantic, ventured, south, to, north, africa, east, to, kievan, rus, now, ukraine, belarus, constantinople, and, the, middle, east, they, raided, and, pillaged, traded, acted, as, mercenaries, and, settled, colonies, over, a, wide, area, early, vikings, probably, returned, home, after, their, raids, later, in, their, history, they, began, to, settle, in, other, lands, vikings, under, leif, erikson, heir, to, erik, the, red, reached, north, america, and, set, up, short, lived, settlements, in, present, day, l, anse, aux, meadows, newfoundland, canada, this, expansion, occurred, during, the, medieval, warm, period, viking, expansion, into, continental, europe, was, limited, their, realm, was, bordered, by, powerful, tribes, to, the, south, early, on, it, was, the, saxons, who, occupied, old, saxony, located, in, what, is, now, northern, germany, the, saxons, were, a, fierce, and, powerful, people, and, were, often, in, conflict, with, the, vikings, to, counter, the, saxon, aggression, and, solidify, their, own, presence, the, danes, constructed, the, huge, defence, fortification, of, danevirke, in, and, around, hedeby, the, vikings, witnessed, the, violent, subduing, of, the, saxons, by, charlemagne, in, the, thirty, year, saxon, wars, of, 772, 804, the, saxon, defeat, resulted, in, their, forced, christening, and, the, absorption, of, old, saxony, into, the, carolingian, empire, fear, of, the, franks, led, the, vikings, to, further, expand, danevirke, and, the, defence, constructions, remained, in, use, throughout, the, viking, age, and, even, up, until, 1864, the, southern, coast, of, the, baltic, sea, was, ruled, by, the, obotrites, a, federation, of, slavic, tribes, loyal, to, the, carolingians, and, later, the, frankish, empire, the, vikings, led, by, king, gudfred, destroyed, the, obotrite, city, of, reric, on, the, southern, baltic, coast, in, 808, ad, and, transferred, the, merchants, and, traders, to, hedeby, this, secured, viking, supremacy, in, the, baltic, sea, which, continued, throughout, the, viking, age, because, of, the, expansion, of, the, vikings, across, europe, a, comparison, of, dna, and, archeology, undertaken, by, scientists, at, the, university, of, cambridge, and, university, of, copenhagen, suggested, that, the, term, viking, may, have, evolved, to, become, a, job, description, not, a, matter, of, heredity, at, least, in, some, viking, bands, the, motives, driving, the, viking, expansion, are, a, topic, of, much, debate, the, concept, that, vikings, may, have, originally, started, sailing, and, raiding, due, to, a, need, to, seek, out, women, from, foreign, lands, was, expressed, in, the, 11th, century, by, historian, dudo, of, saint, quentin, in, his, semi, imaginary, history, of, the, normans, as, observed, by, adam, of, bremen, rich, and, powerful, viking, men, tended, to, have, many, wives, and, concubines, and, these, polygynous, relationships, may, have, led, to, a, shortage, of, women, available, to, the, viking, male, consequently, the, average, viking, man, may, have, felt, compelled, to, seek, wealth, and, power, to, have, the, means, to, acquire, suitable, women, several, centuries, after, dudo, s, observations, scholars, revived, this, idea, and, over, time, it, became, a, clich, among, scholars, of, the, viking, age, viking, men, would, often, buy, or, capture, women, and, make, them, into, their, wives, or, concubines, such, polygynous, marriages, increase, male, male, competition, in, society, because, they, create, a, pool, of, unmarried, men, who, are, willing, to, engage, in, risky, status, elevating, and, sex, seeking, behaviors, the, annals, of, ulster, states, that, in, 821, the, vikings, plundered, an, irish, village, and, carried, off, a, great, number, of, women, into, captivity, one, common, theory, posits, that, charlemagne, used, force, and, terror, to, christianise, all, pagans, leading, to, baptism, conversion, or, execution, and, as, a, result, vikings, and, other, pagans, resisted, and, wanted, revenge, professor, rudolf, simek, states, that, it, is, not, a, coincidence, if, the, early, viking, activity, occurred, during, the, reign, of, charlemagne, the, ascendance, of, christianity, in, scandinavia, led, to, serious, conflict, dividing, norway, for, almost, a, century, however, this, time, period, did, not, commence, until, the, 10th, century, norway, was, never, subject, to, aggression, by, charlemagne, and, the, period, of, strife, was, due, to, successive, norwegian, kings, embracing, christianity, after, encountering, it, overseas, another, explanation, is, that, the, vikings, exploited, a, moment, of, weakness, in, the, surrounding, regions, contrary, to, simek, s, assertion, viking, raids, occurred, sporadically, long, before, the, reign, of, charlemagne, but, exploded, in, frequency, and, size, after, his, death, when, his, empire, fragmented, into, multiple, much, weaker, entities, england, suffered, from, internal, divisions, and, was, a, relatively, easy, prey, given, the, proximity, of, many, towns, to, the, sea, or, to, navigable, rivers, lack, of, organised, naval, opposition, throughout, western, europe, allowed, viking, ships, to, travel, freely, raiding, or, trading, as, opportunity, permitted, the, decline, in, the, profitability, of, old, trade, routes, could, also, have, played, a, role, trade, between, western, europe, and, the, rest, of, eurasia, suffered, a, severe, blow, when, the, western, roman, empire, fell, in, the, 5th, century, the, expansion, of, islam, in, the, 7th, century, had, also, affected, trade, with, western, europe, raids, in, europe, including, raids, and, settlements, from, scandinavia, were, not, unprecedented, and, had, occurred, long, before, the, vikings, arrived, the, jutes, invaded, the, british, isles, three, centuries, earlier, from, jutland, during, the, age, of, migrations, before, the, danes, settled, there, the, saxons, and, the, angles, did, the, same, embarking, from, mainland, europe, the, viking, raids, were, however, the, first, to, be, documented, by, eyewitnesses, and, they, were, much, larger, in, scale, and, frequency, than, in, previous, times, vikings, themselves, were, expanding, although, their, motives, are, unclear, historians, believe, that, scarce, resources, or, a, lack, of, mating, opportunities, were, a, factor, the, highway, of, slaves, was, a, term, for, a, route, that, the, vikings, found, to, have, a, direct, pathway, from, scandinavia, to, constantinople, and, baghdad, while, traveling, on, the, baltic, sea, with, the, advancements, of, their, ships, during, the, 9th, century, the, vikings, were, able, to, sail, to, kievan, rus, and, some, northern, parts, of, europe, jomsborg, was, a, semi, legendary, viking, stronghold, at, the, southern, coast, of, the, baltic, sea, medieval, wendland, modern, pomerania, that, existed, between, the, 960s, and, 1043, its, inhabitants, were, known, as, jomsvikings, jomsborg, s, exact, location, or, its, existence, has, not, yet, been, established, though, it, is, often, maintained, that, jomsborg, was, somewhere, on, the, islands, of, the, oder, estuary, while, the, vikings, were, active, beyond, their, scandinavian, homelands, scandinavia, was, itself, experiencing, new, influences, and, undergoing, a, variety, of, cultural, changes, by, the, late, 11th, century, royal, dynasties, were, legitimised, by, the, catholic, church, which, had, had, little, influence, in, scandinavia, 300, years, earlier, which, were, asserting, their, power, with, increasing, authority, and, ambition, with, the, three, kingdoms, of, denmark, norway, and, sweden, taking, shape, towns, appeared, that, functioned, as, secular, and, ecclesiastical, administrative, centres, and, market, sites, and, monetary, economies, began, to, emerge, based, on, english, and, german, models, by, this, time, the, influx, of, islamic, silver, from, the, east, had, been, absent, for, more, than, a, century, and, the, flow, of, english, silver, had, come, to, an, end, in, the, mid, 11th, century, christianity, had, taken, root, in, denmark, and, norway, with, the, establishment, of, dioceses, in, the, 11th, century, and, the, new, religion, was, beginning, to, organise, and, assert, itself, more, effectively, in, sweden, foreign, churchmen, and, native, elites, were, energetic, in, furthering, the, interests, of, christianity, which, was, now, no, longer, operating, only, on, a, missionary, footing, and, old, ideologies, and, lifestyles, were, transforming, by, 1103, the, first, archbishopric, was, founded, in, scandinavia, at, lund, scania, then, part, of, denmark, the, assimilation, of, the, nascent, scandinavian, kingdoms, into, the, cultural, mainstream, of, european, christendom, altered, the, aspirations, of, scandinavian, rulers, and, of, scandinavians, able, to, travel, overseas, and, changed, their, relations, with, their, neighbours, one, of, the, primary, sources, of, profit, for, the, vikings, had, been, slave, taking, from, other, european, peoples, the, medieval, church, held, that, christians, should, not, own, fellow, christians, as, slaves, so, chattel, slavery, diminished, as, a, practice, throughout, northern, europe, this, took, much, of, the, economic, incentive, out, of, raiding, though, sporadic, slaving, activity, continued, into, the, 11th, century, scandinavian, predation, in, christian, lands, around, the, north, and, irish, seas, diminished, markedly, the, kings, of, norway, continued, to, assert, power, in, parts, of, northern, britain, and, ireland, and, raids, continued, into, the, 12th, century, but, the, military, ambitions, of, scandinavian, rulers, were, now, directed, toward, new, paths, in, 1107, sigurd, i, of, norway, sailed, for, the, eastern, mediterranean, with, norwegian, crusaders, to, fight, for, the, newly, established, kingdom, of, jerusalem, the, kings, of, denmark, and, sweden, participated, actively, in, the, baltic, crusades, of, the, 12th, and, 13th, centuries, a, variety, of, sources, illuminate, the, culture, activities, and, beliefs, of, the, vikings, although, they, were, generally, a, non, literate, culture, that, produced, no, literary, legacy, they, had, an, alphabet, and, described, themselves, and, their, world, on, runestones, most, contemporary, literary, and, written, sources, on, the, vikings, come, from, other, cultures, that, were, in, contact, with, them, since, the, mid, 20th, century, archaeological, findings, have, built, a, more, complete, and, balanced, picture, of, the, lives, of, the, vikings, the, archaeological, record, is, particularly, rich, and, varied, providing, knowledge, of, their, rural, and, urban, settlement, crafts, and, production, ships, and, military, equipment, trading, networks, as, well, as, their, pagan, and, christian, religious, artefacts, and, practices, the, most, important, primary, sources, on, the, vikings, are, contemporary, texts, from, scandinavia, and, regions, where, the, vikings, were, active, writing, in, latin, letters, was, introduced, to, scandinavia, with, christianity, so, there, are, few, native, documentary, sources, from, scandinavia, before, the, late, 11th, and, early, 12th, centuries, the, scandinavians, did, write, inscriptions, in, runes, but, these, were, usually, very, short, and, formulaic, most, contemporary, documentary, sources, consist, of, texts, written, in, christian, and, islamic, communities, outside, scandinavia, often, by, authors, who, had, been, negatively, affected, by, viking, activity, later, writings, on, the, vikings, and, the, viking, age, can, also, be, important, for, understanding, them, and, their, culture, although, they, need, to, be, treated, cautiously, after, the, consolidation, of, the, church, and, the, assimilation, of, scandinavia, and, its, colonies, into, mainstream, medieval, christian, culture, in, the, 11th, and, 12th, centuries, native, written, sources, began, to, appear, in, latin, and, old, norse, in, the, viking, colony, of, iceland, extraordinary, vernacular, literature, blossomed, in, the, 12th, through, 14th, centuries, and, many, traditions, connected, with, the, viking, age, were, written, down, for, the, first, time, in, the, icelandic, sagas, a, literal, interpretation, of, these, medieval, prose, narratives, about, the, vikings, and, the, scandinavian, past, is, doubtful, but, many, specific, elements, remain, worthy, of, consideration, such, as, the, great, quantity, of, skaldic, poetry, attributed, to, court, poets, of, the, 10th, and, 11th, centuries, the, exposed, family, trees, the, self, images, and, the, ethical, values, that, are, contained, in, these, literary, writings, indirectly, the, vikings, have, also, left, a, window, open, onto, their, language, culture, and, activities, through, many, old, norse, place, names, and, words, found, in, their, former, sphere, of, influence, some, of, these, place, names, and, words, are, still, in, direct, use, today, almost, unchanged, and, shed, light, on, where, they, settled, and, what, specific, places, meant, to, them, examples, include, place, names, like, egilsay, from, eigils, ey, meaning, eigil, s, island, ormskirk, from, ormr, kirkja, meaning, orms, church, or, church, of, the, worm, meols, from, merl, meaning, sand, dunes, snaefell, snow, fell, ravenscar, ravens, rock, vinland, land, of, wine, or, land, of, winberry, kaupanger, market, harbour, t, rshavn, thor, s, harbour, and, the, religious, centre, of, odense, meaning, a, place, where, odin, was, worshipped, viking, influence, is, also, evident, in, concepts, like, the, present, day, parliamentary, body, of, the, tynwald, on, the, isle, of, man, many, common, words, in, everyday, english, language, stem, from, the, old, norse, of, the, vikings, and, give, an, opportunity, to, understand, their, interactions, with, the, people, and, cultures, of, the, british, isles, in, the, northern, isles, of, shetland, and, orkney, old, norse, completely, replaced, the, local, languages, and, over, time, evolved, into, the, now, extinct, norn, language, some, modern, words, and, names, only, emerge, and, contribute, to, our, understanding, after, a, more, intense, research, of, linguistic, sources, from, medieval, or, later, records, such, as, york, horse, bay, swansea, sveinn, s, isle, or, some, of, the, place, names, in, normandy, like, tocqueville, toki, s, farm, linguistic, and, etymological, studies, continue, to, provide, a, vital, source, of, information, on, the, viking, culture, their, social, structure, and, history, and, how, they, interacted, with, the, people, and, cultures, they, met, traded, attacked, or, lived, with, in, overseas, settlements, a, lot, of, old, norse, connections, are, evident, in, the, modern, day, languages, of, swedish, norwegian, danish, faroese, and, icelandic, old, norse, did, not, exert, any, great, influence, on, the, slavic, languages, in, the, viking, settlements, of, eastern, europe, it, has, been, speculated, that, the, reason, for, this, was, the, great, differences, between, the, two, languages, combined, with, the, rus, vikings, more, peaceful, businesses, in, these, areas, and, the, fact, that, they, were, outnumbered, the, norse, named, some, of, the, rapids, on, the, dnieper, but, this, can, hardly, be, seen, from, modern, names, the, norse, of, the, viking, age, could, read, and, write, and, used, a, non, standardised, alphabet, called, runor, built, upon, sound, values, while, there, are, few, remains, of, runic, writing, on, paper, from, the, viking, era, thousands, of, stones, with, runic, inscriptions, have, been, found, where, vikings, lived, they, are, usually, in, memory, of, the, dead, though, not, necessarily, placed, at, graves, the, use, of, runor, survived, into, the, 15th, century, used, in, parallel, with, the, latin, alphabet, the, runestones, are, unevenly, distributed, in, scandinavia, denmark, has, 250, runestones, norway, has, 50, while, iceland, has, none, sweden, has, as, many, as, between, 1, 700, and, 2, 500, depending, on, the, definition, the, swedish, district, of, uppland, has, the, highest, concentration, with, as, many, as, 1, 196, inscriptions, in, stone, whereas, s, dermanland, is, second, with, 391, the, majority, of, runic, inscriptions, from, the, viking, period, are, found, in, sweden, many, runestones, in, scandinavia, record, the, names, of, participants, in, viking, expeditions, such, as, the, kjula, runestone, that, tells, of, extensive, warfare, in, western, europe, and, the, turinge, runestone, which, tells, of, a, war, band, in, eastern, europe, other, runestones, mention, men, who, died, on, viking, expeditions, among, them, are, the, england, runestones, swedish, englandsstenarna, which, is, a, group, of, about, 30, runestones, in, sweden, which, refer, to, viking, age, voyages, to, england, they, constitute, one, of, the, largest, groups, of, runestones, that, mention, voyages, to, other, countries, and, they, are, comparable, in, number, only, to, the, approximately, 30, greece, runestones, and, the, 26, ingvar, runestones, the, latter, referring, to, a, viking, expedition, to, the, middle, east, they, were, engraved, in, old, norse, with, the, younger, futhark, the, jelling, stones, date, from, between, 960, and, 985, the, older, smaller, stone, was, raised, by, king, gorm, the, old, the, last, pagan, king, of, denmark, as, a, memorial, honouring, queen, thyre, the, larger, stone, was, raised, by, his, son, harald, bluetooth, to, celebrate, the, conquest, of, denmark, and, norway, and, the, conversion, of, the, danes, to, christianity, it, has, three, sides, one, with, an, animal, image, one, with, an, image, of, the, crucified, jesus, christ, and, a, third, bearing, the, following, inscription, king, haraldr, ordered, this, monument, made, in, memory, of, gormr, his, father, and, in, memory, of, thyrv, his, mother, that, haraldr, who, won, for, himself, all, of, denmark, and, norway, and, made, the, danes, christian, runestones, attest, to, voyages, to, locations, such, as, bath, greece, how, the, vikings, referred, to, the, byzantium, territories, generally, khwaresm, jerusalem, italy, as, langobardland, serkland, i, e, the, muslim, world, england, including, london, and, various, places, in, eastern, europe, viking, age, inscriptions, have, also, been, discovered, on, the, manx, runestones, on, the, isle, of, man, the, last, known, people, to, use, the, runic, alphabet, were, an, isolated, group, of, people, known, as, the, elfdalians, that, lived, in, the, locality, of, lvdalen, in, the, swedish, province, of, dalarna, they, spoke, the, language, of, elfdalian, the, language, unique, to, lvdalen, the, elfdalian, language, differentiates, itself, from, the, other, scandinavian, languages, as, it, evolved, much, closer, to, old, norse, the, people, of, lvdalen, stopped, using, runes, as, late, as, the, 1920s, usage, of, runes, therefore, survived, longer, in, lvdalen, than, anywhere, else, in, the, world, the, last, known, record, of, the, elfdalian, runes, is, from, 1929, they, are, a, variant, of, the, dalecarlian, runes, runic, inscriptions, that, were, also, found, in, dalarna, traditionally, regarded, as, a, swedish, dialect, but, by, several, criteria, closer, related, to, west, scandinavian, dialects, elfdalian, is, a, separate, language, by, the, standard, of, mutual, intelligibility, although, there, is, no, mutual, intelligibility, due, to, schools, and, public, administration, in, lvdalen, being, conducted, in, swedish, native, speakers, are, bilingual, and, speak, swedish, at, a, native, level, residents, in, the, area, who, speak, only, swedish, as, their, sole, native, language, neither, speaking, nor, understanding, elfdalian, are, also, common, lvdalen, can, be, said, to, have, had, its, own, alphabet, during, the, 17th, and, 18th, century, today, there, are, about, 2, 000, 3, 000, native, speakers, of, elfdalian, there, are, numerous, burial, sites, associated, with, vikings, throughout, europe, and, their, sphere, of, influence, in, scandinavia, the, british, isles, ireland, greenland, iceland, faeroe, islands, germany, latvia, estonia, finland, russia, etc, the, burial, practices, of, the, vikings, were, quite, varied, from, dug, graves, in, the, ground, to, tumuli, sometimes, including, so, called, ship, burials, according, to, written, sources, most, of, the, funerals, took, place, at, sea, funerals, involved, either, burial, or, cremation, depending, on, local, customs, in, the, area, that, is, now, sweden, cremations, were, predominant, in, denmark, burial, was, more, common, and, in, norway, both, were, common, viking, barrows, are, one, of, the, primary, sources, of, evidence, for, circumstances, in, the, viking, age, the, items, buried, with, the, dead, give, some, indication, as, to, what, was, considered, important, to, possess, in, the, afterlife, it, is, unknown, what, mortuary, services, were, given, to, dead, children, by, the, vikings, some, of, the, most, important, burial, sites, for, understanding, the, vikings, include, there, have, been, several, archaeological, finds, of, viking, ships, of, all, sizes, providing, knowledge, of, the, craftsmanship, that, went, into, building, them, there, were, many, types, of, viking, ships, built, for, various, uses, the, best, known, type, is, probably, the, longship, longships, were, intended, for, warfare, and, exploration, designed, for, speed, and, agility, and, were, equipped, with, oars, to, complement, the, sail, making, navigation, possible, independently, of, the, wind, the, longship, had, a, long, narrow, hull, and, shallow, draught, to, facilitate, landings, and, troop, deployments, in, shallow, water, longships, were, used, extensively, by, the, leidang, the, scandinavian, defence, fleets, the, longship, allowed, the, norse, to, go, viking, which, might, explain, why, this, type, of, ship, has, become, almost, synonymous, with, the, concept, of, vikings, the, vikings, built, many, unique, types, of, watercraft, often, used, for, more, peaceful, tasks, the, knarr, was, a, dedicated, merchant, vessel, designed, to, carry, cargo, in, bulk, it, had, a, broader, hull, a, deeper, draught, and, a, small, number, of, oars, used, primarily, to, manoeuvre, in, harbours, and, similar, situations, one, viking, innovation, was, the, beitass, a, spar, mounted, to, the, sail, that, allowed, their, ships, to, sail, effectively, against, the, wind, it, was, common, for, seafaring, viking, ships, to, tow, or, carry, a, smaller, boat, to, transfer, crew, and, cargo, from, the, ship, to, shore, ships, were, an, integral, part, of, viking, culture, they, facilitated, everyday, transportation, across, seas, and, waterways, exploration, of, new, lands, raids, conquests, and, trade, with, neighbouring, cultures, they, also, held, a, major, religious, importance, people, with, high, status, were, sometimes, buried, in, a, ship, along, with, animal, sacrifices, weapons, provisions, and, other, items, as, evidenced, by, the, buried, vessels, at, gokstad, and, oseberg, in, norway, and, the, excavated, ship, burial, at, ladby, in, denmark, ship, burials, were, also, practised, by, vikings, overseas, as, evidenced, by, the, excavations, of, the, salme, ships, on, the, estonian, island, of, saaremaa, well, preserved, remains, of, five, viking, ships, were, excavated, from, roskilde, fjord, in, the, late, 1960s, representing, both, the, longship, and, the, knarr, the, ships, were, scuttled, there, in, the, 11th, century, to, block, a, navigation, channel, and, thus, protect, roskilde, then, the, danish, capital, from, a, seaborne, assault, the, remains, of, these, ships, are, on, display, at, the, viking, ship, museum, in, roskilde, in, 2019, archaeologists, uncovered, two, viking, boat, graves, in, gamla, uppsala, they, also, discovered, that, one, of, the, boats, still, holds, the, remains, of, a, man, a, dog, and, a, horse, along, with, other, items, this, has, shed, light, on, the, death, rituals, of, viking, communities, in, the, region, viking, society, was, divided, into, the, three, socio, economic, classes, thralls, karls, and, jarls, this, is, described, vividly, in, the, eddic, poem, of, r, gs, ula, which, also, explains, that, it, was, the, god, r, g, father, of, mankind, also, known, as, heimdallr, who, created, the, three, classes, archaeology, has, confirmed, this, social, structure, thralls, were, the, lowest, ranking, class, and, were, slaves, slaves, comprised, as, much, as, a, quarter, of, the, population, slavery, was, vital, to, viking, society, for, everyday, chores, and, large, scale, construction, and, also, for, trading, and, for, the, economy, thralls, were, servants, and, workers, on, the, farms, and, in, larger, households, of, the, karls, and, jarls, and, they, were, used, for, constructing, fortifications, ramps, canals, mounds, roads, and, similar, projects, built, by, hard, labour, according, to, the, r, gs, ula, thralls, were, despised, and, looked, down, upon, new, thralls, were, supplied, by, either, the, sons, and, daughters, of, thralls, or, were, captured, abroad, by, the, vikings, on, their, raids, in, europe, the, thralls, were, brought, back, to, scandinavia, by, boat, used, on, location, or, in, newer, settlements, to, build, needed, structures, or, sold, often, to, the, arabs, in, exchange, for, silver, other, names, for, thrall, were, tr, l, and, ty, karls, were, free, peasants, they, owned, farms, land, and, cattle, and, engaged, in, chores, like, ploughing, the, fields, milking, the, cows, and, building, houses, and, wagons, but, used, thralls, to, make, ends, meet, other, names, for, karls, were, bonde, or, simply, free, men, similar, classes, were, churl, s, and, huskarls, the, jarls, were, the, aristocracy, of, viking, society, they, were, wealthy, and, owned, large, estates, with, huge, longhouses, horses, and, many, thralls, the, thralls, did, most, of, the, daily, chores, while, the, jarls, carried, out, administration, politics, hunting, and, sports, they, also, visited, other, jarls, or, went, abroad, on, expeditions, when, a, jarl, died, and, was, buried, his, household, thralls, were, sometimes, sacrificially, killed, and, buried, next, to, him, as, many, excavations, have, revealed, in, daily, life, there, were, many, intermediate, positions, in, the, overall, social, structure, and, it, appears, that, there, was, some, social, mobility, between, them, these, details, are, unclear, but, titles, and, positions, like, hauldr, thegn, and, landmand, show, mobility, between, the, karls, and, the, jarls, other, social, structures, included, the, communities, of, f, lag, in, both, the, civil, and, the, military, spheres, to, which, its, members, called, f, lagi, were, obliged, a, f, lag, could, be, centred, around, certain, trades, a, common, ownership, of, a, sea, vessel, or, a, military, obligation, under, a, specific, leader, members, of, the, latter, were, referred, to, as, drenge, one, of, the, words, for, warrior, there, were, also, official, communities, within, towns, and, villages, the, overall, defence, religion, the, legal, system, and, the, things, like, elsewhere, in, medieval, europe, most, women, in, viking, society, were, subordinate, to, their, husbands, and, fathers, and, had, little, political, power, however, written, sources, portray, free, viking, women, as, having, independence, and, rights, viking, women, generally, appear, to, have, had, more, freedom, than, women, elsewhere, as, illustrated, in, the, icelandic, gr, g, s, and, the, norwegian, frostating, laws, and, gulating, laws, most, free, viking, women, were, housewives, and, a, woman, s, standing, in, society, was, linked, to, that, of, her, husband, marriage, gave, a, woman, a, degree, of, economic, security, and, social, standing, encapsulated, in, the, title, h, sfreyja, lady, of, the, house, norse, laws, assert, the, housewife, s, authority, over, the, indoor, household, she, had, the, important, roles, of, managing, the, farm, s, resources, conducting, business, as, well, as, child, rearing, although, some, of, this, would, be, shared, with, her, husband, after, the, age, of, 20, an, unmarried, woman, referred, to, as, maer, and, mey, reached, legal, majority, and, had, the, right, to, decide, her, place, of, residence, and, was, regarded, as, her, own, person, before, the, law, an, exception, to, her, independence, was, the, right, to, choose, a, husband, as, marriages, were, normally, arranged, by, the, family, the, groom, would, pay, a, bride, price, mundr, to, the, bride, s, family, and, the, bride, brought, assets, into, the, marriage, as, a, dowry, a, married, woman, could, divorce, her, husband, and, remarry, concubinage, was, also, part, of, viking, society, whereby, a, woman, could, live, with, a, man, and, have, children, with, him, without, marrying, such, a, woman, was, called, a, frilla, usually, she, would, be, the, mistress, of, a, wealthy, and, powerful, man, who, also, had, a, wife, the, wife, had, authority, over, the, mistresses, if, they, lived, in, her, household, through, her, relationship, to, a, man, of, higher, social, standing, a, concubine, and, her, family, could, advance, socially, although, her, position, was, less, secure, than, that, of, a, wife, there, was, little, distinction, made, between, children, born, inside, or, outside, marriage, both, had, the, right, to, inherit, property, from, their, parents, and, there, were, no, legitimate, or, illegitimate, children, however, children, born, in, wedlock, had, more, inheritance, rights, than, those, born, out, of, wedlock, a, woman, had, the, right, to, inherit, part, of, her, husband, s, property, upon, his, death, and, widows, enjoyed, the, same, independent, status, as, unmarried, women, the, paternal, aunt, paternal, niece, and, paternal, granddaughter, referred, to, as, odalkvinna, all, had, the, right, to, inherit, property, from, a, deceased, man, a, woman, with, no, husband, sons, or, male, relatives, could, inherit, not, only, property, but, also, the, position, as, head, of, the, family, when, her, father, or, brother, died, such, a, woman, was, referred, to, as, baugrygr, and, she, exercised, all, the, rights, afforded, to, the, head, of, a, family, clan, until, she, married, by, which, her, rights, were, transferred, to, her, new, husband, women, had, religious, authority, and, were, active, as, priestesses, gydja, and, oracles, sejdkvinna, they, were, active, within, art, as, poets, skalder, and, rune, masters, and, as, merchants, and, medicine, women, there, may, also, have, been, female, entrepreneurs, who, worked, in, textile, production, women, may, also, have, been, active, within, military, offices, the, tales, about, shieldmaidens, are, unconfirmed, but, some, archaeological, finds, such, as, the, birka, female, viking, warrior, may, indicate, that, at, least, some, women, in, military, authority, existed, these, liberties, of, the, viking, women, gradually, disappeared, after, the, introduction, of, christianity, and, from, the, late, 13th, century, they, are, no, longer, mentioned, examination, of, viking, age, burials, suggests, that, women, lived, longer, and, nearly, all, well, past, the, age, of, 35, as, compared, to, earlier, times, female, graves, from, before, the, viking, age, in, scandinavia, hold, a, proportionally, large, number, of, remains, from, women, aged, 20, to, 35, presumably, due, to, complications, of, childbirth, examination, of, skeletal, remains, also, allows, the, relative, health, and, nutritional, status, of, boys, and, girls, in, the, past, to, be, reconstructed, using, anthropometric, techniques, burials, from, scandinavia, and, other, european, countries, suggest, that, in, comparison, with, other, societies, at, the, time, female, equality, was, remarkably, high, in, rural, scandinavia, females, in, the, rural, periphery, of, nordic, countries, during, the, viking, period, and, the, later, middle, ages, had, relatively, high, status, resulting, in, substantial, nutritional, and, health, resources, being, allocated, to, girls, enabling, them, to, grow, stronger, and, healthier, scandinavian, vikings, were, similar, in, appearance, to, modern, scandinavians, their, skin, was, fair, and, the, hair, color, varied, between, blond, dark, and, reddish, genetic, studies, suggest, that, people, were, mostly, blond, in, what, is, now, eastern, sweden, while, red, hair, was, mostly, found, in, western, scandinavia, most, viking, men, had, shoulder, length, hair, and, beards, and, slaves, thralls, were, usually, the, only, men, with, short, hair, the, length, varied, according, to, personal, preference, and, occupation, men, involved, in, warfare, for, example, may, have, had, slightly, shorter, hair, and, beards, for, practical, reasons, men, in, some, regions, bleached, their, hair, a, golden, saffron, colour, females, also, had, long, hair, with, girls, often, wearing, it, loose, or, braided, and, married, women, often, wearing, it, in, a, bun, the, average, height, is, estimated, to, have, been, 1, 70, m, 5, ft, 7, in, for, men, and, 1, 55, m, 5, ft, 1, in, for, women, the, three, classes, were, easily, recognisable, by, their, appearance, men, and, women, of, the, jarls, were, well, groomed, with, neat, hairstyles, and, expressed, their, wealth, and, status, by, wearing, expensive, clothes, often, silk, and, well, crafted, jewellery, like, brooches, belt, buckles, necklaces, and, arm, rings, almost, all, of, the, jewellery, was, crafted, in, specific, designs, unique, to, the, norse, see, viking, art, finger, rings, were, seldom, used, and, earrings, were, not, used, at, all, as, they, were, seen, as, a, slavic, phenomenon, most, karls, expressed, similar, tastes, and, hygiene, but, in, a, more, relaxed, and, inexpensive, way, archaeological, finds, from, scandinavia, and, viking, settlements, in, the, british, isles, support, the, idea, of, the, well, groomed, and, hygienic, viking, burial, with, grave, goods, was, a, common, practice, in, the, scandinavian, world, through, the, viking, age, and, well, past, the, christianisation, of, the, norse, peoples, within, these, burial, sites, and, homesteads, combs, often, made, from, antler, are, a, common, find, the, manufacturing, of, such, antler, combs, was, common, as, at, the, viking, settlement, at, dublin, hundreds, of, examples, of, combs, from, the, tenth, century, have, survived, suggesting, that, grooming, was, a, common, practice, the, manufacture, of, such, combs, was, also, widespread, throughout, the, viking, world, as, examples, of, similar, combs, have, been, found, at, viking, settlements, in, ireland, england, and, scotland, the, combs, share, a, common, visual, appearance, as, well, with, the, extant, examples, often, decorated, with, linear, interlacing, and, geometric, motifs, or, other, forms, of, ornamentation, depending, on, the, comb, s, period, and, type, but, stylistically, similar, to, viking, age, art, all, levels, of, viking, age, society, appear, to, have, groomed, their, hair, as, hair, combs, have, been, found, in, common, graves, as, well, as, in, aristocratic, ones, the, sagas, tell, about, the, diet, and, cuisine, of, the, vikings, but, first, hand, evidence, like, cesspits, kitchen, middens, and, garbage, dumps, have, proved, to, be, of, great, value, and, importance, undigested, remains, of, plants, from, cesspits, at, coppergate, in, york, have, provided, much, information, in, this, respect, overall, archaeo, botanical, investigations, have, been, undertaken, increasingly, in, recent, decades, as, a, collaboration, between, archaeologists, and, palaeoethno, botanists, this, new, approach, sheds, light, on, the, agricultural, and, horticultural, practices, of, the, vikings, and, their, cuisine, the, combined, information, from, various, sources, suggests, a, diverse, cuisine, and, ingredients, meat, products, of, all, kinds, such, as, cured, smoked, and, whey, preserved, meat, sausages, and, boiled, or, fried, fresh, meat, cuts, were, prepared, and, consumed, there, were, plenty, of, seafood, bread, porridges, dairy, products, vegetables, fruits, berries, and, nuts, alcoholic, drinks, like, beer, mead, bj, rr, a, strong, fruit, wine, and, for, the, rich, imported, wine, were, served, certain, livestock, were, typical, and, unique, to, the, vikings, including, the, icelandic, horse, icelandic, cattle, a, plethora, of, sheep, breeds, the, danish, hen, and, the, danish, goose, the, vikings, in, york, mostly, ate, beef, mutton, and, pork, with, small, amounts, of, horse, meat, most, of, the, beef, and, horse, leg, bones, were, found, split, lengthways, to, extract, the, marrow, the, mutton, and, swine, were, cut, into, leg, and, shoulder, joints, and, chops, the, frequent, remains, of, pig, skull, and, foot, bones, found, on, house, floors, indicate, that, brawn, and, trotters, were, also, popular, hens, were, kept, for, both, their, meat, and, eggs, and, the, bones, of, game, birds, such, as, black, grouse, golden, plover, wild, ducks, and, geese, have, also, been, found, seafood, was, important, in, some, places, even, more, so, than, meat, whales, and, walrus, were, hunted, for, food, in, norway, and, the, northwestern, parts, of, the, north, atlantic, region, and, seals, were, hunted, nearly, everywhere, oysters, mussels, and, shrimp, were, eaten, in, large, quantities, and, cod, and, salmon, were, popular, fish, in, the, southern, regions, herring, was, also, important, milk, and, buttermilk, were, popular, both, as, cooking, ingredients, and, drinks, but, were, not, always, available, even, at, farms, milk, came, from, cows, goats, and, sheep, with, priorities, varying, from, location, to, location, and, fermented, milk, products, like, skyr, or, surmj, lk, were, produced, as, well, as, butter, and, cheese, food, was, often, salted, and, enhanced, with, spices, some, of, which, were, imported, like, black, pepper, while, others, were, cultivated, in, herb, gardens, or, harvested, in, the, wild, home, grown, spices, included, caraway, mustard, and, horseradish, as, evidenced, from, the, oseberg, ship, burial, or, dill, coriander, and, wild, celery, as, found, in, cesspits, at, coppergate, in, york, thyme, juniper, berry, sweet, gale, yarrow, rue, and, peppercress, were, also, used, and, cultivated, in, herb, gardens, vikings, collected, and, ate, fruits, berries, and, nuts, apple, wild, crab, apples, plums, and, cherries, were, part, of, the, diet, as, were, rose, hips, and, raspberry, wild, strawberry, blackberry, elderberry, rowan, hawthorn, and, various, wild, berries, specific, to, the, locations, hazelnuts, were, an, important, part, of, the, diet, in, general, and, large, amounts, of, walnut, shells, have, been, found, in, cities, like, hedeby, the, shells, were, used, for, dyeing, and, it, is, assumed, that, the, nuts, were, consumed, the, invention, and, introduction, of, the, mouldboard, plough, revolutionised, agriculture, in, scandinavia, in, the, early, viking, age, and, made, it, possible, to, farm, even, poor, soils, in, ribe, grains, of, rye, barley, oat, and, wheat, dated, to, the, 8th, century, have, been, found, and, examined, and, are, believed, to, have, been, cultivated, locally, grains, and, flour, were, used, for, making, porridges, some, cooked, with, milk, some, cooked, with, fruit, and, sweetened, with, honey, and, also, various, forms, of, bread, remains, of, bread, from, primarily, birka, in, sweden, were, made, of, barley, and, wheat, it, is, unclear, if, the, norse, leavened, their, breads, but, their, ovens, and, baking, utensils, suggest, that, they, did, flax, was, a, very, important, crop, for, the, vikings, it, was, used, for, oil, extraction, food, consumption, and, most, importantly, the, production, of, linen, more, than, 40, of, all, known, textile, recoveries, from, the, viking, age, can, be, traced, as, linen, this, suggests, a, much, higher, actual, percentage, as, linen, is, poorly, preserved, compared, to, wool, for, example, the, quality, of, food, for, common, people, was, not, always, particularly, high, the, research, at, coppergate, shows, that, the, vikings, in, york, made, bread, from, wholemeal, flour, probably, both, wheat, and, rye, but, with, the, seeds, of, cornfield, weeds, included, corncockle, agrostemma, would, have, made, the, bread, dark, coloured, but, the, seeds, are, poisonous, and, people, who, ate, the, bread, might, have, become, ill, seeds, of, carrots, parsnip, and, brassicas, were, also, discovered, but, they, were, poor, specimens, and, tend, to, come, from, white, carrots, and, bitter, tasting, cabbages, the, rotary, querns, often, used, in, the, viking, age, left, tiny, stone, fragments, often, from, basalt, rock, in, the, flour, which, when, eaten, wore, down, the, teeth, the, effects, of, this, can, be, seen, on, skeletal, remains, from, that, period, sports, were, widely, practised, and, encouraged, by, the, vikings, sports, that, involved, weapons, training, and, developing, combat, skills, were, popular, these, included, spear, and, stone, throwing, building, and, testing, physical, strength, through, wrestling, see, glima, fist, fighting, and, stone, lifting, in, areas, with, mountains, mountain, climbing, was, practised, as, a, sport, agility, and, balance, were, built, and, tested, by, running, and, jumping, for, sport, and, there, is, mention, of, a, sport, that, involved, jumping, from, oar, to, oar, on, the, outside, of, a, ship, s, railing, as, it, was, being, rowed, swimming, was, a, popular, sport, snorri, sturluson, describes, three, types, diving, long, distance, swimming, and, a, contest, in, which, two, swimmers, try, to, dunk, one, another, children, often, participated, in, some, of, the, sport, disciplines, and, women, have, also, been, mentioned, as, swimmers, although, it, is, unclear, if, they, took, part, in, competitions, king, olaf, tryggvason, was, acclaimed, for, his, skill, in, both, mountain, climbing, and, oar, jumping, and, reputedly, excelled, in, the, art, of, knife, juggling, as, well, skiing, and, ice, skating, were, the, principal, winter, sports, and, also, provided, transport, on, snow, and, ice, for, adults, horse, fighting, was, practised, for, sport, although, the, rules, are, unclear, it, appears, to, have, involved, two, stallions, pitted, against, each, other, within, smell, and, sight, of, fenced, off, mares, whatever, the, rules, were, the, fights, often, resulted, in, the, death, of, one, of, the, stallions, icelandic, sources, often, mention, knattleik, a, ball, game, similar, to, hockey, played, with, a, bat, and, a, small, hard, ball, usually, on, a, smooth, surface, of, ice, popular, with, both, adults, and, children, it, was, a, rugged, game, that, often, led, to, injuries, knattleik, appears, to, have, been, played, only, in, iceland, where, it, attracted, many, spectators, as, did, horse, fighting, hunting, was, practiced, as, a, sport, only, in, denmark, where, it, was, not, an, essential, food, source, deer, and, hares, were, hunted, for, meat, along, with, partridges, and, sea, birds, while, foxes, were, hunted, to, stop, their, killing, of, farm, animals, and, for, their, furs, spears, bows, and, later, crossbows, were, the, weapons, used, stalking, was, the, most, common, method, although, game, was, also, chased, with, dogs, numerous, kinds, of, snares, and, traps, were, used, as, well, archaeological, finds, and, written, sources, indicate, that, the, vikings, participated, in, social, gatherings, and, festivities, board, games, and, dice, games, were, a, popular, pastime, game, boards, were, made, of, ornately, carved, wood, with, gaming, pieces, fashioned, mostly, from, wood, bone, or, stone, pieces, were, also, made, of, glass, amber, and, antler, along, with, materials, such, as, walrus, tusk, and, ivory, from, foreign, sources, the, vikings, played, several, types, of, tafl, games, hnefatafl, nitavl, nine, men, s, morris, and, the, less, common, kvatrutafl, hnefatafl, was, probably, the, oldest, type, of, board, game, played, in, medieval, scandinavia, the, archaeological, record, indicates, that, hnefatafl, was, popular, by, the, early, medieval, period, with, the, vikings, introducing, it, to, england, scotland, wales, and, ireland, the, ockelbo, runestone, shows, two, men, possibly, playing, hnefatafl, and, one, saga, suggests, that, dice, games, involved, gambling, beer, and, mead, were, served, on, festive, occasions, where, music, was, played, poetry, was, recited, and, stories, were, told, music, was, considered, an, art, form, and, musical, skill, was, viewed, as, suitable, for, a, cultivated, man, the, vikings, are, known, to, have, played, instruments, including, harps, lutes, lyres, and, fiddles, elements, of, a, scandinavian, identity, and, practices, were, maintained, in, settler, societies, but, they, could, be, quite, distinct, as, the, groups, assimilated, into, neighbouring, societies, assimilation, to, the, frankish, culture, in, normandy, for, example, was, rapid, links, to, a, viking, identity, remained, longer, in, the, remote, islands, of, iceland, and, the, faroes, knowledge, about, the, arms, and, armour, of, the, viking, age, is, based, on, archaeological, finds, pictorial, representation, and, to, some, extent, on, the, accounts, in, the, norse, sagas, and, norse, laws, recorded, in, the, 13th, century, according, to, custom, all, free, norse, men, were, required, to, own, weapons, and, were, permitted, to, carry, them, at, all, times, these, arms, indicated, a, viking, s, social, status, a, wealthy, viking, had, a, complete, ensemble, of, a, helmet, shield, mail, shirt, and, sword, however, swords, were, rarely, used, in, battle, they, were, probably, not, sturdy, enough, for, combat, and, most, likely, only, used, as, symbolic, or, decorative, items, a, typical, b, ndi, freeman, was, more, likely, to, fight, with, a, spear, and, shield, and, most, also, carried, a, seax, as, a, utility, knife, and, side, arm, bows, were, used, in, the, opening, stages, of, land, battles, and, at, sea, but, they, tended, to, be, considered, less, honourable, than, melee, weapons, vikings, were, relatively, unusual, for, the, time, in, their, use, of, axes, as, a, main, battle, weapon, the, h, scarls, the, elite, guard, of, king, cnut, and, later, of, king, harold, ii, were, armed, with, two, handed, axes, that, could, split, shields, or, metal, helmets, with, ease, the, warfare, and, violence, of, the, vikings, were, often, motivated, and, fuelled, by, their, beliefs, in, norse, religion, focusing, on, thor, and, odin, the, gods, of, war, and, death, violence, was, common, in, viking, age, norway, an, examination, of, norwegian, human, remains, from, the, viking, age, found, that, 72, of, the, examined, males, and, 42, of, the, examined, females, had, suffered, weapon, related, injuries, violence, was, less, common, in, viking, age, denmark, where, society, was, more, centralized, and, complex, than, the, clan, based, norwegian, society, the, viking, warrior, is, often, associated, with, violent, fits, of, rage, and, frenzied, fighting, in, modern, popular, culture, as, reflected, in, meanings, attached, to, the, words, berserkergang, and, berserker, that, would, not, have, been, the, meanings, understood, by, medieval, norse, society, such, a, fighting, style, may, have, been, deployed, intentionally, by, shock, troops, and, it, has, been, proposed, that, the, berserk, state, may, have, been, induced, by, consuming, large, amounts, of, alcohol, or, through, ingestion, of, materials, with, psychoactive, properties, such, as, the, solanaceous, plant, hyoscyamus, niger, as, speculated, by, karsten, fatur, or, by, consumption, of, the, hallucinogenic, mushroom, amanita, muscaria, as, first, hypothesised, by, the, swedish, theologian, samuel, dman, in, 1784, and, later, by, the, botanist, f, c, sch, beler, in, 1885, the, norwegian, battlefield, archaeologist, are, skarstein, kolberg, asserts, that, dman, s, hypothesis, is, not, supported, by, the, saga, literature, or, by, the, archaeological, record, and, according, to, roderick, dale, there, is, no, evidence, for, it, from, the, viking, age, or, from, old, norse, literature, the, vikings, established, and, engaged, in, extensive, trading, networks, throughout, the, known, world, and, had, a, profound, influence, on, the, economic, development, of, europe, and, scandinavia, other, than, in, such, trading, centres, as, ribe, hedeby, in, denmark, scandinavia, was, unfamiliar, with, the, use, of, coinage, therefore, its, economy, was, based, on, bullion, that, is, the, purity, and, weight, of, precious, metals, used, in, exchange, silver, was, the, precious, metal, most, commonly, used, although, gold, was, also, used, traders, carried, small, portable, scales, enabling, them, to, measure, weight, precisely, which, allowed, an, accurate, medium, of, exchange, even, lacking, a, regular, coinage, organised, trade, covered, everything, from, ordinary, items, in, bulk, to, exotic, luxury, products, the, viking, ship, designs, like, that, of, the, knarr, were, an, important, factor, in, their, success, as, merchants, imported, goods, from, other, cultures, included, to, counter, these, valuable, imports, the, vikings, exported, a, large, variety, of, goods, these, goods, included, other, exports, included, weapons, walrus, ivory, wax, salt, and, cod, as, one, of, the, more, exotic, exports, hunting, birds, were, sometimes, provided, from, norway, to, the, european, aristocracy, from, the, 10th, century, many, of, these, goods, were, also, traded, within, the, viking, world, itself, as, well, as, goods, such, as, soapstone, and, whetstone, soapstone, was, traded, with, the, norse, on, iceland, and, in, jutland, who, used, it, for, pottery, whetstones, were, traded, and, used, for, sharpening, weapons, tools, and, knives, there, are, indications, from, ribe, and, surrounding, areas, that, the, extensive, medieval, trade, with, oxen, and, cattle, from, jutland, see, ox, road, reach, as, far, back, as, c, 720, ad, this, trade, satisfied, the, vikings, need, for, leather, and, meat, to, some, extent, and, perhaps, hides, for, parchment, production, on, the, european, mainland, wool, was, also, very, important, as, a, domestic, product, for, the, vikings, to, produce, warm, clothing, for, the, cold, scandinavian, and, nordic, climate, and, for, sails, sails, for, viking, ships, required, large, amounts, of, wool, as, evidenced, by, experimental, archaeology, there, are, archaeological, signs, of, organised, textile, productions, in, scandinavia, reaching, as, far, back, as, the, early, iron, ages, artisans, and, craftsmen, in, the, larger, towns, were, supplied, with, antlers, from, organised, hunting, with, large, scale, reindeer, traps, in, the, far, north, they, were, used, as, raw, material, for, making, everyday, utensils, like, combs, in, england, the, viking, age, began, dramatically, on, 8, june, 793, when, norsemen, destroyed, the, abbey, on, the, island, of, lindisfarne, the, devastation, of, northumbria, s, holy, island, shocked, and, alerted, the, royal, courts, of, europe, to, the, viking, presence, never, before, has, such, an, atrocity, been, seen, declared, the, northumbrian, scholar, alcuin, of, york, medieval, christians, in, europe, were, totally, unprepared, for, the, viking, incursions, and, could, find, no, explanation, for, their, arrival, and, the, accompanying, suffering, they, experienced, at, their, hands, save, the, wrath, of, god, more, than, any, other, single, event, the, attack, on, lindisfarne, demonised, perception, of, the, vikings, for, the, next, twelve, centuries, not, until, the, 1890s, did, scholars, outside, scandinavia, begin, to, seriously, reassess, the, achievements, of, the, vikings, recognising, their, artistry, technological, skills, and, seamanship, norse, mythology, sagas, and, literature, tell, of, scandinavian, culture, and, religion, through, tales, of, heroic, and, mythological, heroes, early, transmission, of, this, information, was, primarily, oral, and, later, texts, relied, on, the, writings, and, transcriptions, of, christian, scholars, including, the, icelanders, snorri, sturluson, and, s, mundur, fr, i, many, of, these, sagas, were, written, in, iceland, and, most, of, them, even, if, they, had, no, icelandic, provenance, were, preserved, there, after, the, middle, ages, due, to, the, continued, interest, of, icelanders, in, norse, literature, and, legal, codes, the, 200, year, viking, influence, on, european, history, is, filled, with, tales, of, plunder, and, colonisation, and, the, majority, of, these, chronicles, came, from, western, european, witnesses, and, their, descendants, less, common, although, equally, relevant, are, references, to, vikings, in, chronicles, that, originated, in, the, east, including, the, nestor, chronicles, novgorod, chronicles, ibn, fadlan, chronicles, ibn, rusta, chronicles, and, brief, mentions, by, photius, patriarch, of, constantinople, regarding, the, first, viking, attack, on, the, byzantine, empire, other, chroniclers, of, viking, history, include, adam, of, bremen, who, wrote, in, the, fourth, volume, of, his,

increased, during, the, 17th, century, with, latin, translations, of, the, edda, notably, peder, resen, s, edda, islandorum, of, 1665, in, scandinavia, the, 17th, century, danish, scholars, thomas, bartholin, and, ole, worm, and, the, swede, olaus, rudbeck, used, runic, inscriptions, and, icelandic, sagas, as, historical, sources, an, important, early, british, contributor, to, the, study, of, the, vikings, was, george, hickes, who, published, his, linguarum, vett, septentrionalium, thesaurus, dictionary, of, the, old, northern, languages, in, 1703, 05, during, the, 18th, century, british, interest, and, enthusiasm, for, iceland, and, early, scandinavian, culture, grew, dramatically, expressed, in, english, translations, of, old, norse, texts, and, in, original, poems, that, extolled, the, supposed, viking, virtues, the, word, viking, was, first, popularised, at, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, by, erik, gustaf, geijer, in, his, poem, the, viking, geijer, s, poem, did, much, to, propagate, the, new, romanticised, ideal, of, the, viking, which, had, little, basis, in, historical, fact, the, renewed, interest, of, romanticism, in, the, old, north, had, contemporary, political, implications, the, geatish, society, of, which, geijer, was, a, member, popularised, this, myth, to, a, great, extent, another, swedish, author, who, had, great, influence, on, the, perception, of, the, vikings, was, esaias, tegn, r, a, member, of, the, geatish, society, who, wrote, a, modern, version, of, fri, j, fs, saga, hins, fr, kna, which, became, widely, popular, in, the, nordic, countries, the, united, kingdom, and, germany, fascination, with, the, vikings, reached, a, peak, during, the, so, called, viking, revival, in, the, late, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, as, a,

identify, the, viking, age, origins, of, rural, idioms, and, proverbs, the, new, dictionaries, of, the, old, norse, language, enabled, the, victorians, to, grapple, with, the, primary, icelandic, sagas, until, recently, the, history, of, the, viking, age, was, largely, based, on, icelandic, sagas, the, history, of, the, danes, written, by, saxo, grammaticus, the, primary, chronicle, and, cogad, g, edel, re, gallaib, few, scholars, still, accept, these, texts, as, reliable, sources, as, historians, now, rely, more, on, archaeology, and, numismatics, disciplines, that, have, made, valuable, contributions, toward, understanding, the, period, the, romanticised, idea, of, the, vikings, constructed, in, scholarly, and, popular, circles, in, northwestern, europe, in, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, was, a, potent, one, and, the, figure, of, the, viking, became, a, familiar, and, malleable, symbol, in, different, contexts, in, the, politics, and, political, ideologies, of, 20th, century, europe, in, normandy, which, had, been, settled, by, vikings, the, viking, ship, became, an, uncontroversial, regional, symbol, in, germany, awareness, of, viking, history, in, the, 19th, century, had, been, stimulated, by, the, border, dispute, with, denmark, over, schleswig, holstein, and, the, use, of, scandinavian, mythology, by, richard, wagner, the, idealised, view, of, the, vikings, appealed, to, germanic, supremacists, who, transformed, the, figure, of, the, viking, in, accordance, with, the, ideology, of, a, germanic, master, race, building, on, the, linguistic, and, cultural, connections, between, norse, speaking, scandinavians, and, other, germanic, groups, in, the, distant, past, scandinavian, vikings, were, portrayed, in, nazi, germany, as, a, pure, germanic, type, the, cultural, phenomenon, of, viking, expansion, was, re, interpreted, for, use, as, propaganda, to, support, the, extreme, militant, nationalism, of, the, third, reich, and, ideologically, informed, interpretations, of, viking, paganism, and, the, scandinavian, use, of, runes, were, employed, in, the, construction, of, nazi, mysticism, other, political, organisations, of, the, same, ilk, such, as, the, former, norwegian, fascist, party, nasjonal, samling, similarly, appropriated, elements, of, the, modern, viking, cultural, myth, in, their, symbolism, and, propaganda,

rus, they, accused, normanist, theory, proponents, of, distorting, history, by, depicting, the, slavs, as, undeveloped, primitives, in, contrast, soviet, historians, stated, that, the, slavs, laid, the, foundations, of, their, statehood, long, before, the, norman, viking, raids, while, the, norman, viking, invasions, only, served, to, hinder, the, historical, development, of, the, slavs, they, argued, that, rus, composition, was, slavic, and, that, rurik, and, oleg, s, success, was, rooted, in, their, support, from, within, the, local, slavic, aristocracy, after, the, dissolution, of, the,

nibelungen, vikings, and, the, romanticist, viking, revival, have, inspired, many, creative, works, these, have, included, novels, directly, based, on, historical, events, such, as, frans, gunnar, bengtsson, s, the, long, ships, which, was, also, released, as, a, 1963, film, and, historical, fantasies, such, as, the, film, the, vikings, michael, crichton, s, eaters, of, the, dead, movie,

television, has, seen, a, resurgence, in, recent, decades, especially, with, the, history, channel, s, series, vikings, 2013, directed, by, michael, hirst, the, show, has, a, loose, grounding, in, historical, facts, and, sources, but, bases, itself, more, so, on, literary, sources, such, as, fornaldarsaga, ragnars, saga, lo, br, kar, itself, more, legend, than, fact, and, old, norse, eddic, and, skaldic, poetry, the, events, of, the, show, frequently, make, references, to, the, v, lusp, an, eddic, poem, describing, the, creation, of, the, world, often, directly, referencing, specific, lines, of, the, poem, in, the, dialogue, the, show, portrays, some, of, the, social, realities, of, the, medieval, scandinavian, world, such, as, slavery, and, the, greater, role, of, women, within, viking, society, the, show, also, addresses, the, topics, of, gender, equity, in, viking, society, with, the, inclusion, of, shield, maidens, through, the, character, lagertha, also, based, on, a, legendary, figure, recent, archaeological, interpretations, and, osteological, analyses, of, previous, excavations, of, viking, burials, have, given, support, to, the, idea, of, the, viking, woman, warrior, namely, the, excavation, and, dna, study, of, the, birka, female, viking, warrior, within, recent, years, however, the, conclusions, remain, contentious, vikings, have, served, as, an, inspiration, for, numerous, video, games, such, as, the, lost, vikings, 1993, age, of, mythology, 2002, and, for, honor, 2017, all, three, vikings, from, the, lost, vikings, series, erik, the, swift,

alternative, history, of, the, viking, invasion, of, britain, modern, reconstructions, of, viking, mythology, have, shown, a, persistent, influence, in, late, 20th, and, early, 21st, century, popular, culture, in, some, countries, inspiring, comics, movies, television, series, role, playing, games, computer, games, and, music, including, viking, metal, a, subgenre, of, heavy, metal, music, since, the, 1960s, there, has, been, rising, enthusiasm, for, historical, reenactment, while, the, earliest, groups, had, little, claim, for, historical, accuracy, the, seriousness, and, accuracy, of, reenactors, has, increased, the, largest, such, groups, include, the, vikings, and, regia, anglorum, though, many, smaller, groups, exist, in, europe, north, america, new, zealand, and, australia, many, reenactor, groups, participate, in, live, steel, combat, and, a, few, have, viking, style, ships, or, boats, the, minnesota, vikings, of, the, national, football, league, are, so, named, owing, to, the, large, scandinavian, population, in, the, us, state, of, minnesota, during, the, banking, boom, of, the, first, decade, of, the, twenty, first, century, icelandic, financiers, came, to, be, styled, as, tr, sarv, kingar, roughly, raiding, vikings, experimental, archaeology, of, the, viking, age, is, a, flourishing, branch, and, several, places, have, been, dedicated, to, this, technique, such, as, jorvik, viking, centre, in, the, united, kingdom, sagnlandet, lejre, and, ribe, viking, center, in, denmark, foteviken, museum, in, sweden, or, lofotr, viking, museum, in, norway, viking, age, reenactors, have, undertaken, experimental, activities, such, as, iron, smelting, and, forging, using, norse, techniques, at, norstead, in, newfoundland, for, example, on, 1, july, 2007, the, reconstructed, viking, ship, skuldelev, 2, renamed, sea, stallion, began, a, journey, from, roskilde, to, dublin, the, remains, of, that, ship, and, four, others, were, discovered, during, a, 1962, excavation, in, the, roskilde, fjord, tree, ring, analysis, has, shown, the, ship, was, built, of, oak, in, the, vicinity, of, dublin, in, about, 1042, seventy, multinational, crew, members, sailed, the, ship, back, to, its, home, and, sea, stallion, arrived, outside, dublin, s, custom, house, on, 14, august, 2007, the, purpose, of, the, voyage, was, to, test, and, document, the, seaworthiness, speed, and, manoeuvrability, of, the, ship, on, the, rough, open, sea, and, in, coastal, waters, with, treacherous, currents, the, crew, tested, how, the, long, narrow, flexible, hull, withstood, the, tough, ocean, waves, the, expedition, also, provided, valuable, new, information, on, viking, longships, and, society, the, ship, was, built, using, viking, tools, materials, and, much, of, the, same, methods, as, the, original, ship, other, vessels, often, replicas, of, the, gokstad, ship, full, or, half, scale, or, skuldelev, have, been, built, and, tested, as, well, the, snorri, a, skuldelev, i, knarr, was, sailed, from, greenland, to, newfoundland, in, 1998, apart, from, two, or, three, representations, of, ritual, helmets, with, protrusions, that, may, be, either, stylised, ravens, snakes, or, horns, no, depiction, of, the, helmets, of, viking, warriors, and, no, preserved, helmet, has, horns, the, formal, close, quarters, style, of, viking, combat, either, in, shield, walls, or, aboard, ship, islands, would, have, made, horned, helmets, cumbersome, and, hazardous, to, the, warrior, s, own, side, historians, therefore, believe, that, viking, warriors, did, not, wear, horned, helmets, whether, such, helmets, were, used, in, scandinavian, culture, for, other, ritual, purposes, remains, unproven, the, general, misconception, that, viking, warriors, wore, horned, helmets, was, partly, promulgated, by, the, 19th, century, enthusiasts, of, g, tiska, f, rbundet, founded, in, 1811, in, stockholm, they, promoted, the, use, of, norse, mythology, as, the, subject, of, high, art, and, other, ethnological, and, moral, aims, the, vikings, were, often, depicted, with, winged, helmets, and, in, other, clothing, taken, from, classical, antiquity, especially, in, depictions, of, norse, gods, this, was, done, to, legitimise, the, vikings, and, their, mythology, by, associating, it, with, the, classical, world, which, had, long, been, idealised, in, european, culture, the, latter, day, mythos, created, by, national, romantic, ideas, blended, the, viking, age, with, aspects, of, the, nordic, bronze, age, some, 2, 000, years, earlier, horned, helmets, from, the, bronze, age, were, shown, in, petroglyphs, and, appeared, in, archaeological, finds, see, bohusl, n, and, vikso, helmets, they, were, probably, used, for, ceremonial, purposes, cartoons, like, h, gar, the, horrible, and, vicky, the, viking, and, sports, kits, such, as, those, of, the, minnesota, vikings, and, canberra, raiders, have, perpetuated, the, myth, of, the, horned, helmet, viking, helmets, were, conical, made, from, hard, leather, with, wood, and, metallic, reinforcements, for, regular, troops, the, iron, helmet, with, mask, and, mail, was, for, the, chieftains, based, on, the, previous, vendel, age, helmets, from, central, sweden, the, only, original, viking, helmet, discovered, is, the, gjermundbu, helmet, found, in, norway, this, helmet, is, made, of, iron, and, has, been, dated, to, the, 10th, century, the, image, of, wild, haired, dirty, savages, sometimes, associated, with, the, vikings, in, popular, culture, is, a, distorted, picture, of, reality, viking, tendencies, were, often, misreported, and, the, work, of, adam, of, bremen, among, others, told, largely, disputable, tales, of, viking, savagery, and, uncleanliness, there, is, no, evidence, that, vikings, drank, out, of, the, skulls, of, vanquished, enemies, this, was, a, misconception, based, on, a, passage, in, the, skaldic, poem, kr, kum, l, speaking, of, heroes, drinking, from, r, bj, gvi, um, hausa, branches, of, skulls, this, was, a, reference, to, drinking, horns, but, was, mistranslated, in, the, 17th, century, as, referring, to, the, skulls, of, the, slain, margaryan, et, al, 2020, analysed, 442, viking, world, individuals, from, various, archaeological, sites, in, europe, they, were, found, to, be, closely, related, to, modern, scandinavians, the, y, dna, composition, of, the, individuals, in, the, study, was, also, similar, to, that, of, modern, scandinavians, the, most, common, y, dna, haplogroup, was, i1, 95, samples, followed, by, r1b, 84, samples, and, r1a, especially, but, not, exclusively, of, the, scandinavian, r1a, z284, subclade, 61, samples, the, study, showed, what, many, historians, have, hypothesised, that, it, was, common, for, norseman, settlers, to, marry, foreign, women, some, individuals, from, the, study, such, as, those, found, in, foggia, displayed, typical, scandinavian, y, dna, haplogroups, but, also, southern, european, autosomal, ancestry, suggesting, that, they, were, the, descendants, of, viking, settler, males, and, local, women, the, five, individual, samples, from, foggia, were, likely, normans, the, same, pattern, of, a, combination, of, scandinavian, y, dna, and, local, autosomal, ancestry, is, seen, in, other, samples, from, the, study, for, example, varangians, buried, near, lake, ladoga, and, vikings, in, england, suggesting, that, viking, men, had, married, into, local, families, in, those, places, too, the, study, found, evidence, of, a, swedish, influx, into, estonia, and, finland, and, norwegian, influx, into, ireland, iceland, and, greenland, during, the, viking, age, however, the, authors, commented, viking, age, danish, like, ancestry, in, the, british, isles, cannot, be, distinguished, from, that, of, the, angles, and, saxons, who, migrated, in, the, fifth, to, sixth, centuries, ad, from, jutland, and, northern, germany, margaryan, et, al, 2020, examined, the, skeletal, remains, of, 42, individuals, from, the, salme, ship, burials, in, estonia, the, skeletal, remains, belonged, to, warriors, killed, in, battle, who, were, later, buried, together, with, numerous, valuable, weapons, and, armour, dna, testing, and, isotope, analysis, revealed, that, the, men, came, from, central, sweden, female, descent, studies, show, evidence, of, norse, descent, in, areas, closest, to, scandinavia, such, as, the, shetland, and, orkney, islands, inhabitants, of, lands, farther, away, show, most, norse, descent, in, the, male, y, chromosome, lines, a, specialised, genetic, and, surname, study, in, liverpool, showed, marked, norse, heritage, up, to, 50, of, males, of, families, that, lived, there, before, the, years, of, industrialisation, and, population, expansion, high, percentages, of, norse, inheritance, tracked, through, the, r, m420, haplotype, were, also, found, among, males, in, the, wirral, and, west, lancashire, this, was, similar, to, the, percentage, of, norse, inheritance, found, among, males, in, the, orkney, islands, recent, research, suggests, that, the, celtic, warrior, somerled, who, drove, the, vikings, out, of, western, scotland, and, was, the, progenitor, of, clan, donald, may, have, been, of, viking, descent, a, member, of, haplogroup, r, m420, margaryan, et, al, 2020, examined, an, elite, warrior, burial, from, bodzia, poland, dated, to, 1010, 1020, ad, the, cemetery, in, bodzia, is, exceptional, in, terms, of, scandinavian, and, kievian, rus, links, the, bodzia, man, sample, vk157, or, burial, e864, i, was, not, a, simple, warrior, from, the, princely, retinue, but, he, belonged, to, the, princely, family, himself, his, burial, is, the, richest, one, in, the, whole, cemetery, moreover, strontium, analysis, of, his, teeth, enamel, shows, he, was, not, local, it, is, assumed, that, he, came, to, poland, with, the, prince, of, kiev, sviatopolk, the, accursed, and, met, a, violent, death, in, combat, this, corresponds, to, the, events, of, 1018, ad, when, sviatopolk, himself, disappeared, after, having, retreated, from, kiev, to, poland, it, cannot, be, excluded, that, the, bodzia, man, was, sviatopolk, himself, as, the, genealogy, of, the, rurikids, at, this, period, is, extremely, sketchy, and, the, dates, of, birth, of, many, princes, of, this, dynasty, may, be, quite, approximative, the, bodzia,
