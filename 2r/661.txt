the, history, of, medicine, is, both, a, study, of, medicine, throughout, history, as, well, as, a, multidisciplinary, field, of, study, that, seeks, to, explore, and, understand, medical, practices, both, past, and, present, throughout, human, societies, the, history, of, medicine, is, the, study, and, documentation, of, the, evolution, of, medical, treatments, practices, and, knowledge, over, time, medical, historians, often, draw, from, other, humanities, fields, of, study, including, economics, health, sciences, sociology, and, politics, to, better, understand, the, institutions, practices, people, professions, and, social, systems, that, have, shaped, medicine, when, a, period, which, predates, or, lacks, written, sources, regarding, medicine, information, is, instead, drawn, from, archaeological, sources, this, field, tracks, the, evolution, of, human, societies, approach, to, health, illness, and, injury, ranging, from, prehistory, to, the, modern, day, the, events, that, shape, these, approaches, and, their, impact, on, populations, early, medical, traditions, include, those, of, babylon, china, egypt, and, india, invention, of, the, microscope, was, a, consequence, of, improved, understanding, during, the, renaissance, prior, to, the, 19th, century, humorism, also, known, as, humoralism, was, thought, to, explain, the, cause, of, disease, but, it, was, gradually, replaced, by, the, germ, theory, of, disease, leading, to, effective, treatments, and, even, cures, for, many, infectious, diseases, military, doctors, advanced, the, methods, of, trauma, treatment, and, surgery, public, health, measures, were, developed, especially, in, the, 19th, century, as, the, rapid, growth, of, cities, required, systematic, sanitary, measures, advanced, research, centers, opened, in, the, early, 20th, century, often, connected, with, major, hospitals, the, mid, 20th, century, was, characterized, by, new, biological, treatments, such, as, antibiotics, these, advancements, along, with, developments, in, chemistry, genetics, and, radiography, led, to, modern, medicine, medicine, was, heavily, professionalized, in, the, 20th, century, and, new, careers, opened, to, women, as, nurses, from, the, 1870s, and, as, physicians, especially, after, 1970, prehistoric, medicine, is, a, field, of, study, focused, on, understanding, the, use, of, medicinal, plants, healing, practices, illnesses, and, wellness, of, humans, before, written, records, existed, although, styled, prehistoric, medicine, prehistoric, healthcare, practices, were, vastly, different, from, what, we, understand, medicine, to, be, in, the, present, era, and, more, accurately, refers, to, studies, and, exploration, of, early, healing, practices, this, period, extends, across, the, first, use, of, stone, tools, by, early, humans, c, 3, 3, million, years, ago, to, the, beginning, of, writing, systems, and, subsequent, recorded, history, c, 5000, years, ago, as, human, populations, were, once, scattered, across, the, world, forming, isolated, communities, and, cultures, that, sporadically, interacted, a, range, of, archaeological, periods, have, been, developed, to, account, for, the, differing, contexts, of, technology, sociocultural, developments, and, uptake, of, writing, systems, throughout, early, human, societies, prehistoric, medicine, is, then, highly, contextual, to, the, location, and, people, in, question, creating, an, ununiform, period, of, study, to, reflect, various, degrees, of, societal, development, without, written, records, insights, into, prehistoric, medicine, comes, indirectly, from, interpreting, evidence, left, behind, by, prehistoric, humans, one, branch, of, this, includes, the, archaeology, of, medicine, a, discipline, that, uses, a, range, of, archaeological, techniques, from, observing, illness, in, human, remains, plant, fossils, to, excavations, to, uncover, medical, practices, there, is, evidence, of, healing, practices, within, neanderthals, and, other, early, human, species, prehistoric, evidence, of, human, engagement, with, medicine, include, the, discovery, of, psychoactive, plant, sources, such, as, psilocybin, mushrooms, in, c, 6000, bce, sahara, to, primitive, dental, care, in, c, 10, 900, bce, 13, 000, bp, riparo, fredian, present, day, italy, and, c, 7000, bce, mehrgarh, present, day, pakistan, anthropology, is, another, academic, branch, that, contributes, to, understanding, prehistoric, medicine, in, uncovering, the, sociocultural, relationships, meaning, and, interpretation, of, prehistoric, evidence, the, overlap, of, medicine, as, both, a, root, to, healing, the, body, as, well, as, the, spiritual, throughout, prehistoric, periods, highlights, the, multiple, purposes, that, healing, practices, and, plants, could, potentially, have, from, proto, religions, to, developed, spiritual, systems, relationships, of, humans, and, supernatural, entities, from, gods, to, shamans, have, played, an, interwoven, part, in, prehistoric, medicine, ancient, history, covers, time, between, c, 3000, bce, to, c, 500, ce, starting, from, evidenced, development, of, writing, systems, to, the, end, of, the, classical, era, and, beginning, of, the, post, classical, period, this, periodisation, presents, history, as, if, it, were, the, same, everywhere, however, it, is, important, to, note, that, socioculture, and, technological, developments, could, differ, locally, from, settlement, to, settlement, as, well, as, globally, from, one, society, to, the, next, ancient, medicine, covers, a, similar, period, of, time, and, presented, a, range, of, similar, healing, theories, from, across, the, world, connecting, nature, religion, and, humans, within, ideas, of, circulating, fluids, and, energy, although, prominent, scholars, and, texts, detailed, well, defined, medical, insights, their, real, world, applications, were, marred, by, knowledge, destruction, and, loss, poor, communication, localised, reinterpretations, and, subsequent, inconsistent, applications, the, mesopotamian, region, covering, much, of, present, day, iraq, kuwait, syria, iran, and, turkey, was, dominated, by, a, series, of, civilisations, including, sumer, the, earliest, known, civilisation, in, the, fertile, crescent, region, alongside, the, akkadians, including, assyrians, and, babylonians, overlapping, ideas, of, what, we, now, understand, as, medicine, science, magic, and, religion, characterised, early, mesopotamian, healing, practices, as, a, hybrid, naturalistic, and, supernatural, belief, system, the, sumerians, having, developed, one, of, the, earliest, known, writing, systems, in, the, 3rd, millennium, bce, created, numerous, cuneiform, clay, tablets, regarding, their, civilisation, included, detailed, accounts, of, drug, prescriptions, operations, to, exorcisms, these, were, administered, and, carried, out, by, highly, defined, professionals, including, b, r, seers, s, ipu, exorcists, and, as, physician, priests, an, example, of, an, early, prescription, like, medication, appeared, in, sumerian, during, the, third, dynasty, of, ur, c, 2112, bce, c, 2004, bce, following, the, conquest, of, the, sumerian, civilisation, by, the, akkadian, empire, and, the, empire, s, eventual, collapse, from, a, number, of, social, and, environmental, factors, the, babylonian, civilisation, began, to, dominate, the, region, examples, of, babylonian, medicine, include, the, extensive, babylonian, medical, text, the, diagnostic, handbook, written,

often, detailed, empirical, observations, along, with, logical, rules, used, in, combining, observed, symptoms, on, the, body, of, a, patient, with, its, diagnosis, and, prognosis, 97, 98, here, clearly, developed, rationales, were, developed, to, understand, the, causes, of, disease, and, injury, supported, by, agreed, upon, theories, at, the, time, of, elements, we, might, now, understand,

remains, poorly, researched, and, supported, and, most, of, its, treatments, have, no, logical, mechanism, of, action, it, also, described, tcm, as, fraught, with, pseudoscience, a, review, of, the, literature, in, 2008, found, that, scientists, are, still, unable, to, find, a, shred, of, evidence, according, to, standards, of, science, based, medicine, for, traditional, chinese, concepts, such, as, qi, meridians, and, acupuncture, points, and, that, the, traditional, principles, of, acupuncture, are, deeply, flawed, there, are, concerns, over, a, number, of, potentially, toxic, plants,

medical, knowledge, during, the, vedic, period, the, use, of, herbs, to, treat, ailments, would, later, form, a, large, part, of, ayurveda, ayurveda, meaning, the, complete, knowledge, for, long, life, is, another, medical, system, of, india, its, two, most, famous, texts, samhitas, belong, to, the, schools, of, charaka, and, sushruta, the, samhitas, represent, later, revised, versions, recensions, of, their, original, works, the, earliest, foundations, of, ayurveda, were, built, on, a, synthesis, of, traditional, herbal, practices, together, with, a, massive, addition, of, theoretical, conceptualizations, new, nosologies, and, new, therapies, dating, from, about, 600, bce, onwards, and, coming, out, of, the, communities, of, thinkers, which, included, the, buddha, and, others, according, to, the, compendium, of, charaka, the, charakasamhit, health, and, disease, are, not, predetermined, and, life, may, be, prolonged, by, human, effort, the, compendium, of, su, ruta,

the, examination, diagnosis, treatment, and, prognosis, of, numerous, ailments, the, su, rutasamhit, is, notable, for, describing, procedures, on, various, forms, of, surgery, including, rhinoplasty, the, repair, of, torn, ear, lobes, perineal, lithotomy, cataract, surgery, and, several, other, excisions, and, other, surgical, procedures, most, remarkable, was, susruta, s, surgery, specially, the, rhinoplasty, for, which, he, is, called, father, of, plastic, surgery, susruta, also, described, more, than, 125, surgical, instruments, in, detail, also, remarkable, is, sushruta, s, penchant, for, scientific, classification, his, medical, treatise, consists, of, 184, chapters, 1, 120, conditions, are, listed, including, injuries, and, illnesses, relating, to, aging, and, mental, illness, the, ayurvedic, classics, mention, eight, branches, of, medicine, k, y, cikits, internal, medicine, alyacikits, surgery, including, anatomy, l, kyacikits, eye, ear, nose, and, throat, diseases, kaum, rabh,

preparation, and, application, of, his, medicines, distillation, operative, skills, cooking, horticulture, metallurgy, sugar, manufacture, pharmacy, analysis, and, separation, of, minerals, compounding, of, metals, and, preparation, of, alkalis, the, teaching, of, various, subjects, was, done, during, the, instruction, of, relevant, clinical, subjects, for, example, the, teaching, of, anatomy, was, a, part, of, the, teaching, of, surgery, embryology, was, a, part, of, training, in, pediatrics, and, obstetrics, and, the, knowledge, of, physiology, and, pathology, was, interwoven, in, the, teaching, of, all, the, clinical, disciplines, even, today, ayurvedic, treatment, is, practiced, but, it, is, considered, pseudoscientific, because, its, premises, are, not, based, on, science, some, ayurvedic, medicines, have, been, found, to, contain, toxic, substances, both, the, lack, of, scientific, soundness, in, the, theoretical, foundations, of, ayurveda, and, the, quality, of, research, have, been, criticized, humors, the, theory, of, humors, was, derived, from, ancient, medical, works, dominated, western, medicine, until, the, 19th, century, and, is, credited, to, greek, philosopher, and, surgeon, galen, of, pergamon, 129, c, 216, ce, in, greek, medicine, there, are, thought, to, be, four, humors, or, bodily, fluids, that, are, linked, to, illness, blood, phlegm, yellow, bile, and, black, bile, early, scientists, believed, that, food, is, digested, into, blood, muscle, and, bones, while, the, humors, that, were, not, blood, were, then, formed, by, indigestible, materials, that, are, left, over, an, excess, or, shortage, of, any, one, of, the, four, humors, is, theorized, to, cause, an, imbalance, that, results, in, sickness, the, aforementioned, statement, was, hypothesized, by, sources, before, hippocrates, hippocrates, c, 400, bce, deduced, that, the, four, seasons, of, the, year, and, four, ages, of, man, that, affect, the, body, in, relation, to, the, humors, the, four, ages, of, man, are, childhood, youth, prime, age, and, old, age, the, four, humors, as, associated, with, the, four, seasons, are, black, bile, autumn, yellow, bile, summer, phlegm, winter, and, blood, spring, in, de, temperamentis, galen, linked, what, he, called, temperaments, or, personality, characteristics, to, a, person, s, natural, mixture, of, humors, he, also, said, that, the, best, place, to, check, the, balance, of, temperaments, was, in, the, palm, of, the, hand, a, person, that, is, considered, to, be, phlegmatic, is, said, to, be, an, introvert, even, tempered, calm, and, peaceful, this, person, would, have, an, excess, of, phlegm, which, is, described, as, a, viscous, substance, or, mucous, similarly, a, melancholic, temperament, related, to, being, moody, anxious, depressed, introverted, and, pessimistic, a, melancholic, temperament, is, caused, by, an, excess, of, black, bile, which, is, sedimentary, and, dark, in, colour, being, extroverted, talkative, easygoing, carefree, and, sociable, coincides, with, a, sanguine, temperament, which, is, linked, to, too, much, blood, finally, a, choleric, temperament, is, related, to, too, much, yellow, bile, which, is, actually, red, in, colour, and, has, the, texture, of, foam, it, is, associated, with, being, aggressive, excitable, impulsive, and, also, extroverted, there, are, numerous, ways, to, treat, a, disproportion, of, the, humors, for, example, if, someone, was, suspected, to, have, too, much, blood, then, the, physician, would, perform, bloodletting, as, a, treatment, likewise, if, a, person, believed, to, have, too, much, phlegm, should, feel, better, after, expectorating, and, someone, with, too, much, yellow, bile, would, purge, another, factor, to, be, considered, in, the, balance, of, humors, is, the, quality, of, air, where, one, resides, such, as, the, climate, and, elevation, also, the, standard, of, food, and, drink, balance, of, sleeping, and, waking, exercise, and, rest, retention, and, evacuation, are, important, moods, such, as, anger, sadness, joy, and, love, can, affect, the, balance, during, that, time, the, importance, of, balance, was, demonstrated, by, the, fact, that, women, lose, blood, monthly, during, menstruation, and, have, a, lesser, occurrence, of, gout, arthritis, and, epilepsy, then, men, do, galen, also, hypothesized, that, there, are, three, faculties, the, natural, faculty, affects, growth, and, reproduction, and, is, produced, in, the, liver, animal, or, vital, faculty, controls, respiration, and, emotion, coming, from, the, heart, in, the, brain, the, psychic, faculty, commands, the, senses, and, thoughts, the, structure, of, bodily, functions, is, related, to, the, humors, as, well, greek, physicians, understood, that, food, was, cooked, in, the, stomach, this, is, where, the, nutrients, are, extracted, the, best, most, potent, and, pure, nutrients, from, food, are, reserved, for, blood, which, is, produced, in, the, liver, and, carried, through, veins, to, organs, blood, enhanced, with, pneuma, which, means, wind, or, breath, is, carried, by, the, arteries, the, path, that, blood, take, is, as, follows, venous, blood, passes, through, the, vena, cava, and, is, moved, into, the, right, ventricle, of, the, heart, then, the, pulmonary, artery, takes, it, to, the, lungs, later, the, pulmonary, vein, then, mixes, air, from, the, lungs, with, blood, to, form, arterial, blood, which, has, different, observable, characteristics, after, leaving, the, liver, half, of, the, yellow, bile, that, is, produced, travels, to, the, blood, while, the, other, half, travels, to, the, gallbladder, similarly, half, of, the, black, bile, produced, gets, mixed, in, with, blood, and, the, other, half, is, used, by, the, spleen, people, around, 800, bce, homer, in, the, iliad, gives, descriptions, of, wound, treatment, by, the, two, sons, of, asklepios, the, admirable, physicians, podaleirius, and, machaon, and, one, acting, doctor, patroclus, because, machaon, is, wounded, and, podaleirius, is, in, combat, eurypylus, asks, patroclus, to, cut, out, the, arrow, head, and, wash, the, dark, blood, from, my, thigh, with, warm, water, and, sprinkle, soothing, herbs, with, power, to, heal, on, my, wound, asklepios, like, imhotep, came, to, be, associated, as, a, god, of, healing, over, time, temples, dedicated, to, the, healer, god, asclepius, known, as, asclepieia, ancient, greek, sing, asclepieion, functioned, as, centers, of, medical, advice, prognosis, and, healing, at, these, shrines, patients, would, enter, a, dream, like, state, of, induced, sleep, known, as, enkoimesis, not, unlike, anesthesia, in, which, they, either, received, guidance, from, the, deity, in, a, dream, or, were, cured, by, surgery, asclepeia, provided, carefully, controlled, spaces, conducive, to, healing, and, fulfilled, several, of, the, requirements, of, institutions, created, for, healing, in, the, asclepeion, of, epidaurus, three, large, marble, boards, dated, to, 350, bce, preserve, the, names, case, histories, complaints, and, cures, of, about, 70, patients, who, came, to, the, temple, with, a, problem, and, shed, it, there, some, of, the, surgical, cures, listed, such, as, the, opening, of, an, abdominal, abscess, or, the, removal, of, traumatic, foreign, material, are, realistic, enough, to, have, taken, place, but, with, the, patient, in, a, state, of, enkoimesis, induced, with, the, help, of, soporific, substances, such, as, opium, alcmaeon, of, croton, wrote, on, medicine, between, 500, and, 450, bce, he, argued, that, channels, linked, the, sensory, organs, to, the, brain, and, it, is, possible, that, he, discovered, one, type, of, channel, the, optic, nerves, by, dissection, hippocrates, of, kos, c, 460, c, 370, bce, considered, the, father, of, modern, medicine, the, hippocratic, corpus, is, a, collection, of, around, seventy, early, medical, works, from, ancient, greece, strongly, associated, with, hippocrates, and, his, students, most, famously, the, hippocratics, invented, the, hippocratic, oath, for, physicians, contemporary, physicians, swear, an, oath, of, office, which, includes, aspects, found, in, early, editions, of, the, hippocratic, oath, hippocrates, and, his, followers, were, first, to, describe, many, diseases, and, medical, conditions, though, humorism, humoralism, as, a, medical, system, predates, 5th, century, greek, medicine, hippocrates, and, his, students, systematized, the, thinking, that, illness, can, be, explained, by, an, imbalance, of, blood, phlegm, black, bile, and, yellow, bile, hippocrates, is, given, credit, for, the, first, description, of, clubbing, of, the, fingers, an, important, diagnostic, sign, in, chronic, suppurative, lung, disease, lung, cancer, and, cyanotic, heart, disease, for, this, reason, clubbed, fingers, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, hippocratic, fingers, hippocrates, was, also, the, first, physician, to, describe, the, hippocratic, face, in, prognosis, shakespeare, famously, alludes, to, this, description, when, writing, of, falstaff, s, death, in, act, ii, scene, iii, of, henry, v, hippocrates, began, to, categorize, illnesses, as, acute, chronic, endemic, and, epidemic, and, use, terms, such, as, exacerbation, relapse, resolution, crisis, paroxysm, peak, and, convalescence, the, greek, galen, c, 129, 216, ce, was, one, of, the, greatest, physicians, of, the, ancient, world, as, his, theories, dominated, all, medical, studies, for, nearly, 1500, years, his, theories, and, experimentation, laid, the, foundation, for, modern, medicine, surrounding, the, heart, and, blood, galen, s, influence, and, innovations, in, medicine, can, be, attributed, to, the, experiments, he, conducted, which, were, unlike, any, other, medical, experiments, of, his, time, galen, strongly, believed, that, medical, dissection, was, one, of, the, essential, procedures, in, truly, understanding, medicine, he, began, to, dissect, different, animals, that, were, anatomically, similar, to, humans, which, allowed, him, to, learn, more, about, the, internal, organs, and, extrapolate, the, surgical, studies, to, the, human, body, in, addition, he, performed, many, audacious, operations, including, brain, and, eye, surgeries, that, were, not, tried, again, for, almost, two, millennia, through, the, dissections, and, surgical, procedures, galen, concluded, that, blood, is, able, to, circulate, throughout, the, human, body, and, the, heart, is, most, similar, to, the, human, soul, in, ars, medica, arts, of, medicine, he, further, explains, the, mental, properties, in, terms, of, specific, mixtures, of, the, bodily, organs, while, much, of, his, work, surrounded, the, physical, anatomy, he, also, worked, heavily, in, humoral, physiology, galen, s, medical, work, was, regarded, as, authoritative, until, well, into, the, middle, ages, he, left, a, physiological, model, of, the, human, body, that, became, the, mainstay, of, the, medieval, physician, s, university, anatomy, curriculum, although, he, attempted, to, extrapolate, the, animal, dissections, towards, the, model, of, the, human, body, some, of, galen, s, theories, were, incorrect, this, caused, his, model, to, suffer, greatly, from, stasis, and, intellectual, stagnation, greek, and, roman, taboos, caused, dissection, of, the, human, body, to, usually, be, banned, in, ancient, times, but, in, the, middle, ages, it, changed, in, 1523, galen, s, on, the, natural, faculties, was, published, in, london, in, the, 1530s, belgian, anatomist, and, physician, andreas, vesalius, launched, a, project, to, translate, many, of, galen, s, greek, texts, into, latin, vesalius, s, most, famous, work, de, humani, corporis, fabrica, was, greatly, influenced, by, galenic, writing, and, form, herophilus, and, erasistratus, two, great, alexandrians, laid, the, foundations, for, the, scientific, study, of, anatomy, and, physiology, herophilus, of, chalcedon, and, erasistratus, of, ceos, other, alexandrian, surgeons, gave, us, ligature, hemostasis, lithotomy, hernia, operations, ophthalmic, surgery, plastic, surgery, methods, of, reduction, of, dislocations, and, fractures, tracheotomy, and, mandrake, as, an, anaesthetic, some, of, what, we, know, of, them, comes, from, celsus, and, galen, of, pergamum, herophilus, of, chalcedon, the, renowned, alexandrian, physician, was, one, of, the, pioneers, of, human, anatomy, though, his, knowledge, of, the, anatomical, structure, of, the, human, body, was, vast, he, specialized, in, the, aspects, of, neural, anatomy, thus, his, experimentation, was, centered, around, the, anatomical, composition, of, the, blood, vascular, system, and, the, pulsations, that, can, be, analyzed, from, the, system, furthermore, the, surgical, experimentation, he, administered, caused, him, to, become, very, prominent, throughout, the, field, of, medicine, as, he, was, one, of, the, first, physicians, to, initiate, the, exploration, and, dissection, of, the, human, body, the, banned, practice, of, human, dissection, was, lifted, during, his, time, within, the, scholastic, community, this, brief, moment, in, the, history, of, greek, medicine, allowed, him, to, further, study, the, brain, which, he, believed, was, the, core, of, the, nervous, system, he, also, distinguished, between, veins, and, arteries, noting, that, the, latter, pulse, and, the, former, do, not, thus, while, working, at, the, medical, school, of, alexandria, herophilus, placed, intelligence, in, the, brain, based, on, his, surgical, exploration, of, the, body, and, he, connected, the, nervous, system, to, motion, and, sensation, in, addition, he, and, his, contemporary, erasistratus, of, chios, continued, to, research, the, role, of, veins, and, nerves, after, conducting, extensive, research, the, two, alexandrians, mapped, out, the, course, of, the, veins, and, nerves, across, the, human, body, erasistratus, connected, the, increased, complexity, of, the, surface, of, the, human, brain, compared, to, other, animals, to, its, superior, intelligence, he, sometimes, employed, experiments, to, further, his, research, at, one, time, repeatedly, weighing, a, caged, bird, and, noting, its, weight, loss, between, feeding, times, in, erasistratus, physiology, air, enters, the, body, is, then, drawn, by, the, lungs, into, the, heart, where, it, is, transformed, into, vital, spirit, and, is, then, pumped, by, the, arteries, throughout, the, body, some, of, this, vital, spirit, reaches, the, brain, where, it, is, transformed, into, animal, spirit, which, is, then, distributed, by, the, nerves, the, romans, invented, numerous, surgical, instruments, including, the, first, instruments, unique, to, women, as, well, as, the, surgical, uses, of, forceps, scalpels, cautery, cross, bladed, scissors, the, surgical, needle, the, sound, and, speculas, romans, also, performed, cataract, surgery, the, roman, army, physician, dioscorides, c, 40, 90, ce, was, a, greek, botanist, and, pharmacologist, he, wrote, the, encyclopedia, de, materia, medica, describing, over, 600, herbal, cures, forming, an, influential, pharmacopoeia, which, was, used, extensively, for, the, following, 1, 500, years, early, christians, in, the, roman, empire, incorporated, medicine, into, their, theology, ritual, practices, and, metaphors, byzantine, medicine, byzantine, medicine, encompasses, the, common, medical, practices, of, the, byzantine, empire, from, about, 400, ce, to, 1453, ce, byzantine, medicine, was, notable, for, building, upon, the, knowledge, base, developed, by, its, greco, roman, predecessors, in, preserving, medical, practices, from, antiquity, byzantine, medicine, influenced, islamic, medicine, as, well, as, fostering, the, western, rebirth, of, medicine, during, the, renaissance, byzantine, physicians, often, compiled, and, standardized, medical, knowledge, into, textbooks, their, records, tended, to, include, both, diagnostic, explanations, and, technical, drawings, the, medical, compendium, in, seven, books, written, by, the, leading, physician, paul, of, aegina, survived, as, a, particularly, thorough, source, of, medical, knowledge, this, compendium, written, in, the, late, seventh, century, remained, in, use, as, a, standard, textbook, for, the, following, 800, years, late, antiquity, ushered, in, a, revolution, in, medical, science, and, historical, records, often, mention, civilian, hospitals, although, battlefield, medicine, and, wartime, triage, were, recorded, well, before, imperial, rome, constantinople, stood, out, as, a, center, of, medicine, during, the, middle, ages, which, was, aided, by, its, crossroads, location, wealth, and, accumulated, knowledge, the, first, ever, known, example, of, separating, conjoined, twins, occurred, in, the, byzantine, empire, in, the, 10th, century, the, next, example, of, separating, conjoined, twins, would, be, recorded, many, centuries, later, in, germany, in, 1689, the, byzantine, empire, s, neighbors, the, persian, sassanid, empire, also, made, their, noteworthy, contributions, mainly, with, the, establishment, of, the, academy, of, gondeshapur, which, was, the, most, important, medical, center, of, the, ancient, world, during, the, 6th, and, 7th, centuries, in, addition, cyril, elgood, british, physician, and, a, historian, of, medicine, in, persia, commented, that, thanks, to, medical, centers, like, the, academy, of, gondeshapur, to, a, very, large, extent, the, credit, for, the, whole, hospital, system, must, be, given, to, persia, islamic, medicine, the, islamic, civilization, rose, to, primacy, in, medical, science, as, its, physicians, contributed, significantly, to, the, field, of, medicine, including, anatomy, ophthalmology, pharmacology, pharmacy, physiology, and, surgery, islamic, civilization, s, contribution, to, these, fields, within, medicine, was, a, gradual, process, that, took, hundreds, of, years, during, the, time, of, the, first, great, muslim, dynasty, the, umayyad, caliphate, 661, 750, ce, these, fields, that, were, in, their, very, early, stages, of, development, and, not, much, progress, was, made, one, reason, for, the, limited, advancement, in, medicine, during, the, umayyad, caliphate, was, the, caliphate, s, focus, on, expansion, after, the, death, of, muhammad, 632, ce, the, focus, on, expansionism, redirected, resources, from, other, fields, such, as, medicine, the, priority, on, these, factors, led, a, large, percentage, of, the, population, to, believe, that, god, will, provide, cures, for, their, illnesses, and, diseases, because, of, the, attention, on, spirituality, there, were, also, many, other, areas, of, interest, during, that, time, before, there, was, a, rising, interest, in, the, field, of, medicine, abd, al, malik, ibn, marwan, the, fifth, caliph, of, the, umayyad, developed, governmental, administration, adopted, arabic, as, the, main, language, and, focused, on, many, other, areas, however, this, rising, interest, in, islamic, medicine, grew, significantly, when, the, abbasid, caliphate, 750, 1258, ce, overthrew, the, umayyad, caliphate, in, 750, ce, this, change, in, dynasty, from, the, umayyad, caliphate, to, the, abbasid, caliphate, served, as, a, turning, point, towards, scientific, and, medical, developments, a, large, contributor, to, this, was, that, under, abbasid, rule, there, much, of, the, greek, legacy, was, transmitted, into, arabic, which, by, then, was, the, main, language, of, islamic, nations, because, of, this, many, islamic, physicians, were, heavily, influenced, by, the, works, of, greek, scholars, of, alexandria, and, egypt, and, were, able, to, further, expand, on, those, texts, to, produce, new, medical, pieces, of, knowledge, this, period, of, time, is, also, known, as, the, islamic, golden, age, where, there, was, a, period, of, development, for, development, and, flourishments, of, technology, commerce, and, sciences, including, medicine, additionally, during, this, time, the, creation, of, the, first, islamic, hospital, in, 805, ce, by, the, abbasid, caliph, harun, al, rashid, in, baghdad, was, recounted, as, a, glorious, event, of, the, golden, age, this, hospital, in, baghdad, contributed, immensely, to, baghdad, s, success, and, also, provided, educational, opportunities, for, islamic, physicians, during, the, islamic, golden, age, there, were, many, famous, islamic, physicians, that, paved, the, way, for, medical, advancements, and, understandings, however, this, would, not, be, possible, without, the, influence, from, many, different, areas, of, the, world, that, influenced, the, arabs, the, arabs, were, influenced, by, ancient, indian, persian, greek, roman, and, byzantine, medical, practices, and, helped, them, develop, further, galen, hippocrates, were, pre, eminent, authorities, the, translation, of, 129, of, galen, s, works, into, arabic, by, the, nestorian, christian, hunayn, ibn, ishaq, and, his, assistants, and, in, particular, galen, s, insistence, on, a, rational, systematic, approach, to, medicine, set, the, template, for, islamic, medicine, which, rapidly, spread, throughout, the, arab, empire, its, most, famous, physicians, included, the, persian, polymaths, muhammad, ibn, zakar, ya, al, r, zi, and, avicenna, who, wrote, more, than, 40, works, on, health, medicine, and, well, being, taking, leads, from, greece, and, rome, islamic, scholars, kept, both, the, art, and, science, of, medicine, alive, and, moving, forward, persian, polymath, avicenna, has, also, been, called, the, father, of, medicine, he, wrote, the, canon, of, medicine, which, became, a, standard, medical, text, at, many, medieval, european, universities, considered, one, of, the, most, famous, books, in, the, history, of, medicine, the, canon, of, medicine, presents, an, overview, of, the, contemporary, medical, knowledge, of, the, medieval, islamic, world, which, had, been, influenced, by, earlier, traditions, including, greco, roman, medicine, particularly, galen, persian, medicine, chinese, medicine, and, indian, medicine, persian, physician, al, r, zi, was, one, of, the, first, to, question, the, greek, theory, of, humorism, which, nevertheless, remained, influential, in, both, medieval, western, and, medieval, islamic, medicine, some, volumes, of, al, r, zi, s, work, al, mansuri, namely, on, surgery, and, a, general, book, on, therapy, became, part, of, the, medical, curriculum, in, european, universities, additionally, he, has, been, described, as, a, doctor, s, doctor, the, father, of, pediatrics, and, a, pioneer, of, ophthalmology, for, example, he, was, the, first, to, recognize, the, reaction, of, the, eye, s, pupil, to, light, in, addition, to, contributions, to, humanity, s, understanding, of, human, anatomy, islamicate, scientists, and, scholars, physicians, specifically, played, an, invaluable, role, in, the, development, of, the, modern, hospital, system, creating, the, foundations, on, which, more, contemporary, medical, professionals, would, build, models, of, public, health, systems, in, europe, and, elsewhere, during, the, time, of, the, safavid, empire, 16th, 18th, centuries, in, iran, and, the, mughal, empire, 16th, 19th, centuries, in, india, muslim, scholars, radically, transformed, the, institution, of, the, hospital, creating, an, environment, in, which, rapidly, developing, medical, knowledge, of, the, time, could, be, passed, among, students, and, teachers, from, a, wide, range, of, cultures, there, were, two, main, schools, of, thought, with, patient, care, at, the, time, these, included, humoral, physiology, from, the, persians, and, ayurvedic, practice, after, these, theories, were, translated, from, sanskrit, to, persian, and, vice, versa, hospitals, could, have, a, mix, of, culture, and, techniques, this, allowed, for, a, sense, of, collaborative, medicine, hospitals, became, increasingly, common, during, this, period, as, wealthy, patrons, commonly, founded, them, many, features, that, are, still, in, use, today, such, as, an, emphasis, on, hygiene, a, staff, fully, dedicated, to, the, care, of, patients, and, separation, of, individual, patients, from, each, other, were, developed, in, islamicate, hospitals, long, before, they, came, into, practice, in, europe, at, the, time, the, patient, care, aspects, of, hospitals, in, europe, had, not, taken, effect, european, hospitals, were, places, of, religion, rather, than, institutions, of, science, as, was, the, case, with, much, of, the, scientific, work, done, by, islamicate, scholars, many, of, these, novel, developments, in, medical, practice, were, transmitted, to, european, cultures, hundreds, of, years, after, they, had, long, been, used, throughout, the, islamicate, world, although, islamicate, scientists, were, responsible, for, discovering, much, of, the, knowledge, that, allows, the, hospital, system, to, function, safely, today, european, scholars, who, built, on, this, work, still, receive, the, majority, of, the, credit, historically, before, the, development, of, scientific, medical, practices, in, the, islamicate, empires, medical, care, was, mainly, performed, by, religious, figures, such, as, priests, without, a, profound, understanding, of, how, infectious, diseases, worked, and, why, sickness, spread, from, person, to, person, these, early, attempts, at, caring, for, the, ill, and, injured, often, did, more, harm, than, good, contrarily, with, the, development, of, new, and, safer, practices, by, islamicate, scholars, and, physicians, in, arabian, hospitals, ideas, vital, for, the, effective, care, of, patients, were, developed, learned, and, transmitted, widely, hospitals, developed, novel, concepts, and, structures, which, are, still, in, use, today, separate, wards, for, male, and, female, patients, pharmacies, medical, record, keeping, and, personal, and, institutional, sanitation, and, hygiene, much, of, this, knowledge, was, recorded, and, passed, on, through, islamicate, medical, texts, many, of, which, were, carried, to, europe, and, translated, for, the, use, of, european, medical, workers, the, tasrif, written, by, surgeon, abu, al, qasim, al, zahrawi, was, translated, into, latin, it, became, one, of, the, most, important, medical, texts, in, european, universities, during, the, middle, ages, and, contained, useful, information, on, surgical, techniques, and, spread, of, bacterial, infection, the, hospital, was, a, typical, institution, included, in, the, majority, of, muslim, cities, and, although, they, were, often, physically, attached, to, religious, institutions, they, were, not, themselves, places, of, religious, practice, rather, they, served, as, facilities, in, which, education, and, scientific, innovation, could, flourish, if, they, had, places, of, worship, they, were, secondary, to, the, medical, side, of, the, hospital, islamicate, hospitals, along, with, observatories, used, for, astronomical, science, were, some, of, the, most, important, points, of, exchange, for, the, spread, of, scientific, knowledge, undoubtedly, the, hospital, system, developed, in, the, islamicate, world, played, an, invaluable, role, in, the, creation, and, evolution, of, the, hospitals, we, as, a, society, know, and, depend, on, today, after, 400, ce, the, study, and, practice, of, medicine, in, the, western, roman, empire, went, into, deep, decline, medical, services, were, provided, especially, for, the, poor, in, the, thousands, of, monastic, hospitals, that, sprang, up, across, europe, but, the, care, was, rudimentary, and, mainly, palliative, most, of, the, writings, of, galen, and, hippocrates, were, lost, to, the, west, with, the, summaries, and, compendia, of, st, isidore, of, seville, being, the, primary, channel, for, transmitting, greek, medical, ideas, the, carolingian, renaissance, brought, increased, contact, with, byzantium, and, a, greater, awareness, of, ancient, medicine, but, only, with, the, renaissance, of, the, 12th, century, and, the, new, translations, coming, from, muslim, and, jewish, sources, in, spain, and, the, fifteenth, century, flood, of, resources, after, the, fall, of, constantinople, did, the, west, fully, recover, its, acquaintance, with, classical, antiquity, greek, and, roman, taboos, had, meant, that, dissection, was, usually, banned, in, ancient, times, but, in, the, middle, ages, it, changed, medical, teachers, and, students, at, bologna, began, to, open, human, bodies, and, mondino, de, luzzi, c, 1275, 1326, produced, the, first, known, anatomy, textbook, based, on, human, dissection, wallis, identifies, a, prestige, hierarchy, with, university, educated, physicians, on, top, followed, by, learned, surgeons, craft, trained, surgeons, barber, surgeons, itinerant, specialists, such, as, dentist, and, oculists, empirics, and, midwives, the, first, medical, schools, were, opened, in, the, 9th, century, most, notably, the, schola, medica, salernitana, at, salerno, in, southern, italy, the, cosmopolitan, influences, from, greek, latin, arabic, and, hebrew, sources, gave, it, an, international, reputation, as, the, hippocratic, city, students, from, wealthy, families, came, for, three, years, of, preliminary, studies, and, five, of, medical, studies, the, medicine, following, the, laws, of, federico, ii, that, he, founded, in, 1224, the, university, and, improved, the, schola, salernitana, in, the, period, between, 1200, and, 1400, it, had, in, sicily, so, called, sicilian, middle, ages, a, particular, development, so, much, to, create, a, true, school, of, jewish, medicine, as, a, result, of, which, after, a, legal, examination, was, conferred, to, a, jewish, sicilian, woman, virdimura, wife, of, another, physician, pasquale, of, catania, the, historical, record, of, before, woman, officially, trained, to, exercise, of, the, medical, profession, at, the, university, of, bologna, the, training, of, physicians, began, in, 1219, the, italian, city, attracted, students, from, across, europe, taddeo, alderotti, built, a, tradition, of, medical, education, that, established, the, characteristic, features, of, italian, learned, medicine, and, was, copied, by, medical, schools, elsewhere, turisanus, d, 1320, was, his, student, the, university, of, padua, was, founded, about, 1220, by, walkouts, from, the, university, of, bologna, and, began, teaching, medicine, in, 1222, it, played, a, leading, role, in, the, identification, and, treatment, of, diseases, and, ailments, specializing, in, autopsies, and, the, inner, workings, of, the, body, starting, in, 1595, padua, s, famous, anatomical, theatre, drew, artists, and, scientists, studying, the, human, body, during, public, dissections, the, intensive, study, of, galen, led, to, critiques, of, galen, modeled, on, his, own, writing, as, in, the, first, book, of, vesalius, s, de, humani, corporis, fabrica, andreas, vesalius, held, the, chair, of, surgery, and, anatomy, explicator, chirurgiae, and, in, 1543, published, his, anatomical, discoveries, in, de, humani, corporis, fabrica, he, portrayed, the, human, body, as, an, interdependent, system, of, organ, groupings, the, book, triggered, great, public, interest, in, dissections, and, caused, many, other, european, cities, to, establish, anatomical, theatres, by, the, thirteenth, century, the, medical, school, at, montpellier, began, to, eclipse, the, salernitan, school, in, the, 12th, century, universities, were, founded, in, italy, france, and, england, which, soon, developed, schools, of, medicine, the, university, of, montpellier, in, france, and, italy, s, university, of, padua, and, university, of, bologna, were, leading, schools, nearly, all, the, learning, was, from, lectures, and, readings, in, hippocrates, galen, avicenna, and, aristotle, in, later, centuries, the, importance, of, universities, founded, in, the, late, middle, ages, gradually, increased, e, g, charles, university, in, prague, established, in, 1348, jagiellonian, university, in, krak, w, 1364, university, of, vienna, 1365, heidelberg, university, 1386, and, university, of, greifswald, 1456, in, 1376, in, sicily, it, was, historically, given, in, relationship, to, the, laws, of, federico, ii, that, they, foresaw, an, examination, with, a, regal, errand, of, physicists, the, first, qualification, to, the, exercise, of, the, medicine, to, a, woman, virdimura, a, jewish, woman, of, catania, whose, document, is, preserved, in, palermo, to, the, italian, national, archives, england, in, england, there, were, but, three, small, hospitals, after, 1550, pelling, and, webster, estimate, that, in, london, in, the, 1580, to, 1600, period, out, of, a, population, of, nearly, 200, 000, people, there, were, about, 500, medical, practitioners, nurses, and, midwives, are, not, included, there, were, about, 50, physicians, 100, licensed, surgeons, 100, apothecaries, and, 250, additional, unlicensed, practitioners, in, the, last, category, about, 25, were, women, all, across, england, and, indeed, all, of, the, world, the, vast, majority, of, the, people, in, city, town, or, countryside, depended, for, medical, care, on, local, amateurs, with, no, professional, training, but, with, a, reputation, as, wise, healers, who, could, diagnose, problems, and, advise, sick, people, what, to, do, and, perhaps, set, broken, bones, pull, a, tooth, give, some, traditional, herbs, or, brews, or, perform, a, little, magic, to, cure, what, ailed, them, the, renaissance, brought, an, intense, focus, on, scholarship, to, christian, europe, a, major, effort, to, translate, the, arabic, and, greek, scientific, works, into, latin, emerged, europeans, gradually, became, experts, not, only, in, the, ancient, writings, of, the, romans, and, greeks, but, in, the, contemporary, writings, of, islamic, scientists, during, the, later, centuries, of, the, renaissance, came, an, increase, in, experimental, investigation, particularly, in, the, field, of, dissection, and, body, examination, thus, advancing, our, knowledge, of, human, anatomy, at, the, university, of, bologna, the, curriculum, was, revised, and, strengthened, in, 1560, 1590, a, representative, professor, was, julius, caesar, aranzi, arantius, 1530, 1589, he, became, professor, of, anatomy, and, surgery, at, the, university, of, bologna, in, 1556, where, he, established, anatomy, as, a, major, branch, of, medicine, for, the, first, time, aranzi, combined,

that, good, works, were, the, route, to, heaven, the, protestant, reformers, rejected, the, notion, that, rich, men, could, gain, god, s, grace, through, good, works, and, thereby, escape, purgatory, by, providing, cash, endowments, to, charitable, institutions, they, also, rejected, the, catholic, idea, that, the, poor, patients, earned, grace, and, salvation, through, their, suffering,

allowed, two, hospitals, to, continue, their, charitable, work, under, nonreligious, control, of, city, officials, the, convents, were, all, shut, down, but, harkness, finds, that, women, some, of, them, former, nuns, were, part, of, a, new, system, that, delivered, essential, medical, services, to, people, outside, their, family, they, were, employed, by, parishes, and, hospitals, as, well, as, by, private, families, and, provided, nursing, care, as, well, as, some, medical, pharmaceutical, and, surgical, services, meanwhile, in, catholic, lands, such, as, france, rich, families, continued,

of, medical, training, for, physicians, and, the, creation, of, hospitals, epidemic, disease, had, decimated, indigenous, populations, starting, with, the, early, sixteenth, century, spanish, conquest, of, the, aztec, empire, when, a, black, auxiliary, in, the, armed, forces, of, conqueror, hern, n, cort, s, with, an, active, case, of, smallpox, set, off, a, virgin, land, epidemic, among, indigenous, peoples, spanish, allies, and, enemies, alike, aztec, emperor, cuitlahuac, died, of, smallpox, disease, was, a, significant, factor, in, the, spanish, conquest, elsewhere, as, well, medical, education, instituted, at, the, royal, and, pontifical, university, of, mexico, chiefly, served, the, needs, of, urban, elites, male, and, female, curanderos, or, lay, practitioners, attended, to, the, ills, of, the, popular, classes, the, spanish, crown, began, regulating, the, medical, profession, just, a, few, years, after, the, conquest, setting, up, the, royal, tribunal, of, the, protomedicato, a, board, for, licensing, medical, personnel, in, 1527, licensing, became, more, systematic, after, 1646, with, physicians, druggists, surgeons, and, bleeders, requiring, a, license, before, they, could, publicly, practice, crown, regulation, of, medical, practice, became, more, general, in, the, spanish, empire, elites, and, the, popular, classes, alike, called, on, divine, intervention, in, personal, and, society, wide, health, crises, such, as, the, epidemic, of, 1737, the, intervention, of, the, virgin, of, guadalupe, was, depicted, in, a, scene, of, dead, and, dying, indians, with, elites, on, their, knees, praying, for, her, aid, in, the, late, eighteenth, century, the, crown, began, implementing, secularizing, policies, on, the, iberian, peninsula, and, its, overseas, empire, to, control, disease, more, systematically, and, scientifically, spanish, quest, for, medicinal, spices, botanical, medicines, also, became, popular, during, the, 16th, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, spanish, pharmaceutical, books, during, this, time, contain, medicinal, recipes, consisting, of, spices, herbs, and, other, botanical, products, for, example, nutmeg, oil, was, documented, for, curing, stomach, ailments, and, cardamom, oil, was, believed, to, relieve, intestinal, ailments, during, the, rise, of, the, global, trade, market, spices, and, herbs, along, with, many, other, goods, that, were, indigenous, to, different, territories, began, to, appear, in, different, locations, across, the, globe, herbs, and, spices, were, especially, popular, for, their, utility, in, cooking, and, medicines, as, a, result, of, this, popularity, and, increased, demand, for, spices, some, areas, in, asia, like, china, and, indonesia, became, hubs, for, spice, cultivation, and, trade, the, spanish, empire, also, wanted, to, benefit, from, the, international, spice, trade, so, they, looked, towards, their, american, colonies, the, spanish, american, colonies, became, an, area, where, the, spanish, searched, to, discover, new, spices, and, indigenous, american, medicinal, recipes, the, florentine, codex, a, 16th, century, ethnographic, research, study, in, mesoamerica, by, the, spanish, franciscan, friar, bernardino, de, sahag, n, is, a, major, contribution, to, the, history, of, nahua, medicine, the, spanish, did, discover, many, spices, and, herbs, new, to, them, some, of, which, were, reportedly, similar, to, asian, spices, a, spanish, physician, by, the, name, of, nicol, s, monardes, studied, many, of, the, american, spices, coming, into, spain, he, documented, many, of, the, new, american, spices, and, their, medicinal, properties, in, his, survey, historia, medicinal, de, las, cosas, que, se, traen, de, nuestras, indias, occidentales, for, example, monardes, describes, the, long, pepper, pimienta, luenga, found, along, the, coasts, of, the, countries, that, are, now, known, panama, and, colombia, as, a, pepper, that, was, more, flavorful, healthy, and, spicy, in, comparison, to, the, eastern, black, pepper, the, spanish, interest, in, american, spices, can, first, be, seen, in, the, commissioning, of, the, libellus, de, medicinalibus, indorum, herbis, which, was, a, spanish, american, codex, describing, indigenous, american, spices, and, herbs, and, describing, the, ways, that, these, were, used, in, natural, aztec, medicines, the, codex, was, commissioned, in, the, year, 1552, by, francisco, de, mendoza, the, son, of, antonio, de, mendoza, who, was, the, first, viceroy, of, new, spain, francisco, de, mendoza, was, interested, in, studying, the, properties, of, these, herbs, and, spices, so, that, he, would, be, able, to, profit, from, the, trade, of, these, herbs, and, the, medicines, that, could, be, produced, by, them, francisco, de, mendoza, recruited, the, help, of, monardez, in, studying, the, traditional, medicines, of, the, indigenous, people, living, in, what, was, then, the, spanish, colonies, monardez, researched, these, medicines, and, performed, experiments, to, discover, the, possibilities, of, spice, cultivation, and, medicine, creation, in, the, spanish, colonies, the, spanish, transplanted, some, herbs, from, asia, but, only, a, few, foreign, crops, were, successfully, grown, in, the, spanish, colonies, one, notable, crop, brought, from, asia, and, successfully, grown, in, the, spanish, colonies, was, ginger, as, it, was, considered, hispaniola, s, number, 1, crop, at, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, the, spanish, empire, did, profit, from, cultivating, herbs, and, spices, but, they, also, introduced, pre, columbian, american, medicinal, knowledge, to, europe, other, europeans, were, inspired, by, the, actions, of, spain, and, decided, to, try, to, establish, a, botanical, transplant, system, in, colonies, that, they, controlled, however, these, subsequent, attempts, were, not, successful, united, kingdom, and, the, british, empire, the, london, dispensary, opened, in, 1696, the, first, clinic, in, the, british, empire, to, dispense, medicines, to, poor, sick, people, the, innovation, was, slow, to, catch, on, but, new, dispensaries, were, open, in, the, 1770s, in, the, colonies, small, hospitals, opened, in, philadelphia, in, 1752, new, york, in, 1771, and, boston, massachusetts, general, hospital, in, 1811, guy, s, hospital, the, first, great, british, hospital, with, a, modern, foundation, opened, in, 1721, in, london, with, funding, from, businessman, thomas, guy, it, had, been, preceded, by, st, bartholomew, s, hospital, and, st, thomas, s, hospital, both, medieval, foundations, in, 1821, a, bequest, of, 200, 000, by, william, hunt, in, 1829, funded, expansion, for, an, additional, hundred, beds, at, guy, s, samuel, sharp, 1709, 78, a, surgeon, at, guy, s, hospital, from, 1733, to, 1757, was, internationally, famous, his, a, treatise, on, the, operations, of, surgery, 1st, ed, 1739, was, the, first, british, study, focused, exclusively, on, operative, technique, english, physician, thomas, percival, 1740, 1804, wrote, a, comprehensive, system, of, medical, conduct, medical, ethics, or, a, code, of, institutes, and, precepts, adapted, to, the, professional, conduct, of, physicians, and, surgeons, 1803, that, set, the, standard, for, many, textbooks, in, the, 1830s, in, italy, agostino, bassi, traced, the, silkworm, disease, muscardine, to, microorganisms, meanwhile, in, germany, theodor, schwann, led, research, on, alcoholic, fermentation, by, yeast, proposing, that, living, microorganisms, were, responsible, leading, chemists, such, as, justus, von, liebig, seeking, solely, physicochemical, explanations, derided, this, claim, and, alleged, that, schwann, was, regressing, to, vitalism, in, 1847, in, vienna, ignaz, semmelweis, 1818, 1865, dramatically, reduced, the, death, rate, of, new, mothers, due, to, childbed, fever, by, requiring, physicians, to, clean, their, hands, before, attending, childbirth, yet, his, principles, were, marginalized, and, attacked, by, professional, peers, at, that, time, most, people, still, believed, that, infections, were, caused, by, foul, odors, called, miasmas, french, scientist, louis, pasteur, confirmed, schwann, s, fermentation, experiments, in, 1857, and, afterwards, supported, the, hypothesis, that, yeast, were, microorganisms, moreover, he, suggested, that, such, a, process, might, also, explain, contagious, disease, in, 1860, pasteur, s, report, on, bacterial, fermentation, of, butyric, acid, motivated, fellow, frenchman, casimir, davaine, to, identify, a, similar, species, which, he, called, bacteridia, as, the, pathogen, of, the, deadly, disease, anthrax, others, dismissed, bacteridia, as, a, mere, byproduct, of, the, disease, british, surgeon, joseph, lister, however, took, these, findings, seriously, and, subsequently, introduced, antisepsis, to, wound, treatment, in, 1865, german, physician, robert, koch, noting, fellow, german, ferdinand, cohn, s, report, of, a, spore, stage, of, a, certain, bacterial, species, traced, the, life, cycle, of, davaine, s, bacteridia, identified, spores, inoculated, laboratory, animals, with, them, and, reproduced, anthrax, a, breakthrough, for, experimental, pathology, and, germ, theory, of, disease, pasteur, s, group, added, ecological, investigations, confirming, spores, role, in, the, natural, setting, while, koch, published, a, landmark, treatise, in, 1878, on, the, bacterial, pathology, of, wounds, in, 1881, koch, reported, discovery, of, the, tubercle, bacillus, cementing, germ, theory, and, koch, s, acclaim, upon, the, outbreak, of, a, cholera, epidemic, in, alexandria, egypt, two, medical, missions, went, to, investigate, and, attend, the, sick, one, was, sent, out, by, pasteur, and, the, other, led, by, koch, koch, s, group, returned, in, 1883, having, successfully, discovered, the, cholera, pathogen, in, germany, however, koch, s, bacteriologists, had, to, vie, against, max, von, pettenkofer, germany, s, leading, proponent, of, miasmatic, theory, pettenkofer, conceded, bacteria, s, casual, involvement, but, maintained, that, other, environmental, factors, were, required, to, turn, it, pathogenic, and, opposed, water, treatment, as, a, misdirected, effort, amid, more, important, ways, to, improve, public, health, the, massive, cholera, epidemic, in, hamburg, in, 1892, devastated, pettenkoffer, s, position, and, yielded, german, public, health, to, koch, s, bacteriology, on, losing, the, 1883, rivalry, in, alexandria, pasteur, switched, research, direction, and, introduced, his, third, vaccine, rabies, vaccine, the, first, vaccine, for, humans, since, jenner, s, for, smallpox, from, across, the, globe, donations, poured, in, funding, the, founding, of, pasteur, institute, the, globe, s, first, biomedical, institute, which, opened, in, 1888, along, with, koch, s, bacteriologists, pasteur, s, group, which, preferred, the, term, microbiology, led, medicine, into, the, new, era, of, scientific, medicine, upon, bacteriology, and, germ, theory, accepted, from, jakob, henle, koch, s, steps, to, confirm, a, species, pathogenicity, became, famed, as, koch, s, postulates, although, his, proposed, tuberculosis, treatment, tuberculin, seemingly, failed, it, soon, was, used, to, test, for, infection, with, the, involved, species, in, 1905, koch, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, and, remains, renowned, as, the, founder, of, medical, microbiology, the, breakthrough, to, professionalization, based, on, knowledge, of, advanced, medicine, was, led, by, florence, nightingale, in, england, she, resolved, to, provide, more, advanced, training, than, she, saw, on, the, continent, at, kaiserswerth, where, the, first, german, nursing, schools, were, founded, in, 1836, by, theodor, fliedner, she, said, the, nursing, was, nil, and, the, hygiene, horrible, britain, s, male, doctors, preferred, the, old, system, but, nightingale, won, out, and, her, nightingale, training, school, opened, in, 1860, and, became, a, model, the, nightingale, solution, depended, on, the, patronage, of, upper, class, women, and, they, proved, eager, to, serve, royalty, became, involved, in, 1902, the, wife, of, the, british, king, took, control, of, the, nursing, unit, of, the, british, army, became, its, president, and, renamed, it, after, herself, as, the, queen, alexandra, s, royal, army, nursing, corps, when, she, died, the, next, queen, became, president, today, its, colonel, in, chief, is, sophie, countess, of, wessex, the, daughter, in, law, of, queen, elizabeth, ii, in, the, united, states, upper, middle, class, women, who, already, supported, hospitals, promoted, nursing, the, new, profession, proved, highly, attractive, to, women, of, all, backgrounds, and, schools, of, nursing, opened, in, the, late, 19th, century, nurses, were, soon, a, part, of, large, hospitals, where, they, provided, a, steady, stream, of, low, paid, idealistic, workers, the, international, red, cross, began, operations, in, numerous, countries, in, the, late, 19th, century, promoting, nursing, as, an, ideal, profession, for, middle, class, women, a, major, breakthrough, in, epidemiology, came, with, the, introduction, of, statistical, maps, and, graphs, they, allowed, careful, analysis, of, seasonality, issues, in, disease, incidents, and, the, maps, allowed, public, health, officials, to, identify, critical, loci, for, the, dissemination, of, disease, john, snow, in, london, developed, the, methods, in, 1849, he, observed, that, the, symptoms, of, cholera, which, had, already, claimed, around, 500, lives, within, a, month, were, vomiting, and, diarrhoea, he, concluded, that, the, source, of, contamination, must, be, through, ingestion, rather, than, inhalation, as, was, previously, thought, it, was, this, insight, that, resulted, in, the, removal, of, the, pump, on, broad, street, after, which, deaths, from, cholera, plummeted, english, nurse, florence, nightingale, pioneered, analysis, of, large, amounts, of, statistical, data, using, graphs, and, tables, regarding, the, condition, of, thousands, of, patients, in, the, crimean, war, to, evaluate, the, efficacy, of, hospital, services, her, methods, proved, convincing, and, led, to, reforms, in, military, and, civilian, hospitals, usually, with, the, full, support, of, the, government, by, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, english, statisticians, led, by, francis, galton, karl, pearson, and, ronald, fisher, developed, the, mathematical, tools, such, as, correlations, and, hypothesis, tests, that, made, possible, much, more, sophisticated, analysis, of, statistical, data, during, the, u, s, civil, war, the, sanitary, commission, collected, enormous, amounts, of, statistical, data, and, opened, up, the, problems, of, storing, information, for, fast, access, and, mechanically, searching, for, data, patterns, the, pioneer, was, john, shaw, billings, 1838, 1913, a, senior, surgeon, in, the, war, billings, built, the, library, of, the, surgeon, general, s, office, now, the, national, library, of, medicine, the, centerpiece, of, modern, medical, information, systems, billings, figured, out, how, to, mechanically, analyze, medical, and, demographic, data, by, turning, facts, into, numbers, and, punching, the, numbers, onto, cardboard, cards, that, could, be, sorted, and, counted, by, machine, the, applications, were, developed, by, his, assistant, herman, hollerith, hollerith, invented, the, punch, card, and, counter, sorter, system, that, dominated, statistical, data, manipulation, until, the, 1970s, hollerith, s, company, became, international, business, machines, ibm, in, 1911, until, the, nineteenth, century, the, care, of, the, insane, was, largely, a, communal, and, family, responsibility, rather, than, a, medical, one, the, vast, majority, of, the, mentally, ill, were, treated, in, domestic, contexts, with, only, the, most, unmanageable, or, burdensome, likely, to, be, institutionally, confined, this, situation, was, transformed, radically, from, the, late, eighteenth, century, as, amid, changing, cultural, conceptions, of, madness, a, new, found, optimism, in, the, curability, of, insanity, within, the, asylum, setting, emerged, increasingly, lunacy, was, perceived, less, as, a, physiological, condition, than, as, a, mental, and, moral, one, to, which, the, correct, response, was, persuasion, aimed, at, inculcating, internal, restraint, rather, than, external, coercion, this, new, therapeutic, sensibility, referred, to, as, moral, treatment, was, epitomised, in, french, physician, philippe, pinel, s, quasi, mythological, unchaining, of, the, lunatics, of, the, bic, tre, hospital, in, paris, and, realised, in, an, institutional, setting, with, the, foundation, in, 1796, of, the, quaker, run, york, retreat, in, england, from, the, early, nineteenth, century, as, lay, led, lunacy, reform, movements, gained, in, influence, ever, more, state, governments, in, the, west, extended, their, authority, and, responsibility, over, the, mentally, ill, small, scale, asylums, conceived, as, instruments, to, reshape, both, the, mind, and, behaviour, of, the, disturbed, proliferated, across, these, regions, by, the, 1830s, moral, treatment, together, with, the, asylum, itself, became, increasingly, medicalised, and, asylum, doctors, began, to, establish, a, distinct, medical, identity, with, the, establishment, in, the, 1840s, of, associations, for, their, members, in, france, germany, the, united, kingdom, and, america, together, with, the, founding, of, medico, psychological, journals, medical, optimism, in, the, capacity, of, the, asylum, to, cure, insanity, soured, by, the, close, of, the, nineteenth, century, as, the, growth, of, the, asylum, population, far, outstripped, that, of, the, general, population, processes, of, long, term, institutional, segregation, allowing, for, the, psychiatric, conceptualisation, of, the, natural, course, of, mental, illness, supported, the, perspective, that, the, insane, were, a, distinct, population, subject, to, mental, pathologies, stemming, from, specific, medical, causes, as, degeneration, theory, grew, in, influence, from, the, mid, nineteenth, century, heredity, was, seen, as, the, central, causal, element, in, chronic, mental, illness, and, with, national, asylum, systems, overcrowded, and, insanity, apparently, undergoing, an, inexorable, rise, the, focus, of, psychiatric, therapeutics, shifted, from, a, concern, with, treating, the, individual, to, maintaining, the, racial, and, biological, health, of, national, populations, emil, kraepelin, 1856, 1926, introduced, new, medical, categories, of, mental, illness, which, eventually, came, into, psychiatric, usage, despite, their, basis, in, behavior, rather, than, pathology, or, underlying, cause, shell, shock, among, frontline, soldiers, exposed, to, heavy, artillery, bombardment, was, first, diagnosed, by, british, army, doctors, in, 1915, by, 1916, similar, symptoms, were, also, noted, in, soldiers, not, exposed, to, explosive, shocks, leading, to, questions, as, to, whether, the, disorder, was, physical, or, psychiatric, in, the, 1920s, surrealist, opposition, to, psychiatry, was, expressed, in, a, number, of, surrealist, publications, in, the, 1930s, several, controversial, medical, practices, were, introduced, including, inducing, seizures, by, electroshock, insulin, or, other, drugs, or, cutting, parts, of, the, brain, apart, leucotomy, or, lobotomy, both, came, into, widespread, use, by, psychiatry, but, there, were, grave, concerns, and, much, opposition, on, grounds, of, basic, morality, harmful, effects, or, misuse, in, the, 1950s, new, psychiatric, drugs, notably, the, antipsychotic, chlorpromazine, were, designed, in, laboratories, and, slowly, came, into, preferred, use, although, often, accepted, as, an, advance, in, some, ways, there, was, some, opposition, due, to, serious, adverse, effects, such, as, tardive, dyskinesia, patients, often, opposed, psychiatry, and, refused, or, stopped, taking, the, drugs, when, not, subject, to, psychiatric, control, there, was, also, increasing, opposition, to, the, use, of, psychiatric, hospitals, and, attempts, to, move, people, back, into, the, community, on, a, collaborative, user, led, group, approach, therapeutic, communities, not, controlled, by, psychiatry, campaigns, against, masturbation, were, done, in, the, victorian, era, and, elsewhere, lobotomy, was, used, until, the, 1970s, to, treat, schizophrenia, this, was, denounced, by, the, anti, psychiatric, movement, in, the, 1960s, and, later, it, was, very, difficult, for, women, to, become, doctors, in, any, field, before, the, 1970s, elizabeth, blackwell, became, the, first, woman, to, formally, study, and, practice, medicine, in, the, united, states, she, was, a, leader, in, women, s, medical, education, while, blackwell, viewed, medicine, as, a, means, for, social, and, moral, reform, her, student, mary, putnam, jacobi, 1842, 1906, focused, on, curing, disease, at, a, deeper, level, of, disagreement, blackwell, felt, that, women, would, succeed, in, medicine, because, of, their, humane, female, values, but, jacobi, believed, that, women, should, participate, as, the, equals, of, men, in, all, medical, specialties, using, identical, methods, values, and, insights, in, the, soviet, union, although, the, majority, of, medical, doctors, were, women, they, were, paid, less, than, the, mostly, male, factory, workers, china, finally, in, the, 19th, century, western, medicine, was, introduced, at, the, local, level, by, christian, medical, missionaries, from, the, london, missionary, society, britain, the, methodist, church, britain, and, the, presbyterian, church, us, benjamin, hobson, 1816, 1873, in, 1839, set, up, a, highly, successful, wai, ai, clinic, in, guangzhou, china, the, hong, kong, college, of, medicine, for, chinese, was, founded, in, 1887, by, the, london, missionary, society, with, its, first, graduate, in, 1892, being, sun, yat, sen, who, later, led, the, chinese, revolution, 1911, the, hong, kong, college, of, medicine, for, chinese, was, the, forerunner, of, the, school, of, medicine, of, the, university, of, hong, kong, which, started, in, 1911, because, of, the, social, custom, that, men, and, women, should, not, be, near, to, one, another, the, women, of, china, were, reluctant, to, be, treated, by, male, doctors, the, missionaries, sent, women, doctors, such, as, dr, mary, hannah, fulton, 1854, 1927, supported, by, the, foreign, missions, board, of, the, presbyterian, church, us, she, in, 1902, founded, the, first, medical, college, for, women, in, china, the, hackett, medical, college, for, women, in, guangzhou, japan, european, ideas, of, modern, medicine, were, spread, widely, through, the, world, by, medical, missionaries, and, the, dissemination, of, textbooks, japanese, elites, enthusiastically, embraced, western, medicine, after, the, meiji, restoration, of, the, 1860s, however, they, had, been, prepared, by, their, knowledge, of, the, dutch, and, german, medicine, for, they, had, some, contact, with, europe, through, the, dutch, highly, influential, was, the, 1765, edition, of, hendrik, van, deventer, s, pioneer, work, nieuw, ligt, a, new, light, on, japanese, obstetrics, especially, on, katakura, kakuryo, s, publication, in, 1799, of, sanka, hatsumo, enlightenment, of, obstetrics, a, cadre, of, japanese, physicians, began, to, interact, with, dutch, doctors, who, introduced, smallpox, vaccinations, by, 1820, japanese, ranp, medical, practitioners, not, only, translated, dutch, medical, texts, they, integrated, their, readings, with, clinical, diagnoses, these, men, became, leaders, of, the, modernization, of, medicine, in, their, country, they, broke, from, japanese, traditions, of, closed, medical, fraternities, and, adopted, the, european, approach, of, an, open, community, of, collaboration, based, on, expertise, in, the, latest, scientific, methods, kitasato, shibasabur, 1853, 1931, studied, bacteriology, in, germany, under, robert, koch, in, 1891, he, founded, the, institute, of, infectious, diseases, in, tokyo, which, introduced, the, study, of, bacteriology, to, japan, he, and, french, researcher, alexandre, yersin, went, to, hong, kong, in, 1894, where, kitasato, confirmed, yersin, s, discovery, that, the, bacterium, yersinia, pestis, is, the, agent, of, the, plague, in, 1897, he, isolated, and, described, the, organism, that, caused, dysentery, he, became, the, first, dean, of, medicine, at, keio, university, and, the, first, president, of, the, japan, medical, association, japanese, physicians, immediately, recognized, the, values, of, x, rays, they, were, able, to, purchase, the, equipment, locally, from, the, shimadzu, company, which, developed, manufactured, marketed, and, distributed, x, ray, machines, after, 1900, japan, not, only, adopted, german, methods, of, public, health, in, the, home, islands, but, implemented, them, in, its, colonies, especially, korea, and, taiwan, and, after, 1931, in, manchuria, a, heavy, investment, in, sanitation, resulted, in, a, dramatic, increase, of, life, expectancy, the, practice, of, medicine, changed, in, the, face, of, rapid, advances, in, science, as, well, as, new, approaches, by, physicians, hospital, doctors, began, much, more, systematic, analysis, of, patients, symptoms, in, diagnosis, among, the, more, powerful, new, techniques, were, anaesthesia, and, the, development, of, both, antiseptic, and, aseptic, operating, theatres, effective, cures, were, developed, for, certain, endemic, infectious, diseases, however, the, decline, in, many, of, the, most, lethal, diseases, was, due, more, to, improvements, in, public, health, and, nutrition, than, to, advances, in, medicine, medicine, was, revolutionized, in, the, 19th, century, and, beyond, by, advances, in, chemistry, laboratory, techniques, and, equipment, old, ideas, of, infectious, disease, epidemiology, were, gradually, replaced, by, advances, in, bacteriology, and, virology, the, russian, orthodox, church, sponsored, seven, orders, of, nursing, sisters, in, the, late, 19th, century, they, ran, hospitals, clinics, almshouses, pharmacies, and, shelters, as, well, as, training, schools, for, nurses, in, the, soviet, era, 1917, 1991, with, the, aristocratic, sponsors, gone, nursing, became, a, low, prestige, occupation, based, in, poorly, maintained, hospitals, paris, france, and, vienna, were, the, two, leading, medical, centers, on, the, continent, in, the, era, 1750, 1914, in, the, 1770s, 1850s, paris, became, a, world, center, of, medical, research, and, teaching, the, paris, school, emphasized, that, teaching, and, research, should, be, based, in, large, hospitals, and, promoted, the, professionalization, of, the, medical, profession, and, the, emphasis, on, sanitation, and, public, health, a, major, reformer, was, jean, antoine, chaptal, 1756, 1832, a, physician, who, was, minister, of, internal, affairs, he, created, the, paris, hospital, health, councils, and, other, bodies, louis, pasteur, 1822, 1895, was, one, of, the, most, important, founders, of, medical, microbiology, he, is, remembered, for, his, remarkable, breakthroughs, in, the, causes, and, preventions, of, diseases, his, discoveries, reduced, mortality, from, puerperal, fever, and, he, created, the, first, vaccines, for, rabies, and, anthrax, his, experiments, supported, the, germ, theory, of, disease, he, was, best, known, to, the, general, public, for, inventing, a, method, to, treat, milk, and, wine, to, prevent, it, from, causing, sickness, a, process, that, came, to, be, called, pasteurization, he, is, regarded, as, one, of, the, three, main, founders, of, microbiology, together, with, ferdinand, cohn, and, robert, koch, he, worked, chiefly, in, paris, and, in, 1887, founded, the, pasteur, institute, there, to, perpetuate, his, commitment, to, basic, research, and, its, practical, applications, as, soon, as, his, institute, was, created, pasteur, brought, together, scientists, with, various, specialties, the, first, five, departments, were, directed, by, emile, duclaux, general, microbiology, research, and, charles, chamberland, microbe, research, applied, to, hygiene, as, well, as, a, biologist, ilya, ilyich, mechnikov, morphological, microbe, research, and, two, physicians, jacques, joseph, grancher, rabies, and, emile, roux, technical, microbe, research, one, year, after, the, inauguration, of, the, institut, pasteur, roux, set, up, the, first, course, of, microbiology, ever, taught, in, the, world, then, entitled, cours, de, microbie, technique, course, of, microbe, research, techniques, it, became, the, model, for, numerous, research, centers, around, the, world, named, pasteur, institutes, the, first, viennese, school, of, medicine, 1750, 1800, was, led, by, the, dutchman, gerard, van, swieten, 1700, 1772, who, aimed, to, put, medicine, on, new, scientific, foundations, promoting, unprejudiced, clinical, observation, botanical, and, chemical, research, and, introducing, simple, but, powerful, remedies, when, the, vienna, general, hospital, opened, in, 1784, it, at, once, became, the, world, s, largest, hospital, and, physicians, acquired, a, facility, that, gradually, developed, into, the, most, important, research, centre, progress, ended, with, the, napoleonic, wars, and, the, government, shutdown, in, 1819, of, all, liberal, journals, and, schools, this, caused, a, general, return, to, traditionalism, and, eclecticism, in, medicine, vienna, was, the, capital, of, a, diverse, empire, and, attracted, not, just, germans, but, czechs, hungarians, jews, poles, and, others, to, its, world, class, medical, facilities, after, 1820, the, second, viennese, school, of, medicine, emerged, with, the, contributions, of, physicians, such, as, carl, freiherr, von, rokitansky, josef, koda, ferdinand, ritter, von, hebra, and, ignaz, philipp, semmelweis, basic, medical, science, expanded, and, specialization, advanced, furthermore, the, first, dermatology, eye, as, well, as, ear, nose, and, throat, clinics, in, the, world, were, founded, in, vienna, the, textbook, of, ophthalmologist, georg, joseph, beer, 1763, 1821, lehre, von, den, augenkrankheiten, combined, practical, research, and, philosophical, speculations, and, became, the, standard, reference, work, for, decades, after, 1871, berlin, the, capital, of, the, new, german, empire, became, a, leading, center, for, medical, research, the, charit, is, tracing, back, its, origins, to, the, year, 1710, more, than, half, of, all, german, nobel, prize, winners, in, physiology, or, medicine, including, emil, von, behring, robert, koch, and, paul, ehrlich, worked, there, koch, 1843, 1910, was, a, representative, leader, he, became, famous, for, isolating, bacillus, anthracis, 1877, the, tuberculosis, bacillus, 1882, and, vibrio, cholerae, 1883, and, for, his, development, of, koch, s, postulates, he, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, in, 1905, for, his, tuberculosis, findings, koch, is, one, of, the, founders, of, microbiology, and, modern, medicine, he, inspired, such, major, figures, as, ehrlich, who, discovered, the, first, antibiotic, arsphenamine, and, gerhard, domagk, who, created, the, first, commercially, available, antibiotic, prontosil, american, civil, war, in, the, american, civil, war, 1861, 65, as, was, typical, of, the, 19th, century, more, soldiers, died, of, disease, than, in, battle, and, even, larger, numbers, were, temporarily, incapacitated, by, wounds, disease, and, accidents, conditions, were, poor, in, the, confederacy, where, doctors, and, medical, supplies, were, in, short, supply, the, war, had, a, dramatic, long, term, impact, on, medicine, in, the, u, s, from, surgical, technique, to, hospitals, to, nursing, and, to, research, facilities, weapon, development, particularly, the, appearance, of, springfield, model, 1861, mass, produced, and, much, more, accurate, than, muskets, led, to, generals, underestimating, the, risks, of, long, range, rifle, fire, risks, exemplified, in, the, death, of, john, sedgwick, and, the, disastrous, pickett, s, charge, the, rifles, could, shatter, bone, forcing, amputation, and, longer, ranges, meant, casualties, were, sometimes, not, quickly, found, evacuation, of, the, wounded, from, second, battle, of, bull, run, took, a, week, as, in, earlier, wars, untreated, casualties, sometimes, survived, unexpectedly, due, to, maggots, debriding, the, wound, an, observation, which, led, to, the, surgical, use, of, maggots, still, a, useful, method, in, the, absence, of, effective, antibiotics, the, hygiene, of, the, training, and, field, camps, was, poor, especially, at, the, beginning, of, the, war, when, men, who, had, seldom, been, far, from, home, were, brought, together, for, training, with, thousands, of, strangers, first, came, epidemics, of, the, childhood, diseases, of, chicken, pox, mumps, whooping, cough, and, especially, measles, operations, in, the, south, meant, a, dangerous, and, new, disease, environment, bringing, diarrhea, dysentery, typhoid, fever, and, malaria, there, were, no, antibiotics, so, the, surgeons, prescribed, coffee, whiskey, and, quinine, harsh, weather, bad, water, inadequate, shelter, in, winter, quarters, poor, policing, of, camps, and, dirty, camp, hospitals, took, their, toll, this, was, a, common, scenario, in, wars, from, time, immemorial, and, conditions, faced, by, the, confederate, army, were, even, worse, the, union, responded, by, building, army, hospitals, in, every, state, what, was, different, in, the, union, was, the, emergence, of, skilled, well, funded, medical, organizers, who, took, proactive, action, especially, in, the, much, enlarged, united, states, army, medical, department, and, the, united, states, sanitary, commission, a, new, private, agency, numerous, other, new, agencies, also, targeted, the, medical, and, morale, needs, of, soldiers, including, the, united, states, christian, commission, as, well, as, smaller, private, agencies, the, u, s, army, learned, many, lessons, and, in, august, 1886, it, established, the, hospital, corps, johns, hopkins, hospital, founded, in, 1889, originated, several, modern, medical, practices, including, residency, and, rounds, the, abo, blood, group, system, was, discovered, in, 1901, by, karl, landsteiner, at, the, university, of, vienna, landsteiner, experimented, on, his, staff, mixing, their, various, blood, components, together, and, found, that, some, people, s, blood, agglutinated, clumped, together, with, other, blood, while, some, did, not, this, then, lead, him, identifying, three, blood, groups, abc, which, would, later, be, renamed, to, abo, the, less, frequently, found, blood, group, ab, was, discovered, later, in, 1902, by, alfred, von, decastello, and, adriano, sturli, in, 1937, landsteiner, and, alexander, s, wiener, further, discovered, the, rh, factor, misnamed, from, early, thinking, that, this, blood, group, was, similar, to, that, found, in, rhesus, monkeys, whose, antigens, further, determine, blood, reaction, between, people, this, was, demonstrated, in, a, 1939, case, study, by, phillip, levine, and, rufus, stetson, where, a, mother, who, had, recently, given, birth, had, reacted, to, their, partner, s, blood, highlighting, the, rh, factor, canadian, physician, norman, bethune, m, d, developed, a, mobile, blood, transfusion, service, for, frontline, operations, in, the, spanish, civil, war, 1936, 1939, but, ironically, he, himself, died, of, sepsis, in, 1958, arne, larsson, in, sweden, became, the, first, patient, to, depend, on, an, artificial, cardiac, pacemaker, he, died, in, 2001, at, age, 86, having, outlived, its, inventor, the, surgeon, and, 26, pacemakers, cancer, treatment, has, been, developed, with, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and, surgical, oncology, x, ray, imaging, was, the, first, kind, of, medical, imaging, and, later, ultrasonic, imaging, ct, scanning, mr, scanning, and, other, imaging, methods, became, available, prosthetics, have, improved, with, lightweight, materials, as, well, as, neural, prosthetics, emerging, in, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, oral, rehydration, therapy, has, been, extensively, used, since, the, 1970s, to, treat, cholera, and, other, diarrhea, inducing, infections, as, infectious, diseases, have, become, less, lethal, and, the, most, common, causes, of, death, in, developed, countries, are, now, tumors, and, cardiovascular, diseases, these, conditions, have, received, increased, attention, in, medical, research, starting, in, world, war, ii, ddt, was, used, as, insecticide, to, combat, insect, vectors, carrying, malaria, which, was, endemic, in, most, tropical, regions, of, the, world, the, first, goal, was, to, protect, soldiers, but, it, was, widely, adopted, as, a, public, health, device, in, liberia, for, example, the, united, states, had, large, military, operations, during, the, war, and, the, u, s, public, health, service, began, the, use, of, ddt, for, indoor, residual, spraying, irs, and, as, a, larvicide, with, the, goal, of, controlling, malaria, in, monrovia, the, liberian, capital, in, the, early, 1950s, the, project, was, expanded, to, nearby, villages, in, 1953, the, world, health, organization, who, launched, an, antimalaria, program, in, parts, of, liberia, as, a, pilot, project, to, determine, the, feasibility, of, malaria, eradication, in, tropical, africa, however, these, projects, encountered, a, spate, of, difficulties, that, foreshadowed, the, general, retreat, from, malaria, eradication, efforts, across, tropical, africa, by, the, mid, 1960s, the, 1918, influenza, pandemic, was, a, global, pandemic, in, the, early, 20th, century, that, occurred, between, 1918, and, 1920, sometimes, known, as, spanish, flu, due, to, popular, opinion, at, the, time, thinking, the, flu, originated, from, spain, this, pandemic, caused, close, to, 50, million, deaths, around, the, world, spreading, at, the, end, of, world, war, i, public, health, measures, became, particularly, important, during, the, 1918, flu, pandemic, which, killed, at, least, 50, million, people, around, the, world, it, became, an, important, case, study, in, epidemiology, bristow, shows, there, was, a, gendered, response, of, health, caregivers, to, the, pandemic, in, the, united, states, male, doctors, were, unable, to, cure, the, patients, and, they, felt, like, failures, women, nurses, also, saw, their, patients, die, but, they, took, pride, in, their, success, in, fulfilling, their, professional, role, of, caring, for, ministering, comforting, and, easing, the, last, hours, of, their, patients, and, helping, the, families, of, the, patients, cope, as, well, evidence, based, medicine, is, a, modern, concept, not, introduced, to, literature, until, the, 1990s, the, sexual, revolution, included, taboo, breaking, research, in, human, sexuality, such, as, the, 1948, and, 1953, kinsey, reports, invention, of, hormonal, contraception, and, the, normalization, of, abortion, and, homosexuality, in, many, countries, family, planning, has, promoted, a, demographic, transition, in, most, of, the, world, with, threatening, sexually, transmitted, infections, not, least, hiv, use, of, barrier, contraception, has, become, imperative, the, struggle, against, hiv, has, improved, antiretroviral, treatments, tobacco, smoking, as, a, cause, of, lung, cancer, was, first, researched, in, the, 1920s, but, was, not, widely, supported, by, publications, until, the, 1950s, cardiac, surgery, was, revolutionized, in, 1948, as, open, heart, surgery, was, introduced, for, the, first, time, since, 1925, in, 1954, joseph, murray, j, hartwell, harrison, and, others, accomplished, the, first, kidney, transplantation, transplantations, of, other, organs, such, as, heart, liver, and, pancreas, were, also, introduced, during, the, later, 20th, century, the, first, partial, face, transplant, was, performed, in, 2005, and, the, first, full, one, in, 2010, by, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, microtechnology, had, been, used, to, create, tiny, robotic, devices, to, assist, microsurgery, using, micro, video, and, fiber, optic, cameras, to, view, internal, tissues, during, surgery, with, minimally, invasive, practices, laparoscopic, surgery, was, broadly, introduced, in, the, 1990s, natural, orifice, surgery, has, followed, during, the, 19th, century, large, scale, wars, were, attended, with, medics, and, mobile, hospital, units, which, developed, advanced, techniques, for, healing, massive, injuries, and, controlling, infections, rampant, in, battlefield, conditions, during, the, mexican, revolution, 1910, 1920, general, pancho, villa, organized, hospital, trains, for, wounded, soldiers, boxcars, marked, servicio, sanitario, sanitary, service, were, re, purposed, as, surgical, operating, theaters, and, areas, for, recuperation, and, staffed, by, up, to, 40, mexican, and, u, s, physicians, severely, wounded, soldiers, were, shuttled, back, to, base, hospitals, thousands, of, scarred, troops, provided, the, need, for, improved, prosthetic, limbs, and, expanded, techniques, in, plastic, surgery, or, reconstructive, surgery, those, practices, were, combined, to, broaden, cosmetic, surgery, and, other, forms, of, elective, surgery, from, 1917, to, 1932, the, american, red, cross, moved, into, europe, with, a, battery, of, long, term, child, health, projects, it, built, and, operated, hospitals, and, clinics, and, organized, antituberculosis, and, antityphus, campaigns, a, high, priority, involved, child, health, programs, such, as, clinics, better, baby, shows, playgrounds, fresh, air, camps, and, courses, for, women, on, infant, hygiene, hundreds, of, u, s, doctors, nurses, and, welfare, professionals, administered, these, programs, which, aimed, to, reform, the, health, of, european, youth, and, to, reshape, european, public, health, and, welfare, along, american, lines, the, advances, in, medicine, made, a, dramatic, difference, for, allied, troops, while, the, germans, and, especially, the, japanese, and, chinese, suffered, from, a, severe, lack, of, newer, medicines, techniques, and, facilities, harrison, finds, that, the, chances, of, recovery, for, a, badly, wounded, british, infantryman, were, as, much, as, 25, times, better, than, in, the, first, world, war, the, reason, was, that, during, the, second, world, war, alexis, carrel, and, henry, dakin, developed, the, carrel, dakin, method, of, treating, wounds, with, an, irrigation, dakin, s, solution, a, germicide, which, helped, prevent, gangrene, the, war, spurred, the, usage, of, roentgen, s, x, ray, and, the, electrocardiograph, for, the, monitoring, of, internal, bodily, functions, this, was, followed, in, the, inter, war, period, by, the, development, of, the, first, anti, bacterial, agents, such, as, the, sulpha, antibiotics, nazi, and, japanese, medical, research, unethical, human, subject, research, and, killing, of, patients, with, disabilities, peaked, during, the, nazi, era, with, nazi, human, experimentation, and, aktion, t4, during, the, holocaust, as, the, most, significant, examples, many, of, the, details, of, these, and, related, events, were, the, focus, of, the, doctors, trial, subsequently, principles, of, medical, ethics, such, as, the, nuremberg, code, were, introduced, to, prevent, a, recurrence, of, such, atrocities, after, 1937, the, japanese, army, established, programs, of, biological, warfare, in, china, in, unit, 731, japanese, doctors, and, research, scientists, conducted, large, numbers, of, vivisections, and, experiments, on, human, beings, mostly, chinese, victims, the, world, health, organization, was, founded, in, 1948, as, a, united, nations, agency, to, improve, global, health, in, most, of, the, world, life, expectancy, has, improved, since, then, and, was, about, 67, years, as, of, 2010, and, well, above, 80, years, in, some, countries, eradication, of, infectious, diseases, is, an, international, effort, and, several, new, vaccines, have, been, developed, during, the, post, war, years, against, infections, such, as, measles, mumps, several, strains, of, influenza, and, human, papilloma, virus, the, long, known, vaccine, against, smallpox, finally, eradicated, the, disease, in, the, 1970s, and, rinderpest, was, wiped, out, in, 2011, eradication, of, polio, is, underway, tissue, culture, is, important, for, development, of, vaccines, though, the, early, success, of, antiviral, vaccines, and, antibacterial, drugs, antiviral, drugs, were, not, introduced, until, the, 1970s, through, the, who, the, international, community, has, developed, a, response, protocol, against, epidemics, displayed, during, the, sars, epidemic, in, 2003, the, influenza, a, virus, subtype, h5n1, from, 2004, the, ebola, virus, epidemic, in, west, africa, and, onwards, the, discovery, of, penicillin, in, the, 20th, century, by, alexander, fleming, provided, a, vital, line, of, defence, against, bacterical, infections, that, without, them, often, cause, patients, to, suffer, prelonged, recovery, periods, and, highly, increased, chances, of, death, its, discovery, and, application, within, medicine, allowed, previously, impossible, treatments, to, take, place, including, cancer, treatments, organ, transplants, to, open, heart, surgery, throughout, the, 20th, century, though, their, overprescribed, use, to, humans, as, well, as, to, animals, that, need, them, due, to, the, conditions, of, intensive, animal, farming, has, led, to, the, development, of, antibiotic, resistant, bacteria, the, early, 21st, century, facilitated, by, extensive, global, connections, international, travel, and, unprecedented, human, disruption, of, ecological, systems, has, been, defined, by, a, number, of, noval, as,

gave, rise, to, a, number, of, lessons, learnt, from, viral, infection, control, including, more, effective, isolation, room, protocols, to, better, hand, washing, techniques, for, medical, staff, a, mutated, strain, of, sars, would, go, on, to, develop, into, covid, 19, causing, the, future, covid, 19, pandemic, a, significant, influenza, strain, h1n1, caused, a, further, pandemic, between, 2009, and, 2010, known, as, swine, flu, due, to, its, indirect, source, from, pigs, it, went, on, to, infect, over, 700, million, people, the, continuing, hiv, pandemic, starting, in, 1981, has, infected,
