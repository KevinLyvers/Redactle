in, historical, contexts, new, imperialism, characterizes, a, period, of, colonial, expansion, by, european, powers, the, united, states, and, japan, during, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, the, period, featured, an, unprecedented, pursuit, of, overseas, territorial, acquisitions, at, the, time, states, focused, on, building, their, empires, with, new, technological, advances, and, developments, expanding, their, territory, through, conquest, and, exploiting, the, resources, of, the, subjugated, countries, during, the, era, of, new, imperialism, the, european, powers, and, japan, individually, conquered, almost, all, of, africa, and, parts, of, asia, the, new, wave, of, imperialism, reflected, ongoing, rivalries, among, the, great, powers, the, economic, desire, for, new, resources, and, markets, and, a, civilizing, mission, ethos, many, of, the, colonies, established, during, this, era, gained, independence, during, the, era, of, decolonization, that, followed, world, war, ii, the, qualifier, new, is, used, to, differentiate, modern, imperialism, from, earlier, imperial, activity, such, as, the, formation, of, ancient, empires, and, the, first, wave, of, european, colonization, the, american, revolutionary, war, 1775, 1783, and, the, collapse, of, the, spanish, empire, in, latin, america, in, the, 1820s, ended, the, first, era, of, european, imperialism, especially, in, great, britain, these, revolutions, helped, show, the, deficiencies, of, mercantilism, the, doctrine, of, economic, competition, for, finite, wealth, which, had, supported, earlier, imperial, expansion, in, 1846, the, corn, laws, were, repealed, and, manufacturers, grew, as, the, regulations, enforced, by, the, corn, laws, had, slowed, their, businesses, with, the, repeal, in, place, the, manufacturers, were, able, to, trade, more, freely, thus, britain, began, to, adopt, the, concept, of, free, trade, during, this, period, between, the, 1815, congress, of, vienna, after, the, defeat, of, napoleonic, france, and, imperial, germany, s, victory, in, the, franco, prussian, war, in, 1871, great, britain, reaped, the, benefits, of, being, europe, s, dominant, military, and, economic, power, as, the, workshop, of, the, world, britain, could, produce, finished, goods, so, efficiently, that, they, could, usually, undersell, comparable, locally, manufactured, goods, in, foreign, markets, supplying, a, large, share, of, the, manufactured, goods, consumed, by, such, nations, as, the, german, states, france, belgium, and, the, united, states, the, erosion, of, british, hegemony, after, the, franco, prussian, war, in, which, a, coalition, of, german, states, led, by, prussia, soundly, defeated, the, second, french, empire, was, occasioned, by, changes, in, the, european, and, world, economies, and, in, the, continental, balance, of, power, following, the, breakdown, of, the, concert, of, europe, established, by, the, congress, of, vienna, the, establishment, of, nation, states, in, germany, and, italy, resolved, territorial, issues, that, had, kept, potential, rivals, embroiled, in, internal, affairs, at, the, heart, of, europe, to, britain, s, advantage, the, years, from, 1871, to, 1914, would, be, marked, by, an, extremely, unstable, peace, france, s, determination, to, recover, alsace, lorraine, annexed, by, germany, as, a, result, of, the, franco, prussian, war, and, germany, s, mounting, imperialist, ambitions, would, keep, the, two, nations, constantly, poised, for, conflict, this, competition, was, sharpened, by, the, long, depression, of, 1873, 1896, a, prolonged, period, of, price, deflation, punctuated, by, severe, business, downturns, which, put, pressure, on, governments, to, promote, home, industry, leading, to, the, widespread, abandonment, of, free, trade, among, europe, s, powers, in, germany, from, 1879, and, in, france, from, 1881, the, berlin, conference, of, 1884, 1885, sought, to, destroy, the, competition, between, the, powers, by, defining, effective, occupation, as, the, criterion, for, international, recognition, of, a, territory, claim, specifically, in, africa, the, imposition, of, direct, rule, in, terms, of, effective, occupation, necessitated, routine, recourse, to, armed, force, against, indigenous, states, and, peoples, uprisings, against, imperial, rule, were, put, down, ruthlessly, most, brutally, in, the, herero, wars, in, german, south, west, africa, from, 1904, to, 1907, and, the, maji, maji, rebellion, in, german, east, africa, from, 1905, to, 1907, one, of, the, goals, of, the, conference, was, to, reach, agreements, over, trade, navigation, and, boundaries, of, central, africa, however, of, all, of, the, 15, nations, in, attendance, of, the, berlin, conference, none, of, the, countries, represented, were, african, the, main, dominating, powers, of, the, conference, were, france, germany, britain, and, portugal, they, remapped, africa, without, considering, the, cultural, and, linguistic, borders, that, were, already, established, at, the, end, of, the, conference, africa, was, divided, into, 50, different, colonies, the, attendants, established, who, was, in, control, of, each, of, these, newly, divided, colonies, they, also, planned, noncommittally, to, end, the, slave, trade, in, africa, in, britain, the, age, of, new, imperialism, marked, a, time, for, significant, economic, changes, because, the, country, was, the, first, to, industrialize, britain, was, technologically, ahead, of, many, other, countries, throughout, the, majority, of, the, nineteenth, century, by, the, end, of, the, nineteenth, century, however, other, countries, chiefly, germany, and, the, united, states, began, to, challenge, britain, s, technological, and, economic, power, after, several, decades, of, monopoly, the, country, was, battling, to, maintain, a, dominant, economic, position, while, other, powers, became, more, involved, in, international, markets, in, 1870, britain, contained, 31, 8, of, the, world, s, manufacturing, capacity, while, the, united, states, contained, 23, 3, and, germany, contained, 13, 2, by, 1910, britain, s, manufacturing, capacity, had, dropped, to, 14, 7, while, that, of, the, united, states, had, risen, to, 35, 3, and, that, of, germany, to, 15, 9, as, countries, like, germany, and, america, became, more, economically, successful, they, began, to, become, more, involved, with, imperialism, resulting, in, the, british, struggling, to, maintain, the, volume, of, british, trade, and, investment, overseas, britain, further, faced, strained, international, relations, with, three, expansionist, powers, japan, germany, and, italy, during, the, early, twentieth, century, before, 1939, these, three, powers, never, directly, threatened, britain, itself, but, the, dangers, to, the, empire, were, clear, by, the, 1930s, britain, was, worried, that, japan, would, threaten, its, holdings, in, the, far, east, as, well, as, territories, in, india, australia, and, new, zealand, italy, held, an, interest, in, north, africa, which, threatened, british, egypt, and, german, dominance, of, the, european, continent, held, some, danger, for, britain, s, security, britain, worried, that, the, expansionist, powers, would, cause, the, breakdown, of, international, stability, as, such, british, foreign, policy, attempted, to, protect, the, stability, in, a, rapidly, changing, world, with, its, stability, and, holdings, threatened, britain, decided, to, adopt, a, policy, of, concession, rather, than, resistance, a, policy, that, became, known, as, appeasement, in, britain, the, era, of, new, imperialism, affected, public, attitudes, toward, the, idea, of, imperialism, itself, most, of, the, public, believed, that, if, imperialism, was, going, to, exist, it, was, best, if, britain, was, the, driving, force, behind, it, the, same, people, further, thought, that, british, imperialism, was, a, force, for, good, in, the, world, in, 1940, the, fabian, colonial, research, bureau, argued, that, africa, could, be, developed, both, economically, and, socially, but, until, this, development, could, happen, africa, was, best, off, remaining, with, the, british, empire, rudyard, kipling, s, 1891, poem, the, english, flag, contains, the, stanza, winds, of, the,

knew, more, about, british, national, identity, than, the, ones, whose, entire, lives, were, spent, solely, in, the, imperial, metropolis, while, there, were, pockets, of, anti, imperialist, opposition, in, britain, in, the, late, nineteenth, and, early, twentieth, centuries, resistance, to, imperialism, was, nearly, nonexistent, in, the, country, as, a, whole, in, many, ways, this, new, form, of, imperialism, formed, a, part, of, the, british, identity, until, the, end, of, the, era, of, new, imperialism, with, the, second, world, war, while, social, darwinism, became, popular,

military, spending, expanded, usually, leading, to, an, imperial, overreach, and, imperialism, created, clients, of, ruling, elites, abroad, that, were, brutal, and, corrupt, consolidating, power, through, imperial, rents, and, impeding, social, change, and, economic, development, that, ran, against, their, ambitions, furthermore, nation, building, oftentimes, created, cultural, sentiments, of, racism, and, xenophobia, many, of, europe, s, major, elites, also, found, advantages, in, formal, overseas, expansion, large, financial, and, industrial, monopolies, wanted, imperial, support, to, protect, their, overseas, investments, against, competition, and, domestic, political, tensions, abroad, bureaucrats, sought, government, offices, military, officers, desired, promotion, and, the, traditional, but, waning, landed, gentries, sought, increased, profits, for, their, investments, formal, titles, and, high, office, such, special, interests, have, perpetuated, empire, building, throughout, history, the, enforcement, of, mercantilist, policies, played, a, role, in, sustaining, new, imperialism, this, restricted, colonies, to, trade, only, with, respective, metropoles, which, strengthened, home, country, economies, at, first, through, growing, chartered, companies, and, later, through, imperial, states, themselves, new, imperialism, shifted, towards, the, use, of, free, trade, the, reduction, of, market, restrictions, and, tariffs, and, the, coercion, of, foreign, markets, to, open, up, often, through, gunboat, diplomacy, or, concerted, interventionism, such, as, police, actions, observing, the, rise, of, trade, unionism, socialism, and, other, protest, movements, during, an, era, of, mass, society, both, in, europe, and, later, in, north, america, elites, sought, to, use, imperial, jingoism, to, co, opt, the, support, of, part, of, the, industrial, working, class, the, new, mass, media, promoted, jingoism, in, the, spanish, american, war, 1898, the, second, boer, war, 1899, 1902, and, the, boxer, rebellion, 1900, the, left, wing, german, historian, hans, ulrich, wehler, has, defined, social, imperialism, as, the, diversions, outwards, of, internal, tensions, and, forces, of, change, in, order, to, preserve, the, social, and, political, status, quo, and, as, a, defensive, ideology, to, counter, the, disruptive, effects, of, industrialization, on, the, social, and, economic, structure, of, germany, in, wehler, s, opinion, social, imperialism, was, a, device, that, allowed, the, german, government, to, distract, public, attention, from, domestic, problems, and, preserve, the, existing, social, and, political, order, the, dominant, elites, used, social, imperialism, as, the, glue, to, hold, together, a, fractured, society, and, to, maintain, popular, support, for, the, social, status, quo, according, to, wehler, german, colonial, policy, in, the, 1880s, was, the, first, example, of, social, imperialism, in, action, and, was, followed, up, by, the, 1897, tirpitz, plan, for, expanding, the, german, navy, in, this, point, of, view, groups, such, as, the, colonial, society, and, the, navy, league, are, seen, as, instruments, for, the, government, to, mobilize, public, support, the, demands, for, annexing, most, of, europe, and, africa, in, world, war, i, are, seen, by, wehler, as, the, pinnacle, of, social, imperialism, in, the, 17th, century, the, british, businessmen, arrived, in, india, and, after, taking, a, small, portion, of, land, formed, the, east, india, company, the, british, east, india, company, annexed, most, of, the, subcontinent, of, india, starting, with, bengal, in, 1757, and, ending, with, punjab, in, 1849, many, princely, states, remained, independent, this, was, aided, by, a, power, vacuum, formed, by, the, collapse, of, the, mughal, empire, in, india, and, the, death, of, mughal, emperor, aurangzeb, and, increased, british, forces, in, india, because, of, colonial, conflicts, with, france, the, invention, of, clipper, ships, in, the, early, 1800s, cut, the, trip, to, india, from, europe, in, half, from, 6, months, to, 3, months, the, british, also, laid, cables, on, the, floor, of, the, ocean, allowing, telegrams, to, be, sent, from, india, and, china, in, 1818, the, british, controlled, most, of, the, indian, subcontinent, and, began, imposing, their, ideas, and, ways, on, its, residents, including, different, succession, laws, that, allowed, the, british, to, take, over, a, state, with, no, successor, and, gain, its, land, and, armies, new, taxes, and, monopolistic, control, of, industry, the, british, also, collaborated, with, indian, officials, to, increase, their, influence, in, the, region, some, hindu, and, muslim, sepoys, rebelled, in, 1857, resulting, in, the, indian, rebellion, after, this, revolt, was, suppressed, by, the, british, india, came, under, the, direct, control, of, the, british, crown, after, the, british, had, gained, more, control, over, india, they, began, changing, around, the, financial, state, of, india, previously, europe, had, to, pay, for, indian, textiles, and, spices, in, bullion, with, political, control, britain, directed, farmers, to, grow, cash, crops, for, the, company, for, exports, to, europe, while, india, became, a, market, for, textiles, from, britain, in, addition, the, british, collected, huge, revenues, from, land, rent, and, taxes, on, its, acquired, monopoly, on, salt, production, indian, weavers, were, replaced, by, new, spinning, and, weaving, machines, and, indian, food, crops, were, replaced, by, cash, crops, like, cotton, and, tea, the, british, also, began, connecting, indian, cities, by, railroad, and, telegraph, to, make, travel, and, communication, easier, as, well, as, building, an, irrigation, system, for, increasing, agricultural, production, when, western, education, was, introduced, in, india, indians, were, quite, influenced, by, it, but, the, inequalities, between, the, british, ideals, of, governance, and, their, treatment, of, indians, became, clear, in, response, to, this, discriminatory, treatment, a, group, of, educated, indians, established, the, indian, national, congress, demanding, equal, treatment, and, self, governance, john, robert, seeley, a, cambridge, professor, of, history, said, our, acquisition, of, india, was, made, blindly, nothing, great, that, has, ever, been, done, by, englishmen, was, done, so, unintentionally, or, accidentally, as, the, conquest, of, india, according, to, him, the, political, control, of, india, was, not, a, conquest, in, the, usual, sense, because, it, was, not, an, act, of, a, state, the, new, administrative, arrangement, crowned, with, queen, victoria, s, proclamation, as, empress, of, india, in, 1876, effectively, replaced, the, rule, of, a, monopolistic, enterprise, with, that, of, a, trained, civil, service, headed, by, graduates, of, britain, s, top, universities, the, administration, retained, and, increased, the, monopolies, held, by, the, company, the, india, salt, act, of, 1882, included, regulations, enforcing, a, government, monopoly, on, the, collection, and, manufacture, of, salt, in, 1923, a, bill, was, passed, doubling, the, salt, tax, after, taking, control, of, much, of, india, the, british, expanded, further, into, burma, malaya, singapore, and, borneo, with, these, colonies, becoming, further, sources, of, trade, and, raw, materials, for, british, goods, france, annexed, all, of, vietnam, and, cambodia, in, the, 1880s, in, the, following, decade, france, completed, its, indochinese, empire, with, the, annexation, of, laos, leaving, the, kingdom, of, siam, now, thailand, with, an, uneasy, independence, as, a, neutral, buffer, between, british, and, french, ruled, lands, the, united, states, laid, claim, to, the, philippines, and, after, the, spanish, american, war, took, control, of, the, archipelago, as, one, of, its, overseas, possessions, formal, colonization, of, the, dutch, east, indies, now, indonesia, commenced, at, the, dawn, of, the, 19th, century, when, the, dutch, state, took, possession, of, all, dutch, east, india, company, voc, assets, before, that, time, the, voc, merchants, were, in, principle, just, another, trading, power, among, many, establishing, trading, posts, and, settlements, colonies, in, strategic, places, around, the, archipelago, the, dutch, gradually, extended, their, sovereignty, over, most, of, the, islands, in, the, east, indies, dutch, expansion, paused, for, several, years, during, an, interregnum, of, british, rule, between, 1806, and, 1816, when, the, dutch, republic, was, occupied, by, the, french, forces, of, napoleon, the, dutch, government, in, exile, in, england, ceded, rule, of, all, its, colonies, to, great, britain, however, jan, willem, janssens, the, governor, of, the, dutch, east, indies, at, the, time, fought, the, british, before, surrendering, the, colony, he, was, eventually, replaced, by, stamford, raffles, the, dutch, east, indies, became, the, prize, possession, of, the, dutch, empire, it, was, not, the, typical, settler, colony, founded, through, massive, emigration, from, the, mother, countries, such, as, the, usa, or, australia, and, hardly, involved, displacement, of, the, indigenous, islanders, with, a, notable, and, dramatic, exception, in, the, island, of, banda, during, the, voc, era, neither, was, it, a, plantation, colony, built, on, the, import, of, slaves, such, as, haiti, or, jamaica, or, a, pure, trade, post, colony, such, as, singapore, or, macau, it, was, more, of, an, expansion, of, the, existing, chain, of, voc, trading, posts, instead, of, mass, emigration, from, the, homeland, the, sizeable, indigenous, populations, were, controlled, through, effective, political, manipulation, supported, by, military, force, the, servitude, of, the, indigenous, masses, was, enabled, through, a, structure, of, indirect, governance, keeping, existing, indigenous, rulers, in, place, this, strategy, was, already, established, by, the, voc, which, independently, acted, as, a, semi, sovereign, state, within, the, dutch, state, using, the, indo, eurasian, population, as, an, intermediary, buffer, in, 1869, british, anthropologist, alfred, russel, wallace, described, the, colonial, governing, structure, in, his, book, the, malay, archipelago, the, mode, of, government, now, adopted, in, java, is, to, retain, the, whole, series, of, native, rulers, from, the, village, chief, up, to, princes, who, under, the, name, of, regents, are, the, heads, of, districts, about, the, size, of, a, small, english, county, with, each, regent, is, placed, a, dutch, resident, or, assistant, resident, who, is, considered, to, be, his, elder, brother, and, whose, orders, take, the, form, of, recommendations, which, are, however, implicitly, obeyed, along, with, each, assistant, resident, is, a, controller, a, kind, of, inspector, of, all, the, lower, native, rulers, who, periodically, visits, every, village, in, the, district, examines, the, proceedings, of, the, native, courts, hears, complaints, against, the, head, men, or, other, native, chiefs, and, superintends, the, government, plantations, in, 1839, china, found, itself, fighting, the, first, opium, war, with, great, britain, after, the, governor, general, of, hunan, and, hubei, lin, zexu, seized, the, illegally, traded, opium, china, was, defeated, and, in, 1842, agreed, to, the, provisions, of, the, treaty, of, nanking, hong, kong, island, was, ceded, to, britain, and, certain, ports, including, shanghai, and, guangzhou, were, opened, to, british, trade, and, residence, in, 1856, the, second, opium, war, broke, out, the, chinese, were, again, defeated, and, forced, to, the, terms, of, the, 1858, treaty, of, tientsin, and, the, 1860, convention, of, peking, the, treaty, opened, new, ports, to, trade, and, allowed, foreigners, to, travel, in, the, interior, missionaries, gained, the, right, to, propagate, christianity, another, means, of, western, penetration, the, united, states, and, russia, obtained, the, same, prerogatives, in, separate, treaties, towards, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, china, appeared, on, the, way, to, territorial, dismemberment, and, economic, vassalage, the, fate, of, india, s, rulers, that, had, played, out, much, earlier, several, provisions, of, these, treaties, caused, long, standing, bitterness, and, humiliation, among, the, chinese, extraterritoriality, meaning, that, in, a, dispute, with, a, chinese, person, a, westerner, had, the, right, to, be, tried, in, a, court, under, the, laws, of, his, own, country, customs, regulation, and, the, right, to, station, foreign, warships, in, chinese, waters, in, 1904, the, british, invaded, tibet, a, pre, emptive, strike, against, russian, intrigues, and, secret, meetings, between, the,

invasion, of, the, crown, colony, of, india, though, russia, badly, defeated, by, japan, in, the, russo, japanese, war, and, weakened, by, internal, revolution, could, not, realistically, afford, a, military, conflict, against, britain, china, under, the, qing, dynasty, however, was, another, matter, natural, disasters, famine, and, internal, rebellions, had, enfeebled, china, in, the, late, qing, in, the, late, 19th, century, japan, and, the, great, powers, easily, carved, out, trade, and, territorial, concessions, these, were, humiliating, submissions, for, the, once, powerful, china, still, the, central, lesson, of, the, war, with, japan, was, not, lost, on, the, russian, general, staff, an, asian, country, using, western, technology, and, industrial, production, methods, could, defeat, a, great, european, power, jane, e, elliott, criticized, the, allegation, that, china, refused, to, modernize, or, was, unable, to, defeat, western, armies, as, simplistic, noting, that, china, embarked, on, a, massive, military, modernization, in, the, late, 1800s, after, several, defeats, buying, weapons, from, western, countries, and, manufacturing, their, own, at, arsenals, such, as, the, hanyang, arsenal, during, the, boxer, rebellion, in, addition, elliott, questioned, the, claim, that, chinese, society, was, traumatized, by, the, western, victories, as, many, chinese, peasants, 90, of, the, population, at, that, time, living, outside, the, concessions, continued, about, their, daily, lives, uninterrupted, and, without, any, feeling, of, humiliation, the, british, observer, demetrius, charles, de, kavanagh, boulger, suggested, a, british, chinese, alliance, to, check, russian, expansion, in, central, asia, during, the, ili, crisis, when, qing, china, threatened, to, go, to, war, against, russia, over, the, russian, occupation, of, ili, the, british, officer, charles, george, gordon, was, sent, to, china, by, britain, to, advise, china, on, military, options, against, russia, should, a, potential, war, break, out, between, china, and, russia, the, russians, observed, the, chinese, building, up, their, arsenal, of, modern, weapons, during, the, ili, crisis, the, chinese, bought, thousands, of, rifles, from, germany, in, 1880, massive, amounts, of, military, equipment, and, rifles, were, shipped, via, boats, to, china, from, antwerp, as, china, purchased, torpedoes, artillery, and, 260, 260, modern, rifles, from, europe, the, russian, military, observer, d, v, putiatia, visited, china, in, 1888, and, found, that, in, northeastern, china, manchuria, along, the, chinese, russian, border, the, chinese, soldiers, were, potentially, able, to, become, adept, at, european, tactics, under, certain, circumstances, and, the, chinese, soldiers, were, armed, with, modern, weapons, like, krupp, artillery, winchester, carbines, and, mauser, rifles, compared, to, russian, controlled, areas, more, benefits, were, given, to, the, muslim, kirghiz, on, the, chinese, controlled, areas, russian, settlers, fought, against, the, muslim, nomadic, kirghiz, which, led, the, russians, to, believe, that, the, kirghiz, would, be, a, liability, in, any, conflict, against, china, the, muslim, kirghiz, were, sure, that, in, an, upcoming, war, that, china, would, defeat, russia, the, qing, dynasty, forced, russia, to, hand, over, disputed, territory, in, ili, in, the, treaty, of, saint, petersburg, 1881, in, what, was, widely, seen, by, the, west, as, a, diplomatic, victory, for, the, qing, russia, acknowledged, that, qing, china, potentially, posed, a, serious, military, threat, mass, media, in, the, west, during, this, era, portrayed, china, as, a, rising, military, power, due, to, its, modernization, programs, and, as, major, threat, to, the, western, world, invoking, fears, that, china, would, successfully, conquer, western, colonies, like, australia, russian, sinologists, the, russian, media, threat, of, internal, rebellion, the, pariah, status, inflicted, by, the, congress, of, berlin, and, the, negative, state, of, the, russian, economy, all, led, russia, to, concede, and, negotiate, with, china, in, st, petersburg, and, return, most, of, ili, to, china, historians, have, judged, the, qing, dynasty, s, vulnerability, and, weakness, to, foreign, imperialism, in, the, 19th, century, to, be, based, mainly, on, its, maritime, naval, weakness, while, it, achieved, military, success, against, westerners, on, land, the, historian, edward, l, dreyer, said, that, china, s, nineteenth, century, humiliations, were, strongly, related, to, her, weakness, and, failure, at, sea, at, the, start, of, the, opium, war, china, had, no, unified, navy, and, no, sense, of, how, vulnerable, she, was, to, attack, from, the, sea, british, forces, sailed, and, steamed, wherever, they, wanted, to, go, in, the, arrow, war, 1856, 60, the, chinese, had, no, way, to, prevent, the, anglo, french, expedition, of, 1860, from, sailing, into, the, gulf, of, zhili, and, landing, as, near, as, possible, to, beijing, meanwhile, new, but, not, exactly, modern, chinese, armies, suppressed, the, midcentury, rebellions, bluffed, russia, into, a, peaceful, settlement, of, disputed, frontiers, in, central, asia, and, defeated, the, french, forces, on, land, in, the, sino, french, war, 1884, 1885, but, the, defeat, of, the, fleet, and, the, resulting, threat, to, steamship, traffic, to, taiwan, forced, china, to, conclude, peace, on, unfavorable, terms, the, british, and, russian, consuls, schemed, and, plotted, against, each, other, at, kashgar, in, 1906, tsar, nicholas, ii, sent, a, secret, agent, to, china, to, collect, intelligence, on, the, reform, and, modernization, of, the, qing, dynasty, the, task, was, given, to, carl, gustaf, emil, mannerheim, at, the, time, a, colonel, in, the, russian, army, who, travelled, to, china, with, french, sinologist, paul, pelliot, mannerheim, was, disguised, as, an, ethnographic, collector, using, a, finnish, passport, finland, was, at, the, time, a, grand, duchy, for, two, years, mannerheim, proceeded, through, xinjiang, gansu, shaanxi, henan, shanxi, and, inner, mongolia, to, beijing, at, the, sacred, buddhist, mountain, of, wutai, shan, he, even, met, the, 13th, dalai, lama, however, while, mannerheim, was, in, china, in, 1907, russia, and, britain, brokered, the, anglo, russian, agreement, ending, the, classical, period, of, the, great, game, the, correspondent, douglas, story, observed, chinese, troops, in, 1907, and, praised, their, abilities, and, military, skill, the, rise, of, japan, as, an, imperial, power, after, the, meiji, restoration, led, to, further, subjugation, of, china, in, a, dispute, over, regional, suzerainty, war, broke, out, between, china, and, japan, resulting, in, another, humiliating, defeat, for, the, chinese, by, the, treaty, of, shimonoseki, in, 1895, china, was, forced, to, recognize, korea, s, exit, from, the, imperial, chinese, tributary, system, leading, to, the, proclamation, of, the, korean, empire, and, the, island, of, taiwan, was, ceded, to, japan, in, 1897, taking, advantage, of, the, murder, of, two, missionaries, germany, demanded, and, was, given, a, set, of, mining, and, railroad, rights, around, jiaozhou, bay, in, shandong, province, in, 1898, russia, obtained, access, to, dairen, and, port, arthur, and, the, right, to, build, a, railroad, across, manchuria, thereby, achieving, complete, domination, over, a, large, portion, of, northeast, china, the, united, kingdom, france, and, japan, also, received, a, number, of, concessions, later, that, year, the, erosion, of, chinese, sovereignty, contributed, to, a, spectacular, anti, foreign, outbreak, in, june, 1900, when, the, boxers, properly, the, society, of, the, righteous, and, harmonious, fists, attacked, foreign, legations, in, beijing, this, boxer, rebellion, provoked, a, rare, display, of, unity, among, the, colonial, powers, who, formed, the, eight, nation, alliance, troops, landed, at, tianjin, and, marched, on, the, capital, which, they, took, on, 14, august, the, foreign, soldiers, then, looted, and, occupied, beijing, for, several, months, german, forces, were, particularly, severe, in, exacting, revenge, for, the, killing, of, their, ambassador, while, russia, tightened, its, hold, on, manchuria, in, the, northeast, until, its, crushing, defeat, by, japan, in, the, russo, japanese, war, of, 1904, 1905, extraterritorial, jurisdiction, was, abandoned, by, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, in, 1943, mainland, chinese, historians, refer, to, this, period, as, the, century, of, humiliation, the, great, game, also, called, the, tournament, of, shadows, russian, turniry, teney, in, russia, was, the, strategic, economic, and, political, rivalry, emanating, to, conflict, between, the, british, empire, and, the, russian, empire, for, supremacy, in, central, asia, at, the, expense, of, afghanistan, persia, and, the, central, asian, khanates, emirates, the, classic, great, game, period, is, generally, regarded, as, running, approximately, from, the, russo, persian, treaty, of, 1813, to, the, anglo, russian, convention, of, 1907, in, which, nations, like, emirate, of, bukhara, fell, a, less, intensive, phase, followed, the, bolshevik, revolution, of, 1917, causing, some, trouble, with, persia, and, afghanistan, until, the, mid, 1920s, in, the, post, second, world, war, post, colonial, period, the, term, has, informally, continued, in, its, usage, to, describe, the, geopolitical, machinations, of, the, great, powers, and, regional, powers, as, they, vie, for, geopolitical, power, as, well, as, influence, in, the, area, especially, in, afghanistan, and, iran, persia, between, 1850, and, 1914, britain, brought, nearly, 30, of, africa, s, population, under, its, control, to, 15, for, france, 9, for, germany, 7, for, belgium, and, 1, for, italy, nigeria, alone, contributed, 15, million, subjects, to, britain, more, than, in, the, whole, of, french, west, africa, or, the, entire, german, colonial, empire, the, only, nations, that, were, not, under, european, control, by, 1914, were, liberia, and, ethiopia, britain, s, formal, occupation, of, egypt, in, 1882, triggered, by, concern, over, the, suez, canal, contributed, to, a, preoccupation, over, securing, control, of, the, nile, river, leading, to, the, conquest, of, neighboring, sudan, in, 1896, 1898, which, in, turn, led, to, confrontation, with, a, french, military, expedition, at, fashoda, in, september, 1898, in, 1899, britain, set, out, to, complete, its, takeover, of, the, future, south, africa, which, it, had, begun, in, 1814, with, the, annexation, of, the, cape, colony, by, invading, the, gold, rich, afrikaner, republics, of, transvaal, and, the, neighboring, orange, free, state, the, chartered, british, south, africa, company, had, already, seized, the, land, to, the, north, renamed, rhodesia, after, its, head, the, cape, tycoon, cecil, rhodes, british, gains, in, southern, and, east, africa, prompted, rhodes, and, alfred, milner, britain, s, high, commissioner, in, south, africa, to, urge, a, cape, to, cairo, empire, linked, by, rail, the, strategically, important, canal, would, be, firmly, connected, to, the, mineral, rich, south, though, belgian, control, of, the, congo, free, state, and, german, control, of, german, east, africa, prevented, such, an, outcome, until, the, end, of, world, war, i, when, great, britain, acquired, the, latter, territory, britain, s, quest, for, southern, africa, and, its, diamonds, led, to, social, complications, and, fallouts, that, lasted, for, years, to, work, for, their, prosperous, company, british, businessmen, hired, both, white, and, black, south, africans, but, when, it, came, to, jobs, the, white, south, africans, received, the, higher, paid, and, less, dangerous, ones, leaving, the, black, south, africans, to, risk, their, lives, in, the, mines, for, limited, pay, this, process, of, separating, the, two, groups, of, south, africans, whites, and, blacks, was, the, beginning, of, segregation, between, the, two, that, lasted, until, 1990, paradoxically, the, united, kingdom, a, staunch, advocate, of, free, trade, emerged, in, 1913, with, not, only, the, largest, overseas, empire, thanks, to, its, long, standing, presence, in, india, but, also, the, greatest, gains, in, the, conquest, of, africa, reflecting, its, advantageous, position, at, its, inception, until, 1876, belgium, had, no, colonial, presence, in, africa, it, was, then, that, its, king, leopold, ii, created, the, international, african, society, operating, under, the, pretense, of, an, international, scientific, and, philanthropic, association, it, was, actually, a, private, holding, company, owned, by, leopold, henry, morton, stanley, was, employed, to, explore, and, colonize, the, congo, river, basin, area, of, equatorial, africa, in, order, to, capitalize, on, the, plentiful, resources, such, as, ivory, rubber, diamonds, and, metals, up, until, this, point, africa, was, known, as, the, dark, continent, because, of, the, difficulties, europeans, had, with, exploration, over, the, next, few, years, stanley, overpowered, and, made, treaties, with, over, 450, native, tribes, acquiring, him, over, 2, 340, 000, square, kilometres, 905, 000, sq, mi, of, land, nearly, 67, times, the, size, of, belgium, neither, the, belgian, government, nor, the, belgian, people, had, any, interest, in, imperialism, at, the, time, and, the, land, came, to, be, personally, owned, by, king, leopold, ii, at, the, berlin, conference, in, 1884, he, was, allowed, to, have, land, named, the, congo, free, state, the, other, european, countries, at, the, conference, allowed, this, to, happen, on, the, conditions, that, he, suppress, the, east, african, slave, trade, promote, humanitarian, policies, guarantee, free, trade, and, encourage, missions, to, christianize, the, people, of, the, congo, however, leopold, ii, s, primary, focus, was, to, make, a, large, profit, on, the, natural, resources, particularly, ivory, and, rubber, in, order, to, make, this, profit, he, passed, several, cruel, decrees, that, can, be, considered, to, be, genocide, he, forced, the, natives, to, supply, him, with, rubber, and, ivory, without, any, sort, of, payment, in, return, their, wives, and, children, were, held, hostage, until, the, workers, returned, with, enough, rubber, or, ivory, to, fill, their, quota, and, if, they, could, not, their, family, would, be, killed, when, villages, refused, they, were, burned, down, the, children, of, the, village, were, murdered, and, the, men, had, their, hands, cut, off, these, policies, led, to, uprisings, but, they, were, feeble, compared, to, european, military, and, technological, might, and, were, consequently, crushed, the, forced, labor, was, opposed, in, other, ways, fleeing, into, the, forests, to, seek, refuge, or, setting, the, rubber, forests, on, fire, preventing, the, europeans, from, harvesting, the, rubber, no, population, figures, exist, from, before, or, after, the, period, but, it, is, estimated, that, as, many, as, 10, million, people, died, from, violence, famine, and, disease, however, some, sources, point, to, a, total, population, of, 16, million, people, king, leopold, ii, profited, from, the, enterprise, with, a, 700, profit, ratio, for, the, rubber, he, took, from, congo, and, exported, he, used, propaganda, to, keep, the, other, european, nations, at, bay, for, he, broke, almost, all, of, the, parts, of, the, agreement, he, made, at, the, berlin, conference, for, example, he, had, some, congolese, pygmies, sing, and, dance, at, the, 1897, world, fair, in, belgium, showing, how, he, was, supposedly, civilizing, and, educating, the, natives, of, the, congo, under, significant, international, pressure, the, belgian, government, annexed, the, territory, in, 1908, and, renamed, it, the, belgian, congo, removing, it, from, the, personal, power, of, the, king, of, all, the, colonies, that, were, conquered, during, the, wave, of, new, imperialism, the, human, rights, abuses, of, the, congo, free, state, were, considered, the, worst, france, gained, a, leading, position, as, an, imperial, power, in, the, pacific, after, making, tahiti, and, new, caledonia, protectorates, in, 1842, and, 1853, respectively, tahiti, was, later, annexed, entirely, into, the, french, colonial, empire, in, 1880, along, with, the, rest, of, the, society, islands, the, united, states, made, several, territorial, gains, during, this, period, particularly, with, the, annexation, of, hawaii, and, acquisition, of, most, of, spain, s, colonial, outposts, following, the, 1898, spanish, american, war, as, well, as, the, partition, of, the, samoan, islands, into, american, samoa, and, german, samoa, by, 1900, nearly, all, islands, in, the, pacific, ocean, were, under, the, control, of, britain, france, the, united, states, germany, japan, mexico, ecuador, and, chile, chile, s, interest, in, expanding, into, the, islands, of, the, pacific, ocean, dates, to, the, presidency, of, jos, joaqu, n, prieto, 1831, 1841, and, the, ideology, of, diego, portales, who, considered, that, chile, s, expansion, into, polynesia, was, a, natural, consequence, of, its, maritime, destiny, nonetheless, the, first, stage, of, the, country, s, expansionism, into, the, pacific, began, only, a, decade, later, in, 1851, when, in, response, to, an, american, incursion, into, the, juan, fern, ndez, islands, chile, s, government, formally, organized, the, islands, into, a, subdelegation, of, valpara, so, that, same, year, chile, s, economic, interest, in, the, pacific, were, renewed, after, its, merchant, fleet, briefly, succeeded, in, creating, an, agricultural, goods, exchange, market, that, connected, the, californian, port, of, san, francisco, with, australia, by, 1861, chile, had, established, a, lucrative, enterprise, across, the, pacific, its, national, currency, abundantly, circulating, throughout, polynesia, and, its, merchants, trading, in, the, markets, of, tahiti, new, zealand, tasmania, and, shanghai, negotiations, were, also, made, with, the, spanish, philippines, and, altercations, reportedly, occurred, between, chilean, and, american, whalers, in, the, sea, of, japan, this, period, ended, as, a, result, of, the, chilean, merchant, fleet, s, destruction, by, spanish, forces, in, 1866, during, the, chincha, islands, war, chile, s, polynesian, aspirations, would, again, be, awakened, in, the, aftermath, of, the, country, s, decisive, victory, against, peru, in, the, war, of, the, pacific, which, left, the, chilean, fleet, as, the, dominant, maritime, force, in, the, pacific, coast, of, the, americas, valpara, so, had, also, become, the, most, important, port, in, the, pacific, coast, of, south, america, providing, chilean, merchants, with, the, capacity, to, find, markets, in, the, pacific, for, its, new, mineral, wealth, acquired, from, the, atacama, during, this, period, the, chilean, intellectual, and, politician, benjam, n, vicu, a, mackenna, who, served, as, senator, in, the, national, congress, from, 1876, to, 1885, was, an, influential, voice, in, favor, of, chilean, expansionism, into, the, pacific, he, considered, that, spain, s, discoveries, in, the, pacific, had, been, stolen, by, the, british, and, envisioned, that, chile, s, duty, was, to, create, an, empire, in, the, pacific, that, would, reach, asia, in, the, context, of, this, imperialist, fervor, is, that, in, 1886, captain, policarpo, toro, of, the, chilean, navy, proposed, to, his, superiors, the, annexation, of, easter, island, a, proposal, which, was, supported, by, president, jos, manuel, balmaceda, because, of, the, island, s, apparent, strategic, location, and, economic, value, after, toro, transferred, the, rights, to, the, island, s, sheep, ranching, operations, from, tahiti, based, businesses, to, the, chilean, based, williamson, balfour, company, in, 1887, easter, island, s, annexation, process, was, culminated, with, the, signing, of, the, agreement, of, wills, between, rapa, nui, chieftains, and, toro, in, name, of, the, chilean, government, in, 1888, by, occupying, easter, island, chile, joined, the, imperial, nations, 53, the, extension, of, european, control, over, africa, and, asia, added, a, further, dimension, to, the, rivalry, and, mutual, suspicion, which, characterized, international, diplomacy, in, the, decades, preceding, world, war, i, france, s, seizure, of, tunisia, in, 1881, initiated, fifteen, years, of, tension, with, italy, which, had, hoped, to, take, the, country, retaliating, by, allying, with, germany, and, waging, a, decade, long, tariff, war, with, france, britain, s, takeover, of, egypt, a, year, later, caused, a, marked, cooling, of, its, relations, with, france, the, most, striking, conflicts, of, the, era, were, the, spanish, american, war, of, 1898, and, the, russo, japanese, war, of, 1904, 05, each, signaling, the, advent, of, a, new, imperial, great, power, the, united, states, and, japan, respectively, the, fashoda, incident, of, 1898, represented, the, worst, anglo, french, crisis, in, decades, but, france, s, buckling, in, the, face, of, british, demands, foreshadowed, improved, relations, as, the, two, countries, set, about, resolving, their, overseas, claims, british, policy, in, south, africa, and, german, actions, in, the, far, east, contributed, to, dramatic, policy, shifts, which, in, the, 1900s, aligned, hitherto, isolationist, britain, first, with, japan, as, an, ally, and, then, with, france, and, russia, in, the, looser, triple, entente, german, efforts, to, break, the, entente, by, challenging, french, hegemony, in, morocco, resulted, in, the, tangier, crisis, of, 1905, and, the, agadir, crisis, of, 1911, adding, to, tension, and, anti, german, sentiment, in, the, years, preceding, world, war, i, in, the, pacific, conflicts, between, germany, the, united, states, and, the, united, kingdom, contributed, to, the, first, and, second, samoan, civil, war, another, crisis, occurred, in, 1902, 03, when, there, was, a, stand, off, between, venezuela, backed, by, argentina, the, united, states, see, drago, doctrine, and, monroe, doctrine, and, a, coalition, of, european, countries, one, of, the, biggest, motivations, behind, new, imperialism, was, the, idea, of, humanitarianism, and, civilizing, the, lower, class, people, in, africa, and, in, other, undeveloped, places, this, was, a, religious, motive, for, many, christian, missionaries, in, an, attempt, to, save, the, souls, of, the, uncivilized, people, and, based, on, the, idea, that, european, christians, were, morally, superior, most, of, the, missionaries, that, supported, imperialism, did, so, because, they, felt, the, only, true, religion, was, their, own, similarly, french, spanish, and, italian, catholic, missionaries, opposed, the, protestant, british, german, and, american, missionaries, at, times, however, imperialism, did, help, the, people, of, the, colonies, because, the, missionaries, ended, up, stopping, slavery, in, some, areas, therefore, europeans, claimed, that, they, were, only, there, because, they, wanted, to, protect, the, weaker, tribal, groups, they, conquered, the, missionaries, and, other, leaders, suggested, that, they, should, stop, such, savage, practices, as, cannibalism, idolatry, and, child, marriage, this, humanitarian, ideal, was, described, in, poems, such, as, the, white, man, s, burden, and, other, literature, in, many, instances, the, humanitarianism, was, sincere, but, often, with, misguided, choices, although, some, imperialists, were, trying, to, be, sincere, with, the, notion, of, humanitarianism, at, times, their, choices, might, not, have, been, best, for, the, areas, they, were, conquering, and, the, natives, living, there, as, a, result, some, modern, historical, revisionists, have, suggested, that, new, imperialism, was, driven, more, by, the, idea, of, racial, and, cultural, supremacism, and, that, claims, of, humanitarianism, were, either, insincere, or, used, as, pretexts, for, territorial, expansion, the, dutch, ethical, policy, was, the, dominant, reformist, and, liberal, political, character, of, colonial, policy, in, the, dutch, east, indies, during, the, 20th, century, in, 1901, the, dutch, queen, wilhelmina, announced, that, the, netherlands, accepted, an, ethical, responsibility, for, the, welfare, of, their, colonial, subjects, despite, clearly, being, discriminatory, towards, the, oppressed, colonised, peoples, this, announcement, was, a, sharp, contrast, with, the, former, official, doctrine, that, indonesia, was, mainly, a, wingewest, region, for, making, profit, it, marked, the, start, of, modern, development, policy, implemented, and, practised, by, alexander, willem, frederik, idenburg, whereas, other, colonial, powers, usually, talked, of, a, civilizing, mission, which, mainly, involved, spreading, their, culture, to, colonized, peoples, and, expanding, their, culture, the, dutch, ethical, policy, dutch, ethische, politiek, emphasised, improvement, in, material, living, conditions, the, policy, suffered, however, from, serious, underfunding, inflated, expectations, and, lack, of, acceptance, in, the, dutch, colonial, establishment, and, it, had, largely, ceased, to, exist, by, the, onset, of, the, great, depression, in, 1929, it, did, however, create, an, educated, indigenous, elite, able, to, articulate, and, eventually, establish, independence, from, the, netherlands, the, accumulation, theory, adopted, by, karl, kautsky, john, a, hobson, and, popularized, by, vladimir, lenin, centered, on, the, accumulation, of, surplus, capital, during, and, after, the, industrial, revolution, restricted, opportunities, at, home, the, argument, goes, drove, financial, interests, to, seek, more, profitable, investments, in, less, developed, lands, with, lower, labor, costs, unexploited, raw, materials, and, little, competition, hobson, s, analysis, fails, to, explain, colonial, expansion, on, the, part, of, less, industrialized, nations, with, little, surplus, capital, such, as, italy, or, the, great, powers, of, the, next, century, the, united, states, and, russia, which, were, in, fact, net, borrowers, of, foreign, capital, also, military, and, bureaucratic, costs, of, occupation, frequently, exceeded, financial, returns, in, africa, exclusive, of, what, would, become, the, union, of, south, africa, in, 1909, the, amount, of, capital, investment, by, europeans, was, relatively, small, before, and, after, the, 1880s, and, the, companies, involved, in, tropical, african, commerce, exerted, limited, political, influence, the, world, systems, theory, approach, of, immanuel, wallerstein, sees, imperialism, as, part, of, a, general, gradual, extension, of, capital, investment, from, the, core, of, the, industrial, countries, to, a, less, developed, periphery, protectionism, and, formal, empire, were, the, major, tools, of, semi, peripheral, newly, industrialized, states, such, as, germany, seeking, to, usurp, britain, s, position, at, the, core, of, the, global, capitalist, system, echoing, wallerstein, s, global, perspective, to, an, extent, imperial, historian, bernard, porter, views, britain, s, adoption, of, formal, imperialism, as, a, symptom, and, an, effect, of, her, relative, decline, in, the, world, and, not, of, strength, stuck, with, outmoded, physical, plants, and, outmoded, forms, of, business, organization, now, felt, the, less, favorable, effects, of, being, the, first, to, modernize
