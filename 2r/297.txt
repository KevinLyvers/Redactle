kievan, rus, in, the, late, 12th, century, centered, in, vladimir, on, klyazma, with, time, the, principality, grew, into, a, grand, principality, divided, into, several, smaller, principalities, after, being, conquered, by, the, mongol, empire, the, principality, became, a, self, governed, state, headed, by, its, own, nobility, a, governorship, of, the, principality, however, was, prescribed, by, a, jarlig, declaration, by, the, khan, issued, from, the, golden, horde, to, a, rurikid, sovereign, the, early, rostov, principality, occupied, a, vast, but, sparsely, populated, territory, in, the, northeast, of, kievan, rus, approximately, bounded, by, the, volga, oka, and, northern, dvina, rivers, according, to, the, archaeologist, andrei, leontiev, who, specializes, in, the, history, of, the, region, the, rostov, land, until, the, 10th, century, was, already, under, the, control, of, rostov, city, while, sarskoye, gorodishche, was, a, tribal, centre, of, the, native, merya, people, in, the, 10th, century, an, eparchy, was, established, in, rostov, at, that, time, rostov, was, the, major, centre, of, the, eastern, orthodox, christianity, in, the, region, dominated, mostly, by, paganism, until, the, 11th, century, rostov, was, often, associated, with, novgorod, the, first, known, administrator, in, the, rostov, region, mentioned, in, the, primary, chronicle, sub, anno, 988, was, yaroslav, the, wise, appointed, by, his, father, volodimer, i, of, kiev, in, 1024, there, was, reportedly, a, famine, in, the, area, and, a, revolt, stoked, up, by, pagan, sorcerers, was, suppressed, by, yaroslav, personally, upon, his, death, in, 1054, vsevolod, yaroslavich, received, the, principality, of, pereyaslavl, including, the, lands, of, rostov, little, is, known, about, the, region, until, the, 1090s, except, that, the, town, of, yaroslavl, had, been, founded, upon, the, upper, volga, by, 1071, and, that, vladimir, monomakh, ordered, a, church, to, be, built, in, rostov, at, the, 1097, council, of, liubech, monomakh, became, prince, of, pereyaslavl, including, rostov, for, which, he, made, an, appanage, for, his, sons, from, that, time, onwards, the, rostov, region, was, a, point, of, contention, between, the, monomakhovichi, of, pereyaslavl, and, the, sviatoslavichi, of, murom, control, of, the, upper, volga, river, was, particularly, important, as, it, was, the, primary, route, for, trade, between, volga, bulgaria, to, the, east, and, veliky, novgorod, to, the, west, intercepting, that, commercial, shipping, for, their, own, profit, was, tempting, for, the, monomakhovichi, but, also, risky, as, it, provoked, hostilities, with, both, the, bulgars, and, novgorodians, it, seems, that, by, the, year, 1108, monomakh, s, sixth, son, yuri, dolgorukiy, who, resided, in, the, town, of, suzdal, was, the, prince, of, rostov, in, the, same, year, he, supposedly, founded, the, fortified, outpost, of, vladimir, volodimer, on, the, klyazma, to, control, that, river, and, defend, against, raids, of, the, volga, bulgars, who, had, attacked, in, 1107, in, 1120, yuri, conducted, a, military, campaign, against, bolghar, territory, during, the, 11th, and, 12th, centuries, when, southern, parts, of, rus, were, systematically, raided, by, turkic, nomads, their, inhabitants, began, to, migrate, northward, in, the, formerly, wooded, areas, known, as, zalesye, many, new, settlements, were, established, the, foundations, of, pereslavl, kostroma, dmitrov, moscow, yuriev, polsky, uglich, tver, dubna, and, many, others, were, assigned, either, by, chronicle, or, popular, legend, to, g, whose, sobriquet, the, long, armed, alludes, to, his, dexterity, in, manipulating, the, politics, of, far, away, kiev, sometime, in, 1108, monomakh, strengthened, and, rebuilt, the, town, of, vladimir, on, the, klyazma, river, 31, km, south, of, suzdal, during, the, rule, of, yuri, the, principality, gained, military, strength, and, in, the, suzdal, ryazan, war, of, 1146, it, conquered, the, ryazan, principality, later, in, the, 1150s, yuri, occupied, kiev, a, couple, of, times, as, well, from, that, time, the, lands, of, the, northeastern, rus, played, an, important, role, in, the, politics, of, kievan, rus, yuri, s, son, andrey, bogolyubsky, significantly, increased, vladimir, s, power, at, the, expense, of, the, nearby, princely, states, which, he, treated, with, contempt, when, grand, prince, rostislav, i, of, kiev, died, in, 1167, a, succession, crisis, broke, out, in, which, andrey, argued, that, according, to, the, emergent, tradition, of, the, principality, of, pereyaslavl, being, the, domain, of, the, crown, prince, of, kiev, his, brother, gleb, ought, to, be, enthroned, after, burning, down, kiev, then, the, metropolitan, seat, of, rus, in, 1169, he, enthroned, his, younger, brother, for, andrey, his, capital, of, vladimir, was, a, far, greater, concern, as, he, embellished, it, with, white, stone, churches, and, monasteries, prince, andrey, was, murdered, by, boyars, in, his, suburban, residence, at, bogolyubovo, in, 1174, after, a, brief, interregnum, andrey, s, brother, vsevolod, iii, secured, the, throne, he, continued, most, of, his, brother, s, policies, and, once, again, subjugated, kiev, in, 1203, vsevolod, s, chief, enemies, however, were, the, southern, ryazan, principality, which, appeared, to, stir, discord, in, the, princely, family, and, the, mighty, turkic, state, of, volga, bulgaria, which, bordered, vladimir, suzdal, to, the, east, after, several, military, campaigns, ryazan, was, burnt, to, the, ground, and, the, bulgars, were, forced, to, pay, tribute, vsevolod, s, death, in, 1212, precipitated, a, serious, dynastic, conflict, his, eldest, son, konstantin, gained, the, support, of, powerful, rostovan, boyars, and, mstislav, the, bold, of, kiev, and, expelled, the, lawful, heir, his, brother, george, from, vladimir, to, rostov, george, managed, to, return, to, the, capital, six, years, later, upon, konstantin, s, death, george, proved, to, be, a, shrewd, ruler, who, decisively, defeated, volga, bulgaria, and, installed, his, brother, yaroslav, in, novgorod, his, reign, however, ended, when, the, mongol, hordes, under, batu, khan, took, and, burnt, vladimir, in, 1238, thereupon, they, proceeded, to, devastate, other, major, cities, of, vladimir, suzdal, during, the, mongol, invasion, of, kievan, rus, while, heavy, tribute, payments, and, the, initial, mongol, invasions, did, manage, to, cause, much, destruction, to, vladimir, suzdal, rule, under, the, mongols, also, brought, wealth, to, the, region, as, vladimir, was, able, to, access, the, mongol, s, lucrative, patronage, of, oriental, trade, none, of, the, cities, of, the, principality, managed, to, regain, the, power, of, kievan, rus, after, the, mongol, invasion, vladimir, became, a, vassal, of, the, mongol, empire, later, succeeded, by, the, golden, horde, with, the, grand, prince, appointed, by, the, great, khan, even, the, popular, alexander, nevsky, of, pereslavl, had, to, go, to, the, khan, s, capital, in, karakorum, to, be, installed, as, the, grand, prince, in, vladimir, as, many, factions, strove, for, power, the, principality, rapidly, disintegrated, into, eleven, tiny, states, moscow, tver, pereslavl, rostov, yaroslavl, uglich, belozersk, kostroma, nizhny, novgorod, starodub, upon, klyazma, and, yuriev, polsky, all, of, them, nominally, acknowledged, the, suzerainty, of, the, grand, prince, of, vladimir, but, his, effective, authority, became, progressively, weaker, by, the, end, of, the, century, only, three, cities, moscow, tver, and, nizhny, novgorod, still, contended, for, the, title, of, grand, prince, of, vladimir, once, installed, however, they, chose, to, remain, in, their, own, cities, rather, than, move, to, vladimir, the, grand, duchy, of, moscow, gradually, came, to, eclipse, its, rivals, when, the, metropolitan, of, kievan, rus, moved, his, chair, from, vladimir, to, moscow, in, 1325, it, became, clear, that, moscow, had, effectively, succeeded, vladimir, as, the, chief, centre, of, power, in, the, north, east, remnant, of, kievan, rus, as, part, of, the, christian, world, rus, principalities, gained, a, wide, range, of, opportunities, for, developing, their, political, and, cultural, ties, not, only, with, byzantium, but, with, the, european, countries, as, well, by, the, end, of, the, eleventh, century, rus, gradually, fell, under, the, influence, of, roman, architecture, whitestone, cathedrals, decorated, with, sculpture, appeared, in, the, principality, of, vladimir, suzdal, due, to, andrey, bogolyubsky, s, invitation, of, architects, from, all, over, the, world, these, cathedrals, however, are, not, identical, to, the, roman, edifices, of, catholic, europe, and, represent, a, synthesis, of, the, byzantine, cruciform, plan, and, cupolas, with, roman, whitestone, construction, and, decorative, technique, this, mixture, of, greek, and, western, european, traditions, was, possible, only, in, kievan, rus, one, of, its, results, was, a, famous, architectural, masterpiece, of, vladimir, the, church, of, pokrova, na, nerli, a, symbol, of, cultural, originality, of, suzdalia, in, the, early, middle, ages, rus, principalities, were, similar, to, other, european, countries, culturally, and, in, historical, development, later, on, however, the, rus, polities, and, europe, began, diverging, due, to, a, number, of, factors, the, east, west, schism, of, 1054, was, one, of, the, reasons, for, this, barely, noticeable, in, the, eleventh, century, it, became, very, obvious, two, centuries, later, during, the, resistance, of, the, citizens, of, novgorod, to, the, teutonic, knights, also, by, the, middle, of, the, twelfth, century, the, dominating, influence, of, the, kievan, rus, some, historians, do, not, consider, it, possible, to, even, call, it, a, state, in, the, modern, sense, of, the, word, began, to, wane, the, famous, theotokos, of, vladimir, an, icon, of, the, virgin, mary, was, moved, to, vladimir, from, this, time, on, almost, every, principality, began, forming, its, own, architectural, and, art, schools, the, invasion, of, batu, khan, and, subsequent, domination, of, rus, lands, by, the, golden, horde, was, also, a, turning, point, in, the, history, of, russian, culture, and, statehood, mongol, rule, imposed, its, principles, of, state, on, the, northeastern, rus, principalities, which, were, very, different, from, those, of, western, europe, in, particular, russia, adopted, a, principle, of, universal, subordination, and, undivided, authority, rus, was, only, able, to, recover, from, the, consequences, of, the, mongol, invasion, by, the, late, thirteenth, century, the, first, areas, to, recover, were, novgorod, and, pskov, which, had, been, spared, the, tatar, raids, these, city, states, with, parliamentarian, rule, created, an, original, kind, of, culture, under, some, influence, from, their, western, baltic, neighbours, in, the, early, fourteenth, century, leadership, in, the, northeastern, lands, was, transferred, from, the, principality, of, vladimir, to, moscow, which, in, turn, would, fight, for, leadership, against, tver, for, another, century, moscow, was, a, part, of, the, vladimir, lands, and, functioned, as, one, of, the, border, fortresses, of, north, eastern, rus, in, 1324, metropolitan, peter, left, vladimir, and, settled, down, in, moscow, thus, transferring, the, residence, of, the,
