with, the, bolsheviks, controlling, the, city, for, five, days, until, the, alekseev, organization, supported, kaledin, in, recapturing, the, city, according, to, peter, kenez, the, operation, begun, on, december, 9, can, be, regarded, as, the, beginning, of, the, civil, war, having, stated, in, the, november, 1917, declaration, of, rights, of, nations, of, russia, that, any, nation, under, imperial, russian, rule, should, be, immediately, given, the, power, of, self, determination, the, bolsheviks, had, begun, to, usurp, the, power, of, the, provisional, government, in, the, territories, of, central, asia, soon, after, the, establishment, of, the, turkestan, committee, in, tashkent, in, april, 1917, the, provisional, government, set, up, the, committee, which, was, mostly, made, up, of, former, tsarist, officials, the, bolsheviks, attempted, to, take, control, of, the, committee, in, tashkent, on, 12, september, 1917, but, it, was, unsuccessful, and, many, leaders, were, arrested, however, because, the, committee, lacked, representation, of, the, native, population, and, poor, russian, settlers, they, had, to, release, the, bolshevik, prisoners, almost, immediately, because, of, a, public, outcry, and, a, successful, takeover, of, that, government, body, took, place, two, months, later, in, november, the, leagues, of, mohammedam, working, people, which, russian, settlers, and, natives, who, had, been, sent, to, work, behind, the, lines, for, the, tsarist, government, in, 1916, formed, in, march, 1917, had, led, numerous, strikes, in, the, industrial, centers, throughout, september, 1917, however, after, the, bolshevik, destruction, of, the, provisional, government, in, tashkent, muslim, elites, formed, an, autonomous, government, in, turkestan, commonly, called, the, kokand, autonomy, or, simply, kokand, the, white, russians, supported, that, government, body, which, lasted, several, months, because, of, bolshevik, troop, isolation, from, moscow, in, january, 1918, the, soviet, forces, under, lt, col, muravyov, invaded, ukraine, and, invested, kiev, where, the, central, council, of, ukraine, held, power, with, the, help, of, the, kiev, arsenal, uprising, the, bolsheviks, captured, the, city, on, 26, january, the, bolsheviks, decided, to, immediately, make, peace, with, the, central, powers, as, they, had, promised, the, russian, people, before, the, revolution, vladimir, lenin, s, political, enemies, attributed, that, decision, to, his, sponsorship, by, the, foreign, office, of, wilhelm, ii, german, emperor, offered, to, lenin, in, hope, that, with, a, revolution, russia, would, withdraw, from, world, war, i, that, suspicion, was, bolstered, by, the, german, foreign, ministry, s, sponsorship, of, lenin, s, return, to, petrograd, however, after, the, military, fiasco, of, the, summer, offensive, june, 1917, by, the, russian, provisional, government, had, devastated, the, structure, of, the, russian, army, it, became, crucial, that, lenin, realize, the, promised, peace, even, before, the, failed, summer, offensive, the, russian, population, was, very, skeptical, about, the, continuation, of, the, war, western, socialists, had, promptly, arrived, from, france, and, from, the, uk, to, convince, the, russians, to, continue, the, fight, but, could, not, change, the, new, pacifist, mood, of, russia, on, 16, december, 1917, an, armistice, was, signed, between, russia, and, the, central, powers, in, brest, litovsk, and, peace, talks, began, as, a, condition, for, peace, the, proposed, treaty, by, the, central, powers, conceded, huge, portions, of, the, former, russian, empire, to, the, german, empire, and, the, ottoman, empire, greatly, upsetting, nationalists, and, conservatives, leon, trotsky, representing, the, bolsheviks, refused, at, first, to, sign, the, treaty, while, continuing, to, observe, a, unilateral, cease, fire, following, the, policy, of, no, war, no, peace, therefore, on, 18, february, 1918, the, germans, began, operation, faustschlag, on, the, eastern, front, encountering, virtually, no, resistance, in, a, campaign, that, lasted, 11, days, signing, a, formal, peace, treaty, was, the, only, option, in, the, eyes, of, the, bolsheviks, because, the, russian, army, was, demobilized, and, the, newly, formed, red, guard, could, not, stop, the, advance, they, also, understood, that, the, impending, counter, revolutionary, resistance, was, more, dangerous, than, the, concessions, of, the, treaty, which, lenin, viewed, as, temporary, in, the, light, of, aspirations, for, a, world, revolution, the, soviets, acceded, to, a, peace, treaty, and, the, formal, agreement, the, treaty, of, brest, litovsk, was, ratified, on, 3, march, the, soviets, viewed, the, treaty, as, merely, a, necessary, and, expedient, means, to, end, the, war, in, ukraine, the, german, austrian, operation, faustschlag, had, by, april, 1918, removed, the, bolsheviks, from, ukraine, the, german, and, austro, hungarian, victories, in, ukraine, were, caused, by, the, apathy, of, the, locals, and, the, inferior, fighting, skills, of, bolsheviks, troops, to, their, austro, hungarian, and, german, counterparts, under, soviet, pressure, the, volunteer, army, embarked, on, the, epic, ice, march, from, yekaterinodar, to, kuban, on, 22, february, 1918, where, they,

ruler, and, commander, in, chief, of, all, land, and, naval, forces, of, russia, by, mid, december, 1918, the, white, armies, had, to, leave, ufa, but, they, balanced, that, failure, with, a, successful, drive, towards, perm, which, they, took, on, 24, december, in, the, red, army, the, concept, of, barrier, troops, first, arose, in, august, 1918, with, the, formation, of, the, zagraditelnye, otriady, translated, as, blocking, troops, or, anti, retreat, detachments, russian, the, barrier, troops, comprised, personnel, drawn, from, the, cheka, punitive, detachments, or, from, regular, red, army, infantry, regiments, the, first, use, of, the, barrier, troops, by, the, red, army, occurred, in, the, late, summer, and, fall, of, 1918, in, the, eastern, front, during, the, russian, civil, war, when, leon, trotsky, authorized, mikhail, tukhachevsky, the, commander, of, the, 1st, army, to, station, blocking, detachments, behind, unreliable, red, army, infantry, regiments, in, the, 1st, red, army, with, orders, to, shoot, if, front, line, troops, either, deserted, or, retreated, without, permission, in, december, 1918, trotsky, ordered, that, detachments, of, additional, barrier, troops, be, raised, for, attachment, to, each, infantry, formation, in, the, red, army, on, december, 18, he, cabled, how, do, things, stand, with, the, blocking, units, as, far, as, i, am, aware, they, have, not, been, included, in, our, establishment, and, it, appears, they, have, no, personnel, it, is, absolutely, essential, that, we, have, at, least, an, embryonic, network, of, blocking, units, and, that, we, work, out, a, procedure, for, bringing, them, up, to, strength, and, deploying, them, in, 1919, 616, hardcore, deserters, of, the, total, 837, 000, draft, dodgers, and, deserters, were, executed, following, trotsky, s, draconian, measures, according, to, figes, a, majority, of, deserters, most, registered, as, weak, willed, were, handed, back, to, the, military, authorities, and, formed, into, units, for, transfer, to, one, of, the, rear, armies, or, directly, to, the, front, even, those, registered, as, malicious, deserters, were, returned, to, the, ranks, when, the, demand, for, reinforcements, became, desperate, forges, also, noted, that, the, red, army, instituted, amnesty, weeks, to, prohibit, punitive, measures, against, desertion, which, encouraged, the, voluntary, return, of, 98, 000, 132, 000, deserters, to, the, army, the, barrier, troops, were, also, used, to, enforce, bolshevik, control, over, food, supplies, in, areas, controlled, by, the, red, army, as, part, of, lenin, s, war, communism, policies, a, role, which, soon, earned, them, the, hatred, of, the, russian, civilian, population, these, policies, in, part, led, to, the, russian, famine, of, 1921, 1922, which, killed, about, five, million, people, however, the, famine, was, preceded, by, bad, harvests, harsh, winter, drought, especially, in, the, volga, valley, which, was, exacerbated, by, a, range, of, factors, including, the, war, the, presence, of, the, white, army, and, the, methods, of, war, communism, the, outbreaks, of, diseases, such, as, cholera, and, typhus, were, also, contributing, factors, to, the, famine, casualties, in, february, 1918, the, red, army, overthrew, the, white, russian, supported, kokand, autonomy, of, turkestan, although, that, move, seemed, to, solidify, bolshevik, power, in, central, asia, more, troubles, soon, arose, for, the, red, army, as, the, allied, forces, began, to, intervene, british, support, of, the, white, army, provided, the, greatest, threat, to, the, red, army, in, central, asia, during, 1918, britain, sent, three, prominent, military, leaders, to, the, area, one, was, lieutenant,

khiva, the, third, was, major, general, dunsterville, who, was, driven, out, by, the, bolsheviks, of, central, asia, only, a, month, after, his, arrival, in, august, 1918, despite, setbacks, as, a, result, of, british, invasions, during, 1918, the, bolsheviks, continued, to, make, progress, in, bringing, the, central, asian, population, under, their, influence, the, first, regional, congress, of, the, russian, communist, party, convened, in, the, city, of, tashkent, in, june, 1918, in, order, to, build, support, for, a, local, bolshevik, party, on, 6, july, 1918, two, left, socialist,

revolutionists, was, over, the, left, socialist, revolutionaries, of, course, were, no, longer, tolerated, as, members, of, the, soviets, from, this, time, the, soviet, regime, became, a, pure, and, undiluted, dictatorship, of, the, communist, party, similarly, boris, savinkov, s, surprise, attacks, were, suppressed, with, many, of, the, conspirators, being, executed, as, mass, red, terror,

estonian, 3rd, division, defeated, the, baltic, germans, a, month, later, aiding, the, establishment, of, the, republic, of, latvia, that, rendered, possible, another, threat, to, the, red, army, from, general, yudenich, who, had, spent, the, summer, organizing, the, northwestern, army, in, estonia, with, local, and, british, support, in, october, 1919, he, tried, to, capture, petrograd, in, a, sudden, assault, with, a, force, of, around, 20, 000, men, the, attack, was, well, executed, using, night, attacks, and, lightning, cavalry, maneuvers, to, turn, the, flanks, of, the, defending, red, army, yudenich, also, had, six, british, tanks, which, caused, panic, whenever, they, appeared, the, allies, gave, large, quantities, of, aid, to, yudenich, but, he, complained, of, receiving, insufficient, support, by, 19, october, yudenich, s, troops, had, reached, the, outskirts, of, the, city, some, members, of, the, bolshevik, central, committee, in, moscow, were, willing, to, give, up, petrograd, but, trotsky, refused, to, accept, the, loss, of, the, city, and, personally, organized, its, defenses, trotsky, himself, declared, it, is, impossible, for, a, little, army, of, 15, 000, ex, officers, to, master, a, working, class, capital, of, 700, 000, inhabitants, he, settled, on, a, strategy, of, urban, defense, proclaiming, that, the, city, would, defend, itself, on, its, own, ground, and, that, the, white, army, would, be, lost, in, a, labyrinth, of, fortified, streets, and, there, meet, its, grave, trotsky, armed, all, available, workers, men, and, women, and, ordered, the, transfer, of, military, forces, from, moscow, within, a, few, weeks, the, red, army, defending, petrograd, had, tripled, in, size, and, outnumbered, yudenich, three, to, one, yudenich,
