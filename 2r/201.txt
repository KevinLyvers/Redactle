migrated, to, what, is, today, north, caucasus, while, some, continued, on, to, europe, and, later, north, africa, they, are, generally, regarded, as, part, of, the, sarmatians, and, possibly, related, to, the, massagetae, modern, historians, have, connected, the, alans, with, the, central, asian, yancai, of, chinese, sources, and, with, the, aorsi, of, roman, sources, having, migrated, westwards, and, becoming, dominant, among, the, sarmatians, on, the, pontic, caspian, steppe, the, alans, are, mentioned, by, roman, sources, in, the, 1st, century, ce, at, that, time, they, had, settled, the, region, north, of, the, black, sea, and, frequently, raided, the, parthian, empire, and, the, south, caucasus, provinces, of, the, roman, empire, from, 215, to, 250, ce, the, goths, broke, their, power, on, the, pontic, steppe, thereby, assimilating, a, sizeable, portion, of, the, associated, alans, upon, the, hunnic, defeat, of, the, goths, on, the, pontic, steppe, around, 375, ce, many, of, the, alans, migrated, westwards, along, with, various, germanic, tribes, they, crossed, the, rhine, in, 406, ce, along, with, the, vandals, and, suebi, settling, in, orl, ans, and, valence, around, 409, ce, they, joined, the, vandals, and, suebi, in, crossing, the, pyrenees, into, the, iberian, peninsula, settling, in, lusitania, and, hispania, carthaginensis, the, iberian, alans, soundly, defeated, by, the, visigoths, in, 418, ce, subsequently, surrendered, their, authority, to, the, hasdingi, vandals, in, 428, ce, the, vandals, and, alans, crossed, the, strait, of, gibraltar, into, north, africa, where, they, founded, a, kingdom, which, lasted, until, its, conquest, by, forces, of, the, byzantine, emperor, justinian, i, in, 534, eventually, in, the, 9th, century, those, alans, who, remained, under, hunnic, rule, established, the, regionally, powerful, kingdom, of, alania, it, survived, until, the, mongol, invasions, of, the, 13th, century, ce, various, scholars, regard, these, alans, as, the, ancestors, of, the, modern, ossetians, the, alans, spoke, an, eastern, iranian, language, which, derived, from, scytho, sarmatian, and, which, in, turn, evolved, into, the, modern, ossetian, language, the, name, alan, represents, an, eastern, iranian, dialectal, form, of, old, iranian, term, aryan, and, so, is, cognate, with, the, name, of, the, country, r, n, from, the, gen, plur, ary, n, m, the, alans, were, documented, by, foreign, observers, from, the, 1st, century, ce, onward, under, similar, names, latin, al, n, greek, alanoi, chinese,

language, as, allon, the, ethnonym, al, n, is, a, dialectal, variant, of, the, old, iranian, ary, na, itself, derived, from, the, root, arya, meaning, aryan, the, common, self, designation, of, indo, iranian, peoples, it, probably, came, in, use, in, the, early, history, of, the, alans, for, the, purpose, of, uniting, a, heterogeneous, group, of, tribes, through, the, invocation, of, a, common, ancestral, aryan, origin, like, the, name, of, iran, ary, n, m, the, adjective, ary, na, is, related, to, airyan, m, wa, stretch, of, the, aryas, the, mythical, homeland, of, the, early, iranians, mentioned, in, the, avesta, some, other, ethnonyms, also, bear, the, name, of, the, alans, the, rhoxol, ni, bright, alans, an, offshoot, of, the, alans, whose, name, may, be, linked, to, religious, practices, and, the, alanorsoi, white, alans, perhaps, a, conglomerate, of, alans, and, aorsi, the, personal, names, alan, and, alain, from, latin, alanus, may, have, been, introduced, by, alan, settlers, to, western, europe, during, the, first, millennium, ce, the, alans, were, also, known, over, the, course, of, their, history, by, another, group, of, related, names, including, the, variations, asi, as, and, os, romanian, iasi, or, olani, bulgarian, uzi, hungarian, j, sz, russian, jasy, georgian, osi, it, is, this, name, at, the, root, of, the, modern, ossetian, the, alans, were, formed, out, of, the, merger, of, the, massagetae, a, central, asian, iranian, nomadic, people, with, some, old, tribal, groups, related, to, the, asii, who, had, invaded, bactria, in, the, 2nd, century, bce, the, alans, were, pushed, west, by, the, kangju, people, known, to, graeco, roman, authors, as, the, iax, rtai, in, greek, and, the, iaxartae, in, latin, the, latter, of, whom, were, living, in, the, syr, darya, basin, from, where, they, expanded, their, rule, from, fergana, to, the, aral, sea, region, the, first, mentions, of, names, that, historians, link, with, the, alani, appear, at, almost, the, same, time, in, texts, from, the, mediterranean, middle, east, and, china, in, the, 1st, century, ce, the, alans, migrated, westwards, from, central, asia, achieving, a, dominant, position, among, the, sarmatians, living, between, the, don, river, and, the, caspian, sea, the, alans, are, mentioned, in, the, vologases, inscription, which, reads, that, vologases, i, the, parthian, king, between, around, 45, and, 78, ce, in, the, 11th, year, of, his, reign, 62, ce, battled, kuluk, king, of, the, alani, the, 1st, century, ce, jewish, historian, josephus, supplements, this, inscription, josephus, reports, in, the, jewish, wars, book, 7, ch, 7, 4, how, alans, whom, he, calls, a, scythian, tribe, living, near, the, sea, of, azov, crossed, the, iron, gates, for, plunder, 72, ce, and, defeated, the, armies, of, pacorus, king, of, media, and, tiridates, king, of, armenia, two, brothers, of, vologeses, i, for, whom, the, above, mentioned, inscription, was, made, now, there, was, a, nation, of, the, alans, which, we, have, formerly, mentioned, somewhere, as, being, scythians, and, living, around, tanais, and, lake, maeotis, this, nation, about, this, time, laid, a, design, of, falling, upon, media, and, the, parts, beyond, it, in, order, to, plunder, them, with, which, intention, they, treated, with, the, king, of, hyrcania, for, he, was, master, of, that, passage, which, king, alexander, shut, up, with, iron, gates, this, king, gave, them, leave, to, come, through, them, so, they, came, in, great, multitudes, and, fell, upon, the, medes, unexpectedly, and, plundered, their, country, which, they, found, full, of, people, and, replenished, with, abundance, of, cattle, while, nobody, dared, make, any, resistance, against, them, for, pacorus, the, king, of, the, country, had, fled, away, for, fear, into, places, where, they, could, not, easily, come, at, him, and, had, yielded, up, everything, he, had, to, them, and, had, only, saved, his, wife, and, his, concubines, from, them, and, that, with, difficulty, also, after, they, had, been, made, captives, by, giving, a, hundred, talents, for, their, ransom, these, alans, therefore, plundered, the, country, without, opposition, and, with, great, ease, and, proceeded, as, far, as, armenia, laying, waste, all, before, them, now, tiridates, was, king, of, that, country, who, met, them, and, fought, them, but, was, lucky, not, to, have, been, taken, alive, in, the, battle, for, a, certain, man, threw, a, noose, over, him, and, would, soon, have, drawn, him, in, had, he, not, immediately, cut, the, cord, with, his, sword, and, escaped, so, the, alans, being, still, more, provoked, by, this, sight, laid, waste, the, country, and, drove, a, great, multitude, of, the, men, and, a, great, quantity, of, the, other, booty, from, both, kingdoms, along, with, them, and, then, retreated, back, to, their, own, country, the, fact, that, the, alans, invaded, parthia, through, hyrcania, shows, that, at, the, time, many, alans, were, still, based, north, east, of, the, caspian, sea, by, the, early, 2nd, century, ce, the, alans, were, in, firm, control, of, the, lower, volga, and, kuban, these, lands, had, earlier, been, occupied, by, the, aorsi, and, the, siraces, whom, the, alans, apparently, absorbed, dispersed, and, or, destroyed, since, they, were, no, longer, mentioned, in, contemporaneous, accounts, it, is, likely, that, the, alans, influence, stretched, further, westwards, encompassing, most, of, the, sarmatian, world, which, by, then, possessed, a, relatively, homogenous, culture, in, 135, ce, the, alans, made, a, huge, raid, into, asia, minor, via, the, caucasus, ravaging, media, and, armenia, they, were, eventually, driven, back, by, arrian, the, governor, of, cappadocia, who, wrote, a, detailed, report, ektaxis, kata, alanoon, or, war, against, the, alans, that, is, a, major, source, for, studying, roman, military, tactics, from, 215, to, 250, the, germanic, goths, expanded, south, eastwards, and, broke, the, alan, dominance, on, the, pontic, steppe, the, alans, however, seem, to, have, had, a, significant, influence, on, the, culture, of, the, goths, who, became, excellent, horsemen, and, adopted, the, alanic, animal, style, art, the, roman, empire, during, the, chaos, of, the, 3rd, century, civil, wars, suffered, damaging, raids, by, the, gothic, armies, with, their, heavy, cavalry, before, the, illyrian, emperors, adapted, to, the, gothic, tactics, reorganized, and, expanded, the, roman, heavy, cavalry, and, defeated, the, goths, under, gallienus, claudius, ii, and, aurelian, after, the, gothic, entry, to, the, steppe, many, of, the, alans, seem, to, have, retreated, eastwards, towards, the, don, where, they, seem, to, have, established, contacts, with, the, huns, ammianus, writes, that, the, alans, were, somewhat, like, the, huns, but, in, their, manner, of, life, and, their, habits, they, are, less, savage, jordanes, contrasted, them, with, the, huns, noting, that, the, alans, were, their, equals, in, battle, but, unlike, them, in, their, civilisation, manners, and, appearance, in, the, late, 4th, century, vegetius, conflates, alans, and, huns, in, his, military, treatise, hunnorum, alannorumque, natio, the, nation, of, huns, and, alans, and, collocates, goths, huns, and, alans, exemplo, gothorum, et, alannorum, hunnorumque, the, 4th, century, roman, historian, ammianus, marcellinus, noted, that, the, alans, were, formerly, called, massagetae, while, dio, cassius, wrote, that, they, are, massagetae, it, is, likely, that, the, alans, were, an, amalgamation, of, various, iranian, peoples, including, sarmatians, massagetae, and, sakas, scholars, have, connected, the, alans, to, the, nomadic, state, of, yancai, mentioned, in, chinese, sources, the, yancai, are, first, mentioned, in, connection, with, late, 2nd, century, bce, diplomat, zhang, qian, s, travels, in, chapter, 123, of, shiji, whose, author, sima, qian, died, c, 90, bce, the, yancai, of, chinese, records, has, again, been, equated, with, the, aorsi, a, powerful, sarmatian, tribe, living, between, the, don, river, and, the, aral, sea, mentioned, in, roman, records, in, particular, strabo, the, later, han, dynasty, chinese, chronicle, the, hou, hanshu, 88, covering, the, period, 25, 220, and, completed, in, the, 5th, century, mentioned, a, report, that, the, yancai, nation, lit, vast, steppes, or, extensive, grasslands, lhc, am, b, s, c, a, k, a, hesu, compare, latin, abzoae, identified, with, the, aorsi, ancient, greek, had, become, a, vassal, state, of, the, kangju, and, was, now, known, as, alan, lhc, l, n, y, a, zadneprovskiy, suggests, that, the, kangju, subjugation, of, yancai, occurred, in, the, 1st, century, bce, and, that, this, subjugation, caused, various, sarmatian, tribes, including, the, aorsi, to, migrate, westwards, which, played, a, major, role, in, starting, the, migration, period, the, 3rd, century, weil, e, also, notes, that, yancai, was, then, known, to, be, alans, although, they, were, no, longer, vassals, of, the, kangju, dutch, sinologist, a, f, p, hulsew, noted, that, chavannes, 1905, p, 558, note, 5, approves, of, the, identification, of, yen, ts, ai, with, the, mentioned, by, strabo, as, proposed, by, hirth, 1885, p, 139, note, 1, he, believes, this, identification, to, be, strengthened, by, the, later, name, alan, which, explains, ptolemy, s, alanorsi, marquart, 1905, pp, 240, 241, did, not, accept, this, identification, but, pulleyblank, 1963, pp, 99, and, 220, does, referring, for, additional, support, to, hspc, 70, 6b, where, the, name, ho, su, reconstructed, in, old, chinese, as, a, p, sa, can, be, compared, with, abzoae, found, in, pliny, vi, 38, see, also, pulleyblank, 1968, p, 252, also, humbach, 1969, pp, 39, 40, accepts, the, identification, though, with, some, reserve, around, 370, according, to, ammianus, the, peaceful, relations, between, the, alans, and, huns, were, broken, after, the, huns, attacked, the, don, alans, killing, many, of, them, and, establishing, an, alliance, with, the, survivors, these, alans, successfully, invaded, the, goths, in, 375, together, with, the, huns, they, subsequently, accompanied, the, huns, in, their, westward, expansion, following, the, hunnic, invasion, in, 370, other, alans, along, with, other, sarmatians, migrated, westward, one, of, these, alan, groups, fought, together, with, the, goths, in, the, decisive, battle, of, adrianople, in, 378, ce, in, which, emperor, valens, was, killed, as, the, roman, empire, continued, to, decline, the, alans, split, into, various, groups, some, fought, for, the, romans, while, others, joined, the, huns, visigoths, or, ostrogoths, a, portion, of, the, western, alans, joined, the, vandals, and, the, suebi, in, their, invasion, of, roman, gaul, gregory, of, tours, mentions, in, his, liber, historiae, francorum, book, of, frankish, history, that, the, alan, king, respendial, saved, the, day, for, the, vandals, in, an, armed, encounter, with, the, franks, at, the, crossing, of, the, rhine, on, december, 31, 406, according, to, gregory, another, group, of, alans, led, by, goar, crossed, the, rhine, at, the, same, time, but, immediately, joined, the, romans, and, settled, in, gaul, under, beorgor, beorgor, rex, alanorum, they, moved, throughout, gaul, till, the, reign, of, petronius, maximus, when, they, crossed, the, alps, in, the, winter, of, 464, into, liguria, but, were, there, defeated, and, beorgor, slain, by, ricimer, commander, of, the, emperor, s, forces, in, 442, after, it, became, clear, to, aetius, that, he, could, no, longer, rely, upon, the, huns, for, support, he, turned, to, goar, and, persuaded, him, to, move, some, of, his, people, to, settlements, in, the, orleanais, in, order, to, control, the, bacaudae, of, armorica, and, to, keep, the, visigoths, from, expanding, their, territories, northward, across, the, loire, goar, settled, a, substantial, number, of, his, followers, in, the, orleanais, and, the, area, to, the, north, and, personally, moved, his, own, capital, to, the, city, of, orleans, under, goar, they, allied, with, the, burgundians, led, by, gundaharius, with, whom, they, installed, the, emperor, jovinus, as, usurper, under, goar, s, successor, sangiban, the, alans, of, orl, ans, played, a, critical, role, in, repelling, the, invasion, of, attila, the, hun, at, the, battle, of, ch, lons, in, 463, the, alans, defeated, the, goths, at, the, battle, of, orl, ans, and, they, later, defeated, the, franks, led, by, childeric, in, 466, around, 502, 503, clovis, attacked, armorica, but, was, defeated, by, the, alans, however, the, alans, who, were, chalcedonian, christians, like, clovis, desired, cordial, relations, with, him, to, counterbalance, the, hostile, arian, visigoths, who, coveted, the, land, north, of, the, loire, therefore, an, accord, was, arranged, by, which, clovis, came, to, rule, the, various, peoples, of, armorica, and, the, military, strength, of, the, area, was, integrated, into, the, merovingian, military, following, the, fortunes, of, the, vandals, and, suebi, into, the, iberian, peninsula, hispania, comprising, modern, portugal, and, spain, in, 409, the, alans, led, by, respendial, settled, in, the, provinces, of, lusitania, and, carthaginensis, the, kingdom, of, the, alans, was, among, the, first, barbarian, kingdoms, to, be, founded, the, siling, vandals, settled, in, baetica, the, suebi, in, coastal, gallaecia, and, the, asding, vandals, in, the, rest, of, gallaecia, although, the, newcomers, controlled, hispania, they, were, still, a, tiny, minority, among, a, larger, hispano, roman, population, approximately, 200, 000, out, of, 6, 000, 000, in, 418, or, 426, according, to, some, authors, the, alan, king, attaces, was, killed, in, battle, against, the, visigoths, and, this, branch, of, the, alans, subsequently, appealed, to, the, asding, vandal, king, gunderic, to, accept, the, alan, crown, the, separate, ethnic, identity, of, respendial, s, alans, dissolved, although, some, of, these, alans, are, thought, to, have, remained, in, iberia, most, went, to, north, africa, with, the, vandals, in, 429, later, the, rulers, of, the, vandal, kingdom, in, north, africa, styled, themselves, rex, wandalorum, et, alanorum, king, of, the, vandals, and, alans, there, are, some, vestiges, of, the, alans, in, portugal, namely, in, alenquer, whose, name, may, be, germanic, for, the, temple, of, the, alans, from, alan, kerk, and, whose, castle, may, have, been, established, by, them, the, alaunt, is, still, represented, in, that, city, s, coat, of, arms, in, the, construction, of, the, castles, of, torres, vedras, and, almourol, and, in, the, city, walls, of, lisbon, where, vestiges, of, their, presence, may, be, found, under, the, foundations, of, the, church, of, santa, luzia, in, the, iberian, peninsula, the, alans, settled, in, lusitania, alentejo, and, the, cartaginense, provinces, they, became, known, in, retrospect, for, their, massive, hunting, and, fighting, running, mastiff, type, dogs, the, alaunt, which, they, apparently, introduced, to, europe, the, breed, is, extinct, but, its, name, is, carried, by, a, spanish, breed, of, dog, still, called, alano, traditionally, used, in, boar, hunting, and, cattle, herding, the, alano, name, however, has, historically, been, used, for, a, number, of, dog, breeds, in, a, few, european, countries, thought, to, descend, from, the, original, dog, of, the, alans, such, as, the, german, mastiff, great, dane, and, the, french, dogue, de, bordeaux, among, others, the, alans, who, remained, in, their, original, area, of, settlement, north, of, the, caucasus, and, for, a, time, east, of, the, caspian, sea, as, well, came, into, contact, and, conflict, with, the, bulgars, the, g, kturks, and, the, khazars, who, drove, most, of, them, from, the, plains, and, into, the, mountains, the, alans, converted, to, byzantine, orthodoxy, in, the, first, quarter, of, the, 10th, century, during, the, patriarchate, of, nicholas, i, mystikos, al, mas, udi, reports, that, they, apostasized, in, 932, but, this, seems, to, have, been, short, lived, the, alans, are, collectively, mentioned, as, byzantine, rite, christians, in, the, 13th, century, the, caucasian, alans, were, the, ancestors, of, the, modern, ossetians, whose, ethnonym, derives, from, the, name, s, very, probably, the, ancient, aorsi, al, ma, sudi, mentions, al, arsiyya, as, guards, among, the, khazars, and, the, rus, called, the, alans, yasi, a, sister, tribe, of, the, alans, the, armenian, geography, uses, the, name, ashtigor, for, the, most, westerly, located, alans, a, name, which, survives, as, digor, and, still, refers, to, the, western, division, of, the, ossetians, furthermore, in, ossetian, asi, refers, to, the, region, around, mount, elbrus, where, they, probably, formerly, lived, some, of, the, other, alans, remained, under, the, rule, of, the, huns, those, of, the, eastern, division, though, dispersed, about, the, steppes, until, late, medieval, times, were, forced, by, the, mongols, into, the, caucasus, where, they, remain, as, the, ossetians, between, the, 9th, and, 12th, centuries, they, formed, a, network, of, tribal, alliances, that, gradually, evolved, into, the, christian, kingdom, of, alania, most, alans, submitted, to, the, mongol, empire, in, 1239, 1277, they, participated, in, mongol, invasions, of, europe, and, the, song, dynasty, in, southern, china, and, the, battle, of, kulikovo, under, mamai, of, the, golden, horde, in, 1253, the, franciscan, friar, william, of, rubruck, reported, numerous, europeans, in, central, asia, it, is, also, known, that, 30, 000, alans, formed, the, royal, guard, asud, of, the, yuan, court, in, dadu, beijing, marco, polo, later, reported, their, role, in, the, yuan, dynasty, in, his, book, il, milione, it, is, said, that, those, alans, contributed, to, a, modern, mongol, clan, asud, john, of, montecorvino, archbishop, of, dadu, khanbaliq, reportedly, converted, many, alans, to, roman, catholic, christianity, in, addition, to, armenians, in, china, in, poland, and, lithuania, alans, were, also, part, of, the, powerful, clan, of, ostoja, according, to, the, missionary, pian, de, carpine, a, part, of, the, alans, had, successfully, resisted, a, mongol, siege, on, a, mountain, for, 12, years, when, they, the, mongols, begin, to, besiege, a, fortress, they, besiege, it, for, many, years, as, it, happens, today, with, one, mountain, in, the, land, of, the, alans, we, believe, they, have, been, besieging, it, for, twelve, years, and, they, the, alans, put, up, courageous, resistance, and, killed, many, tatars, including, many, noble, ones, this, twelve, year, long, siege, is, not, found, in, any, other, report, however, the, russian, historian, a, i, krasnov, connected, this, battle, with, two, chechen, folktales, he, recorded, in, 1967, that, spoke, of, an, old, hunter, named, idig, who, with, his, companions, defended, the, dakuoh, mountain, for, 12, years, against, tatar, mongols, he, also, reported, to, have, found, several, arrowheads, and, spears, from, the, 13th, century, near, the, very, mountain, the, battle, took, place, at, against, the, alans, and, the, cumans, kipchaks, the, mongols, used, divide, and, conquer, tactics, by, first, telling, the, cumans, to, stop, allying, with, the, alans, and, after, the, cumans, followed, their, suggestion, the, mongols, then, attacked, the, cumans, after, defeating, the, alans, alans, were, recruited, into, the, mongol, forces, with, one, unit, called, right, alan, guard, which, was, combined, with, recently, surrendered, soldiers, mongols, and, chinese, soldiers, stationed, in, the, area, of, the, former, kingdom, of, qocho, and, in, besh, balikh, the, mongols, established, a, chinese, military, colony, led, by, chinese, general, qi, kongzhi, ch, i, kung, chih, alan, and, kipchak, guards, were, used, by, kublai, khan, in, 1368, at, the, end, of, the, yuan, dynasty, in, china, toghan, tem, r, was, accompanied, by, his, faithful, alan, guards, mangu, enlisted, in, his, bodyguard, half, the, troops, of, the, alan, prince, arslan, whose, younger, son, nicholas, took, a, part, in, the, expedition, of, the, mongols, against, karajang, yunnan, this, alan, imperial, guard, was, still, in, existence, in, 1272, 1286, and, 1309, and, it, was, divided, into, two, corps, with, headquarters, in, the, ling, pei, province, karakor, m, the, french, flemish, friar, and, traveler, william, of, rubruck, mentions, alans, numerous, times, in, the, account, of, his, 1253, 1255, journey, through, eurasia, to, the, great, khan, e, g, alans, living, as, mongol, subjects, in, crimea, old, astrakhan, the, khan, s, capital, karakorum, and, also, still, as, freemen, in, their, caucasian, homeland, the, alans, or, aas, who, are, christians, and, still, fight, the, tartars, the, reason, why, the, earlier, persian, word, tersa, was, gradually, abandoned, by, the, mongols, in, favour, of, the, syro, greek, word, arkon, when, speaking, of, christians, manifestly, is, that, no, specifically, greek, church, was, ever, heard, of, in, china, until, the, russians, had, been, conquered, besides, there, were, large, bodies, of, russian, and, alan, guards, at, peking, throughout, the, last, half, of, the, thirteenth, and, first, half, of, the, fourteenth, century, and, the, catholics, there, would, not, be, likely, to, encourage, the, use, of, a, persian, word, which, was, most, probably, applicable, in, the, first, instance, to, the, nestorians, they, found, so, degenerated, the, alan, guards, converted, to, catholicism, as, reported, by, odorico, they, were, a, russian, guard, it, is, believed, that, some, alans, resettled, to, the, north, barsils, merging, with, volga, bulgars, and, burtas, eventually, transforming, to, volga, tatars, it, is, supposed, that, the, iasi, a, group, of, alans, founded, a, town, in, the, northeast, of, romania, about, 1200, 1300, near, the, prut, river, called, ia, i, the, latter, became, the, capital, of, moldavia, in, the, middle, ages, alan, mercenaries, were, involved, in, the, affair, with, the, catalan, company, descendants, of, the, alans, who, live, in, the, autonomous, republics, of, russia, and, georgia, speak, the, ossetian, language, which, belongs, to, the, northeastern, iranian, language, group, and, is, the, only, remnant, of, the, scytho, sarmatian, dialect, continuum, which, once, stretched, over, much, of, the, pontic, steppe, and, central, asia, modern, ossetian, has, two, major, dialects, digor, spoken, in, the, western, part, of, north, ossetia, and, iron, spoken, in, the, rest, of, ossetia, a, third, branch, of, ossetian, jassic, j, sz, was, formerly, spoken, in, hungary, the, literary, language, based, on, the, iron, dialect, was, fixed, by, the, national, poet, kosta, khetagurov, 1859, 1906, the, fourth, century, roman, historian, ammianus, marcellinus, wrote, this, on, the, appearance, of, the, alans, nearly, all, the, alani, are, men, of, great, stature, and, beauty, their, hair, is, somewhat, yellow, their, eyes, are, terribly, fierce, in, a, study, conducted, in, 2014, by, v, v, ilyinskyon, on, bone, fragments, from, 10, alanic, burials, on, the, don, river, dna, could, be, abstracted, from, a, total, of, seven, four, of, them, turned, out, to, belong, to, ydna, haplogroup, g2, and, six, of, them, had, mtdna, i, the, fact, that, many, of, the, samples, share, the, same, y, and, mtdna, raises, the, possibility, that, the, tested, individuals, belonged, to, the, same, tribe, or, even, were, close, relatives, nevertheless, this, supports, the, argument, for, a, direct, alan, ancestry, of, ossetians, competing, with, the, hypothesis, that, ossetians, are, alanized, caucasic, speakers, as, the, main, haplogroup, among, ossetians, is, also, g2, in, 2015, the, institute, of, archaeology, in, moscow, conducted, research, on, various, sarmato, alan, and, saltovo, mayaki, culture, kurgan, burials, in, this, analysis, the, two, alan, samples,

the, ancient, language, of, the, alans, was, an, eastern, iranian, dialect, either, identical, or, at, least, closely, related, to, ancient, eastern, iranian, languages, this, is, confirmed, by, comparison, of, the, word, for, horse, in, various, indo, iranian, languages, and, the, reconstructed, alanic, word, for, horse, prior, to, their, christianisation, the, alans, were, indo, iranian, polytheists, subscribing, either, to, the, poorly, understood, scythian, pantheon, or, to, a, polytheistic, form, of, zoroastrianism, some, traditions, were, directly, inherited, from, the, scythians,
