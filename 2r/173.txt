hurro, urartian, language, family, since, its, re, discovery, in, the, 19th, century, urartu, which, is, commonly, believed, to, have, been, at, least, partially, armenian, speaking, has, played, a,

consonants, r, and, t, in, the, urartu, reading, and, as, the, data, in, the, table, shows, it, is, the, result, of, the, misunderstanding, that, the, cuneiform, scholars, who, read, the, name, of, the, country, took, the, readings, ar, and, ar2, of, the, ar, and, ub, cuneiform, signs, respectively, and, ignored, their, readings, ara8, and, ara2, on, the, famous, babylonian, map, representing, the, ancient, world, in, the, 8th, century, bc, see, figure, 1, in, the, inscription, of, the, assyrian, king, nabopolassar, in, 626, 604, bc, and, in, the, behistun, inscription, of, the, achaemenid,

were, captured, by, the, assyrians, under, the, neo, assyrian, emperor, shalmaneser, iii, urartologist, paul, zimansky, speculated, that, the, urartians, or, at, least, their, ruling, family, after, arame, may, have, emigrated, northwest, into, the, lake, van, region, from, their, religious, capital, of, musasir, according, to, zimansky, the, urartian, ruling, class, were, few, in, number, and, governed, over, an, ethnically, culturally, and, linguistically, diverse, population, zimansky, went, so, far, as, to, suggest, that, the, kings, of, urartu, might, have, come, from, various, ethnic, backgrounds, themselves, assyria, fell, into, a, period, of, temporary, stagnation, for, decades, during, the, first, half, of, the, 9th, century, bc, which, had, aided, urartu, s, growth, within, a, short, time, it, became, one, of, the, largest, and, most, powerful, states, in, the, near, east, sarduri, i, c, 832, 820, bc, the, son, of, lutipri, established, a, new, dynasty, and, successfully, resisted, assyrian, attacks, from, the, south, led, by, shalmaneser, iii, consolidated, the, military, power, of, the, state, and, moved, the, capital, to, tushpa, modern, van, turkey, on, the, shore, of, lake, van, his, son, ispuini, c, 820, 800, bc, annexed, the, neighbouring, state, of, musasir, which, became, an, important, religious, centre, of, the, urartian, kingdom, and, introduced, the, cult, of, aldi, ispuini, was, also, the, first, urartian, king, to, write, in, the, urartian, language, previous, kings, left, records, written, in, akkadian, he, made, his, son, sarduri, ii, viceroy, after, conquering, musasir, ispuini, was, in, turn, attacked, by, shamshi, adad, v, his, co, regent, and, subsequent, successor, menua, c, 800, 785, bc, also, enlarged, the, kingdom, greatly, and, left, inscriptions, over, a, wide, area, during, ispuini, s, and, menua, s, joint, rule, they, shifted, from, referring, to, their, territory, as, nairi, instead, opting, for, bianili, urartu, reached, the, highest, point, of, its, military, might, under, menua, s, son, argishti, i, c, 785, 760, bc, becoming, one, of, the, most, powerful, kingdoms, of, ancient, near, east, argishti, i, added, more, territories, along, the, aras, and, lake, sevan, and, frustrated, shalmaneser, iv, s, campaigns, against, him, argishti, also, founded, several, new, cities, most, notably, erebuni, fortress, in, 782, bc, 6600, prisoners, of, war, from, hatti, and, supani, were, settled, in, the, new, city, at, its, height, the, urartu, kingdom, stretched, north, beyond, the, aras, and, lake, sevan, encompassing, present, day, armenia, and, even, the, southern, part, of, present, day, georgia, almost, to, the, shores, of, the, black, sea, west, to, the, sources, of, the, euphrates, east, to, present, day, tabriz, lake, urmia, and, beyond, and, south, to, the, sources, of, the, tigris, tiglath, pileser, iii, of, assyria, defeated, sarduri, ii, of, urartu, in, the, first, year, of, his, reign, 745, bc, there, the, assyrians, found, horsemen, and, horses, tamed, as, colts, for, riding, that, were, unequalled, in, the, south, where, they, were, harnessed, to, assyrian, war, chariots, kayal, dere, castle, is, one, of, the, important, centers, that, enabled, the, urartian, kingdom, to, control, the, surrounding, regions, from, lake, van, to, the, west, in, 714, bc, the, urartian, kingdom, suffered, heavily, from, cimmerian, raids, and, the, campaigns, of, sargon, ii, the, main, temple, at, musasir, was, sacked, and, the, urartian, king, rusa, i, was, crushingly, defeated, by, sargon, ii, at, lake, urmia, he, subsequently, committed, suicide, in, shame, rusa, s, son, argishti, ii, 714, 685, bc, restored, urartu, s, position, against, the, cimmerians, however, it, was, no, longer, a, threat, to, assyria, and, peace, was, made, with, the, new, king, of, assyria, sennacherib, in, 705, bc, this, in, turn, helped, urartu, enter, a, long, period, of, development, and, prosperity, which, continued, through, the, reign, of, argishti, s, son, rusa, ii, 685, 645, bc, after, rusa, ii, however, urartu, grew, weaker, under, constant, attacks, from, cimmerian, and, scythian, invaders, as, a, result, it, became, dependent, on, assyria, as, evidenced, by, rusa, ii, s, son, sarduri, iii, 645, 635, bc, referring, to, the, assyrian, king, ashurbanipal, as, his, father, according, to, urartian, epigraphy, sarduri, iii, was, followed, by, two, kings, rusa, iii, also, known, as, rusa, erimenahi, 620, 609, bc, and, his, son, rusa, iv, 609, 590, or, 585, bc, there, is, speculation, that, rusa, iii, s, father, erimena, may, have, been, a, king, as, well, possibly, ruling, from, 635, to, 620, bc, but, little, is, known, about, him, it, is, possible, that, rusa, iii, established, a, new, dynasty, and, that, his, father, erimena, had, not, been, king, late, during, the, 7th, century, bc, during, or, after, sarduri, iii, s, reign, urartu, was, invaded, by, scythians, and, their, allies, the, medes, in, 612, bc, the, median, king, cyaxares, the, great, together, with, nabopolassar, of, babylon, and, the, scythians, conquered, assyria, after, it, had, been, irreversibly, weakened, by, civil, war, the, medes, then, took, over, the, urartian, capital, of, van, in, 590, bc, effectively, ending, the, sovereignty, of, urartu, however, some, historians, believe, that, urartu, survived, until, the, middle, of, the, 6th, century, bc, and, was, eventually, destroyed, by, cyrus, the, great, many, urartian, ruins, of, the, period, show, evidence, of, destruction, by, fire, the, kingdom, of, van, was, destroyed, in, 590, bc, and, by, the, late, 6th, century, the, satrapy, of, armenia, had, replaced, it, little, is, known, of, what, happened, to, the, region, between, the, fall, of, the, kingdom, of, van, and, the, appearance, of, the, satrapy, of, armenia, according, to, historian, touraj, daryaee, during, the, armenian, rebellion, against, the, persian, king, darius, i, in, 521, bc, some, of, the, personal, and, topographic, names, attested, in, connection, with, armenia, or, armenians, were, of, urartian, origin, suggesting, that, urartian, elements, persisted, within, armenia, after, its, fall, in, the, behistun, inscription, c, 522, bc, refer, to, armenia, and, armenians, as, synonyms, of, urartu, and, urartians, the, toponym, urartu, did, not, disappear, however, as, the, name, of, the, province, of, ayrarat, in, the, center, of, the, kingdom, of, armenia, is, believed, to, be, its, continuum, as, the, armenian, identity, developed, in, the, region, the, memory, of, urartu, faded, and, disappeared, parts, of, its, history, passed, down, as, popular, stories, and, were, preserved, in, armenia, as, written, by, movses, khorenatsi, in, the, form, of, garbled, legends, in, his, 5th, century, book, history, of, armenia, where, he, speaks, of, a, first, armenian, kingdom, in, van, which, fought, wars, against, the, assyrians, khorenatsi, s, stories, of, these, wars, with, assyria, would, help, in, the, rediscovery, of, urartu, according, to, herodotus, the, alarodians, alarodioi, were, part, of, the, 18th, satrapy, of, the, achaemenid, empire, and, formed, a, special, contingent, in, the, grand, army, of, xerxes, i, some, scholars, have, tried, to, link, the, alarodians, to, urartians, suggesting, that, alarodian, was, a, variation, of, the, name, urartian, araratian, according, to, this, theory, the, urartians, of, the, 18th, satrapy, were, subsequently, absorbed, into, the, armenian, nation, modern, historians, however, have, cast, doubt, on, the, alarodian, connection, to, the, urartians, in, a, study, published, in, 2017, the, complete, mitochondrial, genomes, of, 4, ancient, skeletons, from, urartu, were, analyzed, alongside, other, ancient, populations, found, in, modern, day, armenia, and, artsakh, spanning, 7, 800, years, the, study, shows, that, modern, day, armenians, are, the, people, who, have, the, least, genetic, distance, from, those, ancient, skeletons, as, well, some, scholars, asserted, that, the, urartians, are, the, most, easily, identifiable, ancestors, of, the, armenians, urartu, comprised, an, area, of, approximately, 200, 000, square, miles, 520, 000, km, 2, extending, from, the, euphrates, in, the, west, to, lake, urmia, in, the, east, and, from, the, caucasus, mountains, south, towards, the, zagros, mountains, in, northern, iraq, more, specifically, urartu, was, an, area, directly, surrounded, by, the, mountain, chains, of, the, eastern, pontus, at, the, north, the, lesser, caucasus, at, to, the, northeast, and, the, taurus, mountains, at, the, south, it, was, centred, around, lake, van, which, is, located, in, present, day, eastern, anatolia, at, its, apogee, urartu, stretched, from, the, borders, of, northern, mesopotamia, to, the, southern, caucasus, including, present, day, turkey, nakhchivan, armenia, and, southern, georgia, up, to, the, river, kura, the, taurus, mountains, also, served, as, a, natural, barrier, against, southern, threats, particularly, from, the, assyrians, archaeological, sites, within, its, boundaries, include, altintepe, toprakkale, patnos, and, haykaberd, urartu, fortresses, included, erebuni, fortress, present, day, yerevan, van, fortress, argishtihinili, anzaf, haykaberd, and, ba, kale, as, well, as, teishebaini, karmir, blur, red, mound, and, others, urartian, inscriptions, were, found, in, kepenek, castle, located, on, a, hill, near, the, center, of, mu, and, in, the, alazl, inspired, by, the, writings, of, the, medieval, armenian, historian, movses, khorenatsi, who, had, described, urartian, works, in, van, and, attributed, them, to, the, legendary, ara, the, beautiful, and, queen, semiramis, the, french, scholar, antoine, jean, saint, martin, suggested, that, his, government, send, friedrich, eduard, schulz, a, german, professor, to, the, van, area, in, 1827, on, behalf, of, the, french, oriental, society, schulz, discovered, and, copied, numerous, cuneiform, inscriptions, partly, in, assyrian, and, partly, in, a, hitherto, unknown, language, schulz, also, discovered, the, kelishin, stele, bearing, an, assyrian, urartian, bilingual, inscription, located, on, the, kelishin, pass, on, the, current, iraqi, iranian, border, a, summary, account, of, his, initial, discoveries, was, published, in, 1828, schulz, and, four, of, his, servants, were, murdered, by, kurds, in, 1829, near, ba, kale, his, notes, were, later, recovered, and, published, in, paris, in, 1840, in, 1828, the, british, assyriologist, henry, creswicke, rawlinson, had, attempted, to, copy, the, inscription, on, the, kelishin, stele, but, failed, because, of, the, ice, on, the, stele, s, front, side, the, german, scholar, r, rosch, made, a, similar, attempt, a, few, years, later, but, he, and, his, party, were, attacked, and, killed, in, the, late, 1840s, sir, austen, henry, layard, examined, and, described, the, urartian, rock, cut, tombs, of, van, castle, including, the, argishti, chamber, from, the, 1870s, local, residents, began, to, plunder, the, toprakkale, ruins, selling, its, artefacts, to, european, collections, in, the, 1880s, this, site, underwent, a, poorly, executed, excavation, organised, by, hormuzd, rassam, on, behalf, of, the, british, museum, almost,

ship, the, ss, athenia, their, surviving, documents, were, published, by, manfred, korfmann, in, 1977, a, new, phase, of, excavations, began, after, the, war, excavations, were, at, first, restricted, to, soviet, armenia, the, fortress, of, karmir, blur, dating, from, the, reign, of, rusa, ii, was, excavated, by, a, team, headed, by, boris, piotrovsky, and, for, the, first, time, the, excavators, of, a, urartian, site, published, their, findings, systematically, beginning, in, 1956, charles, a, burney, identified, and, sketch, surveyed, many, urartian, sites, in, the, lake, van, area, and, from, 1959, a, turkish, expedition, under, tahsin, zg, excavated, altintepe, and, arif, erzen, in, the, late, 1960s, urartian, sites, in, northwest, iran, were, excavated, in, 1976, an, italian, team, led, by, mirjo, salvini, finally, reached, the, kelishin, stele, accompanied, by, a, heavy, military, escort, the, gulf, war, then, closed, these, sites, to, archaeological, research, oktay, belli, resumed, excavation, of, urartian, sites, on, turkish, territory, in, 1989, ayanis, a, 7th, century, bc, fortress, built, by, rusas, ii, of, urartu, was, discovered, 35, km, north, of, van, in, spite, of, excavations, only, a, third, to, a, half, of, the, 300, known, urartian, sites, in, turkey, iran, iraq, and, armenia, have, been, examined, by, archaeologists, wartke, 1993, without, protection, many, sites, have, been, plundered, by, local, residents, searching, for, treasure, and, other, saleable, antiquities, on, 12, november, 2017, it, was, announced, that, archaeologists, in, turkey, had, discovered, the, ruins, of, a, urartian, castle, during, underwater, excavations, around, lake, van, the, castle, dated, to, the, 8th, or, 7th, centuries, bc, the, economic, structure, of, urartu, was, similar, to, other, states, of, the, ancient, world, especially, assyria, the, state, was, heavily, dependent, on, agriculture, which, required, centralized, irrigation, these, works, were, managed, by, kings, but, implemented, by, free, inhabitants, and, possibly, slave, labour, provided, by, prisoners, royal, governors, influential, people, and, perhaps, free, peoples, had, their, own, allotments, individual, territories, within, the, state, had, to, pay, taxes, the, central, government, grain, horses, bulls, etc, in, peacetime, urartu, probably, led, an, active, trade, with, assyria, providing, cattle, horses, iron, and, wine, according, to, archaeological, data, farming, on, the, territory, of, urartu, developed, from, the, neolithic, even, in, the, 3rd, millennium, bc, in, the, urartian, age, agriculture, was, well, developed, and, closely, related, to, assyrian, methods, on, the, selection, of, cultures, and, methods, of, processing, from, cuneiform, sources, it, is, known, that, in, urartu, grew, wheat, barley, sesame, millet, and, emmer, and, cultivated, gardens, and, vineyards, many, regions, of, the, urartu, state, required, artificial, irrigation, which, has, successfully, been, organized, by, the, rulers, of, urartu, in, the, heyday, of, the, state, in, several, regions, remain, ancient, irrigation, canals, constructed, by, urartu, mainly, during, the, argishti, i, and, menua, period, some, of, which, are, still, used, for, irrigation, there, is, a, number, of, remains, of, sturdy, stone, architecture, as, well, as, some, mud, brick, especially, when, it, has, been, burnt, which, helps, survival, stone, remains, are, mainly, fortresses, and, walls, with, temples, and, mausolea, and, many, rock, cut, tombs, the, style, which, developed, regional, variations, shows, a, distinct, character, partly, because, of, the, greater, use, of, stone, compared, to, neighbouring, cultures, the, typical, temple, was, square, with, stone, walls, as, thick, as, the, open, internal, area, but, using, mud, brick, for, the, higher, part, these, were, placed, at, the, highest, point, of, a, citadel, and, from, surviving, depictions, were, high, perhaps, with, gabled, roofs, their, emphasis, on, verticality, has, been, claimed, as, an, influence, of, later, christian, armenian, architecture, the, art, of, urartu, is, especially, notable, for, fine, lost, wax, bronze, objects, weapons, figurines, vessels, including, grand, cauldrons, that, were, used, for, sacrifices, fittings, for, furniture, and, helmets, there, are, also, remains, of, ivory, and, bone, carvings, frescos, cylinder, seals, and, of, course, pottery, in, general, their, style, is, a, somewhat, less, sophisticated, blend, of, influences, from, neighbouring, cultures, archaeology, has, produced, relatively, few, examples, of, the, jewellery, in, precious, metals, that, the, assyrians, boasted, of, carrying, off, in, great, quantities, from, musasir, in, 714, bc, the, urartian, pantheon, seems, to, have, comprised, a, diverse, mix, of, hurrian, akkadian, armenian, and, hittite, deities, starting, with, the, reign, of, ishpuini, the, urartian, pantheon, was, headed, by, a, triad, made, up, of, aldi, the, supreme, god, theispas, teisheba, god, of, thunder, and, storms, as, well, as, sometimes, war, and, shivini, a, solar, god, their, king, was, also, the, chief, priest, or, envoy, of, aldi, some, temples, to, aldi, were, part, of, the, royal, palace, complex, while, others, were, independent, structures, with, the, expansion, of, urartian, territory, many, of, the, gods, worshipped, by, conquered, peoples, were, incorporated, into, the, urartian, pantheon, as, a, means, of, confirming, the, annexation, of, territories, and, promoting, political, stability, some, main, gods, and, goddesses, of, the, urartian, pantheon, include, aldi, was, not, a, native, urartian, god, but, apparently, an, obscure,

the, urartians, as, their, chief, god, his, cult, does, not, appear, to, have, been, introduced, until, the, reign, of, ishpuini, theispas, was, a, version, of, the, hurrian, god, teshub, according,

offerings, urartians, did, not, practice, human, sacrifice, a, number, of, the, gods, mentioned, in, the, gate, of, mehr, may, be, of, armenian, origins, including, ara, or, arwaa, and, possibly, the, goddess, selardi, although, there, is, confusion, about, this, deity, s, gender, and, name, some, believe, it, is, to, be, read, melardi, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, urartian, pantheon, could, correspond, to, mountain, peaks, located, within, the, armenian, highlands, the, modern, name, of, the, written, language, used, by, the, kingdom, s, political, elite, is, urartian, the, language, is, attested, in, numerous, cuneiform, inscriptions, throughout, armenia, and, eastern, turkey, it, is, unknown, what, other, languages, were, spoken, by, the, peoples, of, urartu, under, the, kingdom, of, van, but, there, is, evidence, of, linguistic, contact, between, the, proto, armenian, language, and, the, urartian, language, at, an, early, date, sometime, between, the, 3rd, 2nd, millennium, bc, before, the, formation, of, the, kingdom, urartians, used, assyrian, language, script, and, form, in, building, inscriptions, this, language, and, script, was, used, until, the, late, ninth, century, bc, when, the, urartian, language, was, used, urartian, is, the, modern, name, for, the, extinct, language, used, in, the, cuneiform, inscriptions, of, the, kingdom, of, urartu, its, only, known, relative, is, hurrian, together, they, form, the, small, hurro, urartian, language, family, other, names, used, to, refer, to, the, language, are, khaldian, aldian, or, neo, hurrian, the, latter, term, is, considered, problematic, however, as, it, is, now, thought, that, urartian, and, hurrian, share, a, common, ancestor, formerly, it, was, thought, that, urartian, was, descended, from, or, a, dialect, of, hurrian, in, fact, according, to, paul, zimansky, the, earliest, dialect, of, hurrian, seen, in, the, ti, atal, royal, inscription, and, reconstructed, from, various, early, second, millennium, b, c, e, sources, shows, features, that, disappeared, in, later, hurrian, but, are, present, in, urartian, wilhelm, 1988, 63, in, short, the, more, we, discover, or, deduce, about, the, earliest, stages, of, hurrian, the, more, it, looks, like, urartian, gragg, 1995, 2170, the, urartian, language, is, an, ergative, absolutive, agglutinative, language, which, belongs, to, neither, the, semitic, nor, the, indo, european, language, families, but, to, the, hurro, urartian, language, family, which, is, not, known, to, be, related, to, any, other, language, or, language, family, despite, repeated, attempts, to, find, genetic, links, examples, of, the, urartian, language, have, survived, in, many, inscriptions, written, in, the, assyrian, cuneiform, script, found, throughout, the, area, of, the, kingdom, of, urartu, although, the, bulk, of, the, cuneiform, inscriptions, within, urartu, were, written, in, the, urartian, language, a, minority, of, them, were, also, written, in, akkadian, the, official, language, of, assyria, there, are, also, claims, of, autochthonous, urartian, hieroglyphs, but, this, remains, uncertain, unlike, the, cuneiform, inscriptions, urartian, hieroglyphs, have, not, been, successfully, deciphered, as, a, result, scholars, disagree, as, to, what, language, is, used, or, whether, they, even, constitute, writing, at, all, the, urartians, originally, would, have, used, these, locally, developed, hieroglyphs, but, later, adapted, the, assyrian, cuneiform, script, for, most, purposes, after, the, 8th, century, bc, the, hieroglyphic, script, would, have, been, restricted, to, religious, and, accounting, purposes, the, kingdom, of, urartu, during, its, dominance, had, united, disparate, tribes, each, of, which, had, its, own, culture, and, traditions, thus, when, the, political, structure, was, destroyed, little, remained, that, could, be, identified, as, one, unified, urartian, culture, according, to, zimansky, far, from, being, grounded, on, long, standing, cultural, uniformities, was, merely, a, superstructure, of, authority, below, which, there, was, plenty, of, room, for, the, groups, to, manifest, in, the, anatolia, of, xenophon, to, flourish, we, need, not, hypothesize, massive, influxes, of, new, peoples, ethnic, replacement, or, any, very, great, mechanisms, of, cultural, change, the, armenians, carduchoi, chaldaioi, and, taochoi, could, easily, have, been, there, all, along, accommodated, and, concealed, within, the, structure, of, command, established, by, the, urartian, kings, ultimately, little, is, known, of, what, was, truly, spoken, in, the, geopolitical, region, until, the, creation, of, the, armenian, alphabet, in, the, 4th, century, ad, some, scholars, believe, that, the, ethnonym, armina, itself, and, all, other, names, attested, with, reference, to, the, rebellions, against, darius, in, the, satrapy, of, armenia, the, proper, names, araxa, haldita, and, d, d, i, the, toponyms, z, zahya, tigra, and, uyam, and, the, district, name, autiy, ra, are, not, connected, with, armenian, linguistic, and, onomastic, material, attested, later, in, native, armenian, sources, nor, are, they, iranian, but, seem, related, to, urartian, however, others, suggest, that, some, of, these, names, have, armenian, or, iranian, etymologies, the, presence, of, a, population, who, spoke, proto, armenian, in, urartu, prior, to, its, demise, is, subject, to, speculation, but, the, existence, of, urartian, words, in, the, armenian, language, and, armenian, loanwords, into, urartian, suggests, early, contact, between, the, two, languages, and, long, periods, of, bilingualism, the, presence, of, toponyms, tribal, names, and, deities, of, probable, proto, armenian, etymologies, which, are, attested, in, records, left, by, urartian, kings, such, as, uelikuni, uduri, etiuni, abiliani, and, arzashkun, the, personal, names, arame, and, dia, uni, and, the, deities, ar, ibedini, and, aniqu, further, supports, the, presence, of, an, armenian, speaking, population, in, at, least, the, northern, regions, of, urartu, the, urartian, confederation, united, the, disparate, peoples, of, the, highlands, which, began, a, process, of, intermingling, of, the, peoples, and, cultures, probably, including, armenian, tribes, and, languages, probably, including, proto, armenian, within, the, highlands, this, intermixing, would, ultimately, culminate, in, the, emergence, of, the, armenian, language, as, the, dominant, language, within, the, region, a, theory, supported, by, the, official, historiography, of, armenia, and, experts, in, assyrian, and, urartian, studies, such, as, igor, m, diakonoff, giorgi, melikishvili, mikhail, nikolsky, and, ivan, mestchaninov, suggests, that, urartian, was, solely, the, formal, written, language, of, the, state, while, its, inhabitants, including, the, royal, family, spoke, proto, armenian, this, theory, primarily, hinges, on, the, fact, that, the, urartian, language, used, in, the, cuneiform, inscriptions, were, very, repetitive, and, scant, in, vocabulary, having, as, little, as, 350, 400, roots, furthermore, over, 250, years, of, usage, it, shows, no, development, which, is, taken, to, indicate, that, the, language, had, ceased, to, be, spoken, before, the, time, of, the, inscriptions, or, was, used, only, for, official, purposes, a, complementary, theory, suggested, by, tamaz, v, gamkrelidze, and, ivanov, in, 1984, places, the, proto, indo, european, homeland, the, location, where, indo, european, would, have, emerged, from, in, the, armenian, highlands, which, would, entail, the, presence, of, proto, armenians, in, the, area, during, the, entire, lifetime, of, the, urartian, state, although, this, theory, has, less, support, than, the, more, popular, kurgan, hypothesis, the, armenian, hypothesis, would, support, the, theory, that, the, urartian, language, was, not, spoken, but, simply, written, and, postulates, that, the, armenian, language, was, an, in, situ, development, of, a, 3rd, millennium, bc, proto, indo, european, language, 38, 30, 00, n, 43, 20, 33, e,
