japan, primarily, over, influence, in, korea, after, more, than, six, months, of, unbroken, successes, by, japanese, land, and, naval, forces, and, the, loss, of, the, port, of, weihaiwei, the, qing, government, sued, for, peace, in, february, 1895, and, signed, the, unequal, treaty, of, shimonoseki, two, months, later, the, war, demonstrated, the, failure, of, the, qing, dynasty, s, attempts, to, modernize, its, military, and, fend, off, threats, to, its, sovereignty, especially, when, compared, with, japan, s, successful, meiji, restoration, for, the, first, time, regional, dominance, in, east, asia, shifted, from, china, to, japan, the, prestige, of, the, qing, dynasty, along, with, the, classical, tradition, in, china, suffered, a, major, blow, the, humiliating, loss, of, korea, as, a, tributary, state, sparked, an, unprecedented, public, outcry, within, china, the, defeat, was, a, catalyst, for, a, series, of, political, upheavals, led, by, sun, yat, sen, and, kang, youwei, culminating, in, the, 1911, revolution, and, ultimate, end, of, dynastic, rule, in, china, the, war, is, commonly, known, in, china, as, the, war, of, jiawu, chinese, pinyin, ji, w, zh, nzh, ng, referring, to, the, year, 1894, as, named, under, the, traditional, sexagenary, system, of, years, in, japan, it, is, called, the, japan, qing, war, japanese, hepburn, nisshin, sens, in, korea, where, much, of, the, war, took, place, it, is, called, the, qing, japan, war, korean, hanja, after, two, centuries, the, japanese, policy, of, seclusion, under, the, sh, guns, of, the, edo, period, came, to, an, end, when, the, country, was, opened, to, trade, by, the, convention, of, kanagawa, in, 1854, in, the, years, following, the, meiji, restoration, of, 1868, and, the, fall, of, the, shogunate, the, newly, formed, meiji, government, embarked, on, reforms, to, centralize, and, modernize, japan, the, japanese, had, sent, delegations, and, students, around, the, world, to, learn, and, assimilate, western, arts, and, sciences, with, the, intention, of, making, japan, an, equal, to, the, western, powers, these, reforms, transformed, japan, from, a, feudal, society, into, a, modern, industrial, state, during, the, same, time, period, the, qing, dynasty, also, started, to, undergo, reform, in, both, military, and, political, doctrine, but, was, far, less, successful, in, january, 1864, king, cheoljong, died, without, a, male, heir, and, through, korean, succession, protocols, king, gojong, ascended, the, throne, at, the, age, of, 12, however, as, king, gojong, was, too, young, to, rule, the, new, king, s, father, yi, ha, ng, became, the, daewongun, or, lord, of, the, great, court, and, ruled, korea, in, his, son, s, name, as, regent, originally, the, term, daewongun, referred, to, any, person, who, was, not, actually, the, king, but, whose, son, took, the, throne, with, his, ascendancy, to, power, the, daewongun, initiated, a, set, of, reforms, designed, to, strengthen, the, monarchy, at, the, expense, of, the, yangban, class, he, also, pursued, an, isolationist, policy, and, was, determined, to, purge, the, kingdom, of, any, foreign, ideas, that, had, infiltrated, into, the, nation, in, korean, history, the, king, s, in, laws, enjoyed, great, power, consequently, the, daewongun, acknowledged, that, any, future, daughters, in, law, might, threaten, his, authority, therefore, he, attempted, to, prevent, any, possible, threat, to, his, rule, by, selecting, as, a, new, queen, for, his, son, an, orphaned, girl, from, among, the, y, h, ng, min, clan, which, lacked, powerful, political, connections, with, queen, min, as, his, daughter, in, law, and, the, royal, consort, the, daewongun, felt, secure, in, his, power, however, after, she, had, become, queen, min, recruited, all, her, relatives, and, had, them, appointed, to, influential, positions, in, the, name, of, the, king, the, queen, also, allied, herself, with, political, enemies, of, the, daewongun, so, that, by, late, 1873, she, had, mobilized, enough, influence, to, oust, him, from, power, in, october, 1873, when, the, confucian, scholar, choe, ik, hyeon, submitted, a, memorial, to, king, gojong, urging, him, to, rule, in, his, own, right, queen, min, seized, the, opportunity, to, force, her, father, in, law, s, retirement, as, regent, the, departure, of, the, daewongun, led, to, korea, s, abandonment, of, its, isolationist, policy, on, february, 26, 1876, after, confrontations, between, the, japanese, and, koreans, the, ganghwa, treaty, was, signed, opening, korea, to, japanese, trade, in, 1880, the, king, sent, a, mission, to, japan, that, was, headed, by, kim, hong, jip, an, enthusiastic, observer, of, the, reforms, taking, place, there, while, in, japan, the, chinese, diplomat, huang, zunxian, presented, him, with, a, study, called, a, strategy, for, korea, chinese, pinyin, ch, oxi, n, c, l, it, warned, of, the, threat, to, korea, posed, by, the, russians, and, recommended, that, korea, maintain, friendly, relations, with, japan, which, was, at, the, time, too, economically, weak, to, be, an, immediate, threat, to, work, closely, with, china, and, seek, an, alliance, with, the, united, states, as, a, counterweight, to, russia, after, returning, to, korea, kim, presented, the, document, to, king, gojong, who, was, so, impressed, with, the, document, that, he, had, copies, made, and, distributed, to, his, officials, in, 1880, following, chinese, advice, and, breaking, with, tradition, king, gojong, decided, to, establish, diplomatic, ties, with, the, united, states, after, negotiations, through, chinese, mediation, in, tianjin, the, treaty, of, peace, amity, commerce, and, navigation, was, formally, signed, between, the, united, states, and, korea, in, incheon, on, may, 22, 1882, however, there, were, two, significant, issues, raised, by, the, treaty, the, first, concerned, korea, s, status, as, an, independent, nation, during, the, talks, with, the, americans, the, chinese, insisted, that, the, treaty, contain, an, article, declaring, that, korea, was, a, dependency, of, china, and, argued, that, the, country, had, long, been, a, tributary, state, of, china, but, the, americans, firmly, opposed, such, an, article, arguing, that, a, treaty, with, korea, should, be, based, on, the, treaty, of, ganghwa, which, stipulated, that, korea, was, an, independent, state, a, compromise, was, finally, reached, with, shufeldt, and, li, agreeing, that, the, king, of, korea, would, notify, the, u, s, president, in, a, letter, that, korea, had, special, status, as, a, tributary, state, of, china, the, treaty, between, the, korean, government, and, the, united, states, became, the, model, for, all, treaties, between, it, and, other, western, countries, korea, later, signed, similar, trade, and, commerce, treaties, with, great, britain, and, germany, in, 1883, with, italy, and, russia, in, 1884, and, with, france, in, 1886, subsequently, commercial, treaties, were, concluded, with, other, european, countries, after, 1879, china, s, relations, with, korea, came, under, the, authority, of, li, hongzhang, who, had, emerged, as, one, of, the, most, influential, figures, in, china, after, playing, an, important, role, during, the, taiping, rebellion, and, was, also, an, advocate, of, the, self, strengthening, movement, in, 1879, li, was, appointed, as, governor, general, of, zhili, province, and, the, imperial, commissioner, for, the, northern, ports, he, was, in, charge, of, china, s, korea, policy, and, urged, korean, officials, to, adopt, china, s, own, self, strengthening, program, to, strengthen, their, country, in, response, to, foreign, threats, to, which, king, gojong, was, receptive, the, korean, government, immediately, after, opening, the, country, to, the, outside, world, pursued, a, policy, of, enlightenment, aimed, at, achieving, national, prosperity, and, military, strength, through, the, doctrine, of, tongdo, s, gi, eastern, ways, and, western, machines, to, modernize, their, country, the, koreans, tried, selectively, to, accept, and, master, western, technology, while, preserving, their, country, s, cultural, values, and, heritage, in, january, 1881, the, government, launched, administrative, reforms, and, established, the, t, ongni, kimu, amun, office, for, extraordinary, state, affairs, which, was, modeled, on, chinese, administrative, structures, under, this, overarching, organization, twelve, sa, or, agencies, were, created, in, 1881, a, technical, mission, was, sent, to, japan, to, survey, its, modernized, facilities, officials, traveled, all, over, japan, inspecting, administrative, military, educational, and, industrial, facilities, in, october, another, small, group, went, to, tianjin, to, study, modern, weapons, manufacturing, and, chinese, technicians, were, invited, to, manufacture, weapons, in, seoul, additionally, as, part, of, their, plan, to, modernize, the, country, the, koreans, had, invited, the, japanese, military, attach, lieutenant, horimoto, reiz, to, serve, as, an, adviser, in, creating, a, modern, army, a, new, military, formation, called, the, py, lgigun, special, skills, force, was, established, in, which, eighty, to, one, hundred, young, men, of, the, aristocracy, were, to, be, given, japanese, military, training, the, following, year, in, january, 1882, the, government, also, reorganized, the, existing, five, army, garrison, structure, into, the, muwiy, ng, palace, guards, garrison, and, the, chang, y, ng, capital, guards, garrison, during, the, 1880s, discussions, in, japan, about, national, security, focused, on, the, issue, of, korean, reform, the, political, discourse, over, the, two, were, interlinked, as, the, german, military, adviser, major, jacob, meckel, stated, korea, was, a, dagger, pointed, at, the, heart, of, japan, what, made, korea, of, strategic, concern, was, not, merely, its, proximity, to, japan, but, its, inability, to, defend, itself, against, outsiders, if, korea, were, truly, independent, it, posed, no, strategic, problem, to, japan, s, national, security, but, if, the, country, remained, undeveloped, it, would, remain, weak, and, consequently, would, be, inviting, prey, for, foreign, domination, the, political, consensus, in, japan, was, that, korean, independence, lay, as, it, had, been, for, meiji, japan, through, the, importation, of, civilization, from, the, west, korea, required, a, program, of, self, strengthening, like, the, post, restoration, reforms, that, were, enacted, in, japan, the, japanese, interest, in, the, reform, of, korea, was, not, purely, altruistic, not, only, would, these, reforms, enable, korea, to, resist, foreign, intrusion, which, was, in, japan, s, direct, interest, but, through, being, a, conduit, of, change, they, would, also, have, opportunity, to, play, a, larger, role, on, the, peninsula, to, meiji, leaders, the, issue, was, not, whether, korea, should, be, reformed, but, how, these, reforms, might, be, implemented, there, was, a, choice, of, adopting, a, passive, role, which, required, the, cultivation, of, reformist, elements, within, korean, society, and, rendering, them, assistance, whenever, possible, or, adopting, a, more, aggressive, policy, actively, interfering, in, korean, politics, to, assure, that, reform, took, place, many, japanese, advocates, of, korean, reform, swung, between, these, two, positions, japan, in, the, early, 1880s, was, weak, as, a, result, of, internal, peasant, uprisings, and, samurai, rebellions, during, the, previous, decade, the, country, was, also, struggling, financially, with, inflation, as, a, result, of, these, internal, factors, subsequently, the, meiji, government, adopted, a, passive, policy, encouraging, the, korean, court, to, follow, the, japanese, model, but, offering, little, concrete, assistance, except, for, the, dispatch, of, the, small, military, mission, headed, by, lieutenant, horimoto, reizo, to, train, the, py, lgigun, what, worried, the, japanese, was, the, chinese, who, had, loosened, their, hold, over, korea, in, 1876, when, the, japanese, succeeded, in, establishing, a, legal, basis, for, korean, independence, by, ending, its, tributary, status, chinese, actions, appeared, to, be, thwarting, the, forces, of, reform, in, korea, and, re, asserting, their, influence, over, the, country, in, 1882, the, korean, peninsula, experienced, a, severe, drought, which, led, to, food, shortages, causing, much, hardship, and, discord, among, the, population, korea, was, on, the, verge, of, bankruptcy, even, falling, months, behind, on, military, pay, causing, deep, resentment, among, the, soldiers, there, was, also, resentment, towards, the, py, lgigun, on, the, part, of, the, soldiers, of, the, regular, korean, army, as, the, formation, was, better, equipped, and, treated, additionally, more, than, 1000, soldiers, had, been, discharged, in, the, process, of, overhauling, the, army, most, of, them, were, either, old, or, disabled, and, the, rest, had, not, been, given, their, pay, in, rice, for, thirteen, months, in, june, of, that, year, king, gojong, being, informed, of, the, situation, ordered, that, a, month, s, allowance, of, rice, be, given, to, the, soldiers, he, directed, min, gyeom, ho, the, overseer, of, government, finances, and, queen, min, s, nephew, to, handle, the, matter, min, in, turn, handed, the, matter, over, to, his, steward, who, sold, the, good, rice, he, had, been, given, and, used, the, money, to, buy, millet, which, he, mixed, with, sand, and, bran, as, a, result, the, rice, became, rotten, and, inedible, the, distribution, of, the, alleged, rice, infuriated, the, soldiers, on, july, 23, a, military, mutiny, and, riot, broke, out, in, seoul, enraged, soldiers, headed, for, the, residence, of, min, gyeom, ho, who, they, had, suspected, of, having, swindled, them, out, of, their, rice, min, on, hearing, word, of, the, revolt, ordered, the, police, to, arrest, some, of, the, ringleaders, and, announced, that, they, would, be, executed, the, next, morning, he, had, assumed, that, this, would, serve, as, a, warning, to, the, other, agitators, however, after, learning, what, had, transpired, the, rioters, broke, into, min, s, house, to, take, vengeance, as, he, was, not, at, his, residence, the, rioters, vented, their, frustrations, by, destroying, his, furniture, and, other, possessions, the, rioters, then, moved, on, to, an, armory, from, which, they, stole, weapons, and, ammunition, and, then, headed, for, the, prison, after, overpowering, the, guards, they, released, not, only, the, men, who, had, been, arrested, that, day, by, min, gyeom, ho, but, also, many, political, prisoners, as, well, min, then, summoned, the, army, to, quell, the, rebellion, but, it, had, become, too, late, to, suppress, the, mutiny, the, original, body, of, mutineers, had, been, swelled, by, the, poor, and, disaffected, citizenry, of, the, city, as, a, result, the, revolt, had, assumed, major, proportions, the, rioters, now, turned, their, attention, to, the, japanese, one, group, headed, to, lieutenant, horimoto, s, quarters, and, killed, him, another, group, some, 3, 000, strong, headed, for, the, japanese, legation, where, hanabusa, yoshitada, the, minister, to, korea, and, twenty, seven, members, of, the, legation, resided, the, mob, surrounded, the, legation, shouting, its, intention, of, killing, all, the, japanese, inside, hanabusa, gave, orders, to, burn, the, legation, and, important, documents, were, set, on, fire, as, the, flames, quickly, spread, the, members, of, the, legation, escaped, through, a, rear, gate, where, they, fled, to, the, harbor, and, boarded, a, boat, which, took, them, down, the, han, river, to, chemulpo, taking, refuge, with, the, incheon, commandant, they, were, again, forced, to, flee, after, word, arrived, of, the, events, in, seoul, and, the, attitude, of, their, hosts, changed, they, escaped, to, the, harbor, during, heavy, rain, and, were, pursued, by, korean, soldiers, six, japanese, were, killed, while, another, five, were, seriously, wounded, the, survivors, carrying, the, wounded, then, boarded, a, small, boat, and, headed, for, the, open, sea, where, three, days, later, they, were, rescued, by, a, british, survey, ship, hms, flying, fish, which, took, them, to, nagasaki, the, following, day, after, the, attack, on, the, japanese, legation, the, rioters, forced, their, way, into, the, royal, palace, where, they, found, and, killed, min, gyeom, ho, as, well, as, a, dozen, other, high, ranking, officers, they, also, searched, for, queen, min, the, queen, narrowly, escaped, however, dressed, as, an, ordinary, lady, of, the, court, and, was, carried, on, the, back, of, a, faithful, guard, who, claimed, she, was, his, sister, the, daewongun, used, the, incident, to, reassert, his, power, the, chinese, then, deployed, about, 4, 500, troops, to, korea, under, general, wu, changqing, which, effectively, regained, control, and, quelled, the, rebellion, in, response, the, japanese, also, sent, four, warships, and, a, battalion, of, troops, to, seoul, to, safeguard, japanese, interests, and, demand, reparations, however, tensions, subsided, with, the, treaty, of, chemulpo, signed, on, the, evening, of, august, 30, 1882, the, agreement, specified, that, the, korean, conspirators, would, be, punished, and, 50, 000, would, be, paid, to, the, families, of, slain, japanese, the, japanese, government, would, also, receive, 500, 000, a, formal, apology, and, permission, to, station, troops, at, their, diplomatic,

he, was, later, carried, off, to, a, town, about, sixty, miles, southwest, of, beijing, where, for, three, years, he, was, confined, to, one, room, and, kept, under, strict, surveillance, after, the, imo, incident, early, reform, efforts, in, korea, suffered, a, major, setback, in, the, aftermath, of, the, incident, the, chinese, reasserted, their, influence, over, the, peninsula, where, they, began, to, interfere, in, korean, internal, affairs, directly, after, stationing, troops, at, strategic, points, in, the, capital, seoul, the, chinese, undertook, several, initiatives, to, gain, significant, influence, over, the, korean, government, the, qing, dispatched, two, special, advisers, on, foreign, affairs, representing, chinese, interests, to, korea, the, german, paul, georg, von, m, llendorff, a, close, confidant, of, li, hongzhang, and, the, chinese, diplomat, ma, jianzhong, a, staff, of, chinese, officers, also, took, over, the, training, of, the, army, providing, the, koreans, with, 1, 000, rifles, two, cannons, and, 10, 000, rounds, of, ammunition, furthermore, the, chingunyeong, capital, guards, command, a, new, korean, military, formation, was, created, and,

right, to, conduct, overland, and, maritime, business, freely, within, its, borders, it, also, gave, the, chinese, advantages, over, the, japanese, and, westerners, and, granted, them, unilateral, extraterritoriality, privileges, in, civil, and, criminal, cases, under, the, treaty, the, number, of, chinese, merchants, and, traders, significantly, increased, a, severe, blow, to, korean, merchants, although, it, allowed, koreans, reciprocally, to, trade, in, beijing, the, agreement, was, not, a, treaty, but, was, in, effect, issued, as, a, regulation, for, a, vassal, additionally, during, the, following, year, the, chinese, supervised, the, creation, of, a, korean, maritime, customs, service, headed, by, von, m, llendorff, korea, was, reduced, to, a, semi, colonial, tributary, state, of, china, with, king, gojong, unable, to, appoint, diplomats, without, chinese, approval, and, with, troops, stationed, in, the, country, to, protect, chinese, interests, china, also, obtained, concessions, in, korea, notably, the, chinese, concession, of, incheon, during, the, 1880s, two, rival, factions, emerged, in, korea, one, was, a, small, group, of, reformers, that, had, centered, around, the, gaehwadang, enlightenment, party, which, had, become, frustrated, at, the, limited, scale, and, arbitrary, pace, of, reforms, the, members, who, constituted, the, enlightenment, party, were, well, educated, koreans, and, most, were, from, the, yangban, class, they, were, impressed, by, the, developments, in, meiji, japan, and, were, eager, to, emulate, them, members, included, kim, ok, gyun, pak, yung, hio, hong, yeong, sik, seo, gwang, beom, and, soh, jaipil, the, group, was, also, relatively, young, pak, yung, hio, came, from, a, prestigious, lineage, related, to, the, royal, family, and, was, 23, hong, was, 29, seo, gwang, beom, was, 25, and, soh, jaipil, was, 20, with, kim, ok, gyun, being, the, oldest, at, 33, all, had, spent, some, time, in, japan, pak, yung, hio, had, been, part, of, a, mission, sent, to, japan, to, apologize, for, the, imo, incident, in, 1882, he, had, been, accompanied, by, seo, gwang, beom, and, by, kim, ok, gyun, who, later, came, under, the, influence, of, japanese, modernizers, such, as, fukuzawa, yukichi, kim, ok, gyun, while, studying, in, japan, had, also, cultivated, friendships, with, influential, japanese, figures, and, became, the, de, facto, leader, of, the, group, they, were, also, strongly, nationalistic, and, desired, to, make, their, country, truly, independent, by, ending, chinese, interference, in, korea, s, internal, affairs, the, sadaedang, was, a, group, of, conservatives, which, included, not, only, min, yeong, ik, from, the, min, family, but, also, other, prominent, korean, political, figures, that, wanted, to, maintain, power, with, china, s, help, although, the, members, of, the, sadaedang, supported, the, enlightenment, policy, they, favored, gradual, changes, based, on, the, chinese, model, after, the, imo, incident, the, min, clan, pursued, a, pro, chinese, policy, this, was, also, partly, a, matter, of, opportunism, as, the, intervention, by, chinese, troops, led, to, subsequent, exile, of, the, rival, daewongun, in, tianjin, and, the, expansion, of, chinese, influence, in, korea, but, it, also, reflected, an, ideological, disposition, shared, by, many, koreans, toward, the, more, comfortable, and, traditional, relationship, as, a, tributary, of, china, consequently, the, min, clan, became, advocates, of, the, dongdo, seogi, adopting, western, knowledge, while, keeping, eastern, values, philosophy, which, had, originated, from, the, ideas, of, moderate, chinese, reformers, who, had, emphasized, the, need, to, maintain, the, perceived, superior, cultural, values, and, heritage, of, the, sino, centric, world, while, recognizing, the, importance, of, acquiring, and, adopting, western, technology, particularly, military, technology, in, order, to, preserve, autonomy, hence, rather, than, major, institutional, reforms, such, as, the, adoption, of, new, values, such, as, legal, equality, or, introducing, modern, education, like, in, meiji, japan, the, advocates, of, this, school, of, thought, sought, piecemeal, adoptions, of, institutions, that, would, strengthen, the, state, while, preserving, the, basic, social, political, and, cultural, order, through, the, ascendancy, of, queen, min, to, the, throne, the, min, clan, had, also, been, able, to, use, newly, created, government, institutions, as, bases, for, political, power, subsequently, with, their, growing, monopoly, of, key, positions, they, frustrated, the, ambitions, of, the, enlightenment, party, in, the, two, years, preceding, the, imo, incident, the, members, of, the, gaehwadang, had, failed, to, secure, appointments, to, vital, offices, in, the, government, and, were, unable, to, implement, their, reform, plans, as, a, consequence, they, were, prepared, to, seize, power, by, any, means, necessary, in, 1884, an, opportunity, to, seize, power, by, staging, a, coup, d, tat, against, the, sadaedang, presented, itself, in, august, as, hostilities, between, france, and, china, erupted, over, annam, half, of, the, chinese, troops, stationed, in, korea, were, withdrawn, on, december, 4, 1884, with, the, help, of, japanese, minister, takezoe, shinichiro, who, promised, to, mobilize, japanese, legation, guards, to, provide, assistance, the, reformers, staged, their, coup, under, the, guise, of, a, banquet, hosted, by, hong, yeong, sik, the, director, of, the, general, postal, administration, the, banquet, was, to, celebrate, the, opening, of, the, new, national, post, office, king, gojong, was, expected, to, attend, together, with, several, foreign, diplomats, and, high, ranking, officials, most, of, whom, were, members, of, the, pro, chinese, sadaedang, faction, kim, ok, gyun, and, his, comrades, approached, king, gojong, falsely, stating, that, chinese, troops, had, created, a, disturbance, and, escorted, him, to, the, small, gyoengu, palace, where, they, placed, him, in, the, custody, of, japanese, legation, guards, they, then, proceeded, to, kill, and, wound, several, senior, officials, of, the, sadaedang, faction, after, the, coup, the, gaehwadang, members, formed, a, new, government, and, devised, a, program, of, reform, the, radical, 14, point, reform, proposal, stated, that, the, following, conditions, be, met, an, end, to, korea, s, tributary, relationship, with, china, the, abolition, of, ruling, class,

development, of, free, commerce, and, trade, the, creation, of, a, modern, police, system, including, police, patrols, and, royal, guards, and, severe, punishment, of, corrupt, officials, however, the, new, government, lasted, no, longer, than, a, few, days, this, was, possibly, inevitable, as, the, reformers, were, supported, by, no, more, than, 140, japanese, troops, who, faced, at, least, 1, 500, chinese, garrisoned, in, seoul, under, the, command, of, general, yuan, shikai, with, the, reform, measures, being, a, threat, to, her, clan, s, power, queen, min, secretly, requested, military, intervention, from, the, chinese, consequently, within, three, days, even, before, the, reform, measures, were, made, public, the, coup, was, suppressed, by, chinese, troops, who, attacked, and, defeated, the, japanese, forces, and, restored, power, to, the, pro, chinese, sadaedang, faction, during, the, ensuing, melee, hong, yeong, sik, was, killed, the, japanese, legation, building, was, burned, down, and, forty, japanese, were, killed, the, surviving, korean, coup, leaders, including, kim, ok, gyun, escaped, to, the, port, of, chemulpo, under, escort, of, the, japanese, minister, takezoe, from, there, they, boarded, a, japanese, ship, for, exile, in, japan, in, january, 1885, with, a, show, of, force, the, japanese, dispatched, two, battalions, and, seven, warships, to, korea, which, resulted, in, the, japan, korea, treaty, of, 1885, signed, on, 9, january, 1885, the, treaty, restored, diplomatic, relations, between, japan, and, korea, the, koreans, also, agreed, to, pay, the, japanese, 100, 000, for, damages, to, their, legation, and, to, provide, a, site, for, the, building, of, a, new, legation, prime, minister, ito, hirobumi, in, order, to, overcome, japan, s, disadvantageous, position, in, korea, followed, by, the, abortive, coup, visited, china, to, discuss, the, matter, with, his, chinese, counterpart, li, hongzhang, the, two, parties, succeeded, in, concluding, the, convention, of, tianjin, on, may, 31, 1885, they, also, pledged, to, withdraw, their, troops, from, korea, within, four, months, with, prior, notification, to, the, other, if, troops, were, to, be, sent, to, korea, in, the, future, after, both, countries, withdrew, their, forces, they, left, behind, a, precarious, balance, of, power, on, the, korean, peninsula, between, the, two, nations, meanwhile, yuan, shikai, remained, in, seoul, appointed, as, the, chinese, resident, and, continued, to, interfere, with, korean, domestic, politics, the, failure, of, the, coup, also, marked, a, dramatic, decline, in, japanese, influence, over, korea, the, nagasaki, incident, was, a, riot, that, took, place, in, the, japanese, port, city, of, nagasaki, in, 1886, four, warships, from, the, qing, empire, s, navy, the, beiyang, fleet, stopped, at, nagasaki, apparently, to, carry, out, repairs, some, chinese, sailors, caused, trouble, in, the, city, and, started, the, riot, several, japanese, policemen, confronting, the, rioters, were, killed, the, qing, government, did, not, apologize, after, the, incident, which, resulted, in, a, wave, of, anti, chinese, sentiment, in, japan, a, poor, harvest, in, 1889, led, the, governor, of, korea, s, hamgyong, province, to, prohibit, soybean, exports, to, japan, japan, requested, and, received, compensation, in, 1893, for, their, importers, the, incident, highlighted, the, growing, dependence, japan, felt, on, korean, food, imports, on, march, 28, 1894, a, pro, japanese, korean, revolutionary, kim, ok, gyun, was, assassinated, in, shanghai, kim, had, fled, to, japan, after, his, involvement, in, the, 1884, coup, and, the, japanese, had, turned, down, korean, demands, for, him, to, be, extradited, many, japanese, activists, saw, in, him, potential, for, a, future, role, in, korean, modernization, however, meiji, government, leaders, were, more, cautious, after, some, reservations, they, exiled, him, to, the, bonin, ogasawara, islands, ultimately, he, was, lured, to, shanghai, where, he, was, killed, by, a, korean, hong, jong, u, in, his, room, at, a, japanese, inn, in, the, international, settlement, after, some, hesitation, the, british, authorities, in, shanghai, concluded, that, rules, against, extradition, did, not, apply, to, a, corpse, and, turned, his, body, over, to, chinese, authorities, his, body, was, then, taken, aboard, a, chinese, warship, and, sent, back, to, korea, where, it, was, cut, up, by, the, korean, authorities, quartered, and, displayed, in, all, korean, provinces, as, a, warning, to, other, purported, rebels, and, traitors, in, tokyo, the, japanese, government, took, that, as, an, outrageous, affront, kim, ok, gyun, s, brutal, murder, was, portrayed, as, a, betrayal, by, li, hongzhang, and, a, setback, for, japan, s, stature, and, dignity, the, chinese, authorities, refused, to, press, charges, against, the, assassin, and, he, was, even, allowed, to, accompany, kim, s, mutilated, body, back, to, korea, where, he, was, showered, with, rewards, and, honors, kim, s, assassination, had, also, called, japan, s, commitment, to, its, korean, supporters, into, question, the, police, in, tokyo, had, foiled, an, earlier, attempt, during, the, same, year, to, assassinate, pak, yung, hio, one, of, the, other, korean, leaders, of, the, 1884, uprising, when, two, suspected, korean, assassins, received, asylum, at, the, korean, legation, that, had, instigated, a, diplomatic, outrage, as, well, although, the, japanese, government, could, have, immediately, used, kim, s, assassination, to, its, advantage, it, concluded, that, since, kim, had, died, on, chinese, territory, the, treatment, of, the, corpse, was, outside, its, authority, however, the, shocking, murder, of, the, korean, inflamed, japanese, opinion, since, many, japanese, considered, the, chinese, supported, actions, to, be, directed, against, japan, as, well, to, the, japanese, the, chinese, had, also, showed, their, contempt, for, international, law, when, they, set, free, the, suspected, assassin, who, had, been, arrested, by, british, authorities, in, shanghai, and, then, in, accordance, with, treaty, obligations, turned, over, to, the, chinese, for, trial, nationalistic, groups, immediately, began, to, call, for, war, with, china, tensions, ran, high, between, china, and, japan, but, war, was, not, yet, inevitable, and, the, fury, in, japan, over, kim, s, assassination, began, to, dissipate, however, in, late, april, the, donghak, rebellion, erupted, in, korea, korean, peasants, rose, up, in, open, rebellion, against, oppressive, taxation, and, incompetent, financial, administration, of, the, joseon, government, it, was, the, largest, peasant, rebellion, in, korean, history, however, on, june, 1, rumors, reached, the, donghaks, that, the, chinese, and, japanese, were, on, the, verge, of, sending, troops, and, so, the, rebels, agreed, to, a, ceasefire, to, remove, any, grounds, for, foreign, intervention, on, june, 2, the, japanese, cabinet, decided, to, send, troops, to, korea, if, china, did, the, same, in, may, the, chinese, had, taken, steps, to, prepare, for, the, mobilization, of, their, forces, in, the, provinces, of, zhili, shandong, and, in, manchuria, as, a, result, of, the, tense, situation, on, the, korean, peninsula, however, those, actions, were, planned, more, as, an, armed, demonstration, to, strengthen, the, chinese, position, in, korea, than, as, preparation, for, war, against, japan, on, june, 3, king, gojong, on, the, recommendation, of, the, min, clan, and, at, the, insistence, of, yuan, shikai, requested, aid, from, the, chinese, government, in, suppressing, the, donghak, rebellion, although, the, rebellion, was, not, as, serious, as, it, had, initially, seemed, and, so, the, chinese, forces, were, not, necessary, the, decision, was, made, to, send, 2, 500, men, under, the, command, of, general, ye, zhichao, to, the, harbor, of, asan, about, 70, km, 43, mi, from, seoul, the, troops, destined, for, korea, sailed, on, board, three, british, owned, steamers, chartered, by, the, chinese, government, arriving, at, asan, on, june, 9, on, june, 25, a, further, 400, troops, had, arrived, consequently, by, the, end, of, june, ye, zhichao, had, about, 2, 800, 2, 900, soldiers, under, his, command, at, asan, closely, watching, the, events, on, the, peninsula, the, japanese, government, had, quickly, become, convinced, that, the, rebellion, would, lead, to, chinese, intervention, in, korea, as, a, result, soon, after, learning, of, the, korean, government, s, request, for, chinese, military, help, all, japanese, warships, in, the, vicinity, were, immediately, ordered, to, pusan, and, chemulpo, by, june, 9, japanese, warships, had, consecutively, called, at, chemulpo, and, pusan, a, formation, of, 420, sailors, selected, from, the, crews, of, warships, anchored, in, chempulo, was, immediately, dispatched, to, seoul, where, they, served, as, a, temporary, counterbalance, to, the, chinese, troops, camped, at, asan, simultaneously, a, reinforced, brigade, of, approximately, 8, 000, troops, the, oshima, composite, brigade, under, the, command, of, general, shima, yoshimasa, was, also, dispatched, to, chemulpo, by, june, 27, according, to, the, japanese, the, chinese, government, had, violated, the, convention, of, tientsin, by, not, informing, the, japanese, government, of, its, decision, to, send, troops, but, the, chinese, claimed, that, japan, had, approved, the, decision, the, japanese, countered, by, sending, an, expeditionary, force, to, korea, the, first, 400, troops, arrived, on, june, 9, en, route, to, seoul, and, 3, 000, landed, at, incheon, on, june, 12, however, japanese, officials, denied, any, intention, to, intervene, as, a, result, the, qing, viceroy, li, hongzhang, was, lured, into, believing, that, japan, would, not, wage, war, but, the, japanese, were, fully, prepared, to, act, the, qing, government, turned, down, japan, s, suggestion, for, japan, and, china, to, co, operate, to, reform, the, korean, government, when, korea, demanded, that, japan, withdraw, its, troops, from, korea, the, japanese, refused, in, july, 1894, the, 8, 000, japanese, troops, captured, the, korean, king, gojong, and, occupied, the, gyeongbokgung, in, seoul, by, july, 25, they, had, replaced, the, existing, korean, government, with, members, of, the, pro, japanese, faction, even, though, qing, forces, were, already, leaving, korea, after, they, found, themselves, unneeded, there, the, new, pro, japanese, korean, government, granted, japan, the, right, to, expel, qing, forces, and, japan, dispatched, more, troops, to, korea, the, qing, empire, rejected, the, new, korean, government, as, illegitimate, japanese, reforms, under, the, meiji, government, gave, significant, priority, to, the, creation, of, an, effective, modern, national, army, and, navy, especially, naval, construction, japan, sent, numerous, military, officials, abroad, for, training, and, evaluation, of, the, relative, strengths, and, tactics, of, western, armies, and, navies, the, imperial, japanese, navy, was, modeled, after, the, british, royal, navy, at, the, time, the, foremost, naval, power, british, advisors, were, sent, to, japan, to, train, the, naval, establishment, while, japanese, students, were, in, turn, sent, to, britain, to, study, and, observe, the, royal, navy, through, drilling, and, tuition, by, royal, navy, instructors, japan, developed, naval, officers, expert, in, the, arts, of, gunnery, and, seamanship, at, the, start, of, hostilities, the, imperial, japanese, navy, was, composed, of, a, fleet, of, 12, modern, warships, the, protected, cruiser, izumi, being, added, during, the, war, eight, corvettes, one, ironclad, warship, 26, torpedo, boats, and, numerous, auxiliary, armed, merchant, cruisers, and, converted, liners, during, peacetime, the, warships, of, the, imperial, japanese, navy, were, divided, among, three, main, naval, bases, at, yokosuka, kure, and, sasebo, and, following, mobilization, the, navy, was, composed, of, five, divisions, of, seagoing, warships, and, three, flotillas, of, torpedo, boats, with, a, fourth, being, formed, at, the, beginning, of, hostilities, the, japanese, also, had, a, relatively, large, merchant, navy, which, at, the, beginning, of, 1894, consisted, of, 288, vessels, of, these, 66, belonged, to, the, nippon, yusen, kaisha, shipping, company, which, received, national, subsidies, from, the, japanese, government, to, maintain, the, vessels, for, use, by, the, navy, in, time, of, war, as, a, consequence, the, navy, could, call, on, a, sufficient, number, of, auxiliaries, and, transports, japan, did, not, yet, have, the, resources, to, acquire, battleships, and, so, planned, to, employ, the, jeune, cole, doctrine, which, favoured, small, fast, warships, especially, cruisers, and, torpedo, boats, with, the, offensive, capability, to, destroy, larger, craft, the, japanese, naval, leadership, on, the, eve, of, hostilities, was, generally, cautious, and, even, apprehensive, as, the, navy, had, not, yet, received, the, warships, ordered, in, february, 1893, particularly, the, battleships, fuji, and, yashima, and, the, protected, cruiser, akashi, hence, initiating, hostilities, at, the, time, was, not, ideal, and, the, navy, was, far, less, confident, than, the, army, about, the, outcome, of, a, war, with, china, many, of, japan, s, major, warships, were, built, in, british, and, french, shipyards, eight, british, three, french, and, two, japanese, built, and, 16, of, the, torpedo, boats, were, known, to, have, been, built, in, france, and, assembled, in, japan, the, meiji, government, at, first, modeled, their, army, after, the, french, army, french, advisers, had, been, sent, to, japan, with, two, military, missions, in, 1872, 1880, and, 1884, in, addition, to, one, mission, under, the, shogunate, nationwide, conscription, was, enforced, in, 1873, and, a, western, style, conscript, army, was, established, military, schools, and, arsenals, were, also, built, in, 1886, japan, turned, toward, the, german, prussian, model, as, the, basis, for, its, army, adopting, german, doctrines, and, the, german, military, system, and, organisation, in, 1885, jacob, meckel, a, german, adviser, implemented, new, measures, such, as, the, reorganization, of, the, command, structure, into, divisions, and, regiments, the, strengthening, of, army, logistics, transportation, and, structures, thereby, increasing, mobility, and, the, establishment, of, artillery, and, engineering, regiments, as, independent, commands, it, was, also, an, army, that, was, equal, to, european, armed, forces, in, every, respect, on, the, eve, of, the, outbreak, of, the, war, with, china, all, men, between, the, ages, of, 17, and, 40, years, were, eligible, for, conscription, but, only, those, who, turned, 20, were, to, be, drafted, while, those, who, had, turned, 17, could, volunteer, all, men, between, the, ages, of, 17, and, 40, even, those, who, had, not, received, military, training, or, were, physically, unfit, were, considered, part, of, the, territorial, militia, or, national, guard, kokumin, following, the, period, of, active, military, service, gen, eki, which, lasted, for, three, years, the, soldiers, became, part, of, the, first, reserve, y, bi, numbering, 92, 000, in, 1893, and, then, the, second, reserve, k, bi, numbering, 106, 000, in, 1893, all, young, and, able, bodied, men, who, did, not, receive, basic, military, training, due, to, exceptions, and, those, conscripts, who, had, not, fully, met, the, physical, requirements, of, military, service, became, third, reserve, hoj, in, time, of, war, the, first, reserve, y, bi, were, to, be, called, up, first, and, they, were, intended, to, fill, the, ranks, of, the, regular, army, units, next, to, be, called, up, were, the, k, bi, reserve, who, were, to, be, either, used, to, further, fill, in, the, ranks, of, line, units, or, to, be, formed, into, new, ones, the, hoj, reserve, members, were, to, be, called, up, only, in, exceptional, circumstances, and, the, territorial, militia, or, national, guard, would, only, be, called, up, in, case, of, an, immediate, enemy, attack, on, or, invasion, of, japan, the, country, was, divided, into, six, military, districts, headquarters, tokyo, osaka, nagoya, sendai, hiroshima, and, kumamoto, with, each, being, a, recruitment, area, for, a, square, infantry, division, consisting, of, two, brigades, of, two, regiments, each, of, these, divisions, contained, approximately, 18, 600, troops, and, 36, artillery, pieces, when, mobilized, there, was, also, an, imperial, guard, division, which, recruited, nationally, from, all, around, japan, this, division, was, also, composed, of, two, brigades, but, had, instead, two, battalion, not, three, battalion, regiments, consequently, its, numerical, strength, after, mobilization, was, 12, 500, troops, and, 24, artillery, pieces, in, addition, there, were, fortress, troops, consisting, of, approximately, six, battalions, the, colonial, corps, of, about, 4, 000, troops, which, was, stationed, on, hokkaido, and, the, ryukyu, islands, and, a, battalion, of, military, police, in, each, of, the, districts, in, peacetime, the, regular, army, had, a, total, of, fewer, than, 70, 000, men, while, after, mobilization, the, numbers, rose, to, over, 220, 000, moreover, the, army, still, had, a, trained, reserve, which, following, the, mobilization, of, the, first, line, divisions, could, be, formed, into, reserve, brigades, these, reserve, brigades, each, consisted, of, four, battalions, a, cavalry, unit, a, company, of, engineers, an, artillery, battery, and, rear, echelon, units, they, were, to, serve, as, recruiting, bases, for, their, front, line, divisions, and, could, also, perform, secondary, combat, operations, and, if, necessary, they, could, be, expanded, into, full, divisions, with, a, total, of, 24, territorial, force, regiments, however, formation, of, these, units, was, hindered, by, a, lack, of, sufficient, amounts, of, equipment, especially, uniforms, japanese, troops, were, equipped, with, the, 8, mm, single, shot, murata, type, 18, breech, loading, rifle, the, improved, eight, round, magazine, type, 22, was, just, being, introduced, and, consequently, in, 1894, on, the, eve, of, the, war, only, the, imperial, guard, and, 4th, division, were, equipped, with, these, rifles, the, division, artillery, consisted, of, 75, mm, field, guns, and, mountain, pieces, manufactured, in, osaka, the, artillery, was, based, on, krupp, designs, that, were, adapted, by, the, italians, at, the, beginning, of, the, 1880s, although, it, could, hardly, be, described, as, modern, in, 1894, in, general, it, still, matched, contemporary, battlefield, requirements, by, the, 1890s, japan, had, at, its, disposal, a, modern, professionally, trained, western, style, army, which, was, relatively, well, equipped, and, supplied, its, officers, had, studied, in, europe, and, were, well, educated, in, the, latest, strategy, and, tactics, by, the, start, of, the, war, the, imperial, japanese, army, could, field, a, total, force, of, 120, 000, men, in, two, armies, and, five, divisions, the, japanese, army, despite, the, integration, of, supply, troops, into, its, divisions, was, unable, to, rely, on, its, pre, existing, logistical, system, and, personnel, to, sustain, its, armies, in, the, field, with, 153, 000, labourers, contractors, and, drivers, being, contracted, to, sustain, the, armies, in, the, field, supply, issues, and, a, general, lack, of, preparedness, for, a, sustained, war, would, routinely, delay, operations, and, slow, down, the, japanese, field, armies, as, seen, in, the, yingkou, campaign, troops, often, had, to, forage, or, steal, from, the, local, populace, and, medicine, and, winter, clothing, was, often, in, short, supply, during, the, latter, stages, of, the, war, the, japanese, army, also, possessed, a, large, amount, of, coastal, guns, at, key, locations, which, could, be, used, for, siege, operations, these, weapons, were, as, follows, the, prevailing, view, in, many, western, circles, was, that, the, modernized, chinese, military, would, crush, the, japanese, observers, commended, chinese, units, such, as, the, huai, army, and, beiyang, fleet, the, german, general, staff, predicted, a, japanese, defeat, and, william, lang, who, was, a, british, advisor, to, the, chinese, military, praised, chinese, training, ships, guns, and, fortifications, stating, that, in, the, end, there, is, no, doubt, that, japan, must, be, utterly, crushed, the, qing, dynasty, did, not, have, a, unified, national, army, but, was, made, up, of, three, main, components, with, the, so, called, eight, banners, forming, the, elite, the, eight, banners, forces, were, segregated, along, ethnic, lines, into, separate, manchu, han, chinese, mongol, hui, muslim, and, other, ethnic, formations, bannermen, who, made, up, the, eight, banners, got, higher, pay, than, the, rest, of, the, army, while, the, manchu, received, further, privileges, in, total, there, were, 250, 000, soldiers, in, the, eight, banners, with, over, 60, percent, kept, in, garrisons, in, beijing, while, the, remaining, 40, percent, served, as, garrison, troops, in, other, major, chinese, cities, the, green, standard, army, was, a, 600, 000, strong, gendarmerie, type, force, that, was, recruited, from, the, majority, han, chinese, population, its, soldiers, were, not, given, any, peacetime, basic, military, training, but, were, expected, to, fight, in, any, conflict, the, third, component, was, an, irregular, force, called, the, braves, which, were, used, as, a, kind, of, reserve, force, for, the, regular, army, and, which, were, usually, recruited, from, the, more, distant, or, remote, provinces, of, china, they, were, formed, into, very, loosely, organized, units, from, the, same, province, the, braves, were, sometimes, described, as, mercenaries, with, their, volunteers, receiving, as, much, military, training, as, their, commanders, saw, fit, with, no, fixed, unit, organization, it, is, impossible, to, know, how, many, battle, ready, braves, there, actually, were, in, 1894, there, were, also, a, few, other, military, formations, one, of, which, was, the, huai, army, which, was, under, the, personal, authority, of, li, hongzhang, and, was, created, originally, to, suppress, the, taiping, rebellion, 1850, 1864, the, huai, army, had, received, limited, training, by, western, military, advisors, numbering, nearly, 45, 000, troops, it, was, considered, the, best, armed, military, unit, in, china, however, there, is, no, definitive, estimate, for, the, size, of, the, qing, armies, in, this, war, and, scholarly, estimates, vary, widely, 100, 000, actual, huai, army, 69, 800, 450, 000, 600, 000, actual, 175, 000, paper, 13, 500, actual, 61, 200, 1, 091, 150, does, not, distinguish, between, the, two, armies, the, japanese, imperial, general, staff, estimated, that, they, would, face, no, more, than, 350, 000, effective, chinese, soldiers, this, corresponds, well, with, the, estimate, of, the, board, of, war, from, 1898, which, states, that, the, total, of, the, provincial, militia, defense, army, yong, ying, disciplined, army, modernised, green, standard, and, new, style, forces, organised, after, the, war, was, approximately, 360, 000, du, boulay, confirms, this, with, the, total, army, strength, of, the, army, in, zhili, shandong, and, manchuria, amounting, to, 357, 100, zhili, shandong, and, manchuria, and, 1, 000, 000, total, trained, men, in, the, empire, troops, due, to, various, factors, such, as, the, limited, transport, capacity, the, absence, of, any, railway, in, the, combat, zone, provincial, infighting, and, a, general, lack, of, capacity, for, accommodating, soldiers, only, a, small, portion, of, the, army, that, could, be, fielded, was, actually, deployed, even, forces, that, were, mobilised, including, the, strong, hunan, forces, of, liu, kunyi, they, were, not, able, to, arrive, in, time, to, make, a, meaningful, difference, this, meant, that, the, fighting, primarily, fell, on, the, forces, already, in, zhili, shandong, and, manchuria, this, was, a, similar, situation, as, what, occurred, in, the, opium, wars, as, the, much, larger, chinese, army, found, itself, outnumbered, in, those, conflicts, as, it, did, this, one, chinese, forces, were, also, far, behind, the, japanese, in, terms, of, support, services, there, was, a, complete, absence, of, engineers, quartermasters, transportation, signal, and, medical, troops, hired, labour, coolies, often, performed, transportation, duties, and, rudimentary, engineering, tasks, supply, was, organised, by, the, province, where, the, soldiers, were, fighting, and, left, to, civilian, officials, assigned, as, quartermasters, and, a, few, doctors, were, attached, to, the, army, at, the, rear, this, lack, of, adequate, supply, organisation, led, to, some, units, receiving, the, wrong, ammunition, for, their, rifles, on, the, presumption, they, possessed, rifles, the, basic, tactical, unit, of, the, chinese, army, was, the, battalion, ying, composed, on, paper, of, 500, men, though, in, reality, actual, strength, was, 350, for, the, infantry, and, 250, for, the, cavalry, up, to, a, dozen, of, these, ying, would, form, an, independent, corps, and, only, at, a, corps, level, did, chinese, units, receive, artillery, although, the, chinese, had, established, arsenals, to, produce, firearms, and, a, large, number, of, them, had, been, imported, from, abroad, 40, percent, of, chinese, troops, at, the, outbreak, of, the, war, were, not, issued, with, rifles, or, even, muskets, instead, they, were, armed, with, a, variety, of, swords, spears, pikes, halberds, and, bows, and, arrows, against, well, trained, well, armed, and, disciplined, japanese, troops, they, would, have, little, chance, those, units, that, did, have, firearms, were, equipped, with, a, heterogeneity, of, weapons, from, a, variety, of, modern, rifles, to, old, fashioned, muskets, this, lack, of, standardization, led, to, a, major, problem, with, the, proper, supply, of, ammunition, chinese, troops, were, often, not, drilled, in, how, to, use, their, guns, with, training, conducted, with, spears, and, when, guns, were, utilised, in, training, the, officer, corps, resistant, to, modern, training, practice, would, conduct, it, at, a, distance, of, 50, ft, instead, of, at, longer, ranges, that, would, be, more, common, in, combat, there, was, also, a, lack, of, discipline, within, the, army, as, troops, would, routinely, flee, before, during, or, after, combat, as, occurred, in, the, battle, of, pyongyang, chinese, artillerymen, likewise, did, not, receive, adequate, training, in, operating, their, artillery, pieces, the, imperial, chinese, army, in, 1894, was, a, heterogeneous, mixture, of, modernized, partly, modernized, and, almost, medieval, units, which, no, commander, could, have, led, successfully, resulting, in, poor, leadership, among, chinese, officers, chinese, officers, did, not, know, how, to, handle, their, troops, and, the, older, higher, ranking, officers, still, believed, that, they, could, fight, a, war, as, they, had, during, the, taiping, rebellion, of, 1850, 1864, this, was, also, the, result, of, the, chinese, military, forces, being, divided, into, largely, independent, regional, commands, the, soldiers, were, drawn, from, diverse, provinces, that, had, no, affinity, with, each, other, chinese, troops, also, suffered, from, poor, morale, largely, because, many, of, the, troops, had, not, been, paid, for, a, long, time, the, low, prestige, of, soldiers, in, chinese, society, also, hindered, morale, and, the, use, of, opium, and, other, narcotics, was, rife, throughout, the, army, low, morale, and, poor, leadership, seriously, reduced, the, effectiveness, of, chinese, troops, and, contributed, to, defeats, such, as, the, abandonment, of, the, very, well, fortified, and, defensible, weihaiwei, additionally, military, logistics, were, lacking, as, the, construction, of, railroads, in, manchuria, had, been, discouraged, the, huai, army, troops, also, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, beiyang, army, although, they, were, a, small, minority, in, the, overall, imperial, chinese, army, were, to, take, part, in, the, majority, of, the, fighting, during, the, war, they, were, organized, in, 51, battalions, and, were, estimated, to, number, from, 25, 000, to, 45, 000, the, huai, army, units, that, faced, the, japanese, in, korea, did, have, a, significant, amount, of, modern, weaponry, including, mauser, breech, loading, rifles, that, were, comparable, to, the, murata, rifles, of, the, japanese, and, krupp, artillery, pieces, after, their, defeat, in, korea, the, qing, deployed, additional, forces, to, defend, northeast, china, including, partially, reformed, green, standard, troops, that, were, poorly, equipped, the, beiyang, fleet, was, one, of, the, four, modernised, chinese, navies, in, the, late, qing, dynasty, the, navies, were, heavily, sponsored, by, li, hongzhang, the, viceroy, of, zhili, who, had, also, created, the, huai, army, the, beiyang, fleet, was, the, dominant, navy, in, east, asia, before, the, first, sino, japanese, war, the, japanese, themselves, were, apprehensive, about, facing, the, chinese, fleet, especially, the, two, german, built, battleships, dingyuan, and, zhenyuan, to, which, the, japanese, had, no, comparable, counterparts, however, china, s, advantages, were, more, apparent, than, real, as, most, of, the, chinese, warships, were, over, age, and, obsolescent, the, ships, were, also, not, maintained, properly, and, indiscipline, was, common, among, their, crews, the, greater, armor, of, major, chinese, warships, and, the, greater, weight, of, broadside, they, could, fire, were, more, than, offset, by, the, number, of, quick, firing, guns, on, most, first, line, japanese, warships, which, gave, the, japanese, the, edge, in, any, sustained, exchange, of, salvos, the, worst, feature, of, both, chinese, battleships, was, actually, their, main, armament, each, was, armed, with, short, barreled, guns, in, twin, barbettes, mounted, in, echelon, which, could, fire, only, in, restricted, arcs, the, short, barrels, of, the, chinese, main, armament, meant, that, the, shells, had, a, low, muzzle, velocity, and, poor, penetration, and, their, accuracy, was, also, poor, at, long, ranges, tactically, chinese, naval, vessels, entered, the, war, with, only, the, crudest, set, of, instructions, ships, that, were, assigned, to, designated, pairs, were, to, keep, together, and, all, ships, were, to, fight, end, on, as, far, forward, from, the, beam, as, possible, a, tactic, dictated, by, the, obsolescent, arrangement, of, guns, aboard, chinese, warships, the, only, vague, resemblance, of, a, fleet, tactic, was, that, all, ships, were, to, follow, the, visible, movements, of, the, flagship, an, arrangement, made, necessary, because, the, signal, book, used, by, the, chinese, was, written, in, english, a, language, with, which, few, officers, in, the, beiyang, fleet, had, any, familiarity, when, it, was, first, developed, by, empress, dowager, cixi, in, 1888, the, beiyang, fleet, was, said, to, be, the, strongest, navy, in, east, asia, before, her, adopted, son, emperor, guangxu, took, over, the, throne, in, 1889, cixi, wrote, out, explicit, orders, that, the, navy, should, continue, to, develop, and, expand, gradually, however, after, cixi, went, into, retirement, all, naval, and, military, development, came, to, a, drastic, halt, japan, s, victories, over, china, has, often, been, falsely, rumored, to, be, the, fault, of, cixi, many, believed, that, cixi, was, the, cause, of, the, navy, s, defeat, because, cixi, embezzled, funds, from, the, navy, in, order, to, build, the, summer, palace, in, beijing, however, extensive, research, by, chinese, historians, revealed, that, cixi, was, not, the, cause, of, the, chinese, navy, s, decline, in, actuality, china, s, defeat, was, caused, by, emperor, guangxu, s, lack, of, interest, in, developing, and, maintaining, the, military, his, close, adviser, grand, tutor, weng, tonghe, advised, guangxu, to, cut, all, funding, to, the, navy, and, army, because, he, did, not, see, japan, as, a, true, threat, and, there, were, several, natural, disasters, during, the, early, 1890s, which, the, emperor, thought, to, be, more, pressing, to, expend, funds, on, the, total, strength, of, the, entire, imperial, chinese, navy, was, while, the, qing, empire, was, fighting, the, first, sino, japanese, war, it, was, also, simultaneously, engaging, rebels, in, the, dungan, revolt, in, northwestern, china, where, thousands, lost, their, lives, the, generals, dong, fuxiang, ma, anliang, and, ma, haiyan, were, initially, summoned, by, the, qing, government, to, bring, the, hui, troops, under, their, command, to, participate, in, the, first, sino, japanese, war, but, they, were, eventually, sent, to, suppress, the, dungan, revolt, instead, 1, june, 1894, the, donghak, rebel, army, moves, toward, seoul, the, korean, government, requests, help, from, the, qing, government, to, suppress, the, revolt, 6, june, 1894, about, 2, 465, chinese, soldiers, are, transported, to, korea, to, suppress, the, donghak, rebellion, japan, asserts, that, it, was, not, notified, and, thus, china, has, violated, the, convention, of, tientsin, which, requires, that, china, and, japan, must, notify, each, other, before, intervening, in, korea, china, asserts, that, japan, was, notified, and, approved, of, chinese, intervention, 8, june, 1894, first, of, about, 4,

munemitsu, meets, with, wang, fengzao, the, qing, ambassador, to, japan, to, discuss, the, future, status, of, korea, wang, states, that, the, qing, government, intends, to, pull, out, of, korea, after, the, rebellion, has, been, suppressed, and, expects, japan, to, do, the, same, however, china, retains, a, resident, to, look, after, chinese, primacy, in, korea, 22, june, 1894, additional, japanese, troops, arrive, in, korea, japanese, prime, minister, it, hirobumi, tells, matsukata, masayoshi, that, since, the, qing, empire, appear, to, be, making, military, preparations, there, is,

they, could, only, be, supplied, by, sea, through, asan, bay, the, japanese, objective, was, first, to, blockade, the, chinese, at, asan, and, then, encircle, them, with, their, land, forces, japan, s, initial, strategy, was, to, gain, command, of, the, sea, which, was, critical, to, its, operations, in, korea, command, of, the, sea, would, allow, japan, to, transport, troops, to, the, mainland, the, army, s, fifth, division, would, land, at, chemulpo, on, the, western, coast, of, korea, both, to, engage, and, push, chinese, forces, northwest, up, the, peninsula, and, to, draw, the, beiyang, fleet, into, the, yellow, sea, where, it, would, be, engaged, in, decisive, battle, depending, on, the, outcome, of, this, engagement, japan, would, make, one, of, three, choices, if, the, combined, fleet, were, to, win, decisively, the, larger, part, of, the, japanese, army, would, undertake, immediate, landings, on, the, coast, between, shan, hai, kuan, and, tientsin, in, order, to, defeat, the, chinese, army, and, bring, the, war, to, a, swift, conclusion, if, the, engagement, were, to, be, a, draw, and, neither, side, gained, control, of, the, sea, the, army, would, concentrate, on, the, occupation, of, korea, lastly, if, the, combined, fleet, was, defeated, and, consequently, lost, command, of, the, sea, the, bulk, of, the, army, would, remain, in, japan, and, prepare, to, repel, a, chinese, invasion, while, the, fifth, division, in, korea, would, be, ordered, to, hang, on, and, fight, a, rearguard, action, on, 25, july, 1894, the, cruisers, yoshino, naniwa, and,

4, 000, on, a, rapid, forced, march, from, seoul, south, toward, asan, bay, to, face, chinese, troops, garrisoned, at, seonghwan, station, east, of, asan, and, kongju, the, chinese, forces, stationed, near, seonghwan, under, the, command, of, general, ye, zhichao, numbered, about, 3, 880, men, they, had, anticipated, the, impending, arrival, of, the, japanese, by, fortifying, their, position, with, trenches, earthworks, including, six, redoubts, protected, by, abatis, and, by, the, flooding, of, surrounding, rice, fields, but, expected, chinese, reinforcements, had, been, lost, on, board, the, british, chartered, transport, kowshing, units, of, the, chinese, main, force, were, deployed, east, and, northeast, of, asan, near, the, main, road, leading, to, seoul, the, key, positions, held, by, the, chinese, were, the, towns, of, seonghwan, and, cheonan, approximately, 3, 000, troops, were, stationed, at, seonghwan, while, 1, 000, men, along, with, general, ye, zhichao, were, at, headquarters, at, cheonan, the, remaining, chinese, troops, were, stationed, in, asan, itself, the, chinese, had, been, preparing, for, a, pincer, movement, against, the, korean, capital, by, massing, troops, at, pyongyang, in, the, north, and, asan, in, the, south, on, the, morning, of, 27, 28, july, 1894, the, two, forces, met, just, outside, asan, in, an, engagement, that, lasted, till, 07, 30, the, next, morning, the, battle, began, with, a, diversionary, attack, by, japanese, troops, followed, by, the, main, attack, which, quickly, outflanked, the, chinese, defences, the, chinese, troops, witnessing, that, they, were, being, outflanked, left, their, defensive, positions, and, fled, towards, the, direction, of, asan, the, chinese, gradually, lost, ground, to, the, superior, japanese, numbers, and, finally, broke, and, fled, towards, pyongyang, abandoning, arms, ammunition, and, all, their, artillery, the, japanese, took, the, city, of, asan, on, july, 29, breaking, the, chinese, encirclement, of, seoul, the, chinese, suffered, 500, killed, and, wounded, while, the, japanese, suffered, 88, casualties, general, ye, zhichao, reported, to, the, emperor, that, he, had, in, fact, won, the, battle, and, caused, over, 2, 000, casualties, to, the, japanese, forces, for, which, his, army, was, rewarded, with, 20, 000, taels, he, then, reported, later, that, 20, 000, japanese, attacked, him, and, he, inflicted, a, further, 1, 500, casualties, to, his, 300, losses, and, the, strategic, situation, compelled, him, to, withdraw, to, pyongyang, where, en, route, he, inflicted, a, further, 1, 500, casualties, ye, s, reports, of, the, battle, of, seonghwan, were, received, in, beijing, in, august, over, a, month, after, the, battle, occurred, an, indication, of, the, lack, of, proper, systems, of, communication, within, the, qing, army, on, 1, august, 1894, war, was, officially, declared, between, china, and, japan, the, rationale, language, and, tone, given, by, the, rulers, of, both, nations, in, their, respective, declarations, of, war, were, being, markedly, different, the, tenor, of, the, japanese, declaration, of, war, issued, in, the, name, of, the, meiji, emperor, appears, to, have, had, at, least, one, eye, fixed, on, the, wider, international, community, using, phrases, such, as, family, of, nations, the, law, of, nations, and, making, additional, references, to, international, treaties, this, was, in, sharp, contrast, to, the, chinese, approach, to, foreign, relations, which, historically, was, noted, for, refusing, to, treat, with, other, nations, on, an, equal, diplomatic, footing, and, instead, insistent, on, such, foreign, powers, paying, tribute, to, the, chinese, emperor, as, vassals, in, keeping, with, the, traditional, chinese, approach, to, its, neighbours, the, chinese, declaration, of, war, stated, the, palpable, disdain, for, the, japanese, can, be, surmised, from, the, repeated, use, of, the, term, wojen, which, translates, to, dwarf, an, ancient, intentionally, offensive, and, highly, derogative, term, for, the, japanese, this, use, of, the, pejorative, to, describe, a, foreign, nation, was, not, unusual, for, chinese, official, documents, of, the, time, so, much, so, that, a, major, bone, of, contention, between, imperial, china, and, the, treaty, powers, of, the, day, had, previously, been, the, habitual, use, of, the, chinese, character, yi, which, literally, meant, barbarian, to, refer, to, those, termed, otherwise, as, foreign, devils, or, y, nggu, zi, lit, overseas, devil, typically, describing, those, powers, occupying, the, treaty, ports, the, use, of, the, term, yi, by, chinese, imperial, officials, had, in, fact, been, considered, so, provocative, by, the, treaty, powers, that, the, collective, bundle, of, accords, known, as, the, treaty, of, tientsin, negotiated, in, 1858, to, end, the, second, opium, war, explicitly, proscribed, the, chinese, imperial, court, from, using, the, term, yi, to, refer, to, officials, subjects, or, citizens, of, the, belligerent, powers, the, signatories, seemingly, feeling, it, necessary, to, extract, this, specific, demand, from, the, xianfeng, emperor, s, representatives, in, the, thirty, five, years, elapsing, since, the, treaty, of, tientsin, however, the, language, of, the, chinese, emperors, would, appear, to, change, little, with, regards, to, its, neighbor, japan, after, the, initial, fighting, further, to, the, south, in, july, 1894, the, chinese, ground, forces, focused, on, holding, pyongyang, beyond, which, there, were, no, other, defensible, positions, until, the, yalu, river, the, border, between, korea, and, china, the, city, was, near, a, river, to, the, south, and, east, mountains, to, the, north, and, was, surrounded, by, walls, the, qing, deployed, 13, 000, troops, there, from, china, and, the, defenders, spent, almost, two, months, preparing, fortifications, after, they, arrived, in, the, city, on, august, 4, including, 27, forts, the, chinese, were, planning, to, use, pyongyang, as, their, headquarters, from, where, they, would, retake, the, rest, of, the, korean, peninsula, the, qing, forces, in, the, city, had, a, large, quantity, of, modern, equipment, and, some, of, their, best, troops, at, 04, 30, on, 15, september, the, imperial, japanese, army, converged, on, the, city, of, pyongyang, from, four, directions, with, a, total, of, 23, 800, troops, they, launched, an, artillery, barrage, from, the, east, and, a, feint, from, the, south, as, a, diversion, from, the, main, attack, coming, from, the, north, which, was, the, easiest, direction, to, approach, from, the, chinese, put, up, a, strong, resistance, and, it, was, some, of, the, fiercest, fighting, of, the, war, but, they, did, not, fire, on, japanese, troops, crossing, the, river, and, were, not, expecting, another, attack, from, the, north, once, the, japanese, entered, the, city, the, defenders, were, defeated, and, the, survivors, fled, being, attacked, by, a, separate, japanese, force, as, they, retreated, the, japanese, captured, 35, artillery, pieces, hundreds, of, rifles, and, ammunition, the, troops, led, by, the, chinese, hui, muslim, general, zuo, baogui, notably, fought, well, until, he, was, killed, in, action, by, japanese, artillery, taking, advantage, of, heavy, rainfall, overnight, the, remaining, chinese, troops, escaped, pyongyang, and, headed, northeast, toward, the, coastal, city, of, uiju, in, the, early, morning, of, 16, september, the, entire, japanese, army, entered, pyongyang, in, early, september, li, hongzhang, decided, to, reinforce, the, chinese, forces, at, pyongyang, by, employing, the, beiyang, fleet, to, escort, transports, to, the, mouth, of, the, taedong, river, about, 4, 500, additional, troops, stationed, in, the, zhili, were, to, be, redeployed, on, september, 12, half, of, the, troops, embarked, at, dagu, on, five, specially, chartered, transports, and, headed, to, dalian, where, two, days, later, on, september, 14, they, were, joined, by, another, 2, 000, soldiers, initially, admiral, ding, wanted, to, send, the, transports, under, a, light, escort, with, only, a, few, ships, while, the, main, force, of, the, beiyang, fleet, would, locate, and, operate, directly, against, the, combined, fleet, in, order, to, prevent, the, japanese, from, intercepting, the, convoy, but, the, appearance, of, the, japanese, cruisers, yoshino, and, naniwa, on, a, reconnaissance, sortie, near, weihaiwei, thwarted, these, plans, the, chinese, had, mistaken, them, for, the, main, japanese, fleet, consequently, on, september, 12, the, entire, beiyang, fleet, departed, dalian, heading, for, weihaiwei, arriving, near, the, shandong, peninsula, the, next, day, the, chinese, warships, spent, the, entire, day, cruising, the, area, waiting, for, the, japanese, however, since, there, was, no, sighting, of, the, japanese, fleet, admiral, ding, decided, to, return, to, dalian, reaching, the, port, in, the, morning, of, september, 15, as, japanese, troops, moved, north, to, attack, pyongyang, admiral, ito, correctly, guessed,

of, the, yalu, river, was, the, largest, naval, engagement, of, the, war, and, was, a, major, propaganda, victory, for, japan, after, taking, pyongyang, and, defeating, the, chinese, fleet, near, the, yalu, river, the, japanese, focused, on, capturing, china, s, two, naval, bases, guarding, the, approaches, to, the, qing, capital, port, arthur, on, the, liaodong, peninsula, in, northeast, china,

proceeded, with, the, unrestrained, killing, of, civilians, during, the, port, arthur, massacre, with, unconfirmed, estimates, in, the, thousands, this, event, was, at, the, time, widely, viewed, with, skepticism, as, the, world, at, large, was, still, in, disbelief, that, the, japanese, were, capable, of, such, deeds, it, seemed, more, likely, to, have, been, exaggerated, propagandist, fabrications, of, a, chinese, government, to, discredit, japanese, hegemony, in, reality, the, chinese, government, itself, was, unsure, how, to, react, and, initially, denied, the, occurrence, of, the, loss, of, port, arthur, to, the, japanese, altogether, as, we, entered, the, town, of, port, arthur, we, saw, the, head, of, a, japanese, soldier, displayed, on, a, wooden, stake, this, filled, us, with, rage, and, a, desire, to, crush, any, chinese, soldier, anyone, we, saw, in, the, town, we, killed, the, streets, were, filled, with, corpses, so, many, they, blocked, our, way, we, killed, people, in, their, homes, by, and, large, there, wasn, t, a, single, house, without, from, three, to, six, dead, blood, was, flowing, and, the, smell, was, awful, we, sent, out, search, parties, we, shot, some, hacked, at, others, the, chinese, troops, just, dropped, their, arms, and, fled, firing, and, slashing, it, was, unbounded, joy, at, this, time, our, artillery, troops, were, at, the,

shandong, peninsula, and, reached, the, landward, side, of, weihaiwei, where, the, siege, was, eventually, successful, for, the, japanese, after, weihaiwei, s, fall, on, 12, february, 1895, and, an, easing, of, harsh, winter, conditions, japanese, troops, pressed, further, into, southern, manchuria, and, northern, china, by, march, 1895, the, japanese, had, fortified, posts, that, commanded, the, sea, approaches, to, beijing, although, this, would, be, the, last, major, battle, fought, numerous, skirmishes, would, follow, the, battle, of, yingkou, was, fought, outside, the, port, town, of, yingkou, manchuria, on, 5, march, 1895, even, before, the, peace, negotiations, were, set, to, begin, at, shimonoseki, the, japanese, had, begun, preparations, for, the, capture, of, taiwan, however, the, first, operation, would, be, directed, not, against, the, island, itself, but, against, the, pescadores, islands, which, due, to, their, strategic, position, off, the, west, coast, would, become, a, stepping, stone, for, further, operations, against, the, island, on, march, 6, a, japanese, expeditionary, force, consisting, of, a, reinforced, infantry, regiment, with, 2, 800, troops, and, an, artillery, battery, were, embarked, on, five, transports, and, sailed, from, ujina, to, sasebo, arriving, there, three, days, later, on, march, 15, the, five, transports, escorted, by, seven,

unexpectedly, when, the, landing, operation, was, underway, the, guns, of, the, fort, once, again, opened, fire, which, caused, some, confusion, among, the, japanese, troops, but, they, were, soon, silenced, again, after, being, shelled, by, the, japanese, cruisers, by, 14, 00, lizhangjiao, was, under, japanese, control, after, reinforcing, the, captured, positions, the, following, morning, japanese, troops, marched, on, the, main, town, of, magong, the, chinese, offered, token, resistance, and, after, a, short, skirmish, they, abandoned, their, positions, retreating, to, nearby, xiyu, island, at, 11, 30, the, japanese, entered, magong, but, as, soon, as, they, had, taken, the, coastal, forts, in, the, town, they, were, fired, upon, by, the, chinese, coastal, battery, on, xiyu, island, the, barrage, went, unanswered, until, nightfall, as, the, chinese, had, destroyed, all, the, guns, at, magong, before, they, retreated, and, japanese, warships, feared, entering, the, strait, between, the, penghu, and, xiyu, islands, due, to, the, potential, threat, posed, by, mines, however, it, caused, no, serious, casualties, among, the, japanese, forces, during, the, night, a, small, naval, gunnery, crew, of, 30, managed, to, make, one, of, the, guns, of, the, magong, coastal, battery, operational, at, dawn, the, gun, began, shelling, the, chinese, positions, on, xiyu, but, the, chinese, guns, did, not, respond, subsequently, the, japanese, crossed, the, narrow, strait, reaching, xiyu, discovering, that, the, chinese, troops, had, abandoned, their, positions, during, the, night, and, escaped, on, board, local, vessels, the, japanese, warships, entered, the, strait, the, next, day, and, upon, discovering, that, there, were, no, mine, fields, they, entered, magong,

lost, 28, killed, and, wounded, while, the, chinese, losses, were, almost, 350, killed, or, wounded, and, nearly, 1, 000, taken, prisoner, this, operation, effectively, prevented, chinese, forces, in, taiwan, from, being, reinforced, and, allowed, the, japanese, to, press, their, demand, for, the, cession, of, taiwan, in, the, peace, negotiations, the, treaty, of, shimonoseki, was, signed, on, 17, april, 1895, china, recognized, the, total, independence, of, korea, and, ceded, the, liaodong, peninsula, taiwan, and, the, penghu, islands, to, japan, in, perpetuity, the, disputed, islands, known, as, senkaku, diaoyu, islands, were, not, named, by, this, treaty, but, japan, annexed, these, uninhabited, islands, to, okinawa, prefecture, in, 1895, japan, asserts, this, move, was, taken, independently, of, the, treaty, ending, the, war, and, china, asserts, that, they, were, implied, as, part, of, the, cession, of, taiwan, additionally, china, was, to, pay, japan, 200, million, taels, 8, 000, 000, kg, 17, 600, 000, lb, of, silver, as, war, reparations, the, qing, government, also, signed, a, commercial, treaty, permitting, japanese, ships, to, operate, on, the, yangtze, river, to, operate, manufacturing, factories, in, treaty, ports, and, to, open, four, more, ports, to, foreign, trade, russia, germany, and, france, in, a, few, days, made, the, triple, intervention, however, and, forced, japan, to, give, up, the, liaodong, peninsula, in, exchange, for, another, 30, million, taels, of, silver, equivalent, to, about, 450, million, yen, after, the, war, the, qing, government, paid, 200, million, kuping, taels, or, 311, 072, 865, yen, making, the, war, a, net, profit, for, japan, as, their, war, fund, was, only, 250, 000, 000, yen, the, cession, of, the, island, to, japan, was, received, with, such, disfavour, by, the, chinese, inhabitants, that, a, large, military, force, was, required, to, effect, its, occupation, for, nearly, two, years, afterwards, a, bitter, guerrilla, resistance, was, offered, to, the, japanese, troops, and, large, forces, over, 100, 000, men, it, was, stated, at, the, time, were, required, for, its, suppression, this, was, not, accomplished, without, much, cruelty, on, the, part, of, the, conquerors, who, in, their, march, through, the, island, perpetrated, all, the, worst, excesses, of, war, they, had, undoubtedly, considerable, provocation, they, were, constantly, ambushed, by, enemies, and, their, losses, from, battle, and, disease, far, exceeded, the, entire, loss, of, the, whole, japanese, army, throughout, the, manchurian, campaign, but, their, revenge, was, often, taken, on, innocent, villagers, men, women, and, children, were, ruthlessly, slaughtered, or, became, the, victims, of, unrestrained, lust, and, rapine, the, result, was, to, drive, from, their, homes, thousands, of, industrious, and, peaceful, peasants, who, long, after, the, main, resistance, had, been, completely, crushed, continued, to, wage, a, vendetta, war, and, to, generate, feelings, of, hatred, which, the, succeeding, years, of, conciliation, and, good, government, have, not, wholly, eradicated, the, cambridge, modern, history, volume, 12, several, qing, officials, in, taiwan, resolved, to, resist, the, cession, of, taiwan, to, japan, under, the, treaty, of, shimonoseki, and, on, 23, may, declared, the, island, to, be, an, independent, republic, of, formosa, on, 29, may, japanese, forces, under, admiral, kabayama, sukenori, landed, in, northern, taiwan, and, in, a, five, month, campaign, defeated, the, republican, forces, and, occupied, the, island, s, main, towns, the, campaign, effectively, ended, on, 21, october, 1895, with, the, flight, of, liu, yongfu, the, second, republican, president, and,

peninsula, in, china, its, decisions, of, abandoning, the, policy, of, isolation, and, learning, advanced, policy, from, western, countries, also, became, a, good, example, for, other, asian, countries, to, follow, as, a, result, of, the, war, japan, started, to, have, equal, status, with, the, western, powers, and, its, victory, established, japan, as, the, dominant, power, in, asia, with, them, gaining, several, much, needed, resources, such, as, iron, for, their, continued, modernization, and, expansion, it, also, heightened, japanese, ambitions, of, aggression, and, military, expansion, in, asia, because, japan, had, benefited, a, lot, from, the, treaty, it, stimulated, japanese, ambition, to, continue, to, invade, china, and, made, the, chinese, national, crisis, unprecedentedly, serious, the, degree, of, semi, colonisation, was, greatly, deepened, after, japan, s, victory, the, other, imperialist, powers, thought, that, they, could, also, get, benefits, from,

qing, administration, although, the, qing, court, had, invested, heavily, in, modern, ships, for, the, beiyang, fleet, the, institutional, weakness, of, the, qing, did, not, allow, the, development, of, effective, naval, power, traditionally, china, viewed, japan, as, a, subordinate, part, of, the, chinese, cultural, sphere, china, had, been, defeated, by, european, powers, in, the, 19th, century, but, defeat, at, the, hands, of, an, asian, power, was, a, bitter, psychological, blow, xenophobic, sentiment, and, agitation, grew, which, would, culminate, in, the, boxer, rebellion, five, years, later, the, manchu, people, were, devastated, by, the, fighting, during, the, first, sino, japanese, war, and, the, boxer, rebellion, with, massive, casualties, sustained, during, the, wars, it, was, then, driven, into, extreme, suffering, and, hardship, in, beijing, and, northeastern, china, japan, had, achieved, what, it, had, set, out, to, accomplish, and, ended, chinese, influence, over, korea, but, it, had, been, forced, to, relinquish, the, liaodong, peninsula, port, arthur, in, exchange, for, an, increased, financial, indemnity, the, european, powers, especially, russia, had, no, objection, to, the, other, clauses, of, the, treaty, but, felt, that, japan, should, not, gain, port, arthur, since, they, had, their, own, ambitions, in, that, part, of, the, world, russia, persuaded, germany, and, france, to, join, in, applying, diplomatic, pressure, on, japan, which, resulted, in, the, triple, intervention, of, 23, april, 1895, korea, proclaimed, itself, the, korean,

1895, a, pro, russian, official, attempted, to, remove, the, king, of, korea, to, the, russian, legation, and, a, second, attempt, later, succeeded, thus, for, a, year, the, king, reigned, from, the, russian, legation, in, seoul, the, concession, to, build, a, seoul, inchon, railway, that, had, been, granted, to, japan, in, 1894, was, revoked, and, granted, to, russia, russian, guards, guarded, the, king, in, his, palace, even, after, he, had, left, the, russian, legation, china, s, defeat, precipitated, an, increase, in, railway, construction, in, the, country, as, foreign, powers,

that, infuriated, the, japanese, they, were, more, concerned, with, the, russian, encroachment, in, korea, than, in, manchuria, other, powers, such, as, france, germany, and, britain, took, advantage, of, the, situation, in, china, and, gained, land, port, and, trade, concessions, at, the, expense, of, the, decaying, qing, dynasty, qingdao, was, acquired, by, germany, guangzhouwan, by, france, and, weihaiwei, and, the, new, territories, by, britain, tensions, between, russia, and, japan, would, increase, in, the, years, after, the, first, sino, japanese, war, during, the, boxer, rebellion, an, eight, member, international, force, was, sent, to, suppress, and, quell, the, uprising, russia, sent, troops, into, manchuria, as, part, of, that, force, after, the, suppression, of, the, boxers, the, russian, government, agreed, to, vacate, the, area, however, by, 1903, it, had, actually, increased, the, size, of, its, forces, in, manchuria, negotiations, between, the, two, nations, 1901, 1904, to, establish, mutual, recognition, of, respective, spheres, of, influence, russia, over, manchuria, and, japan, over, korea, were, repeatedly, and, intentionally, stalled, by, the, russians, they, felt, that, they, were, strong, and, confident, enough, not, to, accept, any, compromise, and, believed, that, japan, would, not, go, to, war, against, a, european, power, russia, also, had, intentions, to, use, manchuria, as, a, springboard, for, further, expansion, of, its, interests, in, the, far, east, in, 1903, russian, soldiers, began, construction, of, a, fort, at, yongnampo, but, stopped, after, japanese, protests, in, 1902, japan, formed, an, alliance, with, britain, the, terms, of, which, stated, that, if, japan, went, to, war, in, the, far, east, and, a, third, power, entered, the, fight, against, japan, britain, would, come, to, the, aid, of, the, japanese, that, was, a, check, to, prevent, germany, or, france, from, intervening, militarily, in, any, future, war, against, russia, japan, sought, to, prevent, a, repetition, of, the, triple, intervention, which, deprived, it, of, port, arthur, the, british, reasons, for, joining, the, alliance, were, to, check, the, spread, of, russian, expansion, into, the, pacific, area, to, strengthen, britain, s, focus, on, other, areas, and, to, gain, a, powerful, naval, ally, in, the, pacific, increasing, tensions, between, japan, and, russia, were, results, of, russia, s, unwillingness, to, compromise, and, the, prospect, of, korea, falling, under, russia, s, domination, and, thus, coming, into, conflict, with, and, undermining, japan, s, interests, eventually, japan, was, forced, to, take, action, that, would, be, the, deciding, factor, and, catalyst, leading, to, the, russo, japanese, war, of, 1904, 05
