the, chav, n, culture, was, a, pre, columbian, civilization, developed, in, the, northern, andean, highlands, of, peru, around, 900, bce, ending, around, 250, bce, it, extended, its, influence, to, other, civilizations, along, the, peruvian, coast, the, chav, n, people, whose, name, for, themselves, is, unknown, were, located, in, the, mosna, valley, where, the, mosna, and, huachecsa, rivers, merge, this, area, is, 3, 150, metres, 10, 330, ft, above, sea, level, and, encompasses, the, quechua, suni, and, puna, life, zones, in, the, periodization, of, pre, columbian, peru, the, chav, n, is, the, main, culture, of, the, early, horizon, period, in, highland, peru, characterized, by, the, intensification, of, the, religious, cult, the, appearance, of, ceramics, closely, related, to, the, ceremonial, centers, the, improvement, of, agricultural, techniques, and, the, development, of, metallurgy, and, textiles, the, best, known, archaeological, site, for, the, chav, n, culture, is, chav, n, de, hu, ntar, located, in, the, andean, highlands, of, the, present, day, ancash, region, although, chav, n, de, hu, ntar, may, or, may, not, have, been, the, center, or, birthplace, of, the, chav, n, culture, it, was, of, great, importance, and, has, been, designated, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, the, chief, example, of, architecture, is, the, chav, n, de, hu, ntar, temple, the, temple, s, design, shows, complex, innovation, to, adapt, to, the, highland, environments, of, peru, to, avoid, the, temple, s, being, flooded, and, destroyed, during, the, rainy, season, the, chav, n, people, created, a, successful, drainage, system, several, canals, built, under, the, temple, acted, as, drainage, the, chav, n, people, also, showed, advanced, acoustic, understanding, during, the, rainy, season, water, rushes, through, the, canals, and, creates, a, roaring, sound, that, emulates, a, jaguar, a, sacred, animal, the, temple, was, built, of, white, granite, and, black, limestone, neither, of, which, is, found, near, the, chav, n, site, this, meant, that, leaders, organized, many, workers, to, bring, the, special, materials, from, far, away, rather, than, use, local, rock, deposits, they, also, may, have, been, traded, from, different, civilizations, in, the, area, the, chav, n, culture, also, demonstrated, advanced, skills, and, knowledge, in, metallurgy, soldering, and, temperature, control, they, used, early, techniques, to, develop, refined, gold, work, the, melting, of, metal, had, been, discovered, at, this, point, and, was, used, as, a, solder, furthermore, the, people, domesticated, camelids, such, as, llamas, camelids, were, used, for, pack, animals, for, fiber, and, for, meat, they, produced, ch, arki, or, llama, jerky, this, product, was, commonly, traded, by, camelid, herders, and, was, the, main, economic, resource, for, the, chav, n, people, the, chav, n, people, also, successfully, cultivated, several, crops, including, potatoes, quinoa, and, maize, they, developed, an, irrigation, system, to, assist, the, growth, of, these, crops, there, is, an, absence, of, written, language, so, the, language, spoken, by, the, chav, n, people, is, not, known, but, it, is, likely, now, extinct, some, anthropologists, have, proposed, that, it, was, a, form, of, proto, quechuan, reasoning, that, the, quechuan, languages, highly, regular, morphology, and, syntax, compared, to, surrounding, languages, would, have, been, useful, for, allowing, intelligible, communication, between, communities, separated, by, mountain, ranges, as, some, chav, n, groups, were, on, the, other, hand, alfredo, torero, dates, the, proto, quechuan, languages, to, around, the, beginning, of, the, first, millennium, ce, when, the, first, chav, n, people, had, a, religion, chav, n, de, hu, ntar, was, the, place, of, origin, of, the, second, large, scale, political, entity, in, the, central, andes, and, this, is, mainly, due, to, the, extensive, architecture, at, the, site, as, well, as, the, architecture, is, considered, an, engineering, accomplishment, the, site, uses, both, internal, and, external, architecture, internal, architecture, refers, to, galleries, passageways, rooms, staircases, ventilation, shafts, and, drainage, canals, external, architecture, refers, to, plazas, platform, mounds, and, terraces, construction, of, the, old, temple, took, place, from, around, 900, to, 500, bce, and, construction, of, the, new, temple, the, structure, that, was, constructed, and, added, on, to, the, old, temple, took, place, from, around, 500, to, 200, bce, the, lack, of, residential, structures, occupational, deposits, generalized, weaponry, and, evidence, of, storage, further, make, the, site, s, architecture, more, interesting, as, it, focuses, mainly, on, the, temples, and, what, lies, inside, of, them, the, monumental, center, at, chav, n, de, hu, ntar, was, built, in, at, least, 15, known, phases, all, of, which, incorporate, the, 39, known, episodes, of, gallery, construction, the, earliest, known, construction, stage, the, separate, mound, stage, consisted, of, separate, buildings, and, do, not, conform, necessarily, to, the, u, shaped, pattern, seen, in, the, initial, horizon, period, and, the, early, horizon, period, during, the, expansion, stage, construction, integrated, stepped, platforms, and, created, contiguous, u, shaped, form, by, connecting, the, buildings, which, now, surround, open, spaces, at, this, stage, galleries, are, elaborate, in, form, and, features, during, the, black, and, white, stage, all, known, plazas, the, plaza, mayor, plaza, menor, and, the, circular, plaza, were, constructed, as, construction, came, to, an, end, galleries, took, on, a, more, standardized, look, by, the, end, of, the, growth, process, buildings, become, plazas, with, a, u, shaped, arrangement, and, an, east, west, axis, bisecting, the, enclosed, space, the, axis, also, intersects, the, lanz, n, modifications, were, done, during, all, stages, of, construction, to, maintain, access, to, the, internal, architecture, of, the, site, there, was, a, high, level, of, interest, in, maintaining, access, to, internal, architecture, and, sacred, elements, of, the, site, the, internal, architecture, was, constructed, as, part, of, a, single, design, and, was, intricately, incorporated, with, the, external, architecture, including, lateral, and, asymmetrical, growth, allowed, for, these, sacred, elements, to, remain, visible, including, the, lanz, n, the, lanz, n, gallery, was, created, from, an, earlier, freestanding, structure, that, was, then, transformed, into, a, stone, roofed, internal, space, by, constructing, around, it, the, lanz, n, was, possibly, present, before, the, roofing, as, it, is, likely, that, the, lanz, n, predates, the, construction, of, mounds, and, plazas, in, general, galleries, follow, construction, patterns, which, indicates, a, massive, effort, in, design, and, planning, maintaining, these, galleries, over, time, was, important, to, architects, the, galleries, are, known, to, be, windowless, dead, ends, sharp, turns, and, changes, in, floor, height, all, of, which, were, designed, to, disorient, people, walking, in, them, a, combination, of, symmetry, and, asymmetry, was, used, in, the, design, and, planning, of, the, site, construction, and, in, fact, guided, the, design, there, were, centered, placements, of, staircases, entrances, and, patios, all, of, which, were, consistently, prominent, in, the, last, stages, of, construction, due, to, constraints, centeredness, was, no, longer, possible, so, architects, shifted, to, constructing, symmetrical, pairs, externally, buildings, were, asymmetrical, to, each, other, the, primary, construction, materials, used, were, quartzite, and, sandstone, white, granite, and, black, limestone, alternate, coursing, of, quartzite, was, used, in, the, major, platforms, while, white, sandstone, and, white, granite, were, used, interchangeably, in, the, architecture, and, were, almost, always, cut, and, polished, granite, and, black, veined, limestone, were, the, raw, materials, used, in, almost, all, of, the, engraved, lithic, art, at, the, site, granite, was, also, used, extensively, in, the, construction, of, the, circular, plaza, stone, faced, platform, mounds, at, the, site, were, made, using, an, orderly, fill, of, rectangular, quartzite, blocks, in, leveled, layers, platforms, were, built, directly, on, top, of, fallen, wall, stones, from, earlier, constructions, as, there, was, little, to, no, attempt, to, remove, debris, the, chav, n, culture, represents, the, first, widespread, recognizable, artistic, style, in, the, andes, chav, n, art, can, be, divided, into, two, phases, the, first, phase, corresponding, to, the, construction, of, the, old, temple, at, chav, n, de, hu, ntar, c, 900, 500, bce, and, the, second, phase, corresponding, to, the, construction, of, chav, n, de, hu, ntar, s, new, temple, c, 500, 200, bce, chav, n, art, is, known, for, its, complex, iconography, and, its, mythical, realism, there, is, constant, evidence, within, all, types, of, art, ceramics, pottery, sculptures, etc, of, human, animal, interactions, which, was, reflective, of, societal, interconnections, and, how, the, chav, n, people, viewed, themselves, connected, with, the, other, world, some, other, iconography, found, in, chav, n, art, continues, to, give, a, glimpse, as, to, what, the, culture, was, like, such, as, the, general, evidence, of, the, use, of, psycho, active, plants, in, ritual, the, san, pedro, cactus, is, often, seen, on, various, art, forms, sometimes, being, held, by, humans, which, is, used, as, evidence, to, support, the, use, of, the, plant, the, stone, sculpture, stela, of, the, cactus, bearer, shows, an, anthropomorphized, being, with, serpent, hair, a, mouth, with, fangs, a, belt, with, a, two, headed, serpent, and, claws, who, in, their, right, hand, holds, what, appears, to, be, a, san, pedro, cactus, a, general, study, of, the, coastal, chav, n, pottery, with, respect, to, shape, reveals, two, kinds, of, vessels, a, polyhedral, carved, type, and, a, globular, painted, type, stylistically, chav, n, art, forms, make, extensive, use, of, the, technique, of, contour, rivalry, the, art, is, intentionally, difficult, to, interpret, and, understand, since, it, was, intended, only, to, be, read, by, high, priests, of, the, chav, n, cult, who, could, understand, the, intricately, complex, and, sacred, designs, the, raimondi, stele, is, one, of, the, major, examples, of, this, technique, ceramics, however, do, not, appear, to, represent, the, same, stylistic, features, that, are, found, on, sculptures, chav, n, art, decorates, the, walls, of, the, temple, and, includes, carvings, sculptures, and, pottery, artists, depicted, exotic, creatures, found, in, other, regions, such, as, jaguars, and, eagles, rather, than, local, plants, and, animals, the, feline, figure, is, one, of, the, most, important, motifs, seen, in, chav, n, art, it, has, an, important, religious, meaning, and, is, repeated, on, many, carvings, and, sculptures, eagles, are, also, commonly, seen, throughout, chav, n, art, there, are, three, important, artifacts, which, are, the, major, examples, of, chav, n, art, these, artifacts, are, the, tello, obelisk, tenon, heads, and, the, lanz, n, tello, obelisk, is, a, vertical, rectangular, shaft, with, a, step, like, notch, at, the, top, the, obelisk, is, carved, in, relief, on, all, four, sides, and, consists, of, two, representations, of, a, single, type, creature, the, head, body, and, tail, occupy, one, or, the, other, broad, sides, while, the, legs, genitalia, and, other, subsidiary, elements, occupy, the, narrow, sides, these, creatures, have, been, interpreted, as, a, cat, dragon, type, of, creature, by, tello, and, as, a, cayman, by, rowe, and, lathrop, the, large, artifact, may, portray, a, creation, myth, tenon, heads, are, found, throughout, chav, n, de, hu, ntar, and, are, one, of, the, most, well, known, images, associated, with, the, chav, n, civilization, tenon, heads, are, massive, stone, carvings, of, fanged, jaguar, heads, which, project, from, the, tops, of, the, interior, walls, possibly, the, most, impressive, artifact, from, chav, n, de, hu, ntar, is, the, lanz, n, the, lanz, n, is, a, 4, 53, meter, long, carved, granite, shaft, displayed, in, the, temple, the, shaft, extends, through, an, entire, floor, of, the, structure, and, the, ceiling, it, is, carved, with, an, image, of, a, fanged, deity, a, recurring, image, throughout, the, chav, n, civilization, the, lanz, n, is, found, in, a, gallery, inside, of, the, old, temple, the, sculpture, is, enhanced, by, the, four, openings, of, the, chamber, it, lies, in, making, it, so, that, it, allows, only, partial, and, segmented, views, in, rollout, drawings, the, figures, depicted, are, coherent, to, interpreters, but, it, s, important, to, note, that, this, is, not, how, the, lanz, n, is, meant, to, be, seen, the, chav, n, culture, had, a, wide, sphere, of, influence, throughout, surrounding, civilizations, especially, because, of, their, location, at, a, trade, crossing, point, between, the, deserts, and, amazon, jungle, for, example, pacopampa, located, north, about, a, 3, week, trek, of, chav, n, de, hu, ntar, has, renovations, on, the, main, temple, that, are, characteristic, of, chav, n, culture, caballo, muerto, a, coastal, site, in, the, moche, valley, region, has, an, adobe, structure, created, during, renovation, of, the, main, temple, the, adobe, related, to, chav, n, influence, garagay, a, site, in, the, modern, day, lima, region, has, variations, of, the, characteristic, chav, n, iconography, including, a, head, with, mucus, coming, from, the, nostrils, at, the, site, of, cerro, blanco, in, the, nepena, valley, excavations, revealed, chav, n, ceramics, warfare, does, not, seem, to, have, been, a, significant, element, in, chav, n, culture, the, archaeological, evidence, shows, a, lack, of, basic, defensive, structures, in, chav, n, centres, and, warriors, are, not, depicted, in, art, in, notable, contrast, to, the, earlier, art, at, cerro, sech, n, effective, social, control, may, have, been, exercised, by, religious, pressure, and, the, ability, to, exclude, dissidents, from, managed, water, resources, the, climate, and, terrain, of, the, neighbouring, areas, outside, the, managed, land, were, a, daunting, option, for, farmers, wishing, to, flee, the, culture, evidence, of, warfare, has, been, found, only, in, contemporaneous, sites, that, were, not, influenced, by, chav, n, culture, almost, as, if, those, other, civilizations, were, defending, themselves, via, warfare, from, chav, n, cultural, influence, chav, n, culture, as, a, style, and, probably, as, a, period, was, widespread, stretching, from, piura, on, the, far, north, coast, to, paracas, on, the, south, coast, and, from, chav, n, in, the, north, highlands, to, pucar, in, the, south, highlands, some, scholars, argued, that, the, development, of, chav, n, social, complexities, coincided, with, the, cultivation, of, maize, and, development, of, agricultural, surpluses, through, an, analysis, of, carbon, isotope, in, the, human, bones, found, at, chav, n, sites, researchers, have, proved, that, the, diet, consisted, mainly, of, c, 3, foods, such, as, potatoes, and, quinoa, while, maize, a, c, 4, food, was, not, a, part, of, the, main, diet, potato, and, quinoa, were, crops, better, adapted, to, the, chav, n, environment, they, are, more, resistant, to, the, frost, and, irregular, rain, fall, associated, with, high, altitude, environments, maize, would, not, have, been, able, to, thrive, in, such, conditions, the, kotosh, religious, tradition, preceded, the, chav, n, culture, at, various, sites, some, kotosh, elements, show, links, with, the, chav, n, culture, such, as, for, example, the, ceramic, styles, prior, to, kotosh, was, the, wairajirca, period, this, is, when, the, first, pottery, appeared, the, mito, tradition, was, even, earlier, this, was, a, preceramic, tradition, nevertheless, public, buildings, were, constructed, the, chav, n, culture, archaeological, horizon, itself, has, three, ceramic, stages, they, were, originally, identified, through, stratified, ceramics, and, encompass, three, stages, of, development, for, the, chav, n, culture, at, chav, n, power, was, legitimized, through, the, belief, in, the, small, elite, having, a, divine, connection, shamans, derived, power, and, authority, from, their, claim, to, a, divine, connection, the, community, believed, in, and, had, a, desire, to, connect, with, the, divine, with, asymmetrical, power, there, is, often, evidence, of, the, manipulation, of, traditions, strategic, manipulation, is, a, vehicle, of, change, which, shamans, could, use, to, produce, authority, during, the, chav, n, horizon, large, changes, were, taking, place, the, greater, degree, of, elaboration, of, persuasion, evident, in, the, rites, materials, and, settings, of, the, belief, system, the, more, likely, that, not, only, were, the, leaders, aware, of, being, self, serving, in, their, actions, but, also, they, were, actually, conscious, of, the, trajectory, change, the, archeological, evidence, shows, several, examples, of, reinterpretation, use, of, psychotropic, drugs, and, landscape, altering, it, also, shows, the, complex, planning, and, construction, of, stone, walled, galleries, the, concept, of, invented, tradition, refers, to, a, situation, in, which, outside, elements, are, newly, brought, together, to, depict, a, seemingly, old, tradition, this, can, be, seen, generally, in, the, architecture, at, chav, n, de, hu, ntar, which, bring, together, many, aspects, of, outside, cultures, to, create, a, unique, new, yet, traditional, appearance, the, use, of, psychotropic, drugs, introduces, a, medium, for, manipulation, only, indirect, evidence, supports, the, use, of, psychotropic, drugs, as, noted, above, scholars, have, not, been, able, to, determine, if, the, san, pedro, cactus, was, ingested, who, consumed, the, cactus, only, the, shaman, elite, or, more, widespread, among, the, masses, if, the, masses, were, taking, the, cactus, they, would, be, more, susceptible, to, the, influences, of, the, shamans, if, the, shamans, were, the, only, ones, to, consume, it, the, practice, may, have, been, sacred, and, a, status, symbol, the, shamans, would, be, perceived, to, have, special, powers, to, connect, with, nature, and, the, divine, the, extensive, degree, of, landscape, altering, at, chav, n, de, hu, ntar, for, temple, reconstructions, shows, that, someone, or, a, group, of, people, had, the, power, to, plan, the, reconstructions, and, influence, others, to, carry, out, those, plans, the, large, constructions, that, occurred, at, this, site, support, the, hypothesis, of, asymmetrical, power, finally, the, planning, and, construction, of, the, stone, walled, galleries, in, particular, suggest, a, hierarchical, system, in, addition, to, the, requirement, to, command, and, direct, the, manpower, required, the, galleries, show, unique, planning, they, allowed, only, one, entrance, this, is, atypical, of, the, time, when, rooms, commonly, had, multiple, entrances, and, exits, the, iconography, on, the, walls, of, the, stone, galleries, is, highly, complex, the, complexity, suggests, that, only, a, select, few, people, were, able, to, understand, the, iconography, such, people, would, serve, as, translators, for, the, few, others, who, were, privileged, to, view, the, stone, galleries, the, limited, access, both, physically, and, symbolically, of, the, stone, walled, galleries, supports, the, existence, of, a, shaman, elite, at, chav, n, de, hu, ntar, the, evolution, of, authority, at, chav, n, appears, to, have, resulted, from, a, planned, strategy, by, the, shamans, and, those, who, planned, and, constructed, the, ceremonial, center, religion, and, the, practices, which, followed, had, a, deeper, connection, to, the, sociopolitical, and, economic, aspects, within, the, chav, n, society, ritual, activity, for, the, chav, n, is, not, fully, understood, but, a, great, understanding, of, the, overall, ritual, influence, and, impact, that, ritual, had, on, the, chav, n, is, more, evident, through, their, architectural, structures, offering, deposits, and, artistic, remains, mainly, through, pictographic, displays, over, time, the, effects, of, ritual, moved, to, be, more, intimate, and, exclusive, as, evident, with, the, use, and, development, of, ritual, space, and, architecture, religious, figures, played, a, large, role, in, how, the, site, was, designed, and, how, rituals, were, oriented, the, overall, architecture, at, chav, n, had, religious, influence, and, significance, the, sacred, spaces, and, structures, within, this, society, were, evident, to, have, ritualistic, and, potentially, religious, purposes, understanding, how, the, site, of, chavin, de, hu, ntar, is, designed, allows, modern, individuals, to, recognize, how, the, site, reflects, intentionality, of, the, builders, to, relay, a, specific, experience, the, site, was, considered, to, be, sensory, meaning, that, the, architectural, structure, and, design, elicited, a, certain, feeling, through, the, senses, through, sight, and, touch, it, is, perception, which, is, essentially, a, series, of, physiological, responses, sacred, spaces, such, as, plazas, were, designed, to, mainly, disrupt, visual, impact, meaning, that, the, sacred, architecture, was, designed, to, be, experienced, more, so, than, actually, viewed, people, who, designed, and, built, the, architecture, at, chav, n, are, understood, to, be, priests, or, religious, leaders, within, the, community, configuration, of, the, site, also, emphasizes, that, there, was, a, presence, of, high, ranked, officials, the, architecture, within, chav, n, was, dictated, by, these, individuals, to, keep, the, ritual, elements, of, their, culture, prominent, this, was, done, so, through, the, details, and, formatting, of, each, building, which, in, essence, created, the, effect, that, those, participating, in, the, ritual, were, experiencing, their, religious, phenomena, construction, of, the, sacred, ritual, spaces, was, done, with, a, diverse, labor, pattern, and, no, central, authority, was, controlling, the, area, during, its, actual, construction, the, ritual, architecture, of, the, chav, n, is, similar, to, other, andean, coastal, architecture, the, earliest, architectural, forms, on, the, site, were, plastered, rectangular, chambers, one, of, these, later, housed, the, lanzon, the, architecture, of, the, chav, n, site, allowed, for, a, rich, and, diverse, ritual, practice, within, the, ritualized, spaces, leading, scholars, to, speculate, whether, or, not, the, chav, n, served, as, a, multi, ethnic, ceremonial, center, the, architecture, materials, and, offerings, might, have, been, inspired, by, other, cultures, but, there, is, a, question, as, to, whether, or, not, it, was, symbolic, of, a, greater, diverse, ritual, practice, the, ritual, spaces, themselves, had, a, hierarchy, and, legitimized, and, reflected, cosmological, and, social, order, and, structure, the, chav, n, buildings, and, spaces, used, for, ritual, were, constructed, to, elicit, an, experience, and, encompassed, many, of, the, overall, architectural, facets, described, previously, two, of, the, most, well, noted, ritual, spaces, include, the, old, temple, and, new, temple, with, a, shift, to, the, new, temple, as, time, progressed, both, temples, featured, pathways, and, deity, worship, spaces, on, the, north, and, south, wings, in, addition, to, this, the, temples, most, notably, the, old, temple, had, deities, carved, into, stone, the, temples, were, conformed, into, a, u, shaped, area, encompassing, a, circular, plaza, the, temples, featured, ceremonial, chambers, and, sacred, hearths, another, important, structure, designed, and, utilized, for, ritual, included, plazas, of, which, there, were, many, the, circular, plaza, in, particular, and, the, square, plaza, were, two, of, the, sites, primarily, focused, around, ceremonial, activity, within, the, chav, n, site, was, a, structure, which, revealed, rooms, and, galleries, speculated, by, archaeologists, to, be, used, as, ritual, chambers, for, a, variety, of, ceremonies, including, what, could, have, been, a, ceremony, surrounding, fire, major, use, of, underground, space, in, the, form, of, stone, lined, galleries, that, are, often, like, labyrinths, and, run, through, the, monuments, major, platforms, and, mounds, has, been, speculated, to, be, a, center, for, religious, activity, where, ceremonies, occurred, in, several, different, contexts, involving, both, audiences, and, participants, the, open, spaces, of, plazas, versus, the, small, restricted, spaces, of, chav, n, galleries, in, the, temple, shows, that, there, is, a, progression, of, how, the, ritual, spaces, and, architecture, was, used, moving, more, from, public, to, private, practice, the, gallery, spaces, are, central, to, understanding, the, implications, of, the, chav, n, ritual, practices, in, fact, these, underground, galleries, were, more, than, just, a, place, of, ritual, as, was, recently, discovered, in, 2018, by, a, team, of, archaeologists, led, by, john, rick, through, the, use, of, all, terrain, robots, these, galleries, were, the, final, resting, place, for, presumably, the, temple, s, builders, the, men, s, bodies, weren, t, buried, in, a, very, honorable, way, they, were, face, down, covered, by, rocks, john, rick, raised, the, possibility, yet, to, be, confirmed, that, these, people, could, very, well, have, been, sacrificed, this, discovery, shed, some, light, as, to, where, the, people, of, chav, n, buried, their, dead, although, there, might, be, other, burial, sites, as, the, director, for, the, excavation, said, that, he, doesn, t, believe, it, was, customary, to, bury, them, in, those, galleries, just, that, it, sometimes, happened, if, it, becomes, known, through, the, study, of, the, remains, that, they, were, indeed, sacrificed, it, could, also, serve, to, prove, the, theory, that, the, galleries, were, a, place, of, ritual, but, for, now, we, can, only, know, for, sure, that, it, was, the, final, resting, place, for, the, men, who, built, the, temple, the, sizes, of, the, spaces, in, the, sacred, spaces, provided, different, amounts, of, room, for, people, to, congregate, external, spaces, such, as, the, plazas, had, the, ability, to, hold, more, individuals, for, ritual, practices, the, square, plaza, could, have, held, 5, 200, individuals, the, circular, plaza, could, have, held, around, 600, individuals, internal, spaces, within, the, temples, for,
