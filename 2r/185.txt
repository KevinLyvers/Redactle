timeline, the, roman, kingdom, also, referred, to, as, the, roman, monarchy, or, the, regal, period, of, ancient, rome, was, the, earliest, period, of, roman, history, when, the, city, and, its, territory, were, ruled, by, kings, according, to, tradition, the, roman, kingdom, began, with, the, city, s, founding, c, 753, bc, with, settlements, around, the, palatine, hill, along, the, river, tiber, in, central, italy, and, ended, with, the, overthrow, of, the, kings, and, the, establishment, of, the, republic, c, 509, bc, little, is, certain, about, the, kingdom, s, history, as, no, records, and, few, inscriptions, from, the, time, of, the, kings, survive, the, accounts, of, this, period, written, during, the, republic, and, the, empire, are, thought, largely, to, be, based, on, oral, tradition, the, site, of, the, founding, of, the, roman, kingdom, and, eventual, republic, and, empire, included, a, ford, where, one, could, cross, the, river, tiber, in, central, italy, the, palatine, hill, and, hills, surrounding, it, provided, easily, defensible, positions, in, the, wide, fertile, plain, surrounding, them, each, of, these, features, contributed, to, the, success, of, the, city, the, traditional, version, of, roman, history, which, has, come, down, principally, through, livy, 64, or, 59, bc, ad, 12, or, 17, plutarch, 46, 120, and, dionysius, of, halicarnassus, c, 60, bc, after, 7, bc, recounts, that, a, series, of, seven, kings, ruled, the, settlement, in, rome, s, first, centuries, the, traditional, chronology, as, codified, by, varro, 116, bc, 27, bc, and, fabius, pictor, c, 270, c, 200, bc, allows, 243, years, for, their, combined, reigns, an, average, of, almost, 35, years, since, the, work, of, barthold, georg, niebuhr, modern, scholarship, has, generally, discounted, this, schema, the, gauls, destroyed, many, of, rome, s, historical, records, when, they, sacked, the, city, after, the, battle, of, the, allia, in, 390, bc, according, to, varro, according, to, polybius, the, battle, occurred, in, 387, 6, and, what, remained, eventually, fell, prey, to, time, or, to, theft, with, no, contemporary, records, of, the, kingdom, surviving, all, accounts, of, the, roman, kings, must, be, carefully, questioned, the, kings, following, romulus, the, city, s, founder, were, elected, by, the, people, of, rome, to, serve, for, life, and, did, not, rely, upon, military, force, to, gain, or, keep, the, throne, the, only, king, to, break, fully, with, this, tradition, was, lucius, tarquinius, superbus, the, final, king, who, according, to, tradition, seized, power, from, his, predecessor, and, ruled, as, a, tyrant, the, insignia, of, the, kings, of, rome, were, twelve, lictors, attendants, or, servants, wielding, the, symbolic, fasces, bearing, axes, the, right, to, sit, upon, a, curule, seat, the, purple, toga, picta, red, shoes, and, a, white, diadem, around, the, head, of, all, these, insignia, the, most, important, was, the, purple, toga, picta, the, king, was, invested, with, supreme, military, executive, and, judicial, authority, through, the, use, of, imperium, formally, granted, to, the, king, by, the, curiate, assembly, with, the, passing, of, the, lex, curiata, de, imperio, at, the, beginning, of, each, king, s, reign, the, imperium, of, the, king, was, held, for, life, and, protected, him, from, ever, being, brought, to, trial, for, his, actions, as, the, king, was, the, sole, owner, of, imperium, in, rome, at, the, time, he, possessed, ultimate, executive, power, and, unchecked, military, authority, as, the, commander, in, chief, of, all, of, the, roman, legions, also, the, laws, that, kept, citizens, safe, from, magistrates, misuse, of, imperium, did, not, exist, during, the, monarchical, period, the, king, had, the, power, to, either, appoint, or, nominate, all, officials, to, offices, he, would, appoint, a, tribunus, celerum, to, serve, as, both, the, tribune, of, the, ramnes, tribe, in, rome, and, as, the, commander, of, the, king, s, personal, bodyguard, the, celeres, the, king, was, required, to, appoint, the, tribune, upon, entering, office, and, the, tribune, left, office, upon, the, king, s, death, the, tribune, was, second, in, rank, to, the, king, and, also, possessed, the, power, to, convene, the, curiate, assembly, and, lay, legislation, before, it, another, officer, appointed, by, the, king, was, the, praefectus, urbi, who, acted, as, the, warden, of, the, city, when, the, king, was, absent, from, the, city, the, prefect, held, all, of, the, king, s, powers, and, abilities, even, to, the, point, of, being, bestowed, with, imperium, while, inside, the, city, the, king, also, received, the, right, to, be, the, only, person, to, appoint, patricians, to, the, senate, what, is, known, for, certain, is, that, the, king, alone, possessed, the, right, to, the, augury, on, behalf, of, rome, as, its, chief, augur, and, no, public, business, could, be, performed, without, the, will, of, the, gods, made, known, through, auspices, the, people, knew, the, king, as, a, mediator, between, them, and, the, gods, cf, latin, pontifex, bridge, builder, in, this, sense, between, men, and, the, gods, and, thus, viewed, the, king, with, religious, awe, this, made, the, king, the, head, of, the, national, religion, and, its, chief, executive, having, the, power, to, control, the, roman, calendar, he, conducted, all, religious, ceremonies, and, appointed, lower, religious, offices, and, officers, it, is, said, that, romulus, himself, instituted, the, augurs, and, was, believed, to, have, been, the, best, augur, of, all, likewise, king, numa, pompilius, instituted, the, pontiffs, and, through, them, developed, the, foundations, of, the, religious, dogma, of, rome, under, the, kings, the, senate, and, curiate, assembly, had, very, little, power, and, authority, they, were, not, independent, since, they, lacked, the, right, to, meet, together, and, discuss, questions, of, state, at, their, own, will, they, could, be, called, together, only, by, the, king, and, could, discuss, only, the, matters, that, the, king, laid, before, them, while, the, curiate, assembly, had, the, power, to, pass, laws, that, had, been, submitted, by, the, king, the, senate, was, effectively, an, honorary, council, it, could, advise, the, king, on, his, action, but, by, no, means, could, prevent, him, from, acting, the, only, thing, that, the, king, could, not, do, without, the, approval, of, the, senate, and, the, curiate, assembly, was, to, declare, war, against, a, foreign, nation, the, king, s, imperium, both, granted, him, military, powers, and, qualified, him, to, pronounce, legal, judgement, in, all, cases, as, the, chief, justice, of, rome, though, he, could, assign, pontiffs, to, act, as, minor, judges, in, some, cases, he, had, supreme, authority, in, all, cases, brought, before, him, both, civil, and, criminal, this, made, the, king, supreme, in, times, of, both, war, and, peace, while, some, writers, believed, there, was, no, appeal, from, the, king, s, decisions, others, believed, that, a, proposal, for, appeal, could, be, brought, before, the, king, by, any, patrician, during, a, meeting, of, the, curiate, assembly, to, assist, the, king, a, council, advised, him, during, all, trials, but, this, council, had, no, power, to, control, his, decisions, also, two, criminal, detectives, quaestores, parricidi, were, appointed, by, him, as, well, as, a, two, man, criminal, court, duumviri, perduellionis, which, oversaw, cases, of, treason, according, to, livy, lucius, tarquinius, superbus, the, seventh, and, final, king, of, rome, judged, capital, criminal, cases, without, the, advice, of, counsellors, thereby, creating, fear, amongst, those, who, might, think, to, oppose, him, whenever, a, king, died, rome, entered, a, period, of, interregnum, supreme, power, of, the, state, would, devolve, to, the, senate, which, was, responsible, for, finding, a, new, king, the, senate, would, assemble, and, appoint, one, of, its, own, members, the, interrex, to, serve, for, a, period, of, five, days, with, the, sole, purpose, of, nominating, the, next, king, of, rome, if, no, king, were, nominated, at, the, end, of, five, days, with, the, senate, s, consent, the, interrex, would, appoint, another, senator, to, succeed, him, for, another, five, day, term, this, process, would, continue, until, a, new, king, was, elected, once, the, interrex, found, a, suitable, nominee, to, the, kingship, he, would, bring, the, nominee, before, the, senate, and, the, senate, would, review, him, if, the, senate, passed, the, nominee, the, interrex, would, convene, the, curiate, assembly, and, preside, over, it, during, the, election, of, the, king, once, the, nominee, was, proposed, to, the, curiate, assembly, the, citizens, of, rome, could, either, accept, or, reject, him, if, accepted, the, king, elect, did, not, immediately, enter, office, two, other, acts, still, had, to, take, place, before, he, was, invested, with, the, full, regal, authority, and, power, first, it, was, necessary, to, obtain, the, divine, will, of, the, gods, respecting, his, appointment, by, means, of, the, auspices, since, the, king, would, serve, as, high, priest, of, rome, this, ceremony, was, performed, by, an, augur, who, conducted, the, king, elect, to, the, citadel, where, he, was, placed, on, a, stone, seat, as, the, people, waited, below, if, found, worthy, of, the, kingship, the, augur, announced, that, the, gods, had, given, favourable, tokens, thus, confirming, the, king, s, priestly, character, the, second, act, which, had, to, be, performed, was, the, conferral, of, the, imperium, upon, the, king, the, curiate, assembly, s, previous, vote, only, determined, who, was, to, be, king, and, had, not, by, that, act, bestowed, the, necessary, power, of, the, king, upon, him, accordingly, the, king, himself, proposed, to, the, curiate, assembly, a, law, granting, him, imperium, and, the, curiate, assembly, by, voting, in, favor, of, the, law, would, grant, it, in, theory, the, people, of, rome, elected, their, leader, but, the, senate, had, most, of, the, control, over, the, process, according, to, legend, romulus, established, the, senate, after, he, founded, rome, by, personally, selecting, the, most, noble, men, wealthy, men, with, legitimate, wives, and, children, to, serve, as, a, council, for, the, city, as, such, the, senate, was, the, king, s, advisory, council, as, the, council, of, state, the, senate, was, composed, of, 300, senators, with, 100, senators, representing, each, of, the, three, ancient, tribes, of, rome, the, ramnes, latins, tities, sabines, and, luceres, etruscans, within, each, tribe, a, senator, was, selected, from, each, of, the, tribe, s, ten, curiae, the, king, had, the, sole, authority, to, appoint, the, senators, but, this, selection, was, done, in, accordance, with, ancient, custom, under, the, monarchy, the, senate, possessed, very, little, power, and, authority, as, the, king, held, most, of, the, political, power, of, the, state, and, could, exercise, those, powers, without, the, senate, s, consent, the, chief, function, of, the, senate, was, to, serve, as, the, king, s, council, and, be, his, legislative, coordinator, once, legislation, proposed, by, the, king, passed, the, curiate, assembly, the, senate, could, either, veto, it, or, accept, it, as, law, the, king, was, by, custom, to, seek, the, advice, of, the, senate, on, major, issues, however, it, was, left, to, him, to, decide, what, issues, if, any, were, brought, before, them, and, he, was, free, to, accept, or, reject, their, advice, as, he, saw, fit, only, the, king, possessed, the, power, to, convene, the, senate, except, during, the, interregnum, during, which, the, senate, possessed, the, authority, to, convene, itself, son, of, the, vestal, virgin, rhea, silvia, ostensibly, by, the, god, mars, the, legendary, romulus, was, rome, s, founder, and, first, king, after, he, and, his, twin, brother, remus, had, deposed, king, amulius, of, alba, and, reinstated, the, king, s, brother, and, their, grandfather, numitor, to, the, throne, they, decided, to, build, a, city, in, the, area, where, they, had, been, abandoned, as, infants, after, killing, remus, in, a, dispute, romulus, began, building, the, city, on, the, palatine, hill, his, work, began, with, fortifications, he, permitted, men, of, all, classes, to, come, to, rome, as, citizens, including, slaves, and, freemen, without, distinction, he, is, credited, with, establishing, the, city, s, religious, legal, and, political, institutions, the, kingdom, was, established, by, unanimous, acclaim, with, him, at, the, helm, when, romulus, called, the, citizenry, to, a, council, for, the, purposes, of, determining, their, government, romulus, established, the, senate, as, an, advisory, council, with, the, appointment, of, 100, of, the, most, noble, men, in, the, community, these, men, he, called, patres, from, pater, father, head, and, their, descendants, became, the, patricians, to, project, command, he, surrounded, himself, with, attendants, in, particular, the, twelve, lictors, he, created, three, divisions, of, horsemen, equites, called, centuries, ramnes, romans, tities, after, the, sabine, king, and, luceres, etruscans, he, also, divided, the, populace, into, 30, curiae, named, after, 30, of, the, sabine, women, who, had, intervened, to, end, the, war, between, romulus, and, tatius, the, curiae, formed, the, voting, units, in, the, popular, assemblies, comitia, curiata, romulus, was, behind, one, of, the, most, notorious, acts, in, roman, history, the, incident, commonly, known, as, the, rape, of, the, sabine, women, to, provide, his, citizens, with, wives, romulus, invited, the, neighbouring, tribes, to, a, festival, in, rome, where, the, romans, committed, a, mass, abduction, of, young, women, from, among, the, attendees, the, accounts, vary, from, 30, to, 683, women, taken, a, significant, number, for, a, population, of, 3, 000, latins, and, presumably, for, the, sabines, as, well, war, broke, out, when, romulus, refused, to, return, the, captives, after, the, sabines, made, three, unsuccessful, attempts, to, invade, the, hill, settlements, of, rome, the, women, themselves, intervened, during, the, battle, of, the, lacus, curtius, to, end, the, war, the, two, peoples, were, united, in, a, joint, kingdom, with, romulus, and, the, sabine, king, titus, tatius, sharing, the, throne, in, addition, to, the, war, with, the, sabines, romulus, waged, war, with, the, fidenates, and, veientes, and, others, he, reigned, for, thirty, seven, years, according, to, the, legend, romulus, vanished, at, age, fifty, four, while, reviewing, his, troops, on, the, campus, martius, he, was, reported, to, have, been, taken, up, to, mt, olympus, in, a, whirlwind, and, made, a, god, after, initial, acceptance, by, the, public, rumours, and, suspicions, of, foul, play, by, the, patricians, began, to, grow, in, particular, some, thought, that, members, of, the, nobility, had, murdered, him, dismembered, his, body, and, buried, the, pieces, on, their, land, these, were, set, aside, after, an, esteemed, nobleman, testified, that, romulus, had, come, to, him, in, a, vision, and, told, him, that, he, was, the, god, quirinus, he, became, not, only, one, of, the, three, major, gods, of, rome, but, the, very, likeness, of, the, city, itself, a, replica, of, romulus, s, hut, was, maintained, in, the, centre, of, rome, until, the, end, of, the, roman, empire, after, romulus, died, there, was, an, interregnum, for, one, year, during, which, ten, men, chosen, from, the, senate, governed, rome, as, successive, interreges, under, popular, pressure, the, senate, finally, chose, the, sabine, numa, pompilius, to, succeed, romulus, on, account, of, his, reputation, for, justice, and, piety, the, choice, was, accepted, by, the, curiate, assembly, numa, s, reign, was, marked, by, peace, and, religious, reform, he, constructed, a, new, temple, to, janus, and, after, establishing, peace, with, rome, s, neighbours, closed, the, doors, of, the, temple, to, indicate, a, state, of, peace, they, remained, closed, for, the, rest, of, his, reign, he, established, the, vestal, virgins, at, rome, as, well, as, the, salii, and, the, flamines, for, jupiter, mars, and, quirinus, he, also, established, the, office, and, duties, of, pontifex, maximus, numa, reigned, for, 43, years, he, reformed, the, roman, calendar, by, adjusting, it, for, the, solar, and, lunar, year, as, well, as, by, adding, the, months, of, january, and, february, to, bring, the, total, number, of, months, to, twelve, tullus, hostilius, was, as, warlike, as, romulus, had, been, completely, unlike, numa, as, he, lacked, any, respect, for, the, gods, tullus, waged, war, against, alba, longa, fidenae, and, veii, and, the, sabines, during, tullus, s, reign, the, city, of, alba, longa, was, completely, destroyed, and, tullus, integrated, its, population, into, rome, tullus, is, attributed, with, constructing, a, new, home, for, the, senate, the, curia, hostilia, which, survived, for, 562, years, after, his, death, according, to, livy, tullus, neglected, the, worship, of, the, gods, until, towards, the, end, of, his, reign, he, fell, ill, and, became, superstitious, however, when, tullus, called, upon, jupiter, and, begged, assistance, jupiter, responded, with, a, bolt, of, lightning, that, burned, the, king, and, his, house, to, ashes, his, reign, lasted, for, 32, years, following, the, mysterious, death, of, tullus, the, romans, elected, a, peaceful, and, religious, king, in, his, place, numa, s, grandson, ancus, marcius, much, like, his, grandfather, ancus, did, little, to, expand, the, borders, of, rome, and, only, fought, wars, to, defend, the, territory, he, also, built, rome, s, first, prison, on, the, capitoline, hill, ancus, further, fortified, the, janiculum, hill, on, the, western, bank, and, built, the, first, bridge, across, the, tiber, river, he, also, founded, the, port, of, ostia, antica, on, the, tyrrhenian, sea, and, established, rome, s, first, salt, works, as, well, as, the, city, s, first, aqueduct, rome, grew, as, ancus, used, diplomacy, to, peacefully, unite, smaller, surrounding, cities, into, alliance, with, rome, thus, he, completed, the, conquest, of, the, latins, and, relocated, them, to, the, aventine, hill, thus, forming, the, plebeian, class, of, romans, he, died, a, natural, death, like, his, grandfather, after, 25, years, as, king, marking, the, end, of, rome, s, latin, sabine, kings, lucius, tarquinius, priscus, was, the, fifth, king, of, rome, and, the, first, of, etruscan, birth, after, immigrating, to, rome, he, gained, favor, with, ancus, who, later, adopted, him, as, son, upon, ascending, the, throne, he, waged, wars, against, the, sabines, and, etruscans, doubling, the, size, of, rome, and, bringing, great, treasures, to, the, city, to, accommodate, the, influx, of, population, the, aventine, and, caelian, hills, were, populated, one, of, his, first, reforms, was, to, add, 100, new, members, to, the, senate, from, the, conquered, etruscan, tribes, bringing, the, total, number, of, senators, to, 200, he, used, the, treasures, rome, had, acquired, from, the, conquests, to, build, great, monuments, for, rome, among, these, were, rome, s, great, sewer, systems, the, cloaca, maxima, which, he, used, to, drain, the, swamp, like, area, between, the, seven, hills, of, rome, in, its, place, he, began, construction, on, the, roman, forum, he, also, founded, the, roman, games, priscus, initiated, great, building, projects, including, the, city, s, first, bridge, the, pons, sublicius, the, most, famous, is, the, circus, maximus, a, giant, stadium, for, chariot, races, after, that, he, started, the, building, of, the, temple, fortress, to, the, god, jupiter, on, the, capitoline, hill, however, before, it, was, completed, he, was, killed, by, a, son, of, ancus, marcius, after, 38, years, as, king, his, reign, is, best, remembered, for, introducing, the, roman, symbols, of, military, and, civil, offices, and, the, roman, triumph, being, the, first, roman, to, celebrate, one, priscus, was, succeeded, by, his, son, in, law, servius, tullius, rome, s, second, king, of, etruscan, birth, and, the, son, of, a, slave, like, his, father, in, law, servius, fought, successful, wars, against, the, etruscans, he, used, the, booty, to, build, the, first, wall, all,

tribes, based, on, location, thus, establishing, the, tribal, assembly, he, also, oversaw, the, construction, of, the, temple, of, diana, on, the, aventine, hill, servius, reforms, made, a, big, change, in, roman, life, voting, rights, based, on, socio, economic, status, favouring, elites, however, over, time, servius, increasingly, favoured, the, poor, in, order, to, gain, support, from, plebeians, often, at, the, expense, of, patricians, after, a, 44, year, reign, servius, was, killed, in, a, conspiracy, by, his, daughter, tullia, and, her, husband, lucius, tarquinius, superbus, the, seventh, and, final, king, of, rome, was, lucius, tarquinius, superbus, he, was, the, son, of, priscus, and, the, son, in, law, of, servius, whom, he, and, his, wife, had, killed, tarquinius, waged, a, number, of, wars, against, rome, s, neighbours, including, against, the, volsci, gabii, and, the, rutuli, he, also, secured, rome, s, position, as, head, of, the, latin, cities, he, also, engaged, in, a, series, of, public, works, notably, the, completion, of, the, temple, of, jupiter, optimus, maximus, and, works, on, the, cloaca, maxima, and, the, circus, maximus, however, tarquin, s, reign, is, remembered, for, his, use, of, violence, and, intimidation, to, control, rome, and, his, disrespect, for, roman, custom, and, the, roman, senate, tensions, came, to, a, head, when, the, king, s, son, sextus, tarquinius, raped, lucretia, wife, and, daughter, to, powerful, roman, nobles, lucretia, told, her, relatives, about, the, attack, and, committed, suicide, to, avoid, the, dishonour, of, the, episode, four, men, led, by, lucius, junius, brutus, and, including, lucius, tarquinius, collatinus, publius, valerius, poplicola, and, spurius, lucretius, tricipitinus, incited, a, revolution, that, deposed, and, expelled, tarquinius, and, his, family, from, rome, in, 509, bc, tarquin, was, viewed, so, negatively, that, the, word, for, king, rex, held, a, negative, connotation, in, the, latin, language, until, the, fall, of, the, roman, empire, lucius, junius, brutus, and, lucius, tarquinius, collatinus, became, rome, s, first, consuls, marking, the, beginning, of, the, roman, republic, this, new, government, would, survive, for, the, next, 500, years, until, the, rise, of, julius, caesar, and, augustus, and, would, cover, a, period, during, which, rome, s, authority, and, area, of, control, extended, to, cover, vast, areas, of, europe, north, africa, and, west, asia, he, ruled, 25, years, in, order, to, replace, the, leadership, of, the, kings, a, new, office, was, created, with, the, title, of, consul, initially, the, consuls, possessed, all, of, the, king, s, powers, in, the, form, of, two, men, elected, for, a, one, year, term, who, could, veto, each, other, s, actions, later, the, consuls, powers, were, broken, down, further, by, adding, other, magistrates, that, each, held, a, small, portion, of, the, king, s, original, powers, first, among, these, was, the, praetor, which, removed, the, consuls, judicial, authority, from, them, next, came, the, censor, which, stripped, from, the, consuls, the, power, to, conduct, the, census, the, romans, instituted, the, idea, of, a, dictatorship, a, dictator, would, have, complete, authority, over, civil, and, military, matters, within, the, roman, imperium, since, he, was, not, legally, responsible, for, his, actions, as, a, dictator, he, was, unquestionable, however, the, power, of, the, dictator, was, so, absolute, that, ancient, romans, were, hesitant, in, electing, one, reserving, this,
