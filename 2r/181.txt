peloponnesian, league, victory, the, peloponnesian, war, ancient, greek, romanized, p, lemos, t, n, peloponn, s, n, 431, 404, bc, was, an, ancient, greek, war, fought, between, athens, and, sparta, and, their, respective, allies, for, the, hegemony, of, the, greek, world, the, war, remained, undecided, until, the, later, intervention, of, the, persian, empire, in, support, of, sparta, led, by, lysander, the, spartan, fleet, built, with, persian, subsidies, finally, defeated, athens, which, began, a, period, of, spartan, hegemony, over, greece, historians, have, traditionally, divided, the, war, into, three, phases, the, first, phase, 431, 421, bc, was, named, the, ten, years, war, or, the, archidamian, war, after, the, spartan, king, archidamus, ii, who, invaded, attica, several, times, with, the, full, hoplite, army, of, the, peloponnesian, league, the, alliance, network, dominated, by, sparta, then, known, as, lacedaemon, the, long, walls, of, athens, rendered, this, strategy, ineffective, while, the, superior, navy, of, the, delian, league, athens, alliance, raided, the, peloponnesian, coast, to, trigger, rebellions, within, sparta, the, precarious, peace, of, nicias, was, signed, in, 421, bc, and, lasted, until, 413, bc, several, proxy, battles, took, place, during, this, period, notably, the, battle, of, mantinea, in, 418, bc, won, by, sparta, against, an, ad, hoc, alliance, of, elis, mantinea, both, former, spartan, allies, argos, and, athens, the, main, event, was, the, sicilian, expedition, between, 415, and, 413, bc, during, which, athens, lost, almost, all, its, navy, in, the, attempt, to, capture, syracuse, an, ally, of, sparta, the, sicilian, disaster, prompted, the, third, phase, of, the, war, 413, 404, bc, named, the, decelean, war, or, the, ionian, war, when, the, persian, empire, supported, sparta, to, recover, the, suzerainty, of, the, greek, cities, of, asia, minor, incorporated, into, the, delian, league, at, the, end, of, the, persian, wars, with, persian, money, sparta, built, a, massive, fleet, under, the, leadership, of, lysander, who, won, a, streak, of, decisive, victories, in, the, aegean, sea, notably, at, aegospotamos, in, 405, bc, athens, capitulated, the, following, year, and, lost, all, its, empire, lysander, imposed, puppet, oligarchies, on, the, former, members, of, the, delian, league, including, athens, where, the, regime, was, known, as, the, thirty, tyrants, the, peloponnesian, war, was, followed, ten, years, later, by, the, corinthian, war, 394, 386, bc, which, although, it, ended, inconclusively, helped, athens, regain, its, independence, from, sparta, the, peloponnesian, war, changed, the, ancient, greek, world, athens, the, strongest, city, state, in, greece, prior, to, the, war, was, reduced, to, a, state, of, near, complete, subjection, while, sparta, became, established, as, the, leading, power, of, greece, the, economic, costs, of, the, war, were, felt, all, across, greece, poverty, became, widespread, in, the, peloponnese, while, athens, was, devastated, and, never, regained, its, pre, war, prosperity, the, war, also, wrought, subtler, changes, to, greek, society, the, conflict, between, democratic, athens, and, oligarchic, sparta, each, of, which, supported, friendly, political, factions, within, other, states, made, war, a, common, occurrence, in, the, greek, world, ancient, greek, warfare, originally, a, limited, and, formalized, form, of, conflict, was, transformed, into, an, all, out, struggle, between, city, states, complete, with, mass, atrocities, shattering, religious, and, cultural, taboos, devastating, vast, swathes, of, countryside, and, destroying, whole, cities, the, peloponnesian, war, marked, the, dramatic, end, to, the, fifth, century, bc, and, the, golden, age, of, greece, the, main, historical, source, for, most, of, the, war, is, the, detailed, account, in, the, history, of, the, peloponnesian, war, by, thucydides, he, states, that, he, began, writing, his, history, as, soon, as, the, war, broke, out, and, took, his, information, from, first, hand, accounts, including, events, he, witnessed, himself, an, athenian, who, fought, in, the, early, part, of, the, war, thucydides, was, exiled, in, 423, bc, and, settled, in, the, peloponnese, where, he, spent, the, rest, of, the, war, collecting, sources, and, writing, his, history, scholars, regard, thucydides, as, reliable, and, neutral, between, the, two, sides, a, partial, exception, are, the, lengthy, speeches, he, reports, which, thucydides, admits, are, not, accurate, records, of, what, was, said, but, his, interpretation, of, the, general, arguments, presented, the, narrative, begins, several, years, before, the, war, explaining, why, it, began, then, reports, events, year, by, year, the, main, limitation, of, thucydides, work, is, that, it, is, incomplete, the, text, ends, abruptly, in, 411, bc, seven, years, before, the, conclusion, of, the, war, the, account, was, continued, by, xenophon, a, younger, contemporary, in, the, first, book, of, his, hellenica, this, directly, follows, thucydides, final, sentence, and, provides, a, similar, record, on, the, topics, of, the, war, s, conclusion, and, aftermath, born, in, athens, xenophon, spent, his, military, career, as, a, mercenary, fighting, in, the, persian, empire, and, for, sparta, in, asia, minor, thrace, and, greece, exiled, from, athens, for, these, actions, he, retired, to, live, in, sparta, where, he, wrote, hellenica, around, 40, years, after, the, war, had, ended, his, account, is, generally, considered, favourable, to, sparta, a, briefer, account, of, the, whole, war, is, provided, by, the, sicilian, historian, diodorus, siculus, in, books, 12, and, 13, of, his, bibliotheca, historica, written, in, the, first, century, bc, these, books, appear, to, be, based, heavily, possibly, entirely, upon, an, earlier, universal, history, by, ephorus, written, in, the, century, after, the, war, which, is, now, lost, the, roman, greek, historian, plutarch, wrote, biographies, of, four, of, the, major, commanders, in, the, war, pericles, nicias, alcibiades, and, lysander, in, his, parallel, lives, plutarch, s, focus, was, on, the, character, and, morality, of, these, men, but, he, does, provide, some, details, on, the, progress, of, the, war, that, are, not, recorded, elsewhere, written, in, the, first, century, ad, plutarch, based, his, work, on, earlier, accounts, which, are, now, lost, more, limited, information, on, the, war, is, derived, from, epigraphy, and, archaeology, such, as, the, walls, of, amphipolis, and, grave, of, brasidas, excavated, in, the, 20th, century, some, buildings, and, artworks, produced, during, the, war, have, survived, such, as, the, erechtheion, temple, and, grave, stele, of, hegeso, both, in, athens, these, provide, no, information, on, military, activity, but, do, reflect, civilian, life, during, the, war, several, plays, by, the, athenian, aristophanes, were, written, and, set, during, the, war, particularly, peace, and, lysistrata, but, these, are, works, of, comedic, fiction, with, little, historical, value, thucydides, summarised, the, situation, before, the, war, as, the, growth, of, the, power, of, athens, and, the, alarm, which, this, inspired, in, lacedaemon, made, war, inevitable, the, nearly, 50, years, before, the, war, had, been, marked, by, the, development, of, athens, as, a, major, power, in, the, mediterranean, world, its, empire, began, as, a, small, group, of, city, states, called, the, delian, league, from, the, island, of, delos, on, which, they, kept, their, treasury, that, formed, to, ensure, that, the, greco, persian, wars, were, over, after, defeating, the, second, persian, invasion, of, greece, in, the, year, 480, bc, athens, led, the, coalition, of, greek, city, states, that, continued, the, greco, persian, wars, with, attacks, on, persian, territories, in, the, aegean, and, ionia, what, ensued, was, a, period, which, thucydides, called, the, pentecontaetia, in, which, athens, increasingly, became, an, empire, carrying, out, an, aggressive, war, against, persia, and, increasingly, dominating, other, city, states, athens, brought, under, its, control, all, of, greece, except, for, sparta, and, its, allies, ushering, in, a, period, now, called, the, athenian, empire, by, mid, century, the, persians, had, been, driven, out, of, the, aegean, and, had, ceded, control, of, vast, territories, to, athens, athens, had, greatly, increased, its, own, power, a, number, of, its, formerly, independent, allies, were, reduced, over, the, course, of, the, century, to, the, status, of, tribute, paying, subject, states, of, the, delian, league, this, tribute, was, used, to, fund, a, powerful, fleet, and, after, the, middle, of, the, century, massive, public, works, in, athens, causing, resentment, friction, between, athens, and, the, peloponnesian, states, including, sparta, began, early, in, the, pentecontaetia, in, the, wake, of, the, departure, of, the, persians, from, greece, sparta, sent, ambassadors, to, persuade, athens, not, to, reconstruct, their, walls, but, was, rebuffed, without, the, walls, athens, would, have, been, defenseless, against, a, land, attack, and, subject, to, spartan, control, according, to, thucydides, although, the, spartans, took, no, action, then, they, secretly, felt, aggrieved, conflict, between, the, states, flared, up, again, in, 465, bc, when, a, helot, revolt, broke, out, in, sparta, the, spartans, summoned, forces, from, all, of, their, allies, including, athens, to, help, them, suppress, the, revolt, athens, sent, out, a, sizable, contingent, 4, 000, hoplites, but, upon, its, arrival, this, force, was, dismissed, by, the, spartans, while, those, of, all, the, other, allies, were, permitted, to, remain, according, to, thucydides, the, spartans, did, this, out, of, fear, that, the, athenians, would, switch, sides, and, support, the, helots, the, offended, athenians, repudiated, their, alliance, with, sparta, when, the, rebellious, helots, were, finally, forced, to, surrender, and, permitted, to, evacuate, the, state, the, athenians, settled, them, at, the, strategic, city, of, naupaktos, on, the, gulf, of, corinth, in, 459, bc, there, was, a, war, between, spartan, allies, megara, and, corinth, which, were, neighbors, of, athens, athens, took, advantage, of, the, war, to, make, an, alliance, with, megara, giving, athens, a, critical, foothold, on, the, isthmus, of, corinth, a, 15, year, conflict, commonly, known, as, the, first, peloponnesian, war, ensued, in, which, athens, fought, intermittently, against, sparta, corinth, aegina, and, a, number, of, other, states, for, a, time, during, this, conflict, athens, controlled, not, only, megara, but, also, boeotia, but, at, its, end, a, massive, spartan, invasion, of, attica, forced, athens, to, cede, the, lands, it, had, won, on, the, greek, mainland, and, athens, and, sparta, recognized, each, other, s, right, to, control, their, respective, alliance, systems, the, war, was, officially, ended, by, the, thirty, years, peace, signed, in, the, winter, of, 446, 5, bc, the, thirty, years, peace, was, first, tested, in, 440, bc, when, athens, s, powerful, ally, samos, rebelled, from, its, alliance, with, athens, the, rebels, quickly, secured, the, support, of, a, persian, satrap, and, athens, faced, the, prospect, of, revolts, throughout, its, empire, the, spartans, whose, intervention, would, have, been, the, trigger, for, a, massive, war, to, determine, the, fate, of, the, empire, called, a, congress, of, their, allies, to, discuss, the, possibility, of, war, with, athens, sparta, s, powerful, ally, corinth, was, notably, opposed, to, intervention, and, the, congress, voted, against, war, with, athens, the, athenians, crushed, the, revolt, and, peace, was, maintained, the, more, immediate, events, that, led, to, war, involved, athens, and, corinth, after, a, defeat, by, their, colony, of, corcyra, a, sea, power, that, was, not, allied, to, either, sparta, or, athens, corinth, began, to, build, an, allied, naval, force, alarmed, corcyra, sought, alliance, with, athens, athens, discussed, with, both, corcyra, and, corinth, and, made, a, defensive, alliance, with, corcyra, at, the, battle, of, sybota, a, small, contingent, of, athenian, ships, played, a, critical, role, in, preventing, a, corinthian, fleet, from, capturing, corcyra, in, order, to, uphold, the, thirty, years, peace, the, athenians, were, instructed, not, to, intervene, in, the, battle, unless, it, was, clear, that, corinth, would, invade, corcyra, however, the, athenian, ships, participated, in, the, battle, and, the, arrival, of, additional, athenian, triremes, was, enough, to, dissuade, the, corinthians, from, exploiting, their, victory, thus, sparing, much, of, the, routed, corcyrean, and, athenian, fleet, following, this, athens, instructed, potidaea, in, the, peninsula, of, chalkidiki, a, tributary, ally, of, athens, but, a, colony, of, corinth, to, tear, down, its, walls, send, hostages, to, athens, dismiss, the, corinthian, magistrates, from, office, and, refuse, the, magistrates, that, corinth, would, send, in, the, future, outraged, the, corinthians, encouraged, potidaea, to, revolt, and, assured, them, that, they, would, ally, with, them, should, they, revolt, from, athens, during, the, subsequent, battle, of, potidaea, the, corinthians, unofficially, aided, potidaea, by, sneaking, contingents, of, men, into, the, besieged, city, to, help, defend, it, this, directly, violated, the, thirty, years, peace, which, stipulated, that, the, delian, league, and, the, peloponnesian, league, would, respect, each, other, s, autonomy, and, internal, affairs, a, further, provocation, was, athens, in, 433, 2, bc, imposing, trade, sanctions, on, megarian, citizens, once, more, a, spartan, ally, after, the, first, peloponnesian, war, it, was, alleged, that, the, megarians, had, desecrated, the, hiera, orgas, these, sanctions, known, as, the, megarian, decree, were, largely, ignored, by, thucydides, but, some, modern, economic, historians, have, noted, that, forbidding, megara, to, trade, with, the, prosperous, athenian, empire, would, have, been, disastrous, for, the, megarans, and, so, have, considered, the, sanctions, a, contributing, causing, of, the, war, historians, who, attribute, responsibility, for, the, war, to, athens, cite, this, event, as, the, main, cause, at, the, request, of, corinth, the, spartans, summoned, members, of, the, peloponnesian, league, to, sparta, in, 432, bc, especially, those, who, had, grievances, with, athens, to, make, their, complaints, to, the, spartan, assembly, this, debate, was, also, attended, by, an, uninvited, delegation, from, athens, which, also, asked, to, speak, and, became, the, scene, of, a, debate, between, the, athenians, and, the, corinthians, thucydides, reports, that, the, corinthians, condemned, sparta, s, inactivity, until, then, warning, sparta, that, if, it, remained, passive, it, would, soon, be, outflanked, and, without, allies, in, response, the, athenians, reminded, the, spartans, of, athens, s, record, of, military, success, and, opposition, to, persia, warned, them, of, confronting, such, a, powerful, state, and, encouraged, sparta, to, seek, arbitration, as, provided, by, the, thirty, years, peace, the, spartan, king, archidamus, ii, spoke, against, the, war, but, the, opinion, of, the, hawkish, ephor, sthenelaidas, prevailed, in, the, spartan, ecclesia, a, majority, of, the, spartan, assembly, voted, to, declare, that, the, athenians, had, broken, the, peace, essentially, declaring, war, the, first, years, of, the, peloponnesian, war, are, known, as, the, archidamian, war, 431, 421, bc, after, sparta, s, king, archidamus, ii, sparta, and, its, allies, except, for, corinth, were, almost, exclusively, land, based, and, able, to, summon, large, armies, which, were, nearly, unbeatable, thanks, to, the, legendary, spartan, forces, the, athenian, empire, although, based, in, the, peninsula, of, attica, spread, out, across, the, islands, of, the, aegean, sea, athens, drew, its, immense, wealth, from, tribute, paid, by, these, islands, athens, maintained, its, empire, through, naval, power, thus, the, two, powers, were, relatively, unable, to, fight, decisive, battles, the, spartan, strategy, during, the, archidamian, war, was, to, invade, the, land, around, athens, while, this, invasion, deprived, athenians, of, the, productive, land, around, their, city, athens, maintained, access, to, the, sea, and, did, not, suffer, much, many, of, the, citizens, of, attica, abandoned, their, farms, and, moved, inside, the, long, walls, which, connected, athens, to, its, port, of, piraeus, at, the, end, of, the, first, year, of, the, war, pericles, gave, his, famous, funeral, oration, 431, bc, the, spartans, also, occupied, attica, for, periods, of, only, three, weeks, at, a, time, in, the, tradition, of, earlier, hoplite, warfare, the, soldiers, were, expected, to, go, home, to, participate, in, the, harvest, moreover, spartan, slaves, known, as, helots, needed, to, be, kept, under, control, and, could, not, be, left, unsupervised, for, long, the, longest, spartan, invasion, in, 430, bc, lasted, just, 40, days, the, athenian, strategy, was, initially, guided, by, the, strategos, or, general, pericles, who, advised, the, athenians, to, avoid, open, battle, with, the, far, more, numerous, and, better, trained, spartan, hoplites, relying, instead, on, the, fleet, the, athenian, fleet, the, dominant, greek, naval, force, went, on, the, offensive, winning, at, naupactus, in, 430, bc, an, outbreak, of, a, plague, hit, athens, the, plague, ravaged, the, densely, packed, city, and, in, the, long, run, was, a, significant, cause, of, its, final, defeat, the, plague, wiped, out, over, 30, 000, citizens, sailors, and, soldiers, including, pericles, and, his, sons, roughly, one, third, to, two, thirds, of, the, athenian, population, died, athenian, manpower, was, correspondingly, drastically, reduced, and, even, foreign, mercenaries, refused, to, hire, themselves, out, to, a, city, riddled, with, plague, the, fear, of, plague, was, so, widespread, that, the, spartan, invasion, of, attica, was, abandoned, their, troops, being, unwilling, to, risk, contact, with, the, diseased, enemy, after, the, death, of, pericles, the, athenians, turned, somewhat, against, his, conservative, defensive, strategy, and, to, the, more, aggressive, strategy, of, bringing, the, war, to, sparta, and, its, allies, rising, to, particular, importance, in, athenian, democracy, at, this, time, was, cleon, a, leader, of, the, hawkish, elements, of, the, athenian, democracy, led, militarily, by, a, clever, new, general, demosthenes, not, to, be, confused, with, the, later, athenian, orator, demosthenes, the, athenians, managed, some, successes, as, they, continued, their, naval, raids, on, the, peloponnese, athens, stretched, their, military, activities, into, boeotia, and, aetolia, quelled, the, mytilenean, revolt, and, began, fortifying, posts, around, the, peloponnese, one, of, these, posts, was, near, pylos, on, a, tiny, island, called, sphacteria, where, the, first, war, turned, in, athens, s, favor, the, post, off, pylos, exploited, sparta, s, dependence, on, the, helots, slaves, who, worked, the, fields, while, its, citizens, trained, to, be, soldiers, the, pylos, post, began, attracting, helot, runaways, in, addition, the, fear, of, a, revolt, of, helots, emboldened, by, the, nearby, athenians, drove, the, spartans, to, attack, the, post, demosthenes, outmaneuvered, the, spartans, in, the, battle, of, pylos, in, 425, bc, and, trapped, a, group, of, spartan, soldiers, on, sphacteria, as, he, waited, for, them, to, surrender, but, weeks, later, he, proved, unable, to, finish, them, off, instead, the, inexperienced, cleon, boasted, in, the, assembly, that, he, could, end, the, affair, and, did, win, a, great, victory, at, the, battle, of, sphacteria, in, a, shocking, turn, of, events, 300, spartan, hoplites, encircled, by, athenian, forces, surrendered, the, spartan, image, of, invincibility, took, significant, damage, the, athenians, jailed, sphacterian, hostages, in, athens, and, resolved, to, execute, the, captured, spartans, if, a, peloponnesian, army, invaded, attica, again, after, these, battles, the, spartan, general, brasidas, raised, an, army, of, allies, and, helots, and, marched, the, length, of, greece, to, the, athenian, colony, of, amphipolis, in, thrace, amphipolis, controlled, several, nearby, silver, mines, whose, that, supplied, much, of, the, athenian, war, fund, a, force, led, by, thucydides, was, dispatched, but, arrived, too, late, to, stop, brasidas, capturing, amphipolis, thucydides, was, exiled, for, this, and, as, a, result, had, conversations, with, both, sides, of, the, war, which, inspired, him, to, record, its, history, both, brasidas, and, cleon, were, killed, in, athenian, efforts, to, retake, amphipolis, see, battle, of, amphipolis, the, spartans, and, athenians, agreed, to, exchange, the, hostages, for, the, towns, captured, by, brasidas, and, signed, a, truce, with, the, death, of, cleon, and, brasidas, both, zealous, war, hawks, for, their, nations, the, peace, of, nicias, was, able, to, last, six, years, however, it, was, a, time, of, constant, skirmishes, in, and, around, the, peloponnese, while, the, spartans, refrained, from, action, themselves, some, of, their, allies, began, to, talk, of, revolt, they, were, supported, in, this, by, argos, a, powerful, peloponnesian, state, that, had, remained, independent, of, lacedaemon, with, the, support, of, the, athenians, the, argives, forged, a, coalition, of, democratic, states, in, the, peloponnese, including, the, powerful, states, of, mantinea, and, elis, early, spartan, attempts, to, break, up, the, coalition, failed, and, the, leadership, of, the, spartan, king, agis, was, called, into, question, emboldened, the, argives, and, their, allies, with, the, support, of, a, small, athenian, force, under, alcibiades, moved, to, seize, the, city, of, tegea, near, sparta, the, battle, of, mantinea, was, the, largest, land, battle, within, greece, during, the, peloponnesian, war, the, lacedaemonians, with, their, neighbors, the, tegeans, faced, the, combined, armies, of, argos, athens, mantinea, and, arcadia, in, the, battle, the, allied, coalition, scored, early, successes, but, failed, to, capitalize, on, them, which, allowed, the, spartan, elite, forces, to, defeat, them, the, result, was, a, complete, victory, for, the, spartans, which, rescued, their, city, from, the, brink, of, strategic, defeat, the, democratic, alliance, was, broken, up, and, most, of, its, members, were, reincorporated, into, the, peloponnesian, league, with, its, victory, at, mantinea, sparta, pulled, itself, back, from, the, brink, of, utter, defeat, and, re, established, its, hegemony, throughout, the, peloponnese, in, the, summer, of, 416, bc, during, a, truce, with, sparta, athens, invaded, the, neutral, island, of, melos, and, demanded, that, melos, ally, with, them, against, sparta, or, be, destroyed, the, melians, rejected, this, so, the, athenian, army, laid, siege, to, their, city, and, eventually, captured, it, in, the, winter, after, the, city, s, fall, the, athenians, executed, all, the, adult, men, and, sold, the, women, and, children, into, slavery, in, the, 17th, year, of, the, war, word, came, to, athens, that, one, of, their, distant, allies, in, sicily, was, under, attack, from, syracuse, the, main, city, of, sicily, the, people, of, syracuse, were, ethnically, dorian, as, were, the, spartans, while, the, athenians, and, their, ally, in, sicilia, were, ionian, the, athenians, felt, obliged, to, help, their, ally, they, also, held, visions, rallied, on, by, alcibiades, who, ultimately, led, an, expedition, of, conquering, all, of, sicily, syracuse, was, not, much, smaller, than, athens, and, conquering, all, of, sicily, would, bring, athens, immense, resources, in, the, final, preparations, for, departure, the, hermai, religious, statues, of, athens, were, mutilated, by, unknown, persons, and, alcibiades, was, charged, with, religious, crimes, alcibiades, demanded, that, he, be, put, on, trial, at, once, so, that, he, could, defend, himself, before, the, expedition, however, the, athenians, allowed, alcibiades, to, go, on, the, expedition, without, being, tried, many, believed, in, order, to, better, plot, against, him, after, arriving, in, sicily, alcibiades, was, recalled, to, athens, for, trial, fearing, that, he, would, be, unjustly, condemned, alcibiades, defected, to, sparta, and, nicias, was, placed, in, charge, of, the, mission, after, his, defection, alcibiades, claimed, to, the, spartans, that, the, athenians, planned, to, use, sicily, as, a, springboard, for, the, conquest, of, all, of, italy, and, carthage, and, to, use, the, resources, and, soldiers, from, these, new, conquests, to, conquer, the, peloponnese, the, athenian, force, consisted, of, over, 100, ships, and, some, 5, 000, infantry, and, light, armored, troops, cavalry, was, limited, to, about, 30, horses, which, proved, to, be, no, match, for, the, large, and, highly, trained, syracusan, cavalry, upon, landing, in, sicily, several, cities, immediately, joined, the, athenian, cause, but, instead, of, attacking, nicias, procrastinated, and, the, campaigning, season, of, 415, bc, ended, with, syracuse, scarcely, damaged, with, winter, approaching, the, athenians, withdrew, into, their, quarters, and, spent, the, winter, gathering, allies, the, delay, allowed, syracuse, to, request, help, from, sparta, who, sent, their, general, gylippus, to, sicily, with, reinforcements, upon, arriving, he, raised, a, force, from, several, sicilian, cities, and, went, to, the, relief, of, syracuse, he, took, command, of, the, syracusan, troops, and, in, a, series, of, battles, defeated, the, athenian, forces, and, prevented, them, from, invading, the, city, nicias, then, sent, word, to, athens, asking, for, reinforcements, demosthenes, was, chosen, and, led, another, fleet, to, sicily, joining, his, forces, with, those, of, nicias, more, battles, ensued, and, again, the, syracusans, and, their, allies, defeated, the, athenians, demosthenes, argued, for, a, retreat, to, athens, but, nicias, at, first, refused, after, additional, setbacks, nicias, seemed, to, agree, to, a, retreat, until, a, bad, omen, in, the, form, of, a, lunar, eclipse, delayed, withdrawal, the, delay, was, costly, and, forced, the, athenians, into, a, major, sea, battle, in, the, great, harbor, of, syracuse, the, athenians, were, thoroughly, defeated, nicias, and, demosthenes, marched, their, remaining, forces, inland, in, search, of, friendly, allies, the, syracusan, cavalry, rode, them, down, mercilessly, eventually, killing, or, enslaving, all, who, were, left, of, the, mighty, athenian, fleet, the, lacedaemonians, were, not, content, with, simply, sending, aid, to, sicily, they, also, resolved, to, take, the, war, to, the, athenians, on, the, advice, of, alcibiades, they, fortified, decelea, near, athens, and, prevented, the, athenians, from, making, use, of, their, land, year, round, the, fortification, of, decelea, prevented, overland, supplies, to, athens, and, forced, all, supplies, to, be, brought, in, by, sea, at, greater, expense, more, significantly, the, nearby, silver, mines, were, totally, disrupted, with, as, many, as, 20, 000, athenian, slaves, freed, by, the, spartan, hoplites, at, decelea, with, the, treasury, and, emergency, reserve, of, 1, 000, talents, dwindling, the, athenians, were, forced, to, demand, even, more, tribute, from, her, subject, allies, further, increasing, tensions, and, the, threat, of, rebellion, within, the, empire, corinth, sparta, and, others, in, the, peloponnesian, league, sent, more, reinforcements, to, syracuse, to, drive, off, the, athenians, but, instead, of, withdrawing, the, athenians, sent, another, hundred, ships, and, another, 5, 000, troops, to, sicily, under, gylippus, the, syracusans, and, their, allies, decisively, defeated, the, athenians, on, land, and, gylippus, encouraged, the, syracusans, to, build, a, navy, which, defeated, the, athenian, fleet, when, they, tried, to, withdraw, the, athenian, army, tried, to, withdraw, overland, to, friendlier, sicilian, cities, but, was, divided, and, defeated, the, entire, athenian, fleet, was, destroyed, and, virtually, the, entire, athenian, army, was, sold, into, slavery, following, the, defeat, of, the, athenians, in, sicily, it, was, widely, believed, that, the, end, of, the, athenian, empire, was, at, hand, their, treasury, was, nearly, empty, its, docks, were, depleted, and, many, of, the, athenian, youth, were, dead, or, imprisoned, in, a, foreign, land, after, the, destruction, of, the, sicilian, expedition, lacedaemon, encouraged, the, revolt, of, athens, s, tributary, allies, and, indeed, much, of, ionia, rose, in, revolt, the, syracusans, sent, their, fleet, to, the, peloponnesians, and, the, persians, decided, to, support, the, spartans, with, money, and, ships, revolt, and, faction, threatened, in, athens, itself, the, athenians, managed, to, survive, for, several, reasons, first, their, foes, lacked, initiative, corinth, and, syracuse, were, slow, to, bring, their, fleets, into, the, aegean, and, sparta, s, other, allies, were, also, slow, to, furnish, troops, or, ships, the, ionian, states, that, rebelled, expected, protection, and, many, rejoined, the, athenian, side, the, persians, were, slow, to, send, promised, funds, and, ships, frustrating, battle, plans, at, the, start, of, the, war, the, athenians, had, prudently, put, aside, some, money, and, 100, ships, that, were, to, be, used, only, as, a, last, resort, these, ships, were, then, released, and, served, as, the, core, of, the, athenians, fleet, throughout, the, rest, of, the, war, an, oligarchical, revolution, occurred, in, athens, in, which, a, group, of, 400, seized, power, peace, with, sparta, might, have, been, possible, but, the, athenian, fleet, now, based, on, the, island, of, samos, refused, the, change, in, 411, bc, this, fleet, engaged, the, spartans, at, the, battle, of, syme, the, fleet, appointed, alcibiades, their, leader, and, continued, the, war, in, athens, s, name, their, opposition, led, to, the, reinstitution, of, a, democratic, government, in, athens, within, two, years, alcibiades, while, condemned, as, a, traitor, still, carried, weight, in, athens, he, prevented, the, athenian, fleet, from, attacking, athens, instead, he, helped, restore, democracy, by, more, subtle, pressure, he, also, persuaded, the, athenian, fleet, to, attack, the, spartans, at, the, battle, of, cyzicus, in, 410, in, the, battle, the, athenians, obliterated, the, spartan, fleet, and, succeeded, in, re, establishing, the, financial, basis, of, the, athenian, empire, between, 410, and, 406, athens, won, a, continuous, string, of, victories, and, eventually, recovered, large, portions, of, its, empire, all, of, this, was, due, in, no, small, part, to, alcibiades, from, 414, bc, darius, ii, ruler, of, the, achaemenid, empire, had, started, to, resent, increasing, athenian, power, in, the, aegean, he, had, his, satrap, tissaphernes, make, alliance, with, sparta, against, athens, in, 412, bc, this, led, to, the, persian, reconquest, of, most, of, ionia, tissaphernes, also, helped, fund, the, peloponnesian, fleet, facing, the, resurgence, of, athens, from, 408, bc, darius, ii, decided, to, continue, the, war, against, athens, and, give, stronger, support, to, the, spartans, he, sent, his, son, cyrus, the, younger, into, asia, minor, as, satrap, of, lydia, phrygia, major, and, cappadocia, and, general, commander, karanos, of, the, persian, troops, there, cyrus, allied, with, the, spartan, general, lysander, in, him, cyrus, found, a, man, willing, to, help, him, become, king, just, as, lysander, himself, hoped, to, become, absolute, ruler, of, greece, by, the, aid, of, the, persian, prince, thus, cyrus, put, all, his, means, at, the, disposal, of, lysander, in, the, peloponnesian, war, when, cyrus, was, recalled, to, susa, by, his, dying, father, darius, he, gave, lysander, the, revenues, from, all, of, his, cities, of, asia, minor, cyrus, the, younger, would, later, obtain, the, support, of, the, spartans, in, return, after, having, asked, them, to, show, themselves, as, good, friend, to, him, as, he, had, been, to, them, during, their, war, against, athens, when, he, led, his, own, expedition, to, susa, in, 401, bc, in, order, to, topple, his, brother, artaxerxes, ii, the, faction, hostile, to, alcibiades, triumphed, in, athens, following, a, minor, spartan, victory, by, their, skillful, general, lysander, at, the, naval, battle, of, notium, in, 406, bc, alcibiades, was, not, re, elected, general, by, the, athenians, and, he, exiled, himself, from, the, city, he, would, never, again, lead, athenians, in, battle, athens, won, the, naval, battle, of, arginusae, the, spartan, fleet, under, callicratidas, lost, 70, ships, and, the, athenians, lost, 25, ships, but, due, to, bad, weather, the, athenians, were, unable, to, rescue, their, stranded, crews, or, finish, off, the, spartan, fleet, despite, their, victory, these, failures, caused, outrage, in, athens, and, led, to, a, controversial, trial, the, trial, resulted, in, the, execution, of, six, of, athens, s, top, naval, commanders, athens, s, naval, supremacy, would, now, be, challenged, without, several, of, its, most, able, military, leaders, and, a, demoralized, navy, unlike, some, of, his, predecessors, the, new, spartan, general, lysander, was, not, a, member, of, the, spartan, royal, families, and, was, also, formidable, in, naval, strategy, he, was, an, artful, diplomat, who, had, even, cultivated, good, personal, relationships, with, the, achaemenid, prince, cyrus, the, younger, son, of, emperor, darius, ii, seizing, its, opportunity, the, spartan, fleet, sailed, at, once, to, the, dardanelles, the, source, of, athens, s, grain, threatened, with, starvation, the, athenian, fleet, had, no, choice, but, to, follow, through, cunning, strategy, lysander, totally, defeated, the, athenian, fleet, in, 405, bc, at, the, battle, of, aegospotami, destroying, 168, ships, only, 12, athenian, ships, escaped, and, several, of, these, sailed, to, cyprus, carrying, the, strategos, general, conon, who, was, anxious, not, to, face, the, judgment, of, the, assembly, facing, starvation, and, disease, from, the, prolonged, siege, athens, surrendered, in, 404, bc, and, its, allies, soon, surrendered, as, well, the, democrats, at, samos, loyal, to, the, bitter, last, held, on, slightly, longer, and, were, allowed, to, flee, with, their, lives, the, surrender, stripped, athens, of, its, walls, its, fleet, and, all, of, its, overseas, possessions, corinth, and, thebes, demanded, that, athens, should, be, destroyed, and, all, its, citizens, should, be, enslaved, however, the, spartans, announced, their, refusal, to, destroy, a, city, that, had, done, a, good, service, at, a, time, of, greatest, danger, to, greece, and, took, athens, into, their, own, system, athens, was, to, have, the, same, friends, and, enemies, as, sparta, the, overall, effect, of, the, war, in, greece, proper, was, to, replace, the, athenian, empire, with, a, spartan, empire, after, the, battle, of, aegospotami, sparta, took, over, the, athenian, empire, and, kept, all, its, tribute, revenues, for, itself, sparta, s, allies, who, had, made, greater, sacrifices, in, the, war, than, had, sparta, got, nothing, for, a, short, time, athens, was, ruled, by, the, thirty, tyrants, a, reactionary, regime, set, up, by, sparta, in, 403, bc, the, oligarchs, were, overthrown, and, a, democracy, was, restored, by, thrasybulus, although, the, hegemony, of, athens, was, broken, the, attic, city, completed, the, recovery, of, its, autonomy, in, the, corinthian, war, and, continued, to, play, an, active, role, in, greek, politics, sparta, was, later, defeated, by, thebes, at, the, battle, of, leuctra, in, 371, bc, a, few, decades, later, the, rivalry, between, athens, and, sparta, ended, when, macedonia, became, the, most, powerful, entity, in, greece, and, philip, ii, of, macedon, unified, all, of, the, greek, world, except, sparta, which, was, later, subjugated, by, philip, s, son, alexander, in, 331, bc, a, symbolic, peace, treaty, was, signed, by, the, mayors, of, modern, athens, and, sparta, 2, 500, years, after, the, war, ended, on, march, 12, 1996
