targets, of, the, campaign, are, militant, islamist, movements, like, al, qaeda, taliban, and, their, allies, other, major, targets, included, the, ba, athist, regime, in, iraq, which, was, deposed, in, an, invasion, in, 2003, and, various, militant, factions, that, fought, during, the, ensuing, insurgency, after, its, territorial, expansion, in, 2014, the, islamic, state, militia, has, also, emerged, as, a, key, adversary, of, the, united, states, as, for, al, qaeda, in, its, current, status, former, secretary, of, state, mike, pompeo, issued, an, official, statement, on, january, 12, 2021, stating, al, qaeda, has, a, new, base, of, operations, it, is, the, islamic, republic, of, iran, al, qaeda, s, de, facto, leader, saif, al, adel, is, currently, believed, to, be, living, in, iran, between, late, 2023, and, 2024, following, the, spillover, of, the, israel, hamas, war, and, the, eventual, red, sea, crisis, the, houthis, have, been, re, designated, as, specially, designated,

metaphor, to, describe, a, variety, of, actions, which, fall, outside, the, traditional, definition, of, war, u, s, president, george, w, bush, first, used, the, term, war, on, terrorism, on, 16, september, 2001, and, then, war, on, terror, a, few, days, later, in, a, formal, speech, to, congress, bush, indicated, the, enemy, of, the, war, on, terror, as, a, radical, network, of, terrorists, and, every, government, that, supports, them, the, initial, conflict, was, aimed, at, al, qaeda, with, the, main, theater, in, afghanistan, and, pakistan, a, region, that, would, later, be, referred, to, as, afpak, the, term, war, on, terror, was, immediately, criticized, by, individuals, including, richard, myers, then, chairman, of, the, joint, chiefs, of, staff, and, eventually, more, nuanced, terms, came, to, be, used, by, the, bush, administration, to, define, the, campaign, while, war, on, terror, was, never, used, as, a, formal, designation, of, u, s, operations, a, global, war, on, terrorism, service, medal, was, and, is, issued, by, the, u, s, armed, forces, as, of, 2023, various, global, operations, in, the, campaign, are, ongoing, including, a, u, s, military, intervention, in, somalia, although, the, major, wars, in, afghanistan, and, iraq, have, ended, the, 2023, hamas, led, attack, on, israel, the, ongoing, israel, hamas, war, the, ongoing, red, sea, crisis, and, iran, s, status, as, a, state, sponsor, of, terrorism, have, led, to, renewed, questions, about, a, new, chapter, of, the, war, on, terror, some, have, commented, that, these, wars, have, reignited, the, rhetoric, of, the, war, on, terror, in, a, way, not, seen, since, the, 2000s, according, to, the, costs, of, war, project, the, post, 9, 11, wars, of, the, campaign, have, displaced, 38, million, people, the, second, largest, number, of, forced, displacements, of, any, conflict, since, 1900, and, caused, more, than, 4, 5, million, deaths, direct, and, indirect, in, afghanistan, iraq, libya, philippines, pakistan, somalia, syria, and, yemen, they, also, estimate, that, it, has, cost, the, us, treasury, over, 8, trillion, while, support, for, the, war, on, terror, was, high, among, the, american, public, during, its, initial, years, it, had, become, deeply, unpopular, by, the, late, 2000s, controversy, over, the, war, has, focused, on, its, morality, casualties, and, continuity, with, critics, questioning, government, measures, that, infringed, civil, liberties, and, human, rights, critics, have, notably, described, the, patriot, act, as, orwellian, due, to, its, substantial, expansion, of, the, federal, government, s, surveillance, powers, controversial, practices, of, coalition, forces, have, been, condemned, including, drone, warfare, surveillance, torture, extraordinary, rendition, and, various, war, crimes, the, participating, governments, have, been, criticized, for, implementing, authoritarian, measures, repressing, minorities, fomenting, islamophobia, globally, and, causing, negative, impacts, to, health, and, environment, security, analysts, assert, that, there, is, no, military, solution, to, the, conflict, pointing, out, that, terrorism, is, not, an, identifiable, enemy, and, have, emphasized, the, importance, of, negotiations, and, political, solutions, to, resolve, the, underlying, roots, of, the, crises, the, phrase, war, on, terror, was, used, to, refer, specifically, to, the, military, campaign, led, by, the, united, states, the, united, kingdom, and, allied, countries, against, organizations, and, regimes, identified, by, them, as, terrorist, and, usually, excludes, other, independent, counter, terrorist, operations, and, campaigns, such, as, those, by, russia, and, india, the, conflict, has, also, been, referred, to, by, names, other, than, the, war, on, terror, it, has, also, been, known, as, the, phrase, war, against, terrorism, existed, in, north, american, popular, culture, and, u, s, political, parlance, prior, to, the, war, on, terror, but, it, was, not, until, the, 11, september, attacks, that, it, emerged, as, a, globally, recognizable, phrase, and, part, of, everyday, lexicon, tom, brokaw, having, just, witnessed, the, collapse, of, one, of, the, towers, of, the, world, trade, center, declared, terrorists, have, declared, war, on, on, 16, september, 2001, at, camp, david, u, s, president, george, w, bush, used, the, phrase, war, on, terrorism, in, an, ostensibly, unscripted, comment, when, answering, a, journalist, s, question, about, the, impact, of, enhanced, law, enforcement, authority, given, to, the, u, s, surveillance, agencies, on, americans, civil, liberties, this, is, a, new, kind, of, a, new, kind, of, evil, and, we, understand, and, the, american, people, are, beginning, to, understand, this, crusade, this, war, on, terrorism, is, going, to, take, a, while, and, the, american, people, must, be, patient, i, m, going, to, be, patient, the, reference, to, crusades, became, subject, to, heavy, criticism, due, to, its, controversial, connotations, in, the, muslim, world, and, historical, muslim, christian, relations, on, 20, september, 2001, during, a, televised, address, to, a, joint, session, of, congress, george, bush, said, our, war, on, terror, begins, with, al, qaeda, but, it, does, not, end, there, it, will, not, end, until, every, terrorist, group, of, global, reach, has, been, found, stopped, and, defeated, both, the, term, and, the, policies, it, denotes, have, been, a, source, of, ongoing, controversy, as, various, critics, and, organizations, like, amnesty, international, have, argued, that, it, has, been, used, to, justify, unilateral, preventive, war, human, rights, abuses, and, other, violations, of, international, law, the, political, theorist, richard, jackson, has, argued, that, the, war, on, terrorism, is, simultaneously, a, set, of, actual, practices, wars, covert, operations, agencies, and, institutions, and, an, accompanying, series, of, assumptions, beliefs, justifications, and, narratives, it, is, an, entire, language, or, discourse, jackson, cites, among, many, examples, a, statement, by, john, ashcroft, that, the, attacks, of, september, 11, drew, a, bright, line, of, demarcation, between, the, civil, and, the, savage, administration, officials, also, described, terrorists, as, hateful, treacherous, barbarous, mad, twisted, perverted, without, faith, parasitical, inhuman, and, most, commonly, evil, americans, in, contrast, were, described, as, brave, loving, generous, strong, resourceful, heroic, and, respectful, of, human, rights, denouncing, the, remarks, of, george, w, bush, osama, bin, laden, stated, during, an, interview, in, 21, october, 2001, the, events, proved, the, extent, of, terrorism, that, america, exercises, in, the, world, bush, stated, that, the, world, has, to, be, divided, in, two, bush, and, his, supporters, and, any, country, that, doesn, t, get, into, the, global, crusade, is, with, the, terrorists, what, terrorism, is, clearer, than, this, many, governments, were, forced, to, support, this, new, terrorism, in, april, 2007, the, british, government, announced, publicly, that, it, was, abandoning, the, use, of, the, phrase, war, on, terror, as, they, found, it, to, be, less, than, helpful, this, was, explained, more, recently, by, lady, eliza, manningham, buller, in, her, 2011, reith, lecture, the, former, head, of, mi5, said, that, the, 9, 11, attacks, were, a, crime, not, an, act, of, war, so, i, never, felt, it, helpful, to, refer, to, a, war, on, terror, u, s, president, barack, obama, rarely, used, the, term, but, in, his, inaugural, address, on, 20, january, 2009, he, stated, our, nation, is, at, war, against, a, far, reaching, network, of, violence, and, hatred, in, march, 2009, the, defense, department, officially, changed, the, name, of, operations, from, global, war, on, terror, to, overseas, contingency, operation, oco, in, march, 2009, the, obama, administration, requested, that, pentagon, staff, members, avoid, the, use, of, the, term, and, instead, to, use, overseas, contingency, operation, basic, objectives, of, the, bush, administration, war, on, terror, such, as, targeting, al, qaeda, and, building, international, counterterrorism, alliances, remain, in, place, in, may, 2010, the, obama, administration, published, a, report, outlining, its, national, security, strategy, the, document, dropped, the, bush, era, phrase, global, war, on, terror, and, reference, to, islamic, extremism, and, stated, this, is, not, a, global, war, against, a, tactic, terrorism, or, a, religion, islam, we, are, at, war, with, a, specific, network, al, qaeda, and, its, terrorist, affiliates, who, support, efforts, to, attack, the, united, states, our, allies, and, partners, usage, of, the, term, war, on, terror, was, initially, discontinued, in, may, 2010, and, again, in, may, 2013, on, 23, may, 2013, u, s, president, barack, obama, announced, that, the, war, on, terrorism, was, over, saying, that, the, u, s, would, not, wage, war, against, a, tactic, but, would, instead, focus, on, a, specific, group, of, terrorist, networks, other, american, military, campaigns, during, the, 2010s, have, also, been, considered, part, of, the, war, on, terror, by, individuals, and, the, media, the, rise, of, the, islamic, state, in, iraq, and, syria, during, 2014, 2015, led, to, the, global, operation, inherent, resolve, and, an, international, campaign, to, destroy, the, terrorist, organization, this, was, considered, to, be, another, campaign, of, the, war, on, terror, in, december, 2012, jeh, johnson, the, general, counsel, of, the, department, of, defense, speaking, at, oxford, university, stated, that, the, war, against, al, qaeda, would, end, when, the, terrorist, group, had, been, weakened, so, that, it, was, no, longer, capable, of, strategic, attacks, and, had, been, effectively, destroyed, at, that, point, the, war, would, no, longer, be, an, armed, conflict, under, international, law, and, the, military, fight, could, be, replaced, by, a, law, enforcement, operation, in, may, 2013, two, years, after, the, assassination, of, osama, bin, laden, barack, obama, delivered, a, speech, that, employed, the, term, global, war, on, terror, put, in, quotation, marks, as, officially, transcribed, by, the, white, house, now, make, no, mistake, terrorists, still, threaten, our, nation, in, afghanistan, we, will, complete, our, transition, to, afghan, responsibility, for, that, country, s, security, beyond, afghanistan, we, must, define, our, effort, not, as, a, boundless, global, war, on, terror, but, rather, as, a, series, of, persistent, targeted, efforts, to, dismantle, specific, networks, of, violent, extremists, that, threaten, america, in, many, cases, this, will, involve, partnerships, with, other, countries, nevertheless, in, the, same, speech, in, a, bid, to, emphasize, the, legality, of, military, actions, undertaken, by, the, u, s, noting, that, congress, had, authorised, the, use, of, force, he, went, on, to, say, under, domestic, law, and, international, law, the, united, states, is, at, war, with, al, qaeda, the, taliban, and, their, associated, forces, we, are, at, war, with, an, organization, that, right, now, would, kill, as, many, americans, as, they, could, if, we, did, not, stop, them, first, so, this, is, a, just, war, a, war, waged, proportionally, in, last, resort, and, in, self, defense, nonetheless, the, use, of, the, phrase, war, on, terror, persists, in, u, s, politics, in, 2017, for, example, u, s, vice, president, mike, pence, called, the, 1983, beirut, barracks, bombing, the, opening, salvo, in, a, war, that, we, have, waged, ever, since, the, global, war, on, terror, in, may, 1996, the, group, world, islamic, front, for, jihad, against, jews, and, crusaders, wifjajc, sponsored, by, osama, bin, laden, and, later, re, formed, as, al, qaeda, started, forming, a, large, base, of, operations, in, afghanistan, where, the, islamist, extremist, regime, of, the, taliban, had, seized, power, earlier, in, the, year, in, august, 1996, bin, laden, declared, jihad, against, the, united, states, in, february, 1998, osama, bin, laden, signed, a, fatwa, as, head, of, al, qaeda, declaring, war, on, the, west, and, israel, in, may, al, qaeda, released, a, video, declaring, war, on, the, u, s, and, the, west, on, 7, august, 1998, al, qaeda, struck, the, u, s, embassies, in, kenya, and, tanzania, killing, 224, people, including, 12, americans, in, retaliation, u, s, president, bill, clinton, launched, operation, infinite, reach, a, bombing, campaign, in, sudan, and, afghanistan, against, targets, the, u, s, asserted, were, associated, with, wifjajc, although, others, have, questioned, whether, a, pharmaceutical, plant, in, sudan, was, used, as, a, chemical, warfare, facility, the, plant, produced, much, of, the, region, s, antimalarial, drugs, and, around, 50, of, sudan, s, pharmaceutical, needs, the, strikes, failed, to, kill, any, leaders, of, wifjajc, or, the, taliban, next, came, the, 2000, millennium, attack, plots, which, included, an, attempted, bombing, of, los, angeles, international, airport, on, 12, october, 2000, the, uss,

passengers, and, crew, once, their, demands, were, met, no, passenger, and, crew, actually, suspected, that, they, would, use, the, jet, airliners, as, suicide, weapons, since, it, had, never, happened, before, in, history, and, many, previous, hijacking, attempts, had, been, resolved, with, the, passengers, and, crew, escaping, unharmed, after, obeying, the, hijackers, the, hijackers,

european, union, first, identified, by, the, washington, post, are, likely, not, permanent, locations, making, them, difficult, to, identify, and, locate, what, some, believe, was, a, network, of, secret, prisons, was, most, probably, a, series, of, facilities, used, temporarily, by, the, united, states, when, needed, officials, say, interim, black, sites, secret, facilities, used, for, covert,

the, detention, camp, was, set, up, by, the, u, s, government, on, guantanamo, bay, since, the, military, base, is, not, legally, domestic, us, territory, and, thus, was, a, legal, black, hole, most,

pakistan, at, between, 518, 000, and, 549, 000, this, number, increases, to, between, 897, 000, and, 929, 000, when, the, wars, in, syria, yemen, and, other, countries, are, included, the, report,

civil, wars, in, syria, yemen, libya, and, somalia, the, report, derived, its, estimate, of, indirect, deaths, using, a, calculation, from, the, geneva, declaration, of, secretariat, which, estimates, that, for, every, person, directly, killed, by, war, four, more, die, from, the, indirect, consequences, of, war, the, report, s, author, stephanie, savell, stated, that, in, an, ideal, scenario, the, preferable, way, of, quantifying, the, total, death, toll, would, have, been, by, studying, excess, mortality, or, by, using, on, the, ground, researchers, in, the, affected, countries, an, estimated, 7, 052, us, military, combatants, over, 8, 100, us, military, contractors, and, more, than, 14, 800, us, allied, coalition, troops, are, estimated, to, have, been, killed, in, the, wars, as, of, 2023,

total, casualties, in, iraq, range, from, 62, 570, to, 1, 124, 000, insurgent, and, terrorist, deaths, in, afghanistan, are, hard, to, estimate, afghan, taliban, losses, are, most, likely, of, a, similar, scale, to, afghan, national, army, and, police, losses, that, is, around, 62, 000, from, 2001, to, the, end, of, 2018, in, addition, al, qaeda, s, main, branch, and, isil, s, afghanistan,
