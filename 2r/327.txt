the, reconquista, spanish, and, portuguese, for, reconquest, or, the, reconquest, of, al, andalus, was, a, series, of, military, and, cultural, campaigns, that, european, christian, kingdoms, waged, against, the, muslim, kingdoms, following, the, muslim, conquest, of, the, iberian, peninsula, by, the, umayyad, caliphate, culminating, in, the, reign, of, the, catholic, monarchs, of, spain, the, beginning, of, the, reconquista, is, traditionally, dated, to, the, battle, of, covadonga, c, 718, or, 722, in, which, an, asturian, army, achieved, the, first, christian, victory, over, the, forces, of, the, umayyad, caliphate, since, the, beginning, of, the, military, invasion, the, reconquista, ended, in, 1492, with, the, fall, of, the, nasrid, kingdom, of, granada, to, the, catholic, monarchs, in, the, late, 10th, century, the, umayyad, vizier, almanzor, waged, a, series, of, military, campaigns, for, 30, years, in, order, to, subjugate, the, northern, christian, kingdoms, when, the, caliphate, of, c, rdoba, disintegrated, in, the, early, 11th, century, a, series, of, petty, successor, states, known, as, taifas, emerged, the, northern, kingdoms, took, advantage, of, this, situation, and, struck, deep, into, al, andalus, they, fostered, civil, war, intimidated, the, weakened, taifas, and, made, them, pay, large, tributes, parias, for, protection, in, the, 12th, century, the, reconquista, was, above, all, a, political, action, to, develop, the, kingdoms, of, portugal, le, n, castile, and, aragon, the, king, s, action, took, precedence, over, that, of, the, local, lords, with, the, help, of, the, military, orders, and, also, supported, by, repopulation, following, a, muslim, resurgence, under, the, almohads, in, the, 12th, century, the, great, moorish, strongholds, fell, to, christian, forces, in, the, 13th, century, after, the, decisive, battle, of, las, navas, de, tolosa, 1212, the, siege, of, c, rdoba, 1236, and, the, siege, of, seville, 1248, leaving, only, the, muslim, enclave, of, granada, as, a, tributary, state, in, the, south, after, the, surrender, of, granada, in, january, 1492, the, entire, iberian, peninsula, was, controlled, by, christian, rulers, on, 30, july, 1492, as, a, result, of, the, alhambra, decree, the, jewish, communities, in, castile, and, aragon, some, 200, 000, people, were, forcibly, expelled, the, conquest, was, followed, by, a, series, of, edicts, 1499, 1526, which, forced, the, conversions, of, muslims, in, castile, navarre, and, aragon, who, were, later, expelled, from, the, iberian, realms, of, the, spanish, crown, by, a, series, of, decrees, starting, in, 1609, approximately, three, million, muslims, emigrated, or, were, driven, out, of, spain, between, 1492, and, 1610, beginning, in, the, 19th, century, traditional, historiography, has, used, the, term, reconquista, for, what, was, earlier, thought, of, as, a, restoration, of, the, visigothic, kingdom, over, conquered, territories, the, concept, of, reconquista, consolidated, in, spanish, historiography, in, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, was, associated, with, the, development, of, a, spanish, national, identity, emphasizing, spanish, nationalist, and, romantic, aspects, it, is, rememorated, in, the, moros, y, cristianos, festival, very, popular, in, parts, of, southeastern, spain, and, which, can, also, be, found, in, a, few, places, in, former, spanish, colonies, pursuant, to, an, islamophobic, worldview, the, concept, is, a, symbol, of, significance, for, the, 21st, century, european, far, right, the, term, reconquista, used, to, describe, the, struggle, between, christians, and, muslims, in, the, iberian, peninsula, during, the, middle, ages, was, not, used, by, writers, of, the, period, since, its, development, as, a, term, in, medieval, historiography, occurred, centuries, after, the, events, it, references, it, has, acquired, various, meanings, its, meaning, as, an, actual, reconquest, has, been, subject, to, the, particular, concerns, or, prejudices, of, scholars, who, have, sometimes, wielded, it, as, a, weapon, in, ideological, disputes, a, discernible, irredentist, ideology, that, would, later, become, part, of, the, concept, of, reconquista, a, christian, reconquest, of, the, peninsula, appeared, in, writings, by, the, end, of, the, 9th, century, for, example, the, anonymous, christian, chronicle, chronica, prophetica, 883, 884, claimed, a, historical, connection, between, the, visigothic, kingdom, conquered, by, the, muslims, in, 711, and, the, kingdom, of, asturias, in, which, the, document, was, produced, and, stressed, a, christian, and, muslim, cultural, and, religious, divide, in, hispania, and, a, necessity, to, drive, out, the, muslims, and, restore, conquered, territories, in, fact, in, the, writings, of, both, sides, there, was, a, sense, of, divide, based, on, ethnicity, and, culture, between, the, inhabitants, of, the, small, christian, kingdoms, in, the, north, and, the, dominant, elite, in, the, muslim, ruled, south, the, linear, approach, to, the, origins, of, a, reconquista, taken, in, early, twentieth, century, historiography, is, complicated, by, a, number, of, issues, for, example, periods, of, peaceful, coexistence, or, at, least, of, limited, and, localised, skirmishes, on, the, frontiers, were, more, prevalent, over, the, 781, years, of, muslim, rule, in, iberia, than, periods, of, military, conflict, between, the, christian, kingdoms, and, al, andalus, additionally, both, christian, and, muslim, rulers, fought, other, christians, and, muslims, and, cooperation, and, alliances, between, muslims, and, christians, were, not, uncommon, such, as, between, the, arista, dynasty, and, banu, qasi, as, early, as, the, 9th, century, blurring, distinctions, even, further, were, the, mercenaries, from, both, sides, who, simply, fought, for, whoever, paid, the, most, the, period, is, seen, today, to, have, had, long, episodes, of, relative, religious, coexistence, and, tolerance, the, idea, of, a, continuous, reconquista, has, been, challenged, by, modern, scholars, the, crusades, which, started, late, in, the, 11th, century, bred, the, religious, ideology, of, a, christian, reconquest, in, the, years, just, before, the, council, of, clermont, took, place, spanish, kings, used, religious, differences, as, a, reason, to, fight, against, muslims, although, this, argument, was, not, extensively, used, beforehand, in, al, andalus, at, that, time, the, christian, states, were, confronted, by, the, almoravids, and, to, an, even, greater, degree, they, were, confronted, by, the, almohads, who, espoused, a, similarly, staunch, muslim, jihad, ideology, in, fact, previous, documents, which, date, from, the, 10th, and, 11th, centuries, are, mute, on, any, idea, of, reconquest, propaganda, accounts, of, muslim, christian, hostility, came, into, being, to, support, that, idea, most, notably, the, chanson, de, roland, an, 11th, century, french, chanson, de, geste, that, offers, a, fictionalised, retelling, of, the, battle, of, roncevaux, pass, dealing, with, the, iberian, saracens, moors, and, centuries, later, introduced, in, the, french, school, system, with, a, view, to, instilling, moral, and, national, values, in, the, population, following, the, 1870, defeat, of, the, french, in, the, franco, prussian, war, regardless, of, the, actual, events, the, consolidation, of, the, modern, idea, of, a, reconquista, is, inextricably, linked, to, the, foundational, myths, of, spanish, nationalism, in, the, 19th, century, associated, with, the, development, of, a, centralist, castilian, and, staunchly, catholic, brand, of, nationalism, evoking, nationalistic, romantic, and, sometimes, colonialist, themes, the, concept, gained, further, track, in, the, 20th, century, during, the, francoist, dictatorship, it, thus, became, one, of, the, key, tenets, of, the, historiographical, discourse, of, national, catholicism, the, mythological, and, ideological, identity, of, the, regime, the, discourse, was, underpinned, in, its, most, traditional, version, by, an, avowed, historical, illegitimacy, of, al, andalus, and, the, subsequent, glorification, of, the, christian, conquest, the, idea, of, a, liberation, war, of, reconquest, against, the, muslims, who, were, viewed, as, foreigners, suited, the, anti, republican, rebels, during, the, spanish, civil, war, the, rebels, agitated, for, the, banner, of, a, spanish, fatherland, a, fatherland, which, according, to, them, was, being, threatened, by, regional, nationalisms, and, communism, their, rebellious, pursuit, was, thus, a, crusade, for, the, restoration, of, the, church, s, unity, where, franco, stood, for, both, pelagius, of, asturias, and, el, cid, the, reconquista, has, become, a, rallying, call, for, right, and, far, right, parties, in, spain, to, expel, from, office, incumbent, progressive, or, peripheral, nationalist, options, as, well, as, their, values, in, different, political, contexts, as, of, 2018, the, same, kind, of, propaganda, was, circulated, during, the, spanish, civil, war, by, the, republicans, who, wanted, to, portray, their, enemies, as, foreign, invaders, especially, given, the, prominence, of, the, army, of, africa, among, franco, s, troops, an, army, which, was, made, up, of, native, north, african, soldiers, some, contemporary, authors, consider, the, reconquista, proof, that, the, process, of, christian, state, building, in, iberia, was, frequently, defined, by, the, reclamation, of, lands, that, had, been, lost, to, the, moors, in, generations, past, in, this, way, state, building, might, be, characterised, at, least, in, ideological, if, not, practical, terms, as, a, process, by, which, iberian, states, were, being, rebuilt, in, turn, other, recent, historians, dispute, the, whole, concept, of, reconquista, as, a, concept, created, a, posteriori, in, the, service, of, later, political, goals, a, few, historians, point, out, that, spain, and, portugal, did, not, previously, exist, as, nations, and, therefore, the, heirs, of, the, christian, visigothic, kingdom, were, not, technically, re, conquering, them, as, the, name, suggests, one, of, the, first, spanish, intellectuals, to, question, the, idea, of, a, reconquest, that, lasted, for, eight, centuries, was, jos, ortega, y, gasset, writing, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, however, the, term, reconquista, is, still, widely, in, use, in, 711, north, african, berber, soldiers, with, some, arabs, commanded, by, tariq, ibn, ziyad, crossed, the, strait, of, gibraltar, engaging, a, visigothic, force, led, by, king, roderic, at, the,

different, towns, and, strongholds, in, hispania, some, like, m, rida, cordova, or, zaragoza, in, 712, probably, toledo, were, taken, but, many, agreed, to, a, treaty, in, exchange, for, maintaining, autonomy, in, theodemir, s, dominion, region, of, tudmir, or, pamplona, for, example, the, invading, islamic, armies, did, not, exceed, 60, 000, men, after, the, establishment, of, a, local, emirate, caliph, al, walid, i, ruler, of, the, umayyad, caliphate, removed, many, of, the, successful, muslim, commanders, tariq, ibn, ziyad, was, recalled, to, damascus, and, replaced, with, musa, ibn, nusayr, who, had, been, his, former, superior, musa, s, son, abd, al, aziz, ibn, musa, apparently, married, egilona, roderic, s, widow, and, established, his, regional, government, in, seville, he, was, suspected, of, being, under, the, influence, of, his, wife, and, was, accused, of, wanting, to, convert, to, christianity, and, of, planning, a, secessionist, rebellion, apparently, a, concerned, al, walid, i, ordered, abd, al, aziz, s, assassination, caliph, al, walid, i, died, in, 715, and, was, succeeded, by, his, brother, sulayman, ibn, abd, al, malik, sulayman, seems, to, have, punished, the, surviving, musa, ibn, nusayr, who, very, soon, died, during, a, pilgrimage, in, 716, in, the, end, abd, al, aziz, ibn, musa, s, cousin, ayyub, ibn, habib, al, lakhmi, became, the, wali, governor, of, al, andalus, a, serious, weakness, amongst, the, muslim, conquerors, was, the, ethnic, tension, between, berbers, and, arabs, the, berbers, were, indigenous, inhabitants, of, north, africa, who, had, only, recently, converted, to, islam, they, provided, most, of, the, soldiery, of, the, invading, islamic, armies, but, sensed, arab, discrimination, against, them, this, latent, internal, conflict, jeopardised, umayyad, unity, the, umayyad, forces, arrived, and, crossed, the, pyrenees, by, 719, the, last, visigothic, king, ardo, resisted, them, in, septimania, where, he, fended, off, the, berber, arab, armies, until, 720, after, the, islamic, moorish, conquest, of, most, of, the, iberian, peninsula, in, 711, 718, and, the, establishment, of, the, emirate, of, al, andalus, an, umayyad, expedition, suffered, a, major, defeat, at, the, battle, of, toulouse, and, was, halted, for, a, while, on, its, way, north, odo, of, aquitaine, had, married, his, daughter, to, uthman, ibn, naissa, a, rebel, berber, and, lord, of, cerdanya, in, an, attempt, to, secure, his, southern, borders, in, order, to, fend, off, charles, martel, s, attacks, on, the, north, however, a, major, punitive, expedition, led, by, abdul, rahman, al, ghafiqi, the, latest, emir, of, al, andalus, defeated, and, killed, uthman, and, the, muslim, governor, mustered, an, expedition, north, across, the, western, pyrenees, looted, areas, up, to, bordeaux, and, defeated, odo, in, the, battle, of, the, river, garonne, in, 732, a, desperate, odo, turned, to, his, archrival, charles, martel, for, help, who, led, the, frankish, and, remaining, aquitanian, armies, against, the, umayyad, armies, and, defeated, them, at, the, battle, of, poitiers, in, 732, killing, abdul, rahman, al, ghafiqi, while, moorish, rule, began, to, recede, in, what, is, today, france, it, would, remain, in, parts, of, the, iberian, peninsula, for, another, 760, years, a, drastic, increase, of, taxes, on, christians, by, the, emir, anbasa, ibn, suhaym, al, kalbi, provoked, several, rebellions, in, al, andalus, which, a, series, of, succeeding, weak, emirs, were, unable, to, suppress, around, 722, a, muslim, military, expedition, was, sent, into, the, north, in, late, summer, to, suppress, a, rebellion, led, by, pelagius, of, asturias, pelayo, in, spanish, pelayu, in, asturian, traditional, historiography, has, hailed, pelagius, s, victory, at, covadonga, as, the, beginning, of, the, reconquista, two, northern, realms, navarre, and, asturias, despite, their, small, size, demonstrated, an, ability, to, maintain, their, independence, because, the, umayyad, rulers, based, in, c, rdoba, were, unable, to, extend, their, power, over, the, pyrenees, they, decided, to, consolidate, their, power, within, the, iberian, peninsula, arab, berber, forces, made, periodic, incursions, deep, into, asturias, but, this, area, was, a, cul, de, sac, on, the, fringes, of, the, islamic, world, fraught, with, inconveniences, during, campaigns, and, of, little, interest, it, comes, then, as, no, surprise, that, besides, focusing, on, raiding, the, arab, berber, strongholds, of, the, meseta, alfonso, i, of, asturias, centred, on, expanding, his, domains, at, the, expense, of, the, neighbouring, galicians, and, basques, at, either, side, of, his, realm, just, as, much, during, the, first, decades, asturian, control, over, part, of, the, kingdom, was, weak, and, for, this, reason, it, had, to, be, continually, strengthened, through, matrimonial, alliances, and, war, with, other, peoples, from, the, north, of, the, iberian, peninsula, after, pelayo, s, death, in, 737, his, son, favila, of, asturias, was, elected, king, favila, according, to, the, chronicles, was, killed, by, a, bear, during, a, trial, of, courage, pelayo, s, dynasty, in, asturias, survived, and, gradually, expanded, the, kingdom, s, boundaries, until, all, of, northwest, hispania, was, included, by, roughly, 775, however, credit, is, due, to, him, and, to, his, successors, the, banu, alfons, from, the, arab, chronicles, further, expansion, of, the, northwestern, kingdom, towards, the, south, occurred, during, the, reign, of, alfonso, ii, of, asturias, from, 791, to, 842, a, king, s, expedition, arrived, in, and, pillaged, lisbon, in, 798, probably, concerted, with, the, carolingians, the, asturian, kingdom, became, firmly, established, with, the, recognition, of, alfonso, ii, as, king, of, asturias, by, charlemagne, and, the, pope, during, his, reign, the, bones, of, st, james, the, great, were, declared, to, have, been, found, in, galicia, at, santiago, de, compostela, pilgrims, from, all, over, europe, opened, a, channel, of, communication, between, the, isolated, asturias, and, the, carolingian, lands, and, beyond, centuries, later, after, the, umayyad, conquest, of, the, iberian, heartland, of, the, visigothic, kingdom, the, muslims, crossed, the, pyrenees, and, gradually, took, control, of, septimania, starting, in, 719, with, the, conquest, of, narbonne, through, 725, when, carcassonne, and, n, mes, were, secured, from, the, stronghold, of, narbonne, they, tried, to, conquer, aquitaine, but, suffered, a, major, defeat, at, the, battle, of, toulouse, 721, ten, years, after, halting, their, advance, north, odo, of, aquitaine, married, his, daughter, to, uthman, ibn, naissa, a, rebel, berber, and, lord, of, cerdanya, perhaps, all, of, contemporary, catalonia, as, well, in, an, attempt, to, secure, his, southern, borders, to, fend, off, charles, martel, s, attacks, on, the, north, however, a, major, punitive, expedition, led, by, abdul, rahman, al, ghafiqi, the, latest, emir, of, al, andalus, defeated, and, killed, uthman, after, expelling, the, muslims, from, narbonne, in, 759, and, driving, their, forces, back, over, the, pyrenees, the, carolingian, king, pepin, the, short, conquered, aquitaine, in, a, ruthless, eight, year, war, charlemagne, followed, his, father, by, subduing, aquitaine, by, creating, counties, taking, the, church, as, his, ally, and, appointing, counts, of, frankish, or, burgundian, stock, like, his, loyal, william, of, gellone, making, toulouse, his, base, for, expeditions, against, al, andalus, charlemagne, decided, to, organize, a, regional, subkingdom, the, spanish, march, which, included, part, of, contemporary, catalonia, in, order, to, keep, the, aquitanians, in, check, and, to, secure, the, southern, border, of, the, carolingian, empire, against, muslim, incursions, in, 781, his, three, year, old, son, louis, was, crowned, king, of, aquitaine, under, the, supervision, of, charlemagne, s, trustee, william, of, gellone, and, was, nominally, in, charge, of, the, incipient, spanish, march, meanwhile, the, takeover, of, the, southern, fringes, of, al, andalus, by, abd, ar, rahman, i, in, 756, was, opposed, by, yusuf, ibn, abd, al, rahman, autonomous, governor, w, li, or, king, malik, of, al, andalus, abd, ar, rahman, i, expelled, yusuf, from, cordova, but, it, took, still, decades, for, him, to, expand, to, the, north, western, andalusian, districts, he, was, also, opposed, externally, by, the, abbasids, of, baghdad, who, failed, in, their, attempts, to, overthrow, him, in, 778, abd, al, rahman, closed, in, on, the, ebro, valley, regional, lords, saw, the, umayyad, emir, at, the, gates, and, decided, to, enlist, the, nearby, christian, franks, according, to, ali, ibn, al, athir, a, kurdish, historian, of, the, 12th, century, charlemagne, received, the, envoys, of, sulayman, al, arabi, husayn, and, abu, taur, at, the, diet, of, paderborn, in, 777, these, rulers, of, zaragoza, girona, barcelona, and, huesca, were, enemies, of, abd, ar, rahman, i, and, in, return, for, frankish, military, aid, against, him, offered, their, homage, and, allegiance, charlemagne, seeing, an, opportunity, agreed, upon, an, expedition, and, crossed, the, pyrenees, in, 778, near, the, city, of, zaragoza, charlemagne, received, the, homage, of, sulayman, al, arabi, however, the, city, under, the, leadership, of, husayn, closed, its, gates, and, refused, to, submit, unable, to, conquer, the, city, by, force, charlemagne, decided, to, retreat, on, the, way, home, the, rearguard, of, the, army, was, ambushed, and, destroyed, by, basque, forces, at, the, battle, of, roncevaux, pass, the, song, of, roland, a, highly, romanticised, account, of, this, battle, would, later, become, one, of, the, most, famous, chansons, de, geste, of, the, middle, ages, around, 788, abd, ar, rahman, i, died, and, was, succeeded, by, hisham, i, in, 792, hisham, proclaimed, a, jihad, advancing, in, 793, against, the, kingdom, of, asturias, and, carolingian, septimania, gothia, they,

callaghan, says, an, unknown, number, of, them, fled, and, took, refuge, in, asturias, or, septimania, in, asturias, they, supported, pelagius, s, uprising, and, joining, with, the, indigenous, leaders, formed, a, new, aristocracy, the, population, of, the, mountain, region, consisted, of, native, astures, galicians, cantabri, basques, and, other, groups, unassimilated, into, hispano, gothic, society, laying, the, foundations, for, the, kingdom, of, asturias, and, starting, the, astur, leonese, dynasty, that, spanned, from, 718, to, 1037, and, led, the, initial, efforts, in, the, iberian, peninsula, to, take, back, the, territories, then, ruled, by, the, moors, although, the, new, dynasty, first, ruled, in, the, mountains, of, asturias, with, the, capital, of, the, kingdom, established, initially, in, cangas, de, on, s, and, was, in, its, dawn, mostly, concerned, with, securing, the, territory, and, settling, the, monarchy, the, latest, kings, particularly, alfonso, iii, of, asturias, emphasised, the, nature, of, the, new, kingdom, as, heir, of, that, in, toledo, and, the, restoration, of, the, visigothic, nation, in, order, to, vindicate, the, expansion, to, the, south, however, such, claims, have, been, overall, dismissed, by, modern, historiography, emphasizing, the, distinct, autochthonous, nature, of, the, cantabro, asturian, and, vasconic, domains, with, no, continuation, to, the, gothic, kingdom, of, toledo, pelagius, s, kingdom, initially, was, little, more, than, a, gathering, point, for, the, existing, guerrilla, forces, during, the, first, decades, the, asturian, dominion, over, the, different, areas, of, the, kingdom, was, still, lax, and, for, this, reason, it, had, to, be, continually, strengthened, through, matrimonial, alliances, with, other, powerful, families, from, the, north, of, the, iberian, peninsula, thus, ermesinda, pelagius, s, daughter, was, married, to, alfonso, dux, peter, of, cantabria, s, son, alfonso, s, son, fruela, married, munia, a, basque, from, lava, after, crushing, a, basque, uprising, probably, resistance, their, son, is, reported, to, be, alfonso, ii, while, alfonso, i, s, daughter, adosinda, married, silo, a, local, chief, from, the, area, of, flavionavia, pravia, alfonso, s, military, strategy, was, typical, of, iberian, warfare, at, the, time, lacking, the, means, needed, for, wholesale, conquest, of, large, territories, his, tactics, consisted, of, raids, in, the, border, regions, of, vardulia, with, the, plunder, he, gained, further, military, forces, could, be, paid, enabling, him, to, raid, the, muslim, cities, of, lisbon, zamora, and, coimbra, alfonso, i, also, expanded, his, realm, westwards, conquering, galicia, during, the, reign, of, king, alfonso, ii, 791, 842, the, kingdom, was, firmly, established, and, a, series, of, muslim, raids, caused, the, transfer, of, the, asturian, capital, to, oviedo, the, king, is, believed, to, have, initiated, diplomatic, contacts, with, the, kings, of, pamplona, and, the, carolingians, thereby, gaining, official, recognition, for, his, kingdom, and, his, crown, from, the, pope, and, charlemagne, the, bones, of, st, james, the, great, were, proclaimed, to, have, been, found, in, iria, flavia, present, day, padr, n, in, 813, or, probably, two, or, three, decades, later, the, cult, of, the, saint, was, transferred, later, to, compostela, from, latin, campus, stellae, literally, the, star, field, possibly, in, the, early, 10th, century, when, the, focus, of, asturian, power, moved, from, the, mountains, over, to, leon, to, become, the, kingdom, of, le, n, or, galicia, leon, santiago, s, were, among, many, saint, relics, proclaimed, to, have, been, found, across, north, western, hispania, pilgrims, started, to, flow, in, from, other, iberian, christian, realms, sowing, the, seeds, of, the, later, way, of, saint, james, 11, 12th, century, that, sparked, the, enthusiasm, and, religious, zeal, of, continental, christian, europe, for, centuries, despite, numerous, battles, neither, the, umayyads, nor, the, asturians, had, sufficient, forces, to, secure, control, over, these, northern, territories, under, the, reign, of, ramiro, famed, for, the, highly, legendary, battle, of, clavijo, the, border, began, to, slowly, move, southward, and, asturian, holdings, in, castile, galicia, and, leon, were, fortified, and, an, intensive, program, of, re, population, of, the, countryside, began, in, those, territories, in, 924, the, kingdom, of, asturias, became, the, kingdom, of, le, n, when, leon, became, the, seat, of, the, royal, court, it, didn, t, bear, any, official, name, alfonso, iii, of, asturias, repopulated, the, strategically, important, city, leon, and, established, it, as, his, capital, king, alfonso, began, a, series, of, campaigns, to, establish, control, over, all, the, lands, north, of, the, douro, river, he, reorganised, his, territories, into, the, major, duchies, galicia, and, portugal, and, major, counties, salda, a, and, castile, and, fortified, the, borders, with, many, castles, at, his, death, in, 910, the, shift, in, regional, power, was, completed, as, the, kingdom, became, the, kingdom, of, le, n, from, this, power, base, his, heir, ordo, o, ii, was, able, to, organize, attacks, against, toledo, and, even, seville, the, caliphate, of, c, rdoba, was, gaining, power, and, began, to, attack, leon, king, ordo, o, allied, with, navarre, against, abd, al, rahman, but, they, were, defeated, in, valdejunquera, in, 920, for, the, next, 80, years, the, kingdom, of, le, n, suffered, civil, wars, moorish, attack, internal, intrigues, and, assassinations, and, the, partial, independence, of, galicia, and, castile, thus, delaying, the, reconquest, and, weakening, the, christian, forces, it, was, not, until, the, following, century, that, the, christians, started, to, see, their, conquests, as, part, of, a, long, term, effort, to, restore, the, unity, of, the, visigothic, kingdom, the, only, point, during, this, period, when, the, situation, became, hopeful, for, leon, was, the, reign, of, ramiro, ii, king, ramiro, in, alliance, with, fern, n, gonz, lez, of, castile, and, his, retinue, of, caballeros, villanos, defeated, the, caliph, in, simancas, in, 939, after, this, battle, when, the, caliph, barely, escaped, with, his, guard, and, the, rest, of, the, army, was, destroyed, king, ramiro, obtained, 12, years, of, peace, but, he, had, to, give, gonz, lez, the, independence, of, castile, as, payment, for, his, help, in, the, battle, after, this, defeat, moorish, attacks, abated, until, almanzor, began, his, campaigns, alfonso, v, finally, regained, control, over, his, domains, in, 1002, navarre, though, attacked, by, almanzor, remained, intact, the, conquest, of, leon, did, not, include, galicia, which, was, left, to, temporary, independence, after, the, withdrawal, of, the, leonese, king, galicia, was, conquered, soon, after, by, ferdinand, son, of, sancho, the, great, around, 1038, subsequent, kings, titled, themselves, kings, of, galicia, and, leon, instead, of, merely, king, of, leon, as, the, two, were, in, a, personal, union, at, the, end, of, the, 11th, century, king, afonso, vi, of, le, n, reached, the, tagus, 1085, repeating, the, same, policy, of, alliances, and, developing, collaboration, with, frankish, knights, the, original, repoblaci, n, was, then, complete, his, aim, was, to, create, a, hispanic, empire, like, the, visigothic, kingdom, 418, 720, to, reclaim, his, hegemony, over, the, entire, iberian, peninsula, within, this, context, the, territory, between, the, douro, and, the, tagus, was, repopulated, and, a, western, nucleus, was, formed, in, portugal, that, wanted, independence, this, marks, the, beginning, of, the, portuguese, repovoa, o, ou, repovoamento, occurred, during, the, reigns, of, the, house, of, burgundy, up, to, the, middle, of, the, thirteenth, century, when, the, portuguese, reconquista, was, also, brought, to, an, end, with, the, ultimate, conquering, of, gharb, al, andalus, when, in, march, 1249, the, city, of, faro, was, conquered, by, afonso, iii, of, portugal, ferdinand, i, of, leon, was, the, leading, king, of, the, mid, 11th, century, he, conquered, coimbra, and, attacked, the, taifa, kingdoms, often, demanding, the, tributes, known, as, parias, ferdinand, s, strategy, was, to, continue, to, demand, parias, until, the, taifa, was, greatly, weakened, both, militarily, and, financially, he, also, repopulated, the, borders, with, numerous, fueros, following, the, navarrese, tradition, on, his, death, in, 1064, he, divided, his, kingdom, between, his, sons, his, son, sancho, ii, of, castile, wanted, to, reunite, the, kingdom, of, his, father, and, attacked, his, brothers, with, a, young, noble, at, his, side, rodrigo, d, az, later, known, as, el, cid, campeador, sancho, was, killed, in, the, siege, of, zamora, by, the, traitor, bellido, dolfos, also, known, as, vellido, adolfo, in, 1072, his, brother, alfonso, vi, took, over, leon, castile, and, galicia, alfonso, vi, the, brave, gave, more, power, to, the, fueros, and, repopulated, segovia, vila, and, salamanca, once, he, had, secured, the, borders, king, alfonso, conquered, the, powerful, taifa, kingdom, of, toledo, in, 1085, toledo, which, was, the, former, capital, of, the, visigoths, was, a, very, important, landmark, and, the, conquest, made, alfonso, renowned, throughout, the, christian, world, however, this, conquest, was, conducted, rather, gradually, and, mostly, peacefully, during, the, course, of, several, decades, it, was, not, until, after, sporadic, and, consistent, population, resettlements, had, taken, place, that, toledo, was, decisively, conquered, alfonso, vi, was, first, and, foremost, a, tactful, monarch, who, chose, to, understand, the, kings, of, taifa, and, employed, unprecedented, diplomatic, measures, to, attain, political, feats, before, considering, the, use, of, force, he, adopted, the, title, imperator, totius, hispaniae, emperor, of, all, hispania, referring, to, all, the, christian, kingdoms, of, the, iberian, peninsula, and, not, just, the, modern, country, of, spain, alfonso, s, more, aggressive, policy, towards, the, taifas, worried, the, rulers, of, those, kingdoms, who, called, on, the, african, almoravids, for, help, the, kingdom, of, pamplona, primarily, extended, along, either, side, of, the, pyrenees, on, the, atlantic, ocean, the, kingdom, was, formed, when, local, leader, igo, arista, led, a, revolt, against, the, regional, frankish, authority, and, was, elected, or, declared, king, in, pamplona, traditionally, in, 824, establishing, a, kingdom, inextricably, linked, at, this, stage, to, their, kinsmen, the, muwallad, banu, qasi, of, tudela, although, relatively, weak, until, the, early, 11th, century, pamplona, took, a, more, active, role, after, the, accession, of, sancho, the, great, 1004, 1035, the, kingdom, expanded, greatly, under, his, reign, as, it, absorbed, castile, leon, and, what, was, to, be, aragon, in, addition, to, other, small, counties, that, would, unite, and, become, the, principality, of, catalonia, this, expansion, also, led, to, the, independence, of, galicia, as, well, as, gaining, overlordship, over, gascony, in, the, 12th, century, however, the, kingdom, contracted, to, its, core, and, in, 1162, king, sancho, vi, declared, himself, king, of, navarre, throughout, its, early, history, the, navarrese, kingdom, engaged, in, frequent, skirmishes, with, the, carolingian, empire, from, which, it, maintained, its, independence, a, key, feature, of, its, history, until, 1513, the, kingdom, of, aragon, started, off, as, an, offshoot, of, the, kingdom, of, navarre, it, was, formed, when, sancho, iii, of, navarre, decided, to, divide, his, large, realm, among, all, his, sons, aragon, was, the, portion, of, the, realm, which, passed, to, ramiro, i, of, aragon, an, illegitimate, son, of, sancho, iii, the, kingdoms, of, aragon, and, navarre, were, several, times, united, in, personal, union, until, the, death, of, alfonso, the, battler, in, 1135, in, 1137, the, heiress, of, the, kingdom, married, the, count, of, barcelona, and, their, son, alfonso, ii, ruled, from, 1162, the, combined, possessions, of, his, parents, resulting, in, the, composite, monarchy, that, modern, historians, call, the, crown, of, aragon, alfonso, successfully, reincorporated, the, principality, of, tarragona, into, their, realm, expelling, the, norman, d, aguil, family, in, the, following, centuries, the, crown, of, aragon, conquered, a, number, of, territories, in, the, iberian, peninsula, and, the, mediterranean, including, the, kingdom, of, valencia, and, the, kingdom, of, mallorca, james, i, of, aragon, also, known, as, james, the, conqueror, expanded, his, territories, to, the, north, south, and, east, james, also, signed, the, treaty, of, corbeil, 1258, in, which, the, french, king, renounced, to, any, feudal, claim, over, catalonia, early, in, his, reign, james, attempted, to, reunite, the, aragonese, and, navarrese, crowns, through, a, treaty, with, the, childless, sancho, vii, of, navarre, but, the, navarrese, nobles, rejected, him, and, chose, theobald, iv, of, champagne, in, his, stead, later, on, ferdinand, ii, of, aragon, married, isabella, of, castile, leading, to, a, dynastic, union, which, eventually, gave, birth, to, modern, spain, after, the, conquest, of, upper, navarre, navarre, south, of, the, pyrenees, and, the, emirate, of, granada, in, 1139, after, an, overwhelming, victory, in, the, battle, of, ourique, against, the, almoravids, afonso, henriques, was, proclaimed, the, first, king, of, portugal, by, his, troops, according, to, the, legend, christ, announced, from, heaven, afonso, s, great, deeds, whereby, he, would, establish, the, first, portuguese, cortes, at, lamego, and, be, crowned, by, the, primate, archbishop, of, braga, in, 1142, a, group, of, anglo, norman, crusaders, on, their, way, to, the, holy, land, helped, king, afonso, henriques, in, a, failed, siege, of, lisbon, 1142, in, the, treaty, of, zamora, in, 1143, alfonso, vii, of, leon, and, castile, recognized, portuguese, independence, from, the, kingdom, of, le, n, in, 1147, portugal, captured,

iii, recognized, afonso, henriques, as, king, of, portugal, in, 1179, with, portugal, finally, recognized, as, an, independent, kingdom, by, its, neighbors, afonso, henriques, and, his, successors, aided, by, crusaders, and, the, military, monastic, orders, the, knights, templar, the, order, of, aviz, or, the, order, of, saint, james, pushed, the, moors, to, the, algarve, on, the, southern, coast, of, portugal, after, several, campaigns, the, portuguese, part, in, the, reconquista, came, to, an, end, with, the, definitive, capture, of, the, algarve, in, 1249, with, all, of, portugal, now, under, the, control, of, afonso, iii, of, portugal, religious, cultural, and, ethnic, groups, became, gradually, homogenized, after, the, completion, of, the, reconquista, the, portuguese, territory, was, a, roman, catholic, realm, nonetheless, denis, of, portugal, carried, out, a, short, war, with, castile, for, possession, of, the, towns, of, serpa, and, moura, after, this, denis, avoided, war, in, 1297, he, signed, the, treaty, of, alcanizes, with, ferdinand, iv, of, castile, establishing, a, permanent, border, between, the, two, kingdoms, during, the, suppression, of, the,

for, the, templars, contribution, to, the, reconquista, and, the, reconstruction, of, portugal, after, the, wars, the, experience, gained, during, the, battles, of, the, reconquista, was, fundamental, to, conquest, of, ceuta, the, first, step, to, the, establishment, of, the, portuguese, empire, likewise, the, contact, with, muslim, s, navigation, techniques, and, sciences, enabled, the, creation, of, portuguese, nautical, innovations, such, as, the, caravel, the, principal, portuguese, ship, during, their, voyages, of, exploration, in, the, age, of, discovery, minor, christian, realms, were, the, kingdom, of, viguera, 970, 1005, the, lordship, of, albarrac, n, 1167, 1300, the, principality, of, tarragona, 1129, 1173, and, the, principality, of, valencia, 1094, 1102, during, the, 9th, century, the, berbers, returned, to, north, africa, in, the, aftermath, of, revolts, many, governors, of, large, cities, distant, from, the, capital, c, rdoba, had, planned, to, establish, their,

conquer, the, remaining, christian, kingdoms, of, the, iberian, peninsula, attacking, them, several, times, and, forcing, them, back, beyond, the, cantabrian, mountains, abd, ar, rahman, s, grandson, later, became, a, puppet, in, the, hands, of, the, great, vizier, almanzor, al, mansur, the, victorious, almanzor, waged, several, campaigns, attacking, and, sacking, burgos, leon, pamplona,

taifa, kingdoms, the, taifas, were, small, kingdoms, established, by, the, city, governors, the, result, was, many, up, to, 34, small, kingdoms, each, centered, upon, its, capital, their, governors, had, no, larger, scale, vision, of, the, moorish, presence, in, the, iberian, peninsula, and, had, no, qualms, about, attacking, their, neighbouring, kingdoms, whenever, they, could, gain, advantage, by, doing, so, the, split, into, the, taifa, states, weakened, the, islamic, presence, and, the, christian, kingdoms, further, advanced, as, alfonso, vi, of, leon, and, castile, conquered, toledo, in, 1085, surrounded, by, enemies, taifa, rulers, sent, a, desperate, appeal, to, the, berber, chieftain, yusuf, ibn, tashfin, leader, of, the, almoravids, taifas, reemerged, when, the, almoravid,

muslim, rulers, they, were, not, so, tolerant, towards, christians, and, jews, their, armies, entered, the, iberian, peninsula, on, several, occasions, 1086, 1088, 1093, and, defeated, king, alfonso, at, the, battle, of, sagrajas, in, 1086, but, initially, their, purpose, was, to, unite, all, the, taifas, into, a, single, almoravid, caliphate, their, actions, halted, the, southward, expansion, of, the, christian, kingdoms, their, only, defeat, came, at, valencia, in, 1094, due, to, the, actions, of, el, cid, meanwhile, navarre, lost, all, importance, under, king, sancho, iv, for, he, lost, rioja, to, sancho, ii, of, castile, and, nearly, became, the, vassal, of, aragon, at, his, death, the, navarrese, chose, as, their, king, sancho, ram, rez, king, of, aragon, who, thus, became, sancho,

as, well, as, from, internal, disputes, as, barcelona, suffered, a, dynastic, crisis, that, led, to, open, war, among, the, smaller, counties, but, by, the, 1080s, the, situation, had, calmed, down, and, the, dominion, of, barcelona, over, the, smaller, counties, was, restored, after, a, brief, period, of, disintegration, the, second, taifa, period, the, almohads, the, rising, power, in, north, africa, took, over, most, of, al, andalus, however, they, were, decisively, defeated, at, the, battle, of, las, navas, de, tolosa, 1212, by, a, christian, coalition, losing, almost, all, the, remaining, lands, of, al, andalus, in, the, following, decades, by, 1252, only, the, emirate, of, granada, remained, intact, but, as, a, vassal, state, of, castile, ferdinand, and, isabella, completed, the, reconquista, with, a, war, against, the, emirate, of, granada, that, started, in, 1482, and, ended, with, granada, s, surrender, on, 2, january, 1492, the, moors, in, castile,

suffered, between, 3, 000, and, 5, 000, killed, and, another, 5, 000, 6, 000, carried, off, as, slaves, soon, thereafter, however, they, faced, competition, from, the, rapidly, expanding, ottoman, empire, in, the, east, and, were, pushed, back, clashes, and, raids, on, bordering, andalusian, lands, did, not, keep, the, christian, kingdoms, from, battling, among, themselves, or, allying, with, muslim, kings, some, muslim, kings, had, christian, born, wives, or, mothers, some, christian, mercenaries, like, el, cid, were, contracted, by, taifa, kings, to, fight, against, their, neighbours, indeed, el, cid, s, first, battle, experience, was, gained, fighting, for, a, muslim, state, against, a, christian, state, at, the, battle, of, graus, in, 1063, he, and, other, castilians, fought, on,

released, his, subjects, from, their, responsibilities, to, the, king, declaring, that, the, men, of, his, realm, shall, be, absolved, from, their, fidelity, and, his, dominion, by, authority, of, the, apostolic, see, together, the, kings, of, portugal, castile, and, aragon, invaded, leon, in, the, face, of, this, onslaught, combined, with, pressure, from, the, pope, alfonso, ix, was, finally, forced, to, sue, for, peace, in, october, 1197, in, the, late, years, of, al, andalus, castile, had, the, might, to, conquer, the, remnants, of, the, kingdom, of, granada, but, the, kings, preferred, to, wait, and, claim, the, tribute, of, the, muslim, parias, the, trade, of, granadan, goods, and, the, parias, were, a, major, means, by, which, african, gold, entered, medieval, europe, similarly, there, was, frequent, muslim, infighting, throughout, the, existence, of, al, andalus, the, abbasid, revolution, 747, 750, divided, muslim, rulers, in, iberia, into, the, pro, abbasid, caliphate, faction, based, in, baghdad, and, the, pro, umayyad, faction, reconstituted, as, the, emirate, of, c, rdoba, charlemagne, s, failed, 778, campaign, into, iberia, was, prompted, by, the, invitation, of, the, pro, abbasid, governor, of, barcelona, sulayman, al, arabi, which, led, to, a, brief, abbasid, carolingian, alliance, against, the, umayyads, during, the, fitna, of, al, andalus, 1009, 1031, the, umayyad, run, caliphate, of, c, rdoba, fell, apart, into, rival, taifas, headed, by, islamic, emirs, warring, each, other, after, the, christian, king, of, castile, and, le, n, conquered, toledo, in, 1085, the, emirs, requested, yusuf, ibn, tashfin, leader, of, the, strict, islamic, almoravid, sect, to, come, to, their, defence, which, he, did, at, the, battle, of, sagrajas, 1086, however, yusuf, soon, turned, on, the, muslim, emirs, of, spain, defeating, them, all, and, conquering, their, lands, by, 1091, a, similar, scenario, occurred, in, 1147, 1157, when, the, almoravid, dynasty, fell, a, second, taifas, period, happened, and, the, muslim, controlled, cities, of, al, andalus, were, conquered, by, the, new, almohad, caliphate, the, war, of, the, granada, succession, 1482, 1492, took, place, after, the, deposition, of, emir, abu, l, hasan, ali, of, granada, by, his, son, muhammad, xii, of, granada, the, deposed, emir, s, brother, muhammad, xiii, of, granada, also, joined, the, fight, this, succession, conflict, took, place, simultaneously, with, the, granada, war, and, was, ended, only, by, the, castilian, conquest, in, 1492, the, reconquista, was, a, process, not, only, of, war, and, conquest, but, also, of, repopulation, christian, kings, moved, their, own, people, to, locations, abandoned, by, muslims, in, order, to, have, a, population, capable, of, defending, the, borders, the, main, repopulation, areas, were, the, douro, basin, the, northern, plateau, the, high, ebro, valley, la, rioja, and, central, catalonia, the, repopulation, of, the, douro, basin, took, place, in, two, distinct, phases, north, of, the, river, between, the, 9th, and, 10th, centuries, the, pressure, or, presura, system, was, employed, south, of, the, douro, in, the, 10th, and, 11th, centuries, the, presura, led, to, the, charters, forais, or, fueros, fueros, were, used, even, south, of, the, central, range, the, presura, referred, to, a, group, of, peasants, who, crossed, the, mountains, and, settled, in, the, abandoned, lands, of, the, douro, basin, asturian, laws, promoted, this, system, for, instance, granting, a, peasant, all, the, land, he, was, able, to, work, and, defend, as, his, own, property, of, course, asturian, and, galician, minor, nobles, and, clergymen, sent, their, own, expeditions, with, the, peasants, they, maintained, this, led, to, very, feudalised, areas, such, as, leon, and, portugal, whereas, castile, an, arid, land, with, vast, plains, and, harsh, climate, only, attracted, peasants, with, no, hope, in, biscay, as, a, consequence, castile, was, governed, by, a, single, count, but, had, a, largely, non, feudal, territory, with, many, free, peasants, presuras, also, appear, in, catalonia, when, the, count, of, barcelona, ordered, the, bishop, of, urgell, and, the, count, of, gerona, to, repopulate, the, plains, of, vic, during, the, 10th, century, and, onwards, cities, and, towns, gained, more, importance, and, power, as, commerce, reappeared, and, the, population, kept, growing, fueros, were, charters, documenting, the, privileges, and, usages, given, to, all, the, people, repopulating, a, town, the, fueros, provided, a, means, of, escape, from, the, feudal, system, as, fueros, were, only, granted, by, the, monarch, as, a, result, the, town, council, was, dependent, on, the, monarch, alone, and, in, turn, was, required, to, provide, auxilium, aid, or, troops, for, their, monarch, the, military, force, of, the, towns, became, the, caballeros, villanos, the, first, fuero, was, given, by, count, fern, n, gonz, lez, to, the, inhabitants, of, castrojeriz, in, the, 940, s, the, most, important, towns, of, medieval, hispania, had, fueros, or, forais, in, navarre, fueros, were, the, main, repopulating, system, later, on, in, the, 12th, century, aragon, also, employed, the, system, for, example, the, fuero, of, teruel, which, was, one, of, the, last, fueros, in, the, early, 13th, century, from, the, mid, 13th, century, on, no, more, charters, were, granted, as, the, demographic, pressure, had, disappeared, and, other, means, of, re, population, were, created, fueros, remained, as, city, charters, until, the, 18th, century, in, aragon, valencia, and, catalonia, and, until, the, 19th, century, in, castile, and, navarre, fueros, had, an, immense, importance, for, those, living, under, them, who, were, prepared, to, go, to, war, to, defend, their, rights, under, the, charter, in, the, 19th, century, the, abolition, of, the, fueros, in, navarre, would, be, one, of, the, causes, of, the, carlist, wars, in, castile, disputes, over, the, system, contributed, to, the, war, against, charles, i, castilian, war, of, the, communities, jim, bradbury, 2004, noted, that, the, christian, belligerents, in, the, reconquista, were, not, all, equally, motivated, by, religion, and, that, a, distinction, should, be, made, between, secular, rulers, on, the, one, hand, and, on, the, other, hand, christian, military, orders, which, came, from, elsewhere, including, the, three, main, orders, of, knights, templar, knights, hospitaller, and, teutonic, knights, or, were, established, inside, iberia, such, as, those, of, santiago, alc, ntara, and, calatrava, were, more, committed, to, religious, war, than, some, of, their, secular, counterparts, were, opposed, to, treating, with, muslims, and, carried, out, raids, and, even, atrocities, such, as, decapitating, muslim, prisoners, on, the, other, hand, christian, armies, sometimes, forged, temporary, alliances, with, islamic, emirs, and, christian, mercenaries, were, quite, willing, to, fight, for, arab, and, berber, rulers, if, the, price, was, right, el, cid, is, a, well, known, example, of, a, christian, mercenary, leader, who, was, in, paid, military, service, of, the, islamic, kings, of, zaragoza, for, years, mercenaries, were, an, important, factor, as, many, kings, did, not, have, enough, soldiers, available, norsemen, flemish, spearmen, frankish, knights, moorish, mounted, archers, archers, who, travelled, on, horseback, and, berber, light, cavalry, were, the, main, types, of, mercenaries, available, and, used, in, the, conflict, medieval, christian, armies, mainly, comprised, two, types, of, forces, the, cavalry, mostly, nobles, but, including, commoner, knights, from, the, 10th, century, on, and, the, infantry, or, peones, peasants, infantry, only, went, to, war, if, needed, which, was, not, frequent, in, an, atmosphere, of, constant, conflict, warfare, and, daily, life, were, strongly, intertwined, during, this, period, these, armies, reflected, the, need, for, society, to, be, on, constant, alert, during, the, first, chapters, of, the, reconquista, these, forces, were, capable, of, moving, long, distances, in, short, times, cavalry, tactics, in, hispania, involved, knights, approaching, the, enemy, throwing, javelins, then, withdrawing, to, a, safe, distance, before, commencing, another, assault, once, the, enemy, formation, was, sufficiently, weakened, the, knights, charged, with, thrusting, spears, lances, did, not, arrive, in, hispania, until, the, 11th, century, there, were, three, types, of, knights, caballeros, royal, knights, noble, knights, caballeros, hidalgos, and, commoner, knights, caballeros, villanos, or, mounted, soldier, from, a, villa, royal, knights, were, mainly, nobles, with, a, close, relationship, with, the, king, and, thus, claimed, a, direct, gothic, inheritance, royal, knights, in, the, early, stages, of, the, reconquista, were, equipped, with, mail, hauberk, kite, shield, a, long, sword, designed, to, fight, from, the, horse, javelins, spears, and, an, axe, noble, knights, came, from, the, ranks, of, the, infanzones, or, lower, nobles, whereas, the, commoner, knights, were, not, noble, but, were, wealthy, enough, to, afford, a, horse, uniquely, in, europe, these, horsemen, comprised, a, militia, cavalry, force, with, no, feudal, links, being, under, the, sole, control, of, the, king, or, the, count, of, castile, because, of, fueros, charters, with, the, crown, both, noble, and, common, knights, wore, padded, armour, and, carried, javelins, spears, and, round, tasselled, shield, influenced, by, moorish, shields, as, well, as, a, sword, the, peones, were, peasants, who, went, to, battle, in, service, of, their, feudal, lord, poorly, equipped, with, bows, and, arrows, spears, and, short, swords, they, were, mainly, used, as, auxiliary, troops, their, function, in, battle, was, to, contain, the, enemy, troops, until, the, cavalry, arrived, and, to, block, the, enemy, infantry, from, charging, the, knights, the, longbow, the, composite, bow, and, the, crossbow, were, the, basic, types, of, bows, and, were, especially, popular, in, the, infantry, in, the, early, middle, ages, in, hispania, armour, was, typically, made, of, leather, with, iron, scales, head, protections, consisted, of, a, round, helmet, with, nose, protector, influenced, by, the, designs, used, by, vikings, who, attacked, during, the, 8th, and, 9th, centuries, and, a, chain, mail, headpiece, shields, were, often, round, or, kidney, shaped, except, for, the, kite, shaped, designs, used, by, the, royal, knights, usually, adorned, with, geometric, designs, crosses, or, tassels, shields, were, made, out, of, wood, and, had, a, leather, cover, steel, swords, were, the, most, common, weapon, the, cavalry, used, long, double, edged, swords, and, the, infantry, short, single, edged, ones, guards, were, either, semicircular, or, straight, but, always, highly, ornamented, with, geometrical, patterns, spears, and, javelins, were, up, to, 1, 5, metres, long, and, had, an, iron, tip, the, double, axe, made, of, iron, 30, cm, long, and, possessing, an, extremely, sharp, edge, was, designed, to, be, equally, useful, as, a, thrown, weapon, or, in, close, combat, maces, and, hammers, were, not, common, but, some, specimens, have, remained, and, are, thought, to, have, been, used, by, members, of, the, cavalry, this, style, of, warfare, remained, dominant, in, the, iberian, peninsula, until, the, late, 11th, century, when, lance, tactics, entered, from, france, although, the, traditional, horse, javelin, shot, techniques, continued, to, be, used, in, the, 12th, and, 13th, centuries, soldiers, typically, carried, a, sword, a, lance, a, javelin, and, either, bow, and, arrows, or, crossbow, and, darts, bolts, armor, consisted, of, a, coat, of, mail, over, a, quilted, jacket,

covered, with, leather, and, protected, by, an, iron, band, the, shields, of, knights, and, nobles, would, bear, the, family, s, coat, of, arms, knights, rode, in, both, the, muslim, style, a, la, jineta, i, e, the, equivalent, of, a, modern, jockey, s, seat, a, short, stirrup, strap, and, bended, knees, allowed, for, better, control, and, speed, or, in, the, french, style, a, la, brida, a, long, stirrup, strap, allowed, for, more, security, in, the, saddle, i, e, the, equivalent, of, the, modern, cavalry, seat, which, is, more, secure, when, acting, as, heavy, cavalry, horses, were, occasionally, fitted, with, a, coat, of, mail, as, well, around, the, 14th, and, 15th, centuries, heavy, cavalry, gained, a, predominant, role, including, knights, wearing, full, plate, armor, the, new, christian, hierarchy, demanded, heavy, taxes, from, non, christians, and, gave, them, rights, such, as, in, the, treaty, of, granada, 1491, only, for, moors, in, recently, islamic, granada, on, 30, july, 1492, all, the, jewish, community, some, 200, 000, people, were, forcibly, expelled, the, next, year, the, alhambra, decree, ordered, the, expulsion, of, practicing, jews, leading, many, of, them, to, convert, to, catholicism, in, 1502, queen, isabella, i, declared, that, conversion, to, catholicism, was, compulsory, within, the, kingdom, of, castile, holy, roman, emperor, charles, v, imposed, the, same, religious, requirement, on, moors, in, the, kingdom, of, aragon, in, 1526, forcing, its, muslim, population, to, convert, during, the, revolt, of, the, germanies, making, things, more, complex, were, the, many, former, muslims, and, jews, known, as, moriscos, marranos, and, conversos, who, shared, ancestors, in, common, with, many, christians, especially, among, the, aristocracy, causing, much, concern, over, loyalty, and, attempts, by, the, aristocracy, to, hide, their, non, christian, ancestry, some, the, numbers, are, debated, continued, to, secretly, practice, their, religions, and, use, their, languages, well, into, the, sixteenth, century, those, that, the, spanish, inquisition, found, to, be, secretly, practicing, islam, or, judaism, were, executed, imprisoned, or, exiled, nevertheless, all, those, deemed, to, be, new, christians, were, repeatedly, suspected, of, illegally, continuing, in, secret, to, practice, their, religions, various, crimes, against, the, spanish, state, including, continued, practice, of, islam, or, judaism, new, christians, were, subject, to, many, discriminatory, practices, starting, in, the, sixteenth, century, the, many, advances, and, retreats, created, several, social, types, since, the, 19th, century, traditional, western, and, especially, iberian, historiography, has, stressed, the, existence, of, the, reconquista, a, continual, phenomenon, by, which, the, christian, iberian, kingdoms, opposed, and, conquered, the, muslim, kingdoms, understood, as, a, common, enemy, who, had, militarily, seized, territory, from, native, iberian, christians, however, modern, scholarship, has, challenged, this, concept, of, a, reconquista, as, a, national, myth, tied, to, spanish, nationalism, the, concept, has, served, the, idea, that, spain, is, a, nation, shaped, against, islam, contributing, to, a, largely, biased, and, distorted, vision, of, the, iberian, medieval, past, aimed, at, delegitimizing, the, islamic, presence, al, andalus, and, therefore, at, legitimizing, the, christian, conquest, of, the, muslim, territory, among, other, arguments, one, of, those, advanced, by, scholars, is, that, no, military, campaign, lasts, eight, centuries, the, term, reconquista, in, this, sense, first, appeared, in, the, 19th, century, and, only, entered, the, dictionary, of, the, royal, spanish, academy, in, 1936, with, the, rise, of, francisco, franco, the, concept, of, the, reconquista, continues, to, have, significance, and, has, even, experienced, a, resurgence, in, modern, politics, especially, for, the, extreme, right, spanish, party, vox, but, also, more, broadly, among, xenophobic, and, especially, islamophobic, conservatives, in, the, west, with, the, influence, of, the, doctrine, of, a, clash, of, civilizations, real, legendary, and, fictional, episodes, from, the, reconquista, are, the, subject, of, much, of, medieval, galician, portuguese, spanish, and, catalan, literature, such, as, the, cantar, de, gesta, some, noble, genealogies, show, the, close, though, not, numerous, relations, between, muslims, and, christians, for, example, al, mansur, ibn, abi, aamir, whose, rule, is, considered, to, have, marked, the, peak, of, power, for, moorish, al, andalus, hispania, married, abda, daughter, of, sancho, garc, s, ii, of, navarra, who, bore, him, a, son, named, abd, al, rahman, and, commonly, known, in, a, pejorative, sense, as, sanchuelo, little, sancho, in, arabic, shanjoul, after, his, father, s, death, sanchuelo, abd, al, rahman, as, a, son, of, a, christian, princess, was, a, strong, contender, to, take, over, the, ultimate, power, in, muslim, al, andalus, a, hundred, years, later, king, alfonso, vi, of, castile, regarded, as, one, of, the, greatest, medieval, spanish, kings, designated, his, son, also, named, sancho, by, the, muslim, princess, refugee, zaida, of, seville, as, his, heir, the, reconquista, was, a, war, with, long, periods, of, respite, between, the, adversaries, partly, for, pragmatic, reasons, and, also, due, to, infighting, among, the, christian, kingdoms, of, the, north, spanning, over, seven, centuries, some, populations, practiced, islam, or, christianity, as, their, own, religion, during, these, centuries, so, the, identity, of, contenders, changed, over, time, it, is, noteworthy, that, the, popular, hero, el, cid, whose, name, is, very, much, associated, with, the, reconquista, had, at, one, part, of, his, career, actually, fought, for, the, muslim, rulers, of, zaragoza, whom, he, defended, from, its, traditional, enemy, the, christian, aragon, the, most, important, achievement, of, el, cid, s, career, the, conquest, of, the, kingdom, city, of, valencia, was, actually, achieved, in, close, alliance, with, the, banu, hud, and, other, muslim, dynasties, opposed, to, the, almoravids, in, 1558, the, armies, of, king, henry, ii, of, france, managed, to, conquer, the, city, of, calais, which, had, been, under, english, rule, for, centuries, queen, mary, i, of, england, considered, the, loss, of, calais, as, the, greatest, disaster, of, her, reign, the, region, around, calais, then, known, as, the, calaisis, was, renamed, the, pays, reconquis, reconquered, country, in, commemoration, of, its, recovery, by, the, french, the, french, were, certainly, aware, of, the, spanish, reconquista, and, since, at, the, time, philip, ii, of, spain, was, queen, mary, s, consort, use, of, this, term, might, have, been, intended, as, a, deliberate, snub, to, him, currently, festivals, called, moros, y, cristianos, spanish, moros, i, cristians, catalan, mouros, e, crist, os, portuguese, and, mouros, e, cristi, ns, galician, which, all, mean, moors, and, christians, recreate, the, fights, as, colorful, parades, with, elaborate, garments, and, many, fireworks, especially, on, the, central, and, southern, towns, of, the, land, of, valencia, like, alcoi, ontinyent, or, villena, a, 2016, study, found, that, the, rate, of, reconquest, how, rapidly, the, christian, frontier, was, expanded, has, persistent, effects, on, the, spanish, economy, to, this, day, after, an, initial, phase, of, military, conquest, christians, states, incorporated, the, conquered, land, when, large, frontier, regions, were, incorporated, at, once, the, land, was, mostly, given, to, the, nobility, and, the, military, orders, with, negative, effects, on, long, term, development, the, incorporation, of, small, regions, on, the, other, hand, generally, allowed, for, the, participation, of, individual, settlers, and, was, more, likely, to, fall, under, the, auspices, of, the, crown, this, led, to, a, more, equitable, distribution, of, land, and, greater, social, equality, with, positive, effects, on, long, term, development, as, the, christian, kingdoms, completed, their, conquest, of, territory, on, the, iberian, peninsula, they, shifted, their, impetus, elsewhere, even, to, the, maghreb, which, is, located, across, the, strait, of, gibraltar, a, castilian, crown, sanctioned, punitive, expedition, against, tetouan, a, corsair, stronghold, was, launched, as, early, as, 1399, 1400, the, conquest, of, ceuta, in, 1415, marked, the, beginning, of, portuguese, expansion, in, africa, thereby, it, allowed, portugal, to, exert, control, over, castilian, and, aragonese, trade, through, the, strait, and, it, also, allowed, portugal, to, establish, a, powerbase, for, the, launching, of, raid, expeditions, in, muslim, ruled, lands, some, 15th, century, political, writers, promoted, the, idea, of, a, gothic, monarchy, an, heir, to, rome, that, included, territory, across, the, strait, the, african, enterprise, which, was, undertaken, during, the, rule, of, the, catholic, monarchs, was, nominally, endorsed, by, papal, bulls, and, it, was, also, financed, with, donations, which, were, used, to, pay, the, crusade, tax, even, if, it, was, viewed, with, some, suspicion, by, the, papacy, conquest, efforts, in, africa, on, the, part, of, the, catholic, monarchy, by, and, large, stalled, following, the, death, of, ferdinand, ii, of, aragon, the, model, of, conquest, and, repopulation, by, christian, powers, in, the, peninsula, was, however, never, reproduced, in, northern, africa, and, with, the, conquered, territory, a, fortified, mark, with, very, few, fortresses, scattered, along, an, extensive, coastline, merely, adopting, a, defensive, role, it, allowed, for, ottoman, expansion, in, the, region, the, portuguese, warred, with, the, ottoman, caliphate, in, the, mediterranean, indian, ocean, and, southeast, asia, as, the, portuguese, conquered, the, ottomans, allies, the, sultanate, of, adal, in, east, africa,

views, of, the, new, world, and, the, christian, convictions, that, shaped, his, actions, there, were, influenced, by, historical, european, anti, muslim, ideas, that, had, underpinned, the, reconquista, itself, he, believed, that, by, his, voyaging, he, would, be, able, to, reach, the, grand, khan, of, asia, and, create, a, coalition, that, could, attack, the, middle, east, from, both, sides, and, thus, bring, jerusalem, back, under, christian, rule, along, with, the, rhetoric, of, the, crusades, the, rhetoric, of, the, reconquista, serves, as, a, rallying, point, in, the, political, discourse, of, the, contemporary, far, right, in, spain, portugal, and, more, broadly, it, also, serves, as, a, rallying, point, in, the, political, discourse, of, the, far, right, in,

boabdil, in, granada, on, 2, january, acquired, a, markedly, nationalistic, undertone, during, the, early, years, of, the, francoist, regime, and, since, the, death, of, the, dictator, francisco, franco, in, 1975, it, has, served, as, glue, for, extreme, right, groups, by, facilitating, their, open, air, physical, gatherings, and, providing, them, with, an, occasion, which, they, can, use, to, explicitly, state, their, political, demands, a, spanish, legion, unit, usually, parades, and, sings, el, novio, de, la, muerte, boyfriend, of, death, the, far, right, has, also, waged, a, culture,
