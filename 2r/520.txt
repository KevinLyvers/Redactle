movements, supporting, independence, from, dutch, colonialism, such, as, budi, utomo, the, indonesian, national, party, pni, sarekat, islam, and, the, indonesian, communist, party, pki, grew, rapidly, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, budi, utomo, sarekat, islam, and, others, pursued, strategies, of, co, operation, by, joining, the, dutch, initiated, volksraad, people, s, council, in, the, hope, that, indonesia, would, be, granted, self, rule, others, chose, a, non, cooperative, strategy, demanding, the, freedom, of, self, government, from, the, dutch, east, indies, colony, the, most, notable, of, these, leaders, were, sukarno, and, mohammad, hatta, two, students, and, nationalist, leaders, who, had, benefited, from, the, educational, reforms, of, the, dutch, ethical, policy, the, occupation, of, indonesia, by, japan, for, three, and, a, half, years, during, world, war, ii, was, a, crucial, factor, in, the, subsequent, revolution, the, netherlands, had, minimal, ability, to, defend, its, colony, against, the, japanese, army, and, within, only, three, months, of, their, initial, attacks, the, japanese, had, occupied, the, dutch, east, indies, in, java, and, to, a, lesser, extent, in, sumatra, indonesia, s, two, dominant, islands, the, japanese, spread, and, encouraged, nationalist, sentiment, although, this, was, done, more, for, japanese, political, advantage, than, from, altruistic, support, of, indonesian, independence, this, support, created, new, indonesian, institutions, including, local, neighbourhood, organisations, and, elevated, political, leaders, such, as, sukarno, just, as, significantly, for, the, subsequent, revolution, the, japanese, destroyed, and, replaced, much, of, the, dutch, created, economic, administrative, and, political, infrastructure, on, 7, september, 1944, with, the, war, going, badly, for, the, japanese, prime, minister, koiso, promised, independence, for, indonesia, but, no, date, was, set, for, supporters, of,

indonesians, came, to, regard, themselves, as, pro, republican, and, a, mood, of, revolution, swept, across, the, country, external, power, had, shifted, it, would, be, weeks, before, allied, forces, shipping, entered, indonesia, owing, in, part, to, boycotts, and, strikes, in, australia, on, coaling, loading, and, manning, dutch, shipping, from, australia, where, the, netherlands, east, indies,

down, their, arms, and, maintain, order, a, contradiction, that, some, resolved, by, handing, weapons, to, japanese, trained, indonesians, the, resulting, power, vacuums, in, java, and, sumatra, in, the, weeks, following, the, japanese, surrender, created, an, atmosphere, of, uncertainty, but, also, one, of, opportunity, for, the, republicans, many, pemuda, joined, pro, republic, struggle,

armed, forces, groups, many, groups, were, undisciplined, due, to, both, the, circumstances, of, their, formation, and, what, they, perceived, as, revolutionary, spirit, in, the, first, weeks, japanese, troops, often, withdrew, from, urban, areas, to, avoid, confrontations, by, september, 1945, control, of, major, infrastructure, installations, including, railway, stations, and, trams, in,

common, in, jakarta, yogyakarta, and, surakarta, which, fostered, a, generation, of, writers, known, as, angkatan, 45, generation, of, 45, many, of, whom, believed, their, work, could, be, part, of, the, revolution, republican, leaders, struggled, to, come, to, terms, with, popular, sentiment, some, wanted, passionate, armed, struggle, others, a, more, reasoned, approach, some, leaders, such, as, the, leftist, tan, malaka, spread, the, idea, that, this, was, a, revolutionary, struggle, to, be, led, and, won, by, the, indonesian, pemuda, sukarno, and, hatta, by, contrast, were, more, interested, in, planning, government, and, institutions, to, achieve, independence, through, diplomacy, pro, revolution, demonstrations, took, place, in, large, cities, including, one, in, jakarta, on, 19, september, with, over, 200, 000, people, which, sukarno, and, hatta, fearing, violence, successfully, quelled, by, september, 1945, many, of, the, self, proclaimed, pemuda, who, were, ready, to, die, for, 100, freedom, were, getting, impatient, it, was, common, for, ethnic, out, groups, dutch, internees, eurasian, ambonese, and, chinese, and, anyone, considered, to, be, a, spy, to, be, subjected, to, intimidation, kidnapping, robbery, murder, and, organised, massacres, such, attacks, would, continue, throughout, the, course, of, the, revolution, but, were, most, present, during, the, 1945, 46, period, which, is, known, as, the, bersiap, estimates, of, the, death, toll, of, the, bersiap, period, vary, from, 3, 500, to, 30, 000, niod, concluded, a, dutch, casualty, number, of, approximately, 5, 500, with, possible, higher, numbers, but, not, above, 10, 000, estimates, of, the, number, of, indonesian, fighters, killed, in, the, lead, up, to, and, during, the, battle, of,

similar, number, missing, in, action, the, actual, dutch, military, was, hardly, involved, as, it, started, to, return, to, indonesia, only, in, march, and, april, 1946, by, the, end, of, august, 1945, a, central, republican, government, had, been, established, in, jakarta, it, adopted, a, constitution, drafted, during, the, japanese, occupation, by, the, preparatory, committee, for, indonesian, independence, with, general, elections, yet, to, be, held, a, central, indonesian, national, committee, knip, was, appointed, to, assist, the, president, similar, committees, were, established, at, provincial, and, regency, levels, questions, of, allegiance, immediately, arose, amongst, indigenous, rulers, central, javanese, principalities, for, example, immediately, declared, themselves, republican, while, many, raja, rulers, of, the, outer, islands, who, had, been, enriched, from, their, support, of, the, dutch, were, less, enthusiastic, such, reluctance, among, many, outer, islands, was, sharpened, by, the, radical, non, aristocratic, and, sometimes, islamic, nature, of, the, java, centric, republican, leadership, support, did, however, come, from, south, sulawesi, including, the, king, of, bone, who, still, recalled, battles, against, the, dutch, from, early, in, the, century, and, from, makassarese, and, bugis, raja, who, supported, the, republican, governor, of, jakarta, a, menadonese, christian, many, balinese, raja, accepted, republican, authority, fearing, the, dutch, would, attempt, to, re, establish, their, authority, over, indonesia, the, new, republican, government, and, its, leaders, moved, quickly, to, strengthen, the, fledgling, administration, within, indonesia, the, newly, formed, government, although, enthusiastic, was, fragile, and, focused, in, java, where, focused, at, all, it, was, rarely, and, loosely, in, contact, with, the, outer, islands, which, had, more, japanese, troops, particularly, in, japanese, naval, areas, less, sympathetic, japanese, commanders, and, fewer, republican, leaders, and, activists, in, november, 1945, a, parliamentary, form, of, government, was, established, and, sjahrir, was, appointed, prime, minister, in, the, week, following, the, japanese, surrender, the, giy, gun, peta, and, heiho, groups, were, disbanded, by, the, japanese, command, structures, and, membership, vital, for, a, national, army, were, consequently, dismantled, thus, rather, than, being, formed, from, a, trained, armed, and, organised, army, the, republican, armed, forces, began, to, grow, in, september, from, usually, younger, less, trained, groups, built, around, charismatic, leaders, creating, a, rational, military, structure, that, was, obedient, to, central, authority, from, such, disorganisation, was, one, of, the, major, problems, of, the, revolution, a, problem, that, remains, through, to, contemporary, times, in, the, self, created, indonesian, army, japanese, trained, indonesian, officers,

east, indies, administration, had, just, received, a, ten, million, dollar, loan, from, the, united, states, to, finance, its, return, to, indonesia, the, netherlands, however, was, critically, weakened, from, world, war, ii, in, europe, and, did, not, return, as, a, significant, military, force, until, early, 1946, the, japanese, and, members, of, the, allied, forces, reluctantly, agreed, to, act, as, caretakers, australian, forces, of, i, corps, under, general, leslie, morshead, had, landed, in, borneo, in, may, 1945, to, destroy, the, imperial, japanese, forces, stationed, there, as,

republican, positions, however, were, still, intact, behind, the, dutch, lines, some, republican, militias, particularly, laborers, peasants, and, student, troops, just, couldn, t, leave, thus, must, live, and, operate, behind, renville, line, the, agreement, also, required, referendums, to, be, held, on, the, political, future, of, the, dutch, held, areas, the, apparent, reasonableness, of, republicans, garnered, much, important, american, goodwill, indonesian, republic, faced, economic, hardship, due, to, continued, naval, blockade, and, land, blockades, at, renville, line, in, violation, of, renville, agreement, which, affect, sufficient, avalailability, of, not, only, arms, but, also, food, clothing, medicines, including, bandages, mails, books, magazines, material, to, service, and, repair, transportation, and, overpopulation, because, of, people, fleeing, from, dutch, advances, in, operation, product, this, economic, hardship, paired, with, political, crisis, by, accepting, terms, of, renville, agrement, and, factional, conflicts, due, to, conflicting, ideologies, of, indonesian, nationalists, fed, fuel, to, one, of, internal, turmoils, which, later, into, madiun, affair, diplomatic, efforts, between, the, netherlands, and, the, republic, continued, throughout, 1948, and, 1949, political, pressures, both, domestic, and, international, hindered, dutch, attempts, to, decide, upon, objectives, similarly, republican, leaders, faced, great, difficulty, in, persuading, their, people, to, accept, diplomatic, concessions, by, july, 1948, negotiations, were, in, deadlock, and, the, netherlands, pushed, unilaterally, towards, van, mook, s, federal, indonesia, concept, the, new, federal, states, of, south, sumatra, and, east, java, were, created, although, neither, had, a, viable, support, base, the, netherlands, set, up, the, bijeenkomst, voor, federaal, overleg, bfo, or, federal, consultative, assembly, a, body, comprising, the, leadership, of, the, federal, states, and, charged, with, the, formation, of, a, united, states, of, indonesia, and, an, interim, government, by, the, end, of, 1948, the, dutch, plans, however, had, no, place, for, the, republic, unless, it, accepted, a, minor, role, already, defined, for, it, later, plans, included, java, and, sumatra, but, dropped, all, mention, of, the, republic, the, main, sticking, point, in, the, negotiations, was, the, balance, of, power, between, the, netherlands, high, representative, successor, to, office, of, governor, general, and, the, republican, forces, mutual, distrust, between, the, netherlands, and, the, republic, hindered, negotiations, indonesia, who, faced, aforementioned, naval, and, land, blockades, which, violated, renville, agreement, also, feared, a, second, major, dutch, offensive, meanwhile, the, dutch, objected, to, continued, pro, republican, activity, on, the, dutch, side, of, the, renville, line, in, february, 1948, the, siliwangi, battalion, of, the, republican, army, led, by, nasution, marched, from, west, java, to, central, java, the, relocation, was, intended, to, ease, internal, republican, tensions, involving, the, battalion, in, the, surakarta, area, the, battalion, however, clashed, with, dutch, troops, while, crossing, mount, slamet, and, the, dutch, believed, it, was, part, of, a, systematic, troop, movement, across, the, renville, line, the, fear, of, such, incursions, actually, succeeding, along, with, apparent, republican, undermining, of, the, dutch, established, pasundan, state, and, negative, reports, led, to, the, dutch, leadership, increasingly, seeing, itself, as, losing, control, we, have, been, attacked, the, dutch, government, have, betrayed, the, cease, fire, agreement, all, the, armed, forces, will, carry, out, the, plans, which, have, been, decided, on, to, confront, the, dutch, attack, general, sudirman, broadcast, from, his, sickbed, frustrated, at, negotiations, with, the, republic, and, believing, it, weakened, by, both, the, darul, islam, and, madiun, insurgencies, the, dutch, launched, a, military, offensive, on, 19, december, 1948, which, it, termed, operatie, kraai, operation, crow, by, the, following, day, it, had, conquered, the, city, of, yogyakarta, the, location, of, the, temporary, republican, capital, by, the, end, of, december, all, major, republican, held, cities, in, java, and, sumatra, were, in, dutch, hands, the, republican, president, vice, president, and, all, but, six, republic, of, indonesia, ministers, were, captured, by, dutch, troops, and, exiled, on, bangka, island, off, the, east, coast, of, sumatra, in, areas, surrounding, yogyakarta, and, surakarta, republican, forces, refused, to, surrender, and, continued, to, wage, a, guerrilla, war, under, the, leadership, of, republican, military, chief, of, staff, general, sudirman, who, had, escaped, the, dutch, offensives, an, emergency, republican, government, the, pemerintahan, darurat, republik, indonesia, pdri, was, established, in, west, sumatra, although, dutch, forces, conquered, the, towns, and, cities, in, republican, heartlands, on, java, and, sumatra, they, could, not, control, villages, and, the, countryside, republican, troops, and, militia, led, by, lt, colonel, later, president, suharto, attacked, dutch, positions, in, yogyakarta, at, dawn, on, 1, march, 1949, the, dutch, were, expelled, from, the, city, for, six, hours, but, reinforcements, were, brought, in, from, the, nearby, cities, of, ambarawa, and, semarang, that, afternoon, indonesian, fighters, retreated, at, 12, 00, pm, and, the, dutch, re, entered, the, city, the, indonesian, attack, later, known, in, indonesia, as, serangan, oemoem, new, spelling, serangan, umum, 1, march, general, offensive, is, commemorated, by, a, large, monument, in, yogyakarta, a, large, scale, attack, against, dutch, troops, in, surakarta, on, 10, august, the, same, year, resulted, in, republican, forces, holding, the, city, for, two, days, once, again, international, opinion, of, the, dutch, military, campaigns, was, one, of, outrage, significantly, in, both, the, united, nations, and, the, united, states, u, s, secretary, of, state, george, c, marshall, threatened, to, stop, all, of, the, economic, aid, program, to, the, netherlands, unless, they, immediately, withdraw, from, indonesia, and, transferred, all, of, the, sovereignty, to, indonesia, in, january, 1949, the, united, nations, security, council, passed, a, resolution, demanding, the, reinstatement, of, the, republican, government, united, states, aid, specifically, earmarked, for, dutch, indonesia, was, immediately, cancelled, and, pressure, mounted, within, the, us, congress, for, all, united, states, aid, to, be, cut, off, this, included, marshall, plan, funds, vital, for, dutch, post, world, war, ii, rebuilding, that, had, so, far, totalled, us, 1, billion, the, netherlands, government, had, spent, an, amount, equivalent, to, almost, half, of, this, funding, their, campaigns, in, indonesia, that, united, states, aid, could, be, used, to, fund, a, senile, and, ineffectual, imperialism, encouraged, many, key, voices, in, the, united, states, including, those, amongst, the, us, republican, party, and, from, within, american, churches, and, ngos, to, speak, out, in, support, of, indonesian, independence, the, internal, turmoil, happened, was, called, as, social, revolutions, and, insurgencies, of, communist, and, islamist, it, is, argued, there, were, common, causes, because, of, general, similarity, of, these, separated, actions, the, common, causes, are, extreme, polarization, of, pergerakan, and, aristocrat, groups, the, harshness, of, japanese, requirement, for, labour, and, rice, the, vacuum, of, central, authority, powerful, islamic, sentiment, for, mass, mobilization, and, activity, of, minute, semi, underground, revolutionary, cadres, commonly, communist, the, so, called, social, revolutions, following, the, independence, proclamation, were, challenges, to, the, dutch, established, indonesian, social, order, and, to, some, extent, a, result, of, the, resentment, against, japanese, imposed, policies, across, the, country, people, rose, up, against, traditional, aristocrats, and, village, heads, and, attempted, to, exert, popular, ownership, of, land, and, other, resources, the, majority, of, the, social, revolutions, ended, quickly, in, most, cases, the, challenges, to, the, social, order, were, quashed, although, in, east, sumatra, the, sultanates, were, overthrown, and, there, were, mass, killings, of, members, of, the, aristocratic, families, a, culture, of, violence, rooted, in, the, deep, conflicts, that, split, the, countryside, during, the, revolution, would, repeatedly, erupt, throughout, the, whole, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, the, term, social, revolution, has, been, applied, to, a, range, of, mostly, violent, activities, of, the, left, that, included, both, altruistic, attempts, to, organise, real, revolution, and, simple, expressions, of, revenge, resentment, and, assertions, of, power, violence, was, one, of, the, many, lessons, learned, during, the, japanese, occupation, and, figures, identified, as, feudal, including, kings, regents, or, simply, the, wealthy, were, often, attacked, and, sometimes, beheaded, rape, became, a, weapon, against, feudal, women, in, the, coastal, sultanates, of, sumatra, and, kalimantan, for, example, sultans, and, others, whose, authority, had, been, shored, up, by, the, dutch, were, attacked, as, soon, as, japanese, authority, left, the, pro, dutch, aristocratic, administrators, ule, balangs, secular, local, lords, of, aceh, who, had, been, the, foundation, of, dutch, rule, were, executed, during, local, civil, war, and, its, place, was, taken, over, by, pro, republican, religious, leaders, ulama, meanwhile, monarchical, officials, in, surakarta, was, kidnapped, by, anti, monarchist, movement, which, led, to, the, freezing, and, abolition, of, the, special, region, many, indonesians, lived, in, fear, and, uncertainty, particularly, a, significant, proportion, of, the, population, who, supported, the, dutch, or, who, remained, under, dutch, control, the, popular, revolutionary, cry, freedom, or, death, was, often, interpreted, to, justify, killings, under, claimed, republican, authority, traders, were, often, in, particularly, difficult, positions, on, the, one, hand, they, were, pressured, by, republicans, to, boycott, all, sales, to, the, dutch, on, the, other, hand, dutch, police, could, be, merciless, in, their, efforts, to, stamp, out, smugglers, on, which, the, republican, economy, depended, in, some, areas, the, term, kedaulatan, rakyat, exercising, the, sovereignty, of, the, people, which, is, mentioned, in, the, preamble, of, the, constitution, and, used, by, pemuda, to, demand, pro, active, policies, from, leaders, came, to, be, used, not, only, in, the, demanding, of, free, goods, but, also, to, justify, extortion, and, robbery, chinese, merchants, in, particular, were, often, forced, to, keep, their, goods, at, artificially, low, prices, under, threat, of, death, on, 18, september, 1948, an, indonesian, soviet, republic, was, declared, in, madiun, east, of, yogyakarta, by, members, of, the, pki, and, the, indonesian, socialist, party, psi, judging, the, time, right, for, a, proletarian, uprising, they, intended, it, to, be, a, rallying, point, for, revolt, against, sukarno, hatta, the, slaves, of, the, japanese, and, america, madiun, however, was, won, back, by, republican, forces, within, a, few, weeks, and, the, insurgency, leader, musso, killed, ario, soerjo, the, governor, of, east, java, as, well, as, several, police, officers, and, religious, leaders, were, killed, by, the, rebels, this, ended, a, distraction, for, the, revolution, and, it, turned, vague, american, sympathies, based, on, anti, colonial, sentiments, into, diplomatic, support, internationally, the, republic, was, now, seen, as, being, staunchly, anti, communist, and, a, potential, ally, in, the, emerging, global, cold, war, between, the, american, led, free, world, and, the, soviet, led, bloc, members, of, the, republican, army, who, had, come, from, indonesian, hizbullah, felt, betrayed, by, the, indonesian, government, for, ratifying, the, renville, agreement, therefore, recognising, many, areas, behind, the, van, mook, line, as, de, jure, dutch, in, may, 1948, they, declared, a, break,

sympathised, with, the, rebellion, after, the, republic, regained, all, territories, in, 1950, the, government, took, the, darul, islam, threat, seriously, especially, after, some, provinces,
