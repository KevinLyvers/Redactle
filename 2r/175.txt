https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoan_civilization
the, minoan, civilization, was, a, bronze, age, culture, which, was, centered, on, the, island, of, crete, known, for, its, monumental, architecture, and, energetic, art, it, is, often, regarded, as, the, first, civilization, in, europe, the, ruins, of, the, minoan, palaces, at, knossos, and, phaistos, are, popular, tourist, attractions, the, minoan, civilization, developed, from, the, local, neolithic, culture, around, 3100, bc, with, complex, urban, settlements, beginning, around, 2000, bc, after, c, 1450, bc, they, came, under, the, cultural, and, perhaps, political, domination, of, the, mainland, mycenaean, greeks, forming, a, hybrid, culture, which, lasted, until, around, 1100, bc, minoan, art, included, elaborately, decorated, pottery, seals, figurines, and, colorful, frescoes, typical, subjects, include, nature, and, ritual, minoan, art, is, often, described, as, having, a, fantastical, or, ecstatic, quality, with, figures, rendered, in, a, manner, suggesting, motion, little, is, known, about, the, structure, of, minoan, society, minoan, art, contains, no, unambiguous, depiction, of, a, monarch, and, textual, evidence, suggests, they, may, have, had, some, other, form, of, governance, likewise, it, is, unclear, whether, there, was, ever, a, unified, minoan, state, religious, practices, included, worship, at, peak, sanctuaries, and, sacred, caves, but, nothing, is, certain, regarding, their, pantheon, the, minoans, constructed, enormous, labyrinthine, buildings, which, their, initial, excavators, labeled, minoan, palaces, subsequent, research, has, shown, that, they, served, a, variety, of, religious, and, economic, purposes, rather, than, being, royal, residences, though, their, exact, role, in, minoan, society, is, a, matter, of, continuing, debate, the, minoans, traded, extensively, exporting, agricultural, products, and, luxury, crafts, in, exchange, for, raw, metals, which, were, difficult, to, obtain, on, crete, through, traders, and, artisans, their, cultural, influence, reached, beyond, crete, to, the, aegean, and, eastern, mediterranean, minoan, craftsmen, were, employed, by, foreign, elites, for, instance, to, paint, frescoes, at, avaris, in, egypt, the, minoans, developed, two, writing, systems, known, as, cretan, hieroglyphs, and, linear, a, because, neither, script, has, been, fully, deciphered, the, identity, of, the, minoan, language, is, unknown, based, on, what, is, known, the, language, is, regarded, as, unlikely, to, belong, to, a, well, attested, language, family, such, as, indo, european, or, semitic, after, 1450, bc, a, modified, version, of, linear, a, known, as, linear, b, was, used, to, write, mycenaean, greek, which, had, become, the, language, of, administration, on, crete, the, eteocretan, language, attested, in, a, few, post, bronze, age, inscriptions, may, be, a, descendant, of, the, minoan, language, largely, forgotten, after, the, late, bronze, age, collapse, the, minoan, civilization, was, rediscovered, in, the, early, twentieth, century, through, archaeological, excavation, the, term, minoan, was, coined, by, arthur, evans, who, excavated, at, knossos, and, recognized, it, as, culturally, distinct, from, the, mainland, mycenaean, culture, soon, after, federico, halbherr, and, luigi, pernier, excavated, the, palace, of, phaistos, and, the, nearby, settlement, of, hagia, triada, a, major, breakthrough, occurred, in, 1952, when, michael, ventris, deciphered, linear, b, drawing, on, earlier, work, by, alice, kober, this, decipherment, unlocked, a, crucial, source, of, information, on, the, economics, and, social, organization, in, the, final, year, of, the, palace, minoan, sites, continue, to, be, excavated, recent, discoveries, including, the, necropolis, at, armeni, and, the, harbour, town, of, kommos, the, modern, term, minoan, is, derived, from, the, name, of, the, mythical, king, minos, who, the, classical, greeks, believed, to, have, ruled, knossos, in, the, distant, past, it, was, popularized, by, arthur, evans, possibly, drawing, on, an, earlier, suggestion, by, karl, hoeck, it, is, a, modern, coinage, and, not, used, by, the, minoans, whose, name, for, themselves, is, unknown, the, egyptians, referred, to, the, minoans, as, the, kftjw, vocalized, as, keftiu, in, modern, egyptological, pronunciation, it, is, not, known, whether, this, was, an, exonym, or, if, it, was, an, endonym, originating, in, the, minoan, language, potentially, related, terms, were, used, by, a, variety, of, near, eastern, cultures, and, the, biblical, term, caphtor, has, sometimes, been, identified, with, crete, two, systems, of, relative, chronology, are, used, for, the, minoans, the, first, based, on, pottery, styles, divides, minoan, history, into, three, major, periods, early, minoan, em, middle, minoan, mm, and, late, minoan, lm, these, periods, can, be, divided, using, roman, numerals, e, g, em, i, em, ii, em, iii, which, can, be, further, divided, using, capital, letters, e, g, lm, iiia, lmiiib, lm, iiic, an, alternative, system, proposed, by, greek, archaeologist, nikolaos, platon, divides, minoan, history, into, four, periods, termed, prepalatial, protopalatial, neopalatial, and, postpalatial, establishing, an, absolute, chronology, has, proved, difficult, archaeologists, have, attempted, to, determine, calendar, dates, by, synchronizing, the, periods, of, minoan, history, with, those, of, their, better, understood, contemporaries, for, example, minoan, artifacts, from, the, lm, ib, period, have, been, found, in, 18th, dynasty, contexts, in, egypt, for, which, egyptian, chronology, provides, calendar, dates, however, dates, determined, in, this, manner, do, not, always, match, the, results, of, carbon, dating, and, other, methods, based, on, natural, science, much, of, the, controversy, concerns, the, dating, of, the, eruption, of, thera, which, is, known, to, have, occurred, towards, the, end, of, the, lm, ia, period, while, carbon, dating, places, this, event, and, thus, lm, ia, around, 1600, bc, synchronism, with, egyptian, records, would, place, it, roughly, a, century, later, although, stone, tool, evidence, suggests, that, hominins, may, have, reached, crete, as, early, as, 130, 000, years, ago, evidence, for, the, first, anatomically, modern, human, presence, dates, to, 10, 000, 12, 000, ybp, the, oldest, evidence, of, modern, human, habitation, on, crete, is, pre, ceramic, neolithic, farming, community, remains, which, date, to, about, 7000, bc, a, comparative, study, of, dna, haplogroups, of, modern, cretan, men, showed, that, a, male, founder, group, from, anatolia, or, the, levant, is, shared, with, the, greeks, the, neolithic, population, lived, in, open, villages, fishermen, s, huts, were, found, on, the, shores, and, the, fertile, messara, plain, was, used, for, agriculture, early, minoan, society, developed, largely, continuously, from, local, neolithic, predecessors, with, some, cultural, influence, and, perhaps, migration, from, eastern, populations, this, period, saw, a, gradual, shift, from, localized, clan, based, villages, towards, the, more, urbanized, and, stratified, society, of, later, periods, em, i, c, 3100, 2650, bc, is, marked, by, the, appearance, of, the, first, painted, ceramics, continuing, a, trend, that, began, during, the, neolithic, settlements, grew, in, size, and, complexity, and, spread, from, fertile, plains, towards, highland, sites, and, islands, as, the, minoans, learned, to, exploit, less, hospitable, terrain, em, ii, c, 2650, 2200, bc, has, been, termed, an, international, era, trade, intensified, and, minoan, ships, began, sailing, beyond, the, aegean, to, egypt, and, syria, possibly, enabled, by, the, invention, of, masted, ships, minoan, material, culture, shows, increased, international, influence, for, instance, in, the, adoption, of, minoan, seals, based, on, the, older, near, eastern, seal, minoan, settlements, grew, some, doubling, in, size, and, monumental, buildings, were, constructed, at, sites, that, would, later, become, palaces, em, iii, c, 2200, 2100, bc, saw, the, continuation, of, these, trends, mm, i, c, 2100, 1875, bc, saw, the, emergence, of, protopalatial, society, during, mm, ia, c, 2100, 1925, bc, populations, increased, dramatically, at, sites, such, as, knossos, phaistos, and, malia, accompanied, by, major, construction, projects, during, mm, ib, c, 1925, 1875, bc, the, first, palaces, were, built, at, these, sites, in, areas, which, had, been, used, for, communal, ceremonies, since, the, neolithic, middle, minoan, artisans, developed, new, colorful, paints, and, adopted, the, potter, s, wheel, during, mm, ib, producing, wares, such, as, kamares, ware, mm, ii, c, 1875, 1700, bc, saw, the, development, of, the, minoan, writing, systems, cretan, hieroglyphic, and, linear, a, it, ended, with, mass, destructions, generally, attributed, to, earthquakes, though, violent, destruction, has, been, considered, as, an, alternative, explanation, mm, iii, c, 1750, 1700, bc, marks, the, beginning, of, the, neopalatial, period, most, of, the, palaces, were, rebuilt, with, architectural, innovations, with, the, notable, exception, of, phaistos, cretan, hieroglyphs, were, abandoned, in, favor, of, linear, a, and, minoan, cultural, influence, becomes, significant, in, mainland, greece, the, late, minoan, period, was, an, eventful, time, that, saw, profound, change, in, minoan, society, many, of, the, most, recognizable, minoan, artifacts, date, from, this, time, for, instance, the, snake, goddess, figurines, la, parisienne, fresco, and, the, marine, style, of, pottery, decoration, late, minoan, i, c, 1700, 1470, bc, was, a, continuation, of, the, prosperous, neopalatial, culture, a, notable, event, from, this, era, was, the, eruption, of, the, thera, volcano, which, occurred, around, 1600, bc, towards, the, end, of, the, lm, ia, subperiod, one, of, the, largest, volcanic, explosions, in, recorded, history, it, ejected, about, 60, to, 100, cubic, kilometres, 14, to, 24, cu, mi, of, material, and, was, measured, at, 7, on, the, volcanic, explosivity, index, while, the, eruption, destroyed, cycladic, settlements, such, as, akrotiri, and, led, to, the, abandonment, of, some, sites, in, northeast, crete, other, minoan, sites, such, as, knossos, continued, to, prosper, the, post, eruption, lm, ib, period, c, 1625, 1470, saw, ambitious, new, building, projects, booming, international, trade, and, artistic, developments, such, as, the, marine, style, late, minoan, ib, c, 1625, 1470, bc, ended, with, severe, destructions, throughout, the, island, marking, the, end, of, neopalatial, society, these, destructions, are, thought, to, have, been, deliberate, since, they, spared, certain, sites, in, a, manner, inconsistent, with, natural, disasters, for, instance, the, town, at, knossos, burned, while, the, palace, itself, did, not, the, causes, of, these, destructions, have, been, a, perennial, topic, of, debate, while, some, researchers, attributed, them, to, mycenaean, conquerors, others, have, argued, that, they, were, the, result, of, internal, upheavals, similarly, while, some, researchers, have, attempted, to, link, them, to, lingering, environmental, disruption, from, the, thera, eruption, others, have, argued, that, the, two, events, are, too, distant, in, time, for, any, causal, relation, late, minoan, ii, c, 1470, 1420, bc, is, sparsely, represented, in, the, archaeological, record, but, appears, to, have, been, a, period, of, decline, late, minoan, iii, c, 1420, 1075, bc, shows, profound, social, and, political, changes, among, the, palaces, only, knossos, remained, in, use, though, it, too, was, destroyed, by, lm, iiib2, the, language, of, administration, shifted, to, mycenaean, greek, and, material, culture, shows, increased, mainland, influence, reflecting, the, rise, of, a, greek, speaking, elite, in, late, minoan, iiic, c, 1200, 1075, bc, coinciding, with, the, wider, late, bronze, age, collapse, coastal, settlements, were, abandoned, in, favor, of, defensible, locations, on, higher, ground, these, small, villages, some, of, which, grew, out, of, earlier, mountain, shrines, continued, aspects, of, recognizably, minoan, culture, until, the, early, iron, age, the, minoan, civilization, was, centered, on, the, island, of, crete, with, additional, settlements, around, the, aegean, sea, crete, is, located, in, the, south, of, the, aegean, situated, along, maritime, trade, routes, that, connect, europe, africa, and, the, middle, east, because, it, straddles, the, mediterranean, and, african, climate, zones, with, land, at, a, variety, of, elevations, it, provides, a, diverse, array, of, natural, resources, however, it, is, notably, poor, in, metals, a, fact, believed, to, have, spurred, the, minoans, interest, in, international, trade, the, island, is, seismically, active, with, signs, of, earthquake, damage, at, many, minoan, sites, the, majority, of, minoan, sites, are, found, in, central, and, eastern, crete, with, few, in, the, western, part, of, the, island, especially, to, the, south, the, minoans, were, traders, and, their, cultural, contacts, reached, egypt, cyprus, canaan, and, the, levantine, coast, and, anatolia, minoan, style, frescoes, have, been, found, at, elite, residences, in, avaris, and, tel, kabri, minoan, techniques, and, ceramic, styles, had, varying, degrees, of, influence, on, helladic, greece, along, with, santorini, minoan, settlements, are, found, at, kastri, kythera, an, island, near, the, greek, mainland, influenced, by, the, minoans, from, the, mid, third, millennium, bc, emii, to, its, mycenaean, occupation, in, the, 13th, century, minoan, strata, replaced, a, mainland, derived, early, bronze, age, culture, the, earliest, minoan, settlement, outside, crete, the, cyclades, were, in, the, minoan, cultural, orbit, and, closer, to, crete, the, islands, of, karpathos, saria, and, kasos, also, contained, middle, bronze, age, mmi, ii, minoan, colonies, or, settlements, of, minoan, traders, most, were, abandoned, in, lmi, but, karpathos, recovered, and, continued, its, minoan, culture, until, the, end, of, the, bronze, age, other, supposed, minoan, colonies, such, as, that, hypothesized, by, adolf, furtw, ngler, on, aegina, were, later, dismissed, by, scholars, however, there, was, a, minoan, colony, at, ialysos, on, rhodes, minoan, cultural, influence, indicates, an, orbit, extending, through, the, cyclades, to, egypt, and, cyprus, fifteenth, century, bc, paintings, in, thebes, egypt, depict, minoan, appearing, individuals, bearing, gifts, inscriptions, describing, them, as, coming, from, keftiu, islands, in, the, middle, of, the, sea, may, refer, to, gift, bringing, merchants, or, officials, from, crete, some, locations, on, crete, indicate, that, the, minoans, were, an, outward, looking, society, the, neo, palatial, site, of, kato, zakros, is, located, within, 100, meters, of, the, modern, shoreline, in, a, bay, its, large, number, of, workshops, and, wealth, of, site, materials, indicate, a, possible, entrep, t, for, trade, such, activities, are, seen, in, artistic, representations, of, the, sea, including, the, ship, procession, or, flotilla, fresco, in, room, five, of, the, west, house, at, akrotiri, in, 2024, archaeologists, discovered, a, minoan, bronze, dagger, with, silver, rivets, in, an, ancient, shipwreck, at, kumluca, in, antalya, province, according, to, the, researchers, the, discovery, highlights, the, cultural, and, commercial, exchanges, in, the, mediterranean, during, the, bronze, age, minoan, art, is, marked, by, imaginative, images, and, exceptional, workmanship, sinclair, hood, described, an, essential, quality, of, the, finest, minoan, art, the, ability, to, create, an, atmosphere, of, movement, and, life, although, following, a, set, of, highly, formal, conventions, it, forms, part, of, the, wider, grouping, of, aegean, art, and, in, later, periods, came, for, a, time, to, have, a, dominant, influence, over, cycladic, art, wood, and, textiles, have, decomposed, so, most, surviving, examples, of, minoan, art, are, pottery, intricately, carved, minoan, seals, palace, frescos, which, include, landscapes, but, are, often, mostly, reconstructed, small, sculptures, in, various, materials, jewellery, and, metalwork, the, relationship, of, minoan, art, to, that, of, other, contemporary, cultures, and, later, ancient, greek, art, has, been, much, discussed, it, clearly, dominated, mycenaean, art, and, cycladic, art, of, the, same, periods, even, after, crete, was, occupied, by, the, mycenaeans, but, only, some, aspects, of, the, tradition, survived, the, greek, dark, ages, after, the, collapse, of, mycenaean, greece, minoan, art, has, a, variety, of, subject, matter, much, of, it, appearing, across, different, media, although, only, some, styles, of, pottery, include, figurative, scenes, bull, leaping, appears, in, painting, and, several, types, of, sculpture, and, is, thought, to, have, had, a, religious, significance, bull, s, heads, are, also, a, popular, subject, in, terracotta, and, other, sculptural, materials, there, are, no, figures, that, appear, to, be, portraits, of, individuals, or, are, clearly, royal, and, the, identities, of, religious, figures, is, often, tentative, with, scholars, uncertain, whether, they, are, deities, clergy, or, devotees, equally, whether, painted, rooms, were, shrines, or, secular, is, far, from, clear, one, room, in, akrotiri, has, been, argued, to, be, a, bedroom, with, remains, of, a, bed, or, a, shrine, animals, including, an, unusual, variety, of, marine, fauna, are, often, depicted, the, marine, style, is, a, type, of, painted, palace, pottery, from, mm, iii, and, lm, ia, that, paints, sea, creatures, including, octopus, spreading, all, over, the, vessel, and, probably, originated, from, similar, frescoed, scenes, sometimes, these, appear, in, other, media, scenes, of, hunting, and, warfare, and, horses, and, riders, are, mostly, found, in, later, periods, in, works, perhaps, made, by, cretans, for, a, mycenaean, market, or, mycenaean, overlords, of, crete, while, minoan, figures, whether, human, or, animal, have, a, great, sense, of, life, and, movement, they, are, often, not, very, accurate, and, the, species, is, sometimes, impossible, to, identify, by, comparison, with, ancient, egyptian, art, they, are, often, more, vivid, but, less, naturalistic, in, comparison, with, the, art, of, other, ancient, cultures, there, is, a, high, proportion, of, female, figures, though, the, idea, that, minoans, had, only, goddesses, and, no, gods, is, now, discounted, most, human, figures, are, in, profile, or, in, a, version, of, the, egyptian, convention, with, the, head, and, legs, in, profile, and, the, torso, seen, frontally, but, the, minoan, figures, exaggerate, features, such, as, slim, male, waists, and, large, female, breasts, what, is, called, landscape, painting, is, found, in, both, frescos, and, on, painted, pots, and, sometimes, in, other, media, but, most, of, the, time, this, consists, of, plants, shown, fringing, a, scene, or, dotted, around, within, it, there, is, a, particular, visual, convention, where, the, surroundings, of, the, main, subject, are, laid, out, as, though, seen, from, above, though, individual, specimens, are, shown, in, profile, this, accounts, for, the, rocks, being, shown, all, round, a, scene, with, flowers, apparently, growing, down, from, the, top, the, seascapes, surrounding, some, scenes, of, fish, and, of, boats, and, in, the, ship, procession, miniature, fresco, from, akrotiri, land, with, a, settlement, as, well, give, a, wider, landscape, than, is, usual, the, largest, and, best, collection, of, minoan, art, is, in, the, heraklion, archaeological, museum, amh, near, knossos, on, the, northern, coast, of, crete, many, different, styles, of, potted, wares, and, techniques, of, production, are, observable, throughout, the, history, of, crete, early, minoan, ceramics, were, characterized, by, patterns, of, spirals, triangles, curved, lines, crosses, fish, bones, and, beak, spouts, however, while, many, of, the, artistic, motifs, are, similar, in, the, early, minoan, period, there, are, many, differences, that, appear, in, the, reproduction, of, these, techniques, throughout, the, island, which, represent, a, variety, of, shifts, in, taste, as, well, as, in, power, structures, there, were, also, many, small, terracotta, figurines, during, the, middle, minoan, period, naturalistic, designs, such, as, fish, squid, birds, and, lilies, were, common, in, the, late, minoan, period, flowers, and, animals, were, still, characteristic, but, more, variety, existed, however, in, contrast, to, later, ancient, greek, vase, painting, paintings, of, human, figures, are, extremely, rare, and, those, of, land, mammals, not, common, until, late, periods, shapes, and, ornament, were, often, borrowed, from, metal, tableware, that, has, largely, not, survived, while, painted, decoration, probably, mostly, derives, from, frescos, minoan, jewellery, has, mostly, been, recovered, from, graves, and, until, the, later, periods, much, of, it, consists, of, diadems, and, ornaments, for, women, s, hair, though, there, are, also, the, universal, types, of, rings, bracelets, armlets, and, necklaces, and, many, thin, pieces, that, were, sewn, onto, clothing, in, the, earlier, periods, gold, was, the, main, material, typically, hammered, very, thin, but, later, it, seemed, to, become, scarce, the, minoans, created, elaborate, metalwork, with, imported, gold, and, copper, bead, necklaces, bracelets, and, hair, ornaments, appear, in, the, frescoes, and, many, labrys, pins, survive, the, minoans, mastered, granulation, as, indicated, by, the, malia, pendant, a, gold, pendant, featuring, bees, on, a, honeycomb, this, was, overlooked, by, the, 19th, century, looters, of, a, royal, burial, site, they, called, the, gold, hole, fine, decorated, bronze, weapons, have, been, found, in, crete, especially, from, lm, periods, but, they, are, far, less, prominent, than, in, the, remains, of, warrior, ruled, mycenae, where, the, famous, shaft, grave, burials, contain, many, very, richly, decorated, swords, and, daggers, in, contrast, spears, and, slashing, knives, tend, to, be, severely, functional, many, of, the, decorated, weapons, were, probably, made, either, in, crete, or, by, cretans, working, on, the, mainland, daggers, are, often, the, most, lavishly, decorated, with, gold, hilts, that, may, be, set, with, jewels, and, the, middle, of, the, blade, decorated, with, a, variety, of, techniques, the, most, famous, of, these, are, a, few, inlaid, with, elaborate, scenes, in, gold, and, silver, set, against, a, black, or, now, black, niello, background, whose, actual, material, and, technique, have, been, much, discussed, these, have, long, thin, scenes, running, along, the, centre, of, the, blade, which, show, the, violence, typical, of, the, art, of, mycenaean, greece, as, well, as, a, sophistication, in, both, technique, and, figurative, imagery, that, is, startlingly, original, in, a, greek, context, metal, vessels, were, produced, in, crete, from, at, least, as, early, as, em, ii, c, 2500, bc, in, the, prepalatial, period, through, to, lm, ia, c, 1450, bc, in, the, postpalatial, period, and, perhaps, as, late, as, lm, iiib, c, c, 1200, bc, although, it, is, likely, that, many, of, the, vessels, from, these, later, periods, were, heirlooms, from, earlier, periods, the, earliest, were, probably, made, exclusively, from, precious, metals, but, from, the, protopalatial, period, mm, ib, mm, iia, they, were, also, produced, in, arsenical, bronze, and, subsequently, tin, bronze, the, archaeological, record, suggests, that, mostly, cup, type, forms, were, created, in, precious, metals, but, the, corpus, of, bronze, vessels, was, diverse, including, cauldrons, pans, hydrias, bowls, pitchers, basins, cups, ladles, and, lamps, the, minoan, metal, vessel, tradition, influenced, that, of, the, mycenaean, culture, on, mainland, greece, and, they, are, often, regarded, as, the, same, tradition, many, precious, metal, vessels, found, on, mainland, greece, exhibit, minoan, characteristics, and, it, is, thought, that, these, were, either, imported, from, crete, or, made, on, the, mainland, by, minoan, metalsmiths, working, for, mycenaean, patrons, or, by, mycenaean, smiths, who, had, trained, under, minoan, masters, the, minoans, raised, cattle, sheep, pigs, and, goats, and, grew, wheat, barley, vetch, and, chickpeas, they, also, cultivated, grapes, figs, and, olives, grew, poppies, for, seed, and, perhaps, opium, the, minoans, also, domesticated, bees, vegetables, including, lettuce, celery, asparagus, and, carrots, grew, wild, on, crete, pear, quince, and, olive, trees, were, also, native, date, palm, trees, and, cats, for, hunting, were, imported, from, egypt, the, minoans, adopted, pomegranates, from, the, near, east, but, not, lemons, and, oranges, they, may, have, practiced, polyculture, and, their, varied, healthy, diet, resulted, in, a, population, increase, polyculture, theoretically, maintains, soil, fertility, and, protects, against, losses, due, to, crop, failure, linear, b, tablets, indicate, the, importance, of, orchards, figs, olives, and, grapes, in, processing, crops, for, secondary, products, olive, oil, in, cretan, or, mediterranean, cuisine, is, comparable, to, butter, in, northern, european, cuisine, the, process, of, fermenting, wine, from, grapes, was, probably, a, factor, of, the, palace, economies, wine, would, have, been, a, trade, commodity, and, an, item, of, domestic, consumption, farmers, used, wooden, plows, bound, with, leather, to, wooden, handles, and, pulled, by, pairs, of, donkeys, or, oxen, seafood, was, also, important, in, cretan, cuisine, the, prevalence, of, edible, molluscs, in, site, material, and, artistic, representations, of, marine, fish, and, animals, including, the, distinctive, marine, style, pottery, such, as, the, lm, iiic, octopus, stirrup, jar, indicate, appreciation, and, occasional, use, of, fish, by, the, economy, however, scholars, believe, that, these, resources, were, not, as, significant, as, grain, olives, and, animal, produce, fishing, was, one, of, the, major, activities, but, there, is, as, yet, no, evidence, for, the, way, in, which, they, organized, their, fishing, an, intensification, of, agricultural, activity, is, indicated, by, the, construction, of, terraces, and, dams, at, pseira, in, the, late, minoan, period, cretan, cuisine, included, wild, game, cretans, ate, wild, deer, wild, boar, and, meat, from, livestock, wild, game, is, now, extinct, on, crete, a, matter, of, controversy, is, whether, minoans, made, use, of, the, indigenous, cretan, megafauna, which, are, typically, thought, to, have, been, extinct, considerably, earlier, at, 10, 000, bc, this, is, in, part, due, to, the, possible, presence, of, dwarf, elephants, in, contemporary, egyptian, art, not, all, plants, and, flora, were, purely, functional, and, arts, depict, scenes, of, lily, gathering, in, green, spaces, the, fresco, known, as, the, sacred, grove, at, knossos, depicts, women, facing, left, flanked, by, trees, some, scholars, have, suggested, that, it, is, a, harvest, festival, or, ceremony, to, honor, the, fertility, of, the, soil, artistic, depictions, of, farming, scenes, also, appear, on, the, harvester, vase, an, egg, shaped, rhyton, which, depicts, 27, men, led, by, another, carrying, bunches, of, sticks, to, beat, ripe, olives, from, the, trees, the, discovery, of, storage, areas, in, the, palace, compounds, has, prompted, debate, at, the, second, palace, at, phaistos, rooms, on, the, west, side, of, the, structure, have, been, identified, as, a, storage, area, jars, jugs, and, vessels, have, been, recovered, in, the, area, indicating, the, complex, s, possible, role, as, a, re, distribution, center, for, agricultural, produce, at, larger, sites, such, as, knossos, there, is, evidence, of, craft, specialization, workshops, the, palace, at, kato, zakro, indicates, that, workshops, were, integrated, into, palace, structure, the, minoan, palatial, system, may, have, developed, through, economic, intensification, where, an, agricultural, surplus, could, support, a, population, of, administrators, craftsmen, and, religious, practitioners, the, number, of, sleeping, rooms, in, the, palaces, indicates, that, they, could, have, supported, a, sizable, population, which, was, removed, from, manual, labor, tools, originally, made, of, wood, or, bone, were, bound, to, handles, with, leather, straps, during, the, bronze, age, they, were, made, of, bronze, with, wooden, handles, due, to, its, round, hole, the, tool, head, would, spin, on, the, handle, the, minoans, developed, oval, shaped, holes, in, their, tools, to, fit, oval, shaped, handles, which, prevented, spinning, tools, included, double, adzes, double, and, single, bladed, axes, axe, adzes, sickles, and, chisels, apart, from, the, abundant, local, agriculture, the, minoans, were, also, a, mercantile, people, who, engaged, significantly, in, overseas, trade, and, at, their, peak, may, well, have, had, a, dominant, position, in, international, trade, over, much, of, the, mediterranean, after, 1700, bc, their, culture, indicates, a, high, degree, of, organization, minoan, manufactured, goods, suggest, a, network, of, trade, with, mainland, greece, notably, mycenae, cyprus, syria, anatolia, egypt, mesopotamia, and, westward, as, far, as, the, iberian, peninsula, minoan, religion, apparently, focused, on, female, deities, with, women, officiants, while, historians, and, archaeologists, have, long, been, skeptical, of, an, outright, matriarchy, the, predominance, of, female, figures, in, authoritative, roles, over, male, ones, seems, to, indicate, that, minoan, society, was, matriarchal, and, among, the, most, well, supported, examples, known, the, term, palace, economy, first, gained, popularity, among, minoan, researchers, it, is, now, used, as, a, general, term, for, ancient, pre, monetary, cultures, where, much, of, the, economy, revolved, around, the, collection, of, crops, and, other, goods, by, centralized, government, or, religious, institutions, the, two, tending, to, go, together, for, redistribution, to, the, population, this, is, still, accepted, as, an, important, part, of, the, minoan, economy, all, the, palaces, have, very, large, amounts, of, space, that, seems, to, have, been, used, for, storage, of, agricultural, produce, some, remains, of, which, have, been, excavated, after, they, were, buried, by, disasters, what, role, if, any, the, palaces, played, in, minoan, international, trade, is, unknown, or, how, this, was, organized, in, other, ways, the, decipherment, of, linear, a, would, possibly, shed, light, on, this, very, little, is, known, about, the, forms, of, minoan, government, particularly, since, the, minoan, language, has, not, yet, been, deciphered, it, used, to, be, believed, that, the, minoans, had, a, monarchy, supported, by, a, bureaucracy, this, might, initially, have, been, a, number, of, monarchies, corresponding, with, the, palaces, around, crete, but, later, all, taken, over, by, knossos, which, was, itself, later, occupied, by, mycenaean, overlords, but, in, notable, contrast, to, contemporary, egyptian, and, mesopotamian, civilizations, minoan, iconography, contains, no, pictures, of, recognizable, kings, 175, and, in, recent, decades, it, has, come, to, be, thought, that, before, the, presumed, mycenaean, invasion, around, 1450, bc, a, group, of, elite, families, presumably, living, in, the, villas, and, the, palaces, controlled, both, government, and, religion, rejecting, both, a, monarchy, and, an, aristocracy, david, graeber, and, david, wengrow, recently, concluded, pretty, much, all, the, available, evidence, from, minoan, crete, suggests, a, system, of, female, political, rule, effectively, a, theocracy, of, some, sort, governed, by, a, college, of, priestesses, as, linear, a, minoan, writing, has, not, been, deciphered, yet, most, information, available, about, minoan, women, is, from, various, art, forms, and, linear, b, tablets, and, scholarship, about, minoan, women, remains, limited, minoan, society, was, a, divided, society, separating, men, from, women, in, art, illustration, clothing, and, societal, duties, for, example, documents, written, in, linear, b, have, been, found, documenting, minoan, families, wherein, spouses, and, children, are, not, all, listed, together, in, one, section, fathers, were, listed, with, their, sons, while, mothers, were, listed, with, their, daughters, in, a, completely, different, section, apart, from, the, men, who, lived, in, the, same, household, signifying, the, vast, gender, divide, present, in, minoan, society, artistically, women, were, portrayed, very, differently, from, men, men, were, often, artistically, represented, with, dark, skin, while, women, were, represented, with, lighter, skin, minoan, dress, representation, also, clearly, marks, the, difference, between, men, and, women, minoan, men, were, often, depicted, clad, in, little, clothing, while, women, s, bodies, specifically, later, on, were, more, covered, up, while, there, is, evidence, that, the, structure, of, women, s, clothing, originated, as, a, mirror, to, the, clothing, that, men, wore, fresco, art, illustrates, how, women, s, clothing, evolved, to, be, increasingly, elaborate, throughout, the, minoan, era, throughout, the, evolution, of, women, s, clothing, a, strong, emphasis, was, placed, on, the, women, s, sexual, characteristics, particularly, the, breasts, female, clothing, throughout, the, minoan, era, emphasized, the, breasts, by, exposing, cleavage, or, even, the, entire, breast, both, minoan, women, and, men, were, portrayed, with, wasp, waists, similar, to, the, modern, bodice, women, continue, to, wear, today, fresco, paintings, portray, three, class, levels, of, women, elite, women, women, of, the, masses, and, servants, a, fourth, smaller, class, of, women, are, also, included, among, some, paintings, women, who, participated, in, religious, and, sacred, tasks, elite, women, were, depicted, in, paintings, as, having, a, stature, twice, the, size, of, women, in, lower, classes, as, this, was, a, way, of, emphasizing, the, important, difference, between, the, elite, wealthy, women, and, the, rest, of, the, female, population, within, society, childcare, was, a, central, job, for, women, within, minoan, society, other, roles, outside, the, household, that, have, been, identified, as, women, s, duties, are, food, gathering, food, preparation, and, household, care, taking, additionally, it, has, been, found, that, women, were, represented, in, the, artisan, world, as, ceramic, and, textile, craftswomen, as, women, got, older, it, can, be, assumed, that, their, job, of, taking, care, of, children, ended, and, they, transitioned, towards, household, management, and, job, mentoring, teaching, younger, women, the, jobs, that, they, themselves, participated, in, while, women, were, often, portrayed, in, paintings, as, caretakers, of, children, pregnant, women, were, rarely, shown, in, frescoes, pregnant, women, were, instead, represented, in, the, form, of, sculpted, pots, with, the, rounded, base, of, the, pots, representing, the, pregnant, belly, additionally, no, minoan, art, forms, portray, women, giving, birth, breast, feeding, or, procreating, lack, of, such, actions, leads, historians, to, believe, that, these, actions, would, have, been, recognized, by, minoan, society, to, be, either, sacred, or, inappropriate, and, kept, private, within, society, childbirth, was, a, dangerous, process, within, minoan, society, archeological, sources, have, found, numerous, bones, of, pregnant, women, identified, by, the, fetus, bones, within, their, skeleton, found, in, the, abdomen, area, providing, strong, evidence, that, death, during, pregnancy, and, childbirth, were, common, features, within, society, sheep, wool, was, the, main, fibre, used, in, textiles, and, perhaps, a, significant, export, commodity, linen, from, flax, was, probably, much, less, common, and, possibly, imported, from, egypt, or, grown, locally, there, is, no, evidence, of, silk, but, some, use, is, possible, as, seen, in, minoan, art, minoan, men, wore, loincloths, if, poor, or, robes, or, kilts, that, were, often, long, women, wore, long, dresses, with, short, sleeves, and, layered, flounced, skirts, with, both, sexes, there, was, a, great, emphasis, in, art, in, a, small, wasp, waist, often, taken, to, improbable, extremes, both, sexes, are, often, shown, with, rather, thick, belts, or, girdles, at, the, waist, women, could, also, wear, a, strapless, fitted, bodice, and, clothing, patterns, had, symmetrical, geometric, designs, men, are, shown, as, clean, shaven, and, male, hair, was, short, in, styles, that, would, be, common, today, except, for, some, long, thin, tresses, at, the, back, perhaps, for, young, elite, males, female, hair, is, typically, shown, with, long, tresses, falling, at, the, back, as, in, the, fresco, fragment, known, as, la, parisienne, this, got, its, name, because, when, it, was, found, in, the, early, 20th, century, a, french, art, historian, thought, it, resembled, parisian, women, of, the, day, children, are, shown, in, art, with, shaved, heads, often, blue, in, art, except, for, a, few, very, long, locks, the, rest, of, the, hair, is, allowed, to, grow, as, they, approach, puberty, this, can, be, seen, in, the, akrotiri, boxer, fresco, two, famous, minoan, snake, goddess, figurines, from, knossos, one, illustrated, below, show, bodices, that, circle, their, breasts, but, do, not, cover, them, at, all, these, striking, figures, have, dominated, the, popular, image, of, minoan, clothing, and, have, been, copied, in, some, reconstructions, of, largely, destroyed, frescos, but, few, images, unambiguously, show, this, costume, and, the, status, of, the, figures, goddesses, priestesses, or, devotees, is, not, at, all, clear, what, is, clear, from, pieces, like, the, agia, triada, sarcophagus, is, that, minoan, women, normally, covered, their, breasts, priestesses, in, religious, contexts, may, have, been, an, exception, this, shows, a, funeral, sacrifice, and, some, figures, of, both, sexes, are, wearing, aprons, or, skirts, of, animal, hide, apparently, left, with, the, hair, on, this, was, probably, the, costume, worn, by, both, sexes, by, those, engaged, in, rituals, minoan, jewellery, included, many, gold, ornaments, for, women, s, hair, and, also, thin, gold, plaques, to, sew, onto, clothing, flowers, were, also, often, worn, in, the, hair, as, by, the, poppy, goddess, terracotta, figurine, and, other, figures, frescos, also, show, what, are, presumably, woven, or, embroidered, figures, human, and, animal, spaced, out, on, clothing, the, minoans, used, a, number, of, different, scripts, during, the, palatial, period, the, primary, scripts, were, linear, a, and, cretan, hieroglyphs, the, latter, falling, out, of, use, in, mm, iii, the, origins, of, these, scripts, is, unknown, although, cretan, hieroglyphic, is, often, assumed, to, have, been, inspired, by, egyptian, hieroglyphs, anatolian, and, mesopotamian, writing, systems, have, also, been, considered, as, models, neither, script, has, been, deciphered, despite, numerous, attempts, for, instance, when, the, values, of, the, symbols, in, linear, b, are, used, in, linear, a, they, produce, mostly, unrecognizable, words, the, language, encoded, by, these, scripts, is, tentatively, dubbed, minoan, though, it, is, not, certain, that, it, was, a, single, language, decipherment, attempts, have, attempted, to, read, the, language, as, indo, european, semitic, and, tyrsenian, languages, but, none, have, resulted, in, an, accepted, decipherment, the, post, bronze, age, eteocretan, language, has, been, considered, as, a, potential, descendant, of, minoan, however, this, language, is, only, known, from, five, inscriptions, in, eastern, crete, and, is, thus, itself, poorly, understood, linear, b, became, the, primary, cretan, script, after, lm, ii, this, script, was, adapted, from, the, earlier, linear, a, in, order, to, write, mycenaean, greek, which, had, become, the, language, of, administration, linear, b, was, deciphered, in, 1952, unlocking, a, major, source, of, textual, evidence, about, the, economics, and, social, organization, of, the, final, year, at, the, palace, of, knossos, a, handful, of, minoan, inscriptions, use, other, unknown, writing, systems, for, instance, the, phaistos, disc, features, a, pictorial, script, whose, only, close, comparison, is, found, on, the, arkalochori, axe, because, so, few, instances, of, these, scripts, have, been, found, they, remain, undeciphered, arthur, evans, thought, the, minoans, worshipped, more, or, less, exclusively, a, mother, goddess, which, heavily, influenced, views, for, decades, recent, scholarly, opinion, sees, a, much, more, diverse, religious, landscape, although, the, absence, of, texts, or, even, readable, relevant, inscriptions, leaves, the, picture, very, cloudy, we, have, no, names, of, deities, until, after, the, mycenaean, era, much, minoan, art, is, given, a, religious, significance, of, some, sort, but, this, tends, to, be, vague, not, least, because, minoan, government, is, now, often, seen, as, a, theocracy, so, politics, and, religion, have, a, considerable, overlap, the, minoan, pantheon, featured, many, deities, among, which, a, young, spear, wielding, male, god, is, also, prominent, some, scholars, see, in, the, minoan, goddess, a, female, divine, solar, figure, it, is, very, often, difficult, to, distinguish, between, images, of, worshipers, priests, and, priestesses, rulers, and, deities, indeed, the, priestly, and, royal, roles, may, have, often, been, the, same, as, leading, rituals, is, often, seen, as, the, essence, of, rulership, possibly, as, aspects, of, the, main, probably, dominant, nature, mother, goddess, archaeologists, have, identified, a, mountain, goddess, worshipped, at, peak, sanctuaries, a, dove, goddess, a, snake, goddess, perhaps, protectress, of, the, household, the, potnia, theron, goddess, of, animals, and, a, goddess, of, childbirth, late, minoan, terracotta, votive, figures, like, the, poppy, goddess, perhaps, a, worshipper, carry, attributes, often, birds, in, their, diadems, the, mythical, creature, called, the, minoan, genius, is, somewhat, threatening, but, perhaps, a, protective, figure, possibly, of, children, it, seems, to, largely, derive, from, taweret, the, egyptian, hybrid, crocodile, and, hippopotamus, goddess, men, with, a, special, role, as, priests, or, priest, kings, are, identifiable, by, diagonal, bands, on, their, long, robes, and, carrying, over, their, shoulder, a, ritual, axe, sceptre, with, a, rounded, blade, the, more, conventionally, shaped, labrys, or, double, headed, axe, is, a, very, common, votive, offering, probably, for, a, male, god, and, large, examples, of, the, horns, of, consecration, symbol, probably, representing, bull, s, horns, are, shown, on, seals, decorating, buildings, with, a, few, large, actual, survivals, bull, leaping, very, much, centred, on, knossos, is, agreed, to, have, a, religious, significance, perhaps, to, do, with, selecting, the, elite, the, position, of, the, bull, in, it, is, unclear, the, funeral, ceremonies, on, the, very, late, hagia, triada, sarcophagus, include, a, bull, sacrifice, the, saffron, may, have, had, a, religious, significance, according, to, nanno, marinatos, the, hierarchy, and, relationship, of, gods, within, the, pantheon, is, difficult, to, decode, from, the, images, alone, marinatos, disagrees, with, earlier, descriptions, of, minoan, religion, as, primitive, saying, that, it, was, the, religion, of, a, sophisticated, and, urbanized, palatial, culture, with, a, complex, social, hierarchy, it, was, not, dominated, by, fertility, any, more, than, any, religion, of, the, past, or, present, has, been, and, it, addressed, gender, identity, rites, of, passage, and, death, it, is, reasonable, to, assume, that, both, the, organization, and, the, rituals, even, the, mythology, resembled, the, religions, of, near, eastern, palatial, civilizations, it, even, seems, that, the, later, greek, pantheon, would, synthesize, the, minoan, female, deity, and, hittite, goddess, from, the, near, east, minoan, horn, topped, altars, which, arthur, evans, called, horns, of, consecration, are, represented, in, seal, impressions, and, have, been, found, as, far, afield, as, cyprus, minoan, sacred, symbols, include, the, bull, and, its, horns, of, consecration, the, labrys, double, headed, axe, the, pillar, the, serpent, the, sun, disc, the, tree, and, even, the, ankh, haralampos, v, harissis, and, anastasios, v, harissis, posit, a, different, interpretation, of, these, symbols, saying, that, they, were, based, on, apiculture, rather, than, religion, a, major, festival, was, exemplified, in, bull, leaping, represented, in, the, frescoes, of, knossos, and, inscribed, in, miniature, seals, similar, to, other, bronze, age, archaeological, finds, burial, remains, constitute, much, of, the, material, and, archaeological, evidence, for, the, period, by, the, end, of, the, second, palace, period, minoan, burial, was, dominated, by, two, forms, circular, tombs, tholoi, in, southern, crete, and, house, tombs, in, the, north, and, the, east, however, much, minoan, mortuary, practice, does, not, conform, to, this, pattern, burial, was, more, popular, than, cremation, individual, burial, was, the, rule, except, for, the, chrysolakkos, complex, in, malia, here, a, number, of, buildings, form, a, complex, in, the, center, of, mallia, s, burial, area, and, may, have, been, the, focus, for, burial, rituals, or, a, crypt, for, a, notable, family, evidence, of, possible, human, sacrifice, by, the, minoans, has, been, found, at, three, sites, at, anemospilia, in, a, mmii, building, near, mt, juktas, considered, a, temple, an, emii, sanctuary, complex, at, fournou, korifi, in, south, central, crete, and, in, an, lmib, building, known, as, the, north, house, in, knossos, minoan, cities, were, connected, by, narrow, roads, paved, with, blocks, cut, with, bronze, saws, streets, were, drained, and, water, and, sewage, facilities, were, available, to, the, upper, class, through, clay, pipes, minoan, buildings, often, had, flat, tiled, roofs, plaster, wood, or, flagstone, floors, and, stood, two, to, three, stories, high, lower, walls, were, typically, constructed, of, stone, and, rubble, and, the, upper, walls, of, mudbrick, ceiling, timbers, held, up, the, roofs, construction, materials, for, villas, and, palaces, varied, and, included, sandstone, gypsum, and, limestone, building, techniques, also, varied, with, some, palaces, using, ashlar, masonry, and, others, roughly, hewn, megalithic, blocks, in, north, central, crete, blue, greenschist, was, used, to, pave, floors, of, streets, and, courtyards, between, 1650, and, 1600, bc, these, rocks, were, likely, quarried, in, agia, pelagia, on, the, north, coast, of, central, crete, the, minoans, famously, built, large, complexes, referred, to, as, palaces, however, despite, their, name, it, is, generally, agreed, that, they, did, not, primarily, serve, as, royal, residences, the, best, known, of, them, are, at, knossos, phaistos, zakros, and, malia, minoan, palaces, consist, of, wings, arranged, around, an, open, rectangular, court, the, wings, are, often, multi, story, with, interior, and, exterior, staircases, lightwells, massive, columns, and, large, storage, chambers, the, various, palaces, have, a, fairly, uniform, style, though, each, has, unique, features, they, are, typically, aligned, with, their, surrounding, topography, in, particular, with, nearby, sacred, mountains, for, instance, the, palace, at, phaistos, appears, to, align, with, mount, ida, and, knossos, is, aligned, with, mount, juktas, both, on, a, north, south, axis, the, first, palaces, are, generally, dated, to, the, mm, ib, period, however, they, were, not, a, spontaneous, development, but, rather, the, culmination, of, a, longer, architectural, tradition, the, palace, style, has, precedents, in, early, minoan, construction, styles, and, earlier, buildings, were, sometimes, incorporated, in, the, later, palaces, the, palace, at, malia, is, sometimes, regarded, as, having, achieved, palacehood, at, the, end, of, the, early, minoan, period, palaces, were, continually, renovated, and, altered, with, their, style, changing, over, time, for, instance, early, palaces, had, a, square, within, a, square, layout, while, later, renovations, introduced, more, internal, divisions, and, corridors, the, function, of, the, palaces, is, a, matter, of, debate, though, it, is, known, that, they, included, administrative, offices, shrines, workshops, and, storage, spaces, during, the, minoan, era, extensive, waterways, were, built, in, order, to, protect, the, growing, population, this, system, had, two, primary, functions, first, providing, and, distributing, water, and, secondly, relocating, sewage, and, stormwater, one, of, the, defining, aspects, of, the, minoan, era, was, the, architectural, feats, of, their, waste, management, the, minoans, used, technologies, such, as, wells, cisterns, and, aqueducts, to, manage, their, water, supplies, structural, aspects, of, their, buildings, even, played, a, part, flat, roofs, and, plentiful, open, courtyards, were, used, for, collecting, water, to, be, stored, in, cisterns, significantly, the, minoans, had, water, treatment, devices, one, such, device, seems, to, have, been, a, porous, clay, pipe, through, which, water, was, allowed, to, flow, until, clean, for, sustaining, of, the, roof, some, higher, houses, especially, the, palaces, used, columns, made, usually, of, cupressus, sempervirens, and, sometimes, of, stone, one, of, the, most, notable, minoan, contributions, to, architecture, is, their, inverted, column, wider, at, the, top, than, the, base, unlike, most, greek, columns, which, are, wider, at, the, bottom, to, give, an, impression, of, height, the, columns, were, made, of, wood, not, stone, and, were, generally, painted, red, mounted, on, a, simple, stone, base, they, were, topped, with, a, pillow, like, round, capital, a, number, of, compounds, known, as, villas, have, been, excavated, on, crete, mostly, near, palaces, especially, knossos, these, structures, share, features, of, neopalatial, palaces, a, conspicuous, western, facade, storage, facilities, and, a, three, part, minoan, hall, these, features, may, indicate, a, similar, role, or, that, the, structures, were, artistic, imitations, suggesting, that, their, occupants, were, familiar, with, palatial, culture, the, villas, were, often, richly, decorated, as, evidenced, by, the, frescos, of, hagia, triada, villa, a, a, common, characteristic, of, the, minoan, villas, was, having, flat, roofs, their, rooms, did, not, have, windows, to, the, streets, the, light, arriving, from, courtyards, a, common, feature, of, larger, mediterranean, in, much, later, periods, in, the, 2nd, millennium, bc, the, villas, had, one, or, two, floors, and, the, palaces, even, three, early, excavators, such, as, arthur, evans, proposed, that, there, was, little, internal, armed, conflict, in, minoan, crete, until, the, mycenaean, period, however, subsequent, scholarship, has, questioned, this, interpretation, no, evidence, has, been, found, of, a, minoan, army, or, the, minoan, domination, of, peoples, beyond, crete, evans, believed, that, the, minoans, had, some, kind, of, overlordship, of, at, least, parts, of, mycenaean, greece, in, the, neopalatial, period, but, it, is, now, very, widely, agreed, that, the, opposite, was, the, case, with, a, mycenaean, elite, clearly, ruling, knossos, from, around, 1450, bc, few, signs, of, warfare, appear, in, minoan, art, although, a, few, archaeologists, see, war, scenes, in, a, few, pieces, of, minoan, art, others, interpret, even, these, scenes, as, festivals, sacred, dance, or, sports, events, studebaker, 2004, p, 27, although, armed, warriors, are, depicted, as, stabbed, in, the, throat, with, swords, the, violence, may, be, part, of, a, ritual, or, blood, sport, nanno, marinatos, argued, that, the, neopalatial, minoans, had, a, powerful, navy, that, made, them, a, desirable, ally, to, have, in, mediterranean, power, politics, at, least, by, the, 14th, century, as, vassals, of, the, pharaoh, leading, cretan, tribute, bearers, to, be, depicted, on, egyptian, tombs, such, as, those, of, the, top, officials, rekmire, and, senmut, on, mainland, greece, during, the, shaft, grave, era, at, mycenae, there, is, little, evidence, for, major, mycenaean, fortifications, the, citadels, follow, the, destruction, of, nearly, all, neopalatial, cretan, sites, warfare, by, other, contemporaries, of, the, ancient, minoans, such, as, the, egyptians, and, the, hittites, is, well, documented, despite, finding, ruined, watchtowers, and, fortification, walls, evans, said, that, there, was, little, evidence, of, ancient, minoan, fortifications, according, to, stylianos, alexiou, in, kretologia, 8, a, number, of, sites, especially, early, and, middle, minoan, sites, such, as, aghia, photia, are, built, on, hilltops, or, otherwise, fortified, lucia, nixon, wrote, we, may, have, been, over, influenced, by, the, lack, of, what, we, might, think, of, as, solid, fortifications, to, assess, the, archaeological, evidence, properly, as, in, so, many, other, instances, we, may, not, have, been, looking, for, evidence, in, the, right, places, and, therefore, we, may, not, end, with, a, correct, assessment, of, the, minoans, and, their, ability, to, avoid, war, chester, starr, said, in, minoan, flower, lovers, that, since, shang, china, and, the, maya, had, unfortified, centers, and, engaged, in, frontier, struggles, a, lack, of, fortifications, alone, does, not, prove, that, the, minoans, were, a, peaceful, civilization, unparalleled, in, history, in, 1998, when, minoan, archaeologists, met, in, a, belgian, conference, to, discuss, the, possibility, that, the, pax, minoica, was, outdated, evidence, of, minoan, war, was, still, scanty, according, to, jan, driessen, the, minoans, frequently, depicted, weapons, in, their, art, in, a, ritual, context, the, construction, of, fortified, sites, is, often, assumed, to, reflect, a, threat, of, warfare, but, such, fortified, centres, were, multifunctional, they, were, also, often, the, embodiment, or, material, expression, of, the, central, places, of, the, territories, at, the, same, time, as, being, monuments, glorifying, and, merging, leading, power, stella, chryssoulaki, s, work, on, small, outposts, or, guardhouses, in, eastern, crete, indicates, a, possible, defensive, system, type, a, high, quality, minoan, swords, were, found, in, the, palaces, of, mallia, and, zarkos, see, sanders, aja, 65, 67, hoeckmann, jrgzm, 27, or, rehak, and, younger, aja, 102, keith, branigan, estimated, that, 95, percent, of, minoan, weapons, had, hafting, hilts, or, handles, which, would, have, prevented, their, use, as, such, however, tests, of, replicas, indicated, that, the, weapons, could, cut, flesh, down, to, the, bone, and, score, the, bone, s, surface, without, damaging, the, weapons, themselves, according, to, paul, rehak, minoan, figure, eight, shields, could, not, have, been, used, for, fighting, or, hunting, since, they, were, too, cumbersome, although, cheryl, floyd, concluded, that, minoan, weapons, were, tools, used, for, mundane, tasks, such, as, meat, processing, middle, minoan, rapiers, nearly, three, feet, in, length, have, been, found, charles, gates, argues, that, the, absence, of, warfare, in, minoan, art, does, not, prove, it, did, not, occur, because, there, is, no, correlation, between, a, society, s, artistic, depiction, of, warfare, and, how, often, said, society, is, involved, in, conflict, barry, molloy, states, that, artwork, is, an, unreliable, guide, to, a, society, s, behaviour, using, the, example, that, frescoes, recovered, prior, to, the, late, minoan, period, seldom, depict, people, interacting, with, each, other, yet, this, should, not, be, taken, as, evidence, that, minoans, rarely, did, so, molloy, further, argues, that, the, lack, of, fortifications, could, be, attributed, to, crete, s, rugged, topography, which, would, have, provided, a, significant, natural, defensive, advantage, molloy, argues, that, the, guardhouses, could, have, been, used, to, secure, narrow, roads, through, crete, about, minoan, warfare, branigan, concluded, the, quantity, of, weaponry, the, impressive, fortifications, and, the, aggressive, looking, long, boats, all, suggested, an, era, of, intensified, hostilities, but, on, closer, inspection, there, are, grounds, for, thinking, that, all, three, key, elements, are, bound, up, as, much, with, status, statements, display, and, fashion, as, with, aggression, warfare, such, as, there, was, in, the, southern, aegean, early, bronze, age, was, either, personalized, and, perhaps, ritualized, in, crete, or, small, scale, intermittent, and, essentially, an, economic, activity, in, the, cyclades, and, the, argolid, attica, archaeologist, olga, krzyszkowska, agreed, the, stark, fact, is, that, for, the, prehistoric, aegean, we, have, no, direct, evidence, for, war, and, warfare, per, se, a, cephalometric, analysis, by, argyropoulos, et, al, 1989, published, in, the, angle, orthodontist, showed, remarkable, similarity, in, craniofacial, morphology, between, minoans, and, modern, greeks, suggesting, a, close, affinity, and, that, the, greek, ethnic, group, remained, stable, in, its, cephalic, and, facial, morphology, for, the, last, 4, 000, years, a, craniofacial, morphological, study, by, papagrigorakis, et, al, 2014, published, in, anthropologischer, anzeiger, also, indicated, craniological, similarities, between, modern, greeks, and, minoans, indicating, continuity, a, 2013, archaeogenetics, study, by, hughey, at, al, published, in, nature, communications, compared, skeletal, mtdna, from, ancient, minoan, skeletons, that, were, sealed, in, a, cave, in, the, lasithi, plateau, between, 3, 700, and, 4, 400, years, ago, to, 135, samples, from, greece, anatolia, western, and, northern, europe, north, africa, and, egypt, the, researchers, found, that, the, minoan, skeletons, were, genetically, very, similar, to, modern, day, europeans, and, especially, close, to, modern, day, cretans, particularly, those, from, the, lasithi, plateau, they, were, also, genetically, similar, to, neolithic, europeans, but, distinct, from, egyptian, or, libyan, populations, we, now, know, that, the, founders, of, the, first, advanced, european, civilization, were, european, said, study, co, author, george, stamatoyannopoulos, a, human, geneticist, at, the, university, of, washington, they, were, very, similar, to, neolithic, europeans, and, very, similar, to, present, day, cretans, in, their, archaeogenetic, study, published, in, nature, lazaridis, et, al, 2017, found, that, minoans, and, mycenaean, greeks, were, genetically, highly, similar, but, not, identical, and, that, modern, greeks, descend, from, these, populations, the, f, st, between, the, sampled, bronze, age, populations, and, present, day, west, eurasians, was, estimated, finding, that, mycenaean, greeks, and, minoans, were, least, differentiated, from, the, populations, of, modern, greece, cyprus, albania, and, italy, in, a, subsequent, study, lazaridis, et, al, 2022, concluded, that, around, 58, 4, 65, 8, of, the, dna, of, the, mycenaeans, and, 70, 9, 76, 7, of, the, minoans, came, from, early, european, farmers, eef, while, the, remainder, came, from, ancient, populations, related, to, the, caucasus, hunter, gatherers, chg, mycenaeans, 20, 1, 22, 7, minoans, 17, 19, 4, and, the, pre, pottery, neolithic, ppn, culture, mycenaeans, 7, 14, minoans, 3, 9, 9, 5, unlike, the, minoans, the, mycenaeans, had, also, inherited, 3, 3, 5, 5, ancestry, on, average, from, a, source, related, to, the, eastern, european, hunter, gatherers, ehg, introduced, via, a, proximal, source, related, to, the, inhabitants, of, the, pontic, caspian, steppe, western, steppe, herders, who, are, hypothesized, to, be, the, proto, indo, europeans, and, 0, 9, 2, 3, from, the, iron, gates, hunter, gatherers, in, the, balkans, in, 2023, whole, genome, wide, data, of, 102, individuals, from, crete, the, greek, mainland, and, aegean, islands, were, sequenced, spanning, from, the, neolithic, to, iron, age, it, was, discovered, that, the, early, farmers, from, crete, shared, the, same, ancestry, as, other, neolithic, aegeans, it, also, confirmed, previous, findings, for, additional, central, eastern, european, ancestry, in, the, greek, mainland, by, the, middle, bronze, age, a, multidisciplinary, report, in, 2024, also, included, a, bioarcheological, investigation, conducted, on, remains, that, were, found, in, armenoi, crete, the, research, revealed, that, the, dna, of, 23, newly, sequenced, individuals, from, late, minoan, tombs, had, derived, most, of, their, ancestry, from, an, anatolian, neolithic, source, modern, greeks, share, this, genetic, profile, but, are, more, shifted, towards, the, yamnaya, on, the, pca, and, differentiated, from, the, greek, populations, that, lived, during, the, early, bronze, age, the, admixture, analysis, identified, three, main, reference, components, anatolian, neolithic, iranian, neolithic, and, western, hunter, gatherer, with, the, minoans, also, having, some, yamnaya, related, ancestry, the, majority, of, individuals, in, the, necropolis, formed, a, homogenous, population, with, the, exception, of, one, individual, who, was, more, similar, to, the, populations, of, western, europe, overall, the, studied, genomes, were, found, to, be, most, similar, to, the, other, published, genomes, of, myceneans, from, mainland, greece, however, on, the, pca, analysis, they, plot, exactly, in, between, both, minoans, and, myceneans, the, researchers, noted, that, based, on, their, genomic, profile, and, placement, they, may, have, been, a, mix, of, both, groups
