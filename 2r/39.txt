much, to, the, surprise, of, the, scientific, community, this, newly, discovered, hominid, was, named, the, flores, man, or, homo, floresiensis, a, phylogenetic, analysis, published, in, 2017, suggests, that, h, floresiensis, was, descended, from, the, same, ancestor, as, homo, habilis, h, floresiensis, would, thus, represent, a, previously, unknown, and, very, early, migration, out, of, africa, the, homo, floresiensis, skeletal, material, is, dated, from, 60, 000, to, 100, 000, years, ago, stone, tools, recovered, alongside, the, skeletal, remains, were, from, archaeological,

islands, and, destroyed, neighbouring, kingdoms, their, focus, seems, to, have, been, on, controlling, and, gaining, a, larger, share, of, the, commercial, trade, that, passed, through, the, archipelago, about, the, time, majapahit, was, founded, muslim, traders, and, proselytisers, began, entering, the, area, after, its, peak, in, the, 14th, century, majapahit, power, began, to, decline, and, was, unable, to, control, the, rising, power, of, the, sultanate, of, malacca, dates, for, the, end, of, the, majapahit, empire, range, from, 1478, to, 1520, a, large, number, of, courtiers,

from, the, abbasid, caliphate, according, to, those, early, accounts, the, indonesian, archipelago, were, famous, among, early, muslim, sailors, mainly, due, to, its, abundance, of, precious, spice, trade, commodities, such, as, nutmeg, cloves, galangal, and, many, other, spices, although, muslim, traders, first, travelled, through, south, east, asia, early, in, the, islamic, era, the, spread, of, islam, among, the, inhabitants, of, the, indonesian, archipelago, dates, to, the, 13th, century, in, northern, sumatra, although, it, is, known, that, the, spread, of, islam, began, in, the, west, of, the, archipelago, the, fragmentary, evidence, does, not, suggest, a, rolling, wave, of, conversion, through, adjacent, areas, rather, it, suggests, the, process, was, complicated, and, slow, the, spread, of, islam, was, driven, by, increasing, trade, links, outside, of, the, archipelago, in, general, traders, and, the, royalty, of, major, kingdoms, were, the, first, to, adopt, the, new,

hindu, majority, in, the, eastern, archipelago, both, christian, and, islamic, missionaries, were, active, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, and, currently, there, are, large, communities, of, both, religions, on, these, islands, the, sultanate, of, mataram, was, the, third, sultanate, in, java, after, the, sultanate, of, demak, bintoro, and, the, sultanate, of, pajang, according, to, javanese, records, kyai, gedhe, pamanahan, became, the, ruler, of, the, mataram, area, in, the, 1570s, with, the, support, of, the, kingdom, of, pajang, to, the, east, near, the, current, site, of, surakarta, solo, pamanahan, was, often, referred, to, as, kyai, gedhe, mataram, after, his, ascension, pamanahan, s, son, panembahan, senapati, replaced, his, father, on, the, throne, around, 1584, under, senapati, the, kingdom, grew, substantially, through, regular, military, campaigns, against, mataram, s, neighbours, shortly, after, his, accession, for, example, he, conquered, his, father, s, patrons, in, pajang, the, reign, of, panembahan, seda, ing, krapyak, suhusunan, anyakrawati, c, 1601, 1613, the, son, of, senapati, was, dominated, by, further, warfare, especially, against, powerful, surabaya, already, a, major, centre, in, east, java, the, first, contact, between, mataram, and, the, dutch, east, india, company, voc, occurred, under, krapyak, dutch, activities, at, the, time, were, limited, to, trading, from, limited, coastal, settlements, so, their, interactions, with, the, inland, mataram, kingdom, were, limited, although, they, did, form, an, alliance, against, surabaya, in, 1613, krapyak, died, that, year, krapyak, was, succeeded, by, his, son, who, is, known, simply, as, sultan, agung, great, sultan, in, javanese, records, agung, was, responsible, for, the, great, expansion, and, lasting, historical, legacy, of, mataram, due, to, the, extensive, military, conquests, of, his, long, reign, from, 1613, to, 1646, in, 1524, 25, sunan, gunung, jati, from, cirebon, together, with, the, armies, of, demak, sultanate, seized, the, port, of, banten, from, the, sunda, kingdom, and, established, the, sultanate, of, banten, this, was, accompanied, by, muslim, preachers, and, the, adoption, of, islam, amongst, the, local, population, at, its, peak, in, the, first, half, of, the, 17th, century, the, sultanate, lasted, from, 1526, to, 1813, ad, the, sultanate, left, many, archaeological, remains, and, historical, records, beginning, in, the, 16th, century, successive, waves, of, europeans, the, portuguese, spanish, dutch, and, english, sought, to, dominate, the, spice, trade, at, its, sources, in, india, and, the, spice, islands, maluku, of, indonesia, this, meant, finding, a, way, to, asia, to, cut, out, muslim, merchants, who, with, their, venetian, outlet, in, the, mediterranean, monopolised, spice, imports, to, europe, astronomically, priced, at, the, time, spices, were, highly, coveted, not, only, to, preserve, and, make, poorly, preserved, meat, palatable, but, also, as, medicines, and, magic, potions, the, arrival, of, europeans, in, south, east, asia, is, often, regarded, as, the, watershed, moment, in, its, history, other, scholars, consider, this, view, untenable, arguing, that, european, influence, during, the, times, of, the, early, arrivals, of, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, was, limited, in, both, area, and, depth, this, is, in, part, due, to, europe, not, being, the, most, advanced, or, dynamic, area, of, the, world, in, the, early, 15th, century, rather, the, major, expansionist, force, of, this, time, was, islam, in, 1453, for, example, the, ottoman, turks, conquered, constantinople, while, islam, continued, to, spread, through, indonesia, and, the, philippines, european, influence, particularly, that, of, the, dutch, would, not, have, its, greatest, impact, on, indonesia, until, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, newfound, portuguese, expertise, in, navigation, shipbuilding, and, weaponry, allowed, them, to, make, daring, expeditions, of, exploration, and, expansion, starting, with, the, first, exploratory, expeditions, sent, from, newly, conquered, malacca, in, 1512, the, portuguese, were, the, first, europeans, to, arrive, in, indonesia, and, sought, to, dominate, the, sources, of, valuable, spices, and, to, extend, the, catholic, church, s, missionary, efforts, the, portuguese, turned, east, to, maluku, and, through, both, military, conquest, and, alliance, with, local, rulers, they, established, trading, posts, forts, and, missions, on, the, islands, of, ternate, ambon, and, solor, among, others, the, height, of, portuguese, missionary, activities, however, came, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 16th, century, ultimately, the, portuguese, presence, in, indonesia, was, reduced, to, solor, flores, and, timor, in, modern, day, nusa, tenggara, following, defeat, at, the, hands, of, indigenous, ternateans, and, the, dutch, in, maluku, and, a, general, failure, to, maintain, control, of, trade, in, the, region, in, comparison, with, the, original, portuguese, ambition, to, dominate, asian, trade, their, influence, on, indonesian, culture, was, small, the, romantic, keroncong, guitar, ballads, a, number, of, indonesian, words, which, reflect, portuguese, s, role, as, the, lingua, franca, of, the, archipelago, alongside, malay, and, many, family, names, in, eastern, indonesia, such, as, da, costa, dias, de, fretes, gonsalves, etc, the, most, significant, impacts, of, the, portuguese, arrival, were, the, disruption, and, disorganisation, of, the, trade, network, mostly, as, a, result, of, their, conquest, of, malacca, and, the, first, significant, plantings, of, christianity, in, indonesia, there, have, continued, to, be, christian, communities, in, eastern, indonesia, through, to, the, present, which, has, contributed, to, a, sense, of, shared, interest, with, europeans, particularly, among, the, ambonese, in, 1602, the, dutch, parliament, awarded, the, voc, a, monopoly, on, trade, and, colonial, activities, in, the, region, at, a, time, before, the, company, controlled, any, territory, in, java, in, 1619,

much, more, success, than, the, previous, portuguese, efforts, they, exploited, the, factionalisation, of, the, small, kingdoms, in, java, that, had, replaced, majapahit, establishing, a, permanent, foothold, in, java, from, which, grew, a, land, based, colonial, empire, which, became, one, of, the, richest, colonial, possessions, on, earth, by, the, mid, 17th, century, batavia, the, headquarter,

also, brought, under, voc, control, and, the, last, of, the, portuguese, were, expelled, in, 1660, in, return, for, monopoly, control, over, the, pepper, trade, and, the, expulsion, of, the, english,
