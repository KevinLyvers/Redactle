days, members, of, the, tutsi, minority, ethnic, group, as, well, as, some, moderate, hutu, and, twa, were, killed, by, armed, hutu, militias, although, the, constitution, of, rwanda, states, that, more, than, 1, million, people, perished, in, the, genocide, the, demographic, evidence, suggests, that, the, real, number, killed, was, likely, lower, the, most, widely, accepted, scholarly, estimates, are, around, 500, 000, to, 662, 000, tutsi, deaths, in, 1990, the, rwandan, patriotic, front, rpf, a, rebel, group, composed, mostly, of, tutsi, refugees, invaded, northern, rwanda, from, their, base, in, uganda, initiating, the, rwandan, civil, war, over, the, course, of, the, next, three, years, neither, side, was, able, to, gain, a, decisive, advantage, in, an, effort, to, bring, the, war, to, a, peaceful, end, the, rwandan, government, led, by, hutu, president, juv, nal, habyarimana, signed, the, arusha, accords, with, the, rpf, on, 4, august, 1993, the, catalyst, became, habyarimana, s, assassination, on, 6, april, 1994, creating, a, power, vacuum, and, ending, peace, accords, genocidal, killings, began, the, following, day, when, majority, hutu, soldiers, police, and, militia, murdered, key, tutsi, and, moderate, hutu, military, and, political, leaders, the, scale, and, brutality, of, the, genocide, caused, shock, worldwide, but, no, country, intervened, to, forcefully, stop, the, killings, most, of, the, victims, were, killed, in, their, own, villages, or, towns, many, by, their, neighbors, and, fellow, villagers, hutu, gangs, searched, out, victims, hiding, in, churches, and, school, buildings, the, militia, murdered, victims, with, machetes, and, rifles, sexual, violence, was, rife, with, an, estimated, 250, 000, to, 500, 000, women, raped,

g, nocidaires, into, zaire, now, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, the, genocide, had, lasting, and, profound, effects, in, 1996, the, rpf, led, rwandan, government, launched, an, offensive, into, zaire, home, to, exiled, leaders, of, the, former, rwandan, government, and, many, hutu, refugees, starting, the, first, congo, war, and, killing, an, estimated, 200, 000, people, today, rwanda, has, two, public, holidays, to, mourn, the, genocide, and, genocide, ideology, and, divisionism, are, criminal, offences, the, earliest, inhabitants, of, what, is, now, rwanda, were, the, twa, a, group, of, aboriginal, pygmy, hunter, gatherers, who, settled, in, the, area, between, 8000, bc, and, 3000, bc, and, remain, in, rwanda, today, between, 700, bc, and, 1500, ad, a, number, of, bantu, groups, migrated, into, rwanda, and, began, to, clear, forest, land, for, agriculture, historians, have, several, theories, regarding, the, nature, of, the, bantu, migrations, one, theory, is, that, the, first, settlers, were, hutu, while, the, tutsi, migrated, later, and, formed, a, distinct, racial, group, possibly, of, cushitic, origin, an, alternative, theory, is, that, the, migration, was, slow, and, steady, from, neighbouring, regions, with, incoming, groups, bearing, high, genetic, similarity, to, the, established, ones, and, integrating, into, rather, than, conquering, the, existing, society, under, this, theory, the, hutu, and, tutsi, distinction, arose, later, and, was, not, a, racial, one, but, principally, a, class, or, caste, distinction, in, which, the, tutsi, herded, cattle, while, the, hutu, farmed, the, land, the, hutu, tutsi, and, twa, of, rwanda, share, a, common, language, and, are, collectively, known, as, the, banyarwanda, the, population, coalesced, first, into, clans, ubwoko, and, then, by, 1700, into, around, eight, kingdoms, the, kingdom, of, rwanda, ruled, by, the, tutsi, nyiginya, clan, became, the, dominant, kingdom, from, the, mid, eighteenth, century, expanding, through, a, process, of, conquest, and, assimilation, and, achieving, its, greatest, extent, under, the, reign, of, king, kigeli, rwabugiri, in, 1853, 1895, rwabugiri, expanded, the, kingdom, west, and, north, and, initiated, administrative, reforms, which, caused, a, rift, to, grow, between, the, hutu, and, tutsi, populations, these, included, uburetwa, a, system, of, forced, labour, which, hutu, had, to, perform, to, regain, access, to, land, seized, from, them, and, ubuhake, under, which, tutsi, patrons, ceded, cattle, to, hutu, or, tutsi, clients, in, exchange, for, economic, and, personal, service, although, hutu, and, tutsi, were, often, treated, differently, they, shared, the, same, language, and, culture, the, same, clan, names, and, the, same, customs, the, symbols, of, kinship, served, as, a, unifying, bond, between, them, 421, rwanda, and, neighbouring, burundi, were, assigned, to, germany, by, the, berlin, conference, of, 1884, and, germany, established, a, presence, in, the, country, in, 1897, with, the, formation, of, an, alliance, with, the, king, german, policy, was, to, rule, the, country, through, the, rwandan, monarchy, this, system, had, the, added, benefit, of, enabling, colonization, with, small, european, troop, numbers, the, colonists, favoured, the, tutsi, over, the, hutu, when, assigning, administrative, roles, believing, them, to, be, migrants, from, ethiopia, and, racially, superior, the, rwandan, king, welcomed, the, germans, using, their, military, strength, to, widen, his, rule, belgian, forces, took, control, of, rwanda, and, burundi, in, 1917, during, world, war, i, and, from, 1926, began, a, policy, of, more, direct, colonial, rule, the, belgians, modernised, the, rwandan, economy, but, tutsi, supremacy, remained, leaving, the, hutu, disenfranchised, in, the, early, 1930s, belgium, introduced, a, permanent, division, of, the, population, by, classifying, rwandans, into, three, ethnic, ethno, racial, groups, with, the, hutu, representing, about, 84, of, the, population, the, tutsi, about, 15, and, the, twa, about, 1, compulsory, identity, cards, were, issued, labeling, under, the, heading, for, ethnicity, and, race, each, individual, as, either, tutsi, hutu, twa, or, naturalised, while, it, had, previously, been, possible, for, particularly, wealthy, hutus, to, become, honorary, tutsis, the, identity, cards, prevented, any, further, movement, between, the, groups, and, made, socio, economic, groups, into, rigid, ethnic, groups, the, ethnic, identities, of, the, hutu, and, tutsi, were, reshaped, and, mythologized, by, the, colonizers, christian, missionaries, in, rwanda, promoted, the, theory, about, the, hamitic, origins, of, the, kingdom, and, referred, to, the, distinctively, ethiopian, features, and, hence, foreign, origins, of, the, tutsi, caste, these, mythologies, provide, the, basis, for, anti, tutsi, propaganda, in, 1994, 421, starkly, contrasted, the, tutsi, origin, myth, holds, that, kanyarwanda, had, several, sons, including, gatutsi, and, gahutu, ancestors, of, the, tutsi, and, hutu, who, are, therefore, brothers, the, hutu, origin, myth, holds, that, kigwa, patrilineal, ancestor, of, ruhanga, and, the, first, tutsi, fell, from, the, sky, on, an, earth, inhabited, by, hutu, 65, after, world, war, ii, a, hutu, emancipation, movement, began, to, grow, in, rwanda, fuelled, by, increasing, resentment, of, the, inter, war, social, reforms, and, also, an, increasing, sympathy, for, the, hutu, within, the, catholic, church, catholic, missionaries, increasingly, viewed, themselves, as, responsible, for, empowering, the, underprivileged, hutu, rather, than, the, tutsi, elite, leading, rapidly, to, the, formation, of, a, sizeable, hutu, clergy, and, educated, elite, that, provided, a, new, counterbalance, to, the, established, political, order, the, monarchy, and, prominent, tutsis, sensed, the, growing, influence, of, the, hutu, and, began, to, agitate, for, immediate, independence, on, their, own, terms, in, 1957, a, group, of, hutu, scholars, wrote, the, bahutu, manifesto, this, was, the, first, document, to, label, the, tutsi, and, hutu, as, separate, races, and, called, for, the, transfer, of, power, from, tutsi, to, hutu, based, on, what, it, termed, statistical, law, on, 1, november, 1959, dominique, mbonyumutwa, a, hutu, sub, chief, was, attacked, close, to, his, home, in, byimana, gitarama, prefecture, by, supporters, of, the, pro, tutsi, party, mbonyumutwa, survived, but, rumours, began, spreading, that, he, had, been, killed, hutu, activists, responded, by, killing, tutsis, both, the, elite, and, ordinary, civilians, marking, the, beginning, of, the, rwandan, revolution, the, tutsi, responded, with, attacks, of, their, own, but, by, this, stage, the, hutu, had, full, backing, from, the, belgian, administration, who, wanted, to, overturn, the, tutsi, domination, in, early, 1960, the, belgians, replaced, most, tutsi, chiefs, with, hutu, and, organised, mid, year, commune, elections, which, returned, an, overwhelming, hutu, majority, the, king, was, deposed, a, hutu, dominated, republic, created, and, the, country, became, independent, in, 1962, as, the, revolution, progressed, tutsis, began, leaving, the, country, to, escape, the, hutu, purges, settling, in, the, four, neighbouring, countries, burundi, uganda, tanzania, and, zaire, these, exiles, unlike, the, banyarwanda, who, migrated, during, the, pre, colonial, and, colonial, era, were, regarded, as, refugees, in, their, host, countries, and, began, almost, immediately, to, agitate, for, a, return, to, rwanda, they, formed, armed, groups, who, launched, attacks, into, rwanda, these, were, largely, unsuccessful, and, led, to, further, reprisal, killings, of, 10, 000, tutsis, and, further, tutsi, exiles, by, 1964, more, than, 300, 000, tutsis, had, fled, and, were, forced, to, remain, in, exile,

he, was, overthrown, following, a, coup, in, 1973, which, brought, president, juv, nal, habyarimana, to, power, pro, hutu, and, anti, tutsi, discrimination, continued, in, rwanda, itself, although, the, indiscriminate, violence, against, the, tutsi, did, decrease, somewhat, habyarimana, founded, the, national, republican, movement, for, democracy, and, development, mrnd, party, in, 1975, and, promulgated, a, new, constitution, following, a, 1978, referendum, making, the, country, a, one, party, state, in, which, every, citizen, had, to, belong, to, the, mrnd, at, 408, inhabitants, per,

in, 1989, leading, to, competition, for, land, historians, such, as, g, rard, prunier, believe, that, the, 1994, genocide, can, be, partly, attributed, to, population, density, in, the, 1980s, a, group, of, 500, rwandan, refugees, in, uganda, led, by, fred, rwigyema, fought, with, the, rebel, national, resistance, army, nra, in, the, ugandan, bush, war, which, saw, yoweri, museveni, overthrow,

of, the, republic, cdr, party, which, was, linked, to, the, ruling, party, but, more, right, wing, and, promoted, an, agenda, critical, of, the, president, s, alleged, softness, with, the, rpf, to,

people, when, the, rpf, resumed, hostilities, in, february, 1993, it, cited, these, killings, as, the, primary, motive, but, its, effect, was, to, increase, support, for, the, extremists, amongst,

habyarimana, continues, to, be, debated, by, historians, prosecutors, at, the, ictr, argued, but, were, unable, to, prove, that, the, defendants, planned, the, genocide, prior, to, habyarimana, s, assassination, in, 1990, the, army, began, arming, civilians, with, weapons, such, as, machetes, and, it, began, training, the, hutu, youth, in, combat, officially, as, a, programme, of, civil, defence, against, the, rpf, threat, but, these, weapons, were, later, used, to, carry, out, the, genocide, in, particular, the, hutu, power, leaders, organized, a, paramilitary, or, militia, force,

the, start, of, the, genocide, approached, the, rtlm, broadcasts, focused, on, anti, tutsi, propaganda, they, characterized, the, tutsi, as, a, dangerous, enemy, who, wanted, to, seize, the, political, power, at, the, expense, of, hutus, by, linking, the, rwandan, patriotic, army, with, the, tutsi, political, party, and, ordinary, tutsi, citizens, they, classified, the, entire, ethnic, group, as, one, homogeneous, threat, to, rwandans, the, rtlm, went, further, than, amplifying, ethnic, and, political, division, it, also, labeled, the, tutsi, as, inyenzi, meaning, non, human, pests, or, cockroaches, which, must, be, exterminated, leading, up, to, the, genocide, there, were, 294, instances, of, the, rtlm, accusing, the, rwandan, patriotic, army, of, atrocities, against, the, hutu, along, with, 252, broadcasts, that, call, for, hutus, to, kill, the, tutsis, one, such, broadcast, stated, someone, must, make, them, disappear, for, good, to, wipe, them, from, human, memory, to,

related, to, their, incitement, to, genocide, a, 2014, study, by, harvard, kennedy, school, researcher, david, yanagizawa, drott, found, that, approximately, 10, of, the, overall, violence, during, the, rwandan, genocide, can, be, attributed, to, this, new, radio, station, gordon, danning, a, researcher, with, the, free, speech, advocacy, group, foundation, for, individual, rights, in, education, questioned, the, assumption, of, that, paper, that, media, availability, correlated, with, media, consumption, during, 1993, the, hardliners, imported, machetes, on, a, scale, far, larger, than, what, was, required, for, agriculture, as, well, as, other, tools, which, could, be, used, as, weapons, such, as, razor, blades, saws, and, scissors, these, tools, were, distributed, around, the, country, ostensibly, as, part, of, the, civil, defence, network, in, october, 1993, the, president, of, burundi, melchior, ndadaye, who, had, been, elected, in, june, as, the, country, s, first, ever, hutu, president, was, assassinated, by, extremist, tutsi, army, officers, the, assassination, sparked, the, burundi, civil, war, between, burundi, s, hutu, and, tutsi, and, the, burundi, genocide, with, 50, 000, to, 100, 000, people, killed, in, the, first, year, of, war, the, assassination, caused, shockwaves, reinforcing, the, notion, among, hutus, that, the, tutsi, were, their, enemy, and, could, not, be, trusted, the, cdr, and, the, power, wings, of, the, other, parties, realised, they, could, use, this, situation, to, their, advantage, the, idea, of, a, deliberate, and, systematic, genocide, which, had, first, been, suggested, in, 1992, but, had, remained, a, fringe, viewpoint, was, now, top, of, their, agenda, and, they, began, actively, planning, it, they, were, confident, of, persuading, the, hutu, population, to, carry, out, killings, given, the, public, anger, at, ndadaye, s, murder, as, well, as, rtlm, propaganda, and, the, traditional, obedience, of, rwandans, to, authority, the, power, leaders, began, arming, the, interahamwe, and, other, militia, groups, with, ak, 47s, and, other, weapons, previously, they, had, possessed, only, machetes, and,

to, systematically, identify, and, kill, tutsi, they, also, recruited, and, pressured, hutu, civilians, to, arm, themselves, with, machetes, clubs, blunt, objects, and, other, weapons, and, encouraged, them, to, rape, maim, and, kill, their, tutsi, neighbors, and, to, destroy, or, steal, their, property, the, rpf, restarted, its, offensive, soon, after, habyarimana, s, assassination, it, rapidly, seized, control, of, the, northern, part, of, the, country, and, captured, kigali, about, 100, days, later, in, mid, july, bringing, an, end, to, the, genocide, during, these, events, and, in, the, aftermath, the, united, nations, un, and, countries, including, the, united, states, the, united, kingdom, and, belgium, were, criticized, for, their, inaction, and, failure, to, strengthen,

armed, during, the, preceding, months, and, maintained, the, rwandan, tradition, of, obedience, to, authority, carried, out, the, orders, without, question, on, the, other, hand, there, are, views, that, the, genocide, was, not, sudden, irresistible, or, uniformly, orchestrated, but, a, cascade, of, tipping, points, and, each, tipping, point, was, the, outcome, of, local, intra, ethnic, contests, for, dominance, among, hutu, the, protracted, struggles, for, supremacy, in, local, communes, meant, that, a, more, determined, stance, from, the, international, community, would, likely, have, prevented, the, worst, from, happening, in, kigali, the, genocide, was, led, by, the, presidential, guard, the, elite, unit, of, the, army, they, were, assisted, by, the, interahamwe, and, impuzamugambi, who, set, up, roadblocks, throughout, the, capital, each, person, passing, the, roadblock, was, required, to, show, the, national, identity, card, which, included, ethnicity, and, any,

kigali, ville, played, a, leading, role, touring, the, roadblocks, to, ensure, their, effectiveness, and, using, his, position, at, the, top, of, the, kigali, provincial, government, to, disseminate, orders, and, dismiss, officials, who, were, not, sufficiently, active, in, the, killings, in, rural, areas, the, local, government, hierarchy, was, also, in, most, cases, the, chain, of, command, for, the, execution, of, the, genocide, the, prefect, of, each, prefecture, acting, on, orders, from, kigali, disseminated, instructions, to, the, commune, leaders, bourgmestres, who, in, turn, issued, directions, to, the, leaders, of, the, sectors, cells, and, villages, within, their, communes, the, majority, of, the, actual, killings, in, the, countryside, were, carried, out, by, ordinary, civilians, under, orders, from, the, leaders, tutsi, and, hutu, lived, side, by, side, in, their, villages, and, families, all, knew, each, other, making, it, easy, for, hutu, to, identify, and, target, their, tutsi, neighbours, gerard, prunier, ascribes, this, mass, complicity, of, the, population, to, a, combination, of, the, democratic, majority, ideology, in, which, hutu, had, been, taught, to, regard, tutsi, as, dangerous, enemies, the, culture, of, unbending, obedience, to, authority, and, the, duress, factor, villagers, who, refused, to, carry, out, orders, to, kill, were, often, branded, as, tutsi, sympathisers, and, they, themselves, killed, there, were, few, killings, in, the, prefectures, of, gitarama, and, butare, during, the, early, phase, as, the, prefects, of, those, areas, were, moderates, opposed, to, the, violence, the, genocide, began, in, gitarama, after, the, interim, government, relocated, to, the, prefecture, on, 12, april, butare, was, ruled, by, the, only, tutsi, prefect, in, the, country, jean, baptiste, habyalimana, habyalimana, refused, to, authorise, any, killings, in, his, territory, and, for, a, while, butare, became, a, sanctuary, for, tutsi, refugees, from, elsewhere, in, the, country, this, lasted, until, 18, april, when, the, interim, government, dismissed, him, from, his, post, and, replaced, him, with, government, loyalist, sylvain, nsabimana, the, crisis, committee, appointed, an, interim, government, on, 8, april, using, the, terms, of, the, 1991, constitution, instead, of, the, arusha, accords, the, committee, designated, th, odore, sindikubwabo, as, interim, president, of, rwanda, while, jean, kambanda, was, the, new, prime, minister, all, political, parties, were, represented, in, the, government, but, most, members, were, from, the, hutu, power, wings, of, their, respective, parties, the, interim, government, was, sworn, in, on, 9, april, but, relocated, from, kigali, to, gitarama, on, 12, april, ostensibly, fleeing, rpf, s, advance, on, the, capital, the, crisis, committee, was, officially, dissolved, but, bagosora, and, the, senior, officers, remained, the, de, facto, rulers, of, the, country, the, government, played, its, part, in, mobilising, the, population, giving, the, regime, an, air, of, legitimacy, but, was, effectively, a, puppet, regime, with, no, ability, to, halt, the, army, or, the, interahamwe, s, activities, when, rom, o, dallaire, visited, the, government, s, headquarters, a, week, after, its, formation, he, found, most, officials, at, leisure, describing, their, activities, as, sorting, out, the, seating, plan, for, a, meeting, that, was, not, about, to, convene, any, time, soon, during, the, remainder, of, april, and, early, may, the, presidential, guard, gendarmerie, and, the, youth, militia, aided, by, local, populations, continued, killing, at, a, very, high, rate, the, goal, was, to, kill, every, tutsi, living, in, rwanda, and, with, the, exception, of, the, advancing, rebel, rpf, army, there, was, no, opposition, force, to, prevent, or, slow, the, killings, the, domestic, opposition, had, already, been, eliminated, and, unamir, were, expressly, forbidden, to, use, force, except, in, self, defence, in, rural, areas, where, tutsi, and, hutu, lived, side, by, side, and, families, knew, each, other, it, was, easy, for, hutu, to, identify, and, target, their, tutsi, neighbours, in, urban, areas, where, residents, were, more, anonymous, identification, was, facilitated, using, roadblocks, manned, by, military, and, interahamwe, each, person, passing, the, roadblock, was, required, to, show, the, national, identity, card, which, included, ethnicity, and, any, with, tutsi, cards, were, killed, immediately, many, hutu, were, also, killed, for, a, variety, of, reasons, including, alleged, sympathy, for, the, moderate, opposition, parties, being, a, journalist, or, simply, having, a, tutsi, appearance, thousands, of, bodies, were, dumped, into, the, kagera, river, which, ran, along, the, northern, border, between, rwanda, and, uganda, and, flowed, into, lake, victoria, this, disposal, of, bodies, caused, significant, damage, to, the, ugandan, fishing, industry, as, consumers, refused, to, buy, fish, caught, in, lake, victoria, for, fear, that, they, were, tainted, by, decomposing, corpses, the, ugandan, government, responded, by, dispatching, teams, to, retrieve, the, bodies, from, the, kagera, river, before, they, entered, the, lake, the, rpf, was, making, slow, but, steady, gains, in, the, north, and, east, of, the, country, ending, the, killings, in, each, area, occupied, the, genocide, was, effectively, ended, during, april, in, areas, of, ruhengeri, byumba, kibungo, and, kigali,

control, in, the, remaining, prefectures, killings, continued, throughout, may, and, june, although, they, became, increasingly, low, key, and, sporadic, most, tutsi, were, already, dead, and, the,

resume, the, civil, war, if, the, killing, did, not, stop, the, next, day, rwandan, government, forces, attacked, the, national, parliament, building, from, several, directions, but, rpf, troops, stationed, there, successfully, fought, back, the, rpf, then, began, an, attack, from, the, north, on, three, fronts, seeking, to, link, up, quickly, with, the, isolated, troops, in, kigali, kagame, refused, to, talk, to, the, interim, government, believing, that, it, was, just, a, cover, for, bagosora, s, rule, and, not, committed, to, ending, the, genocide, over, the, next, few, days, the, rpf, advanced, steadily, south, capturing, gabiro, and, large, areas, of, the, countryside, to, the, north, and, east, of, kigali, they, avoided, attacking, the, capital, city, kigali, or, byumba, but, conducted, manoeuvres, designed, to, encircle, the, cities, and, cut, off, supply, routes, the, rpf, also, allowed, tutsi, refugees, from, uganda, to, settle, behind, the, front, line, in, the, rpf, controlled, areas, throughout, april, there, were, numerous, attempts, by, unamir, to, establish, a, ceasefire, but, kagame, insisted, each, time, that, the, rpf, would, not, stop, fighting, unless, the, killings, stopped, in, late, april, the, rpf, secured, the, whole, of, the, tanzanian, border, area, and, began, to, move, west, from, kibungo, to, the, south, of, kigali, they, encountered, little, resistance, except, around, kigali, and, ruhengeri, by, 16, may, they, had, cut, the, road, between, kigali, and, gitarama, the, temporary, home, of, the, interim, government, and, by, 13, june, had, taken, gitarama, itself, following, an, unsuccessful, attempt, by, the, rwandan, government, forces, to, reopen, the, road, the, interim, government, was, forced, to, relocate, to, gisenyi, in, the, far, north, west, as, well, as, fighting, the, war, kagame, was, recruiting, heavily, to, expand, the, army, the, new, recruits, included, tutsi, survivors, of, the, genocide, and, refugees, from, burundi, but, were, less, well, trained, and, disciplined, than, the, earlier, recruits, having, completed, the, encirclement, of, kigali, the, rpf, spent, the, latter, half, of, june, fighting, for, the, city, itself, the, government, forces, had, superior, manpower, and, weapons, but, the, rpf, steadily, gained, territory, as, well, as, conducting, raids, to, rescue, civilians, from, behind, enemy, lines, according, to, dallaire, this, success, was, due, to, kagame, s, being, a, master, of, psychological, warfare, he, exploited, the, fact, that, the, government, forces, were, concentrating, on, the, genocide, rather, than, the, fight, for, kigali, and, capitalised, on, the, government, s, loss, of, morale, as, it, lost, territory, the, rpf, finally, defeated, the, rwandan, government, forces, in, kigali, on, 4, july, and, on, 18, july, took, gisenyi, and, the, rest, of, the, northwest, forcing, the, interim, government, to, flee, into, zaire, and, finally, ending, the, genocide, at, the, end, of, july, 1994, kagame, s, forces, held, the, whole, of, rwanda, except, for, the, zone, in, the, south, west, which, had, been, occupied, by, a, french, led, united, nations, force, as, part, of, op, ration, turquoise, the, liberation, day, for, rwanda, would, come, to, be, marked, as, 4, july, and, is, commemorated, as, a, public, holiday, during, the, genocide, and, in, the, months, following, the, rpf, victory, rpf, soldiers, killed, many, people, although, the, number, of, casualties, is, disputed, alison, des, forges, was, one, of, the, first, researchers, to, conclude, that, rpf, committed, atrocities, in, a, systematic, fashion, that, were, directed, by, officers, with, a, high, level, of, authority, she, estimated, that, rpf, killed, around, 30, 000, people, considered, enemies, of, the, tutsi, some, witnesses, blamed, kagame, himself, for, ordering, killings, after, ictr, investigators, reportedly, discovered, two, layers, of, bodies, in, a, mass, grave, in, kibuye, in, early, 1996, one, of, tutsi, victims, of, the, genocide, and, another, left, by, rpf, killings, of, hutu, civilians, further, forensic, investigations, were, prohibited, by, the, rwandan, government, french, scholar, andr, guichaoua, charged, the, post, genocide, government, with, deliberate, destruction, of, evidence, regarding, killings, of, hutu, in, order, to, avoid, prosecution, by, the, ictr, some, critics, have, suggested, that, these, crimes, should, have, been, prosecuted, by, the, ictr, or, even, amounted, to, genocide, under, international, law, in, contrast, the, post, genocide, regime, maintains, that, killings, by, rpf, soldiers, were, perpetrated, by, undisciplined, recruits, seeking, revenge, and, that, all, such, transgressions, were, promptly, punished, the, first, rumours, of, rpf, killings, emerged, after, 250, 000, mostly, hutu, refugees, streamed, into, tanzania, at, the, border, crossing, of, rusumo, on, 28, april, 1994, the, refugees, had, fled, before, the, tutsi, rebels, arrived, because, they, believed, the, rpf, were, committing, atrocities, a, spokesperson, for, the, united, nations, high, commissioner, for, refugees, unhcr, observed, that, there, s, a, lot, of, propaganda, by, the, government, radio, aimed, at, the, hutu, which, makes, them, feel, very, anti, tutsi, after, the, rpf, took, control, of, the, border, crossing, at, rusumo, on, 30, april, refugees, continued, to, cross, the, kagera, river, ending, up, in, remote, areas, of, tanzania, in, early, may, the, unhcr, began, hearing, concrete, accounts, of, atrocities, and, made, this, information, public, on, 17, may, after, the, rpf, took, power, in, rwanda, unhcr, sent, a, team, led, by, robert, gersony, to, investigate, the, prospects, for, a, speedy, return, of, the, nearly, two, million, refugees, that, had, fled, rwanda, since, april, after, interviewing, 300, people, gersony, concluded, that, clearly, systematic, murders, and, persecution, of, the, hutu, population, in, certain, parts, of, the, country, had, taken, place, gersony, s, findings, were, suppressed, by, the, united, nations, the, gersony, report, did, not, technically, exist, because, gersony, did, not, complete, it, but, a, summary, of, an, oral, presentation, of, his, findings, was, leaked, in, 2010, gersony, s, personal, conclusion, was, that, between, april, and, august, 1994, the, rpf, had, killed, between, 25, 000, and, 45, 000, persons, between, 5, 000, and, 10, 000, persons, each, month, from, april, through, july, and, 5, 000, for, the, month, of, august, the, new, authorities, categorically, denied, the, allegations, of, gersony, details, of, which, leaked, to, the, press, according, to, an, rpa, officer, there, was, not, time, to, do, proper, screening, we, needed, a, force, and, some, of, those, recruited, were, thieves, and, criminals, those, people, have, been, responsible, for, much, of, our, trouble, today, in, an, interview, with, journalist, stephen, kinzer, kagame, acknowledged, that, killings, had, occurred, but, stated, that, they, were, carried, out, by, rogue, soldiers, and, had, been, impossible, to, control, the, rpf, killings, gained, international, attention, with, the, 1995, kibeho, massacre, in, which, soldiers, opened, fire, on, a, camp, for, internally, displaced, persons, in, butare, prefecture, australian, soldiers, serving, as, part, of, unamir, estimated, at, least, 4, 000, people, were, killed, while, the, rwandan, government, claimed, that, the, death, toll, was, 338, the, united, nations, assistance, mission, for, rwanda, unamir, had, been, in, rwanda, since, october, 1993, with, a, mandate, to, oversee, the, implementation, of, the, arusha, accords, unamir, commander, rom, o, dallaire, learned, of, the, hutu, power, movement, during, the, mission, s, deployment, as, well, as, plans, for, the, mass, extermination, of, tutsi, he, also, became, aware, of, secret, weapons, caches, through, an, informant, but, his, request, to, raid, them, was, turned, down, by, the, un, department, of, peacekeeping, operations, dpko, which, felt, that, dallaire, was, exceeding, his, mandate, and, had, to, be, kept, on, a, leash, seizing, the, weapons, was, argued, to, be, squarely, within, unamir, s, mandate, both, sides, had, requested, unamir, and, it, had, been, authorized, by, the, un, security, council, in, resolution, 872, unamir, s, effectiveness, in, peacekeeping, was, also, hampered, by, president, habyarimana, and, hutu, hardliners, and, by, april, 1994, the, security, council, threatened, to, terminate, unamir, s, mandate, if, it, did, not, make, progress, following, the, death, of, habyarimana, and, the, start, of, the, genocide, dallaire, liaised, repeatedly, with, both, the, crisis, committee, and, the, rpf, attempting, to, re, establish, peace, and, prevent, the, resumption, of, the, civil, war, neither, side, was, interested, in, a, ceasefire, the, government, because, it, was, controlled, by, the, genocidaires, and, the, rpf, because, it, considered, it, necessary, to, fight, to, stop, the, killings, unamir, s, chapter, vi, mandate, rendered, it, powerless, to, intervene, militarily, and, most, of, its, rwandan, staff, were, killed, in, the, early, days, of, the, genocide, severely, limiting, its, ability, to, operate, unamir, was, therefore, largely, reduced, to, a, bystander, role, and, dallaire, later, labelled, it, a, failure, its, most, significant, contribution, was, to, provide, refuge, for, thousands, of, tutsi, and, moderate, hutu, at, its, headquarters, in, amahoro, stadium, as, well, as, other, secure, un, sites, and, to, assist, with, the, evacuation, of, foreign, nationals, on, 12, april, the,

interpreted, turquoise, as, a, mission, to, protect, hutu, from, the, rpf, including, some, who, had, participated, in, the, genocide, the, french, remained, hostile, to, the, rpf, and, their, presence, temporarily, stalled, the, rpf, s, advance, a, number, of, inquiries, have, been, held, into, french, involvement, in, rwanda, including, the, 1998, french, parliamentary, commission, on, rwanda, which, accused, france, of, errors, of, judgement, including, military, cooperation, against, a, background, of, ethnic, tensions, massacres, and, violence, but, did, not, accuse, france, of, direct, responsibility, for, the, genocide, itself, a, 2008, report, by, the, rwandan, government, sponsored, mucyo, commission, accused, the, french, government, of, knowing, of, preparations, for,

rwandan, prison, system, leading, to, what, amnesty, international, deemed, cruel, inhuman, or, degrading, treatment, the, country, s, 19, prisons, were, designed, to, hold, about, 18, 000, inmates, total, but, at, their, peak, in, 1998, there, were, over, 100, 000, people, in, crowded, detention, facilities, across, the, country, government, institutions, including, judicial, courts, were, destroyed, and, many, judges, prosecutors, and, employees, were, murdered, during, the, genocide, of, rwanda, s, 750, judges, 506, did, not, remain, after, the, genocide, many, were, murdered, and, most, of, the, survivors, fled, rwanda, by, 1997, rwanda, only, had, 50, lawyers, in, its, judicial, system, these, barriers, caused, the, trials, to, proceed, very, slowly, with, 130, 000, suspects, held, in, rwandan, prisons, after, the, genocide, 3, 343, cases, were, handled, between, 1996, and, the, end, of, 2000, of, those, defendants, 20, received, death, sentences, 32, received, life, in, prison, and, 20, were, acquitted, it, was, calculated, that, it, would, take, over, 200, years, to, conduct, the, trials, of, the, suspects, in, prison, not, including, the, ones, who, remained, at, large, the, rpf, government, began, the, long, awaited, genocide, trials, which, had, an, uncertain, start, at, the, end, of, 1996, and, inched, forward, in, 1997, it, was, not, until, 1996, that, courts, finally, began, trials, for, genocide, cases, with, the, enactment, of, organic, law, no, 08, 96, of, 30, on, 30, august, 1996, this, law, initiated, the, prosecution, of, genocide, crimes, committed, during, the, genocide, and, of, crimes, against, humanity, from, october, 1990, this, law, established, the, regular, domestic, courts, as, the, core, mechanism, for, responding, to, genocide, until, it, was, amended, in, 2001, to, include, the, gacaca, courts, the, organic, law, established, four, categories, for, those, who, were, involved, in, the, genocide, specifying, the, limits, of, punishment, for, members, of, each, category, the, first, category, was, reserved, those, who, were, planners, organizers, instigators, supervisors, and, leaders, of, the, genocide, and, any, who, used, positions, of, state, authority, to, promote, the, genocide, this, category, also, applied, to, murderers, who, distinguished, themselves, on, the, basis, of, their, zeal, or, cruelty, or, who, engaged, in, sexual, torture, members, of, this, first, category, were, eligible, for, the, death, sentence, while, rwanda, had, the, death, penalty, prior, to, the, 1996, organic, law, in, practice, no, executions, had, taken, place, since, 1982, twenty, two, individuals, including, froduald, karamira, were, executed, by, firing, squad, in, public, executions, in, april, 1998, after, this, rwanda, conducted, no, further, executions, albeit, it, continued, to, issue, death, sentences, until, 2003, on, 25, july, 2007, the, organic, law, relating, to, the, abolition, of, the, death, penalty, came, into, law, abolishing, capital, punishment, and, converting, all, existing, death, sentences, to, life, in, prison, under, solitary, confinement, in, parallel, the, 2007, un, resolution, presented, and, campaigns, continued, for, a, global, moratorium, on, capital, punishment, in, response, to, the, overwhelming, number, of, potentially, culpable, individuals, and, the, slow, pace, of, the, traditional, judicial, system, the, government, of, rwanda, passed, organic, law, no, 40, 2000, in, 2001, this, law, established, gacaca, courts, at, all, administrative, levels, of, rwanda, and, in, kigali, it, was, mainly, created, to, lessen, the, burden, on, normal, courts, and, provide, assistance, in, the, justice, system, to, run, trials, for, those, already, in, prison, the, least, severe, cases, according, to, the, terms, of, organic, law, no, 08, 96, of, 30, would, be, handled, by, these, gacaca, courts, with, this, law, the, government, began, implementing, a, participatory, justice, system, known, as, gacaca, in, order, to, address, the, enormous, backlog, of, cases, the, gacaca, court, system, traditionally, dealt, with, conflicts, within, communities, but, it, was, adapted, to, deal, with, genocide, crimes, among, the, principal, objectives, of, the, courts, were, identification, of, the, truth, about, what, happened, during, the, genocide, speeding, up, the, process, of, trying, genocide, suspects, national, unity, and, reconciliation, and, demonstrating, the, capacity, of, the, rwandan, people, to, resolve, their, own, problems, the, gacaca, court, system, faced, many, controversies, and, challenges, they, were, accused, of, being, puppets, of, the, rpf, dominated, government, the, judges, known, as, inyangamugayo, which, means, those, who, detest, dishonesty, in, kinyarwanda, who, preside, over, the, genocide, trials, were, elected, by, the, public, after, election, the, judges, received, training, but, there, was, concern, that, the, training, was, not, adequate, for, serious, legal, questions, or, complex, proceedings, furthermore, many, judges, resigned, after, facing, accusations, of, participating, in, the, genocide, 27, of, them, were, so, accused, there, was, also, a, lack, of, defense, counsel, and, protections, for, the, accused, who, were, denied, the, right, to, appeal, to, ordinary, courts, most, trials, were, open, to, the, public, but, there, were, issues, with, witness, intimidation, the, gacaca, courts, did, not, try, those, responsible, for, massacres, of, hutu, civilians, committed, by, members, of, the, rpf, which, controlled, the, gacaca, court, system, on, 18, june, 2012, the, gacaca, court, system, was, officially, closed, after, facing, criticism, it, is, estimated, that, the, gacaca, court, system, tried, 1, 958, 634, cases, during, its, lifetime, and, that, 1, 003, 227, persons, stood, trial, meanwhile, the, un, established, the, international, criminal, tribunal, for, rwanda, ictr, based, in, arusha, tanzania, the, un, tribunal, tried, high, level, members, of, the, government, and, armed, forces, while, rwanda, prosecuted, lower, level, leaders, and, local, people, since, the, ictr, was, established, as, an, ad, hoc, international, jurisdiction, the, ictr, was, scheduled, to, close, by, the, end, of, 2014, after, it, would, complete, trials, by, 2009, and, appeals, by, 2010, or, 2011, initially, the, u, n, security, council, established, the, ictr, in, 1994, with, an, original, mandate, of, four, years, without, a, fixed, deadline, and, set, on, addressing, the, crimes, committed, during, the, rwandan, genocide, as, the, years, passed, it, became, apparent, that, the, ictr, would, exist, long, past, its, original, mandate, with, the, announcement, of, its, closing, there, was, a, concern, over, how, residual, issues, would, be, handled, because, the, nature, of, criminal, judicial, work, is, such, that, it, never, really, ends, the, ictr, officially, closed, on, 31, december, 2015, and, its, remaining, functions, were, handed, over, to, the, mechanism, for, international, criminal, tribunals, article,

asserted, that, any, acknowledgment, of, the, separate, people, was, detrimental, to, the, unification, of, post, genocide, rwanda, and, has, created, numerous, laws, to, prevent, rwandans, from, promoting, a, genocide, ideology, and, divisionism, the, law, does, not, explicitly, define, such, terms, nor, does, it, state, that, one, s, beliefs, must, be, spoken, for, example, the, law, defines, divisionism, as, the, use, of, any, speech, written, statement, or, action, that, divides, people, that, is, likely, to, spark, conflicts, among, people, or, that, causes, an, uprising, which, might, degenerate, into, strife, among, people, based, on, discrimination, fear, of, the, possible, ramifications, from, breaking, these, laws, have, caused, a, culture, of, self, censorship, within, the, population, both, civilians, and, the, press, typically, avoid, anything, that, could, be, construed, as, critical, of, the, government, military, or, promoting, divisionism, under, the,
