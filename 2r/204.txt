https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxons
the, saxons, sometimes, called, the, old, saxons, were, the, germanic, people, of, old, saxony, latin, antiqua, saxonia, which, became, a, carolingian, stem, duchy, in, 804, in, what, is, now, northern, germany, the, political, history, of, these, inland, saxons, who, were, neighbours, of, the, franks, is, unclear, until, the, 8th, century, and, the, conflict, between, their, semi, legendary, hero, widukind, and, the, frankish, emperor, charlemagne, they, do, not, appear, to, have, been, politically, united, until, about, that, time, previous, frankish, rulers, of, austrasia, both, merovingian, and, carolingian, fought, numerous, campaigns, against, saxons, both, in, the, west, near, the, lippe, ems, and, weser, and, further, east, neighbouring, thuringia, and, bohemia, later, medieval, sources, referred, to, this, eastern, area, as, north, swabia, charlemagne, conquered, all, the, saxons, after, winning, the, long, saxon, wars, 772, 804, and, forced, them, to, convert, to, christianity, annexing, saxony, into, the, carolingian, domain, under, the, carolingian, franks, saxony, became, a, single, duchy, fitting, it, within, the, basic, political, structure, of, the, later, holy, roman, empire, the, early, rulers, of, this, duchy, of, saxony, expanded, their, territories, and, therefore, those, of, the, holy, roman, empire, to, the, east, at, the, expense, of, slavic, speaking, wends, before, the, entry, of, saxony, into, frankish, history, there, is, possibly, a, single, classical, reference, to, a, smaller, and, still, much, earlier, saxon, tribe, but, the, interpretation, of, this, text, axones, in, most, surviving, manuscripts, is, disputed, according, to, this, proposal, the, original, saxon, tribe, lived, north, of, the, mouth, of, the, elbe, close, to, the, probable, homeland, of, the, angles, what, is, more, certain, is, that, long, before, any, clear, historical, mention, of, saxony, as, a, country, a, related, but, possibly, distinct, or, overlapping, group, of, saxons, became, important, during, the, late, roman, empire, when, the, name, was, used, to, refer, to, coastal, raiders, who, attacked, from, the, north, by, in, a, similar, sense, to, the, much, later, term, viking, these, early, raiders, and, settlers, came, from, coastal, regions, north, of, the, rhine, they, included, frisians, angles, and, jutes, as, well, as, people, from, the, coastal, part, of, what, came, to, be, called, saxony, one, of, the, first, writers, to, mention, the, country, saxony, appears, to, have, been, a, ostrogothic, geographer, of, italy, named, marcomir, the, much, later, ravenna, cosmography, which, reproduces, some, of, his, reports, uses, the, same, term, old, saxony, to, refer, to, the, apparent, continental, homeland, of, the, british, saxons, who, the, writer, understood, to, have, came, from, this, old, saxony, with, their, leader, named, ansehis, it, describes, the, lands, of, the, saxons, as, lying, on, the, ocean, coast, between, frisia, and, the, danes, it, contained, the, rivers, lamizon, ipada, lippa, and, limac, generally, interpreted, as, the, ems, pader, lippe, and, leine, today, the, saxons, of, germany, no, longer, form, a, distinctive, ethnic, group, or, country, but, their, name, lives, on, in, the, names, of, several, regions, and, states, of, germany, including, lower, saxony, german, niedersachsen, which, includes, most, of, the, original, duchy, their, language, evolved, into, low, german, which, was, the, lingua, franca, of, the, hanseatic, league, but, has, faced, a, long, and, gradual, decline, since, the, late, medieval, period, as, a, literary, administrative, and, to, a, significant, extent, cultural, language, in, favor, of, dutch, and, german, the, first, saxons, clearly, mentioned, in, ancient, records, were, the, saxons, who, became, important, during, the, late, roman, empire, as, coastal, raiders, who, attacked, from, the, north, using, boats, in, a, similar, sense, to, the, much, later, term, viking, these, early, raiders, and, settlers, were, believed, by, contemporaries, to, come, from, coastal, regions, north, of, the, rhine, they, included, frisians, angles, and, jutes, who, stretched, from, what, is, now, the, netherlands, to, what, is, now, denmark, as, well, as, coastal, parts, of, the, territory, which, came, to, be, called, saxony, it, has, been, proposed, that, these, coastal, saxons, should, be, seen, as, a, distinct, but, related, people, with, an, etymologically, equivalent, name, such, as, the, dutch, and, deutschen, germans, today, significant, numbers, of, these, early, saxons, settled, in, what, later, became, northern, france, and, england, and, england, rather, than, saxony, was, sometimes, seen, as, the, saxon, homeland, to, avoid, confusion, already, in, the, 8th, century, authors, such, as, bede, sometimes, referred, to, the, saxons, of, saxony, in, germany, as, the, old, saxons, and, their, country, as, old, saxony, and, this, differentiation, is, still, often, used, by, historians, today, when, discussing, this, period, in, contrast, the, settlers, once, called, saxons, in, england, became, part, of, a, new, old, english, speaking, nation, now, commonly, referred, to, as, the, anglo, saxons, or, simply, the, english, this, brought, together, local, romano, british, populations, saxons, and, other, migrants, from, the, same, north, sea, region, including, frisians, jutes, and, angles, the, angles, are, the, source, of, the, term, english, which, became, the, more, commonly, used, collective, term, the, term, anglo, saxon, combining, the, names, of, the, angles, and, the, saxons, came, into, use, by, the, eighth, century, initially, in, the, work, of, paul, the, deacon, to, distinguish, the, germanic, speaking, inhabitants, of, britain, from, continental, saxons, but, both, the, saxons, of, britain, and, those, of, old, saxony, in, northern, germany, long, continued, to, be, referred, to, as, saxons, in, an, indiscriminate, manner, the, name, of, the, saxons, has, traditionally, been, said, to, derive, from, a, kind, of, knife, used, in, this, period, and, called, a, seax, in, old, english, and, sachs, in, old, high, german, during, the, first, centuries, of, its, use, the, term, saxon, was, associated, with, raiders, and, not, associated, with, any, clearly, defined, homeland, apart, from, the, settlements, of, saxons, in, what, are, now, england, and, normandy, it, is, only, much, later, that, the, medieval, records, of, the, frankish, empire, began, to, refer, to, a, largely, inland, nation, of, saxons, in, what, is, now, northern, germany, although, it, became, convenient, to, refer, to, the, english, saxons, as, either, english, or, as, anglo, saxons, after, this, point, the, term, saxon, was, still, used, to, refer, to, them, for, some, time, and, can, be, a, source, of, potential, confusion, when, interpreting, contemporary, records, ptolemy, s, geographia, written, in, the, second, century, is, sometimes, considered, to, contain, the, first, mention, of, the, saxons, some, copies, of, this, text, mention, a, tribe, called, saxones, in, the, area, to, the, north, of, the, lower, elbe, however, other, versions, refer, to, the, same, tribe, as, axones, this, may, be, a, misspelling, of, the, tribe, that, tacitus, in, his, germania, called, aviones, according, to, this, theory, saxones, was, the, result, of, later, scribes, trying, to, correct, a, name, that, meant, nothing, to, them, on, the, other, hand, sch, tte, in, his, analysis, of, such, problems, in, ptolemy, s, maps, of, northern, europe, believed, that, saxones, is, correct, he, notes, that, the, loss, of, first, letters, occurs, in, numerous, places, in, various, copies, of, ptolemy, s, work, and, also, that, the, manuscripts, without, saxones, are, generally, inferior, overall, the, first, undisputed, mentions, of, the, saxon, name, come, from, the, late, 4th, century, around, the, time, of, emperor, julian, by, about, 400, the, notitia, dignitatum, shows, that, the, romans, had, created, several, military, commands, specifically, to, defend, against, saxon, raiders, the, litus, saxonicum, saxon, shore, was, composed, of, nine, forts, stretching, around, the, south, eastern, corner, of, england, on, the, other, side, of, the, english, channel, two, coastal, military, commands, were, created, over, the, tractus, armoricanus, in, what, is, now, brittany, and, normandy, and, the, coast, of, belgica, secunda, in, what, later, became, flanders, and, picardy, the, notitia, dignitatum, also, lists, the, existence, of, a, saxon, military, unit, an, ala, in, the, roman, military, which, was, stationed, in, what, is, now, lebanon, and, northern, israel, this, ala, primum, saxonum, already, existed, by, 363, when, julian, used, them, in, arabia, against, the, persian, empire, roman, military, accessories, are, found, in, northern, germany, in, the, 4th, and, 5th, centuries, apparently, indicating, the, return, of, soldiers, who, had, served, the, empire, several, records, mentioning, the, early, saxons, can, be, dated, in, almost, all, of, these, cases, the, saxons, were, associated, with, using, boats, for, their, raids, even, within, the, maas, delta, region, special, mentions, of, the, fearful, 4th, century, saxon, surprise, attacks, were, made, not, only, by, ammianus, but, also, by, the, poet, claudian, some, generations, later, a, dramatic, description, of, saxon, raiding, was, written, by, sidonius, apollinaris, writing, to, a, friend, who, was, assigned, to, a, coastal, defensive, post, in, saintonge, near, bordeaux, a, rough, description, of, the, homeland, of, these, saxons, was, given, by, hilarion, who, says, the, frankish, homeland, lay, between, the, saxons, and, alemanni, in, 441, 442, ad, saxons, are, mentioned, in, the, chronica, gallica, of, 452, which, says, that, the, british, provinces, which, to, this, time, had, suffered, various, defeats, and, misfortunes, are, reduced, to, saxon, rule, some, generations, later, gildas, is, generally, seen, as, reporting, what, happened, although, he, gave, no, date, according, to, him, a, saxon, force, based, in, the, east, of, britain, bede, later, believed, in, the, isle, of, thanet, were, invited, as, foederati, to, britain, in, order, to, help, defend, against, raids, by, picts, and, scots, they, revolted, over, their, pay, and, plundered, the, whole, country, initiating, a, long, war, by, the, time, of, gildas, in, the, 6th, century, the, romano, british, had, recovered, control, of, at, least, part, of, the, country, but, were, now, divided, into, corrupt, tyrannies, there, are, very, few, records, of, the, period, but, by, the, time, of, bede, in, the, 8th, century, most, of, england, was, ruled, by, anglo, saxon, kingdoms, in, the, 460s, an, apparent, fragment, of, a, chronicle, preserved, in, the, history, of, the, franks, of, gregory, of, tours, gives, a, confusing, report, about, a, number, of, battles, involving, one, adovacrius, who, led, a, group, of, saxons, based, upon, islands, somewhere, near, the, mouth, of, the, loire, he, took, hostages, at, anger, in, france, but, his, force, was, subsequently, retaken, by, roman, and, frankish, forces, led, by, childeric, i, a, great, war, was, waged, between, the, saxons, and, the, romans, but, the, saxons, turning, their, backs, with, the, romans, pursuing, lost, many, of, their, men, to, the, sword, their, islands, were, captured, and, ravaged, by, the, franks, many, people, being, killed, though, there, is, no, consensus, many, historians, believe, that, this, adovacrius, may, be, the, same, person, as, odoacer, the, future, king, of, italy, who, is, mentioned, in, the, same, part, of, gregory, s, text, as, a, person, who, subsequently, allied, with, childeric, to, fight, alemanni, in, italy, in, comparison, to, mentions, of, the, early, saxons, raiders, and, settlers, in, britain, or, gaul, there, are, few, mentions, of, the, saxons, in, germany, before, the, 8th, century, interpretation, of, the, records, is, also, complicated, not, only, by, the, continuing, references, to, the, other, saxons, but, also, because, the, german, saxons, possibly, weren, t, originally, unified, within, one, saxon, political, entity, it, is, therefore, not, clear, whether, some, early, continental, saxons, could, also, sometimes, have, come, under, other, designations, such, as, warini, frisians, or, thuringians, nevertheless, some, records, during, merovingian, times, are, clearly, about, saxons, living, within, what, is, now, northern, germany, north, of, the, franks, there, were, also, saxon, populations, in, this, period, who, were, living, in, neither, england, nor, what, would, become, saxony, the, continental, saxons, appear, to, have, become, consolidated, by, the, end, of, the, eighth, century, partly, as, a, result, of, interaction, with, the, powerful, frankish, kingdoms, the, ancestors, of, charlemagne, the, arnulfings, took, control, of, the, neighbouring, austrasian, kingdom, of, the, franks, and, sought, to, assert, power, over, the, peoples, to, the, east, including, not, only, the, bavarians, swabians, and, thuringians, which, were, long, under, frankish, rule, but, also, the, saxons, and, frisians, they, also, pressured, the, saxons, and, frisians, to, convert, to, christianity, in, 804, the, emperor, charlemagne, conquered, the, saxons, and, incorporated, the, saxons, into, the, frankish, empire, as, a, stem, duchy, similar, to, the, older, ones, although, there, is, no, evidence, that, it, had, previously, been, a, single, kingdom, the, duchy, of, saxony, 804, 1296, covered, westphalia, eastphalia, angria, and, nordalbingia, which, is, roughly, equivalent, to, holstein, the, southern, part, of, modern, day, schleswig, holstein, state, now, bordering, on, denmark, the, saxons, were, conquered, by, charlemagne, after, a, long, series, of, annual, campaigns, the, saxon, wars, 772, 804, with, defeat, came, enforced, baptism, and, conversion, as, well, as, the, union, of, the, saxons, with, the, rest, of, the, germanic, frankish, empire, their, sacred, tree, or, pillar, a, symbol, of, irminsul, was, destroyed, charlemagne, deported, 10, 000, nordalbingian, saxons, to, neustria, and, gave, their, largely, vacant, lands, in, wagria, approximately, modern, pl, n, and, ostholstein, districts, to, the, loyal, king, of, the, abotrites, einhard, charlemagne, s, biographer, says, on, the, closing, of, this, grand, conflict, the, war, that, had, lasted, so, many, years, was, at, length, ended, by, their, acceding, to, the, terms, offered, by, the, king, which, were, renunciation, of, their, national, religious, customs, and, the, worship, of, devils, acceptance, of, the, sacraments, of, the, christian, faith, and, religion, and, union, with, the, franks, to, form, one, people, the, saxons, long, resisted, becoming, christians, and, being, incorporated, into, the, orbit, of, the, frankish, kingdom, in, 776, the, saxons, promised, to, convert, to, christianity, and, vow, loyalty, to, the, king, but, during, charlemagne, s, campaign, in, hispania, 778, the, saxons, advanced, to, deutz, on, the, rhine, and, plundered, along, the, river, this, was, an, oft, repeated, pattern, when, charlemagne, was, distracted, by, other, matters, under, carolingian, rule, the, saxons, were, reduced, to, tributary, status, there, is, evidence, that, the, saxons, as, well, as, slavic, tributaries, such, as, the, abodrites, and, the, wends, often, provided, troops, to, their, carolingian, overlords, the, dukes, of, saxony, became, kings, henry, i, the, fowler, 919, and, later, the, first, emperors, henry, s, son, otto, i, the, great, of, germany, during, the, tenth, century, but, they, lost, this, position, in, 1024, the, duchy, was, divided, in, 1180, when, duke, henry, the, lion, refused, to, follow, his, cousin, emperor, frederick, barbarossa, into, war, in, lombardy, during, the, high, middle, ages, under, the, salian, emperors, and, later, under, the, teutonic, knights, german, settlers, moved, east, of, the, saale, into, the, area, of, a, western, slavic, tribe, the, sorbs, the, sorbs, were, gradually, germanised, this, region, subsequently, acquired, the, name, saxony, through, political, circumstances, though, it, was, initially, called, the, march, of, meissen, the, rulers, of, meissen, acquired, control, of, the, duchy, of, saxe, wittenberg, only, a, remnant, of, the, previous, duchy, in, 1423, they, eventually, applied, the, name, saxony, to, the, whole, of, their, kingdom, since, then, this, part, of, eastern, germany, has, been, referred, to, as, saxony, german, sachsen, a, source, of, some, misunderstanding, about, the, original, homeland, of, the, saxons, with, a, central, part, in, the, present, day, german, state, of, lower, saxony, german, niedersachsen, old, english, associated, with, the, saxons, in, england, was, closer, to, later, recorded, dialects, of, old, frisian, than, the, old, saxon, language, old, frisian, apparently, once, stretched, along, the, north, sea, coast, from, the, northern, netherlands, to, southern, denmark, while, old, saxon, originally, didn, t, extend, to, the, coast, linguists, have, noted, that, old, frisian, and, old, saxon, although, neighbouring, and, related, did, not, form, part, of, the, same, dialect, continuum, in, contrast, the, saxon, dialects, became, part, of, the, much, larger, continental, west, germanic, continuum, which, stretched, to, the, alps, and, can, all, be, considered, to, be, types, of, german, according, to, the, historical, linguist, elmar, seebold, this, development, can, only, be, explained, if, continental, saxon, society, prior, to, the, migration, to, britain, was, effectively, composed, of, two, related, but, different, forms, of, west, germanic, in, his, view, the, group, of, people, who, in, the, 3rd, century, first, migrated, southwards, to, what, is, now, the, northwestern, portion, of, lower, saxony, spoke, north, sea, germanic, dialects, closely, related, to, old, frisian, and, old, english, there, these, migrants, encountered, an, already, present, population, whose, language, was, significantly, different, from, their, own, i, e, belonging, to, the, weser, rhine, germanic, grouping, over, whom, they, then, formed, an, elite, lending, their, name, to, the, subsequent, tribal, federation, and, region, as, a, whole, later, during, the, 5th, century, as, the, angles, started, migrating, to, britain, the, descendants, of, this, elite, joined, them, while, the, descendants, of, the, native, inhabitants, did, not, or, at, least, not, significantly, as, the, languages, of, the, angles, and, this, particular, saxon, group, were, closely, related, a, continuum, between, anglian, and, saxon, could, form, in, britain, which, later, became, english, in, the, land, of, the, saxons, itself, the, departure, of, a, large, part, of, this, former, elite, caused, the, sociopolitical, landscape, to, change, and, the, original, population, after, the, departure, of, the, majority, of, the, elite, s, descendants, became, so, predominant, that, their, dialects, presumably, the, language, of, the, chauci, the, language, of, the, thuringians, and, possibly, other, ancient, tribes, prevailed, and, ultimately, formed, the, basis, for, the, low, saxon, dialects, known, today, while, their, speakers, retained, the, tribal, name, bede, a, northumbrian, writing, around, the, year, 730, remarks, that, the, old, that, is, the, continental, saxons, have, no, king, but, they, are, governed, by, several, ealdormen, or, satrapa, who, during, war, cast, lots, for, leadership, but, who, in, time, of, peace, are, equal, in, power, the, regnum, saxonum, was, divided, into, three, provinces, westphalia, eastphalia, and, angria, which, comprised, about, one, hundred, pagi, or, gaue, each, gau, had, its, own, satrap, with, enough, military, power, to, level, whole, villages, that, opposed, him, in, the, mid, 9th, century, nithard, first, described, the, social, structure, of, the, saxons, beneath, their, leaders, the, caste, structure, was, rigid, in, the, saxon, language, the, three, castes, excluding, slaves, were, called, the, edhilingui, related, to, the, term, aetheling, frilingi, and, lazzi, these, terms, were, subsequently, latinised, as, nobiles, or, nobiliores, ingenui, ingenuiles, or, liberi, and, liberti, liti, or, serviles, according, to, very, early, traditions, that, are, presumed, to, contain, a, good, deal, of, historical, truth, the, edhilingui, were, the, descendants, of, the, saxons, who, led, the, tribe, out, of, holstein, and, during, the, migrations, of, the, sixth, century, they, were, a, conquering, warrior, elite, the, frilingi, represented, the, descendants, of, the, amicii, auxiliarii, and, manumissi, of, that, caste, the, lazzi, represented, the, descendants, of, the, original, inhabitants, of, the, conquered, territories, who, were, forced, to, make, oaths, of, submission, and, pay, tribute, to, the, edhilingui, the, lex, saxonum, regulated, the, saxons, different, society, intermarriage, between, the, castes, was, forbidden, by, the, lex, saxonum, and, wergilds, were, set, based, upon, caste, membership, the, edhilingui, were, worth, 1, 440, solidi, or, about, 700, head, of, cattle, the, highest, wergild, on, the, continent, the, price, of, a, bride, was, also, very, high, this, was, six, times, as, much, as, that, of, the, frilingi, and, eight, times, as, much, as, the, lazzi, the, gulf, between, noble, and, ignoble, was, very, large, but, the, difference, between, a, freeman, and, an, indentured, labourer, was, small, according, to, the, vita, lebuini, antiqua, an, important, source, for, early, saxon, history, the, saxons, held, an, annual, council, at, marklo, westphalia, where, they, confirmed, their, laws, gave, judgment, on, outstanding, cases, and, determined, by, common, counsel, whether, they, would, go, to, war, or, be, in, peace, that, year, all, three, castes, participated, in, the, general, council, twelve, representatives, from, each, caste, were, sent, from, each, gau, in, 782, charlemagne, abolished, the, system, of, gaue, and, replaced, it, with, the, grafschaftsverfassung, the, system, of, counties, typical, of, francia, by, prohibiting, the, marklo, councils, charlemagne, pushed, the, frilingi, and, lazzi, out, of, political, power, the, old, saxon, system, of, abgabengrundherrschaft, lordship, based, on, dues, and, taxes, was, replaced, by, a, form, of, feudalism, based, on, service, and, labour, personal, relationships, and, oaths, saxon, religious, practices, were, closely, related, to, their, political, practices, the, annual, councils, of, the, entire, tribe, began, with, invocations, of, the, gods, the, procedure, by, which, dukes, were, elected, in, wartime, by, drawing, lots, is, presumed, to, have, had, religious, significance, i, e, in, giving, trust, to, divine, providence, it, seems, to, guide, the, random, decision, making, there, were, also, sacred, rituals, and, objects, such, as, the, pillars, called, irminsul, these, were, believed, to, connect, heaven, and, earth, as, with, other, examples, of, trees, or, ladders, to, heaven, in, numerous, religions, charlemagne, had, one, such, pillar, chopped, down, in, 772, close, to, the, eresburg, stronghold, early, saxon, religious, practices, in, britain, can, be, gleaned, from, place, names, and, the, germanic, calendar, in, use, at, that, time, the, germanic, gods, woden, frigg, tiw, and, thunor, who, are, attested, to, in, every, germanic, tradition, were, worshipped, in, wessex, sussex, and, essex, they, are, the, only, ones, directly, attested, to, though, the, names, of, the, third, and, fourth, months, march, and, april, of, the, old, english, calendar, bear, the, names, hr, m, na, and, osturm, na, meaning, month, of, hretha, and, month, of, ostre, it, is, presumed, that, these, are, the, names, of, two, goddesses, who, were, worshipped, around, that, season, the, saxons, offered, cakes, to, their, gods, in, february, solm, na, there, was, a, religious, festival, associated, with, the, harvest, halegm, na, holy, month, or, month, of, offerings, september, the, saxon, calendar, began, on, 25, december, and, the, months, of, december, and, january, were, called, yule, or, giuli, they, contained, a, modra, niht, or, night, of, the, mothers, another, religious, festival, of, unknown, content, the, saxon, freemen, and, servile, class, remained, faithful, to, their, original, beliefs, long, after, their, nominal, conversion, to,

who, between, 745, and, 770, preached, to, the, saxons, mainly, in, the, eastern, netherlands, built, a, church, and, made, many, friends, among, the, nobility, some, of, them, rallied, to, save, him,

the, legal, decree, has, been, applied, for, fault, of, the, most, trifling, sort, imaginable, perhaps, they, would, not, be, averse, to, their, baptismal, vows, charlemagne, s, successor, louis, the,

overlordship, in, favour, of, their, old, paganism, as, late, as, the, 840s, when, the, stellinga, rose, up, against, the, saxon, leadership, who, were, allied, with, the, frankish, emperor, lothair,

roman, emperors, and, as, the, bringer, of, christian, salvation, to, people, references, are, made, to, periodic, outbreaks, of, pagan, worship, especially, of, freya, among, the, saxon, peasantry, as, late, as, the, 12th, century, in, the, ninth, century, the, saxon, nobility, became, vigorous, supporters, of, monasticism, and, formed, a, bulwark, of, christianity, against, the, existing,
