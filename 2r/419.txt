included, the, reformation, centralisation, excessive, taxation, and, the, rights, and, privileges, of, the, dutch, nobility, and, cities, after, the, initial, stages, philip, ii, of, spain, the, sovereign, of, the, netherlands, deployed, his, armies, and, regained, control, over, most, of, the, rebel, held, territories, however, widespread, mutinies, in, the, spanish, army, caused, a, general, uprising, under, the, leadership, of, the, exiled, william, the, silent, the, catholic, and, protestant, dominated, provinces, sought, to, establish, religious, peace, while, jointly, opposing, the, king, s, regime, with, the, pacification, of, ghent, but, the, general, rebellion, failed, to, sustain, itself, despite, governor, of, spanish, netherlands, and, general, for, spain, the, duke, of, parma, s, steady, military, and, diplomatic, successes, the, union, of, utrecht, continued, their, resistance, proclaiming, their, independence, through, the, 1581, act, of, abjuration, and, establishing, the, calvinist, dominated, dutch, republic, in, 1588, in, the, ten, years, thereafter, the, republic, whose, heartland, was, no, longer, threatened, made, conquests, in, the, north, and, east, and, received, diplomatic, recognition, from, france, and, england, in, 1596, the, dutch, colonial, empire, emerged, which, began, with, dutch, attacks, on, portugal, s, overseas, territories, facing, a, stalemate, the, two, sides, agreed, to, a, twelve, years, truce, in, 1609, when, it, expired, in, 1621, fighting, resumed, as, part, of, the, broader, thirty, years, war, an, end, was, reached, in, 1648, with, the, peace, of, m, nster, a, treaty, that, was, part, of, the, peace, of, westphalia, when, spain, retained, the, southern, netherlands, and, recognised, the, dutch, republic, as, an, independent, country, the, origins, of, the, eighty, years, war, are, complicated, and, have, been, a, source, of, disputes, amongst, historians, for, centuries, the, habsburg, netherlands, emerged, as, a, result, of, the, territorial, expansion, of, the, burgundian, state, in, the, 14th, and, 15th, centuries, upon, extinction, of, the, burgundian, state, in, 1477, 1482, these, lands, were, inherited, by, the, house, of, habsburg, whose, charles, v, became, both, king, of, spain, and, holy, roman, emperor, while, conquering, and, incorporating, the, rest, of, what, would, become, the, seventeen, provinces, during, the, guelders, wars, 1502, 1543, and, seeking, to, forge, and, centralise, these, disparate, regions, into, one, political, entity, charles, aspired, to, counter, the, protestant, reformation, and, keep, all, his, subjects, obedient, to, the, catholic, church, the, period, between, the, start, of, the, beeldenstorm, in, august, 1566, until, early, 1572, before, the, capture, of, brielle, on, 1, april, 1572, contained, the, first, events, of, a, series, that, would, later, be, known, as, the, eighty, years, war, between, the, spanish, empire, and, disparate, groups, of, rebels, in, the, habsburg, netherlands, some, of, the, first, pitched, battles, and, sieges, between, radical, calvinists, and, habsburg, governmental, forces, took, place, in, the, years, 1566, 1567, followed, by, the, arrival, and, government, takeover, by, fernando, lvarez, de, toledo, 3rd, duke, of, alba, simply, known, as, alba, or, alva, with, an, army, of, 10, 000, spanish, and, italian, soldiers, next, an, ill, fated, invasion, by, the, most, powerful, nobleman, of, the, low, countries, the, exiled, but, still, catholic, william, the, silent, of, orange, failed, to, inspire, a, general, anti, government, revolt, although, the, war, seemed, over, before, it, got, underway, in, the, years, 1569, 1571, alba, s, repression, grew, severe, and, opposition, against, his, regime, mounted, to, new, heights, and, became, susceptible, to, rebellion, the, period, between, the, capture, of, brielle, 1, april, 1572, and, the, pacification, of, ghent, 8, november, 1576, was, an, early, stage, of, the, eighty, years, war, c, 1568, 1648, between, the, spanish, empire, and, groups, of, rebels, in, the, habsburg, netherlands, after, watergeuzen, in, english, known, as, sea, beggars, seized, several, poorly, defended, towns, and, cities, in, holland, and, zeeland, in, april, 1572, the, exiled, stadtholder, william, the, silent, of, orange, launched, his, second, invasion, of, the, netherlands, from, the, east, in, another, attempt, to, generate, a, general, uprising, against, the, repressive, regime, of, spanish, general, governor, fernando, lvarez, de, toledo, 3rd, duke, of, alba, acting, on, orders, of, philip, ii, of, spain, alba, sought, to, exterminate, all, manifestations, of, protestantism, and, disobedience, through, inquisition, and, public, executions, as, well, as, abolishing, several, privileges, of, the, netherlandish, nobility, and, autonomy, of, cities, and, introducing, more, stringent, taxes, william, s, second, invasion, in, 1572, had, mixed, results, and, alba, s, son, don, fadrique, went, on, a, lightning, campaign, to, retake, all, towns, occupied, by, orangist, and, geuzen, troops, in, october, 1572, several, towns, including, mechelen, zutphen, and, naarden, which, refused, to, surrender, were, brutally, sacked, by, fadrique, s, forces, in, an, attempt, to, intimidate, others, into, resubmitting, themselves, to, the, royal, government, culminating, in, the, seven, month, long, siege, of, haarlem, before, it, was, conquered, and, sacked, in, july, 1573, by, this, point, the, rebel, territory, had, been, reduced, to, most, towns, in, holland, notably, excluding, royalist, amsterdam, and, zeeland, and, two, towns, in, guelders, knowing, that, violent, repression, would, result, from, resistance, these, cities, resolved, to, fight, to, the, bitter, end, while, the, others, capitulated, the, spanish, offensive, stalled, after, haarlem, with, the, dutch, rebels, capturing, geertruidenberg, winning, the, siege, of, alkmaar, and, battle, of, delft, and, achieving, naval, superiority, citing, ill, health, alba, resigned, and, returned, to, spain, in, december, 1573, the, period, between, the, pacification, of, ghent, 8, november, 1576, and, the, unions, of, arras, 6, january, 1579, and, utrecht, 23, january, 1579, constituted, a, crucial, phase, of, the, eighty, years, war, c, 1568, 1648, between, the, spanish, empire, and, the, rebelling, united, provinces, which, would, become, the, independent, dutch, republic, sometimes, known, as, the, general, revolt, the, period, marked, the, only, time, of, the, war, where, the, states, general, of, all, seventeen, provinces, of, the, habsburg, netherlands, except, luxemburg, were, in, joint, active, political, and, military, rebellion, against, the, spanish, imperial, government, through, the, pacification, of, ghent, the, pacification, formulated, several, agreements, amongst, the, rebellious, provinces, themselves, and, laid, down, their, demands, including, the, immediate, withdrawal, of, foreign, mostly, spanish, italian, and, german, troops, from, the, netherlands, restitution, of, old, rights, and, privileges, and, self, rule, to, king, philip, ii, of, spain, from, 8, november, 1576, until, 23, july, 1577, the, new, spanish, governor, general, of, the, netherlands, john, of, austria, known, to, history, as, don, juan, engaged, in, peace, negotiations, with, the, states, general, the, first, union, of, brussels, 9, january, 1577, confirmed, the, pacification, adding, that, the, states, would, uphold, the, catholic, religion, in, their, provinces, by, signing, the, edict, of, 1577, on, 12, february, 1577, at, marche, en, famenne, don, juan, nominally, accepted, all, demands, of, the, pacification, most, foreign, troops, withdrew, to, the, territory, of, luxemburg, which, had, not, joined, the, pacification, although, a, few, sieges, of, cities, with, spanish, garrisons, that, refused, to, withdraw, took, place, these, were, mostly, resolved, quickly, by, paying, them, off, in, general, the, situation, had, potential, for, putting, an, end, to, the, war, if, agreements, could, be, reached, and, respected, between, the, parties, from, 24, july, 1577, until, 6, january, 1579, starting, with, the, capture, of, the, citadel, of, namur, don, juan, and, his, second, in, command, and, successor, alexander, farnese, duke, of, parma, launched, a, military, offensive, against, the, united, provinces, while, seeking, to, reconcile, provinces, that, were, willing, to, subject, themselves, back, under, the, spanish, royal, government, under, certain, conditions, in, response, the, states, general, s, second, union, of, brussels, 10, december, 1577, showed, a, more, fierce, and, determined, opposition, to, the, spanish, government, now, demanding, and, themselves, guaranteeing, equal, protection, for, catholics, and, protestants, in, all, provinces, of, the, netherlands, william, the, silent, of, orange, became, the, de, facto, political, leader, of, the, united, provinces, while, matthias, of, austria, was, brought, in, to, replace, don, juan, as, governor, general, the, years, 1579, 1588, constituted, a, phase, of, the, eighty, years, war, c, 1568, 1648, between, the, spanish, empire, and, the, united, provinces, in, revolt, after, most, of, them, concluded, the, union, of, utrecht, on, 23, january, 1579, and, proceeded, to, carve, the, independent, dutch, republic, out, of, the, habsburg, netherlands, it, followed, the, 1576, 1579, period, in, which, a, temporary, alliance, of, 16, out, of, the, seventeen, provinces, states, general, established, the, pacification, of, ghent, 8, november, 1576, as, a, joint, catholic, protestant, rebellion, against, the, spanish, government, but, internal, conflicts, as, well, as, military, and, diplomatic, successes, of, the, spanish, governors, general, don, juan, of, austria, and, alexander, farnese, duke, of, parma, split, them, apart, finally, leading, the, malcontent, county, of, artois, county, of, hainaut, and, city, of, douai, to, sign, the, union, of, arras, on, 6, january, 1579, reverting, to, catholicism, and, loyalty, to, the, spanish, crown, in, response, most, of, the, remaining, rebel, provinces, and, cities, would, forge, or, later, accede, to, the, union, of, utrecht, a, closer, military, alliance, treaty, that, would, go, on, to, become, the, most, important, fundamental, law, of, the, united, provinces, who, on, 26, july, 1581, proclaimed, the, act, of, abjuration, a, de, facto, declaration, of, independence, from, spain, while, the, nascent, polity, was, struggling, to, find, a, new, sovereign, head, of, state, including, matthias, of, austria, francis, of, anjou, william, the, silent, of, orange, and, robert, of, leicester, before, giving, up, and, deciding, to, become, a, republic, by, passing, the, deduction, of, vrancken, on, 12, april, 1588, the, duke, of, parma, continued, his, successful, military, and, diplomatic, offensive, bringing, ever, more, provinces, and, cities, in, the, southern, eastern, and, northeastern, parts, of, the, netherlands, back, into, royalist, hands, the, military, upkeep, and, decreased, trade, had, put, both, spain, and, the, dutch, republic, under, financial, strain, to, alleviate, conditions, a, ceasefire, was, signed, in, antwerp, on, 9, april, 1609, marking, the, end, of, the, dutch, revolt, and, the, beginning, of, the, twelve, years, truce, the, conclusion, of, this, truce, was, a, major, diplomatic, coup, for, holland, s, advocate, johan, van, oldenbarnevelt, as, spain, by, concluding, the, treaty, formally, recognised, the, independence, of, the, republic, in, spain, the, truce, was, seen, as, a, major, humiliation, she, had, suffered, a, political, military, and, ideological, defeat, and, the, affront, to, its, prestige, was, immense, the, closure, of, the, river, scheldt, to, traffic, in, and, out, of, antwerp, and, the, acceptance, of, dutch, commercial, operations, in, the, spanish, and, portuguese, colonial, maritime, lanes, were, just, a, few, points, that, the, spanish, found, objectionable, although, there, was, peace, on, an, international, level, political, unrest, took, hold, of, dutch, domestic, affairs, what, had, started, as, a, theological, quarrel, resulted, in, riots, between, remonstrants, arminians, and, counter, remonstrants, gomarists, in, general, regents, would, support, the, former, and, civilians, the, latter, even, the, government, got, involved, with, oldenbarnevelt, taking, the, side, of, the, remonstrants, and, stadtholder, maurice, of, nassau, their, opponents, in, the, end, the, synod, of, dort, condemned, the, remonstrants, for, heresy, and, excommunicated, them, from, the, national, public, church, van, oldenbarnevelt, was, sentenced, to, death, together, with, his, ally, gilles, van, ledenberg, while, two, other, remonstrant, allies, rombout, hogerbeets, and, hugo, grotius, received, life, imprisonment, the, years, 1621, 1648, constituted, the, final, phase, of, the, eighty, years, war, c, 1568, 1648, between, the, spanish, empire, and, the, emerging, dutch, republic, it, began, when, the, twelve, years, truce, 1609, 1621, expired, and, concluded, with, the, peace, of, m, nster, in, 1648, although, the, dutch, and, spanish, were, both, involved, in, opposite, sides, of, the, war, of, the, j, lich, succession, june, 1609, october, 1610, may, october, 1614, in, j, lich, cleves, berg, they, carefully, avoided, each, other, and, thus, the, hostilities, never, spread, back, into, the, habsburg, netherlands, and, the, truce, held, firm, nevertheless, attempts, to, negotiate, a, definitive, peace, also, failed, and, the, war, resumed, as, anticipated, in, 1621, essentially, it, became, a, side, theatre, of, the, wider, thirty, years, war, that, had, already, broken, out, with, the, bohemian, revolt, in, 1618, in, eastern, parts, of, the, holy, roman, empire, bohemia, and, austria, pitting, central, europe, s, protestant, union, against, the, catholic, league, although, the, two, conflicts, never, fully, merged, with, several, back, and, forths, notably, the, spanish, conquered, breda, in, 1625, but, the, dutch, took, it, back, in, 1637, the, dutch, republic, was, able, to, conquer, the, eastern, border, forts, of, oldenzaal, 1626, and, groenlo, 1627, the, major, brabantian, city, of, s, hertogenbosch, 1629, the, fortified, cities, of, venlo, roermond, and, maastricht, along, the, meuse, 1632, and, sas, van, gent, 1644, and, hulst, 1645, in, zeelandic, flanders, nevertheless, peace, talks, in, 1629, 1630, came, to, nothing, more, ambitious, plans, to, conquer, brussels, in, 1632, 1633, with, the, help, of, anti, spanish, nobility, in, the, southern, netherlands, never, came, to, fruition, several, attempted, northern, republican, surprises, and, sieges, of, antwerp, were, parried, by, the, spanish, royal, army, of, flanders, nor, did, the, franco, dutch, alliance, bring, significant, changes, to, the, situation, on, the, ground, it, began, with, a, disastrous, franco, dutch, invasion, of, the, southern, netherlands, in, 1635, this, in, fact, made, matters, worse, for, the, dutch, when, french, and, dutch, troops, sacked, the, city, of, tienen, which, cost, them, the, sympathies, of, the, southern, netherlands, population, however, french, intervention, and, internal, discontent, at, the, costs, of, the, war, in, the, low, countries, led, to, a, change, in, spain, s, netherlands, first, policy, instead, spain, focused, on, suppressing, the, french, backed, reapers, war, in, catalonia, the, resulting, stalemate, and, financial, troubles, plus, spanish, military, exhaustion, and, dutch, desire, for, formal, political, recognition, eventually, convinced, both, sides, in, the, mid, 1640s, to, hold, peace, talks, the, negotiations, between, spain, and, the, republic, formally, started, in, january, 1646, as, part, of, the, more, general, peace, negotiations, between, the, warring, parties, in, the, thirty, years, war, the, states, general, sent, eight, delegates, from, several, of, the, provinces, as, none, trusted, the, others, to, represent, them, adequately, they, were, willem, van, ripperda, overijssel, frans, van, donia, friesland, adriaen, clant, tot, stedum, groningen, adriaan, pauw, and, jan, van, mathenesse, holland, barthold, van, gent, gelderland, johan, de, knuyt, zeeland, and, godert, van, reede, utrecht, the, spanish, delegation, was, led, by, gaspar, de, bracamonte, 3rd, count, of, pe, aranda, the, negotiations, were, held, in, what, is, now, the, haus, der, niederlande, in, m, nster, the, dutch, and, spanish, delegations, soon, reached, an, agreement, based, on, the, text, of, the, twelve, years, truce, it, therefore, confirmed, spain, s, recognition, of, dutch, independence, the, dutch, demands, closure, of, the, scheldt, cession, of, the, meierij, formal, cession, of, dutch, conquests, in, the, indies, and, americas, and, lifting, of, the, spanish, embargoes, were, generally, met, however, the, general, negotiations, between, the, main, parties, dragged, on, because, france, kept, formulating, new, demands, eventually, it, was, decided, therefore, to, split, off, the, peace, between, the, republic, and, spain, from, the, general, peace, negotiations, this, enabled, the, two, parties, to, conclude, what, technically, was, a, separate, peace, to, the, annoyance, of, france, which, maintained, that, this, contravened, the, alliance, treaty, of, 1635, with, the, republic, the, text, of, the, treaty, in, 79, articles, was, fixed, on, 30, january, 1648, it, was, then, sent, to, the, principals, king, philip, iv, of, spain, and, the, states, general, for, ratification, five, provinces, voted, to, ratify, against, the, advice, of, stadtholder, william, on, 4, april, zeeland, and, utrecht, being, opposed, utrecht, finally, yielded, to, pressure, by, the, other, provinces, but, zeeland, held, out, and, refused, to, sign, it, was, eventually, decided, to, ratify, the, peace, without, zeeland, s, consent, the, delegates, to, the, peace, conference, affirmed, the, peace, on, oath, on, 15, may, 1648, though, the, delegate, of, zeeland, refused, to, attend, and, the, delegate, of, utrecht, suffered, a, possibly, diplomatic, illness, in, the, broader, context, of, the, treaties, between, france, and, the, holy, roman, empire, and, sweden, and, the, holy, roman, empire, of, 14, and, 24, october, 1648, which, comprise, the, peace, of, westphalia, but, which, were, not, signed, by, the, republic, the, republic, now, also, gained, formal, independence, from, the, holy, roman, empire, just, like, the, swiss, cantons, in, both, cases, this, was, just, a, formalisation, of, a, situation, that, had, already, existed, for, a, long, time, france, and, spain, did, not, conclude, a, treaty, and, so, remained, at, war, until, the, peace, of, the, pyrenees, of, 1659, the, peace, was, celebrated, in, the, republic, with, sumptuous, festivities, it, was, solemnly, promulgated, on, the, 80th, anniversary, of, the, execution, of, the, counts, of, egmont, and, horne, on, 5, june, 1648, the, eighty, years, war, has, given, rise, to, more, historical, controversies, than, any, other, topic, from, the, history, of, the, nederlanden, whatsoever, encarta, encyclopedie, winkler, prins, 2002
