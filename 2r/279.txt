the, byzantine, empire, also, referred, to, as, the, eastern, roman, empire, was, the, continuation, of, the, roman, empire, centred, in, constantinople, during, late, antiquity, and, the, middle, ages, the, eastern, half, of, the, empire, survived, the, conditions, that, caused, the, fall, of, the, west, in, the, 5th, century, ad, and, continued, to, exist, until, the, fall, of, constantinople, to, the, ottoman, empire, in, 1453, during, most, of, its, existence, the, empire, remained, the, most, powerful, economic, cultural, and, military, force, in, the, mediterranean, world, the, term, byzantine, empire, was, only, coined, following, the, empire, s, demise, its, citizens, referred, to, the, polity, as, the, roman, empire, and, to, themselves, as, romans, due, to, the, imperial, seat, s, move, from, rome, to, byzantium, the, adoption, of, state, christianity, and, the, predominance, of, greek, instead, of, latin, modern, historians, continue, to, make, a, distinction, between, the, earlier, roman, empire, and, the, later, byzantine, empire, during, the, earlier, pax, romana, period, the, western, parts, of, the, empire, became, increasingly, latinised, while, the, eastern, parts, largely, retained, their, preexisting, hellenistic, culture, this, created, a, dichotomy, between, the, greek, east, and, latin, west, these, cultural, spheres, continued, to, diverge, after, constantine, i, r, 324, 337, moved, the, capital, to, constantinople, and, legalised, christianity, under, theodosius, i, r, 379, 395, christianity, became, the, state, religion, and, other, religious, practices, were, proscribed, greek, gradually, replaced, latin, for, official, use, as, latin, fell, into, disuse, the, empire, experienced, several, cycles, of, decline, and, recovery, throughout, its, history, reaching, its, greatest, extent, after, the, fall, of, the, west, during, the, reign, of, justinian, i, r, 527, 565, who, briefly, reconquered, much, of, italy, and, the, western, mediterranean, coast, the, appearance, of, plague, and, a, devastating, war, with, persia, exhausted, the, empire, s, resources, the, early, muslim, conquests, that, followed, saw, the, loss, of, the, empire, s, richest, provinces, egypt, and, syria, to, the, rashidun, caliphate, in, 698, africa, was, lost, to, the, umayyad, caliphate, but, the, empire, subsequently, stabilised, under, the, isaurian, dynasty, the, empire, was, able, to, expand, once, more, under, the, macedonian, dynasty, experiencing, a, two, century, long, renaissance, this, came, to, an, end, in, 1071, with, the, defeat, by, the, seljuk, turks, at, the, battle, of, manzikert, thereafter, periods, of, civil, war, and, seljuk, incursion, resulted, in, the, loss, of, most, of, asia, minor, the, empire, recovered, during, the, komnenian, restoration, and, constantinople, would, remain, the, largest, and, wealthiest, city, in, europe, until, the, 13th, century, the, empire, was, largely, dismantled, in, 1204, following, the, sack, of, constantinople, by, latin, armies, at, the, end, of, the, fourth, crusade, its, former, territories, were, then, divided, into, competing, greek, rump, states, and, latin, realms, despite, the, eventual, recovery, of, constantinople, in, 1261, the, reconstituted, empire, would, wield, only, regional, power, during, its, final, two, centuries, of, existence, its, remaining, territories, were, progressively, annexed, by, the, ottomans, in, perennial, wars, fought, throughout, the, 14th, and, 15th, centuries, the, fall, of, constantinople, to, the, ottomans, in, 1453, ultimately, brought, the, empire, to, an, end, many, refugees, who, had, fled, the, city, after, its, capture, settled, in, italy, and, throughout, europe, helping, to, ignite, the, renaissance, the, fall, of, constantinople, is, sometimes, used, to, mark, the, dividing, line, between, the, middle, ages, and, the, early, modern, period, the, inhabitants, of, the, empire, now, generally, termed, byzantines, thought, of, themselves, as, romans, romaioi, their, islamic, neighbours, similarly, called, their, empire, the, land, of, the, romans, bil, d, al, r, m, but, the, people, of, medieval, western, europe, preferred, to, call, them, greeks, graeci, due, to, having, a, contested, legacy, to, roman, identity, and, to, associate, negative, connotations, from, ancient, latin, literature, the, adjective, byzantine, which, derived, from, byzantion, latinised, as, byzantium, the, name, of, the, greek, settlement, constantinople, was, established, on, was, only, used, to, describe, the, inhabitants, of, that, city, it, did, not, refer, to, the, empire, which, they, called, roman, a, romanland, after, the, empire, s, fall, early, modern, scholars, referred, to, the, empire, by, many, names, including, the, empire, of, constantinople, the, empire, of, the, greeks, the, eastern, empire, the, late, empire, the, low, empire, and, the, roman, empire, the, increasing, use, of, byzantine, and, byzantine, empire, likely, started, with, the, 15th, century, historian, laonikos, chalkokondyles, whose, works, were, widely, propagated, including, by, hieronymus, wolf, byzantine, was, used, adjectivally, alongside, terms, such, as, empire, of, the, greeks, until, the, 19th, century, it, is, now, the, primary, term, used, to, refer, to, all, aspects, of, the, empire, some, modern, historians, believe, that, as, an, originally, prejudicial, and, inaccurate, term, its, use, should, be, halted, as, the, historiographical, periodizations, of, roman, history, late, antiquity, and, byzantine, history, significantly, overlap, there, is, no, consensus, on, a, foundation, date, for, the, byzantine, empire, if, there, was, one, at, all, the, growth, of, the, study, of, late, antiquity, has, led, to, some, historians, setting, a, start, date, in, the, seventh, or, eighth, centuries, others, believe, a, new, empire, began, during, changes, in, c, 300, ad, still, others, hold, that, these, starting, points, are, too, early, or, too, late, and, instead, begin, c, 500, geoffrey, greatrex, believes, that, it, is, impossible, to, precisely, date, the, foundation, of, the, byzantine, empire, in, a, series, of, conflicts, between, the, third, and, first, centuries, bc, the, roman, republic, gradually, established, hegemony, over, the, eastern, mediterranean, while, its, government, ultimately, transformed, into, the, one, person, rule, of, an, emperor, the, roman, empire, enjoyed, a, period, of, relative, stability, until, the, third, century, ad, when, a, combination, of, external, threats, and, internal, instabilities, caused, the, roman, state, to, splinter, as, regional, armies, acclaimed, their, generals, as, soldier, emperors, one, of, these, diocletian, r, 284, 305, seeing, that, the, state, was, too, big, to, be, ruled, by, one, man, attempted, to, fix, the, problem, by, instituting, a, tetrarchy, or, rule, of, four, and, dividing, the, empire, into, eastern, and, western, halves, although, the, tetrarchy, system, quickly, failed, the, division, of, the, empire, proved, an, enduring, concept, constantine, i, r, 306, 337, secured, sole, power, in, 324, over, the, following, six, years, he, rebuilt, the, city, of, byzantium, as, a, capital, city, which, was, renamed, constantinople, rome, the, previous, capital, was, further, from, the, important, eastern, provinces, and, in, a, less, strategically, important, location, it, was, not, esteemed, by, the, soldier, emperors, who, ruled, from, the, frontiers, or, by, the, empire, s, population, who, having, been, granted, citizenship, considered, themselves, roman, constantine, extensively, reformed, the, empire, s, military, and, civil, administration, and, instituted, the, gold, solidus, as, a, stable, currency, he, favoured, christianity, which, he, had, converted, to, in, 312, constantine, s, dynasty, fought, a, lengthy, conflict, against, sasanid, persia, and, ended, in, 363, with, the, death, of, his, son, in, law, julian, the, short, valentinianic, dynasty, occupied, with, wars, against, barbarians, religious, debates, and, anti, corruption, campaigns, ended, in, the, east, with, the, death, of, valens, at, the, battle, of, adrianople, in, 378, valens, s, successor, theodosius, i, r, 379, 395, restored, political, stability, in, the, east, by, allowing, the, goths, to, settle, in, roman, territory, he, also, twice, intervened, in, the, western, half, defeating, the, usurpers, magnus, maximus, and, eugenius, in, 388, and, 394, respectively, he, actively, condemned, paganism, confirmed, the, primacy, of, nicene, christianity, over, arianism, and, established, christianity, as, the, roman, state, religion, he, was, the, last, emperor, to, rule, both, the, western, and, eastern, halves, of, the, empire, after, his, death, the, west, would, be, destabilised, by, a, succession, of, soldier, emperors, unlike, the, east, where, administrators, would, continue, to, hold, power, theodosius, ii, r, 408, 450, largely, left, the, rule, of, the, east, to, officials, such, as, anthemius, who, constructed, the, theodosian, walls, to, defend, constantinople, now, firmly, entrenched, as, rome, s, capital, theodosius, reign, was, marked, by, the, theological, dispute, over, nestorianism, which, was, eventually, deemed, heretical, and, by, the, formulation, of, the, codex, theodosianus, law, code, it, also, saw, the, arrival, of, attila, s, huns, who, ravaged, the, balkans, and, exacted, a, massive, tribute, from, the, empire, attilla, however, switched, his, attention, to, the, rapidly, deteriorating, western, empire, and, his, people, fractured, after, his, death, in, 453, after, leo, i, r, 457, 474, failed, in, his, 468, attempt, to, reconquer, the, west, the, warlord, odoacer, deposed, romulus, augustulus, in, 476, killed, his, titular, successor, julius, nepos, in, 480, and, the, office, of, western, emperor, was, formally, abolished, through, a, combination, of, luck, cultural, factors, and, political, decisions, the, eastern, empire, never, suffered, from, rebellious, barbarian, vassals, and, was, never, ruled, by, barbarian, warlords, the, problems, which, ensured, the, downfall, of, the, west, zeno, r, 474, 491, convinced, the, problematic, ostrogoth, king, theodoric, to, take, control, of, italy, from, odoacer, which, he, did, dying, with, the, empire, at, peace, zeno, was, succeeded, by, anastasius, i, r, 491, 518, although, his, monophysitism, brought, occasional, issues, anastasius, was, a, capable, administrator, and, instituted, several, successful, financial, reforms, including, the, abolition, of, the, chrysargyron, tax, he, was, the, first, emperor, to, die, with, no, serious, problems, affecting, his, empire, since, diocletian, the, reign, of, justinian, i, was, a, watershed, in, byzantine, history, following, his, accession, in, 527, the, law, code, was, rewritten, as, the, influential, corpus, juris, civilis, and, justinian, produced, extensive, legislation, on, provincial, administration, he, reasserted, imperial, control, over, religion, and, morality, through, purges, of, non, christians, and, deviants, and, having, ruthlessly, subdued, the, 532, nika, revolt, he, rebuilt, much, of, constantinople, including, the, original, hagia, sophia, justinian, took, advantage, of, political, instability, in, italy, to, attempt, the, reconquest, of, lost, western, territories, the, vandal, kingdom, in, north, africa, was, subjugated, in, 534, by, the, general, belisarius, who, then, invaded, italy, the, ostrogothic, kingdom, was, destroyed, in, 554, in, the, 540s, however, justinian, began, to, suffer, reversals, on, multiple, fronts, taking, advantage, of, constantinople, s, preoccupation, with, the, west, khosrow, i, of, the, sasanian, empire, invaded, byzantine, territory, and, sacked, antioch, in, 540, meanwhile, the, emperor, s, internal, reforms, and, policies, began, to, falter, not, helped, by, a, devastating, plague, that, killed, a, large, proportion, of, the, population, and, severely, weakened, the, empire, s, social, and, financial, stability, the, most, difficult, period, of, the, ostrogothic, war, against, their, king, totila, came, during, this, decade, while, divisions, among, justinian, s, advisors, undercut, the, administration, s, response, he, also, did, not, fully, heal, the, divisions, in, chalcedonian, christianity, as, the, second, council, of, constantinople, failed, to, make, a, real, difference, justinian, died, in, 565, his, reign, saw, more, success, than, that, of, any, other, byzantine, emperor, yet, he, left, his, empire, under, massive, strain, financially, and, territorially, overextended, justin, ii, r, 565, 578, was, soon, at, war, on, many, fronts, the, lombards, fearing, the, aggressive, avars, conquered, much, of, northern, italy, by, 572, the, sasanian, wars, restarted, that, year, and, continued, until, the, emperor, maurice, finally, emerged, victorious, in, 591, by, that, time, the, avars, and, slavs, had, repeatedly, invaded, the, balkans, causing, great, instability, maurice, campaigned, extensively, in, the, region, during, the, 590s, but, although, he, managed, to, re, establish, byzantine, control, up, to, the, danube, he, pushed, his, troops, too, far, in, 602, they, mutinied, proclaimed, an, officer, named, phocas, as, emperor, and, executed, maurice, the, sasanians, seized, their, moment, and, reopened, hostilities, phocas, was, unable, to, cope, and, soon, faced, a, major, rebellion, led, by, heraclius, phocas, lost, constantinople, in, 610, and, was, soon, executed, but, the, destructive, civil, war, accelerated, the, empire, s, decline, under, khosrow, ii, the, sassanids, occupied, the, levant, and, egypt, and, pushed, into, asia, minor, while, byzantine, control, of, italy, slipped, and, the, avars, and, slavs, ran, riot, in, the, balkans, although, heraclius, repelled, a, siege, of, constantinople, in, 626, and, defeated, the, sassanids, in, 627, this, was, a, pyrrhic, victory, the, early, muslim, conquests, soon, saw, the, conquest, of, the, levant, of, egypt, and, of, the, sassanid, empire, by, the, newly, formed, arabic, rashidun, caliphate, by, heraclius, death, in, 641, the, empire, had, been, severely, reduced, economically, as, well, as, territorially, the, loss, of, the, wealthy, eastern, provinces, had, deprived, constantinople, of, three, quarters, of, its, revenue, the, next, seventy, five, years, are, poorly, documented, arab, raids, into, asia, minor, began, almost, immediately, and, the, byzantines, resorted, to, holding, fortified, centres, and, avoiding, battle, at, all, costs, although, it, was, invaded, annually, anatolia, avoided, permanent, arab, occupation, the, outbreak, of, the, first, fitna, in, 656, gave, byzantium, breathing, space, which, it, used, wisely, some, order, was, restored, in, the, balkans, by, constans, ii, r, 641, 668, who, began, the, administrative, reorganisation, known, as, the, theme, system, in, which, troops, were, allocated, to, defend, specific, provinces, with, the, help, of, the, recently, rediscovered, greek, fire, constantine, iv, r, 668, 685, repelled, the, arab, efforts, to, capture, constantinople, in, the, 670s, but, suffered, a, reversal, against, the, bulgars, who, soon, established, an, empire, in, the, northern, balkans, nevertheless, he, and, constans, had, done, enough, to, secure, the, empire, s, position, especially, as, the, umayyad, caliphate, was, undergoing, another, civil, war, justinian, ii, sought, to, build, on, the, stability, secured, by, his, father, constantine, but, was, overthrown, in, 695, after, attempting, to, exact, too, much, from, his, subjects, over, the, next, twenty, two, years, six, more, rebellions, followed, in, an, era, of, political, instability, the, reconstituted, caliphate, sought, to, break, byzantium, by, taking, constantinople, but, the, newly, crowned, leo, iii, managed, to, repel, the, 717, 718, siege, the, first, major, setback, of, the, muslim, conquests, leo, and, his, son, constantine, v, r, 741, 775, two, of, the, most, capable, byzantine, emperors, withstood, continued, arab, attacks, civil, unrest, and, natural, disasters, and, reestablished, the, state, as, a, major, regional, power, leo, s, reign, produced, the, ecloga, a, new, code, of, law, to, succeed, that, of, justinian, ii, and, continued, to, reform, the, theme, system, in, order, to, lead, offensive, campaigns, against, the, muslims, culminating, in, a, decisive, victory, in, 740, constantine, overcame, an, early, civil, war, against, his, brother, in, law, artabasdos, made, peace, with, the, new, abbasid, caliphate, campaigned, successfully, against, the, bulgars, and, continued, to, make, administrative, and, military, reforms, however, due, to, both, emperors, support, for, the, byzantine, iconoclasm, which, opposed, the, use, of, religious, icons, they, were, later, vilified, by, byzantine, historians, constantine, s, reign, also, saw, the, loss, of, ravenna, to, the, lombards, and, the, beginning, of, a, split, with, the, roman, papacy, in, 780, empress, irene, assumed, power, on, behalf, of, her, son, constantine, vi, although, she, was, a, capable, administrator, who, temporarily, resolved, the, iconoclasm, controversy, the, empire, was, destabilized, by, her, feud, with, her, son, the, bulgars, and, abbasids, meanwhile, inflicted, numerous, defeats, on, the, byzantine, armies, and, the, papacy, crowned, charlemagne, as, roman, emperor, in, 800, in, 802, the, unpopular, irene, was, overthrown, by, nikephoros, i, he, reformed, the, empire, s, administration, but, died, in, battle, against, the, bulgars, in, 811, military, defeats, and, societal, disorder, especially, the, resurgence, of, iconoclasm, characterised, the, next, eighteen, years, stability, was, somewhat, restored, during, the, reign, of, theophilos, r, 829, 842, who, exploited, economic, growth, to, complete, construction, programs, including, rebuilding, the, sea, walls, of, constantinople, overhaul, provincial, governance, and, wage, inconclusive, campaigns, against, the, abbasids, after, his, death, his, empress, theodora, ruling, on, behalf, of, her, son, michael, iii, permanently, extinguished, the, iconoclastic, movement, the, empire, prospered, under, their, sometimes, fraught, rule, however, michael, was, posthumously, vilified, by, historians, loyal, to, the, dynasty, of, his, successor, basil, i, who, assassinated, him, in, 867, and, who, was, given, credit, for, his, predecessor, s, achievements, basil, i, r, 867, 886, continued, michael, s, policies, his, armies, campaigned, with, mixed, results, in, italy, but, defeated, the, paulicians, of, tephrike, his, successor, leo, vi, r, 886, 912, compiled, and, propagated, a, huge, number, of, written, works, these, included, the, basilika, a, greek, translation, of, justinian, i, s, law, code, which, included, over, 100, new, laws, of, leo, s, devising, the, tactica, a, military, treatise, and, the, book, of, the, eparch, which, codified, constantinople, s, trading, regulations, in, non, literary, contexts, leo, was, less, successful, the, empire, lost, in, sicily, and, against, the, bulgarians, while, he, provoked, theological, scandal, by, marrying, four, times, in, an, attempt, to, father, a, legitimate, heir, the, early, reign, of, leo, s, young, heir, constantine, vii, was, tumultuous, as, his, mother, zoe, the, patriarch, nicholas, the, powerful, simeon, i, of, bulgaria, and, other, influential, figures, jockeyed, for, power, in, 920, the, admiral, romanos, i, used, his, fleet, to, secure, power, crowning, himself, and, demoting, constantine, to, the, position, of, junior, co, emperor, between, 1021, and, 1022, following, years, of, tensions, basil, ii, led, a, series, of, victorious, campaigns, against, the, kingdom, of, georgia, resulting, in, the, annexation, of, several, georgian, provinces, to, the, empire, basil, s, successors, also, annexed, bagratid, armenia, in, 1045, importantly, both, georgia, and, armenia, were, significantly, weakened, by, the, byzantine, administration, s, policy, of, heavy, taxation, and, abolishing, of, the, levy, the, weakening, of, georgia, and, armenia, played, a, significant, role, in, the, byzantine, defeat, at, manzikert, in, 1071, basil, ii, is, considered, among, the, most, capable, byzantine, emperors, and, his, reign, as, the, apex, of, the, empire, in, the, middle, ages, by, 1025, the, date, of, basil, ii, s, death, the, byzantine, empire, stretched, from, armenia, in, the, east, to, calabria, in, southern, italy, in, the, west, many, successes, had, been, achieved, ranging, from, the, conquest, of, bulgaria, to, the, annexation, of, parts, of, georgia, and, armenia, and, the, reconquests, of, crete, cyprus, and, the, important, city, of, antioch, these, were, not, temporary, tactical, gains, but, long, term, reconquests, the, byzantine, empire, then, fell, into, a, period, of, difficulties, caused, to, a, large, extent, by, the, undermining, of, the, theme, system, and, the, neglect, of, the, military, nikephoros, ii, john, tzimiskes, and, basil, ii, shifted, the, emphasis, of, the, military, divisions, tagmata, from, a, reactive, defence, oriented, citizen, army, into, an, army, of, professional, career, soldiers, increasingly, dependent, on, foreign, mercenaries, mercenaries, were, expensive, however, and, as, the, threat, of, invasion, receded, in, the, 10th, century, so, did, the, need, for, maintaining, large, garrisons, and, expensive, fortifications, basil, ii, left, a, burgeoning, treasury, upon, his, death, but, he, neglected, to, plan, for, his, succession, none, of, his, immediate, successors, had, any, particular, military, or, political, talent, and, the, imperial, administration, increasingly, fell, into, the, hands, of, the, civil, service, incompetent, efforts, to, revive, the, byzantine, economy, resulted, in, severe, inflation, and, a, debased, gold, currency, the, army, was, seen, as, both, an, unnecessary, expense, and, a, political, threat, several, standing, local, units, were, demobilised, further, augmenting, the, army, s, dependence, on, mercenaries, who, could, be, retained, and, dismissed, on, an, as, needed, basis, at, the, same, time, byzantium, was, faced, with, new, enemies, its, provinces, in, southern, italy, were, threatened, by, the, normans, who, arrived, in, italy, at, the, beginning, of, the, 11th, century, during, a, period, of, strife, between, constantinople, and, rome, culminating, in, the, east, west, schism, of, 1054, the, normans, advanced, gradually, into, byzantine, italy, reggio, the, capital, of, the, tagma, of, calabria, was, captured, in, 1060, by, robert, guiscard, followed, by, otranto, in, 1068, bari, the, main, byzantine, stronghold, in, apulia, was, besieged, in, august, 1068, and, fell, in, april, 1071, about, 1053, constantine, ix, disbanded, what, the, historian, john, skylitzes, calls, the, iberian, army, which, consisted, of, 50, 000, men, and, it, was, turned, into, a, contemporary, drungary, of, the, watch, two, other, knowledgeable, contemporaries, the, former, officials, michael, attaleiates, and, kekaumenos, agree, with, skylitzes, that, by, demobilising, these, soldiers, constantine, did, catastrophic, harm, to, the, empire, s, eastern, defences, the, emergency, lent, weight, to, the, military, aristocracy, in, anatolia, who, in, 1068, secured, the, election, of, one, of, their, own, romanos, diogenes, as, emperor, in, the, summer, of, 1071, romanos, undertook, a, massive, eastern, campaign, to, draw, the, seljuks, into, a, general, engagement, with, the, byzantine, army, at, the,

expanded, their, rule, over, virtually, the, entire, anatolian, plateau, from, armenia, in, the, east, to, bithynia, in, the, west, and, had, established, their, capital, at, nicaea, just, 90,

from, the, normans, under, guiscard, and, his, son, bohemund, of, taranto, who, captured, dyrrhachium, and, corfu, and, laid, siege, to, larissa, in, thessaly, guiscard, s, death, in, 1085,

the, severe, economic, difficulties, and, the, disintegration, of, the, empire, s, traditional, defences, however, he, still, did, not, have, enough, manpower, to, recover, the, lost, territories, in, asia, minor, and, to, the, advance, by, the, seljuks, at, the, council, of, piacenza, in, 1095, envoys, from, alexios, spoke, to, pope, urban, ii, about, the, suffering, of, the, christians, of, the, east, and, underscored, that, without, help, from, the, west, they, would, continue, to, suffer, under, muslim, rule, urban, saw, alexios, request, as, a, dual, opportunity, to, cement, western, europe, and, reunite, the, eastern, orthodox, church, with, the, roman, catholic, church, under, his, rule, on, 27, november, 1095, urban, called, the, council, of, clermont, and, urged, all, those, present, to, take, up, arms, under, the, sign, of, the, cross, and, launch, an, armed, pilgrimage, to, recover, jerusalem, and, the, east, from, the, muslims, the, response, in, western, europe, was, overwhelming, alexios, was, able, to, recover, a, number, of, important, cities, islands, and, much, of, western, asia, minor, the, crusaders, agreed, to, become, alexios, vassals, under, the, treaty, of, devol, in, 1108, which, marked, the, end, of, the, norman, threat, during, alexios, reign, alexios, s, son, john, ii, komnenos, succeeded, him, in, 1118, and, ruled, until, 1143, john, was, a, pious, and, dedicated, emperor, who, was, determined, to, undo, the, damage, to, the, empire, suffered, at, the, battle, of, manzikert, half, a, century, earlier, famed, for, his, piety, and, his, remarkably, mild, and, just, reign, john, was, an, exceptional, example, of, a, moral, ruler, at, a, time, when, cruelty, was, the, norm, for, this, reason, he, has, been, called, the, byzantine, marcus, aurelius, during, his, twenty, five, year, reign, john, made, alliances, with, the, holy, roman, empire, in, the, west, and, decisively, defeated, the, pechenegs, at, the, battle, of, beroia, he, thwarted, hungarian, and, serbian, threats, during, the, 1120s, and, in, 1130, he, allied, himself, with, lothair, iii, the, german, emperor, against, the, norman, king, roger, ii, of, sicily, in, the, later, part, of, his, reign, john, focused, his, activities, on, the, east, personally, leading, numerous, campaigns, against, the, turks, in, asia, minor, his, campaigns, fundamentally, altered, the, balance, of, power, in, the, east, forcing, the, turks, onto, the, defensive, while, retaking, many, towns, fortresses, and, cities, across, the, peninsula, for, the, byzantines, he, defeated, the, danishmend, emirate, of, melitene, and, reconquered, all, of, cilicia, while, forcing, raymond, of, poitiers, prince, of, antioch, to, recognise, byzantine, suzerainty, in, an, effort, to, demonstrate, the, emperor, s, role, as, the, leader, of, the, christian, world, john, marched, into, the, holy, land, at, the, head, of, the, combined, forces, of, the, empire, and, the, crusader, states, yet, despite, his, efforts, in, leading, the, campaign, his, hopes, were, disappointed, by, the, treachery, of, his, crusader, allies, in, 1142, john, returned, to, press, his, claims, to, antioch, but, he, died, in, the, spring, of, 1143, following, a, hunting, accident, john, s, chosen, heir, was, his, fourth, son, manuel, i, komnenos, who, campaigned, aggressively, against, his, neighbours, both, in, the, west, and, east, in, palestine, manuel, allied, with, the, crusader, kingdom, of, jerusalem, and, sent, a, large, fleet, to, participate, in, a, combined, invasion, of, fatimid, egypt, manuel, reinforced, his, position, as, overlord, of, the, crusader, states, with, his, hegemony, over, antioch, and, jerusalem, secured, by, agreement, with, raynald, prince, of, antioch, and, amalric, of, jerusalem, in, an, effort, to, restore, byzantine, control, over, the, ports, of, southern, italy, he, sent, an, expedition, to, italy, in, 1155, but, disputes, within, the, coalition, led, to, the, eventual, failure, of, the, campaign, despite, this, military, setback, manuel, s, armies, successfully, invaded, the, southern, parts, of, the, kingdom, of, hungary, in, 1167, defeating, the, hungarians, at, the, battle, of, sirmium, by, 1168, nearly, the, whole, of, the, eastern, adriatic, coast, lay, in, manuel, s, hands, manuel, made, several, alliances, with, the, pope, and, western, christian, kingdoms, and, he, successfully, handled, the, passage, of, the, crusaders, through, his, empire, in, the, east, manuel, suffered, a, major, defeat, in, 1176, at, the, battle, of, myriokephalon, against, the, turks, these, losses, were, quickly, recovered, and, in, the, following, year, manuel, s, forces, inflicted, a, defeat, upon, a, force, of, picked, turks, the, byzantine, commander, john, vatatzes, who, destroyed, the, turkish, invaders, at, the, battle, of, hyelion, and, leimocheir, brought, troops, from, the, capital, and, was, able, to, gather, an, army, along, the, way, a, sign, that, the, byzantine, army, remained, strong, and, that, the, defensive, program, of, western, asia, minor, was, still, successful, john, and, manuel, pursued, active, military, policies, and, both, deployed, considerable, resources, on, sieges, and, city, defences, aggressive, fortification, policies, were, at, the, heart, of, their, imperial, military, policies, despite, the, defeat, at, myriokephalon, the, policies, of, alexios, john, and, manuel, resulted, in, vast, territorial, gains, increased, frontier, stability, in, asia, minor, and, secured, the, stabilisation, of, the, empire, s, european, frontiers, from, c, 1081, to, c, 1180, the, komnenian, army, assured, the, empire, s, security, enabling, byzantine, civilisation, to, flourish, this, allowed, the, western, provinces, to, achieve, an, economic, revival, that, continued, until, the, close, of, the, century, it, has, been, argued, that, byzantium, under, the, komnenian, rule, was, more, prosperous, than, at, any, time, since, the, persian, invasions, of, the, 7th, century, during, the, 12th, century, population, levels, rose, and, extensive, tracts, of, new, agricultural, land, were, brought, into, production, archaeological, evidence, from, both, europe, and, asia, minor, shows, a, considerable, increase, in, the, size, of, urban, settlements, together, with, a, notable, upsurge, in, new, towns, trade, was, also, flourishing, the, venetians, the, genoese, and, others, opened, up, the, ports, of, the, aegean, to, commerce, shipping, goods, from, the, crusader, states, and, fatimid, egypt, to, the, west, and, trading, with, the, empire, via, constantinople, manuel, s, death, on, 24, september, 1180, left, his, 11, year, old, son, alexios, ii, komnenos, on, the, throne, alexios, was, highly, incompetent, in, the, office, and, with, his, mother, maria, of, antioch, s, frankish, background, his, regency, was, unpopular, eventually, andronikos, i, komnenos, a, grandson, of, alexios, i, overthrew, alexios, ii, in, a, violent, coup, d, tat, after, eliminating, his, potential, rivals, he, had, himself, crowned, as, co, emperor, in, september, 1183, he, eliminated, alexios, ii, and, took, his, 12, year, old, wife, agnes, of, france, for, himself, andronikos, began, his, reign, well, in, particular, the, measures, he, took, to, reform, the, government, of, the, empire, have, been, praised, by, historians, according, to, the, historian, george, ostrogorsky, andronikos, was, determined, to, root, out, corruption, under, his, rule, the, sale, of, offices, ceased, selection, was, based, on, merit, rather, than, favouritism, and, officials, were, paid, an, adequate, salary, to, reduce, the, temptation, of, bribery, in, the, provinces, andronikos, s, reforms, produced, a, speedy, and, marked, improvement, gradually, however, andronikos, s, reign, deteriorated, the, aristocrats, were, infuriated, against, him, and, to, make, matters, worse, andronikos, seemed, to, have, become, increasingly, unbalanced, executions, and, violence, became, increasingly, common, and, his, reign, turned, into, a, reign, of, terror, andronikos, seemed, almost, to, seek, the, extermination, of, the, aristocracy, as, a, whole, the, struggle, against, the, aristocracy, turned, into, wholesale, slaughter, while, the, emperor, resorted, to, ever, more, ruthless, measures, to, shore, up, his, regime, despite, his, military, background, andronikos, failed, to, deal, with, isaac, komnenos, of, cyprus, b, la, iii, of, hungary, who, reincorporated, croatian, territories, into, hungary, and, stephen, nemanja, of, serbia, who, declared, his, independence, from, the, byzantine, empire, yet, none, of, these, troubles, compared, to, william, ii, of, sicily, s, invasion, force, of, 300, ships, and, 80, 000, men, arriving, in, 1185, and, sacking, thessalonica, andronikos, mobilised, a, small, fleet, of, 100, ships, to, defend, the, capital, but, other, than, that, he, was, indifferent, to, the, populace, he, was, finally, overthrown, when, isaac, ii, angelos, surviving, an, imperial, assassination, attempt, seized, power, with, the, aid, of, the, people, and, had, andronikos, killed, the, reign, of, isaac, ii, and, more, so, that, of, his, brother, alexios, iii, saw, the, collapse, of, what, remained, of, the, centralised, machinery, of, byzantine, government, and, defence, although, the, normans, were, driven, out, of, greece, in, 1186, the, vlachs, and, bulgars, began, a, rebellion, that, led, to, the, formation, of, the, second, bulgarian, empire, the, internal, policy, of, the, angeloi, was, characterised, by, the, squandering, of, the, public, treasure, and, fiscal, maladministration, imperial, authority, was, severely, weakened, and, the, growing, power, vacuum, at, the, centre, of, the, empire, encouraged, fragmentation, there, is, evidence, that, some, komnenian, heirs, had, set, up, a, semi, independent, state, in, trebizond, before, 1204, according, to, alexander, vasiliev, the, dynasty, of, the, angeloi, greek, in, its, origin, accelerated, the, ruin, of, the, empire, already, weakened, without, and, disunited, within, in, 1198, pope, innocent, iii, broached, the, subject, of, a, new, crusade, through, legates, and, encyclical, letters, the, stated, intent, of, the, crusade, was, to, conquer, egypt, the, centre, of, muslim, power, in, the, levant, the, crusader, army, arrived, at, venice, in, the, summer, of, 1202, and, hired, the, venetian, fleet, to, transport, them, to, egypt, as, a, payment, to, the, venetians, they, captured, the, christian, port, of, zara, in, dalmatia, which, was, a, vassal, city, of, venice, it, had, rebelled, and, placed, itself, under, hungary, s, protection, in, 1186, shortly, afterward, alexios, iv, angelos, son, of, the, deposed, and, blinded, emperor, isaac, ii, made, contact, with, the, crusaders, alexios, offered, to, reunite, the, byzantine, church, with, rome, pay, the, crusaders, 200, 000, silver, marks, join, the, crusade, and, provide, all, the, supplies, they, needed, to, reach, egypt, the, crusaders, arrived, at, constantinople, in, the, summer, of, 1203, and, quickly, attacked, starting, a, major, fire, that, damaged, large, parts, of, the, city, and, briefly, seized, control, alexios, iii, fled, from, the, capital, and, alexios, angelos, was, elevated, to, the, throne, as, alexios, iv, along, with, his, blind, father, isaac, alexios, iv, and, isaac, ii, were, unable, to, keep, their, promises, and, were, deposed, by, alexios, v, the, crusaders, again, took, the, city, on, 13, april, 1204, and, constantinople, was, subjected, to, pillage, and, massacre, by, the, rank, and, file, for, three, days, many, priceless, icons, relics, and, other, objects, later, turned, up, in, western, europe, a, large, number, in, venice, according, to, chronicler, niketas, choniates, a, prostitute, was, even, set, up, on, the, patriarchal, throne, when, order, had, been, restored, the, crusaders, and, the, venetians, proceeded, to, implement, their, agreement, baldwin, of, flanders, was, elected, emperor, of, a, new, latin, empire, and, the, venetian, thomas, morosini, was, chosen, as, patriarch, the, lands, divided, up, among, the, leaders, included, most, of, the, former, byzantine, possessions, although, venice, was, more, interested, in, commerce, than, conquering, territory, it, took, key, areas, of, constantinople, and, the, doge, took, the, title, of, lord, of, a, quarter, and, half, a, quarter, of, the, roman, empire, after, the, sack, of, constantinople, in, 1204, by, latin, crusaders, two, byzantine, successor, states, were, established, the, empire, of, nicaea, and, the, despotate, of, epirus, a, third, the, empire, of, trebizond, was, created, after, alexios, komnenos, commanding, the, georgian, expedition, in, chaldia, a, few, weeks, before, the, sack, of, constantinople, found, himself, de, facto, emperor, and, established, himself, in, trebizond, of, the, three, successor, states, epirus, and, nicaea, stood, the, best, chance, of, reclaiming, constantinople, the, nicaean, empire, struggled, to, survive, the, next, few, decades, however, and, by, the, mid, 13th, century, it, had, lost, much, of, southern, anatolia, the, weakening, of, the, sultanate, of, r, m, following, the, mongol, invasion, in, 1242, 1243, allowed, many, beyliks, and, ghazis, to, set, up, their, own, principalities, in, anatolia, weakening, the, byzantine, hold, on, asia, minor, two, centuries, later, one, of, the, beys, of, these, beyliks, osman, i, would, establish, the, ottoman, empire, that, would, eventually, conquer, constantinople, however, the, mongol, invasion, also, gave, nicaea, a, temporary, respite, from, seljuk, attacks, allowing, it, to, concentrate, on, the, latin, empire, to, its, north, the, empire, of, nicaea, founded, by, the, laskarid, dynasty, managed, to, recapture, constantinople, in, 1261, and, defeat, epirus, this, led, to, a, short, lived, revival, of, byzantine, fortunes, under, michael, viii, palaiologos, but, the, war, ravaged, empire, was, ill, equipped, to, deal, with, the, enemies, that, surrounded, it, to, maintain, his, campaigns, against, the, latins, michael, pulled, troops, from, asia, minor, and, levied, crippling, taxes, on, the, peasantry, causing, much, resentment, massive, construction, projects, were, completed, in, constantinople, to, repair, the, damage, of, the, fourth, crusade, but, none, of, these, initiatives, were, of, any, comfort, to, the, farmers, in, asia, minor, suffering, raids, from, muslim, ghazis, rather, than, holding, on, to, his, possessions, in, asia, minor, michael, chose, to, expand, the, empire, gaining, only, short, term, success, to, avoid, another, sacking, of, the, capital, by, the, latins, he, forced, the, church, to, submit, to, rome, again, a, temporary, solution, for, which, the, peasantry, hated, michael, and, constantinople, the, efforts, of, andronikos, ii, and, later, his, grandson, andronikos, iii, marked, byzantium, s, last, genuine, attempts, to, restoring, the, glory, of, the, empire, however, the, use, of, mercenaries, by, andronikos, ii, often, backfired, with, the, catalan, company, ravaging, the, countryside, and, increasing, resentment, towards, constantinople, the, situation, became, worse, for, byzantium, during, the, civil, wars, after, andronikos, iii, died, a, six, year, long, civil, war, devastated, the, empire, allowing, the, serbian, ruler, stefan, du, an, to, overrun, most, of, the, empire, s, remaining, territory, and, establish, a, serbian, empire, in, 1354, an, earthquake, at, gallipoli, devastated,

ottomans, constantinople, by, this, stage, was, underpopulated, and, dilapidated, the, population, of, the, city, had, collapsed, so, severely, that, it, was, now, little, more, than, a, cluster, of, villages, separated, by, fields, on, 2, april, 1453, sultan, mehmed, s, army, of, 80, 000, men, and, large, numbers, of, irregulars, laid, siege, to, the, city, despite, a, desperate, last, ditch,

after, the, walls, of, the, city, were, taken, the, empire, was, centred, in, what, is, now, greece, and, turkey, with, constantinople, as, its, capital, in, the, 5th, century, it, controlled, the, eastern, basis, of, the, mediterranean, running, east, from, singidunum, modern, belgrade, in, a, line, through, the, adriatic, sea, and, south, to, cyrene, libya, this, encompassed, most, of, the, balkans, all, of, modern, greece, turkey, syria, palestine, north, africa, primarily, with, modern, egypt, and, libya, the, aegean, islands, along, with, crete, cyprus, and, sicily, and, a, small,

was, above, the, law, within, the, law, and, the, law, itself, with, a, power, that, is, difficult, to, define, and, which, does, not, align, with, our, modern, understanding, of, the, separation, of,

those, 843, years, was, the, empire, not, ruled, by, men, linked, by, blood, or, kinship, which, was, largely, due, to, the, practice, of, co, emperorship, as, a, result, of, the, diocletianic, constantinian, reforms, the, empire, was, organised, into, praetorian, prefectures, and, the, army, was, separated, from, the, civil, administration, from, the, 7th, century, onwards, the, prefectures, became, provinces, and, were, later, divided, into, districts, called, themata, governed, by, a, military, commander, called, a, strategos, who, oversaw, the, civil, and, military, administration, in, earlier, times, cities, had, been, a, collection, of, self, governing, communities, with, central, government, and, church, representatives, whereas, the, emperor, focused, on,

byzantine, caliphate, diplomacy, with, the, muslim, states, however, differed, and, centred, on, war, related, matters, such, as, hostages, or, the, prevention, of, hostilities, the, primary,

location, and, limited, resources, historian, james, howard, johnston, states, a, change, in, policies, by, emperors, in, the, 9th, and, early, 10th, centuries, was, the, basis, for, future, activity,

weakened, empire, to, act, like, a, great, power, of, the, past, in, the, 13, 14th, centuries, nikolaos, oikonomides, states, that, the, constantinople, patriarch, elevated, the, emperor, s, credibility, during, this, challenging, time, as, the, empire, battled, militant, islam, geographically, and, latin, christians, economically, and, ultimately, it, was, its, efficient, foreign, relations, that, kept, the, state, alive, in, this, late, era, and, not, anything, else, roman, law, has, its, origins, in, the, twelve, tables, and, evolved, mainly, through, the, annual, praetorian, edict, and, the, opinions, of, educated, specialists, called, jurists, hadrian, r, 117, 138, made, the, praetorian, edict, permanent, and, ruled, that, if, all, the, jurists, agreed, on, a, legal, point, it, would, be, considered, law, the, law, eventually, became, confusing, due, to, conflicting, sources, and, it, was, not, clear, what, it, should, be, efforts, were, made, to, reduce, the, confusion, such, as, two, private, collections, collating, the, imperial, constitutions, since, hadrian, s, reign, the, codices, gregorianus, and, the, hermogenianus, which, were, developed, during, the, reign, of, diocletian, r, 284, 305, eventually, an, official, reform, of, roman, law, was, initiated, by, the, east, when, theodosius, ii, r, 402, 450, elevated, five, jurists, to, the, role, of, principal, authorities, and, compiled, the, legislation, issued, since, constantine, s, reign, into, the, codex, theodosianus, this, work, was, completed, by, what, is, collectively, known, today, as, the, corpus, juris, civilis, when, justinian, i, r, 527, 565, commissioned, a, complete, standardisation, of, imperial, decrees, since, hadrian, s, reign, and, also, incorporated, a, comprehensive, collection, of, jurists, opinions, resolving, conflicts, to, create, a, final, authority, this, work, was, not, restricted, in, its, scope, to, just, civil, law, but, also, covered, the, power, of, the, emperor, the, organisation, of, the, empire, and, other, matters, now, classified, as, public, law, after, 534, justinian, would, legislate, the, novellae, new, laws, in, greek, as, well, which, legal, historian, bernard, stolte, proposes, as, a, convenient, breaking, point, to, demarcate, the, end, of, roman, law, and, the, start, of, byzantine, law, this, division, is, proposed, largely, due, to, the, legal, heritage, of, western, europe, coming, mostly, from, law, written, in, latin, as, transmitted, through, the, corpus, juris, civilis, the, researcher, zachary, chitwood, claims, that, the, corpus, juris, civilis, was, inaccessible, in, latin, particularly, in, the, empire, s, provinces, there, was, also, a, stronger, association, of, christianity, with, the, law, after, people, questioned, how, the, law, was, developed, and, used, following, the, 7th, century, islamic, conquests, together, this, created, the, backdrop, for, leo, iii, r, 717, 741, to, develop, the, ecloga, with, a, greater, view, of, humanity, the, three, so, called, leges, speciales, the, farmers, law, the, seamen, s, law, and, the, soldiers, law, were, derived, from, the, ecloga, which, zachary, chitwood, claims, were, likely, used, on, a, daily, basis, in, the, provinces, as, companions, to, the, corpus, juris, civilis, the, macedonian, dynasty, started, their, reform, attempts, with, the, procheiron, and, the, eisagoge, to, replace, the, ecloga, due, to, its, associations, with, iconoclasm, but, also, noteworthy, because, they, show, an, effort, to, define, the, emperor, s, power, according, to, the, prevalent, laws, leo, vi, r, 886, 912, achieved, the, complete, codification, of, roman, law, in, the, greek, language, with, the, basilika, a, monumental, work, consisting, of, 60, books, and, that, became, the, foundation, of, all, subsequent, byzantine, law, the, hexabiblos, published, in, 1345, by, a, jurist, was, a, law, book, in, six, volumes, compiled, from, a, wide, range, of, byzantine, legal, sources, the, roman, and, byzantine, law, codes, form, the, basis, of, the, modern, world, s, civil, law, tradition, underlying, the, legal, system, of, western, and, eastern, europe, latin, america, african, nations, like, ethiopia, the, countries, that, follow, common, law, with, ongoing, debates, about, its, impact, on, islamic, countries, as, an, example, the, hexabiblos, was, the, basis, of, greece, s, civil, code, until, the, mid, 20th, century, historians, used, to, think, that, there, was, no, continuity, between, roman, and, byzantine, law, but, this, view, has, now, changed, due, to, new, scholarship, for, most, of, its, history, the, byzantine, empire, was, not, aware, of, or, did, not, use, heraldry, the, way, western, european, nations, did, various, emblems, greek, s, meia, sing, s, meion, were, used, on, official, occasions, and, for, military, purposes, such, as, banners, or, shields, displaying, various, motifs, such, as, the, cross, or, the, labarum, the, use, of, the, cross, and, images, of, christ, the, virgin, mary, and, various, saints, is, also, attested, on, the, seals, of, officials, but, these, were, personal, rather, than, family, emblems, from, the, rule, of, diocletian, r, 284, 305, until, the, east, s, peak, following, justinian, s, recovery, of, western, territories, in, 540, the, population, could, have, been, as, high, as, 27, million, but, would, fall, to, as, low, as, 12, million, in, 800, plague, and, loss, of, territories, to, the, arab, muslim, invaders, significantly, impacted, the, empire, but, it, recovered, and, by, the, near, end, of, the, macedonian, dynasty, in, 1025, the, population, is, estimated, to, have, been, as, high, as, 18, million, a, few, decades, after, the, recapture, of, constantinople, in, 1282, the, empire, s, population, was, in, the, range, of, 3, 5, million, by, 1312, the, number, had, dropped, to, 2, million, by, the, time, the, ottoman, turks, captured, constantinople, there, were, only, 50, 000, people, in, the, city, which, was, one, tenth, of, its, population, in, its, prime, education, was, voluntary, and, required, financial, means, to, attend, with, the, most, literate, people, being, the, ones, associated, with, the, church, reading, writing, and, arithmetic, were, foundational, subjects, taught, in, primary, education, whereas, secondary, school, focused, on, the, trivium, and, quadrivium, as, their, curriculum, the, imperial, university, of, constantinople, sometimes, known, as, the, university, of, the, palace, hall, of, magnaura, greek, was, an, educational, institution, that, could, trace, its, origins, to, 425, ad, when, emperor, theodosius, ii, had, established, the, pandidakterion, medieval, greek, the, pandidakterion, was, re, established, in, 1046, by, constantine, ix, monomachos, who, created, the, departments, of, law, and, philosophy, the, granting, of, citizenship, in, 212, to, all, free, men, residing, in, its, territories, transformed, the, multi, lingual, roman, empire, expanding, citizenship, to, a, vast, majority, of, its, population, and, leading, to, a, shift, towards, societal, uniformity, particularly, in, its, citizens, religious, practices, diocletian, s, reforms, significantly, altered, governmental, structure, reach, and, taxation, and, these, reforms, also, had, the, effect, of, downgrading, the, first, capital, rome, the, constantinan, dynasty, s, support, for, christianity, as, well, as, the, elevation, of, constantinople, as, an, imperial, seat, further, solidified, this, transformation, in, the, late, 4th, century, when, the, majority, of, the, empire, s, citizens, were, pagan, theodosius, built, on, previous, emperors, bans, and, enacted, many, laws, restricting, pagan, activities, but, it, would, not, be, until, justinian, in, 529, when, conversions, would, be, enforced, the, confiscation, of, pagan, treasures, diversion, of, funds, and, legal, discrimination, led, to, the, decline, of, paganism, resulting, in, events, like, the, closure, of, schools, of, philosophy, and, the, end, of, the, ancient, olympics, christianity, was, also, aided, by, the, prevalence, of, greek, and, christianity, s, debates, further, increased, the, importance, of, greek, making, the, emergent, church, dependent, on, branches, of, hellenic, thought, such, as, neoplatonism, despite, the, transition, the, historian, anthony, kaldellis, views, christianity, as, bringing, no, economic, social, or, political, changes, to, the, state, other, than,

state, policies, which, prohibited, the, enslavement, of, christians, shaped, byzantine, slave, holding, from, the, 8th, century, onwards, however, slavery, persisted, due, to, a, steady, source, of, non, christians, with, prices, remaining, stable, until, 1300, when, prices, for, adult, slaves, particularly, females, started, rising, agriculture, was, the, main, basis, of, taxation, and, the,

in, the, west, and, latin, was, asserted, as, the, language, of, power, in, the, east, despite, this, greek, s, influence, gradually, grew, in, the, government, beginning, when, arcadius, in, 397, ad, allowed, judges, to, issue, decisions, in, greek, theodosius, ii, in, 439, expanded, its, use, in, legal, procedures, the, first, law, in, greek, was, issued, in, 448, and, when, leo, i, legislated, in, the, language, in, the, 460s, justinian, i, s, corpus, juris, civilis, a, compilation, of, mostly, roman, jurists, was, written, almost, entirely, in, latin, however, the, laws, issued, after, 534, from, justinian, s, novellae, constitutiones, onwards, were, in, both, greek, and, latin, which, marks, the, year, when, the, government, also, officially, began, to, use, the, former, language,

century, knowledge, of, latin, was, no, longer, unusual, in, constantinople, many, other, languages, are, attested, in, the, empire, not, just, in, constantinople, but, also, at, its, frontiers, they, include, syriac, coptic, slavonic, armenian, georgian, illyrian, thracian, and, celtic, these, were, typically, the, languages, of, the, lower, strata, of, the, population, and, the, illiterate, who, were, the, vast, majority, the, empire, was, a, multi, lingual, state, but, greek, bound, everyone, and, the, forces, of, assimilation, would, lead, to, the, diversity, of, its, peoples, languages, declining, over, time, following, the, split, of, the, western, and, eastern, roman, empires, the, west, fell, victim, to, political, instability, social, unrest, civil, war, and, invasions, from, foreign, powers, in, contrast, the, byzantines, remained, comparatively, stable, allowing, for, the, growth, of, a, flourishing, and, resilient, economy, institutional, stability, such, as, the, presence, of, a, legal, system, and, the, maintenance, of, infrastructure, created, a, secure, environment, for, economic, growth, in, the, 530s, the, territory, of, the, empire, encompassed, both, a, massive, population, of, around, 30, million, people, and, a, wide, array, of, natural, resources, the, byzantines, had, access, to, resources, such, as, abundant, gold, mines, in, the, balkans, or, the, fertile, fields, of, egypt, large, sections, of, the, byzantine, population, lived, within, the, many, urbanized, settlements, inherited, from, the, previously, unified, roman, empire,

century, with, evidence, of, massive, construction, projects, suggesting, that, the, byzantine, treasury, remained, strong, during, the, 5th, and, 6th, centuries, rural, development, continued, alongside, urban, development, the, number, of, documented, agricultural, settlements, increased, significantly, during, this, period, although, the, reconquests, of, north, africa, and, italy, by, justinian, i, were, expensive, and, draining, campaigns, they, reopened, mediterranean, trade, routes, and, parts, of, the, roman, west, were, reconnected, with, the, east, the, plague, of, justinian,

wealthy, provinces, of, syria, egypt, and, palestine, however, these, short, term, fortunes, were, quickly, reversed, following, the, arab, conquests, beginning, in, the, 630s, the, arab, wars, with, the, romans, halved, byzantine, territory, including, rich, provinces, such, as, egypt, these, collective, disasters, led, to, severe, economic, deterioration, culminating, in, large, scale, deurbanization, and, impoverishment, throughout, the, empire, demographic, and, urban, decline, sparked, the, destruction, of, trade, routes, with, trade, reaching, its, lowest, point, by, the, 8th,

contrast, to, the, basilica, plans, favored, in, medieval, western, european, churches, byzantine, churches, usually, had, more, centralized, ground, plans, such, as, the, cross, in, square, plan,

of, the, classical, realist, tradition, that, was, missing, in, larger, works, till, the, end, of, the, empire, byzantine, art, was, highly, prestigious, and, sought, after, in, western, europe, where, it, maintained, a, continuous, influence, on, medieval, art, till, the, near, end, of, the, period, this, was, especially, true, in, italy, where, byzantine, styles, persisted, in, modified, forms, through, the, 12th, century, and, became, formative, influences, on, italian, renaissance, art, however, few, incoming, influences, affected, the, byzantine, style, with, the, expansion, of, the, eastern, orthodox, church, byzantine, forms, and, styles, spread, throughout, the, orthodox, world, and, beyond, byzantine, literature, concerns, all, greek, literature, from, the, middle, ages, although, the, empire, was, linguistically, diverse, the, vast, majority, of, extant, texts, are, in, medieval, greek, albeit, in, two, diglossic, variants, a, scholarly, form, based, on, attic, greek, and, a, vernacular, based, on, koine, greek, most, contemporary, scholars, consider, all, medieval, greek, texts, to, be, literature, but, some, offer, varying, constraints, the, literature, s, early, period, c, 330, 650, was, dominated, by, the, competing, cultures, of, hellenism, christianity, and, paganism, the, greek, church, fathers, educated, in, an, ancient, greek, rhetoric, tradition, sought, to, synthesize, these, influences, important, early, writers, include, john, chrysostom, pseudo, dionysius, the, areopagite, and, procopius, all, of, whom, aimed, to, reinvent, older, forms, to, fit, the, empire, theological, miracle, stories, were, particularly, innovative, and, popular, the, sayings, of, the, desert, fathers, apophthegmata, patrum, were, copied, in, practically, every, byzantine, monastery, during, the, byzantine, dark, ages, c, 650, 800, production, of, literature, mostly, stopped, although, some, important, theologians, were, active, such, as, maximus, the, confessor, germanus, i, of, constantinople, and, john, of, damascus, the, subsequent, encyclopedism, period, c, 800, 1000, saw, a, renewed, proliferation, of, literature, and, revived, the, earlier, hellenic, christian, synthesis, works, by, homer, ancient, greek, philosophers, and, tragedians, were, translated, while, hagiography, was, heavily, reorganized, after, this, early, flowering, of, monastic, literature, there, was, a, dearth, until, symeon, the, new, theologian, in, the, late, 10th, century, a, new, generation, c, 1000, 1250, including, symeon, michael, psellos,

music, composed, to, greek, texts, as, ceremonial, festival, or, church, music, are, today, the, most, well, known, forms, ecclesiastical, chants, were, a, fundamental, part, of, this, genre, greek, and, foreign, historians, agree, that, the, ecclesiastical, tones, and, in, general, the, whole, system, of, byzantine, music, is, closely, related, to, the, ancient, greek, system, it, remains, the, oldest, genre, of, extant, music, of, which, the, manner, of, performance, and, with, increasing, accuracy, from, the, 5th, century, onwards, the, names, of, the, composers, and, sometimes, the, particulars, of, each, musical, work, s, circumstances, are, known, the, 9th, century, persian, geographer, ibn, khordadbeh, in, his, lexicographical, discussion, of, instruments, cited, the, lyra, l, r, as, the, typical, instrument, of, the, byzantines, along, with, the, urghun, organ, shilyani, probably, a, type, of, harp, or, lyre, and, the, salandj, probably, a, bagpipe, the, first, of, these, the, early, bowed, stringed, instrument, known, as, the, byzantine, lyra, came, to, be, called, the, lira, da, braccio, in, venice, where, it, is, considered, by, many, to, have, been, the, predecessor, of, the, contemporary, violin, which, later, flourished, there, the, bowed, lyra, is, still, played, in, former, byzantine, regions, where, it, is, known, as, the, politiki, lyra, lit, lyra, of, the, city, i, e, constantinople, in, greece, the, calabrian, lira, in, southern, italy, and, the, lijerica, in, dalmatia, the, water, organ, originated, in, the, hellenistic, world, and, was, used, in, the, hippodrome, during, races, a, pipe, organ, with, great, leaden, pipes, was, sent, by, emperor, constantine, v, to, pepin, the, short, king, of, the, franks, in, 757, pepin, s, son, charlemagne, requested, a, similar, organ, for, his, chapel, in, aachen, in, 812, beginning, its, establishment, in, western, church, music, the, aulos, was, a, double, reeded, woodwind, like, the, modern, oboe, or, armenian, duduk, other, forms, include, the, plagiaulos, from, sideways, which, resembled, the, flute, and, the, askaulos, askos, wineskin, a, bagpipe, the, modern, descendant, of, the, aulos, is, the, greek, zourna, bagpipes, also, known, as, dankiyo, from, ancient, greek, angion, the, container, had, been, played, even, in, roman, times, and, continue, to, be, played, throughout, the, empire, s, former, realms, till, the, present, day, these, are, namely, the, balkan, gaida, greek, tsampouna, pontic, tulum, cretan, askomandoura, armenian, parkapzuk, and, romanian, cimpoi, other, instruments, used, in, byzantine, music, were, the, kanonaki, tambouras, semantron, salpinx, boukina, syrinx, crotala, tympana, and, cheirokymbala, during, the, 12th, century, there, was, a, revival, in, mosaic, and, regional, schools, of, architecture, began, producing, many, distinctive, styles, that, drew, on, a, range, of, cultural, influences, in, this, period, the, byzantines, provided, the, earliest, model, of, renaissance, humanism, through, their, revival, of, interest, in, classical, authors, eustathius, of, thessalonica, is, considered, the, greatest, example, of, byzantine, humanism, as, he, studied, both, classics, and, theology, in, philosophy, there, was, a, resurgence, of, classical, learning, not, seen, since, the, 7th, century, characterised, by, a, significant, increase, in, the, publication, of, commentaries, on, classical, works, moreover, the, first, transmission, of, classical, greek, knowledge, to, the, west, occurred, during, the, komnenian, period, in, terms, of, prosperity, and, cultural, life, the, komnenian, period, was, one, of, the, peaks, in, byzantine, history, and, constantinople, remained, the, leading, city, of, the, christian, world, in, size, wealth, and, culture, there, was, a, renewed, interest, in, classical, greek, philosophy, as, well, as, an, increase, in, literary, output, in, vernacular, greek, byzantine, art, and, literature, held, a, pre, eminent, place, in, europe, and, the, cultural, impact, of, byzantine, art, on, the, west, during, this, period, was, enormous, and, of, long, lasting, significance, byzantine, science, played, an, important, and, crucial, role, in, the, transmission, of, classical, knowledge, to, the, islamic, world, and, to, renaissance, italy, many, of, the, most, distinguished, classical, scholars, held, high, offices, in, the, eastern, orthodox, church, the, writings, of, classical, antiquity, were, cultivated, and, preserved, in, byzantium, therefore, byzantine, science, was, in, every, period, closely, connected, with, ancient, philosophy, and, metaphysics, in, the, field, of, engineering, isidore, of, miletus, the, greek, mathematician, and, architect, of, the, hagia, sophia, produced, the, first, compilation, of, archimedes, works, c, 530, and, it, is, through, this, manuscript, tradition, kept, alive, by, the, school, of, mathematics, and, engineering, founded, c, 850, during, the, byzantine, renaissance, by, leo, the, mathematician, that, such, works, are, known, today, primarily, through, the, school, s, production, the, archimedes, palimpsest, alexandrian, philosopher, john, philoponus, was, the, first, to, question, aristotelian, physics, unlike, aristotle, who, based, his, physics, on, verbal, arguments, philoponus, relied, on, observations, philoponus, criticism, of, the, aristotelian, principles, of, physics, was, an, inspiration, for, galileo, galilei, s, refutation, of, aristotelian, physics, during, the, scientific, revolution, many, centuries, later, as, galileo, cites, philoponus, substantially, in, his, works, the, byzantines, pioneered, the, concept, of, the, hospital, as, an, institution, offering, medical, care, and, the, possibility, of, a, cure, for, the, patients, as, a, reflection, of, the, ideals, of, christian, charity, rather, than, merely, being, a, place, to, die, greek, fire, an, incendiary, weapon, which, could, even, burn, on, water, is, attributed, to, the, byzantines, it, played, a, crucial, role, in, the, empire, s, victory, over, the, umayyad, caliphate, during, the, siege, of, constantinople, 717, 718, the, discovery, is, attributed, to, callinicus, of, heliopolis, from, syria, who, fled, during, the, arab, conquest, of, syria, however, it, has, also, been, argued, that, no, single, person, invented, greek, fire, but, rather, that, it, was, invented, by, the, chemists, in, constantinople, who, had, inherited, the, discoveries, of, the, alexandrian, chemical, school, in, the, final, century, of, the, empire, astronomy, and, other, mathematical, sciences, were, taught, in, trebizond, medicine, attracted, the, interest, of, almost, all, scholars, the, fall, of, constantinople, in, 1453, fuelled, the, era, later, commonly, known, as, the, italian, renaissance, during, this, period, refugee, byzantine, scholars, were, principally, responsible, for, carrying, in, person, and, writing, ancient, greek, grammatical, literary, mathematical, and, astronomical, knowledge, to, early, renaissance, italy, they, also, brought, with, them, classical, learning, and, texts, on, botany, medicine, and, zoology, as, well, as, the, works, of, dioscorides, and, john, philoponus, criticism, of, aristotelian, physics, the, first, christian, communities, began, in, judea, in, the, roman, empire, in, the, second, quarter, of, the, first, century, they, swiftly, spread, into, the, jewish, diaspora, along, the, trade, and, travel, routes, followed, by, merchants, soldiers, and, migrating, tribes, moving, from, fewer, than, 50, 000, adherents, to, over, a, million, in, the, hundred, years, between, 150, and, 250, driven, by, a, universalist, logic, christianity, has, been, from, its, beginnings, a, missionary, faith, with, global, aspirations, leading, it, to, become, a, part, of, the, history, of, a, great, many, civilizations, constantine, the, great, became, the, roman, emperor, in, 306, and, issued, the, edict, of, milan, expressing, tolerance, for, all, religions, in, 313, the, edict, was, a, pluralist, policy, and, throughout, the, roman, empire, of, the, fourth, to, sixth, centuries, people, chose, between, a, variety, of, religious, groups, in, a, kind, of, religious, marketplace, constantine, did, not, make, christianity, the, state, religion, law, literature, rituals, and, institutions, indicate, that, converting, the, empire, to, christianity, was, a, complex, long, term, slow, paced, and, uneven, process, with, no, single, moment, or, event, to, mark, christianity, becoming, the, roman, empire, s, state, religion, constantine, wrote, laws, against, sacrifice, and, magic, and, laws, that, favored, christianity, but, there, was, no, legislation, forcing, the, conversion, of, polytheists, until, the, reign, of, the, eastern, emperor, justinian, i, in, a, d, 529, in, the, fourth, century, the, diverse, network, of, separate, churches, became, an, organization, that, mirrored, the, structure, of, the, roman, empire, often, referred, to, as, the, golden, age, of, patristic, christianity, christians, of, this, era, compiled, many, of, christianity, s, greatest, works, as, they, transformed, and, defined, its, art, culture, literature, philosophy, and, politics, its, internal, and, external, relationships, and, its, theology, the, church, of, this, age, was, seen, by, its, supporters, as, a, universal, all, embracing, union, of, separate, individual, churches, yet, the, tendency, for, east, and, west, to, grow, apart, was, already, evident, the, western, church, spoke, latin, while, the, east, spoke, and, wrote, in, greek, and, at, least, five, other, languages, the, ancient, state, was, a, religious, institution, yet, east, and, west, related, to, that, state, differently, the, catholic, church, condemned, roman, culture, as, sinful, kept, itself, as, separate, as, possible, and, struggled, to, resist, state, control, this, is, in, pointed, contrast, with, eastern, christianity, which, acclaimed, harmony, with, greek, culture, and, whose, emperors, and, patriarchs, upheld, unanimity, between, church, and, state, regional, variations, led, to, competing, orthodoxies, and, conflicts, over, defining, heresy, and, orthodoxy, dominated, fourth, century, christianity, these, ongoing, controversies, were, a, large, part, of, what, led, the, armenian, assyrian, and, egyptian, churches, to, combine, into, what, is, today, known, as, oriental, orthodoxy, one, of, three, major, branches, of, eastern, christianity, along, with, the, church, of, the, east, in, persia, and, eastern, orthodoxy, in, byzantium, the, patriarchs, in, the, east, frequently, looked, to, the, pope, the, bishop, of, rome, to, resolve, disagreements, for, them, thereby, establishing, what, would, later, become, important, features, of, papal, power, and, influence, still, by, the, end, of, the, sixth, century, large, sections, of, both, the, western, and, eastern, church, remained, unconvinced, they, should, be, submissive, to, the, roman, see, the, vision, of, a, universal, and, united, christendom, was, slowly, coming, undone, according, to, the, early, christian, expert, tia, kolbaba, the, arab, lombard, and, slavic, invasions, contributed, to, the, alienation, between, the, churches, of, rome, and, constantinople, despite, their, shared, past, disagreement, about, constantinople, s, jurisdiction, compared, to, rome, s, intensified, as, a, result, misunderstandings, and, conflicts, over, ritual, such, as, the, use, of, unleavened, bread, in, the, eucharist, and, differences, in, points, of, doctrine, such, as, the, filioque, clause, and, nestorianism, as, well, as, differences, in, religious, practices, such, as, celibacy, and, even, the, growing, of, beards, underline, the, increasing, separation, of, their, unique, social, structures, and, cultures, theological, differences, became, more, pronounced, there, was, a, general, lack, of, charity, and, respect, on, both, sides, in, 1054, the, patriarch, of, constantinople, refused, to, submit, to, the, supremacy, of, the, roman, pope, eventually, this, all, led, to, the, east, west, schism, also, known, as, the, great, schism, which, officially, separated, christianity, into, western, catholicism, and, eastern, orthodoxy, in, 1439, a, reunion, agreement, between, the, eastern, and, western, church, was, proposed, popular, resistance, in, the, east, interfered, so, it, wasn, t, until, 1452, that, the, decree, of, union, was, officially, published, in, constantinople, the, agreement, was, overthrown, the, very, next, year, by, the, fall, of, constantinople, to, the, ottoman, turks, in, 1453, the, conquest, of, 1453, destroyed, the, orthodox, church, as, an, institution, of, the, christian, empire, inaugurated, by, constantine, sealing, off, greek, speaking, orthodoxy, from, the, west, for, almost, a, century, and, a, half, however, the, church, survived, in, altered, form, and, the, spiritual, and, cultural, influence, of, the, eastern, church, constantinople, and, mount, athos, the, monastic, peninsula, has, continued, byzantine, jewry, played, a, prominent, role, in, the, medieval, jewish, world, the, karaite, schism, and, the, venetian, and, genoese, conquests, during, the, fourth, crusade, introduced, divisions, but, these, did, not, significantly, impact, the, commercial, or, cultural, life, of, the, jewish, or, christian, communities, by, the, time, of, the, fall, of, constantinople, the, byzantine, empire, already, an, empire, in, name, only, since, the, fourth, crusade, had, been, reduced, to, three, rump, states, the, despotate, of, the, morea, the, empire, of, trebizond, and, the, principality, of, theodoro, the, morea, was, ruled, by, the, brothers, of, constantine, xi, thomas, palaiologos, and, demetrios, palaiologos, the, despotate, continued, as, an, independent, state, by, paying, an, annual, tribute, to, the, ottomans, incompetent, rule, failure, to, pay, the, annual, tribute, and, a, revolt, against, the, ottomans, finally, led, to, mehmed, ii, s, invasion, of, morea, in, may, 1460, a, few, holdouts, remained, for, a, time, in, the, morea, the, island, of,
