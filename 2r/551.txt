of, the, effete, osmanlis, was, the, last, thing, desired, by, the, power, which, wished, naturally, enough, to, command, the, gate, into, the, mediterranean, russia, was, satisfied, with, the, weak, government, in, constantinople, istanbul, as, a, result, the, treaty, of, h, nk, r, skelesi, was, signed, and, greatly, benefited, russia, it, provided, for, a, military, alliance, between, the, russian, and, the, ottoman, empires, if, one, of, them, was, attacked, and, a, secret, additional, clause, allowed, the, ottomans, to, opt, out, of, sending, troops, but, to, close, the, straits, to, foreign, warships, if, russia, were, under, threat, egypt, remained, nominally, under, ottoman, sovereignty, but, was, de, facto, independent, in, 1838, in, a, situation, similar, to, that, of, 1831, muhammad, ali, of, egypt, was, not, happy, about, his, lack, of, control, and, power, in, syria, and, he, resumed, military, action, the, ottomans, lost, to, the, egyptians, at, the, battle, of, nezib, on, 24, june, 1839, but, were, saved, by, britain, austria, prussia, and, russia, who, signed, a, convention, in, london, on, 15, july, 1840, that, granted, muhammad, ali, and, his, descendants, the, right, to, inherit, power, in, egypt, in, exchange, for, the, removal, of, egyptian, forces, from, syria, and, lebanon, moreover, muhammad, ali, had, to, admit, a, formal, dependence, on, the, ottoman, sultan, after, muhammad, ali, refused, to, obey, the, requirements, of, the, convention, the, allied, anglo, austrian, fleet, blockaded, the, nile, delta, bombarded, beirut, and, captured, acre, muhammad, ali, then, accepted, the, convention, s, conditions, on, 13, july, 1841, after, the, expiry, of, the, treaty, of, h, nk, r, skelesi, the, london, straits, convention, was, signed, under, pressure, from, the, european, countries, the, new, treaty, deprived, russia, of, its, right, to, block, warships, from, passing, into, the, black, sea, in, case, of, war, thus, the, way, to, the, black, sea, was, open, for, british, and, french, warships, during, a, possible, russo, ottoman, conflict, russian, historians, tend, to, view, that, history, as, evidence, that, russia, lacked, aggressive, plans, the, russian, historian, v, n, vinogradov, writes, the, signing, of, the, documents, was, the, result, of, deliberate, decisions, instead, of, bilateral, none, of, the, great, powers, recognized, this, treaty, of, unkiar, skelessi, the, new, treaty, of, london, was, obligatory, for, all, it, closed, the, bosphorus, and, dardanelles, in, the, absence, of, expansion, plans, this, was, a, sound, decision, in, 1838, britain, lost, interest, in, crushing, the, ottoman, empire, on, the, contrary, after, the, conclusion, of, the, trade, treaty, of, 1838, see, treaty, of, balta, liman, britain, received, unlimited, access, to, the, markets, of, the, ottoman, empire, britain, imposed, on, the, porte, a, tariff, convention, which, in, effect, transformed, the, ottoman, empire, into, a, virtual, free, trade, zone, therefore, its, trade, interests, pushed, it, to, protect, the, integrity, of, the, ottoman, empire, in, the, long, term, the, ottoman, empire, lost, the, opportunity, to, modernize, and, industrialize, but, in, the, short, term, it, gained, the, opportunity, to, receive, the, support, of, european, powers, primarily, britain, in, opposing, the, desire, of, the, conquered, peoples, for, self, determination, and, russia, which, sought, to, crush, its, influence, in, the, balkans, and, asia, publicly, european, politicians, made, broad, promises, to, the, ottomans, lord, palmerston, the, british, foreign, secretary, said, in, 1839, all, that, we, hear, about, the, decay, of, the, turkish, empire, and, its, being, a, dead, body, or, a, sapless, trunk, and, so, forth, is, pure, and, unadulterated, nonsense, given, 10, years, of, peace, under, european, protection, coupled, with, internal, reform, there, seemed, to, him, no, reason, why, it, should, not, become, again, a, respectable, power, orlando, figes, has, claimed, that, the, motives, of, the, british, in, promoting, liberal, reforms, were, not, just, to, secure, the, independence, of, the, ottoman, empire, against, russia, they, were, also, to, promote, the, influence, of, britain, in, turkey, also, to, promote, british, free, trade, interests, which, may, have, sounded, splendid, but, was, arguably, damaging, to, the, ottoman, empire, british, exports, to, the, ottoman, empire, including, egypt, and, the, danubian, principalities, increased, nearly, threefold, from, 1840, to, 1851, thus, it, was, very, important, from, the, financial, point, of, view, for, britain, to, prevent, the, ottoman, empire, from, falling, into, other, hands, from, this, moment, 1838, the, export, of, british, manufactured, goods, to, turkey, rose, steeply, there, was, an, elevenfold, increase, by, 1850, assistance, from, western, european, powers, or, russia, had, twice, saved, the, ottoman, empire, from, destruction, but, the, ottomans, also, lost, their, independence, in, foreign, policy, britain, and, france, desired, more, than, any, other, states, to, preserve, the, integrity, of, the, ottoman, empire, because, they, did, not, want, to, see, russia, gaining, access, to, the, mediterranean, sea, austria, had, the, same, fears, russia, as, a, member, of, the, holy, alliance, had, operated, as, the, police, of, europe, to, maintain, the, balance, of, power, that, had, been, established, in, the, congress, of, vienna, in, 1815, russia, had, assisted, austria, s, efforts, in, suppressing, the, hungarian, revolution, of, 1848, and, expected, a, free, hand, in, settling, its, problems, with, the, ottoman, empire, the, sick, man, of, europe, however, britain, could, not, tolerate, russian, dominance, of, ottoman, affairs, which, would, challenge, its, domination, of, the, eastern, mediterranean, starting, with, peter, the, great, in, the, early, 1700s, after, centuries, of, ottoman, northward, expansion, and, crimean, nogai, raids, russia, began, a, southwards, expansion, across, the, sparsely, populated, wild, fields, toward, the, warm, water, ports, of, the, black, sea, which, does, not, freeze, over, unlike, the, handful, of, ports, controlled, by, russia, in, the, north, the, goal, was, to, promote, year, round, trade, and, a, year, round, navy, pursuit, of, that, goal, brought, the, emerging, russian, state, into, conflict, with, the, ukrainian, cossacks, and, then, the, tatars, of, the, crimean, khanate, and, circassians, the, plan, to, develop, russia, as, a, southern, power, had, begun, in, earnest, in, 1776, when, catherine, placed, potemkin, in, charge, of, new, russia, novorossiia, the, sparsely, populated, territories, newly, conquered, from, the, ottomans, on, the, black, sea, s, northern, coastline, and, ordered, him, to, colonize, the, area, when, russia, conquered, those, groups, and, gained, possession, of, their, territories, the, ottoman, empire, lost, its, buffer, zone, against, russian, expansion, and, both, empires, came, into, direct, conflict, the, conflict, with, the, ottoman, empire, also, presented, a, religious, issue, of, importance, as, russia, saw, itself, as, the, protector, of, history, of, the, eastern, orthodox, church, under, the, ottoman, orthodox, christians, who, were, legally, treated, as, second, class, citizens, the, ottoman, reform, edict, of, 1856, promulgated, after, the, war, largely, reversed, much, of, the, second, class, status, most, notably, the, tax, that, only, non, muslims, paid, britain, s, immediate, fear, was, russia, s, expansion, at, the, expense, of, the, ottoman, empire, the, british, desired, to, preserve, ottoman, integrity, and, were, concerned, that, russia, might, make, advances, toward, british, india, or, move, toward, scandinavia, or, western, europe, a, distraction, in, the, form, of, the, ottoman, empire, on, the, russian, southwest, flank, would, mitigate, that, threat, the, royal, navy, also, wanted, to, forestall, the, threat, of, a, powerful, imperial, russian, navy, taylor, stated, the, british, perspective, the, crimean, war, was, fought, for, the, sake, of, europe, rather, than, for, the, eastern, question, it, was, fought, against, russia, not, in, favour, of, turkey, the, british, fought, russia, out, of, resentment, and, supposed, that, her, defeat, would, strengthen, the, european, balance, of, power, because, of, british, commercial, and, strategic, interests, in, the, middle, east, and, india, the, british, joined, the, french, cement, an, alliance, with, britain, and, reassert, its, military, power, among, those, who, supported, the, british, strategy, were, karl, marx, and, friedrich, engels, in, his, articles, for, the, new, york, tribune, around, 1853, marx, saw, the, crimean, war, as, a, conflict, between, the, democratic, ideals, of, the, west, that, started, with, the, great, movement, of, 1789, against, russia, and, absolutism, he, described, the, ottoman, empire, as, a, buffer, against, a, pattern, of, expansionism, by, the, tsar, marx, and, engels, also, accused, lord, palmerston, of, playing, along, with, the, interests, of, russia, and, being, unserious, in, preparing, for, the, conflict, marx, believed, palmerston, to, be, bribed, by, russia, and, shared, this, belief, with, david, urquhart, urquhart, for, his, part, was, a, british, politician, who, was, a, major, advocate, for, the, ottoman, empire, mikhail, pogodin, a, professor, of, history, at, moscow, university, gave, nicholas, i, a, summary, of, russia, s, policy, towards, the, slavs, in, the, war, nicholas, answer, was, filled, with, grievances, against, the, west, nicholas, shared, pogodin, s, sense, that, russia, s, role, as, the, protector, of, orthodox, christians, in, the, ottoman, empire, was, not, understood, and, that, russia, was, unfairly, treated, by, the, west, nicholas, especially, approved, of, the, following, passage, france, takes, algeria, from, turkey, and, almost, every, year, england, annexes, another, indian, principality, none, of, this, disturbs, the, balance, of, power, but, when, russia, occupies, moldavia, and, wallachia, albeit, only, temporarily, that, disturbs, the, balance, of, power, france, occupies, rome, and, stays, there, several, years, during, peacetime, that, is, nothing, but, russia, only, thinks, of, occupying, constantinople, and, the, peace, of, europe, is, threatened, the, english, declare, war, on, the, chinese, who, have, it, seems, offended, them, no, one, has, the, right, to, intervene, but, russia, is, obliged, to, ask, europe, for, permission, if, it, quarrels, with, its, neighbour, england, threatens, greece, to, support, the, false, claims, of, a, miserable, jew, and, burns, its, fleet, that, is, a, lawful, action, but, russia, demands, a, treaty, to, protect, millions, of, christians, and, that, is, deemed, to, strengthen, its, position, in, the, east, at, the, expense, of, the, balance, of, power, we, can, expect, nothing, from, the, west, but, blind, hatred, and, malice, comment, in, the, margin, by, nicholas, i, this, is, the, whole, point, russia, was, militarily, weak, technologically, backward, and, administratively, incompetent, despite, its, grand, ambitions, toward, the, south, it, had, not, built, its, railway, network, in, that, direction, and, its, communications, were, poor, its, bureaucracy, was, riddled, with, graft, corruption, and, inefficiency, and, was, unprepared, for, war, its, navy, was, weak, and, technologically, backward, its, army, although, very, large, suffered, from, colonels, who, pocketed, their, men, s, pay, from, poor, morale, and, from, a, technological, deficit, relative, to, britain, and, france, by, the, war, s, end, the, profound, weaknesses, of, the, russian, armed, forces, had, become, readily, apparent, and, the, russian, leadership, was, determined, to, reform, it, however, no, matter, how, great, the, problems, of, russia, were, russia, believed, those, of, the, ottomans, were, greater, in, a, one, to, one, fight, nikolai, tsar, had, no, doubt, of, beating, the, ottoman, armies, and, navy, russian, foreign, policy, failed, to, understand, the,

the, united, kingdom, the, tsar, nicholas, had, always, as, we, have, seen, been, anxious, to, maintain, a, cordial, understanding, with, england, in, regard, to, the, eastern, question, and, early, in, the, spring, of, 1853, he, had, a, series, of, interviews, with, sir, george, hamilton, seymour, then, british, ambassador, at, st, petersburg, emperor, nicholas, i, assured, that, he, did, not, intend, to, seize, constantinople, and, territories, in, the, balkans, he, himself, offered, britain, to, take, over, egypt, and, crete, concessions, at, the, conclusion, of, the, london, straits, convention, were, made, earlier, in, 1841, by, signing, the, convention, the, russians, had, given, up, their, privileged, position, in, the, ottoman, empire, and, their, control, of, the, straits, all, in, the, hope, of, improving, relations, with, britain, and, isolating, france, but, britain, after, 1838, was, interested, in, preserving, the, integrity, of, the, ottoman, empire, and, rejected, all, russian, proposals, the, fall, of, the, ottoman, empire, was, not, however, a, requirement, of, british, policy, in, the, east, a, weak, ottoman, state, best, suited, british,

with, the, ottomans, nesselrode, confided, to, seymour, had, assumed, a, new, character, that, the, acts, of, injustice, towards, the, greek, church, which, it, had, been, desired, to, prevent, had, been, perpetrated, and, consequently, that, now, the, object, must, be, to, find, a, remedy, for, these, wrongs, the, success, of, french, negotiations, at, constantinople, was, to, be, ascribed,

and, nesselrode, began, a, diplomatic, offensive, which, they, hoped, would, prevent, either, british, or, french, interference, in, any, conflict, between, russia, and, the, ottomans, and, prevent, both, from, forming, an, anti, russian, alliance, nicholas, began, courting, britain, by, means, of, conversations, with, seymour, in, january, and, february, 1853, nicholas, insisted, that, he, no, longer, wished, to, expand, the, russian, empire, but, that, he, had, an, obligation, to, the, christian, communities, in, the, ottoman, empire, he, next, dispatched, a, highly, abrasive, diplomat, prince, menshikov, on, a, special, mission, to, the, ottoman, sublime, porte, in, february, 1853, by, previous, treaties, the, sultan, had, committed, to, protect, the, eastern, orthodox, christian, religion, and, its, churches, menshikov, demanded, a, russian, protectorate, over, all, 12, million, orthodox, christians, in, the, ottoman, empire, with, control, of, the, orthodox, church, s, hierarchy, a, compromise, was, reached, regarding, orthodox, access, to, the, holy, land, but, the, sultan, strongly, supported, by, the, british, ambassador, stratford, canning, 1st, viscount, stratford, de, redcliffe, rejected, the, most, sweeping, demands, russian, historian, vinogradov, v, n, point, out, that, menshikov, s, demands, did, not, go, beyond, the, limits, of, previous, treaties, the, agreement, was, reached, on, the, administration, of, church, rites, of, both, clergy, in, respected, temples, and, secondly, that, the, tsar, rejected, the, idea, of, expanding, his, right, of, patronage, and, in, fact, insisted, on, confirming, the, terms, of, the, kucuk, kaynardzhiy, treaty, of, 1774, which, allowed, giving, advice, to, the, sultan, but, did, not, oblige, them, to, accept, by, the, early, 1850s, stratford, canning, had, become, far, more, than, an, ambassador, or, adviser, to, the, porte, the, great, elchi, or, great, ambassador, as, he, was, known, in, constantinople, had, a, direct, influence, on, the, policies, of, the, turkish, government, his, presence, was, a, source, of, deep, resentment, among, the, sultan, s, ministers, who, lived, in, terror, of, a, personal, visit, from, the, dictatorial, ambassador, nicholas, fumed, at, the, infernal, dictatorship, of, this, redcliffe, whose, name, and, political, ascendancy, at, the, porte, personified, for, him, the, whole, eastern, question, the, british, and, the, french, sent, in, naval, task, forces, to, support, the, ottomans, as, russia, had, prepared, to, seize, the, danubian,

help, of, french, infantry, it, was, possible, to, overturn, russia, s, positions, with, one, blow, in, february, 1853, the, british, government, of, prime, minister, lord, aberdeen, reappointed, lord, stratford, as, british, ambassador, to, the, ottoman, empire, having, resigned, the, ambassadorship, in, january, he, had, been, replaced, by, colonel, rose, as, charg, d, affaires, lord, stratford, then, turned, around, sailed, back, to, constantinople, arriving, there, on, 5, april, 1853, and, convinced, the, sultan, there, to, reject, the, russian, treaty, proposal, as, compromising, ottoman, independence, the, leader, of, the, opposition, in, the, british, house, of, commons, benjamin, disraeli, blamed, aberdeen, and, stratford, s, actions, for, making, war, inevitable, which, started, the, process, that, would, force, the, aberdeen, government, to, resign, in, january, 1855, over, the, war, shortly, after, the, tsar, had, learned, of, the, failure, of, menshikov, s, diplomacy, toward, the, end, of, june, 1853, he, sent, armies, under, the, commands, of, field, marshal, ivan, paskevich, and, general, mikhail, gorchakov, across, the, river, prut, into, the, ottoman, controlled, danubian, principalities, of, moldavia, and, wallachia, fewer, than, half, of, the, 80, 000, russian, soldiers, who, crossed, the, prut, in, 1853, survived, by, far, nearly, all, of, the, deaths, would, result, from, sickness, rather, than, action, since, the, russian, army, still, suffered, from, medical, services, that, ranged, from, bad, to, none, russia, had, obtained, recognition, from, the, ottoman, empire, of, the, tsar, s, role, as, special, guardian, of, the, orthodox, christians, in, moldavia, and, wallachia, russia, now, used, the, sultan, s, failure, to, resolve, the, issue, of, the, protection, of, the, christian, sites, in, the, holy, land, as, a, pretext, for, russian, occupation, of, those, danubian, provinces, nicholas, believed, that, the, european, powers, especially, austria, would, not, object, strongly, to, the, annexation, of, a, few, neighbouring, ottoman, provinces, especially, since, russia, had, assisted, austria, s, efforts, in, suppressing, the, hungarian, revolution, in, 1849, the, united, kingdom, hoping, to, maintain, the, ottoman, empire, as, a, bulwark, against, the, expansion, of, russian, power, in, asia, sent, a, fleet, to, the, dardanelles, where, it, joined, a, fleet, sent, by, france, the, european, powers, continued, to, pursue, diplomatic, avenues, the, representatives, of, the, four, great, powers, the, united, kingdom, france, austria, and, prussia, met, in, vienna, where, they, drafted, a, note, which, they, hoped, would, be, acceptable, to, both, the, russians, and, the, ottomans, the, peace, terms, arrived, at, by, the, four, powers, at, the, vienna, conference, 1853, were, delivered, to, the, russians, by, austrian, foreign, minister, count, karl, von, buol, on, 5, december, 1853, the, note, met, with, the, approval, of, nicholas, i, but, abd, lmecid, i, rejected, the, proposal, since, he, felt, that, the, document, s, poor, phrasing, left, it, open, to, many, different, interpretations, the, united, kingdom, france, and, austria, united, in, proposing, amendments, to, mollify, the, sultan, but, the, court, of, st, petersburg, ignored, their, suggestions, the, united, kingdom, and, france, then, set, aside, the, idea, of, continuing, negotiations, but, austria, and, prussia, did, not, believe, that, the, rejection, of, the, proposed, amendments, justified, the, abandonment, of, the, diplomatic, process, on, 23, november, a, small, russian, naval, force, discovered, the, ottoman, fleet, harboured, in, sinop, and, began, a, blockade, once, the, russian, blockade, was, reinforced, a, squadron, of, 6, russian, ships, of, the, line, supported, by, 5, smaller, warships, assaulted, the, harbour, on, 30, november, 1853, during, battle, of, sinop, the, russian, squadron, destroyed, a, patrol, squadron, of, 11, ottoman, warships, mostly, frigates, while, they, were, anchored, in, port, under, defence, of, the, onshore, artillery, garrison, the, ottoman, fleet, suffered, a, crushing, defeat, the, russian, victory, in, the, naval, battle, in, sinope, was, called, the, massacre, of, sinope, although, russia, and, the, ottoman, empire, were, already, at, war, and, there, was, no, evidence, of, russian, atrocities, the, phrase, was, used, as, propaganda, in, the, west, the, press, in, both, united, kingdom, and, france, used, sinop, as, the, casus, belli, cause, of, war, to, shape, the, public, opinion, in, favour, of, war, against, russia, by, 28, march, 1854, after, russia, ignored, an, anglo, french, ultimatum, to, withdraw, from, the, danubian, principalities, the, united, kingdom, and, france, had, both, declared, war, britain, was, concerned, about, russian, activity, and, sir, john, burgoyne, a, senior, advisor, to, lord, aberdeen, urged, for, the, dardanelles, to, be, occupied, and, works, of, sufficient, strength, to, be, built, to, block, any, russian, move, to, capture, constantinople, and, gain, access, to, the, mediterranean, the, corps, of, royal, engineers, sent, men, to, the, dardanelles, and, burgoyne, went, to, paris, and, met, with, the, british, ambassador, and, the, french, emperor, lord, cowley, wrote, on, 8, february, to, burgoyne, your, visit, to, paris, has, produced, a, visible, change, in, the, emperor, s, views, and, he, is, making, every, preparation, for, a, land, expedition, in, case, the, last, attempt, at, negotiation, should, break, down, burgoyne, and, his, team, of, engineers, inspected, and, surveyed, the, dardanelles, area, in, february, they, were, fired, on, by, russian, riflemen, when, they, went, to, varna, a, team, of, sappers, arrived, in, march, and, major, building, works, commenced, on, a, seven, mile, line, of, defence, which, was, designed, to, block, the, gallipoli, peninsula, french, sappers, worked, on, half, of, the, line, which, was, finished, in, may, nicholas, felt, that, because, of, russian, assistance, in, suppressing, the, hungarian, revolution, of, 1848, austria, would, side, with, him, or, at, the, very, least, remain, neutral, austria, however, felt, threatened, by, the, russian, troops, in, the, balkans, on, 27, february, 1854, the, united, kingdom, and, france, demanded, the, withdrawal, of, russian, forces, from, the, principalities, austria, supported, them, and, without, declaring, war, on, russia, refused, to, guarantee, its, neutrality, russia, s, rejection, of, the, ultimatum, proved, to, be, the, justification, used, by, britain, and, france, to, enter, the, war, russia, soon, withdrew, its, troops, from, the, danubian, principalities, which, were, then, occupied, by, austria, for, the, duration, of, the, war, that, removed, the, original, grounds, for, war, but, the, british, and, the, french, continued, with, hostilities, determined, to, address, the, eastern, question, by, putting, an, end, to, the, russian, threat, to, the, ottomans, the, allies, in, august, 1854, proposed, the, four, points, for, ending, the, conflict, in, addition, to, the, russian, withdrawal, those, points, particularly, the, third, would, require, clarification, through, negotiations, which, russia, refused, the, allies, including, austria, therefore, agreed, that, britain, and, france, should, take, further, military, action, to, prevent, further, russian, aggression, against, the, ottomans, britain, and, france, agreed, on, the, invasion, of, crimea, as, the, first, step, the, danube, campaign, opened, when, the, russians, occupied, the, danubian, principalities, of, moldavia, and, wallachia, in, july, 1853, which, brought, their, forces, to, the, north, bank, of, the, river, danube, in, response, the, ottoman, empire, also, moved, its, forces, up, to, the, river, establishing, strongholds, at, vidin, in, the, west, and, silistra, in, the, east, near, the, mouth, of, the, danube, the, ottoman, move, up, the, river, danube, was, also, of, concern, to, the, austrians, who, moved, forces, into, transylvania, in, response, however, the, austrians, had, begun, to, fear, the, russians, more, than, the, ottomans, indeed, like, the, british, the, austrians, were, now, coming, to, see, that, an, intact, ottoman, empire, was, necessary, as, a, bulwark, against, the, russians, accordingly, austria, resisted, russian, diplomatic, attempts, to, join, the, war, but, remained, neutral, during, the, crimean, war, after, the, ottoman, ultimatum, in, september, 1853, forces, under, ottoman, general, omar, pasha, crossed, the, danube, at, vidin, and, captured, calafat, in, october, 1853, simultaneously, in, the, east, the, ottomans, crossed, the, danube, at, silistra, and, attacked, the, russians, at, olteni, a, the, resulting, battle, of, olteni, a, was, the, first, engagement, since, the, declaration, of, war, the, russians, counterattacked, but, were, beaten, back, on, 31, december, 1853, the, ottoman, forces, at, calafat, moved, against, the, russian, force, at, chetatea, or, cetate, a, small, village, nine, miles, north, of, calafat, and, engaged, it, on, 6, january, 1854, the, battle, began, when, the, russians, made, a, move, to, recapture, calafat, most, of, the, heavy, fighting, took, place, in, and, around, chetatea, until, the, russians, were, driven, out, of, the, village, despite, the, setback, at, chetatea, russian, forces, on, 28, january, 1854, laid, siege, to, calafat, the, siege, would, continue, until, may, 1854, when, it, was, lifted, by, the, russians, the, ottomans, would, also, later, beat, the, russians, in, battle, at, caracal, in, early, 1854, the, russians, again, advanced, by, crossing, the, river, danube, into, the, turkish, province, of, dobruja, by, april, 1854, the, russians, had, reached, the, lines, of, trajan, s, wall, where, they, were, finally, halted, in, the, centre, the, russian, forces, crossed, the, danube, and, laid, siege, to, silistra, from, 14, april, with, 60, 000, troops, the, defenders, had, 15, 000, troops, and, supplies, for, three, months, the, siege, was, lifted, on, 23, june, 1854, the, british, and, the, french, could, not, then, take, the, field, for, lack, of, equipment, in, the, west, the, russians, were, dissuaded, from, attacking, vidin, by, the, presence, of, the, austrian, forces, which, had, swollen, to, 280, 000, men, on, 28, may, 1854, a, protocol, of, the, vienna, conference, was, signed, by, austria, and, russia, one, of, the, aims, of, the, russian, advance, had, been, to, encourage, the, orthodox, christian, serbs, and, bulgarians, who, were, living, under, ottoman, rule, to, rebel, when, the, russian, troops, crossed, the, river, pruth, into, moldavia, the, orthodox, christians, showed, no, interest, in, rising, up, against, the, ottomans, adding, to, nicholas, i, s, worries, was, the, concern, that, austria, would, enter, the, war, against, the, russians, and, attack, his, armies, on, the, western, flank, indeed, after, attempting, to, mediate, a, peaceful, settlement, between, russia, and, the, ottomans, the, austrians, entered, the, war, on, the, side, of, the, ottomans, with, an, attack, against, the, russians, in, the, danubian, principalities, which, threatened, to, cut, off, the, russian, supply, lines, accordingly, the, russians, were, forced, to, raise, the, siege, of, silistra, on, 23, june, 1854, and, to, begin, abandoning, the, principalities, the, lifting, of, the, siege, reduced, the, threat, of, a, russian, advance, into, bulgaria, in, june, 1854, the, allied, expeditionary, force, landed, at, varna, a, city, on, the, black, sea, s, western, coast, but, made, little, advance, from, its, base, there, karl, marx, was, noted, to, have, quipped, that, there, they, are, the, french, doing, nothing, and, the, british, helping, them, as, fast, as, possible, in, july, 1854, the, ottomans, under, omar, pasha, crossed, the, danube, into, wallachia, and, on, 7, july, 1854, engaged, the, russians, in, the, city, of, giurgiu, and, conquered, it, the, capture, of, giurgiu, by, the, ottomans, immediately, threatened, bucharest, in, wallachia, with, capture, by, the, same, ottoman, army, on, 26, july, 1854, nicholas, i, responding, to, an, austrian, ultimatum, ordered, the, withdrawal, of, russian, troops, from, the, principalities, also, in, late, july, 1854, following, up, on, the, russian, retreat, the, french, staged, an, expedition, against, the, russian, forces, still, in, dobruja, but, it, was, a, failure, by, then, the, russian, withdrawal, was, complete, except, for, the, fortress, towns, of, northern, dobruja, and, russia, s, place, in, the, principalities, was, taken, by, the, austrians, as, a, neutral, peacekeeping, force, there, was, little, further, action, on, that, front, after, late, 1854, and, in, september, the, allied, force, boarded, ships, at, varna, to, invade, crimea, the, naval, operations, of, the, crimean, war, commenced, with, the, dispatch, in, mid, 1853, of, the, french, and, the, british, fleets, to, the, black, sea, region, to, support, the, ottomans, and, to, dissuade, the, russians, from, encroachment, by, june, 1853, both, fleets, had, been, stationed, at, besikas, bay, outside, the, dardanelles, with, the, russian, occupation, of, the, danube, principalities, in, july, 1853, they, moved, to, the, bosphorus, and, on, 3, january, 1854, they, entered, the, black, sea, meanwhile, the, russian, black, sea, fleet, operated, against, ottoman, coastal, traffic, between, constantinople, and, the, caucasus, ports, and, the, ottoman, fleet, sought, to, protect, the, supply, line, the, clash, came, on, 30, november, 1853, when, a, russian, fleet, attacked, an, ottoman, force, in, the, harbour, at, sinop, and, destroyed, it, at, the, battle, of, sinop, the, battle, outraged, british, public, opinion, which, called, for, war, there, was, little, additional, naval, action, until, march, 1854, when, after, the, declaration, of, war, the, british, frigate, hms, furious, was, fired, on, outside, odessa, harbour, in, response, an, anglo, french, fleet, bombarded, the, port, and, caused, much, damage, to, the, town, to, show, support, for, the, ottomans, after, the, battle, of, sinop, on, 22, december, 1853, the, anglo, french, squadron, entered, the, black, sea, and, the, steamship, hms, retribution, approached, the, port, of, sevastopol, its, commander, received, an, ultimatum, not, to, allow, any, ships, in, the, black, sea, in, june, the, fleets, transported, the, allied, expeditionary, forces, to, varna, to, support, the, ottoman, operations, on, the, danube, in, september, they, again, transported, the, armies, this, time, to, crimea, the, russian, fleet, then, declined, to, engage, the, allies, but, preferred, to, maintain, a, fleet, in, being, a, strategy, that, failed, when, sevastopol, the, main, port, and, the, base, of, most, of, the, black, sea, fleet, came, under, siege, the, russians, were, reduced, to, scuttling, their, warships, as, blockships, after, they, had, stripped, them, of, their, guns, and, men, to, reinforce, batteries, on, shore, during, the, siege, the, russians, lost, four, 110, or, 120, gun, three, decker, ships, of, the, line, twelve, 84, gun, two, deckers, and, four, 60, gun, frigates, in, the, black, sea, as, well, as, a, large, number, of, smaller, vessels, during, the, rest, of, the, campaign, the, allied, fleets, remained, in, control, of, the, black, sea, and, ensured, that, the, various, fronts, were, kept, supplied, in, may, 1855, the, allies, successfully, invaded, kerch, and, operated, against, taganrog, in, the, sea, of, azov, in, september, they, moved, against, russian, installations, in, the, dnieper, estuary, by, attacking, kinburn, in, the, first, use, of, ironclad, ships, in, naval, warfare, the, russians, evacuated, wallachia, and, moldavia, in, late, july, 1854, therefore, the, immediate, cause, of, war, had, now, been, withdrawn, and, the, war, might, have, then, ended, however, war, fever, among, the, public, in, both, britain, and, france, had, been, whipped, up, by, the, press, in, both, countries, to, the, degree, that, politicians, found, it, untenable, to, propose, immediately, ending, the, war, the, coalition, government, of, george, hamilton, gordon, 4th, earl, of, aberdeen, fell, on, 30, january, 1855, on, a, no, confidence, vote, as, parliament, voted, to, appoint, a, committee, to, investigate, the, mismanagement, of, the, war, french, and, british, officers, and, engineers, were, sent, on, 20, july, on, fury, a, wooden, bulldog, class, paddle, sloop, to, survey, the, harbour, of, sevastopol, and, the, coast, near, it, they, managed, to, get, close, to, the, harbour, mouth, to, inspect, the, formidable, batteries, returning, they, reported, that, they, believed, that, 15, 000, 20, 000, troops, were, encamped, ships, were, prepared, to, transport, horses, and, siege, equipment, was, both, manufactured, and, imported, the, crimean, campaign, opened, in, september, 1854, in, seven, columns, 360, ships, sailed, each, steamer, towing, two, sailing, ships, anchoring, on, 13, september, in, the, bay, of, yevpatoria, the, town, surrendered, and, 500, marines, landed, to, occupy, it, the, town, and, the, bay, would, provide, a, fallback, position, in, case, of, disaster, the, ships, then, sailed, east, to, make, the, landing, of, the, allied, expeditionary, force, on, the, sandy, beaches, of, kalamita, bay, on, the, south, west, coast, of, crimea, the, landing, surprised, the, russians, as, they, had, expected, a, landing, at, katcha, the, last, minute, change, proved, that, russia, had, known, the, original, campaign, plan, there, was, no, sign, of, the, enemy, and, so, all, of, the, invading, troops, landed, on, 14, september, 1854, it, took, another, four, days, to, land, all, of, the, stores, equipment, horses, and, artillery, the, landing, took, place, north, of, sevastopol, and, so, the, russians, had, arrayed, their, army, in, expectation, of, a, direct, attack, the, allies, advanced, and, on, the, morning, of, 20, september, came, up, to, the, river, alma, and, engaged, the, russian, army, the, russian, position, was, strong, but, after, three, hours, the, allied, frontal, attack, had, driven, the, russians, out, of, their, dug, in, positions, with, losses, of, 6, 000, men, the, battle, of, the, alma, resulted, in, 3, 300, allied, losses, failing, to, pursue, the, retreating, forces, was, one, of, many, strategic, errors, made, during, the, war, and, the, russians, themselves, noted, that, if, the, allies, had, pressed, south, that, day, they, would, have, easily, captured, sevastopol, believing, the, northern, approaches, to, the, city, too, well, defended, especially, because, of, the, presence, of, a, large, star, fort, and, the, city, being, on, the, south, side, of, sevastopol, bay, sir, john, burgoyne, the, engineer, advisor, recommended, for, the, allies, attack, to, sevastopol, from, the, south, the, joint, commanders, raglan, and, saint, arnaud, agreed, on, 25, september, the, whole, army, began, to, march, southeast, and, encircled, the, city, from, the, south, after, it, had, established, port, facilities, at, balaclava, for, the, british, and, at, kamiesch, russian, romanized, kamyshovaya, bukhta, for, the, french, the, russians, retreated, into, the, city, the, allied, armies, moved, without, problems, to, the, south, and, the, heavy, artillery, was, brought, ashore, with, batteries, and, connecting, trenches, built, by, 10, october, some, batteries, were, ready, and, by, 17, october, when, the, bombardment, commenced, 126, guns, were, firing, 53, of, them, french, the, fleet, meanwhile, engaged, the, shore, batteries, the, british, bombardment, worked, better, than, that, of, the, french, who, had, smaller, calibre, guns, the, fleet, suffered, high, casualties, during, the, day, the, british, wanted, to, attack, that, afternoon, but, the, french, wanted, to, defer, the, attack, a, postponement, was, agreed, but, on, the, next, day, the, french, were, still, not, ready, by, 19, october, the, russians, had, transferred, some, heavy, guns, to, the, southern, defences, and, had, outgunned, the, allies, reinforcements, for, the, russians, gave, them, the, courage, to, send, out, probing, attacks, the, allied, lines, beginning, to, suffer, from, cholera, as, early, as, september, were, stretched, the, french, on, the, west, had, less, to, do, than, the, british, on, the, east, with, their, siege, lines, and, the, large, nine, mile, open, wing, back, to, their, supply, base, on, the, south, coast, a, large, russian, assault, on, the, allied, supply, base, to, the, southeast, at, balaclava, was, rebuffed, on, 25, october, 1854, 521, 527, the, battle, of, balaclava, is, remembered, in, britain, for, the, actions, of, two, british, units, at, the, start, of, the, battle, a, large, body, of, russian, cavalry, charged, the, 93rd, highlanders, who, were, posted, north, of, the, village, of, kadikoi, commanding, them, was, sir, colin, campbell, rather, than, form, square, the, traditional, method, of, repelling, cavalry, campbell, took, the, risky, decision, to, have, his, highlanders, form, a, single, line, two, men, deep, campbell, had, seen, the, effectiveness, of, the, new, mini, rifles, with, which, his, troops, were, armed, at, the, battle, of, alma, a, month, earlier, and, he, was, confident, that, his, men, could, beat, back, the, russians, his, tactics, succeeded, from, up, on, the, ridge, to, the, west, times, correspondent, william, howard, russell, saw, the, highlanders, as, a, thin, red, streak, topped, with, steel, a, phrase, which, soon, became, the, thin, red, line, soon, afterward, a, russian, cavalry, movement, was, countered, by, the, heavy, brigade, which, charged, and, fought, hand, to, hand, until, the, russians, retreated, that, caused, a, more, widespread, russian, retreat, including, a, number, of, their, artillery, units, after, the, local, commanders, had, failed, to, take, advantage, of, the, retreat, lord, raglan, sent, out, orders, to, move, up, and, to, prevent, the, withdrawal, of, naval, guns, from, the, recently, captured, redoubts, on, the, heights, raglan, could, see, those, guns, because, of, his, position, on, the, hill, in, the, valley, that, view, was, obstructed, and, the, wrong, guns, were, in, sight, to, the, left, the, local, commanders, ignored, the, demands, which, led, to, the, british, aide, de, camp, captain, louis, nolan, personally, delivering, the, quickly, written, and, confusing, order, to, attack, the, artillery, when, lord, lucan, questioned, to, which, guns, the, order, referred, the, aide, de, camp, pointed, to, the, first, russian, battery, that, he, could, see, and, allegedly, said, there, is, your, enemy, there, are, your, guns, because, of, his, obstructed, view, which, were, wrong, lucan, then, passed, the, order, to, the, earl, of, cardigan, which, resulted, in, the, charge, of, the, light, brigade, in, that, charge, cardigan, formed, up, his, unit, and, charged, the, length, of, the, valley, of, the, balaclava, under, fire, from, russian, batteries, in, the, hills, the, charge, of, the, light, brigade, caused, 278, casualties, of, the, 700, man, unit, the, light, brigade, was, memorialised, in, the, famous, poem, by, alfred, lord, tennyson, the, charge, of, the, light, brigade, although, traditionally, the, charge, of, the, light, brigade, was, looked, upon, as, a, glorious, but, wasted, sacrifice, of, good, men, and, horses, recent, historians, believe, that, the, charge, of, the, light, brigade, succeeded, in, at, least, some, of, its, objectives, the, aim, of, any, cavalry, charge, is, to, scatter, the, enemy, s, lines, and, frighten, the, enemy, off, the, battlefield, the, charge, of, the, light, brigade, so, unnerved, the, russian, cavalry, which, had, been, routed, by, the, charge, of, the, heavy, brigade, that, the, russians, were, set, to, full, scale, flight, the, shortage, of, men, led, to, the, failure, of, the, british, and, the, french, to, follow, up, on, the, battle, of, balaclava, which, led, directly, to, the, much, bloodier, battle, of, inkerman, on, 5, november, 1854, the, russians, attempted, to, raise, the, siege, at, sevastopol, with, an, attack, against, the, allies, which, resulted, in, another, allied, victory, winter, weather, and, a, deteriorating, supply, of, troops, and, materiel, on, both, sides, led, to, a, halt, in, ground, operations, sevastopol, remained, invested, by, the, allies, whose, armies, were, hemmed, in, by, the, imperial, russian, army, in, the, interior, on, 14, november, the, balaklava, storm, a, major, weather, event, sank, 30, allied, transport, ships, including, hms, prince, which, was, carrying, a, cargo, of, winter, clothing, the, storm, and, the, heavy, traffic, caused, the, road, from, the, coast, to, the, troops, to, disintegrate, into, a, quagmire, which, required, engineers, to, devote, most, of, their, time, to, its, repair, including, by, quarrying, stone, a, tramway, was, ordered, and, arrived, in, january, with, a, civilian, engineering, crew, but, it, took, until, march, before, it, had, become, sufficiently, advanced, to, be, of, any, appreciable, value, an, electrical, telegraph, was, also, ordered, but, the, frozen, ground, delayed, its, installation, until, march, when, communications, from, the, base, port, of, balaklava, to, the, british, hq, was, established, the, pipe, and, cable, laying, plough, failed, because, of, the, hard, frozen, soil, but, nevertheless, 21, miles, 34, km, of, cable, were, laid, the, troops, suffered, greatly, from, cold, and, sickness, and, the, shortage, of, fuel, led, them, to, start, dismantling, their, defensive, gabions, and, fascines, in, february, 1855, the, russians, attacked, the, allied, base, at, eupatoria, where, an, ottoman, army, had, built, up, and, was, threatening, russian, supply, routes, the, russians, were, defeated, at, the, battle, of, eupatoria, leading, to, a, change, in, their, command, the, strain, of, directing, the, war, had, taken, its, toll, on, the, health, of, tsar, nicholas, full, of, remorse, for, the, disasters, that, he, had, caused, he, caught, pneumonia, and, died, on, 2, march, 96, the, allies, had, had, time, to, consider, the, problem, and, the, french, were, brought, around, to, agree, that, the, key, to, the, defence, was, the, malakoff, emphasis, of, the, siege, at, sevastopol, shifted, to, the, british, left, against, the, fortifications, on, malakoff, hill, in, march, there, was, fighting, by, the, french, over, a, new, fort, being, built, by, the, russians, at, mamelon, on, a, hill, in, front, of, the, malakoff, several, weeks, of, fighting, resulted, in, little, change, in, the, front, line, and, the, mamelon, remained, in, russian, hands, in, april, 1855, the, allies, staged, a, second, all, out, bombardment, which, led, to, an, artillery, duel, with, the, russian, guns, but, no, ground, assault, followed, on, 24, may, 1855, 60, ships, containing, 7, 000, french, 5, 000, turkish, and, 3, 000, british, troops, set, off, for, a, raid, on, the, city, of, kerch, east, of, sevastopol, in, an, attempt, to, open, another, front, in, crimea, and, to, cut, off, russian, supplies, when, the, allies, landed, the, force, at, kerch, the, plan, was, to, outflank, the, russian, army, the, landings, were, successful, but, the, force, made, little, progress, thereafter, many, more, artillery, pieces, had, arrived, and, had, been, dug, into, batteries, the, first, general, assault, of, sevastopol, took, place, on, 18, june, 1855, there, is, a, legend, that, the, assault, was, scheduled, for, that, date, in, favour, of, napoleon, iii, in, the, 40th, anniversary, of, the, battle, of, waterloo, but, the, legend, is, not, confirmed, by, historians, however, the, appearance, of, such, a, legend, is, undoubtedly, symptomatic, since, the, war, in, france, was, understood, as, a, certain, revanche, for, the, defeat, of, 1812, in, june, a, third, bombardment, was, followed, after, two, days, by, a, successful, attack, on, the, mamelon, but, a, follow, up, assault, on, the, malakoff, failed, with, heavy, losses, meanwhile, the, garrison, commander, admiral, pavel, nakhimov, fell, on, 30, june, 1855, and, raglan, died, on, 28, june, losses, in, those, battles, were, so, great, that, by, agreement, of, military, opponents, short, term, truces, for, removal, of, corpses, were, signed, these, truces, were, described, in, the, work, of, leo, tolstoy, sevastopol, sketches, the, assault, was, beaten, back, with, heavy, casualties, and, in, an, undoubted, victory, for, russia, it, is, worth, mentioning, that, the, russian, siege, of, sevastopol, panorama, depicts, the, moment, of, the, assault, of, sevastopol, on, 18, june, 1855, in, august, the, russians, again, made, an, attack, towards, the, base, at, balaclava, which, was, defended, by, the, french, newly, arrived, sardinian, and, ottoman, troops, the, resulting, battle, of, the, chernaya, was, a, defeat, for, the, russians, who, suffered, heavy, casualties, for, months, each, side, had, been, building, forward, rifle, pits, and, defensive, positions, which, resulted, in, many, skirmishes, artillery, fire, aimed, to, gain, superiority, over, the, enemy, guns, the, final, assault, was, made, on, 5, september, when, another, french, bombardment, the, sixth, was, followed, by, an, assault, by, the, french, army, on, 8, september, and, resulted, in, the, french, capture, of, the, malakoff, fort, the, russians, failed, to, retake, it, and, their, defences, collapsed, meanwhile, the, british, assaulted, the, great, redan, a, russian, defensive, battlement, just, south, of, the, city, of, sevastopol, a, position, that, had, been, attacked, repeatedly, for, months, whether, the, british, captured, the, redan, remains, in, dispute, russian, historians, recognise, only, the, loss, of, the, malakhov, kurgan, a, key, point, of, defence, claiming, that, all, other, positions, were, retained, what, is, agreed, is, that, the, russians, abandoned, the, positions, blew, up, their, powder, magazines, and, retreated, to, the, north, the, city, finally, fell, on, 9, september, 1855, after, a, 337, day, long, siege, 106, both, sides, were, now, exhausted, and, no, further, military, operations, were, launched, in, crimea, before, the, onset, of, winter, the, main, objective, of, the, siege, was, the, destruction, of, the, russian, fleet, and, docks, and, took, place, over, the, winter, on, 28, february, multiple, mines, blew, up, the, five, docks, the, canal, and, three, locks, in, early, 1855, the, allied, anglo, french, commanders, decided, to, send, an, anglo, french, naval, squadron, into, the, azov, sea, to, undermine, russian, communications, and, supplies, to, besieged, sevastopol, on, 12, may, 1855, anglo, french, warships, entered, the, kerch, strait, and, destroyed, the, coast, battery, of, the, kamishevaya, bay, once, through, the, kerch, strait, british, and, french, warships, struck, at, every, vestige, of, russian, power, along, the, coast, of, the, sea, of, azov, except, for, rostov, and, azov, no, town, depot, building, or, fortification, was, immune, from, attack, and, russian, naval, power, ceased, to, exist, almost, overnight, this, allied, campaign, led, to, a, significant, reduction, in, supplies, flowing, to, the, besieged, russian, troops, at, sevastopol, on, 21, may, 1855, the, gunboats, and, armed, steamers, attacked, the, seaport, of, taganrog, the, most, important, hub, near, rostov, on, don, the, vast, amounts, of, food, especially, bread, wheat, barley, and, rye, that, were, amassed, in, the, city, after, the, outbreak, of, war, were, prevented, from, being, exported, the, governor, of, taganrog, yegor, tolstoy, and, lieutenant, general, ivan, krasnov, refused, an, allied, ultimatum, by, responding, russians, never, surrender, their, cities, the, anglo, french, squadron, bombarded, taganrog, for, 6, 1, 2, hours, and, landed, 300, troops, near, the, old, stairway, in, the, centre, of, taganrog, but, they, were, thrown, back, by, don, cossacks, and, a, volunteer, corps, in, july, 1855, the, allied, squadron, tried, to, go, past, taganrog, to, rostov, on, don, by, entering, the, river, don, through, the, mius, river, on, 12, july, 1855, hms, jasper, grounded, near, taganrog, thanks, to, a, fisherman, who, moved, buoys, into, shallow, water, the, cossacks, captured, the, gunboat, with, all, of, its, guns, and, blew, it, up, the, third, siege, attempt, was, made, 19, 31, august, 1855, but, the, city, was, already, fortified, and, the, squadron, could, not, approach, close, enough, for, landing, operations, the, allied, fleet, left, the, gulf, of, taganrog, on, 2, september, 1855, with, minor, military, operations, along, the, azov, sea, coast, continuing, until, late, 1855, as, in, the, previous, wars, the, caucasus, front, was, secondary, to, what, happened, in, the, west, perhaps, because, of, better, communications, western, events, sometimes, influenced, the, east, the, main, events, were, the, second, capture, of, kars, and, a, landing, on, the, georgian, coast, several, commanders, on, both, sides, were, either, incompetent, or, unlucky, and, few, fought, aggressively, 1853, there, were, four, main, events, 1, in, the, north, the, ottomans, captured, the, border, fort, of, saint, nicholas, in, a, surprise, night, attack, 27, 28, october, they, then, pushed, about, 20, 000, troops, across, the, choloki, river, border, being, outnumbered, the, russians, abandoned, poti, and, redoubt, kali, and, drew, back, to, marani, both, sides, remained, immobile, for, the, next, seven, months, 2, in, the, centre, the, ottomans, moved, north, from, ardahan, to, within, cannon, shot, of, akhaltsike, and, awaited, reinforcements, 13, november, but, the, russians, routed, them, the, claimed, losses, were, 4, 000, turks, and, 400, russians, 3, in, the, south, about, 30, 000, turks, slowly, moved, east, to, the, main, russian, concentration, at, gyumri, or, alexandropol, november, they, crossed, the, border, and, set, up, artillery, south, of, town, prince, vakhtang, orbeliani, tried, to, drive, them, off, and, found, himself, trapped, the, ottomans, failed, to, press, their, advantage, the, remaining, russians, rescued, orbeliani, and, the, ottomans, retired, west, orbeliani, lost, about, 1, 000, men, from, 5, 000, the, russians, now, decided, to, advance, the, ottomans, took, up, a, strong, position, on, the, kars, road, and, attacked, only, to, be, defeated, in, the, battle, of, ba, gedikler, losing, 6, 000, men, half, their, artillery, and, all, of, their, supply, train, the, russians, lost, 1, 300, including, prince, orbeliani, this, was, prince, ellico, orbeliani, whose, wife,

declared, war, on, 28, march, early, in, the, year, on, 3, january, the, anglo, french, fleet, appeared, in, the, black, sea, and, the, russians, abandoned, the, black, sea, defensive, line, from, anapa, south, nikolay, muravyov, who, replaced, vorontsov, fearing, an, anglo, french, landing, in, conjunction, with, shamil, 3rd, imam, of, dagestan, and, the, persians, recommended, withdrawal, north, of, the, caucasus, for, that, purpose, he, was, replaced, by, aleksandr, baryatinsky, when, the, allies, chose, a, land, attack, on, sevastopol, any, plan, for, a, landing, in, the, east, was, abandoned, in, the, north, georgiy, evseevich, eristov, pushed, southwest, fought, two, battles, forced, the, ottomans, back, to, batumi, retired, behind, the, cholok, river, and, suspended, action, for, the, rest, of, the, year, june, in, the, far, south, wrangel, pushed, west, fought, a, battle, and, occupied, bayazit, in, the, centre, the, main, forces, stood, at, kars, and, gyumri, both, slowly, approached, along, the, kars, gyumri, road, and, faced, each, other, neither, side, choosing, to, fight, june, july, on, 4, august, russian, scouts, saw, a, movement, which, they, thought, was, the, start, of, a, withdrawal, the, russians, advanced, and, the, ottomans, attacked, first, they, were, defeated, and, lost, 8, 000, men, to, the, russian, 3, 000, also, 10, 000, irregulars, deserted, to, their, villages, both, sides, withdrew, to, their, former, positions, about, then, the, persians, made, a, semi, secret, agreement, to, remain, neutral, in, exchange, for, the, cancellation, of, the, indemnity, from, the, previous, war, 1855, siege, of, kars, up, to, may, 1855, ottomans, forces, in, the, east, were, reduced, from, 120, 000, to, 75, 000, mostly, by, disease, the, local, armenian, population, kept, muravyov, well, informed, about, the, ottomans, at, kars, and, he, judged, they, had, about, five, months, of, supplies, he, therefore, decided, to, control, the, surrounding, area, with, cavalry, and, starve, them, out, he, started, in, may, and, by, june, was, south, and, west, of, the, town, a, relieving, force, fell, back, and, there, was, a, possibility, of, taking, erzurum, but, muravyov, chose, not, to, in, late, september, he, learned, of, the, fall, of, sevastopol, and, a, turkish, landing, at, batum, this, led, him, to, reverse, policy, and, try, a, direct, attack, it, failed, the, russians, losing, 8, 000, men, and, the, turks, 1, 500, 29, september, the, blockade, continued, and, kars, surrendered, on, 28, november, 1855, georgian, coast, omar, pasha, the, turkish, commander, at, crimea, had, long, wanted, to, land, in, georgia, but, the, western, powers, vetoed, it, when, they, relented, in, august, most, of, the, campaigning, season, was, lost, in, 8, september, turks, landed, at, batum, but, the, main, concentration, was, at, sukhum, kale, this, required, a, 100, mile, march, south, through, a, country, with, poor, roads, in, essence, it, was, a, military, demonstration, in, order, to, frighten, the, russian, command, and, force, it, to, lift, the, siege, of, the, fortress, of, kars, all, luck, depended, on, whether, muravyov, the, russian, commander, would, be, scared, or, not, but, the, russian, command, did, not, see, a, serious, threat, the, siege, of, kars, was, continued, the, russians, planned, to, hold, the, line, of, the, ingur, river, which, separates, abkhazia, from, georgia, proper, omar, crossed, the, ingur, on, 7, november, and, then, wasted, a, great, deal, of, time, the, russians, doing, little, by, 2, december, he, had, reached, the, tskhenistsqali, the, rainy, season, had, started, his, camps, were, submerged, in, mud, and, there, was, no, bread, learning, of, the, fall, of, kars, he, withdrew, to, the, ingur, the, russians, did, nothing, and, he, evacuated, to, batum, in, february, of, the, following, year, the, baltic, was, a, forgotten, theatre, of, the, crimean, war, popularisation, of, events, elsewhere, overshadowed, the, significance, of, this, theatre, which, was, close, to, saint, petersburg, the, russian, capital, in, april, 1854, an, anglo, french, fleet, entered, the, baltic, to, attack, the, russian, naval, base, of, kronstadt, and, the, russian, fleet, that, was, stationed, there, in, august, 1854, the, combined, british, and, french, fleet, returned, to, kronstadt, for, another, attempt, the, outnumbered, russian, baltic, fleet, confined, its, movements, to, the, areas, around, its, fortifications, at, the, same, time, the, british, and, french, commanders, sir, charles, napier, and, alexandre, ferdinand, parseval, deschenes, although, they, led, the, largest, fleet, assembled, since, the, napoleonic, wars, considered, the, sveaborg, fortress, too, well, defended, to, engage, thus, shelling, of, the, russian, batteries, was, limited, to, two, attempts, in, 1854, and, 1855, and, initially, the, attacking, fleets, limited, their, actions, to, blockading, russian, trade, in, the, gulf, of, finland, naval, attacks, on, other, ports, such, as, the, ones, in, the, island, of, hogland, in, the, gulf, of, finland, proved, more, successful, additionally, allies, conducted, raids, on, less, fortified, sections, of, the, finnish, coast, these, battles, are, known, in, finland, as, the, land, war, russia, depended, on, imports, both, for, its, domestic, economy, and, for, the, supply, of, its, military, forces, the, blockade, forced, russia, to, rely, on, more, expensive, overland, shipments, from, prussia, the, blockade, seriously, undermined, the, russian, export, economy, and, helped, shorten, the, war, the, burning, of, tar, warehouses, and, ships, led, to, international, criticism, and, in, london, the, mp, thomas, milner, gibson, demanded, in, the, house, of, commons, that, the, first, lord, of, the, admiralty, explain, a, system, which, carried, on, a, great, war, by, plundering, and, destroying, the, property, of, defenceless, villagers, in, fact, the, operations, in, the, baltic, sea, were, in, the, nature, of, binding, forces, it, was, very, important, to, divert, russian, forces, from, the, south, or, more, precisely, not, to, allow, nicholas, to, transfer, to, crimea, a, huge, army, guarding, the, baltic, coast, and, the, capital, this, goal, anglo, french, forces, achieved, the, russian, army, in, crimea, was, forced, to, act, without, superiority, in, forces, in, august, 1854, a, franco, british, naval, force, captured, and, destroyed, the, russian, bomarsund, fortress, on, land, islands, in, the, august, 1855, the, western, allied, baltic, fleet, tried, to, destroy, heavily, defended, russian, dockyards, at, sveaborg, outside, helsinki, more, than, 1, 000, enemy, guns, tested, the, strength, of, the, fortress, for, two, days, despite, the, shelling, the, sailors, of, the, 120, gun, ship, rossiya, led, by, captain, viktor, poplonsky, defended, the, entrance, to, the, harbour, the, allies, fired, over, 20, 000, shells, but, failed, to, defeat, the, russian, batteries, the, british, then, built, a, massive, new, fleet, of, more, than, 350, gunboats, and, mortar, vessels, which, was, known, as, the, great, armament, but, the, war, ended, before, the, attack, was, launched, part, of, the, russian, resistance, was, credited, to, the, deployment, of, newly, invented, naval, mines, perhaps, the, most, influential, contributor, to, the, development, of, naval, mining, was, a, swede, resident, in, russia, the, inventor, and, civil, engineer, immanuel, nobel, the, father, of, alfred, nobel, immanuel, nobel, helped, the, russian, war, effort, by, applying, his, knowledge, of, industrial, explosives, such, as, nitroglycerin, and, gunpowder, an, account, given, in, 1860, by, united, states, army, major, richard, delafield, dates, modern, naval, mining, to, the, crimean, war, torpedo, mines, if, i, may, use, this, name, given, by, fulton, to, self, acting, mines, underwater, were, among, the, novelties, attempted, by, the, russians, in, their, defenses, about, cronstadt, and, sevastopol, for, the, campaign, of, 1856, britain, and, france, planned, an, attack, on, the, main, base, of, the, russian, navy, in, the, baltic, sea, kronstadt, the, attack, was, to, be, carried, out, using, armoured, floating, batteries, the, use, of, the, latter, proved, to, be, highly, effective, in, the, attack, on, kinburn, on, the, black, sea, in, 1855, undoubtedly, this, threat, contributed, on, the, part, of, russia, the, decision, on, the, conclusion, of, peace, on, unfavourable, terms, in, late, 1854, a, squadron, of, three, british, warships, led, by, hms, miranda, left, the, baltic, for, the, white, sea, where, they, shelled, kola, which, was, destroyed, and, the, solovki, minor, naval, skirmishes, also, occurred, in, the, far, east, where, at, petropavlovsk, on, the, kamchatka, peninsula, a, british, and, french, allied, squadron, including, hms, pique, under, rear, admiral, david, price, and, a, french, force, under, counter, admiral, auguste, febvrier, despointes, besieged, a, smaller, russian, force, under, rear, admiral, yevfimiy, putyatin, in, september, 1854, an, allied, landing, force, was, beaten, back, with, heavy, casualties, and, the, allies, withdrew, the, victory, at, petropavlovsk, was, for, russia, in, the, words, of, the, future, minister, of, war, dmitry, milyutin, a, ray, of, light, among, the, dark, clouds, the, russians, escaped, under, the, cover, of, snow, in, early, 1855, after, allied,

and, british, forces, during, the, war, this, was, an, attempt, at, gaining, the, favour, of, the, french, especially, when, the, issue, of, uniting, italy, would, become, an, important, matter, the, deployment, of, italian, troops, to, crimea, and, the, gallantry, shown, by, them, in, the, battle, of, the, chernaya, 16, august, 1855, and, in, the, siege, of, sevastopol, allowed, the, kingdom, of, sardinia, to, be, among, the, participants, at, the, peace, conference, at, the, end, of, the, war, where, it, could, address, the, issue, of, the, risorgimento, to, other, european, powers, greece,

that, had, large, greek, christian, majorities, greece, did, not, coordinate, its, plans, with, russia, did, not, declare, war, and, received, no, outside, military, or, financial, support, greece, an, orthodox, nation, had, considerable, support, in, russia, but, the, russian, government, decided, it, was, too, dangerous, to, help, greece, expand, its, holdings, when, the, russians, invaded, the, principalities, the, ottoman, forces, were, tied, down, so, greece, invaded, thessaly, and, epirus, to, block, further, greek, moves, the, british, and, french, occupied, the, main, greek, port,

peace, conference, and, made, no, gains, out, of, the, war, the, frustrated, greek, leadership, blamed, the, king, for, failing, to, take, advantage, of, the, situation, his, popularity, plunged, and, he, was, forced, to, abdicate, in, 1862, in, addition, a, 1, 000, strong, greek, volunteer, legion, was, formed, in, the, danubian, principalities, in, 1854, and, later, fought, at, sevastopol, a, peasant, revolt, that, began, in, the, vasylkiv, county, of, kiev, governorate, province, in, february, 1855, spread, across, the, whole, kiev, and, chernigov, governorates, with, peasants, refusing, to, participate, in, corv, e, labour, and, other, orders, of, the, local, authorities, and, in, some, cases, attacking, priests, who, were, accused, of, hiding, a, decree, about, the, liberation, of, the, peasants, dissatisfaction, with, the, conduct, of, the, war, was, growing, with, the, public, in, britain, and, other, countries, and, was, worsened, by, reports, of, fiascos, especially, the, devastating, losses, of, the, charge, of, the, light, brigade, at, the, battle, of, balaclava, on, sunday, 21, january, 1855, a, snowball, riot, occurred, in, trafalgar, square, near, st, martin, in,

far, more, soldiers, to, the, war, and, suffered, far, more, casualties, than, britain, had, wanted, the, war, to, end, as, did, austria, negotiations, began, in, paris, in, february, 1856, and, were, surprisingly, easy, france, under, the, leadership, of, napoleon, iii, had, no, special, interests, in, the, black, sea, and, so, did, not, support, the, harsh, british, and, austrian, proposals, peace, negotiations, at, the, congress, of, paris, resulted, in, the, signing, of, the, treaty, of, paris, on, 30, march, 1856, in, compliance, with, article, iii, russia, restored, to, the, ottoman,

wallachia, were, nominally, returned, to, the, ottoman, empire, and, the, austrian, empire, was, forced, to, abandon, its, annexation, and, to, end, its, occupation, of, them, but, they, in, practice, became, independent, the, treaty, of, paris, admitted, the, ottoman, empire, to, the, concert, of, europe, and, the, great, powers, pledged, to, respect, its, independence, and, territorial, integrity, some, members, of, the, russian, intelligentsia, saw, defeat, as, a, pressure, to, modernise, their, society, grand, duke, constantine, a, son, of, the, tsar, remarked, we, cannot, deceive, ourselves, any, longer, we, must, say, that, we, are, both, weaker, and, poorer, than, the, first, class, powers, and, furthermore, poorer, not, only, in, material, terms, but, in, mental, resources, especially, in, matters, of, administration, orlando, figes, points, to, the, long, term, damage, russia, suffered, the, demilitarization, of, the, black, sea, was, a, major, blow, to, russia, which, was, no, longer, able, to, protect, its, vulnerable, southern, coastal, frontier, against, the, british, or, any, other, fleet, the, destruction, of, the, russian, black, sea, fleet, sevastopol, and, other, naval, docks, was, a, humiliation, no, compulsory, disarmament, had, ever, been, imposed, on, a, great, power, previously, the, allies, did, not, really, think, that, they, were, dealing, with, a, european, power, in, russia, they, regarded, russia, as, a, semi, asiatic, state, in, russia, itself, the, crimean, defeat, discredited, the, armed, services, and, highlighted, the, need, to, modernize, the, country, s, defences, not, just, in, the, strictly, military, sense, but, also, through, the, building, of, railways, industrialization, sound, finances, and, so, on, the, image, many, russians, had, built, up, of, their, country, the, biggest, richest, and, most, powerful, in, the, world, had, suddenly, been, shattered, russia, s, backwardness, had, been, exposed, the, crimean, disaster, had, exposed, the, shortcomings, of, every, institution, in, russia, not, just, the, corruption, and, incompetence, of, the, military, command, the, technological, backwardness, of, the, army, and, navy, or, the, inadequate, roads, and, lack, of, railways, that, accounted, for, the, chronic, problems, of, supply, but, the, poor, condition, and, illiteracy, of, the, serfs, who, made, up, the, armed, forces, the, inability, of, the, serf, economy, to, sustain, a, state, of, war, against, industrial, powers, and, the, failures, of, autocracy, itself, the, treaty, of, paris, stood, until, 1871, when, prussia, defeated, france, in, the, franco, prussian, war, of, 1870, 71, while, prussia, and, several, other, german, states, united, to, form, a, powerful, german, empire, in, january, 1871, the, french, deposed, emperor, napoleon, iii, and, proclaimed, the, french, third, republic, september, 1870, during, his, reign, napoleon, eager, for, the, support, of, the, united, kingdom, had, opposed, russia, over, the, eastern, question, russian, interference, in, the, ottoman, empire, did, not, in, any, significant, manner, threaten, the, interests, of, france, kissinger, uses, napoleon, s, pandering, to, journalists, and, public, opinion, on, this, subject, at, the, expense, of, the, true, interests, of, france, as, an, example, of, strategic, frivolity, and, france, abandoned, its, opposition, to, russia, after, the, establishment, of, the, republic, encouraged, by, the, new, attitude, of, french, diplomacy, after, the, surrenders, of, the, besieged, french, army, at, sedan, and, later, metz, and, supported, by, the, german, chancellor, otto, von, bismarck, russia, in, october, 1870, renounced, the, black, sea, clauses, of, the, treaty, agreed, to, in, 1856, as, the, united, kingdom, with, austria, hungary, could, not, enforce, the, clauses, russia, once, again, established, a, fleet, in, the, black, sea, after, being, defeated, in, the, crimean, war, russia, feared, that, russian, alaska, would, be, easily, captured, in, any, future, war, with, the, british, therefore, alexander, ii, opted, to, sell, the, territory, to, the, united, states, a, greek, tortoise, named, timothy, was, found, on, a, portuguese, ship, by, captain, john, guy, courtenay, everard, on, hms, queen, in, 1854, serving, as, a, mascot, throughout, the, war, when, she, died, in, 2004, this, made, her, the, last, living, veteran, of, the, crimean, war, historian, norman, rich, argues, that, the, war, was, not, an, accident, but, was, sought, out, by, the, determination, of, the, british, and, french, not, to, allow, russia, an, honourable, retreat, both, insisted, on, a, military, victory, to, enhance, their, prestige, in, european, affairs, when, a, non, violent, peaceful, political, solution, was, available, the, war, then, wrecked, the, concert, of, europe, which, had, long, kept, the, peace, turkish, historian, candan, badem, wrote, victory, in, this, war, did, not, bring, any, significant, material, gain, not, even, a, war, indemnity, on, the, other, hand, the, ottoman, treasury, was, nearly, bankrupted, due, to, war, expenses, badem, adds, that, the, ottomans, achieved, no, significant, territorial, gains, lost, the, right, to, a, navy, in, the, black, sea, and, failed, to, gain, status, as, a, great, power, further, the, war, gave, impetus, to, the, union, of, the, danubian, principalities, and, ultimately, to, their, independence, the, treaty, punished, the, defeated, russia, but, in, the, long, run, austria, lost, the, most, from, the, war, despite, having, barely, taken, part, in, it, having, abandoned, its, alliance, with, russia, austria, remained, diplomatically, isolated, following, the, war, which, contributed, to, its, disastrous, defeats, in, the, 1859, franco, austrian, war, that, resulted, in, the, cession, of, lombardy, to, the, kingdom, of, sardinia, and, later, in, the, loss, of, the, habsburg, rule, of, tuscany, and, modena, which, meant, the, end, of, austrian, influence, in, peninsular, italy, furthermore, russia, did, not, do, anything, to, assist, its, former, ally, austria, in, the, 1866, austro, prussian, war, when, austria, lost, venetia, and, more, importantly, its, influence, in, most, german, speaking, lands, the, status, of, austria, as, a, great, power, with, the, unifications, of, germany, and, italy, now, became, very, precarious, it, had, to, compromise, with, hungary, the, two, countries, shared, the, danubian, empire, with, france, now, hostile, to, germany, and, gravitating, towards, russia, and, with, russia, competing, with, the, newly, renamed, austro, hungarian, empire, for, an, increased, role, in, the, balkans, at, the, expense, of, the, ottoman, empire, the, foundations, were, in, place, for, building, the, diplomatic, alliances, that, would, shape, the, first, world, war, the, treaty, s, guarantees, to, preserve, ottoman, territories, were, broken, 21, years, later, when, russia, exploiting, nationalist, unrest, in, the, balkans, and, seeking, to, regain, lost, prestige, once, again, declared, war, on, the, ottoman, empire, on, 24, april, 1877, in, this, later, russo, turkish, war, the, states, of, romania, serbia, and, montenegro, gained, international, recognition, of, their, independence, and, bulgaria, achieved, its, autonomy, from, direct, ottoman, rule, russia, took, over, southern, bessarabia, lost, in, 1856, the, regions, of, batum, and, kars, as, well, as, those, inhabited, by, adjarians, muslim, georgians, and, armenians, were, also, annexed, to, russia, in, the, caucasus, at, the, same, time, protectors, of, the, ottoman, empire, britain, received, cyprus, as, a, colonial, possession, while, austria, hungary, occupied, and, annexed, bosnia, and, herzegovina, in, 1908, finally, ottoman, rule, in, the, balkans, ended, after, the, first, balkan, war, of, 1912, when, the, combined, forces, of, the, balkan, states, defeated, it, the, crimean, war, marked, the, re, ascendancy, of, france, to, the, position, of, pre, eminent, power, on, the, continent, the, continued, decline, of, the, ottoman, empire, and, a, period, of, crisis, for, imperial, russia, as, fuller, notes, russia, had, been, beaten, on, the, crimean, peninsula, and, the, military, feared, that, it, would, inevitably, be, beaten, again, unless, steps, were, taken, to, surmount, its, military, weakness, to, compensate, for, its, defeat, in, the, crimean, war, the, russian, empire, then, embarked, in, more, intensive, expansion, in, asia, partially, to, restore, national, pride, and, partially, to, distract, britain, on, the, world, stage, intensifying, the, great, game, the, war, also, marked, the, demise, of, the, first, phase, of, the, concert, of, europe, the, balance, of, power, system, that, had, dominated, europe, since, the, congress, of, vienna, in, 1815, and, had, included, france, russia, prussia, austria, and, the, united, kingdom, from, 1854, to, 1871, the, concert, of, europe, concept, was, weakened, leading, to, the, crises, that, were, the, unifications, of, germany, and, of, italy, before, a, resurgence, of, great, power, conferences, in, 1870, prussia, persuaded, russia, to, remain, neutral, in, the, franco, prussian, war, bismarck, having, declared, it, impossible, to, keep, 100, million, russians, in, a, humiliated, position, without, sovereign, rights, to, their, black, sea, coastline, supported, russia, against, the, treaty, of, paris, and, in, return, prussia, achieved, freedom, of, action, against, france, in, 1870, 71, and, inflicted, a, crushing, defeat, on, it, according, to, historian, shepard, clough, the, war, was, not, the, result, of, a, calculated, plan, nor, even, of, hasty, last, minute, decisions, made, under, stress, it, was, the, consequence, of, more, than, two, years, of, fatal, blundering, in, slow, motion, by, inept, statesmen, who, had, months, to, reflect, upon, the, actions, they, took, it, arose, from, napoleon, s, search, for, prestige, nicholas, s, quest, for, control, over, the, straits, his, na, ve, miscalculation, of, the, probable, reactions, of, the, european, powers, the, failure, of, those, powers, to, make, their, positions, clear, and, the, pressure, of, public, opinion, in, britain, and, constantinople, at, crucial, moments, the, view, of, diplomatic, drift, as, the, cause, of, the, war, was, first, popularised, by, a, w, kinglake, who, portrayed, the, british, as, victims, of, newspaper, sensationalism, and, duplicitous, french, and, ottoman, diplomacy, more, recently, historians, andrew, lambert, and, winfried, baumgart, have, argued, that, britain, was, following, a, geopolitical, strategy, in, aiming, to, destroy, the, fledgling, russian, navy, which, might, challenge, the, royal, navy, for, control, of, the, seas, and, that, the, war, was, also, a, joint, european, response, to, a, century, of, russian, expansion, not, just, southwards, but, also, into, western, europe, documentation, of, the, war, was, provided, by, william, howard, russell, who, wrote, for, the, times, newspaper, and, by, roger, fenton, s, photographs, news, from, war, correspondents, reached, all, of, the, nations, involved, in, the, war, and, kept, the, public, citizenry, of, those, nations, better, informed, of, the, day, to, day, events, of, the, war, than, had, been, the, case, in, any, earlier, war, the, british, public, was, very, well, informed, on, the, day, to, day, realities, of, the, war, after, the, french, extended, the, telegraph, to, the, coast, of, the, black, sea, in, late, 1854, news, reached, london, in, two, days, when, the, british, laid, an, underwater, cable, to, crimea, in, april, 1855, news, reached, london, in, a, few, hours, the, daily, news, reports, energised, public, opinion, which, brought, down, the, aberdeen, government, and, carried, lord, palmerston, into, office, as, prime, minister, leo, tolstoy, wrote, a, few, short, sketches, on, the, siege, of, sevastopol, collected, in, sevastopol, sketches, the, stories, detail, the, lives, of, the, russian, soldiers, and, citizens, in, sevastopol, during, the, siege, because, of, this, work, tolstoy, has, been, called, the, world, s, first, war, correspondent, historian, r, b, mccallum, points, out, the, war, was, enthusiastically, supported, by, the, british, populace, as, it, was, happening, but, the, mood, changed, very, dramatically, afterwards, pacifists, and, critics, were, unpopular, but, in, the, end, they, won, cobden, and, bright, were, true, to, their, principles, of, foreign, policy, which, laid, down, the, absolute, minimum, of, intervention, in, european, affairs, and, a, deep, moral, reprobation, of, war, when, the, first, enthusiasm, was, passed, when, the, dead, were, mourned, the, sufferings, revealed, and, the, cost, counted, when, in, 1870, russia, was, able, calmly, to, secure, the, revocation, of, the, treaty, which, disarmed, her, in, the, black, sea, the, view, became, general, of, the, war, was, stupid, and, unnecessary, and, effected, nothing, the, crimean, war, remained, as, a, classic, example, of, how, governments, may, plunge, into, war, how, strong, ambassadors, may, mislead, weak, prime, ministers, how, the, public, may, be, worked, up, into, a, facile, fury, and, how, the, achievements, of, the, war, may, crumble, to, nothing, the, bright, cobden, criticism, of, the, war, was, remembered, and, to, a, large, extent, accepted, isolation, from, european, entanglements, seemed, more, than, ever, desirable, as, the, memory, of, the, charge, of, the, light, brigade, demonstrates, the, war, became, an, iconic, symbol, of, logistical, medical, and, tactical, failures, and, mismanagement, public, opinion, in, britain, was, outraged, at, the, logistical, and, command, failures, of, the, war, the, newspapers, demanded, drastic, reforms, and, parliamentary, investigations, demonstrated, the, multiple, failures, of, the, army, the, reform, campaign, was, not, well, organised, and, the, traditional, aristocratic, leadership, of, the, army, pulled, itself, together, and, blocked, all, serious, reforms, no, one, was, punished, the, outbreak, of, the, indian, rebellion, of, 1857, shifted, attention, to, the, heroic, defence, of, british, interest, by, the, army, and, further, talk, of, reform, went, nowhere, the, demand, for, professionalisation, was, achieved, by, florence, nightingale, who, gained, worldwide, attention, for, pioneering, and, publicising, modern, nursing, while, treating, the, wounded, another, nurse, a, jamaican, named, mary, seacole, also, made, an, impact, providing, care, for, wounded, and, dying, soldiers, the, times, war, correspondent, william, howard, russell, spoke, highly, of, seacole, s, skill, as, a, healer, writing, a, more, tender, or, skilful, hand, about, a, wound, or, a, broken, limb, could, not, be, found, among, our, best, surgeons, outstanding, achievements, in, battlefield, surgery, were, done, during, the, war, of, 1853, 56, nikolai, pirogov, who, pioneered, the, system, of, field, surgery, that, other, nations, came, to, only, in, the, first, world, war, the, crimean, war, also, saw, the, first, tactical, use, of, railways, and, other, modern, inventions, such, as, the, electric, telegraph, with, the, first, live, war, reporting, by, russell, some, credit, russell, with, prompting, the, resignation, of, the, sitting, british, government, through, his, reporting, of, the, lacklustre, condition, of, british, forces, deployed, in, crimea, additionally, the, telegraph, reduced, the, independence, of, british, overseas, possessions, from, their, commanders, in, london, due, to, such, rapid, communications, newspaper, readership, informed, public, opinion, in, the, united, kingdom, and, france, as, never, before, the, crimean, war, was, a, contributing, factor, in, the, russian, abolition, of, serfdom, in, 1861, tsar, alexander, ii, nicholas, i, s, son, and, successor, saw, the, military, defeat, of, the, russian, serf, army, by, free, troops, from, britain, and, france, as, proof, of, the, need, for, emancipation, the, crimean, war, also, led, to, the, realisation, by, the, russian, government, of, its, technological, inferiority, in, military, practices, as, well, as, weapons, alexander, also, initiated, the, great, reforms, which, were, aimed, at, strengthening, and, modernising, the, russian, state, in, the, light, of, weaknesses, revealed, by, the, war
