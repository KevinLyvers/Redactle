the, great, game, was, a, rivalry, between, the, 19th, century, british, and, russian, empires, over, influence, in, central, asia, primarily, in, afghanistan, persia, and, tibet, the, two, colonial, empires, used, military, interventions, and, diplomatic, negotiations, to, acquire, and, redefine, territories, in, central, and, south, asia, russia, conquered, turkestan, and, britain, expanded, and, set, the, borders, of, british, colonial, india, by, the, early, 20th, century, a, line, of, independent, states, tribes, and, monarchies, from, the, shore, of, the, caspian, sea, to, the, eastern, himalayas, were, made, into, protectorates, and, territories, of, the, two, empires, though, the, great, game, was, marked, by, distrust, diplomatic, intrigue, and, regional, wars, it, never, erupted, into, a, full, scale, war, directly, between, russian, and, british, colonial, forces, however, the, two, nations, battled, in, the, crimean, war, from, 1853, to, 1856, which, affected, the, great, game, the, russian, and, british, empires, also, cooperated, numerous, times, during, the, great, game, including, many, treaties, and, the, afghan, boundary, commission, britain, feared, russia, s, southward, expansion, would, threaten, india, while, russia, feared, the, expansion, of, british, interests, into, central, asia, as, a, result, britain, made, it, a, high, priority, to, protect, all, approaches, to, india, while, russia, continued, its, military, conquest, of, central, asia, aware, of, the, importance, of, india, to, the, british, russian, efforts, in, the, region, often, had, the, aim, of, extorting, concessions, from, them, in, europe, but, after, 1801, they, had, no, serious, intention, of, directly, attacking, india, russian, war, plans, for, india, that, were, proposed, but, never, materialised, included, the, duhamel, and, khrulev, plans, of, the, crimean, war, 1853, 1856, russia, and, britain, s, 19th, century, rivalry, in, asia, began, with, the, planned, indian, march, of, paul, and, russian, invasions, of, iran, in, 1804, 1813, and, 1826, 1828, shuffling, persia, into, a, competition, between, colonial, powers, according, to, one, major, view, the, great, game, started, on, 12, january, 1830, when, lord, ellenborough, the, president, of, the, board, of, control, for, india, tasked, lord, bentinck, the, governor, general, with, establishing, a, trade, route, to, the, emirate, of, bukhara, britain, aimed, to, create, a, protectorate, in, afghanistan, and, support, the, ottoman, empire, persia, khiva, and, bukhara, as, buffer, states, against, russian, expansion, this, would, protect, india, and, key, british, sea, trade, routes, by, blocking, russia, from, gaining, a, port, on, the, persian, gulf, or, the, indian, ocean, as, russian, and, british, spheres, of, influence, expanded, and, competed, russia, proposed, afghanistan, as, the, neutral, zone, traditionally, the, great, game, came, to, a, close, between, 1895, and, 1907, in, september, 1895, london, and, saint, petersburg, signed, the, pamir, boundary, commission, protocols, when, the, border, between, afghanistan, and, the, russian, empire, was, defined, using, diplomatic, methods, in, august, 1907, the, anglo, russian, convention, created, an, alliance, between, britain, and, russia, and, formally, delineated, control, in, afghanistan, persia, and, tibet, the, term, great, game, was, coined, in, 1840, by, a, british, intelligence, officer, captain, arthur, conolly, 1807, 1842, rudyard, kipling, s, 1901, novel, kim, popularized, the, term, increasing, its, association, with, great, power, rivalry, it, became, even, more, popular, after, the, 1979, advent, of, the, soviet, afghan, war, the, phrase, the, great, game, was, used, well, before, the, 19th, century, and, was, associated, with, games, of, risk, such, as, cards, and, dice, the, french, equivalent, le, grand, jeu, dates, back, to, at, least, 1585, and, is, associated, with, meanings, of, risk, chance, and, deception, in, the, historical, sense, the, term, dates, from, the, mid, 19th, century, captain, conolly, had, been, appointed, as, a, political, officer, a, similar, term, the, tournament, of, shadows, was, reportedly, used, by, russian, diplomat, karl, nesselrode, in, july, 1840, in, correspondence, to, major, henry, rawlinson, who, had, been, recently, appointed, as, the, new, political, agent, in, kandahar, conolly, wrote, you, ve, a, great, game, a, noble, game, before, you, conolly, believed, that, rawlinson, s, new, post, gave, him, the, opportunity, to, advance, humanitarianism, in, afghanistan, and, summed, up, his, hopes, if, the, british, government, would, only, play, the, grand, game, help, russia, cordially, to, all, that, she, has, a, right, to, expect, shake, hands, with, persia, get, her, all, possible, amends, from, oosbegs, force, the, bukhara, amir, to, be, just, to, us, the, afghans, and, other, oosbeg, states, and, his, own, kingdom, but, why, go, on, you, know, my, at, any, rate, in, one, sense, enlarged, views, the, expediency, nay, the, necessity, of, them, will, be, seen, and, we, shall, play, the, noble, part, that, the, first, christian, nation, of, the, world, ought, to, fill, it, was, introduced, into, the, mainstream, by, the, british, novelist, rudyard, kipling, in, his, novel, kim, 1901, it, was, first, used, academically, by, professor, h, w, c, davis, in, a, presentation, titled, the, great, game, in, asia, 1800, 1844, on, 10, november, 1926, the, use, of, the, term, the, great, game, to, describe, anglo, russian, rivalry, in, central, asia, became, common, only, after, the, second, world, war, at, the, start, of, the, 19th, century, the, indian, subcontinent, was, ruled, in, part, by, independent, princely, states, and, in, part, by, the, company, rule, of, the, british, east, india, company, during, the, 19th, century, a, political, and, diplomatic, confrontation, developed, between, britain, and, russia, over, afghanistan, which, would, become, known, as, the, great, game, russia, s, foreign, policy, was, driven, by, the, perspective, that, britain, would, develop, and, control, commercial, and, military, inroads, into, central, asia, and, britain, s, foreign, policy, was, based, on, expectations, of, russia, adding, the, jewel, in, the, crown, india, to, the, vast, empire, that, russia, was, building, in, asia, this, resulted, in, an, atmosphere, of, distrust, and, the, constant, threat, of, war, between, the, two, empires, if, russia, were, to, gain, control, of, the, emirate, of, afghanistan, it, might, then, be, used, as, a, staging, post, for, a, russian, invasion, of, india, was, the, british, line, of, thinking, napoleon, had, proposed, a, joint, franco, russian, invasion, of, india, to, tsar, paul, i, of, russia, expecting, a, future, action, by, the, british, against, russia, and, her, allies, in, europe, paul, decided, in, 1801, to, make, the, first, move, towards, where, he, believed, the, british, empire, was, weakest, indian, march, of, paul, he, wrote, to, the, ataman, of, the, don, cossacks, troops, cavalry, general, vasily, petrovich, orlov, directing, him, to, march, to, orenburg, conquer, the, central, asian, khanates, and, from, there, invade, india, paul, was, assassinated, in, the, same, year, and, the, invasion, was, terminated, historian, peter, hopkirk, wrote, that, tsar, paul, had, not, been, able, to, obtain, a, detailed, map, of, india, until, the, cossacks, departure, from, orenburg, he, quotes, the, tsar, as, instructing, orlov, my, maps, only, go, as, far, as, khiva, and, the, river, oxus, beyond, these, points, it, is, your, affair, to, gain, information, about, the, possessions, of, the, english, and, the, condition, of, the, native, population, subject, to, their, rule, the, british, public, learned, about, the, incident, years, later, but, it, firmly, imprinted, on, the, popular, consciousness, contributing, to, feelings, of, mutual, suspicion, and, distrust, associated, with, the, great, game, hugh, seton, watson, observed, that, the, grotesque, plan, had, no, military, significance, but, at, least, showed, its, author, s, state, of, mind, hopkirk, remarked, that, no, serious, thought, or, study, has, been, given, to, this, wild, adventure, napoleon, tried, to, persuade, paul, s, son, tsar, alexander, i, of, russia, to, invade, india, however, alexander, resisted, in, 1807, napoleon, dispatched, general, claude, matthieu, count, gardane, on, a, french, military, mission, to, persia, with, the, intention, of, persuading, russia, to, invade, india, in, response, britain, sent, its, own, diplomatic, missions, in, 1808, with, military, advisers, to, persia, and, afghanistan, under, the, capable, mountstuart, elphinstone, averting, the, possible, french, and, russian, threat, to, india, however, britain, was, left, with, concerns, about, being, able, to, defend, its, colony, on, the, subcontinent, at, the, time, russia, also, went, to, war, with, qajar, iran, and, invaded, the, persian, caucasus, from, 1804, 1813, adding, to, britain, s, fears, while, russia, was, distracted, mainly, by, the, napoleonic, wars, in, 1810, british, lieutenant, henry, pottinger, and, captain, charles, christie, undertook, an, expedition, from, nushki, balochistan, to, isfahan, central, persia, disguised, as, muslims, the, expedition, was, funded, by, the, east, india, company, and, was, to, map, and, research, the, regions, of, beloochistan, balochistan, and, persia, because, of, concerns, about, india, being, invaded, by, french, forces, from, that, direction, after, the, disastrous, french, invasion, of, russia, in, 1812, and, the, collapse, of, the, french, army, the, threat, of, a, french, invasion, through, persia, was, removed, the, shah, of, iran, fath, ali, shah, qajar, would, become, part, of, diplomatic, intrigues, about, india, he, first, received, limited, british, support, in, 1801, that, was, canceled, after, russia, s, invasion, of, persia, in, 1804, fath, ali, then, lent, a, promise, to, napoleon, in, 1807, to, theoretically, invade, british, india, in, exchange, for, french, military, assistance, gardane, s, mission, which, fell, through, despite, the, treaty, of, finckenstein, when, france, allied, with, russia, at, tilsit, in, 1807, as, russia, was, still, invading, iran, fath, ali, shah, turned, toward, british, diplomacy, and, alliance, in, 1809, the, shah, was, also, able, to, use, a, rivalry, between, the, east, india, company, and, the, british, foreign, office, to, garner, more, british, aid, in, the, 1809, preliminary, treaty, of, tehran, persia, agreed, to, stop, any, european, or, foreign, army, passing, to, india, while, the, british, agreed, to, send, a, mission, to, train, sixteen, thousand, persian, soldiers, and, if, qajar, persia, was, invaded, by, a, european, state, pay, a, 100, 000, subsidy, to, persia, while, attempting, to, mediate, if, at, peace, with, persia, s, enemy, 167, nevertheless, russia, would, end, up, defeating, iran, a, few, years, later, with, britain, mediating, the, treaty, the, russo, persian, wars, began, to, coalesce, into, a, point, of, tension, between, the, british, and, russian, empires, particularly, following, the, treaty, of, gulistan, in, 1813, which, gave, the, russian, empire, the, theoretical, right, to, intervene, in, persia, at, any, time, a, humiliation, of, persia, fath, ali, shah, sought, to, counterbalance, russia, by, increasing, the, ties, between, the, qajars, and, britain, the, british, offered, military, and, financial, assistance, to, the, shah, supporting, iran, as, a, buffer, between, russia, and, india, the, russian, invasion, of, iran, in, 1826, 1828, led, to, a, russian, victory, weakening, qajar, iran, which, retained, only, minimal, influence, and, power, this, fully, placed, persia, into, another, colonial, contest, between, russia, and, britain, the, great, game, is, said, to, have, begun, on, 12, january, 1830, when, lord, ellenborough, the, president, of, the, board, of, control, for, india, tasked, lord, william, bentinck, the, governor, general, of, india, to, establish, a, new, trade, route, to, bukhara, following, the, treaty, of, turkmenchay, 1828, and, the, treaty, of, adrianople, 1829, britain, expected, that, persia, and, the, ottoman, empire, turkey, would, be, forced, to, become, protectorates, of, russia, this, would, change, britain, s, perception, of, the, world, and, its, response, was, the, great, game, britain, had, no, intention, of, getting, involved, in, the, middle, east, but, it, did, envision, a, series, of, buffer, states, between, the, british, and, russian, empires, that, included, turkey, persia, plus, the, khanate, of, khiva, and, the, khanate, of, bukhara, that, would, grow, from, future, trade, behind, these, buffer, states, would, be, their, protected, states, stretching, from, the, persian, gulf, to, india, and, up, into, the, emirate, of, afghanistan, with, british, sea, power, protecting, trade, sea, lanes, access, to, afghanistan, was, to, be, through, developing, trade, routes, along, the, indus, and, sutlej, rivers, using, steam, powered, boats, and, therefore, access, through, the, sind, and, punjab, regions, would, be, required, persia, would, have, to, give, up, its, claim, on, herat, in, afghanistan, afghanistan, would, need, to, be, transformed, from, a, group, of, warring, principalities, into, one, state, ruled, by, an, ally, whose, foreign, relations, would, be, conducted, on, his, behalf, by, the, governor, general, and, the, foreign, office, the, great, game, meant, closer, ties, between, britain, and, the, states, along, her, northwest, frontier, britain, believed, that, it, was, the, world, s, first, free, society, and, the, most, industrially, advanced, country, and, therefore, that, it, had, a, duty, to, use, its, iron, steam, power, and, cotton, goods, to, take, over, central, asia, and, develop, it, british, goods, were, to, be, followed, by, british, values, and, the, respect, for, private, property, with, pay, for, work, and, security, in, place, nomads, would, settle, and, become, tribal, herdsman, surrounding, oasis, cities, these, were, to, develop, into, modern, states, with, agreed, borders, as, in, the, european, model, therefore, lines, needed, to, be, agreed, and, drawn, on, maps, morgan, says, that, two, proud, and, expanding, empires, approached, each, other, without, any, agreed, frontier, from, opposite, directions, over, a, backward, uncivilized, and, undeveloped, region, here, we, are, just, as, we, were, snarling, at, each, other, hating, each, other, but, neither, wishing, for, war, lord, palmerston, 1835, american, historian, david, fromkin, argues, that, by, the, mid, 19th, century, the, british, had, developed, at, least, nine, reasons, to, expect, a, major, war, with, russia, unless, russian, expansion, in, asia, could, be, stopped, in, the, early, 1880s, russia, failed, to, float, a, nine, 9, million, loan, on, the, european, markets, for, its, strategic, geopolitical, enterprises, driving, severe, budget, cuts, by, the, minister, of, finance, for, the, construction, of, the, russo, indian, railway, however, an, operation, supervised, by, renowned, engineer, general, mikhail, annenkov, funding, had, been, freely, furnished, the, tsar, also, entered, into, agreements, about, delivery, of, munition, for, its, fortresses, at, an, estimated, value, of, one, million, sterling, with, german, steel, magnate, alfred, krupp, being, the, arms, manufacturer, for, the, german, empire, in, 1557, bokhara, and, khiva, sent, ambassadors, to, ivan, iv, seeking, permission, to, trade, in, russia, russia, had, an, interest, in, establishing, a, trade, route, from, moscow, to, india, from, then, until, the, mid, 19th, century, russian, ambassadors, to, the, region, spent, much, of, their, time, trying, to, free, russians, who, had, been, taken, as, slaves, by, the, khanates, russia, would, later, expand, across, siberia, to, the, far, east, where, it, reached, the, pacific, port, that, would, become, known, as, vladivostok, by, 1859, this, eastward, expansion, was, of, no, concern, to, the, british, foreign, office, because, this, area, did, not, lie, across, any, british, trade, routes, or, destinations, and, therefore, was, of, no, interest, to, britain, beginning, in, the, 1820s, russian, troops, would, begin, to, advance, southward, from, siberia, in, search, of, secure, boundaries, and, reliable, neighbors, this, advance, would, not, cease, until, russia, s, frontiers, and, her, sphere, of, influence, were, firm, in, the, central, asia, and, this, would, include, bokhara, and, khiva, between, 1824, and, 1854, russia, occupied, the, entire, kazakh, khanate, modern, day, kazakhstan, this, raised, russo, khivan, tensions, in, addition, to, khiva, s, legal, discrimination, of, russian, merchants, who, were, just, beginning, to, penetrate, central, asia, and, the, ongoing, issue, of, russian, slaves, russia, launched, an, attack, in, 1839, 1840, but, it, failed, to, reach, khiva, because, of, the, tough, terrain, and, weather, however, the, khan, of, khiva, feared, a, further, russian, assault, and, released, a, number, of, russian, slaves, during, the, 1840s, and, 1850s, russia, s, aims, in, central, asia, were, for, bukhara, and, khiva, to, refrain, from, hostile, actions, against, russia, cease, possession, of, russian, slaves, and, the, granting, of, asylum, to, kazakhs, fleeing, from, russian, justice, khiva, must, cease, her, attacks, on, caravans, along, the, syr, darya, russian, merchants, must, be, allowed, to, trade, on, the, same, terms, as, native, merchants, in, bukhara, and, khiva, the, khanates, must, guarantee, the, safety, of, the, persons, and, property, of, russian, merchants, levy, no, excessive, duties, permit, unhampered, transit, of, goods, and, caravans, across, central, asia, into, neighboring, states, and, allow, russian, commercial, agents, to, reside, in, bukhara, and, khiva, and, free, navigation, on, the, amu, darya, river, for, russian, ships, none, of, these, aims, was, realised, russia, s, borders, remained, insecure, and, in, addition, there, was, growing, british, influence, in, the, region, in, 1869, when, british, diplomat, clarendon, proposed, the, amu, darya, river, as, the, basis, for, a, neutral, zone, between, british, and, russian, spheres, of, influence, alexander, gorchakov, proposed, afghanistan, as, the, neutral, zone, russia, feared, the, influence, that, a, muslim, power, with, british, support, might, have, on, the, other, khanates, in, the, region, the, russian, empire, sought, to, expand, its, access, to, strategic, coastlines, such, as, the, black, sea, persian, gulf, and, the, pacific, russian, war, plans, against, british, india, were, developed, during, the, crimean, war, presented, to, the, tsar, in, 1854, and, 1855, these, were, the, duhamel, plan, and, khrulev, plan, according, to, historian, evgeny, sergeev, the, great, game, represented, a, great, power, competition, that, did, not, initiate, only, with, russia, s, defeat, in, the, crimean, war, in, 1856, but, was, already, well, underway, and, was, only, intensified, thereafter, expansion, into, central, asia, was, closely, connected, with, ambitions, in, india, historian, alexandre, andreyev, argued, that, the, rapid, advance, of, the, russian, empire, in, central, asia, while, mainly, serving, to, extend, the, southern, frontier, was, aimed, to, keep, british, eyes, off, of, the, january, uprising, in, poland, andreyev, states, that, as, late, as, 1909, strategists, of, the, russian, empire, sought, to, use, afghanistan, to, threaten, india, to, exert, influence, on, britain, quoting, andrei, snesarev, according, to, diplomatic, historian, barbara, jelavich, it, was, logistically, not, possible, for, the, russian, empire, to, invade, india, and, was, not, seriously, considered, however, the, tsars, understood, that, making, invasion, plans, threatening, the, jewel, of, britain, s, empire, was, a, way, to, extract, more, favorable, outcomes, in, europe, similarly, to, the, british, empire, the, russian, empire, saw, themselves, as, a, civilizing, power, expanding, a, purely, humanitarian, mission, among, the, turcomans, into, what, they, perceived, a, semi, barbarous, region, reflecting, the, ideology, of, the, time, in, 1782, george, forster, a, civil, servant, of, the, east, india, company, undertook, a, journey, that, began, in, calcutta, bengal, and, passed, through, kashmir, afghanistan, herat, khorassan, mazanderan, crossed, the, caspian, sea, by, ship, and, then, travelled, to, baku, astrakhan, moscow, st, petersburg, and, then, by, ship, to, london, forster, s, detailed, description, of, the, journey, was, published, in, 1798, william, moorcroft, was, an, explorer, doctor, veterinary, surgeon, and, superintendent, of, the, east, india, company, s, horse, stud, he, had, an, interest, in, expanding, trade, in, central, asia, where, he, thought, the, russian, traders, were, already, active, in, 1820, moorcroft, george, trebeck, and, george, guthrie, left, india, for, bukhara, to, buy, turkoman, horses, and, reached, bukhara, in, 1825, however, all, three, died, of, fever, on, the, return, journey, his, travels, were, published, in, 1841, charles, masson, formerly, of, the, east, india, company, resided, in, baluchistan, afghanistan, and, the, punjab, between, 1826, and, 1838, and, published, his, travels, in, september, 1829, lieutenant, arthur, conolly, of, the, east, india, company, travelled, from, st, petersburg, russia, to, the, caspian, desert, to, kir, northern, iran, was, detained, in, astrabad, northern, iran, as, a, russian, spy, then, travelled, with, a, caravan, of, pilgrims, to, meshed, marched, with, the, afghan, army, from, there, to, herat, then, traveled, to, kandahar, to, quetta, then, across, the, indian, desert, to, the, british, frontier, in, january, 1831, he, published, his, travels, in, 1834, however, after, 1830, britain, s, commercial, and, diplomatic, interest, to, the, north, west, would, eventually, become, formidable, in, 1831, captain, alexander, burnes, and, colonel, henry, pottinger, s, surveys, of, the, indus, river, would, prepare, the, way, for, a, future, assault, on, the, sind, to, clear, a, path, towards, central, asia, burnes, embarked, on, a, dangerous, 12, month, journey, beginning, in, 1831, into, afghanistan, and, through, the, hindu, kush, to, bukhara, returning, in, 1832, burnes, a, christian, travelling, through, a, muslim, country, was, one, of, the, first, to, study, afghanistan, for, british, intelligence, and, upon, his, return, he, published, his, book, travels, to, bukhara, which, became, an, overnight, success, in, 1834, between, 1832, and, 1834, britain, attempted, to, negotiate, trade, agreements, with, ranjit, singh, ruler, of, the, sikh, empire, and, the, amirs, of, sindh, however, these, attempts, were, unsuccessful, in, 1835, lord, auckland, was, appointed, governor, general, and, replaced, bentinck, who, had, pursued, a, non, intervention, policy, the, india, board, instructed, auckland, to, watch, more, closely, than, has, hitherto, been, attempted, the, progress, of, events, in, afghanistan, and, to, counteract, the, progress, of, russian, influence, the, mode, of, dealing, with, this, very, important, question, whether, by, dispatching, a, confidential, agent, to, dost, mohammed, of, kabul, merely, to, watch, the, progress, of, events, or, to, enter, into, relations, with, this, chief, either, of, a, political, or, merely, in, the, first, instance, of, a, commercial, character, we, confide, in, your, discretion, as, well, as, the, adoption, of, any, other, measures, that, may, appear, to, you, desirable, to, counteract, russian, influence, in, that, quarter, should, you, be, satisfied, that, the, time, has, arrived, at, which, it, would, be, right, for, you, to, interfere, decidedly, in, the, affairs, of, afghanistan, such, an, interference, would, doubtless, be, requisite, either, to, prevent, the, extension, of, persian, dominion, in, that, quarter, or, to, raise, a, timely, barrier, against, the, impending, encroachments, of, russian, influence, in, that, year, lieutenant, john, wood, of, the, indian, navy, commanded, the, first, steamboat, to, paddle, up, the, indus, river, and, surveyed, the, river, as, he, went, in, 1838, he, led, an, expedition, that, found, one, of, the, river, oxus, sources, in, central, asia, he, published, his, travels, in, 1872, in, 1837, the, russian, envoy, captain, jan,

geographical, society, in, 1869, made, the, arrival, of, british, pundits, at, lhasa, known, in, russia, the, russian, explorer, nikolay, przhevalsky, felt, there, was, a, british, threat, to, russian, ambitions, in, inner, asia, and, set, out, on, a, series, of, 1870s, expeditions, although, he, failed, to, reach, tibet, s, capital, at, lhasa, he, travelled, extensively, in, tibet, qinghai, and, xinjiang, przhevalsky, s, expeditions, became, famous, and, increased, interest, in, european, expansion, into, asia, among, the, russian, press, aristocracy, and, academia, in, the, 1880s, przhevalsky, advocated, for, the, forcible, annexation, of, western, china, mongolia, and, tibet, and, their, colonization, by, cossacks, although, the, plan, received, some, pushback, from, tsar, alexander, iii, who, favoured, influence, rather, than, an, invasion, historian, alexandre, andreev, argues, that, tibet, was, a, major, territorial, focus, of, the, russian, empire, and, soviet, union, and, was, connected, to, the, great, game, andreyev, mentions, that, in, 1893, tsar, alexander, iii, financed, an, adventurist, project, by, a, tibetan, medicine, practitioner, piotr, aleksandrovich, badmaev, which, aimed, to, annex, mongolia, tibet, and, china, to, the, russian, empire, although, not, very, successful, various, agents, were, sent, out, to, conduct, espionage, in, tibet, in, regards, to, british, influence, investigate, trade, and, attempted, to, foment, rebellion, in, mongolia, against, the, qing, dynasty, in, the, late, 19th, century, britain, strategically, supported, the, qing, dynasty, s, protectorates, against, the, russian, empire, according, to, andreyev, in, the, days, of, the, great, game, mongolia, was, an, object, of, imperialist, encroachment, by, russia, as, tibet, was, for, the, british, pg, 96, britain, feared, increased, russian, influence, in, tibet, due, to, contacts, between, the, russia, born, buryat, agvan, dorzhiev, and, the, 13th, dalai, lama, agvan, dorzhiev, claimed, that, russia, was, a, powerful, buddhist, country, that, would, ally, with, tibet, against, china, or, britain, in, response, britain, sought, to, increase, its, own, influence, in, tibet, as, a, buffer, for, british, india, british, forces, led, by, sir, francis, younghusband, invaded, the, country, with, the, curzon, expedition, in, 1904, and, made, a, treaty, with, the, tibetans, the, 1904, lhasa, convention, according, to, robert, irwin, who, considers, a, smaller, espionage, focused, interpretation, of, the, great, game, tibet, was, indeed, connected, to, the, great, game, but, the, truth, is, that, in, the, period, concerned, british, ruling, circles, didn, t, own, so, much, as, a, sweetshop, in, tibet, specifically, he, notes, that, the, commercial, trade, that, followed, the, younghusband, expedition, was, negligible, compared, to, the, cost, of, the, expedition, pradip, phanjoubam, states, that, the, anglo, russian, rivalry, in, tibet, ultimately, had, implications, for, northeast, india, as, well, culminating, in, the, simla, convention, phanjoubam, argues, that, britain, overreacted, to, russian, interest, in, tibet, if, perhaps, understandably, due, to, the, presence, of, dorzhiev, a, constantly, shifting, british, policy, on, china, from, pro, to, anti, qing, protectorates, by, britain, as, well, as, the, shift, from, opposition, to, russia, to, the, 1907, convention, led, the, qing, dynasty, to, decide, on, a, forward, policy, in, the, himalayas, if, it, were, not, for, the, xinhai, revolution, india, would, have, been, more, threatened, than, it, was, nonetheless, on, the, chessboard, of, the, great, game, in, far, off, places, as, mongolia, afghanistan, and, persia, was, thus, determined, the, fate, of, british, tibet, policy, and, therefore, the, shadow, of, the, great, game, too, came, to, fall, on, the, future, of, india, s, northeast, in, its, meiji, period, the, empire, of, japan, would, observe, the, great, game, and, participate, indirectly, through, diplomacy, and, espionage, for, example, japan, hosted, abdurreshid, ibrahim, a, pan, muslim, opponent, of, russian, and, british, expansion, japanese, interest, in, the, region, as, well, as, enmity, with, russia, led, to, the, anglo, japanese, alliance, and, an, attempted, ottoman, japanese, alliance, nishi, tokujir, made, some, of, japan, s, first, official, diplomatic, interactions, in, central, asia, and, observed, russian, colonial, policy, during, the, early, meiji, period, while, during, the, end, of, the, period, colonel, fukushima, yasumasa, managed, japan, s, central, asia, policy, during, its, contest, with, russia, later, the, russo, japanese, war, also, changed, and, weakened, russian, designs, in, xinjiang, according, to, researcher, jin, noda, japanese, intelligence, activities, occurred, against, a, backdrop, of, acute, russian, and, british, interest, in, the, geopolitical, fate, of, xinjiang, tibet, and, russian, turkestan, carl, gustaf, emil, mannerheim, also, acted, as, a, tsarist, agent, during, the, great, game, leading, an, expedition, through, tibet, xinjiang, and, gansu, on, the, way, to, beijing, the, russian, general, staff, wanted, on, the, ground, intelligence, about, reforms, and, activities, by, the, qing, dynasty, as, well, as, the, military, feasibility, of, invading, western, china, a, possible, move, in, their, struggle, with, britain, for, control, of, inner, asia, in, a, report, to, the, russian, general, staff, mannerheim, also, argued, in, favor, of, a, russian, invasion, of, xinjiang, disguised, as, an, ethnographic, collector, mannerheim, joined, the, french, archeologist, paul, pelliot, s, expedition, at, samarkand, in, modern, uzbekistan, they, started, from, the, terminus, of, the, trans, caspian, railway, in, andijan, in, july, 1906, but, mannerheim, quarreled, with, pelliot, so, he, made, the, greater, part, of, the, expedition, on, his, own, mannerheim, met, the, 13th, dalai, lama, of, tibet, and, acted, as, an, envoy, of, russia, various, authors, connect, british, russian, competition, in, iran, to, the, great, game, as, well, this, competition, continued, until, the, anglo, russian, entente, in, 1907, after, which, the, british, and, russian, empires, largely, moved, together, in, their, overtures, for, imperial, influence, in, the, region, until, the, bolshevik, revolution, the, great, game, in, iran, took, the, form, of, military, conquests, diplomatic, intrigues, and, the, competition, of, trade, goods, 20, 74, russian, colonists, arrived, in, northern, iran, settling, the, region, around, astarabad, 73, 74, although, britain, had, a, reputation, for, industrialization, and, international, trade, boosted, by, its, colony, of, india, russian, authors, saw, the, russian, empire, as, competing, directly, with, britain, for, trade, in, iran, and, other, bordering, markets, russian, travelogues, written, between, the, 1870s, and, the, turn, of, the, 1900s, seem, to, imply, that, russian, commerce, had, become, dominant, in, the, northern, and, western, portions, of, iran, that, would, be, officially, delineated, to, russia, by, britain, in, 1907, 74, 76, russia, had, also, acquired, concessions, such, as, a, monopoly, on, the, lucrative, caviar, in, the, southern, caspian, sea, which, lasted, until, after, the, first, world, war, 20, after, the, 1828, treaty, of, turkmanchay, russia, received, territorial, domination, in, iran, with, the, romanovs, shifting, to, a, policy, of, informal, support, for, the, weakened, qajar, dynasty, continuing, to, place, pressure, with, advances, in, the, largely, nomadic, turkestan, a, crucial, frontier, territory, of, the, qajars, this, russian, domination, of, persia, continued, for, nearly, a, century, the, persian, monarchy, became, more, of, a, symbolic, concept, in, which, russian, diplomats, were, themselves, powerbrokers, in, iran, and, the, monarchy, was, dependent, on, british, and, russian, loans, for, funds, in, 1879, the, establishment, of, the, cossack, brigade, by, russian, officers, gave, the, russian, empire, influence, over, the, modernization, of, the, qajar, army, this, influence, was, especially, pronounced, because, the, persian, monarchy, s, legitimacy, was, predicated, on, an, image, of, military, prowess, first, turkic, and, then, european, influenced, by, the, 1890s, russian, tutors, doctors, and, officers, were, prominent, at, the, shah, s, court, influencing, policy, personally, russia, and, britain, had, competing, investments, in, the, industrialisation, of, iran, including, roads, and, telegraph, lines, as, a, way, to, profit, and, extend, their, influence, however, until, 1907, the, great, game, rivalry, was, so, pronounced, that, mutual, british, and, russian, demands, to, the, shah, to, exclude, the, other, blocked, all, railroad, construction, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, 20, in, 1907, the, british, and, russian, empires, came, to, a, mutual, agreement, which, provided, a, zone, of, influence, in, southeastern, iran, to, britain, and, northern, iran, to, russia, tsar, nicholas, ii, would, be, a, staunch, supporter, of, the, mohammad, ali, shah, qajar, against, the, revolutionaries, in, a, large, scale, intervention, that, involved, both, regular, russian, troops, and, the, persian, cossacks, failing, to, fully, suppress, the, persian, constitutional, revolution, or, keep, muhammad, ali, shah, in, power, the, constitutional, reforms, were, put, in, place, against, russia, s, wishes, though, the, cossack, brigade, remained, a, major, factor, an, iranian, former, cossack, reza, shah, would, establish, the, pahlavi, dynasty, in, 1878, russia, sent, troops, on, an, uninvited, diplomatic, mission, to, kabul, sher, ali, khan, the, amir, of, afghanistan, tried, unsuccessfully, to, keep, them, from, entering, afghanistan, the, russians, arrived, in, kabul, on, 22, july, 1878, as, a, reaction, on, 14, august, the, british, demanded, that, sher, ali, also, accept, a, british, mission, the, amir, not, only, refused, to, receive, a, british, mission, under, neville, bowles, chamberlain, but, also, threatened, to, stop, it, if, it, attempted, to, enter, his, country, lord, lytton, the, viceroy, of, british, india, ordered, an, envoy, to, set, out, on, a, diplomatic, mission, for, kabul, in, september, 1878, the, mission, was, turned, back, as, it, approached, the, eastern, entrance, of, the, khyber, pass, triggering, the,

negotiations, in, 1879, in, 1880, however, the, fighting, was, reignited, after, a, british, envoy, on, a, mission, to, kabul, was, massacred, on, 21, january, 1873, great, britain, and, russia, signed, an, agreement, that, stipulated, that, the, eastern, badakhshan, area, as, well, as, the, wakhan, corridor, to, lake, sariqol, were, afghan, territory, the, northern, afghan, boundary, was, the, amu, darya, oxus, river, as, far, west, as, khwaja, salar, near, khamyab, and, a, joint, russian, british, commission, would, define, the, boundary, from, the, amu, darya, to, the, persian, border, on, the, hari, harirud, river, however, no, boundary, west, of, the, amu, darya, was, defined, until, 1885, the, agreement, was, regarded, as, having, defined, the, british, and, russian, spheres, of, influence, in, afghanistan, and, central, asia, gave, the, two, sides, the, legitimacy, to, advance, within, their, designated, zones, created, cordial, relations, between, the, two, rival, european, powers, and, raised, the, new, problem, of, defining, what, were, the, frontiers, of, afghanistan, russia, and, china, in, the, upper, oxus, region, in, the, pamir, mountains, the, agreement, was, negotiated, by, russian, diplomat, prince, alexander, gorchakov, the, lands, of, badakhshan, and, wakhan, were, accepted, by, russia, as, part, of, afghanistan, russia, accepted, all, of, britain, s, proposals, on, afghanistan, s, northern, borders, and, expected, that, britain, would, keep, afghanistan, from, committing, any, aggression, however, this, set, in, motion, russia, s, annexation, of, the, khanate, of, khiva, in, the, same, year, badakhshan, would, later, be, divided, between, afghanistan, and, russian, controlled, bukhara, by, the, pamir, boundary, commission, in, 1895, after, the, british, siege, of, kabul, warfare, was, settled, diplomatically, by, the, treaty, of, gandamak, of, 1879, the, british, sent, an, envoy, and, mission, to, kabul, but, on, 3, september, this, mission, was, massacred, and, the, conflict, was, reignited, the, second, phase, ended, in, september, 1880, when, the, british, defeated, ayub, khan, outside, kandahar, a, new, emir, abdul, rahman, khan, who, was, known, to, be, a, russian, ally, and, an, opponent, of, the, british, ratified, and, confirmed, the, gandamak, treaty, once, more, when, the, british, and, indian,

russian, empire, the, british, were, aware, that, amir, abdur, rahman, khan, had, the, support, of, the, afghans, to, continue, fighting, and, he, did, not, allow, a, british, resident, to, stay, in, kabul, which, was, a, british, objective, that, caused, the, start, of, the, conflict, in, return, he, accepted, british, control, of, afghanistan, s, foreign, policies, while, maintaining, internal, sovereignty, and, to, cede, to, the, british, a, number, of, its, southern, frontier, areas, including, the, districts, of, pishin, sibi, harnai, and, thal, chotiali, in, 1881, russian, forces, however, took, geok, tepe, and, in, 1884, they, occupied, merv, as, the, russian, forces, were, close, to, herat, the, british, and, russian, governments, formed, a, joint, anglo, russian, diplomatic, afghan, boundary, commission, in, the, same, year, to, define, the, borders, between, the, russian, empire, and, northern, afghanistan, in, 1885, a, russian, force, annexed, the, panjdeh, district, north, of, herat, province, and, its, fort, in, what, has, been, called, the, panjdeh, incident, the, afghans, claimed, that, the, people, of, the, district, had, always, paid, tribute, to, afghanistan, and, the, russians, argued, that, this, district, was, part, of, the, khanates, of, khiva, and, merv, which, they, had, annexed, earlier, the, afghan, boundary, commission, was, supposed, to, have, settled, the, dispute, however, the, battle, occurred, before, its, arrival, the, afghan, force, of, 500, was, overwhelmed, by, superior, russian, numbers, britain, did, not, aid, afghanistan, as, was, required, by, the, treaty, of, gandamak, leading, the, amir, to, conclude, that, he, could, not, rely, on, the, british, in, the, face, of, russian, aggression, german, chancellor, otto, von, bismarck, saw, how, important, the, great, game, had, become, for, russia, and, britain, germany, had, no, direct, stakes, however, its, dominance, of, europe, was, enhanced, when, russian, troops, were, based, as, far, away, from, germany, as, possible, over, two, decades, 1871, 1890, he, maneuvered, to, help, the, british, hoping, to, force, the, russians, to, commit, more, soldiers, to, asia, however, bismarck, through, the, three, emperors, league, also, aided, russia, by, pressuring, the, ottoman, empire, to, block, the, bosporus, from, british, naval, access, compelling, an, anglo, russian, negotiation, regarding, afghanistan, on, 10, september, 1885, the, delimitation, protocol, between, great, britain, and, russia, was, signed, in, london, the, protocol, defined, the, boundary, from, the, oxus, to, the, harirud, and, was, later, followed, by, 19, additional, protocols, providing, further, detail, between, 1885, and, 1888, the, afghan, boundary, commission, agreed, that, russia, would, relinquish, the, farthest, territory, captured, in, their, advance, but, retain, panjdeh, the, agreement, delineated, a, permanent, northern, afghan, frontier, at, the, amu, darya, with, the, loss, of, a, large, amount, of, territory, especially, around, panjdeh, this, left, the, border, east, of, lake, zorkul, in, the, wakhan, region, to, be, defined, this, territory, was, claimed, by, china, russia, and, afghanistan, in, the, 1880s, the, afghans, had, advanced, north, of, the, lake, to, the, alichur, pamir, p13, in, 1891, russia, sent, a, military, force, to, this, area, and, its, commander, yanov, ordered, the, british, captain, francis, younghusband, to, leave, bozai, gumbaz, in, the, little, pamir, the, russians, claimed, that, because, they, had, annexed, the, khanate, of, kokand, they, had, a, claim, over, the, pamirs, afghanistan, claimed, that, the, region, never, paid, tribute, to, kokand, and, was, independent, so, having, annexed, it, the, region, was, theirs, the, british, claimed, that, this, was, a, breach, of, the, anglo, russian, agreement, of, 1873, unfortunately, for, britain, the, indian, government, pointed, out, that, bozai, gumbaz, was, not, included, in, the, agreement, and, so, it, was, in, an, undefined, zone, bozai, gumbaz, had, not, appeared, on, the, russian, map, as, being, in, wakhan, additionally, the, british, became, aware, that, younghusband, had, mistakenly, entered, russian, territory, near, kara, kul, and, could, have, been, arrested, by, the, administrator, there, yanov, offered, a, verbal, apology, if, he, had, mistakenly, entered, the, wakhan, territory, and, the, russian, government, proposed, a, joint, survey, to, agree, on, a, border, in, 1892, the, british, sent, charles, murray, 7th, earl, of, dunmore, to, the, pamirs, to, investigate, britain, was, concerned, that, russia, would, take, advantage, of, chinese, weakness, in, policing, the, area, to, gain, territory, p14, murray, was, engaged, in, some, form, of, diplomacy, or, espionage, but, the, matter, is, not, clear, and, in, 1893, reached, agreement, with, russia, to, demarcate, the, rest, of, the, border, a, process, completed, in, 1895, p14, on, 12, november, 1893, the, agreement, between, great, britain, and, afghanistan, was, signed, in, kabul, the, agreement, reconfirmed, the, 1873, agreement, required, afghanistan, to, withdraw, from, the, territory, north, of, the, amu, darya, that, it, had, occupied, in, 1884, and, called, for, delimitation, of, the, boundary, east, of, lake, sari, when, mortimer, durand, secretary, for, state, of, india, was, appointed, administrator, of, the, gilgit, agency, now, part, of, the, gilgit, baltistan, of, pakistan, he, opened, up, the, region, by, building, roads, telegraph, and, mail, systems, while, maintaining, a, dialogue, with, the, mir, of, gilgit, he, intended, to, improve, the, road, from, kashmir, through, the, princely, states, of, hunza, and, nagar, and, up, to, the, frontier, with, russia, the, mirs, of, nagar, and, hunza, saw, this, as, a, threat, to, their, natural, advantage, of, remoteness, in, 1890, durand, reinforced, chalt, fort, that, was, near, the, border, due, to, the, rumor, that, nagar, and, hunza, fighters, were, about, to, attack, it, and, continued, redeveloping, the, road, up, to, the, fort, in, may, 1891, nagar, and, hunza, sent, a, warning, to, durand, not, to, continue, work, on, the, road, to, the, fort, and, to, vacate, the, fort, which, was, on, the, gilgit, side, of, the, border, else, they, would, regard, it, as, an, act, of, war, durand, reinforced, the, fort, and, accelerated, the, road, construction, to, it, causing, nagar, and, hunza, to, see, this, as, an, escalation, and, so, they, stopped, mail, from, the, british, resident, in, chinese, turkmenistan, through, their, territory, british, india, regarded, this, as, a, breach, of, their, 1889, agreement, with, hunza, and, after, an, ultimatum, was, issued, and, ignored, they, initiated, the, anglo, brusho, campaign, of, 1891, hunza, and, nagar, came, under, a, british, protectorate, in, 1893, on, 11, march, 1895, there, was, an, exchange, of, notes, between, great, britain, and, russia, the, notes, defined, british, and, russian, spheres, of, influence, east, of, lake, sari, qul, by, defining, the, northern, boundary, of, the, wakhan, corridor, east, of, the, lake, this, boundary, was, subsequently, demarcated, by, a, mixed, commission, the, great, game, is, proposed, to, have, ended, on, 10, september, 1895, with, the, signing, of, the, pamir, boundary, commission, protocols, when, the, border, between, afghanistan, and, the, russian, empire, was, defined, p14, the, pamir, boundary, commission, was, conducted, by, major, general, gerard, who, met, with, a, russian, deputation, under, general, povalo, shveikovsky, in, the, remote, pamir, region, in, 1895, who, were, charged, with, demarcating, the, boundary, between, russian, and, british, spheres, of, interest, from, lake, victoria, eastwards, to, the, chinese, border, the, report, of, the, commission, proved, the, absolute, impracticality, of, any, russian, invasion, of, india, through, the, pamir, mountains, the, result, was, that, afghanistan, became, a, buffer, state, between, the, two, powers, it, was, agreed, that, the, amu, darya, river, would, form, the, border, between, afghanistan, and, the, russian, empire, the, agreements, also, resulted, in, the, russian, empire, losing, control, of, most, afghan, territory, it, conquered, with, the, exception, of, panjdeh, the, pamir, mountains, were, demarcated, as, a, border, line, between, the, russian, empire, and, afghanistan, as, well, the, taghdumbash, would, be, the, subject, of, a, later, afghan, china, agreement, to, conclude, their, agreement, one, peak, was, named, mount, concord, in, exchange, for, a, british, agreement, to, use, the, term, nicholas, range, in, honor, of, the, emperor, nicholas, ii, of, russia, on, official, maps, the, russians, agreed, to, refer, to, lake, zorkul, as, lake, victoria, in, honour, of, queen, victoria, of, the, united, kingdom, the, russians, had, gained, all, of, the, lands, north, of, the, amu, darya, which, included, the, land, claimed, by, the, khanate, of, khiva, including, the, approaches, to, herat, and, all, of, the, land, claimed, by, the, khanate, of, khoqand, including, the, pamir, plateau, to, ensure, a, complete, separation, this, new, afghan, state, was, given, an, odd, eastern, appendage, known, as, the, wakhan, corridor, in, setting, these, boundaries, the, final, act, of, the, tense, game, played, out, by, the, british, and, russian, governments, came, to, a, close, in, the, anglo, russian, convention, of, 1907, the, russian, empire, and, british, empire, officially, ended, their, rivalry, to, focus, on, opposing, the, german, empire, in, the, convention, of, 1907, russia, recognized, afghanistan, and, southern, iran, as, part, of, the, british, sphere, of, influence, while, britain, recognized, central, asia, and, northern, iran, as, part, of, the, russian, sphere, of, influence, both, parties, recognized, tibet, as, a, neutral, territory, except, russia, had, special, privileges, in, negotiating, with, the, dalai, lama, and, britain, had, special, privileges, in, tibetan, commercial, deals, for, a, time, the, british, and, russian, empires, moved, together, against, potential, german, entrance, into, the, great, game, and, against, a, constitutional, movement, in, iran, that, threatened, to, dispel, the, two, way, sphere, of, influence, russia, had, earlier, established, the, persian, cossack, brigade, in, 1879, a, force, which, was, led, by, russian, officers, and, served, as, a, vehicle, for, russian, influence, in, iran, in, 1908, the, persian, constitutional, revolution, sought, to, establish, a, western, oriented, democratic, civil, society, in, iran, with, an, elected, majilis, a, relatively, free, press, and, other, reforms, seeking, to, resolve, financial, problems, of, the, qajar, dynasty, such, as, heavy, debts, to, imperial, russia, and, britain, the, majilis, recruited, the, american, financial, expert, morgan, schuster, who, later, wrote, the, book, the, strangling, of, persia, condemning, britain, and, russia, the, russian, empire, intervened, in, the, persian, constitutional, revolution, to, support, the, shah, and, abolish, the, constitution, the, cossacks, bombarded, the, majilis, in, june, 1908, and, occupied, tehran, additional, brigades, of, the, russian, army, were, also, deployed, to, assist, the, shah, and, occupied, tabriz, after, april, 1909, nonetheless, the, constitutionalists, were, able, to, retake, the, capital, and, were, initially, victorious, with, the, triumph, of, tehran, in, july, 1909, and, dispelled, mohammad, ali, shah, qajar, who, was, exiled, and, took, refuge, with, the, russians, when, a, new, ruler, ahmad, shah, qajar, took, power, he, found, it, difficult, to, completely, reverse, the, constitutional, reforms, yet, the, qajar, state, was, weakened, by, the, upheaval, and, the, qajar, court, dependent, on, foreign, powers, meanwhile, britain, and, russia, aligned, to, oust, shuster, from, iran, by, an, ultimatum, in, 1911, which, was, unanimously, rejected, by, the, majilis, british, and, russian, officials, coordinated, as, the, russian, army, still, present, in, persia, invaded, the, capital, again, and, suspended, the, parliament, the, tsar, ordered, the, troops, in, tabriz, to, act, harshly, and, quickly, while, purges, were, ordered, leading, to, many, executions, of, prominent, revolutionaries, the, british, ambassador, george, head, barclay, reportedly, disapproved, of, this, reign, of, terror, though, would, soon, pressure, persian, ministers, to, officialize, the, anglo, russian, partition, of, iran, by, june, 1914, russia, established, near, total, control, over, its, northern, zone, while, britain, had, established, influence, over, baluch, and, bakhtiari, autonomous, tribal, leaders, in, the, southeastern, zone, qajar, iran, would, become, a, battleground, between, russian, ottoman, and, british, forces, in, the, persian, campaign, of, world, war, i, historians, do, not, agree, on, dating, the, beginning, or, end, of, the, great, game, konstantin, penzev, believes, that, the, great, game, commenced, with, russia, s, victory, in, the, russo, persian, war, 1804, 13, and, the, signing, of, the, treaty, of, gulistan, of, 1813, or, the, treaty, of, turkmenchay, of, 1828, edward, ingram, believes, that, it, began, between, 1832, and, 1834, as, an, attempt, to, negotiate, trade, deals, with, ranjit, singh, and, the, amirs, of, sind, hopkirk, views, unofficial, british, support, for, circassian, anti, russian, fighters, in, the, caucasus, c, 1836, involving, david, urquhart, and, for, example, the, vixen, affair, in, the, context, of, the, great, game, sergeev, believes, that, the, great, game, started, in, the, aftermath, of, the, caucasus, war, 1828, 59, and, intensified, with, the, crimean, war, 1853, 56, 94, edward, ingram, proposes, that, the, great, game, was, over, at, the, end, of, the, first, anglo, afghanistan, war, in, 1842, with, the, british, withdrawal, from, afghanistan, british, fears, ended, in, 1907, and, the, great, game, came, to, a, close, in, 1907, when, britain, and, russia, became, military, allies, with, france, they, made, three, anglo, russian, agreements, which, delineated, spheres, of, interest, between, british, india, and, russian, central, asia, in, the, borderland, areas, of, persia, afghanistan, and, tibet, 276, 298, however, historian, elena, andreeva, sets, the, endpoint, with, the, bolshevik, revolution, in, 1917, and, the, temporary, end, of, russia, s, interest, in, persia, konstantin, penzev, has, stated, echoing, kipling, s, fictional, summary, when, everyone, is, dead, the, great, game, is, finished, not, before, that, unofficially, the, great, game, in, central, asia, will, never, end, according, to, german, historian, david, x, noack, the, great, game, resumed, from, 1919, to, 1933, as, a, conflict, between, britain, and, the, soviet, union, with, the, weimar, republic, and, japan, as, additional, players, noack, calls, it, a, second, tournament, of, shadows, over, the, territory, composing, the, border, of, british, india, china, the, soviet, union, and, japanese, manchuria, to, britain, the, germans, initially, appeared, to, be, a, secret, soviet, ally, in, 1933, 1934, it, ended, with, mongolia, soviet, central, asia, tannu, tuva, and, xinjiang, isolated, from, non, soviet, influence, authors, andrei, znamenski, and, alexandre, andreyev, also, describe, the, continuation, of, elements, of, the, great, game, by, the, soviet, union, until, the, 1930s, focused, on, secret, diplomacy, and, espionage, in, tibet, and, mongolia, edward, ingram, proposes, that, britain, lost, the, great, game, the, great, game, was, an, aspect, of, british, history, rather, than, international, relations, the, phrase, describes, what, the, british, were, doing, not, the, actions, of, russians, and, chinese, the, great, game, was, an, attempt, made, in, the, 1830s, by, the, british, to, impose, their, view, on, the, world, if, khiva, and, bukhara, were, to, become, buffer, states, then, trade, routes, to, afghanistan, as, a, protectorate, along, the, indus, and, sutlej, rivers, would, be, necessary, and, therefore, access, through, the, sind, and, punjab, regions, would, be, required, the, great, game, began, between, 1832, and, 1834, as, an, attempt, to, negotiate, trade, deals, with, ranjit, singh, and, the, amirs, of, sind, and, the, first, interruption, of, this, magnificent, british, daydream, was, caused, by, the, determination, of, the, amirs, of, sind, to, be, left, alone, its, failure, occurred, at, the, end, of, the, first, anglo, afghanistan, war, in, 1842, with, the, british, withdrawal, from, afghanistan, the, failure, to, turn, afghanistan, into, a, client, state, meant, that, the, great, game, could, not, be, won, nonetheless, britain, would, win, a, decisive, victory, in, the, second, anglo, afghan, war, which, occurred, between, 1878, and, 1880, the, victory, also, strengthened, britain, s, influence, in, afghanistan, which, had, become, a, british, protectorate, in, 1889, lord, curzon, who, later, became, viceroy, of, india, 1899, 1905, wrote, a, book, on, the, strategic, balance, between, the, russian, and, british, empires, as, well, as, his, travels, on, the, trans, caspian, railway, in, that, book, russia, in, central, asia, in, 1889, the, anglo, russian, question, he, commented, our, relations, with, afghanistan, in, the, forty, years, between, 1838, and, 1878, were, successively, those, of, blundering, interference, and, of, unmasterly, inactivity, however, he, also, portrayed, the, great, game, as, a, then, ongoing, and, future, event, in, 1889, stating, the, transcaspian, conquests, of, the, czar, have, brought, about, and, the, seal, upon, which, has, been, set, by, the, completion, of, the, new, railway, the, power, of, menace, which, the, ability, to, take, herat, involves, has, passed, from, english, to, russian, hands, the, russian, seizure, of, herat, is, now, a, matter, not, so, much, of, war, as, of, time, and, that, the, russians, will, thus, without, an, effort, win, the, first, hand, in, the, great, game, that, is, destined, to, be, played, for, the, empire, of, the, east, russia, remained, a, focus, for, curzon, through, and, after, his, time, as, viceroy, of, india, in, the, 1850s, karl, marx, and, friedrich, engels, accused, mp, and, pm, lord, palmerston, of, colluding, with, russia, during, the, crimean, war, at, the, time, marx, alleged, that, palmerston, weakened, britain, s, defense, of, the, ottoman, empire, although, this, view, was, not, otherwise, widespread, the, same, accusation, was, levied, by, david, urquhart, 1805, 1877, mail, communications, between, london, and, calcutta, could, take, as, long, as, three, months, either, way, long, distance, telegraph, lines, were, built, across, russia, in, the, 1850s, in, 1870, the, indo, european, telegraph, line, was, completed, and, it, provided, a, communication, link, between, london, and, calcutta, after, passing, through, russia, for, the, first, time, the, india, office, within, the, british, foreign, office, could, telegraph, its, orders, and, have, them, acted, on, in, a, timely, manner, the, government, in, westminster, now, had, complete, control, over, foreign, policy, in, india, and, the, governor, general, of, india, lost, the, discretion, that, he, once, enjoyed, in, 1868, russia, moved, against, bukhara, and, occupied, samarkand, prince, gorchakov, wrote, in, the, gorchakov, memorandum, of, 1874, that, the, russian, ambassador, to, britain, offered, an, explanation, that, satisfied, clarendon, the, british, foreign, secretary, clarendon, replied, that, the, rapid, advance, of, russian, troops, neither, alarmed, nor, surprised, the, british, government, however, it, did, the, british, public, and, the, indian, government, clarendon, proposed, a, neutral, zone, between, britain, and, russia, in, the, region, a, view, that, was, shared, by, the, russian, government, this, led, to, a, confidential, meeting, in, wiesbaden, between, clarendon, and, count, brunow, the, russian, imperial, secretary, after, the, signing, of, the, anglo, russian, agreement, of, 1873, that, was, followed, by, russia, s, occupation, of, khiva, gorchakov, wrote, in, the, gorchakov, memorandum, of, 1874, that, although, the, khanate, of, khiva, remained, entirely, in, our, sphere, of, action, we, thought, we, would, make, an, act, of, courtesy, of, not, adopting, any, decisive, measure, against, khiva, before, having, informed, britain, of, it, in, november, 1874, lord, augustus, loftus, british, ambassador, to, russia, called, on, russia, s, v, westmann, acting, minister, for, foreign, affairs, and, told, him, that, the, advance, of, russia, in, central, asia, of, late, years, was, a, subject, of, watchful, interest, although, it, was, not, one, of, either, jealousy, or, fear, to, the, government, of, india, in, december, 1874, long, before, russia, annexed, merv, in, 1884, northbrook, the, viceroy, of, india, wrote, to, salisbury, the, secretary, of, state, for, india, that, he, accepted, an, eventual, russian, annexation, of, merv, in, the, following, year, he, wrote, to, rawlinson, a, member, of, the, council, of, india, our, engagement, with,

central, asia, between, themselves, britain, and, russia, officially, ended, their, dispute, with, the, anglo, russian, convention, of, 1907, and, afterward, cooperated, to, enforce, its, provisions, on, qajar, iran, while, covert, rivalry, continued, narendra, singh, sarila, aide, de, camp, to, lord, louis, mountbatten, the, last, viceroy, of, british, india, in, 1948, describes, in, his, book, the, shadow, of, the, great, game, that, based, on, his, research, in, the, oriental, and, india, collection, of, british, library, that, the, partition, of, india, was, partially, connected, to, the, great, game, between, britain, and, the, ussr, he, stated, the, following, in, his, book, once, the, british, realized, that, the, indian, nationalists, who, would, rule, india, after, its, independence, would, deny, them, military, cooperation, under, a, british, commonwealth, defence, umbrella, they, settled, for, those, willing, to, do, so, by, using, religion, for, the, purpose, their, problem, could, be, solved, if, mohammad, ali, jinnah, the, leader, of, the, muslim, league, party, would, succeed, in, his, plan, to, detach, the, northwest, of, india, abutting, iran,

ocean, the, report, in, respect, of, which, was, submitted, on, 19, may, 1945, he, states, in, the, book, the, report, emphasized, that, britain, must, retain, its, military, connection, with, the, subcontinent, so, as, to, ward, off, the, soviet, union, s, threat, to, the, area, citing, four, reasons, for, the, strategic, importance, of, india, to, britain, india, s, value, as, a, base, from, which, forces, could, be, suitably, deployed, within, the, indian, ocean, area, in, the, middle, east, and, the, far, east, it, serving, as, a, transit, point, for, air, and, sea, communications, it,

s, use, of, the, term, was, entirely, fictional, because, the, great, game, as, it, is, described, in, the, novel, never, existed, it, is, almost, entirely, kipling, s, invention, at, the, time, when, the, story, is, set, i, e, in, the, late, eighties, britain, did, not, have, an, intelligence, service, nor, an, ethnographical, department, there, was, only, a, governmental, task, force, called, survey, of, india, that, was, entrusted, with, the, task, of, charting, all, india, in, response, to, a, typically, english, anxiety, of, control, according, to, military, history, scholar, matt, salyer, the, great, game, as, a, british, strategy, was, a, fiction, but, the, great, game, as, a, vague, descriptor, of, various, actions, of, multiple, empires, as, far, back, as, the, seven, years, war, is, accurate, he, writes, that, the, legend, of, the, great, game, emerged, as, a, distinct, historiographical, lens, after, the, second, world, war, however, he, says, that, does, not, mean, that, historians, who, describe, trajectories, of, british, imperial, statecraft, in, terms, of, the, great, game, are, wrong, two, authors, gerald, morgan, and, malcolm, yapp, have, proposed, that, the, great, game, was, a, legend, and, that, the, british, raj, did, not, have, the, capacity, to, conduct, such, an, undertaking, an, examination, of, the, archives, of, the, various, departments, of, the, raj, showed, no, evidence, of, a, british, intelligence, network, in, central, asia, at, best, efforts, to, obtain, information, on, russian, moves, in, central, asia, were, rare, ad, hoc, adventures, and, at, worst, intrigues, resembling, the, adventures, in, kim, were, baseless, rumours, and, that, such, rumours, were, always, common, currency, in, central, asia, and, they, applied, as, much, to, russia, as, to, britain, after, two, british, representatives, were, executed, in, bukhara, in, 1842, britain, actively, discouraged, officers, from, traveling, in, turkestan, gerald, morgan, also, proposed, that, russia, never, had, the, will, nor, ability, to, move, on, india, nor, india, the, capability, to, move, on, central, asia, russia, did, not, want, afghanistan, considering, their, initial, failure, to, take, khiva, and, the, british, debacle, in, the, first, anglo, afghan, war, to, invade, afghanistan, they, would, first, require, a, forward, base, in, khorasan, persia, st, petersburg, had, decided, by, then, that, a, forward, policy, in, the, region, had, failed, but, one, of, non, intervention, appeared, to, work, sneh, manajan, wrote, that, the, russian, military, advances, in, central, asia, were, advocated, and, executed, only, by, irresponsible, russians, or, enthusiastic, governors, of, the, frontier, provinces, robert, middleton, suggested, that, the, great, game, was, all, a, figment, of, the, over, excited, imaginations, of, a, few, jingoist, politicians, military, officers, and, journalists, on, both, sides, the, use, of, the, term, the, great, game, to, describe, anglo, russian, rivalry, in, central, asia, became, common, only, after, the, second, world, war, it, was, rarely, used, before, that, period, malcolm, yapp, proposed, that, some, britons, had, used, the, term, the, great, game, in, the, late, 19th, century, to, describe, several, different, things, in, relation, to, its, interests, in, asia, but, the, primary, concern, of, british, authorities, in, india, was, the, control, of, the, indigenous, population, and, not, preventing, a, russian, invasion, robert, irwin, argues, the, great, game, was, certainly, perceived, by, both, british, and, russian, adventurers, at, the, time, but, was, played, up, by, more, expansionist, factions, for, power, politics, in, europe, irwin, states, that, prince, ukhtomsky, might, rail, against, the, corrupting, effects, of, british, rule, over, india, and, declare, that, there, could, be, no, frontiers, for, the, russians, in, asia, but, russian, policy, was, usually, decided, by, saner, heads, canny, statesmen, such, as, witte, sanctioned, the, despatch, of, diplomatic, missions, explorers, and, spies, into, afghanistan, and, tibet, but, they, did, so, to, extort, concessions, from, the, british, in, europe, whitehall, on, the, other, hand, was, reluctant, to, have, its, foreign, policy, in, europe, dictated, to, by, the, raj, according, to, historian, patrikeeff, the, concept, of, the, great, game, was, also, applied, possibly, inaccurately, to, northeast, asia, to, describe, russia, and, japan, s, contest, over, manchuria, which, took, the, form, of, the, russian, invasion, of, manchuria, russo, japanese, war, and, part, of, the, russian, civil, war, and, perhaps, had, similar, ideological, underpinnings, to, start, with, however, unlike, the, british, russian, great, game, in, south, and, west, asia, where, clear, cut, spheres, of, influence, were, established, patrikeeff, says, that, this, supposed, great, game, in, northeast, asia, ignored, that, economic, dominance, did, not, follow, political, with, japan, s, victory, in, manchuria, not, fully, ousting, the, russian, concessions, such, as, the, cer, and, that, centuries, old, distinct, traditions, such, as, the, qing, legacy, there, led, to, key, differences, nonetheless, ancient, and, even, mythic, appeals, to, legitimacy, were, used, by, exiled, supporters, of, empire, such, as, baron, roman, von, ungern, sternberg, s, attempt, at, reviving, a, new, mongolian, khanate, whereas, the, great, game, between, russia, and, britain, was, codifying, imperial, spheres, of, influence, at, their, frontiers, the, supposed, great, game, between, russia, and, japan, did, not, end, up, in, a, similarly, defined, frontier, with, warlord, states, and, honghuzi, emerging, through, the, period, several, scholars, have, focused, on, the, role, of, legends, and, mysticism, sometimes, interpreted, as, a, form, of, orientalism, that, was, prominent, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, during, the, great, game, and, in, its, aftermath, some, writers, such, as, karl, meyer, and, shareen, brysac, have, connected, the, great, game, to, earlier, and, later, expeditions, in, inner, asia, predominantly, those, expeditions, by, british, russian, and, german, orientalists, robert, irwin, summarizes, the, expeditions, as, william, moorcroft, the, horse, doctor, with, a, mission, to, find, new, stock, for, the, cavalry, in, british, india, charles, metcalfe, the, advocate, of, a, forward, policy, on, the, frontier, in, the, early, 19th, century, alexander, bokhara, burnes, the, foolhardy, political, officer, who, perished, at, the, hands, of, an, afghan, mob, sir, william, hay, macnaghten, the, head, of, the, ill, fated, british, mission, in, kabul, and, a, scholar, who, produced, an, important, edition, of, the, arabian, nights, nikolai, przhevalsky, the, explorer, who, gave, his, name, to, a, hard, to, spell, horse, francis, younghusband, the, mystical, imperialist, aurel, stein, the, manuscript, hunter, sven, hedin, the, nazi, sympathiser, who, seems, to, have, regarded, asian, exploration, as, a, proving, ground, for, the, superman, nicholas, roerich, the, artist, and, barmy, quester, after, the, fabled, hidden, city, of, shambhala, the, founder, of, theosophy, esotericist, helena, blavatsky, has, also, been, connected, to, the, great, game, with, her, himalayas, inspired, western, mysticism, both, critiquing, and, falling, for, two, forms, of, orientalism, by, the, british, and, russian, empires, as, they, competed, to, define, and, claim, the, orient, blavatsky, would, be, referenced, by, the, poet, velimir, khlebnikov, who, argued, that, britain, and, russia, had, both, taken, traits, from, the, kazan, khanate, and, mongol, empire, respectively, in, their, colonial, struggle, over, asia, blavatsky, would, also, refer, to, russia, s, double, layered, conception, of, itself, as, a, european, power, in, contrast, to, asia, as, well, as, an, empire, based, in, asia, meanwhile, she, would, also, consciously, appropriate, british, rhetoric, on, russia, in, labelling, herself, a, russian, savage, both, blavatsky, and, khlebnikov, claimed, kalmyk, ancestry, in, imitation, of, the, traditionally, nomadic, culture, scholar, anindita, banerjee, argued, this, shows, a, deconstruction, of, national, identities, by, identifying, with, a, religious, geographic, and, ethnic, other, relevant, to, the, diversity, of, central, asia, and, india, and, the, frontier, that, existed, between, the, british, and, russian, empires, according, to, the, scholar, andrei, znamenski, soviet, communists, of, the, 1920s, aimed, to, extend, their, influence, over, mongolia, and, tibet, using, the, mythical, buddhist, kingdom, of, shambhala, as, a, form, of, propaganda, to, further, this, mission, in, a, sort, of, great, bolshevik, game, the, expedition, of, russian, symbolist, nicholas, roerich, has, been, put, in, context, of, the, great, game, due, to, his, interest, in, tibet, although, roerich, did, not, like, the, communists, he, agreed, to, help, soviet, intelligence, and, influence, operations, due, to, a, shared, paranoia, towards, britain, as, well, as, his, goal, to, form, a, sacred, union, of, the, east, 181, 182, jan, morris, states, that, roerich, brought, the, bewilderments, of, the, later, great, game, to, america, through, mysticism, movements, called, roerichism, in, the, early, 1920s, roerich, asserted, that, beings, from, an, esoteric, buddhist, community, in, india, told, him, that, russia, was, destined, for, a, mission, on, earth, that, led, roerich, to, formulate, his, great, plan, which, envisaged, the, unification, of, millions, of, asian, peoples, through, a, religious, movement, using, the, future, buddha, or, maitreya, into, a, second, union, of, the, east, there, the, king, of, shambhala, would, following, the, maitreya, prophecies, make, his, appearance, to, fight, a, great, battle, against, all, evil, forces, on, earth, roerich, understood, that, as, perfection, towards, common, good, the, new, polity, was, to, include, southwestern, altai, tuva, buryatia, outer, and, inner, mongolia, xinjiang, and, tibet, with, its, capital, in, zvenigorod, the, city, of, tolling, bells, which, was, to, be, built, at, the, foot, of, mount, belukha, in, altai, according, to, roerich, the, same, mahatmas, revealed, to, him, in, 1922, that, he, was, an, incarnation, of, the, fifth, dalai, lama, the, soviet, invasion, of, afghanistan, invited, comparisons, to, the, great, game, in, the, 1980s, concerns, of, resource, scarcity, emerged, once, again, in, the, 1990s, and, with, it, the, hope, that, the, newly, independent, states, of, central, asia, and, the, caucasus, would, provide, a, resource, boom, the, new, persian, gulf, and, with, it, competition, for, oil, and, gas, in, a, 21st, century, version, of, the, great, game, these, expectations, were, not, supported, by, the, facts, and, came, with, an, exaggeration, of, the, region, s, commercial, and, geopolitical, value, since, that, time, some, journalists, have, used, the, expression, the, new, great, game, to, describe, what, they, proposed, was, a, renewed, geopolitical, interest, in, central, asia, because, of, the, mineral, wealth, of, the, region, which, was, at, that, time, becoming, more, available, to, foreign, investment, after, the, end, of, the, soviet, union, one, journalist, linked, the, term, to, an, interest, in, the, region, s, minerals, and, another, to, its, minerals, and, energy, the, interest, in, oil, and, gas, includes, pipelines, that, transmit, energy, to, china, s, east, coast, one, view, of, the, new, great, game, is, a, shift, to, geoeconomic, compared, to, geopolitical, competition, xiangming, chen, believes, that, china, and, russia, are, the, two, dominant, power, players, vs, the, weaker, independent, central, asian, states, other, authors, have, criticized, the, reuse, of, the, term, great, game, it, may, imply, that, central, asian, states, are, entirely, the, pawns, of, larger, states, when, this, ignores, the, potentially, counterbalancing, factors, according, to, strategic, analyst, ajay, patnaik, the, new, great, game, is, a, misnomer, because, rather, than, two, empires, focused, on, the, region, as, in, the, past, there, are, now, many, global, and, regional, powers, active, with, the, rise, of, china, and, india, as, major, economic, powers, central, asian, states, have, diversified, their, political, economic, and, security, relationships, david, gosset, of, ceibs, shanghai, states, the, shanghai, cooperation, organization, sco, established, in, 2001, is, showing, that, central, asia, s, actors, have, gained, some, real, degree, of, independence, but, fundamentally, the, china, factor, introduces, a, level, of, predictability, in, the, 2015, international, relations, book, globalizing, central, asia, the, authors, state, that, central, asian, states, have, pursued, a, multivectored, approach, in, balancing, out, the, political, and, economic, interests, of, larger, powers, but, it, has, had, mixed, success, due, to, strategic, reversals, of, administrations, regarding, the, west, china, and, russia, they, suppose, that, china, could, balance, out, russia, however, russia, and, china, have, a, strategic, partnership, since, 2001, according, to, ajay, patnaik, china, has, advanced, carefully, in, the, region, using, the, sco, as, the, main, regional, mechanism, but, never, challenging, russian, interests, in, central, asia, in, the, carnegie, endowment, paul, stronski, and, nicole, ng, wrote, in, 2018, that, china, has, not, fundamentally, challenged, any, russian, interests, in, central, asia, they, suggested, that, china, russia, and, the, west, could, have, mutual, interests, in, regional, stability, in, central, asia, the, great, game, has, been, described, as, a, clich, metaphor, and, there, are, authors, who, have, now, written, on, the, topics, of, the, great, game, in, antarctica, the, world, s, far, north, and, in, outer, space
