1800s, martineau, tocqueville, marx, spencer, le, bon, ward, pareto, t, nnies, veblen, simmel, durkheim, addams, mead, weber, du, bois, mannheim, elias, sociology, as, a, scholarly, discipline, emerged, primarily, out, of, enlightenment, thought, as, a, positivist, science, of, society, shortly, after, the, french, revolution, its, genesis, owed, to, various, key, movements, in, the, philosophy, of, science, and, the, philosophy, of, knowledge, arising, in, reaction, to, such, issues, as, modernity, capitalism, urbanization, rationalization, secularization, colonization, and, imperialism, during, its, nascent, stages, within, the, late, 19th, century, sociological, deliberations, took, particular, interest, in, the, emergence, of, the, modern, nation, state, including, its, constituent, institutions, units, of, socialization, and, its, means, of, surveillance, as, such, an, emphasis, on, the, concept, of, modernity, rather, than, the, enlightenment, often, distinguishes, sociological, discourse, from, that, of, classical, political, philosophy, likewise, social, analysis, in, a, broader, sense, has, origins, in, the, common, stock, of, philosophy, therefore, pre, dating, the, sociological, field, various, quantitative, social, research, techniques, have, become, common, tools, for, governments, businesses, and, organizations, and, have, also, found, use, in, the, other, social, sciences, divorced, from, theoretical, explanations, of, social, dynamics, this, has, given, social, research, a, degree, of, autonomy, from, the, discipline, of, sociology, similarly, social, science, has, come, to, be, appropriated, as, an, umbrella, term, to, refer, to, various, disciplines, which, study, humans, interaction, society, or, culture, as, a, discipline, sociology, encompasses, a, varying, scope, of, conception, based, on, each, sociologist, s, understanding, of, the, nature, and, scope, of, society, and, its, constituents, creating, a, merely, linear, definition, of, its, science, would, be, improper, in, rationalizing, the, aims, and, efforts, of, sociological, study, from, different, academic, backgrounds, the, codification, of, sociology, as, a, word, concept, and, popular, terminology, is, identified, with, emmanuel, joseph, siey, s, see, 18th, century, section, and, succeeding, figures, from, that, point, onward, it, is, important, to, be, mindful, of, presentism, of, introducing, ideas, of, the, present, into, the, past, around, sociology, below, we, see, figures, that, developed, strong, methods, and, critiques, that, reflect, on, what, we, know, sociology, to, be, today, that, situates, them, as, important, figures, in, knowledge, development, around, sociology, however, the, term, of, sociology, did, not, exist, in, this, period, requiring, careful, language, to, incorporate, these, earlier, efforts, into, the, wider, history, of, sociology, a, more, apt, term, to, use, might, be, proto, sociology, that, outlines, that, the, rough, ingredients, of, sociology, were, present, but, had, no, defined, shape, or, label, to, understand, them, as, sociology, as, we, concepualize, it, today, the, sociological, reasoning, may, be, traced, back, at, least, as, far, as, the, ancient, greeks, whose, characteristic, trends, in, sociological, thought, can, be, traced, back, to, their, social, environment, given, the, rarity, of, extensive, or, highly, centralized, political, organization, within, states, the, tribal, spirit, of, localism, and, provincialism, was, in, open, season, for, deliberations, on, social, phenomena, which, would, thus, pervade, much, of, greek, thought, proto, sociological, observations, can, be, seen, in, the, founding, texts, of, western, philosophy, e, g, herodotus, thucydides, plato, polybius, etc, similarly, the, methodological, survey, can, trace, its, origins, back, to, the, domesday, book, ordered, by, king, of, england, william, the, conqueror, in, 1086, sociological, perspectives, can, also, be, found, among, non, european, thought, of, figures, such, as, confucius, in, the, 13th, century, ma, duanlin, a, chinese, historian, first, recognized, patterns, of, social, dynamics, as, an, underlying, component, of, historical, development, in, his, seminal, encyclopedia, w, nxi, n, t, ngk, o, general, study, of, literary, remains, there, is, evidence, of, early, muslim, sociology, from, the, 14th, century, in, particular, some, consider, islamic, scholar, ibn, khaldun, a, 14th, century, arab, from, tunisia, to, have, been, the, first, sociologist, and, thus, the, father, of, sociology, his, muqaddimah, later, translated, as, prolegomena, in, latin, serving, as, an, introduction, to, a, seven, volume, analysis, of, universal, history, would, perhaps, be, the, first, work, to, advance, social, scientific, reasoning, and, social, philosophy, in, formulating, theories, of, social, cohesion, and, social, conflict, concerning, the, discipline, of, sociology, khaldun, conceived, a, dynamic, theory, of, history, that, involved, conceptualizations, of, social, conflict, and, social, change, he, developed, the, dichotomy, of, sedentary, life, versus, nomadic, life, as, well, as, the, concept, of, generation, and, the, inevitable, loss, of, power, that, occurs, when, desert, warriors, conquer, a, city, following, his, syrian, contemporary, sati, al, husri, the, muqaddimah, may, be, read, as, a, sociological, work, six, books, of, general, sociology, to, be, specific, topics, dealt, with, in, this, work, include, politics, urban, life, economics, and, knowledge, the, work, is, based, around, khaldun, s, central, concept, of, asabiyyah, meaning, social, cohesion, group, solidarity, or, tribalism, khaldun, suggests, such, cohesion, arises, spontaneously, amongst, tribes, and, other, small, kinship, groups, which, can, then, be, intensified, and, enlarged, through, religious, ideology, khaldun, s, analysis, observes, how, this, cohesion, carries, groups, to, power, while, simultaneously, containing, within, itself, the, psychological, sociological, economic, political, seeds, of, the, group, s, downfall, to, be, replaced, by, a, new, group, dynasty, or, empire, bound, by, an, even, stronger, or, at, least, younger, and, more, vigorous, cohesion, the, term, sociologie, was, first, coined, by, the, french, essayist, emmanuel, joseph, siey, s, 1773, 1799, derived, the, latin, socius, companion, joined, with, the, suffix, ology, the, study, of, itself, from, the, greek, l, gos, knowledge, in, 1838, the, french, scholar, auguste, comte, ultimately, gave, sociology, the, definition, that, it, holds, today, comte, had, earlier, expressed, his, work, as, social, physics, however, that, term, would, be, appropriated, by, others, such, as, belgian, statistician, adolphe, quetelet, henri, de, saint, simon, published, physiologie, sociale, in, 1813, devoting, much, of, his, time, to, the, prospect, that, human, society, could, be, steered, toward, progress, if, scientists, would, form, an, international, assembly, to, influence, its, course, he, argued, that, scientists, could, distract, groups, from, war, and, strife, by, focusing, their, attention, to, generally, improving, their, societies, living, conditions, in, turn, this, would, bring, multiple, cultures, and, societies, together, and, prevent, conflict, saint, simon, took, the, idea, that, everyone, had, encouraged, from, the, enlightenment, which, was, the, belief, in, science, and, spun, it, to, be, more, practical, and, hands, on, for, the, society, saint, simon, s, main, idea, was, that, industrialism, would, create, a, new, launch, in, history, he, saw, that, people, had, been, seeing, progress, as, an, approach, for, science, but, he, wanted, them, to, see, it, as, an, approach, to, all, aspects, of, life, society, was, making, a, crucial, change, at, the, time, since, it, was, growing, out, of, a, declining, feudalism, this, new, path, could, provide, the, basis, for, solving, all, the, old, problems, society, had, previously, encountered, he, was, more, concerned, with, the, participation, of, man, in, the, workforce, instead, of, which, workforce, man, choose, his, slogan, became, all, men, must, work, to, which, communism, would, add, and, supply, its, own, slogan, each, according, to, his, capacity, writing, after, the, original, enlightenment, and, influenced, by, the, work, of, saint, simon, political, philosopher, of, social, contract, auguste, comte, hoped, to, unify, all, studies, of, humankind, through, the, scientific, understanding, of, the, social, realm, his, own, sociological, scheme, was, typical, of, the, 19th, century, humanists, he, believed, all, human, life, passed, through, distinct, historical, stages, and, that, if, one, could, grasp, this, progress, one, could, prescribe, the, remedies, for, social, ills, sociology, was, to, be, the, queen, science, in, comte, s, schema, all, basic, physical, sciences, had, to, arrive, first, leading, to, the, most, fundamentally, difficult, science, of, human, society, itself, comte, has, thus, come, to, be, viewed, as, the, father, of, sociology, comte, delineated, his, broader, philosophy, of, science, in, the, course, of, positive, philosophy, c, 1830, 1842, whereas, his, a, general, view, of, positivism, 1848, emphasized, the, particular, goals, of, sociology, comte, would, be, so, impressed, with, his, theory, of, positivism, that, he, referred, to, it, as, the, great, discovery, of, the, year, 1822, comte, s, system, is, based, on, the, principles, of, knowledge, as, seen, in, three, states, this, law, asserts, that, any, kind, of, knowledge, always, begins, in, theological, form, here, the, knowledge, can, be, explained, by, a, superior, supernatural, power, such, as, animism, spirits, or, gods, it, then, passes, to, the, metaphysical, form, where, the, knowledge, is, explained, by, abstract, philosophical, speculation, finally, the, knowledge, becomes, positive, after, being, explained, scientifically, through, observation, experimentation, and, comparison, the, order, of, the, laws, was, created, in, order, of, increasing, difficulty, comte, s, description, of, the, development, of, society, is, parallel, to, karl, marx, s, own, theory, of, historiography, from, capitalism, to, communism, the, two, would, both, be, influenced, by, various, utopian, socialist, thinkers, of, the, day, agreeing, that, some, form, of, communism, would, be, the, climax, of, societal, development, in, later, life, auguste, comte, developed, a, religion, of, humanity, to, give, positivist, societies, the, unity, and, cohesiveness, found, through, the, traditional, worship, people, were, used, to, in, this, new, religion, comte, referred, to, society, as, the, great, being, and, would, promote, a, universal, love, and, harmony, taught, through, the, teachings, of, his, industrial, system, theory, for, his, close, associate, john, stuart, mill, it, was, possible, to, distinguish, between, a, good, comte, the, one, who, wrote, course, in, positive, philosophy, and, a, bad, comte, the, author, of, the, secular, religious, system, the, system, would, be, unsuccessful, but, met, with, the, publication, of, darwin, s, on, the, origin, of, species, to, influence, the, proliferation, of, various, secular, humanist, organizations, in, the, 19th, century, especially, through, the, work, of, secularists, such, as, george, holyoake, and, richard, congreve, harriet, martineau, undertook, an, english, translation, of, cours, de, philosophie, positive, that, was, published, in, two, volumes, in, 1853, as, the, positive, philosophy, of, auguste, comte, freely, translated, and, condensed, by, harriet, martineau, comte, recommended, her, volumes, to, his, students, instead, of, his, own, some, writers, regard, martineau, as, the, first, female, sociologist, her, introduction, of, comte, to, the, english, speaking, world, and, the, elements, of, sociological, perspective, in, her, original, writings, support, her, credit, as, a, sociologist, both, comte, and, marx, intended, to, develop, a, new, scientific, ideology, in, the, wake, of, european, secularization, marx, in, the, tradition, of, hegelianism, rejected, the, positivist, method, and, was, in, turn, rejected, by, the, self, proclaimed, sociologists, of, his, day, however, in, attempting, to, develop, a, comprehensive, science, of, society, marx, nevertheless, became, recognized, as, a, founder, of, sociology, by, the, mid, 20th, century, isaiah, berlin, described, marx, as, the, true, father, of, modern, sociology, in, so, far, as, anyone, can, claim, the, title, to, have, given, clear, and, unified, answers, in, familiar, empirical, terms, to, those, theoretical, questions, which, most, occupied, men, s, minds, at, the, time, and, to, have, deduced, from, them, clear, practical, directives, without, creating, obviously, artificial, links, between, the, two, was, the, principal, achievement, of, marx, s, theory, the, sociological, treatment, of, historical, and, moral, problems, which, comte, and, after, him, spencer, and, taine, had, discussed, and, mapped, became, a, precise, and, concrete, study, only, when, the, attack, of, militant, marxism, made, its, conclusions, a, burning, issue, and, so, made, the, search, for, evidence, more, zealous, and, the, attention, to, method, more, intense, in, the, 1830s, karl, marx, was, part, of, the, young, hegelians, in, berlin, which, discussed, and, wrote, about, the, legacy, of, the, philosopher, george, w, f, hegel, whose, seminal, tome, science, of, logic, was, published, in, 1816, although, at, first, sympathetic, with, the, group, s, strategy, of, attacking, christianity, to, undermine, the, prussian, establishment, he, later, formed, divergent, ideas, and, broke, with, the, young, hegelians, attacking, their, views, in, works, such, as, the, german, ideology, witnessing, the, struggles, of, the, laborers, during, the, industrial, revolution, marx, concluded, that, religion, or, the, ideal, is, not, the, basis, of, the, establishment, s, power, but, rather, ownership, of, capital, or, the, material, processes, that, employ, technologies, land, money, and, especially, human, labor, power, to, create, surplus, value, lie, at, the, heart, of, the, establishment, s, power, this, stood, hegel, on, his, head, as, he, theorized, that, at, its, core, the, engine, of, history, and, the, structure, of, society, was, fundamentally, material, rather, than, ideal, he, theorized, that, both, the, realm, of, cultural, production, and, political, power, created, ideologies, that, perpetuated, the, oppression, of, the, working, class, and, the, concentration, of, wealth, within, the, capitalist, class, the, owners, of, the, means, of, production, marx, predicted, that, the, capitalist, class, would, feel, compelled, to, reduce, wages, or, replace, laborers, with, technology, which, would, ultimately, increase, wealth, among, the, capitalists, however, as, the, workers, were, also, the, primary, consumers, of, the, goods, produced, reducing, their, wages, would, result, in, an, inevitable, collapse, in, capitalism, as, a, mode, of, economic, production, marx, also, co, operated, with, friedrich, engels, who, accused, the, capitalist, class, of, social, murder, for, causing, workers, life, of, toil, and, wretchedness, but, with, a, response, that, tales, no, further, trouble, in, the, matter, this, gives, them, the, power, over, the, workers, health, and, income, which, can, degree, his, life, or, death, his, book, the, condition, of, the, working, class, in, england, 1844, studied, the, life, of, the, proletariat, in, manchester, london, dublin, and, edinburgh, mile, durkheim, s, work, had, importance, as, he, was, concerned, with, how, societies, could, maintain, their, integrity, and, coherence, in, modernity, an, era, in, which, traditional, social, and, religious, ties, are, no, longer, assumed, and, in, which, new, social, institutions, have, come, into, being, durkheim, s, first, major, sociological, work, was, the, division, of, labour, in, society, 1893, in, 1895, he, published, the, rules, of, sociological, method, and, set, up, the, first, european, department, of, sociology, at, what, became, in, 1896, the, university, of, bordeaux, where, he, taught, from, 1887, to, 1902, he, became, france, s, first, professor, of, sociology, in, 1898, he, established, the, journal, l, ann, e, sociologique, durkheim, s, seminal, monograph, suicide, 1897, a, study, of, suicide, rates, in, catholic, and, protestant, populations, pioneered, modern, social, research, and, served, to, distinguish, social, science, from, psychology, and, political, philosophy, the, elementary, forms, of, the, religious, life, 1912, presented, a, theory, of, religion, comparing, the, social, and, cultural, lives, of, aboriginal, and, modern, societies, durkheim, was, deeply, preoccupied, with, the, acceptance, of, sociology, as, a, legitimate, science, he, refined, the, positivism, originally, set, forth, by, auguste, comte, promoting, what, could, be, considered, as, a, form, of, epistemological, realism, as, well, as, the, use, of, the, hypothetico, deductive, model, in, social, science, for, him, sociology, was, the, science, of, institutions, if, this, term, is, understood, in, its, broader, meaning, as, beliefs, and, modes, of, behaviour, instituted, by, the, collectivity, and, its, aim, was, to, discover, structural, social, facts, durkheim, was, a, major, proponent, of, structural, functionalism, a, foundational, perspective, in, both, sociology, and, anthropology, in, his, view, social, science, should, be, purely, holistic, that, is, sociology, should, study, phenomena, attributed, to, society, at, large, rather, than, being, limited, to, the, specific, actions, of, individuals, he, remained, a, dominant, force, in, french, intellectual, life, until, his, death, in, 1917, presenting, numerous, lectures, and, published, works, on, a, variety, of, topics, including, the, sociology, of, knowledge, morality, social, stratification, religion, law, education, and, deviance, durkheimian, terms, such, as, collective, consciousness, have, since, entered, the, popular, lexicon, ferdinand, t, nnies, argued, that, gemeinschaft, and, gesellschaft, were, the, two, normal, types, of, human, association, the, former, was, the, traditional, kind, of, community, with, strong, social, bonds, and, shared, beliefs, while, the, latter, was, the, modern, society, in, which, individualism, and, rationality, had, become, more, dominant, he, also, drew, a, sharp, line, between, the, realm, of, conceptuality, and, the, reality, of, social, action, the, first, must, be, treated, axiomatically, and, in, a, deductive, way, pure, sociology, whereas, the, second, empirically, and, in, an, inductive, way, applied, sociology, his, ideas, were, further, developed, by, max, weber, another, early, german, sociologist, weber, argued, for, the, study, of, social, action, through, interpretive, rather, than, purely, empiricist, means, based, on, understanding, the, purpose, and, meaning, that, individuals, attach, to, their, own, actions, unlike, durkheim, he, did, not, believe, in, monocausal, explanations, and, rather, proposed, that, for, any, outcome, there, can, be, multiple, causes, weber, s, main, intellectual, concern, was, understanding, the, processes, of, rationalisation, secularisation, and, disenchantment, which, he, associated, with, the, rise, of, capitalism, and, modernity, weber, is, also, known, for, his, thesis, combining, economic, sociology, and, the, sociology, of, religion, elaborated, in, his, book, the, protestant, ethic, and, the, spirit, of, capitalism, in, which, he, proposed, that, ascetic, protestantism, was, one, of, the, major, elective, affinities, associated, with, the, rise, in, the, western, world, of, market, driven, capitalism, and, the, rational, legal, nation, state, he, argued, that, it, was, in, the, basic, tenets, of, protestantism, to, boost, capitalism, thus, it, can, be, said, that, the, spirit, of, capitalism, is, inherent, to, protestant, religious, values, against, marx, s, historical, materialism, weber, emphasised, the, importance, of, cultural, influences, embedded, in, religion, as, a, means, for, understanding, the, genesis, of, capitalism, the, protestant, ethic, formed, the, earliest, part, in, weber, s, broader, investigations, into, world, religion, in, another, major, work, politics, as, a, vocation, weber, defined, the, state, as, an, entity, that, successfully, claims, a, monopoly, of, the, legitimate, use, of, physical, force, within, a, given, territory, he, was, also, the, first, to, categorise, social, authority, into, distinct, forms, which, he, labelled, as, charismatic, traditional, and, rational, legal, his, analysis, of, bureaucracy, emphasised, that, modern, state, institutions, are, increasingly, based, on, rational, legal, authority, weber, s, wife, marianne, weber, also, became, a, sociologist, in, her, own, right, writing, about, women, s, issues, she, wrote, wife, and, mother, in, the, development, of, law, which, was, devoted, to, the, analysis, of, the, institution, of, marriage, her, conclusion, was, that, marriage, is, a, complex, and, ongoing, negotiation, over, power, and, intimacy, in, which, money, women, s, work, and, sexuality, are, key, issues, another, theme, in, her, work, was, that, women, s, work, could, be, used, to, map, and, explain, the, construction, and, reproduction, of, the, social, person, and, the, social, world, human, work, creates, cultural, products, ranging, from, small, daily, values, such, as, cleanliness, and, honesty, to, larger, more, abstract, phenomena, like, philosophy, and, language, georg, simmel, was, one, of, the, first, generation, of, german, sociologists, his, neo, kantian, approach, laid, the, foundations, for, sociological, antipositivism, asking, what, is, society, in, a, direct, allusion, to, kant, s, question, what, is, nature, presenting, pioneering, analyses, of, social, individuality, and, fragmentation, for, simmel, culture, referred, to, the, cultivation, of, individuals, through, the, agency, of, external, forms, which, have, been, objectified, in, the, course, of, history, simmel, discussed, social, and, cultural, phenomena, in, terms, of, forms, and, contents, with, a, transient, relationship, form, becoming, content, and, vice, versa, dependent, on, the, context, in, this, sense, he, was, a, forerunner, to, structuralist, styles, of, reasoning, in, the, social, sciences, with, his, work, on, the, metropolis, simmel, was, a, precursor, of, urban, sociology, symbolic, interactionism, and, social, network, analysis, simmel, s, most, famous, works, today, are, the, problems, of, the, philosophy, of, history, 1892, the, philosophy, of, money, 1900, the, metropolis, and, mental, life, 1903, soziologie, 1908, inc, the, stranger, the, social, boundary, the, sociology, of, the, senses, the, sociology, of, space, and, on, the, spatial, projections, of, social, forms, and, fundamental, questions, of, sociology, 1917, herbert, spencer, 1820, 1903, the, english, philosopher, was, one, of, the, most, popular, and, influential, 19th, century, sociologists, although, his, work, has, largely, fallen, out, of, favor, in, contemporary, sociology, the, early, sociology, of, spencer, came, about, broadly, as, a, reaction, to, comte, and, marx, writing, before, and, after, the, darwinian, revolution, in, biology, spencer, attempted, to, reformulate, the, discipline, in, socially, darwinistic, terms, in, fact, his, early, writings, show, a, coherent, theory, of, general, evolution, several, years, before, darwin, published, anything, on, the, subject, encouraged, by, his, friend, and, follower, edward, l, youmans, spencer, published, the, study, of, sociology, in, 1874, which, was, the, first, book, with, the, term, sociology, in, the, title, it, is, estimated, that, he, sold, one, million, books, in, his, lifetime, far, more, than, any, other, sociologist, at, the, time, so, strong, was, his, influence, that, many, other, 19th, century, thinkers, including, mile, durkheim, defined, their, ideas, in, relation, to, his, durkheim, s, division, of, labour, in, society, is, to, a, large, extent, an, extended, debate, with, spencer, from, whose, sociology, durkheim, borrowed, extensively, also, a, notable, biologist, spencer, coined, the, term, survival, of, the, fittest, as, a, basic, mechanism, by, which, more, effective, socio, cultural, forms, progressed, this, means, that, the, strongest, members, of, society, should, not, help, the, weaker, members, of, society, an, example, is, that, the, richest, should, remain, rich, and, the, poor, should, also, remain, poor, as, the, rich, people, would, not, help, the, poor, in, the, 20th, century, spencer, s, work, became, less, influential, in, sociology, because, of, his, social, darwinist, views, on, race, which, are, widely, considered, a, form, of, scientific, racism, for, example, in, his, social, statics, 1850, he, argued, that, imperialism, had, served, civilization, by, clearing, the, inferior, races, off, the, earth, the, forces, which, are, working, out, the, great, scheme, of, perfect, happiness, taking, no, account, of, incidental, suffering, exterminate, such, sections, of, mankind, as, stand, in, their, way, be, he, human, or, be, he, brute, the, hindrance, must, be, got, rid, of, largely, because, of, his, work, on, race, spencer, is, now, described, in, the, academy, as, of, all, the, great, victorian, thinkers, whose, reputation, has, fallen, the, farthest, a, contemporary, of, spencer, lester, frank, ward, is, often, described, as, a, father, of, american, sociology, and, served, as, the, first, president, of, the, american, sociological, association, in, 1905, and, served, as, such, until, 1907, he, published, dynamic, sociology, in, 1883, outlines, of, sociology, in, 1898, pure, sociology, in, 1903, and, applied, sociology, in, 1906, also, in, 1906, at, the, age, of, 65, he, was, appointed, as, professor, of, sociology, at, brown, university, in, july, 1897, w, e, b, du, bois, produced, his, first, major, the, philadelphia, negro, 1899, a, detailed, and, comprehensive, sociological, study, of, the, african, american, people, of, philadelphia, based, on, the, field, work, he, did, in, 1896, 1897, the, work, was, a, breakthrough, in, scholarship, because, it, was, the, first, scientific,

the, black, underclass, later, in, 1903, he, popularized, the, term, the, talented, tenth, applied, to, society, s, elite, class, du, bois, s, terminology, reflected, his, opinion, that, the, elite, of, a, nation, both, black, and, white, were, critical, to, achievements, in, culture, and, progress, to, portray, the, genius, and, humanity, of, the, black, race, du, bois, published, the, souls, of, black, folk, 1903, a, collection, of, 14, essays, the, introduction, famously, proclaimed, that, the, problem, of, the, twentieth, century, is, the, problem, of, the, color, line, a, major, theme, of, the, work, was, the, double, consciousness, faced, by, african, americans, being, both, american, and, black, this, was, a, unique, identity, which, according, to, du, bois, had, been, a, handicap, in, the, past, but, could, be, a, strength, in, the, future, henceforth, the, destiny, of, the, race, could, be, conceived, as, leading, neither, to, assimilation, nor, separatism, but, to, proud, enduring, hyphenation, many, other, philosophers, and, academics, were, influential, in, the, development, of, sociology, not, least, the, enlightenment, theorists, of, social, contract, and, historians, such, as, adam, ferguson, 1723, 1816, for, his, theory, on, social, interaction, ferguson, has, himself, been, described, as, the, father, of, modern, sociology, ferguson, argued, that, capitalism, was, diminishing, social, bonds, that, traditionally, held, communities, together, other, early, works, to, appropriate, the, term, sociology, included, a, treatise, on, sociology, theoretical, and, practical, by, the, north, american, lawyer, henry, hughes, and, sociology, for, the, south, or, the, failure, of, free, society, by, the, american, lawyer, george, fitzhugh, both, books, were, published, in, 1854, in, the, context, of, the, debate, over, slavery, in, the, antebellum, us, harriet, martineau, a, whig, social, theorist, and, the, english, translator, of, many, of, comte, s, works, has, been, cited, as, the, first, female, sociologist, writing, a, study, of, the, united, states, she, noted, how, the, theoretical, ideal, of, equality, apparent, in, the, declaration, of, independence, were, not, reflected, in, the, social, reality, of, the, country, which, marginalised, women, and, practiced, slavery, various, other, early, social, historians, and, economists, have, gained, recognition, as, classical, sociologists, including, robert, michels, 1876, 1936, alexis, de, tocqueville, 1805, 1859, vilfredo, pareto, 1848, 1923, and, thorstein, veblen, 1857, 1926, the, classical, sociological, texts, broadly, differ, from, political, philosophy, in, the, attempt, to, remain, scientific, systematic, structural, or, dialectical, rather, than, purely, moral, normative, or, subjective, the, new, class, relations, associated, with, the, development, of, capitalism, are, also, key, further, distinguishing, sociological, texts, from, the, political, philosophy, of, the, renaissance, and, enlightenment, eras, formal, institutionalization, of, sociology, as, an, academic, discipline, began, when, emile, durkheim, founded, the, first, french, department, of, sociology, at, the, university, of, bordeaux, in, 1895, in, 1896, he, established, the, journal, l, ann, e, sociologique, a, course, entitled, sociology, was, taught, for, the, first, time, in, the, united, states, in, 1875, by, william, graham, sumner, drawing, upon, the, thought, of, comte, and, herbert, spencer, rather, than, the, work, of, durkheim, in, 1890, the, oldest, continuing, sociology, course, in, the, united, states, began, at, the, university, of, kansas, lectured, by, frank, blackmar, the, department, of, history, and, sociology, at, the, university, of, kansas, was, established, in, 1891, and, the, first, full, fledged, independent, university, department, of, sociology, was, established, in, 1892, at, the, university, of, chicago, by, albion, w, small, 1854, 1926, who, in, 1895, founded, the, american, journal, of, sociology, american, sociology, arose, on, a, broadly, independent, trajectory, to, european, sociology, george, herbert, mead, and, charles, h, cooley, were, influential, in, the, development, of, symbolic, interactionism, and, social, psychology, at, the, university, of, chicago, while, lester, ward, emphasized, the, central, importance, of, the, scientific, method, with, the, publication, of, dynamic, sociology, in, 1883, the, first, sociology, department, in, the, united, kingdom, was, founded, at, the, london, school, of, economics, in, 1904, in, 1919, a, sociology, department, was, established, in, germany, at, the, ludwig, maximilian, university, of, munich, by, max, weber, who, had, established, a, new, antipositivist, sociology, the, institute, for, social, research, at, the, university, of, frankfurt, later, to, become, the, frankfurt, school, of, critical, theory, was, founded, in, 1923, critical, theory, would, take, on, something, of, a, life, of, its, own, after, ww2, influencing, literary, theory, and, the, birmingham, school, of, cultural, studies, the, university, of, frankfurt, s, advances, along, with, the, close, proximity, to, the, research, institute, for, sociology, made, germany, a, powerful, force, in, leading, sociology, at, that, time, in, 1918, frankfurt, received, the, funding, to, create, sociology, s, first, department, chair, the, germany, s, groundbreaking, work, influenced, its, government, to, add, the, position, of, minister, of, culture, to, advance, the, country, as, a, whole, the, remarkable, collection, of, men, who, were, contributing, to, the, sociology, department, at, frankfurt, were, soon, getting, worldwide, attention, and, began, being, referred, to, as, the, frankfurt, school, here, they, studied, new, perspectives, on, marx, theories, and, went, into, depth, in, the, works, of, weber, and, freud, most, of, these, men, would, soon, be, forced, out, of, germany, by, the, nazis, moving, to, america, in, the, united, states, they, had, a, significant, influence, on, social, research, this, forced, relocation, of, sociologists, enabled, sociology, in, america, to, rise, up, to, the, standards, of, european, studies, of, sociology, by, planting, some, of, europe, s, greatest, sociologists, in, america, felix, weil, was, one, of, the, students, who, received, their, doctorate, on, the, concept, of, socialization, from, the, university, of, frankfurt, he, along, with, max, horkheimer, and, kurt, albert, gerlach, developed, the, institute, of, social, research, after, it, was, established, in, 1923, kurt, albert, gerlach, would, serve, as, the, institute, s, first, director, their, goal, in, creating, the, institute, was, to, produce, a, place, that, people, could, discover, and, be, informed, of, social, life, as, a, whole, weil, horkheimer, and, gerlach, wanted, to, focus, on, interactions, between, economics, politics, legal, matters, as, well, as, scholarly, interactions, in, the, community, and, society, the, main, research, that, got, the, institute, known, was, its, revival, of, scientific, marxism, many, benefactors, contributed, money, supplies, and, buildings, to, keep, this, area, of, research, going, when, gerlach, became, ill, and, had, to, step, down, as, director, max, horkheimer, took, his, place, he, encouraged, the, students, of, the, institute, to, question, everything, they, studied, if, the, students, studied, a, theory, he, not, only, wanted, them, to, discover, its, truth, themselves, but, also, to, discover, how, and, why, it, is, true, and, the, theories, relation, to, society, the, national, socialist, regime, exiled, many, of, the, members, of, the, institute, of, social, research, the, regime, also, forced, many, students, and, staff, from, the, entire, frankfurt, university, and, most, fled, to, america, the, war, meant, that, the, institute, lost, too, many, people, and, was, forced, to, close, in, 1950, the, institute, was, reopened, as, a, private, establishment, from, this, point, on, the, institute, of, social, research, would, have, a, close, connection, to, sociology, studies, in, the, united, states, in, 1905, the, american, sociological, association, the, world, s, largest, association, of, professional, sociologists, was, founded, and, lester, f, ward, was, selected, to, serve, as, the, first, president, of, the, new, society, the, university, of, chicago, developed, the, major, sociologists, at, the, time, it, brought, them, together, and, even, gave, them, a, hub, and, a, network, to, link, all, the, leading, sociologists, in, 1925, a, third, of, all, sociology, graduate, students, attended, the, university, of, chicago, chicago, was, very, good, at, not, isolating, their, students, from, other, schools, they, encouraged, them, to, blend, with, other, sociologists, and, to, not, spend, more, time, in, the, class, room, than, studying, the, society, around, them, this, would, teach, them, real, life, application, of, the, classroom, teachings, the, first, teachings, at, the, university, of, chicago, were, focused, on, the, social, problems, that, the, world, had, been, dealt, at, this, time, academia, was, not, concerned, with, theory, especially, not, to, the, point, that, academia, is, today, many, people, were, still, hesitant, of, sociology, at, this, time, especially, with, the, recent, controversial, theories, of, weber, and, marx, the, university, of, chicago, decided, to, go, into, an, entirely, different, direction, and, their, sociology, department, directed, their, attention, to, the, individual, and, promoted, equal, rights, their, concentration, was, small, groups, and, discoveries, of, the, individual, s, relationship, to, society, the, program, combined, with, other, departments, to, offer, students, well, rounded, studies, requiring, courses, in, hegemony, economics, psychology, multiple, social, sciences, and, political, science, albion, small, was, the, head, of, the, sociology, program, at, the, university, of, chicago, he, played, a, key, role, in, bringing, german, sociological, advancements, directly, into, american, academic, sociology, small, also, created, the, american, journal, of, sociology, robert, park, and, ernest, burgess, refined, the, program, s, methods, guidelines, and, checkpoints, this, made, the, findings, more, standardized, concise, and, easier, to, comprehend, the, pair, even, wrote, the, sociology, program, s, textbook, for, a, reference, and, get, all, students, on, the, same, page, more, effectively, many, remarkable, sociologists, such, as, george, hebert, mead, w, e, b, du, bois, robert, park, charles, s, johnson, william, ogburn, hebert, blumer, and, many, others, have, significant, ties, to, the, university, of, chicago, in, 1920, a, department, was, set, up, in, poland, by, florian, znaniecki, 1882, 1958, william, i, thomas, was, an, early, graduate, from, the, sociology, department, of, the, university, of, chicago, he, built, upon, his, education, and, his, work, changed, sociology, in, many, ways, in, 1918, william, i, thomas, and, florian, znaniecki, gave, the, world, the, publication, of, the, polish, peasant, in, europe, and, america, this, publication, combined, sociological, theory, with, in, depth, experiential, research, and, thus, launching, methodical, sociological, research, as, a, whole, this, changed, sociologist, s, methods, and, enabled, them, to, see, new, patterns, and, connect, new, theories, this, publication, also, gave, sociologists, a, new, way, to, found, their, research, and, prove, it, on, a, new, level, all, their, research, would, be, more, solid, and, harder, for, society, to, not, pay, attention, to, it, in, 1920, znaniecki, developed, a, sociology, department, in, poland, to, expand, research, and, teachings, there, with, the, lack, of, sociological, theory, being, taught, at, the, university, of, chicago, paired, with, the, new, foundations, of, statistical, methods, the, student, s, ability, to, make, any, real, predictions, was, nonexistent, this, was, a, major, factor, in, the, downfall, of, the, chicago, school, international, cooperation, in, sociology, began, in, 1893, when, ren, worms, 1869, 1926, founded, the, small, institut, international, de, sociologie, eclipsed, by, much, larger, international, sociological, association, from, 1949, durkheim, marx, and, weber, are, typically, cited, as, the, three, principal, architects, of, modern, social, science, the, sociological, canon, of, classics, with, durkheim, and, weber, at, the, top, owes, in, part, to, talcott, parsons, who, is, largely, credited, with, introducing, both, to, american, audiences, parsons, structure, of, social, action, 1937, consolidated, the, american, sociological, tradition, and, set, the, agenda, for, american, sociology, at, the, point, of, its, fastest, disciplinary, growth, in, parsons, canon, however, vilfredo, pareto, holds, greater, significance, than, either, marx, or, simmel, his, canon, was, guided, by, a, desire, to, unify, the, divergent, theoretical, traditions, in, sociology, behind, a, single, theoretical, scheme, one, that, could, in, fact, be, justified, by, purely, scientific, developments, in, the, discipline, during, the, previous, half, century, while, the, secondary, role, marx, plays, in, early, american, sociology, may, be, attributed, to, parsons, as, well, as, to, broader, political, trends, the, dominance, of, marxism, in, european, sociological, thought, had, long, since, secured, the, rank, of, marx, alongside, durkheim, and, weber, as, one, of, the, three, classical, sociologists, the, methodological, approach, toward, sociology, by, early, theorists, was, to, treat, the, discipline, in, broadly, the, same, manner, as, natural, science, an, emphasis, on, empiricism, and, the, scientific, method, was, sought, to, provide, an, incontestable, foundation, for, any, sociological, claims, or, findings, and, to, distinguish, sociology, from, less, empirical, fields, such, as, philosophy, this, perspective, termed, positivism, was, first, developed, by, theorist, auguste, comte, positivism, was, founded, on, the, theory, that, the, only, true, factual, knowledge, is, scientific, knowledge, comte, had, very, vigorous, guidelines, for, a, theory, to, be, considered, positivism, he, thought, that, this, authentic, knowledge, can, only, be, derived, from, positive, confirmation, of, theories, through, strict, continuously, tested, methods, that, are, not, only, scientifically, but, also, quantitatively, based, mile, durkheim, was, a, major, proponent, of, theoretically, grounded, empirical, research, seeking, correlations, to, reveal, structural, laws, or, social, facts, durkheim, proved, that, concepts, that, had, been, attributed, to, the, individual, were, actually, socially, determined, these, occurrences, are, things, such, as, suicide, crime, moral, outrage, a, person, s, personality, time, space, and, god, he, brought, to, light, that, society, had, influence, on, all, aspects, of, a, person, far, more, than, had, been, previously, believed, for, him, sociology, could, be, described, as, the, science, of, institutions, their, genesis, and, their, functioning, durkheim, endeavoured, to, apply, sociological, findings, in, the, pursuit, of, political, reform, and, social, solidarity, today, scholarly, accounts, of, durkheim, s, positivism, may, be, vulnerable, to, exaggeration, and, oversimplification, comte, was, the, only, major, sociological, thinker, to, postulate, that, the, social, realm, may, be, subject, to, scientific, analysis, in, the, same, way, as, noble, science, whereas, durkheim, acknowledged, in, greater, detail, the, fundamental, epistemological, limitations, reactions, against, positivism, began, when, german, philosopher, georg, wilhelm, friedrich, hegel, 1770, 1831, voiced, opposition, to, both, empiricism, which, he, rejected, as, uncritical, and, determinism, which, he, viewed, as, overly, mechanistic, karl, marx, s, methodology, borrowed, from, hegel, dialecticism, but, also, a, rejection, of, positivism, in, favour, of, critical, analysis, seeking, to, supplement, the, empirical, acquisition, of, facts, with, the, elimination, of, illusions, he, maintained, that, appearances, need, to, be, critiqued, rather, than, simply, documented, marx, nonetheless, endeavoured, to, produce, a, science, of, society, grounded, in, the, economic, determinism, of, historical, materialism, other, philosophers, including, wilhelm, dilthey, 1833, 1911, and, heinrich, rickert, 1863, 1936, argued, that, the, natural, world, differs, from, the, social, world, because, of, those, unique, aspects, of, human, society, meanings, signs, and, so, on, which, inform, human, cultures, in, italy, speculative, knowledge, prevails, over, positivistic, sociological, science, where, the, forms, of, attraction, of, the, social, sciences, are, vitiated, by, the, self, reformism, of, morality, and, the, self, assertion, of, science, the, process, lasts, until, the, 1950s, after, that, there, is, a, revival, and, sociological, science, gradually, asserts, itself, as, an, academic, discipline, see, guglielmo, rinzivillo, science, and, the, object, self, criticism, of, strategic, knowledge, milan, franco, angeli, 2010, p, 52, ff, isbn, 9788856824872, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, the, first, generation, of, german, sociologists, formally, introduced, methodological, antipositivism, proposing, that, research, should, concentrate, on, human, cultural, norms, values, symbols, and, social, processes, viewed, from, a, subjective, perspective, max, weber, argued, that, sociology, may, be, loosely, described, as, a, science, as, it, is, able, to, identify, causal, relationships, especially, among, ideal, types, or, hypothetical, simplifications, of, complex, social, phenomena, as, a, nonpositivist, however, one, seeks, relationships, that, are, not, as, ahistorical, invariant, or, generalizable, as, those, pursued, by, natural, scientists, both, weber, and, georg, simmel, pioneered, the, verstehen, or, interpretative, approach, toward, social, science, a, systematic, process, in, which, an, outside, observer, attempts, to, relate, to, a, particular, cultural, group, or, indigenous, people, on, their, own, terms, and, from, their, own, point, of, view, through, the, work, of, simmel, in, particular, sociology, acquired, a, possible, character, beyond, positivist, data, collection, or, grand, deterministic, systems, of, structural, law, relatively, isolated, from, the, sociological, academy, throughout, his, lifetime, simmel, presented, idiosyncratic, analyses, of, modernity, more, reminiscent, of, the, phenomenological, and, existential, writers, than, of, comte, or, durkheim, paying, particular, concern, to, the, forms, of, and, possibilities, for, social, individuality, his, sociology, engaged, in, a, neo, kantian, critique, of, the, limits, of, perception, asking, what, is, society, in, a, direct, allusion, to, kant, s, question, what, is, nature, in, the, early, 20th, century, sociology, expanded, in, the, u, s, including, developments, in, both, macrosociology, concerned, with, the, evolution, of, societies, and, microsociology, concerned, with, everyday, human, social, interactions, based, on, the, pragmatic, social, psychology, of, george, herbert, mead, 1863, 1931, herbert, blumer, 1900, 1987, and, later, the, chicago, school, sociologists, developed, symbolic, interactionism, in, the, 1920s, gy, rgy, luk, cs, released, history, and, class, consciousness, 1923, while, a, number, of, works, by, durkheim, and, weber, were, published, posthumously, during, the, same, period, members, of, the, frankfurt, school, such, as, theodor, w, adorno, 1903, 1969, and, max, horkheimer, 1895, 1973, developed, critical, theory, integrating, the, historical, materialistic, elements, of, marxism, with, the, insights, of, weber, freud, and, gramsci, in, theory, if, not, always, in, name, often, characterizing, capitalist, modernity, as, a, move, away, from, the, central, tenets, of, the, enlightenment, in, the, 1930s, talcott, parsons, 1902, 1979, aimed, to, bring, together, the, various, strands, of, sociology, with, the, aim, of, developing, a, universal, methodology, he, developed, action, theory, and, functionalism, integrating, the, study, of, social, order, with, the, structural, and, voluntaristic, aspects, of, macro, and, micro, factors, while, placing, the, discussion, within, a, higher, explanatory, context, of, system, theory, and, cybernetics, parsons, had, also, suggested, starting, from, the, bottom, up, rather, than, the, top, down, when, researching, social, order, one, of, his, students, harold, garfinkel, followed, in, this, direction, developing, ethnomethodology, in, austria, and, later, the, u, s, alfred, sch, tz, 1899, 1959, developed, social, phenomenology, which, would, later, inform, social, constructionism, in, some, countries, sociology, was, undermined, by, totalitarian, governments, for, reasons, of, ostensible, political, control, after, the, russian, revolution, sociology, was, gradually, politicized, bolshevisized, and, eventually, stalinized, until, it, virtually, ceased, to, exist, in, the, soviet, union, in, china, the, discipline, was, banned, with, semiotics, comparative, linguistics, and, cybernetics, as, bourgeois, pseudoscience, in, 1952, not, to, return, until, 1979, during, the, same, period, however, sociology, was, also, undermined, by, conservative, universities, in, the, west, this, was, due, in, part, to, perceptions, of, the, subject, as, possessing, an, inherent, tendency, through, its, own, aims, and, remit, toward, liberal, or, left, wing, thought, given, that, the, subject, was, founded, by, structural, functionalists, concerned, with, organic, cohesion, and, social, solidarity, this, view, was, somewhat, groundless, though, it, was, parsons, who, had, introduced, durkheim, to, american, audiences, and, his, interpretation, has, been, criticized, for, a, latent, conservatism, in, the, mid, 20th, century, robert, k, merton, released, his, social, theory, and, social, structure, 1949, around, the, same, time, c, wright, mills, continued, weber, s, work, of, understanding, how, modernity, was, undermining, tradition, with, a, critique, of, the, dehumanizing, impact, this, had, on, people, also, using, the, weberian, notion, of, class, he, found, that, the, united, states, was, at, the, time, ruled, by, a, power, elite, composed, of, military, political, economic, and, union, leaders, his, the, sociological, imagination, 1959, argued, that, the, problem, was, in, people, seeing, their, problems, as, individual, issues, rather, than, as, products, of, social, processes, also, in, 1959, erving, goffman, published, the, presentation, of, self, in, everyday, life, and, introduced, the, theory, of, dramaturgical, analysis, which, asserts, that, all, individuals, aim, to, create, a, specific, impression, of, themselves, in, the, minds, of, other, people, wright, mills, ideas, were, influential, on, the, new, left, of, the, 1960, s, which, he, had, also, coined, the, name, for, herbert, marcuse, was, subsequently, involved, in, the, movement, following, the, counterculture, of, the, decade, new, thinkers, emerged, especially, in, france, such, as, michel, foucault, while, power, had, earlier, been, viewed, either, in, political, or, economic, terms, foucault, argued, that, power, is, everywhere, and, comes, from, everywhere, seeing, it, as, a, type, of, relation, present, on, every, level, of, society, that, is, a, key, component, of, social, order, examples, of, such, relations, included, discourse, and, power, knowledge, foucault, also, studied, human, sexuality, with, his, the, history, of, sexuality, 1976, influenced, by, him, judith, butler, subsequently, pioneered, queer, theory, raewyn, connell, in, turn, identified, the, stigmatization, of, homosexuality, as, a, product, of, hegemonic, masculinity, in, the, 1960, s, sociologists, also, developed, new, types, of, quantitative, and, qualitative, research, methods, paul, lazarsfeld, founded, columbia, university, s, bureau, of, applied, social, research, where, he, exerted, a, tremendous, influence, over, the, techniques, and, the, organization, of, social, research, his, many, contributions, to, sociological, method, have, earned, him, the, title, of, the, founder, of, modern, empirical, sociology, lazarsfeld, made, great, strides, in, statistical, survey, analysis, panel, methods, latent, structure, analysis, and, contextual, analysis, he, is, also, considered, a, co, founder, of, mathematical, sociology, many, of, his, ideas, have, been, so, influential, as, to, now, be, considered, self, evident, in, the, 1970, s, peter, townsend, redefined, poverty, from, the, previous, definition, of, total, earnings, being, too, little, to, obtain, the, minimum, necessities, of, physical, life, to, one, which, also, took, into, account, the, relative, deprivation, caused, meaning, that, not, having, access, to, the, typical, level, of, lifestyle, was, also, a, form, of, poverty, during, the, same, decade, pierre, bourdieu, advancing, the, concept, of, habitus, argued, that, class, was, not, defined, solely, by, economic, means, but, also, by, the, socially, acquired, taste, which, one, shared, with, the, rest, of, the, class, beyond, economic, capital, he, also, identified, cultural, social, scholastic, linguistic, and, political, capital, these, all, contributed, towards, symbolic, capital, richard, sennett, in, turn, found, that, working, class, people, were, finding, themselves, in, crisis, following, rising, social, status, as, it, conflicted, with, the, values, of, their, background, structuralism, is, the, belief, that, phenomena, of, human, life, are, not, intelligible, except, through, their, interrelations, these, relations, constitute, a, structure, and, behind, local, variations, in, the, surface, phenomena, there, are, constant, laws, of, abstract, structure, structuralism, in, europe, developed, in, the, early, 1900s, mainly, in, france, and, russian, empire, in, the, structural, linguistics, of, ferdinand, de, saussure, and, the, subsequent, prague, moscow, and, copenhagen, schools, of, linguistics, in, the, late, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, when, structural, linguistics, were, facing, serious, challenges,

with, a, philosophy, of, social, science, critical, naturalism, it, specifically, opposes, forms, of, empiricism, and, positivism, by, viewing, science, as, concerned, with, identifying, causal, mechanisms, also, in, the, context, of, social, science, it, argues, that, scientific, investigation, can, lead, directly, to, critique, of, social, arrangements, and, institutions, in, a, similar, manner, to, the, work, of, karl, marx, in, the, last, decades, of, the, twentieth, century, it, also, stood, against, various, forms, of, postmodernism, it, is, one, of, a, range, of, types, of,
