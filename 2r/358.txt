b, estimate, for, entire, area, covered, by, modern, sudan, the, funj, sultanate, also, known, as, funjistan, sultanate, of, sennar, after, its, capital, sennar, or, blue, sultanate, due, to, the, traditional, sudanese, convention, of, referring, to, black, people, as, blue, arabic, romanized, al, sul, anah, al, zarq, was, a, monarchy, in, what, is, now, sudan, northwestern, eritrea, and, western, ethiopia, founded, in, 1504, by, the, funj, people, it, quickly, converted, to, islam, although, this, conversion, was, only, nominal, until, a, more, orthodox, form, of, islam, took, hold, in, the, 18th, century, the, state, remained, an, african, empire, with, a, muslim, fa, ade, it, reached, its, peak, in, the, late, 17th, century, but, declined, and, eventually, fell, apart, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, in, 1821, the, last, sultan, greatly, reduced, in, power, surrendered, to, the, ottoman, egyptian, invasion, without, a, fight, christian, nubia, represented, by, the, two, medieval, kingdoms, of, makuria, and, alodia, began, to, decline, from, the, 12th, century, by, 1365, makuria, had, virtually, collapsed, and, was, reduced, to, a, rump, state, restricted, to, lower, nubia, until, finally, disappearing, c, 150, years, later, the, fate, of, alodia, is, less, clear, it, has, been, suggested, that, it, had, collapsed, as, early, as, the, 12th, century, or, shortly, after, as, archaeology, suggests, that, in, this, period, soba, ceased, to, be, used, as, its, capital, by, the, 13th, century, central, sudan, seemed, to, have, disintegrated, into, various, petty, states, between, the, 14th, and, 15th, centuries, sudan, was, overran, by, bedouin, tribes, in, the, 15th, century, one, of, these, bedouins, whom, sudanese, traditions, refer, to, as, abdallah, jammah, is, recorded, to, have, created, a, tribal, federation, and, to, have, subsequently, destroyed, what, was, left, of, alodia, in, the, early, 16th, century, abdallah, s, federation, came, under, attack, from, an, invader, to, the, south, the, funj, the, ethnic, affiliation, of, the, funj, is, still, disputed, the, first, and, second, of, the, three, most, prominent, theories, suggest, that, they, were, either, nubians, or, shilluk, while, according, to, the, third, theory, the, funj, were, not, an, ethnic, group, but, a, social, class, in, the, 14th, century, a, muslim, funj, trader, named, al, hajj, faraj, al, funi, was, involved, in, the, red, sea, trade, according, to, oral, traditions, the, dinka, who, migrated, upstream, the, white, and, blue, nile, since, the, 13th, century, disintegration, of, alodia, came, in, conflict, with, the, funj, who, the, dinka, defeated, in, the, late, 15th, early, 16th, century, the, shilluk, arrived, at, the, junction, of, the, sobat, and, the, white, nile, where, they, encountered, a, sedentary, people, shilluk, traditions, refer, to, as, apfuny, obwongo, and, or, dongo, a, people, now, equated, with, the, funj, said, to, be, more, sophisticated, than, the, shilluk, they, were, defeated, in, a, series, of, brutal, wars, and, either, assimilated, or, pushed, north, anti, funj, propaganda, from, the, later, period, of, the, kingdom, referred, to, the, funj, as, pagans, from, the, white, nile, and, barbarians, who, had, originated, from, the, primitive, southern, swamps, in, 1504, the, funj, defeated, abdallah, jammah, and, founded, the, funj, sultanate, in, 1523, the, kingdom, was, visited, by, jewish, traveller, david, reubeni, who, disguised, himself, as, a, sharif, sultan, amara, dunqas, reubeni, wrote, was, continuously, travelling, through, his, kingdom, he, who, ruled, over, black, people, and, white, between, the, region, south, of, the, nile, confluence, to, as, far, north, as, dongola, owned, large, herds, of, various, types, of, animals, and, commanded, many, captains, on, horseback, two, years, later, ottoman, admiral, selman, reis, mentioned, amara, dunqas, and, his, kingdom, calling, it, weak, and, easily, conquerable, he, also, stated, that, amara, paid, an, annual, tribute, of, 9, 000, camels, to, the, ethiopian, empire, one, year, later, the, ottomans, occupied, sawakin, which, beforehand, was, associated, with, sennar, it, seems, that, to, counter, the, ottoman, expansion, in, the, red, sea, region, the, funj, engaged, in, an, alliance, with, ethiopia, besides, camels, the, funj, are, known, to, have, exported, horses, to, ethiopia, which, were, then, used, in, war, against, the, adal, sultanate, the, borders, of, funj, were, raided, by, ahmed, gurey, during, the, war, taking, many, slaves, before, stopping, near, the, taka, mountain, range, near, modern, day, kassala, before, the, ottomans, gained, a, foothold, in, ethiopia, in, 1555, zdemir, pasha, was, appointed, beylerbey, of, the, yet, to, be, conquered, habesh, eyalet, he, attempted, to, march, upstream, along, the, nile, to, conquer, the, funj, but, his, troops, revolted, when, they, approached, the, first, cataract, of, the, nile, until, 1570, however, the, ottomans, had, established, themselves, in, qasr, ibrim, in, lower, nubia, most, likely, a, preemptive, move, to, secure, upper, egypt, from, funj, aggression, fourteen, years, later, they, had, pushed, as, far, south, as, the, third, cataract, of, the, nile, and, subsequently, attempted, to, conquer, dongola, but, in, 1585, were, crushed, by, the, funj, at, the, battle, of, hannik, afterwards, the, battlefield, which, was, located, just, south, of, the, third, nile, cataract, would, mark, the, border, between, the, two, kingdoms, in, the, late, 16th, century, the, funj, pushed, towards, the, habesh, eyalet, conquering, north, western, eritrea, failing, to, make, progress, against, both, the, funj, sultanate, and, ethiopia, the, ottomans, abandoned, their, policy, of, expansion, thus, from, the, 1590s, onwards, the, ottoman, threat, vanished, rendering, the, funj, ethiopian, alliance, unnecessary, and, relations, between, the, two, states, were, about, to, turn, into, open, hostility, as, late, as, 1597, however, the, relations, were, still, described, as, friendly, with, trade, flourishing, in, the, meantime, the, rule, of, sultan, dakin, 1568, 1585, saw, the, rise, of, ajib, a, minor, king, of, northern, nubia, when, dakin, returned, from, a, failed, campaign, in, the, ethiopian, sudanese, borderlands, ajib, had, acquired, enough, power, to, demand, and, receive, greater, political, autonomy, a, few, years, later, he, forced, sultan, tayyib, to, marry, his, daughter, effectively, making, tayyib, and, his, offspring, and, successor, unsa, his, vassals, unsa, was, eventually, deposed, in, 1603, 1604, by, abd, al, qadir, ii, triggering, ajib, to, invade, the, funj, heartland, his, armies, pushed, the, funj, king, to, the, south, east, thus, ajib, effectively, ruled, over, an, empire, reaching, from, dongola, to, ethiopia, abd, el, qadir, ii, eventually, deposed, in, december, 1606, fled, to, ethiopia, and, submitted, to, emperor, susenyos, providing, susenyos, with, an, opportunity, to, intervene, in, the, sultanate, s, affairs, however, the, new, funj, sultan, adlan, i, managed, to, turn, the, tide, of, war, against, ajib, eventually, killing, him, in, 1611, or, 1612, while, chasing, the, remnants, of, ajib, s, army, to, the, north, adlan, ii, himself, was, deposed, and, succeeded, by, a, son, of, the, former, sultan, abd, al, qadir, ii, badi, i, he, issued, a, peace, treaty, with, the, sons, of, ajib, agreeing, to, factually, split, the, funj, state, the, successors, of, ajib, the, abdallab, would, receive, everything, north, of, the, confluence, of, blue, and, white, nile, which, they, would, rule, as, vassal, kings, of, sennar, therefore, the, funj, lost, direct, control, over, much, of, their, kingdom, in, 1618, 1619, bahr, negash, gebre, mariam, ruler, of, the, medri, bahri, helped, emperor, susneyos, in, a, military, campaign, against, the, sennar, sultanate, emperor, susneyos, sent, bahr, gebre, to, attack, mandara, whose, queen, fatima, controlled, a, strategic, caravan, road, from, suakin, the, bahr, negash, was, successful, in, capturing, queen, fatima, which, he, sent, back, to, emperor, susenyos, palace, in, danqaz, gorgora, and, she, renewed, submission, to, the, ethiopian, empire, the, submission, of, abd, al, qadir, ii, to, the, ethiopian, emperor, and, the, possibility, of, a, consequential, invasion, remained, a, problem, for, the, funj, sultans, adlan, i, had, apparently, been, too, weak, to, do, something, against, this, situation, but, badi, i, was, able, to, take, matters, into, his, own, hands, a, rich, present, by, susenyos, which, he, perhaps, sent, in, the, belief, that, the, successors, of, abd, al, qadir, ii, would, honour, the, submission, of, the, latter, was, rudely, answered, with, two, lame, horses, and, first, raids, of, ethiopian, posts, susenyos, occupied, elsewhere, would, not, respond, to, that, act, of, aggression, until, 1617, when, he, raided, several, funj, provinces, this, mutual, raiding, finally, escalated, into, a, full, fledged, war, in, 1618, and, 1619, resulting, in, the, devastation, of, many, of, the, funj, eastern, provinces, a, pitched, battle, was, also, fought, claimed, by, the, ethiopian, sources, to, have, been, a, victory, albeit, this, is, posed, doubtful, by, the, fact, that, the, ethiopian, troops, retreated, immediately, afterwards, after, the, war, the, two, countries, remained, at, peace, for, over, a, century, the, funj, sultan, who, ruled, during, the, war, rabat, i, was, the, first, in, a, series, of, three, monarchs, under, whom, the, sultanate, entered, a, period, of, prosperity, expansion, and, increased, contacts, with, the, outside, world, but, was, also, confronted, with, several, new, problems, in, the, 17th, century, the, shilluk, and, sennar, were, forced, into, an, uneasy, alliance, to, combat, the, growing, might, of, the, dinka, after, the, alliance, had, run, its, cause, in, 1650, sultan, badi, ii, occupied, the, northern, half, of, the, shilluk, kingdom, under, his, rule, the, funj, defeated, the, kingdom, of, taqali, to, the, west, and, made, its, ruler, his, vassal, sennar, was, at, its, peak, at, the, end, of, the, 17th, century, but, during, the, 18th, century, it, began, to, decline, as, the, power, of, the, monarchy, was, eroded, the, greatest, challenge, to, the, authority, of, the, king, were, the, merchant, funded, ulama, who, insisted, it, was, rightfully, their, duty, to, mete, out, justice, in, about, 1718, the, previous, dynasty, the, unsab, was, overthrown, in, a, coup, and, replaced, by, nul, who, although, related, to, the, previous, sultan, effectively, founded, a, dynasty, on, his, own, in, 1741, and, 1743, the, young, ethiopian, emperor, iyasu, ii, conducted, raids, westwards, attempting, to, acquire, quick, military, fame, in, march, 1744, he, assembled, an, army, of, 30, 000, 100, 000, men, for, a, new, expedition, which, was, initially, intended, as, yet, another, raid, but, soon, turned, into, a, war, of, conquest, on, the, banks, of, the, dinder, river, the, two, states, fought, a, pitched, battle, which, went, in, favour, of, sennar, traveller, james, bruce, noted, that, iyasu, ii, plundered, his, way, back, to, ethiopia, allowing, him, to, display, his, campaign, as, a, success, meanwhile, badi, iv, s, repulsion, of, the, ethiopian, invasion, made, him, a, national, hero, hostilities, between, the, two, states, continued, until, the, end, of, iyasu, ii, s, reign, in, 1755, tensions, caused, by, this, war, were, still, recorded, in, 1773, trade, however, soon, resumed, after, the, conflict, although, on, reduced, scale, it, has, been, suggested, that, it, was, badi, s, victory, over, the, ethiopians, that, strengthened, his, power, in, 1743, 1744, he, is, known, to, have, had, his, vizier, executed, and, to, have, taken, the, reins, he, attempted, to, create, a, new, power, base, by, purging, the, previous, ruling, clan, stripping, the, nobility, of, their, land, and, instead, empowering, clients, from, the, western, and, southern, periphery, of, his, realm, one, of, these, clients, was, muhammad, abu, likayik, a, hamaj, a, generic, sudannese, term, applied, to, the, pre, funj, non, arabic, or, semi, arabized, people, of, the, gezira, and, ethiopian, sudanese, borderlands, from, east, of, fazughli, who, was, granted, land, immediately, south, of, sennar, in, 1747, 1748, he, was, a, cavalry, commander, tasked, to, pacify, kordofan, which, had, become, a, battlefield, between, the, funj, and, the, musabb, at, refugees, from, the, sultanate, of, darfur, the, fur, had, the, upper, hand, until, 1755, when, abu, likayik, finally, managed, to, overrun, kordofan, and, turn, it, into, his, new, powerbase, in, the, meantime, sultan, badi, grew, increasingly, unpopular, due, to, his, repressive, measures, eventually, abu, likayik, was, convinced, by, disaffected, funj, noblemen, many, of, them, residing, in, kordofan, to, march, on, the, capital, in, 1760, 1761, he, reached, alays, at, the, white, nile, where, a, council, was, held, in, which, badi, was, formally, deposed, afterwards, he, besieged, sennar, which, he, entered, on, 27, march, 1762, badi, fled, to, ethiopia, but, was, murdered, in, 1763, thus, began, the, hamaj, regency, where, the, funj, monarchs, became, puppets, of, the, hamaj, abu, likayik, installed, another, member, of, the, royal, family, as, his, puppet, sultan, and, ruled, as, regent, this, began, a, long, conflict, between, the, funj, sultans, attempting, to, reassert, their, independence, and, authority, and, the, hamaj, regents, attempting, to, maintain, control, of, the, true, power, of, the, state, these, internal, divisions, greatly, weakened, the, state, and, in, the, late, 18th, century, mek, adlan, ii, son, of, mek, taifara, took, power, during, a, turbulent, time, at, which, a, turkish, presence, was, being, established, in, the, funj, kingdom, the, turkish, ruler, al, tahir, agha, married, khadeeja, daughter, of, mek, adlan, ii, this, paved, the, way, for, the, assimilation, of, the, funj, into, the, ottoman, empire, the, later, 18th, century, saw, a, rapid, disintegration, of, the, funj, state, in, 1785, 1786, the, fur, sultanate, conquered, kordofan, which, it, managed, to, hold, until, the, egyptian, invasion, of, 1821, in, the, second, half, of, the, 18th, century, sennar, lost, the, tigre, in, what, is, now, eritrea, to, the, rising, naib, deputy, of, massawa, while, after, 1791, taka, around, the, sudanese, mareb, river, made, itself, independent, the, shukriya, became, the, new, dominant, power, in, the, butana, the, long, isolated, province, of, dongola, finally, fell, to, the, shaiqiya, in, around, 1782, who, installed, a, loyal, puppet, dynasty, after, 1802, the, authority, of, the, sultanate, was, limited, to, the, gezira, for, good, in, the, early, years, of, the, 19th, century, the, kingdom, was, plagued, by, excessive, civil, wars, regent, muhammad, adlan, who, rose, to, power, in, 1808, and, whose, father, had, been, assassinated, by, a, warlord, of, that, period, was, able, to, put, an, end, to, these, wars, and, managed, to, stabilize, the, kingdom, for, another, 13, years, in, 1820, ismail, bin, muhammad, ali, the, general, and, son, of, the, nominally, ottoman, vassal, muhammad, ali, pasha, began, the, conquest, of, sudan, realizing, that, the, turks, were, about, to, conquer, his, domain, muhammad, adlan, prepared, to, resist, and, ordered, to, muster, the, army, at, the, nile, confluence, but, he, fell, to, a, plot, near, sennar, in, early, 1821, one, of, the, murderers, a, man, named, daf, allah, rode, back, to, the, capital, to, prepare, sultan, badi, vii, s, submission, ceremony, to, the, turks, the, turks, reached, the, nile, confluence, in, may, 1821, afterwards, they, travelled, upstream, the, blue, nile, until, reaching, sennar, they, were, disappointed, to, learn, that, sennar, once, enjoying, a, reputation, of, wealth, and, splendour, was, now, reduced, to, a, heap, of, ruins, on, 14, june, they, received, the, official, submission, of, badi, vii, the, sultans, of, sennar, were, powerful, but, not, absolutely, so, as, a, council, of, 20, elders, also, had, a, say, in, state, decisions, below, the, king, stood, the, chief, minister, the, amin, and, the, jundi, who, supervised, the, market, and, acted, as, commander, of, the, state, police, and, intelligence, service, another, high, court, official, was, the, sid, al, qum, a, royal, bodyguard, and, executioner, only, he, was, allowed, to, shed, royal, blood, as, he, was, tasked, to, kill, all, brothers, of, a, freshly, elected, king, to, prevent, civil, wars, the, state, was, divided, into, several, provinces, governed, by, a, manjil, each, of, these, province, was, again, divided, into, sub, provinces, governed, by, a, makk, each, of, them, subordinated, to, their, respective, manjil, the, most, important, manjil, was, the, one, of, the, abdallabs, followed, by, alays, at, the, white, nile, the, kings, of, the, blue, nile, region, and, finally, the, rest, the, king, of, sennar, exercised, his, influence, among, the, manjils, forcing, them, to, marry, a, woman, from, the, royal, clan, which, acted, as, royal, spies, a, member, of, the, royal, clan, also, always, sat, at, their, side, observing, their, behaviour, furthermore, the, manjils, had, to, travel, to, sennar, every, year, to, pay, tribute, and, account, for, their, deeds, it, was, under, king, badi, ii, when, sennar, became, the, fixed, capital, of, the, state, and, when, written, documents, concerning, administrative, matters, appeared, with, the, oldest, known, one, dating, to, 1654, the, army, of, sennar, was, feudal, each, noble, house, could, field, a, military, unit, measured, in, its, power, by, its, horsemen, subjects, although, generally, armed, were, only, rarely, called, to, war, in, cases, of, uttermost, need, most, funj, warriors, were, slaves, traditionally, captured, in, annual, slave, raids, called, salatiya, targeting, the, stateless, non, muslims, in, the, nuba, mountains, pejoratively, referred, to, as, fartit, the, army, was, divided, infantry, represented, by, an, official, called, muqaddam, al, qawawid, and, cavalry, represented, by, the, muqaddam, al, khayl, the, sultan, rarely, led, armies, into, battle, and, instead, appointed, a, commander, for, the, duration, of, the, campaign, called, amin, jaysh, al, sultan, nomadic, warriors, fighting, for, the, funj, had, an, own, appointed, leader, the, aqid, or, qa, id, the, weaponry, of, the, funj, warriors, consisted, of, thrusting, lances, throwing, knives, javelins, hide, shields, and, most, importantly, long, broadswords, which, could, be, wielded, with, two, hands, body, armour, consisted, of, leather, or, quilts, and, additionally, mail, while, the, hands, were, protected, by, leather, gloves, on, the, heads, there, were, worn, iron, or, copper, helmets, the, horses, were, also, armoured, wearing, thick, quilts, copper, headgear, and, breast, plates, while, armour, was, also, manufactured, locally, it, was, at, times, imported, as, well, during, the, late, 17th, century, sultan, badi, iii, attempted, to, modernize, the, army, by, importing, firearms, and, even, cannons, but, they, were, quickly, disregarded, after, his, death, not, only, because, the, import, was, expensive, and, unreliable, but, also, because, the, traditionally, armed, elites, feared, for, their, power, in, the, early, 1770s, james, bruce, remarked, that, the, sultan, had, not, one, musket, in, his, whole, army, 40, years, later, johann, ludwig, burckhardt, noted, that, mek, nimr, the, now, independent, lord, of, shendi, maintained, a, small, force, of, slaves, armed, with, muskets, bought, or, stolen, from, egyptian, merchants, while, they, were, in, bad, shape, their, mere, display, was, enough, to, cause, terror, among, nimr, s, enemies, in, 1820, the, shaiqiya, were, said, to, have, a, few, pistols, and, guns, although, the, overwhelming, majority, still, used, traditional, weapons, the, funj, made, use, of, shilluk, and, dinka, mercenaries, by, the, time, of, the, visit, by, david, reubeni, in, 1523, the, funj, originally, pagans, or, syncretic, christians, had, converted, to, islam, they, probably, converted, to, ease, their, rule, over, their, muslim, subjects, and, to, facilitate, trade, with, neighbouring, countries, like, egypt, their, embracement, of, islam, was, only, nominal, and, in, fact, the, funj, effectively, even, delayed, the, islamization, of, nubia, as, they, temporarily, strengthened, african, sacral, traditions, instead, the, monarchy, they, established, was, divine, similar, to, that, of, many, other, african, states, the, funj, sultan, had, hundreds, of, wives, and, spent, most, of, his, reign, within, the, palace, secluded, from, his, subjects, and, maintaining, contact, only, with, a, handful, of, officials, he, was, not, allowed, to, be, seen, eating, on, the, rare, occasion, he, appeared, in, public, he, did, so, only, with, a, veil, and, accompanied, by, much, pomp, the, sultan, was, judged, regularly, and, if, found, wanting, could, be, executed, all, funj, but, especially, the, sultan, were, believed, to, be, able, to, detect, sorcery, islamic, talismans, written, in, sennar, were, believed, to, have, special, powers, due, to, the, proximity, to, the, sultan, among, the, populace, even, the, basics, of, islamic, faith, were, not, widely, known, pork, and, beer, were, consumed, as, staple, food, throughout, much, of, the, kingdom, the, death, of, an, important, individual, would, be, mourned, by, communal, dancing, self, mutilation, and, rolling, in, the, ashes, of, the, feast, fire, at, least, in, some, regions, elderly, crippled, and, others, who, believed, to, be, a, burden, for, their, relatives, and, friends, were, expected, to, request, to, be, buried, alive, or, otherwise, disposed, as, late, as, the, late, 17th, century, the, funj, sultanate, was, still, recorded, to, not, follow, the, laws, of, the, turks, i, e, islam, thus, until, the, 18th, century, islam, was, not, much, more, than, a, facade, despite, this, the, funj, acted, as, sponsors, of, islam, from, the, very, beginning, encouraging, the, settlement, of, muslim, holy, men, in, their, domain, in, the, later, period, civil, wars, forced, the, peasants, to, look, to, the, holy, men, for, protection, the, sultans, lost, the, peasant, population, to, the, ulama, the, collapse, of, the, christian, nubian, states, went, hand, in, hand, with, the, collapse, of, the, christian, institutions, the, christian, faith, however, would, continue, to, exist, although, gradually, declining, by, the, sixteenth, century, large, portions, of, nubia, s, population, would, still, have, been, christian, dongola, the, former, capital, and, christian, center, of, the, makurian, kingdom, was, recorded, to, have, been, largely, islamized, by, the, turn, of, the, 16th, century, although, a, franciscan, letter, confirms, the, existence, of, a, community, immediately, south, of, dongola, practicing, a, debased, christianity, as, late, as, 1742, according, to, the, 1699, account, of, poncet, muslims, reacted, to, meeting, christians, in, the, streets, of, sennar, by, reciting, the, shahada, the, fazughli, region, seems, to, have, been, christian, at, least, for, one, generation, after, its, conquest, in, 1685, a, christian, principality, was, mentioned, in, the, region, as, late, as, 1773,
