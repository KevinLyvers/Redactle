fertile, crescent, europe, africa, siberia, the, middle, paleolithic, or, middle, palaeolithic, is, the, second, subdivision, of, the, paleolithic, or, old, stone, age, as, it, is, understood, in, europe, africa, and, asia, the, term, middle, stone, age, is, used, as, an, equivalent, or, a, synonym, for, the, middle, paleolithic, in, african, archeology, the, middle, paleolithic, broadly, spanned, from, 300, 000, to, 50, 000, years, ago, there, are, considerable, dating, differences, between, regions, the, middle, paleolithic, was, succeeded, by, the, upper, paleolithic, subdivision, which, first, began, between, 50, 000, and, 40, 000, years, ago, pettit, and, white, date, the, early, middle, paleolithic, in, great, britain, to, about, 325, 000, to, 180, 000, years, ago, late, marine, isotope, stage, 9, to, late, marine, isotope, stage, 7, and, the, late, middle, paleolithic, as, about, 60, 000, to, 35, 000, years, ago, the, middle, paleolithic, was, in, the, geological, chibanian, middle, pleistocene, and, late, pleistocene, ages, according, to, the, theory, of, the, recent, african, origin, of, modern, humans, anatomically, modern, humans, began, migrating, out, of, africa, during, the, middle, stone, age, middle, paleolithic, around, 125, 000, years, ago, and, began, to, replace, earlier, pre, existent, homo, species, such, as, the, neanderthals, and, homo, erectus, the, earliest, evidence, of, behavioral, modernity, first, appears, during, the, middle, paleolithic, undisputed, evidence, of, behavioral, modernity, however, only, becomes, common, during, the, following, upper, paleolithic, period, middle, paleolithic, burials, at, sites, such, as, krapina, in, croatia, dated, to, c, 130, 000, bp, and, the, qafzeh, and, es, skhul, caves, in, israel, c, 100, 000, bp, have, led, some, anthropologists, and, archeologists, such, as, philip, lieberman, to, believe, that, middle, paleolithic, cultures, may, have, possessed, a, developing, religious, ideology, which, included, concepts, such, as, an, afterlife, other, scholars, suggest, the, bodies, were, buried, for, secular, reasons, according, to, recent, archeological, findings, from, homo, heidelbergensis, sites, in, the, atapuerca, mountains, the, practice, of, intentional, burial, may, have, begun, much, earlier, during, the, late, lower, paleolithic, but, this, theory, is, widely, questioned, in, the, scientific, community, cut, marks, on, neandertal, bones, from, various, sites, such, as, combe, grenal, and, the, moula, rock, shelter, in, france, may, imply, that, neanderthals, like, some, contemporary, human, cultures, may, have, practiced, excarnation, for, presumably, religious, reasons, see, neanderthal, behavior, cannibalism, or, ritual, defleshing, the, earliest, undisputed, evidence, of, artistic, expression, during, the, paleolithic, period, comes, from, middle, paleolithic, middle, stone, age, sites, such, as, blombos, cave, in, the, form, of, bracelets, beads, art, rock, ochre, used, as, body, paint, and, perhaps, in, ritual, though, earlier, examples, of, artistic, expression, such, as, the, venus, of, tan, tan, and, the, patterns, found, on, elephant, bones, from, bilzingsleben, in, thuringia, may, have, been, produced, by, acheulean, tool, users, such, as, homo, erectus, prior, to, the, start, of, the, middle, paleolithic, period, activities, such, as, catching, large, fish, and, hunting, large, game, animals, with, specialized, tools, indicate, increased, group, wide, cooperation, and, more, elaborate, social, organization, in, addition, to, developing, advanced, cultural, traits, humans, also, first, began, to, take, part, in, long, distance, trade, between, groups, for, rare, commodities, such, as, ochre, which, was, often, used, for, religious, purposes, such, as, ritual, and, raw, materials, during, the, middle, paleolithic, as, early, as, 120, 000, years, ago, inter, group, trade, may, have, appeared, during, the, middle, paleolithic, because, trade, between, bands, would, have, helped, ensure, their, survival, by, allowing, them, to, exchange, resources, and, commodities, such, as, raw, materials, during, times, of, relative, scarcity, i, e, famine, or, drought, evidence, from, archeology, and, comparative, ethnography, indicates, that, middle, paleolithic, people, lived, in, small, egalitarian, band, societies, similar, to, those, of, upper, paleolithic, societies, and, some, modern, hunter, gatherers, such, as, the, kung, and, mbuti, peoples, both, neanderthal, and, modern, human, societies, took, care, of, the, elderly, members, of, their, societies, during, the, middle, paleolithic, christopher, boehm, 1999, has, hypothesized, that, egalitarianism, may, have, arisen, in, middle, paleolithic, societies, because, of, a, need, to, distribute, resources, such, as, food, and, meat, equally, to, avoid, famine, and, ensure, a, stable, food, supply, it, has, usually, been, assumed, that, women, gathered, plants, and, firewood, and, men, hunted, and, scavenged, dead, animals, through, the, paleolithic, however, steven, l, kuhn, and, mary, stiner, from, the, university, of, arizona, suggest, that, this, sex, based, division, of, labor, did, not, exist, prior, to, the, upper, paleolithic, the, sexual, division, of, labor, may, have, evolved, after, 45, 000, years, ago, to, allow, humans, to, acquire, food, and, other, resources, more, efficiently, although, gathering, and, hunting, comprised, most, of, the, food, supply, during, the, middle, paleolithic, people, began, to, supplement, their, diet, with, seafood, and, began, smoking, and, drying, meat, to, preserve, and, store, it, for, instance, the, middle, stone, age, inhabitants, of, the, region, now, occupied, by, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, hunted, large, 1, 8, metre, 6, ft, long, catfish, with, specialized, barbed, fishing, points, as, early, as, 90, 000, years, ago, and, neandertals, and, middle, paleolithic, homo, sapiens, in, africa, began, to, catch, shellfish, for, food, as, revealed, by, shellfish, cooking, in, neanderthal, sites, in, italy, about, 110, 000, years, ago, and, middle, paleolithic, homo, sapiens, sites, at, pinnacle, point, in, africa, anthropologists, such, as, tim, d, white, suggest, that, cannibalism, was, common, in, human, societies, prior, to, the, beginning, of, the, upper, paleolithic, based, on, the, large, amount, of, butchered, human, bones, found, in, neandertal, and, other, middle, paleolithic, sites, cannibalism, in, the, middle, paleolithic, may, have, occurred, because, of, food, shortages, however, it, is, also, possible, that, middle, paleolithic, cannibalism, occurred, for, religious, reasons, which, would, coincide, with, the, development, of, religious, practices, thought, to, have, occurred, during, the, upper, paleolithic, nonetheless, it, remains, possible, that, middle, paleolithic, societies, never, practiced, cannibalism, and, that, the, damage, to, recovered, human, bones, was, either, the, result, of, excarnation, or, predation, by, carnivores, such, as, saber, toothed, cats, lions, and, hyenas, around, 200, 000, bp, middle, paleolithic, stone, tool, manufacturing, spawned, a, tool, making, technique, known, as, the, prepared, core, technique, that, was, more, elaborate, than, previous, acheulean, techniques, wallace, and, shea, split, the, core, artifacts, into, two, different, types, formal, cores, and, expedient, cores, formal, cores, are, designed, to, extract, the, maximum, amount, from, the, raw, material, while, expedient, cores, are, based, more, upon, functional, need, this, method, increased, efficiency, by, permitting, the, creation, of, more, controlled, and, consistent, flakes, this, method, allowed, middle, paleolithic, humans, correspondingly, to, create, stone, tipped, spears, which, were, the, earliest, composite, tools, by, hafting, sharp, pointy, stone, flakes, onto, wooden, shafts, paleolithic, groups, such, as, the, neanderthals, who, possessed, a, middle, paleolithic, level, of, technology, appear, to, have, hunted, large, game, just, as, well, as, upper, paleolithic, modern, humans, and, the, neanderthals, in, particular, may, have, likewise, hunted, with, projectile, weapons, nonetheless, neanderthal, usage, of, projectile, weapons, in, hunting, occurred, very, rarely, or, perhaps, never, and, the, neanderthals, hunted, large, game, animals, mostly, by, ambushing, them, and, attacking, them, with, m, l, e, weapons, such, as, thrusting, spears, rather, than, attacking, them, from, a, distance, with, projectile, weapons, an, ongoing, controversy, about, the, nature, of, middle, paleolithic, tools, is, whether, there, were, a, series, of, functionally, specific, and, preconceived, tool, forms, or, whether, there, was, a, simple, continuum, of, tool, morphology, that, reflect, the, extent, of, edge, maintenance, as, harold, l, dibble, has, suggested, the, use, of, fire, became, widespread, for, the, first, time, in, human, prehistory, during, the, middle, paleolithic, and, humans, began, to, cook, their, food, c, 250, 000, years, ago, some, scientists, have, hypothesized, that, hominids, began, cooking, food, to, defrost, frozen, meat, which, would, help, ensure, their, survival, in, cold, regions, robert, k, wayne, a, molecular, biologist, has, controversially, claimed, based, on, a, comparison, of, canine, dna, that, dogs, may, have, been, first, domesticated, during, the, middle, paleolithic, around, or, even, before, 100, 000, bce
