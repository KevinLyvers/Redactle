the, deportation, of, the, crimean, tatars, was, declared, as, genocide, by, ukraine, and, three, other, countries, whereas, the, deportation, of, the, chechens, and, ingush, was, declared, as,

the, region, were, deported, by, the, soviet, regime, according, to, polish, historians, 63, 1, of, these, people, were, poles, and, 7, 4, of, them, were, jews, previously, it, was, believed, that, about, 1, 0, million, polish, citizens, died, at, the, hands, of, the, soviets, but, recently, polish, historians, mostly, based, upon, their, study, of, soviet, archives, estimate, that, about, 350, 000, people, who, were, deported, from, 1939, 1945, died, the, same, policy, was, implemented, in, the, baltic, republics, of, latvia, lithuania, and, estonia, see, soviet, deportations, from,

estonia, the, figure, was, 62, in, lithuania, the, situation, was, better, because, the, migrants, sent, to, that, country, actually, moved, to, the, former, area, of, eastern, prussia, now, kaliningrad, which, contrary, to, the, original, plans, never, became, part, of, lithuania, likewise, romanians, from, chernivtsi, oblast, and, moldavia, had, been, deported, in, great, numbers,

of, the, entire, population, served, in, german, battalions, though, the, figure, in, question, is, derived, from, a, single, ss, report, on, how, many, individuals, were, expected, to, be, willing, to, collaborate, and, is, contradicted, by, official, statistical, records, which, suggest, the, number, was, actually, around, 3, 000, with, only, 800, being, volunteers, consequently, tatars, too, were, transferred, en, masse, by, the, soviets, after, the, war, vyacheslav, molotov, justified, this, decision, saying, the, fact, is, that, during, the, war, we, received, reports, about, mass,

almost, paternalistic, policy, the, karachai, balkars, ingush, chechen, kalmucks, and, tatars, of, the, crimea, all, displayed, pro, german, sympathies, in, some, degree, it, was, only, the, hurried, withdrawal, of, the, germans, from, the, caucasus, after, the, battle, of, stalingrad, that, prevented, their, organizing, the, moslem, people, for, effective, anti, soviet, action, the, germans,

combined, with, its, resettlement, policies, should, count, as, genocidal, since, the, sentences, were, borne, most, heavily, specifically, on, certain, ethnic, groups, and, that, a, relocation, of, these, ethnic, groups, whose, survival, depended, on, ties, to, their, particular, homeland, had, a, genocidal, effect, remediable, only, by, restoration, of, the, group, to, its, homeland, soviet, dissidents, ilya, gabay, and, pyotr, grigorenko, both, classified, the, population, transfers, of, the, crimean, tatars, as, genocide, historian, timothy, snyder, included, it, in, a, list, of, soviet, policies, that, meet, the, standard, of, genocide, french, historian, and, expert, on, communist, studies, nicolas, werth, german, historian, philipp, ther, professor, anthony, james, joes, american, journalist, eric, margolis, canadian, political, scientist, adam, jones, professor, of, islamic, history, at, the, university, of, massachusetts, dartmouth, brian, glyn, williams, scholars, michael, fredholm, and, fanny, e, bryan, also, considered, the, population, transfers, of, the, chechens, and, ingush, as, the, crime, of, genocide, german, investigative, journalist, lutz, kleveman, compared, the, deportations, of, chechens, and, ingush, to, a, slow, genocide, on, 12, december, 2015, the, ukrainian, parliament, issued, a, resolution, recognizing, the, deportation, of, crimean, tatars, as, genocide, and, established, 18, may, as, the, day, of, remembrance, for, the, victims, of, the, crimean, tatar, genocide, the, parliament, of, latvia, recognized, the, event, as, an, act, of, genocide, on, 9, may, 2019, the, parliament, of, lithuania, did, the, same, on, 6, june, 2019, canadian, parliament, passed, a, motion, on, 10, june, 2019, recognizing, the, crimean, tatar, deportation, of, 1944, s, rg, nlik, as, a, genocide, perpetrated, by, soviet, dictator, stalin, designating, 18, may, to, be, a, day, of, remembrance, the, deportation, of, chechens, and, ingush, was, acknowledged, by, the, european, parliament, as, an, act, of, genocide, in, 2004, believes, that, the, deportation, of, the, entire, chechen, people, to, central, asia, on, 23, february, 1944, on, the, orders, of, stalin, constitutes, an, act, of, genocide, within, the, meaning, of, the, fourth, hague, convention, of, 1907, and, the, convention, for, the, prevention, and, repression, of, the, crime, of, genocide, adopted, by, the, un, general, assembly, on, 9, december, 1948, experts, of, the, united, states, holocaust, memorial, museum, cited, the, events, of, 1944, for, a, reason, of, placing, chechnya, on, their, genocide, watch, list, for, its, potential, for, genocide, the, separatist, government, of, chechnya, also, recognized, it, as, genocide, some, academics, disagree, with, the, classification, of, deportation, as, genocide, professor, alexander, statiev, argues, that, stalin, s, administration, did, not, have, a, conscious, genocidal, intent, to, exterminate, the, various, deported, peoples, but, that, soviet, political, culture, poor, planning, haste, and, wartime, shortages, were, responsible, for, the, genocidal, death, rate, among, them, he, rather, considers, these, deportations, an, example, of, soviet, assimilation, of, unwanted, nations, according, to, professor, amir, weiner, it, was, their, territorial, identity, and, not, their, physical, existence, or, even, their, distinct, ethnic, identity, that, the, regime, sought, to, eradicate, according, to, professor, francine, hirsch, although, the, soviet, regime, practiced, politics, of, discrimination, and, exclusion, it, did, not, practice, what, contemporaries, thought, of, as, racial, politics, to, her, these, mass, deportations, were, based, on, the, concept, that, nationalities, were, sociohistorical, groups, with, a, shared, consciousness, and, not, racial, biological, groups, in, contrast, to, this, view, jon, k, chang, contends, that, the, deportations, had, been, in, fact, based, on, ethnicity, and, that, social, historians, in, the, west, have, failed, to, champion, the, rights, of, marginalized, ethnicities, in, the, soviet, union, harvard, s, terry, martin, suggested, a, concept, of, soviet, xenophobia, which, he, defines, as, the, ideologically, motivated, exaggerated, soviet, fear, of, foreign, influence, and, foreign, contamination, this, theory, espouses, the, belief, that, the, soviet, union, ethnically, cleansed, the, border, peoples, of, the, ussr, from, 1937, to, 1951, including, the, caucasus, and, the, crimea, to, remove, soviet, nationalities, whose, political, allegiances, were, allegedly, suspect, or, inimical, to, soviet, socialism, in, this, view, the, ussr, did, not, practice, direct, negative, ethnic, animus, or, discrimination, in, neither, case, did, the, soviet, state, itself, conceive, of, these, deportations, as, ethnic, political, ideology, of, all, soviet, peoples, was, the, primary, consideration, martin, stated, that, the, various, deportations, of, the, soviet, border, peoples, were, simply, the, culmination, of, a, gradual, shift, from, predominantly, class, based, terror, which, began, during, collectivization, 1932, 33, to, national, ethnic, based, terror, 1937, accordingly, martin, further, claimed, that, the, nationalities, deportations, were, ideological, not, ethnic, it, was, spurred, by, an, ideological, hatred, and, suspicion, of, foreign, capitalist, governments, not, the, national, hatred, of, non, russians, his, theory, entitled, soviet, xenophobia, paints, the, ussr, and, the, stalinist, regime, as, having, practiced, and, carried, out, in, politics, education, and, soviet, society, relatively, pure, socialism, and, marxist, practices, this, view, has, been, supported, by, many, of, the, major, historians, of, the, ussr, those, in, russian, and, even, korean, studies, such, as, fitzpatrick, suny, f, hirsch, a, weiner, and, a, park, a, park, in, her, archival, work, found, very, little, evidence, that, koreans, had, proven, or, were, able, to, prove, their, loyalties, beyond, a, shadow, of, a, doubt, thus, necessitating, deportation, from, the, border, areas, robert, conquest, stated, that, these, nationalities, were, transferred, because, in, stalin, s, view, either, welcomed, or, not, opposed, the, germans, in, contrast, the, views, of, j, otto, pohl, and, jon, k, chang, affirm, that, the, soviet, union, its, officials, and, everyday, citizens, produced, and, reproduced, from, the, tsarist, era, racialized, primordialist, views, policies, and, tropes, regarding, their, non, slavic, peoples, norman, m, naimark, believed, that, the, stalinist, nationalities, deportations, were, forms, of, national, cultural, genocide, the, deportations, at, the, very, least, changed, the, cultures, way, of, life, and, world, views, of, the, deported, peoples, as, the, majority, were, sent, to, soviet, central, asia, and, siberia, primordialism, is, simply, another, way, of, saying, ethnic, chauvinism, or, racism, because, the, said, primordial, peoples, or, ethnic, groups, are, seen, as, possessing, permanent, traits, and, characteristics, which, they, pass, on, one, generation, to, the, next, both, chang, and, martin, agree, that, the, stalinist, regime, took, a, turn, towards, primordializing, nationality, in, the, 1930s, after, the, primordialist, turn, by, the, stalinist, regime, in, the, mid, 1930s, the, soviet, greeks, finns, poles, chinese, koreans, germans, crimean, tatars, and, the, other, deported, peoples, were, seen, to, have, loyalties, to, their, titular, nations, or, to, non, soviet, polities, as, the, soviet, state, in, the, 1930s, regarded, nationality, ethnicity, and, political, loyalty, ideology, as, a, primordial, equivalents, thus, it, was, no, surprise, that, the, regime, would, choose, deportation, martin, s, different, interpretation, is, that, the, soviet, regime, was, not, deporting, the, various, diaspora, peoples, because, of, their, nationality, rather, nationality, ethnicity, or, phenotype, served, as, a, referent, or, a, signifier, for, the, political, ideology, of, the, deported, peoples, amir, weiner, s, argument, is, similar, to, martin, s, substituting, territorial, identity, for, martin, s, xenophobia, the, soviet, xenophobia, argument, also, does, not, hold, up, semantically, xenophobia, is, the, fear, by, natives, of, invasion, or, loss, of, territory, and, influence, to, foreigners, the, russians, and, other, eastern, slavs, are, coming, into, the, territory, of, the, natives, the, deported, peoples, who, were, simply, soviet, national, minorities, they, were, not, foreign, elements, the, russian, empire, was, not, the, native, state, polity, or, government, in, the, asian, far, east, the, caucasus, and, many, other, regions, of, the, deported, peoples, koguryo, followed, by, parhae, balhae, bohai, were, the, first, states, of, the, russian, far, east, john, j, stephan, called, the, erasure, of, chinese, and, korean, history, state, formation, cultural, contributions, peoples, to, the, region, by, the, ussr, and, russia, the, intentional, genesis, of, a, blank, spot, chang, notes, that, all, forms, of, racism, could, be, explained, away, in, a, like, manner, regardless, all, of, the, stalinist, orders, for, total, deportation, of, the, thirteen, nationalities, from, 1937, to, 1951, list, each, of, the, peoples, by, ethnicity, as, well, as, a, charge, of, treason, soviet, law, required, that, one, s, guilt, or, innocence, for, treason, be, determined, individually, and, in, a, court, of, law, prior, to, sentencing, per, 1936, constitution, finally, on, the, other, end, of, the, primordial, spectrum, the, eastern, slavs, russians, ukrainians, belarusians, were, seen, as, inherently, more, loyal, and, more, representative, of, the, soviet, people, this, is, clearly, a, deviation, from, socialism, and, marxist, leninism, the, number, of, deaths, attributed, to, deported, people, living, in, exile, is, considerable, the, causes, for, such, demographic, catastrophe, lie, in, harsh, climates, of, siberia, and, kazakhstan, disease, malnutrition, work, exploitation, which, lasted, for, up, to, 12, hours, daily, as, well, as, the, lack, of, any, kind, of, appropriate, housing, or, accommodation, for, the, deported, people, overall, it, is, assumed, that, the, fatalities, caused, by, this, relocation, upheaval, range, from, 800, 000, up, to, 1, 500, 000, the, partial, documentation, in, the, nkvd, archives, indicated, that, the, mortality, rates, of, these, deported, ethnic, groups, were, considerable, the, meskhetian, turks, had, a, 14, 6, mortality, rate, the, kalmyks, 17, 4, people, from, crimea, 19, 6, while, the, chechens, the, ingush, and, other, people, from, the, northern, caucasus, had, the, highest, losses, reaching, 23, 7, the, nkvd, did, not, record, excess, deaths, for, the, deported, soviet, koreans, but, their, mortality, rate, estimates, range, from, 10, to, 16, 3, additionally, around, 300, 000, 360, 000, germans, deported, after, world, war, ii, from, occupied, territories, in, eastern, europe, perished, but, the, soviet, army, was, not, the, sole, perpetrator, of, these, expulsions, since, other, european, countries, also, participated, kazakhstan, uzbekistan, desire, to, re, unify, with, armenia, and, or, obtain, more, autonomy, from, the, azeri, ssr
