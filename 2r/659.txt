linguistics, is, the, scientific, study, of, language, involving, analysis, of, language, form, language, meaning, and, language, in, context, language, use, was, first, systematically, documented, in, mesopotamia, with, extant, lexical, lists, of, the, 3rd, to, the, 2nd, millennia, bce, offering, glossaries, on, sumerian, cuneiform, usage, and, meaning, and, phonetical, vocabularies, of, foreign, languages, later, sanskrit, would, be, systematically, analysed, and, its, rules, described, by, p, ini, fl, 6, 4th, century, bce, in, the, indus, valley, beginning, around, the, 4th, century, bce, warring, states, period, china, also, developed, its, own, grammatical, traditions, aristotle, laid, the, foundation, of, western, linguistics, as, part, of, the, study, of, rhetoric, in, his, poetics, c, 335, bc, traditions, of, arabic, grammar, and, hebrew, grammar, developed, during, the, middle, ages, in, a, religious, context, like, p, nini, s, sanskrit, grammar, modern, approaches, began, to, develop, in, the, 18th, century, eventually, being, regarded, in, the, 19th, century, as, belonging, to, the, disciplines, of, psychology, or, biology, with, such, views, establishing, the, foundation, of, mainstream, anglo, american, linguistics, although, in, england, philological, approaches, such, as, that, of, henry, sweet, tended, to, predominate, this, was, contested, in, the, early, 20th, century, by, ferdinand, de, saussure, who, established, linguistics, as, an, autonomous, discipline, within, social, sciences, following, saussure, s, concept, general, linguistics, consists, of, the, study, of, language, as, a, semiotic, system, which, includes, the, subfields, of, phonology, morphology, syntax, and, semantics, each, of, these, subfields, can, be, approached, either, synchronically, or, diachronicially, today, linguistics, encompasses, a, large, number, of, scientific, approaches, and, has, developed, still, more, subfields, including, applied, linguistics, psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, and, computational, linguistics, across, cultures, the, early, history, of, linguistics, is, associated, with, a, need, to, disambiguate, discourse, especially, for, ritual, texts, or, arguments, this, often, led, to, explorations, of, sound, meaning, mappings, and, the, debate, over, conventional, versus, naturalistic, origins, for, these, symbols, finally, this, led, to, the, processes, by, which, larger, structures, are, formed, from, units, the, earliest, linguistic, texts, written, in, cuneiform, on, clay, tablets, date, almost, four, thousand, years, before, the, present, in, the, early, centuries, of, the, second, millennium, bce, in, southern, mesopotamia, there, arose, a, grammatical, tradition, that, lasted, more, than, 2, 500, years, the, linguistic, texts, from, the, earliest, parts, of, the, tradition, were, lists, of, nouns, in, sumerian, a, language, isolate, that, is, a, language, with, no, known, genetic, relatives, the, language, of, religious, and, legal, texts, at, the, time, sumerian, was, being, replaced, in, everyday, speech, by, a, very, different, and, unrelated, language, akkadian, it, remained, however, as, a, language, of, prestige, and, continued, to, be, used, in, religious, and, legal, contexts, it, therefore, had, to, be, taught, as, a, foreign, language, and, to, facilitate, this, information, about, sumerian, was, recorded, in, writing, by, akkadian, speaking, scribes, over, the, centuries, the, lists, became, standardised, and, the, sumerian, words, were, provided, with, akkadian, translations, ultimately, texts, emerged, that, gave, akkadian, equivalents, for, not, just, single, words, but, for, entire, paradigms, of, varying, forms, for, words, one, text, for, instance, has, 227, different, forms, of, the, verb, ar, to, place, linguistics, in, ancient, india, derives, its, impetus, from, the, need, to, correctly, recite, and, interpret, the, vedic, texts, already, in, the, oldest, indian, text, the, rigveda, v, k, speech, is, deified, by, 1200, bce, the, oral, performance, of, these, texts, becomes, standardized, and, treatises, on, ritual, recitation, suggest, splitting, up, the, sanskrit, compounds, into, words, stems, and, phonetic, units, providing, an, impetus, for, morphology, and, phonetics, some, of, the, earliest, activities, in, the, description, of, language, have, been, attributed, to, the, indian, grammarian, p, ini, 6th, century, bce, who, wrote, a, rule, based, description, of, the, sanskrit, language, in, his, a, dhy, y, over, the, next, few, centuries, clarity, was, reached, in, the, organization, of, sound, units, and, the, stop, consonants, were, organized, in, a, 5x5, square, c, 800, bce, pratisakhyas, eventually, leading, to, a, systematic, alphabet, br, hm, by, the, 3rd, century, bce, in, semantics, the, early, sanskrit, grammarian, ka, yana, before, c, 500, bce, proposes, that, verbs, represent, ontologically, prior, categories, and, that, all, nouns, are, etymologically, derived, from, actions, the, etymologist, y, ska, c, 5th, century, bce, posits, that, meaning, inheres, in, the, sentence, and, that, word, meanings, are, derived, based, on, sentential, usage, he, also, provides, four, categories, of, words, nouns, verbs, pre, verbs, and, particles, invariants, and, a, test, for, nouns, both, concrete, and, abstract, words, which, can, be, indicated, by, the, pronoun, that, p, ini, c, 6th, century, bce, opposes, the, y, ska, view, that, sentences, are, primary, and, proposes, a, grammar, for, composing, semantics, from, morphemic, roots, transcending, the, ritual, text, to, consider, living, language, p, ini, specifies, a, comprehensive, set, of, about, 4, 000, aphoristic, rules, sutras, that, in, addition, the, p, inian, school, also, provides, a, list, of, 2000, verb, roots, which, form, the, objects, on, which, these, rules, are, applied, a, list, of, sounds, the, so, called, shiva, sutras, and, a, list, of, 260, words, not, derivable, by, the, rules, the, extremely, succinct, specification, of, these, rules, and, their, complex, interactions, led, to, considerable, commentary, and, extrapolation, over, the, following, centuries, the, phonological, structure, includes, defining, a, notion, of, sound, universals, similar, to, the, modern, phoneme, the, systematization, of, consonants, based, on, oral, cavity, constriction, and, vowels, based, on, height, and, duration, however, it, is, the, ambition, of, mapping, these, from, morpheme, to, semantics, that, is, truly, remarkable, in, modern, terms, grammarians, following, p, ini, include, k, ty, yana, c, 3rd, century, bce, who, wrote, aphorisms, on, p, ini, the, varttika, and, advanced, mathematics, pata, jali, 2nd, century, bce, known, for, his, commentary, on, selected, topics, in, p, ini, s, grammar, the, mahabhasya, and, on, k, ty, yana, s, aphorisms, as, well, as, according, to, some, the, author, of, the, yoga, sutras, and, pingala, with, his, mathematical, approach, to, prosody, several, debates, ranged, over, centuries, for, example, on, whether, word, meaning, mappings, were, conventional, vaisheshika, nyaya, or, eternal, k, ty, yana, pata, jali, m, m, s, the, nyaya, sutras, specified, three, types, of, meaning, the, individual, this, cow, the, type, universal, cowhood, and, the, image, draw, the, cow, that, the, sound, of, a, word, also, forms, a, class, sound, universal, was, observed, by, bhart, hari, c, 500, ce, who, also, posits, that, language, universals, are, the, units, of, thought, close, to, the, nominalist, or, even, the, linguistic, determinism, position, bhart, hari, also, considers, the, sentence, to, be, ontologically, primary, word, meanings, are, learned, given, their, sentential, use, of, the, six, canonical, texts, or, vedangas, that, formed, the, core, syllabus, in, brahminic, education, from, the, 1st, century, ce, until, the, 18th, century, four, dealt, with, language, bhartrihari, around, 500, ce, introduced, a, philosophy, of, meaning, with, his, spho, a, doctrine, p, ini, s, rule, based, method, of, linguistic, analysis, and, description, has, remained, relatively, unknown, to, western, linguistics, until, more, recently, franz, bopp, used, p, ini, s, work, as, a, linguistic, source, for, his, 1807, sanskrit, grammar, but, disregarded, his, methodology, p, ini, s, system, also, differs, from, modern, formal, linguistics, in, that, since, sanskrit, is, a, free, word, order, language, it, did, not, provide, syntactic, rules, formal, linguistics, as, first, proposed, by, louis, hjelmslev, in, 1943, is, nonetheless, based, on, the, same, concept, that, the, expression, of, meaning, is, organised, on, different, layers, of, linguistic, form, including, phonology, and, morphology, the, pali, grammar, of, kacchayana, dated, to, the, early, centuries, ce, describes, the, language, of, the, buddhist, canon, the, greeks, developed, an, alphabet, using, symbols, from, the, phoenicians, adding, signs, for, vowels, and, for, extra, consonants, appropriate, to, their, idiom, see, robins, 1997, in, the, phoenicians, and, in, earlier, greek, writing, systems, such, as, linear, b, graphemes, indicated, syllables, that, is, sound, combinations, of, a, consonant, and, a, vowel, the, addition, of, vowels, by, the, greeks, was, a, major, breakthrough, as, it, facilitated, the, writing, of, greek, by, representing, both, vowels, and, consonants, with, distinct, graphemes, as, a, result, of, the, introduction, of, writing, poetry, such, as, the, homeric, poems, became, written, and, several, editions, were, created, and, commented, on, forming, the, basis, of, philology, and, criticism, along, with, written, speech, the, greeks, commenced, studying, grammatical, and, philosophical, issues, a, philosophical, discussion, about, the, nature, and, origins, of, language, can, be, found, as, early, as, the, works, of, plato, a, subject, of, concern, was, whether, language, was, man, made, a, social, artifact, or, supernatural, in, origin, plato, in, his, cratylus, presents, the, naturalistic, view, that, word, meanings, emerge, from, a, natural, process, independent, of, the, language, user, his, arguments, are, partly, based, on, examples, of, compounding, where, the, meaning, of, the, whole, is, usually, related, to, the, constituents, although, by, the, end, he, admits, a, small, role, for, convention, the, sophists, and, socrates, introduced, dialectics, as, a, new, text, genre, the, platonic, dialogs, contain, definitions, of, the, meters, of, the, poems, and, tragedy, the, form, and, the, structure, of, those, texts, see, the, republic, and, phaidros, ion, etc, aristotle, supports, the, conventional, origins, of, meaning, he, defined, the, logic, of, speech, and, of, the, argument, furthermore, aristotle, s, works, on, rhetoric, and, poetics, became, of, the, utmost, importance, for, the, understanding, of, tragedy, poetry, public, discussions, etc, as, text, genres, aristotle, s, work, on, logic, interrelates, with, his, special, interest, in, language, and, his, work, on, this, area, was, fundamentally, important, for, the, development, of, the, study, of, language, logos, in, greek, means, both, language, and, logic, reasoning, in, categories, aristotle, defines, what, is, meant, by, synonymous, or, univocal, words, what, is, meant, by, homonymous, or, equivocal, words, and, what, is, meant, by, paronymous, or, denominative, words, he, divides, forms, of, speech, as, being, next, he, distinguishes, between, a, subject, of, predication, namely, that, of, which, anything, is, affirmed, or, denied, and, a, subject, of, inhesion, a, thing, is, said, to, be, inherent, in, a, subject, when, though, it, is, not, a, part, of, the, subject, it, cannot, possibly, exist, without, the, subject, e, g, shape, in, a, thing, having, a, shape, the, categories, are, not, abstract, platonic, entities, but, are, found, in, speech, these, are, substance, quantity, quality, relation, place, time, position, state, action, and, affection, in, de, interpretatione, aristotle, analyzes, categoric, propositions, and, draws, a, series, of, basic, conclusions, on, the, routine, issues, of, classifying, and, defining, basic, linguistic, forms, such, as, simple, terms, and, propositions, nouns, and, verbs, negation, the, quantity, of, simple, propositions, primitive, roots, of, the, quantifiers, in, modern, symbolic, logic, investigations, on, the, excluded, middle, which, to, aristotle, isn, t, applicable, to, future, tense, propositions, the, problem, of, future, contingents, and, on, modal, propositions, the, stoics, made, linguistics, an, important, part, of, their, system, of, the, cosmos, and, the, human, they, played, an, important, role, in, defining, the, linguistic, sign, terms, adopted, later, on, by, ferdinand, de, saussure, like, significant, and, signifi, the, stoics, studied, phonetics, grammar, and, etymology, as, separate, levels, of, study, in, phonetics, and, phonology, the, articulators, were, defined, the, syllable, became, an, important, structure, for, the, understanding, of, speech, organization, one, of, the, most, important, contributions, of, the, stoics, in, language, study, was, the, gradual, definition, of, the, terminology, and, theory, echoed, in, modern, linguistics, alexandrian, grammarians, also, studied, speech, sounds, and, prosody, they, defined, parts, of, speech, with, notions, such, as, noun, verb, etc, there, was, also, a, discussion, about, the, role, of, analogy, in, language, in, this, discussion, the, grammatici, in, alexandria, supported, the, view, that, language, and, especially, morphology, is, based, on, analogy, or, paradigm, whereas, the, grammatic, in, schools, in, asia, minor, consider, that, language, is, not, based, on, analogical, bases, but, rather, on, exceptions, alexandrians, like, their, predecessors, were, very, interested, in, meter, and, its, role, in, poetry, the, metrical, feet, in, the, greek, was, based, on, the, length, of, time, taken, to, pronounce, each, syllable, with, syllables, categorized, according, to, their, weight, as, either, long, syllables, or, short, syllables, also, known, as, heavy, and, light, syllables, respectively, to, distinguish, them, from, long, and, short, vowels, the, foot, is, often, compared, to, a, musical, measure, and, the, long, and, short, syllables, to, whole, notes, and, half, notes, the, basic, unit, in, greek, and, latin, prosody, is, a, mora, which, is, defined, as, a, single, short, syllable, a, long, syllable, is, equivalent, to, two, moras, a, long, syllable, contains, either, a, long, vowel, a, diphthong, or, a, short, vowel, followed, by, two, or, more, consonants, various, rules, of, elision, sometimes, prevent, a, grammatical, syllable, from, making, a, full, syllable, and, certain, other, lengthening, and, shortening, rules, such, as, correption, can, create, long, or, short, syllables, in, contexts, where, one, would, expect, the, opposite, the, most, important, classical, meter, as, defined, by, the, alexandrian, grammarians, was, the, dactylic, hexameter, the, meter, of, homeric, poetry, this, form, uses, verses, of, six, feet, the, first, four, feet, are, normally, dactyls, but, can, be, spondees, the, fifth, foot, is, almost, always, a, dactyl, the, sixth, foot, is, either, a, spondee, or, a, trochee, the, initial, syllable, of, either, foot, is, called, the, ictus, the, basic, beat, of, the, verse, there, is, usually, a, caesura, after, the, ictus, of, the, third, foot, the, text, t, khn, grammatik, c, 100, bce, gk, gramma, meant, letter, and, this, title, means, art, of, letters, possibly, written, by, dionysius, thrax, 170, 90, bce, is, considered, the, earliest, grammar, book, in, the, greek, tradition, it, lists, eight, parts, of, speech, and, lays, out, the, broad, details, of, greek, morphology, including, the, case, structures, this, text, was, intended, as, a, pedagogic, guide, as, was, panini, and, also, covers, punctuation, and, some, aspects, of, prosody, other, grammars, by, charisius, mainly, a, compilation, of, thrax, as, well, as, lost, texts, by, remmius, palaemon, and, others, and, diomedes, focusing, more, on, prosody, were, popular, in, rome, as, pedagogic, material, for, teaching, greek, to, native, latin, speakers, one, of, the, most, prominent, scholars, of, alexandria, and, of, the, antiquity, was, apollonius, dyscolus, apollonius, wrote, more, than, thirty, treatises, on, questions, of, syntax, semantics, morphology, prosody, orthography, dialectology, and, more, happily, four, of, these, are, preserved, we, still, have, a, syntax, in, four, books, and, three, one, book, monographs, on, pronouns, adverbs, and, connectives, respectively, lexicography, become, an, important, domain, of, study, as, many, grammarians, compiled, dictionaries, thesauri, and, lists, of, special, words, that, were, old, or, dialectical, or, special, such, as, medical, words, or, botanic, words, at, that, period, in, the, early, medieval, times, we, find, more, categories, of, dictionaries, like, the, dictionary, of, suida, considered, the, first, encyclopedic, dictionary, etymological, dictionaries, etc, at, that, period, the, greek, language, functioned, as, a, lingua, franca, a, language, spoken, throughout, the, known, world, for, the, greeks, and, romans, of, that, time, and, as, a, result, modern, linguistics, struggles, to, overcome, this, with, the, greeks, a, tradition, commenced, in, the, study, of, language, the, terminology, invented, by, greek, and, latin, grammarians, in, the, ancient, world, and, medieval, period, continue, as, a, part, of, our, everyday, language, think, for, example, of, notions, such, as, the, word, the, syllable, the, verb, the, subject, etc, in, the, 4th, century, aelius, donatus, compiled, the, latin, grammar, ars, grammatica, that, was, to, be, the, defining, school, text, through, the, middle, ages, a, smaller, version, ars, minor, covered, only, the, eight, parts, of, speech, eventually, when, books, came, to, be, printed, in, the, 15th, century, this, was, one, of, the, first, books, to, be, printed, schoolboys, subjected, to, all, this, education, gave, us, the, current, meaning, of, grammar, attested, in, english, since, 1176, similar, to, the, indian, tradition, chinese, philology, xi, oxu, elementary, studies, emerged, as, an, aid, to, understanding, the, chinese, classics, c, the, 3rd, century, bce, during, the, western, han, dynasty, philology,

fangyan, the, first, chinese, work, concerning, dialects, and, shiming, devoted, to, etymology, as, in, ancient, greece, early, chinese, thinkers, were, concerned, with, the, relationship, between,

linking, words, rather, than, syntax, the, first, modern, chinese, grammar, was, produced, by, ma, jianzhong, late, 19th, century, based, on, a, western, model, owing, to, the, rapid, expansion, of, islam, in, the, 8th, century, many, people, learned, arabic, as, a, lingua, franca, for, this, reason, the, earliest, grammatical, treatises, on, arabic, are, often, written, by, non, native,

of, language, founding, fathers, in, the, 1600s, joannes, goropius, becanus, was, the, oldest, representative, of, dutch, linguistics, he, was, the, first, person, to, publish, a, fragment, of, gothic, mainly, the, lord, s, prayer, franciscus, juniuns, lambert, ten, kate, from, amsterdam, and, george, hickes, from, england, are, considered, to, be, the, founding, fathers, of, german, linguistics, modern, linguistics, did, not, begin, until, the, late, 18th, century, and, the, romantic, or, animist, theses, of, johann, gottfried, herder, and, johann, christoph, adelung, remained, influential, well, into, the, 19th, century, in, the, history, of, american, linguistics, there, were, hundreds, of, indigenous, languages, that, were, never, recorded, many, of, the, languages, were, spoken, not, written, and, so, they, are, now, inaccessible, under, these, circumstances, linguists, such, as, franz, boas, tried, to, prescribe, sound, methodical, principles, for, the, analysis, of, unfamiliar, languages, boas, was, an, influential, linguist, and, was, followed, by, edward, sapir, and, leonard, bloomfield, during, the, 18th, century, conjectural, history, based, on, a, mix, of, linguistics, and, anthropology, on, the, topic, of, both, the, origin, and, progress, of, language, and, society, was, fashionable, these, thinkers, contributed, to, the, construction, of, academic, paradigms, in, which, some, languages, were, labelled, primitive, relative, to, the, english, language, hugh, blair, wrote, that, for, native, americans, certain, motions, and, actions, were, found, to, convey, meaning, as, much, as, what, was, said, verbally, around, the, same, time, james, burnett, authored, a, 6, volume, treatise, that, delved, more, deeply, into, the, matter, of, savage, languages, other, writers, theorized, that, native, american, languages, were, nothing, but, the, natural, and, instinctive, cries, of, the, animal, without, grammatical, structure, the, thinkers, within, this, paradigm, connected, themselves, with, the, greeks, and, romans, viewed, as, the, only, civilized, persons, of, the, ancient, world, a, view, articulated, by, thomas, sheridan, who, compiled, an, important, 18th, century, pronunciation, dictionary, it, was, to, the, care, taken, in, the, cultivation, of, their, languages, that, greece, and, rome, owed, that, splendor, which, eclipsed, all, the, other, nations, of, the, world, in, the, 18th, century, james, burnett, lord, monboddo, analyzed, numerous, languages, and, deduced, logical, elements, of, the, evolution, of, human, languages, his, thinking, was, interleaved, with, his, precursive, concepts, of, biological, evolution, some, of, his, early, concepts, have, been, validated, and, are, considered, correct, today, in, his, the, sanscrit, language, 1786, sir, william, jones, proposed, that, sanskrit, and, persian, had, resemblances, to, classical, greek, latin, gothic, and, celtic, languages, from, this, idea, sprung, the, field, of, comparative, linguistics, and, historical, linguistics, through, the, 19th, century, european, linguistics, centered, on, the, comparative, history, of, the, indo, european, languages, with, a, concern, for, finding, their, common, roots, and, tracing, their, development, in, the, 1820s, wilhelm, von, humboldt, observed, that, human, language, was, a, rule, governed, system, anticipating, a, theme, that, was, to, become, central, in, the, formal, work, on, syntax, and, semantics, of, language, in, the, 20th, century, of, this, observation, he, said, that, it, allowed, language, to, make, infinite, use, of, finite, means, ber, den, dualis, 1827, humboldt, s, work, is, associated, with, the, movement, of, romantic, linguistics, which, was, inspired, by, naturphilosophie, and, romantic, science, other, notable, representatives, of, the, movement, include, friedrich, schlegel, and, franz, bopp, it, was, only, in, the, late, 19th, century, that, the, neogrammarian, approach, of, karl, brugmann, and, others, introduced, a, rigid, notion, of, sound, law, historical, linguistics, also, led, to, the, emergence, of, the, semantics, and, some, forms, of, pragmatics, nerlich, 1992, nerlich, and, clarke, 1996, historical, linguistics, continues, today, and, linguistics, have, succeeded, in, grouping, approximately, 5000, languages, of, the, world, into, a, number, of, common, ancestors, in, europe, there, was, a, development, of, structural, linguistics, initiated, by, ferdinand, de, saussure, a, swiss, professor, of, indo, european, and, general, linguistics, whose, lectures, on, general, linguistics, published, posthumously, by, his, students, set, the, direction, of, european, linguistic, analysis, from, the, 1920s, on, his, approach, has, been, widely, adopted, in, other, fields, under, the, broad, term, structuralism, by, the, 20th, century, the, attention, shifted, from, language, change, to, the, structure, which, is, governed, by, rules, and, principles, this, structure, turned, more, into, grammar, and, by, the, 1920s, structural, linguistic, was, developing, into, sophisticated, methods, of, grammatical, analysis, during, the, second, world, war, north, american, linguists, leonard, bloomfield, william, mandeville, austin, and, several, of, his, students, and, colleagues, developed, teaching, materials, for, a, variety, of, languages, whose, knowledge, was, needed, for, the, war, effort, this, work, led, to, an, increasing, prominence, of, the, field, of, linguistics, which, became, a, recognized, discipline, in, most, american, universities, only, after, the, war, in, 1965, william, stokoe, carl, g, croneberg, and, dorothy, c, casterline, linguists, from, gallaudet, university, published, an, analysis, which, proved, that, american, sign, language, fits, the, criteria, for, a, natural, language, generative, linguistics, focuses, on, modeling, the, subconscious, rules, governing, language, it, started, with, noam, chomsky, s, transformational, grammar, and, has, evolved, into, various, theories, like, government, and, binding, and, the, minimalist, program, core, principles, include, the, distinction, between, competence, and, performance, the, role, of, innate, grammar, universal, grammar, and, the, use, of, explicit, formal, models, to, describe, linguistic, knowledge, from, roughly, 1980, onwards, pragmatic, functional, and, cognitive, approaches, have, steadily, gained, ground, both, in, the, united, states, and, in, europe
