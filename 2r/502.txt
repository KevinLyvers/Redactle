with, as, many, as, 10, 000, members, which, all, failed, without, support, from, the, soviet, union, in, early, 1927, the, kmt, ccp, rivalry, led, to, a, split, in, the, revolutionary, ranks, the, ccp, and, the, left, wing, of, the, kmt, decided, to, move, the, seat, of, the, kmt, government, from, guangzhou, to, wuhan, where, communist, influence, was, strong, however, chiang, and, li,

in, nanchang, went, into, hiding, a, ccp, meeting, on, 7, august, confirmed, the, objective, of, the, party, was, to, seize, the, political, power, by, force, but, the, ccp, was, quickly, suppressed, the, next, day, by, the, nationalist, government, in, wuhan, led, by, wang, jingwei, on, 14, august, chiang, kai, shek, announced, his, temporary, retirement, as, the, wuhan, faction, and, nanjing, faction, of, the, kuomintang, were, allied, once, again, with, common, goal, of, suppressing, the, ccp, after, the, earlier, split, wang, jingwei, took, the, leadership, of, kmt, after, chiang, attempts, were, later, made, by, the, ccp, to, take, the, cities, of, changsha, shantou, and, guangzhou, the, red, army, consisting, of, mutinous, former, national, revolutionary, army, nra, soldiers,

regime, at, nanjing, which, would, remain, the, kmt, capital, for, the, next, decade, this, marked, the, beginning, of, a, ten, year, armed, struggle, known, in, mainland, china, as, the, ten, year, civil, war, which, ended, with, the, xi, an, incident, when, chiang, kai, shek, was, forced, to, form, the, second, united, front, against, invading, forces, from, the, empire, of, japan, in, 1930, the, central, plains, war, broke, out, as, an, internal, conflict, of, the, kmt, launched, by, feng, yuxiang, yan, xishan, and, wang, jingwei, the, attention, was, turned, to, root, out, remaining, pockets, of, ccp, activity, in, a, series, of, five, encirclement, campaigns, the, first, and, second, campaigns, failed, and, the, third, was, aborted, due, to, the, mukden, incident, the, fourth, campaign, 1932, 1933, achieved, some, early, successes, but, chiang, s, armies, were, badly, mauled, when, they, tried, to, penetrate, into, the, heart, of, mao, s, soviet, chinese, republic, during, these, campaigns, kmt, columns, struck, swiftly, into, ccp, areas, but, were, easily, engulfed, by, the, vast, countryside, and, were, not, able, to, consolidate, their, foothold, finally, in, late, 1934, chiang, launched, a, fifth, campaign, that, involved, the, systematic, encirclement, of, the, jiangxi, soviet, region, with, fortified, blockhouses, the, blockhouse, strategy, was, devised, and, implemented, in, part, by, newly, hired, nazi, advisors, unlike, previous, campaigns, in, which, they, penetrated, deeply, in, a, single, strike, this, time, the, kmt, troops, patiently, built, blockhouses, each, separated, by, about, eight, kilometres, five, miles, to, surround, the, communist, areas, and, cut, off, their, supplies, and, food, sources, in, october, 1934, the, ccp, took, advantage, of, gaps, in, the, ring, of, blockhouses, manned, by, the, forces, of, a, warlord, ally, of, chiang, kai, shek, s, rather, than, regular, kmt, troops, and, broke, out, of, the, encirclement, the, warlord, armies, were, reluctant, to, challenge, communist, forces, for, fear, of, losing, their, own, men, and, did, not, pursue, the, ccp, with, much, fervor, in, addition, the, main, kmt, forces, were, preoccupied, with, annihilating, zhang, guotao, s, army, which, was, much, larger, than, mao, s, the, massive, military, retreat, of, communist, forces, lasted, a, year, and, covered, what, mao, estimated, as, 12, 500, km, 25, 000, li, it, became, known, as, the, long, march, this, military, retreat, was, undertaken, by, the, chinese, communist, party, led, by, mao, zedong, to, evade, the, pursuit, or, attack, of, the, kuomintang, army, it, consisted, of, a, series, of, marches, during, which, numerous, communist, armies, in, the, south, escaped, to, the, north, and, west, over, the, course, of, the, march, from, jiangxi, the, first, front, army, led, by, an, inexperienced, military, commission, was, on, the, brink, of, annihilation, by, chiang, kai, shek, s, troops, as, their, stronghold, was, in, jiangxi, the, communists, under, the, command, of, mao, zedong, and, zhou, enlai, escaped, in, a, circling, retreat, to, the, west, and, north, which, reportedly, traversed, over, 9, 000, kilometers, over, 370, days, the, route, passed, through, some, of, the, most, difficult, terrain, of, western, china, by, traveling, west, and, then, northwards, towards, shaanxi, in, november, 1935, shortly, after, settling, in, northern, shaanxi, mao, officially, took, over, zhou, enlai, s, leading, position, in, the, red, army, following, a, major, reshuffling, of, official, roles, mao, became, the, chairman, of, the, military, commission, with, zhou, and, deng, xiaoping, as, vice, chairmen, this, marked, mao, s, position, as, the, pre, eminent, leader, of, the, ccp, with, zhou, in, second, position, to, him, the, march, ended, when, the, ccp, reached, the, interior, of, shaanxi, zhang, guotao, s, army, red, 4th, front, army, which, took, a, different, route, through, northwest, china, was, largely, destroyed, by, the, forces, of, chiang, kai, shek, and, his, chinese, muslim, allies, the, ma, clique, along, the, way, the, communist, army, confiscated, property, and, weapons, from, local, warlords, and, landlords, while, recruiting, peasants, and, the, poor, solidifying, its, appeal, to, the, masses, of, the, 90, 000, 100, 000, people, who, began, the, long, march, from, the, soviet, chinese, republic, only, around, 7, 000, 8, 000, made, it, to, shaanxi, the, remnants, of, zhang, s, forces, eventually, joined, mao, in, shaanxi, but, with, his, army, destroyed, zhang, even, as, a, founding, member, of, the, ccp, was, never, able, to, challenge, mao, s, authority, essentially, the, great, retreat, made, mao, the, undisputed, leader, of, the, chinese, communist, party, the, kuomintang, used, khampa, troops, who, were, former, bandits, to, battle, the, communist, red, army, as, it, advanced, and, to, undermine, local, warlords, who, often, refused, to, fight, communist, forces, to, conserve, their, own, strength, the, kmt, enlisted, 300, khampa, bandits, into, its, consolatory, commission, military, in, sichuan, where, they, were, part, of, the, effort, of, the, central, government, to, penetrate, and, destabilize, local, han, warlords, such, as, liu, wenhui, the, government, was, seeking, to, exert, full, control, over, frontier, areas, against, the, warlords, liu, had, refused, to, battle, the, communists, in, order, to, conserve, his, army, the, consolatory, commission, forces, were, used, to, battle, the, red, army, but, they, were, defeated, when, their, religious, leader, was, captured, by, the, communists, in, 1936, zhou, enlai, and, zhang, xueliang, grew, closer, with, zhou, even, suggesting, that, he, join, the, ccp, however, this, was, turned, down, by, the, comintern, in, the, ussr, later, on, zhou, persuaded, zhang, and, yang, hucheng, another, warlord, to, instigate, the, xi, an, incident, chiang, was, placed, under, house, arrest, and, forced, to, stop, his, attacks, on, the, red, army, instead, focusing, on, the, japanese, threat, during, japan, s, invasion, and, occupation, of, manchuria, chiang, kai, shek, saw, the, ccp, as, the, greater, threat, chiang, refused, to, ally, with, the, ccp, preferring, to, unite, china, by, eliminating, the, warlord, and, ccp, forces, first, he, believed, his, forces, were, too, weak, to, face, the, japanese, imperial, army, only, after, unification, could, the, kmt, mobilize, against, japan, he, ignored, the, chinese, people, s, discontent, and, anger, at, the, kmt, policy, of, compromise, with, the, japanese, instead, ordering, kmt, generals, zhang, xueliang, and, yang, hucheng, to, suppress, the, ccp, however, their, provincial, forces, suffered, significant, casualties, in, battles, against, the, red, army, on, 12, december, 1936, the, disgruntled, zhang, and, yang, conspired, to, kidnap, chiang, and, force, him, into, a, truce, with, the, ccp, the, incident, became, known, as, the, xi, an, incident, both, parties, suspended, fighting, to, form, a, second, united, front, to, focus, their, energies, and, fight, the, japanese, in, 1937, japan, launched, its, full, scale, invasion, of, china, and, its, well, equipped, troops, overran, kmt, defenders, in, northern, and, coastal, china, the, alliance, of, ccp, and, kmt, was, in, name, only, unlike, the, kmt, forces, ccp, troops, shunned, conventional, warfare, and, instead, waged, guerrilla, warfare, against, the, japanese, the, level, of, actual, cooperation, and, coordination, between, the, ccp, and, kmt, during, world, war, ii, was, minimal, in, the, midst, of, the, second, united, front, the, ccp, and, the, kmt, were, still, vying, for, territorial, advantage, in, free, china, i, e, areas, not, occupied, by, the, japanese, or, ruled, by, japanese, puppet, governments, such, as, manchukuo, and, the, reorganized, national, government, of, china, the, situation, came, to, a, head, in, late, 1940, and, early, 1941, when, clashes, between, communist, and, kmt, forces, intensified, chiang, demanded, in, december, 1940, that, the, ccp, s, new, fourth, army, evacuate, anhui, and, jiangsu, provinces, due, to, its, provocation, and, harassment, of, kmt, forces, in, this, area, under, intense, pressure, the, new, fourth, army, commanders, complied, the, following, year, they, were, ambushed, by, kmt, forces, during, their, evacuation, which, led, to, several, thousand, deaths, it, also, ended, the, second, united, front, formed, earlier, to, fight, the, japanese, as, clashes, between, the, ccp, and, kmt, intensified, countries, such, as, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, attempted, to, prevent, a, disastrous, civil, war, after, the, new, fourth, army, incident, us, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, sent, special, envoy, lauchlin, currie, to, talk, with, chiang, kai, shek, and, kmt, party, leaders, to, express, their, concern, regarding, the, hostility, between, the, two, parties, with, currie, stating, that, the, only, ones, to, benefit, from, a, civil, war, would, be, the, japanese, the, soviet, union, allied, more, closely, with, the, ccp, sent, an, imperative, telegram, to, mao, in, 1941, warning, that, civil, war, would, also, make, the, situation, easier, for, the, japanese, military, due, to, the, international, community, s, efforts, there, was, a, temporary, and, superficial, peace, chiang, criticized, the, ccp, in, 1943, with, the, propaganda, piece, china, s, destiny, which, questioned, the, ccp, s, power, after, the, war, while, the, ccp, strongly, opposed, chiang, s, leadership, and, referred, to, his, regime, as, fascist, in, an, attempt, to, generate, a, negative, public, image, both, leaders, knew, that, a, deadly, battle, had, begun, between, themselves, in, general, developments, in, the, second, sino, japanese, war, were, to, the, advantage, of, the, ccp, as, its, guerrilla, war, tactics, had, won, them, popular, support, within, the, japanese, occupied, areas, however, the, kmt, had, to, defend, the, country, against, the, main, japanese, campaigns, since, it, was, the, legal, chinese, government, a, factor, which, proved, costly, to, chiang, kai, shek, and, his, troops, japan, launched, its, last, major, offensive, against, the, kmt, operation, ichi, go, in, 1944, which, resulted, in, the, severe, weakening, of, chiang, s, forces, the, ccp, also, suffered, fewer, losses, through, its, guerrilla, tactics, by, the, end, of, the, war, the, red, army, had, grown, to, more, than, 1, 3, million, members, with, a, separate, militia, of, over, 2, 6, million, about, one, hundred, million, people, lived, in, ccp, controlled, zones, under, the, terms, of, the, japanese, unconditional, surrender, dictated, by, the, allies, japanese, troops, were, to, surrender, to, kmt, troops, but, not, to, the, ccp, which, was, present, in, some, of, the, occupied, areas, in, manchuria, however, where, the, kmt, had, no, forces, the, japanese, surrendered, to, the, soviet, union, chiang, kai, shek, reminded, japanese, troops, to, remain, at, their, posts, to, receive, the, kmt, but, communist, forces, soon, began, taking, surrenders, from, the, japanese, and, fighting, those, who, resisted, general, wedemeyer, of, the, united, states, army, became, alarmed, at, these, developments, and, wanted, seven, american, divisions, to, be, sent, to, china, but, general, marshall, replied, that, it, should, not, be, given, priority, over, japan, and, korea, the, first, post, war, peace, negotiation, attended, by, both, chiang, kai, shek, and, mao, zedong, was, in, chongqing, from, 28, august, to, 10, october, 1945, chiang, entered, the, meeting, at, an, advantage, because, he, had, recently, signed, a, friendly, treaty, with, the, soviet, union, while, the, communists, were, still, forcing, the, japanese, to, surrender, in, some, places, mao, was, accompanied, by, american, ambassador, patrick, j, hurley, who, was, devoted, to, chiang, but, also, wanted, to, ensure, mao, s, safety, in, light, of, the, past, history, between, the, two, chinese, leaders, it, concluded, with, the, signing, of, the, double, tenth, agreement, both, sides, stressed, the, importance, of, a, peaceful, reconstruction, but, the, conference, did, not, produce, any, concrete, results, battles, between, the, two, sides, continued, even, as, peace, negotiations, were, in, progress, until, the, agreement, was, reached, in, january, 1946, however, large, campaigns, and, full, scale, confrontations, between, the, ccp, and, chiang, s, troops, were, temporarily, avoided, in, the, last, month, of, world, war, ii, in, east, asia, soviet, forces, launched, the, huge, manchurian, strategic, offensive, operation, against, the, japanese, kwantung, army, in, manchuria, and, along, the, chinese, mongolian, border, this, operation, destroyed, the, kwantung, army, in, just, three, weeks, and, left, the, ussr, occupying, all, of, manchuria, by, the, end, of, the, war, in, a, total, power, vacuum, of, local, chinese, forces, consequently, the, 700, 000, japanese, troops, stationed, in, the, region, surrendered, later, in, the, year, chiang, kai, shek, realized, that, he, lacked, the, resources, to, prevent, a, ccp, takeover, of, manchuria, following, the, scheduled, soviet, departure, he, therefore, made, a, deal, with, the, soviets, to, delay, their, withdrawal, until, he, had, moved, enough, of, his, best, trained, men, and, modern, materiel, into, the, region, however, the, soviets, refused, permission, for, the, nationalist, troops, to, traverse, its, territory, and, spent, the, extra, time, systematically, dismantling, the, extensive, manchurian, industrial, base, worth, up, to, 2, billion, and, shipping, it, back, to, their, war, ravaged, country, kmt, troops, were, then, airlifted, by, the, us, to, occupy, key, cities, in, north, china, while, the, countryside, was, already, dominated, by, the, ccp, on, 15, november, 1945, the, kmt, began, a, campaign, to, prevent, the, ccp, from, strengthening, its, already, strong, base, at, the, same, time, however, the, return, of, the, kmt, also, brought, widespread, graft, and, corruption, with, an, oss, officer, remarking, that, the, only, winners, were, the, communists, in, the, winter, of, 1945, 46, joseph, stalin, commanded, marshal, rodion, malinovsky, to, give, mao, zedong, most, imperial, japanese, army, weapons, that, were, captured, chiang, kai, shek, s, forces, pushed, as, far, as, chinchow, jinzhou, by, 26, november, 1945, meeting, with, little, resistance, this, was, followed, by, a, communist, offensive, on, the,

full, scale, war, between, ccp, and, kmt, forces, broke, out, on, 26, june, 1946, china, then, entered, a, state, of, civil, war, that, lasted, more, than, three, years, by, the, end, of, the, second, sino, japanese, war, the, power, of, the, chinese, communist, party, grew, considerably, their, main, force, grew, to, 1, 2, million, troops, backed, with, additional, militia, of, 2, million, totalling, 3, 2, million, troops, their, liberated, zone, in, 1945, contained, 19, base, areas, including, one, quarter, of, the, country, s, territory, and, one, third, of, its, population, this, included, many, important, towns, and, cities, moreover, the, soviet, union, turned, over, all, of, its, captured, japanese, weapons, and, a, substantial, amount, of, their, own, supplies, to, the,

rodion, malinovsky, continued, to, delay, pulling, out, of, manchuria, while, malinovsky, secretly, told, the, ccp, forces, to, move, in, behind, them, which, led, to, full, scale, war, for, the, control, of, the, northeast, these, favorable, conditions, also, facilitated, many, changes, inside, the, communist, leadership, the, more, radical, hard, line, faction, who, wanted, a, complete, military, take, over, of, china, finally, gained, the, upper, hand, and, defeated, the, careful, opportunists, before, giving, control, to, communist, leaders, on, 27, march, soviet, diplomats, requested, a, joint, venture, of, industrial, development, with, the, nationalist, party, in, manchuria, although, general, marshall, stated, that, he, knew, of, no, evidence, that, the, ccp, was, being, supplied, by, the, soviet, union, the, ccp, was, able, to, utilize, a, large, number, of, weapons, abandoned, by, the, japanese, including, some, tanks, when, large, numbers, of, well, trained, kmt, troops, began, to, defect, to, the, communist, forces, the, ccp, was, finally, able, to, achieve, material, superiority, the, ccp, s, most, effective, political, reform, was, its, land, reform, policy, this, drew, the, massive, number, of, landless, and, starving, peasants, in, the, countryside, into, the, communist, cause, this, strategy, enabled, the, ccp, to, access, an, almost, unlimited, supply, of, manpower, for, both, combat, and, logistical, purposes, despite, suffering, heavy, casualties, throughout, many, of, the, war, s, campaigns, manpower, continued, to, grow, for,

it, was, perfectly, clear, to, us, that, if, we, told, the, japanese, to, lay, down, their, arms, immediately, and, march, to, the, seaboard, the, entire, country, would, be, taken, over, by, the, communists, we, therefore, had, to, take, the, unusual, step, of, using, the, enemy, as, a, garrison, until, we, could, airlift, chinese, national, troops, to, south, china, and, send, marines, to, guard, the, seaports, using, the, pretext, of, receiving, the, japanese, surrender, business, interests, within, the, kmt, government, occupied, most, of, the, banks, factories, and, commercial,

to, mao, zedong, there, were, three, ways, of, staving, off, imperialist, intervention, in, the, short, term, during, the, continuation, of, the, chinese, revolution, the, first, was, through, a, rapid, completion, of, the, military, takeover, of, the, country, and, through, showing, determination, and, strength, against, foreign, attempts, at, challenging, the, new, regime, along, its, borders, the, second, was, by, formalising, a, comprehensive, military, alliance, with, the, soviet, union, which, would, dedicate, soviet, power, to, directly, defending, china, against, its, enemies, this, aspect, became, extensively, significant, given, the, backdrop, of, the, start, of, the, cold, war, and, finally, the, regime, had, to, root, out, its, domestic, opponents, the, heads, of, secret, societies, religious, sects, independent, unions, or, tribal, and, ethnic, organisations, by, destroying, the, basis, of, domestic, reaction, mao, believed, a, safer, world, for, the,

china, was, furious, again, but, the, military, drills, were, stopped, by, the, 921, earthquakes, it, was, the, last, tense, moment, of, this, civil, war, with, the, election, in, 2000, of, democratic, progressive, party, candidate, chen, shui, bian, a, party, other, than, the, kmt, gained, the, presidency, for, the, first, time, in, taiwan, the, new, president, did, not, share, the, chinese, nationalist, ideology, of, the, kmt, and, ccp, this, led, to, tension, between, the, two, sides, although, trade, and, other, ties, such, as, the, 2005, pan, blue, visit, continued, to, increase, with, the, election, of, pro, mainland, president, ma, ying, jeou, kmt, in, 2008, significant, warming, of, relations, resumed, between, taipei, and, beijing, with, high, level, exchanges,

and, political, scientists, cite, a, number, of, factors, including, the, ccp, s, success, at, mobilizing, mass, support, and, the, shortcomings, of, the, nationalist, government, 1, almost, all, studies, of, the, failure, of, the, nationalist, government, identify, hyperinflation, as, a, major, factor, in, the, government, s, collapse, 5, the, nationalist, military, and, the, government, s, civilian, employees, were, most, impacted, by, hyperinflation, which, in, turn, prompted, widespread, corruption, and, pilfering, 5, little, funding, reached, enlisted, soldiers, who, were, typically, malnourished, and, poorly, equipped, 9, desertion, was, common, 9, the, historian, rana, mitter, writes, that, a, lack, of, trust, in, the, nationalist, government, developed, as, it, was, increasingly, seen, as, corrupt, vindictive, and, with, no, overall, vision, of, what, china, under, its, rule, should, look, like, chiang, wrote, in, his, diary, in, june, 1948, after, the, fall, of, kaifeng, our, conditions, worsened, and, became, more, serious, i, now, realized, that, the, main, reason, our, nation, has, collapsed, time, after, time, throughout, our, history, was, not, because, of, superior, power, used, by, our, external, enemies, but, because, of, disintegration, and, rot, from, within, historian, odd, arne, westad, says, the, communists, won, the, civil, war, because, they, made, fewer, military, mistakes, than, chiang, kai, shek, and, also, because, in, his, search, for, a, powerful, centralized, government, chiang, antagonized, too, many, interest, groups, in, china, furthermore, his, party, was, weakened, in, the, war, against, the, japanese, meanwhile, the, communists, targeted, different, groups, such, as, peasants, and, brought, them, to, their, side,

the, nationalists, as, corrupt, reactionary, and, inefficient, he, believed, that, the, nationalists, had, displayed, both, political, inadequacy, as, well, as, the, grossest, incompetence, ever, experienced, by, any, military, command, and, that, the, communists, did, not, create, this, condition, but, skillfully, exploited, the, opportunity, it, provided, in, the, meantime, the, communists, continued, their, land, reform, programs, winning, the, support, of, the, population, in, the, countryside, this, was, a, decisive, factor, in, the, communists, success, millions, of, peasants, who, obtained, land, through, the, movement, joined, the, people, s, liberation, army, or, assisted, in, its, logistical, networks, according, to, historian, brian, demare, land, redistribution, was, a, critical, factor, because, it, linked, the, interests, of, peasants, in, the, north, and, northeast, to, the, communists, success, ultimately, the, communists, obtained, the, greatest, popular, support, of, any, insurgency, in, modern, history, 3, an, important, advantage, of, the, communists, was, the, extraordinary, cohesion, within, its, top, leadership, this, cohesion, not, only,

and, kmt, s, military, setback, in, northeast, china, historians, such, as, jay, taylor, robert, cowley, and, anne, w, carroll, argue, that, the, nationalists, failure, was, largely, caused, by,
