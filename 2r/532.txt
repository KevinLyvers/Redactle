rebellion, of, 1857, was, a, major, uprising, in, india, in, 1857, 58, against, the, rule, of, the, british, east, india, company, which, functioned, as, a, sovereign, power, on, behalf, of, the, british, crown, the, rebellion, began, on, 10, may, 1857, in, the, form, of, a, mutiny, of, sepoys, of, the, company, s, army, in, the, garrison, town, of, meerut, 40, mi, 64, km, northeast, of, delhi, it, then, erupted, into, other, mutinies, and, civilian, rebellions, chiefly, in, the, upper, gangetic, plain, and, central, india, though, incidents, of, revolt, also, occurred, farther, north, and, east, the, rebellion, posed, a, military, threat, to, british, power, in, that, region, and, was, contained, only, with, the, rebels, defeat, in, gwalior, on, 20, june, 1858, on, 1, november, 1858, the, british, granted, amnesty, to, all, rebels, not, involved, in, murder, though, they, did, not, declare, the, hostilities, to, have, formally, ended, until, 8, july, 1859, the, name, of, the, revolt, is, contested, and, it, is, variously, described, as, the, sepoy, mutiny, the, indian, mutiny, the, great, rebellion, the, revolt, of, 1857, the, indian, insurrection, and, the, first, war, of, independence, the, indian, rebellion, was, fed, by, resentments, born, of, diverse, perceptions, including, invasive, british, style, social, reforms, harsh, land, taxes, summary, treatment, of, some, rich, landowners, and, princes, and, scepticism, about, the, improvements, brought, about, by, british, rule, many, indians, rose, against, the, british, however, many, also, fought, for, the, british, and, the, majority, remained, seemingly, compliant, to, british, rule, violence, which, sometimes, betrayed, exceptional, cruelty, was, inflicted, on, both, sides, on, british, officers, and, civilians, including, women, and, children, by, the, rebels, and, on, the, rebels, and, their, supporters, including, sometimes, entire, villages, by, british, reprisals, the, cities, of, delhi, and, lucknow, were, laid, waste, in, the, fighting, and, the, british, retaliation, after, the, outbreak, of, the, mutiny, in, meerut, the, rebels, quickly, reached, delhi, whose, 81, year, old, mughal, ruler, bahadur, shah, zafar, was, declared, the, emperor, of, hindustan, soon, the, rebels, had, captured, large, tracts, of, the, north, western, provinces, and, awadh, oudh, the, east, india, company, s, response, came, rapidly, as, well, with, help, from, reinforcements, kanpur, was, retaken, by, mid, july, 1857, and, delhi, by, the, end, of, september, however, it, then, took, the, remainder, of, 1857, and, the, better, part, of, 1858, for, the, rebellion, to, be, suppressed, in, jhansi, lucknow, and, especially, the, awadh, countryside, other, regions, of, company, controlled, india, bengal, province, the, bombay, presidency, and, the, madras, presidency, remained, largely, calm, in, the, punjab, the, sikh, princes, crucially, helped, the, british, by, providing, both, soldiers, and, support, the, large, princely, states, hyderabad, mysore, travancore, and, kashmir, as, well, as, the, smaller, ones, of, rajputana, did, not, join, the, rebellion, serving, the, british, in, the, governor, general, lord, canning, s, words, as, breakwaters, in, a, storm, in, some, regions, most, notably, in, awadh, the, rebellion, took, on, the, attributes, of, a, patriotic, revolt, against, british, oppression, however, the, rebel, leaders, proclaimed, no, articles, of, faith, that, presaged, a, new, political, system, even, so, the, rebellion, proved, to, be, an, important, watershed, in, indian, and, british, empire, history, it, led, to, the, dissolution, of, the, east, india, company, and, forced, the, british, to, reorganize, the, army, the, financial, system, and, the, administration, in, india, through, passage, of, the, government, of, india, act, 1858, india, was, thereafter, administered, directly, by, the, british, government, in, the, new, british, raj, on, 1, november, 1858, queen, victoria, issued, a, proclamation, to, indians, which, while, lacking, the, authority, of, a, constitutional, provision, promised, rights, similar, to, those, of, other, british, subjects, in, the, following, decades, when, admission, to, these, rights, was, not, always, forthcoming, indians, were, to, pointedly, refer, to, the, queen, s, proclamation, in, growing, avowals, of, a, new, nationalism, although, the, british, east, india, company, had, established, a, presence, in, india, as, far, back, as, 1612, and, earlier, administered, the, factory, areas, established, for, trading, purposes, its, victory, in, the, battle, of, plassey, in, 1757, marked, the, beginning, of, its, firm, foothold, in, eastern, india, the, victory, was, consolidated, in, 1764, at, the, battle, of, buxar, when, the, east, india, company, army, defeated, mughal, emperor, shah, alam, ii, after, his, defeat, the, emperor, granted, the, company, the, right, to, the, collection, of, revenue, in, the, provinces, of, bengal, modern, day, bengal, bihar, and, odisha, known, as, diwani, to, the, company, the, company, soon, expanded, its, territories, around, its, bases, in, bombay, and, madras, later, the, anglo, mysore, wars, 1766, 1799, and, the, anglo, maratha, wars, 1772, 1818, led, to, control, of, even, more, of, india, in, 1806, the, vellore, mutiny, was, sparked, by, new, uniform, regulations, that, created, resentment, amongst, both, hindu, and, muslim, sepoys, after, the, turn, of, the, 19th, century, governor, general, wellesley, began, what, became, two, decades, of, accelerated, expansion, of, company, territories, this, was, achieved, either, by, subsidiary, alliances, between, the, company, and, local, rulers, or, by, direct, military, annexation, the, subsidiary, alliances, created, the, princely, states, of, the, hindu, maharajas, and, the, muslim, nawabs, punjab, north, west, frontier, province, and, kashmir, were, annexed, after, the, second, anglo, sikh, war, in, 1849, however, kashmir, was, immediately, sold, under, the, 1846, treaty, of, amritsar, to, the, dogra, dynasty, of, jammu, and, thereby, became, a, princely, state, the, border, dispute, between, nepal, and, british, india, which, sharpened, after, 1801, had, caused, the, anglo, nepalese, war, of, 1814, 16, and, brought, the, defeated, gurkhas, under, british, influence, in, 1854, berar, was, annexed, and, the, state, of, oudh, was, added, two, years, later, for, practical, purposes, the, company, was, the, government, of, much, of, india, the, indian, rebellion, of, 1857, occurred, as, the, result, of, an, accumulation, of, factors, over, time, rather, than, any, single, event, the, sepoys, were, indian, soldiers, who, were, recruited, into, the, company, s, army, just, before, the, rebellion, there, were, over, 300, 000, sepoys, in, the, army, compared, to, about, 50, 000, british, the, east, india, company, s, forces, were, divided, into, three, presidency, armies, bombay, madras, and, bengal, the, bengal, army, recruited, higher, castes, such, as, brahmins, rajputs, and, bhumihar, mostly, from, the, awadh, and, bihar, regions, and, even, restricted, the, enlistment, of, lower, castes, in, 1855, in, contrast, the, madras, army, and, bombay, army, were, more, localized, caste, neutral, armies, that, did, not, prefer, high, caste, men, the, domination, of, higher, castes, in, the, bengal, army, has, been, blamed, in, part, for, initial, mutinies, that, led, to, the, rebellion, in, 1772, when, warren, hastings, was, appointed, fort, william, s, first, governor, general, one, of, his, first, undertakings, was, the, rapid, expansion, of, the, company, s, army, since, the, sepoys, from, bengal, many, of, whom, had, fought, against, the, company, in, the, battles, of, plassey, and, buxar, were, now, suspect, in, british, eyes, hastings, recruited, farther, west, from, the, high, caste, rural, rajputs, and, bhumihar, of, awadh, and, bihar, a, practice, that, continued, for, the, next, 75, years, however, in, order, to, forestall, any, social, friction, the, company, also, took, action, to, adapt, its, military, practices, to, the, requirements, of, their, religious, rituals, consequently, these, soldiers, dined, in, separate, facilities, in, addition, overseas, service, considered, polluting, to, their, caste, was, not, required, of, them, and, the, army, soon, came, officially, to, recognise, hindu, festivals, this, encouragement, of, high, caste, ritual, status, however, left, the, government, vulnerable, to, protest, even, mutiny, whenever, the, sepoys, detected, infringement, of, their, prerogatives, stokes, argues, that, the, british, scrupulously, avoided, interference, with, the, social, structure, of, the, village, community, which, remained, largely, intact, after, the, annexation, of, oudh, awadh, by, the, east, india, company, in, 1856, many, sepoys, were, disquieted, both, from, losing, their, perquisites, as, landed, gentry, in, the, oudh, courts, and, from, the, anticipation, of, any, increased, land, revenue, payments, that, the, annexation, might, bring, about, other, historians, have, stressed, that, by, 1857, some, indian, soldiers, interpreting, the, presence, of, missionaries, as, a, sign, of, official, intent, were, convinced, that, the, company, was, masterminding, mass, conversions, of, hindus, and, muslims, to, christianity, although, earlier, in, the, 1830s, evangelicals, such, as, william, carey, and, william, wilberforce, had, successfully, clamoured, for, the, passage, of, social, reform, such, as, the, abolition, of, sati, and, allowing, the, remarriage, of, hindu, widows, there, is, little, evidence, that, the, sepoys, allegiance, was, affected, by, this, however, changes, in, the, terms, of, their, professional, service, may, have, created, resentment, as, the, extent, of, the, east, india, company, s, jurisdiction, expanded, with, victories, in, wars, or, annexation, the, soldiers, were, now, expected, not, only, to, serve, in, less, familiar, regions, such, as, in, burma, but, also, to, make, do, without, the, foreign, service, remuneration, that, had, previously, been, their, due, a, major, cause, of, resentment, that, arose, ten, months, prior, to, the, outbreak, of, the, rebellion, was, the, general, service, enlistment, act, of, 25, july, 1856, as, noted, above, men, of, the, bengal, army, had, been, exempted, from, overseas, service, specifically, they, were, enlisted, only, for, service, in, territories, to, which, they, could, march, governor, general, lord, dalhousie, saw, this, as, an, anomaly, since, all, sepoys, of, the, madras, and, bombay, armies, and, the, six, general, service, battalions, of, the, bengal, army, had, accepted, an, obligation, to, serve, overseas, if, required, as, a, result, the, burden, of, providing, contingents, for, active, service, in, burma, readily, accessible, only, by, sea, and, china, had, fallen, disproportionately, on, the, two, smaller, presidency, armies, as, signed, into, effect, by, lord, canning, dalhousie, s, successor, as, governor, general, the, act, required, only, new, recruits, to, the, bengal, army, to, accept, a, commitment, for, general, service, however, serving, high, caste, sepoys, were, fearful, that, it, would, be, eventually, extended, to, them, as, well, as, preventing, sons, following, fathers, into, an, army, with, a, strong, tradition, of, family, service, 261, there, were, also, grievances, over, the, issue, of, promotions, based, on, seniority, this, as, well, as, the, increasing, number, of, british, officers, in, the, battalions, made, promotion, slow, and, many, indian, officers, did, not, reach, commissioned, rank, until, they, were, too, old, to, be, effective, the, final, spark, was, provided, by, the, ammunition, for, the, new, enfield, pattern, 1853, rifled, musket, these, rifles, which, fired, mini, balls, had, a, tighter, fit, than, the, earlier, muskets, and, used, paper, cartridges, that, came, pre, greased, to, load, the, rifle, sepoys, had, to, bite, the, cartridge, open, to, release, the, powder, the, grease, used, on, these, cartridges, was, rumoured, to, include, tallow, derived, from, beef, which, would, be, offensive, to, hindus, and, lard, derived, from, pork, which, would, be, offensive, to, muslims, at, least, one, company, official, pointed, out, the, difficulties, this, might, cause, unless, it, be, proven, that, the, grease, employed, in, these, cartridges, is, not, of, a, nature, to, offend, or, interfere, with, the, prejudices, of, religion, it, will, be, expedient, not, to, issue, them, for, test, to, native, corps, however, in, august, 1856, greased, cartridge, production, was, initiated, at, fort, william, calcutta, following, a, british, design, the, grease, used, included, tallow, supplied, by, the, indian, firm, of, gangadarh, banerji, co, by, january, rumours, abounded, that, the, enfield, cartridges, were, greased, with, animal, fat, company, officers, became, aware, of, the, rumours, through, reports, of, an, altercation, between, a, high, caste, sepoy, and, a, low, caste, labourer, at, dum, dum, the, labourer, had, taunted, the, sepoy, that, by, biting, the, cartridge, he, had, himself, lost, caste, although, at, this, time, such, cartridges, had, been, issued, only, at, meerut, and, not, at, dum, dum, there, had, been, rumours, that, the, british, sought, to, destroy, the, religions, of, the, indian, people, and, forcing, the, native, soldiers, to, break, their, sacred, code, would, have, certainly, added, to, this, rumour, as, it, apparently, did, the, company, was, quick, to, reverse, the, effects, of, this, policy, in, hopes, that, the, unrest, would, be, quelled, on, 27, january, colonel, richard, birch, the, military, secretary, ordered, that, all, cartridges, issued, from, depots, were, to, be, free, from, grease, and, that, sepoys, could, grease, them, themselves, using, whatever, mixture, they, may, prefer, a, modification, was, also, made, to, the, drill, for, loading, so, that, the, cartridge, was, torn, with, the, hands, and, not, bitten, this, however, merely, caused, many, sepoys, to, be, convinced, that, the, rumours, were, true, and, that, their, fears, were, justified, additional, rumours, started, that, the, paper, in, the, new, cartridges, which, was, glazed, and, stiffer, than, the, previously, used, paper, was, impregnated, with, grease, in, february, a, court, of, inquiry, was, held, at, barrackpore, to, get, to, the, bottom, of, these, rumours, native, soldiers, called, as, witnesses, complained, of, the, paper, being, stiff, and, like, cloth, in, the, mode, of, tearing, said, that, when, the, paper, was, burned, it, smelled, of, grease, and, announced, that, the, suspicion, that, the, paper, itself, contained, grease, could, not, be, removed, from, their, minds, civilian, rebellion, was, more, multifarious, the, rebels, consisted, of, three, groups, the, feudal, nobility, rural, landlords, called, taluqdars, and, the, peasants, the, nobility, many, of, whom, had, lost, titles, and, domains, under, the, doctrine, of, lapse, which, refused, to, recognise, the, adopted, children, of, princes, as, legal, heirs, felt, that, the, company, had, interfered, with, a, traditional, system, of, inheritance, rebel, leaders, such, as, nana, sahib, and, the, rani, of, jhansi, belonged, to, this, group, the, latter, for, example, was, prepared, to, accept, east, india, company, supremacy, if, her, adopted, son, was, recognised, as, her, late, husband, s, heir, in, other, areas, of, central, india, such, as, indore, and, sagar, where, such, loss, of, privilege, had, not, occurred, the, princes, remained, loyal, to, the, company, even, in, areas, where, the, sepoys, had, rebelled, the, second, group, the, taluqdars, had, lost, half, their, landed, estates, to, peasant, farmers, as, a, result, of, the, land, reforms, that, came, in, the, wake, of, annexation, of, oudh, it, is, mentioned, that, throughout, oudh, and, bihar, rajput, taluqdars, provided, the, bulk, of, leadership, and, played, an, important, role, during, 1857, in, the, region, as, the, rebellion, gained, ground, the, taluqdars, quickly, reoccupied, the, lands, they, had, lost, and, paradoxically, in, part, because, of, ties, of, kinship, and, feudal, loyalty, did, not, experience, significant, opposition, from, the, peasant, farmers, many, of, whom, joined, the, rebellion, to, the, great, dismay, of, the, british, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, heavy, land, revenue, assessment, in, some, areas, by, the, british, resulted, in, many, landowning, families, either, losing, their, land, or, going, into, great, debt, to, money, lenders, and, providing, ultimately, a, reason, to, rebel, money, lenders, in, addition, to, the, company, were, particular, objects, of, the, rebels, animosity, the, civilian, rebellion, was, also, highly, uneven, in, its, geographic, distribution, even, in, areas, of, north, central, india, that, were, no, longer, under, british, control, for, example, the, relatively, prosperous, muzaffarnagar, district, a, beneficiary, of, a, company, irrigation, scheme, and, next, door, to, meerut, where, the, upheaval, began, stayed, relatively, calm, throughout, utilitarian, and, evangelical, inspired, social, reform, including, the, abolition, of, sati, and, the, legalisation, of, widow, remarriage, were, considered, by, many, especially, the, british, themselves, to, have, caused, suspicion, that, indian, religious, traditions, were, being, interfered, with, with, the, ultimate, aim, of, conversion, recent, historians, including, chris, bayly, have, preferred, to, frame, this, as, a, clash, of, knowledges, with, proclamations, from, religious, authorities, before, the, revolt, and, testimony, after, it, including, on, such, issues, as, the, insults, to, women, the, rise, of, low, people, under, british, tutelage, the, pollution, caused, by, western, medicine, and, the, persecuting, and, ignoring, of, traditional, astrological, authorities, british, run, schools, were, also, a, problem, according, to, recorded, testimonies, anger, had, spread, because, of, stories, that, mathematics, was, replacing, religious, instruction, stories, were, chosen, that, would, bring, contempt, upon, indian, religions, and, because, girl, children, were, exposed, to, moral, danger, by, education, the, justice, system, was, considered, to, be, inherently, unfair, to, the, indians, the, official, blue, books, east, india, torture, 1855, 1857, laid, before, the, house, of, commons, during, the, sessions, of, 1856, and, 1857, revealed, that, company, officers, were, allowed, an, extended, series, of, appeals, if, convicted, or, accused, of, brutality, or, crimes, against, indians, the, economic, policies, of, the, east, india, company, were, also, resented, by, many, indians, each, of, the, three, presidencies, into, which, the, east, india, company, divided, india, for, administrative, purposes, maintained, their, own, armies, of, these, the, army, of, the, bengal, presidency, was, the, largest, unlike, the, other, two, it, recruited, heavily, from, among, high, caste, hindus, and, comparatively, wealthy, muslims, the, muslims, formed, a, larger, percentage, of, the, 18, irregular, cavalry, units, within, the, bengal, army, whilst, hindus, were, mainly, to, be, found, in, the, 84, regular, infantry, and, cavalry, regiments, thus, 75, of, the, cavalry, regiments, was, composed, of, indian, muslims, while, 80, of, the, infantry, was, composed, of, hindus, the, sepoys, were, therefore, affected, to, a, large, degree, by, the, concerns, of, the, landholding, and, traditional, members, of, indian, society, in, the, early, years, of, company, rule, it, tolerated, and, even, encouraged, the, caste, privileges, and, customs, within, the, bengal, army, which, recruited, its, regular, infantry, soldiers, almost, exclusively, amongst, the, landowning, rajputs, and, brahmins, of, the, bihar, and, oudh, regions, these, soldiers, were, known, as, purbiyas, by, the, time, these, customs, and, privileges, came, to, be, threatened, by, modernising, regimes, in, calcutta, from, the, 1840s, onwards, the, sepoys, had, become, accustomed, to, very, high, ritual, status, and, were, extremely, sensitive, to, suggestions, that, their, caste, might, be, polluted, the, sepoys, also, gradually, became, dissatisfied, with, various, other, aspects, of, army, life, their, pay, was, relatively, low, and, after, oudh, and, the, punjab, were, annexed, the, soldiers, no, longer, received, extra, pay, batta, or, bhatta, for, service, there, because, they, were, no, longer, considered, foreign, missions, the, junior, british, officers, became, increasingly, estranged, from, their, soldiers, in, many, cases, treating, them, as, their, racial, inferiors, in, 1856, a, new, enlistment, act, was, introduced, by, the, company, which, in, theory, made, every, unit, in, the, bengal, army, liable, to, service, overseas, although, it, was, intended, to, apply, only, to, new, recruits, the, serving, sepoys, feared, that, the, act, might, be, applied, retroactively, to, them, as, well, a, high, caste, hindu, who, travelled, in, the, cramped, conditions, of, a, wooden, troop, ship, could, not, cook, his, own, food, on, his, own, fire, and, accordingly, risked, losing, caste, through, ritual, pollution, 243, several, months, of, increasing, tensions, coupled, with, various, incidents, preceded, the, actual, rebellion, on, 26, february, 1857, the, 19th, bengal, native, infantry, bni, regiment, became, concerned, that, new, cartridges, they, had, been, issued, were, wrapped, in, paper, greased, with, cow, and, pig, fat, which, had, to, be, opened, by, mouth, thus, affecting, their, religious, sensibilities, their, colonel, confronted, them, supported, by, artillery, and, cavalry, on, the, parade, ground, but, after, some, negotiation, withdrew, the, artillery, and, cancelled, the, next, morning, s, parade, on, 29, march, 1857, at, the, barrackpore, parade, ground, near, calcutta, 29, year, old, mangal, pandey, of, the, 34th, bni, angered, by, the, recent, actions, of, the, east, india, company, declared, that, he, would, rebel, against, his, commanders, informed, about, pandey, s, behaviour, sergeant, major, james, hewson, went, to, investigate, only, to, have, pandey, shoot, at, him, hewson, raised, the, alarm, when, his, adjutant, lt, henry, baugh, came, out, to, investigate, the, unrest, pandey, opened, fire, but, hit, baugh, s, horse, instead, general, john, hearsey, came, out, to, the, parade, ground, to, investigate, and, claimed, later, that, mangal, pandey, was, in, some, kind, of, religious, frenzy, he, ordered, the, indian, commander, of, the, quarter, guard, jemadar, ishwari, prasad, to, arrest, mangal, pandey, but, the, jemadar, refused, the, quarter, guard, and, other, sepoys, present, with, the, single, exception, of, a, soldier, called, shaikh, paltu, drew, back, from, restraining, or, arresting, mangal, pandey, shaikh, paltu, restrained, pandey, from, continuing, his, attack, after, failing, to, incite, his, comrades, into, an, open, and, active, rebellion, mangal, pandey, tried, to, take, his, own, life, by, placing, his, musket, to, his, chest, and, pulling, the, trigger, with, his, toe, he, managed, only, to, wound, himself, he, was, court, martialled, on, 6, april, and, hanged, two, days, later, the, jemadar, ishwari, prasad, was, sentenced, to, death, and, hanged, on, 21, april, the, regiment, was, disbanded, and, stripped, of, its, uniforms, because, it, was, felt, that, it, harboured, ill, feelings, towards, its, superiors, particularly, after, this, incident, shaikh, paltu, was, promoted, to, the, rank, of, havildar, in, the, bengal, army, but, was, murdered, shortly, before, the, 34th, bni, dispersed, sepoys, in, other, regiments, thought, these, punishments, were, harsh, the, demonstration, of, disgrace, during, the, formal, disbanding, helped, foment, the, rebellion, in, view, of, some, historians, disgruntled, ex, sepoys, returned, home, to, awadh, with, a, desire, for, revenge, during, april, there, was, unrest, and, fires, at, agra, allahabad, and, ambala, at, ambala, in, particular, which, was, a, large, military, cantonment, where, several, units, had, been, collected, for, their, annual, musketry, practice, it, was, clear, to, general, anson, commander, in, chief, of, the, bengal, army, that, some, sort, of, rebellion, over, the, cartridges, was, imminent, despite, the, objections, of, the, civilian, governor, general, s, staff, he, agreed, to, postpone, the, musketry, practice, and, allow, a, new, drill, by, which, the, soldiers, tore, the, cartridges, with, their, fingers, rather, than, their, teeth, however, he, issued, no, general, orders, making, this, standard, practice, throughout, the, bengal, army, and, rather, than, remain, at, ambala, to, defuse, or, overawe, potential, trouble, he, then, proceeded, to, simla, the, cool, hill, station, where, many, high, officials, spent, the, summer, although, there, was, no, open, revolt, at, ambala, there, was, widespread, arson, during, late, april, barrack, buildings, especially, those, belonging, to, soldiers, who, had, used, the, enfield, cartridges, and, british, officers, bungalows, were, set, on, fire, at, meerut, a, large, military, cantonment, 2, 357, indian, sepoys, and, 2, 038, british, soldiers, were, stationed, along, with, 12, british, manned, guns, the, station, held, one, of, the, largest, concentrations, of, british, troops, in, india, and, this, was, later, to, be, cited, as, evidence, that, the, original, rising, was, a, spontaneous, outbreak, rather, than, a, pre, planned, plot, 278, although, the, state, of, unrest, within, the, bengal, army, was, well, known, on, 24, april, lieutenant, colonel, george, carmichael, smyth, the, unsympathetic, commanding, officer, of, the, 3rd, bengal, light, cavalry, which, was, composed, mainly, of, indian, muslims, ordered, 90, of, his, men, to, parade, and, perform, firing, drills, all, except, five, of, the, men, on, parade, refused, to, accept, their, cartridges, on, 9, may, the, remaining, 85, men, were, court, martialled, and, most, were, sentenced, to, 10, years, imprisonment, with, hard, labour, eleven, comparatively, young, soldiers, were, given, five, years, imprisonment, the, entire, garrison, was, paraded, and, watched, as, the, condemned, men, were, stripped, of, their, uniforms, and, placed, in, shackles, as, they, were, marched, off, to, jail, the, condemned, soldiers, berated, their, comrades, for, failing, to, support, them, the, next, day, was, sunday, some, indian, soldiers, warned, off, duty, junior, british, officers, that, plans, were, afoot, to, release, the, imprisoned, soldiers, by, force, but, the, senior, officers, to, whom, this, was, reported, took, no, action, there, was, also, unrest, in, the, city, of, meerut, itself, with, angry, protests, in, the, bazaar, and, some, buildings, being, set, on, fire, in, the, evening, most, british, officers, were, preparing, to, attend, church, while, many, of, the, british, soldiers, were, off, duty, and, had, gone, into, canteens, or, into, the, bazaar, in, meerut, the, indian, troops, led, by, the, 3rd, cavalry, broke, into, revolt, british, junior, officers, who, attempted, to, quell, the, first, outbreaks, were, killed, by, the, rebels, british, officers, and, civilians, quarters, were, attacked, and, four, civilian, men, eight, women, and, eight, children, were, killed, crowds, in, the, bazaar, attacked, off, duty, soldiers, there, about, 50, indian, civilians, some, of, them, officers, servants, who, tried, to, defend, or, conceal, their, employers, were, killed, by, the, sepoys, while, the, action, of, the, sepoys, in, freeing, their, 85, imprisoned, comrades, appears, to, have, been, spontaneous, some, civilian, rioting, in, the, city, was, reportedly, encouraged, by, kotwal, chief, police, officer, dhan, singh, gurjar, some, sepoys, especially, from, the, 11th, bengal, native, infantry, escorted, trusted, british, officers, and, women, and, children, to, safety, before, joining, the, revolt, some, officers, and, their, families, escaped, to, rampur, where, they, found, refuge, with, the, nawab, the, british, historian, philip, mason, notes, that, it, was, inevitable, that, most, of, the, sepoys, and, sowars, from, meerut, should, have, made, for, delhi, on, the, night, of, 10, may, it, was, a, strong, walled, city, located, only, forty, miles, away, it, was, the, ancient, capital, and, present, seat, of, the, nominal, mughal, emperor, and, finally, there, were, no, british, troops, in, garrison, there, in, contrast, to, meerut, 278, no, effort, was, made, to, pursue, them, early, on, 11, may, the, first, parties, of, the, 3rd, cavalry, reached, delhi, from, beneath, the, windows, of, the, emperor, s, apartments, in, the, palace, they, called, on, bahadur, shah, ii, to, acknowledge, and, lead, them, he, did, nothing, at, this, point, apparently, treating, the, sepoys, as, ordinary, petitioners, but, others, in, the, palace, were, quick, to, join, the, revolt, during, the, day, the, revolt, spread, british, officials, and, dependents, indian, christians, and, shop, keepers, within, the, city, were, killed, some, by, sepoys, and, others, by, crowds, of, rioters, 71, 73, there, were, three, battalion, sized, regiments, of, bengal, native, infantry, stationed, in, or, near, the, city, some, detachments, quickly, joined, the, rebellion, while, others, held, back, but, also, refused, to, obey, orders, to, take, action, against, the, rebels, in, the, afternoon, a, violent, explosion, in, the, city, was, heard, for, several, miles, fearing, that, the, arsenal, which, contained, large, stocks, of, arms, and, ammunition, would, fall, intact, into, rebel, hands, the, nine, british, ordnance, officers, there, had, opened, fire, on, the, sepoys, including, the, men, of, their, own, guard, when, resistance, appeared, hopeless, they, blew, up, the, arsenal, six, of, the, nine, officers, survived, but, the, blast, killed, many, in, the, streets, and, nearby, houses, and, other, buildings, the, news, of, these, events, finally, tipped, the, sepoys, stationed, around, delhi, into, open, rebellion, the, sepoys, were, later, able, to, salvage, at, least, some, arms, from, the, arsenal, and, a, magazine, two, miles, 3, km, 1, 9, mi, outside, delhi, containing, up, to, 3, 000, barrels, of, gunpowder, was, captured, without, resistance, many, fugitive, british, officers, and, civilians, had, congregated, at, the, flagstaff, tower, on, the, ridge, north, of, delhi, where, telegraph, operators, were, sending, news, of, the, events, to, other, british, stations, when, it, became, clear, that, the, help, expected, from, meerut, was, not, coming, they, made, their, way, in, carriages, to, karnal, those, who, became, separated, from, the, main, body, or, who, could, not, reach, the, flagstaff, tower, also, set, out, for, karnal, on, foot, some, were, helped, by, villagers, on, the, way, others, were, killed, the, next, day, bahadur, shah, held, his, first, formal, court, for, many, years, it, was, attended, by, many, excited, sepoys, the, emperor, was, alarmed, by, the, turn, events, had, taken, but, eventually, accepted, the, sepoys, allegiance, and, agreed, to, give, his, countenance, to, the, rebellion, on, 16, may, up, to, 50, british, who, had, been, held, prisoner, in, the, palace, or, had, been, discovered, hiding, in, the, city, were, killed, by, some, of, the, emperor, s, servants, under, a, peepul, tree, in, a, courtyard, outside, the, palace, the, news, of, the, events, at, meerut, and, delhi, spread, rapidly, provoking, uprisings, among, sepoys, and, disturbances, in, many, districts, in, many, cases, it, was, the, behaviour, of, british, military, and, civilian, authorities, themselves, which, precipitated, disorder, learning, of, the, fall, of, delhi, many, company, administrators, hastened, to, remove, themselves, their, families, and, servants, to, places, of, safety, at, agra, 160, miles, 260, km, from, delhi, no, fewer, than, 6, 000, assorted, non, combatants, converged, on, the, fort, the, military, authorities, also, reacted, in, disjointed, manner, some, officers, trusted, their, sepoys, but, others, tried, to, disarm, them, to, forestall, potential, uprisings, at, benares, and, allahabad, the, disarmings, were, bungled, also, leading, to, local, revolts, 52, 53, in, 1857, the, bengal, army, had, 86, 000, men, of, which, 12, 000, were, british, 16, 000, sikh, and, 1, 500, gurkha, there, were, 311, 000, native, soldiers, in, india, altogether, 40, 160, british, soldiers, including, units, of, the, british, army, and, 5, 362, officers, fifty, four, of, the, bengal, army, s, 74, regular, native, infantry, regiments, mutinied, but, some, were, immediately, destroyed, or, broke, up, with, their, sepoys, drifting, away, to, their, homes, a, number, of, the, remaining, 20, regiments, were, disarmed, or, disbanded, to, prevent, or, forestall, mutiny, only, twelve, of, the, original, bengal, native, infantry, regiments, survived, to, pass, into, the, new, indian, army, all, ten, of, the, bengal, light, cavalry, regiments, mutinied, the, bengal, army, also, contained, 29, irregular, cavalry, and, 42, irregular, infantry, regiments, of, these, a, substantial, contingent, from, the, recently, annexed, state, of, awadh, mutinied, en, masse, another, large, contingent, from, gwalior, also, mutinied, even, though, that, state, s, king, jayajirao, scindia, supported, the, british, the, remainder, of, the, irregular, units, were, raised, from, a, wide, variety, of, sources, and, were, less, affected, by, the, concerns, of, mainstream, indian, society, some, irregular, units, actively, supported, the, company, three, gurkha, and, five, of, six, sikh, infantry, units, and, the, six, infantry, and, six, cavalry, units, of, the, recently, raised, punjab, irregular, force, on, 1, april, 1858, the, number, of, indian, soldiers, in, the, bengal, army, loyal, to, the, company, was, 80, 053, however, large, numbers, were, hastily, raised, in, the, punjab, and, north, west, frontier, after, the, outbreak, of, the, rebellion, the, bombay, army, had, three, mutinies, in, its, 29, regiments, whilst, the, madras, army, had, none, at, all, although, elements, of, one, of, its, 52, regiments, refused, to, volunteer, for, service, in, bengal, nonetheless, most, of, southern, india, remained, passive, with, only, intermittent, outbreaks, of, violence, many, parts, of, the, region, were, ruled, by, the, nizams, or, the, mysore, royalty, and, were, thus, not, directly, under, british, rule, although, most, of, the, mutinous, sepoys, in, delhi, were, hindus, a, significant, proportion, of, the, insurgents, were, muslims, the, proportion, of, ghazis, grew, to, be, about, a, quarter, of, the, local, fighting, force, by, the, end, of, the, siege, and, included, a, regiment, of, suicide, ghazis, from, gwalior, who, had, vowed, never, to, eat, again, and, to, fight, until, they, met, certain, death, at, the, hands, of, british, troops, however, most, muslims, did, not, share, the, rebels, dislike, of, the, british, administration, and, their, ulema, could, not, agree, on, whether, to, declare, a, jihad, some, islamic, scholars, such, as, maulana, muhammad, qasim, nanautavi, and, maulana, rashid, ahmad, gangohi, took, up, arms, against, the, colonial, rule, but, many, muslims, among, them, ulema, from, both, the, sunni, and, shia, sects, sided, with, the, british, various, ahl, i, hadith, scholars, and, colleagues, of, nanautavi, rejected, the, jihad, the, most, influential, member, of, ahl, i, hadith, ulema, in, delhi, maulana, sayyid, nazir, husain, dehlvi, resisted, pressure, from, the, mutineers, to, call, for, a, jihad, and, instead, declared, in, favour, of, british, rule, viewing, the, muslim, british, relationship, as, a, legal, contract, which, could, not, be, broken, unless, their, religious, rights, were, breached, the, sikhs, and, pathans, of, the, punjab, and, north, west, frontier, province, supported, the, british, and, helped, in, the, recapture, of, delhi, the, sikhs, in, particular, feared, reinstatement, of, mughal, rule, in, northern, india, because, they, had, been, persecuted, by, the, mughal, empire, they, also, felt, disdain, towards, the, purbiyas, or, easterners, biharis, and, those, from, the, united, provinces, of, agra, and, oudh, in, the, bengal, army, the, sikhs, felt, that, the, bloodiest, battles, of, the, first, and, second, anglo, sikh, wars, chillianwala, and, ferozeshah, had, been, won, by, british, troops, while, the, hindustani, sepoys, had, refused, to, meet, the, sikhs, in, battle, these, feelings, were, compounded, when, hindustani, sepoys, were, assigned, a, very, visible, role, as, garrison, troops, in, punjab, and, awarded, profit, making, civil, posts, in, the, punjab, the, varied, groups, in, the, support, and, opposing, of, the, uprising, is, seen, as, a, major, cause, of, its, failure, bahadur, shah, ii, was, proclaimed, the, emperor, of, the, whole, of, india, most, contemporary, and, modern, accounts, suggest, that, he, was, coerced, by, the, sepoys, and, his, courtiers, to, sign, the, proclamation, against, his, will, in, spite, of, the, significant, loss, of, power, that, the, mughal, dynasty, had, suffered, in, the, preceding, centuries, their, name, still, carried, great, prestige, across, northern, india, civilians, nobility, and, other, dignitaries, took, an, oath, of, allegiance, the, emperor, issued, coins, in, his, name, one, of, the, oldest, ways, of, asserting, imperial, status, the, adhesion, of, the, mughal, emperor, however, turned, the, sikhs, of, the, punjab, away, from, the, rebellion, as, they, did, not, want, to, return, to, islamic, rule, having, fought, many, wars, against, the, mughal, rulers, the, province, of, bengal, was, largely, quiet, throughout, the, entire, period, the, british, who, had, long, ceased, to, take, the, authority, of, the, mughal, emperor, seriously, were, astonished, at, how, the, ordinary, people, responded, to, bahadur, shah, s, call, for, war, initially, the, indian, rebels, were, able, to, push, back, company, forces, and, captured, several, important, towns, in, haryana, bihar, the, central, provinces, and, the, united, provinces, when, british, troops, were, reinforced, and, began, to, counterattack, the, mutineers, were, especially, handicapped, by, their, lack, of, centralized, command, and, control, although, the, rebels, produced, some, natural, leaders, such, as, bakht, khan, whom, the, emperor, later, nominated, as, commander, in, chief, after, his, son, mirza, mughal, proved, ineffectual, for, the, most, part, they, were, forced, to, look, for, leadership, to, rajahs, and, princes, some, of, these, were, to, prove, dedicated, leaders, but, others, were, self, interested, or, inept, in, the, countryside, around, meerut, a, general, gurjar, uprising, posed, the, largest, threat, to, the, british, in, parikshitgarh, near, meerut, gurjars, declared, rao, kadam, singh, kuddum, singh, their, leader, and, expelled, company, police, kadam, singh, gurjar, led, a, large, force, estimates, varying, from, 2, 000, to, 10, 000, bulandshahr, and, bijnor, also, came, under, the, control, of, gurjars, under, walidad, khan, and, maho, singh, respectively, contemporary, sources, report, that, nearly, all, the, gurjar, villages, between, meerut, and, delhi, participated, in, the, revolt, in, some, cases, with, support, from, jullundur, and, it, was, not, until, late, july, that, with, the, help, of, local, jats, and, the, princely, states, the, british, managed, to, regain, control, of, the, area, the, imperial, gazetteer, of, india, states, that, throughout, the, indian, rebellion, of, 1857, gurjars, and, ranghars, proved, the, most, irreconcilable, enemies, of, the, british, in, the, bulandshahr, area, mufti, nizamuddin, a, renowned, scholar, of, lahore, issued, a, fatwa, against, the, british, forces, and, called, upon, the, local, population, to, support, the, forces, of, rao, tula, ram, casualties, were, high, at, the, subsequent, engagement, at, narnaul, nasibpur, after, the, defeat, of, rao, tula, ram, on, 16, november, 1857, mufti, nizamuddin, was, arrested, and, his, brother, mufti, yaqinuddin, and, brother, in, law, abdur, rahman, alias, nabi, baksh, were, arrested, in, tijara, they, were, taken, to, delhi, and, hanged, the, british, were, slow, to, strike, back, at, first, it, took, time, for, troops, stationed, in, britain, to, make, their, way, to, india, by, sea, although, some, regiments, moved, overland, through, persia, from, the, crimean, war, and, some, regiments, already, en, route, for, china, were, diverted, to, india, it, took, time, to, organise, the, british, troops, already, in, india, into, field, forces, but, eventually, two, columns, left, meerut, and, simla, they, proceeded, slowly, towards, delhi, and, fought, killed, and, hanged, numerous, indians, along, the, way, two, months, after, the, first, outbreak, of, rebellion, at, meerut, the, two, forces, met, near, karnal, the, combined, force, including, two, gurkha, units, serving, in, the, bengal, army, under, contract, from, the, kingdom, of, nepal, fought, the, rebels, main, army, at, badli, ke, serai, and, drove, them, back, to, delhi, the, company, s, army, established, a, base, on, the, delhi, ridge, to, the, north, of, the, city, and, the, siege, of, delhi, began, the, siege, lasted, roughly, from, 1, july, to, 21, september, however, the, encirclement, was, hardly, complete, and, for, much, of, the, siege, the, besiegers, were, outnumbered, and, it, often, seemed, that, it, was, the, company, forces, and, not, delhi, that, were, under, siege, as, the, rebels, could, easily, receive, resources, and, reinforcements, for, several, weeks, it, seemed, likely, that, disease, exhaustion, and, continuous, sorties, by, rebels, from, delhi, would, force, the, besiegers, to, withdraw, but, the, outbreaks, of, rebellion, in, the, punjab, were, forestalled, or, suppressed, allowing, the, punjab, movable, column, of, british, sikh, and, pashtun, soldiers, under, john, nicholson, to, reinforce, the, besiegers, on, the, ridge, on, 14, august, on, 30, august, the, rebels, offered, terms, which, were, refused, an, eagerly, awaited, heavy, siege, train, joined, the, besieging, force, and, from, 7, september, the, siege, guns, battered, breaches, in, the, walls, and, silenced, the, rebels, artillery, 478, an, attempt, to, storm, the, city, through, the, breaches, and, the, kashmiri, gate, was, launched, on, 14, september, 480, the, attackers, gained, a, foothold, within, the, city, but, suffered, heavy, casualties, including, john, nicholson, major, general, archdale, wilson, the, british, commander, wished, to, withdraw, but, was, persuaded, to, hold, on, by, his, junior, officers, after, a, week, of, street, fighting, the, british, reached, the, red, fort, bahadur, shah, zafar, had, already, fled, to, humayun, s, tomb, the, troops, of, the, besieging, force, proceeded, to, loot, and, pillage, the, city, a, large, number, of, citizens, were, killed, in, retaliation, for, the, british, and, indian, civilians, that, had, been, slaughtered, by, the, rebels, during, the, street, fighting, artillery, was, set, up, in, the, city, s, main, mosque, neighbourhoods, within, range, were, bombarded, the, homes, of, the, muslim, nobility, that, housed, innumerable, cultural, artistic, literary, and, monetary, riches, were, destroyed, the, british, soon, arrested, bahadur, shah, zafar, and, the, next, day, the, british, major, william, hodson, had, his, sons, mirza, mughal, and, mirza, khizr, sultan, and, grandson, mirza, abu, bakr, shot, under, his, own, authority, at, the, khooni, darwaza, the, bloody, gate, near, delhi, gate, on, hearing, the, news, zafar, reacted, with, shocked, silence, while, his, wife, zinat, mahal, was, content, as, she, believed, her, son, was, now, zafar, s, heir, shortly, after, the, fall, of, delhi, the, victorious, attackers, organised, a, column, that, relieved, another, besieged, company, force, in, agra, and, then, pressed, on, to, cawnpore, which, had, also, recently, been, retaken, this, gave, the, company, forces, a, continuous, although, still, tenuous, line, of, communication, from, the, east, to, the, west, of, india, in, june, sepoys, under, general, wheeler, in, cawnpore, now, kanpur, rebelled, and, besieged, the, british, entrenchment, wheeler, was, not, only, a, veteran, and, respected, soldier, but, also, married, to, an, indian, woman, he, had, relied, on, his, own, prestige, and, his, cordial, relations, with, local, landholder, and, hereditary, prime, minister, nana, sahib, to, thwart, rebellion, and, took, comparatively, few, measures, to, prepare, fortifications, and, lay, in, supplies, and, ammunition, advised, by, his, trusted, consultant, azimullah, khan, nana, sahib, led, the, rebels, at, kanpur, rather, than, join, the, mughals, in, delhi, the, besieged, endured, three, weeks, of, the, siege, of, cawnpore, with, little, water, or, food, suffering, continuous, casualties, among, men, women, and, children, on, 25, june, nana, sahib, made, an, offer, of, safe, passage, to, allahabad, with, barely, three, days, food, rations, remaining, the, british, agreed, provided, they, could, keep, their, small, arms, and, that, the, evacuation, should, take, place, in, daylight, on, the, morning, of, the, 27th, the, nana, sahib, wanted, the, evacuation, to, take, place, on, the, night, of, the, 26th, early, in, the, morning, of, 27, june, the, british, party, left, their, entrenchment, and, made, their, way, to, the, river, where, boats, provided, by, the, nana, sahib, were, waiting, to, take, them, to, allahabad, several, sepoys, who, had, stayed, loyal, to, the, company, were, removed, by, the, mutineers, and, killed, either, because, of, their, loyalty, or, because, they, had, become, christian, a, few, injured, british, officers, trailing, the, column, were, also, apparently, hacked, to, death, by, angry, sepoys, after, the, british, party, had, largely, arrived, at, the, dock, which, was, surrounded, by, sepoys, positioned, on, both, banks, of, the, ganges, with, clear, lines, of, fire, firing, broke, out, and, the, boats, were, abandoned, by, their, crew, and, caught, or, were, set, on, fire, using, pieces, of, red, hot, charcoal, the, british, party, tried, to, push, the, boats, off, but, all, except, three, remained, stuck, one, boat, with, over, a, dozen, wounded, men, initially, escaped, but, later, grounded, was, caught, by, mutineers, and, pushed, back, down, the, river, towards, the, carnage, at, cawnpore, towards, the, end, rebel, cavalry, rode, into, the, water, to, finish, off, any, survivors, after, the, firing, ceased, the, survivors, were, rounded, up, and, the, men, shot, by, the, time, the, massacre, was, over, most, of, the, male, members, of, the, party, were, dead, while, the, surviving, women, and, children, were, removed, and, held, hostage, to, be, later, killed, in, the, bibighar, massacre, only, four, men, eventually, escaped, alive, from, cawnpore, on, one, of, the, boats, two, private, soldiers, a, lieutenant, and, captain, mowbray, thomson, who, wrote, a, first, hand, account, of, his, experiences, entitled, the, story, of, cawnpore, london, 1859, during, his, trial, tatya, tope, denied, the, existence, of, any, such, plan, and, described, the, incident, in, the, following, terms, the, british, had, already, boarded, the, boats, and, tatya, tope, raised, his, right, hand, to, signal, their, departure, that, very, moment, someone, from, the, crowd, blew, a, loud, bugle, which, created, disorder, and, in, the, ongoing, bewilderment, the, boatmen, jumped, off, the, boats, the, rebels, started, shooting, indiscriminately, nana, sahib, who, was, staying, in, savada, kothi, bungalow, nearby, was, informed, about, what, was, happening, and, immediately, came, to, stop, it, some, british, histories, allow, that, it, might, well, have, been, the, result, of, accident, or, error, someone, accidentally, or, maliciously, fired, a, shot, the, panic, stricken, british, opened, fire, and, it, became, impossible, to, stop, the, massacre, 56, the, surviving, women, and, children, were, taken, to, nana, sahib, and, then, confined, first, to, the, savada, kothi, and, then, to, the, home, of, the, local, magistrate, s, clerk, the, bibighar, where, they, were, joined, by, refugees, from, fatehgarh, overall, five, men, and, 206, women, and, children, were, confined, in, the, bibigarh, for, about, two, weeks, in, one, week, 25, were, brought, out, dead, from, dysentery, and, cholera, meanwhile, a, company, relief, force, that, had, advanced, from, allahabad, defeated, the, indians, and, by, 15, july, it, was, clear, that, nana, sahib, would, not, be, able, to, hold, cawnpore, and, a, decision, was, made, by, nana, sahib, and, other, leading, rebels, that, the, hostages, must, be, killed, after, the, sepoys, refused, to, carry, out, this, order, two, muslim, butchers, two, hindu, peasants, and, one, of, nana, s, bodyguards, went, into, the, bibigarh, armed, with, knives, and, hatchets, they, murdered, the, women, and, children, after, the, massacre, the, walls, were, covered, in, bloody, handprints, and, the, floor, littered, with, parts, of, human, limbs, the, dead, and, the, dying, were, thrown, down, a, nearby, well, when, the, 50, foot, 15, m, deep, well, was, filled, with, remains, to, within, 6, feet, 1, 8, m, of, the, top, the, remainder, were, thrown, into, the, ganges, historians, have, given, many, reasons, for, this, act, of, cruelty, with, company, forces, approaching, cawnpore, some, believed, that, they, would, not, advance, if, there, were, no, hostages, to, save, or, perhaps, it, was, to, ensure, that, no, information, was, leaked, after, the, fall, of, cawnpore, other, historians, have, suggested, that, the, killings, were, an, attempt, to, undermine, nana, sahib, s, relationship, with, the, british, perhaps, it, was, due, to, fear, the, fear, of, being, recognised, by, some, of, the, prisoners, for, having, taken, part, in, the, earlier, firings, the, killing, of, the, women, and, children, hardened, british, attitudes, against, the, sepoys, the, british, public, was, aghast, and, the, anti, imperial, and, pro, indian, proponents, lost, all, of, their, support, cawnpore, became, a, war, cry, for, the, british, and, their, allies, for, the, rest, of, the, conflict, nana, sahib, disappeared, near, the, end, of, the, rebellion, and, it, is, not, known, what, happened, to, him, other, british, accounts, state, that, indiscriminate, punitive, measures, were, taken, in, early, june, two, weeks, before, the, murders, at, the, bibighar, but, after, those, at, both, meerut, and, delhi, specifically, by, lieutenant, colonel, james, george, smith, neill, of, the, madras, fusiliers, commanding, at, allahabad, while, moving, towards, cawnpore, at, the, nearby, town, of, fatehpur, a, mob, had, attacked, and, murdered, the, local, british, population, on, this, pretext, neill, ordered, all, villages, beside, the, grand, trunk, road, to, be, burned, and, their, inhabitants, to, be, hanged, neill, s, methods, were, ruthless, and, horrible, 53, and, far, from, intimidating, the, population, may, well, have, induced, previously, undecided, sepoys, and, communities, to, revolt, neill, was, killed, in, action, at, lucknow, on, 26, september, and, was, never, called, to, account, for, his, punitive, measures, though, contemporary, british, sources, lionised, him, and, his, gallant, blue, caps, when, the, british, retook, cawnpore, the, soldiers, took, their, sepoy, prisoners, to, the, bibighar, and, forced, them, to, lick, the, bloodstains, from, the, walls, and, floor, they, then, hanged, or, blew, from, the, cannon, the, traditional, mughal, punishment, for, mutiny, the, majority, of, the, sepoy, prisoners, although, some, claimed, the, sepoys, took, no, actual, part, in, the, killings, themselves, they, did, not, act, to, stop, it, and, this, was, acknowledged, by, captain, thompson, after, the, british, departed, cawnpore, for, a, second, time, very, soon, after, the, events, at, meerut, rebellion, erupted, in, the, state, of, awadh, also, known, as, oudh, in, modern, day, uttar, pradesh, which, had, been, annexed, barely, a, year, before, the, british, commissioner, resident, at, lucknow, sir, henry, lawrence, had, enough, time, to, fortify, his, position, inside, the, residency, compound, the, defenders, including, loyal, sepoys, numbered, some, 1700, men, the, rebels, assaults, were, unsuccessful, so, they, began, a, barrage, of, artillery, and, musket, fire, into, the, compound, lawrence, was, one, of, the, first, casualties, he, was, succeeded, by, john, eardley, inglis, the, rebels, tried, to, breach, the, walls, with, explosives, and, bypass, them, via, tunnels, that, led, to, underground, close, combat, 486, after, 90, days, of, siege, the, defenders, were, reduced, to, 300, loyal, sepoys, 350, british, soldiers, and, 550, non, combatants, on, 25, september, a, relief, column, under, the, command, of, sir, henry, havelock, and, accompanied, by, sir, james, outram, who, in, theory, was, his, superior, fought, its, way, from, cawnpore, to, lucknow, in, a, brief, campaign, in, which, the, numerically, small, column, defeated, rebel, forces, in, a, series, of, increasingly, large, battles, this, became, known, as, the, first, relief, of, lucknow, as, this, force, was, not, strong, enough, to, break, the, siege, or, extricate, themselves, and, so, was, forced, to, join, the, garrison, in, october, another, larger, army, under, the, new, commander, in, chief, sir, colin, campbell, was, finally, able, to, relieve, the, garrison, and, on, 18, november, they, evacuated, the, defended, enclave, within, the, city, the, women, and, children, leaving, first, they, then, conducted, an, orderly,

to, recapture, the, city, in, the, second, battle, of, cawnpore, in, march, 1858, campbell, once, again, advanced, on, lucknow, with, a, large, army, meeting, up, with, the, force, at, alambagh, this, time, seeking, to, suppress, the, rebellion, in, awadh, he, was, aided, by, a, large, nepalese, contingent, advancing, from, the, north, under, jung, bahadur, kunwar, rana, general, dhir, shamsher,

methodical, with, a, force, under, general, outram, crossing, the, river, on, cask, bridges, on, 4, march, to, enable, them, to, fire, artillery, in, flank, campbell, drove, the, large, but, disorganised, rebel, army, from, lucknow, with, the, final, fighting, taking, place, on, 21, march, 491, there, were, few, casualties, to, campbell, s, own, troops, but, his, cautious, movements,

in, 1849, in, 1857, the, region, still, contained, the, highest, numbers, of, both, british, and, indian, troops, the, inhabitants, of, the, punjab, were, not, as, sympathetic, to, the, sepoys, as, they, were, elsewhere, in, india, which, limited, many, of, the, outbreaks, in, the, punjab, to, disjointed, uprisings, by, regiments, of, sepoys, isolated, from, each, other, in, some, garrisons, notably, ferozepore, indecision, on, the, part, of, the, senior, british, officers, allowed, the, sepoys, to, rebel, but, the, sepoys, then, left, the, area, mostly, heading, for, delhi, at, the, most, important, garrison, that, of, peshawar, close, to, the, afghan, frontier, many, comparatively, junior, officers, ignored, their, nominal, commander, general, reed, and, took, decisive, action, they, intercepted, the, sepoys, mail, thus, preventing, their, coordinating, an, uprising, and, formed, a, force, known, as, the, punjab, movable, column, to, move, rapidly, to, suppress, any, revolts, as, they, occurred, when, it, became, clear, from, the, intercepted, correspondence, that, some, of, the, sepoys, at, peshawar, were, on, the, point, of, open, revolt, the, four, most, disaffected, bengal, native, regiments, were, disarmed, by, the, two, british, infantry, regiments, in, the, cantonment, backed, by, artillery, on, 22, may, this, decisive, act, induced, many, local,

an, equal, british, force, as, they, tried, to, cross, the, ravi, river, after, fighting, steadily, but, unsuccessfully, for, several, hours, the, sepoys, tried, to, fall, back, across, the, river, but, became, trapped, on, an, island, three, days, later, nicholson, annihilated, the, 1, 100, trapped, sepoys, in, the, battle, of, trimmu, ghat, 290, 293, the, british, had, been, recruiting,

troops, entered, were, bayoneted, on, the, spot, and, the, number, was, considerable, as, you, may, suppose, when, i, tell, you, that, in, some, houses, forty, and, fifty, people, were, hiding, these, were, not, mutineers, but, residents, of, the, city, who, trusted, to, our, well, known, mild, rule, for, pardon, i, am, glad, to, say, they, were, disappointed, from, the, end, of, 1857, the, british, had, begun, to, gain, ground, again, lucknow, was, retaken, in, march, 1858, on, 8, july, 1858, a, peace, treaty, was, signed, and, the, rebellion, ended, the, last, rebels, were, defeated, in, gwalior, on, 20, june, 1858, by, 1859, rebel, leaders, bakht, khan, and, nana, sahib, had, either, been, slain, or, had, fled, edward, vibart, a, 19, year, old, officer, whose, parents, younger, brothers, and, two, of, his, sisters, had, died, in, the, cawnpore, massacre, recorded, his, experience, the, orders, went, out, to, shoot, every, soul, it, was, literally, murder, i, have, seen, many, bloody, and, awful, sights, lately, but, such, a, one, as, i, witnessed, yesterday, i, pray, i, never, see, again, the, women, were, all, spared, but, their, screams, on, seeing, their, husbands, and, sons, butchered, were, most, painful, heaven, knows, i, feel, no, pity, but, when, some, old, grey, bearded, man, is, brought, and, shot, before, your, very, eyes, hard, must, be, that, man, s, heart, i, think, who, can, look, on, with, indifference, some, british, troops, adopted, a, policy, of, no, prisoners, one, officer, thomas, lowe, remembered, how, on, one, occasion, his, unit, had, taken, 76, prisoners, they, were, just, too, tired, to, carry, on, killing, and, needed, a, rest, he, recalled, later, after, a, quick, trial, the, prisoners, were, lined, up, with, a, british, soldier, standing, a, couple, of, yards, in, front, of, them, on, the, order, fire, they, were, all, simultaneously, shot, swept, from, their, earthly, existence, the, aftermath, of, the, rebellion, has, been, the, focus, of, new, work, using, indian, sources, and, population, studies, in, the, last, mughal, historian, william, dalrymple, examines, the, effects, on, the, muslim, population, of, delhi, after, the, city, was, retaken, by, the, british, and, finds, that, intellectual, and, economic, control, of, the, city, shifted, from, muslim, to, hindu, hands, because, the, british, at, that, time, saw, an, islamic, hand, behind, the, mutiny, approximately, 6, 000, of, the, 40, 000, british, living, in, india, were, killed, the, scale, of, the, punishments, handed, out, by, the, british, army, of, retribution, was, considered, largely, appropriate, and, justified, in, a, britain, shocked, by, embellished, reports, of, atrocities, carried, out, against, british, troops, and, civilians, by, the, rebels, accounts, of, the, time, frequently, reach, the, hyperbolic, register, according, to, christopher, herbert, especially, in, the, often, repeated, claim, that, the, red, year, of, 1857, marked, a, terrible, break, in, british, experience, such, was, the, atmosphere, a, national, mood, of, retribution, and, despair, that, led, to, almost, universal, approval, of, the, measures, taken, to, pacify, the, revolt, 87, incidents, of, rape, allegedly, committed, by, indian, rebels, against, british, women, and, girls, appalled, the, british, public, these, atrocities, were, often, used, to, justify, the, british, reaction, to, the, rebellion, british, newspapers, printed, various, eyewitness, accounts, of, the, rape, of, english, women, and, girls, one, such, account, was, published, by, the, times, regarding, an, incident, where, 48, english, girls, as, young, as, 10, had, been, raped, by, indian, rebels, in, delhi, karl, marx, criticized, this, story, as, false, propaganda, and, pointed, out, that, the, story, was, written, by, a, clergyman, in, bangalore, far, from, the, events, of, the, rebellion, with, no, evidence, to, support, his, allegation, individual, incidents, captured, the, public, s, interest, and, were, heavily, reported, by, the, press, one, such, incident, was, that, of, general, wheeler, s, daughter, margaret, being, forced, to, live, as, her, captor, s, concubine, though, this, was, reported, to, the, victorian, public, as, margaret, killing, her, rapist, then, herself, another, version, of, the, story, suggested, that, margaret, had, been, killed, after, her, abductor, had, argued, with, his, wife, over, her, during, the, aftermath, of, the, rebellion, a, series, of, exhaustive, investigations, were, carried, out, by, british, police, and, intelligence, officials, into, reports, that, british, women, prisoners, had, been, dishonoured, at, the, bibighar, and, elsewhere, one, such, detailed, enquiry, was, at, the, direction, of, lord, canning, the, consensus, was, that, there, was, no, convincing, evidence, of, such, crimes, having, been, committed, although, numbers, of, british, women, and, children, had, been, killed, outright, the, term, sepoy, or, sepoyism, became, a, derogatory, term, for, nationalists, especially, in, ireland, bahadur, shah, ii, was, arrested, at, humayun, s, tomb, and, tried, for, treason, by, a, military, commission, assembled, at, delhi, and, exiled, to, rangoon, where, he, died, in, 1862, bringing, the, mughal, dynasty, to, an, end, in, 1877, queen, victoria, took, the, title, of, empress, of, india, on, the, advice, of, prime, minister, benjamin, disraeli, the, rebellion, saw, the, end, of, the, east, india, company, s, rule, in, india, in, august, by, the, government, of, india, act, 1858, the, company, s, ruling, powers, over, india, were, transferred, to, the, british, crown, a, new, british, government, department, the, india, office, was, created, to, handle, the, governance, of, india, and, its, head, the, secretary, of, state, for, india, was, entrusted, with, formulating, indian, policy, the, governor, general, of, india, gained, a, new, title, viceroy, of, india, and, implemented, the, policies, devised, by, the, india, office, some, former, east, india, company, territories, such, as, the, straits, settlements, became, colonies, in, their, own, right, the, british, colonial, administration, embarked, on, a, program, of, reform, trying, to, integrate, indian, higher, castes, and, rulers, into, the, government, and, abolishing, attempts, at, westernization, the, viceroy, stopped, land, grabs, decreed, religious, tolerance, and, admitted, indians, into, civil, service, albeit, mainly, as, subordinates, essentially, the, old, east, india, company, bureaucracy, remained, though, there, was, a, major, shift, in, attitudes, in, looking, for, the, causes, of, the, rebellion, the, authorities, alighted, on, two, things, religion, and, the, economy, on, religion, it, was, felt, that, there, had, been, too, much, interference, with, indigenous, traditions, both, hindu, and, muslim, on, the, economy, it, was, now, believed, that, the, previous, attempts, by, the, company, to, introduce, free, market, competition, had, undermined, traditional, power, structures, and, bonds, of, loyalty, placing, the, peasantry, at, the, mercy, of, merchants, and, moneylenders, in, consequence, the, new, british, raj, was, constructed, in, part, around, a, conservative, agenda, based, on, a, preservation, of, tradition, and, hierarchy, on, a, political, level, it, was, also, felt, that, the, previous, lack, of, consultation, between, rulers, and, ruled, had, been, another, significant, factor, in, contributing, to, the, uprising, in, consequence, indians, were, drawn, into, government, at, a, local, level, though, this, was, on, a, limited, scale, a, crucial, precedent, had, been, set, with, the, creation, of, a, new, white, collar, indian, elite, further, stimulated, by, the, opening, of, universities, at, calcutta, bombay, and, madras, a, result, of, the, indian, universities, act, so, alongside, the, values, of, traditional, and, ancient, india, a, new, professional, middle, class, was, starting, to, arise, in, no, way, bound, by, the, values, of, the, past, their, ambition, can, only, have, been, stimulated, by, queen, victoria, s, proclamation, of, november, 1858, in, which, it, is, expressly, stated, we, hold, ourselves, bound, to, the, natives, of, our, indian, territories, by, the, same, obligations, of, duty, which, bind, us, to, our, other, subjects, it, is, our, further, will, that, our, subjects, of, whatever, race, or, creed, be, freely, and, impartially, admitted, to, offices, in, our, service, the, duties, of, which, they, may, be, qualified, by, their, education, ability, and, integrity, duly, to, discharge, acting, on, these, sentiments, lord, ripon, viceroy, from, 1880, to, 1885, extended, the, powers, of, local, self, government, and, sought, to, remove, racial, practices, in, the, law, courts, by, the, ilbert, bill, but, a, policy, at, once, liberal, and, progressive, at, one, turn, was, reactionary, and, backward, at, the, next, creating, new, elites, and, confirming, old, attitudes, the, ilbert, bill, had, the, effect, only, of, causing, a, white, mutiny, and, the, end, of, the, prospect, of, perfect, equality, before, the, law, in, 1886, measures, were, adopted, to, restrict, indian, entry, into, the, civil, service, the, bengal, army, dominated, the, presidency, armies, before, 1857, and, a, direct, result, after, the, rebellion, was, the, scaling, back, of, the, size, of, the, bengali, contingent, in, the, army, the, brahmin, presence, in, the, bengal, army, was, reduced, because, of, their, perceived, primary, role, as, mutineers, the, british, looked, for, increased, recruitment, in, the, punjab, for, the, bengal, army, as, a, result, of, the, apparent, discontent, that, resulted, in, the, sepoy, conflict, the, rebellion, transformed, both, the, native, and, british, armies, of, british, india, of, the, 74, regular, bengal, native, infantry, regiments, in, existence, at, the, beginning, of, 1857, only, twelve, escaped, mutiny, or, disbandment, all, ten, of, the, bengal, light, cavalry, regiments, were, lost, the, old, bengal, army, had, accordingly, almost, completely, vanished, from, the, order, of, battle, these, troops, were, replaced, by, new, units, recruited, from, castes, hitherto, under, utilised, by, the, british, and, from, the, minority, so, called, martial, races, such, as, the, sikhs, and, the, gurkhas, the, inefficiencies, of, the, old, organisation, which, had, estranged, sepoys, from, their, british, officers, were, addressed, and, the, post, 1857, units, were, mainly, organised, on, the, irregular, system, from, 1797, until, the, rebellion, of, 1857, each, regular, bengal, native, infantry, regiment, had, had, 22, or, 23, british, officers, 238, who, held, every, position, of, authority, down, to, the, second, in, command, of, each, company, in, irregular, units, there, were, fewer, british, officers, but, they, associated, themselves, far, more, closely, with, their, soldiers, while, more, responsibility, was, given, to, the, indian, officers, the, british, increased, the, ratio, of, british, to, indian, soldiers, within, india, from, 1861, indian, artillery, was, replaced, by, british, units, except, for, a, few, mountain, batteries, 319, the, post, rebellion, changes, formed, the, basis, of, the, military, organisation, of, british, india, until, the, early, 20th, century, medals, were, awarded, to, members, of, the, british, armed, forces, and, the, british, indian, army, during, the, rebellion, the, 182, recipients, of, the, victoria, cross, are, listed, here, 290, 000, indian, mutiny, medals, were, awarded, clasps, were, awarded, for, the, siege, of, delhi, and, the, siege, and, relief, of, lucknow, a, military, and, civilian, decoration, of, british, india, the, indian, order, of, merit, was, first, introduced, by, the, east, india, company, in, 1837, and, was, taken, over, by, the, crown, in, 1858, following, the, indian, mutiny, of, 1857, the, indian, order, of, merit, was, the, only, gallantry, medal, available, to, native, soldiers, between, 1837, and, 1907, there, is, no, universally, agreed, name, for, the, events, of, this, period, in, india, and, pakistan, it, has, been, termed, as, the, war, of, independence, of, 1857, or, first, war, of, indian, independence, but, it, is, not, uncommon, to, use, terms, such, as, the, revolt, of, 1857, the, classification, of, the, rebellion, being, first, war, of, independence, is, not, without, its, critics, in, india, the, use, of, the, term, indian, mutiny, is, considered, by, some, indian, politicians, as, belittling, the, importance, of, what, happened, and, therefore, reflecting, an, imperialistic, attitude, others, dispute, this, interpretation, in, the, uk, and, parts, of, the, commonwealth, it, is, commonly, called, the, indian, mutiny, but, terms, such, as, great, indian, mutiny, the, sepoy, mutiny, the, sepoy, rebellion, the, sepoy, war, the, great, mutiny, the, rebellion, of, 1857, the, uprising, the, mahomedan, rebellion, and, the, revolt, of, 1857, have, also, been, used, the, indian, insurrection, was, a, name, used, in, the, press, of, the, uk, and, british, colonies, at, the, time, michael, adas, 1971, examines, the, historiography, with, emphasis, on, the, four, major, approaches, the, indian, nationalist, view, the, marxist, analysis, the, view, of, the, rebellion, as, a, traditionalist, rebellion, and, intensive, studies, of, local, uprisings, many, of, the, key, primary, and, secondary, sources, appear, in, biswamoy, pati, ed, 1857, rebellion, thomas, r, metcalf, has, stressed, the, importance, of, the, work, by, cambridge, professor, eric, stokes, 1924, 1981, especially, stokes, the, peasant, and, the, raj, studies, in, agrarian, society, and, peasant, rebellion, in, colonial, india, 1978, metcalf, says, stokes, undermines, the, assumption, that, 1857, was, a, response, to, general, causes, emanating, from, entire, classes, of, people, instead, stokes, argues, that, 1, those, indians, who, suffered, the, greatest, relative, deprivation, rebelled, and, that, 2, the, decisive, factor, in, precipitating, a, revolt, was, the, presence, of, prosperous, magnates, who, supported, british, rule, stokes, also, explores, issues, of, economic, development, the, nature, of, privileged, landholding, the, role, of, moneylenders, the, usefulness, of, classical, rent, theory, and, especially, the, notion, of, the, rich, peasant, to, kim, a, wagner, who, has, conducted, the, most, recent, survey, of, the, literature, modern, indian, historiography, is, yet, to, move, beyond, responding, to, the, prejudice, of, colonial, accounts, wagner, sees, no, reason, why, atrocities, committed, by, indians, should, be, understated, or, inflated, merely, because, these, things, offend, our, post, colonial, sensibilities, wagner, also, stresses, the, importance, of, william, dalrymple, s, the, last, mughal, the, fall, of, a, dynasty, delhi, 1857, dalrymple, was, assisted, by, mahmood, farooqui, who, translated, key, urdu, and, shikastah, sources, and, published, a, selection, in, besieged, voices, from, delhi, 1857, dalrymple, emphasized, the, role, of, religion, and, explored, in, detail, the, internal, divisions, and, politico, religious, discord, amongst, the, rebels, he, did, not, discover, much, in, the, way, of, proto, nationalism, or, any, of, the, roots, of, modern, india, in, the, rebellion, sabbaq, ahmed, has, looked, at, the, ways, in, which, ideologies, of, royalism, militarism, and, jihad, influenced, the, behaviour, of, contending, muslim, factions, almost, from, the, moment, the, first, sepoys, mutinied, in, meerut, the, nature, and, the, scope, of, the, indian, rebellion, of, 1857, has, been, contested, and, argued, over, speaking, in, the, house, of, commons, in, july, 1857, benjamin, disraeli, labelled, it, a, national, revolt, while, lord, palmerston, the, prime, minister, tried, to, downplay, the, scope, and, the, significance, of, the, event, as, a, mere, military, mutiny, reflecting, this, debate, an, early, historian, of, the, rebellion, charles, ball, used, the, word, mutiny, in, his, title, but, labelled, it, a, struggle, for, liberty, and, independence, as, a, people, in, the, text, historians, remain, divided, on, whether, the, rebellion, can, properly, be, considered, a, war, of, indian, independence, or, not, although, it, is, popularly, considered, to, be, one, in, india, arguments, against, include, a, second, school, of, thought, while, acknowledging, the, validity, of, the, above, mentioned, arguments, opines, that, this, rebellion, may, indeed, be, called, a, war, of, india, s, independence, the, reasons, advanced, are, the, government, of, india, celebrated, the, year, 2007, as, the, 150th, anniversary, of, india, s, first, war, of, independence, several, books, written, by, indian, authors, were, released, in, the, anniversary, year,

attempted, to, visit, the, site, of, the, siege, of, lucknow, however, fears, of, violence, by, indian, demonstrators, supported, by, the, hindu, nationalist, bharatiya, janata, party, prevented, the,
