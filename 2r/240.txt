originating, as, the, northwestern, sector, of, the, mongol, empire, with, the, division, of, the, mongol, empire, after, 1259, it, became, a, functionally, separate, khanate, it, is, also, known, as, the, kipchak, khanate, or, as, the, ulus, of, jochi, and, it, replaced, the, earlier, less, organized, cuman, kipchak, confederation, after, the, death, of, batu, khan, the, founder, of, the, golden, horde, in, 1255, his, dynasty, flourished, for, a, full, century, until, 1359, though, the, intrigues, of, nogai, instigated, a, partial, civil, war, in, the, late, 1290s, the, horde, s, military, power, peaked, during, the, reign, of, uzbeg, khan, 1312, 1341, who, adopted, islam, the, territory, of, the, golden, horde, at, its, peak, extended, from, siberia, and, central, asia, to, parts, of, eastern, europe, from, the, urals, to, the, danube, in, the, west, and, from, the, black, sea, to, the, caspian, sea, in, the, south, while, bordering, the, caucasus, mountains, and, the, territories, of, the, mongol, dynasty, known, as, the, ilkhanate, the, khanate, experienced, violent, internal, political, disorder, known, as, the, great, troubles, 1359, 1381, before, it, briefly, reunited, under, tokhtamysh, 1381, 1395, however, soon, after, the, 1396, invasion, of, timur, the, founder, of, the, timurid, empire, the, golden, horde, broke, into, smaller, tatar, khanates, which, declined, steadily, in, power, at, the, start, of, the, 15th, century, the, horde, began, to, fall, apart, by, 1466, it, was, being, referred, to, simply, as, the, great, horde, within, its, territories, there, emerged, numerous, predominantly, turkic, khanates, these, internal, struggles, allowed, moscow, to, formally, rid, itself, of, the, tatar, yoke, at, the, great, stand, on, the, ugra, river, in, 1480, which, traditionally, marks, the, end, of, mongol, rule, over, russia, the, crimean, khanate, and, the, kazakh, khanate, the, last, remnants, of, the, golden, horde, survived, until, 1783, and, 1847, respectively, when, they, were, conquered, by, the, expanding, russian, state, the, name, golden, horde, is, a, partial, calque, of, russian, zolot, ya, ord, itself, supposedly, a, partial, calque, of, turkic, altan, orda, zolot, ya, was, translated, to, golden, while, ord, was, transliterated, to, horde, the, turkic, word, orda, means, palace, camp, or, headquarters, in, this, case, the, headquarters, of, the, khan, being, the, capital, of, the, khanate, metonymically, extended, to, the, khanate, itself, the, english, word, horde, in, the, sense, of, a, large, and, often, threatening, group, emerged, later, metaphorically, extended, from, the, reputation, of, the, mongol, hordes, the, appellation, golden, is, said, to, have, been, inspired, by, the, golden, color, of, the, tents, the, mongols, lived, in, during, wartime, or, an, actual, golden, tent, used, by, batu, khan, or, by, zbeg, khan, or, to, have, been, bestowed, by, the, slavic, tributaries, to, describe, the, great, wealth, of, the, khan, it, was, not, until, the, 16th, century, that, russian, chroniclers, begin, explicitly, using, the, term, to, refer, to, this, particular, successor, khanate, of, the, mongol, empire, the, first, known, use, of, the, term, in, 1565, in, a, russian, chronicle, called, history, of, kazan, applied, it, to, the, ulus, of, batu, centered, on, sarai, in, contemporary, persian, armenian, and, muslim, writings, and, in, the, records, of, the, 13th, and, early, 14th, centuries, such, as, the, yuanshi, and, the, jami, al, tawarikh, the, khanate, was, called, the, ulus, of, jochi, realm, of, jochi, in, mongolian, dasht, i, qipchaq, persian, qipchaq, steppe, or, khanate, of, the, qipchaq, and, comania, or, cumania, the, eastern, or, left, wing, or, left, hand, in, official, mongolian, sponsored, persian, sources, was, referred, to, as, the, blue, horde, in, russian, chronicles, and, as, the, white, horde, in, timurid, sources, e, g, zafar, nameh, western, scholars, have, tended, to, follow, the, timurid, sources, nomenclature, and, call, the, left, wing, the, white, horde, but, temish, hajji, fl, 1550, a, historian, of, khwarazm, called, the, left, wing, the, blue, horde, and, since, he, was, familiar, with, the, oral, traditions, of, the, khanate, empire, it, seems, likely, that, the, russian, chroniclers, were, correct, and, that, the, khanate, itself, called, its, left, wing, the, blue, horde, the, khanate, apparently, used, the, term, white, horde, to, refer, to, its, right, wing, which, was, situated, in, batu, s, home, base, in, sarai, and, controlled, the, ulus, the, designations, golden, horde, blue, horde, and, white, horde, have, not, been, encountered, in, the, sources, of, the, mongol, period, 2nd, invasion, 1259, 60, 3rd, invasion, 1287, 88, at, his, death, in, 1227, genghis, khan, divided, the, mongol, empire, amongst, his, four, sons, as, appanages, but, the, empire, remained, united, under, the, supreme, khan, jochi, was, the, eldest, but, he, died, six, months, before, genghis, the, westernmost, lands, occupied, by, the, mongols, which, included, what, is, today, southern, russia, and, kazakhstan, were, given, to, jochi, s, eldest, sons, batu, khan, who, eventually, became, ruler, of, the, blue, horde, and, orda, khan, who, became, the, leader, of, the, white, horde, in, 1235, batu, with, the, great, general, subutai, began, an, invasion, westwards, first, conquering, the, bashkirs, and, then, moving, on, to, volga, bulgaria, in, 1236, from, there, he, conquered, some, of, the, southern, steppes, of, present, day, ukraine, in, 1237, forcing, many, of, the, local, cumans, to, retreat, westward, the, mongol, campaign, against, the, kypchaks, and, cumans, had, already, started, under, jochi, and, subutai, in, 1216, 1218, when, the, merkits, took, shelter, among, them, by, 1239, a, large, portion, of, cumans, were, driven, out, of, the, crimean, peninsula, and, it, became, one, of, the, appanages, of, the, mongol, empire, the, remnants, of, the, crimean, cumans, survived, in, the, crimean, mountains, and, they, would, in, time, mix, with, other, groups, in, the, crimea, including, greeks, goths, and, mongols, to, form, the, crimean, tatar, population, moving, north, batu, began, the, mongol, invasion, of, rus, and, spent, three, years, subjugating, the, principalities, whilst, his, cousins, m, ngke, kadan, and, g, y, k, moved, southwards, into, alania, using, the, migration, of, the, cumans, as, their, casus, belli, the, mongols, continued, west, raiding, poland, and, hungary, which, culminated, in, mongol, victories, at, the, battles, of, legnica, and, mohi, in, 1241, however, gedei, khan, died, in, the, mongolian, homeland, batu, turned, back, from, his, siege, of, vienna, but, did, not, return, to, mongolia, rather, opting, to, stay, at, the, volga, river, his, brother, orda, returned, to, take, part, in, the, succession, the, mongol, armies, would, never, again, travel, so, far, west, in, 1242, after, retreating, through, hungary, destroying, pest, in, the, process, and, subjugating, bulgaria, batu, established, his, capital, at, sarai, commanding, the, lower, stretch, of, the, volga, river, on, the, site, of, the, khazar, capital, of, atil, shortly, before, that, the, younger, brother, of, batu, and, orda, shiban, was, given, his, own, enormous, ulus, east, of, the, ural, mountains, along, the, ob, and, irtysh, rivers, while, the, mongolian, language, was, undoubtedly, in, general, use, at, the, court, of, batu, few, mongol, texts, written, in, the, territory, of, the, golden, horde, have, survived, perhaps, because, of, the, prevalent, general, illiteracy, according, to, grigor, ev, yarliq, or, decrees, of, the, khans, were, written, in, mongol, then, translated, into, the, cuman, language, the, existence, of, arabic, mongol, and, persian, mongol, dictionaries, dating, from, the, middle, of, the, 14th, century, and, prepared, for, the, use, of, the, egyptian, mamluk, sultanate, suggests, that, there, was, a, practical, need, for, such, works, in, the, chancelleries, handling, correspondence, with, the, golden, horde, it, is, thus, reasonable, to, conclude, that, letters, received, by, the, mamluks, if, not, also, written, by, them, must, have, been, in, mongol, when, the, great, khatun, t, regene, invited, batu, to, elect, the, next, emperor, of, the, mongol, empire, in, 1242, he, declined, to, attend, the, kurultai, and, instead, stayed, at, the, volga, river, although, batu, excused, himself, by, saying, he, was, suffering, from, old, age, and, illness, it, seems, that, he, did, not, support, the, election, of, g, y, k, khan, g, y, k, and, b, ri, a, grandson, of, chagatai, khan, had, quarreled, violently, with, batu, at, a, victory, banquet, during, the, mongol, occupation, of, eastern, europe, he, sent, his, brothers, to, the, kurultai, and, the, new, khagan, of, the, mongols, was, elected, in, 1246, all, the, senior, princes, of, rus, including, yaroslav, ii, of, vladimir, daniel, of, galicia, and, sviatoslav, iii, of, vladimir, acknowledged, batu, s, supremacy, originally, batu, ordered, daniel, to, turn, the, administration, of, galicia, over, to, the, mongols, but, daniel, personally, visited, batu, in, 1245, and, pledged, allegiance, to, him, after, returning, from, his, trip, daniel, was, visibly, influenced, by, the, mongols, and, equipped, his, army, in, the, mongol, fashion, his, horsemen, with, mongol, style, cuirasses, and, their, mounts, armoured, with, shoulder, chest, and, head, pieces, michael, of, chernigov, who, had, killed, a, mongol, envoy, in, 1240, refused, to, show, obeisance, and, was, executed, in, 1246, when, g, y, k, called, batu, to, pay, him, homage, several, times, batu, sent, yaroslav, ii, andrey, ii, of, vladimir, and, alexander, nevsky, to, karakorum, in, mongolia, in, 1247, yaroslav, ii, never, returned, and, died, in, mongolia, he, was, probably, poisoned, by, t, regene, khatun, who, probably, did, it, to, spite, batu, and, even, her, own, son, g, y, k, because, he, did, not, approve, of, her, regency, g, y, k, appointed, andrey, as, the, grand, prince, of, vladimir, and, alexander, was, given, the, princely, title, of, kiev, however, when, they, returned, andrey, went, to, vladimir, while, alexander, went, to, novgorod, instead, a, bishop, by, the, name, of, cyril, went, to, kiev, and, found, it, so, devastated, that, he, abandoned, the, place, and, went, further, east, instead, in, 1248, g, y, k, demanded, batu, come, east, to, meet, him, a, move, that, some, contemporaries, regarded, as, a, pretext, for, batu, s, arrest, in, compliance, with, the, order, batu, approached, bringing, a, large, army, when, g, y, k, moved, westwards, tolui, s, widow, and, a, sister, of, batu, s, stepmother, sorghaghtani, warned, batu, that, the, jochids, might, be, his, target, g, y, k, died, on, the, way, in, what, is, now, xinjiang, at, about, the, age, of, 42, although, some, modern, historians, believe, that, he, died, of, natural, causes, because, of, deteriorating, health, he, may, have, succumbed, to, the, combined, effects, of, alcoholism, and, gout, or, he, may, have, been, poisoned, william, of, rubruck, and, a, muslim, chronicler, state, that, batu, killed, the, imperial, envoy, and, one, of, his, brothers, murdered, the, great, khan, g, y, k, but, these, claims, are, not, completely, corroborated, by, other, major, sources, g, y, k, s, widow, oghul, qaimish, took, over, as, regent, but, she, was, unable, to, keep, the, succession, within, her, branch, of, the, family, with, the, assistance, of, batu, m, ngke, succeeded, as, great, khan, in, 1251,

russians, armenians, georgians, circassians, alans, crimean, greeks, crimean, goths, bulgarians, and, vlachs, the, objective, of, the, golden, horde, in, conquered, lands, revolved, around, obtaining, recruits, for, the, army, and, exacting, tax, payments, from, its, subjects, in, most, cases, the, golden, horde, did, not, implement, direct, control, over, the, people, they, conquered, for, three, centuries, mongol, or, tatar, presence, was, an, undeniable, fact, for, russians, although, defined, as, russians, here, there, was, no, russian, people, or, russian, nation, during, the, period, of, mongol, rule, and, therefore, no, cohesive, national, response, aristocratic, russians, responded, more, uniformly, to, mongol, rule, but, the, same, cannot, be, said, with, certainty, for, the, peasantry, there, is, not, much, evidence, for, mongol, influence, on, the, russian, peasantry, whose, direct, contact, with, the, mongols, was, mainly, through, slavery, or, forced, labor, russian, sources, generally, tend, to, focus, on, military, encounters, with, the, mongols, but, the, literary, prose, betrays, a, greater, mongol, impact, on, russian, society, than, accepted, at, face, value, there, was, a, great, deal, of, familiarity, with, the, mongols, among, writers, who, recorded, the, name, of, virtually, every, mongol, prince, grandee, and, official, they, came, into, contact, with, the, galician, volhynian, chronicle, recounts, the, words, of, tovrul, a, captured, informant, at, the, siege, of, kiev, 1240, who, identifies, the, mongol, captains, by, name, russian, sources, contain, a, list, of, the, khans, of, the, golden, horde, as, well, as, more, detail, on, their, careers, during, the, time, of, great, troubles, than, arab, persian, sources, even, the, names, of, numerous, lesser, ranked, mongols, are, mentioned, the, mongol, khan, was, called, tsar, a, title, also, used, for, the, basileus, it, is, evident, that, the, writers, expected, their, audience, to, be, familiar, with, the, names, of, individual, mongols, and, their, attributes, despite, their, pervasive, hostility, while, the, mongols, generally, did, not, directly, administer, the, eastern, european, lands, they, conquered, in, the, cases, of, the, principality, of, pereyaslavl, principality, of, kiev, and, podolia, they, removed, the, native, administration, altogether, and, replaced, it, with, their, own, direct, control, the, kingdom, of, galicia, volhynia, principality, of, smolensk, principality, of, chernigov, and, principality, of, novgorod, seversk, retained, their, princes, but, also, had, to, contend, with, mongol, agents, who, enforced, recruitment, and, tax, collection, the, novgorod, republic, was, exempt, from, the, presence, of, mongol, agents, after, 1260, but, still, had, to, pay, taxes, the, mongols, took, censuses, in, 1245, 1258, 1259, 1260, 1274, and, 1275, no, further, censuses, were, taken, after, that, some, places, such, as, the, town, of, tula, became, the, personal, property, of, individual, mongols, such, as, the, khatun, taidula, the, mother, of, jani, beg, the, russian, aristocracy, had, to, familiarize, themselves, with, the, workings, of, mongol, high, society, the, prince, had, to, receive, a, patent, for, his, throne, from, the, khan, who, then, sent, an, envoy, to, install, the, prince, on, his, throne, from, the, time, of, z, beg, khan, on, a, commissioner, was, appointed, by, the, khan, to, reside, at, each, of, the, principalities, capitals, mongol, rule, loosened, in, the, late, 13th, century, so, that, some, princes, were, able, to, collect, taxes, as, the, khan, s, agents, by, the, early, 14th, century, all, the, grand, dukes, were, collecting, taxes, by, themselves, so, that, the, average, people, no, longer, dealt, with, mongol, overlords, while, their, rulers, answered, to, sarai, aristocratic, familiarity, with, mongol, customs, did, not, result, in, adopting, mongol, culture, any, partiality, shown, towards, mongol, customs, could, be, dangerous, although, in, one, instance, they, did, adopt, mongol, military, attire, after, visiting, batu, s, camp, in, 1245, daniel, of, galicia, was, visibly, influenced, by, the, mongols, and, equipped, his, army, in, the, mongol, fashion, austrian, visitors, to, his, camp, remarked, that, only, daniel, himself, dressed, according, to, the, custom, in, rus, with, a, coat, of, greek, brocade, with, gold, lace, green, leather, boots, a, gilded, saddle, and, gold, encrusted, sword, mongols, that, moved, into, russian, society, shed, their, former, customs, as, they, adopted, orthodox, christianity, and, despite, the, numerous, mentions, of, mongol, atrocities, some, more, honorable, portrayals, do, exist, in, the, tale, of, the, destruction, of, ryazan, the, mongol, batu, exhibited, chivalric, courtesy, to, the, russian, noble, evpaty, by, allowing, his, men, to, carry, him, off, the, field, in, honor, of, his, bravery,

after, the, golden, horde, mongols, converted, to, islam, until, the, 15th, century, when, the, weakened, horde, s, mongol, grandees, moved, into, muscovite, territory, most, of, them, entered, into, the, service, of, grand, princes, married, aristocracy, converted, to, christianity, and, became, assimilated, it, is, uncertain, how, much, mongol, tatar, blood, entered, the, russian, aristocracy, some, mongols, might, have, changed, their, names, after, converting, while, russians, took, on, mongol, nicknames, as, patronyms, the, nobles, of, ryazan, and, the, godunov, clan, of, prince, chet, claimed, tatar, descent, mongol, ancestry, was, considered, as, prestigious, as, german, latin, and, greek, ancestry, in, the, 16th, century, although, such, views, declined, dramatically, after, the, time, of, troubles, there, was, also, intermarriage, with, their, other, subjects, such, as, between, berke, and, a, seljuk, princess, and, j, ge, eldest, son, of, nogai, and, a, bulgarian, princess, during, early, mongol, rule, the, basqaqs, collected, taxes, imposed, by, the, mongols, with, only, russian, clergy, being, exempt, from, the, taxes, in, a, system, known, in, russian, as, baskachestvo, russian, in, the, privilege, charters, given, to, russian, clergy, the, terms, dan, and, poshlina, are, given, which, by, the, second, half, of, the, 13th, century, primarily, came, to, refer, to, the, tatar, tribute, the, mongols, required, the, russian, orthodox, church, to, pray, for, the, health, of, the, khan, and, in, return, they, looked, after, the, church, s, health, and, fostered, its, growth, a, bishopric, was, established, in, sarai, for, russians, and, to, act, as, an, intermediary, between, the, golden, horde, and, both, the, russian, church, and, byzantium, the, khans, granted, the, church, significant, tax, privileges, which, enabled, it, to, recover, from, the, invasion, and, prosper, even, more, than, before, it, was, during, the, 14th, century, that, the, church, made, decisive, inroads, into, the, pagan, countryside, possibly, due, to, the, attraction, of, economic, benefits, bestowed, upon, church, lands, that, incentivized, peasants, to, settle, the, tale, of, peters, tsarevich, of, the, horde, was, written, in, the, 14th, century, it, tells, of, how, the, mongol, peter, a, descendant, of, genghis, khan, converted, and, founded, the, petrov, monastery, peter, s, descendants, used, their, ties, to, the, khans, to, protect, the, monastery, from, the, rostov, princes, and, the, neighboring, russians, who, desired, the, fishing, rights, to, that, land, the, depiction, of, mongols, by, church, was, mixed, and, awkward, it, portrayed, them, as, a, disaster, and, their, caretaker, this, contradiction, can, be, seen, in, the, khans, portrayals, in, church, texts, where, the, khans, names, would, have, been, in, the, missals, there, was, a, blank, space, for, the, name, to, be, read, aloud, orally, there, was, also, a, careful, delineation, between, khan, and, tatars, hagiographers, sometimes, absolved, the, khans, from, their, role, in, killing, russian, princes, after, the, khans, power, began, to, wane, in, the, 14th, century, the, church, gave, its, full, backing, to, the, russian, princes, however, even, after, mongol, rule, ended, the, church, still, invoked, the, mongol, model, as, an, example, of, how, they, should, be, treated, in, the, 16th, century, churchmen, circulated, a, translated, mongol, yarlyk, that, granted, tax, immunity, to, the, church, the, historian, charles, halperin, cautioned, to, analyze, the, mongols, administration, of, russia, requires, meticulous, examination, both, of, the, extant, sources, individually, and, of, the, larger, picture, they, present, many, of, the, references, to, mongol, officials, occur, in, unreliable, texts, from, later, periods, showing, obvious, signs, of, interpolation, although, it, is, evident, that, the, mongols, started, collecting, taxes, in, the, principalities, as, early, as, 1245, shortly, after, they, subdued, them, during, or, after, the, invasion, of, 1237, this, appears, to, have, been, a, localised, affair, with, baskaki, singular, baskak, or, basqaq, a, turkic, word, used, in, early, sources, meaning, a, local, mongol, official, who, was, primarily, responsible, for, collecting, tribute, and, conscripting, troops, appointed, per, village, town, or, city, rather, than, a, simultaneous, imposition, of, a, uniform, taxation, system, during, the, first, half, of, the, 14th, century, the, basqaqs, disappeared, and, the, russian, princes, themselves, began, to, gather, the, total, sum, of, taxes, following, a, number, of, revolts, at, the, end, of, the, 13th, century, leading, to, the, princes, to, act, as, governors, on, behalf, of, the, khan, the, handling, of, russian, affairs, was, moved, to, sarai, where, various, darughas, supervised, the, russian, principalities, along, with, the, darugha, of, moscow, other, darughas, may, have, existed, with, the, same, level, of, authority, over, other, russian, territories, such, ryazan, and, tver, by, the, 14th, century, the, other, drughas, likely, disappeared, as, the, grand, prince, of, moscow, assumed, the, role, of, collecting, and, presenting, the, taxes, from, all, the, russian, principalities, as, the, horde, became, politically, weakened, and, the, grand, princes, of, moscow, grew, in, power, it, was, possible, for, the, tribute, to, be, withheld, such, as, in, 1372, 1382, and, 1396, 1408, ultimately, ivan, iii, stopped, paying, tribute, in, 1472, 1476, leading, to, a, standoff, in, 1480, which, ended, without, military, confrontation, moscow, adopted, the, mongol, tax, system, and, continued, to, collect, tribute, after, they, stopped, passing, it, onto, the, golden, horde, the, muscovite, grand, princes, replaced, the, mongol, basqaq, with, officials, called, danshchiki, who, collected, tribute, known, as, dan, which, was, probably, modeled, after, the, mongol, tribute, system, the, russians, adopted, the, mongol, word, for, treasury, kazna, treasurer, kaznachey, and, money, den, ga, the, muscovites, used, the, mongol, customs, tax, system, called, tamga, from, which, the, russian, word, tamozhnya, customs, house, is, derived, from, the, yam, postal, system, was, adopted, by, russia, in, the, late, 15th, century, as, the, peasants, had, already, been, paying, a, yam, tax, for, centuries, the, practice, of, poruka, collective, responsibility, of, a, sworn, group, became, more, common, in, russia, during, the, mongol, period, and, may, have, been, influenced, by, the, mongols, the, mongols, may, have, spread, the, practice, of, beating, the, shins, as, a, punishment, from, china, to, russia, where, this, punishment, for, non, payment, of, debts, was, called, pravezh, when, the, grand, princes, of, moscow, collected, the, tribute, the, term, vykhod, became, more, common, instead, of, dan, the, existence, of, a, double, taxation, system, led, to, the, increased, exploitation, of, the, russian, peasants, and, the, gradual, enrichment, of, the, treasuries, of, the, russian, princes, in, addition, the, tax, obligations, were, greater, for, those, who, were, poorer, the, russians, also, attempted, to, evade, the, yearly, tribute, taking, advantage, of, tatar, infighting, while, at, the, same, time, also, continuing, the, collection, of, tribute, the, tatar, taxation, system, was, exploitative, for, the, russian, principalities, during, the, 13th, century, but, by, the, 14th, century, the, grand, principality, of, moscow, experienced, uninterrupted, economic, growth, starting, from, the, reign, of, ivan, i, the, grand, princes, of, moscow, also, manipulated, the, vykhod, which, was, made, up, of, various, taxes, and, tolls, allowing, them, to, increase, their, revenue, by, imposing, larger, sums, than, was, necessary, while, the, tatar, tribute, was, typically, a, negotiated, sum, the, most, credible, estimates, put, the, amount, of, tribute, between, 5, 000, and, 7, 000, rubles, per, year, between, 1380, and, 1472, falling, to, 1, 000, rubles, after, 1480, the, tribute, to, the, horde, decreased, and, was, at, times, interrupted, during, the, 14th, and, 15th, centuries, as, a, result, of, its, political, decline, and, the, strengthening, of, russian, and, polish, lithuanian, authority, some, of, the, mongols, subjects, adopted, mongol, military, accoutrements, in, 1245, daniel, of, galicia, s, army, was, dressed, in, the, mongol, fashion, after, a, visit, to, batu, khan, s, camp, austrian, visitors, to, daniel, s, camp, remarked, that, with, the, exception, of, daniel, himself, all, the, horsemen, dressed, like, mongols, muscovite, cavalrymen, were, equipped, in, a, similar, fashion, to, the, mongols, as, late, as, the, 16th, century, when, they, were, depicted, using, a, mongol, style, saddle, with, mongol, stirrups, wearing, a, mongol, helmet, and, armed, with, a, mongol, bow, and, quiver, european, observers, mistook, them, for, ottoman, dress, muscovite, armies, also, deployed, in, a, similar, fashion, to, the, mongols, with, the, right, guard, ranked, above, the, left, due, to, a, shamanist, belief, the, emphasis, on, cavalry, declined, in, the, 16th, century, as, warfare, increasingly,

one, male, of, commoner, status, belonged, to, r1a, four, of, the, skeletons, belonged, to, the, east, eurasian, mtdna, haplogroups, d4, and, cz, all, the, skulls, dated, from, tavan, tolgoi, graves, were, anthropologically, mongoloid, despite, their, east, asian, physical, appearance, their, genealogical, admixture, reveals, a, admixture, of, east, asian, and, caucasian, ethnic, groups, which, was, attributed, to, inter, racial, marriages, between, mongolian, plateau, females, and, male, migrants, from, europe, however, the, authors, could, not, determine, when, and, how, these, intermarriages, took, place, but, it, was, likely, to, have, existed, through, generations, of, intermixing, through, their, ancestors, before, the, existence, of, the, golden, family, the, study, proposed, multiple, theories, as, to, how, the, bodies, were, related, to, the, golden, family, the, tavan, tolgoi, bodies, could, have, been, product, of, marriages, between, the, female, lineage, of, genghis, khan, s, borjigin, clan, and, the, male, lineage, of, either, the, hongirad, clans, or, the, ongud, the, ongud, were, a, tribe, that, may, have, originated, in, west, asia, and, were, descended, from, the, shatuo, turks, suggesting, that, they, may, have, had, a, caucasoid, appearance, based, on, the, fact, they, were, carriers, of, haplogroup, r1b, contemporary, records, from, the, later, tang, 923, 937, ad, described, some, male, shatuo, turks, as, having, deep, set, eyes, with, whiskers, as, well, as, slim, bodies, with, light, complexion, many, ongud, were, resettled, in, the, golden, horde, as, administrators, authors, suggested, that, the, genghis, khan, s, male, lineage, may, have, had, some, caucasoid, specific, genetic, features, because, of, descriptions, in, rashid, al, din, hamadani, s, compendium, of, chronicles, written, in, the, 14th, century, the, bodies, could, have, been, related, to, genghis, khan, s, male, lineage, which, they, propose, had, r1b, it, is, also, possible, the, bodies, were, related, to, genghis, khan, s, relatives, or, his, generals, who, were, not, part, of, the, male, lineage, borjigin, clan, these, authors, noted, that, there, is, a, close, link, between, the, current, day, distribution, of, haplogroup, r1b, and, the, spread, of, the, mongol, empire, especially, in, the, golden, horde, and, chagatai, khanate, and, that, the, descendants, of, the, tavan, tolgoi, specimens, are, now, located, mainly, in, west, eurasia, rather, than, mongolia, a, close, association, was, observed, between, haplogroup, r1b, m343,
