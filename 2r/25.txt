this, time, the, awraba, were, already, muslim, but, lived, in, an, area, where, most, tribes, were, either, christian, jewish, khariji, or, pagan, the, awraba, seem, to, have, welcomed, a, sharifi, imam, as, a, way, to, strengthen, their, political, position, idris, i, who, was, very, active, in, the, political, organization, of, the, awraba, began, by, asserting, his, authority, and, working, toward, the, subjugation, of, the, christian, and, jewish, tribes, in, 789, he, founded, a, settlement, south, east, of, volubilis, called, medinat, fas, in, 791, idris, i, was, poisoned, and, killed,

morocco, as, far, west, as, tlemcen, idris, i, had, been, completely, dependent, on, the, awraba, leadership, idris, ii, began, his, rule, with, the, weakening, of, awraba, power, by, welcoming, arab, settlers, in, walili, and, by, appointing, two, arabs, as, his, vizier, and, qadi, thus, he, transformed, himself, from, a, prot, g, of, the, awraba, into, their, sovereign, the, awraba, leader, ishak, responded, by, plotting, against, his, life, with, the, aghlabids, of, tunisia, idris, reacted, by, having, his, former, protector, ishak, killed, and, in, 809, moved, his, seat, of,

father, as, a, berber, market, town, here, he, welcomed, two, waves, of, arab, immigration, one, in, 818, from, cordoba, and, another, in, 824, from, aghlabid, tunisia, giving, fes, a, more, arab, character, than, other, maghrebi, cities, when, idris, ii, died, in, 828, the, idrisid, state, spanned, from, western, algeria, to, the, sous, in, southern, morocco, and, had, become, the, leading, state, of, morocco, ahead, of, the, principalities, of, sijilmasa, barghawata, and, nekor, which, remained, outside, their, control, 51, 52, 86, the, dynasty, s, power, would, slowly, decline, following, idris, ii, s, death, under, his, son, and, successor, muhammad, 828, 836, the, kingdom, was, divided, amongst, seven, of, his, brothers, whereby, eight, idrisid, statelets, formed, in, morocco, and, western, algeria, muhammad, himself, came, to, rule, fes, with, only, nominal, power, over, his, brothers, his, brother, isa, who, was, given, control, of, the, coastal, tamesna, regions, near, the, bou, regreg, from, his, base, at, chellah, quickly, revolted, against, him, muhammad, entrusted, his, brother, umar, who, had, received, the, territories, around, the, rif, to, punish, isa, umar, successfully, drove, isa, from, power, who, was, forced, to, take, refuge, in, chellah, and, then, turned, north, to, punish, his, other, brother, al, qasim, at, tangier, because, he, had, earlier, refused, to, join, him, and, muhammad, against, isa, al, qasim, fled, to, asilah, and, settled, nearby, while, muhammad, gave, umar, governorship, of, tangier, as, a, reward, upon, umar, s, death, in, september, or, october, 835, his, son, ali, ibn, umar, was, granted, all, of, his, father, s, domains, in, turn, muhammad, himself, died, seven, months, later, in, the, march, or, april, 836, his, son, ali, ibn, muhammad, inherited, his, position, and, ruled, for, 13, years, 836, 849, in, a, competent, manner, ensuring, the, stability, of, the, state, after, his, death, in, 849, he, was, succeeded, by, his, brother, yahya, ibn, muhammad, or, yahya, i, who, also, enjoyed, a, peaceful, reign, during, this, time, islamic, and, arabic, culture, gained, a, stronghold, in, the, towns, and, morocco, profited, from, the, trans, saharan, trade, which, came, to, be, dominated, by, muslim, mostly, berber, traders, the, city, of, fes, also, flourished, and, became, an, important, religious, center, 52, during, yahya, s, reign, more, arab, immigrants, arrived, and, the, famous, mosques, of, al, qarawiyyin, and, al, andalusiyyin, were, founded, even, so, the, islamic, and, arabic, culture, only, made, its, influence, felt, in, the, towns, with, the, vast, majority, of, morocco, s, population, still, using, the, berber, languages, and, often, adhering, to, islamic, heterodox, and, heretical, doctrines, the, idrisids, were, principally, rulers, of, the, towns, and, had, little, power, over, the, majority, of, the, country, s, population, 52, after, the, death, of, yahya, i, in, 863, he, was, succeeded, by, his, less, competent, son, yahya, ii, who, divided, up, the, idrisid, realm, yet, again, among, the, extended, families, yahya, ii, died, in, uncertain, circumstances, in, 866, after, fleeing, his, palace, after, an, episode, of, disorder, in, fes, his, cousin, ali, ibn, umar, took, over, power, in, 868, under, the, leadership, of, the, abd, al, razzaq, the, berber, khariji, sufri, tribes, of, madyuna, ghayata, and, miknasa, of, the, fes, region, formed, a, common, front, against, the, idrisids, from, their, base, in, sefrou, they, were, able, to, defeat, ali, ibn, umar, and, occupy, fes, fes, refused, to, submit, however, and, another, yahya, the, son, of, al, qasim, was, able, to, retake, the, city, and, establish, himself, as, the, new, ruler, yahya, iii, thus, the, ruling, line, had, passed, from, the, sons, of, muhammad, to, the, son, of, umar, and, now, the, sons, of, al, qasim, 52, yahya, iii, ruled, over, the, entire, idrisid, realm, and, continued, to, attack, the, sufris, in, 905, however, he, died, in, battle, against, another, family, member, yahya, ibn, idris, ibn, umar, a, grandson, of, umar, who, then, took, power, as, yahya, iv, at, this, point, however, the, fatimids, in, the, east, began, to, intervene, in, morocco, hoping, to, expand, their, influence, in, 917, the, miknasa, and, its, leader, masala, ibn, habus, acting, on, behalf, of, their, fatimid, allies, attacked, fes, and, forced, yahya, iv, to, recognize, fatimid, suzerainty, before, deposing, him, in, 919, or, 921, 63, he, was, succeeded, by, his, cousin, musa, ibn, abul, afiya, who, had, already, been, given, charge, over, the, rest, of, the, country, the, idrisid, hassan, i, al, hajam, a, grandson, of, al, qasim, managed, to, wrest, control, of, fez, from, 925, but, in, 927, musa, returned, captured, hassan, and, killed, him, marking, the, last, time, the, idrisids, held, power, in, fes, from, fes, the, miknasa, began, pursuing, the, idrisid, family, across, morocco, the, family, took, refuge, at, the, fortress, of, hajar, an, nasr, in, northern, morocco, where, the, miknasa, besieged, them, soon, after, however, civil, war, broke, out, among, the, miknasa, when, musa, switched, allegiance, to, the, umayyads, of, cordoba, in, 931, in, an, attempt, to, gain, more, independence, the, fatimids, sent, humayd, ibn, yasal, or, hamid, the, nephew, of, masala, ibn, habus, to, confront, musa, defeating, him, in, 933, and, forcing, him, to, fall, back, into, line, 63, the, idrisids, took, advantage, of, the, situation, to, break, the, siege, of, their, fortress, and, defeat, the, mikanasa, zenata, troops, once, the, fatimids, were, gone, however, musa, once, again, threw, off, their, authority, and, recognized, the, umayyad, caliph, the, fatimids, sent, their, general, maysur, to, confront, him, again, and, this, time, he, fled, he, was, pursued, and, killed, by, the, idrisids, after, this, idrisids, settled, among, the, jbala, tribes, in, the, rif, region, of, north, west, morocco, where, they, partially, rebuilt, their, power, base, from, hajar, an, nasr, alternately, acknowledging, either, the, umayyads, of, cordoba, under, abd, ar, rahman, iii, or, the, fatimids, as, overlords, al, qasim, al, gannoun, ibn, muhammad, ruled, here, from, 938, until, 948, in, the, name, of, the, fatimids, his, son, and, successor, ahmad, known, as, abul, aysh, recognized, the, umayyads, instead, but, ran, afoul, of, them, when, he, refused, to, let, them, occupy, tangier, he, was, besieged, there, and, forced, to, retreat, retaining, only, the, areas, around, al, basra, and, asilah, while, the, umayyads, occupied, the, rest, of, northern, morocco, he, eventually, left, for, al, andalus, leaving, his, brother, hasan, ibn, al, qasim, al, gannoun, as, the, new, leader, in, 954, in, 958, the, fatimids, sent, a, new, general, jawhar, to, invade, morocco, his, success, forced, the, idrisids, to, again, accept, fatimid, overlordship, 75, soon, afterwards, however, when, jawhar, and, the, fatimids, were, busy, taking, control, of, egypt, the, umayyads, made, a, comeback, in, 973, their, general, ghalib, invaded, morocco, the, idrisids, were, expelled, from, their, territories, and, al, hasan, along, with, many, other, idrisids, or, their, sons, were, taken, as, hostages, to, cordoba, in, 974, the, remaining, idrisids, in, morocco, acknowledged, umayyad, rule, al, hasan, was, later, expelled, from, cordoba, and, fled, to, egypt, which, was, now, under, fatimid, rule, in, 979, buluggin, ibn, ziri, the, fatimid, governor, of, ifriqiya, after, the, fatimid, caliphs, moved, their, capital, to, cairo, returned, to, defeat, the, umayyads, and, impose, fatimid, overlordship, in,

been, divided, among, several, zenata, principalities, in, the, late, 10th, century, and, annexed, the, emirate, of, sijilmasa, and, the, barghawata, tamesna, into, their, realm, under, yusuf, ibn, tashfin, the, almoravids, were, invited, by, the, muslim, taifa, princes, of, al, andalus, to, defend, their, territories, from, the, christian, kingdoms, their, involvement, was, crucial, in, preventing, the, fall, of, al, andalus, after, having, succeeded, in, repelling, christian, forces, in, 1086, yusuf, returned, to, iberia, in, 1090, and, annexed, most, of, the, major, taifas, almoravid, power, began, to, decline, in, the, first, half, of, the, 12th, century, as, the, dynasty, was, weakened, after, its, defeat, at, the, battle, of, ourique, and, because, of, the, agitation, of, the, almohads, the, conquest, of, the, city, of, marrakech, by, the, almohads, in, 1147, marked, the, fall, of, the, dynasty, however, fragments, of, the, almoravids, the, banu, ghaniya, continued, to, struggle, in, the, balearic, islands, and, in, tunisia, the, berbers, of, the, tamazgha, in, the, early, middle, ages, could, be, roughly, classified, into, three, major, groups, the, zenata, across, the, north, the, masmuda, concentrated, in, central, morocco, and, the, sanhaja, clustered, in, two, areas, the, western, part, of, the, sahara, and, the, hills, of, the, eastern, maghreb, the, eastern, sanhaja, included, the, kutama, berbers, who, had, been, the, base, of, the, fatimid, rise, in, the, early, 10th, century, and, the, zirid, dynasty, who, ruled, ifriqiya, as, vassals, of, the, fatimids, after, the, latter, moved, to, egypt, in, 972, the, western, sanhaja, were, divided, into, several, tribes, the, gazzula, and, the, lamta, in, the, draa, valley, and, the, foothills, of, the, anti, atlas, range, further, south, encamped, in, the, western, sahara, were, the, massufa, the, lamtuna, and, the, banu, warith, and, most, southerly, of, all, the, gudala, in, littoral, mauritania, down, to, the, borderlands, of, the, senegal, river, the, western, sanhaja, had, been, converted, to, islam, some, time, in, the, 9th, century, they, were, subsequently, united, in, the, 10th, century, and, with, the, zeal, of, new, converts, launched, several, campaigns, against, the, sudanese, pagan, peoples, of, sub, saharan, africa, under, their, king, tinbarutan, ibn, usfayshar, the, sanhaja, lamtuna, erected, or, captured, the, citadel, of, awdaghust, a, critical, stop, on, the, trans, saharan, trade, route, after, the, collapse, of, the, sanhaja, union, awdagust, passed, over, to, the, ghana, empire, and, the, trans, saharan, routes, were, taken, over, by, the, zenata, maghrawa, of, sijilmassa, the, maghrawa, also, exploited, this, disunion, to, dislodge, the, sanhaja, gazzula, and, lamta, out, of, their, pasturelands, in, the, sous, and, draa, valleys, around, 1035, the, lamtuna, chieftain, abu, abdallah, muhammad, ibn, tifat, alias, tarsina, tried, to, reunite, the, sanhaja, desert, tribes, but, his, reign, lasted, less, than, three, years, around, 1040, yahya, ibn, ibrahim, a, chieftain, of, the, gudala, and, brother, in, law, of, the, late, tarsina, went, on, pilgrimage, to, mecca, on, his, return, he, stopped, by, kairouan, in, ifriqiya, where, he, met, abu, imran, al, fasi, a, native, of, fes, and, a, jurist, and, scholar, of, the, sunni, maliki, school, at, this, time, ifriqiya, was, in, ferment, the, zirid, ruler, al, muizz, ibn, badis, was, openly, contemplating, breaking, with, his, shi, ite, fatimid, overlords, in, cairo, and, the, jurists, of, kairouan, were, agitating, for, him, to, do, so, within, this, heady, atmosphere, yahya, and, abu, imran, fell, into, conversation, on, the, state, of, the, faith, in, their, western, homelands, and, yahya, expressed, his, disappointment, at, the, lack, of, religious, education, and, negligence, of, islamic, law, among, his, southern, sanhaja, people, with, abu, imran, s, recommendation, yahya, ibn, ibrahim, made, his, way, to, the, ribat, of, waggag, ibn, zelu, in, the, sous, valley, of, southern, morocco, to, seek, out, a, maliki, teacher, for, his, people, waggag, assigned, him, one, of, his, residents, abdallah, ibn, yasin, abdallah, ibn, yasin, was, a, gazzula, berber, and, probably, a, convert, rather, than, a, born, muslim, his, name, can, be, read, as, son, of, ya, sin, the, title, of, the, 36th, sura, of, the, qur, an, suggesting, he, had, obliterated, his, family, past, and, was, re, born, of, the, holy, book, ibn, yasin, certainly, had, the, ardor, of, a, puritan, zealot, his, creed, was, mainly, characterized, by, a, rigid, formalism, and, a, strict, adherence, to, the, dictates, of, the, qur, an, and, the, orthodox, tradition, chroniclers, such, as, al, bakri, allege, ibn, yasin, s, learning, was, superficial, ibn, yasin, s, initial, meetings, with, the, gudala, people, went, poorly, as, he, had, more, ardor, than, depth, ibn, yasin, s, arguments, were, disputed, by, his, audience, he, responded, to, questioning, with, charges, of, apostasy, and, handed, out, harsh, punishments, for, the, slightest, deviations, the, gudala, soon, had, enough, and, expelled, him, almost, immediately, after, the, death, of, his, protector, yahya, ibn, ibrahim, sometime, in, the, 1040s, ibn, yasin, however, found, a, more, favorable, reception, among, the, neighboring, lamtuna, people, probably, sensing, the, useful, organizing, power, of, ibn, yasin, s, pious, fervor, the, lamtuna, chieftain, yahya, ibn, umar, al, lamtuni, invited, the, man, to, preach, to, his, people, the, lamtuna, leaders, however, kept, ibn, yasin, on, a, careful, leash, forging, a, more, productive, partnership, between, them, invoking, stories, of, the, early, life, of, muhammad, ibn, yasin, preached, that, conquest, was, a, necessary, addendum, to, islamicization, that, it, was, not, enough, to, merely, adhere, to, god, s, law, but, necessary, to, also, destroy, opposition, to, it, in, ibn, yasin, s, ideology, anything, and, everything, outside, of, islamic, law, could, be, characterized, as, opposition, he, identified, tribalism, in, particular, as, an, obstacle, he, believed, it, was, not, enough, to, urge, his, audiences, to, put, aside, their, blood, loyalties, and, ethnic, differences, and, embrace, the, equality, of, all, muslims, under, the, sacred, law, it, was, necessary, to, make, them, do, so, for, the, lamtuna, leadership, this, new, ideology, dovetailed, with, their, long, desire, to, refound, the, sanhaja, union, and, recover, their, lost, dominions, in, the, early, 1050s, the, lamtuna, under, the, joint, leadership, of, yahya, ibn, umar, and, abdallah, ibn, yasin, soon, calling, themselves, the, al, murabitin, almoravids, set, out, on, a, campaign, to, bring, their, neighbors, over, to, their, cause, the, almohad, caliphate, ipa, l, m, h, d, arabic, or, or, from, arabic, romanized, al, muwa, id, n, lit, those, who, profess, the, unity, of, god, 246, was, a, north, african, berber, muslim, empire, founded, in, present, day, morocco, at, the, 12th, century, at, its, height, it, controlled, much, of, the, iberian, peninsula, al, andalus, and, north, africa, the, maghreb, the, almohad, doctrine, was, founded, by, ibn, tumart, among, the, berber, masmuda, tribes, a, berber, tribal, confederation, of, the, atlas, mountains, of, southern, morocco, at, the, time, morocco, western, algeria, and, spain, al, andalus, were, under, the, rule, of, the, almoravids, a, sanhaja, berber, dynasty, around, 1120, ibn, tumart, first, established, a, berber, state, in, tinmel, in, the, atlas, mountains, early, in, his, life, ibn, tumart, went, to, spain, to, pursue, his, studies, and, thereafter, to, baghdad, to, deepen, them, in, baghdad, ibn, tumart, attached, himself, to, the, theological, school, of, al, ash, ari, and, came, under, the, influence, of, the, teacher, al, ghazali, he, soon, developed, his, own, system, combining, the, doctrines, of, various, masters, ibn, tumart, s, main, principle, was, a, strict, unitarianism, tawhid, which, denied, the, independent, existence, of, the, attributes, of, god, as, being, incompatible, with, his, unity, and, therefore, a, polytheistic, idea, ibn, tumart, represented, a, revolt, against, what, he, perceived, as, anthropomorphism, in, muslim, orthodoxy, his, followers, would, become, known, as, the, al, muwa, id, n, almohads, meaning, those, who, affirm, the, unity, of, god, around, 1124, ibn, tumart, erected, the, ribat, of, tinmel, in, the, valley, of, the, nfis, in, the, high, atlas, an, impregnable, fortified, complex, which, would, serve, both, as, the, spiritual, center, and, military, headquarters, of, the, almohad, movement, for, the, first, eight, years, the, almohad, rebellion, was, limited, to, a, guerilla, war, along, the, peaks, and, ravines, of, the, high, atlas, in, early, 1130, the, almohads, finally, descended, from, the, mountains, for, their, first, sizeable, attack, in, the, lowlands, it, was, a, disaster, the, almohads, swept, aside, an, almoravid, column, that, had, come, out, to, meet, them, before, aghmat, and, then, chased, their, remnant, all, the, way, to, marrakesh, they, laid, siege, to, marrakesh, for, forty, days, until, in, april, or, may, 1130, the, almoravids, sallied, from, the, city, and, crushed, the, almohads, in, the, bloody, battle, of, al, buhayra, named, after, a, large, garden, east, of, the, city, the, almohads, were, thoroughly, routed, with, huge, losses, half, their, leadership, was, killed, in, action, and, the, survivors, only, just, managed, to, scramble, back, to, the, mountains, ibn, tumart, died, shortly, after, in, august, 1130, that, the, almohad, movement, did, not, immediately, collapse, after, such, a, devastating, defeat, and, the, death, of, their, charismatic, mahdi, is, likely, due, to, the, skills, of, his, successor, abd, al, mu, min, 70, ibn, tumart, s, death, was, kept, a, secret, for, three, years, a, period, which, almohad, chroniclers, described, as, a, ghayba, or, occultation, this, period, likely, gave, abd, al, mu, min, time, to, secure, his, position, as, successor, to, the, political, leadership, of, the, movement, 70, although, a, zenata, berber, from, tagra, algeria, and, thus, an, alien, among, the, masmuda, of, southern, morocco, abd, al, mu, min, nonetheless, saw, off, his, principal, rivals, and, hammered, wavering, tribes, back, to, the, fold, three, years, after, ibn, tumart, s, death, he, was, officially, proclaimed, caliph, abd, al, mu, min, then, came, forward, as, the, lieutenant, of, the, mahdi, ibn, tumart, between, 1130, and, his, death, in, 1163, abd, al, mu, min, not, only, rooted, out, the, murabits, almoravids, but, extended, his, power, over, all, northern, africa, as, far, as, egypt, becoming, amir, of, marrakesh, in, 1149, al, andalus, followed, the, fate, of, africa, between, 1146, and, 1173, the, almohads, gradually, wrested, control, from, the, murabits, over, the, moorish, principalities, in, iberia, the, almohads, transferred, the, capital, of, muslim, iberia, from, c, rdoba, to, seville, they, founded, a, great, mosque, there, its, tower, the, giralda, was, erected, in, 1184, to, mark, the, accession, of, ya, qub, i, the, almohads, also, built, a, palace, there, called, al, muwarak, on, the, site, of, the, modern, day, alc, zar, of, seville, the, almohad, princes, had, a, longer, and, more, distinguished, career, than, the, murabits, the, successors, of, abd, al, mumin, abu, yaqub, yusuf, yusuf, i, ruled, 1163, 1184, and, abu, yusuf, yaqub, al, mansur, ya, q, b, i, ruled, 1184, 1199, were, both, able, men, initially, their, government, drove, many, jewish, and, christian, subjects, to, take, refuge, in, the, growing, christian, states, of, portugal, castile, and, aragon, ultimately, they, became, less, fanatical, than, the, murabits, and, ya, qub, al, mansur, was, a, highly, accomplished, man, who, wrote, a, good, arabic, style, and, protected, the, philosopher, averroes, his, title, of, al, man, r, the, victorious, was, earned, by, his, victory, over, alfonso, viii, of, castile, in, the, battle, of, alarcos, 1195, from, the, time, of, yusuf, ii, however, the, almohads, governed, their, co, religionists, in, iberia, and, central, north, africa, through, lieutenants, their, dominions, outside, morocco, being, treated, as, provinces, when, almohad, emirs, crossed, the, straits, it, was, to, lead, a, jihad, against, the, christians, and, then, return, to, morocco, in, 1212, the, almohad, caliph, muhammad, al, nasir, 1199, 1214, the, successor, of, al, mansur, after, an, initially, successful, advance, north, was, defeated, by, an, alliance, of, the, four, christian, kings, of, castile, arag, n, navarre, and, portugal, at, the, battle, of, las, navas, de, tolosa, in, the, sierra, morena, the, battle, broke, the, almohad, advance, but, the, christian, powers, remained, too, disorganized, to, profit, from, it, immediately, before, his, death, in, 1213, al, nasir, appointed, his, young, ten, year, old, son, as, the, next, caliph, yusuf, ii, al, mustansir, the, almohads, passed, through, a, period, of, effective, regency, for, the, young, caliph, with, power, exercised, by, an, oligarchy, of, elder, family, members, palace, bureaucrats, and, leading, nobles, the, almohad, ministers, were, careful, to, negotiate, a, series, of, truces, with, the, christian, kingdoms, which, remained, more, or, less, in, place, for, next, fifteen, years, the, loss, of, alc, cer, do, sal, to, the, kingdom, of, portugal, in, 1217, was, an, exception, in, early, 1224, the, youthful, caliph, died, in, an, accident, without, any, heirs, the, palace, bureaucrats, in, marrakesh, led, by, the, wazir, uthman, ibn, jam, i, quickly, engineered, the, election, of, his, elderly, grand, uncle, abd, al, wahid, i, al, makhlu, as, the, new, almohad, caliph, but, the, rapid, appointment, upset, other, branches, of, the, family, notably, the, brothers, of, the, late, al, nasir, who, governed, in, al, andalus, the, challenge, was, immediately, raised, by, one, of, them, then, governor, in, murcia, who, declared, himself, caliph, abdallah, al, adil, with, the, help, of, his, brothers, he, quickly, seized, control, of, al, andalus, his, chief, advisor, the, shadowy, abu, zayd, ibn, yujjan, tapped, into, his, contacts, in, marrakesh, and, secured, the, deposition, and, assassination, of, abd, al, wahid, i, and, the, expulsion, of, the, al, jami, i, clan, this, coup, has, been, characterized, as, the, pebble, that, finally, broke, al, andalus, it, was, the, first, internal, coup, among, the, almohads, the, almohad, clan, despite, occasional, disagreements, had, always, remained, tightly, knit, and, loyally, behind, dynastic, precedence, caliph, al, adil, s, murderous, breach, of, dynastic, and, constitutional, propriety, marred, his, acceptability, to, other, almohad, sheikhs, one, of, the, recusants, was, his, cousin, abd, allah, al, bayyasi, the, baezan, the, almohad, governor, of, ja, n, who, took, a, handful, of, followers, and, decamped, for, the, hills, around, baeza, he, set, up, a, rebel, camp, and, forged, an, alliance, with, the, hitherto, quiet, ferdinand, iii, of, castile, sensing, his, greater, priority, was, marrakesh, where, recusant, almohad, sheikh, s, had, rallied, behind, yahya, another, son, of, al, nasir, al, adil, paid, little, attention, to, this, little, band, of, misfits, in, 1225, abd, allah, al, bayyasi, s, band, of, rebels, accompanied, by, a, large, castilian, army, descended, from, the, hills, besieging, cities, such, as, ja, n, and, and, jar, they, raided, throughout, the, regions, of, ja, n, cordova, and, vega, de, granada, and, before, the, end, of, the, year, al, bayyasi, had, established, himself, in, the, city, of, cordova, sensing, a, power, vacuum, both, alfonso, ix, of, le, n, and, sancho, ii, of, portugal, opportunistically, ordered, raids, into, andalusian, territory, that, same, year, with, almohad, arms, men, and, cash, dispatched, to, morocco, to, help, caliph, al, adil, impose, himself, in, marrakesh, there, was, little, means, to, stop, the, sudden, onslaught, in, late, 1225, with, surprising, ease, the, portuguese, raiders, reached, the, environs, of, seville, knowing, they, were, outnumbered, the, almohad, governors, of, the, city, refused, to, confront, the, portuguese, raiders, prompting, the, disgusted, population, of, seville, to, take, matters, into, their, own, hands, raise, a, militia, and, go, out, in, the, field, by, themselves, the, result, was, a, veritable, massacre, the, portuguese, men, at, arms, easily, mowed, down, the, throng, of, poorly, armed, townsfolk, thousands, perhaps, as, much, as, 20, 000, were, said, to, have, been, slain, before, the, walls, of, seville, a, similar, disaster, befell, a, similar, popular, levy, by, murcians, at, aspe, that, same, year, but, christian, raiders, had, been, stopped, at, c, ceres, and, requena, trust, in, the, almohad, leadership, was, severely, shaken, by, these, events, the, disasters, were, promptly, blamed, on, the, distractions, of, caliph, al, adil, and, the, incompetence, and, cowardice, of, his, lieutenants, the, successes, credited, to, non, almohad, local, leaders, who, rallied, defenses, but, al, adil, s, fortunes, were, briefly, buoyed, in, payment, for, castilian, assistance, al, bayyasi, had, given, ferdinand, iii, three, strategic, frontier, fortresses, ba, os, de, la, encina, salvatierra, the, old, order, of, calatrava, fortress, near, ciudad, real, and, capilla, but, capilla, refused, to, hand, them, over, forcing, the, castilians, to, lay, a, long, and, difficult, siege, the, brave, defiance, of, little, capilla, and, the, spectacle, of, al, bayyasi, s, shipping, provisions, to, the, castilian, besiegers, shocked, andalusians, and, shifted, sentiment, back, towards, the, almohad, caliph, a, popular, uprising, broke, out, in, cordova, al, bayyasi, was, killed, and, his, head, dispatched, as, a, trophy, to, marrakesh, but, caliph, al, adil, did, not, rejoice, in, this, victory, for, long, he, was, assassinated, in, marrakesh, in, october, 1227, by, the, partisans, of, yahya, who, was, promptly, acclaimed, as, the, new, almohad, caliph, yahya, al, mu, tasim, the, andalusian, branch, of, the, almohads, refused, to, accept, this, turn, of, events, al, adil, s, brother, then, in, seville, proclaimed, himself, the, new, almohad, caliph, abd, al, ala, idris, i, al, ma, mun, he, promptly, purchased, a, truce, from, ferdinand, iii, in, return, for, 300, 000, maravedis, allowing, him, to, organize, and, dispatch, the, greater, part, of, the, almohad, army, in, spain, across, the, straits, in, 1228, to, confront, yahya, that, same, year, portuguese, and, leonese, renewed, their, raids, deep, into, muslim, territory, basically, unchecked, feeling, the, almohads, had, failed, to, protect, them,

muhammad, ibn, yusuf, ibn, hud, al, judhami, who, claimed, descendance, from, the, banu, hud, dynasty, that, had, once, ruled, the, old, taifa, of, saragossa, emerged, as, the, central, figure, of, these, rebellions, systematically, dislodging, almohad, garrisons, through, central, spain, in, october, 1228, with, spain, practically, all, lost, al, ma, mun, abandoned, seville, taking, what, little, remained, of, the, almohad, army, with, him, to, morocco, ibn, hud, immediately, dispatched, emissaries, to, distant, baghdad, to, offer, recognition, to, the, abbasid, caliph, albeit, taking, up, for, himself, a, quasi, caliphal, title, al, mutawwakil, the, departure, of, al, ma, mun, in, 1228, marked, the, end, of, the, almohad, era, in, spain, ibn, hud, and, the, other, local, andalusian, strongmen, were, unable, to, stem, the, rising, flood, of, christian, attacks, launched, almost, yearly, by, sancho, ii, of, portugal, alfonso, ix, of, le, n, ferdinand, iii, of, castile, and, james, i, of, aragon, the, next, twenty, years, saw, a, massive, advance, in, the, christian, reconquista, the, old, great, andalusian, citadels, fell, in, a, grand, sweep, m, rida, and, badajoz,

capital, of, seville, into, christian, hands, in, 1248, ferdinand, iii, of, castile, entered, seville, as, a, conqueror, on, 22, december, 1248, the, andalusians, were, helpless, before, this, onslaught, ibn, hudd, had, attempted, to, check, the, leonese, advance, early, on, but, most, of, his, andalusian, army, was, destroyed, at, the, battle, of, alange, in, 1230, ibn, hud, scrambled, to, move, remaining, arms, and, men, to, save, threatened, or, besieged, andalusian, citadels, but, with, so, many, attacks, at, once, it, was, a, hopeless, endeavor, after, ibn, hud, s, death, in, 1238,

under, the, french, protectorate, based, their, arguments, for, moroccan, independence, on, declarations, such, as, the, atlantic, charter, a, joint, united, states, british, statement, that, set, forth, among, other, things, the, right, of, all, peoples, to, choose, the, form, of, government, under, which, they, live, the, french, regime, also, faced, the, opposition, of, the, tribes, when,
