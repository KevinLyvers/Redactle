tensions, originated, in, long, standing, differences, over, territorial, expansion, in, north, america, and, british, support, for, tecumseh, s, confederacy, which, resisted, u, s, colonial, settlement, in, the, old, northwest, these, escalated, in, 1807, after, the, royal, navy, began, enforcing, tighter, restrictions, on, american, trade, with, france, and, impressed, sailors, who, were, originally, british, subjects, even, those, who, had, acquired, american, citizenship, opinion, in, the, u, s, was, split, on, how, to, respond, and, although, majorities, in, both, the, house, and, senate, voted, for, war, they, divided, along, strict, party, lines, with, the, democratic, republican, party, in, favour, and, the, federalist, party, against, news, of, british, concessions, made, in, an, attempt, to, avoid, war, did, not, reach, the, u, s, until, late, july, by, which, time, the, conflict, was, already, underway, at, sea, the, royal, navy, imposed, an, effective, blockade, on, u, s, maritime, trade, while, between, 1812, and, 1814, british, regulars, and, colonial, militia, defeated, a, series, of, american, invasions, on, upper, canada, the, april, 1814,

american, troops, repulsed, a, major, british, attack, on, new, orleans, which, occurred, during, the, ratification, process, of, the, signing, of, treaty, of, ghent, which, brought, an, end, to, the, conflict, since, the, conclusion, of, the, war, of, 1812, historians, have, long, debated, the, relative, weight, of, the, multiple, reasons, underlying, its, origins, during, the, 19th, century, historians, generally, concluded, that, war, was, declared, largely, over, national, honour, neutral, maritime, rights, and, the, british, seizure, of, neutral, ships, and, their, cargoes, on, the, high, seas, this, theme, was, the, basis, of, president, james, madison, s, war, message, to, congress, on, june, 1, 1812, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, much, of, the, contemporary, scholarship, re, evaluated, this, explanation, and, began, to, focus, more, on, non, maritime, factors, as, significant, contributing, causes, as, well, however, historian, warren, h, goodman, warns, that, too, much, focus, on, these, ideas, can, be, equally, misleading, in, disagreeing, with, those, interpretations, that, have, simply, stressed, expansionism, and, minimized, maritime, causation, historians, have, ignored, deep, seated, american, fears, for, national, security, dreams, of, a, continent, completely, controlled, by, the, republican, united, states, and, the, evidence, that, many, americans, believed, that, the, war, of, 1812, would, be, the, occasion, for, the, united, states, to, achieve, the, long, desired, annexation, of, canada, thomas, jefferson, well, summarized, american, majority, opinion, about, the, war, to, say, that, the, cession, of, canada, must, be, a, sine, qua, non, at, a, treaty, of, peace, horsman, historian, richard, maass, argues, that, the, expansionist, theme, is, a, myth, that, goes, against, the, relative, consensus, among, experts, that, the, primary, american, objective, was, the, repeal, of, british, maritime, restrictions, he, says, that, scholars, agree, that, the, united, states, went, to, war, because, six, years, of, economic, sanctions, had, failed, to, bring, britain, to, the, negotiating, table, and, threatening, the, royal, navy, s, canadian, supply, base, was, their, last, hope, maass, agrees, that, expansionism, might, have, tempted, americans, on, a, theoretical, level, but, he, finds, that, leaders, feared, the, domestic, political, consequences, of, doing, so, particularly, because, such, expansion, focused, on, sparsely, populated, western, lands, rather, than, the, more, populous, eastern, settlements, to, what, extent, that, american, leaders, considered, the, question, of, pursuing, territory, in, canada, those, questions, arose, as, a, result, of, the, war, rather, than, as, a, driving, cause, however, maass, accepts, that, many, historians, continue, to, believe, that, expansionism, was, a, cause, reginald, horsman, sees, expansionism, as, a, secondary, cause, after, maritime, issues, noting, that, many, historians, have, mistakenly, rejected, expansionism, as, a, cause, for, the, war, he, notes, that, it, was, considered, key, to, maintaining, sectional, balance, between, free, and, slave, states, thrown, off, by, american, settlement, of, the, louisiana, territory, and, widely, supported, by, dozens, of, war, hawk, congressmen, such, as, henry, clay, felix, grundy, john, adams, harper, and, richard, mentor, johnson, who, voted, for, war, with, expansion, as, a, key, aim, however, horsman, states, that, in, his, view, the, desire, for, canada, did, not, cause, the, war, of, 1812, and, that, the, united, states, did, not, declare, war, because, it, wanted, to, obtain, canada, but, the, acquisition, of, canada, was, viewed, as, a, major, collateral, benefit, of, the, conflict, however, other, historians, believe, that, a, desire, to, permanently, annex, canada, was, a, direct, cause, of, the, war, carl, benn, notes, that, the, war, hawks, desire, to, annex, the, canadas, was, similar, to, the, enthusiasm, for, the, annexation, of, spanish, florida, by, inhabitants, of, the, american, south, as, both, expected, war, to, facilitate, expansion, into, long, desired, lands, and, end, support, for, hostile, tribes, tecumseh, s, confederacy, in, the, north, and, the, creek, in, the, south, alan, taylor, says, that, many, democratic, republican, congressmen, such, as, john, adams, harper, richard, mentor, johnson, and, peter, buell, porter, longed, to, oust, the, british, from, the, continent, and, to, annex, canada, a, few, southerners, opposed, this, fearing, an, imbalance, of, free, and, slave, states, if, canada, was, annexed, anti, catholicism, also, caused, many, to, oppose, annexing, the, mainly, catholic, lower, canada, believing, its, french, speaking, inhabitants, unfit, for, republican, citizenship, even, major, figures, such, as, henry, clay, and, james, monroe, expected, to, keep, at, least, upper, canada, in, an, easy, conquest, notable, american, generals, such, as, william, hull, issued, proclamations, to, canadians, during, the, war, promising, republican, liberation, through, incorporation, into, the, united, states, general, alexander, smyth, similarly, declared, to, his, troops, when, they, invaded, canada, that, you, will, enter, a, country, that, is, to, become, one, of, the, united, states, you, will, arrive, among, a, people, who, are, to, become, your, fellow, citizens, however, a, lack, of, clarity, about, american, intentions, undercut, these, appeals, david, and, jeanne, heidler, argue, that, most, historians, agree, that, the, war, of, 1812, was, not, caused, by, expansionism, but, instead, reflected, a, real, concern, of, american, patriots, to, defend, united, states, neutral, rights, from, the, overbearing, tyranny, of, the, british, navy, that, is, not, to, say, that, expansionist, aims, would, not, potentially, result, from, the, war, however, they, also, argue, otherwise, saying, that, acquiring, canada, would, satisfy, america, s, expansionist, desires, also, describing, it, as, a, key, goal, of, western, expansionists, who, they, argue, believed, that, eliminating, the, british, presence, in, canada, would, best, accomplish, their, goal, of, halting, british, support, for, tribal, raids, they, argue, that, the, enduring, debate, is, over, the, relative, importance, of, expansionism, as, a, factor, and, whether, expansionism, played, a, greater, role, in, causing, the, war, of, 1812, than, american, concern, about, protecting, neutral, maritime, rights, in, the, 1960s, the, work, of, norman, k, risjord, reginald, horsman, bradford, perkins, and, roger, brown, established, a, new, eastern, maritime, consensus, while, these, authors, approached, the, origins, of, the, war, from, many, perspectives, they, all, conceded, that, british, maritime, policy, was, the, principal, cause, of, the, war, as, historian, norman, risjord, notes, a, powerful, motivation, for, the, americans, was, their, threatened, sense, of, independence, and, the, desire, to, uphold, national, honour, in, the, face, of, what, they, considered, british, aggression, and, insults, such, as, the, chesapeake, leopard, affair, h, w, brands, writes, the, other, war, hawks, spoke, of, the, struggle, with, britain, as, a, second, war, of, independence, jackson, who, still, bore, scars, from, the, first, war, of, independence, held, that, view, with, special, conviction, the, approaching, conflict, was, about, violations, of, american, rights, but, it, was, also, about, vindication, of, american, identity, some, americans, at, the, time, and, some, historians, since, have, called, it, a, second, war, of, independence, for, the, united, states, the, young, republic, had, been, involved, in, several, struggles, to, uphold, what, it, regarded, as, its, rights, and, honour, as, an, independent, nation, the, first, barbary, war, had, resulted, in, an, apparent, victory, but, with, the, continued, payment, of, ransoms, the, quasi, war, against, the, french, had, involved, single, ship, naval, clashes, over, trade, rights, similar, to, the, ones, about, to, occur, with, britain, upholding, national, honour, and, being, able, to, protect, american, rights, was, part, of, the, background, to, the, us, political, and, diplomatic, attitudes, towards, britain, in, the, early, 1800s, at, the, same, time, the, british, public, were, offended, by, what, they, considered, insults, such, as, the, little, belt, affair, this, gave, them, a, particular, interest, in, capturing, the, american, flagship, president, an, act, that, they, successfully, realized, in, 1815, they, were, also, keen, to, maintain, what, they, saw, as, their, rights, to, stop, and, search, neutral, vessels, as, part, of, their, war, with, france, and, further, ensure, that, their, own, commercial, interests, were, protected, britain, was, the, largest, trading, partner, of, the, united, states, receiving, 80, percent, of, american, cotton, and, 50, percent, of, all, other, american, exports, the, british, public, and, press, resented, the, growing, mercantile, and, commercial, competition, historian, reginald, horsman, states, that, a, large, section, of, influential, british, opinion, thought, that, the, united, states, presented, a, threat, to, british, maritime, supremacy, during, the, seven, years, war, britain, introduced, rules, governing, trade, with, their, enemies, the, rule, of, 1756, which, the, u, s, had, temporarily, agreed, to, when, signing, the, jay, treaty, stated, that, a, neutral, nation, could, not, conduct, trade, with, an, enemy, if, that, trade, was, closed, to, them, before, hostilities, had, commenced, since, the, beginning, of, britain, s, war, with, france, in, 1793, the, u, s, merchant, marine, had, been, making, a, fortune, continuing, trading, with, both, nations, america, s, share, of, trans, atlantic, trade, growing, from, 250, thousand, tons, in, 1790, to, 981, thousand, tons, in, 1810, in, the, process, of, particular, concern, to, the, british, was, the, transport, of, goods, from, the, french, west, indies, to, france, something, the, u, s, would, have, been, unable, to, do, due, to, french, rules, during, times, of, peace, the, united, states, view, was, that, the, treaty, they, had, signed, violated, their, right, to, trade, with, others, and, in, order, to, circumvent, the, rule, of, 1756, american, ships, would, stop, at, a, neutral, port, to, unload, and, reload, their, cargo, before, continuing, to, france, these, actions, were, challenged, in, the, essex, case, of, 1805, with, parts, of, the, jay, treaty, due, to, expire, in, 1806, a, new, agreement, was, sought, the, monroe, pinkney, treaty, offered, the, u, s, preferential, trading, rights, and, would, have, settled, most, of, its, issues, with, britain, however, the, treaty, did, not, moderate, the, rule, of, 1756, and, only, offered, to, exercise, extreme, caution, and, immediate, and, prompt, redress, with, regard, to, impressment, of, americans, president, thomas, jefferson, who, had, specifically, asked, for, these, two, points, to, be, extirpated, refused, to, put, the, treaty, before, the, senate, in, 1806, napoleon, s, berlin, decree, declared, a, blockade, of, the, british, isles, forbade, neutral, vessels, harbour, in, british, ports, and, declared, all, british, made, goods, carried, on, neutral, ships, lawful, prizes, of, war, the, british, responded, in, 1807, with, orders, in, council, which, similarly, forbade, any, shipping, to, france, by, 1807, when, napoleon, introduced, his, milan, decree, declaring, all, ships, touching, at, british, ports, to, be, legitimate, prizes, of, war, it, had, become, almost, impossible, for, the, u, s, to, remain, neutral, between, 1804, and, 1807, 731, american, ships, were, seized, by, britain, or, france, for, violation, of, one, of, the, blockades, roughly, two, thirds, by, britain, since, the, jay, treaty, france, had, also, adopted, an, aggressive, attitude, to, american, neutrality, while, britain, through, a, process, known, as, pre, emption, compensated, american, ship, owners, for, their, losses, france, did, not, french, frigates, burned, american, grain, ships, heading, for, britain, and, treated, american, sailors, as, prisoners, of, war, us, french, relations, had, soured, so, much, that, by, 1812, madison, was, also, considering, war, with, france, as, a, result, of, these, increasing, trade, volumes, during, the, napoleonic, wars, the, united, states, merchant, marine, became, the, world, s, largest, neutral, shipping, fleet, between, 1802, and, 1810, it, nearly, doubled, which, meant, that, there, were, insufficient, numbers, of, experienced, sailors, in, the, united, states, to, man, it, to, overcome, this, shortfall, british, seamen, were, recruited, who, were, attracted, by, the, better, pay, and, conditions, it, was, estimated, that, 30, 23, 000, of, the, 70, 000, men, employed, on, american, ships, were, british, during, the, napoleonic, wars, the, british, royal, navy, expanded, to, 600, ships, requiring, 140, 000, sailors, the, royal, navy, could, man, its, ships, with, volunteers, in, peacetime, but, in, wartime, competing, with, merchant, shipping, and, privateers, for, the, pool, of, experienced, sailors, it, turned, to, impressment, from, ashore, and, at, sea, since, 1795, the, quota, system, had, been, in, use, to, feed, men, to, the, navy, but, it, was, not, alone, sufficient, though, most, saw, it, as, necessary, the, practice, of, impressment, was, detested, by, most, britons, it, was, illegal, under, british, law, to, impress, foreign, sailors, but, it, was, the, accepted, practice, of, the, era, for, nations, to, retrieve, seamen, of, their, own, nationality, from, foreign, navies, during, times, of, war, however, in, the, nineteen, years, britain, was, at, war, with, france, prior, to, the, war, of, 1812, some, ten, thousand, american, citizens, were, impressed, into, the, british, navy, the, american, ambassador, in, london, james, monroe, under, president, jefferson, protested, to, the, british, foreign, office, that, more, than, fifteen, thousand, americans, had, been, impressed, into, the, royal, navy, since, march, 1803, when, asked, for, a, list, however, the, madison, administration, was, only, able, to, produce, one, based, on, hearsay, containing, 6, 257, names, many, of, which, were, duplicated, the, list, also, included, some, who, had, legitimately, volunteered, to, serve, by, 1804, the, incidents, of, impressment, of, americans, had, sharply, increased, underlying, the, dispute, was, the, issue, that, britain, and, the, united, states, viewed, nationality, differently, the, united, states, believed, that, british, seamen, including, naval, deserters, had, a, right, to, become, american, citizens, in, reality, few, actually, went, through, the, formal, process, regardless, britain, did, not, recognize, a, right, for, a, british, subject, to, relinquish, his, citizenship, and, become, a, citizen, of, another, country, the, royal, navy, therefore, considered, any, american, citizen, subject, to, impressment, if, he, was, born, british, american, reluctance, to, issue, formal, naturalization, papers, and, the, widespread, use, of, unofficial, or, forged, identity, or, protection, papers, among, sailors, made, it, difficult, for, the, royal, navy, to, tell, native, born, americans, from, naturalized, americans, and, even, non, americans, and, led, it, to, impress, some, american, sailors, who, had, never, been, british, though, britain, was, willing, to, release, from, service, anyone, who, could, establish, their, american, citizenship, the, process, often, took, years, while, the, men, in, question, remained, impressed, in, the, british, navy, however, from, 1793, to, 1812, up, to, 15, 000, americans, had, been, impressed, while, many, appeals, for, release, were, simply, ignored, or, dismissed, for, other, reasons, there, were, also, cases, when, the, united, states, navy, also, impressed, british, sailors, once, impressed, any, seaman, regardless, of, citizenship, could, accept, a, recruitment, bounty, and, was, then, no, longer, considered, impressed, but, a, volunteer, further, complicating, matters, american, anger, with, britain, grew, when, royal, navy, frigates, were, stationed, just, outside, american, harbours, in, view, of, american, shores, to, search, ships, for, goods, bound, to, france, and, impress, men, within, the, united, states, territorial, waters, well, publicized, events, outraged, the, american, public, such, as, the, leander, affair, and, the, chesapeake, leopard, affair, the, british, public, were, outraged, by, the, little, belt, affair, in, which, the, larger, uss, president, in, search, of, hms, guerriere, instead, clashed, with, a, small, british, sloop, resulting, in, the, deaths, of, 11, british, sailors, while, both, sides, claimed, the, other, fired, first, the, british, public, particularly, blamed, the, united, states, for, attacking, a, smaller, vessel, with, calls, in, some, newspapers, for, revenge, president, had, sighted, and, chased, hms, little, belt, trying, to, determine, her, identity, throughout, the, afternoon, the, first, shot, took, place, after, an, exchange, of, hails, had, still, failed, to, identify, either, ship, to, the, other, in, the, growing, dusk, after, 45, minutes, of, battle, taking, place, in, darkness, little, belt, had, received, much, damage, with, several, holes, to, her, hull, near, the, water, line, and, her, rigging, cut, to, pieces, president, s, captain, rodgers, claimed, little, belt, had, fired, first, but, he, did, not, ascertain, her, size, or, country, of, origin, until, dawn, after, sending, over, a, boat, rodgers, expressed, regret, and, apologized, for, the, unfortunate, affair, little, belt, s, captain, bingham, claimed, the, opposite, president, had, fired, first, and, had, been, manoeuvering, in, such, a, way, as, to, make, him, think, she, was, planning, an, attack, historian, jonathon, hooks, echoes, the, view, of, alfred, t, mahan, and, several, other, historians, that, it, is, impossible, to, determine, who, fired, the, first, shot, both, sides, held, inquiries, which, upheld, their, captain, s, actions, and, version, of, events, meanwhile, the, american, public, regarded, the, incident, as, just, retribution, for, the, chesapeake, leopard, affair, and, were, encouraged, by, their, victory, over, the, royal, navy, while, the, british, regarded, it, as, unprovoked, aggression, whether, the, annexation, of, canada, was, a, primary, american, war, objective, has, been, debated, by, historians, some, argue, it, was, an, outcome, of, the, failure, to, change, british, policy, through, economic, coercion, or, negotiation, leaving, invasion, as, the, only, way, for, the, us, to, place, pressure, on, britain, this, view, was, summarized, by, secretary, of, state, james, monroe, who, said, t, might, be, necessary, to, invade, canada, not, as, an, object, of, the, war, but, as, a, means, to, bring, it, to, a, satisfactory, conclusion, occupation, would, also, disrupt, supplies, to, colonies, in, the, british, west, indies, and, royal, navy, and, prevent, the, british, arming, their, allies, among, the, indian, nations, of, the, old, northwest, nevertheless, even, though, president, madison, claimed, permanent, annexation, was, not, an, objective, he, recognized, once, acquired, it, would, be, difficult, to, relinquish, a, large, faction, in, congress, actively, advocated, this, policy, including, richard, johnson, who, stated, i, shall, never, die, content, until, i, see, england, s, expulsion, from, north, america, and, her, territories, incorporated, into, the, united, states, john, harper, claimed, the, author, of, nature, himself, had, marked, our, limits, in, the, south, by, the, gulf, of, mexico, and, on, the, north, by, the, regions, of, eternal, frost, both, saw, the, war, as, part, of, a, divine, plan, to, unify, the, us, and, canada, johnson, being, its, leading, exponent, others, considered, annexation, a, matter, of, domestic, economic, and, political, necessity, tennessee, congressman, felix, grundy, was, one, of, many, who, saw, it, as, essential, to, preserve, the, balance, between, slave, states, and, free, states, that, might, be, disrupted, by, the, incorporation, of, territories, in, the, southeast, acquired, in, the, 1803, louisiana, purchase, control, of, the, st, lawrence, river, the, major, outlet, for, trade, between, europe, and, the, great, lakes, region, was, a, long, standing, american, ambition, going, back, to, the, early, years, of, the, revolutionary, war, and, supported, by, powerful, economic, interests, in, the, north, west, madison, also, viewed, it, as, a, way, to, prevent, american, smugglers, using, the, river, as, a, conduit, for, undercutting, his, trade, policies, all, these, groups, assumed, american, troops, would, be, greeted, as, liberators, guaranteeing, an, easy, conquest, jefferson, believed, taking, canada, this, year, as, far, as, quebec, will, be, a, mere, matter, of, marching, and, will, give, us, the, experience, for, the, attack, on, halifax, the, next, and, final, expulsion, of, england, from, the, american, continent, in, 1812, canada, had, around, 525, 000, inhabitants, two, thirds, of, whom, were, french, speakers, living, in, quebec, upper, canada, now, southern, ontario, had, a, population, of, less, than, 75, 000, primarily, loyalist, exiles, and, recent, immigrants, from, the, northeastern, united, states, the, former, were, implacably, hostile, to, the, united, states, the, latter, largely, uninterested, in, politics, and, their, loyalties, unknown, unlike, the, texas, annexation, in, 1845, they, were, too, few, to, provide, a, critical, mass, of, pro, american, support, while, many, followed, their, loyalist, neighbours, and, joined, canadian, militia, absence, of, local, backing, prevented, american, forces, from, establishing, a, foothold, in, the, area, and, of, ten, attempts, to, invade, upper, canada, between, 1812, and, 1814, the, vast, majority, ended, in, failure, the, old, northwest, a, region, between, the, great, lakes, the, ohio, river, appalachians, and, the, mississippi, was, a, long, standing, source, of, conflict, in, 18th, and, early, 19th, century, north, america, this, arose, when, settlers, from, the, thirteen, colonies, moved, onto, lands, owned, by, the, indigenous, inhabitants, a, collection, of, algonquian, and, iroquoian, speaking, peoples, chiefly, the, shawnee, wyandot, lenape, miami, potawatomi, kickapoo, menominee, and, odawa, in, 1783, the, british, ceded, the, old, northwest, to, the, united, states, which, encouraged, its, citizens, to, settle, in, the, region, and, ignored, the, rights, of, the, tribes, that, inhabited, it, in, response, the, tribes, formed, the, northwestern, confederacy, which, fought, american, expansion, in, the, northwest, indian, war, with, military, support, from, the, british, after, signing, the, jay, treaty, with, the, us, in, 1794, the, british, abandoned, the, tribes, of, the, old, northwest, who, signed, the, 1795, treaty, of, greenville, with, the, american, government, under, the, treaty, they, ceded, most, of, what, is, now, the, state, of, ohio, to, the, us, but, were, granted, title, to, the, rest, of, their, lands, in, perpetuity, when, it, signed, the, treaty, the, american, government, had, already, decided, to, violate, this, provision, and, continue, expanding, into, the, old, northwest, a, key, factor, in, this, policy, was, the, acquisition, by, france, of, the, louisiana, territory, in, 1800, which, meant, the, u, s, faced, an, expansionist, power, on, its, northwestern, border, rather, than, a, weak, spain, to, ensure, control, of, the, upper, mississippi, river, jefferson, incorporated, the, region, into, the, indiana, territory, which, originally, contained, the, modern, states, of, indiana, illinois, michigan, and, wisconsin, he, appointed, william, henry, harrison, as, governor, ordering, him, to, acquire, as, much, land, as, possible, beyond, the, greenville, line, using, deception, if, needed, in, doing, so, harrison, was, helped, by, vague, and, competing, claims, since, tribes, whose, title, to, the, lands, was, either, limited, or, disputed, were, happy, to, sign, them, away, in, return, for, bribes, although, the, december, 1803, louisiana, purchase, ended, the, french, threat, between, 1803, and, 1805, he, obtained, extensive, territorial, cessions, in, the, treaties, of, fort, wayne, 1803, st, louis, vincennes, and, grouseland, the, policies, adopted, by, harrison, meant, low, level, conflict, between, local, tribes, and, american, settlers, quickly, escalated, post, 1803, in, 1805, a, shawnee, leader, named, tenskwatawa, launched, a, nativist, religious, movement, that, rejected, american, culture, and, values, while, his, elder, brother, tecumseh, organized, a, new, confederacy, to, defend, their, territory, against, settler, encroachment, they, established, a, community, at, prophetstown, in, 1808, gaining, support, from, young, warriors, and, traditional, chiefs, including, the, wyandot, leader, roundhead, and, main, poc, from, the, potawatomi, the, sioux, sauk, meskwaki, and, ojibwe, peoples, who, lived, along, the, upper, mississippi, and, western, great, lakes, initially, rejected, tenskwatawa, s, message, because, of, their, dependence, on, the, fur, trade, but, continued, settler, incursions, into, their, lands, meant, they, too, became, hostile, to, the, u, s, britain, traditionally, maintained, good, relations, with, the, tribes, of, the, old, northwest, by, handing, out, gifts, including, arms, and, ammunition, after, 1795, they, ended, this, policy, and, advised, the, tribes, to, live, peacefully, with, the, american, government, after, the, chesapeake, leopard, affair, in, 1808, the, british, government, began, to, view, the, old, northwest, as, a, buffer, against, an, american, attack, on, upper, canada, they, re, started, the, distribution, of, gifts, and, offered, the, tribes, a, defensive, alliance, if, war, broke, out, with, the, u, s, while, urging, them, to, refrain, from, aggressive, action, in, the, meantime, in, 1809, harrison, acquired, a, large, cession, of, land, from, the, delaware, and, miami, in, the, treaty, of, fort, wayne, partly, by, distributing, hundreds, of, gallons, of, whiskey, to, the, delaware, and, miami, negotiators, the, cession, included, lands, claimed, by, the, shawnee, tecumseh, insisted, it, was, invalid, without, the, consent, of, all, the, tribes, in, 1811, alarmed, at, the, threat, posed, by, tecumseh, and, tenskwatawa, harrison, secured, permission, from, the, federal, government, to, attack, them, taking, advantage, of, tecumseh, s, absence, he, marched, on, prophetstown, with, an, army, of, nearly, 1, 000, men, in, the, ensuing, battle, of, tippecanoe, the, americans, first, repulsed, an, attack, by, forces, under, tenskwatawa, then, destroyed, prophetstown, fighting, along, the, frontier, escalated, while, tecumseh, reconstituted, his, confederacy, and, allied, with, the, british, many, americans, blamed, the, british, rather, than, their, own, policy, of, expansion, for, the, conflict, in, the, old, northwest, during, the, war, of, 1812, most, of, the, tribes, of, the, old, northwest, supported, the, british, including, the, previously, neutral, tribes, of, the, upper, mississippi, the, united, states, was, in, a, period, of, significant, political, conflict, between, the, federalist, party, based, mainly, in, the, northeast, and, the, democratic, republican, party, with, its, greatest, power, base, in, the, south, and, west, the, federalists, who, favoured, a, strong, central, government, and, openly, sympathized, with, britain, in, their, struggle, against, napoleonic, france, were, criticized, by, the, democratic, republicans, for, being, too, close, to, britain, while, the, federalists, countered, that, the, democratic, republicans, were, allied, to, france, a, country, headed, by, napoleon, who, was, seen, as, a, dictator, by, 1812, the, republicans, who, were, seen, as, being, more, supportive, of, western, expansionism, believed, that, the, federalists, in, new, england, were, conspiring, with, the, british, who, were, forming, alliances, with, the, various, frontier, indian, tribes, while, recruiting, late, loyalists, in, canada, to, break, up, the, union, instead, the, war, served, to, alienate, the, federalists, who, were, ready, to, trade, and, even, smuggle, with, the, british, rather, than, to, fight, them, by, 1812, the, federalist, party, had, weakened, considerably, and, the, republicans, were, in, a, strong, position, with, james, madison, completing, his, first, term, of, office, and, control, of, congress, support, for, the, american, cause, was, weak, in, federalist, areas, of, the, northeast, throughout, the, war, as, fewer, men, volunteered, to, serve, and, the, banks, avoided, financing, the, war, the, negativism, of, the, federalists, ruined, the, party, s, reputation, post, war, as, exemplified, by, the, hartford, convention, of, 1814, 1815, and, the, party, survived, only, in, scattered, areas, by, 1815, after, the, victory, at, the, battle, of, new, orleans, there, was, broad, support, for, the, war, from, all, parts, of, the, country, this, allowed, the, triumphant, democratic, republicans, to, adopt, some, federalist, policies, such, as, the, national, bank, which, madison, re, established, in, 1816, during, the, years, 1810, 1812, american, naval, ships, were, divided, into, two, major, squadrons, with, the, northern, division, based, at, new, york, commanded, by, commodore, john, rodgers, and, the, southern, division, based, at, norfolk, commanded, by, commodore, stephen, decatur, although, not, much, of, a, threat, to, canada, in, 1812, the, united, states, navy, was, a, well, trained, and, professional, force, comprising, over, 5, 000, sailors, and, marines, it, had, 14, ocean, going, warships, with, three, of, its, five, super, frigates, non, operational, at, the, onset, of, the, war, its, principal, problem, was, lack, of, funding, as, many, in, congress, did, not, see, the, need, for, a, strong, navy, the, biggest, ships, in, the, american, navy, were, frigates, and, there, were, no, ships, of, the, line, capable, of, engaging, in, a, fleet, action, with, the, royal, navy, on, the, high, seas, the, americans, pursued, a, strategy, of, commerce, raiding, capturing, or, sinking, british, merchantmen, with, their, frigates, and, privateers, the, navy, was, largely, concentrated, on, the, atlantic, coast, before, the, war, as, it, had, only, two, gunboats, on, lake, champlain, one, brig, on, lake, ontario, and, another, brig, in, lake, erie, when, the, war, began, the, united, states, army, was, initially, much, larger, than, the, british, army, in, north, america, many, men, carried, their, own, long, rifles, while, the, british, were, issued, muskets, except, for, one, unit, of, 500, riflemen, leadership, was, inconsistent, in, the, american, officer, corps, as, some, officers, proved, themselves, to, be, outstanding, but, many, others, were, inept, owing, their, positions, to, political, favours, congress, was, hostile, to, a, standing, army, and, the, government, called, out, 450, 000, men, from, the, state, militias, during, the, war, the, state, militias, were, poorly, trained, armed, and, led, the, failed, invasion, of, lake, champlain, led, by, general, dearborn, illustrates, this, the, british, army, soundly, defeated, the, maryland, and, virginia, militias, at, the, battle, of, bladensburg, in, 1814, and, president, madison, commented, i, could, never, have, believed, so, great, a, difference, existed, between, regular, troops, and, a, militia, force, if, i, had, not, witnessed, the, scenes, of, this, day, the, united, states, was, only, a, secondary, concern, to, britain, so, long, as, the, war, continued, with, france, in, 1813, france, had, 80, ships, of, the, line, and, was, building, another, 35, containing, the, french, fleet, was, the, main, british, naval, concern, leaving, only, the, ships, on, the, north, american, and, jamaica, stations, immediately, available, in, upper, canada, the, british, had, the, provincial, marine, while, largely, unarmed, they, were, essential, for, keeping, the, army, supplied, since, the, roads, were, abysmal, in, upper, canada, at, the, onset, of, war, the, provincial, marine, had, four, small, armed, vessels, on, lake, ontario, three, on, lake, erie, and, one, on, lake, champlain, the, provincial, marine, greatly, outnumbered, anything, the, americans, could, bring, to, bear, on, the, great, lakes, when, the, war, broke, out, the, british, army, in, north, america, numbered, 9, 777, men, in, regular, units, and, fencibles, while, the, british, army, was, engaged, in, the, peninsular, war, few, reinforcements, were, available, although, the, british, were, outnumbered, the, long, serving, regulars, and, fencibles, were, better, trained, and, more, professional, than, the, hastily, expanded, united, states, army, the, militias, of, upper, canada, and, lower, canada, were, initially, far, less, effective, but, substantial, numbers, of, full, time, militia, were, raised, during, the, war, and, played, pivotal, roles, in, several, engagements, including, the, battle, of, the, chateauguay, which, caused, the, americans, to, abandon, the, saint, lawrence, river, theatre, the, highly, decentralized, bands, and, tribes, considered, themselves, allies, of, and, not, subordinates, to, the, british, or, the, americans, various, indian, tribes, fighting, with, united, states, forces, provided, them, with, their, most, effective, light, troops, while, the, british, needed, indigenous, allies, to, compensate, for, their, numerical, inferiority, the, indigenous, allies, of, the, british, tecumseh, s, confederacy, in, the, west, and, iroquois, in, the, east, avoided, pitched, battles, and, relied, on, irregular, warfare, including, raids, and, ambushes, that, took, advantage, of, their, knowledge, of, terrain, in, addition, they, were, highly, mobile, able, to, march, 30, 50, miles, 50, 80, km, a, day, their, leaders, sought, to, fight, only, under, favourable, conditions, and, would, avoid, any, battle, that, promised, heavy, losses, doing, what, they, thought, best, for, their, tribes, much, to, the, annoyance, of, both, american, and, british, generals, the, indigenous, fighters, saw, no, issue, with, withdrawing, if, needed, to, save, casualties, they, always, sought, to, surround, an, enemy, where, possible, to, avoid, being, surrounded, and, make, effective, use, of, the, terrain, their, main, weapons, were, a, mixture, of, muskets, rifles, bows, tomahawks, knives, and, swords, as, well, as, clubs, and, other, melee, weapons, which, sometimes, had, the, advantage, of, being, quieter, than, guns, on, 1, june, 1812, madison, sent, a, message, to, congress, recounting, american, grievances, against, great, britain, though, not, specifically, calling, for, a, declaration, of, war, the, house, of, representatives, then, deliberated, for, four, days, behind, closed, doors, before, voting, 79, to, 49, 61, in, favour, of, the, first, declaration, of, war, the, senate, concurred, in, the, declaration, by, a, 19, to, 13, 59, vote, in, favour, the, declaration, focused, mostly, on, maritime, issues, especially, involving, british, blockades, with, two, thirds, of, the, indictment, devoted, to, such, impositions, initiated, by, britain, s, orders, in, council, the, conflict, began, formally, on, 18, june, 1812, when, madison, signed, the, measure, into, law, he, proclaimed, it, the, next, day, this, was, the, first, time, that, the, united, states, had, declared, war, on, another, nation, and, the, congressional, vote, was, the, closest, vote, in, american, history, to, formally, declare, war, none, of, the, 39, federalists, in, congress, voted, in, favour, of, the, war, while, other, critics, referred, to, it, as, mr, madison, s, war, just, days, after, war, had, been, declared, a, small, number, of, federalists, in, baltimore, were, attacked, for, printing, anti, war, views, in, a, newspaper, which, eventually, led, to, over, a, month, of, deadly, rioting, in, the, city, prime, minister, spencer, perceval, was, assassinated, in, london, on, 11, may, and, lord, liverpool, came, to, power, he, wanted, a, more, practical, relationship, with, the, united, states, on, june, 23, he, issued, a, repeal, of, the, orders, in, council, but, the, united, states, was, unaware, of, this, as, it, took, three, weeks, for, the, news, to, cross, the, atlantic, on, 28, june, 1812, hms, colibri, was, dispatched, from, halifax, to, new, york, under, a, flag, of, truce, she, anchored, off, sandy, hook, on, july, 9, and, left, three, days, later, carrying, a, copy, of, the, declaration, of, war, british, ambassador, to, the, united, states, augustus, foster, and, consul, colonel, thomas, henry, barclay, she, arrived, in, halifax, nova, scotia, eight, days, later, the, news, of, the, declaration, took, even, longer, to, reach, london, british, commander, isaac, brock, in, upper, canada, received, the, news, much, faster, he, issued, a, proclamation, alerting, citizens, to, the, state, of, war, and, urging, all, military, personnel, to, be, vigilant, in, the, discharge, of, their, duty, so, as, to, prevent, communication, with, the, enemy, and, to, arrest, anyone, suspected, of, helping, the, americans, he, also, ordered, the, british, garrison, of, fort, st, joseph, on, lake, huron, to, capture, the, american, fort, at, mackinac, this, fort, commanded, the, passage, between, lakes, huron, and, michigan, which, was, important, to, the, fur, trade, the, british, garrison, aided, by, fur, traders, of, the, north, west, company, and, sioux, menominee, winnebago, chippewa, and, ottawa, immediately, besieged, and, captured, mackinac, the, war, was, conducted, in, several, theatres, the, war, had, been, preceded, by, years, of, diplomatic, dispute, yet, neither, side, was, ready, for, war, when, it, came, britain, was, heavily, engaged, in, the, napoleonic, wars, most, of, the, british, army, was, deployed, in, the, peninsular, war, in, portugal, and, spain, and, the, royal, navy, was, blockading, most, of, the, coast, of, europe, the, number, of, british, regular, troops, present, in, canada, in, july, 1812, was, officially, 6, 034, supported, by, additional, canadian, militia, throughout, the, war, the, british, war, secretary, was, earl, bathurst, who, had, few, troops, to, spare, for, reinforcing, north, america, defences, during, the, first, two, years, of, the, war, he, urged, lieutenant, general, george, pr, vost, to, maintain, a, defensive, strategy, pr, vost, who, had, the, trust, of, the, canadians, followed, these, instructions, and, concentrated, on, defending, lower, canada, at, the, expense, of, upper, canada, which, was, more, vulnerable, to, american, attacks, and, allowed, few, offensive, actions, unlike, campaigns, along, the, east, coast, prevost, had, to, operate, with, no, support, from, the, royal, navy, the, united, states, was, also, not, prepared, for, war, madison, had, assumed, that, the, state, militias, would, easily, seize, canada, and, that, negotiations, would, follow, in, 1812, the, regular, army, consisted, of, fewer, than, 12, 000, men, congress, authorized, the, expansion, of, the, army, to, 35, 000, men, but, the, service, was, voluntary, and, unpopular, it, paid, poorly, and, there, were, initially, few, trained, and, experienced, officers, the, militia, objected, to, serving, outside, their, home, states, they, were, undisciplined, and, performed, poorly, against, british, forces, when, called, upon, to, fight, in, unfamiliar, territory, multiple, militias, refused, orders, to, cross, the, border, and, fight, on, canadian, soil, american, prosecution, of, the, war, suffered, from, its, unpopularity, especially, in, new, england, where, anti, war, speakers, were, vocal, massachusetts, congressmen, ebenezer, seaver, and, william, widgery, were, publicly, insulted, and, hissed, in, boston, while, a, mob, seized, plymouth, s, chief, justice, charles, turner, on, 3, august, 1812, and, kicked, through, the, town, the, united, states, had, great, difficulty, financing, its, war, it, had, disbanded, its, national, bank, and, private, bankers, in, the, northeast, were, opposed, to, the, war, but, it, obtained, financing, from, london, based, barings, bank, to, cover, overseas, bond, obligations, new, england, failed, to, provide, militia, units, or, financial, support, which, was, a, serious, blow, and, new, england, states, made, loud, threats, to, secede, as, evidenced, by, the, hartford, convention, britain, exploited, these, divisions, opting, to, not, blockade, the, ports, of, new, england, for, much, of, the, war, and, encouraging, smuggling, an, american, army, commanded, by, william, hull, invaded, upper, canada, on, july, 12, arriving, at, sandwich, windsor, ontario, after, crossing, the, detroit, river, hull, issued, a, proclamation, ordering, all, british, subjects, to, surrender, the, proclamation, said, that, hull, wanted, to, free, them, from, the, tyranny, of, great, britain, giving, them, the, liberty, security, and, wealth, that, his, own, country, enjoyed, unless, they, preferred, war, slavery, and, destruction, he, also, threatened, to, kill, any, british, soldier, caught, fighting, alongside, indigenous, fighters, hull, s, proclamation, only, helped, to, stiffen, resistance, to, the, american, attacks, as, he, lacked, artillery, and, supplies, hull, withdrew, to, the, american, side, of, the, river, on, 7, august, 1812, after, receiving, news, of, a, shawnee, ambush, on, major, thomas, van, horne, s, 200, men, who, had, been, sent, to, support, the, american, supply, convoy, hull, also, faced, a, lack, of, support, from, his, officers, and, fear, among, his, troops, of, a, possible, massacre, by, unfriendly, indigenous, forces, a, group, of, 600, troops, led, by, lieutenant, colonel, james, miller, remained, in, canada, attempting, to, supply, the, american, position, in, the, sandwich, area, with, little, success, major, general, isaac, brock, believed, that, he, should, take, bold, measures, to, calm, the, settler, population, in, canada, and, to, convince, the, tribes, that, britain, was, strong, he, moved, to, amherstburg, near, the, western, end, of, lake, erie, with, reinforcements, and, attacked, detroit, using, fort, malden, as, his, stronghold, hull, feared, that, the, british, possessed, superior, numbers, and, fort, detroit, lacked, adequate, gunpowder, and, cannonballs, to, withstand, a, long, siege, he, agreed, to, surrender, on, 16, august, hull, also, ordered, the, evacuation, of, fort, dearborn, chicago, to, fort, wayne, but, potawatomi, warriors, ambushed, them, and, escorted, them, back, to, the, fort, where, they, were, massacred, on, 15, august, the, fort, was, subsequently, burned, brock, moved, to, the, eastern, end, of, lake, erie, where, american, general, stephen, van, rensselaer, was, attempting, a, second, invasion, the, americans, attempted, an, attack, across, the, niagara, river, on, 13, october, but, they, were, defeated, at, queenston, heights, however, brock, was, killed, during, the, battle, and, british, leadership, suffered, after, his, death, american, general, henry, dearborn, made, a, final, attempt, to, advance, north, from, lake, champlain, but, his, militia, refused, to, go, beyond, american, territory, after, hull, surrendered, detroit, general, william, henry, harrison, took, command, of, the, american, army, of, the, northwest, he, set, out, to, retake, the, city, which, was, now, defended, by, colonel, henry, procter, and, tecumseh, a, detachment, of, harrison, s, army, was, defeated, at, frenchtown, along, the, river, raisin, on, 22, january, 1813, procter, left, the, prisoners, with, an, inadequate, guard, and, his, potawatomie, allies, killed, and, scalped, 60, captive, americans, the, defeat, ended, harrison, s, campaign, against, detroit, but, remember, the, river, raisin, became, a, rallying, cry, for, the, americans, in, may, 1813, procter, and, tecumseh, set, siege, to, fort, meigs, in, northwestern, ohio, tecumseh, s, fighters, ambushed, american, reinforcements, who, arrived, during, the, siege, but, the, fort, held, out, the, fighters, eventually, began, to, disperse, forcing, procter, and, tecumseh, to, return, to, canada, along, the, way, they, attempted, to, storm, fort, stephenson, a, small, american, post, on, the, sandusky, river, near, lake, erie, they, were, repulsed, with, serious, losses, marking, the, end, of, the, ohio, campaign, captain, oliver, hazard, perry, fought, the, battle, of, lake, erie, on, 10, september, 1813, his, decisive, victory, at, put, in, bay, ensured, american, military, control, of, the, lake, improved, american, morale, after, a, series, of, defeats, and, compelled, the, british, to, fall, back, from, detroit, this, enabled, general, harrison, to, launch, another, invasion, of, upper, canada, which, culminated, in, the, american, victory, at, the, battle, of, the, thames, on, 5, october, 1813, where, tecumseh, was, killed, the, mississippi, river, valley, was, the, western, frontier, of, the, united, states, in, 1812, the, territory, acquired, in, the, louisiana, purchase, of, 1803, contained, almost, no, american, settlements, west, of, the, mississippi, except, around, st, louis, and, a, few, forts, and, trading, posts, in, the, boonslick, fort, belle, fontaine, was, an, old, trading, post, converted, to, an, army, post, in, 1804, and, this, served, as, regional, headquarters, fort, osage, built, in, 1808, along, the, missouri, river, was, the, westernmost, american, outpost, but, it, was, abandoned, at, the, start, of, the, war, fort, madison, was, built, along, the, mississippi, in, iowa, in, 1808, and, had, been, repeatedly, attacked, by, british, allied, sauk, since, its, construction, the, united, states, army, abandoned, fort, madison, in, september, 1813, after, the, indigenous, fighters, attacked, it, and, besieged, it, with, support, from, the, british, this, was, one, of, the, few, battles, fought, west, of, the, mississippi, black, hawk, played, a, leadership, role, the, american, victory, on, lake, erie, and, the, recapture, of, detroit, isolated, the, british, on, lake, huron, in, the, winter, a, canadian, party, under, lieutenant, colonel, robert, mcdouall, established, a, new, supply, line, from, york, to, nottawasaga, bay, on, georgian, bay, he, arrived, at, fort, mackinac, on, 18, may, with, supplies, and, more, than, 400, militia, and, indians, then, sent, an, expedition, which, successfully, besieged, and, recaptured, the, key, trading, post, of, prairie, du, chien, on, the, upper, mississippi, the, americans, dispatched, a, substantial, expedition, to, relieve, the, fort, but, sauk, fox, and, kickapoo, warriors, under, black, hawk, ambushed, it, and, forced, it, to, withdraw, with, heavy, losses, in, the, battle, of, rock, island, rapids, in, september, 1814, the, sauk, fox, and, kickapoo, supported, by, part, of, prairie, du, chien, s, british, garrison, repulsed, a, second, american, force, led, by, major, zachary, taylor, in, the, battle, of, credit, island, these, victories, enabled, the, sauk, fox, and, kickapoo, to, harass, american, garrisons, further, to, the, south, which, led, the, americans, to, abandon, fort, johnson, in, central, illinois, territory, consequently, the, americans, lost, control, of, almost, all, of, illinois, territory, although, they, held, onto, the, st, louis, area, and, eastern, missouri, however, the, sauk, raided, even, into, these, territories, clashing, with, american, forces, at, the, battle, of, cote, sans, dessein, in, april, 1815, at, the, mouth, of, the, osage, river, in, the, missouri, territory, and, the, battle, of, the, sink, hole, in, may, 1815, near, fort, cap, au, gris, this, left, the, british, and, their, indian, allies, in, control, of, most, of, modern, illinois, and, all, of, modern, wisconsin, meanwhile, the, british, were, supplying, the, indians, in, the, old, northwest, from, montreal, via, mackinac, on, 3, july, the, americans, sent, a, force, of, five, vessels, from, detroit, to, recapture, mackinac, a, mixed, force, of, regulars, and, volunteers, from, the, militia, landed, on, the, island, on, 4, august, they, did, not, attempt, to, achieve, surprise, and, indians, ambushed, them, in, the, brief, battle, of, mackinac, island, and, forced, them, to, re, embark, the, americans, discovered, the, new, base, at, nottawasaga, bay, and, on, 13, august, they, destroyed, its, fortifications, and, the, schooner, nancy, that, they, found, there, they, then, returned, to, detroit, leaving, two, gunboats, to, blockade, mackinac, on, 4, september, the, british, surprised, boarded, and, captured, both, gunboats, these, engagements, on, lake, huron, left, mackinac, under, british, control, the, british, returned, mackinac, and, other, captured, territory, to, the, united, states, after, the, war, some, british, officers, and, canadians, objected, to, handing, back, prairie, du, chien, and, especially, mackinac, under, the, terms, of, the, treaty, of, ghent, however, the, americans, retained, the, captured, post, at, fort, malden, near, amherstburg, until, the, british, complied, with, the, treaty, fighting, between, americans, the, sauk, and, other, indigenous, tribes, continued, through, 1817, well, after, the, war, ended, in, the, east, both, sides, placed, great, importance, on, gaining, control, of, the, great, lakes, and, the, st, lawrence, river, because, of, the, difficulties, of, land, based, communication, the, british, already, had, a, small, squadron, of, warships, on, lake, ontario, when, the, war, began, and, had, the, initial, advantage, the, americans, established, a, navy, yard, at, sackett, s, harbor, new, york, a, port, on, lake, ontario, commodore, isaac, chauncey, took, charge, of, the, thousands, of, sailors, and, shipwrights, assigned, there, and, recruited, more, from, new, york, they, completed, a, warship, the, corvette, uss, madison, in, 45, days, ultimately, almost, 3, 000, men, at, the, shipyard, built, 11, warships, and, many, smaller, boats, and, transports, army, forces, were, also, stationed, at, sackett, s, harbor, where, they, camped, out, through, the, town, far, surpassing, the, small, population, of, 900, officers, were, housed, with, families, madison, barracks, was, later, built, at, sackett, s, harbor, having, regained, the, advantage, by, their, rapid, building, program, on, 27, april, 1813, chauncey, and, dearborn, attacked, york, the, capital, of, upper, canada, at, the, battle, of, york, the, outnumbered, british, regulars, destroyed, the, fort, and, dockyard, and, retreated, leaving, the, militia, to, surrender, the, town, american, soldiers, set, fire, to, the, legislature, building, and, looted, and, vandalized, several, government, buildings, and, citizens, homes, on, 25, may, 1813, fort, niagara, and, the, american, lake, ontario, squadron, began, bombarding, fort, george, an, american, amphibious, force, assaulted, fort, george, on, the, northern, end, of, the, niagara, river, on, 27, may, and, captured, it, without, serious, losses, the, british, abandoned, fort, erie, and, headed, towards, burlington, heights, the, british, position, was, close, to, collapsing, in, upper, canada, the, iroquois, considered, changing, sides, and, ignored, a, british, appeal, to, come, to, their, aid, however, the, americans, did, not, pursue, the, retreating, british, forces, until, they, had, largely, escaped, and, organized, a, counter, offensive, at, the, battle, of, stoney, creek, on, 5, june, the, british, launched, a, surprise, attack, at, 2, a, m, leading, to, confused, fighting, and, a, strategic, british, victory, the, americans, pulled, back, to, forty, mile, creek, rather, than, continue, their, advance, into, upper, canada, at, this, point, the, six, nations, of, the, grand, river, began, to, come, out, to, fight, for, the, british, as, an, american, victory, no, longer, seemed, inevitable, the, iroquois, ambushed, an, american, patrol, at, forty, mile, creek, while, the, royal, navy, squadron, based, in, kingston, sailed, in, and, bombarded, the, american, camp, general, dearborn, retreated, to, fort, george, mistakenly, believing, that, he, was, outnumbered, and, outgunned, british, brigadier, general, john, vincent, was, encouraged, when, about, 800, iroquois, arrived, to, assist, him, an, american, force, surrendered, on, 24, june, to, a, smaller, british, force, due, to, advance, warning, by, laura, secord, at, the, battle, of, beaver, dams, marking, the, end, of, the, american, offensive, into, upper, canada, british, major, general, francis, de, rottenburg, did, not, have, the, strength, to, retake, fort, george, so, he, instituted, a, blockade, hoping, to, starve, the, americans, into, surrender, meanwhile, commodore, james, lucas, yeo, had, taken, charge, of, the, british, ships, on, the, lake, and, mounted, a, counterattack, which, the, americans, repulsed, at, the, battle, of, sackett, s, harbor, thereafter, chauncey, and, yeo, s, squadrons, fought, two, indecisive, actions, off, the, niagara, on, 7, august, and, at, burlington, bay, on, 28, september, neither, commander, was, prepared, to, take, major, risks, to, gain, a, complete, victory, late, in, 1813, the, americans, abandoned, the, canadian, territory, that, they, occupied, around, fort, george, they, set, fire, to, the, village, of, newark, now, niagara, on, the, lake, on, 10, december, 1813, incensing, the, canadians, many, of, the, inhabitants, were, left, without, shelter, freezing, to, death, in, the, snow, the, british, retaliated, following, their, capture, of, fort, niagara, on, 18, december, 1813, a, british, indian, force, led, by, riall, stormed, the, neighbouring, town, of, lewiston, new, york, on, 19, december, four, american, civilians, were, killed, by, drunken, indians, after, the, battle, a, small, force, of, tuscarora, warriors, engaged, riall, s, men, during, the, battle, which, allowed, many, residents, of, lewiston, to, evacuate, the, village, the, british, and, their, indian, allies, subsequently, attacked, and, burned, buffalo, on, lake, erie, on, 30, december, 1813, in, revenge, for, the, american, attack, on, fort, george, and, newark, in, may, the, british, were, vulnerable, along, the, stretch, of, the, st, lawrence, that, was, between, upper, canada, and, the, united, states, in, the, winter, of, 1812, 1813, the, americans, launched, a, series, of, raids, from, ogdensburg, new, york, that, hampered, british, supply, traffic, up, the, river, on, 21, february, george, pr, vost, passed, through, prescott, ontario, on, the, opposite, bank, of, the, river, with, reinforcements, for, upper, canada, when, he, left, the, next, day, the, reinforcements, and, local, militia, attacked, in, the, battle, of, ogdensburg, and, the, americans, were, forced, to, retreat, the, americans, made, two, more, thrusts, against, montreal, in, 1813, major, general, wade, hampton, was, to, march, north, from, lake, champlain, and, join, a, force, under, general, james, wilkinson, that, would, sail, from, sackett, s, harbor, on, lake, ontario, and, descend, the, st, lawrence, hampton, was, delayed, by, road, and, supply, problems, and, his, intense, dislike, of, wilkinson, limited, his, desire, to, support, his, plan, charles, de, salaberry, defeated, hampton, s, force, of, 4, 000, at, the, chateauguay, river, on, 25, october, with, a, smaller, force, of, canadian, voltigeurs, and, mohawks, salaberry, s, force, numbered, only, 339, but, it, had, a, strong, defensive, position, wilkinson, s, force, of, 8, 000, set, out, on, 17, october, but, it, was, delayed, by, weather, wilkinson, heard, that, a, british, force, was, pursuing, him, under, captain, william, mulcaster, and, lieutenant, colonel, joseph, wanton, morrison, and, landed, near, morrisburg, ontario, by, 10, november, about, 150, kilometres, 90, mi, from, montreal, on, 11, november, his, rear, guard, of, 2, 500, attacked, morrison, s, force, of, 800, at, crysler, s, farm, and, was, repulsed, with, heavy, losses, he, learned, that, hampton, could, not, renew, his, advance, retreated, to, the, united, states, and, settled, into, winter, quarters, he, resigned, his, command, after, a, failed, attack, on, a, british, outpost, at, lacolle, mills, the, americans, again, invaded, the, niagara, frontier, they, had, occupied, southwestern, upper, canada, after, they, defeated, colonel, henry, procter, at, moraviantown, in, october, and, believed, that, taking, the, rest, of, the, province, would, force, the, british, to, cede, it, to, them, the, end, of, the, war, with, napoleon, in, europe, in, april, 1814, meant, that, the, british, could, deploy, their, army, to, north, america, so, the, americans, wanted, to, secure, upper, canada, to, negotiate, from, a, position, of, strength, they, planned, to, invade, via, the, niagara, frontier, while, sending, another, force, to, recapture, mackinac, they, captured, fort, erie, on, 3, july, 1814, unaware, of, fort, erie, s, fall, or, of, the, size, of, the, american, force, the, british, general, phineas, riall, engaged, with, winfield, scott, who, won, against, a, british, force, at, the, battle, of, chippawa, on, 5, july, the, american, forces, had, been, through, a, hard, training, under, winfield, scott, and, proved, to, the, professionals, under, fire, they, would, deploy, in, a, shallow, u, formation, bringing, flanking, fire, and, well, aimed, volleys, against, riall, s, men, riall, s, men, were, chased, off, the, battlefield, an, attempt, to, advance, further, ended, with, the, hard, fought, but, inconclusive, battle, of, lundy, s, lane, on, july, 25, the, battle, was, fought, several, miles, north, of, chippewa, river, near, niagara, falls, and, is, considered, the, bloodiest, and, costliest, battle, of, the, war, both, sides, stood, their, ground, as, american, general, jacob, brown, pulled, back, to, fort, george, after, the, battle, and, the, british, did, not, pursue, commanders, riall, scott, brown, and, drummond, were, all, wounded, scott, s, wounds, ended, his, commission, for, the, rest, of, the, war, the, americans, withdrew, but, withstood, a, prolonged, siege, of, fort, erie, the, british, tried, to, storm, fort, erie, on, 14, august, 1814, but, they, suffered, heavy, losses, losing, 950, killed, wounded, and, captured, compared, to, only, 84, dead, and, wounded, on, the, american, side, the, british, were, further, weakened, by, exposure, and, shortage, of, supplies, eventually, they, raised, the, siege, but, american, major, general, george, izard, took, over, command, on, the, niagara, front, and, followed, up, only, halfheartedly, an, american, raid, along, the, grand, river, destroyed, many, farms, and, weakened, british, logistics, in, october, 1814, the, americans, advanced, into, upper, canada, and, engaged, in, skirmishes, at, cook, s, mill, but, they, pulled, back, when, they, heard, that, the, new, british, warship, hms, st, lawrence, launched, in, kingston, that, september, was, on, its, way, armed, with, 104, guns, the, americans, lacked, provisions, and, retreated, across, the, niagara, after, destroying, fort, erie, meanwhile, 15, 000, british, troops, were, sent, to, north, america, under, four, of, wellington, s, ablest, brigade, commanders, after, napoleon, abdicated, fewer, than, half, were, veterans, of, the, peninsula, and, the, rest, came, from, garrisons, pr, vost, was, ordered, to, neutralize, american, power, on, the, lakes, by, burning, sackett, s, harbor, to, gain, naval, control, of, lake, erie, lake, ontario, and, the, upper, lakes, as, well, as, to, defend, lower, canada, from, attack, he, did, defend, lower, canada, but, otherwise, failed, to, achieve, his, objectives, so, he, decided, to, invade, new, york, state, his, army, outnumbered, the, american, defenders, of, plattsburgh, but, he, was, worried, about, his, flanks, and, decided, that, he, needed, naval, control, of, lake, champlain, upon, reaching, plattsburgh, pr, vost, delayed, the, assault, until, downie, arrived, in, the, hastily, completed, 36, gun, frigate, hms, confiance, despite, the, confiance, not, being, fully, completed, she, had, a, raw, crew, that, had, never, worked, together, pr, vost, forced, downie, into, a, premature, attack, when, there, was, no, reason, for, the, rush, the, british, squadron, on, the, lake, under, captain, george, downie, was, more, evenly, matched, by, the, americans, under, master, commandant, thomas, macdonough, at, the, battle, of, plattsburgh, on, 11, september, 1814, the, british, had, the, advantage, of, larger, vessels, and, guns, the, american, gunboats, were, more, suited, to, engagements, on, lake, champlain, while, macdonough, was, able, to, manoeuvre, his, ships, using, pulley, lines, attached, to, anchors, early, in, the, battle, each, side, lost, a, ship, downie, was, killed, by, the, recoil, of, a, loose, gun, carriage, while, macdonough, was, twice, knocked, down, and, dazed, after, two, and, a, half, hours, hms, confiance, suffered, heavy, casualties, and, struck, her, colours, and, the, rest, of, the, british, fleet, retreated, prevost, already, alienated, from, his, veteran, officers, by, insisting, on, proper, dress, codes, now, lost, their, confidence, while, macdonough, emerged, as, a, national, hero, the, americans, now, had, control, of, lake, champlain, theodore, roosevelt, later, termed, it, the, greatest, naval, battle, of, the, war, general, alexander, macomb, led, the, successful, land, defence, pr, vost, then, turned, back, to, the, astonishment, of, his, senior, officers, saying, that, it, was, too, hazardous, to, remain, on, enemy, territory, after, the, loss, of, naval, supremacy, he, was, recalled, to, london, where, a, naval, court, martial, decided, that, defeat, had, been, caused, principally, by, pr, vost, urging, the, squadron, into, premature, action, and, then, failing, to, afford, the, promised, support, from, the, land, forces, he, died, suddenly, just, before, his, court, martial, was, to, convene, his, reputation, sank, to, a, new, low, as, canadians, claimed, that, their, militia, under, brock, did, the, job, but, pr, vost, failed, however, recent, historians, have, been, kinder, peter, burroughs, argues, that, his, preparations, were, energetic, well, conceived, and, comprehensive, for, defending, the, canadas, with, limited, means, and, that, he, achieved, the, primary, objective, of, preventing, an, american, conquest, maine, then, part, of, massachusetts, was, a, base, for, smuggling, and, illegal, trade, between, the, united, states, and, the, british, until, 1813, the, region, was, generally, quiet, except, for, privateer, actions,

renamed, the, captured, fort, fort, sherbrooke, in, september, 1814, john, coape, sherbrooke, led, 3, 000, british, troops, from, his, base, in, halifax, in, the, penobscot, expedition, in, 26, days, he, raided, and, looted, hampden, bangor, and, machias, destroying, or, capturing, 17, american, ships, he, won, the, battle, of, hampden, with, two, killed, while, the, americans, had, one, killed, retreating, american, forces, were, forced, to, destroy, the, frigate, adams, the, british, occupied, the, town, of, castine, and, most, of, eastern, maine, for, the, rest, of, the, war, governing, it, under, martial, law, and, re, establishing, the, colony, of, new, ireland, the, treaty, of, ghent, returned, this, territory, to, the, united, states, when, the, british, left, in, april, 1815, they, took, 10, 750, in, tariff, duties, from, castine, this, money, called, the, castine, fund, was, used, to, establish, dalhousie, university, in, halifax, decisions, about, the, islands, in, passamaquoddy, bay, were, decided, by, joint, commission, in, 1817, however, machias, seal, island, had, been, seized, by, the, british, as, part, of, the, occupation, and, was, unaddressed, by, the, commission, while, kept, by, britain, canada, it, remains, in, dispute, to, this, day, the, strategic, location, of, the, chesapeake, bay, near, the, potomac, river, made, it, a, prime, target, for, the, british, rear, admiral, george, cockburn, arrived, there, in, march, 1813, and, was, joined, by, admiral, warren, who, took, command, of, operations, ten, days, later, starting, in, march, a, squadron, under, cockburn, started, a, blockade, of, the, mouth, of, the, bay, at, hampton, roads, harbour, and, raided, towns, along, the, bay, from, norfolk, virginia, to, havre, de, grace, maryland, in, late, april, cockburn, landed, at, and, set, fire, to, frenchtown, maryland, and, destroyed, ships, that, were, docked, there, in, the, following, weeks, he, routed, the, local, militias, and, looted, and, burned, three, other, towns, thereafter, he, marched, to, iron, foundry, at, principio, and, destroyed, it, along, with, sixty, eight, cannons, on, 4, july, 1813, commodore, joshua, barney, an, american, revolutionary, war, naval, officer, convinced, the, navy, department, to, build, the, chesapeake, bay, flotilla, a, squadron, of, twenty, barges, powered, by, small, sails, or, oars, sweeps, to, defend, the, chesapeake, bay, launched, in, april, 1814, the, squadron, was, quickly, cornered, on, the, patuxent, river, while, successful, in, harassing, the, royal, navy, they, could, not, stop, subsequent, british, operations, in, the, area, in, august, 1814, a, force, of, 2, 500, soldiers, under, general, ross, had, just, arrived, in, bermuda, aboard, hms, royal, oak, three, frigates, three, sloops, and, ten, other, vessels, released, from, the, peninsular, war, by, victory, the, british, intended, to, use, them, for, diversionary, raids, along, the, coasts, of, maryland, and, virginia, in, response, to, pr, vost, s, request, they, decided, to, employ, this, force, together, with, the, naval, and, military, units, already, on, the, station, to, strike, at, the, national, capital, anticipating, the, attack, valuable, documents, including, the, original, constitution, were, removed, to, leesburg, virginia, the, british, task, force, advanced, up, the, chesapeake, routing, commodore, barney, s, flotilla, of, gunboats, carried, out, the, raid, on, alexandria, landed, ground, forces, that, bested, the, us, defenders, at, the, battle, of, bladensburg, and, carried, out, the, burning, of, washington, united, states, secretary, of, war, john, armstrong, jr, insisted, that, the, british, were, going, to, attack, baltimore, rather, than, washington, even, as, british, army, and, naval, units, were, on, their, way, to, washington, brigadier, general, william, h, winder, who, had, burned, several, bridges, in, the, area, assumed, the, british, would, attack, annapolis, and, was, reluctant, to, engage, because, he, mistakenly, thought, the, british, army, was, twice, its, size, the, inexperienced, state, militia, was, easily, routed, in, the, battle, of, bladensburg, opening, the, route, to, washington, british, troops, led, by, major, general, robert, ross, accompanied, by, cockburn, the, 3rd, brigade, attacked, and, captured, washington, with, a, force, of, 4, 500, on, 24, august, after, the, british, had, finished, looting, the, interiors, ross, directed, his, troops, to, set, fire, to, number, of, public, buildings, including, the, white, house, and, the, united, states, capitol, extensive, damage, to, the, interiors, and, the, contents, of, both, were, subsequently, reported, us, government, and, military, officials, fled, to, virginia, while, secretary, of, the, united, states, navy, william, jones, ordered, the, washington, navy, yard, and, a, nearby, fort, to, be, razed, in, order, to, prevent, its, capture, public, buildings, in, washington, were, destroyed, by, the, british, though, private, residences, ordered, spared, after, taking, some, munitions, from, the, washington, munitions, depot, the, british, boarded, their, ships, and, moved, on, to, their, major, target, the, heavily, fortified, major, city, of, baltimore, because, some, of, their, ships, were, held, up, in, the, raid, on, alexandria, they, delayed, their, movement, allowing, baltimore, an, opportunity, to, strengthen, the, fortifications, and, bring, in, new, federal, troops, and, state, militia, units, the, battle, for, baltimore, began, with, the, british, landing, on, 12, september, 1814, at, north, point, where, they, were, met, by, american, militia, further, up, the, patapsco, neck, peninsula, an, exchange, of, fire, began, with, casualties, on, both, sides, the, british, army, commander, major, gen, robert, ross, was, killed, by, snipers, the, british, paused, then, continued, to, march, northwestward, to, face, the, stationed, maryland, and, baltimore, city, militia, units, at, godly, wood, the, battle, of, north, point, was, fought, for, several, afternoon, hours, in, a, musketry, and, artillery, duel, the, british, also, planned, to, simultaneously, attack, baltimore, by, water, on, the, following, day, although, the, royal, navy, was, unable, to, reduce, fort, mchenry, at, the, entrance, to, baltimore, harbor, in, support, of, an, attack, from, the, northeast, by, the, british, army, the, british, eventually, realized, that, they, could, not, force, the, passage, to, attack, baltimore, in, coordination, with, the, land, force, a, last, ditch, night, feint, and, barge, attack, during, a, heavy, rain, storm, was, led, by, captain, charles, napier, around, the, fort, up, the, middle, branch, of, the, river, to, the, west, split, and, misdirected, partly, in, the, storm, it, turned, back, after, suffering, heavy, casualties, from, the, alert, gunners, of, fort, covington, and, battery, babcock, the, british, called, off, the, attack, and, sailed, downriver, to, pick, up, their, army, which, had, retreated, from, the, east, side, of, baltimore, all, the, lights, were, extinguished, in, baltimore, the, night, of, the, attack, and, the, fort, was, bombarded, for, 25, hours, the, only, light, was, given, off, by, the, exploding, shells, over, fort, mchenry, illuminating, the, flag, that, was, still, flying, over, the, fort, the, defence, of, the, fort, inspired, the, american, lawyer, francis, scott, key, to, write, defence, of, fort, m, henry, a, poem, that, was, later, set, to, music, as, the, star, spangled, banner, because, of, the, region, s, polyglot, population, both, the, british, and, the, americans, perceived, the, war, in, the, gulf, south, as, a, fundamentally, different, conflict, from, the, one, occurring, in, the, lowcountry, and, chesapeake, before, 1813, the, war, between, the, creeks, or, muscogee, had, been, largely, an, internal, affair, sparked, by, the, ideas, of, tecumseh, farther, north, in, the, mississippi, valley, a, faction, known, as, the, red, sticks, so, named, for, the, colour, of, their, war, sticks, had, broken, away, from, the, rest, of, the, creek, confederacy, which, wanted, peace, with, the, united, states, the, red, sticks, were, allied, with, tecumseh, who, had, visited, the, creeks, about, a, year, before, 1813, and, encouraged, greater, resistance, to, the, americans, the, creek, nation, was, a, trading, partner, of, the, united, states, actively, involved, with, british, and, spanish, trade, as, well, the, red, sticks, as, well, as, many, southern, muscogee, people, like, the, seminole, had, a, long, history, of, alliance, with, the, british, and, spanish, empires, this, alliance, helped, the, north, american, and, european, powers, protect, each, other, s, claims, to, territory, in, the, south, on, 27, july, the, red, sticks, were, returning, from, pensacola, with, a, pack, train, filled, with, trade, goods, and, arms, when, they, were, attacked, by, americans, who, made, off, with, their, goods, on, 30, august, 1813, in, retaliation, for, the,

florida, the, attack, on, fort, mims, resulted, in, the, horrific, death, of, 400, refugee, settlers, all, butchered, and, scalped, including, women, and, children, and, became, an, ideological, rallying, point, for, the, americans, it, prompted, the, state, of, georgia, and, the, mississippi, militia, to, immediately, take, major, action, against, creek, offensives, the, red, sticks, chiefs, gained, power, in, the, east, along, the, alabama, river, coosa, river, and, tallapoosa, river, in, the, upper, creek, territory, by, contrast, the, lower, creek, who, lived, along, the, chattahoochee, river, generally, opposed, the, red, sticks, and, wanted, to, remain, allied, to, the, u, s, indian, agent, benjamin, hawkins, recruited, lower, creek, to, aid, the, 6th, military, district, under, general, thomas, pinckney, and, the, state, militias, against, the, red, sticks, the, united, states, combined, forces, were, 5, 000, troops, from, east, and, west, tennessee, with, about, 200, indigenous, allies, at, its, peak, the, red, stick, faction, had, 4, 000, warriors, only, a, quarter, of, whom, had, muskets, the, indian, frontier, of, western, georgia, was, the, most, vulnerable, but, was, partially, fortified, already, from, november, 1813, to, january, 1814, georgia, s, militia, and, auxiliary, federal, troops, from, the, creek, and, cherokee, indigenous, nations, and, the, states, of, north, carolina, and, south, carolina, organized, the, fortification, of, defences, along, the, chattahoochee, river, and, expeditions, into, upper, creek, territory, in, present, day, alabama, the, army, led, by, general, john, floyd, went, to, the, heart, of, the, creek, holy, grounds, and, won, a, major, offensive, against, one, of, the, largest, creek, towns, at, the, battle, of, autossee, killing, an, estimated, two, hundred, people, in, november, the, militia, of, mississippi, with, a, combined, 1, 200, troops, attacked, the, econachca, encampment, in, the, battle, of, holy, ground, on, the, alabama, river, tennessee, raised, a, militia, of, 5, 000, under, major, general, andrew, jackson, and, brigadier, general, john, coffee, and, won, the, battles, of, tallushatchee, and, talladega, in, november, 1813, jackson, suffered, enlistment, problems, in, the, winter, he, decided, to, combine, his, force, composed, of, tennessee, militia, and, pro, american, creek, with, the, georgia, militia, in, january, however, the, red, sticks, attacked, his, army, at, the, battles, of, emuckfaw, and, enotachopo, creek, jackson, s, troops, repelled, the, attackers, but, they, were, outnumbered, and, forced, to, withdraw, to, his, base, at, fort, strother, in, january, floyd, s, force, of, 1, 300, state, militia, and, 400, creek, moved, to, join, the, united, states, forces, in, tennessee, but, they, were, attacked, in, camp, on, the, calibee, creek, by, tukabatchee, muscogees, on, 27, january, jackson, s, force, increased, in, numbers, with, the, arrival, of, united, states, army, soldiers, and, a, second, draft, of, tennessee, state, militia, cherokee, and, pro, american, creek, swelled, his, army, to, around, 5, 000, in, march, 1814, they, moved, south, to, attack, the, red, sticks, on, 27, march, jackson, decisively, defeated, a, force, of, about, a, thousand, red, sticks, at, horseshoe, bend, killing, 800, of, them, at, a, cost, of, 49, killed, and, 154, wounded, jackson, then, moved, his, army, to, fort, jackson, on, the, alabama, river, he, promptly, turned, on, the, pro, american, creek, who, had, fought, with, him, and, compelled, their, chieftains, along, with, a, single, red, stick, chieftain, to, sign, the, treaty, of, fort, jackson, which, forced, the, creek, tribe, as, a, whole, to, cede, most, of, western, georgia, and, part, of, alabama, to, the, u, s, both, hawkins, and, the, pro, american, creek, strongly, opposed, the, treaty, which, they, regarded, as, deeply, unjust, the, third, clause, of, the, treaty, also, demanded, that, the, creek, cease, communicating, with, the, british, and, spanish, and, trade, only, with, united, states, approved, agents, british, aid, to, the, red, sticks, arrived, after, the, end, of, the, napoleonic, wars, in, april, 1814, and, after, admiral, alexander, cochrane, assumed, command, from, admiral, warren, in, march, captain, hugh, pigot, arrived, in, may, 1814, with, two, ships, to, arm, the, red, sticks, he, thought, that, some, 6, 600, warriors, could, be, armed, and, recruited, it, was, overly, optimistic, at, best, the, red, sticks, were, in, the, process, of, being, destroyed, as, a, military, force, in, april, 1814, the, british, established, an, outpost, on, the, apalachicola, river, prospect, bluff, historic, sites, cochrane, sent, a, company, of, royal, marines, commanded, by, edward, nicolls, the, vessels, hms, hermes, and, hms, carron, and, further, supplies, to, meet, the, indians, in, the, region, in, addition, to, training, them, nicolls, was, tasked, to, raise, a, force, from, escaped, slaves, as, part, of, the, corps, of, colonial, marines, on, 12, july, 1814, general, jackson, complained, to, the, governor, of, western, florida, mateo, gonz, lez, manrique, situated, at, pensacola, that, combatants, from, the, creek, war, were, being, harboured, in, spanish, territory, and, made, reference, to, reports, of, the, british, presence, on, spanish, soil, although, he, gave, an, angry, reply, to, jackson, manrique, was, alarmed, at, the, weak, position, he, found, himself, in, and, appealed, to, the, british, for, help, the, british, were, observed, docking, on, august, 25, and, unloading, the, following, day, the, first, engagement, of, the, british, and, their, creek, allies, against, the, americans, on, the, gulf, coast, was, the, 14, september, 1814, attack, on, fort, bowyer, captain, william, percy, tried, to, take, the, united, states, fort, hoping, to, then, move, on, mobile, and, block, united, states, trade, and, encroachment, on, the, mississippi, after, the, americans, repulsed, percy, s, forces, the, british, established, a, military, presence, of, up, to, 200, marines, at, pensacola, in, november, jackson, s, force, of, 4, 000, men, took, the, town, this, underlined, the, superiority, of, numbers, of, jackson, s, force, in, the, region, the, united, states, force, moved, to, new, orleans, in, late, 1814, jackson, s, army, of, 1, 000, regulars, and, 3, 000, to, 4, 000, militia, pirates, and, other, fighters, as, well, as, civilians, and, slaves, built, fortifications, south, of, the, city, american, forces, under, general, james, wilkinson, himself, a, paid, spanish, secret, agent, took, the, mobile, area, from, the, spanish, in, march, 1813, this, region, was, the, rump, of, spanish, west, florida, the, western, portion, of, which, had, been, annexed, to, the, united, states, in, 1810, the, americans, built, fort, bowyer, a, log, and, earthen, work, fort, with, 14, guns, on, mobile, point, to, defend, it, major, latour, opined, that, none, of, the, three, forts, in, the, area, were, capable, of, resisting, a, siege, at, the, end, of, 1814, the, british, launched, a, double, offensive, in, the, south, weeks, before, the, treaty, of, ghent, was, signed, on, the, atlantic, coast, admiral, george, cockburn, was, to, close, the, intracoastal, waterway, trade, and, land, royal, marine, battalions, to, advance, through, georgia, to, the, western, territories, while, on, the, gulf, coast, admiral, alexander, cochrane, moved, on, the, new, state, of, louisiana, and, the, mississippi, territory, cochrane, s, ships, reached, the, louisiana, coast, on, 9, december, and, cockburn, arrived, in, georgia, on, 14, december, the, british, army, had, the, objective, of, gaining, control, of, the, entrance, of, the, mississippi, to, this, end, an, expeditionary, force, of, 8, 000, troops, under, general, edward, pakenham, attacked, jackson, s, prepared, defences, in, new, orleans, on, 8, january, 1815, the, battle, of, new, orleans, was, an, american, victory, as, the, british, failed, to, take, the, fortifications, on, the, east, bank, the, british, attack, force, suffered, high, casualties, including, 291, dead, 1, 262, wounded, and, 484, captured, or, missing, whereas, american, casualties, were, light, with, 13, dead, 39, wounded, and, 19, missing, according, to, the, respective, official, casualty, returns, this, battle, was, hailed, as, a, great, victory, across, the, united, states, making, jackson, a, national, hero, and, eventually, propelling, him, to, the, presidency, in, january, 1815, fort, st, philip, endured, ten, days, of, bombardment, from, two, bomb, vessels, of, the, royal, navy, robert, v, remini, believes, this, was, preventing, the, british, moving, their, fleet, up, the, mississippi, in, support, of, the, land, attack, after, deciding, further, attacks, would, be, too, costly, and, unlikely, to, succeed, the, british, troops, withdrew, on, 18, january, however, adverse, winds, slowed, the, evacuation, operation, and, it, was, not, until, 27, january, 1815, that, the, land, forces, rejoined, the, fleet, allowing, for, its, final, departure, after, new, orleans, the, british, moved, to, take, mobile, as, a, base, for, further, operations, in, preparation, general, john, lambert, laid, siege, to, fort, bowyer, taking, it, on, 12, february, 1815, however, hms, brazen, brought, news, of, the, treaty, of, ghent, the, next, day, and, the, british, abandoned, the, gulf, coast, this, ending, of, the, war, prevented, the, capture, of, mobile, and, any, renewed, attacks, on, new, orleans, meanwhile, in, january, 1815, cockburn, succeeded, in, blockading, the, southeastern, coast, of, georgia, by, occupying, camden, county, the, british, quickly, took, cumberland, island, fort, point, peter, and, fort, st, tammany, in, a, decisive, victory, under, the, orders, of, his, commanding, officers, cockburn, s, forces, relocated, many, refugee, slaves, capturing, st, simons, island, as, well, to, do, so, he, had, orders, to, recruit, as, many, runaway, slaves, into, the, corps, of, colonial, marines, as, possible, and, use, them, to, conduct, raids, in, georgia, and, the, carolinas, cockburn, also, provided, thousands, of, muskets, and, carbines, and, a, huge, quantity, of, ammunition, to, the, creeks, and, seminole, indians, for, the, same, purpose, during, the, invasion, of, the, georgia, coast, an, estimated, 1, 485, people, chose, to, relocate, to, british, territories, or, join, the, british, military, however, by, mid, march, several, days, after, being, informed, of, the, treaty, of, ghent, british, ships, left, the, area, the, british, government, did, not, recognize, either, west, florida, or, new, orleans, as, american, territory, the, historian, frank, owsley, suggests, that, they, might, have, used, a, victory, at, new, orleans, to, demand, further, concessions, from, the, u, s, however, subsequent, research, in, the, correspondence, of, british, ministers, at, the, time, suggests, otherwise, with, specific, reference, to, correspondence, from, the, prime, minister, to, the, foreign, secretary, dated, 23, december, 1814, west, florida, was, the, only, territory, permanently, gained, by, the, united, states, during, the, war, in, 1812, britain, s, royal, navy, was, the, world, s, largest, and, most, powerful, navy, with, over, 600, vessels, in, commission, following, the, defeat, of, the, french, navy, at, the, battle, of, trafalgar, in, 1805, most, of, these, ships, were, employed, blockading, the, french, navy, and, protecting, british, trade, against, french, privateers, but, the, royal, navy, still, had, 85, vessels, in, american, waters, counting, all, north, american, and, caribbean, waters, however, the, royal, navy, s, north, american, squadron, was, the, most, immediately, available, force, based, in, halifax, and, bermuda, two, of, the, colonies, that, made, up, british, north, america, and, numbered, one, small, ship, of, the, line, and, seven, frigates, as, well, as, nine, smaller, sloops, and, brigs, and, five, schooners, by, contrast, the, entire, united, states, navy, was, composed, of, 8, frigates, 14, smaller, sloops, and, brigs, with, no, ships, of, the, line, the, united, states, had, embarked, on, a, major, shipbuilding, program, before, the, war, at, sackett, s, harbor, to, provide, ships, for, use, on, the, great, lakes, and, continued, to, produce, new, ships, the, british, strategy, was, to, protect, their, own, merchant, shipping, between, halifax, and, the, west, indies, with, the, order, given, on, 13, october, 1812, to, enforce, a, blockade, of, major, american, ports, to, restrict, american, trade, because, of, their, numerical, inferiority, the, american, strategy, was, to, cause, disruption, through, hit, and, run, tactics, such, as, the, capturing, prizes, and, engaging, royal, navy, vessels, only, under, favourable, circumstances, days, after, the, formal, declaration, of, war, the, united, states, put, out, two, small, squadrons, including, the, frigate, president, and, the, sloop, hornet, under, commodore, john, rodgers, and, the, frigates, united, states, and, congress, with, the, brig, argus, under, captain, stephen, decatur, these, were, initially, concentrated, as, one, unit, under, rodgers, who, intended, to, force, the, royal, navy, to, concentrate, its, own, ships, to, prevent, isolated, units, being, captured, by, his, powerful, force, large, numbers, of, american, merchant, ships, were, returning, to, the, united, states, with, the, outbreak, of, war, and, the, royal, navy, could, not, watch, all, the, ports, on, the, american, seaboard, if, they, were, concentrated, together, rodgers, strategy, worked, in, that, the, royal, navy, concentrated, most, of, its, frigates, off, new, york, harbor, under, captain, philip, broke, allowing, many, american, ships, to, reach, home, however, rodgers, own, cruise, captured, only, five, small, merchant, ships, and, the, americans, never, subsequently, concentrated, more, than, two, or, three, ships, together, as, a, unit, the, more, recently, built, frigates, of, the, us, navy, were, intended, to, overmatch, their, opponents, the, united, states, did, not, believe, that, it, could, build, a, large, enough, navy, to, contest, with, the, royal, navy, in, fleet, actions, therefore, where, it, could, be, done, individual, ships, were, built, to, be, tougher, larger, and, carry, more, firepower, than, their, equivalents, in, european, navies, the, newest, three, 44, gun, ships, were, designed, with, a, 24, pounder, main, battery, these, frigates, were, intended, to, demolish, the, 36, to, 38, gun, 18, pounder, armed, frigates, that, formed, the, majority, of, the, world, s, navies, while, being, able, to, evade, larger, ships, similarly, the, wasp, class, ship, sloops, were, an, over, match, to, the, cruizer, class, brigs, being, employed, by, the, british, the, royal, navy, maintaining, more, than, 600, ships, in, fleets, and, stations, worldwide, was, overstretched, and, undermanned, most, british, ships, enforcing, the, blockade, were, with, a, few, notable, exceptions, less, practiced, than, the, crews, of, the, smaller, us, navy, this, meant, that, in, single, ship, actions, the, royal, navy, ships, often, found, themselves, against, larger, ships, with, larger, crews, who, were, better, drilled, as, intended, by, the, us, planners, however, naval, ships, do, not, fight, as, individuals, by, the, code, of, the, duel, they, are, national, instruments, of, war, and, are, used, as, such, the, royal, navy, counted, on, its, numbers, experience, and, traditions, to, overcome, the, individually, superior, vessels, as, the, us, navy, found, itself, mostly, blockaded, by, the, end, of, the, war, the, royal, navy, was, correct, for, all, the, fame, that, these, actions, received, they, in, no, way, affected, the, outcome, of, the, results, of, atlantic, theatre, of, war, the, final, count, of, frigates, lost, was, three, on, each, side, with, most, of, the, us, navy, blockaded, in, port, during, the, war, the, united, states, navy, captured, 165, british, merchantmen, although, privateers, captured, many, more, while, the, royal, navy, captured, 1, 400, american, merchantmen, more, significantly, the, british, blockade, of, the, atlantic, coast, caused, the, majority, of, warships, to, be, unable, to, put, to, sea, and, shut, down, both, american, imports, and, exports, notable, single, ship, engagements, include, uss, constitution, vs, hms, guerriere, on, 19, august, 1812, uss, united, states, vs, hms, macedonian, on, 25, october, uss, constitution, vs, hms, java, on, 29, 30, december, hms, shannon, vs, uss, chesapeake, on, 1, june, 1813, the, bloodiest, such, action, of, the, war, hms, phoebe, vs, uss, essex, on, 28, march, 1814, hms, endymion, vs, uss, president, on, 15, january, 1815, in, single, ship, battles, superior, force, was, the, most, significant, factor, in, response, to, the, majority, of, the, american, ships, being, of, greater, force, than, the, british, ships, of, the, same, class, britain, constructed, five, 40, gun, 24, pounder, heavy, frigates, and, two, spar, decked, frigates, the, 60, gun, hms, leander, and, hms, newcastle, and, others, to, counter, the, american, sloops, of, war, the, british, constructed, the, cyrus, class, ship, sloop, of, 22, guns, the, british, admiralty, also, instituted, a, new, policy, that, the, three, american, heavy, frigates, should, not, be, engaged, except, by, a, ship, of, the, line, or, frigates, in, squadron, strength, the, united, states, navy, s, smaller, ship, sloops, had, also, won, several, victories, over, royal, navy, sloops, of, war, again, of, smaller, armament, the, american, sloops, hornet, wasp, 1807, peacock, wasp, 1813, and, frolic, were, all, ship, rigged, while, the, british, cruizer, class, sloops, that, they, encountered, were, brig, rigged, which, gave, the, americans, a, significant, advantage, ship, rigged, vessels, are, more, manoeuvrable, in, battle, because, they, have, a, wider, variety, of, sails, and, thus, being, more, resistant, to, damage, ship, rigged, vessels, can, back, sail, literally, backing, up, or, heave, to, stop, the, operations, of, american, privateers, proved, a, more, significant, threat, to, british, trade, than, the, united, states, navy, they, operated, throughout, the, atlantic, until, the, close, of, the, war, most, notably, from, baltimore, american, privateers, reported, taking, 1300, british, merchant, vessels, compared, to, 254, taken, by, the, united, states, navy, although, the, insurer, lloyd, s, of, london, reported, that, only, 1, 175, british, ships, were, taken, 373, of, which, were, recaptured, for, a, total, loss, of, 802, canadian, historian, carl, benn, wrote, that, american, privateers, took, 1, 344, british, ships, of, which, 750, were, retaken, by, the, british, the, british, tried, to, limit, privateering, losses, by, the, strict, enforcement, of, convoy, by, the, royal, navy, and, directly, by, capturing, 278, american, privateers, due, to, the, massive, size, of, the, british, merchant, fleet, american, captures, only, affected, 7, 5, of, the, fleet, resulting, in, no, supply, shortages, or, lack, of, reinforcements, for, british, forces, in, north, america, of, 526, american, privateers, 148, were, captured, by, the, royal, navy, and, only, 207, ever, took, a, prize, due, to, the, large, size, of, their, navy, the, british, did, not, rely, as, much, on, privateering, the, majority, of, the, 1, 407, captured, american, merchant, ships, were, taken, by, the, royal, navy, the, war, was, the, last, time, the, british, allowed, privateering, since, the, practice, was, coming, to, be, seen, as, politically, inexpedient, and, of, diminishing, value, in, maintaining, its, naval, supremacy, however, privateering, remained, popular, in, british, colonies, it, was, the, last, hurrah, for, privateers, in, the, insular, british, north, american, colony, of, bermuda, who, vigorously, returned, to, the, practice, with, experience, gained, in, previous, wars, the, nimble, bermuda, sloops, captured, 298, american, ships, privateer, schooners, based, in, continental, british, north, america, especially, from, nova, scotia, took, 250, american, ships, and, proved, especially, effective, in, crippling, american, coastal, trade, and, capturing, american, ships, closer, to, shore, than, the, royal, navy, s, cruisers, the, naval, blockade, of, the, united, states, began, informally, in, the, late, fall, of, 1812, under, the, command, of, british, admiral, john, borlase, warren, it, extended, from, south, carolina, to, florida, it, expanded, to, cut, off, more, ports, as, the, war, progressed, twenty, ships, were, on, station, in, 1812, and, 135, were, in, place, by, the, end, of, the, conflict, in, march, 1813, the, royal, navy, punished, the, southern, states, who, were, most, vocal, about, annexing, british, north, america, by, blockading, charleston, port, royal, savannah, and, new, york, city, as, well, additional, ships, were, sent, to, north, america, in, 1813, and, the, royal, navy, tightened, and, extended, the, blockade, first, to, the, coast, south, of, narragansett, by, november, 1813, and, to, the, entire, american, coast, on, 31, may, 1814, in, may, 1814, following, the, abdication, of, napoleon, and, the, end, of, the, supply, problems, with, wellington, s, army, new, england, was, blockaded, the, british, needed, american, foodstuffs, for, their, army, in, spain, and, benefited, from, trade, with, new, england, so, they, did, not, at, first, blockade, new, england, the, delaware, river, and, chesapeake, bay, were, declared, in, a, state, of, blockade, on, 26, december, 1812, illicit, trade, was, carried, on, by, collusive, captures, arranged, between, american, traders, and, british, officers, american, ships, were, fraudulently, transferred, to, neutral, flags, eventually, the, united, states, government, was, driven, to, issue, orders, to, stop, illicit, trading, this, put, only, a, further, strain, on, the, commerce, of, the, country, the, british, fleet, occupied, the, chesapeake, bay, and, attacked, and, destroyed, numerous, docks, and, harbours, the, effect, was, that, no, foreign, goods, could, enter, the, united, states, on, ships, and, only, smaller, fast, boats, could, attempt, to, get, out, the, cost, of, shipping, became, very, expensive, as, a, result, the, blockade, of, american, ports, later, tightened, to, the, extent, that, most, american, merchant, ships, and, naval, vessels, were, confined, to, port, the, american, frigates, uss, united, states, and, uss, macedonian, ended, the, war, blockaded, and, hulked, in, new, london, connecticut, uss, united, states, and, uss, macedonian, attempted, to, set, sail, to, raid, british, shipping, in, the, caribbean, but, were, forced, to, turn, back, when, confronted, with, a, british, squadron, and, by, the, end, of, the, war, the, united, states, had, six, frigates, and, four, ships, of, the, line, sitting, in, port, some, merchant, ships, were, based, in, europe, or, asia, and, continued, operations, others, mainly, from, new, england, were, issued, licences, to, trade, by, admiral, warren, commander, in, chief, on, the, american, station, in, 1813, this, allowed, wellington, s, army, in, spain, to, receive, american, goods, and, to, maintain, the, new, englanders, opposition, to, the, war, the, blockade, nevertheless, decreased, american, exports, from, 130, million, in, 1807, to, 7, million, in, 1814, most, exports, were, goods, that, ironically, went, to, supply, their, enemies, in, britain, or, the, british, colonies, the, blockade, had, a, devastating, effect, on, the, american, economy, with, the, value, of, american, exports, and, imports, falling, from, 114, million, in, 1811, down, to, 20, million, by, 1814, while, the, united, states, customs, took, in, 13, million, in, 1811, and, 6, million, in, 1814, even, though, the, congress, had, voted, to,

inland, roads, in, 1814, only, 1, out, of, 14, american, merchantmen, risked, leaving, port, as, it, was, likely, that, any, ship, leaving, port, would, be, seized, as, the, royal, navy, base, that, supervised, the, blockade, halifax, profited, greatly, during, the, war, from, there, british, privateers, seized, and, sold, many, french, and, american, ships, more, than, a, hundred, prize, vessels, were, anchored, in, st, george, s, harbour, awaiting, condemnation, by, the, admiralty, court, when, a, hurricane, struck, in, 1815, sinking, roughly, sixty, of, the, vessels, the, british, royal, navy, s, blockades, and, raids, allowed, about, 4, 000, african, americans, to, escape, slavery, by, fleeing, american, plantations, aboard, british, ships, american, slaves, near, to, the, british, military, rebelled, against, their, masters, and, made, their, way, to, british, encampments, the, migrants, who, settled, in, canada, were, known, as, the, black, refugees, the, blockading, british, fleet, in, the, chesapeake, bay, received, increasing, numbers, of, freed, slaves, during, 1813, by, british, government, order, they, were, considered, free, persons, when, they, reached, british, hands, alexander, cochrane, s, proclamation, of, 2, april, 1814, invited, americans, who, wished, to, emigrate, to, join, the, british, although, it, did, not, explicitly, mention, slaves, it, was, taken, by, all, as, addressed, to, them, about, 2, 400, escaped, slaves, and, their, families, were, transported, by, the, royal, navy, to, the, royal, naval, dockyard, at, bermuda, where, they, were, employed, on, works, about, the, yard, and, organized, as, a, militia, to, aid, in, the, defence, of, the, yard, nova, scotia, and, new, brunswick, during, and, after, the, war, starting, in, may, 1814, younger, male, volunteers, were, recruited, into, a, new, corps, of, colonial, marines, they, fought, for, britain, throughout, the, atlantic, campaign, including, the, battle, of, bladensburg, the, attacks, on, washington, d, c, and, the, battle, of, baltimore, before, withdrawing, to, bermuda, with, the, rest, of, the, british, forces, they, were, later, settled, in, trinidad, after, having, rejected, orders, for, transfer, to, the, west, india, regiments, forming, the, community, of, the, merikins, none, of, the, freed, slaves, remained, in, bermuda, after, the, war, these, escaped, slaves, represented, the, largest, emancipation, of, african, americans, prior, to, the, american, civil, war, britain, paid, the, united, states, for, the, financial, loss, of, the, slaves, at, the, end, of, the, war, in, august, 1814, peace, discussions, began, in, ghent, both, sides, approached, negotiations, warily, the, british, strategy, for, decades, had, been, to, create, a, buffer, state, in, the, american, northwest, territory, to, block, american, expansion, britain, also, demanded, naval, control, of, the, great, lakes, and, access, to, the, mississippi, river, on, the, american, side, monroe, instructed, the, american, diplomats, sent, to, europe, to, try, to, convince, the, british, to, cede, the, canadas, or, at, least, upper, canada, to, the, u, s, at, a, later, stage, the, americans, also, demanded, damages, for, the, burning, of, washington, and, for, the, seizure, of, ships, before, the, war, began, american, public, opinion, was, outraged, when, madison, published, the, demands, as, even, the, federalists, were, now, willing, to, fight, on, a, british, force, burned, washington, but, it, failed, to, capture, baltimore, and, sailed, away, when, its, commander, was, killed, in, northern, new, york, state, 10, 000, british, veterans, were, marching, south, until, a, decisive, defeat, at, the, battle, of, plattsburgh, forced, them, back, to, canada, british, prime, minister, lord, liverpool, aware, of, growing, opposition, to, wartime, taxation, and, the, demands, of, merchants, for, reopened, trade, with, america, realized, britain, also, had, little, to, gain, and, much, to, lose, from, prolonged, warfare, especially, given, growing, concern, about, the, situation, in, europe, the, main, focus, of, british, foreign, policy, was, the, congress, of, vienna, at, which, british, diplomats, had, clashed, with, russian, and, prussian, diplomats, over, the, terms, of, the, peace, with, france, and, there, were, fears, that, britain, might, have, to, go, to, war, with, russia, and, prussia, export, trade, was, all, but, paralyzed, and, france, was, no, longer, an, enemy, of, britain, after, napoleon, fell, in, april, 1814, so, the, royal, navy, no, longer, needed, to, stop, american, shipments, to, france, and, it, no, longer, needed, to, impress, more, seamen, the, british, were, preoccupied, in, rebuilding, europe, after, the, apparent, final, defeat, of, napoleon, consequently, lord, liverpool, urged, the, british, negotiators, to, offer, a, peace, based, on, the, restoration, of, the, pre, war, status, quo, the, british, negotiators, duly, dropped, their, demands, for, the, creation, of, an, indian, neutral, zone, which, allowed, negotiations, to, resume, at, the, end, of, october, the, american, negotiators, accepted, the, british, proposals, for, a, peace, based, on, the, pre, war, status, quo, prisoners, were, to, be, exchanged, and, escaped, slaves, returned, to, the, united, states, as, at, least, 3, 000, american, slaves, had, escaped, to, british, lines, the, british, however, refused, to, honour, this, aspect, of, the, treaty, settling, some, of, the, newly, freed, slaves, in, nova, scotia, and, new, brunswick, the, americans, protested, britain, s, failure, to, return, american, slaves, in, violation, of, the, treaty, of, ghent, after, arbitration, by, the, tsar, of, russia, the, british, paid, 1, 204, 960, in, damages, to, washington, to, reimburse, the, slave, owners, on, 24, december, 1814, the, diplomats, had, finished, and, signed, the, treaty, of, ghent, the, treaty, was, ratified, by, the, british, prince, regent, three, days, later, on, 27, december, on, 17, february, it, arrived, in, washington, where, it, was, quickly, ratified, and, went, into, effect, ending, the, war, the, terms, called, for, all, occupied, territory, to, be, returned, the, prewar, boundary, between, canada, and, the, united, states, to, be, restored, and, the, americans, were, to, gain, fishing, rights, in, the, gulf, of, saint, lawrence, the, british, insisted, on, the, inclusion, of, provisions, to, restore, to, the, indians, all, possessions, rights, and, privileges, which, they, may, have, enjoyed, or, been, entitled, to, in, 1811, the, americans, ignored, and, violated, these, provisions, the, treaty, of, ghent, completely, maintained, britain, s, maritime, belligerent, rights, a, key, goal, for, the, british, without, acknowledging, american, maritime, rights, or, the, end, of, impressment, while, american, maritime, rights, were, not, seriously, violated, in, the, century, of, peace, until, world, war, i, the, defeat, of, napoleon, made, the, need, for, impressment, irrelevant, and, the, grievances, of, the, united, states, no, longer, an, issue, in, this, sense, the, united, states, achieved, its, goals, indirectly, and, felt, its, honour, had, been, upheld, despite, impressment, continuing, losses, figures, do, not, include, deaths, among, canadian, militia, forces, or, indigenous, tribes, british, losses, in, the, war, were, about, 1, 160, killed, in, action, and, 3, 679, wounded, with, 3, 321, british, who, died, from, disease, american, losses, were, 2, 260, killed, in, action, and, 4, 505, wounded, while, the, number, of, americans, who, died, from, disease, is, not, known, it, is, estimated, that, about, 15, 000, died, from, all, causes, directly, related, to, the, war, the, war, added, some, 25, million, to, britain, s, national, debt, in, the, united, states, the, cost, was, 105, million, the, national, debt, rose, from, 45, million, in, 1812, to, 127, million, by, the, end, of, 1815, although, by, selling, bonds, and, treasury, notes, at, deep, discounts, and, often, for, irredeemable, paper, money, due, to, the, suspension, of, specie, payment, in, 1814, the, government, received, only, 34, million, worth, of, specie, stephen, girard, the, richest, man, in, the, united, states, at, the, time, was, among, those, who, funded, the, united, states, government, s, involvement, in, the, war, the, british, national, debt, rose, from, 451, million, in, 1812, to, 841, million, in, 1814, although, this, was, at, a, time, when, britain, was, fighting, a, war, against, napoleon, the, war, was, bad, for, both, economies, in, the, united, states, the, economy, grew, 3, 7, a, year, from, 1812, to, 1815, despite, a, large, loss, of, business, by, east, coast, shipping, interests, prices, were, 15, higher, inflated, in, 1815, compared, to, 1812, an, annual, rate, of, 4, 8, hundreds, of, new, banks, were, opened, they, largely, handled, the, loans, that, financed, the, war, since, tax, revenues, were, down, money, that, would, have, been, spent, on, foreign, trade, was, diverted, to, opening, new, factories, which, were, profitable, since, british, factory, made, products, were, not, for, sale, this, gave, a, major, boost, to, the, industrial, revolution, in, the, united, states, as, typified, by, the, boston, associates, the, border, between, the, united, states, and, canada, remained, essentially, unchanged, by, the, war, with, neither, side, making, meaningful, territorial, gains, despite, the, treaty, of, ghent, not, addressing, the, original, points, of, contention, and, establishing, the, status, quo, ante, bellum, relations, between, the, united, states, and, britain, changed, drastically, the, issue, of, impressment, also, became, irrelevant, as, the, royal, navy, no, longer, needed, sailors, after, the, war, the, long, term, results, of, the, war, were, generally, satisfactory, for, both, the, united, states, and, great, britain, except, for, occasional, border, disputes, and, some, tensions, during, and, after, the, american, civil, war, relations, between, the, united, states, and, britain, remained, peaceful, for, the, rest, of, the, 19th, century, in, the, 20th, century, spurred, by, multiple, world, conflicts, the, two, countries, became, close, allies, the, memory, of, the, conflict, played, a, major, role, in, helping, to, consolidate, a, canadian, national, identity, after, 1867, the, year, of, canadian, confederation, the, rush, bagot, treaty, between, the, united, states, and, britain, was, enacted, in, 1817, it, demilitarized, the, great, lakes, and, lake, champlain, where, many, british, naval, arrangements, and, forts, still, remained, the, treaty, laid, the, basis, for, a, demilitarized, boundary, it, remains, in, effect, to, this, day, bermuda, had, been, largely, left, to, the, defences, of, its, own, militia, and, privateers, before, american, independence, but, the, royal, navy, had, begun, buying, up, land, and, operating, from, there, beginning, in, 1795, after, a, number, of, years, spent, surveying, the, reefs, to, find, hurd, s, channel, which, enabled, large, frigates, and, ships, of, the, line, to, pass, through, the, surrounding, reefs, to, murray, s, anchorage, and, the, enclosed, harbours, as, construction, work, progressed, through, the, first, half, of, the, 19th, century, bermuda, became, an, imperial, fortress, and, the, permanent, naval, headquarters, the, western, hemisphere, housing, the, admiralty, and, serving, as, a, base, and, dockyard, defence, infrastructure, remained, the, central, leg, of, bermuda, s, economy, until, after, world, war, ii, after, the, war, pro, british, leaders, in, upper, canada, demonstrated, a, strong, hostility, to, american, influences, including, republicanism, which, shaped, its, policies, immigration, from, the, united, states, was, discouraged, and, favour, was, shown, to, the, anglican, church, as, opposed, to, the, more, americanized, methodist, church, the, battle, of, york, showed, the, vulnerability, of, upper, and, lower, canada, the, canadas, in, the, decades, following, the, war, several, projects, were, undertaken, to, improve, the, defence, of, the, colonies, against, the, united, states, they, included, work, on, la, citadelle, at, quebec, city, fort, henry, at, kingston, and, rebuilding, fort, york, at, york, additionally, work, began, on, the, halifax, citadel, to, defend, the, port, against, foreign, navies, akin, to, the, american, view, that, it, was, a, second, war, of, independence, for, the, united, states, the, war, was, also, somewhat, of, a, war, of, independence, for, canada, before, the, war, canada, was, a, mix, of, french, canadians, native, born, british, subjects, loyalists, and, americans, who, migrated, there, historian, donald, r, hickey, maintains, that, the, war, that, threatened, canada, greatly, helped, to, cement, these, disparate, groups, into, a, unified, nation, the, indigenous, tribes, allied, to, the, british, lost, their, cause, the, americans, rejected, the, british, proposal, to, create, an, indian, barrier, state, in, the, american, west, at, the, ghent, peace, conference, and, it, never, resurfaced, donald, fixico, argues, that, fter, the, war, of, 1812, the, u, s, negotiated, over, two, hundred, indian, treaties, that, involved, the, ceding, of, indian, lands, and, 99, of, these, agreements, resulted, in, the, creation, of, reservations, west, of, the, mississippi, river, the, indigenous, nations, lost, most, of, their, fur, trapping, territory, indigenous, nations, were, displaced, in, alabama, georgia, new, york, and, oklahoma, losing, most, of, what, is, now, indiana, michigan, ohio, and, wisconsin, within, the, northwest, territory, as, well, as, in, new, york, and, the, south, they, came, to, be, seen, as, an, undesirable, burden, by, british, policymakers, who, now, looked, to, the, united, states, for, markets, and, raw, materials, everyone, including, british, fur, traders, were, prohibited, from, entering, in, the, united, states, for, purposes, of, trade, british, indian, agents, however, continued, to, meet, regularly, with, their, former, allies, among, the, tribes, of, the, old, northwest, but, refused, to, supply, them, with, arms, or, help, them, resist, american, attempts, to, displace, them, the, american, government, rapidly, built, a, network, of, forts, throughout, the, old, northwest, thus, establishing, firm, military, control, it, also, sponsored, american, fur, traders, who, outcompeted, the, british, fur, traders, meanwhile, euro, american, settlers, rapidly, migrated, into, the, old, northwest, into, the, lands, occupied, by, the, tribes, who, were, previously, allied, with, the, british, the, war, of, 1812, marked, a, turning, point, in, the, history, of, the, old, northwest, because, it, established, united, states, authority, over, the, british, and, indians, of, that, border, region, after, the, decisive, defeat, of, the, creek, indians, at, the, battle, of, horseshoe, bend, in, 1814, some, creek, warriors, escaped, to, join, the, seminole, in, florida, the, remaining, creek, chiefs, signed, away, about, half, their, lands, comprising, 23, 000, 000, acres, covering, much, of, southern, georgia, and, two, thirds, of, modern, alabama, the, creek, were, separated, from, any, future, help, from, the, spanish, in, florida, and, from, the, choctaw, and, chickasaw, to, the, west, the, war, is, seldom, remembered, in, the, united, kingdom, the, war, in, europe, against, the, french, empire, under, napoleon, ensured, that, the, british, did, not, consider, the, war, of, 1812, against, the, united, states, as, more, than, a, sideshow, britain, s, blockade, of, french, trade, had, worked, and, the, royal, navy, was, the, world, s, dominant, nautical, power, and, remained, so, for, another, century, while, the, land, campaigns, had, contributed, to, saving, canada, the, royal, navy, had, shut, down, american, commerce, bottled, up, the, united, states, navy, in, port, and, widely, suppressed, privateering, british, businesses, some, affected, by, rising, insurance, costs, were, demanding, peace, so, that, trade, could, resume, with, the, united, states, the, peace, was, generally, welcomed, by, the, british, although, there, was, disquiet, about, the, rapid, growth, of, the, united, states, the, two, nations, quickly, resumed, trade, after, the, end, of, the, war, and, a, growing, friendship, the, historian, donald, hickey, maintains, that, for, britain, the, best, way, to, defend, canada, was, to, accommodate, the, united, states, this, was, the, principal, rationale, for, britain, s, long, term, policy, of, rapprochement, with, the, united, states, in, the, nineteenth, century, and, explains, why, they, were, so, often, willing, to, sacrifice, other, imperial, interests, to, keep, the, republic, happy, the, nation, gained, a, strong, sense, of, complete, independence, as, people, celebrated, their, second, war, of, independence, nationalism, soared, after, the, victory, at, the, battle, of, new, orleans, the, opposition, federalist, party, collapsed, due, to, its, opposition, to, the, war, and, the, era, of, good, feelings, ensued, no, longer, questioning, the, need, for, a, strong, navy, the, united, states, built, three, new, 74, gun, ships, of, the, line, and, two, new, 44, gun, frigates, shortly, after, the, end, of, the, war, in, 1816, the, united, states, congress, passed, into, law, an, act, for, the, gradual, increase, of, the, navy, at, a, cost, of, 1, 000, 000, a, year, for, eight, years, authorizing, nine, ships, of, the, line, and, 12, heavy, frigates, the, captains, and, commodores, of, the, navy, became, the, heroes, of, their, generation, in, the, united, states, several, war, heroes, used, their, fame, to, win, elections, to, national, office, andrew, jackson, and, william, henry, harrison, both, benefited, from, their, military, successes, to, win, the, presidency, while, representative, richard, mentor, johnson, s, role, during, the, war, helped, him, attain, the, vice, presidency, during, the, war, new, england, states, became, increasingly, frustrated, over, how, the, war, was, being, conducted, and, how, the, conflict, affected, them, they, complained, that, the, united, states, government, was, not, investing, enough, militarily, and, financially, in, the, states, defences, and, that, the, states, should, have, more, control, over, their, militias, increased, taxes, the, british, blockade, and, the, occupation, of, some, of, new, england, by, enemy, forces, also, agitated, public, opinion, in, the, states, at, the, hartford, convention, held, between, december, 1814, and, january, 1815, federalist, delegates, deprecated, the, war, effort, and, sought, more, autonomy, for, the, new, england, states, they, did, not, call, for, secession, but, word, of, the, angry, anti, war, resolutions, appeared, as, peace, was, announced, and, the, victory, at, new, orleans, was, known, the, upshot, was, that, the, federalists, were, permanently, discredited, and, quickly, disappeared, as, a, major, political, force, this, war, enabled, thousands, of, slaves, to, escape, to, freedom, despite, the, difficulties, the, british, helped, numerous, escaped, slaves, resettle, in, new, brunswick, and, nova, scotia, where, black, loyalists, had, also, been, granted, land, after, the, american, revolutionary, war, jackson, invaded, florida, then, part, of, new, spain, in, 1818, demonstrating, to, spain, that, it, could, no, longer, control, that, colonial, territory, with, a, small, force, spain, sold, florida, to, the, united, states, in, 1819, under, the, adams, on, s, treaty, following, the, first, seminole, war, pratt, concludes, that, hus, indirectly, the, war, of, 1812, brought, about, the, acquisition, of, florida, the, historiography, of, the, war, of, 1812, reflects, the, numerous, interpretations, of, the, conflict, especially, in, reference, to, the, war, s, outcome, the, historical, record, has, interpreted, both, the, british, and, americans, as, victors, in, the, conflict, with, substantial, academic, and, popular, literature, published, to, support, each, claim, the, british, viewed, the, war, of, 1812, as, a, minor, theatre, that, was, overshadowed, by, key, victories, at, the, battle, of, trafalgar, in, 1805, and, the, battle, of, waterloo, in, 1815, leading, to, the, pax, britannica, in, the, united, states, and, upper, canada, nationalistic, mythology, around, the, war, took,
