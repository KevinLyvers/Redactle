the, goths, were, germanic, people, who, played, a, major, role, in, the, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, and, the, emergence, of, medieval, europe, in, the, late, 4th, century, the, lands, of, the, goths, were, invaded, from, the, east, by, the, huns, in, the, aftermath, of, this, event, several, groups, of, goths, came, under, hunnic, domination, while, others, migrated, further, west, or, sought, refuge, inside, the, roman, empire, goths, who, entered, the, empire, by, crossing, the, danube, inflicted, a, devastating, defeat, upon, the, romans, at, the, battle, of, adrianople, in, 378, these, goths, would, form, the, visigoths, and, under, their, king, alaric, i, they, began, a, long, migration, eventually, establishing, a, visigothic, kingdom, in, spain, at, toledo, meanwhile, goths, under, hunnic, rule, gained, their, independence, in, the, 5th, century, most, importantly, the, ostrogoths, under, their, king, theodoric, the, great, these, goths, established, an, ostrogothic, kingdom, in, italy, at, ravenna, the, ostrogothic, kingdom, was, destroyed, by, the, eastern, roman, empire, in, the, 6th, century, while, the, visigothic, kingdom, was, largely, conquered, by, the, umayyad, caliphate, in, the, early, 8th, century, with, a, remnant, in, asturias, which, would, go, on, to, initiate, the, reconquista, under, pelagius, remnants, of, gothic, communities, in, crimea, known, as, the, crimean, goths, lingered, on, for, several, centuries, although, goths, would, eventually, cease, to, exist, as, a, distinct, people, in, the, gothic, language, the, goths, were, called, the, gut, iuda, gothic, people, or, gutans, goths, the, proto, germanic, form, of, the, gothic, name, is, gut, z, which, co, existed, with, an, n, stem, variant, gutaniz, attested, in, gutones, gutani, or, gutniskr, the, form, gut, z, is, identical, to, that, of, the, gutes, from, gotland, sweden, and, closely, related, to, that, of, the, geats, gaut, z, from, mainland, sweden, though, these, names, probably, mean, the, same, their, exact, meaning, is, uncertain, they, are, all, thought, to, be, related, to, the, proto, germanic, verb, geuta, which, means, to, pour, the, etymology, of, the, demonym, goths, is, closely, related, to, that, of, the, swedish, gutes, geats, and, perhaps, jutes, in, his, book, getica, c, 551, the, historian, jordanes, writes, that, the, goths, originated, in, southern, scandinavia, but, the, accuracy, of, this, account, is, unclear, a, people, called, the, gutones, possibly, early, goths, are, documented, living, near, the, lower, vistula, river, in, current, poland, in, the, 1st, century, where, they, are, associated, with, the, archaeological, wielbark, culture, from, the, 2nd, century, the, wielbark, culture, expanded, southwards, towards, the, black, sea, in, what, has, been, associated, with, gothic, migration, and, by, the, late, 3rd, century, it, contributed, to, the, formation, of, the, chernyakhov, culture, by, the, 4th, century, at, the, latest, several, gothic, groups, were, distinguishable, among, whom, the, thervingi, and, greuthungi, were, the, most, powerful, during, this, time, wulfila, began, the, conversion, of, goths, to, christianity, the, goths, are, classified, as, a, germanic, people, in, modern, scholarship, along, with, the, burgundians, vandals, and, others, they, belong, to, the, east, germanic, group, roman, authors, of, late, antiquity, did, not, classify, the, goths, as, germani, in, modern, scholarship, the, goths, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, being, germani, a, crucial, source, on, gothic, history, is, the, getica, of, the, 6th, century, historian, jordanes, who, may, have, been, of, gothic, descent, jordanes, claims, to, have, based, the, getica, on, an, earlier, lost, work, by, cassiodorus, but, also, cites, material, from, fifteen, other, classical, sources, including, an, otherwise, unknown, writer, ablabius, many, scholars, accept, that, jordanes, account, on, gothic, origins, is, at, least, partially, derived, from, gothic, tribal, tradition, and, accurate, on, certain, details, according, to, jordanes, the, goths, originated, on, an, island, called, scandza, scandinavia, from, where, they, emigrated, by, sea, to, an, area, called, gothiscandza, under, their, king, berig, historians, are, not, in, agreement, on, the, authenticity, and, accuracy, of, this, account, most, scholars, agree, that, gothic, migration, from, scandinavia, is, reflected, in, the, archaeological, record, but, the, evidence, is, not, entirely, clear, rather, than, a, single, mass, migration, of, an, entire, people, scholars, open, to, hypothetical, scandinavian, origins, envision, a, process, of, gradual, migration, in, the, 1st, centuries, bc, and, ad, which, was, probably, preceded, by, long, term, contacts, and, perhaps, limited, to, a, few, elite, clans, from, scandinavia, similarities, between, the, name, of, the, goths, some, swedish, place, names, and, the, names, of, the, gutes, and, geats, have, been, cited, as, evidence, that, the, goths, originated, in, gotland, or, g, taland, the, goths, geats, and, gutes, may, all, have, descended, from, an, early, community, of, seafarers, active, on, both, sides, of, the, baltic, similarities, and, dissimilarities, between, the, gothic, language, and, scandinavian, languages, particularly, gutnish, have, been, cited, as, evidence, both, for, and, against, a, scandinavian, origin, scholars, generally, locate, gothiscandza, in, the, area, of, the, wielbark, culture, this, culture, emerged, in, the, lower, vistula, and, along, the, pomeranian, coast, in, the, 1st, century, ad, replacing, the, preceding, oksywie, culture, it, is, primarily, distinguished, from, the, oksywie, by, the, practice, of, inhumation, the, absence, of, weapons, in, graves, and, the, presence, of, stone, circles, this, area, had, been, intimately, connected, with, scandinavia, since, the, time, of, the, nordic, bronze, age, and, the, lusatian, culture, its, inhabitants, in, the, wielbark, period, are, usually, thought, to, have, been, germanic, peoples, such, as, the, goths, and, rugii, jordanes, writes, that, the, goths, soon, after, settling, gothiscandza, seized, the, lands, of, the, ulmerugi, rugii, the, goths, are, generally, believed, to, have, been, first, attested, by, greco, roman, sources, in, the, 1st, century, under, the, name, gutones, the, equation, between, gutones, and, later, goths, is, disputed, by, several, historians, around, 15, ad, strabo, mentions, the, butones, lugii, and, semnones, as, part, of, a, large, group, of, peoples, who, came, under, the, domination, of, the, marcomannic, king, maroboduus, the, butones, are, generally, equated, with, the, gutones, the, lugii, have, sometimes, been, considered, the, same, people, as, the, vandals, with, whom, they, were, certainly, closely, affiliated, the, vandals, are, associated, with, the, przeworsk, culture, which, was, located, to, the, south, of, the, wielbark, culture, wolfram, suggests, that, the, gutones, were, clients, of, the, lugii, and, vandals, in, the, 1st, century, ad, in, 77, ad, pliny, the, elder, mentions, the, gutones, as, one, of, the, peoples, of, germania, he, writes, that, the, gutones, burgundiones, varini, and, carini, belong, to, the, vandili, pliny, classifies, the, vandili, as, one, of, the, five, principal, german, races, along, with, the, coastal, ingvaeones, istvaeones, irminones, and, peucini, in, an, earlier, chapter, pliny, writes, that, the, 4th, century, bc, traveler, pytheas, encountered, a, people, called, the, guiones, some, scholars, have, equated, these, guiones, with, the, gutones, but, the, authenticity, of, the, pytheas, account, is, uncertain, in, his, work, germania, from, around, 98, ad, tacitus, writes, that, the, gotones, or, gothones, and, the, neighbouring, rugii, and, lemovii, were, germani, who, carried, round, shields, and, short, swords, and, lived, near, the, ocean, beyond, the, vandals, he, described, them, as, ruled, by, kings, a, little, more, strictly, than, the, other, german, tribes, in, another, notable, work, the, annals, tacitus, writes, that, the, gotones, had, assisted, catualda, a, young, marcomannic, exile, in, overthrowing, the, rule, of, maroboduus, prior, to, this, it, is, probable, that, both, the, gutones, and, vandals, had, been, subjects, of, the, marcomanni, sometime, after, settling, gothiscandza, jordanes, writes, that, the, goths, defeated, the, neighbouring, vandals, wolfram, believes, the, gutones, freed, themselves, from, vandalic, domination, at, the, beginning, of, the, 2nd, century, ad, in, his, geography, from, around, 150, ad, ptolemy, mentions, the, gythones, or, gutones, as, living, east, of, the, vistula, in, sarmatia, between, the, veneti, and, the, fenni, in, an, earlier, chapter, he, mentions, a, people, called, the, gutae, or, gautae, as, living, in, southern, scandia, these, gutae, are, probably, the, same, as, the, later, gauti, mentioned, by, procopius, wolfram, suggests, that, there, were, close, relations, between, the, gythones, and, gutae, and, that, they, might, have, been, of, common, origin, beginning, in, the, middle, of, the, 2nd, century, the, wielbark, culture, shifted, southeast, towards, the, black, sea, during, this, time, the, wielbark, culture, is, believed, to, have, ejected, and, partially, absorbed, peoples, of, the, przeworsk, culture, this, was, part, of, a, wider, southward, movement, of, eastern, germanic, tribes, which, was, probably, caused, by, massive, population, growth, as, a, result, other, tribes, were, pushed, towards, the, roman, empire, contributing, to, the, beginning, of, the, marcomannic, wars, by, 200, ad, wielbark, goths, were, probably, being, recruited, into, the, roman, army, according, to, jordanes, the, goths, entered, oium, part, of, scythia, under, the, king, filimer, where, they, defeated, the, spali, this, migration, account, partly, corresponds, with, the, archaeological, evidence, the, name, spali, may, mean, the, giants, in, slavic, and, the, spali, were, thus, probably, not, slavs, in, the, early, 3rd, century, ad, western, scythia, was, inhabited, by, the, agricultural, zarubintsy, culture, and, the, nomadic, sarmatians, prior, to, the, sarmatians, the, area, had, been, settled, by, the, bastarnae, who, are, believed, to, have, carried, out, a, migration, similar, to, the, goths, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, peter, heather, considers, the, filimer, story, to, be, at, least, partially, derived, from, gothic, oral, tradition, the, fact, that, the, expanding, goths, appear, to, have, preserved, their, gothic, language, during, their, migration, suggests, that, their, movement, involved, a, fairly, large, number, of, people, by, the, mid, 3rd, century, ad, the, wielbark, culture, had, contributed, to, the, formation, of, the, chernyakhov, culture, in, scythia, this, strikingly, uniform, culture, came, to, stretch, from, the, danube, in, the, west, to, the, don, in, the, east, it, is, believed, to, have, been, dominated, by, the, goths, and, other, germanic, groups, such, as, the, heruli, it, nevertheless, also, included, iranian, dacian, roman, and, probably, slavic, elements, as, well, the, first, incursion, of, the, roman, empire, that, can, be, attributed, to, goths, is, the, sack, of, histria, in, 238, the, first, references, to, the, goths, in, the, 3rd, century, call, them, scythians, as, this, area, known, as, scythia, had, historically, been, occupied, by, an, unrelated, people, of, that, name, it, is, in, the, late, 3rd, century, that, the, name, goths, latin, gothi, is, first, mentioned, ancient, authors, do, not, identify, the, goths, with, the, earlier, gutones, philologists, and, linguists, have, no, doubt, that, the, names, are, linked, on, the, pontic, steppe, the, goths, quickly, adopted, several, nomadic, customs, from, the, sarmatians, they, excelled, at, horsemanship, archery, and, falconry, and, were, also, accomplished, agriculturalists, and, seafarers, j, b, bury, describes, the, gothic, period, as, the, only, non, nomadic, episode, in, the, history, of, the, steppe, william, h, mcneill, compares, the, migration, of, the, goths, to, that, of, the, early, mongols, who, migrated, southward, from, the, forests, and, came, to, dominate, the, eastern, eurasian, steppe, around, the, same, time, as, the, goths, in, the, west, from, the, 240s, at, the, earliest, goths, were, heavily, recruited, into, the, roman, army, to, fight, in, the, roman, persian, wars, notably, participating, at, the, battle, of, misiche, in, 244, an, inscription, at, the, ka, ba, ye, zartosht, in, parthian, persian, and, greek, commemorates, the, persian, victory, over, the, romans, and, the, troops, drawn, from, gwt, w, g, rmny, x, tr, the, gothic, and, german, kingdoms, which, is, probably, a, parthian, gloss, for, the, danubian, gothic, limes, and, the, germanic, limes, meanwhile, gothic, raids, on, the, roman, empire, continued, in, 250, 51, the, gothic, king, cniva, captured, the, city, of, philippopolis, and, inflicted, a, devastating, defeat, upon, the, romans, at, the, battle, of, abrittus, in, which, the, roman, emperor, decius, was, killed, this, was, one, of, the, most, disastrous, defeats, in, the, history, of, the, roman, army, the, first, gothic, seaborne, raids, took, place, in, the, 250s, the, first, two, incursions, into, asia, minor, took, place, between, 253, and, 256, and, are, attributed, to, boranoi, by, zosimus, this, may, not, be, an, ethnic, term, but, may, just, mean, people, from, the, north, it, is, unknown, if, goths, were, involved, in, these, first, raids, gregory, thaumaturgus, attributes, a, third, attack, to, goths, and, boradoi, and, claims, that, some, forgetting, that, they, were, men, of, pontus, and, christians, joined, the, invaders, an, unsuccessful, attack, on, pityus, was, followed, in, the, second, year, by, another, which, sacked, pityus, and, trabzon, and, ravaged, large, areas, in, the, pontus, in, the, third, year, a, much, larger, force, devastated, large, areas, of, bithynia, and, the, propontis, including, the, cities, of, chalcedon, nicomedia, nicaea, apamea, myrlea, cius, and, bursa, by, the, end, of, the, raids, the, goths, had, seized, control, over, crimea, and, the, bosporus, and, captured, several, cities, on, the, euxine, coast, including, olbia, and, tyras, which, enabled, them, to, engage, in, widespread, naval, activities, after, a, 10, year, hiatus, the, goths, and, the, heruli, with, a, raiding, fleet, of, 500, ships, sacked, heraclea, pontica, cyzicus, and, byzantium, they, were, defeated, by, the, roman, navy, but, managed, to, escape, into, the, aegean, sea, where, they, ravaged, the, islands, of, lemnos, and, scyros, broke, through, thermopylae, and, sacked, several, cities, of, southern, greece, province, of, achaea, including, athens, corinth, argos, olympia, and, sparta, then, an, athenian, militia, led, by, the, historian, dexippus, pushed, the, invaders, to, the, north, where, they, were, intercepted, by, the, roman, army, under, gallienus, he, won, an, important, victory, near, the, nessos, nestos, river, on, the, boundary, between, macedonia, and, thrace, the, dalmatian, cavalry, of, the, roman, army, earning, a, reputation, as, good, fighters, reported, barbarian, casualties, were, 3, 000, men, subsequently, the, heruli, leader, naulobatus, came, to, terms, with, the, romans, after, gallienus, was, assassinated, outside, milan, in, the, summer, of, 268, in, a, plot, led, by, high, officers, in, his, army, claudius, was, proclaimed, emperor, and, headed, to, rome, to, establish, his, rule, claudius, immediate, concerns, were, with, the, alamanni, who, had, invaded, raetia, and, italy, after, he, defeated, them, in, the, battle, of, lake, benacus, he, was, finally, able, to, take, care, of, the, invasions, in, the, balkan, provinces, in, the, meantime, a, second, and, larger, sea, borne, invasion, had, started, an, enormous, coalition, consisting, of, goths, greuthungi, and, thervingi, gepids, and, peucini, led, again, by, the, heruli, assembled, at, the, mouth, of, river, tyras, dniester, the, augustan, history, and, zosimus, claim, a, total, number, of, 2, 000, 6, 000, ships, and, 325, 000, men, this, is, probably, a, gross, exaggeration, but, remains, indicative, of, the, scale, of, the, invasion, after, failing, to, storm, some, towns, on, the, coasts, of, the, western, black, sea, and, the, danube, tomi, marcianopolis, the, invaders, attacked, byzantium, and, chrysopolis, part, of, their, fleet, was, wrecked, either, because, of, the, goth, s, inexperience, in, sailing, through, the, violent, currents, of, the, propontis, or, because, they, were, defeated, by, the, roman, navy, then, they, entered, the, aegean, sea, and, a, detachment, ravaged, the, aegean, islands, as, far, as, crete, rhodes, and, cyprus, according, to, the, augustan, history, the, goths, achieved, no, success, on, this, expedition, because, they, were, struck, by, the, cyprianic, plague, the, fleet, probably, also, sacked, troy, and, ephesus, damaging, the, temple, of, artemis, though, the, temple, was, repaired, and, then, later, torn, down, by, christians, a, century, later, one, of, the, seven, wonders, of, the, ancient, world, while, their, main, force, had, constructed, siege, works, and, was, close, to, taking, the, cities, of, thessalonica, and, cassandreia, it, retreated, to, the, balkan, interior, at, the, news, that, the, emperor, was, advancing, learning, of, the, approach, of, claudius, the, goths, first, attempted, to, directly, invade, italy, they, were, engaged, near, naissus, by, a, roman, army, led, by, claudius, advancing, from, the, north, the, battle, most, likely, took, place, in, 269, and, was, fiercely, contested, large, numbers, on, both, sides, were, killed, but, at, the, critical, point, the, romans, tricked, the, goths, into, an, ambush, by, pretending, to, retreat, some, 50, 000, goths, were, allegedly, killed, or, taken, captive, and, their, base, at, thessalonika, destroyed, apparently, aurelian, who, was, in, charge, of, all, roman, cavalry, during, claudius, reign, led, the, decisive, attack, in, the, battle, some, survivors, were, resettled, within, the, empire, while, others, were, incorporated, into, the, roman, army, the, battle, ensured, the, survival, of, the, roman, empire, for, another, two, centuries, in, 270, after, the, death, of, claudius, goths, under, the, leadership, of, cannabaudes, again, launched, an, invasion, of, the, roman, empire, but, were, defeated, by, aurelian, who, however, did, surrender, dacia, beyond, the, danube, around, 275, the, goths, launched, a, last, major, assault, on, asia, minor, where, piracy, by, black, sea, goths, was, causing, great, trouble, in, colchis, pontus, cappadocia, galatia, and, even, cilicia, they, were, defeated, sometime, in, 276, by, emperor, marcus, claudius, tacitus, by, the, late, 3rd, century, there, were, at, least, two, groups, of, goths, separated, by, the, dniester, river, the, thervingi, and, the, greuthungi, the, gepids, who, lived, northwest, of, the, goths, are, also, attested, as, this, time, jordanes, writes, that, the, gepids, shared, common, origins, with, the, goths, in, the, late, 3rd, century, as, recorded, by, jordanes, the, gepids, under, their, king, fastida, utterly, defeated, the, burgundians, and, then, attacked, the, goths, and, their, king, ostrogotha, out, of, this, conflict, ostrogotha, and, the, goths, emerged, victorious, in, the, last, decades, of, the, 3rd, century, large, numbers, of, carpi, are, recorded, as, fleeing, dacia, for, the, roman, empire, having, probably, been, driven, from, the, area, by, goths, in, 332, constantine, helped, the, sarmatians, to, settle, on, the, north, banks, of, the, danube, to, defend, against, the, goths, attacks, and, thereby, enforce, the, roman, border, around, 100, 000, goths, were, reportedly, killed, in, battle, and, aoric, son, of, the, thervingian, king, ariaric, was, captured, eusebius, a, historian, who, wrote, in, greek, in, the, third, century, wrote, that, in, 334, constantine, evacuated, approximately, 300, 000, sarmatians, from, the, north, bank, of, the, danube, after, a, revolt, of, the, sarmatians, slaves, from, 335, to, 336, constantine, continuing, his, danube, campaign, defeated, many, gothic, tribes, having, been, driven, from, the, danube, by, the, romans, the, thervingi, invaded, the, territory, of, the, sarmatians, of, the, tisza, in, this, conflict, the, thervingi, were, led, by, vidigoia, the, bravest, of, the, goths, and, were, victorious, although, vidigoia, was, killed, jordanes, states, that, aoric, was, succeeded, by, geberic, a, man, renowned, for, his, valor, and, noble, birth, who, waged, war, on, the, hasdingi, vandals, and, their, king, visimar, forcing, them, to, settle, in, pannonia, under, roman, protection, both, the, greuthungi, and, thervingi, became, heavily, romanized, during, the, 4th, century, this, came, about, through, trade, with, the, romans, as, well, as, through, gothic, membership, of, a, military, covenant, which, was, based, in, byzantium, and, involved, pledges, of, military, assistance, reportedly, 40, 000, goths, were, brought, by, constantine, to, defend, constantinople, in, his, later, reign, and, the, palace, guard, was, thereafter, mostly, composed, of, germanic, warriors, as, roman, soldiers, by, this, time, had, largely, lost, military, value, the, goths, increasingly, became, soldiers, in, the, roman, armies, in, the, 4th, century, leading, to, a, significant, germanization, of, the, roman, army, without, the, recruitment, of, germanic, warriors, in, the, roman, army, the, roman, empire, would, not, have, survived, for, as, long, as, it, did, goths, who, gained, prominent, positions, in, the, roman, military, include, gainas, tribigild, fravitta, and, aspar, mardonius, a, gothic, eunuch, was, the, childhood, tutor, and, later, adviser, of, roman, emperor, julian, on, whom, he, had, an, immense, influence, the, gothic, penchant, for, wearing, skins, became, fashionable, in, constantinople, a, fashion, which, was, loudly, denounced, by, conservatives, the, 4th, century, greek, bishop, synesius, compared, the, goths, to, wolves, among, sheep, mocked, them, for, wearing, skins, and, questioned, their, loyalty, towards, rome, a, man, in, skins, leading, warriors, who, wear, the, chlamys, exchanging, his, sheepskins, for, the, toga, to, debate, with, roman, magistrates, and, perhaps, even, sit, next, to, a, roman, consul, while, law, abiding, men, sit, behind, then, these, same, men, once, they, have, gone, a, little, way, from, the, senate, house, put, on, their, sheepskins, again, and, when, they, have, rejoined, their, fellows, they, mock, the, toga, saying, that, they, cannot, comfortably, draw, their, swords, in, it, in, the, 4th, century, geberic, was, succeeded, by, the, greuthungian, king, ermanaric, who, embarked, on, a, large, scale, expansion, jordanes, states, that, ermanaric, conquered, a, large, number, of, warlike, tribes, including, the, heruli, who, were, led, by, alaric, the, aesti, and, the, vistula, veneti, who, although, militarily, weak, were, very, numerous, and, put, up, a, strong, resistance, jordanes, compares, the, conquests, of, ermanaric, to, those, of, alexander, the, great, and, states, that, he, ruled, all, the, nations, of, scythia, and, germany, by, his, own, prowess, alone, interpreting, jordanes, herwig, wolfram, estimates, that, ermanaric, dominated, a, vast, area, of, the, pontic, steppe, stretching, from, the, baltic, sea, to, the, black, sea, as, far, eastwards, as, the, ural, mountains, encompassing, not, only, the, greuthungi, but, also, baltic, finnic, peoples, slavs, such, as, the, antes, rosomoni, roxolani, alans, huns, sarmatians, and, probably, aestii, balts, according, to, wolfram, it, is, certainly, possible, that, the, sphere, of, influence, of, the, chernyakhov, culture, could, have, extended, well, beyond,

the, other, hand, contends, that, the, extent, of, ermanaric, s, power, is, exaggerated, ermanaric, s, possible, dominance, of, the, volga, don, trade, routes, has, led, historian, gottfried, schramm, to, consider, his, realm, a, forerunner, of, the, viking, founded, state, of, kievan, rus, in, the, western, part, of, gothic, territories, dominated, by, the, thervingi, there, were, also, populations, of, taifali, sarmatians, and, other, iranian, peoples, dacians, daco, romans, and, other, romanized, populations, according, to, hervarar, saga, ok, hei, reks, the, saga, of, herv, r, and, heidrek, a, 13th, century, legendary, saga, rheimar, was, the, capital, of, reidgotaland, the, land, of, the, goths, the, saga, states, that, it, was, located, on, the, dnieper, river, jordanes, refers, to, the, region, as, oium, in, the, 360s, athanaric, son, of, aoric, and, leader, of, the, thervingi, supported, the, usurper, procopius, against, the, eastern, roman, emperor, valens, in, retaliation, valens, invaded, the, territories, of, athanaric, and, defeated, him, but, was, unable, to, achieve, a, decisive, victory, athanaric, and, valens, thereupon, negotiated, a, peace, treaty, favorable, to, the, thervingi, on, a, boat, in, the, danube, river, as, athanaric, refused, to, set, his, feet, within, the, roman, empire, soon, afterwards, fritigern, a, rival, of, athanaric, converted, to, arianism, gaining, the, favor, of, valens, athanaric, and, fritigern, thereafter, fought, a, civil, war, in, which, athanaric, appears, to, have, been, victorious, athanaric, thereafter, carried, out, a, crackdown, on, christianity, in, his, realm, around, 375, the, huns, overran, the, alans, an, iranian, people, living, to, the, east, of, the, goths, and, then, along, with, alans, invaded, the, territory, of, the, goths, a, source, for, this, period, is, the, roman, historian, ammianus, marcellinus, who, wrote, that, hunnic, domination, of, the, gothic, kingdoms, in, scythia, began, in, the, 370s, it, is, possible, that, the, hunnic, attack, came, as, a, response, to, the, gothic, expansion, eastwards, upon, the, suicide, of, ermanaric, died, 376, the, greuthungi, gradually, fell, under, hunnic, domination, christopher, i, beckwith, suggests, that, the, hunnic, thrust, into, europe, and, the, roman, empire, was, an, attempt, to, subdue, the,

although, this, saga, might, derive, from, a, later, gothic, hunnic, conflict, although, the, huns, successfully, subdued, many, of, the, goths, who, subsequently, joined, their, ranks, fritigern, approached, the, eastern, roman, emperor, valens, in, 376, with, a, portion, of, his, people, and, asked, to, be, allowed, to, settle, on, the, south, bank, of, the, danube, valens, permitted, this, and, even, assisted, the, goths, in, their, crossing, of, the, river, probably, at, the, fortress, of, durostorum, the, gothic, evacuation, across, the, danube, was, probably, not, spontaneous, but, rather, a, carefully, planned, operation, initiated, after, long, debate, among, leading, members, of, the, community, upon, arrival, the, goths, were, to, be, disarmed, according, to, their, agreement, with, the, romans, although, many, of, them, still, managed, to, keep, their, arms, the, moesogoths, settled, in, thrace, and, moesia, mistreated, by, corrupt, local, roman, officials, the, gothic, refugees, were, soon, experiencing, a, famine, some, are, recorded, as, having, been, forced, to, sell, their, children, to, roman, slave, traders, in, return, for, rotten, dog, meat, enraged, by, this, treachery, fritigern, unleashed, a, widescale, rebellion, in, thrace, in, which, he, was, joined, not, only, by, gothic, refugees, and, slaves, but, also, by, disgruntled, roman, workers, and, peasants, and, gothic, deserters, from, the, roman, army, the, ensuing, conflict, known, as, the, gothic, war, lasted, for, several, years, meanwhile, a, group, of, greuthungi, led, by, the, chieftains, alatheus, and, saphrax, who, were, co, regents, with, vithericus, son, and, heir, of, the, greuthungi, king, vithimiris, crossed, the, danube, without, roman, permission, the, gothic, war, culminated, in, the, battle, of, adrianople, in, 378, in, which, the, romans, were, badly, defeated, and, valens, was, killed, following, the, decisive, gothic, victory, at, adrianople, julius, the, magister, militum, of, the, eastern, roman, empire, organized, a, wholesale, massacre, of, goths, in, asia, minor, syria, and, other, parts, of, the, roman, east, fearing, rebellion, julian, lured, the, goths, into, the, confines, of, urban, streets, from, which, they, could, not, escape, and, massacred, soldiers, and, civilians, alike, as, word, spread, the, goths, rioted, throughout, the, region, and, large, numbers, were, killed, survivors, may, have, settled, in, phrygia, with, the, rise, of, theodosius, i, in, 379, the, romans, launched, a, renewed, offensive, to, subdue, fritigern, and, his, followers, around, the, same, time, athanaric, arrived, in, constantinople, having, fled, caucaland, through, the, scheming, of, fritigern, athanaric, received, a, warm, reception, by, theodosius, praised, the, roman, emperor, in, return, and, was, honoured, with, a, magnificent, funeral, by, the, emperor, following, his, death, shortly, after, his, arrival, in, 382, theodosius, decided, to, enter, peace, negotiations, with, the, thervingi, which, were, concluded, on, 3, october, 382, the, thervingi, were, subsequently, made, foederati, of, the, romans, in, thrace, and, obliged, to, provide, troops, to, the, roman, army, in, the, aftermath, of, the, hunnic, onslaught, two, major, groups, of, the, goths, would, eventually, emerge, the, visigoths, and, ostrogoths, visigoths, means, the, goths, of, the, west, while, ostrogoths, means, goths, of, the, east, the, visigoths, led, by, the, balti, dynasty, claimed, descent, from, the, thervingi, and, lived, as, foederati, inside, roman, territory, while, the, ostrogoths, led, by, the, amali, dynasty, claimed, descent, from, the, greuthungi, and, were, subjects, of, the, huns, procopius, interpreted, the, name, visigoth, as, western, goths, and, the, name, ostrogoth, as, eastern, goth, reflecting, the, geographic, distribution, of, the, gothic, realms, at, that, time, a, people, closely, related, to, the, goths, the, gepids, were, also, living, under, hunnic, domination, a, smaller, group, of, goths, were, the, crimean, goths, who, remained, in, crimea, and, maintained, their, gothic, identity, well, into, the, middle, ages, the, visigoths, were, a, new, gothic, political, unit, brought, together, during, the, career, of, their, first, leader, alaric, i, following, a, major, settlement, of, goths, in, the, balkans, made, by, theodosius, in, 382, goths, received, prominent, positions, in, the, roman, army, relations, with, roman, civilians, were, sometimes, uneasy, in, 391, gothic, soldiers, with, the, blessing, of, theodosius, i, massacred, thousands, of, roman, spectators, at, the, hippodrome, in, thessalonica, as, vengeance, for, the, lynching, of, the, gothic, general, butheric, the, goths, suffered, heavy, losses, while, serving, theodosius, in, the, civil, war, of, 394, against, eugenius, and, arbogast, in, 395, following, the, death, of, theodosius, i, alaric, and, his, balkan, goths, invaded, greece, where, they, sacked, piraeus, the, port, of, athens, and, destroyed, corinth, megara, argos, and, sparta, athens, itself, was, spared, by, paying, a, large, bribe, and, the, eastern, emperor, flavius, arcadius, subsequently, appointed, alaric, magister, militum, master, of, the, soldiers, in, illyricum, in, 397, in, 401, and, 402, alaric, made, two, attempts, at, invading, italy, but, was, defeated, by, stilicho, in, 405, 406, another, gothic, leader, radagaisus, also, attempted, to, invade, italy, and, was, also, defeated, by, stilicho, in, 408, the, western, roman, emperor, flavius, honorius, ordered, the, execution, of, stilicho, and, his, family, then, incited, the, roman, population, to, massacre, tens, of, thousands, of, wives, and, children, of, goths, serving, in, the, roman, military, subsequently, around, 30, 000, gothic, soldiers, defected, to, alaric, alaric, in, turn, invaded, italy, seeking, to, pressure, honorious, into, granting, him, permission, to, settle, his, people, in, north, africa, in, italy, alaric, liberated, tens, of, thousands, of, gothic, slaves, and, in, 410, he, sacked, the, city, of, rome, although, the, city, s, riches, were, plundered, the, civilian, inhabitants, of, the, city, were, treated, humanely, and, only, a, few, buildings, were, burned, alaric, died, soon, afterwards, and, was, buried, along, with, his, treasure, in, an, unknown, grave, under, the, busento, river, alaric, was, succeeded, by, his, brother, in, law, athaulf, husband, of, honorius, sister, galla, placidia, who, had, been, seized, during, alaric, s, sack, of, rome, athaulf, settled, the, visigoths, in, southern, gaul, after, failing, to, gain, recognition, from, the, romans, athaulf, retreated, into, hispania, in, early, 415, and, was, assassinated, in, barcelona, shortly, afterwards, he, was, succeeded, by, sigeric, and, then, wallia, who, succeeded, in, having, the, visigoths, accepted, by, honorius, as, foederati, in, southern, gaul, with, their, capital, at, toulouse, wallia, subsequently, inflicted, severe, defeats, upon, the, silingi, vandals, and, the, alans, in, hispania, wallia, was, succeeded, by, theodoric, i, who, completed, the, settlement, of, the, goths, in, aquitania, periodically, they, marched, on, arles, the, seat, of, the, praetorian, prefect, but, were, always, pushed, back, in, 439, the, visigoths, signed, a, treaty, with, the, romans, which, they, kept, under, theodoric, ii, the, visigoths, allied, with, the, romans, and, fought, attila, to, a, stalemate, in, the, battle, of, the, catalaunian, fields, although, theodoric, was, killed, in, the, battle, under, euric, the, visigoths, established, an, independent, visigothic, kingdom, and, succeeded, in, driving, the, suebi, out, of, hispania, proper, and, back, into, galicia, although, they, controlled, spain, they, still, formed, a, tiny, minority, among, a, much, larger, hispano, roman, population, approximately, 200, 000, out, of, 6, 000, 000, in, 507, the, visigoths, were, pushed, out, of, most, of, gaul, by, the, frankish, king, clovis, i, at, the, battle, of, vouill, they, were, able, to, retain, narbonensis, and, provence, after, the, timely, arrival, of, an, ostrogoth, detachment, sent, by, theodoric, the, great, the, defeat, at, vouill, resulted, in, their, penetrating, further, into, hispania, and, establishing, a, new, capital, at, toledo, under, liuvigild, in, the, latter, part, of, the, 6th, century, the, visigoths, succeeded, in, subduing, the, suebi, in, galicia, and, the, byzantines, in, the, south, west, and, thus, achieved, dominance, over, most, of, the, iberian, peninsula, liuvigild, also, abolished, the, law, that, prevented, intermarriage, between, hispano, romans, and, goths, and, he, remained, an, arian, christian, the, conversion, of, reccared, i, to, roman, catholicism, in, the, late, 6th, century, prompted, the, assimilation, of, goths, with, the, hispano, romans, at, the, end, of, the, 7th, century, the, visigothic, kingdom, began, to, suffer, from, internal, troubles, their, kingdom, fell, and, was, progressively, conquered, by, the, umayyad, caliphate, from, 711, after, the, defeat, of, their, last, king, roderic, at, the, battle, of, guadalete, some, visigothic, nobles, found, refuge, in, the, mountain, areas, of, the, asturias, pyrenees, and, cantabria, according, to, joseph, f, o, callaghan, the, remnants, of, the, hispano, gothic, aristocracy, still, played, an, important, role, in, the, society, of, hispania, at, the, end, of, visigothic, rule, the, assimilation, of, hispano, romans, and, visigoths, was, occurring, at, a, fast, pace, their, nobility, had, begun, to, think, of, themselves, as, constituting, one, people, the, gens, gothorum, or, the, hispani, an, unknown, number, of, them, fled, and, took, refuge, in, asturias, or, septimania, in, asturias, they, supported, pelagius, s, uprising, and, joining, with, the, indigenous, leaders, formed, a, new, aristocracy, the, population, of, the, mountain, region, consisted, of, native, astures, galicians, cantabri, basques, and, other, groups, unassimilated, into, hispano, gothic, society, the, christians, began, to, regain, control, under, the, leadership, of, the, nobleman, pelagius, of, asturias, who, founded, the, kingdom, of, asturias, in, 718, and, defeated, the, muslims, at, the, battle, of, covadonga, in, c, 722, in, what, is, taken, by, historians, to, be, the, beginning, of, the, reconquista, it, was, from, the, asturian, kingdom, that, modern, spain, and, portugal, evolved, the, visigoths, were, never, completely, romanized, rather, they, were, hispanicized, as, they, spread, widely, over, a, large, territory, and, population, they, progressively, adopted, a, new, culture, retaining, little, of, their, original, culture, except, for, practical, military, customs, some, artistic, modalities, family, traditions, such, as, heroic, songs, and, folklore, as, well, as, select, conventions, to, include, germanic, names, still, in, use, in, present, day, spain, it, is, these, artifacts, of, the, original, visigothic, culture, that, give, ample, evidence, of, its, contributing, foundation, for, the, present, regional, culture, portraying, themselves, heirs, of, the, visigoths, the, subsequent, christian, spanish, monarchs, declared, their, responsibility, for, the, reconquista, of, muslim, spain, which, was, completed, with, the, fall, of, granada, in, 1492, after, the, hunnic, invasion, many, goths, became, subjects, of, the, huns, a, section, of, these, goths, under, the, leadership, of, the, amali, dynasty, came, to, be, known, as, the, ostrogoths, others, sought, refuge, in, the, roman, empire, where, many, of, them, were, recruited, into, the, roman, army, in, the, spring, of, 399, tribigild, a, gothic, leader, in, charge, of, troops, in, nakoleia, rose, up, in, rebellion, and, defeated, the, first, imperial, army, sent, against, him, possibly, seeking, to, emulate, alaric, s, successes, in, the, west, gainas, a, goth, who, along, with, stilicho, and, eutropius, had, deposed, rufinus, in, 395, was, sent, to, suppress, tribigild, s, rebellion, but, instead, plotted, to, use, the, situation, to, seize, power, in, the, eastern, roman, empire, this, attempt, was, however, thwarted, by, the, pro, roman, goth, fravitta, and, in, the, aftermath, thousands, of, gothic, civilians, were, massacred, in, constantinople, many, being, burned, alive, in, the, local, arian, church, where, they, had, taken, shelter, as, late, as, the, 6th, century, goths, were, settled, as, foederati, in, parts, of, asia, minor, their, descendants, who, formed, the, elite,

of, the, huns, at, the, battle, of, nedao, in, 454, the, ostrogoths, broke, away, from, hunnic, rule, under, their, king, valamir, mentions, of, this, event, were, probably, preserved, in, slavic, epic, songs, under, his, successor, theodemir, they, utterly, defeated, the, huns, at, the, bassianae, in, 468, and, then, defeated, a, coalition, of, roman, supported, germanic, tribes, at, the, battle, of, bolia, in, 469, which, gained, them, supremacy, in, pannonia, theodemir, was, succeeded, by, his, son, theodoric, in, 471, who, was, forced, to, compete, with, theodoric, strabo, leader, of, the, thracian, goths, for, the, leadership, of, his, people, fearing, the, threat, posed, by, theodoric, to, constantinople, the, eastern, roman, emperor, zeno, ordered, theodoric, to, invade, italy, in, 488, by, 493, theodoric, had, conquered, all, of, italy, from, the, scirian, odoacer, whom, he, killed, with, his, own, hands, he, subsequently, formed, the, ostrogothic, kingdom, theodoric, settled, his, entire, people, in, italy, estimated, at, 100, 000, 200, 000, mostly, in, the, northern, part, of, the, country, and, ruled, the, country, very, efficiently, the, goths, in,

nevertheless, the, roman, majority, was, treated, fairly, the, goths, were, briefly, reunited, under, one, crown, in, the, early, 6th, century, under, theodoric, who, became, regent, of, the, visigothic, kingdom, following, the, death, of, alaric, ii, at, the, battle, of, vouill, in, 507, shortly, after, theodoric, s, death, the, country, was, invaded, by, the, eastern, roman, empire, in, the, gothic, war, which, severely, devastated, and, depopulated, the, italian, peninsula, the, ostrogoths, made, a, brief, resurgence, under, their, king, totila, who, was, however, killed, at, the, battle, of, taginae, in, 552, after, the, last, stand, of, the, ostrogothic, king, teia, at, the, battle, of, mons, lactarius, in, 553, ostrogothic, resistance, ended, and, the, remaining, goths, in, italy, were, assimilated, by, the, lombards, another, germanic, tribe, who, invaded, italy, and, founded, the, kingdom, of, the, lombards, in, 567, gothic, tribes, who, remained, in, the, lands, around, the, black, sea, especially, in, crimea, were, known, as, the, crimean, goths, during, the, late, 5th, and, early, 6th, century, the, crimean, goths, had, to, fend, off, hordes, of, huns, who, were, migrating, back, eastward, after, losing, control, of, their, european, empire, in, the, 5th, century, theodoric, the, great, tried, to, recruit, crimean, goths, for, his, campaigns, in, italy, but, few, showed, interest, in, joining, him, they, affiliated, with, the, eastern, orthodox, church, through, the, metropolitanate, of, gothia, and, were, then, closely, associated, with, the, byzantine, empire, during, the, middle, ages, the, crimean, goths, were, in, perpetual, conflict, with, the, khazars, john, of, gothia, the, metropolitan, bishop, of, doros, capital, of, the, crimean, goths, briefly, expelled, the, khazars, from, crimea, in, the, late, 8th, century, and, was, subsequently, canonized, as, an, eastern, orthodox, saint, in, the, 10th, century, the, lands, of, the, crimean, goths, were, once, again, raided, by, the, khazars, as, a, response, the, leaders, of, the, crimean, goths, made, an, alliance, with, sviatoslav, i, of, kiev, who, subsequently, waged, war, upon, and, utterly, destroyed, the, khazar, khaganate, in, the, late, middle, ages, the, crimean, goths, were, part, of, the, principality, of, theodoro, which, was, conquered, by, the, ottoman, empire, in, the, late, 15th, century, as, late, as, the, 18th, century, a, small, number, of, people, in, crimea, may, still, have, spoken, crimean, gothic, the, goths, were, germanic, speaking, the, gothic, language, is, the, germanic, language, with, the, earliest, attestation, the, 4th, century, and, the, only, east, germanic, language, documented, in, more, than, proper, names, short, phrases,

the, military, victory, of, the, franks, the, elimination, of, the, goths, in, italy, and, geographic, isolation, in, spain, the, language, lost, its, last, and, probably, already, declining, function, as, a, church, language, when, the, visigoths, converted, to, catholicism, in, 589, it, survived, as, a, domestic, language, in, the, iberian, peninsula, modern, spain, and, portugal, as, late, as, the, 8th, century, frankish, author, walafrid, strabo, wrote, that, gothic, was, still, spoken, in, the, lower, danube, area, in, what, is, now, bulgaria, in, the, early, 9th, century, and, a, related, dialect, known, as, crimean, gothic, was, spoken, in, the, crimea, until, the, 16th, century, according, to, references, in, the, writings, of, travelers, most, modern, scholars, believe,

a, quarter, to, a, fifth, of, weapon, bearing, gothic, males, of, the, ostrogothic, kingdom, were, freemen, initially, practising, gothic, paganism, the, goths, were, gradually, converted, to,

the, goths, and, was, martyred, it, was, only, in, the, 4th, century, as, a, result, of, missionary, activity, by, the, gothic, bishop, ulfilas, whose, grandparents, were, cappadocians, taken, captive, in, the, raids, of, the, 250s, that, the, goths, were, gradually, converted, ulfilas, devised, a, gothic, alphabet, and, translated, the, gothic, bible, during, the, 370s, goths, converting,

and, short, wooden, bows, specialized, javelins, such, as, angon, were, more, rare, but, still, used, archaeology, shows, that, the, visigoths, unlike, the, ostrogoths, were, predominantly, farmers, they, sowed, wheat, barley, rye, and, flax, they, also, raised, pigs, poultry, and, goats, horses, and, donkeys, were, raised, as, working, animals, and, fed, with, hay, sheep, were, raised, for, their, wool, which, they, fashioned, into, clothing, archaeology, indicates, they, were, skilled, potters, and, blacksmiths, when, peace, treaties, were, negotiated, with, the, romans, the, goths,

that, region, have, but, one, desire, that, they, may, never, have, to, return, to, the, roman, jurisdiction, it, is, the, unanimous, prayer, of, the, roman, people, in, that, district, that, they,

are, the, only, remains, of, the, visigothic, cathedral, of, palencia, reccopolis, spanish, rec, polis, located, near, the, tiny, modern, village, of, zorita, de, los, canes, in, the, province, of, guadalajara, castile, la, mancha, spain, is, an, archaeological, site, of, one, of, at, least, four, cities, founded, in, hispania, by, the, visigoths, it, is, the, only, city, in, western, europe, to, have, been, founded, between, the, fifth, and, eighth, centuries, according, to, lauro, olmo, enciso, who, is, a, professor, of, archaeology, at, the, university, of, alcal, the, city, was, ordered, to, build, by, the, visigothic, king, leovigild, to, honor, his, son, reccared, i, and, to, serve, as, reccared, s, seat, as, co, king, in, the, visigothic, province, of, celtiberia, to, the, west, of, carpetania, where, the, main, capital, toledo, lay, in, ancient, sources, the, goths, are, always, described, as, tall, and, athletic, with, light, skin, blonde, hair, and, blue, eyes, the, 4th, century, greek, historian, eunapius, described, their, characteristic, powerful, musculature, in, a, pejorative, way, their, bodies, provoked, contempt, in, all, who, saw, them, for, they, were, far, too, big, and, far, too, heavy, for, their, feet, to, carry, them, and, they, were, pinched, in, at, the, waist, just, like, those, insects, aristotle, writes, of, procopius, notes, that, the, vandals, and, gepids, looked, similar, to, the, goths, and, on, this, basis, he, suggested, that, they, were, all, of, common, origin, of, the, goths, he, wrote, that, they, all, have, white, bodies, and, fair, hair, and, are, tall, and, handsome, to, look, upon, stolarek, et, al, 2023, and, antonio, et, al, 2022, both, sequenced, genomes, from, the, wielbark, culture, goths, stolarek, et, al, includes, samples, from, multiple, sites, all, over, the, territory, of, the, wielbark, culture, in, large, numbers, the, results, are, in, aligment, with, archaeological, and, historical, evidence, strongly, suggesting, that, the, wielbark, culture, formed, through, migration, from, southern, scandinavia, a, large, majority, of, the, wielbark, culture, samples, are, autosomally, scandinavian, like, and, carry, predominantly, scandinavian, y, dna, haplogroups, the, most, common, y, dna, haplogroup, among, the, wielbark, individuals, was, y, dna, haplogroup, i1, m253, characteristic, of, the, nordic, bronze, age, in, southern, scandinavia, in, which, it, was, found, at, a, very, high, frequency, and, from, where, it, first, expanded, among, the, wielbark, goths, substantial, subclade, diversity, is, seen, among, the, i1, carriers, suggesting, that, the, male, founders, of, the, culture, descended, from, clans, from, a, rather, widespread, area, in, scandinavia, assessing, the, population, movement, during, late, antiquity, a, 2023, study, on, the, roman, frontier, on, the, danube, concludes, that, goths, were, ethnically, diverse, confederations, a, number, samples, obtained, from, roman, sites, close, to, the, limes, such, as, viminacium, dated, to, the, 3th, century, or, later, were, shown, to, carry, admixture, from, central, north, european, and, pontic, kazakh, steppe, ancestries, in, addition, to, 42, 55, local, balkan, iron, age, related, ancestry, 7, out, of, 9, males, among, these, samples, belonged, to, haplogroups, associated, with, these, trans, frontier, ancestry, sources, i1, and, r1b, u106, north, european, z93, iron, age, steppe, many, of, these, samples, suggest, that, admixture, between, central, north, european, and, pontic, kazakh, steppe, ancestries, likely, occurred, beyond, the, frontier, prior, to, the, movement, into, the, roman, empire, perhaps, indicative, of, e, g, the, formation, of, diverse, confederations, under, gothic, leadership, the, goths, relationship, with, sweden, became, an, important, part, of, swedish, nationalism, and, until, the, 19th, century, before, the, gothic, origin, had, been, thoroughly, researched, by, archaeologists, swedish, scholars, considered, swedes, to, be, the, direct, descendants, of, the, goths, today, scholars, identify, this, as, a, cultural, movement, called, gothicismus, which, included, an, enthusiasm, for, things, old, norse, in, medieval, and, modern, spain, the, visigoths, were, believed, to, be, the, progenitors, of, the, spanish, nobility, compare, gobineau, for, a, similar, french, idea, by, the, early, 7th, century, the, ethnic, distinction, between, visigoths, and, hispano, romans, had, all, but, disappeared, but, recognition, of, a, gothic, origin, e, g, on, gravestones, still, survived, among, the, nobility, the, 7th, century, visigothic, aristocracy, saw, itself, as, bearers, of, a, particular, gothic, consciousness, and, as, guardians, of, old, traditions, such, as, germanic, namegiving, probably, these, traditions, were, on, the, whole, restricted, to, the, family, sphere, hispano, roman, nobles, were, doing, service, for, the, visigothic, royal, court, in, toulouse, already, in, the, 5th, century, and, the, two, branches, of, spanish, aristocracy, had, fully, adopted, similar, customs, two, centuries, later, beginning, in, 1278, when, magnus, iii, of, sweden, ascended, to, the, throne, a, reference, to, gothic, origins, was, included, in, the, title, of, the, king, of, sweden, we, n, n, by, the, grace, of, god, king, of, the, swedes, the, goths, and, the, vends, in, 1973, with, the, accession, of, king, carl, xvi, gustaf, the, title, was, changed, to, simply, king, of, sweden, in, all, history, there, is, nothing, more, romantically, marvellous, than, the, swift, rise, of, this, people, to, the, height, of, greatness, or, than, the, suddenness, and, the, tragic, completeness, of, their, ruin, henry, bradley, the, story, of, the, goths, 1888, the, spanish, and, swedish, claims, of, gothic, origins, led, to, a, clash, at, the, council, of, basel, in, 1434, before, the, assembled, cardinals, and, delegations, could, engage, in, theological, discussion, they, had, to, decide, how, to, sit, during, the, proceedings, the, delegations, from, the, more, prominent, nations, argued, that, they, should, sit, closest, to, the, pope, and, there, were, also, disputes, over, who, were, to, have, the, finest, chairs, and, who, were, to, have, their, chairs, on, mats, in, some, cases, they, compromised, so, that, some, would, have, half, a, chair, leg, on, the, rim, of, a, mat, in, this, conflict, nicolaus, ragvaldi, bishop, of, the, diocese, of, v, xj, claimed, that, the, swedes, were, the, descendants, of, the, great, goths, and, that, the, people, of, v, sterg, tland, westrogothia, in, latin, were, the, visigoths, and, the, people, of, sterg, tland, ostrogothia, in, latin, were, the, ostrogoths, the, spanish, delegation, retorted, that, it, was, only, the, lazy, and, unenterprising, goths, who, had, remained, in, sweden, whereas, the, heroic, goths, had, left, sweden, invaded, the, roman, empire, and, settled, in, spain, in, spain, a, man, acting, with, arrogance, would, be, said, to, be, haci, ndose, los, godos, making, himself, to, act, like, the, goths, in, chile, argentina, and, the, canary, islands, godo, was, an, ethnic, slur, used, against, european, spaniards, who, in, the, early, colonial, period, often, felt, superior, to, the, people, born, locally, criollos, in, colombia, it, remains, as, slang, for, a, person, with, conservative, views, a, large, amount, of, literature, has, been, produced, on, the, goths, with, henry, bradley, s, the, goths, 1888, being, the, standard, english, language, text, for, many, decades, more, recently, peter, heather, has, established, himself, as, the, leading, authority, on, the, goths, in, the, english, speaking, world, the, leading, authority, on, the, goths, in, the, german, speaking, world, is, herwig, wolfram
