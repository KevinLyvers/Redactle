mesopotamia, is, a, historical, region, of, west, asia, situated, within, the, tigris, euphrates, river, system, in, the, northern, part, of, the, fertile, crescent, today, mesopotamia, is, known, as, present, day, iraq, in, the, broader, sense, the, historical, region, of, mesopotamia, also, includes, parts, of, present, day, iran, turkey, syria, and, kuwait, mesopotamia, is, the, site, of, the, earliest, developments, of, the, neolithic, revolution, from, around, 10, 000, bc, it, has, been, identified, as, having, inspired, some, of, the, most, important, developments, in, human, history, including, the, invention, of, the, wheel, the, planting, of, the, first, cereal, crops, and, the, development, of, cursive, script, mathematics, astronomy, and, agriculture, it, is, recognised, as, the, cradle, of, some, of, the, world, s, earliest, civilizations, the, sumerians, and, akkadians, each, originating, from, different, areas, dominated, mesopotamia, from, the, beginning, of, recorded, history, c, 3100, bc, to, the, fall, of, babylon, in, 539, bc, the, rise, of, empires, beginning, with, sargon, of, akkad, around, 2350, bc, characterized, the, subsequent, 2, 000, years, of, mesopotamian, history, marked, by, the, succession, of, kingdoms, and, empires, such, as, the, akkadian, empire, the, early, second, millennium, bc, saw, the, polarization, of, mesopotamian, society, into, assyria, in, the, north, and, babylonia, in, the, south, from, 900, to, 612, bc, the, neo, assyrian, empire, asserted, control, over, much, of, the, ancient, near, east, subsequently, the, babylonians, who, had, long, been, overshadowed, by, assyria, seized, power, dominating, the, region, for, a, century, as, the, final, independent, mesopotamian, realm, until, the, modern, era, in, 539, bc, mesopotamia, was, conquered, by, the, achaemenid, empire, the, area, was, next, conquered, by, alexander, the, great, in, 332, bc, after, his, death, it, became, part, of, the, greek, seleucid, empire, around, 150, bc, mesopotamia, was, under, the, control, of, the, parthian, empire, it, became, a, battleground, between, the, romans, and, parthians, with, western, parts, of, the, region, coming, under, ephemeral, roman, control, in, 226, ad, the, eastern, regions, of, mesopotamia, fell, to, the, sassanid, persians, the, division, of, the, region, between, the, roman, byzantine, empire, from, 395, ad, and, the, sassanid, empire, lasted, until, the, 7th, century, muslim, conquest, of, persia, of, the, sasanian, empire, and, the, muslim, conquest, of, the, levant, from, the, byzantines, a, number, of, primarily, neo, assyrian, and, christian, native, mesopotamian, states, existed, between, the, 1st, century, bc, and, 3rd, century, ad, including, adiabene, osroene, and, hatra, the, regional, toponym, mesopotamia, m, s, p, t, e, m, i, ancient, greek, between, rivers, arabic, bil, d, ar, r, fidayn, or, bayn, an, nahrayn, persian, miy, n, rud, n, syriac, beth, nahrain, land, between, the, two, rivers, comes, from, the, ancient, greek, root, words, mesos, middle, and, potamos, river, and, translates, to, land, between, rivers, likely, being, a, calque, of, the, older, aramaic, term, with, the, aramaic, term, itself, likely, being, a, calque, of, the, akkadian, birit, narim, it, is, used, throughout, the, greek, septuagint, c, 250, bc, to, translate, the, hebrew, and, aramaic, equivalent, naharaim, an, even, earlier, greek, usage, of, the, name, mesopotamia, is, evident, from, the, anabasis, of, alexander, which, was, written, in, the, late, 2nd, century, ad, but, specifically, refers, to, sources, from, the, time, of, alexander, the, great, in, the, anabasis, mesopotamia, was, used, to, designate, the, land, east, of, the, euphrates, in, north, syria, the, akkadian, term, biritum, birit, narim, corresponded, to, a, similar, geographical, concept, later, the, term, mesopotamia, was, more, generally, applied, to, all, the, lands, between, the, euphrates, and, the, tigris, thereby, incorporating, not, only, parts, of, syria, but, also, almost, all, of, iraq, and, southeastern, turkey, the, neighbouring, steppes, to, the, west, of, the, euphrates, and, the, western, part, of, the, zagros, mountains, are, also, often, included, under, the, wider, term, mesopotamia, a, further, distinction, is, usually, made, between, northern, or, upper, mesopotamia, and, southern, or, lower, mesopotamia, upper, mesopotamia, also, known, as, the, jazira, is, the, area, between, the, euphrates, and, the, tigris, from, their, sources, down, to, baghdad, lower, mesopotamia, is, the, area, from, baghdad, to, the, persian, gulf, and, includes, kuwait, and, parts, of, western, iran, in, modern, academic, usage, the, term, mesopotamia, often, also, has, a, chronological, connotation, it, is, usually, used, to, designate, the, area, until, the, muslim, conquests, with, names, like, syria, jazira, and, iraq, being, used, to, describe, the, region, after, that, date, it, has, been, argued, that, these, later, euphemisms, are, eurocentric, terms, attributed, to, the, region, in, the, midst, of, various, 19th, century, western, encroachments, mesopotamia, encompasses, the, land, between, the, euphrates, and, tigris, rivers, both, of, which, have, their, headwaters, in, the, neighboring, armenian, highlands, both, rivers, are, fed, by, numerous, tributaries, and, the, entire, river, system, drains, a, vast, mountainous, region, overland, routes, in, mesopotamia, usually, follow, the, euphrates, because, the, banks, of, the, tigris, are, frequently, steep, and, difficult, the, climate, of, the, region, is, semi, arid, with, a, vast, desert, expanse, in, the, north, which, gives, way, to, a, 15, 000, square, kilometre, 5, 800, sq, mi, region, of, marshes, lagoons, mudflats, and, reed, banks, in, the, south, in, the, extreme, south, the, euphrates, and, the, tigris, unite, and, empty, into, the, persian, gulf, the, arid, environment, ranges, from, the, northern, areas, of, rain, fed, agriculture, to, the, south, where, irrigation, of, agriculture, is, essential, this, irrigation, is, aided, by, a, high, water, table, and, by, melting, snows, from, the, high, peaks, of, the, northern, zagros, mountains, and, from, the, armenian, highlands, the, source, of, the, tigris, and, euphrates, rivers, that, give, the, region, its, name, the, usefulness, of, irrigation, depends, upon, the, ability, to, mobilize, sufficient, labor, for, the, construction, and, maintenance, of, canals, and, this, from, the, earliest, period, has, assisted, the, development, of, urban, settlements, and, centralized, systems, of, political, authority, agriculture, throughout, the, region, has, been, supplemented, by, nomadic, pastoralism, where, tent, dwelling, nomads, herded, sheep, and, goats, and, later, camels, from, the, river, pastures, in, the, dry, summer, months, out, into, seasonal, grazing, lands, on, the, desert, fringe, in, the, wet, winter, season, the, area, is, generally, lacking, in, building, stone, precious, metals, and, timber, and, so, historically, has, relied, upon, long, distance, trade, of, agricultural, products, to, secure, these, items, from, outlying, areas, in, the, marshlands, to, the, south, of, the, area, a, complex, water, borne, fishing, culture, has, existed, since, prehistoric, times, and, has, added, to, the, cultural, mix, periodic, breakdowns, in, the, cultural, system, have, occurred, for, a, number, of, reasons, the, demands, for, labor, has, from, time, to, time, led, to, population, increases, that, push, the, limits, of, the, ecological, carrying, capacity, and, should, a, period, of, climatic, instability, ensue, collapsing, central, government, and, declining, populations, can, occur, alternatively, military, vulnerability, to, invasion, from, marginal, hill, tribes, or, nomadic, pastoralists, has, led, to, periods, of, trade, collapse, and, neglect, of, irrigation, systems, equally, centripetal, tendencies, amongst, city, states, have, meant, that, central, authority, over, the, whole, region, when, imposed, has, tended, to, be, ephemeral, and, localism, has, fragmented, power, into, tribal, or, smaller, regional, units, these, trends, have, continued, to, the, present, day, in, iraq, the, prehistory, of, the, ancient, near, east, begins, in, the, lower, paleolithic, period, therein, writing, emerged, with, a, pictographic, script, proto, cuneiform, in, the, uruk, iv, period, c, late, 4th, millennium, bc, the, documented, record, of, actual, historical, events, and, the, ancient, history, of, lower, mesopotamia, commenced, in, the, early, third, millennium, bc, with, cuneiform, records, of, early, dynastic, kings, this, entire, history, ends, with, either, the, arrival, of, the, achaemenid, empire, in, the, late, 6th, century, bc, or, with, the, muslim, conquest, and, the, establishment, of, the, caliphate, in, the, late, 7th, century, ad, from, which, point, the, region, came, to, be, known, as, iraq, in, the, long, span, of, this, period, mesopotamia, housed, some, of, the, world, s, most, ancient, highly, developed, and, socially, complex, states, the, region, was, one, of, the, four, riverine, civilizations, where, writing, was, invented, along, with, the, nile, valley, in, ancient, egypt, the, indus, valley, civilization, in, the, indian, subcontinent, and, the, yellow, river, in, ancient, china, mesopotamia, housed, historically, important, cities, such, as, uruk, nippur, nineveh, assur, and, babylon, as, well, as, major, territorial, states, such, as, the, city, of, eridu, the, akkadian, kingdoms, the, third, dynasty, of, ur, and, the, various, assyrian, empires, some, of, the, important, historical, mesopotamian, leaders, were, ur, nammu, king, of, ur, sargon, of, akkad, who, established, the, akkadian, empire, hammurabi, who, established, the, old, babylonian, state, ashur, uballit, i, and, tiglath, pileser, i, who, established, the, assyrian, empire, scientists, analysed, dna, from, the, 8, 000, year, old, remains, of, early, farmers, found, at, an, ancient, graveyard, in, germany, they, compared, the, genetic, signatures, to, those, of, modern, populations, and, found, similarities, with, the, dna, of, people, living, in, today, s, turkey, and, iraq, the, earliest, language, written, in, mesopotamia, was, sumerian, an, agglutinative, language, isolate, along, with, sumerian, semitic, languages, were, also, spoken, in, early, mesopotamia, subartuan, a, language, of, the, zagros, possibly, related, to, the, hurro, urartuan, language, family, is, attested, in, personal, names, rivers, and, mountains, and, in, various, crafts, akkadian, came, to, be, the, dominant, language, during, the, akkadian, empire, and, the, assyrian, empires, but, sumerian, was, retained, for, administrative, religious, literary, and, scientific, purposes, different, varieties, of, akkadian, were, used, until, the, end, of, the, neo, babylonian, period, old, aramaic, which, had, already, become, common, in, mesopotamia, then, became, the, official, provincial, administration, language, of, first, the, neo, assyrian, empire, and, then, the, achaemenid, empire, the, official, lect, is, called, imperial, aramaic, akkadian, fell, into, disuse, but, both, it, and, sumerian, were, still, used, in, temples, for, some, centuries, the, last, akkadian, texts, date, from, the, late, 1st, century, ad, early, in, mesopotamia, s, history, around, the, mid, 4th, millennium, bc, cuneiform, was, invented, for, the, sumerian, language, cuneiform, literally, means, wedge, shaped, due, to, the, triangular, tip, of, the, stylus, used, for, impressing, signs, on, wet, clay, the, standardized, form, of, each, cuneiform, sign, appears, to, have, been, developed, from, pictograms, the, earliest, texts, 7, archaic, tablets, come, from, the, a, temple, dedicated, to, the, goddess, inanna, at, uruk, from, a, building, labeled, as, temple, c, by, its, excavators, the, early, logographic, system, of, cuneiform, script, took, many, years, to, master, thus, only, a, limited, number, of, individuals, were, hired, as, scribes, to, be, trained, in, its, use, it, was, not, until, the, widespread, use, of, a, syllabic, script, was, adopted, under, sargon, s, rule, that, significant, portions, of, the, mesopotamian, population, became, literate, massive, archives, of, texts, were, recovered, from, the, archaeological, contexts, of, old, babylonian, scribal, schools, through, which, literacy, was, disseminated, akkadian, gradually, replaced, sumerian, as, the, spoken, language, of, mesopotamia, somewhere, around, the, turn, of, the, 3rd, and, the, 2nd, millennium, bc, the, exact, dating, being, a, matter, of, debate, sumerian, continued, to, be, used, as, a, sacred, ceremonial, literary, and, scientific, language, in, mesopotamia, until, the, 1st, century, ad, libraries, were, extant, in, towns, and, temples, during, the, babylonian, empire, an, old, sumerian, proverb, averred, that, he, who, would, excel, in, the, school, of, the, scribes, must, rise, with, the, dawn, women, as, well, as, men, learned, to, read, and, write, and, for, the, semitic, babylonians, this, involved, knowledge, of, the, extinct, sumerian, language, and, a, complicated, and, extensive, syllabary, a, considerable, amount, of, babylonian, literature, was, translated, from, sumerian, originals, and, the, language, of, religion, and, law, long, continued, to, be, the, old, agglutinative, language, of, sumer, vocabularies, grammars, and, interlinear, translations, were, compiled, for, the, use, of, students, as, well, as, commentaries, on, the, older, texts, and, explanations, of, obscure, words, and, phrases, the, characters, of, the, syllabary, were, all, arranged, and, named, and, elaborate, lists, were, drawn, up, many, babylonian, literary, works, are, still, studied, today, one, of, the, most, famous, of, these, was, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, in, twelve, books, translated, from, the, original, sumerian, by, a, certain, s, n, l, qi, unninni, and, arranged, upon, an, astronomical, principle, each, division, contains, the, story, of, a, single, adventure, in, the, career, of, gilgamesh, the, whole, story, is, a, composite, product, although, it, is, probable, that, some, of, the, stories, are, artificially, attached, to, the, central, figure, mesopotamian, mathematics, and, science, was, based, on, a, sexagesimal, base, 60, numeral, system, this, is, the, source, of, the, 60, minute, hour, the, 24, hour, day, and, the, 360, degree, circle, the, sumerian, calendar, was, lunisolar, with, three, seven, day, weeks, of, a, lunar, month, this, form, of, mathematics, was, instrumental, in, early, map, making, the, babylonians, also, had, theorems, on, how, to, measure, the, area, of, several, shapes, and, solids, they, measured, the, circumference, of, a, circle, as, three, times, the, diameter, and, the, area, as, one, twelfth, the, square, of, the, circumference, which, would, be, correct, if, were, fixed, at, 3, the, volume, of, a, cylinder, was, taken, as, the, product, of, the, area, of, the, base, and, the, height, however, the, volume, of, the, frustum, of, a, cone, or, a, square, pyramid, was, incorrectly, taken, as, the, product, of, the, height, and, half, the, sum, of, the, bases, also, there, was, a, recent, discovery, in, which, a, tablet, used, as, 25, 8, 3, 125, instead, of, 3, 14159, the, babylonians, are, also, known, for, the, babylonian, mile, which, was, a, measure, of, distance, equal, to, about, seven, modern, miles, 11, km, this, measurement, for, distances, eventually, was, converted, to, a, time, mile, used, for, measuring, the, travel, of, the, sun, therefore, representing, time, the, roots, of, algebra, can, be, traced, to, the, ancient, babylonia, who, developed, an, advanced, arithmetical, system, with, which, they, were, able, to, do, calculations, in, an, algorithmic, fashion, the, babylonian, clay, tablet, ybc, 7289, c, 1800, 1600, bc, gives, an, approximation, of, 2, in, four, sexagesimal, figures, 1, 24, 51, 10, which, is, accurate, to, about, six, decimal, digits, and, is, the, closest, possible, three, place, sexagesimal, representation, of, 2, the, babylonians, were, not, interested, in, exact, solutions, but, rather, approximations, and, so, they, would, commonly, use, linear, interpolation, to, approximate, intermediate, values, one, of, the, most, famous, tablets, is, the, plimpton, 322, tablet, created, around, 1900, 1600, bc, which, gives, a, table, of, pythagorean, triples, and, represents, some, of, the, most, advanced, mathematics, prior, to, greek, mathematics, from, sumerian, times, temple, priesthoods, had, attempted, to, associate, current, events, with, certain, positions, of, the, planets, and, stars, this, continued, to, assyrian, times, when, limmu, lists, were, created, as, a, year, by, year, association, of, events, with, planetary, positions, which, when, they, have, survived, to, the, present, day, allow, accurate, associations, of, relative, with, absolute, dating, for, establishing, the, history, of, mesopotamia, the, babylonian, astronomers, were, very, adept, at, mathematics, and, could, predict, eclipses, and, solstices, scholars, thought, that, everything, had, some, purpose, in, astronomy, most, of, these, related, to, religion, and, omens, mesopotamian, astronomers, worked, out, a, 12, month, calendar, based, on, the, cycles, of, the, moon, they, divided, the, year, into, two, seasons, summer, and, winter, the, origins, of, astronomy, as, well, as, astrology, date, from, this, time, during, the, 8th, and, 7th, centuries, bc, babylonian, astronomers, developed, a, new, approach, to, astronomy, they, began, studying, philosophy, dealing, with, the, ideal, nature, of, the, early, universe, and, began, employing, an, internal, logic, within, their, predictive, planetary, systems, this, was, an, important, contribution, to, astronomy, and, the, philosophy, of, science, and, some, scholars, have, thus, referred, to, this, new, approach, as, the, first, scientific, revolution, this, new, approach, to, astronomy, was, adopted, and, further, developed, in, greek, and, hellenistic, astronomy, in, seleucid, and, parthian, times, the, astronomical, reports, were, thoroughly, scientific, how, much, earlier, their, advanced, knowledge, and, methods, were, developed, is, uncertain, the, babylonian, development, of, methods, for, predicting, the, motions, of, the, planets, is, considered, to, be, a, major, episode, in, the, history, of, astronomy, the, only, greek, babylonian, astronomer, known, to, have, supported, a, heliocentric, model, of, planetary, motion, was, seleucus, of, seleucia, b, 190, bc, seleucus, is, known, from, the, writings, of, plutarch, he, supported, aristarchus, of, samos, heliocentric, theory, where, the, earth, rotated, around, its, own, axis, which, in, turn, revolved, around, the, sun, according, to, plutarch, seleucus, even, proved, the, heliocentric, system, but, it, is, not, known, what, arguments, he, used, except, that, he, correctly, theorized, on, tides, as, a, result, of, the, moon, s, attraction, babylonian, astronomy, served, as, the, basis, for, much, of, greek, classical, indian, sassanian, byzantine, syrian, medieval, islamic, central, asian, and, western, european, astronomy, the, oldest, babylonian, texts, on, medicine, date, back, to, the, old, babylonian, period, in, the, first, half, of, the, 2nd, millennium, bc, the, most, extensive, babylonian, medical, text, however, is, the, diagnostic, handbook, written, by, the, umm, n, or, chief, scholar, esagil, kin, apli, of, borsippa, during, the, reign, of, the, babylonian, king, adad, apla, iddina, 1069, 1046, bc, along, with, contemporary, egyptian, medicine, the, babylonians, introduced, the, concepts, of, diagnosis, prognosis, physical, examination, enemas, and, prescriptions, the, diagnostic, handbook, introduced, the, methods, of, therapy, and, aetiology, and, the, use, of, empiricism, logic, and, rationality, in, diagnosis, prognosis, and, therapy, the, text, contains, a, list, of, medical, symptoms, and, often, detailed, empirical, observations, along, with, logical, rules, used, in, combining, observed, symptoms, on, the, body, of, a, patient, with, its, diagnosis, and, prognosis, the, symptoms, and, diseases, of, a, patient, were, treated, through, therapeutic, means, such, as, bandages, creams, and, pills, if, a, patient, could, not, be, cured, physically, the, babylonian, physicians, often, relied, on, exorcism, to, cleanse, the, patient, from, any, curses, esagil, kin, apli, s, diagnostic, handbook, was, based, on, a, logical, set, of, axioms, and, assumptions, including, the, modern, view, that, through, the, examination, and, inspection, of, the, symptoms, of, a, patient, it, is, possible, to, determine, the, patient, s, disease, its, aetiology, its, future, development, and, the, chances, of, the, patient, s, recovery, esagil, kin, apli, discovered, a, variety, of, illnesses, and, diseases, and, described, their, symptoms, in, his, diagnostic, handbook, these, include, the, symptoms, for, many, varieties, of, epilepsy, and, related, ailments, along, with, their, diagnosis, and, prognosis, some, treatments, used, were, likely, based, off, the, known, characteristics, of, the, ingredients, used, the, others, were, based, on, the, symbolic, qualities, mesopotamian, people, invented, many, technologies, including, metal, and, copper, working, glass, and, lamp, making, textile, weaving, flood, control, water, storage, and, irrigation, they, were, also, one, of, the, first, bronze, age, societies, in, the, world, they, developed, from, copper, bronze, and, gold, on, to, iron, palaces, were, decorated, with, hundreds, of, kilograms, of, these, very, expensive, metals, also, copper, bronze, and, iron, were, used, for, armor, as, well, as, for, different, weapons, such, as, swords, daggers, spears, and, maces, according, to, a, recent, hypothesis, the, archimedes, screw, may, have, been, used, by, sennacherib, king, of, assyria, for, the, water, systems, at, the, hanging, gardens, of, babylon, and, nineveh, in, the, 7th, century, bc, although, mainstream, scholarship, holds, it, to, be, a, greek, invention, of, later, times, later, during, the, parthian, or, sasanian, periods, the, baghdad, battery, which, may, have, been, the, world, s, first, battery, was, created, in, mesopotamia, the, ancient, mesopotamian, religion, was, the, first, recorded, mesopotamians, believed, that, the, world, was, a, flat, disc, surrounded, by, a, huge, holed, space, and, above, that, heaven, they, believed, that, water, was, everywhere, the, top, bottom, and, sides, and, that, the, universe, was, born, from, this, enormous, sea, mesopotamian, religion, was, polytheistic, although, the, beliefs, described, above, were, held, in, common, among, mesopotamians, there, were, regional, variations, the, sumerian, word, for, universe, is, an, ki, which, refers, to, the, god, an, and, the, goddess, ki, their, son, was, enlil, the, air, god, they, believed, that, enlil, was, the, most, powerful, god, he, was, the, chief, god, of, the, pantheon, the, numerous, civilizations, of, the, area, influenced, the, abrahamic, religions, especially, the, hebrew, bible, its, cultural, values, and, literary, influence, are, especially, evident, in, the, book, of, genesis, giorgio, buccellati, believes, that, the, origins, of, philosophy, can, be, traced, back, to, early, mesopotamian, wisdom, which, embodied, certain, philosophies, of, life, particularly, ethics, in, the, forms, of, dialectic, dialogues, epic, poetry, folklore, hymns, lyrics, prose, works, and, proverbs, babylonian, reason, and, rationality, developed, beyond, empirical, observation, babylonian, thought, was, also, based, on, an, open, systems, ontology, which, is, compatible, with, ergodic, axioms, logic, was, employed, to, some, extent, in, babylonian, astronomy, and, medicine, babylonian, thought, had, a, considerable, influence, on, early, ancient, greek, and, hellenistic, philosophy, in, particular, the, babylonian, text, dialogue, of, pessimism, contains, similarities, to, the, agonistic, thought, of, the, sophists, the, heraclitean, doctrine, of, dialectic, and, the, dialogs, of, plato, as, well, as, a, precursor, to, the, socratic, method, the, ionian, philosopher, thales, was, influenced, by, babylonian, cosmological, ideas, ancient, mesopotamians, had, ceremonies, each, month, the, theme, of, the, rituals, and, festivals, for, each, month, was, determined, by, at, least, six, important, factors, some, songs, were, written, for, the, gods, but, many, were, written, to, describe, important, events, although, music, and, songs, amused, kings, they, were, also, enjoyed, by, ordinary, people, who, liked, to, sing, and, dance, in, their, homes, or, in, the, marketplaces, songs, were, sung, to, children, who, passed, them, on, to, their, children, thus, songs, were, passed, on, through, many, generations, as, an, oral, tradition, until, writing, was, more, universal, these, songs, provided, a, means, of, passing, on, through, the, centuries, highly, important,

mesopotamia, as, shown, by, successive, law, codes, those, of, urukagina, lipit, ishtar, and, hammurabi, across, its, history, became, more, and, more, a, patriarchal, society, one, in, which, the, men, were, far, more, powerful, than, the, women, for, example, during, the, earliest, sumerian, period, the, en, or, high, priest, of, male, gods, was, originally, a, woman, that, of, female, goddesses, thorkild, jacobsen, as, well, as, others, have, suggested, that, early, mesopotamian, society, was, ruled, by, a, council, of, elders, in, which, men, and, women, were, equally, represented, but, that, over, time, as, the, status, of, women, fell, that, of, men, increased, as, for, schooling, only, royal, offspring, and, sons, of, the, rich, and, professionals, such, as,

their, mothers, to, learn, housekeeping, and, cooking, and, to, look, after, the, younger, children, some, children, would, help, with, crushing, grain, or, cleaning, birds, unusually, for, that, time, in, history, women, in, mesopotamia, had, rights, they, could, own, property, and, if, they, had, good, reason, get, a, divorce, 78, 79, hundreds, of, graves, have, been, excavated, in, parts, of, mesopotamia, revealing, information, about, mesopotamian, burial, habits, in, the, city, of, ur, most, people, were, buried, in, family, graves, under, their, houses, along, with, some, possessions, a, few, have, been, found, wrapped, in, mats, and, carpets, deceased, children, were, put, in, big, jars, which, were, placed, in, the, family, chapel, other, remains, have, been, found, buried, in, common, city, graveyards, 17, graves, have, been, found, with, very, precious, objects, in, them, it, is, assumed, that, these, were, royal, graves, rich, of, various, periods, have, been, discovered, to, have, sought, burial, in, bahrein, identified, with, sumerian, dilmun, sumerian, temples, functioned, as, banks, and, developed, the, first, large, scale, system, of, loans, and,

approach, irrigated, agriculture, spread, southwards, from, the, zagros, foothills, with, the, samara, and, hadji, muhammed, culture, from, about, 5, 000, bc, in, the, early, period, down, to, ur, iii, temples, owned, up, to, one, third, of, the, available, land, declining, over, time, as, royal, and, other, private, holdings, increased, in, frequency, the, word, ensi, was, used, to, describe, the, official, who, organized, the, work, of, all, facets, of, temple, agriculture, villeins, are, known, to, have, worked, most, frequently, within, agriculture, especially, in, the, grounds, of, temples, or, palaces, the, geography, of, southern, mesopotamia, is, such, that, agriculture, is, possible, only, with, irrigation, and, with, good, drainage, a, fact, which, had, a, profound, effect, on, the, evolution, of, early, mesopotamian, civilization, the, need, for, irrigation, led, the, sumerians, and, later, the, akkadians, to, build, their, cities, along, the, tigris, and, euphrates, and, the, branches, of, these, rivers, major, cities, such, as, ur, and, uruk, took, root, on, tributaries, of, the, euphrates, while, others, notably, lagash, were, built, on, branches, of, the, tigris, the, rivers, provided, the, further, benefits, of, fish, used, both, for, food, and, fertilizer, reeds, and, clay, for, building, materials, with, irrigation, the, food, supply, in, mesopotamia, was, comparable, to, that, of, the, canadian, prairies, the, tigris, and, euphrates, river, valleys, form, the, northeastern, portion, of, the, fertile, crescent, which, also, included, the, jordan, river, valley, and, that, of, the, nile, although, land, nearer, to, the, rivers, was, fertile, and, good, for, crops, portions, of, land, farther, from, the, water, were, dry, and, largely, uninhabitable, thus, the, development, of, irrigation, became, very, important, for, settlers, of, mesopotamia, other, mesopotamian, innovations, include, the, control, of, water, by, dams, and, the, use, of, aqueducts, early, settlers, of, fertile, land, in, mesopotamia, used, wooden, plows, to, soften, the, soil, before, planting, crops, such, as, barley, onions, grapes, turnips, and, apples, mesopotamian, settlers, were, some, of, the, first, people, to, make, beer, and, wine, as, a, result, of, the, skill, involved, in, farming, in, the, mesopotamian, region, farmers, did, not, generally, depend, on, slaves, to, complete, farm, work, for, them, but, there, were, some, exceptions, there, were, too, many, risks, involved, to, make, slavery, practical, i, e, the, escape, mutiny, of, the, slaves, although, the, rivers, sustained, life, they, also, destroyed, it, by, frequent, floods, that, ravaged, entire, cities, the, unpredictable, mesopotamian, weather, was, often, hard, on, farmers, crops, were, often, ruined, so, backup, sources, of, food, such, as, cows, and, lambs, were, kept, over, time, the, southernmost, parts, of, sumerian, mesopotamia, suffered, from, increased, salinity, of, the, soils, leading, to, a, slow, urban, decline, and, a, centring, of, power, in, akkad, further, north, mesopotamian, trade, with, the, indus, valley, civilisation,

1499, of, the, sea, route, between, india, and, europe, and, the, opening, of, the, suez, canal, in, 1869, impacted, on, this, nexus, genetic, studies, on, the, modern, day, people, of, iraq, are, limited, and, generally, restricted, to, analysis, of, classical, keys, due, to, the, country, s, modern, political, instability, although, lately, there, have, been, several, published, studies, displaying, a, genealogical, connection, between, all, iraqis, and, the, neighboring, countries, across, religious, ethnic, and, linguistic, barriers, studies, indicate, that, the, different, ethno, religious, groups, of, iraq, mesopotamia, share, significant, similarities, in, genetics, and, that, mesopotamian, arabs, who, make, up, the, majority, of, iraqis, are, more, genetically, similar, to, iraqi, kurds, than, other, arab, populations, in, the, middle, east, and, arabia, there, were, no, significant, differences, in, y, dna, variation, were, observed, among, iraqi, mesopotamian, arabs, assyrians, or, kurds, modern, genetic, studies, indicate, that, iraqi, mesopotamian, arabs, are, more, related, to, iraqi, assyrians, than, iraqi, kurds, dogan, et, al, 2017, states, that, contemporary, assyrian, and, yazidis, from, northern, iraq, might, have, stronger, continuity, with, the, original, genetic, stock, of, the, mesopotamian, people, which, possibly, provided, the, basis, for, the, ethnogenesis, of, various, subsequent, near, eastern, populations, among, northern, iraqi, assyrians, j, and, r, subclades, were, observed, at, 36, and, 41, respectively, where, r1a, r1b, j1, and, j2, sub, clades, accounted, for, 11, 30, 12, and, 24, for, yazidis, r, haplogroup, subclades, dominate, where, r1a, and, r1b, account, for, 9, and, 21, respectively, the, high, prevalence, of, r, and, j, macrohaplogroups, is, attributed, to, pre, last, glacial, maximum, events, in, the, near, east, many, historians, and, anthropologists, provide, strong, circumstantial, evidence, to, presuppose, that, iraq, s, marsh, arabs, share, very, strong, links, to, the, ancient, sumerians, while, other, studies, indicate, that, the, iraqi, assyrian, population, was, found, to, be, significantly, related, to, other, iraqis, especially, mesopotamian, arabs, likely, due, to, the, assimilation, of, indigenous, assyrians, with, other, people, groups, who, occupied, and, settled, mesopotamia, after, the, fall, of, the, neo, babylonian, empire, the, geography, of, mesopotamia, had, a, profound, impact, on, the, political, development, of, the, region, among, the, rivers, and, streams, the, sumerian, people, built, the, first, cities, along, with, irrigation, canals, which, were, separated, by, vast, stretches, of, open, desert, or, swamp, where, nomadic, tribes, roamed, communication, among, the, isolated, cities, was, difficult, and, at, times, dangerous, thus, each, sumerian, city, became, a, city, state, independent, of, the, others, and, protective, of, its, independence, at, times, one, city, would, try, to, conquer, and, unify, the, region, but, such, efforts, were, resisted, and, failed, for, centuries, as, a, result, the, political, history, of, sumer, is, one, of, almost, constant, warfare, eventually, sumer, was, unified, by, eannatum, the, unification, was, tenuous, and, failed, to, last, as, the, akkadians, conquered, sumer, in, 2331, bc, only, a, generation, later, the, akkadian, empire, was, the, first, successful, empire, to, last, beyond, a, generation, and, see, a, peaceful, succession, of, kings, the, empire, was, relatively, short, lived, as, the, babylonians, conquered, them, within, only, a, few, generations, the, mesopotamians, believed, their, kings, and, queens, were, descended, from, the, city, gods, but, unlike, the, ancient, egyptians, they, never, believed, their, kings, were, real, gods, most, kings, named, themselves, king, of, the, universe, or, great, king, another, common, name, was, shepherd, as, kings, had, to, look, after, their, people, when, assyria, grew, into, an, empire, it, was, divided, into, smaller, parts, called, provinces, each, of, these, were, named, after, their, main, cities, like, nineveh, samaria, damascus, and, arpad, they, all, had, their, own, governor, who, had, to, make, sure, everyone, paid, their, taxes, governors, had, to, call, up, soldiers, to, war, and, supply, workers, when, a, temple, was, built, he, was, responsible, for, enforcing, the, laws, in, this, way, it, was, easier, to, keep, control, of, a, large, empire, although, babylon, was, quite, a, small, state, in, sumer, it, grew, tremendously, throughout, the, time, of, hammurabi, s, rule, he, was, known, as, the, lawmaker, and, created, the, code, of, hammurabi, soon, babylon, became, one, of, the, main, cities, in, mesopotamia, it, was, later, called, babylonia, which, meant, the, gateway, of, the, gods, it, became, one, of, history, s, greatest, centers, of, learning, with, the, end, of, the, uruk, phase, walled, cities, grew, many, isolated, ubaid, villages, were, abandoned, indicating, a, rise, in, communal, violence, an, early, king, lugalbanda, was, supposed, to, have, built, the, white, walls, around, the, city, as, city, states, began, to, grow, their, spheres, of, influence, overlapped, creating, arguments, between, other, city, states, especially, over, land, and, canals, these, arguments, were, recorded, in, tablets, several, hundreds, of, years, before, any, major, war, the, first, recording, of, a, war, occurred, around, 3200, bc, but, was, not, common, until, about, 2500, bc, an, early, dynastic, ii, king, ensi, of, uruk, in, sumer, gilgamesh, c, 2600, bc, was, commended, for, military, exploits, against, humbaba, guardian, of, the, cedar, mountain, and, was, later, celebrated, in, many, later, poems, and, songs, in, which, he, was, claimed, to, be, two, thirds, god, and, only, one, third, human, the, later, stele, of, the, vultures, at, the, end, of, the, early, dynastic, iii, period, 2600, 2350, bc, commemorating, the, victory, of, eannatum, of, lagash, over, the, neighbouring, rival, city, of, umma, is, the, oldest, monument, in, the, world, that, celebrates, a, massacre, from, this, point, forwards, warfare, was, incorporated, into, the, mesopotamian, political, system, at, times, a, neutral, city, acted, as, an, arbitrator, for, two, rival, cities, this, helped, to, form, unions, between, cities, leading, to, regional, states, when, empires, were, created, they, went, to, war, more, with, foreign, countries, king, sargon, for, example, conquered, all, the, cities, of, sumer, some, cities, in, mari, and, then, went, to, war, with, cities, in, modern, day, syria, many, assyrian, and, babylonian, palace, walls, were, decorated, with, pictures, of, the, successful, fights, and, the, enemy, either, desperately, escaping, or, hiding, amongst, reeds, the, neo, babylonian, kings, used, deportation, as, a, means, of, control, like, their, predecessors, the, assyrians, for, the, neo, babylonian, kings, war, was, a, means, to, obtain, tribute, plunder, sought, after, materials, such, as, various, metals, and, quality, wood, and, prisoners, of, war, which, could, be, put, to, work, as, slaves, in, the, temples, which, they, built, the, assyrians, displaced, populations, throughout, their, vast, empire, this, practice, under, the, babylonian, kings, was, more, limited, only, being, used, to, establish, new, populations, in, babylonia, itself, though, royal, inscriptions, from, the, neo, babylonian, period, don, t, speak, of, acts, of, destruction, and, deportation, in, the, same, boastful, way, royal, inscriptions, from, the, neo, assyrian, period, do, this, does, not, prove, that, the, practice, ceased, or, that, the, babylonians, were, less, brutal, than, the, assyrians, since, there, is, evidence, that, the, city, ascalon, was, destroyed, by, nebuchadnezzar, ii, in, 604, bc, city, states, of, mesopotamia, created, the, first, law, codes, drawn, from, legal, precedence, and, decisions, made, by, kings, the, codes, of, urukagina, and, lipit, ishtar, the, code, of, lipit, ishtar, have, been, found, the, most, renowned, of, these, was, that, of, hammurabi, as, mentioned, above, who, was, posthumously, famous, for, his, set, of, laws, the, code, of, hammurabi, created, c, 1780, bc, which, is, one, of, the, earliest, sets, of, laws, found, and, one, of, the, best, preserved, examples, of, this, type, of, document, from, ancient, mesopotamia, he, codified, over, 200, laws, for, mesopotamia, examination, of, the, laws, show, a, progressive, weakening, of, the, rights, of, women, and, increasing, severity, in, the, treatment, of, slaves, the, art, of, mesopotamia, rivalled, that, of, ancient, egypt, as, the, most, grand, sophisticated, and, elaborate, in, western, eurasia, from, the, 4th, millennium, bc, until, the, persian, achaemenid, empire, conquered, the, region, in, the, 6th, century, bc, the, main, emphasis, was, on, very, durable, forms, of, sculpture, in, stone, and, clay, little, painting, has, survived, but, what, has, suggests, that, painting, was, mainly, used, for, geometrical, and, plant, based, decorative, schemes, most, sculpture, was, also, painted, the, protoliterate, period, dominated, by, uruk, saw, the, production, of, sophisticated, works, like, the, warka, vase, and, cylinder, seals, the, guennol, lioness, is, an, outstanding, small, limestone, figure, from, elam, of, about, 3000, 2800, bc, part, man, and, part, lion, a, little, later, there, are, a, number, of, figures, of, large, eyed, priests, and, worshippers, mostly, in, alabaster, and, up, to, a, foot, high, who, attended, temple, cult, images, of, the, deity, but, very, few, of, these, have, survived, sculptures, from, the, sumerian, and, akkadian, period, generally, had, large, staring, eyes, and, long, beards, on, the, men, many, masterpieces, have, been, found, at, the, royal, cemetery, at, ur, c, 2650, bc, including, the, two, figures, of, a, ram, in, a, thicket, the, copper, bull, and, a, bull, s, head, on, one, of, the, lyres, of, ur, from, the, many, subsequent, periods, before, the, ascendency, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, mesopotamian, art, survives, in, a, number, of, forms, cylinder, seals, relatively, small, figures, in, the, round, and, reliefs, of, various, sizes, including, cheap, plaques, of, moulded, pottery, for, the, home, some, religious, and, some, apparently, not, the, burney, relief, is, an, unusual, elaborate, and, relatively, large, 20, x, 15, inches, terracotta, plaque, of, a, naked, winged, goddess, with, the, feet, of, a, bird, of, prey, and, attendant, owls, and, lions, it, comes, from, the, 18th, or, 19th, century, bc, and, may, also, be, moulded, stone, stelae, votive, offerings, or, ones, probably, commemorating, victories, and, showing, feasts, are, found, from, temples, which, unlike, more, official, ones, lack, inscriptions, that, would, explain, them, the, fragmentary, stele, of, the, vultures, is, an, early, example, of, the, inscribed, type, the, assyrian, black, obelisk, of, shalmaneser, iii, a, large, and, solid, late, one, the, conquest, of, the, whole, of, mesopotamia, and, much, surrounding, territory, by, the, assyrians, created, a, larger, and, wealthier, state, than, the, region, had, known, before, and, very, grandiose, art, in, palaces, and, public, places, no, doubt, partly, intended, to, match, the, splendour, of, the, art, of, the, neighbouring, egyptian, empire, the, assyrians, developed, a, style, of, extremely, large, schemes, of, very, finely, detailed, narrative, low, reliefs, in, stone, for, palaces, with, scenes, of, war, or, hunting, the, british, museum, has, an, outstanding, collection, they, produced, very, little, sculpture, in, the, round, except, for, colossal, guardian, figures, often, the, human, headed,
