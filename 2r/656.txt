the, history, of, chemistry, represents, a, time, span, from, ancient, history, to, the, present, by, 1000, bc, civilizations, used, technologies, that, would, eventually, form, the, basis, of, the, various, branches, of, chemistry, examples, include, the, discovery, of, fire, extracting, metals, from, ores, making, pottery, and, glazes, fermenting, beer, and, wine, extracting, chemicals, from, plants, for, medicine, and, perfume, rendering, fat, into, soap, making, glass, and, making, alloys, like, bronze, the, protoscience, of, chemistry, and, alchemy, was, unsuccessful, in, explaining, the, nature, of, matter, and, its, transformations, however, by, performing, experiments, and, recording, the, results, alchemists, set, the, stage, for, modern, chemistry, the, history, of, chemistry, is, intertwined, with, the, history, of, thermodynamics, especially, through, the, work, of, willard, gibbs, arguably, the, first, chemical, reaction, used, in, a, controlled, manner, was, fire, however, for, millennia, fire, was, seen, simply, as, a, mystical, force, that, could, transform, one, substance, into, another, burning, wood, or, boiling, water, while, producing, heat, and, light, fire, affected, many, aspects, of, early, societies, these, ranged, from, the, simplest, facets, of, everyday, life, such, as, cooking, and, habitat, heating, and, lighting, to, more, advanced, uses, such, as, making, pottery, and, bricks, and, melting, of, metals, to, make, tools, it, was, fire, that, led, to, the, discovery, of, glass, and, the, purification, of, metals, this, was, followed, by, the, rise, of, metallurgy, a, 100, 000, year, old, ochre, processing, workshop, was, found, at, blombos, cave, in, south, africa, it, indicates, that, early, humans, had, an, elementary, knowledge, of, mineral, processing, paintings, drawn, by, early, humans, consisting, of, early, humans, mixing, animal, blood, with, other, liquids, found, on, cave, walls, also, indicate, a, small, knowledge, of, chemistry, the, earliest, recorded, metal, employed, by, humans, seems, to, be, gold, which, can, be, found, free, or, native, small, amounts, of, natural, gold, have, been, found, in, spanish, caves, used, during, the, late, paleolithic, period, around, 40, 000, bc, the, earliest, gold, metallurgy, is, known, from, the, varna, culture, in, bulgaria, dating, from, c, 4600, bc, silver, copper, tin, and, meteoric, iron, can, also, be, found, native, allowing, a, limited, amount, of, metalworking, in, ancient, cultures, egyptian, weapons, made, from, meteoric, iron, in, about, 3000, bc, were, highly, prized, as, daggers, from, heaven, during, the, early, stages, of, metallurgy, methods, of, purification, of, metals, were, sought, and, gold, known, in, ancient, egypt, as, early, as, 2900, bc, became, a, precious, metal, certain, metals, can, be, recovered, from, their, ores, by, simply, heating, the, rocks, in, a, fire, notably, tin, lead, and, at, a, higher, temperature, copper, this, process, is, known, as, smelting, the, first, evidence, of, this, extractive, metallurgy, dates, from, the, 6th, and, 5th, millennia, bc, and, was, found, in, the, archaeological, sites, of, the, vin, a, culture, majdanpek, jarmovac, and, plo, nik, in, serbia, the, earliest, copper, smelting, is, found, at, the, belovode, site, these, examples, include, a, copper, axe, from, 5500, bc, other, signs, of, early, metals, are, found, from, the, third, millennium, bc, in, places, like, palmela, portugal, los, millares, spain, and, stonehenge, united, kingdom, however, as, often, happens, in, the, study, of, prehistoric, times, the, ultimate, beginnings, cannot, be, clearly, defined, and, new, discoveries, are, ongoing, these, first, metals, were, single, elements, or, else, combinations, as, naturally, occurred, by, combining, copper, and, tin, a, superior, metal, could, be, made, an, alloy, called, bronze, this, was, a, major, technological, shift, that, began, the, bronze, age, about, 3500, bc, the, bronze, age, was, a, period, in, human, cultural, development, when, the, most, advanced, metalworking, at, least, in, systematic, and, widespread, use, included, techniques, for, smelting, copper, and, tin, from, naturally, occurring, outcroppings, of, copper, ores, and, then, smelting, those, ores, to, cast, bronze, these, naturally, occurring, ores, typically, included, arsenic, as, a, common, impurity, copper, tin, ores, are, rare, as, reflected, in, the, absence, of, tin, bronzes, in, western, asia, before, 3000, bc, after, the, bronze, age, the, history, of, metallurgy, was, marked, by, armies, seeking, better, weaponry, states, in, eurasia, prospered, when, they, made, the, superior, alloys, which, in, turn, made, better, armor, and, better, weapons, significant, progress, in, metallurgy, and, alchemy, was, made, in, ancient, india, the, extraction, of, iron, from, its, ore, into, a, workable, metal, is, much, more, difficult, than, copper, or, tin, while, iron, is, not, better, suited, for, tools, than, bronze, until, steel, was, discovered, iron, ore, is, much, more, abundant, and, common, than, either, copper, or, tin, and, therefore, more, often, available, locally, with, no, need, to, trade, for, it, iron, working, appears, to, have, been, invented, by, the, hittites, in, about, 1200, bc, beginning, the, iron, age, the, secret, of, extracting, and, working, iron, was, a, key, factor, in, the, success, of, the, philistines, the, iron, age, refers, to, the, advent, of, iron, working, ferrous, metallurgy, historical, developments, in, ferrous, metallurgy, can, be, found, in, a, wide, variety, of, past, cultures, and, civilizations, these, include, the, ancient, and, medieval, kingdoms, and, empires, of, the, middle, east, and, near, east, ancient, iran, ancient, egypt, ancient, nubia, and, anatolia, turkey, ancient, nok, carthage, the, greeks, and, romans, of, ancient, europe, medieval, europe, ancient, and, medieval, china, ancient, and, medieval, india, ancient, and, medieval, japan, amongst, others, many, applications, practices, and, devices, associated, with, or, involved, in, metallurgy, were, established, in, ancient, china, such, as, the, innovation, of, the, blast, furnace, cast, iron, hydraulic, powered, trip, hammers, and, double, acting, piston, bellows, philosophical, attempts, to, rationalize, why, different, substances, have, different, properties, color, density, smell, exist, in, different, states, gaseous, liquid, and, solid, and, react, in, a, different, manner, when, exposed, to, environments, for, example, to, water, or, fire, or, temperature, changes, led, ancient, philosophers, to, postulate, the, first, theories, on, nature, and, chemistry, the, history, of, such, philosophical, theories, that, relate, to, chemistry, can, probably, be, traced, back, to, every, single, ancient, civilization, the, common, aspect, in, all, these, theories, was, the, attempt, to, identify, a, small, number, of, primary, classical, elements, that, make, up, all, the, various, substances, in, nature, substances, like, air, water, and, soil, earth, energy, forms, such, as, fire, and, light, and, more, abstract, concepts, such, as, thoughts, aether, and, heaven, were, common, in, ancient, civilizations, even, in, the, absence, of, any, cross, fertilization, for, example, ancient, greek, indian, mayan, and, chinese, philosophies, all, considered, air, water, earth, and, fire, as, primary, elements, around, 420, bc, empedocles, stated, that, all, matter, is, made, up, of, four, elemental, substances, earth, fire, air, and, water, the, early, theory, of, atomism, can, be, traced, back, to, ancient, greece, greek, atomism, was, made, popular, by, the, greek, philosopher, democritus, who, declared, that, matter, is, composed, of, indivisible, and, indestructible, particles, called, atomos, around, 380, bc, earlier, leucippus, also, declared, that, atoms, were, the, most, indivisible, part, of, matter, this, coincided, with, a, similar, declaration, by, the, indian, philosopher, kanada, in, his, vaisheshika, sutras, around, the, same, time, period, aristotle, opposed, the, existence, of, atoms, in, 330, bc, a, greek, text, attributed, to, polybus, the, physician, ca, 380, bc, argued, that, the, human, body, is, composed, of, four, humours, instead, epicurus, fl, 300, bc, postulated, a, universe, of, indestructible, atoms, in, which, man, himself, is, responsible, for, achieving, a, balanced, life, with, the, goal, of, explaining, epicurean, philosophy, to, a, roman, audience, the, roman, poet, and, philosopher, lucretius, wrote, de, rerum, natura, on, the, nature, of, things, in, the, middle, of, the, first, century, bc, in, the, work, lucretius, presents, the, principles, of, atomism, the, nature, of, the, mind, and, soul, explanations, of, sensation, and, thought, the, development, of, the, world, and, its, phenomena, and, explains, a, variety, of, celestial, and, terrestrial, phenomena, the, earliest, alchemists, in, the, western, tradition, seemed, to, have, come, from, greco, roman, egypt, in, the, first, centuries, ad, in, addition, to, technical, work, many, of, them, invented, chemical, apparatuses, the, bain, marie, or, water, bath, is, named, for, mary, the, jewess, her, work, also, gives, the, first, descriptions, of, the, tribikos, and, kerotakis, cleopatra, the, alchemist, described, furnaces, and, has, been, credited, with, the, invention, of, the, alembic, later, zosimos, of, panopolis, wrote, books, on, alchemy, which, he, called, cheirokmeta, the, greek, word, for, things, made, by, hand, these, works, include, many, references, to, recipes, and, procedures, as, well, as, descriptions, of, instruments, much, of, the, early, development, of, purification, methods, were, described, earlier, by, pliny, the, elder, in, his, naturalis, historia, he, tried, to, explain, those, methods, as, well, as, making, acute, observations, of, the, state, of, many, minerals, the, elemental, system, used, in, medieval, alchemy, was, developed, primarily, by, the, persian, or, arab, alchemist, j, bir, ibn, hayy, n, and, was, rooted, in, the, classical, elements, of, greek, tradition, his, system, consisted, of, the, four, aristotelian, elements, of, air, earth, fire, and, water, in, addition, to, two, philosophical, elements, sulphur, characterizing, the, principle, of, combustibility, the, stone, which, burns, and, mercury, characterizing, the, principle, of, metallic, properties, they, were, seen, by, early, alchemists, as, idealized, expressions, of, irreducible, components, of, the, universe, and, are, of, larger, consideration, within, philosophical, alchemy, the, three, metallic, principles, sulphur, to, flammability, or, combustion, mercury, to, volatility, and, stability, and, salt, to, solidity, became, the, tria, prima, of, the, swiss, alchemist, paracelsus, he, reasoned, that, aristotle, s, four, element, theory, appeared, in, bodies, as, three, principles, paracelsus, saw, these, principles, as, fundamental, and, justified, them, by, recourse, to, the, description, of, how, wood, burns, in, fire, mercury, included, the, cohesive, principle, so, that, when, it, left, the, wood, in, smoke, the, wood, fell, apart, smoke, described, the, volatility, the, mercurial, principle, the, heat, giving, flames, described, flammability, sulphur, and, the, remnant, ash, described, solidity, salt, alchemy, is, defined, by, the, hermetic, quest, for, the, philosopher, s, stone, the, study, of, which, is, steeped, in, symbolic, mysticism, and, differs, greatly, from, modern, science, alchemists, toiled, to, make, transformations, on, an, esoteric, spiritual, and, or, exoteric, practical, level, it, was, the, protoscientific, exoteric, aspects, of, alchemy, that, contributed, heavily, to, the, evolution, of, chemistry, in, greco, roman, egypt, in, the, islamic, golden, age, and, then, in, europe, alchemy, and, chemistry, share, an, interest, in, the, composition, and, properties, of, matter, and, until, the, 18th, century, they, were, not, separate, disciplines, the, term, chymistry, has, been, used, to, describe, the, blend, of, alchemy, and, chemistry, that, existed, before, that, time, during, the, renaissance, exoteric, alchemy, remained, popular, in, the, form, of, paracelsian, iatrochemistry, while, spiritual, alchemy, flourished, realigned, to, its, platonic, hermetic, and, gnostic, roots, consequently, the, symbolic, quest, for, the, philosopher, s, stone, was, not, superseded, by, scientific, advances, and, was, still, the, domain, of, respected, scientists, and, doctors, until, the, early, 18th, century, early, modern, alchemists, who, are, renowned, for, their, scientific, contributions, include, jan, baptist, van, helmont, robert, boyle, and, isaac, newton, in, the, islamic, world, the, muslims, were, translating, the, works, of, ancient, greek, and, hellenistic, philosophers, into, arabic, and, were, experimenting, with, scientific, ideas, the, arabic, works, attributed, to, the, 8th, century, alchemist, j, bir, ibn, hayy, n, introduced, a, systematic, classification, of, chemical, substances, and, provided, instructions, for, deriving, an, inorganic, compound, sal, ammoniac, or, ammonium, chloride, from, organic, substances, such, as, plants, blood, and, hair, by, chemical, means, some, arabic, jabirian, works, e, g, the, book, of, mercy, and, the, book, of, seventy, were, later, translated, into, latin, under, the, latinized, name, geber, and, in, 13th, century, europe, an, anonymous, writer, usually, referred, to, as, pseudo, geber, started, to, produce, alchemical, and, metallurgical, writings, under, this, name, later, influential, muslim, philosophers, such, as, ab, al, rayh, n, al, b, r, n, and, avicenna, disputed, the, theories, of, alchemy, particularly, the, theory, of, the, transmutation, of, metals, there, were, several, problems, with, alchemy, as, seen, from, today, s, standpoint, there, was, no, systematic, naming, scheme, for, new, compounds, and, the, language, was, esoteric, and, vague, to, the, point, that, the, terminologies, meant, different, things, to, different, people, in, fact, according, to, the, fontana, history, of, chemistry, brock, 1992, the, language, of, alchemy, soon, developed, an, arcane, and, secretive, technical, vocabulary, designed, to, conceal, information, from, the, uninitiated, to, a, large, degree, this, language, is, incomprehensible, to, us, today, though, it, is, apparent, that, readers, of, geoffery, chaucer, s, canon, s, yeoman, s, tale, or, audiences, of, ben, jonson, s, the, alchemist, were, able, to, construe, it, sufficiently, to, laugh, at, it, chaucer, s, tale, exposed, the, more, fraudulent, side, of, alchemy, especially, the, manufacture, of, counterfeit, gold, from, cheap, substances, less, than, a, century, earlier, dante, alighieri, also, demonstrated, an, awareness, of, this, fraudulence, causing, him, to, consign, all, alchemists, to, the, inferno, in, his, writings, soon, afterwards, in, 1317, the, avignon, pope, john, xxii, ordered, all, alchemists, to, leave, france, for, making, counterfeit, money, a, law, was, passed, in, england, in, 1403, which, made, the, multiplication, of, metals, punishable, by, death, despite, these, and, other, apparently, extreme, measures, alchemy, did, not, die, royalty, and, privileged, classes, still, sought, to, discover, the, philosopher, s, stone, and, the, elixir, of, life, for, themselves, there, was, also, no, agreed, upon, scientific, method, for, making, experiments, reproducible, indeed, many, alchemists, included, in, their, methods, irrelevant, information, such, as, the, timing, of, the, tides, or, the, phases, of, the, moon, the, esoteric, nature, and, codified, vocabulary, of, alchemy, appeared, to, be, more, useful, in, concealing, the, fact, that, they, could, not, be, sure, of, very, much, at, all, as, early, as, the, 14th, century, cracks, seemed, to, grow, in, the, facade, of, alchemy, and, people, became, sceptical, clearly, there, needed, to, be, a, scientific, method, in, which, experiments, could, be, repeated, by, other, people, and, results, needed, to, be, reported, in, a, clear, language, that, laid, out, both, what, was, known, and, what, was, unknown, practical, attempts, to, improve, the, refining, of, ores, and, their, extraction, to, smelt, metals, was, an, important, source, of, information, for, early, chemists, in, the, 16th, century, among, them, georg, agricola, 1494, 1555, who, published, his, great, work, de, re, metallica, in, 1556, his, work, describes, the, highly, developed, and, complex, processes, of, mining, metal, ores, metal, extraction, and, metallurgy, of, the, time, his, approach, removed, the, mysticism, associated, with, the, subject, creating, the, practical, base, upon, which, others, could, build, the, work, describes, the, many, kinds, of, furnace, used, to, smelt, ore, and, stimulated, interest, in, minerals, and, their, composition, it, is, no, coincidence, that, he, gives, numerous, references, to, the, earlier, author, pliny, the, elder, and, his, naturalis, historia, agricola, has, been, described, as, the, father, of, metallurgy, and, the, founder, of, geology, as, a, scientific, discipline, in, 1605, sir, francis, bacon, published, the, proficience, and, advancement, of, learning, which, contains, a, description, of, what, would, later, be, known, as, the, scientific, method, in, 1605, michal, sedziw, j, publishes, the, alchemical, treatise, a, new, light, of, alchemy, which, proposed, the, existence, of, the, food, of, life, within, air, much, later, recognized, as, oxygen, in, 1615, jean, beguin, published, the, tyrocinium, chymicum, an, early, chemistry, textbook, and, in, it, draws, the, first, ever, chemical, equation, in, 1637, ren, descartes, publishes, discours, de, la, m, thode, which, contains, an, outline, of, the, scientific, method, the, dutch, chemist, jan, baptist, van, helmont, s, work, ortus, medicinae, was, published, posthumously, in, 1648, the, book, is, cited, by, some, as, a, major, transitional, work, between, alchemy, and, chemistry, and, as, an, important, influence, on, robert, boyle, the, book, contains, the, results, of, numerous, experiments, and, establishes, an, early, version, of, the, law, of, conservation, of, mass, working, during, the, time, just, after, paracelsus, and, iatrochemistry, jan, baptist, van, helmont, suggested, that, there, are, insubstantial, substances, other, than, air, and, coined, a, name, for, them, gas, from, the, greek, word, chaos, in, addition, to, introducing, the, word, gas, into, the, vocabulary, of, scientists, van, helmont, conducted, several, experiments, involving, gases, jan, baptist, van, helmont, is, also, remembered, today, largely, for, his, ideas, on, spontaneous, generation, and, his, 5, year, tree, experiment, as, well, as, being, considered, the, founder, of, pneumatic, chemistry, anglo, irish, chemist, robert, boyle, 1627, 1691, is, considered, to, have, initiated, the, gradual, separation, of, chemistry, from, alchemy, although, skeptical, of, elements, and, convinced, of, alchemy, boyle, played, a, key, part, in, elevating, the, sacred, art, as, an, independent, fundamental, and, philosophical, discipline, he, is, best, known, for, boyle, s, law, which, he, presented, in, 1662, though, he, was, not, the, first, to, discover, it, the, law, describes, the, inversely, proportional, relationship, between, the, absolute, pressure, and, volume, of, a, gas, if, the, temperature, is, kept, constant, within, a, closed, system, boyle, is, also, credited, for, his, landmark, publication, the, sceptical, chymist, 1661, which, advocated, for, a, rigorous, approach, to, experimentation, among, chemists, in, the, work, boyle, questioned, some, commonly, held, alchemical, theories, and, argued, for, practitioners, to, be, more, philosophical, and, less, commercially, focused, he, rejected, the, classical, four, elements, of, earth, fire, air, and, water, and, proposed, a, mechanistic, alternative, of, atoms, and, chemical, reactions, that, could, be, subject, to, rigorous, experiment, boyle, also, tried, to, purify, chemicals, to, obtain, reproducible, reactions, he, was, a, vocal, proponent, of, the, mechanical, philosophy, proposed, by, ren, descartes, to, explain, and, quantify, the, physical, properties, and, interactions, of, material, substances, boyle, was, an, atomist, but, favoured, the, word, corpuscle, over, atoms, he, commented, that, the, finest, division, of, matter, where, the, properties, are, retained, is, at, the, level, of, corpuscles, boyle, repeated, the, tree, experiment, of, van, helmont, and, was, the, first, to, use, indicators, which, changed, colors, with, acidity, he, also, performed, numerous, investigations, with, an, air, pump, and, noted, that, the, mercury, fell, as, air, was, pumped, out, he, also, observed, that, pumping, the, air, out, of, a, container, would, extinguish, a, flame, and, kill, small, animals, placed, inside, through, his, works, boyle, helped, to, lay, the, foundations, for, the, chemical, revolution, two, centuries, later, in, 1702, german, chemist, georg, stahl, coined, the, name, phlogiston, for, the, substance, believed, to, be, released, in, the, process, of, burning, around, 1735, swedish, chemist, georg, brandt, analyzed, a, dark, blue, pigment, found, in, copper, ore, brandt, demonstrated, that, the, pigment, contained, a, new, element, later, named, cobalt, in, 1751, a, swedish, chemist, and, pupil, of, stahl, s, named, axel, fredrik, cronstedt, identified, an, impurity, in, copper, ore, as, a, separate, metallic, element, which, he, named, nickel, cronstedt, is, one, of, the, founders, of, modern, mineralogy, cronstedt, also, discovered, the, mineral, scheelite, in, 1751, which, he, named, tungsten, meaning, heavy, stone, in, swedish, in, 1754, scottish, chemist, joseph, black, isolated, carbon, dioxide, which, he, called, fixed, air, in, 1757, louis, claude, cadet, de, gassicourt, while, investigating, arsenic, compounds, creates, cadet, s, fuming, liquid, later, discovered, to, be, cacodyl, oxide, considered, to, be, the, first, synthetic, organometallic, compound, in, 1758, joseph, black, formulated, the, concept, of, latent, heat, to, explain, the, thermochemistry, of, phase, changes, in, 1766, english, chemist, henry, cavendish, isolated, hydrogen, which, he, called, inflammable, air, cavendish, discovered, hydrogen, as, a, colorless, odourless, gas, that, burns, and, can, form, an, explosive, mixture, with, air, and, published, a, paper, on, the, production, of, water, by, burning, inflammable, air, that, is, hydrogen, in, dephlogisticated, air, now, known, to, be, oxygen, the, latter, a, constituent, of, atmospheric, air, phlogiston, theory, in, 1773, swedish, german, chemist, carl, wilhelm, scheele, discovered, oxygen, which, he, called, fire, air, but, did, not, immediately, publish, his, achievement, in, 1774, english, chemist, joseph, priestley, independently, isolated, oxygen, in, its, gaseous, state, calling, it, dephlogisticated, air, and, published, his, work, before, scheele, during, his, lifetime, priestley, s, considerable, scientific, reputation, rested, on, his, invention, of, soda, water, his, writings, on, electricity, and, his, discovery, of, several, airs, gases, the, most, famous, being, what, priestley, dubbed, dephlogisticated, air, oxygen, however, priestley, s, determination, to, defend, phlogiston, theory, and, to, reject, what, would, become, the, chemical, revolution, eventually, left, him, isolated, within, the, scientific, community, in, 1781, carl, wilhelm, scheele, discovered, that, a, new, acid, tungstic, acid, could, be, made, from, cronstedt, s, scheelite, at, the, time, named, tungsten, scheele, and, torbern, bergman, suggested, that, it, might, be, possible, to, obtain, a, new, metal, by, reducing, this, acid, in, 1783, jos, and, fausto, elhuyar, found, an, acid, made, from, wolframite, that, was, identical, to, tungstic, acid, later, that, year, in, spain, the, brothers, succeeded, in, isolating, the, metal, now, known, as, tungsten, by, reduction, of, this, acid, with, charcoal, and, they, are, credited, with, the, discovery, of, the, element, italian, physicist, alessandro, volta, constructed, a, device, for, accumulating, a, large, charge, by, a, series, of, inductions, and, groundings, he, investigated, the, 1780s, discovery, animal, electricity, by, luigi, galvani, and, found, that, the, electric, current, was, generated, from, the, contact, of, dissimilar, metals, and, that, the, frog, leg, was, only, acting, as, a, detector, volta, demonstrated, in, 1794, that, when, two, metals, and, brine, soaked, cloth, or, cardboard, are, arranged, in, a, circuit, they, produce, an, electric, current, in, 1800, volta, stacked, several, pairs, of, alternating, copper, or, silver, and, zinc, discs, electrodes, separated, by, cloth, or, cardboard, soaked, in, brine, electrolyte, to, increase, the, electrolyte, conductivity, when, the, top, and, bottom, contacts, were, connected, by, a, wire, an, electric, current, flowed, through, this, voltaic, pile, and, the, connecting, wire, thus, volta, is, credited, with, constructing, the, first, electrical, battery, to, produce, electricity, thus, volta, is, considered, to, be, the, founder, of, the, discipline, of, electrochemistry, a, galvanic, cell, or, voltaic, cell, is, an, electrochemical, cell, that, derives, electrical, energy, from, a, spontaneous, redox, reaction, taking, place, within, the, cell, it, generally, consists, of, two, different, metals, connected, by, a, salt, bridge, or, individual, half, cells, separated, by, a, porous, membrane, antoine, laurent, de, lavoisier, demonstrated, with, careful, measurements, that, transmutation, of, water, to, earth, was, not, possible, but, that, the, sediment, observed, from, boiling, water, came, from, the, container, he, burnt, phosphorus, and, sulfur, in, air, and, proved, that, the, products, weighed, more, than, the, original, samples, with, the, mass, gained, being, lost, from, the, air, thus, in, 1789, he, established, the, law, of, conservation, of, mass, which, is, also, called, lavoisier, s, law, repeating, the, experiments, of, priestley, he, demonstrated, that, air, is, composed, of, two, parts, one, of, which, combines, with, metals, to, form, calxes, in, consid, rations, g, n, rales, sur, la, nature, des, acides, 1778, he, demonstrated, that, the, air, responsible, for, combustion, was, also, the, source, of, acidity, the, next, year, he, named, this, portion, oxygen, greek, for, acid, former, and, the, other, azote, greek, for, no, life, because, of, his, more, thorough, characterization, of, it, as, an, element, lavoisier, thus, has, a, claim, to, the, discovery, of, oxygen, along, with, priestley, and, scheele, he, also, discovered, that, the, inflammable, air, discovered, by, cavendish, which, he, termed, hydrogen, greek, for, water, former, combined, with, oxygen, to, produce, a, dew, as, priestley, had, reported, which, appeared, to, be, water, in, reflexions, sur, le, phlogistique, 1783, lavoisier, showed, the, phlogiston, theory, of, combustion, to, be, inconsistent, mikhail, lomonosov, independently, established, a, tradition, of, chemistry, in, russia, in, the, 18th, century, he, also, rejected, the, phlogiston, theory, and, anticipated, the, kinetic, theory, of, gases, lomonosov, regarded, heat, as, a, form, of, motion, and, stated, the, idea, of, conservation, of, matter, lavoisier, worked, with, claude, louis, berthollet, and, others, to, devise, a, system, of, chemical, nomenclature, which, serves, as, the, basis, of, the, modern, system, of, naming, chemical, compounds, in, his, methods, of, chemical, nomenclature, 1787, lavoisier, invented, the, system, of, naming, and, classification, still, largely, in, use, today, including, names, such, as, sulfuric, acid, sulfates, and, sulfites, in, 1785, berthollet, was, the, first, to, introduce, the, use, of, chlorine, gas, as, a, commercial, bleach, in, the, same, year, he, first, determined, the, elemental, composition, of, the, gas, ammonia, berthollet, first, produced, a, modern, bleaching, liquid, in, 1789, by, passing, chlorine, gas, through, a, solution, of, sodium, carbonate, the, result, was, a, weak, solution, of, sodium, hypochlorite, another, strong, chlorine, oxidant, and, bleach, which, he, investigated, and, was, the, first, to, produce, potassium, chlorate, kclo, 3, is, known, as, berthollet, s, salt, berthollet, is, also, known, for, his, scientific, contributions, to, the, theory, of, chemical, equilibrium, via, the, mechanism, of, reversible, reactions, lavoisier, s, trait, l, mentaire, de, chimie, elementary, treatise, of, chemistry, 1789, was, the, first, modern, chemical, textbook, and, presented, a, unified, view, of, new, theories, of, chemistry, contained, a, clear, statement, of, the, law, of, conservation, of, mass, and, denied, the, existence, of, phlogiston, in, addition, it, contained, a, list, of, elements, or, substances, that, could, not, be, broken, down, further, which, included, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, phosphorus, mercury, zinc, and, sulfur, his, list, however, also, included, light, and, caloric, which, he, believed, to, be, material, substances, in, the, work, lavoisier, underscored, the, observational, basis, of, his, chemistry, stating, i, have, tried, to, arrive, at, the, truth, by, linking, up, facts, to, suppress, as, much, as, possible, the, use, of, reasoning, which, is, often, an, unreliable, instrument, which, deceives, us, in, order, to, follow, as, much, as, possible, the, torch, of, observation, and, of, experiment, nevertheless, he, believed, that, the, real, existence, of, atoms, was, philosophically, impossible, lavoisier, demonstrated, that, organisms, disassemble, and, reconstitute, atmospheric, air, in, the, same, manner, as, a, burning, body, with, pierre, simon, laplace, lavoisier, used, a, calorimeter, to, estimate, the, heat, evolved, per, unit, of, carbon, dioxide, produced, they, found, the, same, ratio, for, a, flame, and, animals, indicating, that, animals, produced, energy, by, a, type, of, combustion, lavoisier, believed, in, the, radical, theory, which, stated, that, radicals, which, function, as, a, single, group, in, a, chemical, reaction, would, combine, with, oxygen, in, reactions, he, believed, all, acids, contained, oxygen, he, also, discovered, that, diamond, is, a, crystalline, form, of, carbon, although, many, of, lavoisier, s, partners, were, influential, for, the, advancement, of, chemistry, as, a, scientific, discipline, his, wife, marie, anne, lavoisier, was, arguably, the, most, influential, of, them, all, upon, their, marriage, mme, lavoisier, began, to, study, chemistry, english, and, drawing, in, order, to, help, her, husband, in, his, work, either, by, translating, papers, into, english, a, language, which, lavoisier, did, not, know, or, by, keeping, records, and, drawing, the, various, apparatuses, that, lavoisier, used, in, his, labs, through, her, ability, to, read, and, translate, articles, from, britain, for, her, husband, lavoisier, had, access, to, knowledge, of, many, of, the, chemical, advances, happening, outside, of, his, lab, furthermore, mme, lavoisier, kept, records, of, her, husband, s, work, and, ensured, that, his, works, were, published, the, first, sign, of, marie, anne, s, true, potential, as, a, chemist, in, lavoisier, s, lab, came, when, she, was, translating, a, book, by, the, scientist, richard, kirwan, while, translating, she, stumbled, upon, and, corrected, multiple, errors, when, she, presented, her, translation, along, with, her, notes, to, lavoisier, her, contributions, led, to, lavoisier, s, refutation, of, the, theory, of, phlogiston, lavoisier, made, many, fundamental, contributions, to, the, science, of, chemistry, following, his, work, chemistry, acquired, a, strict, quantitative, nature, allowing, reliable, predictions, to, be, made, the, revolution, in, chemistry, which, he, brought, about, was, a, result, of, a, conscious, effort, to, fit, all, experiments, into, the, framework, of, a, single, theory, he, established, the, consistent, use, of, chemical, balance, used, oxygen, to, overthrow, the, phlogiston, theory, and, developed, a, new, system, of, chemical, nomenclature, further, potential, contributions, were, cut, short, when, lavoisier, was, beheaded, during, the, french, revolution, throughout, the, 19th, century, chemistry, was, divided, between, those, who, followed, the, atomic, theory, of, john, dalton, and, the, energeticists, such, as, wilhelm, ostwald, and, ernst, mach, although, such, proponents, of, the, atomic, theory, as, amedeo, avogadro, and, ludwig, boltzmann, made, great, advances, in, explaining, the, behavior, of, gases, this, dispute, was, not, finally, settled, until, jean, perrin, s, experimental, investigation, of, einstein, s, atomic, explanation, of, brownian, motion, in, the, first, decade, of, the, 20th, century, well, before, the, dispute, had, been, settled, many, had, already, applied, the, concept, of, atomism, to, chemistry, a, major, example, was, the, ion, theory, of, svante, arrhenius, which, anticipated, ideas, about, atomic, substructure, that, did, not, fully, develop, until, the, 20th, century, michael, faraday, was, another, early, worker, whose, major, contribution, to, chemistry, was, electrochemistry, in, which, among, other, things, a, certain, quantity, of, electricity, during, electrolysis, or, electrodeposition, of, metals, was, shown, to, be, associated, with, certain, quantities, of, chemical, elements, and, fixed, quantities, of, the, elements, therefore, with, each, other, in, specific, ratios, these, findings, like, those, of, dalton, s, combining, ratios, were, early, clues, to, the, atomic, nature, of, matter, in, 1803, english, meteorologist, and, chemist, john, dalton, proposed, dalton, s, law, which, describes, the, relationship, between, the, components, in, a, mixture, of, gases, and, the, relative, pressure, each, contributes, to, that, of, the, overall, mixture, discovered, in, 1801, this, concept, is, also, known, as, dalton, s, law, of, partial, pressures, dalton, also, proposed, a, modern, atomic, theory, in, 1803, which, stated, that, all, matter, was, composed, of, small, indivisible, particles, termed, atoms, atoms, of, a, given, element, possess, unique, characteristics, and, weight, and, three, types, of, atoms, exist, simple, elements, compound, simple, molecules, and, complex, complex, molecules, in, 1808, dalton, first, published, new, system, of, chemical, philosophy, 1808, 1827, in, which, he, outlined, the, first, modern, scientific, description, of, the, atomic, theory, this, work, identified, chemical, elements, as, a, specific, type, of, atom, therefore, rejecting, newton, s, theory, of, chemical, affinities, instead, dalton, inferred, proportions, of, elements, in, compounds, by, taking, ratios, of, the, weights, of, reactants, setting, the, atomic, weight, of, hydrogen, to, be, identically, one, following, jeremias, benjamin, richter, known, for, introducing, the, term, stoichiometry, he, proposed, that, chemical, elements, combine, in, integral, ratios, this, is, known, as, the, law, of, multiple, proportions, or, dalton, s, law, and, dalton, included, a, clear, description, of, the, law, in, his, new, system, of, chemical, philosophy, the, law, of, multiple, proportions, is, one, of, the, basic, laws, of, stoichiometry, used, to, establish, the, atomic, theory, despite, the, importance, of, the, work, as, the, first, view, of, atoms, as, physically, real, entities, and, the, introduction, of, a, system, of, chemical, symbols, new, system, of, chemical, philosophy, devoted, almost, as, much, space, to, the, caloric, theory, as, to, atomism, french, chemist, joseph, proust, proposed, the, law, of, definite, proportions, which, states, that, elements, always, combine, in, small, whole, number, ratios, to, form, compounds, based, on, several, experiments, conducted, between, 1797, and, 1804, along, with, the, law, of, multiple, proportions, the, law, of, definite, proportions, forms, the, basis, of, stoichiometry, the, law, of, definite, proportions, and, constant, composition, do, not, prove, that, atoms, exist, but, they, are, difficult, to, explain, without, assuming, that, chemical, compounds, are, formed, when, atoms, combine, in, constant, proportions, a, swedish, chemist, and, disciple, of, dalton, j, ns, jacob, berzelius, embarked, on, a, systematic, program, to, try, to, make, accurate, and, precise, quantitative, measurements, and, to, ensure, the, purity, of, chemicals, along, with, lavoisier, boyle, and, dalton, berzelius, is, known, as, the, father, of, modern, chemistry, in, 1828, he, compiled, a, table, of, relative, atomic, weights, where, oxygen, was, used, as, a, standard, with, its, weight, set, at, 100, and, which, included, all, of, the, elements, known, at, the, time, this, work, provided, evidence, in, favor, of, dalton, s, atomic, theory, that, inorganic, chemical, compounds, are, composed, of, atoms, combined, in, whole, number, amounts, he, determined, the, exact, elementary, constituents, of, a, large, number, of, compounds, the, results, strongly, supported, proust, s, law, of, definite, proportions, in, discovering, that, atomic, weights, are, not, integer, multiples, of, the, weight, of, hydrogen, berzelius, also, disproved, prout, s, hypothesis, that, elements, are, built, up, from, atoms, of, hydrogen, motivated, by, his, extensive, atomic, weight, determinations, and, in, a, desire, to, aid, his, experiments, he, introduced, the, classical, system, of, chemical, symbols, and, notation, with, his, 1808, publication, l, rbok, i, kemien, in, which, elements, are, abbreviated, to, one, or, two, letters, to, make, a, distinct, symbol, from, their, latin, name, this, system, of, chemical, notation, in, which, the, elements, were, given, simple, written, labels, such, as, o, for, oxygen, or, fe, for, iron, with, proportions, denoted, by, numbers, is, the, same, basic, system, used, today, the, only, difference, is, that, instead, of, the, subscript, number, used, today, e, g, h, 2, o, berzelius, used, a, superscript, h, 2, o, berzelius, is, credited, with, identifying, the, chemical, elements, silicon, selenium, thorium, and, cerium, students, working, in, berzelius, s, laboratory, also, discovered, lithium, and, vanadium, berzelius, developed, the, radical, theory, of, chemical, combination, which, holds, that, reactions, occur, as, stable, groups, of, atoms, called, radicals, are, exchanged, between, molecules, he, believed, that, salts, are, compounds, formed, of, acids, and, bases, and, discovered, that, the, anions, in, acids, were, attracted, to, a, positive, electrode, the, anode, whereas, the, cations, in, a, base, were, attracted, to, a, negative, electrode, the, cathode, berzelius, did, not, believe, in, the, vitalism, theory, but, instead, in, a, regulative, force, which, produced, organization, of, tissues, in, an, organism, berzelius, is, also, credited, with, originating, the, chemical, terms, catalysis, polymer, isomer, and, allotrope, although, his, original, definitions, differ, dramatically, from, modern, usage, for, example, he, coined, the, term, polymer, in, 1833, to, describe, organic, compounds, which, shared, identical, empirical, formulas, but, which, differed, in, overall, molecular, weight, the, larger, of, the, compounds, being, described, as, polymers, of, the, smallest, by, this, long, superseded, pre, structural, definition, glucose, c, 6, h, 12, o, 6, was, viewed, as, a, polymer, of, formaldehyde, ch, 2, o, english, chemist, humphry, davy, was, a, pioneer, in, the, field, of, electrolysis, using, alessandro, volta, s, voltaic, pile, to, split, up, common, compounds, and, thus, isolate, a, series, of, new, elements, he, went, on, to, electrolyse, molten, salts, and, discovered, several, new, metals, especially, sodium, and, potassium, highly, reactive, elements, known, as, the, alkali, metals, potassium, the, first, metal, that, was, isolated, by, electrolysis, was, discovered, in, 1807, by, davy, who, derived, it, from, caustic, potash, koh, before, the, 19th, century, no, distinction, was, made, between, potassium, and, sodium, sodium, was, first, isolated, by, davy, in, the, same, year, by, passing, an, electric, current, through, molten, sodium, hydroxide, naoh, when, davy, heard, that, berzelius, and, pontin, prepared, calcium, amalgam, by, electrolyzing, lime, in, mercury, he, tried, it, himself, davy, was, successful, and, discovered, calcium, in, 1808, by, electrolyzing, a, mixture, of, lime, and, mercuric, oxide, he, worked, with, electrolysis, throughout, his, life, and, in, 1808, he, isolated, magnesium, strontium, and, barium, davy, also, experimented, with, gases, by, inhaling, them, this, experimental, procedure, nearly, proved, fatal, on, several, occasions, but, led, to, the, discovery, of, the, unusual, effects, of, nitrous, oxide, which, came, to, be, known, as, laughing, gas, chlorine, was, discovered, in, 1774, by, swedish, chemist, carl, wilhelm, scheele, who, called, it, dephlogisticated, marine, acid, see, phlogiston, theory, and, mistakenly, thought, it, contained, oxygen, scheele, observed, several, properties, of, chlorine, gas, such, as, its, bleaching, effect, on, litmus, its, deadly, effect, on, insects, its, yellow, green, colour, and, the, similarity, of, its, smell, to, that, of, aqua, regia, however, scheele, was, unable, to, publish, his, findings, at, the, time, in, 1810, chlorine, was, given, its, current, name, by, humphry, davy, derived, from, the, greek, word, for, green, who, insisted, that, chlorine, was, in, fact, an, element, he, also, showed, that, oxygen, could, not, be, obtained, from, the, substance, known, as, oxymuriatic, acid, hcl, solution, this, discovery, overturned, lavoisier, s, definition, of, acids, as, compounds, of, oxygen, davy, was, a, popular, lecturer, and, able, experimenter, french, chemist, joseph, louis, gay, lussac, shared, the, interest, of, lavoisier, and, others, in, the, quantitative, study, of, the, properties, of, gases, from, his, first, major, program, of, research, in, 1801, 1802, he, concluded, that, equal, volumes, of, all, gases, expand, equally, with, the, same, increase, in, temperature, this, conclusion, is, usually, called, charles, s, law, as, gay, lussac, gave, credit, to, jacques, charles, who, had, arrived, at, nearly, the, same, conclusion, in, the, 1780s, but, had, not, published, it, the, law, was, independently, discovered, by, british, natural, philosopher, john, dalton, by, 1801, although, dalton, s, description, was, less, thorough, than, gay, lussac, s, in, 1804, gay, lussac, made, several, daring, ascents, of, over, 7, 000, meters, above, sea, level, in, hydrogen, filled, balloons, a, feat, not, equaled, for, another, 50, years, that, allowed, him, to, investigate, other, aspects, of, gases, not, only, did, he, gather, magnetic, measurements, at, various, altitudes, but, he, also, took, pressure, temperature, and, humidity, measurements, and, samples, of, air, which, he, later, analyzed, chemically, in, 1808, gay, lussac, announced, what, was, probably, his, single, greatest, achievement, from, his, own, and, others, experiments, he, deduced, that, gases, at, constant, temperature, and, pressure, combine, in, simple, numerical, proportions, by, volume, and, the, resulting, product, or, products, if, gases, also, bear, a, simple, proportion, by, volume, to, the, volumes, of, the, reactants, in, other, words, gases, under, equal, conditions, of, temperature, and, pressure, react, with, one, another, in, volume, ratios, of, small, whole, numbers, this, conclusion, subsequently, became, known, as, gay, lussac, s, law, or, the, law, of, combining, volumes, with, his, fellow, professor, at, the, cole, polytechnique, louis, jacques, th, nard, gay, lussac, also, participated, in, early, electrochemical, research, investigating, the, elements, discovered, by, its, means, among, other, achievements, they, decomposed, boric, acid, by, using, fused, potassium, thus, discovering, the, element, boron, the, two, also, took, part, in, contemporary, debates, that, modified, lavoisier, s, definition, of, acids, and, furthered, his, program, of, analyzing, organic, compounds, for, their, oxygen, and, hydrogen, content, the, element, iodine, was, discovered, by, french, chemist, bernard, courtois, in, 1811, courtois, gave, samples, to, his, friends, charles, bernard, desormes, 1777, 1862, and, nicolas, cl, ment, 1779, 1841, to, continue, research, he, also, gave, some, of, the, substance, to, gay, lussac, and, to, physicist, andr, marie, amp, re, on, december, 6, 1813, gay, lussac, announced, that, the, new, substance, was, either, an, element, or, a, compound, of, oxygen, it, was, gay, lussac, who, suggested, the, name, iode, from, the, greek, word, iodes, for, violet, because, of, the, color, of, iodine, vapor, amp, re, had, given, some, of, his, sample, to, humphry, davy, davy, did, some, experiments, on, the, substance, and, noted, its, similarity, to, chlorine, davy, sent, a, letter, dated, december, 10, to, the, royal, society, of, london, stating, that, he, had, identified, a, new, element, arguments, erupted, between, davy, and, gay, lussac, over, who, identified, iodine, first, but, both, scientists, acknowledged, courtois, as, the, first, to, isolate, the, element, in, 1815, humphry, davy, invented, the, davy, lamp, which, allowed, miners, within, coal, mines, to, work, safely, in, the, presence, of, flammable, gases, there, had, been, many, mining, explosions, caused, by, firedamp, or, methane, often, ignited, by, open, flames, of, the, lamps, then, used, by, miners, davy, conceived, of, using, an, iron, gauze, to, enclose, a, lamp, s, flame, and, so, prevent, the, methane, burning, inside, the, lamp, from, passing, out, to, the, general, atmosphere, although, the, idea, of, the, safety, lamp, had, already, been, demonstrated, by, william, reid, clanny, and, by, the, then, unknown, but, later, very, famous, engineer, george, stephenson, davy, s, use, of, wire, gauze, to, prevent, the, spread, of, flame, was, used, by, many, other, inventors, in, their, later, designs, there, was, some, discussion, as, to, whether, davy, had, discovered, the, principles, behind, his, lamp, without, the, help, of, the, work, of, smithson, tennant, but, it, was, generally, agreed, that, the, work, of, both, men, had, been, independent, davy, refused, to, patent, the, lamp, and, its, invention, led, to, him, being, awarded, the, rumford, medal, in, 1816, after, dalton, published, his, atomic, theory, in, 1808, certain, of, his, central, ideas, were, soon, adopted, by, most, chemists, however, uncertainty, persisted, for, half, a, century, about, how, atomic, theory, was, to, be, configured, and, applied, to, concrete, situations, chemists, in, different, countries, developed, several, different, incompatible, atomistic, systems, a, paper, that, suggested, a, way, out, of, this, difficult, situation, was, published, as, early, as, 1811, by, the, italian, physicist, amedeo, avogadro, 1776, 1856, who, hypothesized, that, equal, volumes, of, gases, at, the, same, temperature, and, pressure, contain, equal, numbers, of, molecules, from, which, it, followed, that, relative, molecular, weights, of, any, two, gases, are, the, same, as, the, ratio, of, the, densities, of, the, two, gases, under, the, same, conditions, of, temperature, and, pressure, avogadro, also, reasoned, that, simple, gases, were, not, formed, of, solitary, atoms, but, were, instead, compound, molecules, of, two, or, more, atoms, thus, avogadro, was, able, to, overcome, the, difficulty, that, dalton, and, others, had, encountered, when, gay, lussac, reported, that, above, 100, c, the, volume, of, water, vapor, was, twice, the, volume, of, the, oxygen, used, to, form, it, according, to, avogadro, the, molecule, of, oxygen, had, split, into, two, atoms, in, the, course, of, forming, water, vapor, avogadro, s, hypothesis, was, neglected, for, half, a, century, after, it, was, first, published, many, reasons, for, this, neglect, have, been, cited, including, some, theoretical, problems, such, as, j, ns, jacob, berzelius, s, dualism, which, asserted, that, compounds, are, held, together, by, the, attraction, of, positive, and, negative, electrical, charges, making, it, inconceivable, that, a, molecule, composed, of, two, electrically, similar, atoms, as, in, oxygen, could, exist, an, additional, barrier, to, acceptance, was, the, fact, that, many, chemists, were, reluctant, to, adopt, physical, methods, such, as, vapour, density, determinations, to, solve, their, problems, by, mid, century, however, some, leading, figures, had, begun, to, view, the, chaotic, multiplicity, of, competing, systems, of, atomic, weights, and, molecular, formulas, as, intolerable, moreover, purely, chemical, evidence, began, to, mount, that, suggested, avogadro, s, approach, might, be, right, after, all, during, the, 1850s, younger, chemists, such, as, alexander, williamson, in, england, charles, gerhardt, and, charles, adolphe, wurtz, in, france, and, august, kekul, in, germany, began, to, advocate, reforming, theoretical, chemistry, to, make, it, consistent, with, avogadrian, theory, in, 1825, friedrich, w, hler, and, justus, von, liebig, performed, the, first, confirmed, discovery, and, explanation, of, isomers, earlier, named, by, berzelius, working, with, cyanic, acid, and, fulminic, acid, they, correctly, deduced, that, isomerism, was, caused, by, differing, arrangements, of, atoms, within, a, molecular, structure, in, 1827, william, prout, classified, biomolecules, into, their, modern, groupings, carbohydrates, proteins, and, lipids, after, the, nature, of, combustion, was, settled, a, dispute, about, vitalism, and, the, essential, distinction, between, organic, and, inorganic, substances, began, the, vitalism, question, was, revolutionized, in, 1828, when, friedrich, w, hler, synthesized, urea, thereby, establishing, that, organic, compounds, could, be, produced, from, inorganic, starting, materials, and, disproving, the, theory, of, vitalism, this, opened, a, new, research, field, in, chemistry, and, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, scientists, were, able, to, synthesize, hundreds, of, organic, compounds, the, most, important, among, them, are, mauve, magenta, and, other, synthetic, dyes, as, well, as, the, widely, used, drug, aspirin, the, discovery, of, the, artificial, synthesis, of, urea, contributed, greatly, to, the, theory, of, isomerism, as, the, empirical, chemical, formulas, for, urea, and, ammonium, cyanate, are, identical, see, w, hler, synthesis, in, 1832, friedrich, w, hler, and, justus, von, liebig, discovered, and, explained, functional, groups, and, radicals, in, relation, to, organic, chemistry, as, well, as, first, synthesizing, benzaldehyde, liebig, a, german, chemist, made, major, contributions, to, agricultural, and, biological, chemistry, and, worked, on, the, organization, of, organic, chemistry, being, considered, one, of, its, principal, founders, liebig, is, also, considered, the, father, of, the, fertilizer, industry, for, his, discovery, of, nitrogen, as, an, essential, plant, nutrient, and, his, formulation, of, the, law, of, the, minimum, which, described, the, effect, of, individual, nutrients, on, crops, vladimir, markovnikov, born, in, 1838, was, a, russian, scientist, who, did, most, of, his, work, at, kazan, university, in, russia, at, kazan, he, studied, under, butlerov, in, a, laboratory, better, known, as, the, cradle, of, russian, organic, chemistry, after, which, he, also, studied, chemistry, in, germany, for, two, years, markovnikov, s, contributions, to, the, fields, of, organic, chemistry, included, the, development, of, the, eponymous, markovnikov, s, rule, which, states, that, hydrogen, halides, when, added, to, alkenes, and, alkynes, would, add, in, a, way, that, hydrogens, would, bond, to, the, side, of, the, carbon, with, the, most, hydrogen, substituents, products, in, chemistry, that, follow, this, rule, are, considered, markovnikov, products, and, those, that, did, not, are, considered, anti, markovnikov, products, markovnikov, s, rule, was, an, early, example, of, regioselectivity, in, organic, synthesis, and, the, modern, understanding, of, it, continues, to, be, important, in, the, chemical, industry, where, catalysts, have, been, developed, to, produce, anti, markovnikov, products, a, significant, aspect, of, markovnikov, s, rule, is, that, it, explains, reactivity, based, on, the, structural, arrangement, of, atoms, as, many, chemists, at, the, time, did, not, consider, chemical, formulas, as, representing, physical, arrangement, of, atoms, see, also, radical, theory, in, 1840, germain, hess, proposed, hess, s, law, an, early, statement, of, the, law, of, conservation, of, energy, which, establishes, that, energy, changes, in, a, chemical, process, depend, only, on, the, states, of, the, starting, and, product, materials, and, not, on, the, specific, pathway, taken, between, the, two, states, in, 1847, hermann, kolbe, obtained, acetic, acid, from, completely, inorganic, sources, further, disproving, vitalism, in, 1848, william, thomson, 1st, baron, kelvin, commonly, known, as, lord, kelvin, established, the, concept, of, absolute, zero, the, temperature, at, which, all, molecular, motion, ceases, in, 1849, louis, pasteur, discovered, that, the, racemic, form, of, tartaric, acid, is, a, mixture, of, the, levorotatory, and, dextrotatory, forms, thus, clarifying, the, nature, of, optical, rotation, and, advancing, the, field, of, stereochemistry, in, 1852, august, beer, proposed, beer, s, law, which, explains, the, relationship, between, the, composition, of, a, mixture, and, the, amount, of, light, it, will, absorb, based, partly, on, earlier, work, by, pierre, bouguer, and, johann, heinrich, lambert, it, established, the, analytical, technique, known, as, spectrophotometry, in, 1855, benjamin, silliman, jr, pioneered, methods, of, petroleum, cracking, which, made, the, entire, modern, petrochemical, industry, possible, avogadro, s, hypothesis, began, to, gain, broad, appeal, among, chemists, only, after, his, compatriot, and, fellow, scientist, stanislao, cannizzaro, demonstrated, its, value, in, 1858, two, years, after, avogadro, s, death, cannizzaro, s, chemical, interests, had, originally, centered, on, natural, products, and, on, reactions, of, aromatic, compounds, in, 1853, he, discovered, that, when, benzaldehyde, is, treated, with, concentrated, base, both, benzoic, acid, and, benzyl, alcohol, are, produced, a, phenomenon, known, today, as, the, cannizzaro, reaction, in, his, 1858, pamphlet, cannizzaro, showed, that, a, complete, return, to, the, ideas, of, avogadro, could, be, used, to, construct, a, consistent, and, robust, theoretical, structure, that, fit, nearly, all, of, the, available, empirical, evidence, for, instance, he, pointed, to, evidence, that, suggested, that, not, all, elementary, gases, consist, of, two, atoms, per, molecule, some, were, monatomic, most, were, diatomic, and, a, few, were, even, more, complex, another, point, of, contention, had, been, the, formulas, for, compounds, of, the, alkali, metals, such, as, sodium, and, the, alkaline, earth, metals, such, as, calcium, which, in, view, of, their, striking, chemical, analogies, most, chemists, had, wanted, to, assign, to, the, same, formula, type, cannizzaro, argued, that, placing, these, metals, in, different, categories, had, the, beneficial, result, of, eliminating, certain, anomalies, when, using, their, physical, properties, to, deduce, atomic, weights, unfortunately, cannizzaro, s, pamphlet, was, published, initially, only, in, italian, and, had, little, immediate, impact, the, real, breakthrough, came, with, an, international, chemical, congress, held, in, the, german, town, of, karlsruhe, in, september, 1860, at, which, most, of, the, leading, european, chemists, were, present, the, karlsruhe, congress, had, been, arranged, by, kekul, wurtz, and, a, few, others, who, shared, cannizzaro, s, sense, of, the, direction, chemistry, should, go, speaking, in, french, as, everyone, there, did, cannizzaro, s, eloquence, and, logic, made, an, indelible, impression, on, the, assembled, body, moreover, his, friend, angelo, pavesi, distributed, cannizzaro, s, pamphlet, to, attendees, at, the, end, of, the, meeting, more, than, one, chemist, later, wrote, of, the, decisive, impression, the, reading, of, this, document, provided, for, instance, lothar, meyer, later, wrote, that, on, reading, cannizzaro, s, paper, the, scales, seemed, to, fall, from, my, eyes, cannizzaro, thus, played, a, crucial, role, in, winning, the, battle, for, reform, the, system, advocated, by, him, and, soon, thereafter, adopted, by, most, leading, chemists, is, substantially, identical, to, what, is, still, used, today, in, 1856, sir, william, henry, perkin, age, 18, given, a, challenge, by, his, professor, august, wilhelm, von, hofmann, sought, to, synthesize, quinine, the, anti, malaria, drug, from, coal, tar, in, one, attempt, perkin, oxidized, aniline, using, potassium, dichromate, whose, toluidine, impurities, reacted, with, the, aniline, and, yielded, a, black, solid, suggesting, a, failed, organic, synthesis, cleaning, the, flask, with, alcohol, perkin, noticed, purple, portions, of, the, solution, a, byproduct, of, the, attempt, was, the, first, synthetic, dye, known, as, mauveine, or, perkin, s, mauve, perkin, s, discovery, is, the, foundation, of, the, dye, synthesis, industry, one, of, the, earliest, successful, chemical, industries, german, chemist, august, kekul, von, stradonitz, s, most, important, single, contribution, was, his, structural, theory, of, organic, composition, outlined, in, two, articles, published, in, 1857, and, 1858, and, treated, in, great, detail, in, the, pages, of, his, extraordinarily, popular, lehrbuch, der, organischen, chemie, textbook, of, organic, chemistry, the, first, installment, of, which, appeared, in, 1859, and, gradually, extended, to, four, volumes, kekul, argued, that, tetravalent, carbon, atoms, that, is, carbon, forming, exactly, four, chemical, bonds, could, link, together, to, form, what, he, called, a, carbon, chain, or, a, carbon, skeleton, to, which, other, atoms, with, other, valences, such, as, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and, chlorine, could, join, he, was, convinced, that, it, was, possible, for, the, chemist, to, specify, this, detailed, molecular, architecture, for, at, least, the, simpler, organic, compounds, known, in, his, day, kekul, was, not, the, only, chemist, to, make, such, claims, in, this, era, the, scottish, chemist, archibald, scott, couper, published, a, substantially, similar, theory, nearly, simultaneously, and, the, russian, chemist, aleksandr, butlerov, did, much, to, clarify, and, expand, structure, theory, however, it, was, predominantly, kekul, s, ideas, that, prevailed, in, the, chemical, community, british, chemist, and, physicist, william, crookes, is, noted, for, his, cathode, ray, studies, fundamental, in, the, development, of, atomic, physics, his, researches, on, electrical, discharges, through, a, rarefied, gas, led, him, to, observe, the, dark, space, around, the, cathode, now, called, the, crookes, dark, space, he, demonstrated, that, cathode, rays, travel, in, straight, lines, and, produce, phosphorescence, and, heat, when, they, strike, certain, materials, a, pioneer, of, vacuum, tubes, crookes, invented, the, crookes, tube, an, early, experimental, discharge, tube, with, partial, vacuum, with, which, he, studied, the, behavior, of, cathode, rays, with, the, introduction, of, spectrum, analysis, by, robert, bunsen, and, gustav, kirchhoff, 1859, 1860, crookes, applied, the, new, technique, to, the, study, of, selenium, compounds, bunsen, and, kirchhoff, had, previously, used, spectroscopy, as, a, means, of, chemical, analysis, to, discover, caesium, and, rubidium, in, 1861, crookes, used, this, process, to, discover, thallium, in, some, seleniferous, deposits, he, continued, work, on, that, new, element, isolated, it, studied, its, properties, and, in, 1873, determined, its, atomic, weight, during, his, studies, of, thallium, crookes, discovered, the, principle, of, the, crookes, radiometer, a, device, that, converts, light, radiation, into, rotary, motion, the, principle, of, this, radiometer, has, found, numerous, applications, in, the, development, of, sensitive, measuring, instruments, in, 1862, alexander, parkes, exhibited, parkesine, one, of, the, earliest, synthetic, polymers, at, the, international, exhibition, in, london, this, discovery, formed, the, foundation, of, the, modern, plastics, industry, in, 1864, cato, maximilian, guldberg, and, peter, waage, building, on, claude, louis, berthollet, s, ideas, proposed, the, law, of, mass, action, in, 1865, johann, josef, loschmidt, determined, the, number, of, molecules, in, a, mole, later, named, avogadro, s, number, in, 1865, august, kekul, based, partially, on, the, work, of, loschmidt, and, others, established, the, structure, of, benzene, as, a, six, carbon, ring, with, alternating, single, and, double, bonds, kekul, s, novel, proposal, for, benzene, s, cyclic, structure, was, much, contested, but, was, never, replaced, by, a, superior, theory, this, theory, provided, the, scientific, basis, for, the, dramatic, expansion, of, the, german, chemical, industry, in, the, last, third, of, the, 19th, century, kekul, is, also, famous, for, having, clarified, the, nature, of, aromatic, compounds, which, are, compounds, based, on, the, benzene, molecule, in, 1865, adolf, von, baeyer, began, work, on, indigo, dye, a, milestone, in, modern, industrial, organic, chemistry, which, revolutionized, the, dye, industry, swedish, chemist, and, inventor, alfred, nobel, found, that, when, nitroglycerin, was, incorporated, in, an, absorbent, inert, substance, like, kieselguhr, diatomaceous, earth, it, became, safer, and, more, convenient, to, handle, and, this, mixture, he, patented, in, 1867, as, dynamite, nobel, later, on, combined, nitroglycerin, with, various, nitrocellulose, compounds, similar, to, collodion, but, settled, on, a, more, efficient, recipe, combining, another, nitrate, explosive, and, obtained, a, transparent, jelly, like, substance, which, was, a, more, powerful, explosive, than, dynamite, gelignite, or, blasting, gelatin, as, it, was, named, was, patented, in, 1876, and, was, followed, by, a, host, of, similar, combinations, modified, by, the, addition, of, potassium, nitrate, and, various, other, substances, an, important, breakthrough, in, making, sense, of, the, list, of, known, chemical, elements, as, well, as, in, understanding, the, internal, structure, of, atoms, was, dmitri, mendeleev, s, development, of, the, first, modern, periodic, table, or, the, periodic, classification, of, the, elements, mendeleev, a, russian, chemist, felt, that, there, was, some, type, of, order, to, the, elements, and, he, spent, more, than, thirteen, years, of, his, life, collecting, data, and, assembling, the, concept, initially, with, the, idea, of, resolving, some, of, the, disorder, in, the, field, for, his, students, mendeleev, found, that, when, all, the, known, chemical, elements, were, arranged, in, order, of, increasing, atomic, weight, the, resulting, table, displayed, a, recurring, pattern, or, periodicity, of, properties, within, groups, of, elements, mendeleev, s, law, allowed, him, to, build, up, a, systematic, periodic, table, of, all, the, 66, elements, then, known, based, on, atomic, mass, which, he, published, in, principles, of, chemistry, in, 1869, his, first, periodic, table, was, compiled, on, the, basis, of, arranging, the, elements, in, ascending, order, of, atomic, weight, and, grouping, them, by, similarity, of, properties, mendeleev, had, such, faith, in, the, validity, of, the, periodic, law, that, he, proposed, changes, to, the, generally, accepted, values, for, the, atomic, weight, of, a, few, elements, and, in, his, version, of, the, periodic, table, of, 1871, predicted, the, locations, within, the, table, of, unknown, elements, together, with, their, properties, he, even, predicted, the, likely, properties, of, three, yet, to, be, discovered, elements, which, he, called, ekaboron, eb, ekaaluminium, ea, and, ekasilicon, es, which, proved, to, be, good, predictors, of, the, properties, of, scandium, gallium, and, germanium, respectively, which, each, fill, the, spot, in, the, periodic, table, assigned, by, mendeleev, at, first, the, periodic, system, did, not, raise, interest, among, chemists, however, with, the, discovery, of, the, predicted, elements, notably, gallium, in, 1875, scandium, in, 1879, and, germanium, in, 1886, it, began, to, win, wide, acceptance, the, subsequent, proof, of, many, of, his, predictions, within, his, lifetime, brought, fame, to, mendeleev, as, the, founder, of, the, periodic, law, this, organization, surpassed, earlier, attempts, at, classification, by, alexandre, mile, b, guyer, de, chancourtois, who, published, the, telluric, helix, an, early, three, dimensional, version, of, the, periodic, table, of, the, elements, in, 1862, john, newlands, who, proposed, the, law, of, octaves, a, precursor, to, the, periodic, law, in, 1864, and, lothar, meyer, who, developed, an, early, version, of, the, periodic, table, with, 28, elements, organized, by, valence, in, 1864, mendeleev, s, table, did, not, include, any, of, the, noble, gases, however, which, had, not, yet, been, discovered, gradually, the, periodic, law, and, table, became, the, framework, for, a, great, part, of, chemical, theory, by, the, time, mendeleev, died, in, 1907, he, enjoyed, international, recognition, and, had, received, distinctions, and, awards, from, many, countries, in, 1873, jacobus, henricus, van, t, hoff, and, joseph, achille, le, bel, working, independently, developed, a, model, of, chemical, bonding, that, explained, the, chirality, experiments, of, pasteur, and, provided, a, physical, cause, for, optical, activity, in, chiral, compounds, van, t, hoff, s, publication, called, voorstel, tot, uitbreiding, der, tegenwoordige, in, de, scheikunde, gebruikte, structuurformules, in, de, ruimte, etc, proposal, for, the, development, of, 3, dimensional, chemical, structural, formulae, and, consisting, of, twelve, pages, of, text, and, one, page, of, diagrams, gave, the, impetus, to, the, development, of, stereochemistry, the, concept, of, the, asymmetrical, carbon, atom, dealt, with, in, this, publication, supplied, an, explanation, of, the, occurrence, of, numerous, isomers, inexplicable, by, means, of, the, then, current, structural, formulae, at, the, same, time, he, pointed, out, the, existence, of, relationship, between, optical, activity, and, the, presence, of, an, asymmetrical, carbon, atom, american, mathematical, physicist, j, willard, gibbs, s, work, on, the, applications, of, thermodynamics, was, instrumental, in, transforming, physical, chemistry, into, a, rigorous, deductive, science, during, the, years, from, 1876, to, 1878, gibbs, worked, on, the, principles, of, thermodynamics, applying, them, to, the, complex, processes, involved, in, chemical, reactions, he, discovered, the, concept, of, chemical, potential, or, the, fuel, that, makes, chemical, reactions, work, in, 1876, he, published, his, most, famous, contribution, on, the, equilibrium, of, heterogeneous, substances, a, compilation, of, his, work, on, thermodynamics, and, physical, chemistry, which, laid, out, the, concept, of, free, energy, to, explain, the, physical, basis, of, chemical, equilibria, in, these, essays, were, the, beginnings, of, gibbs, theories, of, phases, of, matter, he, considered, each, state, of, matter, a, phase, and, each, substance, a, component, gibbs, took, all, of, the, variables, involved, in, a, chemical, reaction, temperature, pressure, energy, volume, and, entropy, and, included, them, in, one, simple, equation, known, as, gibbs, phase, rule, within, this, paper, was, perhaps, his, most, outstanding, contribution, the, introduction, of, the, concept, of, free, energy, now, universally, called, gibbs, free, energy, in, his, honor, the, gibbs, free, energy, relates, the, tendency, of, a, physical, or, chemical, system, to, simultaneously, lower, its, energy, and, increase, its, disorder, or, entropy, in, a, spontaneous, natural, process, gibbs, s, approach, allows, a, researcher, to, calculate, the, change, in, free, energy, in, the, process, such, as, in, a, chemical, reaction, and, how, fast, it, will, happen, since, virtually, all, chemical, processes, and, many, physical, ones, involve, such, changes, his, work, has, significantly, impacted, both, the, theoretical, and, experiential, aspects, of, these, sciences, in, 1877, ludwig, boltzmann, established, statistical, derivations, of, many, important, physical, and, chemical, concepts, including, entropy, and, distributions, of, molecular, velocities, in, the, gas, phase, together, with, boltzmann, and, james, clerk, maxwell, gibbs, created, a, new, branch, of, theoretical, physics, called, statistical, mechanics, a, term, that, he, coined, explaining, the, laws, of, thermodynamics, as, consequences, of, the, statistical, properties, of, large, ensembles, of, particles, gibbs, also, worked, on, the, application, of, maxwell, s, equations, to, problems, in, physical, optics, gibbs, s, derivation, of, the, phenomenological, laws, of, thermodynamics, from, the, statistical, properties, of, systems, with, many, particles, was, presented, in, his, highly, influential, textbook, elementary, principles, in, statistical, mechanics, published, in, 1902, a, year, before, his, death, in, that, work, gibbs, reviewed, the, relationship, between, the, laws, of, thermodynamics, and, the, statistical, theory, of, molecular, motions, the, overshooting, of, the, original, function, by, partial, sums, of, fourier, series, at, points, of, discontinuity, is, known, as, the, gibbs, phenomenon, german, engineer, carl, von, linde, s, invention, of, a, continuous, process, of, liquefying, gases, in, large, quantities, formed, a, basis, for, the, modern, technology, of, refrigeration, and, provided, both, impetus, and, means, for, conducting, scientific, research, at, low, temperatures, and, very, high, vacuums, he, developed, a, dimethyl, ether, refrigerator, 1874, and, an, ammonia, refrigerator, 1876, though, other, refrigeration, units, had, been, developed, earlier, linde, s, were, the, first, to, be, designed, with, the, aim, of, precise, calculations, of, efficiency, in, 1895, he, set, up, a, large, scale, plant, for, the, production, of, liquid, air, six, years, later, he, developed, a, method, for, separating, pure, liquid, oxygen, from, liquid, air, that, resulted, in, widespread, industrial, conversion, to, processes, utilizing, oxygen, e, g, in, steel, manufacture, he, founded, the, linde, plc, the, world, s, largest, industrial, gas, company, by, market, share, and, revenue, in, 1883, svante, arrhenius, developed, an, ion, theory, to, explain, conductivity, in, electrolytes, in, 1884, jacobus, henricus, van, t, hoff, published, tudes, de, dynamique, chimique, studies, in, dynamic, chemistry, a, seminal, study, on, chemical, kinetics, in, this, work, van, t, hoff, entered, for, the, first, time, the, field, of, physical, chemistry, of, great, importance, was, his, development, of, the, general, thermodynamic, relationship, between, the, heat, of, conversion, and, the, displacement, of, the, equilibrium, as, a, result, of, temperature, variation, at, constant, volume, the, equilibrium, in, a, system, will, tend, to, shift, in, such, a, direction, as, to, oppose, the, temperature, change, which, is, imposed, upon, the, system, thus, lowering, the, temperature, results, in, heat, development, while, increasing, the, temperature, results, in, heat, absorption, this, principle, of, mobile, equilibrium, was, subsequently, 1885, put, in, a, general, form, by, henry, louis, le, chatelier, who, extended, the, principle, to, include, compensation, by, change, of, volume, for, imposed, pressure, changes, the, van, t, hoff, le, chatelier, principle, or, simply, le, chatelier, s, principle, explains, the, response, of, dynamic, chemical, equilibria, to, external, stresses, in, 1884, hermann, emil, fischer, proposed, the, structure, of, purine, a, key, structure, in, many, biomolecules, which, he, later, synthesized, in, 1898, he, also, began, work, on, the, chemistry, of, glucose, and, related, sugars, in, 1885, eugen, goldstein, named, the, cathode, ray, later, discovered, to, be, composed, of, electrons, and, the, canal, ray, later, discovered, to, be, positive, hydrogen, ions, that, had, been, stripped, of, their, electrons, in, a, cathode, ray, tube, these, would, later, be, named, protons, the, year, 1885, also, saw, the, publishing, of, j, h, van, t, hoff, s, l, quilibre, chimique, dans, les, syst, mes, gazeux, ou, dissous, i, tat, dilu, chemical, equilibria, in, gaseous, systems, or, strongly, diluted, solutions, which, dealt, with, this, theory, of, dilute, solutions, here, he, demonstrated, that, the, osmotic, pressure, in, solutions, which, are, sufficiently, dilute, is, proportionate, to, the, concentration, and, the, absolute, temperature, so, that, this, pressure, can, be, represented, by, a, formula, that, only, deviates, from, the, formula, for, gas, pressure, by, a, coefficient, i, he, also, determined, the, value, of, i, by, various, methods, for, example, by, means, of, the, vapor, pressure, and, fran, ois, marie, raoult, s, results, on, the, lowering, of, the, freezing, point, thus, van, t, hoff, was, able, to, prove, that, thermodynamic, laws, are, not, only, valid, for, gases, but, also, for, dilute, solutions, his, pressure, laws, given, general, validity, by, the, electrolytic, dissociation, theory, of, arrhenius, 1884, 1887, the, first, foreigner, who, came, to, work, with, him, in, amsterdam, 1888, are, considered, the, most, comprehensive, and, important, in, the, realm, of, natural, sciences, in, 1893, alfred, werner, discovered, the, octahedral, structure, of, cobalt, complexes, thus, establishing, the, field, of, coordination, chemistry, the, most, celebrated, discoveries, of, scottish, chemist, william, ramsay, were, made, in, inorganic, chemistry, ramsay, was, intrigued, by, the, british, physicist, john, strutt, 3rd, baron, rayleigh, s, 1892, discovery, that, the, atomic, weight, of, nitrogen, found, in, chemical, compounds, was, lower, than, that, of, nitrogen, found, in, the, atmosphere, he, ascribed, this, discrepancy, to, a, light, gas, included, in, chemical, compounds, of, nitrogen, while, ramsay, suspected, a, hitherto, undiscovered, heavy, gas, in, atmospheric, nitrogen, using, two, different, methods, to, remove, all, known, gases, from, air, ramsay, and, lord, rayleigh, were, able, to, announce, in, 1894, that, they, had, found, a, monatomic, chemically, inert, gaseous, element, that, constituted, nearly, 1, percent, of, the, atmosphere, they, named, it, argon, the, following, year, ramsay, liberated, another, inert, gas, from, a, mineral, called, cleveite, this, proved, to, be, helium, previously, known, only, in, the, solar, spectrum, in, his, book, the, gases, of, the, atmosphere, 1896, ramsay, showed, that, the, positions, of, helium, and, argon, in, the, periodic, table, of, elements, indicated, that, at, least, three, more, noble, gases, might, exist, in, 1898, ramsay, and, the, british, chemist, morris, w, travers, isolated, these, elements, called, neon, krypton, and, xenon, from, air, and, brought, them, to, a, liquid, state, at, low, temperature, and, high, pressure, sir, william, ramsay, worked, with, frederick, soddy, to, demonstrate, in, 1903, that, alpha, particles, helium, nuclei, were, continually, produced, during, the, radioactive, decay, of, a, sample, of, radium, ramsay, was, awarded, the, 1904, nobel, prize, for, chemistry, in, recognition, of, services, in, the, discovery, of, the, inert, gaseous, elements, in, the, air, and, his, determination, of, their, place, in, the, periodic, system, in, 1897, j, j, thomson, discovered, the, electron, using, the, cathode, ray, tube, in, 1898, wilhelm, wien, demonstrated, that, canal, rays, streams, of, positive, ions, can, be, deflected, by, magnetic, fields, and, that, the, amount, of, deflection, is, proportional, to, the, mass, to, charge, ratio, this, discovery, would, lead, to, the, analytical, technique, known, as, mass, spectrometry, in, 1912, marie, sk, odowska, curie, was, a, polish, born, french, physicist, and, chemist, who, is, famous, for, her, pioneering, research, on, radioactivity, she, and, her, husband, are, considered, to, have, laid, the, cornerstone, of, the, nuclear, age, with, their, research, on, radioactivity, marie, was, fascinated, with, the, work, of, henri, becquerel, a, french, physicist, who, discovered, in, 1896, that, uranium, casts, off, rays, similar, to, the, x, rays, discovered, by, wilhelm, r, ntgen, marie, curie, began, studying, uranium, in, late, 1897, and, theorized, according, to, a, 1904, article, she, wrote, for, century, magazine, that, the, emission, of, rays, by, the, compounds, of, uranium, is, a, property, of, the, metal, itself, that, it, is, an, atomic, property, of, the, element, uranium, independent, of, its, chemical, or, physical, state, curie, took, becquerel, s, work, a, few, steps, further, conducting, her, own, experiments, on, uranium, rays, she, discovered, that, the, rays, remained, constant, no, matter, the, condition, or, form, of, the, uranium, the, rays, she, theorized, came, from, the, element, s, atomic, structure, this, revolutionary, idea, created, the, field, of, atomic, physics, and, the, curies, coined, the, word, radioactivity, to, describe, the, phenomenon, pierre, and, marie, further, explored, radioactivity, by, working, to, separate, the, substances, in, uranium, ores, and, then, using, the, electrometer, to, make, radiation, measurements, to, trace, the, minute, amount, of, unknown, radioactive, element, among, the, fractions, that, resulted, working, with, the, mineral, pitchblende, the, pair, discovered, a, new, radioactive, element, in, 1898, they, named, the, element, polonium, after, marie, s, native, country, of, poland, on, december, 21, 1898, the, curies, detected, the, presence, of, another, radioactive, material, in, the, pitchblende, they, presented, this, finding, to, the, french, academy, of, sciences, on, december, 26, proposing, that, the, new, element, be, called, radium, the, curies, then, went, to, work, isolating, polonium, and, radium, from, naturally, occurring, compounds, to, prove, that, they, were, new, elements, in, 1902, the, curies, announced, that, they, had, produced, a, decigram, of, pure, radium, demonstrating, its, existence, as, a, unique, chemical, element, while, it, took, three, years, for, them, to, isolate, radium, they, were, never, able, to, isolate, polonium, along, with, the, discovery, of, two, new, elements, and, finding, techniques, for, isolating, radioactive, isotopes, curie, oversaw, the, world, s, first, studies, into, the, treatment, of, neoplasms, using, radioactive, isotopes, with, henri, becquerel, and, her, husband, pierre, curie, she, was, awarded, the, 1903, nobel, prize, for, physics, she, was, the, sole, winner, of, the, 1911, nobel, prize, for, chemistry, she, was, the, first, woman, to, win, a, nobel, prize, and, she, is, the, only, woman, to, win, the, award, in, two, different, fields, while, working, with, marie, to, extract, pure, substances, from, ores, an, undertaking, that, really, required, industrial, resources, but, that, they, achieved, in, relatively, primitive, conditions, pierre, himself, concentrated, on, the, physical, study, including, luminous, and, chemical, effects, of, the, new, radiations, through, the, action, of, magnetic, fields, on, the, rays, given, out, by, the, radium, he, proved, the, existence, of, particles, that, were, electrically, positive, negative, and, neutral, these, ernest, rutherford, was, afterward, to, call, alpha, beta, and, gamma, rays, pierre, then, studied, these, radiations, by, calorimetry, and, also, observed, the, physiological, effects, of, radium, thus, opening, the, way, to, radium, therapy, among, pierre, curie, s, discoveries, were, that, ferromagnetic, substances, exhibited, a, critical, temperature, transition, above, which, the, substances, lost, their, ferromagnetic, behavior, this, is, known, as, the, curie, point, he, was, elected, to, the, academy, of, sciences, 1905, having, in, 1903, jointly, with, marie, received, the, royal, society, s, prestigious, davy, medal, and, jointly, with, her, and, becquerel, the, nobel, prize, for, physics, he, was, run, over, by, a, carriage, in, the, rue, dauphine, in, paris, in, 1906, and, died, instantly, his, complete, works, were, published, in, 1908, new, zealand, born, chemist, and, physicist, ernest, rutherford, is, considered, to, be, the, father, of, nuclear, physics, rutherford, is, best, known, for, devising, the, names, alpha, beta, and, gamma, to, classify, various, forms, of, radioactive, rays, which, were, poorly, understood, at, his, time, alpha, and, beta, rays, are, particle, beams, while, gamma, rays, are, a, form, of, high, energy, electromagnetic, radiation, rutherford, deflected, alpha, rays, with, both, electric, and, magnetic, fields, in, 1903, working, with, frederick, soddy, rutherford, explained, that, radioactivity, is, due, to, the, transmutation, of, elements, now, known, to, involve, nuclear, reactions, he, also, observed, that, the, intensity, of, radioactivity, of, a, radioactive, element, decreases, over, a, unique, and, regular, amount, of, time, until, a, point, of, stability, and, he, named, the, halving, time, the, half, life, in, 1901, and, 1902, he, worked, with, frederick, soddy, to, prove, that, atoms, of, one, radioactive, element, would, spontaneously, turn, into, another, by, expelling, a, piece, of, the, atom, at, high, velocity, in, 1906, at, the, university, of, manchester, rutherford, oversaw, an, experiment, conducted, by, his, students, hans, geiger, known, for, the, geiger, counter, and, ernest, marsden, in, the, geiger, marsden, experiment, a, beam, of, alpha, particles, generated, by, the, radioactive, decay, of, radon, was, directed, normally, onto, a, sheet, of, very, thin, gold, foil, in, an, evacuated, chamber, under, the, prevailing, plum, pudding, model, the, alpha, particles, should, all, have, passed, through, the, foil, and, hit, the, detector, screen, or, have, been, deflected, by, at, most, a, few, degrees, however, the, actual, results, surprised, rutherford, although, many, of, the, alpha, particles, did, pass, through, as, expected, many, others, were, deflected, at, small, angles, while, others, were, reflected, back, to, the, alpha, source, they, observed, that, a, very, small, percentage, of, particles, were, deflected, through, angles, much, larger, than, 90, degrees, the, gold, foil, experiment, showed, large, deflections, for, a, small, fraction, of, incident, particles, rutherford, realized, that, because, some, of, the, alpha, particles, were, deflected, or, reflected, the, atom, had, a, concentrated, centre, of, positive, charge, and, of, relatively, large, mass, rutherford, later, termed, this, positive, center, the, atomic, nucleus, the, alpha, particles, had, either, hit, the, positive, centre, directly, or, passed, by, it, close, enough, to, be, affected, by, its, positive, charge, since, many, other, particles, passed, through, the, gold, foil, the, positive, centre, would, have, to, be, a, relatively, small, size, compared, to, the, rest, of, the, atom, meaning, that, the, atom, is, mostly, open, space, from, his, results, rutherford, developed, a, model, of, the, atom, that, was, similar, to, the, solar, system, known, as, the, rutherford, model, like, planets, electrons, orbited, a, central, sun, like, nucleus, for, his, work, with, radiation, and, the, atomic, nucleus, rutherford, received, the, 1908, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, in, 1903, mikhail, tsvet, invented, chromatography, an, important, analytic, technique, in, 1904, hantaro, nagaoka, proposed, an, early, nuclear, model, of, the, atom, where, electrons, orbit, a, dense, massive, nucleus, in, 1905, fritz, haber, and, carl, bosch, developed, the, haber, process, for, making, ammonia, a, milestone, in, industrial, chemistry, with, deep, consequences, in, agriculture, the, haber, process, or, haber, bosch, process, combined, nitrogen, and, hydrogen, to, form, ammonia, in, industrial, quantities, for, the, production, of, fertilizer, and, munitions, the, food, production, for, half, the, world, s, current, population, depends, on, this, method, for, producing, fertilizer, haber, along, with, max, born, proposed, the, born, haber, cycle, as, a, method, for, evaluating, the, lattice, energy, of, an, ionic, solid, haber, has, also, been, described, as, the, father, of, chemical, warfare, for, his, work, developing, and, deploying, chlorine, and, other, poisonous, gases, during, world, war, i, in, 1905, albert, einstein, explained, brownian, motion, in, a, way, that, definitively, proved, atomic, theory, leo, baekeland, invented, bakelite, one, of, the, first, commercially, successful, plastics, in, 1909, american, physicist, robert, andrews, millikan, who, had, studied, in, europe, under, walther, nernst, and, max, planck, measured, the, charge, of, individual, electrons, with, unprecedented, accuracy, through, the, oil, drop, experiment, in, which, he, measured, the, electric, charges, on, tiny, falling, water, and, later, oil, droplets, his, study, established, that, any, particular, droplet, s, electrical, charge, is, a, multiple, of, a, definite, fundamental, value, the, electron, s, charge, and, thus, a, confirmation, that, all, electrons, have, the, same, charge, and, mass, beginning, in, 1912, he, spent, several, years, investigating, and, finally, proving, albert, einstein, s, proposed, linear, relationship, between, energy, and, frequency, and, providing, the, first, direct, photoelectric, support, for, the, planck, constant, in, 1923, millikan, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, for, physics, in, 1909, s, p, l, s, rensen, invented, the, ph, concept, and, developed, methods, for, measuring, acidity, in, 1911, antonius, van, den, broek, proposed, the, idea, that, the, elements, on, the, periodic, table, are, more, properly, organized, by, positive, nuclear, charge, rather, than, atomic, weight, in, 1911, the, first, solvay, conference, was, held, in, brussels, bringing, together, most, of, the, most, prominent, scientists, of, the, day, in, 1912, william, henry, bragg, and, william, lawrence, bragg, proposed, bragg, s, law, and, established, the, field, of, x, ray, crystallography, an, important, tool, for, elucidating, the, crystal, structure, of, substances, in, 1912, peter, debye, used, the, concept, of, a, molecular, dipole, to, describe, asymmetric, charge, distribution, in, some, molecules, otto, hahn, was, a, german, chemist, and, a, pioneer, in, the, fields, of, radioactivity, and, radiochemistry, he, played, a, leading, role, in, the, discovery, of, nuclear, fission, and, established, nuclear, chemistry, as, a, scientic, field, hahn, lise, meitner, and, fritz, strassmann, discovered, radioactive, isotopes, of, radium, thorium, protactinium, and, uranium, he, also, discovered, the, phenomena, of, atomic, recoil, and, nuclear, isomerism, and, pioneered, rubidium, strontium, dating, in, 1938, hahn, meitner, and, strassmann, discovered, nuclear, fission, in, their, second, publication, on, nuclear, fission, in, february, 1939, hahn, and, strassmann, predicted, the, existence, and, liberation, of, additional, neutrons, during, the, fission, process, opening, up, the, possibility, of, a, nuclear, chain, reaction, hahn, received, the, 1944, nobel, prize, for, chemistry, for, the, discoveries, nuclear, fission, was, the, basis, for, nuclear, reactors, and, nuclear, weapons, in, 1913, niels, bohr, a, danish, physicist, introduced, the, concepts, of, quantum, mechanics, to, atomic, structure, by, proposing, what, is, now, known, as, the, bohr, model, of, the, atom, where, electrons, exist, only, in, strictly, defined, circular, orbits, around, the, nucleus, similar, to, rungs, on, a, ladder, the, bohr, model, is, a, planetary, model, in, which, the, negatively, charged, electrons, orbit, a, small, positively, charged, nucleus, similar, to, the, planets, orbiting, the, sun, except, that, the, orbits, are, not, planar, the, gravitational, force, of, the, solar, system, is, mathematically, akin, to, the, attractive, coulomb, electrical, force, between, the, positively, charged, nucleus, and, the, negatively, charged, electrons, in, the, bohr, model, however, electrons, orbit, the, nucleus, in, orbits, that, have, a, set, size, and, energy, the, energy, levels, are, said, to, be, quantized, which, means, that, only, certain, orbits, with, certain, radii, are, allowed, orbits, in, between, simply, do, not, exist, the, energy, of, the, orbit, is, related, to, its, size, that, is, the, lowest, energy, is, found, in, the, smallest, orbit, bohr, also, postulated, that, electromagnetic, radiation, is, absorbed, or, emitted, when, an, electron, moves, from, one, orbit, to, another, because, only, certain, electron, orbits, are, permitted, the, emission, of, light, accompanying, a, jump, of, an, electron, from, an, excited, energy, state, to, ground, state, produces, a, unique, emission, spectrum, for, each, element, bohr, later, received, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, this, work, niels, bohr, also, worked, on, the, principle, of, complementarity, which, states, that, an, electron, can, be, interpreted, in, two, mutually, exclusive, and, valid, ways, electrons, can, be, interpreted, as, wave, or, particle, models, his, hypothesis, was, that, an, incoming, particle, would, strike, the, nucleus, and, create, an, excited, compound, nucleus, this, formed, the, basis, of, his, liquid, drop, model, and, later, provided, a, theory, base, for, nuclear, fission, after, its, discovery, by, chemists, otto, hahn, and, fritz, strassman, and, explanation, and, naming, by, physicists, lise, meitner, and, otto, frisch, in, 1913, henry, moseley, working, from, van, den, broek, s, earlier, idea, introduced, the, concept, of, atomic, number, to, fix, some, inadequacies, of, mendeleev, s, periodic, table, which, had, been, based, on, atomic, weight, the, peak, of, frederick, soddy, s, career, in, radiochemistry, was, in, 1913, with, his, formulation, of, the, concept, of, isotopes, which, stated, that, certain, elements, exist, in, two, or, more, forms, which, have, different, atomic, weights, but, which, are, indistinguishable, chemically, he, is, remembered, for, proving, the, existence, of, isotopes, of, certain, radioactive, elements, and, is, also, credited, along, with, others, with, the, discovery, of, the, element, protactinium, in, 1917, in, 1913, j, j, thomson, expanded, on, the, work, of, wien, by, showing, that, charged, subatomic, particles, can, be, separated, by, their, mass, to, charge, ratio, a, technique, known, as, mass, spectrometry, american, physical, chemist, gilbert, n, lewis, laid, the, foundation, of, valence, bond, theory, he, was, instrumental, in, developing, a, bonding, theory, based, on, the, number, of, electrons, in, the, outermost, valence, shell, of, the, atom, in, 1902, while, lewis, was, trying, to, explain, valence, to, his, students, he, depicted, atoms, as, constructed, of, a, concentric, series, of, cubes, with, electrons, at, each, corner, this, cubic, atom, explained, the, eight, groups, in, the, periodic, table, and, represented, his, idea, that, chemical, bonds, are, formed, by, electron, transference, to, give, each, atom, a, complete, set, of, eight, outer, electrons, an, octet, lewis, s, theory, of, chemical, bonding, continued, to, evolve, and, in, 1916, he, published, his, seminal, article, the, atom, of, the, molecule, which, suggested, that, a, chemical, bond, is, a, pair, of, electrons, shared, by, two, atoms, lewis, s, model, equated, the, classical, chemical, bond, with, the, sharing, of, a, pair, of, electrons, between, the, two, bonded, atoms, lewis, introduced, the, electron, dot, diagrams, in, this, paper, to, symbolize, the, electronic, structures, of, atoms, and, molecules, now, known, as, lewis, structures, they, are, discussed, in, virtually, every, introductory, chemistry, book, shortly, after, the, publication, of, his, 1916, paper, lewis, became, involved, with, military, research, he, did, not, return, to, the, subject, of, chemical, bonding, until, 1923, when, he, masterfully, summarized, his, model, in, a, short, monograph, entitled, valence, and, the, structure, of, atoms, and, molecules, his, renewal, of, interest, in, this, subject, was, largely, stimulated, by, the, activities, of, the, american, chemist, and, general, electric, researcher, irving, langmuir, who, between, 1919, and, 1921, popularized, and, elaborated, lewis, s, model, langmuir, subsequently, introduced, the, term, covalent, bond, in, 1921, otto, stern, and, walther, gerlach, established, the, concept, of, quantum, mechanical, spin, in, subatomic, particles, for, cases, where, no, sharing, was, involved, lewis, in, 1923, developed, the, electron, pair, theory, of, acids, and, base, lewis, redefined, an, acid, as, any, atom, or, molecule, with, an, incomplete, octet, that, was, thus, capable, of, accepting, electrons, from, another, atom, bases, were, of, course, electron, donors, his, theory, is, known, as, the, concept, of, lewis, acids, and, bases, in, 1923, g, n, lewis, and, merle, randall, published, thermodynamics, and, the, free, energy, of, chemical, substances, first, modern, treatise, on, chemical, thermodynamics, the, 1920s, saw, a, rapid, adoption, and, application, of, lewis, s, model, of, the, electron, pair, bond, in, the, fields, of, organic, and, coordination, chemistry, in, organic, chemistry, this, was, primarily, due, to, the, efforts, of, the, british, chemists, arthur, lapworth, robert, robinson, thomas, lowry, and, christopher, ingold, while, in, coordination, chemistry, lewis, s, bonding, model, was, promoted, through, the, efforts, of, the, american, chemist, maurice, huggins, and, the, british, chemist, nevil, sidgwick, in, 1924, french, quantum, physicist, louis, de, broglie, published, his, thesis, in, which, he, introduced, a, revolutionary, theory, of, electron, waves, based, on, wave, particle, duality, in, his, time, the, wave, and, particle, interpretations, of, light, and, matter, were, seen, as, being, at, odds, with, one, another, but, de, broglie, suggested, that, these, seemingly, different, characteristics, were, instead, the, same, behavior, observed, from, different, perspectives, that, particles, can, behave, like, waves, and, waves, radiation, can, behave, like, particles, broglie, s, proposal, offered, an, explanation, of, the, restricted, motion, of, electrons, within, the, atom, the, first, publications, of, broglie, s, idea, of, matter, waves, had, drawn, little, attention, from, other, physicists, but, a, copy, of, his, doctoral, thesis, chanced, to, reach, einstein, whose, response, was, enthusiastic, einstein, stressed, the, importance, of, broglie, s, work, both, explicitly, and, by, building, further, on, it, in, 1925, austrian, born, physicist, wolfgang, pauli, developed, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, which, states, that, no, two, electrons, around, a, single, nucleus, in, an, atom, can, occupy, the, same, quantum, state, simultaneously, as, described, by, four, quantum, numbers, pauli, made, major, contributions, to, quantum, mechanics, and, quantum, field, theory, he, was, awarded, the, 1945, nobel, prize, for, physics, for, his, discovery, of, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, as, well, as, solid, state, physics, and, he, successfully, hypothesized, the, existence, of, the, neutrino, in, addition, to, his, original, work, he, wrote, masterful, syntheses, of, several, areas, of, physical, theory, that, are, considered, classics, of, scientific, literature, in, 1926, at, the, age, of, 39, austrian, theoretical, physicist, erwin, schr, dinger, produced, the, papers, that, gave, the, foundations, of, quantum, wave, mechanics, in, those, papers, he, described, his, partial, differential, equation, that, is, the, basic, equation, of, quantum, mechanics, and, bears, the, same, relation, to, the, mechanics, of, the, atom, as, newton, s, equations, of, motion, bear, to, planetary, astronomy, adopting, a, proposal, made, by, louis, de, broglie, in, 1924, that, particles, of, matter, have, a, dual, nature, and, in, some, situations, act, like, waves, schr, dinger, introduced, a, theory, describing, the, behaviour, of, such, a, system, by, a, wave, equation, that, is, now, known, as, the, schr, dinger, equation, the, solutions, to, schr, dinger, s, equation, unlike, the, solutions, to, newton, s, equations, are, wave, functions, that, can, only, be, related, to, the, probable, occurrence, of, physical, events, the, readily, visualized, sequence, of, events, of, the, planetary, orbits, of, newton, is, in, quantum, mechanics, replaced, by, the, more, abstract, notion, of, probability, this, aspect, of, the, quantum, theory, made, schr, dinger, and, several, other, physicists, profoundly, unhappy, and, he, devoted, much, of, his, later, life, to, formulating, philosophical, objections, to, the, generally, accepted, interpretation, of, the, theory, that, he, had, done, so, much, to, create, german, theoretical, physicist, werner, heisenberg, was, one, of, the, key, creators, of, quantum, mechanics, in, 1925, heisenberg, discovered, a, way, to, formulate, quantum, mechanics, in, terms, of, matrices, for, that, discovery, he, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, for, physics, for, 1932, in, 1927, he, published, his, uncertainty, principle, upon, which, he, built, his, philosophy, and, for, which, he, is, best, known, heisenberg, was, able, to, demonstrate, that, if, you, were, studying, an, electron, in, an, atom, you, could, say, where, it, was, the, electron, s, location, or, where, it, was, going, the, electron, s, velocity, but, it, was, impossible, to, express, both, at, the, same, time, he, also, made, important, contributions, to, the, theories, of, the, hydrodynamics, of, turbulent, flows, the, atomic, nucleus, ferromagnetism, cosmic, rays, and, subatomic, particles, and, he, was, instrumental, in, planning, the, first, west, german, nuclear, reactor, at, karlsruhe, together, with, a, research, reactor, in, munich, in, 1957, considerable, controversy, surrounds, his, work, on, atomic, research, during, world, war, ii, some, view, the, birth, of, quantum, chemistry, in, the, discovery, of, the, schr, dinger, equation, and, its, application, to, the, hydrogen, atom, in, 1926, however, the, 1927, article, of, walter, heitler, and, fritz, london, is, often, recognised, as, the, first, milestone, in, the, history, of, quantum, chemistry, this, is, the, first, application, of, quantum, mechanics, to, the, diatomic, hydrogen, molecule, and, thus, to, the, phenomenon, of, the, chemical, bond, in, the, following, years, much, progress, was, accomplished, by, edward, teller, robert, s, mulliken, max, born, j, robert, oppenheimer, linus, pauling, erich, h, ckel, douglas, hartree, and, vladimir, aleksandrovich, fock, to, cite, a, few, still, skepticism, remained, as, to, the, general, power, of, quantum, mechanics, applied, to, complex, chemical, systems, the, situation, around, 1930, is, described, by, paul, dirac, the, underlying, physical, laws, necessary, for, the, mathematical, theory, of, a, large, part, of, physics, and, the, whole, of, chemistry, are, thus, completely, known, and, the, difficulty, is, only, that, the, exact, application, of, these, laws, leads, to, equations, much, too, complicated, to, be, soluble, it, therefore, becomes, desirable, that, approximate, practical, methods, of, applying, quantum, mechanics, should, be, developed, which, can, lead, to, an, explanation, of, the, main, features, of, complex, atomic, systems, without, too, much, computation, hence, the, quantum, mechanical, methods, developed, in, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, are, often, referred, to, as, theoretical, molecular, or, atomic, physics, to, underline, the, fact, that, they, were, more, the, application, of, quantum, mechanics, to, chemistry, and, spectroscopy, than, answers, to, chemically, relevant, questions, in, 1951, a, milestone, article, in, quantum, chemistry, is, the, seminal, paper, of, clemens, c, j, roothaan, on, roothaan, equations, it, opened, the, avenue, to, the, solution, of, the, self, consistent, field, equations, for, small, molecules, like, hydrogen, or, nitrogen, those, computations, were, performed, with, the, help, of, tables, of, integrals, which, were, computed, on, the, most, advanced, computers, of, the, time, in, the, 1940s, many, physicists, turned, from, molecular, or, atomic, physics, to, nuclear, physics, like, j, robert, oppenheimer, or, edward, teller, glenn, t, seaborg, was, an, american, nuclear, chemist, best, known, for, his, work, on, isolating, and, identifying, transuranium, elements, those, heavier, than, uranium, he, shared, the, 1951, nobel, prize, for, chemistry, with, edwin, mattison, mcmillan, for, their, independent, discoveries, of, transuranium, elements, seaborgium, was, named, in, his, honour, making, him, the, only, person, along, with, albert, einstein, and, yuri, oganessian, for, whom, a, chemical, element, was, named, during, his, lifetime, by, the, mid, 20th, century, in, principle, the, integration, of, physics, and, chemistry, was, extensive, with, chemical, properties, explained, as, the, result, of, the, electronic, structure, of, the, atom, linus, pauling, s, book, on, the, nature, of, the, chemical, bond, used, the, principles, of, quantum, mechanics, to, deduce, bond, angles, in, ever, more, complicated, molecules, however, though, some, principles, deduced, from, quantum, mechanics, were, able, to, predict, qualitatively, some, chemical, features, for, biologically, relevant, molecules, they, were, till, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, more, a, collection, of, rules, observations, and, recipes, than, rigorous, ab, initio, quantitative, methods, this, heuristic, approach, triumphed, in, 1953, when, james, watson, and, francis, crick, deduced, the, double, helical, structure, of, dna, by, constructing, models, constrained, by, and, informed, by, the, knowledge, of, the, chemistry, of, the, constituent, parts, and, the, x, ray, diffraction, patterns, obtained, by, rosalind, franklin, this, discovery, lead, to, an, explosion, of, research, into, the, biochemistry, of, life, in, the, same, year, the, miller, urey, experiment, demonstrated, that, basic, constituents, of, protein, simple, amino, acids, could, themselves, be, built, up, from, simpler, molecules, in, a, simulation, of, primordial, processes, on, earth, this, first, attempt, by, chemists, to, study, hypothetical, processes, in, the, laboratory, under, controlled, conditions, helped, kickstart, bountiful, research, within, the, natural, sciences, into, the, origins, of, life, in, 1983, kary, mullis, devised, a, method, for, the, in, vitro, amplification, of, dna, known, as, the, polymerase, chain, reaction, pcr, which, revolutionized, the, chemical, processes, used, in, the, laboratory, to, manipulate, it, pcr, could, be, used, to, synthesize, specific, pieces, of, dna, and, made, possible, the, sequencing, of, dna, of, organisms, which, culminated, in, the, huge, human, genome, project, an, important, piece, in, the, double, helix, puzzle, was, solved, by, one, of, pauling, s, students, matthew, meselson, and, frank, stahl, the, result, of, their, collaboration, meselson, stahl, experiment, has, been, called, as, the, most, beautiful, experiment, in, biology, they, used, a, centrifugation, technique, that, sorted, molecules, according, to, differences, in, weight, because, nitrogen, atoms, are, a, component, of, dna, they, were, labelled, and, therefore, tracked, in, replication, in, bacteria, in, 1970, john, pople, developed, the, gaussian, program, greatly, easing, computational, chemistry, calculations, in, 1971, yves, chauvin, offered, an, explanation, of, the, reaction, mechanism, of, olefin, metathesis, reactions, in, 1975, karl, barry, sharpless, and, his, group, discovered, stereoselective, oxidation, reactions, including, sharpless, epoxidation, sharpless, asymmetric, dihydroxylation, and, sharpless, oxyamination, in, 1985, harold, kroto, robert, curl, and, richard, smalley, discovered, fullerenes, a, class, of, large, carbon, molecules, superficially, resembling, the, geodesic, dome, designed, by, architect, r, buckminster, fuller, in, 1991, sumio, iijima, used, electron, microscopy, to, discover, a, type, of, cylindrical, fullerene, known, as, a, carbon, nanotube, though, earlier, work, had, been, done, in, the, field, as, early, as, 1951, this, material, is, an, important, component, in, the, field, of, nanotechnology, in, 1994, k, c, nicolaou, with, his, group, and, robert, a, holton, and, his, group, achieved, the, first, total, synthesis, of, taxol, in, 1995, eric, cornell, and, carl, wieman, produced, the, first, bose, einstein, condensate, a, substance, that, displays, quantum, mechanical, properties, on, the, macroscopic, scale, before, the, 20th, century, chemistry, was, defined, as, the, science, of, the, nature, of, matter, and, its, transformations, it, was, therefore, distinct, from, physics, which, was, not, concerned, with, such, dramatic, transformation, of, matter, moreover, in, contrast, to, physics, chemistry, remained, predominantly, a, descriptive, and, empirical, science, until, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, though, they, developed, a, consistent, quantitative, foundation, based, on, notions, of, atomic, and, molecular, weights, combining, proportions, and, thermodynamic, quantities, chemists, had, less, use, of, advanced, mathematics, some, even, expressed, reluctance, about, the, use, of, mathematics, within, chemistry, for, example, the, philosopher, auguste, comte, wrote, in, 1830, every, attempt, to, employ, mathematical, methods, in, the, study, of, chemical, questions, must, be, considered, profoundly, irrational, and, contrary, to, the, spirit, of, chemistry, if, mathematical, analysis, should, ever, hold, a, prominent, place, in, chemistry, an, aberration, which, is, happily, almost, impossible, it, would, occasion, a, rapid, and, widespread, degeneration, of, that, science, however, in, the, second, part, of, the, 19th, century, the, situation, began, to, change, as, august, kekul, wrote, in, 1867, i, rather, expect, that, we, shall, someday, find, a, mathematico, mechanical, explanation, for, what, we, now, call, atoms, which, will, render, an, account, of, their, properties, as, understanding, of, the, nature, of, matter, has, evolved, so, too, has, the, self, understanding, of, the, science, of, chemistry, by, its, practitioners, this, continuing, historical, process, of, evaluation, includes, the, categories, terms, aims, and, scope, of, chemistry, additionally, the, development, of, the, social, institutions, and, networks, which, support, chemical, enquiry, are, highly, significant, factors, that, enable, the, production, dissemination, and, application, of, chemical, knowledge, see, philosophy, of, chemistry, the, later, part, of, the, nineteenth, century, saw, a, huge, increase, in, the, exploitation, of, petroleum, extracted, from, the, earth, for, the, production, of, a, host, of, chemicals, and, largely, replaced, the, use, of, whale, oil, coal, tar, and, naval, stores, used, previously, large, scale, production, and, refinement, of, petroleum, provided, feedstocks, for, liquid, fuels, such, as, gasoline, and, diesel, solvents, lubricants, asphalt, waxes, and, for, the, production, of, many, of, the, common, materials, of, the, modern, world, such, as, synthetic, fibers, plastics, paints, detergents, pharmaceuticals, adhesives, and, ammonia, as, fertilizer, and, for, other, uses, many, of, these, required, new, catalysts, and, the, utilization, of, chemical, engineering, for, their, cost, effective, production, in, the, mid, twentieth, century, control, of, the, electronic, structure, of, semiconductor, materials, was, made, precise, by, the, creation, of, large, ingots, of, extremely, pure, single, crystals, of, silicon, and, germanium, accurate, control, of, their, chemical, composition, by, doping, with, other, elements, made, the, production, of, the, solid, state, transistor, in, 1951, and, made, possible, the, production, of, tiny, integrated, circuits, for, use, in, electronic, devices, especially, computers, listed, chronologically, something, has, been, said, about, the, chemical, excellence, of, cast, iron, in, ancient, india, and, about, the, high, industrial, development, of, the, gupta, times, when, india, was, looked, to, even, by, imperial, rome, as, the, most, skilled, of, the, nations, in, such, chemical, industries, as, dyeing, tanning, soap, making, glass, and, cement, by, the, sixth, century, the, hindus, were, far, ahead, of, europe, in, industrial, chemistry, they, were, masters, of, calcinations, distillation, sublimation, steaming, fixation, the, production, of, light, without, heat, the, mixing, of, anesthetic, and, soporific, powders, and, the, preparation, of, metallic, salts, compounds, and, alloys, the, tempering, of, steel, was, brought, in, ancient, india, to, a, perfection, unknown, in, europe, till, our, own, times, king, porus, is, said, to, have, selected, as, a, specially, valuable, gift, from, alexander, not, gold, or, silver, but, thirty, pounds, of, steel, the, moslems, took, much, of, this, hindu, chemical, science, and, industry, to, the, near, east, and, europe, the, secret, of, manufacturing, damascus, blades, for, example, was, taken, by, the, arabs, from, the, persians, and, by, the, persians, from, india, two, systems, of, hindu, thought, propound, physical, theories, suggestively, similar, to, those, of, greece, kanada, founder, of, the, vaisheshika, philosophy, held, that, the, world, was, composed, of, atoms, as, many, in, kind, as, the, various, elements, the, jains, more, nearly, approximated, to, democritus, by, teaching, that, all, atoms, were, of, the, same, kind, producing, different, effects, by, diverse, modes, of, combinations, kanada, believed, light, and, heat, to, be, varieties, of, the, same, substance, udayana, taught, that, all, heat, comes, from, the, sun, and, vachaspati, like, newton, interpreted, light, as, composed, of, minute, particles, emitted, by, substances, and, striking, the, eye
