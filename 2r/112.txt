the, peopling, of, the, americas, began, when, paleolithic, hunter, gatherers, paleo, indians, entered, north, america, from, the, north, asian, mammoth, steppe, via, the, beringia, land, bridge, which, had, formed, between, northeastern, siberia, and, western, alaska, due, to, the, lowering, of, sea, level, during, the, last, glacial, maximum, 26, 000, to, 19, 000, years, ago, these, populations, expanded, south, of, the, laurentide, ice, sheet, and, spread, rapidly, southward, occupying, both, north, and, south, america, by, 12, 000, to, 14, 000, years, ago, the, earliest, populations, in, the, americas, before, roughly, 10, 000, years, ago, are, known, as, paleo, indians, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, have, been, linked, to, siberian, populations, by, proposed, linguistic, factors, the, distribution, of, blood, types, and, in, genetic, composition, as, reflected, by, molecular, data, such, as, dna, while, there, is, general, agreement, that, the, americas, were, first, settled, from, asia, the, pattern, of, migration, and, the, place, s, of, origin, in, eurasia, of, the, peoples, who, migrated, to, the, americas, remain, unclear, the, traditional, theory, is, that, ancient, beringians, moved, when, sea, levels, were, significantly, lowered, due, to, the, quaternary, glaciation, following, herds, of, now, extinct, pleistocene, megafauna, along, ice, free, corridors, that, stretched, between, the, laurentide, and, cordilleran, ice, sheets, another, route, proposed, is, that, either, on, foot, or, using, boats, they, migrated, down, the, pacific, coast, to, south, america, as, far, as, chile, any, archaeological, evidence, of, coastal, occupation, during, the, last, ice, age, would, now, have, been, covered, by, the, sea, level, rise, up, to, a, hundred, metres, since, then, the, precise, date, for, the, peopling, of, the, americas, is, a, long, standing, open, question, and, while, advances, in, archaeology, pleistocene, geology, physical, anthropology, and, dna, analysis, have, progressively, shed, more, light, on, the, subject, significant, questions, remain, unresolved, the, clovis, first, theory, refers, to, the, hypothesis, that, the, clovis, culture, represents, the, earliest, human, presence, in, the, americas, about, 13, 000, years, ago, evidence, of, pre, clovis, cultures, has, accumulated, and, pushed, back, the, possible, date, of, the, first, peopling, of, the, americas, academics, generally, believe, that, humans, reached, north, america, south, of, the, laurentide, ice, sheet, at, some, point, between, 15, 000, and, 20, 000, years, ago, some, new, controversial, archaeological, evidence, suggests, the, possibility, that, human, arrival, in, the, americas, may, have, occurred, prior, to, the, last, glacial, maximum, more, than, 20, 000, years, ago, during, the, wisconsin, glaciation, the, earth, s, ocean, water, was, to, varying, degrees, over, time, stored, in, glacier, ice, as, water, accumulated, in, glaciers, the, volume, of, water, in, the, oceans, correspondingly, decreased, resulting, in, lowering, of, global, sea, level, the, variation, of, sea, level, over, time, has, been, reconstructed, using, oxygen, isotope, analysis, of, deep, sea, cores, the, dating, of, marine, terraces, and, high, resolution, oxygen, isotope, sampling, from, ocean, basins, and, modern, ice, caps, a, drop, of, eustatic, sea, level, by, about, 60, to, 120, metres, 200, to, 390, ft, from, present, day, levels, commencing, around, 30, 000, years, before, present, bp, created, beringia, a, durable, and, extensive, geographic, feature, connecting, siberia, with, alaska, with, the, rise, of, sea, level, after, the, last, glacial, maximum, lgm, the, beringian, land, bridge, was, again, submerged, estimates, of, the, final, re, submergence, of, the, beringian, land, bridge, based, purely, on, present, bathymetry, of, the, bering, strait, and, eustatic, sea, level, curve, place, the, event, around, 11, 000, years, bp, figure, 1, ongoing, research, reconstructing, beringian, paleogeography, during, deglaciation, could, change, that, estimate, and, possible, earlier, submergence, could, further, constrain, models, of, human, migration, into, north, america, the, onset, of, the, last, glacial, maximum, after, 30, 000, years, bp, saw, the, expansion, of, alpine, glaciers, and, continental, ice, sheets, that, blocked, migration, routes, out, of, beringia, by, 21, 000, years, bp, and, possibly, thousands, of, years, earlier, the, cordilleran, and, laurentide, ice, sheets, coalesced, east, of, the, rocky, mountains, closing, off, a, potential, migration, route, into, the, center, of, north, america, alpine, glaciers, in, the, coastal, ranges, and, the, alaskan, peninsula, isolated, the, interior, of, beringia, from, the, pacific, coast, coastal, alpine, glaciers, and, lobes, of, cordilleran, ice, coalesced, into, piedmont, glaciers, that, covered, large, stretches, of, the, coastline, as, far, south, as, vancouver, island, and, formed, an, ice, lobe, across, the, straits, of, juan, de, fuca, by, 18, 000, bp, coastal, alpine, glaciers, started, to, retreat, around, 19, 000, bp, while, cordilleran, ice, continued, advancing, in, the, puget, lowlands, up, to, 16, 800, bp, even, during, the, maximum, extent, of, coastal, ice, unglaciated, refugia, persisted, on, present, day, islands, that, supported, terrestrial, and, marine, mammals, as, deglaciation, occurred, refugia, expanded, until, the, coast, became, ice, free, by, 15, 000, bp, the, retreat, of, glaciers, on, the, alaskan, peninsula, provided, access, from, beringia, to, the, pacific, coast, by, around, 17, 000, bp, the, ice, barrier, between, interior, alaska, and, the, pacific, coast, broke, up, starting, around, 16, 200, bp, the, ice, free, corridor, to, the, interior, of, north, america, opened, between, 13, 000, and, 12, 000, bp, glaciation, in, eastern, siberia, during, the, lgm, was, limited, to, alpine, and, valley, glaciers, in, mountain, ranges, and, did, not, block, access, between, siberia, and, beringia, the, paleoclimates, and, vegetation, of, eastern, siberia, and, alaska, during, the, wisconsin, glaciation, have, been, deduced, from, high, resolution, oxygen, isotope, data, and, pollen, stratigraphy, prior, to, the, last, glacial, maximum, climates, in, eastern, siberia, fluctuated, between, conditions, approximating, present, day, conditions, and, colder, periods, the, pre, lgm, warm, cycles, in, arctic, siberia, saw, flourishes, of, megafaunas, the, oxygen, isotope, record, from, the, greenland, ice, cap, suggests, that, these, cycles, after, about, 45, 000, bp, lasted, anywhere, from, hundreds, to, between, one, and, two, thousand, years, with, greater, duration, of, cold, periods, starting, around, 32, 000, bp, the, pollen, record, from, elikchan, lake, north, of, the, sea, of, okhotsk, shows, a, marked, shift, from, tree, and, shrub, pollen, to, herb, pollen, prior, to, 30, 000, bp, as, herb, tundra, replaced, boreal, forest, and, shrub, steppe, going, into, the, lgm, a, similar, record, of, tree, shrub, pollen, being, replaced, with, herb, pollen, as, the, lgm, approached, was, recovered, near, the, kolyma, river, in, arctic, siberia, the, abandonment, of, the, northern, regions, of, siberia, due, to, rapid, cooling, or, the, retreat, of, game, species, with, the, onset, of, the, lgm, has, been, proposed, to, explain, the, lack, of, archaeological, sites, in, that, region, dating, to, the, lgm, the, pollen, record, from, the, alaskan, side, shows, shifts, between, herb, shrub, and, shrub, tundra, prior, to, the, lgm, suggesting, less, dramatic, warming, episodes, than, those, that, allowed, forest, colonization, on, the, siberian, side, diverse, though, not, necessarily, plentiful, megafauna, were, present, in, those, environments, herb, tundra, dominated, during, the, lgm, due, to, cold, and, dry, conditions, coastal, environments, during, the, last, glacial, maximum, were, complex, the, lowered, sea, level, and, an, isostatic, bulge, equilibrated, with, the, depression, beneath, the, cordilleran, ice, sheet, exposed, the, continental, shelf, to, form, a, coastal, plain, while, much, of, the, coastal, plain, was, covered, with, piedmont, glaciers, unglaciated, refugia, supporting, terrestrial, mammals, have, been, identified, on, haida, gwaii, prince, of, wales, island, and, outer, islands, of, the, alexander, archipelago, the, now, submerged, coastal, plain, has, potential, for, more, refugia, pollen, data, indicate, mostly, herb, shrub, tundra, vegetation, in, unglaciated, areas, with, some, boreal, forest, towards, the, southern, end, of, the, range, of, cordilleran, ice, the, coastal, marine, environment, remained, productive, as, indicated, by, fossils, of, pinnipeds, the, highly, productive, kelp, forests, over, rocky, marine, shallows, may, have, been, a, lure, for, coastal, migration, reconstruction, of, the, southern, beringian, coastline, also, suggests, potential, for, a, highly, productive, coastal, marine, environment, pollen, data, indicate, a, warm, period, culminating, between, 17, 000, and, 13, 000, bp, followed, by, cooling, between, 13, 000, and, 11, 500, bp, coastal, areas, deglaciated, rapidly, as, coastal, alpine, glaciers, then, lobes, of, cordilleran, ice, retreated, the, retreat, was, accelerated, as, sea, levels, rose, and, floated, glacial, termini, it, has, been, estimated, that, the, coast, range, was, fully, ice, free, between, 16, 000, and, 15, 000, bp, littoral, marine, organisms, colonized, shorelines, as, ocean, water, replaced, glacial, meltwater, replacement, of, herb, shrub, tundra, by, coniferous, forests, was, underway, by, 15, 000, bp, north, of, haida, gwaii, eustatic, sea, level, rise, caused, flooding, which, accelerated, as, the, rate, grew, more, rapid, the, inland, cordilleran, and, laurentide, ice, sheets, retreated, more, slowly, than, did, the, coastal, glaciers, opening, of, an, ice, free, corridor, did, not, occur, until, after, 13, 000, to, 12, 000, bp, the, early, environment, of, the, ice, free, corridor, was, dominated, by, glacial, outwash, and, meltwater, with, ice, dammed, lakes, and, periodic, flooding, from, the, release, of, ice, dammed, meltwater, biological, productivity, of, the, deglaciated, landscape, increased, slowly, the, earliest, possible, viability, of, the, ice, free, corridor, as, a, human, migration, route, has, been, estimated, at, 11, 500, bp, birch, forests, were, advancing, across, former, herb, tundra, in, beringia, by, 17, 000, bp, in, response, to, climatic, amelioration, indicating, increased, productivity, of, the, landscape, analyses, of, biomarkers, and, microfossils, preserved, in, sediments, from, lake, e5, and, burial, lake, in, northern, alaska, suggest, early, humans, burned, beringian, landscapes, as, early, as, 34, 000, years, ago, the, authors, of, these, studies, suggest, that, fire, was, used, as, means, of, hunting, megafauna, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, have, an, ascertained, archaeological, presence, in, the, americas, dating, back, to, about, 15, 000, years, ago, more, recent, research, however, suggests, a, human, presence, dating, to, between, 18, 000, and, 26, 000, years, ago, during, the, last, glacial, maximum, there, remain, uncertainties, regarding, the, precise, dating, of, individual, sites, and, regarding, conclusions, drawn, from, population, genetics, studies, of, contemporary, native, americans, in, the, early, 21st, century, the, models, of, the, chronology, of, migration, are, divided, into, two, general, approaches, the, first, is, the, short, chronology, theory, that, the, first, migration, occurred, after, the, lgm, which, went, into, decline, after, about, 19, 000, years, ago, and, was, then, followed, by, successive, waves, of, immigrants, the, second, theory, is, the, long, chronology, theory, which, proposes, that, the, first, group, of, people, entered, beringia, including, ice, free, parts, of, alaska, at, a, much, earlier, date, possibly, 40, 000, years, ago, followed, by, a, much, later, second, wave, of, immigrants, the, clovis, first, theory, which, dominated, thinking, on, new, world, anthropology, for, much, of, the, 20th, century, was, challenged, in, the, 2000s, by, the, secure, dating, of, archaeological, sites, in, the, americas, to, before, 13, 000, years, ago, the, archaeological, sites, in, the, americas, with, the, oldest, dates, that, have, gained, broad, acceptance, are, all, compatible, with, an, age, of, about, 15, 000, years, this, includes, the, buttermilk, creek, complex, in, texas, the, meadowcroft, rockshelter, site, in, pennsylvania, and, the, monte, verde, site, in, southern, chile, archaeological, evidence, of, pre, clovis, people, points, to, the, south, carolina, topper, site, being, 16, 000, years, old, at, a, time, when, the, glacial, maximum, would, have, theoretically, allowed, for, lower, coastlines, it, has, often, been, suggested, that, an, ice, free, corridor, in, what, is, now, western, canada, would, have, allowed, migration, before, the, beginning, of, the, holocene, however, a, 2016, study, has, argued, against, this, suggesting, that, the, peopling, of, north, america, via, such, a, corridor, is, unlikely, to, significantly, pre, date, the, earliest, clovis, sites, the, study, concludes, that, the, ice, free, corridor, in, what, is, now, alberta, and, british, columbia, was, gradually, taken, over, by, a, boreal, forest, dominated, by, spruce, and, pine, trees, and, that, the, clovis, people, likely, came, from, the, south, not, the, north, perhaps, following, wild, animals, such, as, bison, an, alternative, hypothesis, for, the, peopling, of, america, is, coastal, migration, which, may, have, been, feasible, along, the, deglaciated, but, now, submerged, coastline, of, the, pacific, northwest, from, about, 16, 000, years, ago, pre, lgm, migration, across, beringia, has, been, proposed, to, explain, purported, pre, lgm, ages, of, archaeological, sites, in, the, americas, such, as, bluefish, caves, and, old, crow, flats, in, the, yukon, territory, and, meadowcroft, rock, shelter, in, pennsylvania, the, oldest, archaeological, sites, on, the, alaskan, side, of, beringia, date, to, around, 14, 000, bp, it, is, possible, that, a, small, founder, population, had, entered, beringia, before, that, time, however, archaeological, sites, that, date, closer, to, the, lgm, on, either, the, siberian, or, the, alaskan, side, of, beringia, are, lacking, biomarker, and, microfossil, analyses, of, sediments, from, lake, e5, and, burial, lake, in, northern, alaska, suggest, human, presence, in, eastern, beringia, as, early, as, 34, 000, years, ago, these, sedimentary, analyses, have, been, suggested, to, be, the, only, possibly, recoverable, remnants, of, humans, living, in, alaska, during, the, last, glacial, period, at, old, crow, flats, mammoth, bones, have, been, found, that, are, broken, in, distinctive, ways, indicating, human, butchery, the, radiocarbon, dates, on, these, vary, between, 25, 000, and, 40, 000, bp, also, stone, microflakes, have, been, found, in, the, area, indicating, tool, production, however, the, interpretations, of, butcher, marks, and, the, geologic, association, of, bones, at, the, bluefish, cave, and, old, crow, flats, sites, and, the, related, bonnet, plume, site, have, been, called, into, question, no, evidence, of, human, remains, have, been, discovered, at, these, sites, in, addition, to, disputed, archaeological, sites, support, for, pre, lgm, human, presence, has, been, found, in, lake, sediment, records, of, northern, alaska, biomarker, and, microfossil, analyses, of, sediments, from, lake, e5, and, burial, lake, in, suggest, human, presence, in, eastern, beringia, as, early, as, 34, 000, years, ago, these, analyses, are, indeed, compelling, in, that, they, corroborate, the, inferences, made, from, the, bluefish, cave, and, old, crow, flats, sites, in, 2020, evidence, emerged, for, a, new, pre, lgm, site, in, north, central, mexico, chiquihuite, cave, an, archaeological, site, in, zacatecas, state, has, been, dated, to, 26, 000, years, bp, based, on, numerous, lithic, artefacts, discovered, there, however, there, is, scholarly, debate, over, whether, the, artifacts, should, be, considered, evidence, of, human, activity, or, if, they, were, formed, naturally, no, evidence, of, human, dna, or, hearth, have, been, unearthed, pre, lgm, human, presence, in, south, america, rests, partly, on, the, chronology, of, the, controversial, pedra, furada, rock, shelter, in, piau, brazil, more, recently, studies, at, the, archaeological, sites, santa, elina, 27000, 10000, years, bp, in, the, midwest, and, rinc, o, i, 20000, 12000, years, bp, in, southeastern, brazil, also, show, associations, of, evidence, of, human, presence, with, sediments, dating, from, before, the, lgm, a, 2003, study, dated, evidence, for, the, controlled, use, of, fire, to, before, 40, 000, years, ago, additional, evidence, has, been, adduced, from, the, morphology, of, luzia, woman, fossil, which, was, described, as, australo, melanesian, this, interpretation, was, challenged, in, a, 2003, review, which, concluded, the, features, in, question, could, also, have, arisen, by, genetic, drift, in, november, 2018, scientists, of, the, university, of, s, o, paulo, and, harvard, university, released, a, study, that, contradicts, the, alleged, australo, melanesian, origin, of, luzia, using, dna, sequencing, the, results, showed, that, luzia, s, ancestry, was, entirely, native, american, stones, described, as, probable, tools, hammerstones, and, anvils, have, been, found, in, southern, california, at, the, cerutti, mastodon, site, that, are, associated, with, a, mastodon, skeleton, which, appeared, to, have, been, processed, by, humans, the, mastodon, skeleton, was, dated, by, thorium, 230, uranium, radiometric, analysis, using, diffusion, adsorption, decay, dating, models, to, around, 130, thousand, years, ago, no, human, bones, were, found, and, expert, reaction, was, mixed, claims, of, tools, and, bone, processing, were, called, not, plausible, by, prof, tom, dillehay, the, yana, river, rhino, horn, site, rhs, has, dated, human, occupation, of, eastern, arctic, siberia, to, 31, 300, bp, that, date, has, been, interpreted, by, some, as, evidence, that, migration, into, beringia, was, imminent, lending, credence, to, occupation, of, beringia, during, the, lgm, however, the, yana, rhs, date, is, from, the, beginning, of, the, cooling, period, that, led, into, the, lgm, a, compilation, of, archaeological, site, dates, throughout, eastern, siberia, suggest, that, the, cooling, period, caused, a, retreat, of, humans, southwards, pre, lgm, lithic, evidence, in, siberia, indicate, a, settled, lifestyle, that, was, based, on, local, resources, while, post, lgm, lithic, evidence, indicate, a, more, migratory, lifestyle, a, 2021, discovery, of, human, footprints, in, relict, lake, sediments, near, white, sands, national, park, in, new, mexico, suggest, a, human, presence, dating, back, to, the, lgm, between, 18, 000, and, 26, 000, years, ago, later, studies, reported, in, october, 2023, confirmed, that, the, age, of, the, human, footprints, to, be, up, to, 23, 000, years, old, the, clovis, first, advocates, have, not, accepted, the, veracity, of, these, findings, in, 2022, they, said, the, oldest, evidence, for, archaeological, sites, in, the, new, world, with, large, numbers, of, artifacts, occurring, in, discrete, and, minimally, disturbed, stratigraphic, contexts, occur, in, eastern, beringia, between, 13, 000, and, 14, 200, bp, south, of, the, ice, sheets, the, oldest, such, sites, occur, in, association, with, the, clovis, complex, if, humans, managed, to, breach, the, continental, ice, sheets, significantly, before, 13, 000, bp, there, should, be, clear, evidence, for, it, in, the, form, of, at, least, some, stratigraphically, discrete, archaeological, components, with, a, relatively, high, artifact, count, so, far, no, such, evidence, exists, genetic, studies, have, used, high, resolution, analytical, techniques, applied, to, dna, samples, from, modern, native, americans, and, asian, populations, regarded, as, their, source, populations, to, reconstruct, the, development, of, human, y, chromosome, dna, haplogroups, ydna, haplogroups, and, human, mitochondrial, dna, haplogroups, mtdna, haplogroups, characteristic, of, native, american, populations, models, of, molecular, evolution, rates, were, used, to, estimate, the, ages, at, which, native, american, dna, lineages, branched, off, from, their, parent, lineages, in, asia, and, to, deduce, the, ages, of, demographic, events, one, model, tammetal, 2007, based, on, native, american, mtdna, haplotypes, figure, 2, proposes, that, migration, into, beringia, occurred, between, 30, 000, and, 25, 000, bp, with, migration, into, the, americas, occurring, around, 10, 000, to, 15, 000, years, after, isolation, of, the, small, founding, population, another, model, kitchen, et, al, 2008, proposes, that, migration, into, beringia, occurred, approximately, 36, 000, bp, followed, by, 20, 000, years, of, isolation, in, beringia, a, third, model, nomatto, et, al, 2009, proposes, that, migration, into, beringia, occurred, between, 40, 000, and, 30, 000, bp, with, a, pre, lgm, migration, into, the, americas, followed, by, isolation, of, the, northern, population, following, closure, of, the, ice, free, corridor, evidence, of, australo, melanesians, admixture, in, amazonian, populations, was, found, by, skoglund, and, reich, 2016, a, study, of, the, diversification, of, mtdna, haplogroups, c, and, d, from, southern, siberia, and, eastern, asia, respectively, suggests, that, the, parent, lineage, subhaplogroup, d4h, of, subhaplogroup, d4h3, a, lineage, found, among, native, americans, and, han, chinese, emerged, around, 20, 000, bp, constraining, the, emergence, of, d4h3, to, post, lgm, age, estimates, based, on, y, chromosome, micro, satellite, diversity, place, origin, of, the, american, haplogroup, q1a3a, y, dna, at, around, 15, 000, to, 10, 000, bp, greater, consistency, of, dna, molecular, evolution, rate, models, with, each, other, and, with, archaeological, data, may, be, gained, by, the, use, of, dated, fossil, dna, to, calibrate, molecular, evolution, rates, although, there, is, no, archaeological, evidence, that, can, be, used, to, direct, support, a, coastal, migration, route, during, the, last, glacial, maximum, genetic, analysis, has, been, used, to, support, this, thesis, in, addition, to, human, genetic, lineage, megafaunal, dna, lineage, can, be, used, to, trace, movements, of, megafauna, large, mammalian, as, well, as, the, early, human, groups, who, hunted, them, bison, a, type, of, megafauna, have, been, identified, as, an, ideal, candidate, for, the, tracing, of, human, migrations, out, of, europe, because, of, both, their, abundance, in, north, america, as, well, as, being, one, of, the, first, megafauna, for, which, ancient, dna, was, used, to, trace, patterns, of, population, movement, unlike, other, types, of, fauna, that, moved, between, the, americas, and, eurasia, mammoths, horses, and, lions, bison, survived, the, north, american, extinction, event, that, occurred, at, the, end, of, the, pleistocene, their, genome, however, contains, evidence, of, a, bottleneck, something, that, can, be, used, to, test, hypothesis, on, migrations, between, the, two, continents, early, human, groups, were, largely, nomadic, relying, on, following, food, sources, for, survival, mobility, was, part, of, what, made, humans, successful, as, nomadic, groups, early, humans, likely, followed, the, food, from, eurasia, to, the, americas, part, of, the, reason, why, tracing, megafaunal, dna, is, so, helpful, for, garnering, insight, to, these, migratory, patterns, the, grey, wolf, originated, in, the, americas, and, migrated, into, eurasia, prior, to, the, last, glacial, maximum, during, which, it, was, believed, that, remaining, populations, of, the, grey, wolf, residing, in, north, america, faced, extinction, and, were, isolated, from, the, rest, of, the, population, this, however, may, not, be, the, case, radiocarbon, dating, of, ancient, grey, wolf, remains, found, in, permafrost, deposits, in, alaska, show, a, continuous, exchange, of, population, from, 12, 500, radiocarbon, years, bp, to, beyond, radiocarbon, dating, capabilities, this, indicates, that, there, was, viable, passage, for, grey, wolf, populations, to, exchange, between, the, two, continents, these, faunas, ability, to, exchange, populations, during, the, period, of, the, last, glacial, maximum, along, with, genetic, evidence, found, from, early, human, remains, in, the, americas, provides, evidence, to, support, pre, clovis, migrations, into, the, americas, the, native, american, source, population, was, formed, in, siberia, by, the, mixing, of, two, distinct, populations, ancient, north, eurasians, and, an, ancient, east, asian, esea, population, according, to, jennifer, raff, the, ancient, north, eurasian, population, mixed, with, a, daughter, population, of, ancient, east, asians, who, they, encountered, around, 25, 000, years, ago, which, led, to, the, emergence, of, native, american, ancestral, populations, however, the, exact, location, where, the, admixture, took, place, is, unknown, and, the, migratory, movements, that, united, the, two, populations, are, a, matter, of, debate, one, theory, supposes, that, ancient, north, eurasians, migrated, south, to, east, asia, or, southern, siberia, where, they, would, have, encountered, and, mixed, with, ancient, east, asians, genetic, evidence, from, lake, baikal, in, russia, supports, this, area, as, the, location, where, the, admixture, took, place, however, a, third, theory, the, beringian, standstill, hypothesis, suggests, that, east, asians, instead, migrated, north, to, northeastern, siberia, where, they, mixed, with, ane, and, later, diverged, in, beringia, where, distinct, native, american, lineages, formed, this, theory, is, supported, by, maternal, and, nuclear, dna, evidence, according, to, grebenyuk, after, 20, 000, bp, a, branch, of, ancient, east, asians, migrated, to, northeastern, siberia, and, mixed, with, descendants, of, the, ane, leading, to, the, emergence, of, ancient, paleo, siberian, and, native, american, populations, in, extreme, northeastern, asia, however, the, beringian, standstill, hypothesis, is, not, supported, by, paternal, dna, evidence, which, may, reflect, different, population, histories, for, paternal, and, maternal, lineages, in, native, americans, which, is, not, uncommon, and, has, been, observed, in, other, populations, a, 2019, study, suggested, that, native, americans, are, the, closest, living, relatives, to, 10, 000, year, old, fossils, found, near, the, kolyma, river, in, northeastern, siberia, a, study, published, in, july, 2022, suggested, that, people, in, southern, china, may, have, contributed, to, the, native, american, gene, pool, based, on, the, discovery, and, dna, analysis, of, 14, 000, year, old, human, fossils, the, contrast, between, the, genetic, profiles, of, the, hokkaido, j, mon, skeletons, and, the, modern, ainu, illustrates, another, uncertainty, in, source, models, derived, from, modern, dna, samples, the, development, of, high, resolution, genomic, analysis, has, provided, opportunities, to, further, define, native, american, subclades, and, narrow, the, range, of, asian, subclades, that, may, be, parent, or, sister, subclades, the, common, occurrence, of, the, mtdna, haplogroups, a, b, c, and, d, among, eastern, asian, and, native, american, populations, has, long, been, recognized, along, with, the, presence, of, haplogroup, x, as, a, whole, the, greatest, frequency, of, the, four, native, american, associated, haplogroups, occurs, in, the, altai, baikal, region, of, southern, siberia, some, subclades, of, c, and, d, closer, to, the, native, american, subclades, occur, among, mongolian, amur, japanese, korean, and, ainu, populations, with, further, definition, of, subclades, related, to, native, american, populations, the, requirements, for, sampling, asian, populations, to, find, the,

source, population, from, that, region, distinct, from, the, altai, baikal, source, populations, where, sampling, did, not, reveal, those, two, particular, subclades, the, conclusions, regarding, subhaplogroup, d1, indicating, potential, source, populations, in, the, lower, amur, and, hokkaido, areas, stand, in, contrast, to, the, single, source, migration, model, subhaplogroup, d4h3, has, been, identified, among, han, chinese, subhaplogroup, d4h3, from, china, does, not, have, the, same, geographic, implication, as, subhaplotype, d1a, from, amur, hokkaido, so, its, implications, for, source, models, are, more, speculative, its, parent, lineage, subhaplotype, d4h, is, believed, to, have, emerged, in, east, asia, rather, than, siberia, around, 20, 000, bp, subhaplogroup, d4h2, a,

indigenous, americans, native, americans, mostly, belong, to, the, x2a, clade, which, has, never, been, found, in, the, old, world, according, to, jennifer, raff, x2a, probably, originated, in, the, same, siberian, population, as, the, other, four, founding, maternal, lineages, and, that, there, is, no, compelling, reason, to, believe, it, is, related, to, x, lineages, found, in, europe, or, west, eurasia, the, kennewick, man, fossil, was, found, to, carry, the, deepest, branch, of, the, x2a, haplogroup, and, he, did, not, have, any, european, ancestry, that, would, be, expected, for, a,

finding, ignited, controversy, with, contention, that, the, sample, dna, was, insufficiently, complete, for, the, conclusion, and, that, the, result, reflected, modern, contamination, however, a, re, analysis, indicated, that, the, dna, sequences, were, consistent, with, but, not, definitely, from, the, cosmopolitan, clade, subtype, a, the, presence, of, subtypes, a, and, b, in, the, americas, is, suggestive, of, a, native, american, source, population, related, to, the, ainu, ancestors, the, j, mon, paleo, indian, skeletons, in, the, americas, such, as, kennewick, man, washington, state, hoya,

33, skulls, from, baja, california, have, exhibited, certain, craniofacial, traits, distinct, from, most, modern, native, americans, leading, physical, anthropologists, to, posit, an, earlier, paleoamerican, population, wave, the, most, basic, measured, distinguishing, trait, is, the, dolichocephaly, of, the, skull, some, modern, isolated, populations, such, as, the, peric, es, of, baja, california, and, the, fuegians, of, tierra, del, fuego, exhibit, that, same, morphological, trait, other, anthropologists, advocate, an, alternative, hypothesis, that, evolution, of, an, original, beringian, phenotype, gave, rise, to, a, distinct, morphology, that, was, similar, in, all, known, paleoamerican, skulls, followed, by, later, convergence, towards, the, modern, native, american, phenotype, archaeogenetic, studies, do, not, support, a, two, wave, model, or, the, paleoamerican, hypothesis, of, an, australo, melanesian, origin, and, firmly, assign, all, paleo, indians, and, modern, native, americans, to, one, ancient, population, that, entered, the, americas, in, a, single, migration, from, beringia, only, in, one, ancient, specimen, lagoa, santa, and, a, few, modern, populations, in, the, amazon, region, a, small, australasian, ancestry, component, of, c, 3, was, detected, which, remains, unexplained, by, the, current, state, of, research, as, of, 2021, but, may, be, explained, by, the, presence, of, the, more, basal, tianyuan, related, ancestry, a, deep, east, asian, lineage, which, did, not, directly, contribute, to, modern, east, asians, but, may, have, contributed, to, the, ancestors, of, native, americans, in, siberia, as, such, ancestry, is, also, found, among, previous, paleolithic, siberians, ancient, north, eurasians, a, report, published, in, the, american, journal, of, physical, anthropology, in, january, 2015, reviewed, craniofacial, variation, focusing, on, differences, between, early, and, late, native, americans, and, explanations, for, these, based, on, either, skull, morphology, or, molecular, genetics, arguments, based, on, molecular, genetics, have, in, the, main, according, to, the, authors, accepted, a, single, migration, from, asia, with, a, probable, pause, in, beringia, plus, later, bi, directional, gene, flow, some, studies, focusing, on, craniofacial, morphology, have, previously, argued, that, paleoamerican, remains, have, been, described, as, closer, to, australo, melanesians, and, polynesians, than, to, the, modern, series, of, native, americans, suggesting, two, entries, into, the, americas, an, early, one, occurring, before, a, distinctive, east, asian, morphology, developed, referred, to, in, the, paper, as, the, two, components, model, another, third, model, the, recurrent, gene, flow, rgf, model, attempts, to, reconcile, the, two, arguing, that, circumarctic, gene, flow, after, the, initial, migration, could, account, for, morphological, changes, it, specifically, re, evaluates, the, original, report, on, the, hoya, negro, skeleton, which, supported, the, rgf, model, the, authors, disagreed, with, the, original, conclusion, which, suggested, that, the, skull, shape, did, not, match, those, of, modern, native, americans, arguing, that, the, skull, falls, into, a, subregion, of, the, morphospace, occupied, by, both, paleoamericans, and, some, modern, native, americans, stemmed, points, are, a, lithic, technology, distinct, from, beringian, and, clovis, types, they, have, a, distribution, ranging, from, coastal, east, asia, to, the, pacific, coast, of, south, america, the, emergence, of, stemmed, points, has, been, traced, to, korea, during, the, upper, paleolithic, the, origin, and, distribution, of, stemmed, points, have, been, interpreted, as, a, cultural, marker, related, to, a, source, population, from, coastal, east, asia, historically, theories, about, migration, into, the, americas, have, revolved, around, migration, from, beringia, through, the, interior, of, north, america, the, discovery, of, artifacts, in, association, with, pleistocene, faunal, remains, near, clovis, new, mexico, in, the, early, 1930s, required, extension, of, the, timeframe, for, the, settlement, of, north, america, to, the, period, during, which, glaciers, were, still, extensive, that, led, to, the, hypothesis, of, a, migration, route, between, the, laurentide, and, cordilleran, ice, sheets, to, explain, the, early, settlement, the, clovis, site, was, host, to, a, lithic, technology, characterized, by, spear, points, with, an, indentation, or, flute, where, the, point, was, attached, to, the, shaft, a, lithic, complex, characterized, by, the, clovis, point, technology, was, subsequently, identified, over, much, of, north, america, and, in, south, america, the, association, of, clovis, complex, technology, with, late, pleistocene, faunal, remains, led, to, the, theory, that, it, marked, the, arrival, of, big, game, hunters, that, migrated, out, of, beringia, and, then, dispersed, throughout, the, americas, otherwise, known, as, the, clovis, first, theory, recent, radiocarbon, dating, of, clovis, sites, has, yielded, ages, of, between, 13, 000, and, 12, 600, bp, somewhat, later, than, dates, derived, from, older, techniques, the, re, evaluation, of, earlier, radiocarbon, dates, led, to, the, conclusion, that, no, fewer, than, 11, of, the, 22, clovis, sites, with, radiocarbon, dates, are, problematic, and, should, be, disregarded, including, the, type, site, in, clovis, new, mexico, numerical, dating, of, clovis, sites, has, allowed, comparison, of, clovis, dates, with, dates, of, other, archaeological, sites, throughout, the, americas, and, of, the, opening, of, the, ice, free, corridor, both, lead, to, significant, challenges, to, the, clovis, first, theory, the, monte, verde, site, of, southern, chile, has, been, dated, at, 14, 800, bp, the, paisley, cave, site, in, eastern, oregon, yielded, a, 14, 500, bp, on, a, coprolite, with, human, dna, and, radiocarbon, dates, of, 13, 200, and, 12, 900, bp, on, horizons, containing, western, stemmed, points, artifact, horizons, with, non, clovis, lithic, assemblages, and, pre, clovis, ages, occur, in, eastern, north, america, although, the, maximum, ages, tend, to, be, poorly, constrained, recent, studies, have, suggested, that, the, ice, free, corridor, opened, later, around, 13, 800, 500, years, ago, than, the, earliest, widely, accepted, archaeological, sites, in, the, americas, suggesting, that, it, could, have, not, have, been, used, as, the, migration, route, for, the, earliest, peoples, to, migrate, south, an, alternative, to, the, beringia, route, is, proposed, by, the, stepping, stones, hypothesis, the, frequent, submergence, of, islands, along, the, bering, transitory, archipelago, would, have, forced, the, inhabitants, of, these, island, to, continue, traveling, across, the, archipelago, until, they, reached, the, mainland, geological, findings, on, the, timing, of, the, ice, free, corridor, also, challenge, the, notion, that, clovis, and, pre, clovis, human, occupation, of, the, americas, was, a, result, of, migration, through, that, route, following, the, last, glacial, maximum, pre, lgm, closing, of, the, corridor, may, approach, 30, 000, bp, and, estimates, of, ice, retreat, from, the, corridor, are, in, the, range, of, 13, 000, to, 12, 000, years, ago, viability, of, the, corridor, as, a, human, migration, route, has, been, estimated, at, 11, 500, bp, later, than, the, ages, of, the, clovis, and, pre, clovis, sites, dated, clovis, archaeological, sites, suggest, a, south, to, north, spread, of, the, clovis, culture, pre, lgm, migration, into, the, interior, has, been, proposed, to, explain, pre, clovis, ages, for, archaeological, sites, in, the, americas, although, pre, clovis, sites, such, as, meadowcroft, rock, shelter, monte, verde, and, paisley, cave, have, not, yielded, confirmed, pre, lgm, ages, there, are, many, pre, clovis, sites, in, the, american, southwest, particularly, in, the, mojave, desert, lake, mojave, quarries, dating, back, to, the, pleistocene, hold, lithic, remains, of, silver, lake, projectile, points, and, lake, mojave, projectile, points, this, indicates, an, interior, movement, into, the, region, as, early, as, 13, 800, bp, if, not, earlier, a, relationship, between, the, na, den, languages, of, north, america, such, as, navajo, and, apache, and, the, yeniseian, languages, of, siberia, was, first, proposed, as, early, as, 1923, and, developed, further, by, others, a, detailed, study, was, done, by, edward, vajda, and, published, in, 2010, this, theory, received, support, from, many, linguists, with, archaeological, and, genetic, studies, providing, it, with, further, support, the, arctic, small, tool, tradition, of, alaska, and, the, canadian, arctic, may, have, originated, in, east, siberia, about, 5, 000, years, ago, this, is, connected, with, the, ancient, paleo, eskimo, peoples, of, the, arctic, the, arctic, small, tool, tradition, source, may, have, been, the, syalakh, bel, kachi, ymyakhtakh, culture, sequence, of, east, siberia, dated, to, 6, 500, 2, 800, bp, the, interior, route, is, consistent, with, the, spread, of, the, na, dene, language, group, and, subhaplogroup, x2a, into, the, americas, after, the, earliest, paleoamerican, migration, nevertheless, some, scholars, suggest, that, the, ancestors, of, western, north, americans, speaking, na, dene, languages, made, a, coastal, migration, by, boat, it, is, possible, that, humans, arrived, in, the, americas, by, way, of, interior, routes, that, existed, prior, to, the, last, glacial, maximum, cosmogenic, exposure, dating, a, technique, that, analyzes, when, in, earth, s, history, a, landscape, was, exposed, to, cosmic, rays, and, therefore, unglaciated, performed, by, mark, swisher, suggests, that, an, older, ice, free, corridor, existed, in, north, america, 25, 000, years, ago, swisher, attributes, sites, such, as, monte, verde, meadowcroft, rockshelter, manis, mastodon, site, and, paisley, caves, to, this, corridor, the, pacific, coastal, migration, theory, proposes, that, people, first, reached, the, americas, via, water, travel, following, coastlines, from, northeast, asia, into, the, americas, originally, proposed, in, 1979, by, knute, fladmark, as, an, alternative, to, the, hypothetical, migration, through, an, ice, free, inland, corridor, this, model, would, help, to, explain, the, rapid, spread, to, coastal, sites, extremely, distant, from, the, bering, strait, region, including, sites, such, as, monte, verde, in, southern, chile, and, taima, taima, in, western, venezuela, the, very, similar, marine, migration, hypothesis, is, a, variant, of, coastal, migration, essentially, its, only, difference, is, that, it, postulates, that, boats, were, the, principal, means, of, travel, the, proposed, use, of, boats, adds, a, measure, of, flexibility, to, the, chronology, of, coastal, migration, because, a, continuous, ice, free, coast, 16, 15, 000, calibrated, years, bp, would, then, not, be, required, migrants, in, boats, could, have, easily, bypassed, ice, barriers, and, settled, in, scattered, coastal, refugia, before, the, deglaciation, of, the, coastal, land, route, was, complete, a, maritime, competent, source, population, in, coastal, east, asia, is, an, essential, part, of, the, marine, migration, hypothesis, a, 2007, article, in, the, journal, of, island, and, coastal, archaeology, proposed, a, kelp, highway, hypothesis, a, variant, of, coastal, migration, based, on, the, exploitation, of, kelp, forests, along, much, of, the, pacific, rim, from, japan, to, beringia, the, pacific, northwest, and, california, and, as, far, as, the, andean, coast, of, south, america, once, the, coastlines, of, alaska, and, british, columbia, had, deglaciated, about, 16, 000, years, ago, these, kelp, forest, along, with, estuarine, mangrove, and, coral, reef, habitats, would, have, provided, an, ecologically, homogenous, migration, corridor, entirely, at, sea, level, and, essentially, unobstructed, a, 2016, dna, analysis, of, plants, and, animals, suggest, a, coastal, route, was, feasible, mitochondrial, subhaplogroup, d4h3a, a, rare, subclade, of, d4h3, occurring, along, the, west, coast, of, the, americas, has, been, identified, as, a, clade, associated, with, coastal, migration, this, haplogroup, was, found, in, a, skeleton, referred, to, as, anzick, 1, found, in, montana, in, close, association, with, several, clovis, artifacts, dated, 12, 500, years, ago, the, coastal, migration, models, provide, a, different, perspective, on, migration, to, the, new, world, but, they, are, not, without, their, own, problems, one, such, problem, is, that, global, sea, levels, have, risen, over, 120, metres, 390, ft, since, the, end, of, the, last, glacial, period, and, this, has, submerged, the, ancient, coastlines, that, maritime, people, would, have, followed, into, the, americas, finding, sites, associated, with, early, coastal, migrations, is, extremely, difficult, and, systematic, excavation, of, any, sites, found, in, deeper, waters, is, challenging, and, expensive, strategies, for, finding, earliest, migration, sites, include, identifying, potential, sites, on, submerged, paleoshorelines, seeking, sites, in, areas, uplifted, either, by, tectonics, or, isostatic, rebound, and, looking, for, riverine, sites, in, areas, that, may, have, attracted, coastal, migrants, on, the, other, hand, there, is, evidence, of, marine, technologies, found, in, the, hills, of, the, channel, islands, of, california, circa, 12, 000, bp, if, there, was, an, early, pre, clovis, coastal, migration, there, is, always, the, possibility, of, a, failed, colonization
