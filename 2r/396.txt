the, age, of, enlightenment, also, the, age, of, reason, and, the, enlightenment, was, the, intellectual, and, philosophical, movement, that, occurred, in, europe, in, the, 17th, and, the, 18th, centuries, the, enlightenment, featured, a, range, of, social, ideas, centered, on, the, value, of, knowledge, learned, by, way, of, rationalism, and, of, empiricism, and, political, ideals, such, as, natural, law, liberty, and, progress, toleration, and, fraternity, constitutional, government, and, the, formal, separation, of, church, and, state, the, enlightenment, was, preceded, by, and, overlaps, the, scientific, revolution, and, the, work, of, johannes, kepler, galileo, galilei, francis, bacon, pierre, gassendi, and, isaac, newton, among, others, as, well, as, the, rationalist, philosophy, of, descartes, hobbes, spinoza, leibniz, and, john, locke, some, date, the, beginning, of, the, enlightenment, to, the, publication, of, ren, descartes, discourse, on, the, method, in, 1637, with, his, method, of, systematically, disbelieving, everything, unless, there, was, a, well, founded, reason, for, accepting, it, and, featuring, his, famous, dictum, cogito, ergo, sum, i, think, therefore, i, am, others, cite, the, publication, of, isaac, newton, s, principia, mathematica, 1687, as, the, culmination, of, the, scientific, revolution, and, the, beginning, of, the, enlightenment, european, historians, traditionally, dated, its, beginning, with, the, death, of, louis, xiv, of, france, in, 1715, and, its, end, with, the, outbreak, of, the, french, revolution, in, 1789, many, historians, now, date, the, end, of, the, enlightenment, as, the, start, of, the, 19th, century, with, the, latest, proposed, year, being, the, death, of, immanuel, kant, in, 1804, in, reality, historical, periods, do, not, have, clearly, defined, start, or, end, dates, philosophers, and, scientists, of, the, period, widely, circulated, their, ideas, through, meetings, at, scientific, academies, masonic, lodges, literary, salons, coffeehouses, and, in, printed, books, journals, and, pamphlets, the, ideas, of, the, enlightenment, undermined, the, authority, of, the, monarchy, and, religious, officials, and, paved, the, way, for, the, political, revolutions, of, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, a, variety, of, 19th, century, movements, including, liberalism, socialism, and, neoclassicism, trace, their, intellectual, heritage, to, the, enlightenment, the, central, doctrines, of, the, enlightenment, were, individual, liberty, and, religious, tolerance, in, opposition, to, an, absolute, monarchy, and, the, power, of, religious, authorities, the, enlightenment, was, marked, by, an, increasing, awareness, of, the, relationship, between, the, mind, and, the, everyday, media, of, the, world, and, by, an, emphasis, on, the, scientific, method, and, reductionism, along, with, increased, questioning, of, religious, orthodoxy, an, attitude, captured, by, kant, s, essay, answering, the, question, what, is, enlightenment, where, the, phrase, sapere, aude, dare, to, know, can, be, found, the, age, of, enlightenment, was, preceded, by, and, closely, associated, with, the, scientific, revolution, earlier, philosophers, whose, work, influenced, the, enlightenment, included, francis, bacon, pierre, gassendi, ren, descartes, thomas, hobbes, baruch, spinoza, john, locke, pierre, bayle, and, gottfried, wilhelm, leibniz, some, of, the, major, figures, of, the, enlightenment, included, cesare, beccaria, george, berkeley, denis, diderot, david, hume, immanuel, kant, lord, monboddo, montesquieu, jean, jacques, rousseau, adam, smith, hugo, grotius, and, voltaire, one, influential, enlightenment, publication, was, the, encyclop, die, encyclopedia, published, between, 1751, and, 1772, in, 35, volumes, it, was, compiled, by, diderot, jean, le, rond, d, alembert, and, a, team, of, 150, others, the, encyclop, die, helped, in, spreading, the, ideas, of, the, enlightenment, across, europe, and, beyond, other, publications, of, the, enlightenment, included, berkeley, s, a, treatise, concerning, the, principles, of, human, knowledge, 1710, voltaire, s, letters, on, the, english, 1733, and, philosophical, dictionary, 1764, hume, s, a, treatise, of, human, nature, 1740, montesquieu, s, the, spirit, of, the, laws, 1748, rousseau, s, discourse, on, inequality, 1754, and, the, social, contract, 1762, cesare, beccaria, s, on, crimes, and, punishments, 1764, adam, smith, s, the, theory, of, moral, sentiments, 1759, and, the, wealth, of, nations, 1776, and, kant, s, critique, of, pure, reason, 1781, bacon, s, empiricism, and, descartes, rationalist, philosophy, laid, the, foundation, for, enlightenment, thinking, descartes, attempt, to, construct, the, sciences, on, a, secure, metaphysical, foundation, was, not, as, successful, as, his, method, of, doubt, applied, in, philosophic, areas, leading, to, a, dualistic, doctrine, of, mind, and, matter, his, skepticism, was, refined, by, locke, s, essay, concerning, human, understanding, 1690, and, hume, s, writings, in, the, 1740s, his, dualism, was, challenged, by, spinoza, s, uncompromising, assertion, of, the, unity, of, matter, in, his, tractatus, 1670, and, ethics, 1677, according, to, jonathan, israel, these, laid, down, two, distinct, lines, of, enlightenment, thought, first, the, moderate, variety, following, descartes, locke, and, christian, wolff, which, sought, accommodation, between, reform, and, the, traditional, systems, of, power, and, faith, and, second, the, radical, enlightenment, inspired, by, the, philosophy, of, spinoza, advocating, democracy, individual, liberty, freedom, of, expression, and, eradication, of, religious, authority, the, moderate, variety, tended, to, be, deistic, whereas, the, radical, tendency, separated, the, basis, of, morality, entirely, from, theology, both, lines, of, thought, were, eventually, opposed, by, a, conservative, counter, enlightenment, which, sought, a, return, to, faith, in, the, mid, 18th, century, paris, became, the, center, of, philosophic, and, scientific, activity, challenging, traditional, doctrines, and, dogmas, after, the, edict, of, fontainebleau, in, 1685, the, relationship, between, church, and, the, absolutist, government, was, very, strong, the, early, enlightenment, emerged, in, protest, to, these, circumstances, gaining, ground, under, the, support, of, madame, de, pompadour, the, mistress, of, louis, xv, called, the, si, cle, des, lumi, res, the, philosophical, movement, of, the, enlightenment, had, already, started, by, the, early, 18th, century, when, pierre, bayle, launched, the, popular, and, scholarly, enlightenment, critique, of, religion, as, a, skeptic, bayle, only, partially, accepted, the, philosophy, and, principles, of, rationality, he, did, draw, a, strict, boundary, between, morality, and, religion, the, rigor, of, his, dictionnaire, historique, et, critique, influenced, many, of, the, enlightenment, encyclop, distes, by, the, mid, 18th, century, the, french, enlightenment, had, found, a, focus, in, the, project, of, the, encyclop, die, the, philosophical, movement, was, led, by, voltaire, and, rousseau, who, argued, for, a, society, based, upon, reason, rather, than, faith, and, catholic, doctrine, for, a, new, civil, order, based, on, natural, law, and, for, science, based, on, experiments, and, observation, the, political, philosopher, montesquieu, introduced, the, idea, of, a, separation, of, powers, in, a, government, a, concept, which, was, enthusiastically, adopted, by, the, authors, of, the, united, states, constitution, while, the, philosophes, of, the, french, enlightenment, were, not, revolutionaries, and, many, were, members, of, the, nobility, their, ideas, played, an, important, part, in, undermining, the, legitimacy, of, the, old, regime, and, shaping, the, french, revolution, francis, hutcheson, a, moral, philosopher, and, founding, figure, of, the, scottish, enlightenment, described, the, utilitarian, and, consequentialist, principle, that, virtue, is, that, which, provides, in, his, words, the, greatest, happiness, for, the, greatest, numbers, much, of, what, is, incorporated, in, the, scientific, method, the, nature, of, knowledge, evidence, experience, and, causation, and, some, modern, attitudes, towards, the, relationship, between, science, and, religion, were, developed, by, hutcheson, s, prot, g, s, in, edinburgh, david, hume, and, adam, smith, hume, became, a, major, figure, in, the, skeptical, philosophical, and, empiricist, traditions, of, philosophy, kant, tried, to, reconcile, rationalism, and, religious, belief, individual, freedom, and, political, authority, as, well, as, map, out, a, view, of, the, public, sphere, through, private, and, public, reason, kant, s, work, continued, to, shape, german, thought, and, indeed, all, of, european, philosophy, well, into, the, 20th, century, mary, wollstonecraft, was, one, of, england, s, earliest, feminist, philosophers, she, argued, for, a, society, based, on, reason, and, that, women, as, well, as, men, should, be, treated, as, rational, beings, she, is, best, known, for, her, work, a, vindication, of, the, rights, of, woman, 1791, science, played, an, important, role, in, enlightenment, discourse, and, thought, many, enlightenment, writers, and, thinkers, had, backgrounds, in, the, sciences, and, associated, scientific, advancement, with, the, overthrow, of, religion, and, traditional, authority, in, favour, of, the, development, of, free, speech, and, thought, there, were, immediate, practical, results, the, experiments, of, antoine, lavoisier, were, used, to, create, the, first, modern, chemical, plants, in, paris, and, the, experiments, of, the, montgolfier, brothers, enabled, them, to, launch, the, first, manned, flight, in, a, hot, air, balloon, in, 1783, broadly, speaking, enlightenment, science, greatly, valued, empiricism, and, rational, thought, and, was, embedded, with, the, enlightenment, ideal, of, advancement, and, progress, the, study, of, science, under, the, heading, of, natural, philosophy, was, divided, into, physics, and, a, conglomerate, grouping, of, chemistry, and, natural, history, which, included, anatomy, biology, geology, mineralogy, and, zoology, as, with, most, enlightenment, views, the, benefits, of, science, were, not, seen, universally, rousseau, criticized, the, sciences, for, distancing, man, from, nature, and, not, operating, to, make, people, happier, science, during, the, enlightenment, was, dominated, by, scientific, societies, and, academies, which, had, largely, replaced, universities, as, centres, of, scientific, research, and, development, societies, and, academies, were, also, the, backbone, of, the, maturation, of, the, scientific, profession, scientific, academies, and, societies, grew, out, of, the, scientific, revolution, as, the, creators, of, scientific, knowledge, in, contrast, to, the, scholasticism, of, the, university, some, societies, created, or, retained, links, to, universities, but, contemporary, sources, distinguished, universities, from, scientific, societies, by, claiming, that, the, university, s, utility, was, in, the, transmission, of, knowledge, while, societies, functioned, to, create, knowledge, as, the, role, of, universities, in, institutionalized, science, began, to, diminish, learned, societies, became, the, cornerstone, of, organized, science, official, scientific, societies, were, chartered, by, the, state, to, provide, technical, expertise, most, societies, were, granted, permission, to, oversee, their, own, publications, control, the, election, of, new, members, and, the, administration, of, the, society, in, the, 18th, century, a, tremendous, number, of, official, academies, and, societies, were, founded, in, europe, and, by, 1789, there, were, over, 70, official, scientific, societies, in, reference, to, this, growth, bernard, de, fontenelle, coined, the, term, the, age, of, academies, to, describe, the, 18th, century, another, important, development, was, the, popularization, of, science, among, an, increasingly, literate, population, philosophes, introduced, the, public, to, many, scientific, theories, most, notably, through, the, encyclop, die, and, the, popularization, of, newtonianism, by, voltaire, and, milie, du, ch, telet, some, historians, have, marked, the, 18th, century, as, a, drab, period, in, the, history, of, science, the, century, saw, significant, advancements, in, the, practice, of, medicine, mathematics, and, physics, the, development, of, biological, taxonomy, a, new, understanding, of, magnetism, and, electricity, and, the, maturation, of, chemistry, as, a, discipline, which, established, the, foundations, of, modern, chemistry, the, influence, of, science, began, appearing, more, commonly, in, poetry, and, literature, some, poetry, became, infused, with, scientific, metaphor, and, imagery, while, other, poems, were, written, directly, about, scientific, topics, richard, blackmore, committed, the, newtonian, system, to, verse, in, creation, a, philosophical, poem, in, seven, books, 1712, after, newton, s, death, in, 1727, poems, were, composed, in, his, honour, for, decades, james, thomson, penned, his, poem, to, the, memory, of, newton, which, mourned, the, loss, of, newton, and, praised, his, science, and, legacy, hume, and, other, scottish, enlightenment, thinkers, developed, a, science, of, man, which, was, expressed, historically, in, works, by, authors, including, james, burnett, adam, ferguson, john, millar, and, william, robertson, all, of, whom, merged, a, scientific, study, of, how, humans, behaved, in, ancient, and, primitive, cultures, with, a, strong, awareness, of, the, determining, forces, of, modernity, modern, sociology, largely, originated, from, this, movement, and, hume, s, philosophical, concepts, that, directly, influenced, james, madison, and, thus, the, u, s, constitution, and, as, popularised, by, dugald, stewart, was, the, basis, of, classical, liberalism, in, 1776, adam, smith, published, the, wealth, of, nations, often, considered, the, first, work, on, modern, economics, as, it, had, an, immediate, impact, on, british, economic, policy, that, continues, into, the, 21st, century, it, was, immediately, preceded, and, influenced, by, anne, robert, jacques, turgot, s, drafts, of, reflections, on, the, formation, and, distribution, of, wealth, 1766, smith, acknowledged, indebtedness, and, possibly, was, the, original, english, translator, beccaria, a, jurist, criminologist, philosopher, and, politician, and, one, of, the, great, enlightenment, writers, became, famous, for, his, masterpiece, of, crimes, and, punishments, 1764, later, translated, into, 22, languages, which, condemned, torture, and, the, death, penalty, and, was, a, founding, work, in, the, field, of, penology, and, the, classical, school, of, criminology, by, promoting, criminal, justice, francesco, mario, pagano, wrote, important, studies, such, as, saggi, politici, political, essays, 1783, and, considerazioni, sul, processo, criminale, considerations, on, the, criminal, trial, 1787, which, established, him, as, an, international, authority, on, criminal, law, the, enlightenment, has, long, been, seen, as, the, foundation, of, modern, western, political, and, intellectual, culture, the, enlightenment, brought, political, modernization, to, the, west, in, terms, of, introducing, democratic, values, and, institutions, and, the, creation, of, modern, liberal, democracies, this, thesis, has, been, widely, accepted, by, scholars, and, has, been, reinforced, by, the, large, scale, studies, by, robert, darnton, roy, porter, and, most, recently, by, jonathan, israel, enlightenment, thought, was, deeply, influential, in, the, political, realm, european, rulers, such, as, catherine, ii, of, russia, joseph, ii, of, austria, and, frederick, ii, of, prussia, tried, to, apply, enlightenment, thought, on, religious, and, political, tolerance, which, became, known, as, enlightened, absolutism, many, of, the, major, political, and, intellectual, figures, behind, the, american, revolution, associated, themselves, closely, with, the, enlightenment, benjamin, franklin, visited, europe, repeatedly, and, contributed, actively, to, the, scientific, and, political, debates, there, and, brought, the, newest, ideas, back, to, philadelphia, thomas, jefferson, closely, followed, european, ideas, and, later, incorporated, some, of, the, ideals, of, the, enlightenment, into, the, declaration, of, independence, and, madison, incorporated, these, ideals, into, the, u, s, constitution, during, its, framing, in, 1787, locke, one, of, the, most, influential, enlightenment, thinkers, based, his, governance, philosophy, in, social, contract, theory, a, subject, that, permeated, enlightenment, political, thought, english, philosopher, thomas, hobbes, ushered, in, this, new, debate, with, his, work, leviathan, in, 1651, hobbes, also, developed, some, of, the, fundamentals, of, european, liberal, thought, the, right, of, the, individual, the, natural, equality, of, all, men, the, artificial, character, of, the, political, order, which, led, to, the, later, distinction, between, civil, society, and, the, state, the, view, that, all, legitimate, political, power, must, be, representative, and, based, on, the, consent, of, the, people, and, a, liberal, interpretation, of, law, which, leaves, people, free, to, do, whatever, the, law, does, not, explicitly, forbid, both, locke, and, rousseau, developed, social, contract, theories, in, two, treatises, of, government, and, discourse, on, inequality, respectively, while, quite, different, works, locke, hobbes, and, rousseau, agreed, that, a, social, contract, in, which, the, government, s, authority, lies, in, the, consent, of, the, governed, is, necessary, for, man, to, live, in, civil, society, locke, defines, the, state, of, nature, as, a, condition, in, which, humans, are, rational, and, follow, natural, law, in, which, all, men, are, born, equal, and, with, the, right, to, life, liberty, and, property, however, when, one, citizen, breaks, the, law, of, nature, both, the, transgressor, and, the, victim, enter, into, a, state, of, war, from, which, it, is, virtually, impossible, to, break, free, therefore, locke, said, that, individuals, enter, into, civil, society, to, protect, their, natural, rights, via, an, unbiased, judge, or, common, authority, such, as, courts, in, contrast, rousseau, s, conception, relies, on, the, supposition, that, civil, man, is, corrupted, while, natural, man, has, no, want, he, cannot, fulfill, himself, natural, man, is, only, taken, out, of, the, state, of, nature, when, the, inequality, associated, with, private, property, is, established, rousseau, said, that, people, join, into, civil, society, via, the, social, contract, to, achieve, unity, while, preserving, individual, freedom, this, is, embodied, in, the, sovereignty, of, the, general, will, the, moral, and, collective, legislative, body, constituted, by, citizens, locke, is, known, for, his, statement, that, individuals, have, a, right, to, life, liberty, and, property, and, his, belief, that, the, natural, right, to, property, is, derived, from, labor, tutored, by, locke, anthony, ashley, cooper, 3rd, earl, of, shaftesbury, wrote, in, 1706, there, is, a, mighty, light, which, spreads, its, self, over, the, world, especially, in, those, two, free, nations, of, england, and, holland, on, whom, the, affairs, of, europe, now, turn, locke, s, theory, of, natural, rights, has, influenced, many, political, documents, including, the, u, s, declaration, of, independence, and, the, french, national, constituent, assembly, s, declaration, of, the, rights, of, man, and, of, the, citizen, some, philosophes, argued, that, the, establishment, of, a, contractual, basis, of, rights, would, lead, to, the, market, mechanism, and, capitalism, the, scientific, method, religious, tolerance, and, the, organization, of, states, into, self, governing, republics, through, democratic, means, in, this, view, the, tendency, of, the, philosophes, in, particular, to, apply, rationality, to, every, problem, is, considered, the, essential, change, although, much, of, enlightenment, political, thought, was, dominated, by, social, contract, theorists, hume, and, ferguson, criticized, this, camp, hume, s, essay, of, the, original, contract, argues, that, governments, derived, from, consent, are, rarely, seen, and, civil, government, is, grounded, in, a, ruler, s, habitual, authority, and, force, it, is, precisely, because, of, the, ruler, s, authority, over, and, against, the, subject, that, the, subject, tacitly, consents, and, hume, says, that, the, subjects, would, never, imagine, that, their, consent, made, him, sovereign, rather, the, authority, did, so, similarly, ferguson, did, not, believe, citizens, built, the, state, rather, polities, grew, out, of, social, development, in, his, 1767, an, essay, on, the, history, of, civil, society, ferguson, uses, the, four, stages, of, progress, a, theory, that, was, popular, in, scotland, at, the, time, to, explain, how, humans, advance, from, a, hunting, and, gathering, society, to, a, commercial, and, civil, society, without, agreeing, to, a, social, contract, both, rousseau, s, and, locke, s, social, contract, theories, rest, on, the, presupposition, of, natural, rights, which, are, not, a, result, of, law, or, custom, but, are, things, that, all, men, have, in, pre, political, societies, and, are, therefore, universal, and, inalienable, the, most, famous, natural, right, formulation, comes, from, locke, s, second, treatise, when, he, introduces, the, state, of, nature, for, locke, the, law, of, nature, is, grounded, on, mutual, security, or, the, idea, that, one, cannot, infringe, on, another, s, natural, rights, as, every, man, is, equal, and, has, the, same, inalienable, rights, these, natural, rights, include, perfect, equality, and, freedom, as, well, as, the, right, to, preserve, life, and, property, locke, argues, against, indentured, servitude, on, the, basis, that, enslaving, oneself, goes, against, the, law, of, nature, because, a, person, cannot, surrender, their, own, rights, freedom, is, absolute, and, no, one, can, take, it, away, locke, argues, that, one, person, cannot, enslave, another, because, it, is, morally, reprehensible, although, he, introduces, a, caveat, by, saying, that, enslavement, of, a, lawful, captive, in, time, of, war, would, not, go, against, one, s, natural, rights, the, leaders, of, the, enlightenment, were, not, especially, democratic, as, they, more, often, look, to, absolute, monarchs, as, the, key, to, imposing, reforms, designed, by, the, intellectuals, voltaire, despised, democracy, and, said, the, absolute, monarch, must, be, enlightened, and, must, act, as, dictated, by, reason, and, justice, in, other, words, be, a, philosopher, king, in, several, nations, rulers, welcomed, leaders, of, the, enlightenment, at, court, and, asked, them, to, help, design, laws, and, programs, to, reform, the, system, typically, to, build, stronger, states, these, rulers, are, called, enlightened, despots, by, historians, they, included, frederick, the, great, of, prussia, catherine, the, great, of, russia, leopold, ii, of, tuscany, and, joseph, ii, of, austria, joseph, was, over, enthusiastic, announcing, many, reforms, that, had, little, support, so, that, revolts, broke, out, and, his, regime, became, a, comedy, of, errors, and, nearly, all, his, programs, were, reversed, senior, ministers, pombal, in, portugal, and, johann, friedrich, struensee, in, denmark, also, governed, according, to, enlightenment, ideals, in, poland, the, model, constitution, of, 1791, expressed, enlightenment, ideals, but, was, in, effect, for, only, one, year, before, the, nation, was, partitioned, among, its, neighbors, more, enduring, were, the, cultural, achievements, which, created, a, nationalist, spirit, in, poland, frederick, the, great, the, king, of, prussia, from, 1740, to, 1786, saw, himself, as, a, leader, of, the, enlightenment, and, patronized, philosophers, and, scientists, at, his, court, in, berlin, voltaire, who, had, been, imprisoned, and, maltreated, by, the, french, government, was, eager, to, accept, frederick, s, invitation, to, live, at, his, palace, frederick, explained, my, principal, occupation, is, to, combat, ignorance, and, prejudice, to, enlighten, minds, cultivate, morality, and, to, make, people, as, happy, as, it, suits, human, nature, and, as, the, means, at, my, disposal, permit, the, enlightenment, has, been, frequently, linked, to, the, american, revolution, of, 1776, and, the, french, revolution, of, 1789, both, had, some, intellectual, influence, from, thomas, jefferson, one, view, of, the, political, changes, that, occurred, during, the, enlightenment, is, that, the, consent, of, the, governed, philosophy, as, delineated, by, locke, in, two, treatises, of, government, 1689, represented, a, paradigm, shift, from, the, old, governance, paradigm, under, feudalism, known, as, the, divine, right, of, kings, in, this, view, the, revolutions, were, caused, by, the, fact, that, this, governance, paradigm, shift, often, could, not, be, resolved, peacefully, and, therefore, violent, revolution, was, the, result, a, governance, philosophy, where, the, king, was, never, wrong, would, be, in, direct, conflict, with, one, whereby, citizens, by, natural, law, had, to, consent, to, the, acts, and, rulings, of, their, government, alexis, de, tocqueville, proposed, the, french, revolution, as, the, inevitable, result, of, the, radical, opposition, created, in, the, 18th, century, between, the, monarchy, and, the, men, of, letters, of, the, enlightenment, these, men, of, letters, constituted, a, sort, of, substitute, aristocracy, that, was, both, all, powerful, and, without, real, power, this, illusory, power, came, from, the, rise, of, public, opinion, born, when, absolutist, centralization, removed, the, nobility, and, the, bourgeoisie, from, the, political, sphere, the, literary, politics, that, resulted, promoted, a, discourse, of, equality, and, was, hence, in, fundamental, opposition, to, the, monarchical, regime, de, tocqueville, clearly, designates, the, cultural, effects, of, transformation, in, the, forms, of, the, exercise, of, power, it, does, not, require, great, art, or, magnificently, trained, eloquence, to, prove, that, christians, should, tolerate, each, other, i, however, am, going, further, i, say, that, we, should, regard, all, men, as, our, brothers, what, the, turk, my, brother, the, chinaman, my, brother, the, jew, the, siam, yes, without,

of, religious, conflict, in, europe, especially, the, thirty, years, war, theologians, of, the, enlightenment, wanted, to, reform, their, faith, to, its, generally, non, confrontational, roots, and, to, limit, the, capacity, for, religious, controversy, to, spill, over, into, politics, and, warfare, while, still, maintaining, a, true, faith, in, god, for, moderate, christians, this, meant, a, return, to, simple, scripture, locke, abandoned, the, corpus, of, theological, commentary, in, favor, of, an, unprejudiced, examination, of, the, word, of, god, alone, he, determined, the, essence, of, christianity, to, be, a, belief, in, christ, the, redeemer, and, recommended, avoiding, more, detailed, debate, anthony, collins, one, of, the, english, freethinkers, published, his, essay, concerning, the, use, of, reason, in, propositions, the, evidence, whereof, depends, on, human, testimony, 1707, in, which, he, rejects, the, distinction, between, above, reason, and, contrary, to, reason, and, demands, that, revelation, should, conform, to, man, s, natural, ideas, of, god, in, the, jefferson, bible, thomas, jefferson, went, further, and, dropped, any, passages, dealing, with, miracles, visitations, of, angels, and, the, resurrection, of, jesus, after, his, death, as, he, tried, to, extract, the, practical, christian, moral, code, of, the, new, testament, enlightenment, scholars, sought, to, curtail, the, political, power, of, organized, religion, and, thereby, prevent, another, age, of, intolerant, religious, war, spinoza, determined, to, remove, politics, from, contemporary, and, historical, theology, e, g, disregarding, judaic, law, moses, mendelssohn, advised, affording, no, political, weight, to, any, organized, religion, but, instead, recommended, that, each, person, follow, what, they, found, most, convincing, they, believed, a, good, religion, based, in, instinctive, morals, and, a, belief, in, god, should, not, theoretically, need, force, to, maintain, order, in, its, believers, and, both, mendelssohn, and, spinoza, judged, religion, on, its, moral, fruits, not, the, logic, of, its, theology, several, novel, ideas, about, religion, developed, with, the, enlightenment, including, deism, and, talk, of, atheism, according, to, thomas, paine, deism, is, the, simple, belief, in, god, the, creator, with, no, reference, to, the, bible, or, any, other, miraculous, source, instead, the, deist, relies, solely, on, personal, reason, to, guide, his, creed, which, was, eminently, agreeable, to, many, thinkers, of, the, time, atheism, was, much, discussed, but, there, were, few, proponents, wilson, and, reill, note, in, fact, very, few, enlightened, intellectuals, even, when, they, were, vocal, critics, of, christianity, were, true, atheists, rather, they, were, critics, of, orthodox, belief, wedded, rather, to, skepticism, deism, vitalism, or, perhaps, pantheism, some, followed, pierre, bayle, and, argued, that, atheists, could, indeed, be, moral, men, many, others, like, voltaire, held, that, without, belief, in, a, god, who, punishes, evil, the, moral, order, of, society, was, undermined, that, is, since, atheists, gave, themselves, to, no, supreme, authority, and, no, law, and, had, no, fear, of, eternal, consequences, they, were, far, more, likely, to, disrupt, society, bayle, observed, that, in, his, day, prudent, persons, will, always, maintain, an, appearance, of, and, he, believed, that, even, atheists, could, hold, concepts, of, honor, and, go, beyond, their, own, self, interest, to, create, and, interact, in, society, locke, said, that, if, there, were, no, god, and, no, divine, law, the, result, would, be, moral, anarchy, every, individual, could, have, no, law, but, his, own, will, no, end, but, himself, he, would, be, a, god, to, himself, and, the, satisfaction, of, his, own, will, the, sole, measure, and, end, of, all, his, actions, the, radical, enlightenment, promoted, the, concept, of, separating, church, and, state, an, idea, that, is, often, credited, to, locke, according, to, his, principle, of, the, social, contract, locke, said, that, the, government, lacked, authority, in, the, realm, of, individual, conscience, as, this, was, something, rational, people, could, not, cede, to, the, government, for, it, or, others, to, control, for, locke, this, created, a, natural, right, in, the, liberty, of, conscience, which, he, said, must, therefore, remain, protected, from, any, government, authority, these, views, on, religious, tolerance, and, the, importance, of, individual, conscience, along, with, the, social, contract, became, particularly, influential, in, the, american, colonies, and, the, drafting, of, the, united, states, constitution, in, a, letter, to, the, danbury, baptist, association, in, connecticut, thomas, jefferson, calls, for, a, wall, of, separation, between, church, and, state, at, the, federal, level, he, previously, had, supported, successful, efforts, to, disestablish, the, church, of, england, in, virginia, and, authored, the, virginia, statute, for, religious, freedom, jefferson, s, political, ideals, were, greatly, influenced, by, the, writings, of, locke, bacon, and, newton, whom, he, considered, the, three, greatest, men, that, ever, lived, the, enlightenment, took, hold, in, most, european, countries, and, influenced, nations, globally, often, with, a, specific, local, emphasis, for, example, in, france, it, became, associated, with, anti, government, and, anti, church, radicalism, while, in, germany, it, reached, deep, into, the, middle, classes, where, it, expressed, a, spiritualistic, and, nationalistic, tone, without, threatening, governments, or, established, churches, government, responses, varied, widely, in, france, the, government, was, hostile, and, the, philosophes, fought, against, its, censorship, sometimes, being, imprisoned, or, hounded, into, exile, the, british, government, for, the, most, part, ignored, the, enlightenment, s, leaders, in, england, and, scotland, although, it, did, give, newton, a, knighthood, and, a, very, lucrative, government, office, a, common, theme, among, most, countries, which, derived, enlightenment, ideas, from, europe, was, the, intentional, non, inclusion, of, enlightenment, philosophies, pertaining, to, slavery, originally, during, the, french, revolution, a, revolution, deeply, inspired, by, enlightenment, philosophy, france, s, revolutionary, government, had, denounced, slavery, but, the, property, holding, revolutionaries, then, remembered, their, bank, accounts, slavery, frequently, showed, the, limitations, of, the, enlightenment, ideology, as, it, pertained, to, european, colonialism, since, many, colonies, of, europe, operated, on, a, plantation, economy, fueled, by, slave, labor, in, 1791, the, haitian, revolution, a, slave, rebellion, by, emancipated, slaves, against, french, colonial, rule, in, the, colony, of, saint, domingue, broke, out, european, nations, and, the, united, states, despite, the, strong, support, for, enlightenment, ideals, refused, to, to, saint, domingue, s, anti, colonial, struggle, the, very, existence, of, an, english, enlightenment, has, been, hotly, debated, by, scholars, the, majority, of, textbooks, on, british, history, make, little, or, no, mention, of, an, english, enlightenment, some, surveys, of, the, entire, enlightenment, include, england, and, others, ignore, it, although, they, do, include, coverage, of, such, major, intellectuals, as, joseph, addison, edward, gibbon, john, locke, isaac, newton, alexander, pope, joshua, reynolds, and, jonathan, swift, freethinking, a, term, describing, those, who, stood, in, opposition, to, the, institution, of, the, church, and, the, literal, belief, in, the, bible, can, be, said, to, have, begun, in, england, no, later, than, 1713, when, anthony, collins, wrote, his, discourse, of, free, thinking, which, gained, substantial, popularity, this, essay, attacked, the, clergy, of, all, churches, and, was, a, plea, for, deism, roy, porter, argues, that, the, reasons, for, this, neglect, were, the, assumptions, that, the, movement, was, primarily, french, inspired, that, it, was, largely, a, religious, or, anti, clerical, and, that, it, stood, in, outspoken, defiance, to, the, established, order, porter, admits, that, after, the, 1720s, england, could, claim, thinkers, to, equal, diderot, voltaire, or, rousseau, however, its, leading, intellectuals, such, as, gibbon, edmund, burke, and, samuel, johnson, were, all, quite, conservative, and, supportive, of, the, standing, order, porter, says, the, reason, was, that, enlightenment, had, come, early, to, england, and, had, succeeded, such, that, the, culture, had, accepted, political, liberalism, philosophical, empiricism, and, religious, toleration, positions, which, intellectuals, on, the, continent, had, to, fight, against, powerful, odds, furthermore, england, rejected, the, collectivism, of, the, continent, and, emphasized, the, improvement, of, individuals, as, the, main, goal, of, enlightenment, according, to, derek, hirst, the, 1640s, and, 1650s, saw, a, revived, economy, characterised, by, growth, in, manufacturing, the, elaboration, of, financial, and, credit, instruments, and, the, commercialisation, of, communication, the, gentry, found, time, for, leisure, activities, such, as, horse, racing, and, bowling, in, the, high, culture, important, innovations, included, the, development, of, a, mass, market, for, music, increased, scientific, research, and, an, expansion, of, publishing, all, the, trends, were, discussed, in, depth, at, the, newly, established, coffee, houses, in, the, scottish, enlightenment, the, principles, of, sociability, equality, and, utility, were, disseminated, in, schools, and, universities, many, of, which, used, sophisticated, teaching, methods, which, blended, philosophy, with, daily, life, scotland, s, major, cities, created, an, intellectual, infrastructure, of, mutually, supporting, institutions, such, as, schools, universities, reading, societies, libraries, periodicals, museums, and, masonic, lodges, the, scottish, network, was, predominantly, liberal, calvinist, newtonian, and, design, oriented, in, character, which, played, a, major, role, in, the, further, development, of, the, transatlantic, enlightenment, in, france, voltaire, said, we, look, to, scotland, for, all, our, ideas, of, civilization, the, focus, of, the, scottish, enlightenment, ranged, from, intellectual, and, economic, matters, to, the, specifically, scientific, as, in, the, work, of, william, cullen, physician, and, chemist, james, anderson, agronomist, joseph, black, physicist, and, chemist, and, james, hutton, the, first, modern, geologist, several, americans, especially, benjamin, franklin, and, thomas, jefferson, played, a, major, role, in, bringing, enlightenment, ideas, to, the, new, world, and, in, influencing, british, and, french, thinkers, franklin, was, influential, for, his, political, activism, and, for, his, advances, in, physics, the, cultural, exchange, during, the, age, of, enlightenment, ran, in, both, directions, across, the, atlantic, thinkers, such, as, paine, locke, and, rousseau, all, take, native, american, cultural, practices, as, examples, of, natural, freedom, the, americans, closely, followed, english, and, scottish, political, ideas, as, well, as, some, french, thinkers, such, as, montesquieu, as, deists, they, were, influenced, by, ideas, of, john, toland, and, matthew, tindal, there, was, a, great, emphasis, upon, liberty, republicanism, and, religious, tolerance, there, was, no, respect, for, monarchy, or, inherited, political, power, deists, reconciled, science, and, religion, by, rejecting, prophecies, miracles, and, biblical, theology, leading, deists, included, thomas, paine, in, the, age, of, reason, and, thomas, jefferson, in, his, short, jefferson, bible, from, which, he, removed, all, supernatural, aspects, prussia, took, the, lead, among, the, german, states, in, sponsoring, the, political, reforms, that, enlightenment, thinkers, urged, absolute, rulers, to, adopt, there, were, important, movements, as, well, in, the, smaller, states, of, bavaria, saxony, hanover, and, the, palatinate, in, each, case, enlightenment, values, became, accepted, and, led, to, significant, political, and, administrative, reforms, that, laid, the, groundwork, for, the, creation, of, modern, states, the, princes, of, saxony, for, example, carried, out, an, impressive, series, of, fundamental, fiscal, administrative, judicial, educational, cultural, and, general, economic, reforms, the, reforms, were, aided, by, the, country, s, strong, urban, structure, and, influential, commercial, groups, and, modernized, pre, 1789, saxony, along, the, lines, of, classic, enlightenment, principles, before, 1750, the, german, upper, classes, looked, to, france, for, intellectual, cultural, and, architectural, leadership, as, french, was, the, language, of, high, society, by, the, mid, 18th, century, the, aufkl, rung, the, enlightenment, had, transformed, german, high, culture, in, music, philosophy, science, and, literature, christian, wolff, was, the, pioneer, as, a, writer, who, expounded, the, enlightenment, to, german, readers, and, legitimized, german, as, a, philosophic, language, johann, gottfried, von, herder, broke, new, ground, in, philosophy, and, poetry, as, a, leader, of, the, sturm, und, drang, movement, of, proto, romanticism, weimar, classicism, weimarer, klassik, was, a, cultural, and, literary, movement, based, in, weimar, that, sought, to, establish, a, new, humanism, by, synthesizing, romantic, classical, and, enlightenment, ideas, the, movement, from, 1772, until, 1805, involved, herder, as, well, as, polymath, johann, wolfgang, von, goethe, and, friedrich, schiller, a, poet, and, historian, the, theatre, principal, abel, seyler, greatly, influenced, the, development, of, german, theatre, and, promoted, serious, german, opera, new, works, and, experimental, productions, and, the, concept, of, a, national, theatre, herder, argued, that, every, group, of, people, had, its, own, particular, identity, which, was, expressed, in, its, language, and, culture, this, legitimized, the, promotion, of, german, language, and, culture, and, helped, shape, the, development, of, german, nationalism,

philosophy, well, into, the, 20th, century, german, enlightenment, won, the, support, of, princes, aristocrats, and, the, middle, classes, and, it, permanently, reshaped, the, culture, however, there, was, a, conservatism, among, the, elites, that, warned, against, going, too, far, in, 1788, prussia, issued, an, edict, on, religion, that, forbade, preaching, any, sermon, that, undermined, popular, belief, in, the, holy, trinity, or, the, bible, the, goal, was, to, avoid, theological, disputes, that, might, impinge, on, domestic, tranquility, men, who, doubted, the, value, of, enlightenment, favoured, the, measure, but, so, too, did, many, supporters, german, universities, had, created, a, closed, elite, that, could, debate, controversial, issues, among, themselves, but, spreading, them, to, the, public, was, seen, as, too, risky, this, intellectual, elite, was, favoured, by, the, state, but, that, might, be, reversed, if, the, process, of, the, enlightenment, proved, politically, or, socially, destabilizing, the, reign, of, maria, theresa, the, first, habsburg, monarch, to, be, considered, influenced, by, the, enlightenment, in, some, areas, was, marked, by, a, mix, of,

filangieri, were, active, under, the, tolerant, king, charles, of, bourbon, however, the, neapolitan, enlightenment, like, vico, s, philosophy, remained, almost, always, in, the, theoretical, field, only, later, many, enlighteners, animated, the, unfortunate, experience, of, the, parthenopean, republic, in, milan, however, the, movement, strove, to, find, concrete, solutions, to, problems, the,

organized, to, facilitate, commerce, and, exchange, for, example, by, assigning, to, each, street, a, different, product, or, service, can, be, seen, as, a, direct, application, of, the, enlightenment, ideas, to, governance, and, urbanism, his, urbanistic, ideas, also, being, the, first, large, scale, example, of, earthquake, engineering, became, collectively, known, as, pombaline, style, and, were, implemented, throughout, the, kingdom, during, his, stay, in, office, his, governance, was, as, enlightened, as, ruthless, see, for, example, the, t, vora, affair, in, literature, the, first, enlightenment, ideas, in, portugal, can, be, traced, back, to, the, diplomat, philosopher, and, writer, ant, nio, vieira, who, spent, a, considerable, amount, of, his, life, in, colonial, brazil, denouncing, discriminations, against, new, christians, and, the, indigenous, peoples, in, brazil, during, the, 18th, century, enlightened, literary, movements, such, as, the, arc, dia, lusitana, lasting, from, 1756, until, 1776, then, replaced, by, the, nova, arc, dia, in, 1790, until, 1794, surfaced, in, the, academic, medium, in, particular, involving, former, students, of, the,

library, theatre, public, museum, and, independent, press, like, other, enlightened, despots, catherine, the, great, played, a, key, role, in, fostering, the, arts, sciences, and, education, she, used, her, own, interpretation, of, enlightenment, ideals, assisted, by, notable, international, experts, such, as, voltaire, by, correspondence, and, in, residence, world, class, scientists, such, as, leonhard, euler, and, peter, simon, pallas, the, national, enlightenment, differed, from, its, western, european, counterpart, in, that, it, promoted, further, modernization, of, all, aspects, of, russian, life, and, was, concerned, with, attacking, the, institution, of, serfdom, in, russia, the, russian, enlightenment, centered, on, the, individual, instead, of, societal, enlightenment, and,

forces, that, encouraged, immorality, by, 1794, they, pointed, to, the, reign, of, terror, during, the, french, revolution, as, confirmation, of, their, predictions, romantic, philosophers, argued, that, the, enlightenment, s, excessive, dependence, on, reason, was, a, mistake, that, it, perpetuated, disregarding, the, bonds, of, history, myth, faith, and, tradition, that, were, necessary, to,

latter, part, of, the, 19th, century, with, particular, reference, to, french, philosophy, as, the, equivalent, of, the, french, term, lumi, res, used, first, by, jean, baptiste, dubos, in, 1733, and, already, well, established, by, 1751, from, kant, s, 1784, essay, beantwortung, der, frage, was, ist, aufkl, rung, answering, the, question, what, is, enlightenment, the, german, term, became, aufkl, run, g, aufkl, ren, to, illuminate, sich, aufkl, ren, to, clear, up, however, scholars, have, never, agreed, on, a, definition, of, the, enlightenment, or, on, its, chronological, or, geographical, extent, terms, like, les, lumi, res, french, illuminism, o, italian, ilustraci, n, spanish, and, aufkl, rung, german, referred, to, partly, overlapping, movements, not, until, the, late, 19th, century, did, english, scholars, agree, they, were, talking, about, the, enlightenment, enlightenment, historiography, began, in, the, period, itself, from, what, enlightenment, figures, said, about, their, work, a, dominant, element, was, the, intellectual, angle, they, took, jean, le, rond, d, alembert, s, preliminary, discourse, of, l, encyclop, die, provides, a, history, of, the, enlightenment, which, comprises, a, chronological, list, of, developments, in, the, realm, of, knowledge, of, which, the, encyclop, die, forms, the, pinnacle, in, 1783, mendelssohn, referred, to, enlightenment, as, a, process, by, which, man, was, educated, in, the, use, of, reason, kant, called, enlightenment, man, s, release, from, his, self, incurred, tutelage, tutelage, being, man, s, inability, to, make, use, of, his, understanding, without, direction, from, another, for, kant, enlightenment, was, mankind, s, final, coming, of, age, the, emancipation, of, the, human, consciousness, from, an, immature, state, of, ignorance, the, german, scholar, ernst, cassirer, called, the, enlightenment, a, part, and, a, special, phase, of, that, whole, intellectual, development, through, which, modern, philosophic, thought, gained, its, characteristic, self, confidence, and, self, consciousness, according, to, historian, roy, porter, the, liberation, of, the, human, mind, from, a, dogmatic, state, of, ignorance, is, the, epitome, of, what, the, age, of, enlightenment, was, trying, to, capture, bertrand, russell, saw, the, enlightenment, as, a, phase, in, a, progressive, development, which, began, in, antiquity, and, that, reason, and, challenges, to, the, established, order, were, constant, ideals, throughout, that, time, russell, said, that, the, enlightenment, was, ultimately, born, out, of, the, protestant, reaction, against, the, catholic, counter, reformation, and, that, philosophical, views, such, as, affinity, for, democracy, against, monarchy, originated, among, 16th, century, protestants, to, justify, their, desire, to, break, away, from, the, catholic, church, although, many, of, these, philosophical, ideals, were, picked, up, by, catholics, russell, argues, that, by, the, 18th, century, the, enlightenment, was, the, principal, manifestation, of, the, schism, that, began, with, martin, luther, jonathan, israel, rejects, the, attempts, of, postmodern, and, marxian, historians, to, understand, the, revolutionary, ideas, of, the, period, purely, as, by, products, of, social, and, economic, transformations, he, instead, focuses, on, the, history, of, ideas, in, the, period, from, 1650, to, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, and, claims, that, it, was, the, ideas, themselves, that, caused, the, change, that, eventually, led, to, the, revolutions, of, the, latter, half, of, the, 18th, century, and, the, early, 19th, century, israel, argues, that, until, the, 1650s, western, civilization, was, based, on, a, largely, shared, core, of, faith, tradition, and, authority, there, is, little, consensus, on, the, precise, beginning, of, the, age, of, enlightenment, though, several, historians, and, philosophers, argue, that, it, was, marked, by, descartes, 1637, philosophy, of, cogito, ergo, sum, i, think, therefore, i, am, which, shifted, the, epistemological, basis, from, external, authority, to, internal, certainty, in, france, many, cited, the, publication, of, newton, s, principia, mathematica, 1687, which, built, upon, the, work, of, earlier, scientists, and, formulated, the, laws, of, motion, and, universal, gravitation, french, historians, usually, place, the, si, cle, des, lumi, res, century, of, enlightenments, between, 1715, and, 1789, from, the, beginning, of, the, reign, of, louis, xv, until, the, french, revolution, most, scholars, use, the, last, years, of, the, century, often, choosing, the, french, revolution, or, the, beginning, of, the, napoleonic, wars, 1804, as, a, convenient, point, in, time, with, which, to, date, the, end, of, the, enlightenment, in, recent, years, scholars, have, expanded, the, time, span, and, global, perspective, of, the, enlightenment, by, examining, 1, how, european, intellectuals, did, not, work, alone, and, other, people, helped, spread, and, adapt, enlightenment, ideas, 2, how, enlightenment, ideas, were, a, response, to, cross, border, interaction, and, global, integration, and, 3, how, the, enlightenment, continued, throughout, the, nineteenth, century, and, beyond, the, enlightenment, was, not, merely, a, history, of, diffusion, and, was, the, work, of, historical, actors, around, the, world, who, invoked, the, term, for, their, own, specific, purposes, in, the, 1947, book, dialectic, of, enlightenment, frankfurt, school, philosophers, max, horkheimer, and, theodor, w, adorno, argue, enlightenment, understood, in, the, widest, sense, as, the, advance, of, thought, has, always, aimed, at, liberating, human, beings, from, fear, and, installing, them, as, masters, yet, the, wholly, enlightened, earth, radiates, under, the, sign, of, disaster, triumphant, extending, horkheimer, and, adorno, s, argument, intellectual, historian, jason, josephson, storm, argues, that, any, idea, of, the, age, of, enlightenment, as, a, clearly, defined, period, that, is, separate, from, the, earlier, renaissance, and, later, romanticism, or, counter, enlightenment, constitutes, a, myth, storm, points, out, that, there, are, vastly, different, and, mutually, contradictory, periodizations, of, the, enlightenment, depending, on, nation, field, of, study, and, school, of, thought, that, the, term, and, category, of, enlightenment, referring, to, the, scientific, revolution, was, actually, applied, after, the, fact, that, the, enlightenment, did, not, see, an, increase, in, disenchantment, or, the, dominance, of, the, mechanistic, worldview, and, that, a, blur, in, the, early, modern, ideas, of, the, humanities, and, natural, sciences, makes, it, hard, to, circumscribe, a, scientific, revolution, storm, defends, his, categorization, of, the, enlightenment, as, myth, by, noting, the, regulative, role, ideas, of, a, period, of, enlightenment, and, disenchantment, play, in, modern, western, culture, such, that, belief, in, magic, spiritualism, and, even, religion, appears, somewhat, taboo, in, intellectual, strata, in, the, 1970s, study, of, the, enlightenment, expanded, to, include, the, ways, enlightenment, ideas, spread, to, european, colonies, and, how, they, interacted, with, indigenous, cultures, and, how, the, enlightenment, took, place, in, formerly, unstudied, areas, such, as, italy, greece, the, balkans, poland, hungary, and, russia, intellectuals, such, as, robert, darnton, and, j, rgen, habermas, have, focused, on, the, social, conditions, of, the, enlightenment, habermas, described, the, creation, of, the, bourgeois, public, sphere, in, 18th, century, europe, containing, the, new, venues, and, modes, of, communication, allowing, for, rational, exchange, habermas, said, that, the, public, sphere, was, bourgeois, egalitarian, rational, and, independent, from, the, state, making, it, the, ideal, venue, for, intellectuals, to, critically, examine, contemporary, politics, and, society, away, from, the, interference, of, established, authority, while, the, public, sphere, is, generally, an, integral, component, of, the, social, study, of, the, enlightenment, other, historians, have, questioned, whether, the, public, sphere, had, these, characteristics, in, contrast, to, the, intellectual, historiographical, approach, of, the, enlightenment, which, examines, the, various, currents, or, discourses, of, intellectual, thought, within, the, european, context, during, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, the, cultural, or, social, approach, examines, the, changes, that, occurred, in, european, society, and, culture, this, approach, studies, the, process, of, changing, sociabilities, and, cultural, practices, during, the, enlightenment, one, of, the, primary, elements, of, the, culture, of, the, enlightenment, was, the, rise, of, the, public, sphere, a, realm, of, communication, marked, by, new, arenas, of, debate, more, open, and, accessible, forms, of, urban, public, space, and, sociability, and, an, explosion, of, print, culture, in, the, late, 17th, century, and, 18th, century, elements, of, the, public, sphere, included, that, it, was, egalitarian, that, it, discussed, the, domain, of, common, concern, and, that, argument, was, founded, on, reason, habermas, uses, the, term, common, concern, to, describe, those, areas, of, political, social, knowledge, and, discussion, that, were, previously, the, exclusive, territory, of, the, state, and, religious, authorities, now, open, to, critical, examination, by, the, public, sphere, the, values, of, this, bourgeois, public, sphere, included, holding, reason, to, be, supreme, considering, everything, to, be, open, to, criticism, the, public, sphere, is, critical, and, the, opposition, of, secrecy, of, all, sorts, the, creation, of, the, public, sphere, has, been, associated, with, two, long, term, historical, trends, the, rise, of, the, modern, nation, state, and, the, rise, of, capitalism, the, modern, nation, state, in, its, consolidation, of, public, power, created, by, counterpoint, a, private, realm, of, society, independent, of, the, state, which, allowed, for, the, public, sphere, capitalism, also, increased, society, s, autonomy, and, self, awareness, as, well, as, an, increasing, need, for, the, exchange, of, information, as, the, nascent, public, sphere, expanded, it, embraced, a, large, variety, of, institutions, and, the, most, commonly, cited, were, coffee, houses, and, caf, s, salons, and, the, literary, public, sphere, figuratively, localized, in, the, republic, of, letters, in, france, the, creation, of, the, public, sphere, was, helped, by, the, aristocracy, s, move, from, the, king, s, palace, at, versailles, to, paris, in, about, 1720, since, their, rich, spending, stimulated, the, trade, in, luxuries, and, artistic, creations, especially, fine, paintings, the, context, for, the, rise, of, the, public, sphere, was, the, economic, and, social, change, commonly, associated, with, the, industrial, revolution, economic, expansion, increasing, urbanization, rising, population, and, improving, communications, in, comparison, to, the, stagnation, of, the, previous, century, rising, efficiency, in, production, techniques, and, communication, lowered, the, prices, of, consumer, goods, and, increased, the, amount, and, variety, of, goods, available, to, consumers, including, the, literature, essential, to, the, public, sphere, meanwhile, the, colonial, experience, most, european, states, had, colonial, empires, in, the, 18th, century, began, to, expose, european, society, to, extremely, heterogeneous, cultures, leading, to, the, breaking, down, of, barriers, between, cultural, systems, religious, divides, gender, differences, and, geographical, areas, the, word, public, implies, the, highest, level, of, inclusivity, the, public, sphere, by, definition, should, be, open, to, all, however, this, sphere, was, only, public, to, relative, degrees, enlightenment, thinkers, frequently, contrasted, their, conception, of, the, public, with, that, of, the, people, condorcet, contrasted, opinion, with, populace, marmontel, the, opinion, of, men, of, letters, with, the, opinion, of, the, multitude, and, d, alembert, the, truly, enlightened, public, with, the, blind, and, noisy, multitude, additionally, most, institutions, of, the, public, sphere, excluded, both, women, and, the, lower, classes, cross, class, influences, occurred, through, noble, and, lower, class, participation, in, areas, such, as, the, coffeehouses, and, the, masonic, lodges, because, of, the, focus, on, reason, over, superstition, the, enlightenment, cultivated, the, arts, emphasis, on, learning, art, and, music, became, more, widespread, especially, with, the, growing, middle, class, areas, of, study, such, as, literature, philosophy, science, and, the, fine, arts, increasingly, explored, subject, matter, to, which, the, general, public, in, addition, to, the, previously, more, segregated, professionals, and, patrons, could, relate, as, musicians, depended, more, on, public, support, public, concerts, became, increasingly, popular, and, helped, supplement, performers, and, composers, incomes, the, concerts, also, helped, them, to, reach, a, wider, audience, handel, for, example, epitomized, this, with, his, highly, public, musical, activities, in, london, he, gained, considerable, fame, there, with, performances, of, his, operas, and, oratorios, the, music, of, haydn, and, mozart, with, their, viennese, classical, styles, are, usually, regarded, as, being, the, most, in, line, with, the, enlightenment, ideals, the, desire, to, explore, record, and, systematize, knowledge, had, a, meaningful, impact, on, music, publications, rousseau, s, dictionnaire, de, musique, published, 1767, in, geneva, and, 1768, in, paris, was, a, leading, text, in, the, late, 18th, century, this, widely, available, dictionary, gave, short, definitions, of, words, like, genius, and, taste, and, was, clearly, influenced, by, the, enlightenment, movement, another, text, influenced, by, enlightenment, values, was, charles, burney, s, a, general, history, of, music, from, the, earliest, ages, to, the, present, period, 1776, which, was, a, historical, survey, and, an, attempt, to, rationalize, elements, in, music, systematically, over, time, recently, musicologists, have, shown, renewed, interest, in, the, ideas, and, consequences, of, the, enlightenment, for, example, rose, rosengard, subotnik, s, deconstructive, variations, subtitled, music, and, reason, in, western, society, compares, mozart, s, die, zauberfl, te, 1791, using, the, enlightenment, and, romantic, perspectives, and, concludes, that, the, work, is, an, ideal, musical, representation, of, the, enlightenment, as, the, economy, and, the, middle, class, expanded, there, was, an, increasing, number, of, amateur, musicians, one, manifestation, of, this, involved, women, who, became, more, involved, with, music, on, a, social, level, women, were, already, engaged, in, professional, roles, as, singers, and, increased, their, presence, in, the, amateur, performers, scene, especially, with, keyboard, music, music, publishers, began, to, print, music, that, amateurs, could, understand, and, play, the, majority, of, the, works, that, were, published, were, for, keyboard, voice, and, keyboard, and, chamber, ensemble, after, these, initial, genres, were, popularized, from, the, mid, century, on, amateur, groups, sang, choral, music, which, then, became, a, new, trend, for, publishers, to, capitalize, on, the, increasing, study, of, the, fine, arts, as, well, as, access, to, amateur, friendly, published, works, led, to, more, people, becoming, interested, in, reading, and, discussing, music, music, magazines, reviews, and, critical, works, which, suited, amateurs, as, well, as, connoisseurs, began, to, surface, the, philosophes, spent, a, great, deal, of, energy, disseminating, their, ideas, among, educated, men, and, women, in, cosmopolitan, cities, they, used, many, venues, some, of, them, quite, new, the, term, republic, of, letters, was, coined, in, 1664, by, pierre, bayle, in, his, journal, nouvelles, de, la, republique, des, lettres, towards, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, the, editor, of, histoire, de, la, r, publique, des, lettres, en, france, a, literary, survey, described, the, republic, of, letters, as, being, in, the, midst, of, all, the, governments, that, decide, the, fate, of, men, in, the, bosom, of, so, many, states, the, majority, of, them, despotic, there, exists, a, certain, realm, which, holds, sway, only, over, the, mind, that, we, honor, with, the, name, republic, because, it, preserves, a, measure, of, independence, and, because, it, is, almost, its, essence, to, be, free, it, is, the, realm, of, talent, and, of, thought, the, republic, of, letters, was, the, sum, of, a, number, of, enlightenment, ideals, an, egalitarian, realm, governed, by, knowledge, that, could, act, across, political, boundaries, and, rival, state, power, it, was, a, forum, that, supported, free, public, examination, of, questions, regarding, religion, or, legislation, kant, considered, written, communication, essential, to, his, conception, of, the, public, sphere, once, everyone, was, a, part, of, the, reading, public, then, society, could, be, said, to, be, enlightened, the, people, who, participated, in, the, republic, of, letters, such, as, diderot, and, voltaire, are, frequently, known, today, as, important, enlightenment, figures, indeed, the, men, who, wrote, diderot, s, encyclop, die, arguably, formed, a, microcosm, of, the, larger, republic, many, women, played, an, essential, part, in, the, french, enlightenment, because, of, the, role, they, played, as, salonni, res, in, parisian, salons, as, the, contrast, to, the, male, philosophes, the, salon, was, the, principal, social, institution, of, the, republic, and, became, the, civil, working, spaces, of, the, project, of, enlightenment, women, as, salonni, res, were, the, legitimate, governors, of, potentially, unruly, discourse, that, took, place, within, while, women, were, marginalized, in, the, public, culture, of, the, old, regime, the, french, revolution, destroyed, the, old, cultural, and, economic, restraints, of, patronage, and, corporatism, guilds, opening, french, society, to, female, participation, particularly, in, the, literary, sphere, in, france, the, established, men, of, letters, gens, de, lettres, had, fused, with, the, elites, les, grands, of, french, society, by, the, mid, 18th, century, this, led, to, the, creation, of, an, oppositional, literary, sphere, grub, street, the, domain, of, a, multitude, of, versifiers, and, would, be, authors, these, men, came, to, london, to, become, authors, only, to, discover, that, the, literary, market, could, not, support, large, numbers, of, writers, who, in, any, case, were, very, poorly, remunerated, by, the, publishing, bookselling, guilds, the, writers, of, grub, street, the, grub, street, hacks, were, left, feeling, bitter, about, the, relative, success, of, the, men, of, letters, and, found, an, outlet, for, their, literature, which, was, typified, by, the, libelle, written, mostly, in, the, form, of, pamphlets, the, libelles, slandered, the, court, the, church, the, aristocracy, the, academies, the, salons, everything, elevated, and, respectable, including, the, monarchy, itself, le, gazetier, cuirass, by, charles, th, veneau, de, morande, was, a, prototype, of, the, genre, it, was, grub, street, literature, that, was, most, read, by, the, public, during, the, enlightenment, according, to, darnton, more, importantly, the, grub, street, hacks, inherited, the, revolutionary, spirit, once, displayed, by, the, philosophes, and, paved, the, way, for, the, french, revolution, by, desacralizing, figures, of, political, moral, and, religious, authority, in, france, the, increased, consumption, of, reading, materials, of, all, sorts, was, one, of, the, key, features, of, the, social, enlightenment, developments, in, the, industrial, revolution, allowed, consumer, goods, to, be, produced, in, greater, quantities, at, lower, prices, encouraging, the, spread, of, books, pamphlets, newspapers, and, journals, media, of, the, transmission, of, ideas, and, attitudes, commercial, development, likewise, increased, the, demand, for, information, along, with, rising, populations, and, increased, urbanisation, however, demand, for, reading, material, extended, outside, of, the, realm, of, the, commercial, and, outside, the, realm, of, the, upper, and, middle, classes, as, evidenced, by, the, biblioth, que, bleue, literacy, rates, are, difficult, to, gauge, but, in, france, the, rates, doubled, over, the, course, of, the, 18th, century, reflecting, the, decreasing, influence, of, religion, the, number, of, books, about, science, and, art, published, in, paris, doubled, from, 1720, to, 1780, while, the, number, of, books, about, religion, dropped, to, just, one, tenth, of, the, total, reading, underwent, serious, changes, in, the, 18th, century, in, particular, rolf, engelsing, has, argued, for, the, existence, of, a, reading, revolution, until, 1750, reading, was, done, intensively, people, tended, to, own, a, small, number, of, books, and, read, them, repeatedly, often, to, small, audience, after, 1750, people, began, to, read, extensively, finding, as, many, books, as, they, could, increasingly, reading, them, alone, this, is, supported, by, increasing, literacy, rates, particularly, among, women, the, vast, majority, of, the, reading, public, could, not, afford, to, own, a, private, library, and, while, most, of, the, state, run, universal, libraries, set, up, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, were, open, to, the, public, they, were, not, the, only, sources, of, reading, material, on, one, end, of, the, spectrum, was, the, biblioth, que, bleue, a, collection, of, cheaply, produced, books, published, in, troyes, france, intended, for, a, largely, rural, and, semi, literate, audience, these, books, included, almanacs, retellings, of, medieval, romances, and, condensed, versions, of, popular, novels, among, other, things, while, some, historians, have, argued, against, the, enlightenment, s, penetration, into, the, lower, classes, the, biblioth, que, bleue, represents, at, least, a, desire, to, participate, in, enlightenment, sociability, moving, up, the, classes, a, variety, of, institutions, offered, readers, access, to, material, without, needing, to, buy, anything, libraries, that, lent, out, their, material, for, a, small, price, started, to, appear, and, occasionally, bookstores, would, offer, a, small, lending, library, to, their, patrons, coffee, houses, commonly, offered, books, journals, and, sometimes, even, popular, novels, to, their, customers, tatler, and, the, spectator, two, influential, periodicals, sold, from, 1709, to, 1714, were, closely, associated, with, coffee, house, culture, in, london, being, both, read, and, produced, in, various, establishments, in, the, city, this, is, an, example, of, the, triple, or, even, quadruple, function, of, the, coffee, house, reading, material, was, often, obtained, read, discussed, and, even, produced, on, the, premises, it, is, difficult, to, determine, what, people, actually, read, during, the, enlightenment, for, example, examining, the, catalogs, of, private, libraries, gives, an, image, skewed, in, favor, of, the, classes, wealthy, enough, to, afford, libraries, and, also, ignores, censored, works, unlikely, to, be, publicly, acknowledged, for, this, reason, a, study, of, publishing, would, be, much, more, fruitful, for, discerning, reading, habits, across, continental, europe, but, in, france, especially, booksellers, and, publishers, had, to, negotiate, censorship, laws, of, varying, strictness, for, example, the, encyclop, die, narrowly, escaped, seizure, and, had, to, be, saved, by, malesherbes, the, man, in, charge, of, the, french, censor, indeed, many, publishing, companies, were, conveniently, located, outside, france, so, as, to, avoid, overzealous, french, censors, they, would, smuggle, their, merchandise, across, the, border, where, it, would, then, be, transported, to, clandestine, booksellers, or, small, time, peddlers, the, records, of, clandestine, booksellers, may, give, a, better, representation, of, what, literate, frenchmen, might, have, truly, read, since, their, clandestine, nature, provided, a, less, restrictive, product, choice, in, one, case, political, books, were, the, most, popular, category, primarily, libels, and, pamphlets, readers, were, more, interested, in, sensationalist, stories, about, criminals, and, political, corruption, than, they, were, in, political, theory, itself, the, second, most, popular, category, general, works, those, books, that, did, not, have, a, dominant, motif, and, that, contained, something, to, offend, almost, everyone, in, authority, demonstrated, a, high, demand, for, generally, low, brow, subversive, literature, however, these, works, never, became, part, of, literary, canon, and, are, largely, forgotten, today, as, a, result, a, healthy, legal, publishing, industry, existed, throughout, europe, although, established, publishers, and, book, sellers, occasionally, ran, afoul, of, the, law, for, example, the, encyclop, die, condemned, by, both, the, king, and, clement, xii, nevertheless, found, its, way, into, print, with, the, help, of, the, aforementioned, malesherbes, and, creative, use, of, french, censorship, law, however, many, works, were, sold, without, running, into, any, legal, trouble, at, all, borrowing, records, from, libraries, in, england, germany, and, north, america, indicate, that, more, than, 70, of, books, borrowed, were, novels, less, than, 1, of, the, books, were, of, a, religious, nature, indicating, the, general, trend, of, declining, religiosity, a, genre, that, greatly, rose, in, importance, was, that, of, scientific, literature, natural, history, in, particular, became, increasingly, popular, among, the, upper, classes, works, of, natural, history, include, ren, antoine, ferchault, de, r, aumur, s, histoire, naturelle, des, insectes, and, jacques, gautier, d, agoty, s, la, myologie, compl, te, ou, description, de, tous, les, muscles, du, corps, humain, 1746, outside, ancien, r, gime, france, natural, history, was, an, important, part, of, medicine, and, industry, encompassing, the, fields, of, botany, zoology, meteorology, hydrology, and, mineralogy, students, in, enlightenment, universities, and, academies, were, taught, these, subjects, to, prepare, them, for, careers, as, diverse, as, medicine, and, theology, as, shown, by, matthew, daniel, eddy, natural, history, in, this, context, was, a, very, middle, class, pursuit, and, operated, as, a, fertile, trading, zone, for, the, interdisciplinary, exchange, of, diverse, scientific, ideas, the, target, audience, of, natural, history, was, french, upper, class, evidenced, more, by, the, specific, discourse, of, the, genre, than, by, the, generally, high, prices, of, its, works, naturalists, catered, to, upper, class, desire, for, erudition, many, texts, had, an, explicit, instructive, purpose, however, natural, history, was, often, a, political, affair, as, emma, spary, writes, the, classifications, used, by, naturalists, slipped, between, the, natural, world, and, the, social, to, establish, not, only, the, expertise, of, the, naturalists, over, the, natural, but, also, the, dominance, of, the, natural, over, the, social, the, idea, of, taste, le, go, t, was, a, social, indicator, to, truly, be, able, to, categorize, nature, one, had, to, have, the, proper, taste, an, ability, of, discretion, shared, by, all, members, of, the, upper, class, in, this, way, natural, history, spread, many, of, the, scientific, developments, of, the, time, but, also, provided, a, new, source, of, legitimacy, for, the, dominant, class, from, this, basis, naturalists, could, then, develop, their, own, social, ideals, based, on, their, scientific, works, the, first, scientific, and, literary, journals, were, established, during, the, enlightenment, the, first, journal, the, parisian, journal, des, s, avans, appeared, in, 1665, however, it, was, not, until, 1682, that, periodicals, began, to, be, more, widely, produced, french, and, latin, were, the, dominant, languages, of, publication, but, there, was, also, a, steady, demand, for, material, in, german, and, dutch, there, was, generally, low, demand, for, english, publications, on, the, continent, which, was, echoed, by, england, s, similar, lack, of, desire, for, french, works, languages, commanding, less, of, an, international, market, such, as, danish, spanish, and, portuguese, found, journal, success, more, difficult, and, a, more, international, language, was, used, instead, french, slowly, took, over, latin, s, status, as, the, lingua, franca, of, learned, circles, this, in, turn, gave, precedence, to, the, publishing, industry, in, holland, where, the, vast, majority, of, these, french, language, periodicals, were, produced, jonathan, israel, called, the, journals, the, most, influential, cultural, innovation, of, european, intellectual, culture, they, shifted, the, attention, of, the, cultivated, public, away, from, established, authorities, to, novelty, and, innovation, and, instead, promoted, the, enlightened, ideals, of, toleration, and, intellectual, objectivity, being, a, source, of, knowledge, derived, from, science, and, reason, they, were, an, implicit, critique, of, existing, notions, of, universal, truth, monopolized, by, monarchies, parliaments, and, religious, authorities, they, also, advanced, christian, enlightenment, that, upheld, the, legitimacy, of, god, ordained, authority, the, bible, in, which, there, had, to, be, agreement, between, the, biblical, and, natural, theories, although, the, existence, of, dictionaries, and, encyclopedias, spanned, into, ancient, times, the, texts, changed, from, defining, words, in, a, long, running, list, to, far, more, detailed, discussions, of, those, words, in, 18th, century, encyclopedic, dictionaries, the, works, were, part, of, an, enlightenment, movement, to, systematize, knowledge, and, provide, education, to, a, wider, audience, than, the, elite, as, the, 18th, century, progressed, the, content, of, encyclopedias, also, changed, according, to, readers, tastes, volumes, tended, to, focus, more, strongly, on, secular, affairs, particularly, science, and, technology, rather, than, matters, of, theology, along, with, secular, matters, readers, also, favoured, an, alphabetical, ordering, scheme, over, cumbersome, works, arranged, along, thematic, lines, commenting, on, alphabetization, the, historian, charles, porset, has, said, that, as, the, zero, degree, of, taxonomy, alphabetical, order, authorizes, all, reading, strategies, in, this, respect, it, could, be, considered, an, emblem, of, the, enlightenment, for, porset, the, avoidance, of, thematic, and, hierarchical, systems, thus, allows, free, interpretation, of, the, works, and, becomes, an, example, of, egalitarianism, encyclopedias, and, dictionaries, also, became, more, popular, during, the, age, of, enlightenment, as, the, number, of, educated, consumers, who, could, afford, such, texts, began, to, multiply, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 18th, century, the, number, of, dictionaries, and, encyclopedias, published, by, decade, increased, from, 63, between, 1760, and, 1769, to, approximately, 148, in, the, decade, proceeding, the, french, revolution, along, with, growth, in, numbers, dictionaries, and, encyclopedias, also, grew, in, length, often, having, multiple, print, runs, that, sometimes, included, in, supplemented, editions, the, first, technical, dictionary, was, drafted, by, john, harris, and, entitled, lexicon, technicum, or, an, universal, english, dictionary, of, arts, and, sciences, harris, book, avoids, theological, and, biographical, entries, and, instead, concentrates, on, science, and, technology, published, in, 1704, the, lexicon, technicum, was, the, first, book, to, be, written, in, english, that, took, a, methodical, approach, to, describing, mathematics, and, commercial, arithmetic, along, with, the, physical, sciences, and, navigation, other, technical, dictionaries, followed, harris, model, including, ephraim, chambers, cyclopaedia, 1728, which, included, five, editions, and, is, a, substantially, larger, work, than, harris, the, folio, edition, of, the, work, even, included, foldout, engravings, the, cyclopaedia, emphasized, newtonian, theories, lockean, philosophy, and, contained, thorough, examinations, of, technologies, such, as, engraving, brewing, and, dyeing, in, germany, practical, reference, works, intended, for, the, uneducated, majority, became, popular, in, the, 18th, century, the, marperger, curieuses, natur, kunst, berg, gewerk, und, handlungs, lexicon, 1712, explained, terms, that, usefully, described, the, trades, and, scientific, and, commercial, education, jablonksi, allgemeines, lexicon, 1721, was, better, known, than, the, handlungs, lexicon, and, underscored, technical, subjects, rather, than, scientific, theory, for, example, over, five, columns, of, text, were, dedicated, to, wine, while, geometry, and, logic, were, allocated, only, twenty, two, and, seventeen, lines, respectively, the, first, edition, of, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, 1771, was, modelled, along, the, same, lines, as, the, german, lexicons, however, the, prime, example, of, reference, works, that, systematized, scientific, knowledge, in, the, age, of, enlightenment, were, universal, encyclopedias, rather, than, technical, dictionaries, it, was, the, goal, of, universal, encyclopedias, to, record, all, human, knowledge, in, a, comprehensive, reference, work, the, most, well, known, of, these, works, is, diderot, and, d, alembert, s, encyclop, die, ou, dictionnaire, raisonn, des, sciences, des, arts, et, des, m, tiers, the, work, which, began, publication, in, 1751, was, composed, of, 35, volumes, and, over, 71, 000, separate, entries, a, great, number, of, the, entries, were, dedicated, to, describing, the, sciences, and, crafts, in, detail, and, provided, intellectuals, across, europe, with, a, high, quality, survey, of, human, knowledge, in, d, alembert, s, preliminary, discourse, to, the, encyclopedia, of, diderot, the, work, s, goal, to, record, the, extent, of, human, knowledge, in, the, arts, and, sciences, is, outlined, as, an, encyclop, die, it, is, to, set, forth, as, well, as, possible, the, order, and, connection, of, the, parts, of, human, knowledge, as, a, reasoned, dictionary, of, the, sciences, arts, and, trades, it, is, to, contain, the, general, principles, that, form, the, basis, of, each, science, and, each, art, liberal, or, mechanical, and, the, most, essential, facts, that, make, up, the, body, and, substance, of, each, the, massive, work, was, arranged, according, to, a, tree, of, knowledge, the, tree, reflected, the, marked, division, between, the, arts, and, sciences, which, was, largely, a, result, of, the, rise, of, empiricism, both, areas, of, knowledge, were, united, by, philosophy, or, the, trunk, of, the, tree, of, knowledge, the, enlightenment, s, desacrilization, of, religion, was, pronounced, in, the, tree, s, design, particularly, where, theology, accounted, for, a, peripheral, branch, with, black, magic, as, a, close, neighbour, as, the, encyclop, die, gained, popularity, it, was, published, in, quarto, and, octavo, editions, after, 1777, the, quarto, and, octavo, editions, were, much, less, expensive, than, previous, editions, making, the, encyclop, die, more, accessible, to, the, non, elite, robert, darnton, estimates, that, there, were, approximately, 25, 000, copies, of, the, encyclop, die, in, circulation, throughout, france, and, europe, before, the, french, revolution, the, extensive, yet, affordable, encyclopedia, came, to, represent, the, transmission, of, enlightenment, and, scientific, education, to, an, expanding, audience, one, of, the, most, important, developments, that, the, enlightenment, era, brought, to, the, discipline, of, science, was, its, popularization, an, increasingly, literate, population, seeking, knowledge, and, education, in, both, the, arts, and, the, sciences, drove, the, expansion, of, print, culture, and, the, dissemination, of, scientific, learning, the, new, literate, population, was, precipitated, by, a, high, rise, in, the, availability, of, food, this, enabled, many, people, to, rise, out, of, poverty, and, instead, of, paying, more, for, food, they, had, money, for, education, popularization, was, generally, part, of, an, overarching, enlightenment, ideal, that, endeavoured, to, make, information, available, to, the, greatest, number, of, people, as, public, interest, in, natural, philosophy, grew, during, the, 18th, century, public, lecture, courses, and, the, publication, of, popular, texts, opened, up, new, roads, to, money, and, fame, for, amateurs, and, scientists, who, remained, on, the, periphery, of, universities, and, academies, more, formal, works, included, explanations, of, scientific, theories, for, individuals, lacking, the, educational, background, to, comprehend, the, original, scientific, text, newton, s, celebrated, philosophiae, naturalis, principia, mathematica, was, published, in, latin, and, remained, inaccessible, to, readers, without, education, in, the, classics, until, enlightenment, writers, began, to, translate, and, analyze, the, text, in, the, vernacular, the, first, significant, work, that, expressed, scientific, theory, and, knowledge, expressly, for, the, laity, in, the, vernacular, and, with, the, entertainment, of, readers, in, mind, was, bernard, de, fontenelle, s, conversations, on, the, plurality, of, worlds, 1686, the, book, was, produced, specifically, for, women, with, an, interest, in, scientific, writing, and, inspired, a, variety, of, similar, works, these, popular, works, were, written, in, a, discursive, style, which, was, laid, out, much, more, clearly, for, the, reader, than, the, complicated, articles, treatises, and, books, published, by, the, academies, and, scientists, charles, leadbetter, s, astronomy, 1727, was, advertised, as, a, work, entirely, new, that, would, include, short, and, easie, rules, and, astronomical, tables, the, first, french, introduction, to, newtonianism, and, the, principia, was, el, ments, de, la, philosophie, de, newton, published, by, voltaire, in, 1738, milie, du, ch, telet, s, translation, of, the, principia, published, after, her, death, in, 1756, also, helped, to, spread, newton, s, theories, beyond, scientific, academies, and, the, university, writing, for, a, growing, female, audience, francesco, algarotti, published, il, newtonianism, per, le, dame, which, was, a, tremendously, popular, work, and, was, translated, from, italian, into, english, by, elizabeth, carter, a, similar, introduction, to, newtonianism, for, women, was, produced, by, henry, pemberton, his, a, view, of, sir, isaac, newton, s, philosophy, was, published, by, subscription, extant, records, of, subscribers, show, that, women, from, a, wide, range, of, social, standings, purchased, the, book, indicating, the, growing, number, of, scientifically, inclined, female, readers, among, the, middling, class, during, the, enlightenment, women, also, began, producing, popular, scientific, works, sarah, trimmer, wrote, a, successful, natural, history, textbook, for, children, titled, the, easy, introduction, to, the, knowledge, of, nature, 1782, which, was, published, for, many, years, in, eleven, editions, most, work, on, the, enlightenment, emphasizes, the, ideals, discussed, by, intellectuals, rather, than, the, actual, state, of, education, at, the, time, leading, educational, theorists, like, england, s, john, locke, and, switzerland, s, jean, jacques, rousseau, both, emphasized, the, importance, of, shaping, young, minds, early, by, the, late, enlightenment, there, was, a, rising, demand, for, a, more, universal, approach, to, education, particularly, after, the, american, revolution, and, the, french, revolution, the, predominant, educational, psychology, from, the, 1750s, onward, especially, in, northern, european, countries, was, associationism, the, notion, that, the, mind, associates, or, dissociates, ideas, through, repeated, routines, in, addition, to, being, conducive, to, enlightenment, ideologies, of, liberty, self, determination, and, personal, responsibility, it, offered, a, practical, theory, of, the, mind, that, allowed, teachers, to, transform, longstanding, forms, of, print, and, manuscript, culture, into, effective, graphic, tools, of, learning, for, the, lower, and, middle, orders, of, society, children, were, taught, to, memorize, facts, through, oral, and, graphic, methods, that, originated, during, the, renaissance, many, of, the, leading, universities, associated, with, enlightenment, progressive, principles, were, located, in, northern, europe, with, the, most, renowned, being, the, universities, of, leiden, g, ttingen, halle, montpellier, uppsala, and, edinburgh, these, universities, especially, edinburgh, produced, professors, whose, ideas, had, a, significant, impact, on, britain, s, north, american, colonies, and, later, the, american, republic, within, the, natural, sciences, edinburgh, s, medical, school, also, led, the, way, in, chemistry, anatomy, and, pharmacology, in, other, parts, of, europe, the, universities, and, schools, of, france, and, most, of, europe, were, bastions, of, traditionalism, and, were, not, hospitable, to, the, enlightenment, in, france, the, major, exception, was, the, medical, university, at, montpellier, the, history, of, academies, in, france, during, the, enlightenment, begins, with, the, academy, of, science, founded, in, 1635, in, paris, it, was, closely, tied, to, the, french, state, acting, as, an, extension, of, a, government, seriously, lacking, in, scientists, it, helped, promote, and, organize, new, disciplines, and, it, trained, new, scientists, it, also, contributed, to, the, enhancement, of, scientists, social, status, considering, them, to, be, the, most, useful, of, all, citizens, academies, demonstrate, the, rising, interest, in, science, along, with, its, increasing, secularization, as, evidenced, by, the, small, number, of, clerics, who, were, members, 13, the, presence, of, the, french, academies, in, the, public, sphere, cannot, be, attributed, to, their, membership, as, although, the, majority, of, their, members, were, bourgeois, the, exclusive, institution, was, only, open, to, elite, parisian, scholars, they, perceived, themselves, as, interpreters, of, the, sciences, for, the, people, for, example, it, was, with, this, in, mind, that, academicians, took, it, upon, themselves, to, disprove, the, popular, pseudo, science, of, mesmerism, the, strongest, contribution, of, the, french, academies, to, the, public, sphere, comes, from, the, concours, acad, miques, roughly, translated, as, academic, contests, they, sponsored, throughout, france, these, academic, contests, were, perhaps, the, most, public, of, any, institution, during, the, enlightenment, the, practice, of, contests, dated, back, to, the, middle, ages, and, was, revived, in, the, mid, 17th, century, the, subject, matter, had, previously, been, generally, religious, and, or, monarchical, featuring, essays, poetry, and, painting, however, by, roughly, 1725, this, subject, matter, had, radically, expanded, and, diversified, including, royal, propaganda, philosophical, battles, and, critical, ruminations, on, the, social, and, political, institutions, of, the, old, regime, topics, of, public, controversy, were, also, discussed, such, as, the, theories, of, newton, and, descartes, the, slave, trade, women, s, education, and, justice, in, france, more, importantly, the, contests, were, open, to, all, and, the, enforced, anonymity, of, each, submission, guaranteed, that, neither, gender, nor, social, rank, would, determine, the, judging, indeed, although, the, vast, majority, of, participants, belonged, to, the, wealthier, strata, of, society, the, liberal, arts, the, clergy, the, judiciary, and, the, medical, profession, there, were, some, cases, of, the, popular, classes, submitting, essays, and, even, winning, similarly, a, significant, number, of, women, participated, and, won, the, competitions, of, a, total, of, 2, 300, prize, competitions, offered, in, france, women, won, 49, perhaps, a, small, number, by, modern, standards, but, very, significant, in, an, age, in, which, most, women, did, not, have, any, academic, training, indeed, the, majority, of, the, winning, entries, were, for, poetry, competitions, a, genre, commonly, stressed, in, women, s, education, in, england, the, royal, society, of, london, played, a, significant, role, in, the, public, sphere, and, the, spread, of, enlightenment, ideas, it, was, founded, by, a, group, of, independent, scientists, and, given, a, royal, charter, in, 1662, the, society, played, a, large, role, in, spreading, robert, boyle, s, experimental, philosophy, around, europe, and, acted, as, a, clearinghouse, for, intellectual, correspondence, and, exchange, boyle, was, a, founder, of, the, experimental, world, in, which, scientists, now, live, and, operate, and, his, method, based, knowledge, on, experimentation, which, had, to, be, witnessed, to, provide, proper, empirical, legitimacy, this, is, where, the, royal, society, came, into, play, witnessing, had, to, be, a, collective, act, and, the, royal, society, s, assembly, rooms, were, ideal, locations, for, relatively, public, demonstrations, however, not, just, any, witness, was, considered, to, be, credible, oxford, professors, were, accounted, more, reliable, witnesses, than, oxfordshire, peasants, two, factors, were, taken, into, account, a, witness, s, knowledge, in, the, area, and, a, witness, s, moral, constitution, in, other, words, only, civil, society, were, considered, for, boyle, s, public, salons, were, places, where, philosophes, were, reunited, and, discussed, old, actual, or, new, ideas, this, led, to, salons, being, the, birthplace, of, intellectual, and, enlightened, ideas, coffeehouses, were, especially, important, to, the, spread, of, knowledge, during, the, enlightenment, because, they, created, a, unique, environment, in, which, people, from, many, different, walks, of, life, gathered, and, shared, ideas, they, were, frequently, criticized, by, nobles, who, feared, the, possibility, of, an, environment, in, which, class, and, its, accompanying, titles, and, privileges, were, disregarded, such, an, environment, was, especially, intimidating, to, monarchs, who, derived, much, of, their, power, from, the, disparity, between, classes, of, people, if, the, different, classes, joined, together, under, the, influence, of, enlightenment, thinking, they, might, recognize, the, all, encompassing, oppression, and, abuses, of, their, monarchs, and, because, of, the, numbers, of, their, members, might, be, able, to, successfully, revolt, monarchs, also, resented, the, idea, of, their, subjects, convening, as, one, to, discuss, political, matters, especially, matters, of, foreign, affairs, rulers, thought, political, affairs, were, their, business, only, a, result, of, their, divine, right, to, rule, coffeeshops, became, homes, away, from, home, for, many, who, sought, to, engage, in, discourse, with, their, neighbors, and, discuss, intriguing, and, thought, provoking, matters, from, philosophy, to, politics, coffeehouses, were, essential, to, the, enlightenment, for, they, were, centers, of, free, thinking, and, self, discovery, although, many, coffeehouse, patrons, were, scholars, many, were, not, coffeehouses, attracted, a, diverse, set, of, people, including, the, educated, wealthy, and, bourgeois, as, well, as, the, lower, classes, patrons, being, doctors, lawyers, merchants, represented, almost, all, classes, so, the, coffeeshop, environment, sparked, fear, in, those, who, wanted, to, preserve, class, distinction, one, of, the, most, popular, critiques, of, the, coffeehouse, said, that, it, allowed, promiscuous, association, among, people, from, different, rungs, of, the, social, ladder, from, the, artisan, to, the, aristocrat, and, was, therefore, compared, to, noah, s, ark, receiving, all, types, of, animals, clean, and, unclean, this, unique, culture, served, as, a, catalyst, for, journalism, when, joseph, addison, and, richard, steele, recognized, its, potential, as, an, audience, together, steele, and, addison, published, the, spectator, 1711, a, daily, publication, which, aimed, through, fictional, narrator, mr, spectator, to, both, entertain, and, provoke, discussion, on, serious, philosophical, matters, the, first, english, coffeehouse, opened, in, oxford, in, 1650, brian, cowan, said, that, oxford, coffeehouses, developed, into, penny, universities, offering, a, locus, of, learning, that, was, less, formal, than, at, structured, institutions, these, penny, universities, occupied, a, significant, position, in, oxford, academic, life, as, they, were, frequented, by, those, consequently, referred, to, as, the, virtuosi, who, conducted, their, research, on, some, of, the, premises, according, to, cowan, the, coffeehouse, was, a, place, for, like, minded, scholars, to, congregate, to, read, as, well, as, learn, from, and, to, debate, with, each, other, but, was, emphatically, not, a, university, institution, and, the, discourse, there, was, of, a, far, different, order, than, any, university, tutorial, the, caf, procope, was, established, in, paris, in, 1686, and, by, the, 1720s, there, were, around, 400, caf, s, in, the, city, the, caf, procope, in, particular, became, a, center, of, enlightenment, welcoming, such, celebrities, as, voltaire, and, rousseau, the, caf, procope, was, where, diderot, and, d, alembert, decided, to, create, the, encyclop, die, the, caf, s, were, one, of, the, various, nerve, centers, for, bruits, publics, public, noise, or, rumour, these, bruits, were, allegedly, a, much, better, source, of, information, than, were, the, actual, newspapers, available, at, the, time, the, debating, societies, are, an, example, of, the, public, sphere, during, the, enlightenment, their, origins, include, in, the, late, 1770s, popular, debating, societies, began, to, move, into, more, genteel, rooms, a, change, which, helped, establish, a, new, standard, of, sociability, the, backdrop, to, these, developments, was, an, explosion, of, interest, in, the, theory, and, practice, of, public, elocution, the, debating, societies, were, commercial, enterprises, that, responded, to, this, demand, sometimes, very, successfully, some, societies, welcomed, from, 800, to, 1, 200, spectators, per, night, the, debating, societies, discussed, an, extremely, wide, range, of, topics, before, the, enlightenment, most, intellectual, debates, revolved, around, confessional, that, is, catholic, lutheran, reformed, calvinist, or, anglican, issues, debated, primarily, to, establish, which, bloc, of, faith, ought, to, have, the, monopoly, of, truth, and, a, god, given, title, to, authority, after, enlightenment, everything, that, previously, had, been, rooted, in, tradition, was, questioned, and, often, replaced, by, new, concepts, after, the, second, half, of, the, 17th, century, and, during, the, 18th, century, a, general, process, of, rationalization, and, secularization, set, in, and, confessional, disputes, were, reduced, to, a, secondary, status, in, favor, of, the, escalating, contest, between, faith, and, incredulity, in, addition, to, debates, on, religion, societies, discussed, issues, such, as, politics, and, the, role, of, women, however, the, critical, subject, matter, of, these, debates, did, not, necessarily, translate, into, opposition, to, the, government, the, results, of, the, debate, quite, frequently, upheld, the, status, quo, from, a, historical, standpoint, one, of, the, most, important, features, of, the, debating, society, was, their, openness, to, the, public, as, women, attended, and, even, participated, in, almost, every, debating, society, which, were, likewise, open, to, all, classes, providing, they, could, pay, the, entrance, fee, once, inside, spectators, were, able, to, participate, in, a, largely, egalitarian, form, of, sociability, that, helped, spread, enlightenment, ideas, historians, have, debated, the, extent, to, which, the, secret, network, of, freemasonry, was, a, main, factor, in, the, enlightenment, leaders, of, the, enlightenment, included, freemasons, such, as, diderot, montesquieu, voltaire, lessing, pope, horace, walpole, sir, robert, walpole, mozart, goethe, frederick, the, great, benjamin, franklin, and, george, washington, norman, davies, said, freemasonry, was, a, powerful, force, on, behalf, of, liberalism, in, europe, from, about, 1700, to, the, twentieth, century, it, expanded, during, the, enlightenment, reaching, practically, every, country, in, europe, it, was, especially, attractive, to, powerful, aristocrats, and, politicians, as, well, as, intellectuals, artists, and, political, activists, during, the, enlightenment, freemasons, comprised, an, international, network, of, like, minded, men, often, meeting, in, secret, in, ritualistic, programs, at, their, lodges, they, promoted, the, ideals, of, the, enlightenment, and, helped, diffuse, these, values, across, britain, france, and, other, places, freemasonry, as, a, systematic, creed, with, its, own, myths, values, and, rituals, originated, in, scotland, c, 1600, and, spread, to, england, and, then, across, the, continent, in, the, 18th, century, they, fostered, new, codes, of, conduct, including, a, communal, understanding, of, liberty, and, equality, inherited, from, guild, sociability, liberty, fraternity, and, equality, scottish, soldiers, and, jacobite, scots, brought, to, the, continent, ideals, of, fraternity, which, reflected, not, the, local, system, of, scottish, customs, but, the, institutions, and, ideals, originating, in, the, english, revolution, against, royal, absolutism, freemasonry, was, particularly, prevalent, in, france, by, 1789, there, were, perhaps, as, many, as, 100, 000, french, masons, making, freemasonry, the, most, popular, of, all, enlightenment, associations, the, freemasons, displayed, a, passion, for, secrecy, and, created, new, degrees, and, ceremonies, similar, societies, partially, imitating, freemasonry, emerged, in, france, germany, sweden, and, russia, one, example, was, the, illuminati, founded, in, bavaria, in, 1776, which, was, copied, after, the, freemasons, but, was, never, part, of, the, movement, the, name, itself, translates, to, enlightened, chosen, to, reflect, their, original, intent, to, promote, the, values, of, the, movement, the, illuminati, was, an, overtly, political, group, which, most, masonic, lodges, decidedly, were, not, masonic, lodges, created, a, private, model, for, public, affairs, they, reconstituted, the, polity, and, established, a, constitutional, form, of, self, government, complete, with, constitutions, and, laws, elections, and, representatives, in, other, words, the, micro, society, set, up, within, the, lodges, constituted, a, normative, model, for, society, as, a, whole, this, was, especially, true, on, the, continent, when, the, first, lodges, began, to, appear, in, the, 1730s, their, embodiment, of, british, values, was, often, seen, as, threatening, by, state, authorities, for, example, the, parisian, lodge, that, met, in, the, mid, 1720s, was, composed, of, english, jacobite, exiles, furthermore, freemasons, across, europe, explicitly, linked, themselves, to, the, enlightenment, as, a, whole, for, example, in, french, lodges, the, line, as, the, means, to, be, enlightened, i, search, for, the, enlightened, was, a, part, of, their, initiation, rites, british, lodges, assigned, themselves, the, duty, to, initiate, the, unenlightened, this, did, not, necessarily, link, lodges, to, the, irreligious, but, neither, did, this, exclude, them, from, the, occasional, heresy, in, fact, many, lodges, praised, the, grand, architect, the, masonic, terminology, for, the, deistic, divine, being, who, created, a, scientifically, ordered, universe, german, historian, reinhart, koselleck, claimed, on, the, continent, there, were, two, social, structures, that, left, a, decisive, imprint, on, the, age, of, enlightenment, the, republic, of, letters, and, the, masonic, lodges, scottish, professor, thomas, munck, argues, that, although, the, masons, did, promote, international, and, cross, social, contacts, which, were, essentially, non, religious, and, broadly, in, agreement, with, enlightened, values, they, can, hardly, be, described, as, a, major, radical, or, reformist, network, in, their, own, right, many, of, the, masons, values, seemed, to, greatly, appeal, to, enlightenment, values, and, thinkers, diderot, discusses, the, link, between, freemason, ideals, and, the, enlightenment, in, d, alembert, s, dream, exploring, masonry, as, a, way, of, spreading, enlightenment, beliefs, historian, margaret, jacob, stresses, the, importance, of, the, masons, in, indirectly, inspiring, enlightened, political, thought, on, the, negative, side, daniel, roche, contests, claims, that, masonry, promoted, egalitarianism, and, he, argues, the, lodges, only, attracted, men, of, similar, social, backgrounds, the, presence, of, noble, women, in, the, french, lodges, of, adoption, that, formed, in, the, 1780s, was, largely, due, to, the, close, ties, shared, between, these, lodges, and, aristocratic, society, the, major, opponent, of, freemasonry, was, the, catholic, church, so, in, countries, with, a, large, catholic, element, such, as, france, italy, spain, and, mexico, much, of, the, ferocity, of, the, political, battles, involve, the, confrontation, between, what, davies, calls, the, reactionary, church, and, enlightened, freemasonry, even, in, france, masons, did, not, act, as, a, group, american, historians, while, noting, that, benjamin, franklin, and, george, washington, were, indeed, active, masons, have, downplayed, the, importance, of, freemasonry, in, causing, the, american, revolution, because, the, masonic, order, was, non, political, and, included, both, patriots, and, their, enemy, the, loyalists, the, art, produced, during, the, enlightenment, focused, on, a, search, for, morality, that, was, absent, from, the, art, in, previous, eras, at, the, same, time, the, classical, art, of, greece, and, rome, became, interesting, to, people, again, since, archaeological, teams, discovered, pompeii, and, herculaneum, people, took, inspiration, from, it, and, revived, classical, art, into, neo, classical, art, this, can, especially, be, seen, in, early, american, art, and, architecture, which, featured, arches, goddesses, and, other, classical, architectural, designs, for, up, to, descartes, a, particular, sub, iectum, lies, at, the, foundation, of, its, own, fixed, qualities, and, changing, circumstances, the, superiority, of, a, sub, iectum, arises, out, of, the, claim, of, man, to, a, self, supported, unshakeable, foundation, of, truth, in, the, sense, of, certainty, why, and, how, does, this, claim, acquire, its, decisive, authority, the, claim, originates, in, that, emancipation, of, man, in, which, he, frees, himself, from, obligation, to, christian, revelational, truth, and, church, doctrine, to, a, legislating, for, himself, that, takes, its, stand, upon, itself
