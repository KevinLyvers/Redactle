ports, on, the, mediterranean, and, black, sea, coasts, in, the, east, the, sultanate, reached, lake, van, trade, through, anatolia, from, iran, and, central, asia, was, developed, by, a, system, of,

later, he, established, a, principality, that, while, initially, a, byzantine, vassal, state, became, increasingly, independent, after, six, to, ten, years, nevertheless, it, seems, that, suleiman, was, tasked, by, byzantine, emperor, alexios, i, komnenos, in, 1085, to, reconquer, antioch, and, the, former, travelled, there, on, a, secret, route, presumably, guided, by, the, byzantines,

komnenos, secretly, hindered, the, crusaders, progress, particularly, in, anatolia, where, he, is, alleged, to, have, deliberately, ordered, turks, to, attack, them, however, this, alleged, sabotage, of, the, crusade, by, the, byzantines, was, likely, fabricated, by, odo, who, saw, the, empire, as, an, obstacle, and, moreover, emperor, manuel, had, no, political, reason, to, do, so, louis, and, conrad, and, the, remnants, of, their, armies, reached, jerusalem, and, participated, in, 1148, in, an, ill, advised, attack, on, damascus, which, ended, in, their, retreat, in, the, end, the, crusade, in, the, east, was, a, failure, for, the, crusaders, and, a, victory, for, the, muslims, it, would, ultimately, have, a, key, influence, on, the, fall, of, jerusalem, and, give, rise, to,

quelled, the, revolt, the, crimean, foothold, was, lost, and, the, state, and, the, sultanate, s, army, had, weakened, it, is, in, these, conditions, that, he, had, to, face, a, far, more, dangerous, threat, that, of, the, expanding, mongols, the, forces, of, the, mongol, empire, took, erzurum, in, 1242, and, in, 1243, the, sultan, was, crushed, by, baiju, in, the, battle, of, k, se, da, a, mountain, between, the, cities, of, sivas, and, erzincan, resulting, in, the, seljuk, turks, being, forced, to, swear, allegiance, to, the, mongols, and, became, their, vassals, the, sultan, himself, had, fled, to, antalya, after, the, battle, where, he, died, in, 1246, his, death, started, a, period, of, tripartite, and, then, dual, rule, that, lasted, until, 1260, the, seljuk, realm, was, divided, among, kaykhusraw, s, three, sons, the, eldest, kaykaus, ii, 1246, 1260, assumed, the, rule, in, the, area, west, of, the, river, k, z, l, rmak, his, younger, brothers, kilij, arslan, iv,

state, had, started, to, split, into, small, emirates, beyliks, that, increasingly, distanced, themselves, from, both, mongol, and, seljuk, control, in, 1277, responding, to, a, call, from, anatolia, the, mamluk, sultan, baibars, raided, anatolia, and, defeated, the, mongols, at, the, battle, of, elbistan, temporarily, replacing, them, as, the, administrator, of, the, seljuk, realm, but, since, the, native, forces, who, had, called, him, to, anatolia, did, not, manifest, themselves, for, the, defense, of, the, land, he, had, to, return, to, his, home, base, in, egypt, and, the, mongol, administration, was, re, assumed, officially, and, severely, also, the, armenian, kingdom, of, cilicia, captured, the, mediterranean, coast, from, selinos, to, seleucia, as, well, as, the, cities, of, marash, and, behisni, from, the, seljuk, in, the, 1240s, near, the, end, of, his, reign, kaykhusraw, iii, could, claim, direct, sovereignty, only, over, lands, around, konya, some, of, the, beyliks, including, the, early, ottoman, state, and, seljuk, governors, of, anatolia, continued, to, recognize, albeit, nominally, the, supremacy, of, the, sultan, in, konya, delivering, the, khutbah, in, the, name, of, the, sultans, in, konya, in, recognition, of, their, sovereignty, and, the, sultans, continued, to, call, themselves, fahreddin, the, pride, of, islam, when, kaykhusraw, iii, was, executed, in, 1284, the, seljuk, dynasty, suffered, another, blow, from, internal, struggles, which, lasted, until, 1303, when, the, son, of, kaykaus, ii, mesud, ii, established, himself, as, sultan, in, kayseri, he, was, murdered, in, 1308, and, his, son, mesud, iii, soon, afterwards, a, distant, relative, to, the, seljuk, dynasty, momentarily, installed, himself, as, emir, of, konya, but, he, was, defeated, and, his, lands, conquered, by, the, karamanids, in, 1328, the, sultanate, s, monetary, sphere, of, influence, lasted, slightly, longer, and, coins, of, seljuk, mint, generally, considered, to, be, of, reliable, value, continued, to, be, used, throughout, the, 14th, century, once, again, including, by, the, ottomans, the, seljuk, dynasty, of, rum, as, successors, to, the, great, seljuks, based, its, political, religious, and, cultural, heritage, on, the, turco, persian, tradition, and, greco, roman, world, even, to, the, point, of, naming, their, sons, with, new, persian, names, the, seljuks, of, rum, had, inherited, the, administrative, method, of, persian, statecraft, from, the, seljuk, empire, which, they, would, later, pass, on, to, the, ottomans, as, an, expression, of, turco, persian, culture, rum, seljuks, patronized, persian, art, architecture, and, literature, unlike, the, seljuk, empire, the, seljuk, sultans, of, rum, had, persian, names, such, as, kay, khosrow, kay, kawad, qobad, and, kay, k, vus, the, bureaucrats, and, religious, elite, of, their, realm, were, generally, persian, in, the, 13th, century, most, muslim, inhabitants, in, major, anatolian, urban, hubs, reportedly, spoke, persian, as, their, main, language, it, was, in, this, century, that, the, proneness, of, imitating, iran, in, terms, of, administration, religion, and, culture, reached, its, zenith, encouraged, by, the, major, influx, of, persian, refugees, fleeing, mongol, invasions, who, brought, persian, culture, with, them, and, were, instrumental, in, creating, a, second, iran, in, anatolia, iranian, cultural, political, and, literary, traditions, deeply, influenced, anatolia, in, the, early, 13th, century, despite, their, turkic, origins, the, seljuks, used, persian, for, administrative, purposes, even, their, histories, which, replaced, arabic, were, in, persian, their, usage, of, turkish, was, hardly, promoted, at, all, even, sultan, kilij, arslan, ii, as, a, child, spoke, to, courtiers, in, persian, khanbaghi, states, the, anatolian, seljuks, were, even, more, persianized, than, the, seljuks, that, ruled, the, iranian, plateau, the, rahat, al, sudur, the, history, of, the, great, seljuk, empire, and, its, breakup, written, in, persian, by, muhammad, bin, ali, rawandi, was, dedicated, to, sultan, kaykhusraw, i, even, the, t, rikh, i, l, i, saldj, q, an, anonymous, history, of, the, sultanate, of, rum, was, written, in, persian, the, sultans, of, rum, were, largely, not, educated, in, arabic, this, clearly, limited, the, arab, influence, or, at, least, the, direct, influence, to, a, relatively, small, degree, in, contrast, persian, literature, and, iranian, influence, expanded, because, most, sultans, and, even, a, significant, portion, of, the, townspeople, knew, the, language, one, of, its, most, famous, persian, writers, rumi, took, his, name, from, the, name, of, the, state, moreover, byzantine, influence, in, the, sultanate, was, also, significant, since, byzantine, greek, aristocracy, remained, part, of, the, seljuk, nobility, and, the, native, byzantine, r, m, peasants, remained, numerous, in, the, region, based, on, their, genealogy, it, appears, that, the, seljuk, sultans, favored, christian, ladies, just, like, the, early, ottoman, sultans, within, the, seljuk, harem, greek, women, were, the, most, dominant, cultural, turkification, in, anatolia, first, started, during, the, 14th, century, particularly, during, the, gradual, rise, of, the, ottomans, with, a, population, that, included, byzantine, greeks, armenians, kurds, turks, and, persians, the, seljuks, were, very, successful, between, 1220, and, 1250, and, set, the, groundwork, for, later, islamization, of, anatolia, in, their, construction, of, caravanserais, madrasas, and, mosques, the, rum, seljuks, translated, the, iranian, seljuk, architecture, of, bricks, and, plaster, into, the, use, of, stone, among, these, the, caravanserais, or, hans, used, as, stops, trading, posts, and, defense, for, caravans, and, of, which, about, a, hundred, structures, were, built, during, the, anatolian, seljuk, period, are, particularly, remarkable, along, with, persian, influences, which, had, an, indisputable, effect, seljuk, architecture, was, inspired, by, local, byzantine, architects, for, example, in, the, celestial, mosque, in, sivas, and, by, armenian, architecture, anatolian, architecture, represents, some, of, the, most, distinctive, and, impressive, constructions, in, the, entire, history, of, islamic, architecture, later, this, anatolian, architecture, would, be, inherited, by, the, sultanate, of, india, the, largest, caravanserai, is, the, sultan, han, built, in, 1229, on, the, road, between, the, cities, of, konya, and, aksaray, in, the, township, of, sultanhan, covering, 3, 900, m, 2, 42, 000, sq, ft, two, caravanserais, carry, the, name, sultan, han, the, other, one, being, between, kayseri, and, sivas, furthermore, apart, from, sultanhan, five, other, towns, across, turkey, owe, their, names, to, caravanserais, built, there, these, are, alacahan, in, kangal, dura, an, hekimhan, and, kad, nhan, as, well, as, the, township, of, akhan, within, the, denizli, metropolitan, area, the, caravanserai, of, hekimhan, is, unique, in, having, underneath, the, usual, inscription, in, arabic, with, information, relating, to, the, tower, two, further, inscriptions, in, armenian, and, syriac, since, it, was, constructed, by, the, sultan, kayqubad, i, s, doctor, hekim, who, is, thought, to, have, been, a, christian, convert, to, islam, there, are, other, particular, cases, like, the, settlement, in, kalehisar, contiguous, to, an, ancient, hittite, site, near, alaca, founded, by, the, seljuk, commander, h, sameddin, temurlu, who, had, taken, refuge, in, the, region, after, the, defeat, in, the, battle, of, k, se, da, and, had, founded, a, township, comprising, a, castle, a, madrasa, a, habitation, zone, and, a, caravanserai, which, were, later, abandoned, apparently, around, the, 16th, century, all, but, the, caravanserai, which, remains, undiscovered, was, explored, in, the, 1960s, by, the, art, historian, oktay, aslanapa, and, the, finds, as, well, as, several, documents, attest, to, the, existence, of, a, vivid, settlement, in, the, site, such, as, a, 1463, ottoman, firman, which, instructs, the, headmaster, of, the, madrasa, to, lodge, not, in, the, school, but, in, the, caravanserai, the, seljuk, palaces, as, well, as, their, armies, were, staffed, with, ghilm, n, arabic, singular, ghulam, slave, soldiers, taken, as, children, from, non, muslim, communities, mainly, greeks, from, former, byzantine, territories, the, practice, of, keeping, ghilm, n, may, have, offered, a, model, for, the, later, dev, irme, during, the, time, of, the, ottoman, empire, the, earliest, documented, rum, seljuq, copper, coins, were, made, in, the, first, part, of, the, twelfth, century, in, konya, and, the, eastern, anatolian, emirates, extensive, numismatic, evidence, suggests, that, starting, in, the, middle, of, the, thirteenth, century, and, continuing, until, the, end, of, the, seljuk, dynasty, silver, producing, mints, and, silver, coinage, flourished, particularly, in, central, and, eastern, anatolia, most, of, kilij, arslan, ii, s, coins, were, minted, in, konya, between, 1177, 78, and, 1195, with, a, small, amount, also, occurring, in, sivas, which, the, rum, seljuks, conquered, from, the, danishmendids, sivas, may, have, started, minting, coins, in, 1185, 1186, the, majority, of, k, l, j, arslan, ii, s, coins, are, silver, dirhams, however, there, are, also, a, few, dinars, and, one,

east, may, have, experienced, a, silver, famine, owing, to, little, or, very, little, silver, mintings, from, the, eleventh, and, most, of, the, twelfth, centuries, however, at, the, start, of, the, thirteenth, century, a, silver, flood, occurred, in, rum, seljuq, territory, when, anatolian, silver, mines, were, discovered, the, fineness, of, rum, seljuq, dirhams, is, similar, to, that, of,

arabic, script, which, the, sultans, used, or, for, a, rendering, corresponding, to, the, modern, turkish, phonology, and, orthography, some, sultans, had, two, names, that, they, chose, to, use,
