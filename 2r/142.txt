nanhai, cangwu, yulin, hepu, jiaozhi, jiuzhen, and, rinan, it, was, traditionally, believed, that, the, qin, conquest, of, the, southern, regions, included, the, northern, half, of, vietnam, and, that, this, area, was, also, under, nanyue, control, however, scholars, have, recently, stated, that, the, qin, likely, never, conquered, territory, in, what, is, now, vietnam, and, that, chinese, domination, there, was, first, accomplished, by, the, nanyue, themselves, zhao, tuo, followed, the, commandery, county, system, of, the, qin, dynasty, when, organizing, the, kingdom, of, nanyue, he,

applied, to, them, after, the, chinese, saw, their, slash, and, burn, method, of, hillside, cultivation, because, the, kingdom, of, nanyue, was, established, by, zhao, tuo, a, chinese, general, of, the, qin, dynasty, nanyue, s, political, and, bureaucratic, systems, were, at, first, essentially, just, continuations, of, those, of, the, qin, empire, itself, because, of, zhao, tuo, s, submissions, to, the, han, dynasty, nanyue, also, adopted, many, of, the, changes, enacted, by, the, han, as, well, at, the, same, time, nanyue, enjoyed, complete, autonomy, and, de, facto, sovereignty, for, most, of, its, existence, so, its, rulers, did, enact, several, systems, that, were, entirely, unique, to, nanyue, nanyue, was, a, monarchy, and, its, head, of, state, generally, held, the, title, of, king, chinese, though, its, first, two, rulers, zhao, tuo, and, zhao, mo, were, referred, to, as, emperor, within, nanyue, s, borders, the, kingdom, had, its, own, calendar, era, system, based, like, china, s, on, emperors, reign, periods, succession, in, the, monarchy, was, based, on, hereditary, rule, with, the, king, or, emperor, s, successor, designated, as, crown, prince, the, ruler, s, mother, was, designated, empress, dowager, his, wife, as, empress, or, queen, and, his, concubines, as, madam, chinese, the, formalities, extended, to, the, ruler, s, family, were, on, the, level, of, that, of, the, han, dynasty, emperor, rather, than, that, of, a, feudal, king, although, nanyue, continued, the, commandery, county, system, of, the, qin, dynasty, its, leaders, later, enfeoffed, their, own, feudal, princes, and, lords, a, mark, of, its, sovereignty, in, a, manner, similar, to, that, of, the, western, han, imperial, documents, from, nanyue, record, that, princes, were, enfeoffed, at, cangwu, xixu, as, well, as, local, lords, at, gaochang, and, elsewhere, zhao, guang, a, relative, of, zhao, tuo, was, made, king, of, cangwu, and, his, holdings, were, what, is, now, wuzhou, in, the, guangxi, zhuang, autonomous, region, in, what, is, considered, a, manifestation, of, zhao, tuo, s, respect, for, the, hundred, yue, he, enfeoffed, a, yue, chieftain, as, king, of, xixu, in, order, to, allow, the, yue, of, that, area, to, enjoy, autonomy, under, a, ruler, of, their, own, ethnicity, the, chieftain, s, name, is, unknown, but, he, was, a, descendant, of, yi, xu, song, the, chieftain, killed, while, fighting, the, original, chinese, invasion, under, the, qin, dynasty, nanyue, s, bureaucracy, was, like, the, famed, bureaucracy, of, the, qin, dynasty, divided, into, central, and, regional, governments, the, central, government, comprised, a, prime, minister, who, held, military, and, administrative, authority, inner, scribes, who, served, under, the, prime, minister, overseeing, censors, of, various, rank, and, position, commanders, of, the, imperial, guard, senior, officials, who, carried, out, the, king, s, official, administration, as, well, as, all, military, officers, and, officials, of, the, food, music, transportation, agriculture, and, other, bureaus, nanyue, enacted, several, other, policies, that, reflected, chinese, dominance, such, as, the, household, registration, system, an, early, form, of, census, as, well, as, the, promulgation, of, the, use, of, chinese, characters, among, the, hundred, yue, population, and, the, use, of, chinese, weights, and, measures, nanyue, s, army, was, largely, composed, of, the, several, hundred, thousand, up, to, 500, 000, qin, chinese, troops, that, invaded, during, the, qin, dynasty, and, their, descendants, after, the, kingdom, s, founding, in, 204, bc, some, yue, citizens, also, joined, the, army, nanyue, s, military, officers, were, known, as, general, general, of, the, left, xiao, colonel, wei, captain, etc, essentially, identical, to, the, chinese, system, the, army, had, infantry, naval, troops, and, cavalry, the, kingdom, continued, most, of, the, qin, commanderies, policies, and, practices, dealing, with, the, interactions, between, the, local, yue, and, the, han, immigrants, and, zhao, tuo, proactively, promoted, a, policy, of, assimilating, the, two, cultures, into, each, other, although, the, han, were, certainly, dominant, in, holding, leadership, positions, the, overwhelming, disparity, was, largest, immediately, after, the, qin, conquest, over, time, the, yue, gradually, began, holding, more, positions, of, authority, in, the, government, l, jia, the, last, prime, minister, of, the, kingdom, was, a, yue, citizen, and, over, 70, of, his, kinsmen, served, as, officials, in, various, parts, of, the, government, in, areas, of, particular, complexity, as, they, were, called, yue, chieftains, were, often, enfeoffed, with, great, autonomy, such, as, in, xixu, under, the, impetus, of, zhao, tuo, s, leadership, chinese, immigrants, were, encouraged, to, adopt, the, customs, of, the, yue, marriages, between, the, han, chinese, and, yue, became, increasingly, common, throughout, nanyue, s, existence, and, even, occurred, in, the, zhao, royal, family, many, marriages, between, the, zhao, royal, family, who, were, han, chinese, and, the, l, family, yue, they, likely, adopted, chinese, names, early, in, nanyue, s, history, were, recorded, zhao, jiande, nanyue, s, last, king, was, the, son, of, previous, king, zhao, yingqi, and, his, yue, wife, despite, the, dominating, influence, of, the, chinese, newcomers, on, the, hundred, yue, the, amount, of, assimilation, gradually, increased, over, time, other, than, old, chinese, which, was, used, by, han, settlers, and, government, officials, native, nanyue, people, likely, spoke, ancient, yue, a, now, extinct, language, some, scholars, suggest, that, they, spoke, a, language, related, to, the, modern, zhuang, language, some, suggest, that, the, descendants, spoke, austroasiatic, languages, instead, it, is, plausible, to, say, that, the, yue, spoke, more, than, one, language, old, chinese, in, the, region, was, likely, much, influenced, by, yue, speech, and, vice, versa, and, many, loanwords, in, chinese, have, been, identified, by, modern, scholars, beginning, with, its, first, allegiance, to, the, han, dynasty, in, 196, bc, nanyue, alternately, went, through, two, periods, of, allegiance, to, and, then, opposition, with, the, han, dynasty, that, continued, until, nanyue, s, destruction, at, the, hands, of, the, han, dynasty, in, early, 111, bc, the, first, period, of, nanyue, s, subordination, to, the, han, dynasty, began, in, 196, bc, when, zhao, tuo, met, l, jia, an, emissary, from, emperor, gaozu, of, han, and, received, from, him, a, han, imperial, seal, enthroning, zhao, tuo, as, king, of, nanyue, this, period, lasted, thirteen, years, until, 183, bc, during, which, time, significant, trade, took, place, nanyue, paid, tribute, in, rarities, from, the, south, and, the, han, court, bestowed, gifts, of, iron, tools, horses, and, cattle, upon, nanyue, at, the, same, time, the, countries, borders, were, always, heavily, guarded, nanyue, s, first, period, of, antagonism, with, the, han, dynasty, lasted, from, 183, bc, to, 179, bc, when, trade, was, suspended, and, zhao, tuo, severed, relations, with, the, han, during, this, period, zhao, tuo, openly, referred, to, himself, as, emperor, and, launched, an, attack, against, the, changsha, kingdom, a, feudal, state, of, the, han, dynasty, and, han, troops, were, sent, to, engage, nanyue, nanyue, s, armies, successfully, halted, the, southern, progress, of, the, advance, winning, the, respect, and, then, allegiance, of, the, neighboring, kingdoms, of, minyue, and, yelang, nanyue, s, second, period, of, submission, to, the, han, dynasty, lasted, from, 179, bc, to, 112, bc, this, period, began, with, zhao, tuo, abandoning, his, title, of, emperor, and, declaring, allegiance, to, the, han, empire, but, the, submission, is, mostly, superficial, as, zhao, tuo, was, referred, to, as, emperor, throughout, nanyue, and, the, kingdom, retained, its, autonomy, zhao, tuo, s, four, successors, did, not, display, the, strength, he, had, and, nanyue, dependence, on, han, china, slowly, grew, characterized, by, second, king, zhao, mo, calling, upon, emperor, wu, of, han, to, defend, nanyue, from, minyue, nanyue, s, final, period, of, antagonism, with, han, china, was, the, war, that, proved, nanyue, s, destruction, as, a, kingdom, at, the, time, of, prime, minister, l, jia, s, rebellion, han, china, was, enjoying, a, period, of, growth, economic, prosperity, and, military, success, having, consistently, defeated, the, xiongnu, tribes, along, china, s, northern, and, northwestern, borders, the, weakened, state, of, nanyue, and, the, strength, of, china, at, the, time, allowed, emperor, wu, to, unleash, a, devastating, attack, on, nanyue, as, described, above, the, changsha, kingdom, was, at, the, time, a, feudal, kingdom, that, was, part, of, han, dynasty, its, territory, comprised, most, of, modern, hunan, province, and, part, of, jiangxi, province, when, emperor, gaozu, of, han, enfeoffed, wu, rui, as, the, first, king, of, changsha, he, also, gave, him, the, power, to, govern, nanhai, xiang, and, guiling, commanderies, which, caused, strife, between, changsha, and, nanyue, from, the, start, the, han, china, nanyue, border, was, essentially, that, of, changsha, and, therefore, was, constantly, fortified, on, both, sides, in, terms, of, policies, because, the, kingdom, of, changsha, had, no, sovereignty, whatsoever, any, policy, of, the, han, court, toward, nanyue, was, by, default, also, changsha, s, policy, minyue, was, located, northeast, of, nanyue, along, china, s, southeast, coast, and, comprised, much, of, modern, fujian, province, the, minyue, were, defeated, by, the, armies, of, the, qin, dynasty, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, and, the, area, was, organized, under, qin, control, as, the, minzhong, commandery, and, minyue, ruler, wuzhu, was, deposed, because, of, wuzhu, s, support, for, liu, bang, after, the, collapse, of, the, qin, dynasty, and, the, founding, of, the, han, he, was, reinstated, by, the, han, court, as, king, of, minyue, in, 202, bc, the, relations, between, nanyue, and, minyue, can, be, classified, into, three, stages, the, first, from, 196, bc, to, 183, bc, was, during, zhao, tuo, s, first, submission, to, the, han, dynasty, and, the, two, kingdoms, were, on, relatively, equal, footing, the, second, stage, was, from, 183, bc, to, 135, bc, when, minyue, submitted, to, nanyue, after, seeing, it, defeat, the, han, dynasty, s, first, attack, on, nanyue, the, third, stage, began, in, 135, bc, when, king, wang, ying, attacked, a, weakened, nanyue, forcing, zhao, mo, to, seek, aid, from, han, china, minyue, once, again, submitted, to, the, han, dynasty, making, itself, and, nanyue, equals, once, more, the, southwestern, yi, people, lived, west, of, nanyue, and, shared, borders, with, nanyue, in, yelang, wulian, juding, and, other, regions, yelang, was, the, largest, state, of, the, yi, people, comprising, most, of, modern, guizhou, and, yunnan, provinces, as, well, as, the, southern, part, of, sichuan, province, some, believe, the, ancient, yi, to, have, been, related, to, the, hundred, yue, with, this, explaining, the, close, relationship, between, yelang, and, nanyue, after, nanyue, first, repelled, the, han, nearly, all, of, the, yi, tribes, declared, allegiance, to, nanyue, and, most, of, them, retained, that, allegiance, until, nanyue, s, demise, in, 111, bc, during, emperor, wu, of, han, s, final, attack, on, nanyue, most, of, the, yi, tribes, refused, to, assist, in, the, invasion, one, chieftain, called, qie, lan, went, so, far, as, to, openly, oppose, the, move, later, killing, the, emissary, sent, by, the, han, to, his, territory, as, well, as, the, provincial, governor, installed, in, the, qianwei, commandery, the, nanyue, kingdom, palace, ruins, located, in, the, city, of, guangzhou, covers, 15, 000, square, metres, excavated, in, 1995, it, contains, the, remains, of, the, ancient, nanyue, palace, in, 1996, it, was, listed, as, protected,

disturbed, by, tomb, robbers, prior, to, this, discovery, leaving, most, of, the, artifacts, intact, in, 1988, the, museum, of, the, mausoleum, of, the, nanyue, king, was, constructed, on, this, site, to, display, more, than, 1, 000, excavated, artefacts, including, 500, pieces, of, chinese, bronzes, 240, pieces, of, chinese, jade, and, 246, pieces, of, metal, all, of, which, provide, invaluable, information, about, nanyue, in, 1996, the, chinese, government, listed, this, site, as, a, protected, national, heritage, site, a, bronze, seal, inscribed, t, ph, h, u, n, seal, for, captain, of, tu, pho, county, was, uncovered, at, thanh, hoa, in, northern, vietnam, during, the, 1930s, owing, to, the, similarity, to, seals, found, at, the, tomb, of, the, second, king, of, nam, viet, this, bronze, seal, is, recognized, as, an, official, seal, of, the, nam, viet, kingdom, there, were, artifacts, that, were, found, in, which, belonged, to, the, dong, son, culture, of, northern, vietnam, the,

pronunciation, of, the, surname, chinese, pinyin, zh, o, while, traditional, vietnamese, historiography, considered, the, tri, u, dynasty, to, be, an, orthodox, regime, modern, vietnamese, scholars, generally, regard, it, as, a, foreign, regime, that, ruled, vietnam, the, oldest, text, compiled, by, a, vietnamese, court, the, 13th, century, i, vi, t, s, k, considered, nanyue, to, be, the, official, starting, point, of, their, history, according, to, the, i, vi, t, s, k, zhao, tuo, established, the, foundation, of, i, vi, t, however, later, historians, in, the, 18th, century, started, questioning, this, view, ng, th, s, argued, that, zhao, tuo, was, a, foreign, invader, and, nanyue, a, foreign, dynasty, that, should, not, be, included, in, vietnamese, history, this, view, became, the, mainstream, among, vietnamese, historians, in, north, vietnam, and, later, became, the, state, orthodoxy, after, reunification, nanyue, was, removed, from, the, national, history, while, zhao, tuo, was, recast, as, a, foreign, invader, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, name, vietnam, was, derived, from, a, combination, of, qu, ng, nam, qu, c, the, domain, of, the, nguyen, lords, from, whom, the, nguy, n, dynasty, descended, and, i, vi, t, which, the, first, emperor, of, the, nguy, n, dynasty, gia, long, conquered, qing, emperor, jiaqing, refused, gia, long, s, request, to, change,

that, ethnic, vietnamese, are, descended, from, the, ancient, yu, of, northern, vietnam, and, western, guangdong, however, the, austroasiatic, predecessor, of, modern, vietnamese, language, has, been, proven, to, originate, in, modern, day, bolikhamsai, province, and, khammouane, province, in, laos, as, well, as, parts, of, ngh, an, province, and, qu, ng, b, nh, province, in, vietnam, rather, than, in, the, region, north, of, the, red, river, delta, chamberlain, demonstrates, with, textual, evidence, that, many, rebel, groups, during, the, tang, dynasty, originated, from, the, c, river, and, subsequently, pushed, northward, to, the, red, river, linking, this, to, the, linguistic, shift, chamberlain, demonstrates, based, on, the, concentration, of, linguistic, diversity, of, the, vietic, the, lack, of, any, trace, of, austroasiatic, in, relevant, ancient, records, or, in, the, neighbouring, tai, languages, as, well, as, the, short, time, depth, of, proto, vietic, that, here, is, no, evidence, of, vietic, proto, vi, t, m, ng, or, other, austroasiatic, speakers, living, in, and, around, jiaozhi, in, the, lower, red, river, basin, prior, to, the, 10th, or, 11th, centuries, however, john, phan, 2010, citing, maspero, 1912, wang, 1948, miyake, 2003, points, out, the, existence, of, an, early, sino, vietnamese, layer, of, loanwords, traceable, back, to, later, han, chinese, 25, ad, 220, ad, which, he, claims, was, spoken, in, the, 2nd, century, bce, ferlus, 2009, also, demonstrates, that, northern, vietic, vi, t, m, ng, and, central, vietic, cuoi, toum, invented, from, original, verbs, rather, than, borrowed, foreign, words, lexical, items, corresponding, to, innovations, like, trident, oar, pan, to, cook, sticky, rice, pestle, characteristic, of, the, dong, son, culture,
