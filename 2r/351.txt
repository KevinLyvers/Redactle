the, treaty, of, tordesillas, signed, in, tordesillas, spain, on, 7, june, 1494, and, ratified, in, set, bal, portugal, divided, the, newly, discovered, lands, outside, europe, between, the, kingdom, of, portugal, and, the, crown, of, castile, along, a, meridian, 370, leagues, west, of, the, cape, verde, islands, off, the, west, coast, of, africa, that, line, of, demarcation, was, about, halfway, between, cape, verde, already, portuguese, and, the, islands, visited, by, christopher, columbus, on, his, first, voyage, claimed, for, castile, and, le, n, named, in, the, treaty, as, cipangu, and, antillia, cuba, and, hispaniola, the, lands, to, the, east, would, belong, to, portugal, and, the, lands, to, the, west, to, castile, modifying, an, earlier, bull, by, pope, alexander, vi, the, treaty, was, signed, by, spain, on, 2, july, 1494, and, by, portugal, on, 5, september, 1494, the, other, side, of, the, world, was, divided, a, few, decades, later, by, the, treaty, of, zaragoza, signed, on, 22, april, 1529, which, specified, the, antimeridian, to, the, line, of, demarcation, specified, in, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, portugal, and, spain, largely, respected, the, treaties, while, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, did, not, acknowledge, them, the, treaty, was, included, by, unesco, in, 2007, in, its, memory, of, the, world, programme, originals, of, both, treaties, are, kept, at, the, general, archive, of, the, indies, in, spain, and, at, the, torre, do, tombo, national, archive, in, portugal, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, was, intended, to, solve, the, dispute, that, arose, following, the, return, of, christopher, columbus, and, his, crew, who, had, sailed, under, the, crown, of, castile, on, his, way, back, to, spain, he, first, stopped, at, lisbon, where, he, requested, another, meeting, with, king, john, ii, to, prove, to, him, that, there, were, more, islands, to, the, southwest, of, the, canary, islands, after, learning, of, the, castilian, sponsored, voyage, the, portuguese, king, sent, a, threatening, letter, to, the, catholic, monarchs, king, ferdinand, and, queen, isabella, stating, that, by, the, treaty, of, alc, ovas, signed, in, 1479, and, by, the, 1481, papal, bull, aeterni, regis, that, granted, all, lands, south, of, the, canary, islands, to, portugal, all, of, the, lands, discovered, by, columbus, belonged, in, fact, to, portugal, the, portuguese, king, also, stated, that, he, was, already, making, arrangements, for, a, fleet, an, armada, led, by, francisco, de, almeida, to, depart, shortly, and, take, possession, of, the, new, lands, the, spanish, rulers, replied, that, spain, owned, the, islands, discovered, by, columbus, and, warned, king, jo, o, not, permit, anyone, from, portugal, to, go, there, finally, the, rulers, invited, portugal, to, send, ambassadors, to, begin, diplomatic, negotiations, aimed, at, settling, the, rights, of, each, nation, in, the, atlantic, on, 4, may, 1493, pope, alexander, vi, rodrigo, borgia, an, aragonese, from, valencia, by, birth, decreed, in, the, bull, inter, caetera, that, all, lands, west, of, a, pole, to, pole, line, 100, leagues, west, of, any, of, the, islands, of, the, azores, or, the, cape, verde, islands, should, belong, to, castile, although, territory, under, christian, rule, as, of, christmas, 1492, would, remain, untouched, the, bull, did, not, mention, portugal, or, its, lands, so, portugal, could, not, claim, newly, discovered, lands, even, if, they, were, east, of, the, line, another, bull, dudum, siquidem, entitled, extension, of, the, apostolic, grant, and, donation, of, the, indies, and, dated, 25, september, 1493, gave, all, mainlands, and, islands, at, one, time, or, even, still, belonging, to, india, to, spain, even, if, east, of, the, line, the, portuguese, king, john, ii, was, not, pleased, with, that, arrangement, feeling, that, it, gave, him, far, too, little, land, it, prevented, him, from, possessing, india, his, near, term, goal, by, 1493, portuguese, explorers, had, reached, the, southern, tip, of, africa, the, cape, of, good, hope, the, portuguese, were, unlikely, to, go, to, war, over, the, islands, encountered, by, columbus, but, the, explicit, mention, of, india, was, a, major, issue, as, the, pope, had, not, made, changes, the, portuguese, king, opened, direct, negotiations, with, the, catholic, monarchs, to, move, the, line, to, the, west, and, allow, him, to, claim, newly, discovered, lands, east, of, the, line, in, the, bargain, john, accepted, inter, caetera, as, the, starting, point, of, discussion, with, ferdinand, and, isabella, but, had, the, boundary, line, moved, 270, leagues, west, protecting, the, portuguese, route, down, the, coast, of, africa, and, giving, the, portuguese, rights, to, lands, that, now, constitute, the, eastern, quarter, of, brazil, as, one, scholar, assessed, the, results, both, sides, must, have, known, that, so, vague, a, boundary, could, not, be, accurately, fixed, and, each, thought, that, the, other, was, deceived, concluding, that, it, was, a, diplomatic, triumph, for, portugal, confirming, to, the, portuguese, not, only, the, true, route, to, india, but, most, of, the, south, atlantic, the, treaty, was, negotiated, without, consulting, pope, alexander, vi, and, effectively, countered, his, bulls, however, it, was, subsequently, sanctioned, by, his, successor, pope, julius, ii, by, means, of, the, bull, ea, quae, pro, bono, pacis, of, 24, january, 1506, and, therefore, some, sources, call, the, resulting, line, the, papal, line, of, demarcation, very, little, of, the, newly, divided, area, had, actually, been, seen, by, europeans, as, it, was, only, divided, via, the, treaty, castile, gained, lands, including, most, of, the, americas, which, in, 1494, had, little, proven, wealth, the, easternmost, part, of, current, brazil, was, granted, to, portugal, when, in, 1500, pedro, lvares, cabral, landed, there, while, he, was, en, route, to, india, some, historians, contend, that, the, portuguese, already, knew, of, the, south, american, bulge, that, makes, up, most, of, brazil, before, this, time, so, his, landing, in, brazil, was, not, an, accident, one, scholar, points, to, cabral, s, landing, on, the, brazilian, coast, 12, degrees, farther, south, than, the, expected, cape, s, o, roque, such, that, the, likelihood, of, making, such, a, landfall, as, a, result, of, freak, weather, or, a, navigational, error, was, remote, and, it, is, highly, probable, that, cabral, had, been, instructed, to, investigate, a, coast, whose, existence, was, not, merely, suspected, but, already, known, the, line, was, not, strictly, enforced, the, spanish, did, not, resist, the, portuguese, expansion, of, brazil, across, the, meridian, however, spain, attempted, to, stop, the, portuguese, advance, in, asia, by, claiming, the, meridian, line, ran, around, the, world, dividing, the, whole, world, in, half, rather, than, just, the, atlantic, portugal, pushed, back, seeking, another, papal, pronouncement, that, limited, the, line, of, demarcation, to, the, atlantic, this, was, given, by, pope, leo, x, who, was, friendly, toward, portugal, and, its, discoveries, in, 1514, in, the, bull, praecelsae, devotionis, the, divided, possessions, sanctioned, by, the, treaty, continued, even, when, spain, and, portugal, were, united, under, a, single, king, between, 1580, and, 1640, until, the, treaty, was, superseded, by, the, 1750, treaty, of, madrid, emerging, protestant, maritime, powers, particularly, england, and, the, netherlands, and, other, third, parties, such, as, catholic, france, did, not, recognize, the, division, of, the, world, between, only, two, catholic, nations, brokered, by, the, pope, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, only, specified, the, line, of, demarcation, in, leagues, from, the, cape, verde, islands, it, did, not, specify, the, length, of, the, league, its, equivalent, in, equatorial, degrees, or, which, of, the, cape, verde, islands, was, intended, instead, the, treaty, provided, that, these, matters, were, to, be, settled, by, a, joint, voyage, this, voyage, never, occurred, and, instead, there, were, only, a, series, of, nonbinding, expert, opinions, produced, over, the, next, several, decades, their, computations, were, further, complicated, by, remaining, uncertainty, about, the, exact, equatorial, circumference, of, the, earth, as, such, each, proposed, line, can, be, variously, computed, using, geographical, leagues, defined, in, terms, of, a, degree, using, a, ratio, which, applies, regardless, of, the, size, of, the, earth, or, using, a, specifically, measured, league, applied, to, the, actual, equatorial, circumference, of, the, earth, with, allowances, necessary, for, the, imperfect, portuguese, and, spanish, knowledge, of, its, true, dimensions, initially, the, line, of, demarcation, did, not, encircle, the, earth, instead, spain, and, portugal, could, conquer, any, new, lands, they, were, the, first, to, discover, spain, to, the, west, and, portugal, to, the, east, even, if, they, passed, each, other, on, the, other, side, of, the, globe, but, portugal, s, discovery, of, the, highly, valued, moluccas, in, 1512, caused, spain, to, argue, in, 1518, that, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, divided, the, earth, into, two, equal, hemispheres, after, the, surviving, ships, of, magellan, s, fleet, visited, the, moluccas, in, 1521, spain, claimed, that, those, islands, were, within, its, western, hemisphere, the, treaty, of, vitoria, negotiated, between, spain, and, portugal, on, 19, february, 1524, called, for, the, junta, of, badajoz, to, meet, in, an, attempt, to, reach, an, agreement, on, the, anti, meridian, which, ultimately, failed, it, was, finally, agreed, in, the, treaty, of, zaragoza, or, saragossa, signed, on, 22, april, 1529, that, spain, would, relinquish, its, claims, to, the, moluccas, upon, the, payment, of, 350, 000, ducats, of, gold, by, portugal, to, spain, to, prevent, spain, from, encroaching, upon, portugal, s, moluccas, the, anti, meridian, was, to, be, 297, 1, 2, leagues, or, 17, to, the, east, of, the, moluccas, passing, through, the, islands, of, las, velas, and, santo, thome, this, distance, is, slightly, smaller, than, the, 300, leagues, determined, by, magellan, as, the, westward, distance, from, los, ladrones, to, the, philippine, island, of, samar, which, is, just, west, of, due, north, of, the, moluccas, the, moluccas, are, a, group, of, islands, west, of, new, guinea, however, unlike, the, large, modern, indonesian, archipelago, of, the, maluku, islands, to, 16th, century, europeans, the, moluccas, were, a, small, chain, of, islands, the, only, place, on, earth, where, cloves, grew, just, west, of, the, large, north, malukan, island, of, halmahera, called, gilolo, at, the, time, cloves, were, so, prized, by, europeans, for, the, medicinal, uses, that, they, were, worth, their, weight, in, gold, 16th, and, 17th, century, maps, and, descriptions, indicate, that, the, main, islands, were, ternate, tidore, moti, makian, and, bacan, although, the, last, was, often, ignored, even, though, it, was, by, far, the, largest, island, the, principal, island, was, ternate, at, the, chain, s, northern, end, 0, 47, n, only, 11, kilometres, 7, mi, in, diameter, on, whose, southwest, coast, the, portuguese, built, a, stone, fort, forte, de, s, o, jo, o, baptista, de, ternate, during, 1522, 23, which, could, only, be, repaired, not, modified, according, to, the, treaty, of, zaragoza, this, north, south, chain, occupies, two, degrees, of, latitude, bisected, by, the, equator, at, about, 127, 24, e, with, ternate, tidore, moti, and, makian, north, of, the, equator, and, bacan, south, of, it, although, the, treaty, s, santo, thome, island, has, not, been, identified, its, islas, de, las, velas, islands, of, the, sails, appear, in, a, 1585, spanish, history, of, china, on, the, 1594, world, map, of, petrus, plancius, on, an, anonymous, map, of, the, moluccas, in, the, 1598, london, edition, of, linschoten, and, on, the, 1607, world, map, of, petro, k, rio, identified, as, a, north, south, chain, of, islands, in, the, northwest, pacific, which, were, also, called, the, islas, de, los, ladrones, islands, of, the, thieves, during, that, period, their, name, was, changed, by, spain, in, 1667, to, islas, de, las, marianas, mariana, islands, which, include, guam, at, their, southern, end, guam, s, longitude, of, 144, 45, e, is, east, of, the, moluccas, longitude, of, 127, 24, e, by, 17, 21, which, is, remarkably, close, by, 16th, century, standards, to, the, treaty, s, 17, east, this, longitude, passes, through, the, eastern, end, of, the, main, north, japanese, island, of, hokkaid, and, through, the, eastern, end, of, new, guinea, which, is, where, fr, d, ric, durand, placed, the, demarcation, line, moriarty, and, keistman, placed, the, demarcation, line, at, 147, e, by, measuring, 16, 4, east, from, the, western, end, of, new, guinea, or, 17, east, of, 130, e, despite, the, treaty, s, clear, statement, that, the, demarcation, line, passes, 17, east, of, the, moluccas, some, sources, place, the, line, just, east, of, the, moluccas, the, treaty, of, zaragoza, did, not, modify, or, clarify, the, line, of, demarcation, provided, by, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, nor, did, it, validate, spain, s, claim, to, equal, hemispheres, 180, each, so, the, two, lines, divided, the, earth, into, unequal, hemispheres, portugal, s, portion, was, roughly, 191, whereas, spain, s, portion, was, roughly, 169, both, portions, have, a, large, uncertainty, of, 4, because, of, the, wide, variation, in, the, opinions, regarding, the, location, of, the, tordesillas, line, portugal, gained, control, of, all, lands, and, seas, west, of, the, zaragoza, line, including, all, of, asia, and, its, neighboring, islands, so, far, discovered, leaving, spain, most, of, the, pacific, ocean, although, the, philippines, were, not, named, in, the, treaty, spain, implicitly, relinquished, any, claim, to, them, because, they, were, well, west, of, the, line, nevertheless, by, 1542, charles, v, decided, to, colonize, the, philippines, judging, that, portugal, would, not, protest, because, the, archipelago, had, no, spices, although, a, number, of, expeditions, sent, from, new, spain, arrived, in, the, philippines, they, were, unable, to, establish, a, settlement, because, the, return, route, across, the, pacific, was, unknown, king, philip, ii, succeeded, in, 1565, when, he, sent, miguel, l, pez, de, legazpi, and, andr, s, de, urdaneta, establishing, the, initial, spanish, trading, post, at, cebu, and, later, founding, manila, in, 1571, besides, brazil, and, the, moluccas, portugal, eventually, controlled, angola, mozambique, portuguese, guinea, and, s, o, tom, and, pr, ncipe, among, other, territories, and, bases, in, africa, several, bases, or, territories, such, as, muscat, ormus, and, bahrain, in, the, persian, gulf, goa, bombay, and, daman, and, diu, among, other, coastal, cities, in, india, ceylon, and, malacca, bases, in, present, day, indonesia, as, makassar, solor, ambon, and, portuguese, timor, the, entrep, t, base, of, macau, and, the, entrep, t, enclave, of, dejima, nagasaki, in, the, far, east, spain, on, the, other, hand, would, control, vast, western, regions, in, the, americas, in, areas, ranging, from, the, present, day, united, states, to, present, day, argentina, an, empire, that, would, extend, to, the, philippines, and, bases, in, ternate, and, formosa, 17th, century, the, attitude, towards, the, treaty, that, other, governments, had, was, expressed, by, france, s, francis, i, who, declared, the, sun, shines, for, me, as, it, does, for, others, i, would, very, much, like, to, see, the, clause, of, adam, s, will, by, which, i, should, be, denied, my, share, of, the, world, on, january, 13, 1750, king, john, v, of, portugal, and, ferdinand, vi, of, spain, signed, the, treaty, of, madrid, in, which, both, parties, sought, to, establish, the, borders, between, brazil, and, spanish, america, admitting, that, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, as, it, had, been, envisioned, in, 1494, had, been, superseded, and, was, considered, void, spanish, sovereignty, was, acknowledged, over, the, philippines, while, portugal, would, get, the, territory, of, the, amazon, river, basin, portugal, would, relinquish, the, colony, of, sacramento, on, the, left, bank, of, the, river, plata, in, modern, day, uruguay, while, getting, the, territory, of, the, seven, missions, following, the, guarani, war, the, treaty, was, annulled, by, spain, and, portugal, in, the, treaty, of, el, pardo, 1761, the, border, was, eventually, settled, in, the, first, treaty, of, san, ildefonso, in, 1777, with, spain, acquiring, territories, east, of, the, uruguay, river, and, portugal, acquiring, territories, in, the, amazon, basin, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, was, invoked, by, chile, in, the, 20th, century, to, defend, the, principle, of, an, antarctic, sector, extending, along, a, meridian, to, the, south, pole, as, well, as, the, assertion, that, the, treaty, made, spanish, or, portuguese, all, undiscovered, land, south, to, the, pole
