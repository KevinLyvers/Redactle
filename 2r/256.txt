suppressed, by, a, large, scale, alliance, between, the, imperial, dynasty, and, various, participants, including, local, militias, and, foreign, support, the, dynasty, did, not, overall, change, the, structure, of, the, military, committee, but, only, followed, the, old, principles, of, establishing, territory, it, was, a, direct, cause, of, the, dynasty, s, decline, and, led, to, rampant, secessionism, among, regional, warlords, during, the, latter, half, of, the, dynasty, that, continued, into, the, five, dynasties, and, ten, kingdoms, period, for, decades, after, the, ultimate, demise, of, the, tang, the, fear, of, repeating, tang, s, commandery, secessionism, also, led, the, song, dynasty, that, followed, to, distrust, and, oppress, prominent, military, commanders, even, when, invaded, by, hostile, foreign, states, such, as, liao, western, xia, and, jin, it, also, triggered, the, long, term, decline, of, the, guanzhong, region, which, had, been, a, political, and, economic, heartland, of, china, at, least, since, the, han, dynasty, and, a, shift, of, the, economic, center, of, china, towards, the, jiangnan, region, beginning, in, 742, eurasia, entered, a, 13,

seems, to, have, been, organized, by, merchants, and, persons, identifying, themselves, as, merchants, 143, the, western, expansion, of, the, tang, empire, was, checked, in, 751, by, the, defeat, of, a, large, expeditionary, force, led, by, general, gao, xianzhi, in, the, battle, of, talas, in, the, modern, fergana, valley, with, the, abbasid, victory, attributable, to, the, defection, of, the, karluk, turks, in, the, midst, of, the, battle, however, the, arabs, did, not, proceed, any, further, after, the, battle, and, the, tang, retained, their, central, asian, territories, until, the, an, lushan, rebellion, 39, further, southern, expansion, of, the, tang, was, limited, by, the, ineffective, and, even, disastrous, campaigns, against, the, kingdom, of, nanzhao, however, the, concurrent, tang, campaign, against, the, tibetan, empire, was, proceeding, more, successfully, with, the, campaign, to, capture, the, tibetans, central, asian, territories, appearing, nearly, successful, with, the, assassination, of, the, tibetan, emperor, me, agtsom, in, 755, in, the, midst, of, a, major, rebellion, within, the, tibetan, polity, final, tang, victory, over, the, tibetan, empire, seemed, all, but, assured, however, back, in, the, increasingly, financially, challenged, chinese, heartland, the, sogdian, turkic, general, an, lushan, had, worked, himself, into, a, position, of, trust, with, the, tang, emperor, xuanzong, and, his, consort, yang, guifei, an, lushan, was, a, general, of, uncertain, birth, origins, but, thought, to, have, been, adopted, by, a, sogdian, father, and, g, kt, rk, mother, of, the, ashina, tribe, 145, note, 19, eventually, he, managed, to, become, a, favorite, of, the, reigning, emperor, of, china, his, success, in, this, regard, is, shown, for, example, by, the, luxurious, house, emperor, xuanzong, built, for, him, in, 751, in, the, capital, chang, an, the, house, was, furnished, with, luxuries, such, as, gold, and, silver, objects, and, a, pair, of, ten, foot, long, 3, 0, m, by, six, foot, wide, 1, 8, m, couches, appliqued, with, rare, and, expensive, sandalwood, 137, he, was, appointed, by, emperor, xuanzong, following, the, suggestion, of, xuanzong, s, favorite, concubine, yang, guifei, and, with, the, agreement, of, chancellor, li, linfu, to, be, jiedushi, of, three, garrisons, in, the, north, pinglu, fanyang, and, hedong, in, effect,

circumstances, such, as, popular, discontent, with, an, extravagant, tang, court, the, synchronous, sogdian, involved, abbasid, revolution, against, the, umayyad, dynasty, 146, and, eventually, the, absence, of, strong, troops, guarding, the, palace, coupled, with, a, string, of, natural, disasters, an, lushan, was, very, influential, in, the, tang, court, his, close, relationship, with, emperor, xuanzong, led, to, him, being, adopted, by, the, imperial, concubine, yang, guifei, the, positions, of, power, of, yang, clan, members, the, family, of, the, preceding, sui, dynasty, into, which, the, tang, emperor, had, married, were, important, in, this, situation, especially, complicated, by, the, position, of, yang, guifei, s, relative, yang, guozhong, in, the, tang, governmental, administration, the, an, lushan, rebellion, signaled, a, period, of, disorder, spanning, the, reigns, of, three, tang, dynasty, emperors, beginning, during, the, final, tianbao, era, period, of, the, reign, of, xuanzong, 8, september, 712, to, 12, august, 756, continuing, through, the, reign, of, suzong, 12, august, 756, to, 16, may, 762, and, ending, during, the, reign, of, daizong, 18, may, 762,

from, fanyang, near, modern, beijing, along, the, way, an, lushan, treated, surrendered, local, tang, officials, with, respect, as, a, result, more, and, more, of, them, joined, his, ranks, he, moved, rapidly, along, the, grand, canal, and, captured, the, eastern, capital, city, of, luoyang, on, 18, january, 756, defeating, the, poorly, supplied, general, feng, changqing, there, on, 5, february, an, lushan, declared, himself, emperor, of, the, new, great, yan, dynasty, his, next, steps, would, be, to, capture, the, tang, western, capital, of, chang, an, and, then, to, attempt, to, continue, into, southern, china, to, complete, his, conquest, however, the, battle, of, yongqiu, in, the, spring, of, 756, went, badly, for, an, lushan, although, his, army, under, linghu, chao, was, numerous, it, was, unable, to, make, further, territorial, gains, due, to, the, failure, to, wrest, control, of, yongqiu, modern, qi, county, kaifeng, in, henan, and, later, the, nearby, suiyang, from, the, tang, defenders, led, by, zhang, xun, this, prevented, the, yan, forces, from, conquering, southern, china, before, the, tang, were, able, to, recover, the, yan, army, did, not, take, control, of, suiyang, until, after, the, siege, of, suiyang, january, october, 757, almost, two, years, after, their, initial, capture, of, luoyang, originally, an, lushan, s, forces, were, blocked, from, the, main, imperial, or, western, capital, at, chang, an, modern, xi, an, by, loyal, troops, placed, in, nearly, impregnable, defensive, positions, in, the, intervening, high, mountain, passes, of,

some, lost, faith, in, themselves, concluding, that, a, lack, of, moral, seriousness, in, intellectual, culture, had, been, the, cause, of, the, rebellion, however, a, political, and, cultural, recovery, eventually, did, occur, within, tang, china, several, decades, after, the, rebellion, until, about, 820, 9, 10, the, year, of, the, death, of, emperor, xianzong, of, tang, much, of, the, rebuilding, and, recovery, occurred, in, the, jiangnan, region, in, the, south, which, had, escaped, the, events, of, the, rebellion, relatively, unscathed, and, remained, more, firmly, under, tang, control, however, due, in, part, to, the, jiedushi, system, the, tang, empire, by, 907, devolved, into, what, is, known, as, the, five, dynasties, and, ten, kingdoms, period, the, tang, dynasty, recovered, its, power, decades, after, the, an, lushan, rebellion, and, was, still, able, to, launch, offensive, conquests, and, campaigns, like, its, destruction, of, the, uyghur, khaganate, in,
