for, the, isil, uprising, the, term, near, east, can, be, used, interchangeably, with, middle, east, but, in, a, different, context, especially, in, discussing, ancient, history, it, may, have, a, limited, meaning, namely, the, northern, historically, aramaic, speaking, semitic, people, area, and, adjacent, anatolian, territories, marked, in, the, two, maps, below, geographically, the, middle, east, can, be, thought, of, as, western, asia, with, the, addition, of, egypt, which, is, the, non, maghreb, region, of, northern, africa, and, with, the, exclusion, of, the, caucasus, the, middle, east, was, the, first, to, experience, a, neolithic, revolution, c, the, 10th, millennium, bce, as, well, as, the, first, to, enter, the, bronze, age, c, 3300, 1200, bc, and, iron, age, c, 1200, 500, bc, historically, human, populations, have, tended, to, settle, around, bodies, of, water, which, is, reflected, in, modern, population, density, patterns, irrigation, systems, were, extremely, important, for, the, agricultural, middle, east, for, egypt, that, of, the, lower, nile, river, and, for, mesopotamia, that, of, the, tigris, and, euphrates, rivers, levantine, agriculture, depended, on, precipitation, rather, than, on, the, river, based, irrigation, of, egypt, and, mesopotamia, resulting, in, preference, for, different, crops, since, travel, was, faster, and, easier, by, sea, civilizations, along, the, mediterranean, such, as, phoenicia, and, later, greece, participated, in, intense, trade, similarly, ancient, yemen, being, much, more, conducive, to, agriculture, than, the, rest, of, the, arabian, peninsula, sea, traded, heavily, with, the, horn, of, africa, some, of, which, it, lingually, semitized, the, adnanite, arabs, inhabiting, the, drier, desert, areas, of, the, middle, east, were, all, nomadic, pastoralists, before, some, began, settling, in, city, states, with, the, geo, linguistic, distribution, today, being, divided, between, persian, gulf, the, najd, and, the, hejaz, in, the, peninsula, as, well, as, the, bedouin, areas, beyond, the, peninsula, since, ancient, times, the, middle, east, has, had, several, lingua, franca, akkadian, c, 14th, 8th, century, bc, hebrew, c, 5th, century, bc, 2nd, century, ad, aramaic, c, 8th, century, bc, 8th, century, ad, greek, c, 4th, century, bc, 8th, century, ad, and, arabic, c, 8th, century, ad, present, familiarity, with, english, is, not, uncommon, among, the, middle, and, upper, classes, arabic, is, not, commonly, spoken, in, turkey, iran, and, israel, and, some, varieties, of, arabic, lack, mutual, intelligibility, thus, qualifying, as, distinct, languages, by, this, linguistic, criterion, the, middle, east, was, the, birthplace, of, the, abrahamic, gnostic, and, most, iranian, religions, initially, the, ancient, inhabitants, of, the, region, followed, various, ethnic, religions, but, most, of, those, began, to, be, gradually, replaced, at, first, by, christianity, even, before, the, 313, ad, edict, of, milan, and, finally, by, islam, after, the, spread, of, the, muslim, conquests, beyond, the, arabian, peninsula, in, 634, ad, to, this, day, however, the, middle, east, has, in, particular, some, sizable, ethnically, distinct, christian, minority, groups, as, well, as, jews, concentrated, in, israel, and, followers, of, iranian, religions, such, as, yazd, nism, and, zoroastrianism, some, of, the, smaller, ethnoreligious, minorities, include, the, shabak, people, the, mandaeans, and, the, samaritans, it, is, somewhat, controversial, whether, the, druze, religion, is, a, distinct, religion, in, its, own, right, or, merely, a, part, of, the, ismailist, branch, of, shia, islam, the, arabian, tectonic, plate, was, part, of, the, african, plate, during, much, of, the, phanerozoic, eon, paleozoic, cenozoic, until, the, oligocene, epoch, of, the, cenozoic, era, red, sea, rifting, began, in, the, eocene, but, the, separation, of, africa, and, arabia, occurred, in, the, oligocene, and, since, then, the, arabian, plate, has, been, slowly, moving, toward, the, eurasian, plate, the, collision, between, the, arabian, plate, and, eurasia, is, pushing, up, the, zagros, mountains, of, iran, because, the, arabian, plate, and, eurasia, plate, collide, many, cities, are, in, danger, such, as, those, in, south, eastern, turkey, which, is, on, the, arabian, plate, these, dangers, include, earthquakes, tsunamis, and, volcanoes, the, earliest, human, migrations, out, of, africa, occurred, through, the, middle, east, namely, over, the, levantine, corridor, with, the, pre, modern, homo, erectus, about, 1, 8, million, years, bp, one, of, the, potential, routes, for, early, human, migrations, toward, southern, and, eastern, asia, is, iran, haplogroup, j, p209, the, most, common, human, y, chromosome, dna, haplogroup, in, the, middle, east, today, is, believed, to, have, arisen, in, the, region, 31, 700, 12, 800, years, ago, the, two, main, current, subgroups, j, m267, and, j, m172, which, now, comprise, between, them, almost, all, of, the, population, of, the, haplogroup, are, both, believed, to, have, arisen, very, early, at, least, 10, 000, years, ago, nonetheless, y, chromosomes, f, m89, and, ij, m429, were, reported, to, have, been, observed, in, the, iranian, plateau, there, is, evidence, of, rock, carvings, along, the, nile, terraces, and, in, desert, oases, in, the, 10th, millennium, bc, a, culture, of, hunter, gatherers, and, fishermen, was, replaced, by, a, grain, grinding, culture, climate, changes, and, or, overgrazing, around, 6000, bc, began, to, desiccate, the, pastoral, lands, of, egypt, forming, the, sahara, early, tribal, peoples, migrated, to, the, nile, river, where, they, developed, a, settled, agricultural, economy, and, more, centralized, society, neolithic, agriculturalists, who, may, have, resided, in, northeast, africa, and, the, near, east, may, have, been, the, source, population, for, lactase, persistence, variants, including, 13910, t, and, may, have, been, subsequently, supplanted, by, later, migrations, of, peoples, the, sub, saharan, west, african, fulani, the, north, african, tuareg, and, european, agriculturalists, who, are, descendants, of, these, neolithic, agriculturalists, share, the, lactase, persistence, variant, 13910, t, while, shared, by, fulani, and, tuareg, herders, compared, to, the, tuareg, variant, the, fulani, variant, of, 13910, t, has, undergone, a, longer, period, of, haplotype, differentiation, the, fulani, lactase, persistence, variant, 13910, t, may, have, spread, along, with, cattle, pastoralism, between, 9686, bp, and, 7534, bp, possibly, around, 8500, bp, corroborating, this, timeframe, for, the, fulani, by, at, least, 7500, bp, there, is, evidence, of, herders, engaging, in, the, act, of, milking, in, the, central, sahara, mesopotamia, egypt, iran, anatolia, the, levant, arabia, cosmology, the, ancient, near, east, was, the, first, to, practice, intensive, year, round, agriculture, and, currency, mediated, trade, as, opposed, to, barter, gave, the, rest, of, the, world, the, first, writing, system, invented, the, potter, s, wheel, and, then, the, vehicular, and, mill, wheel, created, the, first, centralized, governments, and, law, codes, served, as, birthplace, to, the, first, city, states, with, their, high, degree, of, division, of, labor, as, well, as, laying, the, foundation, for, the, fields, of, astronomy, and, mathematics, however, its, empires, also, introduced, rigid, social, stratification, slavery, and, organized, warfare, the, earliest, civilizations, in, history, were, established, in, the, region, now, known, as, the, middle, east, around, 3500, bc, by, the, sumerians, in, southern, mesopotamia, modern, day, iraq, widely, regarded, as, the, cradle, of, civilization, the, sumerians, and, the, akkadians, who, extended, their, empire, to, northern, mesopotamia, now, northern, syria, and, later, babylonians, and, assyrians, all, flourished, in, this, region, in, the, course, of, the, fourth, millennium, bc, city, states, developed, in, southern, mesopotamia, that, were, dominated, by, temples, whose, priests, represented, the, cities, patron, deities, the, most, prominent, of, the, city, states, was, sumer, which, gave, its, language, to, the, area, and, became, the, first, great, civilization, of, mankind, about, 2340, bc, sargon, the, great, c, 2360, 2305, bc, united, the, city, states, in, the, south, and, founded, the, akkadian, dynasty, the, world, s, first, empire, during, this, same, time, period, sargon, the, great, appointed, his, daughter, enheduanna, as, high, priestess, of, inanna, at, ur, her, writings, which, established, her, as, the, first, known, author, in, world, history, also, helped, cement, sargon, s, position, in, the, region, soon, after, the, sumerian, civilization, began, the, nile, valley, of, lower, and, upper, egypt, was, unified, under, the, pharaohs, approximately, around, 3150, bc, since, then, ancient, egypt, experienced, 3, high, points, of, civilization, the, so, called, kingdom, periods, the, history, of, ancient, egypt, is, concluded, by, the, late, period, 664, 332, bc, immediately, followed, by, the, history, of, egypt, in, classical, antiquity, beginning, with, ptolemaic, egypt, thereafter, civilization, quickly, spread, through, the, fertile, crescent, to, the, east, coast, of, the, mediterranean, sea, and, throughout, the, levant, as, well, as, to, ancient, anatolia, ancient, levantine, kingdoms, and, city, states, included, ebla, city, ugarit, city, kingdom, of, aram, damascus, kingdom, of, israel, kingdom, of, judah, kingdom, of, ammon, kingdom, of, moab, kingdom, of, edom, and, the, nabatean, kingdom, the, phoenician, civilization, encompassing, several, city, states, was, a, maritime, trading, culture, that, established, colonial, cities, in, the, mediterranean, basin, most, notably, carthage, in, 814, bc, mesopotamia, was, home, to, several, powerful, empires, that, came, to, rule, almost, the, entire, middle, east, particularly, the, assyrian, empires, of, 1365, 1076, bc, and, the, neo, assyrian, empire, of, 911, 605, bc, the, assyrian, empire, at, its, peak, was, the, largest, the, world, had, seen, it, ruled, all, of, what, is, now, iraq, syria, lebanon, israel, palestine, kuwait, jordan, egypt, cyprus, and, bahrain, with, large, swathes, of, iran, turkey, armenia, georgia, sudan, and, arabia, the, assyrian, empires, particularly, the, third, had, a, profound, and, lasting, impact, on, the, near, east, before, assyrian, hegemony, ended, the, assyrians, brought, the, highest, civilization, to, the, then, known, world, from, the, caspian, to, cyprus, from, anatolia, to, egypt, assyrian, imperial, expansion, would, bring, into, the, assyrian, sphere, nomadic, and, barbaric, communities, and, would, bestow, the, gift, of, civilization, upon, them, from, the, early, 6th, century, bc, onwards, several, persian, states, dominated, the, region, beginning, with, the, medes, and, non, persian, neo, babylonian, empire, then, their, successor, the, achaemenid, empire, known, as, the, first, persian, empire, conquered, in, the, late, 4th, century, bc, by, the, very, short, lived, macedonian, empire, of, alexander, the, great, and, then, successor, kingdoms, such, as, ptolemaic, egypt, and, the, seleucid, state, in, western, asia, after, a, century, of, hiatus, the, idea, of, the, persian, empire, was, revived, by, the, parthians, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, and, continued, by, their, successors, the, sassanids, from, the, 3rd, century, ad, this, empire, dominated, sizable, parts, of, what, is, now, the, asian, part, of, the, middle, east, and, continued, to, influence, the, rest, of, the, asiatic, and, african, middle, east, region, until, the, arab, muslim, conquest, of, persia, in, the, mid, 7th, century, ad, between, the, 1st, century, bc, and, the, early, 7th, century, ad, the, region, was, completely, dominated, by, the, romans, and, the, parthians, and, sassanids, on, the, other, hand, which, often, culminated, in, various, roman, persian, wars, over, the, seven, centuries, eastern, rite, church, of, the, east, christianity, took, hold, in, persian, ruled, mesopotamia, particularly, in, assyria, from, the, 1st, century, ad, onwards, and, the, region, became, a, center, of, a, flourishing, syriac, assyrian, literary, tradition, in, 66, 63, bc, the, roman, general, pompey, conquered, much, of, the, middle, east, the, roman, empire, united, the, region, with, most, of, europe, and, north, africa, in, a, single, political, and, economic, unit, even, areas, not, directly, annexed, were, strongly, influenced, by, the, empire, which, was, the, most, powerful, political, and, cultural, entity, for, centuries, though, roman, culture, spread, across, the, region, the, greek, culture, and, language, first, established, in, the, region, by, the, macedonian, empire, continued, to, dominate, throughout, the, roman, period, cities, in, the, middle, east, especially, alexandria, became, major, urban, centers, for, the, empire, and, the, region, became, the, empire, s, bread, basket, as, the, key, agricultural, producer, gyptus, was, by, far, the, most, wealthy, roman, province, during, the, time, that, mystery, cults, were, introduced, to, the, region, traditional, religions, were, often, criticized, and, the, cults, gained, societal, influence, these, cults, formed, around, gods, like, cybele, isis, and, mithra, as, the, christian, religion, spread, throughout, the, roman, and, persian, empires, it, took, root, in, the, middle, east, and, cities, such, as, alexandria, and, edessa, became, important, centers, of, christian, scholarship, by, the, 5th, century, christianity, was, the, dominant, religion, in, the, middle, east, with, other, faiths, gradually, including, heretical, christian, sects, being, actively, repressed, the, middle, east, s, ties, to, the, city, of, rome, were, gradually, severed, as, the, empire, split, into, east, and, west, with, the, middle, east, tied, to, the, new, roman, capital, of, constantinople, the, subsequent, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, therefore, had, minimal, direct, impact, on, the, region, the, eastern, roman, empire, today, commonly, known, as, the, byzantine, empire, ruling, from, the, balkans, to, the, euphrates, became, increasingly, defined, by, and, dogmatic, about, christianity, gradually, creating, religious, rifts, between, the, doctrines, dictated, by, the, establishment, in, constantinople, and, believers, in, many, parts, of, the, middle, east, by, this, time, greek, had, become, the, lingua, franca, of, the, region, although, ethnicities, such, as, the, syriacs, and, the, hebrew, continued, to, exist, under, byzantine, greek, rule, the, area, of, the, levant, met, an, era, of, stability, and, prosperity, in, the, 5th, century, the, middle, east, was, separated, into, small, weak, states, the, two, most, prominent, were, the, sasanian, empire, of, the, persians, in, what, is, now, iran, and, iraq, and, the, byzantine, empire, in, anatolia, modern, day, turkey, and, the, levant, the, byzantines, and, sasanians, fought, with, each, other, a, reflection, of, the, rivalry, between, the, roman, empire, and, the, persian, empire, seen, during, the, previous, five, hundred, years, the, byzantine, sasanian, rivalry, was, also, seen, through, their, respective, cultures, and, religions, the, byzantines, considered, themselves, champions, of, hellenism, and, christianity, meanwhile, the, sasanians, thought, themselves, heroes, of, ancient, iranian, traditions, and, of, the, traditional, persian, religion, zoroastrianism, the, arabian, peninsula, already, played, a, role, in, the, power, struggles, of, the, byzantines, and, sasanians, while, byzantium, allied, itself, with, the, kingdom, of, aksum, in, the, horn, of, africa, the, sasanian, empire, assisted, the, himyarite, kingdom, in, what, is, now, yemen, southwest, arabia, thus, the, clash, between, the, kingdoms, of, aksum, and, himyar, in, 525, displayed, a, higher, power, struggle, between, byzantium, and, persia, for, control, of, the, red, sea, trade, territorial, wars, soon, became, common, with, the, byzantines, and, sasanians, fighting, over, upper, mesopotamia, and, armenia, and, key, cities, that, facilitated, trade, from, arabia, india, and, china, byzantium, as, the, continuation, of, the, eastern, roman, empire, continued, control, of, the, latter, s, territories, in, the, middle, east, since, 527, this, included, anatolia, syria, lebanon, palestine, and, egypt, but, in, 603, the, sasanians, invaded, conquering, damascus, and, egypt, it, was, emperor, heraclius, who, was, able, to, repel, these, invasions, and, in, 628, he, replaced, the, sasanian, great, king, with, a, more, docile, one, but, the, fighting, weakened, both, states, leaving, the, stage, open, to, a, new, power, the, nomadic, bedouin, tribes, dominated, the, arabian, desert, where, they, worshiped, idols, and, remained, in, small, clans, tied, together, by, kinship, urbanization, and, agriculture, was, limited, in, arabia, save, for, a, few, regions, near, the, coast, mecca, and, medina, then, called, yathrib, were, two, such, cities, that, were, important, hubs, for, trade, between, africa, and, eurasia, this, commerce, was, central, to, city, life, where, most, inhabitants, were, merchants, nevertheless, some, arabs, saw, it, fit, to, migrate, to, the, northern, regions, of, the, fertile, crescent, a, region, so, named, for, its, place, between, the, tigris, and, euphrates, rivers, that, offered, it, fertile, land, this, included, entire, tribal, chiefdoms, such, as, the, lakhmids, in, a, less, controlled, area, of, the, sasanian, empire, and, the, ghassanids, in, a, similar, area, inside, of, byzantine, territory, these, political, units, of, arab, origin, offered, a, surprising, stability, that, was, rare, in, the, region, and, offered, arabia, further, connections, to, the, outside, world, the, lakhmid, capital, hira, was, a, center, for, christianity, and, jewish, craftsmen, merchants, and, farmers, were, common, in, western, arabia, as, were, christian, monks, in, central, arabia, thus, pre, islamic, arabia, was, no, stranger, to, abrahamic, religions, or, monotheism, for, that, matter, while, the, byzantine, roman, and, sassanid, persian, empires, were, both, weakened, by, warfare, 602, 628, a, new, power, in, the, form, of, islam, grew, in, the, middle, east, in, a, series, of, rapid, muslim, conquests, arab, armies, led, by, the, caliphs, and, skilled, military, commanders, such, as, khalid, ibn, al, walid, swept, through, most, of, the, middle, east, taking, more, than, half, of, byzantine, territory, and, completely, engulfing, the, persian, lands, in, anatolia, they, were, stopped, in, the, siege, of, constantinople, 717, 718, by, the, byzantines, who, were, helped, by, the, bulgarians, the, byzantine, provinces, of, roman, syria, north, africa, and, sicily, however, could, not, mount, such, a, resistance, and, the, muslim, conquerors, swept, through, those, regions, at, the, far, west, they, crossed, the, sea, taking, visigothic, hispania, before, being, halted, in, southern, france, in, the, battle, of, tours, by, the, franks, at, its, greatest, extent, the, arab, empire, was, the, first, empire, to, control, the, entire, middle, east, as, well, three, quarters, of, the, mediterranean, region, the, only, other, empire, besides, the, roman, empire, to, control, most, of, the, mediterranean, sea, it, would, be, the, arab, caliphates, of, the, middle, ages, that, would, first, unify, the, entire, middle, east, as, a, distinct, region, and, create, the, dominant, ethnic, identity, that, persists, today, the, seljuq, empire, would, also, later, dominate, the, region, much, of, north, africa, became, a, peripheral, area, to, the, main, muslim, centres, in, the, middle, east, but, iberia, al, andalus, and, morocco, soon, broke, away, from, this, distant, control, and, founded, one, of, the, world, s, most, advanced, societies, at, the, time, along, with, baghdad, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, between, 831, and, 1071, the, emirate, of, sicily, was, one, of, the, major, centres, of, islamic, culture, in, the, mediterranean, after, its, conquest, by, the, normans, the, island, developed, its, own, distinct, culture, with, the, fusion, of, arab, western, and, byzantine, influences, palermo, remained, a, leading, artistic, and, commercial, centre, of, the, mediterranean, well, into, the, middle, ages, africa, was,

conquest, the, kings, of, europe, launched, a, number, of, crusades, to, try, to, roll, back, muslim, power, and, retake, the, holy, land, the, crusades, were, unsuccessful, but, were, far, more, effective, in, weakening, the, already, tottering, byzantine, empire, they, also, rearranged, the, balance, of, power, in, the, muslim, world, as, egypt, once, again, emerged, as, a, major, power,

created, the, need, for, spectacularly, built, mosques, which, created, a, distinct, form, of, architecture, some, of, the, more, magnificent, mosques, include, al, aqsa, and, the, former, mosque, of, cordoba, islam, unified, the, middle, east, and, helped, the, empires, there, to, remain, stable, missionaries, and, warriors, spread, the, religion, from, arabia, to, north, and, sudanic, africa, south, and, southeast, asia, and, the, mesopotamia, area, this, created, a, mix, of, cultures, especially, in, africa, and, the, mawali, demographic, although, the, mawali, would, experience, discrimination, from, the, umayyad, they, would, gain, widespread, acceptance, from, the, abbasids, and, it, was, because, of, this, that, allowed, for, mass, conversions, in, foreign, areas, people, of, the, book, or, dhimmi, were, always, treated, well, these, people, included, christians, jews, hindus, and, zoroastrians, however, the, crusades, started, a, new, thinking, in, the, islamic, empires, that, non, islamic, ideas, were, immoral, or, inferior, this, was, primarily, perpetrated, by, the, ulama, scholars, arabian, culture, took, off, during, the, early, abbasid, age, despite, the, prevalent, political, issues, muslims, saved, and, spread, greek, advances, in, medicine, algebra, geometry, astronomy, anatomy, and, ethics, that, would, later, find, its, way, back, to, western, europe, the, works, of, aristotle, galen, hippocrates, ptolemy, and, euclid, were, saved, and, distributed, throughout, the, empire, and, eventually, into, europe, in, this, manner, muslim, scholars, also, discovered, the, hindu, arabic, numeral, system, in, their, conquests, of, south, asia, the, use, of, this, system, in, muslim, trade, and, political, institutions, allowed, for, the, eventual, popularization, of, it, around, the, world, this, number, system, would, be, critical, to, the, scientific, revolution, in, europe, muslim, intellectuals, would, become, experts, in,

as, to, whom, to, elect, khagan, additionally, societal, clashing, occurred, between, traditionalists, who, wished, to, retain, their, nomadic, culture, and, mongols, moving, towards, sedentary, agriculture, all, of, this, led, to, the, fragmentation, of, the, empire, in, 1260, hulegu, carved, out, his, middle, eastern, territory, into, the, independent, ilkhanate, which, included, most, of, armenia, anatolia, azerbaijan, mesopotamia, and, iran, the, mongols, eventually, retreated, in, 1335, but, the, chaos, that, ensued, throughout, the, empire, deposed, the, seljuq, turks, in, 1401, the, region, was, further, plagued, by, the, turko, mongol, timur, and, his, ferocious, raids, by, then, another, group, of, turks, had, arisen, as, well, the, ottomans, based, in, anatolia, by, 1566,

for, the, first, time, since, the, reign, of, the, abbasid, caliphs, of, the, 10th, century, and, they, kept, control, of, it, for, 400, years, despite, brief, intermissions, created, by, the,

wealth, population, and, technology, some, historians, argue, that, science, had, already, been, in, decline, in, the, muslim, world, since, the, 14th, century, while, other, argue, that, sciences, still, continued, until, the, 17th, century, the, industrial, revolution, and, growth, of, capitalism, magnified, the, divergence, and, from, 1768, to, 1918, the, ottomans, gradually, lost, territory, greece, serbia, romania, and, bulgaria, achieved, independence, during, the, 19th, century, and, the, ottoman, empire, became, known, as, the, sick, man, of, europe, increasingly, under, the, financial, control, of, european, powers, domination, soon, turned, to, outright, conquest, the, french, annexed, algeria, in, 1830, and, tunisia, in, 1878, and, the, british, occupied, egypt, in, 1882, though, it, remained, under, nominal, ottoman, sovereignty, in, the, balkan, wars, of, 1912, 13, the, ottomans, were, driven, out, of, europe, altogether, except, for, the, city, of,

the, italians, seized, libya, and, the, dodecanese, islands, just, off, the, coast, of, the, ottoman, heartland, of, anatolia, the, ottomans, turned, to, germany, to, protect, them, from, the, western, powers, but, the, result, was, increasing, financial, and, military, dependence, on, germany, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, middle, eastern, rulers, tried, to, modernize, their, states, to, compete, more, effectively, with, europe, in, the, ottoman, empire, the, tanzimat, reforms, re, invigorated, ottoman, rule, and, were, furthered, by, the, young, ottomans, in, the, late, 19th, century, leading, to, the, first, constitutional, era, in, the, empire, that, included, the, writing, of, the, 1876, constitution, and, the, establishment, of, the, ottoman, parliament, the, authors, of, the, 1906, revolution, in, persia, all, sought, to, import, versions, of, the, western, model, of, constitutional, government, civil, law, secular, education, and, industrial, development, into, their, countries, throughout, the, region, railways, and, telegraph, lines, were, constructed, schools, and, universities, were, opened, and, a, new, class, of, army, officers, lawyers, teachers, and, administrators, emerged, challenging, the, traditional, leadership, of, islamic, scholars, this, first, ottoman, constitutional, experiment, ended, soon, after, it, began, however, when, the, autocratic, sultan, abdul, hamid, ii, abolished, the, parliament, and, the, constitution, in, favor, of, personal, rule, abdul, hamid, ruled, by, decree, for, the, next, 30, years, stirring, democratic, resentment, the, reform, movement, known, as, the, young, turks, emerged, in, the, 1890s, against, his, rule, which, included, massacres, against, minorities, the, young, turks, seized, power, in, the, 1908, young, turk, revolution, and, established, the, second, constitutional, era, leading, to, a, pluralist, and, multiparty, elections, in, the, empire, for, the, first, time, in, 1908, the, young, turks, split, into, two, parties, the, pro, german, and, pro, centralization, committee, of, union, and, progress, and, the, pro, british, and, pro, decentralization, freedom, and, accord, party, the, former, was, led, by, an, ambitious, pair, of, army, officers, ismail, enver, bey, later, pasha, and, ahmed, cemal, pasha, and, a, radical, lawyer, mehmed, talaat, bey, later, pasha, after, a, power, struggle, between, the, two, parties, of, young, turks, the, committee, emerged, victorious, and, became, a, ruling, junta, with, talaat, as, grand, vizier, and, enver, as, war, minister, and, established, a, german, funded, modernisation, program, across, the, empire, enver, bey, s, alliance, with, germany, which, he, considered, the, most, advanced, military, power, in, europe, was, enabled, by, british, demands, that, the, ottoman, empire, cede, their, formal, capital, edirne, adrianople, to, the, bulgarians, after, losing, the, first, balkan, war, which, the, turks, saw, as, a, betrayal, by, britain, these, demands, cost, britain, the, support, of, the, turks, as, the, pro, british, freedom, and, accord, party, was, now, repressed, under, the, pro, german, committee, for, in, enver, s, words, shamefully, delivering, the, country, to, the, enemy, britain, after, agreeing, to, the, demands, to, give, up, edirne, in, 1878, as, the, result, of, the, cyprus, convention, the, united, kingdom, took, over, the, government, of, cyprus, as, a, protectorate, from, the, ottoman, empire, while, the, cypriots, at, first, welcomed, british, rule, hoping, that, they, would, gradually, achieve, prosperity, democracy, and, national, liberation, they, soon, became, disillusioned, the, british, imposed, heavy, taxes, to, cover, the, compensation, they, paid, to, the, sultan, for, conceding, cyprus, to, them, moreover, the, people, were, not, given, the, right, to, participate, in, the, administration, of, the, island, since, all, powers, were, reserved, to, the, high, commissioner, and, to, london, meanwhile, the, fall, of, the, ottomans, and, the, partitioning, of, anatolia, by, the, allies, led, to, resistance, by, the,

and, the, founding, of, the, modern, republic, of, turkey, in, 1923, atat, rk, the, republic, s, first, president, embarked, on, a, program, of, modernisation, and, secularisation, that, pushed, turkey, both, economically, and, culturally, closer, to, europe, and, away, from, the, arab, world, he, abolished, the, caliphate, emancipated, women, enforced, western, dress, and, the, use, of, a, new, turkish, alphabet, based, on, latin, script, in, place, of, the, arabic, alphabet, and, abolished, the, jurisdiction, of, the, islamic, courts, another, turning, point, came, when, oil, was, discovered, first, in, persia, 1908, and, later, in, saudi, arabia, 1938, as, well, as, the, other, persian, gulf, states, libya, and, algeria, the, middle, east, it, turned, out, possessed, the, world, s, largest, easily, untapped, reserves, of, crude, oil, the, most, important, commodity, in, the, 20th, century, the, discovery, of, oil, in, the, region, made, many, of, the, kings, and, emirs, of, the, middle, east, immensely, wealthy, and, enabled, them, to, consolidate, their, hold, on, power, while, giving, them, a, stake, in, preserving, western, hegemony, over, the, region, as, the, west, became, dependent, on, middle, eastern, oil, exports, and, british, influence, steadily, declined, american, interest, in, the, region, grew, initially, western, oil, companies, established, a, dominance, over, oil, production, and, extraction, however, indigenous, movements, towards, nationalizing, oil, assets, oil, sharing, and, the, advent, of, opec, ensured, a, shift, in, the, balance, of, power, towards, the, arab, oil, states, in, 1914, enver, pasha, s, alliance, with, germany, led, the, ottoman, empire, into, the, fatal, step, of, entering, world, war, i, on, the, side, of, the, central, powers, against, the, entente, an, alliance, that, included, russia, great, britain, and, france, the, british, saw, the, ottomans, as, the, weak, link, in, the, enemy, alliance, and, concentrated, on, knocking, them, out, of, the, war, when, a, direct, assault, failed, at, gallipoli, in, 1916, they, turned, to, fomenting, revolution, in, the, ottoman, domains, exploiting, the, awakening, force, of, arab, armenian, and, assyrian, nationalism, against, the, ottomans, the, british, found, an, ally, in, sharif, hussein, the, hereditary, ruler, of, mecca,

empire, was, abolished, with, most, of, its, territories, ceded, to, britain, and, france, turkey, just, managed, to, survive, the, war, transformed, the, region, in, terms, of, shattering, ottoman, power, which, was, supplanted, by, increased, british, and, french, involvement, the, creation, of, the, middle, eastern, state, system, as, seen, in, turkey, and, saudi, arabia, the, emergence, of, explicitly, more, nationalist, politics, as, seen, in, turkey, and, egypt, and, the, expansion, of, oil, industry, particularly, in, the, gulf, states, when, the, ottoman, empire, surrendered, to, the, allies, in, 1918, the, arab, patriots, did, not, get, what, they, had, expected, islamic, activists, of, more, recent, times, have, described, it, as, an, anglo, french, betrayal, the,

british, mandate, of, palestine, and, was, placed, under, direct, british, administration, the, jewish, population, of, palestine, consisting, overwhelmingly, of, recent, migrants, from, europe, numbered, less, than, 8, percent, in, 1918, under, the, british, mandate, zionist, settlers, were, granted, wide, rein, to, immigrate, initially, buy, land, from, absentee, landlords, set, up, a, local, government, and, later, establish, the, nucleus, of, a, state, all, under, the, protection, of, the, british, army, which, brutally, suppressed, multiple, palestinian, arab, revolts, in, the, years, that, followed, including, in, 1936, the, territory, east, of, the, jordan, river, and, west, of, iraq, was, also, declared, a, british, mandate, when, the, council, of, the, league, of,

the, ultimate, guarantor, of, the, region, s, stability, as, well, as, the, dominant, force, in, the, oil, industry, after, the, 1950s, when, revolutions, brought, radical, anti, western, regimes, to,

allies, the, monarchies, of, saudi, arabia, jordan, iran, and, the, persian, gulf, emirates, whose, methods, of, rule, were, often, almost, as, unattractive, in, western, eyes, as, those, of, the, anti, western, regimes, iran, in, particular, became, a, key, u, s, ally, until, a, revolution, led, by, the, shi, a, clergy, overthrew, the, monarchy, in, 1979, and, established, a, theocratic, state, that, proved, to, be, far, more, anti, western, than, the, secular, regimes, in, iraq, or, syria, the, list, of, arab, israeli, wars, includes, a, great, number, of, major, wars, such, as, 1948, arab, israeli, war, 1956, suez, war, 1967, six, day, war, 1967, 1970, war, of, attrition, 1973, yom, kippur, war, 1982, lebanon, war, as, well, as, a, number, of, lesser, conflicts, of, lower, intensity, in, cyprus, between, 1955, and, 1974, conflict, arising, between, greek, cypriots, and, turkish, cypriots, led, to, cypriot, intercommunal, violence, and, the, turkish, invasion, of, cyprus, the, cyprus, dispute, remains, unresolved, in, the, mid, to, late, 1960s, the, arab, socialist, ba, ath, party, led, by, michel, aflaq, and, salah, al, din, al, bitar, took, power, in, both, iraq, and, syria, iraq, was, first, ruled, by, ahmed, hassan, al, bakr, but, was, succeeded, by, saddam, hussein, in, 1979, and, syria, was, ruled, first, by, a, military, committee, led, by, salah, jadid, and, later, hafez, al, assad, until, 2000, when, he, was, succeeded, by, his, son, bashar, al, assad, in, 1979, egypt, under, nasser, s, successor, anwar, sadat, concluded, a, peace, treaty, with, israel, ending, the, prospects, of, a, united, arab, military, front, from, the, 1970s, the, palestinians, led, by, yasser, arafat, s, palestine, liberation, organization, resorted, to, a, prolonged, campaign, of, violence, against, israel, and, against, american, jewish, and, western, targets, generally, as, a, means, of, weakening, israeli, resolve, and, undermining, western, support, for, israel, the, palestinians, were, supported, in, this, to, varying, degrees, by, the, regimes, in, syria, libya, iran, and, iraq, the, high, point, of, this, campaign, came, in, the, 1975, united, nations, general, assembly, resolution, 3379, condemning, zionism, as, a, form, of, racism, and, the, reception, given, to, arafat, by, the, united, nations, general, assembly, resolution, 3379, was, revoked, in, 1991, by, the, united, nations, general, assembly, resolution, 4686, due, to, many, of, the, frantic, events, of, the, late, 1970s, in, the, middle, east, it, culminated, in, the, iran, iraq, war, between, neighbouring, iran, and, iraq, the, war, started, by, iraq, who, invaded, iranian, khuzestan, in, 1980, at, the, behest, of, the, latter, s, chaotic, state, of, country, due, to, the, 1979, islamic, revolution, eventually, turned, into, a, stalemate, with, hundreds, of, thousands, of, dead, on, both, sides, the, fall, of, the, soviet, union, and, the, collapse, of, communism, in, the, early, 1990s, had, several, consequences, for, the, middle, east, it, allowed, large, numbers, of, soviet, jews, to, emigrate, from, russia, and, ukraine, to, israel, further, strengthening, the, jewish, state, it, cut, off, the, easiest, source, of, credit, armaments, and, diplomatic, support, to, the, anti, western, arab, regimes, weakening, their, position, it, opened, up, the, prospect, of, cheap, oil, from, russia, driving, down, the, price, of, oil, and, reducing, the, west, s, dependence, on, oil, from, the, arab, states, it, discredited, the, model, of, development, through, authoritarian, state, socialism, which, egypt, under, nasser, algeria, syria, and, iraq, had, followed, since, the, 1960s, leaving, these, regimes, politically, and, economically, stranded, rulers, such, as, iraq, s, saddam, hussein, increasingly, relied, on, arab, nationalism, as, a, substitute, for, socialism, saddam, hussein, led, iraq, into, a, prolonged, and, costly, war, with, iran, from, 1980, to, 1988, and, then, into, its, fateful, invasion, of, kuwait, in, 1990, kuwait, had, been, part, of, the, ottoman, province, of, basra, before, 1918, and, thus, in, a, sense, part, of, iraq, even, though, iraq, had, recognized, its, independence, in, 1961, in, response, the, united, states, formed, a, coalition, of, allies, with, saudi, arabia, egypt, and, syria, gained, un, approval, and, evicted, iraq, from, kuwait, by, force, in, the, gulf, war, president, george, h, w, bush, did, not, however, attempt, to, overthrow, saddam, hussein, which, the, united, states, later, came, to, regret, the, gulf, war, led, to, a, permanent, u, s, military, presence, in, the, persian, gulf, particularly, in, saudi, arabia, which, offended, many, muslims, and, was, a, reason, often, cited, by, osama, bin, laden, as, justification, for, the, september, 11, attacks, the, worldwide, change, of, governance, in, eastern, europe, latin, america, east, asia, and, parts, of, africa, following, the, dissolution, of, the, soviet, union, did, not, occur, in, the, middle, east, in, the, whole, region, only, israel, turkey, and, to, some, extent, lebanon, and, the, palestinian, territories, were, considered, to, be, democracies, some, countries, had, legislative, bodies, but, these, were, said, to, have, little, power, in, the, persian, gulf, states, the, majority, of, the, population, could, not, vote, because, they, were, guest, workers, rather, than, citizens, in, most, middle, eastern, countries, the, growth, of, market, economies, was, said, to, be, limited, by, political, restrictions, corruption, and, cronyism, overspending, on, arms, and, prestige, projects, and, over, dependence, on, oil, revenues, the, successful, economies, were, countries, that, had, oil, wealth, and, low, populations, such, as, qatar, bahrain, kuwait, and, the, united, arab, emirates, where, the, ruling, emirs, allowed, some, political, and, social, liberalization, but, without, giving, up, any, of, their, own, power, lebanon, also, rebuilt, a, fairly, successful, economy, after, a, prolonged, civil, war, in, the, 1980s, at, the, beginning, of, the, 21st, century, all, these, factors, intensified, conflict, in, the, middle, east, which, affected, the, entire, world, bill, clinton, s, failed, attempt, to, broker, a, peace, deal, between, israel, and, palestine, at, the, camp, david, summit, in, 2000, led, directly, to, the, election, of, ariel, sharon, as, prime, minister, of, israel, and, to, the, second, intifada, which, conducted, suicide, bombings, on, israeli, civilians, this, was, the, first, major, outbreak, of, violence, since, the, oslo, peace, accords, of, 1993, many, of, the, afghan, jihadists, though, supposedly, none, of, the, arab, volunteers, were, funded, by, the, united, states, under, operation, cyclone, as, part, of, the, reagan, doctrine, one, of, the, longest, and, most, expensive, cia, covert, operations, ever, one, of, these, arab, militants, was, a, wealthy, saudi, arabian, named, osama, bin, laden, after, fighting, against, the, soviets, in, afghanistan, in, the, 1980s, he, formed, the, al, qaida, organization, which, was, responsible, for, the, 1998, u, s, embassy, bombings, the, uss, cole, bombing, and, the, september, 11, 2001, attacks, on, the, united, states, the, september, 11, attacks, led, the, george, w, bush, administration, to, invade, afghanistan, in, 2001, to, overthrow, the, taliban, regime, which, had, been, harboring, bin, laden, and, al, qaida, the, united, states, and, its, allies, described, this, operation, as, part, of, a, global, war, on, terror, in, 2002, u, s, defense, secretary, donald, rumsfeld, developed, a, plan, to, invade, iraq, remove, saddam, from, power, and, turn, iraq, into, a, democratic, state, with, a, free, market, economy, which, they, hoped, would, serve, as, a, model, for, the, rest, of, the, middle, east, the, united, states, and, its, principal, allies, britain, italy, spain, and, australia, could, not, secure, united, nations, approval, for, the, execution, of, the, numerous, un, resolutions, so, they, launched, an, invasion, of, iraq, and, deposed, saddam, without, much, difficulty, in, april, 2003, the, advent, of, a, new, western, army, of, occupation, in, a, middle, eastern, capital, marked, a, turning, point, in, the, history, of, the, region, despite, successful, elections, although, boycotted, by, large, portions, of, iraq, s, sunni, population, held, in, january, 2005, much, of, iraq, had, all, but, disintegrated, due, to, a, post, war, insurgency, which, morphed, into, persistent, ethnic, violence, that, the, american, army, was, initially, unable, to, quell, many, of, iraq, s, intellectual, and, business, elite, fled, the, country, and, many, iraqi, refugees, left, as, a, result, of, the, insurgency, further, destabilizing, the, region, a, responsive, surge, in, u, s, forces, in, iraq, was, largely, successful, in, controlling, the, insurgency, and, stabilizing, the, country, u, s, forces, withdrew, from, iraq, by, december, 2011, by, 2005, president, george, w, bush, s, road, map, for, peace, between, israel, and, the, palestinians, was, stalled, although, this, situation, had, begun, to, change, with, yasser, arafat, s, death, in, 2004, in, response, israel, moved, towards, a, unilateral, solution, pushing, ahead, with, the, israeli, west, bank, barrier, to, protect, israel, from, palestinian, suicide, bombers, and, unilateral, withdrawing, from, gaza, in, 2006, a, new, conflict, erupted, between, israel, and,
