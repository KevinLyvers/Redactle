after, 1707, great, britain, colonization, efforts, began, in, the, late, 16th, century, with, failed, attempts, by, england, to, establish, permanent, colonies, in, the, north, the, first, of, the, permanent, english, colonies, in, the, americas, was, established, in, jamestown, virginia, in, 1607, colonies, were, established, in, north, america, central, america, south, america, and, the, caribbean, though, most, british, colonies, in, the, americas, eventually, gained, independence, some, colonies, have, remained, under, britain, s, jurisdiction, as, british, overseas, territories, the, first, documented, settlement, of, europeans, in, the, americas, was, established, by, norse, people, around, 1000, ad, in, what, is, now, newfoundland, called, vinland, by, the, norse, later, european, exploration, of, north, america, resumed, with, christopher, columbus, s, 1492, expedition, sponsored, by, spain, english, settlement, began, almost, a, century, later, sir, walter, raleigh, established, the, short, lived, roanoke, colony, in, 1585, the, 1607, settlement, of, the, jamestown, colony, grew, into, the, colony, of, virginia, virgineola, settled, unintentionally, by, the, shipwreck, of, the, virginia, company, s, sea, venture, in, 1609, and, renamed, the, somers, isles, is, still, known, by, its, older, spanish, name, bermuda, in, 1620, a, group, of, mostly, pilgrim, religious, separatists, established, a, second, permanent, colony, on, the, mainland, on, the, coast, of, massachusetts, several, other, english, colonies, were, established, in, north, america, during, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, with, the, authorization, of, a, royal, charter, the, hudson, s, bay, company, established, the, territory, of, rupert, s, land, in, the, hudson, bay, drainage, basin, the, english, also, established, or, conquered, several, colonies, in, the, caribbean, including, barbados, and, jamaica, england, captured, the, dutch, colony, of, new, netherland, in, the, anglo, dutch, wars, of, the, mid, 17th, century, leaving, north, america, divided, amongst, the, english, spanish, and, french, empires, after, decades, of, warring, with, france, britain, took, control, of, the, french, colony, of, canada, and, france, s, territory, east, of, the, mississippi, river, as, well, as, several, caribbean, territories, in, 1763, many, of, the, north, american, colonies, gained, independence, from, britain, through, victory, in, the, american, revolutionary, war, which, ended, in, 1783, historians, refer, to, the, british, empire, after, 1783, as, the, second, british, empire, this, period, saw, britain, increasingly, focus, on, asia, and, africa, instead, of, the, americas, and, increasingly, focus, on, the, expansion, of, trade, rather, than, territorial, possessions, nonetheless, britain, continued, to, colonize, parts, of, the, americas, in, the, 19th, century, taking, control, of, british, columbia, and, establishing, the, colonies, of, the, falkland, islands, and, british, honduras, britain, also, gained, control, of, several, colonies, including, trinidad, and, british, guiana, following, the, 1815, defeat, of, france, in, the, napoleonic, wars, in, the, mid, 19th, century, britain, began, the, process, of, granting, self, government, to, its, remaining, colonies, in, north, america, most, of, these, colonies, joined, the, confederation, of, canada, in, the, 1860s, or, 1870s, though, newfoundland, would, not, join, canada, until, 1949, canada, gained, full, autonomy, following, the, passage, of, the, statute, of, westminster, 1931, though, it, retained, various, ties, to, britain, and, still, recognizes, the, british, monarch, as, head, of, state, following, the, onset, of, the, cold, war, most, of, the, remaining, british, colonies, in, the, americas, gained, independence, between, 1962, and, 1983, many, of, the, former, british, colonies, are, part, of, the, commonwealth, of, nations, a, political, association, chiefly, consisting, of, former, colonies, of, the, british, empire, following, the, first, voyage, of, christopher, columbus, in, 1492, spain, and, portugal, established, colonies, in, the, new, world, beginning, the, european, colonization, of, the, americas, france, and, england, the, two, other, major, powers, of, 15th, century, western, europe, employed, explorers, soon, after, the, return, of, columbus, s, first, voyage, in, 1497, king, henry, vii, of, england, dispatched, an, expedition, led, by, john, cabot, to, explore, the, coast, of, north, america, but, the, lack, of, precious, metals, or, other, riches, discouraged, both, the, spanish, and, english, from, permanently, settling, in, north, america, during, the, early, 17th, century, later, explorers, such, as, martin, frobisher, and, henry, hudson, sailed, to, the, new, world, in, search, of, a, northwest, passage, between, the, atlantic, ocean, and, asia, but, were, unable, to, find, a, viable, route, europeans, established, fisheries, in, the, grand, banks, of, newfoundland, and, traded, metal, glass, and, cloth, for, food, and, fur, beginning, the, north, american, fur, trade, during, mid, 1585, bernard, drake, launched, an, expedition, to, newfoundland, which, crippled, the, spanish, and, portuguese, fishing, fleets, there, from, which, they, never, recovered, this, would, have, consequences, in, terms, of, english, colonial, expansion, and, settlement, in, the, caribbean, sea, english, sailors, defied, spanish, trade, restrictions, and, preyed, on, spanish, treasure, ships, the, english, colonization, of, america, had, been, based, on, the, english, colonization, of, ireland, specifically, the, munster, plantation, england, s, first, colony, using, the, same, tactics, as, the, plantations, of, ireland, many, of, the, early, colonists, of, north, america, had, their, start, in, colonizing, ireland, including, a, group, known, as, the, west, country, men, when, sir, walter, raleigh, landed, in, virginia, he, compared, the, native, americans, to, the, wild, irish, both, roanoke, and, jamestown, had, been, based, on, the, irish, plantation, model, in, the, late, sixteenth, century, protestant, england, became, embroiled, in, a, religious, war, with, catholic, spain, seeking, to, weaken, spain, s, economic, and, military, power, english, privateers, such, as, francis, drake, and, humphrey, gilbert, harassed, spanish, shipping, gilbert, proposed, the, colonization, of, north, america, on, the, spanish, model, with, the, goal, of, creating, a, profitable, english, empire, that, could, also, serve, as, a, base, for, the, privateers, after, gilbert, s, death, walter, raleigh, took, up, the, cause, of, north, american, colonization, sponsoring, an, expedition, of, 500, men, to, roanoke, island, in, 1584, the, colonists, established, the, first, permanent, english, colony, in, north, america, but, the, colonists, were, poorly, prepared, for, life, in, the, new, world, and, by, 1590, the, colonists, had, disappeared, there, are, a, variety, of, theories, as, to, what, happened, to, the, colonists, there, the, most, popular, theory, is, that, the, colonists, left, in, search, of, a, new, area, to, settle, in, the, chesapeake, leaving, stragglers, to, integrate, with, local, native, american, tribes, a, separate, colonization, attempt, in, newfoundland, also, failed, despite, the, failure, of, these, early, colonies, the, english, remained, interested, in, the, colonization, of, north, america, for, economic, and, military, reasons, in, 1606, king, james, i, of, england, granted, charters, to, both, the, plymouth, company, and, the, london, company, for, the, purpose, of, establishing, permanent, settlements, in, north, america, in, 1607, the, london, company, established, a, permanent, colony, at, jamestown, on, the, chesapeake, bay, but, the, plymouth, company, s, popham, colony, proved, short, lived, approximately, 30, 000, algonquian, peoples, lived, in, the, region, at, the, time, the, colonists, at, jamestown, faced, extreme, adversity, and, by, 1617, there, were, only, 351, survivors, out, of, the, 1700, colonists, who, had, been, transported, to, jamestown, after, the, virginians, discovered, the, profitability, of, growing, tobacco, the, settlement, s, population, boomed, from, 400, settlers, in, 1617, to, 1240, settlers, in, 1622, the, london, company, was, bankrupted, in, part, due, to, frequent, warring, with, nearby, american, indians, leading, the, english, crown, to, take, direct, control, of, the, colony, of, virginia, as, jamestown, and, its, surrounding, environs, became, known, in, 1609, the, sea, venture, flagship, of, the, english, london, company, a, division, of, the, virginia, company, bearing, admiral, sir, george, somers, and, the, new, lieutenant, governor, for, jamestown, sir, thomas, gates, was, deliberately, driven, onto, the, reef, off, the, archipelago, of, bermuda, to, prevent, its, foundering, during, a, hurricane, on, the, 25th, of, july, the, 150, passengers, and, crew, built, two, new, ships, the, deliverance, and, patience, and, most, departed, bermuda, again, for, jamestown, on, 11, may, 1610, two, men, remained, behind, and, were, joined, by, a, third, after, the, patience, returned, again, then, departed, for, england, it, had, been, meant, to, return, to, jamestown, after, gathering, more, food, in, bermuda, ensuring, that, bermuda, remained, settled, and, in, the, possession, of, england, and, the, london, company, from, 1609, to, 1612, when, more, settlers, and, the, first, lieutenant, governor, arrived, from, england, following, the, extension, of, the, royal, charter, of, the, london, company, to, officially, add, bermuda, to, the, territory, of, virginia, the, archipelago, was, officially, named, virgineola, though, this, was, soon, changed, to, the, somers, isles, which, remains, an, official, name, though, the, archipelago, had, already, long, been, infamous, as, bermuda, and, the, older, spanish, name, has, resisted, replacement, the, lieutenant, governor, and, settlers, who, arrived, in, 1612, briefly, settled, on, smith, s, island, where, the, three, left, behind, by, the, sea, venture, were, thriving, before, moving, to, st, george, s, island, where, they, established, the, town, of, new, london, which, was, soon, renamed, to, st, george, s, town, the, first, actual, town, successfully, established, by, the, english, in, the, new, world, as, jamestown, was, really, james, fort, a, rudimentary, defensive, structure, in, 1612, bermuda, was, soon, more, populous, self, sufficient, and, prosperous, than, jamestown, and, a, second, company, the, company, of, the, city, of, london, for, the, plantacion, of, the, somers, isles, better, known, as, the, somers, isles, company, was, spun, off, from, the, london, company, in, 1615, and, continued, to, administer, bermuda, after, the, london, company, s, royal, charter, was, revoked, in, 1624, the, somers, isles, company, s, royal, charter, was, similarly, revoked, in, 1684, bermuda, pioneered, tobacco, cultivation, as, the, engine, for, its, economic, growth, but, as, virginia, s, tobacco, agriculture, outstripped, it, in, the, 1620s, and, new, colonies, in, the, west, indies, also, emulated, its, tobacco, industry, the, price, of, bermudian, tobacco, fell, and, the, colony, became, unprofitable, for, many, of, the, company, s, shareholders, who, mostly, had, remained, in, england, while, managers, or, tenants, farmed, their, land, in, bermuda, with, the, labour, of, indentured, servants, bermuda, s, house, of, assembly, held, its, first, session, in, 1620, virginia, s, house, of, burgesses, having, held, its, first, session, in, 1619, but, with, no, landowners, resident, in, bermuda, there, was, consequently, no, property, qualification, unlike, the, case, with, the, house, of, commons, as, the, bottom, fell, out, of, tobacco, many, absentee, shareholders, or, adventurers, sold, their, shares, to, the, occupying, managers, or, tenants, with, the, agricultural, industry, quickly, shifting, towards, family, farms, that, grew, subsistence, crops, instead, of, tobacco, bermudians, soon, found, they, could, sell, their, excess, foodstuffs, in, the, west, indies, where, colonies, like, barbados, grew, tobacco, to, the, exclusion, of, subsistence, crops, as, the, company, s, magazine, ship, would, not, carry, their, food, exports, to, the, west, indies, bermudians, began, to, build, their, own, ships, from, bermuda, cedar, developing, the, speedy, and, nimble, bermuda, sloop, and, the, bermuda, rig, between, the, late, 1610s, and, the, american, revolution, the, british, shipped, an, estimated, 50, 000, to, 120, 000, convicts, to, their, american, colonies, meanwhile, the, council, for, new, england, sponsored, several, colonization, projects, including, a, colony, established, by, a, group, of, english, puritans, known, today, as, the, pilgrims, the, puritans, embraced, an, intensely, emotional, form, of, calvinist, protestantism, and, sought, independence, from, the, church, of, england, in, 1620, the, mayflower, transported, the, pilgrims, across, the, atlantic, and, the, pilgrims, established, plymouth, colony, on, cape, cod, the, pilgrims, endured, an, extremely, hard, first, winter, with, roughly, fifty, of, the, one, hundred, colonists, dying, in, 1621, plymouth, colony, was, able, to, establish, an, alliance, with, the, nearby, wampanoag, tribe, which, helped, the, plymouth, colony, adopt, effective, agricultural, practices, and, engaged, in, the, trade, of, fur, and, other, materials, farther, north, the, english, also, established, newfoundland, colony, in, 1610, which, primarily, focused, on, cod, fishing, the, caribbean, would, provide, some, of, england, s, most, important, and, lucrative, colonies, but, not, before, several, attempts, at, colonization, failed, an, attempt, to, establish, a, colony, in, guiana, in, 1604, lasted, only, two, years, and, failed, in, its, main, objective, to, find, gold, deposits, colonies, in, st, lucia, 1605, and, grenada, 1609, also, rapidly, folded, encouraged, by, the, success, of, virginia, in, 1627, king, charles, i, granted, a, charter, to, the, barbados, company, for, the, settlement, of, the, uninhabited, caribbean, island, of, barbados, early, settlers, failed, in, their, attempts, to, cultivate, tobacco, but, found, great, success, in, growing, sugar, the, success, of, colonization, efforts, in, barbados, encouraged, the, establishment, of, more, caribbean, colonies, and, by, 1660, england, had, established, caribbean, sugar, colonies, in, st, kitts, antigua, nevis, and, montserrat, english, colonization, of, the, bahamas, began, in, 1648, after, a, puritan, group, known, as, the, eleutheran, adventurers, established, a, colony, on, the, island, of, eleuthera, england, established, another, sugar, colony, in, 1655, following, the, successful, invasion, of, jamaica, during, the, anglo, spanish, war, spain, acknowledged, english, possession, of, jamaica, and, the, caiman, islands, in, the, 1670, treaty, of, madrid, england, captured, tortola, from, the, dutch, in, 1670, and, subsequently, took, possession, of, the, nearby, islands, of, anegada, and, virgin, gorda, these, islands, would, later, form, the, british, virgin, islands, during, the, 17th, century, the, sugar, colonies, adopted, the, system, of, sugar, plantations, successfully, used, by, the, portuguese, in, brazil, which, depended, on, slave, labour, the, english, government, valued, the, economic, importance, of, these, islands, over, that, of, new, england, until, the, abolition, of, its, slave, trade, in, 1807, britain, was, responsible, for, the, transportation, of, 3, 5, million, african, slaves, to, the, americas, a, third, of, all, slaves, transported, across, the, atlantic, many, of, the, slaves, were, captured, by, the, royal, african, company, in, west, africa, though, others, came, from, madagascar, these, slaves, soon, came, to, form, the, majority, of, the, population, in, caribbean, colonies, like, barbados, and, jamaica, where, strict, slave, codes, were, established, partly, to, deter, slave, rebellions, following, the, success, of, the, jamestown, and, plymouth, colonies, several, more, english, groups, established, colonies, in, the, region, that, became, known, as, new, england, in, 1629, another, group, of, puritans, led, by, john, winthrop, established, the, massachusetts, bay, colony, and, by, 1635, roughly, ten, thousand, english, settlers, lived, in, the, region, between, the, connecticut, river, and, the, kennebec, river, after, defeating, the, pequot, in, the, pequot, war, puritan, settlers, established, the, connecticut, colony, in, the, region, the, pequots, had, formerly, controlled, the, colony, of, rhode, island, and, providence, plantations, was, founded, by, roger, williams, a, puritan, leader, who, was, expelled, from, the, massachusetts, bay, colony, after, he, advocated, for, a, formal, split, with, the, church, of, england, as, new, england, was, a, relatively, cold, and, infertile, region, the, new, england, colonies, relied, on, fishing, and, long, distance, trade, to, sustain, the, economy, in, 1632, cecil, calvert, 2nd, baron, baltimore, founded, the, province, of, maryland, to, the, north, of, virginia, maryland, and, virginia, became, known, as, the, chesapeake, colonies, and, experienced, similar, immigration, and, economic, activities, though, baltimore, and, his, descendants, intended, for, the, colony, to, be, a, refuge, for, catholics, it, attracted, mostly, protestant, immigrants, many, of, whom, scorned, the, calvert, family, s, policy, of, religious, toleration, in, the, mid, 17th, century, the, chesapeake, colonies, inspired, by, the, success, of, slavery, in, barbados, began, the, mass, importation, of, african, slaves, though, many, early, slaves, eventually, gained, their, freedom, after, 1662, virginia, adopted, policies, that, passed, enslaved, status, from, mother, to, child, and, granted, slave, owners, near, total, domination, of, their, human, property, 640, miles, 1, 030, km, east, south, east, of, cape, hatteras, in, the, virginia, company, s, other, former, settlement, the, somers, isles, alias, the, islands, of, bermuda, where, the, spin, off, somers, isles, company, still, administered, the, company, and, its, shareholders, in, england, only, earned, profits, from, the, export, of, tobacco, placing, them, increasingly, at, odds, with, bermudians, for, whom, tobacco, had, become, unprofitable, to, cultivate, as, only, those, landowners, who, could, attend, the, company, s, annual, meetings, in, england, were, permitted, to, vote, on, company, policy, the, company, worked, to, suppress, the, developing, maritime, economy, of, the, colonists, and, to, force, the, production, of, tobacco, which, required, unsustainable, farming, practices, as, more, was, required, to, be, produced, to, make, up, for, the, diminished, value, as, many, of, the, class, of, moneyed, businessmen, who, were, adventurers, in, the, company, were, aligned, to, the, parliamentary, cause, during, the, english, civil, war, bermuda, was, one, of, the, colonies, that, sided, with, the, crown, during, the, war, being, the, first, to, recognise, charles, ii, after, the, execution, of, his, father, with, control, of, their, assembly, and, the, militia, and, volunteer, coastal, artillery, the, royalist, majority, deposed, the, company, appointed, governor, by, the, 1630s, the, company, had, ceased, sending, governors, to, bermuda, and, had, instead, appointed, a, succession, of, prominent, bermudians, to, the, role, including, religious, independent, and, parliamentarian, william, sayle, by, force, of, arms, and, elected, john, trimingham, to, replace, him, many, of, bermuda, s, religious, independents, who, had, sided, with, parliament, were, forced, into, exile, although, some, of, the, newer, continental, colonies, settled, largely, by, anti, episcopalian, protestants, sided, with, parliament, during, the, war, virginia, and, other, colonies, like, bermuda, supported, the, crown, and, were, subjected, to, the, measures, laid, out, in, an, act, for, prohibiting, trade, with, the, barbadoes, virginia, bermuda, and, antego, until, parliament, was, able, to, force, them, to, acknowledge, its, sovereignty, bermudian, anger, at, the, policies, of, the, somers, isles, company, ultimately, saw, them, take, their, complaints, to, the, crown, after, the, restoration, leading, to, the, crown, revoking, the, royal, charter, of, the, somers, isles, company, and, taking, over, direct, administration, of, bermuda, in, 1684, from, that, date, bermudians, abandoned, agriculture, diversifying, their, maritime, industry, to, occupy, many, niches, of, inter, colonial, trade, between, north, america, and, the, west, indies, bermudians, limited, landmass, and, high, birth, rate, meant, that, a, steady, outflow, from, the, colony, contributed, about, 10, 000, settlers, to, other, colonies, notably, the, southern, continental, colonies, including, carolina, province, which, was, settled, from, bermuda, in, 1670, as, well, as, west, indian, settlements, including, the, providence, island, colony, in, 1631, the, bahamas, settled, by, eleutheran, adventurers, parliament, allied, civil, war, exiles, from, bermuda, under, william, sayle, in, the, 1640s, and, the, seasonal, occupation, of, the, turks, islands, from, 1681, encouraged, by, the, apparent, weakness, of, spanish, rule, in, florida, barbadian, planter, john, colleton, and, seven, other, supporters, of, charles, ii, of, england, established, the, province, of, carolina, in, 1663, settlers, in, the, carolina, colony, established, two, main, population, centers, with, many, virginians, settling, in, the, north, of, the, province, and, many, english, barbadians, settling, in, the, southern, port, city, of, charles, town, in, 1712, carolina, was, divided, into, the, crown, colonies, of, north, carolina, and, south, carolina, the, colonies, of, maryland, virginia, north, carolina, and, south, carolina, as, well, as, the, province, of, georgia, which, was, established, in, 1732, became, known, as, the, southern, colonies, beginning, in, 1609, dutch, traders, had, established, fur, trading, posts, on, the, hudson, river, delaware, river, and, connecticut, river, ultimately, creating, the, dutch, colony, of, new, netherland, with, a, capital, at, new, amsterdam, in, 1657, new, netherland, expanded, through, conquest, of, new, sweden, a, swedish, colony, centered, in, the, delaware, valley, despite, commercial, success, new, netherland, failed, to, attract, the, same, level, of, settlement, as, the, english, colonies, in, 1664, during, a, series, of, wars, between, the, english, and, dutch, english, soldier, richard, nicolls, captured, new, netherland, the, dutch, briefly, regained, control, of, parts, of, new, netherland, in, the, third, anglo, dutch, war, but, surrendered, its, claim, to, the, territory, in, the, 1674, treaty, of, westminster, ending, the, dutch, colonial, presence, in, north, america, in, 1664, the, duke, of, york, later, known, as, james, ii, of, england, was, granted, control, of, the, english, colonies, north, of, the, delaware, river, he, created, the, province, of, new, york, out, of, the, former, dutch, territory, and, renamed, new, amsterdam, as, new, york, city, he, also, created, the, provinces, of, west, jersey, and, east, jersey, out, of, former, dutch, land, situated, to, the, west, of, new, york, city, giving, the, territories, to, john, berkeley, and, george, carteret, east, jersey, and, west, jersey, would, later, be, unified, as, the, province, of, new, jersey, in, 1702, charles, ii, rewarded, william, penn, the, son, of, distinguished, admiral, william, penn, with, the, land, situated, between, maryland, and, the, jerseys, penn, named, this, land, the, province, of, pennsylvania, penn, was, also, granted, a, lease, to, the, delaware, colony, which, gained, its, own, legislature, in, 1701, a, devout, quaker, penn, sought, to, create, a, haven, of, religious, toleration, in, the, new, world, pennsylvania, attracted, quakers, and, other, settlers, from, across, europe, and, the, city, of, philadelphia, quickly, emerged, as, a, thriving, port, city, with, its, fertile, and, cheap, land, pennsylvania, became, one, of, the, most, attractive, destinations, for, immigrants, in, the, late, 17th, century, new, york,

monopoly, on, the, fur, trade, in, the, area, known, as, rupert, s, land, forts, and, trading, posts, established, by, the, hbc, were, frequently, the, subject, of, attacks, by, the, french, in, 1695, the, parliament, of, scotland, granted, a, charter, to, the, company, of, scotland, which, established, a, settlement, in, 1698, on, the, isthmus, of, panama, besieged, by, neighbouring, spanish, colonists, of, new, granada, and, afflicted, by, malaria, the, colony, was, abandoned, two, years, later, the, darien, scheme, was, a, financial, disaster, for, scotland, a, quarter, of, scottish, capital, was, lost, in, the, enterprise, and, ended, scottish, hopes, of, establishing, its, own, overseas, empire, the, episode, also, had, major, political, consequences, persuading, the, governments, of, both, england, and, scotland, of, the, merits, of, a, union, of, countries, rather, than, just, crowns, this, occurred, in, 1707, with, the, treaty, of, union, establishing, the, kingdom, of, great, britain, after, succeeding, his, brother, in, 1685, king, james, ii, and, his, lieutenant, edmund, andros, sought, to, assert, the, crown, s, authority, over, colonial, affairs, james, was, deposed, by, the, new, joint, monarchy, of, william, and, mary, in, the, glorious, revolution, but, william, and, mary, quickly, reinstated, many, of, the, james, s, colonial, policies, including, the, mercantilist, navigation, acts, and, the, board, of, trade, the, massachusetts, bay, colony, plymouth, colony, and, the, province, of, maine, were, incorporated, into, the, province, of, massachusetts, bay, and, new, york, and, the, massachusetts, bay, colony, were, reorganized, as, royal, colonies, with, a, governor, appointed, by, the, king, maryland, which, had, experienced, a, revolution, against, the, calvert, family, also, became, a, royal, colony, though, the, calverts, retained, much, of, their, land, and, revenue, in, the, colony, even, those, colonies, that, retained, their, charters, or, proprietors, were, forced, to, assent, to, much, greater, royal, control, than, had, existed, before, the, 1690s, between, immigration, the, importation, of, slaves, and, natural, population, growth, the, colonial, population, in, british, north, america, grew, immensely, in, the, 18th, century, according, to, historian, alan, taylor, the, population, of, the, thirteen, colonies, the, british, north, american, colonies, which, would, eventually, form, the, united, states, stood, at, 1, 5, million, in, 1750, more, than, ninety, percent, of, the, colonists, lived, as, farmers, though, cities, like, philadelphia, new, york, and, boston, flourished, with, the, defeat, of, the, dutch, and, the, imposition, of, the, navigation, acts, the, british, colonies, in, north, america, became, part, of, the, global, british, trading, network, the, colonists, traded, foodstuffs, wood, tobacco, and, various, other, resources, for, asian, tea, west, indian, coffee, and, west, indian, sugar, among, other, items, native, americans, far, from, the, atlantic, coast, supplied, the, atlantic, market, with, beaver, fur, and, deerskins, and, sought, to, preserve, their, independence, by, maintaining, a, balance, of, power, between, the, french, and, english, by, 1770, the, economic, output, of, the, thirteen, colonies, made, up, forty, percent, of, the, gross, domestic, product, of, the, british, empire, prior, to, 1660, almost, all, immigrants, to, the, english, colonies, of, north, america, had, migrated, freely, though, most, paid, for, their, passage, by, becoming, indentured, servants, improved, economic, conditions, and, an, easing, of, religious, persecution, in, europe, made, it, increasingly, difficult, to, recruit, labor, to, the, colonies, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, partly, due, to, this, shortage, of, free, labor, the, population, of, slaves, in, british, north, america, grew, dramatically, between, 1680, and, 1750, the, growth, was, driven, by, a, mixture, of, forced, immigration, and, the, reproduction, of, slaves, in, the, southern, colonies, which, relied, most, heavily, on, slave, labor, the, slaves, supported, vast, plantation, economies, lorded, over, by, increasingly, wealthy, elites, by, 1775, slaves, made, up, one, fifth, of, the, population, of, the, thirteen, colonies, but, less, than, ten, percent, of, the, population, of, the, middle, colonies, and, new, england, colonies, though, a, smaller, proportion, of, the, english, population, migrated, to, british, north, america, after, 1700, the, colonies, attracted, new, immigrants, from, other, european, countries, including, catholic, settlers, from, ireland, and, protestant, germans, as, the, 18th, century, progressed, colonists, began, to, settle, far, from, the, atlantic, coast, pennsylvania, virginia, connecticut, and, maryland, all, lay, claim, to, the, land, in, the, ohio, river, valley, and, the, colonies, engaged, in, a, scramble, to, expand, west, following, the, 1684, revocation, of, the, somers, isles, company, s, royal, charter, seafaring, bermudians, established, an, inter, colonial, trade, network, with, charleston, south, carolina, settled, from, bermuda, in, 1670, under, william, sayle, and, on, the, same, latitude, as, bermuda, although, cape, hatteras, north, carolina, is, the, nearest, landfall, to, bermuda, forming, a, continental, hub, for, their, trade, bermuda, itself, produced, only, ships, and, seamen, the, widespread, activities, and, settlement, of, bermudians, has, resulted, in, many, localities, named, after, bermuda, dotting, the, map, of, north, america, the, glorious, revolution, and, the, succession, of, william, iii, who, had, long, resisted, french, hegemony, as, the, stadtholder, of, the, dutch, republic, ensured, that, england, and, its, colonies, would, come, into, conflict, with, the, french, empire, of, louis, xiv, after, 1689, under, the, leadership, of, samuel, de, champlain, the, french, had, established, quebec, city, on, the, st, lawrence, river, in, 1608, and, it, became, the, center, of, french, colony, of, canada, france, and, england, engaged, in, a, proxy, war, via, native, american, allies, during, and, after, the, nine, years, war, while, the, powerful, iroquois, declared, their, neutrality, war, between, france, and, england, continued, in, queen, anne, s, war, the, north, american, component, of, the, larger, war, of, the, spanish, succession, in, the, 1713, treaty, of, utrecht, which, ended, the, war, of, spanish, succession, the, british, won, possession, of, the, french, territories, of, newfoundland, and, acadia, the, latter, of, which, was, renamed, nova, scotia, in, the, 1730s, james, oglethorpe, proposed, that, the, area, south, of, the, carolinas, be, colonized, to, provide, a, buffer, against, spanish, florida, and, he, was, part, of, a, group, of, trustees, that, were, granted, temporary, proprietorship, over, the, province, of, georgia, oglethorpe, and, his, compatriots, hoped, to, establish, a, utopian, colony, that, banned, slavery, but, by, 1750, the, colony, remained, sparsely, populated, and, georgia, became, a, crown, colony, in, 1752, in, 1754, the, ohio, company, started, to, build, a, fort, at, the, confluence, of, the, allegheny, river, and, the, monongahela, river, a, larger, french, force, initially, chased, the, virginians, away, but, was, forced, to, retreat, after, the, battle, of, jumonville, glen, after, reports, of, the, battle, reached, the, french, and, british, capitals, the, seven, years, war, broke, out, in, 1756, the, north, american, component, of, this, war, is, known, as, the, french, and, indian, war, after, the, duke, of, newcastle, returned, to, power, as, prime, minister, in, 1757, he, and, his, foreign, minister, william, pitt, devoted, unprecedented, financial, resources, to, the, transoceanic, conflict, the, british, won, a, series, of, victories, after, 1758, conquering, much, of, new, france, by, the, end, of, 1760, spain, entered, the, war, on, france, s, side, in, 1762, and, promptly, lost, several, american, territories, to, britain, the, 1763, treaty, of, paris, ended, the, war, and, france, surrendered, almost, all, of, the, portion, of, new, france, to, the, east, of, the, mississippi, river, to, the, british, france, separately, ceded, its, lands, west, of, the, mississippi, river, to, spain, and, spain, ceded, florida, to, britain, with, the, newly, acquired, territories, the, british, created, the, provinces, of, east, florida, west, florida, and, quebec, all, of, which, were, placed, under, military, governments, in, the, caribbean, britain, retained, grenada, st, vincent, dominica, and, tobago, but, returned, control, of, martinique, havana, and, other, colonial, possessions, to, france, or, spain, the, british, subjects, of, north, america, believed, the, unwritten, british, constitution, protected, their, rights, and, that, the, governmental, system, with, the, house, of, commons, the, house, of, lords, and, the, monarch, sharing, power, found, an, ideal, balance, among, democracy, oligarchy, and, tyranny, however, the, british, were, saddled, with, huge, debts, following, the, french, and, indian, war, as, much, of, the, british, debt, had, been, generated, by, the, defense, of, the, colonies, british, leaders, felt, that, the, colonies, should, contribute, more, funds, and, they, began, imposing, taxes, such, as, the, sugar, act, of, 1764, increased, british, control, of, the, thirteen, colonies, upset, the, colonists, and, upended, the, notion, many, colonists, held, that, they, were, equal, partners, in, the, british, empire, meanwhile, seeking, to, avoid, another, expensive, war, with, native, americans, britain, issued, the, royal, proclamation, of, 1763, which, restricted, settlement, west, of, the, appalachian, mountains, however, it, was, effectively, replaced, five, years, later, thanks, to, the, treaty, of, fort, stanwix, the, thirteen, colonies, became, increasingly, divided, between, patriots, opposed, to, parliamentary, taxation, without, representation, and, loyalists, who, supported, the, king, in, the, british, colonies, nearest, to, the, thirteen, colonies, however, protests, were, muted, as, most, colonists, accepted, the, new, taxes, these, provinces, had, smaller, populations, were, largely, dependent, on, the, british, military, and, had, less, of, a, tradition, of, self, rule, at, the, battles, of, lexington, and, concord, in, april, 1775, the, patriots, repulsed, a, british, force, charged, with, seizing, militia, arsenals, the, second, continental, congress, assembled, in, may, 1775, and, sought, to, coordinate, armed, resistance, to, britain, it, established, an, impromptu, government, that, recruited, soldiers, and, printed, its, own, money, announcing, a, permanent, break, with, britain, the, delegates, adopted, a, declaration, of, independence, on, 4, july, 1776, for, the, united, states, of, america, the, french, formed, a, military, alliance, with, the, united, states, in, 1778, following, the, british, defeat, at, the, battle, of, saratoga, spain, joined, france, in, order, to, regain, gibraltar, from, britain, a, combined, franco, american, operation, trapped, a, british, invasion, army, at, yorktown, virginia, forcing, them, to, surrender, in, october, 1781, the, surrender, shocked, britain, the, king, wanted, to, keep, fighting, but, he, lost, control, of, parliament, and, peace, negotiations, began, in, the, 1783, treaty, of, paris, britain, ceded, all, of, its, north, american, territory, south, of, the, great, lakes, except, for, the, two, florida, colonies, which, were, ceded, to, spain, with, their, close, ties, of, blood, and, trade, with, the, continental, colonies, especially, virginia, and, south, carolina, bermudians, leaned, towards, the, rebels, during, the, american, war, of, independence, supplying, them, with, privateering, ships, and, gunpowder, but, the, power, of, the, royal, navy, on, the, surrounding, atlantic, left, no, possibility, of, their, joining, the, rebellion, and, they, eventually, availed, themselves, of, the, opportunities, of, privateering, against, their, former, kinsmen, although, often, mistaken, for, being, in, the, west, indies, bermuda, is, nearer, to, canada, and, was, initially, grouped, within, british, north, america, retaining, close, links, especially, with, the, nova, scotia, and, newfoundland, until, the, continental, colonies, were, confederated, into, canada, than, to, the, west, indies, and, the, nearest, landfall, is, north, carolina, following, the, independence, of, the, united, states, this, would, make, bermuda, of, supreme, importance, to, britain, s, strategic, control, of, the, region, including, its, ability, to, protect, its, shipping, in, the, area, and, its, ability, to, project, its, power, against, the, atlantic, seaboard, of, the, united, states, as, was, to, be, shown, during, the, american, war, of, 1812, having, defeated, a, combined, franco, spanish, naval, force, at, the, decisive, 1782, battle, of, the, saintes, britain, retained, control, of, gibraltar, and, all, its, pre, war, caribbean, possessions, except, for, tobago, economically, the, new, nation, became, a, major, trading, partner, of, britain, the, loss, of, a, large, portion, of, british, america, defined, the, transition, between, the, first, and, second, empires, in, which, britain, shifted, its, attention, away, from, the, americas, to, asia, the, pacific, and, later, africa, influenced, by, the, ideas, of, adam, smith, britain, also, shifted, away, from, mercantile, ideals, and, began, to, prioritize, the, expansion, of, trade, rather, than, territorial, possessions, during, the, nineteenth, century, some, observers, described, britain, as, having, an, unofficial, empire, based, on, the, export, of, goods, and, financial, investments, around, the, world, including, the, newly, independent, republics, of, latin, america, though, this, unofficial, empire, did, not, require, direct, british, political, control, it, often, involved, the, use, of, gunboat, diplomacy, and, military, intervention, to, protect, british, investments, and, ensure, the, free, flow, of, trade, from, 1793, to, 1815, britain, was, almost, constantly, at, war, first, in, the, french, revolutionary, wars, and, then, in, the, napoleonic, wars, during, the, wars, britain, took, control, of, many, french, spanish, and, dutch, caribbean, colonies, tensions, between, britain, and, the, united, states, escalated, during, the, napoleonic, wars, as, the, united, states, took, advantage, of, its, neutrality, to, undercut, the, british, embargo, on, french, controlled, ports, and, britain, tried, to, cut, off, that, american, trade, with, france, the, royal, navy, which, was, desperately, short, of, trained, seamen, and, constantly, losing, deserters, who, sought, better, paid, work, under, less, draconian, discipline, aboard, american, merchant, vessels, boarded, american, ships, to, search, for, deserters, sometimes, resulting, in, the, impressment, of, american, sailors, into, the, royal, navy, the, united, states, at, the, same, time, coveted, the, acquisition, of, canada, which, britain, could, ill, afford, to, lose, as, its, naval, and, merchant, fleets, had, been, constructed, largely, from, american, timber, before, united, states, independence, and, from, canadian, timber, thereafter, taking, advantage, of, britain, s, absorption, in, its, war, with, france, the, united, states, began, the, american, war, of, 1812, with, the, invasion, of, the, canadas, but, the, british, army, mounted, a, successful, defence, with, minimal, regular, forces, supported, by, militia, and, native, allies, while, the, royal, navy, blockaded, the, united, states, of, america, s, atlantic, coastline, from, bermuda, strangling, its, merchant, trade, and, carried, out, amphibious, raids, including, the, chesapeake, campaign, with, its, burning, of, washington, as, the, united, states, failed, to, make, any, gains, before, british, victory, against, france, in, 1814, freed, british, forces, from, europe, to, be, wielded, against, it, and, as, britain, had, no, aim, in, its, war, with, its, former, colonies, other, than, to, defend, its, remaining, continental, territory, the, war, ended, with, the, pre, war, boundaries, reaffirmed, by, the, 1814, treaty, of, ghent, ensuring, canada, s, future, would, be, separate, from, that, of, the, united, states, following, the, final, defeat, of, french, emperor, napoleon, in, 1815, britain, gained, ownership, of, trinidad, tobago, british, guiana, and, saint, lucia, as, well, as, other, territories, outside, of, the, western, hemisphere, the, treaty, of, 1818, with, the, united, states, set, a, large, portion, of, the, canada, united, states, border, at, the, 49th, parallel, and, also, established, a, joint, u, s, british, occupation, of, oregon, country, in, the, 1846, oregon, treaty, the, united, states, and, britain, agreed, to, split, oregon, country, along, the, 49th, parallel, north, with, the, exception, of, vancouver, island, which, was, assigned, in, its, entirety, to, britain, after, warring, throughout, the, eighteenth, and, nineteenth, centuries, in, both, europe, and, the, americas, the, british, and, french, reached, a, lasting, peace, after, 1815, britain, would, fight, only, one, war, the, crimean, war, against, a, european, power, during, the, remainder, of, the, nineteenth, century, and, that, war, did, not, lead, to, territorial, changes, in, the, americas, however, the, british, empire, continued, to, engage, in, wars, such, as, the, first, opium, war, against, china, it, also, put, down, rebellions, such, as, the, indian, rebellion, of, 1857, the, canadian, rebellions, of, 1837, 1838, and, the, jamaican, morant, bay, rebellion, of, 1865, a, strong, abolition, movement, had, emerged, in, the, united, kingdom, in, the, late, eighteenth, century, and, britain, abolished, the, slave, trade, in, 1807, in, the, mid, nineteenth, century, the, economies, of, the, british, caribbean, colonies, would, suffer, as, a, result, of, the, slavery, abolition, act, 1833, which, abolished, slavery, throughout, the, british, empire, and, the, 1846, sugar, duties, act, which, ended, preferential, tariffs, for, sugar, imports, from, the, caribbean, to, replace, the, labor, of, former, slaves, british, plantations, on, trinidad, and, other, parts, of, the, caribbean, began, to, hire, indentured, servants, from, india, and, china, despite, its, defeat, in, the, american, revolutionary, war, and, shift, towards, a, new, form, of, imperialism, during, the, nineteenth, century, the, british, empire, retained, numerous, colonies, in, the, americas, after, 1783, during, and, after, the, american, revolutionary, war, between, 40, 000, and, 100, 000, defeated, loyalists, migrated, from, the, united, states, to, canada, the, 14, 000, loyalists, who, went, to, the, saint, john, and, saint, croix, river, valleys, then, part, of, nova, scotia, felt, too, far, removed, from, the, provincial, government, in, halifax, so, london, split, off, new, brunswick, as, a, separate, colony, in, 1784, the, constitutional, act, of, 1791, created, the, provinces, of, upper, canada, mainly, english, speaking, and, lower, canada, mainly, french, speaking, to, defuse, tensions, between, the, french, and, british, communities, and, implemented, governmental, systems, similar, to, those, employed, in, britain, with, the, intention, of, asserting, imperial, authority, and, not, allowing, the, sort, of, popular, control, of, government, that, was, perceived, to, have, led, to, the, american, revolution, the, british, also, expanded, their, mercantile, interests, in, the, north, pacific, spain, and, britain, had, become, rivals, in, the, area, which, came, to, a, head, with, the, nootka, crisis, in, 1789, both, sides, mobilised, for, war, and, spain, counted, on, france, for, support, but, when, france, refused, spain, had, to, back, down, and, capitulated, to, british, terms, leading, to, the, nootka, convention, the, outcome, of, the, crisis, was, a, humiliation, for, spain, and, a, triumph, for, britain, for, the, former, had, practically, renounced, all, sovereignty, on, the, north, pacific, coast, this, opened, the, way, to, british, expansion, in, that, area, and, a, number, of, expeditions, took, place, firstly, a, naval, expedition, led, by, george, vancouver, which, explored, the, inlets, around, the, pacific, northwest, particularly, around, vancouver, island, on, land, expeditions, took, place, hoping, for, a, discovery, of, a, practicable, river, route, to, the, pacific, for, the, extension, of, the, north, american, fur, trade, the, north, west, company, sir, alexander, mackenzie, led, the, first, starting, out, in, 1792, and, a, year, a, later, he, became, the, first, european, to, reach, the, pacific, overland, north, of, the, rio, grande, reaching, the, ocean, near, present, day, bella, coola, this, preceded, the, lewis, and, clark, expedition, by, twelve, years, shortly, thereafter, mackenzie, s, companion, john, finlay, founded, the, first, permanent, european, settlement, in, british, columbia, fort, st, john, the, north, west, company, sought, further, explorations, firstly, by, david, thompson, starting, in, 1797, and, later, by, simon, fraser, more, expedition, took, place, in, the, early, 1800s, and, pushed, into, the, wilderness, territories, of, the, rocky, mountains, and, interior, plateau, and, all, the, way, to, the, strait, of, georgia, on, the, pacific, coast, expanding, british, north, america, westward, in, 1815, lieutenant, general, sir, george, prevost, was, captain, general, and,

1860s, which, resulted, in, the, removal, of, the, british, army, from, canada, and, its, commander, in, chief, from, halifax, when, the, canadian, government, took, responsibility, for, the, defence, of, canada, the, naval, links, remained, until, the, royal, navy, withdrew, from, halifax, in, 1905, handing, its, dockyard, there, over, to, the, royal, canadian, navy, the, established, church, of,

granted, to, nova, scotia, in, 1848, and, was, soon, extended, to, the, other, british, north, american, colonies, with, the, passage, of, the, british, north, america, act, 1867, by, the, british, parliament, upper, and, lower, canada, new, brunswick, and, nova, scotia, were, formed, into, the, confederation, of, canada, rupert, s, land, which, was, divided, into, manitoba, and, the, northwest,

as, australia, new, zealand, and, south, africa, canada, enjoyed, autonomy, over, its, domestic, affairs, but, recognized, the, british, monarch, as, head, of, state, and, cooperated, closely, with,

west, indies, submarine, telegraph, cable, as, a, wireless, station, and, from, the, 1930s, as, a, site, for, airbases, used, as, a, staging, point, for, trans, atlantic, flights, and, for, operating,

small, british, settlement, had, been, established, on, the, belize, river, though, the, spanish, refused, to, recognize, british, control, over, the, region, and, frequently, evicted, british, settlers, in, the, 1783, treaty, of, paris, and, the, 1786, convention, of, london, spain, gave, britain, the, right, to, cut, logwood, and, mahogany, in, the, area, between, the, hondo, river, and, the, belize, river, but, spain, retained, sovereignty, over, this, area, following, the, 1850, clayton, bulwer, treaty, with, the, united, states, britain, agreed, to, evacuate, its, settlers, from, the, bay, islands, and, the, mosquito, coast, but, it, retained, control, of, the, settlement, on, the, belize, river, in, 1862, britain, established, the, crown, colony, of, the, british, honduras,

the, uninhabited, south, georgia, island, which, had, been, claimed, by, captain, james, cook, in, 1775, as, a, dependency, of, the, falkland, islands, with, the, onset, of, the, cold, war, in, the, late, 1940s, the, british, government, began, to, assemble, plans, for, the, independence, of, the, empire, s, colonies, in, africa, asia, and, the, americas, british, authorities, initially, planned, for, a, three, decades, long, process, in, which, each, colony, would, develop, a, self, governing, and, democratic, parliament, but, unrest, and, fears, of, communist, infiltration, in, the, colonies, encouraged, the, british, to, speed, up, the, move, towards, self, governance, compared, to, other, european, empires, which, experienced, wars, of, independence, such, as, the, algerian, war, and, the, portuguese, colonial, war, the, british, post, war, process, of, decolonization, in, the, caribbean, was, relatively, peaceful, in, an, attempt, to, unite, its, caribbean, colonies,

in, 1964, and, was, renamed, belize, in, 1973, achieving, full, independence, in, 1981, a, dispute, with, guatemala, over, claims, to, belize, was, left, unresolved, though, many, of, the, caribbean, territories, of, the, british, empire, gained, independence, anguilla, and, the, turks, and, caicos, islands, opted, to, revert, to, british, rule, after, they, had, already, started, on, the, path, to, independence, the, british, virgin, islands, bermuda, the, cayman, islands, montserrat, and, the, falkland, islands, also, remain, under, the, jurisdiction, of, britain, in, 1982, britain, defeated, argentina, in, the, falklands, war, an, undeclared, war, in, which, argentina, attempted, to, seize, control, of, the, falkland, islands, in, 1983, the, british, nationality, act, 1981, renamed, the, existing, british, colonies, as, british, dependent, territories, historically, colonials, shared, the, same, citizenship, although, magna, carta, had, effectively, created, english, citizenship, citizens, were, still, termed, subjects, of, the, king, of, england, or, english, subjects, with, the, union, of, the, kingdoms, of, england, and, scotland, this, was, replaced, with, british, subject, which, encompassed, citizens, throughout, the, sovereign, territory, of, the, british, government, including, the, colonies, as, britons, although, historically, all, british, subjects, had, the, right, to, vote, for, candidates, or, to, themselves, stand, for, election, to, the, house, of, commons, providing, that, they, were, male, prior, to, women, s, suffrage, and, met, the, property, qualification, when, it, applied, the, british, government, as, with, the, government, of, the, kingdom, of, england, before, it, has, never, assigned, seats, in, the, house, of, commons, to, any, colony, effectively, disenfranchising, colonials, at, the, sovereign, level, of, their, government, there, has, also, never, been, a, peer, in, the, house, of, lords, representing, any, colony, colonials, were, therefore, not, consulted, or, required, to, give, their, consent, to, a, series, of, acts, that, passed, by, the, parliament, of, the, united, kingdom, between, 1968, and, 1982, which, were, to, limit, their, rights, and, ultimately, change, their, citizenship, when, several, colonies, were, elevated, before, the, second, world, war, to, dominion, status, collectively, forming, the, old, british, commonwealth, as, distinct, from, the, united, kingdom, and, its, dependent, colonies, their, citizens, remained, british, subjects, and, in, theory, any, british, subject, born, anywhere, in, the, world, had, the, same, basic, right, to, enter, reside, and, work, in, the, united, kingdom, as, a, british, subject, born, in, the, united, kingdom, whose, parents, were, also, both, british, subjects, born, in, the, united, kingdom, although, many, governmental, policies, and, practices, acted, to, thwart, the, free, exercise, of, these, right, by, various, demographic, groups, of, colonials, including, greek, cypriots, when, the, dominions, and, an, increasing, number, of, colonies, began, choosing, complete, independence, from, the, united, kingdom, after, the, second, world, war, the, commonwealth, was, transformed, into, a, community, of, independent, nations, each, recognising, the, british, monarch, as, their, own, head, of, state, creating, separate, monarchies, with, the, same, person, occupying, all, of, the, separate, thrones, the, exception, being, republican, india, british, subject, was, replaced, by, the, british, nationality, act, 1948, with, citizen, of, the, united, kingdom, and, colonies, for, the, residents, of, the, united, kingdom, and, its, colonies, as, well, as, the, crown, dependencies, however, as, it, was, desired, to, retain, free, movement, for, all, commonwealth, citizens, throughout, the, commonwealth, british, subject, was, retained, as, a, blanket, nationality, shared, by, citizens, of, the, united, kingdom, and, colonies, as, well, as, the, citizens, of, the, various, other, commonwealth, realms, the, inflow, of, coloured, people, to, the, united, kingdom, during, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, from, both, remaining, colonies, and, newly, independent, commonwealth, nations, was, responded, to, with, a, racist, backlash, that, led, to, the, passing, of, the, commonwealth, immigrants, act, 1962, which, restricted, the, rights, of, commonwealth, nationals, to, enter, reside, and, work, in, the, united, kingdom, this, act, also, allowed, certain, colonials, primarily, ethnic, indians, in, african, colonies, to, retain, citizenship, of, the, united, kingdom, and, colonies, if, their, colonies, became, independent, intended, as, a, measure, to, ensure, these, persons, did, not, become, stateless, if, they, were, denied, the, citizenship, of, their, newly, independent, nation, many, ethnic, indians, did, find, themselves, marginalised, in, newly, independent, nations, notably, kenya, and, relocated, to, the, united, kingdom, in, response, to, which, the, commonwealth, immigrants, act, 1968, was, rapidly, passed, stripping, all, british, subjects, including, citizens, of, the, united, kingdom, and, colonies, who, were, not, born, in, the, united, kingdom, and, who, did, not, have, a, citizen, of, the, united, kingdom, and, colonies, parent, born, in, the, united, kingdom, or, some, other, qualification, such, as, existing, residence, status, of, the, rights, to, freely, enter, reside, and, work, in, the, united, kingdom, this, was, followed, by, the, immigration, act, 1971, which, effectively, divided, citizens, of, the, united, kingdom, and, colonies, into, two, types, although, their, citizenship, remained, the, same, those, from, the, united, kingdom, itself, who, retained, the, rights, of, free, entry, abode, and, work, in, the, united, kingdom, and, those, born, in, the, colonies, or, in, foreign, countries, to, british, colonial, parents, from, whom, those, rights, were, denied, the, british, nationality, act, 1981, which, entered, into, force, on, 1, january, 1983, abolished, british, subject, status, and, stripped, colonials, of, their, full, british, citizen, of, the, united, kingdom, and, colonies, replacing, it, with, british, dependent, territories, citizenship, which, entailed, no, right, of, abode, or, to, work, anywhere, other, categories, with, even, fewer, rights, were, created, at, the, same, time, including, british, overseas, citizen, for, former, citizens, of, the, united, kingdom, and, colonies, born, in, ex, colonies, the, exceptions, were, the, gibraltarians, permitted, to, retain, british, nationality, in, order, to, retain, citizenship, of, the, european, union, and, the, falkland, islanders, who, were, permitted, to, retain, the, same, new, british, citizenship, that, became, the, default, citizenship, for, those, from, the, united, kingdom, and, the, crown, dependencies, as, the, act, was, widely, understood, to, have, been, passed, in, preparation, for, the, 1997, handover, of, hong, kong, to, the, people, s, republic, of, china, in, order, to, prevent, ethnic, chinese, british, nationals, from, migrating, to, the, united, kingdom, and, given, the, history, of, neglect, and, racism, those, colonies, with, sizeable, non, european, to, use, the, british, government, s, parlance, populations, had, endured, from, the, british, government, since, the, end, of, empire, the, application, of, the, act, only, to, those, colonies, in, which, the, citizenship, was, changed, to, british, dependent, territories, citizenship, has, been, perceived, as, a, particularly, egregious, example, of, the, racism, of, the, british, government, the, stripping, of, birth, rights, from, at, least, some, of, the, colonial, cukcs, in, 1968, and, 1971, and, the, change, of, their, citizenships, in, 1983, actually, violated, the, rights, granted, them, by, royal, charters, at, the, founding, of, the, colonies, bermuda, fully, the, somers, isles, or, islands, of, bermuda, by, example, had, been, settled, by, the, london, company, which, had, been, in, occupation, of, the, archipelago, since, the, 1609, wreck, of, the, sea, venture, in, 1612, when, it, received, its, third, royal, charter, from, king, james, i, amending, the, boundaries, of, the, first, colony, of, virginia, far, enough, across, the, atlantic, to, include, bermuda, the, citizenship, rights, guaranteed, to, settlers, by, king, james, i, in, the, original, royal, charter, of, the, 10, april, 1606, thereby, applied, to, bermudians, alsoe, wee, doe, for, us, our, heires, and, successors, declare, by, theise, presentes, that, all, and, everie, the, parsons, being, our, subjects, which, shall,

purposes, as, if, they, had, been, abiding, and, borne, within, this, our, realme, of, englande, or, anie, other, of, our, saide, dominions, these, rights, were, confirmed, in, the, royal, charter, granted, to, the, london, company, s, spin, off, the, company, of, the, city, of, london, for, the, plantacion, of, the, somers, isles, in, 1615, on, bermuda, being, separated, from, virginia, and,

the, 10, july, 2001, stated, citizenship, was, granted, irrevocably, by, charles, i, it, was, taken, away, quite, wrongly, by, parliament, in, surrender, to, the, largely, racist, opposition, to, immigration, at, the, time, some, conservative, party, backbenchers, stated, that, it, was, the, unpublished, intention, of, the, conservative, british, government, to, return, to, a, single, citizenship, for, the, united, kingdom, and, all, of, the, remaining, territories, once, hong, kong, had, been, handed, over, to, china, whether, this, was, so, will, never, be, known, as, by, 1997, the, labour, party, was, in, government, the, labour, party, had, declared, prior, to, the, election, that, the, colonies, had, been, ill, treated, by, the, british, nationality, act, 1981, and, it, had, made, a, promise, to, return, to, a, single, citizenship, for, the, united, kingdom, and, the, remaining, territories, part, of, its, election, manifesto, other, matters, took, precedence, however, and, this, commitment, was, not, acted, upon, during, labour, s, first, term, in, government, the, house, of, lords, in, which, many, former, colonial, governors, sat, lost, patience, and, tabled, and, passed, its, own, bill, then, handed, it, down, to, the, house, of, commons, to, confirm, as, a, result, the, british, dependent, territories, were, renamed, the, british, overseas, territories, in, 2002, the, term, dependent, territory, had, caused, much, ire, in, the, former, colonies, such, as, well, heeled, bermuda, that, had, been, largely, self, reliant, and, self, governed, for, nearly, four, centuries, as, it, implied, not, only, that, they, were, other, than, british, but, that, their, relationship, to, britain, and, to, real, british, people, was, both, inferior, and, parasitic, at, the, same, time, although, labour, had, promised, a, return, to, a, single, citizenship, for, the, united, kingdom, crown, dependencies, and, all, remaining, territories, british, dependent, territories, citizenship, renamed, british, overseas, territories, citizenship, remained, the, default, citizenship, for, the, territories, other, than, the, falkland, islands, and, gibraltar, for, which, british, citizenship, is, still, the, default, citizenship, the, bars, to, residence, and, work, in, the, united, kingdom, that, had, been, raised, against, holders, of, british, dependent, territories, citizenship, by, the, british, nationality, act, 1981, were, however, removed, and, british, citizenship, was, made, attainable, by, simply, obtaining, a, second, british, passport, with, the, citizenship, recorded, as, british, citizen, requiring, a, change, to, passport, legislation, as, prior, to, 2002, it, had, been, illegal, to, possess, two, british, passports, prior, to, 2002, all, british, passports, obtained, in, a, british, dependent, territory, were, of, a, design, modified, from, those, issued, in, the, united, kingdom, lacking, the, european, union, name, on, the, front, cover, having, the, name, of, the, specific, territorial, government, noted, on, the, front, cover, below, british, passport, and, having, the, request, on, the, inside, of, the, front, cover, normally, issued, by, the, secretary, of, state, on, behalf, of, the, queen, instead, issued, by, the, governor, of, the, territory, on, behalf, of, the, queen, although, this, design, made, it, easier, for, united, kingdom, border, control, to, distinguish, a, colonial, from, a, real, british, citizen, these, passports, were, issued, within, the, territory, to, the, holder, of, any, type, of, british, citizenship, with, the, appropriate, citizenship, stamped, inside, the, normal, british, passports, issued, in, the, united, kingdom, and, by, british, consulates, in, commonwealth, and, foreign, countries, were, similarly, issued, to, holders, of, any, type, of, british, citizenship, with, the, appropriate, citizenship, or, citizenships, stamped, inside, from, 2002, the, thenceforth, local, governments, of, the, british, overseas, territories, in, which, british, overseas, territories, citizenship, was, the, default, citizenship, were, no, longer, allowed, to, issue, or, replace, any, british, passport, except, the, type, for, their, own, territory, only, with, british, overseas, territories, citizen, recorded, inside, and, a, stamp, from, the, local, government, showing, the, holder, has, legal, status, as, a, local, in, bermuda, by, example, the, stamp, records, the, holder, is, registered, as, a, bermudian, as, neither, british, dependent, territories, citizenship, nor, british, overseas, territories, citizenship, actually, entitles, the, holder, to, any, more, rights, in, any, territory, than, in, the, united, kingdom, simply, serving, to, enable, colonials, to, be, distinguished, from, real, british, people, for, the, benefit, of, united, kingdom, border, control, since, 2002, only, the, united, kingdom, government, has, issued, normal, british, passports, with, the, citizenship, stamped, as, british, citizen, since, june, 2016, only, the, passport, office, in, the, united, kingdom, is, permitted, to, issue, any, type, of, british, passport, local, governments, of, territories, can, still, accept, passport, applications, but, must, forward, them, to, the, passport, office, this, means, that, the, territorial, pattern, of, british, passport, is, no, longer, available, with, all, passports, issued, since, then, being, of, the, standard, type, issued, in, the, united, kingdom, with, the, appropriate, type, of, british, citizenship, recorded, inside, a, problem, for, bermudians, as, they, have, always, enjoyed, freer, entry, into, the, united, states, than, other, british, citizens, but, the, united, states, had, updated, its, entry, requirements, prior, to, the, 2001, terrorist, attacks, on, new, york, city, and, washington, d, c, bermudians, did, not, need, a, passport, to, enter, the, us, and, americans, did, not, need, a, passport, to, enter, bermuda, since, then, anyone, entering, the, us, including, us, citizens, must, present, a, passport, to, specify, that, in, order, to, be, admitted, as, a, bermudian, the, passport, must, be, of, the, territorial, type, specific, to, bermuda, with, the, country, code, inside, being, that, used, for, bermuda, as, distinct, from, other, parts, of, the, british, realm, with, the, citizenship, stamped, as, british, dependent, territories, citizenship, or, british, overseas, territories, citizenship, and, the, stamp, from, bermuda, immigration, showing, the, holder, has, bermudian, status, from, the, point, of, view, of, bermuda, immigration, only, the, stamp, showing, the, holder, has, bermudian, status, indicates, the, holder, is, bermudian, and, that, can, be, entered, into, any, type, of, british, passport, with, any, type, of, british, citizenship, recorded, so, the, united, states, requirements, are, more, stringent, than, bermuda, s, and, impossible, to, meet, with, any, british, passport, issued, to, a, bermudian, since, the, end, of, june, 2016, the, eleven, inhabited, territories, are, self, governing, to, varying, degrees, and, are, reliant, on, the, uk, for, foreign, relations, and, defence, most, former, british, colonies, and, protectorates, are, among, the, 52, member, states, of, the, commonwealth, of, nations, a, non, political, voluntary, association, of, equal, members, comprising, a, population, of, around, 2, 2, billion, people, fifteen, commonwealth, realms, including, canada, and, several, countries, in, the, caribbean, voluntarily, continue, to, share, the, british, monarch, king, charles, iii, as, their, head, of, state, these, colonies, and, territories, known, together, with, bermuda, as, british, north, america, following, independence, of, the, united, states, of, america, were, confederated, to, form, modern, canada, between, 1867, and, 1873, unless, otherwise, noted, the, thirteen, colonies, which, became, the, original, states, of, the, united, states, following, the, 1781, ratification, of, the, articles, of, confederation, these, colonies, were, acquired, in, 1763, and, ceded, to, spain, in, 1783, these, present, day, countries, formed, part, of, the, british, west, indies, prior, to, gaining, independence, during, the, 20th, century, these, british, overseas, territories, in, the, americas, remain, under, the, jurisdiction, of, the, united, kingdom
