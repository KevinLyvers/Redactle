modest, and, responsible, course, and, following, that, date, there, was, ceaseless, activity, and, aggression, prior, to, the, italian, invasion, of, ethiopia, mussolini, had, made, military, agreements, with, the, french, and, formed, a, coalition, with, the, british, and, french, to, prevent, german, aggression, in, europe, the, ethiopian, war, exposed, vulnerabilities, and, created, opportunities, that, mussolini, seized, to, realise, his, imperial, vision, at, the, nyon, conference, of, 1937, italy, and, the, united, kingdom, disclaimed, any, desire, to, modify, or, see,

from, british, australian, and, new, zealand, forces, in, anticipation, of, the, german, attack, the, greek, army, found, itself, outnumbered, in, its, effort, to, defend, against, both, italian, and, german, troops, as, a, result, the, metaxas, defensive, line, did, not, receive, adequate, troop, reinforcements, and, was, quickly, overrun, by, the, germans, who, then, outflanked, the, greek, forces, at, the, albanian, border, forcing, their, surrender, british, australian, and, new, zealand, forces, were, overwhelmed, and, forced, to, retreat, with, the, ultimate, goal, of, evacuation,

central, macedonia, were, isolated, from, the, commonwealth, forces, moving, up, in, an, attempt, stabilise, the, front, with, the, germans, then, falling, on, the, rear, of, the, main, greek, army, facing, the, italians, in, macedonia, the, german, advance, into, greece, was, made, easier, because, the, bulk, of, the, greek, army, was, engaged, fighting, the, italians, on, the, albanian, front,

of, greece, andreas, hillgruber, has, accused, hitler, of, trying, to, deflect, blame, for, his, country, s, defeat, from, himself, to, his, ally, italy, it, nevertheless, had, serious, consequences, for, the, axis, war, effort, in, the, north, african, theatre, enno, von, rintelen, who, was, the, military, attach, in, rome, emphasises, from, the, german, point, of, view, the, strategic, mistake,
