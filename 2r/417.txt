of, all, saints, at, around, 09, 40, local, time, in, combination, with, subsequent, fires, and, a, tsunami, the, earthquake, almost, completely, destroyed, lisbon, and, adjoining, areas, seismologists, estimate, the, lisbon, earthquake, had, a, magnitude, of, 7, 7, or, greater, on, the, moment, magnitude, scale, with, its, epicenter, in, the, atlantic, ocean, about, 200, km, 110, nmi, 120, mi, west, southwest, of, cape, st, vincent, a, cape, in, algarve, region, and, about, 290, km, 160, nmi, 180, mi, southwest, of, lisbon, chronologically, it, was, the, third, known, large, scale, earthquake, to, hit, the, city, following, those, of, 1321, and, 1531, estimates, place, the, death, toll, in, lisbon, around, 30, 000, 40, 000, a, further, 10, 000, may, have, died, in, morocco, the, earthquake, accentuated, political, tensions, in, portugal, and, profoundly, disrupted, the, portuguese, empire, the, event, was, widely, discussed, and, dwelt, upon, by, european, enlightenment, philosophers, and, inspired, major, developments, in, theodicy, as, the, first, earthquake, studied, scientifically, for, its, effects, over, a, large, area, it, led, to, the, birth, of, modern, seismology, and, earthquake, engineering, the, earthquake, struck, on, the, morning, of, 1, november, 1755, all, saints, day, contemporary, reports, state, that, the, earthquake, lasted, from, three, and, a, half, to, six, minutes, causing, fissures, 5, metres, 16, ft, wide, in, the, city, center, survivors, rushed, to, the, open, space, of, the, docks, for, safety, and, watched, as, the, sea, receded, revealing, a, plain, of, mud, littered, with, lost, cargo, and, shipwrecks, approximately, 40, minutes, after, the, earthquake, a, tsunami, engulfed, the, harbor, and, downtown, area, rushing, up, the, tagus, river, so, fast, that, several, people, riding, on, horseback, were, forced, to, gallop, as, fast, as, possible, to, the, upper, grounds, for, fear, of, being, carried, away, it, was, followed, by, two, more, waves, candles, lit, in, homes, and, churches, all, around, the, city, for, all, saints, day, were, knocked, over, starting, a, fire, that, developed, into, a, firestorm, which, burned, for, hours, in, the, city, asphyxiating, people, up, to, 30, metres, 98, ft, from, the, blaze, lisbon, was, not, the, only, portuguese, city, affected, by, the, catastrophe, throughout, the, south, of, the, country, in, particular, the, algarve, destruction, was, rampant, the, tsunami, destroyed, some, coastal, fortresses, in, the, algarve, and, at, lower, levels, it, razed, several, houses, almost, all, the, coastal, towns, and, villages, of, the, algarve, were, heavily, damaged, except, faro, which, was, protected, by, the, sandy, banks, of, ria, formosa, in, lagos, the, waves, reached, the, top, of, the, city, walls, other, towns, in, different, portuguese, regions, such, as, peniche, cascais, set, bal, and, even, covilh, which, is, located, near, the, serra, da, estrela, mountain, range, in, central, inland, portugal, were, visibly, affected, by, the, earthquake, the, tsunami, or, both, the, shock, waves, of, the, earthquake, destroyed, part, of, covilh, s, castle, walls, and, its, large, towers, and, damaged, several, other, buildings, in, cova, da, beira, as, well, as, in, salamanca, spain, in, set, bal, parts, of, the, fort, of, s, o, filipe, de, set, bal, were, damaged, on, the, island, of, madeira, funchal, and, many, smaller, settlements, suffered, significant, damage, almost, all, of, the, ports, in, the, azores, archipelago, suffered, most, of, their, destruction, from, the, tsunami, with, the, sea, penetrating, about, 150, metres, 490, ft, inland, current, and, former, portuguese, towns, in, northern, africa, were, also, affected, by, the, earthquake, places, such, as, ceuta, ceded, by, portugal, to, spain, in, 1668, and, mazagon, where, the, tsunami, hit, hard, the, coastal, fortifications, of, both, towns, in, some, cases, going, over, it, and, flooding, the, harbor, area, were, affected, in, spain, the, tsunamis, swept, the, andalusian, atlantic, coast, damaging, the, city, of, cadiz, shocks, from, the, earthquake, were, felt, throughout, europe, as, far, as, finland, and, in, north, africa, and, according, to, some, sources, even, in, greenland, and, the, caribbean, tsunamis, as, tall, as, 20, metres, 66, ft, swept, along, the, coast, of, north, africa, and, struck, martinique, and, barbados, across, the, atlantic, ocean, a, three, metre, ten, foot, tsunami, hit, cornwall, on, the, southern, british, coast, galway, on, the, west, coast, of, ireland, was, also, hit, resulting, in, partial, destruction, of, the, spanish, arch, section, of, the, city, wall, in, county, clare, aughinish, island, was, created, when, a, low, lying, connection, to, the, mainland, was, washed, away, at, kinsale, several, vessels, were, whirled, round, in, the, harbor, and, water, poured, into, the, marketplace, in, 2015, it, was, determined, that, the, tsunami, waves, may, have, reached, the, coast, of, brazil, then, a, colony, of, portugal, letters, sent, by, brazilian, authorities, at, the, time, of, the, earthquake, describe, damage, and, destruction, caused, by, gigantic, waves, although, seismologists, and, geologists, have, always, agreed, that, the, epicenter, was, in, the, atlantic, to, the, west, of, the, iberian, peninsula, its, exact, location, has, been, a, subject, of, considerable, debate, early, hypotheses, had, proposed, the, gorringe, ridge, about, 320, km, 170, nmi, 200, mi, south, west, of, lisbon, until, simulations, showed, that, a, location, closer, to, the, shore, of, portugal, was, required, to, comply, with, the, observed, effects, of, the, tsunami, a, 1992, seismic, reflection, survey, of, the, ocean, floor, along, the, azores, gibraltar, transform, fault, detected, a, 50, kilometre, long, 31, mi, thrust, fault, southwest, of, cape, st, vincent, with, a, dip, slip, throw, of, more, than, 1, km, 0, 62, mi, this, structure, may, have, created, the, primary, tectonic, event, economic, historian, lvaro, pereira, estimated, that, of, lisbon, s, population, at, the, time, of, approximately, 200, 000, people, 30, 000, 40, 000, were, killed, another, 10, 000, may, have, died, in, morocco, a, 2009, study, of, contemporary, reports, relating, to, the, 1, november, event, found, them, vague, and, difficult, to, separate, from, reports, of, another, local, series, of, earthquakes, on, 18, 19, november, pereira, estimated, the, total, death, toll, in, portugal, spain, and, morocco, from, the, earthquake, and, the, resulting, fires, and, tsunami, at, 40, 000, to, 50, 000, people, eighty, five, percent, of, lisbon, s,

to, remind, lisboners, of, the, destruction, most, of, the, documentation, of, the, 1722, algarve, earthquake, sent, to, lisbon, for, archiving, became, lost, after, the, fire, that, followed, the, 1755, earthquake, the, royal, family, escaped, unharmed, from, the, catastrophe, king, joseph, i, of, portugal, and, the, court, had, left, the, city, after, attending, mass, at, sunrise, fulfilling, the, wish, of, one, of, the, king, s, daughters, to, spend, the, holiday, away, from, lisbon, after, the, catastrophe, joseph, i, developed, a, fear, of, living, within, walls, and, the, court, was, accommodated, in, a, huge, complex, of, tents, and, pavilions, in, the, hills, of, ajuda, then, on, the, outskirts, of, lisbon, the, king, s, claustrophobia, never, waned, and, it, was, only, after, joseph, s, death, that, his, daughter, maria, i, of, portugal, began, building, the, royal, ajuda, palace, which, still, stands, on, the, site, of, the, old, tented, camp, like, the, king, the, prime, minister, sebasti, o, de, melo, 1st, marquis, of, pombal, survived, the, earthquake, when, asked, what, was, to, be, done, pombal, reportedly, replied, bury, the, dead, and, heal, the, living, and, set, about, organizing, relief, and, rehabilitation, efforts, firefighters, were, sent, to, extinguish, the, raging, flames, and, teams, of, workers, and, ordinary, citizens, were, ordered, to, remove, the, thousands, of, corpses, before, disease, could, spread, contrary, to, custom, and, against, the, wishes, of, the, church, many, corpses, were, loaded, onto, barges, and, buried, at, sea,

looters, more, than, thirty, people, were, publicly, executed, the, army, prevented, many, able, bodied, citizens, from, fleeing, pressing, them, into, relief, and, reconstruction, work, a, project, proposed, that, a, new, royal, palace, be, built, in, campo, de, ourique, as, the, new, royal, residence, in, 1760, but, was, later, abandoned, due, to, a, lack, of, priority, or, interest, in, a, palace, being, built, in, the, campo, de, ourique, neighborhood, of, lisbon, the, king, and, the, prime, minister, immediately, launched, efforts, to, rebuild, the, city, on, december, 4, 1755, a, little, more, than, a, month, after, the, earthquake, manuel, da, maia, chief, engineer, to, the, realm, presented, his, plans, for, the, re, building, of, lisbon, maia, presented, four, options, from, abandoning, lisbon, to, building, a, completely, new, city, the, first, and, cheapest, plan, was, to, rebuild, the, old, city, using, recycled, materials, the, second, and, third, plans, proposed, widening, certain, streets, the, fourth, option, boldly, proposed, razing, the, entire, baixa, quarter, and, laying, out, new, streets, without, restraint, this, last, option, was, chosen, by, the, king, and, his, minister, in, less, than, a, year, the, city, was, cleared, of, debris, keen, to, have, a, new, and, perfectly, ordered, city, the, king, commissioned, the, construction, of, big, squares, rectilinear, large, avenues, and, widened, streets, the, new, mottos, of, lisbon, the, pombaline, buildings, are, among, the, earliest, seismically, protected, constructions, in, europe, small, wooden, models, were, built, for, testing, and, earthquakes, were, simulated, by, marching, troops, around, them, lisbon, s, new, lower, town, known, today, as, the, pombaline, lower, town, baixa, pombalina, is, one, of, the, city, s, famed, attractions, sections, of, other, portuguese, cities, such, as, the, vila, real, de, santo, ant, nio, in, algarve, were, also, rebuilt, along, pombaline, principles, the, casa, pia, a, portuguese, institution, founded, by, maria, i, known, as, a, pia, maria, the, pious, and, organized, by, police, intendant, pina, manique, in, 1780, was, founded, following, the, social, disarray, of, the, 1755, lisbon, earthquake, the, purpose, of, the, institution, was, to, provide, shelter, and, schooling, to, children, in, need, the, earthquake, had, wide, ranging, effects, on, the, lives, of, the, populace, and, intelligentsia, the, earthquake, had, struck, on, an, important, religious, holiday, and, had, destroyed, almost, every, important, church, in, the, city, causing, anxiety, and, confusion, amongst, the, citizens, of, a, staunch, and, devout, roman, catholic, country, theologians, and, philosophers, focused, and, speculated, on, the, religious, cause, and, message, seeing, the, earthquake, as, a, manifestation, of, divine, judgment, a, 2009, study, estimated, that, the, earthquake, cost, between, 32, and, 48, per, cent, of, portugal, s, gdp, also, in, spite, of, strict, controls, prices, and, wages, remained, volatile, in, the, years, after, the, tragedy, the, recovery, from, the, earthquake, also, led, to, a, rise, in, the, wage, premium, of, construction, workers, more, significantly, the, earthquake, became, an, opportunity, to, reform, the, economy, and, to, reduce, the, economic, semi, dependency, vis, vis, britain, the, earthquake, and, its, aftermath, strongly, influenced, the, intelligentsia, of, the, european, age, of, enlightenment, the, noted, writer, philosopher, voltaire, used, the, earthquake, in, candide, and, in, his, po, me, sur, le, d, sastre, de, lisbonne, poem, on, the, lisbon, disaster, voltaire, s, candide, attacks, the, notion, that, all, is, for, the, best, in, this, the, best, of, all, possible, worlds, a, world, closely, supervised, by, a, benevolent, deity, the, lisbon, disaster, provided, a, counterexample, for, voltaire, theodor, adorno, wrote, the, earthquake, of, lisbon, sufficed, to, cure, voltaire, of, the, theodicy, of, leibniz, negative, dialectics, 361, jean, jacques, rousseau, was, also, influenced, by, the, devastation, following, the, earthquake, whose, severity, he, believed, was, due, to, too, many, people, living, within, the, close, quarters, of, the, city, rousseau, used, the, earthquake, as, an, argument, against, cities, as, part, of, his, desire, for, a, more, naturalistic, way, of, life, immanuel, kant, published, three, separate, texts, in, 1756, on, the, lisbon, earthquake, as, a, younger, man, fascinated, with, the, earthquake, he, collected, all, the, information, available, in, news, pamphlets, and, formulated, a, theory, of, the, causes, of, earthquakes, kant, s, theory, which, involved, shifts, in, huge, caverns, filled, with, hot, gases, though, inaccurate, was, one, of, the, first, systematic, attempts, to, explain, earthquakes, in, natural, rather, than, supernatural, terms, according, to, walter, benjamin, kant, s, slim, early, book, on, the, earthquake, probably, represents, the, beginnings, of, scientific, geography, in, germany, and, certainly, the, beginnings, of, seismology, werner, hamacher, has, claimed, that, the, earthquake, s, consequences, extended, into, the, vocabulary, of, philosophy, making, the, common, metaphor, of, firm, grounding, for, philosophers, arguments, shaky, and, uncertain, under, the, impression, exerted, by, the, lisbon, earthquake, which, touched, the, european, mind, in, one, its, more, sensitive, epochs, the, metaphor, of, ground, and, tremor, completely, lost, their, apparent, innocence, they, were, no, longer, merely, figures, of, speech, 263, hamacher, claims, that, the, foundational, certainty, of, ren, descartes, philosophy, began, to, shake, following, the, lisbon, earthquake, the, earthquake, had, a, major, impact, on, politics, the, prime, minister, sebasti, o, jos, de, carvalho, e, melo, 1st, marquis, of, pombal, was, the, favourite, of, the, king, but, the, aristocracy, despised, him, as, an, upstart, son, of, a, country, squire, the, prime, minister, in, turn, disliked, the, old, nobles, whom, he, considered, corrupt, and, incapable, of, practical, action, before, 1, november, 1755, there, had, been, a, constant, struggle, for, power, and, royal, favour, but, the, competent, response, of, the, marquis, of, pombal, effectively, severed, the, power, of, the, old, aristocratic, factions, however, the, silent, opposition, and, resentment, of, king, joseph, i, began, to, rise, which, would, culminate, with, the, attempted, assassination, of, the, king, in, 1758, and, the, subsequent, elimination, of, the, powerful, duke, of, aveiro, and, the, t, vora, family, in, 1752, a, sebastianist, predicted, that, a, terrible, earthquake, would, destroy, lisbon, on, all, saints, day, after, the, 1755, lisbon, earthquake, struck, on, all, saints, day, there, was, a, surge, of, converts, to, sebastianism, the, prime, minister, s, response, was, not, limited, to, the, practicalities, of, reconstruction, he, ordered, a, query, sent, to, all, parishes, of, the, country, regarding, the, earthquake, and, its, effects, questions, included, the, following, the, answers, to, those, and, other, questions, are, still, archived, in, the, torre, do, tombo, the, national, historical, archive, studying, and, cross, referencing, the, priests, accounts, modern, scientists, were, able, to, reconstruct, the, event, from, a, scientific, perspective, without, the, questionnaire, designed, by, the, marquis, of, pombal, that, would, have, been, impossible, because, pombal, was, the, first, to, attempt, an, objective, scientific, description, of, the, broad, causes, and, consequences, of, an, earthquake, he, is, regarded, as, a, forerunner, of, modern, seismological, scientists, the, 18th, century, english, baroque, composer, richard, carter, composed, and, published, an, ode, on, the, earthquake, a, fictionalised, version, of, the, 1755, lisbon, earthquake, features, as, a, main, plot, element, of, the, 2014, video, game, assassin, s, creed, rogue, developed, and, published, by, ubisoft, notably, a, similar, earthquake, occurs, earlier, in, the, story, in, port, au, prince, haiti, and, possibly, coincides, with, a, real, world, earthquake, recorded, there, in, 1751, the, album, 1755, by, the, portuguese, gothic, metal, band, moonspell, is, a, concept, album, detailing, the, story, of, the, 1755, lisbon, earthquake, the, album, is, entirely, sung, in, portuguese, and, explores, not, only, the, history, but, also, its, effects, on, portuguese, society, culture, and, spirituality, the, lisbon, earthquake, is, vividly, depicted, in, avram, davidson, s, masters, of, the, maze, one, of, the, many, times, and, places, visited, by, the, book, s, time, traveling, protagonists, the, board, game, lisboa, was, created, in, 2017, by, vital, lacerda, and, focuses, on, the, reconstruction, of, lisbon, after, the, earthquake
