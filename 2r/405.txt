created, a, baltic, empire, centred, on, the, gulf, of, finland, and, comprising, the, provinces, of, karelia, ingria, estonia, and, livonia, during, the, thirty, years, war, sweden, gained, tracts, in, germany, as, well, including, western, pomerania, wismar, the, duchy, of, bremen, and, verden, during, the, same, period, sweden, conquered, danish, and, norwegian, provinces, north, of, the, sound, 1645, 1658, these, victories, may, be, ascribed, to, a, well, trained, army, which, despite, its, comparatively, small, size, was, far, more, professional, than, most, continental, armies, and, also, to, a, modernization, of, administration, both, civilian, and, military, in, the, course, of, the, 17th, century, which, enabled, the, monarchy, to, harness, the, resources, of, the, country, and, its, empire, effectively, fighting, in, the, field, the, swedish, army, which, during, the, thirty, years, war, contained, more, german, and, scottish, mercenaries, than, ethnic, swedes, but, was, administered, by, the, swedish, crown, was, able, in, particular, to, make, quick, sustained, marches, across, large, tracts, of, land, and, to, maintain, a, high, rate, of, small, arms, fire, due, to, proficient, military, drill, however, the, swedish, state, ultimately, proved, unable, to, support, and, maintain, its, army, in, a, prolonged, war, campaigns, on, the, continent, had, been, proposed, on, the, basis, that, the, army, would, be, financially, self, supporting, through, plunder, and, taxation, of, newly, gained, land, a, concept, shared, by, most, major, powers, of, the, period, the, cost, of, the, warfare, proved, to, be, much, higher, than, the, occupied, countries, could, fund, and, sweden, s, coffers, and, resources, in, manpower, were, eventually, drained, in, the, course, of, long, conflicts, the, foreign, interventions, in, russia, during, the, time, of, troubles, resulted, in, swedish, gains, in, the, treaty, of, stolbovo, 1617, the, treaty, deprived, russia, of, direct, access, to, the, baltic, sea, russian, fortunes, began, to, reverse, in, the, final, years, of, the, 17th, century, notably, with, the, rise, to, power, of, peter, the, great, who, looked, to, address, the, earlier, losses, and, re, establish, a, baltic, presence, in, the, late, 1690s, the, adventurer, johann, patkul, managed, to, ally, russia, with, denmark, and, saxony, by,

which, had, strengthened, the, monarch, s, status, and, the, empire, s, military, abilities, charles, xii, refrained, from, all, kinds, of, luxury, and, alcohol, and, usage, of, the, french, language, since, he, considered, these, things, decadent, and, superfluous, he, preferred, the, life, of, an, ordinary, soldier, on, horseback, not, that, of, contemporary, baroque, courts, he, determinedly, pursued, his, goal, of, dethroning, his, adversaries, whom, he, considered, unworthy, of, their, thrones, due, to, broken, promises, thereby, refusing, to, take, several, chances, to, make, peace, during, the, war, the, most, important, swedish, commanders, besides, charles, xii, were, his, close, friend, carl, gustav, rehnski, ld, also, magnus, stenbock, and, adam, ludwig, lewenhaupt, charles,

monarchy, were, not, realized, due, to, the, zealous, nature, of, the, polish, nobility, and, the, previously, initiated, laws, that, decreased, the, power, of, the, monarch, his, meeting, with, peter, the, great, in, rawa, ruska, in, september, 1698, where, the, plans, to, attack, sweden, were, made, became, legendary, for, its, decadence, frederick, iv, of, denmark, norway, another, cousin,

in, a, manner, similar, to, charles, xi, of, sweden, he, did, not, achieve, his, main, goal, to, regain, the, former, eastern, danish, provinces, lost, to, sweden, in, the, course, of, the, 17th, century, he, was, not, able, to, keep, northern, swedish, pomerania, danish, from, 1712, to, 1715, he, did, put, an, end, to, the, swedish, threat, south, of, denmark, he, ended, sweden, s, exemption,

this, point, as, augustus, started, the, war, as, an, elector, of, saxony, disregarding, polish, negotiation, proposals, supported, by, the, swedish, parliament, charles, crossed, into, the, commonwealth, and, decisively, defeated, the, saxe, polish, forces, in, the, battle, of, klissow, in, 1702, and, in, the, battle, of, pultusk, in, 1703, this, successful, invasion, enabled, charles, xii, to, dethrone, augustus, ii, and, coerce, the, polish, sejm, to, replace, him, with, stanislaus, leszczy, ski, in, 1704, august, ii, resisted, still, possessing, control, of, his, native, saxony, but, was, decisively, defeated, at, the, battle, of, fraustadt, in, 1706, a, battle, sometimes, compared, to, the, ancient, battle, of, cannae, due, to, the, swedish, forces, use, of, double, envelopment, with, a, deadly, result, for, the, saxon, army, in, 1706, after, a, swedish, invasion, of, saxony, august, ii, was, forced, to, sign, the, treaty, of, altranst, dt, in, which, he, made,

and, executed, by, breaking, on, the, wheel, in, 1707, an, incident, which, given, his, diplomatic, immunity, infuriated, opinion, against, the, swedish, king, who, was, then, expected, to, win, the, war, against, the, only, hostile, power, remaining, tsar, peter, s, russia, the, battle, of, narva, dealt, a, severe, setback, to, peter, the, great, but, the, shift, of, charles, xii, s, army, to, the, polish, saxon, threat, soon, afterward, provided, him, with, an, opportunity, to, regroup, and, regain, territory, in, the, baltic, provinces, russian, victories, at, erastfer, and, n, teborg, shlisselburg, provided, access, to, ingria, in, 1703, where, peter, captured, the, swedish, fortress, of, nyen, guarding, the, mouth, of, the, river, neva, thanks, to, general, adam, ludwig, lewenhaupt, whose, outnumbered, forces, fended, the, russians, off, in, the, battles, of, gem, uerthof, and, jakobstadt, sweden, was, able, to, maintain, control, of, most, of, its, baltic, provinces, before, going, to, war, peter, had, made, preparations, for, a, navy, and, a, modern, style, army, based, primarily, on, infantry, drilled, in, the, use, of, firearms, the, nyen, fortress, was, soon, abandoned, and, demolished, by, peter, who, built, nearby, a, superior, fortress, as, a, beginning, to, the, city, of, saint, petersburg, by, 1704, other, fortresses, were, situated, on, the, island, of, kotlin, and, the, sand, flats, to, its, south, these, became, known, as, kronstadt, and, kronslot, the, swedes, attempted, a, raid, on, the, neva, fort, on, 13, july, 1704, with, ships, and, landing, armies, but, the, russian, fortifications, held, in, 1705, repeated, swedish, attacks, were, made, against, russian, fortifications, in, the, area, to, little, effect, a, major, attack, on, 15, july, 1705, ended, in, the, deaths, of, more, than, 500, swedish, men, or, a, third, of, its, forces, in, view, of, continued, failure, to, check, russian, consolidation, and, with, declining, manpower, sweden, opted, to, blockade, saint, petersburg, in, 1705, in, the, summer, of, 1706, swedish, general, georg, johan, maidel, crossed, the, neva, with, 4, 000, troops, and, defeated, an, opposing, russian, force, but, made, no, move, on, saint, petersburg, later, in, the, autumn, peter, i, led, an, army, of, 20, 000, men, in, an, attempt, to, take, the, swedish, town, and, fortress, of, viborg, however, bad, roads, proved, impassable, to, his, heavy, siege, guns, the, troops, who, arrived, on, 12, october, therefore, had, to, abandon, the, siege, after, only, a, few, days, on, 12, may, 1708, a, russian, galley, fleet, made, a, lightning, raid, on, borg, and, managed, to, return, to, kronslot, just, one, day, before, the, swedish, battle, fleet, returned, to, the, blockade, after, being, delayed, by, unfavourable, winds, in, august, 1708, a, swedish, army, of, 12, 000, men, under, general, georg, henrik, lybecker, attacked, ingria, crossing, the, neva, from, the, north, they, met, stubborn, resistance, ran, out, of, supplies, and, after, reaching, the, gulf, of, finland, west, of, kronstadt, had, to, be, evacuated, by, sea, between, 10, and, 17, october, over, 11, 000, men, were, evacuated, but, more, than, 5000, horses, were, slaughtered, which, crippled, the, mobility, and, offensive, capability, of, the, swedish, army, in, finland, for, several, years, peter, i, took, advantage, of, this, by, redeploying, a, large, number, of, men, from, ingria, to, ukraine, charles, spent, the, years, 1702, 06, in, a, prolonged, struggle, with, augustus, ii, the, strong, he, had, already, inflicted, defeat, on, him, at, riga, in, june, 1701, and, took, warsaw, the, following, year, but, trying, to, force, a, decisive, defeat, proved, elusive, russia, left, poland, in, the, spring, of, 1706, abandoning, artillery, but, escaping, from, the, pursuing, swedes, who, stopped, at, pinsk, charles, wanted, not, just, to, defeat, the, commonwealth, army, but, to, depose, augustus, whom, he, regarded, as, especially, treasonous, and, have, him, replaced, with, someone, who, would, be, a, swedish, ally, though, this, proved, hard, to, achieve, after, years, of, marches, and, fighting, around, poland, he, finally, had, to, invade, augustus, hereditary, saxony, to, take, him, out, of, the, war, in, the, treaty, of, altranst, dt, 1706, augustus, was, finally, forced, to, step, down, from, the, polish, throne, but, charles, had, already, lost, the, valuable, advantage, of, time, over, his, main, enemy, in, the, east, peter, i, who, then, had, the, time, to, recover, and, build, up, an, army, that, was, both, new, and, better, at, this, point, in, 1707, peter, offered, to, return, everything, he, had, so, far, occupied, essentially, ingria, except, saint, petersburg, and, the, line, of, the, neva, to, avoid, a, full, scale, war, but, charles, xii, refused, instead, he, initiated, a, march, from, saxony, to, invade, russia, though, his, primary, goal, was, moscow, the, strength, of, his, forces, was, sapped, by, the, cold, weather, the, winter, of, 1708, 09, being, one, of, the, most, severe, in, modern, european, history, and, peter, s, use, of, scorched, earth, tactics, when, the, main, army, turned, south, to, recover, in, ukraine, the, second, army, with, supplies, and, reinforcements, was, intercepted, and, routed, at, lesnaya, and, so, were, the, supplies, and, reinforcements, of, swedish, ally, ivan, mazepa, in, baturyn, charles, was, crushingly, defeated, by, a, larger, russian, force, under, peter, in, the, battle, of, poltava, and, fled, to, the, ottoman, empire, while, the, remains, of, his, army, surrendered, at, perevolochna, this, shattering, defeat, in, 1709, did, not, end, the, war, although, it, decided, it, denmark, and, saxony, joined, the, war, again, and, augustus, the, strong, through, the, politics, of, boris, kurakin, regained, the, polish, throne, peter, continued, his, campaigns, in, the, baltics, and, eventually, he, built, up, a, powerful, navy, in, 1710, the, russian, forces, captured, riga, at, the, time, the, most, populated, city, in, the, swedish, realm, and, tallinn, evicting, the, swedes, from, the, baltic, provinces, now, integrated, in, the, russian, tsardom, by, the, capitulation, of, estonia, and, livonia, after, poltava, peter, the, great, and, augustus, the, strong, allied, again, in, the, treaty, of, thorn, 1709, frederick, iv, of, denmark, norway, with, augustus, the, strong, in, the, treaty, of, dresden, 1709, and, russia, with, denmark, norway, in, the, subsequent, treaty, of, copenhagen, in, the, treaty, of, hanover, 1710, hanover, whose, elector, was, to, become, george, i, of, great, britain, allied, with, russia, in, 1713, brandenburg, prussia, allied, with,

with, brandenburg, prussia, and, the, treaty, of, greifswald, with, russia, when, his, army, surrendered, charles, xii, of, sweden, and, a, few, soldiers, escaped, to, ottoman, territory, founding, a, colony, in, front, of, bender, moldova, peter, i, demanded, charles, s, eviction, and, when, the, sultan, refused, peter, decided, to, force, it, by, invading, the, ottoman, empire, the, ensuing, pruth, river, campaign, resulted, in, a, disaster, for, the, russians, as, peter, s, army, was, trapped, by, an, ottoman, army, at, the, pruth, river, however, peter, managed, to, negotiate, a, retreat, making, a, few, territorial, concessions, and, promising, to, withdraw, his, forces, from, the, holy, roman, empire, as, well, as, allowing, charles, s, return, to, sweden, these, terms, were, laid, out, in, the, treaty, of, adrianople, 1713, charles, showed, no, interest, in, returning, established, a, provisional, court, in, his, colony, and, sought, to, persuade, the, sultan, to, engage, in, an, ottoman, swedish, assault, on, russia, the, sultan, put, an, end, to, the, generous, hospitality, granted, and, had, the, king, arrested, in, what, became, known, as, the, kalabalik, in, 1713, charles, was, then, confined, at, timurtash, and, demotika, later, he, abandoned, his, hopes, for, an, ottoman, front, and, returned, to, sweden, in, a, 14, day, ride, the, war, between, russia, and, sweden, continued, after, the, disaster, of, poltava, in, 1709, though, the, shattered, swedish, continental, army, could, provide, very, little, help, russia, captured, viborg, in, 1710, and, successfully, held, it, against, swedish, attempts, to, retake, the, town, in, 1711, in, 1712, the, first, russian, campaign, to, capture, finland, began, under, the, command, of, general, admiral, fyodor, apraksin, apraksin, gathered, an, army, of, 15, 000, men, at, viborg, and, started, the, operation, in, late, august, swedish, general, georg, henrik, lybecker, chose, not, to, face, the, russians, with, his, 7, 500, men, in, the, prepared, positions, close, to, viborg, and, instead, withdrew, west, of, kymijoki, river, using, scorched, earth, tactics, apraksin, s, forces, reached, the, river, but, chose, not, to, cross, it, and, instead, withdrew, back, to, viborg, likely, due, to, problems, in, supply, swedish, efforts, to, maintain, their, defences, were, greatly, hampered, by, the, drain, of, manpower, by, the, continental, army, and, various, garrisons, around, the, baltic, sea, as, well, as, by, the, plague, outbreak, that, struck, finland, and, sweden, between, 1710, and, 1713, which, devastated, the, land, killing, amongst, others, over, half, of, the, population, of, helsingfors, helsinki, after, the, failure, of, 1712, peter, the, great, ordered, that, further, campaigns, in, war, ravaged, regions, of, finland, with, poor, transportation, networks, were, to, be, performed, along, the, coastline, and, the, seaways, near, the, coast, alarmed, by, the, russian, preparations, lybecker, requested, naval, units, to, be, brought, in, as, soon, as, possible, in, the, spring, of, 1713, however, like, so, often, swedish, naval, units, arrived, only, after, the, initial, russian, spring, campaign, had, ended, nominally, under, the, command, of, apraksin, but, accompanied, by, peter, the, great, a, fleet, of, coastal, ships, together, with, 12, 000, men, infantry, and, artillery, began, the, campaign, by, sailing, from, kronstadt, on, 2, may, 1713, a, further, 4, 000, cavalry, were, later, sent, overland, to, join, with, the, army, the, fleet, had, already, arrived, at, helsinki, on, 8, may, and, were, met, by, 1, 800, swedish, infantry, under, general, carl, gustaf, armfeldt, which, started, the, battle, of, helsinki, together, with, rowers, from, the, ships, the, russians, had, 20, 000, men, at, their, disposal, even, without, the, cavalry, the, defenders, however, managed, to, fend, off, landing, attempts, by, the, attackers, until, the, russians, landed, at, their, flank, at, sandviken, which, forced, armfelt, to, retire, towards, porvoo, borg, after, setting, afire, both, the, town, and, all, the, supplies, stored, there, as, well, as, bridges, leading, north, from, the, town, it, was, only, on, 12, may, that, a, swedish, squadron, under, admiral, erik, johan, lillie, made, it, to, helsinki, but, there, was, nothing, it, could, do, the, bulk, of, the, russian, forces, moved, along, the, coast, towards, borg, and, the, forces, of, lybecker, whom, armfelt, had, joined, on, 21, 22, may, 1713, a, russian, force, of, 10, 000, men, landed, at, pern, pernaja, and, constructed, fortifications, there, large, stores, of, supplies, and, munitions, were, transported, from, viborg, and, saint, petersburg, to, the, new, base, of, operations, russian, cavalry, managed, to, link, up, with, the, rest, of, the, army, there, as, well, lybecker, s, army, of, 7000, infantry, and, 3000, cavalry, avoided, contact, with, the, russians, and, instead, kept, withdrawing, further, inland, without, even, contesting, the, control, of, borg, region, or, the, important, coastal, road, between, helsinki, helsingfors, and, turku, bo, this, also, severed, the, contact, between, swedish, fleet, and, ground, forces, and, prevented, swedish, naval, units, from, supplying, it, soldiers, in, the, swedish, army, who, were, mostly, finnish, resented, being, repeatedly, ordered, to, withdraw, without, even, seeing, the, enemy, lybecker, was, soon, recalled, to, stockholm, for, a, hearing, and, armfelt, was, ordered, to, the, command, of, the, army, under, his, command, the, swedish, army, in, finland, stopped, to, engage, the, advancing, russians, at, p, lk, ne, in, october, 1713, where, a, russian, flanking, manoeuvre, forced, him, to, withdraw, to, avoid, getting, encircled, the, armies, met, again, later, at, napue, in, february, 1714, where, the, russians, won, a, decisive, victory, in, 1714, far, greater, swedish, naval, assets, were, diverted, towards, finland, which, managed, to, cut, the, coastal, sea, route, past, hang, cape, already, in, early, may, 1714, this, caused, severe, trouble, for, russian, supply, route, to, turku, and, beyond, as, supplies, had, to, be, carried, overland, the, russian, galley, fleet, arrived, to, the, area, on, 29, june, but, stayed, idle, until, 26, 27, july, when, under, the, leadership, of, peter, russian, galleys, managed, to, run, the, blockade, making, use, of, calm, weather, which, immobilized, the, swedish, battlefleet, while, losing, only, one, galley, of, roughly, 100, a, small, hastily, assembled, swedish, coastal, squadron, met, the, russian, galley, fleet, west, of, hang, cape, in, the, battle, of, gangut, and, was, overpowered, by, the, russians, who, had, nearly, ten, fold, superiority, the, russian, breach, of, the, blockade, at, hang, forced, the, swedish, fleet, to, withdraw, to, prevent, the, russian, fleet, from, reaching, sweden, itself, the, russian, army, occupied, finland, mostly, in, 1713, 1714, capturing, land, from, where, the, population, had, already, fled, to, sweden, on, 13, august, 1714, since, the, russian, galley, fleet, was, not, able, to, raid, the, swedish, coast, with, the, exception, of, ume, which, was, plundered, on, 18, september, the, fleet, instead, supported, the, advance, of, the, russian, army, which, led, to, hastily, withdrawal, by, the, swedish, army, from, raahe, brahestad, to, tornio, torne, the, brutal, occupation, period, of, finland, in, 1714, 1721, is, known, as, the, great, wrath, in, 1710, the, swedish, army, in, poland, retreated, to, swedish, pomerania, pursued, by, the, coalition, in, 1711, siege, was, laid, to, stralsund, yet, the, town, could, not, be, taken, due, to, the, arrival, of, a, swedish, relief, army, led, by, general, magnus, stenbock, which, secured, the, pomeranian, pocket, before, turning, west, to, defeat, an, allied, army, in, the, battle, of, gadebusch, pursued, by, coalition, forces, stenbock, and, his, army, was, trapped, and, surrendered, during, the, siege, of, t, nning, in, 1714, charles, xii, returned, from, the, ottoman, empire, arriving, in, stralsund, in, november, in, nearby, greifswald, already, lost, to, sweden, russian, tsar, peter, the, great, and, british, king, george, i, in, his, position, as, elector, of, hanover, had, just, signed, an, alliance, on, 17, os, 28, ns, october, previously, a, formally, neutral, party, in, the, pomeranian, campaigns, brandenburg, prussia, openly, joined, the, coalition, by, declaring, war, on, sweden, in, the, summer, of, 1715, charles, was, then, at, war, with, much, of, northern, europe, and, stralsund, was, doomed, charles, remained, there, until, december, 1715, escaping, only, days, before, stralsund, fell, when, wismar, surrendered, in, 1716, all, of, sweden, s, baltic, and, german, possessions, were, lost, after, charles, xii, had, returned, from, the, ottoman, empire, and, resumed, personal, control, of, the, war, effort, he, initiated, two, norwegian, campaigns, starting, in, february, 1716, to, force, denmark, norway, into, a, separate, peace, treaty, furthermore, he, attempted, to, bar, great, britain, access, to, the, baltic, sea, in, search, for, allies, charles, xii, also, negotiated, with, the, british, jacobite, party, this, resulted, in, great, britain, declaring, war, on, sweden, in, 1717, the, norwegian, campaigns, were, halted, and, the, army, withdrawn, when, charles, xii, was, shot, dead, while, besieging, norwegian, fredriksten, on, 30, november, 1718, os, he, was, succeeded, by, his, sister, ulrika, eleonora, after, the, death, of, charles, xii, sweden, still, refused, to, make, peace, with, russia, on, peter, s, terms, despite, a, continued, swedish, naval, presence, and, strong, patrols, to, protect, the, coast, small, russian, raids, took, place, in, 1716, at, regrund, while, in, july, 1717, a, russian, squadron, landed, troops, at, gotland, who, raided, for, supplies, to, place, pressure, on, sweden, russia, sent, a, large, fleet, to, the, swedish, east, coast, in, july, 1719, there, under, protection, of, the, russian, battlefleet, the, russian, galley, fleet, was, split, into, three, groups, one, group, headed, for, the, coast, of, uppland, the, second, to, the, vicinity, of, stockholm, and, the, last, to, coast, of, s, dermanland, together, they, carried, a, landing, force, of, nearly, 30, 000, men, raiding, continued, for, a, month, and, devastated, amongst, others, the, towns, of, norrt, lje, s, dert, lje, nyk, ping, and, norrk, ping, and, almost, all, the, buildings, in, the, archipelago, of, stockholm, were, burned, a, smaller, russian, force, advanced, on, the, swedish, capital, but, was, stopped, at, the, battle, of, st, ket, on, 13, august, swedish, and, british, fleets, now, allied, with, sweden, sailed, from, the, west, coast, of, sweden, but, failed, to, catch, the, raiders, after, the, treaty, of, frederiksborg, in, early, 1720, sweden, was, no, longer, at, war, with, denmark, which, allowed, more, forces, to, be, placed, against, the, russians, this, did, not, prevent, russian, galleys, from, raiding, the, town, of, ume, once, again, later, in, july, 1720, a, squadron, from, the, swedish, battlefleet, engaged, the, russian, galley, fleet, in, the, battle, of, grengam, while, the, result, of, the, battle, is, contested, it, ended, russian, galley, raids, in, 1720, as, negotiations, for, peace, did, not, progress, the, russian, galleys, were, once, again, sent, to, raid, the, swedish, coast, in, 1721, targeting, primarily, the, swedish, coast, between, g, vle, and, pite, by, the, time, of, charles, xii, s, death, the, anti, swedish, allies, became, increasingly, divided, on, how, to, fill, the, power, gap, left, behind, by, the, defeated, and, retreating, swedish, armies, george, i, and, frederik, iv, both, coveted, hegemony, in, northern, germany, while, augustus, the, strong, was, concerned, about, the, ambitions, of, frederick, william, i, on, the, southeastern, baltic, coast, peter, the, great, whose, forces, were, spread, all, around, the, baltic, sea, envisioned, hegemony, in, east, central, europe, and, sought, to, establish, naval, bases, as, far, west, as, mecklenburg, in, january, 1719, george, i, augustus, and, emperor, charles, vi, concluded, a, treaty, in, vienna, aimed, at, reducing, russia, s, frontiers, to, the, pre, war, limits, hanover, great, britain, and, brandenburg, prussia, thereupon, negotiated, separate, peace, treaties, with, sweden, the, treaties, of, stockholm, in, 1719, and, early, 1720, which, partitioned, sweden, s, northern, german, dominions, among, the, parties, the, negotiations, were, mediated, by, french, diplomats, who, sought, to, prevent, a, complete, collapse, of, sweden, s, position, on, the, southern, baltic, coast, and, assured, that, sweden, was, to, retain, wismar, and, northern, swedish, pomerania, hanover, gained, swedish, bremen, verden, while, brandenburg, prussia, incorporated, southern, swedish, pomerania, britain, would, briefly, switch, sides, and, supported, sweden, before, leaving, the, war, in, addition, to, the, rivalries, in, the, anti, swedish, coalition, there, was, an, inner, swedish, rivalry, between, charles, frederick, duke, of, holstein, gottorp, and, frederick, i, of, hesse, cassel, for, the, swedish, throne, the, gottorp, party, succumbed, and, ulrike, eleonora, wife, of, frederick, i, transferred, power, to, her, husband, in, may, 1720, when, peace, was, concluded, with, denmark, the, anti, swedish, coalition, had, already, fallen, apart, and, denmark, was, not, in, a, military, position, to, negotiate, a, return, of, its, former, eastern, provinces, across, the, sound, frederick, i, was, however, willing, to, cede, swedish, support, for, his, rival, in, holstein, gottorp, which, came, under, danish, control, with, its, northern, part, annexed, and, furthermore, cede, the, swedish, privilege, of, exemption, from, the, sound, dues, a, respective, treaty, was, concluded, in, frederiksborg, in, june, 1720, when, sweden, finally, was, at, peace, with, hanover, great, britain, brandenburg, prussia, and, denmark, norway, it, hoped, that, the, anti, russian, sentiments, of, the, vienna, parties, and, france, would, culminate, in, an, alliance, that, would, restore, its, russian, occupied, eastern, provinces, yet, primarily, due, to, internal, conflicts, in, great, britain, and, france, that, did, not, happen, therefore, the, war, was, finally, concluded, by, the, treaty, of, nystad, between, russia, and, sweden, in, uusikaupunki, nystad, on, 30, august, 1721, os, finland, was, returned, to, sweden, while, the, majority, of, russia, s, conquests, swedish, estonia, livonia, ingria, kexholm, and, a, portion, of, karelia, were, ceded, to, the, tsardom, sweden, s, dissatisfaction, with, the, result, led, to, fruitless, attempts, at, recovering, the, lost, territories, in, the, course, of, the, following, century, such, as, the, russo, swedish, war, of, 1741, 1743, and, the, russo, swedish, war, of, 1788, 1790, saxe, poland, lithuania, and, sweden, did, not, conclude, a, formal, peace, treaty, instead, they, renewed, the, peace, of, oliva, that, had, ended, the, second, northern, war, in, 1660, sweden, had, lost, almost, all, of, its, overseas, holdings, gained, in, the, 17th, century, and, ceased, to, be, a, major, power, russia, gained, its, baltic, territories, and, became, one, of, the, greatest, powers, in, europe
