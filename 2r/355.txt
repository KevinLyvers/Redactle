family, or, lineage, the, family, was, the, basic, political, unit, in, the, empire, the, family, or, lineage, followed, the, village, organization, which, was, headed, by, the, odikro, all, villages, were, then, grouped, together, to, form, divisions, headed, by, a, divisional, head, called, ohene, the, various, divisions, were, politically, grouped, to, form, a, state, which, was, headed, by, an, omanhene, or, amanhene, finally, all, asante, states, formed, the, asante, empire, with, the, asantehene, as, their, king, the, asante, government, was, built, upon, a, sophisticated, bureaucracy, in, kumasi, with, separate, ministries, to, handle, the, state, s, affairs, of, particular, note, was, asante, s, foreign, office, based, in, kumasi, despite, its, small, size, it, allowed, the, state, to, pursue, complex, negotiations, with, foreign, powers, the, office, was, divided, into, departments, to, handle, relations, separately, with, the, british, french, dutch, and, arabs, scholars, of, ashanti, history, such, as, larry, yarak, and, ivor, wilks, disagree, over, the, power, of, this, sophisticated, bureaucracy, in, comparison, to, the, asantehene, but, agree, that, it, was, a, sign, of, a, highly, developed, government, with, a, complex, system, of, checks, and, balances, at, the, top, of, asante, s, power, structure, sat, the, asantehene, the, king, of, asante, each, asantahene, was, enthroned, on, the, sacred, golden, stool, the, sika, dwa, an, object, that, came, to, symbolise, the, very, power, of, the, king, osei, kwadwo, r, 1764, 1777, began, the, meritocratic, system, of, appointing, central, officials, according, to, their, ability, rather, than, their, birth, as, king, the, asantehene, held, immense, power, in, asante, but, did, not, enjoy, absolute, royal, rule, he, was, obliged, to, share, considerable, legislative, and, executive, powers, with, asante, s, sophisticated, bureaucracy, but, the, asantehene, was, the, only, person, in, asante, permitted, to, invoke, the, death, sentence, in, cases, of, crime, during, wartime, the, king, acted, as, supreme, commander, of, the, asante, army, although, during, the, 19th, century, the, fighting, was, increasingly, handled, by, the, ministry, of, war, in, kumasi, each, member, of, the, confederacy, was, also, obliged, to, send, annual, tribute, to, kumasi, the, asantehene, king, of, all, asante, reigned, over, all, and, was, king, of, the, division, of, kumasi, the, nation, s, capital, and, the, asante, empire, he, was, elected, in, the, same, manner, as, all, other, chiefs, in, this, hierarchical, structure, every, chief, or, king, swore, fealty, to, the, one, above, him, from, village, and, subdivision, to, division, to, the, chief, of, kumasi, and, finally, the, asantehene, swore, fealty, to, the, state, the, elders, circumscribed, the, power, of, the, asantehene, and, the, chiefs, of, other, divisions, considerably, checked, the, power, of, the, king, this, in, practical, effect, created, a, system, of, checks, and, balances, as, the, symbol, of, the, nation, the, asantehene, received, significant, deference, ritually, for, the, context, was, religious, in, that, he, was, a, symbol, of, the, people, in, the, flesh, the, living, dead, or, yet, to, be, born, when, the, king, committed, an, act, not, approved, of, by, the, counsel, of, elders, or, the, people, he, could, possibly, be, impeached, and, demoted, to, a, commoner, the, existence, of, aristocratic, organizations, and, the, council, of, elders, is, evidence, of, an, oligarchic, tendency, in, asante, political, life, though, older, men, tended, to, monopolize, political, power, asante, instituted, an, organization, of, young, men, the, nmerante, that, tended, to, democratize, and, liberalize, the, political, process, in, the, empire, the, council, of, elders, undertook, actions, only, after, consulting, a, representative, of, the, nmerante, their, views, were, taken, seriously, as, they, participated, in, decision, making, in, the, empire, the, current, residence, of, the, asantehene, is, the, manhyia, palace, built, in, 1925, by, the, british, and, presented, to, the,

with, clay, and, thatched, with, sheaves, of, leaves, the, surviving, designated, sites, are, shrines, but, there, have, been, many, other, buildings, in, the, past, with, the, same, architectural,

leaders, generally, houses, whether, designed, for, human, habitation, or, for, the, deities, consisted, of, four, separate, rectangular, single, room, buildings, set, around, an, open, courtyard, the, inner, corners, of, adjacent, buildings, were, linked, by, means, of, splayed, screen, walls, whose, sides, and, angles, could, be, adapted, to, allow, for, any, inaccuracy, in, the, initial, layout, typically, three, of, the, buildings, were, completely, open, to, the, courtyard, while, the, fourth, was, partially, enclosed, either, by, the, door, and, windows, or, by, open, work, screens, flanking, an, opening, infrastructure, such, as, road, transport, and, communication, throughout, the, empire, was, maintained, via, a, network, of, well, kept, roads, from, the, asante,

were, flushed, with, gallons, of, boiling, water, bowdich, revealed, in, his, 1817, account, that, all, streets, of, kumasi, were, named, stationed, at, various, points, of, asante, roads, were, the, nkwansrafo, or, road, wardens, who, served, as, the, highway, police, checking, the, movement, of, traders, and, strangers, on, all, roads, they, were, also, responsible, for, scouting, and, were, charged, with, the, collection, of, tolls, from, traders, in, the, early, 19th, century, larger, rivers, were, either, forded, in, the, dry, season, or, crossed, by, canoe, or, line, and, raft,

response, to, the, delivery, of, a, carriage, by, thomas, freeman, in, 1841, the, asante, empire, began, to, build, bridges, across, water, bodies, for, transport, that, year, asantehene, kwaku, dua, ordered, proper, bridges, to, be, built, across, streams, in, the, metropolitan, area, of, kumase, thomas, freeman, described, the, construction, as, some, stout, forked, sticks, or, posts, are, driven, in, the, centre, of, the, stream, at, convenient, distances, across, which, are, placed, some, strong, beams, fastened, to, the, posts, with, withes, from, the, numerous, climbing, plants, on, every, hand, on, these, bearers, are, placed, long, stout, poles, which, are, covered, with, earth, from, fourth, to, six, inches, thick, the, asantehene, inherited, his, position, from, his, queen, mother, and, he, was, assisted, at, the, capital, kumasi, by, a, civil, service, of, men, talented, in, trade, diplomacy, and, the, military, with, a, head, called, the, gyaasehene, men, from, the, arabian, peninsula, sudan, and, europe, were, employed, in, the, asante, empire, civil, service, all, of, whom, were, appointed, by, the, asantehene, in, the, metropolitan, areas, of, asante, several, police, forces, were, responsible, for, maintaining, law, and, order, in, kumasi, a, uniformed, police, who, were, distinguished, by, their, long, hair, maintained, order, by, ensuring, no, one, else, entered, and, left, the, city, without, permission, from, the, government, the, ankobia, or, special, police, were, used, as, the, empire, s, special, forces, and, bodyguards, to, the, asantehene, as, sources, of, intelligence, and, to, suppress, rebellion, for, most, of, the, 19th, century, and, into, the, 20th, century, the, asante, sovereign, state, remained, powerful, the, asante, armies, served, the, empire, well, supporting, its, long, period, of, expansion, and, subsequent, resistance, to, european, colonization, armament, was, primarily, with, firearms, but, some, historians, hold, that, indigenous, organization, and, leadership, probably, played, a, more, crucial, role, in, asante, successes, these, are, perhaps, more, significant, when, considering, that, the, asante, had, numerous, troops, from, conquered, or, incorporated, peoples, and, faced, a, number, of, revolts, and, rebellions, from, these, peoples, over, its, long, history, the, political, genius, of, the, symbolic, golden, stool, and, the, fusing, effect, of, a, national, army, however, provided, the, unity, needed, to, keep, the, empire, viable, total, potential, strength, was, some, 80, 000, to, 200, 000, making, the, asante, army, bigger, than, the, well, known, zulu, and, comparable, to, possibly, africa, s, largest, the, legions, of, ethiopia, the, asante, army, was, described, as, a, fiercely, organized, one, whose, king, could, bring, 200, 000, men, into, the, field, and, whose, warriors, were, evidently, not, cowed, by, snider, rifles, and, 7, pounder, guns, while, actual, forces, deployed, in, the, field, were, less, than, potential, strength, tens, of, thousands, of, soldiers, were, usually, available, to, serve, the, needs, of, the, empire, mobilization, depended, on, small, cadres, of, regulars, who, guided, and, directed, levees, and, contingents, called, up, from, provincial, governors, organization, was, structured, around, an, advance, guard, main, body, rear, guard, and, two, right, and, left, wing, flanking, elements, this, provided, flexibility, in, the, forest, country, the, asante, armies, typically, operated, in, horses, were, known, to, survive, in, kumasi, but, because, they, could, not, survive, in, the, tsetse, fly, infested, forest, zone, in, the, south, there, was, no, cavalry, asante, high, ranking, officers, rode, horses, with, the, hauteur, of, european, officers, but, they, did, not, ride, to, battle, the, approach, to, the, battlefield, was, typically, via, converging, columns, and, tactics, included, ambushes, and, extensive, maneuvers, on, the, wings, unique, among, african, armies, the, asante, deployed, medical, units, to, support, their, fighters, this, force, was, to, expand, the, empire, substantially, and, continually, for, over, a, century, and, defeated, the, british, in, several, encounters, brass, barrel, blunderbuss, were, produced, in, some, states, in, the, gold, coast, including, the, asante, empire, around, the, eighteenth, and, nineteenth, centuries, various, accounts, indicate, that, asante, blacksmiths, were, not, only, able, to, repair, firearms, but, that, barrels, locks, and, stocks, were, on, occasion, remade, from, 1806, until, 1896, the, asante, state, was, in, a, perpetual, state, of, war, involving, expansion, or, defense, of, its, domain, asante, exploits, against, other, african, forces, made, it, the, paramount, power, in, the, region, its, impressive, performance, against, the, british, also, earned, it, the, respect, of, european, powers, in, 1806, the, asante, pursued, two, rebel, leaders, through, fante, territory, to, the, coast, the, british, refusal, to, surrender, the, rebels, led, to, an, asante, attack, this, was, devastating, enough, that, the, british, handed, over, a, rebel, the, other, escaped, in, 1807, disputes, with, the, fante, led, to, the, ashanti, fante, war, in, which, the, asante, were, victorious, under, asantehene, osei, bonsu, bonsu, the, whale, in,

alliance, in, open, combat, pushing, their, enemies, towards, the, akwapim, hills, asante, however, abandoned, their, campaign, of, pursuit, after, capturing, a, british, fort, and, establishing, their, presence, and, authority, on, the, coast, in, 1814, the, asante, launched, an, invasion, of, the, gold, coast, largely, to, gain, access, to, european, traders, in, the, ashanti, akim, akwapim,

was, established, from, the, midlands, down, to, the, coast, the, first, of, the, anglo, ashanti, wars, occurred, in, 1823, in, these, conflicts, the, asante, empire, faced, off, with, varying, degrees, of, success, against, the, british, empire, residing, on, the, coast, the, root, of, the, conflict, traces, back, to, 1823, when, sir, charles, maccarthy, resisting, all, overtures, by, the, asante, to, negotiate, led, an, invading, force, the, asante, defeated, this, killed, maccarthy, took, his, head, for, a, trophy, and, swept, on, to, the, coast, however, disease, forced, them, back, the, asante, were, so, successful, in, subsequent, fighting, that, in, 1826, they, again, moved, on, the, coast, the, asante, were, stopped, about, 15, kilometres, 10, mi, north, of, accra, by, a, british, led, force, they, fought, against, superior, numbers, of, british, allied, forces, including, denkyirans, until, the, novelty, of, british, rockets, caused, the, asante, army, to, flee, in, 1831, a, treaty, led, to, 30, years, of, peace, with, the, pra, river, accepted, as, the, border, with, the, exception, of, a, few, asante, light, skirmishes, across, the, pra, in, 1853, and, 1854, the, peace, between, the, asante, and, british, empire, had, remained, unbroken, for, over, 30, years, then, in, 1863, a, large, asante, delegation, crossed, the, river, pursuing, a, fugitive, kwesi,
