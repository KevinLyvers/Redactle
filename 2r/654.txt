astronomy, is, the, oldest, of, the, natural, sciences, dating, back, to, antiquity, with, its, origins, in, the, religious, mythological, cosmological, calendrical, and, astrological, beliefs, and, practices, of, prehistory, vestiges, of, these, are, still, found, in, astrology, a, discipline, long, interwoven, with, public, and, governmental, astronomy, it, was, not, completely, separated, in, europe, see, astrology, and, astronomy, during, the, copernican, revolution, starting, in, 1543, in, some, cultures, astronomical, data, was, used, for, astrological, prognostication, early, cultures, identified, celestial, objects, with, gods, and, spirits, they, related, these, objects, and, their, movements, to, phenomena, such, as, rain, drought, seasons, and, tides, it, is, generally, believed, that, the, first, astronomers, were, priests, and, that, they, understood, celestial, objects, and, events, to, be, manifestations, of, the, divine, hence, early, astronomy, s, connection, to, what, is, now, called, astrology, a, 32, 500, year, old, carved, ivory, mammoth, tusk, could, contain, the, oldest, known, star, chart, resembling, the, constellation, orion, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, drawings, on, the, wall, of, the, lascaux, caves, in, france, dating, from, 33, 000, to, 10, 000, years, ago, could, be, a, graphical, representation, of, the, pleiades, the, summer, triangle, and, the, northern, crown, ancient, structures, with, possibly, astronomical, alignments, such, as, stonehenge, probably, fulfilled, astronomical, religious, and, social, functions, calendars, of, the, world, have, often, been, set, by, observations, of, the, sun, and, moon, marking, the, day, month, and, year, and, were, important, to, agricultural, societies, in, which, the, harvest, depended, on, planting, at, the, correct, time, of, year, and, for, which, the, nearly, full, moon, was, the, only, lighting, for, night, time, travel, into, city, markets, the, common, modern, calendar, is, based, on, the, roman, calendar, although, originally, a, lunar, calendar, it, broke, the, traditional, link, of, the, month, to, the, phases, of, the, moon, and, divided, the, year, into, twelve, almost, equal, months, that, mostly, alternated, between, thirty, and, thirty, one, days, julius, caesar, instigated, calendar, reform, in, 46, bc, and, introduced, what, is, now, called, the, julian, calendar, based, upon, the, 365, 1, 4, day, year, length, originally, proposed, by, the, 4th, century, bc, greek, astronomer, callippus, since, 1990, our, understanding, of, prehistoric, europeans, has, been, radically, changed, by, discoveries, of, ancient, astronomical, artifacts, throughout, europe, the, artifacts, demonstrate, that, neolithic, and, bronze, age, europeans, had, a, sophisticated, knowledge, of, mathematics, and, astronomy, among, the, discoveries, are, the, origins, of, astronomy, can, be, found, in, mesopotamia, the, land, between, the, rivers, tigris, and, euphrates, where, the, ancient, kingdoms, of, sumer, assyria, and, babylonia, were, located, a, form, of, writing, known, as, cuneiform, emerged, among, the, sumerians, around, 3500, 3000, bc, our, knowledge, of, sumerian, astronomy, is, indirect, via, the, earliest, babylonian, star, catalogues, dating, from, about, 1200, bc, the, fact, that, many, star, names, appear, in, sumerian, suggests, a, continuity, reaching, into, the, early, bronze, age, astral, theology, which, gave, planetary, gods, an, important, role, in, mesopotamian, mythology, and, religion, began, with, the, sumerians, they, also, used, a, sexagesimal, base, 60, place, value, number, system, which, simplified, the, task, of, recording, very, large, and, very, small, numbers, the, modern, practice, of, dividing, a, circle, into, 360, degrees, or, an, hour, into, 60, minutes, began, with, the, sumerians, for, more, information, see, the, articles, on, babylonian, numerals, and, mathematics, classical, sources, frequently, use, the, term, chaldeans, for, the, astronomers, of, mesopotamia, who, were, in, reality, priest, scribes, specializing, in, astrology, and, other, forms, of, divination, the, first, evidence, of, recognition, that, astronomical, phenomena, are, periodic, and, of, the, application, of, mathematics, to, their, prediction, is, babylonian, tablets, dating, back, to, the, old, babylonian, period, document, the, application, of, mathematics, to, the, variation, in, the, length, of, daylight, over, a, solar, year, centuries, of, babylonian, observations, of, celestial, phenomena, are, recorded, in, the, series, of, cuneiform, tablets, known, as, the, en, ma, anu, enlil, the, oldest, significant, astronomical, text, that, we, possess, is, tablet, 63, of, the, en, ma, anu, enlil, the, venus, tablet, of, ammi, saduqa, which, lists, the, first, and, last, visible, risings, of, venus, over, a, period, of, about, 21, years, and, is, the, earliest, evidence, that, the, phenomena, of, a, planet, were, recognized, as, periodic, the, mul, apin, contains, catalogues, of, stars, and, constellations, as, well, as, schemes, for, predicting, heliacal, risings, and, the, settings, of, the, planets, lengths, of, daylight, measured, by, a, water, clock, gnomon, shadows, and, intercalations, the, babylonian, gu, text, arranges, stars, in, strings, that, lie, along, declination, circles, and, thus, measure, right, ascensions, or, time, intervals, and, also, employs, the, stars, of, the, zenith, which, are, also, separated, by, given, right, ascensional, differences, a, significant, increase, in, the, quality, and, frequency, of, babylonian, observations, appeared, during, the, reign, of, nabonassar, 747, 733, bc, the, systematic, records, of, ominous, phenomena, in, babylonian, astronomical, diaries, that, began, at, this, time, allowed, for, the, discovery, of, a, repeating, 18, year, cycle, of, lunar, eclipses, for, example, the, greek, astronomer, ptolemy, later, used, nabonassar, s, reign, to, fix, the, beginning, of, an, era, since, he, felt, that, the, earliest, usable, observations, began, at, this, time, the, last, stages, in, the, development, of, babylonian, astronomy, took, place, during, the, time, of, the, seleucid, empire, 323, 60, bc, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, astronomers, began, to, use, goal, year, texts, to, predict, the, motions, of, the, planets, these, texts, compiled, records, of, past, observations, to, find, repeating, occurrences, of, ominous, phenomena, for, each, planet, about, the, same, time, or, shortly, afterwards, astronomers, created, mathematical, models, that, allowed, them, to, predict, these, phenomena, directly, without, consulting, records, a, notable, babylonian, astronomer, from, this, time, was, seleucus, of, seleucia, who, was, a, supporter, of, the, heliocentric, model, babylonian, astronomy, was, the, basis, for, much, of, what, was, done, in, greek, and, hellenistic, astronomy, in, classical, indian, astronomy, in, sassanian, iran, in, byzantium, in, syria, in, islamic, astronomy, in, central, asia, and, in, western, europe, astronomy, in, the, indian, subcontinent, dates, back, to, the, period, of, indus, valley, civilisation, during, 3rd, millennium, bc, when, it, was, used, to, create, calendars, as, the, indus, valley, civilization, did, not, leave, behind, written, documents, the, oldest, extant, indian, astronomical, text, is, the, vedanga, jyotisha, dating, from, the, vedic, period, the, vedanga, jyotisha, is, attributed, to, lagadha, and, has, an, internal, date, of, approximately, 1350, bc, and, describes, rules, for, tracking, the, motions, of, the, sun, and, the, moon, for, the, purposes, of, ritual, it, is, available, in, two, recensions, one, belonging, to, the, rig, veda, and, the, other, to, the, yajur, veda, according, to, the, vedanga, jyotisha, in, a, yuga, or, era, there, are, 5, solar, years, 67, lunar, sidereal, cycles, 1, 830, days, 1, 835, sidereal, days, and, 62, synodic, months, during, the, 6th, century, astronomy, was, influenced, by, the, greek, and, byzantine, astronomical, traditions, aryabhata, 476, 550, in, his, magnum, opus, aryabhatiya, 499, propounded, a, computational, system, based, on, a, planetary, model, in, which, the, earth, was, taken, to, be, spinning, on, its, axis, and, the, periods, of, the, planets, were, given, with, respect, to, the, sun, he, accurately, calculated, many, astronomical, constants, such, as, the, periods, of, the, planets, times, of, the, solar, and, lunar, eclipses, and, the, instantaneous, motion, of, the, moon, early, followers, of, aryabhata, s, model, included, var, hamihira, brahmagupta, and, bh, skara, ii, astronomy, was, advanced, during, the, shunga, empire, and, many, star, catalogues, were, produced, during, this, time, the, shunga, period, is, known, as, the, golden, age, of, astronomy, in, india, it, saw, the, development, of, calculations, for, the, motions, and, places, of, various, planets, their, rising, and, setting, conjunctions, and, the, calculation, of, eclipses, indian, astronomers, by, the, 6th, century, believed, that, comets, were, celestial, bodies, that, re, appeared, periodically, this, was, the, view, expressed, in, the, 6th, century, by, the, astronomers, varahamihira, and, bhadrabahu, and, the, 10th, century, astronomer, bhattotpala, listed, the, names, and, estimated, periods, of, certain, comets, but, it, is, unfortunately, not, known, how, these, figures, were, calculated, or, how, accurate, they, were, the, ancient, greeks, developed, astronomy, which, they, treated, as, a, branch, of, mathematics, to, a, highly, sophisticated, level, the, first, geometrical, three, dimensional, models, to, explain, the, apparent, motion, of, the, planets, were, developed, in, the, 4th, century, bc, by, eudoxus, of, cnidus, and, callippus, of, cyzicus, their, models, were, based, on, nested, homocentric, spheres, centered, upon, the, earth, their, younger, contemporary, heraclides, ponticus, proposed, that, the, earth, rotates, around, its, axis, a, different, approach, to, celestial, phenomena, was, taken, by, natural, philosophers, such, as, plato, and, aristotle, they, were, less, concerned, with, developing, mathematical, predictive, models, than, with, developing, an, explanation, of, the, reasons, for, the, motions, of, the, cosmos, in, his, timaeus, plato, described, the, universe, as, a, spherical, body, divided, into, circles, carrying, the, planets, and, governed, according, to, harmonic, intervals, by, a, world, soul, aristotle, drawing, on, the, mathematical, model, of, eudoxus, proposed, that, the, universe, was, made, of, a, complex, system, of, concentric, spheres, whose, circular, motions, combined, to, carry, the, planets, around, the, earth, this, basic, cosmological, model, prevailed, in, various, forms, until, the, 16th, century, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, aristarchus, of, samos, was, the, first, to, suggest, a, heliocentric, system, although, only, fragmentary, descriptions, of, his, idea, survive, eratosthenes, estimated, the, circumference, of, the, earth, with, great, accuracy, see, also, history, of, geodesy, greek, geometrical, astronomy, developed, away, from, the, model, of, concentric, spheres, to, employ, more, complex, models, in, which, an, eccentric, circle, would, carry, around, a, smaller, circle, called, an, epicycle, which, in, turn, carried, around, a, planet, the, first, such, model, is, attributed, to, apollonius, of, perga, and, further, developments, in, it, were, carried, out, in, the, 2nd, century, bc, by, hipparchus, of, nicea, hipparchus, made, a, number, of, other, contributions, including, the, first, measurement, of, precession, and, the, compilation, of, the, first, star, catalog, in, which, he, proposed, our, modern, system, of, apparent, magnitudes, the, antikythera, mechanism, an, ancient, greek, astronomical, observational, device, for, calculating, the, movements, of, the, sun, and, the, moon, possibly, the, planets, dates, from, about, 150, 100, bc, and, was, the, first, ancestor, of, an, astronomical, computer, it, was, discovered, in, an, ancient, shipwreck, off, the, greek, island, of, antikythera, between, kythera, and, crete, the, device, became, famous, for, its, use, of, a, differential, gear, previously, believed, to, have, been, invented, in, the, 16th, century, and, the, miniaturization, and, complexity, of, its, parts, comparable, to, a, clock, made, in, the, 18th, century, the, original, mechanism, is, displayed, in, the, bronze, collection, of, the, national, archaeological, museum, of, athens, accompanied, by, a, replica, depending, on, the, historian, s, viewpoint, the, acme, or, corruption, of, classical, physical, astronomy, is, seen, with, ptolemy, a, greco, roman, astronomer, from, alexandria, of, egypt, who, wrote, the, classic, comprehensive, presentation, of, geocentric, astronomy, the, megale, syntaxis, great, synthesis, better, known, by, its, arabic, title, almagest, which, had, a, lasting, effect, on, astronomy, up, to, the, renaissance, in, his, planetary, hypotheses, ptolemy, ventured, into, the, realm, of, cosmology, developing, a, physical, model, of, his, geometric, system, in, a, universe, many, times, smaller, than, the, more, realistic, conception, of, aristarchus, of, samos, four, centuries, earlier, the, precise, orientation, of, the, egyptian, pyramids, affords, a, lasting, demonstration, of, the, high, degree, of, technical, skill, in, watching, the, heavens, attained, in, the, 3rd, millennium, bc, it, has, been, shown, the, pyramids, were, aligned, towards, the, pole, star, which, because, of, the, precession, of, the, equinoxes, was, at, that, time, thuban, a, faint, star, in, the, constellation, of, draco, evaluation, of, the, site, of, the, temple, of, amun, re, at, karnak, taking, into, account, the, change, over, time, of, the, obliquity, of, the, ecliptic, has, shown, that, the, great, temple, was, aligned, on, the, rising, of, the, midwinter, sun, the, length, of, the, corridor, down, which, sunlight, would, travel, would, have, limited, illumination, at, other, times, of, the, year, the, egyptians, also, found, the, position, of, sirius, the, dog, star, who, they, believed, was, anubis, their, jackal, headed, god, moving, through, the, heavens, its, position, was, critical, to, their, civilisation, as, when, it, rose, heliacal, in, the, east, before, sunrise, it, foretold, the, flooding, of, the, nile, it, is, also, the, origin, of, the, phrase, dog, days, of, summer, astronomy, played, a, considerable, part, in, religious, matters, for, fixing, the, dates, of, festivals, and, determining, the, hours, of, the, night, the, titles, of, several, temple, books, are, preserved, recording, the, movements, and, phases, of, the, sun, moon, and, stars, the, rising, of, sirius, egyptian, sopdet, greek, sothis, at, the, beginning, of, the, inundation, was, a, particularly, important, point, to, fix, in, the, yearly, calendar, writing, in, the, roman, era, clement, of, alexandria, gives, some, idea, of, the, importance, of, astronomical, observations, to, the, sacred, rites, and, after, the, singer, advances, the, astrologer, with, a, horologium, in, his, hand, and, a, palm, the, symbols, of, astrology, he, must, know, by, heart, the, hermetic, astrological, books, which, are, four, in, number, of, these, one, is, about, the, arrangement, of, the, fixed, stars, that, are, visible, one, on, the, positions, of, the, sun, and, moon, and, five, planets, one, on, the, conjunctions, and, phases, of, the, sun, and, moon, and, one, concerns, their, risings, the, astrologer, s, instruments, horologium, and, palm, are, a, plumb, line, and, sighting, instrument, they, have, been, identified, with, two, inscribed, objects, in, the, berlin, museum, a, short, handle, from, which, a, plumb, line, was, hung, and, a, palm, branch, with, a, sight, slit, in, the, broader, end, the, latter, was, held, close, to, the, eye, the, former, in, the, other, hand, perhaps, at, arm, s, length, the, hermetic, books, which, clement, refers, to, are, the, egyptian, theological, texts, which, probably, have, nothing, to, do, with, hellenistic, hermetism, from, the, tables, of, stars, on, the, ceiling, of, the, tombs, of, rameses, vi, and, rameses, ix, it, seems, that, for, fixing, the, hours, of, the, night, a, man, seated, on, the, ground, faced, the, astrologer, in, such, a, position, that, the, line, of, observation, of, the, pole, star, passed, over, the, middle, of, his, head, on, the, different, days, of, the, year, each, hour, was, determined, by, a, fixed, star, culminating, or, nearly, culminating, in, it, and, the, position, of, these, stars, at, the, time, is, given, in, the, tables, as, in, the, centre, on, the, left, eye, on, the, right, shoulder, etc, according, to, the, texts, in, founding, or, rebuilding, temples, the, north, axis, was, determined, by, the, same, apparatus, and, we, may, conclude, that, it, was, the, usual, one, for, astronomical, observations, in, careful, hands, it, might, give, results, of, a, high, degree, of, accuracy, the, astronomy, of, east, asia, began, in, china, solar, term, was, completed, in, warring, states, period, the, knowledge, of, chinese, astronomy, was, introduced, into, east, asia, astronomy, in, china, has, a, long, history, detailed, records, of, astronomical, observations, were, kept, from, about, the, 6th, century, bc, until, the, introduction, of, western, astronomy, and, the, telescope, in, the, 17th, century, chinese, astronomers, were, able, to, precisely, predict, eclipses, much, of, early, chinese, astronomy, was, for, the, purpose, of, timekeeping, the, chinese, used, a, lunisolar, calendar, but, because, the, cycles, of, the, sun, and, the, moon, are, different, astronomers, often, prepared, new, calendars, and, made, observations, for, that, purpose, astrological, divination, was, also, an, important, part, of, astronomy, astronomers, took, careful, note, of, guest, stars, chinese, pinyin, k, x, ng, lit, guest, star, which, suddenly, appeared, among, the, fixed, stars, they, were, the, first, to, record, a, supernova, in, the, astrological, annals, of, the, houhanshu, in, 185, ad, also, the, supernova, that, created, the, crab, nebula, in, 1054, is, an, example, of, a, guest, star, observed, by, chinese, astronomers, although, it, was, not, recorded, by, their, european, contemporaries, ancient, astronomical, records, of, phenomena, like, supernovae, and, comets, are, sometimes, used, in, modern, astronomical, studies, the, world, s, first, star, catalogue, was, made, by, gan, de, a, chinese, astronomer, in, the, 4th, century, bc, maya, astronomical, codices, include, detailed, tables, for, calculating, phases, of, the, moon, the, recurrence, of, eclipses, and, the, appearance, and, disappearance, of, venus, as, morning, and, evening, star, the, maya, based, their, calendrics, in, the, carefully, calculated, cycles, of, the, pleiades, the, sun, the, moon, venus, jupiter, saturn, mars, and, also, they, had, a, precise, description, of, the, eclipses, as, depicted, in, the, dresden, codex, as, well, as, the, ecliptic, or, zodiac, and, the, milky, way, was, crucial, in, their, cosmology, a, number, of, important, maya, structures, are, believed, to, have, been, oriented, toward, the, extreme, risings, and, settings, of, venus, to, the, ancient, maya, venus, was, the, patron, of, war, and, many, recorded, battles, are, believed, to, have, been, timed, to, the, motions, of, this, planet, mars, is, also, mentioned, in, preserved, astronomical, codices, and, early, mythology, although, the, maya, calendar, was, not, tied, to, the, sun, john, teeple, has, proposed, that, the, maya, calculated, the, solar, year, to, somewhat, greater, accuracy, than, the, gregorian, calendar, both, astronomy, and, an, intricate, numerological, scheme, for, the, measurement, of, time, were, vitally, important, components, of, maya, religion, the, maya, believed, that, the, earth, was, the, center, of, all, things, and, that, the, stars, moons, and, planets, were, gods, they, believed, that, their, movements, were, the, gods, traveling, between, the, earth, and, other, celestial, destinations, many, key, events, in, maya, culture, were, timed, around, celestial, events, in, the, belief, that, certain, gods, would, be, present, the, arabic, and, the, persian, world, under, islam, had, become, highly, cultured, and, many, important, works, of, knowledge, from, greek, astronomy, and, indian, astronomy, and, persian, astronomy, were, translated, into, arabic, used, and, stored, in, libraries, throughout, the, area, an, important, contribution, by, islamic, astronomers, was, their, emphasis, on, observational, astronomy, this, led, to, the, emergence, of, the, first, astronomical, observatories, in, the, muslim, world, by, the, early, 9th, century, zij, star, catalogues, were, produced, at, these, observatories, in, the, 9th, century, persian, astrologer, albumasar, was, thought, to, be, one, of, the, greatest, astrologer, at, that, time, his, practical, manuals, for, training, astrologers, profoundly, influenced, muslim, intellectual, history, and, through, translations, that, of, western, europe, and, byzantium, in, the, 10th, century, albumasar, s, introduction, was, one, of, the, most, important, sources, for, the, recovery, of, aristotle, for, medieval, european, scholars, abd, al, rahman, al, sufi, azophi, carried, out, observations, on, the, stars, and, described, their, positions, magnitudes, brightness, and, colour, and, drawings, for, each, constellation, in, his, book, of, fixed, stars, he, also, gave, the, first, descriptions, and, pictures, of, a, little, cloud, now, known, as, the, andromeda, galaxy, he, mentions, it, as, lying, before, the, mouth, of, a, big, fish, an, arabic, constellation, this, cloud, was, apparently, commonly, known, to, the, isfahan, astronomers, very, probably, before, 905, ad, the, first, recorded, mention, of, the, large, magellanic, cloud, was, also, given, by, al, sufi, in, 1006, ali, ibn, ridwan, observed, sn, 1006, the, brightest, supernova, in, recorded, history, and, left, a, detailed, description, of, the, temporary, star, in, the, late, 10th, century, a, huge, observatory, was, built, near, tehran, iran, by, the, astronomer, abu, mahmud, al, khujandi, who, observed, a, series, of, meridian, transits, of, the, sun, which, allowed, him, to, calculate, the, tilt, of, the, earth, s, axis, relative, to, the, sun, he, noted, that, measurements, by, earlier, indian, then, greek, astronomers, had, found, higher, values, for, this, angle, possible, evidence, that, the, axial, tilt, is, not, constant, but, was, in, fact, decreasing, in, 11th, century, persia, omar, khayy, m, compiled, many, tables, and, performed, a, reformation, of, the, calendar, that, was, more, accurate, than, the, julian, and, came, close, to, the, gregorian, other, muslim, advances, in, astronomy, included, the, collection, and, correction, of, previous, astronomical, data, resolving, significant, problems, in, the, ptolemaic, model, the, development, of, the, universal, latitude, independent, astrolabe, by, arzachel, the, invention, of, numerous, other, astronomical, instruments, ja, far, muhammad, ibn, m, s, ibn, sh, kir, s, belief, that, the, heavenly, bodies, and, celestial, spheres, were, subject, to, the, same, physical, laws, as, earth, and, the, introduction, of, empirical, testing, by, ibn, al, shatir, who, produced, the, first, model, of, lunar, motion, which, matched, physical, observations, natural, philosophy, particularly, aristotelian, physics, was, separated, from, astronomy, by, ibn, al, haytham, alhazen, in, the, 11th, century, by, ibn, al, shatir, in, the, 14th, century, and, qushji, in, the, 15th, century, bh, skara, ii, 1114, 1185, was, the, head, of, the, astronomical, observatory, at, ujjain, continuing, the, mathematical, tradition, of, brahmagupta, he, wrote, the, siddhantasiromani, which, consists, of, two, parts, goladhyaya, sphere, and, grahaganita, mathematics, of, the, planets, he, also, calculated, the, time, taken, for, the, earth, to, orbit, the, sun, to, 9, decimal, places, the, buddhist, university, of, nalanda, at, the, time, offered, formal, courses, in, astronomical, studies, other, important, astronomers, from, india, include, madhava, of, sangamagrama, nilakantha, somayaji, and, jyeshtadeva, who, were, members, of, the, kerala, school, of, astronomy, and, mathematics, from, the, 14th, century, to, the, 16th, century, nilakantha, somayaji, in, his, aryabhatiyabhasya, a, commentary, on, aryabhata, s, aryabhatiya, developed, his, own, computational, system, for, a, partially, heliocentric, planetary, model, in, which, mercury, venus, mars, jupiter, and, saturn, orbit, the, sun, which, in, turn, orbits, the, earth, similar, to, the, tychonic, system, later, proposed, by, tycho, brahe, in, the, late, 16th, century, nilakantha, s, system, however, was, mathematically, more, efficient, than, the, tychonic, system, due, to, correctly, taking, into, account, the, equation, of, the, centre, and, latitudinal, motion, of, mercury, and, venus, most, astronomers, of, the, kerala, school, of, astronomy, and, mathematics, who, followed, him, accepted, his, planetary, model, after, the, significant, contributions, of, greek, scholars, to, the, development, of, astronomy, it, entered, a, relatively, static, era, in, western, europe, from, the, roman, era, through, the, 12th, century, this, lack, of, progress, has, led, some, astronomers, to, assert, that, nothing, happened, in, western, european, astronomy, during, the, middle, ages, recent, investigations, however, have, revealed, a, more, complex, picture, of, the, study, and, teaching, of, astronomy, in, the, period, from, the, 4th, to, the, 16th, centuries, western, europe, entered, the, middle, ages, with, great, difficulties, that, affected, the, continent, s, intellectual, production, the, advanced, astronomical, treatises, of, classical, antiquity, were, written, in, greek, and, with, the, decline, of, knowledge, of, that, language, only, simplified, summaries, and, practical, texts, were, available, for, study, the, most, influential, writers, to, pass, on, this, ancient, tradition, in, latin, were, macrobius, pliny, martianus, capella, and, calcidius, in, the, 6th, century, bishop, gregory, of, tours, noted, that, he, had, learned, his, astronomy, from, reading, martianus, capella, and, went, on, to, employ, this, rudimentary, astronomy, to, describe, a, method, by, which, monks, could, determine, the, time, of, prayer, at, night, by, watching, the, stars, in, the, 7th, century, the, english, monk, bede, of, jarrow, published, an, influential, text, on, the, reckoning, of, time, providing, churchmen, with, the, practical, astronomical, knowledge, needed, to, compute, the, proper, date, of, easter, using, a, procedure, called, the, computus, this, text, remained, an, important, element, of, the, education, of, clergy, from, the, 7th, century, until, well, after, the, rise, of, the, universities, in, the, 12th, century, the, range, of, surviving, ancient, roman, writings, on, astronomy, and, the, teachings, of, bede, and, his, followers, began, to, be, studied, in, earnest, during, the, revival, of, learning, sponsored, by, the, emperor, charlemagne, by, the, 9th, century, rudimentary, techniques, for, calculating, the, position, of, the, planets, were, circulating, in, western, europe, medieval, scholars, recognized, their, flaws, but, texts, describing, these, techniques, continued, to, be, copied, reflecting, an, interest, in, the, motions, of, the, planets, and, in, their, astrological, significance, building, on, this, astronomical, background, in, the, 10th, century, european, scholars, such, as, gerbert, of, aurillac, began, to, travel, to, spain, and, sicily, to, seek, out, learning, which, they, had, heard, existed, in, the, arabic, speaking, world, there, they, first, encountered, various, practical, astronomical, techniques, concerning, the, calendar, and, timekeeping, most, notably, those, dealing, with, the, astrolabe, soon, scholars, such, as, hermann, of, reichenau, were, writing, texts, in, latin, on, the, uses, and, construction, of, the, astrolabe, and, others, such, as, walcher, of, malvern, were, using, the, astrolabe, to, observe, the, time, of, eclipses, in, order, to, test, the, validity, of, computistical, tables, by, the, 12th, century, scholars, were, traveling, to, spain, and, sicily, to, seek, out, more, advanced, astronomical, and, astrological, texts, which, they, translated, into, latin, from, arabic, and, greek, to, further, enrich, the, astronomical, knowledge, of, western, europe, the, arrival, of, these, new, texts, coincided, with, the, rise, of, the, universities, in, medieval, europe, in, which, they, soon, found, a, home, reflecting, the, introduction, of, astronomy, into, the, universities, john, of, sacrobosco, wrote, a, series, of, influential, introductory, astronomy, textbooks, the, sphere, a, computus, a, text, on, the, quadrant, and, another, on, calculation, in, the, 14th, century, nicole, oresme, later, bishop, of, liseux, showed, that, neither, the, scriptural, texts, nor, the, physical, arguments, advanced, against, the, movement, of, the, earth, were, demonstrative, and, adduced, the, argument, of, simplicity, for, the, theory, that, the, earth, moves, and, not, the, heavens, however, he, concluded, everyone, maintains, and, i, think, myself, that, the, heavens, do, move, and, not, the, earth, for, god, hath, established, the, world, which, shall, not, be, moved, in, the, 15th, century, cardinal, nicholas, of, cusa, suggested, in, some, of, his, scientific, writings, that, the, earth, revolved, around, the, sun, and, that, each, star, is, itself, a, distant, sun, during, the, renaissance, period, astronomy, began, to, undergo, a, revolution, in, thought, known, as, the, copernican, revolution, which, gets, the, name, from, the, astronomer, nicolaus, copernicus, who, proposed, a, heliocentric, system, in, which, the, planets, revolved, around, the, sun, and, not, the, earth, his, de, revolutionibus, orbium, coelestium, was, published, in, 1543, while, in, the, long, term, this, was, a, very, controversial, claim, in, the, very, beginning, it, only, brought, minor, controversy, the, theory, became, the, dominant, view, because, many, figures, most, notably, galileo, galilei, johannes, kepler, and, isaac, newton, championed, and, improved, upon, the, work, other, figures, also, aided, this, new, model, despite, not, believing, the, overall, theory, like, tycho, brahe, with, his, well, known, observations, brahe, a, danish, noble, was, an, essential, astronomer, in, this, period, he, came, on, the, astronomical, scene, with, the, publication, of, de, nova, stella, in, which, he, disproved, conventional, wisdom, on, the, supernova, sn, 1572, as, bright, as, venus, at, its, peak, sn, 1572, later, became, invisible, to, the, naked, eye, disproving, the, aristotelian, doctrine, of, the, immutability, of, the, heavens, he, also, created, the, tychonic, system, where, the, sun, and, moon, and, the, stars, revolve, around, the, earth, but, the, other, five, planets, revolve, around, the, sun, this, system, blended, the, mathematical, benefits, of, the, copernican, system, with, the, physical, benefits, of, the, ptolemaic, system, this, was, one, of, the, systems, people, believed, in, when, they, did, not, accept, heliocentrism, but, could, no, longer, accept, the, ptolemaic, system, he, is, most, known, for, his, highly, accurate, observations, of, the, stars, and, the, solar, system, later, he, moved, to, prague, and, continued, his, work, in, prague, he, was, at, work, on, the, rudolphine, tables, that, were, not, finished, until, after, his, death, the, rudolphine, tables, was, a, star, map, designed, to, be, more, accurate, than, either, the, alfonsine, tables, made, in, the, 1300s, and, the, prutenic, tables, which, were, inaccurate, he, was, assisted, at, this, time, by, his, assistant, johannes, kepler, who, would, later, use, his, observations, to, finish, brahe, s, works, and, for, his, theories, as, well, after, the, death, of, brahe, kepler, was, deemed, his, successor, and, was, given, the, job, of, completing, brahe, s, uncompleted, works, like, the, rudolphine, tables, he, completed, the, rudolphine, tables, in, 1624, although, it, was, not, published, for, several, years, like, many, other, figures, of, this, era, he, was, subject, to, religious, and, political, troubles, like, the, thirty, years, war, which, led, to, chaos, that, almost, destroyed, some, of, his, works, kepler, was, however, the, first, to, attempt, to, derive, mathematical, predictions, of, celestial, motions, from, assumed, physical, causes, he, discovered, the, three, kepler, s, laws, of, planetary, motion, that, now, carry, his, name, those, laws, being, as, follows, with, these, laws, he, managed, to, improve, upon, the, existing, heliocentric, model, the, first, two, were, published, in, 1609, kepler, s, contributions, improved, upon, the, overall, system, giving, it, more, credibility, because, it, adequately, explained, events, and, could, cause, more, reliable, predictions, before, this, the, copernican, model, was, just, as, unreliable, as, the, ptolemaic, model, this, improvement, came, because, kepler, realized, the, orbits, were, not, perfect, circles, but, ellipses, galileo, galilei, was, among, the, first, to, use, a, telescope, to, observe, the, sky, and, after, constructing, a, 20x, refractor, telescope, he, discovered, the, four, largest, moons, of, jupiter, in, 1610, which, are, now, collectively, known, as, the, galilean, moons, in, his, honor, this, discovery, was, the, first, known, observation, of, satellites, orbiting, another, planet, he, also, found, that, the, moon, had, craters, and, observed, and, correctly, explained, sunspots, and, that, venus, exhibited, a, full, set, of, phases, resembling, lunar, phases, galileo, argued, that, these, facts, demonstrated, incompatibility, with, the, ptolemaic, model, which, could, not, explain, the, phenomenon, and, would, even, contradict, it, with, the, moons, it, demonstrated, that, the, earth, does, not, have, to, have, everything, orbiting, it, and, that, other, parts, of, the, solar, system, could, orbit, another, object, such, as, the, earth, orbiting, the, sun, in, the, ptolemaic, system, the, celestial, bodies, were, supposed, to, be, perfect, so, such, objects, should, not, have, craters, or, sunspots, the, phases, of, venus, could, only, happen, in, the, event, that, venus, orbit, is, inside, earth, s, orbit, which, could, not, happen, if, the, earth, was, the, center, he, as, the, most, famous, example, had, to, face, challenges, from, church, officials, more, specifically, the, roman, inquisition, they, accused, him, of, heresy, because, these, beliefs, went, against, the, teachings, of, the, roman, catholic, church, and, were, challenging, the, catholic, church, s, authority, when, it, was, at, its, weakest, while, he, was, able, to, avoid, punishment, for, a, little, while, he, was, eventually, tried, and, pled, guilty, to, heresy, in, 1633, although, this, came, at, some, expense, his, book, was, banned, and, he, was, put, under, house, arrest, until, he, died, in, 1642, sir, isaac, newton, developed, further, ties, between, physics, and, astronomy, through, his, law, of, universal, gravitation, realizing, that, the, same, force, that, attracts, objects, to, the, surface, of, the, earth, held, the, moon, in, orbit, around, the, earth, newton, was, able, to, explain, in, one, theoretical, framework, all, known, gravitational, phenomena, in, his, philosophi, naturalis, principia, mathematica, he, derived, kepler, s, laws, from, first, principles, those, first, principles, are, as, follows, thus, while, kepler, explained, how, the, planets, moved, newton, accurately, managed, to, explain, why, the, planets, moved, the, way, they, do, newton, s, theoretical, developments, laid, many, of, the, foundations, of, modern, physics, outside, of, england, newton, s, theory, took, some, time, to, become, established, descartes, theory, of, vortices, held, sway, in, france, and, huygens, leibniz, and, cassini, accepted, only, parts, of, newton, s, system, preferring, their, own, philosophies, voltaire, published, a, popular, account, in, 1738, in, 1748, the, french, academy, of, sciences, offered, a, reward, for, solving, the, perturbations, of, jupiter, and, saturn, which, was, eventually, solved, by, euler, and, lagrange, laplace, completed, the, theory, of, the, planets, publishing, from, 1798, to, 1825, the, early, origins, of, the, solar, nebular, model, of, planetary, formation, had, begun, edmond, halley, succeeded, flamsteed, as, astronomer, royal, in, england, and, succeeded, in, predicting, the, return, of, the, comet, that, bears, his, name, in, 1758, sir, william, herschel, found, the, first, new, planet, uranus, to, be, observed, in, modern, times, in, 1781, the, gap, between, the, planets, mars, and, jupiter, disclosed, by, the, titius, bode, law, was, filled, by, the, discovery, of, the, asteroids, ceres, and, pallas, in, 1801, and, 1802, with, many, more, following, at, first, astronomical, thought, in, america, was, based, on, aristotelian, philosophy, but, interest, in, the, new, astronomy, began, to, appear, in, almanacs, as, early, as, 1659, cosmic, pluralism, is, the, name, given, to, the, idea, that, the, stars, are, distant, suns, perhaps, with, their, own, planetary, systems, ideas, in, this, direction, were, expressed, in, antiquity, by, anaxagoras, and, by, aristarchus, of, samos, but, did, not, find, mainstream, acceptance, the, first, astronomer, of, the, european, renaissance, to, suggest, that, the, stars, were, distant, suns, was, giordano, bruno, in, his, de, l, infinito, universo, et, mondi, 1584, this, idea, together, with, a, belief, in, intelligent, extraterrestrial, life, was, among, the, charges, brought, against, him, by, the, inquisition, the, idea, became, mainstream, in, the, later, 17th, century, especially, following, the, publication, of, conversations, on, the, plurality, of, worlds, by, bernard, le, bovier, de, fontenelle, 1686, and, by, the, early, 18th, century, it, was, the, default, working, assumptions, in, stellar, astronomy, the, italian, astronomer, geminiano, montanari, recorded, observing, variations, in, luminosity, of, the, star, algol, in, 1667, edmond, halley, published, the, first, measurements, of, the, proper, motion, of, a, pair, of, nearby, fixed, stars, demonstrating, that, they, had, changed, positions, since, the, time, of, the, ancient, greek, astronomers, ptolemy, and, hipparchus, william, herschel, was, the, first, astronomer, to, attempt, to, determine, the, distribution, of, stars, in, the, sky, during, the, 1780s, he, established, a, series, of, gauges, in, 600, directions, and, counted, the, stars, observed, along, each, line, of, sight, from, this, he, deduced, that, the, number, of, stars, steadily, increased, toward, one, side, of, the, sky, in, the, direction, of, the, milky, way, core, his, son, john, herschel, repeated, this, study, in, the, southern, hemisphere, and, found, a, corresponding, increase, in, the, same, direction, in, addition, to, his, other, accomplishments, william, herschel, is, noted, for, his, discovery, that, some, stars, do, not, merely, lie, along, the, same, line, of, sight, but, are, physical, companions, that, form, binary, star, systems, pre, photography, data, recording, of, astronomical, data, was, limited, by, the, human, eye, in, 1840, john, w, draper, a, chemist, created, the, earliest, known, astronomical, photograph, of, the, moon, and, by, the, late, 19th, century, thousands, of, photographic, plates, of, images, of, planets, stars, and, galaxies, were, created, most, photography, had, lower, quantum, efficiency, i, e, captured, less, of, the, incident, photons, than, human, eyes, but, had, the, advantage, of, long, integration, times, 100, ms, for, the, human, eye, compared, to, hours, for, photos, this, vastly, increased, the, data, available, to, astronomers, which, led, to, the, rise, of, human, computers, famously, the, harvard, computers, to, track, and, analyze, the, data, scientists, began, discovering, forms, of, light, which, were, invisible, to, the, naked, eye, x, rays, gamma, rays, radio, waves, microwaves, ultraviolet, radiation, and, infrared, radiation, this, had, a, major, impact, on, astronomy, spawning, the, fields, of, infrared, astronomy, radio, astronomy, x, ray, astronomy, and, finally, gamma, ray, astronomy, with, the, advent, of, spectroscopy, it, was, proven, that, other, stars, were, similar, to, the, sun, but, with, a, range, of, temperatures, masses, and, sizes, the, science, of, stellar, spectroscopy, was, pioneered, by, joseph, von, fraunhofer, and, angelo, secchi, by, comparing, the, spectra, of, stars, such, as, sirius, to, the, sun, they, found, differences, in, the, strength, and, number, of, their, absorption, lines, the, dark, lines, in, stellar, spectra, caused, by, the, atmosphere, s, absorption, of, specific, frequencies, in, 1865, secchi, began, classifying, stars, into, spectral, types, the, first, evidence, of, helium, was, observed, on, august, 18, 1868, as, a, bright, yellow, spectral, line, with, a, wavelength, of, 587, 49, nanometers, in, the, spectrum, of, the, chromosphere, of, the, sun, the, line, was, detected, by, french, astronomer, jules, janssen, during, a, total, solar, eclipse, in, guntur, india, the, first, direct, measurement, of, the, distance, to, a, star, 61, cygni, at, 11, 4, light, years, was, made, in, 1838, by, friedrich, bessel, using, the, parallax, technique, parallax, measurements, demonstrated, the, vast, separation, of, the, stars, in, the, heavens, observation, of, double, stars, gained, increasing, importance, during, the, 19th, century, in, 1834, friedrich, bessel, observed, changes, in, the, proper, motion, of, the, star, sirius, and, inferred, a, hidden, companion, edward, pickering, discovered, the, first, spectroscopic, binary, in, 1899, when, he, observed, the, periodic, splitting, of, the, spectral, lines, of, the, star, mizar, in, a, 104, day, period, detailed, observations, of, many, binary, star, systems, were, collected, by, astronomers, such, as, friedrich, georg, wilhelm, von, struve, and, s, w, burnham, allowing, the, masses, of, stars, to, be, determined, from, the, computation, of, orbital, elements, the, first, solution, to, the, problem, of, deriving, an, orbit, of, binary, stars, from, telescope, observations, was, made, by, felix, savary, in, 1827, in, 1847, maria, mitchell, discovered, a, comet, using, a, telescope, with, the, accumulation, of, large, sets, of, astronomical, data, teams, like, the, harvard, computers, rose, in, prominence, which, led, to, many, female, astronomers, previously, relegated, as, assistants, to, male, astronomers, gaining, recognition, in, the, field, the, united, states, naval, observatory, usno, and, other, astronomy, research, institutions, hired, human, computers, who, performed, the, tedious, calculations, while, scientists, performed, research, requiring, more, background, knowledge, a, number, of, discoveries, in, this, period, were, originally, noted, by, the, women, computers, and, reported, to, their, supervisors, henrietta, swan, leavitt, discovered, the, cepheid, variable, star, period, luminosity, relation, which, she, further, developed, into, a, method, of, measuring, distance, outside, of, the, solar, system, a, veteran, of, the, harvard, computers, annie, j, cannon, developed, the, modern, version, of, the, stellar, classification, scheme, in, during, the, early, 1900s, o, b, a, f, g, k, m, based, on, color, and, temperature, manually, classifying, more, stars, in, a, lifetime, than, anyone, else, around, 350, 000, the, twentieth, century, saw, increasingly, rapid, advances, in, the, scientific, study, of, stars, karl, schwarzschild, discovered, that, the, color, of, a, star, and, hence, its, temperature, could, be, determined, by, comparing, the, visual, magnitude, against, the, photographic, magnitude, the, development, of, the, photoelectric, photometer, allowed, precise, measurements, of, magnitude, at, multiple, wavelength, intervals, in, 1921, albert, a, michelson, made, the, first, measurements, of, a, stellar, diameter, using, an, interferometer, on, the, hooker, telescope, at, mount, wilson, observatory, important, theoretical, work, on, the, physical, structure, of, stars, occurred, during, the, first, decades, of, the, twentieth, century, in, 1913, the, hertzsprung, russell, diagram, was, developed, propelling, the, astrophysical, study, of, stars, in, potsdam, in, 1906, the, danish, astronomer, ejnar, hertzsprung, published, the, first, plots, of, color, versus, luminosity, for, these, stars, these, plots, showed, a, prominent, and, continuous, sequence, of, stars, which, he, named, the, main, sequence, at, princeton, university, henry, norris, russell, plotted, the, spectral, types, of, these, stars, against, their, absolute, magnitude, and, found, that, dwarf, stars, followed, a, distinct, relationship, this, allowed, the, real, brightness, of, a, dwarf, star, to, be, predicted, with, reasonable, accuracy, successful, models, were, developed, to, explain, the, interiors, of, stars, and, stellar, evolution, cecilia, payne, gaposchkin, first, proposed, that, stars, were, made, primarily, of, hydrogen, and, helium, in, her, 1925, doctoral, thesis, the, spectra, of, stars, were, further, understood, through, advances, in, quantum, physics, this, allowed, the, chemical, composition, of, the, stellar, atmosphere, to, be, determined, as, evolutionary, models, of, stars, were, developed, during, the, 1930s, bengt, str, mgren, introduced, the, term, hertzsprung, russell, diagram, to, denote, a, luminosity, spectral, class, diagram, a, refined, scheme, for, stellar, classification, was, published, in, 1943, by, william, wilson, morgan, and, philip, childs, keenan, the, existence, of, our, galaxy, the, milky, way, as, a, separate, group, of, stars, was, only, proven, in, the, 20th, century, along, with, the, existence, of, external, galaxies, and, soon, after, the, expansion, of, the, universe, seen, in, the, recession, of, most, galaxies, from, us, the, great, debate, between, harlow, shapley, and, heber, curtis, in, the, 1920s, concerned, the, nature, of, the, milky, way, spiral, nebulae, and, the, dimensions, of, the, universe, with, the, advent, of, quantum, physics, spectroscopy, was, further, refined, the, sun, was, found, to, be, part, of, a, galaxy, made, up, of, more, than, 10, 10, stars, 10, billion, stars, the, existence, of, other, galaxies, one, of, the, matters, of, the, great, debate, was, settled, by, edwin, hubble, who, identified, the, andromeda, nebula, as, a, different, galaxy, and, many, others, at, large, distances, and, receding, moving, away, from, our, galaxy, physical, cosmology, a, discipline, that, has, a, large, intersection, with, astronomy, made, huge, advances, during, the, 20th, century, with, the, model, of, the, hot, big, bang, heavily, supported, by, the, evidence, provided, by, astronomy, and, physics, such, as, the, redshifts, of, very, distant, galaxies, and, radio, sources, the, cosmic, microwave, background, radiation, hubble, s, law, and, cosmological, abundances, of, elements
