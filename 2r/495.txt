peaceful, and, stable, period, in, modern, history, came, to, an, end, however, all, out, fighting, did, not, erupt, until, after, 1978, when, the, saur, revolution, violently, overthrew, khan, s, government, and, established, the, democratic, republic, of, afghanistan, subsequent, unrest, over, the, radical, reforms, that, were, being, pushed, by, the, then, ruling, people, s, democratic, party, of, afghanistan, pdpa, led, to, unprecedented, violence, prompting, a, large, scale, pro, pdpa, military, intervention, by, the, soviet, union, in, 1979, in, the, ensuing, soviet, afghan, war, the, anti, soviet, afghan, mujahideen, received, extensive, support, from, pakistan, the, united, states, and, saudi, arabia, in, a, joint, covert, effort, that, was, dubbed, operation, cyclone, although, the, soviets, withdrew, from, afghanistan, in, 1989, the, various, mujahideen, factions, continued, to, fight, against, the, pdpa, government, which, collapsed, in, the, face, of, the, peshawar, accord, in, 1992, however, the, peshawar, accord, failed, to, remain, intact, in, light, of, the, mujahideen, s, representatives, inability, to, reach, an, agreement, on, a, power, sharing, coalition, for, the, new, government, triggering, a, multi, sided, civil, war, between, them, by, 1996, the, taliban, supported, by, pakistan, s, inter, services, intelligence, had, seized, the,

this, time, the, northern, alliance, s, islamic, state, of, afghanistan, enjoyed, widespread, international, recognition, and, was, represented, at, the, united, nations, as, opposed, to, the, taliban, s, islamic, emirate, of, afghanistan, which, only, received, diplomatic, recognition, from, three, nations, despite, the, fall, of, kabul, to, the, taliban, the, northern, alliance, continued, to, resist, in, another, civil, war, for, the, next, five, years, after, the, september, 11, attacks, were, carried, out, by, al, qaeda, against, the, united, states, in, 2001, the,

installing, the, afghan, transitional, authority, in, 2002, the, invasion, triggered, the, 20, year, long, war, in, afghanistan, in, which, nato, and, nato, allied, countries, fought, alongside, the, nascent, islamic, republic, of, afghanistan, to, combat, the, taliban, insurgency, during, the, battle, of, tora, bora, the, american, led, military, coalition, failed, to, capture, bin, laden, who, subsequently, relocated, to, pakistan, and, remained, there, until, he, was, killed, by, u, s, seal, team, six, in, abbottabad, in, 2011, nonetheless, the, fighting, in, afghanistan, continued, eventually, leading, to, the, 2020, 2021, american, withdrawal, and, ultimately, ending, with, the, 2021, taliban, offensive, which, led, to, the, re, establishment, of, the, present, day, islamic, emirate, though, the, country, wide, war, ended, in, 2021, clashes, and, unrest, currently, persist, in, some, parts, of, afghanistan, due, to, the, isis, taliban, conflict, and, the, anti, taliban,

economic, policies, were, leveled, against, the, ruling, dynasty, khan, abolished, the, monarchy, and, declared, the, republic, of, afghanistan, and, he, became, the, first, president, of, afghanistan, he, was, supported, by, a, faction, of, the, people, s, democratic, party, of, afghanistan, pdpa, afghanistan, s, communist, party, which, was, founded, in, 1965, and, enjoyed, a, strong, relationship, with, the, soviet, union, in, the, rise, of, the, taliban, in, afghanistan, mass, mobilization, civil, war, and, the, future, of, the, region, neamatollah, nojumi, writes, the, establishment, of, the, republic, of, afghanistan, increased, the, soviet, investment, in, afghanistan, and, the, pdpa, influence, in, the, government, s, military, and, civil, bodies, in, 1976, alarmed, by, the, growing, power, of, the, pdpa, and, the, party, s, strong, affiliation, with, the, soviet, union, khan, tried, to, scale, back, the, pdpa, s, influence, he, dismissed, pdpa, members, from, their, government, posts, appointed, conservative, elements, instead, and, finally, announced, the, dissolution, of, the, pdpa, arresting, senior, party, members, on, 27, april, 1978, the, pdpa, and, military, units, loyal, to, the, pdpa, revolted, and, killed, khan, his, immediate, family, and, bodyguards, in, a, violent, coup, during, the, battle, to, seize, control, of, the, capital, kabul, in, the, saur, revolution, as, the, pdpa, had, chosen, a, weekend, holiday, to, conduct, the, coup, when, many, government, employees, were, having, a, day, off, khan, was, not, able, to, fully, activate, the, well, trained, armed, forces, which, remained, loyal, to, him, to, counter, the, coup, the, pdpa, formed, a, new, government, through, a, revolutionary, council, which, attempted, to, balance, the, two, major, competing, factions, within, itself, the, more, radical, and, revolutionary, khalq, and, the, more, moderate, and, reformist, parcham, the, khalqist, wing, led, by, the, charismatic, nur, muhammad, taraki, who, became, the, new, chairman, gained, supremacy, in, the, aftermath, of, the, revolution, and, adopted, a, program, of, land, reform, abolition, of, feudal, and, tribal, structures, and, equality, for, women, the, council, also, prefixed, the, term, democratic, to, the, country, s, daoud, era, name, making, it, the, democratic, republic, of, afghanistan, though, these, reforms, were, supported, by, the, army, and, city, dwelling, population, they, opposed, the, very, traditional, religious, and, tribal, customs, of, rural, afghanistan, which, in, turn, led, to, strong, rural, and, clerical, opposition, to, the, government, and, various, anti, government, uprisings, around, this, time, the, party, came, to, be, influenced, by, hafizullah, amin, who, undermined, taraki, despite, being, a, fellow, khalqist, purged, parchamites, from, the, party, and, began, ruthlessly, cracking, down, on, political, opposition, therefore, a, hostile, doctrine, against, any, political, dissent, was, adopted, whether, inside, or, outside, the, party, taraki, who, had, ruled, for, only, about, a, year, was, assassinated, by, amin, who, took, over, formal, leadership, of, the, country, amin, was, known, for, his, independent, and, nationalist, inclinations, and, was, also, seen, by, many, as, a, ruthless, leader, he, has, been, accused, of, killing, tens, of, thousands, of, afghan, civilians, at, pul, e, charkhi, and, other, national, prisons, while, cracking, down, on, both, the, opposition, and, the, parchamites, 27, 000, politically, motivated, executions, reportedly, took, place, at, pul, e, charkhi, prison, alone, afghans, generally, held, amin, personally, responsible, for, most, of, the, repression, while, the, soviet, union, considered, his, government, illegitimate, discredited, and, doomed, to, collapse, in, a, civil, war, the, soviet, union, secured, an, alliance, with, the, more, moderate, babrak, karmal, and, his, parchamite, faction, invading, afghanistan, on, 24, december, 1979, and, originally, meeting, only, limited, resistance, amin, was, deposed, from, power, almost, immediately, as, he, and, 200, of, his, guards, were, killed, during, operation, storm, 333, on, 27, december, by, soviet, army, spetsnaz, replaced, by, karmal, after, deployment, into, afghanistan, soviet, forces, whom, the, locals, dubbed, shuravi, along, with, government, forces, would, begin, to, engage, in, a, protracted, counterinsurgency, war, against, a, wide, coalition, of, various, anti, government, insurgent, forces, who, in, turn, styled, themselves, as, mujahideen, islamic, holy, warriors, karmal, declared, a, general, amnesty, for, people, imprisoned, during, taraki, and, amin, s, rule, and, restored, the, afghan, national, symbols, in, place, of, the, khalqist, red, flag, he, also, granted, several, concessions, to, religious, leaders, and, at, least, partially, restored, property, seized, during, the, original, khalqist, land, reform, however, this, did, not, satisfy, the, opposition, as, they, considered, his, ascension, to, power, during, the, soviet, intervention, to, be, a, mark, that, he, would, rule, as, a, soviet, puppet, thus, continuing, their, insurgency, against, the, government, the, soviet, government, realized, that, a, military, solution, to, the, conflict, would, require, far, more, troops, because, of, this, they, discussed, troop, withdrawals, and, searched, for, a, political, and, peaceful, solution, as, early, as, 1980, but, they, never, took, any, serious, steps, in, that, direction, until, 1988, early, soviet, military, reports, confirm, the, difficulties, the, soviet, army, had, while, fighting, on, the, mountainous, terrain, for, which, the, soviet, army, had, no, training, parallels, with, the, vietnam, war, were, frequently, referred, to, by, soviet, army, officers, policy, failures, and, the, stalemate, that, ensued, after, the, soviet, intervention, led, the, soviet, leadership, to, become, highly, critical, of, karmal, s, leadership, under, mikhail, gorbachev, the, soviet, union, was, able, to, depose, karmal, and, replace, him, with, mohammad, najibullah, karmal, s, leadership, was, seen, as, a, failure, by, the, soviet, union, because, of, the, rise, of, violence, and, crime, during, his, administration, najibullah, another, parchamite, attempted, to, end, the, insurgency, through, a, policy, of, accommodation, and, power, sharing, known, as, the, national, reconciliation, he, reversed, several, of, his, predecessor, s, unpopular, reforms, abolished, the, one, party, system, reinstated, islam, as, the, state, religion, though, still, maintaining, a, fairly, secular, legal, and, political, setup, replaced, the, revolutionary, council, with, a, republican, presidency, and, bicameral, parliament, removed, communist, symbols, deemed, provocative, to, the, opposition, from, the, country, s, national, emblem, dropped, the, democratic, prefix, from, the, country, s, name, offered, amnesty, to, mujahideen, fighters, and, called, for, a, six, month, ceasefire, in, which, fighting, would, stop, in, exchange, for, political, negotiations, intended, to, create, a, coalition, government, between, the, pdpa, and, various, rebel, groups, in, an, attempt, to, end, the, country, s, crisis, the, talks, did, not, succeed, in, reconciling, the, government, and, the, mujahideen, though, it, was, noted, that, they, increased, the, government, s, popularity, among, urban, areas, stabilized, the, armed, forces, and, led, to, a, round, of, defections, from, disillusioned, mujahideen, fighters, to, government, militias, despite, this, the, only, insurgent, group, to, fully, reconcile, with, the, government, was, the, shia, dominated, afghan, hizbullah, a, mujahideen, boycott, of, the, 1988, elections, which, were, the, first, ever, afghan, elections, to, allow, competing, political, parties, foiled, najibullah, s, attempt, to, reconstruct, the, nation, s, parliament, who, in, turn, ordered, 50, seats, be, left, vacant, to, offer, to, the, mujahideen, if, they, decided, to, reconcile, at, a, later, date, moreover, though, najibullah, presented, himself, personally, as, a, pious, muslim, and, restored, the, legal, status, of, islam, his, government, was, unable, to, acquire, the, same, islamic, credentials, that, the, mujahideen, forces, wielded, which, in, turn, meant, that, many, of, his, reforms, were, not, nearly, as, successful, at, convincing, the, devout, conservative, rural, and, tribal, population, as, najibullah, had, hoped, most, importantly, najibullah, oversaw, the, withdrawal, of, soviet, forces, from, afghanistan, the, withdrawal, was, to, be, done, according, to, the, geneva, accords, which, entailed, a, full, removal, of, soviet, forces, from, afghanistan, in, exchange, for, the, end, of, american, and, pakistan, support, to, the, mujahideen, throughout, the, soviet, withdrawal, from, afghanistan, troop, convoys, came, under, attack, by, afghan, rebel, fighters, in, all, 523, soviet, soldiers, were, killed, during, the, withdrawal, the, total, withdrawal, of, all, soviet, troops, from, afghanistan, was, completed, in, february, 1989, the, last, soviet, soldier, to, leave, was, lieutenant, general, boris, gromov, leader, of, the, soviet, military, operations, in, afghanistan, at, the, time, of, the, soviet, invasion, in, total, 14, 453, soviet, soldiers, died, during, the, soviet, afghan, war, though, the, soviet, forces, did, withdraw, the, mujahideen, refused, to, abide, by, the, accords, since, they, were, not, party, to, the, negotiations, furthermore, the, united, states, reneged, on, its, agreement, and, continued, funding, the, insurgent, groups, even, after, the, soviet, withdrawal, najibullah, s, government, further, complained, to, the, un, that, pakistan, had, also, continued, supplying, training, and, arming, the, rebel, forces, fighting, against, his, government, the, soviet, war, had, a, damaging, impact, on, afghanistan, the, death, of, up, to, 2, million, afghans, in, the, war, has, been, described, as, a, genocide, by, a, number, of, sources, five, to, ten, million, afghans, fled, to, pakistan, and, iran, amounting, to, 1, 3, of, the, prewar, population, of, the, country, and, another, 2, million, were, displaced, within, the, country, pakistan, s, north, west, frontier, province, functioned, as, an, organisational, and, networking, base, for, the, anti, soviet, afghan, resistance, with, the, province, s, influential, deobandi, ulama, playing, a, major, supporting, role, in, promoting, the, jihad, after, the, soviet, withdrawal, the, republic, of, afghanistan, under, najibullah, continued, to, face, resistance, from, the, various, mujahideen, forces, and, instituted, a, state, of, emergency, as, he, prepared, to, fend, off, the, armed, opposition, on, his, own, nevertheless, najibullah, received, funding, and, arms, from, the, soviet, union, until, 1991, when, the, soviet, union, collapsed, for, several, years, the, afghan, army, had, actually, increased, their, effectiveness, past, levels, ever, achieved, during, the, soviet, military, presence, the, afghan, army, was, able, to, prove, itself, in, combat, during, the, battle, of, jalalabad, in, 1989, where, it, defeated, a, major, assault, on, the, city, by, mujahideen, forces, with, u, s, and, pakistani, backing, inflicting, on, them, greater, than, 3, 000, losses, moreover, it, was, actually, able, to, go, on, the, offensive, forestalling, several, more, attacks, and, preventing, the, governmental, collapse, that, both, american, and, pakistani, policymakers, expected, this, greatly, increased, army, morale, and, demoralized, the, rebel, groups, who, had, hoped, for, a, quick, post, withdrawal, victory, in, 1990, najibullah, reformed, the, pdpa, into, the, watan, homeland, party, which, rejected, marxism, leninism, in, favour, of, leftist, afghan, nationalism, this, did, not, necessarily, have, the, desired, effect, as, it, did, not, lead, to, significant, drop, in, opposition, but, did, enrage, several, of, his, party, members, not, only, khalqists, but, also, pro, karmal, parchamites, who, accused, him, of, conceding, too, much, of, the, saur, revolution, s, gains, to, the, mujahideen, najibullah, rejected, the, accusations, stating, that, his, actions, had, been, done, in, an, attempt, to, preserve, and, protect, the, gains, of, the, revolution, not, sacrifice, them, regardless, these, reforms, caused, further, rifts, within, the, ruling, party, these, tensions, boiled, over, in, the, 1990, afghan, coup, d, tat, attempt, in, which, a, group, of, disillusioned, khalqists, led, by, defence, minister, shahnawaz, tanai, attempted, to, overthrow, najibullah, with, the, aid, of, hezb, e, islami, gulbuddin, and, external, support, from, pakistan, the, coup, failed, but, led, to, many, pro, khalqist, officers, either, fleeing, the, country, or, being, sacked, by, najibullah, considerably, weakening, the, afghan, armed, forces, the, resulting, instability, led, to, a, defeat, in, the, siege, of, khost, a, year, later, to, the, hands, of, pakistan, backed, mujahideen, forces, after, ten, years, of, heavy, fighting, another, blow, was, dealt, to, his, government, in, late, 1991, as, the, dissolution, of, the, soviet, union, signalled, the, end, of, foreign, aid, for, najibullah, s, afghanistan, as, russian, president, boris, yeltsin, had, neither, the, resources, nor, the, desire, to, aid, the, afghan, government, because, of, this, and, with, afghanistan, being, landlocked, and, not, having, a, fuel, supply, of, its, own, the, relatively, modern, and, formidable, afghan, air, force, essentially, became, grounded, by, a, lack, of, fuel, which, in, turn, made, it, all, the, more, difficult, to, supply, the, army, and, various, pro, government, militias, spread, across, afghanistan, s, harsh, geography, consequently, causing, a, considerable, increase, in, desertion, a, few, months, later, and, with, the, war, still, continuing, najibullah, offered, his, entire, government, s, resignation, and, voiced, his, support, for, a, united, nations, plan, for, a, transitional, administration, including, both, watan, and, all, mujahideen, groups, in, the, country, this, announcement, led, to, the, desertion, of, many, of, his, own, supporters, who, feared, the, end, of, his, government, in, these, circumstances, abdul, rashid, dostum, a, leading, army, general, created, an, alliance, with, the, shura, e, nazar, of, ahmad, shah, massoud, and, turned, against, najibullah, taking, with, him, over, 40, 000, previously, pro, government, soldiers, najibullah, sent, a, high, ranking, army, general, to, talk, to, dostum, and, attempt, to, salvage, the, situation, only, to, learn, that, the, general, had, also, defected, alongside, his, own, foreign, minister, these, defections, devastated, the, afghan, armed, forces, morale, and, large, parts, of, the, afghan, government, and, armed, forces, capitulated, to, the, forces, of, massoud, in, early, 1992, by, april, najibullah, stated, that, he, would, be, handing, power, to, a, seven, member, transitional, council, and, resigning, immediately, mujahideen, forces, loyal, to, massoud, and, dostum, entered, and, captured, kabul, shortly, thereafter, leading, to, the, definitive, end, of, pdpa, watan, rule, in, afghanistan, najibullah, was, granted, safety, by, the, un, office, in, kabul, he, had, obtained, political, asylum, in, india, but, was, unable, to, leave, as, he, was, prevented, from, doing, so, by, forces, loyal, to, massoud, dostum, and, hekmatyar, because, of, this, he, was, forced, to, remain, in, the, un, building, until, he, was, captured, dragged, from, a, truck, castrated, and, executed, by, the, taliban, several, years, later, after, the, soviet, defeat, the, wall, street, journal, named, massoud, the, afghan, who, won, the, cold, war, he, had, defeated, the, soviet, forces, nine, times, in, his, home, region, of, the, panjshir, valley, in, northeastern, afghanistan, pakistan, tried, to, install, gulbuddin, hekmatyar, in, power, in, afghanistan, despite, the, opposition, of, all, other, mujahideen, commanders, and, factions, as, early, as, october, 1990, the, inter, services, intelligence, had, devised, a, plan, for, hekmatyar, to, conduct, a, mass, bombardment, of, the, afghan, capital, kabul, with, possible, pakistani, troop, enforcements, this, unilateral, isi, hekmatyar, plan, came, although, the, thirty, most, important, mujahideen, commanders, had, agreed, on, holding, a, conference, inclusive, of, all, afghan, groups, to, decide, on, a, common, future, strategy, peter, tomsen, reports, that, the, protest, by, the, other, mujahideen, commanders, was, like, a, firestorm, ahmad, zia, massoud, the, brother, of, ahmad, shah, massoud, said, that, his, faction, strongly, opposed, the, plan, and, like, other, factions, would, take, measures, if, any, pakistani, troops, reinforced, hekmatyar, abdul, haq, was, reportedly, so, angry, about, the, isi, plan, that, he, was, red, in, the, face, and, nabi, mohammad, another, commander, pointed, out, that, kabul, s, 2, million, could, not, escape, hekmatyar, s, rocket, bombardment, there, would, be, a, massacre, representatives, for, massoud, haq, and, wardak, said, that, hekmatyar, s, rocketing, of, kabul, would, produce, a, civilian, bloodbath, the, united, states, finally, put, pressure, on, pakistan, to, stop, the, 1990, plan, which, was, subsequently, called, off, until, 1992, after, the, fall, of, najibullah, s, government, in, 1992, the, afghan, political, parties, agreed, on, a, power, sharing, agreement, the, peshawar, accord, the, peshawar, accord,

made, permanent, the, taliban, however, rejected, the, extension, and, relaunched, their, military, campaign, against, the, government, at, the, end, of, the, original, three, day, period, as, the,

government, which, was, not, a, party, to, the, agreement, the, deal, also, required, the, afghan, president, to, release, 5, 000, taliban, prisoners, in, exchange, for, a, taliban, release, of, 1,

until, the, 5, 000, prisoners, were, released, the, situation, led, to, an, increase, in, taliban, attacks, with, the, group, having, launched, more, than, 4, 500, attacks, on, government, forces, during, the, 45, day, period, following, the, signing, of, the, doha, agreement, a, 70, increase, compared, to, the, same, period, during, the, previous, year, as, the, u, s, had, stopped, conducting,

agreed, on, releasing, 1, 500, taliban, prisoners, so, long, as, those, prisoners, signed, a, pledge, not, to, return, to, combat, once, released, the, taliban, rejected, this, move, insisting, on, the, full, and, unconditional, release, of, the, full, 5, 000, prisoner, list, by, august, the, government, agreed, to, free, the, 5, 000, taliban, captives, but, stated, that, it, could, not, release, 400, of, them, as, they, had, been, accused, of, serious, crimes, against, civilians, calling, a, loya, jirga, to, decide, their, fate, it, ruled, in, favor, of, release, and, all, of, the, prisoners, were, freed, following, these, developments, the, first, intra, afghan, talks, between, the, taliban, and, afghan, government, were, held, in, qatar, in, april, 2021, the, newly,

fled, the, country, to, tajikistan, and, kabul, was, captured, that, same, day, with, the, entire, political, and, military, apparatus, of, the, islamic, republic, having, collapsed, the, remainder, of, the, nato, forces, in, the, country, occupied, the, hamid, karzai, international, airport, in, kabul, evacuating, hundreds, of, thousands, of, servicemen, and, civilians, in, their, last, act, while, in, afghanistan, coalition, forces, destroyed, or, damaged, most, of, what, was, left, behind, in, the, airport, to, prevent, it, from, being, used, by, the, taliban, totalling, 75, aircraft, and, over, 100, vehicles, and, other, equipment, alongside, the, airport, s, anti, air, defences, before, definitively, leaving, the, country, on, 30, august, thus, meeting, biden, s, withdrawal, deadline, biden, defended, his, decision, stating, that, he, did, not, wish, to, prolong, the, forever, war, and, blamed, the, afghan, authorities, for, not, having, found, a, political, settlement, and, fleeing, the, country, for, the, collapse, of, the, country, s, government, adding, that, the, collapse, had, nevertheless, unfolded, more, quickly, than, anticipated, according, to, biden, the, american, mission, in, the, country, had, never, been, nation, building, but, instead, a, pre, emption, of, attacks, on, the, u, s, homeland, which, he, considered, to, have, been, a, success, following, the, coalition, s, withdrawal, taliban, forces, captured, the, airport, and, announced, they, would, form, a, new, government, shortly, thereafter, despite, the, call, to, have, some,
