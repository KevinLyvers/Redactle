the, moche, civilization, spanish, pronunciation, alternatively, the, moche, culture, or, the, early, pre, or, proto, chim, flourished, in, northern, peru, with, its, capital, near, present, day, moche, trujillo, peru, from, about, 100, to, 700, ad, during, the, regional, development, epoch, while, this, issue, is, the, subject, of, some, debate, many, scholars, contend, that, the, moche, were, not, politically, organized, as, a, monolithic, empire, or, state, rather, they, were, likely, a, group, of, autonomous, polities, that, shared, a, common, culture, as, seen, in, the, rich, iconography, and, monumental, architecture, that, survives, today, moche, society, was, agriculturally, based, with, a, significant, level, of, investment, in, the, construction, of, a, sophisticated, network, of, irrigation, canals, for, the, diversion, of, river, water, to, supply, their, crops, their, artifacts, express, their, lives, with, detailed, scenes, of, hunting, fishing, fighting, sacrifice, sexual, encounters, and, elaborate, ceremonies, the, moche, are, particularly, noted, for, their, elaborately, painted, ceramics, gold, work, monumental, constructions, huacas, and, irrigation, systems, moche, history, may, be, broadly, divided, into, three, periods, the, emergence, of, the, moche, culture, in, early, moche, 100, 300, ad, the, expansion, and, flourishing, during, middle, moche, 300, 600, ad, and, the, urban, nucleation, and, subsequent, collapse, in, late, moche, 500, 750, ad, the, salinar, culture, reigned, on, the, north, coast, of, peru, from, 200, bc, 200, ad, according, to, some, scholars, this, was, a, short, transition, period, between, the, cupisnique, and, the, moche, cultures, there, are, considerable, parallels, between, moche, and, cupisnique, iconography, and, ceramic, designs, including, the, iconography, of, the, spider, god, the, moche, cultural, sphere, is, centered, on, several, valleys, on, the, north, coast, of, peru, in, regions, la, libertad, lambayeque, jequetepeque, chicama, moche, vir, chao, santa, and, nepena, it, occupied, 250, miles, of, desert, coastline, and, up, to, 50, miles, inland, the, huaca, del, sol, a, pyramidal, adobe, structure, on, the, rio, moche, was, the, largest, pre, columbian, structure, in, peru, it, was, partly, destroyed, when, spanish, conquistadors, looted, its, graves, for, gold, in, the, 16th, century, the, nearby, huaca, de, la, luna, is, better, preserved, with, many, of, its, interior, walls, still, filled, with, many, colorful, murals, and, complex, iconography, the, site, has, been, under, professional, archaeological, excavation, since, the, early, 1990s, other, major, moche, sites, include, sip, n, loma, negra, dos, cabezas, pacatnamu, the, el, brujo, complex, mocollope, cerro, mayal, galindo, huanchaco, and, pa, amarka, their, adobe, huacas, have, been, mostly, destroyed, by, looters, and, natural, forces, over, the, last, 1, 300, years, the, surviving, ones, show, that, the, coloring, of, their, murals, was, quite, vibrant, two, distinct, regions, of, the, moche, civilization, have, been, identified, southern, and, northern, moche, with, each, area, probably, corresponding, to, a, different, political, entity, the, southern, moche, region, believed, to, be, the, heartland, of, the, culture, originally, comprised, the, chicama, and, moche, valleys, and, was, first, described, by, rafael, larco, hoyle, the, huaca, del, sol, huaca, de, la, luna, site, was, probably, the, capital, of, this, region, the, northern, moche, region, includes, three, valley, systems, the, piura, was, fully, part, of, the, moche, phenomenon, only, for, a, short, time, during, its, early, moche, or, early, moche, vic, s, phase, and, then, developed, independently, it, appears, that, there, was, a, lot, of, independent, development, among, these, various, moche, centers, except, in, the, eastern, regions, they, all, likely, had, ruling, dynasties, of, their, own, related, to, each, other, centralized, control, of, the, whole, moche, area, may, have, taken, place, from, time, to, time, but, appears, infrequent, pampa, grande, in, the, lambayeque, valley, on, the, shore, of, the, chancay, river, became, one, of, the, largest, moche, sites, anywhere, and, occupied, an, area, of, more, than, 400, hectares, it, was, prominent, in, the, moche, v, period, 600, 700, ad, and, features, an, abundance, of, moche, v, ceramics, the, site, was, laid, out, and, built, in, a, short, period, of, time, and, has, an, enormous, ceremonial, complex, it, includes, huaca, fortaleza, which, is, the, tallest, ceremonial, platform, in, peru, san, jose, de, moro, is, another, northern, site, in, the, jequetepeque, valley, it, was, prominent, in, the, middle, and, late, moche, periods, 400, 850, ad, numerous, moche, tombs, have, been, excavated, here, including, several, burials, containing, high, status, female, individuals, these, women, were, depicted, in, moche, iconography, as, the, priestess, the, best, known, differences, are, moche, pottery, is, some, of, the, most, varied, in, the, world, the, use, of, mold, technology, is, evident, which, would, have, enabled, the, mass, production, of, certain, forms, but, moche, ceramics, vary, widely, in, shape, and, theme, with, most, important, social, activities, documented, in, pottery, including, war, agriculture, metalwork, weaving, and, erotica, traditional, north, coast, peruvian, ceramic, art, uses, a, limited, palette, relying, primarily, on, red, and, white, colors, fineline, painting, fully, modeled, clay, veristic, figures, and, stirrup, spouts, moche, ceramics, created, between, 150, and, 800, ad, epitomize, this, style, moche, pots, have, been, found, not, just, at, major, north, coast, archaeological, sites, such, as, huaca, de, la, luna, huaca, del, sol, and, sipan, but, also, at, small, villages, and, unrecorded, burial, sites, as, well, at, least, 500, moche, ceramics, have, sexual, themes, the, most, frequently, depicted, act, is, anal, sex, with, scenes, of, vaginal, penetration, being, very, rare, most, pairs, are, heterosexual, with, carefully, carved, genitalia, to, show, that, the, anus, rather, than, the, vagina, is, being, penetrated, often, an, infant, is, depicted, breastfeeding, while, the, couple, has, sex, fellatio, is, sometimes, represented, but, cunnilingus, is, absent, some, depict, male, skeletons, masturbating, or, being, masturbated, by, living, women, because, irrigation, was, the, source, of, wealth, and, foundation, of, the, empire, the, moche, culture, emphasized, the, importance, of, circulation, and, flow, expanding, upon, this, moche, artwork, frequently, depicted, the, passage, of, fluids, particularly, life, fluids, through, vulnerable, human, orifices, there, are, countless, images, of, defeated, warriors, losing, life, fluids, through, their, nose, or, helpless, victims, getting, their, eyes, torn, out, by, birds, or, captors, images, of, captive, sex, slaves, with, gaping, orifices, and, leaking, fluids, portray, extreme, exposure, humiliation, and, a, loss, of, power, the, coloration, of, moche, pottery, is, often, simple, with, yellowish, cream, and, rich, red, used, almost, exclusively, on, elite, pieces, white, and, black, are, rarely, used, the, moche, are, known, for, their, portraiture, pottery, the, pottery, portraits, created, by, the, moche, appear, to, represent, actual, individuals, many, of, the, portraits, are, of, individuals, with, physical, disfigurements, or, genetic, defects, the, realistic, detail, in, moche, ceramics, may, have, helped, them, serve, as, didactic, models, older, generations, could, pass, down, general, knowledge, about, reciprocity, and, embodiment, to, younger, generations, through, such, portrayals, the, sex, pots, could, teach, about, procreation, sexual, pleasure, cultural, and, social, norms, a, sort, of, immortality, the, transfer, of, life, and, souls, transformation, and, the, relationship, between, the, two, cyclical, views, of, nature, and, life, extreme, weather, and, fragility, of, garments, mean, that, relatively, few, examples, of, moche, textiles, exist, however, limited, quantities, have, been, found, in, tombs, especially, of, higher, status, members, of, society, many, of, the, remaining, garments, are, incomplete, articles, partially, broken, down, nevertheless, scholars, have, been, able, to, gain, cultural, insights, from, the, remaining, moche, textiles, the, moche, wove, textiles, mostly, using, cotton, and, wool, from, vicu, a, and, alpaca, the, relative, presence, of, these, fabrics, as, well, as, which, patterns, were, used, varies, chronologically, throughout, moche, culture, too, few, relics, exist, from, early, moche, culture, to, draw, conclusive, findings, textiles, from, around, 450, ad, uniquely, include, a, male, head, cloth, which, is, not, readily, found, elsewhere, twill, and, gauze, weaving, is, also, common, among, samples, from, this, period, though, by, the, 500, 800, ad, range, these, patterns, become, much, less, abundant, it, is, thought, that, elite, members, of, moche, society, had, specialized, artisans, who, manufactured, their, textiles, whereas, lower, ranking, typical, members, of, society, would, manufacture, their, own, clothing, whorls, and, needles, have, proven, quite, common, in, excavation, of, moche, dwellings, pointing, to, a, household, level, of, production, however, more, monochrome, homogenized, relics, suggest, mass, production, may, have, become, more, common, by, 500, 800, ad, variation, in, garments, likely, correlates, with, different, social, classes, sophisticated, weaving, techniques, and, bright, dyes, are, more, common, on, elites, clothing, whereas, commoners, may, have, had, garments, that, were, less, sophisticated, and, lacked, dye, and, they, likely, had, fewer, of, them, complex, tapestries, developed, by, artisans, are, another, good, associated, with, high, social, hierarchy, several, specific, items, also, correlate, to, gender, in, moche, culture, such, as, a, head, cloth, for, men, and, a, long, tunic, for, women, foreigners, to, the, moche, culture, were, commonly, portrayed, wearing, moche, clothing, that, contained, details, pertaining, to, both, genders, or, items, that, were, not, specific, to, either, descendants, of, moche, people, today, continue, to, have, strong, weaving, traditions, the, moche, discovered, both, electrochemical, replacement, plating, and, depletion, gilding, which, they, used, to, cover, copper, crafts, found, at, loma, negra, in, thin, layers, of, gold, or, silver, modern, attempts, were, able, to, recreate, a, similar, chemical, plating, process, using, boiling, water, and, salts, found, naturally, in, the, area, it, is, the, moche, ceramic, tradition, that, had, previously, been, given, the, most, attention, in, archaeology, though, this, is, beginning, to, change, as, archaeologists, continue, to, discover, ties, between, iconography, on, ceramic, and, other, parts, of, moche, art, just, as, important, to, moche, craftsmanship, and, culture, is, metallurgy, the, skill, required, to, create, these, objects, is, perhaps, some, of, the, finest, the, world, has, ever, known, the, first, moche, metalworks, entered, into, the, archaeological, record, were, unearthed, by, max, uhle, at, huaca, del, sol, and, huaca, de, luna, during, 1899, and, 1900, but, were, largely, ignored, while, uhle, focused, on, other, aspects, of, the, sites, moche, metal, work, gained, attention, after, peruvian, researcher, rafael, larco, hoyle, published, los, mochicas, in, 1945, here, he, mostly, focused, on, describing, the, large, flared, headdresses, and, brilliantly, decorated, nose, ornaments, often, found, in, connection, with, the, moche, elite, despite, having, no, formal, training, in, archaeology, larco, hoyle, was, the, first, to, truly, attempt, a, systematic, reconstruction, of, the, moche, by, drawing, on, information, from, excavations, art, iconography, spanish, documents, and, modern, traditions, the, discovery, of, bronze, and, gold, artifacts, buried, in, the, warrior, priest, tomb, at, the, huaca, de, la, cruz, site, one, year, later, also, encouraged, further, study, the, same, would, happen, when, burial, grounds, at, the, site, now, known, as, loma, negra, in, the, piura, valley, were, unearthed, by, looters, finding, a, wealth, of, gold, silver, and, copper, objects, along, with, ceramic, vessels, an, important, discovery, in, the, context, of, moche, metallurgy, was, the, discovery, of, the, tombs, of, sip, n, in, 1986, these, burials, included, a, wealth, of, metal, objects, unparalleled, with, any, previous, discovery, most, of, these, objects, remained, in, their, original, context, allowing, researchers, to, prove, beyond, reasonable, doubt, that, metal, objects, were, closely, intertwined, with, the, power, of, the, moche, elite, the, rulers, of, the, moche, were, incredibly, adept, at, portraying, and, perpetuating, their, power, through, art, which, is, well, exemplified, by, the, moche, metallurgy, moche, techniques, in, metalworking, have, proved, to, be, an, intriguing, area, of, research, their, techniques, were, likely, some, of, the, most, advanced, in, the, world, during, the, time, of, the, moche, restoration, has, proven, difficult, to, many, present, day, metalworkers, craftspeople, perfected, a, wide, variety, of, metalworking, techniques, when, they, invaded, in, the, sixteenth, century, spanish, conquistadors, took, note, of, the, highly, skilled, metalwork, the, inca, were, able, to, produce, unlike, european, metalworkers, the, inca, blew, through, long, tubes, to, heat, coals, rather, than, using, bellows, to, create, a, forced, draft, of, air, it, is, probable, that, the, moche, used, a, similar, method, in, fact, archaeologists, are, aware, of, several, bowls, from, the, moche, culture, that, depict, this, process, many, of, the, moche, metalworking, techniques, were, invented, or, at, least, perfected, by, the, moche, themselves, but, they, owe, the, invention, of, some, of, their, most, used, techniques, at, least, in, part, to, the, influences, of, the, chav, n, culture, that, preceded, them, like, the, artists, of, chav, n, they, mostly, used, alloys, that, contained, some, combination, of, gold, silver, or, copper, that, they, had, developed, while, moche, art, as, a, whole, is, very, much, independent, of, the, chav, n, style, many, recurring, motifs, found, across, moche, art, including, the, metalwork, also, seem, to, have, their, roots, in, chav, n, culture, moche, art, continues, the, tradition, of, anthropomorphic, figures, as, well, as, characters, with, prominent, fangs, although, the, fangs, are, usually, less, pronounced, than, chav, n, art, and, not, present, quite, as, often, that, is, not, to, say, that, the, moche, did, not, leave, their, own, mark, on, the, anden, society, many, of, the, techniques, developed, by, the, moche, especially, their, electroplating, and, gilding, techniques, used, to, make, copper, alloys, appear, to, be, almost, internally, gold, or, silver, would, continue, to, be, used, up, until, the, inca, conquest, hundreds, of, years, after, the, moche, s, collapse, several, examples, of, the, molds, used, to, shape, the, low, relief, sculptures, have, been, discovered, most, are, made, of, a, solid, metal, alloy, but, wood, molds, were, also, used, researchers, christopher, b, donnan, and, david, a, scott, proved, how, delicate, this, process, of, shaping, is, when, they, used, a, cast, of, one, of, the, copper, alloy, molds, to, recreate, the, process, they, found, one, of, the, most, important, parts, of, the, process, is, the, thickness, of, the, sheet, metal, too, thick, and, it, will, fail, to, capture, the, details, of, the, mold, and, prove, too, difficult, to, shape, but, too, thin, and, the, metal, would, winkle, and, tear, they, found, 0, 4mm, to, be, the, ideal, thickness, although, the, repeated, hammering, thinned, the, sheet, down, to, 0, 25mm, in, addition, to, hammering, repeated, annealing, was, also, required, analysis, of, the, items, found, at, the, tombs, of, sipan, has, found, that, the, moche, were, able, to, maintain, an, almost, completely, uniform, thickness, between, 1, and, about, 0, 1, millimeters, depending, on, the, object, when, this, was, completed, several, other, techniques, could, be, used, to, finish, the, piece, oftentimes, other, pieces, were, attached, sometimes, with, the, intention, of, being, moving, parts, of, the, work, more, often, than, not, this, was, done, by, crimping, the, metal, or, the, use, of, interlocking, tabs, and, slits, in, the, two, parts, but, soldering, and, edged, wielding, were, also, used, finishing, touches, could, also, be, added, with, embossing, punching, and, chasing, along, with, embedding, other, precious, materials, stones, such, as, lapis, lazuli, turquoise, spondylus, shells, and, others, have, all, been, found, embedded, in, moche, metal, works, it, is, worth, noting, that, several, of, the, materials, are, not, found, on, the, moche, coast, lapis, lazuli, was, available, only, from, modern, chile, hundreds, of, miles, to, the, south, and, spondulus, shells, had, to, be, acquired, from, modern, ecuador, to, the, north, this, makes, it, clear, that, the, moche, must, have, had, extensive, trade, networks, and, likely, contact, with, other, cultures, also, notable, in, this, context, is, the, fact, that, many, of, the, animals, accurately, depicted, in, moche, artwork, are, found, only, in, the, tropical, amazon, researchers, of, the, moche, culture, agree, that, the, emergence, of, the, moche, culture, is, related, to, the, intensification, of, the, production, of, corn, cotton, beans, and, squash, among, other, agricultural, products, which, allowed, the, development, of, a, regional, moche, political, economy, in, the, valley, of, moche, from, the, north, coast, of, peru, during, the, early, intermediate, period, 400, bc, 600, ad, the, northern, region, of, peru, is, one, of, the, most, arid, areas, in, the, world, where, there, is, no, rain, throughout, the, year, that, factor, far, from, discouraging, the, establishment, of, communities, was, the, trigger, for, the, construction, of, an, outstanding, culture, that, developed, engineering, works, that, interconnected, various, river, valleys, with, the, aim, of, irrigating, desert, territories, many, of, the, moche, agricultural, systems, are, still, in, operation, such, as, the, ascope, aqueduct, the, la, cumbre, canal, in, chicama, or, the, san, jose, dam, which, continue, to, provide, water, coming, from, the, andean, region, and, groundwater, guaranteeing, several, harvests, per, year, access, to, new, farmland, gained, from, the, desert, was, the, starting, point, of, a, civilization, that, based, on, abundant, harvests, became, socially, stratified, all, this, allowed, certain, members, of, the, community, to, no, longer, dedicate, themselves, exclusively, to, food, production, and, a, process, of, specialization, began, that, led, to, the, development, of, the, moche, civilization, both, iconography, and, the, finds, of, human, skeletons, in, ritual, contexts, seem, to, indicate, that, human, sacrifice, played, a, significant, part, in, moche, religious, practices, these, rites, appear, to, have, involved, the, elite, as, key, actors, in, a, spectacle, of, costumed, participants, monumental, settings, and, possibly, the, ritual, consumption, of, blood, the, tumi, was, a, crescent, shaped, metal, knife, used, in, sacrifices, while, some, scholars, such, as, christopher, b, donnan, and, izumi, shimada, argue, that, the, sacrificial, victims, were, the, losers, of, ritual, battles, among, local, elites, others, such, as, john, verano, and, richard, sutter, suggest, that, the, sacrificial, victims, were, warriors, captured, in, territorial, battles, between, the, moche, and, other, nearby, societies, excavations, in, plazas, near, moche, huacas, have, found, groups, of, people, sacrificed, together, and, the, skeletons, of, young, men, deliberately, excarnated, perhaps, for, temple, displays, the, moche, may, have, also, held, and, tortured, the, victims, for, several, weeks, before, sacrificing, them, with, the, intent, of, deliberately, drawing, blood, verano, believes, that, some, parts, of, the, victim, may, have, been, eaten, as, well, in, ritual, cannibalism, the, sacrifices, may, have, been, associated, with, rites, of, ancestral, renewal, and, agricultural, fertility, moche, iconography, features, a, figure, which, scholars, have, nicknamed, the, decapitator, it, is, frequently, depicted, as, a, spider, but, sometimes, as, a, winged, creature, or, a, sea, monster, together, all, three, features, symbolize, land, water, and, air, when, the, body, is, included, the, figure, is, usually, shown, with, one, arm, holding, a, knife, and, another, holding, a, severed, head, by, the, hair, it, has, also, been, depicted, as, a, human, figure, with, a, tiger, s, mouth, and, snarling, fangs, the, decapitator, is, thought, to, have, figured, prominently, in, the, beliefs, surrounding, the, practice, of, sacrifice, although, it, remains, somewhat, unclear, how, geographically, divided, moche, culture, was, scholars, are, very, confident, that, the, moche, were, a, socially, divided, society, beyond, royalty, the, moche, can, be, divided, into, a, general, upper, and, lower, class, and, each, class, can, be, further, stratified, into, smaller, groups, intra, class, movement, was, possible, within, these, broad, categories, but, inter, class, switches, between, them, were, less, feasible, many, pre, contact, cultures, share, a, divided, structure, comparable, to, the, moche, but, each, may, have, unique, development, although, religion, seems, to, have, been, a, centripetal, force, for, the, moche, members, of, the, elite, class, likely, used, it, to, reinforce, their, status, other, ideological, economic, political, and, social, factors, may, have, also, been, leveraged, to, similar, ends, a, common, approach, to, maintaining, power, was, for, members, of, the, elite, such, as, priests, and, priestesses, to, use, ceremonies, to, reinforce, their, standing, see, the, religion, section, for, more, information, on, ceremonies, it, may, also, be, true, that, physical, force, was, used, the, moche, elite, may, have, struggled, to, retain, power, at, times, and, inter, elite, quarreling, is, speculated, to, have, played, into, the, culture, s, collapse, excavated, moche, burial, sites, constitute, a, large, body, of, evidence, for, social, stratification, those, lowest, in, the, moche, hierarchy, were, buried, in, a, simple, hole, near, their, household, platform, mounds, with, an, abundance, of, goods, were, awarded, to, the, highest, ranking, members, of, society, an, incomplete, list, of, possible, funerary, objects, includes, copper, masks, silver, pottery, and, gold, goods, presence, of, metal, worked, goods, is, thought, to, be, especially, significant, with, respect, to, high, status, excavation, of, dwellings, indicates, that, living, conditions, of, moche, likely, also, differed, based, on, social, standing, but, excavation, data, here, remains, skewed, and, not, entirely, complete, so, far, excavated, elite, burials, also, illustrate, that, remains, sexed, both, male, and, female, held, elite, positions, in, moche, culture, there, are, multiple, theories, as, to, what, caused, the, demise, of, the, moche, political, structure, some, scholars, have, emphasized, the, role, of, environmental, change, studies, of, ice, cores, drilled, from, glaciers, in, the, andes, reveal, climatic, events, between, 563, and, 594, ad, possibly, a, super, el, ni, o, that, resulted, in, 30, years, of, intense, rain, and, flooding, followed, by, 30, years, of, drought, part, of, the, aftermath, of, the, climate, changes, of, 535, 536, these, weather, events, could, have, disrupted, the, moche, way, of, life, political, hierarchy, and, jeopardized, their, faith, in, their, religion, this, super, el, ni, o, may, have, hindered, moche, agriculture, moche, agriculture, relied, considerably, on, canal, based, irrigation, from, andes, mountain, runoff, which, a, severe, drought, would, have, jeopardized, certain, scholars, attribute, strain, on, the, irrigation, systems, to, sensitive, tectonics, in, the, region, other, evidence, demonstrates, that, these, events, did, not, cause, a, complete, moche, demise, moche, polities, survived, beyond, 650, ad, in, the, jequetepeque, valley, and, the, moche, valleys, for, instance, in, the, jequetepeque, valley, later, settlements, are, characterized, by, fortifications, and, defensive, works, while, there, is, no, evidence, of, a, foreign, invasion, i, e, a, huari, invasion, as, many, scholars, have, suggested, in, the, past, the, defensive, works, suggest, social, unrest, possibly, the, result, of, climatic, changes, as, factions, fought, for, control, over, increasingly, scarce, resources, chronologically, the, moche, was, an, early, intermediate, period, culture, which, was, preceded, by, the, chav, n, horizon, as, well, as, the, cupisnique, and, succeeded, by, the, huari, and, chim, the, moche, co, existed, with, the, ica, nazca, culture, in, the, south, they, are, thought, to, have, had, some, limited, contact, with, the, ica, nazca, because, they, later, mined, guano, for, fertilizer, and, may, have, traded, with, northerners, moche, pottery, has, been, found, near, ica, but, no, ica, nazca, pottery, has, been, found, in, moche, territory, the, coastal, moche, culture, also, co, existed, or, overlapped, in, time, with, the, slightly, earlier, recuay, culture, in, the, highlands, some, moche, iconographic, motifs, can, be, traced, to, recuay, design, elements, the, moche, also, interacted, with, the, neighbouring, vir, culture, eventually, by, 700, ce, they,
