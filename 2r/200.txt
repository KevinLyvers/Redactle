the, migration, period, circa, 300, to, 600, ad, also, known, as, the, barbarian, invasions, was, a, period, in, european, history, marked, by, large, scale, migrations, that, saw, the, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, and, subsequent, settlement, of, its, former, territories, by, various, tribes, and, the, establishment, of, the, post, roman, kingdoms, the, term, refers, to, the, important, role, played, by, the, migration, invasion, and, settlement, of, various, tribes, notably, the, franks, goths, alemanni, alans, huns, early, slavs, pannonian, avars, bulgars, and, magyars, within, or, into, the, territories, of, the, roman, empire, and, europe, as, a, whole, the, period, is, traditionally, taken, to, have, begun, in, ad, 375, possibly, as, early, as, 300, and, ended, in, 568, various, factors, contributed, to, this, phenomenon, of, migration, and, invasion, and, their, role, and, significance, are, still, widely, discussed, historians, differ, as, to, the, dates, for, the, beginning, and, ending, of, the, migration, period, the, beginning, of, the, period, is, widely, regarded, as, the, invasion, of, europe, by, the, huns, from, asia, in, about, 375, and, the, ending, with, the, conquest, of, italy, by, the, lombards, in, 568, but, a, more, loosely, set, period, is, from, as, early, as, 300, to, as, late, as, 800, for, example, in, the, 4th, century, a, very, large, group, of, goths, was, settled, as, foederati, within, the, roman, balkans, and, the, franks, were, settled, south, of, the, rhine, in, roman, gaul, in, 406, a, particularly, large, and, unexpected, crossing, of, the, rhine, was, made, by, a, group, of, vandals, alans, and, suebi, as, central, power, broke, down, in, the, western, roman, empire, the, military, became, more, important, but, was, dominated, by, men, of, barbarian, origin, there, are, contradictory, opinions, as, to, whether, the, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, was, a, result, of, an, increase, in, migrations, or, if, both, the, breakdown, of, central, power, and, the, increased, importance, of, non, romans, created, additional, internal, factors, migrations, and, the, use, of, non, romans, in, the, military, were, known, in, the, periods, before, and, after, and, the, eastern, roman, empire, adapted, and, continued, to, exist, until, the, fall, of, constantinople, to, the, ottomans, in, 1453, the, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, although, it, involved, the, establishment, of, competing, barbarian, kingdoms, was, to, some, extent, managed, by, the, eastern, emperors, the, migrants, comprised, war, bands, or, tribes, of, 10, 000, to, 20, 000, people, immigration, was, common, throughout, the, time, of, the, roman, empire, but, over, the, course, of, 100, years, the, migrants, numbered, not, more, than, 750, 000, in, total, compared, to, an, average, 40, million, population, of, the, roman, empire, at, that, time, the, first, migrations, of, peoples, were, made, by, germanic, tribes, such, as, the, goths, including, the, visigoths, and, the, ostrogoths, the, vandals, the, anglo, saxons, the, lombards, the, suebi, the, frisii, the, jutes, the, burgundians, the, alemanni, the, sciri, and, the, franks, they, were, later, pushed, westward, by, the, huns, the, avars, the, slavs, and, the, bulgars, later, invasions, such, as, the, vikings, the, normans, the, varangians, the, hungarians, the, arabs, the, turks, and, the, mongols, also, had, significant, effects, especially, in, north, africa, the, iberian, peninsula, anatolia, and, central, and, eastern, europe, germanic, peoples, moved, out, of, southern, scandinavia, and, northern, germany, to, the, adjacent, lands, between, the, elbe, and, oder, after, 1000, bc, the, first, wave, moved, westward, and, southward, pushing, the, resident, celts, west, to, the, rhine, around, 200, bc, moving, into, southern, germany, up, to, the, roman, provinces, of, gaul, and, cisalpine, gaul, by, 100, bc, where, they, were, stopped, by, gaius, marius, and, later, by, julius, caesar, it, is, this, western, group, which, was, described, by, the, roman, historian, tacitus, ad, 56, 117, and, julius, caesar, 100, 44, bc, a, later, wave, of, germanic, tribes, migrated, eastward, and, southward, from, scandinavia, between, 600, and, 300, bc, to, the, opposite, coast, of, the, baltic, sea, moving, up, the, vistula, near, the, carpathian, mountains, during, tacitus, era, they, included, lesser, known, tribes, such, as, the, tencteri, cherusci, hermunduri, and, chatti, however, a, period, of, federation, and, intermarriage, resulted, in, the, familiar, groups, known, as, the, alemanni, franks, saxons, frisians, and, thuringians, the, first, wave, of, invasions, between, ad, 300, and, 500, is, partly, documented, by, greek, and, latin, historians, but, is, difficult, to, verify, archaeologically, it, puts, germanic, peoples, in, control, of, most, areas, of, what, was, then, the, western, roman, empire, the, tervingi, crossed, the, danube, into, roman, territory, in, 376, in, a, migration, fleeing, the, invading, huns, some, time, later, in, marcianopolis, the, escort, to, their, leader, fritigern, was, killed, while, meeting, with, roman, commander, lupicinus, the, tervingi, rebelled, and, the, visigoths, a, group, derived, either, from, the, tervingi, or, from, a, fusion, of, mainly, gothic, groups, eventually, invaded, italy, and, sacked, rome, in, 410, before, settling, in, gaul, around, 460, they, founded, the, visigothic, kingdom, in, iberia, they, were, followed, into, roman, territory, first, by, a, confederation, of, herulian, rugian, and, scirian, warriors, under, odoacer, that, deposed, romulus, augustulus, in, 476, and, later, by, the, ostrogoths, led, by, theodoric, the, great, who, settled, in, italy, in, gaul, the, franks, a, fusion, of, western, germanic, tribes, whose, leaders, had, been, aligned, with, rome, since, the, 3rd, century, entered, roman, lands, gradually, during, the, 5th, century, and, after, consolidating, power, under, childeric, and, his, son, clovis, s, decisive, victory, over, syagrius, in, 486, established, themselves, as, rulers, of, northern, roman, gaul, fending, off, challenges, from, the, alemanni, burgundians, and, visigoths, the, frankish, kingdom, became, the, nucleus, of, what, would, later, become, france, and, germany, the, initial, anglo, saxon, settlement, of, britain, occurred, during, the, 5th, century, when, roman, control, of, britain, had, come, to, an, end, the, burgundians, settled, in, northwestern, italy, switzerland, and, eastern, france, in, the, 5th, century, between, ad, 500, and, 700, slavic, tribes, settled, more, areas, of, central, europe, and, pushed, farther, into, southern, and, eastern, europe, gradually, making, the, eastern, half, of, europe, predominantly, slavic, additionally, turkic, tribes, such, as, the, avars, and, later, ugric, magyars, became, involved, in, this, second, wave, in, ad, 567, the, avars, and, the, lombards, destroyed, much, of, the, gepid, kingdom, the, lombards, a, germanic, people, settled, in, italy, with, their, herulian, suebian, gepid, thuringian, bulgar, sarmatian, and, saxon, allies, in, the, 6th, century, they, were, later, followed, by, the, bavarians, and, the, franks, who, conquered, and, ruled, most, of, italy, the, bulgars, originally, a, nomadic, group, probably, from, central, asia, occupied, the, pontic, steppe, north, of, caucasus, since, the, 2nd, century, but, later, pushed, by, the, khazars, the, majority, of, them, migrated, west, and, dominated, byzantine, territories, along, the, lower, danube, in, the, 7th, century, from, that, time, the, demographic, picture, of, the, balkans, changed, permanently, becoming, predominantly, slavic, while, pockets, of, native, people, survived, in, the, mountains, of, the, balkans, croats, settled, in, modern, croatia, and, western, bosnia, bringing, with, them, the, serbs, who, settled, in, rascia, an, area, around, montenegro, south, west, serbia, by, the, mid, seventh, century, serb, tribes, were, invading, northern, albania, by, the, ninth, century, the, central, balkans, corresponding, to, modern, kosovo, serbia, and, macedonia, and, the, area, of, southern, and, central, albania, became, invaded, and, settled, by, bulgars, during, the, early, byzantine, arab, wars, arab, armies, attempted, to, invade, southeast, europe, via, asia, minor, during, the, late, 7th, and, early, 8th, centuries, but, were, defeated, at, the, siege, of, constantinople, 717, 718, by, the, joint, forces, of, byzantium, and, the, bulgars, during, the, khazar, arab, wars, the, khazars, stopped, the, arab, expansion, into, europe, across, the, caucasus, 7th, and, 8th, centuries, at, the, same, time, the, moors, consisting, of, arabs, and, berbers, invaded, europe, via, gibraltar, conquering, hispania, from, the, visigothic, kingdom, in, 711, before, being, halted, by, the, franks, at, the, battle, of, tours, in, gaul, these, battles, broadly, demarcated, the, frontiers, between, christendom, and, islam, for, the, next, millennium, the, following, centuries, saw, the, muslims, successful, in, conquering, most, of, sicily, from, the, christians, by, 902, the, hungarian, conquest, of, the, carpathian, basin, from, around, ad, 895, and, the, subsequent, hungarian, invasions, of, europe, and, the, viking, expansion, from, the, late, 8th, century, conventionally, mark, the, last, large, movements, of, the, period, christian, missionaries, gradually, converted, the, non, islamic, newcomers, and, integrated, them, into, the, christendom, analysis, of, barbarian, identity, and, how, it, was, created, and, expressed, during, the, barbarian, invasions, has, elicited, discussion, among, scholars, herwig, wolfram, a, historian, of, the, goths, in, discussing, the, equation, of, migratio, gentium, with, v, lkerwanderung, observes, that, michael, schmidt, introduced, the, equation, in, his, 1778, history, of, the, germans, wolfram, observed, that, the, significance, of, gens, as, a, biological, community, was, shifting, even, during, the, early, middle, ages, and, that, to, complicate, matters, we, have, no, way, of, devising, a, terminology, that, is, not, derived, from, the, concept, of, nationhood, created, during, the, french, revolution, the, primordialistic, paradigm, prevailed, during, the, 19th, century, scholars, such, as, german, linguist, johann, gottfried, herder, viewed, tribes, as, coherent, biological, racial, entities, using, the, term, to, refer, to, discrete, ethnic, groups, he, also, believed, that, the, volk, were, an, organic, whole, with, a, core, identity, and, spirit, evident, in, art, literature, and, language, these, characteristics, were, seen, as, intrinsic, unaffected, by, external, influences, even, conquest, language, in, particular, was, seen, as, the, most, important, expression, of, ethnicity, they, argued, that, groups, sharing, the, same, or, similar, language, possessed, a, common, identity, and, ancestry, this, was, the, romantic, ideal, that, there, once, had, been, a, single, german, celtic, or, slavic, people, who, originated, from, a, common, homeland, and, spoke, a, common, tongue, helping, to, provide, a, conceptual, framework, for, political, movements, of, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, such, as, pan, germanism, and, pan, slavism, from, the, 1960s, a, reinterpretation, of, archaeological, and, historical, evidence, prompted, scholars, such, as, goffart, and, todd, to, propose, new, models, for, explaining, the, construction, of, barbarian, identity, they, maintained, that, no, sense, of, shared, identity, was, perceived, by, the, germani, a, similar, theory, having, been, proposed, for, celtic, and, slavic, groups, a, theory, states, that, the, primordialist, mode, of, thinking, was, encouraged, by, a, prima, facie, interpretation, of, graeco, roman, sources, which, grouped, together, many, tribes, under, such, labels, as, germanoi, keltoi, or, sclavenoi, thus, encouraging, their, perception, as, distinct, peoples, modernists, argue, that, the, uniqueness, perceived, by, specific, groups, was, based, on, common, political, and, economic, interests, rather, than, biological, or, racial, distinctions, indeed, on, this, basis, some, schools, of, thought, in, recent, scholarship, urge, that, the, concept, of, germanic, peoples, be, jettisoned, altogether, the, role, of, language, in, constructing, and, maintaining, group, identity, can, be, ephemeral, since, large, scale, language, shifts, occur, commonly, in, history, modernists, propose, the, idea, of, imagined, communities, the, barbarian, polities, in, late, antiquity, were, social, constructs, rather, than, unchanging, lines, of, blood, kinship, the, process, of, forming, tribal, units, was, called, ethnogenesis, a, term, coined, by, soviet, scholar, yulian, bromley, the, austrian, school, led, by, reinhard, wenskus, popularized, this, idea, which, influenced, medievalists, such, as, herwig, wolfram, walter, pohl, and, patrick, j, geary, it, argues, that, the, stimulus, for, forming, tribal, polities, was, perpetuated, by, a, small, nucleus, of, people, known, as, the, traditionskern, kernel, of, tradition, who, were, a, military, or, aristocratic, elite, this, core, group, formed, a, standard, for, larger, units, gathering, adherents, by, employing, amalgamative, metaphors, such, as, kinship, and, aboriginal, commonality, and, claiming, that, they, perpetuated, an, ancient, divinely, sanctioned, lineage, the, common, track, filled, map, of, the, v, lkerwanderung, may, illustrate, such, course, of, events, but, it, misleads, unfolded, over, long, periods, of, time, the, changes, of, position, that, took, place, were, necessarily, irregular, with, periods, of, emphatic, discontinuity, for, decades, and, possibly, centuries, the, tradition, bearers, idled, and, the, tradition, itself, hibernated, there, was, ample, time, for, forgetfulness, to, do, its, work, v, lkerwanderung, is, a, german, word, borrowed, from, german, historiography, that, refers, to, the, early, migrations, of, the, germanic, peoples, in, a, broader, sense, it, can, mean, the, mass, migration, of, whole, tribes, or, ethnic, groups, rather, than, invasion, german, and, slavic, scholars, speak, of, migration, see, german, v, lkerwanderung, czech, st, hov, n, n, rod, swedish,

historiography, translate, to, barbarian, invasions, or, even, barbaric, invasions, french, invasions, barbares, italian, invasioni, barbariche, historians, have, postulated, several, explanations, for, the, appearance, of, barbarians, on, the, roman, frontier, climate, change, weather, and, crops, population, pressure, a, primeval, urge, to, push, into, the, mediterranean, the, construction, of, the, great, wall, of, china, causing, a, domino, effect, of, tribes, being, forced, westward, leading, to, the, huns, falling, upon, the, goths, who, in, turn, pushed, other, germanic, tribes, before, them, in, general, french, and, italian, scholars, have, tended, to, view, this, as, a, catastrophic, event, the, destruction, of, a, civilization, and, the, beginning, of, a, dark, age, that, set, europe, back, a, millennium, in, contrast, german, and, english, historians, have, tended, to, see, roman, barbarian, interaction, as, the, replacement, of, a, tired, effete, and, decadent, mediterranean, civilization, with, a, more, virile, martial, nordic, one, the, scholar, guy, halsall, has, seen, the, barbarian, movement, as, the, result, of, the, fall, of, the, roman, empire, not, its, cause, archaeological, discoveries, have, confirmed, that, germanic, and, slavic, tribes, were, settled, agriculturalists, who, were, probably, merely, drawn, into, the, politics, of, an, empire, already, falling, apart, for, quite, a, few, other, causes, goffart, argues, that, the, process, of, settlement, was, connected, to, hospitalitas, the, roman, practice, of, quartering, soldiers, among, the, civilian, population, the, romans, by, granting, land, and, the, right, to, levy, taxes, to, allied, germanic, armies, hoped, to, reduce, the, financial, burdens, of, the, empire, the, crisis, of, the, third, century, caused, significant, changes, within, the, roman, empire, in, both, its, western, and, its, eastern, portions, in, particular, economic, fragmentation, removed, many, of, the, political, cultural, and, economic, forces, that, had, held, the, empire, together, the, rural, population, in, roman, provinces, became, distanced, from, the, metropolis, and, there, was, little, to, differentiate, them, from, other, peasants, across, the, roman, frontier, in, addition, rome, increasingly, used, foreign, mercenaries, to, defend, itself, that, barbarisation, parallelled, changes, within, barbaricum, to, this, end, noted, linguist, dennis, howard, green, wrote, the, first, centuries, of, our, era, witness, not, merely, a, progressive, romanisation, of, barbarian, society, but, also, an, undeniable, barbarisation, of, the, roman, world, for, example, the, roman, empire, played, a, vital, role, in, building, up, barbarian, groups, along, its, frontier, propped, up, with, imperial, support, and, gifts, the, armies, of, allied, barbarian, chieftains, served, as, buffers, against, other, hostile, barbarian, groups, the, disintegration, of, roman, economic, power, weakened, groups, that, had, come, to, depend, on, roman, gifts, for, the, maintenance, of, their, own, power, the, arrival, of, the, huns, helped, prompt, many, groups, to, invade, the, provinces, for, economic, reasons, the, nature, of, the, barbarian, takeover, of, former, roman, provinces, varied, from, region, to, region, for, example, in, aquitaine, the, provincial, administration, was, largely, self, reliant, halsall, has, argued, that, local, rulers, simply, handed, over, military, rule, to, the, ostrogoths, acquiring, the, identity, of, the, newcomers, in, gaul, the, collapse, of, imperial, rule, resulted, in, anarchy, the, franks, and, alemanni, were, pulled, into, the, ensuing, power, vacuum, resulting, in, conflict, in, spain, local, aristocrats, maintained, independent, rule, for, some, time, raising, their, own, armies, against, the, vandals, meanwhile, the, roman, withdrawal, from, lowland, england, resulted, in, conflict, between, saxons, and, the, brittonic, chieftains, whose, centres, of, power, retreated, westward, as, a, result, the, eastern, roman, empire, attempted, to, maintain, control, of, the, balkan, provinces, despite, a, thinly, spread, imperial, army, relying, mainly, on, local, militias, and, an, extensive, effort, to, refortify, the, danubian, limes, the, ambitious, fortification, efforts, collapsed, worsening, the, impoverished, conditions, of, the, local, populace, and, resulting, in, colonization, by, slavic, warriors, and, their, families, halsall, and, noble, have, argued, that, such, changes, stemmed, from, the, breakdown, in, roman, political, control, which, exposed, the, weakness, of, local, roman, rule, instead, of, large, scale, migrations, there, were, military, takeovers, by, small, groups, of, warriors, and, their, families, who, usually, numbered, only, in, the, tens, of, thousands, the, process, involved, active, conscious, decision, making, by, roman, provincial, populations, the, collapse, of, centralized, control, severely, weakened, the, sense, of, roman, identity, in, the, provinces, which, may, explain, why, the, provinces, then, underwent, dramatic, cultural, changes, even, though, few, barbarians, settled, in, them, ultimately, the, germanic, groups, in, the, western, roman, empire, were, accommodated, without, dispossessing, or, overturning, indigenous, society, and, they, maintained, a, structured, and, hierarchical, but, attenuated, form, of, roman, administration, ironically, they, lost, their, unique, identity, as, a, result, of, such, an, accommodation, and, were, absorbed, into, latinhood, in, contrast, in, the, east, slavic, tribes, maintained, a, more, spartan, and, egalitarian, existence, bound, to, the, land, even, in, times, when, they, took, their, part, in, plundering, roman, provinces, their, organizational, models, were, not, roman, and, their, leaders, were, not, normally, dependent, on, roman, gold, for, success, thus, they, arguably, had, a, greater, effect, on, their, region, than, the, goths, the, franks, or, the, saxons, had, on, theirs, based, on, the, belief, that, particular, types, of, artifacts, elements, of, personal, adornment, generally, found, in, a, funerary, context, are, thought, to, indicate, the, ethnicity, of, the, person, buried, the, culture, history, school, of, archaeology, assumed, that, archaeological, cultures, represent, the, urheimat, homeland, of, tribal, polities, named, in, historical, sources, as, a, consequence, the, shifting, extensions, of, material, cultures, were, interpreted, as, the, expansion, of, peoples, influenced, by, constructionism, process, driven, archaeologists, rejected, the, culture, historical, doctrine, and, marginalized, the, discussion, of, ethnicity, altogether, and, focused, on, the, intragroup, dynamics, that, generated, such, material, remains, moreover, they, argued, that, adoption, of, new, cultures, could, occur, through, trade, or, internal, political, developments, rather, than, only, military, takeovers
