feudalism, also, known, as, the, feudal, system, was, a, combination, of, legal, economic, military, cultural, and, political, customs, that, flourished, in, medieval, europe, from, the, 9th, to, 15th, centuries, broadly, defined, it, was, a, way, of, structuring, society, around, relationships, derived, from, the, holding, of, land, in, exchange, for, service, or, labour, the, classic, definition, by, fran, ois, louis, ganshof, 1944, describes, a, set, of, reciprocal, legal, and, military, obligations, of, the, warrior, nobility, and, revolved, around, the, key, concepts, of, lords, vassals, and, fiefs, a, broader, definition, as, described, by, marc, bloch, 1939, includes, not, only, the, obligations, of, the, warrior, nobility, but, the, obligations, of, all, three, estates, of, the, realm, the, nobility, the, clergy, and, the, peasantry, all, of, whom, were, bound, by, a, system, of, manorialism, this, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, feudal, society, although, it, is, derived, from, the, latin, word, feodum, or, feudum, fief, which, was, used, during, the, medieval, period, the, term, feudalism, and, the, system, it, describes, were, not, conceived, of, as, a, formal, political, system, by, the, people, who, lived, during, the, middle, ages, since, the, publication, of, elizabeth, a, r, brown, s, the, tyranny, of, a, construct, 1974, and, susan, reynolds, s, fiefs, and, vassals, 1994, there, has, been, ongoing, inconclusive, discussion, among, medieval, historians, as, to, whether, feudalism, is, a, useful, construct, for, understanding, medieval, society, the, adjective, feudal, was, in, use, by, at, least, 1405, and, the, noun, feudalism, was, in, use, by, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, paralleling, the, french, f, odalit, according, to, a, classic, definition, by, fran, ois, louis, ganshof, 1944, feudalism, describes, a, set, of, reciprocal, legal, and, military, obligations, of, the, warrior, nobility, that, revolved, around, the, key, concepts, of, lords, vassals, and, fiefs, though, ganshof, himself, noted, that, his, treatment, was, only, related, to, the, narrow, technical, legal, sense, of, the, word, a, broader, definition, as, described, in, marc, bloch, s, feudal, society, 1939, includes, not, only, the, obligations, of, the, warrior, nobility, but, the, obligations, of, all, three, estates, of, the, realm, the, nobility, the, clergy, and, those, who, lived, off, their, labour, most, directly, the, peasantry, which, was, bound, by, a, system, of, manorialism, this, order, is, often, referred, to, as, a, feudal, society, echoing, bloch, s, usage, outside, its, european, context, the, concept, of, feudalism, can, be, extended, to, analogous, social, structures, in, other, regions, most, often, in, discussions, of, feudal, japan, under, the, shoguns, and, sometimes, in, discussions, of, the, zagwe, dynasty, in, medieval, ethiopia, which, had, some, feudal, characteristics, sometimes, called, semifeudal, some, have, taken, the, feudalism, analogy, further, seeing, feudalism, or, traces, of, it, in, places, as, diverse, as, spring, and, autumn, period, china, ancient, egypt, the, parthian, empire, india, until, the, mughal, dynasty, and, the, antebellum, south, and, jim, crow, laws, in, the, american, south, the, term, feudalism, has, also, been, applied, often, pejoratively, to, non, western, societies, where, institutions, and, attitudes, similar, to, those, in, medieval, europe, are, perceived, to, prevail, some, historians, and, political, theorists, believe, that, the, term, feudalism, has, been, deprived, of, specific, meaning, by, the, many, ways, it, has, been, used, leading, them, to, reject, it, as, a, useful, concept, for, understanding, society, the, applicability, of, the, term, feudalism, has, also, been, questioned, in, the, context, of, some, central, and, eastern, european, countries, such, as, poland, and, lithuania, with, scholars, observing, that, the, medieval, political, and, economic, structure, of, those, countries, bears, some, but, not, all, resemblances, to, the, western, european, societies, commonly, described, as, feudal, the, word, feudal, comes, from, the, medieval, latin, feud, lis, the, adjectival, form, of, feudum, fee, feud, first, attested, in, a, charter, of, charles, the, fat, in, 884, which, is, related, to, old, french, f, fi, proven, al, feo, feu, fieu, and, italian, fio, the, ultimate, origin, of, feud, lis, is, unclear, it, may, come, from, a, germanic, word, perhaps, fehu, or, feh, d, but, these, words, are, not, attested, in, this, meaning, in, germanic, sources, or, even, in, the, latin, of, the, frankish, laws, one, theory, about, the, origin, of, fehu, was, proposed, by, johan, hendrik, caspar, kern, in, 1870, being, supported, by, amongst, others, william, stubbs, and, marc, bloch, kern, derived, the, word, from, a, putative, frankish, term, fehu, d, in, which, fehu, means, cattle, and, d, means, goods, implying, a, movable, object, of, value, bloch, explains, that, by, the, beginning, of, the, 10th, century, it, was, common, to, value, land, in, monetary, terms, but, to, pay, for, it, with, objects, of, equivalent, value, such, as, arms, clothing, horses, or, food, this, was, known, as, feos, a, term, that, took, on, the, general, meaning, of, paying, for, something, in, lieu, of, money, this, meaning, was, then, applied, to, land, itself, in, which, land, was, used, to, pay, for, fealty, such, as, to, a, vassal, thus, the, old, word, feos, meaning, movable, property, would, have, changed, to, feus, meaning, the, exact, opposite, landed, property, archibald, ross, lewis, proposes, that, the, origin, of, fief, is, not, feudum, or, feodum, but, rather, foderum, the, earliest, attested, use, being, in, vita, hludovici, 840, by, astronomus, in, that, text, is, a, passage, about, louis, the, pious, that, says, annona, militaris, quas, vulgo, foderum, vocant, which, can, be, translated, as, louis, forbade, that, military, provender, which, they, popularly, call, fodder, be, furnished, initially, in, medieval, latin, european, documents, a, land, grant, in, exchange, for, service, was, called, a, beneficium, latin, later, the, term, feudum, or, feodum, began, to, replace, beneficium, in, the, documents, the, first, attested, instance, of, this, is, from, 984, although, more, primitive, forms, were, seen, up, to, one, hundred, years, earlier, the, origin, of, the, feudum, and, why, it, replaced, beneficium, has, not, been, well, established, but, there, are, multiple, theories, described, below, the, term, f, odal, was, first, used, in, 17th, century, french, legal, treatises, 1614, and, translated, into, english, legal, treatises, as, an, adjective, such, as, feodal, government, in, the, 18th, century, adam, smith, seeking, to, describe, economic, systems, effectively, coined, the, forms, feudal, government, and, feudal, system, in, his, book, the, wealth, of, nations, 1776, the, phrase, feudal, system, appeared, in, 1736, in, baronia, anglica, published, nine, years, after, the, death, of, its, author, thomas, madox, in, 1727, in, 1771, in, his, book, the, history, of, manchester, john, whitaker, first, introduced, the, word, feudalism, and, the, notion, of, the, feudal, pyramid, another, theory, by, alauddin, samarrai, suggests, an, arabic, origin, from, fuy, the, plural, of, fay, which, literally, means, the, returned, and, was, used, especially, for, land, that, has, been, conquered, from, enemies, that, did, not, fight, samarrai, s, theory, is, that, early, forms, of, fief, include, feo, feu, feuz, feuum, and, others, the, plurality, of, forms, strongly, suggesting, origins, from, a, loanword, the, first, use, of, these, terms, is, in, languedoc, one, of, the, least, germanic, areas, of, europe, and, bordering, al, andalus, muslim, spain, further, the, earliest, use, of, feuum, as, a, replacement, for, beneficium, can, be, dated, to, 899, the, same, year, a, muslim, base, at, fraxinetum, la, garde, freinet, in, provence, was, established, it, is, possible, samarrai, says, that, french, scribes, writing, in, latin, attempted, to, transliterate, the, arabic, word, fuy, the, plural, of, fay, which, was, used, by, the, muslim, invaders, and, occupiers, at, the, time, resulting, in, a, plurality, of, forms, feo, feu, feuz, feuum, and, others, from, which, eventually, feudum, derived, samarrai, however, also, advises, to, handle, this, theory, with, care, as, medieval, and, early, modern, muslim, scribes, often, used, etymologically, fanciful, roots, to, support, outlandish, claims, that, something, was, of, arabian, or, muslim, origin, feudalism, in, its, various, forms, usually, emerged, as, a, result, of, the, decentralization, of, an, empire, such, as, in, the, carolingian, empire, in, the, 9th, century, ad, which, lacked, the, bureaucratic, infrastructure, necessary, to, support, cavalry, without, allocating, land, to, these, mounted, troops, mounted, soldiers, began, to, secure, a, system, of, hereditary, rule, over, their, allocated, land, and, their, power, over, the, territory, came, to, encompass, the, social, political, judicial, and, economic, spheres, these, acquired, powers, significantly, diminished, unitary, power, in, these, empires, however, once, the, infrastructure, to, maintain, unitary, power, was, re, established, as, with, the, european, monarchies, feudalism, began, to, yield, to, this, new, power, structure, and, eventually, disappeared, the, classic, fran, ois, louis, ganshof, version, of, feudalism, describes, a, set, of, reciprocal, legal, and, military, obligations, of, the, warrior, nobility, based, on, the, key, concepts, of, lords, vassals, and, fiefs, in, broad, terms, a, lord, was, a, noble, who, held, land, a, vassal, was, a, person, granted, possession, of, the, land, by, the, lord, and, the, land, was, known, as, a, fief, in, exchange, for, the, use, of, the, fief, and, protection, by, the, lord, the, vassal, provided, some, sort, of, service, to, the, lord, there, were, many, varieties, of, feudal, land, tenure, consisting, of, military, and, non, military, service, the, obligations, and, corresponding, rights, between, lord, and, vassal, concerning, the, fief, form, the, basis, of, the, feudal, relationship, before, a, lord, could, grant, land, a, fief, to, someone, he, had, to, make, that, person, a, vassal, this, was, done, at, a, formal, and, symbolic, ceremony, called, a, commendation, ceremony, which, was, composed, of, the, two, part, act, of, homage, and, oath, of, fealty, during, homage, the, lord, and, vassal, entered, into, a, contract, in, which, the, vassal, promised, to, fight, for, the, lord, at, his, command, whilst, the, lord, agreed, to, protect, the, vassal, from, external, forces, fealty, comes, from, the, latin, fidelitas, and, denotes, the, fidelity, owed, by, a, vassal, to, his, feudal, lord, fealty, also, refers, to, an, oath, that, more, explicitly, reinforces, the, commitments, of, the, vassal, made, during, homage, such, an, oath, follows, homage, once, the, commendation, ceremony, was, complete, the, lord, and, vassal, were, in, a, feudal, relationship, with, agreed, obligations, to, one, another, the, vassal, s, principal, obligation, to, the, lord, was, to, provide, aid, or, military, service, using, whatever, equipment, the, vassal, could, obtain, by, virtue, of, the, revenues, from, the, fief, the, vassal, had, to, answer, calls, to, military, service, by, the, lord, this, security, of, military, help, was, the, primary, reason, the, lord, entered, into, the, feudal, relationship, in, addition, the, vassal, could, have, other, obligations, to, his, lord, such, as, attendance, at, his, court, whether, manorial, baronial, both, termed, court, baron, or, at, the, king, s, court, it, could, also, involve, the, vassal, providing, counsel, so, that, if, the, lord, faced, a, major, decision, he, would, summon, all, his, vassals, and, hold, a, council, at, the, level, of, the, manor, this, might, be, a, fairly, mundane, matter, of, agricultural, policy, but, also, included, sentencing, by, the, lord, for, criminal, offences, including, capital, punishment, in, some, cases, concerning, the, king, s, feudal, court, such, deliberation, could, include, the, question, of, declaring, war, these, are, examples, of, feudalism, depending, on, the, period, of, time, and, location, in, europe, feudal, customs, and, practices, varied, in, its, origin, the, feudal, grant, of, land, had, been, seen, in, terms, of, a, personal, bond, between, lord, and, vassal, but, with, time, and, the, transformation, of, fiefs, into, hereditary, holdings, the, nature, of, the, system, came, to, be, seen, as, a, form, of, politics, of, land, an, expression, used, by, the, historian, marc, bloch, the, 11th, century, in, france, saw, what, has, been, called, by, historians, a, feudal, revolution, or, mutation, and, a, fragmentation, of, powers, bloch, that, was, unlike, the, development, of, feudalism, in, england, or, italy, or, in, germany, in, the, same, period, or, later, counties, and, duchies, began, to, break, down, into, smaller, holdings, as, castellans, and, lesser, seigneurs, took, control, of, local, lands, and, as, comital, families, had, done, before, them, lesser, lords, usurped, privatized, a, wide, range, of, prerogatives, and, rights, of, the, state, including, travel, dues, market, dues, fees, for, using, woodlands, obligations, use, the, lord, s, mill, and, most, importantly, the, highly, profitable, rights, of, justice, etc, what, georges, duby, called, collectively, the, seigneurie, banale, power, in, this, period, became, more, personal, this, fragmentation, of, powers, was, not, however, systematic, throughout, france, and, in, certain, counties, such, as, flanders, normandy, anjou, toulouse, counts, were, able, to, maintain, control, of, their, lands, into, the, 12th, century, or, later, thus, in, some, regions, like, normandy, and, flanders, the, vassal, feudal, system, was, an, effective, tool, for, ducal, and, comital, control, linking, vassals, to, their, lords, but, in, other, regions, the, system, led, to, significant, confusion, all, the, more, so, as, vassals, could, and, frequently, did, pledge, themselves, to, two, or, more, lords, in, response, to, this, the, idea, of, a, liege, lord, was, developed, where, the, obligations, to, one, lord, are, regarded, as, superior, in, the, 12th, century, around, this, time, rich, middle, class, commoners, chafed, at, the, authority, and, powers, held, by, feudal, lords, overlords, and, nobles, and, preferred, the, idea, of, autocratic, rule, where, a, king, and, one, royal, court, held, almost, all, the, power, feudal, nobles, regardless, of, ethnicity, generally, thought, of, themselves, as, arbiters, of, a, politically, free, system, so, this, often, puzzled, them, before, the, fall, of, most, feudal, laws, most, of, the, military, aspects, of, feudalism, effectively, ended, by, about, 1500, this, was, partly, since, the, military, shifted, from, armies, consisting, of, the, nobility, to, professional, fighters, thus, reducing, the, nobility, s, claim, on, power, but, also, because, the, black, death, reduced, the, nobility, s, hold, over, the, lower, classes, vestiges, of, the, feudal, system, hung, on, in, france, until, the, french, revolution, of, the, 1790s, even, when, the, original, feudal, relationships, had, disappeared, there, were, many, institutional, remnants, of, feudalism, left, in, place, historian, georges, lefebvre, explains, how, at, an, early, stage, of, the, french, revolution, on, just, one, night, of, 4, august, 1789, france, abolished, the, long, lasting, remnants, of, the, feudal, order, it, announced, the, national, assembly, abolishes, the, feudal, system, entirely, lefebvre, explains, without, debate, the, assembly, enthusiastically, adopted, equality, of, taxation, and, redemption, of, all, manorial, rights, except, for, those, involving, personal, servitude, which, were, to, be, abolished, without, indemnification, other, proposals, followed, with, the, same, success, the, equality, of, legal, punishment, admission, of, all, to, public, office, abolition, of, venality, in, office, conversion, of, the, tithe, into, payments, subject, to, redemption, freedom, of, worship, prohibition, of, plural, holding, of, benefices, privileges, of, provinces, and, towns, were, offered, as, a, last, sacrifice, originally, the, peasants, were, supposed, to, pay, for, the, release, of, seigneurial, dues, these, dues, affected, more, than, a, quarter, of, the, farmland, in, france, and, provided, most, of, the, income, of, the, large, landowners, the, majority, refused, to, pay, and, in, 1793, the, obligation, was, cancelled, thus, the, peasants, got, their, land, free, and, also, no, longer, paid, the, tithe, to, the, church, in, the, kingdom, of, france, following, the, french, revolution, feudalism, was, abolished, with, a, decree, of, 11, august, 1789, by, the, constituent, assembly, a, provision, that, was, later, extended, to, various, parts, of, italian, kingdom, following, the, invasion, by, french, troops, in, the, kingdom, of, naples, joachim, murat, abolished, feudalism, with, the, law, of, 2, august, 1806, then, implemented, with, a, law, of, 1, september, 1806, and, a, royal, decree, of, 3, december, 1808, in, the, kingdom, of, sicily, the, abolishing, law, was, issued, by, the, sicilian, parliament, on, 10, august, 1812, in, piedmont, feudalism, ceased, by, virtue, of, the, edicts, of, 7, march, and, 19, july, 1797, issued, by, charles, emmanuel, iv, although, in, the, kingdom, of, sardinia, specifically, on, the, island, of, sardinia, feudalism, was, abolished, only, with, an, edict, of, 5, august, 1848, in, the, kingdom, of, lombardy, venetia, feudalism, was, abolished, with, the, law, of, 5, december, 1861, n, 342, were, all, feudal, bonds, abolished, the, system, lingered, on, in, parts, of, central, and, eastern, europe, as, late, as, the, 1850s, slavery, in, romania, was, abolished, in, 1856, russia, finally, abolished, serfdom, in, 1861, more, recently, in, scotland, on, 28, november, 2004, the, abolition, of, feudal, tenure, etc, scotland, act, 2000, entered, into, full, force, putting, an, end, to, what, was, left, of, the, scottish, feudal, system, the, last, feudal, regime, that, of, the, island, of, sark, was, abolished, in, december, 2008, when, the, first, democratic, elections, were, held, for, the, election, of, a, local, parliament, and, the, appointment, of, a, government, the, revolution, is, a, consequence, of, the, juridical, intervention, of, the, european, parliament, which, declared, the, local, constitutional, system, as, contrary, to, human, rights, and, following, a, series, of, legal, battles, imposed, parliamentary, democracy, the, phrase, feudal, society, as, defined, by, marc, bloch, offers, a, wider, definition, than, ganshof, s, and, includes, within, the, feudal, structure, not, only, the, warrior, aristocracy, bound, by, vassalage, but, also, the, peasantry, bound, by, manorialism, and, the, estates, of, the, church, thus, the, feudal, order, embraces, society, from, top, to, bottom, though, the, powerful, and, well, differentiated, social, group, of, the, urban, classes, came, to, occupy, a, distinct, position, to, some, extent, outside, the, classic, feudal, hierarchy, the, idea, of, feudalism, was, unknown, and, the, system, it, describes, was, not, conceived, of, as, a, formal, political, system, by, the, people, living, in, the, medieval, period, this, section, describes, the, history, of, the, idea, of, feudalism, how, the, concept, originated, among, scholars, and, thinkers, how, it, changed, over, time, and, modern, debates, about, its, use, the, concept, of, a, feudal, state, or, period, in, the, sense, of, either, a, regime, or, a, period, dominated, by, lords, who, possess, financial, or, social, power, and, prestige, became, widely, held, in, the, middle, of, the, 18th, century, as, a, result, of, works, such, as, montesquieu, s, de, l, esprit, des, lois, 1748, published, in, english, as, the, spirit, of, law, and, henri, de, boulainvilliers, s, histoire, des, anciens, parlements, de, france, 1737, published, in, english, as, an, historical, account, of, the, ancient, parliaments, of, france, or, states, general, of, the, kingdom, 1739, in, the, 18th, century, writers, of, the, enlightenment, wrote, about, feudalism, to, denigrate, the, antiquated, system, of, the, ancien, r, gime, or, french, monarchy, this, was, the, age, of, enlightenment, when, writers, valued, reason, and, the, middle, ages, were, viewed, as, the, dark, ages, enlightenment, authors, generally, mocked, and, ridiculed, anything, from, the, dark, ages, including, feudalism, projecting, its, negative, characteristics, on, the, current, french, monarchy, as, a, means, of, political, gain, for, them, feudalism, meant, seigneurial, privileges, and, prerogatives, when, the, french, constituent, assembly, abolished, the, feudal, regime, in, august, 1789, this, is, what, was, meant, adam, smith, used, the, term, feudal, system, to, describe, a, social, and, economic, system, defined, by, inherited, social, ranks, each, of, which, possessed, inherent, social, and, economic, privileges, and, obligations, in, such, a, system, wealth, derived, from, agriculture, which, was, arranged, not, according, to, market, forces, but, on, the, basis, of, customary, labour, services, owed, by, serfs, to, landowning, nobles, heinrich, brunner, in, his, the, equestrian, service, and, the, beginnings, of, the, feudal, system, 1887, maintained, that, charles, martel, laid, the, foundation, for, feudalism, during, the, 8th, century, brunner, believed, martel, to, be, a, brilliant, warrior, who, secularized, church, lands, for, the, purpose, of, providing, precarias, or, leases, for, his, followers, in, return, for, their, military, service, martel, s, military, ambitions, were, becoming, more, expensive, as, it, changed, into, a, cavalry, force, thus, the, need, to, maintain, his, followers, through, the, despoiling, of, church, lands, responding, to, brunner, s, thesis, paul, fouracre, theorizes, that, the, church, itself, held, power, over, the, land, with, its, own, precarias, the, most, commonly, utilized, precarias, was, the, gifting, of, land, to, the, church, done, for, various, spiritual, and, legal, purposes, although, charles, martel, did, indeed, utilize, precaria, for, his, own, purposes, and, even, drove, some, of, the, bishops, out, of, the, church, and, placed, his, own, laymen, in, their, seats, fouracre, discounts, martel, s, role, in, creating, political, change, that, it, was, simply, a, military, move, in, order, to, have, control, in, the, region, by, hording, land, through, tenancies, and, expelling, the, bishops, who, he, did, not, agree, with, but, it, did, not, specifically, create, feudalism, karl, marx, also, uses, the, term, in, the, 19th, century, in, his, analysis, of, society, s, economic, and, political, development, describing, feudalism, or, more, usually, feudal, society, or, the, feudal, mode, of, production, as, the, order, coming, before, capitalism, for, marx, what, defined, feudalism, was, the, power, of, the, ruling, class, the, aristocracy, in, their, control, of, arable, land, leading, to, a, class, society, based, upon, the, exploitation, of, the, peasants, who, farm, these, lands, typically, under, serfdom, and, principally, by, means, of, labour, produce, and, money, rents, he, deemed, feudalism, a, democracy, of, unfreedom, juxtaposing, the, oppression, of, feudal, subjects, with, a, holistic, integration, of, political, and, economic, life, of, the, sort, lacking, under, industrial, capitalism, he, also, took, it, as, a, paradigm, for, understanding, the, power, relationships, between, capitalists, and, wage, labourers, in, his, own, time, in, pre, capitalist, systems, it, was, obvious, that, most, people, did, not, control, their, own, destiny, under, feudalism, for, instance, serfs, had, to, work, for, their, lords, capitalism, seems, different, because, people, are, in, theory, free, to, work, for, themselves, or, for, others, as, they, choose, yet, most, workers, have, as, little, control, over, their, lives, as, feudal, serfs, some, later, marxist, theorists, e, g, eric, wolf, have, applied, this, label, to, include, non, european, societies, grouping, feudalism, together, with, imperial, china, and, the, inca, empire, in, the, pre, columbian, era, as, tributary, societies, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, j, horace, round, and, frederic, william, maitland, both, historians, of, medieval, britain, arrived, at, different, conclusions, about, the, character, of, anglo, saxon, english, society, before, the, norman, conquest, in, 1066, round, argued, that, the, normans, had, brought, feudalism, with, them, to, england, while, maitland, contended, that, its, fundamentals, were, already, in, place, in, britain, before, 1066, the, debate, continues, today, but, a, consensus, viewpoint, is, that, england, before, the, conquest, had, commendation, which, embodied, some, of, the, personal, elements, in, feudalism, while, william, the, conqueror, introduced, a, modified, and, stricter, northern, french, feudalism, to, england, incorporating, 1086, oaths, of, loyalty, to, the, king, by, all, who, held, by, feudal, tenure, even, the, vassals, of, his, principal, vassals, holding, by, feudal, tenure, meant, that, vassals, must, provide, the, quota, of, knights, required, by, the, king, or, a, money, payment, in, substitution, in, the, 20th, century, two, outstanding, historians, offered, still, more, widely, differing, perspectives, the, french, historian, marc, bloch, arguably, the, most, influential, 20th, century, medieval, historian, approached, feudalism, not, so, much, from, a, legal, and, military, point, of, view, but, from, a, sociological, one, presenting, in, feudal, society, 1939, english, 1961, a, feudal, order, not, limited, solely, to, the, nobility, it, is, his, radical, notion, that, peasants, were, part, of, the, feudal, relationship, that, sets, bloch, apart, from, his, peers, while, the, vassal, performed, military, service, in, exchange, for, the, fief, the, peasant, performed, physical, labour, in, return, for, protection, both, are, a, form, of, feudal, relationship, according, to, bloch, other, elements, of, society, can, be, seen, in, feudal, terms, all, the, aspects, of, life, were, centred, on, lordship, and, so, we, can, speak, usefully, of, a, feudal, church, structure, a, feudal, courtly, and, anti, courtly, literature, and, a, feudal, economy, in, contradistinction, to, bloch, the, belgian, historian, fran, ois, louis, ganshof, defined, feudalism, from, a, narrow, legal, and, military, perspective, arguing, that, feudal, relationships, existed, only, within, the, medieval, nobility, itself, ganshof, articulated, this, concept, in, qu, est, ce, que, la, f, odalit, what, is, feudalism, 1944, translated, in, english, as, feudalism, his, classic, definition, of, feudalism, is, widely, accepted, today, among, medieval, scholars, though, questioned, both, by, those, who, view, the, concept, in, wider, terms, and, by, those, who, find, insufficient, uniformity, in, noble, exchanges, to, support, such, a, model, although, georges, duby, was, never, formally, a, student, in, the, circle, of, scholars, around, marc, bloch, and, lucien, febvre, that, came, to, be, known, as, the, annales, school, duby, was, an, exponent, of, the, annaliste, tradition, in, a, published, version, of, his, 1952, doctoral, thesis, entitled, la, soci, t, aux, xie, et, xiie, si, cles, dans, la, r, gion, m, connaise, society, in, the, 11th, and, 12th, centuries, in, the, m, connais, region, and, working, from, the, extensive, documentary, sources, surviving, from, the, burgundian, monastery, of, cluny, as, well, as, the, dioceses, of, m, con, and, dijon, duby, excavated, the, complex, social, and, economic, relationships, among, the, individuals, and, institutions, of, the, m, connais, region, and, charted, a, profound, shift, in, the, social, structures, of, medieval, society, around, the, year, 1000, he, argued, that, in, early, 11th, century, governing, institutions, particularly, comital, courts, established, under, the, carolingian, monarchy, that, had, represented, public, justice, and, order, in, burgundy, during, the, 9th, and, 10th, centuries, receded, and, gave, way, to, a, new, feudal, order, wherein, independent, aristocratic, knights, wielded, power, over, peasant, communities, through, strong, arm, tactics, and, threats, of, violence, in, 1939, the, austrian, historian, theodor, mayer, subordinated, the, feudal, state, as, secondary, to, his, concept, of, a, personenverbandsstaat, personal, interdependency, state, understanding, it, in, contrast, to, the, territorial, state, this, form, of, statehood, identified, with, the, holy, roman, empire, is, described, as, the, most, complete, form, of, medieval, rule, completing, conventional, feudal, structure, of, lordship, and, vassalage, with, the, personal, association, among, the, nobility, but, the, applicability, of, this, concept, to, cases, outside, of, the, holy, roman, empire, has, been, questioned, as, by, susan, reynolds, the, concept, has, also, been, questioned, and, superseded, in, german, historiography, because, of, its, bias, and, reductionism, towards, legitimating, the, f, hrerprinzip, in, 1974, the, american, historian, elizabeth, a, r, brown, rejected, the, label, feudalism, as, an, anachronism, that, imparts, a, false, sense, of, uniformity, to, the, concept, having, noted, the, current, use, of, many, often, contradictory, definitions, of, feudalism, she, argued, that, the, word, is, only, a, construct, with, no, basis, in, medieval, reality, an, invention, of, modern, historians, read, back, tyrannically, into, the, historical, record, supporters, of, brown, have, suggested, that, the, term, should, be, expunged, from, history, textbooks, and, lectures, on, medieval, history, entirely, in, fiefs, and, vassals, the, medieval, evidence, reinterpreted, 1994, susan, reynolds, expanded, upon, brown, s, original, thesis, although, some, contemporaries, questioned, reynolds, s, methodology, other, historians, have, supported, it, and, her, argument, reynolds, argues, too, many, models, of, feudalism, used, for, comparisons, even, by, marxists, are, still, either, constructed, on, the, 16th, century, basis, or, incorporate, what, in, a, marxist, view, must, surely, be, superficial, or, irrelevant, features, from, it, even, when, one, restricts, oneself, to, europe, and, to, feudalism, in, its, narrow, sense, it, is, extremely, doubtful, whether, feudo, vassalic, institutions, formed, a, coherent, bundle, of, institutions, or, concepts, that, were, structurally, separate, from, other, institutions, and, concepts, of, the, time, the, term, feudal, has, also, been, applied, to, non, western, societies, in, which, institutions, and, attitudes, similar, to, those, of, medieval, europe, are, perceived, to, have, prevailed, see, examples, of, feudalism, japan, has, been, extensively, studied, in, this, regard, karl, friday, notes, that, in, the, 21st, century, historians, of, japan, rarely, invoke, feudalism, instead, of, looking, at, similarities, specialists, attempting, comparative, analysis, concentrate, on, fundamental, differences, ultimately, critics, say, the, many, ways, the, term, feudalism, has, been, used, have, deprived, it, of, specific, meaning, leading, some, historians, and, political, theorists, to, reject, it, as, a, useful, concept, for, understanding, society, historian, richard, abels, notes, that, western, civilization, and, world, civilization, textbooks, now, shy, away, from, the, term, feudalism
