paleolithic, epipalaeolithic, mesolithic, neolithic, the, stone, age, was, a, broad, prehistoric, period, during, which, stone, was, widely, used, to, make, stone, tools, with, an, edge, a, point, or, a, percussion, surface, the, period, lasted, for, roughly, 3, 4, million, years, and, ended, between, 4000, bc, and, 2000, bc, with, the, advent, of, metalworking, it, therefore, represents, nearly, 99, 3, of, human, history, though, some, simple, metalworking, of, malleable, metals, particularly, the, use, of, gold, and, copper, for, purposes, of, ornamentation, was, known, in, the, stone, age, it, is, the, melting, and, smelting, of, copper, that, marks, the, end, of, the, stone, age, in, western, asia, this, occurred, by, about, 3000, bc, when, bronze, became, widespread, the, term, bronze, age, is, used, to, describe, the, period, that, followed, the, stone, age, as, well, as, to, describe, cultures, that, had, developed, techniques, and, technologies, for, working, copper, alloys, bronze, originally, copper, and, arsenic, later, copper, and, tin, into, tools, supplanting, stone, in, many, uses, stone, age, artifacts, that, have, been, discovered, include, tools, used, by, modern, humans, by, their, predecessor, species, in, the, genus, homo, and, possibly, by, the, earlier, partly, contemporaneous, genera, australopithecus, and, paranthropus, bone, tools, have, been, discovered, that, were, used, during, this, period, as, well, but, these, are, rarely, preserved, in, the, archaeological, record, the, stone, age, is, further, subdivided, by, the, types, of, stone, tools, in, use, the, stone, age, is, the, first, period, in, the, three, age, system, frequently, used, in, archaeology, to, divide, the, timeline, of, human, technological, prehistory, into, functional, periods, with, the, next, two, being, the, bronze, age, and, the, iron, age, respectively, the, stone, age, is, also, commonly, divided, into, three, distinct, periods, the, earliest, and, most, primitive, being, the, paleolithic, era, a, transitional, period, with, finer, tools, known, as, the, mesolithic, era, and, the, final, stage, known, as, the, neolithic, era, neolithic, peoples, were, the, first, to, transition, away, from, hunter, gatherer, societies, into, the, settled, lifestyle, of, inhabiting, towns, and, villages, as, agriculture, became, widespread, in, the, chronology, of, prehistory, the, neolithic, era, usually, overlaps, with, the, chalcolithic, copper, era, preceding, the, bronze, age, the, stone, age, is, contemporaneous, with, the, evolution, of, the, genus, homo, with, the, possible, exception, of, the, early, stone, age, when, species, prior, to, homo, may, have, manufactured, tools, according, to, the, age, and, location, of, the, current, evidence, the, cradle, of, the, genus, is, the, east, african, rift, system, especially, toward, the, north, in, ethiopia, where, it, is, bordered, by, grasslands, the, closest, relative, among, the, other, living, primates, the, genus, pan, represents, a, branch, that, continued, on, in, the, deep, forest, where, the, primates, evolved, the, rift, served, as, a, conduit, for, movement, into, southern, africa, and, also, north, down, the, nile, into, north, africa, and, through, the, continuation, of, the, rift, in, the, levant, to, the, vast, grasslands, of, asia, starting, from, about, 4, million, years, ago, mya, a, single, biome, established, itself, from, south, africa, through, the, rift, north, africa, and, across, asia, to, modern, china, this, has, been, called, transcontinental, savannahstan, recently, starting, in, the, grasslands, of, the, rift, homo, erectus, the, predecessor, of, modern, humans, found, an, ecological, niche, as, a, tool, maker, and, developed, a, dependence, on, it, becoming, a, tool, equipped, savanna, dweller, the, oldest, indirect, evidence, found, of, stone, tool, use, is, fossilised, animal, bones, with, tool, marks, these, are, 3, 4, million, years, old, and, were, found, in, the, lower, awash, valley, in, ethiopia, archaeological, discoveries, in, kenya, in, 2015, identifying, what, may, be, the, oldest, evidence, of, hominin, use, of, tools, known, to, date, have, indicated, that, kenyanthropus, platyops, a, 3, 2, to, 3, 5, million, year, old, pliocene, hominin, fossil, discovered, in, lake, turkana, kenya, in, 1999, may, have, been, the, earliest, tool, users, known, the, oldest, stone, tools, were, excavated, from, the, site, of, lomekwi, 3, in, west, turkana, northwestern, kenya, and, date, to, 3, 3, million, years, old, prior, to, the, discovery, of, these, lomekwian, tools, the, oldest, known, stone, tools, had, been, found, at, several, sites, at, gona, ethiopia, on, sediments, of, the, paleo, awash, river, which, serve, to, date, them, all, the, tools, come, from, the, busidama, formation, which, lies, above, a, disconformity, or, missing, layer, which, would, have, been, from, 2, 9, to, 2, 7, mya, the, oldest, sites, discovered, to, contain, tools, are, dated, to, 2, 6, 2, 55, mya, one, of, the, most, striking, circumstances, about, these, sites, is, that, they, are, from, the, late, pliocene, where, prior, to, their, discovery, tools, were, thought, to, have, evolved, only, in, the, pleistocene, excavators, at, the, locality, point, out, that, the, earliest, stone, tool, makers, were, skilled, flintknappers, the, possible, reasons, behind, this, seeming, abrupt, transition, from, the, absence, of, stone, tools, to, the, presence, thereof, include, gaps, in, the, geological, record, the, species, that, made, the, pliocene, tools, remains, unknown, fragments, of, australopithecus, garhi, australopithecus, aethiopicus, and, homo, possibly, homo, habilis, have, been, found, in, sites, near, the, age, of, the, gona, tools, in, july, 2018, scientists, reported, the, discovery, in, china, of, the, known, oldest, stone, tools, outside, africa, estimated, at, 2, 12, million, years, old, innovation, in, the, technique, of, smelting, ore, is, regarded, as, the, end, of, the, stone, age, and, the, beginning, of, the, bronze, age, the, first, highly, significant, metal, manufactured, was, bronze, an, alloy, of, copper, and, tin, or, arsenic, each, of, which, was, smelted, separately, the, transition, from, the, stone, age, to, the, bronze, age, was, a, period, during, which, modern, people, could, smelt, copper, but, did, not, yet, manufacture, bronze, a, time, known, as, the, copper, age, or, more, technically, the, chalcolithic, or, eneolithic, both, meaning, copper, stone, the, chalcolithic, by, convention, is, the, initial, period, of, the, bronze, age, the, bronze, age, was, followed, by, the, iron, age, the, transition, out, of, the, stone, age, occurred, between, 6000, and, 2500, bc, for, much, of, humanity, living, in, north, africa, and, eurasia, the, first, evidence, of, human, metallurgy, dates, to, between, the, 6th, and, 5th, millennia, bc, in, the, archaeological, sites, of, the, vin, a, culture, including, majdanpek, jarmovac, plo, nik, rudna, glava, in, modern, day, serbia, tzi, the, iceman, a, mummy, from, about, 3300, bc, carried, with, him, a, copper, axe, and, a, flint, knife, in, some, regions, such, as, sub, saharan, africa, the, stone, age, was, followed, directly, by, the, iron, age, the, middle, east, and, southeast, asian, regions, progressed, past, stone, age, technology, around, 6000, bc, europe, and, the, rest, of, asia, became, post, stone, age, societies, by, about, 4000, bc, the, proto, inca, cultures, of, south, america, continued, at, a, stone, age, level, until, around, 2000, bc, when, gold, copper, and, silver, made, their, entrance, the, peoples, of, the, americas, notably, did, not, develop, a, widespread, behavior, of, smelting, bronze, or, iron, after, the, stone, age, period, although, the, technology, existed, stone, tool, manufacture, continued, even, after, the, stone, age, ended, in, a, given, area, in, europe, and, north, america, millstones, were, in, use, until, well, into, the, 20th, century, and, still, are, in, many, parts, of, the, world, the, terms, stone, age, bronze, age, and, iron, age, are, not, intended, to, suggest, that, advancements, and, time, periods, in, prehistory, are, only, measured, by, the, type, of, tool, material, rather, than, for, example, social, organization, food, sources, exploited, adaptation, to, climate, adoption, of, agriculture, cooking, settlement, and, religion, like, pottery, the, typology, of, the, stone, tools, combined, with, the, relative, sequence, of, the, types, in, various, regions, provide, a, chronological, framework, for, the, evolution, of, humanity, and, society, they, serve, as, diagnostics, of, date, rather, than, characterizing, the, people, or, the, society, lithic, analysis, is, a, major, and, specialised, form, of, archaeological, investigation, it, involves, the, measurement, of, stone, tools, to, determine, their, typology, function, and, technologies, involved, it, includes, the, scientific, study, of, the, lithic, reduction, of, the, raw, materials, and, methods, used, to, make, the, prehistoric, artifacts, that, are, discovered, much, of, this, study, takes, place, in, the, laboratory, in, the, presence, of, various, specialists, in, experimental, archaeology, researchers, attempt, to, create, replica, tools, to, understand, how, they, were, made, flintknappers, are, craftsmen, who, use, sharp, tools, to, reduce, flintstone, to, flint, tool, in, addition, to, lithic, analysis, field, prehistorians, use, a, wide, range, of, techniques, derived, from, multiple, fields, the, work, of, archaeologists, in, determining, the, paleocontext, and, relative, sequence, of, the, layers, is, supplemented, by, the, efforts, of, geologic, specialists, in, identifying, layers, of, rock, developed, or, deposited, over, geologic, time, of, paleontological, specialists, in, identifying, bones, and, animals, of, palynologists, in, discovering, and, identifying, pollen, spores, and, plant, species, of, physicists, and, chemists, in, laboratories, determining, ages, of, materials, by, carbon, 14, potassium, argon, and, other, methods, the, study, of, the, stone, age, has, never, been, limited, to, stone, tools, and, archaeology, even, though, they, are, important, forms, of, evidence, the, chief, focus, of, study, has, always, been, on, the, society, and, the, living, people, who, belonged, to, it, useful, as, it, has, been, the, concept, of, the, stone, age, has, its, limitations, the, date, range, of, this, period, is, ambiguous, disputed, and, variable, depending, upon, the, region, in, question, while, it, is, possible, to, speak, of, a, general, stone, age, period, for, the, whole, of, humanity, some, groups, never, developed, metal, smelting, technology, and, so, remained, in, the, so, called, stone, age, until, they, encountered, technologically, developed, cultures, the, term, was, innovated, to, describe, the, archaeological, cultures, of, europe, it, may, not, always, be, the, best, in, relation, to, regions, such, as, some, parts, of, the, indies, and, oceania, where, farmers, or, hunter, gatherers, used, stone, for, tools, until, european, colonisation, began, archaeologists, of, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, ce, who, adapted, the, three, age, system, to, their, ideas, hoped, to, combine, cultural, anthropology, and, archaeology, in, such, a, way, that, a, specific, contemporaneous, tribe, could, be, used, to, illustrate, the, way, of, life, and, beliefs, of, the, people, exercising, a, particular, stone, age, technology, as, a, description, of, people, living, today, the, term, stone, age, is, controversial, the, association, of, social, anthropologists, discourages, this, use, asserting, to, describe, any, living, group, as, primitive, or, stone, age, inevitably, implies, that, they, are, living, representatives, of, some, earlier, stage, of, human, development, that, the, majority, of, humankind, has, left, behind, in, the, 1920s, south, african, archaeologists, organizing, the, stone, tool, collections, of, that, country, observed, that, they, did, not, fit, the, newly, detailed, three, age, system, in, the, words, of, j, desmond, clark, it, was, early, realized, that, the, threefold, division, of, culture, into, stone, bronze, and, iron, ages, adopted, in, the, nineteenth, century, for, europe, had, no, validity, in, africa, outside, the, nile, valley, consequently, they, proposed, a, new, system, for, africa, the, three, stage, system, clark, regarded, the, three, age, system, as, valid, for, north, africa, in, sub, saharan, africa, the, three, stage, system, was, best, in, practice, the, failure, of, african, archaeologists, either, to, keep, this, distinction, in, mind, or, to, explain, which, one, they, mean, contributes, to, the, considerable, equivocation, already, present, in, the, literature, there, are, in, effect, two, stone, ages, one, part, of, the, three, age, and, the, other, constituting, the, three, stage, they, refer, to, one, and, the, same, artifacts, and, the, same, technologies, but, vary, by, locality, and, time, the, three, stage, system, was, proposed, in, 1929, by, astley, john, hilary, goodwin, a, professional, archaeologist, and, clarence, van, riet, lowe, a, civil, engineer, and, amateur, archaeologist, in, an, article, titled, stone, age, cultures, of, south, africa, in, the, journal, annals, of, the, south, african, museum, by, then, the, dates, of, the, early, stone, age, or, paleolithic, and, late, stone, age, or, neolithic, neo, new, were, fairly, solid, and, were, regarded, by, goodwin, as, absolute, he, therefore, proposed, a, relative, chronology, of, periods, with, floating, dates, to, be, called, the, earlier, and, later, stone, age, the, middle, stone, age, would, not, change, its, name, but, it, would, not, mean, mesolithic, the, duo, thus, reinvented, the, stone, age, in, sub, saharan, africa, however, iron, working, technologies, were, either, invented, independently, or, came, across, the, sahara, from, the, north, see, iron, metallurgy, in, africa, the, neolithic, was, characterized, primarily, by, herding, societies, rather, than, large, agricultural, societies, and, although, there, was, copper, metallurgy, in, africa, as, well, as, bronze, smelting, archaeologists, do, not, currently, recognize, a, separate, copper, age, or, bronze, age, moreover, the, technologies, included, in, those, stages, as, goodwin, called, them, were, not, exactly, the, same, since, then, the, original, relative, terms, have, become, identified, with, the, technologies, of, the, paleolithic, and, mesolithic, so, that, they, are, no, longer, relative, moreover, there, has, been, a, tendency, to, drop, the, comparative, degree, in, favor, of, the, positive, resulting, in, two, sets, of, early, middle, and, late, stone, ages, of, quite, different, content, and, chronologies, by, voluntary, agreement, archaeologists, respect, the, decisions, of, the, pan, african, congress, on, prehistory, which, meets, every, four, years, to, resolve, the, archaeological, business, brought, before, it, delegates, are, actually, international, the, organization, takes, its, name, from, the, topic, louis, leakey, hosted, the, first, one, in, nairobi, in, 1947, it, adopted, goodwin, and, lowe, s, 3, stage, system, at, that, time, the, stages, to, be, called, early, middle, and, later, the, problem, of, the, transitions, in, archaeology, is, a, branch, of, the, general, philosophic, continuity, problem, which, examines, how, discrete, objects, of, any, sort, that, are, contiguous, in, any, way, can, be, presumed, to, have, a, relationship, of, any, sort, in, archaeology, the, relationship, is, one, of, causality, if, period, b, can, be, presumed, to, descend, from, period, a, there, must, be, a, boundary, between, a, and, b, the, a, b, boundary, the, problem, is, in, the, nature, of, this, boundary, if, there, is, no, distinct, boundary, then, the, population, of, a, suddenly, stopped, using, the, customs, characteristic, of, a, and, suddenly, started, using, those, of, b, an, unlikely, scenario, in, the, process, of, evolution, more, realistically, a, distinct, border, period, the, a, b, transition, existed, in, which, the, customs, of, a, were, gradually, dropped, and, those, of, b, acquired, if, transitions, do, not, exist, then, there, is, no, proof, of, any, continuity, between, a, and, b, the, stone, age, of, europe, is, characteristically, in, deficit, of, known, transitions, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, innovators, of, the, modern, three, age, system, recognized, the, problem, of, the, initial, transition, the, gap, between, the, paleolithic, and, the, neolithic, louis, leakey, provided, something, of, an, answer, by, proving, that, man, evolved, in, africa, the, stone, age, must, have, begun, there, to, be, carried, repeatedly, to, europe, by, migrant, populations, the, different, phases, of, the, stone, age, thus, could, appear, there, without, transitions, the, burden, on, african, archaeologists, became, all, the, greater, because, now, they, must, find, the, missing, transitions, in, africa, the, problem, is, difficult, and, ongoing, after, its, adoption, by, the, first, pan, african, congress, in, 1947, the, three, stage, chronology, was, amended, by, the, third, congress, in, 1955, to, include, a, first, intermediate, period, between, early, and, middle, to, encompass, the, fauresmith, and, sangoan, technologies, and, the, second, intermediate, period, between, middle, and, later, to, encompass, the, magosian, technology, and, others, the, chronologic, basis, for, the, definition, was, entirely, relative, with, the, arrival, of, scientific, means, of, finding, an, absolute, chronology, the, two, intermediates, turned, out, to, be, will, of, the, wisps, they, were, in, fact, middle, and, lower, paleolithic, fauresmith, is, now, considered, to, be, a, facies, of, acheulean, while, sangoan, is, a, facies, of, lupemban, magosian, is, an, artificial, mix, of, two, different, periods, once, seriously, questioned, the, intermediates, did, not, wait, for, the, next, pan, african, congress, two, years, hence, but, were, officially, rejected, in, 1965, again, on, an, advisory, basis, by, burg, wartenstein, conference, 29, systematic, investigation, of, the, african, later, tertiary, and, quaternary, a, conference, in, anthropology, held, by, the, wenner, gren, foundation, at, burg, wartenstein, castle, which, it, then, owned, in, austria, attended, by, the, same, scholars, that, attended, the, pan, african, congress, including, louis, leakey, and, mary, leakey, who, was, delivering, a, pilot, presentation, of, her, typological, analysis, of, early, stone, age, tools, to, be, included, in, her, 1971, contribution, to, olduvai, gorge, excavations, in, beds, i, and, ii, 1960, 1963, however, although, the, intermediate, periods, were, gone, the, search, for, the, transitions, continued, in, 1859, jens, jacob, worsaae, first, proposed, a, division, of, the, stone, age, into, older, and, younger, parts, based, on, his, work, with, danish, kitchen, middens, that, began, in, 1851, in, the, subsequent, decades, this, simple, distinction, developed, into, the, archaeological, periods, of, today, the, major, subdivisions, of, the, three, age, stone, age, cross, two, epoch, boundaries, on, the, geologic, time, scale, the, succession, of, these, phases, varies, enormously, from, one, region, and, culture, to, another, the, paleolithic, or, palaeolithic, from, greek, palaios, old, and, lithos, stone, lit, old, stone, coined, by, archaeologist, john, lubbock, and, published, in, 1865, is, the, earliest, division, of, the, stone, age, it, covers, the, greatest, portion, of, humanity, s, time, roughly, 99, of, human, technological, history, where, human, and, humanity, are, interpreted, to, mean, the, genus, homo, extending, from, 2, 5, or, 2, 6, million, years, ago, with, the, first, documented, use, of, stone, tools, by, hominans, such, as, homo, habilis, to, the, end, of, the, pleistocene, around, 10, 000, bc, the, paleolithic, era, ended, with, the, mesolithic, or, in, areas, with, an, early, neolithisation, the, epipaleolithic, at, sites, dating, from, the, lower, paleolithic, period, about, 2, 500, 000, to, 200, 000, years, ago, simple, pebble, tools, have, been, found, in, association, with, the, remains, of, what, may, have, been, the, earliest, human, ancestors, a, somewhat, more, sophisticated, lower, paleolithic, tradition, known, as, the, chopper, chopping, tool, industry, is, widely, distributed, in, the, eastern, hemisphere, this, tradition, is, thought, to, have, been, the, work, of, the, hominin, species, named, homo, erectus, although, no, such, fossil, tools, have, yet, been, found, it, is, believed, that, h, erectus, probably, made, tools, of, wood, and, bone, as, well, as, stone, about, 700, 000, years, ago, a, new, lower, paleolithic, tool, the, hand, axe, appeared, the, earliest, european, hand, axes, are, assigned, to, the, abbevillian, industry, which, developed, in, northern, france, in, the, valley, of, the, somme, river, a, later, more, refined, hand, axe, tradition, is, seen, in, the, acheulian, industry, evidence, of, which, has, been, found, in, europe, africa, the, middle, east, and, asia, some, of, the, earliest, known, hand, axes, were, found, at, olduvai, gorge, tanzania, in, association, with, remains, of, h, erectus, alongside, the, hand, axe, tradition, there, developed, a, distinct, and, very, different, stone, tool, industry, based, on, flakes, of, stone, special, tools, were, made, from, worked, carefully, shaped, flakes, of, flint, in, europe, the, clactonian, industry, is, one, example, of, a, flake, tradition, the, early, flake, industries, probably, contributed, to, the, development, of, the, middle, paleolithic, flake, tools, of, the, mousterian, industry, which, is, associated, with, the, remains, of, neanderthal, man, the, earliest, documented, stone, tools, have, been, found, in, eastern, africa, manufacturers, unknown, at, the, 3, 3, million, year, old, site, of, lomekwi, 3, in, kenya, better, known, are, the, later, tools, belonging, to, an, industry, known, as, oldowan, after, the, type, site, of, olduvai, gorge, in, tanzania, the, tools, were, formed, by, knocking, pieces, off, a, river, pebble, or, stones, like, it, with, a, hammerstone, to, obtain, large, and, small, pieces, with, one, or, more, sharp, edges, the, original, stone, is, called, a, core, the, resultant, pieces, flakes, typically, but, not, necessarily, small, pieces, are, detached, from, a, larger, piece, in, which, case, the, larger, piece, may, be, called, the, core, and, the, smaller, pieces, the, flakes, the, prevalent, usage, however, is, to, call, all, the, results, flakes, which, can, be, confusing, a, split, in, half, is, called, bipolar, flaking, consequently, the, method, is, often, called, core, and, flake, more, recently, the, tradition, has, been, called, small, flake, since, the, flakes, were, small, compared, to, subsequent, acheulean, tools, the, essence, of, the, oldowan, is, the, making, and, often, immediate, use, of, small, flakes, another, naming, scheme, is, pebble, core, technology, pbc, pebble, cores, are, artifacts, that, have, been, shaped, by, varying, amounts, of, hard, hammer, percussion, various, refinements, in, the, shape, have, been, called, choppers, discoids, polyhedrons, subspheroid, etc, to, date, no, reasons, for, the, variants, have, been, ascertained, from, a, functional, standpoint, pebble, cores, seem, designed, for, no, specific, purpose, however, they, would, not, have, been, manufactured, for, no, purpose, pebble, cores, can, be, useful, in, many, cutting, scraping, or, chopping, tasks, but, they, are, not, particularly, more, efficient, in, such, tasks, than, a, sharp, edged, rock, the, whole, point, of, their, utility, is, that, each, is, a, sharp, edged, rock, in, locations, where, nature, has, not, provided, any, there, is, additional, evidence, that, oldowan, or, mode, 1, tools, were, used, in, percussion, technology, that, is, they, were, designed, to, be, gripped, at, the, blunt, end, and, strike, something, with, the, edge, from, which, use, they, were, given, the, name, of, choppers, modern, science, has, been, able, to, detect, mammalian, blood, cells, on, mode, 1, tools, at, sterkfontein, member, 5, east, in, south, africa, as, the, blood, must, have, come, from, a, fresh, kill, the, tool, users, are, likely, to, have, done, the, killing, and, used, the, tools, for, butchering, plant, residues, bonded, to, the, silicon, of, some, tools, confirm, the, use, to, chop, plants, although, the, exact, species, authoring, the, tools, remains, unknown, mode, 1, tools, in, africa, were, manufactured, and, used, predominantly, by, homo, habilis, they, cannot, be, said, to, have, developed, these, tools, or, to, have, contributed, the, tradition, to, technology, they, continued, a, tradition, of, yet, unknown, origin, as, chimpanzees, sometimes, naturally, use, percussion, to, extract, or, prepare, food, in, the, wild, and, may, use, either, unmodified, stones, or, stones, that, they, have, split, creating, an, oldowan, tool, the, tradition, may, well, be, far, older, than, its, current, record, towards, the, end, of, oldowan, in, africa, a, new, species, appeared, over, the, range, of, homo, habilis, homo, erectus, the, earliest, unambiguous, evidence, is, a, whole, cranium, knm, er, 3733, a, find, identifier, from, koobi, fora, in, kenya, dated, to, 1, 78, mya, an, early, skull, fragment, knm, er, 2598, dated, to, 1, 9, mya, is, considered, a, good, candidate, also, transitions, in, paleoanthropology, are, always, hard, to, find, if, not, impossible, but, based, on, the, long, legged, limb, morphology, shared, by, h, habilis, and, h, rudolfensis, in, east, africa, an, evolution, from, one, of, those, two, has, been, suggested, the, most, immediate, cause, of, the, new, adjustments, appears, to, have, been, an, increasing, aridity, in, the, region, and, consequent, contraction, of, parkland, savanna, interspersed, with, trees, and, groves, in, favor, of, open, grassland, dated, 1, 8, 1, 7, mya, during, that, transitional, period, the, percentage, of, grazers, among, the, fossil, species, increased, from, around, 15, 25, to, 45, dispersing, the, food, supply, and, requiring, a, facility, among, the, hunters, to, travel, longer, distances, comfortably, which, h, erectus, obviously, had, the, ultimate, proof, is, the, dispersal, of, h, erectus, across, much, of, africa, and, asia, substantially, before, the, development, of, the, mode, 2, technology, and, use, of, fire, h, erectus, carried, mode, 1, tools, over, eurasia, according, to, the, current, evidence, which, may, change, at, any, time, mode, 1, tools, are, documented, from, about, 2, 6, mya, to, about, 1, 5, mya, in, africa, and, to, 0, 5, mya, outside, of, it, the, genus, homo, is, known, from, h, habilis, and, h, rudolfensis, from, 2, 3, to, 2, 0, mya, with, the, latest, habilis, being, an, upper, jaw, from, koobi, fora, kenya, from, 1, 4, mya, h, erectus, is, dated, 1, 8, 0, 6, mya, according, to, this, chronology, mode, 1, was, inherited, by, homo, from, unknown, hominans, probably, australopithecus, and, paranthropus, who, must, have, continued, on, with, mode, 1, and, then, with, mode, 2, until, their, extinction, no, later, than, 1, 1, mya, meanwhile, living, contemporaneously, in, the, same, regions, h, habilis, inherited, the, tools, around, 2, 3, mya, at, about, 1, 9, mya, h, erectus, came, on, stage, and, lived, contemporaneously, with, the, others, mode, 1, was, now, being, shared, by, a, number, of, hominans, over, the, same, ranges, presumably, subsisting, in, different, niches, but, the, archaeology, is, not, precise, enough, to, say, which, tools, of, the, oldowan, tradition, first, came, to, archaeological, attention, in, europe, where, being, intrusive, and, not, well, defined, compared, to, the, acheulean, they, were, puzzling, to, archaeologists, the, mystery, would, be, elucidated, by, african, archaeology, at, olduvai, but, meanwhile, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, term, pre, acheulean, came, into, use, in, climatology, c, e, p, brooks, a, british, climatologist, working, in, the, united, states, used, the, term, to, describe, a, chalky, boulder, clay, underlying, a, layer, of, gravel, at, hoxne, central, england, where, acheulean, tools, had, been, found, whether, any, tools, would, be, found, in, it, and, what, type, was, not, known, hugo, obermaier, a, contemporary, german, archaeologist, working, in, spain, quipped, unfortunately, the, stage, of, human, industry, which, corresponds, to, these, deposits, cannot, be, positively, identified, all, we, can, say, is, that, it, is, pre, acheulean, this, uncertainty, was, clarified, by, the, subsequent, excavations, at, olduvai, nevertheless, the, term, is, still, in, use, for, pre, acheulean, contexts, mainly, across, eurasia, that, are, yet, unspecified, or, uncertain, but, with, the, understanding, that, they, are, or, will, turn, out, to, be, pebble, tool, there, are, ample, associations, of, mode, 2, with, h, erectus, in, eurasia, h, erectus, mode, 1, associations, are, scantier, but, they, do, exist, especially, in, the, far, east, one, strong, piece, of, evidence, prevents, the, conclusion, that, only, h, erectus, reached, eurasia, at, yiron, israel, mode, 1, tools, have, been, found, dating, to, 2, 4, mya, about, 0, 5, my, earlier, than, the, known, h, erectus, finds, if, the, date, is, correct, either, another, hominan, preceded, h, erectus, out, of, africa, or, the, earliest, h, erectus, has, yet, to, be, found, after, the, initial, appearance, at, gona, in, ethiopia, at, 2, 7, mya, pebble, tools, date, from, 2, 0, mya, at, sterkfontein, member, 5, south, africa, and, from, 1, 8, mya, at, el, kherba, algeria, north, africa, the, manufacturers, had, already, left, pebble, tools, at, yiron, israel, at, 2, 4, mya, riwat, pakistan, at, 2, 0, mya, and, renzidong, south, china, at, over, 2, mya, the, identification, of, a, fossil, skull, at, mojokerta, pernung, peninsula, on, java, dated, to, 1, 8, mya, as, h, erectus, suggests, that, the, african, finds, are, not, the, earliest, to, be, found, in, africa, or, that, in, fact, erectus, did, not, originate, in, africa, after, all, but, on, the, plains, of, asia, the, outcome, of, the, issue, waits, for, more, substantial, evidence, erectus, was, found, also, at, dmanisi, georgia, from, 1, 75, mya, in, association, with, pebble, tools, pebble, tools, are, found, the, latest, first, in, southern, europe, and, then, in, northern, they, begin, in, the, open, areas, of, italy, and, spain, the, earliest, dated, to, 1, 6, mya, at, pirro, nord, italy, the, mountains, of, italy, are, rising, at, a, rapid, rate, in, the, framework, of, geologic, time, at, 1, 6, mya, they, were, lower, and, covered, with, grassland, as, much, of, the, highlands, still, are, europe, was, otherwise, mountainous, and, covered, over, with, dense, forest, a, formidable, terrain, for, warm, weather, savanna, dwellers, similarly, there, is, no, evidence, that, the, mediterranean, was, passable, at, gibraltar, or, anywhere, else, to, h, erectus, or, earlier, hominans, they, might, have, reached, italy, and, spain, along, the, coasts, in, northern, europe, pebble, tools, are, found, earliest, at, happisburgh, united, kingdom, from, 0, 8, mya, the, last, traces, are, from, kent, s, cavern, dated, 0, 5, mya, by, that, time, h, erectus, is, regarded, as, having, been, extinct, however, a, more, modern, version, apparently, had, evolved, homo, heidelbergensis, who, must, have, inherited, the, tools, he, also, explains, the, last, of, the, acheulean, in, germany, at, 0, 4, mya, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, archaeologists, worked, on, the, assumption, that, a, succession, of, hominans, and, cultures, prevailed, that, one, replaced, another, today, the, presence, of, multiple, hominans, living, contemporaneously, near, each, other, for, long, periods, is, accepted, as, proven, true, moreover, by, the, time, the, previously, assumed, earliest, culture, arrived, in, northern, europe, the, rest, of, africa, and, eurasia, had, progressed, to, the, middle, and, upper, palaeolithic, so, that, across, the, earth, all, three, were, for, a, time, contemporaneous, in, any, given, region, there, was, a, progression, from, oldowan, to, acheulean, lower, to, upper, no, doubt, the, end, of, oldowan, in, africa, was, brought, on, by, the, appearance, of, acheulean, or, mode, 2, stone, tools, the, earliest, known, instances, are, in, the, 1, 7, 1, 6, mya, layer, at, kokiselei, west, turkana, kenya, at, sterkfontein, south, africa, they, are, in, member, 5, west, 1, 7, 1, 4, mya, the, 1, 7, is, a, fairly, certain, fairly, standard, date, mode, 2, is, often, found, in, association, with, h, erectus, it, makes, sense, that, the, most, advanced, tools, should, have, been, innovated, by, the, most, advanced, hominan, consequently, they, are, typically, given, credit, for, the, innovation, a, mode, 2, tool, is, a, biface, consisting, of, two, concave, surfaces, intersecting, to, form, a, cutting, edge, all, the, way, around, except, in, the, case, of, tools, intended, to, feature, a, point, more, work, and, planning, go, into, the, manufacture, of, a, mode, 2, tool, the, manufacturer, hits, a, slab, off, a, larger, rock, to, use, as, a, blank, then, large, flakes, are, struck, off, the, blank, and, worked, into, bifaces, by, hard, hammer, percussion, on, an, anvil, stone, finally, the, edge, is, retouched, small, flakes, are, hit, off, with, a, bone, or, wood, soft, hammer, to, sharpen, or, resharpen, it, the, core, can, be, either, the, blank, or, another, flake, blanks, are, ported, for, manufacturing, supply, in, places, where, nature, has, provided, no, suitable, stone, although, most, mode, 2, tools, are, easily, distinguished, from, mode, 1, there, is, a, close, similarity, of, some, oldowan, and, some, acheulean, which, can, lead, to, confusion, some, oldowan, tools, are, more, carefully, prepared, to, form, a, more, regular, edge, one, distinguishing, criterion, is, the, size, of, the, flakes, in, contrast, to, the, oldowan, small, flake, tradition, acheulean, is, large, flake, the, primary, technological, distinction, remaining, between, oldowan, and, the, acheulean, is, the, preference, for, large, flakes, 10, cm, as, blanks, for, making, large, cutting, tools, handaxes, and, cleavers, in, the, acheulean, large, cutting, tool, lct, has, become, part, of, the, standard, terminology, as, well, in, north, africa, the, presence, of, mode, 2, remains, a, mystery, as, the, oldest, finds, are, from, thomas, quarry, in, morocco, at, 0, 9, mya, archaeological, attention, however, shifts, to, the, jordan, rift, valley, an, extension, of, the, east, african, rift, valley, the, east, bank, of, the, jordan, is, slowly, sliding, northward, as, east, africa, is, thrust, away, from, africa, evidence, of, use, of, the, nile, valley, is, in, deficit, but, hominans, could, easily, have, reached, the, palaeo, jordan, river, from, ethiopia, along, the, shores, of, the, red, sea, one, side, or, the, other, a, crossing, would, not, have, been, necessary, but, it, is, more, likely, there, than, over, a, theoretical, but, unproven, land, bridge, through, either, gibraltar, or, sicily, meanwhile, acheulean, went, on, in, africa, past, the, 1, 0, mya, mark, and, also, past, the, extinction, of, h, erectus, there, the, last, acheulean, in, east, africa, is, at, olorgesailie, kenya, dated, to, about, 0, 9, mya, its, owner, was, still, h, erectus, but, in, south, africa, acheulean, at, elandsfontein, 1, 0, 0, 6, mya, is, associated, with, saldanha, man, classified, as, h, heidelbergensis, a, more, advanced, but, not, yet, modern, descendant, most, likely, of, h, erectus, the, thoman, quarry, hominans, in, morocco, similarly, are, most, likely, homo, rhodesiensis, in, the, same, evolutionary, status, as, h, heidelbergensis, mode, 2, is, first, known, out, of, africa, at, ubeidiya, israel, a, site, now, on, the, jordan, river, then, frequented, over, the, long, term, hundreds, of, thousands, of, years, by, homo, on, the, shore, of, a, variable, level, palaeo, lake, long, since, vanished, the, geology, was, created, by, successive, transgression, and, regression, of, the, lake, resulting, in, four, cycles, of, layers, the, tools, are, located, in, the, first, two, cycles, li, limnic, inferior, and, fi, fluviatile, inferior, but, mostly, in, fi, the, cycles, represent, different, ecologies, and, therefore, different, cross, sections, of, fauna, which, makes, it, possible, to, date, them, they, appear, to, be, the, same, faunal, assemblages, as, the, ferenta, faunal, unit, in, italy, known, from, excavations, at, selvella, and, pieterfitta, dated, to, 1, 6, 1, 2, mya, at, ubeidiya, the, marks, on, the, bones, of, the, animal, species, found, there, indicate, that, the, manufacturers, of, the, tools, butchered, the, kills, of, large, predators, an, activity, that, has, been, termed, scavenging, there, are, no, living, floors, nor, did, they, process, bones, to, obtain, the, marrow, these, activities, cannot, be, understood, therefore, as, the, only, or, even, the, typical, economic, activity, of, hominans, their, interests, were, selective, they, were, primarily, harvesting, the, meat, of, cervids, which, is, estimated, to, have, been, available, without, spoiling, for, up, to, four, days, after, the, kill, the, majority, of, the, animals, at, the, site, were, of, palaearctic, biogeographic, origin, however, these, overlapped, in, range, on, 30, 60, of, african, biogeographic, origin, the, biome, was, mediterranean, not, savanna, the, animals, were, not, passing, through, there, was, simply, an, overlap, of, normal, ranges, of, the, hominans, h, erectus, left, several, cranial, fragments, teeth, of, undetermined, species, may, have, been, h, ergaster, the, tools, are, classified, as, lower, acheulean, and, developed, oldowan, the, latter, is, a, disputed, classification, created, by, mary, leakey, to, describe, an, acheulean, like, tradition, in, bed, ii, at, olduvai, it, is, dated, 1, 53, 1, 27, mya, the, date, of, the, tools, therefore, probably, does, not, exceed, 1, 5, mya, 1, 4, is, often, given, as, a, date, this, chronology, which, is, definitely, later, than, in, kenya, supports, the, out, of, africa, hypothesis, for, acheulean, if, not, for, the, hominans, from, southwest, asia, as, the, levant, is, now, called, the, acheulean, extended, itself, more, slowly, eastward, arriving, at, isampur, india, about, 1, 2, mya, it, does, not, appear, in, china, and, korea, until, after, 1mya, and, not, at, all, in, indonesia, there, is, a, discernible, boundary, marking, the, furthest, extent, of, the, acheulean, eastward, before, 1, mya, called, the, movius, line, after, its, proposer, hallam, l, movius, on, the, east, side, of, the, line, the, small, flake, tradition, continues, but, the, tools, are, additionally, worked, mode, 1, with, flaking, down, the, sides, in, athirampakkam, at, chennai, in, tamil, nadu, the, acheulean, age, started, at, 1, 51, mya, and, it, is, also, prior, than, north, india, and, europe, the, cause, of, the, movius, line, remains, speculative, whether, it, represents, a, real, change, in, technology, or, a, limitation, of, archeology, but, after, 1, mya, evidence, not, available, to, movius, indicates, the, prevalence, of, acheulean, for, example, the, acheulean, site, at, bose, china, is, dated, 0, 803, 3k, mya, the, authors, of, this, chronologically, later, east, asian, acheulean, remain, unknown, as, does, whether, it, evolved, in, the, region, or, was, brought, in, there, is, no, named, boundary, line, between, mode, 1, and, mode, 2, on, the, west, nevertheless, mode, 2, is, equally, late, in, europe, as, it, is, in, the, far, east, the, earliest, comes, from, a, rock, shelter, at, estrecho, de, qu, par, in, spain, dated, to, greater, than, 0, 9, mya, teeth, from, an, undetermined, hominan, were, found, there, also, the, last, mode, 2, in, southern, europe, is, from, a, deposit, at, fontana, ranuccio, near, anagni, in, italy, dated, to, 0, 45, mya, which, is, generally, linked, to, homo, cepranensis, a, late, variant, of, h, erectus, a, fragment, of, whose, skull, was, found, at, ceprano, nearby, dated, 0, 46, mya, this, period, is, best, known, as, the, era, during, which, the, neanderthals, lived, in, europe, and, the, near, east, c, 300, 000, 28, 000, years, ago, their, technology, is, mainly, the, mousterian, but, neanderthal, physical, characteristics, have, been, found, also, in, ambiguous, association, with, the, more, recent, ch, telperronian, archeological, culture, in, western, europe, and, several, local, industries, like, the, szeletian, in, eastern, europe, eurasia, there, is, no, evidence, for, neanderthals, in, africa, australia, or, the, americas, neanderthals, nursed, their, elderly, and, practised, ritual, burial, indicating, an, organised, society, the, earliest, evidence, mungo, man, of, settlement, in, australia, dates, to, around, 40, 000, years, ago, when, modern, humans, likely, crossed, from, asia, by, island, hopping, evidence, for, symbolic, behavior, such, as, body, ornamentation, and, burial, is, ambiguous, for, the, middle, paleolithic, and, still, subject, to, debate, the, bhimbetka, rock, shelters, exhibit, the, earliest, traces, of, human, life, in, india, some, of, which, are, approximately, 30, 000, years, old, from, 50, 000, to, 10, 000,

further, across, the, earth, during, the, period, known, as, the, upper, paleolithic, the, upper, paleolithic, is, marked, by, a, relatively, rapid, succession, of, often, complex, stone, artifact, technologies, and, a, large, increase, in, the, creation, of, art, and, personal, ornaments, during, period, between, 35, and, 10, kya, evolved, from, 38, to, 30, kya, ch, telperronian, 40, 28, aurignacian, 28, 22, gravettian, 22, 17, solutrean, and, 18, 10, magdalenian, all, of, these, industries, except, the, ch, telperronian, are, associated, with, anatomically, modern, humans, authorship, of, the, ch, telperronian, is, still, the, subject, of, much, debate, most, scholars, date, the, arrival, of, humans, in, australia, at, 40, 000, to, 50, 000, years, ago, with, a, possible, range, of, up, to, 125, 000, years, ago, the, earliest, anatomically, modern, human, remains, found, in, australia, and, outside, of, africa, are, those, of, mungo, man, they, have, been, dated, at, 42, 000, years, old, the, americas, were, colonised, via, the, bering, land, bridge, which, was, exposed, during, this, period, by, lower, sea, levels, these, people, are, called, the, paleo, indians, and, the, earliest, accepted, dates, are, those, of, the, clovis, culture, sites, some, 13, 500, years, ago, globally, societies, were, hunter, gatherers, but, evidence, of, regional, identities, begins, to, appear, in, the, wide, variety, of, stone, tool, types, being, developed, to, suit, very, different, environments, the, period, starting, from, the, end, of, the, last, ice, age, 10, 000, years, ago, to, around, 6, 000, years, ago, was, characterized, by, rising, sea, levels, and, a, need, to, adapt, to, a, changing, environment, and, find, new, food, sources, the, development, of, mode, 5, microlith, tools, began, in, response, to, these, changes, they, were, derived, from, the, previous, paleolithic, tools, hence, the, term, epipaleolithic, or, were, intermediate, between, the, paleolithic, and, the, neolithic, hence, the, term, mesolithic, middle, stone, age, used, for, parts, of, eurasia, but, not, outside, it, the, choice, of, a, word, depends, on, exact, circumstances, and, the, inclination, of, the, archaeologists, excavating, the, site, microliths, were, used, in, the, manufacture, of, more, efficient, composite, tools, resulting, in, an, intensification, of, hunting, and, fishing, and, with, increasing, social, activity, the, development, of, more, complex, settlements, such, as, lepenski, vir, domestication, of, the, dog, as, a, hunting, companion, probably, dates, to, this, period, the, earliest, known, battle, occurred, during, the, mesolithic, period, at, a, site, in, egypt, known, as, cemetery, 117, the, neolithic, or, new, stone, age, was, approximately, characterized, by, the, adoption, of, agriculture, the, shift, from, food, gathering, to, food, producing, in, itself, one, of, the, most, revolutionary, changes, in, human, history, was, accompanied, by, the, so, called, neolithic, revolution, the, development, of, pottery, polished, stone, tools, and, construction, of, more, complex, larger, settlements, such, as, g, bekli, tepe, and, atalh, y, k, some, of, these, features, began, in, certain, localities, even, earlier, in, the, transitional, mesolithic, the, first, neolithic, cultures, started, around, 7000, bc, in, the, fertile, crescent, and, spread, concentrically, to, other, areas, of, the, world, however, the, near, east, was, probably, not, the, only, nucleus, of, agriculture, the, cultivation, of, maize, in, meso, america, and, of, rice, in, the, far, east, being, others, due, to, the, increased, need, to, harvest, and, process, plants, ground, stone, and, polished, stone, artifacts, became, much, more, widespread, including, tools, for, grinding, cutting, and, chopping, skara, brae, located, in, orkney, off, scotland, is, one, of, europe, s, best, examples, of, a, neolithic, village, the, community, contains, stone, beds, shelves, and, even, an, indoor, toilet, linked, to, a, stream, the, first, large, scale, constructions, were, built, including, settlement, towers, and, walls, e, g, jericho, tell, es, sultan, and, ceremonial, sites, e, g, stonehenge, the, gantija, temples, of, gozo, in, the, maltese, archipelago, are, the, oldest, surviving, free, standing, structures, in, the, world, erected, c, 3600, 2500, bc, the, earliest, evidence, for, established, trade, exists, in, the, neolithic, with, newly, settled, people, importing, exotic, goods, over, distances, of, many, hundreds, of, miles, these, facts, show, that, there, were, sufficient, resources, and, co, operation, to, enable, large, groups, to, work, on, these, projects, to, what, extent, this, was, a, basis, for, the, development, of, elites, and, social, hierarchies, is, a, matter, of, ongoing, debate, although, some, late, neolithic, societies, formed, complex, stratified, chiefdoms, similar, to, polynesian, societies, such, as, the, ancient, hawaiians, based, on, the, societies, of, modern, tribesmen, at, an, equivalent, technological, level, most, neolithic, societies, were, relatively, simple, and, egalitarian, a, comparison, of, art, in, the, two, ages, leads, some, theorists, to, conclude, that, neolithic, cultures, were, noticeably, more, hierarchical, than, the, paleolithic, cultures, that, preceded, them, the, early, stone, age, in, africa, is, not, to, be, identified, with, old, stone, age, a, translation, of, paleolithic, or, with, paleolithic, or, with, the, earlier, stone, age, that, originally, meant, what, became, the, paleolithic, and, mesolithic, in, the, initial, decades, of, its, definition, by, the, pan, african, congress, of, prehistory, it, was, parallel, in, africa, to, the, upper, and, middle, paleolithic, however, since, then, radiocarbon, dating, has, shown, that, the, middle, stone, age, is, in, fact, contemporaneous, with, the, middle, paleolithic, the, early, stone, age, therefore, is, contemporaneous, with, the, lower, paleolithic, and, happens, to, include, the, same, main, technologies, oldowan, and, acheulean, which, produced, mode, 1, and, mode, 2, stone, tools, respectively, a, distinct, regional, term, is, warranted, however, by, the, location, and, chronology, of, the, sites, and, the, exact, typology, the, middle, stone, age, was, a, period, of, african, prehistory, between, early, stone, age, and, late, stone, age, it, began, around, 300, 000, years, ago, and, ended, around, 50, 000, years, ago, it, is, considered, as, an, equivalent, of, european, middle, paleolithic, it, is, associated, with, anatomically, modern, or, almost, modern, homo, sapiens, early, physical, evidence, comes, from, omo, and, herto, both, in, ethiopia, and, dated, respectively, at, c, 195, ka, and, at, c, 160, ka, the, later, stone, age, lsa, sometimes, also, called, the, late, stone, age, refers, to, a, period, in, african, prehistory, its, beginnings, are, roughly, contemporaneous, with, the, european, upper, paleolithic, it, lasts, until, historical, times, and, this, includes, cultures, corresponding, to, mesolithic, and, neolithic, in, other, regions, stone, tools, were, made, from, a, variety, of, stones, for, example, flint, and, chert, were, shaped, or, chipped, for, use, as, cutting, tools, and, weapons, while, basalt, and, sandstone, were, used, for, ground, stone, tools, such, as, quern, stones, wood, bone, shell, antler, deer, and, other, materials, were, widely, used, as, well, during, the, most, recent, part, of, the, period, sediments, such, as, clay, were, used, to, make, pottery, agriculture, was, developed, and, certain, animals, were, domesticated, as, well, some, species, of, non, primates, are, able, to, use, stone, tools, such, as, the, sea, otter, which, breaks, abalone, shells, with, them, primates, can, both, use, and, manufacture, stone, tools, this, combination, of, abilities, is, more, marked, in, apes, and, men, but, only, men, or, more, generally, hominans, depend, on, tool, use, for, survival, the, key, anatomical, and, behavioral, features, required, for, tool, manufacture, which, are, possessed, only, by, hominans, are, the, larger, thumb, and, the, ability, to, hold, by, means, of, an, assortment, of, grips, food, sources, of, the, palaeolithic, hunter, gatherers, were, wild, plants, and, animals, harvested, from, the, environment, they, liked, animal, organ, meats, including, the, livers, kidneys, and, brains, large, seeded, legumes, were, part, of, the, human, diet, long, before, the, agricultural, revolution, as, is, evident, from, archaeobotanical, finds, from, the, mousterian, layers, of, kebara, cave, in, israel, moreover, recent, evidence, indicates, that, humans, processed, and, consumed, wild, cereal, grains, as, far, back, as, 23, 000, years, ago, in, the, upper, paleolithic, near, the, end, of, the, wisconsin, glaciation, 15, 000, to, 9, 000, years, ago, mass, extinction, of, megafauna, such, as, the, woolly, mammoth, occurred, in, asia, europe, north, america, and, australia, this, was, the, first, holocene, extinction, event, it, possibly, forced, modification, in, the, dietary, habits, of, the, humans, of, that, age, and, with, the, emergence, of, agricultural, practices, plant, based, foods, also, became, a, regular, part, of, the, diet, a, number, of, factors, have, been, suggested, for, the, extinction, certainly, over, hunting, but, also, deforestation, and, climate, change, the, net, effect, was, to, fragment, the, vast, ranges, required, by, the, large, animals, and, extinguish, them, piecemeal, in, each, fragment, around, 2, million, years, ago, homo, habilis, is, believed, to, have, constructed, the, first, man, made, structure, in, east, africa, consisting, of, simple, arrangements, of, stones, to, hold, branches, of, trees, in, position, a, similar, stone, circular, arrangement, believed, to, be, around, 380, 000, years, old, was, discovered, at, terra, amata, near, nice, france, concerns, about, the, dating, have, been, raised, see, terra, amata, several, human, habitats, dating, back, to, the, stone, age, have, been, discovered, around, the, globe, including, prehistoric, art, is, visible, in, the, artifacts, prehistoric, music, is, inferred, from, found, instruments, while, parietal, art, can, be, found, on, rocks, of, any, kind, the, latter, are, petroglyphs, and, rock, paintings, the, art, may, or, may, not, have, had, a, religious, function, petroglyphs, appeared, in, the, neolithic, a, petroglyph, is, an, intaglio, abstract, or, symbolic, image, engraved, on, natural, stone, by, various, methods, usually, by, prehistoric, peoples, they, were, a, dominant, form, of, pre, writing, symbols, petroglyphs, have, been, discovered, in, different, parts, of, the, world, including, australia, sydney, rock, engravings, asia, bhimbetka, india, north, america, death, valley, national, park, south, america, cumbe, mayo, peru, and, europe, finnmark, norway, in, paleolithic, times, mostly, animals, were, painted, in, theory, ones, that, were, used, as, food, or, represented, strength, such, as, the, rhinoceros, or, large, cats, as, in, the, chauvet, cave, signs, such, as, dots, were, sometimes, drawn, rare, human, representations, include, handprints, and, half, human, half, animal, figures, the, cave, of, chauvet, in, the, ard, che, d, partement, france, contains, the, most, important, cave, paintings, of, the, paleolithic, era, dating, from, about, 36, 000, bc, the, altamira, cave, paintings, in, spain, were, done, 14, 000, to, 12, 000, bc, and, show, among, others, bisons, the, hall, of, bulls, in, lascaux, dordogne, france, dates, from, about, 15, 000, to, 10, 000, bc, the, meaning, of, many, of, these, paintings, remains, unknown, they, may, have, been, used, for, seasonal, rituals, the, animals, are, accompanied, by, signs, that, suggest, a, possible, magic, use, arrow, like, symbols, in, lascaux, are, sometimes, interpreted, as, calendar, or, almanac, use, but, the, evidence, remains, interpretative, some, scenes, of, the, mesolithic, however, can, be, typed, and, therefore, judging, from, their, various, modifications, are, fairly, clear, one, of, these, is, the, battle, scene, between, organized, bands, of, archers, for, example, the, marching, warriors, a, rock, painting, at, cingle, de, la, mola, castell, n, in, spain, dated, to, about, 7, 000, 4, 000, bc, depicts, about, 50, bowmen, in, two, groups, marching, or, running, in, step, toward, each, other, each, man, carrying, a, bow, in, one, hand, and, a, fistful, of, arrows, in, the, other, a, file, of, five, men, leads, one, band, one, of, whom, is, a, figure, with, a, high, crowned, hat, in, other, scenes, elsewhere, the, men, wear, head, dresses, and, knee, ornaments, but, otherwise, fight, nude, some, scenes, depict, the, dead, and, wounded, bristling, with, arrows, one, is, reminded, of, tzi, the, iceman, a, copper, age, mummy, revealed, by, an, alpine, melting, glacier, who, collapsed, from, loss, of, blood, due, to, an, arrow, wound, in, the, back, modern, studies, and, the, in, depth, analysis, of, finds, dating, from, the, stone, age, indicate, certain, rituals, and, beliefs, of, the, people, in, those, prehistoric, times, it, is, now, believed, that, activities, of, the, stone, age, humans, went, beyond, the, immediate, requirements, of, procuring, food, body, coverings, and, shelters, specific, rites, relating, to, death, and, burial, were, practiced, though, certainly, differing, in, style, and, execution, between, cultures, the, image, of, the, caveman, is, commonly, associated, with, the, stone, age, for, example, a, 2003, documentary, series, showing, the, evolution, of, humans, through, the, stone, age, was, called, walking, with, cavemen, but, only, the, last, programme, showed, humans, living, in, caves, while, the, idea, that, human, beings, and, dinosaurs, coexisted, is, sometimes, portrayed, in, popular, culture, in, cartoons, films, and, computer, games, such, as, the, flintstones, one, million, years, b, c, and, chuck, rock, the, notion, of, hominids, and, non, avian, dinosaurs, co, existing, is, not, supported, by, any, scientific, evidence, other, depictions, of, the, stone, age, include, the, best, selling, earth, s, children, series, of, books, by, jean, m, auel, which, are, set, in, the, paleolithic, and, are, loosely, based, on, archaeological, and, anthropological, findings, the, 1981, film, quest, for, fire, by, jean, jacques, annaud, tells, the, story, of, a, group, of, early, homo, sapiens, searching, for, their, lost, fire, a, 21st, century, series, chronicles, of, ancient, darkness, by, michelle, paver, tells, of, two, new, stone, age, children, fighting, to, fulfil, a, prophecy, and,
