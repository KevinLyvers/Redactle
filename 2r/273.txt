the, east, west, schism, also, known, as, the, great, schism, or, the, schism, of, 1054, is, the, break, of, communion, between, the, roman, catholic, and, eastern, orthodox, churches, since, 1054, a, series, of, ecclesiastical, differences, and, theological, disputes, between, the, greek, east, and, latin, west, preceded, the, formal, split, that, occurred, in, 1054, prominent, among, these, were, the, procession, of, the, holy, spirit, filioque, whether, leavened, or, unleavened, bread, should, be, used, in, the, eucharist, iconoclasm, the, coronation, of, charlemagne, as, emperor, of, the, romans, in, 800, the, pope, s, claim, to, universal, jurisdiction, and, the, place, of, the, see, of, constantinople, in, relation, to, the, pentarchy, the, first, action, that, would, lead, to, a, formal, schism, was, taken, in, 1053, patriarch, michael, i, cerularius, of, constantinople, ordered, the, closure, of, all, latin, churches, in, constantinople, in, 1054, the, papal, legate, sent, by, leo, ix, travelled, to, constantinople, in, order, among, other, things, to, deny, cerularius, the, title, of, ecumenical, patriarch, and, insist, that, he, recognize, the, pope, s, claim, to, be, the, head, of, all, of, the, churches, the, main, purposes, of, the, papal, legation, were, to, seek, help, from, the, byzantine, emperor, constantine, ix, monomachos, in, view, of, the, norman, conquest, of, southern, italy, and, to, respond, to, leo, of, ohrid, s, attacks, on, the, use, of, unleavened, bread, and, other, western, customs, attacks, that, had, the, support, of, cerularius, the, historian, axel, bayer, says, that, the, legation, was, sent, in, response, to, two, letters, one, from, the, emperor, seeking, help, to, organize, a, joint, military, campaign, by, the, eastern, and, western, empires, against, the, normans, and, the, other, from, cerularius, when, the, leader, of, the, legation, cardinal, humbert, of, silva, candida, o, s, b, learned, that, cerularius, had, refused, to, accept, the, demand, he, excommunicated, him, and, in, response, cerularius, excommunicated, humbert, and, the, other, legates, according, to, ware, even, after, 1054, friendly, relations, between, east, and, west, continued, the, two, parts, of, christendom, were, not, yet, conscious, of, a, great, gulf, of, separation, between, them, the, dispute, remained, something, of, which, ordinary, christians, in, east, and, west, were, largely, unaware, the, validity, of, the, western, legates, act, is, doubtful, because, pope, leo, had, died, and, cerularius, excommunication, only, applied, to, the, legates, personally, still, the, church, split, along, doctrinal, theological, linguistic, political, and, geographical, lines, and, the, fundamental, breach, has, never, been, healed, each, side, occasionally, accuses, the, other, of, committing, heresy, and, of, having, initiated, the, schism, reconciliation, was, made, more, difficult, by, the, latin, led, crusades, the, massacre, of, the, latins, in, 1182, the, west, s, retaliation, via, the, sacking, of, thessalonica, in, 1185, the, capture, and, pillaging, of, constantinople, during, the, fourth, crusade, in, 1204, and, the, imposition, of, latin, patriarchs, over, time, the, emergence, of, competing, greek, and, latin, hierarchies, in, the, crusader, states, especially, with, two, claimants, to, the, patriarchal, sees, of, antioch, constantinople, and, jerusalem, made, the, existence, of, a, schism, clear, several, attempts, at, reconciliation, did, not, bear, fruit, in, 1965, pope, paul, vi, and, ecumenical, patriarch, athenagoras, i, nullified, the, anathemas, of, 1054, although, this, was, a, nullification, of, measures, taken, against, only, a, few, individuals, merely, as, a, gesture, of, goodwill, and, not, constituting, any, sort, of, reunion, the, absence, of, full, communion, between, the, churches, is, even, explicitly, mentioned, when, the, code, of, canon, law, gives, catholic, ministers, permission, to, administer, the, sacraments, of, penance, the, eucharist, and, the, anointing, of, the, sick, to, members, of, eastern, churches, such, as, the, eastern, orthodox, church, as, well, as, the, oriental, orthodox, churches, and, the, church, of, the, east, and, members, of, western, churches, such, as, the, old, catholic, church, when, those, members, spontaneously, request, these, contacts, between, the, two, sides, continue, every, year, a, delegation, from, each, joins, in, the, other, s, celebration, of, its, patronal, feast, saints, peter, and, paul, 29, june, for, rome, and, saint, andrew, 30, november, for, constantinople, and, there, have, been, several, visits, by, the, head, of, each, to, the, other, the, efforts, of, the, ecumenical, patriarchs, towards, reconciliation, with, the, catholic, church, have, often, been, the, target, of, sharp, criticism, from, some, fellow, orthodox, scholars, have, proposed, different, dates, for, the, great, schism, ranging, from, 1009, to, 1204, jaroslav, pelikan, emphasizes, that, while, the, east, west, schism, stemmed, largely, from, political, and, ecclesiastical, discord, this, discord, also, reflected, basic, theological, differences, pelikan, further, argues, that, the, antagonists, in, the, 11th, century, inappropriately, exaggerated, their, theological, differences, whereas, modern, historians, tend, to, minimize, them, pelikan, asserts, that, the, documents, from, that, era, evidence, the, depths, of, intellectual, alienation, that, had, developed, between, the, two, sections, of, christendom, while, the, two, sides, were, technically, more, guilty, of, schism, than, heresy, they, often, charged, each, other, with, allegations, of, blasphemy, pelikan, describes, much, of, the, dispute, as, dealing, with, regional, differences, in, usages, and, customs, some, of, which, were, adiaphorous, i, e, neither, commanded, nor, forbidden, however, he, goes, on, to, say, that, while, it, was, easy, in, principle, to, accept, the, existence, of, adiaphora, it, was, difficult, in, actual, practice, to, distinguish, customs, which, were, innocuously, adiaphoric, from, those, that, had, doctrinal, implications, philip, sherrard, an, eastern, orthodox, theologian, asserts, that, the, underlying, cause, of, the, east, west, schism, was, and, continues, to, be, the, clash, of, these, two, fundamentally, irreconcilable, ecclesiologies, roger, haight, characterizes, the, question, of, episcopal, authority, in, the, church, as, acute, with, the, relative, standings, of, rome, and, constantinople, a, recurrent, source, of, tension, haight, characterizes, the, difference, in, ecclesiologies, as, the, contrast, between, a, pope, with, universal, jurisdiction, and, a, combination, of, the, patriarchal, superstructure, with, an, episcopal, and, synodal, communion, ecclesiology, analogous, to, that, found, in, cyprian, however, nicholas, afansiev, has, criticized, both, the, catholic, and, orthodox, churches, for, subscribing, to, the, universal, ecclesiology, of, st, cyprian, of, carthage, according, to, which, only, one, true, and, universal, church, can, exist, another, point, of, controversy, was, celibacy, among, western, priests, both, monastic, and, parish, as, opposed, to, the, eastern, discipline, whereby, parish, priests, could, be, married, men, however, the, latin, church, has, always, had, some, priests, who, were, legally, married, they, have, been, a, small, minority, since, the, 12th, century, there, are, several, different, ecclesiologies, communion, ecclesiology, eucharistic, ecclesiology, baptismal, ecclesiology, trinitarian, ecclesiology, kerygmatic, theology, other, ecclesiologies, are, the, hierarchical, institutional, and, the, organic, mystical, and, the, congregationalist, the, eastern, churches, maintained, the, idea, that, every, local, city, church, with, its, bishop, presbyters, deacons, and, people, celebrating, the, eucharist, constituted, the, whole, church, in, this, view, called, eucharistic, ecclesiology, or, more, recently, holographic, ecclesiology, every, bishop, is, saint, peter, s, successor, in, his, church, the, church, and, the, churches, form, what, eusebius, called, a, common, union, of, churches, this, implied, that, all, bishops, were, ontologically, equal, although, functionally, particular, bishops, could, be, granted, special, privileges, by, other, bishops, and, serve, as, metropolitans, archbishops, or, patriarchs, within, the, roman, empire, from, the, time, of, constantine, to, the, fall, of, the, empire, in, 1453, universal, ecclesiology, rather, than, eucharistic, became, the, operative, principle, the, view, prevailed, that, when, the, roman, empire, became, christian, the, perfect, world, order, willed, by, god, had, been, achieved, one, universal, empire, was, sovereign, and, coterminous, with, it, was, the, one, universal, church, early, on, the, roman, church, s, ecclesiology, was, universal, with, the, idea, that, the, church, was, a, worldwide, organism, with, a, divinely, not, functionally, appointed, center, the, church, bishop, of, rome, these, two, views, are, still, present, in, modern, eastern, orthodoxy, and, catholicism, and, can, be, seen, as, foundational, causes, for, the, schisms, and, great, schism, between, east, and, west, the, orthodox, church, does, not, accept, the, doctrine, of, papal, authority, set, forth, in, the, vatican, council, of, 1870, and, taught, today, in, the, catholic, church, the, orthodox, church, has, always, maintained, the, original, position, of, collegiality, of, the, bishops, resulting, in, the, structure, of, the, church, being, closer, to, a, confederacy, the, orthodox, have, synods, where, the, highest, authorities, in, each, church, community, are, brought, together, but, unlike, the, catholic, church, no, central, individual, or, figure, has, the, absolute, and, infallible, last, word, on, church, doctrine, in, practice, this, has, sometimes, led, to, divisions, among, greek, russian, bulgarian, and, ukrainian, orthodox, churches, as, no, central, authority, can, serve, as, an, arbitrator, for, various, internal, disputes, starting, from, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, eucharistic, ecclesiology, is, upheld, by, catholic, theologians, henri, de, lubac, writes, the, church, like, the, eucharist, is, a, mystery, of, unity, the, same, mystery, and, one, with, inexhaustible, riches, both, are, the, body, of, christ, the, same, body, joseph, ratzinger, called, eucharistic, ecclesiology, the, real, core, of, vatican, ii, s, second, vatican, council, teaching, on, the, cross, according, to, ratzinger, the, one, church, of, god, exists, in, no, other, way, than, in, the, various, individual, local, congregations, in, these, the, eucharist, is, celebrated, in, union, with, the, church, everywhere, eucharistic, ecclesiology, led, the, council, to, affirm, the, theological, significance, of, the, local, church, if, each, celebration, of, the, eucharist, is, a, matter, not, only, of, christ, s, sacramental, presence, on, the, altar, but, also, of, his, ecclesial, presence, in, the, gathered, community, then, each, local, eucharistic, church, must, be, more, than, a, subset, of, the, universal, church, it, must, be, the, body, of, christ, in, that, place, the, ecclesiological, dimension, of, the, east, west, schism, revolves, around, the, authority, of, bishops, within, their, dioceses, and, the, lines, of, authority, between, bishops, of, different, dioceses, it, is, common, for, catholics, to, insist, on, the, primacy, of, roman, and, papal, authority, based, on, patristic, writings, and, conciliar, documents, the, catholic, church, s, current, official, teachings, about, papal, privilege, and, power, that, are, unacceptable, to, the, eastern, orthodox, churches, are, the, dogma, of, the, pope, s, infallibility, when, speaking, officially, from, the, chair, of, peter, ex, cathedra, petri, on, matters, of, faith, and, morals, to, be, held, by, the, whole, church, so, that, such, definitions, are, irreformable, of, themselves, and, not, by, the, consent, of, the, church, ex, sese, et, non, ex, consensu, ecclesiae, and, have, a, binding, character, for, all, catholic, christians, in, the, world, the, pope, s, direct, episcopal, jurisdiction, over, all, catholic, christians, in, the, world, the, pope, s, authority, to, appoint, and, so, also, to, dismiss, the, bishops, of, all, catholic, christian, churches, except, in, the, territory, of, a, patriarchate, and, the, affirmation, that, the, legitimacy, and, authority, of, all, catholic, christian, bishops, in, the, world, derive, from, their, union, with, the, roman, see, and, its, bishop, the, supreme, pontiff, the, unique, successor, of, peter, and, vicar, of, christ, on, earth, principal, among, the, ecclesiastical, issues, that, separate, the, two, churches, is, the, meaning, of, papal, primacy, within, any, future, unified, church, the, orthodox, insist, that, it, should, be, a, primacy, of, honor, and, not, a, primacy, of, authority, whereas, the, catholics, see, the, pontiff, s, role, as, required, for, its, exercise, of, power, and, authority, the, exact, form, of, which, is, open, to, discussion, with, other, christians, according, to, eastern, orthodox, belief, the, test, of, catholicity, is, adherence, to, the, authority, of, scripture, and, then, by, the, holy, tradition, of, the, church, it, is, not, defined, by, adherence, to, any, particular, see, it, is, the, position, of, the, orthodox, church, that, it, has, never, accepted, the, pope, as, de, jure, leader, of, the, entire, church, referring, to, ignatius, of, antioch, carlton, says, contrary, to, popular, opinion, the, word, catholic, does, not, mean, universal, it, means, whole, complete, lacking, nothing, thus, to, confess, the, church, to, be, catholic, is, to, say, that, she, possesses, the, fullness, of, the, christian, faith, to, say, however, that, orthodox, and, rome, constitute, two, lungs, of, the, same, church, is, to, deny, that, either, church, separately, is, catholic, in, any, meaningful, sense, of, the, term, this, is, not, only, contrary, to, the, teaching, of, orthodoxy, it, is, flatly, contrary, to, the, teaching, of, the, roman, catholic, church, which, considered, itself, truly, catholic, the, church, is, in, the, image, of, the, trinity, and, reflects, the, reality, of, the, incarnation, the, body, of, christ, must, always, be, equal, with, itself, the, local, church, which, manifests, the, body, of, christ, cannot, be, subsumed, into, any, larger, organisation, or, collectivity, which, makes, it, more, catholic, and, more, in, unity, for, the, simple, reason, that, the, principle, of, total, catholicity, and, total, unity, is, already, intrinsic, to, it, the, iconoclast, policy, enforced, by, a, series, of, decrees, of, emperor, leo, iii, the, isaurian, in, 726, 729, was, resisted, in, the, west, giving, rise, to, friction, that, ended, in, 787, when, the, second, council, of, nicaea, reaffirmed, that, images, are, to, be, venerated, but, not, worshipped, the, libri, carolini, commissioned, by, charlemagne, criticized, what, a, faulty, translation, gave, as, the, council, s, decision, but, their, objections, were, rebutted, by, pope, adrian, i, from, the, catholic, church, s, perspective, the, ecclesiological, issues, are, central, which, is, why, they, characterize, the, split, between, the, two, churches, as, a, schism, in, their, view, the, eastern, orthodox, are, very, close, to, them, in, theology, and, the, catholic, church, does, not, consider, the, eastern, orthodox, beliefs, to, be, heretical, however, from, the, perspective, of, eastern, orthodox, theologians, there, are, theological, issues, that, run, much, deeper, than, just, the, theology, around, the, primacy, of, the, pope, in, fact, this, is, in, contrast, to, catholics, who, do, not, generally, consider, the, orthodox, heretical, and, speak, instead, about, the, eastern, schism, in, the, catholic, church, too, some, writers, may, be, found, who, speak, pejoratively, about, the, eastern, orthodox, church, and, its, theology, but, these, writers, are, marginal, the, official, view, of, the, catholic, church, is, the, one, expressed, in, the, decree, unitatis, redintegratio, of, vatican, ii, in, the, study, of, revelation, east, and, west, have, followed, different, methods, and, have, developed, differently, their, understanding, and, confession, of, god, s, truth, it, is, hardly, surprising, then, if, from, time, to, time, one, tradition, has, come, nearer, to, a, full, appreciation, of, some, aspects, of, a, mystery, of, revelation, than, the, other, or, has, expressed, it, to, better, advantage, in, such, cases, these, various, theological, expressions, are, to, be, considered, often, as, mutually, complementary, rather, than, conflicting, where, the, authentic, theological, traditions, of, the, eastern, church, are, concerned, we, must, recognize, the, admirable, way, in, which, they, have, their, roots, in, holy, scripture, and, how, they, are, nurtured, and, given, expression, in, the, life, of, the, liturgy, they, derive, their, strength, too, from, the, living, tradition, of, the, apostles, and, from, the, works, of, the, fathers, and, spiritual, writers, of, the, eastern, churches, thus, they, promote, the, right, ordering, of, christian, life, and, indeed, pave, the, way, to, a, full, vision, of, christian, truth, although, the, western, churches, do, not, consider, the, eastern, and, western, understanding, of, the, trinity, to, be, radically, different, eastern, theologians, such, as, john, romanides, and, michael, pomazansky, argue, that, the, filioque, clause, is, symptomatic, of, a, fatal, flaw, in, the, western, understanding, which, they, attribute, to, the, influence, of, augustine, and, by, extension, to, that, of, thomas, aquinas, filioque, latin, for, and, from, the, son, was, added, in, western, christianity, to, the, latin, text, of, the, nicene, constantinopolitan, creed, which, also, varies, from, the, original, greek, text, in, having, the, additional, phrase, deum, de, deo, god, from, god, and, in, using, the, singular, i, believe, latin, credo, greek, instead, of, the, original, we, believe, greek, which, oriental, orthodoxy, preserves, the, assyrian, church, of, the, east, which, is, in, communion, neither, with, the, eastern, orthodox, church, nor, with, oriental, orthodoxy, uses, we, believe, filioque, states, that, the, holy, spirit, proceeds, from, the, son, as, well, as, from, the, father, a, doctrine, accepted, by, the, catholic, church, by, anglicanism, and, by, protestant, churches, in, general, christians, of, these, groups, generally, include, it, when, reciting, the, nicene, creed, nonetheless, these, groups, recognize, that, filioque, is, not, part, of, the, original, text, established, at, the, first, council, of, constantinople, in, 381, and, they, do, not, demand, that, others, too, should, use, it, when, saying, the, creed, the, catholic, church, does, not, add, the, phrase, corresponding, to, filioque, to, the, greek, text, of, the, creed, including, in, the, roman, rite, of, latin, church, catholics, at, the, 879, 880, council, of, constantinople, the, eastern, orthodox, church, anathematized, the, filioque, phrase, as, a, novelty, and, augmentation, of, the, creed, and, in, their, 1848, encyclical, the, eastern, patriarchs, spoke, of, it, as, a, heresy, it, was, qualified, as, such, by, some, of, the, eastern, orthodox, church, s, saints, including, photios, i, of, constantinople, mark, of, ephesus, and, gregory, palamas, who, have, been, called, the, three, pillars, of, orthodoxy, the, eastern, church, believes, by, the, western, church, inserting, the, filioque, unilaterally, without, consulting, or, holding, council, with, the, east, into, the, creed, that, the, western, church, broke, communion, with, the, east, eastern, orthodox, theologians, such, as, vladimir, lossky, criticize, the, focus, of, western, theology, of, god, in, god, in, uncreated, essence, as, misguided, which, he, alleges, is, a, modalistic, and, therefore, a, speculative, expression, of, god, that, is, indicative, of, the, sabellian, heresy, eastern, orthodox, theologian, michael, pomazansky, argues, that, in, order, for, the, holy, spirit, to, proceed, from, the, father, and, the, son, in, the, creed, there, would, have, to, be, two, sources, in, the, deity, double, procession, whereas, in, the, one, god, there, can, only, be, one, source, of, divinity, which, is, the, father, hypostasis, of, the, trinity, not, god, s, essence, per, se, in, contrast, bishop, kallistos, ware, suggests, that, the, problem, is, more, in, the, area, of, semantics, than, of, basic, doctrinal, differences, the, filioque, controversy, which, has, separated, us, for, so, many, centuries, is, more, than, a, mere, technicality, but, it, is, not, insoluble, qualifying, the, firm, position, taken, when, i, wrote, the, orthodox, church, twenty, years, ago, i, now, believe, after, further, study, that, the, problem, is, more, in, the, area, of, semantics, than, in, any, basic, doctrinal, differences, lossky, argues, the, difference, in, east, and, west, is, because, of, the, catholic, church, s, use, of, pagan, metaphysical, philosophy, and, scholasticism, rather, than, actual, experience, of, god, called, theoria, to, validate, the, theological, dogmas, of, catholic, christianity, for, this, reason, lossky, states, that, eastern, orthodox, and, catholics, have, become, different, men, other, eastern, orthodox, theologians, such, as, romanides, and, metropolitan, hierotheos, of, nafpaktos, have, made, similar, pronouncements, according, to, the, orthodox, teachings, theoria, can, be, achieved, through, ascetic, practices, like, hesychasm, which, was, condemned, as, a, heresy, by, barlaam, of, seminara, eastern, orthodox, theologians, charge, that, in, contrast, to, eastern, orthodox, theology, western, theology, is, based, on, philosophical, discourse, which, reduces, humanity, and, nature, to, cold, mechanical, concepts, roman, catholicism, rationalizes, even, the, sacrament, of, the, eucharist, it, interprets, spiritual, action, as, purely, material, and, debases, the, sacrament, to, such, an, extent, that, it, becomes, in, its, view, a, kind, of, atomistic, miracle, the, orthodox, church, has, no, metaphysical, theory, of, transsubstantiation, and, there, is, no, need, of, such, a, theory, christ, is, the, lord, of, the, elements, and, it, is, in, his, power, to, do, so, that, every, thing, without, in, the, least, changing, its, physical, substance, could, become, his, body, christ, s, body, in, the, eucharist, is, not, physical, flesh, eastern, orthodox, theologians, argue, that, the, mind, reason, rationality, is, the, focus, of, western, theology, whereas, in, eastern, theology, the, mind, must, be, put, in, the, heart, so, they, are, united, into, what, is, called, nous, this, unity, as, heart, is, the, focus, of, eastern, orthodox, christianity, involving, the, unceasing, prayer, of, the, heart, in, orthodox, theology, in, the, eastern, ascetic, traditions, one, of, the, goals, of, ascetic, practice, is, to, obtain, sobriety, of, consciousness, awakeness, nepsis, for, humankind, this, is, reached, via, the, healing, of, the, whole, person, encompassing, the, soul, heart, when, a, person, s, heart, is, reconciled, with, their, mind, this, is, referred, to, as, a, healing, of, the, nous, or, the, eye, focus, of, the, heart, or, soul, part, of, this, process, is, the, healing, and, reconciliation, of, humankind, s, reason, logos, or, dianoia, with, the, heart, or, soul, while, the, human, spirit, and, body, are, energies, vivified, by, the, soul, orthodoxy, teaches, sin, suffering, and, sorrow, are, caused, by, the, heart, and, mind, being, in, conflict, according, to, orthodox, theology, a, lack, of, noetic, understanding, sickness, can, be, neither, circumvented, nor, satisfied, by, rational, or, discursive, thought, i, e, systematization, denying, the, needs, of, the, human, heart, the, needs, of, the, soul, is, seen, to, cause, various, negative, or, destructive, manifestations, such, as, addiction, atheism, and, evil, thoughts, etc, a, cleaned, healed, or, restored, nous, creates, the, condition, of, sobriety, or, nepsis, of, the, mind, orthodox, theologians, assert, that, the, theological, division, of, east, and, west, culminated, into, a, direct, theological, conflict, known, as, the, hesychasm, controversy, during, several, councils, at, constantinople, between, 1341, and, 1351, they, argue, that, this, controversy, highlighted, the, sharp, contrast, between, what, is, embraced, by, the, catholic, church, as, proper, or, orthodox, theological, dogma, and, how, theology, is, validated, by, the, eastern, orthodox, the, essence, of, the, disagreement, is, that, in, the, east, a, person, cannot, be, a, true, theologian, or, teach, the, knowledge, of, god, without, having, experienced, god, as, defined, as, the, vision, of, god, theoria, at, the, heart, of, the, issue, was, the, teaching, of, the, essence, energies, distinctions, which, states, that, while, creation, can, never, know, god, s, uncreated, essence, it, can, know, his, uncreated, energies, by, gregory, palamas, some, eastern, orthodox, polemicists, claim, that, eastern, orthodox, do, not, accept, augustine, s, teaching, of, original, sin, his, interpretation, of, ancestral, sin, is, rejected, in, the, east, as, well, nor, is, augustine, s, teaching, accepted, in, its, totality, in, the, west, the, catholic, church, rejects, traducianism, and, affirms, creationism, of, the, soul, its, teaching, on, original, sin, is, largely, based, on, but, not, identical, with, that, of, augustine, and, is, opposed, to, the, interpretation, of, augustine, advanced, by, martin, luther, and, john, calvin, its, teaching, departs, from, augustine, s, ideas, in, some, respects, another, eastern, orthodox, view, is, expressed, by, christos, yannaras, who, described, augustine, as, the, fount, of, every, distortion, and, alteration, in, the, church, s, truth, in, the, west, this, view, is, ahistorical, in, fact, augustine, s, teaching, on, original, sin, was, solemnly, affirmed, by, the, ecumenical, council, of, ephesus, and, the, ecumenical, second, council, of, constantinople, numbered, saint, augustine, among, the, great, doctors, of, the, church, alongside, athanasius, of, alexandria, hilary, of, poitiers, basil, of, caesarea, gregory, of, nazianzus, gregory, of, nyssa, st, ambrose, theophilus, john, chrysostom, cyril, of, alexandria, and, pope, leo, the, great, the, late, modern, denial, by, some, eastern, orthodox, writers, of, the, supposedly, western, teaching, on, original, sin, is, regarded, by, some, traditionalist, eastern, orthodox, as, a, form, of, modernism, what, the, eastern, orthodox, church, accepts, is, that, ancestral, sin, corrupted, their, existence, their, bodies, and, environment, that, each, person, is, born, into, and, thus, we, are, born, into, a, corrupted, existence, by, the, ancestral, sin, of, adam, and, eve, and, that, original, sin, is, hereditary, it, did, not, remain, only, adam, and, eve, s, as, life, passes, from, them, to, all, of, their, descendants, so, does, original, sin, all, of, us, participate, in, original, sin, because, we, are, all, descended, from, the, same, forefather, adam, the, teaching, of, the, eastern, orthodox, church, is, that, as, a, result, of, adam, s, sin, hereditary, sin, flowed, to, his, posterity, so, that, everyone, who, is, born, after, the, flesh, bears, this, burden, and, experiences, the, fruits, of, it, in, this, present, world, similarly, what, the, catholic, church, holds, is, that, the, sin, of, adam, that, we, inherit, and, for, the, remission, of, which, even, babies, who, have, no, personal, sin, are, baptized, is, called, sin, only, in, an, analogical, sense, since, it, is, not, an, act, committed, like, the, personal, sin, of, adam, and, eve, but, a, fallen, state, contracted, by, the, transmission, of, a, human, nature, deprived, of, original, holiness, and, justice, both, east, and, west, hold, that, each, person, is, not, called, to, atone, for, the, actual, sin, committed, by, adam, and, eve, according, to, the, western, church, original, sin, does, not, have, the, character, of, a, personal, fault, in, any, of, adam, s, descendants, and, the, eastern, church, teaches, that, by, these, fruits, and, this, burden, we, do, not, understand, sin, the, orthodox, and, the, catholics, believe, that, people, inherit, only, the, spiritual, sickness, in, which, all, suffer, and, sin, of, adam, and, eve, caused, by, their, ancestral, sin, what, has, flowed, to, them, a, sickness, leaving, them, weakened, in, their, powers, subject, to, ignorance, suffering, from, the, domination, of, death, and, inclined, to, sin, the, catholic, doctrine, of, the, immaculate, conception, which, claims, that, god, protected, the, virgin, mary, from, original, sin, through, no, merit, of, her, own, was, dogmatically, defined, by, pope, pius, ix, in, 1854, orthodox, theology, proclaims, that, mary, was, chosen, to, bear, christ, having, first, found, favor, of, god, by, her, purity, and, obedience, another, point, of, theological, contention, between, the, western, and, eastern, churches, is, the, doctrine, of, purgatory, as, it, was, shown, at, the, second, council, of, lyon, and, the, council, of, ferrara, florence, it, was, developed, in, time, in, western, theology, according, to, which, all, who, die, in, god, s, grace, and, friendship, but, still, imperfectly, purified, are, indeed, assured, of, their, eternal, salvation, but, after, death, they, undergo, purification, so, as, to, achieve, the, holiness, necessary, to, enter, the, joy, of, heaven, however, some, eastern, theologians, while, agreeing, that, there, is, beyond, death, a, state, in, which, believers, continue, to, be, perfected, and, led, to, full, divinization, consider, that, it, is, a, state, not, of, punishment, but, of, growth, they, hold, that, suffering, cannot, purify, sin, since, they, have, a, different, view, of, sin, and, consider, suffering, as, a, result, of, a, spiritual, sickness, western, theology, usually, considers, sin, not, only, as, a, sickness, that, weakens, and, impedes, but, also, as, something, that, merits, punishment, the, eastern, orthodox, church, holds, that, there, is, a, state, beyond, death, where, believers, continue, to, be, perfected, and, led, to, full, divinization, although, some, orthodox, have, described, this, intermediate, state, as, purgatory, others, distinguish, it, from, aspects, associated, with, it, in, the, west, at, the, council, of, ferrara, florence, the, orthodox, bishop, mark, of, ephesus, argued, that, there, are, in, it, no, purifying, fires, some, orthodox, christians, also, subscribe, to, the, belief, of, aerial, toll, houses, which, states, that, souls, are, tested, by, demons, while, on, their, way, to, heaven, this, concept, is, not, found, in, roman, catholicism, the, traditional, orthodox, teaching, is, that, those, who, reject, christ, will, suffer, his, absence, according, to, the, confession, of, dositheus, persons, go, immediately, to, joy, in, christ, or, to, the, torments, of, punishment, in, orthodox, doctrine, there, is, no, place, without, god, in, eternity, there, is, no, hiding, from, god, in, catholic, theology, god, is, present, everywhere, not, only, by, his, power, but, in, himself, hell, is, a, state, of, self, selected, separation, from, god, eastern, theology, considers, the, desire, to, sin, to, be, the, result, of, a, spiritual, sickness, caused, by, adam, and, eve, s, pride, which, needs, to, be, cured, one, such, theologian, gives, his, interpretation, of, western, theology, as, follows, according, to, the, holy, fathers, of, the, church, there, is, not, an, uncreated, paradise, and, a, created, hell, as, the, franco, latin, tradition, teaches, the, eastern, church, believes, that, hell, and, heaven, exist, with, reference, to, being, with, god, and, that, the, very, same, divine, love, god, s, uncreated, energies, which, is, a, source, of, bliss, and, consolation, for, the, righteous, because, they, love, god, his, love, is, heaven, for, them, is, also, a, source, of, torment, or, a, lake, of, fire, for, sinners, the, western, church, speaks, of, heaven, and, hell, as, states, of, existence, rather, than, as, places, while, in, eastern, orthodoxy, there, is, no, hell, per, se, there, is, a, hell, in, the, absence, of, god, s, grace, to, quote, st, john, of, damascus, god, does, not, punish, but, each, one, decides, on, his, receiving, of, god, whose, reception, is, joy, and, his, absence, a, hell, gr, the, byzantine, empire, was, a, theocracy, the, emperor, was, the, supreme, authority, in, both, church, and, state, the, king, is, not, god, among, men, but, the, viceroy, of, god, he, is, not, the, logos, incarnate, but, is, in, a, special, relation, with, the, logos, he, has, been,

strength, in, its, conformity, with, the, monarchy, of, god, in, the, east, endorsement, of, caesaropapism, the, subordination, of, the, church, to, the, religious, claims, of, the, dominant, political, order, was, most, fully, evident, in, the, byzantine, empire, at, the, end, of, the, first, millennium, while, in, the, west, where, the, decline, of, imperial, authority, left, the, church, relatively, independent, there, was, the, growth, of, the, power, of, the, papacy, as, a, result, of, the, muslim, conquests, of, the, territories, of, the, patriarchates, of, alexandria, antioch, and, jerusalem, only, two, rival, powerful, centres, of, ecclesiastical, authority, constantinople, and, rome, remained, until, this, happened, rome, often, tried, to, act, as, a, neutral, mediator, in, disputes, among, the, eastern, patriarchies, in, eastern, christendom, the, teaching, of, papal, supremacy, is, said, to, be, based, on, the, pseudo, isidorian, decretals, documents, attributed, to, early, popes, but, actually, forged, probably, in, the, second, quarter, of, the, 9th, century, with, the, aim, of, defending, the, position, of, bishops, against, metropolitans, and, secular, authorities, the, orthodox, east, contests, the, teaching, that, peter, was, the, patriarch, of, rome, a, title, that, the, west, too, does, not, give, him, early, sources, such, as, st, irenaeus, can, be, interpreted, as, describing, pope, linus, as, the, first, bishop, of, rome, and, pope, cletus, the, second, the, oxford, dictionary, of, popes, states, in, the, late, 2nd, or, early, 3rd, cent, the, tradition, identified, peter, as, the, first, bishop, of, rome, this, was, a, natural, development, once, the, monarchical, episcopate, i, e, the, government, of, the, local, church, by, a, single, bishop, as, distinct, from, a, group, of, presbyter, bishops, finally, emerged, in, rome, in, the, mid, 2nd, cent, the, earlier, tradition, however, which, placed, peter, and, paul, in, a, class, apart, as, the, pioneers, who, together, established, the, roman, church, and, its, ministry, was, never, lost, sight, of, st, peter, was, according, to, tradition, bishop, of, antioch, at, one, point, and, was, then, succeeded, by, evodius, and, ignatius, the, eastern, orthodox, do, not, hold, the, primacy, of, the, pope, of, rome, over, the, eastern, church, they, teach, that, the, pope, of, rome, is, the, first, among, equals, the, first, seven, ecumenical, councils, were, held, in, the, east, and, called, by, the, eastern, emperors, roman, pontiffs, never, presided, over, any, of, them, the, schism, between, the, western, and, eastern, mediterranean, christians, resulted, from, a, variety, of, political, cultural, and, theological, factors, which, transpired, over, centuries, historians, regard, the, mutual, excommunications, of, 1054, as, the, terminal, event, it, is, difficult, to, agree, on, a, date, for, the, event, where, the, start, of, the, schism, was, apparent, it, may, have, started, as, early, as, the, quartodeciman, controversy, at, the, time, of, victor, of, rome, c, 180, orthodox, apologists, point, to, this, incident, as, an, example, of, claims, by, rome, to, the, papal, primacy, and, its, rejection, by, eastern, churches, sporadic, schisms, in, the, common, unions, took, place, under, pope, damasus, i, in, the, 4th, and, 5th, centuries, disputes, about, theological, and, other, questions, led, to, schisms, between, the, churches, in, rome, and, constantinople, for, 37, years, from, 482, to, 519, the, acacian, schism, most, sources, agree, that, the, separation, between, east, and, west, is, clearly, evident, by, the, photian, schism, in, 863, to, 867, while, the, church, at, rome, claimed, a, special, authority, over, the, other, churches, the, extant, documents, of, that, era, yield, no, clear, cut, claims, to, or, recognition, of, papal, primacy, towards, the, end, of, the, 2nd, century, victor, the, bishop, of, rome, attempted, to, resolve, the, quartodeciman, controversy, the, question, was, whether, to, celebrate, easter, concurrently, with, the, jewish, passover, as, christians, in, the, roman, province, of, asia, did, or, to, wait, until, the, following, sunday, as, was, decreed, by, synods, held, in, other, eastern, provinces, such, as, those, of, palestine, and, pontus, the, acts, of, which, were, still, extant, at, the, time, of, eusebius, and, in, rome, the, pope, attempted, to, excommunicate, the, churches, in, asia, which, refused, to, accept, the, observance, on, sunday, other, bishops, rebuked, him, for, doing, so, laurent, cleenewerck, comments, victor, obviously, claimed, superior, authority, probably, from, st, peter, and, decided, or, at, least, attempted, to, excommunicate, a, whole, group, of, churches, because, they, followed, a, different, tradition, and, refused, to, conform, one, could, therefore, argue, that, the, great, schism, started, with, victor, continued, with, stephen, and, remained, underground, until, the, ninth, century, but, the, question, is, this, even, if, victor, was, not, acting, wisely, did, he, not, have, the, power, to, cut, off, whole, churches, this, is, what, roman, catholics, argue, with, the, implication, that, such, an, excommunication, would, be, ontologically, meaningful, and, put, someone, outside, the, catholic, church, yet, we, do, not, see, bishops, pleading, but, indeed, sharply, rebuking, and, admonishing, victor, ultimately, this, is, why, his, letters, of, excommunication, came, to, no, effect, nevertheless, it, is, possible, to, read, in, eusebius, account, the, possibility, that, st, irenaeus, recognized, that, victor, could, indeed, cut, off, whole, churches, and, that, such, excommunication, would, have, been, ontologically, meaningful, in, the, end, it, took, some, patience, and, an, ecumenical, council, to, achieve, what, victor, could, not, achieve, by, his, threat, to, excommunicate, despite, victor, s, failure, to, carry, out, his, intent, to, excommunicate, the, asian, churches, many, catholic, apologists, point, to, this, episode, as, evidence, of, papal, primacy, and, authority, in, the, early, church, citing, the, fact, that, none, of, the, bishops, challenged, his, right, to, excommunicate, but, instead, questioned, the, wisdom, and, charity, of, his, action, anglican, apologists, question, the, premise, that, victor, even, asserted, what, he, imagined, to, be, supremacy, victor, s, action, is, inexplicable, on, the, hypothesis, that, the, papal, monarchy, is, jure, divino, if, that, were, so, he, must, have, adopted, in, discharge, of, his, duty, as, supreme, shepherd, a, very, different, course, he, the, supreme, judge, having, supreme, jurisdiction, which, is, immediate, ordinary, and, truly, episcopal, over, the, asiatic, churches, would, have, commanded, them, by, his, real, and, sovereign, authority, which, the, whole, community, is, bound, to, obey, which, could, receive, no, increase, of, authority, from, synods, to, conform, their, usage, to, his, judgment, which, could, not, be, reviewed, a, man, too, of, his, temperament, would, certainly, not, fail, to, use, to, the, uttermost, whatever, authority, he, possessed, his, action, shows, that, however, harshly, he, may, in, his, intolerance, have, pressed, the, matter, he, evidently, had, no, idea, that, any, such, sovereign, power, was, possessed, by, him, the, opinion, of, the, bishop, of, rome, was, often, sought, especially, when, the, patriarchs, of, the, eastern, mediterranean, were, locked, in, fractious, dispute, however, the, bishop, of, rome, s, opinion, was, by, no, means, accepted, automatically, the, bishops, of, rome, never, obviously, belonged, to, either, the, antiochian, or, the, alexandrian, schools, of, theology, and, usually, managed, to, steer, a, middle, course, between, whatever, extremes, were, being, propounded, by, theologians, of, either, school, because, rome, was, remote, from, the, centers, of, christianity, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, it, was, frequently, hoped, its, bishop, would, be, more, impartial, for, instance, in, 431, cyril, the, patriarch, of, alexandria, appealed, to, pope, celestine, i, as, well, as, the, other, patriarchs, charging, constantinople, patriarch, nestorius, with, heresy, which, was, dealt, with, at, the, council, of, ephesus, he, nevertheless, believed, rome, s, capacity, to, excommunicate, nestorius, to, only, be, effective, in, the, west, in, 342, pope, julius, i, wrote, the, custom, has, been, for, word, to, be, written, first, to, us, and, then, for, a, just, sentence, to, be, passed, from, this, place, this, was, also, decreed, by, the, council, of, sardica, which, declared, saint, athanasius, to, be, the, lawful, bishop, of, alexandria, in, 382, a, synod, in, rome, protested, against, the, raising, of, constantinople, to, a, position, above, that, of, alexandria, and, spoke, of, rome, as, the, apostolic, see, pope, siricius, 384, 399, claimed, for, papal, decretals, the, same, binding, force, as, decisions, of, synods, pope, innocent, i, 401, 417, said, that, all, major, judicial, cases, should, be, reserved, for, the, see, of, rome, and, pope, boniface, i, 418, 422, declared, that, the, church, of, rome, stands, to, the, churches, throughout, the, world, as, the, head, to, its, members, and, that, bishops, everywhere, while, holding, the, one, same, episcopal, office, must, recognise, those, to, whom, for, the, sake, of, ecclesiastical, discipline, they, should, be, subject, celestine, i, r, 422, 432, considered, that, the, condemnation, of, nestorius, by, his, own, roman, synod, in, 430, was, sufficient, but, consented, to, the, general, council, as, of, benefit, in, manifesting, the, faith, pope, leo, i, and, his, successors, rejected, canon, 28, of, the, council, of, chalcedon, as, a, result, of, which, it, was, not, officially, recorded, even, in, the, east, until, the, 6th, century, the, acacian, schism, when, for, the, first, time, west, lines, up, against, east, in, a, clear, cut, fashion, ended, with, acceptance, of, a, declaration, insisted, on, by, pope, hormisdas, 514, 523, that, i, hope, i, shall, remain, in, communion, with, the, apostolic, see, in, which, is, found, the, whole, true, and, perfect, stability, of, the, christian, religion, yet, the, vast, majority, of, the, eastern, bishops, subscribed, quite, a, different, formula, earlier, in, 494, pope, gelasius, i, 492, 496, wrote, to, byzantine, emperor, anastasius, distinguishing, the, power, of, civil, rulers, from, that, of, the, bishops, called, priests, in, the, document, with, the, latter, supreme, in, religious, matters, he, ended, his, letter, with, and, if, it, is, fitting, that, the, hearts, of, the, faithful, should, submit, to, all, priests, in, general, who, properly, administer, divine, affairs, how, much, the, more, is, obedience, due, to, the, bishop, of, that, see, which, the, most, high, ordained, to, be, above, all, others, and, which, is, consequently, dutifully, honoured, by, the, devotion, of, the, whole, church, pope, nicholas, i, 858, 867, made, it, clear, that, he, believed, the, power, of, the, papacy, extended, over, all, the, earth, that, is, over, every, church, in, 330, emperor, constantine, moved, the, imperial, capital, to, byzantium, which, later, became, constantinople, the, centre, of, gravity, in, the, empire, was, fully, recognised, to, have, completely, shifted, to, the, eastern, mediterranean, rome, lost, the, senate, to, constantinople, and, lost, its, status, and, gravitas, as, imperial, capital, the, bishop, of, byzantium, was, under, the, authority, of, the, metropolitan, of, heraclea, when, constantine, moved, there, thereafter, the, bishop, s, connection, with, the, imperial, court, meant, that, he, was, able, to, free, himself, from, ecclesiastical, dependency, on, heraclea, and, in, little, more, than, half, a, century, to, obtain, recognition, of, next, after, rome, ranking, from, the, first, council, of, constantinople, 381, held, in, the, new, capital, it, decreed, the, bishop, of, constantinople, however, shall, have, the, prerogative, of, honour, after, the, bishop, of, rome, because, constantinople, is, new, rome, thus, raising, it, above, the, sees, of, alexandria, and, antioch, this, has, been, described, as, sowing, the, seed, for, the, ecclesiastical, rivalry, between, constantinople, and, rome, that, was, a, factor, leading, to, the, schism, between, east, and, west, the, website, of, the, orthodox, church, in, america, says, that, the, bishop, of, byzantium, was, elevated, to, patriarch, already, in, the, time, of, constantine, disunion, in, the, roman, empire, contributed, to, disunion, in, the, church, theodosius, the, great, who, in, 380, established, nicene, christianity, as, the, official, religion, of, the, roman, empire, see, edict, of, thessalonica, was, the, last, emperor, to, rule, over, a, united, roman, empire, following, the, death, of, theodosius, in, 395, the, empire, was, divided, for, the, final, time, into, western, and, eastern, halves, in, the, 4th, century, the, roman, emperor, reigning, in, constantinople, started, to, control, the, church, in, his, territory, the, patriarchs, of, constantinople, often, tried, to, adopt, a, commanding, position, over, the, other, patriarchs, provoking, their, resistance, for, example, in, 431, patriarch, cyril, of, alexandria, impeached, for, heresy, patriarch, nestorius, of, constantinople, alexandria, s, objections, to, constantinople, s, promotion, which, led, to, a, constant, struggle, between, the, two, sees, in, the, first, half, of, the, 5th, century, were, supported, by, rome, which, proposed, the, theory, that, the, most, important, sees, were, the, three, petrine, ones, of, rome, antioch, and, alexandria, with, rome, in, the, first, place, however, the, power, of, the, patriarch, of, constantinople, continued, to, grow, eastern, orthodox, state, that, the, 28th, canon, of, the, council, of, chalcedon, 451, explicitly, proclaimed, the, equality, of, the, bishops, of, rome, and, constantinople, and, that, it, established, the, highest, court, of, ecclesiastical, appeal, in, constantinople, the, patriarch, of, the, imperial, capital, succeeded, in, his, efforts, to, become, the, leading, bishop, in, the, byzantine, empire, he, headed, a, vast, curia, and, other, bishops, who, resided, in, constantinople, constituted, a, permanent, synod, which, became, the, real, governing, body, of, the, church, patriarch, john, iv, of, constantinople, who, died, in, 595, assumed, the, title, of, ecumenical, patriarch, the, idea, that, with, the, transfer, of, the, imperial, capital, from, rome, to, constantinople, primacy, in, the, church, was, also, transferred, is, found, in, undeveloped, form, as, early, as, john, philoponus, c, 490, c, 570, it, was, enunciated, in, its, most, advanced, form, by, photios, i, of, constantinople, c, 810, c, 893, constantinople, as, the, seat, of, the, ruler, of, the, empire, and, therefore, of, the, world, was, the, highest, among, the, patriarchates, and, like, the, emperor, had, the, right, to, govern, them, after, the, roman, emperor, constantine, the, great, legalized, christianity, with, the, edict, of, milan, he, summoned, the, first, ecumenical, council, at, nicaea, in, 325, the, bishops, at, the, council, confirmed, the, position, of, the, metropolitan, sees, of, rome, and, alexandria, as, having, authority, outside, their, own, province, and, also, the, existing, privileges, of, the, churches, in, antioch, and, the, other, provinces, these, sees, were, later, called, patriarchates, these, were, given, an, order, of, precedence, rome, as, the, capital, of, the, empire, was, naturally, given, first, place, then, came, alexandria, and, antioch, in, a, separate, canon, the, council, also, approved, the, special, honor, given, to, jerusalem, over, other, sees, subject, to, the, same, metropolitan, roman, dominate, emperor, theodosius, i, convened, the, second, ecumenical, council, constantinople, i, at, the, imperial, capital, city, in, 381, the, council, elevated, the, see, of, constantinople, to, a, position, ahead, of, the, other, chief, metropolitan, sees, except, that, of, rome, thus, raising, it, above, the, sees, of, alexandria, and, antioch, this, action, has, been, described, as, sowing, the, seed, for, the, ecclesiastical, rivalry, between, constantinople, and, rome, which, was, ultimately, a, factor, leading, to, the, schism, between, east, and, west, it, demarcated, the, territory, within, the, praetorian, prefecture, of, the, east, into, five, canonical, territories, corresponding, to, the, five, civil, dioceses, diocese, of, egypt, metropolis, in, alexandria, diocese, of, the, east,

affairs, of, that, province, alone, except, for, the, privileges, already, recognized, for, the, sees, of, alexandria, and, antioch, generally, no, western, bishops, attended, the, council, though, ascholius, of, thessalonica, a, city, under, roman, jurisdiction, at, that, time, did, attend, and, was, tasked, by, pope, damasus, to, insure, that, an, utterly, blameless, bishop, be, elected, for, constantinople, the, latin, church, appears, to, have, initially, accepted, the, canons, of, this, council, as, evidenced, to, one, of, them, being, cited, by, a, roman, legate, during, the, council, of, chalcedon, and, all, extant, sources, include, these, canons, rome, s, tome, of, leo, 449, was, highly, regarded, and, formed, the, basis, for, the, council, of, chalcedon, formulation, but, it, was, not, universally, accepted, and, was, even, called, impious, and, blasphemous, by, those, who, condemned, the, council, that, approved, and, accepted, it, the, next, ecumenical, council, corrected, a, possible, imbalance, in, pope, leo, s, presentation, although, the, bishop, of, rome, was, well, respected, even, at, this, early, date, the, east, holds, that, the, concept, of, the, primacy, of, the, roman, see, and, papal, infallibility, were, only, developed, much, later, the, disputed, canon, 28, of, the, council, of, chalcedon, in, 451, confirming, the, authority, already, held, by, constantinople, granted, its, archbishop, jurisdiction, over, pontus, and, thrace, the, council, also, ratified, an, agreement, between, antioch, and, jerusalem, whereby, jerusalem, held, jurisdiction, over, three, provinces, numbering, it, among, the, five, great, sees, as, thus, interpreted, there, were, now, five, patriarchs, presiding, over, the, church, within, the, byzantine, empire, in, the, following, order, of, precedence, the, patriarch, of, rome, the, patriarch, of, constantinople, the, patriarch, of, alexandria, the, patriarch, of, antioch, and, the, patriarch, of, jerusalem, although, leo, i, whose, delegates, were, absent, when, this, resolution, was, passed, recognized, the, council, as, ecumenical, and, confirmed, its, doctrinal, decrees, he, rejected, its, canon, 28, on, the, ground, that, it, contravened, the, sixth, canon, of, nicaea, and, infringed, the, rights, of, alexandria, and, antioch, this, canon, would, remain, a, constant, source, of, friction, between, east, and, west, until, the, mutual, excommunications, of, 1054, made, it, irrelevant, in, that, regard, but, controversy, about, its, applicability, to, the, authority, of, the, patriarchate, of, constantinople, still, continues, the, same, disputed, canon, also, recognized, the, authority, of, constantinople, over, bishops, of, dioceses, among, the, barbarians, which, has, been, variously, interpreted, as, referring, either, to, all, areas, outside, the, byzantine, empire, or, only, to, those, in, the, vicinity, of, pontus, asia, and, thrace, or, to, non, greeks, within, the, empire, canon, 9, of, the, council, also, declared, if, a, bishop, or, clergyman, should, have, a, difference, with, the, metropolitan, of, the, province, let, him, have, recourse, to, the, exarch, of, the, diocese, or, to, the, throne, of, the, imperial, city, of, constantinople, and, there, let, it, be, tried, this, has, been, interpreted, as, conferring, on, the, see, of, constantinople, a, greater, privilege, than, what, any, council, ever, gave, rome, or, as, of, much, lesser, significance, than, that, in, 476, when, the, last, emperor, of, the, western, part, of, the, roman, empire, was, deposed, and, the, western, imperial, insignia, were, sent, to, constantinople, there, was, once, again, a, single, roman, emperor, however, he, had, little, power, in, the, west, which, was, ruled, almost, entirely, by, various, germanic, tribes, in, the, opinion, of, randall, r, cloud, the, permanent, separation, of, the, greek, east, from, the, latin, west, was, the, fundamental, reason, for, the, estrangement, that, soon, followed, between, the, greek, and, the, latin, christians, the, dominant, language, of, the, west, was, latin, while, that, of, the, east, was, greek, soon, after, the, fall, of, the, west, to, invaders, the, number, of, individuals, who, spoke, both, languages, dwindled, and, communication, between, east, and, west, grew, much, more, difficult, with, linguistic, unity, gone, cultural, unity, began, to, crumble, as, well, the, two, halves, of, the, church, were, naturally, divided, along, similar, lines, they, developed, different, rites, and, had, different, approaches, to, religious, doctrines, although, the, schism, was, still, centuries, away, its, outlines, were, already, perceptible, in, the, areas, under, his, control, justinian, i, established, caesaropapism, as, the, constitution, of, the, church, in, a, scheme, according, to, which, the, emperor, had, the, right, and, duty, of, regulating, by, his, laws, the, minutest, detail, of, worship, and, discipline, and, also, of, dictating, the, theological, opinions, to, be, held, in, the, church, according, to, the, westminster, dictionary, of, theological, terms, this, caesaropapism, was, a, source, of, contention, between, rome, and, constantinople, that, led, to, the, schism, of, 1054, explicit, approval, of, the, emperor, in, constantinople, was, required, for, consecration, of, bishops, within, the, empire, during, the, period, called, the, byzantine, papacy, this, applied, to, the, bishops, of, rome, most, of, whom, were, of, greek, or, syrian, origin, resentment, in, the, west, against, the, byzantine, emperor, s, governance, of, the, church, is, shown, as, far, back, as, the, 6th, century, when, the, tolerance, of, the, arian, gothic, king, was, preferred, to, the, caesaropapist, claims, of, constantinople, the, origins, of, the, distinct, attitudes, in, west, and, east, are, sometimes, traced, back, even, to, augustine, of, hippo, who, saw, the, relationship, between, church, and, state, as, one, of, tension, between, the, city, of, god, and, the, city, of, the, world, and, eusebius, who, saw, the, state, as, the, protector, of, the, church, and, the, emperor, as, god, s, vicar, on, earth, by, 661, muslim, arabs, had, taken, over, the, territories, assigned, to, the, patriarchates, of, alexandria, antioch, and, jerusalem, which, thereafter, were, never, more, than, partially, and, temporarily, recovered, in, 732, emperor, leo, iii, the, isaurian, in, revenge, for, the, opposition, of, pope, gregory, iii, to, the, emperor, s, iconoclast, policies, transferred, sicily, calabria, and, illyria, from, the, patriarchate, of, rome, whose, jurisdiction, until, then, extended, as, far, east, as, thessalonica, to, that, of, constantinople, the, constantinople, patriarchate, after, expanding, eastward, at, the, time, of, the, council, of, chalcedon, to, take, in, pontus, and, the, roman, province, of, asia, which, at, that, time, were, still, under, the, emperor, s, control, thus, expanded, equally, to, the, west, and, was, practically, coextensive, with, the, byzantine, empire, the, west, s, rejection, of, the, quinisext, council, of, 692, led, to, pressure, from, the, eastern, empire, on, the, west, to, reject, many, latin, customs, as, non, orthodox, the, latin, practices, that, had, got, the, attention, of, the, other, patriarchates, and, that, had, been, condemned, by, this, council, included, the, practice, of, celebrating, mass, on, weekdays, in, lent, rather, than, having, pre, sanctified, liturgies, fasting, on, saturdays, throughout, the, year, omitting, the, alleluia, in, lent, depicting, christ, as, a, lamb, using, unleavened, bread, larger, disputes, were, revealed, regarding, eastern, and, western, attitudes, toward, celibacy, for, priests, and, deacons, with, the, council, affirming, the, right, of, married, men, to, become, priests, though, forbidding, priests, to, marry, and, forbidding, bishops, to, live, with, their, wives, and, prescribing, deposition, for, anyone, who, attempted, to, separate, a, clergyman, other, than, a, bishop, from, his, wife, or, for, any, cleric, other, than, a, bishop, who, dismissed, his, wife, pope, sergius, i, who, was, of, syrian, ancestry, rejected, the, council, emperor, justinian, ii, ordered, his, arrest, but, this, was, thwarted, in, 694, in, visigothic, spain, the, council, was, ratified, by, the, eighteenth, council, of, toledo, at, the, urging, of, the, king, wittiza, fruela, i, of, asturias, reversed, the, decision, of, toledo, sometime, during, his, reign, 757, 768, the, primary, causes, of, the, schism, were, disputes, over, conflicting, claims, of, jurisdiction, in, particular, over, papal, authority, pope, leo, ix, claimed, he, held, authority, over, the, four, eastern, patriarchs, and, over, the, insertion, of, the, filioque, clause, into, the, nicene, creed, by, the, western, patriarch, in, 1014, eastern, orthodox, today, state, that, council, of, chalcedon, canon, 28, explicitly, proclaimed, the, equality, of, the, bishops, of, rome, and, constantinople, and, that, it, established, the, highest, court, of, ecclesiastical, appeal, in, constantinople, council, of, ephesus, canon, 7, declared, it, is, unlawful, for, any, man, to, bring, forward, or, to, write, or, to, compose, a, different, faith, as, a, rival, to, that, established, by, the, holy, fathers, assembled, with, the, holy, ghost, in, nic, a, but, those, who, shall, dare, to, compose, a, different, faith, or, to, introduce, or, offer, it, to, persons, desiring, to, turn, to, the, acknowledgment, of, the, truth, whether, from, heathenism, or, from, judaism, or, from, any, heresy, whatsoever, shall, be, deposed, if, they, be, bishops, or, clergymen, bishops, from, the, episcopate, and, clergymen, from, the, clergy, and, if, they, be, laymen, they, shall, be, anathematized, eastern, orthodox, today, state, that, this, canon, of, the, council, of, ephesus, explicitly, prohibited, modification, of, the, nicene, creed, drawn, up, by, the, first, ecumenical, council, in, 325, the, wording, of, which, it, is, claimed, but, not, the, substance, had, been, modified, by, the, second, ecumenical, council, making, additions, such, as, who, proceeds, from, the, father, eastern, orthodox, argue, that, the, first, council, of, ephesus, canon, 7, explicitly, prohibited, modification, of, the, nicene, creed, by, any, man, not, by, ecumenical, church, council, drawn, up, by, the, first, ecumenical, council, in, 325, in, reality, the, council, made, no, exception, for, an, ecumenical, council, or, any, other, body, of, bishops, and, the, greeks, participating, in, the, council, of, florence, emphatically, denied, that, even, an, ecumenical, council, had, the, power, to, add, anything, to, the, creed, the, creed, quoted, in, the, acts, of, the, council, of, ephesus, of, 431, the, third, ecumenical, council, is, that, of, the, first, ecumenical, council, without, the, modifications, that, the, second, ecumenical, council, held, in, constantinople, in, 381, is, understood, to, have, made, to, it, such, as, the, addition, of, who, proceeds, from, the, father, eastern, orthodox, theologians, state, this, change, of, the, wording, of, the, churches, original, creed, was, done, to, address, various, teachings, outside, of, the, church, specifically, that, of, macedonius, i, of, constantinople, which, the, council, claimed, was, a, distortion, of, the, church, s, teaching, on, the, holy, spirit, this, was, not, a, change, of, the, orthodoxy, of, the, churches, original, creed, thus, the, word, in, the, seventh, canon, of, the, later, council, of, ephesus, is, understood, as, meaning, different, or, contradictory, and, not, another, in, the, sense, of, mere, explanatory, additions, to, the, already, existing, creed, some, scholars, hold, that, the, additions, attributed, to, the, first, council, of, constantinople, were, adopted, only, with, the, 451, council, of, chalcedon, 20, years, after, that, of, ephesus, and, even, that, the, council, of, ephesus, in, which, alexandrian, influence, was, dominant, was, by, this, canon, excluding, the, constantinopolitan, creed, which, eventually, annexed, the, name, and, fame, of, the, creed, adopted, at, nicaea, three, councils, were, held, two, by, constantinople, one, by, rome, rome, attempted, to, replace, a, seated, patriarch, with, one, amenable, to, the, filioque, dispute, the, orthodox, responded, by, denouncing, the, replacement, and, excommunicating, the, pope, convening, the, roman, council, denouncing, the, pope, s, attempt, to, control, affairs, outside, the, purview, of, rome, and, denouncing, the, addition, of, filioque, as, a, heresy, each, church, recognizes, its, own, council, s, as, legitimate, and, does, not, recognize, the, other, s, council, s, in, 1053, leo, of, ohrid, at, the, instigation, according, to, j, b, bury, of, patriarch, michael, cerularius, of, constantinople, wrote, to, bishop, john, of, trani, a, letter, intended, for, all, the, latin, bishops, including, the, pope, in, which, he, attacked, western, practices, such, as, using, unleavened, bread, for, the, eucharist, and, fasting, rules, that, differed, from, those, in, constantinople, while, cerularius, himself, closed, all, latin, churches, in, constantinople, in, response, leo, ix, wrote, the, letter, in, terra, pax, of, 2, september, 1053, addressed, to, cerularius, and, leo, of, ohrid, in, which, he, speaks, at, length, of, the, privileges, granted, through, saint, peter, to, the, see, of, rome, in, one, of, the, 41, sections, of, his, letter, he, also, speaks, of, privileges, granted, by, the, emperors, quoting, from, the, donation, of, constantine, document, which, he, believed, to, be, genuine, section, 20, some, scholars, say, that, this, letter, was, never, actually, dispatched, but, was, set, aside, and, that, the, papal, reply, actually, sent, was, the, softer, but, still, harsh, letter, scripta, tuae, of, january, 1054, the, advance, of, the, norman, conquest, of, southern, italy, constituted, a, threat, to, the, possessions, of, both, the, byzantine, empire, and, the, papacy, each, of, which, sought, the, support, of, the, other, accordingly, conciliatory, letters, the, texts, of, which, have, not, been, preserved, were, written, to, the, pope, by, the, emperor, and, cerularius, in, his, january, 1054, reply, to, the, emperor, quantas, gratias, leo, ix, asks, for, his, assistance, against, the, normans, and, complains, of, what, the, pope, saw, as, caerularius, s, arrogance, in, his, reply, to, caerularius, he, upbraided, the, patriarch, for, trying, to, subject, the, patriarchs, of, alexandria, and, antioch, to, himself, and, for, adopting, the, title, of, ecumenical, patriarch, and, insisted, on, the, primacy, of, the, see, of, rome, these, two, letters, were, entrusted, to, a, delegation, of, three, legates, headed, by, the, undiplomatic, cardinal, humbert, of, silva, candida, and, also, including, frederick, of, lorraine, who, was, papal, secretary, and, cardinal, deacon, of, santa, maria, in, domnica, and, peter, archbishop, of, amalfi, they, were, given, friendship, and, support, by, the, emperor, but, were, spurned, by, the, patriarch, finally, on, 16, july, 1054, three, months, after, pope, leo, s, death, in, april, 1054, and, nine, months, before, the, next, pope, took, office, they, laid, on, the, altar, of, hagia, sophia, which, was, prepared, for, the, celebration, of, the, divine, liturgy, a, bull, of, excommunication, of, cerularius, and, his, supporters, at, a, synod, held, on, 20, july, 1054, cerularius, in, turn, excommunicated, the, legates, in, reality, only, michael, may, have, been, excommunicated, along, with, his, then, living, adherents, there, was, no, single, event, that, marked, the, breakdown, rather, the, two, churches, slid, into, and, out, of, schism, over, a, period, of, several, centuries, punctuated, with, temporary, reconciliations, efforts, were, made, in, subsequent, centuries, by, emperors, popes, and, patriarchs, to, heal, the, rift, between, the, churches, however, a, number, of, factors, and, historical, events, worked, to, widen, the, separation, over, time, it, is, estimated, that, in, 1054, a, slim, majority, of, christians, worldwide, were, eastern, christians, most, of, the, rest, were, western, christians, few, of, these, would, have, noticed, any, difference, as, noted, by, timothy, ware, even, after, 1054, friendly, relations, between, east, and, west, continued, the, two, parts, of, christendom, were, not, yet, conscious, of, a, great, gulf, of, separation, between, them, the, dispute, remained, something, of, which, ordinary, christians, in, east, and, west, were, largely, unaware, at, the, time, of, the, excommunications, many, contemporary, historians, including, byzantine, chroniclers, did, not, consider, the, event, significant, relations, continued, as, usual, for, instance, endownments, made, towards, churches, in, the, east, such, as, the, holy, sepulchre, were, kept, in, place, and, pope, gregory, vii, confirmed, the, proprietorship, of, the, patriarch, of, jerusalem, over, a, church, in, le, marche, in, the, pyrenees, when, emperor, alexios, komnenos, asked, in, the, 1080s, whether, a, canonical, decision, had, been, made, to, break, relations, with, rome, the, participants, of, the, synod, of, constantinople, said, no, interactions, in, the, 12th, century, between, the, latin, crusaders, and, the, indigenous, population, show, that, rather, than, the, former, considering, the, latter, as, heretics, or, schismatics, they, incorporated, local, hierarchies, into, their, own, starting, from, the, late, 11th, century, the, dependency, of, the, byzantine, empire, on, the, navies, of, the, republic, of, venice, and, to, a, lesser, extent, the, republic, of, genoa, and, the, republic, of, pisa, led, to, the, predominance, of, catholic, merchants, in, byzantium, which, had, received, major, trading, concessions, since, the, 1080s, subsequently, causing, economic, and, social, upheaval, together, with, the, perceived, arrogance, of, the, italians, it, fueled, popular, resentment, amongst, the, middle, and, lower, classes, both, in, the, countryside, and, in, the, cities, by, the, second, half, of, the, 12th, century, the, practically, uncontrollable, rivalry, among, competitors, from, the, different, city, states, devolved, to, the, point, that, italians, were, raiding, the, quarters, of, other, italians, in, the, capital, and, retaliatory, draconian, measures, by, the, byzantine, authorities, led, to, the, deterioration, of, inter, religious, relations, in, the, city, when, in, 1182, the, regency, of, the, empress, mother, maria, of, antioch, an, ethnic, french, notorious, for, the, favouritism, shown, to, latin, merchants, and, the, big, aristocratic, land, owners, was, deposed, by, andronikos, i, komnenos, in, the, wake, of, popular, support, the, new, emperor, allowed, mobs, to, massacre, the, hated, foreigners, henceforth, byzantine, foreign, policy, was, invariably, perceived, as, sinister, and, anti, latin, in, the, west, byzantine, theologian, theodore, balsamon, wrote, in, 1190, that, no, latin, should, be, given, sacraments, unless, he, first, declares, that, he, will, abstain, from, latin, dogmas, and, customs, and, conform, to, eastern, practices, however, he, was, still, criticized, for, excessive, harshness, by, contemporaries, such, as, archbishop, demetrios, chomatenos, who, pointed, out, that, latins, had, not, been, condemned, as, heretics, and, were, not, in, complete, schism, although, he, did, not, state, whether, latins, should, be, given, communion, or, vice, versa, in, the, course, of, the, fourth, crusade, of, 1202, 1204, latin, crusaders, and, venetian, merchants, sacked, constantinople, itself, 1204, looting, the, church, of, holy, wisdom, and, various, other, orthodox, holy, sites, and, converting, them, to, latin, catholic, worship, the, norman, crusaders, also, destroyed, the, imperial, library, of, constantinople, various, holy, artifacts, from, these, orthodox, holy, places, were, taken, to, the, west, the, crusaders, also, appointed, a, latin, patriarch, of, constantinople, the, conquest, of, constantinople, and, the, final, treaty, established, the, latin, empire, of, the, east, and, the, latin, patriarch, of, constantinople, with, various, other, crusader, states, later, some, religious, artifacts, were, sold, in, europe, to, finance, or, fund, the, latin, empire, in, byzantium, as, when, emperor, baldwin, ii, of, constantinople, r, 1228, 1261, sold, the, relic, of, the, crown, of, thorns, while, in, france, trying, to, raise, new, funds, to, maintain, his, hold, on, byzantium, in, 1261, the, byzantine, emperor, michael, viii, palaiologos, brought, the, latin, empire, to, an, end, however, the, western, attack, on, the, heart, of, the, byzantine, empire, is, seen, as, a, factor, that, led, eventually, to, its, conquest, by, ottoman, muslims, in, the, 15th, century, many, scholars, believe, that, the, 1204, sacking, of, constantinople, contributed, more, to, the, schism, than, the, events, of, 1054, in, northern, europe, the, teutonic, knights, after, their, 12th, and, 13th, century, successes, in, the, northern, crusades, attempted, 1240, to, conquer, the, eastern, orthodox, russian, republics, of, pskov, and, novgorod, an, enterprise, somewhat, endorsed, by, pope, gregory, ix, r, 1227, 1241, one, of, the, major, defeats, the, teutonic, knights, suffered, was, the, battle, of, the, ice, in, 1242, catholic, sweden, also, undertook, several, campaigns, against, orthodox, novgorod, there, were, also, conflicts, between, catholic, poland, and, orthodox, russia, which, helped, solidify, the, schism, between, east, and, west, the, second, council, of, lyon, was, convoked, to, act, on, a, pledge, by, michael, viii, to, reunite, the, eastern, church, with, the, west, wishing, to, end, the, great, schism, that, divided, rome, and, constantinople, gregory, x, had, sent, an, embassy, to, michael, viii, who, had, reconquered, constantinople, putting, an, end, to, the, remnants, of, the, latin, empire, in, the, east, and, he, asked, latin, despots, in, the, east, to, curb, their, ambitions, on, 29, june, the, feast, of, saints, peter, and, paul, a, patronal, feast, of, the, popes, gregory, x, celebrated, a, mass, in, st, john, s, church, where, both, sides, took, part, the, council, declared, that, the, roman, church, possessed, the, supreme, and, full, primacy, and, authority, over, the, universal, catholic, church, the, union, effected, was, a, sham, and, a, political, gambit, a, fiction, maintained, by, the, emperor, to, prevent, westerners, from, recovering, the, city, of, constantinople, which, they, had, lost, just, over, a, decade, before, in, 1261, it, was, fiercely, opposed, by, clergy, and, people, and, never, put, into, effect, in, spite, of, a, sustained, campaign, by, patriarch, john, xi, of, constantinople, john, bekkos, a, convert, to, the, cause, of, union, to, defend, the, union, intellectually, and, vigorous, and, brutal, repression, of, opponents, by, michael, in, 1278, pope, nicholas, iii, learning, of, the, fictitious, character, of, greek, conformity, sent, legates, to, constantinople, demanding, the, personal, submission, of, every, orthodox, cleric, and, adoption, of, the, filioque, as, already, the, greek, delegates, at, lyon, had, been, required, to, recite, the, creed, with, the, inclusion, of, filioque, and, to, repeat, it, two, more, times, emperor, michael, s, attempts, to, resolve, the, schism, ended, when, pope, martin, iv, seeing, that, the, union, was, only, a, sham, excommunicated, michael, viii, in, 1281, in, support, of, charles, of, anjou, s, attempts, to, mount, a, new, campaign, to, retake, the, eastern, roman, provinces, lost, to, michael, michael, viii, s, son, and, successor, andronicus, ii, repudiated, the, union, and, bekkos, was, forced, to, abdicate, being, eventually, exiled, and, imprisoned, until, his, death, in, 1297, in, the, 15th, century, the, eastern, emperor, john, viii, palaiologos, pressed, hard, by, the, ottoman, turks, was, keen, to, ally, himself, with, the, west, and, to, do, so, he, arranged, with, pope, eugene, iv, for, discussions, about, the, reunion, to, be, held, again, this, time, at, the, council, of, ferrara, florence, after, several, long, discussions, the, emperor, managed, to, convince, the, eastern, representatives, to, accept, the, western, doctrines, of, filioque, purgatory, and, the, supremacy, of, the, papacy, on, 6, june, 1439, an, agreement, was, signed, by, all, the, eastern, bishops, present, but, one, mark, of, ephesus, who, held, that, rome, continued, in, both, heresy, and, schism, it, seemed, that, the, great, schism, had, been, ended, however, upon, their, return, the, eastern, bishops, found, their, agreement, with, the, west, broadly, rejected, by, the, populace, and, by, civil, authorities, with, the, notable, exception,

the, methods, of, restoration, of, the, uniate, church, structures, in, ukraine, as, well, as, what, it, called, catholic, proselytism, in, russia, in, 1993, a, report, written, by, the, joint, international, commission, for, theological, dialogue, between, the, catholic, church, and, the, orthodox, church, during, its, 7th, plenary, session, at, the, balamand, school, of, theology, in, lebanon, stated, because, of, the, way, in, which, catholics, and, orthodox, once, again, consider, each, other, in, their, relationship, to, the, mystery, of, the, church, and, discover, each, other, once, again, as, sister, churches, this, form, of, missionary, apostolate, described, above, and, which, has, been, called, uniatism, can, no, longer, be, accepted, either, as, a, method, to, be, followed, nor, as, a, model, of, the, unity, our, churches, are, seeking, at, the, same, time, the, document, inter, alia, stated, in, february, 2016, pope, francis, and, patriarch, kirill, of, the, russian, orthodox, church, roc, had, a, meeting, in, cuba, and, signed, a, joint, declaration, that, stated, inter, alia, it, is, our, hope, that, our, meeting, may, also, contribute, to, reconciliation, wherever, tensions, exist, between, greek, catholics, and, orthodox, it, is, today, clear, that, the, past, method, of, uniatism, understood, as, the, union, of, one, community, to, the, other, separating, it, from, its, church, is, not, the, way, to, re, establish, unity, nonetheless, the, ecclesial, communities, which, emerged, in, these, historical, circumstances, have, the, right, to, exist, and, to, undertake, all, that, is, necessary, to, meet, the, spiritual, needs, of, their, faithful, while, seeking, to, live, in, peace, with, their, neighbours, orthodox, and,

ukrainian, greek, catholic, church, and, the, roc, s, ukrainian, orthodox, church, had, been, recently, heightened, mainly, due, to, the, conflict, in, ukraine, the, declaration, was, sharply, criticised, by, sviatoslav, shevchuk, the, primate, of, the, ukrainian, greek, catholic, church, who, said, that, his, flock, felt, betrayed, by, the, vatican, inspired, by, vatican, ii, that, adopted, the, unitatis, redintegratio, decree, on, ecumenism, in, 1964, as, well, as, the, change, of, heart, toward, ecumenism, on, the, part, of, the, moscow, patriarchate, that, had, occurred, in,

demetrius, i, and, bartholomew, i, in, greek, without, the, filioque, clause, according, to, the, usage, of, the, byzantine, churches, this, accords, with, the, catholic, church, s, practice, of, including, the, clause, when, reciting, the, creed, in, latin, but, not, when, reciting, it, in, greek, in, june, 1995, patriarch, bartholomew, i, of, constantinople, visited, vatican, city, for, the,

the, excommunications, of, the, past, to, oblivion, and, to, set, out, on, the, way, to, re, establishing, full, communion, in, may, 1999, john, paul, ii, was, the, first, pope, since, the, great, schism, to, visit, an, eastern, orthodox, country, romania, upon, greeting, john, paul, ii, the, romanian, patriarch, teoctist, stated, the, second, millennium, of, christian, history, began, with, a, painful, wounding, of, the, unity, of, the, church, the, end, of, this, millennium, has, seen, a, real, commitment, to, restoring, christian, unity, john, paul, ii, visited, other, heavily, orthodox, areas, such, as, ukraine, despite, lack, of, welcome, at, times, and, he, said, that, healing, the, divisions, between, western, and, eastern, christianity, was, one, of, his, fondest, wishes, in, june, 2004, bartholomew, i, s, visit, to, rome, for, the, feast, of, saints, peter, and, paul, 29, june, afforded, him, the, opportunity, for, another, personal, meeting, with, john, paul, ii, for, conversations, with, the, pontifical, council, for, promoting, christian, unity, and, for, taking, part, in, the, celebration, for, the, feast, day, in, st, peter, s, basilica, the, patriarch, s,

himself, full, participation, in, the, liturgy, of, the, word, a, joint, proclamation, by, the, pope, and, by, the, patriarch, of, the, profession, of, faith, according, to, the, nicene, constantinopolitan, creed, in, greek, and, as, the, conclusion, the, final, blessing, imparted, by, both, the, pope, and, the, patriarch, at, the, altar, of, the, confessio, the, patriarch, did, not, fully, participate, in, the, liturgy, of, the, eucharist, involving, the, consecration, and, distribution, of, the, eucharist, itself, despite, efforts, on, the, part, of, catholic, popes, and, orthodox, patriarchs, to, heal, the, schism, only, limited, progress, towards, reconciliation, has, been, made, over, the, last, half, century, one, stumbling, block, is, the, fact, that, the, orthodox, and, the, catholics, have, different, perceptions, of, the, nature, of, the, divide, the, official, catholic, teaching, is, that, the, orthodox, are, schismatic, meaning, that, there, is, nothing, heretical, about, their, theology, and, their, unwillingness, to, accept, the, supremacy, of, the, pope, is, presented, in, catholic, teaching, as, chiefly, an, ecclesiological, issue, not, so, much, a, theological, one, the, orthodox, object, to, the, catholic, doctrines, of, purgatory, substitutionary, atonement, the, immaculate, conception, and, papal, supremacy, among, others, as, heretical, doctrines, with, respect, to, primacy, of, the, pope, the, two, churches, agree, that, the, pope, as, bishop, of, rome, has, primacy, although, they, continue, to, have, different, interpretations, of, what, that, primacy, entails, the, catholic, church, s, attitude, was, expressed, by, john, paul, ii, in, the, image, of, the, church, breathing, with, her, two, lungs, he, meant, that, there, should, be, a, combination, of, the, more, rational, juridical, organization, minded, latin, temperament, with, the, intuitive, mystical, and, contemplative, spirit, found, in, the, east, in, the, orthodox, view, the, bishop, of, rome, i, e, the, pope, would, have, universal, primacy, in, a, reunited, christendom, as, primus, inter, pares, without, the, power, of, jurisdiction, the, eastern, orthodox, insist, that, the, primacy, is, largely, one, of, honor, the, pope, being, first, among, equals, primus, inter, pares, the, catholic, church, on, the, other, hand, insists, on, the, doctrine, of, supremacy, it, is, widely, understood, that, if, there, is, to, be, reconciliation, both, sides, will, have, to, compromise, on, this, doctrine, although, some, commentators, have, proposed, ways, in, which, such, compromise, can, be, achieved, there, is, no, official, indication, that, such, compromise, is, being, contemplated, in, his, book, principles, of, catholic, theology, pope, benedict, xvi, then, cardinal, ratzinger, assessed, the, range, of, possibilities, that, are, open, to, christian, ecumenism, he, characterized, the, maximum, demand, of, the, west, as, the, recognition, by, the, east, of, and, submission, to, the, primacy, of, the, bishop, of, rome, in, the, full, scope, of, the, definition, of, 1870, the, maximum, demand, of, the, east, was, described, as, a, declaration, by, the, west, of, the, 1870, doctrine, of, papal, primacy, as, erroneous, along, with, the, removal, of, the, filioque, from, the, creed, and, including, the, marian, dogmas, of, the, nineteenth, and, twentieth, centuries, ratzinger, asserted, that, n, one, of, the, maximum, solutions, offers, any, real, hope, of, unity, ratzinger, wrote, that, rome, must, not, require, more, from, the, east, than, had, been, formulated, and, what, was, lived, in, the, first, millennium, he, concluded, that, reunion, could, take, place, in, this, context, if, on, the, one, hand, the, east, would, cease, to, oppose, as, heretical, the, developments, that, took, place, in, the, west, in, the, second, millennium, and, would, accept, the, catholic, church, as, legitimate, and, orthodox, in, the, form, she, had, acquired, in, the, course, of, that, development, while, on, the, other, hand, the, west, would, recognize, the, church, of, the, east, as, orthodox, in, the, form, she, has, always, had, the, declaration, of, ravenna, in, 2007, re, asserted, the, belief, that, the, bishop, of, rome, is, indeed, the, protos, although, future, discussions, are, to, be, held, on, the, concrete, ecclesiological, exercise, of, papal, primacy, some, scholars, such, as, jeffrey, finch, assert, that, the, future, of, east, west, rapprochement, appears, to, be, overcoming, the, modern, polemics, of, neo, scholasticism, and, neo, palamism, these, doctrinal, issues, center, around, the, orthodox, perception, that, the, catholic, theologians, lack, the, actual, experience, of, god, called, theoria, and, thereby, fail, to, understand, the, importance, of, the, heart, as, a, noetic, or, intuitive, faculty, it, is, what, they, consider, to, be, the, catholic, church, s, reliance, on, pagan, metaphysical, philosophy, and, rational, methods, such, as, scholasticism, rather, than, on, the, intuitive, experience, of, god, theoria, that, causes, orthodox, to, consider, the, catholic, church, heretical, other, points, of, doctrinal, difference, include, a, difference, regarding, human, nature, as, well, as, a, difference, regarding, original, sin, purgatory, and, the, nature, of, hell, one, point, of, theological, difference, is, embodied, in, the, dispute, regarding, the, inclusion, of, the, filioque, in, the, nicene, creed, in, the, view, of, the, catholic, church, what, it, calls, the, legitimate, complementarity, of, the, expressions, from, the, father, and, from, the, father, and, the, son, does, not, provide, it, does, not, become, rigid, affect, the, identity, of, faith, in, the, reality, of, the, same, mystery, confessed, the, orthodox, on, the, other, hand, view, inclusion, of, the, phrase, to, be, almost, heretical, see, also, the, trinity, section, more, importantly, the, orthodox, see, the, filioque, as, just, the, tip, of, the, iceberg, and, really, just, a, symptom, of, a, much, more, deeply, rooted, problem, of, theology, one, so, deeply, rooted, that, they, consider, it, to, be, heretical, and, even, by, some, characterizations, an, inability, to, see, god, and, know, god, this, heresy, is, allegedly, rooted, in, frankish, paganism, arianism, platonist, and, aristotelian, philosophy, and, thomist, rational, and, objective, scholasticism, in, opposition, to, what, they, characterize, as, pagan, heretical, and, godless, foundations, the, orthodox, rely, on, intuitive, and, mystical, knowledge, and, vision, of, god, theoria, based, on, hesychasm, and, noesis, catholics, accept, as, valid, the, eastern, orthodox, intuitive, and, mystical, understanding, of, god, and, consider, it, complementary, to, the, rational, western, reflection, most, orthodox, churches, through, economy, do, not, require, baptism, in, the, orthodox, church, for, one, who, has, been, previously, baptized, in, the, catholic, church, most, orthodox, jurisdictions, based, on, that, same, principle, of, economy, allow, a, sacramental, marriage, between, an, orthodox, christian, and, some, non, orthodox, christians, the, catholic, church, allows, its, clergy, to, administer, the, sacraments, of, penance, the, eucharist, and, anointing, of, the, sick, to, members, of, the, eastern, orthodox, church, if, these, spontaneously, ask, for, the, sacraments, and, are, properly, disposed, it, also, allows, catholics, who, cannot, approach, a, catholic, minister, to, receive, these, three, sacraments, from, the, clergy, of, the, eastern, orthodox, church, whenever, necessity, requires, or, a, genuine, spiritual, advantage, commends, it, and, provided, the, danger, of, error, or, indifferentism, is, avoided, catholic, canon, law, allows, marriage, between, a, catholic, and, an, orthodox, the, orthodox, church, will, only, administer, the, sacraments, to, christians, who, aren, t, orthodox, if, there, is, an, emergency, the, code, of, canons, of, the, eastern, churches, authorizes, the, local, catholic, bishop, to, permit, a, catholic, priest, of, whatever, rite, to, bless, the, marriage, of, orthodox, faithful, who, being, unable, without, great, difficulty, to, approach, a, priest, of, their, own, church, ask, for, this, spontaneously, in, exceptional, circumstances, catholics, may, in, the, absence, of, an, authorized, priest, marry, before, witnesses, if, a, priest, who, is, not, authorized, for, the, celebration, of, the, marriage, is, available, he, should, be, called, in, although, the, marriage, is, valid, even, without, his, presence, the, code, of, canons, of, the, eastern, churches, specifies, that, in, those, exceptional, circumstances, even, a, non, catholic, priest, and, so, not, necessarily, one, belonging, to, an, eastern, church, may, be, called, in, the, efforts, of, orthodox, patriarchs, towards, reconciliation, with, the, catholic, church, has, been, strongly, criticized, by, some, elements, of, eastern, orthodoxy, such, as, the, metropolitan, of, kalavryta, greece, in, november, 2008, in, 2010, patriarch, bartholomew, i, issued, an, encyclical, lauding, the, ongoing, dialogue, between, the, orthodox, church, and, other, christian, churches, and, lamenting, that, the, dialogues, between, the, two, churches, were, being, criticized, in, an, unacceptably, fanatical, way, by, some, who, claim, to, be, defenders, of, orthodoxy, despite, the, fact, that, these, dialogues, are, being, conducted, with, the, mutual, agreement, and, participation, of, all, local, orthodox, churches, the, patriarch, warned, that, such, opponents, raise, themselves, above, episcopal, synods, and, risk, creating, schisms, he, further, accused, some, critics, of, distorting, reality, to, deceive, and, arouse, the, faithful, and, of, depicting, theological, dialogue, not, as, a, pan, orthodox, effort, but, an, effort, of, the, ecumenical, patriarchate, alone, as, an, example, he, pointed, to, false, rumors, that, union, between, the, roman, catholic, and, orthodox, churches, is, imminent, claiming, that, the, disseminators, of, such, rumors, were, fully, aware, that, the, differences, discussed, in, these, theological, dialogues, remain, numerous, and, require, lengthy, debate, the, patriarch, re, emphasized, that, union, is, not, decided, by, theological, commissions, but, by, church, synods, my, dearest, brother, we, do, not, deny, to, the, roman, church, the, primacy, amongst, the, five, sister, patriarchates, and, we, recognize, her, right, to, the, most, honorable, seat, at, an, ecumenical, council, but, she, has, separated, herself, from, us, by, her, own, deeds, when, through, pride, she, assumed, a, monarchy, which, does, not, belong, to, her, office, how, shall, we, accept, decrees, from, her, that, have, been, issued, without, consulting, us, and, even, without, our, knowledge, if, the, roman, pontiff, seated, on, the, lofty, throne, of, his, glory, wishes, to, thunder, at, us, and, so, to, speak, hurl, his, mandates, at, us, from, on, high, and, if, he, wishes, to, judge, us, and, even, to, rule, us, and, our, churches, not, by, taking, counsel, with, us, but, at, his, own, arbitrary, pleasure, what, kind, of, brotherhood, or, even, what, kind, of, parenthood, can, this, be, we, should, be, the, slaves, not, the, sons, of, such, a, church, and, the, roman, see, would, not, be, the, pious, mother, of, sons, but, a, hard, and, imperious, mistress, of, slaves
