000, 250, 000, years, ago, in, the, 4th, millenium, bc, written, history, arose, in, ancient, egypt, and, later, in, nubia, s, kush, the, horn, of, africa, s, d, mt, and, the, maghreb, s, and, ifrikiya, s, carthage, sub, saharan, societies, are, generally, termed, oral, rather, than, literate, civilisations, owing, to, their, use, of, oral, tradition, even, when, a, writing, system, has, historically, been, accessed, or, developed, for, example, the, jeli, tradition, in, the, mali, empire, and, the, oral, recordation, of, the, kouroukan, fouga, while, having, adapted, the, arabic,

regions, of, the, continent, with, historical, change, commonplace, many, states, were, created, through, conquest, and, insecurity, while, others, developed, through, the, borrowing, and, assimilation, of, ideas, and, institutions, and, some, through, internal, largely, isolated, development, stimulated, by, population, growth, and, economic, development, many, societies, are, horizontal, and, maintained, an, egalitarian, way, of, life, such, as, the, jola, baka, or, hadza, peoples, while, others, did, not, centralise, their, proto, states, further, and, stratify, into, complex, societies, such, as, the, kpelle, boorana, and, herero, peoples, and, are, rarely, discussed, in, political, history, in, historiography, the, conventional, universal, narrative, of, social, and, technological, progress, towards, capitalism, through, continuous, time, has, come, under, persistent, criticism, in, recent, decades, at, its, peak, it, is, estimated, that, africa, had, up, to, 10, 000, different, states, and, autonomous, groups, having, distinct, languages, and, customs, with, most, following, traditional, religions, many, empires, achieved, hegemony, in, their, respective, regions, such, as, ghana, mali, songhai, bamana, s, gou, massina, sokoto, and, the, toucouleur, in, west, africa, ancient, egypt, kush, carthage, the, fatimids, almoravids, almohads, ayyubids, and,

western, sahel, and, sudan, catalysed, by, the, fulani, jihad, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, systems, of, servitude, and, slavery, were, historically, widespread, and, commonplace, in, parts, of, africa, as, they, were, in, much, of, the, ancient, medieval, and, early, modern, world, when, the, trans, saharan, red, sea, indian, ocean, and, atlantic, slave, trades, began, many, of, the, pre, existing, local, slave, systems, started, supplying, captives, for, slave, markets, outside, africa, the, atlantic, slave, trade, was, narrowly, the, most, exploited, of, these, and, over, a, shorter, period, between, 1450, and, 1900, transported, upwards, of, 12, million, enslaved, people, overseas, from, 1870, to, 1914, driven, by, the, great, force, and, voracity, of, the, second,

struggles, for, independence, in, many, parts, of, the, continent, and, a, weakened, europe, after, the, second, world, war, waves, of, decolonisation, took, place, across, the, continent, this, culminated, in, the, 1960, year, of, africa, and, the, establishment, of, the, organisation, of, african, unity, in, 1963, the, predecessor, to, the, african, union, with, countries, deciding, to, keep, their, colonial, borders, traditional, power, structures, remain, partly, in, place, in, many, parts, of, africa, and, their, roles, powers, and, influence, vary, greatly, between, countries, especially, regarding, governance, the, first, known, hominids, evolved, in, africa, according, to, paleontology, the, early, hominids, skull, anatomy, was, similar, to, that, of, the, gorilla, and, the, chimpanzee, great, apes, that, also, evolved, in, africa, but, the, hominids, had, adopted, a, bipedal, locomotion, which, freed, their, hands, this, gave, them, a, crucial, advantage, enabling, them, to, live, in, both, forested, areas, and, on, the, open, savanna, at, a, time, when, africa, was, drying, up, and, the, savanna, was, encroaching, on, forested, areas, this, would, have, occurred, 10, to, 5, million, years, ago, but, these, claims, are, controversial, because, biologists, and, genetics, have, humans, appearing, around, the, last, 70, thousand, to, 200, thousand, years, the, fossil, record, shows, homo, sapiens, also, known, as, modern, humans, or, anatomically, modern, humans, living, in, africa, by, about, 350, 000, 260, 000, years, ago, the, earliest,

from, around, 3500, bc, a, coalition, of, horus, worshipping, nomes, in, the, western, nile, delta, conquered, the, andjety, worshipping, nomes, of, the, east, to, form, lower, egypt, whilst, set, worshipping, nomes, in, the, south, coalesced, to, form, upper, egypt, 62, 63, egypt, was, first, united, when, narmer, of, upper, egypt, conquered, lower, egypt, giving, rise, to, the, 1st, and, 2nd, dynasties, of, egypt, whose, efforts, presumably, consisted, of, conquest, and, consolidation, with, unification, completed, by, the, 3rd, dynasty, to, form, the, old, kingdom, of, egypt, in, 2686, bc, 63, the, kingdom, of, kerma, emerged, around, this, time, to, become, the, dominant, force, in, nubia, controlling, an, area, as, large, as, egypt, between, the, 1st, and, 4th, cataracts, of, the, nile, with, egyptian, records, speaking, of, its, rich, and, populous, agricultural, regions, the, height, of, the, old, kingdom, came, under, the, 4th, dynasty, who, constructed, numerous, great, pyramids, however, under, the, 6th, dynasty, of, egypt, power, began, to, decentralise, to, the, nomarchs, culminating, in, anarchy, exacerbated, by, drought, and, famine, in, 2200, bc, and, the, onset, of, the, first, intermediate, period, in, which, numerous, nomarchs, ruled, simultaneously, throughout, this, time, power, bases, were, built, and, destroyed, in, memphis, and, in, heracleopolis, when, mentuhotep, ii, of, thebes, and, the, 11th, dynasty, conquered, all, of, egypt, to, form, the, middle, kingdom, in, 2055, bc, the, 12th, dynasty, oversaw, advancements, in, irrigation, and, economic, expansion, in, the, faiyum, oasis, as, well, as, expansion, into, lower, nubia, at, the, expense, of, kerma, in, 1700, bc, egypt, fractured, in, two, ushering, in, the, second, intermediate, period, 68, 71, the, hyksos, a, militaristic, people, from, palestine, capitalised, on, this, fragmentation, and, conquered, lower, egypt, establishing, the, 15th, dynasty, of, egypt, whilst, kerma, coordinated, invasions, deep, into, egypt, to, reach, its, greatest, extent, looting, royal, statues, and, monuments, a, rival, power, base, developed, in, thebes, with, ahmose, i, of, the, 18th, dynasty, eventually, expelling, the, hyksos, from, egypt, forming, the, new, kingdom, in, 1550, bc, utilising, the, military, technology, the, hyksos, had, brought, they, conducted, numerous, campaigns, to, conquer, the, levant, from, the, canaanites, amorites, hittites, and, mitanni, and, extinguish, kerma, incorporating, nubia, into, the, empire, sending, the, egyptian, empire, into, its, golden, age, 73, internal, struggles, drought, and, famine, and, invasions, by, a, confederation, of, seafaring, peoples, contributed, to, the, new, kingdom, s, collapse, in, 1069, bc, ushering, in, the, third, intermediate, period, which, saw, egypt, fractured, into, many, pieces, amid, widespread, turmoil, 76, 77, egypt, s, disintegration, liberated, the, more, egyptianized, kingdom, of, kush, in, nubia, and, later, in, the, 8th, century, bc, the, kushite, king, kashta, would, expand, his, power, and, influence, by, manoeuvring, his, daughter, into, a, position, of, power, in, upper, egypt, paving, the, way, for, his, successor, piye, to, conquer, lower, egypt, and, form, the, kushite, empire, the, kushites, assimilated, further, into, egyptian, society, by, reaffirming, ancient, egyptian, religious, traditions, and, culture, while, introducing, some, unique, aspects, of, kushite, culture, and, overseeing, a, revival, in, pyramid, building, after, a, century, of, rule, they, were, forcibly, driven, out, of, egypt, by, the, assyrians, as, reprisal, for, the, kushites, agitating, peoples, within, the, assyrian, empire, in, an, attempt, to, gain, a, foothold, in, the, region, the, assyrians, installed, a, puppet, dynasty, which, later, gained, independence, and, once, more, unified, egypt, with, upper, egypt, becoming, a, rich, agricultural, region, whose, produce, lower, egypt, then, sold, and, traded, 77, in, 525, bc, egypt, was, conquered, by, the, expansive, achaemenids, however, later, regained, independence, in, 404, bc, until, 343, bc, when, it, was, re, annexed, by, the, achaemenid, empire, persian, rule, in, egypt, ended, with, the, defeat, of, the, achaemenids, by, alexander, the, great, in, 332, bc, marking, the, beginning, of, hellenistic, rule, by, the, macedonian, ptolemaic, dynasty, in, egypt, the, hellenistic, rulers, seeking, legitimacy, from, their, egyptian, subjects, gradually, egyptianized, and, participated, in, egyptian, religious, life, 119, following, the, syrian, wars, with, the, seleucid, empire, the, ptolemaic, kingdom, lost, its, holdings, in, outside, africa, but, expanded, its, territory, by, conquering, cyrenaica, from, its, respective, tribes, and, subjugated, kush, beginning, in, the, mid, second, century, bc, dynastic, strife, and, a, series, of, foreign, wars, weakened, the, kingdom, and, it, became, increasingly, reliant, on, the, roman, republic, under, cleopatra, vii, who, sought, to, restore, ptolemaic, power, egypt, became, entangled, in, a, roman, civil, war, which, ultimately, led, to, its, conquest, by, rome, in, 30, bc, the, crisis, of, the, third, century, in, the, roman, empire, freed, the, levantine, city, state, of, palmyra, who, conquered, egypt, however, their, rule, lasted, only, a, few, years, before, egypt, was, reintegrated, into, the, roman, empire, in, the, midst, of, this, kush, regained, total, independence, from, egypt, and, they, would, persist, as, a, major, regional, power, until, having, been, weakened, from, internal, rebellion, amid, worsening, climatic, conditions, invasions, by, both, the, aksumites, and, the, noba, caused, their, disintegration, into, makuria, alodia, and, nobatia, in, the, 5th, century, ad, whilst, the, romans, managed, to, hold, on, to, egypt, for, the, rest, of, the, ancient, period, in, the, horn, of, africa, there, was, the, land, of, punt, a, kingdom, on, the, red, sea, likely, located, in, modern, day, eritrea, or, northern, somaliland, the, ancient, egyptians, initially, traded, via, middle, men, with, punt, until, in, 2350, bc, when, they, established, direct, relations, they, would, become, close, trading, partners, for, over, a, millennium, with, punt, exchanging, gold,

archaeological, discoveries, indicating, the, possibility, of, other, unknown, sophisticated, civilisations, at, this, time, after, d, mt, s, fall, in, the, 5th, century, bc, the, ethiopian, plateau, came, to, be, ruled, by, numerous, smaller, unknown, kingdoms, who, experienced, strong, south, arabian, influence, until, the, growth, and, expansion, of, aksum, in, the, 1st, century, bc, along, the, horn, s, coast, there, were, many, ancient, somali, city, states, which, thrived, off, of, the, wider, red, sea, trade, and, transported, their, cargo, via, beden, exporting, myrrh, frankincense, spices, gum, incense, and, ivory, with, freedom, from, roman, interference, causing, indians, to, give, the, cities, a, lucrative, monopoly, on, cinnamon, from, ancient, india, the, kingdom, of, aksum, grew, from, a, principality, into, a, major, power, on, the, trade, route, between, rome, and, india, through, conquering, its, unfortunately, unknown, neighbours, gaining, a, monopoly, on, indian, ocean, trade, in, the, region, aksum, s, rise, had, them, rule, over, much, of, the, regions, from, the, lake, tana, to, the, valley, of, the, nile, and, they, further, conquered, parts, of, the, ailing, kingdom, of, kush, led, campaigns, against, the, noba, and, beja, peoples, and, expanded, into, south, arabia, this, led, the, persian, prophet, mani, to, consider, aksum, as, one, of, the, four, great, powers, of, the, 3rd, century, alongside, persia, rome, and, china, in, the, 4th, century, ad, aksum, s, king, converted, to, christianity, and, aksum, s, population, who, had,

of, najran, the, aksumites, implanted, a, puppet, on, the, himyarite, throne, however, a, coup, d, tat, in, 522, brought, dhu, nuwas, back, to, power, who, again, began, persecuting, christians, the, aksumites, invaded, again, in, 525, and, with, byzantine, aid, conquered, the, kingdom, incorporating, it, as, a, vassal, state, after, some, minor, internal, conflict, in, the, late, 6th, century,

cradle, of, civilisation, in, egypt, by, the, libyan, desert, exacerbated, by, egyptian, boats, being, tailored, to, the, nile, and, not, coping, well, in, the, open, mediterranean, sea, this, caused, its, societies, to, develop, contiguous, to, those, of, southern, europe, until, phoenician, settlements, came, to, dominate, the, most, lucrative, trading, locations, in, the, gulf, of, tunis, initially, searching, for, sources, of, metal, 247, phoenician, settlements, subsequently, grew, into, ancient, carthage, after, gaining, independence, from, phoenicia, in, the, 6th, century, bc, and,
