the, chernobyl, disaster, began, on, 26, april, 1986, with, the, explosion, of, the, no, 4, reactor, of, the, chernobyl, nuclear, power, plant, near, the, city, of, pripyat, in, northern, ukraine, near, the, belarus, border, in, the, soviet, union, it, is, one, of, only, two, nuclear, energy, accidents, rated, at, the, maximum, severity, on, the, international, nuclear, event, scale, the, other, being, the, 2011, fukushima, nuclear, accident, the, response, involved, more, than, 500, 000, personnel, and, cost, an, estimated, 18, billion, roubles, around, us, 68, billion, in, 2019, it, remains, the, worst, nuclear, disaster, in, history, and, the, costliest, disaster, in, human, history, with, an, estimated, cost, of, us, 700, billion, the, disaster, occurred, while, running, a, test, to, simulate, cooling, the, reactor, during, an, accident, in, blackout, conditions, the, operators, carried, out, the, test, despite, an, accidental, drop, in, reactor, power, and, due, to, a, design, issue, attempting, to, shut, down, the, reactor, in, those, conditions, resulted, in, a, dramatic, power, surge, the, reactor, components, ruptured, lost, coolants, and, the, resulting, steam, explosions, and, meltdown, destroyed, the, containment, building, followed, by, a, reactor, core, fire, that, spread, radioactive, contaminants, across, the, ussr, and, europe, a, 10, kilometre, 6, 2, mi, exclusion, zone, was, established, 36, hours, after, the, accident, initially, evacuating, around, 49, 000, people, the, exclusion, zone, was, later, expanded, to, 30, kilometres, 19, mi, resulting, in, the, evacuation, of, approximately, 68, 000, more, people, following, the, explosion, which, killed, two, engineers, and, severely, burned, two, others, an, emergency, operation, began, to, put, out, the, fires, and, stabilize, the, reactor, of, the, 237, workers, hospitalized, 134, showed, symptoms, of, acute, radiation, syndrome, ars, 28, of, them, died, within, three, months, over, the, next, decade, 14, more, workers, nine, of, whom, had, ars, died, of, various, causes, mostly, unrelated, to, radiation, exposure, it, is, the, only, instance, in, commercial, nuclear, power, history, where, radiation, related, fatalities, occurred, as, of, 2011, 15, childhood, thyroid, cancer, deaths, were, attributed, to, the, disaster, the, united, nations, scientific, committee, on, the, effects, of, atomic, radiation, estimates, fewer, than, 100, deaths, have, resulted, from, the, fallout, predictions, of, the, eventual, total, death, toll, vary, a, 2006, world, health, organization, study, projected, 9, 000, cancer, related, fatalities, in, ukraine, belarus, and, russia, pripyat, was, abandoned, and, replaced, by, the, purpose, built, city, of, slavutych, the, chernobyl, nuclear, power, plant, sarcophagus, completed, in, december, 1986, reduced, the, spread, of, radioactive, contamination, and, provided, radiological, protection, for, the, crews, of, the, undamaged, reactors, in, 2016, 2018, the, chernobyl, new, safe, confinement, was, constructed, around, the, old, sarcophagus, to, enable, the, removal, of, the, reactor, debris, with, clean, up, scheduled, for, completion, by, 2065, in, nuclear, reactor, operation, most, heat, is, generated, by, nuclear, fission, but, over, 6, comes, from, radioactive, decay, heat, which, continues, after, the, reactor, shuts, down, continued, coolant, circulation, is, essential, to, prevent, core, overheating, or, a, core, meltdown, rbmk, reactors, like, those, at, chernobyl, use, water, as, a, coolant, circulated, by, electrically, driven, pumps, reactor, no, 4, had, 1, 661, individual, fuel, channels, requiring, over, 12, million, us, gallons, per, hour, for, the, entire, reactor, in, case, of, a, total, power, loss, each, of, chernobyl, s, reactors, had, three, backup, diesel, generators, but, they, took, 60, 75, seconds, to, reach, full, load, and, generate, the, 5, 5, mw, needed, to, run, one, main, pump, 15, special, counterweights, on, each, pump, provided, coolant, via, inertia, to, bridge, the, gap, to, generator, startup, however, a, potential, safety, risk, existed, in, the, event, that, a, station, blackout, occurred, simultaneously, with, the, rupture, of, a, coolant, pipe, in, this, scenario, the, emergency, core, cooling, system, eccs, is, needed, to, pump, additional, water, into, the, core, it, had, been, theorized, that, the, rotational, momentum, of, the, reactor, s, steam, turbine, could, be, used, to, generate, the, required, electrical, power, to, operate, the, eccs, via, the, feedwater, pumps, the, turbine, s, speed, would, run, down, as, energy, was, taken, from, it, but, analysis, indicated, that, there, might, be, sufficient, energy, to, provide, electrical, power, to, run, the, coolant, pumps, for, 45, seconds, 16, this, would, not, quite, bridge, the, gap, between, an, external, power, failure, and, the, full, availability, of, the, emergency, generators, but, would, alleviate, the, situation, the, turbine, run, down, energy, capability, still, needed, to, be, confirmed, experimentally, and, previous, tests, had, ended, unsuccessfully, an, initial, test, carried, out, in, 1982, indicated, that, the, excitation, voltage, of, the, turbine, generator, was, insufficient, the, electrical, system, was, modified, and, the, test, was, repeated, in, 1984, but, again, proved, unsuccessful, in, 1985, the, test, was, conducted, a, third, time, but, also, yielded, no, results, due, to, a, problem, with, the, recording, equipment, the, test, procedure, was, to, be, run, again, in, 1986, and, was, scheduled, to, take, place, during, a, controlled, power, down, of, reactor, no, 4, which, was, preparatory, to, a, planned, maintenance, outage, 51, a, test, procedure, had, been, written, but, the, authors, were, not, aware, of, the, unusual, rbmk, 1000, reactor, behaviour, under, the, planned, operating, conditions, 52, it, was, regarded, as, purely, an, electrical, test, of, the, generator, even, though, it, involved, critical, unit, systems, according, to, the, existing, regulations, such, a, test, did, not, require, approval, by, either, the, chief, design, authority, for, the, reactor, nikiet, or, the, nuclear, safety, regulator, 51, 52, the, test, program, called, for, disabling, the, emergency, core, cooling, system, a, passive, active, system, of, core, cooling, intended, to, provide, water, to, the, core, in, a, loss, of, coolant, accident, approval, from, the, site, chief, engineer, had, been, obtained, according, to, regulations, 18, the, test, procedure, was, intended, to, run, as, follows, the, test, was, to, be, conducted, during, the, day, shift, of, 25, april, 1986, as, part, of, a, scheduled, reactor, shutdown, the, day, shift, had, been, instructed, in, advance, on, the, reactor, operating, conditions, to, run, the, test, and, a, special, team, of, electrical, engineers, was, present, to, conduct, the, electrical, test, once, the, correct, conditions, were, reached, as, planned, a, gradual, reduction, in, the, output, of, the, power, unit, began, at, 01, 06, on, 25, april, and, the, power, level, had, reached, 50, of, its, nominal, 3, 200, mw, thermal, level, by, the, beginning, of, the, day, shift, 53, the, day, shift, was, scheduled, to, perform, the, test, at, 14, 15, 3, preparations, for, the, test, were, carried, out, including, the, disabling, of, the, emergency, core, cooling, system, 53, meanwhile, another, regional, power, station, unexpectedly, went, offline, at, 14, 00, 53, the, kiev, electrical, grid, controller, requested, that, the, further, reduction, of, chernobyl, s, output, be, postponed, as, power, was, needed, to, satisfy, the, peak, evening, demand, soon, the, day, shift, was, replaced, by, the, evening, shift, 3, despite, the, delay, the, emergency, core, cooling, system, was, left, disabled, this, system, had, to, be, disconnected, via, a, manual, isolating, slide, valve, 51, which, in, practice, meant, that, two, or, three, people, spent, the, whole, shift, manually, turning, sailboat, helm, sized, valve, wheels, 4, the, system, had, no, influence, on, the, disaster, but, allowing, the, reactor, to, run, for, 11, hours, outside, of, the, test, without, emergency, protection, was, indicative, of, a, general, lack, of, safety, culture, 10, 18, at, 23, 04, the, kiev, grid, controller, allowed, the, reactor, shutdown, to, resume, the, day, shift, had, long, since, departed, the, evening, shift, was, also, preparing, to, leave, and, the, night, shift, would, not, take, over, until, midnight, well, into, the, job, according, to, plan, the, test, should, have, been, finished, during, the, day, shift, and, the, night, shift, would, only, have, had, to, maintain, decay, heat, cooling, systems, in, an, otherwise, shut, down, plant, 36, 38, the, night, shift, had, very, limited, time, to, prepare, for, and, carry, out, the, experiment, anatoly, dyatlov, deputy, chief, engineer, of, the, chernobyl, nuclear, power, plant, chnpp, was, present, to, direct, the, test, he, was, one, of, the, test, s, chief, authors, and, he, was, the, highest, ranking, individual, present, unit, shift, supervisor, aleksandr, akimov, was, in, charge, of, the, unit, 4, night, shift, and, leonid, toptunov, was, the, senior, reactor, control, engineer, responsible, for, the, reactor, s, operational, regimen, including, the, movement, of, the, control, rods, 25, year, old, toptunov, had, worked, independently, as, a, senior, engineer, for, approximately, three, months, 36, 38, the, test, plan, called, for, a, gradual, decrease, in, reactor, power, to, a, thermal, level, of, 700, 1000, mw, and, an, output, of, 720, mw, was, reached, at, 00, 05, on, 26, april, 53, however, due, to, the, reactor, s, production, of, a, fission, byproduct, xenon, 135, which, is, a, reaction, inhibiting, neutron, absorber, power, continued, to, decrease, in, the, absence, of, further, operator, action, a, process, known, as, reactor, poisoning, in, steady, state, operation, this, is, avoided, because, xenon, 135, is, burned, off, as, quickly, as, it, is, created, becoming, highly, stable, xenon, 136, with, the, reactor, power, reduced, high, quantities, of, previously, produced, iodine, 135, were, decaying, into, the, neutron, absorbing, xenon, 135, faster, than, the, reduced, neutron, flux, could, burn, it, off, xenon, poisoning, in, this, context, made, reactor, control, more, difficult, but, was, a, predictable, phenomenon, during, such, a, power, reduction, when, the, reactor, power, had, decreased, to, approximately, 500, mw, the, reactor, power, control, was, switched, from, local, automatic, regulator, to, the, automatic, regulators, to, manually, maintain, the, required, power, level, 11, ar, 1, then, activated, removing, all, four, of, ar, 1, s, control, rods, automatically, but, ar, 2, failed, to, activate, due, to, an, imbalance, in, its, ionization, chambers, in, response, toptunov, reduced, power, to, stabilize, the, automatic, regulators, ionization, sensors, the, result, was, a, sudden, power, drop, to, an, unintended, near, shutdown, state, with, a, power, output, of, 30, mw, thermal, or, less, the, exact, circumstances, that, caused, the, power, drop, are, unknown, most, reports, attribute, the, power, drop, to, toptunov, s, error, but, dyatlov, reported, that, it, was, due, to, a, fault, in, the, ar, 2, system, 11, the, reactor, was, now, producing, only, 5, of, the, minimum, initial, power, level, prescribed, for, the, test, 73, this, low, reactivity, inhibited, the, burn, off, of, xenon, 135, 6, within, the, reactor, core, and, hindered, the, rise, of, reactor, power, to, increase, power, control, room, personnel, removed, numerous, control, rods, from, the, reactor, several, minutes, elapsed, before, the, reactor, was, restored, to, 160, mw, at, 00, 39, at, which, point, most, control, rods, were, at, their, upper, limits, but, the, rod, configuration, was, still, within, its, normal, operating, limit, with, operational, reactivity, margin, orm, equivalent, to, having, more, than, 15, rods, inserted, over, the, next, twenty, minutes, reactor, power, would, be, increased, further, to, 200, mw, 73, the, operation, of, the, reactor, at, the, low, power, level, was, accompanied, by, unstable, core, temperatures, and, coolant, flow, and, possibly, by, instability, of, neutron, flux, the, control, room, received, repeated, emergency, signals, regarding, the, low, levels, in, one, half, of, the, steam, water, separator, drums, with, accompanying, drum, separator, pressure, warnings, in, response, personnel, triggered, rapid, influxes, of, feedwater, relief, valves, opened, to, relieve, excess, steam, into, a, turbine, condenser, when, a, power, level, of, 200, mw, was, reattained, preparation, for, the, experiment, continued, although, the, power, level, was, much, lower, than, the, prescribed, 700, mw, as, part, of, the, test, two, additional, main, circulating, pumps, were, activated, at, 01, 05, the, increased, coolant, flow, lowered, the, overall, core, temperature, and, reduced, the, existing, steam, voids, in, the, core, because, water, absorbs, neutrons, better, than, steam, the, neutron, flux, and, reactivity, decreased, the, operators, responded, by, removing, more, manual, control, rods, to, maintain, power, it, was, around, this, time, that, the, number, of, control, rods, inserted, in, the, reactor, fell, below, the, required, value, of, 15, this, was, not, apparent, to, the, operators, because, the, rbmk, did, not, have, any, instruments, capable, of, calculating, the, inserted, rod, worth, in, real, time, the, combined, effect, of, these, various, actions, was, an, extremely, unstable, reactor, configuration, nearly, all, of, the, 211, control, rods, had, been, extracted, and, excessively, high, coolant, flow, rates, meant, that, the, water, had, less, time, to, cool, between, trips, through, the, core, therefore, entering, the, reactor, very, close, to, the, boiling, point, unlike, other, light, water, reactor, designs, the, rbmk, design, at, that, time, had, a, positive, void, coefficient, of, reactivity, at, typical, fuel, burnup, levels, this, meant, that, the, formation, of, steam, bubbles, voids, from, boiling, cooling, water, intensified, the, nuclear, chain, reaction, owing, to, voids, having, lower, neutron, absorption, than, water, unknown, to, the, operators, the, void, coefficient, was, not, counterbalanced, by, other, reactivity, effects, in, the, given, operating, regime, meaning, that, any, increase, in, boiling, would, produce, more, steam, voids, which, further, intensified, the, chain, reaction, leading, to, a, positive, feedback, loop, given, this, characteristic, reactor, no, 4, was, now, at, risk, of, a, runaway, increase, in, its, core, power, with, nothing, to, restrain, it, the, reactor, was, now, very, sensitive, to, the, regenerative, effect, of, steam, voids, on, reactor, power, 3, 14, at, 01, 23, 04, the, test, began, four, of, the, eight, main, circulating, pumps, mcp, were, to, be, powered, by, voltage, from, the, coasting, turbine, while, the, remaining, four, pumps, received, electrical, power, from, the, grid, as, normal, the, steam, to, the, turbines, was, shut, off, beginning, a, run, down, of, the, turbine, generator, the, diesel, generators, started, and, sequentially, picked, up, loads, the, generators, were, to, have, completely, picked, up, the, mcps, power, needs, by, 01, 23, 43, as, the, momentum, of, the, turbine, generator, decreased, so, did, the, power, it, produced, for, the, pumps, the, water, flow, rate, decreased, leading, to, increased, formation, of, steam, voids, in, the, coolant, flowing, up, through, the, fuel, pressure, tubes, 8, at, 01, 23, 40, a, scram, emergency, shutdown, of, the, reactor, was, initiated, as, the, experiment, was, wrapping, up, the, scram, was, started, when, the, az, 5, button, of, the, reactor, emergency, protection, system, was, pressed, this, engaged, the, drive, mechanism, on, all, control, rods, to, fully, insert, them, including, the, manual, control, rods, that, had, been, withdrawn, earlier, the, personnel, had, intended, to, shut, down, using, the, az, 5, button, in, preparation, for, scheduled, maintenance, and, the, scram, preceded, the, sharp, increase, in, power, 13, however, the, reason, why, the, button, was, pressed, when, it, was, is, not, certain, as, only, the, deceased, akimov, and, toptunov, made, that, decision, though, the, atmosphere, in, the, control, room, was, calm, according, to, eyewitnesses, 85, the, rbmk, designers, claim, the, button, had, to, have, been, pressed, only, after, the, reactor, already, began, to, self, destruct, 578, when, the, az, 5, button, was, pressed, the, insertion, of, control, rods, into, the, reactor, core, began, the, control, rod, insertion, mechanism, moved, the, rods, at, 0, 4, metres, per, second, 1, 3, ft, s, so, that, the, rods, took, 18, to, 20, seconds, to, travel, the, full, height, of, the, core, about, 7, metres, 23, ft, a, bigger, problem, was, the, design, of, the, rbmk, control, rods, each, of, which, had, a, graphite, neutron, moderator, section, attached, to, its, end, to, boost, reactor, output, by, displacing, water, when, the, control, rod, section, had, been, fully, withdrawn, from, the, reactor, that, is, when, a, control, rod, was, at, maximum, extraction, a, neutron, moderating, graphite, extension, was, centered, in, the, core, with, 1, 25, metres, 4, 1, ft, columns, of, water, above, and, below, it, consequently, injecting, a, control, rod, downward, into, the, reactor, in, a, scram, initially, displaced, neutron, absorbing, water, in, the, lower, portion, of, the, reactor, with, neutron, moderating, graphite, thus, an, emergency, scram, could, initially, increase, the, reaction, rate, in, the, lower, part, of, the, core, 4, this, behaviour, was, discovered, when, the, initial, insertion, of, control, rods, in, another, rbmk, reactor, at, ignalina, nuclear, power, plant, in, 1983, induced, a, power, spike, procedural, countermeasures, were, not, implemented, in, response, to, ignalina, the, iaea, investigative, report, insag, 7, later, stated, apparently, there, was, a, widespread, view, that, the, conditions, under, which, the, positive, scram, effect, would, be, important, would, never, occur, however, they, did, appear, in, almost, every, detail, in, the, course, of, the, actions, leading, to, the, chernobyl, accident, 13, a, few, seconds, into, the, scram, a, power, spike, occurred, and, the, core, overheated, causing, some, of, the, fuel, rods, to, fracture, some, have, speculated, that, this, also, blocked, the, control, rod, columns, jamming, them, at, one, third, insertion, within, three, seconds, the, reactor, output, rose, above, 530, mw, 31, instruments, did, not, register, the, subsequent, course, of, events, it, was, reconstructed, through, mathematical, simulation, the, power, spike, would, have, caused, an, increase, in, fuel, temperature, and, steam, buildup, leading, to, a, rapid, increase, in, steam, pressure, this, caused, the, fuel, cladding, to, fail, releasing, the, fuel, elements, into, the, coolant, and, rupturing, the, channels, in, which, these, elements, were, located, as, the, scram, continued, the, reactor, output, jumped, to, around, 30, 000, mw, thermal, 10, times, its, normal, operational, output, the, indicated, last, reading, on, the, control, panel, some, estimate, the, power, spike, may, have, gone, 10, times, higher, than, that, it, was, not, possible, to, reconstruct, the, precise, sequence, of, the, processes, that, led, to, the, destruction, of, the, reactor, and, the, power, unit, building, but, a, steam, explosion, appears, to, have, been, the, next, event, there, is, a, general, understanding, that, it, was, explosive, steam, pressure, from, the, damaged, fuel, channels, escaping, into, the, reactor, s, exterior, cooling, structure, that, caused, the, explosion, that, destroyed, the, reactor, casing, tearing, off, and, blasting, the, upper, plate, called, the, upper, biological, shield, to, which, the, entire, reactor, assembly, is, fastened, through, the, roof, of, the, reactor, building, this, is, believed, to, be, the, first, explosion, that, many, heard, 366, this, explosion, ruptured, further, fuel, channels, as, well, as, severing, most, of, the, coolant, lines, feeding, the, reactor, chamber, as, a, result, the, remaining, coolant, flashed, to, steam, and, escaped, the, reactor, core, the, total, water, loss, combined, with, a, high, positive, void, coefficient, further, increased, the, reactor, s, thermal, power, a, second, more, powerful, explosion, occurred, about, two, or, three, seconds, after, the, first, this, explosion, dispersed, the, damaged, core, and, effectively, terminated, the, nuclear, chain, reaction, this, explosion, compromised, more, of, the, reactor, containment, vessel, and, ejected, hot, lumps, of, graphite, moderator, the, ejected, graphite, and, the, demolished, channels, still, in, the, remains, of, the, reactor, vessel, caught, fire, on, exposure, to, air, significantly, contributing, to, the, spread, of, radioactive, fallout, the, explosion, is, estimated, to, have, had, the, power, equivalent, of, 225, tons, of, tnt, according, to, observers, outside, unit, 4, burning, lumps, of, material, and, sparks, shot, into, the, air, above, the, reactor, some, of, them, fell, onto, the, roof, of, the, machine, hall, and, started, a, fire, about, 25, of, the, red, hot, graphite, blocks, and, overheated, material, from, the, fuel, channels, was, ejected, parts, of, the, graphite, blocks, and, fuel, channels, were, out, of, the, reactor, building, as, a, result, of, the, damage, to, the, building, an, airflow, through, the, core, was, established, by, the, core, s, high, temperature, the, air, ignited, the, hot, graphite, and, started, a, graphite, fire, 32, after, the, larger, explosion, several, employees, at, the, power, station, went, outside, to, get, a, clearer, view, of, the, extent, of, the, damage, one, such, survivor, alexander, yuvchenko, said, that, once, he, stepped, out, and, looked, up, towards, the, reactor, hall, he, saw, a, very, beautiful, laser, like, beam, of, blue, light, caused, by, the, ionized, air, glow, that, appeared, to, be, flooding, up, into, infinity, there, were, initially, several, hypotheses, about, the, nature, of, the, second, larger, explosion, one, view, was, that, the, second, explosion, was, caused, by, the, combustion, of, hydrogen, which, had, been, produced, either, by, the, overheated, steam, zirconium, reaction, or, by, the, reaction, of, red, hot, graphite, with, steam, that, produced, hydrogen, and, carbon, monoxide, another, hypothesis, by, konstantin, checherov, published, in, 1998, was, that, the, second, explosion, was, a, thermal, explosion, of, the, reactor, due, to, the, uncontrollable, escape, of, fast, neutrons, caused, by, the, complete, water, loss, in, the, reactor, core, the, force, of, the, second, explosion, and, the, ratio, of, xenon, radioisotopes, released, after, the, accident, led, sergei, a, pakhomov, and, yuri, v, dubasov, in, 2009, to, theorize, that, the, second, explosion, could, have, been, an, extremely, fast, nuclear, power, transient, resulting, from, core, material, melting, in, the, absence, of, its, water, coolant, and, moderator, pakhomov, and, dubasov, argued, that, there, was, no, delayed, supercritical, increase, in, power, but, a, runaway, prompt, criticality, similar, to, the, explosion, of, a, fizzled, nuclear, weapon, their, evidence, came, from, cherepovets, a, city, 1, 000, kilometres, 620, mi, northeast, of, chernobyl, where, physicists, from, the, v, g, khlopin, radium, institute, measured, anomalous, high, levels, of, xenon, 135, a, short, half, life, isotope, four, days, after, the, explosion, this, meant, that, a, nuclear, event, in, the, reactor, may, have, ejected, xenon, to, higher, altitudes, in, the, atmosphere, than, the, later, fire, did, allowing, widespread, movement, of, xenon, to, remote, locations, this, was, an, alternative, to, the, more, accepted, explanation, of, a, positive, feedback, power, excursion, where, the, reactor, disassembled, itself, by, steam, explosion, the, energy, released, by, the, second, explosion, which, produced, the, majority, of, the, damage, was, estimated, by, pakhomov, and, dubasov, to, be, at, 40, billion, joules, the, equivalent, of, about, 10, tons, of, tnt, pakhomov, and, dubasov, s, nuclear, fizzle, hypothesis, was, examined, in, 2017, by, lars, erik, de, geer, christer, persson, and, henning, rodhe, who, put, the, hypothesized, fizzle, event, as, the, more, probable, cause, of, the, first, explosion, 11, both, analyses, argue, that, the, nuclear, fizzle, event, whether, producing, the, second, or, first, explosion, consisted, of, a, prompt, chain, reaction, that, was, limited, to, a, small, portion, of, the, reactor, core, since, self, disassembly, occurs, rapidly, in, fizzle, events, contrary, to, safety, regulations, bitumen, a, combustible, material, had, been, used, in, the, construction, of, the, roof, of, the, reactor, building, and, the, turbine, hall, ejected, material, ignited, at, least, five, fires, on, the, roof, of, the, adjacent, reactor, no, 3, which, was, still, operating, it, was, imperative, to, put, out, those, fires, and, protect, the, cooling, systems, of, reactor, no, 3, 42, inside, reactor, no, 3, the, chief, of, the, night, shift, yuri, bagdasarov, wanted, to, shut, down, the, reactor, immediately, but, chief, engineer, nikolai, fomin, would, not, allow, this, the, operators, were, given, respirators, and, potassium, iodide, tablets, and, told, to, continue, working, at, 05, 00, bagdasarov, made, his, own, decision, to, shut, down, the, reactor, 44, which, was, confirmed, in, writing, by, dyatlov, and, station, shift, supervisor, rogozhkin, shortly, after, the, accident, firefighters, arrived, to, try, to, extinguish, the, fires, first, on, the, scene, was, a, chernobyl, power, station, firefighter, brigade, under, the, command, of, lieutenant, volodymyr, pravyk, who, died, on, 11, may, 1986, of, acute, radiation, sickness, they, were, not, told, how, dangerously, radioactive, the, smoke, and, the, debris, were, and, may, not, even, have, known, that, the, accident, was, anything, more, than, a, regular, electrical, fire, we, didn, t, know, it, was, the, reactor, no, one, had, told, us, grigorii, khmel, the, driver, of, one, of, the, fire, engines, later, described, what, happened, we, arrived, there, at, 10, or, 15, minutes, to, two, in, the, morning, we, saw, graphite, scattered, about, misha, asked, is, that, graphite, i, kicked, it, away, but, one, of, the, fighters, on, the, other, truck, picked, it, up, it, s, hot, he, said, the, pieces, of, graphite, were, of, different, sizes, some, big, some, small, enough, to, pick, them, up, we, didn, t, know, much, about, radiation, even, those, who, worked, there, had, no, idea, there, was, no, water, left, in, the, trucks, misha, filled, a, cistern, and, we, aimed, the, water, at, the, top, then, those, boys, who, died, went, up, to, the, roof, vashchik, kolya, and, others, and, volodya, pravik, they, went, up, the, ladder, and, i, never, saw, them, again, anatoli, zakharov, a, fireman, stationed, in, chernobyl, offered, a, different, description, in, 2008, i, remember, joking, to, the, others, there, must, be, an, incredible, amount, of, radiation, here, we, ll, be, lucky, if, we, re, all, still, alive, in, the, morning, he, also, stated, of, course, we, knew, if, we, d, followed, regulations, we, would, never, have, gone, near, the, reactor, but, it, was, a, moral, obligation, our, duty, we, were, like, kamikaze, the, immediate, priority, was, to, extinguish, fires, on, the, roof, of, the, station, and, the, area, around, the, building, containing, reactor, no, 4, to, protect, no, 3, the, fires, were, extinguished, by, 5, 00, but, many, firefighters, received, high, doses, of, radiation, the, fire, inside, reactor, no, 4, continued, to, burn, until, 10, may, 1986, it, is, possible, that, well, over, half, of, the, graphite, burned, out, 73, it, was, thought, by, some, that, the, core, fire, was, extinguished, by, a, combined, effort, of, helicopters, dropping, more, than, 5, 000, tonnes, 11, million, pounds, of, sand, lead, clay, and, neutron, absorbing, boron, onto, the, burning, reactor, it, is, now, known, that, virtually, none, of, these, materials, reached, the, core, historians, estimate, that, about, 600, soviet, pilots, risked, dangerous, levels, of, radiation, to, fly, the, thousands, of, flights, needed, to, cover, reactor, no, 4, in, this, attempt, to, seal, off, radiation, from, eyewitness, accounts, of, the, firefighters, involved, before, they, died, one, described, his, experience, of, the, radiation, as, tasting, like, metal, and, feeling, a, sensation, similar, to, pins, and, needles, all, over, his, face, this, is, consistent, with, the, description, given, by, louis, slotin, a, manhattan, project, physicist, who, died, days, after, a, fatal, radiation, overdose, from, a, criticality, accident, the, explosion, and, fire, threw, hot, particles, of, the, nuclear, fuel, and, more, dangerous, fission, products, into, the, air, the, residents, of, the, surrounding, area, observed, the, radioactive, cloud, on, the, night, of, the, explosion, the, ionizing, radiation, levels, in, the, worst, hit, areas, of, the, reactor, building, have, been, estimated, to, be, 5, 6, roentgens, per, second, r, s, equivalent, to, more, than, 20, 000, roentgens, per, hour, a, lethal, dose, is, around, 500, roentgens, 5, gray, gy, in, modern, radiation, units, over, five, hours, in, some, areas, unprotected, workers, received, fatal, doses, in, less, than, a, minute, unfortunately, a, dosimeter, capable, of, measuring, up, to, 1, 000, r, s, was, buried, in, the, rubble, of, a, collapsed, part, of, the, building, and, another, one, failed, when, turned, on, most, remaining, dosimeters, had, limits, of, 0, 001, r, s, and, therefore, read, off, scale, the, reactor, crew, could, ascertain, only, that, the, radiation, levels, were, somewhere, above, 0, 001, r, s, 3, 6, r, h, while, the, true, levels, were, vastly, higher, in, some, areas, 42, 50, because, of, the, inaccurate, low, readings, the, reactor, crew, chief, aleksandr, akimov, assumed, that, the, reactor, was, intact, the, evidence, of, pieces, of, graphite, and, reactor, fuel, lying, around, the, building, was, ignored, and, the, readings, of, another, dosimeter, brought, in, by, 04, 30, were, dismissed, under, the, assumption, that, the, new, dosimeter, must, have, been, defective, 42, 50, akimov, stayed, in, the, reactor, building, until, morning, sending, members, of, his, crew, to, try, to, pump, water, into, the, reactor, none, of, them, wore, any, protective, gear, most, including, akimov, died, from, radiation, exposure, within, three, weeks, 247, 248, the, iaea, had, created, the, international, nuclear, safety, advisory, group, insag, in, 1985, insag, produced, two, significant, reports, on, chernobyl, insag, 1, in, 1986, and, a, revised, report, insag, 7, in, 1992, according, to, insag, 1, the, main, cause, of, the, accident, was, the, operators, actions, but, according, to, insag, 7, the, main, cause, was, the, reactor, s, design, 24, both, reports, identified, an, inadequate, safety, culture, insag, 1, coined, the, term, at, all, managerial, and, operational, levels, as, a, major, underlying, factor, 21, 24, the, nearby, city, of, pripyat, was, not, immediately, evacuated, and, the, townspeople, were, not, alerted, during, the, night, to, what, had, just, happened, however, within, a, few, hours, dozens, of, people, fell, ill, later, they, reported, severe, headaches, and, metallic, tastes, in, their, mouths, along, with, uncontrollable, fits, of, coughing, and, vomiting, as, the, plant, was, run, by, authorities, in, moscow, the, government, of, ukraine, did, not, receive, prompt, information, on, the, accident, valentyna, shevchenko, then, chairwoman, of, the, presidium, of, verkhovna, rada, of, the, ukrainian, ssr, said, that, ukraine, s, acting, minister, of, internal, affairs, vasyl, durdynets, phoned, her, at, work, at, 09, 00, to, report, current, affairs, only, at, the, end, of, the, conversation, did, he, add, that, there, had, been, a, fire, at, the, chernobyl, nuclear, power, plant, but, it, was, extinguished, and, everything, was, fine, when, shevchenko, asked, how, are, the, people, he, replied, that, there, was, nothing, to, be, concerned, about, some, are, celebrating, a, wedding, others, are, gardening, and, others, are, fishing, in, the, pripyat, river, shevchenko, then, spoke, by, telephone, to, volodymyr, shcherbytsky, general, secretary, of, the, communist, party, of, ukraine, and, de, facto, head, of, state, who, said, he, anticipated, a, delegation, of, the, state, commission, headed, by, boris, shcherbina, the, deputy, chairman, of, the, council, of, ministers, of, the, ussr, a, commission, was, established, later, in, the, day, to, investigate, the, accident, it, was, headed, by, valery, legasov, first, deputy, director, of, the, kurchatov, institute, of, atomic, energy, and, included, leading, nuclear, specialist, evgeny, velikhov, hydro, meteorologist, yuri, izrael, radiologist, leonid, ilyin, and, others, they, flew, to, boryspil, international, airport, and, arrived, at, the, power, plant, in, the, evening, of, 26, april, by, that, time, two, people, had, already, died, and, 52, were, hospitalized, the, delegation, soon, had, ample, evidence, that, the, reactor, was, destroyed, and, extremely, high, levels, of, radiation, had, caused, a, number, of, cases, of, radiation, exposure, in, the, early, daylight, hours, of, 27, april, they, ordered, the, evacuation, of, pripyat, a, translated, excerpt, of, the, evacuation, announcement, follows, for, the, attention, of, the, residents, of, pripyat, the, city, council, informs, you, that, due, to, the, accident, at, chernobyl, power, station, in, the, city, of, pripyat, the, radioactive, conditions, in, the, vicinity, are, deteriorating, the, communist, party, its, officials, and, the, armed, forces, are, taking, necessary, steps, to, combat, this, nevertheless, with, the, view, to, keep, people, as, safe, and, healthy, as, possible, the, children, being, top, priority, we, need, to, temporarily, evacuate, the, citizens, in, the, nearest, towns, of, kiev, region, for, these, reasons, starting, from, 27, april, 1986, 14, 00, each, apartment, block, will, be, able, to, have, a, bus, at, its, disposal, supervised, by, the, police, and, the, city, officials, it, is, highly, advisable, to, take, your, documents, some, vital, personal, belongings, and, a, certain, amount, of, food, just, in, case, with, you, the, senior, executives, of, public, and, industrial, facilities, of, the, city, has, decided, on, the, list, of, employees, needed, to, stay, in, pripyat, to, maintain, these, facilities, in, a, good, working, order, all, the, houses, will, be, guarded, by, the, police, during, the, evacuation, period, comrades, leaving, your, residences, temporarily, please, make, sure, you, have, turned, off, the, lights, electrical, equipment, and, water, and, shut, the, windows, please, keep, calm, and, orderly, in, the, process, of, this, short, term, evacuation, to, expedite, the, evacuation, residents, were, told, to, bring, only, what, was, necessary, and, that, they, would, remain, evacuated, for, approximately, three, days, as, a, result, most, personal, belongings, were, left, behind, and, residents, were, only, allowed, to, recover, certain, items, after, months, had, passed, by, 15, 00, 53, 000, people, were, evacuated, to, the, kiev, region, the, next, day, talks, began, for, evacuating, people, from, the, 10, kilometre, 6, 2, mi, zone, ten, days, after, the, accident, the, evacuation, area, was, expanded, to, 30, kilometres, 19, mi, 115, 120, 121, the, chernobyl, nuclear, power, plant, exclusion, zone, has, remained, ever, since, although, its, shape, has, changed, and, its, size, has, been, expanded, the, surveying, and, detection, of, isolated, fallout, hotspots, outside, this, zone, over, the, following, year, eventually, resulted, in, 135, 000, long, term, evacuees, in, total, the, years, between, 1986, and, 2000, saw, the, near, tripling, in, the, total, number, of, permanently, resettled, persons, from, the, most, severely, contaminated, areas, to, approximately, 350, 000, evacuation, began, one, and, a, half, days, before, the, accident, was, publicly, acknowledged, by, the, soviet, union, in, the, morning, of, 28, april, radiation, levels, set, off, alarms, at, the, forsmark, nuclear, power, plant, in, sweden, over, 1, 000, kilometres, 620, mi, from, the, chernobyl, plant, workers, at, forsmark, reported, the, case, to, the, swedish, radiation, safety, authority, which, determined, that, the, radiation, had, originated, elsewhere, that, day, the, swedish, government, contacted, the, soviet, government, to, inquire, about, whether, there, had, been, a, nuclear, accident, in, the, soviet, union, the, soviets, initially, denied, it, it, was, only, after, the, swedish, government, suggested, they, were, about, to, file, an, official, alert, with, the, international, atomic, energy, agency, that, the, soviet, government, admitted, that, an, accident, had, taken, place, at, chernobyl, at, first, the, soviets, only, conceded, that, a, minor, accident, had, occurred, but, once, they, began, evacuating, more, than, 100, 000, people, the, full, scale, of, the, situation, was, realized, by, the, global, community, at, 21, 02, the, evening, of, 28, april, a, 20, second, announcement, was, read, in, the, tv, news, programme, vremya, there, has, been, an, accident, at, the, chernobyl, nuclear, power, plant, one, of, the, nuclear, reactors, was, damaged, the, effects, of, the, accident, are, being, remedied, assistance, has, been, provided, for, any, affected, people, an, investigative, commission, has, been, set, up, this, was, the, first, time, the, soviet, union, officially, announced, a, nuclear, accident, the, telegraph, agency, of, the, soviet, union, tass, then, discussed, the, three, mile, island, accident, and, other, american, nuclear, accidents, which, serge, schmemann, of, the, new, york, times, wrote, was, an, example, of, the, common, soviet, tactic, of, whataboutism, the, mention, of, a, commission, also, indicated, to, observers, the, seriousness, of, the, incident, and, subsequent, state, radio, broadcasts, were, replaced, with, classical, music, which, was, a, common, method, of, preparing, the, public, for, an, announcement, of, a, tragedy, in, the, ussr, around, the, same, time, abc, news, released, its, report, about, the, disaster, shevchenko, was, the, first, of, the, ukrainian, state, top, officials, to, arrive, at, the, disaster, site, early, on, 28, april, she, returned, home, near, midnight, stopping, at, a, radiological, checkpoint, in, vilcha, one, of, the, first, that, were, set, up, soon, after, the, accident, there, was, a, notification, from, moscow, that, there, was, no, reason, to, postpone, the, 1, may, international, workers, day, celebrations, in, kiev, on, 30, april, a, meeting, of, the, political, bureau, of, the, central, committee, of, the, cpsu, took, place, to, discuss, the, plan, for, the, celebration, scientists, were, reporting, that, the, radiological, background, level, in, kiev, was, normal, it, was, decided, to, shorten, celebrations, from, the, regular, three, and, a, half, to, four, hours, to, under, two, hours, several, buildings, in, pripyat, were, kept, open, to, be, used, by, workers, still, involved, with, the, plant, these, included, the, jupiter, factory, and, the, azure, swimming, pool, used, by, the, chernobyl, liquidators, for, recreation, during, the, clean, up, two, floors, of, bubbler, pools, beneath, the, reactor, served, as, a, large, water, reservoir, for, the, emergency, cooling, pumps, and, as, a, pressure, suppression, system, capable, of, condensing, steam, in, case, of, a, small, broken, steam, pipe, the, third, floor, above, them, below, the, reactor, served, as, a, steam, tunnel, the, steam, released, by, a, broken, pipe, was, supposed, to, enter, the, steam, tunnel, and, be, led, into, the, pools, to, bubble, through, a, layer, of, water, after, the, disaster, the, pools, and, the, basement, were, flooded, because, of, ruptured, cooling, water, pipes, and, accumulated, firefighting, water, the, smoldering, graphite, fuel, and, other, material, at, more, than, 1, 200, c, 2, 190, f, started, to, burn, through, the, reactor, floor, and, mixed, with, molten, concrete, from, the, reactor, lining, creating, corium, a, radioactive, semi, liquid, material, comparable, to, lava, it, was, feared, that, if, this, mixture, melted, through, the, floor, into, the, pool, of, water, the, resulting, steam, production, would, further, contaminate, the, area, or, even, cause, another, explosion, ejecting, more, radioactive, material, it, became, necessary, to, drain, the, pool, these, fears, ultimately, proved, unfounded, since, corium, began, dripping, harmlessly, into, the, flooded, bubbler, pools, before, the, water, could, be, removed, the, molten, fuel, hit, the, water, and, cooled, into, a, light, brown, ceramic, pumice, whose, low, density, allowed, it, to, float, on, the, water, s, surface, unaware, of, this, the, government, commission, directed, that, the, bubbler, pools, be, drained, by, opening, its, sluice, gates, the, valves, controlling, it, however, were, located, in, a, flooded, corridor, in, a, subterranean, annex, adjacent, to, the, reactor, building, volunteers, in, diving, suits, and, respirators, and, equipped, with, dosimeters, entered, the, knee, deep, radioactive, water, and, opened, the, valves, these, were, the, engineers, oleksiy, ananenko, and, valeri, bezpalov, accompanied, by, the, shift, supervisor, boris, baranov, numerous, media, reports, falsely, suggested, that, all, three, men, died, just, days, later, in, fact, all, three, survived, and, were, awarded, the, order, for, courage, in, may, 2018, once, the, bubbler, pool, gates, were, opened, fire, brigade, pumps, were, then, used, to, drain, the, basement, the, operation, was, not, completed, until, 8, may, after, 20, 000, tonnes, 20, 000, long, tons, 22, 000, short, tons, of, water, were, pumped, out, the, government, commission, was, concerned, that, the, molten, core, would, burn, into, the, earth, and, contaminate, groundwater, to, reduce, the, likelihood, of, this, it, was, decided, to, freeze, the, earth, beneath, the, reactor, which, would, also, stabilize, the, foundations, using, oil, well, drilling, equipment, injection, of, liquid, nitrogen, began, on, 4, may, it, was, estimated, that, 25, tonnes, 55, thousand, pounds, of, liquid, nitrogen, per, day, would, be, required, to, keep, the, soil, frozen, at, 100, c, 148, f, 59, this, idea, was, quickly, scrapped, as, an, alternative, subway, builders, and, coal, miners, were, deployed, to, excavate, a, tunnel, below, the, reactor, to, make, room, for, a, cooling, system, the, final, makeshift, design, for, the, cooling, system, was, to, incorporate, a, coiled, formation, of, pipes, cooled, with, water, and, covered, on, top, with, a, thin, thermally, conductive, graphite, layer, the, graphite, layer, would, prevent, the, concrete, above, from, melting, this, graphite, cooling, plate, layer, was, to, be, encapsulated, between, two, concrete, layers, each, 1, metre, 3, ft, 3, in, thick, for, stabilisation, this, graphite, concrete, sandwich, would, be, similar, in, concept, to, later, core, catchers, now, part, of, many, nuclear, reactor, designs, the, graphite, cooling, plate, and, the, prior, nitrogen, injection, proposal, were, not, used, following, the, drop, in, aerial, temperatures, and, indicative, reports, that, the, fuel, melt, had, stopped, it, was, later, determined, that, the, fuel, had, flowed, three, floors, with, a, few, cubic, meters, coming, to, rest, at, ground, level, the, precautionary, underground, channel, with, its, active, cooling, was, deemed, redundant, and, the, excavation, was, filled, with, concrete, to, strengthen, the, foundation, below, the, reactor, in, the, months, after, the, explosion, attention, turned, to, removing, the, radioactive, debris, from, the, roof, while, the, worst, of, the, radioactive, debris, had, remained, inside, what, was, left, of, the, reactor, an, estimated, 100, tons, of, debris, on, that, roof, had, to, be, removed, to, enable, the, safe, construction, of, the, sarcophagus, a, concrete, structure, that, would, entomb, the, reactor, and, reduce, radioactive, dust, being, released, the, initial, plan, was, to, use, robots, to, clear, the, roof, the, soviets, used, approximately, 60, remote, controlled, robots, most, of, them, built, in, the, soviet, union, many, failed, due, to, the, difficult, terrain, combined, with, the, effect, of, high, radiation, fields, on, their, batteries, and, electronic, controls, in, 1987, valery, legasov, first, deputy, director, of, the, kurchatov, institute, of, atomic, energy, in, moscow, said, we, learned, that, robots, are, not, the, great, remedy, for, everything, where, there, was, very, high, radiation, the, robot, ceased, to, be, a, robot, the, electronics, quit, working, consequently, the, most, highly, radioactive, materials, were, shoveled, by, chernobyl, liquidators, from, the, military, wearing, protective, gear, dubbed, bio, robots, these, soldiers, could, only, spend, a, maximum, of, 40, 90, seconds, working, on, the, rooftops, of, the, surrounding, buildings, because, of, the, extremely, high, radiation, levels, only, 10, of, the, debris, cleared, from, the, roof, was, performed, by, robots, the, other, 90, was, removed, by, 3, 828, men, who, absorbed, on, average, an, estimated, dose, of, 25, rem, 250, msv, of, radiation, each, with, the, extinguishing, of, the, open, air, reactor, fire, the, next, step, was, to, prevent, the, spread, of, contamination, due, to, wind, or, birds, which, could, land, within, the, wreckage, and, then, carry, contamination, elsewhere, in, addition, rainwater, could, wash, contamination, into, the, sub, surface, water, table, where, it, could, migrate, outside, the, site, area, rainwater, falling, on, the, wreckage, could, also, accelerate, corrosion, of, steelwork, in, the, remaining, reactor, structure, a, further, challenge, was, to, reduce, the, large, amount, of, emitted, gamma, radiation, which, was, a, hazard, to, the, workforce, operating, the, adjacent, reactor, no, 3, the, solution, chosen, was, to, enclose, the, wrecked, reactor, by, the, construction, of, a, huge, composite, steel, and, concrete, shelter, which, became, known, as, the, sarcophagus, it, had, to, be, erected, quickly, and, within, the, constraints, of, high, levels, of, ambient, gamma, radiation, the, design, started, on, 20, may, 1986, 24, days, after, the, disaster, and, construction, was, from, june, to, late, november, the, construction, workers, had, to, be, protected, from, radiation, and, techniques, such, as, crane, drivers, working, from, lead, lined, control, cabins, were, employed, the, construction, work, included, erecting, walls, around, the, perimeter, clearing, and, surface, concreting, the, surrounding, ground, to, remove, sources, of, radiation, and, to, allow, access, for, large, construction, machinery, constructing, a, thick, radiation, shielding, wall, to, protect, the, workers, in, reactor, no, 3, fabricating, a, high, rise, buttress, to, strengthen, parts, of, the, old, structure, constructing, an, overall, roof, and, provisioning, a, ventilation, extract, system, to, capture, any, airborne, contamination, within, the, shelter, during, the, construction, of, the, sarcophagus, a, scientific, team, as, part, of, an, investigation, dubbed, complex, expedition, re, entered, the, reactor, to, locate, and, contain, nuclear, fuel, to, prevent, another, explosion, these, scientists, manually, collected, cold, fuel, rods, but, great, heat, was, still, emanating, from, the, core, rates, of, radiation, in, different, parts, of, the, building, were, monitored, by, drilling, holes, into, the, reactor, and, inserting, long, metal, detector, tubes, the, scientists, were, exposed, to, high, levels, of, radiation, in, december, 1986, after, six, months, of, investigation, the, team, discovered, with, the, help, of, a, remote, camera, that, an, intensely, radioactive, mass, more, than, 2, metres, 6, ft, 7, in, wide, had, formed, in, the, basement, of, unit, four, the, mass, was, called, the, elephant, s, foot, for, its, wrinkled, appearance, it, was, composed, of, melted, sand, concrete, and, a, large, amount, of, nuclear, fuel, that, had, escaped, from, the, reactor, the, concrete, beneath, the, reactor, was, steaming, hot, and, was, breached, by, now, solidified, lava, and, spectacular, unknown, crystalline, forms, termed, chernobylite, it, was, concluded, that, there, was, no, further, risk, of, explosion, the, official, contaminated, zones, saw, a, massive, clean, up, effort, lasting, seven, months, 177, 183, the, official, reason, for, such, early, and, dangerous, decontamination, efforts, rather, than, allowing, time, for, natural, decay, was, that, the, land, must, be, repopulated, and, brought, back, into, cultivation, within, fifteen, months, 75, of, the, land, was, under, cultivation, even, though, only, a, third, of, the, evacuated, villages, were, resettled, defence, forces, must, have, done, much, of, the, work, yet, this, land, was, of, marginal, agricultural, value, according, to, david, marples, the, administration, wished, to, forestall, panic, regarding, nuclear, energy, and, even, to, restart, the, power, station, 78, 79, 87, 192, 193, helicopters, regularly, sprayed, large, areas, of, contaminated, land, with, barda, a, sticky, polymerizing, fluid, designed, to, entrap, radioactive, dust, although, a, number, of, radioactive, emergency, vehicles, were, buried, in, trenches, many, of, the, vehicles, used, by, the, liquidators, still, remained, as, of, 2018, parked, in, a, field, in, the, chernobyl, area, scavengers, have, removed, many, functioning, but, highly, radioactive, parts, a, unique, clean, up, medal, was, given, to, the, clean, up, workers, known, as, liquidators, liquidators, worked, under, deplorable, conditions, poorly, informed, and, with, poor, protection, many, if, not, most, of, them, exceeded, radiation, safety, limits, 177, 183, questions, arose, about, the, future, of, the, plant, and, its, fate, all, work, on, the, unfinished, reactors, no, 5, and, no, 6, was, halted, three, years, later, the, damaged, reactor, was, sealed, off, and, 200, cubic, meters, 260, cu, yd, of, concrete, was, placed, between, the, disaster, site, and, the, operational, buildings, the, ukrainian, government, allowed, the, three, remaining, reactors, to, continue, operating, because, of, an, energy, shortage, in, october, 1991, a, fire, occurred, in, the, turbine, building, of, reactor, no, 2, the, authorities, subsequently, declared, the, reactor, damaged, beyond, repair, and, it, was, taken, offline, reactor, no, 1, was, decommissioned, in, november, 1996, as, part, of, a, deal, between, the, ukrainian, government, and, international, organizations, such, as, the, iaea, to, end, operations, at, the, plant, on, 15, december, 2000, then, president, leonid, kuchma, personally, turned, off, reactor, no, 3, in, an, official, ceremony, shutting, down, the, entire, site, soon, after, the, accident, the, reactor, building, was, quickly, encased, by, a, mammoth, concrete, sarcophagus, crane, operators, worked, blindly, from, inside, lead, lined, cabins, taking, instructions, from, distant, radio, observers, while, gargantuan, sized, pieces, of, concrete, were, moved, to, the, site, on, custom, made, vehicles, the, purpose, of, the, sarcophagus, was, to, stop, any, further, release, of, radioactive, particles, into, the, atmosphere, isolate, the, exposed, core, from, the, weather, and, provide, safety, for, the, continued, operations, of, adjacent, reactors, one, through, three, the, concrete, sarcophagus, was, never, intended, to, last, very, long, with, a, lifespan, of, only, 30, years, on, 12, february, 2013, a, 600, m, 2, 6, 500, sq, ft, section, of, the, roof, of, the, turbine, building, collapsed, adjacent, to, the, sarcophagus, causing, a, new, release, of, radioactivity, and, temporary, evacuation, of, the, area, at, first, it, was, assumed, that, the, roof, collapsed, because, of, the, weight, of, snow, however, the, amount, of, snow, was, not, exceptional, and, the, report, of, a, ukrainian, fact, finding, panel, concluded, that, the, collapse, was, the, result, of, sloppy, repair, work, and, aging, of, the, structure, experts, warned, the, sarcophagus, itself, was, on, the, verge, of, collapse, in, 1997, the, international, chernobyl, shelter, fund, was, founded, to, design, and, build, a, more, permanent, cover, for, the, unstable, and, short, lived, sarcophagus, it, received, 864, million, from, international, donors, in, 2011, and, was, managed, by, the, european, bank, for, reconstruction, and, development, ebrd, the, new, shelter, was, named, the, new, safe, confinement, and, construction, began, in, 2010, it, is, a, metal, arch, 105, metres, 344, ft, high, and, spanning, 257, metres, 843, ft, built, on, rails, adjacent, to, the, reactor, no, 4, building, so, that, it, could, be, slid, over, the, top, of, the, existing, sarcophagus, the, new, safe, confinement, was, completed, in, 2016, and, slid, into, place, over, the, sarcophagus, on, 29, november, unlike, the, original, sarcophagus, the, new, safe, confinement, is, designed, to, allow, the, reactor, to, be, safely, dismantled, using, remotely, operated, equipment, used, fuel, from, units, 1, 3, was, stored, in, the, units, cooling, ponds, and, in, an, interim, spent, fuel, storage, facility, pond, isf, 1, which, now, holds, most, of, the, spent, fuel, from, units, 1, 3, allowing, those, reactors, to, be, decommissioned, under, less, restrictive, conditions, approximately, 50, of, the, fuel, assemblies, from, units, 1, and, 2, were, damaged, and, required, special, handling, moving, fuel, to, isf, 1, was, thus, carried, out, in, three, stages, fuel, from, unit, 3, was, moved, first, then, all, undamaged, fuel, from, units, 1, and, 2, and, finally, the, damaged, fuel, from, units, 1, and, 2, fuel, transfers, to, isf, 1, were, completed, in, june, 2016, a, need, for, larger, longer, term, radioactive, waste, management, at, the, site, is, to, be, fulfilled, by, a, new, facility, designated, isf, 2, this, facility, is, to, serve, as, dry, storage, for, used, fuel, assemblies, from, units, 1, 3, and, other, operational, wastes, as, well, as, material, from, decommissioning, units, 1, 3, a, contract, was, signed, in, 1999, with, areva, np, framatome, for, construction, of, isf, 2, in, 2003, after, a, significant, part, of, the, storage, structures, had, been, built, technical, deficiencies, in, the, design, concept, became, apparent, in, 2007, areva, withdrew, and, holtec, international, was, contracted, for, a, new, design, and, construction, of, isf, 2, the, new, design, was, approved, in, 2010, work, started, in, 2011, and, construction, was, completed, in, august, 2017, isf, 2, is, the, world, s, largest, nuclear, fuel, storage, facility, expected, to, hold, more, than, 21, 000, fuel, assemblies, for, at, least, 100, years, the, project, includes, a, processing, facility, able, to, cut, the, rbmk, fuel, assemblies, and, to, place, the, material, in, canisters, to, be, filled, with, inert, gas, and, welded, shut, the, canisters, are, then, to, be, transported, to, dry, storage, vaults, where, the, fuel, containers, will, be, enclosed, for, up, to, 100, years, expected, processing, capacity, is, 2, 500, fuel, assemblies, per, year, about, 95, of, the, fuel, in, reactor, no, 4, at, the, time, of, the, accident, the, radioactive, material, consists, of, core, fragments, dust, and, lava, like, fuel, containing, materials, fcm, also, called, corium, that, flowed, through, the, wrecked, reactor, building, before, hardening, into, a, ceramic, form, three, different, lavas, are, present, in, the, basement, of, the, reactor, building, black, brown, and, a, porous, ceramic, the, lava, materials, are, silicate, glasses, with, inclusions, of, other, materials, within, them, the, porous, lava, is, brown, lava, that, dropped, into, water, and, thus, cooled, rapidly, it, is, unclear, how, long, the, ceramic, form, will, retard, the, release, of, radioactivity, from, 1997, to, 2002, a, series, of, published, papers, suggested, that, the, self, irradiation, of, the, lava, would, convert, all, 1, 200, tonnes, 1, 200, long, tons, 1, 300, short, tons, into, a, submicrometre, and, mobile, powder, within, a, few, weeks, it, has, been, reported, that, the, degradation, of, the, lava, is, likely, to, be, a, slow, gradual, process, the, same, paper, states, that, the, loss, of, uranium, from, the, wrecked, reactor, is, only, 10, kg, 22, lb, per, year, this, low, rate, of, uranium, leaching, suggests, that, the, lava, is, resisting, its, environment, the, paper, also, states, that, when, the, shelter, is, improved, the, leaching, rate, of, the, lava, will, decrease, as, of, 2021, some, fuel, had, already, degraded, significantly, the, famous, elephant, s, foot, which, originally, was, so, hard, that, it, required, the, use, of, an, armor, piercing, ak, 47, round, to, remove, a, chunk, had, softened, to, a, texture, similar, to, sand, prior, to, the, completion, of, the, new, safe, confinement, building, rainwater, acted, as, a, neutron, moderator, triggering, increased, fission, in, the, remaining, materials, risking, criticality, gadolinium, nitrate, solution, was, used, to, quench, neutrons, to, slow, the, fission, even, after, completion, of, the, building, fission, reactions, may, be, increasing, scientists, are, working, to, understand, the, cause, and, risks, while, neutron, activity, has, declined, across, most, of, the, destroyed, fuel, from, 2017, until, late, 2020, a, doubling, in, neutron, density, was, recorded, in, the, sub, reactor, space, before, levelling, off, in, early, 2021, this, indicated, increasing, levels, of, fission, as, water, levels, dropped, the, opposite, of, what, had, been, expected, and, atypical, compared, to, other, fuel, containing, areas, the, fluctuations, have, led, to, fears, that, a, self, sustaining, reaction, could, be, created, which, would, likely, spread, more, radioactive, dust, and, debris, throughout, the, new, safe, confinement, making, future, cleanup, even, more, difficult, potential, solutions, include, using, a, robot, to, drill, into, the, fuel, and, insert, boron, carbide, control, rods, in, early, 2021, a, chnpp, press, release, stated, that, the, observed, increase, in, neutron, densities, had, leveled, off, since, the, beginning, of, that, year, the, exclusion, zone, was, originally, an, area, with, a, radius, of, 30, kilometres, 19, mi, in, all, directions, from, the, plant, but, was, subsequently, greatly, enlarged, to, include, an, area, measuring, approximately, 2, 600, km, 2, 1, 000, sq, mi, officially, called, the, zone, of, alienation, the, area, has, largely, reverted, to, forest, and, was, overrun, by, wildlife, due, to, the, lack, of, human, competition, for, space, and, resources, mass, media, sources, have, provided, generalized, estimates, for, when, the, zone, could, be, considered, habitable, again, these, informal, estimates, have, ranged, from, approximately, 300, years, to, multiples, of, 20, 000, years, referring, to, the, half, life, of, plutonium, 239, which, contaminates, the, central, portion, of, the, zone, in, the, years, following, the, disaster, residents, known, as, samosely, illegally, returned, to, their, abandoned, homes, most, people, are, retired, and, survive, mainly, from, farming, and, packages, delivered, by, visitors, as, of, 2016, 187, locals, had, returned, to, the, zone, and, were, living, permanently, there, in, 2011, ukraine, opened, the, sealed, zone, around, the, chernobyl, reactor, to, tourists, during, the, dry, season, forest, fires, are, a, perennial, concern, in, areas, contaminated, by, radioactive, material, dry, conditions, and, build, up, of, debris, make, the, forests, a, ripe, breeding, ground, for, wildfires, depending, on, prevailing, atmospheric, conditions, smoke, from, wildfires, could, potentially, spread, more, radioactive, material, outside, the, exclusion, zone, in, belarus, the, bellesrad, organization, is, tasked, with, overseeing, food, cultivation, and, forestry, management, in, the, area, in, april, 2020, forest, fires, spread, through, 20, 000, hectares, 49, 000, acres, of, the, exclusion, zone, causing, increased, radiation, from, the, release, of, caesium, 137, and, strontium, 90, from, the, ground, and, biomass, the, increase, in, radioactivity, was, detectable, by, the, monitoring, network, but, did, not, pose, a, threat, to, human, health, the, average, radiation, dose, that, kyiv, residents, received, as, a, result, of, the, fires, was, estimated, to, be, 1, nsv, the, chernobyl, trust, fund, was, created, in, 1991, by, the, united, nations, to, help, victims, of, the, chernobyl, accident, it, is, administered, by, the, united, nations, office, for, the, coordination, of, humanitarian, affairs, which, also, manages, strategy, formulation, resource, mobilization, and, advocacy, efforts, beginning, in, 2002, under, the, united, nations, development, programme, the, fund, shifted, its, focus, from, emergency, assistance, to, long, term, development, the, chernobyl, shelter, fund, was, established, in, 1997, at, the, g8, summit, in, denver, to, finance, the, shelter, implementation, plan, sip, the, plan, called, for, transforming, the, site, into, an, ecologically, safe, condition, through, stabilization, of, the, sarcophagus, and, construction, of, the, new, safe, confinement, structure, while, the, original, cost, estimate, for, the, sip, was, us, 768, million, the, 2006, estimate, was, 1, 2, billion, in, 2003, the, united, nations, development, programme, launched, the, chernobyl, recovery, and, development, programme, crdp, for, the, recovery, of, affected, areas, the, programme, was, initiated, in, february, 2002, based, on, the, recommendations, in, the, report, on, human, consequences, of, the, chernobyl, nuclear, accident, the, main, goal, of, the, crdp, was, supporting, the, government, of, ukraine, in, mitigating, long, term, social, economic, and, ecological, consequences, of, the, chernobyl, catastrophe, crdp, works, in, the, four, most, affected, ukrainian, areas, kyivska, zhytomyrska, chernihivska, and, rivnenska, more, than, 18, 000, ukrainian, children, affected, by, the, disaster, have, been, treated, in, the, resort, town, of, tarar, cuba, since, 1990, the, international, project, on, the, health, effects, of, the, chernobyl, accident, was, created, and, received, us, 20, million, mainly, from, japan, in, the, hope, of, discovering, the, main, cause, of, health, problems, due, to, iodine, 131, radiation, these, funds, were, divided, among, ukraine, belarus, and, russia, for, investigation, of, health, effects, as, there, was, significant, corruption, in, former, soviet, countries, most, foreign, aid, was, given, to, russia, and, no, results, from, the, funding, were, demonstrated, in, july, 2019, ukrainian, president, volodymyr, zelenskyy, announced, that, the, chernobyl, site, would, become, an, official, tourist, attraction, zelenskyy, said, we, must, give, this, territory, of, ukraine, a, new, life, after, chernobyl, saw, an, increase, in, visitors, since, the, hbo, mini, series, dr, t, steen, a, microbiology, and, immunology, teacher, at, georgetown, s, school, of, medicine, recommends, tourists, to, wear, clothes, and, shoes, they, are, comfortable, with, throwing, away, and, to, avoid, plant, life, although, it, is, difficult, to, compare, the, chernobyl, accident, with, a, deliberate, air, burst, nuclear, detonation, it, is, estimated, that, chernobyl, released, about, 400, times, more, radioactive, material, than, the, combined, atomic, bombings, of, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, however, the, chernobyl, disaster, released, only, about, one, hundredth, to, one, thousandth, of, the, total, radioactivity, released, during, nuclear, weapons, testing, at, the, height, of, the, cold, war, due, to, varying, isotope, abundances, approximately, 100, 000, square, kilometres, 39, 000, sq, mi, of, land, was, significantly, contaminated, with, the, worst, affected, areas, in, belarus, ukraine, and, russia, lower, contamination, levels, were, detected, across, europe, except, for, the, iberian, peninsula, on, 28, april, workers, at, the, forsmark, nuclear, power, plant, 1, 100, km, 680, mi, from, chernobyl, were, found, with, radioactive, particles, on, their, clothing, sweden, s, elevated, radioactivity, levels, detected, at, noon, on, 28, april, were, traced, back, to, the, western, soviet, union, meanwhile, finland, also, detected, rising, radiation, levels, but, a, civil, service, strike, delayed, the, response, and, publication, contamination, from, the, chernobyl, accident, was, scattered, irregularly, depending, on, weather, conditions, much, of, it, deposited, on, mountainous, regions, such, as, the, alps, the, welsh, mountains, and, the, scottish, highlands, where, adiabatic, cooling, caused, radioactive, rainfall, the, resulting, patches, of, contamination, were, often, highly, localized, and, localized, water, flows, contributed, to, large, variations, in, radioactivity, over, small, areas, sweden, and, norway, also, received, heavy, fallout, when, the, contaminated, air, collided, with, a, cold, front, bringing, rain, 43, 44, 78, there, was, also, groundwater, contamination, rain, was, deliberately, seeded, over, 10, 000, square, kilometres, 3, 900, sq, mi, of, belarus, by, the, soviet, air, force, to, remove, radioactive, particles, from, clouds, heading, toward, highly, populated, areas, heavy, black, coloured, rain, fell, on, the, city, of, gomel, reports, from, soviet, and, western, scientists, indicate, that, the, belarusian, ssr, received, about, 60, of, the, contamination, that, fell, on, the, former, soviet, union, however, the, 2006, torch, report, stated, that, up, to, half, of, the, volatile, particles, had, actually, landed, outside, the, former, ussr, area, currently, making, up, ukraine, belarus, and, russia, an, unconnected, large, area, in, russian, sfsr, south, of, bryansk, was, also, contaminated, as, were, parts, of, northwestern, ukrainian, ssr, studies, in, surrounding, countries, indicate, that, more, than, one, million, people, could, have, been, affected, by, radiation, 2016, data, from, a, long, term, monitoring, program, showed, a, decrease, in, internal, radiation, exposure, of, the, inhabitants, of, a, region, in, belarus, close, to, gomel, in, western, europe, precautionary, measures, taken, in, response, to, the, radiation, included, banning, the, importation, of, certain, foods, a, 2006, study, found, contamination, was, relatively, limited, diminishing, from, west, to, east, such, that, a, hunter, consuming, 40, kilograms, of, contaminated, wild, boar, in, 1997, would, be, exposed, to, about, one, millisievert, the, chernobyl, release, was, characterized, by, the, physical, and, chemical, properties, of, the, radio, isotopes, in, the, core, particularly, dangerous, were, the, highly, radioactive, fission, products, those, with, high, nuclear, decay, rates, that, accumulate, in, the, food, chain, such, as, some, of, the, isotopes, of, iodine, caesium, and, strontium, iodine, 131, was, and, caesium, 137, remains, the, two, most, responsible, for, the, radiation, exposure, received, by, the, general, population, at, different, times, after, the, accident, different, isotopes, were, responsible, for, the, majority, of, the, external, dose, the, remaining, quantity, of, any, radioisotope, and, therefore, the, activity, of, that, isotope, after, 7, decay, half, lives, have, passed, is, less, than, 1, of, its, initial, magnitude, and, it, continues, to, reduce, beyond, 0, 78, after, 7, half, lives, to, 0, 10, remaining, after, 10, half, lives, have, passed, and, so, on, some, radionuclides, have, decay, products, that, are, likewise, radioactive, which, is, not, accounted, for, here, the, release, of, radioisotopes, from, the, nuclear, fuel, was, largely, controlled, by, their, boiling, points, and, the, majority, of, the, radioactivity, present, in, the, core, was, retained, in, the, reactor, the, chernobyl, nuclear, power, plant, is, located, next, to, the, pripyat, river, which, feeds, into, the, dnieper, reservoir, system, one, of, the, largest, surface, water, systems, in, europe, which, at, the, time, supplied, water, to, kiev, s, 2, 4, million, residents, and, was, still, in, spring, flood, when, the, accident, occurred, 60, the, radioactive, contamination, of, aquatic, systems, therefore, became, a, major, problem, in, the, immediate, aftermath, in, the, most, affected, areas, of, ukraine, levels, of, radioactivity, in, drinking, water, caused, concern, during, the, weeks, and, months, after, the, accident, guidelines, for, levels, of, radioiodine, in, drinking, water, were, temporarily, raised, to, 3, 700, bq, l, allowing, most, water, to, be, reported, as, safe, officially, it, was, stated, that, all, contaminants, had, settled, to, the, bottom, in, an, insoluble, phase, and, would, not, dissolve, for, 800, 1000, years, 64, a, year, after, the, accident, it, was, announced, that, even, the, water, of, the, chernobyl, plant, s, cooling, pond, was, within, acceptable, norms, despite, this, two, months, after, the, disaster, the, kiev, water, supply, was, switched, from, the, dnieper, to, the, desna, river, 64, 65, meanwhile, massive, silt, traps, were, constructed, along, with, a, 30, metre, 98, ft, deep, underground, barrier, to, prevent, groundwater, from, the, destroyed, reactor, entering, the, pripyat, river, 65, 67, groundwater, was, not, badly, affected, by, the, chernobyl, accident, since, radionuclides, with, short, half, lives, decayed, away, long, before, they, could, affect, groundwater, supplies, and, longer, lived, radionuclides, such, as, radiocaesium, and, radiostrontium, were, adsorbed, to, surface, soils, before, they, could, transfer, to, groundwater, however, significant, transfers, of, radionuclides, to, groundwater, have, occurred, from, waste, disposal, sites, in, the, 30, km, 19, mi, exclusion, zone, around, chernobyl, although, there, is, a, potential, for, transfer, of, radionuclides, from, these, disposal, sites, off, site, the, iaea, chernobyl, report, argues, that, this, is, not, significant, in, comparison, to, washout, of, surface, deposited, radioactivity, bio, accumulation, of, radioactivity, in, fish, resulted, in, concentrations, significantly, above, guideline, maximum, levels, for, consumption, guideline, maximum, levels, for, radiocaesium, in, fish, vary, but, are, approximately, 1000, bq, kg, in, the, european, union, in, the, kiev, reservoir, in, ukraine, concentrations, in, fish, were, in, the, range, of, 3000, bq, kg, during, the, early, years, after, the, accident, in, small, closed, lakes, in, belarus, and, the, bryansk, region, of, russia, concentrations, in, a, number, of, fish, species, varied, from, 100, to, 60, 000, bq, kg, during, 1990, 1992, the, contamination, of, fish, caused, short, term, concern, in, parts, of, the, uk, and, germany, and, in, the, long, term, in, the, affected, areas, of, ukraine, belarus, and, russia, as, well, as, scandinavia, after, the, disaster, four, square, kilometres, 1, 5, sq, mi, of, pine, forest, directly, downwind, of, the, reactor, turned, reddish, brown, and, died, earning, the, name, red, forest, some, animals, in, the, worst, hit, areas, also, died, or, stopped, reproducing, most, domestic, animals, were, removed, from, the, exclusion, zone, but, horses, left, on, an, island, in, the, pripyat, river, 6, km, 4, mi, from, the, power, plant, died, when, their, thyroid, glands, were, destroyed, by, radiation, doses, of, 150, 200, sv, some, cattle, on, the, same, island, died, and, those, that, survived, were, stunted, the, next, generation, appeared, to, be, normal, the, mutation, rates, for, plants, and, animals, have, increased, by, a, factor, of, 20, because, of, the, release, of, radionuclides, from, chernobyl, there, is, evidence, for, elevated, mortality, rates, and, increased, rates, of, reproductive, failure, in, contaminated, areas, consistent, with, the, expected, frequency, of, deaths, due, to, mutations, on, farms, in, narodychi, raion, of, ukraine, it, is, claimed, that, from, 1986, to, 1990, nearly, 350, animals, were, born, with, gross, deformities, in, comparison, only, three, abnormal, births, had, been, registered, in, the, five, years, prior, subsequent, research, on, microorganisms, while, limited, suggests, that, in, the, aftermath, of, the, disaster, bacterial, and, viral, specimens, exposed, to, the, radiation, underwent, rapid, changes, activations, of, soil, micromycetes, have, been, reported, a, paper, in, 1998, reported, the, discovery, of, an, escherichia, coli, mutant, that, was, hyper, resistant, to, a, variety, of, dna, damaging, elements, including, x, ray, radiation, uv, c, and, 4, nitroquinoline, 1, oxide, 4nqo, cladosporium, sphaerospermum, a, species, of, fungus, that, has, thrived, in, the, chernobyl, contaminated, area, has, been, investigated, for, the, purpose, of, using, the, fungus, particular, melanin, to, protect, against, high, radiation, environments, such, as, space, travel, the, disaster, has, been, described, by, lawyers, academics, and, journalists, as, an, example, of, ecocide, with, radiocaesium, binding, less, with, humic, acid, peaty, soils, than, the, known, binding, fixation, that, occurs, on, kaolinite, rich, clay, soils, many, marshy, areas, of, ukraine, had, the, highest, soil, to, dairy, milk, transfer, coefficients, of, soil, activity, in, 200, kbq, m, 2, to, dairy, milk, activity, in, bq, l, that, had, ever, been, reported, with, the, transfer, from, initial, land, activity, into, milk, activity, ranging, from, 0, 3, 2, to, 20, 2, times, that, which, was, on, the, soil, in, 1987, soviet, medical, teams, conducted, some, 16, 000, whole, body, count, examinations, on, inhabitants, in, otherwise, comparatively, lightly, contaminated, regions, with, good, prospects, for, recovery, this, was, to, determine, the, effect, of, banning, local, food, and, using, only, food, imports, on, the, internal, body, burden, of, radionuclides, in, inhabitants, concurrent, agricultural, countermeasures, were, used, when, cultivation, did, occur, to, further, reduce, the, soil, to, human, transfer, as, much, as, possible, the, expected, highest, body, activity, was, in, the, first, few, years, where, the, unabated, ingestion, of, local, food, resulted, in, the, transfer, of, activity, from, soil, to, body, after, the, dissolution, of, the, soviet, union, the, now, reduced, scale, initiative, to, monitor, human, body, activity, in, these, regions, of, ukraine, recorded, a, small, and, gradual, half, decade, long, rise, in, internal, committed, dose, before, returning, to, the, previous, trend, of, observing, lower, body, counts, each, year, this, momentary, rise, is, hypothesized, to, be, due, to, the, cessation, of, the, soviet, food, imports, together, with, many, villagers, returning, to, older, dairy, food, cultivation, practices, and, large, increases, in, wild, berry, and, mushroom, foraging, in, a, 2007, paper, a, robot, sent, into, the, no, 4, reactor, returned, with, samples, of, black, melanin, rich, radiotrophic, fungi, that, grow, on, the, reactor, s, walls, of, the, 440, 350, wild, boar, killed, in, the, 2010, hunting, season, in, germany, approximately, one, thousand, were, contaminated, with, levels, of, radiation, above, the, permitted, limit, of, 600, becquerels, of, caesium, per, kilogram, of, dry, weight, due, to, residual, radioactivity, from, chernobyl, because, elaphomyces, fungal, species, bioaccumulate, radiocaesium, boars, of, the, bavarian, forest, that, consume, these, deer, truffles, are, contaminated, at, higher, levels, than, their, environment, s, soil, given, that, nuclear, weapons, release, a, higher, 135, c, 137, c, ratio, than, nuclear, reactors, the, high, 135, c, content, in, these, boars, suggests, that, their, radiological, contamination, can, be, largely, attributed, to, the, soviet, union, s, nuclear, weapons, testing, in, ukraine, which, peaked, during, the, late, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, in, 2015, long, term, empirical, data, showed, no, evidence, of, a, negative, influence, of, radiation, on, mammal, abundance, on, high, ground, such, as, mountain, ranges, there, is, increased, precipitation, due, to, adiabatic, cooling, this, resulted, in, localized, concentrations, of, contaminants, on, distant, areas, higher, in, bq, m, 2, values, to, many, lowland, areas, much, closer, to, the, source, of, the, plume, the, norwegian, agricultural, authority, reported, that, in, 2009, a, total, of, 18, 000, livestock, in, norway, required, uncontaminated, feed, for, a, period, before, slaughter, to, ensure, that, their, meat, had, an, activity, below, the, government, permitted, value, of, caesium, per, kilogram, deemed, suitable, for, human, consumption, this, contamination, was, due, to, residual, radioactivity, from, chernobyl, in, the, mountain, plants, they, graze, on, in, the, wild, during, the, summer, 1, 914, sheep, required, uncontaminated, feed, for, a, time, before, slaughter, during, 2012, with, these, sheep, located, in, only, 18, of, norway, s, municipalities, a, decrease, from, the, 35, municipalities, in, 2011, and, the, 117, municipalities, affected, during, 1986, the, after, effects, of, chernobyl, on, the, mountain, lamb, industry, in, norway, were, expected, to, be, seen, for, a, further, 100, years, although, the, severity, of, the, effects, would, decline, over, that, period, the, united, kingdom, restricted, the, movement, of, sheep, from, upland, areas, when, radioactive, caesium, 137, fell, across, parts, of, northern, ireland, wales, scotland, and, northern, england, in, the, immediate, aftermath, of, the, disaster, the, movement, of, a, total, of, 4, 225, 000, sheep, was, restricted, across, a, total, of, 9, 700, farms, to, prevent, contaminated, meat, entering, the, human, food, chain, the, number, of, sheep, and, farms, affected, has, decreased, since, 1986, northern, ireland, was, released, from, all, restrictions, in, 2000, and, by, 2009, 369, farms, containing, around, 190, 000, sheep, remained, under, the, restrictions, in, wales, cumbria, and, northern, scotland, the, restrictions, applying, in, scotland, were, lifted, in, 2010, while, those, applying, to, wales, and, cumbria, were, lifted, during, 2012, meaning, no, farms, in, the, uk, remain, restricted, because, of, chernobyl, the, legislation, used, to, control, sheep, movement, and, compensate, farmers, was, revoked, during, 2012, by, the, relevant, authorities, in, the, uk, the, only, known, causal, deaths, from, the, accident, involved, plant, workers, and, firefighters, the, reactor, explosion, killed, two, engineers, and, 28, others, died, within, three, months, from, acute, radiation, syndrome, ars, some, sources, report, a, total, initial, fatality, of, 31, including, one, additional, off, site, death, due, to, coronary, thrombosis, attributed, to, stress, most, serious, ars, cases, were, treated, with, the, assistance, of, american, specialist, robert, peter, gale, who, supervised, bone, marrow, transplant, procedures, although, these, were, unsuccessful, the, fatalities, were, largely, due, to, wearing, dusty, soaked, uniforms, causing, beta, burns, over, large, areas, of, skin, bacterial, infection, was, a, leading, cause, of, death, in, ars, patients, in, the, 10, years, following, the, accident, 14, more, people, who, had, been, initially, hospitalized, died, mostly, from, causes, unrelated, to, radiation, exposure, with, only, two, deaths, resulting, from, myelodysplastic, syndrome, scientific, consensus, supported, by, the, chernobyl, forum, suggests, no, statistically, significant, increase, in, solid, cancer, incidence, among, rescue, workers, however, childhood, thyroid, cancer, increased, with, about, 4, 000, new, cases, reported, by, 2002, in, contaminated, areas, of, belarus, russia, and, ukraine, largely, due, to, high, levels, of, radioactive, iodine, the, recovery, rate, is, 99, with, 15, terminal, cases, reported, no, increase, in, mutation, rates, was, found, among, children, of, liquidators, or, those, living, in, contaminated, areas, psychosomatic, illness, and, post, traumatic, stress, driven, by, widespread, fear, of, radiological, disease, have, had, a, significant, impact, often, exacerbating, health, issues, by, fostering, fatalistic, attitudes, and, harmful, behaviors, by, 2000, the, number, of, ukrainians, claiming, radiation, related, sufferer, status, reached, 3, 5, million, or, 5, of, the, population, many, of, whom, were, resettled, from, contaminated, zones, or, former, chernobyl, workers, 4, 5, increased, medical, surveillance, after, the, accident, led, to, higher, recorded, rates, of, benign, conditions, and, cancers, the, four, most, harmful, radionuclides, spread, from, chernobyl, were, iodine, 131, caesium, 134, caesium, 137, and, strontium, 90, with, half, lives, of, 8, days, 2, 07, years, 30, 2, years, and, 28, 8, years, respectively, 8, the, iodine, was, initially, viewed, with, less, alarm, than, the, other, isotopes, because, of, its, short, half, life, but, it, is, highly, volatile, and, appears, to, have, travelled, furthest, and, caused, the, most, severe, health, problems, 24, strontium, is, the, least, volatile, and, of, main, concern, in, the, areas, near, chernobyl, 8, iodine, tends, to, become, concentrated, in, thyroid, and, milk, glands, leading, among, other, things, to, increased, incidence, of, thyroid, cancers, the, total, ingested, dose, was, largely, from, iodine, and, unlike, the, other, fission, products, rapidly, found, its, way, from, dairy, farms, to, human, ingestion, similarly, in, dose, reconstruction, for, those, evacuated, at, different, times, and, from, various, towns, the, inhalation, dose, was, dominated, by, iodine, 40, along, with, airborne, tellurium, 20, and, oxides, of, rubidium, 20, both, as, equally, secondary, appreciable, contributors, long, term, hazards, such, as, caesium, tends, to, accumulate, in, vital, organs, such, as, the, heart, while, strontium, accumulates, in, bones, and, may, be, a, risk, to, bone, marrow, and, lymphocytes, 8, radiation, is, most, damaging, to, cells, that, are, actively, dividing, in, adult, mammals, cell, division, is, slow, except, in, hair, follicles, skin, bone, marrow, and, the, gastrointestinal, tract, which, is, why, vomiting, and, hair, loss, are, common, symptoms, of, acute, radiation, sickness, 42, the, mutation, rates, among, animals, in, the, chernobyl, zone, have, been, a, topic, of, ongoing, scientific, debate, notably, regarding, the, research, conducted, by, anders, moller, and, timothy, mousseau, their, research, which, suggests, higher, mutation, rates, among, wildlife, in, the, chernobyl, zone, has, been, met, with, criticism, over, the, reproducibility, of, their, findings, and, the, methodologies, used, in, 1996, geneticist, ronald, chesser, and, robert, baker, published, a, paper, on, the, thriving, vole, population, within, the, exclusion, zone, in, which, the, central, conclusion, was, essentially, that, the, mutation, rate, in, these, animals, is, hundreds, and, probably, thousands, of, times, greater, than, normal, this, claim, occurred, after, they, had, done, a, comparison, of, the, mitochondrial, dna, of, the, chernobyl, voles, with, that, of, a, control, group, of, voles, from, outside, the, region, the, authors, discovered, they, had, incorrectly, classified, the, species, of, vole, and, were, genetically, comparing, two, different, vole, species, they, issued, a, retraction, in, 1997, following, the, accident, journalists, encouraged, public, mistrust, of, medical, professionals, this, media, driven, framing, led, to, an, increase, in, induced, abortions, across, europe, out, of, fears, of, radiation, an, estimated, 150, 000, elective, abortions, were, performed, worldwide, due, to, radiophobia, the, statistical, data, excludes, soviet, ukraine, belarus, abortion, rates, which, are, unavailable, however, in, denmark, about, 400, additional, abortions, were, recorded, and, in, greece, an, increase, of, 2, 500, terminations, occurred, despite, the, low, radiation, dose, no, significant, evidence, of, changes, in, the, prevalence, of, congenital, anomalies, linked, to, the, accident, has, been, found, in, belarus, or, ukraine, in, sweden, and, finland, studies, found, no, association, between, radioactivity, and, congenital, malformations, larger, studies, such, as, the, eurocat, database, assessed, nearly, a, million, births, and, found, no, impacts, from, chernobyl, researchers, concluded, that, the, widespread, fear, about, the, effects, on, unborn, fetuses, was, not, justified, the, only, robust, evidence, of, negative, pregnancy, outcomes, linked, to, the, accident, were, the, elective, abortion, effects, due, to, anxiety, in, very, high, doses, radiation, can, cause, pregnancy, anomalies, but, the, malformation, of, organs, appears, to, be, a, deterministic, effect, with, a, threshold, dose, studies, on, regions, of, ukraine, and, belarus, suggest, that, around, 50, children, exposed, in, utero, during, weeks, 8, to, 25, of, gestation, may, have, experienced, an, increased, rate, of, intellectual, disability, and, lower, verbal, iq, the, chernobyl, liquidators, fathered, children, without, an, increase, in, developmental, anomalies, or, a, significant, rise, in, germline, mutations, a, 2021, study, based, on, whole, genome, sequencing, of, children, of, liquidators, indicated, no, trans, generational, genetic, effects, a, report, by, the, international, atomic, energy, agency, examines, the, environmental, consequences, of, the, accident, the, united, nations, scientific, committee, on, the, effects, of, atomic, radiation, estimated, a, global, collective, dose, from, the, accident, equivalent, to, 21, additional, days, of, world, exposure, to, natural, background, radiation, doses, were, far, higher, among, 530, 000, recovery, workers, who, averaged, an, extra, 50, years, of, typical, natural, background, radiation, exposure, estimates, of, deaths, resulting, from, the, accident, vary, greatly, due, to, differing, methodologies, and, data, in, 1994, thirty, one, deaths, were, directly, attributed, to, the, accident, all, among, reactor, staff, and, emergency, workers, the, chernobyl, forum, predicts, an, eventual, death, toll, of, up, to, 4, 000, among, those, exposed, to, the, highest, radiation, levels, 200, 000, emergency, workers, 116, 000, evacuees, and, 270, 000, residents, of, the, most, contaminated, areas, including, around, 50, emergency, workers, who, died, shortly, after, the, accident, 15, children, who, died, of, thyroid, cancer, and, a, predicted, 3, 935, deaths, from, radiation, induced, cancer, and, leukemia, a, 2006, paper, in, the, international, journal, of, cancer, estimated, that, chernobyl, may, have, caused, about, 1, 000, cases, of, thyroid, cancer, and, 4, 000, cases, of, other, cancers, in, europe, by, 2006, by, 2065, models, predict, 16, 000, cases, of, thyroid, cancer, and, 25, 000, cases, of, other, cancers, due, to, the, accident, the, risk, projections, suggest, that, by, now, chernobyl, may, have, caused, about, 1000, cases, of, thyroid, cancer, and, 4000, cases, of, other, cancers, in, europe, representing, about, 0, 01, of, all, incident, cancers, since, the, accident, models, predict, that, by, 2065, about, 16, 000, cases, of, thyroid, cancer, and, 25, 000, cases, of, other, cancers, may, be, expected, due, to, radiation, from, the, accident, whereas, several, hundred, million, cancer, cases, are, expected, from, other, causes, anti, nuclear, groups, such, as, the, union, of, concerned, scientists, ucs, have, publicized, estimates, suggesting, an, eventual, 50, 000, excess, cancer, cases, resulting, in, 25, 000, cancer, deaths, worldwide, excluding, thyroid, cancer, these, figures, are, based, on, a, linear, no, threshold, model, which, the, international, commission, on, radiological, protection, icrp, advises, against, using, for, risk, projections, the, 2006, torch, report, estimated, 30, 000, to, 60, 000, excess, cancer, deaths, worldwide, the, chernobyl, forum, revealed, in, 2004, that, thyroid, cancer, among, children, was, one, of, the, main, health, impacts, of, the, chernobyl, accident, due, to, ingestion, of, contaminated, dairy, products, and, inhalation, of, iodine, 131, more, than, 4, 000, cases, of, childhood, thyroid, cancer, were, reported, but, there, was, no, evidence, of, increased, solid, cancers, or, leukemia, the, who, s, radiation, program, reported, nine, deaths, out, of, the, 4, 000, thyroid, cancer, cases, by, 2005, unscear, reported, an, excess, of, over, 6, 000, thyroid, cancer, cases, among, those, exposed, as, children, or, adolescents, well, differentiated, thyroid, cancers, are, generally, treatable, with, a, five, year, survival, rate, of, 96, and, 92, after, 30, years, by, 2011, unscear, reported, 15, deaths, from, thyroid, cancer, the, iaea, states, that, there, has, been, no, increase, in, birth, defects, solid, cancers, or, other, abnormalities, corroborating, un, assessments, unscear, noted, the, possibility, of, long, term, genetic, defects, citing, a, doubling, of, radiation, induced, minisatellite, mutations, among, children, born, in, 1994, however, the, risk, of, thyroid, cancer, associated, with, the, chernobyl, accident, remains, high, according, to, published, studies, the, german, affiliate, of, the, international, physicians, for, the, prevention, of, nuclear, war, suggests, that, 10, 000, people, have, been, affected, by, thyroid, cancer, as, of, 2006, with, 50, 000, cases, expected, in, the, future, fred, mettler, a, radiation, expert, estimated, 9, 000, chernobyl, related, cancer, deaths, worldwide, noting, that, while, small, relative, to, normal, cancer, risks, the, numbers, are, large, in, absolute, terms, the, report, highlighted, the, risks, to, mental, health, from, exaggerated, radiation, fears, noting, that, labeling, the, affected, population, as, victims, contributed, to, a, sense, of, helplessness, mettler, also, commented, that, 20, years, later, the, population, remained, unsure, about, radiation, effects, leading, to, harmful, behaviors, the, united, nations, scientific, committee, on, the, effects, of, atomic, radiation, unscear, has, produced, assessments, of, the, radiation, effects, possibly, due, to, the, chernobyl, disaster, an, unusually, high, number, of, cases, of, down, syndrome, were, reported, in, belarus, in, january, 1987, but, there, was, no, subsequent, upward, trend, the, potential, deaths, from, the, chernobyl, disaster, are, heavily, debated, the, world, health, organization, predicted, 4, 000, future, cancer, deaths, in, surrounding, countries, based, on, the, linear, no, threshold, model, lnt, which, assumes, that, even, low, doses, of, radiation, increase, cancer, risk, proportionally, the, union, of, concerned, scientists, estimated, approximately, 27, 000, excess, cancer, deaths, worldwide, using, the, same, lnt, model, a, study, by, greenpeace, estimated, 10, 000, 200, 000, additional, deaths, in, belarus, russia, and, ukraine, from, 1990, to, 2004, the, report, was, criticized, for, relying, on, non, peer, reviewed, studies, while, gregory, h, rtl, a, who, spokesman, suggested, its, conclusions, were, ideologically, motivated, the, publication, chernobyl, consequences, of, the, catastrophe, for, people, and, the, environment, claimed, 985, 000, premature, deaths, but, was, criticized, for, bias, and, using, unverifiable, sources, it, is, difficult, to, establish, the, total, economic, cost, of, the, disaster, according, to, mikhail, gorbachev, the, soviet, union, spent, 18, billion, rbls, 5, 9, billion, in, today, s, dollars, on, containment, and, decontamination, virtually, bankrupting, itself, in, 2005, the, total, cost, over, 30, years, for, belarus, was, estimated, at, us, 235, billion, gorbachev, later, wrote, that, the, nuclear, meltdown, at, chernobyl, was, perhaps, the, real, cause, of, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, ongoing, costs, remain, significant, in, their, 2003, 2005, report, the, chernobyl, forum, stated, that, between, five, and, seven, percent, of, government, spending, in, ukraine, is, still, related, to, chernobyl, while, in, belarus, over, 13, billion, was, spent, between, 1991, and, 2003, in, 2018, ukraine, spent, five, to, seven, percent, of, its, national, budget, on, recovery, activities, the, economic, loss, is, estimated, at, 235, billion, in, belarus, a, significant, impact, was, the, removal, of, 784, 320, ha, 1, 938, 100, acres, of, agricultural, land, and, 694, 200, ha, 1, 715, 000, acres, of, forest, from, production, while, much, has, been, returned, to, use, agricultural, costs, have, risen, due, to, the, need, for, special, cultivation, techniques, politically, the, accident, was, significant, for, the, new, soviet, policy, of, glasnost, and, helped, forge, closer, soviet, us, relations, at, the, end, of, the, cold, war, 44, 48, the, disaster, also, became, a, key, factor, in, the, dissolution, of, the, soviet, union, and, shaped, the, new, eastern, europe, 20, 21, gorbachev, stated, that, more, than, anything, else, chernobyl, opened, the, possibility, of, much, greater, freedom, of, expression, to, the, point, that, the, soviet, system, as, we, knew, it, could, no, longer, continue, some, ukrainians, viewed, the, chernobyl, disaster, as, another, attempt, by, russians, to, destroy, them, comparable, to, the, holodomor, commentators, have, argued, that, the, chernobyl, disaster, was, more, likely, to, occur, in, a, communist, country, than, in, a, capitalist, one, soviet, power, plant, administrators, were, reportedly, not, empowered, to, make, crucial, decisions, during, the, crisis, because, of, the, distrust, many, had, in, the, soviet, authorities, which, engaged, in, a, cover, up, a, great, deal, of, debate, about, the, situation, occurred, in, the, first, world, during, the, early, days, of, the, event, journalists, mistrusted, many, professionals, and, they, in, turn, encouraged, the, public, to, mistrust, them, the, accident, raised, already, heightened, concerns, about, fission, reactors, worldwide, and, while, most, concern, was, focused, on, those, of, the, same, unusual, design, hundreds, of, disparate, nuclear, reactor, proposals, including, those, under, construction, at, chernobyl, reactors, numbers, 5, and, 6, were, eventually, cancelled, with, ballooning, costs, as, a, result, of, new, nuclear, reactor, safety, system, standards, and, the, legal, and, political, costs, in, dealing, with, the, increasingly, hostile, anxious, public, opinion, there, was, a, precipitous, drop, in, the, rate, of, new, reactor, construction, after, 1986, the, accident, also, raised, concerns, about, the, cavalier, safety, culture, in, the, soviet, nuclear, power, industry, slowing, industry, growth, and, forcing, the, soviet, government, to, become, less, secretive, about, its, operating, procedures, the, government, coverup, of, the, chernobyl, disaster, was, a, catalyst, for, glasnost, which, paved, the, way, for, reforms, leading, to, the, soviet, collapse, numerous, structural, and, construction, quality, issues, as, well, as, deviations, from, the, original, plant, design, had, been, known, to, the, kgb, since, at, least, 1973, and, passed, on, to, the, central, committee, which, took, no, action, and, classified, the, information, in, italy, the, chernobyl, accident, was, reflected, in, the, outcome, of, the, 1987, referendum, as, a, result, italy, began, phasing, out, its, nuclear, power, plants, in, 1988, a, decision, that, was, effectively, reversed, in, 2008, a, 2011, referendum, reiterated, italians, objections, to, nuclear, power, thus, abrogating, the, government, s, 2008, decision, in, germany, the, chernobyl, accident, led, to, the, creation, of, a, federal, environment, ministry, the, german, environmental, minister, was, given, the, authority, over, reactor, safety, as, well, a, responsibility, the, current, minister, still, holds, today, the, chernobyl, disaster, is, also, credited, with, strengthening, the, anti, nuclear, movement, in, germany, which, culminated, in, the, decision, to, end, the, use, of, nuclear, power, made, by, the, 1998, 2005, schr, der, government, a, temporary, reversal, of, this, policy, ended, with, the, fukushima, nuclear, disaster, in, direct, response, to, the, chernobyl, disaster, a, conference, to, create, a, convention, on, early, notification, of, a, nuclear, accident, was, called, in, 1986, by, the, international, atomic, energy, agency, the, resulting, treaty, has, bound, members, to, provide, notification, of, any, nuclear, and, radiation, accidents, that, occur, that, could, affect, other, states, along, with, the, convention, on, assistance, in, the, case, of, a, nuclear, accident, or, radiological, emergency, chernobyl, has, been, used, as, a, case, study, in, research, concerning, the, root, causes, of, such, disasters, such, as, sleep, deprivation, and, mismanagement, the, chernobyl, tragedy, has, inspired, many, artists, across, the, world, to, create, works, of, art, animation, video, games, theatre, and, cinema, about, the, disaster, the, hbo, series, chernobyl, and, the, book, voices, from, chernobyl, by, the, ukrainian, belarusian, writer, svetlana, alexievich, are, two, well, known, works, the, ukrainian, artist, roman, gumanyuk, created, a, series, of, artworks, called, pripyat, lights, or, chernobyl, shadows, that, includes, 30, oil, paintings, about, the, chernobyl, accident, exhibited, in, 2012, 2013, the, video, game, s, t, a, l, k, e, r, shadows, of, chernobyl, released, by, thq, in, 2007, is, a, first, person, shooter, set, in, the, exclusion, zone, a, prequel, called, s, t, a, l, k, e, r, clear, sky, was, released, in, 2008, following, with, a, sequel, s, t, a, l, k, e, r, call, of, pripyat, released, in, 2010, finally, the, horror, film, chernobyl, diaries, released, in, 2012, is, about, six, tourists, that, hire, a, tour, guide, to, take, them, to, the, abandoned, city, of, pripyat, where, they, discover, they, are, not, alone, filmmakers, have, created, documentaries, that, examine, the, aftermath, of, the, disaster, over, the, years, documentaries, like, the, oscar, winning, chernobyl, heart, released, in, 2003, explore, how, radiation, affected, people, living, in, the, area, and, information, about, the, long, term, side, effects, of, radiation, exposure, the, babushkas, of, chernobyl, 2015, is, a, documentary, about, three, women, who, decided, to, return, to, the, exclusion, zone, after, the, disaster, in, the, documentary, the, babushkas, show, the, polluted, water, their, food, from, radioactive, gardens, and, explain, how, they, manage, to, survive, in, this, exclusion, zone, despite, the, radioactive, levels, the,
