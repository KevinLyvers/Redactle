slavery, has, historically, been, widespread, in, africa, systems, of, servitude, and, slavery, were, once, commonplace, in, parts, of, africa, as, they, were, in, much, of, the, rest, of, the, ancient, and, medieval, world, when, the, trans, saharan, slave, trade, red, sea, slave, trade, indian, ocean, slave, trade, and, atlantic, slave, trade, which, started, in, the, 16th, century, began, many, of, the, pre, existing, local, african, slave, systems, began, supplying, captives, for, slave, markets, outside, africa, slavery, in, contemporary, africa, is, still, practised, despite, it, being, illegal, in, the, relevant, literature, african, slavery, is, categorized, into, indigenous, slavery, and, export, slavery, depending, on, whether, or, not, slaves, were, traded, beyond, the, continent, slavery, in, historical, africa, was, practised, in, many, different, forms, debt, slavery, enslavement, of, war, captives, military, slavery, slavery, for, prostitution, and, enslavement, of, criminals, were, all, practised, in, various, parts, of, africa, slavery, for, domestic, and, court, purposes, was, widespread, throughout, africa, plantation, slavery, also, occurred, primarily, on, the, eastern, coast, of, africa, and, in, parts, of, west, africa, the, importance, of, domestic, plantation, slavery, increased, during, the, 19th, century, due, to, the, abolition, of, the, atlantic, slave, trade, many, african, states, dependent, on, the, international, slave, trade, reoriented, their, economies, towards, legitimate, commerce, worked, by, slave, labour, multiple, forms, of, slavery, and, servitude, have, existed, throughout, african, history, and, were, shaped, by, indigenous, practices, of, slavery, as, well, as, the, roman, institution, of, slavery, and, the, later, christian, views, on, slavery, the, islamic, institutions, of, slavery, via, the, muslim, slave, trade, and, eventually, the, atlantic, slave, trade, slavery, was, a, part, of, the, economic, structure, of, african, societies, for, many, centuries, although, the, extent, varied, ibn, battuta, who, visited, the, ancient, kingdom, of, mali, in, the, mid, 14th, century, recounts, that, the, local, inhabitants, vied, with, each, other, in, the, number, of, slaves, and, servants, they, had, and, was, himself, given, a, slave, boy, as, a, hospitality, gift, in, sub, saharan, africa, the, slave, relationships, were, often, complex, with, rights, and, freedoms, given, to, individuals, held, in, slavery, and, restrictions, on, sale, and, treatment, by, their, masters, many, communities, had, hierarchies, between, different, types, of, slaves, for, example, differentiating, between, those, who, had, been, born, into, slavery, and, those, who, had, been, captured, through, war, the, slaves, in, africa, i, suppose, are, nearly, in, the, proportion, of, three, to, one, to, the, freemen, they, claim, no, reward, for, their, services, except, food, and, clothing, and, are, treated, with, kindness, or, severity, according, to, the, good, or, bad, disposition, of, their, masters, custom, however, has, established, certain, rules, with, regard, to, the, treatment, of, slaves, which, it, is, thought, dishonourable, to, violate, thus, the, domestic, slaves, or, such, as, are, born, in, a, man, s, own, house, are, treated, with, more, lenity, than, those, which, are, purchased, with, money, but, these, restrictions, on, the, power, of, the, master, extend, not, to, the, care, of, prisoners, taken, in, war, nor, to, that, of, slaves, purchased, with, money, all, these, unfortunate, beings, are, considered, as, strangers, and, foreigners, who, have, no, right, to, the, protection, of, the, law, and, may, be, treated, with, severity, or, sold, to, a, stranger, according, to, the, pleasure, of, their, owners, travels, in, the, interior, of, africa, mungo, park, travels, in, the, interior, of, africa, v, ii, chapter, xxii, war, and, slavery, the, forms, of, slavery, in, africa, were, closely, related, to, kinship, structures, in, many, african, communities, where, land, could, not, be, owned, enslavement, of, individuals, was, used, as, a, means, to, increase, the, influence, a, person, had, and, expand, connections, this, made, slaves, a, permanent, part, of, a, master, s, lineage, and, the, children, of, slaves, could, become, closely, connected, with, the, larger, family, ties, children, of, slaves, born, into, families, could, be, integrated, into, the, master, s, kinship, group, and, rise, to, prominent, positions, within, society, even, to, the, level, of, chief, in, some, instances, however, stigma, often, remained, attached, and, there, could, be, strict, separations, between, slave, members, of, a, kinship, group, and, those, related, to, the, master, chattel, slavery, is, a, specific, servitude, relationship, where, the, slave, is, treated, as, the, property, of, the, owner, as, such, the, owner, is, free, to, sell, trade, or, treat, the, slave, as, he, would, other, pieces, of, property, and, the, children, of, the, slave, often, are, retained, as, the, property, of, the, master, there, is, evidence, of, long, histories, of, chattel, slavery, in, the, nile, river, valley, much, of, the, sahel, and, north, africa, evidence, is, incomplete, about, the, extent, and, practices, of, chattel, slavery, throughout, much, of, the, rest, of, the, continent, prior, to, written, records, by, arab, or, european, traders, many, slave, relationships, in, africa, revolved, around, domestic, slavery, where, slaves, would, work, primarily, in, the, house, of, the, master, but, retain, some, freedoms, domestic, slaves, could, be, considered, part, of, the, master, s, household, and, would, not, be, sold, to, others, without, extreme, cause, the, slaves, could, own, the, profits, from, their, labour, whether, in, land, or, in, products, and, could, marry, and, pass, the, land, on, to, their, children, in, many, cases, pawnship, or, debt, bondage, slavery, involves, the, use, of, people, as, collateral, to, secure, the, repayment, of, debt, slave, labour, is, performed, by, the, debtor, or, a, relative, of, the, debtor, usually, a, child, pawnship, was, a, common, form, of, collateral, in, west, africa, it, involved, the, pledge, of, a, person, or, a, member, of, that, person, s, family, to, serve, another, person, providing, credit, pawnship, was, related, to, yet, distinct, from, slavery, in, most, conceptualizations, because, the, arrangement, could, include, limited, specific, terms, of, service, to, be, provided, and, because, kinship, ties, would, protect, the, person, from, being, sold, into, slavery, pawnship, was, a, common, practice, throughout, west, africa, prior, to, european, contact, including, among, the, akan, people, the, ewe, people, the, ga, people, the, yoruba, people, and, the, edo, people, in, modified, forms, it, also, existed, among, the, efik, people, the, igbo, people, the, ijaw, people, and, the, fon, people, military, slavery, involved, the, acquisition, and, training, of, conscripted, military, units, which, would, retain, the, identity, of, military, slaves, even, after, their, service, slave, soldier, groups, would, be, run, by, a, patron, who, could, be, the, head, of, a, government, or, an, independent, warlord, and, who, would, send, his, troops, out, for, money, and, his, own, political, interests, this, was, most, significant, in, the, nile, valley, primarily, in, sudan, and, uganda, with, slave, military, units, organized, by, various, islamic, authorities, and, with, the, war, chiefs, of, western, africa, the, military, units, in, sudan, were, formed, in, the, 1800s, through, large, scale, military, raiding, in, the, area, which, is, currently, the, countries, of, sudan, and, south, sudan, human, sacrifice, was, common, in, west, african, states, up, to, and, during, the, 19th, century, although, archaeological, evidence, is, not, clear, on, the, issue, prior, to, european, contact, in, those, societies, that, practised, human, sacrifice, slaves, became, the, most, prominent, victims, the, annual, customs, of, dahomey, were, the, most, notorious, example, of, human, sacrifice, of, slaves, where, 500, prisoners, would, be, sacrificed, sacrifices, were, carried, out, all, along, the, west, african, coast, and, further, inland, sacrifices, were, common, in, the, benin, empire, in, what, is, now, ghana, and, in, the, small, independent, states, in, what, is, now, southern, nigeria, in, the, ashanti, region, human, sacrifice, was, often, combined, with, capital, punishment, many, nations, such, as, the, bono, state, ashanti, of, present, day, ghana, and, the, yoruba, of, present, day, nigeria, were, involved, in, slave, trading, groups, such, as, the, imbangala, of, angola, and, the, nyamwezi, of, tanzania, would, serve, as, intermediaries, or, roving, bands, waging, war, on, african, states, to, capture, people, for, export, as, slaves, historians, john, thornton, and, linda, heywood, of, boston, university, have, estimated, that, of, the, africans, captured, and, then, sold, as, slaves, to, the, new, world, in, the, atlantic, slave, trade, around, 90, were, enslaved, by, fellow, africans, who, sold, them, to, european, traders, henry, louis, gates, the, harvard, chair, of, african, and, african, american, studies, has, stated, that, without, complex, business, partnerships, between, african, elites, and, european, traders, and, commercial, agents, the, slave, trade, to, the, new, world, would, have, been, impossible, at, least, on, the, scale, it, occurred, the, entire, bubi, ethnic, group, descends, from, escaped, intertribal, slaves, owned, by, various, ancient, west, central, african, ethnic, groups, like, most, other, regions, of, the, world, slavery, and, forced, labour, existed, in, many, kingdoms, and, societies, of, africa, for, hundreds, of, years, ugo, kwokeji, has, called, early, european, reports, of, slavery, throughout, africa, in, the, 1600s, unreliable, saying, they, conflated, various, forms, of, servitude, with, chattel, slavery, the, best, evidence, of, slave, practices, in, africa, come, from, the, major, kingdoms, particularly, along, the, coast, and, there, is, little, evidence, of, widespread, slavery, practices, in, stateless, societies, slave, trading, was, mostly, secondary, to, other, trade, relationships, however, there, is, evidence, of, a, trans, saharan, slave, trade, route, from, roman, times, which, persisted, in, the, area, after, the, fall, of, the, roman, empire, however, kinship, structures, and, rights, provided, to, slaves, except, those, captured, in, war, appears, to, have, limited, the, scope, of, slave, trading, before, the, start, of, the, trans, saharan, slave, trade, indian, ocean, slave, trade, and, the, atlantic, slave, trade, slavery, in, northern, africa, dates, back, to, ancient, egypt, the, new, kingdom, 1558, 1080, bc, brought, large, numbers, of, slaves, as, prisoners, of, war, up, the, nile, valley, and, used, them, for, domestic, and, supervised, labour, ptolemaic, egypt, 305, bc, 30, bc, used, both, land, and, sea, routes, to, bring, in, slaves, chattel, slavery, was, legal, and, widespread, throughout, north, africa, be, it, under, ancient, carthage, ca, 814, bc, 146, bc, or, later, when, the, region, was, controlled, by, the, roman, empire, 145, bc, ca, 430, ad, and, the, eastern, romans, 533, to, 695, ad, a, slave, trade, bringing, saharans, through, the, desert, to, north, africa, which, existed, in, roman, times, continued, and, documentary, evidence, in, the, nile, valley, shows, it, to, have, been, regulated, there, by, treaty, as, the, roman, republic, expanded, it, enslaved, defeated, enemies, and, roman, conquests, in, africa, were, no, exception, for, example, orosius, records, that, rome, enslaved, 27, 000, people, from, north, africa, in, 256, bc, piracy, became, an, important, source, of, slaves, for, the, roman, empire, and, in, the, 5th, century, ad, pirates, would, raid, coastal, north, african, villages, and, enslave, those, captured, chattel, slavery, persisted, after, the, fall, of, the, roman, empire, in, the, largely, christian, communities, of, the, region, after, the, islamic, trade, expansion, across, the, sahara, the, practices, continued, and, eventually, the, assimilative, form, of, slavery, spread, to, major, societies, on, the, southern, end, of, the, sahara, such, as, mali, songhai, and, ghana, the, medieval, slave, trade, in, europe, was, mainly, to, the, east, and, south, the, christian, byzantine, empire, and, the, muslim, world, were, the, destinations, and, central, and, eastern, europe, an, important, source, of, slaves, the, slave, trade, in, medieval, europe, was, carried, out, in, parts, of, europe, by, both, christians, and, jews, in, the, early, medieval, period, jews, had, a, near, monopoly, on, trade, between, islamic, and, christian, countries, but, by, the, thirteenth, century, this, no, longer, applied, to, the, slave, trade, the, mamluks, were, slave, soldiers, who, converted, to, islam, and, served, the, muslim, caliphs, and, the, ayyubid, sultans, during, the, middle, ages, the, first, mamluks, served, the, abbasid, caliphs, in, 9th, century, baghdad, over, time, they, became, a, powerful, military, caste, and, on, more, than, one, occasion, they, seized, power, for, themselves, for, example, ruling, egypt, from, 1250, to, 1517, from, 1250, on, egypt, was, ruled, by, the, bahri, dynasty, of, kipchak, turk, origin, white, enslaved, people, from, the, caucasus, served, in, the, army, and, formed, an, elite, corps, of, troops, eventually, revolting, in, egypt, to, form, the, burgi, dynasty, according, to, robert, davis, between, 1, million, and, 1, 25, million, europeans, were, captured, by, barbary, pirates, and, sold, as, slaves, to, north, africa, and, the, ottoman, empire, between, the, 16th, and, 19th, centuries, however, to, extrapolate, his, numbers, davis, assumes, the, number, of, european, slaves, captured, by, barbary, pirates, were, constant, for, a, 250, year, period, stating, there, are, no, records, of, how, many, men, women, and, children, were, enslaved, but, it, is, possible, to, calculate, roughly, the, number, of, fresh, captives, that, would, have, been, needed, to, keep, populations, steady, and, replace, those, slaves, who, died, escaped, were, ransomed, or, converted, to, islam, on, this, basis, it, is, thought, that, around, 8, 500, new, slaves, were, needed, annually, to, replenish, numbers, about, 850, 000, captives, over, the, century, from, 1580, to, 1680, by, extension, for, the, 250, years, between, 1530, and, 1780, the, figure, could, easily, have, been, as, high, as, 1, 250, 000, davis, numbers, have, been, disputed, by, other, historians, such, as, david, earle, who, cautions, that, the, true, picture, of, european, slaves, is, clouded, by, the, fact, the, corsairs, also, seized, non, christian, whites, from, eastern, europe, and, black, people, from, west, africa, in, addition, the, number, of, slaves, traded, was, hyperactive, with, exaggerated, estimates, relying, on, peak, years, to, calculate, averages, for, entire, centuries, or, millennia, hence, there, were, wide, fluctuations, year, to, year, particularly, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, given, slave, imports, and, also, given, the, fact, that, prior, to, the, 1840s, there, are, no, consistent, records, middle, east, expert, john, wright, cautions, that, modern, estimates, are, based, on, back, calculations, from, human, observation, such, observations, across, the, late, 1500s, and, early, 1600s, observers, estimate, that, around, 35, 000, european, christian, slaves, held, throughout, this, period, on, the, barbary, coast, across, tripoli, tunis, but, mostly, in, algiers, the, majority, were, sailors, taken, with, their, ships, but, others, were, fishermen, and, coastal, villagers, and, overall, most, of, the, captives, were, people, from, lands, close, to, africa, particularly, spain, and, italy, the, coastal, villages, and, towns, of, italy, portugal, spain, and, mediterranean, islands, were, frequently, attacked, by, the, pirates, and, long, stretches, of, the, italian, and, spanish, coasts, were, almost, completely, abandoned, by, their, inhabitants, after, 1600, barbary, pirates, occasionally, entered, the, atlantic, and, struck, as, far, north, as, iceland, the, most, famous, corsairs, were, the, ottoman, barbarossa, redbeard, and, his, older, brother, oru, turgut, reis, known, as, dragut, in, the, west, kurto, lu, known, as, curtogoli, in, the, west, kemal, reis, salih, reis, and, koca, murat, reis, in, 1544, hayreddin, barbarossa, captured, ischia, taking, 4, 000, prisoners, in, the, process, and, deported, to, slavery, some, 9, 000, inhabitants, of, lipari, almost, the, entire, population, in, 1551, dragut, enslaved, the, entire, population, of, the, maltese, island, gozo, between, 5, 000, and, 6, 000, sending, them, to, libya, when, pirates, sacked, vieste, in, southern, italy, in, 1554, they, took, an, estimated, 7, 000, slaves, in, 1555, turgut, reis, sailed, to, corsica, and, ransacked, bastia, taking, 6, 000, prisoners, in, 1558, barbary, corsairs, captured, the, town, of, ciutadella, destroyed, it, slaughtered, the, inhabitants, and, carried, off, 3, 000, survivors, to, istanbul, as, slaves, in, 1563, turgut, reis, landed, at, the, shores, of, the, province, of, granada, spain, and, captured, the, coastal, settlements, in, the, area, like, almu, car, along, with, 4, 000, prisoners, barbary, pirates, frequently, attacked, the, balearic, islands, resulting, in, many, coastal, watchtowers, and, fortified, churches, being, erected, the, threat, was, so, severe, that, formentera, became, uninhabited, early, modern, sources, are, full, of, descriptions, of, the, sufferings, of, christian, galley, slaves, of, the, barbary, corsairs, those, who, have, not, seen, a, galley, at, sea, especially, in, chasing, or, being, chased, cannot, well, conceive, the, shock, such, a, spectacle, must, give, to, a, heart, capable, of, the, least, tincture, of, commiseration, to, behold, ranks, and, files, of, half, naked, half, starved, half, tanned, meagre, wretches, chained, to, a, plank, from, whence, they, remove, not, for, months, together, commonly, half, a, year, urged, on, even, beyond, human, strength, with, cruel, and, repeated, blows, on, their, bare, flesh, as, late, as, 1798, the, islet, near, sardinia, was, attacked, by, the, tunisians, and, over, 900, inhabitants, were, taken, away, as, slaves, sahrawi, moorish, society, in, northwest, africa, was, traditionally, and, still, is, to, some, extent, stratified, into, several, tribal, castes, with, the, hassane, warrior, tribes, ruling, and, extracting, tribute, horma, from, the, subservient, berber, descended, znaga, tribes, below, them, ranked, servile, groups, known, as, haratin, a, black, population, enslaved, sub, saharan, africans, were, also, transported, across, north, africa, into, arabia, to, do, agricultural, work, because, of, their, resistance, to, malaria, that, plagued, the, arabia, and, north, africa, at, the, time, of, early, enslavement, sub, saharan, africans, were, able, to, endure, the, malaria, infested, lands, they, were, transported, to, which, is, why, north, africans, were, not, transported, despite, their, close, proximity, to, arabia, and, its, surrounding, lands, in, the, horn, of, africa, the, christian, kings, of, the, ethiopian, empire, captured, slaves, primarily, from, the, pagan, nilotic, shanqella, and, oromo, peoples, from, their, western, borderlands, or, from, newly, conquered, or, reconquered, lowland, territories, the, somali, and, afar, muslim, sultanates, such, as, the, medieval, adal, sultanate, through, their, ports, also, traded, zanj, bantu, slaves, captured, from, the, hinterland, slavery, as, practised, in, ethiopia, was, essentially, domestic, and, was, geared, more, towards, women, this, was, the, trend, for, most, of, africa, as, well, women, were, transported, across, the, sahara, the, middle, east, the, mediterranean, and, the, indian, ocean, trade, more, than, men, enslaved, people, served, in, the, houses, of, their, masters, or, mistresses, and, were, not, employed, to, any, significant, extent, for, productive, purpose, the, enslaved, were, regarded, as, second, class, members, of, their, owners, family, the, first, attempt, to, abolish, slavery, in, ethiopia, was, made, by, emperor, tewodros, ii, r, 1855, 68, although, the, slave, trade, was, not, legally, abolished, until, 1923, when, ethiopia, ascended, to, the, league, of, nations, anti, slavery, society, estimated, there, were, 2, million, slaves, in, the, early, 1930s, out, of, an, estimated, population, of, between, 8, and, 16, million, slavery, continued, in, ethiopia, until, the, italian, invasion, in, october, 1935, when, the, institution, was, abolished, by, order, of, the, italian, occupying, forces, in, response, to, pressure, by, western, allies, of, world, war, ii, ethiopia, officially, abolished, slavery, and, involuntary, servitude, after, it, regained, its, independence, in, 1942, on, 26, august, 1942, haile, selassie, issued, a, proclamation, outlawing, slavery, in, somali, territories, slaves, were, purchased, in, the, slave, market, exclusively, to, do, work, on, plantations, in, terms, of, legal, considerations, the, customs, regarding, the, treatment, of, bantu, slaves, were, established, by, the, decree, of, sultans, and, local, administrative, delegates, these, plantation, slaves, often, acquired, their, freedom, through, eventual, emancipation, escape, and, ransom, slaves, were, transported, since, antiquity, along, trade, routes, crossing, the, sahara, oral, tradition, recounts, slavery, existing, in, the, kingdom, of, kongo, from, the, time, of, its, formation, with, lukeni, lua, nimi, enslaving, the, mwene, kabunga, whom, he, conquered, to, establish, the, kingdom, early, portuguese, writings, show, that, the, kingdom, did, have, slavery, before, contact, but, that, they, were, primarily, war, captives, from, the, kingdom, of, ndongo, slavery, was, common, along, the, upper, congo, river, and, in, the, second, half, of, the, 18th, century, the, region, became, a, major, source, of, slaves, for, the, atlantic, slave, trade, when, high, slave, prices, on, the, coast, made, long, distance, slave, trading, profitable, when, the, atlantic, trade, came, to, an, end, the, price, of, slaves, dropped, dramatically, and, the, regional, slave, trade, grew, dominated, by, bobangi, traders, the, bobangi, also, purchased, many, slaves, with, profits, from, selling, ivory, whom, they, used, to, populate, their, villages, slaves, who, had, been, sold, by, their, kin, group, typically, as, a, result, of, undesirable, behaviour, such, as, adultery, were, unlikely, to, attempt, to, flee, the, sale, of, children, was, also, common, in, times, of, famine, captured, slaves, were, however, likely, to, attempt, to, escape, and, had, to, be, moved, hundreds, of, kilometres, from, their, homes, as, a, safeguard, against, this, the, slave, trade, had, a, profound, impact, on, this, region, of, central, africa, completely, reshaping, various, aspects, of, society, for, instance, the, slave, trade, helped, to, create, a, robust, regional, trade, network, for, the, foodstuffs, and, crafted, goods, of, small, producers, along, the, river, as, only, a, few, slaves, in, a, canoe, were, sufficient, to, cover, the, cost, of, a, trip, and, still, make, a, profit, traders, could, fill, any, unused, space, on, their, canoes, with, other, goods, and, transport, them, long, distances, without, a, significant, markup, on, price, while, the, large, profits, from, the, congo, river, slave, trade, only, went, to, a, small, number, of, traders, this, aspect, of, the, trade, provided, some, benefit, to, local, producers, and, consumers, various, forms, of, slavery, were, practised, in, diverse, ways, in, different, communities, of, west, africa, prior, to, european, trade, according, to, ghanaian, historian, akosua, perbi, indigenous, slavery, in, locations, like, ghana, had, been, established, by, the, 1st, century, ad, with, origins, sometime, in, the, ancient, period, even, though, slavery, did, exist, it, was, not, nearly, as, prevalent, within, most, west, african, societies, that, were, not, islamic, before, the, trans, atlantic, slave, trade, the, prerequisites, for, slave, societies, to, exist, weren, t, present, in, west, africa, prior, to, the, atlantic, slave, trade, considering, the, small, market, sizes, and, the, lack, of, a, division, of, labour, most, west, african, societies, were, formed, in, kinship, units, which, would, make, slavery, a, rather, marginal, part, of, the, production, process, within, them, slaves, within, kinship, based, societies, would, have, had, almost, the, same, roles, that, free, members, had, however, nigerian, historian, professor, philip, igbafe, says, that, until, the, late, 19th, century, slavery, in, the, kingdom, of, benin, as, well, as, in, other, west, african, kingdoms, had, its, own, place, in, the, structure, of, the, state, having, its, roots, in, the, economic, military, social, and, political, necessities, of, the, benin, kingdom, slaves, were, owned, by, the, oba, king, and, by, ordinary, citizens, in, pre, colonial, benin, they, were, acquired, in, a, number, of, ways, through, wars, of, conquest, and, expansion, through, gifts, to, the, oba, who, also, inherited, the, slaves, of, those, who, died, intestate, and, by, tribute, paid, by, dependent, territories, to, the, oba, and, prominent, chiefs, lastly, hardened, criminals, or, those, guilty, of, serious, crimes, were, either, executed, or, sold, into, slavery, the, possession, of, a, large, number, of, slaves, was, an, index, of, a, man, s, status, slaves, served, in, the, militia, and, were, also, the, main, labour, force, for, the, chiefs, as, well, as, serving, the, local, need, for, human, sacrifices, the, eventual, abolition, of, slavery, created, a, host, of, problems, which, had, economic, political, and, social, ramifications, martin, klein, has, said, that, before, the, atlantic, trade, slaves, in, western, sudan, made, up, a, small, part, of, the, population, lived, within, the, household, worked, alongside, free, members, of, the, household, and, participated, in, a, network, of, face, to, face, links, with, the, development, of, the, trans, saharan, slave, trade, and, the, economies, of, gold, in, the, western, sahel, a, number, of, the, major, states, became, organized, around, the, slave, trade, including, the, ghana, empire, the, mali, empire, the, bono, state, and, songhai, empire, however, other, communities, in, west, africa, largely, resisted, the, slave, trade, the, jola, refused, to, participate, in, the, slave, trade, up, into, the, end, of, the, seventeenth, century, and, did, not, use, slave, labour, within, their, own, communities, until, the, nineteenth, century, the, kru, and, baga, also, fought, against, the, slave, trade, the, mossi, kingdoms, tried, to, take, over, key, sites, in, the, trans, saharan, trade, and, when, these, efforts, failed, became, defenders, against, slave, raiding, by, the, powerful, states, of, the, western, sahel, the, mossi, eventually, entered, the, slave, trade, in, the, 1800s, mainly, in, the, atlantic, slave, trade, senegal, was, a, catalyst, for, the, slave, trade, and, from, the, homann, heirs, map, figure, shown, shows, a, starting, point, for, migration, and, a, firm, port, of, trade, the, culture, of, the, gold, coast, was, based, largely, on, the, power, that, individuals, held, rather, than, the, land, cultivated, by, a, family, western, africa, developed, slavery, by, analysing, the, advantages, to, the, aristocracy, of, slavery, and, what, would, best, suit, the, region, this, sort, of, governing, used, the, political, tool, of, discerning, the, different, labours, and, methods, of, assimilative, slavery, domestic, and, agricultural, labour, became, more, evidently, primary, in, western, africa, due, to, slaves, being, regarded, as, political, tools, of, access, and, status, slaves, often, had, more, wives, than, their, owners, and, this, boosted, the, status, of, their, owners, slaves, were, not, all, used, for, the, same, purpose, european, colonizing, countries, participated, in, the, trade, to, suit, the, economic, needs, of, their, individual, countries, the, parallel, of, moorish, traders, in, the, desert, compared, to, portuguese, traders, who, were, not, as, established, pointed, out, the, differences, in, uses, of, slaves, at, this, point, and, where, they, were, headed, in, the, trade, historian, walter, rodney, identified, no, slavery, or, significant, domestic, servitude, in, early, european, accounts, on, the, upper, guinea, region, and, i, a, akinjogbin, contends, that, european, accounts, reveal, that, the, slave, trade, was, not, a, major, activity, along, the, coast, controlled, by, the, yoruba, people, and, aja, people, before, europeans, arrived, in, a, paper, read, to, the, ethnological, society, of, london, in, 1866, the, viceroy, of, lokoja, mr, t, valentine, robins, who, in, 1864, accompanied, an, expedition, up, the, river, niger, aboard, hms, investigator, described, slavery, in, the, region, upon, slavery, mr, robins, remarked, that, it, was, not, what, people, in, england, thought, it, to, be, it, means, as, continually, found, in, this, part, of, africa, belonging, to, a, family, group, there, is, no, compulsory, labour, the, owner, and, the, slave, work, together, eat, like, food, wear, like, clothing, and, sleep, in, the, same, huts, some, slaves, have, more, wives, than, their, masters, it, gives, protection, to, the, slaves, and, everything, necessary, for, their, subsistence, food, and, clothing, a, free, man, is, worse, off, than, a, slave, he, cannot, claim, his, food, from, anyone, with, the, beginning, of, the, atlantic, slave, trade, demand, for, slaves, in, west, africa, increased, and, a, number, of, states, became, centered, on, the, slave, trade, and, domestic, slavery, increased, dramatically, hugh, clapperton, in, 1824, believed, that, half, the, population, of, kano, were, enslaved, people, near, the, gold, coast, many, of, those, enslaved, came, from, deep, inside, the, interior, of, the, continent, as, defeated, people, from, numerous, wars, and, were, sold, off, as, part, of, a, practice, called, eating, the, country, that, aimed, to, disperse, fallen, enemies, and, prevent, regrouping, according, to, ghanaian, historian, akosua, perbi, from, the, 15th, to, 19th, centuries, in, ghana, major, sources, of, slaves, were, warfare, slave, markets, pawning, raids, kidnapping, and, tributes, while, minor, sources, were, from, gifts, convictions, communal, or, private, deals, in, the, senegambia, region, between, 1300, and, 1900, close, to, one, third, of, the, population, was, enslaved, in, early, islamic, states, of, the, western, sahel, including, ghana, 750, 1076, mali, 1235, 1645, segou, 1712, 1861, and, songhai, 1275, 1591, about, a, third, of, the, population, were, enslaved, in, sierra, leone, in, the, 19th, century, about, half, of, the, population, consisted, of, enslaved, people, among, the, vai, people, during, the, 19th, century, three, quarters, of, the, people, were, slaves, in, the, 19th, century, at, least, half, the, population, was, enslaved, among, the, duala, of, the, cameroon, and, other, peoples, of, the, lower, niger, the, kongo, and, the, kasanje, kingdom, and, chokwe, of, angola, among, the, ashanti, and, yoruba, a, third, of, the, population, consisted, of, enslaved, people, the, population, of, the, kanem, 1600, 1800, was, about, one, third, enslaved, it, was, perhaps, 40, in, bornu, 1580, 1890, between, 1750, and, 1900, from, one, to, two, thirds, of, the, entire, population, of, the, fulani, jihad, states, consisted, of, enslaved, people, the, population, of, the, largest, fulani, state, sokoto, was, at, least, half, enslaved, in, the, 19th, century, among, the, adrar, 15, per, cent, of, people, were, enslaved, and, 75, per, cent, of, the, gurma, were, enslaved, slavery, was, extremely, common, among, the, tuareg, peoples, and, many, still, hold, slaves, today, when, british, rule, was, first, imposed, on, the, sokoto, caliphate, and, the, surrounding, areas, in, northern, nigeria, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, approximately, 2, million, to, 2, 5, million, people, there, were, enslaved, slavery, in, northern, nigeria, was, finally, outlawed, in, 1936, with, sea, trade, from, the, eastern, african, great, lakes, region, to, persia, china, and, india, during, the, first, millennium, ad, slaves, are, mentioned, as, a, commodity, of, secondary, importance, to, gold, and, ivory, when, mentioned, the, slave, trade, appears, to, have, been, small, scale, and, mostly, involves, slave, raiding, of, women, and, children, along, the, islands, of, kilwa, kisiwani, madagascar, and, pemba, in, places, such, as, uganda, the, experience, for, women, in, slavery, was, different, from, that, of, customary, slavery, practices, at, the, time, the, roles, assumed, were, based, on, gender, and, position, within, the, society, first, one, must, make, the, distinction, in, ugandan, slavery, of, peasants, and, slaves, researchers, shane, doyle, and, henri, m, dard, assert, the, distinction, with, the, following, peasants, were, rewarded, for, valour, in, battle, by, the, present, of, slaves, by, the, lord, or, chief, for, whom, they, had, fought, they, could, be, given, slaves, by, relatives, who, had, been, promoted, to, the, rank, of, chiefs, and, they, could, inherit, slaves, from, their, fathers, there, were, the, abanyage, those, pillaged, or, stolen, in, war, as, well, as, the, abagule, those, bought, all, these, came, under, the, category, of, abenvumu, or, true, slaves, that, is, to, say, people, not, free, in, any, sense, in, a, superior, position, were, the, young, ganda, given, by, their, maternal, uncles, into, slavery, or, pawnship, usually, in, lieu, of, debts, besides, such, slaves, both, chiefs, and, king, were, served, by, sons, of, well, to, do, men, who, wanted, to, please, them, and, attract, favour, for, themselves, or, their, children, these, were, the, abasige, and, formed, a, big, addition, to, a, noble, household, all, these, different, classes, of, dependents, in, a, household, were, classed, as, medard, doyle, abaddu, male, servants, or, abazana, female, servants, whether, they, were, slave, or, free, born, 175, in, the, great, lakes, region, of, africa, around, present, day, uganda, linguistic, evidence, shows, the, existence, of, slavery, through, war, capture, trade, and, pawning, going, back, hundreds, of, years, however, these, forms, particularly, pawning, appear, to, have, increased, significantly, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, these, slaves, were, considered, to, be, more, trustworthy, than, those, from, the, gold, coast, they, were, regarded, with, more, prestige, because, of, the, training, they, responded, to, the, language, for, slaves, in, the, great, lakes, region, varied, this, region, of, water, made, it, easy, for, capture, of, slaves, and, transport, captive, refugee, slave, peasant, were, all, used, in, order, to, describe, those, in, the, trade, the, distinction, was, made, by, where, and, for, what, purpose, they, would, be, utilized, for, methods, like, pillage, plunder, and, capture, were, all, semantics, common, in, this, region, to, depict, the, trade, historians, campbell, and, alpers, argue, that, there, were, a, host, of, different, categories, of, labour, in, southeast, africa, and, that, the, distinction, between, slave, and, free, individuals, was, not, particularly, relevant, in, most, societies, however, with, increasing, international, trade, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, century, southeast, africa, began, to, be, involved, significantly, in, the, atlantic, slave, trade, for, example, with, the, king, of, kilwa, island, signing, a, treaty, with, a, french, merchant, in, 1776, for, the, delivery, of, 1, 000, slaves, per, year, at, about, the, same, time, merchants, from, oman, india, and, southeast, africa, began, establishing, plantations, along, the, coasts, and, on, the, islands, to, provide, workers, on, these, plantations, slave, raiding, and, slave, holding, became, increasingly, important, in, the, region, and, slave, traders, most, notably, tippu, tip, became, prominent, in, the, political, environment, of, the, region, the, southeast, african, trade, reached, its, height, in, the, early, decades, of, the, 1800s, with, up, to, 30, 000, slaves, sold, per, year, however, slavery, never, became, a, significant, part, of, the, domestic, economies, except, in, sultanate, of, zanzibar, where, plantations, and, agricultural, slavery, were, maintained, author, and, historian, timothy, insoll, wrote, figures, record, the, exporting, of, 718, 000, slaves, from, the, swahili, coast, during, the, 19th, century, and, the, retention, of, 769, 000, on, the, coast, at, various, times, between, 65, and, 90, per, cent, of, zanzibar, was, enslaved, along, the, kenya, coast, 90, per, cent, of, the, population, was, enslaved, while, half, of, madagascar, s, population, was, enslaved, slave, relationships, in, africa, have, been, transformed, through, four, large, scale, processes, the, trans, saharan, slave, trade, the, indian, ocean, slave, trade, the, atlantic, slave, trade, and, the, slave, emancipation, policies, and, movements, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, each, of, these, processes, significantly, changed, the, forms, level, and, economics, of, slavery, in, africa, slave, practices, in, africa, were, used, during, different, periods, to, justify, specific, forms, of, european, engagement, with, the, peoples, of, africa, eighteenth, century, writers, in, europe, claimed, that, slavery, in, africa, was, quite, brutal, in, order, to, justify, the, atlantic, slave, trade, later, writers, used, similar, arguments, to, justify, intervention, and, eventual, colonization, by, european, powers, to, end, slavery, in, africa, africans, knew, what, awaited, slaves, in, the, new, world, many, elite, africans, visited, europe, on, slave, ships, following, the, prevailing, winds, through, the, new, world, one, example, of, this, occurred, when, antonio, manuel, kongo, s, ambassador, to, the, vatican, went, to, europe, in, 1604, stopping, first, in, bahia, brazil, where, he, arranged, to, free, a, countryman, who, had, been, wrongfully, enslaved, african, monarchs, also, sent, their, children, along, these, same, slave, routes, to, be, educated, in, europe, and, thousands, of, former, slaves, eventually, returned, to, settle, liberia, and, sierra, leone, early, records, of, the, trans, saharan, slave, trade, come, from, ancient, greek, historian, herodotus, in, the, 5th, century, bc, the, garamentes, were, recorded, by, herodotus, as, engaging, in, the, trans, saharan, slave, trade, and, enslaving, cave, dwelling, ethiopians, ethiopian, being, a, greek, term, for, black, as, opposed, to, being, from, the, region, of, ethiopia, or, troglodytae, the, berber, garamentes, relied, heavily, on, the, labour, of, slaves, from, sub, saharan, africa, and, used, slaves, in, their, own, communities, to, construct, and, maintain, underground, irrigation, systems, known, to, berbers, as, foggara, in, the, early, roman, empire, the, city, of, lepcis, established, a, slave, market, to, buy, and, sell, slaves, from, the, african, interior, the, empire, imposed, a, customs, tax, on, the, trade, of, slaves, in, 5th, century, ad, roman, carthage, was, trading, in, black, slaves, brought, across, the, sahara, black, slaves, seem, to, have, been, valued, in, the, mediterranean, as, household, slaves, for, their, exotic, appearance, some, historians, argue, that, the, scale, of, slave, trade, in, this, period, may, have, been, higher, than, in, medieval, times, due, to, the, high, demand, for, slaves, in, the, roman, empire, slave, trading, in, the, indian, ocean, goes, back, to, 2500, bc, ancient, assyrians, and, babylonians, egyptians, greeks, indians, and, persians, all, traded, slaves, on, small, scale, across, the, indian, ocean, and, sometimes, the, red, sea, slave, trading, in, the, red, sea, around, the, time, of, alexander, the, great, is, described, by, agatharchides, strabo, s, geographica, completed, after, 23, ad, mentions, greeks, from, egypt, trading, slaves, at, the, port, of, adulis, and, other, ports, on, the, somali, coast, pliny, the, elder, s, natural, history, published, in, 77, ad, also, described, indian, ocean, slave, trading, in, the, 1st, century, ad, periplus, of, the, erythraean, sea, advised, of, slave, trading, opportunities, in, the, region, particularly, in, the, trading, of, beautiful, girls, for, concubinage, according, to, this, manual, slaves, were, exported, from, omana, likely, near, modern, day, oman, and, kan, to, the, west, coast, of, india, the, ancient, indian, ocean, slave, trade, was, enabled, by, building, boats, capable, of, carrying, large, numbers, of, human, beings, across, the, persian, gulf, with, wood, imported, from, india, this, shipbuilding, goes, back, to, assyrian, babylonian, and, achaemenid, times, after, the, involvement, of, the, byzantine, empire, and, sassanian, empire, in, slave, trading, in, the, 1st, century, it, became, a, major, enterprise, cosmas, indicopleustes, wrote, in, his, christian, topography, 550, ad, that, slaves, captured, in, ethiopia, would, be, imported, into, byzantine, egypt, via, the, red, sea, he, also, mentioned, the, import, of, non, african, eunuchs, by, the, byzantines, from, mesopotamia, and, india, after, the, 1st, century, the, export, of, black, africans, became, a, constant, factor, under, the, sassanians, the, indian, ocean, trade, transported, not, just, slaves, but, also, scholars, and, merchants, the, enslavement, of, africans, for, eastern, markets, started, before, the, 7th, century, but, remained, at, low, levels, until, 1750, the, volume, of, the, trade, peaked, around, 1850, but, may, largely, have, ended, around, 1900, muslim, participation, in, the, slave, trade, started, in, the, eighth, and, ninth, centuries, ad, beginning, with, small, scale, movements, of, people, largely, from, the, eastern, great, lakes, region, and, the, sahel, islamic, law, allowed, slavery, but, prohibited, slavery, involving, other, pre, existing, muslims, as, a, result, the, main, targets, for, enslavement, were, the, people, who, lived, in, the, frontier, areas, of, islam, in, africa, the, trade, of, slaves, across, the, sahara, and, the, indian, ocean, also, has, a, long, history, beginning, with, the, control, of, sea, routes, by, arab, traders, in, the, ninth, century, it, is, estimated, that, at, that, time, a, few, thousand, enslaved, people, were, taken, each, year, from, the, red, sea, and, indian, ocean, coast, they, were, sold, throughout, the, middle, east, this, trade, accelerated, as, superior, ships, led, to, more, trade, and, greater, demand, for, labour, on, plantation, eventually, tens, of, thousands, per, year, were, being, taken, on, the, swahili, coast, the, afro, arab, slavers, captured, bantu, peoples, from, the, interior, and, brought, them, to, the, littoral, there, the, slaves, gradually, assimilated, in, the, rural, areas, particularly, on, the, unguja, and, pemba, islands, this, changed, the, slave, relationships, by, creating, new, forms, of, employment, by, slaves, as, eunuchs, to, guard, harems, and, in, military, units, and, creating, conditions, for, freedom, namely, conversion, although, it, would, only, free, a, slave, s, children, although, the, level, of, trade, remained, relatively, small, the, total, number, of, slaves, over, the, multiple, centuries, of, the, trade, s, existence, because, of, its, small, and, gradual, nature, the, impact, on, slavery, practices, in, communities, that, did, not, convert, to, islam, was, relatively, small, however, in, the, 1800s, the, slave, trade, from, africa, to, the, islamic, countries, picked, up, significantly, when, the, european, slave, trade, ended, around, the, 1850s, the, slave, trade, to, the, east, picked, up, significantly, only, to, end, with, the, european, colonization, of, africa, around, 1900, between, 1500, and, 1900, up, to, 17, million, africans, slaves, were, transported, by, muslim, traders, to, the, coast, of, the, indian, ocean, the, middle, east, and, north, africa, in, 1814, swiss, explorer, johann, burckhardt, wrote, of, his, travels, in, egypt, and, nubia, where, he, saw, the, practice, of, slave, trading, i, frequently, witnessed, scenes, of, the, most, shameless, indecency, which, the, traders, who, were, the, principal, actors, only, laughed, at, i, may, venture, to, state, that, very, few, female, slaves, who, have, passed, their, tenth, year, reach, egypt, or, arabia, in, a, state, of, virginity, david, livingstone, talking, about, the, slave, trade, in, east, africa, in, his, journals, to, overdraw, its, evil, is, a, simple, impossibility, 442, livingstone, wrote, about, a, group, of, slaves, forced, by, arab, slave, traders, to, march, in, the, african, great, lakes, region, when, he, was, travelling, there, in, 1866, 19th, june, 1866, we, passed, a, woman, tied, by, the, neck, to, a, tree, and, dead, the, people, of, the,

recovered, 56, 26th, june, 1866, we, passed, a, slave, woman, shot, or, stabbed, through, the, body, and, lying, on, the, path, a, group, of, men, stood, about, a, hundred, yards, off, on, one, side, and, another, of, the, women, on, the, other, side, looking, on, they, said, an, arab, who, passed, early, that, morning, had, done, it, in, anger, at, losing, the, price, he, had, given, for, her, because, she, was, unable, to, walk, any, longer, 27th, june, 1866, to, day, we, came, upon, a, man, dead, from, starvation, as, he, was, very, thin, one, of, our, men, wandered, and, found, many, slaves, with, slave, sticks, on, abandoned, by, their, masters, from, want, of, food, they, were, too, weak, to, be, able, to, speak, or, say, where, they, had, come, from, some, were, quite, young, 62, the, lethality, of, the, trans, saharan, routes, is, comparable, to, those, of, the, trans, atlantic, deaths, of, slaves, in, egypt, and, north, africa, were, very, high, even, if, they, were, fed, and, treated, well, medieval, manuals, for, slave, buyers, written, in, arabic, persian, and, turkish, explained, that, africans, from, sudanic, and, ethiopian, areas, are, prone, to, illness,

passing, through, the, city, each, year, via, the, zanzibar, slave, trade, european, slave, trade, in, the, indian, ocean, began, when, portugal, established, estado, da, ndia, in, the, early, 16th, century, until, the, 1830s, c, 200, slaves, were, exported, from, mozambique, annually, and, similar, figures, have, been, estimated, for, slaves, brought, from, asia, to, the, philippines, during, the, iberian, union, 1580, 1640, the, establishment, of, the, dutch, east, india, company, in, the, early, 17th, century, led, to, a, quick, increase, in, volume, of, the, slave, trade, in, the, region, there, were, perhaps, up, to, 500, 000, slaves, in, various, dutch, colonies, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, in, the, indian, ocean, for, example, some, 4000, african, slaves, were, used, to, build, the, colombo, fortress, in, dutch, ceylon, bali, and, neighbouring, islands, supplied, regional, networks, with, c, 100, 000, 150, 000, slaves, 1620, 1830, indian, and, chinese,

mascarene, islands, a, number, which, reached, 133, 000, in, 1807, the, british, captured, the, islands, in, 1810, however, and, because, the, british, had, prohibited, the, slave, trade, in, 1807, a, system, of, clandestine, slave, trade, developed, to, bring, slaves, to, french, planters, on, the, islands, in, all, 336, 000, 388, 000, slaves, were, exported, to, the, mascarane, islands, from, 1670, to, 1848, in, all, europeans, traders, exported, 567, 900, 733, 200, slaves, within, the, indian, ocean, between, 1500, and, 1850, and, almost, as, many, from, the, indian, ocean, to, the, americas, during, the, same, period, slave, trade, in, the, indian, ocean, was, nevertheless, very, limited, compared, to, the, c, 12, 000, 000, slaves, exported, across, the, atlantic, the, atlantic, slave, trade, or, transatlantic, slave, trade, took, place, across, the, atlantic, ocean, from, the, 15th, through, to, the, 19th, centuries, according, to, patrick, manning, the, atlantic, slave, trade, was, significant, in, transforming, africans, from, a, minority, of, the, global, population, of, slaves, in, 1600, into, the, overwhelming, majority, by, 1800, by, 1850, the, number, of, african, slaves, within, africa, exceeded, those, in, the, americas, the, slave, trade, was, transformed, from, a, marginal, aspect, of, the, economies, into, the, largest, sector, in, a, relatively, short, span, in, addition, agricultural, plantations, increased, significantly, and, became, a, key, aspect, in, many, societies, economic, urban, centers, that, served, as, the, root, of, main, trade, routes, shifted, towards, the, west, coast, at, the, same, time, many, african, communities, relocated, far, away, from, slave, trade, routes, often, protecting, themselves, from, the, atlantic, slave, trade, but, hindering, economic, and, technological, development, at, the, same, time, in, many, african, societies, traditional, lineage, slavery, became, more, like, chattel, slavery, due, to, an, increased, work, demand, this, resulted, in, a, general, decrease, in, quality, of, life, working, conditions, and, status, of, slaves, in, west, african, societies, assimilative, slavery, was, increasingly, replaced, with, chattel, slavery, assimilitave, slavery, in, africa, often, allowed, eventual, freedom, and, also, significant, cultural, social, and, or, economic, influence, slaves, were, often, treated, as, part, of, their, owner, s, family, rather, than, simply, property, the, distribution, of, sex, among, enslaved, peoples, under, traditional, lineage, slavery, saw, women, as, more, desirable, slaves, due, to, demands, for, domestic, labour, and, for, reproductive, reasons, male, slaves, were, used, for, more, physical, agricultural, labour, but, as, more, enslaved, men, were, taken, to, the, west, coast, and, across, the, atlantic, to, the, new, world, female, slaves, were, increasingly, used, for, physical, and, agricultural, labour, and, polygyny, also, increased, chattel, slavery, in, america, was, highly, demanding, because, of, the, physical, nature, of, plantation, work, and, this, was, the, most, common, destination, for, male, slaves, in, the, new, world, it, has, been, argued, that, a, decrease, in, able, bodied, people, as, a, result, of, the, atlantic, slave, trade, limited, many, societies, ability, to, cultivate, land, and, develop, many, scholars, argue, that, the, transatlantic, slave, trade, left, africa, underdeveloped, demographically, unbalanced, and, vulnerable, to, future, european, colonization, the, first, europeans, to, arrive, on, the, coast, of, guinea, were, the, portuguese, the, first, european, to, actually, buy, enslaved, africans, in, the, region, of, guinea, was, ant, o, gon, alves, a, portuguese, explorer, in, 1441, ad, originally, interested, in, trading, mainly, for, gold, and, spices, they, set, up, colonies, on, the, uninhabited, islands, of, s, o, tom, in, the, 16th, century, the, portuguese, settlers, found, that, these, volcanic, islands, were, ideal, for, growing, sugar, sugar, growing, is, a, labour, intensive, undertaking, and, portuguese, settlers, were, difficult, to, attract, due, to, the, heat, lack, of, infrastructure, and, hard, life, to, cultivate, the, sugar, the, portuguese, turned, to, large, numbers, of, enslaved, africans, elmina, castle, on, the, gold, coast, originally, built, by, african, labour, for, the, portuguese, in, 1482, to, control, the, gold, trade, became, an, important, depot, for, slaves, that, were, to, be, transported, to, the, new, world, the, spanish, were, the, first, europeans, to, use, enslaved, africans, in, america, on, islands, such, as, cuba, and, hispaniola, where, the, alarming, death, rate, in, the, native, population, had, spurred, the, first, royal, laws, protecting, the, native, population, laws, of, burgos, 1512, 13, the, first, enslaved, africans, arrived, in, hispaniola, in, 1501, soon, after, the, papal, bull, of, 1493, gave, almost, all, of, the, new, world, to, spain, in, igboland, for, example, the, aro, oracle, the, igbo, religious, authority, began, condemning, more, people, to, slavery, due, to, small, infractions, that, previously, probably, wouldn, t, have, been, punishable, by, slavery, thus, increasing, the, number, of, enslaved, men, available, for, purchase, the, atlantic, slave, trade, peaked, in, the, late, 18th, century, when, the, largest, number, of, people, were, bought, or, captured, from, west, africa, and, taken, to, the, americas, the, increase, of, demand, for, slaves, due, to, the, expansion, of, european, colonial, powers, to, the, new, world, made, the, slave, trade, much, more, lucrative, to, the, west, african, powers, leading, to, the, establishment, of, a, number, of, actual, west, african, empires, thriving, on, slave, trade, these, included, the, bono, state, oyo, empire, yoruba, kong, empire, imamate, of, futa, jallon, imamate, of, futa, toro, kingdom, of, koya, kingdom, of, khasso, kingdom, of, kaabu, fante, confederacy, ashanti, confederacy, and, the, kingdom, of, dahomey, these, kingdoms, relied, on, a, militaristic, culture, of, constant, warfare, to, generate, the, great, numbers, of, human, captives, required, for, trade, with, the, europeans, it, is, documented, in, the, slave, trade, debates, of, england, in, the, early, 19th, century, all, the, old, writers, concur, in, stating, not, only, that, wars, are, entered, into, for, the, sole, purpose, of, making, slaves, but, that, they, are, fomented, by, europeans, with, a, view, to, that, object, the, gradual, abolition, of, slavery, in, european, colonial, empires, during, the, 19th, century, again, led, to, the, decline, and, collapse, of, these, african, empires, when, european, powers, began, to, stop, the, atlantic, slave, trade, this, caused, a, further, change, in, that, large, holders, of, slaves, in, africa, began, to, exploit, enslaved, people, on, plantations, and, other, agricultural, products, the, final, major, transformation, of, slave, relationships, came, with, the, inconsistent, emancipation, efforts, starting, in, the, mid, 19th, century, as, european, authorities, began, to, take, over, large, parts, of, inland, africa, starting, in, the, 1870s, the, colonial, policies, were, often, confusing, on, the, issue, for, example, even, when, slavery, was, deemed, illegal, colonial, authorities, would, return, escaped, slaves, to, their, masters, slavery, persisted, in, some, countries, under, colonial, rule, and, in, some, instances, it, was, not, until, independence, that, slavery, practices, were, significantly, transformed, anti, colonial, struggles, in, africa, often, brought, slaves, and, former, slaves, together, with, masters, and, former, masters, to, fight, for, independence, however, this, cooperation, was, short, lived, and, following, independence, political, parties, would, often, form, based, upon, the, stratifications, of, slaves, and, masters, in, some, parts, of, africa, slavery, and, slavery, like, practices, continue, to, this, day, particularly, the, illegal, trafficking, of, women, and, children, the, problem, has, proven, to, be, difficult, for, governments, and, civil, society, to, eliminate, efforts, by, europeans, against, slavery, and, the, slave, trade, began, in, the, late, 18th, century, and, had, a, large, impact, on, slavery, in, africa, portugal, was, the, first, country, in, the, continent, to, abolish, slavery, in, metropolitan, portugal, and, portuguese, india, by, a, bill, issued, on, 12, february, 1761, but, this, did, not, affect, their, colonies, in, brazil, and, africa, france, abolished, slavery, in, 1794, however, slavery, was, again, allowed, by, napoleon, in, 1802, and, not, abolished, for, good, until, 1848, in, 1803, denmark, norway, became, the, first, country, from, europe, to, implement, a, ban, on, the, slave, trade, slavery, itself, was, not, banned, until, 1848, britain, followed, in, 1807, with, the, passage, of, the, abolition, of, the, slave, trade, act, by, parliament, this, law, allowed, stiff, fines, increasing, with, the, number, of, slaves, transported, for, captains, of, slave, ships, britain, followed, this, with, the, slavery, abolition, act, 1833, which, freed, all, slaves, in, the, british, empire, british, pressure, on, other, countries, resulted, in, them, agreeing, to, end, the, slave, trade, from, africa, for, example, the, 1820, u, s, law, on, slave, trade, made, slave, trading, piracy, punishable, by, death, in, addition, the, ottoman, empire, abolished, slave, trade, from, africa, in, 1847, under, british, pressure, by, 1850, the, year, that, the, last, major, atlantic, slave, trade, participant, brazil, passed, the, eus, bio, de, queir, s, law, banning, the, slave, trade, the, slave, trades, had, been, significantly, slowed, and, in, general, only, illegal, trade, went, on, brazil, continued, the, practice, of, slavery, and, was, a, major, source, for, illegal, trade, until, about, 1870, and, the, abolition, of, slavery, became, permanent, in, 1888, when, princess, isabel, of, brazil, and, minister, rodrigo, silva, son, in, law, of, senator, eusebio, de, queiroz, banned, the, practice, the, british, took, an, active, approach, to, stopping, the, illegal, atlantic, slave, trade, during, this, period, the, west, africa, squadron, was, credited, with, capturing, 1, 600, slave, ships, between, 1808, and, 1860, and, freeing, 150, 000, africans, who, were, aboard, these, ships, action, was, also, taken, against, african, leaders, who, refused, to, agree, to, british, treaties, to, outlaw, the, trade, for, example, against, the, usurping, king, of, lagos, deposed, in, 1851, anti, slavery, treaties, were, signed, with, over, 50, african, rulers, according, to, patrick, manning, internal, slavery, was, most, important, to, africa, in, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, stating, if, there, is, any, time, when, one, can, speak, of, african, societies, being, organized, around, a, slave, mode, production, was, it, the, abolition, of, the, atlantic, slave, trade, resulted, in, the, economies, of, african, states, dependent, on, the, trade, being, reorganized, towards, domestic, plantation, slavery, and, legitimate, commerce, worked, by, slave, labour, slavery, before, this, period, was, generally, domestic, the, continuing, anti, slavery, movement, in, europe, became, an, excuse, and, a, casus, belli, for, the, european, conquest, and, colonization, of, much, of, the, african, continent, it, was, the, central, theme, of, the, brussels, anti, slavery, conference, 1889, 90, in, the, late, 19th, century, the, scramble, for, africa, saw, the, continent, rapidly, divided, between, imperialistic, european, powers, and, an, early, but, secondary, focus, of, all, colonial, regimes, was, the, suppression, of, slavery, and, the, slave, trade, seymour, drescher, argues, that, european, interests, in, abolition, were, primarily, motivated, by, economic, and, imperial, goals, despite, slavery, often, being, a, justification, behind, conquest, colonial, regimes, often, ignored, slavery, or, allowed, slavery, practices, to, continue, this, was, because, the, colonial, state, depended, on, the, cooperation, of, indigenous, political, and, economic, structures, which, were, heavily, involved, in, slavery, as, a, result, early, colonial, policies, usually, sought, to, end, slave, trading, while, regulating, existing, slave, practices, and, weakening, the, power, of, slave, masters, furthermore, the, early, colonial, states, had, weak, effective, control, over, their, territories, which, precluded, efforts, to, widespread, abolition, abolition, attempts, became, more, concrete, later, during, the, colonial, period, there, were, many, causes, for, the, decline, and, abolition, of, slavery, in, africa, during, the, colonial, period, including, colonial, abolition, policies, various, economic, changes, and, slave, resistance, the, economic, changes, during, the, colonial, period, including, the, rise, of, wage, labour, and, cash, crops, hastened, the, decline, of, slavery, by, offering, new, economic, opportunities, to, slaves, the, abolition, of, slave, raiding, and, the, end, of, wars, between, african, states, drastically, reduced, the, supply, of, slaves, slaves, would, take, advantage, of, early, colonial, laws, that, nominally, abolished, slavery, and, would, migrate, away, from, their, masters, although, these, laws, often, were, intended, to, regulate, slavery, more, than, actually, abolish, it, this, migration, led, to, more, concrete, abolition, efforts, by, colonial, governments, following, conquest, and, abolition, by, the, french, over, a, million, slaves, in, french, west, africa, fled, from, their, masters, to, earlier, homes, between, 1906, and, 1911, in, madagascar, over, 500, 000, slaves, were, freed, following, french, abolition, in, 1896, in, response, to, this, pressure, ethiopia, officially, abolished, slavery, in, 1932, the, sokoto, caliphate, abolished, slavery, in, 1900, and, the, rest, of, the, sahel, in, 1911, after, the, end, of, the, trans, atlantic, slave, trade, other, slave, trade, routes, transporting, enslaved, people, from, africa, continued, in, to, the, 20th, century, the, indian, ocean, slave, trade, including, the, zanzibar, slave, trade, was, combatted, by, the, british, in, a, number, of, anti, slaveery, treaties, pressued, by, the, british, upon, the, sultanate, of, zanzibar, between, 1822, and, 1909, each, one, limiting, the, slave, trade, between, the, swaihili, coast, of, east, africa, and, the, arabian, peninsula, in, an, 1867, agreement, with, the, british, zanzibar, was, pressured, to, ban, the, export, of, slaves, to, arabia, and, to, limit, the, slave, trade, within, the, borders, of, the, sultanate, to, only, between, latitude, 9, degrees, south, of, kilwa, and, latitude, 4, degrees, south, of, lamu, after, 1867, the, british, campaign, against, the, slave, trade, in, the, indian, ocean, was, undermined, by, omani, slave, dhows, using, french, colours, trafficking, slaves, to, arabia, and, the, persian, gulf, from, east, africa, as, far, south, as, mozambique, which, the, french, tolerated, until, 1905, when, the, hague, international, tribunal, mandated, france, to, curtail, french, flags, to, omani, dhows, nevertheless, small, scale, smuggling, of, slaves, from, east, africa, to, arabia, continued, until, the, 1960s, during, the, 20th, century, the, issue, of, slavery, was, addressed, by, the, league, of, nations, which, founded, commissions, to, investigate, and, eradicate, the, institution, of, slavery, and, slave, trade, worldwide, the, temporary, slavery, commission, tsc, conducted, a, global, investigation, in, 1924, 1926, and, filed, a, report, and, a, convention, 1926, slavery, convention, was, drawn, up, to, hasten, the, total, abolition, of, slavery, and, the, slave, trade, in, 1932, the, league, formed, the, committee, of, experts, on, slavery, ces, to, review, the, result, and, enforcement, of, the, 1926, slavery, convention, which, resulted, in, a, new, international, investigation, under, the, first, permanent, slavery, committee, the, advisory, committee, of, experts, on, slavery, ace, both, of, these, investigations, noted, that, african, slaves, were, transported, from, africa, to, the, muslim, arab, world, where, chattel, slavery, were, still, legal, the, trans, saharan, slave, trade, was, combatted, by, the, colonial, authorities, who, nominally, controlled, the, territories, of, the, sahara, desert, from, the, late, 19th, century, onward, both, the, french, spanish, italian, and, british, colonial, authorities, officially, stated, that, they, combatted, the, ancient, slave, trade, transporting, enslaved, africans, across, the, sahara, to, arab, north, africa, and, the, middle, east, in, reality, however, the, colonial, authorities, of, the, west, had, little, actual, control, over, the, sahara, territories, and, were, not, able, to, actually, combat, the, slave, trade, in, practice, though, it, did, gradually, limit, the, trade, the, colonial, authorities, stated, that, the, slave, trade, were, still, active, in, the, 1930s, though, it, was, actively, combatted, the, italians, reported, to, the, advisory, committee, of, experts, on, slavery, in, the, 1930s, that, the, trans, saharan, slave, trade, had, been, erased, in, parallel, with, italian, conquest, during, which, 900, slaves, had, been, freed, in, the, kufra, slave, market, and, in, the, 1936, report, to, the, advisory, committee, of, experts, on, slavery, the, french, british, and, italian, stated, that, they, all, surveyed, the, water, sources, along, the, caravan, routes, in, the, sahara, to, combat, the, trans, saharan, slave, trade, from, nigeria, to, north, africa, the, 1937, report, to, the, advisory, committee, of, experts, on, slavery, both, france, and, spain, assured, that, they, actively, fought, the, slave, raids, from, the, trans, saharan, slave, traders, and, in, 1938, the, french, claimed, that, they, had, secured, control, over, the, border, areas, alongside, morocco, and, algeria, and, effectively, prevented, the, trans, saharan, slave, trade, in, that, area, the, ancient, red, sea, slave, trade, which, transported, enslaved, africans, to, the, arabian, peninsula, across, the, red, sea, continued, until, the, 1960s, the, annual, pilgrimage, to, mecca, the, hajj, was, a, big, vehicle, for, enslavement, muslim, african, hajj, pilgrims, across, the, sahara, were, duped, or, given, low, cost, travel, expenses, by, tribal, leaders, when, they, arrived, at, the, east, coast, they, were, trafficked, over, the, red, sea, in, the, dhows, of, the, red, sea, slave, trade, or, on, small, passenger, planes, and, discovered, upon, arrival, in, saudi, arabia, that, they, were, to, be, sold, on, the, slave, market, rather, than, to, perform, the, hajj, the, english, traveller, charles, m, doughty, who, visited, central, arabia, in, the, 1880s, noted, that, african, slaves, were, brought, up, to, arabia, every, year, during, the, hajj, and, that, there, are, bondsmen, and, bondwomen, and, free, negro, families, in, every, tribe, and, town, slavery, in, islamic, societies, has, been, described, as, a, benevolent, institution, and, king, abd, al, aziz, ibn, saud, remarked, to, the, british, legation, officer, munshi, ihsanullah, that, west, africans, lived, like, beasts, that, they, were, much, better, off, as, slaves, and, that, if, he, had, his, way, he, would, take, all, west, african, pilgrims, as, his, slaves, raising, them, thus, out, of, their, depraved, state, and, turning, them, into, happy, prosperous, and, civilised, beings, the, red, sea, slave, trade, was, combatted, by, particular, the, british, who, tried, to, control, the, pilgrim, travellers, through, africa, and, patrolled, the, red, sea, and, controll, the, traffic, but, these, controls, were, not, effective, since, the, slave, traders, would, inform, the, european, colonial, authorities, that, the, slaves, were, their, wives, children, servants, or, fellow, hajj, pilgrims, and, the, victims, themselves, were, convinced, of, the, same, unaware, that, they, were, being, shipped, as, slaves, article, 4, of, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, adopted, in, 1948, by, the, un, general, assembly, explicitly, banned, slavery, after, world, war, ii, chattel, slavery, was, formally, abolished, by, law, in, almost, the, entire, world, with, the, exception, of, the, arabian, peninsula, and, some, parts, of, africa, chattel, slavery, was, still, legal, in, saudi, arabia, in, yemen, in, the, trucial, states, and, in, oman, and, slaves, were, supplied, to, the, arabian, peninsula, via, the, red, sea, slave, trade, when, the, league, of, nations, was, succeeded, by, the, united, nations, un, after, world, war, ii, charles, wilton, wood, greenidge, of, the, anti, slavery, international, worked, for, the, un, to, continue, the, investigation, of, global, slavery, conducted, by, the, ace, of, the, league, and, in, february, 1950, the, ad, hoc, committee, on, slavery, of, the, united, nations, was, inaugurated, which, ultimately, resulted, in, the, introduction, of, the, supplementary, convention, on, the, abolition, of, slavery, slavery, in, saudi, arabia, yemen, and, the, united, arab, emirates, did, not, end, until, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, in, the, 21st, century, activists, contend, that, many, immigrants, who, travel, to, those, countries, for, work, are, held, in, virtual, slavery, under, the, kafala, system, colonial, nations, were, mostly, successful, in, their, aim, to, abolish, slavery, though, slavery, is, still, very, active, in, africa, even, though, it, has, gradually, moved, to, a, wage, economy, independent, nations, attempting, to, westernize, or, impress, europe, sometimes, cultivated, an, image, of, slavery, suppression, even, as, they, in, the, case, of, egypt, hired, european, soldiers, like, samuel, white, baker, s, expedition, up, the, nile, slavery, has, never, been, eradicated, in, africa, and, it, commonly, appears, in, african, states, such, as, chad, ethiopia, mali, niger, and, sudan, in, places, where, law, and, order, have, collapsed, although, outlawed, in, all, countries, today, slavery, is, practised, in, secret, in, many, parts, of, the, world, there, are, an, estimated, 30, million, victims, of, slavery, worldwide, in, mauritania, alone, up, to, 600, 000, men, women, and, children, or, 20, of, the, population, are, enslaved, many, of, them, used, as, bonded, labour, slavery, in, mauritania, was, finally, criminalized, in, august, 2007, during, the, second, sudanese, civil, war, people, were, taken, into, slavery, estimates, of, abductions, range, from, 14, 000, to, 200, 000, in, niger, where, the, practice, of, slavery, was, outlawed, in, 2003, a, study, found, that, almost, 8, of, the, population, are, still, slaves, slavery, and, the, slave, trades, had, a, significant, impact, on, the, size, of, the, population, and, the, gender, distribution, throughout, much, of, africa, the, precise, impact, of, these, demographic, shifts, has, been, an, issue, of, significant, debate, the, atlantic, slave, trade, took, 70, 000, people, per, year, primarily, from, the, west, coast, of, africa, at, its, peak, in, the, mid, 1700s, the, trans, saharan, slave, trade, involved, the, capture, of, peoples, from, the, continental, interior, who, were, then, shipped, overseas, through, ports, on, the, red, sea, and, elsewhere, it, peaked, at, 10, 000, people, bartered, per, year, in, the, 1600s, according, to, patrick, manning, there, was, a, consistent, population, decrease, in, large, parts, of, sub, saharan, africa, as, a, result, of, these, slave, trades, this, population, decline, throughout, west, africa, from, 1650, to, 1850, was, exacerbated, by, the, preference, of, slave, traders, for, male, slaves, this, preference, only, existed, in, the, transatlantic, slave, trade, more, female, slaves, than, male, were, traded, across, the, continent, of, africa, in, eastern, africa, the, slave, trade, was, multi, directional, and, changed, over, time, to, meet, the, demand, for, menial, labour, zanj, slaves, captured, from, the, southern, interior, were, sold, through, ports, on, the, northern, seaboard, in, cumulatively, large, numbers, over, the, centuries, to, customers, in, the, nile, valley, horn, of, africa, arabian, peninsula, persian, gulf, india, far, east, and, the, indian, ocean, islands, the, extent, of, slavery, within, africa, and, the, trade, in, slaves, to, other, regions, is, not, known, precisely, although, the, atlantic, slave, trade, has, been, best, studied, estimates, range, from, 8, million, people, to, 20, million, the, trans, atlantic, slave, trade, database, estimates, that, the, atlantic, slave, trade, took, around, 12, 8, million, people, between, 1450, and, 1900, the, slave, trade, across, the, sahara, and, red, sea, from, the, sahara, the, horn, of, africa, and, east, africa, has, been, estimated, at, 6, 2, million, people, between, 600, and, 1600, although, the, rate, decreased, from, east, africa, in, the, 1700s, it, increased, in, the, 1800s, and, is, estimated, at, 1, 65, million, for, that, century, estimates, by, patrick, manning, are, that, about, 12, million, slaves, entered, the, atlantic, trade, between, the, 16th, and, 19th, century, but, about, 1, 5, million, died, on, board, ship, about, 10, 5, million, slaves, arrived, in, the, americas, besides, the, slaves, who, died, on, the, middle, passage, more, africans, likely, died, during, the, wars, and, slave, raids, within, africa, and, forced, marches, to, ports, manning, estimates, that, 4, million, died, inside, africa, after, capture, and, many, more, died, young, manning, s, estimate, covers, the, 12, million, who, were, originally, destined, for, the, atlantic, as, well, as, the, 6, million, destined, for, asian, slave, markets, and, the, 8, million, destined, for, african, markets, according, to, david, stannard, 50, of, deaths, in, africa, occurred, as, a, result, of, wars, between, native, kingdoms, which, produced, the, majority, of, slaves, this, includes, those, who, died, in, battles, and, those, who, died, as, a, result, of, forced, marches, to, slave, ports, on, the, coast, the, practice, of, enslaving, enemy, combatants, and, their, villages, was, widespread, throughout, western, and, west, central, africa, although, wars, were, rarely, started, to, procure, slaves, the, slave, trade, was, largely, a, by, product, of, tribal, and, state, warfare, as, a, way, of, removing, potential, dissidents, after, victory, or, financing, future, wars, the, demographic, effects, of, the, slave, trade, are, some, of, the, most, controversial, and, debated, issues, walter, rodney, argued, that, the, export, of, so, many, people, had, been, a, demographic, disaster, and, had, left, africa, permanently, disadvantaged, when, compared, to, other, parts, of, the, world, and, that, this, largely, explains, that, continent, s, continued, poverty, he, presents, numbers, that, show, that, africa, s, population, stagnated, during, this, period, while, that, of, europe, and, asia, grew, dramatically, according, to, rodney, all, other, areas, of, the, economy, were, disrupted, by, the, slave, trade, as, the, top, merchants, abandoned, traditional, industries, to, pursue, slaving, and, the, lower, levels, of, the, population, were, disrupted, by, the, slaving, itself, others, have, challenged, this, view, j, d, fage, compared, the, number, effect, on, the, continent, as, a, whole, david, eltis, has, compared, the, numbers, to, the, rate, of, emigration, from, europe, during, this, period, in, the, 19th, century, alone, over, 50, million, people, left, europe, for, the, americas, a, far, higher, rate, than, were, ever, taken, from, africa, others, in, turn, challenged, that, view, joseph, e, inikori, argues, the, history, of, the, region, shows, that, the, effects, were, still, quite, deleterious, he, argues, that, the, african, economic, model, of, the, period, was, very, different, from, the, european, and, could, not, sustain, such, population, losses, population, reductions, in, certain, areas, also, led, to, widespread, problems, inikori, also, notes, that, after, the, suppression, of, the, slave, trade, africa, s, population, almost, immediately, began, to, rapidly, increase, even, prior, to, the, introduction, of, modern, medicines, there, is, a, longstanding, debate, among, analysts, and, scholars, about, the, destructive, impacts, of, the, slave, trades, it, is, often, claimed, that, the, slave, trade, undermined, local, economies, and, political, stability, as, villages, vital, labour, forces, were, shipped, overseas, as, slave, raids, and, civil, wars, became, commonplace, with, the, rise, of, a, large, commercial, slave, trade, driven, by, european, needs, enslaving, your, enemy, became, less, a, consequence, of, war, and, more, and, more, a, reason, to, go, to, war, the, slave, trade, was, claimed, to, have, impeded, the, formation, of, larger, ethnic, groups, causing, ethnic, factionalism, and, weakening, the, formation, for, stable, political, structures, in, many, places, it, also, is, claimed, to, have, reduced, the, mental, health, and, social, development, of, african, people, in, contrast, to, these, arguments, j, d, fage, asserts, that, slavery, did, not, have, a, wholly, disastrous, effect, on, the, societies, of, africa, slaves, were, an, expensive, commodity, and, traders, received, a, great, deal, in, exchange, for, each, enslaved, person, at, the, peak, of, the, slave, trade, hundreds, of, thousands, of, muskets, vast, quantities, of, cloth, gunpowder, and, metals, were, being, shipped, to, guinea, most, of, this, money, was, spent, on, european, made, firearms, of, very, poor, quality, and, industrial, grade, alcohol, african, trade, with, europe, at, the, peak, of, the, atlantic, slave, trade, which, also, included, significant, exports, of, gold, and, ivory, was, some, 3, 5, million, pounds, sterling, per, year, by, contrast, the, total, trade, of, the, kingdom, of, great, britain, an, economic, superpower, of, the, time, was, about, 14, million, pounds, per, year, over, this, same, period, of, the, late, 18th, century, as, patrick, manning, has, pointed, out, the, vast, majority, of, items, traded, for, slaves, were, common, rather, than, luxury, goods, textiles, iron, ore, currency, and, salt, were, some, of, the, most, important, commodities, imported, as, a, result, of, the, slave, trade, and, these, goods, were, spread, within, the, entire, society, raising, the, general, standard, of, living, although, debated, it, is, argued, that, the, atlantic, slave, trade, devastated, the, african, economy, in, 19th, century, yoruba, land, economic, activity, was, described, to, be, at, its, lowest, ever, while, life, and, property, were, being, taken, daily, and, normal, living, was, in, jeopardy, because, of, the, fear, of, being, kidnapped, onwumah, imhonopi, adetunde, 2019, slave, trade, in, africa, has, also, caused, disruption, of, political, systems, to, elaborate, on, the, disruption, of, political, systems, caused, by, slavery, in, africa, the, capture, and, sale, of, millions, of, africans, to, the, americas, and, elsewhere, resulted, in, the, loss, of, many, skilled, and, talented, individuals, who, played, important, roles, in, african, societies, without, these, people, african, societies, were, destabilized, and, their, political, systems, became, weaker, this, led, to, instability, and, civil, conflicts, with, some, societies, collapsing, altogether, additionally, the, slave, trade, encouraged, warfare, and, raiding, as, people, were, captured, and, sold, by, rival, african, tribes, the, impact, of, the, slave, trade, on, african, political, systems, was, far, reaching, and, enduring, today, many, african, countries, continue, to, face, political, instability, and, weak, governance, with, some, scholars, pointing, to, the, legacy, of, slavery, as, a, contributing, factor, a, study, of, the, relationship, between, the, number, of, slaves, exported, and, current, wealth, found, that, the, areas, most, affected, by, the, slave, trade, are, among, the, poorest, today, indicating, the, slave, trade, s, long, lasting, detrimental, effects, especially, on, the, affected, regions, karl, marx, in, his, economic, history, of, capitalism, das, kapital, claimed, that, the, turning, of, africa, into, a, warren, for, the, commercial, hunting, of, black, skins, signalled, the, rosy, dawn, of, the, era, of, capitalist, production, he, argued, that, the, slave, trade, was, part, of, what, he, termed, the, primitive, accumulation, of, european, capital, the, non, capitalist, accumulation, of, wealth, that, preceded, and, created, the, financial, conditions, for, western, europe, s, industrialization, and, the, advent, of, the, capitalist, mode, of, production, eric, williams, has, written, about, the, contribution, of, africans, on, the, basis, of, profits, from, the, slave, trade, and, slavery, arguing, that, the, employment, of, those, profits, were, used, to, help, finance, britain, s, industrialization, he, argues, that, the, enslavement, of, africans, was, an, essential, element, to, the, industrial, revolution, and, that, european, wealth, was, in, part, a, result, of, slavery, but, that, by, the, time, of, its, abolition, it, had, lost, its, profitability, and, it, was, in, the, economic, interest, of, various, european, governments, to, ban, it, joseph, inikori, has, written, that, slavery, in, the, british, west, indies, was, more, profitable, than, the, critics, of, williams, believe, other, researchers, and, historians, have, strongly, contested, what, has, come, to, be, referred, to, as, the, williams, thesis, in, academia, david, richardson, has, concluded, that, the, profits, from, the, british, slave, trade, and, slavery, amounted, to, less, than, 1, of, domestic, investment, in, britain, and, economic, historian, stanley, engerman, notes, that, even, without, subtracting, the, associated, costs, of, the, slave, trade, e, g, shipping, costs, slave, mortality, mortality, of, europeans, in, africa, defence, costs, or, reinvestment, of, profits, back, into, the, slave, trade, the, total, profits, from, the, slave, trade, and, of, west, indian, plantations, amounted, to, less, than, 5, of, the, british, economy, during, any, year, of, the, industrial, revolution, historian, richard, pares, in, an, article, written, before, williams, book, dismisses, the, influence, of, wealth, generated, from, the, west, indian, plantations, upon, the, financing, of, the, industrial, revolution, stating, that, whatever, substantial, flow, of, investment, from, west, indian, profits, into, industry, there, was, occurred, after, emancipation, not, before, findlay, and, o, rourke, noted, that, the, figures, presented, by, o, brien, 1982, to, back, his, claim, that, the, periphery, was, peripheral, suggest, the, opposite, with, profits, from, the, periphery, 1784, 1786, being, 5, 66, million, when, there, was, 10, 30, million, total, gross, investment, in, the, british, economy, and, similar, proportions, for, 1824, 1826, they, note, that, dismissing, the, profits, of, the, enslavement, of, human, beings, from, significance, because, it, was, a, small, share, of, national, income, could, be, used, to, argue, that, there, was, no, industrial, revolution, since, modern, industry, provided, only, a, small, share, of, national, income, and, that, it, is, a, mistake, to, assume, that, small, size, is, the, same, as, small, significance, findlay, and, o, rourke, also, note, that, the, share, of, american, export, commodities, produced, by, enslaved, human, beings, rose, from, 54, between, 1501, and, 1550, to, 82, 5, between, 1761, and, 1780, seymour, drescher, and, robert, anstey, argue, the, slave, trade, remained, profitable, until, abolition, because, of, innovations, in, agriculture, and, that, moralistic, reform, not, economic, incentive, was, primarily, responsible, for, abolition, a, similar, debate, has, taken, place, about, other, european, nations, the, french, slave, trade, it, is, argued, was, more, profitable, than, alternative, domestic, investments, and, probably, encouraged, capital, accumulation, before, the, industrial, revolution, and, napoleonic, wars, maulana, karenga, states, the, effects, of, the, atlantic, slave, trade, in, african, captives, he, morally, monstrous, destruction, of, human, possibility, involved, redefining, african, humanity, to, the, world, poisoning, past, present, and, future, relations, with, others, who, only, know, us, through, this, stereotyping, and, thus, damaging, the, truly, human, relations, among, people, of, today, he, says, that, it, constituted, the, destruction, of, culture, language, religion, and, human, possibility
