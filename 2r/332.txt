during, the, 12th, and, 13th, centuries, rivalry, between, these, two, parties, dominated, political, life, across, medieval, italy, the, struggle, for, power, between, the, papacy, and, the, holy, roman, empire, arose, with, the, investiture, controversy, which, began, in, 1075, and, ended, with, the, concordat, of, worms, in, 1122, timeline, the, conflict, between, guelphs, and, ghibellines, arose, from, the, political, divisions, caused, by, the, investiture, controversy, about, whether, secular, rulers, or, the, pope, had, the, authority, to, appoint, bishops, and, abbots, upon, the, death, of, emperor, henry, v, of, the, salian, dynasty, the, dukes, elected, an, opponent, of, his, dynasty, lothair, iii, as, the, new, emperor, this, displeased, the, house, of, hohenstaufen, who, were, allied, with, and, related, to, the, old, dynasty, out, of, fear, of, the, hohenstaufen, lothair, iii, placed, himself, under, the, pope, s, protection, to, this, end, he, ceded, all, imperial, rights, to, the, pope, under, henry, v, s, concordat, of, worms, war, then, broke, out, in, germany, between, those, who, supported, the, hohenstaufen, and, those, who, were, aligned, to, lothair,

of, bavaria, as, well, as, henry, the, lion, the, welfs, were, said, to, have, used, the, name, as, a, rallying, cry, during, the, siege, of, weinsberg, in, 1140, in, which, the, rival, hohenstaufens, led, by, conrad, iii, used, wibellingen, the, name, of, a, castle, today, known, as, waiblingen, as, their, cry, wibellingen, subsequently, became, ghibellino, in, italian, thus, the, hohenstaufen, faction, became, known, as, the, ghibellines, and, the, welfs, eventually, became, known, as, the, guelphs, the, ghibellines, were, the, imperial, party, while, the, guelphs, supported, the, pope, cities, more, directly, threatened, by, the, enlargement, of, the, papal, states, tended, to, align, with, the, ghibelline, faction, while, the, cities, that, wanted, more, autonomy, from, the, empire, tended, to, belong, to, the, guelph, faction, the, clash, between, the, municipalities, of, northern, italy, and, imperial, power, originated, in, the, struggle, for, investitures, the, guelph, lombard, league, defeated, emperor, frederick, barbarossa, at, the, battle, of, legnano, in, 1176, frederick, recognized, the, full, autonomy, of, the, cities, of, the, lombard, league, under, his, nominal, suzerainty, the, conflict, between, the, two, factions, dominated, the, politics, of, medieval, italy, and, persisted, long, after, the, confrontation, between, emperor, and, pope, had, ceased, smaller, cities, tended, to, be, ghibelline, if, the, larger, city, nearby, was, guelph, for, example, guelph, republic, of, florence, and, ghibelline, republic, of, siena, faced, off, at, the, battle, of, montaperti, 1260, pisa, maintained, a, staunch, ghibelline, stance, against, her, fiercest, rivals, the, guelph, republic, of, genoa, and, florence, local, or, regional, political,

upheavals, the, conflicts, between, guelphs, and, ghibellines, ended, in, the, 14th, century, with, the, creation, of, a, new, situation, where, the, state, and, the, laity, began, to, withdraw, from, any, ecclesiastical, interference, at, the, beginning, of, the, 13th, century, philip, of, swabia, a, hohenstaufen, and, otto, of, brunswick, a, welf, were, rivals, for, the, imperial, throne, philip, was, supported, by, the, ghibellines, as, a, son, of, frederick, i, while, otto, was, supported, by, the, guelphs, although, the, guelphs, initially, succeeded, in, getting, otto, crowned, as, emperor, otto, turned, against, the, papacy, was, excommunicated, and, was, replaced, with, philip, s, heir, emperor, frederick, ii, frederick, ii, was, an, enemy, of, both, otto, and, the, papacy, and, during, frederick, s, reign, the, guelphs, became, more, strictly, associated, with, the, papacy, while, the, ghibellines, became, supporters, of, the, empire, and, frederick, in, particular, pope, gregory, ix, excommunicated, frederick, ii, in, 1227, for, failing, to, go, on, crusade, then, again, for, going, on, the, sixth, crusade, 1228, 1229, while, excommunicated, while, frederick, was, in, the, crusader, states, this, division, developed, there, and, his, regent, in, italy, fought, a, war, with, the, pope, that, war, was, ended, and, the, excommunication, was, lifted, in, 1230, but, the, hostility, continued, in, 1237, frederick, entered, italy, with, a, large, army, intending, to, subdue, the, defiant, cities, of, the, lombard, league, pope, gregory, tried, to, broker, a, peace, but, failed, frederick, defeated, the, league, at, cortenuova, and, refused, all, peace, offers, from, them, he, besieged, brescia, but, was, repulsed, in, 1239, frederick, was, again, excommunicated, by, pope, gregory, in, response, he, expelled, franciscan, and, the, dominican, friars, from, lombardy, and, made, his, son, enzo, imperial, vicar, in, italy, he, also, annexed, romagna, marche, the, duchy, of, spoleto, and, part, of, the, papal, states, and, marched, through, tuscany, hoping, to, capture, rome, he, was, forced, to, retreat, sacking, the, city, of, benevento, soon, the, ghibelline, city, of, ferrara, fell, and, frederick, once, more, advanced, capturing, ravenna, and, faenza, the, pope, convened, a, council, but, an, imperial, pisan, fleet, defeated, a, papal, fleet, carrying, cardinals, and, prelates, from, genoa, in, the, battle, of, giglio, frederick, approached, rome, meanwhile, pope, gregory, died, frederick, withdrew, his, forces, and, freed, two, cardinals, he, had, jailed, in, capua, however, frederick, marched, again, against, rome, throughout, 1242, and, 1243, a, new, pope, innocent, iv, was, elected, at, first, frederick, was, pleased, with, the, election, since, innocent, had, relatives, in, the, imperial, camp, however, the, new, pope, immediately, turned, against, frederick, when, the, city, of, viterbo, rebelled, the, pope, backed, the, guelphs, and, frederick, immediately, marched, to, italy, and, besieged, viterbo, the, pope, signed, a, peace, treaty, with, the, emperor, relieving, the, city, after, the, emperor, left, cardinal, raniero, capocci, leader, of, viterbo, had, the, garrison, massacred, the, pope, made, another, treaty, but, he, immediately, broke, it, and, continued, to, back, the, guelphs, the, pope, supported, henry, raspe, landgrave, of, thuringia, as, king, of, the, romans, and, soon, plotted, to, have, frederick, killed, after, an, attempted, assassination, failed, the, pope, fled, to, liguria, soon, the, tide, turned, against, the, imperial, party, the, lombard, city, of, parma, rebelled, enzo, who, had, not, been, present, asked, his, father, for, help, frederick, and, ezzelino, iii, da, romano, the, tyrant, of, verona, laid, siege, to, the, city, the, imperial, camp, was, ambushed, by, the, guelphs, and, in, the, ensuing, battle, of, parma, the, imperial, party, was, routed, losing, much, of, their, treasury, frederick, retreated, and, gathered, another, army, but, the, resistance, of, parma, encouraged, other, cities, to, rebel, and, frederick, was, powerless, to, do, anything, the, ghibellines, were, eventually, defeated, in, the, battle, of, fossalta, against, the, army, of, bologna, enzo, was, captured, and, imprisoned, until, his, death, although, the, ghibellines, started, recovering, defeating, the, guelphs, in, the, battle, of, cingoli, frederick, by, then, was, ill, by, the, time, he, died, his, son, conrad, iv, had, reconquered, much, of, his, possessions, this, brought, peace, to, italy, for, a, few, years, after, the, death, of, frederick, ii, in, 1250, the, ghibellines, were, supported, by, conrad, iv, and, later, king, manfred, of, sicily, the, guelphs, were, supported, by, charles, i, of, naples, the, ghibellines, of, siena, defeated, the, florentine, guelphs, at, the, battle, of, montaperti, 1260, after, the, hohenstaufen, dynasty, lost, the, empire, when, charles, i, executed, conradin, in, 1268, the, terms, guelph, and, ghibelline, became, associated, with, individual, families, and, cities, rather, than, with, the, conflict, between, empire, and, papacy, the, stronghold, of, italian, ghibellines, was, the, city, of, forl, in, romagna, that, city, remained, with, the, ghibelline, factions, partly, as, a, means, of, preserving, its, independence, rather, than, out, of, loyalty, to, the, temporal, power, as, forl, was, nominally, in, the, papal, states, over, the, centuries, the, papacy, tried, several, times, to, regain, control, of, forl, sometimes, by, violence, or, by, allurements, the, division, between, guelphs, and, ghibellines, was, especially, important, in, florence, the, two, factions, frequently, fought, each, other, over, power, in, many, other, northern, italian, cities, the, two, sides, were, now, fighting, either, against, german, influence, in, the, case, of, the, guelphs, or, against, the, temporal, power, of, the, pope, in, the, case, of, the, ghibellines, in, florence, and, elsewhere, the, guelphs, usually, included, merchants, and, burghers, while, the, ghibellines, tended, to, be, noblemen, to, identify, themselves, people, adopted, distinctive, customs, such, as, wearing, a, feather, on, a, particular, side, of, their, hats, or, cutting, fruit, a, particular, way, according, to, their, affiliation, the, conflict, between, guelphs, and, ghibellines, was, important, in, the, republic, of, genoa, where, the, former, were, called, rampini, lit, grappling, hooks, and, the, latter, mascherati, lit, masked, although, the, origin, of, these, terms, is, not, clear, local, families, like, fieschi, and, grimaldi, usually, sided, with, the, guelph, party, in, conflict, with, the, doria, and, some, branches, of, the, spinola, families, while, genoa, was, often, under, guelph, rule, in, the, early, years, of, the, 13th, century, in, 1270, ghibellines, oberto, spinola, and, oberto, doria, revolted, against, the, guelphs, and, established, a, separate, government, which, lasted, a, couple, of, decades, guelph, families, fled, to, their, strongholds, east, fieschi, and, west, grimaldi, they, were, forced, to, cease, their, resistance, after, several, military, campaigns, they, were, again, accepted, in, the, city, s, political, life, after, paying, war, expenses, after, the, tuscan, guelphs, finally, defeated, the, ghibellines, in, 1289, at, the, battle, of, campaldino, and, at, vicopisano, the, guelphs, began, infighting, by, 1300, the, florentine, guelphs, had, divided, into, the, black, and, white, guelphs, the, blacks, continued, to, support, the, papacy, while, the, whites, were, opposed, to, papal, influence, specifically, the, influence, of, pope, boniface, viii, dante, was, among, the, supporters, of, the, white, guelphs, in, 1302, he, was, exiled, when, the, black, guelphs, took, control, of, florence, those, who, were, not, connected, to, either, side, or, who, had, no, connections, to, either, guelphs, or, ghibellines, considered, both, factions, unworthy, of, support, but, were, still, affected, by, changes, of, power, in, their, respective, cities, emperor, henry, vii, was, disgusted, by, supporters, of, both, sides, when, he, visited, italy, in, 1310, in, 1325, the, city, states, of, guelph, bologna, and, ghibelline, modena, clashed, in, the, war, of, the, bucket, resulting, in, modena, s, victory, at, the, battle, of, zappolino, which, led, to, a, resurgence, of, ghibelline, fortunes, in, 1334, pope, benedict, xii, threatened, people, who, used, either, the, guelph, or, ghibelline, name, with, excommunication, the, term, ghibelline, continued, to, indicate, allegiance, to, the, declining, imperial, authority, in, italy, and, saw, a, brief, resurgence, during, the, italian, campaigns, of, emperors, henry, vii, 1310, and, louis, iv, 1327, since, the, pope, granted, sicily, southern, italy, to, the, french, prince, charles, i, of, anjou, the, guelphs, took, a, pro, french, stance, as, late, as, the, 16th, century, ghibellines, like, the, colonna, or, gonzaga, still, fought, for, charles, v, holy, roman, emperor, while, guelphs, like, the, orsini, and, este, still, fought, for, the, french, during, the, french, dominated, avignon, papacy, pope, john, xxii, who, supported, the, french, allied, king, john, of, bohemia, excommunicated, john, s, rival, emperor, louis, iv, in, 1324, and, threatened, heresy, charges, against, the, ghibellines, the, ghibellines, then, supported, louis, invasion, of, italy, and, coronation, as, king, of, italy, and, holy, roman, emperor, in, milan, the, guelphs, and, ghibellines, cooperated, in, the, creation, of, the, golden, ambrosian, republic, in, 1447, however, over, the, next, few, years, they, engaged, in, intense, disputes, after, the, initial, leadership, of, the, ghibellines, the, guelphs, seized, power, at, the, election, of, the, captains, and, defenders, of, the, liberty, of, milan, the, guelph, government, became, increasingly, autocratic, leading, to, a, ghibelline, conspiracy, led, by, giorgio, lampugnino, and, teodoro, bossi, it, failed, and, many, ghibellines, were, massacred, in, 1449, others, fled, including, the, prominent, ghibelline, vitaliano, i, borromeo, who, was, sheltered, in, his, county, of, arona, public, opinion, turned, against, the, guelphs, in, the, next, elections, the, ghibellines, were, briefly, victorious, but, were, deposed, after, imprisoning, guelph, leaders, giovanni, appiani, and, giovanni, ossona, after, francesco, i, sforza, was, made, duke, by, milan, s, senate, in, 1450, many, ghibellines, who, had, fled, such, as, filippo, borromeo, and, luisino, bossi, were, restored, to, positions, of, prominence, in, milan, in, the, 15th, century, the, guelphs, supported, charles, viii, of, france, during, his, invasion, of, italy, at, the, start, of, the, italian, wars, while, the, ghibellines, were, supporters, of, the, emperor, maximilian, i, holy, roman, emperor, cities, and, families, used, the, names, until, charles, v, holy, roman, emperor, consolidated, the, imperial, power, over, italy, in, 1529, in, the, course, of, the, italian, wars, of, 1494, to, 1559, the, political, landscape, changed, radically, and, the, division, between, guelphs, and, ghibellines, became, irrelevant, this, became, evident, with, the, election, of, pope, paul, v, 1605, the, first, to, bear, the, ghibelline, reichsadler, in, chief, on, his, papal, coat, of, arms, on, 25, march, 2015, the, parte, guelfa, was, reconstituted, as, a, christian, order, and, archconfraternity, to, serve, the, catholic, church, and, the, catholic, archdiocese, of, florence, guided, by, the, captain, general, andrea, claudio, galluzzo, under, the, custody, of, consul, luciano, artusi, the, mayor, of, florence, established, the, headquarters, of, the, reborn, guelph, party, in, the, historic, palazzo, di, parte, guelfa, in, the, city, some, individuals, and, families, indicated, their, faction, affiliation, in, their, coats, of, arms, by, including, an, appropriate, heraldic, chief, a, horizontal, band, at, the, top, of, the, shield, guelphs, had, a, capo, d, angi, or, chief, of, anjou, containing, yellow, fleurs, de, lys, on, a, blue, field, with, a, red, heraldic, label, while, ghibellines, had, a, capo, dell, impero, or, chief, of, the, empire, with, a, form, of, the, black, german, imperial, eagle, on, a, golden, background, families, also, distinguished, their, factional, allegiance, by, the, architecture, of, their, palaces, towers, and, fortresses, ghibelline, structures, had, swallow, tailed, crenellations, while, those, of, the, guelphs, were, square, during, the, 12th, and, 13th, centuries, armies, of, the, ghibelline, communes, usually, adopted, the, war, banner, of, the, holy, roman, empire, white, cross, on, a, red, field, as, their, own, guelph, armies, usually, reversed, the, colors, red, cross, on, white, these, two, schemes, are, prevalent, in, the, civic, heraldry, of, northern, italian, towns, and, remain, a, revealing, indicator, of, their, past, factional, leanings
