preparing, the, country, for, the, kpa, s, arrival, in, force, this, offensive, failed, however, the, guerrillas, were, now, entrenched, in, the, taebaek, san, region, of, the, north, gyeongsang,

1949, border, clashes, between, south, and, north, continued, on, 4, august, 1949, when, thousands, of, north, korean, troops, attacked, south, korean, troops, occupying, territory, north, of, the,

meanwhile, counterinsurgencies, in, the, south, korean, interior, intensified, persistent, operations, paired, with, worsening, weather, denied, the, guerrillas, sanctuary, and, wore, away, their, fighting, strength, north, korea, responded, by, sending, more, troops, to, link, up, with, insurgents, and, build, more, partisan, cadres, north, korean, infiltrators, had, reached, 3, 000, soldiers, in, 12, units, by, the, start, of, 1950, but, all, were, destroyed, or, scattered, by, the, roka, on, 1, october, 1949, the, roka, launched, a, three, pronged, assault, on, the, insurgents, in, south, cholla, and, taegu, by, march, 1950, the, roka, claimed, 5, 621, guerrillas, killed, or, captured, and, 1, 066, small, arms, seized, this, operation, crippled, the, insurgency, soon, after, north, korea, made, final, attempts, to, keep, the, uprising, active, sending, battalion, sized, units, of, infiltrators, under, the, commands, of, kim, sang, ho, and, kim, moo, hyon, the, first, battalion, was, reduced, to, a, single, man, over, the, course, of, engagements, by, the, roka, 8th, division, the, second, was, annihilated, by, a, two, battalion, hammer, and, anvil, maneuver, by, units, of, the, roka, 6th, division, resulting, in, a, toll, of, 584, kpa, guerrillas, 480, killed, 104, captured, and, 69, roka, troops, killed, plus, 184, wounded, by, the, spring, of, 1950, guerrilla, activity, had, mostly, subsided, the, border, too, was, calm, by, 1949, south, korean, and, us, military, actions, had, reduced, indigenous, communist, guerrillas, in, the, south, from, 5, 000, to, 1, 000, however, kim, il, sung, believed, widespread, uprisings, had, weakened, the, south, korean, military, and, that, a, north, korean, invasion, would, be, welcomed, by, much, of, the, south, korean, population, kim, began, seeking, stalin, s, support, for, an, invasion, in, march, 1949, traveling, to, moscow, to, persuade, him, stalin, initially, did, not, think, the, time, was, right, for, a, war, in, korea, pla, forces, were, still, embroiled, in, the, chinese, civil, war, while, us, forces, remained, stationed, in, south, korea, by, spring, 1950, he, believed, that, the, strategic, situation, had, changed, pla, forces, under, mao, zedong, had, secured, final, victory, us, forces, had, withdrawn, from, korea, and, the, soviets, had, detonated, their, first, nuclear, bomb, breaking, the, us, monopoly, as, the, us, had, not, directly, intervened, to, stop, the, communists, in, china, stalin, calculated, they, would, be, even, less, willing, to, fight, in, korea, which, had, less, strategic, significance, the, soviets, had, cracked, the, codes, used, by, the, us, to, communicate, with, their, embassy, in, moscow, and, reading, dispatches, convinced, stalin, that, korea, did, not, have, the, importance, to, the, us, that, would, warrant, a, nuclear, confrontation, stalin, began, a, more, aggressive, strategy, in, asia, based, on, these, developments, including, promising, economic, and, military, aid, to, china, through, the, sino, soviet, treaty, of, friendship, alliance, and, mutual, assistance, in, april, 1950, stalin, permitted, kim, to, attack, the, government, in, the, south, under, the, condition, that, mao, would, agree, to, send, reinforcements, if, needed, for, kim, this, was, the, fulfillment, of, his, goal, to, unite, korea, stalin, made, it, clear, soviet, forces, would, not, openly, engage, in, combat, to, avoid, a, direct, war, with, the, us, kim, met, with, mao, in, may, 1950, and, differing, historical, interpretations, of, the, meeting, have, been, put, forward, according, to, barbara, barnouin, and, yu, changgeng, mao, agreed, to, support, kim, despite, concerns, of, american, intervention, as, china, desperately, needed, the, economic, and, military, aid, promised, by, the, soviets, kathryn, weathersby, cites, soviet, documents, which, said, kim, secured, mao, s, support, along, with, mark, o, neill, she, says, this, accelerated, kim, s, war, preparations, chen, jian, argues, mao, never, seriously, challenged, kim, s, plans, and, kim, had, every, reason, to, inform, stalin, that, he, had, obtained, mao, s, support, 112, citing, more, recent, scholarship, zhao, suisheng, contends, mao, did, not, approve, of, kim, s, war, proposal, and, requested, verification, from, stalin, who, did, so, via, a, telegram, 28, 9, mao, accepted, the, decision, made, by, kim, and, stalin, to, unify, korea, but, cautioned, kim, over, possible, us, intervention, 30, soviet, generals, with, extensive, combat, experience, from, world, war, ii, were, sent, to, north, korea, as, the, soviet, advisory, group, they, completed, plans, for, attack, by, may, and, called, for, a, skirmish, to, be, initiated, in, the, ongjin, peninsula, on, the, west, coast, of, korea, the, north, koreans, would, then, launch, an, attack, to, capture, seoul, and, encircle, and, destroy, the, rok, the, final, stage, would, involve, destroying, south, korean, government, remnants, and, capturing, the, rest, of, south, korea, including, the, ports, on, 7, june, 1950, kim, called, for, a, korea, wide, election, on, 5, 8, august, 1950, and, a, consultative, conference, in, haeju, on, 15, 17, june, on, 11, june, the, north, sent, three, diplomats, to, the, south, as, a, peace, overture, which, rhee, rejected, outright, on, 21, june, kim, revised, his, war, plan, to, involve, a, general, attack, across, the, 38th, parallel, rather, than, a, limited, operation, in, ongjin, kim, was, concerned, that, south, korean, agents, had, learned, about, the, plans, and, that, south, korean, forces, were, strengthening, their, defenses, stalin, agreed, to, this, change, while, these, preparations, were, underway, in, the, north, there, were, clashes, along, the, 38th, parallel, especially, at, kaesong, and, ongjin, many, initiated, by, the, south, the, rok, was, being, trained, by, the, us, korean, military, advisory, group, kmag, on, the, eve, of, the, war, kmag, commander, general, william, lynn, roberts, voiced, utmost, confidence, in, the, rok, and, boasted, that, any, north, korean, invasion, would, merely, provide, target, practice, for, his, part, syngman, rhee, repeatedly, expressed, his, desire, to, conquer, the, north, including, when, us, diplomat, john, foster, dulles, visited, korea, on, 18, june, though, some, south, korean, and, us, intelligence, officers, predicted, an, attack, similar, predictions, had, been, made, before, and, nothing, had, happened, the, central, intelligence, agency, noted, the, southward, movement, by, the, kpa, but, assessed, this, as, a, defensive, measure, and, concluded, an, invasion, was, unlikely, on, 23, june, un, observers, inspected, the, border, and, did, not, detect, that, war, was, imminent, chinese, involvement, was, extensive, from, the, beginning, building, on, previous, collaboration, between, the, chinese, and, korean, communists,

mig, 15, one, of, the, world, s, most, advanced, jet, fighters, the, usaf, countered, the, mig, 15, by, sending, over, three, squadrons, of, its, most, capable, fighter, the, f, 86, sabre, these, arrived, in, december, 1950, the, soviet, union, denied, the, involvement, of, their, personnel, in, anything, other, than, an, advisory, role, but, air, combat, quickly, resulted, in, soviet, pilots, dropping, their, code, signals, and, speaking, over, the, radio, in, russian, this, known, direct, soviet, participation, was, a, casus, belli, that, the, un, command, deliberately, overlooked, lest, the, war, expand, to, include, the, soviet, union, and, potentially, escalate, into, atomic, warfare, after, the, war, and, to, the, present, day, the, usaf, reported, an, inflated, f, 86, sabre,

of, soviet, air, forces, in, korea, are, more, favorable, to, the, communist, side, the, 64th, corps, claimed, a, total, 1, 097, enemy, aircraft, of, all, types, during, operations, for, the, loss, of, 335, aircraft, including, lost, to, enemy, ground, fire, accidents, etc, and, 110, pilots, soviet, reports, put, the, overall, kill, ratio, at, 3, 4, 1, in, favor, of, soviet, pilots, as,

1, in, later, 1952, and, 1, 9, 1, in, 1953, this, was, because, more, advanced, jet, fighters, appeared, on, the, un, side, as, well, as, improved, u, s, tactics, regardless, of, the, actual, ratio, american, sabres, were, very, effective, at, controlling, the, skies, over, korea, since, no, other, un, fighter, could, contend, with, the, mig, 15, f, 86s, largely, took, over, air, combat, once, they, arrived, relegating, other, aircraft, to, air, to, ground, operations, despite, much, greater, numbers, the, number, of, sabres, in, theater, never, exceeded, 150, while, mig, 15s, reached, 900, at, their, peak, communist, aircraft, were, seldom, encountered, south, of, pyongyang, un, ground, forces, supply, lines, and, infrastructure, were, not, attacked, from, the, air, although, north, korea, had, 75, airfields, capable, of, supporting, migs, after, 1951, any, serious, effort, to, operate, from, them, was, abandoned, the, migs, were, instead, based, across, the, yalu, river, in,

in, korea, where, rough, terrain, prevented, use, of, the, jeep, as, a, speedy, medevac, vehicle, helicopters, like, the, sikorsky, h, 19, were, heavily, used, this, helped, reduce, fatal, casualties, to, a, dramatic, degree, when, combined, with, complementary, medical, innovations, such, as, mobile, army, surgical, hospitals, mash, as, such, the, medical, evacuation, and, care, system, for, the, wounded, was, so, effective, for, the, un, forces, that, a, wounded, soldier, who, arrived, at, a, mash, unit, alive, typically, had, a, 97, chance, of, survival, the, limitations, of, jet, aircraft,

forces, if, they, entered, the, war, by, july, truman, approved, another, b, 29, deployment, to, britain, this, time, with, bombs, but, without, their, cores, to, remind, the, soviets, of, u, s, offensive, ability, deployment, of, a, similar, fleet, to, guam, was, leaked, to, the, new, york, times, as, un, forces, retreated, to, pusan, and, the, cia, reported, that, mainland, china, was,

likely, continental, expansion, the, u, s, forgoing, atomic, warfare, was, not, because, of, a, disinclination, by, the, soviet, union, and, people, s, republic, of, china, to, escalate, but, because, un, allies, notably, the, uk, the, commonwealth, and, france, were, concerned, about, a, geopolitical, imbalance, rendering, nato, defenseless, while, the, u, s, fought, china, who, then, might, persuade, the, soviet, union, to, conquer, western, europe, the, joint, chiefs, of, staff, advised, truman, to, tell, attlee, that, the, u, s, would, use, nuclear, weapons, only, if, necessary, to,

identification, of, large, masses, of, enemy, troops, was, extremely, rare, ridgway, was, authorized, to, use, nuclear, weapons, if, a, major, air, attack, originated, from, outside, korea, an, envoy, was, sent, to, hong, kong, to, deliver, a, warning, to, china, the, message, likely, caused, chinese, leaders, to, be, more, cautious, about, potential, u, s, use, of, nuclear, weapons, but, whether, they, learned, about, the, b, 29, deployment, is, unclear, and, the, failure, of, the, two, major, chinese, offensives, that, month, likely, was, what, caused, them, to, shift, to, a, defensive,

ability, of, china, to, mobilize, and, move, forces, strategically, attacking, chinese, cities, to, destroy, civilian, industry, and, infrastructure, would, cause, the, immediate, dispersion, of, the, leadership, away, from, such, areas, and, give, propaganda, value, for, the, communists, to, galvanize, the, support, of, chinese, civilians, since, the, soviets, were, not, expected, to, intervene, with, their, few, primitive, atomic, weapons, on, china, or, north, korea, s, behalf, the, threat, of, a, possible, nuclear, exchange, was, unimportant, in, the, decision, not, to, deploy, atomic, bombs, their, use, offered, little, operational, advantage, and, would, undesirably, lower, the, threshold, for, using, atomic, weapons, against, non, nuclear, states, in, future, conflicts, when,

communist, regime, was, still, consolidating, its, own, power, after, winning, the, chinese, civil, war, mao, supported, intervention, not, to, save, north, korea, but, because, he, believed, that, a, military, conflict, with, the, u, s, was, inevitable, after, the, u, s, entered, the, war, and, to, appease, the, soviet, union, to, secure, military, dispensation, and, achieve, mao, s, goal, of, making, china, a, major, world, military, power, mao, was, equally, ambitious, in, improving, his, own, prestige, inside, the, communist, international, community, by, demonstrating, that, his,

by, western, powers, over, the, previous, hundred, years, highlighting, the, abilities, of, the, pla, and, the, chinese, communist, party, the, most, significant, negative, long, term, consequence, of, the, war, for, china, was, that, it, led, the, united, states, to, guarantee, the, safety, of, chiang, kaishek, s, regime, in, taiwan, effectively, ensuring, that, taiwan, would, remain, outside, of, prc, control, through, the, present, day, mao, had, also, discovered, the, usefulness, of, large, scale, mass, movements, in, the, war, while, implementing, them, among, most, of, his, ruling,
