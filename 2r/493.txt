cause, of, the, war, was, a, nitrate, taxation, dispute, between, bolivia, and, chile, with, peru, being, drawn, in, due, to, its, secret, alliance, with, bolivia, some, historians, have, pointed, to, deeper, origins, of, the, war, such, as, the, interest, of, chile, and, peru, in, the, nitrate, business, a, long, standing, rivalry, between, chile, and, peru, for, regional, hegemony, as, well, as,

bipartite, tax, collecting, caused, discontent, and, the, treaty, lasted, for, only, eight, years, in, february, 1873, peru, and, bolivia, signed, a, secret, treaty, of, alliance, against, chile, the, last, clause, kept, it, secret, as, long, as, both, parties, considered, its, publication, unnecessary, until, it, was, revealed, in, 1879, argentina, long, involved, in, a, dispute, with, chile, over, the, strait, of, magellan, and, patagonia, was, secretly, invited, to, join, the, pact, and, in, september, 1873, the, argentine, chamber, of, deputies, approved, the, treaty, and, 6, 000, 000, argentine, peso, for, war, preparations, eventually, argentina, and, bolivia, did, not, agree, on, the, territories, of, tarija, and, chaco, and, argentina, also, feared, an, alliance, of, chile, with, brazil, the, argentine, senate, postponed, and, then, rejected, the, approval, but, in, 1875, and, 1877, after, border, disputes, with, chile, flared, up, anew, argentina, sought, to, join, the, treaty, at, the, onset, of, the, war, in, a, renewed, attempt, peru, offered, argentina, the, chilean, territories, from, 24, to, 27, s, if, argentina, adhered, to, the, pact, and, fought, in, the, war, historians, including, g, bulnes, basadre, and, yrigoyen, agree, that, the, real, intention, of, the, treaty, was, to, compel, chile, to, modify, its, borders, according, to, the, geopolitical, interests, of, argentina, peru, and, bolivia, as, chile, was, militarily, weak, before, the, arrival, of, the, chilean, ironclads, almirante, cochrane, and, blanco, encalada, chile, was, not, informed, about, the, pact, until, it, learned, of, it, at, first, cursorily, by, a, leak, in, the, argentine, congress, in, september, 1873, when, the, argentine, senate, discussed, the, invitation, to, join, the, peru, bolivia, alliance, the, peruvian, mediator, antonio, de, lavalle, stated, in, his, memoirs, that, he, did, not, learn, of, it, until, march, 1879, and, hilarion, daza, was, not, informed, of, the, pact, until, december, 1878, the, peruvian, historian, basadre, states, that, one, of, peru, s, reasons, for, signing, the, treaty, was, to, impede, a, chilean, bolivian, alliance, against, peru, that, would, have, given, to, bolivia, the, region, of, arica, almost, all, bolivian, commerce, went, through, peruvian, ports, of, arica, before, the, war, and, transferred, antofagasta, to, chile, the, chilean, offers, to, bolivia, to, change, allegiance, were, made, several, times, even, during, the, war, and, also, from, the, bolivian, side, at, least, six, times, on, 26, december, 1874, the, recently, built, ironclad, cochrane, arrived, in, valpara, so, and, remained, in, chile, until, the, completion, of, the, blanco, encalada, that, threw, the, balance, of, power, in, the, south, pacific, toward, chile, historians, disagree, on, how, to, interpret, the, treaty, some, peruvian, and, bolivian, historians, assess, it, as, rightful, defensive, circumstantial, and, known, by, chile, from, the, very, onset, conversely, some, chilean, historians, assess, the, treaty, as, aggressive, against, chile, causing, the, war, designed, to, take, control, by, peru, of, the, bolivian, nitrate, and, hidden, from, chile, the, reasons, for, its, secrecy, its, invitation, to, argentina, to, join, the, pact, and, peru, s, refusal, to, remain, neutral, are, still, discussed, in, 1874, chile, and, bolivia, replaced, the, 1866, boundary, treaty, by, keeping, the, boundary, at, 24, s, but, granting, bolivia, the, authority, to, collect, all, tax, revenue, between, 23, and, 24, s, to, compensate, for, the, relinquishment, of, its, rights, chile, received, a, 25, year, guarantee, against, tax, increases, on, chilean, commercial, interests, and, their, exports, article, 4, explicitly, forbade, tax, increases, on, chilean, enterprises, for, 25, years, the, duties, of, exportation, that, may, be, levied, on, minerals, exploited, in, the, zone, referred, to, in, the, preceding, articles, shall, not, exceed, those, now, in, force, and, chilean, citizens, industry, and, capital, shall, not, be, subjected, to, any, other, contributions, what, ever, except, those, now, existing, the, stipulations, in, this, article, shall, last, for, twenty, five, years, all, disputes, arising, under, the, treaty, would, be, settled, by, arbitration, the, historian, william, f, sater, gives, several, possible, and, compatible, reasons, for, the, war, he, considers, the, causes, to, be, domestic, economic, and, geopolitical, several, authors, agree, with, them, but, others, only, partially, support, his, arguments, some, historians, argue, that, chile, was, devastated, by, the, economic, crisis, of, the, 1870s, and, was, looking, for, a, replacement, for, its, silver, copper, and, wheat, exports, it, has, been, argued, that, the, economic, situation, and, the, view, of, new, wealth, in, nitrate, were, the, true, reasons, for, the, chilean, elite, to, go, to, war, against, peru, and, bolivia, the, holder, of, the, chilean, nitrate, companies, according, to, sater, bulldozed, chilean, president, an, bal, pinto, into, declaring, war, to, protect, the, owner, of, the, compa, a, de, salitres, y, ferrocarril, de, antofagasta, csfa, and, then, to, seize, bolivia, s, and, peru, s, salitreras, saltpeter, works, several, members, of, the, chilean, government, were, shareholders, of, csfa, and, they, are, believed, to, have, hired, the, services, of, one, of, the, country, s, newspapers, to, push, their, case, another, us, american, historian, david, healy, rejects, that, thesis, and, fredrick, b, pike, calls, the, allegation, absurd, the, economic, development, that, accompanied, and, followed, the, war, was, so, remarkable, that, marxist, writers, feel, justified, in, alleging, that, chile, s, great, military, adventure, was, instigated, by, self, seeking, capitalists, to, bring, their, country, out, of, the, business, stagnation, that, had, begun, in, 1878, since, the, war, provided, chile, with, the, economic, means, to, come, of, age, sater, states, that, that, interpretation, overlooks, certain, important, facts, the, chilean, investors, in, bolivia, correctly, feared, that, daza, the, bolivian, dictator, would, use, the, war, as, an, excuse, to, expropriate, their, investments, among, them, were, melchor, de, concha, y, toro, the, politically, powerful, president, of, chile, s, camara, de, diputados, jer, nimo, urmeneta, 105, and, lorenzo, claro, a, chilean, founder, of, the, banco, de, bolivia, and, a, prominent, member, of, the, national, party, a, santiago, newspaper, claimed, that, melchor, de, concha, y, toro, offered, president, pinto, 2, 000, 000, chilean, pesos, to, end, the, dispute, and, to, return, to, the, 1874, border, in, other, words, writes, w, sater, there, were, as, many, powerful, interests, opposed, to, helping, the, compa, a, de, salitres, as, there, were, those, seeking, to, aid, the, corporation, also, b, farcau, objects, to, the, argument, on, the, other, hand, the, sorry, state, of, the, chilean, armed, forces, at, the, outbreak, of, the, war, as, will, be, discussed, in, the, following, chapter, hardly, supports, a, theory, of, conscious, premeditated, aggression, sater, cites, other, sources, that, state, that, the, true, causes, of, the, conflict, were, not, economic, but, geopolitical, a, struggle, for, control, of, the, southeastern, portion, of, the, pacific, ocean, in, 1836, the, peruvian, government, tried, to, monopolize, commerce, in, the, south, pacific, by, rewarding, ships, that, sailed, directly, to, callao, to, the, detriment, of, valpara, so, peru, tried, to, impede, the, agreement, that, had, been, reached, between, spain, and, chile, to, free, its, new, warships, built, and, embargoed, in, britain, during, the, chincha, islands, war, sater, cites, germany, s, minister, in, chile, who, argued, that, the, war, with, peru, and, bolivia, would, have, erupted, sooner, or, later, on, any, pretext, he, considered, that, bolivia, and, peru, had, developed, a, bitter, envy, against, chile, and, its, material, progress, and, good, government, frederik, b, pike, states, the, fundamental, cause, for, the, eruption, of, hostilities, was, the, mounting, power, and, prestige, and, the, economic, and, political, stability, of, chile, on, one, hand, and, the, weakness, and, the, political, and, economic, deterioration, of, bolivia, on, the, other, the, war, and, its, outcome, was, as, inevitable, as, the, 1846, 1848, conflict, between, the, united, states, and, mexico, in, both, instances, a, relatively, well, governed, energetic, and, economically, expanding, nation, had, been, irresistibly, tempted, by, neighboring, territories, that, were, underdeveloped, malgoverned, and, sparsely, occupied, 128, another, reason, according, to, sater, was, peru, s, desire, to, monopolize, and, appropriate, the, nitrate, works, to, strengthen, its, nitrate, monopoly, which, required, the, bolivian, and, chilean, salitreras, to, be, controlled, by, peru, as, unenviable, as, chile, s, situation, was, in, the, 1870s, that, of, peru, was, much, worse, the, 1870s, was, for, peru, s, economy, a, decade, of, crisis, and, change, nitrate, extraction, rose, while, guano, exports, the, source, of, substantial, revenue, for, peru, declined, from, 575, 000, tons, in, 1869, to, less, than, 350, 000, tons, in, 1873, and, the, chincha, islands, and, other, guano, islands, were, depleted, or, nearly, so, william, edmundson, writes, in, a, history, of, the, british, presence, in, chile, peru, has, its, own, reasons, to, enter, the, dispute, rory, miller, 1993, argues, that, the, depletion, of, guano, resources, and, poor, management, of, the, economy, in, peru, had, provoked, a, crisis, this, has, caused, peru, to, default, on, its, external, debt, in, 1876, in, that, year, the, peruvian, government, decided, to, procure, a, loan, of, seven, millions, pounds, of, which, four, millions, pounds, were, earmarked, to, purchase, privately, owned, oficinas, and, peru, defaulted, again, in, 1877, to, increase, guano, revenue, peru, created, a, monopoly, on, nitrate, commerce, in, 1875, its, aims, were, to, increase, prices, curb, exports, and, to, impede, competition, but, most, larger, nitrate, firms, opposed, the, monopoly, on, sales, of, nitrate, when, they, were, unsuccessful, peru, in, 1876, began, to, expropriate, nitrate, producers, and, to, buy, nitrate, concessions, such, as, that, of, henry, meiggs, in, bolivia, toco, south, of, the, loa, river, however, the, csfa, was, too, expensive, to, be, purchased, as, peruvian, historian, alejandro, reyes, states, the, bolivian, salitreras, needed, to, be, controlled, which, resulted, in, the, internationalization, of, the, conflict, since, they, were, owned, by, chilean, and, european, merchants, as, the, chilean, company, was, to, be, auctioned, on, 14, february, 1879, in, antofagasta, it, was, considered, that, the, peruvian, consul, would, be, the, highest, bidder, however, some, sources, according, to, sater, see, the, declarations, of, war, between, chile, and, peru, as, a, product, of, popular, domestic, forces, the, peruvian, president, had, to, declare, war, to, keep, his, position, sater, cites, the, british, minister, in, lima, spencer, st, john, the, rival, parties, may, try, to, make, political, capital, out, of, jealousy, for, the, national, honor, and, his, excellency, may, be, forced, to, give, way, to, the, popular, sentiment, chilean, president, pinto, was, under, similar, pressures, bruce, farcau, considers, that, to, be, the, main, cause, for, the, war, outbreak, the, argument, that, the, attitude, of, the, peoples, of, the, region, was, just, ripe, for, war, seems, best, to, fit, the, bill, beginning, in, 1866, the, chilean, entrepreneurs, jos, santos, ossa, and, francisco, puelma, exploited, deposits, of, sodium, nitrate, in, bolivian, territory, the, salitreras, named, las, salinas, and, carmen, alto, 122, kilometres, 76, mi, and, 128, kilometres, 80, mi, from, antofagasta, respectively, and, secured, concessions, from, bolivian, president, mariano, melgarejo, in, 1868, a, company, named, compa, a, melbourne, clark, was, established, in, valpara, so, chile, with, 34, british, capital, provided, by, antony, gibbs, sons, of, london, which, also, held, shares, of, salitreras, in, peru, its, shareholders, included, a, number, of, leading, chilean, politicians, the, company, obtained, a, license, from, the, melgarejo, administration, to, construct, a, railroad, from, antofagasta, to, salinas, and, was, renamed, compa, a, de, salitres, y, ferrocarril, de, antofagasta, csfa, in, 1871, a, new, bolivian, government, canceled, all, contracts, signed, by, melgarejo, but, on, 22, november, 1872, a, bolivian, decree, allowed, the, government, to, renegotiate, the, contracts, on, 27, november, 1873, csfa, obtained, a, license, from, the, new, administration, in, bolivia, to, exploit, saltpeter, without, duty, for, 15, years, but, a, dispute, arose, regarding, whether, the, original, 1872, decree, under, which, the, 1873, license, was, issued, required, the, authorization, of, the, bolivian, congress, some, lawyers, placed, emphasis, on, con, cargo, a, dar, cuenta, a, la, pr, xima, legislatura, spanish, for, to, be, considered, during, the, next, legislative, session, but, others, on, s, lo, en, los, casos, de, no, avenimiento, spanish, for, only, in, cases, that, no, settlement, in, 1873, the, peruvian, government, dictated, the, ley, del, estanco, del, salitre, which, limited, the, saltpeter, production, and, authorized, the, government, to, purchase, the, whole, production, to, a, fixed, price, however, the, plan, failed, and, the, law, was, repealed, in, 1875, the, peruvian, government, expropriated, the, salitreras, of, tarapac, to, create, a, monopoly, in, guano, and, nitrate, and, in, 1876, antony, gibbs, sons, became, the, consignee, of, the, nitrate, trade, for, the, peruvian, government, president, mariano, ignacio, prado, was, determined, to, complete, the, monopoly, and, in, 1876, peru, bought, the, nitrate, licenses, for, el, toco, auctioned, by, a, bolivian, decree, of, 13, january, 1876, however, the, chilean, company, remained, the, most, serious, competitor, and, clearly, weakened, peru, s, monopoly, president, pardo, prado, s, predecessor, had, urged, gibbs, to, secure, the, monopoly, by, limiting, the, csfa, s, output, and, henry, gibbs, had, warned, the, csfa, s, board, of, directors, in, a, letter, on, 16, april, 1878, that, its, refusal, to, limit, its, output, would, bring, administrative, trouble, with, peru, and, bolivia, as, it, is, made, more, and, more, to, the, interest, of, a, neighboring, government, that, they, should, be, so, gibbs, made, repeated, unsuccessful, efforts, in, 1876, and, 1877, to, persuade, edwards, the, chilean, majority, shareholder, to, accept, a, limit, to, its, production, the, historian, ronald, bruce, st, john, in, foreign, policy, of, peru, states, although, persuasive, evidence, linking, peru, to, either, the, ten, centavo, tax, or, bolivia, s, decision, to, confiscate, chilean, holdings, in, antofagasta, never, surfaced, it, must, be, recognized, that, peruvian, interests, had, deep, seated, economical, and, political, reasons, for, going, to, war, in, 1875, the, city, of, antofagasta, had, attempted, to, impose, a, 3, cents, tax, on, the, csfa, but, the, bolivian, state, council, consejo, de, estado, headed, by, serapio, reyes, ortiz, who, would, be, minister, of, foreign, affairs, during, the, crisis, rejected, the, tax, because, it, violated, the, license, of, 1873, and, the, boundary, treaty, of, 1874, on, 14, february, 1878, the, national, congress, of, bolivia, and, the, national, constituent, assembly, approved, the, 1873, license, if, the, company, paid, a, 10, cents, per, quintal, tax, but, the, company, objected, by, citing, the, 1874, treaty, that, the, increased, payments, were, illegal, and, demanded, an, intervention, from, the, chilean, government, the, csfa, s, directory, board, perceived, the, tax, as, a, peruvian, move, to, displace, chileans, from, the, nitrate, production, as, had, occurred, in, tarapac, in, 1875, when, the, peruvian, government, expropriated, the, salitreras, having, surrendered, its, claim, to, the, disputed, territories, in, return, for, a, bolivian, promise, to, avoid, increasing, the, tax, chile, claimed, that, the, treaty, did, not, allow, for, such, a, tax, hike, bolivia, suspended, the, tax, in, april, 1878, in,

government, on, the, secret, treaty, between, peru, and, bolivia, which, had, been, revealed, to, him, by, peruvian, president, prado, 154ff, on, 23, march, on, their, way, to, occupy, calama, 554, chilean, troops, and, cavalry, defeated, 135, bolivian, soldiers, and, civilians, who, were, dug, in, at, two, destroyed, bridges, next, to, the, top, ter, ford, the, battle, of, top, ter, was, the, first, battle, of, the, war, when, the, chilean, government, asked, lavalle, directly, and, officially, whether, a, defensive, alliance, existed, that, committed, peru, to, assist, bolivia, in, a, war, with, chile, and, whether, lima, planned, to, honor, the, agreement, lavalle, could, prevaricate, no, longer, and, answered, yes, to, both, chilean, president, pinto, sought, and, received, legislative, approval, to, declare, war, which, he, did, on, 5, april, 1879, peru, responded, on, 6, april, when, prado, declared, the, casus, foederis, historians, agree, that, the, belligerents, were, not, prepared, for, the, war, financially, or, militarily, none, of, the, three, nations, had, a, general, staff, medical, corps, or, military, logistics, and, their, warships, were, in, a, deplorable, state, in, chile, for, example, the, military, contingent, had, been, reduced, continuously, from, 3, 776, by, 1867, to, 2, 400, by, 1879, men, 140, and, no, military, unit, was, deployed, north, of, valpara, so, 1700, km, south, of, iquique, 143, by, the, end, of, the, war, 53, of, chief, engineers, serving, in, chilean, warships, were, foreigners, the, government, of, peru, was, again, in, default, of, payment, and, in, bolivia, famine, spread, over, the, country, according, to, william, sater, chile, and, peru, enlisted, temporarily, 2, of, the, male, population, but, bolivia, only, 1, after, the, battle, of, tacna, both, of, the, allied, armies, were, disbanded, and, had, to, be, formed, again, the, allied, forces, at, first, glance, had, some, advantages, over, the, chilean, forces, their, population, and, armies, doubled, the, chileans, in, numbers, and, the, peruvian, port, of, callao, s, powerful, artillery, was, impregnable, for, the, chilean, navy, and, a, secure, haven, for, the, peruvian, navy, in, callao, an, english, company, offered, the, service, of, a, floating, dock, for, ships, up, to, 3000, tonnes, and, the, peruvian, government, used, it, to, repair, their, ships, at, the, outset, of, the, war, 119, those, are, some, reasons, that, led, the, international, press, to, expect, a, chilean, defeat, as, the, war, started, moreover, the, ambivalent, argentine, position, and, the, ongoing, mapuche, conflict, overshadowed, the, chilean, perspective, 109, jorge, basadre, commented, on, the, public, opinion, in, peru, and, bolivia, they, ignored, the, real, power, of, chile, and, the, horrors, of, war, and, simple, minded, people, believed, that, the, allied, would, win, the, war, because, they, together, were, bigger, than, chile, however, other, observers, made, a, more, in, depth, analysis, which, showed, chilean, political, and, military, advantages, chile, had, a, stable, political, system, since, 1833, that, had, developed, and, strengthened, its, institutions, the, chilean, army, and, the, navy, had, educated, officers, soldiers, with, professional, experience, in, the, mapuche, conflict, 43, and, uniformly, modern, arms, almost, all, chilean, soldiers, were, armed, with, comblain, or, gras, rifles, the, chilean, navy, also, possessed, two, new, ironclads, which, were, invincible, against, the, older, peruvian, warships, although, there, was, interference, between, military, and, government, over, policy, during, the, war, the, primacy, of, the, government, was, never, questioned, the, chilean, supply, line, from, europe, through, the, magellan, strait, was, only, once, threatened, unsuccessfully, by, the, peruvian, navy, the, allied, armies, were, heavily, involved, in, domestic, politics, and, neglected, their, military, duties, and, poor, planning, and, administration, caused, them, to, buy, different, rifles, with, different, calibers, that, hampered, the, instruction, of, conscripts, the, maintenance, of, arms, and, the, supply, of, ammunition, the, peruvian, navy, warships, manned, before, the, war, by, chilean, sailors, had, to, be, replaced, by, foreign, crews, when, the, war, began, bolivia, had, no, navy, the, allied, armies, had, nothing, comparable, to, the, chilean, cavalry, and, artillery, its, few, roads, and, railroad, lines, made, the, nearly, waterless, and, largely, unpopulated, atacama, desert, difficult, to, occupy, from, the, beginning, naval, superiority, was, critical, bolivia, had, no, navy, and, so, on, 26, march, 1879, hilari, n, daza, formally, offered, letters, of, marque, to, any, ships, willing, to, fight, for, bolivia, the, armada, de, chile, and, the, marina, de, guerra, del, per, fought, the, naval, battles, early, on, chile, blockaded, the, peruvian, port, of, iquique, on, 5, april, in, the, battle, of, iquique, on, 21, may, 1879, the, peruvian, ironclad, hu, scar, engaged, and, sank, the, wooden, esmeralda, meanwhile, during, the, battle, of, punta, gruesa, the, peruvian, ironclad, independencia, struck, a, submerged, rock, and, sank, in, the, shallow, waters, near, punta, gruesa, while, chasing, the, schooner, covadonga, peru, broke, the, blockade, of, iquique, and, chile, lost, the, old, esmeralda, but, the, loss, of, the, independencia, cost, peru, 40, of, its, naval, offensive, power, it, also, made, a, strong, impression, upon, military, leaders, in, argentina, and, the, possibility, of, argentina, s, intervention, in, the, war, became, far, more, remote, despite, being, outnumbered, the, peruvian, monitor, hu, scar, held, off, the, chilean, navy, for, six, months, and, upheld, peru, s, morale, during, the, early, stages, of, the, conflict, 108, the, capture, of, the, steamship, r, mac, on, 23, july, 1879, carrying, a, cavalry, regiment, the, carabineros, de, yungay, was, the, chilean, army, s, largest, loss, until, then, that, led, to, the, resignation, of, contraalmirante, rear, admiral, juan, williams, rebolledo, the, chief, of, the, chilean, navy, on, 17, august, commodore, galvarino, riveros, c, rdenas, replaced, him, and, devised, a, plan, to, catch, the, hu, scar, meanwhile, the, peruvian, navy, pursued, other, actions, particularly, in, august, 1879, when, the, uni, n, unsuccessfully, raided, punta, arenas, near, the, strait, of, magellan, in, an, attempt, to, capture, the, british, merchant, ship, gleneg, which, was, transporting, weapons, and, supplies, to, chile, the, battle, of, angamos, proved, decisive, on, 8, october, 1879, and, peru, was, reduced, almost, exclusively, to, land, forces, in, the, battle, the, chilean, navy, captured, the, hu, scar, after, several, hours, of, fierce, fighting, even, though, her, surviving, crewmen, sought, to, scuttle, her, the, chilean, navy, was, thereafter, free, to, carry, troops, for, the, invasion, of, peru, and, to, provide, fire, support, for, amphibious, assault, and, other, troops, operating, in, the, conflict, areas, chilean, warships, also, had, to, impose, a, naval, blockade, of, peruvian, ports, and, end, the, smuggling, of, arms, from, panama, into, peru, via, the, pacific, after, the, battle, despite, the, loss, of, both, of, peru, s, main, ships, the, peruvians, used, simple, and, ingenious, ruses, to, sink, two, important, chilean, ships, the, loa, july, 1880, and, the, covadonga, august, 1880, but, its, remaining, vessels, were, locked, in, callao, during, its, long, blockade, by, the, chileans, on, the, other, hand, the, chilean, navy, captured, the, ship, pilcomayo, in, november, 1879, and, the, torpedo, boat, alay, in, december, 1880, when, lima, fell, after, the, battles, of, chorrillos, and, miraflores, the, peruvian, naval, officers, scuttled, their, remaining, fleet, to, prevent, its, capture, by, the, chilean, forces, during, the, sierra, campaign, chilean, ships, were, dedicated, to, guarding, the, peruvian, coast, and, transporting, military, detachments, and, war, material, for, land, operations, in, november, 1883, during, the, final, phase, of, the, war, the, chilean, military, command, sent, the, chilean, torpedo, boat, colo, colo, to, lake, titicaca, via, railroad, from, mollendo, to, puno, to, control, that, lake, the, presence, of, the, torpedo, boat, prevented, communications, through, this, route, and, its, use, for, military, purposes, and, the, peruvian, vessels, that, had, taken, refuge, in, the, vicinity, surrendered, to, the, chileans, the, deployment, of, the, torpedo, boat, also, induced, the, bolivian, government, to, agree, to, a, peace, treaty, with, chile, in, 1884, after, the, battle, of, angamos, once, chile, achieved, naval, supremacy, the, government, had, to, decide, where, to, strike, the, options, were, tarapac, moquegua, or, directly, lima, because, of, its, proximity, to, chile, and, the, capture, of, the, peruvian, salitreras, chile, decided, to, occupy, the, peruvian, province, of, tarapac, first, arica, and, iquique, were, isolated, and, separated, by, the, atacama, desert, since, the, capture, of, the, hu, scar, in, october, 1879, neither, port, had, naval, protection, needed, to, be, adequately, supplied, by, sea, without, any, communication, or, withdrawal, lines, the, area, was, essentially, cut, off, from, the, rest, of, peru, after, the, loss, of, its, naval, capabilities, peru, had, the, option, to, withdraw, to, central, peru, to, strengthen, its, army, around, lima, until, the, re, establishment, of, a, naval, balance, or, to, build, up, new, alliances, as, hinted, by, the, chilean, historian, wilhelm, ekdahl, however, jorge, basadre, assumes, that, it, would, have, been, striking, and, humiliating, to, abandon, tarapac, the, source, of, peru, s, wealth, on, 30, april, 1879, after, 13, days, of, marching, 4, 500, bolivian, soldiers, commanded, by, daza, arrived, in, tacna, a, town, 100, km, 60, mi, north, of, arica, the, bolivians, had, come, to, join, the, peruvian, forces, commanded, by, juan, buendia, the, allied, forces, were, deployed, to, the, places, that, a, chilean, landing, could, be, expected, the, iquique, pisagua, or, arica, tacna, regions, there, were, reserves, stationed, at, arequipa, farther, north, in, peru, under, lizardo, montero, as, well, as, in, southern, bolivia, under, narciso, campero, the, reserves, were, to, be, deployed, to, the, coast, after, a, landing, but, failed, to, arrive, the, land, war, can, be, seen, as, four, chilean, military, campaigns, that, successively, occupied, tarapac, arica, tacna, and, lima, and, a, final, campaign, that, ended, the, peruvian, resistance, in, the, sierra, the, occupation, of, arequipa, and, puno, at, the, end, of, the, war, saw, little, military, action, the, campaign, of, tarapac, began, on, november, 2, 1879, when, nine, steam, transporters, escorted, by, half, of, the, chilean, navy, transported, 9, 500, men, and, more, than, 850, animals, to, pisagua, some, 500, kilometres, 310, mi, north, of, antofagasta, after, neutralizing, the, coastal, batteries, the, chileans, landed, and, attacked, beach, defenses, in, pisagua, in, the, event, of, a, chilean, landing, the, allied, forces, planned, to, counterattack, the, chilean, forces, in, a, pincer, movement, involving, advances, from, the, north, daza, s, forces, coming, from, arica, and, from, the, south, buendia, s, forces, coming, from, iquique, although, peruvian, forces, marched, northwards, as, planned, after, the, fall, of, pisagua, daza, coming, from, arica, decided, in, camarones, 44, km, from, pisagua, to, give, up, his, part, of, the, counterattack, and, return, to, arica, the, chileans, meanwhile, marched, towards, iquique, and, on, 19, november, 1879, defeated, the, allied, troops, without, daza, s, men, gathered, in, agua, santa, in, the, battle, of, san, francisco, and, dolores, disbanded, bolivian, forces, there, and, the, southern, force, retreated, to, oruro, and, the, peruvians, fell, back, to, tiliviche, the, chilean, army, captured, iquique, 80, km, 50, mi, south, of, pisagua, without, resistance, some, of, the, peruvian, forces, that, had, been, defeated, at, san, francisco, retreated, on, tarapac, a, little, town, with, same, name, as, the, province, where, they, combined, with, peruvian, troops, who, withdrew, to, tarapac, directly, from, iquique, a, detachment, of, chilean, soldiers, with, cavalry, and, artillery, was, sent, to, face, the, peruvian, forces, in, tarapac, both, sides, clashed, on, 27, november, in, the, battle, of, tarapac, and, the, chilean, forces, were, defeated, but, the, peruvian, forces, without, lines, of, communication, with, their, supply, bases, in, peru, or, bolivia, could, not, maintain, their, occupation, of, the, territory, consequently, the, peruvians, retreated, north, through, harsh, desert, terrain, to, arica, and, lost, many, troops, during, their, withdrawal, bruce, w, farcau, comments, that, the, province, of, tarapac, was, lost, along, with, a, population, of, 200, 000, nearly, one, tenth, of, the, peruvian, total, and, an, annual, gross, income, of, 28, million, in, nitrate, production, virtually, all, of, the, country, s, export, earnings, the, victory, afforded, santiago, an, economic, boon, and, a, potential, diplomatic, asset, the, rimac, s, capture, the, sinking, of, the, esmeralda, and, the, passiveness, of, the, chilean, fleet, showed, that, the, command, of, the, navy, was, unprepared, for, the, war, and, the, army, also, had, trouble, with, the, logistics, medical, service, and, command, public, discontent, with, poor, decisions, led, to, riots, and, the, government, had, to, replace, the, sclerotics, chief, of, the, navy, juan, williams, rebolledo, by, galvarino, riveros, and, the, chief, of, the, army, justo, arteaga, by, erasmo, escala, after, tarapac, the, army, was, reorganized, into, divisions, chile, s, foreign, policy, tried, to, separate, bolivia, from, peru, gonzalo, bulnes, writes, the, target, of, the, pol, tica, boliviana, was, the, same, as, before, to, seize, tacna, and, arica, for, bolivia, and, put, bolivia, as, a, buffer, state, between, peru, and, chile, on, the, assumption, that, peru, would, accept, the, chilean, peace, conditions, the, initiated, called, such, policy, to, clear, up, bolivia, moreover, the, chilean, government, had, to, find, a, border, agreement, with, argentina, to, avoid, war, after, the, occupation, of, the, salpeter, and, guano, deposits, the, chilean, government, restituted, the, oficinas, salitreras, which, had, been, nationalized, by, peru, to, the, owner, of, the, certificate, of, debt, the, alternative, of, a, chilean, state, company, of, salpeter, was, discarded, as, too, onerous, for, a, government, waging, war, and, lacking, experienced, personnel, and, the, creditors, pressed, the, issue, in, 1879, chile, began, to, exact, a, tax, of, 40, cents, per, quintal, m, trico, 100, kg, increasing, to, 1, 60, in, 1880, as, provided, by, the, secret, treaty, the, allies, agreed, in, the, protocol, of, subsidies, for, bolivia, to, bear, the, costs, of, the, war, the, agreement, which, regulated, the, tax, income, for, many, years, caused, resentments, and, fears, in, bolivia, whose, deployment, of, forces, to, tacna, was, seen, as, helping, peru, also, bolivia, knew, that, its, army, would, be, sent, not, to, free, the, occupied, region, of, bolivia, but, to, protect, peru, as, daza, and, his, officers, came, to, tacna, and, arica, they, failed, to, see, the, expected, peruvian, military, strength, and, understood, that, their, position, of, power, in, bolivia, was, threatened, by, a, defeat, of, the, allies, the, bolivian, historian, querejazu, suggests, that, daza, successfully, used, the, chilean, offer, of, tacna, and, arica, for, bolivia, to, exert, pressure, on, peru, to, get, a, more, favorable, protocol, of, subsidies, the, reason, that, daza, abandoned, the, peruvian, forces, in, iquique, and, turned, back, to, arica, just, before, the, battle, of, san, francisco, is, uncertain, some, historians, say, that, he, wanted, to, keep, the, regimiento, colorados, untouched, since, the, force, secured, his, political, power, in, bolivia, daza, later, stated, that, his, officers, refused, to, continue, the, march, through, the, desert, but, his, shameful, withdrawal, accelerated, his, downfall, and, he, was, succeeded, by, narciso, campero, in, the, new, government, there, was, a, strong, tendency, to, accept, the, chilean, offer, of, tacna, and, arica, but, it, was, eventually, refused, bolivia, signed, the, creation, of, the, united, states, of, peru, and, bolivia, a, political, fantasy, without, any, practical, consequences, bolivia, helped, peru, with, money, and, weapons, but, the, bolivian, army, never, again, intervened, in, the, war, in, peru, the, political, situation, was, complicated, president, prado, had, declared, war, on, chile, for, longstanding, economical, and, political, reasons, but, without, the, funds, or, international, credit, to, finance, the, war, he, turned, over, the, administration, of, the, state, to, vice, president, luis, la, puerta, de, mendoza, to, assume, for, himself, the, command, of, the, army, because, of, the, chilean, blockade, peru, could, not, export, revenuemaking, goods, via, its, ports, as, a, consequence, public, revenue, was, half, of, what, had, been, expected, and, spending, tripled, the, peruvian, government, in, 1879, experienced, several, political, crises, and, seven, ministers, of, finance, general, buend, a, who, led, the, defeated, allied, troops, in, iquique, and, more, chief, of, the, sunken, warship, independence, were, both, put, on, trial, but, were, eventually, acquitted, the, peruvian, government, was, confronted, with, widespread, rioting, in, lima, because, of, its, failures, on, 18, december, 1879, as, the, fall, of, iquique, became, known, in, peru, prado, went, from, callao, to, panama, allegedly, with, the, duty, to, oversee, the, purchase, of, new, arms, and, warships, for, the, nation, in, a, statement, for, the, peruvian, newspaper, el, comercio, he, turned, over, the, command, of, the, country, to, vice, president, luis, la, puerta, de, mendoza, history, has, condemned, his, departure, as, a, desertion, 27, nicol, s, de, pi, rola, overthrew, puerta, s, government, and, took, power, on, 23, december, 1879, pi, rola, has, been, criticised, because, of, his, sectarianism, frivolous, investment, bombastic, decrees, and, lack, of, control, in, the, budget, but, it, must, be, said, that, he, put, forth, an, enormous, effort, to, obtain, new, funds, and, to, mobilize, the, country, for, the, war, basadre, considered, his, work, an, act, of, heroism, abnegation, in, a, country, invaded, politically, divided, militarily, battered, and, economically, bloodless, meanwhile, chile, continued, its, advances, in, the, tacna, and, arica, campaign, on, 28, november, ten, days, after, the, battle, of, san, francisco, chile, declared, the, formal, blockade, of, arica, on, 31, december, a, chilean, force, of, 600, men, carried, out, an, amphibious, raid, at, ilo, as, a, reconnaissance, in, force, to, the, north, of, tacna, and, withdrew, the, same, day, on, 24, february, 1880, approximately, 11, 000, men, in, 19, ships, protected, by, blanco, encalada, toro, and, magallanes, and, two, torpedo, boats, sailed, from, pisagua, two, days, later, on, 26, february, the, chileans, arrived, off, punta, coles, near, pacocha, ilo, the, landing, took, several, days, to, conclude, but, faced, no, resistance, the, peruvian, commander, lizardo, montero, refused, to, try, to, drive, the, chileans, from, the, beachhead, as, the, chileans, had, expected, on, 22, march, 3, 642, chilean, troops, defeated, 1, 300, peruvian, troops, in, the, battle, of, los, ngeles, cutting, any, direct, peruvian, supply, from, lima, to, arica, or, tacna, supply, was, possible, only, through, the, long, way, via, bolivia, after, the, battle, of, los, ngeles, only, three, allied,

to, plan, the, occupation, of, lima, once, the, size, of, the, chilean, army, had, been, increased, by, 20, 000, men, to, reach, a, strength, of, 41, 000, soldiers, deployed, from, the, forts, of, the, chile, mapuche, frontier, to, the, outskirts, of, lima, the, chilean, army, began, the, campaign, of, lima, lacking, the, ships, to, transport, all, the, troops, at, once, from, arica, the, chileans, decided, to, land, a, division, and, then, the, rest, of, the, army, in, stages, their, shortage, of, shipping, also, precluded, an, immediate, landing, at, lima, instead, pisco, approximately, 320, kilometres, 200, mi, south, of, lima, was, the, first, landing, point, on, 19, november, 8, 800, men, twenty, cannons, and, their, supplies, reached, pisco, a, party, of, 400, men, was, landed, near, the, port, and, they, learned, that, a, garrison, of, 3, 000, men, defended, pisco, bypassing, it, required, a, landing, to, be, made, directly, into, the, port, and, so, a, chilean, vanguard, was, landed, in, paracas, ten, miles, to, the, south, the, force, managed, to, capture, pisco, and, on, 20, november, the, rest, of, the, chilean, troops, landed, later, occupying, various, other, nearby, coastal, cities, securing, for, the, chileans, de, facto, control, of, the, peruvian, province, of, ica, on, 2, december, 3, 500, additional, men, and, 416, horses,

decided, that, only, one, brigade, in, the, pisco, region, lynch, s, brigade, would, march, the, 55, miles, 89, km, north, to, the, coastal, town, of, chilca, a, town, only, 45, kilometres, 28, mi, from, lima, all, other, chilean, forces, would, be, re, embarked, in, pisco, for, naval, transport, to, chilca, the, chilean, troops, disembarked, in, curayaco, slightly, north, of, chilca, on, 22, december, 1880, the, artillery, was, later, disembarked, at, lur, n, on, the, southern, outskirts, of, lima, as, the, chilean, army, was, able, to, advance, quickly, after, landing, pi, rola, who, had, expected, a, landing, north, of, lima, ordered, the, construction, of, two, parallel, lines, of, peruvian, defences, one, at, chorrillos, and, one, at, miraflores, it, was, hoped, that, the, peruvian, professional, army, would, defeat, the, chileans, in, chorrillos, if, that, measure, failed, a, reserve, army, increased, with, remnants, of, chorrillos, and, the, callao, troops, were, expected, to, hold, the, chilean, advance, at, miraflores, the, peruvian, forces, numbered, approximately, 25, 000, to, 32, 000, men, and, were, titled, the, army, of, lima, the, main, peruvian, defense, line, ran, from, the, seaside, resort, of, chorrillos, through, morro, solar, santa, teresa, san, juan, the, pamplona, hills, until, monterrico, chico, a, line, of, defence, approximately, 15, km, long, gatling, guns, artillery, covering, forts, and, trenches, located, along, the, top, of, the, steeply, natural, hills, 280, m, in, morro, solar, 170, m, in, sta, teresa, and, san, juan, 253, and, minefields, around, the, roads, to, lima, crossing, the, hamlets, of, san, juan, and, santa, teresa, settlements, that, the, peruvians, anticipated, would, be, important, targets, of, the, chilean, attack, all, of, which, were, used, by, the, peruvian, military, the, second, line, of, defense, was, less, strong, consisting, of, 7, redoubts, one, every, 800, meters, for, infantry, and, artillery, which, the, peruvians, hoped, would, stop, any, chilean, offensive, the, chilean, general, staff, had, two, plans, for, the, attack, baquedano, the, army, chief, advocated, a, direct, and, frontal, advance, through, the, tablada, de, lur, n, the, area, was, known, with, large, areas, of, relatively, flat, terrain, against, the, line, of, chorrillos, the, advantages, of, that, path, of, advance, were, the, shorter, distances, to, be, covered, a, withdrawal, line, the, possibility, of, support, from, the, chilean, navy, water, supply, from, lur, n, and, less, need, to, train, troops, and, the, complex, chilean, discipline, to, control, any, advance, and, subsequent, attack, the, alternative, plan, of, war, minister, jos, francisco, vergara, laid, down, a, turning, movement, that, would, bypass, the, peruvian, line, by, attacking, from, further, to, the, east, through, the, lur, n, valley, moving, via, chantay, and, reaching, lima, at, ate, using, that, approach, meant, that, lima, could, be, seized, without, resistance, or, both, defense, lines, could, be, attacked, from, the, rear, vergara, s, plan, avoided, the, bloody, frontal, attack, circumvented, all, defense, works, cut, any, peruvian, withdrawal, line, to, the, east, into, the, formidable, andes, and, demoralized, the, peruvians, however, there, were, no, steady, roads, for, movement, of, chilean, artillery, and, baggage, no, water, to, allow, navy, support, and, many, bottlenecks, in, which, a, small, force, might, stop, the, whole, chilean, army, on, the, way, to, lima, or, if, it, had, to, withdraw, in, addition, vergara, s, plan, required, a, well, trained, and, disciplined, army, baquedano, pushed, and, eventually, succeeded, in, having, his, plan, adopted, in, the, afternoon, of, 12, january, 1881, three, chilean, formations, referred, to, as, divisions, stepped, off, from, lur, n, toward, chorrillos, at, about, 4, 00, reaching, their, attack, positions, at, around, 3, 00, the, next, morning, at, 5, 00, a, m, an, assault, was, begun, on, the, peruvian, forts, lynch, s, division, charged, iglesias, s, positions, morro, solar, to, santa, teresa, sotomayor, s, men, against,

combat, and, attacked, one, another, with, rifles, bayonets, rocks, and, even, their, bare, hands, at, the, beginning, sotomayor, was, unable, to, deploy, in, time, and, lynch, s, advance, was, repulsed, baquedano, was, forced, to, throw, in, reserve, brigades, to, salvage, lynch, s, flank, at, 8, 00, a, m, the, peruvian, defenders, were, forced, to, withdraw, from, san, juan, and, santa, teresa, to, morro, solar, and, chorrillos, town, at, noon, morro, solar, was, captured, and, the, battle, continued, into, chorrillos, which, fell, at, 14, 00, 2, p, m, during, the, battle, of, chorrillos, the, chileans, inflicted, a, harsh, defeat, on, the, regular, peruvian, forces, eliminating, lima, s, first, defensive, line, two, days, later, the, second, line, of, defense, was, also, penetrated, in, the, battle, of, miraflores, pi, rola, s, division, of, forces, in, two, lines, has, been, criticised, by, chilean, analyst, francisco, machuca, 361, whether, such, criticism, is, justified, is, debatable, according, to, gonzalo, bulnes, the, battles, of, chorrillos, and, miraflores, have, been, some, of, the, largest, in, south, america, regarding, the, number, of, combatants, 45, 000, in, chorrillos, and, 25, 000, in, miraflores, the, estimated, death, toll, was, 11, 000, to, 14, 000, personnel, with, a, further, 10, 144, injured, on, 15, june, 1881, domingo, santa, mar,

the, war, and, pleaded, for, monetary, indemnification, instead, of, cession, of, territories, to, chile, there, was, a, strong, drift, in, its, public, opinion, in, favor, of, peru, and, bolivia, moreover, there, were, peruvian, and, bolivian, hopes, that, argentina, could, change, its, stance, and, enter, a, war, against, chile, on, 23, july, 1881, a, few, months, after, the, fall, of, lima, chile, and, argentina, signed, the, boundary, treaty, which, ceded, eastern, patagonia, to, argentina, and, control, over, the, strait, of, magellan, to, chile, carlos, escud, and, andr, s, cisneros, state, that, the, treaty, was, a, true, victory, for, argentina, but, michael, morris, believes, rearguard, argentine, efforts, had, been, made, to, gain, recognition, for, some, kind, of, shared, management, regime, for, the, strait, in, order, to, mitigate, what, was, perceived, as, the, striking, diplomatic, defeat, for, argentina, in, the, 1881, treaty, granting, chile, control, over, the, strait, the, situation, in, bolivia, stayed, the, same, after, the, fall, of, lima, the, bolivian, government, lacked, the, money, men, weapons, and, means, to, transport, an, army, to, peru, 115,

expectations, neither, lima, s, capture, nor, the, imposition, of, heavy, taxes, led, peru, to, sue, for, peace, conversely, peruvian, caudillos, advocated, to, wage, a, defensive, war, of, attrition, that, consumed, chile, s, power, so, much, that, it, renounced, their, demand, for, the, territory, on, 22, february, 1881, the, pi, rola, congress, allowed, by, chile, reinstated, the, 1860, constitution, and, chose, francisco, garc, a, calder, n, as, the, provisional, president, but, he, was, assisted, by, the, us, minister, in, lima, in, refusing, the, cession, of, territories, to,

and, their, property, confiscated, most, of, them, having, to, shelter, in, the, camps, boats, and, pontoons, of, the, peruvian, ports, until, they, were, transported, by, ship, to, antofagasta, it, is, calculated, that, 7, 000, of, the, refugees, from, peru, enlisted, in, the, chilean, battalions, and, their, resentfulness, would, later, influence, the, war, peruvian, and, bolivian, residents, in, chile, were, not, expelled, both, sides, complained, that, the, other, side, had, killed, wounded, soldiers, after, the, battle, and, cited, eyewitness, accounts, 8, besides, the, peruvian,

army, could, forcibly, suppress, the, revolt, chinese, coolies, formed, the, battalion, vulcano, within, the, chilean, army, there, were, also, interethnic, tensions, under, blacks, and, coolies, for, example, in, ca, ete, 2000, coolies, from, the, haciendas, montalb, n, and, juan, de, arona, were, massacred, by, blacks, the, british, historian, b, farcau, stated, contrary, to, the, concept, of, the, merchants, of, death, the, arms, manufacturers, of, europe, and, the, united, states, conniving, to, keep, alive, the, conflict, from, which, they, had, earned, some, welcome, sales, of, their, merchandise, the, most, influential, foreign, businessmen, and, their, respective, consuls, and, ambassadors, were, the, traders, in, nitrate, and, the, holders, of, the, growing, stacks, of, debts, of, all, the, belligerents, they, were, all, aware, that, the, only, way, they, could, hope, to, receive, payment, on, their, loans, and, earn, the, profits, from, the, nitrate, business, was, to, see, the, war, ended, and, trade, resumed, on, a, normal, footing, without, legal, disputes, over, ownership, of, the, resources, of, the, region, hanging, over, their, heads, nonethelesses, belligerents, were, able, to, purchase, torpedo, boats, arms, and, munitions, abroad, and, to, circumvent, ambiguous, neutrality, laws, and, firms, like, baring, brothers, in, london, were, not, averse, to, dealing, with, both, chile, and, peru, 129, arms, were, sold, freely, to, any, side, that, could, pay, for, them, but, the, british, abstained, from, selling, warships, for, example, in, 1879, to, 1880, peru, acquired, weapons, from, the, united, states, europe, costa, rica, and, panama, weapons, offloaded, on, the, caribbean, coast, of, panama, were, sent, overland, to, the, pacific, coast, by, the, isthmus, railway, in, the, pacific, a, number, of, ships, including, the, talism, n, chalaco, lime, a, estrella, enriqueta, and, guadiana, transported, the, cargo, to, peru, the, trade, was, done, with, the, consent, of, the, president, of, the, sovereign, state, of, panam, then, part, of, colombia, the, chilean, consul, in, panama, persistently, protested, the, trade, by, citing, a, chile, colombia, agreement, of, 1844, that, prohibited, colombia, from, providing, war, supplies, to, chile, s, enemies, after, the, chilean, occupation, of, arica, tarapac, and, antofagasta, the, governments, of, peru, and, bolivia, turned, as, their, last, hope, to, the, united, states, to, block, the, chilean, annexation, of, the, occupied, territories, 41, american, diplomats, were, worried, that, european, powers, might, be, tempted, to, intervene, in, the, pacific, the, bolivian, minister, in, washington, offered, us, secretary, of, state, william, maxwell, evarts, the, prospects, of, lucrative, guano, and, nitrate, concessions, to, american, investors, in, return, for, official, protection, of, bolivia, s, territorial, integrity, 131, 42, isaac, p, christiancy, us, minister, in, peru, organized, the, uss, lackwanna, conference, which, ultimately, failed, as, none, of, the, belligerents, was, ready, to, negotiate, earlier, christiancy, had, written, to, the, us, that, peru, should, be, annexed, for, ten, years, and, then, admitted, in, the, union, to, provide, the, united, states, with, access, to, the, rich, markets, of, south, america, 42, in, 1881, us, president, james, garfield, took, the, oath, of, office, and, the, anglophobic, secretary, of, state, james, g, blaine, supported, an, assertive, role, for, the, us, in, the, war, 43, ostensibly, regarding, the, interests, of, promoting, us, ownership, of, nitrate, and, guano, concessions, 132, blaine, argued, that, the, south, american, republics, are, young, sisters, of, this, government, and, so, he, would, not, tolerate, european, intervention, in, south, america, the, groups, credit, industriel, and, peruvian, company, representing, european, and, american, creditors, had, guaranteed, to, the, peruvian, provisional, government, of, francisco, garc, a, calder, n, to, pay, the, peruvian, external, debt, and, the, reparations, to, chile, but, in, return, the, peruvian, government, had, to, grant, mining, concessions, in, tarapac, to, these, corporations, with, the, acquiescence, of, garc, a, calder, n, both, companies, began, to, lobby, in, the, united, states, for, the, territories, to, remain, under, peruvian, sovereignty, for, example, the, us, levi, p, morton, bliss, and, company, would, get, a, monopoly, on, the, sales, of, peruvian, nitrate, in, the, us, beside, the, economic, plans, stephen, a, hurlbut, christiancy, s, successor, had, negotiated, with, garc, a, calder, n, the, cession, to, the, us, of, a, naval, base, in, chimbote, and, the, railroads, to, the, coal, mines, upcountry, when, it, became, known, that, blaine, s, representative, in, peru, hurlbut, would, personally, profit, from, the, settlement, it, was, clear, he, was, complicating, the, peace, process, the, american, attempts, reinforced, garcia, calderon, s, refusal, to, discuss, the, matter, of, territorial, cession, blaine, then, dispatched, william, h, trescot, in, a, mission, to, chile, to, establish, that, problems, would, be, resolved, through, arbitration, and, that, acts, of, war, would, not, justify, territorial, seizures, 132, after, the, assassination, of, garfield, 2, july, 1881, and, the, accession, of, chester, a, arthur, to, the, us, presidency, blaine, was, replaced, by, frederick, theodore, frelinghuysen, as, secretary, of, state, frelinghuysen, thought, that, the, us, was, in, no, position, to, back, blaine, s, policy, and, recalled, the, trescot, mission, kenneth, d, lehmann, commented, the, us, policy, regarding, a, british, intervention, in, the, war, the, british, historian, victor, kiernan, had, stated, it, should, be, emphasized, that, the, foreign, office, never, at, any, time, contemplated, any, kind, of, active, intervention, it, was, especially, scrupulous, in, seeing, to, it, that, no, warships, were, smuggled, out, for, sale, to, either, side, for, it, was, in, mortal, dread, of, another, alabama, award, during, the, war, the, british, government, embargoed, four, warships, sold, to, chile, and, per, the, case, of, looting, and, war, reparations, done, by, chilean, occupation, forces, in, peru, has, caused, controversy, between, historians, it, is, overlooked, in, chile, and, a, source, of, anti, chilean, sentiment, in, peru, the, chilean, historian, milton, godoy, orellana, distinguishes, the, looting, after, the, battle, of, chorrillos, y, miraflores, the, looting, by, peruvians, in, lima, before, the, chilean, troops, entered, the, city, and, the, chilean, destruction, of, locomotives, rails, printing, machines, weapons, etc, the, chilean, government, tried, to, control, it, through, the, oficina, recaudadora, de, las, contribuciones, de, guerra, whose, tasks, were, to, inventory, and, realize, the, confiscation, and, to, record, and, to, confirm, transport, to, chile, the, destination, and, the, sender, allegedly, the, strategic, purposes, were, to, obtain, the, peace, there, is, no, general, list, of, the, looted, goods, but, many, of, the, shipments, were, registered, in, private, and, official, letters, newspaper, articles, manifests, etc, also, looting, of, cultural, assets, of, peru, by, the, chileans, and, peruvians, occurred, the, development, of, international, law, regarding, the, protection, of, cultural, objects, evolved, over, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, but, the, idea, of, protecting, cultural, assets, first, emerged, in, europe, in, the, 18th, century, the, lieber, code, of, 1863, unconditionally, protected, works, of, art, during, an, armed, conflict, art, 35, but, expressly, consented, to, the, use, of, cultural, property, as, war, reparations, art, 36, in, fact, sergio, villalobos, states, that, in, 1817, the, us, accepted, the, confiscation, of, art, works, but, the, 1874, project, of, an, international, declaration, concerning, the, laws, and, customs, of, war, asserted, that, the, cultural, assets, were, to, be, considered, as, protected, in, march, 1881, the, chilean, government, began, to, seize, the, biblioteca, nacional, del, per, and, 45, 000, books, were, seized, but, some, of, the, books, were, sold, in, lima, by, peruvians, and, so, it, is, contested, how, much, of, the, booty, was, taken, by, the, chilean, forces, in, any, case, in, late, march, 1881, some, of, the, books, arrived, to, chile, and, the, press, began, to, inform, and, discuss, about, the, legitimacy, of, looting, oil, paintings, books, statues, etc, or, international, robbery, as, a, journalist, of, la, epoca, described, it, on, 4, january, 1883, in, a, session, of, the, chilean, congress, the, deputy, augusto, matte, p, rez, questioned, minister, of, the, interior, jos, manuel, balmaceda, on, the, opprobrious, and, humiliating, shipments, of, peruvian, cultural, assets, montt, asked, the, devolution, of, the, assets, and, was, supported, by, deputies, mcclure, and, puelma, the, minister, vowed, to, impede, further, exactions, and, to, repatriate, the, objects, mentioned, in, the, discussion, apparently, he, did, so, since, the, shipments, stopped, and, the, mentioned, statues, are, not, there, anymore, but, it, was, not, until, november, 2007, that, chile, returned, 3, 778, stolen, books, to, the, biblioteca, nacional, del, per, s, villalobos, asserted, there, was, no, justification, for, the, theft, another, issue, was, the, damage, from, acts, of, war, on, properties, owned, by, citizens, of, neutral, countries, in, 1884, the, tribunales, arbitrales, were, constituted, with, a, chilean, judge, who, was, named, by, the, country, of, the, claimant, as, well, as, a, brazilian, judge, to, deal, with, the, claims, of, citizens, from, britain, 118, claims, italy, 440, claims, and, france, 89, claims, a, tribunal, was, established, in, 1886, for, german, citizens, the, italian, tribunal, also, dealt, with, belgian, citizens, and, the, german, tribunal, acted, for, austrian, and, swiss, citizens, spaniards, accepted, the, decision, of, the, chilean, state, without, the, tribunal, s, assistance, and, the, us, did, not, agree, at, the, time, according, to, international, law, animus, manendi, claims, by, foreign, citizens, could, not, be, made, unless, the, damaged, property, had, been, in, an, actual, battleground, such, as, arica, chorrillos, and, miraflores, with, pisagua, and, tacna, being, in, a, similar, situation, but, damages, caused, by, individual, or, scattered, soldiers, were, dismissed, only, 3, 6, 1, 080, 562, chilean, pesos, of, the, value, that, was, claimed, was, recognized, by, the, tribunals, according, to, villalobos, the, verdicts, proved, that, the, accusations, against, the, chilean, forces, had, been, exaggerated, by, peruvians, because, of, their, wounded, pride, and, by, foreign, citizens, because, of, monetary, interests, the, war, had, a, profound, and, longlasting, effect, on, the, societies, of, all, countries, involved, the, negotiations, concerning, territorial, cessions, continued, until, 1929, but, the, war, ended, in, 1884, for, all, practical, purposes, various, authors, have, referred, to, the, war, as, a, trauma, for, peru, and, bolivia, ever, since, the, war, ended, the, aspiration, to, regain, coastal, sovereignty, has, been, a, recurring, theme, in, bolivia, s, domestic, and, foreign, policy, as, well, as, a, common, cause, of, tensions, with, chile, even, in, the, current, century, there, have, been, periods, when, diplomatic, relations, break, off, and, demands, are, placed, in, international, courts, bolivia, included, in, its, 2009, constitution, an, inalienable, right, to, the, currently, chilean, territories, however, these, allegations, against, the, existing, treaties, have, not, been, supported, by, the, international, court, of, justice, in, the, bolivian, demand, against, chile, before, the, hague, relations, between, chile, and, peru, after, the, treaty, of, lima, have, been, more, cordial, than, between, chile, and, bolivia, although, there, have, been, diplomatic, frictions, however, both, nations, maintain, continuous, diplomatic, relations, cooperate, in, international, trade, are, part, of, the, pacific, alliance, to, promote, mutual, integration, and, joint, strategic, trade, in, asia, and, invest, extensively, in, each, other, this, has, generated, rapid, growth, for, both, economies, and, a, growing, cultural, exchange, d, a, del, mar, is, celebrated, in, bolivia, on, 23, march, at, the, conclusion, of, the, weeklong, semana, del, mar, with, a, ceremony, at, la, paz, s, plaza, abaroa, in, homage, to, war, hero, eduardo, abaroa, and, in, parallel, ceremonies, nationwide, naval, glories, day, is, a, chilean, anniversary, that, commemorates, two, naval, battles, that, occurred, on, wednesday, 21, may, 1879, that, of, iquique, where, captain, of, frigate, arturo, prat, died, along, with, the, entire, crew, of, the, corvette, esmeralda, sunk, by, the, peruvian, monitor, hu, scar, built, in, the, united, kingdom, for, the, peruvian, government, in, 1864, it, served, in, the, peruvian, navy, until, it, was, captured, by, chile, in, 1879, under, the, command, of, captain, miguel, grau, and, that, of, punta, gruesa, where, the, schooner, covadonga, under, the, command, of, carlos, condell, ran, aground, the, peruvian, armored, frigate, independencia, under, the, command, of, juan, guillermo, more, in, the, rocks, of, punta, gruesa, even, though, the, 1873, treaty, and, the, imposition, of, the, 10, centavos, tax, proved, to, be, the, casus, belli, there, were, deeper, more, fundamental, reasons, for, the, outbreak, of, hostilities, in, 1879, on, the, one, hand, there, was, the, power, prestige, and, relative, stability, of, chile, compared, to, the, economic, deterioration, and, political, discontinuity, which, characterised, both, peru, and, bolivia, after, independence, on, the, other, there, was, the, ongoing, competition, for, economic, and, political, hegemony, in, the, region, complicated, by, a, deep, antipathy, between, peru, and, chile, in, this, milieu, the, vagueness, of, the, boundaries, between, the, three, states, coupled, with, the, discovery, of, valuable, guano, and, nitrate, deposits, in, the, disputed, territories, combined, to, produce, a, diplomatic, conundrum, of, insurmountable, proportions
