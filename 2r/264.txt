feudal, japan, they, were, often, employed, in, siege, espionage, missions, and, military, deception, they, often, appear, in, the, historical, record, during, the, sengoku, period, although, antecedents, may, have, existed, as, early, as, the, 12th, century, during, the, japan, s, warring, state, period, jizamurai, clans, of, peasant, warriors, in, iga, province, and, the, adjacent, k, ka, district, formed, ikki, revolts, or, leagues, as, a, means, of, self, defense, following, the, tokugawa, shogunate, in, the, 17th, century, the, ninja, faded, into, obscurity, a, number, of, shinobi, manuals, often, based, on, chinese, military, philosophy, were, written, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, most, notably, the, bansensh, kai, 1676, ninja, is, the, on, yomi, early, middle, chinese, influenced, the, two, kanji, in, the, native, kun, yomi, reading, it, is, pronounced, shinobi, a, shortened, form, of, shinobi, no, mono, the, word, shinobi, appears, in, the, written, record, as, far, back, as, the, late, 8th, century, in, poems, in, the, man, y, sh, the, underlying, connotation, of, shinobi, means, to, steal, away, to, hide, and, by, extension, to, forbear, hence, its, association, with, stealth, and, invisibility, mono, means, a, person, the, word, ninja, was, uncommon, and, a, variety, of, regional, colloquialisms, evolved, to, describe, what, would, later, be, dubbed, ninja, the, first, known, english, use, of, the, word, ninja, was, in, 1964, kunoichi, is, originally, an, argot, which, means, woman, p168, it, supposedly, comes, from, the, characters, respectively, hiragana, ku, katakana, no, and, kanji, ichi, which, make, up, the, form, of, kanji, for, woman, p168, in, fiction, written, in, the, modern, era, kunoichi, means, female, ninja, p167, by, the, time, of, the, meiji, restoration, in, 1868, shinobi, had, become, a, topic, of, popular, culture, in, japan, which, featured, in, many, legend, and, folklore, where, they, were, associated, with, many, supernatural, abilitiles, it, was, believed, the, espionage, activities, of, ninja, were, attributed, to, chinese, military, strategy, such, as, the, art, of, war, by, sun, tzu, according, to, traditional, evaluation, the, ninja, were, stealth, soldiers, and, mercenaries, hired, mostly, by, daimy, s, despite, many, popular, folktales, historical, accounts, of, the, ninja, are, scarce, historian, stephen, turnbull, asserts, that, the, ninja, were, mostly, recruited, from, the, lower, class, and, therefore, little, literary, interest, was, taken, in, them, the, social, origin, of, the, ninja, is, seen, as, the, reason, they, agree, to, operate, in, secret, trading, their, service, for, money, without, honor, and, glory, the, scarcity, of, historical, accounts, is, also, demonstrated, in, war, epics, such, as, the, tale, of, h, gen, h, gen, monogatari, and, the, tale, of, the, heike, heike, monogatari, which, focus, mainly, on, the, aristocratic, samurai, whose, deeds, were, apparently, more, appealing, to, the, audience, historian, kiyoshi, watatani, states, that, the, ninja, were, trained, to, be, particularly, secretive, about, their, actions, and, existence, so, called, ninjutsu, techniques, in, short, are, the, skills, of, shinobi, no, jutsu, and, shinobijutsu, which, have, the, aims, of, ensuring, that, one, s, opponent, does, not, know, of, one, s, existence, and, for, which, there, was, special, training, however, some, ninjutsu, books, described, specifically, what, tactics, ninja, should, use, to, fight, and, the, scenarios, in, which, a, ninja, might, find, themselves, can, be, deduced, from, those, tactics, for, example, in, the, manuscript, of, volume, 2, of, kanrin, seiy, which, is, the, original, book, of, bansensh, kai, there, are, 48, points, of, ninja, s, fighting, techniques, such, as, how, to, make, makibishi, from, bamboo, how, to, make, footwear, that, makes, no, sound, fighting, techniques, when, surrounded, by, many, enemies, precautions, when, using, swords, at, night, how, to, listen, to, small, sounds, kuji, kiri, that, prevents, guard, dogs, from, barking, and, more, later, in, history, the, k, ga, ninja, would, become, regarded, as, agents, of, the, tokugawa, bakufu, at, a, time, when, the, shogunate, used, the, ninja, in, an, intelligence, network, to, monitor, regional, daimy, s, as, well, as, the, imperial, court, during, this, time, there, are, some, definitive, terms, to, classify, their, activities, such, as, spying, kanch, scout, teisatsu, ambush, kishu, and, agitprop, konran, the, ninja, clans, organized, into, a, larger, confederation, with, their, own, respective, territories, a, system, of, rank, existed, a, j, nin, rank, upper, person, followed, by, the, ch, nin, rank,

trainees, also, studied, survival, poisons, and, explosives, physical, training, involved, long, distance, runs, climbing, and, stealth, methods, of, walking, training, in, techniques, of, disguise, was, also, taught, some, evidence, of, medical, training, can, be, derived, from, one, account, where, an, iga, ninja, provided, medical, attention, to, ii, naomasa, a, general, of, tokugawa, who, was, injured, by, gunfire, during, the, sekigahara, battle, the, skill, sets, of, ninja, agents, known, in, modern, times, as, ninjutsu, comprised, a, variety, of, espionage, and, survival, skills, with, each, its, own, unique, characteristic, for, each, ninjutsu, school, some, view, ninjutsu, as, evidence, that, ninja, were, not, simple, mercenaries, because, texts, contained, not, only, information, on, combat, training, but, also, information, about, daily, needs, which, even, included, mining, techniques, the, guidance, provided, for, daily, work, also, included, elements, that, enable, the, ninja, to, understand, the, martial, qualities, of, even, the, most, menial, task, these, factors, show, how, the, ninjutsu, established, among, the, ninja, class, the, fundamental, principle, of, adaptation, ninja, usually, worked, in, a, team, to, scale, a, wall, by, providing, a, human, platform, to, assist, their, team, members, in, reaching, the, top, of, the, wall, the, mikawa, go, fudoki, gives, an, account, of, a, coordinated, team, of, infiltrators, who, usually, made, use, of, passwords, to, communicate, so, they, could, recognize, their, allies, during, their, covert, operations, and, when, in, disguise, as, they, dressed, in, the, same, clothes, as, the, enemy, in, his, buke, my, mokush, military, historian, hanawa, hokinoichi, writes, of, the, ninja, that, they, travelled, in, disguise, into, foreign, territories, to, scout, enemy, forces, set, enemy, castles, on, fire, and, carry, out, assassinations, using, infiltration, tactics, espionage, was, the, chief, role, of, the, ninja, with, the, aid, of, disguises, the, ninja, gathered, information, on, enemy, terrain, and, building, specifications, as, well, as, obtaining, passwords, and, communiques, the, aforementioned, supplement, to, the, nochi, kagami, briefly, describes, the, ninja, s, role, in, espionage, as, stephen, turnbull, stated, that, the, iga, and, k, ka, ninja, usually, infiltrated, enemy, castles, turnbull, further, added, that, ninja, gained, notability, as, hired, mercenaries, during, the, 15th, century, to, use, many, asymmetrical, warfare, tactics, such, as, scouting, operations, raiding, operations, arson, and, even, terrorism, these, tactics, were, considered, abhorrent, by, members, of, the, samurai, class, during, the, sengoku, period, demands, for, such, unconventional, operations, increased, meanwhile, turnbull, also, stated, there, is, no, evidence, to, prove, that, ninja, were, actively, employed, as, professional, assassins, and, it, could, be, argued, that, they, were, just, hired, bandits, modern, historian, tatsuo, fujita, opined, that, based, on, the, historical, texts, in, 16th, century, by, naito, munekatsu, vassal, of, the, miyoshi, clan, ninja, warriors, were, actually, feared, as, mercenaries, who, were, proficient, in, the, castle, siege, warfare, buildings, were, constructed, with, traps, and, trip, wires, attached,

capturing, of, enemy, banners, can, be, seen, illustrated, in, the, u, eikei, gunki, in, which, a, ninja, once, stole, the, banner, of, samurai, lord, naoe, kanetsugu, and, hoisted, it, to, next, day, to, demoralize, kanetsugu, s, army, in, the, war, most, ninjutsu, techniques, recorded, in, scrolls, and, manuals, revolve, around, ways, to, avoid, detection, and, methods, of, escape, these, techniques, were, loosely, grouped, under, corresponding, natural, elements, some, examples, are, the, use, of, disguises, was, common, and, is, well, documented, ninjas, disguised, themselves, as,

of, ieyasu, had, suffered, roughly, 200, casualties, during, their, journey, from, osaka, however, modern, scholars, such, as, tatsuo, fujita, doubted, the, credibility, of, hattori, hanz, s, ninja,
