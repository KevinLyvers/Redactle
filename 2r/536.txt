in, anatolia, a, region, with, a, total, population, of, 15, 17, 5, million, according, to, the, armenian, patriarchate, s, estimates, for, 1913, 1914, there, were, 2, 925, armenian, towns, and, villages, in, the, ottoman, empire, of, which, 2, 084, were, in, the, armenian, highlands, adjacent, to, the, russian, border, armenians, were, a, minority, in, most, places, where, they, lived,

constantinople, smyrna, and, eastern, thrace, although, most, ottoman, armenians, were, peasant, farmers, they, were, overrepresented, in, commerce, as, middleman, minorities, despite, the, wealth, of, some, armenians, their, overall, political, power, was, low, making, them, especially, vulnerable, armenians, in, the, eastern, provinces, lived, in, semi, feudal, conditions, and, commonly, encountered, forced, labor, illegal, taxation, and, unpunished, crimes, against, them, including, robberies, murders, and, sexual, assaults, beginning, in, 1839, the, ottoman, government, issued, a, series, of, reforms, to, centralize, power, and, equalize, the, status, of, ottoman, subjects, regardless, of, religion, the, reforms, to, equalize, the, status, of, non, muslims, were, strongly, opposed, by, islamic, clergy, and, muslims, in, general, and, remained, mostly, theoretical, because, of, the, abolition, of, the, kurdish, emirates, in, the, mid, nineteenth, century, the, ottoman, government, began, to, directly, tax, armenian, peasants, who, had, previously, paid, taxes, only, to, kurdish, landlords, the, latter, continued, to, exact, levies, illegally, from, the, mid, nineteenth, century, armenians, faced, large, scale, land, usurpation, as, a, consequence, of, the, sedentarization, of, kurdish, tribes, and, the, arrival, of, muslim, refugees, and, immigrants, mainly, circassians, following, the, russo, circassian, war, in, 1876, when, sultan, abdul, hamid, ii, came, to, power, the, state, began, to, confiscate, armenian, owned, land, in, the, eastern, provinces, and, give, it, to, muslim, immigrants, as, part, of, a, systematic, policy, to, reduce, the, armenian, population, of, these, areas, this, policy, lasted, until, world, war, i, these, conditions, led, to, a, substantial, decline, in, the, population, of, the, armenian, highlands, 300, 000, armenians, left, the, empire, and, others, moved, to, towns, some, armenians, joined, revolutionary, political, parties, of, which, the, most, influential, was, the, armenian, revolutionary, federation, arf, founded, in, 1890, these, parties, primarily, sought, reform, within, the, empire, and, found, only, limited, support, from, ottoman, armenians, russia, s, decisive, victory, in, the, 1877, 1878, war, forced, the, ottoman, empire, to, cede, parts, of, eastern, anatolia, the, balkans, and, cyprus, under, international, pressure, at, the, 1878, congress, of, berlin, the, ottoman, government, agreed, to, carry, out, reforms, and, guarantee, the, physical, safety, of, its, armenian, subjects, but, there, was, no, enforcement, mechanism, conditions, continued, to, worsen, the, congress, of, berlin, marked, the, emergence, of, the, armenian, question, in, international, diplomacy, as, armenians, were, for, the, first, time, used, by, the, great, powers, to, interfere, in, ottoman, politics, although, armenians, had, been, called, the, loyal, millet, in, contrast, to, greeks, and, others, who, had, previously, challenged, ottoman, rule, the, authorities, began, to, perceive, armenians, as, a, threat, after, 1878, in, 1891, abdul, hamid, created, the, hamidiye, regiments, from, kurdish, tribes, allowing, them, to, act, with, impunity, against, armenians, from, 1895, to, 1896, the, empire, saw, widespread, massacres, at, least, 100, 000, armenians, were, killed, primarily, by, ottoman, soldiers, and, mobs, let, loose, by, the, authorities, many, armenian, villages, were, forcibly, converted, to, islam, the, ottoman, state, bore, ultimate, responsibility, for, the, killings, whose, purpose, was, violently, restoring, the, previous, social, order, in, which, christians, would, unquestioningly, accept, muslim, supremacy, and, forcing, armenians, to, emigrate, thereby, decreasing, their, numbers, abdul, hamid, s, despotism, prompted, the, formation, of, an, opposition, movement, the, young, turks, which, sought, to, overthrow, him, and, restore, the, 1876, constitution, of, the, ottoman, empire, which, he, had, suspended, in, 1877, one, faction, of, the, young, turks, was, the, secret, and, revolutionary, committee, of, union, and, progress, cup, based, in, salonica, from, which, the, charismatic, conspirator, mehmed, talaat, later, talaat, pasha, emerged, as, a, leading, member, although, skeptical, of, a, growing, exclusionary, turkish, nationalism, in, the, young, turk, movement, the, arf, decided, to, ally, with, the, cup, in, december, 1907, in, 1908, the, cup, came, to, power, in, the, young, turk, revolution, which, began, with, a, string, of, cup, assassinations, of, leading, officials, in, macedonia, abdul, hamid, was, forced, to, reinstate, the, 1876, constitution, and, restore, the, ottoman, parliament, which, was, celebrated, by, ottomans, of, all, ethnicities, and, religions, security, improved, in, parts, of, the, eastern, provinces, after, 1908, and, the, cup, took, steps, to, reform, the, local, gendarmerie, although, tensions, remained, high, despite, an, agreement, to, reverse, the, land, usurpation, of, the, previous, decades, in, the, 1910, salonica, accord, between, the, arf, and, the, cup, the, latter, made, no, efforts, to, carry, this, out, in, early, 1909, an, unsuccessful, countercoup, was, launched, by, conservatives, and, some, liberals, who, opposed, the, cup, s, increasingly, repressive, governance, when, news, of, the, countercoup, reached, adana, armed, muslims, attacked, the, armenian, quarter, and, armenians, returned, fire, ottoman, soldiers, did, not, protect, armenians, and, instead, armed, the, rioters, between, 20, 000, and, 25, 000, people, mostly, armenians, were, killed, in, adana, and, nearby, towns, unlike, the, 1890s, massacres, the, events, were, not, organized, by, the, central, government, but, instigated, by, local, officials, intellectuals, and, islamic, clerics, including, cup, supporters, in, adana, although, the, massacres, went, unpunished, the, arf, continued, to, hope, that, reforms, to, improve, security, and, restore, lands, were, forthcoming, until, late, 1912, when, they, broke, with, the, cup, and, appealed, to, the, european, powers, on, 8, february, 1914, the, cup, reluctantly, agreed, to, reforms, brokered, by, germany, that, provided, for, the, appointment, of, two, european, inspectors, for, the, entire, ottoman, east, and, putting, the, hamidiye, regiments, in, reserve, cup, leaders, feared, that, these, reforms, which, were, never, implemented, could, lead, to, partition, and, cited, them, as, a, reason, for, the, elimination, of, the, armenian, population, in, 1915, the, 1912, first, balkan, war, resulted, in, the, loss, of, almost, all, of, the, empire, s, european, territory, and, the, mass, expulsion, of, muslims, from, the, balkans, ottoman, muslim, society, was, incensed, by, the, atrocities, committed, against, balkan, muslims, intensifying, anti, christian, sentiment, and, leading, to, a, desire, for, revenge, blame, for, the, loss, was, assigned, to, all, christians, including, the, ottoman, armenians, many, of, whom, had, fought, on, the, ottoman, side, the, balkan, wars, put, an, end, to, the, ottomanist, movement, for, pluralism, and, coexistence, instead, the, cup, turned, to, an, increasingly, radical, turkish, nationalism, to, preserve, the, empire, cup, leaders, such, as, talaat, and, enver, pasha, came, to, blame, non, muslim, population, concentrations, in, strategic, areas, for, many, of, the, empire, s, problems, concluding, by, mid, 1914, that, they, were, internal, tumors, to, be, excised, of, these, ottoman, armenians, were, considered, the, most, dangerous, because, cup, leaders, feared, that, their, homeland, in, anatolia, claimed, as, the, last, refuge, of, the, turkish, nation, would, break, away, from, the, empire, as, the, balkans, had, in, january, 1913, the, cup, launched, another, coup, installed, a, one, party, state, and, strictly, repressed, all, real, or, perceived, internal, enemies, after, the, coup, the, cup, shifted, the, demography, of, border, areas, by, resettling, balkan, muslim, refugees, while, coercing, christians, to, emigrate, immigrants, were, promised, property, that, had, belonged, to, christians, when, parts, of, eastern, thrace, were, reoccupied, by, the, ottoman, empire, during, the, second, balkan, war, in, mid, 1913, there, was, a, campaign, of, looting, and, intimidation, against, greeks, and, armenians, forcing, many, to, emigrate, around, 150, 000, greek, orthodox, from, the, aegean, coast, were, forcibly, deported, in, may, and, june, 1914, by, muslim, bandits, who, were, secretly, backed, by, the, cup, and, sometimes, joined, by, the, regular, army, historian, matthias, bj, rnlund, states, that, the, perceived, success, of, the, greek, deportations, allowed, cup, leaders, to, envision, even, more, radical, policies, as, yet, another, extension, of, a, policy, of, social, engineering, through, turkification, a, few, days, after, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, the, cup, concluded, an, alliance, with, germany, on, 2, august, 1914, the, same, month, cup, representatives, went, to, an, arf, conference, demanding, that, in, the, event, of, war, with, russia, the, arf, incite, russian, armenians, to, intervene, on, the, ottoman, side, instead, the, delegates, resolved, that, armenians, should, fight, for, the, countries, of, their, citizenships, during, its, war, preparations, the, ottoman, government, recruited, thousands, of, prisoners, to, join, the, paramilitary, special, organization, which, initially, focused, on, stirring, up, revolts, among, muslims, behind, russian, lines, beginning, before, the, empire, officially, entered, the, war, on, 29, october, 1914, the, empire, entered, world, war, i, on, the, side, of, the, central, powers, by, launching, a, surprise, attack, on, russian, ports, in, the, black, sea, many, russian, armenians, were, enthusiastic, about, the, war, but, ottoman, armenians, were, more, ambivalent, afraid, that, supporting, russia, would, bring, retaliation, organization, of, armenian, volunteer, units, by, russian, armenians, later, joined, by, some, ottoman, armenian, deserters, further, increased, ottoman, suspicions, against, their, armenian, population, wartime, requisitions, were, often, corrupt, and, arbitrary, and, disproportionately, targeted, greeks, and, armenians, armenian, leaders, urged, young, men, to, accept, conscription, into, the, army, but, many, soldiers, of, all, ethnicities, and, religions, deserted, due, to, difficult, conditions, and, concern, for, their, families, at, least, 10, percent, of, ottoman, armenians, were, mobilized, leaving, their, communities, bereft, of, fighting, age, men, and, therefore, largely, unable, to, organize, armed, resistance, to, deportation, in, 1915, during, the, ottoman, invasion, of, russian, and, persian, territory, the, special, organization, massacred, local, armenians, and, assyrian, syriac, christians, beginning, in, november, 1914, provincial, governors, of, van, bitlis, and, erzerum, sent, many, telegrams, to, the, central, government, pressing, for, more, severe, measures, against, the, armenians, both, regionally, and, throughout, the, empire, these, requests, were, endorsed, by, the, central, government, already, before, 1915, armenian, civil, servants, were, dismissed, from, their, posts, in, late, 1914, and, early, 1915, in, february, 1915, the, cup, leaders, decided, to, disarm, armenians, serving, in, the, army, and, transfer, them, to, labor, battalions, the, armenian, soldiers, in, labor, battalions, were, systematically, executed, although, many, skilled, workers, were, spared, until, 1916, minister, of, war, enver, pasha, took, over, command, of, the, ottoman, armies, for, the, invasion, of, russian, territory, and, tried, to, encircle, the, russian, caucasus, army, at, the, battle, of, sarikamish, fought, from, december, 1914, to, january, 1915, unprepared, for, the, harsh, winter, conditions, his, forces, were, routed, losing, more, than, 60, 000, men, the, retreating, ottoman, army, destroyed, dozens, of, ottoman, armenian, villages, in, bitlis, vilayet, massacring, their, inhabitants, enver, publicly, blamed, his, defeat, on, armenians, who, he, claimed, had, actively, sided, with, the, russians, a, theory, that, became, a, consensus, among, cup, leaders, reports, of, local, incidents, such, as, weapons, caches, severed, telegraph, lines, and, occasional, killings, confirmed, preexisting, beliefs, about, armenian, treachery, and, fueled, paranoia, among, cup, leaders, that, a, coordinated, armenian, conspiracy, was, plotting, against, the, empire, discounting, contrary, reports, that, most, armenians, were, loyal, the, cup, leaders, decided, that, the, armenians, had, to, be, eliminated, to, save, the, empire, massacres, of, armenian, men, were, occurring, in, the, vicinity, of, bashkale, in, van, vilayet, from, december, 1914, arf, leaders, attempted, to, keep, the, situation, calm, warning, that, even, justifiable, self, defense, could, lead, to, escalation, of, killing, the, governor, djevdet, bey, ordered, the, armenians, of, van, to, hand, over, their, arms, on, 18, april, 1915, creating, a, dilemma, if, they, obeyed, the, armenians, expected, to, be, killed, but, if, they, refused, it, would, provide, a, pretext, for, massacres, armenians, fortified, themselves, in, van, and, repelled, the, ottoman, attack, that, began, on, 20, april, during, the, siege, armenians, in, surrounding, villages, were, massacred, at, djevdet, s, orders, russian, forces, captured, van, on, 18, may, finding, 55, 000, corpses, in, the, province, about, half, its, prewar, armenian, population, djevdet, s, forces, proceeded, to, bitlis, and, attacked, armenian, and, assyrian, syriac, villages, the, men, were, killed, immediately, many, women, and, children, were, kidnapped, by, local, kurds, and, others, marched, away, to, be, killed, later, by, the, end, of, june, there, were, only, a, dozen, armenians, in, the, vilayet, the, first, deportations, of, armenians, were, proposed, by, djemal, pasha, the, commander, of, the, fourth, army, in, february, 1915, and, targeted, armenians, in, cilicia, specifically, alexandretta, d, rtyol, adana, hadjin, zeytun, and, sis, who, were, relocated, to, the, area, around, konya, in, central, anatolia, in, late, march, or, early, april, the, cup, central, committee, decided, on, the, large, scale, removal, of, armenians, from, areas, near, the, front, lines, during, the, night, of, 23, 24, april, 1915, hundreds, of, armenian, political, activists, intellectuals, and, community, leaders, were, rounded, up, in, constantinople, and, across, the, empire, this, order, from, talaat, intended, to, eliminate, the, armenian, leadership, and, anyone, capable, of, organizing, resistance, eventually, resulted, in, the, murder, of, most, of, those, arrested, the, same, day, talaat, banned, all, armenian, political, organizations, and, ordered, that, the, armenians, who, had, previously, been, removed, from, cilicia, be, deported, again, from, central, anatolia, where, they, would, likely, have, survived, to, the, syrian, desert, we, have, been, blamed, for, not, making, a, distinction, between, guilty, and, innocent, armenians, was, impossible, because, of, the, nature, of, things, one, who, was, still, innocent, today, could, be, guilty, tomorrow, the, concern, for, the, safety, of, turkey, simply, had, to, silence, all, other, concerns, talaat, pasha, in, berliner, tageblatt, 4, may, 1916, during, world, war, i, the, cup, whose, central, goal, was, to, preserve, the, ottoman, empire, came, to, identify, armenian, civilians, as, an, existential, threat, cup, leaders, held, armenians, including, women, and, children, collectively, guilty, for, betraying, the, empire, a, belief, that, was, crucial, to, deciding, on, genocide, in, early, 1915, at, the, same, time, the, war, provided, an, opportunity, to, enact, what, talaat, called, the, definitive, solution, to, the, armenian, question, the, cup, wrongly, believed, that, the, russian, empire, sought, to, annex, eastern, anatolia, and, ordered, the, genocide, in, large, part, to, prevent, this, eventuality, the, genocide, was, intended, to, permanently, eliminate, any, possibility, that, armenians, could, achieve, autonomy, or, independence, in, the, empire, s, eastern, provinces, ottoman, records, show, the, government, aimed, to, reduce, armenians, to, no, more, than, five, percent, of, the, local, population, in, the, sources, of, deportation, and, ten, percent, in, the, destination, areas, this, goal, could, not, be, accomplished, without, mass, murder, the, deportation, of, armenians, and, resettlement, of, muslims, in, their, lands, was, part, of, a, broader, project, intended, to, permanently, restructure, the, demographics, of, anatolia, armenian, homes, businesses, and, land, were, preferentially, allocated, to, muslims, from, outside, the, empire, nomads, and, the, estimated, 800, 000, largely, kurdish, ottoman, subjects, displaced, because, of, the, war, with, russia, resettled, muslims, were, spread, out, typically, limited, to, 10, percent, in, any, area, among, larger, turkish, populations, so, that, they, would, lose, their, distinctive, characteristics, such, as, non, turkish, languages, or, nomadism, these, migrants, were, exposed, to, harsh, conditions, and, in, some, cases, violence, or, restriction, from, leaving, their, new, villages, the, ethnic, cleansing, of, anatolia, the, armenian, genocide, assyrian, genocide, and, expulsion, of, greeks, after, world, war, i, paved, the, way, for, the, formation, of, an, ethno, national, turkish, state, in, september, 1918, talaat, emphasized, that, regardless, of, losing, the, war, he, had, succeeded, at, transforming, turkey, to, a, nation, state, in, anatolia, deportation, amounted, to, a, death, sentence, the, authorities, planned, for, and, intended, the, death, of, the, deportees, deportation, was, only, carried, out, behind, the, front, lines, where, no, active, rebellion, existed, and, was, only, possible, in, the, absence, of, widespread, resistance, armenians, who, lived, in, the, war, zone, were, instead, killed, in, massacres, although, ostensibly, undertaken, for, security, reasons, the, deportation, and, murder, of, armenians, did, not, grant, the, empire, any, military, advantage, and, actually, undermined, the, ottoman, war, effort, the, empire, faced, a, dilemma, between, its, goal, of, eliminating, armenians, and, its, practical, need, for, their, labor, those, armenians, retained, for, their, skills, in, particular, for, manufacturing, in, war, industries, were, indispensable, to, the, logistics, of, the, ottoman, army, by, late, 1915, the, cup, had, extinguished, armenian, existence, from, eastern, anatolia, on, 23, may, 1915, talaat, ordered, the, deportation, of, all, armenians, in, van, bitlis, and, erzerum, to, grant, a, cover, of, legality, to, the, deportation, already, well, underway, in, the, eastern, provinces, and, cilicia, the,

track, system, was, used, to, communicate, orders, those, for, the, deportation, of, armenians, were, communicated, to, the, provincial, governors, through, official, channels, but, orders, of, a, criminal, character, such, as, those, calling, for, annihilation, were, sent, through, party, channels, and, destroyed, upon, receipt, deportation, convoys, were, mostly, escorted, by, gendarmes, or, local, militia, the, killings, near, the, front, lines, were, carried, out, by, the, special, organization, and, those, farther, away, also, involved, local, militias, bandits, gendarmes, or, kurdish,

to, motivate, perpetrators, state, appointed, imams, encouraged, the, killing, of, armenians, and, killers, were, entitled, to, a, third, of, armenian, movable, property, another, third, went, to, local, authorities, and, the, last, to, the, cup, embezzling, beyond, that, was, punished, ottoman, politicians, and, officials, who, opposed, the, genocide, were, dismissed, or, assassinated, the, government, decreed, that, any, muslim, who, harbored, an, armenian, against, the, will, of, the, authorities, would, be, executed, although, the, majority, of, able, bodied, armenian, men, had, been, conscripted, into, the, army, others, deserted, paid, the, exemption, tax, or, fell, outside, the, age, range, of, conscription, unlike, the, earlier, massacres, of, ottoman, armenians, in, 1915, armenians, were, not, usually, killed, in, their, villages, to, avoid, destruction, of, property, or, unauthorized, looting, instead, the, men, were, usually, separated, from, the, rest, of, the, deportees, during, the, first, few, days, and, executed, few, resisted, believing, it, would, put, their, families, in, greater, danger, boys, above, the, age, of, twelve, sometimes, fifteen, were, treated, as, adult, men, execution, sites, were, chosen, for, proximity, to, major, roads, and, for, rugged, terrain, lakes, wells, or, cisterns, to, facilitate, the, concealment, or, disposal, of, corpses, the, convoys, would, stop, at, a, nearby, transit, camp, where, the, escorts, would, demand, a, ransom, from, the, armenians, those, unable, to, pay, were, murdered, units, of, the, special, organization, often, wearing, gendarme, uniforms, were, stationed, at, the, killing, sites, escorting, gendarmes, often, did, not, participate, in, killing, at, least, 150, 000, armenians, passed, through, erzindjan, from, june, 1915, where, a, series, of, transit, camps, were, set, up, to, control, the, flow, of, victims, to, the, killing, site, at, the, nearby, kemah, gorge, thousands, of, armenians, were, killed, near, lake, hazar, pushed, by, paramilitaries, off, the, cliffs, more, than, 500, 000, armenians, passed, through, the, firincilar, plain, south, of, malatya, one, of, the, deadliest, areas, during, the, genocide, arriving, convoys, having, passed, through, the, plain, to, approach, the, kahta, highlands, would, have, found, gorges, already, filled, with, corpses, from, previous, convoys, many, others, were, held, in, tributary, valleys, of, the, tigris, euphrates, or, murat, and, systematically, executed, by, the, special, organization, armenian, men, were, often, drowned, by, being, tied, together, back, to, back, before, being, thrown, in, the, water, a, method, that, was, not, used, on, women, authorities, viewed, disposal, of, bodies, through, rivers, as, a, cheap, and, efficient, method, but, it, caused, widespread, pollution, downstream, so, many, bodies, floated, down, the, tigris, and, euphrates, that, they, sometimes, blocked, the, rivers, and, needed, to, be, cleared, with, explosives, other, rotting, corpses, became, stuck, to, the, riverbanks, and, still, others, traveled, as, far, as, the, persian, gulf, the, rivers, remained, polluted, long, after, the, massacres, causing, epidemics, downstream, tens, of, thousands, of, armenians, died, along, the, roads, and, their, bodies, were, buried, hastily, or, more, often, simply, left, beside, the, roads, the, ottoman, government, ordered, the, corpses, to, be, cleared, as, soon, as, possible, to, prevent, both, photographic, documentation, and, disease, epidemics, but, these, orders, were, not, uniformly, followed, women, and, children, who, made, up, the, great, majority, of, deportees, were, usually, not, executed, immediately, but, subjected, to, hard, marches, through, mountainous, terrain, without, food, and, water, those, who, could, not, keep, up, were, left, to, die, or, shot, during, 1915, some, were, forced, to, walk, as, far, as, 1, 000, kilometers, 620, mi, in, the, summer, heat, some, deportees, from, western, anatolia, were, allowed, to, travel, by, rail, there, was, a, distinction, between, the, convoys, from, eastern, anatolia, which, were, eliminated, almost, in, their, entirety, and, those, from, farther, west, which, made, up, most, of, those, surviving, to, reach, syria, for, example, around, 99, percent, of, armenians, deported, from, erzerum, did, not, reach, their, destination, the, islamization, of, armenians, carried, out, as, a, systematic, state, policy, involving, the, bureaucracy, police, judiciary, and, clergy, was, a, major, structural, component, of, the, genocide, an, estimated, 100, 000, to, 200, 000, armenians, were, islamized, and, it, is, estimated, that, as, many, as, two, million, turkish, citizens, in, the, early, 21st, century, may, have, at, least, one, armenian, grandparent, some, armenians, were, allowed, to, convert, to, islam, and, evade, deportation, but, the, regime, insisted, on, their, destruction, wherever, their, numbers, exceeded, the, five, to, ten, percent, threshold, or, there, was, a, risk, of, them, being, able, to, preserve, their, nationality, and, culture, talaat, pasha, personally, authorized, conversion, of, armenians, and, carefully, tracked, the, loyalty, of, converted, armenians, until, the, end, of, the, war, although, the, first, and, most, important, step, was, conversion, to, islam, the, process, also, required, the, eradication, of, armenian, names, language, and, culture, and, for, women, immediate, marriage, to, a, muslim, although, islamization, was, the, most, feasible, opportunity, for, survival, it, also, transgressed, armenian, moral, and, social, norms, the, cup, allowed, armenian, women, to, marry, into, muslim, households, as, these, women, would, lose, their, armenian, identity, young, women, and, girls, were, often, appropriated, as, house, servants, or, sex, slaves, some, boys, were, abducted, to, work, as, forced, laborers, for, muslim, individuals, some, children, were, forcibly, seized, while, others, were, sold, or, given, up, by, their, parents, to, save, their, lives, special, state, run, orphanages, were, also, set, up, with, strict, procedures, intending, to, deprive, their, charges, of, an, armenian, identity, most, armenian, children, who, survived, the, genocide, endured, exploitation, hard, labor, without, pay, forced, conversion, to, islam, and, physical, and, sexual, abuse, armenian, women, captured, during, the, journey, ended, up, in, turkish, or, kurdish, households, those, who, were, islamized, during, the, second, phase, of, the, genocide, found, themselves, in, an, arab, or, bedouin, environment, the, rape, sexual, abuse, and, prostitution, of, armenian, women, were, all, very, common, although, armenian, women, tried, to, avoid, sexual, violence, suicide, was, often, the, only, alternative, deportees, were, displayed, naked, in, damascus, and, sold, as, sex, slaves, in, some, areas, constituting, an, important, source, of, income, for, accompanying, gendarmes, some, were, sold, in, arabian, slave, markets, to, muslim, hajj, pilgrims, and, ended, up, as, far, away, as, tunisia, or, algeria, a, secondary, motivation, for, genocide, was, the, destruction, of, the, armenian, bourgeoisie, to, make, room, for, a, turkish, and, muslim, middle, class, and, build, a, statist, national, economy, controlled, by, muslim, turks, the, campaign, to, turkify, the, economy, began, in, june, 1914, with, a, law, that, obliged, many, non, muslim, merchants, to, hire, muslims, following, the, deportations, the, businesses, of, the, victims, were, taken, over, by, muslims, who, were, often, incompetent, leading, to, economic, difficulties, the, genocide, had, catastrophic, effects, on, the, ottoman, economy, muslims, were, disadvantaged, by, the, deportation, of, skilled, professionals, and, entire, districts, fell, into, famine, following, their, farmers, deportation, the, ottoman, and, turkish, governments, passed, a, series, of, abandoned, properties, laws, to, manage, and, redistribute, property, confiscated, from, armenians, although, the, laws, maintained, that, the, state, was, simply, administering, the, properties, on, behalf, of, the, absent, armenians, there, was, no, provision, to, return, them, to, the, owners, it, was, presumed, that, they, had, ceased, to, exist, historians, taner, ak, am, and, mit, kurt, argue, that, the, republic, of, turkey, and, its, legal, system, were, built, in, a, sense, on, the, seizure, of, armenian, cultural, social, and, economic, wealth, and, on, the, removal, of, the, armenian, presence, the, proceeds, from, the, sale, of, confiscated, property, was, often, used, to, fund, the, deportation, of, armenians, and, resettlement, of, muslims, as, well, as, for, army, militia, and, other, government, spending, ultimately, this, formed, much, of, the, basis, of, the, industry, and, economy, of, the, post, 1923, republic, endowing, it, with, capital, the, dispossession, and, exile, of, armenian, competitors, enabled, many, lower, class, turks, i, e, peasantry, soldiers, and, laborers, to, rise, to, the, middle, class, confiscation, of, armenian, assets, continued, into, the, second, half, of, the, twentieth, century, and, in, 2006, the, national, security, council, ruled, that, property, records, from, 1915, must, be, kept, closed, to, protect, national, security, outside, istanbul, the, traces, of, armenian, existence, in, turkey, including, churches, and, monasteries, libraries, khachkars, and, animal, and, place, names, have, been, systematically, erased, beginning, during, the, war, and, continuing, for, decades, afterward, the, first, arrivals, in, mid, 1915, were, accommodated, in, aleppo, from, mid, november, the, convoys, were, denied, access, to, the, city, and, redirected, along, the, baghdad, railway, or, the, euphrates, towards, mosul, the, first, transit, camp, was, established, at, sibil, east, of, aleppo, one, convoy, would, arrive, each, day, while, another, would, depart, for, meskene, or, deir, ez, zor, dozens, of, concentration, camps, were, set, up, in, syria, and, upper, mesopotamia, by, october, 1915, some, 870, 000, deportees, had, reached, syria, and, upper, mesopotamia, most, were, repeatedly, transferred, between, camps, being, held, in, each, camp, for, a, few, weeks, until, there, were, very, few, survivors, this, strategy, physically, weakened, the, armenians, and, spread, disease, so, much, that, some, camps, were, shut, down, in, late, 1915, due, to, the, threat, of, disease, spreading, to, the, ottoman, military, in, late, 1915, the, camps, around, aleppo, were, liquidated, and, the, survivors, were, forced, to, march, to, ras, al, ayn, the, camps, around, ras, al, ayn, were, closed, in, early, 1916, and, the, survivors, sent, to, deir, ez, zor, in, general, armenians, were, denied, food, and, water, during, and, after, their, forced, march, to, the, syrian, desert, many, died, of, starvation, exhaustion, or, disease, especially, dysentery, typhus, and, pneumonia, some, local, officials, gave, armenians, food, others, took, bribes, to, provide, food, and, water, aid, organizations, were, officially, barred, from, providing, food, to, the, deportees, although, some, circumvented, these, prohibitions, survivors, testified, that, some, armenians, refused, aid, as, they, believed, it, would, only, prolong, their, suffering, the, guards, raped, female, prisoners, and, also, allowed, bedouins, to, raid, the, camps, at, night, for, looting, and, rape, some, women, were, forced, into, marriage, thousands, of, armenian, children, were, sold, to, childless, turks, arabs, and, jews, who, would, come, to, the, camps, to, buy, them, from, their, parents, in, the, western, levant, governed, by, the, ottoman, fourth, army, under, djemal, pasha, there, were, no, concentration, camps, or, large, scale, massacres, rather, armenians, were, resettled, and, recruited, to, work, for, the, war, effort, they, had, to, convert, to, islam, or, face, deportation, to, another, area, the, ability, of, the, armenians, to, adapt, and, survive, was, greater, than, the, perpetrators, expected, a, loosely, organized, armenian, led, resistance, network, based, in, aleppo, succeeded, in, helping, many, deportees, saving, armenian, lives, at, the, beginning, of, 1916, some, 500, 000, deportees, were, alive, in, syria, and, mesopotamia, afraid, that, surviving, armenians,

than, 200, 000, armenians, were, killed, between, march, and, october, 1916, often, in, remote, areas, near, deir, ez, zor, and, on, parts, of, the, khabur, valley, where, their, bodies, would, not, create, a, public, health, hazard, the, massacres, killed, most, of, the, armenians, who, had, survived, the, camp, system, the, ottoman, empire, tried, to, prevent, journalists, and, photographers, from, documenting, the, atrocities, threatening, them, with, arrest, nevertheless, substantiated, reports, of, mass, killings, were, widely, covered, in, western, newspapers, on, 24, may, 1915, the,
