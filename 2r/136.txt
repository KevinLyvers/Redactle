and, military, reform, and, political, consolidation, it, followed, the, spring, and, autumn, period, and, concluded, with, the, wars, of, conquest, that, saw, the, state, of, qin, annex, each, of, the, other, contender, states, by, 221, bc, and, found, the, qin, dynasty, the, first, imperial, dynastic, state, in, east, asian, history, while, scholars, have, identified, several, different, dates, as, marking, the, beginning, of, the, warring, states, period, sima, qian, s, choice, of, 475, bc, is, the, most, often, cited, the, era, largely, corresponds, to, the, second, half, of, the, eastern, zhou, period, where, the, king, of, zhou, formally, ruled, as, chinese, sovereign, but, had, lost, political, power, and, functioned, in, practice, as, a, figurehead, this, dynamic, served, as, the, backdrop, for, the, machinations, of, the, eponymous, warring, states, the, label, warring, states, period, derives, from, the, record, of, the, warring, states, a, work, of, history, compiled, during, the, early, han, dynasty, 202, bc, 220, ad, the, political, geography, of, the, era, was, dominated, by, the, seven, warring, states, namely, besides, these, seven, major, states, other, smaller, states, survived, into, the, period, they, include, the, eastward, flight, of, the, zhou, court, in, 771, bc, marks, the, start, of, the, spring, and, autumn, period, no, one, single, incident, or, starting, point, inaugurated, the, warring, states, era, the, political, situation, of, the, period, represented, a, culmination, of, historical, trends, of, conquest, and, annexation, which, also, characterised, the, spring, and, autumn, period, as, a, result, there, is, some, controversy, as, to, the, beginning, of, the, era, proposed, starting, points, include, the, eastern, zhou, dynasty, began, its, fall, around, 5th, century, bc, as, their, influence, waned, they, had, to, rely, on, other, armies, in, other, allied, states, rather, than, their, own, military, force, hundreds, of, smaller, polities, coalesced, into, seven, major, states, which, included, chu, han, qin, wei, yan, qi, and, zhao, however, there, eventually, was, a, shift, in, alliances, because, each, state, s, ruler, wanted, to, be, independent, in, power, this, caused, hundreds, of, wars, between, 535, and, 286, bc, the, victorious, state, would, have, overall, rule, and, control, in, china, the, system, of, feudal, states, created, by, the, western, zhou, dynasty, underwent, enormous, changes, after, 771, bc, with, the, flight, of, the, zhou, court, to, modern, day, luoyang, and, the, diminution, of, its, relevance, and, power, the, spring, and, autumn, period, led, to, a, few, states, gaining, power, at, the, expense, of, many, others, the, latter, no, longer, able, to, depend, on, central, authority, for, legitimacy, or, protection, during, the, warring, states, period, many, rulers, claimed, the, mandate, of, heaven, to, justify, their, conquest, of, other, states, and, spread, their, influence, the, struggle, for, hegemony, eventually, created, a, state, system, dominated, by, several, large, states, such, as, jin, chu, qin, yan, and, qi, while, the, smaller, states, of, the, central, plain, tended, to, be, their, satellites, and, tributaries, other, major, states, also, existed, such, as, wu, and, yue, in, the, southeast, the, last, decades, of, the, spring, and, autumn, era, were, marked, by, increased, stability, as, the, result, of, peace, negotiations, between, jin, and, chu, which, established, their, respective, spheres, of, influence, this, situation, ended, with, the, partition, of, jin, whereby, the, state, was, divided, between, the, houses, of, han, zhao, and, wei, and, thus, enabled, the, creation, of, the, seven, major, warring, states, the, rulers, of, jin, had, steadily, lost, political, powers, since, the, middle, of, the, 6th, century, bc, to, their, nominally, subordinate, nobles, and, military, commanders, a, situation, arising, from, the, traditions, of, the, jin, which, forbade, the, enfeoffment, of, relatives, of, the, ducal, house, this, allowed, other, clans, to, gain, fiefs, and, military, authority, and, decades, of, internecine, struggle, led, to, the, establishment, of, four, major, families, the, han, zhao, wei, and, zhi, the, battle, of, jinyang, saw, the, allied, han, zhao, and, wei, destroy, the, zhi, family, 453, bc, and, their, lands, were, distributed, among, them, with, this, they, became, the, de, facto, rulers, of, most, of, jin, s, territory, though, this, situation, would, not, be, officially, recognised, until, half, a, century, later, the, jin, division, created, a, political, vacuum, that, enabled, during, the, first, 50, years, expansion, of, chu, and, yue, northward, and, qi, southward, qin, increased, its, control, of, the, local, tribes, and, began, its, expansion, southwest, to, sichuan, in, 403, bc, the, court, of, king, weilie, of, zhou, officially, recognized, zhao, wei, and, han, as, immediate, vassals, thereby, raising, them, to, the, same, rank, as, the, other, warring, states, from, before, 405, until, 383, bc, the, three, jins, were,

siege, of, chu, however, wang, jian, decided, to, weaken, chu, s, resolve, and, tricked, the, chu, army, by, appearing, to, be, idle, in, his, fortifications, whilst, secretly, training, his, troops, to, fight, in, chu, territory, after, a, year, the, chu, defenders, decided, to, disband, due, to, apparent, lack, of, action, from, the, qin, wang, jian, invaded, at, that, point, with, full, force, and, overran, huaiyang, and, the, remaining, chu, forces, chu, lost, the, initiative, and, could, only, sustain, local, guerrilla, style, resistance, until, it, too, was, fully, conquered, with, the, destruction, of, shouchun, and, the, death, of, its, last, leader, lord, changping, in, 223, bc, at, their, peak, the, combined, armies, of, chu, and, qin, are, estimated, to, have, ranged, from, hundreds, of, thousands, to, a, million, soldiers, more, than, those, involved, in, the, campaign, of, changping, between, qin, and, zhao, 35, years, earlier, in, 222, bc, qin, conquered, zhao, and, yan, after, the, conquest, of, zhao, the, qin, army, turned, its, attention, towards, yan, realizing, the, danger, and, gravity, of, this, situation, crown, prince, dan, of, yan, had, sent, jing, ke, to, assassinate, king, zheng, of, qin, but, this, failure, only, helped, to, fuel, the, rage, and, determination, of, the, qin, king, and, he, increased, the, number, of, troops, to, conquer, the, yan, state, in, 221, bc, qin, conquered, qi, the, final, unconquered, state, it, had, not, previously, contributed, or, helped, other, states, when, qin, was, conquering, them, as, soon, as, qin, s, intention, to, invade, it, became, clear, qi, swiftly, surrendered, all, its, cities, completing, the, unification, of, china, and, ushering, in, the, qin, dynasty, the, last, qi, king, lived, out, his, days, in, exile, in, gong, and, was, not, given, a, posthumous, name, after, death, therefore, he, is, known, to, posterity, by, his, personal, name, jian, the, qin, king, ying, zheng, declared, himself, as, qin, shi, huangdi, the, first, sovereign, emperor, of, qin, in, the, rule, of, the, qin, state, the, union, was, based, solely, on, military, power, the, feudal, holdings, were, abolished, and, noble, families, were, forced, to, live, in, the, capital, city, xianyang, in, order, to, be, supervised, a, national, road, as, well, as, greater, use, of, canals, was, used, in, order, for, deployment, and, supply, of, the, army, to, be, done, with, ease, and, speed, the, peasants, were, given, a, wider, range, of, rights, in, regards, of, land, although, they, were, subject, to, taxation, creating, a, large, amount, of, revenue, to, the, state, the, chariot, remained, a, major, factor, in, chinese, warfare, long, after, it, went, out, of, fashion, in, the, middle, east, near, the, beginning, of, the, warring, states, period, there, is, a, shift, from, chariots, to, massed, infantry, possibly, associated, with, the, invention, of, the, crossbow, this, had, two, major, effects, first, it, led, the, dukes, to, weaken, their, chariot, riding, nobility, so, they, could, get, direct, access, to, the, peasantry, who, could, be, drafted, as, infantry, this, change, was, associated, with, the, shift, from, aristocratic, to, bureaucratic, government, second, it, led, to, a, massive, increase, in, the, scale, of, warfare, when, the, zhou, overthrew, the, shang, at, the, battle, of, muye, they, used, 45, 000, troops, and, 300, chariots, for, the, warring, states, period, the, following, figures, for, the, military, strengths, of, various, states, are, reported, for, major, battles, the, following, figures, are, reported, many, scholars, think, these, numbers, are, exaggerated, records, are, inadequate, they, are, much, larger, than, those, from, similar, societies, soldiers, were, paid, by, the, number, of, enemies, they, killed, and, the, han, dynasty, had, an, interest, in, exaggerating, the, bloodiness, of, the, age, before, china, was, unified, regardless, of, exaggeration, it, seems, clear, that, warfare, had, become, excessive, during, this, period, the, bloodshed, and, misery, of, the, warring, states, period, goes, a, long, way, in, explaining, china, s, traditional, and, current, preference, for, a, united, throne, the, warring, states, period, saw, the, introduction, of, many, innovations, to, the, art, of, warfare, in, china, such, as, the, use, of, iron, and, of, cavalry, warfare, in, the, warring, states, period, evolved, considerably, from, the, spring, and, autumn, period, as, most, armies, made, use, of, infantry, and, cavalry, in, battles, and, the, use, of, chariots, became, less, widespread, the, use, of, massed, infantry, made, warfare, bloodier, and, reduced, the, importance, of, the, aristocracy, which, in, turn, made, the, kings, more, despotic, from, this, period, onward, as, the, various, states, competed, with, each, other, by, mobilizing, their, armies, to, war, nobles, in, china, belonged, to, the, literate, class, rather, than, to, the, warrior, class, as, had, previously, been, the, case, the, various, states, fielded, massive, armies, of, infantry, cavalry, and, chariots, complex, logistical, systems, maintained, by, efficient, government, bureaucracies, were, needed, to, supply, train, and, control, such, large, forces, the, size, of, the, armies, ranged, from, tens, of, thousands, to, several, hundred, thousand, men, iron, weapons, became, more, widespread, and, began, to, replace, bronze, most, armour, and, weapons, of, this, period, were, made, from, iron, the, first, official, native, chinese, cavalry, unit, was, formed, in, 307, bc, during, the, military, reforms, of, king, wuling, of, zhao, who, advocated, nomadic, dress, and, horse, archery, but, the, war, chariot, still, retained, its, prestige, and, importance, despite, the, tactical, superiority, of, cavalry, the, crossbow, was, the, preferred, long, range, weapon, of, this, period, due, to, several, reasons, the, crossbow, could, be, mass, produced, easily, and, mass, training, of, crossbowmen, was, possible, these, qualities, made, it, a, powerful, weapon, against, the, enemy, infantrymen, deployed, a, variety, of, weapons, but, the, most, popular, was, the, dagger, axe, the, dagger, axe, came, in, various, lengths, from, 9, to, 18, feet, the, weapon, consisted, of, a, thrusting, spear, with, a, slashing, blade, appended, to, it, dagger, axes, were, an, extremely, popular, weapon, in, various, kingdoms, especially, for, the, qin, who, produced, 18, foot, long, pike, like, weapons, the, qiang, battle, spear, was, named, as, the, king, wang, of, all, ancient, weapons, it, had, the, biggest, impact, on, the, battlefield, and, was, quite, difficult, to, master, the, second, important, weapon, of, that, era, was, the, double, edged, battle, sword, jian, the, fighting, methods, of, using, the, qiang, spear, and, jian, sword, were, very, different, from, what, we, see, in, movies, or, re, enactment, shows, today, professional, warriors, of, that, era, used, the, military, concepts, of, master, sun, tzu, and, created, several, successful, ge, dou, martial, schools, the, warring, states, was, a, great, period, for, military, strategy, of, the, seven, military, classics, of, china, four, were, written, during, this, period, the, warring, states, period, was, an, era, of, warfare, in, ancient, china, as, well, as, bureaucratic, and, military, reforms, and, consolidation, the, major, states, ruling, over, large, territories, quickly, sought, to, consolidate, their, powers, leading, to, the, final, erosion, of, the, zhou, court, s, prestige, as, a, sign, of, this, shift, the, rulers, of, all, the, major, states, except, for, chu, which, had, claimed, kingly, title, much, earlier, abandoned, their, former, feudal, titles, for, the, title, of, or, king, claiming, equality, with, the, rulers, of, the, zhou, at, the, same, time, the, constant, conflict, and, need, for, innovative, social, and, political, models, led, to, the, development, of, many, philosophical, doctrines, later, known, as, the, hundred, schools, of, thought, the, most, notable, schools, of, thought, include, mohism, expounded, by, mozi, confucianism, represented, by, mencius, and, xunzi, legalism, represented, by, shang, yang, shen, buhai, shen, dao, and, han, fei, and, taoism, represented, by, zhuangzi, and, lao, tzu, the, many, states, that, were, competing, between, each, other, attempted, to, display, their, power, not, only, militarily, but, in, their, courts, and, in, state, philosophy, many, differing, rulers, adopted, the, differing, philosophies, to, their, own, advantage, or, that, of, their, kingdom, mencius, attempted, to, instate, confucianism, as, a, state, philosophy, proposing, that, through, the, governing, of, moral, principles, like, benevolence, and, righteousness, the, state, would, win, popular, support, from, one, state, and, those, neighboring, eliminating, the, need, of, a, war, altogether, mencius, had, attempted, to, convince, king, hui, of, liang, although, was, unsuccessful, since, the, king, saw, no, advantage, in, the, period, of, wars, mohism, was, developed, by, mozi, 468, 376, bc, and, it, provided, a, unified, moral, and, political, philosophy, based, on, impartiality, and, benevolence, mohists, had, the, belief, that, people, change, depending, on, environments, around, the, same, was, applied, to, rulers, which, is, why, one, must, be, cautious, of, foreign, influences, mozi, was, very, much, against, warfare, although, he, was, a, great, tactician, in, defense, he, defended, the, small, state, of, song, from, many, attempts, of, the, chu, state, taoism, was, advocated, by, laozi, and, believed, that, human, nature, was, good, and, can, achieve, perfection, by, returning, to, original, state, it, believed, that, like, a, baby, humans, are, simple, and, innocent, although, with, development, of, civilizations, it, lost, its, innocence, only, to, be, replaced, by, fraud, and, greed, contrarily, to, other, schools, it, did, not, want, to, gain, influence, in,

bureaucracies, and, centralized, governments, as, well, as, a, clear, legal, system, the, developments, in, political, and, military, organization, were, the, basis, of, the, power, of, the, qin, state, which, conquered, the, other, states, and, unified, them, under, the, qin, dynasty, in, 221, bc, the, phenomenon, of, intensive, warfare, based, on, mass, formations, of, infantry, rather, than, the, traditional, chariots, was, one, major, trend, which, led, to, the, creation, of, strong, central, bureaucracies, in, each, of, the, major, states, at, the, same, time, the, process, of, secondary, feudalism, which, permeated, the, spring, and, autumn, period, and, led, to, such, events, as, the, partition, of, jin, and, the, usurpation, of, qi, by, the, tian, clan, was, eventually, reversed, by, the, same, process, of, bureaucratisation, under, the, demands, of, warfare, the, states, adopted, bureaucratic, reforms, in, the, warring, states, period, wei, adopted, these, in, 445,
