the, history, of, north, africa, has, been, divided, into, its, prehistory, its, classical, period, the, arrival, and, spread, of, islam, the, colonial, period, and, finally, the, post, independence, era, in, which, the, current, nations, were, formed, the, region, has, been, influenced, by, many, diverse, cultures, the, development, of, sea, travel, firmly, brought, the, region, into, the, mediterranean, world, especially, during, the, classical, period, in, the, 1st, millennium, ad, the, sahara, became, an, equally, important, area, for, trade, as, camel, caravans, brought, goods, and, people, from, the, south, of, the, sahara, the, region, also, has, a, small, but, crucial, land, link, to, the, middle, east, and, that, area, has, also, played, a, key, role, in, the, history, of, north, africa, north, africa, is, a, relatively, thin, strip, of, land, between, the, sahara, desert, and, the, mediterranean, stretching, from, moroccan, atlantic, coast, to, egypt, the, region, has, no, set, definition, and, varies, from, source, to, source, generally, included, are, from, west, to, east, morocco, algeria, tunisia, libya, and, egypt, the, area, located, at, the, south, of, the, desert, is, a, steppe, a, semi, arid, region, called, the, sahel, it, is, the, ecoclimatic, and, biogeographic, zone, of, transition, in, africa, between, the, sahara, desert, to, the, north, and, the, sudanian, savanna, to, the, south, the, sudanian, savanna, is, a, broad, belt, of, tropical, savanna, that, spans, the, african, continent, from, the, atlantic, ocean, coast, in, the, west, sudanian, savanna, to, the, ethiopian, highlands, in, the, east, sudanian, savanna, in, 15, 000, bp, the, west, african, monsoon, transformed, the, landscape, of, africa, and, began, the, green, sahara, period, greater, rainfall, during, the, summer, season, resulted, in, the, growth, of, humid, conditions, e, g, lakes, wetlands, and, the, savanna, e, g, grassland, shrubland, in, north, africa, between, 5500, bp, and, 4000, bp, the, green, sahara, period, ended, the, earliest, known, humans, lived, in, north, africa, around, 260, 000, bc, through, most, of, the, stone, age, the, climate, in, the, region, was, very, different, from, today, the, sahara, being, far, more, moist, and, savanna, like, home, to, herds, of, large, mammals, this, area, could, support, a, large, hunter, gatherer, population, and, the, aterian, culture, that, developed, was, one, of, the, most, advanced, paleolithic, societies, in, the, mesolithic, period, capsian, culture, dominated, the, eastern, part, of, north, africa, with, neolithic, farmers, becoming, predominant, by, 6000, bc, over, this, period, the, sahara, region, was, steadily, drying, creating, a, barrier, between, north, africa, and, the, rest, of, africa, in, 10, 000, bp, engraved, and, painted, central, saharan, rock, art, began, to, be, created, spanning, the, bubaline, period, kel, essuf, period, round, head, period, pastoral, period, caballine, period, and, cameline, period, archaeological, evidence, has, attested, that, population, settlements, occurred, in, nubia, as, early, as, the, late, pleistocene, era, and, from, the, 5th, millennium, bc, onwards, whereas, there, is, no, or, scanty, evidence, of, human, presence, in, the, egyptian, nile, valley, during, these, periods, which, may, be, due, to, problems, in, site, preservation, the, nile, valley, on, the, eastern, edge, of, north, africa, is, one, of, the, richest, agricultural, areas, in, the, world, the, desiccation, of, the, sahara, is, believed, to, have, increased, the, population, density, in, the, nile, valley, and, large, cities, developed, eventually, ancient, egypt, unified, in, one, of, the, world, s, first, civilizations, the, expanse, of, the, libyan, desert, cut, egypt, off, from, the, rest, of, north, africa, egyptian, boats, while, well, suited, to, the, nile, were, not, usable, in, the, open, mediterranean, sea, moreover, the, egyptian, merchant, had, far, more, prosperous, destinations, on, crete, cyprus, and, the, levant, greeks, from, europe, and, the, phoenicians, from, asia, also, settled, along, the, coast, of, northern, africa, both, societies, drew, their, prosperity, from, the, sea, and, from, ocean, born, trade, they, found, only, limited, trading, opportunities, with, the, native, inhabitants, and, instead, turned, to, colonization, the, greek, trade, was, based, mainly, in, the, aegean, adriatic, black, and, red, seas, and, they, only, established, major, cities, in, cyrenaica, directly, to, the, south, of, greece, in, 332, bc, alexander, the, great, conquered, egypt, and, for, the, next, three, centuries, it, was, ruled, by, the, greek, ptolemaic, dynasty, the, phoenicians, developed, an, even, larger, presence, in, north, africa, with, colonies, from, tripoli, to, the, atlantic, one, of, the, most, important, phoenician, cities, was, carthage, which, grew, into, one, of, the, greatest, powers, in, the, region, at, the, height, of, its, power, carthage, controlled, the, western, mediterranean, and, most, of, north, africa, outside, of, egypt, however, rome, carthage, s, major, rival, to, the, north, defeated, it, in, a, series, of, wars, known, as, the, punic, wars, resulting, in, carthage, s, destruction, in, 146, bc, and, the, annexation, of, its, empire, by, the, romans, in, 30, bc, roman, emperor, octavian, conquered, egypt, officially, annexing, it, to, the, empire, and, for, the, first, time, unifying, the, north, african, coast, under, a, single, ruler, the, carthaginian, power, had, penetrated, deep, into, the, sahara, ensuring, the, quiescence, of, the, nomadic, tribes, in, the, region, the, roman, empire, was, more, confined, to, the, coast, yet, routinely, expropriated, berber, land, for, roman, farmers, they, thus, faced, a, constant, threat, from, the, south, a, network, of, forts, and, walls, were, established, on, the, southern, frontier, eventually, securing, the, region, well, enough, for, local, garrisons, to, control, it, without, broader, imperial, support, when, the, roman, empire, began, to, collapse, north, africa, was, spared, much, of, the, disruption, until, the, vandal, invasion, of, 429, ad, the, vandals, ruled, in, north, africa, until, the, territories, were, regained, by, justinian, of, the, eastern, empire, in, the, 6th, century, egypt, was, never, invaded, by, the, vandals, because, there, was, a, thousand, mile, buffer, of, desert, and, because, the, eastern, roman, empire, was, better, defended, during, the, rule, of, the, romans, vandals, byzantines, carthaginians, and, the, ottomans, the, kabyle, people, managed, to, maintain, their, independence, still, after, the, arab, conquest, of, north, africa, the, kabyle, people, maintained, the, possession, of, their, mountains, in, the, 7th, century, ce, the, inception, of, islam, facilitated, the, unification, of, nomadic, arab, tribes, by, bond, of, a, common, faith, preventing, their, historical, internecine, fighting, along, religious, divisions, 47, 48, the, main, motivation, for, expansion, was, to, spread, islam, and, convert, pagans, with, emphasis, on, the, toleration, of, people, practising, other, monotheistic, or, abrahamic, religions, 56, led, by, ingenious, generals, the, nascent, rashidun, caliphate, centred, in, medina, won, a, series, of, crucial, victories, against, the, established, powers, in, the, middle, east, expanding, in, all, directions, with, the, byzantine, s, financial, and, military, exhaustion, from, previous, wars, in, the, region, inducing, them, to, evacuate, from, syria, in, 636, ce, after, only, two, years, of, conflict, 47, 48, with, the, regional, byzantine, presence, and, power, shattered, the, muslim, armies, turned, towards, egypt, and, by, 642, ce, had, conquered, all, of, egypt, following, the, siege, of, alexandria, generally, facing, little, resistance, by, subjects, odious, of, roman, rule, 48, the, subsequent, rapid, islamization, of, egypt, has, been, attributed, to, people, s, dismay, at, the, disruption, caused, by, the, chalcedonian, schism, 59, marching, up, the, nile, the, muslims, launched, a, campaign, against, the, makurians, but, were, repelled, in, battle, in, a, rare, defeat, owing, to, skilled, nubian, archery, and, natural, defences, their, attention, would, then, turn, west, to, the, maghreb, where, the, exarchate, of, africa, had, declared, independence, from, constantinople, under, gregory, the, patrician, the, muslims, effortlessly, annexed, ifriqiya, modern, day, libya, and, in, 647, ce, defeated, and, killed, gregory, and, his, army, decisively, in, battle, not, wishing, to, annex, the, territory, they, carried, out, raids, across, the, decapitated, state, and, the, populations, seeing, they, were, at, the, muslims, mercy, appealed, to, the, general, to, pay, a, substantial, tribute, which, was, accepted, 232, the, rashidun, armies, returned, to, egypt, and, would, again, invade, makuria, in, 652, ce, only, to, again, be, repelled, in, battle, leading, them, both, to, sign, a, treaty, stipulating, peace, which, would, dictate, the, relations, between, egypt, and, nubia, for, over, seven, centuries, 81, 82, further, expansion, into, north, africa, waited, another, twenty, years, due, to, the, first, fitna, which, led, to, the, establishment, of, the, umayyad, caliphate, who, moved, the, capital, of, the, muslim, empire, to, damascus, and, its, rule, over, the, newly, conquered, territories, in, 670, ce, uqba, ibn, nafi, al, fihiri, invaded, what, is, now, tunisia, in, an, attempt, to, take, the, region, from, the, byzantine, empire, but, was, only, partially, successful, he, founded, the, town, of, kairouan, but, was, replaced, by, abul, muhajir, dinar, in, 674, ce, abul, muhajir, successfully, advanced, into, what, is, now, eastern, algeria, incorporating, the, kingdom, of, altava, and, awraba, tribe, both, ruled, by, kusaila, into, the, islamic, sphere, of, influence, 29, 30, in, 681, ce, uqba, was, given, command, of, the, arab, forces, again, and, advanced, westward, again, in, 682, ce, holding, kusaya, as, a, hostage, he, advanced, to, the, atlantic, ocean, in, the, west, and, penetrated, the, draa, river, valley, and, the, sus, region, in, what, is, now, morocco, however, kusaila, escaped, during, the, campaign, and, attacked, uqba, on, his, return, and, killed, him, near, biskra, in, what, is, now, algeria, after, uqba, s, death, the, arab, armies, retreated, from, kairouan, which, kusaila, took, as, his, capital, he, ruled, there, until, he, was, defeated, by, an, arab, army, under, zuhair, ibn, kays, this, caused, an, epiphany, among, the, berber, that, this, conflict, was, not, just, against, the, byzantine, s, 236, zuhair, himself, was, killed, in, 688, ce, while, fighting, against, the, byzantine, empire, which, had, reoccupied, cyrenaica, while, he, was, busy, in, tunisia, 30, in, 693, ce, caliph, abd, al, malik, ibn, marwan, sent, an, army, of, 40, 000, men, commanded, by, hasan, ibn, al, nu, man, into, cyrenaica, and, tripolitania, to, remove, the, byzantine, threat, to, the, umayyads, advance, in, north, africa, they, met, no, resistance, until, they, reached, tunisia, where, they, captured, carthage, and, defeated, the, byzantines, and, berbers, around, bizerte, 30, 31, soon, afterwards, al, nu, man, s, forces, came, into, conflict, with, the, kingdom, of, the, aures, and, jr, wa, tribe, both, under, the, leadership, of, their, queen, al, kahina, the, berbers, defeated, al, nu, man, in, two, engagements, the, first, on, the, river, nini, and, the, second, near, gabis, upon, which, al, nu, man, s, forces, retreated, to, cyrenaica, to, wait, for, reinforcements, for, five, years, this, secured, for, kahina, the, position, of, the, uncontested, ruler, of, the, maghreb, until, arab, reinforcements, arrived, in, 703, ce, and, al, nu, man, advanced, into, what, is, now, tunisia, again, meeting, al, kahina, near, gabis, this, time, he, was, successful, and, al, kahina, retreated, to, tubna, where, her, forces, were, defeated, and, she, was, killed, 31, al, nu, man, next, recaptured, carthage, from, the, byzantines, who, had, retaken, it, when, he, retreated, from, tunisia, he, founded, the, city, of, tunis, nearby, and, used, it, as, the, base, for, the, ummayad, navy, in, the, mediterranean, sea, the, byzantines, were, forced, to, abandon, the, maghreb, and, retreat, to, the, islands, of, the, mediterranean, sea, however, in, 705, ce, he, was, replaced, by, musa, bin, nusair, a, prot, g, of, then, governor, of, egypt, abdul, aziz, ibn, marwan, nusair, attacked, what, is, now, morocco, captured, tangier, and, advanced, to, the, sus, river, and, the, tafilalt, oasis, in, a, three, year, campaign, 31, 32, the, umayyads, were, overthrown, in, the, east, by, the, abbasid, revolution, which, replaced, it, with, the, abbasid, caliphate, the, abbasids, imposed, their, authority, on, egypt, and, central, north, africa, as, far, west, as, ifriqiya, but, the, regions, further, west, of, here, remained, beyond, their, control, these, western, regions, were, ruled, by, the, local, berber, tribes, or, other, local, dynasties, often, adhering, to, either, sufri, or, ibadi, kharijism, 41, the, fatimid, caliphate, was, established, by, abu, abdallah, al, shi, i, with, the, help, kutama, berbers, from, little, kabylia, after, they, conquered, ifriqiya, from, the, aghlabids, in, 909, abdallah, al, mahdi, was, enthroned, as, the, first, fatimid, caliph, in, ifriqiya, they, went, on, to, extend, direct, control, or, suzerainty, over, egypt, varying, extents, of, the, maghreb, sicily, the, levant, and, the, hijaz, in, 969, the, fatimid, army, conquered, egypt, and, in, 973, the, fatimid, court, was, reinstalled, in, the, new, capital, of, cairo, while, government, of, the, maghreb, was, entrusted, to, the, zirids, after, a, long, period, of, decline, the, fatimid, caliphate, was, eventually, abolished, by, salah, ad, din, in, 1171, and, replaced, in, egypt, by, the, ayyubid, dynasty, the, zirid, dynasty, was, a, family, of, sanhaja, berbers, that, were, originally, from, the, kabyle, mountains, initially, on, behalf, of, the, fatimids, they, ruled, the, eastern, and, central, maghreb, but, encountered, more, resistance, to, the, west, from, local, zenata, factions, and, the, umayyads, of, cordoba, 67, 74, 75, sometime, between, 1041, and, 1051, they, renounced, the, suzerainty, of, the, fatimid, caliphs, in, cairo, the, fatimid, retaliation, came, in, the, form, of, the, invasions, of, the, banu, hilal, and, banu, sulaym, into, the, maghreb, 68, 70, the, hammadids, came, to, power, after, declaring, their, independence, from, the, zirids, in, 1015, 69, they, managed, to, conquer, land, in, all, of, the, maghreb, region, capturing, and, possessing, significant, territories, such, as, algiers, bougie, tripoli, sfax, susa, fez, ouargla, and, sijilmasa, south, of, tunisia, they, also, possessed, a, number, of, oasis, that, were, the, termini, of, trans, saharan, trade, routes, in, the, 11th, century, berbers, of, the, sahara, began, a, jihad, to, reform, islam, in, north, africa, to, impose, what, they, saw, as, a, more, rigorously, orthodox, maliki, version, of, islam, they, were, initially, inspired, by, the, teachings, of, ibn, yasin, and, nominally, recognized, the, suzerainty, of, the, abbasid, caliphs, 76, 80, this, movement, created, an, empire, which, at, its, greatest, extent, encompassed, al, andalus, southern, and, eastern, iberia, at, the, time, and, roughly, all, of, present, day, morocco, and, western, sahara, this, movement, seems, to, have, assisted, the, southern, penetration, of, africa, one, that, was, continued, by, later, groups, in, addition, the, almoravids, are, traditionally, believed, to, have, attacked, and, brought, about, the, destruction, of, the, west, african, ghana, empire, however, this, interpretation, has, been, questioned, conrad, and, fisher, 1982, argued, that, the, notion, of, any, almoravid, military, conquest, at, its, core, is, merely, perpetuated, folklore, derived, from, a, misinterpretation, or, naive, reliance, on, arabic, sources, while, dierke, lange, agrees, but, argues, that, this, doesn, t, preclude, almoravid, political, agitation, claiming, that, ghana, s, demise, owed, much, to, the, latter, the, almohads, were, another, religious, and, political, movement, that, arose, among, the, berbers, of, the, western, maghreb, during, the, 12th, century, they, promoted, a, new, fundamentalist, and, unorthodox, reformist, version, of, islam, which, recognized, ibn, tumart, as, a, messianic, figure, the, mahdi, 246, after, ibn, tumart, s, death, the, movement, s, political, leadership, passed, on, to, abd, al, mu, min, who, overthrew, the, almoravids, and, conquered, the, entire, maghreb, and, the, remaining, territories, of, al, andalus, their, empire, disintegrated, in, the, 13th, century, and, was, succeeded, by, three, major, states, in, north, africa, the, marinids, in, the, western, maghreb, the, zayyanids, in, the, central, maghreb, and, the, hafsids, in, the, eastern, maghreb, ifriqiya, the, hafsids, were, a, masmuda, berber, dynasty, ruling, ifriqiya, modern, tunisia, from, 1229, to, 1574, their, territories, stretched, from, east, of, modern, algeria, to, west, of, modern, libya, during, their, zenith, the, dynasty, was, named, after, muhammad, bin, abu, hafs, a, berber, from, the, masmuda, tribe, of, morocco, he, was, appointed, governor, of, ifriqiya, present, day, tunisia, by, muhammad, an, nasir, caliph, of, the, almohad, empire, between, 1198, and, 1213, the, banu, hafs, were, a, powerful, group, amongst, the, almohads, their, ancestor, was, omar, abu, hafs, al, hentati, a, member, of, the, council, of, ten, and, a, close, companion, of, ibn, tumart, his, original, name, was, fesga, oumzal, which, later, changed, to, abu, hafs, omar, ibn, yahya, al, hentati, also, known, as, omar, inti, since, it, was, a, tradition, of, ibn, tumart, to, rename, his, close, companions, once, they, had, adhered, to, his, religious, teachings, the, hafsids, as, governors, on, behalf, of, the, almohads, faced, constant, threats, from, banu, ghaniya, who, were, descendants, of, almoravid, princes, which, the, almohads, had, defeated, and, replaced, as, a, ruling, dynasty, hafsids, were, ifriqiya, governors, of, almohads, until, 1229, when, they, declared, independence, after, the, split, of, the, hafsids, from, the, almohads, under, abu, zakariya, 1229, 1249, abu, zakariya, organised, the, administration, in, ifriqiya, the, roman, province, of, africa, in, modern, maghreb, today, s, tunisia, eastern, algeria, and, western, libya, and, built, tunis, up, as, the, economic, and, cultural, centre, of, the, empire, at, the, same, time, many, muslims, from, al, andalus, fleeing, the, spanish, reconquista, of, castile, aragon, and, portugal, were, absorbed, he, also, conquered, tlemcen, in, 1242, and, took, abdalwadids, as, his, vassal, his, successor, muhammad, i, al, mustansir, 1249, 1277, took, the, title, of, caliph, in, the, 14th, century, the, empire, underwent, a, temporary, decline, although, the, hafsids, succeeded, for, a, time, in, subjugating, the, kingdom, of, tlemcen, of, the, abdalwadids, between, 1347, and, 1357, they, were, twice, conquered, by, the, merinids, of, morocco, the, abdalwadids, however, could, not, defeat, the, bedouin, ultimately, the, hafsids, were, able, to, regain, their, empire, during, the, same, period, plague, epidemics, caused, a, considerable, fall, in, population, further, weakening, the, empire, under, the, hafsids, commerce, with, christian, europe, grew, significantly, however, piracy, against, christian, shipping, grew, as, well, particularly, during, the, rule, of, abd, al, aziz, ii, 1394, 1434, the, profits, were, used, for, a, great, building, programme, and, to, support, art, and, culture, however, piracy, also, provoked, retaliation, from, aragon, and, venice, which, several, times, attacked, tunisian, coastal, cities, under, utman, 1435, 1488, the, hafsids, reached, their, zenith, as, the, caravan, trade, through, the, sahara, and, with, egypt, was, developed, as, well, as, sea, trade, with, venice, and, aragon, the, bedouins, and, the, cities, of, the, empire, became, largely, independent, leaving, the, hafsids, in, control, of, only, tunis, and, constantine, in, the, 16th, century, the, hafsids, became, increasingly, caught, up, in, the, power, struggle, between, spain, and, the, ottoman, empire, supported, corsairs, ottomans, conquered, tunis, in, 1534, and, held, one, year, due, to, ottoman,

conquered, tunis, in, 1574, and, the, hafsids, accepted, becoming, a, spanish, vassal, state, to, offset, the, ottoman, threat, muhammad, iv, the, last, caliph, of, the, hafsids, was, brought, to, constantinople, and, was, subsequently, executed, due, to, his, collaboration, with, spain, and, the, desire, of, the, ottoman, sultan, to, take, the, title, of, caliph, as, he, now, controlled,

1960s, and, into, the, 1970s, all, of, the, north, african, states, gained, independence, from, their, colonial, european, rulers, except, for, a, few, small, spanish, colonies, on, the, far, northern, tip, of, morocco, and, parts, of, the, sahara, region, which, went, from, spanish, to, moroccan, rule, in, modern, times, the, suez, canal, in, egypt, constructed, in, 1869, has, caused, a, great, deal, of, controversy, the, convention, of, constantinople, in, 1888, declared, the, canal, a, neutral, zone, under, the, protection, of, the, british, after, british, troops, had, moved, in, to, protect, it, in, 1882, under, the, anglo, egyptian, treaty, of, 1936, the, united, kingdom, insisted, on, retaining, control, over, the, canal, in, 1951, egypt, repudiated, the, treaty, and, by, 1954, great, britain, had, agreed, to, pull, out, after, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, withdrew, their, pledge, to, support, the, construction, of, the, aswan, dam, president, gamal,

until, april, 1957, after, it, had, been, cleaned, up, with, un, assistance, a, united, nations, force, unef, was, established, to, maintain, the, neutrality, of, the, canal, and, the, sinai,
