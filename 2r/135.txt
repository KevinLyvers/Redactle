archaeologists, use, theoretical, guidelines, derived, from, anthropology, ethnology, analogy, and, ethnohistory, to, the, concept, of, what, defines, a, state, level, society, this, is, different, from, the, concept, of, state, guk, or, sino, ko, walled, town, state, etc, in, the, discipline, of, korean, history, in, anthropological, archaeology, the, presence, of, urban, centres, especially,

of, geographical, areas, that, are, usually, larger, in, area, than, a, single, river, valley, etc, make, up, some, of, these, correlates, that, define, states, among, the, archaeology, sites, dating, to, the, three, kingdoms, of, korea, hundreds, of, cemeteries, with, thousands, of, burials, have, been, excavated, the, vast, majority, of, archaeological, evidence, of, the, three, kingdoms, period, of, korea, consists, of, burials, but, since, the, 1990s, there, has, been, a, great, increase, in, the, archaeological, excavations, of, ancient, industrial, production, sites, roads, palace, grounds, and, elite, precincts, ceremonial, sites, commoner, households, and, fortresses, due, to, the, boom, in, salvage, archaeology, in, south, korea, rhee, and, choi, hypothesize, that, a, mix, of, internal, developments, and, external, factors, lead, to, the, emergence, of, state, level, societies, in, korea, a, number, of, archaeologists, including, kang, demonstrate, the, role, of, frequent, warfare, in, the, development, of, peninsular, states, some, individual, correlates, of, complex, societies, are, found, in, the, chiefdoms, of, korea, that, date, back, to, c, 700, bc, the, best, evidence, from, the, archaeological, record, indicates, that, states, formed, between, 300, bc, and, 300, 400, ad, however, archaeologists, are, not, prepared, to, suggest, that, this, means, there, were, states, in, the, bc, era, the, correlates, of, state, level, societies, did, not, develop, as, a, package, but, rather, in, spurts, and, starts, and, at, various, points, in, time, it, was, some, time, between, 100, and, 400, ad, that, individual, correlates, of, state, societies, had, developed, to, a, sufficient, number, and, scale, that, state, level, societies, can, be, confidently, identified, using, archaeological, data, lee, sung, joo, analyzed, variability, in, many, of, the, elite, cemeteries, of, the, territories, of, silla, and, gaya, polities, and, found, that, as, late, as, the, 2nd, century, there, was, intra, cemetery, variation, in, the, distribution, of, prestige, grave, goods, but, there, was, an, absence, of, hierarchical, differences, on, a, regional, scale, between, cemeteries, near, the, end, of, the, 2nd, century, ad, interior, space, in, elite, burials, increased, in, size, and, wooden, chamber, burial, construction, techniques, were, increasingly, used, by, elites, in, the, 3rd, century, a, pattern, developed, in, which, single, elite, cemeteries, that, were, the, highest, in, status, compared, to, all, the, other, cemeteries, were, built, such, cemeteries, were, established, at, high, elevations, along, ridgelines, and, on, hilltops, furthermore, the, uppermost, elite, were, buried, in, large, scale, tombs, established, at, the, highest, point, of, a, given, cemetery, cemeteries, with, uppermost, elite, mounded, burials, such, as, okseong, ri, yangdong, ri, daeseong, dong, and, bokcheon, dong, display, this, pattern, lee, sung, joo, proposed, that, in, addition, to, the, development, of, regional, political, hierarchies, as, seen, through, analysis, of, burials, variation, in, types, of, pottery, production, gradually, disappeared, and, full, time, specialization, was, the, only, recognizable, kind, of, pottery, production, from, the, end, of, the, 4th, century, a, d, at, the, same, time, the, production, centers, for, pottery, became, highly, centralized, and, vessels, became, standardized, centralisation, and, elite, control, of, production, is, demonstrated, by, the, results, of, the, archaeological, excavations, at, songok, dong, and, mulcheon, ni, in, gyeongju, these, sites, are, part, of, what, was, an, interconnected, and, sprawling, ancient, industrial, complex, on, the, northeast, outskirts, of, the, silla, capital, songok, dong, and, mulcheon, ri, are, examples, of, the, large, scale, of, specialized, factory, style, productions, in, the, three, kingdoms, and, unified, silla, periods, the, site, was, excavated, in, the, late, 1990s, and, archaeologists, found, the, remains, of, many, production, features, such, as, pottery, kilns, roof, tile, kilns, charcoal, kilns, as, well, as, the, remains, of, buildings, and, workshops, associated, with, production, since, the, establishment, of, goguryeo, its, early, history, is, well, attested, archaeologically, the, first, and, second, capital, cities, jolbon, and, gungnae, city, are, located, in, and, around, today, s, ji, an, jilin, in, 2004, the, site, was, designated, as, a, world, heritage, site, by, unesco, since, 1976, continuing, archaeological, excavations, concentrated, in, the, southeastern, part, of, modern, gyeongju, have, revealed, parts, of, the, so, called, silla, wanggyeong, silla, royal, capital, a, number, of, excavations, over, the, years, have, revealed, temples, such, as, hwangnyongsa, bunhwangsa, heungryunsa, and, 30, other, sites, signs, of, baekje, s, capitals, have, also, been, excavated, at, the, mongchon, fortress, and, the, pungnap, fortress, in, seoul
