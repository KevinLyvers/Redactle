the, history, of, the, mediterranean, region, and, of, the, cultures, and, people, of, the, mediterranean, basin, is, important, for, understanding, the, origin, and, development, of, the, mesopotamian, egyptian, canaanite, phoenician, hebrew, carthaginian, minoan, greek, persian, illyrian, thracian, etruscan, iberian, roman, byzantine, bulgarian, arab, berber, ottoman, christian, and, islamic, cultures, the, mediterranean, sea, was, the, central, superhighway, of, transport, trade, and, cultural, exchange, between, diverse, peoples, encompassing, three, continents, western, asia, north, africa, and, southern, europe, l, zignan, la, c, be, in, france, orce, in, spain, monte, poggiolo, in, italy, and, kozarnika, in, bulgaria, are, amongst, the, oldest, paleolithic, sites, in, europe, and, are, located, around, the, mediterranean, basin, there, is, evidence, of, stone, tools, on, crete, in, 130, 000, years, bc, which, indicates, that, early, humans, were, capable, of, using, boats, to, reach, the, island, the, cultural, stage, of, civilization, organised, society, structured, around, urban, centers, first, arises, in, southwest, asia, as, an, extension, of, the, neolithic, trend, from, as, early, as, the, 8th, millennium, bc, of, proto, urban, centers, such, as, atalh, y, k, urban, civilizations, proper, begin, to, emerge, in, the, chalcolithic, in, 5th, to, 4th, millennium, egypt, and, in, mesopotamia, the, black, sea, area, is, a, cradle, of, the, european, civilization, the, site, of, solnitsata, 5500, bc, 4200, bc, is, believed, to, be, the, oldest, town, in, europe, prehistoric, fortified, walled, stone, settlement, prehistoric, city, the, first, gold, artifacts, in, the, world, appear, from, the, 5th, millennium, bc, such, as, those, found, in, a, burial, site, from, 4569, 4340, bc, and, one, of, the, most, important, archaeological, sites, in, world, prehistory, the, varna, necropolis, near, lake, varna, in, bulgaria, thought, to, be, the, earliest, well, dated, find, of, gold, artifacts, as, of, 1990, gold, artifacts, found, at, the, wadi, qana, cave, cemetery, of, the, 4th, millennium, bc, in, the, west, bank, were, the, earliest, from, the, levant, the, bronze, age, arises, in, this, region, during, the, final, centuries, of, the, 4th, millennium, bc, the, urban, civilizations, of, the, fertile, crescent, now, have, writing, systems, and, develop, bureaucracy, by, the, mid, 3rd, millennium, leading, to, the, development, of, the, earliest, empires, in, the, 2nd, millennium, the, eastern, coastlines, of, the, mediterranean, are, dominated, by, the, hittite, and, egyptian, empires, competing, for, control, over, the, city, states, in, the, levant, canaan, the, minoans, are, trading, throughout, much, of, the, mediterranean, the, bronze, age, collapse, is, the, transition, from, the, late, bronze, age, to, the, early, iron, age, expressed, by, the, collapse, of, palace, economies, of, the, aegean, and, anatolia, which, were, replaced, after, a, hiatus, by, the, isolated, village, cultures, of, the, ancient, near, east, some, have, gone, so, far, as, to, call, the, catalyst, that, ended, the, bronze, age, a, catastrophe, the, bronze, age, collapse, may, be, seen, in, the, context, of, a, technological, history, that, saw, the, slow, comparatively, continuous, spread, of, iron, working, technology, in, the, region, beginning, with, precocious, iron, working, in, what, is, now, romania, in, the, 13th, and, 12th, centuries, the, cultural, collapse, of, the, mycenaean, kingdoms, the, hittite, empire, in, anatolia, and, syria, and, the, egyptian, empire, in, syria, and, israel, the, scission, of, long, distance, trade, contacts, and, sudden, eclipse, of, literacy, occurred, between, 1206, and, 1150, bc, in, the, first, phase, of, this, period, almost, every, city, between, troy, and, gaza, was, violently, destroyed, and, often, left, unoccupied, thereafter, for, example, hattusas, mycenae, ugarit, the, gradual, end, of, the, dark, age, that, ensued, saw, the, rise, of, settled, neo, hittite, aramaean, kingdoms, of, the, mid, 10th, century, bc, and, the, rise, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, while, the, cultural, advances, during, the, bronze, age, had, mostly, been, confined, to, the, eastern, parts, of, the, mediterranean, with, the, iron, age, the, entire, coastal, region, surrounding, the, mediterranean, now, becomes, involved, significantly, due, to, the, phoenician, expansion, from, the, levant, beginning, in, ca, the, 12th, century, fernand, braudel, remarked, in, the, perspective, of, the, world, that, phoenicia, was, an, early, example, of, a, world, economy, surrounded, by, empires, the, high, point, of, phoenician, culture, and, sea, power, is, usually, placed, ca, 1200, 800, bc, many, of, the, most, important, phoenician, settlements, had, been, established, long, before, this, byblos, tyre, sidon, simyra, arwad, and, berytus, all, appear, in, the, amarna, tablets, the, phoenicians, and, the, assyrians, transported, elements, of, the, late, bronze, age, culture, of, the, near, east, to, iron, age, greece, and, italy, but, also, further, afield, to, northwestern, africa, and, to, iberia, initiating, the, beginning, of, mediterranean, history, now, known, as, classical, antiquity, they, notably, spread, alphabetic, writing, which, would, become, the, hallmark, of, the, mediterranean, civilizations, of, the, iron, age, in, contrast, to, the, cuneiform, writing, of, assyria, and, the, logographic, system, in, the, far, east, and, later, the, abugida, systems, of, india, two, of, the, most, notable, mediterranean, civilizations, in, classical, antiquity, were, the, greek, city, states, and, the, phoenicians, the, greeks, spread, to, the, shores, of, the, black, sea, southern, italy, the, so, called, magna, graecia, and, asia, minor, the, phoenicians, spread, through, the, western, mediterranean, reaching, north, africa, and, the, iberian, peninsula, from, the, 6th, century, bc, up, to, including, the, 5th, century, bc, many, of, the, significant, mediterranean, peoples, were, under, persian, rule, making, them, dominate, the, mediterranean, during, these, years, both, the, phoenicians, and, some, of, the, greek, city, states, in, asia, minor, provided, the, naval, forces, of, the, achaemenid,

persian, fleet, even, by, then, no, true, imperial, navy, had, existed, either, in, greece, or, egypt, persia, would, become, the, first, empire, under, darius, to, inaugurate, and, deploy, the, first, regular, imperial, navy, both, the, phoenicians, and, the, greeks, provided, the, bulk, of, the, naval, forces, of, the, achaemenid, persian, empire, alongside, the, cypriots, and, egyptians, full, persian, dominance, in, the, mediterranean, ended, after, the, greco, persian, war, in, the, 5th, century, bc, and, persia, eventually, lost, all, her, influence, in, the, mediterranean, in, the, late, 4th, century, bc, following, alexander, s, conquests, in, the, northernmost, part, of, ancient, greece, in, the, ancient, kingdom, of, macedonia, technological, and, organizational, skills, were, forged, with, a, long, history, of, cavalry, warfare, the, hetairoi, companion, cavalry, was, considered, the, strongest, of, their, time, under, alexander, the, great, this, force, turned, east, and, in, a, series, of, decisive, battles, it, routed, the, persian, forces, and, took, over, as, the, dominant, empire, of, the, mediterranean, their, macedonia, empire, included, present, day, greece, bulgaria, egypt, the, phoenician, lands, and, many, other, basin, regions, of, the, mediterranean, and, asia, minor, the, major, centres, of, the, mediterranean, at, the, time, became, part, of, alexander, s, empire, as, a, result, his, empire, quickly, disintegrated, and, the, middle, east, egypt, and, greece, were, soon, again, independent, alexander, s, conquests, spread, greek, knowledge, and, ideas, throughout, the, region, these, eastern, powers, soon, began, to, be, overshadowed, by, those, farther, west, in, north, africa, the, former, phoenician, colony, of, carthage, rose, to, dominate, its, surroundings, with, an, empire, that, contained, many, of, the, former, phoenician, holdings, however, it, was, a, city, on, the, italian, peninsula, rome, that, would, eventually, dominate, the, entire, mediterranean, basin, spreading, first, through, italy, rome, defeated, carthage, in, the, punic, wars, despite, hannibal, s, famous, efforts, against, rome, in, the, second, punic, war, after, the, third, punic, war, rome, then, became, the, leading, force, in, the, mediterranean, region, the, romans, soon, spread, east, taking, greece, and, spreading, latin, knowledge, and, ideas, throughout, the, place, by, this, point, the, coastal, trading, cultures, were, thoroughly, dominant, over, the, inland, river, valleys, that, had, once, been, the, heart, of, the, great, powers, egyptian, power, moved, from, the, nile, cities, to, the, coastal, ones, especially, alexandria, mesopotamia, became, a, fringe, border, region, between, the, roman, empire, and, the, persians, when, augustus, founded, the, roman, empire, the, mediterranean, sea, began, to, be, called, mare, nostrum, latin, our, sea, by, the, romans, their, empire, was, centered, on, this, sea, and, all, the, area, was, full, of, commerce, and, naval, development, for, the, first, time, in, history, an, entire, sea, the, mediterranean, was, free, of, piracy, for, several, centuries, the, mediterranean, was, a, roman, lake, surrounded, on, all, sides, by, the, empire, the, empire, began, to, crumble, however, in, the, fifth, century, and, rome, collapsed, after, 476, ad, the, eastern, roman, or, byzantine, empire, began, its, domination, of, the, levant, during, its, wars, with, neighbouring, sassanid, persia, the, rule, through, the, 6th, century, ad, saw, climatic, instability, causing, inconsistent, production, distribution, and, a, general, economic, decline, the, sasanians, gained, territory, on, mediterranean, land, regularly, but, the, eastern, romans, remained, superior, in, the, mediterranean, sea, for, centuries, in, the, first, quarter, of, the, 7th, century, ce, the, sasanians, took, swaths, of, the, mediterranean, region, from, the, eastern, romans, during, the, byzantine, sasanian, war, of, 602, 628, though, the, sasanians, lost, territories, by, the, end, of, the, war, ultimately, byzantine, domination, in, the, region, was, forever, finished, by, invasions, of, the, arabs, and, later, the, turks, another, power, was, rising, in, the, east, that, of, islam, whilst, the, eastern, roman, empire, and, sassanid, persian, empires, were, both, weakened, by, centuries, of, stalemate, warfare, during, the, roman, persian, wars, in, a, series, of, rapid, muslim, conquests, the, arab, armies, motivated, by, islam, and, led, by, the, caliphs, and, skilled, military, commanders, such, as, khalid, ibn, al, walid, swept, through, most, of, the, middle, east, reducing, byzantine, lands, by, more, than, half, and, completely, engulfing, the, persian, lands, the, arab, invasions, disrupted, the, trade, relations, between, western, and, eastern, europe, while, cutting, the, trade, route, with, oriental, lands, this, however, had, the, indirect, effect, of, promoting, the, trade, across, the, caspian, sea, the, export, of, grains, from, egypt, was, re, routed, towards, the, eastern, world, oriental, goods, like, silk, and, spices, were, carried, from, egypt, to, ports, like, venice, and, constantinople, by, sailors, and, jewish, merchants, the, viking, raids, further, disrupted, the, trade, in, western, europe, and, brought, it, to, a, halt, however, the, norsemen, developed, the, trade, from, norway, to, the, white, sea, while, also, trading, in, luxury, goods, from, spain, and, the, mediterranean, the, byzantines, in, the, mid, 8th, century, retook, control, of, the, area, around, the, north, eastern, part, of, the, mediterranean, venetian, ships, from, the, 9th, century, armed, themselves, to, counter, the, harassment, by, arabs, while, concentrating, trade, of, oriental, goods, at, venice, the, powerful, and, long, lived, bulgarian, empire, was, the, main, european, rival, in, the, region, of, the, mediterranean, balkan, peninsula, between, the, 7th, and, the, 14th, centuries, creating, an, important, cultural, political, linguistic, and, religious, legacy, during, the, middle, ages, in, anatolia, the, muslim, expansion, was, blocked, by, the, still, capable, byzantines, with, the, help, of, the, tervel, of, bulgaria, the, byzantine, provinces, of, roman, syria, north, africa, and, sicily, however, could, not, mount, such, a, resistance, and, the, muslim, conquerors, swept, through, those, regions, at, the, far, west, they, crossed, the, sea, taking, visigothic, hispania, before, being, halted, in, southern, france, by, the, franks, at, its, greatest, extent, the, arab, empire, controlled, three, quarters, of, the, mediterranean, coast, and, fostered, an, economic, interrelationship, between, the, indian, ocean, and, mediterranean, much, of, north, africa, became, a, peripheral, area, to, the, main, muslim, centers, in, the, middle, east, but, al, andalus, and, morocco, soon, broke, from, this, distant, control, and, became, highly, advanced, societies, in, their, own, right, between, 831, and, 1071, the, emirate, of, sicily, was, one, of, the, major, centres, of, islamic, culture, in, the, mediterranean, after, its, conquest, by, the, christian, normans, the, island, developed, its, own, distinct, culture, with, the, fusion, of, latin, and, byzantine, influences, palermo, remained, a, leading, artistic, and, commercial, centre, of, the, mediterranean, well, into, the, middle, ages, the, fatimids, maintained, trade, relations, with, the, italian, city, states, like, amalfi, and, genoa, before, the, crusades, according, to, the, cairo, geniza, documents, a, document, dated, 996, mentions, amalfian, merchants, living, in, cairo, another, letter, states, that, the, genoese, had, traded, with, alexandria, the, caliph, al, mustansir, had, allowed, amalfian, merchants, to, reside, in, jerusalem, about, 1060, in, place, of, the, latin, hospice, more, organized, and, centralized, states, gradually, began, to, form, in, europe, during, the, later, middle, ages, motivated, by, religion, and, dreams, of, conquest, the, kings, of, europe, launched, a, number, of, crusades, to, try, to, roll, back, muslim, power, and, retake, the, holy, land, the, crusades, were, unsuccessful, in, this, goal, but, they, were, far, more, effective, in, weakening, the, already, tottering, byzantine, empire, that, began, to, lose, increasing, amounts, of, territory, to, the, seljuk, turks, and, later, to, the, ottoman, turks, they, also, rearranged, the, balance, of, power, in, the, muslim, world, as, egypt, once, again, emerged, as, a, major, power, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, the, crusades, led, to, flourishing, of, trade, between, europe, and, the, outremer, region, genoa, venice, and, pisa, created, colonies, in, regions, controlled, by, the, crusaders, and, came, to, control, the, trade, with, the, orient, these, colonies, also, allowed, them, to, trade, with, the, eastern, world, though, the, fall, of, the, crusader, states, and, attempts, at, banning, of, trade, relations, with, muslim, states, by, the, popes, temporarily, disrupted, the, trade, with, the, orient, it, however, continued, the, zirid, state, in, eastern, maghreb, developed, around, the, great, metropolis, of, kairouan, collapsed, in, mid, 12th, century, with, a, henceforth, fragmented, ifriqiya, becoming, a, ground, for, competing, external, powers, from, then, on, the, high, middle, ages, also, saw, the, successive, rise, of, two, berber, powers, the, almoravids, and, the, almohads, in, the, western, maghreb, fostering, the, developments, of, cities, such, as, marrakech, and, fez, upon, their, control, over, trans, saharan, trade, cities, in, southern, iberia, such, as, almer, a, under, almoravid, rule, also, thrived, in, the, high, middle, ages, the, 12th, century, also, saw, increasing, naval, and, trading, progress, on, the, part, of, christian, powers, in, the, northern, shores, of, the, mediterranean, including, genoa, pisa, and, aragon, seemingly, offering, a, challenge, to, the, balance, of, power, in, the, western, mediterranean, slavery, was, a, strategic, and, very, important, part, of, all, mediterranean, societies, during, the, middle, ages, the, threat, of, becoming, a, slave, was, a, constant, fear, for, peasants, fishermen, and, merchants, those, with, money, or, who, had, financial, backing, only, feared, the, lack, of, support, should, they, be, threatened, with, abduction, for, ransom, there, were, several, things, which, could, happen, to, people, in, the, mediterranean, region, of, the, middle, ages, emperors, would, take, large, numbers, of, prisoners, parade, them, through, the, capital, hold, feasts, in, honour, of, their, capture, and, parade, diplomats, in, front, of, them, as, a, display, of, victory, the, repubbliche, marinare, maritime, republics, of, amalfi, gaeta, venice, genoa, ancona, pisa, and, ragusa, developed, their, own, empires, in, the, mediterranean, shores, the, islamic, states, had, never, been, major, naval, powers, and, trade, from, the, east, to, europe, was, soon, in, the, hands, of, italian, traders, especially, the, genoese, and, the, venetians, who, profited, immensely, from, it, the, republic, of, pisa, and, later, the, republic, of, ragusa, used, diplomacy, to, further, trade, and, maintained, a, libertarian, approach, in, civil, matters, to, further, sentiment, in, its, inhabitants, the, republic, of, venice, got, to, dominate, the, eastern, mediterranean, shores, after, the, fourth, crusade, between, 1275, and, 1344, a, struggle, for, the, control, of, the, strait, of, gibraltar, took, place, featuring, the, marinid, sultanate, the, nasrid, kingdom, of, granada, the, crown, of, castile, the, crown, of, arag, n, the, kingdom, of, portugal, and, the, republic, of, genoa, it, was, characterized, by, changing, alliances, between, the, main, actors, the, iberian, cities, of, tarifa, ceuta, algeciras, or, ronda, and, the, african, port, of, ceuta, were, at, stake, the, western, mediterranean, sea, was, dominated, by, the, crown, of, aragon, thanks, to, their, possessions, of, sicily, the, kingdom, of, naples, the, kingdom, of, sardinia, the, balearic, islands, the, duchy, of, athens, the, duchy, of, neopatria, and, several, northern, african, cities, in, 1347, the, black, death, spread, from, constantinople, across, the, mediterranean, basin, ottoman, power, continued, to, grow, and, in, 1453, the, byzantine, empire, was, extinguished, with, the, fall, of, constantinople, the, ottomans, already, controlled, greece, bulgaria, and, much, of, the, balkans, and, soon, also, began, to, spread, through, north, africa, north, africa, had, grown, wealthy, from, the, trade, across, the, sahara, desert, but, the, portuguese, who, along, with, other, christian, powers, had, been, engaged, in, a, long, campaign, to, evict, the, muslims, from, iberia, had, found, a, method, to, circumvent, this, trade, by, trading, directly, with, west, africa, this, was, enabled, by, a, new, type, of, ships, the, caravel, that, made, trade, in, the, rough, atlantic, waters, profitable, for, the, first, time, the, reduction, in, the, saharan, trade, weakened, north, africa, and, made, them, an, easy, target, for, the, ottomans, ceuta, was, ultimately, taken, by, the, kingdom, of, portugal, in, 1415, searching, to, undermine, castilian, aragonese, and, genoese, interests, in, the, area, during, the, middle, ages, rival, christian, and, muslim, kingdoms, forbade, the, trade, of, particular, goods, to, enemy, kingdoms, including, weaponry, and, other, contraband, items, the, popes, forbade, the, export, of, these, commodities, to, the, islamic, world, the, ottomans, too, forbade, the, export, of, weapons, and, other, strategic, items, declaring, them, memnu, e, ya, or, memnu, olan, to, christian, states, even, in, peace, treaties, however, friendly, states, could, import, some, of, the, prohibited, goods, through, capitulations, despite, these, prohibitions, trade, of, contraband, occurred, on, both, sides, the, european, merchants, traded, in, illegal, goods, with, muslims, the, ottomans, were, unable, to, suppress, the, trade, with, smuggling, being, undertaken, mainly, in, the, winter, when, the, ottoman, navy, stationed, at, the, istanbul, arsenal, was, unable, to, stop, ottoman, and, non, ottoman, vessels, from, indulging, in, the, trade, the, growing, naval, prowess, of, the, european, powers, confronted, further, rapid, ottoman, expansion, in, the, region, when, the, battle, of, lepanto, checked, the, power, of, the, ottoman, navy, however, as, braudel, argued, forcefully, this, only, slowed, the, ottoman, expansion, instead, of, ending, it, the, prized, island, of, cyprus, became, ottoman, in, 1571, the, last, resistance, in, tunisia, ended, in, 1574, and, almost, a, generation, long, siege, in, crete, pushed, venetians, out, of, this, strategic, island, in, 1669, a, balance, of, power, was, then, established, between, the, spanish, crown, and, the, ottoman, empire, until, the, 18th, century, each, dominating, their, respective, half, of, mediterranean, reducing, italian, navies, as, naval, powers, increasingly, more, irrelevant, furthermore, the, ottoman, empire, had, succeeded, in, their, objective, of, extending, muslim, rule, across, the, north, african, coast, the, development, of, long, range, seafaring, had, an, influence, upon, the, entire, mediterranean, while, once, all, trade, from, the, east, had, passed, through, the, region, the, circumnavigation, of, africa, allowed, gold, spices, and, dyes, to, be, imported, directly, to, the, atlantic, ports, of, western, europe, the, americas, were, also, a, source, of, extreme, wealth, to, the, western, powers, from, which, some, of, the, mediterranean, states, were, largely, cut, off, the, base, of, european, power, thus, shifted, northward, and, the, once, wealthy, italy, became, a, peripheral, area, dominated, by, foreigners, the, ottoman, empire, also, began, a, slow, decline, that, saw, its, north, african, possessions, gain, de, facto, independence, and, its, european, holdings, gradually, reduced, by, the, territorial, gains, of, austria, and, the, russian, empire, in, the, wake, of, the, aftermath, of, the, 1768, 1774, russo, turkish, war, the, russian, empire, gained, direct, access, to, the, black, sea, by, the, nineteenth, century, the, european, states, were, vastly, more, powerful, and, began, to, colonize, north, africa, france, spread, its, power, south, by, starting, their, conquest, of, the, regency, of, algiers, in, 1830, and, later, gaining, control, over, the, beylik, of, tunis, following, the, british, capture, of, gibraltar, 1713, malta, 1814, and, cyprus, 1878, the, british, empire, occupied, egypt, as, a, result, of, the, 1882, anglo, egyptian, war, the, suez, canal, was, opened, during, this, period, with, far, reaching, consequences, for, trade, between, asia, east, africa, and, europe, the, mediterranean, countries, were, preferred, because, of, the, shorter, route, and, port, cities, such, as, trieste, with, their, direct, fast, access, to, central, and, northern, europe, were, booming, italy, conquered, libya, from, the, ottomans, in, 1911, greece, achieved, independence, in, 1832, the, ottoman, empire, finally, collapsed, in, the, first, world, war, and, its, holdings, were, carved, up, among, france, and, britain, the, rump, state, of, the, wider, ottoman, empire, became, the, independent, state, of, turkey, in, 1923, yugoslavia, was, created, from, the, former, austro, hungarian,
