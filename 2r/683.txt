genealogy, from, ancient, greek, genealog, a, the, making, of, a, pedigree, is, the, study, of, families, family, history, and, the, tracing, of, their, lineages, genealogists, use, oral, interviews, historical, records, genetic, analysis, and, other, records, to, obtain, information, about, a, family, and, to, demonstrate, kinship, and, pedigrees, of, its, members, the, results, are, often, displayed, in, charts, or, written, as, narratives, the, field, of, family, history, is, broader, than, genealogy, and, covers, not, just, lineage, but, also, family, and, community, history, and, biography, the, record, of, genealogical, work, may, be, presented, as, a, genealogy, a, family, history, or, a, family, tree, in, the, narrow, sense, a, genealogy, or, a, family, tree, traces, the, descendants, of, one, person, whereas, a, family, history, traces, the, ancestors, of, one, person, but, the, terms, are, often, used, interchangeably, a, family, history, may, include, additional, biographical, information, family, traditions, and, the, like, the, pursuit, of, family, history, and, origins, tends, to, be, shaped, by, several, motives, including, the, desire, to, carve, out, a, place, for, one, s, family, in, the, larger, historical, picture, a, sense, of, responsibility, to, preserve, the, past, for, future, generations, and, self, satisfaction, in, accurate, storytelling, genealogy, research, is, also, performed, for, scholarly, or, forensic, purposes, or, to, trace, legal, next, of, kin, to, inherit, under, intestacy, laws, amateur, genealogists, typically, pursue, their, own, ancestry, and, that, of, their, spouses, professional, genealogists, may, also, conduct, research, for, others, publish, books, on, genealogical, methods, teach, or, produce, their, own, databases, they, may, work, for, companies, that, provide, software, or, produce, materials, of, use, to, other, professionals, and, to, amateurs, both, try, to, understand, not, just, where, and, when, people, lived, but, also, their, lifestyles, biographies, and, motivations, this, often, requires, or, leads, to, knowledge, of, antiquated, laws, old, political, boundaries, migration, trends, and, historical, socioeconomic, or, religious, conditions, genealogists, sometimes, specialize, in, a, particular, group, e, g, a, scottish, clan, a, particular, surname, such, as, in, a, one, name, study, a, small, community, e, g, a, single, village, or, parish, such, as, in, a, one, place, study, or, a, particular, often, famous, person, bloodlines, of, salem, is, an, example, of, a, specialized, family, history, group, it, welcomes, members, who, can, prove, descent, from, a, participant, of, the, salem, witch, trials, or, who, simply, choose, to, support, the, group, genealogists, and, family, historians, often, join, family, history, societies, where, novices, can, learn, from, more, experienced, researchers, such, societies, generally, serve, a, specific, geographical, area, their, members, may, also, index, records, to, make, them, more, accessible, or, engage, in, advocacy, and, other, efforts, to, preserve, public, records, and, cemeteries, some, schools, engage, students, in, such, projects, as, a, means, to, reinforce, lessons, regarding, immigration, and, history, other, benefits, include, family, medical, histories, for, families, with, serious, medical, conditions, that, are, hereditary, the, terms, genealogy, and, family, history, are, often, used, synonymously, but, some, entities, offer, a, slight, difference, in, definition, the, society, of, genealogists, while, also, using, the, terms, interchangeably, describes, genealogy, as, the, establishment, of, a, pedigree, by, extracting, evidence, from, valid, sources, of, how, one, generation, is, connected, to, the, next, and, family, history, as, a, biographical, study, of, a, genealogically, proven, family, and, of, the, community, and, country, in, which, they, lived, individuals, conduct, genealogical, research, for, a, number, of, reasons, private, individuals, research, genealogy, out, of, curiosity, about, their, heritage, this, curiosity, can, be, particularly, strong, among, those, whose, family, histories, were, lost, or, unknown, due, to, for, example, adoption, or, separation, from, family, through, divorce, death, or, other, situations, in, addition, to, simply, wanting, to, know, more, about, who, they, are, and, where, they, came, from, individuals, may, research, their, genealogy, to, learn, about, any, hereditary, diseases, in, their, family, history, there, is, a, growing, interest, in, family, history, in, the, media, as, a, result, of, advertising, and, television, shows, sponsored, by, large, genealogy, companies, such, as, ancestry, com, this, coupled, with, easier, access, to, online, records, and, the, affordability, of, dna, tests, has, both, inspired, curiosity, and, allowed, those, who, are, curious, to, easily, start, investigating, their, ancestry, in, communitarian, societies, one, s, identity, is, defined, as, much, by, one, s, kin, network, as, by, individual, achievement, and, the, question, who, are, you, would, be, answered, by, a, description, of, father, mother, and, tribe, new, zealand, m, ori, for, example, learn, whakapapa, genealogies, to, discover, who, they, are, family, history, plays, a, part, in, the, practice, of, some, religious, belief, systems, for, example, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, lds, church, has, a, doctrine, of, baptism, for, the, dead, which, necessitates, that, members, of, that, faith, engage, in, family, history, research, in, east, asian, countries, that, were, historically, shaped, by, confucianism, many, people, follow, a, practice, of, ancestor, worship, as, well, as, genealogical, record, keeping, ancestors, names, are, inscribed, on, tablets, and, placed, in, shrines, where, rituals, are, performed, genealogies, are, also, recorded, in, genealogy, books, this, practice, is, rooted, in, the, belief, that, respect, for, one, s, family, is, a, foundation, for, a, healthy, society, royal, families, both, historically, and, in, modern, times, keep, records, of, their, genealogies, in, order, to, establish, their, right, to, rule, and, determine, who, will, be, the, next, sovereign, for, centuries, in, various, cultures, one, s, genealogy, has, been, a, source, of, political, and, social, status, some, countries, and, indigenous, tribes, allow, individuals, to, obtain, citizenship, based, on, their, genealogy, in, ireland, and, in, greece, for, example, an, individual, can, become, a, citizen, if, one, of, their, grandparents, was, born, in, that, country, regardless, of, their, own, or, their, parents, birthplace, in, societies, such, as, australia, or, the, united, states, by, the, 20th, century, there, was, growing, pride, in, the, pioneers, and, nation, builders, establishing, descent, from, these, was, and, is, important, to, lineage, societies, such, as, the, daughters, of, the, american, revolution, and, the, general, society, of, mayflower, descendants, modern, family, history, explores, new, sources, of, status, such, as, celebrating, the, resilience, of, families, that, survived, generations, of, poverty, or, slavery, or, the, success, of, families, in, integrating, across, racial, or, national, boundaries, some, family, histories, even, emphasize, links, to, celebrity, criminals, such, as, the, bushranger, ned, kelly, in, australia, lawyers, involved, in, probate, cases, do, genealogy, to, locate, heirs, of, property, detectives, may, perform, genealogical, research, using, dna, evidence, to, identify, victims, of, homicides, or, perpetrators, of, crimes, historians, and, geneticists, may, carry, out, genealogical, research, to, gain, a, greater, understanding, of, specific, topics, in, their, respective, fields, and, some, may, employ, professional, genealogists, in, connection, with, specific, aspects, of, their, research, they, also, publish, their, research, in, peer, reviewed, journals, the, introduction, of, postgraduate, courses, in, genealogy, in, recent, years, has, given, genealogy, more, of, an, academic, focus, with, the, emergence, of, peer, reviewed, journals, in, this, area, scholarly, genealogy, is, beginning, to, emerge, as, a, discipline, in, its, own, right, with, an, increasing, number, of, individuals, who, have, obtained, genealogical, qualifications, carrying, out, research, on, a, diverse, range, of, topics, related, to, genealogy, both, within, academic, institutions, and, independently, in, the, us, the, one, drop, rule, asserted, that, any, person, with, even, one, ancestor, of, black, ancestry, one, drop, of, black, blood, was, considered, black, it, was, codified, into, the, law, of, some, states, e, g, the, racial, integrity, act, of, 1924, to, reinforce, racial, segregation, genealogy, was, also, used, in, nazi, germany, to, determine, whether, a, person, was, considered, a, jew, or, a, mischling, mischling, test, and, whether, a, person, was, considered, as, aryan, ahnenpass, hereditary, emperors, kings, and, chiefs, in, several, areas, have, long, claimed, descent, from, gods, thus, establishing, divine, legitimacy, court, genealogists, have, preserved, or, invented, appropriate, genealogical, pretensions, for, example, in, japan, polynesia, and, the, indo, european, world, from, scandinavia, through, ancient, greece, to, india, historically, in, western, societies, genealogy, focused, on, the, kinship, and, descent, of, rulers, and, nobles, often, arguing, or, demonstrating, the, legitimacy, of, claims, to, wealth, and, power, genealogy, often, overlapped, with, heraldry, which, reflected, the, ancestry, of, noble, houses, in, their, coats, of, arms, modern, scholars, regard, many, claimed, noble, ancestries, as, fabrications, such, as, the, anglo, saxon, chronicle, s, tracing, of, the, ancestry, of, several, english, kings, to, the, god, woden, with, the, coming, of, christianity, to, northern, europe, anglo, saxon, royal, genealogies, extended, the, kings, lines, of, ancestry, from, woden, back, to, reach, the, line, of, biblical, patriarchs, noah, and, adam, this, extension, offered, the, side, benefit, of, connecting, pretentious, rulers, with, the, prestigious, genealogy, of, jesus, modern, historians, and, genealogists, may, regard, manufactured, pseudo, genealogies, with, a, degree, of, scepticism, however, the, desire, to, find, ancestral, links, with, prominent, figures, from, a, legendary, or, distant, past, has, persisted, in, the, united, states, for, example, it, does, no, harm, to, establish, one, s, links, to, ancestors, who, boarded, the, mayflower, and, the, popularity, of, the, genealogical, hypothesis, of, the, holy, blood, and, the, holy, grail, 1982, demonstrates, popular, interest, in, ancient, bloodlines, however, dubious, some, family, trees, have, been, maintained, for, considerable, periods, the, family, tree, of, confucius, has, been, maintained, for, over, 2, 500, years, and, is, listed, in, the, guinness, book, of, world, records, as, the, largest, extant, family, tree, the, fifth, edition, of, the, confucius, genealogy, was, printed, in, 2009, by, the, confucius, genealogy, compilation, committee, cgcc, in, modern, times, genealogy, has, become, more, widespread, with, commoners, as, well, as, nobility, researching, and, maintaining, their, family, trees, genealogy, received, a, boost, in, the, late, 1970s, with, the, television, broadcast, of, roots, the, saga, of, an, american, family, by, alex, haley, his, account, of, his, family, s, descent, from, the, african, tribesman, kunta, kinte, inspired, many, others, to, study, their, own, lines, with, the, advent, of, the, internet, the, number, of, resources, readily, accessible, to, genealogists, has, vastly, increased, fostering, an, explosion, of, interest, in, the, topic, genealogy, on, the, internet, became, increasingly, popular, starting, in, the, early, 2000s, the, internet, has, become, a, major, source, not, only, of, data, for, genealogists, but, also, of, education, and, communication, some, notable, places, where, traditional, genealogy, records, are, kept, include, hindu, genealogy, registers, at, haridwar, uttarakhand, varanasi, and, allahabad, uttar, pradesh, kurukshetra, haryana, trimbakeshwar, maharashtra, and, chintpurni, himachal, pradesh, genealogical, research, in, the, united, states, was, first, systematized, in, the, early, 19th, century, especially, by, john, farmer, 1789, 1838, before, farmer, s, efforts, tracing, one, s, genealogy, was, seen, as, an, attempt, by, the, american, colonists, to, secure, a, measure, of, social, standing, an, aim, that, was, counter, to, the, new, republic, s, egalitarian, future, oriented, ideals, as, outlined, in, the, constitution, as, fourth, of, july, celebrations, commemorating, the, founding, fathers, and, the, heroes, of, the, revolutionary, war, became, increasingly, popular, however, the, pursuit, of, antiquarianism, which, focused, on, local, history, became, acceptable, as, a, way, to, honor, the, achievements, of, early, americans, farmer, capitalized, on, the, acceptability, of, antiquarianism, to, frame, genealogy, within, the, early, republic, s, ideological, framework, of, pride, in, one, s, american, ancestors, he, corresponded, with, other, antiquarians, in, new, england, where, antiquarianism, and, genealogy, were, well, established, and, became, a, coordinator, booster, and, contributor, to, the, growing, movement, in, the, 1820s, he, and, fellow, antiquarians, began, to, produce, genealogical, and, antiquarian, tracts, in, earnest, slowly, gaining, a, devoted, audience, among, the, american, people, though, farmer, died, in, 1838, his, efforts, led, to, the, founding, in, 1845, of, the, new, england, historic, genealogical, society, nehgs, one, of, new, england, s, oldest, and, most, prominent, organizations, dedicated, to, the, preservation, of, public, records, nehgs, publishes, the, new, england, historical, and, genealogical, register, the, genealogical, society, of, utah, founded, in, 1894, later, became, the, family, history, department, of, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, the, department, s, research, facility, the, family, history, library, which, utah, com, claims, as, the, largest, genealogical, library, in, the, world, was, established, to, assist, in, tracing, family, lineages, for, special, religious, ceremonies, which, latter, day, saints, believe, will, seal, family, units, together, for, eternity, latter, day, saints, believe, that, this, fulfilled, a, biblical, prophecy, stating, that, the, prophet, elijah, would, return, to, turn, the, heart, of, the, fathers, to, the, children, and, the, heart, of, the, children, to, their, fathers, there, is, a, network, of, church, operated, family, history, centers, all, over, the, united, states, and, around, the, world, where, volunteers, assist, the, public, with, tracing, their, ancestors, brigham, young, university, offers, bachelor, s, degree, minor, and, concentration, programs, in, family, history, and, is, the, only, school, in, north, america, to, offer, this, the, american, society, of, genealogists, is, the, scholarly, honorary, society, of, the, u, s, genealogical, field, founded, by, john, insley, coddington, arthur, adams, and, meredith, b, colket, jr, in, december, 1940, its, membership, is, limited, to, 50, living, fellows, asg, has, semi, annually, published, the, genealogist, a, scholarly, journal, of, genealogical, research, since, 1980, fellows, of, the, american, society, of, genealogists, who, bear, the, post, nominal, acronym, fasg, have, written, some, of, the, most, notable, genealogical, materials, of, the, last, half, century, some, of, the, most, notable, scholarly, american, genealogical, journals, include, the, american, genealogist, national, genealogical, society, quarterly, the, new, england, historical, and, genealogical, register, the, new, york, genealogical, and, biographical, record, and, the, genealogist, genealogical, research, is, a, complex, process, that, uses, historical, records, and, sometimes, genetic, analysis, to, demonstrate, kinship, reliable, conclusions, are, based, on, the, quality, of, sources, ideally, original, records, the, information, within, those, sources, ideally, primary, or, firsthand, information, and, the, evidence, that, can, be, drawn, directly, or, indirectly, from, that, information, in, many, instances, genealogists, must, skillfully, assemble, indirect, or, circumstantial, evidence, to, build, a, case, for, identity, and, kinship, all, evidence, and, conclusions, together, with, the, documentation, that, supports, them, is, then, assembled, to, create, a, cohesive, genealogy, or, family, history, genealogists, begin, their, research, by, collecting, family, documents, and, stories, this, creates, a, foundation, for, documentary, research, which, involves, examining, and, evaluating, historical, records, for, evidence, about, ancestors, and, other, relatives, their, kinship, ties, and, the, events, that, occurred, in, their, lives, as, a, rule, genealogists, begin, with, the, present, and, work, backwards, in, time, historical, social, and, family, context, is, essential, to, achieving, correct, identification, of, individuals, and, relationships, source, citation, is, also, important, when, conducting, genealogical, research, to, keep, track, of, collected, material, family, group, sheets, and, pedigree, charts, are, used, formerly, handwritten, these, can, now, be, generated, by, genealogical, software, because, a, person, s, dna, contains, information, that, has, been, passed, down, relatively, unchanged, from, early, ancestors, analysis, of, dna, is, sometimes, used, for, genealogical, research, three, dna, types, are, of, particular, interest, mitochondrial, dna, mtdna, is, contained, in, the, mitochondria, of, the, egg, cell, and, is, passed, down, from, a, mother, to, all, of, her, children, both, male, and, female, however, only, females, pass, it, on, to, their, children, y, dna, is, present, only, in, males, and, is, passed, down, from, a, father, to, his, sons, direct, male, line, with, only, minor, mutations, occurring, over, time, autosomal, dna, atdna, is, found, in, the, 22, non, sex, chromosomes, autosomes, and, is, inherited, from, both, parents, thus, it, can, uncover, relatives, from, any, branch, of, the, family, a, genealogical, dna, test, allows, two, individuals, to, find, the, probability, that, they, are, or, are, not, related, within, an, estimated, number, of, generations, individual, genetic, test, results, are, collected, in, databases, to, match, people, descended, from, a, relatively, recent, common, ancestor, see, for, example, the, molecular, genealogy, research, project, some, tests, are, limited, to, either, the, patrilineal, or, the, matrilineal, line, most, genealogy, software, programs, can, export, information, about, persons, and, their, relationships, in, a, standardized, format, called, a, gedcom, in, that, format, it, can, be, shared, with, other, genealogists, added, to, databases, or, converted, into, family, web, sites, social, networking, service, sns, websites, allow, genealogists, to, share, data, and, build, their, family, trees, online, members, can, upload, their, family, trees, and, contact, other, family, historians, to, fill, in, gaps, in, their, research, in, addition, to, the, sns, websites, there, are, other, resources, that, encourage, genealogists, to, connect, and, share, information, such, as, rootsweb, ancestry, com, and, rsl, rootsweb, ancestry, com, volunteer, efforts, figure, prominently, in, genealogy, these, range, from, the, extremely, informal, to, the, highly, organized, on, the, informal, side, are, the, many, popular, and, useful, message, boards, such, as, rootschat, and, mailing, lists, on, particular, surnames, regions, and, other, topics, these, forums, can, be, used, to, try, to, find, relatives, request, record, lookups, obtain, research, advice, and, much, more, many, genealogists, participate, in, loosely, organized, projects, both, online, and, off, these, collaborations, take, numerous, forms, some, projects, prepare, name, indexes, for, records, such, as, probate, cases, and, publish, the, indexes, either, online, or, off, these, indexes, can, be, used, as, finding, aids, to, locate, original, records, other, projects, transcribe, or, abstract, records, offering, record, lookups, for, particular, geographic, areas, is, another, common, service, volunteers, do, record, lookups, or, take, photos, in, their, home, areas, for, researchers, who, are, unable, to, travel, those, looking, for, a, structured, volunteer, environment, can, join, one, of, thousands, of, genealogical, societies, worldwide, most, societies, have, a, unique, area, of, focus, such, as, a, particular, surname, ethnicity, geographic, area, or, descendancy, from, participants, in, a, given, historical, event, genealogical, societies, are, almost, exclusively, staffed, by, volunteers, and, may, offer, a, broad, range, of, services, including, maintaining, libraries, for, members, use, publishing, newsletters, providing, research, assistance, to, the, public, offering, classes, or, seminars, and, organizing, record, preservation, or, transcription, projects, genealogy, software, is, used, to, collect, store, sort, and, display, genealogical, data, at, a, minimum, genealogy, software, accommodates, basic, information, about, individuals, including, births, marriages, and, deaths, many, programs, allow, for, additional, biographical, information, including, occupation, residence, and, notes, and, most, also, offer, a, method, for, keeping, track, of, the, sources, for, each, piece, of, evidence, most, programs, can, generate, basic, kinship, charts, and, reports, allow, for, the, import, of, digital, photographs, and, the, export, of, data, in, the, gedcom, format, short, for, genealogical, data, communication, so, that, data, can, be, shared, with, those, using, other, genealogy, software, more, advanced, features, include, the, ability, to, restrict, the, information, that, is, shared, usually, by, removing, information, about, living, people, out, of, privacy, concerns, the, import, of, sound, files, the, generation, of, family, history, books, web, pages, and, other, publications, the, ability, to, handle, same, sex, marriages, and, children, born, out, of, wedlock, searching, the, internet, for, data, and, the, provision, of, research, guidance, programs, may, be, geared, toward, a, specific, religion, with, fields, relevant, to, that, religion, or, to, specific, nationalities, or, ethnic, groups, with, source, types, relevant, for, those, groups, online, resources, involve, complex, programming, and, large, data, bases, such, as, censuses, genealogists, use, a, wide, variety, of, records, in, their, research, to, effectively, conduct, genealogical, research, it, is, important, to, understand, how, the, records, were, created, what, information, is, included, in, them, and, how, and, where, to, access, them, records, that, are, used, in, genealogy, research, include, to, keep, track, of, their, citizens, governments, began, keeping, records, of, persons, who, were, neither, royalty, nor, nobility, in, england, and, germany, for, example, such, record, keeping, started, with, parish, registers, in, the, 16th, century, as, more, of, the, population, was, recorded, there, were, sufficient, records, to, follow, a, family, major, life, events, such, as, births, marriages, and, deaths, were, often, documented, with, a, license, permit, or, report, genealogists, locate, these, records, in, local, regional, or, national, offices, or, archives, and, extract, information, about, family, relationships, and, recreate, timelines, of, persons, lives, in, china, india, and, other, asian, countries, genealogy, books, are, used, to, record, the, names, occupations, and, other, information, about, family, members, with, some, books, dating, back, hundreds, or, even, thousands, of, years, in, the, eastern, indian, state, of, bihar, there, is, a, written, tradition, of, genealogical, records, among, maithil, brahmins, and, karna, kayasthas, called, panjis, dating, to, the, 12th, century, ce, even, today, these, records, are, consulted, prior, to, marriages, in, ireland, genealogical, records, were, recorded, by, professional, families, of, senchaidh, historians, until, as, late, as, the, mid, 17th, century, perhaps, the, most, outstanding, example, of, this, genre, is, leabhar, na, ngenealach, the, great, book, of, irish, genealogies, by, dubhaltach, macfhirbhisigh, d, 1671, published, in, 2004,

other, reports, to, a, digital, database, for, searching, volunteers, and, professionals, participate, in, the, indexing, process, since, 2006, the, microfilm, in, the, familysearch, granite, mountain, vault, is, in, the, process, of, being, digitally, scanned, available, online, and, eventually, indexed, for, example, after, the, 72, year, legal, limit, for, releasing, personal, information, for, the, united, states, census, was, reached, in, 2012, genealogical, groups, cooperated, to, index, the, 132, million, residents, registered, in, the, 1940, united, states, census, between, 2006, and, 2012, the, familysearch, indexing, effort, produced, more, than, 1, billion, searchable, records, in, 2022, familysearch, and, ancestry, partnered, to, use, artificial, intelligence, ai, technology, to, help, the, process, of, indexing, more, records, the, process, first, began, with, the, public, release, of, the, 1950, united, states, census, the, index, of, the, census, would, at, first, be, created, by, an, ai, trained, on, handwriting, in, old, documents, and, then, reviewed, by, thousands, of, volunteers, using, familysearch, sometimes, genealogical, records, are, destroyed, whether, accidentally, or, on, purpose, in, order, to, do, thorough, research, genealogists, keep, track, of, which, records, have, been, destroyed, so, they, know, when, information, they, need, may, be, missing, of, particular, note, for, north, american, genealogy, is, the, 1890, united, states, census, which, was, destroyed, in, a, fire, in, 1921, although, fragments, survive, most, of, the, 1890, census, no, longer, exists, those, looking, for, genealogical, information, for, families, that, lived, in, the, united, states, in, 1890, must, rely, on, other, information, to, fill, that, gap, war, is, another, cause, of, record, destruction, during, world, war, ii, many, european, records, were, destroyed, communists, in, china, during, the, cultural, revolution, and, in, korea, during, the, korean, war, destroyed, genealogy, books, kept, by, families, often, records, are, destroyed, due, to, accident, or, neglect, since, genealogical, records, are, often, kept, on, paper, and, stacked, in, high, density, storage, they, are, prone, to, fire, mold, insect, damage, and, eventual, disintegration, sometimes, records, of, genealogical, value, are, deliberately, destroyed, by, governments, or, organizations, because, the, records, are, considered, to, be, unimportant, or, a, privacy, risk, because, of, this, genealogists, often, organize, efforts, to, preserve, records, that, are, at, risk, of, destruction, familysearch, has, an, ongoing, program, that, assesses, what, useful, genealogical, records, have, the, most, risk, of, being, destroyed, and, sends, volunteers, to, digitize, such, records, in, 2017, the, government, of, sierra, leone, asked, familysearch, for, help, preserving, their, rapidly, deteriorating, vital, records, familysearch, has, begun, digitizing, the, records, and, making, them, available, online, the, federation, of, genealogical, societies, also, organized, an, effort, to, preserve, and, digitize, united, states, war, of, 1812, pension, records, in, 2010, they, began, raising, funds, which, were, contribute, by, genealogists, around, the, united, states, and, matched, by, ancestry, com, their, goal, was, achieved, and, the, process, of, digitization, was, able, to, begin, the, digitized, records, are, available, for, free, online, genealogists, who, seek, to, reconstruct, the, lives, of, each, ancestor, consider, all, historical, information, to, be, genealogical, information, traditionally, the, basic, information, needed, to, ensure, correct, identification, of, each, person, are, place, names, occupations, family, names, first, names, and, dates, however, modern, genealogists, greatly, expand, this, list, recognizing, the, need, to, place, this, information, in, its, historical, context, in, order, to, properly, evaluate, genealogical, evidence, and, distinguish, between, same, name, individuals, a, great, deal, of, information, is, available, for, british, ancestry, with, growing, resources, for, other, ethnic, groups, family, names, are, simultaneously, one, of, the, most, important, pieces, of, genealogical, information, and, a, source, of, significant, confusion, for, researchers, in, many, cultures, the, name, of, a, person, refers, to, the, family, to, which, they, belong, this, is, called, the, family, name, surname, or, last, name, patronymics, are, names, that, identify, an, individual, based, on, the, father, s, name, for, example, marga, olafsdottir, is, marga, daughter, of, olaf, and, olaf, thorsson, is, olaf, son, of, thor, many, cultures, used, patronymics, before, surnames, were, adopted, or, came, into, use, the, dutch, in, new, york, for, example, used, the, patronymic, system, of, names, until, 1687, when, the, advent, of, english, rule, mandated, surname, usage, in, iceland, patronymics, are, used, by, a, majority, of, the, population, in, denmark, and, norway, patronymics, and, farm, names, were, generally, in, use, through, the, 19th, century, and, beyond, though, surnames, began, to, come, into, fashion, toward, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, in, some, parts, of, the, country, not, until, 1856, in, denmark, and, 1923, in, norway, were, there, laws, requiring, surnames, the, transmission, of, names, across, generations, marriages, and, other, relationships, and, immigration, may, cause, difficulty, in, genealogical, research, for, instance, women, in, many, cultures, have, routinely, used, their, spouse, s, surnames, when, a, woman, remarried, she, may, have, changed, her, name, and, the, names, of, her, children, only, her, name, or, changed, no, names, her, birth, name, maiden, name, may, be, reflected, in, her, children, s, middle, names, her, own, middle, name, or, dropped, entirely, children, may, sometimes, assume, stepparent, foster, parent, or, adoptive, parent, names, because, official, records, may, reflect, many, kinds, of, surname, change, without, explaining, the, underlying, reason, for, the, change, the, correct, identification, of, a, person, recorded, identified, with, more, than, one, name, is, challenging, immigrants, to, america, often, americanized, their, names, surname, data, may, be, found, in, trade, directories, census, returns, birth, death, and, marriage, records, genealogical, data, regarding, given, names, first, names, is, subject, to, many, of, the, same, problems, as, are, family, names, and, place, names, additionally, the, use, of, nicknames, is, very, common, for, example, beth, lizzie, or, betty, are, all, common, for, elizabeth, and, jack, john, and, jonathan, may, be, interchanged, middle, names, provide, additional, information, middle, names, may, be, inherited, follow, naming, customs, or, be, treated, as, part, of, the, family, name, for, instance, in, some, latin, cultures, both, the, mother, s, family, name, and, the, father, s, family, name, are, used, by, the, children, historically, naming, traditions, existed, in, some, places, and, cultures, even, in, areas, that, tended, to, use, naming, conventions, however, they, were, by, no, means, universal, families, may, have, used, them, some, of, the, time, among, some, of, their, children, or, not, at, all, a, pattern, might, also, be, broken, to, name, a, newborn, after, a, recently, deceased, sibling, aunt, or, uncle, an, example, of, a, naming, tradition, from, england, scotland, and, ireland, another, example, is, in, some, areas, of, germany, where, siblings, were, given, the, same, first, name, often, of, a, favourite, saint, or, local, nobility, but, different, second, names, by, which, they, were, known, rufname, if, a, child, died, the, next, child, of, the, same, gender, that, was, born, may, have, been, given, the, same, name, it, is, not, uncommon, that, a, list, of, a, particular, couple, s, children, will, show, one, or, two, names, repeated, personal, names, have, periods, of, popularity, so, it, is, not, uncommon, to, find, many, similarly, named, people, in, a, generation, and, even, similarly, named, families, e, g, william, and, mary, and, their, children, david, mary, and, john, many, names, may, be, identified, strongly, with, a, particular, gender, e, g, william, for, boys, and, mary, for, girls, others, may, be, ambiguous, e, g, lee, or, have, only, slightly, variant, spellings, based, on, gender, e, g, frances, usually, female, and, francis, usually, male, while, the, locations, of, ancestors, residences, and, life, events, are, core, elements, of, the, genealogist, s, quest, they, can, often, be, confusing, place, names, may, be, subject, to, variant, spellings, by, partially, literate, scribes, locations, may, have, identical, or, very, similar, names, for, example, the, village, name, brockton, occurs, six, times, in, the, border, area, between, the, english, counties, of, shropshire, and, staffordshire, shifts, in, political, borders, must, also, be, understood, parish, county, and, national, borders, have, frequently, been, modified, old, records, may, contain, references, to, farms, and, villages, that, have, ceased, to, exist, when, working, with, older, records, from, poland, where, borders, and, place, names, have, changed, frequently, in, past, centuries, a, source, with, maps, and, sample, records, such, as, a, translation, guide, to, 19th, century, polish, language, civil, registration, documents, can, be, invaluable, available, sources, may, include, vital, records, civil, or, church, registration, censuses, and, tax, assessments, oral, tradition, is, also, an, important, source, although, it, must, be, used, with, caution, when, no, source, information, is, available, for, a, location, circumstantial, evidence, may, provide, a, probable, answer, based, on, a, person, s, or, a, family, s, place, of, residence, at, the, time, of, the, event, maps, and, gazetteers, are, important, sources, for, understanding, the, places, researched, they, show, the, relationship, of, an, area, to, neighboring, communities, and, may, be, of, help, in, understanding, migration, patterns, family, tree, mapping, using, online, mapping, tools, such, as, google, earth, particularly, when, used, with, historical, map, overlays, such, as, those, from, the, david, rumsey, historical, map, collection, assist, in, the, process, of, understanding, the, significance, of, geographical, locations, it, is, wise, to, exercise, extreme, caution, with, dates, dates, are, more, difficult, to, recall, years, after, an, event, and, are, more, easily, mistranscribed, than, other, types, of, genealogical, data, therefore, one, should, determine, whether, the, date, was, recorded, at, the, time, of, the, event, or, at, a, later, date, dates, of, birth, in, vital, records, or, civil, registrations, and, in, church, records, at, baptism, are, generally, accurate, because, they, were, usually, recorded, near, the, time, of, the, event, family, bibles, are, often, a, source, for, dates, but, can, be, written, from, memory, long, after, the, event, when, the, same, ink, and, handwriting, is, used, for, all, entries, the, dates, were, probably, written, at, the, same, time, and, therefore, will, be, less, reliable, since, the, earlier, dates, were, probably, recorded, well, after, the, event, the, publication, date, of, the, bible, also, provides, a, clue, about, when, the, dates, were, recorded, since, they, could, not, have, been, recorded, at, any, earlier, date, people, sometimes, reduce, their, age, on, marriage, and, those, under, full, age, may, increase, their, age, in, order, to, marry, or, to, join, the, armed, forces, census, returns, are, notoriously, unreliable, for, ages, or, for, assuming, an, approximate, death, date, ages, over, 15, in, the, 1841, census, in, the, uk, are, rounded, down, to, the, next, lower, multiple, of, five, years, although, baptismal, dates, are, often, used, to, approximate, birth, dates, some, families, waited, years, before, baptizing, children, and, adult, baptisms, are, the, norm, in, some, religions, both, birth, and, marriage, dates, may, have, been, adjusted, to, cover, for, pre, wedding, pregnancies, calendar, changes, must, also, be, considered, in, 1752, england, and, her, american, colonies, changed, from, the, julian, to, the, gregorian, calendar, in, the, same, year, the, date, the, new, year, began, was, changed, prior, to, 1752, it, was, 25, march, this, was, changed, to, 1, january, many, other, european, countries, had, already, made, the, calendar, changes, before, england, had, sometimes, centuries, earlier, by, 1751, there, was, an, 11, day, discrepancy, between, the, date, in, england, and, the, date, in, other, european, countries, for, further, detail, on, the, changes, involved, in, moving, from, the, julian, to, the, gregorian, calendar, see, gregorian, calendar, the, french, republican, calendar, or, french, revolutionary, calendar, was, a, calendar, proposed, during, the, french, revolution, and, used, by, the, french, government, for, about, 12, years, from, late, 1793, to, 1805, and, for, 18, days, in, 1871, in, paris, dates, in, official, records, at, this, time, use, the, revolutionary, calendar, and, need, translating, into, the, gregorian, calendar, for, calculating, ages, etc, there, are, various, websites, which, do, this, occupational, information, may, be, important, to, understanding, an, ancestor, s, life, and, for, distinguishing, two, people, with, the, same, name, a, person, s, occupation, may, have, been, related, to, his, or, her, social, status, political, interest, and, migration, pattern, since, skilled, trades, are, often, passed, from, father, to, son, occupation, may, also, be, indirect, evidence, of, a, family, relationship, it, is, important, to, remember, that, a, person, may, change, occupations, and, that, titles, change, over, time, as, well, some, workers, no, longer, fit, for, their, primary, trade, often, took, less, prestigious, jobs, later, in, life, while, others, moved, upwards, in, prestige, many, unskilled, ancestors, had, a, variety, of, jobs, depending, on, the, season, and, local, trade, requirements, census, returns, may, contain, some, embellishment, e, g, from, labourer, to, mason, or, from, journeyman, to, master, craftsman, names, for, old, or, unfamiliar, local, occupations, may, cause, confusion, if, poorly, legible, for, example, an, ostler, a, keeper, of, horses, and, a, hostler, an, innkeeper, could, easily, be, confused, for, one, another, likewise, descriptions, of, such, occupations, may, also, be, problematic, the, perplexing, description, ironer, of, rabbit, burrows, may, turn, out, to, describe, an, ironer, profession, in, the, bristol, district, named, rabbit, burrows, several, trades, have, regionally, preferred, terms, for, example, shoemaker, and, cordwainer, have, the, same, meaning, finally, many, apparently, obscure, jobs, are, part, of, a, larger, trade, community, such, as, watchmaking, framework, knitting, or, gunmaking, occupational, data, may, be, reported, in, occupational, licences, tax, assessments, membership, records, of, professional, organizations, trade, directories, census, returns, and, vital, records, civil, registration, occupational, dictionaries, are, available, to, explain, many, obscure, and, archaic, trades, information, found, in, historical, or, genealogical, sources, can, be, unreliable, and, it, is, good, practice, to, evaluate, all, sources, with, a, critical, eye, factors, influencing, the, reliability, of, genealogical, information, include, the, knowledge, of, the, informant, or, writer, the, bias, and, mental, state, of, the, informant, or, writer, the, passage, of, time, and, the, potential, for, copying, and, compiling, errors, the, quality, of, census, data, has, been, of, special, interest, to, historians, who, have, investigated, reliability, issues, the, informant, is, the, individual, who, provided, the, recorded, information, genealogists, must, carefully, consider, who, provided, the, information, and, what, they, knew, in, many, cases, the, informant, is, identified, in, the, record, itself, for, example, a, death, certificate, usually, has, two, informants, a, physician, who, provides, information, about, the, time, and, cause, of, death, and, a, family, member, who, provides, the, birth, date, names, of, parents, etc, when, the, informant, is, not, identified, one, can, sometimes, deduce, information, about, the, identity, of, the, person, by, careful, examination, of, the, source, one, should, first, consider, who, was, alive, and, nearby, when, the, record, was, created, when, the, informant, is, also, the, person, recording, the, information, the, handwriting, can, be, compared, to, other, handwriting, samples, when, a, source, does, not, provide, clues, about, the, informant, genealogists, should, treat, the, source, with, caution, these, sources, can, be, useful, if, they, can, be, compared, with, independent, sources, for, example, a, census, record, by, itself, cannot, be, given, much, weight, because, the, informant, is, unknown, however, when, censuses, for, several, years, concur, on, a, piece, of, information, that, would, not, likely, be, guessed, by, a, neighbor, it, is, likely, that, the, information, in, these, censuses, was, provided, by, a, family, member, or, other, informed, person, on, the, other, hand, information, in, a, single, census, cannot, be, confirmed, by, information, in, an, undocumented, compiled, genealogy, since, the, genealogy, may, have, used, the, census, record, as, its, source, and, might, therefore, be, dependent, on, the, same, misinformed, individual, even, individuals, who, had, knowledge, of, the, fact, sometimes, intentionally, or, unintentionally, provided, false, or, misleading, information, a, person, may, have, lied, in, order, to, obtain, a, government, benefit, such, as, a, military, pension, avoid, taxation, or, cover, up, an, embarrassing, situation, such, as, the, existence, of, a, non, marital, child, a, person, with, a, distressed, state, of, mind, may, not, be, able, to, accurately, recall, information, many, genealogical, records, were, recorded, at, the, time, of, a, loved, one, s, death, and, so, genealogists, should, consider, the, effect, that, grief, may, have, had, on, the, informant, of, these, records, the, passage, of, time, often, affects, a, person, s, ability, to, recall, information, therefore, as, a, general, rule, data, recorded, soon, after, the, event, are, usually, more, reliable, than, data, recorded, many, years, later, however, some, types, of, data, are, more, difficult, to, recall, after, many, years, than, others, one, type, especially, prone, to, recollection, errors, is, dates, also, the, ability, to, recall, is, affected, by, the, significance, that, the, event, had, to, the, individual, these, values, may, have, been, affected, by, cultural, or, individual, preferences, genealogists, must, consider, the, effects, that, copying, and, compiling, errors, may, have, had, on, the, information, in, a, source, for, this, reason, sources, are, generally, categorized, in, two, categories, original, and, derivative, an, original, source, is, one, that, is, not, based, on, another, source, a, derivative, source, is, information, taken, from, another, source, this, distinction, is, important, because, each, time, a, source, is, copied, information, about, the, record, may, be, lost, and, errors, may, result, from, the, copyist, misreading, mistyping, or, miswriting, the, information, genealogists, should, consider, the, number, of, times, information, has, been, copied, and, the, types, of, derivation, a, piece, of, information, has, undergone, the, types, of, derivatives, include, photocopies, transcriptions, abstracts, translations, extractions, and, compilations, in, addition, to, copying, errors, compiled, sources, such, as, published, genealogies, and, online, pedigree, databases, are, susceptible, to, misidentification, errors, and, incorrect, conclusions, based, on, circumstantial, evidence, identity, errors, usually, occur, when, two, or, more, individuals, are, assumed, to, be, the, same, person, circumstantial, or, indirect, evidence, does, not, explicitly, answer, a, genealogical, question, but, either, may, be, used, with, other, sources, to, answer, the, question, suggest, a, probable, answer, or, eliminate, certain, possibilities, compilers, sometimes, draw, hasty, conclusions, from, circumstantial, evidence, without, sufficiently, examining, all, available, sources, without, properly, understanding, the, evidence, and, without, appropriately, indicating, the, level, of, uncertainty, in, genealogical, research, information, can, be, obtained, from, primary, or, secondary, sources, primary, sources, are, records, that, were, made, at, the, time, of, the, event, for, example, a, death, certificate, would, be, a, primary, source, for, a, person, s, death, date, and, place, secondary, sources, are, records, that, are, made, days, weeks, months, or, even, years, after, an, event, organizations, that, educate, and, certify, genealogists, have, established, standards, and, ethical, guidelines, they, instruct, genealogists, to, follow, genealogy, research, requires, analyzing, documents, and, drawing, conclusions, based, on, the, evidence, provided, in, the, available, documents, genealogists, need, standards, to, determine, whether, or, not, their, evaluation, of, the, evidence, is, accurate, in, the, past, genealogists, in, the, united, states, borrowed, terms, from, judicial, law, to, examine, evidence, found, in, documents, and, how, they, relate, to, the, researcher, s, conclusions, however, the, differences, between, the, two, disciplines, created, a, need, for, genealogists, to, develop, their, own, standards, in, 2000, the, board, for, certification, of, genealogists, published, their, first, manual, of, standards, the, genealogical, proof, standard, created, by, the, board, for, certification, of, genealogists, is, widely, distributed, in, seminars, workshops, and, educational, materials, for, genealogists, in, the, united, states, other, genealogical, organizations, around, the, world, have, created, similar, standards, they, invite, genealogists, to, follow, such, standards, provide, guidelines, for, genealogists, to, evaluate, their, own, research, as, well, as, the, research, of, others, standards, for, genealogical, research, include, genealogists, often, handle, sensitive, information, and, share, and, publish, such, information, because, of, this, there, is, a, need, for, ethical, standards, and, boundaries, for, when, information, is, too, sensitive, to, be, published, historically, some, genealogists, have, fabricated, information, or, have, otherwise, been, untrustworthy, genealogical, organizations, around, the, world, have, outlined, ethical, standards, as, an, attempt, to, eliminate, such, problems, ethical, standards, adopted, by, various, genealogical, organizations, include, in, 2015, a, committee, presented, standards, for, genetic, genealogy, at, the, salt, lake, institute, of, genealogy, the, standards, emphasize, that, genealogists, and, testing, companies, should, respect, the, privacy, of, clients, and, recognize, the, limits, of, dna, tests, it, also, discusses, how, genealogists, should, thoroughly, document, conclusions, made, using, dna, evidence, in, 2019, the, board, for, the, certification, of, genealogists, officially, updated, their, standards, and, code, of, ethics, to, include, standards, for, genetic, genealogy, general, british, isles, china, continental, europe, north, america, family, history, uk
