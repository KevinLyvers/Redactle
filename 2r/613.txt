tiwanaku, spanish, tiahuanaco, or, tiahuanacu, is, a, pre, columbian, archaeological, site, in, western, bolivia, near, lake, titicaca, about, 70, kilometers, from, la, paz, and, it, is, one, of, the, largest, sites, in, south, america, surface, remains, currently, cover, around, 4, square, kilometers, and, include, decorated, ceramics, monumental, structures, and, megalithic, blocks, it, has, been, conservatively, estimated, that, the, site, was, inhabited, by, 10, 000, to, 20, 000, people, in, ad, 800, the, site, was, first, recorded, in, written, history, in, 1549, by, spanish, conquistador, pedro, cieza, de, le, n, while, searching, for, the, southern, inca, capital, of, qullasuyu, jesuit, chronicler, of, peru, bernab, cobo, reported, that, tiwanaku, s, name, once, was, taypiqala, which, is, aymara, meaning, stone, in, the, center, alluding, to, the, belief, that, it, lay, at, the, center, of, the, world, the, name, by, which, tiwanaku, was, known, to, its, inhabitants, may, have, been, lost, as, they, had, no, written, language, heggarty, and, beresford, jones, suggest, that, the, puquina, language, is, most, likely, to, have, been, the, language, of, tiwanaku, the, dating, of, the, site, has, been, significantly, refined, over, the, last, century, from, 1910, to, 1945, arthur, posnansky, maintained, that, the, site, was, 11, 000, 17, 000, years, old, based, on, comparisons, to, geological, eras, and, archaeoastronomy, beginning, in, the, 1970s, carlos, ponce, sangin, s, proposed, the, site, was, first, occupied, around, 1580, bc, the, site, s, oldest, radiocarbon, date, this, date, is, still, seen, in, some, publications, and, museums, in, bolivia, since, the, 1980s, researchers, have, recognized, this, date, as, unreliable, leading, to, the, consensus, that, the, site, is, no, older, than, 200, or, 300, bc, more, recently, a, statistical, assessment, of, reliable, radiocarbon, dates, estimates, that, the, site, was, founded, around, ad, 110, 50, 170, 68, probability, a, date, supported, by, the, lack, of, ceramic, styles, from, earlier, periods, tiwanaku, began, its, steady, growth, in, the, early, centuries, of, the, first, millennium, ad, from, approximately, 375, to, 700, ad, this, andean, city, grew, to, significance, at, its, height, the, city, of, tiwanaku, spanned, an, area, of, roughly, 4, square, kilometers, 1, 5, square, miles, and, had, a, population, greater, than, 10, 000, individuals, the, growth, of, the, city, was, due, to, its, complex, agropastoral, economy, supported, by, trade, the, site, appeared, to, have, collapsed, around, 1000, ad, however, the, reasoning, behind, this, is, still, open, to, debate, recent, studies, by, geologist, elliott, arnold, of, the, university, of, pittsburgh, have, shown, evidence, of, a, greater, amount, of, aridity, in, the, region, around, the, time, of, collapse, a, drought, in, the, region, would, have, affected, local, systems, of, agriculture, and, likely, played, a, role, in, the, collapse, of, tiwanaku, the, people, of, tiwanaku, held, a, tight, relationship, with, the, wari, culture, the, wari, and, tiwanaku, civilizations, shared, the, same, iconography, referred, to, as, the, southern, andean, iconographic, series, the, relationship, between, the, two, civilizations, is, presumed, to, be, trade, based, or, military, based, the, wari, aren, t, the, only, other, civilization, that, tiwanaku, could, have, had, contact, with, inca, cities, also, contained, similar, types, of, architecture, infrastructure, seen, in, tiwanaku, from, this, it, can, be, expected, that, the, inca, took, some, inspiration, from, the, city, of, tiwanaku, and, other, early, civilizations, in, the, andean, basin, the, structures, that, have, been, excavated, by, researchers, at, tiwanaku, include, the, terraced, platform, mound, akapana, akapana, east, and, pumapunku, stepped, platforms, the, kalasasaya, the, kantatallita, the, kheri, kala, and, putuni, enclosures, and, the, semi, subterranean, temple, the, akapana, is, a, half, andean, cross, shaped, structure, that, is, 257, m, wide, 197, m, broad, at, its, maximum, and, 16, 5, m, tall, at, its, center, appears, to, have, been, a, sunken, court, this, was, nearly, destroyed, by, a, deep, looters, excavation, that, extends, from, the, center, of, this, structure, to, its, eastern, side, material, from, the, looter, s, excavation, was, dumped, off, the, eastern, side, of, the, akapana, a, staircase, is, present, on, its, western, side, possible, residential, complexes, might, have, occupied, both, the, northeast, and, southeast, corners, of, this, structure, originally, the, akapana, was, thought, to, have, been, developed, from, a, modified, hill, twenty, first, century, studies, have, shown, that, it, is, an, entirely, man, made, earthen, mound, faced, with, a, mixture, of, large, and, small, stone, blocks, the, dirt, comprising, akapana, appears, to, have, been, excavated, from, the, moat, that, surrounds, the, site, the, largest, stone, block, within, the, akapana, made, of, andesite, is, estimated, to, weigh, 65, 7, tons, tenon, stone, blocks, in, the, form, of, puma, and, human, heads, stud, the, upper, terraces, the, akapana, east, was, built, on, the, eastern, side, of, early, tiwanaku, later, it, was, considered, a, boundary, between, the, ceremonial, center, and, the, urban, area, it, was, made, of, a, thick, prepared, floor, of, sand, and, clay, which, supported, a, group, of, buildings, yellow, and, red, clay, was, used, in, different, areas, for, what, seems, like, aesthetic, purposes, it, was, swept, clean, of, all, domestic, refuse, signaling, its, great, importance, to, the, culture, the, pumapunku, is, a, man, made, platform, built, on, an, east, west, axis, like, the, akapana, it, is, a, t, shaped, terraced, earthen, platform, mound, faced, with, megalithic, blocks, it, is, 167, 36, m, wide, along, its, north, south, axis, and, 116, 7, m, broad, along, its, east, west, axis, and, is, 5, m, tall, identical, 20, meter, wide, projections, extend, 27, 6, meters, north, and, south, from, the, northeast, and, southeast, corners, of, the, pumapunku, walled, and, unwalled, courts, and, an, esplanade, are, associated, with, this, structure, a, prominent, feature, of, the, pumapunku, is, a, large, stone, terrace, it, is, 6, 75, by, 38, 72, meters, in, dimension, and, paved, with, large, stone, blocks, it, is, called, the, plataforma, l, tica, and, contains, the, largest, stone, block, found, in, the, tiwanaku, site, according, to, ponce, sangines, the, block, is, estimated, to, weigh, 131, metric, tonnes, the, second, largest, stone, block, found, within, the, pumapunku, is, estimated, to, be, 85, metric, tonnes, scattered, around, the, site, of, the, puma, punku, are, various, types, of, cut, stones, due, to, the, complexity, of, the, stonework, the, site, is, often, cited, by, conspiracy, theorists, to, be, a, site, of, ancient, alien, intervention, these, claims, are, entirely, unsubstantiated, the, kalasasaya, is, a, large, courtyard, more, than, 300, feet, long, outlined, by, a, high, gateway, it, is, located, to, the, north, of, the, akapana, and, west, of, the, semi, subterranean, temple, within, the, courtyard, is, where, explorers, found, the, gateway, of, the, sun, since, the, late, 20th, century, researchers, have, theorized, that, this, was, not, the, gateway, s, original, location, near, the, courtyard, is, the, semi, subterranean, temple, a, square, sunken, courtyard, that, is, unique, for, its, north, south, rather, than, east, west, axis, the, walls, are, covered, with, tenon, heads, of, many, different, styles, suggesting, that, the, structure, was, reused, for, different, purposes, over, time, it, was, built, with, walls, of, sandstone, pillars, and, smaller, blocks, of, ashlar, masonry, the, largest, stone, block, in, the, kalasasaya, is, estimated, to, weigh, 26, 95, metric, tons, within, many, of, the, site, s, structures, are, impressive, gateways, the, ones, of, monumental, scale, are, placed, on, artificial, mounds, platforms, or, sunken, courts, one, gateway, shows, the, iconography, of, a, front, facing, figure, in, staff, god, pose, this, iconography, also, is, used, on, some, oversized, vessels, indicating, an, importance, to, the, culture, the, iconography, of, the, gateway, of, the, sun, called, southern, andean, iconographic, series, can, be, seen, on, several, stone, sculptures, qirus, snuff, trays, and, other, tiwanaku, artifacts, the, unique, carvings, on, the, top, of, the, gate, of, the, sun, depict, animals, and, other, beings, some, have, claimed, that, the, symbolism, represents, a, calendar, system, unique, to, the, people, of, tiwanaku, although, there, is, no, definitive, evidence, that, this, theory, is, correct, the, gateway, of, the, sun, and, others, located, at, pumapunku, are, not, complete, they, are, missing, part, of, a, typical, recessed, frame, known, as, a, chambranle, which, typically, have, sockets, for, clamps, to, support, later, additions, these, architectural, examples, as, well, as, the, akapana, gate, have, unique, detail, and, demonstrate, high, skill, in, stone, cutting, this, reveals, a, knowledge, of, descriptive, geometry, the, regularity, of, elements, suggests, they, are, part, of, a, system, of, proportions, many, theories, for, the, skill, of, tiwanaku, s, architectural, construction, have, been, proposed, one, is, that, they, used, a, luk, a, which, is, a, standard, measurement, of, about, sixty, centimeters, another, argument, is, for, the, pythagorean, ratio, this, idea, calls, for, right, triangles, at, a, ratio, of, five, to, four, to, three, used, in, the, gateways, to, measure, all, parts, lastly, protzen, and, nair, argue, that, tiwanaku, had, a, system, set, for, individual, elements, dependent, on, context, and, composition, this, is, shown, in, the, construction, of, similar, gateways, ranging, from, diminutive, to, monumental, size, proving, that, scaling, factors, did, not, affect, proportion, with, each, added, element, the, individual, pieces, were, shifted, to, fit, together, as, the, population, grew, occupational, niches, developed, and, people, began, to, specialize, in, certain, skills, there, was, an, increase, in, artisans, who, worked, in, pottery, jewelry, and, textiles, like, the, later, inca, the, tiwanaku, had, few, commercial, or, market, institutions, instead, the, culture, relied, on, elite, redistribution, that, is, the, elites, of, the, state, controlled, essentially, all, economic, output, but, were, expected, to, provide, each, commoner, with, all, the, resources, needed, to, perform, his, or, her, function, selected, occupations, include, agriculturists, herders, pastoralists, etc, such, separation, of, occupations, was, accompanied, by, hierarchical, stratification, within, the, state, some, authors, believe, that, the, elites, of, tiwanaku, lived, inside, four, walls, that, were, surrounded, by, a, moat, this, theory, is, called, tiwanaku, moat, theory, this, moat, some, believe, was, to, create, the, image, of, a, sacred, island, inside, the, walls, were, many, images, devoted, to, human, origin, which, only, the, elites, would, see, commoners, may, have, entered, this, structure, only, for, ceremonial, purposes, since, it, was, home, to, the, holiest, of, shrines, in, many, andean, cultures, mountains, are, venerated, and, may, be, considered, sacred, objects, the, site, of, tiwanaku, is, located, in, the, valley, between, two, sacred, mountains, pukara, and, chuqi, q, awa, at, such, temples, in, ancient, times, ceremonies, were, conducted, to, honor, and, pay, gratitude, to, the, gods, and, spirits, they, were, places, of, worship, and, rituals, that, helped, unify, andean, peoples, through, shared, symbols, and, pilgrimage, destinations, tiwanaku, became, a, center, of, pre, columbian, religious, ceremonies, for, both, the, general, public, and, elites, for, example, human, sacrifice, was, used, in, several, pre, columbian, civilizations, to, appease, a, god, in, exchange, for, good, fortune, excavations, of, the, akapana, at, tiwanaku, revealed, the, remains, of, sacrificial, dedications, of, humans, and, camelids, researchers, speculate, that, the, akapana, may, also, have, been, used, as, an, astronomical, observatory, it, was, constructed, so, that, it, was, aligned, with, the, peak, of, quimsachata, providing, a, view, of, the, rotation, of, the, milky, way, from, the, southern, pole, other, structures, like, kalasasaya, are, positioned, to, provide, optimal, views, of, the, sunrise, on, the, equinox, summer, solstice, and, winter, solstice, although, the, symbolic, and, functional, value, of, these, monuments, can, only, be, speculated, upon, the, tiwanaku, were, able, to, study, and, interpret, the, positions, of, the, sun, moon, milky, way, and, other, celestial, bodies, well, enough, to, give, them, a, significant, role, in, their, architecture, aymara, legends, place, tiwanaku, at, the, center, of, the, universe, probably, because, of, the, importance, of, its, geographical, location, the, tiwanaku, were, highly, aware, of, their, natural, surroundings, and, would, use, them, and, their, understanding, of, astronomy, as, reference, points, in, their, architectural, plans, the, most, significant, landmarks, in, tiwanaku, are, the, mountains, and, lake, titicaca, the, lake, level, of, lake, titicaca, has, fluctuated, significantly, over, time, the, spiritual, importance, and, location, of, the, lake, contributed, to, the, religious, significance, of, tiwanaku, in, the, tiwanaku, worldview, lake, titicaca, is, the, spiritual, birthplace, of, their, cosmic, beliefs, according, to, incan, mythology, lake, titicaca, is, the, birthplace, of, viracocha, who, was, responsible, for, creating, the, sun, moon, people, and, the, cosmos, in, the, kalasasaya, at, tiwanaku, carved, atop, a, monolith, known, as, the, gate, of, the, sun, is, a, front, facing, figure, holding, a, spear, thrower, and, snuff, some, speculate, that, this, is, a, representation, of, viracocha, however, it, is, also, possible, that, this, figure, represents, a, deity, that, the, aymara, refer, to, as, tunuupa, who, like, viracocha, is, associated, with, legends, of, creation, and, destruction, the, aymara, who, are, thought, to, be, descendants, of, the, tiwanaku, have, a, complex, belief, system, similar, to, the, cosmology, of, several, other, andean, civilizations, they, believe, in, the, existence, of, three, spaces, arajpacha, the, upper, world, akapacha, the, middle, or, inner, world, and, manqhaoacha, the, lower, world, often, associated, with, the, cosmos, and, milky, way, the, upper, world, is, considered, to, be, where, celestial, beings, live, the, middle, world, is, where, all, living, things, are, and, the, lower, world, is, where, life, itself, is, inverted, as, the, site, has, suffered, from, looting, and, amateur, excavations, since, shortly, after, tiwanaku, s, fall, archeologists, must, attempt, to, interpret, it, with, the, understanding, that, materials, have, been, jumbled, and, destroyed, this, destruction, continued, during, the, spanish, conquest, and, colonial, period, and, during, 19th, century, and, the, early, 20th, century, other, damage, was, committed, by, people, quarrying, stone, for, building, and, railroad, construction, and, target, practice, by, military, personnel, no, standing, buildings, have, survived, at, the, modern, site, only, public, non, domestic, foundations, remain, with, poorly, reconstructed, walls, the, ashlar, blocks, used, in, many, of, these, structures, were, mass, produced, in, similar, styles, so, that, they, could, possibly, be, used, for, multiple, purposes, throughout, the, period, of, the, site, certain, buildings, changed, purposes, causing, a, mix, of, artifacts, found, today, detailed, study, of, tiwanaku, began, on, a, small, scale, in, the, mid, nineteenth, century, in, the, 1860s, ephraim, george, squier, visited, the, ruins, and, later, published, maps, and, sketches, completed, during, his, visit, german, geologist, alphons, st, bel, spent, nine, days, in, tiwanaku, in, 1876, creating, a, map, of, the, site, based, on, careful, measurements, he, also, made, sketches, and, created, paper, impressions, of, carvings, and, other, architectural, features, a, book, containing, major, photographic, documentation, was, published, in, 1892, by, engineer, georg, von, grumbkow, with, commentary, by, archaeologist, max, uhle, this, was, the, first, in, depth, scientific, account, of, the, ruins, von, grumbkow, had, first, visited, tiwanaku, between, the, end, of, 1876, and, the, beginning, of, 1877, when, he, accompanied, as, a, photographer, the, expedition, of, french, adventurer, th, odore, ber, financed, by, american, businessman, henry, meiggs, against, ber, s, promise, of, donating, the, artifacts, he, will, find, on, behalf, of, meiggs, to, washington, s, smithsonian, institution, and, the, american, museum, of, natural, history, in, new, york, ber, s, expedition, was, cut, short, by, the, violent, hostility, of, the, local, population, instigated, by, the, catholic, parish, priest, but, von, grumbkow, s, early, pictures, survive, in, the, 1960s, the, bolivian, government, initiated, an, effort, to, restore, the, site, and, reconstruct, part, of, it, the, walls, of, the, kalasasaya, are, almost, all, reconstructed, the, reconstruction, was, not, sufficiently, based, on, evidence, the, reconstruction, does, not, have, as, high, quality, of, stonework, as, was, present, in, tiwanaku, early, visitors, compared, kalasasaya, to, englands, stonehenge, ephraim, squier, called, it, american, stonehenge, before, the, reconstruction, it, had, more, of, a, stonehenge, like, appearance, as, the, filler, stones, between, the, large, stone, pillars, were, all, looted, as, noted, the, gateway, of, the, sun, now, in, the, kalasasaya, is, believed, to, have, been, moved, from, its, original, location, modern, academically, sound, archaeological, excavations, were, performed, from, 1978, through, the, 1990s, by, university, of, chicago, anthropologist, alan, kolata, and, his, bolivian, counterpart, oswaldo, rivera, among, their, contributions, are, the, rediscovery, of, the, suka, kollus, accurate, dating, of, the, civilization, s, growth, and, influence, and, evidence, for, a, drought, based, collapse, of, the, tiwanaku, civilization, archaeologists, such, as, paul, goldstein, have, argued, that, the, tiwanaku, empire, ranged, outside, of, the, altiplano, area, and, into, the, moquegua, valley, in, peru, excavations, at, omo, settlements, show, signs, of, similar, architecture, characteristic, of, tiwanaku, such, as, a, temple, and, terraced, mound, evidence, of, similar, types, of, cranial, vault, modification, in, burials, between, the, omo, site, and, the, main, site, of, tiwanaku, is, also, being, used, for, this, argument, today, tiwanaku, has, been, designated, as, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, administered, by, the, bolivian, government, recently, the, department, of, archaeology, of, bolivia, dinar, directed, by, javier, escalante, has, been, conducting, excavations, on, the, terraced, platform, mound, akapana, the, proyecto, arqueologico, pumapunku, akapana, pumapunku, akapana, archaeological, project, papa, run, by, the, university, of, pennsylvania, has, been, excavating, in, the, area, surrounding, the, terraced, platform, mound, for, the, past, few, years, and, also, conducting, ground, penetrating, radar, surveys, of, the, area, in, former, years, an, archaeological, field, school, offered, through, harvard, s, summer, school, program, conducted, in, the, residential, area, outside, the, monumental, core, has, provoked, controversy, amongst, local, archaeologists, the, program, was, directed, by, gary, urton, of, harvard, who, was, an, expert, on, quipus, and, alexei, vranich, of, the, university, of, pennsylvania, the, controversy, was, over, allowing, a, team, of, untrained, students, to, work, on, the, site, even, under, professional, supervision, it, was, so, important, that, only, certified, professional, archaeologists, with, documented, funding, were, allowed, access, the, controversy, was, charged, with, nationalistic, and, political, undertones, the, harvard, field, school, lasted, for, three, years, beginning, in, 2004, and, ending, in, 2007, the, project, was, not, renewed, in, subsequent, years, nor, was, permission, sought, to, do, so, in, 2009, state, sponsored, restoration, work, on, akapana, was, halted, due, to, a, complaint, from, unesco, the, restoration, had, consisted, of, facing, the, platform, mound, with, adobe, although, researchers, had, not, established, this, as, appropriate, in, 2013, marine, archaeologists, exploring, lake, titicaca, s, khoa, reef, discovered, an, ancient, ceremonial, site, and, lifted, artifacts, such, as, a, lapis, lazuli, and, ceramic, figurines, incense, burners, and, a, ceremonial, medallion, from, the, lake, floor, the, artifacts, are, representative, of, the, lavishness, of, the, ceremonies, and, the, tiwanaku, culture, when, a, topographical, map, of, the, site, was, created, in, 2016, by, the, use, of, a, drone, a, set, of, hitherto, unknown, structures, was, revealed, these, structures, spanned, over, 411, hectares, and, included, a, stone, temple, and, about, one, hundred, circular, or, rectangular, structures, of, vast, dimensions, which, were, possibly, domestic, units, between, 2005, and, 2007, various, types, of, aerial, surveillance, methods, were, used, by, unesco, to, create, an, aerial, picture, of, the, site, lidar, aerial, photography, drones, and, terrestrial, laser, scanning, were, all, used, in, this, process, data, concluded, from, this, research, includes, topographical, maps, that, show, the, principal, structures, at, the, site, along, with, mapping, of, multiple, structures, in, the, mollo, kuntu, area, over, 300, million, data, points, were, placed, from, these, methods, and, have, helped, redefine, main, structures, that, have, not, fully, been, excavated, such, as, the, puma, punku, alan, kolata, of, the, university, of, chicago, conducted, research, at, tiwanaku, in, the, late, 1900s, from, which, he, made, descriptions, of, the, city, and, its, structure, and, culture, in, his, book, the, tiwanaku, he, later, published, valley, of, the, spirits, which, described, more, aspects, of, tiwanaku, culture, such, as, astrology, and, mythology, john, wayne, janusek, of, vanderbilt, university, spent, time, in, the, late, 1900s, as, well, at, the, site, of, tiwanaku, recording, findings, of, the, excavations, going, on, in, 2008, he, published, ancient, tiwanaku, which, described, his, findings, on, the, architecture, agriculture, and, other, aspects, of, tiwanaku, life, jean, pierre, protzen, was, an, architecture, professor, of, the, university, of, california, at, berkeley, and, spent, much, of, his, life, studying, the, architecture, of, tiwanaku, in, 2013, he, published, the, stones, of, tiahuanaco, which, gives, great, descriptions, of, the, architecture, and, stonework, seen, at, tiwanaku, his, work, has, played, a, huge, role, in, creating, potential, reconstructions, of, what, many, of, the, structures, look, like, especially, the, puma, punku
