the, akkadian, empire, k, e, d, i, n, was, the, first, known, ancient, empire, of, mesopotamia, succeeding, the, long, lived, civilization, of, sumer, centered, on, the, city, of, akkad, k, d, and, its, surrounding, region, the, empire, united, akkadian, and, sumerian, speakers, under, one, rule, and, exercised, significant, influence, across, mesopotamia, the, levant, and, anatolia, sending, military, expeditions, as, far, south, as, dilmun, and, magan, modern, united, arab, emirates, saudi, arabia, bahrain, qatar, and, oman, in, the, arabian, peninsula, the, akkadian, empire, reached, its, political, peak, between, the, 24th, and, 22nd, centuries, bc, following, the, conquests, by, its, founder, sargon, of, akkad, under, sargon, and, his, successors, the, akkadian, language, was, briefly, imposed, on, neighboring, conquered, states, such, as, elam, and, gutium, akkad, is, sometimes, regarded, as, the, first, empire, in, history, though, the, meaning, of, this, term, is, not, precise, and, there, are, earlier, sumerian, claimants, epigraphic, sources, from, the, sargonic, akkadian, empire, period, are, in, relatively, short, supply, partly, because, the, capital, akkad, like, the, capitals, of, the, later, mitanni, and, sealand, has, not, yet, been, located, though, there, has, been, much, speculation, some, cuneiform, tablets, have, been, excavated, at, cities, under, akkadian, empire, control, such, as, eshnunna, and, tell, agrab, other, tablets, have, become, available, on, the, antiquities, market, and, are, held, in, museums, and, private, collections, such, as, those, from, the, akkadian, governor, in, adab, internal, evidence, allows, their, dating, to, the, sargonic, period, and, sometimes, to, the, original, location, archives, are, especially, important, to, historians, and, only, a, few, have, become, available, the, me, sag, archive, which, commenced, publication, in, 1958, is, considered, one, of, the, most, significant, collections, the, tablets, about, 500, in, number, with, about, half, published, are, held, primarily, at, the, babylonian, collection, of, the, yale, university, and, baghdad, museum, with, a, few, others, scattered, about, the, tablets, date, to, the, period, of, late, in, the, reign, of, naram, sin, to, early, in, the, reign, of, shar, kali, shari, they, are, believed, to, be, from, a, town, between, umma, and, lagash, and, me, sag, to, be, the, governor, of, umma, an, archive, of, 47, tablets, was, found, at, the, excavation, of, tell, el, suleimah, in, the, hamrin, basin, various, royal, inscriptions, by, the, akkadian, rulers, have, also, been, found, most, of, the, original, examples, are, short, or, very, fragmentary, like, the, victory, stele, of, naram, sin, and, the, sargonic, victory, stele, from, telloh, a, few, longer, ones, are, known, because, of, later, copies, made, often, from, the, much, later, old, babylonian, period, while, these, are, assumed, to, be, mostly, accurate, it, is, difficult, to, know, if, they, had, been, edited, to, reflect, current, political, conditions, one, of, the, longer, surviving, examples, is, the, bassetki, statue, the, copper, base, of, a, narim, sin, statue, naram, sin, the, mighty, king, of, agade, when, the, four, quarters, together, revolted, against, him, through, the, love, which, the, goddess, astar, showed, him, he, was, victorious, in, nine, battles, in, one, in, 1, year, and, the, kings, whom, they, the, rebels, had, raised, against, him, he, captured, in, view, of, the, fact, that, he, protected, the, foundations, of, his, city, from, danger, the, citizens, of, his, city, requested, from, astar, in, eanna, enlil, in, nippur, dagan, in, tuttul, ninhursag, in, kes, ea, in, eridu, sin, in, ur, samas, in, sippar, and, nergal, in, kutha, that, naram, sin, be, made, the, god, of, their, city, and, they, built, within, agade, a, temple, dedicated, to, him, as, for, the, one, who, removes, this, inscription, may, the, gods, samas, astar, nergal, the, bailiff, of, the, king, namely, all, those, gods, mentioned, above, tear, out, his, foundations, and, destroy, his, progeny, a, number, of, fragments, of, royal, statues, of, manishtushu, all, bearing, portions, of, a, standard, inscription, aside, from, a, few, minor, short, inscriptions, this, is, the, only, known, contemporary, source, for, this, ruler, an, excerpt, man, istusu, king, of, the, world, when, he, conquered, ansan, and, sirihum, had, ships, cross, the, lower, sea, the, cities, across, the, sea, thirty, two, in, number, assembled, for, battle, but, he, was, victorious, over, them, further, he, conquered, their, cities, ru, k, down, their, rulers, and, aft, he, plundered, as, far, as, the, silver, mines, he, quarried, the, black, stone, of, the, mountains, across, the, lower, sea, loaded, it, on, ships, and, moored, the, ships, at, the, quay, of, agade, before, the, akkadian, empire, calendar, years, were, marked, by, regnal, numbers, during, sargonic, times, a, system, of, year, names, was, used, this, practice, continued, until, the, end, of, the, old, babylonian, period, for, example, year, in, which, the, divine, hammu, the, king, esznunna, destroyed, by, a, flood, afterwards, regnal, numbers, were, used, by, all, succeeding, kingdoms, during, the, akkadian, empire, 3, of, the, presumed, 40, sargon, year, names, are, known, 1, presumed, 9, of, rimush, 20, presumed, 56, of, naram, sin, and, 18, presumed, 18, of, shar, kali, shari, recently, a, single, year, name, had, been, found, in, the, year, that, d, r, mani, tusu, was, established, there, are, also, perhaps, a, dozen, more, known, which, cannot, be, firmly, linked, to, a, ruler, especially, with, the, paucity, of, other, inscriptions, year, names, are, extremely, important, in, determining, the, history, of, the, akkadian, empire, as, an, example, from, one, year, name, we, know, that, the, empire, was, in, conflict, with, the, gutians, long, before, its, end, it, attests, the, name, of, a, gutian, ruler, and, marks, the, construction, of, two, temples, in, babylon, as, recognition, of, akkadian, victory, in, the, year, in, which, szarkaliszarri, laid, the, foundations, of, the, temples, of, the, goddess, annunitum, and, of, the, god, aba, in, babylon, and, when, he, defeated, szarlak, king, of, gutium, the, final, contemporary, source, are, seals, and, their, sealing, dates, these, are, especially, important, here, as, markers, with, the, shortage, of, other, akkadian, empire, epigraphics, and, very, useful, to, historians, as, an, example, two, seals, and, one, sealing, were, found, in, the, royal, cemetery, at, ur, which, contained, the, name, of, sargons, s, daughter, en, hedu, ana, this, provided, confirmation, of, her, existence, the, seals, read, en, hedu, ana, daughter, of, sargon, ilum, pal, is, her, coiffeur, and, adda, estate, supervisor, majordomo, of, en, hedu, ana, at, tell, mozan, ancient, urkesh, brought, to, light, a, clay, sealing, of, tar, am, agade, akkad, loves, her, a, previously, unknown, daughter, of, naram, sin, who, was, possibly, married, to, an, unidentified, local, endan, ruler, so, great, was, the, akkadian, empire, especially, sargon, and, narim, sin, that, its, history, was, passed, down, for, millennia, this, ranged, on, one, end, to, purported, copies, of, still, existing, sargonic, period, inscriptions, to, literary, tales, made, up, from, the, whole, cloth, at, the, other, a, few, examples, by, the, verdict, of, the, goddess, astar, annunltum, naram, sin, the, mighty, torious, over, the, kisite, in, battle, at, tiwa, ili, resi, the, general, ilum, muda, ibbi, zababa, imtalik, and, puzur, asar, captains, of, kis, and, puzur, ningal, governor, of, tiwa, ili, re, a, his, captain, kullizum, captain, of, eres, edam, u, captain, of, kutha, enlil, brought, out, of, the, mountains, those, who, do, not, resemble, other, people, who, are, not, reckoned, as, part, of, the, land, the, gutians, an, unbridled, people, with, human, intelligence, but, canine, instincts, and, monkeys, features, like, small, birds, they, swooped, on, the, ground, in, great, flocks, because, of, enlil, they, stretched, their, arms, out, across, the, plain, like, a, net, for, animals, nothing, escaped, their, clutches, no, one, left, their, grasp, messengers, no, longer, traveled, the, highways, the, courier, s, boat, no, longer, passed, along, the, rivers, the, gutians, drove, the, trusty, goats, of, enlil, out, of, their, folds, and, compelled, their, herdsmen, to, follow, them, they, drove, the, cows, out, of, their, pens, and, compelled, their, cowherds, to, follow, them, prisoners, manned, the, watch, brigands, occupied, the, highways, the, doors, of, the, city, gates, of, the, land, lay, dislodged, in, mud, and, all, the, foreign, lands, uttered, bitter, cries, from, the, walls, of, their, cities, there, were, a, number, of, these, passed, down, as, part, of, scribel, tradition, including, the, birth, legend, of, sargon, neo, assyrian, weidner, chronicle, and, the, geographical, treatise, on, sargon, of, akkad, s, empire, identifying, architectural, remains, is, hindered, by, the, fact, that, there, are, sometimes, no, clear, distinctions, between, features, thought, to, stem, from, the, preceding, early, dynastic, period, and, those, thought, to, be, akkadian, likewise, material, that, is, thought, to, be, akkadian, continues, to, be, in, use, into, the, ur, iii, period, there, is, a, similar, issue, with, cuneiform, tablets, in, the, early, akkadian, empire, tablets, and, the, signs, on, them, are, much, like, those, from, earlier, periods, before, developing, into, the, much, different, classical, sargonic, style, with, the, capital, akkad, still, unlocated, archaeological, remains, of, the, empire, are, still, to, be, found, mainly, at, the, cities, where, they, established, regional, governors, an, example, is, adab, where, naram, sin, established, direct, imperial, control, after, adab, joined, the, great, revolt, after, destroying, the, city, of, mari, the, akkadian, empire, rebuilt, it, as, an, administrative, center, with, an, imperial, governor, the, city, of, nuzi, was, established, by, the, akkadians, and, a, number, of, economic, and, administrative, texts, were, found, there, similarly, there, are, marad, nippur, tutub, and, ebla, excavation, at, the, modern, site, of, tell, brak, has, suggested, that, the, akkadians, rebuilt, a, city, brak, or, nagar, on, this, site, for, use, as, an, administrative, center, the, city, included, two, large, buildings, including, a, complex, with, temple, offices, courtyard, and, large, ovens, the, akkadian, period, is, generally, dated, to, 2334, 2154, bc, according, to, the, middle, chronology, the, short, chronology, dates, of, 2270, 2083, bc, are, now, considered, less, likely, it, was, preceded, by, the, early, dynastic, period, of, mesopotamia, ed, and, succeeded, by, the, ur, iii, period, although, both, transitions, are, blurry, for, example, it, is, likely, that, the, rise, of, sargon, of, akkad, coincided, with, the, late, ed, period, and, that, the, final, akkadian, kings, ruled, simultaneously, with, the, gutian, kings, alongside, rulers, at, the, city, states, of, both, uruk, and, lagash, the, akkadian, period, is, contemporary, with, eb, iv, in, israel, eb, iva, and, ej, iv, in, syria, and, eb, iiib, in, turkey, the, relative, order, of, akkadian, kings, is, clear, while, noting, that, the, ur, iii, version, of, the, sumerian, king, list, inverts, the, order, of, rimush, and, manishtushu, the, absolute, dates, of, their, reigns, are, approximate, as, with, all, dates, prior, to, the, late, bronze, age, collapse, c, 1200, bc, the, akkadian, empire, takes, its, name, from, the, region, and, the, city, of, akkad, both, of, which, were, localized, in, the, general, confluence, area, of, the, tigris, and, euphrates, rivers, although, the, city, of, akkad, has, not, yet, been, identified, on, the, ground, it, is, known, from, various, textual, sources, among, these, is, at, least, one, text, predating, the, reign, of, sargon, together, with, the, fact, that, the, name, akkad, is, of, non, akkadian, origin, this, suggests, that, the, city, of, akkad, may, have, already, been, occupied, in, pre, sargonic, times, the, bible, refers, to, akkad, in, genesis, 10, 10, 12, which, states, the, beginning, of, his, nimrod, s, kingdom, was, babel, and, erech, and, accad, and, calneh, in, the, land, of, shinar, out, of, that, land, he, went, forth, into, assyria, and, built, nineveh, and, rehoboth, ir, and, calah, and, resen, between, nineveh, and, calah, the, same, is, the, great, city, nimrod, s, historical, identity, is, unknown, or, debated, but, nimrod, has, been, identified, as, sargon, of, akkad, by, some, and, others, have, compared, him, with, the, legendary, gilgamesh, king, of, uruk, erech, sargon, of, akkad, defeated, and, captured, lugal, zage, si, in, the, battle, of, uruk, and, conquered, his, empire, the, earliest, records, in, the, akkadian, language, date, to, the, time, of, sargon, sargon, was, claimed, to, be, the, son, of, la, ibum, or, itti, bel, a, humble, gardener, and, possibly, a, hierodule, or, priestess, to, ishtar, or, inanna, one, legend, related, to, sargon, in, neo, assyrian, times, says, that, my, mother, was, a, changeling, my, father, i, knew, not, the, brothers, of, my, father, loved, the, hills, my, city, is, azurpiranu, the, wilderness, herb, fields, which, is, situated, on, the, banks, of, the, euphrates, my, changeling, mother, conceived, me, in, secret, she, bore, me, she, set, me, in, a, basket, of, rushes, with, bitumen, she, sealed, my, lid, she, cast, me, into, the, river, which, rose, not, over, me, the, river, bore, me, up, and, carried, me, to, akki, the, drawer, of, water, akki, the, drawer, of, water, took, me, as, his, son, and, reared, me, akki, the, drawer, of, water, appointed, me, as, his, gardener, while, i, was, gardener, ishtar, granted, me, her, love, and, for, four, and, fifty, years, i, exercised, kingship, later, claims, made, on, behalf, of, sargon, were, that, his, mother, was, an, entu, priestess, high, priestess, the, claims, might, have, been, made, to, ensure, a, pedigree, of, nobility, since, only, a, highly, placed, family, could, achieve, such, a, position, originally, a, cupbearer, rabshakeh, to, a, king, of, kish, with, a, semitic, name, ur, zababa, sargon, thus, became, a, gardener, responsible, for, the, task, of, clearing, out, irrigation, canals, the, royal, cupbearer, at, this, time, was, in, fact, a, prominent, political, position, close, to, the, king, and, with, various, high, level, responsibilities, not, suggested, by, the, title, of, the, position, itself, this, gave, him, access, to, a, disciplined, corps, of, workers, who, also, may, have, served, as, his, first, soldiers, displacing, ur, zababa, sargon, was, crowned, king, and, he, entered, upon, a, career, of, foreign, conquest, four, times, he, invaded, syria, and, canaan, and, he, spent, three, years, thoroughly, subduing, the, countries, of, the, west, to, unite, them, with, mesopotamia, into, a, single, empire, however, sargon, took, this, process, further, conquering, many, of, the, surrounding, regions, to, create, an, empire, that, reached, westward, as, far, as, the, mediterranean, sea, and, perhaps, cyprus, kaptara, northward, as, far, as, the, mountains, a, later, hittite, text, asserts, he, fought, the, hattian, king, nurdaggal, of, burushanda, well, into, anatolia, eastward, over, elam, and, as, far, south, as, magan, oman, a, region, over, which, he, reigned, for, purportedly, 56, years, though, only, four, year, names, survive, he, consolidated, his, dominion, over, his, territories, by, replacing, the, earlier, opposing, rulers, with, noble, citizens, of, akkad, his, native, city, where, loyalty, was, thus, ensured, trade, extended, from, the, silver, mines, of, anatolia, to, the, lapis, lazuli, mines, in, modern, afghanistan, the, cedars, of, lebanon, and, the, copper, of, magan, this, consolidation, of, the, city, states, of, sumer, and, akkad, reflected, the, growing, economic, and, political, power, of, mesopotamia, the, empire, s, breadbasket, was, the, rain, fed, agricultural, system, and, a, chain, of, fortresses, was, built, to, control, the, imperial, wheat, production, images, of, sargon, were, erected, on, the, shores, of, the, mediterranean, in, token, of, his, victories, and, cities, and, palaces, were, built, at, home, with, the, spoils, of, the, conquered, lands, elam, and, the, northern, part, of, mesopotamia, were, also, subjugated, and, rebellions, in, sumer, were, put, down, contract, tablets, have, been, found, dated, in, the, years, of, the, campaigns, against, canaan, and, against, sarlak, king, of, gutium, he, also, boasted, of, having, subjugated, the, four, quarters, the, lands, surrounding, akkad, to, the, north, the, south, sumer, the, east, elam, and, the, west, martu, some, of, the, earliest, historiographic, texts, abc, 19, 20, suggest, he, rebuilt, the, city, of, babylon, bab, ilu, in, its, new, location, near, akkad, sargon, throughout, his, long, life, showed, special, deference, to, the, sumerian, deities, particularly, inanna, ishtar, his, patroness, and, zababa, the, warrior, god, of, kish, he, called, himself, the, anointed, priest, of, anu, and, the, great, ensi, of, enlil, and, his, daughter, enheduanna, was, installed, as, priestess, to, nanna, at, the, temple, in, ur, troubles, multiplied, toward, the, end, of, his, reign, a, later, babylonian, text, states, in, his, old, age, all, the, lands, revolted, against, him, and, they, besieged, him, in, akkad, the, city, he, went, forth, to, battle, and, defeated, them, he, knocked, them, over, and, destroyed, their, vast, army, it, refers, to, his, campaign, in, elam, where, he, defeated, a, coalition, army, led, by, the, king, of, awan, and, forced, the, vanquished, to, become, his, vassals, also, shortly, after, another, revolt, took, place, the, subartu, the, upper, country, in, their, turn, attacked, but, they, submitted, to, his, arms, and, sargon, settled, their, habitations, and, he, smote, them, grievously, sargon, had, crushed, opposition, even, at, old, age, these, difficulties, broke, out, again, in, the, reign, of, his, sons, where, revolts, broke, out, during, the, nine, year, reign, of, rimush, 2278, 2270, bc, who, fought, hard, to, retain, the, empire, and, was, successful, until, he, was, assassinated, by, some, of, his, own, courtiers, according, to, his, inscriptions, he, faced, widespread, revolts, and, had, to, reconquer, the, cities, of, ur, umma, adab, lagash, der, and, kazallu, from, rebellious, ensis, rimush, introduced, mass, slaughter, and, large, scale, destruction, of, the, sumerian, city, states, and, maintained, meticulous, records, of, his, destructions, most, of, the, major, sumerian, cities, were, destroyed, and, sumerian, human, losses, were, enormous, rimush, s, elder, brother, manishtushu, 2269, 2255, bc, succeeded, him, the, latter, seems, to, have, fought, a, sea, battle, against, 32, kings, who, had, gathered, against, him, and, took, control, over, their, pre, arab, country, consisting, of, modern, day, united, arab, emirates, and, oman, despite, the, success, like, his, brother, he, seems, to, have, been, assassinated, in, a, palace, conspiracy, manishtushu, s, son, and, successor, naram, sin, 2254, 2218, bc, due, to, vast, military, conquests, assumed, the, imperial, title, king, naram, sin, king, of, the, four, quarters, lugal, naram, s, n, ar, kibrat, arbaim, the, four, quarters, as, a, reference, to, the, entire, world, he, was, also, for, the, first, time, in, sumerian, culture, addressed, as, the, god, sumerian, dingir, akkadian, ilu, of, agade, akkad, in, opposition, to, the, previous, religious, belief, that, kings, were, only, representatives, of, the, people, towards, the, gods, he, also, faced, revolts, at, the, start, of, his, reign, but, quickly, crushed, them, naram, sin, also, recorded, the, akkadian, conquest, of, ebla, as, well, as, armanum, and, its, king, to, better, police, syria, he, built, a, royal, residence, at, tell, brak, a, crossroads, at, the, heart, of, the, khabur, river, basin, of, the, jezirah, naram, sin, campaigned, against, magan, which, also, revolted, naram, sin, marched, against, magan, and, personally, caught, mandannu, its, king, where, he, instated, garrisons, to, protect, the, main, roads, the, chief, threat, seemed, to, be, coming, from, the, northern, zagros, mountains, the, lulubis, and, the, gutians, a, campaign, against, the, lullubi, led, to, the, carving, of, the, victory, stele, of, naram, suen, now, in, the, louvre, hittite, sources, claim, naram, sin, of, akkad, even, ventured, into, anatolia, battling, the, hittite, and, hurrian, kings, pamba, of, hatti, zipani, of, kanesh, and, 15, others, the, economy, was, highly, planned, grain, was, cleaned, and, rations, of, grain, and, oil, were, distributed, in, standardized, vessels, made, by, the, city, s, potters, taxes, were, paid, in, produce, and, labour, on, public, walls, including, city, walls, temples, irrigation, canals, and, waterways, producing, huge, agricultural, surpluses, this, newfound, akkadian, wealth, may, have, been, based, upon, benign, climatic, conditions, huge, agricultural, surpluses, and, the, confiscation, of, the, wealth, of, other, peoples, in, later, assyrian, and, babylonian, texts, the, name, akkad, together, with, sumer, appears, as, part, of, the, royal, title, as, in, the, sumerian, lugal, ki, en, gi, ki, uri, or, akkadian, ar, m, t, umeri, u, akkadi, translating, to, king, of, sumer, and, akkad, this, title, was, assumed, by, the, king, who, seized, control, of, nippur, the, intellectual, and, religious, center, of, southern, mesopotamia, during, the, akkadian, period, the, akkadian, language, became, the, lingua, franca, of, the, middle, east, and, was, officially, used, for, administration, although, the, sumerian, language, remained, as, a, spoken, and, literary, language, the, spread, of, akkadian, stretched, from, syria, to, elam, and, even, the, elamite, language, was, temporarily, written, in, mesopotamian, cuneiform, akkadian, texts, later, found, their, way, to, far, off, places, from, egypt, in, the, amarna, period, and, anatolia, to, persia, behistun, the, submission, of, some, sumerian, rulers, to, the, akkadian, empire, is, recorded, in, the, seal, inscriptions, of, sumerian, rulers, such, as, lugal, ushumgal, governor, ensi, of, lagash, shirpula, circa, 2230, 2210, bc, several, inscriptions, of, lugal, ushumgal, are, known, particularly, seal, impressions, which, refer, to, him, as, governor, of, lagash, and, at, the, time, a, vassal, arad, servant, or, slave, of, naram, sin, as, well, as, his, successor, shar, kali, sharri, one, of, these, seals, proclaims, naram, sin, the, mighty, god, of, agade, king, of, the, four, corners, of, the, world, lugal, ushumgal, the, scribe, ensi, of, lagash, is, thy, servant, it, can, be, considered, that, lugal, ushumgal, was, a, collaborator, of, the, akkadian, empire, as, was, meskigal, ruler, of, adab, later, however, lugal, ushumgal, was, succeeded, by, puzer, mama, who, as, akkadian, power, waned, achieved, independence, from, shar, kali, sharri, assuming, the, title, of, king, of, lagash, and, starting, the, illustrious, second, dynasty, of, lagash, the, empire, of, akkad, likely, fell, in, the, 22nd, century, bc, within, 180, years, of, its, founding, ushering, in, a, dark, age, with, no, prominent, imperial, authority, until, the, third, dynasty, of, ur, the, region, s, political, structure, may, have, reverted, to, the, status, quo, ante, of, local, governance, by, city, states, by, the, end, of, sharkalisharri, s, reign, the, empire, had, begun, to,

little, is, known, about, the, gutian, period, or, how, long, it, endured, cuneiform, sources, suggest, that, the, gutians, administration, showed, little, concern, for, maintaining, agriculture,

a, purely, literary, or, liturgical, language, much, as, latin, later, became, in, medieval, europe, one, explanation, for, the, end, of, the, akkadian, empire, is, simply, that, the, akkadian, dynasty, could, not, maintain, its, political, supremacy, over, other, independently, powerful, city, states, one, theory, which, remains, controversial, associates, regional, decline, at, the, end, of, the, akkadian, period, and, of, the, first, intermediary, period, following, the, old, kingdom, in, ancient, egypt, with, rapidly, increasing, aridity, and, failing, rainfall, in, the, region, of, the, ancient, near, east, caused, by, a, global, centennial, scale, drought, sometimes, called, the, 4, 2, kiloyear, event, harvey, weiss, has, shown, that, rchaeological, and, soil, stratigraphic, data, define, the, origin, growth, and, collapse, of, subir, the, third, millennium, rain, fed, agriculture, civilization, of, northern, mesopotamia, on, the, habur, plains, of, syria, at, 2200, bc, a, marked, increase, in, aridity, and, wind, circulation, subsequent, to, a, volcanic, eruption, induced, a, considerable, degradation, of, land, use, conditions, after, four, centuries, of, urban, life, this, abrupt, climatic, change, evidently, caused, abandonment, of, tell, leilan, regional, desertion, and, the, collapse, of, the, akkadian, empire, based, in, southern, mesopotamia, synchronous, collapse, in, adjacent, regions, suggests, that, the, impact, of, the, abrupt, climatic, change, was, extensive, peter, b, de, menocal, has, shown, there, was, an, influence, of, the, north, atlantic, oscillation, on, the, streamflow, of, the, tigris, and, euphrates, at, this, time, which, led, to, the, collapse, of, the, akkadian, empire, more, recent, analysis, of, simulations, from, the, hadcm3, climate, model, indicate, that, there, was, a, shift, to, a, more, arid, climate, on, a, timescale, that, is, consistent, with, the, collapse, of, the, empire, excavation, at, tell, leilan, suggests, that, this, site, was, abandoned, soon, after, the, city, s, massive, walls, were, constructed, its, temple, rebuilt, and, its, grain, production, reorganized, the, debris, dust, and, sand, that, followed, show, no, trace, of, human, activity, soil, samples, show, fine, wind, blown, sand, no, trace, of, earthworm, activity, reduced, rainfall, and, indications, of, a, drier, and, windier, climate, evidence, shows, that, skeleton, thin, sheep, and, cattle, died, of, drought, and, up, to, 28, 000, people, abandoned, the, site, presumably, seeking, wetter, areas, elsewhere, tell, brak, shrank, in, size, by, 75, trade, collapsed, nomadic, herders, such, as, the, amorites, moved, herds, closer, to, reliable, water, suppliers, bringing, them, into, conflict, with, akkadian, populations, this, climate, induced, collapse, seems, to, have, affected, the, whole, of, the, middle, east, and, to, have, coincided, with, the, collapse, of, the, egyptian, old, kingdom, this, collapse, of, rain, fed, agriculture, in, the, upper, country, meant, the, loss, to, southern, mesopotamia, of, the, agrarian, subsidies, which, had, kept, the, akkadian, empire, solvent, water, levels, within, the, tigris, and, euphrates, fell, 1, 5, meters, beneath, the, level, of, 2600, bc, and, although, they, stabilized, for, a, time, during, the, following, ur, iii, period, rivalries, between, pastoralists, and, farmers, increased, attempts, were, undertaken, to, prevent, the, former, from, herding, their, flocks, in, agricultural, lands, such, as, the, building, of, a, 180, km, 112, mi, wall, known, as, the, repeller, of, the, amorites, between, the, tigris, and, euphrates, under, the, ur, iii, ruler, shu, sin, such, attempts, led, to, increased, political, instability, meanwhile, severe, depression, occurred, to, re, establish, demographic, equilibrium, with, the, less, favorable, climatic, conditions, richard, zettler, has, critiqued, the, drought, theory, observing, that, the, chronology, of, the, akkadian, empire, is, very, uncertain, and, that, available, evidence, is, not, sufficient, to, show, its, economic, dependence, on, the, northern, areas, excavated, by, weiss, and, others, he, also, criticizes, weiss, for, taking, akkadian, writings, literally, to, describe, certain, catastrophic, events, according, to, joan, oates, at, tell, brak, the, soil, signal, associated, with, the, drought, lies, below, the, level, of, naram, sin, s, palace, however, evidence, may, suggest, a, tightening, of, akkadian, control, following, the, brak, event, for, example, the, construction, of, the, heavily, fortified, palace, itself, and, the, apparent, introduction, of, greater, numbers, of, akkadian, as, opposed, to, local, officials, perhaps, a, reflection, of, unrest, in, the, countryside, of, the, type, that, often, follows, some, natural, catastrophe, furthermore, brak, remained, occupied, and, functional, after, the, fall, of, the, akkadians, in, 2019, a, study, by, hokkaido, university, on, fossil, corals, in, oman, provides, an, evidence, that, prolonged, winter, shamal, seasons, led, to, the, salinization, of, the, irrigated, fields, hence, a, dramatic, decrease, in, crop, production, triggered, a, widespread, famine, and, eventually, the, collapse, of, the, ancient, akkadian, empire, the, akkadian, government, formed, a, classical, standard, with, which, all, future, mesopotamian, states, compared, themselves, traditionally, the, ensi, was, the, highest, functionary, of, the, sumerian, city, states, in, later, traditions, one, became, an, ensi, by, marrying, the, goddess, inanna, legitimising, the, rulership, through, divine, consent, initially, the, monarchical, lugal, lu, man, gal, great, was, subordinate, to, the, priestly, ensi, and, was, appointed, at, times, of, troubles, but, by, later, dynastic, times, it, was, the, lugal, who, had, emerged, as, the, preeminent, role, having, his, own, house, or, palace, independent, from, the, temple, establishment, by, the, time, of, mesalim, whichever, dynasty, controlled, the, city, of, kish, was, recognised, as, ar, ki, ati, king, of, kish, and, was, considered, preeminent, in, sumer, possibly, because, this, was, where, the, two, rivers, approached, and, whoever, controlled, kish, ultimately, controlled, the, irrigation, systems, of, the, other, cities, downstream, as, sargon, extended, his, conquest, from, the, lower, sea, persian, gulf, to, the, upper, sea, mediterranean, it, was, felt, that, he, ruled, the, totality, of, the, lands, under, heaven, or, from, sunrise, to, sunset, as, contemporary, texts, put, it, under, sargon, the, ensi, s, generally, retained, their, positions, but, were, seen, more, as, provincial, governors, the, title, ar, ki, ati, became, recognised, as, meaning, lord, of, the, universe, sargon, is, even, recorded, as, having, organised, naval, expeditions, to, dilmun, bahrain, and, magan, amongst, the, first, organised, military, naval, expeditions, in, history, whether, he, also, did, in, the, case, of, the, mediterranean, with, the, kingdom, of, kaptara, possibly, cyprus, as, claimed, in, later, documents, is, more, questionable, with, naram, sin, sargon, s, grandson, this, went, further, than, with, sargon, with, the, king, not, only, being, called, lord, of, the, four, quarters, of, the, earth, but, also, elevated, to, the, ranks, of, the, dingir, gods, with, his, own, temple, establishment, previously, a, ruler, could, like, gilgamesh, become, divine, after, death, but, the, akkadian, kings, from, naram, sin, onward, were, considered, gods, on, earth, in, their, lifetimes, their, portraits, showed, them, of, larger, size, than, mere, mortals, and, at, some, distance, from, their, retainers, one, strategy, adopted, by, both, sargon, and, naram, sin, to, maintain, control, of, the, country, was, to, install, their, daughters, enheduanna, and, emmenanna, respectively, as, high, priestess, to, sin, the, akkadian, version, of, the, sumerian, moon, deity, nanna, at, ur, in, the, extreme, south, of, sumer, to, install, sons, as, provincial, ensi, governors, in, strategic, locations, and, to, marry, their, daughters, to, rulers, of, peripheral, parts, of, the, empire, urkesh, and, marhashe, a, well, documented, case, of, the, latter, is, that, of, naram, sin, s, daughter, tar, am, agade, at, urkesh, records, at, the, brak, administrative, complex, suggest, that, the, akkadians, appointed, locals, as, tax, collectors, the, population, of, akkad, like, nearly, all, pre, modern, states, was, entirely, dependent, upon, the, agricultural, systems, of, the, region, which, seem, to, have, had, two, principal, centres, the, irrigated, farmlands, of, southern, iraq, that, traditionally, had, a, yield, of, 30, grains, returned, for, each, grain, sown, and, the, rain, fed, agriculture, of, northern, iraq, known, as, the, upper, country, southern, iraq, during, akkadian, period, seems, to, have, been, approaching, its, modern, rainfall, level, of, less, than, 20, mm, 0, 8, in, per, year, with, the, result, that, agriculture, was, totally, dependent, upon, irrigation, before, the, akkadian, period, the, progressive, salinisation, of, the, soils, produced, by, poorly, drained, irrigation, had, been, reducing, yields, of, wheat, in, the, southern, part, of, the, country, leading, to, the, conversion, to, more, salt, tolerant, barley, growing, urban, populations, there, had, peaked, already, by, 2, 600, bc, and, demographic, pressures, were, high, contributing, to, the, rise, of, militarism, apparent, immediately, before, the, akkadian, period, as, seen, in, the, stele, of, the, vultures, of, eannatum, warfare, between, city, states, had, led, to, a, population, decline, from, which, akkad, provided, a, temporary, respite, it, was, this, high, degree, of, agricultural, productivity, in, the, south, that, enabled, the, growth, of, the, highest, population, densities, in, the, world, at, this, time, giving, akkad, its, military, advantage, the, water, table, in, this, region, was, very, high, and, replenished, regularly, by, winter, storms, in, the, headwaters, of, the, tigris, and, euphrates, from, october, to, march, and, from, snow, melt, from, march, to, july, flood, levels, that, had, been, stable, from, about, 3, 000, to, 2, 600, bc, had, started, falling, and, by, the, akkadian, period, were, a, half, meter, to, a, meter, lower, than, recorded, previously, even, so, the, flat, country, and, weather, uncertainties, made, flooding, much, more, unpredictable, than, in, the, case, of, the, nile, serious, deluges, seem, to, have, been, a, regular, occurrence, requiring, constant, maintenance, of, irrigation, ditches, and, drainage, systems, farmers, were, recruited, into, regiments, for, this, work, from, august, to, october, a, period, of, food, shortage, under, the, control, of, city, temple, authorities, thus, acting, as, a, form, of, unemployment, relief, gwendolyn, leick, has, suggested, that, this, was, sargon, s, original, employment, for, the, king, of, kish, giving, him, experience, in, effectively, organising, large, groups, of, men, a, tablet, reads, sargon, the, king, to, whom, enlil, permitted, no, rival, 5, 400, warriors, ate, bread, daily, before, him, harvest, was, in, the, late, spring, and, during, the, dry, summer, months, nomadic, amorites, from, the, northwest, pastured, their, flocks, of, sheep, and, goats, to, graze, on, the, crop, residue, and, were, watered, from, the, river, and, irrigation, canals, for, this, privilege, they, had, to, pay, a, tax, in, wool, meat, milk, and, cheese, to, the, temples, who, distributed, these, products, to, the, bureaucracy, and, priesthood, in, good, years, all, went, well, but, in, bad, years, wild, winter, pastures, were, in, short, supply, nomads, sought, to, pasture, their, flocks, in, the, grain, fields, resulting, in, conflicts, with, farmers, it, appeared, that, the, subsidizing, of, southern, populations, by, the, import, of, wheat, from, the, north, of, the, empire, temporarily, overcame, this, problem, and, it, seems, to, have, allowed, economic, recovery, and, a, growing, population, within, this, region, as, a, result, sumer, and, akkad, had, a, surplus, of, agricultural, products, but, was, short, of, almost, everything, else, particularly, metal, ores, timber, and, building, stone, all, of, which, had, to, be, imported, the, spread, of, the, akkadian, state, as, far, as, the, silver, mountain, possibly, the, taurus, mountains, the, cedars, of, lebanon, and, the, copper, deposits, of, magan, was, largely, motivated, by, the, goal, of, securing, control, over, these, imports, one, tablet, an, old, babylonian, period, copy, of, an, original, inscription, reads, sargon, the, king, of, kish, triumphed, in, thirty, four, battles, over, the, cities, up, to, the, edge, of, the, sea, and, destroyed, their, walls, he, made, the, ships, from, meluhha, the, ships, from, magan, and, the, ships, from, dilmun, tie, up, alongside, the, quay, of, agade, sargon, the, king, prostrated, himself, before, the, god, dagan, and, made, supplication, to, him, and, he, dagan, gave, him, the, upper, land, namely, mari, yarmuti, and, ebla, up, to, the, cedar, forest, and, up, to, the, silver, mountain, international, trade, developed, during, the, akkadian, period, indus, mesopotamia, relations, also, seem, to, have, expanded, sargon, of, akkad, circa, 2300, or, 2250, bc, was, the, first, mesopotamian, ruler, to, make, an, explicit, reference, to, the, region, of, meluhha, which, is, generally, understood, as, being, the, balochistan, or, the, indus, area, in, art, there, was, a, great, emphasis, on, the, kings, of, the, dynasty, alongside, much, that, continued, earlier, sumerian, art, little, architecture, remains, in, large, works, and, small, ones, such, as, seals, the, degree, of, realism, was, considerably, increased, but, the, seals, show, a, grim, world, of, cruel, conflict, of, danger, and, uncertainty, a, world, in, which, man, is, subjected, without, appeal, to, the, incomprehensible, acts, of, distant, and, fearful, divinities, who, he, must, serve, but, cannot, love, this, sombre, mood, remained, characteristic, of, mesopotamian, art, akkadian, sculpture, is, remarkable, for, its, fineness, and, realism, which, shows, a, clear, advancement, compared, to, the, previous, period, of, sumerian, art, the, akkadians, used, visual, arts, as, a, vehicle, of, ideology, they, developed, a, new, style, for, cylinder, seals, by, reusing, traditional, animal, decorations, but, organizing, them, around, inscriptions, which, often, became, central, parts, of, the, layout, the, figures, also, became, more, sculptural, and, naturalistic, new, elements, were, also, included, especially, in, relation, to, the, rich, akkadian, mythology, during, the, 3rd, millennium, bc, there, developed, a, very, intimate, cultural, symbiosis, between, the, sumerians, and, the, akkadians, which, included, widespread, bilingualism, the, influence, of, sumerian, on, akkadian, and, vice, versa, is, evident, in, all, areas, from, lexical, borrowing, on, a, massive, scale, to, syntactic, morphological, and, phonological, convergence, this, has, prompted, scholars, to, refer, to, sumerian, and, akkadian, in, the, third, millennium, as, a, sprachbund, akkadian, gradually, replaced, sumerian, as, a, spoken, language, somewhere, around, 2000, bc, the, exact, dating, being, a, matter, of, debate, but, sumerian, continued, to, be, used, as, a, sacred, ceremonial, literary, and, scientific, language, in, mesopotamia, until, the, 1st, century, ad, sumerian, literature, continued, in, rich, development, during, the, akkadian, period, enheduanna, the, wife, sumerian, dam, high, priestess, of, nanna, and, daughter, of, sargon, of, the, temple, of, sin, at, ur, who, lived, c, 2285, 2250, bc, is, the, first, poet, in, history, whose, name, is, known, her, known, works, include, hymns, to, the, goddess, inanna, the, exaltation, of, inanna, and, in, nin, sa, gur, ra, a, third, work, the, temple, hymns, a, collection, of, specific, hymns, addresses, the, temples, and, their, occupants, the, deities, to, whom, they, were, consecrated, the, works, of, this, poet, are, significant, because, although, they, start, out, using, the, third, person, they, shift, to, the, first, person, voice, of, the, poet, herself, and, they, mark, a, significant, development, in, the, use, of, cuneiform, as, poet, princess, and, priestess, she, was, a, person, who, according, to, william, w, hallo, set, standards, in, all, three, of, her, roles, for, many, succeeding, centuries, in, the, exultation, of, inanna, enheduanna, depicts, inanna, as, disciplining, mankind, as, a, goddess, of, battle, she, thereby, unites, the, warlike, akkadian, ishtar, s, qualities, to, those, of, the, gentler, sumerian, goddess, of, love, and, fecundity, she, likens, inanna, to, a, great, storm, bird, who, swoops, down, on, the, lesser, gods, and, sends, them, fluttering, off, like, surprised, bats, then, in, probably, the, most, interesting, part, of, the, hymn, enheduanna, herself, steps, forward, in, the, first, person, to, recite, her, own, past, glories, establishing, her, credibility, and, explaining, her, present, plight, she, has, been, banished, as, high, priestess, from, the, temple, in, the, city, of, ur, and, from, uruk, and, exiled, to, the, steppe, she, begs, the, moon, god, nanna, to, intercede, for, her, because, the, city, of, uruk, under, the, ruler, lugalanne, has, rebelled, against, sargon, the, rebel, lugalanne, has, even, destroyed, the, temple, eanna, one, of, the, greatest, temples, in, the, ancient, world, and, then, made, advances, on, his, sister, in, law, the,
