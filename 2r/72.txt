fertile, crescent, europe, africa, siberia, behavioral, modernity, is, a, suite, of, behavioral, and, cognitive, traits, believed, to, distinguish, current, homo, sapiens, from, other, anatomically, modern, humans, hominins, and, primates, most, scholars, agree, that, modern, human, behavior, can, be, characterized, by, abstract, thinking, planning, depth, symbolic, behavior, e, g, art, ornamentation, music, and, dance, exploitation, of, large, game, and, blade, technology, among, others, underlying, these, behaviors, and, technological, innovations, are, cognitive, and, cultural, foundations, that, have, been, documented, experimentally, and, ethnographically, by, evolutionary, and, cultural, anthropologists, these, human, universal, patterns, include, cumulative, cultural, adaptation, social, norms, language, and, extensive, help, and, cooperation, beyond, close, kin, within, the, tradition, of, evolutionary, anthropology, and, related, disciplines, it, has, been, argued, that, the, development, of, these, modern, behavioral, traits, in, combination, with, the, climatic, conditions, of, the, last, glacial, period, and, last, glacial, maximum, causing, population, bottlenecks, contributed, to, the, evolutionary, success, of, homo, sapiens, worldwide, relative, to, neanderthals, denisovans, and, other, archaic, humans, debate, continues, as, to, whether, anatomically, modern, humans, were, behaviorally, modern, as, well, there, are, many, theories, on, the, evolution, of, behavioral, modernity, these, approaches, tend, to, fall, into, two, camps, cognitive, and, gradualist, the, later, upper, paleolithic, model, theorizes, that, modern, human, behavior, arose, through, cognitive, genetic, changes, in, africa, abruptly, around, 40, 000, 50, 000, years, ago, around, the, time, of, the, out, of, africa, migration, prompting, the, movement, of, some, modern, humans, out, of, africa, and, across, the, world, other, models, focus, on, how, modern, human, behavior, may, have, arisen, through, gradual, steps, with, the, archaeological, signatures, of, such, behavior, appearing, only, through, demographic, or, subsistence, based, changes, many, cite, evidence, of, behavioral, modernity, earlier, by, at, least, about, 150, 000, 75, 000, years, ago, and, possibly, earlier, namely, in, the, african, middle, stone, age, anthropologists, sally, mcbrearty, and, alison, s, brooks, have, been, notable, proponents, of, gradualism, challenging, europe, centered, models, by, situating, more, change, in, the, african, middle, stone, age, though, this, model, is, more, difficult, to, substantiate, due, to, the, general, thinning, of, the, fossil, record, as, one, goes, further, back, in, time, to, classify, what, should, be, included, in, modern, human, behavior, it, is, necessary, to, define, behaviors, that, are, universal, among, living, human, groups, some, examples, of, these, human, universals, are, abstract, thought, planning, trade, cooperative, labor, body, decoration, and, the, control, and, use, of, fire, along, with, these, traits, humans, possess, much, reliance, on, social, learning, this, cumulative, cultural, change, or, cultural, ratchet, separates, human, culture, from, social, learning, in, animals, in, addition, a, reliance, on, social, learning, may, be, responsible, in, part, for, humans, rapid, adaptation, to, many, environments, outside, of, africa, since, cultural, universals, are, found, in, all, cultures, including, isolated, indigenous, groups, these, traits, must, have, evolved, or, have, been, invented, in, africa, prior, to, the, exodus, archaeologically, a, number, of, empirical, traits, have, been, used, as, indicators, of, modern, human, behavior, while, these, are, often, debated, a, few, are, generally, agreed, upon, archaeological, evidence, of, behavioral, modernity, includes, several, critiques, have, been, placed, against, the, traditional, concept, of, behavioral, modernity, both, methodologically, and, philosophically, anthropologist, john, shea, outlines, a, variety, of, problems, with, this, concept, arguing, instead, for, behavioral, variability, which, according, to, the, author, better, describes, the, archaeological, record, the, use, of, trait, lists, according, to, shea, runs, the, risk, of, taphonomic, bias, where, some, sites, may, yield, more, artifacts, than, others, despite, similar, populations, as, well, trait, lists, can, be, ambiguous, in, how, behaviors, may, be, empirically, recognized, in, the, archaeological, record, in, particular, shea, cautions, that, population, pressure, cultural, change, or, optimality, models, like, those, in, human, behavioral, ecology, might, better, predict, changes, in, tool, types, or, subsistence, strategies, than, a, change, from, archaic, to, modern, behavior, some, researchers, argue, that, a, greater, emphasis, should, be, placed, on, identifying, only, those, artifacts, which, are, unquestionably, or, purely, symbolic, as, a, metric, for, modern, human, behavior, since, 2018, recent, dating, methods, utilized, on, various, cave, art, sites, in, spain, and, france, have, shown, that, neanderthals, performed, symbolic, artistic, expression, consisting, of, red, lines, dots, and, hand, stencils, found, in, caves, prior, to, contact, with, anatomically, modern, humans, this, is, contrary, to, previous, suggestions, that, neanderthals, lacked, these, capabilities, the, late, upper, paleolithic, model, or, upper, paleolithic, revolution, refers, to, the, idea, that, though, anatomically, modern, humans, first, appear, around, 150, 000, years, ago, as, was, once, believed, they, were, not, cognitively, or, behaviorally, modern, until, around, 50, 000, years, ago, leading, to, their, expansion, out, of, africa, and, into, europe, and, asia, these, authors, note, that, traits, used, as, a, metric, for, behavioral, modernity, do, not, appear, as, a, package, until, around, 40, 50, 000, years, ago, anthropologist, richard, klein, specifically, describes, that, evidence, of, fishing, tools, made, from, bone, hearths, significant, artifact, diversity, and, elaborate, graves, are, all, absent, before, this, point, according, to, both, shea, and, klein, art, only, becomes, common, beyond, this, switching, point, signifying, a, change, from, archaic, to, modern, humans, most, researchers, argue, that, a, neurological, or, genetic, change, perhaps, one, enabling, complex, language, such, as, foxp2, caused, this, revolutionary, change, in, humans, the, role, of, foxp2, as, a, driver, of, evolutionary, selection, has, been, called, into, question, following, recent, research, results, building, on, the, foxp2, gene, hypothesis, cognitive, scientist, philip, lieberman, has, argued, that, proto, language, behaviour, existed, prior, to, 50, 000, bp, albeit, in, a, more, primitive, form, lieberman, has, advanced, fossil, evidence, such, as, neck, and, throat, dimensions, to, demonstrate, that, so, called, anatomically, modern, humans, from, 100, 000, bp, continued, to, evolve, their, svt, supralaryngeal, vocal, tract, which, already, possessed, a, horizontal, portion, svth, capable, of, producing, many, phonemes, which, were, mostly, consonants, according, to, his, theory, neanderthals, and, early, homo, sapiens, would, have, been, able, to, communicate, using, sounds, and, gestures, from, 100, 000, bp, homo, sapiens, necks, continued, to, lengthen, to, a, point, by, around, 50, 000, bp, where, homo, sapiens, necks, were, long, enough, to, accommodate, a, vertical, portion, to, their, svt, svtv, which, is, now, a, universal, trait, among, humans, this, svtv, enabled, the, enunciation, of, quantal, vowels, and, these, quantal, vowels, could, then, be, immediately, put, to, use, by, the, already, sophisticated, neuro, motor, control, features, of, the, foxp2, gene, to, generate, more, nuanced, sounds, and, in, effect, increase, by, orders, of, magnitude, the, number, of, distinct, sounds, that, can, be, produced, allowing, for, fully, symbolic, language, goody, 1986, draws, an, analogy, between, the, development, of, spoken, language, and, that, of, writing, the, shift, from, pictographic, or, ideographic, symbols, into, a, fully, abstract, logographic, writing, system, such, as, hieroglyphics, or, from, a, logoprahic, system, into, an, abjad, or, alphabet, led, to, dramatic, changes, in, human, civilization, contrasted, with, this, view, of, a, spontaneous, leap, in, cognition, among, ancient, humans, some, anthropologists, like, alison, s, brooks, primarily, working, in, african, archaeology, point, to, the, gradual, accumulation, of, modern, behaviors, starting, well, before, the, 50, 000, year, benchmark, of, the, upper, paleolithic, revolution, models, howiesons, poort, blombos, and, other, south, african, archaeological, sites, for, example, show, evidence, of, marine, resource, acquisition, trade, the, making, of, bone, tools, blade, and, microlithic, technology, and, abstract, ornamentation, at, least, by, 80, 000, years, ago, given, evidence, from, africa, and, the, middle, east, a, variety, of, hypotheses, have, been, put, forth, to, describe, an, earlier, gradual, transition, from, simple, to, more, complex, human, behavior, some, authors, have, pushed, back, the, appearance, of, fully, modern, behavior, to, around, 80, 000, years, ago, or, earlier, in, order, to, incorporate, the, south, african, data, others, focus, on, the, slow, accumulation, of, different, technologies, and, behaviors, across, time, these, researchers, describe, how, anatomically, modern, humans, could, have, been, cognitively, the, same, and, what, we, define, as, behavioral, modernity, is, just, the, result, of, thousands, of, years, of, cultural, adaptation, and, learning, archaeologist, francesco, d, errico, and, others, have, looked, at, neanderthal, culture, rather, than, early, human, behavior, exclusively, for, clues, into, behavioral, modernity, noting, that, neanderthal, assemblages, often, portray, traits, similar, to, those, listed, for, modern, human, behavior, researchers, stress, that, the, foundations, for, behavioral, modernity, may, in, fact, lie, deeper, in, our, hominin, ancestors, if, both, modern, humans, and, neanderthals, express, abstract, art, and, complex, tools, then, modern, human, behavior, cannot, be, a, derived, trait, for, our, species, they, argue, that, the, original, human, revolution, theory, reflects, a, profound, eurocentric, bias, recent, archaeological, evidence, they, argue, proves, that, humans, evolving, in, africa, some, 300, 000, or, even, 400, 000, years, ago, were, already, becoming, cognitively, and, behaviourally, modern, these, features, include, blade, and, microlithic, technology, bone, tools, increased, geographic, range, specialized, hunting, the, use, of, aquatic, resources, long, distance, trade, systematic, processing, and, use, of, pigment, and, art, and, decoration, these, items, do, not, occur, suddenly, together, as, predicted, by, the, human, revolution, model, but, at, sites, that, are, widely, separated, in, space, and, time, this, suggests, a, gradual, assembling, of, the, package, of, modern, human, behaviours, in, africa, and, its, later, export, to, other, regions, of, the, old, world, between, these, extremes, is, the, view, currently, supported, by, archaeologists, chris, henshilwood, curtis, marean, ian, watts, and, others, that, there, was, indeed, some, kind, of, human, revolution, but, that, it, occurred, in, africa, and, spanned, tens, of, thousands, of, years, the, term, revolution, in, this, context, would, mean, not, a, sudden, mutation, but, a, historical, development, along, the, lines, of, the, industrial, revolution, or, the, neolithic, revolution, in, other, words, it, was, a, relatively, accelerated, process, too, rapid, for, ordinary, darwinian, descent, with, modification, yet, too, gradual, to, be, attributed, to, a, single, genetic, or, other, sudden, event, these, archaeologists, point, in, particular, to, the, relatively, explosive, emergence, of, ochre, crayons, and, shell, necklaces, apparently, used, for, cosmetic, purposes, these, archaeologists, see, symbolic, organisation, of, human, social, life, as, the, key, transition, in, modern, human, evolution, recently, discovered, at, sites, such, as, blombos, cave, and, pinnacle, point, south, africa, pierced, shells, pigments, and, other, striking, signs, of, personal, ornamentation, have, been, dated, within, a, time, window, of, 70, 000, 160, 000, years, ago, in, the, african, middle, stone, age, suggesting, that, the, emergence, of, homo, sapiens, coincided, after, all, with, the, transition, to, modern, cognition, and, behaviour, while, viewing, the, emergence, of, language, as, a, revolutionary, development, this, school, of, thought, generally, attributes, it, to, cumulative, social, cognitive, and, cultural, evolutionary, processes, as, opposed, to, a, single, genetic, mutation, a, further, view, taken, by, archaeologists, such, as, francesco, d, errico, and, jo, o, zilh, o, is, a, multi, species, perspective, arguing, that, evidence, for, symbolic, culture, in, the, form, of, utilised, pigments, and, pierced, shells, are, also, found, in, neanderthal, sites, independently, of, any, modern, human, influence, cultural, evolutionary, models, may, also, shed, light, on, why, although, evidence, of, behavioral, modernity, exists, before, 50, 000, years, ago, it, is, not, expressed, consistently, until, that, point, with, small, population, sizes, human, groups, would, have, been, affected, by, demographic, and, cultural, evolutionary, forces, that, may, not, have, allowed, for, complex, cultural, traits, according, to, some, authors, until, population, density, became, significantly, high, complex, traits, could, not, have, been, maintained, effectively, some, genetic, evidence, supports, a, dramatic, increase, in, population, size, before, human, migration, out, of, africa, high, local, extinction, rates, within, a, population, also, can, significantly, decrease, the, amount, of, diversity, in, neutral, cultural, traits, regardless, of, cognitive, ability, research, from, 2017, indicates, that, homo, sapiens, originated, in, africa, between, around, 350, 000, and, 260, 000, years, ago, there, is, some, evidence, for, the, beginning, of, modern, behavior, among, early, african, h, sapiens, around, that, period, before, the, out, of, africa, theory, was, generally, accepted, there, was, no, consensus, on, where, the, human, species, evolved, and, consequently, where, modern, human, behavior, arose, now, however, african, archaeology, has, become, extremely, important, in, discovering, the, origins, of, humanity, the, first, cro, magnon, expansion, into, europe, around, 48, 000, years, ago, is, generally, accepted, as, already, modern, and, it, is, now, generally, believed, that, behavioral, modernity, appeared, in, africa, before, 50, 000, years, ago, either, significantly, earlier, or, possibly, as, a, late, upper, paleolithic, revolution, soon, before, which, prompted, migration, out, of, africa, a, variety, of, evidence, of, abstract, imagery, widened, subsistence, strategies, and, other, modern, behaviors, have, been, discovered, in, africa, especially, south, north, and, east, africa, the, blombos, cave, site, in, south, africa, for, example, is, famous, for, rectangular, slabs, of, ochre, engraved, with, geometric, designs, using, multiple, dating, techniques, the, site, was, dated, to, be, around, 77, 000, and, 100, 000, to, 75, 000, years, old, ostrich, egg, shell, containers, engraved, with, geometric, designs, dating, to, 60, 000, years, ago, were, found, at, diepkloof, south, africa, beads, and, other, personal, ornamentation, have, been, found, from, morocco, which, might, be, as, much, as, 130, 000, years, old, as, well, the, cave, of, hearths, in, south, africa, has, yielded, a, number, of, beads, dating, from, significantly, prior, to, 50, 000, years, ago, and, shell, beads, dating, to, about, 75, 000, years, ago, have, been, found, at, blombos, cave, south, africa, specialized, projectile, weapons, as, well, have, been, found, at, various, sites, in, middle, stone, age, africa, including, bone, and, stone, arrowheads, at, south, african, sites, such, as, sibudu, cave, along, with, an, early, bone, needle, also, found, at, sibudu, dating, approximately, 72, 000, 60, 000, years, ago, on, some, of, which, poisons, may, have, been, used, and, bone, harpoons, at, the, central, african, site, of, katanda, dating, to, about, 90, 000, years, ago, evidence, also, exists, for, the, systematic, heat, treating, of, silcrete, stone, to, increase, its, flake, ability, for, the, purpose, of, toolmaking, beginning, approximately, 164, 000, years, ago, at, the, south, african, site, of, pinnacle, point, and, becoming, common, there, for, the, creation, of, microlithic, tools, at, about, 72, 000, years, ago, in, 2008, an, ochre, processing, workshop, likely, for, the, production, of, paints, was, uncovered, dating, to, c, 100, 000, years, ago, at, blombos, cave, south, africa, analysis, shows, that, a, liquefied, pigment, rich, mixture, was, produced, and, stored, in, the, two, abalone, shells, and, that, ochre, bone, charcoal, grindstones, and, hammer, stones, also, formed, a, composite, part, of, the, toolkits, evidence, for, the, complexity, of, the, task, includes, procuring, and, combining, raw, materials, from, various, sources, implying, they, had, a, mental, template, of, the, process, they, would, follow, possibly, using, pyrotechnology, to, facilitate, fat, extraction, from, bone, using, a, probable, recipe, to, produce, the, compound, and, the, use, of, shell, containers, for, mixing, and, storage, for, later, use, modern, behaviors, such, as, the, making, of, shell, beads, bone, tools, and, arrows, and, the, use, of, ochre, pigment, are, evident, at, a, kenyan, site, by, 78, 000, 67, 000, years, ago, evidence, of, early, stone, tipped, projectile, weapons, a, characteristic, tool, of, homo, sapiens, the, stone, tips, of, javelins, or, throwing, spears, were, discovered, in, 2013, at, the, ethiopian, site, of, gademotta, and, date, to, around, 279, 000, years, ago, expanding, subsistence, strategies, beyond, big, game, hunting, and, the, consequential, diversity, in, tool, types, has, been, noted, as, signs, of, behavioral, modernity, a, number, of, south, african, sites, have, shown, an, early, reliance, on, aquatic, resources, from, fish, to, shellfish, pinnacle, point, in, particular, shows, exploitation, of, marine, resources, as, early, as, 120, 000, years, ago, perhaps, in, response, to, more, arid, conditions, inland, establishing, a, reliance, on, predictable, shellfish, deposits, for, example, could, reduce, mobility, and, facilitate, complex, social, systems, and, symbolic, behavior, blombos, cave, and, site, 440, in, sudan, both, show, evidence, of, fishing, as, well, taphonomic, change, in, fish, skeletons, from, blombos, cave, have, been, interpreted, as, capture, of, live, fish, clearly, an, intentional, human, behavior, humans, in, north, africa, nazlet, sabaha, egypt, are, known, to, have, dabbled, in, chert, mining, as, early, as, 100, 000, years, ago, for, the, construction, of, stone, tools, evidence, was, found, in, 2018, dating, to, about, 320, 000, years, ago, at, the, kenyan, site, of, olorgesailie, of, the, early, emergence, of, modern, behaviors, including, long, distance, trade, networks, involving, goods, such, as, obsidian, the, use, of, pigments, and, the, possible, making, of, projectile, points, it, is, observed, by, the, authors, of, three, 2018, studies, on, the, site, that, the, evidence, of, these, behaviors, is, approximately, contemporary, to, the, earliest, known, homo, sapiens, fossil, remains, from, africa, such, as, at, jebel, irhoud, and, florisbad, and, they, suggest, that, complex, and, modern, behaviors, had, already, begun, in, africa, around, the, time, of, the, emergence, of, anatomically, modern, homo, sapiens, in, 2019, further, evidence, of, early, complex, projectile, weapons, in, africa, was, found, at, aduma, ethiopia, dated, 100, 000, 80, 000, years, ago, in, the, form, of, points, considered, likely, to, belong, to, darts, delivered, by, spear, throwers, olduvai, hominid, 1, wore, facial, piercings, while, traditionally, described, as, evidence, for, the, later, upper, paleolithic, model, european, archaeology, has, shown, that, the, issue, is, more, complex, a, variety, of, stone, tool, technologies, are, present, at, the, time, of, human, expansion, into, europe, and, show, evidence, of, modern, behavior, despite, the, problems, of, conflating, specific, tools, with, cultural, groups, the, aurignacian, tool, complex, for, example, is, generally, taken, as, a, purely, modern, human, signature, the, discovery, of, transitional, complexes, like, proto, aurignacian, have, been, taken, as, evidence, of, human, groups, progressing, through, steps, of, innovation, if, as, this, might, suggest, human, groups, were, already, migrating, into, eastern, europe, around, 40, 000, years, and, only, afterward, show, evidence, of, behavioral, modernity, then, either, the, cognitive, change, must, have, diffused, back, into, africa, or, was, already, present, before, migration, in, light, of, a, growing, body, of, evidence, of, neanderthal, culture, and, tool, complexes, some, researchers, have, put, forth, a, multiple, species, model, for, behavioral, modernity, neanderthals, were, often, cited, as, being, an, evolutionary, dead, end, apish, cousins, who, were, less, advanced, than, their, human, contemporaries, personal, ornaments, were, relegated, as, trinkets, or, poor, imitations, compared, to, the, cave, art, produced, by, h, sapiens, despite, this, european, evidence, has, shown, a, variety, of, personal, ornaments, and, artistic, artifacts, produced, by, neanderthals, for, example, the, neanderthal, site, of, grotte, du, renne, has, produced, grooved, bear, wolf, and, fox, incisors, ochre, and, other, symbolic, artifacts, although, few, and, controversial, circumstantial, evidence, of, neanderthal, ritual, burials, has, been, uncovered, there, are, two, options, to, describe, this, symbolic, behavior, among, neanderthals, they, copied, cultural, traits, from, arriving, modern, humans, or, they, had, their, own, cultural, traditions, comparative, with, behavioral, modernity, if, they, just, copied, cultural, traditions, which, is, debated, by, several, authors, they, still, possessed, the, capacity, for, complex, culture, described, by, behavioral, modernity, as, discussed, above, if, neanderthals, also, were, behaviorally, modern, then, it, cannot, be, a, species, specific, derived, trait, most, debates, surrounding, behavioral, modernity, have, been, focused, on, africa, or, europe, but, an, increasing, amount, of, focus, has, been, placed, on, east, asia, this, region, offers, a, unique, opportunity, to, test, hypotheses, of, multi, regionalism, replacement, and, demographic, effects, unlike, europe, where, initial, migration, occurred, around, 50, 000, years, ago, human, remains, have, been, dated, in, china, to, around, 100, 000, years, ago, this, early, evidence, of, human, expansion, calls, into, question, behavioral, modernity, as, an, impetus, for, migration, stone, tool, technology, is, particularly, of, interest, in, east, asia, following, homo, erectus, migrations, out, of, africa, acheulean, technology, never, seems, to, appear, beyond, present, day, india, and, into, china, analogously, mode, 3, or, levallois, technology, is, not, apparent, in, china, following, later, hominin, dispersals, this, lack, of, more, advanced, technology, has, been, explained, by, serial, founder, effects, and, low, population, densities, out, of, africa, although, tool, complexes, comparative, to, europe, are, missing, or, fragmentary, other, archaeological, evidence, shows, behavioral, modernity, for, example, the, peopling, of, the, japanese, archipelago, offers, an, opportunity, to, investigate, the, early, use, of, watercraft, although, one, site, kanedori, in, honshu, does, suggest, the, use, of, watercraft, as, early, as, 84, 000, years, ago, there, is, no, other, evidence, of, hominins, in, japan, until, 50, 000, years, ago, the, zhoukoudian, cave, system, near, beijing, has, been, excavated, since, the, 1930s, and, has, yielded, precious, data, on, early, human, behavior, in, east, asia, although, disputed, there, is, evidence, of, possible, human, burials, and, interred, remains, in, the, cave, dated, to, around, 34, 20, 000, years, ago, these, remains, have, associated, personal, ornaments, in, the, form, of, beads, and, worked, shell, suggesting, symbolic, behavior, along, with, possible, burials, numerous, other, symbolic, objects, like, punctured, animal, teeth, and, beads, some, dyed, in, red, ochre, have, all, been, found, at, zhoukoudian, although, fragmentary, the, archaeological, record, of, eastern, asia, shows, evidence, of, behavioral, modernity, before, 50, 000, years, ago, but, like, the, african, record, it, is, not, fully, apparent, until, that, time
