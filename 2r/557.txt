the, per, capita, income, of, the, hungarian, people, yet, their, standard, of, living, diminished, because, of, the, compulsory, financial, contributions, towards, the, industrialisation, of, hungary, which, reduced, the, disposable, and, discretionary, income, of, individual, hungarian, workers, that, poor, economy, was, further, diminished, by, the, bureaucratic, mismanagement, of, resources, which, caused, shortages, of, supplies, and, the, consequent, rationing, of, bread, and, sugar, flour, and, meat, et, cetera, the, net, result, of, those, economic, conditions, was, that,

economic, assistance, comecon, prevented, direct, trade, with, the, countries, of, the, west, and, also, prevented, the, hungarian, people, s, republic, from, receiving, american, financial, aid, through, the, marshall, plan, 1948, socially, the, imposition, of, soviet, style, economic, policies, and, the, payment, of, war, reparations, angered, the, peoples, of, hungary, whilst, the, cumulative, effects, of, economic, austerity, fuelled, anti, soviet, political, discontent, as, the, payment, of, foreign, debt, took, precedence, over, the, material, needs, of, the, hungarian, people, on, 5, march, 1953, the, death, of, stalin, allowed, the, communist, party, of, the, soviet, union, cpsu, to, proceed, with, the, de, stalinization, of, the, ussr, which, was, a, relative, liberalization, of, politics, that, afterward, allowed, most, european, communist, parties, and, the, communist, parties, of, the, warsaw, pact, to, develop, a, reformist, wing, within, the, structures, of, the, philosophy, of, marxism, and, orders, from, moscow, hence, the, reformist, communist, imre, nagy, became, prime, minister, 1953, 55, of, the, hungarian, people, s, republic, in, replacement, of, the, stalinist, m, ty, s, r, kosi, 1946, 56, whose, heavy, hand, style, of, communist, government, had, proved, counter, productive, to, the, interests, of, the, ussr, in, hungary, despite, not, being, prime, minister, of, hungary, r, kosi, remained, politically, powerful, as, the, general, secretary, of, the, hungarian, communist, party, and, so, undermined, many, of, the,

without, decisive, result, because, despite, the, protocol, of, s, vres, 22, 24, october, 1956, the, anglo, french, intervention, to, egyptian, politics, the, suez, crisis, caused, by, britain, and, france, seizing, the, egyptian, suez, canal, prevented, the, west, from, criticizing, the, imperialism, of, the, ussr, the, u, s, vice, president, richard, nixon, said, that, we, couldn, t, on, one, hand, complain, about, the, soviets, intervening, in, hungary, and, on, the, other, hand, approve, of, the, british, and, the, french, picking, that, particular, time, to, intervene, against, nasser, despite, earlier, demands, for, the, rollback, of, communism, and, of, the, leftist, liberation, of, eastern, europe, dulles, told, the, ussr, that, we, do, not, see, these, states, as, potential, military, allies, on, 4, november, 1956, the, ussr, vetoed, the, security, council, s, resolution, criticising, the, ussr, s, invasion, of, hungary, in, its, stead, united, nations, security, council, resolution, 120, was, passed, which, charged, the, general, assembly, to, meet, to, discuss, the, matter, despite, 50, votes, for, withdrawal, 8, votes, against, withdrawal, and, 15, abstentions, from, the, matter, the, communist, k, d, r, government, of, hungary, rejected, the, presence, of, un, observers, in, the, hungarian, people, s, republic, in, the, u, s, two, facts, determined, the, inaction, of, the, eisenhower, government, i, the, u, s, army, study, hungary, resistance, activities, and, potentials, january, 1956, which, recommended, against, u, s, military, intervention, to, hungary, on, the, side, of, the, hungarian, revolutionists, and, ii, the, secret, warfare, of, the, national, security, council, that, encouraged, anti, communist, political, discontent, in, the, eastern, bloc, only, through, psychological, warfare, sabotage, and, economic, warfare, according, to, a, ross, johnson, in, the, international, journal, of, intelligence, and, counterintelligence, contrary, to, allegations, that, continue, to, this, day, rfe, hungarian, broadcasts, did, not, foment, revolution, urge, hungarians, to, fight, the, soviets, or, promise, western, assistance, they, did, criticize, would, be, reform, leader, imre, nagy, in, personally, vituperative, terms, and, contained, emotional, bombast, that, hungarian, listeners, could, easily, have, interpreted, as, indicating, western, solidarity, and, support, after, the, ussr, defeated, the, anti, communist, hungarian, revolution, the, revolutionists, criticised, the, cia, and, its, rfe, network, for, having, deceived, the, hungarians, into, believing, that, the, west, nato, and, the, us, would, expel, the, ussr, from, the, hungarian, people, s, republic, although, incitements, to, violence, were, officially, against, rfe, policy, an, internal, analysis, by, rfe, adviser, william, griffith, found, as, summarized, by, the, national, security, archive, at, george, washington, university, that, rfe, broadcasts, in, several, cases, had, implied, that, foreign, aid, would, be, forthcoming, if, the, hungarians, succeeded, in, establishing, a, central, military, command, and, appealed, to, the, hungarians, to, continue, to, fight, vigorously, griffith, himself, wrote, that, there, were, relatively, few, real, policy, violations, specifically, four, out, of, more, than, 300, broadcasts, under, review, but, conceded, that, summaries, often, failed, to, reflect, the, content, of, the, program, as, it, was, finally, written, this, is, not, the, case, only, with, programs, where, policy, violation, occurred, the, summaries, during, the, period, under, review, in, many, other, cases, proved, to, be, very, inaccurate, descriptions, of, the, programs, finally, produced, l, szl, borhi, writing, in, the, journal, of, cold, war, studies, states, that, the, rfe, broadcasts, sanctioned, by, cia, official, cord, meyer, were, often, incautious, even, reckless, and, undermined, parallel, efforts, by, the, eisenhower, administration, to, negotiate, hungarian, independence, in, a, framework, similar, to, finlandization, these, contradictory, policies, sabotaged, the, overall, approach, the, harder, the, insurgents, fought, the, less, chance, there, was, for, a, negotiated, settlement, but, the, unwillingness, of, the, united, states, to, counter, soviet, military, action, meant, that, the, hungarian, quest, for, liberation, was, suicidal, in, 1998, the, hungarian, ambassador, g, za, jeszenszky, criticised, western, inaction, in, 1956, as, disingenuous, recalling, that, the, political, influence, of, the, united, nations, readily, applied, to, resolving, the, korean, war, 1950, 1953, moreover, the, study, hungary, 1956, reviving, the, debate, over, u, s, in, action, during, the, revolution, confirms, that, the, eisenhower, government, did, not, intervene, to, the, hungarian, revolution, which, occurred, in, the, soviet, sphere, of, influence, because, the, ussr, would, have, responded, with, a, nuclear, war, on, 1, november, imre, nagy, received, reports, that, soviet, forces, had, entered, hungary, from, the, east, and, were, moving, towards, budapest, nagy,
