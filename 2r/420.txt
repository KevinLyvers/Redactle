enclosure, or, inclosure, is, a, term, used, in, english, landownership, that, refers, to, the, appropriation, of, waste, or, common, land, enclosing, it, and, by, doing, so, depriving, commoners, of, their, rights, of, access, and, privilege, agreements, to, enclose, land, could, be, either, through, a, formal, or, informal, process, the, process, could, normally, be, accomplished, in, three, ways, first, there, was, the, creation, of, closes, taken, out, of, larger, common, fields, by, their, owners, secondly, there, was, enclosure, by, proprietors, owners, who, acted, together, usually, small, farmers, or, squires, leading, to, the, enclosure, of, whole, parishes, finally, there, were, enclosures, by, acts, of, parliament, the, primary, reason, for, enclosure, was, to, improve, the, efficiency, of, agriculture, however, there, were, other, motives, too, one, example, being, that, the, value, of, the, land, enclosed, would, be, substantially, increased, there, were, social, consequences, to, the, policy, with, many, protests, at, the, removal, of, rights, from, the, common, people, enclosure, riots, are, seen, by, historians, as, the, pre, eminent, form, of, social, protest, from, the, 1530s, to, 1640s, after, william, i, invaded, and, conquered, england, in, 1066, he, distributed, its, land, amongst, 180, barons, who, held, it, as, his, tenants, in, chief, establishing, a, feudal, system, however, he, promised, the, english, people, that, he, would, keep, the, laws, of, edward, the, confessor, thus, commoners, were, still, able, to, exercise, their, ancient, customary, rights, the, original, contract, bound, the, people, who, occupied, the, land, to, provide, some, form, of, service, this, later, evolved, into, a, financial, agreement, that, avoided, or, replaced, the, service, following, the, introduction, of, the, feudal, system, there, was, an, increase, in, the, economic, growth, and, urban, expansion, of, the, country, in, the, 13th, century, successful, lords, did, very, well, financially, while, the, peasants, faced, with, ever, increasing, costs, did, not, and, their, landholding, dwindled, after, outbreaks, of, the, black, death, in, the, middle, of, the, 14th, century, however, there, was, a, major, decline, in, population, and, crop, yields, the, decline, in, population, left, the, surviving, farm, workers, in, great, demand, landowners, faced, the, choice, of, raising, wages, to, compete, for, workers, or, letting, their, lands, go, unused, wages, for, labourers, rose, and, translated, into, inflation, across, the, economy, the, ensuing, difficulties, in, hiring, labour, has, been, seen, as, causing, the, abandonment, of, land, and, the, demise, of, the, feudal, system, although, some, historians, have, suggested, that, the, effects, of, the, black, death, may, have, only, sped, up, an, already, on, going, process, from, as, early, as, the, 12th, century, agricultural, land, had, been, enclosed, however, the, history, of, enclosure, in, england, is, different, from, region, to, region, parts, of, south, east, england, notably, sections, of, essex, and, kent, retained, the, pre, roman, celtic, field, system, of, farming, in, small, enclosed, fields, similarly, in, much, of, west, and, north, west, england, fields, were, either, never, open, or, were, enclosed, early, the, primary, area, of, field, management, known, as, the, open, field, system, was, in, the, lowland, areas, of, england, in, a, broad, band, from, yorkshire, and, lincolnshire, diagonally, across, england, to, the, south, taking, in, parts, of, norfolk, and, suffolk, cambridgeshire, large, areas, of, the, midlands, and, most, of, south, central, england, enclosure, inclosure, villagers, there, were, essentially, two, broad, categories, of, enclosure, these, were, formal, or, informal, agreements, formal, enclosure, was, achieved, either, through, act, of, parliament, or, from, 1836, onwards, by, a, written, agreement, signed, by, all, parties, involved, the, written, record, would, probably, also, include, a, map, with, informal, agreements, there, was, either, minimal, or, no, written, record, other, than, occasionally, a, map, of, the, agreement, the, most, straightforward, informal, enclosure, was, through, unity, of, possession, under, this, if, an, individual, managed, to, acquire, all, the, disparate, strips, of, land, in, an, area, and, consolidate, them, in, one, whole, piece, for, example, a, manor, then, any, communal, rights, would, cease, to, exist, since, there, was, no, one, to, exercise, them, before, the, enclosures, in, england, common, land, was, under, the, control, of, the, manorial, lord, the, usual, manor, consisted, of, two, elements, the, peasant, tenantry, and, the, lord, s, holding, known, as, the, demesne, farm, the, land, the, lord, held, was, for, his, benefit, and, was, farmed, by, his, own, direct, employees, or, by, hired, labour, the, tenant, farmers, had, to, pay, rent, this, could, either, be, cash, labour, or, produce, tenants, had, certain, rights, such, as, pasture, pannage, or, estovers, that, could, be, held, by, neighbouring, properties, or, occasionally, in, gross, by, all, manorial, tenants, waste, land, was, often, very, narrow, areas, typically, less, than, 1, yard, 0, 91, m, wide, in, awkward, locations, such, as, cliff, edges, or, inconveniently, shaped, manorial, borders, but, also, could, be, bare, rock, it, was, not, officially, used, by, anyone, and, so, was, often, farmed, by, landless, peasants, the, remaining, land, was, organised, into, a, large, number, of, narrow, strips, each, tenant, possessing, several, disparate, strips, throughout, the, manor, as, would, the, manorial, lord, the, open, field, system, was, administered, by, manorial, courts, which, exercised, some, collective, control, the, land, in, a, manor, under, this, system, would, consist, of, what, might, now, be, termed, a, single, field, would, have, been, divided, under, this, system, among, the, lord, and, his, tenants, poorer, peasants, serfs, or, copyholders, depending, on, the, era, were, allowed, to, live, on, the, strips, owned, by, the, lord, in, return, for, cultivating, his, land, the, open, field, system, was, probably, a, development, of, the, earlier, celtic, field, system, which, it, replaced, the, open, field, system, used, a, three, field, crop, rotation, system, barley, oats, or, legumes, would, be, planted, in, one, field, in, spring, wheat, or, rye, in, the, second, field, in, the, autumn, there, was, no, such, thing, as, artificial, fertilizer, in, mediaeval, england, so, the, continual, use, of, arable, land, for, crops, would, exhaust, the, fertility, of, the, soil, the, open, field, system, solved, that, problem, it, did, this, by, allowing, the, third, field, of, the, arable, land, to, be, uncultivated, each, year, and, use, that, fallow, field, for, grazing, animals, on, the, stubble, of, the, old, crop, the, manure, the, animals, produced, in, the, fallow, field, would, help, restore, its, fertility, the, following, year, the, fields, for, planting, and, fallow, would, be, rotated, the, very, nature, of, the, three, field, rotation, system, imposed, a, discipline, on, lord, and, tenants, in, their, management, of, the, arable, land, every, one, had, the, freedom, to, do, what, they, liked, with, their, own, land, but, had, to, follow, the, rhythms, of, the, rotation, system, the, land, holding, tenants, had, livestock, including, sheep, pigs, cattle, horses, oxen, and, poultry, and, after, harvest, the, fields, became, common, so, they, could, graze, animals, on, that, land, there, are, still, examples, of, villages, that, use, the, open, field, system, one, example, being, laxton, nottinghamshire, seeking, better, financial, returns, landowners, looked, for, more, efficient, farming, techniques, they, saw, enclosure, as, a, way, to, improve, efficiency, however, it, was, not, simply, the, fencing, of, existing, holdings, there, was, also, a, fundamental, change, in, agricultural, practice, one, of, the, most, important, innovations, was, the, development, of, the, norfolk, four, course, system, which, greatly, increased, crop, and, livestock, yields, by, improving, soil, fertility, and, reducing, fallow, periods, wheat, was, grown, in, the, first, year, turnips, in, the, second, followed, by, barley, with, clover, and, ryegrass, in, the, third, the, clover, and, ryegrass, were, grazed, or, cut, for, feed, in, the, fourth, year, the, turnips, were, used, for, feeding, cattle, and, sheep, in, the, winter, the, practice, of, growing, a, series, of, dissimilar, types, of, crops, in, the, same, area, in, sequential, seasons, helped, to, restore, plant, nutrients, and, reduce, the, build, up, of, pathogens, and, pests, the, system, also, improves, soil, structure, and, fertility, by, alternating, deep, rooted, and, shallow, rooted, plants, for, example, turnips, can, recover, nutrients, from, deep, under, the, soil, planting, crops, such, as, turnips, and, clover, was, not, realistic, under, the, open, field, system, because, the, unrestricted, access, to, the, field, meant, that, other, villagers, livestock, would, graze, on, the, turnips, another, important, feature, of, the, norfolk, system, was, that, it, used, labour, at, times, when, demand, was, not, at, peak, levels, from, as, early, as, the, 12th, century, some, open, fields, in, britain, were, being, enclosed, into, individually, owned, fields, after, the, statute, of, merton, in, 1235, manorial, lords, were, able, to, reorganize, strips, of, land, such, that, they, were, brought, together, in, one, contiguous, block, copyholders, had, a, customary, tenancy, on, their, piece, of, land, that, was, legally, enforceable, the, problem, was, that, a, copyhold, tenancy, was, only, valid, for, the, holder, s, life, the, heir, would, not, have, the, right, to, inheritance, although, usually, by, custom, in, exchange, for, a, fee, known, as, a, fine, the, heir, could, have, the, copyhold, transferred, to, remove, their, customary, rights, the, landlords, converted, the, copyhold, into, a, leasehold, tenancy, leasehold, removed, the, customary, rights, but, the, advantage, to, the, tenant, was, that, the, land, could, be, inherited, there, was, a, significant, rise, in, enclosure, during, the, tudor, period, enclosure, was, quite, often, undertaken, unilaterally, by, the, landowner, sometimes, illegally, the, widespread, eviction, of, people, from, their, lands, resulted, in, the, collapse, of, the, open, field, system, in, those, areas, the, deprivations, of, the, displaced, workers, has, been, seen, by, historians, as, a, cause, of, subsequent, social, unrest, in, tudor, england, the, ever, increasing, demand, for, wool, had, a, dramatic, effect, on, the, landscape, the, attraction, of, large, profits, to, be, made, from, wool, encouraged, manorial, lords, to, enclose, common, land, and, convert, it, from, arable, to, mainly, sheep, pasture, the, consequent, eviction, of, commoners, or, villagers, from, their, homes, and, loss, of, their, livelihoods, became, an, important, political, issue, for, the, tudors, the, resulting, depopulation, was, financially, disadvantageous, to, the, crown, the, authorities, were, concerned, that, many, of, the, people, subsequently, dispossessed, would, become, vagabonds, and, thieves, also, the, depopulation, of, villages, would, produce, a, weakened, workforce, and, enfeeble, the, military, strength, of, the, state, from, the, time, of, henry, vii, parliament, began, passing, acts, either, to, stop, enclosure, to, limit, its, effects, or, at, least, to, fine, those, responsible, the, so, called, tillage, acts, were, passed, between, 1489, and, 1597, the, people, who, were, responsible, for, the, enforcement, of, the, acts, were, the, same, people, who, were, actually, opposed, to, them, consequently, the, acts, were, not, strictly, enforced, ultimately, with, rising, popular, opposition, to, sheep, farming, the, tillage, act, 1533, 25, hen, 8, c, 13, restricted, the, size, of, flocks, of, sheep, to, no, more, than, 2, 400, then, the, taxation, act, 1549, 3, 4, edw, 6, c, 23, was, introduced, that, imposed, a, poll, tax, on, sheep, that, was, coupled, with, a, levy, on, home, produced, cloth, the, result, made, sheep, farming, less, profitable, however, in, the, end, it, was, market, forces, that, were, responsible, for, stopping, the, conversion, of, arable, into, pasture, an, increase, in, corn, prices, during, the, second, half, of, the, 16th, century, made, arable, farming, more, attractive, so, although, enclosures, continued, the, emphasis, was, more, on, efficient, use, of, the, arable, land, historically, the, initiative, to, enclose, land, came, either, from, a, landowner, hoping, to, maximise, rental, from, their, estate, or, a, tenant, farmer, wanting, to, improve, their, farm, before, the, 17th, century, enclosures, were, generally, by, informal, agreement, when, they, first, introduced, enclosure, by, act, of, parliament, the, informal, method, continued, too, the, first, enclosure, by, act, of, parliament, was, in, 1604, the, melcombe, regis, and, radipole, dorset, church, act, 1603, 1, jas, 1, c, 30, and, was, for, radipole, dorset, this, was, followed, by, many, more, acts, of, parliament, and, by, the, 1750s, the, parliamentary, system, became, the, more, usual, method, the, inclosure, act, 1773, 13, geo, 3, c, 81, created, a, law, that, enabled, enclosure, of, land, at, the, same, time, removing, the, right, of, commoners, access, although, there, was, usually, compensation, it, was, often, in, the, form, of, a, smaller, and, poorer, quality, plot, of, land, between, 1604, and, 1914, there, were, more, than, 5, 200, inclosure, bills, which, amounted, to, 6, 800, 000, acres, 2, 800, 000, ha, of, land, that, equated, to, approximately, one, fifth, of, the, total, area, of, england, parliamentary, inclosure, was, also, used, for, the, division, and, privatisation, of, common, wastes, such, as, fens, marshes, heathland, downland, and, moors, the, statutory, process, included, the, appointment, of, commissioners, the, process, of, enclosure, was, weighted, in, favour, of, the, tithe, owner, who, had, the, right, to, appoint, one, inclosure, commissioner, for, their, parish, tithe, owners, usually, the, anglican, clergy, could, voluntarily, commutate, tithe, payments, to, a, rental, charge, this, would, have, the, effect, of, reducing, their, income, so, many, refused, to, allow, it, however, the, tithe, act, 1836, 6, 7, will, 4, c, 71, made, it, compulsory, for, tithe, payments, to, be, commutated, to, a, rent, charge, instead, the, commissioners, of, inclosure, had, absolute, authority, to, enclose, and, redistribute, common, and, open, fields, from, around, 1745, until, the, inclosure, act, 1845, 8, 9, vict, c, 118, after, the, 1845, act, permanent, inclosure, commissioners, were, appointed, who, could, approve, enclosures, without, having, to, submit, to, parliament, the, rev, william, homer, was, a, commissioner, and, he, provided, a, job, description, in, 1766, a, commissioner, is, appointed, by, act, of, parliament, for, dividing, and, allotting, common, fields, and, is, directed, to, do, it, according, to, the, respective, interests, of, proprietors, without, undue, preference, to, any, but, paying, regard, to, situation, quality, and, convenience, the, method, of, ascertainment, is, left, to, the, major, part, of, the, commission, and, this, without, any, fetter, or, check, upon, them, beside, their, own, honour, confidence, and, late, indeed, awed, by, the, solemnity, of, an, oath, this, is, perhaps, one, of, the, greatest, trusts, ever, reposed, in, one, set, of, men, and, merits, all, the, return, of, caution, attention, and, integrity, which, can, result, from, an, honest, impartial, and, ingenuous, mind, from, william, homer, an, essay, on, the, nature, and, method, the, inclosure, of, common, fields, 1766, after, 1899, the, board, of, agriculture, which, later, became, the, ministry, of, agriculture, and, fisheries, inherited, the, powers, of, the, inclosure, commissioners, one, of, the, objectives, of, enclosure, was, to, improve, local, roads, commissioners, were, given, authorisation, to, replace, old, roads, and, country, lanes, with, new, roads, that, were, wider, and, straighter, than, those, they, replaced, the, road, system, of, england, had, been, problematic, for, some, time, an, 1852, government, report, described, the, condition, of, a, road, between, surrey, and, sussex, as, very, ruinous, and, almost, impassable, in, 1749, horace, walpole, wrote, to, a, friend, complaining, that, if, he, desired, good, roads, never, to, go, into, sussex, and, another, writer, said, that, the, sussex, road, is, an, almost, insuperable, evil, the, problem, was, that, country, lanes, were, worn, out, and, this, had, been, compounded, by, the, movement, of, cattle, thus, the, commissioners, were, given, powers, to, build, wide, straight, roads, that, would, allow, for, the, passage, of, cattle, the, completed, new, roads, would, be, subject, to, inspection, by, the, local, justices, to, make, sure, they, were, of, a, suitable, standard, in, the, late, eighteenth, century, the, width, of, the, enclosure, roads, was, at, least, 60, feet, 18, m, but, from, the, 1790s, this, was, decreased, to, 40, feet, 12, m, and, later, 30, feet, as, the, normal, maximum, width, straight, roads, of, early, origin, if, not, roman, were, probably, enclosure, roads, they, were, established, in, the, period, between, 1750, and, 1850, the, building, of, the, new, roads, especially, when, linked, up, with, new, roads, in, neighbouring, parishs, and, ultimately, the, turnpikes, was, a, permanent, improvement, to, the, road, system, of, the, country, the, social, and, economic, consequences, of, enclosure, has, been, much, discussed, by, historians, in, the, tudor, period, sir, thomas, more, in, his, utopia, said, the, increase, of, pasture, said, i, by, which, your, sheep, which, are, naturally, mild, and, easily, kept, in, order, may, be, said, now, to, devour, men, and, unpeople, not, only, villages, but, towns, for, wherever, it, is, found, that, the, sheep, of, any, soil, yield, a, softer, and, richer, wool, than, ordinary, there, the, nobility, and, gentry, and, even, those, holy, men, the, dobots, not, contented, with, the, old, rents, which, their, farms, yielded, nor, thinking, it, enough, that, they, living, at, their, ease, do, no, good, to, the, public, resolve, to, do, it, hurt, instead, of, good, they, stop, the, course, of, agriculture, destroying, houses, and, towns, reserving, only, the, churches, and, enclose, grounds, that, they, may, lodge, their, sheep, in, them, as, if, forests, and, parks, had, swallowed, up, too, little, of, the, land, those, worthy, countrymen, turn, the, best, inhabited, places, into, solitudes, for, when, an, insatiable, wretch, who, is, a, plague, to, his, country, resolves, to, enclose, many, thousand, acres, of, ground, the, owners, as, well, as, tenants, are, turned, out, of, their, possessions, by, trick, or, by, main, force, or, being, wearied, out, by, ill, usage, they, are, forced, to, sell, them, by, which, means, those, miserable, people, both, men, and, women, married, and, unmarried, old, and, young, with, their, poor, but, numerous, families, from, thomas, mores, utopia, 1518, an, anonymous, poem, known, as, the, goose, and, the, common, has, come, to, represent, the, opposition, to, the, enclosure, movement, in, the, 18th, century, the, law, locks, up, the, man, or, woman, who, steals, the, goose, from, off, the, common, but, lets, the, greater, felon, loose, who, steals, the, common, from, the, goose, part, of, 18th, century, poem, by, anon, according, to, one, academic, this, poem, is, one, of, the, pithiest, condemnations, of, the, english, enclosure, movement, the, process, of, fencing, off, common, land, and, turning, it, into, private, property, in, a, few, lines, the, poem, manages, to, criticize, double, standards, expose, the, artificial, and, controversial, nature, of, property, rights, and, take, a, slap, at, the, legitimacy, of, state, power, and, it, does, it, all, with, humor, without, jargon, and, in, rhyming, couplets, in, 1770, oliver, goldsmith, wrote, the, poem, the, deserted, village, in, it, condemns, rural, depopulation, the, enclosure, of, common, land, the, creation, of, landscape, gardens, and, the, pursuit, of, excessive, wealth, during, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, historians, generally, had, sympathy, for, the, cottagers, who, rented, their, dwellings, from, the, manorial, lord, and, also, the, landless, labourers, john, and, barbara, hammond, said, that, enclosure, was, fatal, to, three, classes, the, small, farmer, the, cottager, and, the, squatter, before, enclosure, the, cottager, was, a, labourer, with, land, after, enclosure, was, a, labourer, without, land, marxist, historians, such, as, barrington, moore, jr, focused, on, enclosure, as, a, part, of, the, class, conflict, that, eventually, eliminated, the, english, peasantry, and, saw, the, emergence, of, the, bourgeoisie, from, this, viewpoint, the, english, civil, war, provided, the, basis, for, a, major, acceleration, of, enclosures, the, parliamentary, leaders, supported, the, rights, of, landlords, vis, a, vis, the, king, whose, star, chamber, court, abolished, in, 1641, had, provided, the, primary, legal, brake, on, the, enclosure, process, by, dealing, an, ultimately, crippling, blow, to, the, monarchy, which, even, after, the, restoration, no, longer, posed, a, significant, challenge, to, enclosures, the, civil, war, paved, the, way, for, the, eventual, rise, to, power, in, the, 18th, century, of, what, has, been, called, a, committee, of, landlords, a, prelude, to, the, uk, s, parliamentary, system, after, 1650, with, the, increase, in, corn, prices, and, the, drop, in, wool, prices, the, focus, shifted, to, implementation, of, new, agricultural, techniques, including, fertilizer, new, crops, and, crop, rotation, all, of, which, greatly, increased, the, profitability, of, large, scale, farms, the, enclosure, movement, probably, peaked, from, 1760, to, 1832, by, the, latter, date, it, had, essentially, completed, the, destruction, of, the, medieval, peasant, community, surplus, peasant, labour, moved, into, the, towns, to, become, industrial, workers, the, enclosure, movement, is, considered, by, some, scholars, to, be, the, beginnings, of, the, emergence, of, capitalism, for, many, marxists, the, enclosures, constituted, primitive, accumulation, establishing, the, structural, conditions, necessary, for, a, capitalist, political, economy, in, contrast, to, the, hammonds, 1911, analysis, of, the, events, critically, j, d, chambers, and, g, e, mingay, suggested, that, the, hammonds, exaggerated, the, costs, of, change, when, in, reality, enclosure, meant, more, food, for, the, growing, population, more, land, under, cultivation, and, on, balance, more, employment, in, the, countryside, the, ability, to, enclose, land, and, raise, rents, certainly, made, the, enterprise, more, profitable, d, mccloskey, the, openfields, of, england,

between, the, middle, of, the, 18th, to, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, the, major, advantages, of, the, enclosures, were, he, writes, the, result, was, a, great, increase, in, agricultural,

causing, the, destruction, of, the, traditional, peasant, way, of, life, however, miserable, landless, peasants, could, no, longer, maintain, an, economic, independence, so, had, to, become, labourers, historians, and, economists, such, as, m, e, turner, and, d, mccloskey, have, examined, the, available, contemporary, data, and, concluded, that, the, difference, in, efficiency, between,
