the, inquisition, was, a, judicial, procedure, and, a, group, of, institutions, within, the, catholic, church, whose, aim, was, to, combat, heresy, apostasy, blasphemy, witchcraft, and, customs, considered, deviant, violence, torture, or, the, simple, threat, of, its, application, were, used, by, the, inquisition, to, extract, confessions, and, denunciations, from, heretics, studies, of, the, records, have, found, that, the, overwhelming, majority, of, sentences, consisted, of, penances, but, convictions, of, unrepentant, heresy, were, handed, over, to, the, secular, courts, which, generally, resulted, in, execution, or, life, imprisonment, the, inquisition, had, its, start, in, the, 12th, century, kingdom, of, france, with, the, aim, of, combating, religious, deviation, e, g, apostasy, or, heresy, particularly, among, the, cathars, and, the, waldensians, the, inquisitorial, courts, from, this, time, until, the, mid, 15th, century, are, together, known, as, the, medieval, inquisition, other, groups, investigated, during, the, medieval, inquisition, which, primarily, took, place, in, france, and, italy, include, the, spiritual, franciscans, the, hussites, and, the, beguines, beginning, in, the, 1250s, inquisitors, were, generally, chosen, from, members, of, the, dominican, order, replacing, the, earlier, practice, of, using, local, clergy, as, judges, during, the, late, middle, ages, and, the, early, renaissance, the, scope, of, the, inquisition, grew, significantly, in, response, to, the, protestant, reformation, and, the, catholic, counter, reformation, during, this, period, the, inquisition, conducted, by, the, holy, see, was, known, as, the, roman, inquisition, the, inquisition, also, expanded, to, other, european, countries, resulting, in, the, spanish, inquisition, and, the, portuguese, inquisition, the, spanish, and, portuguese, inquisitions, were, instead, focused, particularly, on, the, new, christians, or, conversos, as, the, former, jews, who, converted, to, christianity, to, avoid, antisemitic, regulations, and, persecution, were, called, the, anusim, people, who, were, forced, to, abandon, judaism, against, their, will, by, violence, and, threats, of, expulsion, and, on, muslim, converts, to, catholicism, the, scale, of, the, persecution, of, converted, muslims, and, converted, jews, in, spain, and, portugal, was, the, result, of, suspicions, that, they, had, secretly, reverted, to, their, previous, religions, although, both, religious, minority, groups, were, also, more, numerous, on, the, iberian, peninsula, than, in, other, parts, of, europe, as, well, as, the, fear, of, possible, rebellions, and, armed, uprisings, as, had, occurred, in, previous, times, during, this, time, spain, and, portugal, operated, inquisitorial, courts, not, only, in, europe, but, also, throughout, their, empires, in, africa, asia, and, the, americas, this, resulted, in, the, goa, inquisition, the, peruvian, inquisition, and, the, mexican, inquisition, among, others, with, the, exception, of, the, papal, states, the, institution, of, the, inquisition, was, abolished, in, the, early, 19th, century, after, the, napoleonic, wars, in, europe, and, the, spanish, american, wars, of, independence, in, the, americas, the, institution, survived, as, part, of, the, roman, curia, although, it, underwent, a, series, of, name, changes, in, 1908, it, was, renamed, the, supreme, sacred, congregation, of, the, holy, office, in, 1965, it, became, the, congregation, for, the, doctrine, of, the, faith, in, 2022, this, office, was, renamed, the, dicastery, for, the, doctrine, of, the, faith, the, term, inquisition, comes, from, the, medieval, latin, word, inquisitio, which, described, any, court, process, based, on, roman, law, which, had, gradually, come, back, into, use, during, the, late, middle, ages, today, the, english, term, inquisition, can, apply, to, any, one, of, several, institutions, that, worked, against, heretics, or, other, offenders, against, the, canon, law, of, the, catholic, church, although, the, term, inquisition, is, usually, applied, to, ecclesiastical, courts, of, the, catholic, church, it, refers, to, a, judicial, process, not, an, organization, inquisitors, were, called, such, because, they, applied, a, judicial, technique, known, as, inquisitio, which, could, be, translated, as, inquiry, or, inquest, in, this, process, which, was, already, widely, used, by, secular, rulers, henry, ii, used, it, extensively, in, england, in, the, 12th, century, an, official, inquirer, called, for, information, on, a, specific, subject, from, anyone, who, felt, he, or, she, had, something, to, offer, theoretically, the, inquisition, as, a, church, court, had, no, jurisdiction, over, muslims, and, jews, as, such, despite, several, exceptions, like, the, infamous, example, of, the, santo, ni, o, de, la, guardia, the, inquisition, was, concerned, mainly, with, the, heretical, behaviour, of, catholic, adherents, or, converts, including, forced, converts, the, overwhelming, majority, of, sentences, seem, to, have, consisted, of, penances, like, wearing, a, cross, sewn, on, one, s, clothes, or, going, on, pilgrimage, when, a, suspect, was, convicted, of, major, willful, unrepentant, heresy, canon, law, required, the, inquisitorial, tribunal, to, hand, the, person, over, to, secular, authorities, for, final, sentencing, a, secular, magistrate, the, secular, arm, would, then, determine, the, penalty, based, on, local, law, those, local, laws, included, proscriptions, against, certain, religious, crimes, and, the, punishments, included, death, by, burning, although, the, penalty, was, more, usually, banishment, or, imprisonment, for, life, which, was, generally, commuted, after, a, few, years, thus, the, inquisitors, generally, knew, the, expected, fate, of, anyone, so, remanded, the, secular, arm, didn, t, have, access, to, the, trial, record, of, the, defendants, only, executed, the, sentences, and, was, obliged, to, do, so, on, pain, of, heresy, and, excommunication, the, 1578, edition, of, the, directorium, inquisitorum, a, standard,

resorting, to, executions, such, punishments, were, opposed, by, a, number, of, clergymen, and, theologians, although, some, countries, punished, heresy, with, the, death, penalty, pope, siricius, ambrose, of, milan, and, martin, of, tours, protested, against, the, execution, of, priscillian, largely, as, an, undue, interference, in, ecclesiastical, discipline, by, a, civil, tribunal, though, widely, viewed, as, a, heretic, priscillian, was, executed, as, a, sorcerer, ambrose, refused, to, give, any, recognition, to, ithacius, of, ossonuba, not, wishing, to, have, anything, to, do, with,

the, various, inquisitions, that, started, around, 1184, including, the, episcopal, inquisition, 1184, 1230s, and, later, the, papal, inquisition, 1230s, these, inquisitions, responded, to, large, popular, movements, throughout, europe, considered, apostate, or, heretical, to, christianity, in, particular, the, cathars, in, southern, france, and, the, waldensians, in, both, southern, france, and, northern, italy, other, inquisitions, followed, after, these, first, inquisition, movements, the, legal, basis, for, some, inquisitorial, activity, came, from, pope, innocent, iv, s, papal, bull, ad, extirpanda, of, 1252, which, authorized, the, use, of, tortures, in, certain, circumstances, by, the, inquisition, for, eliciting, confessions, and, denunciations, from, heretics, by, 1256,

from, the, earlier, ancient, roman, court, procedures, they, judged, heresy, along, with, bishops, and, groups, of, assessors, clergy, serving, in, a, role, that, was, roughly, analogous, to, a, jury,

of, executions, of, people, suspected, of, witchcraft, in, northern, italy, in, the, 15th, and, early, 16th, centuries, wolfgang, behringer, estimates, that, there, could, have, been, as, many, as, two, thousand, executions, this, large, number, of, witches, executed, was, probably, because, some, inquisitors, took, the, view, that, the, crime, of, witchcraft, was, exceptional, which, meant, that, the, usual, rules, for, heresy, trials, did, not, apply, to, its, perpetrators, many, alleged, witches, were, executed, even, though, they, were, first, tried, and, pleaded, guilty, which, under, normal, rules, would, have, meant, only, canonical, sanctions, not, death, sentences, the, episcopal, inquisition, was, also, active, in, suppressing, alleged, witches, in, 1518, judges,

france, has, the, best, preserved, archives, of, the, medieval, inquisition, 13th, 14th, centuries, although, they, are, still, very, incomplete, the, activity, of, the, inquisition, in, this, country, was, very, diverse, both, in, terms, of, time, and, territory, in, the, first, period, 1233, to, c, 1330, the, courts, of, languedoc, toulouse, carcassonne, are, the, most, active, after, 1330, the, center, of, the, persecution, of, heretics, shifted, to, the, alpine, regions, while, in, languedoc, they, ceased, almost, entirely, in, northern, france, the, activity, of, the, inquisition, was, irregular, throughout, this, period, and, except, for, the, first, few, years, it, was, not, very, intense, france, s, first, dominican, inquisitor, robert, le, bougre, working, in, the, years, 1233, 1244, earned, a, particularly, grim, reputation, in, 1236, robert, burned, about, 50, people, in, the, area, of, champagne, and, flanders, and, on, may, 13, 1239, in, montwimer, he, burned, 183, cathars, following, robert, s, removal, from, office, inquisition, activity, in, northern, france, remained, very, low, one, of, the, largest, trials, in, the, area, took, place, in, 1459, 1460, at, arras, 34, people, were, then, accused, of, witchcraft, and, satanism, 12, of, them, were, burned, at, the, stake, the, main, center, of, the, medieval, inquisition, was, undoubtedly, the, languedoc, the, first, inquisitors, were, appointed, there, in, 1233, but, due, to, strong, resistance, from, local, communities, in, the, early, years, most, sentences, concerned, dead, heretics, whose, bodies, were, exhumed, and, burned, actual, executions, occurred, sporadically, and, until, the, fall, of, the, fortress, of, montsegur, 1244, probably, accounted, for, no, more, than, 1, of, all, sentences, in, addition, to, the, cremation, of, the, remains, of, the, dead, a, large, percentage, were, also, sentences, in, absentia, and, penances, imposed, on, heretics, who, voluntarily, confessed, their, faults, for, example, in, the, years, 1241, 1242, the, inquisitor, pierre, ceila, reconciled, 724, heretics, with, the, church, inquisitor, ferrier, of, catalonia, investigating, montauban, between, 1242, and, 1244, questioned, about, 800, people, of, whom, he, sentenced, 6, to, death, and, 20, to, prison, between, 1243, and, 1245, bernard, de, caux, handed, down, 25, sentences, of, imprisonment, and, confiscation, of, property, in, agen, and, cahors, after, the, fall, of, montsegur, and, the, seizure, of, power, in, toulouse, by, count, alfonso, de, poitiers, the, percentage, of, death, sentences, increased, to, around, 7, and, remained, at, this, level, until, the, end, of, the, languedoc, inquisition, around, from, 1330, between, 1245, and, 1246, the, inquisitor, bernard, de, caux, carried, out, a, large, scale, investigation, in, the, area, of, lauragais, and, lavaur, he, covered, 39, villages, and, probably, all, the, adult, inhabitants, 5, 471, people, were, questioned, of, whom, 207, were, found, guilty, of, heresy, of, these, 207, no, one, was, sentenced, to, death, 23, were, sentenced, to, prison, and, 184, to,

death, 239, to, prison, in, addition, 30, people, were, sentenced, in, absentia, and, 11, posthumously, in, another, five, cases, the, type, of, sanction, is, unknown, but, since, they, all, involve, repeat, offenders, only, prison, or, burning, is, at, stake, between, 1237, and, 1279, at, least, 507, convictions, were, passed, in, toulouse, most, in, absentia, or, posthumously, resulting, in, the, confiscation, of, property, in, albi, between, 1240, and, 1252, there, were, 60, sentences, of, this, type, the, activities, of, bernard, gui, inquisitor, of, toulouse, from, 1307, to, 1323, are, better, documented, as, a, complete, record, of, his, trials, has, been, preserved, during, the, entire, period, of, his, inquisitorial, activity, he, handed, down, 633, sentences, against, 602, people, 31, repeat, offenders, including, in, addition, bernard, gui, issued, 274, more, sentences, involving, the, mitigation, of, sentences, already, served, to, convicted, heretics, in, 139, cases, he, exchanged, prison, for, carrying, crosses, and, in, 135, cases, carrying, crosses, for, pilgrimage, to, the, full, statistics, there, are, 22, orders, to, demolish, houses, used, by, heretics, as,

inquisition, moved, east, to, the, alpine, regions, where, there, were, numerous, waldensian, communities, the, repression, against, them, was, not, continuous, and, was, very, ineffective, data, on, sentences, issued, by, inquisitors, are, fragmentary, in, 1348, 12, waldensians, were, burned, in, embrun, and, in, 1353, 1354, as, many, as, 168, received, penances, in, general, however, few, waldensians, fell, into, the, hands, of, the, inquisition, for, they, took, refuge, in, hard, to, reach, mountainous, regions, where, they, formed, close, knit, communities, inquisitors, operating, in, this, region, in, order, to, be, able, to, conduct, trials, often, had, to, resort, to, the, armed, assistance, of, local, secular, authorities, e, g, military, expeditions, in, 1338, 1339, and, 1366, in, the, years, 1375, 1393, with, some, breaks, the, dauphin, was, the, scene, of, the, activities, of, the, inquisitor, francois, borel, who, gained, an, extremely, gloomy, reputation, among, the, locals, it, is, known, that, on, july, 1, 1380, he, pronounced, death, sentences, in, absentia, against, 169, people, including, 108, from, the, valpute, valley, 32, from, argentiere, and, 29,

them, were, pronounced, in, absentia, the, rhineland, and, thuringia, in, the, years, 1231, 1233, were, the, field, of, activity, of, the, notorious, inquisitor, konrad, of, marburg, unfortunately, the, documentation, of, his, trials, has, not, been, preserved, making, it, impossible, to, determine, the, number, of, his, victims, the, chronicles, only, mention, many, heretics, that, he, burned, the, only, concrete, information, is, about, the, burning, of, four, people, in, erfurt, in, may, 1232, after, the, murder, of, konrad, of, marburg, burning, at, the, stake, in, germany, was, virtually, unknown, for, the, next, 80, years, it, was, not, until, the, early, fourteenth, century, that, stronger, measures, were, taken, against, heretics, largely, at, the, initiative, of, bishops, in, the, years, 1311, 1315, numerous, trials, were, held, against, the, waldensians, in, austria, resulting, in, the, burning, of, at, least, 39, people, according, to, incomplete, records,

the, trials, of, the, waldensians, in, austria, in, 1397, where, more, than, a, hundred, waldensians, were, burned, at, the, stake, however, it, seems, that, in, these, trials, the, death, sentences, represented, only, a, small, percentage, of, all, the, sentences, because, according, to, the, account, of, one, of, the, inquisitors, involved, in, these, repressions, the, number, of, heretics, reconciled, with, the, church, from, thuringia, to, hungary, amounted, to, about, 2, 000, in, 1414, the, inquisitor, heinrich, von, sch, neveld, arrested, 84, flagellants, in, sangerhausen, of, whom, he, burned, 3, leaders, and, imposed, penitential, sentences, on, the, rest, however, since, this, sect, was, associated, with, the, peasant, revolts, in, thuringia, from, 1412, after, the, departure, of, the, inquisitor, the, local, authorities, organized, a, mass, hunt, for, flagellants, and, regardless, of, their, previous, verdicts, sent, at, least, 168, to, the, stake, possibly, up, to, 300,

about, this, activity, numerous, conversions, and, executions, of, bosnian, cathars, are, known, to, have, taken, place, around, 1239, 40, and, in, 1268, the, dominican, inquisitor, andrew,

although, anti, heretical, repressions, were, carried, out, as, early, as, 1315, in, the, episcopal, inquisition, when, more, than, 50, waldensians, were, burned, in, various, silesian, cities, the,

of, almost, 300, interrogated, but, it, is, estimated, that, the, actual, number, executed, could, have, been, even, more, than, 200, and, the, entire, process, was, covered, to, varying, degrees, by, some, 4, 400, people, in, the, lands, belonging, to, the, kingdom, of, poland, little, is, known, of, the, activities, of, the, inquisition, until, the, appearance, of, the, hussite, heresy, in, the,

of, the, inquisitor, cardinal, d, henrique, and, the, last, in, 1774, this, sponsored, by, the, marquis, of, pombal, the, portuguese, 1640, regiment, determined, that, each, court, of, the, holy,

sharpening, of, debate, and, of, conflict, between, the, protestant, reformation, and, the, catholic, counter, reformation, protestant, societies, came, to, see, use, the, inquisition, as, a, terrifying, other, while, staunch, catholics, regarded, the, holy, office, as, a, necessary, bulwark, against, the, spread, of, reprehensible, heresies, since, the, beginning, of, the, most, serious, heretic, groups, like, the, cathars, or, the, waldensians, they, were, soon, accused, of, the, most, fantastic, behavior, like, having, wild, sexual, orgies, eating, babies, copulating, with, demons, worshipping, the, devil, while, belief, in, witchcraft, and, persecutions, directed, at, or, excused, by, it, were, widespread, in, pre, christian, europe, and, reflected, in, germanic, law, the, influence, of, the, church, in, the, early, medieval, era, resulted, in, the, revocation, of, these, laws, in, many, places, bringing, an, end, to, traditional, pagan, witch, hunts, throughout, the, medieval, era, mainstream, christian, teaching, had, denied, the, existence, of, witches, and, witchcraft, condemning, it, as, pagan, superstition, however, christian, influence, on, popular, beliefs, in, witches, and, maleficium, harm, committed, by, magic, failed, to, entirely, eradicate, folk, belief, in, witches, the, fierce, denunciation, and, persecution, of, supposed, sorceresses, that, characterized, the, cruel, witchhunts, of, a, later, age, were, not, generally, found, in, the, first, thirteen, hundred, years, of, the, christian, era, the, medieval, church, distinguished, between, white, and, black, magic, local, folk, practice, often, mixed, chants, incantations, and, prayers, to, the, appropriate, patron, saint, to, ward, off, storms, to, protect, cattle, or, ensure, a, good,

charitable, work, assigned, as, penance, early, irish, canons, treated, sorcery, as, a, crime, to, be, visited, with, excommunication, until, adequate, penance, had, been, performed, in, 1258, pope, alexander, iv, ruled, that, inquisitors, should, limit, their, involvement, to, those, cases, in, which, there, was, some, clear, presumption, of, heretical, belief, but, slowly, this, vision, changed, the, prosecution, of, witchcraft, generally, became, more, prominent, in, the, late, medieval, and, renaissance, era, perhaps, driven, partly, by, the, upheavals, of, the, era, the, black, death, the, hundred, years, war, and, a, gradual, cooling, of, the, climate, that, modern, scientists, call, the, little, ice, age, between, about, the, 15th, and, 19th, centuries, witches, were, sometimes, blamed, since, the, years, of, most, intense, witch, hunting, largely, coincide, with, the, age, of, the, protestant, reformation, and, counter, reformation, some, historians, point, to, the, influence, of, the, reformation, on, the, european, witch, hunt, however, witch, hunting, began, almost, one, hundred, years, before, luther, s, ninety, five, theses, dominican, priest, heinrich, kramer, was, assistant, to, the, archbishop, of, salzburg, in, 1484, kramer, requested, that, pope, innocent, viii, clarify, his, authority, to, prosecute, witchcraft, in, germany, where, he, had, been, refused, assistance, by, the, local, ecclesiastical, authorities, they, maintained, that, kramer, could, not, legally, function, in, their, areas, the, papal, bull, summis, desiderantes, affectibus, the, witch, bull, sought, to, remedy, this, jurisdictional, dispute, by, specifically, identifying, the, dioceses, of, mainz, k, ln, trier, salzburg, and, bremen, the, bull, stated, that, many, persons, of, both, sexes, unmindful, of, their, own, salvation, and, straying, from, the, catholic, faith, have, abandoned, themselves, to, devils, incubi, and, succubi, some, scholars, view, the, bull, as, clearly, political, the, bull, failed, to, ensure, that, kramer, obtained, the, support, he, had, hoped, for, in, fact, he, was, subsequently, expelled, from, the, city, of, innsbruck, by, the, local, bishop, george, golzer, who, ordered, kramer, to, stop, making, false, accusations, golzer, described, kramer, as, senile, in, letters, written, shortly, after, the, incident, this, rebuke, led, kramer, to, write, a, justification, of, his, views, on, witchcraft, in, his, 1486, book, malleus, maleficarum, hammer, against, witches, the, book, is, noted, for, its, hatred, against, women, in, the, malleus, kramer, stated, that, witchcraft, was, feminine, women, were, prone, to, it, due, to, their, weakness, their, alleged, insatiable, sexual, lust, being, intellectually, like, children, his, work, distinguishes, itself, from, other, demonologies, by, its, obsessive, hate, of, women, and, sex, seemingly, reflecting, the, twisted, psyche, of, the, author, levack, calls, this, scholastic, pornography, and, malcolm, gaskill, finds, kramer, a, superstitious, psychopath, despite, kramer, s, claim, that, the, book, gained, acceptance, from, the, clergy, at, the, university, of, cologne, it, was, in, fact, condemned, by, the, clergy, at, cologne, for, advocating, views, that, violated, catholic, doctrine, and, standard, inquisitorial, procedure, in, 1538, the, spanish, inquisition, cautioned, its, members, not, to, believe, everything, the, malleus, said, despite, this, heinrich, kramer, was, never, excommunicated, and, even, enjoyed, considerable, prestige, till, his, death, portugal, and, spain, in, the, late, middle, ages, consisted, largely, of, multicultural, territories, of, muslim, and, jewish, influence, reconquered, from, islamic, control, and, the, new, christian, authorities, could, not, assume, that, all, their, subjects, would, suddenly, become, and, remain, orthodox, catholics, so, the, inquisition, in, iberia, in, the, lands, of, the, reconquista, counties, and, kingdoms, like, le, n, castile, and, aragon, had, a, special, socio, political, basis, as, well, as, more, fundamental, religious, motives, in, some, parts, of, spain, towards, the, end, of, the, 14th, century, there, was, a, wave, of, violent, anti, judaism, encouraged, by, the, preaching, of, ferrand, mart, nez, archdeacon, of, cija, in, the, pogroms, of, june, 1391, in, seville, hundreds, of, jews, were, killed, and, the, synagogue, was, completely, destroyed, the, number, of, people, killed, was, also, high, in, other, cities, such, as, c, rdoba, valencia, and, barcelona, one, of, the, consequences, of, these, pogroms, was, the, mass, conversion, of, thousands, of, surviving, jews, forced, baptism, was, contrary, to, the, law, of, the, catholic, church, and, theoretically, anybody, who, had, been, forcibly, baptized, could, legally, return, to, judaism, however, this, was, very, narrowly, interpreted, legal, definitions, of, the, time, theoretically, acknowledged, that, a, forced, baptism, was, not, a, valid, sacrament, but, confined, this, to, cases, where, it, was, literally, administered, by, physical, force, a, person, who, had, consented, to, baptism, under, threat, of, death, or, serious, injury, was, still, regarded, as, a, voluntary, convert, and, accordingly, forbidden, to, revert, to, judaism, after, the, public, violence, many, of, the, converted, felt, it, safer, to, remain, in, their, new, religion, thus, after, 1391, a, new, social, group, appeared, and, were, referred, to, as, conversos, or, new, christians, king, ferdinand, ii, of, aragon, and, queen, isabella, i, of, castile, established, the, spanish, inquisition, in, 1478, in, contrast, to, the, previous, inquisitions, it, operated, completely, under, royal, christian, authority, though, staffed, by, clergy, and, orders, and, independently, of, the, holy, see, it, operated, in, spain, and, in, most, spanish, colonies, and, territories, which, included, the, canary, islands, the, kingdom, of, sicily, and, all, spanish, possessions, in, north, central, and, south, america, it, primarily, focused, upon, forced, converts, from, islam, moriscos, conversos, and, secret, moors, and, from, judaism, conversos, crypto, jews, and, marranos, both, groups, still, resided, in, spain, after, the, end, of, the, islamic, control, of, spain, who, came, under, suspicion, of, either, continuing, to, adhere, to, their, old, religion, or, of, having, fallen, back, into, it, all, jews, who, had, not, converted, were, expelled, from, spain, in, 1492, and, all, muslims, ordered, to, convert, in, different, stages, starting, in, 1501, those, who, converted, or, simply, remained, after, the, relevant, edict, became, nominally, and, legally, catholics, and, thus, subject, to, the, inquisition, in, 1569, king, philip, ii, of, spain, set, up, three, tribunals, in, the, americas, each, formally, titled, tribunal, del, santo, oficio, de, la, inquisici, n, one, in, mexico, one, in, cartagena, de, indias, in, modern, day, colombia, and, one, in, peru, the, mexican, office, administered, mexico, central, and, southeastern, mexico, nueva, galicia, northern, and, western, mexico, the, audiencias, of, guatemala, guatemala, chiapas, el, salvador, honduras, nicaragua, costa, rica, and, the, spanish, east, indies, the, peruvian, inquisition, based, in, lima, administered, all, the, spanish, territories, in, south, america, and, panama, the, portuguese, inquisition, formally, started, in, portugal, in, 1536, at, the, request, of, king, jo, o, iii, manuel, i, had, asked, pope, leo, x, for, the, installation, of, the, inquisition, in, 1515, but, only, after, his, death, in, 1521, did, pope, paul, iii, acquiesce, at, its, head, stood, a, grande, inquisidor, or, general, inquisitor, named, by, the, pope, but, selected, by, the, crown, and, always, from, within, the, royal, family, the, portuguese, inquisition, principally, focused, upon, the, sephardi, jews, whom, the, state, forced, to, convert, to, christianity, spain, had, expelled, its, sephardi, population, in, 1492, many, of, these, spanish, jews, left, spain, for, portugal, but, eventually, were, subject, to, inquisition, there, as, well, the, portuguese, inquisition, held, its, first, auto, da, f, in, 1540, the, portuguese, inquisitors, mostly, focused, upon, the, jewish, new, christians, i, e, conversos, or, marranos, the, portuguese, inquisition, expanded, its, scope, of, operations, from, portugal, to, its, colonial, possessions, including, brazil, cape, verde, and, goa, in, the, colonies, it, continued, as, a, religious, court, investigating, and, trying, cases, of, breaches, of, the, tenets, of, orthodox, catholicism, until, 1821, king, jo, o, iii, reigned, 1521, 57, extended, the, activity, of, the, courts, to, cover, censorship, divination, witchcraft, and, bigamy, originally, oriented, for, a, religious, action, the, inquisition, exerted, an, influence, over, almost, every, aspect, of, portuguese, society, political, cultural, and, social, according, to, henry, charles, lea, between, 1540, and, 1794, tribunals, in, lisbon, porto, coimbra, and, vora, resulted, in, the, burning, of, 1, 175, persons, the, burning, of, another, 633, in, effigy, and, the, penancing, of, 29, 590, but, documentation, of, 15, out, of, 689, autos, da, f, has, disappeared, so, these, numbers, may, slightly, understate, the, activity, the, goa, inquisition, began, in, 1560, at, the, order, of, john, iii, of, portugal, it, had, originally, been, requested, in, a, letter, in, the, 1540s, by, jesuit, priest, francis, xavier, because, of, the, new, christians, who, had, arrived, in, goa, and, then, reverted, to, judaism, the, goa, inquisition, also, focused, upon, catholic, converts, from, hinduism, or, islam, who, were, thought, to, have, returned, to, their, original, ways, in, addition, this, inquisition, prosecuted, non, converts, who, broke, prohibitions, against, the, public, observance, of, hindu, or, muslim, rites, or, interfered, with, portuguese, attempts, to, convert, non, christians, to, catholicism, aleixo, dias, falc, o, and, francisco, marques, set, it, up, in, the, palace, of, the, sabaio, adil, khan, the, inquisition, was, active, in, colonial, brazil, the, religious, mystic, and, formerly, enslaved, prostitute, rosa, egipc, aca, was, arrested, interrogated, and, imprisoned, both, in, the, colony, and, in, lisbon, egipc, aca, was, the, first, black, woman, in, brazil, to, write, a, book, this, work, detailed, her, visions, and, was, entitled, sagrada, teologia, do, amor, divino, das, almas, peregrinas, with, the, protestant, reformation, catholic, authorities, became, much, more, ready, to, suspect, heresy, in, any, new, ideas, including, those, of, renaissance, humanism, previously, strongly, supported, by, many, at, the, top, of, the, church, hierarchy, the, extirpation, of, heretics, became, a, much, broader, and, more, complex, enterprise, complicated, by, the, politics, of, territorial, protestant, powers, especially, in, northern, europe, the, catholic, church, could, no, longer, exercise, direct, influence, in, the, politics, and, justice, systems, of, lands, that, officially, adopted, protestantism, thus, war, the, french, wars, of, religion, the, thirty, years, war, massacre, the, st, bartholomew, s, day, massacre, and, the, missional, and, propaganda, work, by, the, sacra, congregatio, de, propaganda, fide, of, the, catholic, counter, reformation, came, to, play, larger, roles, in, these, circumstances, and, the, roman, law, type, of, a, judicial, approach, to, heresy, represented, by, the, inquisition, became, less, important, overall, in, 1542, pope, paul, iii, established, the, congregation, of, the, holy, office, of, the, inquisition, as, a, permanent, congregation, staffed, with, cardinals, and, other, officials, it, had, the, tasks, of, maintaining, and, defending, the, integrity, of, the, faith, and, of, examining, and, proscribing, errors, and, false, doctrines, it, thus, became, the, supervisory, body, of, local, inquisitions, a, famous, case, tried, by, the, roman, inquisition, was, that, of, galileo, galilei, in, 1633, the, penances, and, sentences, for, those, who, confessed, or, were, found, guilty, were, pronounced, together, in, a, public, ceremony, at, the, end, of, all, the, processes, this, was, the, sermo, generalis, or, auto, da, f, penances, not, matters, for, the, civil, authorities, might, consist, of, pilgrimages, a, public, scourging, a, fine, or, the, wearing, of, a, cross, the, wearing, of, two, tongues, of, red, or, other, brightly, colored, cloth, sewn, onto, an, outer, garment, in, an, x, pattern, marked, those, who, were, under, investigation, the, penalties, in, serious, cases, were, confiscation, of, property, by, the, inquisition, or, imprisonment, this, led, to, the, possibility, of, false, charges, to, enable, confiscation, being, made, against, those, over, a, certain, income, particularly, rich, marranos, following, the, french, invasion, of, 1798, the, new, authorities, sent, 3, 000, chests, containing, over, 100, 000, inquisition, documents, to, france, from, rome, the, usual, procedure, began, with, the, visitation, by, the, inquisitors, in, a, chosen, location, the, so, called, heretics, were, then, asked, to, be, present, and, denounce, themselves, and, others, it, was, not, enough, to, denounce, himself, as, a, heretic, many, confessed, alleged, heresies, for, fear, that, a, friend, or, neighbor, might, do, so, later, the, terror, of, the, inquisition, provoked, chain, reactions, and, denunciations, even, of, spouses, children, and, friends, if, they, confessed, within, a, grace, period, usually, 30, days, they, could, be, accepted, back, into, the, church, without, punishment, in, general, the, benefits, proposed, by, the, edicts, of, grace, to, those, who, presented, themselves, spontaneously, were, the, forgiveness, of, the, death, penalty, or, life, imprisonment, and, the, forgiveness, of, the, penalty, of, confiscation, of, property, anyone, suspected, of, knowing, about, another, s, heresy, and, who, did, not, make, the, obligatory, denunciation, would, be, excommunicated, and, then, subject, to, prosecution, as, a, promoter, of, heresy, if, the, denouncer, named, other, potential, heretics, they, would, also, be, summoned, all, types, of, complaints, were, accepted, by, the, inquisition, regardless, of, the, reputation, or, position, of, the, complainant, rumors, mere, suppositions, and, even, anonymous, letters, were, accepted, if, the, case, were, of, such, a, nature, that, such, action, seemed, appropriate, to, the, service, of, god, and, the, good, of, the, faith, it, was, foreseen, that, prison, guards, themselves, could, report, and, be, witnesses, against, the, accused, this, strategy, transformed, everyone, into, an, inquisition, agent, reminding, them, that, a, simple, word, or, deed, could, bring, them, before, the, tribunal, denunciation, was, elevated, to, the, status, of, a, superior, religious, duty, filling, the, nation, with, spies, and, making, every, individual, suspicious, of, his, neighbor, family, members, and, any, strangers, he, might, met, defendants, were, interrogated, under, torture, only, in, extreme, cases, and, were, punished, if, found, guilty, with, their, property, being, confiscated, to, cover, legal, and, prison, costs, and, to, maintain, the, extensive, machinery, of, persecution, the, victims, could, also, repent, of, their, accusation, and, receive, reconciliation, with, the, church, the, execution, of, the, tortures, was, attended, by, the, inquisitor, the, doctor, the, secretary, and, the, executioner, applying, them, on, the, nearly, naked, prisoner, in, the, year, 1252, the, bull, ad, extirpanda, allowed, torture, but, always, with, a, doctor, involved, to, avoid, endangering, life, and, limited, its, use, to, non, bloody, methods, according, to, catholic, apologists, the, method, of, torture, which, was, socially, accepted, in, the, context, of, the, time, was, adopted, only, in, exceptional, cases, and, the, inquisitorial, procedure, was, meticulously, regulated, in, interrogation, practices, the, summary, of, the, directorium, inquisitorum, by, nicol, s, aymerich, made, by, marchena, notes, a, comment, by, the, aragonese, inquisitor, quaestiones, sunt, fallaces, et, inefficaces, the, interrogations, are, misleading, and, useless, this, did, not, stop, the, use, of, torture, strongly, advised, in, the, volume, by, aymerich, himself, despite, the, loss, of, thousands, of, documents, over, the, years, many, of, the, meticulous, records, of, torture, sessions, have, survived, they, are, extraordinary, documents, dry, bureaucratic, expositions, which, record, even, the, screams, of, the, tortured, and, which, go, on, for, pages, and, pages, despite, what, is, popularly, believed, the, cases, in, which, torture, was, used, during, the, inquisitorial, processes, were, rare, since, it, was, considered, according, to, some, authors, to, be, ineffective, in, obtaining, evidence, before, torture, inquisitors, displayed, the, instruments, mainly, on, the, purpose, of, intimidation, of, the, accused, so, he, may, understood, what, to, expect, if, he, wished, to, avoid, punishment, he, should, only, confess, his, faults, in, the, words, of, historian, helen, mary, carrel, the, common, view, of, the, medieval, justice, system, as, cruel, and, based, on, torture, and, execution, is, often, unfair, and, inaccurate, as, the, historian, nigel, townson, wrote, the, sinister, torture, chambers, equipped, with, cogwheels, bone, crushing, contraptions, shackles, and, other, terrifying, mechanisms, only, existed, in, the, imagination, of, their, detractors, in, fact, it, seems, likely, that, the, inquisition, favoured, simpler, and, cleaner, methods, which, left, few, apparent, marks, aymerich, points, out, that, canon, law, does, not, prescribe, either, this, or, that, particular, torture, so, judges, can, use, whatever, they, see, fit, as, long, as, it, s, not, an, unusual, torture, many, types, of, torments, have, been, chosen, but, eymerich, think, they, seem, more, like, the, inventions, of, executioners, than, the, works, of, theologians, it, is, true, that, it, is, a, very, praiseworthy, practice, to, subject, the, accused, to, torture, but, no, less, reprehensible, are, those, bloodthirsty, judges, who, base, their, vain, glory, on, the, invention, of, crude, and, exquisite, torments, he, adds, many, torture, instruments, were, designed, by, late, 18th, and, early, 19th, century, pranksters, entertainers, and, con, artists, who, wanted, to, profit, from, people, s, morbid, interest, in, the, dark, age, myth, by, charging, them, to, witness, such, instruments, in, victorian, era, circuses, however, several, torture, instruments, are, accurately, described, in, foxe, s, book, of, martyrs, including, but, not, limited, to, the, dry, pan, some, of, the, instruments, that, the, inquisition, never, used, but, that, are, erroneously, registered, in, various, inquisition, museums, the, inquisition, s, trials, were, secret, and, there, was, no, possibility, of, appealing, the, decisions, the, defendant, was, constantly, pressured, to, confess, to, the, crimes, assigned, to, him, the, inquisitors, kept, the, accusations, made, and, the, evidence, they, possessed, hidden, in, order, to, achieve, a, confession, without, announcing, the, accusation, the, main, goal, was, to, make, the, defendant, confess, each, court, had, its, own, staff, lawyers, prosecutors, notaries, etc, and, its, own, prison, the, guards, who, served, the, inquisition, spied, the, accused, in, their, cells, if, they, refused, to, eat, for, example, this, action, could, be, considered, a, fast, a, jewish, custom, in, many, cases, it, was, common, for, false, accusations, to, be, made, against, new, christians, and, it, was, difficult, to, prove, their, innocence, it, was, therefore, more, convenient, for, many, to, make, a, false, confession, to, the, inquisitors, including, a, list, of, imaginary, accomplices, in, the, hope, that, they, would, not, receive, extreme, penalties, such, as, the, death, penalty, but, only, the, confiscation, of, property, or, lesser, penalties, in, fact, there, wasn, t, a, trial, in, the, modern, sense, of, the, term, but, an, extensive, interrogation, the, prisoner, was, kept, in, the, dark, about, the, reasons, for, his, arrest, often, for, months, or, even, years, there, was, no, precise, accusation, and, therefore, little, chance, of, a, plausible, defence, the, prisoner, was, simply, advised, to, search, his, conscience, confess, the, truth, and, trust, to, the, mercy, of, the, tribunal, eventually, the, prisoner, was, informed, of, the, charges, against, him, omitting, the, names, of, the, witnesses, thus, the, charade, continued, after, the, interminable, interrogations, hearings, and, waiting, periods, came, to, an, end, the, sentence, could, be, pronounced, the, inquisition, trials, had, little, to, do, with, justice, walter, ullmann, a, historian, summarises, his, evaluation, there, is, hardly, one, item, in, the, whole, inquisitorial, procedure, that, could, be, squared, with, the, demands, of, justice, on, the, contrary, every, one, of, its, items, is, the, denial, of, justice, or, a, hideous, caricature, of, it, its, principles, are, the, very, denial, of, the, demands, made, by, the, most, primitive, concepts, of, natural, justice, this, kind, of, proceeding, has, no, longer, any, semblance, to, a, judicial, trial, but, is, rather, its, systematic, and, methodical, perversion, in, one, of, his, books, portuguese, author, a, jos, saraiva, points, out, the, analogy, of, the, trials, with, the, absurdity, of, the, kafka, s, novel, the, trial, or, the, show, trials, of, stalin, s, era, in, moscow, the, inquisition, s, sentences, could, be, simple, penances, for, example, private, devotions, or, heavy, punishments, one, of, the, inquisition, s, punishments, was, the, forced, wearing, of, distinctive, clothing, or, signs, such, as, the, sambenito, sometimes, for, an, entire, life, other, punishments, were, exile, compulsory, pilgrimages, fines, the, galleys, life, imprisonment, in, fact, prison, for, some, years, and, in, addition, the, confiscation, of, goods, and, property, the, bull, ad, extirpanda, determined, that, the, houses, of, heretics, should, be, completely, razed, to, the, ground, furthermore, the, impact, of, the, inquisition, s, activity, on, the, fabric, of, society, was, not, limited, to, these, penances, or, punishments, as, under, the, terror, of, the, inquisition, entire, families, denounced, each, other, they, were, soon, reduced, to, misery, completed, by, the, confiscation, of, property, public, humiliation, and, ostracism, even, dead, people, could, be, accused, and, sentenced, up, to, forty, years, after, the, death, when, inquisitors, considered, proven, that, the, deceased, were, heretics, in, their, lifetime, their, corpses, were, exhumed, and, burned, their, property, confiscated, and, the, heirs, disinherited, the, inquisition, always, referred, to, biblical, passages, as, well, as, to, church, fathers, like, augustine, of, hippo, to, legitimise, his, actuation, the, new, testament, contains, some, sentences, that, the, church, could, interpret, for, dealing, with, heretics, the, excommunication, of, a, deviant, from, the, faith, was, equivalent, to, handing, him, over, to, the, devil, when, you, have, gathered, together, and, my, spirit, with, you, in, the, power, of, our, lord, jesus, hand, this, man, over, to, satan, for, destruction, of, the, flesh, so, that, his, spirit, may, be, saved, on, the, day, of, the, lord, the, pauline, letters, 1, corinthians, b, incest, in, corinth, 5, 4, and, 5, 5, the, sentence, of, paul, could, also, be, understood, in, this, way, he, handed, over, to, the, devil, those, who, have, suffered, shipwreck, in, the, faith, so, that, they, may, be, taught, not, to, be, blasphemous, the, pastoral, epistles, 1, timothy, the, first, letter, from, paul, to, timothy, timothy, s, responsibility, 1, 19, and, 1, 20, paul, s, view, reflects, less, the, idea, of, punishment, than, the, idea, of, isolation, when, he, says, after, a, first, and, second, warning, have, nothing, to, do, with, a, disputatious, person, since, you, may, be, sure, that, such, a, person, is, warped, and, is, self, condemned, as, a, sinner, the, pastoral, epistles, titus, the, letter, from, paul, to, titus, 3, 10, and, 3, 11, in, the, gospel, of, john, jesus, tells, the, apostates, in, a, parable, i, am, the, vine, you, are, the, branches, whoever, remains, in, me, and, i,

regions, and, times, there, was, opposition, to, the, inquisition, heretics, and, other, targets, did, not, hesitate, to, attempt, to, murder, the, inquisitors, or, destroy, its, voluminous, archives, because, they, had, much, to, lose, in, the, face, of, an, inquisitorial, investigation, their, freedom, their, property, their, lives, opposition, sometimes, came, from, more, tolerant, and, open, minded, individuals, within, the, clergy, itself, the, much, hated, inquisitor, konrad, von, marburg, who, also, initiated, inquisition, trials, against, nobles, was, murdered, in, 1233, by, six,
