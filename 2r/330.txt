the, visigothic, kingdom, visigothic, spain, or, kingdom, of, the, goths, latin, regnum, gothorum, occupied, what, is, now, southwestern, france, and, the, iberian, peninsula, from, the, 5th, to, the, 8th, centuries, one, of, the, germanic, successor, states, to, the, western, roman, empire, it, was, originally, created, by, the, settlement, of, the, visigoths, under, king, wallia, in, the, province, of, gallia, aquitania, in, southwest, gaul, by, the, roman, government, and, then, extended, by, conquest, over, all, of, hispania, the, kingdom, maintained, independence, from, the, eastern, roman, or, byzantine, empire, whose, attempts, to, re, establish, roman, authority, in, hispania, were, only, partially, successful, and, short, lived, the, visigoths, were, romanized, central, europeans, who, had, moved, west, from, the, danube, valley, they, became, foederati, of, rome, and, wanted, to, restore, the, roman, order, against, the, hordes, of, vandals, alans, and, suebi, the, western, roman, empire, fell, in, 476, ad, therefore, the, visigoths, believed, they, had, the, right, to, take, the, territories, that, rome, had, promised, in, hispania, in, exchange, for, restoring, the, roman, order, under, king, euric, who, eliminated, the, status, of, foederati, a, triumphal, advance, of, the, visigoths, began, alarmed, at, visigoth, expansion, from, aquitania, after, victory, over, the, gallo, roman, and, breton, armies, at, d, ols, in, 469, western, emperor, anthemius, sent, a, fresh, army, across, the, alps, against, euric, who, was, besieging, arles, the, roman, army, was, crushed, in, the, battle, of, arles, nearby, and, euric, then, captured, arles, and, secured, much, of, southern, gaul, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, regnum, tolosae, or, kingdom, of, toulouse, after, its, capital, toulouse, in, modern, historiography, the, kingdom, lost, much, of, its, territory, in, gaul, to, the, franks, in, the, early, 6th, century, save, the, narrow, coastal, strip, of, septimania, the, kingdom, of, the, 6th, and, 7th, centuries, is, sometimes, called, the, regnum, toletanum, or, kingdom, of, toledo, after, the, new, capital, of, toledo, in, hispania, a, civil, war, starting, in, 549, resulted, in, an, invitation, from, the, visigoth, athanagild, who, had, usurped, the, kingship, to, the, byzantine, emperor, justinian, i, to, send, soldiers, to, his, assistance, athanagild, won, his, war, but, the, byzantines, took, over, cartagena, and, a, good, deal, of, southern, hispania, until, 624, when, swinthila, expelled, the, last, byzantine, garrisons, from, the, peninsula, occupying, orcelis, which, the, visigoths, called, aurariola, today, orihuela, in, the, province, of, alicante, starting, in, the, 570s, athanagild, s, brother, liuvigild, compensated, for, this, loss, by, conquering, the, kingdom, of, the, suebi, in, gallaecia, corresponding, roughly, to, present, day, galicia, and, the, northern, part, of, portugal, and, annexing, it, and, by, repeated, campaigns, against, the, basques, the, ethnic, distinction, between, the, hispano, roman, population, and, the, visigoths, had, largely, disappeared, by, this, time, the, gothic, language, lost, its, last, and, probably, already, declining, function, as, a, church, language, when, the, visigoths, renounced, arianism, in, 589, this, newfound, unity, found, expression, in, increasingly, severe, persecution, of, outsiders, especially, the, jews, the, visigothic, code, completed, in, 654, abolished, the, old, tradition, of, having, different, laws, for, hispano, romans, and, for, visigoths, the, 7th, century, saw, many, civil, wars, between, factions, of, the, aristocracy, despite, good, records, left, by, contemporary, bishops, such, as, isidore, and, leander, of, seville, it, becomes, increasingly, difficult, to, distinguish, goths, from, hispano, romans, as, the, two, became, inextricably, intertwined, despite, these, civil, wars, by, 625, ad, the, visigoths, had, succeeded, in, expelling, the, byzantines, from, hispania, and, had, established, a, foothold, at, the, port, of, ceuta, in, africa, most, of, the, visigothic, kingdom, was, conquered, by, umayyad, troops, from, north, africa, in, 711, to, 719, with, only, the, northern, reaches, of, hispania, remaining, in, christian, hands, the, medieval, kingdom, of, asturias, in, northern, spain, reputedly, began, when, a, visigothic, nobleman, called, pelagius, was, elected, princeps, and, became, the, leader, of, the, astures, and, of, the, visigoths, who, had, taken, refuge, in, mountains, the, visigoths, and, their, early, kings, were, arians, and, came, into, conflict, with, the, church, in, rome, but, after, they, converted, to, nicene, christianity, the, church, exerted, an, enormous, influence, on, secular, affairs, through, the, councils, of, toledo, the, visigoths, also, developed, the, highly, influential, legal, code, known, in, western, europe, as, the, visigothic, code, latin, liber, iudiciorum, which, would, become, the, basis, for, spanish, law, throughout, the, middle, ages, from, 407, to, 409, ad, an, alliance, of, germanic, vandals, iranian, alans, and, germanic, suebi, crossed, the, frozen, rhine, and, swept, across, modern, france, and, into, the, iberian, peninsula, for, their, part, the, visigoths, under, alaric, famously, sacked, rome, in, 410, capturing, galla, placidia, the, sister, of, western, roman, emperor, honorius, athaulf, king, of, the, visigoths, from, 410, to, 415, spent, the, next, few, years, operating, in, the, gallic, and, hispanic, countrysides, diplomatically, playing, competing, factions, of, germanic, and, roman, commanders, against, one, another, to, skillful, effect, and, taking, over, cities, such, as, narbonne, and, toulouse, in, 413, after, he, married, placidia, the, emperor, honorius, enlisted, him, to, provide, visigothic, assistance, in, regaining, nominal, roman, control, of, hispania, from, the, vandals, alans, and, suebi, in, 418, honorius, rewarded, his, visigothic, federates, under, king, wallia, reigned, 415, 418, by, giving, them, land, in, the, garonne, valley, of, gallia, aquitania, on, which, to, settle, this, probably, took, place, under, the, system, of, hospitalitas, it, seems, likely, that, at, first, the, visigoths, were, not, given, a, large, amount, of, land, estates, in, the, region, as, previously, believed, but, that, they, acquired, the, taxes, of, the, region, with, the, local, gallic, aristocrats, now, paying, their, taxes, to, the, visigoths, instead, of, to, the, roman, government, the, visigoths, with, their, capital, at, toulouse, remained, de, facto, independent, and, soon, began, expanding, into, roman, territory, at, the, expense, of, the, feeble, western, empire, under, theodoric, i, 418, 451, the, visigoths, attacked, arles, in, 425, and, 430, and, narbonne, in, 436, but, were, checked, by, litorius, using, hunnic, mercenaries, this, resulted, at, first, in, theodoric, s, defeat, at, the, battle, of, narbonne, in, 436, but, then, in, 439, at, the, battle, of, toulouse, the, visigoths, defeated, the, allied, forces, of, romans, and, huns, by, 451, the, situation, had, reversed, and, the, huns, had, invaded, gaul, now, theodoric, fought, under, flavius, aetius, against, attila, the, hun, in, the, battle, of, the, catalaunian, plains, attila, was, driven, back, but, theodoric, was, killed, in, the, battle, the, vandals, completed, the, conquest, of, north, africa, when, they, took, carthage, on, october, 19, 439, and, the, suebi, had, taken, most, of, hispania, the, roman, emperor, avitus, now, sent, the, visigoths, into, hispania, theodoric, ii, 453, 466, invaded, and, defeated, the, king, of, the, suebi, rechiarius, at, the, battle, on, the, river, rbigo, in, 456, near, asturica, augusta, astorga, and, then, sacked, bracara, augusta, braga, the, suebi, capital, the, goths, sacked, the, cities, in, gallaecia, part, of, the, suebi, kingdom, quite, brutally, they, massacred, a, portion, of, the, population, and, even, attacked, some, holy, places, probably, due, to, the, clergy, s, support, of, the, suebi, theodoric, took, control, over, hispania, baetica, carthaginiensis, and, southern, lusitania, in, 461, the, goths, received, the, city, of, narbonne, from, the, emperor, libius, severus, in, exchange, for, their, support, this, led, to, a, revolt, by, the, army, and, by, gallo, romans, under, aegidius, as, a, result, romans, under, severus, and, the, visigoths, fought, other, roman, troops, and, the, revolt, ended, only, in, 465, in, 466, euric, who, was, the, youngest, son, of, theodoric, i, came, to, the, visigothic, throne, he, is, infamous, for, murdering, his, elder, brother, theodoric, ii, who, had, himself, become, king, by, murdering, his, elder, brother, thorismund, under, euric, 466, 484, the, visigoths, began, expanding, in, gaul, and, consolidating, their, presence, in, the, iberian, peninsula, euric, fought, a, series, of, wars, with, the, suebi, who, retained, some, influence, in, lusitania, and, brought, most, of, this, region, under, visigothic, power, taking, emerita, augusta, m, rida, in, 469, euric, also, attacked, the, western, roman, empire, capturing, hispania, tarraconensis, in, 472, the, last, bastion, of, western, roman, rule, in, spain, by, 476, he, had, extended, his, rule, to, the, rhone, and, the, loire, rivers, which, comprised, most, of, southern, gaul, he, also, occupied, the, key, roman, cities, of, arles, and, marseilles, in, his, campaigns, euric, had, counted, on, a, portion, of, the, gallo, roman, and, hispano, roman, aristocracy, who, served, under, him, as, generals, and, governors, the, visigothic, kingdom, was, formally, recognized, as, an, independent, kingdom, in, former, roman, territory, instead, of, having, the, status, of, foederati, when, the, western, emperor, julius, nepos, 474, 475, signed, in, 475, an, alliance, with, euric, granting, him, the, lands, south, of, the, loire, and, west, of, the, rhone, in, exchange, for, military, service, and, the, lands, in, provence, including, arles, and, marseilles, the, lands, in, hispania, remained, under, de, facto, visigothic, control, after, odoacer, deposed, the, last, roman, emperor, in, the, west, romulus, augustulus, euric, quickly, recaptured, provence, a, fact, which, odoacer, formally, accepted, in, a, treaty, by, 500, the, visigothic, kingdom, centered, at, toulouse, controlled, gallia, aquitania, and, gallia, narbonensis, and, most, of, hispania, with, the, exception, of, the, suebic, kingdom, of, galicia, in, the, northwest, and, small, areas, controlled, by, independent, iberian, peoples, such, as, the,
