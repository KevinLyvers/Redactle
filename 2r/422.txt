the, french, revolution, was, a, period, of, political, and, societal, change, in, france, that, began, with, the, estates, general, of, 1789, and, ended, with, the, coup, of, 18, brumaire, in, november, 1799, and, the, formation, of, the, french, consulate, many, of, its, ideas, are, considered, fundamental, principles, of, liberal, democracy, while, its, values, and, institutions, remain, central, to, modern, french, political, discourse, its, causes, are, generally, agreed, to, be, a, combination, of, social, political, and, economic, factors, which, the, ancien, r, gime, proved, unable, to, manage, a, financial, crisis, and, widespread, social, distress, led, in, may, 1789, to, the, convocation, of, the, estates, general, which, was, converted, into, a, national, assembly, in, june, the, storming, of, the, bastille, on, 14, july, led, to, a, series, of, radical, measures, by, the, assembly, among, them, the, abolition, of, feudalism, state, control, over, the, catholic, church, in, france, and, a, declaration, of, rights, the, next, three, years, were, dominated, by, the, struggle, for, political, control, exacerbated, by, economic, depression, military, defeats, following, the, outbreak, of, the, french, revolutionary, wars, in, april, 1792, resulted, in, the, insurrection, of, 10, august, 1792, the, monarchy, was, replaced, by, the, french, first, republic, in, september, while, louis, xvi, was, executed, in, january, 1793, after, another, revolt, in, june, 1793, the, constitution, was, suspended, and, adequate, political, power, passed, from, the, national, convention, to, the, committee, of, public, safety, about, 16, 000, people, were, executed, in, a, reign, of, terror, which, ended, in, july, 1794, weakened, by, external, threats, and, internal, opposition, the, republic, was, replaced, in, 1795, by, the, directory, four, years, later, in, 1799, the, consulate, seized, power, in, a, military, coup, led, by, napoleon, bonaparte, this, is, generally, seen, as, marking, the, end, of, the, revolutionary, period, the, revolution, resulted, from, multiple, long, term, and, short, term, factors, culminating, in, a, social, economic, financial, and, political, crisis, in, the, late, 1780s, combined, with, resistance, to, reform, by, the, ruling, elite, and, indecisive, policy, by, louis, xvi, and, his, ministers, the, state, was, unable, to, manage, the, crisis, between, 1715, and, 1789, the, french, population, grew, from, 21, to, 28, million, the, proportion, of, the, population, living, in, towns, increased, to, 20, and, paris, alone, had, over, 600, 000, inhabitants, peasants, comprised, about, 80, of, the, population, but, the, middle, classes, tripled, over, the, century, reaching, almost, 10, of, the, population, by, 1789, although, the, 18th, century, was, a, period, of, increasing, prosperity, the, benefits, were, distributed, unevenly, across, regions, and, social, groups, those, whose, income, derived, from, agriculture, rents, interest, and, trade, in, goods, from, france, s, slave, colonies, benefited, most, in, contrast, the, living, standards, of, wage, labourers, and, farmers, on, rented, land, fell, increasing, inequality, led, to, more, social, conflict, economic, recession, from, 1785, and, bad, harvests, in, 1787, and, 1788, led, to, high, unemployment, and, food, prices, which, coincided, with, a, financial, and, political, crisis, for, the, monarchy, while, the, state, also, experienced, a, debt, crisis, the, level, of, debt, itself, was, not, high, compared, with, britain, s, a, significant, problem, was, that, tax, rates, varied, widely, from, one, region, to, another, were, often, different, from, the, official, amounts, and, collected, inconsistently, its, complexity, meant, uncertainty, over, the, amount, any, authorised, tax, contributed, and, caused, resentment, among, all, taxpayers, attempts, to, simplify, the, system, were, blocked, by, the, regional, parlements, which, approved, financial, policy, the, resulting, impasse, led, to, the, calling, of, the, estates, general, which, became, radicalised, by, the, struggle, for, control, of, public, finances, louis, xvi, was, willing, to, consider, reforms, but, often, backed, down, when, faced, with, opposition, from, conservative, elements, within, the, nobility, enlightenment, critiques, of, social, institutions, were, widely, discussed, among, the, educated, french, elite, at, the, same, time, the, american, revolution, and, the, european, revolts, of, the, 1780s, inspired, public, debate, on, issues, such, as, patriotism, liberty, equality, and, the, participation, of, the, people, in, making, laws, these, debates, helped, shape, the, response, of, the, educated, public, to, the, crisis, facing, the, state, a, series, of, public, scandals, such, as, the, diamond, necklace, affair, also, fuelled, widespread, anger, at, the, court, nobility, and, church, officials, the, monarchy, faced, a, series, of, budgetary, crises, during, the, 18th, century, as, revenues, failed, to, keep, pace, with, expenditure, on, the, military, and, state, pensions, although, the, french, economy, grew, solidly, the, tax, system, did, not, capture, the, new, wealth, tax, collection, was, contracted, to, tax, farmers, and, receivers, who, often, kept, much, of, the, tax, collected, as, personal, profit, as, the, nobility, and, church, benefited, from, many, exemptions, the, tax, burden, fell, mainly, on, peasants, reform, was, difficult, because, new, tax, laws, had, to, be, registered, with, regional, judicial, bodies, known, as, parlements, that, could, deny, registration, if, the, laws, conflicted, with, existing, rights, and, privileges, the, king, could, impose, laws, by, decree, but, this, risked, open, conflict, with, the, parlements, the, nobility, and, those, subject, to, new, taxes, france, primarily, funded, the, anglo, french, war, of, 1778, 1783, through, loans, following, the, peace, the, monarchy, borrowed, heavily, culminating, in, a, debt, crisis, by, 1788, half, of, state, revenue, was, required, to, service, its, debt, in, 1786, the, french, finance, minister, calonne, proposed, a, package, of, reforms, including, a, universal, land, tax, the, abolition, of, grain, controls, and, internal, tariffs, and, new, provincial, assemblies, appointed, by, the, king, the, new, taxes, however, were, rejected, first, by, a, hand, picked, assembly, of, notables, dominated, by, the, nobility, then, by, the, parlements, when, submitted, by, calonne, s, successor, brienne, the, notables, and, parlements, argued, that, the, proposed, taxes, could, only, be, approved, by, an, estates, general, a, representative, body, that, had, last, met, in, 1614, the, conflict, between, the, crown, and, the, parlements, became, a, national, political, crisis, both, sides, issued, a, series, of, public, statements, the, government, arguing, that, it, was, combating, privilege, and, the, parlement, defending, the, ancient, rights, of, the, nation, public, opinion, was, firmly, on, the, side, of, the, parlements, and, riots, broke, out, in, several, towns, brienne, s, attempts, to, raise, new, loans, failed, and, on, 8, august, 1788, he, announced, that, the, king, would, summon, an, estates, general, to, convene, the, following, may, brienne, resigned, and, was, replaced, by, necker, in, september, 1788, the, parlement, of, paris, ruled, that, the, estates, general, should, convene, in, the, same, form, as, in, 1614, meaning, that, the, three, estates, the, clergy, nobility, and, third, estate, or, commons, would, meet, and, vote, separately, with, votes, counted, by, estate, rather, than, by, head, as, a, result, the, clergy, and, nobility, could, combine, to, outvote, the, third, estate, despite, representing, less, than, 5, of, the, population, following, the, relaxation, of, censorship, and, laws, against, political, clubs, a, group, of, liberal, nobles, and, middle, class, activists, known, as, the, society, of, thirty, launched, a, campaign, for, the, doubling, of, third, estate, representation, and, voting, by, head, the, public, debate, saw, an, average, of, 25, new, political, pamphlets, published, a, week, from, 25, september, 1788, the, abb, siey, s, issued, influential, pamphlets, denouncing, the, privilege, of, the, clergy, and, nobility, and, arguing, that, the, third, estate, represented, the, nation, and, should, sit, alone, as, a, national, assembly, activists, such, as, mounier, barnave, and, robespierre, organised, meetings, petitions, and, literature, on, behalf, of, the, third, estate, in, regional, towns, in, december, the, king, agreed, to, double, the, representation, of, the, third, estate, but, left, the, question, of, counting, votes, by, head, for, the, estates, general, to, decide, the, estates, general, contained, three, separate, bodies, the, first, estate, representing, 100, 000, clergy, the, second, the, nobility, and, the, third, the, commons, since, each, met, separately, and, any, proposals, had, to, be, approved, by, at, least, two, the, first, and, second, estates, could, outvote, the, third, despite, representing, less, than, 5, of, the, population, although, the, catholic, church, in, france, owned, nearly, 10, of, all, land, as, well, as, receiving, annual, tithes, paid, by, peasants, three, quarters, of, the, 303, clergy, elected, were, parish, priests, many, of, whom, earned, less, than, unskilled, labourers, and, had, more, in, common, with, their, poor, parishioners, than, with, the, bishops, of, the, first, estate, the, second, estate, elected, 322, deputies, representing, about, 400, 000, men, and, women, who, owned, about, 25, of, the, land, and, collected, seigneurial, dues, and, rents, from, their, tenants, most, delegates, were, town, dwelling, members, of, the, noblesse, d, p, e, or, traditional, aristocracy, courtiers, and, representatives, of, the, noblesse, de, robe, those, who, derived, rank, from, judicial, or, administrative, posts, were, underrepresented, of, the, 610, deputies, of, the, third, estate, about, two, thirds, held, legal, qualifications, and, almost, half, were, venal, office, holders, less, than, 100, were, in, trade, or, industry, and, none, were, peasants, or, artisans, to, assist, delegates, each, region, completed, a, list, of, grievances, known, as, cahiers, de, dol, ances, tax, inequality, and, seigneurial, dues, feudal, payments, owed, to, landowners, headed, the, grievances, in, the, cahiers, de, doleances, for, the, estate, on, 5, may, 1789, the, estates, general, convened, at, versailles, necker, outlined, the, state, budget, and, reiterated, the, king, s, decision, that, each, estate, should, decide, on, which, matters, it, would, agree, to, meet, and, vote, in, common, with, the, other, estates, on, the, following, day, each, estate, was, to, separately, verify, the, credentials, of, their, representatives, the, third, estate, however, voted, to, invite, the, other, estates, to, join, them, in, verifying, all, the, representatives, of, the, estates, general, in, common, and, to, agree, that, votes, should, be, counted, by, head, fruitless, negotiations, lasted, to, 12, june, when, the, third, estate, began, verifying, its, own, members, on, 17, june, the, third, estate, declared, itself, to, be, the, national, assembly, of, france, and, that, all, existing, taxes, were, illegal, within, two, days, more, than, 100, members, of, the, clergy, had, joined, them, shaken, by, this, challenge, to, his, authority, the, king, agreed, to, a, reform, package, that, he, would, announce, at, a, royal, session, of, the, estates, general, the, salle, des, tats, was, closed, to, prepare, for, the, joint, session, but, the, members, of, the, estates, general, were, not, informed, in, advance, on, 20, june, when, the, members, of, the, third, estate, found, their, meeting, place, closed, they, moved, to, a, nearby, tennis, court, and, swore, not, to, disperse, until, a, new, constitution, had, been, agreed, at, the, royal, session, the, king, announced, a, series, of, tax, and, other, reforms, and, stated, that, no, new, taxes, or, loans, would, be, implemented, without, the, consent, of, the, estates, general, however, he, stated, that, the, three, estates, were, sacrosanct, and, it, was, up, to, each, estate, to, agree, to, end, their, privileges, and, decide, on, which, matters, they, would, vote, in, common, with, the, other, estates, at, the, end, of, the, session, the, third, estate, refused, to, leave, the, hall, and, reiterated, their, oath, not, to, disperse, until, a, constitution, had, been, agreed, over, the, next, days, more, members, of, the, clergy, joined, the, national, assembly, on, 27, june, faced, with, popular, demonstrations, and, mutinies, in, his, french, guards, louis, xvi, capitulated, he, commanded, the, members, of, the, first, and, second, estates, to, join, the, third, in, the, national, assembly, even, the, limited, reforms, the, king, had, announced, went, too, far, for, marie, antoinette, and, louis, younger, brother, the, comte, d, artois, on, their, advice, louis, dismissed, necker, again, as, chief, minister, on, 11, july, on, 12, july, the, assembly, went, into, a, non, stop, session, after, rumours, circulated, he, was, planning, to, use, the, swiss, guards, to, force, it, to, close, the, news, brought, crowds, of, protestors, into, the, streets, and, soldiers, of, the, elite, gardes, fran, aises, regiment, refused, to, disperse, them, on, the, 14th, many, of, these, soldiers, joined, the, mob, in, attacking, the, bastille, a, royal, fortress, with, large, stores, of, arms, and, ammunition, its, governor, bernard, ren, de, launay, surrendered, after, several, hours, of, fighting, that, cost, the, lives, of, 83, attackers, taken, to, the, h, tel, de, ville, he, was, executed, his, head, placed, on, a, pike, and, paraded, around, the, city, the, fortress, was, then, torn, down, in, a, remarkably, short, time, although, rumoured, to, hold, many, prisoners, the, bastille, held, only, seven, four, forgers, a, lunatic, a, failed, assassin, and, a, deviant, nobleman, nevertheless, as, a, potent, symbol, of, the, ancien, r, gime, its, destruction, was, viewed, as, a, triumph, and, bastille, day, is, still, celebrated, every, year, in, french, culture, some, see, its, fall, as, the, start, of, the, revolution, alarmed, by, the, prospect, of, losing, control, of, the, capital, louis, appointed, the, marquis, de, lafayette, commander, of, the, national, guard, with, jean, sylvain, bailly, as, head, of, a, new, administrative, structure, known, as, the, commune, on, 17, july, louis, visited, paris, accompanied, by, 100, deputies, where, he, was, greeted, by, bailly, and, accepted, a, tricolore, cockade, to, loud, cheers, however, it, was, clear, power, had, shifted, from, his, court, he, was, welcomed, as, louis, xvi, father, of, the, french, and, king, of, a, free, people, the, short, lived, unity, enforced, on, the, assembly, by, a, common, threat, quickly, dissipated, deputies, argued, over, constitutional, forms, while, civil, authority, rapidly, deteriorated, on, 22, july, former, finance, minister, joseph, foullon, and, his, son, were, lynched, by, a, parisian, mob, and, neither, bailly, nor, lafayette, could, prevent, it, in, rural, areas, wild, rumours, and, paranoia, resulted, in, the, formation, of, militia, and, an, agrarian, insurrection, known, as, la, grande, peur, the, breakdown, of, law, and, order, and, frequent, attacks, on, aristocratic, property, led, much, of, the, nobility, to, flee, abroad, these, migr, s, funded, reactionary, forces, within, france, and, urged, foreign, monarchs, to, back, a, counter, revolution, in, response, the, assembly, published, the, august, decrees, which, abolished, feudalism, over, 25, of, french, farmland, was, subject, to, feudal, dues, providing, the, nobility, with, most, of, their, income, these, were, now, cancelled, along, with, church, tithes, while, their, former, tenants, were, supposed, to, pay, them, compensation, collecting, it, proved, impossible, and, the, obligation, was, annulled, in, 1793, other, decrees, included, equality, before, the, law, opening, public, office, to, all, freedom, of, worship, and, cancellation, of, special, privileges, held, by, provinces, and, towns, with, the, suspension, of, the, 13, regional, parlements, in, november, the, key, institutional, pillars, of, the, old, regime, had, all, been, abolished, in, less, than, four, months, from, its, early, stages, the, revolution, therefore, displayed, signs, of, its, radical, nature, what, remained, unclear, was, the, constitutional, mechanism, for, turning, intentions, into, practical, applications, on, 9, july, the, national, assembly, appointed, a, committee, to, draft, a, constitution, and, statement, of, rights, twenty, drafts, were, submitted, which, were, used, by, a, sub, committee, to, create, a, declaration, of, the, rights, of, man, and, of, the, citizen, with, mirabeau, being, the, most, prominent, member, the, declaration, was, approved, by, the, assembly, and, published, on, 26, august, as, a, statement, of, principle, the, assembly, now, concentrated, on, the, constitution, itself, mounier, and, his, monarchist, supporters, advocated, a, bicameral, system, with, an, upper, house, appointed, by, the, king, who, would, also, have, the, right, to, appoint, ministers, and, veto, legislation, on, 10, september, the, majority, of, the, assembly, led, by, siey, s, and, talleyrand, voted, in, favour, of, a, single, body, and, the, following, day, approved, a, suspensive, veto, for, the, king, meaning, louis, could, delay, implementation, of, a, law, but, not, block, it, indefinitely, in, october, the, assembly, voted, to, restrict, political, rights, including, voting, rights, to, active, citizens, defined, as, french, males, over, the, age, of, 25, who, paid, direct, taxes, equal, to, three, days, labour, the, remainder, were, designated, passive, citizens, restricted, to, civil, rights, a, distinction, opposed, by, a, significant, minority, including, the, jacobin, clubs, by, mid, 1790, the, main, elements, of, a, constitutional, monarchy, were, in, place, although, the, constitution, was, not, accepted, by, louis, until, 1791, food, shortages, and, the, worsening, economy, caused, frustration, at, the, lack, of, progress, and, led, to, popular, unrest, in, paris, this, came, to, a, head, in, late, september, 1789, when, the, flanders, regiment, arrived, in, versailles, to, reinforce, the, royal, bodyguard, and, were, welcomed, with, a, formal, banquet, as, was, common, practice, the, radical, press, described, this, as, a, gluttonous, orgy, and, claimed, the, tricolour, cockade, had, been, abused, while, the, assembly, viewed, their, arrival, as, an, attempt, to, intimidate, them, on, 5, october, crowds, of, women, assembled, outside, the, h, tel, de, ville, agitating, against, high, food, prices, and, shortages, these, protests, quickly, turned, political, and, after, seizing, weapons, stored, at, the, h, tel, de, ville, some, 7, 000, of, them, marched, on, versailles, where, they, entered, the, assembly, to, present, their, demands, they, were, followed, to, versailles, by, 15, 000, members, of, the, national, guard, under, lafayette, who, was, virtually, a, prisoner, of, his, own, troops, when, the, national, guard, arrived, later, that, evening, lafayette, persuaded, louis, the, safety, of, his, family, required, their, relocation, to, paris, next, morning, some, of, the, protestors, broke, into, the, royal, apartments, searching, for, marie, antoinette, who, escaped, they, ransacked, the, palace, killing, several, guards, order, was, eventually, restored, and, the, royal, family, and, assembly, left, for, paris, escorted, by, the, national, guard, louis, had, announced, his, acceptance, of, the, august, decrees, and, the, declaration, and, his, official, title, changed, from, king, of, france, to, king, of, the, french, historian, john, mcmanners, argues, in, eighteenth, century, france, throne, and, altar, were, commonly, spoken, of, as, in, close, alliance, their, simultaneous, collapse, would, one, day, provide, the, final, proof, of, their, interdependence, one, suggestion, is, that, after, a, century, of, persecution, some, french, protestants, actively, supported, an, anti, catholic, regime, a, resentment, fuelled, by, enlightenment, thinkers, such, as, voltaire, jean, jacques, rousseau, considered, a, philosophical, founder, of, the, revolution, wrote, it, was, manifestly, contrary, to, the, law, of, nature, that, a, handful, of, people, should, gorge, themselves, with, superfluities, while, the, hungry, multitude, goes, in, want, of, necessities, the, revolution, caused, a, massive, shift, of, power, from, the, catholic, church, to, the, state, although, the, extent, of, religious, belief, has, been, questioned, elimination, of, tolerance, for, religious, minorities, meant, by, 1789, being, french, also, meant, being, catholic, the, church, was, the, largest, individual, landowner, in, france, controlling, nearly, 10, of, all, estates, and, levied, tithes, effectively, a, 10, tax, on, income, collected, from, peasant, farmers, in, the, form, of, crops, in, return, it, provided, a, minimal, level, of, social, support, the, august, decrees, abolished, tithes, and, on, 2, november, the, assembly, confiscated, all, church, property, the, value, of, which, was, used, to, back, a, new, paper, currency, known, as, assignats, in, return, the, state, assumed, responsibilities, such, as, paying, the, clergy, and, caring, for, the, poor, the, sick, and, the, orphaned, on, 13, february, 1790, religious, orders, and, monasteries, were, dissolved, while, monks, and, nuns, were, encouraged, to, return, to, private, life, the, civil, constitution, of, the, clergy, of, 12, july, 1790, made, them, employees, of, the, state, as, well, as, establishing, rates, of, pay, and, a, system, for, electing, priests, and, bishops, pope, pius, vi, and, many, french, catholics, objected, to, this, since, it, denied, the, authority, of, the, pope, over, the, french, church, in, october, thirty, bishops, wrote, a, declaration, denouncing, the, law, further, fuelling, opposition, when, clergy, were, required, to, swear, loyalty, to, the, civil, constitution, in, november, 1790, it, split, the, church, between, the, 24, who, complied, and, the, majority, who, refused, this, stiffened, popular, resistance, against, state, interference, especially, in, traditionally, catholic, areas, such, as, normandy, brittany, and, the, vend, e, where, only, a, few, priests, took, the, oath, and, the, civilian, population, turned, against, the, revolution, the, result, was, state, led, persecution, of, refractory, clergy, many, of, whom, were, forced, into, exile, deported, or, executed, the, period, from, october, 1789, to, spring, 1791, is, usually, seen, as, one, of, relative, tranquility, when, some, of, the, most, important, legislative, reforms, were, enacted, however, conflict, over, the, source, of, legitimate, authority, was, more, apparent, in, the, provinces, where, officers, of, the, ancien, r, gime, had, been, swept, away, but, not, yet, replaced, by, new, structures, this, was, less, obvious, in, paris, since, the, national, guard, made, it, the, best, policed, city, in, europe, but, disorder, in, the, provinces, inevitably, affected, members, of, the, assembly, centrists, led, by, siey, s, lafayette, mirabeau, and, bailly, created, a, majority, by, forging, consensus, with, monarchiens, like, mounier, and, independents, including, adrien, duport, barnave, and, alexandre, lameth, at, one, end, of, the, political, spectrum, reactionaries, like, cazal, s, and, maury, denounced, the, revolution, in, all, its, forms, with, radicals, like, maximilien, robespierre, at, the, other, he, and, jean, paul, marat, opposed, the, criteria, for, active, citizens, gaining, them, substantial, support, among, the, parisian, proletariat, many, of, whom, had, been, disenfranchised, by, the, measure, on, 14, july, 1790, celebrations, were, held, throughout, france, commemorating, the, fall, of, the, bastille, with, participants, swearing, an, oath, of, fidelity, to, the, nation, the, law, and, the, king, the, f, te, de, la, f, d, ration, in, paris, was, attended, by, the, royal, family, with, talleyrand, performing, a, mass, despite, this, show, of, unity, the, assembly, was, increasingly, divided, while, external, players, like, the, paris, commune, and, national, guard, competed, for, power, one, of, the, most, significant, was, the, jacobin, club, originally, a, forum, for, general, debate, by, august, 1790, it, had, over, 150, members, split, into, different, factions, the, assembly, continued, to, develop, new, institutions, in, september, 1790, the, regional, parlements, were, abolished, and, their, legal, functions, replaced, by, a, new, independent, judiciary, with, jury, trials, for, criminal, cases, however, moderate, deputies, were, uneasy, at, popular, demands, for, universal, suffrage, labour, unions, and, cheap, bread, and, over, the, winter, of, 1790, and, 1791, they, passed, a, series, of, measures, intended, to, disarm, popular, radicalism, these, included, exclusion, of, poorer, citizens, from, the, national, guard, limits, on, use, of, petitions, and, posters, and, the, june, 1791, le, chapelier, law, suppressing, trade, guilds, and, any, form, of, worker, organisation, the, traditional, force, for, preserving, law, and, order, was, the, army,

mutiny, at, nancy, although, congratulated, by, the, assembly, he, was, criticised, by, jacobin, radicals, for, the, severity, of, his, actions, growing, disorder, meant, many, professional, officers, either, left, or, became, migr, s, further, destabilising, the, institution, held, in, the, tuileries, palace, under, virtual, house, arrest, louis, xvi, was, urged, by, his, brother, and, wife, to, re, assert, his, independence, by, taking, refuge, with, bouill, who, was, based, at, montm, dy, with, 10, 000, soldiers, considered, loyal, to, the, crown, the, royal, family, left, the, palace, in, disguise, on, the, night, of, 20, june, 1791, late, the, next, day, louis, was, recognised, as, he, passed, through, varennes, arrested, and, taken, back, to, paris, the, attempted, escape, had, a, profound, impact, on, public, opinion, since, it, was, clear, louis, had, been, seeking, refuge, in, austria, the, assembly, now, demanded, oaths, of, loyalty, to, the, regime, and, began, preparing, for, war, while, fear, of, spies, and, traitors, became, pervasive, despite, calls, to, replace, the, monarchy, with, a, republic, louis, retained, his, position, but, was, generally, regarded, with, acute, suspicion, and, forced, to, swear, allegiance, to, the, constitution, a, new, decree, stated, retracting, this, oath, making, war, upon, the, nation, or, permitting, anyone, to, do, so, in, his, name, would, be, considered, abdication, however, radicals, led, by, jacques, pierre, brissot, prepared, a, petition, demanding, his, deposition, and, on, 17, july, an, immense, crowd, gathered, in, the, champ, de, mars, to, sign, led, by, lafayette, the, national, guard, was, ordered, to, preserve, public, order, and, responded, to, a, barrage, of, stones, by, firing, into, the, crowd, killing, between, 13, and, 50, people, the, massacre, badly, damaged, lafayette, s, reputation, the, authorities, responded, by, closing, radical, clubs, and, newspapers, while, their, leaders, went, into, exile, or, hiding, including, marat, on, 27, august, emperor, leopold, ii, and, king, frederick, william, ii, of, prussia, issued, the, declaration, of, pillnitz, declaring, their, support, for, louis, and, hinting, at, an, invasion, of, france, on, his, behalf, in, reality, the, meeting, between, leopold, and, frederick, was, primarily, to, discuss, the, partitions, of, poland, the, declaration, was, intended, to, satisfy, comte, d, artois, and, other, french, migr, s, but, the, threat, rallied, popular, support, behind, the, regime, based, on, a, motion, proposed, by, robespierre, existing, deputies, were, barred, from, elections, held, in, early, september, for, the, french, legislative, assembly, although, robespierre, himself, was, one, of, those, excluded, his, support, in, the, clubs, gave, him, a, political, power, base, not, available, to, lafayette, and, bailly, who, resigned, respectively, as, head, of, the, national, guard, and, the, paris, commune, the, new, laws, were, gathered, together, in, the, 1791, constitution, and, submitted, to, louis, xvi, who, pledged, to, defend, it, from, enemies, at, home, and, abroad, on, 30, september, the, constituent, assembly, was, dissolved, and, the, legislative, assembly, convened, the, next, day, the, legislative, assembly, is, often, dismissed, by, historians, as, an, ineffective, body, compromised, by, divisions, over, the, role, of, the, monarchy, an, issue, exacerbated, when, louis, attempted, to, prevent, or, reverse, limitations, on, his, powers, at, the, same, time, restricting, the, vote, to, those, who, paid, a, minimal, amount, of, tax, disenfranchised, a, significant, proportion, of, the, 6, million, frenchmen, over, 25, while, only, 10, of, those, able, to, vote, actually, did, so, finally, poor, harvests, and, rising, food, prices, led, to, unrest, among, the, urban, class, known, as, sans, culottes, who, saw, the, new, regime, as, failing, to, meet, their, demands, for, bread, and, work, this, meant, the, new, constitution, was, opposed, by, significant, elements, inside, and, outside, the, assembly, itself, split, into, three, main, groups, 264, members, were, affiliated, with, barnave, s, feuillants, constitutional, monarchists, who, considered, the, revolution, had, gone, far, enough, while, another, 136, were, jacobin, leftists, who, supported, a, republic, led, by, brissot, and, usually, referred, to, as, brissotins, the, remaining, 345, belonged, to, la, plaine, a, centrist, faction, who, switched, votes, depending, on, the, issue, but, many, of, whom, shared, doubts, as, to, whether, louis, was, committed, to, the, revolution, after, he, officially, accepted, the, new, constitution, one, recorded, response, was, vive, le, roi, s, il, est, de, bon, foi, or, long, live, the, king, if, he, keeps, his, word, although, a, minority, in, the, assembly, control, of, key, committees, allowed, the, brissotins, to, provoke, louis, into, using, his, veto, they, first, managed, to, pass, decrees, confiscating, migr, property, and, threatening, them, with, the, death, penalty, this, was, followed, by, measures, against, non, juring, priests, whose, opposition, to, the, civil, constitution, led, to, a, state, of, near, civil, war, in, southern, france, which, barnave, tried, to, defuse, by, relaxing, the, more, punitive, provisions, on, 29, november, the, assembly, approved, a, decree, giving, refractory, clergy, eight, days, to, comply, or, face, charges, of, conspiracy, against, the, nation, an, act, opposed, even, by, robespierre, when, louis, vetoed, both, his, opponents, were, able, to, portray, him, as, opposed, to, reform, in, general, brissot, accompanied, this, with, a, campaign, for, war, against, austria, and, prussia, often, interpreted, as, a, mixture, of, calculation, and, idealism, while, exploiting, popular, anti, austrianism, it, reflected, a, genuine, belief, in, exporting, the, values, of, political, liberty, and, popular, sovereignty, simultaneously, conservatives, headed, by, marie, antoinette, also, favoured, war, seeing, it, as, a, way, to, regain, control, of, the, military, and, restore, royal, authority, in, december, 1791, louis, made, a, speech, in, the, assembly, giving, foreign, powers, a, month, to, disband, the, migr, s, or, face, war, an, act, greeted, with, enthusiasm, by, supporters, but, suspicion, from, opponents, barnave, s, inability, to, build, a, consensus, in, the, assembly, resulted, in, the, appointment, of, a, new, government, chiefly, composed, of, brissotins, on, 20, april, 1792, the, french, revolutionary, wars, began, when, french, armies, attacked, austrian, and, prussian, forces, along, their, borders, before, suffering, a, series, of, disastrous, defeats, in, an, effort, to, mobilise, popular, support, the, government, ordered, non, juring, priests, to, swear, the, oath, or, be, deported, dissolved, the, constitutional, guard, and, replaced, it, with, 20, 000, f, d, r, s, louis, agreed, to, disband, the, guard, but, vetoed, the, other, two, proposals, while, lafayette, called, on, the, assembly, to, suppress, the, clubs, popular, anger, increased, when, details, of, the, brunswick, manifesto, reached, paris, on, 1, august, threatening, unforgettable, vengeance, should, any, oppose, the, allies, in, seeking, to, restore, the, power, of, the, monarchy, on, the, morning, of, 10, august, a, combined, force, of, the, paris, national, guard, and, provincial, f, d, r, s, attacked, the, tuileries, palace, killing, many, of, the, swiss, guards, protecting, it, louis, and, his, family, took, refuge, with, the, assembly, and, shortly, after, 11, 00, am, the, deputies, present, voted, to, temporarily, relieve, the, king, effectively, suspending, the, monarchy, in, late, august, elections, were, held, for, the, national, convention, new, restrictions, on, the, franchise, meant, the, number, of, votes, cast, fell, to, 3, 3, million, versus, 4, million, in, 1791, while, intimidation, was, widespread, the, brissotins, now, split, between, moderate, girondins, led, by, brissot, and, radical, montagnards, headed, by, robespierre, georges, danton, and, jean, paul, marat, while, loyalties, constantly, shifted, voting, patterns, suggest, roughly, 160, of, the, 749, deputies, can, generally, be, categorised, as, girondists, with, another, 200, montagnards, the, remainder, were, part, of, a, centrist, faction, known, as, la, plaine, headed, by, bertrand, bar, re, pierre, joseph, cambon, and, lazare, carnot, in, the, september, massacres, between, 1, 100, and, 1, 600, prisoners, held, in, parisian, jails, were, summarily, executed, the, vast, majority, being, common, criminals, a, response, to, the, capture, of, longwy, and, verdun, by, prussia, the, perpetrators, were, largely, national, guard, members, and, f, d, r, s, on, their, way, to, the, front, while, responsibility, is, still, disputed, even, moderates, expressed, sympathy, for, the, action, which, soon, spread, to, the, provinces, one, suggestion, is, that, the, killings, stemmed, from, concern, over, growing, lawlessness, rather, than, political, ideology, on, 20, september, the, french, defeated, the, prussians, at, the, battle, of, valmy, in, what, was, the, first, major, victory, by, the, army, of, france, during, the, revolutionary, wars, emboldened, by, this, on, 22, september, the, convention, replaced, the, monarchy, with, the, french, first, republic, 1792, 1804, and, introduced, a, new, calendar, with, 1792, becoming, year, one, the, next, few, months, were, taken, up, with, the, trial, of, citoyen, louis, capet, formerly, louis, xvi, while, evenly, divided, on, the, question, of, his, guilt, members, of, the, convention, were, increasingly, influenced, by, radicals, based, within, the, jacobin, clubs, and, paris, commune, the, brunswick, manifesto, made, it, easy, to, portray, louis, as, a, threat, to, the, revolution, especially, when, extracts, from, his, personal, correspondence, showed, him, conspiring, with, royalist, exiles, on, 17, january, 1793, louis, was, sentenced, to, death, for, conspiracy, against, public, liberty, and, general, safety, 361, deputies, were, in, favour, 288, against, while, another, 72, voted, to, execute, him, subject, to, delaying, conditions, the, sentence, was, carried, out, on, 21, january, on, the, place, de, la, r, volution, now, the, place, de, la, concorde, conservatives, across, europe, now, called, for, the, destruction, of, revolutionary, france, and, in, february, the, convention, responded, by, declaring, war, on, britain, and, the, dutch, republic, together, with, austria, and, prussia, these, two, countries, were, later, joined, by, spain, portugal, naples, and, tuscany, in, the, war, of, the, first, coalition, 1792, 1797, the, girondins, hoped, war, would, unite, the, people, behind, the, government, and, provide, an, excuse, for, rising, prices, and, food, shortages, but, found, themselves, the, target, of, popular, anger, many, left, for, the, provinces, the, first, conscription, measure, or, lev, e,

republic, seemed, on, the, verge, of, collapse, the, crisis, led, to, the, creation, on, 6, april, 1793, of, the, committee, of, public, safety, an, executive, committee, accountable, to, the, convention, the, girondins, made, a, fatal, political, error, by, indicting, marat, before, the, revolutionary, tribunal, for, allegedly, directing, the, september, massacres, he, was, quickly, acquitted, further, isolating, the, girondins, from, the, sans, culottes, when, jacques, h, bert, called, for, a, popular, revolt, against, the, henchmen, of, louis, capet, on, 24, may, he, was, arrested, by, the, commission, of, twelve, a, girondin, dominated, tribunal, set, up, to, expose, plots, in, response, to, protests, by, the, commune, the, commission, warned, if, by, your, incessant,

commune, and, elements, of, the, national, guard, on, 31, may, they, attempted, to, seize, power, in, a, coup, although, the, coup, failed, on, 2, june, the, convention, was, surrounded, by, a, crowd, of, up, to, 80, 000, demanding, cheap, bread, unemployment, pay, and, political, reforms, including, restriction, of, the, vote, to, the, sans, culottes, and, the, right, to, remove, deputies, at, will, ten, members, of, the, commission, and, another, twenty, nine, members, of, the, girondin, faction, were, arrested, and, on, 10, june, the, montagnards, took, over, the, committee, of, public, safety, meanwhile, a, committee, led, by, robespierre, s, close, ally, saint, just, was, tasked, with, preparing, a, new, constitution, completed, in, only, eight, days, it, was, ratified, by, the, convention, on, 24, june, and, contained, radical, reforms, including, universal, male, suffrage, however, normal, legal, processes, were, suspended, following, the, assassination, of, marat, on, 13, july, by, the, girondist, charlotte, corday, which, the, committee, of, public, safety, used, as, an, excuse, to, take, control, the, 1793, constitution, was, suspended, indefinitely, in, october,

opponents, while, areas, like, the, vend, e, and, brittany, wanted, to, restore, the, monarchy, most, supported, the, republic, but, opposed, the, regime, in, paris, on, 17, august, the, convention, voted, a, second, lev, e, en, masse, despite, initial, problems, in, equipping, and, supplying, such, large, numbers, by, mid, october, republican, forces, had, re, taken, lyon, marseilles, and, bordeaux, while, defeating, coalition, armies, at, hondschoote, and, wattignies, the, new, class, of, military, leaders, included, a, young, colonel, named, napoleon, bonaparte, who, was, appointed, commander, of, artillery, at, the, siege, of, toulon, thanks, to, his, friendship, with, augustin, robespierre, his, success, in, that, role, resulted, in, promotion, to, the, army, of, italy, in, april, 1794, and, the, beginning, of, his, rise, to, military, and, political, power, although, intended, to, bolster, revolutionary, fervour, the, reign, of, terror, rapidly, degenerated, into, the, settlement, of, personal, grievances, at, the, end, of, july, the, convention, set, price, controls, on, a, wide, range, of, goods, with, the, death, penalty, for, hoarders, on, 9, september, revolutionary, groups, were, established, to, enforce, these, controls, while, the, law, of, suspects, on, 17th, approved, the, arrest, of, suspected, enemies, of, freedom, this, initiated, what, has, become, known, as, the, terror, from, september, 1793, to, july, 1794, around, 300, 000, were, arrested, with, some, 16, 600, people, executed, on, charges, of, counter, revolutionary, activity,

however, few, would, buy, assets, that, might, be, repossessed, by, their, former, owners, a, concern, that, could, only, be, achieved, by, military, victory, this, meant, the, financial, position, worsened, as, threats, to, the, republic, increased, while, printing, assignats, to, deal, with, the, deficit, further, increased, inflation, on, 10, october, the, convention, recognised, the, committee, of, public, safety, as, the, supreme, revolutionary, government, and, suspended, the, constitution, until, peace, was, achieved, in, mid, october, marie, antoinette, was, convicted, of, a, long, list, of, crimes, and, guillotined, two, weeks, later, the, girondist, leaders, arrested, in, june, were, also, executed, along, with, philippe, galit, the, terror, was, not, confined, to, paris, with, over, 2, 000, killed, in, lyons, after, its, recapture, at, cholet, on, 17, october, the, republican, army, won, a, decisive, victory, over, the, vend, e, rebels, and, the, survivors,

repression, that, followed, has, been, debated, by, french, historians, since, the, mid, 19th, century, between, november, 1793, to, february, 1794, over, 4, 000, were, drowned, in, the, loire, at, nantes, under, the, supervision, of, jean, baptiste, carrier, historian, reynald, secher, claims, that, as, many, as, 117, 000, died, between, 1793, and, 1796, although, those, numbers, have, been,

may, 1795, revolt, relieved, of, pressure, from, below, the, jacobin, clubs, became, supporters, of, the, directory, largely, to, prevent, restoration, of, the, monarchy, removal, of, price, controls, and, a, collapse, in, the, value, of, the, assignat, led, to, inflation, and, soaring, food, prices, by, april, 1796, over, 500, 000, parisians, were, unemployed, resulting, in, the, may, insurrection, known, as, the, conspiracy, of, the, equals, led, by, the, revolutionary, fran, ois, no, l, babeuf, their, demands, included, immediate, implementation, of, the, 1793, constitution, and, a, more, equitable, distribution, of, wealth, despite, support, from, sections, of, the, military, the, revolt, was, easily, crushed, while, babeuf, and, other, leaders, were, executed, nevertheless, by, 1799, the, economy, had, been, stabilised, and, important, reforms, made, allowing, steady, expansion, of, french, industry, many, of, these, remained, in, place, for, much, of, the, 19th, century, prior, to, 1797, three, of, the, five, directors, were, firmly, republican, barras, r, velli, re, l, peaux, and, jean, fran, ois, rewbell, as, were, around, 40, of, the, legislature, the, same, percentage, were, broadly, centrist, or, unaffiliated, along, with, two, directors, tienne, fran, ois, letourneur, and, lazare, carnot, although, only, 20, were, committed, royalists, many, centrists, supported, the, restoration, of, the, exiled, louis, xviii, of, france, in, the, belief, this, would, bring, peace, the, elections, of, may, 1797, resulted, in, significant, gains, for, the, right, with, royalists, jean, charles, pichegru, elected, president, of, the, council, of, 500, and, barth, lemy, appointed, a, director, with, royalists, apparently, on, the, verge, of, power, republicans, attempted, a, pre, emptive, coup, on, 4, september, using, troops, from, napoleon, s, army, of, italy, under, pierre, augereau, the, council, of, 500, was, forced, to, approve, the, arrest, of, barth, lemy, pichegru, and, carnot, the, elections, were, annulled, sixty, three, leading, royalists, deported, to, french, guiana, and, new, laws, passed, against, migr, s, royalists, and, ultra, jacobins, the, removal, of, his, conservative, opponents, opened, the, way, for, direct, conflict, between, barras, and, those, on, the, left, fighting, continued, despite, general, war, weariness, and, the, 1798, elections, saw, a, resurgence, in, jacobin, strength, napoleon, s, invasion, of, egypt, in, july, 1798, confirmed, european, fears, of, french, expansionism, and, the, war, of, the, second, coalition, began, in, november, without, a, majority, in, the, legislature, the, directors, relied, on, the, army, to, enforce, decrees, and, extract, revenue, from, conquered, territories, generals, like, napoleon, and, joubert, were, now, central, to, the, political, process, while, both, the, army, and, directory, became, notorious, for, their, corruption, it, has, been, suggested, the, directory, collapsed, because, by, 1799, many, preferred, the, uncertainties, of, authoritarian, rule, to, the, continuing, ambiguities, of, parliamentary, politics, the, architect, of, its, end, was, siey, s, who, when, asked, what, he, had, done, during, the, terror, allegedly, answered, i, survived, nominated, to, the, directory, his, first, action, was, to, remove, barras, with, the, help, of, allies, including, talleyrand, and, napoleon, s, brother, lucien, president, of, the, council, of, 500, on, 9, november, 1799, the, coup, of, 18, brumaire, replaced, the, five, directors, with, the, french, consulate, which, consisted, of, three, members, napoleon, siey, s, and, roger, ducos, most, historians, consider, this, the, end, point, of, the, french, revolution, the, role, of, ideology, in, the, revolution, is, controversial, with, jonathan, israel, stating, that, the, radical, enlightenment, was, the, primary, driving, force, of, the, revolution, cobban, however, argues, he, actions, of, the, revolutionaries, were, most, often, prescribed, by, the, need, to, find, practical, solutions, to, immediate, problems, using, the, resources, at, hand, not, by, pre, conceived, theories, the, identification, of, ideologies, is, complicated, by, the, profusion, of, revolutionary, clubs, factions, and, publications, absence, of, formal, political, parties, and, individual, flexibility, in, the, face, of, changing, circumstances, in, addition, although, the, declaration, of, the, rights, of, man, was, a, fundamental, document, for, all, revolutionary, factions, its, interpretation, varied, widely, while, all, revolutionaries, professed, their, devotion, to, liberty, in, principle, it, appeared, to, mean, whatever, those, in, power, wanted, for, example, the, liberties, specified, in, the, rights, of, man, were, limited, by, law, when, they, might, cause, harm, to, others, or, be, abused, prior, to, 1792, jacobins, and, others, frequently, opposed, press, restrictions, on, the, grounds, these, violated, a, basic, right, however, the, radical, national, convention, passed, laws, in, september, 1793, and, july, 1794, imposing, the, death, penalty, for, offences, such, as, disparaging, the, national, convention, and, misleading, public, opinion, while, revolutionaries, also, endorsed, the, principle, of, equality, few, advocated, equality, of, wealth, since, property, was, also, viewed, as, a, right, the, national, assembly, opposed, equal, political, rights, for, women, while, the, abolition, of, slavery, in, the, colonies, was, delayed, until, february, 1794, because, it, conflicted, with, the, property, rights, of, slave, owners, and, many, feared, it, would, disrupt, trade, political, equality, for, male, citizens, was, another, divisive, issue, with, the, 1791, constitution, limiting, the, right, to, vote, and, stand, for, office, to, males, over, 25, who, met, a, property, qualification, so, called, active, citizens, this, restriction, was, opposed, by, many, activists, including, robespierre, the, jacobins, and, cordeliers, the, principle, that, sovereignty, resided, in, the, nation, was, a, key, concept, of, the, revolution, however, israel, argues, this, obscures, ideological, differences, over, whether, the, will, of, the, nation, was, best, expressed, through, representative, assemblies, and, constitutions, or, direct, action, by, revolutionary, crowds, and, popular, assemblies, such, as, the, sections, of, the, paris, commune, many, considered, constitutional, monarchy, as, incompatible, with, the, principle, of, popular, sovereignty, but, prior, to, 1792, there, was, a, strong, bloc, with, an, ideological, commitment, to, such, a, system, based, on, the, writings, of, hobbes, locke, montesquieu, and, voltaire, israel, argues, the, nationalisation, of, church, property, and, the, establishment, of, the, constitutional, church, reflected, an, ideological, commitment, to, secularism, and, a, determination, to, undermine, a, bastion, of, old, regime, privilege, while, cobban, agrees, the, constitutional, church, was, motivated, by, ideology, he, sees, its, origins, in, the, anti, clericalism, of, voltaire, and, other, enlightenment, figures, jacobins, were, hostile, to, formal, political, parties, and, factions, which, they, saw, as, a, threat, to, national, unity, and, the, general, will, with, political, virtue, and, love, of, country, key, elements, of, their, ideology, they, viewed, the, ideal, revolutionary, as, selfless, sincere, free, of, political, ambition, and, devoted, to, the, nation, the, disputes, leading, to, the, departure, first, of, the, feuillants, then, later, the, girondists, were, conducted, in, terms, of, the, relative, political, virtue, and, patriotism, of, the, disputants, in, december, 1793, all, members, of, the, jacobin, clubs, were, subject, to, a, purifying, scrutiny, to, determine, whether, they, were, men, of, virtue, the, revolution, initiated, a, series, of, conflicts, that, began, in, 1792, and, ended, only, with, napoleon, s, defeat, at, waterloo, in, 1815, in, its, early, stages, this, seemed, unlikely, the, 1791, constitution, specifically, disavowed, war, for, the, purpose, of, conquest, and, although, traditional, tensions, between, france, and, austria, re, emerged, in, the, 1780s, emperor, joseph, ii, cautiously, welcomed, the, reforms, austria, was, at, war, with, the, ottomans, as, were, the, russians, while, both, were, negotiating, with, prussia, over, partitioning, poland, most, importantly, britain, preferred, peace, and, as, emperor, leopold, ii, stated, after, the, declaration, of, pillnitz, without, england, there, is, no, case, in, late, 1791, factions, within, the, assembly, came, to, see, war, as, a, way, to, unite, the, country, and, secure, the, revolution, by, eliminating, hostile, forces, on, its, borders, and, establishing, its, natural, frontiers, france, declared, war, on, austria, in, april, 1792, and, issued, the, first, conscription, orders, with, recruits, serving, for, twelve, months, by, the, time, peace, finally, came, in, 1815, the, conflict, had, involved, every, major, european, power, as, well, as, the, united, states, redrawn, the, map, of, europe, and, expanded, into, the, americas, the, middle, east, and, the, indian, ocean, from, 1701, to, 1801, the, population, of, europe, grew, from, 118, to, 187, million, combined, with, new, mass, production, techniques, this, allowed, belligerents, to, support, large, armies, requiring, the, mobilisation, of, national, resources, it, was, a, different, kind, of, war, fought, by, nations, rather, than, kings, intended, to, destroy, their, opponents, ability, to, resist, but, also, to, implement, deep, ranging, social, change, while, all, wars, are, political, to, some, degree, this, period, was, remarkable, for, the, emphasis, placed, on, reshaping, boundaries, and, the, creation, of, entirely, new, european, states, in, april, 1792, french, armies, invaded, the, austrian, netherlands, but, suffered, a, series, of, setbacks, before, victory, over, an, austrian, prussian, army, at, valmy, in, september, after, defeating, a, second, austrian, army, at, jemappes, on, 6, november, they, occupied, the, netherlands, areas, of, the, rhineland, nice, and, savoy, emboldened, by, this, success, in, february, 1793, france, declared, war, on, the, dutch, republic, spain, and, britain, beginning, the, war, of, the, first, coalition, however, the, expiration, of, the, 12, month, term, for, the, 1792, recruits, forced, the, french, to, relinquish, their, conquests, in, august, new, conscription, measures, were, passed, and, by, may, 1794, the, french, army, had, between, 750, 000, and, 800, 000, men, despite, high, rates, of, desertion, this, was, large, enough, to, manage, multiple, internal, and, external, threats, for, comparison, the, combined, prussian, austrian, army, was, less, than, 90, 000, by, february, 1795, france, had, annexed, the, austrian, netherlands, established, their, frontier, on, the, left, bank, of, the, rhine, and, replaced, the, dutch, republic, with, the, batavian, republic, a, satellite, state, these, victories, led, to, the, collapse, of, the, anti, french, coalition, prussia, made, peace, in, april, 1795, followed, soon, after, by, spain, leaving, britain, and, austria, as, the, only, major, powers, still, in, the, war, in, october, 1797, a, series, of, defeats, by, bonaparte, in, italy, led, austria, to, agree, to, the, treaty, of, campo, formio, in, which, they, formally, ceded, the, netherlands, and, recognised, the, cisalpine, republic, fighting, continued, for, two, reasons, first, french, state, finances, had, come, to, rely, on, indemnities, levied, on, their, defeated, opponents, second, armies, were, primarily, loyal, to, their, generals, for, whom, the, wealth, achieved, by, victory, and, the, status, it, conferred, became, objectives, in, themselves, leading, soldiers, like, hoche, pichegru, and, carnot, wielded, significant, political, influence, and, often, set, policy, campo, formio, was, approved, by, bonaparte, not, the, directory, which, strongly, objected, to, terms, it, considered, too, lenient, despite, these, concerns, the, directory, never, developed, a, realistic, peace, programme, fearing, the, destabilising, effects, of, peace, and, the, consequent, demobilisation, of, hundreds, of, thousands, of, young, men, as, long, as, the, generals, and, their, armies, stayed, away, from, paris, they, were, happy, to, allow, them, to, continue, fighting, a, key, factor, behind, sanctioning, bonaparte, s, invasion, of, egypt, this, resulted, in, aggressive, and, opportunistic, policies, leading, to, the, war, of, the, second, coalition, in, november, 1798, in, 1789, the, most, populous, french, colonies, were, saint, domingue, today, haiti, martinique, guadeloupe, the, le, bourbon, r, union, and, the, le, de, la, france, these, colonies, produced, commodities, such, as, sugar, coffee, and, cotton, for, exclusive, export, to, france, there, were, about, 700, 000, slaves, in, the, colonies, of, which, about, 500, 000, were, in, saint, domingue, colonial, products, accounted, for, about, a, third, of, france, s, exports, in, february, 1788, the, soci, t, des, amis, des, noirs, society, of, the, friends, of, blacks, was, formed, in, france, with, the, aim, of, abolishing, slavery, in, the, empire, in, august, 1789, colonial, slave, owners, and, merchants, formed, the, rival, club, de, massiac, to, represent, their, interests, when, the, constituent, assembly, adopted, the, declaration, of, the, rights, of, man, and, of, the, citizen, in, august, 1789, delegates, representing, the, colonial, landowners, successfully, argued, that, the, principles, should, not, apply, in, the, colonies, as, they, would, bring, economic, ruin, and, disrupt, trade, colonial, landowners, also, gained, control, of, the, colonial, committee, of, the, assembly, from, where, they, exerted, a, powerful, influence, against, abolition, people, of, colour, also, faced, social, and, legal, discrimination, in, mainland, france, and, its, colonies, including, a, bar, on, their, access, to, professions, such, as, law, medicine, and, pharmacy, in, 1789, 90, a, delegation, of, free, coloureds, led, by, vincent, og, and, julien, raimond, unsuccessfully, lobbied, the, assembly, to, end, discrimination, against, free, coloureds, og, left, for, saint, domingue, where, an, uprising, against, white, landowners, broke, out, in, october, 1790, the, revolt, failed, and, og, was, killed, in, may, 1791, the, national, assembly, granted, full, political, rights, to, coloureds, born, of, two, free, parents, but, left, the, rights, of, freed, slaves, to, be, determined, by, the, colonial, assemblies, the, assemblies, refused, to, implement, the, decree, and, fighting, broke, out, between, the, coloured, population, of, saint, domingue, and, white, colonists, each, side, recruiting, slaves, to, their, forces, a, major, slave, revolt, followed, in, august, in, march, 1792, the, legislative, assembly, responded, to, the, revolt, by, granting, citizenship, to, all, free, coloureds, and, sending, two, commissioners, sonthonax, and, polv, rel, and, 6, 000, troops, to, saint, domingue, to, enforce, the, decree, on, arrival, in, september, the, commissioners, announced, that, slavery, would, remain, in, force, over, 72, 00, slaves, were, still, in, revolt, mostly, in, the, north, brissot, and, his, supporters, envisaged, an, eventual, abolition, of, slavery, but, their, immediate, concern, was, securing, trade, and, the, support, of, merchants, for, the, revolutionary, wars, after, brissot, s, fall, the, new, constitution, of, june, 1793, included, a, new, declaration, of, the, rights, of, man, and, the, citizen, but, excluded, the, colonies, from, its, provisions, in, any, event, the, new, constitution, was, suspended, until, france, was, at, peace, in, early, 1793, royalist, planters, from, guadeloupe, and, saint, domingue, formed, an, alliance, with, britain, the, spanish, supported, insurgent, slaves, led, by, jean, fran, ois, papillon, and, georges, biassou, in, the, north, of, saint, domingue, white, planters, loyal, to, the, republic, sent, representatives, to, paris, to, convince, the, jacobin, controlled, convention, that, those, calling, for, the, abolition, of, slavery, were, british, agents, and, supporters, of, brissot, hoping, to, disrupt, trade, in, june, the, commissioners, in, saint, domingue, freed, 10, 000, slaves, fighting, for, the, republic, as, the, royalists, and, their, british, and, spanish, supporters, were, also, offering, freedom, for, slaves, willing, to, fight, for, their, cause, the, commissioners, outbid, them, by, abolishing, slavery, in, the, north, in, august, and, throughout, the, colony, in, october, representatives, were, sent, to, paris, to, gain, the, approval, of, the, convention, for, the, decision, the, convention, voted, for, the, abolition, of, slavery, in, the, colonies, on, 4, february, 1794, and, decreed, that, all, residents, of, the, colonies, had, the, full, rights, of, french, citizens, irrespective, of, colour, an, army, of, 1, 000, sans, culottes, led, by, victor, hugues, was, sent, to, guadeloupe, to, expel, the, british, and, enforce, the, decree, the, army, recruited, former, slaves, and, eventually, numbered, 11, 000, capturing, guadeloupe, and, other, smaller, islands, abolition, was, also, proclaimed, on, guyane, martinique, remained, under, british, occupation, while, colonial, landowners, in, r, union, and, the, les, mascareignes, repulsed, the, republicans, black, armies, drove, the, spanish, out, of, saint, domingue, in, 1795, and, the, last, of, the, british, withdrew, in, 1798, in, republican, controlled, areas, from, 1793, to, 1799, freed, slaves, were, required, to, work, on, their, former, plantations, or, for, their, former, masters, if, they, were, in, domestic, service, they, were, paid, a, wage, and, gained, property, rights, black, and, coloured, generals, were, effectively, in, control, of, large, areas, of, guadeloupe, and, saint, domingue, including, toussaint, louverture, in, the, north, of, saint, domingue, and, andr, rigaud, in, the, south, historian, fr, deric, r, gent, states, that, the, restrictions, on, the, freedom, of, employment, and, movement, of, former, slaves, meant, that, only, whites, persons, of, color, already, freed, before, the, decree, and, former, slaves, in, the, army, or, on, warships, really, benefited, from, general, emancipation, newspapers, and, pamphlets, played, a, central, role, in, stimulating, and, defining, the, revolution, prior, to, 1789, there, have, been, a, small, number, of, heavily, censored, newspapers, that, needed, a, royal, licence, to, operate, but, the, estates, general, created, an, enormous, demand, for, news, and, over, 130, newspapers, appeared, by, the, end, of, the, year, among, the, most, significant, were, marat, s, l, ami, du, peuple, and, elys, e, loustallot, s, revolutions, de, paris, over, the, next, decade, more, than, 2, 000, newspapers, were, founded, 500, in, paris, alone, most, lasted, only, a, matter, of, weeks, but, they, became, the, main, communication, medium, combined, with, the, very, large, pamphlet, literature, newspapers, were, read, aloud, in, taverns, and, clubs, and, circulated, hand, to, hand, there, was, a, widespread, assumption, that, writing, was, a, vocation, not, a, business, and, the, role, of, the, press, was, the, advancement, of, civic, republicanism, by, 1793, the, radicals, were, most, active, but, initially, the, royalists, flooded, the, country, with, their, publication, the, l, ami, du, roi, friends, of, the, king, until, they, were, suppressed, to, illustrate, the, differences, between, the, new, republic, and, the, old, regime, the, leaders, needed, to, implement, a, new, set, of, symbols, to, be, celebrated, instead, of, the, old, religious, and, monarchical, symbols, to, this, end, symbols, were, borrowed, from, historic, cultures, and, redefined, while, those, of, the, old, regime, were, either, destroyed, or, reattributed, acceptable, characteristics, these, revised, symbols, were, used, to, instil, in, the, public, a, new, sense, of, tradition, and, reverence, for, the, enlightenment, and, the, republic, la, marseillaise, french, pronunciation, became, the, national, anthem, of, france, the, song, was, written, and, composed, in, 1792, by, claude, joseph, rouget, de, lisle, and, was, originally, titled, chant, de, guerre, pour, l, arm, e, du, rhin, the, french, national, convention, adopted, it, as, the, first, republic, s, anthem, in, 1795, it, acquired, its, nickname, after, being, sung, in, paris, by, volunteers, from, marseille, marching, on, the, capital, the, song, is, the, first, example, of, the, european, march, anthemic, style, while, the, evocative, melody, and, lyrics, led, to, its, widespread, use, as, a, song, of, revolution, and, incorporation, into, many, pieces, of, classical, and, popular, music, de, lisle, was, instructed, to, produce, a, hymn, which, conveys, to, the, soul, of, the, people, the, enthusiasm, which, it, the, music, suggests, the, guillotine, remains, the, principal, symbol, of, the, terror, in, the, french, revolution, invented, by, a, physician, during, the, revolution, as, a, quicker, more, efficient, and, more, distinctive, form, of, execution, the, guillotine, became, a, part, of, popular, culture, and, historic, memory, it, was, celebrated, on, the, left, as, the, people, s, avenger, for, example, in, the, revolutionary, song, la, guillotine, permanente, and, cursed, as, the, symbol, of, the, terror, by, the, right, its, operation, became, a, popular, entertainment, that, attracted, great, crowds, of, spectators, vendors, sold, programmes, listing, the, names, of, those, scheduled, to, die, many, people, came, day, after, day, and, vied, for, the, best, locations, from, which, to, observe, the, proceedings, knitting, women, tricoteuses, formed, a, cadre, of, hardcore, regulars, inciting, the, crowd, parents, often, brought, their, children, by, the, end, of, the, terror, the, crowds, had, thinned, drastically, repetition, had, staled, even, this, most, grisly, of, entertainments, and, audiences, grew, bored, cockades, were, widely, worn, by, revolutionaries, beginning, in, 1789, they, now, pinned, the, blue, and, red, cockade, of, paris, onto, the, white, cockade, of, the, ancien, r, gime, camille, desmoulins, asked, his, followers, to, wear, green, cockades, on, 12, july, 1789, the, paris, militia, formed, on, 13, july, adopted, a, blue, and, red, cockade, blue, and, red, are, the, traditional, colours, of, paris, and, they, are, used, on, the, city, s, coat, of, arms, cockades, with, various, colour, schemes, were, used, during, the, storming, of, the, bastille, on, 14, july, the, liberty, cap, also, known, as, the, phrygian, cap, or, pileus, is, a, brimless, felt, cap, that, is, conical, in, shape, with, the, tip, pulled, forward, it, reflects, roman, republicanism, and, liberty, alluding, to, the, roman, ritual, of, manumission, in, which, a, freed, slave, receives, the, bonnet, as, a, symbol, of, his, newfound, liberty, deprived, of, political, rights, by, the, ancien, r, gime, the, revolution, initially, allowed, women, to, participate, although, only, to, a, limited, degree, activists, included, girondists, like, olympe, de, gouges, author, of, the, declaration, of, the, rights, of, woman, and, of, the, female, citizen, and, charlotte, corday, killer, of, marat, others, like, th, roigne, de, m, ricourt, pauline, l, on, and, the, society, of, revolutionary, republican, women, supported, the, jacobins, staged, demonstrations, in, the, national, assembly, and, took, part, in, the, october, 1789, march, to, versailles, despite, this, the, 1791, and, 1793, constitutions, denied, them, political, rights, and, democratic, citizenship, in, 1793, the, society, of, revolutionary, republican, women, campaigned, for, strict, price, controls, on, bread, and, a, law, that, would, compel, all, women, to, wear, the, tricolour, cockade, although, both, demands, were, successful, in, october, the, male, dominated, jacobins, who, then, controlled, the, government, denounced, the, society, as, dangerous, rabble, rousers, and, made, all, women, s, clubs, and, associations, illegal, organised, women, were, permanently, shut, out, of, the, french, revolution, after, 30, october, 1793, at, the, same, time, especially, in, the, provinces, women, played, a, prominent, role, in, resisting, social, changes, introduced, by, the, revolution, this, was, particularly, so, in, terms, of, the, reduced, role, of, the, catholic, church, for, those, living, in, rural, areas, closing, of, the, churches, meant, a, loss, of, normality, this, sparked, a, counter, revolutionary, movement, led, by, women, while, supporting, other, political, and, social, changes, they, opposed, the, dissolution, of, the, catholic,

viewing, themselves, as, defenders, of, faith, olympe, de, gouges, was, an, author, whose, publications, emphasised, that, while, women, and, men, were, different, this, should, not, prevent, equality, under, the, law, in, her, declaration, of, the, rights, of, woman, and, of, the, female, citizen, she, insisted, women, deserved, rights, especially, in, areas, concerning, them, directly, such, as, divorce, and, recognition, of, illegitimate, children, along, with, other, girondists, she, was, executed, in, november, 1793, during, the, terror, madame, roland, also, known, as, manon, or, marie, roland, was, another, important, female, activist, whose, political, focus, was, not, specifically, women, but, other, aspects, of, the, government, a, girondist, her, personal, letters, to, leaders, of, the, revolution, influenced, policy, in, addition, she, often, hosted, political, gatherings, of, the, brissotins, a, political, group, which, allowed, women, to, join, she, too, was, executed, in, november, 1793, the, revolution, abolished, many, economic, constraints, imposed, by, the, ancien, r, gime, including, church, tithes, and, feudal, dues, although, tenants, often, paid, higher, rents, and, taxes, all, church, lands, were, nationalised, along, with, those, owned, by, royalist, exiles, which, were, used, to, back, paper, currency, known, as, assignats, and, the, feudal, guild, system, eliminated, it, also, abolished, the, highly, inefficient, system, of, tax, farming, whereby, private, individuals, would, collect, taxes, for, a, hefty, fee, the, government, seized, the, foundations, that, had, been, set, up, starting, in, the, 13th, century, to, provide, an, annual, stream, of, revenue, for, hospitals, poor, relief, and, education, the, state, sold, the, lands, but, typically, local, authorities, did, not, replace, the, funding, and, so, most, of, the, nation, s, charitable, and, school, systems, were, massively, disrupted, between, 1790, and, 1796, industrial, and, agricultural, output, dropped, foreign, trade, plunged, and, prices, soared, forcing, the, government, to, finance, expenditure, by, issuing, ever, increasing, quantities, assignats, when, this, resulted, in, escalating, inflation, the, response, was, to, impose, price, controls, and, persecute, private, speculators, and, traders, creating, a, black, market, between, 1789, and, 1793, the, annual, deficit, increased, from, 10, to, 64, of, gross, national, product, while, annual, inflation, reached, 3, 500, after, a, poor, harvest, in, 1794, and, the, removal, of, price, controls, the, assignats, were, withdrawn, in, 1796, but, inflation, continued, until, the, introduction, of, the, gold, based, franc, germinal, in, 1803, the, french, revolution, had, a, major, impact, on, western, history, by, ending, feudalism, in, france, and, creating, a, path, for, advances, in, individual, freedoms, throughout, europe, the, revolution, represented, the, most, significant, challenge, to, political, absolutism, up, to, that, point, in, history, and, spread, democratic, ideals, throughout, europe, and, ultimately, the, world, its, impact, on, french, nationalism, was, profound, while, also, stimulating, nationalist, movements, throughout, europe, some, modern, historians, argue, the, concept, of, the, nation, state, was, a, direct, consequence, of, the, revolution, as, such, the, revolution, is, often, seen, as, marking, the, start, of, modernity, and, the, modern, period, the, long, term, impact, on, france, was, profound, shaping, politics, society, religion, and, ideas, and, polarising, politics, for, more, than, a, century, historian, fran, ois, aulard, wrote, from, the, social, point, of, view, the, revolution, consisted, in, the, suppression, of, what, was, called, the, feudal, system, in, the, emancipation, of, the, individual, in, greater, division, of, landed, property, the, abolition, of, the, privileges, of, noble, birth, the, establishment, of, equality, the, simplification, of, life, the, french, revolution, differed, from, other, revolutions, in, being, not, merely, national, for, it, aimed, at, benefiting, all, humanity, the, revolution, permanently, crippled, the, power, of, the, aristocracy, and, drained, the, wealth, of, the, church, although, the, two, institutions, survived, hanson, suggests, the, french, underwent, a, fundamental, transformation, in, self, identity, evidenced, by, the, elimination, of, privileges, and, their, replacement, by, intrinsic, human, rights, after, the, collapse, of, the, first, french, empire, in, 1815, the, french, public, lost, many, of, the, rights, and, privileges, earned, since, the, revolution, but, remembered, the, participatory, politics, that, characterised, the, period, according, to, paul, hanson, revolution, became, a, tradition, and, republicanism, an, enduring, option, the, revolution, meant, an, end, to, arbitrary, royal, rule, and, held, out, the, promise, of, rule, by, law, under, a, constitutional, order, napoleon, as, emperor, set, up, a, constitutional, system, and, the, restored, bourbons, were, forced, to, retain, one, after, the, abdication, of, napoleon, iii, in, 1871, the, french, third, republic, was, launched, with, a, deep, commitment, to, upholding, the, ideals, of, the, revolution, the, vichy, regime, 1940, 1944, tried, to, undo, the, revolutionary, heritage, but, retained, the, republic, however, there, were, no, efforts, by, the, bourbons, vichy, or, any, other, government, to, restore, the, privileges, that, had, been, stripped, away, from, the, nobility, in, 1789, france, permanently, became, a, society, of, equals, under, the, law, agriculture, was, transformed, by, the, revolution, with, the, breakup, of, large, estates, controlled, by, the, church, and, the, nobility, and, worked, by, hired, hands, rural, france, became, more, a, land, of, small, independent, farms, harvest, taxes, were, ended, such, as, the, tithe, and, seigneurial, dues, primogeniture, was, ended, both, for, nobles, and, peasants, thereby, weakening, the, family, patriarch, and, led, to, a, fall, in, the, birth, rate, since, all, children, had, a, share, in, the, family, property, cobban, argues, the, revolution, bequeathed, to, the, nation, a, ruling, class, of, landowners, economic, historians, are, divided, on, the, economic, impact, of, the, revolution, one, suggestion, is, the, resulting, fragmentation, of, agricultural, holdings, had, a, significant, negative, impact, in, the, early, years, of, 19th, century, then, became, positive, in, the, second, half, of, the, century, because, it, facilitated, the, rise, in, human, capital, investments, others, argue, the, redistribution, of, land, had, an, immediate, positive, impact, on, agricultural, productivity, before, the, scale, of, these, gains, gradually, declined, over, the, course, of, the, 19th, century, in, the, cities, entrepreneurship, on, a, small, scale, flourished, as, restrictive, monopolies, privileges, barriers, rules, taxes, and, guilds, gave, way, however, the, british, blockade, virtually, ended, overseas, and, colonial, trade, hurting, the, cities, and, their, supply, chains, overall, the, revolution, did, not, greatly, change, the, french, business, system, and, probably, helped, freeze, in, place, the, horizons, of, the, small, business, owner, the, typical, businessman, owned, a, small, store, mill, or, shop, with, family, help, and, a, few, paid, employees, large, scale, industry, was, less, common, than, in, other, industrialising, nations, historians, often, see, the, impact, of, the, revolution, as, through, the, institutions, and, ideas, exported, by, napoleon, economic, historians, dan, bogart, mauricio, drelichman, oscar, gelderblom, and, jean, laurent, rosenthal, describe, napoleon, s, codified, law, as, the, french, revolution, s, most, significant, export, according, to, daron, acemoglu, davide, cantoni, simon, johnson, and, james, a, robinson, the, french, revolution, had, long, term, effects, in, europe, they, suggest, that, areas, that, were, occupied, by, the, french, and, that, underwent, radical, institutional, reform, experienced, more, rapid, urbanization, and, economic, growth, especially, after, 1850, there, is, no, evidence, of, a, negative, effect, of, french, invasion, the, revolution, sparked, intense, debate, in, britain, the, revolution, controversy, was, a, pamphlet, war, set, off, by, the, publication, of, a, discourse, on, the, love, of, our, country, a, speech, given, by, richard, price, to, the, revolution, society, on, 4, november, 1789, supporting, the, french, revolution, edmund, burke, responded, in, november, 1790, with, his, own, pamphlet, reflections, on, the, revolution, in, france, attacking, the, french, revolution, as, a, threat, to, the, aristocracy, of, all, countries, william, coxe, opposed, price, s, premise, that, one, s, country, is, principles, and, people, not, the, state, itself, conversely, two, seminal, political, pieces, of, political, history, were, written, in, price, s, favour, supporting, the, general, right, of, the, french, people, to, replace, their, state, one, of, the, first, of, these, pamphlets, into, print, was, a, vindication, of, the, rights, of, men, by, mary, wollstonecraft, wollstonecraft, s, title, was, echoed, by, thomas, paine, s, rights, of, man, published, a, few, months, later, in, 1792, christopher, wyvill, published, defence, of, dr, price, and, the, reformers, of, england, a, plea, for, reform, and, moderation, this, exchange, of, ideas, has, been, described, as, one, of, the, great, political, debates, in, british, history, in, ireland, the, effect, was, to, transform, what, had, been, an, attempt, by, protestant, settlers, to, gain, some, autonomy, into, a, mass, movement, led, by, the, society, of, united, irishmen, involving, catholics, and, protestants, it, stimulated, the, demand, for, further, reform, throughout, ireland, especially, in, ulster, the, upshot, was, a, revolt, in, 1798, led, by, wolfe, tone, that, was, crushed, by, britain, german, reaction, to, the, revolution, swung, from, favourable, to, antagonistic, at, first, it, brought, liberal, and, democratic, ideas, the, end, of, guilds, serfdom, and, the, jewish, ghetto, it, brought, economic, freedoms, and, agrarian, and, legal, reform, above, all, the, antagonism, helped, stimulate, and, shape, german, nationalism, france, invaded, switzerland, and, turned, it, into, the, helvetic, republic, 1798, 1803, a, french, puppet, state, french, interference, with, localism, and, traditions, was, deeply, resented, in, switzerland, although, some, reforms, took, hold, and, survived, in, the, later, period, of, restoration, during, the, revolutionary, wars, the, french, invaded, and, occupied, the, region, now, known, as, belgium, between, 1794, and, 1814, the, new, government, enforced, reforms, incorporating, the, region, into, france, resistance, was, strong, in, every, sector, as, belgian, nationalism, emerged, to, oppose, french, rule, the, french, legal, system, however, was, adopted, with, its, equal, legal, rights, and, abolition, of, class, distinctions, the, kingdom, of, denmark, adopted, liberalising, reforms, in, line, with, those, of, the, french, revolution, reform, was, gradual, and, the, regime, itself, carried, out, agrarian, reforms, that, had, the, effect, of, weakening, absolutism, by, creating, a, class, of, independent, peasant, freeholders, much, of, the, initiative, came, from, well, organised, liberals, who, directed, political, change, in, the, first, half, of, the, 19th, century, the, constitution, of, norway, of, 1814, was, inspired, by, the, french, revolution, and, was, considered, to, be, one, of, the, most, liberal, and, democratic, constitutions, at, the, time, initially, most, people, in, the, province, of, quebec, were, favourable, toward, the, revolutionaries, aims, the, revolution, took, place, against, the, background, of, an, ongoing, campaign, for, constitutional, reform, in, the, colony, by, loyalist, emigrants, from, the, united, states, public, opinion, began, to, shift, against, the, revolution, after, the, flight, to, varennes, and, further, soured, after, the, september, massacres, and, the, subsequent, execution, of, louis, xvi, french, migration, to, the, canadas, experienced, a, substantial, decline, during, and, after, the, revolution, only, a, limited, number, of, artisans, professionals, and, religious, emigres, were, allowed, to, settle, in, the, region, during, this, period, most, emigres, settled, in, montreal, or, quebec, city, the, influx, of, religious, emigres, also, revitalised, the, local, catholic, church, with, exiled, priests, establishing, a, number, of, parishes, across, the, canadas, in, the, united,

democratic, republican, party, led, by, former, american, minister, to, france, thomas, jefferson, favored, revolutionary, france, and, pointed, to, the, 1778, treaty, that, was, still, in, effect,

instead, the, first, writings, on, the, french, revolution, were, near, contemporaneous, with, events, and, mainly, divided, along, ideological, lines, these, included, edmund, burke, s, conservative, critique, reflections, on, the, revolution, in, france, 1790, and, thomas, paine, s, response, rights, of, man, 1791, from, 1815, narrative, histories, dominated, often, based, on, first, hand, experience, of, the, revolutionary, years, by, the, mid, nineteenth, century, more, scholarly, histories, appeared, written, by, specialists, and, based, on, original, documents, and, a, more, critical, assessment, of, contemporary, accounts, dupuy, identifies, three, main, strands, in, nineteenth, century, historiography, of, the, revolution, the, first, is, represented, by, reactionary, writers, who, rejected, the, revolutionary, ideals, of, popular, sovereignty, civil, equality, and, the, promotion, of, rationality, progress, and, personal, happiness, over, religious, faith, the, second, stream, is, those, writers, who, celebrated, its, democratic, and, republican, values, the, third, were, liberals, like, germaine, de, sta, l, and, guizot, who, accepted, the, necessity, of, reforms, establishing, a, constitution, and, the, rights, of, man, but, rejected, state, interference, with, private, property, and, individual, rights, even, when, supported, by, a, democratic, majority, jules, michelet, was, a, leading, 19th, century, historian, of, the, democratic, republican, strand, and, thiers, mignet, and, tocqueville, were, prominent, in, the, liberal, strand, hippolyte, taine, s, origins, of, contemporary, france, 1875, 1894, was, modern, in, its, use, of, departmental, archives, but, dupuy, sees, him, as, reactionary, given, his, contempt, for, the, crowd, and, revolutionary, values, the, broad, distinction, between, conservative, democratic, republican, and, liberal, interpretations, of, the, revolution, persisted, in, the, 20th, century, although, historiography, became, more, nuanced, with, greater, attention, to, critical, analysis, of, documentary, evidence, alphonse, aulard, 1849, 1928, was, the, first, professional, historian, of, the, revolution, he, promoted, graduate, studies, scholarly, editions, and, learned, journals, his, major, work, the, french, revolution, a, political, history, 1789, 1804, 1905, was, a, democratic, and, republican, interpretation, of, the, revolution, socio, economic, analysis, and, a, focus, on, the, experiences, of, ordinary, people, dominated, french, studies, of, the, revolution, from, the, 1930s, georges, lefebvre, elaborated, a, marxist, socio, economic, analysis, of, the, revolution, with, detailed, studies, of, peasants, the, rural, panic, of, 1789, and, the, behaviour, of, revolutionary, crowds, albert, soboul, also, writing, in, the, marxist, republican, tradition, published, a, major, study, of, the, sans, culottes, in, 1958, alfred, cobban, challenged, jacobin, marxist, social, and, economic, explanations, of, the, revolution, in, two, important, works, the, myth, of, the, french, revolution, 1955, and, social, interpretation, of, the, french, revolution, 1964, he, argued, the, revolution, was, primarily, a, political, conflict, which, ended, in, a, victory, for, conservative, property, owners, a, result, which, retarded, economic, development, in, their, 1965, work, la, revolution, fran, aise, fran, ois, furet, and, denis, richet, also, argued, for, the, primacy, of, political, decisions, contrasting, the, reformist, period, of, 1789, to, 1790, with, the, following, interventions, of, the, urban, masses, which, led, to, radicalisation, and, an, ungovernable, situation, from, the, 1990s, western, scholars, largely, abandoned, marxist, interpretations, of, the, revolution, in, terms, of, bourgeoisie, proletarian, class, struggle, as, anachronistic, however, no, new, explanatory, model, has, gained, widespread, support, the, historiography, of, the, revolution, has, expanded, into, areas, such, as, cultural, and, regional, histories, visual, representations, transnational, interpretations, and, decolonisation
