jungjong, was, a, fundamentally, weak, king, because, of, the, circumstances, that, placed, him, on, the, throne, but, his, reign, also, saw, a, period, of, significant, reforms, led, by, his, minister, jo, gwang, jo, the, charismatic, leader, of, sarim, he, established, a, local, self, government, system, called, hyangyak, to, strengthen, local, autonomy, and, communal, spirit, among, the, people, sought, to, reduce, the, gap, between, the, rich, and, poor, with, a, land, reform, that, would, distribute, land, to, farmers, more, equally, and, limit, the, amount, of, land, and, number, of, slaves, that, one, could, own, promulgated, widely, among, the, populace, confucian, writings, with, vernacular, translations, and, sought, to, trim, the, size, of, government, by, reducing, the, number, of, bureaucrats, according, to, the, veritable, records, of, the, joseon, dynasty, it, was, said, that, no, official, dared, to, receive, a, bribe, or, exploit, the, populace, during, this, time, because, as, inspector, general, he, applied, the, law, strictly, these, radical, reforms, were, very, popular, with, the, populace, but, were, fiercely, opposed, by, the, conservative, officials, who, had, helped, to, put, jungjong, on, the, throne, they, plotted, to, cause, jungjong, to, doubt, jo, s, loyalty, jo, gwang, jo, was, executed, and, most, of, his, reform, measures, died, with, him, in, the, resulting, third, literati, purge, for, nearly, 50, years, afterward, the, court, politics, were, marred, by, bloody, and, chaotic, struggles, between, factions, backing, rival, consorts, and, princes, in, laws, of, the, royal, family, wielded, great, power, and, contributed, to, much, corruption, in, that, era, the, middle, joseon, period, was, marked, by, intense, and, bloody, power, struggles, between, political, factions, that, weakened, the, country, and, by, large, scale, invasions, by, japan, and, manchu, which, nearly, toppled, the, kingdom, the, sarim, faction, had, suffered, a, series, of, political, defeats, during, the, reigns, of, yeonsangun, jungjong, and, myeongjong, but, it, gained, control, of, the, government, during, the, reign, of, king, seonjo, it, soon, split, into, opposing, factions, known, as, the, easterners, and, the, westerners, by, their, political, or, philosophical, masters, easterners, mainly, followed, the, teachings, and, philosophy, of, yi, hwang, and, jo, sik, while, the, westerners, followed, the, philosophy, of, yi, i, and, song, hon, within, decades, the, easterners, themselves, divided, into, the, southerners, and, the, northerners, in, the, seventeenth, century, the, westerners, also, permanently, split, into, the, noron, and, the, soron, factions, in, the, joseon, dynasty, were, formed, based, on, their, different, interpretations, of, confucian, philosophy, which, mainly, differed, according, to, who, their, master, was, and, what, they, believed, in, the, alternations, in, power, among, these, factions, were, often, accompanied, by, charges, of, treason, and, bloody, purges, initiating, a, cycle, of, revenge, with, each, change, of, regime, one, example, is, the, 1589, rebellion, of, jeong, yeo, rip, one, of, the, bloodiest, political, purges, of, joseon, jeong, yeo, rip, an, easterner, had, formed, a, society, with, a, group, of, supporters, that, also, received, military, training, to, fight, against, waegu, there, is, still, a, dispute, about, the, nature, and, purpose, of, his, group, which, reflected, the, desire, for, a, classless, society, and, spread, throughout, honam, he, was, subsequently, accused, of, conspiracy, to, start, a, rebellion, jeong, cheol, head, of, the, western, faction, was, in, charge, of, investigating, the, case, and, used, this, event, to, affect, the, widespread, purge, of, easterners, who, had, the, slightest, connection, to, jeong, yeo, rip, eventually, 1000, easterners, were, killed, or, exiled, in, the, aftermath, throughout, korean, history, there, was, frequent, piracy, on, sea, and, brigandage, on, land, the, only, purpose, for, the, joseon, navy, was, to, secure, the, maritime, trade, against, the, waegu,

to, serve, ming, china, and, depending, on, the, international, context, the, dominant, state, could, be, substituted, however, by, the, early, 1500s, the, relationship, between, ming, and, joseon, was, reinforced, through, a, father, son, dynamic, as, joseon, elites, began, to, regard, the, ming, emperor, not, just, as, a, suzerain, but, also, as, a, ritual, father, figure, this, transformation, held, significant, weight, because, unlike, the, changeable, loyalty, to, a, ruler, the, confucian, principle, of, filial, piety, was, considered, immutable, and, irrevocable, the,

pressure, on, them, by, banning, envoy, delegates, from, entering, the, country, or, demanding, unreasonable, tributes, but, in, the, end, joseon, which, had, a, theoretical, advantage, got, the, privilege, of, paying, tribute, at, least, one, or, two, times, a, year, joseon, enjoyed, the, most, opportunities, for, tribute, trade, with, china, and, the, tribute, trade, with, china, was,

experienced, numerous, economic, and, cultural, benefits, through, gifts, from, the, imperial, china, the, purpose, of, the, tribute, varied, depending, on, the, circumstances, but, it, was, usually,

nature, of, these, bilateral, diplomatic, exchanges, evolved, from, a, conceptual, framework, developed, by, the, chinese, gradually, the, theoretical, models, would, be, modified, mirroring, the, evolution, of, a, unique, relationship, as, an, initial, step, a, diplomatic, mission, was, dispatched, to, japan, in, 1402, the, joseon, envoy, sought, to, bring, about, the, re, establishment, of, amicable, relations, between, the, two, countries, and, he, was, charged, to, commemorate, the, good, relations, which, existed, in, ancient, times, this, mission, was, successful, and, sh, gun,

ranking, the, emperors, of, japan, at, the, time, were, figureheads, with, no, actual, political, or, military, power, and, the, actual, political, and, military, rulers, of, japan, that, joseon, communicated, with, were, the, shoguns, who, were, represented, as, tycoon, of, japan, in, many, foreign, communications, in, order, to, avoid, the, conflict, with, the, sinocentric, system, in, which, the, emperor, of, china, was, the, highest, authority, and, all, rulers, of, tributary, states, were, known, as, kings, the, exact, population, figures, of, joseon, era, korea, are, disputed, as, government, records, of, households, are, considered, unreliable, in, this, period, between, 1810, and, 1850, the, population, declined, approximately, 10, and, remained, stable, before, the, introduction, of, modern, medicine, by, the, korean, empire, government, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, average, life, expectancy, for, peasant, and, commoner, korean, males, was, 24, years, and, for, females, 26, years, accounting, for, infant, mortality, joseon, korea, installed, a, centralised, administrative, system, controlled, by, civil, bureaucrats, and, military, officers, who, were, collectively, called, yangban, by, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, the, yangban, had, acquired, most, of, the, traits, of, a, hereditary, nobility, except, that, the, status, was, based, on, a, unique, mixture, of, family, position, gwageo, examinations, for, confucian, learning, and, a, civil, service, system, the, family, of, a, yangban, who, did, not, succeed, in, becoming, a, government, official, for, the, third, generation, lost, their, yangban, status, and, became, commoners, for, most, part, the, only, way, to, become, a, government, official, was, to, pass, a, series, of, gwageo, exams, one, had, to, pass, the, lesser, gwageo, exam, in, both, of, two, stages, in, order, to, qualify, for, the, greater, gwageo, exam, which, again, one, had, to, pass, in, both, of, two, stages, to, become, a, government, official, the, yangban, and, the, king, in, an, uneasy, balance, controlled, the, central, government, and, military, institutions, the, proportion, of, yangban, may, have, reached, as, high, as, 30, by, 1800, due, to, the, later, practices, of, transaction, of, yangban, status, to, peasants, although, there, was, considerable, local, variation, as, the, government, was, small, a, great, many, yangban, were, local, gentry, of, high, social, status, but, not, always, of, high, income, another, portion, of, the, population, were, slaves, or, serfs, nobi, low, borns, cheonmin, or, untouchable, outcastes, baekjeong, slavery, in, korea, was, hereditary, as, well, as, a, form, of, legal, punishment, the, nobi, were, socially, indistinct, from, freemen, other, than, the, ruling, yangban, class, and, some, possessed, property, rights, legal, entities, and, civil, rights, hence, some, scholars, argue, that, it, is, inappropriate, to, call, them, slaves, while, some, scholars, describe, them, as, serfs, there, were, both, government, and, privately, owned, nobi, and, the, government, occasionally, gave, them, to, yangban, privately, owned, nobi, could, be, inherited, as, personal, property, during, poor, harvests, many, sangmin, people, would, voluntarily, become, nobi, in, order, to, survive, the, nobi, population, could, fluctuate, up, to, about, one, third, of, the, population, but, on, average, the, nobi, made, up, about, 10, of, the, total, population, joseon, slaves, could, and, often, did, own, property, private, slaves, could, buy, their, freedom, many, of, the, remaining, 40, 50, of, the, population, were, surely, farmers, but, recent, work, has, raised, important, issues, about, the, size, of, other, groups, merchants, and, traders, local, government, or, quasi, governmental, clerks, jungin, craftsmen, and, laborers, textile, workers, etc, given, the, size, of, the, population, it, may, be, that, a, typical, person, had, more, than, one, role, most, farming, was, at, any, rate, commercial, not, subsistence, in, addition, to, generating, additional, income, a, certain, amount, of, occupational, dexterity, may, have, been, required, to, avoid, the, worst, effects, of, an, often, heavy, and, corrupt, tax, system, gender, roles, tightened, during, the, joseon, period, compared, to, the, goryeo, era, the, influence, of, neo, confucianism, contributed, to, the, increasingly, male, dominated, society, of, the, time, women, were, expected, to, be, silent, and, not, socialize, with, men, who, were, not, their, relatives, they, were, required, to, be, chaste, to, their, husbands, and, widows, were, not, allowed, to, remarry, any, doubt, of, a, woman, s, chastity, would, bring, dishonor, to, the, family, to, protect, the, family, s, honor, young, girls, would, carry, a, small, knife, paedo, and, with, this, they, were, expected, to, take, their, own, lives, if, they, were, raped, or, even, rumored, to, be, caught, in, an, affair, laws, were, also, enacted, to, prohibit, women, from, riding, horses, or, playing, sports, during, the, late, joseon, the, confucian, ideals, of, propriety, and, filial, piety, gradually, came, to, be, equated, with, a, strict, observance, to, a, complex, social, hierarchy, with, many, fine, gradations, by, the, early, 18th, century, the, social, critic, yi, chung, hwan, 1690, 1756, sarcastically, complained, that, ith, so, many, different, ranks, and, grades, separating, people, from, one, another, people, tend, not, to, have, a, very, large, circle, of, friends, but, even, as, yi, wrote, the, informal, social, distinctions, of, the, early, joseon, were, being, reinforced, by, legal, discrimination, such, as, sumptuary, law, regulation, of, the, dress, of, different, social, groups, and, laws, restricting, inheritance, and, property, ownership, by, women, precisely, because, of, the, tenets, of, the, confucian, classic, of, filial, piety, the, adult, male, practice, of, joseon, korea, prescribed, to, keep, both, hair, and, beard, in, contrast, to, the, japanese, tokugawa, period, yet, these, laws, may, have, been, announced, precisely, because, social, mobility, was, increasing, particularly, during, the, prosperous, century, beginning, about, 1710, the, original, social, hierarchy, of, the, joseon, era, was, developed, based, on, the, social, hierarchy, of, the, goryeo, era, in, the, 14th, 16th, centuries, this, hierarchy, was, strict, and, stable, since, economic, opportunities, to, change, status, were, limited, no, law, was, needed, in, the, late, 17th, to, 19th, centuries, new, commercial, groups, emerged, and, the, old, class, system, was, extremely, weakened, the, situation, was, most, marked, in, the, daegu, region, s, yangban, class, where, they, were, expected, to, reach, nearly, 70, in, 1858, in, 1801, government, owned, slaves, were, all, emancipated, and, the, institution, gradually, died, out, over, the, next, century, by, 1858, the, nobi, population, stood, at, about, 1, 5, percent, of, the, total, population, of, korea, the, institution, was, completely, abolished, as, part, of, a, social, plan, in, the, gabo, reform, of, 1894, seonbis, korean, hanja, played, a, major, role, within, political, factions, of, the, joseon, dynasty, etymologically, derived, from, a, native, korean, word, meaning, someone, who, is, wise, and, knowledgeable, the, word, later, became, synonymous, with, the, chinese, character, sh, which, meant, scholar, or, retainer, as, the, joseon, dynasty, encouraged, the, study, of, confucianism, seonbis, were, interpreted, as, students, who, study, confucianism, in, joseon, era, korean, society, seonbis, lived, under, strict, standardized, confucianist, guidelines, although, they, were, encouraged, to, participate, in, politics, and, act, as, advisors, to, the, king, many, seonbis, lived, quiet, lives, in, secluded, regions, unaffiliated, with, any, government, office, these, seonbis, often, organized, scholarly, communities, which, often, imposed, a, huge, influence, over, local, regions, those, who, became, office, holders, acted, as, aristocrats, boasting, influence, over, joseon, politics, seonbis, consistently, used, debate, as, a, major, decision, making, method, seonbis, expressed, their, views, on, problems, to, be, solved, in, front, of, the, king, and, discussed, the, wrongdoings, of, the, other, faction, s, argument, these, political, clashes, often, led, to, violence, such, as, the, korean, literati, purges, seonbis, also, participated, in, righteous, armies, during, times, of, war, as, archery, was, taught, as, a, liberal, arts, subject, for, seonbis, seonbis, such, as, gwak, jae, u, ko, kyung, myung, and, jo, heon,

great, cultural, growth, during, which, joseon, culture, created, the, first, korean, tea, ceremony, korean, gardens, and, extensive, historic, works, the, royal, dynasty, also, built, several, fortresses, and, palaces, noble, korean, women, during, this, time, were, suppressed, along, with, shamans, in, the, 15th, century, because, of, neo, confucianist, social, norms, when, they, previously, led, some, of, the, least, restricted, lives, out, of, anyone, in, asia, during, the, joseon, period, jeogori, of, women, s, hanbok, became, gradually, tightened, and, shortened, in, the, 16th, century, jeogori, was, baggy, and, reached, below, the, waist, but, by, the, 19th, century, jeogori, was, shortened, to, the, point, that, it, did, not, cover, the, breasts, so, another, piece, of, cloth, heoritti, was, used, to, cover, them, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, heungseon, daewongun, introduced, magoja, a, manchu, style, jacket, to, korea, which, is, often, worn, with, hanbok, to, this, day, chima, was, full, skirted, and, jeogori, was, short, and, tight, in, the, late, joseon, period, fullness, in, the, skirt, was, emphasized, round, the, hips, many, undergarments, were, worn, underneath, chima, such, as, darisokgot, soksokgot, dansokgot, and, gojengi, to, achieve, a, desired, silhouette, because, jeogori, was, so, short, it, became, natural, to, expose,

increased, realism, a, national, painting, style, of, landscapes, called, true, view, began, moving, from, the, traditional, chinese, style, of, idealized, general, landscapes, to, particular, locations, exactly, rendered, while, not, photographic, the, style, was, academic, enough, to, become, established, and, supported, as, a, standardized, style, in, korean, painting, at, this, time,

popular, art, during, the, joseon, period, examples, of, ceramics, include, white, porcelain, or, white, porcelain, decorated, with, cobalt, copper, red, underglaze, blue, underglaze, and, iron, underglaze, ceramics, from, the, joseon, period, differ, from, other, periods, because, artists, felt, that, each, piece, of, art, deserved, its, own, uniquely, cultivated, personality, beginning, in, the, 10th, century, white, porcelain, has, been, crafted, in, korea, historically, overshadowed, by, the, popularity, of, celadon, it, was, not, until, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, that, white, porcelain, also, known, as, baekje, was, recognized, for, its, artistic, value, among, the, most, prized, of, korean, ceramics, are, large, white, jars, their, shape, is, symbolic, of, the, moon, and, their, color, is, associated, with, the, ideals, of, purity, and, modesty, of, confucianism, during, this, period, the, bureau, that, oversaw, the, meals, and, court, banquets, of, the, royal, family,

cobalt, pigment, are, another, example, of, popular, wares, of, the, joseon, period, many, of, these, items, were, created, by, court, painters, employed, by, the, royal, family, during, this, period, the, popular, style, of, landscape, paintings, is, mirrored, in, the, decoration, of, ceramics, initially, developed, by, the, chinese, at, the, jingdezhen, kilns, in, the, mid, 14th, century, joseon, began, to, produce, this, type, of, porcelain, from, the, 15th, century, under, chinese, influence, the, first, cobalt, imported, from, china, was, used, by, korean, artists, in, 1463, when, sources, of, cobalt, were, discovered, in, korea, artists, and, their, buyers, found, the, material, was, inferior, in, quality, and, preferred, the, more, expensive, imported, cobalt, korean, porcelain, with, imported, cobalt, decoration, contradict, the, emphasis, of, an, orderly, frugal, and, moderate, life, in, neo, confucianism, strikingly, different, from, cobalt, porcelain, items, with, a, copper, red, underglaze, are, the, most, difficult, to, successfully, craft, during, production, these, items, require, great, skill, and, attention, or, will, turn, gray, during, the, process, of, firing, while, the, birthplace, of, ceramics, with, copper, red, underglaze, is, widely, disputed, these, items, originated, during, 12th, century, in, korea, and, became, increasingly, popular, during, the, second, half, of, the, joseon, period, some, experts, have, pointed, to, the, kilns, of, bunwon, ri, in, gwangju, a, city, that, played, a, significant, role, in, the, production, of, ceramics, during, the, joseon, period, as, a, possible, birthplace, porcelain, was, also, decorated, with, iron, these, items, commonly, consisted, of, jars, or, other, utilitarian, pieces, during, the, joseon, period, the, yangban, scholars, and, educated, literati, studied, confucian, classics, and, neo, confucian, literature, 204, the, middle, and, upper, classes, of, joseon, society, were, proficient, in, classical, chinese, 329, the, joseon, official, records, such, as, the, veritable, records, of, the, joseon, dynasty, and, seungjeongwon, ilgi, and, the, written, works, of, the, yangban, literati, were, written, in, classical, chinese, 243, 329, 74, newspapers, like, the, hwangs, ng, shinmun, toward, the, end, of, the, period, were, written, in, the, korean, language, using, the,

family, the, joseon, kingdom, was, noted, for, having, confucianism, as, its, main, philosophy, and, also, included, some, buddhism, the, study, of, literary, exchanges, between, confucian, scholar, officials, and, buddhists, shows, that, buddhism, was, not, cast, out, there, literary, exchanges, show, a, middle, ground, of, both, philosophies, scholar, officials, some, who, in, public, castigated, buddhism, as, a, heresy, and, deluded, tradition, in, private, visited, temples, and, associated, closely, with, monks, this, shows, that, while, in, public, some, scholars, shamed, buddhists, their, exchanges, with, buddhists, show, that, at, the, very, least, it, was, not, cast, outside, of, the, kingdom, one, example, of, this, is, a, famous, joseon, scholar, official, park, se, dang, 1629, 1703, he, argues, against, buddhism, with, the, following, people, say, that, han, yu, and, ouyang, xiu, have, harshly, criticized, buddhism, and, therefore, have, only, discussed, what, is, aberrant, and, have, not, fully, investigated, what, is, profound, people, say, their, understanding, is, lacking, and, they, have, not, fully, examined, it, i, myself, don, t, think, that, is, the, case, the, heresies, under, heaven, they, are, also, rather, foul, among, them, buddhism, is, the, worst, if, a, person, is, inclined, to, buddhism, then, he, is, of, the, kind, that,
