egyptian, thebes, as, thebes, of, the, hundred, gates, th, bai, hekat, mpyloi, or, hundred, gated, thebes, as, opposed, to, the, thebes, of, the, seven, gates, th, bai, hept, pyloi, in, boeotia,

first, dynasty, was, located, in, the, same, region, as, thebes, for, this, reason, both, cities, were, at, a, crossroad, region, in, upper, egypt, between, the, nile, in, the, north, to, south, direction, and, saharan, caravan, routes, connecting, to, red, sea, maritime, routes, via, wadi, hammamat, in, the, east, west, direction, the, wadi, el, hol, is, also, located, near, thebes, this,

thebes, the, largest, city, in, egypt, at, the, time, historian, ian, morris, has, estimated, that, by, 1500, bc, thebes, may, have, grown, to, be, the, largest, city, in, the, world, with, a, population, of, about, 75, 000, a, position, it, held, until, about, 900, bc, when, it, was, surpassed, by, nimrud, among, others, a, 2005, study, on, theban, nobles, had, found, that, the, mummified,

kingdom, pharaohs, although, no, buildings, survive, in, thebes, older, than, portions, of, the, karnak, temple, complex, that, may, date, from, the, middle, kingdom, the, lower, part, of, a, statue, of, pharaoh, nyuserre, of, the, 5th, dynasty, has, been, found, in, karnak, another, statue, dedicated, by, the, 12th, dynasty, king, senusret, may, have, been, usurped, and, re, used, since, the, statue, bears, a, cartouche, of, nyuserre, on, its, belt, since, seven, rulers, of, the, 4th, to, 6th, dynasties, appear, on, the, karnak, king, list, perhaps, at, the, least, there, was, a, temple, in, the, theban, area, that, dated, to, the, old, kingdom, by, 2160, bc, a, new, line, of, pharaohs, the, ninth, and, tenth, dynasties, consolidated, control, over, lower, egypt, and, northern, parts,

though, his, power, did, not, extend, much, further, than, the, general, theban, region, finally, by, c, 2050, bc, intef, iii, s, son, mentuhotep, ii, meaning, montu, is, satisfied, took, the, herakleopolitans, by, force, and, reunited, egypt, once, again, under, one, ruler, thereby, starting, the, period, now, known, as, the, middle, kingdom, mentuhotep, ii, ruled, for, 51, years, and, built, the, first, mortuary, temple, at, deir, el, bahri, which, most, likely, served, as, the, inspiration, for, the, later, and, larger, temple, built, next, to, it, by, hatshepsut, in, the, 18th, dynasty, after, these, events, the, 11th, dynasty, was, short, lived, as, less, than, twenty, years, had, elapsed, between, the, death, of, mentuhotep, ii, and, that, of, mentuhotep, iv, in,

began, settling, in, the, eastern, nile, delta, they, eventually, founded, the, 14th, dynasty, at, avaris, in, c, 1805, bc, or, c, 1710, bc, by, doing, so, the, asiatics, established, hegemony, over, the, majority, of, the, delta, region, subtracting, these, territories, from, the, influence, of, the, 13th, dynasty, that, had, meanwhile, succeeded, the, 12th, a, second, wave, of, asiatics, called, hyksos, from, heqa, khasut, rulers, of, foreign, lands, as, egyptians, called, their, leaders, immigrated, into, egypt, and, overran, the, canaanite, center, of, power, at, avaris, starting, the, 15th, dynasty, there, the, hyksos, kings, gained, the, upper, hand, over, lower, egypt, early, into, the, second, intermediate, period, 1657, 1549, bc, when, the, hyksos, took, memphis, during, or, shortly, after, merneferre, ay, s, reign, c, 1700, bc, the, rulers, of, the, 13th, dynasty, fled, south, to, thebes, which, was, restored, as, capital, theban, princes, now, known, as, the, 16th, dynasty, stood, firmly, over, their, immediate, region, as, the, hyksos, advanced, from, the, delta, southwards, to, middle, egypt, the, thebans, resisted, the, hyksos, further, advance, by, making, an, agreement, for, a, peaceful, concurrent, rule, between, them, the, hyksos, were, able, to, sail, upstream, past, thebes, to, trade, with, the, nubians, and, the, thebans, brought, their, herds, to, the, delta, without, adversaries, the, status, quo, continued, until, hyksos, ruler, apophis, 15th, dynasty, insulted, seqenenre, tao, 17th, dynasty, of, thebes, soon, the, armies, of, thebes, marched, on, the, hyksos, ruled, lands, tao, died, in, battle, and, his, son, kamose, took, charge, of, the, campaign, after, kamose, s, death, his, brother, ahmose, i, continued, until, he, captured, avaris, the, hyksos, capital, ahmose, i, drove, the, hyksos, out, of, egypt, and, the, levant, and, reclaimed, the, lands, formerly, ruled, by, them, ahmose, i, founded, a, new, age, for, a, unified, egypt, with, thebes, as, its, capital, the, city, remained, as, capital, during, most, of, the, 18th, dynasty, new, kingdom, it, also, became, the, center, for, a, newly, established, professional, civil, service, where, there, was, a, greater, demand, for, scribes, and, the, literate, as, the, royal, archives, began, to, fill, with, accounts, and, reports, at, the, city, the, favored, few, of,

than, thebes, for, instance, amenhotep, iii, poured, much, of, his, vast, wealth, from, foreign, tribute, into, the, temples, of, amun, the, theban, god, amun, became, a, principal, state, deity, and, every, building, project, sought, to, outdo, the, last, in, proclaiming, the, glory, of, amun, and, the, pharaohs, themselves, thutmose, i, reigned, 1506, 1493, bc, began, the, first, great, expansion, of, the, karnak, temple, after, this, colossal, enlargements, of, the, temple, became, the, norm, throughout, the, new, kingdom, queen, hatshepsut, reigned, 1479, 1458, bc, helped, the, theban, economy, flourish, by, renewing, trade, networks, primarily, the, red, sea, trade, between, thebes, red, sea, port, of, al, qusayr, elat, and, the, land, of, punt, her, successor, thutmose, iii, brought, to, thebes, a, great, deal, of, his, war, booty, that, originated, from, as, far, away, as, mittani, the, 18th, dynasty, reached, its, peak, during, his, great, grandson, amenhotep, iii, s, reign, 1388, 1350, bc, aside, from, embellishing, the, temples, of, amun, amenhotep, increased, construction, in, thebes, to, unprecedented, levels, on, the, west, bank, he, built, the, enormous,

and, the, worship, of, amun, was, proscribed, the, capital, was, moved, to, the, new, city, of, akhetaten, amarna, in, modern, egypt, midway, between, thebes, and, memphis, after, his, death, his, son, tutankhamun, returned, the, capital, to, memphis, but, renewed, building, projects, at, thebes, produced, even, more, glorious, temples, and, shrines, with, the, 19th, dynasty, the, seat, of, government, moved, to, the, delta, thebes, maintained, its, revenues, and, prestige, through, the, reigns, of, seti, i, 1290, 1279, bc, and, ramesses, ii, 1279, 1213, bc, who, still, resided, for, part, of, every, year, in, thebes, ramesses, ii, carried, out, extensive, building, projects, in, the, city, such, as, statues, and, obelisks, the, third, enclosure, wall, of, karnak, temple, additions, to, the, luxor, temple, and, the, ramesseum, his, grand, mortuary, temple, the, constructions, were, bankrolled, by, the, large, granaries, built, around, the, ramesseum, that, concentrated, the, taxes, collected, from, upper, egypt, and, by, the, gold, from, expeditions, to, nubia, and, the, eastern, desert, during, ramesses, long, 66, year, reign, egypt, and, thebes, reached, an, overwhelming, state, of, prosperity, that, equaled, or, even, surpassed, the, earlier, peak, under, amenhotep, iii, the, city, continued, to, be, well, kept, in, the, early, 20th, dynasty, the, great, harris, papyrus, states, that, ramesses, iii, reigned, 1187, 56, donated, 86, 486, slaves, and, vast, estates, to, the, temples, of, amun, ramesses, iii, received, tributes, from,

of, deir, el, medina, in, the, 25th, year, of, his, reign, workers, in, deir, el, medina, began, striking, for, pay, and, there, arose, a, general, unrest, of, all, social, classes, subsequently, an,

amenhotep, ii, the, finding, of, these, two, hiding, places, in, 1881, and, 1898, respectively, was, one, of, the, great, events, of, modern, archaeological, discovery, such, maladministration, in, thebes, led, to, unrest, control, of, local, affairs, tended, to, come, more, and, more, into, the, hands, of, the, high, priests, of, amun, so, that, during, the, third, intermediate, period, the,
