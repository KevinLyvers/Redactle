the, post, world, war, ii, economic, expansion, also, known, as, the, postwar, economic, boom, or, the, golden, age, of, capitalism, was, a, broad, period, of, worldwide, economic, expansion, beginning, with, the, aftermath, of, world, war, ii, and, ending, with, the, 1973, 1975, recession, the, united, states, the, soviet, union, and, western, european, and, east, asian, countries, in, particular, experienced, unusually, high, and, sustained, growth, together, with, full, employment, contrary, to, early, predictions, this, high, growth, also, included, many, countries, that, had, been, devastated, by, the, war, such, as, japan, japanese, economic, miracle, west, germany, and, austria, wirtschaftswunder, south, korea, miracle, on, the, han, river, belgium, belgian, economic, miracle, france, trente, glorieuses, italy, italian, economic, miracle, and, greece, greek, economic, miracle, even, countries, that, were, relatively, unaffected, by, the, war, such, as, sweden, record, years, experienced, considerable, economic, growth, the, boom, established, the, conditions, for, a, larger, series, of, global, changes, at, the, height, of, the, cold, war, including, postmodernism, decolonisation, a, marked, increase, in, consumerism, the, welfare, state, the, space, race, the, non, aligned, movement, import, substitution, counterculture, of, the, 1960s, the, beginning, of, second, wave, feminism, and, a, nuclear, arms, race, in, 2000, economist, roger, middleton, wrote, that, economic, historians, generally, agree, that, 1950, represented, the, beginning, year, of, the, golden, age, while, robert, skidelsky, states, 1951, is, the, most, recognized, start, date, both, skidelsky, and, middleton, have, 1973, as, the, generally, recognized, end, date, though, sometimes, the, golden, age, is, considered, to, have, ended, as, early, as, 1970, this, long, term, business, cycle, ended, with, a, number, of, events, in, the, early, 1970s, while, this, is, the, global, period, specific, countries, experienced, business, expansions, for, different, periods, in, taiwan, the, taiwan, miracle, lasted, into, the, late, 1990s, for, instance, while, in, france, the, period, is, referred, to, as, trente, glorieuses, glorious, 30, and, is, considered, to, extend, for, the, 30, year, period, from, 1945, to, 1975, oecd, members, enjoyed, real, gdp, growth, averaging, over, 4, per, year, in, the, 1950s, and, nearly, 5, per, year, in, the, 1960s, compared, with, 3, in, the, 1970s, and, 2, in, the, 1980s, skidelsky, devotes, ten, pages, of, his, 2009, book, keynes, the, return, of, the, master, to, a, comparison, of, the, golden, age, to, what, he, calls, the, washington, consensus, period, which, he, dates, as, spanning, 1980, 2009, 1973, 1980, being, a, transitional, period, skidelsky, suggests, the, high, global, growth, during, the, golden, age, was, especially, impressive, as, during, that, period, japan, was, the, only, major, asian, economy, enjoying, high, growth, taiwan, and, south, korea, at, the, time, being, small, economies, it, was, not, until, later, that, the, world, had, the, exceptional, growth, of, china, raising, the, global, average, skidelsky, also, reports, that, inequality, was, generally, decreasing, during, the, golden, age, whereas, since, the, washington, consensus, was, formed, it, has, been, increasing, globally, the, golden, age, was, a, time, of, unusual, financial, stability, with, crises, far, less, frequent, and, intense, than, before, or, after, martin, wolf, reports, that, between, 1945, and, 1971, 27, years, the, world, saw, only, 38, financial, crises, whereas, from, 1973, to, 1997, 24, years, there, were, 139, high, productivity, growth, from, before, the, war, continued, after, the, war, and, until, the, early, 1970s, manufacturing, was, aided, by, automation, technologies, such, as, feedback, controllers, which, appeared, in, the, late, 1930s, were, a, fast, growing, area, of, investment, following, the, war, wholesale, and, retail, trade, benefited, from, new, highway, systems, distribution, warehouses, and, material, handling, equipment, such, as, forklifts, and, intermodal, containers, oil, displaced, coal, in, many, applications, particularly, in, locomotives, and, ships, in, agriculture, the, post, wwii, period, saw, the, widespread, introduction, of, the, following, keynesian, economists, argue, that, the, post, war, expansion, was, caused, by, adoption, of, keynesian, economic, policies, naomi, klein, has, argued, the, high, growth, enjoyed, by, europe, and, america, was, the, result, of, keynesian, economic, policies, and, in, the, case, of, rapidly, rising, prosperity, that, this, post, war, period, saw, in, parts, of, south, america, by, the, influence, of, developmentalist, economics, led, by, ra, l, prebisch, one, of, eisenhower, s, enduring, achievements, was, championing, and, signing, the, bill, that, authorized, the, interstate, highway, system, in, 1956, he, justified, the, project, through, the, federal, aid, highway, act, of, 1956, as, essential, to, american, security, during, the, cold, war, it, was, believed, that, large, cities, would, be, targets, in, a, possible, war, hence, the, highways, were, designed, to, facilitate, their, evacuation, and, ease, military, maneuvers, another, explanation, for, this, period, is, the, theory, of, the, permanent, war, economy, which, suggests, that, the, large, spending, on, the, military, helped, stabilize, the, global, economy, this, has, also, been, referred, to, as, military, keynesianism, this, also, goes, into, hand, with, retired, wwii, vets, with, pensions, to, spend, this, period, also, saw, financial, repression, low, nominal, interest, rates, and, low, or, negative, real, interest, rates, nominal, rates, lower, than, inflation, plus, taxation, via, government, policy, resulting, respectively, in, debt, servicing, costs, being, low, low, nominal, rates, and, in, liquidation, of, existing, debt, via, inflation, and, taxation, this, allowed, countries, such, as, the, us, and, uk, to, deal, with, their, existing, government, debt, level, and, also, to, reduce, the, level, of, debt, without, needing, to, direct, a, high, portion, of, government, spending, to, debt, service, much, property, was, destroyed, in, war, in, the, inter, war, period, the, great, depression, also, caused, investments, to, lose, value, during, both, world, wars, progressive, taxation, and, capital, levies, were, introduced, with, the, generally, stated, aim, of, distributing, the, sacrifices, required, by, the, war, more, evenly, while, tax, rates, dipped, between, the, wars, they, did, not, return, to, pre, war, levels, top, tax, rates, increased, dramatically, in, some, cases, tenfold, this, had, a, significant, effect, on, both, income, and, wealth, distributions, such, policies, were, commonly, referred, to, as, the, conscription, of, income, and, conscription, of, wealth, a, fundamental, objection, to, the, government, s, policy, of, conscription, is, that, it, conscripts, human, life, only, and, that, it, does, not, attempt, to, conscript, wealth, the, economist, a, british, publication, opposed, capital, levies, but, supported, direct, taxation, heavy, enough, to, amount, to, rationing, of, citizens, incomes, similarly, the, american, economist, oliver, mitchell, wentworth, sprague, in, the, economic, journal, argued, that, that, conscription, of, men, should, logically, and, equitably, be, accompanied, by, something, in, the, nature, of, conscription, of, current, income, above, that, which, is, absolutely, necessary, rationing, of, goods, was, also, widely, used, with, the, aim, of, distributing, scarce, resources, efficiently, rationing, was, widely, done, with, ration, stamps, a, second, currency, that, entitled, the, bearer, to, buy, with, regular, money, a, certain, amount, of, a, certain, sort, of, good, for, instance, two, ounces, of, meat, or, a, certain, amount, of, clothing, or, fuel, price, controls, were, also, used, for, instance, the, price, of, restaurant, meals, was, capped, in, the, post, war, period, progressive, taxation, persisted, inheritance, taxes, also, had, an, effect, rationing, in, the, united, kingdom, lasted, until, 1954, allied, war, bonds, matured, during, the, post, war, years, transferring, cash, from, governments, to, private, households, in, japan, progressive, tax, rates, were, imposed, during, the, allied, occupation, at, rates, that, roughly, matched, those, in, the, united, states, at, that, time, high, marginal, tax, rates, for, the, wealthiest, 1, were, in, place, throughout, japan, s, decades, of, post, war, growth, south, korea, after, the, korean, war, saw, a, similar, trajectory, marginal, tax, rates, were, high, on, the, rich, until, falling, quickly, in, the, 1990s, the, state, also, legislated, significant, land, reform, cutting, deeply, into, a, landholding, elite, s, power, and, clientelism, in, the, 1940s, the, price, of, oil, was, about, 17, rising, to, just, over, 20, during, the, korean, war, 1951, 1953, during, the, vietnam, war, 1950s, 1970s, the, price, of, oil, slowly, declined, to, under, 20, during, the, arab, oil, embargo, of, 1973, the, first, oil, shock, the, price, of, oil, rapidly, rose, to, double, in, price, among, the, causes, can, be, mentioned, the, rapid, normalization, of, political, relations, between, former, axis, powers, and, the, western, allies, after, the, war, the, major, powers, were, determined, not, to, repeat, the, mistakes, of, the, great, depression, some, of, which, were, ascribed, to, post, world, war, i, policy, errors, the, marshall, plan, for, the, rebuilding, of, europe, is, most, credited, for, reconciliation, though, the, immediate, post, war, situations, was, more, complicated, in, 1948, the, marshall, plan, pumped, over, 12, billion, to, rebuild, and, modernize, western, europe, the, european, coal, and, steel, community, formed, the, foundation, of, what, was, to, become, the, european, union, in, later, years, institutional, economists, point, to, the, international, institutions, established, in, the, post, war, period, structurally, the, victorious, allies, established, the, united, nations, and, the, bretton, woods, monetary, system, international, institutions, designed, to, promote, stability, this, was, achieved, through, a, number, of, policies, including, promoting, free, trade, instituting, the, marshall, plan, and, the, use, of, keynesian, economics, although, this, was, before, modern, eastern, countries, growing, their, workforce, i, e, before, the, outsourcing, problem, protectionists, point, to, in, the, united, states, the, employment, act, of, 1946, set, the, goals, of, achieving, full, employment, full, production, and, stable, prices, it, also, created, the, council, of, economic, advisers, to, provide, objective, economic, analysis, and, advice, on, the, development, and, implementation, of, a, wide, range, of, domestic, and, international, economic, policy, issues, in, its, first, 7, years, the, cea, made, five, technical, advances, in, policy, making, the, economies, of, the, united, states, japan, west, germany, france, and, italy, did, particularly, well, japan, and, west, germany, caught, up, to, and, exceeded, the, gdp, of, the, united, kingdom, during, these, years, even, as, the, uk, itself, was, experiencing, the, greatest, absolute, prosperity, in, its, history, in, france, this, period, is, often, looked, back, to, with, nostalgia, as, the, trente, glorieuses, or, glorious, thirty, while, the, economies, of, west, germany, and, austria, were, characterized, by, wirtschaftswunder, economic, miracle, and, in, italy, it, is, called, miracolo, economico, economic, miracle, most, developing, countries, also, did, well, in, this, period, belgium, experienced, a, brief, but, very, rapid, economic, recovery, in, the, aftermath, of, world, war, ii, the, comparatively, light, damage, sustained, by, belgium, s, heavy, industry, during, the, german, occupation, and, the, europe, wide, need, for, the, country, s, traditional, exports, steel, and, coal, textiles, and, railway, infrastructure, meant, that, belgium, became, the, first, european, country, to, regain, its, pre, war, level, of, output, in, 1947, economic, growth, in, the, period, was, accompanied, by, low, inflation, and, sharp, increases, in, real, living, standards, however, lack, of, capital, investment, meant, that, belgium, s, heavy, industry, was, ill, equipped, to, compete, with, other, european, industries, in, the, 1950s, this, contributed, to, the, start, of, deindustrialisation, in, wallonia, and, the, emergence, of, regional, economic, disparities, between, 1947, and, 1973, france, went, through, a, boom, period, 5, growth, per, year, on, average, dubbed, by, jean, fourasti, trente, glorieuses, the, title, of, a, book, published, in, 1979, the, economic, growth, occurred, mainly, due, to, productivity, gains, and, to, an, increase, in, the, number, of, working, hours, indeed, the, working, population, grew, very, slowly, the, baby, boom, being, offset, by, the, extension, of, the, time, dedicated, to, study, productivity, gains, came, from, catching, up, with, the, united, states, in, 1950, the, average, income, in, france, was, 55, of, that, of, an, american, it, reached, 80, in, 1973, among, the, major, nations, only, japan, had, faster, growth, in, this, era, than, france, the, extended, period, of, transformation, and, modernization, also, involved, an, increasing, internationalization, of, the, french, economy, france, by, the, 1980s, had, become, a, leading, world, economic, power, and, the, world, s, fourth, largest, exporter, of, manufactured, products, it, became, europe, s, largest, agricultural, producer, and, exporter, accounting, for, more, than, 10, percent, of, world, trade, in, such, goods, by, the, 1980s, the, service, sector, grew, rapidly, and, became, the, largest, sector, generating, a, large, foreign, trade, surplus, chiefly, from, the, earnings, from, tourism, the, italian, economy, experienced, very, variable, growth, in, the, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, the, italian, economy, boomed, with, record, high, growth, rates, including, 6, 4, in, 1959, 5, 8, in, 1960, 6, 8, in, 1961, and, 6, 1, in, 1962, this, rapid, and, sustained, growth, was, due, to, the, ambitions, of, several, italian, businesspeople, the, opening, of, new, industries, helped, by, the, discovery, of, hydrocarbons, made, for, iron, and, steel, in, the, po, valley, re, construction, and, the, modernisation, of, most, italian, cities, such, as, milan, rome, and, turin, and, the, aid, given, to, the, country, after, world, war, ii, notably, through, the, marshall, plan, after, 1950, japan, s, economy, recovered, from, the, war, damage, and, began, to, boom, with, the, fastest, growth, rates, in, the, world, given, a, boost, by, the, korean, war, in, which, it, acted, as, a, major, supplier, to, the, un, force, japan, s, economy, embarked, on, a, prolonged, period, of, extremely, rapid, growth, led, by, the, manufacturing, sectors, japan, emerged, as, a, significant, power, in, many, economic, spheres, including, steel, working, car, manufacturing, and, the, manufacturing, of, electronics, japan, rapidly, caught, up, with, the, west, in, foreign, trade, gnp, and, general, quality, of, life, the, high, economic, growth, and, political, tranquility, of, the, mid, to, late, 1960s, were, slowed, by, the, quadrupling, of, oil, prices, in, 1973, almost, completely, dependent, on, imports, for, petroleum, japan, experienced, its, first, recession, since, world, war, ii, another, serious, problem, was, japan, s, growing, trade, surplus, which, reached, record, heights, the, united, states, pressured, japan, to, remedy, the, imbalance, demanding, that, tokyo, raise, the, value, of, the, yen, and, open, its, markets, further, to, facilitate, more, imports, from, the, united, states, in, early, 1950s, the, soviet, union, having, reconstructed, the, ruins, left, by, the, war, experienced, a, decade, of, prosperous, undisturbed, and, rapid, economic, growth, with, significant, and, remarkable, technological, achievements, most, notably, the, first, earth, satellite, the, nation, made, it, to, the, top, 15, countries, with, highest, gdp, per, capita, in, the, mid, 1950s, however, the, growth, slowed, by, the, mid, 1960s, as, the, government, started, pouring, resources, into, large, military, and, space, projects, and, the, civilian, sector, gradually, languished, while, every, other, major, nation, greatly, expanded, its, service, sector, in, the, soviet, union, it, was, given, low, priority, following, khrushchev, s, ouster, and, the, appointment, of, a, collective, leadership, led, by, leonid, brezhnev, and, alexei, kosygin, the, economy, was, revitalised, the, economy, continued, to, grow, apace, during, the, late, 1960s, during, the, eighth, five, year, plan, however, economic, growth, began, to, falter, during, the, late, 1970s, beginning, the, era, of, stagnation, sweden, emerged, almost, unharmed, from, world, war, ii, and, experienced, tremendous, economic, growth, until, the, early, 1970s, as, social, democratic, prime, minister, tage, erlander, held, his, office, from, 1946, to, 1969, sweden, used, to, be, a, country, of, emigrants, until, the, 1930s, but, the, demand, for, labor, spurred, immigration, to, sweden, especially, from, finland, and, countries, like, greece, italy, and, yugoslavia, urbanization, was, fast, and, housing, shortage, in, urban, areas, was, imminent, until, the, million, programme, was, launched, in, the, 1960s, a, 1957, speech, by, uk, prime, minister, harold, macmillan, captures, what, the, golden, age, felt, like, even, before, the, brightest, years, which, were, to, come, in, the, 1960s, let, us, be, frank, about, it, most, of, our, people, have, never, had, it, so, good, go, round, the, country, go, to, the, industrial, towns, go, to, the, farms, and, you, will, see, a, state, of, prosperity, such, as, we, have, never, had, in, my, lifetime, nor, indeed, in, the, history, of, this, country, unemployment, figures, show, that, unemployment, was, significantly, lower, during, the, golden, age, than, before, or, after, in, addition, to, superior, economic, performance, other, social, indexes, were, higher, in, the, golden, age, for, example, the, proportion, of, britain, s, population, saying, they, were, very, happy, fell, from, 52, in, 1957, to, just, 36, in, 2005, the, period, from, the, end, of, world, war, ii, to, the, early, 1970s, was, one, of, the, greatest, eras, of, economic, expansion, in, world, history, in, the, us, gross, domestic, product, increased, from, 228, billion, in, 1945, to, just, under, 1, 7, trillion, in, 1975, by, 1975, the, us, economy, represented, some, 35, of, the, entire, world, industrial, output, and, the, us, economy, was, over, 3, times, larger, than, that, of, japan, the, next, largest, economy, the, expansion, was, interrupted, in, the, united, states, by, five, recessions, 1948, 49, 1953, 54, 1957, 58, 1960, 61, and, 1969, 70, 200, billion, in, war, bonds, matured, and, the, g, i, bill, financed, a, well, educated, work, force, the, middle, class, swelled, as, did, gdp, and, productivity, the, us, underwent, its, own, golden, age, of, economic, growth, this, growth, was, distributed, fairly, evenly, across, the, economic, classes, which, some, attribute, to, the, strength, of, labor, unions, in, this, period, labor, union, membership, peaked, during, the, 1950s, much, of, the, growth, came, from, the, movement, of, low, income, farm, workers, into, better, paying, jobs, in, the, towns, and, cities, a, process, largely, completed, by, 1960, west, germany, under, chancellor, konrad, adenauer, and, economic, minister, ludwig, erhard, saw, prolonged, economic, growth, beginning, in, the, early, 1950s, journalists, dubbed, it, the, wirtschaftswunder, or, economic, miracle, industrial, production, doubled, from, 1950, to, 1957, and, gross, national, product, grew, at, a, rate, of, 9, or, 10, per, year, providing, the, engine, for, economic, growth, of, all, of, western, europe, labor, unions, support, of, the, new, policies, postponed, wage, increases, minimized, strikes, supported, technological, modernization, and, a, policy, of, co, determination, mitbestimmung, which, involved, a, satisfactory, grievance, resolution, system, and, required, the, representation, of, workers, on, the, boards, of, large, corporations, all, contributed, to, such, a, prolonged, economic, growth, the, recovery, was, accelerated, by, the, currency, reform, of, june, 1948, us, gifts, of, 1, 4, billion, marshall, plan, aid, the, breaking, down, of, old, trade, barriers, and, traditional, practices, and, the, opening, of, the, global, market, west, germany, gained, legitimacy, and, respect, as, it, shed, the, horrible, reputation, germany, had, gained, under, the, nazis, west, germany, played, a, central, role, in, the, creation, of, european, cooperation, it, joined, nato, in, 1955, and, was, a, founding, member, of, the, european, economic, community, in, 1958, the, post, war, economic, boom, had, many, social, cultural, and, political, effects, not, least, of, which, was, the, demographic, bulge, termed, the, baby, boom, movements, and, phenomena, associated, with, this, period, include, the, height, of, the, cold, war, postmodernism, decolonisation, a, marked, increase, in, consumerism, the, welfare, state, the, space, race, the, non, aligned, movement, import, substitution, counterculture, of, the, 1960s, opposition, to, the, vietnam, war, the, civil, rights, movement, the, sexual, revolution, the, beginning, of, second, wave, feminism, and, a, nuclear, arms, race, in, the, united, states, the, middle, class, began, a, mass, migration, away, from, the, cities, and, towards, the, suburbs, it, was, a, period, of, prosperity, in, which, most, people, could, enjoy, a, job, for, life, a, house, and, a, family, in, the, west, there, emerged, a, near, complete, consensus, against, strong, ideology, and, a, belief, that, technocratic, and, scientific, solutions, could, be, found, to, most, of, humanity, s, problems, a, view, advanced, by, us, president, john, f, kennedy, in, 1962, this, optimism, was, symbolized, through, such, events, as, the, 1964, new, york, world, s, fair, and, lyndon, b, johnson, s, great, society, programs, which, aimed, at, eliminating, poverty, in, the, united, states, the, sharp, rise, in, oil, prices, due, to, the, 1973, oil, crisis, hastened, the, transition, to, the, post, industrial, economy, and, a, multitude, of, social, problems, have, since, emerged, during, the, 1970s, steel, crisis, demand, for, steel, declined, and, the, western, world, faced, competition, from, newly, industrialized, countries, this, was, especially, harsh, for, mining, and, steel, districts, such, as, the, north, american, rust, belt, and, the, west, german, ruhr, area
