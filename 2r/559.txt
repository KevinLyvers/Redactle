of, socialism, and, the, new, constitution, accordingly, adopted, the, name, change, from, czechoslovak, republic, to, czechoslovak, socialist, republic, the, pace, of, de, stalinization, however, was, sluggish, the, rehabilitation, of, stalinist, era, victims, such, as, those, convicted, in, the, sl, nsk, trial, may, have, been, considered, as, early, as, 1963, but, did, not, take, place,

conference, was, unique, because, it, symbolized, kafka, s, rehabilitation, in, the, eastern, bloc, after, having, been, heavily, criticized, led, to, a, partial, opening, up, of, the, regime, and, influenced, the, relaxation, of, censorship, it, also, had, an, international, impact, as, a, representative, from, all, eastern, bloc, countries, were, invited, to, the, conference, only, the,

to, air, discontent, in, liter, rn, noviny, the, union, s, previously, hard, line, communist, weekly, members, suggested, that, literature, should, be, independent, of, the, communist, party,

kohout, and, ivan, kl, ma, a, few, months, later, at, a, meeting, of, party, leaders, it, was, decided, that, administrative, actions, against, the, writers, who, openly, expressed, support, of, reformation, would, be, taken, since, only, a, small, group, of, the, union, held, these, beliefs, the, remaining, members, were, relied, upon, to, discipline, their, colleagues, control, over, liter, rn, noviny, and, several, other, publishers, was, transferred, to, the, ministry, of, culture, and, even, some, leaders, of, the, party, who, later, became, major, reformers, including, dub, ek,

december, seeking, support, brezhnev, however, was, surprised, at, the, extent, of, the, opposition, to, novotn, and, so, he, rather, supported, his, removal, dub, ek, replaced, novotn, as, first, secretary, on, 5, january, 1968, on, 22, march, novotn, resigned, and, was, replaced, by, ludv, k, svoboda, who, later, gave, consent, to, the, reforms, early, signs, of, change, were, few, in, an, interview, with, ks, presidium, member, josef, smrkovsk, published, in, the, party, newspaper, rud, pr, vo, with, the, title, what, lies, ahead, he, insisted, that, dub, ek, s, appointment, at, the, january, plenum, would, further, the, goals, of, socialism, and, maintain, the, working, class, nature, of, the, party, however, right, after, dub, ek, assumed, power, the, scholar, eduard, goldst, cker, became, chairman, of, the, union, of, czechoslovak, writers, and, thus, editor, in, chief, of, liter, rn, noviny, which, under, novotn, had, been, filled, with, party, loyalists, goldst, cker, tested, the, boundaries, of, dub, ek, s, devotion, to, freedom, of, the, press, when, on, 4, february, he, appeared, in, a, television, interview, as, the, new, head, of, the, union, during, the, interview, he, openly, criticized, novotn, exposing, all, of, novotn, s, previously, unreported, policies, and, explaining, how, they, were, preventing, progress, in, czechoslovakia, goldst, cker, suffered, no, repercussions, dub, ek, instead, began, to, build, a, sense, of, trust, among, the, media, the, government, and, the, citizens, it, was, under, goldst, cker, that, the, journal, s, name, was, changed, to, liter, rn, listy, and, on, 29, february, the, union, published, the, first, copy, of, the, censor, free, journal, by, august, liter, rn, listy, had, a, circulation, of, 300, 000,

following, the, triumph, of, socialism, he, emphasized, the, need, to, enforce, the, leading, role, of, the, party, more, effectively, in, april, dub, ek, launched, an, action, programme, of, liberalizations, which, included, increasing, freedom, of, the, press, freedom, of, speech, and, freedom, of, movement, with, economic, emphasis, on, consumer, goods, and, the, possibility, of, a, multiparty, government, the, programme, was, based, on, the, view, that, socialism, cannot, mean, only, liberation, of, the, working, people, from, the, domination, of, exploiting, class, relations, but, must, make, more, provisions, for, a, fuller, life, of, the, personality, than, any, bourgeois, democracy, it, would, limit, the, power, of, the, secret, police, and, provide, for, the, federalization, of, the, ssr, into, two, equal, nations, the, programme, also, covered, foreign, policy, including, both, the, maintenance, of, good, relations, with, western, countries, and, cooperation, with, the, soviet, union, and, other, eastern, bloc, nations, it, spoke, of, a, ten, year, transition, through, which, democratic, elections, would, be, made, possible, and, a, new, form, of, democratic, socialism, would, replace, the, status, quo, those, who, drafted, the, action, programme, were, careful, not, to, criticize, the, actions, of, the, post, war, communist, regime, only, to, point, out, policies, that, they, felt, had, outlived, their, usefulness, although, it, was, stipulated, that, reform, must, proceed, under, ks, direction, popular, pressure, mounted, to, implement, reforms, immediately, radical, elements, became, more, vocal, anti, soviet, polemics, appeared, in, the, press, on, 26, june, 1968, and, new, unaffiliated, political, clubs, were, created,

party, rule, freedom, of, the, press, opened, the, door, for, the, first, look, at, czechoslovakia, s, past, by, czechoslovakia, s, people, many, of, the, investigations, centered, on, the, country, s, history, under, communism, especially, in, the, instance, of, the, stalinist, period, in, another, television, appearance, goldst, cker, presented, both, doctored, and, undoctored, photographs, of, former, communist, leaders, who, had, been, purged, imprisoned, or, executed, and, thus, erased, from, communist, history, the, writers, union, also, formed, a, committee, in, april, 1968, headed, by,

bookstores, and, libraries, and, the, literary, world, discussions, on, the, current, state, of, communism, and, abstract, ideas, such, as, freedom, and, identity, were, also, becoming, more, common, soon, non, party, publications, began, appearing, such, as, the, trade, union, daily, pr, ce, labour, this, was, also, helped, by, the, journalists, union, which, by, march, 1968, had, already, persuaded, the, central, publication, board, the, government, censor, to, allow, editors, to, receive, uncensored, subscriptions, to, foreign, papers, allowing, for, a, more, international, dialogue, around, the, news, the, press, the, radio, and, the, television, also, contributed, to, these, discussions, by, hosting, meetings, where, students, and, young, workers, could, ask, questions, of, writers, such, as, goldst, cker, pavel, kohout, and, jan, proch, zka, and, political, victims, such, as, josef, smrkovsk, zden, k, hejzlar, and, gust, v, hus, k, television, also, broadcast, meetings,

the, reforms, which, they, feared, might, weaken, the, position, of, the, bloc, in, the, cold, war, at, a, meeting, in, dresden, east, germany, on, 23, march, the, leaders, of, the, warsaw, five, ussr, hungary, poland, bulgaria, and, east, germany, questioned, the, czechoslovak, delegation, over, the, planned, reforms, suggesting, any, talk, of, democratization, was, a, veiled, criticism, of, the, soviet, model, the, polish, party, leader, w, adys, aw, gomu, ka, and, j, nos, k, d, r, were, less, concerned, with, the, reforms, themselves, than, with, the, growing, criticisms, levelled, by, the, czechoslovak, media, and, worried, that, the, situation, might, be, similar, to, the, hungarian, counterrevolution, some, of, the, language, in, the, action, programme, may, have, been, chosen, to, assert, that, no, counterrevolution, was, planned, but, kieran, williams, suggests, that, dub, ek, was, perhaps, surprised, at, but, not, resentful, of, soviet, suggestions, in, may, the, kgb, initiated, operation, progress, which, involved, soviet, agents, infiltrating, czechoslovak, pro, democratic, organizations, such, as, the, socialist, and, christian, democrat, parties, the, soviet,

is, often, considered, a, painful, defeat, a, symbol, of, disappointed, hope, and, surrender, that, heralds, twenty, years, of, normalisation, it, was, not, until, the, 2000s, following, the, publication, of, texts, dating, from, 1968, such, as, milan, kundera, esk, d, l, the, czech, fate, and, v, clav, havel, esk, d, l, published, in, 2007, in, the, weekly, magazine, liter, rn, noviny,

prague, spring, is, thus, largely, obscured, and, often, overviewed, indeed, the, prague, spring, also, deeply, impacted, the, czech, society, and, should, also, be, remembered, for, the, cultural, momentum, that, accompanied, and, illustrated, this, movement, of, which, there, are, still, films, novels, and, plays, the, prague, spring, also, influenced, a, renewal, of, the, prague, artistic, and, cultural, scene, as, well, as, a, liberalization, of, society, which, deeply, marked, the, following, years, the, 1960s, indeed, saw, the, emergence, of, a, major, shift, in, czechoslovakia, with, cultural, changes, and, movement, coming, from, the, west, notably, rock, music, and, sub, cultural, movements, which, are, the, symbol, of, cultural, renewal, for, czechoslovakia, the, czech, sixties, were, thus, a, process, of, emancipation, of, culture, from, the, constraints, of, existing, political, structures, and, were, the, prelude, to, the, upheavals, of, 1968, in, fact, the, regime, s, political, crisis, did, not, begin, with, dubcek, s, election, as, party, leader, on, 5, january, 1968, but, with, the, break, up, speeches, delivered, at, the, writers, congress, in, june, 1967, by, ludv, k, vacul, k, milan, kundera, and, anton, n, liehm, in, addition, the, revitalization, of, society, was, also, an, essential, component, of, the, prague, spring, indeed, the, great, achievements, of, the, prague, spring, i, e, the, abolition, of, censorship, the, restoration, of, individual, and, collective, freedoms, have, revitalized, society, which, has, begun, to, express, itself, more, freely, although, the, prague, spring, only, restored, what, had, existed, thirty, years, earlier, in, czechoslovakia, the, spring, of, 1968, had, a, profound, and, long, lasting, impact, on, the, society, recently, the, anniversary, of, the, 50, years, of, the, conflict, raised, the, question, of, the, memory, of, the, prague, spring, the, european, commission, vice,
