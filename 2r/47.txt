after, the, fall, of, the, hittites, the, new, states, of, phrygia, and, lydia, stood, strong, on, the, western, coast, as, greek, civilization, began, to, flourish, they, and, all, the, rest, of,

control, to, govern, effectively, and, providing, military, protection, in, the, early, 4th, century, constantine, the, great, established, a, new, administrative, centre, at, constantinople, and, by, the, end, of, the, 4th, century, the, roman, empire, split, into, two, parts, the, eastern, part, romania, with, constantinople, as, its, capital, referred, to, by, historians, as, the, byzantine, empire, from, the, original, name, byzantium, the, thracians, ancient, greek, latin, thraci, were, a, group, of, indo, european, tribes, inhabiting, a, large, area, in, central, and, southeastern, europe, they, were, bordered, by, the, scythians, to, the, north, the, celts, and, the, illyrians, to, the, west, the, ancient, greeks, to, the, south, and, the, black, sea, to, the, east, they, spoke, the, thracian, language, a, scarcely, attested, branch, of, the, indo, european, language, family, the, study, of, thracians, and, thracian, culture, is, known, as, thracology, starting, around, 1200, bc, the, western, coast, of, anatolia, was, heavily, settled, by, aeolian, and, ionian, greeks, numerous, important, cities, were, founded, by, these, colonists, such, as, miletus, ephesus, smyrna, and, byzantium, the, latter, founded, by, greek, colonists, from, megara, in, 657, bc, all, of, thrace, and, the, native, thracian, peoples, were, conquered, by, darius, the, great, in, the, late, 6th, century, bc, and, were, re, subjugated, into, the, empire, in, 492, bc, following, mardonius, campaign, during, the, first, persian, invasion, of, greece, the, territory, of, thrace, later, became, unified, by, the, odrysian, kingdom, founded, by, teres, i, probably, after, the, persian, defeat, in, greece, by, the, 5th, century, bc, the, thracian, presence, was, pervasive, enough, to, have, made, herodotus, call, them, the, second, most, numerous, people, in, the, part, of, the, world, known, by, him, after, the, indians, and, potentially, the, most, powerful, if, not, for, their, lack, of, unity, the, thracians, in, classical, times, were, broken, up, into, a, large, number, of, groups, and, tribes, though, a, number, of, powerful, thracian, states, were, organized, such, as, the, odrysian, kingdom, of, thrace, and, the, dacian, kingdom, of, burebista, a, type, of, soldier, of, this, period, called, the, peltast, probably, originated, in, thrace, before, the, expansion, of, the, kingdom, of, macedon, thrace, was, divided, into, three, camps, east, central, and, west, after, the, withdrawal, of, the, persians, following, their, eventual, defeat, in, mainland, greece, cersobleptes, a, notable, ruler, of, the, east, thracians, attempted, to, expand, his, authority, over, many, of, the, thracian, tribes, but, was, eventually, defeated, by, the, macedonians, the, thracians, were, typically, not, city, builders, the, largest, thracian, cities, were, in, fact, large, villages, and, the, only, polis, was, seuthopolis, the, persian, achaemenid, empire, fell, to, alexander, the, great, in, 334, bc, which, led, to, increasing, cultural, homogeneity, and, hellenization, in, the, area, following, alexander, s, death, in, 323, bc, anatolia, was, subsequently, divided, into, a, number, of, small, hellenistic, kingdoms, all, of, which, became, part, of, the, roman, republic, by, the, mid, 1st, century, bc, the, process, of, hellenization, that, began, with, alexander, s, conquest, accelerated, under, roman, rule, and, by, the, early, centuries, ad, the, local, anatolian, languages, and, cultures, had, become, extinct, being, largely, replaced, by, ancient, greek, language, and, culture, in, 324, constantine, i, chose, byzantium, to, be, the, new, capital, of, the, roman, empire, renaming, it, new, rome, following, the, death, of, theodosius, i, in, 395, and, the, permanent, division, of, the, roman, empire, between, his, two, sons, the, city, which, would, popularly, come, to, be, known, as, constantinople, became, the, capital, of, the, eastern, roman, empire, this, which, would, later, be, branded, by, historians, as, the, byzantine, empire, ruled, most, of, the, territory, of, what, is, today, turkey, until, the, late, middle, ages, while, the, other, remaining, territory, remained, in, sassanid, persian, hands, between, the, 3rd, and, 7th, century, ad, the, byzantines, and, the, neighboring, sassanids, frequently, clashed, over, possession, of, anatolia, which, significantly, exhausted, both, empires, thus, laying, the, way, open, for, the, eventual, muslim, conquests, from, both, empires, respective, south, the, borders, of, the, empire, fluctuated, through, several, cycles, of, decline, and, recovery, during, the, reign, of, justinian, i, r, 527, 565, the, empire, reached, its, greatest, extent, after, the, fall, of, the, west, re, conquering, much, of, the, historically, roman, western, mediterranean, coast, including, africa, italy, and, rome, which, it, held, for, two, more, centuries, the, byzantine, sasanian, war, of, 602, 628, exhausted, the, empire, s, resources, and, during, the, early, muslim, conquests, of, the, 7th, century, it, lost, its, richest, provinces, egypt, and, syria, to, the, rashidun, caliphate, it, then, lost, africa, to, the, umayyads, in, 698, before, the, empire, was, rescued, by, the, isaurian, dynasty, the, fall, of,

besieged, in, 1461, the, last, byzantine, rump, state, the, principality, of, theodoro, was, conquered, by, the, ottomans, in, 1475, tokhara, yabghus, turk, shahis, historians, generally, agree, that, the, first, turkic, people, lived, in, a, region, extending, from, central, asia, to, siberia, historically, they, were, established, after, the, 6th, century, bc, the, earliest, separate, turkic, peoples, appeared, on, the, peripheries, of, the, late, xiongnu, confederation, about, 200, bc, contemporaneous, with, the, chinese, han, dynasty, the, first, mention, of, turks, was, in, a, chinese, text, that, mentioned, trade, of, turk, tribes, with, the, sogdians, along, the, silk, road, it, has, often, been, suggested, that, the, xiongnu, mentioned, in, han, dynasty, records, were, proto, turkic, speakers, the, hun, hordes, of, attila, who, invaded, and, conquered, much, of, europe, in, the, 5th, century, ad, may, have, been, turkic, and, descendants, of, the, xiongnu, some, scholars, argue, that, the, huns, were, one, of, the, earlier, turkic, tribes, while, others, argue, that, they, were, of, mongolic, origin, in, the, 6th, century, 400, years, after, the, collapse, of, northern, xiongnu, power, in, inner, asia, leadership, of, the, turkic, peoples, was, taken, over, by, the, g, kt, rks, formerly, in, the, xiongnu, nomadic, confederation, the, g, kt, rks, inherited,
