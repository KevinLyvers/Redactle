second, french, empire, and, the, north, german, confederation, led, by, the, kingdom, of, prussia, lasting, from, 19, july, 1870, to, 28, january, 1871, the, conflict, was, caused, primarily, by, france, s, determination, to, reassert, its, dominant, position, in, continental, europe, which, appeared, in, question, following, the, decisive, prussian, victory, over, austria, in, 1866, according, to, some, historians, prussian, chancellor, otto, von, bismarck, deliberately, provoked, the, french, into, declaring, war, on, prussia, in, order, to, induce, four, independent, southern, german, states, baden, w, rttemberg, bavaria, and, hesse, darmstadt, to, join, the, north, german, confederation, other, historians, contend, that, bismarck, exploited, the, circumstances, as, they, unfolded, all, agree, that, bismarck, recognized, the, potential, for, new, german, alliances, given, the, situation, as, a, whole, france, mobilised, its, army, on, 15, july, 1870, leading, the, north, german, confederation, to, respond, with, its, own, mobilisation, later, that, day, on, 16, july, 1870, the, french, parliament, voted, to, declare, war, on, prussia, france, invaded, german, territory, on, 2, august, the, german, coalition, mobilised, its, troops, much, more, effectively, than, the, french, and, invaded, northeastern, france, on, 4, august, german, forces, were, superior, in, numbers, training, and, leadership, and, made, more, effective, use, of, modern, technology, particularly, railways, and, artillery, a, series, of, hard, fought, prussian, and, german, victories, in, eastern, france, culminating, in, the, siege, of, metz, and, the, battle, of, sedan, resulted, in, the, capture, of, the, french, emperor, napoleon, iii, and, the, decisive, defeat, of, the, army, of, the, second, empire, a, government, of, national, defense, was, formed, in, paris, on, 4, september, and, continued, the, war, for, another, five, months, german, forces, fought, and, defeated, new, french, armies, in, northern, france, then, besieged, paris, for, over, four, months, before, it, fell, on, 28, january, 1871, effectively, ending, the, war, in, the, final, days, of, the, war, with, german, victory, all, but, assured, the, german, states, proclaimed, their, union, as, the, german, empire, under, the, prussian, king, wilhelm, i, and, chancellor, bismarck, with, the, notable, exceptions, of, austria, and, german, switzerland, the, vast, majority, of, german, speakers, were, united, under, a, nation, state, for, the, first, time, following, an, armistice, with, france, the, treaty, of, frankfurt, was, signed, on, 10, may, 1871, giving, germany, billions, of, francs, in, war, indemnity, as, well, as, most, of, alsace, and, parts, of, lorraine, which, became, the, imperial, territory, of, alsace, lorraine, reichsland, elsa, lothringen, the, war, had, a, lasting, impact, on, europe, by, hastening, german, unification, the, war, significantly, altered, the, balance, of, power, on, the, continent, with, the, new, german, state, supplanting, france, as, the, dominant, european, land, power, bismarck, maintained, great, authority, in, international, affairs, for, two, decades, developing, a, reputation, for, realpolitik, that, raised, germany, s, global, stature, and, influence, in, france, it, brought, a, final, end, to, imperial, rule, and, began, the, first, lasting, republican, government, resentment, over, the, french, government, s, handling, of, the, war, and, its, aftermath, triggered, the, paris, commune, a, revolutionary, uprising, which, seized, and, held, power, for, two, months, before, its, suppression, the, event, would, influence, the, politics, and, policies, of, the, third, republic, the, causes, of, the, franco, prussian, war, are, rooted, in, the, events, surrounding, the, lead, up, to, the, unification, of, the, german, states, under, otto, von, bismarck, france, had, gained, the, status, of, being, the, dominant, power, of, continental, europe, as, a, result, of, the, franco, austrian, war, of, 1859, during, the, austro, prussian, war, of, 1866, the, empress, eug, nie, foreign, minister, drouyn, de, lhuys, and, war, minister, jacques, louis, randon, were, concerned, that, the, power, of, prussia, might, overtake, that, of, france, they, unsuccessfully, urged, napoleon, to, mass, troops, at, france, s, eastern, borders, while, the, bulk, of, the, prussian, armies, were, still, engaged, in, bohemia, as, a, warning, that, no, territorial, changes, could, be, effected, in, germany, without, consulting, france, as, a, result, of, prussia, s, annexation, of, several, german, states, which, had, sided, with, austria, during, the, war, and, the, formation, of, the, north, german, confederation, under, prussia, s, aegis, french, public, opinion, stiffened, and, now, demanded, more, firmness, as, well, as, territorial, compensations, as, a, result, napoleon, demanded, from, prussia, a, return, to, the, french, borders, of, 1814, with, the, annexation, of, luxembourg, most, of, saarland, and, the, bavarian, palatinate, bismarck, flatly, refused, what, he, disdainfully, termed, france, s, politique, des, pourboires, tipping, policy, he, then, communicated, napoleon, s, written, territorial, demands, to, bavaria, and, the, other, southern, german, states, of, w, rttemberg, baden, and, hesse, darmstadt, which, hastened, the, conclusion, of, defensive, military, alliances, with, these, states, france, had, been, strongly, opposed, to, any, further, alliance, of, german, states, which, would, have, threatened, french, continental, dominance, the, only, result, of, french, policy, was, the, consent, of, prussia, to, nominal, independence, for, saxony, bavaria, wurttemberg, baden, and, hessia, darmstadt, this, was, a, small, victory, and, one, without, appeal, to, a, french, public, which, wanted, territory, and, a, french, army, which, wanted, revenge, the, situation, did, not, suit, either, france, which, unexpectedly, found, itself, next, to, the, militarily, powerful, prussian, led, north, german, confederation, or, prussia, whose, foremost, objective, was, to, complete, the, process, of, uniting, the, german, states, under, its, control, thus, war, between, the, two, powers, since, 1866, was, only, a, matter, of, time, in, prussia, some, officials, considered, a, war, against, france, both, inevitable, and, necessary, to, arouse, german, nationalism, in, those, states, that, would, allow, the, unification, of, a, great, german, empire, this, aim, was, epitomized, by, prussian, chancellor, otto, von, bismarck, s, later, statement, i, did, not, doubt, that, a, franco, german, war, must, take, place, before, the, construction, of, a, united, germany, could, be, realised, bismarck, also, knew, that, france, should, be, the, aggressor, in, the, conflict, to, bring, the, four, southern, german, states, to, side, with, prussia, hence, giving, germans, numerical, superiority, he, was, convinced, that, france, would, not, find, any, allies, in, her, war, against, germany, for, the, simple, reason, that, france, the, victor, would, be, a, danger, to, everybody, prussia, to, nobody, and, he, added, that, is, our, strong, point, many, germans, also, viewed, the, french, as, the, traditional, destabilizer, of, europe, and, sought, to, weaken, france, to, prevent, further, breaches, of, the, peace, the, immediate, cause, of, the, war, was, the, candidacy, of, leopold, of, hohenzollern, sigmaringen, to, the, throne, of, spain, france, feared, an, encirclement, resulting, from, an, alliance, between, prussia, and, spain, the, hohenzollern, prince, s, candidacy, was, withdrawn, under, french, diplomatic, pressure, but, otto, von, bismarck, goaded, the, french, into, declaring, war, by, releasing, an, altered, summary, of, the, ems, dispatch, a, telegram, sent, by, william, i, rejecting, french, demands, that, prussia, never, again, support, a, hohenzollern, candidacy, bismarck, s, summary, as, mistranslated, by, the, french, press, havas, made, it, sound, as, if, the, king, had, treated, the, french, envoy, in, a, demeaning, fashion, which, inflamed, public, opinion, in, france, french, historians, fran, ois, roth, and, pierre, milza, argue, that, napoleon, iii, was, pressured, by, a, bellicose, press, and, public, opinion, and, thus, sought, war, in, response, to, france, s, diplomatic, failures, to, obtain, any, territorial, gains, following, the, austro, prussian, war, napoleon, iii, believed, he, would, win, a, conflict, with, prussia, many, in, his, court, such, as, empress, eug, nie, also, wanted, a, victorious, war, to, resolve, growing, domestic, political, problems, restore, france, as, the, undisputed, leading, power, in, europe, and, ensure, the, long, term, survival, of, the, house, of, bonaparte, a, national, plebiscite, held, on, 8, may, 1870, which, returned, results, overwhelmingly, in, favor, of, the, emperor, s, domestic, agenda, gave, the, impression, that, the, regime, was, politically, popular, and, in, a, position, to, confront, prussia, within, days, of, the, plebiscite, france, s, pacifist, foreign, minister, napol, on, comte, daru, was, replaced, by, agenor, duc, de, gramont, a, fierce, opponent, of, prussia, who, as, french, ambassador, to, austria, in, 1866, had, advocated, an, austro, french, military, alliance, against, prussia, napoleon, iii, s, worsening, health, problems, made, him, less, and, less, capable, of, reining, in, empress, eug, nie, gramont, and, the, other, members, of, the, war, party, known, collectively, as, the, mameluks, for, bismarck, the, nomination, of, gramont, was, seen, as, a, highly, bellicose, symptom, the, ems, telegram, of, 13, july, 1870, had, exactly, the, effect, on, french, public, opinion, that, bismarck, had, intended, this, text, produced, the, effect, of, a, red, flag, on, the, gallic, bull, bismarck, later, wrote, gramont, the, french, foreign, minister, declared, that, he, felt, he, had, just, received, a, slap, the, leader, of, the, monarchists, in, parliament, adolphe, thiers, spoke, for, moderation, arguing, that, france, had, won, the, diplomatic, battle, and, there, was, no, reason, for, war, but, he, was, drowned, out, by, cries, that, he, was, a, traitor, and, a, prussian, napoleon, s, new, prime, minister, emile, ollivier, declared, that, france, had, done, all, that, it, could, humanly, and, honorably, do, to, prevent, the, war, and, that, he, accepted, the, responsibility, with, a, light, heart, a, crowd, of, 15, 000, 20, 000, people, carrying, flags, and, patriotic, banners, marched, through, the, streets, of, paris, demanding, war, french, mobilization, was, ordered, early, on, 15, july, upon, receiving, news, of, the, french, mobilization, the, north, german, confederation, mobilized, on, the, night, of, 15, 16, july, while, bavaria, and, baden, did, likewise, on, 16, july, and, w, rttemberg, on, 17, july, on, 19, july, 1870, the, french, sent, a, declaration, of, war, to, the, prussian, government, the, southern, german, states, immediately, sided, with, prussia, napoleonic, france, had, no, documented, alliance, with, other, powers, and, entered, the, war, virtually, without, allies, the, calculation, was, for, a, victorious, offensive, which, as, the, french, foreign, minister, gramont, stated, was, the, only, way, for, france, to, lure, the, wary, austrians, italians, and, danes, into, the, french, alliance, the, involvement, of, russia, on, the, side, of, france, was, not, considered, by, her, at, all, since, russia, made, the, lifting, of, restrictions, on, its, naval, construction, on, the, black, sea, imposed, on, russia, by, the, treaty, of, paris, following, the, crimean, war, a, precondition, for, the, union, but, imperial, france, was, not, ready, to, do, this, bonaparte, did, not, dare, to, encroach, on, the, paris, treaty, the, worse, things, turned, out, in, the, present, the, more, precious, the, heritage, of, the, past, became, the, french, army, consisted, in, peacetime, of, approximately, 426, 000, soldiers, some, of, them, regulars, others, conscripts, who, until, march, 1869, were, selected, by, ballot, and, served, for, the, comparatively, long, period, of, seven, years, some, of, them, were, veterans, of, previous, french, campaigns, in, the, crimean, war, algeria, the, franco, austrian, war, in, italy, and, in, the, mexican, campaign, however, following, the, seven, weeks, war, between, prussia, and, austria, four, years, earlier, it, had, been, calculated, that, with, commitments, in, algeria, and, elsewhere, the, french, army, could, field, only, 288, 000, men, to, face, the, prussian, army, when, potentially, 1, 000, 000, would, be, required, under, marshal, adolphe, niel, urgent, reforms, were, made, universal, conscription, and, a, shorter, period, of, service, gave, increased, numbers, of, reservists, who, would, swell, the, army, to, a, planned, strength, of, 800, 000, on, mobilisation, those, who, for, any, reason, were, not, conscripted, were, to, be, enrolled, in, the, garde, mobile, a, militia, with, a, nominal, strength, of, 400, 000, however, the, franco, prussian, war, broke, out, before, these, reforms, could, be, completely, implemented, the, mobilisation, of, reservists, was, chaotic, and, resulted, in, large, numbers, of, stragglers, while, the, garde, mobile, were, generally, untrained, and, often, mutinous, french, infantry, were, equipped, with, the, breech, loading, chassepot, rifle, one, of, the, most, modern, mass, produced, firearms, in, the, world, at, the, time, with, 1, 037, 555, available, in, french, inventories, with, a, rubber, ring, seal, and, a, smaller, bullet, the, chassepot, had, a, maximum, effective, range, of, some, 1, 500, metres, 4, 900, ft, with, a, short, reloading, time, french, tactics, emphasised, the, defensive, use, of, the, chassepot, rifle, in, trench, warfare, style, fighting, the, so, called, feu, de, bataillon, the, artillery, was, equipped, with, rifled, muzzle, loaded, la, hitte, guns, the, army, also, possessed, a, precursor, to, the, machine, gun, the, mitrailleuse, which, could, unleash, significant, concentrated, firepower, but, nevertheless, lacked, range, and, was, comparatively, immobile, and, thus, prone, to, being, easily, overrun, the, mitrailleuse, was, mounted, on, an, artillery, gun, carriage, and, grouped, in, batteries, in, a, similar, fashion, to, cannon, the, army, was, nominally, led, by, napoleon, iii, with, marshals, fran, ois, achille, bazaine, and, patrice, de, macmahon, in, command, of, the, field, armies, however, there, was, no, previously, arranged, plan, of, campaign, in, place, the, only, campaign, plan, prepared, between, 1866, and, 1870, was, a, defensive, one, the, german, army, comprised, that, of, the, north, german, confederation, led, by, the, kingdom, of, prussia, and, the, south, german, states, drawn, in, under, the, secret, clause, of, the, preliminary, peace, of, nikolsburg, 26, july, 1866, and, formalised, in, the, treaty, of, prague, 23, august, 1866, recruitment, and, organisation, of, the, various, armies, were, almost, identical, and, based, on, the, concept, of, conscripting, annual, classes, of, men, who, then, served, in, the, regular, regiments, for, a, fixed, term, before, being, moved, to, the, reserves, this, process, gave, a, theoretical, peace, time, strength, of, 382, 000, and, a, wartime, strength, of, about, 1, 189, 000, german, tactics, emphasised, encirclement, battles, like, cannae, and, using, artillery, offensively, whenever, possible, rather, than, advancing, in, a, column, or, line, formation, prussian, infantry, moved, in, small, groups, that, were, harder, to, target, by, artillery, or, french, defensive, fire, the, sheer, number, of, soldiers, available, made, encirclement, en, masse, and, destruction, of, french, formations, relatively, easy, the, army, was, equipped, with, the, dreyse, needle, gun, renowned, for, its, use, at, the, battle, of, k, niggr, tz, which, was, by, this, time, showing, the, age, of, its, 25, year, old, design, the, rifle, had, a, range, of, only, 600, m, 2, 000, ft, and, lacked, the, rubber, breech, seal, that, permitted, aimed, shots, the, deficiencies, of, the, needle, gun, were, more, than, compensated, for, by, the, famous, krupp, 6, pounder, 6, kg, despite, the, gun, being, called, a, 6, pounder, the, rifling, technology, enabled, guns, to, fire, twice, the, weight, of, projectiles, in, the, same, calibre, steel, breech, loading, cannons, being, issued, to, prussian, artillery, batteries, firing, a, contact, detonated, shell, the, krupp, gun, had, a, longer, range, and, a, higher, rate, of, fire, than, the, french, bronze, muzzle, loading, cannon, which, relied, on, time, fuses, the, prussian, army, was, controlled, by, the, general, staff, under, general, helmuth, von, moltke, the, prussian, army, was, unique, in, europe, for, having, the, only, such, organisation, in, existence, whose, purpose, in, peacetime, was, to, prepare, the, overall, war, strategy, and, in, wartime, to, direct, operational, movement, and, organise, logistics, and, communications, the, officers, of, the, general, staff, were, hand, picked, from, the, prussian, kriegsakademie, war, academy, moltke, embraced, new, technology, particularly, the, railroad, and, telegraph, to, coordinate, and, accelerate, mobilisation, of, large, forces, on, 28, july, 1870, napoleon, iii, left, paris, for, metz, and, assumed, command, of, the, newly, titled, army, of, the, rhine, some, 202, 448, strong, and, expected, to, grow, as, the, french, mobilization, progressed, marshal, macmahon, took, command, of, i, corps, 4, infantry, divisions, near, wissembourg, marshal, fran, ois, canrobert, brought, vi, corps, 4, infantry, divisions, to, ch, lons, sur, marne, in, northern, france, as, a, reserve, and, to, guard, against, a, prussian, advance, through, belgium, a, pre, war, plan, laid, down, by, the, late, marshal, niel, called, for, a, strong, french, offensive, from, thionville, towards, trier, and, into, the, prussian, rhineland, this, plan, was, discarded, in, favour, of, a, defensive, plan, by, generals, charles, frossard, and, bart, lemy, lebrun, which, called, for, the, army, of, the, rhine, to, remain, in, a, defensive, posture, near, the, german, border, and, repel, any, prussian, offensive, as, austria, along, with, bavaria, w, rttemberg, and, baden, were, expected, to, join, in, a, revenge, war, against, prussia, i, corps, would, invade, the, bavarian, palatinate, and, proceed, to, free, the, four, south, german, states, in, concert, with, austro, hungarian, forces, vi, corps, would, reinforce, either, army, as, needed, unfortunately, for, frossard, s, plan, the, prussian, army, mobilised, far, more, rapidly, than, expected, the, austro, hungarians, still, reeling, after, their, defeat, by, prussia, in, the, austro, prussian, war, were, treading, carefully, before, stating, that, they, would, only, side, with, france, if, the, south, germans, viewed, the, french, positively, this, did, not, materialize, as, the, four, south, german, states, had, come, to, prussia, s, aid, and, were, mobilizing, their, armies, against, france, napoleon, iii, was, under, substantial, domestic, pressure, to, launch, an, offensive, before, the, full, might, of, moltke, s, forces, was, mobilized, and, deployed, reconnaissance, by, frossard, s, forces, had, identified, only, the, prussian, 16th, infantry, division, guarding, the, border, town, of, saarbr, cken, right, before, the, entire, army, of, the, rhine, accordingly, on, 31, july, the, army, marched, forward, toward, the, saar, river, to, seize, saarbr, cken, general, frossard, s, ii, corps, and, marshal, bazaine, s, iii, corps, crossed, the, german, border, on, 2, august, and, began, to, force, the, prussian, 40th, regiment, of, the, 16th, infantry, division, from, the, town, of, saarbr, cken, with, a, series, of, direct, attacks, the, chassepot, rifle, proved, its, worth, against, the, dreyse, rifle, with, french, riflemen, regularly, outdistancing, their, prussian, counterparts, in, the, skirmishing, around, saarbr, cken, however, the, prussians, resisted, strongly, and, the, french, suffered, 86, casualties, to, the, prussian, 83, casualties, saarbr, cken, also, proved, to, be, a, major, obstacle, in, terms, of, logistics, only, one, railway, there, led, to, the, german, hinterland, but, could, be, easily, defended, by, a, single, force, and, the, only, river, systems, in, the, region, ran, along, the, border, instead, of, inland, while, the, french, hailed, the, invasion, as, the, first, step, towards, the, rhineland, and, later, berlin, general, edmond, le, b, uf, and, napoleon, iii, were, receiving, alarming, reports, from, foreign, news, sources, of, prussian, and, bavarian, armies, massing, to, the, southeast, in, addition, to, the, forces, to, the, north, and, northeast, moltke, had, indeed, massed, three, armies, in, the, area, the, prussian, first, army, with, 50, 000, men, commanded, by, general, karl, von, steinmetz, opposite, saarlouis, the, prussian, second, army, with, 134, 000, men, commanded, by, prince, friedrich, karl, opposite, the, line, forbach, spicheren, and, the, prussian, third, army, with, 120, 000, men, commanded, by, crown, prince, friedrich, wilhelm, poised, to, cross, the, border, at, wissembourg, upon, learning, from, captured, prussian, soldiers, and, a, local, area, police, chief, that, the, prussian, crown, prince, s, third, army, was, just, 30, miles, 48, km, north, from, saarbr, cken, near, the, rhine, river, town, wissembourg, general, le, b, uf, and, napoleon, iii, decided, to, retreat, to, defensive, positions, general, frossard, without, instructions, hastily, withdrew, his, elements, of, the, army, of, the, rhine, in, saarbr, cken, back, across, the, river, to, spicheren, and, forbach, marshal, macmahon, now, closest, to, wissembourg, spread, his, four, divisions, 20, miles, 32, km, to, react, to, any, prussian, bavarian, invasion, this, organization, was, due, to, a, lack, of, supplies, forcing, each, division, to, seek, out, food, and, forage, from, the, countryside, and, from, the, representatives, of, the, army, supply, arm, that, was, supposed, to, furnish, them, with, provisions, what, made, a, bad, situation, much, worse, was, the, conduct, of, general, auguste, alexandre, ducrot, commander, of, the, 1st, division, he, told, general, abel, douay, commander, of, the, 2nd, division, on, 1, august, that, the, information, i, have, received, makes, me, suppose, that, the, enemy, has, no, considerable, forces, very, near, his, advance, posts, and, has, no, desire, to, take, the, offensive, two, days, later, he, told, macmahon, that, he, had, not, found, a, single, enemy, post, it, looks, to, me, as, if, the, menace, of, the, bavarians, is, simply, bluff, even, though, ducrot, shrugged, off, the, possibility, of, an, attack, by, the, germans, macmahon, tried, to, warn, his, other, three, division, commanders, without, success, the, first, action, of, the, franco, prussian, war, took, place, on, 4, august, 1870, this, battle, saw, the, unsupported, division, of, general, douay, of, i, corps, with, some, attached, cavalry, which, was, posted, to, watch, the, border, attacked, in, overwhelming, but, uncoordinated, fashion, by, the, german, 3rd, army, during, the, day, elements, of, a, bavarian, and, two, prussian, corps, became, engaged, and, were, aided, by, prussian, artillery, which, blasted, holes, in, the, city, defenses, douay, held, a, very, strong, position, initially, thanks, to, the, accurate, long, range, rapid, fire, of, the, chassepot, rifles, but, his, force, was, too, thinly, stretched, to, hold, it, douay, was, killed, in, the, late, morning, when, a, caisson, of, the, divisional, mitrailleuse, battery, exploded, near, him, the, encirclement, of, the, town, by, the, prussians, then, threatened, the, french, avenue, of, retreat, the, fighting, within, the, town, had, become, extremely, intense, becoming, a, door, to, door, battle, of, survival, despite, an, unceasing, attack, from, prussian, infantry, the, soldiers, of, the, 2nd, division, kept, to, their, positions, the, people, of, the, town, of, wissembourg, finally, surrendered, to, the, germans, the, french, troops, who, did, not, surrender, retreated, westward, leaving, behind, 1, 000, dead, and, wounded, and, another, 1, 000, prisoners, and, all, of, their, remaining, ammunition, the, final, attack, by, the, prussian, troops, also, cost, c, 1, 000, casualties, the, german, cavalry, then, failed, to, pursue, the, french, and, lost, touch, with, them, the, attackers, had, an, initial, superiority, of, numbers, a, broad, deployment, which, made, envelopment, highly, likely, but, the, effectiveness, of, french, chassepot, rifle, fire, inflicted, costly, repulses, on, infantry, attacks, until, the, french, infantry, had, been, extensively, bombarded, by, the, prussian, artillery, the, battle, of, spicheren, on, 5, august, was, the, second, of, three, critical, french, defeats, moltke, had, originally, planned, to, keep, bazaine, s, army, on, the, saar, river, until, he, could, attack, it, with, the, 2nd, army, in, front, and, the, 1st, army, on, its, left, flank, while, the, 3rd, army, closed, towards, the, rear, the, aging, general, von, steinmetz, made, an, overzealous, unplanned, move, leading, the, 1st, army, south, from, his, position, on, the, moselle, he, moved, straight, toward, the, town, of, spicheren, cutting, off, prince, frederick, charles, from, his, forward, cavalry, units, in, the, process, on, the, french, side, planning, after, the, disaster, at, wissembourg, had, become, essential, general, le, b, uf, flushed, with, anger, was, intent, upon, going, on, the, offensive, over, the, saar, and, countering, their, loss, however, planning, for, the, next, encounter, was, more, based, upon, the, reality, of, unfolding, events, rather, than, emotion, or, pride, as, intendant, general, wolff, told, him, and, his, staff, that, supply, beyond, the, saar, would, be, impossible, therefore, the, armies, of, france, would, take, up, a, defensive, position, that, would, protect, against, every, possible, attack, point, but, also, left, the, armies, unable, to, support, each, other, while, the, french, army, under, general, macmahon, engaged, the, german, 3rd, army, at, the, battle, of, w, rth, the, german, 1st, army, under, steinmetz, finished, their, advance, west, from, saarbr, cken, a, patrol, from, the, german, 2nd, army, under, prince, friedrich, karl, of, prussia, spotted, decoy, fires, nearby, and, frossard, s, army, farther, off, on, a, distant, plateau, south, of, the, town, of, spicheren, and, took, this, as, a, sign, of, frossard, s, retreat, ignoring, moltke, s, plan, again, both, german, armies, attacked, frossard, s, french, 2nd, corps, fortified, between, spicheren, and, forbach, the, french, were, unaware, of, german, numerical, superiority, at, the, beginning, of, the, battle, as, the, german, 2nd, army, did, not, attack, all, at, once, treating, the, oncoming, attacks, as, merely, skirmishes, frossard, did, not, request, additional, support, from, other, units, by, the, time, he, realized, what, kind, of, a, force, he, was, opposing, it, was, too, late, seriously, flawed, communications, between, frossard, and, those, in, reserve, under, bazaine, slowed, down, so, much, that, by, the, time, the, reserves, received, orders, to, move, out, to, spicheren, german, soldiers, from, the, 1st, and, 2nd, armies, had, charged, up, the, heights, because, the, reserves, had, not, arrived, frossard, erroneously, believed, that, he, was, in, grave, danger, of, being, outflanked, as, german, soldiers, under, general, von, glume, were, spotted, in, forbach, instead, of, continuing, to, defend, the, heights, by, the, close, of, battle, after, dusk, he, retreated, to, the, south, the, german, casualties, were, relatively, high, due, to, the, advance, and, the, effectiveness, of, the, chassepot, rifle, they, were, quite, startled, in, the, morning, when, they, had, found, out, that, their, efforts, were, not, in, vain, frossard, had, abandoned, his, position, on, the, heights, the, battle, of, w, rth, began, when, the, two, armies, clashed, again, on, 6, august, near, w, rth, in, the, town, of, fr, schwiller, about, 10, miles, 16, km, from, wissembourg, the, crown, prince, of, prussia, s, 3rd, army, had, on, the, quick, reaction, of, his, chief, of, staff, general, von, blumenthal, drawn, reinforcements, which, brought, its, strength, up, to, 140, 000, troops, the, french, had, been, slowly, reinforced, and, their, force, numbered, only, 35, 000, although, badly, outnumbered, the, french, defended, their, position, just, outside, fr, schwiller, by, afternoon, the, germans, had, suffered, c, 10, 500, killed, or, wounded, and, the, french, had, lost, a, similar, number, of, casualties, and, another, c, 9, 200, men, taken, prisoner, a, loss, of, about, 50, the, germans, captured, fr, schwiller, which, sat, on, a, hilltop, in, the, centre, of, the, french, line, having, lost, any, hope, for, victory, and, facing, a, massacre, the, french, army, disengaged, and, retreated, in, a, westerly, direction, towards, bitche, and, saverne, hoping, to, join, french, forces, on, the, other, side, of, the, vosges, mountains, the, german, 3rd, army, did, not, pursue, the, french, but, remained, in, alsace, and, moved, slowly, south, attacking, and, destroying, the, french, garrisons, in, the, vicinity, about, 160, 000, french, soldiers, were, besieged, in, the, fortress, of, metz, following, the, defeats, on, the, frontier, a, retirement, from, metz, to, link, up, with, french, forces, at, ch, lons, was, ordered, on, 15, august, and, spotted, by, a, prussian, cavalry, patrol, under, major, oskar, von, blumenthal, next, day, a, grossly, outnumbered, prussian, force, of, 30, 000, men, of, iii, corps, of, the, 2nd, army, under, general, constantin, von, alvensleben, found, the, french, army, near, vionville, east, of, mars, la, tour, despite, odds, of, four, to, one, the, iii, corps, launched, a, risky, attack, the, french, were, routed, and, the, iii, corps, captured, vionville, blocking, any, further, escape, attempts, to, the, west, once, blocked, from, retreat, the, french, in, the, fortress, of, metz, had, no, choice, but, to, engage, in, a, fight, that, would, see, the, last, major, cavalry, engagement, in, western, europe, the, battle, soon, erupted, and, iii, corps, was, shattered, by, incessant, cavalry, charges, losing, over, half, its, soldiers, the, german, official, history, recorded, 15, 780, casualties, and, french, casualties, of, 13, 761, men, on, 16, august, the, french, had, a, chance, to, sweep, away, the, key, prussian, defense, and, to, escape, two, prussian, corps, had, attacked, the, french, advance, guard, thinking, that, it, was, the, rearguard, of, the, retreat, of, the, french, army, of, the, meuse, despite, this, misjudgment, the, two, prussian, corps, held, the, entire, french, army, for, the, whole, day, outnumbered, 5, to, 1, the, extraordinary, lan, of, the, prussians, prevailed, over, gross, indecision, by, the, french, the, french, had, lost, the, opportunity, to, win, a, decisive, victory, the, battle, of, gravelotte, or, gravelotte, st, privat, 18, august, was, the, largest, battle, in, the, franco, prussian, war, it, was, fought, about, 6, miles, 9, 7, km, west, of, metz, where, on, the, previous, day, having, intercepted, the, french, army, s, retreat, to, the, west, at, the, battle, of, mars, la, tour, the, prussians, were, now, closing, in, to, complete, the, destruction, of, the, french, forces, the, combined, german, forces, under, field, marshal, count, helmuth, von, moltke, were, the, prussian, first, and, second, armies, of, the, north, german,

high, ground, with, their, southern, left, flank, at, the, town, of, roz, rieulles, and, their, northern, right, flank, at, st, privat, on, 18, august, the, battle, began, when, at, 08, 00, moltke, ordered, the, first, and, second, armies, to, advance, against, the, french, positions, the, french, were, dug, in, with, trenches, and, rifle, pits, with, their, artillery, and, their, mitrailleuses, in, concealed, positions, backed, by, artillery, fire, steinmetz, s, vii, and, viii, corps, launched, attacks, across, the, mance, ravine, all, of, which, were, defeated, by, french, rifle, and,

took, the, town, of, roncourt, and, helped, the, guard, conquer, st, privat, while, eduard, von, fransecky, s, ii, corps, advanced, across, the, mance, ravine, the, fighting, died, down, at, 22, 00, the, next, morning, the, french, army, of, the, rhine, retreated, to, metz, where, they, were, besieged, and, forced, to, surrender, two, months, later, a, grand, total, of, 20, 163, german, troops, were, killed, wounded, or, missing, in, action, during, the, august, 18, battle, the, french, losses, were, 7, 855, killed, and, wounded, along, with, 4, 420, prisoners, of, war, half, of, them, were,

000, prussian, troops, of, the, first, and, second, armies, further, military, operations, on, the, part, of, the, army, under, bazaine, s, command, have, drawn, numerous, criticisms, from, historians, against, its, commander, it, was, later, stated, with, derogatory, irony, that, his, occupation, at, that, time, was, writing, orders, on, hygiene, and, discipline, as, well, as, playing, dominoes, bazaine, s, surprising, inactivity, was, a, great, relief, to, moltke, who, now, had, time, to, improve, his, lines, around, metz, and, intensify, the, hunt, for, macmahon, at, this, time, napoleon, iii, and, macmahon, formed, the, new, french, army, of, ch, lons, to, march, on, to, metz, to, rescue, bazaine, napoleon, iii, personally, led, the, army, with, marshal, macmahon, in, attendance, the, army, of, ch, lons, marched, northeast, towards, the, belgian, border, to, avoid, the, prussians, before, striking, south, to, link, up, with, bazaine, the, prussians, took, advantage, of, this, maneuver, to, catch, the, french, in, a, pincer, grip, moltke, left, the, prussian, first, and, second, armies, besieging, metz, except, three, corps, detached, to, form, the, army, of, the, meuse, under, the, crown, prince, of, saxony, with, this, army, and, the, prussian, third, army, moltke, marched, northward, and, caught, up, with, the, french, at, beaumont, on, 30, august, after, a, sharp, fight, in, which, they, lost, 5, 000, men, and, 40, cannons, the, french, withdrew, toward, sedan, having, reformed, in, the, town, the, army, of, ch, lons, was, immediately, isolated, by, the, converging, prussian, armies, napoleon, iii, ordered, the, army, to, break, out, of, the, encirclement, immediately, with, macmahon, wounded, on, the, previous, day, general, auguste, ducrot, took, command, of, the, french, troops, in, the, field, on, 1, september, 1870, the, battle, opened, with, the, army, of, ch, lons, with, 202, infantry, battalions, 80, cavalry, squadrons, and, 564, guns, attacking, the, surrounding, prussian, third, and, meuse, armies, totaling, 222, infantry, battalions, 186, cavalry, squadrons, and, 774, guns, general, emmanuel, f, lix, de, wimpffen, the, commander, of, the, french, v, corps, in, reserve, hoped, to, launch, a, combined, infantry, and, cavalry, attack, against, the, prussian, xi, corps, but, by, 11, 00, prussian, artillery, took, a, toll, on, the, french, while, more, prussian, troops, arrived, on, the, battlefield, the, struggle, in, the, conditions, of, encirclement, turned, out, to, be, absolutely, impossible, for, the, french, their, front, was, shot, through, with, artillery, fire, from, three, sides, the, french, cavalry, commanded, by, general, margueritte, launched, three, desperate, attacks, on, the, nearby, village, of, floing, where, the, prussian, xi, corps, was, concentrated, margueritte, was, mortally, wounded, leading, the, very, first, charge, dying, 4, days, later, and, the, two, additional, charges, led, to, nothing, but, heavy, losses, by, the, end, of, the, day, with, no, hope, of, breaking, out, napoleon, iii, called, off, the, attacks, the, french, lost, over, 17, 000, men, killed, or, wounded, with, 21, 000, captured, the, prussians, reported, their, losses, at, 2, 320, killed, 5, 980, wounded, and, 700, captured, or, missing, by, the, next, day, on, 2, september, napoleon, iii, surrendered, and, was, taken, prisoner, with, 104, 000, of, his, soldiers, it, was, an, overwhelming, victory, for, the, prussians, who, had, captured, an, entire, french, army, and, the, leader, of, france, they, subsequently, paraded, the, defeated, french, army, in, view, of, the, besieged, army, in, metz, which, had, an, impact, on, the, morale, of, the, defenders, the, defeat, of, the, french, at, sedan, had, decided, the, war, in, prussia, s, favour, one, french, army, was, now, immobilised, and, besieged, in, the, city, of, metz, and, nothing, was, preventing, a, prussian, invasion, this, defeat, was, humiliating, for, the, already, morally, defeated, french, army, and, opened, the, paveway, for, the, siege, of, paris, bazaine, a, well, known, bonapartist, at, this, time, allowed, himself, to, be, carried, away, by, illusory, plans, for, a, political, role, in, france, unconventional, military, plans, were, put, forth, by, which, the, germans, would, allow, the, army, under, bazaine, s, command, to, withdraw, from, the, fortress, of, metz, to, retreat, to, the, south, of, france, where, it, would, remain, until, the, german, armies, captured, paris, eliminated, the, political, usurpers, and, made, room, for, the, legitimate, imperial, authorities, with, the, support, of, bazaine, s, army, even, ignoring, moral, issues, and, potential, public, outcry, this, plan, seems, completely, unrealistic, bismarck, and, moltke, answered, bazaine, s, offer, of, cooperation, against, the, republican, menace, with, an, indifferent, shrug, the, german, press, undoubtedly, at, the, instigation, of, bismarck, widely, covered, this, topic, and, reported, the, details, of, bazaine, s, negotiations, the, french, press, could, only, remain, completely, silent, on, this, issue, with, whom, bazaine, negotiated, still, raises, questions, among, historians, for, a, decade, the, french, were, considered, him, m, edmond, regnier, a, sinister, figure, almost, certainly, an, agent, of, bismarck, they, would, have, been, more, justified, in, thinking, him, a, buffoon, undoubtedly, the, politically, motivated, actions, of, commander, bazaine, led, to, the, passivity, of, the, encircled, army, at, metz, and, contributed, to, the, defeat, of, not, only, this, army, but, the, country, as, a, whole, bazaine, s, army, surrendered, on, 26, october, 173, 000, people, surrendered, with, the, prussians, capturing, the, huge, amount, of, military, equipment, located, in, metz, after, the, war, marshal, bazaine, was, convicted, by, a, french, military, court, when, news, of, napoleon, iii, s, surrender, at, sedan, arrived, in, paris, the, second, empire, was, overthrown, by, a, popular, uprising, on, 4, september, jules, favre, l, on, gambetta, and, general, louis, jules, trochu, proclaimed, a, provisional, government, called, the, government, of, national, defence, and, a, third, republic, after, the, german, victory, at, sedan, most, of, the, french, standing, army, was, either, besieged, in, metz, or, held, prisoner, by, the, germans, who, hoped, for, an, armistice, and, an, end, to, the, war, bismarck, wanted, an, early, peace, but, had, difficulty, finding, a, legitimate, french, authority, with, whom, to, negotiate, the, emperor, was, a, captive, and, the, empress, in, exile, but, there, had, been, no, abdication, de, jure, and, the, army, was, still, bound, by, an, oath, of, allegiance, to, the, defunct, imperial, regime, on, the, other, hand, the, government, of, national, defence, had, no, electoral, mandate, prussia, s, intention, was, to, weaken, the, political, position, of, france, abroad, the, defensive, position, of, the, new, french, authorities, who, offered, germany, an, honorable, peace, and, reimbursement, of, the, costs, of, the, war, was, presented, by, prussia, as, aggressive, they, rejected, the, conditions, put, forward, and, demanded, the, annexation, of, the, french, provinces, of, alsace, and, part, of, lorraine, bismarck, was, dangling, the, emperor, over, the, republic, s, head, calling, napoleon, iii, the, legitimate, ruler, of, france, and, dismissing, gambetta, s, new, republic, as, no, more, than, un, coup, de, parti, a, partisan, coup, this, policy, was, to, some, extent, successful, the, european, press, discussed, the, legitimacy, of, the, french, authorities, and, prussia, s, aggressive, position, was, to, some, extent, understood, only, the, united, states, and, spain, recognized, the, government, of, national, defence, immediately, after, the, announcement, other, countries, refused, to, do, this, for, some, time, the, question, of, legitimacy, is, rather, strange, for, france, after, the, coup, d, tat, of, 1851, since, louis, napoleon, himself, only, overthrew, the, second, republic, and, rose, to, the, imperial, throne, by, means, of, a, coup, d, tat, the, germans, expected, to, negotiate, an, end, to, the, war, but, while, the, republican, government, was, amenable, to, war, reparations, or, ceding, colonial, territories, in, africa, or, southeast, asia, it, would, go, no, further, on, behalf, of, the, government, of, national, defense, favre, declared, on, 6, september, that, france, would, not, yield, an, inch, of, its, territory, nor, a, stone, of, its, fortresses, the, republic, then, renewed, the, declaration, of, war, called, for, recruits, in, all, parts, of, the, country, and, pledged, to, drive, the, german, troops, out, of, france, by, a, guerre, outrance, overwhelming, attack, the, germans, continued, the, war, yet, could, not, pin, down, any, proper, military, opposition, in, their, vicinity, as, the, bulk, of, the, remaining, french, armies, was, digging, in, near, paris, the, german, leaders, decided, to, put, pressure, upon, their, enemy, by, attacking, there, by, 15, september, german, troops, had, reached, the, outskirts, and, moltke, issued, the, orders, to, surround, the, city, on, 19, september, the, germans, surrounded, it, and, erected, a, blockade, as, already, established, at, metz, completing, the, encirclement, on, 20, september, bismarck, met, favre, on, 18, september, at, the, ch, teau, de, ferri, res, and, demanded, a, frontier, immune, to, a, french, war, of, revenge, which, included, strasbourg, alsace, and, most, of, the, moselle, department, in, lorraine, of, which, metz, was, the, capital, in, return, for, an, armistice, for, the, french, to, elect, a, national, assembly, bismarck, demanded, the, surrender, of, strasbourg, and, the, fortress, city, of, toul, to, allow, supplies, into, paris, one, of, the, perimeter, forts, had, to, be, handed, over, favre, was, unaware, that, bismarck, s, real, aim, in, making, such, extortionate, demands, was, to, establish, a, durable, peace, on, germany, s, new, western, frontier, preferably, by, a, peace, with, a, friendly, government, on, terms, acceptable, to, french, public, opinion, an, impregnable, military, frontier, was, an, inferior, alternative, to, him, favoured, only, by, the, militant, nationalists, on, the, german, side, when, the, war, had, begun, european, public, opinion, heavily, favoured, the, germans, many, italians, attempted, to, sign, up, as, volunteers, at, the, prussian, embassy, in, florence, and, a, prussian, diplomat, visited, giuseppe, garibaldi, in, caprera, bismarck, s, demand, that, france, surrender, sovereignty, over, alsace, caused, a, dramatic, shift, in, that, sentiment, in, italy, which, was, best, exemplified, by, the, reaction, of, garibaldi, soon, after, the, revolution, in, paris, who, told, the, movimento, of, genoa, on, 7, september, 1870, that, yesterday, i, said, to, you, war, to, the, death, to, bonaparte, today, i, say, to, you, rescue, the, french, republic, by, every, means, garibaldi, went, to, france, and, assumed, command, of, the, army, of, the, vosges, with, which, he, operated, around, dijon, until, the, end, of, the, war, the, energetic, actions, of, a, part, of, the, government, delegation, in, tours, under, gambetta, s, leadership, led, to, significant, success, in, the, formation, of, a, new, army, in, less, than, four, months, with, persistent, battles, at, the, front, eleven, new, corps, were, formed, nos, xvi, xxvi, the, average, success, of, the, formation, was, equal, to, six, thousand, infantrymen, and, two, batteries, per, day, this, success, was, achieved, despite, the, fact, that, the, military, industry, and, warehouses, were, concentrated, mainly, in, paris, all, supplies, in, the, province, chiefs, weapons, camps, uniforms, ammunition, equipment, baggage, had, to, be, improvised, anew, many, branches, of, the, military, industry, were, re, established, in, the, province, freedom, of, communication, with, foreign, markets, brought, significant, benefits, it, was, possible, to, make, large, purchases, on, foreign, markets, mainly, english, belgian, and, american, the, artillery, created, by, gambetta, in, four, months, 238, batteries, was, one, and, a, half, times, larger, than, the, artillery, of, imperial, france, in, the, end, eight, corps, participated, in, the, battles, and, three, were, ready, only, by, the, end, of, january, when, a, truce, was, already, concluded, while, the, germans, had, a, 2, 1, numerical, advantage, before, napoleon, iii, s, surrender, this, french, recruitment, gave, them, a, 2, 1, or, 3, 1, advantage, the, french, more, than, tripled, their, forces, during, the, war, while, the, germans, did, not, increase, theirs, as, much, the, number, of, 888, 000, mobilized, by, the, north, german, union, in, august, increased, by, only, 2, after, 3, 1, 2, months, and, by, the, end, of, the, war, six, months, later, only, by, 15, which, did, not, even, balance, the, losses, incurred, prussia, was, completely, unaware, of, the, feverish, activity, of, permanent, mobilization, this, disparity, in, forces, created, a, crisis, for, the, germans, at, the, front, in, november, 1870, which, only, the, release, of, the, large, forces, besieging, the, fortress, of, metz, allowed, them, to, overcome, prussian, forces, commenced, the, siege, of, paris, on, 19, september, 1870, faced, with, the, blockade, the, new, french, government, called, for, the, establishment, of, several, large, armies, in, the, french, provinces, these, new, bodies, of, troops, were, to, march, towards, paris, and, attack, the, germans, there, from, various, directions, at, the, same, time, armed, french, civilians, were, to, create, a, guerilla, force, the, so, called, francs, tireurs, for, the, purpose, of, attacking, german, supply, lines, bismarck, was, an, active, supporter, of, the, bombardment, of, the, city, he, sought, to, end, the, war, as, soon, as, possible, very, much, fearing, a, change, in, the, international, situation, unfavorable, to, prussia, as, he, himself, called, it, the, intervention, of, neutrals, therefore, bismarck, constantly, and, actively, insisted, on, the, early, start, of, the, bombardment, despite, all, the, objections, of, the, military, command, von, blumenthal, who, commanded, the, siege, was, opposed, to, the, bombardment, on, moral, grounds, in, this, he, was, backed, by, other, senior, military, figures, such, as, the, crown, prince, and,

for, the, poor, from, cold, and, hunger, dispatched, from, paris, as, the, republican, government, emissary, l, on, gambetta, flew, over, the, german, lines, in, a, balloon, inflated, with, coal, gas,

their, support, of, the, new, regime, within, a, few, weeks, five, new, armies, totalling, more, than, 500, 000, troops, were, recruited, the, germans, dispatched, some, of, their, troops, to, the, french, provinces, to, detect, attack, and, disperse, the, new, french, armies, before, they, could, become, a, menace, the, germans, were, not, prepared, for, an, occupation, of, the, whole, of, france, on, 10, october, hostilities, began, between, german, and, french, republican, forces, near, orl, ans, at, first, the, germans, were, victorious, but, the, french, drew, reinforcements, and, defeated, a, bavarian, force, at, the, battle, of, coulmiers, on, 9, november, after, the, surrender, of, metz, more, than, 100, 000, well, trained, and, experienced, german, troops, joined, the, german, southern, army, the, french, were, forced, to, abandon, orl, ans, on, 4, december, and, were, finally, defeated, at, the, battle, of, le, mans, 10, 12, january, a, second, french, army, which, operated, north, of, paris, was, turned, back, at, the, battle, of, amiens, 27, november, the, battle, of, bapaume, 3, january, 1871, and, the, battle, of, st, quentin, 13, january, following, the, army, of, the, loire, s, defeats, gambetta, turned, to, general, faidherbe, s, army, of, the, north, the, army, had, achieved, several, small, victories, at, towns, such, as, ham, la, hallue, and, amiens, and, was, protected, by, the, belt, of, fortresses, in, northern, france, allowing, faidherbe, s, men, to, launch, quick, attacks, against, isolated, prussian, units, then, retreat, behind, the, fortresses, despite, access, to, the, armaments, factories, of, lille, the, army, of, the, north, suffered, from, severe, supply, difficulties, which, depressed, morale, in, january, 1871, gambetta, forced, faidherbe, to, march, his, army, beyond, the, fortresses, and, engage, the, prussians, in, open, battle, the, army, was, severely, weakened, by, low, morale, supply, problems, the, terrible, winter, weather, and, low, troop, quality, whilst, general, faidherbe, was, unable, to, command, due, to, his, poor, health, the, result, of, decades, of, campaigning, in, west, africa, at, the, battle, of, st, quentin, the, army, of, the, north, suffered, a, crushing, defeat, and, was, scattered, releasing, thousands, of, prussian, soldiers, to, be, relocated, to, the, east, following, the, destruction, of, the, french, army, of, the, loire, remnants, of, the, loire, army, gathered, in, eastern, france, to, form, the, army, of, the, east, commanded, by, general, charles, denis, bourbaki, in, a, final, attempt, to, cut, the, german, supply, lines, in, northeast, france, bourbaki, s, army, marched, north, to, attack, the, prussian, siege, of, belfort, and, relieve, the, defenders, the, french, troops, had, a, significant, advantage, 110, thousand, soldiers, against, 40, thousand, the, french, offensive, took, the, germans, by, surprise, and, by, mid, january, 1871, the, french, had, reached, the, lisaine, river, just, a, few, kilometers, from, the, besieged, fortress, of, belfort, in, the, battle, of, the, lisaine, bourbaki, s, men, failed, to, break, through, german, lines, commanded, by, general, august, von, werder, bringing, in, the, german, southern, army, general, von, manteuffel, then, drove, bourbaki, s, army, into, the, mountains, near, the, swiss, border, bourbaki, attempted, to, commit, suicide, but, failed, to, inflict, a, fatal, wound, facing, annihilation, the, last, intact, french, army, of, 87, 000, men, now, commanded, by, general, justin, clinchant, crossed, the, border, and, was, disarmed, and, interned, by, the, neutral, swiss, near, pontarlier, 1, february, the, besieged, fortress, of, belfort, continued, to, resist, until, the, signing, of, the, armistice, repelling, a, german, attempt, to, capture, the, fortress, on, 27, january, which, was, some, consolation, for, the, french, in, this, stubborn, and, unhappy, campaign, on, 26, january, 1871, the, government, of, national, defence, based, in, paris, negotiated, an, armistice, with, the, prussians, with, paris, starving, and, gambetta, s, provincial, armies, reeling, from, one, disaster, after, another, french, foreign, minister, favre, went, to, versailles, on, 24, january, to, discuss, peace, terms, with, bismarck, bismarck, agreed, to, end, the, siege, and, allow, food, convoys, to, immediately, enter, paris, including, trains, carrying, millions, of, german, army, rations, on, condition, that, the, government, of, national, defence, surrender, several, key, fortresses, outside, paris, to, the, prussians, without, the, forts, the, french, army, would, no, longer, be, able, to, defend, paris, although, public, opinion, in, paris, was, strongly, against, any, form, of, surrender, or, concession, to, the, prussians, the, government, realised, that, it, could, not, hold, the, city, for, much, longer, and, that, gambetta, s, provincial, armies, would, probably, never, break, through, to, relieve, paris, president, trochu, resigned, on, 25, january, and, was, replaced, by, favre, who, signed, the, surrender, two, days, later, at, versailles, with, the, armistice, coming, into, effect, at, midnight, on, 28, january, a, truce, was, concluded, for, 21, days, after, the, exhaustion, of, food, and, fuel, supplies, the, paris, garrison, capitulated, the, national, guard, retained, its, weapons, while, german, troops, occupied, part, of, the, forts, of, paris, to, prevent, the, possibility, of, resuming, hostilities, but, military, operations, continued, in, the, eastern, part, of, the, country, in, the, area, of, operation, of, the, bourbaki, army, the, french, side, having, no, reliable, information, about, the, outcome, of, the, struggle, insisted, on, excluding, this, area, from, the, truce, in, the, hope, of, a, successful, outcome, of, the, struggle, the, germans, did, not, dissuade, the, french, several, sources, claim, that, in, his, carriage, on, the, way, back, to, paris, favre, broke, into, tears, and, collapsed, into, his, daughter, s, arms, as, the, guns, around, paris, fell, silent, at, midnight, at, bordeaux, gambetta, received, word, from, paris, on, 29, january, that, the, government, had, surrendered, furious, he, refused, to, surrender, jules, simon, a, member, of, the, government, arrived, from, paris, by, train, on, 1, february, to, negotiate, with, gambetta, another, group, of, three, ministers, arrived, in, bordeaux, on, 5, february, and, the, following, day, gambetta, stepped, down, and, surrendered, control, of, the, provincial, armies, to, the, government, of, national, defence, which, promptly, ordered, a, cease, fire, across, france, when, the, war, began, the, french, government, ordered, a, blockade, of, the, north, german, coasts, which, the, small, north, german, federal, navy, with, only, five, ironclads, and, various, minor, vessels, could, do, little, to, oppose, for, most, of, the, war, the, three, largest, german, ironclads, were, out, of, service, with, engine, troubles, only, the, turret, ship, sms, arminius, was, available, to, conduct, operations, by, the, time, engine, repairs, had, been, completed, the, french, fleet, had, already, departed, the, blockade, proved, only, partially, successful, due, to, crucial, oversights, by, the, planners, in, paris, reservists, that, were, supposed, to, be, at, the, ready, in, case, of, war, were, working, in, the, newfoundland, fisheries, or, in, scotland, only, part, of, the, 470, ship, french, navy, put, to, sea, on, 24, july, before, long, the, french, navy, ran, short, of, coal, needing, 200, short, tons, 180, t, per, day, and, having, a, bunker, capacity, in, the, fleet, of, only, 250, short, tons, 230, t, a, blockade, of, wilhelmshaven, failed, and, conflicting, orders, about, operations, in, the, baltic, sea, or, a, return, to, france, made, the, french, naval, efforts, futile, spotting, a, blockade, runner, became, unwelcome, because, of, the, question, du, charbon, pursuit, of, prussian, ships, quickly, depleted, the, coal, reserves, of, the, french, ships, but, the, main, reason, for, the, only, partial, success, of, the, naval, operation, was, the, fear, of, the, french, command, to, risk, political, complications, with, great, britain, this, deterred, the, french, command, from, trying, to, interrupt, german, trade, under, the, british, flag, despite, the, limited, measures, of, the, blockade, it, still, created, noticeable, difficulties, for, german, trade, the, actual, captures, of, german, ships, were, eighty, in, number, to, relieve, pressure, from, the, expected, german, attack, into, alsace, lorraine, napoleon, iii, and, the, french, high, command, planned, a, seaborne, invasion, of, northern, germany, as, soon, as, war, began, the, french, expected, the, invasion, to, divert, german, troops, and, to, encourage, denmark, to, join, in, the, war, with, its, 50, 000, strong, army, and, the, royal, danish, navy, they, discovered, that, prussia, had, recently, built, defences, around, the, big, north, german, ports, including, coastal, artillery, batteries, with, krupp, heavy, artillery, which, with, a, range, of, 4, 000, yards, 3, 700, m, had, double, the, range, of, french, naval, guns, the, french, navy, lacked, the, heavy, guns, to, engage, the, coastal, defences, and, the, topography, of, the, prussian, coast, made, a, seaborne, invasion, of, northern, germany, impossible, the, french, marines, intended, for, the, invasion, of, northern, germany, were, dispatched, to, reinforce, the, french, army, of, ch, lons, and, fell, into, captivity, at, sedan, along, with, napoleon, iii, a, shortage, of, officers, following, the, capture, of, most, of, the, professional, french, army, at, the, siege, of, metz, and, at, the, battle, of, sedan, led, to, naval, officers, being, sent, from, their, ships, to, command, hastily, assembled, reservists, of, the, garde, mobile, as, the, autumn, storms, of, the, north, sea, forced, the, return, of, more, of, the, french, ships, the, blockade, of, the, north, german, ports, diminished, and, in, september, 1870, the, french, navy, abandoned, the, blockade, for, the, winter, the, rest, of, the, navy, retired, to, ports, along, the, english, channel, and, remained, in, port, for, the, rest, of, the, war, outside, europe, the, french, corvette, dupleix, blockaded, the, german, corvette, sms, hertha, in, nagasaki, and, the, battle, of, havana, took, place, between, the, prussian, gunboat, sms, meteor, and, the, french, aviso, bouvet, off, havana, cuba, in, november, 1870, the, franco, prussian, war, of, 1870, 71, resulted, in, numerous, war, crimes, committed, by, the, prussian, army, one, notable, war, crime, committed, during, the, conflict, was, the, execution, of, prisoners, of, war, reports, indicate, that, several, hundred, french, prisoners, were, summarily, executed, by, prussian, soldiers, this, included, the, execution, of, a, group, of, over, 200, french, soldiers, at, the, village, of, dornach, which, was, subsequently, referred, to, as, the, dornach, atrocities, in, the, small, town, of, bazeilles, near, sedan, french, marines, and, partisans, put, up, a, resistance, against, a, force, of, bavarian, soldiers, after, the, initial, french, resistance, was, overcome, the, bavarian, troops, shelled, the, village, with, artillery, before, sending, in, infantry, to, continue, the, assault, in, battle, some, surrendering, soldiers, were, shot, on, the, spot, and, over, 400, buildings, were, destroyed, the, bavarian, troops, detained, around, one, hundred, civilians, believing, they, illegally, took, part, in, the, battle, only, to, release, them, unharmed, the, next, day, after, the, war, investigations, established, that, only, 39, civilians, were, killed, or, wounded, during, the, battle, prussian, soldiers, were, also, accused, of, committing, acts, of, violence, against, civilians, including, murder, rape, and, the, destruction, of, property, the, quick, german, victory, over, the, french, stunned, neutral, observers, many, of, whom, had, expected, a, french, victory, and, a, long, war, the, strategic, advantages, which, the, germans, had, were, not, appreciated, outside, germany, until, after, hostilities, had, ceased, other, countries, quickly, discerned, the, advantages, given, to, the, germans, by, their, military, system, and, adopted, many, of, their, innovations, particularly, the, general, staff, universal, conscription, and, highly, detailed, mobilization, systems, the, prussian, general, staff, developed, by, moltke, proved, to, be, extremely, effective, in, contrast, to, the, traditional, french, school, this, was, in, large, part, because, the, prussian, general, staff, was, created, to, study, previous, prussian, operations, and, learn, to, avoid, mistakes, the, structure, also, greatly, strengthened, moltke, s, ability, to, control, large, formations, spread, out, over, significant, distances, the, chief, of, the, general, staff, effectively, the, commander, in, chief, of, the, prussian, army, was, independent, of, the, minister, of, war, and, answered, only, to, the, monarch, the, french, general, staff, along, with, those, of, every, other, european, military, was, little, better, than, a, collection, of, assistants, for, the, line, commanders, this, disorganization, hampered, the, french, commanders, ability, to, exercise, control, of, their, forces, in, addition, the, prussian, military, education, system, was, superior, to, the, french, model, prussian, staff, officers, were, trained, to, exhibit, initiative, and, independent, thinking, indeed, this, was, moltke, s, expectation, the, french, meanwhile, suffered, from, an, education, and, promotion, system, that, stifled, intellectual, development, according, to, the, military, historian, dallas, irvine, the, system, was, almost, completely, effective, in, excluding, the, army, s, brain, power, from, the, staff, and, high, command, to, the, resulting, lack, of, intelligence, at, the, top, can, be, ascribed, all, the, inexcusable, defects, of, french, military, policy, albrecht, von, roon, the, prussian, minister, of, war, from, 1859, to, 1873, put, into, effect, a, series, of, reforms, of, the, prussian, military, system, in, the, 1860s, among, these, were, two, major, reforms, that, substantially, increased, the, military, power, of, germany, the, first, was, a, reorganization, of, the, army, that, integrated, the, regular, army, and, the, landwehr, reserves, the, second, was, the, provision, for, the, conscription, of, every, male, prussian, of, military, age, in, the, event, of, mobilization, thus, although, the, population, of, france, was, greater, than, the, population, of, all, of, the, northern, german, states, that, participated, in, the, war, the, germans, mobilized, more, soldiers, for, battle, at, the, start, of, the, franco, prussian, war, 462, 000, german, soldiers, concentrated, on, the, french, frontier, while, only, 270, 000, french, soldiers, could, be, moved, to, face, them, the, french, army, having, lost, 100, 000, stragglers, before, a, shot, was, fired, through, poor, planning, and, administration, this, was, partly, due, to, the, peacetime, organisations, of, the, armies, each, prussian, corps, was, based, within, a, kreis, literally, circle, around, the, chief, city, in, an, area, reservists, rarely, lived, more, than, a, day, s, travel, from, their, regiment, s, depot, by, contrast, french, regiments, generally, served, far, from, their, depots, which, in, turn, were, not, in, the, areas, of, france, from, which, their, soldiers, were, drawn, reservists, often, faced, several, days, journey, to, report, to, their, depots, and, then, another, long, journey, to, join, their, regiments, large, numbers, of, reservists, choked, railway, stations, vainly, seeking, rations, and, orders, the, effect, of, these, differences, was, accentuated, by, the, peacetime, preparations, the, prussian, general, staff, had, drawn, up, minutely, detailed, mobilization, plans, using, the, railway, system, which, in, turn, had, been, partly, laid, out, in, response, to, recommendations, of, a, railway, section, within, the, general, staff, the, french, railway, system, with, competing, companies, had, developed, purely, from, commercial, pressures, and, many, journeys, to, the, front, in, alsace, and, lorraine, involved, long, diversions, and, frequent, changes, between, trains, there, was, no, system, of, military, control, of, the, railways, and, officers, simply, commandeered, trains, as, they, saw, fit, rail, sidings, and, marshalling, yards, became, choked, with, loaded, wagons, with, nobody, responsible, for, unloading, them, or, directing, them, to, the, destination, france, also, suffered, from, an, outdated, tactical, system, although, referred, to, as, napoleonic, tactics, this, system, was, developed, by, antoine, henri, jomini, during, his, time, in, russia, surrounded, by, a, rigid, aristocracy, with, a, sacred, social, order, mentality, jomini, s, system, was, equally, rigid, and, inflexible, his, system, simplified, several, formations, that, were, meant, for, an, entire, army, using, battalions, as, the, building, blocks, his, system, was, simple, but, only, strong, enough, to, attack, in, one, direction, the, system, was, adopted, by, the, bourbons, to, prevent, a, repeat, of, when, napoleon, i, had, returned, to, france, and, napoleon, iii, retained, the, system, upon, his, ascension, to, power, hence, why, they, became, associated, with, his, family, name, the, prussians, in, contrast, did, not, use, battalions, as, their, basic, tactical, unit, and, their, system, was, much, more, flexible, companies, were, formed, into, columns, and, attacked, in, parallel, rather, than, as, a, homogeneous, battalion, sized, block, attacking, in, parallel, allowed, each, company, to, choose, its, own, axis, of, advance, and, make, the, most, of, local, cover, it, also, permitted, the, prussians, to, fire, at, oblique, angles, raking, the, french, lines, with, rifle, fire, thus, even, though, the, prussians, had, inferior, rifles, they, still, inflicted, more, casualties, with, rifle, fire, than, the, french, with, 53, 900, french, killed, by, the, dreyse, 70, of, their, war, casualties, versus, 25, 475, germans, killed, by, the, chassepot, 96, of, their, war, casualties, although, austria, hungary, and, denmark, had, both, wished, to, avenge, their, recent, military, defeats, against, prussia, they, chose, not, to, intervene, in, the, war, due, to, a, lack, of, confidence, in, the, french, these, countries, did, not, have, a, documented, alliance, with, france, and, they, were, too, late, to, start, a, war, after, the, rapid, and, stunning, victories, of, prussia, they, preferred, to, abandon, any, plans, to, intervene, in, the, war, altogether, napoleon, iii, also, failed, to, cultivate, alliances, with, the, russian, empire, and, the, united, kingdom, partially, due, to, the, diplomatic, efforts, of, the, prussian, chancellor, otto, von, bismarck, bismarck, had, bought, tsar, alexander, ii, s, complicity, by, promising, to, help, restore, his, naval, access, to, the, black, sea, and, mediterranean, cut, off, by, the, treaties, ending, the, crimean, war, other, powers, were, less, biddable, seizing, upon, the, distraction, of, the, franco, prussian, war, russia, in, november, 1870, had, begun, rebuilding, its, naval, bases, in, the, black, sea, a, clear, violation, of, the, treaty, that, had, ended, the, crimean, war, fourteen, years, earlier, after, the, peace, of, frankfurt, in, 1871, a, rapprochement, between, france, and, russia, was, born, instead, of, forging, ties, with, russia, in, the, east, and, further, crippling, france, in, the, west, bismarck, s, miscalculation, had, opened, the, door, to, future, relations, between, paris, and, st, petersburg, the, culmination, of, this, new, relationship, will, finally, be, the, franco, russian, alliance, of, 1894, an, alliance, that, explicitly, refers, to, the, perceived, threat, of, germany, and, its, military, response, great, britain, saw, nothing, wrong, with, the, strengthening, of, prussia, on, the, european, continent, viewing, france, as, its, traditional, rival, in, international, affairs, lord, palmerston, the, head, of, the, british, cabinet, in, 1865, wrote, the, current, prussia, is, too, weak, to, be, honest, and, independent, in, its, actions, and, taking, into, account, the, interests, of, the, future, it, is, highly, desirable, for, germany, as, a, whole, became, strong, so, she, was, able, to, keep, the, ambitious, and, warlike, nation, france, and, russia, which, compress, it, from, the, west, and, the, east, english, historians, criticize, the, then, british, policy, pointing, out, that, palmerston, misunderstood, bismarck, s, policy, due, to, his, adherence, to, outdated, ideas, over, time, britain, began, to, understand, that, the, military, defeat, of, france, meant, a, radical, change, in, the, european, balance, of, power, in, the, future, the, development, of, historical, events, is, characterized, by, a, gradual, increase, in, anglo, german, contradictions, the, colonial, quarrels, naval, rivalry, and, disagreement, over, the, european, balance, of, power, which, drove, britain, and, germany, apart, were, in, effect, the, strategical, and, geopolitical, manifestations, of, the, relative, shift, in, the, economic, power, of, these, two, countries, between, 1860, and, 1914, after, the, peace, of, prague, in, 1866, the, nominally, independent, german, states, of, saxony, bavaria, w, rttemberg, baden, and, hesse, darmstadt, the, southern, part, that, was, not, included, in, the, north, german, union, remained, despite, the, fact, that, there, was, a, strong, opposition, to, prussia, in, the, ruling, circles, and, in, the, war, of, 1866, they, participated, on, the, side, of, austria, against, prussia, they, were, forced, to, reckon, with, a, broad, popular, movement, in, favor, of, german, unity, and, were, also, afraid, of, angering, their, strong, neighbor, in, the, form, of, prussia, after, the, diplomatic, provocation, in, bad, ems, these, states, had, no, room, for, maneuver, the, war, was, presented, by, bismarck, as, a, war, for, national, independence, against, an, external, enemy, all, these, states, joined, the, prussian, war, from, the, very, beginning, of, hostilities, in, january, 1871, these, states, became, part, of, the, german, empire, the, french, breech, loading, rifle, the, chassepot, had, a, longer, range, than, the, german, needle, gun, 1, 400, metres, 1, 500, yd, compared, to, 550, m, 600, yd, the, french, also, had, an, early, machine, gun, type, weapon, the, mitrailleuse, which, could, fire, its, thirty, seven, barrels, at, a, range, of, around, 1, 100, m, 1, 200, yd, it, was, developed, in, such, secrecy, that, little, training, with, the, weapon, had, occurred, leaving, french, gunners, with, little, experience, the, gun, was, treated, like, artillery, and, in, this, role, it, was, ineffective, worse, still, once, the, small, number, of, soldiers, who, had, been, trained, how, to, use, the, new, weapon, became, casualties, there, were, no, replacements, who, knew, how, to, operate, the, mitrailleuse, the, french, were, equipped, with, bronze, rifled, muzzle, loading, artillery, while, the, prussians, used, new, steel, breech, loading, guns, which, had, a, far, longer, range, and, a, faster, rate, of, fire, prussian, gunners, strove, for, a, high, rate, of, fire, which, was, discouraged, in, the, french, army, in, the, belief, that, it, wasted, ammunition, in, addition, the, prussian, artillery, batteries, had, 30, more, guns, than, their, french, counterparts, the, prussian, guns, typically, opened, fire, at, a, range, of, 2, 3, kilometres, 1, 2, 1, 9, mi, beyond, the, range, of, french, artillery, or, the, chassepot, rifle, the, prussian, batteries, could, thus, destroy, french, artillery, with, impunity, before, being, moved, forward, to, directly, support, infantry, attacks, the, germans, fired, 30, 000, 000, rounds, of, small, arms, ammunition, and, 362, 662, field, artillery, rounds, the, events, of, the, franco, prussian, war, had, great, influence, on, military, thinking, over, the, next, forty, years, lessons, drawn, from, the, war, included, the, need, for, a, general, staff, system, the, scale, and, duration, of, future, wars, and, the, tactical, use, of, artillery, and, cavalry, the, bold, use, of, artillery, by, the, prussians, to, silence, french, guns, at, long, range, and, then, to, directly, support, infantry, attacks, at, close, range, proved, to, be, superior, to, the, defensive, doctrine, employed, by, french, gunners, likewise, the, war, showed, that, breech, loading, cannons, were, superior, to, muzzle, loaded, cannons, just, as, the, austro, prussian, war, of, 1866, had, demonstrated, for, rifles, the, prussian, tactics, and, designs, were, adopted, by, european, armies, by, 1914, exemplified, in, the, french, 75, an, artillery, piece, optimised, to, provide, direct, fire, support, to, advancing, infantry, most, european, armies, ignored, the, evidence, of, the, russo, japanese, war, of, 1904, 1905, which, suggested, that, infantry, armed, with, new, smokeless, powder, rifles, could, engage, gun, crews, effectively, in, the, open, this, forced, gunners, to, fire, at, longer, range, using, indirect, fire, usually, from, a, position, of, cover, the, heavy, use, of, fortifications, and, dugouts, in, the, russo, japanese, war, also, greatly, undermined, the, usefulness, of, field, artillery, which, was, not, designed, for, indirect, fire, at, the, battle, of, mars, la, tour, the, prussian, 12th, cavalry, brigade, commanded, by, general, adalbert, von, bredow, conducted, a, charge, against, a, french, artillery, battery, the, attack, was, a, costly, success, and, came, to, be, known, as, von, bredow, s, death, ride, but, which, nevertheless, was, held, to, prove, that, cavalry, charges, could, still, prevail, on, the, battlefield, use, of, traditional, cavalry, on, the, battlefields, of, 1914, proved, to, be, disastrous, due, to, accurate, long, range, rifle, fire, machine, guns, and, artillery, bredow, s, attack, had, succeeded, only, because, of, an, unusually, effective, artillery, bombardment, just, before, the, charge, along, with, favorable, terrain, that, masked, his, approach, a, third, influence, was, the, effect, on, notions, of, entrenchment, and, its, limitations, while, the, american, civil, war, had, famously, involved, entrenchment, in, the, final, years, of, the, war, the, prussian, system, had, overwhelmed, french, attempts, to, use, similar, tactics, with, prussian, tactics, seeming, to, make, entrenchment, and, prolonged, offensive, campaigns, ineffective, the, experience, of, the, american, civil, war, was, seen, as, that, of, a, musket, war, not, a, rifle, war, many, european, armies, were, convinced, of, the, viability, of, the, cult, of, the, offensive, because, of, this, and, focused, their, attention, on, aggressive, bayonet, charges, over, infantry, fire, these, would, needlessly, expose, men, to, artillery, fire, in, 1914, and, entrenchment, would, return, with, a, vengeance, the, germans, deployed, a, total, of, 33, 101, officers, and, 1, 113, 254, men, into, france, of, whom, they, lost, 1, 046, officers, and, 16, 539, enlisted, men, killed, in, action, another, 671, officers, and, 10, 050, men, died, of, their, wounds, for, total, battle, deaths, of, 28,

among, the, missing, and, captured, were, 103, officers, and, 10, 026, men, the, wounded, amounted, to, 3, 725, officers, and, 86, 007, men, french, battle, deaths, were, 77, 000, of, which, 41, 000, were, killed, in, action, and, 36, 000, died, of, wounds, more, than, 45, 000, died, of, sickness, total, deaths, were, 138, 871, with, 136, 540, being, suffered, by, the, army, and, 2, 331, by, the, navy, the, wounded, totaled, 137, 626, 131, 000, for, the, army, and, 6, 526, for, the, navy, french, prisoners, of, war, numbered, 383, 860, in, addition, 90, 192, french, soldiers, were, interned, in, switzerland, and, 6, 300, in, belgium, during, the, war, the, international, committee, of, the, red, cross, icrc, established, an, international, tracing, agency, in, basel, for, prisoners, of, that, war, the, holdings, of, the, basel, agency, were, later, transferred, to, the, icrc, headquarters, in, geneva, and, integrated, into, the, icrc, archives, where, they, are, accessible, today, the, prussian, army, under, the, terms, of, the, armistice, held, a, brief, victory, parade, in, paris, on, 1, march, the, city, was, silent, and, draped, with, black, and, the, germans, quickly, withdrew, bismarck, honoured, the, armistice, by, allowing, train, loads, of, food, into, paris, and, withdrawing, prussian, forces, to, the, east, of, the, city, prior, to, a, full, withdrawal, once, france, agreed, to, pay, a, five, billion, franc, war, indemnity, the, indemnity, was, proportioned, according, to, population, to, be, the, exact, equivalent, to, the, indemnity, imposed, by, napoleon, on, prussia, in, 1807, at, the, same, time, prussian, forces, were, concentrated, in, the, provinces, of, alsace, and, lorraine, an, exodus, occurred, from, paris, as, some, 200, 000, people, predominantly, middle, class, went, to, the, countryside, during, the, war, the, paris, national, guard, particularly, in, the, working, class, neighbourhoods, of, paris, had, become, highly, politicised, and, units, elected, officers, many, refused, to, wear, uniforms, or, obey, commands, from, the, national, government, national, guard, units, tried, to, seize, power, in, paris, on, 31, october, 1870, and, 22, january, 1871, on, 18, march, 1871, when, the, regular, army, tried, to, remove, cannons, from, an, artillery, park, on, montmartre, national, guard, units, resisted, and, killed, two, army, generals, the, national, government, and, regular, army, forces, retreated, to, versailles, and, a, revolutionary, government, was, proclaimed, in, paris, a, commune, was, elected, which, was, dominated, by, socialists, anarchists, and, revolutionaries, the, red, flag, replaced, the, french, tricolour, and, a, civil, war, began, between, the, commune, and, the, regular, army, which, attacked, and, recaptured, paris, from, 21, 28, may, in, the, semaine, sanglante, bloody, week, during, the, fighting, the, communards, killed, around, 500, people, including, georges, darboy, the, archbishop, of, paris, and, burned, down, many, government, buildings, including, the, tuileries, palace, and, the, hotel, de, ville, communards, captured, with, weapons, were, routinely, shot, by, the, army, and, government, troops, killed, between, 7, 000, and, 30, 000, communards, both, during, the, fighting, and, in, massacres, of, men, women, and, children, during, and, after, the, commune, more, recent, histories, based, on, studies, of, the, number, buried, in, paris, cemeteries, and, in, mass, graves, after, the, fall, of, the, commune, put, the, number, killed, at, between, 6, 000, and, 10, 000, twenty, six, courts, were, established, to, try, more, than, 40, 000, people, who, had, been, arrested, which, took, until, 1875, and, imposed, 95, death, sentences, of, which, 23, were, inflicted, forced, labour, for, life, was, imposed, on, 251, people, 1, 160, people, were, transported, to, a, fortified, place, and, 3, 417, people, were, transported, about, 20, 000, communards, were, held, in, prison, hulks, until, released, in, 1872, and, a, great, many, communards, fled, abroad, to, britain, switzerland, belgium, or, the, united, states, the, survivors, were, amnestied, by, a, bill, introduced, by, gambetta, in, 1880, and, allowed, to, return, in, 1830, the, french, army, invaded, and, conquered, the, beylik, of, algiers, afterwards, france, colonized, the, country, setting, up, its, own, administration, over, algeria, the, withdrawal, of, a, large, proportion, of, the, army, stationed, in, french, algeria, to, serve, in, the, franco, prussian, war, had, weakened, france, s, control, of, the, territory, while, reports, of, defeats, undermined, french, prestige, amongst, the, indigenous, population, the, most, serious, native, insurrection, since, the, time, of, emir, abdelkader, was, the, 1871, mokrani, revolt, in, the, kabylia, which, spread, through, much, of, algeria, by, april, 1871, 250, tribes, had, risen, or, nearly, a, third, of, algeria, s, population, the, creation, of, a, unified, german, empire, which, excluded, austria, greatly, disturbed, the, balance, of, power, that, had, been, created, with, the, congress, of, vienna, after, the, end, of, the, napoleonic, wars, germany, had, established, itself, as, a, major, power, in, continental, europe, boasting, one, of, the, most, powerful, and, professional, armies, in, the, world, although, britain, remained, the, dominant, world, power, overall, british, involvement, in, european, affairs, during, the, late, 19th, century, was, limited, owing, to, its, focus, on, colonial, empire, building, allowing, germany, to, exercise, great, influence, over, the, european, mainland, anglo, german, straining, of, tensions, was, somewhat, mitigated, by, several, prominent, relationships, between, the, two, powers, such, as, the, crown, prince, s, marriage, with, the, daughter, of, queen, victoria, einheit, unity, was, achieved, at, the, expense, of, freiheit, freedom, according, to, karl, marx, the, german, empire, became, a, military, despotism, cloaked, in, parliamentary, forms, with, a, feudal, ingredient, influenced, by, the, bourgeoisie, festooned, with, bureaucrats, and, guarded, by, police, likewise, many, historians, would, see, germany, s, escape, into, war, in, 1914, as, a, flight, from, all, of, the, internal, political, contradictions, forged, by, bismarck, at, versailles, in, the, fall, of, 1870, the, defeat, in, the, franco, prussian, war, led, to, the, birth, of, revanchism, literally, revenge, ism, in, france, characterised, by, a, deep, sense, of, bitterness, hatred, and, demand, for, revenge, against, germany, this, was, particularly, manifested, in, loose, talk, of, another, war, with, germany, in, order, to, reclaim, alsace, and, lorraine, it, also, led, to, the, development, of, nationalist, ideologies, emphasising, the, ideal, of, the, guarded, self, referential, nation, schooled, in, the, imperative, of, war, an, ideology, epitomised, by, figures, such, as, general, georges, ernest, boulanger, in, the, 1880s, paintings, that, emphasized, the, humiliation, of, the, defeat, became, in, high, demand, such, as, those, by, alphonse, de, neuville, revanchism, was, not, a, major, cause, of, war, in, 1914, because, it, faded, after, 1880, j, f, v, keiger, says, by, the, 1880s, franco, german, relations, were, relatively, good, the, french, public, had, very, little, interest, in, foreign, affairs, and, elite, french, opinion, was, strongly, opposed, to, war, with, its, more, powerful, neighbor, the, elites, were, now, calm, and, considered, it, a, minor, issue, the, alsace, lorraine, issue, remained, a, minor, theme, after, 1880, and, republicans, and, socialists, systematically, downplayed, the, issue, return, did, not, become, a, french, war, aim, until, after, world, war, i, began
