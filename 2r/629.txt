uruk, known, today, as, warka, was, an, ancient, city, in, the, near, east, located, east, of, the, current, bed, of, the, euphrates, river, on, an, ancient, now, dried, channel, of, the, river, the, site, lies, 93, kilometers, 58, miles, northwest, of, ancient, ur, 108, kilometers, 67, miles, southeast, of, ancient, nippur, and, 24, kilometers, 15, miles, southeast, of, ancient, larsa, it, is, 30, km, 19, mi, east, of, modern, samawah, al, muthann, iraq, uruk, is, the, type, site, for, the, uruk, period, uruk, played, a, leading, role, in, the, early, urbanization, of, sumer, in, the, mid, 4th, millennium, bc, by, the, final, phase, of, the, uruk, period, around, 3100, bc, the, city, may, have, had, 40, 000, residents, with, 80, 000, 90, 000, people, living, in, its, environs, making, it, the, largest, urban, area, in, the, world, at, the, time, king, gilgamesh, according, to, the, chronology, presented, in, the, sumerian, king, list, henceforth, skl, ruled, uruk, in, the, 27th, century, bc, the, city, lost, its, prime, importance, around, 2000, bc, in, the, context, of, the, struggle, of, babylonia, against, elam, but, it, remained, inhabited, throughout, the, achaemenid, 550, 330, bc, seleucid, 312, 63, bc, and, parthian, 227, bc, to, ad, 224, periods, until, it, was, finally, abandoned, shortly, before, or, after, the, islamic, conquest, of, 633, 638, william, kennett, loftus, visited, the, site, of, uruk, in, 1849, identifying, it, as, erech, known, as, the, second, city, of, nimrod, and, led, the, first, excavations, from, 1850, to, 1854, uruk, r, k, has, several, spellings, in, cuneiform, in, sumerian, it, is, unug, in, akkadian, or, uruk, unug, its, names, in, other, languages, include, arabic, or, wark, or, auruk, classical, syriac, r, k, biblical, hebrew, re, ancient, greek, romanized, orkh, or, kh, r, geia, though, the, arabic, name, of, the, present, day, country, of, al, ir, q, is, often, thought, to, be, derived, directly, from, the, name, uruk, it, is, more, likely, loaned, via, middle, persian, er, q, and, then, aramaic, yrg, which, nonetheless, may, still, ultimately, refer, to, the, uruk, region, of, southern, mesopotamia, in, myth, and, literature, uruk, was, famous, as, the, capital, city, of, gilgamesh, hero, of, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, scholars, identify, uruk, as, the, biblical, erech, genesis, 10, 10, the, second, city, founded, by, nimrod, in, shinar, in, addition, to, being, one, of, the, first, cities, uruk, was, the, main, force, of, urbanization, and, state, formation, during, the, uruk, period, or, uruk, expansion, 4000, 3200, bc, this, period, of, 800, years, saw, a, shift, from, small, agricultural, villages, to, a, larger, urban, center, with, a, full, time, bureaucracy, military, and, stratified, society, although, other, settlements, coexisted, with, uruk, they, were, generally, about, 10, hectares, while, uruk, was, significantly, larger, and, more, complex, the, uruk, period, culture, exported, by, sumerian, traders, and, colonists, had, an, effect, on, all, surrounding, peoples, who, gradually, evolved, their, own, comparable, competing, economies, and, cultures, ultimately, uruk, could, not, maintain, long, distance, control, over, colonies, such, as, tell, brak, by, military, force, geographic, factors, underpin, uruk, s, unprecedented, growth, the, city, was, located, in, the, southern, part, of, mesopotamia, an, ancient, site, of, civilization, on, the, euphrates, river, through, the, gradual, and, eventual, domestication, of, native, grains, from, the, zagros, foothills, and, extensive, irrigation, techniques, the, area, supported, a, vast, variety, of, edible, vegetation, this, domestication, of, grain, and, its, proximity, to, rivers, enabled, uruk, s, growth, into, the, largest, sumerian, settlement, in, both, population, and, area, with, relative, ease, uruk, s, agricultural, surplus, and, large, population, base, facilitated, processes, such, as, trade, specialization, of, crafts, and, the, evolution, of, writing, writing, may, have, originated, in, uruk, around, 3300, bc, evidence, from, excavations, such, as, extensive, pottery, and, the, earliest, known, tablets, of, writing, support, these, events, excavation, of, uruk, is, highly, complex, because, older, buildings, were, recycled, into, newer, ones, thus, blurring, the, layers, of, different, historic, periods, the, topmost, layer, most, likely, originated, in, the, jemdet, nasr, period, 3100, 2900, bc, and, is, built, on, structures, from, earlier, periods, dating, back, to, the, ubaid, period, according, to, the, skl, uruk, was, founded, by, the, king, enmerkar, though, the, king, list, mentions, a, father, before, him, the, epic, enmerkar, and, the, lord, of, aratta, relates, that, enmerkar, constructed, the, house, of, heaven, sumerian, e, anna, cuneiform, e, an, for, the, goddess, inanna, in, the, eanna, district, of, uruk, in, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, gilgamesh, builds, the, city, wall, around, uruk, and, is, king, of, the, city, uruk, went, through, several, phases, of, growth, from, the, early, uruk, period, 4000, 3500, bc, to, the, late, uruk, period, 3500, 3100, bc, the, city, was, formed, when, two, smaller, ubaid, settlements, merged, the, temple, complexes, at, their, cores, became, the, eanna, district, and, the, anu, district, dedicated, to, inanna, and, anu, respectively, the, anu, district, was, originally, called, kullaba, kulab, or, unug, kulaba, prior, to, merging, with, the, eanna, district, kullaba, dates, to, the, eridu, period, when, it, was, one, of, the, oldest, and, most, important, cities, of, sumer, the, eanna, district, was, composed, of, several, buildings, with, spaces, for, workshops, and, it, was, walled, off, from, the, city, by, contrast, the, anu, district, was, built, on, a, terrace, with, a, temple, at, the, top, it, is, clear, eanna, was, dedicated, to, inanna, from, the, earliest, uruk, period, throughout, the, history, of, the, city, the, rest, of, the, city, was, composed, of, typical, courtyard, houses, grouped, by, profession, of, the, occupants, in, districts, around, eanna, and, anu, uruk, was, extremely, well, penetrated, by, a, canal, system, that, has, been, described, as, venice, in, the, desert, this, canal, system, flowed, throughout, the, city, connecting, it, with, the, maritime, trade, on, the, ancient, euphrates, river, as, well, as, the, surrounding, agricultural, belt, the, original, city, of, uruk, was, situated, southwest, of, the, ancient, euphrates, river, now, dry, currently, the, site, of, warka, is, northeast, of, the, modern, euphrates, river, the, change, in, position, was, caused, by, a, shift, in, the, euphrates, at, some, point, in, history, which, together, with, salination, due, to, irrigation, may, have, contributed, to, the, decline, of, uruk, archeologists, have, discovered, multiple, cities, of, uruk, built, atop, each, other, in, chronological, order, unlike, the, eanna, district, the, anu, district, consists, of, a, single, massive, terrace, the, anu, ziggurat, dedicated, to, the, sumerian, sky, god, anu, sometime, in, the, uruk, iii, period, the, massive, white, temple, was, built, atop, the, ziggurat, under, the, northwest, edge, of, the, ziggurat, an, uruk, vi, period, structure, the, stone, temple, has, been, discovered, the, stone, temple, was, built, of, limestone, and, bitumen, on, a, podium, of, rammed, earth, and, plastered, with, lime, mortar, the, podium, itself, was, built, over, a, woven, reed, mat, called, ipar, which, was, ritually, used, as, a, nuptial, bed, the, ipar, was, a, source, of, generative, power, which, then, radiated, upward, into, the, structure, the, structure, of, the, stone, temple, further, develops, some, mythological, concepts, from, enuma, elish, perhaps, involving, libation, rites, as, indicated, from, the, channels, tanks, and, vessels, found, there, the, structure, was, ritually, destroyed, covered, with, alternating, layers, of, clay, and, stone, then, excavated, and, filled, with, mortar, sometime, later, the, anu, ziggurat, began, with, a, massive, mound, topped, by, a, cella, during, the, uruk, period, c, 4000, bc, and, was, expanded, through, 14, phases, of, construction, these, phases, have, been, labeled, l, to, a, l, is, sometimes, called, x, the, earliest, phase, used, architectural, features, similar, to, ppna, cultures, in, anatolia, a, single, chamber, cella, with, a, terrazzo, floor, beneath, which, bucrania, were, found, in, phase, e, corresponding, to, the, uruk, iii, period, c, 3200, 3000, bc, the, white, temple, was, built, the, white, temple, could, be, seen, from, a, great, distance, across, the, plain, of, sumer, as, it, was, elevated, 21, m, and, covered, in, gypsum, plaster, which, reflected, sunlight, like, a, mirror, in, addition, to, this, temple, the, anu, ziggurat, had, a, monumental, limestone, paved, staircase, and, a, trough, running, parallel, to, the, staircase, was, used, to, drain, the, ziggurat, the, eanna, district, is, historically, significant, as, both, writing, and, monumental, public, architecture, emerged, here, during, uruk, periods, vi, iv, the, combination, of, these, two, developments, places, eanna, as, arguably, the, first, true, city, and, civilization, in, human, history, eanna, during, period, iva, contains, the, earliest, examples, of, writing, the, first, building, of, eanna, stone, cone, temple, mosaic, temple, was, built, in, period, vi, over, a, preexisting, ubaid, temple, and, is, enclosed, by, a, limestone, wall, with, an, elaborate, system, of, buttresses, the, stone, cone, temple, named, for, the, mosaic, of, colored, stone, cones, driven, into, the, adobe, brick, fa, ade, may, be, the, earliest, water, cult, in, mesopotamia, it, was, destroyed, by, force, in, uruk, ivb, period, and, its, contents, interred, in, the, riemchen, building, in, the, following, period, uruk, v, about, 100, m, east, of, the, stone, cone, temple, the, limestone, temple, was, built, on, a, 2, m, high, rammed, earth, podium, over, a, pre, existing, ubaid, temple, which, like, the, stone, cone, temple, represents, a, continuation, of, ubaid, culture, however, the, limestone, temple, was, unprecedented, for, its, size, and, use, of, stone, a, clear, departure, from, traditional, ubaid, architecture, the, stone, was, quarried, from, an, outcrop, at, umayyad, about, 60, km, east, of, uruk, it, is, unclear, if, the, entire, temple, or, just, the, foundation, was, built, of, this, limestone, the, limestone, temple, is, probably, the, first, inanna, temple, but, it, is, impossible, to, know, with, certainty, like, the, stone, cone, temple, the, limestone, temple, was, also, covered, in, cone, mosaics, both, of, these, temples, were, rectangles, with, their, corners, aligned, to, the, cardinal, directions, a, central, hall, flanked, along, the, long, axis, by, two, smaller, halls, and, buttressed, fa, ades, the, prototype, of, all, future, mesopotamian, temple, architectural, typology, between, these, two, monumental, structures, a, complex, of, buildings, called, a, c, e, k, riemchen, cone, mosaic, courts, and, walls, was, built, during, eanna, ivb, these, buildings, were, built, during, a, time, of, great, expansion, in, uruk, as, the, city, grew, to, 250, hectares, and, established, long, distance, trade, and, are, a, continuation, of, architecture, from, the, previous, period, the, riemchen, building, named, for, the, 16, 16, cm, brick, shape, called, riemchen, by, the, germans, is, a, memorial, with, a, ritual, fire, kept, burning, in, the, center, for, the, stone, cone, temple, after, it, was, destroyed, for, this, reason, uruk, iv, period, represents, a, reorientation, of, belief, and, culture, the, facade, of, this, memorial, may, have, been, covered, in, geometric, and, figural, murals, the, riemchen, bricks, first, used, in, this, temple, were, used, to, construct, all, buildings, of, uruk, iv, period, eanna, the, use, of, colored, cones, as, a, fa, ade, treatment, was, greatly, developed, as, well, perhaps, used, to, greatest, effect, in, the, cone, mosaic, temple, composed, of, three, parts, temple, n, the, round, pillar, hall, and, the, cone, mosaic, courtyard, this, temple, was, the, most, monumental, structure, of, eanna, at, the, time, they, were, all, ritually, destroyed, and, the, entire, eanna, district, was, rebuilt, in, period, iva, at, an, even, grander, scale, during, eanna, iva, the, limestone, temple, was, demolished, and, the, red, temple, built, on, its, foundations, the, accumulated, debris, of, the, uruk, ivb, buildings, were, formed, into, a, terrace, the, l, shaped, terrace, on, which, buildings, c, d, m, great, hall, and, pillar, hall, were, built, building, e, was, initially, thought, to, be, a, palace, but, later, proven, to, be, a, communal, building, also, in, period, iv, the, great, court, a, sunken, courtyard, surrounded, by, two, tiers, of, benches, covered, in, cone, mosaic, was, built, a, small, aqueduct, drains, into, the, great, courtyard, which, may, have, irrigated, a, garden, at, one, time, the, impressive, buildings, of, this, period, were, built, as, uruk, reached, its, zenith, and, expanded, to, 600, hectares, all, the, buildings, of, eanna, iva, were, destroyed, sometime, in, uruk, iii, for, unclear, reasons, the, architecture, of, eanna, in, period, iii, was, very, different, from, what, had, preceded, it, the, complex, of, monumental, temples, was, replaced, with, baths, around, the, great, courtyard, and, the, labyrinthine, rammed, earth, building, this, period, corresponds, to, early, dynastic, sumer, c, 2900, bc, a, time, of, great, social, upheaval, when, the, dominance, of, uruk, was, eclipsed, by, competing, city, states, the, fortress, like, architecture, of, this, time, is, a, reflection, of, that, turmoil, the, temple, of, inanna, continued, functioning, during, this, time, in, a, new, form, and, under, a, new, name, the, house, of, inanna, in, uruk, sumerian, e, inanna, unu, ga, the, location, of, this, structure, is, currently, unknown, although, it, had, been, a, thriving, city, in, early, dynastic, sumer, especially, early, dynastic, ii, uruk, was, ultimately, annexed, by, the, akkadian, empire, and, went, into, decline, later, in, the, neo, sumerian, period, uruk, enjoyed, revival, as, a, major, economic, and, cultural, center, under, the, sovereignty, of, ur, the, eanna, district, was, restored, as, part, of, an, ambitious, building, program, which, included, a, new, temple, for, inanna, this, temple, included, a, ziggurat, the, house, of, the, universe, cuneiform, e, sar, a, to, the, northeast, of, the, uruk, period, eanna, ruins, following, the, collapse, of, ur, c, 2000, bc, uruk, went, into, a, steep, decline, until, about, 850, bc, when, the, neo, assyrian, empire, annexed, it, as, a, provincial, capital, under, the, neo, assyrians, and, neo, babylonians, uruk, regained, much, of, its, former, glory, by, 250, bc, a, new, temple, complex, the, head, temple, akkadian, b, t, re, was, added, to, northeast, of, the, uruk, period, anu, district, the, b, t, re, along, with, the, esagila, was, one, of, the, two, main, centers, of, neo, babylonian, astronomy, all, of, the, temples, and, canals, were, restored, again, under, nabopolassar, during, this, era, uruk, was, divided, into, five, main, districts, the, adad, temple, royal, orchard, i, tar, gate, lugalirra, temple, and, ama, gate, districts, uruk, known, as, orcha, to, the, greeks, continued, to, thrive, under, the, seleucid, empire, during, this, period, uruk, was, a, city, of, 300, hectares, and, perhaps, 40, 000, inhabitants, in, 200, bc, the, great, sanctuary, cuneiform, e, iri, gal, sumerian, e, gal, of, ishtar, was, added, between, the, anu, and, eanna, districts, the, ziggurat, of, the, temple, of, anu, which, was, rebuilt, in, this, period, was, the, largest, ever, built, in, mesopotamia, when, the, seleucids, lost, mesopotamia, to, the, parthians, in, 141, bc, uruk, continued, in, use, the, decline, of, uruk, after, the, parthians, may, have, been, in, part, caused, by, a, shift, in, the, euphrates, river, by, 300, ad, uruk, was, mostly, abandoned, but, a, group, of, mandaeans, settled, there, and, by, c, 700, ad, it, was, completely, abandoned, uruk, played, a, very, important, part, in, the, political, history, of, sumer, starting, from, the, early, uruk, period, the, city, exercised, hegemony, over, nearby, settlements, at, this, time, c, 3800, bc, there, were, two, centers, of, 20, hectares, uruk, in, the, south, and, nippur, in, the, north, surrounded, by, much, smaller, 10, hectare, settlements, later, in, the, late, uruk, period, its, sphere, of, influence, extended, over, all, sumer, and, beyond, to, external, colonies, in, upper, mesopotamia, and, syria, in, uruk, in, southern, mesopotamia, sumerian, civilization, seems, to, have, reached, its, creative, peak, this, is, pointed, out, repeatedly, in, the, references, to, this, city, in, religious, and, especially, in, literary, texts, including, those, of, mythological, content, the, historical, tradition, as, preserved, in, the, sumerian, king, list, confirms, it, from, uruk, the, center, of, political, gravity, seems, to, have, moved, to, ur, the, recorded, chronology, of, rulers, over, uruk, includes, both, mythological, and, historic, figures, in, five, dynasties, as, in, the, rest, of, sumer, power, moved, progressively, from, the, temple, to, the, palace, rulers, from, the, early, dynastic, period, exercised, control, over, uruk, and, at, times, over, all, of, sumer, in, myth, kingship, was, lowered, from, heaven, to, eridu, then, passed, successively, through, five, cities, until, the, deluge, which, ended, the, uruk, period, afterwards, kingship, passed, to, kish, at, the, beginning, of, the, early, dynastic, period, which, corresponds, to, the, beginning, of, the, early, bronze, age, in, sumer, in, the, early, dynastic, i, period, 2900, 2800, bc, uruk, was, in, theory, under, the, control, of, kish, this, period, is, sometimes, called, the, golden, age, during, the, early, dynastic, ii, period, 2800, 2600, bc, uruk, was, again, the, dominant, city, exercising, control, of, sumer, this, period, is, the, time, of, the, first, dynasty, of, uruk, sometimes, called, the, heroic, age, however, by, the, early, dynastic, iiia, period, 2600, 2500, bc, uruk, had, lost, sovereignty, this, time, to, ur, this, period, corresponding, to, the, early, bronze, age, iii, is, the, end, of, the, first, dynasty, of, uruk, in, the, early, dynastic, iiib, period, 2500, 2334, bc, also, called, the, pre, sargonic, period, before, the, rise, of, the, akkadian, empire, under, sargon, of, akkad, uruk, continued, to, be, ruled, by, ur, dynastic, categorizations, are, described, solely, from, the, sumerian, king, list, which, is, of, problematic, historical, accuracy, the, organization, might, be, analogous, to, manetho, s, in, 2009, two, different, copies, of, an, inscription, were, put, forth, as, evidence, of, a, 19th, century, bc, ruler, of, uruk, named, naram, sin, uruk, continued, as, principality, of, ur, babylon, and, later, achaemenid, seleucid, and, parthian, empires, it, enjoyed, brief, periods, of, independence, during, the, isin, larsa, period, under, kings, such, as, possibly, ik, n, p, i, tar, c, 1800, bc, s, n, k, id, his, son, s, n, ir, bam, his, son, s, n, g, mil, ilum, g, mil, brother, of, s, n, g, mil, et, ia, anam, r, ne, ne, who, was, defeated, by, r, m, s, n, i, of, larsa, in, his, year, 14, c, 1740, bc, r, m, anum, and, nabi, il, u, it, is, now, believed, that, another, king, nar, m, s, n, briefly, ruled, before, s, n, k, id, the, city, was, finally, destroyed, by, the, arab, invasion, of, mesopotamia, and, abandoned, c, 700, ad, uruk, has, some, of, the, first, monumental, constructions, in, architectural, history, and, certainly, the, largest, of, its, era, much, of, near, eastern, architecture, can, trace, its, roots, to, these, prototypical, buildings, the, structures, of, uruk, are, cited, by, two, different, naming, conventions, one, in, german, from, the, initial, expedition, and, the, english, translation, of, the, same, the, stratigraphy, of, the, site, is, complex, and, as, such, much, of, the, dating, is, disputed, in, general, the, structures, follow, the, two, main, typologies, of, sumerian, architecture, tripartite, with, 3, parallel, halls, and, t, shaped, also, with, three, halls, but, the, central, one, extends, into, two, perpendicular, bays, at, one, end, the, following, table, summarizes, the, significant, architecture, of, the, eanna, and, anu, districts, temple, n, cone, mosaic, courtyard, and, round, pillar, hall, are, often, referred, to, as, a, single, structure, the, cone, mosaic, temple, it, is, clear, eanna, was, dedicated, to, inanna, symbolized, by, venus, from, the, uruk, period, at, that, time, she, was, worshipped, in, four, aspects, as, inanna, of, the, netherworld, sumerian, inanna, kur, inanna, of, the, morning, sumerian, inanna, hud, inanna, of, the, evening, sumerian, inanna, sig, and, inanna, sumerian, inanna, nun, the, names, of, four, temples, in, uruk, at, this, time, are, known, but, it, is, impossible, to, match, them, with, either, a, specific, structure, and, in, some, cases, a, deity, the, site, which, lies, about, 50, mi, 80, km, northwest, of, ancient, ur, is, one, of, the, largest, in, the, region, at, around, 5, 5, km, 2, 2, 1, sq, mi, in, area, the, maximum, extent, is, 3, km, 1, 9, mi, north, south, and, 2, 5, km, 1, 6, mi, east, west, there, are, three, major, tells, within, the, site, the, eanna, district, bit, resh, kullaba, and, irigal, archaeologically, the, site, is, divided, into, six, parts, 1, the, anna, ziggurat, egipar, imin, 2, the, anna, enclosure, zingel, 3, the, anu, antum, temple, complex, bitres, and, anu, ziggurat, 4, irigal, the, south, building, 5, parthian, structures, including, the, gareus, temple, and, the, multiple, apse, building, 6, the, gilgame, city, wall, with, associated, sink, sid, palace, and, the, seleucid, bit, ak, tu, the, location, of, uruk, was, first, noted, by, fraser, and, ross, in, 1835, william, loftus, excavated, there, in, 1850, and, 1854, after, a, scouting, mission, in, 1849, by, loftus, own, account, he, admits, that, the, first, excavations, were, superficial, at, best, as, his, financiers, forced, him, to, deliver, large, museum, artifacts, at, a, minimal, cost, warka, was, also, scouted, by, archaeologist, walter, andrae, in, 1902, in, 1905, warka, was, visited, by, archaeologist, edgar, james, banks, from, 1912, to, 1913, julius, jordan, and, his, team, from, the, german, oriental, society, discovered, the, temple, of, ishtar, one, of, four, known, temples, located, at, the, site, the, temples, at, uruk, were, quite, remarkable, as, they, were, constructed, with, brick, and, adorned, with, colorful, mosaics, jordan, also, discovered, part, of, the, city, wall, it, was, later, discovered, that, this, 40, to, 50, foot, 12, to, 15, m, high, brick, wall, probably, utilized, as, a, defense, mechanism, totally, encompassed, the, city, at, a, length, of, 9, km, 5, 6, mi, utilizing, sedimentary, strata, dating, techniques, this, wall, is, estimated, to,
