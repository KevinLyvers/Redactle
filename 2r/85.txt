late, antiquity, is, sometimes, defined, as, spanning, from, the, end, of, classical, antiquity, to, the, local, start, of, the, middle, ages, from, around, the, late, 3rd, century, up, to, the, 7th, or, 8th, century, in, europe, and, adjacent, areas, bordering, the, mediterranean, basin, depending, on, location, the, popularisation, of, this, periodization, in, english, has, generally, been, credited, to, historian, peter, brown, who, proposed, a, period, between, 150, 750, ad, the, oxford, centre, for, late, antiquity, defines, it, as, the, period, between, approximately, 250, and, 750, ad, precise, boundaries, for, the, period, are, a, continuing, matter, of, debate, in, the, west, its, end, was, earlier, with, the, start, of, the, early, middle, ages, typically, placed, in, the, 6th, century, or, even, earlier, on, the, edges, of, the, western, roman, empire, the, term, sp, tantike, literally, late, antiquity, has, been, used, by, german, speaking, historians, since, its, popularization, by, alois, riegl, in, the, early, 20th, century, it, was, given, currency, in, english, partly, by, the, writings, of, peter, brown, whose, survey, the, world, of, late, antiquity, 1971, revised, the, gibbon, view, of, a, stale, and, ossified, classical, culture, in, favour, of, a, vibrant, time, of, renewals, and, beginnings, and, whose, the, making, of, late, antiquity, offered, a, new, paradigm, of, understanding, the, changes, in, western, culture, of, the, time, in, order, to, confront, sir, richard, southern, s, the, making, of, the, middle, ages, the, continuities, between, the, later, roman, empire, as, it, was, reorganized, by, diocletian, r, 284, 305, and, the, early, middle, ages, are, stressed, by, writers, who, wish, to, emphasize, that, the, seeds, of, medieval, culture, were, already, developing, in, the, christianized, empire, and, that, they, continued, to, do, so, in, the, eastern, roman, empire, or, byzantine, empire, at, least, until, the, coming, of, islam, concurrently, some, migrating, germanic, tribes, such, as, the, ostrogoths, and, visigoths, saw, themselves, as, perpetuating, the, roman, tradition, while, the, usage, late, antiquity, suggests, that, the, social, and, cultural, priorities, of, classical, antiquity, endured, throughout, europe, into, the, middle, ages, the, usage, of, early, middle, ages, or, early, byzantine, emphasizes, a, break, with, the, classical, past, and, the, term, migration, period, tends, to, de, emphasize, the, disruptions, in, the, former, western, roman, empire, caused, by, the, creation, of, germanic, kingdoms, within, her, borders, beginning, with, the, foedus, with, the, goths, in, aquitania, in, 418, the, general, decline, of, population, technological, knowledge, and, standards, of, living, in, europe, during, this, period, became, the, archetypal, example, of, societal, collapse, for, writers, from, the, renaissance, as, a, result, of, this, decline, and, the, relative, scarcity, of, historical, records, from, europe, in, particular, the, period, from, roughly, the, early, fifth, century, until, the, carolingian, renaissance, or, later, still, was, referred, to, as, the, dark, ages, this, term, has, mostly, been, abandoned, as, a, name, for, a, historiographical, epoch, being, replaced, by, late, antiquity, in, the, periodization, of, the, late, western, roman, empire, the, early, byzantine, empire, and, the, early, middle, ages, the, roman, empire, underwent, considerable, social, cultural, and, organizational, changes, starting, with, the, reign, of, diocletian, who, began, the, custom, of, splitting, the, empire, into, eastern, and, western, portions, ruled, by, multiple, emperors, simultaneously, the, sasanian, empire, supplanted, the, parthian, empire, and, began, a, new, phase, of, the, roman, persian, wars, the, roman, sasanian, wars, the, divisions, between, the, greek, east, and, latin, west, became, more, pronounced, the, diocletianic, persecution, of, christians, in, the, early, 4th, century, was, ended, by, galerius, and, under, constantine, the, great, christianity, was, made, legal, in, the, empire, the, 4th, century, christianization, of, the, roman, empire, was, extended, by, the, conversions, of, tiridates, the, great, of, armenia, mirian, iii, of, iberia, and, ezana, of, axum, who, later, invaded, and, ended, the, kingdom, of, kush, during, the, late, 4th, century, reign, of, theodosius, i, nicene, christianity, was, proclaimed, the, state, church, of, the, roman, empire, the, city, of, constantinople, became, the, permanent, imperial, residence, in, the, east, by, the, 5th, century, and, superseded, rome, as, the, largest, city, in, the, late, roman, empire, and, the, mediterranean, basin, the, longest, roman, aqueduct, system, the, 250, km, 160, mi, long, aqueduct, of, valens, was, constructed, to, supply, it, with, water, and, the, tallest, roman, triumphal, columns, were, erected, there, migrations, of, germanic, hunnic, and, slavic, tribes, disrupted, roman, rule, from, the, late, 4th, century, onwards, culminating, first, in, the, sack, of, rome, by, the, visigoths, in, 410, and, subsequent, sack, of, rome, by, the, vandals, in, 455, part, of, the, eventual, collapse, of, the, empire, in, the, west, itself, by, 476, the, western, empire, was, replaced, by, the, so, called, barbarian, kingdoms, with, the, arian, christian, ostrogothic, kingdom, ruling, rome, from, ravenna, the, resultant, cultural, fusion, of, greco, roman, germanic, and, christian, traditions, formed, the, foundations, of, the, subsequent, culture, of, europe, in, the, 6th, century, roman, imperial, rule, continued, in, the, east, and, the, byzantine, sasanian, wars, continued, the, campaigns, of, justinian, the, great, led, to, the, fall, of, the, ostrogothic, and, vandal, kingdoms, and, their, reincorporation, into, the, empire, when, the, city, of, rome, and, much, of, italy, and, north, africa, returned, to, imperial, control, though, most, of, italy, was, soon, part, of, the, kingdom, of, the, lombards, the, roman, exarchate, of, ravenna, endured, ensuring, the, so, called, byzantine, papacy, justinian, constructed, the, hagia, sophia, a, great, example, of, byzantine, architecture, and, the, first, outbreak, of, the, centuries, long, first, plague, pandemic, took, place, at, ctesiphon, the, sasanians, completed, the, taq, kasra, the, colossal, iwan, of, which, is, the, largest, single, span, vault, of, unreinforced, brickwork, in, the, world, and, the, triumph, of, sasanian, architecture, the, middle, of, the, 6th, century, was, characterized, by, extreme, climate, events, the, volcanic, winter, of, 535, 536, and, the, late, antique, little, ice, age, and, a, disastrous, pandemic, the, plague, of, justinian, in, 541, the, effects, of, these, events, in, the, social, and, political, life, are, still, under, discussion, in, the, 7th, century, the, disastrous, byzantine, sasanian, war, of, 602, 628, and, the, campaigns, of, khosrow, ii, and, heraclius, facilitated, the, emergence, of, islam, in, the, arabian, peninsula, during, the, lifetime, of, muhammad, subsequent, muslim, conquest, of, the, levant, and, persia, overthrew, the, sasanian, empire, and, permanently, wrested, two, thirds, of, the, eastern, roman, empire, s, territory, from, roman, control, forming, the, rashidun, caliphate, the, byzantine, empire, under, the, heraclian, dynasty, began, the, middle, byzantine, period, and, together, with, the, establishment, of, the, later, 7th, century, umayyad, caliphate, generally, marks, the, end, of, late, antiquity, one, of, the, most, important, transformations, in, late, antiquity, was, the, formation, and, evolution, of, the, abrahamic, religions, christianity, rabbinic, judaism, and, eventually, islam, a, milestone, in, the, spread, of, christianity, was, the, conversion, of, emperor, constantine, the, great, r, 306, 337, in, 312, as, claimed, by, his, christian, panegyrist, eusebius, of, caesarea, although, the, sincerity, of, his, conversion, is, debated, constantine, confirmed, the, legalization, of, the, religion, through, the, so, called, edict, of, milan, in, 313, jointly, issued, with, his, rival, in, the, east, licinius, r, 308, 324, by, the, late, 4th, century, emperor, theodosius, the, great, had, made, christianity, the, state, religion, thereby, transforming, the, classical, roman, world, which, peter, brown, characterized, as, rustling, with, the, presence, of, many, divine, spirits, constantine, i, was, a, key, figure, in, many, important, events, in, christian, history, as, he, convened, and, attended, the, first, ecumenical, council, of, bishops, at, nicaea, in, 325, subsidized, the, building, of, churches, and, sanctuaries, such, as, the, church, of, the, holy, sepulchre, in, jerusalem, and, involved, himself, in, questions, such, as, the, timing, of, christ, s, resurrection, and, its, relation, to, the, passover, the, birth, of, christian, monasticism, the, 3rd, century, was, a, major, step, in, the, development, of, christian, spirituality, while, it, initially, operated, outside, the, episcopal, authority, of, the, church, it, would, become, hugely, successful, and, by, the, 8th, century, it, became, one, of, the, key, christian, practices, monasticism, was, not, the, only, new, christian, movement, to, appear, in, late, antiquity, although, it, had, perhaps, the, greatest, influence, and, it, achieved, unprecedented, geographical, spread, it, influenced, many, aspects, of, christian, religious, life, and, led, to, a, proliferation, of, various, ascetic, or, semi, ascetic, practices, holy, fools, and, stylites, counted, among, the, more, extreme, forms, but, through, such, personalities, like, john, chrysostom, jerome, augustine, or, gregory, the, great, monastic, attitudes, penetrated, other, areas, of, christian, life, late, antiquity, marks, the, decline, of, roman, state, religion, circumscribed, in, degrees, by, edicts, likely, inspired, by, christian, advisors, such, as, eusebius, to, 4th, century, emperors, and, a, period, of, dynamic, religious, experimentation, and, spirituality, with, many, syncretic, sects, some, formed, centuries, earlier, such, as, gnosticism, or, neoplatonism, and, the, chaldaean, oracles, some, novel, such, as, hermeticism, culminating, in, the, reforms, advocated, by, apollonius, of, tyana, being, adopted, by, aurelian, and, formulated, by, flavius, claudius, julianus, to, create, an, organized, but, short, lived, pagan, state, religion, that, ensured, its, underground, survival, into, the, byzantine, age, and, beyond, mah, y, na, buddhism, developed, in, india, and, along, the, silk, road, in, central, asia, while, manichaeism, a, dualist, faith, arose, in, mesopotamia, and, spread, both, east, and, west, for, a, time, contending, with, christianity, in, the, roman, empire, many, of, the, new, religions, relied, on, the, emergence, of, the, parchment, codex, bound, book, over, the, papyrus, volumen, scroll, the, former, allowing, for, quicker, access, to, key, materials, and, easier, portability, than, the, fragile, scroll, thus, fueling, the, rise, of, synoptic, exegesis, papyrology, notable, in, this, regard, is, the, topic, of, the, fifty, bibles, of, constantine, within, the, recently, legitimized, christian, community, of, the, 4th, century, a, division, could, be, more, distinctly, seen, between, the, laity, and, an, increasingly, celibate, male, leadership, these, men, presented, themselves, as, removed, from, the, traditional, roman, motivations, of, public, and, private, life, marked, by, pride, ambition, and, kinship, solidarity, and, differing, from, the, married, pagan, leadership, unlike, later, strictures, on, priestly, celibacy, celibacy, in, late, antique, christianity, sometimes, took, the, form, of, abstinence, from, sexual, relations, after, marriage, and, it, came, to, be, the, expected, norm, for, urban, clergy, celibate, and, detached, the, upper, clergy, became, an, elite, equal, in, prestige, to, urban, notables, the, potentes, or, dynatoi, islam, appeared, in, the, 7th, century, spurring, arab, armies, to, invade, the, eastern, roman, empire, and, the, sassanian, empire, of, persia, destroying, the, latter, after, conquering, all, of, north, africa, and, visigothic, spain, the, islamic, invasion, was, halted, by, charles, martel, at, the, battle, of, tours, in, modern, france, on, the, rise, of, islam, two, main, theses, prevail, on, the, one, hand, there, is, the, traditional, view, as, espoused, by, most, historians, prior, to, the, second, half, of, the, twentieth, century, and, after, and, by, muslim, scholars, this, view, the, so, called, out, of, arabia, thesis, holds, that, islam, as, a, phenomenon, was, a, new, alien, element, in, the, late, antique, world, related, to, this, is, the, pirenne, thesis, according, to, which, the, arab, invasions, marked, through, conquest, and, the, disruption, of, mediterranean, trade, routes, the, cataclysmic, end, of, late, antiquity, and, the, beginning, of, the, middle, ages, on, the, other, hand, there, is, a, more, recent, thesis, associated, with, scholars, in, the, tradition, of, peter, brown, in, which, islam, is, seen, to, be, a, product, of, the, late, antique, world, not, foreign, to, it, this, school, suggests, that, its, origin, within, the, shared, cultural, horizon, of, the, late, antique, world, explains, the, character, of, islam, and, its, development, such, historians, point, to, similarities, with, other, late, antique, religions, and, philosophies, especially, christianity, in, the, prominent, role, and, manifestations, of, piety, in, islam, in, islamic, asceticism, and, the, role, of, holy, persons, in, the, pattern, of, universalist, homogeneous, monotheism, tied, to, worldly, and, military, power, in, early, islamic, engagement, with, greek, schools, of, thought, in, the, apocalypticism, of, islamic, theology, and, in, the, way, the, quran, seems, to, react, to, contemporary, religious, and, cultural, issues, shared, by, the, late, antique, world, at, large, further, indication, that, arabia, and, thus, the, environment, in, which, islam, first, developed, was, a, part, of, the, late, antique, world, is, found, in, the, close, economic, and, military, relations, between, arabia, the, byzantine, empire, and, the, sassanian, empire, in, recent, years, the, period, of, late, antiquity, has, become, a, major, focus, in, the, fields, of, quranic, studies, and, islamic, origins, the, late, antique, period, also, saw, a, wholesale, transformation, of, the, political, and, social, basis, of, life, in, and, around, the, roman, empire, the, roman, citizen, elite, in, the, 2nd, and, 3rd, centuries, under, the, pressure, of, taxation, and, the, ruinous, cost, of, presenting, spectacular, public, entertainments, in, the, traditional, cursus, honorum, had, found, under, the, antonines, that, security, could, be, obtained, only, by, combining, their, established, roles, in, the, local, town, with, new, ones, as, servants, and, representatives, of, a, distant, emperor, and, his, traveling, court, after, constantine, centralized, the, government, in, his, new, capital, of, constantinople, dedicated, in, 330, the, late, antique, upper, classes, were, divided, among, those, who, had, access, to, the, far, away, centralized, administration, in, concert, with, the, great, landowners, and, those, who, did, not, although, they, were, well, born, and, thoroughly, educated, a, classical, education, and, the, election, by, the, senate, to, magistracies, was, no, longer, the, path, to, success, room, at, the, top, of, late, antique, society, was, more, bureaucratic, and, involved, increasingly, intricate, channels, of, access, to, the, emperor, the, plain, toga, that, had, identified, all, members, of, the, republican, senatorial, class, was, replaced, with, the, silk, court, vestments, and, jewelry, associated, with, byzantine, imperial, iconography, also, indicative, of, the, times, is, the, fact, that, the, imperial, cabinet, of, advisors, came, to, be, known, as, the, consistorium, or, those, who, would, stand, in, courtly, attendance, upon, their, seated, emperor, as, distinct, from, the, informal, set, of, friends, and, advisors, surrounding, the, augustus, the, later, roman, empire, was, in, a, sense, a, network, of, cities, archaeology, now, supplements, literary, sources, to, document, the, transformation, followed, by, collapse, of, cities, in, the, mediterranean, basin, two, diagnostic, symptoms, of, decline, or, as, many, historians, prefer, transformation, are, subdivision, particularly, of, expansive, formal, spaces, in, both, the, domus, and, the, public, basilica, and, encroachment, in, which, artisans, shops, invade, the, public, thoroughfare, a, transformation, that, was, to, result, in, the, souk, marketplace, burials, within, the, urban, precincts, mark, another, stage, in, dissolution, of, traditional, urbanistic, discipline, overpowered, by, the, attraction, of, saintly, shrines, and, relics, in, roman, britain, the, typical, 4th, and, 5th, century, layer, of, dark, earth, within, cities, seems, to, be, a, result, of, increased, gardening, in, formerly, urban, spaces, the, city, of, rome, went, from, a, population, of, 800, 000, in, the, beginning, of, the, period, to, a, population, of, 30, 000, by, the, end, of, the, period, the, most, precipitous, drop, coming, with, the, breaking, of, the, aqueducts, during, the, gothic, war, a, similar, though, less, marked, decline, in, urban, population, occurred, later, in, constantinople, which, was, gaining, population, until, the, outbreak, of, the, plague, of, justinian, in, 541, in, europe, there, was, also, a, general, decline, in, urban, populations, as, a, whole, the, period, of, late, antiquity, was, accompanied, by, an, overall, population, decline, in, almost, all, europe, and, a, reversion, to, more, of, a, subsistence, economy, long, distance, markets, disappeared, and, there, was, a, reversion, to, a, greater, degree, of, local, production, and, consumption, rather, than, webs, of, commerce, and, specialized, production, concurrently, the, continuity, of, the, eastern, roman, empire, at, constantinople, meant, that, the, turning, point, for, the, greek, east, came, later, in, the, 7th, century, as, the, eastern, roman, or, byzantine, empire, centered, around, the, balkans, north, africa, egypt, and, carthage, and, asia, minor, the, degree, and, extent, of, discontinuity, in, the, smaller, cities, of, the, greek, east, is, a, moot, subject, among, historians, the, urban, continuity, of, constantinople, is, the, outstanding, example, of, the, mediterranean, world, of, the, two, great, cities, of, lesser, rank, antioch, was, devastated, by, the, persian, sack, of, 540, followed, by, the, plague, of, justinian, 542, onwards, and, completed, by, earthquake, while, alexandria, survived, its, islamic, transformation, to, suffer, incremental, decline, in, favour, of, cairo, in, the, medieval, period, justinian, rebuilt, his, birthplace, in, illyricum, as, justiniana, prima, more, in, a, gesture, of, imperium, than, out, of, an, urbanistic, necessity, another, city, was, reputed, to, have, been, founded, according, to, procopius, panegyric, on, justinian, s, buildings, precisely, at, the, spot, where, the, general, belisarius, touched, shore, in, north, africa, the, miraculous, spring, that, gushed, forth, to, give, them, water, and, the, rural, population, that, straightway, abandoned, their, ploughshares, for, civilised, life, within, the, new, walls, lend, a, certain, taste, of, unreality, to, the, project, in, mainland, greece, the, inhabitants, of, sparta, argos, and, corinth, abandoned, their, cities, for, fortified, sites, in, nearby, high, places, the, fortified, heights, of, acrocorinth, are, typical, of, byzantine, urban, sites, in, greece, in, italy, populations, that, had, clustered, within, reach, of, roman, roads, began, to, withdraw, from, them, as, potential, avenues, of, intrusion, and, to, rebuild, in, typically, constricted, fashion, round, an, isolated, fortified, promontory, or, rocca, cameron, notes, similar, movement, of, populations, in, the, balkans, where, inhabited, centres, contracted, and, regrouped, around, a, defensible, acropolis, or, were, abandoned, in, favour, of, such, positions, elsewhere, in, the, western, mediterranean, the, only, new, cities, known, to, be, founded, in, europe, between, the, 5th, and, 8th, centuries, were, the, four, or, five, visigothic, victory, cities, reccopolis, in, the, province, of, guadalajara, is, one, the, others, were, victoriacum, founded, by, leovigild, which, may, survive, as, the, city, of, vitoria, though, a, 12th, century, re, foundation, for, this, city, is, given, in, contemporary, sources, lugo, id, est, luceo, in, the, asturias, referred, to, by, isidore, of, seville, and, ologicus, perhaps, ologitis, founded, using, basque, labour, in, 621, by, suinthila, as, a, fortification, against, the, basques, modern, olite, all, of, these, cities, were, founded, for, military, purposes, and, at, least, reccopolis, victoriacum, and, ologicus, in, celebration, of, victory, a, possible, fifth, visigothic, foundation, is, baiyara, perhaps, modern, montoro, mentioned, as, founded, by, reccared, in, the, 15th, century, geographical, account, kitab, al, rawd, al,

century, well, before, the, withdrawal, of, roman, governors, and, garrisons, but, the, process, might, well, have, stretched, well, into, the, fifth, century, historians, emphasizing, urban, continuities, with, the, anglo, saxon, period, depend, largely, on, the, post, roman, survival, of, roman, toponymy, aside, from, a, mere, handful, of, its, continuously, inhabited, sites, like, york, and, london, and, possibly, canterbury, however, the, rapidity, and, thoroughness, with, which, its, urban, life, collapsed, with, the, dissolution, of, centralized, bureaucracy, calls, into,

expense, of, amphitheaters, temples, libraries, porticoes, gymnasia, concert, and, lecture, halls, theaters, and, other, amenities, of, public, life, in, any, case, as, christianity, took, over, many, of, these, buildings, which, were, associated, with, pagan, cults, were, neglected, in, favor, of, building, churches, and, donating, to, the, poor, the, christian, basilica, was, copied, from, the, civic, structure, with, variations, the, bishop, took, the, chair, in, the, apse, reserved, in, secular, structures, for, the, magistrate, or, the, emperor, himself, as, the, representative, here, and, now, of, christ, pantocrator, the, ruler, of, all, his, characteristic, late, antique, icon, these, ecclesiastical, basilicas, e, g, st, john, lateran, and, st, peter, s, in, rome, were, themselves, outdone, by, justinian, s, hagia, sophia, a, staggering, display, of, later, roman, byzantine, power, and, architectural, taste, though, the, building, is, not, architecturally, a, basilica, in, the, former, western, roman, empire, almost, no, great, buildings, were, constructed, from, the, 5th, century, a, most, outstanding, example, is, the, basilica, of, san, vitale, in, ravenna, constructed, c, 530, at, a, cost, of, 26, 000, gold, solidi, or, 360, roman, pounds, of, gold, city, life, in, the, east, though, negatively, affected, by, the, plague, in, the, 6th, 7th, centuries, finally, collapsed, due, to, slavic, invasions, in, the, balkans, and, persian, destructions, in, anatolia, in, the, 620s, city, life, continued, in, syria, jordan, and, palestine, into, the, 8th, in, the, later, 6th, century, street, construction, was, still, undertaken, in, caesarea, maritima, in, palestine, and, edessa, was, able, to, deflect, chosroes, i, with, massive, payments, in, gold, in, 540, and, 544, before, it, was, overrun, in, 609, the, stylistic, changes, characteristic, of, late, antique, art, mark, the, end, of, classical, roman, art, and, the, beginnings, of, medieval, art, as, a, complicated, period, bridging, between, roman, art, and, later, medieval, styles, such, as, that, of, the, byzantines, the, late, antique, period, saw, a, transition, from, the, classical, idealized, realism, tradition, largely, influenced, by, ancient, greek, art, to, the, more, iconic, stylized, art, of, the, middle, ages, unlike, classical, art, late, antique, art, does, not, emphasize, the, beauty, and, movement, of, the, body, but, rather, hints, at, the, spiritual, reality, behind, its, subjects, additionally, mirroring, the, rise, of, christianity, and, the, collapse, of, the, western, roman, empire, painting, and, freestanding, sculpture, gradually, fell, from, favor, in, the, artistic, community, replacing, them, were, greater, interests, in, mosaics, architecture, and, relief, sculpture, as, the, soldier, emperors, such, as, maximinus, thrax, r, 235, 238, emerged, from, the, provinces, in, the, 3rd, century, they, brought, with, them, their, own, regional, influences, and, artistic, tastes, for, example, artists, jettisoned, the, classical, portrayal, of, the, human, body, for, one, that, was, more, rigid, and, frontal, this, is, markedly, evident, in, the, combined, porphyry, portrait, of, the, four, tetrarchs, in, venice, with, these, stubby, figures, clutching, each, other, and, their, swords, all, individualism, naturalism, roman, verism, and, greek, idealism, diminish, the, arch, of, constantine, in, rome, which, re, used, earlier, classicising, reliefs, together, with, ones, in, the, new, style, shows, the, contrast, especially, clearly, in, nearly, all, artistic, media, simpler, shapes, were, adopted, and, once, natural, designs, were, abstracted, additionally, hierarchy, of, scale, overtook, the, preeminence, of, perspective, and, other, classical, models, for, representing, spatial, organization, from, c, 300, early, christian, art, began, to, create, new, public, forms, which, now, included, sculpture, previously, distrusted, by, christians, as, it, was, so, important, in, pagan, worship, sarcophagi, carved, in, relief, had, already, become, highly, elaborate, and, christian, versions, adopted, new, styles, showing, a, series, of, different, tightly, packed, scenes, rather, than, one, overall, image, usually, derived, from, greek, history, painting, as, was, the, norm, soon, the, scenes, were, split, into, two, registers, as, in, the, dogmatic, sarcophagus, or, the, sarcophagus, of, junius, bassus, the, last, of, these, exemplifying, a, partial, revival, of, classicism, nearly, all, of, these, more, abstracted, conventions, could, be, observed, in, the, glittering, mosaics, of, the, era, which, during, this, period, moved, from, being, decoration, derivative, from, painting, used, on, floors, and, walls, likely, to, become, wet, to, a, major, vehicle, of, religious, art, in, churches, the, glazed, surfaces, of, the, tesserae, sparkled, in, the, light, and, illuminated, the, basilica, churches, unlike, their, fresco, predecessors, much, more, emphasis, was, placed, on, demonstrating, a, symbolic, fact, rather, than, on, rendering, a, realistic, scene, as, time, progressed, during, the, late, antique, period, art, become, more, concerned, with, biblical, themes, and, influenced, by, interactions, of, christianity, with, the, roman, state, within, this, christian, subcategory, of, roman, art, dramatic, changes, were, also, taking, place, in, the, depiction, of, jesus, jesus, christ, had, been, more, commonly, depicted, as, an, itinerant, philosopher, teacher, or, as, the, good, shepherd, resembling, the, traditional, iconography, of, hermes, he, was, increasingly, given, roman, elite, status, and, shrouded, in, purple, robes, like, the, emperors, with, orb, and, scepter, in, hand, this, new, type, of, depiction, is, variously, thought, to, be, derived, from, either, the, iconography, of, jupiter, or, of, classical, philosophers, as, for,

group, of, powerful, pagans, to, resist, christianity, as, in, the, late, 4th, century, symmachi, nicomachi, diptych, extravagant, hoards, of, silver, plate, are, especially, common, from, the, 4th, century, including, the, mildenhall, treasure, esquiline, treasure, hoxne, hoard, and, the, imperial, missorium, of, theodosius, i, in, the, field, of, literature, late, antiquity, is, known, for, the, declining, use, of, classical, greek, and, latin, and, the, rise, of, literary, cultures, in, syriac, armenian, georgian, ethiopic, arabic, and, coptic, it, also, marks, a, shift, in, literary, style, with, a, preference, for, encyclopedic, works, in, a, dense, and, allusive, style, consisting, of, summaries, of, earlier, works, anthologies, epitomes, often, dressed, up, in, elaborate, allegorical, garb, e, g, de, nuptiis, mercurii, et, philologiae, of, martianus, capella, and, the, de, arithmetica, de, musica, and, de, consolatione, philosophiae, of, boethius, both, later, key, works, in, medieval, education, the, 4th, and, 5th, centuries, also, saw, an, explosion, of, christian, literature, of, which, greek, writers, such, as, eusebius, of, caesarea, basil, of, caesarea, gregory, of, nazianzus, and, john, chrysostom, and, latin, writers, such, as, ambrose, of, milan, jerome, and, augustine, of, hippo, are, only, among, the, most, renowned, representatives, on, the, other, hand, authors, such, as, ammianus, marcellinus, 4th, century, and, procopius, of, caesarea, 6th, century, were, able, to, keep, the, tradition, of, classical, hellenistic, historiography, alive, in, the, byzantine, empire, one, genre, of, literature, among, christian, writers, in, this, period, was, the, hexaemeron, dedicated, to, the, composition, of, commentaries, homilies, and, treatises, concerned, with, the, exegesis, of, the, genesis, creation, narrative, the, first, example, of, this, was, the, hexaemeron, of, basil, of, caesarea, with, the, first, occurrence, in,
