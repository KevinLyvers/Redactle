the, renaissance, uk, r, n, e, s, n, s, r, n, ay, s, nss, us, r, n, s, n, s, ren, sahnss, is, a, period, of, history, and, a, european, cultural, movement, covering, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, it, marked, the, transition, from, the, middle, ages, to, modernity, and, was, characterized, by, an, effort, to, revive, and, surpass, the, ideas, and, achievements, of, classical, antiquity, associated, with, great, social, change, in, most, fields, and, disciplines, including, art, architecture, politics, literature, exploration, and, science, the, renaissance, was, first, centered, in, the, republic, of, florence, then, spread, to, the, rest, of, italy, and, later, throughout, europe, the, term, rinascita, rebirth, first, appeared, in, lives, of, the, artists, c, 1550, by, giorgio, vasari, while, the, corresponding, french, word, renaissance, was, adopted, into, english, as, the, term, for, this, period, during, the, 1830s, the, renaissance, s, intellectual, basis, was, founded, in, its, version, of, humanism, derived, from, the, concept, of, roman, humanitas, and, the, rediscovery, of, classical, greek, philosophy, such, as, that, of, protagoras, who, said, that, man, is, the, measure, of, all, things, although, the, invention, of, metal, movable, type, sped, the, dissemination, of, ideas, from, the, later, 15th, century, the, changes, of, the, renaissance, were, not, uniform, across, europe, the, first, traces, appear, in, italy, as, early, as, the, late, 13th, century, in, particular, with, the, writings, of, dante, and, the, paintings, of, giotto, as, a, cultural, movement, the, renaissance, encompassed, innovative, flowering, of, literary, latin, and, an, explosion, of, vernacular, literatures, beginning, with, the, 14th, century, resurgence, of, learning, based, on, classical, sources, which, contemporaries, credited, to, petrarch, the, development, of, linear, perspective, and, other, techniques, of, rendering, a, more, natural, reality, in, painting, and, gradual, but, widespread, educational, reform, it, saw, myriad, artistic, developments, and, contributions, from, such, polymaths, as, leonardo, da, vinci, and, michelangelo, who, inspired, the, term, renaissance, man, in, politics, the, renaissance, contributed, to, the, development, of, the, customs, and, conventions, of, diplomacy, and, in, science, to, an, increased, reliance, on, observation, and, inductive, reasoning, the, period, also, saw, revolutions, in, other, intellectual, and, social, scientific, pursuits, as, well, as, the, introduction, of, modern, banking, and, the, field, of, accounting, the, renaissance, period, started, during, the, crisis, of, the, late, middle, ages, and, conventionally, ends, by, the, 1600s, with, the, waning, of, humanism, and, the, advents, of, the, reformation, and, counter, reformation, and, in, art, the, baroque, period, it, had, a, different, period, and, characteristics, in, different, regions, such, as, the, italian, renaissance, the, northern, renaissance, the, spanish, renaissance, etc, in, addition, to, the, standard, periodization, proponents, of, a, long, renaissance, may, put, its, beginning, in, the, 14th, century, and, its, end, in, the, 17th, century, the, traditional, view, focuses, more, on, the, renaissance, s, early, modern, aspects, and, argues, that, it, was, a, break, from, the, past, but, many, historians, today, focus, more, on, its, medieval, aspects, and, argue, that, it, was, an, extension, of, the, middle, ages, the, beginnings, of, the, period, the, early, renaissance, of, the, 15th, century, and, the, italian, proto, renaissance, from, around, 1250, or, 1300, overlap, considerably, with, the, late, middle, ages, conventionally, dated, to, c, 1350, 1500, and, the, middle, ages, themselves, were, a, long, period, filled, with, gradual, changes, like, the, modern, age, as, a, transitional, period, between, both, the, renaissance, has, close, similarities, to, both, especially, the, late, and, early, sub, periods, of, either, the, renaissance, began, in, florence, one, of, the, many, states, of, italy, various, theories, have, been, proposed, to, account, for, its, origins, and, characteristics, focusing, on, a, variety, of, factors, including, florence, s, social, and, civic, peculiarities, at, the, time, its, political, structure, the, patronage, of, its, dominant, family, the, medici, and, the, migration, of, greek, scholars, and, their, texts, to, italy, following, the, fall, of, constantinople, to, the, ottoman, empire, other, major, centers, were, venice, genoa, milan, rome, during, the, renaissance, papacy, and, naples, from, italy, the, renaissance, spread, throughout, europe, and, also, to, american, african, and, asian, territories, ruled, by, the, european, colonial, powers, of, the, time, or, where, christian, missionaries, were, active, the, renaissance, has, a, long, and, complex, historiography, and, in, line, with, general, skepticism, of, discrete, periodizations, there, has, been, much, debate, among, historians, reacting, to, the, 19th, century, glorification, of, the, renaissance, and, individual, cultural, heroes, as, renaissance, men, questioning, the, usefulness, of, renaissance, as, a, term, and, as, a, historical, delineation, some, observers, have, questioned, whether, the, renaissance, was, a, cultural, advance, from, the, middle, ages, instead, seeing, it, as, a, period, of, pessimism, and, nostalgia, for, classical, antiquity, while, social, and, economic, historians, especially, of, the, longue, dur, e, have, instead, focused, on, the, continuity, between, the, two, eras, which, are, linked, as, panofsky, observed, by, a, thousand, ties, the, word, has, also, been, extended, to, other, historical, and, cultural, movements, such, as, the, carolingian, renaissance, 8th, and, 9th, centuries, ottonian, renaissance, 10th, and, 11th, century, and, the, renaissance, of, the, 12th, century, the, renaissance, was, a, cultural, movement, that, profoundly, affected, european, intellectual, life, in, the, early, modern, period, beginning, in, italy, and, spreading, to, the, rest, of, europe, by, the, 16th, century, its, influence, was, felt, in, art, architecture, philosophy, literature, music, science, technology, politics, religion, and, other, aspects, of, intellectual, inquiry, renaissance, scholars, employed, the, humanist, method, in, study, and, searched, for, realism, and, human, emotion, in, art, renaissance, humanists, such, as, poggio, bracciolini, sought, out, in, europe, s, monastic, libraries, the, latin, literary, historical, and, oratorical, texts, of, antiquity, while, the, fall, of, constantinople, 1453, generated, a, wave, of, migr, greek, scholars, bringing, precious, manuscripts, in, ancient, greek, many, of, which, had, fallen, into, obscurity, in, the, west, it, was, in, their, new, focus, on, literary, and, historical, texts, that, renaissance, scholars, differed, so, markedly, from, the, medieval, scholars, of, the, renaissance, of, the, 12th, century, who, had, focused, on, studying, greek, and, arabic, works, of, natural, sciences, philosophy, and, mathematics, rather, than, on, such, cultural, texts, in, the, revival, of, neoplatonism, renaissance, humanists, did, not, reject, christianity, on, the, contrary, many, of, the, renaissance, s, greatest, works, were, devoted, to, it, and, the, church, patronized, many, works, of, renaissance, art, but, a, subtle, shift, took, place, in, the, way, that, intellectuals, approached, religion, that, was, reflected, in, many, other, areas, of, cultural, life, in, addition, many, greek, christian, works, including, the, greek, new, testament, were, brought, back, from, byzantium, to, western, europe, and, engaged, western, scholars, for, the, first, time, since, late, antiquity, this, new, engagement, with, greek, christian, works, and, particularly, the, return, to, the, original, greek, of, the, new, testament, promoted, by, humanists, lorenzo, valla, and, erasmus, helped, pave, the, way, for, the, reformation, well, after, the, first, artistic, return, to, classicism, had, been, exemplified, in, the, sculpture, of, nicola, pisano, florentine, painters, led, by, masaccio, strove, to, portray, the, human, form, realistically, developing, techniques, to, render, perspective, and, light, more, naturally, political, philosophers, most, famously, niccol, machiavelli, sought, to, describe, political, life, as, it, really, was, that, is, to, understand, it, rationally, a, critical, contribution, to, italian, renaissance, humanism, giovanni, pico, della, mirandola, wrote, de, hominis, dignitate, oration, on, the, dignity, of, man, 1486, a, series, of, theses, on, philosophy, natural, thought, faith, and, magic, defended, against, any, opponent, on, the, grounds, of, reason, in, addition, to, studying, classical, latin, and, greek, renaissance, authors, also, began, increasingly, to, use, vernacular, languages, combined, with, the, introduction, of, the, printing, press, this, allowed, many, more, people, access, to, books, especially, the, bible, in, all, the, renaissance, can, be, viewed, as, an, attempt, by, intellectuals, to, study, and, improve, the, secular, and, worldly, both, through, the, revival, of, ideas, from, antiquity, and, through, novel, approaches, to, thought, political, philosopher, hans, kohn, describes, it, as, an, age, where, men, looked, for, new, foundations, some, like, erasmus, and, thomas, more, envisioned, new, reformed, spiritual, foundations, others, in, the, words, of, machiavelli, una, lunga, sperienza, delle, cose, moderne, ed, una, continua, lezione, delle, antiche, a, long, experience, with, modern, life, and, a, continuous, learning, from, antiquity, sociologist, rodney, stark, plays, down, the, renaissance, in, favor, of, the, earlier, innovations, of, the, italian, city, states, in, the, high, middle, ages, which, married, responsive, government, christianity, and, the, birth, of, capitalism, this, analysis, argues, that, whereas, the, great, european, states, france, and, spain, were, absolute, monarchies, and, others, were, under, direct, church, control, the, independent, city, republics, of, italy, took, over, the, principles, of, capitalism, invented, on, monastic, estates, and, set, off, a, vast, unprecedented, commercial, revolution, that, preceded, and, financed, the, renaissance, historian, leon, poliakov, offers, a, critical, view, in, his, seminal, study, of, european, racist, thought, the, aryan, myth, according, to, poliakov, the, use, of, ethnic, origin, myths, are, first, used, by, renaissance, humanists, in, the, service, of, a, new, born, chauvinism, many, argue, that, the, ideas, characterizing, the, renaissance, had, their, origin, in, florence, at, the, turn, of, the, 13th, and, 14th, centuries, in, particular, with, the, writings, of, dante, alighieri, 1265, 1321, and, petrarch, 1304, 1374, as, well, as, the, paintings, of, giotto, di, bondone, 1267, 1337, some, writers, date, the, renaissance, quite, precisely, one, proposed, starting, point, is, 1401, when, the, rival, geniuses, lorenzo, ghiberti, and, filippo, brunelleschi, competed, for, the, contract, to, build, the, bronze, doors, for, the, baptistery, of, the, florence, cathedral, ghiberti, won, others, see, more, general, competition, between, artists, and, polymaths, such, as, brunelleschi, ghiberti, donatello, and, masaccio, for, artistic, commissions, as, sparking, the, creativity, of, the, renaissance, yet, it, remains, much, debated, why, the, renaissance, began, in, italy, and, why, it, began, when, it, did, accordingly, several, theories, have, been, put, forward, to, explain, its, origins, peter, rietbergen, posits, that, various, influential, proto, renaissance, movements, started, from, roughly, 1300, onwards, across, many, regions, of, europe, in, stark, contrast, to, the, high, middle, ages, when, latin, scholars, focused, almost, entirely, on, studying, greek, and, arabic, works, of, natural, science, philosophy, and, mathematics, renaissance, scholars, were, most, interested, in, recovering, and, studying, latin, and, greek, literary, historical, and, oratorical, texts, broadly, speaking, this, began, in, the, 14th, century, with, a, latin, phase, when, renaissance, scholars, such, as, petrarch, coluccio, salutati, 1331, 1406, niccol, de, niccoli, 1364, 1437, and, poggio, bracciolini, 1380, 1459, scoured, the, libraries, of, europe, in, search, of, works, by, such, latin, authors, as, cicero, lucretius, livy, and, seneca, by, the, early, 15th, century, the, bulk, of, the, surviving, such, latin, literature, had, been, recovered, the, greek, phase, of, renaissance, humanism, was, under, way, as, western, european, scholars, turned, to, recovering, ancient, greek, literary, historical, oratorical, and, theological, texts, unlike, with, latin, texts, which, had, been, preserved, and, studied, in, western, europe, since, late, antiquity, the, study, of, ancient, greek, texts, was, very, limited, in, medieval, western, europe, ancient, greek, works, on, science, mathematics, and, philosophy, had, been, studied, since, the, high, middle, ages, in, western, europe, and, in, the, islamic, golden, age, normally, in, translation, but, greek, literary, oratorical, and, historical, works, such, as, homer, the, greek, dramatists, demosthenes, and, thucydides, were, not, studied, in, either, the, latin, or, medieval, islamic, worlds, in, the, middle, ages, these, sorts, of, texts, were, only, studied, by, byzantine, scholars, some, argue, that, the, timurid, renaissance, in, samarkand, and, herat, whose, magnificence, toned, with, florence, as, the, center, of, a, cultural, rebirth, were, linked, to, the, ottoman, empire, whose, conquests, led, to, the, migration, of, greek, scholars, to, italian, cities, one, of, the, greatest, achievements, of, renaissance, scholars, was, to, bring, this, entire, class, of, greek, cultural, works, back, into, western, europe, for, the, first, time, since, late, antiquity, muslim, logicians, most, notably, avicenna, and, averroes, had, inherited, greek, ideas, after, they, had, invaded, and, conquered, egypt, and, the, levant, their, translations, and, commentaries, on, these, ideas, worked, their, way, through, the, arab, west, into, iberia, and, sicily, which, became, important, centers, for, this, transmission, of, ideas, between, the, 11th, and, 13th, centuries, many, schools, dedicated, to, the, translation, of, philosophical, and, scientific, works, from, classical, arabic, to, medieval, latin, were, established, in, iberia, most, notably, the, toledo, school, of, translators, this, work, of, translation, from, islamic, culture, though, largely, unplanned, and, disorganized, constituted, one, of, the, greatest, transmissions, of, ideas, in, history, the, movement, to, reintegrate, the, regular, study, of, greek, literary, historical, oratorical, and, theological, texts, back, into, the, western, european, curriculum, is, usually, dated, to, the, 1396, invitation, from, coluccio, salutati, to, the, byzantine, diplomat, and, scholar, manuel, chrysoloras, c, 1355, 1415, to, teach, greek, in, florence, this, legacy, was, continued, by, a, number, of, expatriate, greek, scholars, from, basilios, bessarion, to, leo, allatius, the, unique, political, structures, of, italy, during, the, late, middle, ages, have, led, some, to, theorize, that, its, unusual, social, climate, allowed, the, emergence, of, a, rare, cultural, efflorescence, italy, did, not, exist, as, a, political, entity, in, the, early, modern, period, instead, it, was, divided, into, smaller, city, states, and, territories, the, neapolitans, controlled, the, south, the, florentines, and, the, romans, at, the, center, the, milanese, and, the, genoese, to, the, north, and, west, respectively, and, the, venetians, to, the, north, east, 15th, century, italy, was, one, of, the, most, urbanized, areas, in, europe, many, of, its, cities, stood, among, the, ruins, of, ancient, roman, buildings, it, seems, likely, that, the, classical, nature, of, the, renaissance, was, linked, to, its, origin, in, the, roman, empire, s, heartland, historian, and, political, philosopher, quentin, skinner, points, out, that, otto, of, freising, c, 1114, 1158, a, german, bishop, visiting, north, italy, during, the, 12th, century, noticed, a, widespread, new, form, of, political, and, social, organization, observing, that, italy, appeared, to, have, exited, from, feudalism, so, that, its, society, was, based, on, merchants, and, commerce, linked, to, this, was, anti, monarchical, thinking, represented, in, the, famous, early, renaissance, fresco, cycle, the, allegory, of, good, and, bad, government, by, ambrogio, lorenzetti, painted, 1338, 1340, whose, strong, message, is, about, the, virtues, of, fairness, justice, republicanism, and, good, administration, holding, both, church, and, empire, at, bay, these, city, republics, were, devoted, to, notions, of, liberty, skinner, reports, that, there, were, many, defences, of, liberty, such, as, the, matteo, palmieri, 1406, 1475, celebration, of, florentine, genius, not, only, in, art, sculpture, and, architecture, but, the, remarkable, efflorescence, of, moral, social, and, political, philosophy, that, occurred, in, florence, at, the, same, time, even, cities, and, states, beyond, central, italy, such, as, the, republic, of, florence, at, this, time, were, also, notable, for, their, merchant, republics, especially, the, republic, of, venice, although, in, practice, these, were, oligarchical, and, bore, little, resemblance, to, a, modern, democracy, they, did, have, democratic, features, and, were, responsive, states, with, forms, of, participation, in, governance, and, belief, in, liberty, the, relative, political, freedom, they, afforded, was, conducive, to, academic, and, artistic, advancement, likewise, the, position, of, italian, cities, such, as, venice, as, great, trading, centres, made, them, intellectual, crossroads, merchants, brought, with, them, ideas, from, far, corners, of, the, globe, particularly, the, levant, venice, was, europe, s, gateway, to, trade, with, the, east, and, a, producer, of, fine, glass, while, florence, was, a, capital, of, textiles, the, wealth, such, business, brought, to, italy, meant, large, public, and, private, artistic, projects, could, be, commissioned, and, individuals, had, more, leisure, time, for, study, one, theory, that, has, been, advanced, is, that, the, devastation, in, florence, caused, by, the, black, death, which, hit, europe, between, 1348, and, 1350, resulted, in, a, shift, in, the, world, view, of, people, in, 14th, century, italy, italy, was, particularly, badly, hit, by, the, plague, and, it, has, been, speculated, that, the, resulting, familiarity, with, death, caused, thinkers, to, dwell, more, on, their, lives, on, earth, rather, than, on, spirituality, and, the, afterlife, it, has, also, been, argued, that, the, black, death, prompted, a, new, wave, of, piety, manifested, in, the, sponsorship, of, religious, works, of, art, however, this, does, not, fully, explain, why, the, renaissance, occurred, specifically, in, italy, in, the, 14th, century, the, black, death, was, a, pandemic, that, affected, all, of, europe, in, the, ways, described, not, only, italy, the, renaissance, s, emergence, in, italy, was, most, likely, the, result, of, the, complex, interaction, of, the, above, factors, the, plague, was, carried, by, fleas, on, sailing, vessels, returning, from, the, ports, of, asia, spreading, quickly, due, to, lack, of, proper, sanitation, the, population, of, england, then, about, 4, 2, million, lost, 1, 4, million, people, to, the, bubonic, plague, florence, s, population, was, nearly, halved, in, the, year, 1347, as, a, result, of, the, decimation, in, the, populace, the, value, of, the, working, class, increased, and, commoners, came, to, enjoy, more, freedom, to, answer, the, increased, need, for, labor, workers, traveled, in, search, of, the, most, favorable, position, economically, the, demographic, decline, due, to, the, plague, had, economic, consequences, the, prices, of, food, dropped, and, land, values, declined, by, 30, 40, in, most, parts, of, europe, between, 1350, and, 1400, landholders, faced, a, great, loss, but, for, ordinary, men, and, women, it, was, a, windfall, the, survivors, of, the, plague, found, not, only, that, the, prices, of, food, were, cheaper, but, also, that, lands, were, more, abundant, and, many, of, them, inherited, property, from, their, dead, relatives, the, spread, of, disease, was, significantly, more, rampant, in, areas, of, poverty, epidemics, ravaged, cities, particularly, children, plagues, were, easily, spread, by, lice, unsanitary, drinking, water, armies, or, by, poor, sanitation, children, were, hit, the, hardest, because, many, diseases, such, as, typhus, and, congenital, syphilis, target, the, immune, system, leaving, young, children, without, a, fighting, chance, children, in, city, dwellings, were, more, affected, by, the, spread, of, disease, than, the, children, of, the, wealthy, the, black, death, caused, greater, upheaval, to, florence, s, social, and, political, structure, than, later, epidemics, despite, a, significant, number, of, deaths, among, members, of, the, ruling, classes, the, government, of, florence, continued, to, function, during, this, period, formal, meetings, of, elected, representatives, were, suspended, during, the, height, of, the, epidemic, due, to, the, chaotic, conditions, in, the, city, but, a, small, group, of, officials, was, appointed, to, conduct, the, affairs, of, the, city, which, ensured, continuity, of, government, it, has, long, been, a, matter, of, debate, why, the, renaissance, began, in, florence, and, not, elsewhere, in, italy, scholars, have, noted, several, features, unique, to, florentine, cultural, life, that, may, have, caused, such, a, cultural, movement, many, have, emphasized, the, role, played, by, the, medici, a, banking, family, and, later, ducal, ruling, house, in, patronizing, and, stimulating, the, arts, some, historians, have, postulated, that, florence, was, the, birthplace, of, the, renaissance, as, a, result, of, luck, i, e, because, great, men, were, born, there, by, chance, leonardo, botticelli, and, michelangelo, were, all, born, in, tuscany, arguing, that, such, chance, seems, improbable, other, historians, have, contended, that, these, great, men, were, only, able, to, rise, to, prominence, because, of, the, prevailing, cultural, conditions, at, the, time, lorenzo, de, medici, 1449, 1492, was, the, catalyst, for, an, enormous, amount, of, arts, patronage, encouraging, his, countrymen, to, commission, works, from, the, leading, artists, of, florence, including, leonardo, da, vinci, sandro, botticelli, and, michelangelo, buonarroti, works, by, neri, di, bicci, botticelli, leonardo, and, filippino, lippi, had, been, commissioned, additionally, by, the, convent, of, san, donato, in, scopeto, in, florence, the, renaissance, was, certainly, underway, before, lorenzo, de, medici, came, to, power, indeed, before, the, medici, family, itself, achieved, hegemony, in, florentine, society, in, some, ways, renaissance, humanism, was, not, a, philosophy, but, a, method, of, learning, in, contrast, to, the, medieval, scholastic, mode, which, focused, on, resolving, contradictions, between, authors, renaissance, humanists, would, study, ancient, texts, in, the, original, and, appraise, them, through, a, combination, of, reasoning, and, empirical, evidence, humanist, education, was, based, on, the, programme, of, studia, humanitatis, the, study, of, five, humanities, poetry, grammar, history, moral, philosophy, and, rhetoric, although, historians, have, sometimes, struggled, to, define, humanism, precisely, most, have, settled, on, a, middle, of, the, road, definition, the, movement, to, recover, interpret, and, assimilate, the, language, literature, learning, and, values, of, ancient, greece, and, rome, above, all, humanists, asserted, the, genius, of, man, the, unique, and, extraordinary, ability, of, the, human, mind, humanist, scholars, shaped, the, intellectual, landscape, throughout, the, early, modern, period, political, philosophers, such, as, niccol, machiavelli, and, thomas, more, revived, the, ideas, of, greek, and, roman, thinkers, and, applied, them, in, critiques, of, contemporary, government, following, the, islamic, steps, of, ibn, khaldun, pico, della, mirandola, wrote, the, manifesto, of, the, renaissance, the, oration, on, the, dignity, of, man, a, vibrant, defence, of, thinking, matteo, palmieri, 1406, 1475, another, humanist, is, most, known, for, his, work, della, vita, civile, on, civic, life, printed, 1528, which, advocated, civic, humanism, and, for, his, influence, in, refining, the, tuscan, vernacular, to, the, same, level, as, latin, palmieri, drew, on, roman, philosophers, and, theorists, especially, cicero, who, like, palmieri, lived, an, active, public, life, as, a, citizen, and, official, as, well, as, a, theorist, and, philosopher, and, also, quintilian, perhaps, the, most, succinct, expression, of, his, perspective, on, humanism, is, in, a, 1465, poetic, work, la, citt, di, vita, but, an, earlier, work, della, vita, civile, is, more, wide, ranging, composed, as, a, series, of, dialogues, set, in, a, country, house, in, the, mugello, countryside, outside, florence, during, the, plague, of, 1430, palmieri, expounds, on, the, qualities, of, the, ideal, citizen, the, dialogues, include, ideas, about, how, children, develop, mentally, and, physically, how, citizens, can, conduct, themselves, morally, how, citizens, and, states, can, ensure, probity, in, public, life, and, an, important, debate, on, the, difference, between, that, which, is, pragmatically, useful, and, that, which, is, honest, the, humanists, believed, that, it, is, important, to, transcend, to, the, afterlife, with, a, perfect, mind, and, body, which, could, be, attained, with, education, the, purpose, of, humanism, was, to, create, a, universal, man, whose, person, combined, intellectual, and, physical, excellence, and, who, was, capable, of, functioning, honorably, in, virtually, any, situation, this, ideology, was, referred, to, as, the, uomo, universale, an, ancient, greco, roman, ideal, education, during, the, renaissance, was, mainly, composed, of, ancient, literature, and, history, as, it, was, thought, that, the, classics, provided, moral, instruction, and, an, intensive, understanding, of, human, behavior, a, unique, characteristic, of, some, renaissance, libraries, is, that, they, were, open, to, the, public, these, libraries, were, places, where, ideas, were, exchanged, and, where, scholarship, and, reading, were, considered, both, pleasurable, and, beneficial, to, the, mind, and, soul, as, freethinking, was, a, hallmark, of, the, age, many, libraries, contained, a, wide, range, of, writers, classical, texts, could, be, found, alongside, humanist, writings, these, informal, associations, of, intellectuals, profoundly, influenced, renaissance, culture, an, essential, tool, of, renaissance, librarianship, was, the, catalog, that, listed, described, and, classified, a, library, s, books, some, of, the, richest, bibliophiles, built, libraries, as, temples, to, books, and, knowledge, a, number, of, libraries, appeared, as, manifestations, of, immense, wealth, joined, with, a, love, of, books, in, some, cases, cultivated, library, builders, were, also, committed, to, offering, others, the, opportunity, to, use, their, collections, prominent, aristocrats, and, princes, of, the, church, created, great, libraries, for, the, use, of, their, courts, called, court, libraries, and, were, housed, in, lavishly, designed, monumental, buildings, decorated, with, ornate, woodwork, and, the, walls, adorned, with, frescoes, murray, stuart, a, p, renaissance, art, marks, a, cultural, rebirth, at, the, close, of, the, middle, ages, and, rise, of, the, modern, world, one, of, the, distinguishing, features, of, renaissance, art, was, its, development, of, highly, realistic, linear, perspective, giotto, di, bondone, 1267, 1337, is, credited, with, first, treating, a, painting, as, a, window, into, space, but, it, was, not, until, the, demonstrations, of, architect, filippo, brunelleschi, 1377, 1446, and, the, subsequent, writings, of, leon, battista, alberti, 1404, 1472, that, perspective, was, formalized, as, an, artistic, technique, the, development, of, perspective, was, part, of, a, wider, trend, toward, realism, in, the, arts, painters, developed, other, techniques, studying, light, shadow, and, famously, in, the, case, of, leonardo, da, vinci, human, anatomy, underlying, these, changes, in, artistic, method, was, a, renewed, desire, to, depict, the, beauty, of, nature, and, to, unravel, the, axioms, of, aesthetics, with, the, works, of, leonardo, michelangelo, and, raphael, representing, artistic, pinnacles, that, were, much, imitated, by, other, artists, other, notable, artists, include, sandro, botticelli, working, for, the, medici, in, florence, donatello, another, florentine, and, titian, in, venice, among, others, in, the, low, countries, a, particularly, vibrant, artistic, culture, developed, the, work, of, hugo, van, der, goes, and, jan, van, eyck, was, particularly, influential, on, the, development, of, painting, in, italy, both, technically, with, the, introduction, of, oil, paint, and, canvas, and, stylistically, in, terms, of, naturalism, in, representation, later, the, work, of, pieter, brueghel, the, elder, would, inspire, artists, to, depict, themes, of, everyday, life, in, architecture, filippo, brunelleschi, was, foremost, in, studying, the, remains, of, ancient, classical, buildings, with, rediscovered, knowledge, from, the, 1st, century, writer, vitruvius, and, the, flourishing, discipline, of, mathematics, brunelleschi, formulated, the, renaissance, style, that, emulated, and, improved, on, classical, forms, his, major, feat, of, engineering, was, building, the, dome, of, florence, cathedral, another, building, demonstrating, this, style, is, the, basilica, of, sant, andrea, mantua, built, by, alberti, the, outstanding, architectural, work, of, the, high, renaissance, was, the, rebuilding, of, st, peter, s, basilica, combining, the, skills, of, bramante, michelangelo, raphael, sangallo, and, maderno, during, the, renaissance, architects, aimed, to, use, columns, pilasters, and, entablatures, as, an, integrated, system, the, roman, orders, types, of, columns, are, used, tuscan, and, composite, these, can, either, be, structural, supporting, an, arcade, or, architrave, or, purely, decorative, set, against, a, wall, in, the, form, of, pilasters, one, of, the, first, buildings, to, use, pilasters, as, an, integrated, system, was, in, the, old, sacristy, 1421, 1440, by, brunelleschi, arches, semi, circular, or, in, the, mannerist, style, segmental, are, often, used, in, arcades, supported, on, piers, or, columns, with, capitals, there, may, be, a, section, of, entablature, between, the, capital, and, the, springing, of, the, arch, alberti, was, one, of, the, first, to, use, the, arch, on, a, monumental, renaissance, vaults, do, not, have, ribs, they, are, semi, circular, or, segmental, and, on, a, square, plan, unlike, the, gothic, vault, which, is, frequently, rectangular, renaissance, artists, were, not, pagans, although, they, admired, antiquity, and, kept, some, ideas, and, symbols, of, the, medieval, past, nicola, pisano, c, 1220, c, 1278, imitated, classical, forms, by, portraying, scenes, from, the, bible, his, annunciation, from, the, pisa, baptistry, demonstrates, that, classical, models, influenced, italian, art, before, the, renaissance, took, root, as, a, literary, movement, applied, innovation, extended, to, commerce, at, the, end, of, the, 15th, century, luca, pacioli, published, the, first, work, on, bookkeeping, making, him, the, founder, of, accounting, the, rediscovery, of, ancient, texts, and, the, invention, of, the, printing, press, in, about, 1440, democratized, learning, and, allowed, a, faster, propagation, of, more, widely, distributed, ideas, in, the, first, period, of, the, italian, renaissance, humanists, favored, the, study, of, humanities, over, natural, philosophy, or, applied, mathematics, and, their, reverence, for, classical, sources, further, enshrined, the, aristotelian, and, ptolemaic, views, of, the, universe, writing, around, 1450, nicholas, of, cusa, anticipated, the, heliocentric, worldview, of, copernicus, but, in, a, philosophical, fashion, science, and, art, were, intermingled, in, the, early, renaissance, with, polymath, artists, such, as, leonardo, da, vinci, making, observational, drawings, of, anatomy, and, nature, leonardo, set, up, controlled, experiments, in, water, flow, medical, dissection, and, systematic, study, of, movement, and, aerodynamics, and, he, devised, principles, of, research, method, that, led, fritjof, capra, to, classify, him, as, the, father, of, modern, science, other, examples, of, da, vinci, s, contribution, during, this, period, include, machines, designed, to, saw, marbles, and, lift, monoliths, and, new, discoveries, in, acoustics, botany, geology, anatomy, and, mechanics, a, suitable, environment, had, developed, to, question, classical, scientific, doctrine, the, discovery, in, 1492, of, the, new, world, by, christopher, columbus, challenged, the, classical, worldview, the, works, of, ptolemy, in, geography, and, galen, in, medicine, were, found, to, not, always, match, everyday, observations, as, the, reformation, and, counter, reformation, clashed, the, northern, renaissance, showed, a, decisive, shift, in, focus, from, aristotelean, natural, philosophy, to, chemistry, and, the, biological, sciences, botany, anatomy, and, medicine, the, willingness, to, question, previously, held, truths, and, search, for, new, answers, resulted, in, a, period, of, major, scientific, advancements, some, view, this, as, a, scientific, revolution, heralding, the, beginning, of, the, modern, age, others, as, an, acceleration, of, a, continuous, process, stretching, from, the, ancient, world, to, the, present, day, significant, scientific, advances, were, made, during, this, time, by, galileo, galilei, tycho, brahe, and, johannes, kepler, copernicus, in, de, revolutionibus, orbium, coelestium, on, the, revolutions, of, the, heavenly, spheres, posited, that, the, earth, moved, around, the, sun, de, humani, corporis, fabrica, on, the, workings, of, the, human, body, by, andreas, vesalius, gave, a, new, confidence, to, the, role, of, dissection, observation, and, the, mechanistic, view, of, anatomy, another, important, development, was, in, the, process, for, discovery, the, scientific, method, focusing, on, empirical, evidence, and, the, importance, of, mathematics, while, discarding, much, of, aristotelian, science, early, and, influential, proponents, of, these, ideas, included, copernicus, galileo, and, francis, bacon, the, new, scientific, method, led, to, great, contributions, in, the, fields, of, astronomy, physics, biology, and, anatomy, during, the, renaissance, extending, from, 1450, to, 1650, every, continent, was, visited, and, mostly, mapped, by, europeans, except, the, south, polar, continent, now, known, as, antarctica, this, development, is, depicted, in, the, large, world, map, nova, totius, terrarum, orbis, tabula, made, by, the, dutch, cartographer, joan, blaeu, in, 1648, to, commemorate, the, peace, of, westphalia, in, 1492, christopher, columbus, sailed, across, the, atlantic, ocean, from, spain, seeking, a, direct, route, to, india, of, the, delhi, sultanate, he, accidentally, stumbled, upon, the, americas, but, believed, he, had, reached, the, east, indies, in, 1606, the, dutch, navigator, willem, janszoon, sailed, from, the, east, indies, in, the, dutch, east, india, company, ship, duyfken, and, landed, in, australia, he, charted, about, 300, km, of, the, west, coast, of, cape, york, peninsula, in, queensland, more, than, thirty, dutch, expeditions, followed, mapping, sections, of, the, north, west, and, south, coasts, in, 1642, 1643, abel, tasman, circumnavigated, the, continent, proving, that, it, was, not, joined, to, the, imagined, south, polar, continent, by, 1650, dutch, cartographers, had, mapped, most, of, the, coastline, of, the, continent, which, they, named, new, holland, except, the, east, coast, which, was, charted, in, 1770, by, james, cook, the, long, imagined, south, polar, continent, was, eventually, sighted, in, 1820, throughout, the, renaissance, it, had, been, known, as, terra, australis, or, australia, for, short, however, after, that, name, was, transferred, to, new, holland, in, the, nineteenth, century, the, new, name, of, antarctica, was, bestowed, on, the, south, polar, continent, from, this, changing, society, emerged, a, common, unifying, musical, language, in, particular, the, polyphonic, style, of, the, franco, flemish, school, the, development, of, printing, made, distribution, of, music, possible, on, a, wide, scale, demand, for, music, as, entertainment, and, as, an, activity, for, educated, amateurs, increased, with, the, emergence, of, a, bourgeois, class, dissemination, of, chansons, motets, and, masses, throughout, europe, coincided, with, the, unification, of, polyphonic, practice, into, the, fluid, style, that, culminated, in, the, second, half, of, the, sixteenth, century, in, the, work, of, composers, such, as, giovanni, pierluigi, da, palestrina, orlande, de, lassus, tom, s, luis, de, victoria, and, william, byrd, the, new, ideals, of, humanism, although, more, secular, in, some, aspects, developed, against, a, christian, backdrop, especially, in, the, northern, renaissance, much, if, not, most, of, the, new, art, was, commissioned, by, or, in, dedication, to, the, roman, catholic, church, however, the, renaissance, had, a, profound, effect, on, contemporary, theology, particularly, in, the, way, people, perceived, the, relationship, between, man, and, god, many, of, the, period, s, foremost, theologians, were, followers, of, the, humanist, method, including, erasmus, huldrych, zwingli, thomas, more, martin, luther, and, john, calvin, the, renaissance, began, in, times, of, religious, turmoil, the, late, middle, ages, was, a, period, of, political, intrigue, surrounding, the, papacy, culminating, in, the, western, schism, in, which, three, men, simultaneously, claimed, to, be, true, bishop, of, rome, while, the, schism, was, resolved, by, the, council, of, constance, 1414, a, resulting, reform, movement, known, as, conciliarism, sought, to, limit, the, power, of, the, pope, although, the, papacy, eventually, emerged, supreme, in, ecclesiastical, matters, by, the, fifth, council, of, the, lateran, 1511, it, was, dogged, by, continued, accusations, of, corruption, most, famously, in, the, person, of, pope, alexander, vi, who, was, accused, variously, of, simony, nepotism, and, fathering, children, most, of, whom, were, married, off, presumably, for, the, consolidation, of, power, while, a, cardinal, churchmen, such, as, erasmus, and, luther, proposed, reform, to, the, church, often, based, on, humanist, textual, criticism, of, the, new, testament, in, october, 1517, luther, published, the, ninety, five, theses, challenging, papal, authority, and, criticizing, its, perceived, corruption, particularly, with, regard, to, instances, of, sold, indulgences, the, 95, theses, led, to, the, reformation, a, break, with, the, roman, catholic, church, that, previously, claimed, hegemony, in, western, europe, humanism, and, the, renaissance, therefore, played, a, direct, role, in, sparking, the, reformation, as, well, as, in, many, other, contemporaneous, religious, debates, and, conflicts, pope, paul, iii, came, to, the, papal, throne, 1534, 1549, after, the, sack, of, rome, in, 1527, with, uncertainties, prevalent, in, the, catholic, church, following, the, reformation, nicolaus, copernicus, dedicated, de, revolutionibus, orbium, coelestium, on, the, revolutions, of, the, celestial, spheres, to, paul, iii, who, became, the, grandfather, of, alessandro, farnese, who, had, paintings, by, titian, michelangelo, and, raphael, as, well, as, an, important, collection, of, drawings, and, who, commissioned, the, masterpiece, of, giulio, clovio, arguably, the, last, major, illuminated, manuscript, the, farnese, hours, by, the, 15th, century, writers, artists, and, architects, in, italy, were, well, aware, of, the, transformations, that, were, taking, place, and, were, using, phrases, such, as, modi, antichi, in, the, antique, manner, or, alle, romana, et, alla, antica, in, the, manner, of, the, romans, and, the, ancients, to, describe, their, work, in, the, 1330s, petrarch, referred, to, pre, christian, times, as, antiqua, ancient, and, to, the, christian, period, as, nova, new, from, petrarch, s, italian, perspective, this, new, period, which, included, his, own, time, was, an, age, of, national, eclipse, leonardo, bruni, was, the, first, to, use, tripartite, periodization, in, his, history, of, the, florentine, people, 1442, bruni, s, first, two, periods, were, based, on, those, of, petrarch, but, he, added, a, third, period, because, he, believed, that, italy, was, no, longer, in, a, state, of, decline, flavio, biondo, used, a, similar, framework, in, decades, of, history, from, the, deterioration, of, the, roman, empire, 1439, 1453, humanist, historians, argued, that, contemporary, scholarship, restored, direct, links, to, the, classical, period, thus, bypassing, the, medieval, period, which, they, then, named, for, the, first, time, the, middle, ages, the, term, first, appears, in, latin, in, 1469, as, media, tempestas, middle, times, the, term, rinascita, rebirth, first, appeared, however, in, its, broad, sense, in, giorgio, vasari, s, lives, of, the, artists, 1550, revised, 1568, vasari, divides, the, age, into, three, phases, the, first, phase, contains, cimabue, giotto, and, arnolfo, di, cambio, the, second, phase, contains, masaccio, brunelleschi, and, donatello, the, third, centers, on, leonardo, da, vinci, and, culminates, with, michelangelo, it, was, not, just, the, growing, awareness, of, classical, antiquity, that, drove, this, development, according, to, vasari, but, also, the, growing, desire, to, study, and, imitate, nature, in, the, 15th, century, the, renaissance, spread, rapidly, from, its, birthplace, in, florence, to, the, rest, of, italy, and, soon, to, the, rest, of, europe, the, invention, of, the, printing, press, by, german, printer, johannes, gutenberg, allowed, the, rapid, transmission, of, these, new, ideas, as, it, spread, its, ideas, diversified, and, changed, being, adapted, to, local, culture, in, the, 20th, century, scholars, began, to, break, the, renaissance, into, regional, and, national, movements, the, elizabethan, era, in, the, second, half, of, the, 16th, century, is, usually, regarded, as, the, height, of, the, english, renaissance, many, scholars, see, its, beginnings, in, the, early, 16th, century, during, the, reign, of, henry, viii, the, english, renaissance, is, different, from, the, italian, renaissance, in, several, ways, the, dominant, art, forms, of, the, english, renaissance, were, literature, and, music, which, had, a, rich, flowering, visual, arts, in, the, english, renaissance, were, much, less, significant, than, in, the, italian, renaissance, the, english, renaissance, period, in, art, began, far, later, than, the, italian, which, had, moved, into, mannerism, by, the, 1530s, in, literature, the, later, part, of, the, 16th, century, saw, the, flowering, of, elizabethan, literature, with, poetry, heavily, influenced, by, italian, renaissance, literature, but, elizabethan, theatre, a, distinctive, native, style, writers, include, william, shakespeare, 1564, 1616, christopher, marlowe, 1564, 1593, edmund, spenser, 1552, 1599, sir, thomas, more, 1478, 1535, and, sir, philip, sidney, 1554, 1586, english, renaissance, music, competed, with, that, in, europe, with, composers, such, as, thomas, tallis, 1505, 1585, john, taverner, 1490, 1545, and, william, byrd, 1540, 1623, elizabethan, architecture, produced, the, large, prodigy, houses, of, courtiers, and, in, the, next, century, inigo, jones, 1573, 1652, who, introduced, palladian, architecture, to, england, elsewhere, sir, francis, bacon, 1561, 1626, was, the, pioneer, of, modern, scientific, thought, and, is, commonly, regarded, as, one, of, the, founders, of, the, scientific, revolution, the, word, renaissance, is, borrowed, from, the, french, language, where, it, means, re, birth, it, was, first, used, in, the, eighteenth, century, and, was, later, popularized, by, french, historian, jules, michelet, 1798, 1874, in, his, 1855, work, histoire, de, france, history, of, france, in, 1495, the, italian, renaissance, arrived, in, france, imported, by, king, charles, viii, after, his, invasion, of, italy, a, factor, that, promoted, the, spread, of, secularism, was, the, inability, of, the, church, to, offer, assistance, against, the, black, death, francis, i, imported, italian, art, and, artists, including, leonardo, da, vinci, and, built, ornate, palaces, at, great, expense, writers, such, as, fran, ois, rabelais, pierre, de, ronsard, joachim, du, bellay, and, michel, de, montaigne, painters, such, as, jean, clouet, and, musicians, such, as, jean, mouton, also, borrowed, from, the, spirit, of, the, renaissance, in, 1533, a, fourteen, year, old, catherine, de, medici, 1519, 1589, born, in, florence, to, lorenzo, de, medici, duke, of, urbino, and, madeleine, de, la, tour, d, auvergne, married, henry, ii, of, france, second, son, of, king, francis, i, and, queen, claude, though, she, became, famous, and, infamous, for, her, role, in, the, french, wars, of, religion, she, made, a, direct, contribution, in, bringing, arts, sciences, and, music, including, the, origins, of, ballet, to, the, french, court, from, her, native, florence, in, the, second, half, of, the, 15th, century, the, renaissance, spirit, spread, to, germany, and, the, low, countries, where, the, development, of, the, printing, press, ca, 1450, and, renaissance, artists, such, as, albrecht, d, rer, 1471, 1528, predated, the, influence, from, italy, in, the, early, protestant, areas, of, the, country, humanism, became, closely, linked, to, the, turmoil, of, the, reformation, and, the, art, and, writing, of, the, german, renaissance, frequently, reflected, this, dispute, however, the, gothic, style, and, medieval, scholastic, philosophy, remained, exclusively, until, the, turn, of, the, 16th, century, emperor, maximilian, i, of, habsburg, ruling, 1493, 1519, was, the, first, truly, renaissance, monarch, of, the, holy, roman, empire, after, italy, hungary, was, the, first, european, country, where, the, renaissance, appeared, the, renaissance, style, came, directly, from, italy, during, the, quattrocento, 1400s, to, hungary, first, in, the, central, european, region, thanks, to, the, development, of, early, hungarian, italian, relationships, not, only, in, dynastic, connections, but, also, in, cultural, humanistic, and, commercial, relations, growing, in, strength, from, the, 14th, century, the, relationship, between, hungarian, and, italian, gothic, styles, was, a, second, reason, exaggerated, breakthrough, of, walls, is, avoided, preferring, clean, and, light, structures, large, scale, building, schemes, provided, ample, and, long, term, work, for, the, artists, for, example, the, building, of, the, friss, new, castle, in, buda, the, castles, of, visegr, d, tata, and, v, rpalota, in, sigismund, s, court, there, were, patrons, such, as, pippo, spano, a, descendant, of, the, scolari, family, of, florence, who, invited, manetto, ammanatini, and, masolino, da, pannicale, to, hungary, the, new, italian, trend, combined, with, existing, national, traditions, to, create, a, particular, local, renaissance, art, acceptance, of, renaissance, art, was, furthered, by, the, continuous, arrival, of, humanist, thought, in, the, country, many, young, hungarians, studying, at, italian, universities, came, closer, to, the, florentine, humanist, center, so, a, direct, connection, with, florence, evolved, the, growing, number, of, italian, traders, moving, to, hungary, specially, to, buda, helped, this, process, new, thoughts, were, carried, by, the, humanist, prelates, among, them, vit, z, j, nos, archbishop, of, esztergom, one, of, the, founders, of, hungarian, humanism, during, the, long, reign, of, emperor, sigismund, of, luxemburg, the, royal, castle, of, buda, became, probably, the, largest, gothic, palace, of, the, late, middle, ages, king, matthias, corvinus, r, 1458, 1490, rebuilt, the, palace, in, early, renaissance, style, and, further, expanded, it, after, the, marriage, in, 1476, of, king, matthias, to, beatrice, of, naples, buda, became, one, of, the, most, important, artistic, centers, of, the, renaissance, north, of, the, alps, the, most, important, humanists, living, in, matthias, court, were, antonio, bonfini, and, the, famous, hungarian, poet, janus, pannonius, andr, s, hess, set, up, a, printing, press, in, buda, in, 1472, matthias, corvinus, s, library, the, bibliotheca, corviniana, was, europe, s, greatest, collections, of, secular, books, historical, chronicles, philosophic, and, scientific, works, in, the, 15th, century, his, library, was, second, only, in, size, to, the, vatican, library, however, the, vatican, library, mainly, contained, bibles, and, religious, materials, in, 1489, bartolomeo, della, fonte, of, florence, wrote, that, lorenzo, de, medici, founded, his, own, greek, latin, library, encouraged, by, the, example, of, the, hungarian, king, corvinus, s, library, is, part, of, unesco, world, heritage, matthias, started, at, least, two, major, building, projects, the, works, in, buda, and, visegr, d, began, in, about, 1479, two, new, wings, and, a, hanging, garden, were, built, at, the, royal, castle, of, buda, and, the, palace, at, visegr, d, was, rebuilt, in, renaissance, style, matthias, appointed, the, italian, chimenti, camicia, and, the, dalmatian, giovanni, dalmata, to, direct, these, projects, matthias, commissioned, the, leading, italian, artists, of, his, age, to, embellish, his, palaces, for, instance, the, sculptor, benedetto, da, majano, and, the, painters, filippino, lippi, and, andrea, mantegna, worked, for, him, a, copy, of, mantegna, s, portrait, of, matthias, survived, matthias, also, hired, the, italian, military, engineer, aristotele, fioravanti, to, direct, the, rebuilding, of, the, forts, along, the, southern, frontier, he, had, new, monasteries, built, in, late, gothic, style, for, the, franciscans, in, kolozsv, r, szeged, and, hunyad, and, for, the, paulines, in, fej, regyh, za, in, the, spring, of, 1485, leonardo, da, vinci, travelled, to, hungary, on, behalf, of, sforza, to, meet, king, matthias, corvinus, and, was, commissioned, by, him, to, paint, a, madonna, matthias, enjoyed, the, company, of, humanists, and, had, lively, discussions, on, various, topics, with, them, the, fame, of, his, magnanimity, encouraged, many, scholars, mostly, italian, to, settle, in, buda, antonio, bonfini, pietro, ranzano, bartolomeo, fonzio, and, francesco, bandini, spent, many, years, in, matthias, s, court, this, circle, of, educated, men, introduced, the, ideas, of, neoplatonism,

rinascita, in, his, book, the, lives, of, the, artists, published, 1550, in, the, book, vasari, attempted, to, define, what, he, described, as, a, break, with, the, barbarities, of, gothic, art, the, arts, he, held, had, fallen, into, decay, with, the, collapse, of, the, roman, empire, and, only, the, tuscan, artists, beginning, with, cimabue, 1240, 1301, and, giotto, 1267, 1337, began, to, reverse, this, decline, in, the, arts, vasari, saw, ancient, art, as, central, to, the, rebirth, of, italian, art, however, only, in, the, 19th, century, did, the, french, word, renaissance, achieve, popularity, in, describing, the, self, conscious, cultural, movement, based, on, revival, of, roman, models, that, began, in, the, late, 13th, century, french, historian, jules, michelet, 1798, 1874, defined, the, renaissance, in, his, 1855, work, histoire, de, france, as, an, entire, historical, period, whereas, previously, it, had, been, used, in, a, more, limited, sense, for, michelet, the, renaissance, was, more, a, development, in, science, than, in, art, and, culture, he, asserted, that, it, spanned, the, period, from, columbus, to, copernicus, to, galileo, that, is, from, the, end, of, the, 15th, century, to, the, middle, of, the, 17th, century, moreover, michelet, distinguished, between, what, he, called, the, bizarre, and, monstrous, quality, of, the, middle, ages, and, the, democratic, values, that, he, as, a, vocal, republican, chose, to, see, in, its, character, a, french, nationalist, michelet, also, sought, to, claim, the, renaissance, as, a, french, movement, the, swiss, historian, jacob, burckhardt, 1818, 1897, in, his, the, civilization, of, the, renaissance, in, italy, 1860, by, contrast, defined, the, renaissance, as, the, period, between, giotto, and, michelangelo, in, italy, that, is, the, 14th, to, mid, 16th, centuries, he, saw, in, the, renaissance, the, emergence, of, the, modern, spirit, of, individuality, which, the, middle, ages, had, stifled, his, book, was, widely, read, and, became, influential, in, the, development, of, the, modern, interpretation, of, the, italian, renaissance, more, recently, some, historians, have, been, much, less, keen, to, define, the, renaissance, as, a, historical, age, or, even, as, a, coherent, cultural, movement, the, historian, randolph, starn, of, the, university, of, california, berkeley, stated, in, 1998, rather, than, a, period, with, definitive, beginnings, and, endings, and, consistent, content, in, between, the, renaissance, can, be, and, occasionally, has, been, seen, as, a, movement, of, practices, and, ideas, to, which, specific, groups, and, identifiable, persons, variously, responded, in, different, times, and, places, it, would, be, in, this, sense, a, network, of, diverse, sometimes, converging, sometimes, conflicting, cultures, not, a, single, time, bound, culture, there, is, debate, about, the, extent, to, which, the, renaissance, improved, on, the, culture, of, the, middle, ages, both, michelet, and, burckhardt, were, keen, to, describe, the, progress, made, in, the, renaissance, toward, the, modern, age, burckhardt, likened, the, change, to, a, veil, being, removed, from, man, s, eyes, allowing, him, to, see, clearly, in, the, middle, ages, both, sides, of, human, consciousness, that, which, was, turned, within, as, that, which, was, turned, without, lay, dreaming, or, half, awake, beneath, a, common, veil, the, veil, was, woven, of, faith, illusion, and, childish, prepossession, through, which, the, world, and, history, were, seen, clad, in, strange, hues, on, the, other, hand, many, historians, now, point, out, that, most, of, the, negative, social, factors, popularly, associated, with, the, medieval, period, poverty, warfare, religious, and, political, persecution, for, example, seem, to, have, worsened, in, this, era, which, saw, the, rise, of, machiavellian, politics, the, wars, of, religion, the, corrupt, borgia, popes, and, the, intensified, witch, hunts, of, the, 16th, century, many, people, who, lived, during, the, renaissance, did, not, view, it, as, the, golden, age, imagined, by, certain, 19th, century, authors, but, were, concerned, by, these, social, maladies, significantly, though, the, artists, writers, and, patrons, involved, in, the, cultural, movements, in, question, believed, they, were, living, in, a, new, era, that, was, a, clean, break, from, the, middle, ages, some, marxist, historians, prefer, to, describe, the, renaissance, in, material, terms, holding, the, view, that, the, changes, in, art, literature, and, philosophy, were, part, of, a, general, economic, trend, from, feudalism, toward, capitalism, resulting, in, a, bourgeois, class, with, leisure, time, to, devote, to, the, arts, johan, huizinga, 1872, 1945, acknowledged, the, existence, of, the, renaissance, but, questioned, whether, it, was, a, positive, change, in, his, book, the, autumn, of, the, middle, ages, he, argued, that, the, renaissance, was, a, period, of, decline, from, the, high, middle, ages, destroying, much, that, was, important, the, medieval, latin, language, for, instance, had, evolved, greatly, from, the, classical, period, and, was, still, a, living, language, used, in, the, church, and, elsewhere, the, renaissance, obsession, with, classical, purity, halted, its, further, evolution, and, saw, latin, revert, to, its, classical, form, this, view, is, however, somewhat, contested, by, recent, studies, robert, s, lopez, has, contended, that, it, was, a, period, of, deep, economic, recession, meanwhile, george, sarton, and, lynn, thorndike, have, both, argued, that, scientific, progress, was, perhaps, less, original, than, has, traditionally, been, supposed, finally, joan, kelly, argued, that, the, renaissance, led, to, greater, gender, dichotomy, lessening, the, agency, women, had, had, during, the, middle, ages, some, historians, have, begun, to, consider, the, word, renaissance, to, be, unnecessarily, loaded, implying, an, unambiguously, positive, rebirth, from, the, supposedly, more, primitive, dark, ages, the, middle, ages, most, political, and, economic, historians, now, prefer, to, use, the, term, early, modern, for, this, period, and, a, considerable, period, afterwards, a, designation, intended, to, highlight, the, period, as, a, transitional, one, between, the, middle, ages, and, the, modern, era, others, such, as, roger, osborne, have, come, to, consider, the, italian, renaissance, as, a, repository, of, the, myths, and, ideals, of, western, history, in, general, and, instead, of, rebirth, of, ancient, ideas, as, a, period, of, great, innovation, the, art, historian, erwin, panofsky, observed, of, this, resistance, to, the, concept, of, renaissance, it, is, perhaps, no, accident, that, the, factuality, of, the, italian, renaissance, has, been, most, vigorously, questioned, by, those, who, are, not, obliged, to, take, a, professional, interest, in, the, aesthetic, aspects, of, civilization, historians, of, economic, and, social, developments, political, and, religious, situations, and, most, particularly, natural, science, but, only, exceptionally, by, students, of, literature, and, hardly, ever, by, historians, of, art, the, term, renaissance, has, also, been, used, to, define, periods, outside, of, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, in, the, earlier, medieval, period, charles, h, haskins, 1870, 1937, for, example, made, a, case, for, a, renaissance, of, the, 12th, century, other, historians, have, argued, for, a, carolingian, renaissance, in, the, 8th, and, 9th, centuries, ottonian, renaissance, in, the, 10th, century, and, for, the, timurid, renaissance, of, the, 14th, century, the, islamic, golden, age, has, been, also, sometimes, termed, with, the, islamic, renaissance, the, macedonian, renaissance, is, a, term, used, for, a, period, in, the, roman, empire, in, the, 9th, 11th, centuries, ce, other, periods, of, cultural, rebirth, in, modern, times, have, also, been, termed, renaissances, such, as, the, bengal, renaissance, tamil, renaissance, nepal, bhasa, renaissance, al, nahda, or, the, harlem, renaissance, the, term, can, also, be, used, in, cinema, in, animation, the, disney, renaissance, is, a, period, that, spanned, the, years, from, 1989, to, 1999, which, saw, the, studio, return, to, the, level, of, quality, not, witnessed, since, their, golden, age, of, animation, the, san, francisco, renaissance, was, a, vibrant, period, of, exploratory, poetry, and, fiction, writing, in, san, francisco, in, the, mid, 20th, century, rapid, accumulation, of, knowledge, which, has, characterized, the, development, of, science, since, the, 17th, century, had, never, occurred, before, that, time, the, new, kind, of, scientific, activity, emerged, only, in, a, few, countries, of, western, europe, and, it, was, restricted, to, that, small, area, for, about, two, hundred, years, since, the, 19th, century, scientific, knowledge, has, been, assimilated, by, the, rest, of, the, world
