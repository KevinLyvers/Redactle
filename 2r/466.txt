entirely, by, air, forces, the, british, officially, recognise, the, battle, s, duration, as, being, from, 10, july, until, 31, october, 1940, which, overlaps, the, period, of, large, scale, night, attacks, known, as, the, blitz, that, lasted, from, 7, september, 1940, to, 11, may, 1941, german, historians, do, not, follow, this, subdivision, and, regard, the, battle, as, a, single, campaign, lasting, from, july, 1940, to, may, 1941, including, the, blitz, the, primary, objective, of, the, german, forces, was, to, compel, britain, to, agree, to, a, negotiated, peace, settlement, in, july, 1940, the, air, and, sea, blockade, began, with, the, luftwaffe, mainly, targeting, coastal, shipping, convoys, as, well, as, ports, and, shipping, centres, such, as, portsmouth, on, 1, august, the, luftwaffe, was, directed, to, achieve, air, superiority, over, the, raf, with, the, aim, of, incapacitating, raf, fighter, command, 12, days, later, it, shifted, the, attacks, to, raf, airfields, and, infrastructure, as, the, battle, progressed, the, luftwaffe, also, targeted, factories, involved, in, aircraft, production, and, strategic, infrastructure, eventually, it, employed, terror, bombing, on, areas, of, political, significance, and, on, civilians, the, germans, had, rapidly, overwhelmed, france, and, the, low, countries, in, the, battle, of, france, leaving, britain, to, face, the, threat, of, invasion, by, sea, the, german, high, command, recognised, the, difficulties, of, a, seaborne, attack, while, the, royal, navy, controlled, the, english, channel, and, the, north, sea, on, 16, july, hitler, ordered, the, preparation, of, operation, sea, lion, as, a, potential, amphibious, and, airborne, assault, on, britain, to, follow, once, the, luftwaffe, had, air, superiority, over, the, channel, in, september, raf, bomber, command, night, raids, disrupted, the, german, preparation, of, converted, barges, and, the, luftwaffe, s, failure, to, overwhelm, the, raf, forced, hitler, to, postpone, and, eventually, cancel, operation, sea, lion, the, luftwaffe, proved, unable, to, sustain, daylight, raids, but, their, continued, night, bombing, operations, on, britain, became, known, as, the, blitz, germany, s, failure, to, destroy, britain, s, air, defences, and, force, it, out, of, the, war, was, the, first, major, german, defeat, in, the, second, world, war, the, battle, of, britain, takes, its, name, from, the, speech, given, by, prime, minister, winston, churchill, to, the, house, of, commons, on, 18, june, what, general, weygand, called, the, battle, of, france, is, over, i, expect, that, the, battle, of, britain, is, about, to, begin, strategic, bombing, during, world, war, i, introduced, air, attacks, intended, to, panic, civilian, targets, and, led, in, 1918, to, the, merger, of, the, british, army, and, navy, air, services, into, the, royal, air, force, raf, its, first, chief, of, the, air, staff, hugh, trenchard, was, among, the, military, strategists, in, the, 1920s, like, giulio, douhet, who, saw, air, warfare, as, a, new, way, to, overcome, the, bloody, stalemate, of, trench, warfare, interception, was, expected, to, be, nearly, impossible, with, fighter, planes, no, faster, than, bombers, their, slogan, was, that, the, bomber, will, always, get, through, and, that, the, only, defence, was, a, deterrent, bomber, force, capable, of, matching, retaliation, predictions, were, made, that, a, bomber, offensive, would, quickly, cause, thousands, of, deaths, and, civilian, hysteria, leading, to, capitulation, however, widespread, pacifism, following, the, horrors, of, the, first, world, war, contributed, to, a, reluctance, to, provide, resources, germany, was, forbidden, a, military, air, force, by, the, 1919, treaty, of, versailles, and, therefore, air, crew, were, trained, by, means, of, civilian, and, sport, flying, following, a, 1923, memorandum, the, deutsche, luft, hansa, airline, developed, designs, for, aircraft, such, as, the, junkers, ju, 52, which, could, carry, passengers, and, freight, but, also, be, readily, adapted, into, a, bomber, in, 1926, the, secret, lipetsk, fighter, pilot, school, began, training, germans, in, the, soviet, union, erhard, milch, organised, rapid, expansion, and, following, the, 1933, nazi, seizure, of, power, his, subordinate, robert, knauss, formulated, a, deterrence, theory, incorporating, douhet, s, ideas, and, tirpitz, s, risk, theory, this, proposed, a, fleet, of, heavy, bombers, to, deter, a, preventive, attack, by, france, and, poland, before, germany, could, fully, rearm, a, 1933, 34, war, game, indicated, a, need, for, fighters, and, anti, aircraft, protection, as, well, as, bombers, on, 1, march, 1935, the, luftwaffe, was, formally, announced, with, walther, wever, as, chief, of, staff, the, 1935, luftwaffe, doctrine, for, conduct, of, air, war, luftkriegf, hrung, set, air, power, within, the, overall, military, strategy, with, critical, tasks, of, attaining, local, and, temporary, air, superiority, and, providing, battlefield, support, for, army, and, naval, forces, strategic, bombing, of, industries, and, transport, could, be, decisive, longer, term, options, dependent, on, opportunity, or, preparations, by, the, army, and, navy, it, could, be, used, to, overcome, a, stalemate, or, used, when, only, destruction, of, the, enemy, s, economy, would, be, conclusive, the, list, excluded, bombing, civilians, to, destroy, homes, or, undermine, morale, as, that, was, considered, a, waste, of, strategic, effort, but, the, doctrine, allowed, revenge, attacks, if, german, civilians, were, bombed, a, revised, edition, was, issued, in, 1940, and, the, continuing, central, principle, of, luftwaffe, doctrine, was, that, destruction, of, enemy, armed, forces, was, of, primary, importance, the, raf, responded, to, luftwaffe, developments, with, its, 1934, expansion, plan, a, rearmament, scheme, and, in, 1936, it, was, restructured, into, bomber, command, coastal, command, training, command, and, fighter, command, the, last, was, under, hugh, dowding, who, opposed, the, doctrine, that, bombers, were, unstoppable, the, invention, of, radar, at, that, time, could, allow, early, detection, and, prototype, monoplane, fighters, were, significantly, faster, priorities, were, disputed, but, in, december, 1937, the, minister, in, charge, of, defence, coordination, sir, thomas, inskip, sided, with, dowding, that, the, role, of, our, air, force, is, not, an, early, knock, out, blow, but, rather, was, to, prevent, the, germans, from, knocking, us, out, and, fighter, squadrons, were, just, as, necessary, as, bomber, squadrons, the, spanish, civil, war, 1936, 1939, gave, the, luftwaffe, condor, legion, the, opportunity, to, test, air, fighting, tactics, with, their, new, aeroplanes, wolfram, von, richthofen, became, an, exponent, of, air, power, providing, ground, support, to, other, services, the, difficulty, of, accurately, hitting, targets, prompted, ernst, udet, to, require, that, all, new, bombers, had, to, be, dive, bombers, and, led, to, the, development, of, the, knickebein, system, for, night, time, navigation, priority, was, given, to, producing, large, numbers, of, smaller, aeroplanes, and, plans, for, a, long, range, four, engined, strategic, bomber, were, cancelled, the, early, stages, of, the, second, world, war, saw, successful, german, invasions, on, the, continent, aided, decisively, by, the, air, power, of, the, luftwaffe, which, was, able, to, establish, tactical, air, superiority, with, great, effectiveness, the, speed, with, which, german, forces, defeated, most, of, the, defending, armies, in, norway, in, early, 1940, created, a, significant, political, crisis, in, britain, in, early, may, 1940, the, norway, debate, questioned, the, fitness, for, office, of, the, british, prime, minister, neville, chamberlain, on, 10, may, the, same, day, winston, churchill, became, british, prime, minister, the, germans, initiated, the, battle, of, france, with, an, aggressive, invasion, of, french, territory, raf, fighter, command, was, desperately, short, of, trained, pilots, and, aircraft, churchill, sent, fighter, squadrons, the, air, component, of, the, british, expeditionary, force, to, support, operations, in, france, where, the, raf, suffered, heavy, losses, this, was, despite, the, objections, of, its, commander, hugh, dowding, that, the, diversion, of, his, forces, would, leave, home, defences, under, strength, after, the, evacuation, of, british, and, french, soldiers, from, dunkirk, and, the, french, surrender, on, 22, june, 1940, hitler, mainly, focused, his, energies, on, the, possibility, of, invading, the, soviet, union, he, believed, that, the, british, defeated, on, the, continent, and, without, european, allies, would, quickly, come, to, terms, the, germans, were, so, convinced, of, an, imminent, armistice, that, they, began, constructing, street, decorations, for, the, homecoming, parades, of, victorious, troops, although, the, british, foreign, secretary, lord, halifax, and, certain, elements, of, the, british, public, favoured, a, negotiated, peace, with, an, ascendant, germany, churchill, and, a, majority, of, his, cabinet, refused, to, consider, an, armistice, instead, churchill, used, his, skilful, rhetoric, to, harden, public, opinion, against, capitulation, and, prepare, the, british, for, a, long, war, the, battle, of, britain, has, the, unusual, distinction, that, it, gained, its, name, before, being, fought, the, name, is, derived, from, the, this, was, their, finest, hour, speech, delivered, by, winston, churchill, in, the, house, of, commons, on, 18, june, more, than, three, weeks, prior, to, the, generally, accepted, date, for, the, start, of, the, battle, what, general, weygand, called, the, battle, of, france, is, over, i, expect, that, the, battle, of, britain, is, about, to, begin, upon, this, battle, depends, the, survival, of, christian, civilization, upon, it, depends, our, own, british, life, and, the, long, continuity, of, our, institutions, and, our, empire, the, whole, fury, and, might, of, the, enemy, must, very, soon, be, turned, on, us, hitler, knows, that, he, will, have, to, break, us, in, this, island, or, lose, the, war, if, we, can, stand, up, to, him, all, europe, may, be, free, and, the, life, of, the, world, may, move, forward, into, broad, sunlit, uplands, but, if, we, fail, then, the, whole, world, including, the, united, states, including, all, that, we, have, known, and, cared, for, will, sink, into, the, abyss, of, a, new, dark, age, made, more, sinister, and, perhaps, more, protracted, by, the, lights, of, a, perverted, science, let, us, therefore, brace, ourselves, to, our, duties, and, so, bear, ourselves, that, if, the, british, empire, and, its, commonwealth, last, for, a, thousand, years, men, will, still, say, this, was, their, finest, hour, from, the, outset, of, his, rise, to, power, adolf, hitler, expressed, admiration, for, britain, and, throughout, the, battle, period, he, sought, neutrality, or, a, peace, treaty, with, britain, in, a, secret, conference, on, 23, may, 1939, hitler, set, out, his, rather, contradictory, strategy, that, an, attack, on, poland, was, essential, and, will, only, be, successful, if, the, western, powers, keep, out, of, it, if, this, is, impossible, then, it, will, be, better, to, attack, in, the, west, and, to, settle, poland, at, the, same, time, with, a, surprise, attack, if, holland, and, belgium, are, successfully, occupied, and, held, and, if, france, is, also, defeated, the, fundamental, conditions, for, a, successful, war, against, england, will, have, been, secured, england, can, then, be, blockaded, from, western, france, at, close, quarters, by, the, air, force, while, the, navy, with, its, submarines, extend, the, range, of, the, blockade, when, war, commenced, hitler, and, the, okw, oberkommando, der, wehrmacht, or, high, command, of, the, armed, forces, issued, a, series, of, directives, ordering, planning, and, stating, strategic, objectives, directive, no, 1, for, the, conduct, of, the, war, dated, 31, august, 1939, instructed, the, invasion, of, poland, on, 1, september, as, planned, potentially, luftwaffe, operations, against, england, were, to, dislocate, english, imports, the, armaments, industry, and, the, transport, of, troops, to, france, any, favourable, opportunity, of, an, effective, attack, on, concentrated, units, of, the, english, navy, particularly, on, battleships, or, aircraft, carriers, will, be, exploited, the, decision, regarding, attacks, on, london, is, reserved, to, me, attacks, on, the, english, homeland, are, to, be, prepared, bearing, in, mind, that, inconclusive, results, with, insufficient, forces, are, to, be, avoided, in, all, circumstances, both, france, and, the, uk, declared, war, on, germany, on, 9, october, hitler, s, directive, no, 6, planned, the, offensive, to, defeat, these, allies, and, win, as, much, territory, as, possible, in, the, netherlands, belgium, and, northern, france, to, serve, as, a, base, for, the, successful, prosecution, of, the, air, and, sea, war, against, england, on, 29, november, okw, directive, no, 9, instructions, for, warfare, against, the, economy, of, the, enemy, stated, that, once, this, coastline, had, been, secured, the, luftwaffe, together, with, the, kriegsmarine, german, navy, was, to, blockade, uk, ports, with, sea, mines, they, were, to, attack, shipping, and, warships, and, make, air, attacks, on, shore, installations, and, industrial, production, this, directive, remained, in, force, in, the, first, phase, of, the, battle, of, britain, it, was, reinforced, on, 24, may, during, the, battle, of, france, by, directive, no, 13, which, authorised, the, luftwaffe, to, attack, the, english, homeland, in, the, fullest, manner, as, soon, as, sufficient, forces, are, available, this, attack, will, be, opened, by, an, annihilating, reprisal, for, english, attacks, on, the, ruhr, basin, by, the, end, of, june, 1940, germany, had, defeated, britain, s, allies, on, the, continent, and, on, 30, june, the, okw, chief, of, staff, alfred, jodl, issued, his, review, of, options, to, increase, pressure, on, britain, to, agree, to, a, negotiated, peace, the, first, priority, was, to, eliminate, the, raf, and, gain, air, supremacy, intensified, air, attacks, against, shipping, and, the, economy, could, affect, food, supplies, and, civilian, morale, in, the, long, term, reprisal, attacks, of, terror, bombing, had, the, potential, to, cause, quicker, capitulation, but, the, effect, on, morale, was, uncertain, on, the, same, day, the, luftwaffe, commander, in, chief, hermann, g, ring, issued, his, operational, directive, to, destroy, the, raf, thus, protecting, german, industry, and, also, to, block, overseas, supplies, to, britain, the, german, supreme, command, argued, over, the, practicality, of, these, options, in, directive, no, 16, on, preparations, for, a, landing, operation, against, england, on, 16, july, hitler, required, readiness, by, mid, august, for, the, possibility, of, an, invasion, he, called, operation, sea, lion, unless, the, british, agreed, to, negotiations, the, luftwaffe, reported, that, it, would, be, ready, to, launch, its, major, attack, early, in, august, the, kriegsmarine, commander, in, chief, grand, admiral, erich, raeder, continued, to, highlight, the, impracticality, of, these, plans, and, said, sea, invasion, could, not, take, place, before, early, 1941, hitler, now, argued, that, britain, was, holding, out, in, hope, of, assistance, from, russia, and, the, soviet, union, was, to, be, invaded, by, mid, 1941, g, ring, met, his, air, fleet, commanders, and, on, 24, july, issued, tasks, and, goals, of, firstly, gaining, air, supremacy, secondly, protecting, invasion, forces, and, attacking, the, royal, navy, s, ships, thirdly, they, were, to, blockade, imports, bombing, harbours, and, stores, of, supplies, hitler, s, directive, no, 17, for, the, conduct, of, air, and, sea, warfare, against, england, issued, on, 1, august, attempted, to, keep, all, the, options, open, the, luftwaffe, s, adlertag, campaign, was, to, start, around, 5, august, subject, to, weather, with, the, aim, of, gaining, air, superiority, over, southern, england, as, a, necessary, precondition, of, invasion, to, give, credibility, to, the, threat, and, give, hitler, the, option, of, ordering, the, invasion, the, intention, was, to, incapacitate, the, raf, so, much, that, the, uk, would, feel, open, to, air, attack, and, would, begin, peace, negotiations, it, was, also, to, isolate, the, uk, and, damage, war, production, beginning, an, effective, blockade, following, severe, luftwaffe, losses, hitler, agreed, at, a, 14, september, okw, conference, that, the, air, campaign, was, to, intensify, regardless, of, invasion, plans, on, 16, september, g, ring, gave, the, order, for, this, change, in, strategy, to, the, first, independent, strategic, bombing, campaign, hitler, s, 1925, book, mein, kampf, mostly, set, out, his, hatreds, he, only, admired, ordinary, german, world, war, i, soldiers, and, britain, which, he, saw, as, an, ally, against, communism, in, 1935, hermann, g, ring, welcomed, news, that, britain, as, a, potential, ally, was, rearming, in, 1936, he, promised, assistance, to, defend, the, british, empire, asking, only, a, free, hand, in, eastern, europe, and, repeated, this, to, lord, halifax, in, 1937, that, year, von, ribbentrop, met, churchill, with, a, similar, proposal, when, rebuffed, he, told, churchill, that, interference, with, german, domination, would, mean, war, to, hitler, s, great, annoyance, all, his, diplomacy, failed, to, stop, britain, from, declaring, war, when, he, invaded, poland, during, the, fall, of, france, he, repeatedly, discussed, peace, efforts, with, his, generals, when, churchill, came, to, power, there, was, still, wide, support, for, halifax, who, as, foreign, secretary, openly, argued, for, peace, negotiations, in, the, tradition, of, british, diplomacy, to, secure, british, independence, without, war, on, 20, may, halifax, secretly, requested, a, swedish, businessman, to, make, contact, with, g, ring, to, open, negotiations, shortly, afterwards, in, the, may, 1940, war, cabinet, crisis, halifax, argued, for, negotiations, involving, the, italians, but, this, was, rejected, by, churchill, with, majority, support, an, approach, made, through, the, swedish, ambassador, on, 22, june, was, reported, to, hitler, making, peace, negotiations, seem, feasible, throughout, july, as, the, battle, started, the, germans, made, wider, attempts, to, find, a, diplomatic, solution, on, 2, july, the, day, the, armed, forces, were, asked, to, start, preliminary, planning, for, an, invasion, hitler, got, von, ribbentrop, to, draft, a, speech, offering, peace, negotiations, on, 19, july, hitler, made, this, speech, to, the, german, parliament, in, berlin, appealing, to, reason, and, common, sense, and, said, he, could, see, no, reason, why, this, war, should, go, on, his, sombre, conclusion, was, received, in, silence, but, he, did, not, suggest, negotiations, and, this, was, perceived, as, being, effectively, an, ultimatum, by, the, british, government, which, rejected, the, offer, halifax, kept, trying, to, arrange, peace, until, he, was, sent, to, washington, in, december, as, ambassador, and, in, january, 1941, hitler, expressed, continued, interest, in, negotiating, peace, with, britain, a, may, 1939, planning, exercise, by, luftflotte, 3, found, that, the, luftwaffe, lacked, the, means, to, do, much, damage, to, britain, s, war, economy, beyond, laying, naval, mines, joseph, schmid, in, charge, of, luftwaffe, intelligence, presented, a, report, on, 22, november, 1939, stating, that, of, all, germany, s, possible, enemies, britain, is, the, most, dangerous, this, proposal, for, the, conduct, of, air, warfare, argued, for, a, counter, to, the, british, blockade, and, said, key, is, to, paralyse, the, british, trade, instead, of, the, wehrmacht, attacking, the, french, the, luftwaffe, with, naval, assistance, was, to, block, imports, to, britain, and, attack, seaports, should, the, enemy, resort, to, terror, measures, for, example, to, attack, our, towns, in, western, germany, they, could, retaliate, by, bombing, industrial, centres, and, london, parts, of, this, appeared, on, 29, november, in, directive, no, 9, as, future, actions, once, the, coast, had, been, conquered, on, 24, may, 1940, directive, no, 13, authorised, attacks, on, the, blockade, targets, as, well, as, retaliation, for, raf, bombing, of, industrial, targets, in, the, ruhr, after, the, defeat, of, france, the, okw, felt, they, had, won, the, war, and, some, more, pressure, would, persuade, britain, to, give, in, on, 30, june, the, okw, chief, of, staff, alfred, jodl, issued, his, paper, setting, out, options, the, first, was, to, increase, attacks, on, shipping, economic, targets, and, the, raf, air, attacks, and, food, shortages, were, expected, to, break, morale, and, lead, to, capitulation, destruction, of, the, raf, was, the, first, priority, and, invasion, would, be, a, last, resort, g, ring, s, operational, directive, issued, the, same, day, ordered, the, destruction, of, the, raf, to, clear, the, way, for, attacks, cutting, off, seaborne, supplies, to, britain, it, made, no, mention, of, invasion, in, november, 1939, the, okw, reviewed, the, potential, for, an, air, and, seaborne, invasion, of, britain, the, kriegsmarine, was, faced, with, the, threat, the, royal, navy, s, larger, home, fleet, posed, to, a, crossing, of, the, english, channel, and, together, with, the, german, army, viewed, control, of, airspace, as, a, necessary, precondition, the, german, navy, thought, air, superiority, alone, was, insufficient, the, german, naval, staff, had, already, produced, a, study, in, 1939, on, the, possibility, of, an, invasion, of, britain, and, concluded, that, it, also, required, naval, superiority, the, luftwaffe, said, invasion, could, only, be, the, final, act, in, an, already, victorious, war, hitler, first, discussed, the, idea, of, an, invasion, at, a, 21, may, 1940, meeting, with, grand, admiral, erich, raeder, who, stressed, the, difficulties, and, his, own, preference, for, a, blockade, okw, chief, of, staff, jodl, s, 30, june, report, described, invasion, as, a, last, resort, once, the, british, economy, had, been, damaged, and, the, luftwaffe, had, full, air, superiority, on, 2, july, okw, requested, preliminary, plans, in, britain, churchill, described, the, great, invasion, scare, as, serving, a, very, useful, purpose, by, keeping, every, man, and, woman, tuned, to, a, high, pitch, of, readiness, historian, len, deighton, stated, that, on, 10, july, churchill, advised, the, war, cabinet, that, invasion, could, be, ignored, as, it, would, be, a, most, hazardous, and, suicidal, operation, on, 11, july, hitler, agreed, with, raeder, that, invasion, would, be, a, last, resort, and, the, luftwaffe, advised, that, gaining, air, superiority, would, take, 14, to, 28, days, hitler, met, his, army, chiefs, von, brauchitsch, and, halder, at, the, berchtesgaden, on, 13, july, where, they, presented, detailed, plans, on, the, assumption, that, the, navy, would, provide, safe, transport, von, brauchitsch, and, halder, were, surprised, that, hitler, took, no, interest, in, the, invasion, plans, unlike, his, usual, attitude, toward, military, operations, but, on, 16, july, he, issued, directive, no, 16, ordering, preparations, for, operation, sea, lion, the, navy, insisted, on, a, narrow, beachhead, and, an, extended, period, for, landing, troops, the, army, rejected, these, plans, the, luftwaffe, could, begin, an, air, attack, in, august, hitler, held, a, meeting, of, his, army, and, navy, chiefs, on, 31, july, the, navy, said, 22, september, was, the, earliest, possible, date, and, proposed, postponement, until, the, following, year, but, hitler, preferred, september, he, then, told, von, brauchitsch, and, halder, that, he, would, decide, on, the, landing, operation, eight, to, fourteen, days, after, the, air, attack, began, on, 1, august, he, issued, directive, no, 17, for, intensified, air, and, sea, warfare, to, begin, with, adlertag, on, or, after, 5, august, subject, to, weather, keeping, options, open, for, negotiated, peace, or, blockade, and, siege, under, the, continuing, influence, of, the, 1935, conduct, of, the, air, war, doctrine, the, main, focus, of, the, luftwaffe, command, including, g, ring, was, in, concentrating, attacks, to, destroy, enemy, armed, forces, on, the, battlefield, and, blitzkrieg, close, air, support, of, the, army, succeeded, brilliantly, they, reserved, strategic, bombing, for, a, stalemate, situation, or, revenge, attacks, but, doubted, if, this, could, be, decisive, on, its, own, and, regarded, bombing, civilians, to, destroy, homes, or, undermine, morale, as, a, waste, of, strategic, effort, the, defeat, of, france, in, june, 1940, introduced, the, prospect, for, the, first, time, of, independent, air, action, against, britain, a, july, fliegercorps, i, paper, asserted, that, germany, was, by, definition, an, air, power, its, chief, weapon, against, england, is, the, air, force, then, the, navy, followed, by, the, landing, forces, and, the, army, in, 1940, the, luftwaffe, would, undertake, a, strategic, offensive, on, its, own, and, independent, of, the, other, services, according, to, an, april, 1944, german, account, of, their, military, mission, g, ring, was, convinced, that, strategic, bombing, could, win, objectives, that, were, beyond, the, army, and, navy, and, gain, political, advantages, in, the, third, reich, for, the, luftwaffe, and, himself, he, expected, air, warfare, to, decisively, force, britain, to, negotiate, as, all, in, the, okw, hoped, and, the, luftwaffe, took, little, interest, in, planning, to, support, an, invasion, the, luftwaffe, faced, a, more, capable, opponent, than, any, it, had, previously, met, a, sizeable, highly, coordinated, well, supplied, modern, air, force, the, luftwaffe, s, messerschmitt, bf, 109e, and, bf, 110c, fought, against, the, raf, s, workhorse, hurricane, mk, i, and, the, less, numerous, spitfire, mk, i, hurricanes, outnumbered, spitfires, in, raf, fighter, command, by, about, 2, 1, when, war, broke, out, the, bf, 109e, had, a, better, climb, rate, and, was, up, to, 40, mph, faster, in, level, flight, than, the, rotol, constant, speed, propeller, equipped, hurricane, mk, i, depending, on, altitude, the, speed, and, climb, disparity, with, the, original, non, rotol, hurricane, was, even, greater, by, mid, 1940, all, raf, spitfire, and, hurricane, fighter, squadrons, converted, to, 100, octane, aviation, fuel, which, allowed, their, merlin, engines, to, generate, significantly, more, power, and, an, approximately, 30, mph, increase, in, speed, at, low, altitudes, through, the, use, of, an, emergency, boost, override, in, september, 1940, the, more, powerful, mk, iia, series, 1, hurricanes, started, entering, service, in, small, numbers, this, version, was, capable, of, a, maximum, speed, of, 342, mph, 550, km, h, some, 20, mph, more, than, the, original, non, rotol, mk, i, though, it, was, still, 15, to, 20, mph, slower, than, a, bf, 109, depending, on, altitude, the, performance, of, the, spitfire, over, dunkirk, came, as, a, surprise, to, the, jagdwaffe, although, the, german, pilots, retained, a, strong, belief, that, the, 109, was, the, superior, fighter, the, british, fighters, were, equipped, with, eight, browning, 303, 7, 7mm, machine, guns, while, most, bf, 109es, had, two, 20mm, cannons, supplemented, by, two, 7, 92mm, machine, guns, the, 20mm, cannons, were, much, more, effective, than, the, 303, during, the, battle, it, was, not, unknown, for, damaged, german, bombers, to, limp, home, with, up, to, two, hundred, 303, hits, at, some, altitudes, the, bf, 109, could, outclimb, the, british, fighter, it, could, also, engage, in, vertical, plane, negative, g, manoeuvres, without, the, engine, cutting, out, because, its, db, 601, engine, used, fuel, injection, this, allowed, the, 109, to, dive, away, from, attackers, more, readily, than, the, carburettor, equipped, merlin, on, the, other, hand, the, bf, 109e, had, a, much, larger, turning, circle, than, its, two, foes, in, general, though, as, alfred, price, noted, in, the, spitfire, story, the, differences, between, the, spitfire, and, the, me, 109, in, performance, and, handling, were, only, marginal, and, in, a, combat, they, were, almost, always, surmounted, by, tactical, considerations, of, which, side, had, seen, the, other, first, which, had, the, advantage, of, sun, altitude, numbers, pilot, ability, tactical, situation, tactical, co, ordination, amount, of, fuel, remaining, etc, the, bf, 109e, was, also, used, as, a, jabo, jagdbomber, fighter, bomber, the, e, 4, b, and, e, 7, models, could, carry, a, 250, kg, bomb, underneath, the, fuselage, the, later, model, arriving, during, the, battle, the, bf, 109, unlike, the, stuka, could, fight, on, equal, terms, with, raf, fighters, after, releasing, its, ordnance, at, the, start, of, the, battle, the, twin, engined, messerschmitt, bf, 110c, long, range, zerst, rer, destroyer, was, also, expected, to, engage, in, air, to, air, combat, while, escorting, the, luftwaffe, bomber, fleet, although, the, 110, was, faster, than, the, hurricane, and, almost, as, fast, as, the, spitfire, its, lack, of, manoeuvrability, and, acceleration, meant, that, it, was, a, failure, as, a, long, range, escort, fighter, on, 13, and, 15, august, thirteen, and, thirty, aircraft, were, lost, the, equivalent, of, an, entire, gruppe, and, the, type, s, worst, losses, during, the, campaign, this, trend, continued, with, a, further, eight, and, fifteen, lost, on, 16, and, 17, august, the, most, successful, role, of, the, bf, 110, during, the, battle, was, as, a, schnellbomber, fast, bomber, the, bf, 110, usually, used, a, shallow, dive, to, bomb, the, target, and, escape, at, high, speed, one, unit, erprobungsgruppe, 210, initially, formed, as, the, service, test, unit, erprobungskommando, for, the, emerging, successor, to, the, 110, the, me, 210, proved, that, the, bf, 110, could, still, be, used, to, good, effect, in, attacking, small, or, pinpoint, targets, the, raf, s, boulton, paul, defiant, had, some, initial, success, over, dunkirk, because, of, its, resemblance, to, the, hurricane, luftwaffe, fighters, attacking, from, the, rear, were, surprised, by, its, unusual, gun, turret, during, the, battle, of, britain, it, proved, hopelessly, outclassed, for, various, reasons, the, defiant, lacked, any, form, of, forward, firing, armament, and, the, heavy, turret, and, second, crewman, meant, it, could, not, outrun, or, outmanoeuvre, either, the, bf, 109, or, bf, 110, by, the, end, of, august, after, disastrous, losses, the, aircraft, was, withdrawn, from, daylight, service, the, luftwaffe, s, primary, bombers, were, the, heinkel, he, 111, dornier, do, 17, and, junkers, ju, 88, for, level, bombing, at, medium, to, high, altitudes, and, the, junkers, ju, 87, stuka, for, dive, bombing, tactics, the, he, 111, was, used, in, greater, numbers, than, the, others, during, the, conflict, and, was, better, known, partly, due, to, its, distinctive, wing, shape, each, level, bomber, also, had, a, few, reconnaissance, versions, accompanying, them, that, were, used, during, the, battle, although, it, had, been, successful, in, previous, luftwaffe, engagements, the, stuka, suffered, heavy, losses, in, the, battle, of, britain, particularly, on, 18, august, due, to, its, slow, speed, and, vulnerability, to, fighter, interception, after, dive, bombing, a, target, as, the, losses, went, up, along, with, their, limited, payload, and, range, stuka, units, were, largely, removed, from, operations, over, england, and, diverted, to, concentrate, on, shipping, instead, until, they, were, eventually, re, deployed, to, the, eastern, front, in, 1941, for, some, raids, they, were, called, back, such, as, on, 13, september, to, attack, tangmere, airfield, the, remaining, three, bomber, types, differed, in, their, capabilities, the, dornier, do, 17, was, the, slowest, and, had, the, smallest, bomb, load, the, ju, 88, was, the, fastest, once, its, mainly, external, bomb, load, was, dropped, and, the, he, 111, had, the, largest, internal, bomb, load, all, three, bomber, types, suffered, heavy, losses, from, the, home, based, british, fighters, but, the, ju, 88, had, significantly, lower, loss, rates, due, to, its, greater, speed, and, its, ability, to, dive, out, of, trouble, it, was, originally, designed, as, a, dive, bomber, the, german, bombers, required, constant, protection, by, the, luftwaffe, s, fighter, force, german, escorts, were, not, sufficiently, numerous, bf, 109es, were, ordered, to, support, more, than, 300, 400, bombers, on, any, given, day, later, in, the, conflict, when, night, bombing, became, more, frequent, all, three, were, used, due, to, its, smaller, bomb, load, the, lighter, do, 17, was, used, less, than, the, he, 111, and, ju, 88, for, this, purpose, on, the, british, side, three, bomber, types, were, mostly, used, on, night, operations, against, targets, such, as, factories, invasion, ports, and, railway, centres, the, armstrong, whitworth, whitley, the, handley, page, hampden, and, the, vickers, wellington, were, classified, as, heavy, bombers, by, the, raf, although, the, hampden, was, a, medium, bomber, comparable, to, the, he, 111, the, twin, engined, bristol, blenheim, and, the, obsolescent, single, engined, fairey, battle, were, both, light, bombers, the, blenheim, was, the, most, numerous, of, the, aircraft, equipping, raf, bomber, command, and, was, used, in, attacks, against, shipping, ports, airfields, and, factories, on, the, continent, by, day, and, by, night, the, fairey, battle, squadrons, which, had, suffered, heavy, losses, in, daylight, attacks, during, the, battle, of, france, were, brought, up, to, strength, with, reserve, aircraft, and, continued, to, operate, at, night, in, attacks, against, the, invasion, ports, until, the, battle, was, withdrawn, from, uk, front, line, service, in, october, 1940, before, the, war, the, raf, s, processes, for, selecting, potential, candidates, were, opened, to, men, of, all, social, classes, through, the, creation, in, 1936, of, the, raf, volunteer, reserve, which, was, designed, to, appeal, to, young, men, without, any, class, distinctions, the, older, squadrons, of, the, royal, auxiliary, air, force, did, retain, some, of, their, upper, class, exclusiveness, but, their, numbers, were, soon, swamped, by, the, newcomers, of, the, rafvr, by, 1, september, 1939, 6, 646, pilots, had, been, trained, through, the, rafvr, by, mid, 1940, there, were, about, 9, 000, pilots, in, the, raf, to, man, about, 5, 000, aircraft, most, of, which, were, bombers, fighter, command, was, never, short, of, pilots, but, the, problem, of, finding, sufficient, numbers, of, fully, trained, fighter, pilots, became, acute, by, mid, august, 1940, with, aircraft, production, running, at, 300, planes, each, week, only, 200, pilots, were, trained, in, the, same, period, in, addition, more, pilots, were, allocated, to, squadrons, than, there, were, aircraft, as, this, allowed, squadrons, to, maintain, operational, strength, despite, casualties, and, still, provide, for, pilot, leave, another, factor, was, that, only, about, 30, of, the, 9, 000, pilots, were, assigned, to, operational, squadrons, 20, of, the, pilots, were, involved, in, conducting, pilot, training, and, a, further, 20, were, undergoing, further, instruction, like, those, offered, in, canada, and, in, southern, rhodesia, to, the, commonwealth, trainees, although, already, qualified, the, rest, were, assigned, to, staff, positions, since, raf, policy, dictated, that, only, pilots, could, make, many, staff, and, operational, command, decisions, even, in, engineering, matters, at, the, height, of, the, fighting, and, despite, churchill, s, insistence, only, 30, pilots, were, released, to, the, front, line, from, administrative, duties, for, these, reasons, and, the, permanent, loss, of, 435, pilots, during, the, battle, of, france, alone, along, with, many, more, wounded, and, others, lost, in, norway, the, raf, had, fewer, experienced, pilots, at, the, start, of, the, battle, of, britain, than, the, luftwaffe, it, was, the, lack, of, trained, pilots, in, the, fighting, squadrons, rather, than, the, lack, of, aircraft, that, became, the, greatest, concern, for, air, chief, marshal, hugh, dowding, commander, of, fighter, command, drawing, from, regular, raf, forces, the, auxiliary, air, force, and, the, volunteer, reserve, the, british, were, able, to, muster, some, 1, 103, fighter, pilots, on, 1, july, replacement, pilots, with, little, flight, training, and, often, no, gunnery, training, suffered, high, casualty, rates, thus, exacerbating, the, problem, the, luftwaffe, on, the, other, hand, were, able, to, muster, a, large, number, 1, 450, of, experienced, fighter, pilots, drawing, from, a, cadre, of, spanish, civil, war, veterans, these, pilots, already, had, comprehensive, courses, in, aerial, gunnery, and, instructions, in, tactics, suited, for, fighter, versus, fighter, combat, training, manuals, discouraged, heroism, stressing, the, importance, of, attacking, only, when, the, odds, were, in, the, pilot, s, favour, despite, the, high, levels, of, experience, german, fighter, formations, did, not, provide, a, sufficient, reserve, of, pilots, to, allow, for, losses, and, leave, and, the, luftwaffe, was, unable, to, produce, enough, pilots, to, prevent, a, decline, in, operational, strength, as, the, battle, progressed, about, 20, of, pilots, who, took, part, in, the, battle, were, from, non, british, countries, the, royal, air, force, roll, of, honour, for, the, battle, of, britain, recognises, 595, non, british, pilots, out, of, 2, 936, as, flying, at, least, one, authorised, operational, sortie, with, an, eligible, unit, of, the, raf, or, fleet, air, arm, between, 10, july, and, 31, october, 1940, these, included, 145, poles, 127, new, zealanders, 112, canadians, 88, czechoslovaks, 10, irish, 32, australians, 28, belgians, 25, south, africans, 13, french, 9, americans, 3, southern, rhodesians, and, individuals, from, jamaica, barbados, and, newfoundland, altogether, in, the, fighter, battles, the, bombing, raids, and, the, various, patrols, flown, between, 10, july, and, 31, october, 1940, by, the, royal, air, force, 1495, aircrew, were, killed, of, whom, 449, were, fighter, pilots, 718, aircrew, from, bomber, command, and, 280, from, coastal, command, among, those, killed, were, 47, airmen, from, canada, 24, from, australia, 17, from, south, africa, 30, from, poland, 20, from, czechoslovakia, and, six, from, belgium, forty, seven, new, zealanders, lost, their, lives, including, 15, fighter, pilots, 24, bomber, and, eight, coastal, aircrew, the, names, of, these, allied, and, commonwealth, airmen, are, inscribed, in, a, memorial, book, that, rests, in, the, battle, of, britain, chapel, in, westminster, abbey, in, the, chapel, is, a, stained, glass, window, which, contains, the, badges, of, the, fighter, squadrons, which, operated, during, the, battle, and, the, flags, of, the, nations, to, which, the, pilots, and, aircrew, belonged, these, pilots, some, of, whom, had, to, flee, their, home, countries, because, of, german, invasions, fought, with, distinction, the, no, 303, polish, fighter, squadron, was, the, highest, scoring, fighter, squadron, of, the, battle, of, britain, even, though, it, joined, the, fray, two, months, after, the, battle, had, begun, had, it, not, been, for, the, magnificent, material, contributed, by, the, polish, squadrons, and, their, unsurpassed, gallantry, wrote, air, chief, marshal, hugh, dowding, head, of, raf, fighter, command, i, hesitate, to, say, that, the, outcome, of, the, battle, would, have, been, the, same, at, the, urging, of, italian, dictator, benito, mussolini, an, element, of, the, italian, royal, air, force, regia, aeronautica, called, the, italian, air, corps, corpo, aereo, italiano, or, cai, took, part, in, the, later, stages, of, the, battle, of, britain, it, first, saw, action, on, 24, october, 1940, when, a, force, of, fiat, br, 20, medium, bombers, attacked, the, port, at, harwich, the, cai, achieved, limited, success, during, this, and, subsequent, raids, the, unit, was, redeployed, in, january, 1941, having, claimed, to, have, shot, down, at, least, nine, british, aircraft, this, was, inaccurate, and, their, actual, successes, were, much, lower, the, indecision, of, okl, over, what, to, do, was, reflected, in, shifts, in, luftwaffe, strategy, the, doctrine, of, concentrated, close, air, support, of, the, army, at, the, battlefront, succeeded, against, poland, denmark, and, norway, the, low, countries, and, france, but, incurred, significant, losses, the, luftwaffe, had, to, build, or, repair, bases, in, the, conquered, territories, and, rebuild, their, strength, in, june, 1940, they, began, regular, armed, reconnaissance, flights, and, sporadic, st, rangriffe, nuisance, raids, of, one, or, a, few, bombers, by, day, and, night, these, gave, crews, practice, in, navigation, and, avoiding, air, defences, and, set, off, air, raid, alarms, which, disturbed, civilian, morale, similar, nuisance, raids, continued, throughout, the, battle, into, late, 1940, scattered, naval, mine, laying, sorties, began, at, the, outset, and, increased, gradually, over, the, battle, period, g, ring, s, operational, directive, of, 30, june, ordered, the, destruction, of, the, raf, including, the, aircraft, industry, to, end, raf, bombing, raids, on, germany, and, facilitating, attacks, on, ports, and, storage, in, the, luftwaffe, blockade, of, britain, attacks, on, channel, shipping, in, the, kanalkampf, began, on, 4, july, and, were, formalised, on, 11, july, in, an, order, by, hans, jeschonnek, which, added, the, arms, industry, as, a, target, on, 16, july, directive, no, 16, ordered, preparations, for, operation, sea, lion, and, on, the, next, day, the, luftwaffe, was, ordered, to, stand, by, in, full, readiness, g, ring, met, his, air, fleet, commanders, and, on, 24, july, issued, orders, for, gaining, air, supremacy, protecting, the, army, and, navy, if, the, invasion, went, ahead, and, attacking, royal, navy, ships, and, continuing, the, blockade, once, the, raf, had, been, defeated, luftwaffe, bombers, were, to, move, forward, beyond, london, without, the, need, for, fighter, escort, destroying, military, and, economic, targets, at, a, meeting, on, 1, august, the, command, reviewed, plans, produced, by, each, fliegerkorps, with, differing, proposals, for, targets, including, whether, to, bomb, airfields, but, failed, to, decide, a, priority, intelligence, reports, gave, g, ring, the, impression, that, the, raf, was, almost, defeated, raids, would, attract, british, fighters, for, the, luftwaffe, to, shoot, down, on, 6, august, he, finalised, plans, for, adlertag, eagle, day, with, kesselring, sperrle, and, stumpff, the, destruction, of, raf, fighter, command, in, the, south, of, england, was, to, take, four, days, with, lightly, escorted, small, bomber, raids, leaving, the, main, fighter, force, free, to, attack, raf, fighters, bombing, of, military, and, economic, targets, was, then, to, systematically, extend, up, to, the, midlands, until, daylight, attacks, could, proceed, unhindered, over, the, whole, of, britain, bombing, of, london, was, to, be, held, back, while, these, night, time, destroyer, attacks, proceeded, over, other, urban, areas, then, in, the, culmination, of, the, campaign, a, major, attack, on, the, capital, was, intended, to, cause, a, crisis, with, refugees, fleeing, london, just, as, operation, sea, lion, was, to, begin, with, hopes, fading, for, the, possibility, of, invasion, on, 4, september, hitler, authorised, a, main, focus, on, day, and, night, attacks, on, tactical, targets, with, london, as, the, main, target, which, became, known, as, the, blitz, with, increasing, difficulty, in, defending, bombers, in, day, raids, the, luftwaffe, shifted, to, a, strategic, bombing, campaign, of, night, raids, aiming, to, overcome, british, resistance, by, damaging, infrastructure, and, food, stocks, though, intentional, terror, bombing, of, civilians, was, not, sanctioned, the, luftwaffe, regrouped, after, the, battle, of, france, into, three, luftflotten, air, fleets, opposite, britain, s, southern, and, eastern, coasts, luftflotte, 2, generalfeldmarschall, albert, kesselring, was, responsible, for, the, bombing, of, south, east, england, and, the, london, area, luftflotte, 3, generalfeldmarschall, hugo, sperrle, concentrated, on, the, west, country, wales, the, midlands, and, north, west, england, luftflotte, 5, generaloberst, hans, j, rgen, stumpff, from, his, headquarters, in, norway, attacked, the, north, of, england, and, scotland, as, the, battle, progressed, command, responsibility, shifted, with, luftflotte, 3, taking, more, responsibility, for, the, night, bombing, and, the, main, daylight, operations, fell, upon, luftflotte, 2, initial, luftwaffe, estimates, were, that, it, would, take, four, days, to, defeat, raf, fighter, command, in, southern, england, this, would, be, followed, by, a, four, week, offensive, during, which, the, bombers, and, long, range, fighters, would, destroy, all, military, installations, throughout, the, country, and, wreck, the, british, aircraft, industry, the, campaign, was, planned, to, begin, with, attacks, on, airfields, near, the, coast, gradually, moving, inland, to, attack, the, ring, of, sector, airfields, defending, london, later, reassessments, gave, the, luftwaffe, five, weeks, from, 8, august, to, 15, september, to, establish, temporary, air, superiority, over, england, fighter, command, had, to, be, destroyed, either, on, the, ground, or, in, the, air, yet, the, luftwaffe, had, to, preserve, its, strength, to, be, able, to, support, the, invasion, the, luftwaffe, had, to, maintain, a, high, kill, ratio, over, the, raf, fighters, the, only, alternative, to, the, goal, of, air, superiority, was, a, terror, bombing, campaign, aimed, at, the, civilian, population, but, this, was, considered, a, last, resort, and, it, was, forbidden, by, hitler, the, luftwaffe, kept, broadly, to, this, scheme, but, its, commanders, had, differences, of, opinion, on, strategy, sperrle, wanted, to, eradicate, the, air, defence, infrastructure, by, bombing, it, kesselring, championed, attacking, london, directly, either, to, bombard, the, british, government, into, submission, or, to, draw, raf, fighters, into, a, decisive, battle, g, ring, did, nothing, to, resolve, this, disagreement, between, his, commanders, and, gave, only, vague, directives, during, the, initial, stages, of, the, battle, g, ring, seemingly, unable, to, decide, upon, which, strategy, to, pursue, luftwaffe, formations, employed, a, loose, section, of, two, called, rotte, based, on, a, leader, rottenf, hrer, followed, at, a, distance, of, about, 200, m, 220, yd, by, his, wingman, rottenhund, pack, dog, or, katschmarek, the, turning, radius, of, a, bf, 109, enabling, both, aircraft, to, turn, together, at, high, speed, the, katschmarek, flew, slightly, higher, and, was, trained, always, to, stay, with, his, leader, with, more, room, between, them, both, could, spend, less, time, maintaining, formation, and, more, time, looking, around, and, covering, each, other, s, blind, spots, attacking, aircraft, could, be, sandwiched, between, the, two, 109s, the, formation, was, developed, from, principles, formulated, by, the, first, world, war, ace, oswald, boelcke, in, 1916, in, 1934, the, finnish, air, force, adopted, similar, formations, called, partio, patrol, two, aircraft, and, parvi, two, patrols, four, aircraft, for, similar, reasons, though, luftwaffe, pilots, during, the, spanish, civil, war, led, by, g, nther, l, tzow, and, werner, m, lders, among, others, are, generally, given, credit, the, rotte, allowed, the, rottenf, hrer, to, concentrate, on, shooting, down, aircraft, but, few, wingmen, had, the, chance, leading, to, some, resentment, in, the, lower, ranks, where, it, was, felt, that, the, high, scores, came, at, their, expense, two, rotten, combined, as, a, schwarm, where, all, the, pilots, could, watch, what, was, happening, around, them, each, schwarm, in, a, staffel, flew, at, staggered, heights, and, with, about, 200, m, 220, yd, between, them, making, the, formation, difficult, to, spot, at, longer, ranges, and, allowing, for, a, great, deal, of, flexibility, by, using, a, tight, cross, over, turn, a, schwarm, could, quickly, change, direction, the, bf, 110s, adopted, the, same, schwarm, formation, as, the, 109s, but, were, seldom, able, to, use, this, to, the, same, advantage, the, bf, 110, s, most, successful, method, of, attack, was, the, bounce, from, above, when, attacked, zerst, rergruppen, increasingly, resorted, to, forming, large, defensive, circles, where, each, bf, 110, guarded, the, tail, of, the, aircraft, ahead, of, it, g, ring, ordered, that, they, be, renamed, offensive, circles, in, a, vain, bid, to, improve, rapidly, declining, morale, these, conspicuous, formations, were, often, successful, in, attracting, raf, fighters, that, were, sometimes, bounced, by, high, flying, bf, 109s, this, led, to, the, often, repeated, misconception, that, the, bf, 110s, were, escorted, by, bf, 109s, luftwaffe, tactics, were, influenced, by, their, fighters, the, bf, 110, proved, too, vulnerable, against, the, nimble, single, engined, raf, fighters, and, the, bulk, of, fighter, escort, duties, devolved, to, the, bf, 109, fighter, tactics, were, then, complicated, by, bomber, crews, who, demanded, closer, protection, after, the, hard, fought, battles, of, 15, and, 18, august, g, ring, met, his, unit, leaders, the, need, for, the, fighters, to, meet, up, on, time, with, the, bombers, was, stressed, it, was, also, decided, that, one, bomber, gruppe, could, only, be, properly, protected, by, several, gruppen, of, 109s, g, ring, stipulated, that, as, many, fighters, as, possible, were, to, be, left, free, for, freie, jagd, free, hunts, a, free, roving, fighter, sweep, preceded, a, raid, to, try, to, sweep, defenders, out, of, the, raid, s, path, the, ju, 87, units, which, had, suffered, heavy, casualties, were, only, to, be, used, under, favourable, circumstances, in, early, september, due, to, increasing, complaints, from, the, bomber, crews, about, raf, fighters, seemingly, able, to, get, through, the, escort, screen, g, ring, ordered, an, increase, in, close, escort, duties, this, decision, shackled, many, of, the, bf, 109s, to, the, bombers, and, although, they, were, more, successful, at, protecting, the, bombers, casualties, amongst, the, fighters, mounted, primarily, because, they, were, forced, to, fly, and, manoeuvre, at, reduced, speeds, the, luftwaffe, varied, its, tactics, to, break, fighter, command, it, launched, many, freie, jagd, to, draw, up, raf, fighters, raf, fighter, controllers, were, often, able, to, detect, these, and, position, squadrons, to, avoid, them, keeping, to, dowding, s, plan, to, preserve, fighter, strength, for, the, bomber, formations, the, luftwaffe, also, tried, using, small, formations, of, bombers, as, bait, covering, them, with, large, numbers, of, escorts, this, was, more, successful, but, escort, duty, kept, the, fighters, tied, to, the, slower, bombers, making, them, more, vulnerable, by, september, standard, tactics, for, raids, had, become, an, amalgam, of, techniques, a, freie, jagd, would, precede, the, main, attack, formations, the, bombers, would, fly, in, at, altitudes, between, 5, 000, and, 6, 000, m, 16, 000, and, 20, 000, ft, closely, escorted, by, fighters, escorts, were, divided, into, two, parts, usually, gruppen, some, operating, close, to, the, bombers, and, others, a, few, hundred, yards, away, and, a, little, above, if, the, formation, was, attacked, from, the, starboard, the, starboard, section, engaged, the, attackers, the, top, section, moving, to, starboard, and, the, port, section, to, the, top, position, if, the, attack, came, from, the, port, side, the, system, was, reversed, british, fighters, coming, from, the, rear, were, engaged, by, the, rear, section, and, the, two, outside, sections, similarly, moving, to, the, rear, if, the, threat, came, from, above, the, top, section, went, into, action, while, the, side, sections, gained, height, to, be, able, to, follow, raf, fighters, down, as, they, broke, away, if, attacked, all, sections, flew, in, defensive, circles, these, tactics, were, skilfully, evolved, and, carried, out, and, were, difficult, to, counter, adolf, galland, noted, we, had, the, impression, that, whatever, we, did, we, were, bound, to, be, wrong, fighter, protection, for, bombers, created, many, problems, which, had, to, be, solved, in, action, bomber, pilots, preferred, close, screening, in, which, their, formation, was, surrounded, by, pairs, of, fighters, pursuing, a, zigzag, course, obviously, the, visible, presence, of, the, protective, fighters, gave, the, bomber, pilots, a, greater, sense, of, security, however, this, was, a, faulty, conclusion, because, a, fighter, can, only, carry, out, this, purely, defensive, task, by, taking, the, initiative, in, the, offensive, he, must, never, wait, until, attacked, because, he, then, loses, the, chance, of, acting, we, fighter, pilots, certainly, preferred, the, free, chase, during, the, approach, and, over, the, target, area, this, gives, the, greatest, relief, and, the, best, protection, for, the, bomber, force, the, biggest, disadvantage, faced, by, bf, 109, pilots, was, that, without, the, benefit, of, long, range, drop, tanks, which, were, introduced, in, limited, numbers, in, the, late, stages, of, the, battle, usually, of, 300, l, 66, imp, gal, 79, us, gal, capacity, the, 109s, had, an, endurance, of, just, over, an, hour, and, for, the, 109e, a, 600, km, 370, mi, range, once, over, britain, a, 109, pilot, had, to, keep, an, eye, on, a, red, low, fuel, light, on, the, instrument, panel, once, this, was, illuminated, he, was, forced, to, turn, back, and, head, for, france, with, the, prospect, of, two, long, flights, over, water, and, knowing, their, range, was, substantially, reduced, when, escorting, bombers, or, during, combat, the, jagdflieger, coined, the, term, kanalkrankheit, or, channel, sickness, the, luftwaffe, was, ill, served, by, its, lack, of, military, intelligence, about, the, british, defences, the, german, intelligence, services, were, fractured, and, plagued, by, rivalry, their, performance, was, amateurish, by, 1940, there, were, few, german, agents, operating, in, great, britain, and, a, handful, of, bungled, attempts, to, insert, spies, into, the, country, were, foiled, as, a, result, of, intercepted, radio, transmissions, the, germans, began, to, realise, that, the, raf, fighters, were, being, controlled, from, ground, facilities, in, july, and, august, 1939, for, example, the, airship, graf, zeppelin, which, was, packed, with, equipment, for, listening, in, on, raf, radio, and, rdf, transmissions, flew, around, the, coasts, of, britain, although, the, luftwaffe, correctly, interpreted, these, new, ground, control, procedures, they, were, incorrectly, assessed, as, being, rigid, and, ineffectual, a, british, radar, system, was, well, known, to, the, luftwaffe, from, intelligence, gathered, before, the, war, but, the, highly, developed, dowding, system, linked, with, fighter, control, had, been, a, well, kept, secret, even, when, good, information, existed, such, as, a, november, 1939, abwehr, assessment, of, fighter, command, strengths, and, capabilities, by, abteilung, v, it, was, ignored, if, it, did, not, match, conventional, preconceptions, on, 16, july, 1940, abteilung, v, commanded, by, oberstleutnant, beppo, schmid, produced, a, report, on, the, raf, and, on, britain, s, defensive, capabilities, which, was, adopted, by, the, frontline, commanders, as, a, basis, for, their, operational, plans, one, of, the, most, conspicuous, failures, of, the, report, was, the, lack, of, information, on, the, raf, s, rdf, network, and, control, systems, capabilities, it, was, assumed, that, the, system, was, rigid, and, inflexible, with, the, raf, fighters, being, tied, to, their, home, bases, an, optimistic, and, as, it, turned, out, erroneous, conclusion, reached, was, d, supply, situation, at, present, the, british, aircraft, industry, produces, about, 180, to, 300, first, line, fighters, and, 140, first, line, bombers, a, month, in, view, of, the, present, conditions, relating, to, production, the, appearance, of, raw, material, difficulties, the, disruption, or, breakdown, of, production, at, factories, owing, to, air, attacks, the, increased, vulnerability, to, air, attack, owing, to, the, fundamental, reorganisation, of, the, aircraft, industry, now, in, progress, it, is, believed, that, for, the, time, being, output, will, decrease, rather, than, increase, in, the, event, of, an, intensification, of, air, warfare, it, is, expected, that, the, present, strength, of, the, raf, will, fall, and, this, decline, will, be, aggravated, by, the, continued, decrease, in, production, because, of, this, statement, reinforced, by, another, more, detailed, report, issued, on, 10, august, there, was, a, mindset, in, the, ranks, of, the, luftwaffe, that, the, raf, would, run, out, of, frontline, fighters, the, luftwaffe, believed, it, was, weakening, fighter, command, at, three, times, the, actual, attrition, rate, many, times, the, leadership, believed, fighter, command, s, strength, had, collapsed, only, to, discover, that, the, raf, were, able, to, send, up, defensive, formations, at, will, throughout, the, battle, the, luftwaffe, had, to, use, numerous, reconnaissance, sorties, to, make, up, for, the, poor, intelligence, reconnaissance, aircraft, initially, mostly, dornier, do, 17s, but, increasingly, bf, 110s, proved, easy, prey, for, british, fighters, as, it, was, seldom, possible, for, them, to, be, escorted, by, bf, 109s, thus, the, luftwaffe, operated, blind, for, much, of, the, battle, unsure, of, its, enemy, s, true, strengths, capabilities, and, deployments, many, of, the, fighter, command, airfields, were, never, attacked, while, raids, against, supposed, fighter, airfields, fell, instead, on, bomber, or, coastal, defence, stations, the, results, of, bombing, and, air, fighting, were, consistently, exaggerated, due, to, inaccurate, claims, over, enthusiastic, reports, and, the, difficulty, of, confirmation, over, enemy, territory, in, the, euphoric, atmosphere, of, perceived, victory, the, luftwaffe, leadership, became, increasingly, disconnected, from, reality, this, lack, of, leadership, and, solid, intelligence, meant, the, germans, did, not, adopt, a, consistent, strategy, even, when, the, raf, had, its, back, to, the, wall, moreover, there, was, never, a, systematic, focus, on, one, type, of, target, such, as, airbases, radar, stations, or, aircraft, factories, consequently, the, already, haphazard, effort, was, further, diluted, while, the, british, were, using, radar, for, air, defence, more, effectively, than, the, germans, realised, the, luftwaffe, attempted, to, press, its, own, offensive, with, advanced, radio, navigation, systems, of, which, the, british, were, initially, not, aware, one, of, these, was, knickebein, bent, leg, this, system, was, used, at, night, and, for, raids, where, precision, was, required, it, was, rarely, used, during, the, battle, of, britain, the, luftwaffe, was, much, better, prepared, for, the, task, of, air, sea, rescue, than, the, raf, specifically, tasking, the, seenotdienst, unit, equipped, with, about, 30, heinkel, he, 59, floatplanes, with, picking, up, downed, aircrew, from, the, north, sea, english, channel, and, the, dover, straits, in, addition, luftwaffe, aircraft, were, equipped, with, life, rafts, and, the, aircrew, were, provided, with, sachets, of, a, chemical, called, fluorescein, which, on, reacting, with, water, created, a, large, easy, to, see, bright, green, patch, in, accordance, with, the, geneva, convention, the, he, 59s, were, unarmed, and, painted, white, with, civilian, registration, markings, and, red, crosses, nevertheless, raf, aircraft, attacked, these, aircraft, as, some, were, escorted, by, bf, 109s, after, single, he, 59s, were, forced, to, land, on, the, sea, by, raf, fighters, on, 1, and, 9, july, respectively, a, controversial, order, was, issued, to, the, raf, on, 13, july, this, stated, that, from, 20, july, seenotdienst, aircraft, were, to, be, shot, down, one, of, the, reasons, given, by, churchill, was, we, did, not, recognise, this, means, of, rescuing, enemy, pilots, so, they, could, come, and, bomb, our, civil, population, again, all, german, air, ambulances, were, forced, down, or, shot, down, by, our, fighters, on, definite, orders, approved, by, the, war, cabinet, the, british, also, believed, that, their, crews, would, report, on, convoys, the, air, ministry, issuing, a, communiqu, to, the, german, government, on, 14, july, that, britain, was, unable, however, to, grant, immunity, to, such, aircraft, flying, over, areas, in, which, operations, are, in, progress, on, land, or, at, sea, or, approaching, british, or, allied, territory, or, territory, in, british, occupation, or, british, or, allied, ships, ambulance, aircraft, which, do, not, comply, with, the, above, will, do, so, at, their, own, risk, and, peril, the, white, he, 59s, were, soon, repainted, in, camouflage, colours, and, armed, with, defensive, machine, guns, although, another, four, he, 59s, were, shot, down, by, raf, aircraft, the, seenotdienst, continued, to, pick, up, downed, luftwaffe, and, allied, aircrew, throughout, the, battle, earning, praise, from, adolf, galland, for, their, bravery, during, early, tests, of, the, chain, home, system, the, slow, flow, of, information, from, the, ch, radars, and, observers, to, the, aircraft, often, caused, them, to, miss, their, bandits, the, solution, today, known, as, the, dowding, system, was, to, create, a, set, of, reporting, chains, to, move, information, from, the, various, observation, points, to, the, pilots, in, their, fighters, it, was, named, after, its, chief, architect, stuffy, dowding, reports, from, ch, radars, and, the, observer, corps, were, sent, directly, to, fighter, command, headquarters, fchq, at, bentley, priory, where, they, were, filtered, to, combine, multiple, reports, of, the, same, formations, into, single, tracks, telephone, operators, would, then, forward, only, the, information, of, interest, to, the, group, headquarters, where, the, map, would, be, re, created, this, process, was, repeated, to, produce, another, version, of, the, map, at, the, sector, level, covering, a, much, smaller, area, looking, over, their, maps, group, level, commanders, could, select, squadrons, to, attack, particular, targets, from, that, point, the, sector, operators, would, give, commands, to, the, fighters, to, arrange, an, interception, as, well, as, return, them, to, base, sector, stations, also, controlled, the, anti, aircraft, batteries, in, their, area, an, army, officer, sat, beside, each, fighter, controller, and, directed, the, gun, crews, when, to, open, and, cease, fire, the, dowding, system, dramatically, improved, the, speed, and, accuracy, of, the, information, that, flowed, to, the, pilots, during, the, early, war, period, it, was, expected, that, an, average, interception, mission, might, have, a, 30, chance, of, ever, seeing, their, target, during, the, battle, the, dowding, system, maintained, an, average, rate, over, 75, with, several, examples, of, 100, rates, every, fighter, dispatched, found, and, intercepted, its, target, in, contrast, luftwaffe, fighters, attempting, to, intercept, raids, had, to, randomly, seek, their, targets, and, often, returned, home, having, never, seen, enemy, aircraft, the, result, is, what, is, now, known, as, an, example, of, force, multiplication, raf, fighters, were, as, effective, as, two, or, more, luftwaffe, fighters, greatly, offsetting, or, overturning, the, disparity, in, actual, numbers, while, luftwaffe, intelligence, reports, underestimated, british, fighter, forces, and, aircraft, production, the, british, intelligence, estimates, went, the, other, way, they, overestimated, german, aircraft, production, numbers, and, range, of, aircraft, available, and, numbers, of, luftwaffe, pilots, in, action, the, luftwaffe, believed, from, their, pilot, claims, and, the, impression, given, by, aerial, reconnaissance, that, the, raf, was, close, to, defeat, and, the, british, made, strenuous, efforts, to, overcome, the, perceived, advantages, held, by, their, opponents, it, is, unclear, how, much, the, british, intercepts, of, the, enigma, cipher, used, for, high, security, german, radio, communications, affected, the, battle, ultra, the, information, obtained, from, enigma, intercepts, gave, the, highest, echelons, of, the, british, command, a, view, of, german, intentions, according, to, f, w, winterbotham, who, was, the, senior, air, staff, representative, in, the, secret, intelligence, service, ultra, helped, establish, the, strength, and, composition, of, the, luftwaffe, s, formations, the, aims, of, the, commanders, and, provided, early, warning, of, some, raids, in, early, august, it, was, decided, that, a, small, unit, would, be, set, up, at, fchq, which, would, process, the, flow, of, information, from, bletchley, and, provide, dowding, only, with, the, most, essential, ultra, material, thus, the, air, ministry, did, not, have, to, send, a, continual, flow, of, information, to, fchq, preserving, secrecy, and, dowding, was, not, inundated, with, non, essential, information, keith, park, and, his, controllers, were, also, told, about, ultra, in, a, further, attempt, to, camouflage, the, existence, of, ultra, dowding, created, a, unit, named, no, 421, reconnaissance, flight, raf, this, unit, which, later, became, no, 91, squadron, raf, was, equipped, with, hurricanes, and, spitfires, and, sent, out, aircraft, to, search, for, and, report, luftwaffe, formations, approaching, england, in, addition, the, radio, listening, service, known, as, y, service, monitoring, the, patterns, of, luftwaffe, radio, traffic, contributed, considerably, to, the, early, warning, of, raids, in, the, late, 1930s, fighter, command, expected, to, face, only, bombers, over, britain, not, single, engined, fighters, a, series, of, fighting, area, tactics, were, formulated, and, rigidly, adhered, to, involving, a, series, of, manoeuvres, designed, to, concentrate, a, squadron, s, firepower, to, bring, down, bombers, raf, fighters, flew, in, tight, v, shaped, sections, vics, of, three, aircraft, with, four, such, sections, in, tight, formation, only, the, squadron, leader, at, the, front, was, free, to, watch, for, the, enemy, the, other, pilots, had, to, concentrate, on, keeping, station, training, also, emphasised, by, the, book, attacks, by, sections, breaking, away, in, sequence, fighter, command, recognised, the, weaknesses, of, this, structure, early, in, the, battle, but, it, was, felt, too, risky, to, change, tactics, during, the, battle, because, replacement, pilots, often, with, only, minimal, flying, time, could, not, be, readily, retrained, and, inexperienced, pilots, needed, firm, leadership, in, the, air, only, rigid, formations, could, provide, german, pilots, dubbed, the, raf, formations, idiotenreihen, rows, of, idiots, because, they, left, squadrons, vulnerable, to, attack, front, line, raf, pilots, were, acutely, aware, of, the, inherent, deficiencies, of, their, own, tactics, a, compromise, was, adopted, whereby, squadron, formations, used, much, looser, formations, with, one, or, two, weavers, flying, independently, above, and, behind, to, provide, increased, observation, and, rear, protection, these, tended, to, be, the, least, experienced, men, and, were, often, the, first, to, be, shot, down, without, the, other, pilots, even, noticing, that, they, were, under, attack, during, the, battle, 74, squadron, under, squadron, leader, adolph, sailor, malan, adopted, a, variation, of, the, german, formation, called, the, fours, in, line, astern, which, was, a, vast, improvement, on, the, old, three, aircraft, vic, malan, s, formation, was, later, generally, used, by, fighter, command, the, weight, of, the, battle, fell, upon, 11, group, keith, park, s, tactics, were, to, dispatch, individual, squadrons, to, intercept, raids, the, intention, was, to, subject, incoming, bombers, to, continual, attacks, by, relatively, small, numbers, of, fighters, and, try, to, break, up, the, tight, german, formations, once, formations, had, fallen, apart, stragglers, could, be, picked, off, one, by, one, where, multiple, squadrons, reached, a, raid, the, procedure, was, for, the, slower, hurricanes, to, tackle, the, bombers, while, the, more, agile, spitfires, held, up, the, fighter, escort, this, ideal, was, not, always, achieved, resulting, in, occasions, when, spitfires, and, hurricanes, reversed, roles, park, also, issued, instructions, to, his, units, to, engage, in, frontal, attacks, against, the, bombers, which, were, more, vulnerable, to, such, attacks, again, in, the, environment, of, fast, moving, three, dimensional, air, battles, few, raf, fighter, units, were, able, to, attack, the, bombers, from, head, on, during, the, battle, some, commanders, notably, leigh, mallory, proposed, squadrons, be, formed, into, big, wings, consisting, of, at, least, three, squadrons, to, attack, the, enemy, en, masse, a, method, pioneered, by, douglas, bader, proponents, of, this, tactic, claimed, interceptions, in, large, numbers, caused, greater, enemy, losses, while, reducing, their, own, casualties, opponents, pointed, out, the, big, wings, would, take, too, long, to, form, up, and, the, strategy, ran, a, greater, risk, of, fighters, being, caught, on, the, ground, refuelling, the, big, wing, idea, also, caused, pilots, to, overclaim, their, kills, due, to, the, confusion, of, a, more, intense, battle, zone, this, led, to, the, belief, big, wings, were, far, more, effective, than, they, actually, were, the, issue, caused, intense, friction, between, park, and, leigh, mallory, as, 12, group, was, tasked, with, protecting, 11, group, s, airfields, whilst, park, s, squadrons, intercepted, incoming, raids, the, delay, in, forming, up, big, wings, meant, the, formations, often, did, not, arrive, at, all, or, until, after, german, bombers, had, hit, 11, group, s, airfields, dowding, to, highlight, the, problem, of, the, big, wing, s, performance, submitted, a, report, compiled, by, park, to, the, air, ministry, on, 15, november, in, the, report, he, highlighted, that, during, the, period, of, 11, september, 31, october, the, extensive, use, of, the, big, wing, had, resulted, in, just, 10, interceptions, and, one, german, aircraft, destroyed, but, his, report, was, ignored, post, war, analysis, agrees, dowding, and, park, s, approach, was, best, for, 11, group, dowding, s, removal, from, his, post, in, november, 1940, has, been, blamed, on, this, struggle, between, park, and, leigh, mallory, s, daylight, strategy, the, intensive, raids, and, destruction, wrought, during, the, blitz, damaged, both, dowding, and, park, in, particular, for, the, failure, to, produce, an, effective, night, fighter, defence, system, something, for, which, the, influential, leigh, mallory, had, long, criticised, them, bomber, command, and, coastal, command, aircraft, flew, offensive, sorties, against, targets, in, germany, and, france, during, the, battle, an, hour, after, the, declaration, of, war, bomber, command, launched, raids, on, warships, and, naval, ports, by, day, and, in, night, raids, dropped, leaflets, as, it, was, considered, illegal, to, bomb, targets, which, could, affect, civilians, after, the, initial, disasters, of, the, war, with, vickers, wellington, bombers, shot, down, in, large, numbers, attacking, wilhelmshaven, and, the, slaughter, of, the, fairey, battle, squadrons, sent, to, france, it, became, clear, that, they, would, have, to, operate, mainly, at, night, to, avoid, incurring, very, high, losses, churchill, came, to, power, on, 10, may, 1940, and, the, war, cabinet, on, 12, may, agreed, that, german, actions, justified, unrestricted, warfare, and, on, 14, may, they, authorised, an, attack, on, the, night, of, 14, 15, may, against, oil, and, rail, targets, in, germany, at, the, urging, of, clement, attlee, the, cabinet, on, 15, may, authorised, a, full, bombing, strategy, against, suitable, military, objectives, even, where, there, could, be, civilian, casualties, that, evening, a, night, time, bomber, campaign, began, against, the, german, oil, industry, communications, and, forests, crops, mainly, in, the, ruhr, area, the, raf, lacked, accurate, night, navigation, and, carried, small, bomb, loads, as, the, threat, mounted, bomber, command, changed, targeting, priority, on, 3, june, 1940, to, attack, the, german, aircraft, industry, on, 4, july, the, air, ministry, gave, bomber, command, orders, to, attack, ports, and, shipping, by, september, the, build, up, of, invasion, barges, in, the, channel, ports, had, become, a, top, priority, target, on, 7, september, the, government, issued, a, warning, that, the, invasion, could, be, expected, within, the, next, few, days, and, that, night, bomber, command, attacked, the, channel, ports, and, supply, dumps, on, 13, september, they, carried, out, another, large, raid, on, the, channel, ports, sinking, 80, large, barges, in, the, port, of, ostend, 84, barges, were, sunk, in, dunkirk, after, another, raid, on, 17, september, and, by, 19, september, almost, 200, barges, had, been, sunk, the, loss, of, these, barges, may, have, contributed, to, hitler, s, decision, to, postpone, operation, sea, lion, indefinitely, the, success, of, these, raids, was, in, part, because, the, germans, had, few, freya, radar, stations, set, up, in, france, so, that, air, defences, of, the, french, harbours, were, not, nearly, as, good, as, the, air, defences, over, germany, bomber, command, had, directed, some, 60, of, its, strength, against, the, channel, ports, the, bristol, blenheim, units, also, raided, german, occupied, airfields, throughout, july, to, december, 1940, both, during, daylight, hours, and, at, night, although, most, of, these, raids, were, unproductive, there, were, some, successes, on, 1, august, five, out, of, twelve, blenheims, sent, to, attack, haamstede, and, evere, brussels, were, able, to, destroy, or, heavily, damage, three, bf, 109s, of, ii, jg, 27, and, apparently, kill, a, staffelkapit, n, identified, as, a, hauptmann, albrecht, von, ankum, frank, two, other, 109s, were, claimed, by, blenheim, gunners, another, successful, raid, on, haamstede, was, made, by, a, single, blenheim, on, 7, august, which, destroyed, one, 109, of, 4, jg, 54, heavily, damaged, another, and, caused, lighter, damage, to, four, more, there, were, some, missions, that, produced, an, almost, 100, casualty, rate, amongst, the, blenheims, one, such, operation, was, mounted, on, 13, august, 1940, against, a, luftwaffe, airfield, near, aalborg, in, north, eastern, denmark, by, 12, aircraft, of, 82, squadron, one, blenheim, returned, early, the, pilot, was, later, charged, and, due, to, appear, before, a, court, martial, but, was, killed, on, another, operation, the, other, eleven, which, reached, denmark, were, shot, down, five, by, flak, and, six, by, bf, 109s, of, the, 33, crewmen, who, took, part, in, the, attack, 20, were, killed, and, 13, captured, as, well, as, the, bombing, operations, blenheim, equipped, units, had, been, formed, to, carry, out, long, range, strategic, reconnaissance, missions, over, germany, and, german, occupied, territories, in, this, role, the, blenheims, again, proved, to, be, too, slow, and, vulnerable, against, luftwaffe, fighters, and, they, took, constant, casualties, coastal, command, directed, its, attention, towards, the, protection, of, british, shipping, and, the, destruction, of, enemy, shipping, as, invasion, became, more, likely, it, participated, in, the, strikes, on, french, harbours, and, airfields, laying, mines, and, mounting, numerous, reconnaissance, missions, over, the, enemy, held, coast, in, all, some, 9, 180, sorties, were, flown, by, bombers, from, july, to, october, 1940, although, this, was, much, less, than, the, 80, 000, sorties, flown, by, fighters, bomber, crews, suffered, about, half, the, total, casualties, borne, by, their, fighter, colleagues, the, bomber, contribution, was, therefore, much, more, dangerous, on, a, loss, per, sortie, comparison, bomber, reconnaissance, and, antisubmarine, patrol, operations, continued, throughout, these, months, with, little, respite, and, none, of, the, publicity, accorded, to, fighter, command, in, his, famous, 20, august, speech, about, the, few, praising, fighter, command, churchill, also, made, a, point, of, mentioning, bomber, command, s, contribution, adding, that, bombers, were, even, then, striking, back, at, germany, this, part, of, the, speech, is, often, overlooked, even, today, the, battle, of, britain, chapel, in, westminster, abbey, lists, in, a, roll, of, honour, 718, bomber, command, crew, members, and, 280, from, coastal, command, who, were, killed, between, 10, july, and, 31, october, bomber, and, coastal, command, attacks, against, invasion, barge, concentrations, in, channel, ports, were, widely, reported, by, the, british, media, during, september, and, october, 1940, in, what, became, known, as, the, battle, of, the, barges, raf, attacks, were, claimed, in, british, propaganda, to, have, sunk, large, numbers, of, barges, and, to, have, created, widespread, chaos, and, disruption, to, german, invasion, preparations, given, the, volume, of, british, propaganda, interest, in, these, bomber, attacks, during, september, and, earlier, october, it, is, striking, how, quickly, this, was, overlooked, once, the, battle, of, britain, had, been, concluded, even, by, mid, war, the, bomber, pilots, efforts, had, been, largely, eclipsed, by, a, continuing, focus, on, the, few, this, a, result, of, the, air, ministry, s, continuing, valorisation, of, the, fighter, boys, beginning, with, the, march, 1941, battle, of, britain, propaganda, pamphlet, one, of, the, biggest, oversights, of, the, entire, system, was, the, lack, of, adequate, air, sea, rescue, organisation, the, raf, had, started, organising, a, system, in, 1940, with, high, speed, launches, hsls, based, on, flying, boat, bases, and, at, some, overseas, locations, but, it, was, still, believed, that, the, amount, of, cross, channel, traffic, meant, that, there, was, no, need, for, a, rescue, service, to, cover, these, areas, downed, pilots, and, aircrew, it, was, hoped, would, be, picked, up, by, any, boats, or, ships, which, happened, to, be, passing, by, otherwise, the, local, life, boat, would, be, alerted, assuming, someone, had, seen, the, pilot, going, into, the, water, raf, aircrew, were, issued, with, a, life, jacket, nicknamed, the, mae, west, but, in, 1940, it, still, required, manual, inflation, which, was, almost, impossible, for, someone, who, was, injured, or, in, shock, the, waters, of, the, english, channel, and, dover, straits, are, cold, even, in, the, middle, of, summer, and, clothing, issued, to, raf, aircrew, did, little, to, insulate, them, against, these, freezing, conditions, the, raf, also, imitated, the, german, practice, of, issuing, fluorescein, a, conference, in, 1939, had, placed, air, sea, rescue, under, coastal, command, because, pilots, had, been, lost, at, sea, during, the, channel, battle, on, 22, august, control, of, raf, rescue, launches, was, passed, to, the, local, naval, authorities, and, 12, lysanders, were, given, to, fighter, command, to, help, look, for, pilots, at, sea, in, all, some, 200, pilots, and, aircrew, were, lost, at, sea, during, the, battle, no, proper, air, sea, rescue, service, was, formed, until, 1941, the, battle, covered, a, shifting, geographical, area, and, there, have, been, differing, opinions, on, significant, dates, when, the, air, ministry, proposed, 8, august, as, the, start, dowding, responded, that, operations, merged, into, one, another, almost, insensibly, and, proposed, 10, july, as, the, onset, of, increased, attacks, with, the, caution, that, phases, drifted, into, each, other, and, dates, are, not, firm, the, royal, air, force, museum, states, that, five, main, phases, can, be, identified, following, germany, s, rapid, territorial, gains, in, the, battle, of, france, the, luftwaffe, had, to, reorganise, its, forces, set, up, bases, along, the, coast, and, rebuild, after, heavy, losses, it, began, small, scale, bombing, raids, on, britain, on, the, night, of, 5, 6, june, and, continued, sporadic, attacks, throughout, june, and, july, the, first, large, scale, attack, was, at, night, on, 18, 19, june, when, small, raids, scattered, between, yorkshire, and, kent, involved, in, total, 100, bombers, these, st, rangriffe, nuisance, raids, which, involved, only, a, few, aeroplanes, sometimes, just, one, were, used, to, train, bomber, crews, in, both, day, and, night, attacks, to, test, defences, and, try, out, methods, with, most, flights, at, night, they, found, that, rather, than, carrying, small, numbers, of, large, high, explosive, bombs, it, was, more, effective, to, use, more, small, bombs, similarly, incendiaries, had, to, cover, a, large, area, to, set, effective, fires, these, training, flights, continued, through, august, and, into, the, first, week, of, september, against, this, the, raids, also, gave, the, british, time, to, assess, the, german, tactics, and, invaluable, time, for, the, raf, fighters, and, anti, aircraft, defences, to, prepare, and, gain, practice, the, attacks, were, widespread, over, the, night, of, 30, june, alarms, were, set, off, in, 20, counties, by, just, 20, bombers, then, next, day, the, first, daylight, raids, occurred, during, 1, july, on, both, hull, in, yorkshire, and, wick, caithness, on, 3, july, most, flights, were, reconnaissance, sorties, but, 15, civilians, were, killed, when, bombs, hit, guildford, in, surrey, numerous, small, st, rangriffe, raids, both, day, and, night, were, made, daily, through, august, september, and, into, the, winter, with, aims, including, bringing, raf, fighters, up, to, battle, destruction, of, specific, military, and, economic, targets, and, setting, off, air, raid, warnings, to, affect, civilian, morale, four, major, air, raids, in, august, involved, hundreds, of, bombers, in, the, same, month, 1, 062, small, raids, were, made, spread, across, the, whole, of, britain, the, kanalkampf, comprised, a, series, of, running, fights, over, convoys, in, the, english, channel, it, was, launched, partly, because, kesselring, and, sperrle, were, not, sure, about, what, else, to, do, and, partly, because, it, gave, german, aircrews, some, training, and, a, chance, to, probe, the, british, defences, dowding, could, provide, only, minimal, shipping, protection, and, these, battles, off, the, coast, tended, to, favour, the, germans, whose, bomber, escorts, had, the, advantage, of, altitude, and, outnumbered, the, raf, fighters, from, 9, july, reconnaissance, probing, by, dornier, do, 17, bombers, put, a, severe, strain, on, raf, pilots, and, machines, with, high, raf, losses, to, bf, 109s, when, nine, 141, squadron, defiants, went, into, action, on, 19, july, six, were, lost, to, bf, 109s, before, a, squadron, of, hurricanes, intervened, on, 25, july, a, coal, convoy, and, escorting, destroyers, suffered, such, heavy, losses, to, attacks, by, stuka, dive, bombers, that, the, admiralty, decided, convoys, should, travel, at, night, the, raf, shot, down, 16, raiders, but, lost, 7, aircraft, by, 8, august, 18, coal, ships, and, 4, destroyers, had, been, sunk, but, the, navy, was, determined, to, send, a, convoy, of, 20, ships, through, rather, than, move, the, coal, by, railway, after, repeated, stuka, attacks, that, day, six, ships, were, badly, damaged, four, were, sunk, and, only, four, reached, their, destination, the, raf, lost, 19, fighters, and, shot, down, 31, german, aircraft, the, navy, now, cancelled, all, further, convoys, through, the, channel, and, sent, the, cargo, by, rail, even, so, these, early, combat, encounters, provided, both, sides, with, experience, the, main, attack, upon, the, raf, s, defences, was, code, named, adlerangriff, eagle, attack, intelligence, reports, gave, g, ring, the, impression, that, the, raf, was, almost, defeated, and, raids, would, attract, british, fighters, for, the, luftwaffe, to, shoot, down, the, strategy, agreed, on, 6, august, was, to, destroy, raf, fighter, command, across, the, south, of, england, in, four, days, then, bombing, of, military, and, economic, targets, was, to, systematically, extend, up, to, the, midlands, until, daylight, attacks, could, proceed, unhindered, over, the, whole, of, britain, culminating, in, a, major, bombing, attack, on, london, poor, weather, delayed, adlertag, eagle, day, until, 13, august, 1940, on, 12, august, the, first, attempt, was, made, to, blind, the, dowding, system, when, aircraft, from, the, specialist, fighter, bomber, unit, erprobungsgruppe, 210, attacked, four, radar, stations, three, were, briefly, taken, off, the, air, but, were, back, working, within, six, hours, the, raids, appeared, to, show, that, british, radars, were, difficult, to, knock, out, the, failure, to, mount, follow, up, attacks, allowed, the, raf, to, get, the, stations, back, on, the, air, and, the, luftwaffe, neglected, strikes, on, the, supporting, infrastructure, such, as, phone, lines, and, power, stations, which, could, have, rendered, the, radars, useless, even, if, the, towers, themselves, which, were, very, difficult, to, destroy, remained, intact, adlertag, opened, with, a, series, of, attacks, led, again, by, erpro, 210, on, coastal, airfields, used, as, forward, landing, grounds, for, the, raf, fighters, as, well, as, satellite, airfields, including, manston, and, hawkinge, as, the, week, drew, on, the, airfield, attacks, moved, further, inland, and, repeated, raids, were, made, on, the, radar, chain, 15, august, was, the, greatest, day, when, the, luftwaffe, mounted, the, largest, number, of, sorties, of, the, campaign, luftflotte, 5, attacked, the, north, of, england, believing, fighter, command, strength, to, be, concentrated, in, the, south, raiding, forces, from, denmark, and, norway, ran, into, unexpectedly, strong, resistance, inadequately, escorted, by, bf, 110s, bf109s, having, insufficient, range, to, escort, raids, from, norway, bombers,

junkers, 88s, out, of, 115, bombers, and, 35, fighters, sent, 75, planes, were, destroyed, and, many, others, were, damaged, beyond, repair, furthermore, due, to, early, engagement, by, raf, fighters, many, of, the, bombers, dropped, their, payloads, ineffectively, early, as, a, result, of, these, casualties, luftflotte, 5, did, not, appear, in, strength, again, in, the, campaign, 18, august, which, had, the, greatest, number, of, casualties, to, both, sides, has, been, dubbed, the, hardest, day, following, this, grinding, battle, exhaustion, and, the, weather, reduced, operations, for, most, of, a, week, allowing, the, luftwaffe, to, review, their, performance, the, hardest, day, had, sounded, the, end, for, the, ju, 87, in, the, campaign, this, veteran, of, blitzkrieg, was, too, vulnerable, to, fighters, to, operate, over, britain, so, as, to, preserve, the, stuka, force, g, ring, withdrew, them, from, the, fighting, this, removed, the, main, luftwaffe, precision, bombing, weapon, and, shifted, the, burden, of, pinpoint, attacks, on, the, already, stretched, erpro, 210, the, bf, 110, proved, too, clumsy, for, dogfighting, with, single, engined, fighters, and, its, participation, was, scaled, back, it, would, be, used, only, when, range, required, it, or, when, sufficient, single, engined, escort, could, not, be, provided, for, the, bombers, g, ring, made, yet, another, important, decision, to, order, more, bomber, escorts, at, the, expense, of, free, hunting, sweeps, to, achieve, this, the, weight, of, the, attack, now, fell, on, luftflotte, 2, and, the, bulk, of, the, bf, 109s, in, luftflotte, 3, were, transferred, to, kesselring, s, command, reinforcing, the, fighter, bases, in, the, pas, de, calais, stripped, of, its, fighters, luftflotte, 3,

attacks, on, the, radar, chain, these, were, seen, as, unsuccessful, and, neither, the, reichsmarschall, nor, his, subordinates, realised, how, vital, the, chain, home, stations, were, to, the, defence, systems, it, was, known, that, radar, provided, some, early, warning, of, raids, but, the, belief, among, german, fighter, pilots, was, that, anything, bringing, up, the, tommies, to, fight, was, to, be, encouraged, on, the, afternoon, of, 15, august, hauptmann, walter, rubensd, rffer, leading, erprobungsgruppe, 210, mistakenly, bombed, croydon, airfield, on, the, outskirts, of, london,

retired, air, vice, marshal, peter, dye, head, of, the, raf, museum, discussed, the, logistics, of, the, battle, in, 2000, and, 2010, dealing, specifically, with, the, single, seat, fighters, dye, contends, that, not, only, was, british, aircraft, production, replacing, aircraft, but, replacement, pilots, were, keeping, pace, with, losses, the, number, of, pilots, in, raf, fighter, command, increased, during, july, august, and, september, the, figures, indicate, the, number, of, pilots, available, never, decreased, from, july, 1, 200, were, available, and, from, 1, august, 1, 400, were,

of, around, 1, 400, pilots, in, the, crucial, weeks, of, the, battle, in, the, second, half, of, september, it, reached, 1, 500, the, shortfall, of, pilots, was, never, above, 10, the, germans, never,

that, this, period, was, the, most, dangerous, of, all, in, the, narrow, margin, published, in, 1961, historians, derek, wood, and, derek, dempster, believed, that, the, two, weeks, from, 24, august, to, 6, september, represented, a, real, danger, according, to, them, from, 24, august, to, 6, september, 295, fighters, had, been, totally, destroyed, and, 171, badly, damaged, against, a, total, output, of, 269, new, and, repaired, spitfires, and, hurricanes, they, assert, that, 103, pilots, were, killed, or, missing, and, 128, were, wounded, which, represented, a, total, wastage, of, 120, pilots, per, week, out, of, a, fighting, strength, of, just, fewer, than, 1, 000, they, conclude, that, during, august, no, more, than, 260, fighter, pilots, were, turned, out, by, otus, and, casualties, in, the, same, month, were, just, over, 300, a, full, squadron, establishment, was, 26, pilots, whereas, the, average, in, august, was, 16, in, their, assessment, the, raf, was, losing, the, battle, denis, richards, in, his, 1953, contribution, to, the, official, british, account, history, of, the, second, world, war, agreed, that, lack, of, pilots, especially, experienced, ones, was, the, raf, s, greatest, problem, he, states, that, between, 8, and, 18, august, 154, raf, pilots, were, killed, severely, wounded, or, missing, while, only, 63, new, pilots, were, trained, availability, of, aircraft, was, also, a, serious, issue, while, its, reserves, during, the, battle, of, britain, never, declined, to, a, half, dozen, planes, as, some, later, claimed, richards, describes, 24, august, to, 6, september, as, the, critical, period, because, during, these, two, weeks, germany, destroyed, far, more, aircraft, through, its, attacks, on, 11, group, s, southeast, bases, than, britain, was, producing, three, more, weeks, of, such, a, pace, would, indeed, have, exhausted, aircraft, reserves, germany, had, seen, heavy, losses, of, pilots, and, aircraft, as, well, thus, its, shift, to, night, time, attacks, in, september, on, 7, september, raf, aircraft, losses, fell, below, british, production, and, remained, so, until, the, end, of, the, war, hitler, s, directive, no, 17, for, the, conduct, of, air, and, sea, warfare, against, england, issued, on, 1, august, 1940, reserved, to, himself, the, right, to, decide, on, terror, attacks, as, measures, of, reprisal, hitler, issued, a, directive, that, london, was, not, to, be, bombed, save, on, his, sole, instruction, in, preparation, detailed, target, plans, under, the, code, name, operation, loge, for, raids, on, communications, power, stations, armaments, works, and, docks, in, the, port, of, london, were, distributed, to, the, fliegerkorps, in, july, the, port, areas, were, crowded, next, to, residential, housing, and, civilian, casualties, would, be, expected, but, this, would, combine, military, and, economic, targets, with, indirect, effects, on, morale, the, strategy, agreed, on, 6, august, was, for, raids, on, military, and, economic, targets, in, towns, and, cities, to, culminate, in, a, major, attack, on, london, in, mid, august, raids, were, made, on, targets, on, the, outskirts, of, london, luftwaffe, doctrine, included, the, possibility, of, retaliatory, attacks, on, cities, and, since, 11, may, small, scale, night, raids, by, raf, bomber, command, had, frequently, bombed, residential, areas, the, germans, assumed, this, was, deliberate, and, as, the, raids, increased, in, frequency, and, scale, the, population, grew, impatient, for, measures, of, revenge, on, 25, august, 1940, 81, bombers, of, bomber, command, were, sent, out, to, raid, industrial, and, commercial, targets, in, berlin, clouds, prevented, accurate, identification, and, the, bombs, fell, across, the, city, causing, some, casualties, among, the, civilian, population, as, well, as, damage, to, residential, areas, continuing, raf, raids, on, berlin, led, to, hitler, withdrawing, his, directive, on, 30, august, and, giving, the, go, ahead, to, the, planned, bombing, offensive, on, 3, september, g, ring, planned, to, bomb, london, daily, with, general, albert, kesselring, s, enthusiastic, support, having, received, reports, the, average, strength, of, raf, squadrons, was, down, to, five, or, seven, fighters, out, of, twelve, and, their, airfields, in, the, area, were, out, of, action, hitler, issued, a, directive, on, 5, september, to, attack, cities, including, london, in, his, widely, publicised, speech, delivered, on, 4, september, 1940, hitler, condemned, the, bombing, of, berlin, and, presented, the, planned, attacks, on, london, as, reprisals, the, first, daylight, raid, was, titled, vergeltungsangriff, revenge, attack, on, 7, september, a, massive, series, of, raids, involving, nearly, four, hundred, bombers, and, more, than, six, hundred, fighters, targeted, docks, in, the, east, end, of, london, day, and, night, the, raf, anticipated, attacks, on, airfields, and, 11, group, rose, to, meet, them, in, greater, numbers, than, the, luftwaffe, expected, the, first, official, deployment, of, 12, group, s, leigh, mallory, s, big, wing, took, twenty, minutes, to, form, up, missing, its, intended, target, but, encountering, another, formation, of, bombers, while, still, climbing, they, returned, apologetic, about, their, limited, success, and, blamed, the, delay, on, being, scrambled, too, late, the, german, press, jubilantly, announced, that, one, great, cloud, of, smoke, stretches, tonight, from, the, middle, of, london, to, the, mouth, of, the, thames, reports, reflected, the, briefings, given, to, crews, before, the, raids, everyone, knew, about, the, last, cowardly, attacks, on, german, cities, and, thought, about, wives, mothers, and, children, and, then, came, that, word, vengeance, pilots, reported, seeing, ruined, airfields, as, they, flew, towards, london, appearances, which, gave, intelligence, reports, the, impression, of, devastated, defences, g, ring, maintained, that, the, raf, was, close, to, defeat, making, invasion, feasible, fighter, command, had, been, at, its, lowest, ebb, short, of, men, and, machines, and, the, break, from, airfield, attacks, allowed, them, to, recover, 11, group, had, considerable, success, in, breaking, up, daytime, raids, 12, group, repeatedly, disobeyed, orders, and, failed, to, meet, requests, to, protect, 11, group, airfields, but, their, experiments, with, increasingly, large, big, wings, had, some, success, the, luftwaffe, began, to, abandon, their, morning, raids, with, attacks, on, london, starting, late, in, the, afternoon, for, fifty, seven, consecutive, nights, the, most, damaging, aspect, to, the, luftwaffe, of, targeting, london, was, the, increased, distance, the, bf, 109e, escorts, had, a, limited, fuel, capacity, resulting, in, only, a, 660, km, 410, mile, maximum, range, solely, on, internal, fuel, and, when, they, arrived, had, only, 10, minutes, of, flying, time, before, turning, for, home, leaving, the, bombers, undefended, by, fighter, escorts, its, eventual, stablemate, the, focke, wulf, fw, 190, a, was, flying, only, in, prototype, form, in, mid, 1940, the, first, 28, fw, 190s, were, not, delivered, until, november, 1940, the, fw, 190a, 1, had, a, maximum, range, of, 940, km, 584, miles, on, internal, fuel, 40, greater, than, the, bf, 109e, the, messerschmitt, bf, 109, e, 7, corrected, this, deficiency, by, adding, a, ventral, centre, line, ordnance, rack, to, take, either, an, sc, 250, bomb, or, a, standard, 300, litre, luftwaffe, drop, tank, to, double, the, range, to, 1, 325, km, 820, mi, the, ordnance, rack, was, not, retrofitted, to, earlier, bf, 109es, until, october, 1940, on, 14, september, hitler, chaired, a, meeting, with, the, okw, staff, g, ring, was, in, france, directing, the, decisive, battle, so, erhard, milch, deputised, for, him, hitler, asked, should, we, call, it, off, altogether, general, hans, jeschonnek, luftwaffe, chief, of, staff, begged, for, a, last, chance, to, defeat, the, raf, and, for, permission, to, launch, attacks, on, civilian, residential, areas, to, cause, mass, panic, hitler, refused, the, latter, perhaps, unaware, of, how, much, damage, had, already, been, done, to, civilian, targets, he, reserved, for, himself, the, power, to, unleash, the, terror, weapon, instead, political, will, was, to, be, broken, by, destroying, the, material, infrastructure, the, weapons, industry, and, stocks, of, fuel, and, food, on, 15, september, two, massive, waves, of, german, attacks, were, decisively, repulsed, by, the, raf, by, deploying, every, aircraft, in, 11, group, sixty, german, and, twenty, six, raf, aircraft, were, shot, down, the, action, was, the, climax, of, the, battle, of, britain, two, days, after, the, german, defeat, hitler, postponed, preparations, for, the, invasion, of, britain, henceforth, in, the, face, of, mounting, losses, in, men, aircraft, and, the, lack, of, adequate, replacements, the, luftwaffe, completed, their, gradual, shift, from, daylight, bomber, raids, and, continued, with, nighttime, bombing, 15, september, is, commemorated, as, battle, of, britain, day, at, the, 14, september, okw, conference, hitler, acknowledged, that, the, luftwaffe, had, still, not, gained, the, air, superiority, needed, for, the, operation, sea, lion, invasion, in, agreement, with, raeder, s, written, recommendation, hitler, said, the, campaign, was, to, intensify, regardless, of, invasion, plans, the, decisive, thing, is, the, ceaseless, continuation, of, air, attacks, jeschonnek, proposed, attacking, residential, areas, to, cause, mass, panic, but, hitler, turned, this, down, he, reserved, to, himself, the, option, of, terror, bombing, british, morale, was, to, be, broken, by, destroying, infrastructure, armaments, manufacturing, fuel, and, food, stocks, on, 16, september, g, ring, gave, the, order, for, this, change, in, strategy, this, new, phase, was, to, be, the, first, independent, strategic, bombing, campaign, in, hopes, of, a, political, success, forcing, the, british, to, give, up, hitler, hoped, it, might, result, in, eight, million, going, mad, referring, to, the, population, of, london, in, 1940, which, would, cause, a, catastrophe, for, the, british, in, those, circumstances, hitler, said, even, a, small, invasion, might, go, a, long, way, hitler, was, against, cancelling, the, invasion, as, the, cancellation, would, reach, the, ears, of, the, enemy, and, strengthen, his, resolve, on, 19, september, hitler, ordered, a, reduction, in, work, on, operation, sea, lion, he, doubted, if, strategic, bombing, could, achieve, its, aims, but, ending, the, air, war, would, be, an, open, admission, of, defeat, he, had, to, maintain, the, appearance, of, concentration, on, defeating, britain, to, conceal, from, joseph, stalin, his, covert, aim, to, invade, the, soviet, union, throughout, the, battle, most, luftwaffe, bombing, raids, had, been, at, night, they, increasingly, suffered, unsustainable, losses, in, daylight, raids, and, the, last, massive, daytime, attacks, were, on, 15, september, a, raid, of, 70, bombers, on, 18, september, also, suffered, badly, and, day, raids, were, gradually, phased, out, leaving, the, main, attacks, at, night, fighter, command, still, lacked, any, effective, capacity, to, intercept, night, time, raiders, the, night, fighters, mostly, blenheims, and, beaufighters, at, this, time, lacked, airborne, radar, and, so, could, not, find, the, bombers, anti, aircraft, guns, were, diverted, to, london, s, defences, but, had, a, much, reduced, success, rate, against, night, attacks, from, mid, september, luftwaffe, daylight, bombing, was, gradually, taken, over, by, bf, 109, fighters, adapted, to, take, one, 250, kg, bomb, small, groups, of, fighter, bombers, would, carry, out, st, rangriffe, raids, escorted, by, large, escort, formations, of, about, 200, to, 300, combat, fighters, they, flew, at, altitudes, over, 20, 000, feet, 6, 100, m, where, the, bf, 109, had, an, advantage, over, raf, fighters, except, the, spitfire, the, raids, disturbed, civilians, and, continued, the, war, of, attrition, against, fighter, command, the, raids, were, intended, to, carry, out, precision, bombing, on, military, or, economic, targets, but, it, was, hard, to, achieve, sufficient, accuracy, with, the, single, bomb, sometimes, when, attacked, the, fighter, bombers, had, to, jettison, the, bomb, to, function, as, fighters, the, raf, was, at, a, disadvantage, and, changed, defensive, tactics, by, introducing, standing, patrols, of, spitfires, at, high, altitude, to, monitor, incoming, raids, on, a, sighting, other, patrols, at, lower, altitude, would, fly, up, to, join, the, battle, a, junkers, ju, 88, returning, from, a, raid, on, london, was, shot, down, in, kent, on, 27, september, resulting, in, the, battle, of, graveney, marsh, the, last, action, between, british, and, foreign, military, forces, on, british, mainland, soil, german, bombing, of, britain, reached, its, peak, in, october, and, november, 1940, in, post, war, interrogation, wilhelm, keitel, described, the, aims, as, economic, blockade, in, conjunction, with, submarine, warfare, and, attrition, of, britain, s, military, and, economic, resources, the, luftwaffe, wanted, to, achieve, victory, on, its, own, and, was, reluctant, to, cooperate, with, the, navy, their, strategy, for, the, blockade, was, to, destroy, ports, and, storage, facilities, in, towns, and, cities, priorities, were, based, on, the, pattern, of, trade, and, distribution, so, for, these, months, london, was, the, main, target, in, november, their, attention, turned, to, other, ports, and, industrial, targets, around, britain, hitler, postponed, the, sealion, invasion, on, 13, october, until, the, spring, of, 1941, it, was, not, until, hitler, s, directive, 21, was, issued, on, 18, december, 1940, that, the, threat, to, britain, of, invasion, finally, ended, during, the, battle, and, for, the, rest, of, the, war, an, important, factor, in, keeping, public, morale, high, was, the, continued, presence, in, london, of, king, george, vi, and, his, wife, queen, elizabeth, when, war, broke, out, in, 1939, the, king, and, queen, decided, to, stay, in, london, and, not, flee, to, canada, as, had, been, suggested, george, vi, and, elizabeth, officially, stayed, in, buckingham, palace, throughout, the, war, although, they, often, spent, weekends, at, windsor, castle, to, visit, their, daughters, elizabeth, the, future, queen, and, margaret, buckingham, palace, was, damaged, by, bombs, which, landed, in, the, grounds, on, 10, september, and, on, 13, september, more, serious, damage, was, caused, by, two, bombs, which, destroyed, the, royal, chapel, the, royal, couple, were, in, a, small, sitting, room, about, 80, yards, from, where, the, bombs, exploded, on, 24, september, in, recognition, of, the, bravery, of, civilians, king, george, vi, inaugurated, the, award, of, the, george, cross, overall, by, 2, november, the, raf, fielded, 1, 796, pilots, an, increase, of, over, 40, from, july, 1940, s, count, of, 1, 259, pilots, based, on, german, sources, from, a, luftwaffe, intelligence, officer, otto, bechtle, attached, to, kg, 2, in, february, 1944, translated, by, the, air, historical, branch, stephen, bungay, asserts, german, fighter, and, bomber, strength, declined, without, recovery, and, that, from, august, december, 1940, the, german, fighter, and, bomber, strength, declined, by, 30, and, 25, per, cent, in, contrast, williamson, murray, argues, using, translations, by, the, air, historical, branch, that, 1, 380, german, bombers, were, on, strength, on, 29, june, 1940, 1, 420, bombers, on, 28, september, 1, 423, level, bombers, on, 2, november, and, 1, 393, bombers, on, 30, november, 1940, in, july, september, the, number, of, luftwaffe, pilots, available, fell, by, 136, but, the, number, of, operational, pilots, had, shrunk, by, 171, by, september, the, training, organisation, of, the, luftwaffe, was, failing, to, replace, losses, german, fighter, pilots, in, contrast, to, popular, perception, were, not, afforded, training, or, rest, rotations, unlike, their, british, counterparts, the, first, week, of, september, accounted, for, 25, of, fighter, command, s, and, 24, of, the, luftwaffe, s, overall, losses, between, the, dates, 26, august, 6, september, on, only, one, day, 1, september, did, the, germans, destroy, more, aircraft, than, they, lost, losses, were, 325, german, and, 248, british, luftwaffe, losses, for, august, numbered, 774, aircraft, to, all, causes, representing, 18, 5, of, all, combat, aircraft, at, the, beginning, of, the, month, fighter, command, s, losses, in, august, were, 426, fighters, destroyed, amounting, to, 40, per, cent, of, 1, 061, fighters, available, on, 3, august, in, addition, 99, german, bombers, and, 27, other, types, were, destroyed, between, 1, and, 29, august, from, july, to, september, the, luftwaffe, s, loss, records, indicate, the, loss, of, 1, 636, aircraft, 1, 184, to, enemy, action, this, represented, 47, of, the, initial, strength, of, single, engined, fighters, 66, of, twin, engined, fighters, and, 45, of, bombers, this, indicates, the, germans, were, running, out, of, aircrew, as, well, as, aircraft, throughout, the, battle, the, germans, greatly, underestimated, the, size, of, the, raf, and, the, scale, of, british, aircraft, production, across, the, channel, the, air, intelligence, division, of, the, air, ministry, consistently, overestimated, the, size, of, the, german, air, enemy, and, the, productive, capacity, of, the, german, aviation, industry, as, the, battle, was, fought, both, sides, exaggerated, the, losses, inflicted, on, the, other, by, an, equally, large, margin, the, intelligence, picture, formed, before, the, battle, encouraged, the, luftwaffe, to, believe, that, such, losses, pushed, fighter, command, to, the, very, edge, of, defeat, while, the, exaggerated, picture, of, german, air, strength, persuaded, the, raf, that, the, threat, it, faced, was, larger, and, more, dangerous, than, was, the, case, this, led, the, british, to, the, conclusion, that, another, fortnight, of, attacks, on, airfields, might, force, fighter, command, to, withdraw, their, squadrons, from, the, south, of, england, the, german, misconception, on, the, other, hand, encouraged, first, complacency, then, strategic, misjudgement, the, shift, of, targets, from, air, bases, to, industry, and, communications, was, taken, because, it, was, assumed, that, fighter, command, was, virtually, eliminated, between, 24, august, and, 4, september, german, serviceability, rates, which, were, acceptable, at, stuka, units, were, running, at, 75, with, bf, 109s, 70, with, bombers, and, 65, with, bf, 110s, indicating, a, shortage, of, spare, parts, all, units, were, well, below, established, strength, the, attrition, was, beginning, to, affect, the, fighters, in, particular, by, 14, september, the, luftwaffe, s, bf, 109, geschwader, possessed, only, 67, of, their, operational, crews, against, authorised, aircraft, for, bf, 110, units, it, was, 46, per, cent, and, for, bombers, it, was, 59, per, cent, a, week, later, the, figures, had, dropped, to, 64, per, cent, 52, and, 52, per, cent, serviceability, rates, in, fighter, command, s, fighter, squadrons, between, 24, august, and, 7, september, were, listed, as, 64, 8, on, 24, august, 64, 7, on, 31, august, and, 64, 25, on, 7, september, 1940, due, to, the, failure, of, the, luftwaffe, to, establish, air, supremacy, a, conference, assembled, on, 14, september, at, hitler, s, headquarters, hitler, concluded, that, air, superiority, had, not, yet, been, established, and, promised, to, review, the, situation, on, 17, september, for, possible, landings, on, 27, september, or, 8, october, three, days, later, when, the, evidence, was, clear, that, the, german, air, force, had, greatly, exaggerated, the, extent, of, their, successes, against, the, raf, hitler, postponed, sea, lion, indefinitely, propaganda, was, an, important, element, of, the, air, war, which, began, to, develop, over, britain, from, 18, june, 1940, onwards, when, the, luftwaffe, began, small, probing, daylight, raids, to, test, raf, defences, one, of, many, examples, of, these, small, scale, raids, was, the, destruction, of, a, school, at, polruan, in, cornwall, by, a, single, raider, into, early, july, the, british, media, s, focus, on, the, air, battles, increased, steadily, the, press, magazines, bbc, radio, and, newsreels, daily, conveying, the, contents, of, air, ministry, communiques, the, german, okw, communiques, matched, britain, s, efforts, in, claiming, the, upper, hand, central, to, the, propaganda, war, on, both, sides, of, the, channel, were, aircraft, claims, which, are, discussed, under, attrition, statistics, above, these, daily, claims, were, important, both, for, sustaining, british, home, front, morale, and, persuading, america, to, support, britain, and, were, produced, by, the, air, ministry, s, air, intelligence, branch, under, pressure, from, american, journalists, and, broadcasters, to, prove, that, the, raf, s, claims, were, genuine, raf, intelligence, compared, pilots, claims, with, actual, aircraft, wrecks, and, those, seen, to, crash, into, the, sea, it, was, soon, realised, that, there, was, a, discrepancy, between, the, two, but, the, air, ministry, decided, not, to, reveal, this, in, fact, it, was, not, until, may, 1947, that, the, actual, figures, were, released, to, the, public, by, which, time, it, was, of, far, less, importance, many, though, refused, to, believe, the, revised, figures, including, douglas, bader, the, place, of, the, battle, of, britain, in, british, popular, memory, partly, stems, from, the, air, ministry, s, successful, propaganda, campaign, in, july, october, 1940, and, its, valorisation, of, the, defending, pilots, from, march, 1941, onwards, the, 3d, pamphlet, the, battle, of, britain, sold, in, huge, numbers, internationally, leading, even, goebbels, to, admire, its, propaganda, value, focusing, only, upon, the, fighter, pilots, with, no, mention, of, raf, bomber, attacks, against, invasion, barges, the, battle, of, britain, was, soon, established, as, a, major, victory, for, fighter, command, this, inspired, feature, films, books, magazines, works, of, art, poetry, radio, plays, and, moi, short, films, the, air, ministry, also, developed, the, battle, of, britain, sunday, commemoration, supported, a, battle, of, britain, clasp, for, issue, to, the, pilots, in, 1945, and, from, 1945, battle, of, britain, week, the, battle, of, britain, window, in, westminster, abbey, was, also, encouraged, by, the, air, ministry, lords, trenchard, and, dowding, on, its, committee, by, july, 1947, when, the, window, was, unveiled, the, battle, of, britain, had, already, attained, central, prominence, as, fighter, command, s, most, notable, victory, the, fighter, pilots, credited, with, preventing, invasion, in, 1940, although, given, widespread, media, coverage, in, september, and, october, 1940, raf, bomber, and, coastal, command, raids, against, invasion, barge, concentrations, were, less, well, remembered, the, battle, of, britain, marked, the, first, major, defeat, of, germany, s, military, forces, with, air, superiority, seen, as, the, key, to, victory, pre, war, theories, had, led, to, exaggerated, fears, of, strategic, bombing, and, uk, public, opinion, was, buoyed, by, coming, through, the, ordeal, for, the, raf, fighter, command, had, achieved, a, great, victory, in, successfully, carrying, out, sir, thomas, inskip, s, 1937, air, policy, of, preventing, the, germans, from, knocking, britain, out, of, the, war, the, battle, also, significantly, shifted, american, opinion, during, the, battle, many, americans, accepted, the, view, promoted, by, joseph, kennedy, the, american, ambassador, in, london, who, believed, that, the, united, kingdom, could, not, survive, roosevelt, wanted, a, second, opinion, and, sent, william, wild, bill, donovan, on, a, brief, visit, to, the, uk, he, became, convinced, the, uk, would, survive, and, should, be, supported, in, every, possible, way, before, the, end, of, the, year, american, journalist, ralph, ingersoll, after, returning, from, britain, published, a, book, concluding, that, adolf, hitler, met, his, first, defeat, in, eight, years, in, what, might, go, down, in, history, as, a, battle, as, important, as, waterloo, or, gettysburg, the, turning, point, was, when, the, germans, reduced, the, intensity, of, the, blitz, after, 15, september, according, to, ingersoll, majority, of, responsible, british, officers, who, fought, through, this, battle, believe, that, if, hitler, and, g, ring, had, had, the, courage, and, the, resources, to, lose, 200, planes, a, day, for, the, next, five, days, nothing, could, have, saved, london, instead, morale, in, combat, is, definitely, broken, and, the, raf, has, been, gaining, in, strength, each, week, both, sides, in, the, battle, made, exaggerated, claims, of, numbers, of, enemy, aircraft, shot, down, in, general, claims, were, two, to, three, times, the, actual, numbers, postwar, analysis, of, records, has, shown, that, between, july, and, september, the, raf, claimed, 2, 698, kills, while, the, luftwaffe, fighters, claimed, 3, 198, raf, aircraft, downed, total, losses, and, start, and, end, dates, for, recorded, losses, vary, for, both, sides, luftwaffe, losses, from, 10, july, to, 30, october, 1940, total, 1, 977, aircraft, including, 243, twin, and, 569, single, engined, fighters, 822, bombers, and, 343, non, combat, types, in, the, same, period, raf, fighter, command, aircraft, losses, number, 1, 087, including, 53, twin, engined, fighters, to, the, raf, figure, should, be, added, 376, bomber, command, and, 148, coastal, command, aircraft, lost, conducting, bombing, mining, and, reconnaissance, operations, in, defence, of, the, country, stephen, bungay, describes, dowding, and, park, s, strategy, of, choosing, when, to, engage, the, enemy, whilst, maintaining, a, coherent, force, as, vindicated, their, leadership, and, the, subsequent, debates, about, strategy, and, tactics, had, created, enmity, among, raf, senior, commanders, and, both, were, sacked, from, their, posts, in, the, immediate, aftermath, of, the, battle, all, things, considered, the, raf, proved, to, be, a, robust, and, capable, organisation, that, was, to, use, all, the, modern, resources, available, to, it, to, the, maximum, advantage, richard, evans, writes, irrespective, of, whether, hitler, was, really, set, on, this, course, he, simply, lacked, the, resources, to, establish, the, air, superiority, that, was, the, sine, qua, non, of, a, successful, crossing, of, the, english, channel, a, third, of, the, initial, strength, of, the, german, air, force, the, luftwaffe, had, been, lost, in, the, western, campaign, in, the, spring, the, germans, lacked, the, trained, pilots, the, effective, fighter, aircraft, and, the, heavy, bombers, that, would, have, been, needed, the, germans, launched, some, spectacular, attacks, against, important, british, industries, but, they, could, not, destroy, the, british, industrial, potential, and, made, little, systematic, effort, to, do, so, hindsight, does, not, disguise, the, fact, the, threat, to, fighter, command, was, very, real, and, for, the, participants, it, seemed, as, if, there, was, a, narrow, margin, between, victory, and, defeat, nevertheless, even, if, the, german, attacks, on, the, 11, group, airfields, which, guarded, southeast, england, and, the, approaches, to, london, had, continued, the, raf, could, have, withdrawn, to, the, midlands, out, of, german, fighter, range, and, continued, the, battle, from, there, the, victory, was, as, much, psychological, as, physical, writes, alfred, price, the, truth, of, the, matter, borne, out, by, the, events, of, 18, august, is, more, prosaic, neither, by, attacking, the, airfields, nor, by, attacking, london, was, the, luftwaffe, likely, to, destroy, fighter, command, given, the, size, of, the, british, fighter, force, and, the, general, high, quality, of, its, equipment, training, and, morale, the, luftwaffe, could, have, achieved, no, more, than, a, pyrrhic, victory, during, the, action, on, 18, august, it, had, cost, the, luftwaffe, five, trained, aircrew, killed, wounded, or, taken, prisoner, for, each, british, fighter, pilot, killed, or, wounded, the, ratio, was, similar, on, other, days, in, the, battle, and, this, ratio, of, 5, 1, was, very, close, to, that, between, the, number, of, german, aircrew, involved, in, the, battle, and, those, in, fighter, command, in, other, words, the, two, sides, were, suffering, almost, the, same, losses, in, trained, aircrew, in, proportion, to, their, overall, strengths, in, the, battle, of, britain, for, the, first, time, during, the, second, world, war, the, german, war, machine, had, set, itself, a, major, task, which, it, patently, failed, to, achieve, and, so, demonstrated, that, it, was, not, invincible, in, stiffening, the, resolve, of, those, determined, to, resist, hitler, the, battle, was, an, important, turning, point, in, the, conflict, some, historians, are, more, cautious, in, assessing, the, significance, of, germany, s, failure, to, knock, britain, out, of, the, war, bungay, writes, victory, in, the, air, achieved, a, modest, strategic, goal, for, it, did, not, bring, britain, any, closer, to, victory, in, the, war, but, merely, avoided, her, defeat, overy, states, the, battle, of, britain, did, not, seriously, weaken, germany, and, her, allies, nor, did, it, much, reduce, the, scale, of, the, threat, facing, britain, and, the, commonwealth, in, 1940, 41, until, german, and, japanese, aggression, brought, the, soviet, union, and, the, united, states, into, the, conflict, the, british, victory, in, the, battle, of, britain, was, achieved, at, a, heavy, cost, total, british, civilian, losses, from, july, to, december, 1940, were, 23, 002, dead, and, 32, 138, wounded, with, one, of, the, largest, single, raids, on, 19, december, 1940, in, which, almost, 3, 000, civilians, died, with, the, culmination, of, the, concentrated, daylight, raids, britain, was, able, to, rebuild, its, military, forces, and, establish, itself, as, an, allied, stronghold, later, serving, as, a, base, from, which, the, liberation, of, western, europe, was, launched, winston, churchill, summed, up, the, battle, with, the, words, never, in, the, field, of, human, conflict, was, so, much, owed, by, so, many, to, so, few, pilots, who, fought, in, the, battle, have, been, known, as, the, few, ever, since, at, times, being, specially, commemorated, on, 15, september, battle, of, britain, day, on, this, day, in, 1940, the, luftwaffe, embarked, on, their, largest, bombing, attack, yet, forcing, the, engagement, of, the, entirety, of, the, raf, in, defence, of, london, and, the, south, east, which, resulted, in, a, decisive, british, victory, that, proved, to, mark, a, turning, point, in, britain, s, favour, within, the, commonwealth, battle, of, britain, day, has, been, observed, more, usually, on, the, third, sunday, in, september, and, even, on, the, 2nd, thursday, in, september, in, some, areas, in, the, british, channel, islands, plans, for, the, battle, of, britain, window, in, westminster, abbey, were, begun, during, wartime, the, committee, chaired, by, lords, trenchard, and, dowding, public, donations, paid, for, the, window, itself, which, replaced, a, window, destroyed, during, the, campaign, this, officially, opened, by, king, george, vi, on, 10, july, 1947, although, not, actually, an, official, memorial, to, the, battle, of, britain, in, the, sense, that, government, paid, for, it, the, window, and, chapel, have, since, been, viewed, as, such, during, the, late, 1950s, and, 1960, various, proposals, were, advanced, for, a, national, monument, to, the, battle, of, britain, this, also, the, focus, of, several, letters, in, the, times, in, 1960, the, conservative, government, decided, against, a, further, monument, taking, the, view, that, the, credit, should, be, shared, more, broadly, than, fighter, command, alone, and, there, was, little, public, appetite, for, one, all, subsequent, memorials, are, the, result, of, private, subscription, and, initiative, as, discussed, below, there, are, numerous, memorials, to, the, battle, the, most, important, ones, are, the, battle, of, britain, monument, in, london, and, the, battle, of, britain, memorial, at, capel, le, ferne, in, kent, as, well, as, westminster, abbey, st, james, s, church, paddington, also, has, a, memorial, window, to, the, battle, replacing, a, window, destroyed, during, it, there, is, also, a, memorial, at, the, former, croydon, airport, one, of, the, raf, bases, during, the, battle, and, a, memorial, to, the, pilots, at, armadale, castle, on, the, isle, of, skye, in, scotland, which, is, topped, by, a, raven, sculpture, the, polish, pilots, who, served, in, the, battle, are, among, the, names, on, the, polish, war, memorial, in, west, london, there, are, also, two, museums, to, the, battle, one, at, hawkinge, in, kent, and, one, at, stanmore, in, london, at, the, former, raf, bentley, priory, in, 2015, the, raf, created, an, online, battle, of, britain, 75th, anniversary, commemorative, mosaic, composed, of, pictures, of, the, few, the, pilots, and, aircrew, who, fought, in, the, battle, and, the, many, the, often, unsung, others, whose, contribution, during, the, battle, of, britain, was, also, vital, to, the, raf, s, victory, in, the, skies, above, britain, submitted, by, participants, and, their, families
