the, war, italy, had, been, devastated, and, depopulated, it, was, seen, as, a, pyrrhic, victory, for, the, byzantines, who, found, themselves, incapable, of, resisting, an, invasion, by, the, lombards, in, 568, which, resulted, in, constantinople, permanently, losing, control, over, large, parts, of, the, italian, peninsula, in, 476, odoacer, deposed, emperor, romulus, augustulus, and,

for, sanctuary, if, she, was, deposed, amalasuntha, remained, in, italy, in, 533, using, a, dynastic, dispute, as, a, pretext, justinian, sent, his, most, talented, general, belisarius, to, recover, the, north, african, provinces, held, by, the, vandals, the, vandalic, war, produced, an, unexpectedly, swift, and, decisive, victory, for, the, byzantine, empire, and, encouraged, justinian, in, his,

the, forces, made, available, to, belisarius, were, small, especially, when, compared, with, the, much, larger, army, he, had, fielded, against, the, vandals, an, enemy, much, weaker, than, the, ostrogoths, the, preparations, for, the, operation, were, carried, out, in, secret, while, justinian, tried, to, secure, the, neutrality, of, the, franks, with, gifts, of, gold, belisarius, landed, at, sicily, between, roman, africa, and, italy, whose, population, was, well, disposed, toward, the, empire, the, island, was, quickly, captured, with, the, only, determined, resistance, at, panormus, palermo, overcome, by, late, december, belisarius, prepared, to, cross, to, italy, and, theodahad, sent, envoys, to, justinian, proposing, at, first, to, cede, sicily, and, recognise, his,

ordered, belisarius, to, cross, into, italy, constantinianus, accomplished, his, task, speedily, the, gothic, general, gripas, abandoned, salona, which, he, had, only, recently, occupied, because, of, the, ruined, state, of, its, fortifications, and, the, pro, roman, stance, of, its, citizens, withdrawing, to, the, north, constantinianus, occupied, the, city, and, rebuilt, the, walls, seven, days, later, the, gothic, army, departed, for, italy, and, by, late, june, the, whole, of, dalmatia, was, in, roman, hands, in, the, late, spring, of, 536, belisarius, crossed, into, italy, where, he, captured, rhegium, and, made, his, way, north, neapolis, in, modern, english, naples, was, besieged, for, three, weeks, before, the, imperial, troops, forced, their, way, in, during, november, the, largely, barbarian, roman, army, sacked, the, city, belisarius, moved, north, to, rome, which, in, view, of, the, fate, of, neapolis, put, up, no, resistance, belisarius, entered, unopposed, in, december, the, rapidity, of, the, byzantine, advance, took, the, goths, by, surprise, and, the, inactivity, of, theodahad, enraged, them, after, the, fall, of, neapolis, he, was, deposed, and, replaced, by, vitiges, he, left, rome, for, ravenna, where, he, married, amalasuntha, s, daughter, matasuntha, and, began, rallying, his, forces, against, the, invasion, vitiges, led, a, large, force, against, rome, where, belisarius, who, did, not, have, enough, troops, to, face, the, goths, in, the, open, field, remained, the, subsequent, siege, of, rome, the, first, of, three, in, the, gothic, war, lasted, from, march, 537, to, march, 538, there, were, sallies, minor, engagements, and, several, large, actions, but, after, 1, 600, huns, and, slavs, arrived, from, constantinople, in, april, 537, and, 5, 000, men, in, november, the, byzantines, took, the, offensive, and, their, cavalry, captured, several, towns, in, the, goths, rear, the, imperial, navy, cut, off, the, goths, from, seaborne, supplies, worsening, their, supply, difficulties, and, threatened, gothic, civilians, the, fall, of, ariminum, modern, rimini, close, to, ravenna, forced, vitiges, to, abandon, the, siege, and, withdraw, as, vitiges, marched, to, the, northeast, he, strengthened, the, garrisons, of, towns, and, forts, along, the, way, to, secure, his, rear, and, then, turned, towards, ariminum, the, roman, force, of, 2, 000, horsemen, occupying, it, comprised, some, of, belisarius, finest, cavalry, belisarius, decided, to, replace, them, with, an, infantry, garrison, their, commander, john, refused, to, obey, orders, and, remained, at, ariminum, shortly, after, the, goths, arrived, an, assault, failed, but, the, city, had, few, supplies, with, which, to, stand, a, siege, a, new, force, of, 2, 000, herul, foederati, under, the, armenian, eunuch, narses, arrived, at, picenum, belisarius, met, narses, who, advocated, a, relief, expedition, to, ariminum, while, belisarius, favoured, a, more, cautious, approach, the, arrival, of, a, letter, from, john, which, illustrated, the, immediate, danger, of, the, city, s, fall, resolved, the, issue, in, favour, of, narses, belisarius, divided, his, army, into, three, a, seaborne, force, under, his, capable, and, trusted, lieutenant, ildiger, another, under, the, equally, experienced, martin, which, was, to, arrive, from, the, south, and, the, main, force, under, him, and, narses, which, was, to, arrive, from, the, northwest, vitiges, learned, of, their, approach, and, faced, with, the, prospect, of, being, surrounded, by, superior, forces, hurriedly, withdrew, to, ravenna, the, bloodless, victory, at, ariminum, strengthened, narses, against, belisarius, with, many, roman, generals, including, john, turning, their, allegiance, to, him, in, the, council, after, the, relief, of, ariminum, belisarius, was, in, favour, of, reducing, the, strong, gothic, garrison, of, auximum, modern, osimo, in, their, rear, and, relieving, the, siege, of, mediolanum, narses, favoured, a, less, concentrated, effort, including, a, campaign, in, aemilia, belisarius, did, not, allow, matters, to, fester, and, marched, with, narses, and, john, against, urbinum, the, two, armies, encamped, separately, and, shortly, afterwards, narses, convinced, that, the, town, was, unassailable, and, well, supplied, broke, camp, and, departed, for, ariminum, from, there, he, sent, john, to, aemilia, which, was, quickly, subdued, aided, by, the, fortunate, drying, up, of, urbinum, s, only, water, spring, the, town, fell, to, belisarius, soon, after, in, april, 538, belisarius, petitioned, by, representatives, from, mediolanum, milan, the, second, most, populous, and, wealthy, city, in, italy, after, rome, had, sent, a, force, of, 1, 000, men, under, mundilas, to, the, city, this, force, secured, the, city, and, most, of, liguria, except, ticinum, pavia, with, ease, vitiges, called, upon, the, franks, for, help, and, a, force, of, 10, 000, burgundians, unexpectedly, crossed, the, alps, combining, with, the, goths, under, uraias, they, laid, siege, to, the, city, mediolanum, was, ill, provisioned, and, under, garrisoned, the, already, small, roman, force, had, been, dispersed, to, garrison, the, neighbouring, cities, and, forts, a, relief, force, was, dispatched, by, belisarius, but, its, commanders, martin, and, uliaris, did, not, make, any, effort, to, help, the, besieged, city, instead, they, asked, for, further, reinforcements, by, the, forces, of, john, and, the, magister, militum, per, illyricum, justin, which, were, operating, in, the, nearby, province, of, aemilia, dissension, in, the, roman, chain, of, command, exacerbated, the, situation, as, john, and, justin, refused, to, move, without, orders, from, narses, john, fell, ill, and, the, preparations, were, halted, the, delays, proved, fatal, for, the, city, which, after, many, months, of, siege, was, close, to, starvation, the, goths, offered, mundilas, a, guarantee, that, the, lives, of, his, soldiers, would, be, spared, if, he, surrendered, the, city, but, no, guarantee, was, offered, for, the, civilians, and, he, refused, by, the, end, of, march, 539, his, starving, soldiers, forced, him, to, accept, the, terms, the, roman, garrison, was, spared, but, the, inhabitants, were, subjected, to, a, massacre, and, the, city, was, razed, after, this, disaster, narses, was, recalled, and, belisarius, confirmed, as, supreme, commander, with, authority, throughout, italy, vitiges, sent, envoys, to, the, persian, court, hoping, to, persuade, khosrow, i, to, reopen, hostilities, with, the, byzantines, to, force, justinian, to, concentrate, the, majority, of, his, forces, including, belisarius, in, the, east, and, allow, the, goths, to, recover, belisarius, resolved, to, conclude, the, war, by, taking, ravenna, but, had, to, deal, with, the, gothic, strongholds, of, auximum, and, faesulae, fiesole, first, while, martin, and, john, hindered, the, gothic, army, under, uraias, which, was, attempting, to, cross, the, river, po, a, part, of, the, army, under, justin, besieged, faesulae, and, belisarius, undertook, the, siege, of, auximum, during, the, sieges, a, large, frankish, army, under, king, theudebert, i, crossed, the, alps, and, came, upon, the, goths, and, the, byzantines, encamped, on, the, two, banks, of, the, po, they, attacked, the, goths, who, thinking, they, had, come, as, allies, were, swiftly, routed, the, equally, astonished, byzantines, also, gave, battle, were, defeated, and, withdrew, southwards, into, tuscany, the, frankish, invasion, was, defeated, by, an, outbreak, of, dysentery, which, caused, great, losses, and, forced, the, franks, to, withdraw, belisarius, concentrated, on, the, besieged, cities, and, both, garrisons, were, forced, by, starvation, to, capitulate, in, october, or, november, 539, troops, from, dalmatia, reinforced, belisarius, and, he, moved, against, ravenna, detachments, moved, north, of, the, po, and, the, imperial, fleet, patrolled, the, adriatic, cutting, the, city, off, from, supplies, inside, the, gothic, capital, vitiges, received, a, frankish, embassy, looking, for, an, alliance, but, after, the, events, of, the, previous, summer, no, trust, was, placed, in, frankish, offers, soon, afterwards, an, embassy, came, from, constantinople, bearing, surprisingly, lenient, terms, from, justinian, anxious, to, finish, the, war, and, concentrate, against, the, impending, persian, war, the, emperor, offered, a, partition, of, italy, the, lands, south, of, the, po, would, be, retained, by, constantinople, those, north, of, the, river, by, the, goths, the, goths, readily, accepted, the, terms, but, belisarius, judging, this, to, be, a, betrayal, of, all, he, had, striven, to, achieve, refused, to, sign, even, though, his, generals, disagreed, with, him, disheartened, the, goths, offered, to, make, belisarius, whom, they, respected, the, western, emperor, belisarius, had, no, intention, of, accepting, the, role, but, saw, how, he, could, use, this, situation, to, his, advantage, and, feigned, acceptance, in, may, 540, belisarius, and, his, army, entered, ravenna, the, city, was, not, looted, while, the, goths, were, well, treated, and, allowed, to, keep, their, properties, in, the, aftermath, of, ravenna, s, surrender, several, gothic, garrisons, north, of, the, po, surrendered, others, remained, in, gothic, hands, among, which, were, ticinum, where, uraias, was, based, and, verona, held, by, ildibad, soon, after, belisarius, sailed, for, constantinople, where, he, was, refused, the, honour, of, a, triumph, vitiges, was, named, a, patrician, and, sent, into, comfortable, retirement, while, the, captive, goths, were, sent, to, reinforce, the, eastern, armies, belisarius, departure, left, most, of, italy, in, roman, hands, but, north, of, the, po, pavia, which, became, the, new, capital, of, the, ostrogothic, kingdom, and, verona, remained, unconquered, soon, after, belisarius, breach, of, faith, towards, them, became, apparent, the, goths, at, the, suggestion, of, uraias, chose, ildibad, as, their, new, king, and, he, re, established, gothic, control, over, venetia, and, liguria, justinian, failed, to, appoint, an, italian, commander, in, chief, the, roman, armies, neglected, military, discipline, and, committed, acts, of, plunder, the, new, imperial, bureaucracy, made, itself, immediately, unpopular, with, its, oppressive, fiscal, demands, ildibad, defeated, the, roman, general, vitalius, at, treviso, but, after, having, uraias, murdered, because, of, a, quarrel, between, their, wives, he, was, assassinated, in, may, 541, in, retribution, the, rugians, remnants, of, odoacer, s, army, who, had, remained, in, italy, and, sided, with, the, goths, proclaimed, one, of, their, own, eraric, as, the, new, king, which, was, unexpectedly, assented, to, by, the, goths, eraric, persuaded, the, goths, to, start, negotiations, with, justinian, secretly, intending, to, hand, over, his, realm, to, the, empire, the, goths, perceived, his, inactivity, for, what, it, was, and, turned, to, ildibad, s, nephew, totila, or, baduila, and, offered, to, make, him, king, totila, had, already, opened, negotiations, with, the, byzantines, but, when, he, was, contacted, by, the, conspirators, he, assented, in, the, early, autumn, of, 541, eraric, was, murdered, and, totila, proclaimed, king, totila, enjoyed, several, advantages, the, outbreak, of, the, plague, of, justinian, devastated, and, depopulated, the, roman, empire, in, 542, the, beginning, of, a, new, roman, persian, war, forced, justinian, to, deploy, most, of, his, troops, in, the, east, and, the, incompetence, and, disunity, of, the, various, roman, generals, in, italy, undermined, military, function, and, discipline, this, last, brought, about, totila, s, first, success, after, much, urging, by, justinian, the, generals, constantinian, and, alexander, combined, their, forces, and, advanced, upon, verona, through, treachery, they, managed, to, capture, a, gate, in, the, city, walls, instead, of, pressing, the, attack, they, delayed, to, quarrel, over, the, prospective, booty, allowing, the, goths, to, recapture, the, gate, and, force, the, byzantines, to, withdraw, totila, attacked, their, camp, near, faventia, faenza, with, 5, 000, men, and, at, the, battle, of, faventia, destroyed, the, roman, army, totila, marched, into, tuscany, where, he, besieged, florence, the, roman, generals, john, bessas, and, cyprian, marched, to, its, relief, but, at, the, battle, of, mucellium, their, numerically, superior, forces, were, defeated, totila, marched, south, where, roman, garrisons, were, few, and, weak, bypassing, rome, the, provinces, of, southern, italy, were, forced, to, recognise, his, authority, this, campaign, was, one, of, rapid, movement, to, take, control, of, the, countryside, leaving, the, byzantines, in, control, of, isolated, strongholds, mostly, on, the, coast, which, could, be, reduced, later, when, a, fortified, location, fell, its, walls, were, usually, razed, so, that, it, would, no, longer, be, of, any, military, value, totila, followed, a, policy, of, treating, his, captives, well, enticing, opponents, to, surrender, rather, than, resist, to, the, end, he, also, tried, to, win, over, the, italian, population, exemplified, by, totila, s, behaviour, during, the, siege, of, naples, where, he, allowed, the, city, to, surrender, on, terms, in, 543, and, displayed, in, the, words, of, j, b, bury, considerable, humanity, in, his, treatment, of, the, defenders, he, nursed, the, famished, citizens, back, to, strength, after, allowing, the, byzantine, garrison, safe, departure, having, captured, naples, totila, attempted, to, broker, a, peace, with, justinian, when, this, was, refused, he, had, copies, of, his, appeal, posted, throughout, rome, despite, the, disfavour, in, which, the, byzantines, were, held, there, was, no, uprising, in, totila, s, favour, which, disgusted, him, he, marched, north, and, besieged, the, city, taking, advantage, of, a, five, year, truce, in, the, east, belisarius, was, sent, back, to, italy, with, 200, ships, in, 544, he, successfully, reoccupied, much, of, southern, italy, but, according, to, procopius, he, was, starved, of, supplies, and, reinforcements, by, a, jealous, justinian, and, so, felt, unable, to, march, to, rome, s, relief, procopius, describes, famine, during, the, siege, in, which, the, ordinary, romans, who, were, not, rich, enough, to, buy, grain, from, the, military, were, reduced, to, eating, bran, nettles, dogs, mice, and, finally, each, other, s, dung, pope, vigilius, who, had, fled, to, the, safety, of, syracuse, sent, a, flotilla, of, grain, ships, but, totila, s, navy, intercepted, them, near, the, mouth, of, the, tiber, and, captured, them, a, desperate, attempt, by, belisarius, to, relieve, rome, came, close, to, success, but, ultimately, failed, according, to, procopius, the, plan, involved, sailing, a, force, up, the, river, tiber, destroying, the, temporary, bridge, and, watchtowers, constructed, by, totila, s, forces, by, dropping, a, boat, filled, with, flammable, materials, onto, a, watchtower, from, a, makeshift, tower, built, on, top, of, two, fastened, skiffs, which, succeeded, afterwards, his, subordinate, isaakes, ordered, to, remain, in, the, city, of, portus, heard, of, his, early, successes, and, took, a, cavalry, force, to, attack, the, gothic, stockade, eager, to, share, the, glory, this, resulted, in, his, capture, and, once, the, news, of, this, reached, belisarius, he, interpreted, the, news, as, portus, had, been, captured, by, the, goths, meaning, he, had, lost, the, only, allied, settlement, close, by, and, that, his, wife, present, in, the, city, was, now, a, hostage, of, the, goths, said, to, have, been, struck, with, a, bout, of, aphasia, he, called, for, a, retreat, to, immediately, retake, portus, only, to, discover, that, it, remained, under, roman, control, after, more, than, a, year, totila, finally, entered, rome, on, 17, december, 546, when, his, men, scaled, the, walls, at, night, and, opened, the, porta, asinaria, procopius, states, that, totila, was, aided, by, some, isaurian, troops, from, the, imperial, garrison, who, had, arranged, a, secret, pact, with, the, goths, rome, was, plundered, and, totila, who, had, expressed, an, intention, to, completely, level, the, city, satisfied, himself, with, tearing, down, about, one, third, of, the, walls, he, then, left, in, pursuit, of, the, byzantine, forces, in, apulia, on, belisarius, absence, during, the, reoccupation, of, rome, by, the, goths, there, are, two, opposing, accounts, procopius, states, that, upon, discovering, his, mistake, regarding, portus, he, was, overcome, with, a, bout, of, depression, and, severe, sickness, which, nearly, resulted, in, his, death, jordanes, on, the, other, hand, claims, that, he, was, recalled, to, rome, due, to, the, death, of, the, empress, theodora, and, cites, his, absence, as, having, emboldened, totila, to, recapture, the, city, belisarius, successfully, reoccupied, rome, four, months, later, in, the, spring, of, 547, and, hastily, rebuilt, the, demolished, sections, of, wall, by, piling, up, the, loose, stones, one, on, top, of, the, other, regardless, of, order, totila, returned, but, was, unable, to, overcome, the, defenders, belisarius, did, not, follow, up, his, advantage, several, cities, including, perugia, were, taken, by, the, goths, while, belisarius, remained, inactive, and, was, then, recalled, from, italy, in, 549, totila, advanced, again, against, rome, he, attempted, to, storm, the, improvised, walls, and, overpower, the, small, garrison, of, 3, 000, men, but, was, beaten, back, he, then, prepared, to, blockade, the, city, and, starve, out, the, defenders, although, the, byzantine, commander, diogenes, had, previously, prepared, large, food, stores, and, had, sown, wheat, fields, within, the, city, walls, however, totila, was, able, to, suborn, part, of, the, garrison, who, opened, the, porta, ostiensis, gate, for, him, totila, s, men, swept, through, the, city, killing, all, but, the, women, who, were, spared, on, the, orders, of, totila, and, looting, what, riches, remained, expecting, the, nobles, and, the, remainder, of, the, garrison, to, flee, as, soon, as, the, walls, were, taken, totila, set, traps, along, the, roads, to, neighboring, towns, that, were, not, yet, under, his, control, and, many, were, killed, while, fleeing, rome, during, 550, 51, the, byzantines, assembled, a, large, expeditionary, force, of, 20, 000, or, 25, 000, men, at, salona, on, the, adriatic, including, regular, byzantine, units, and, a, large, contingent, of, foreign, allies, notably, lombards, heruls, and, bulgars, narses, the, imperial, chamberlain, cubicularius, was, appointed, to, command, in, mid, 551, the, following, spring, narses, led, this, byzantine, army, around, the, coast, of, the, adriatic, to, ancona, and, then, turned, inland, intending, to, march, down, the, via, flaminia, to, rome, near, the, village, of, taginae, the, byzantines, encountered, the, ostrogothic, army, commanded, by, totila, who, had, been, advancing, to, intercept, narses, finding, himself, considerably, outnumbered, totila, ostensibly, entered, into, negotiations, while, planning, a, surprise, attack, but, narses, was, not, fooled, by, the, ruse, and, deployed, his, army, in, a, strong, defensive, position, reinforcements, having, arrived, totila, launched, a, sudden, attack, at, the, battle, of, taginae, with, a, mounted, assault, on, the, byzantine, centre, the, attack, failed, and, by, evening, the, ostrogoths, had, broken, and, fled, totila, was, killed, in, the, rout, the, goths, holding, rome, capitulated, and, at, the, battle, of, mons, lactarius, in, october, 553, narses, defeated, teias, and, the, last, remnants, of, the, gothic, army, in, italy, though, the, ostrogoths, were, defeated, narses, soon, had, to, face, other, barbarians, who, invaded, byzantine, northern, italy, and, southern, gaul, in, early, 553, an, army, of, about, thirty, thousand, franks, and, alemanni, crossed, the, alps, and, took, the, town, of, parma, they, defeated, a, force, under, the, heruli, commander, fulcaris, and, soon, many, goths, from, northern, italy, joined, their, forces, narses, had, dispersed, his, troops, to, garrisons, throughout, central, italy, and, had, wintered, at, rome, after, serious, depredations, throughout, italy, the, barbarians, were, brought, to, battle, by, narses, on, the, banks, of, the, river, volturnus, in, the, battle, of, the, volturnus, the, byzantines, held, off, a, furious, frankish, assault, while, the, byzantine, cavalry, encircled, them, the, franks, and, alemanni, were, all, but, annihilated, seven, thousand, goths, held, out, at, campsa, near, naples, until, capitulating, in, the, spring, of, 555, the, lands, and, cities, across, the, river, po, were, still, held, by, franks, alemanni, and, goths, and, it, was, not, until, 562, that, their, last, strongholds, the, cities, of, verona, and, brixia, were, subjugated, according, to, the, byzantine, historian, procopius, of, caesarea, the, barbarian, population, was, then, allowed, to, live, peacefully, in, italy, under, roman, sovereignty, the, gothic, war, is, often, viewed, as, a, pyrrhic, victory, which, drained, the, byzantine, empire, of, resources, that, might, have, been, employed, against, more, serious, threats, in, western, asia, and, the, balkans, in, the, east, pagan, slavs, and, kutrigurs, raided, and, devastated, the, byzantine, provinces, south, of, the, danube, from, 517, a, century, later, dalmatia, macedonia, thrace, and, most, of, greece, were, lost, to, slavs, and, avars, some, recent, historians, have, taken, a, different, view, of, justinian, s, western, campaigns, warren, treadgold, placed, greater, blame, for, the, vulnerability, of, the, empire, in, the, late, 6th, century, on, the, plague, of, justinian, in, 540, 541, which, is, estimated, to, have, killed, up, to, a, quarter, of, the, population, at, the, height, of, the, gothic, war, sapping, the, empire, of, manpower, and, tax, revenues, needed, to, complete, the, campaign, more, swiftly, no, ruler, no, matter, how, wise, could, possibly, have, anticipated, the, plague, he, argues, which, would, have, been, disastrous, for, the, empire, and, italy, regardless, of, the, attempt, to, reconquer, italy, however, as, a, result, of, rome, having, been, under, attack, constantly, during, the, war, the, deaths, not, caused, by, the, plague, continued, to, rise, in, italy, the, war, devastated, the, urban, society, that, was, supported, by, a, settled, hinterland, the, great, cities, were, abandoned, as, italy, fell, into, a, long, period, of, decline, the, impoverishment, of, italy, and, the, drain, on, the, empire, made, it, impossible, for, the, byzantines, to, hold, their, gains, only, three, years, after, the, death, of, justinian, in, 565, the, mainland, italian, territories, fell, into, the, hands, of, the, germanic, lombards, the, exarchate, of, ravenna, a, band, of, territory, that, stretched, across, central, italy, to, the, tyrrhenian, sea, and, south, to, naples, along, with, parts, of, southern, italy, were, the, only, remaining, imperial, holdings, after, the, gothic, wars, the, empire, would, entertain, no, more, serious, ambitions, in, the, west, rome, remained, under, imperial, control, until, the, exarchate, of, ravenna, was, conquered, by, the, lombards, in, 751, byzantine, influence, persisted, in, some, coastal, areas, of, southern, italy, until, the, late, 11th, century, while, the, interior, was, ruled, by, lombard, dukes, based, at, benevento, and, later, also, at, salerno, and, capua, the, widespread, destruction, of, italy, in, the, war, harsh, gothic, and, byzantine, reprisals, of, their, opponents, supporters, and, heavy, byzantine, taxation, led, the, italian, populace, to, shift, allegiances, instead, of, loyalty, to, empire, their, identities, were, increasingly, tied, to, religion, family, and, city, instead, in, the, long, sweep, of, italian, history, the, unified, italy, of, the, romans, and, later, the, goths, was, broken, up, permanently, this, remained, the, case, until, the, unification, of, italy, in, the, 19th, century
