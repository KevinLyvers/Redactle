radiocarbon, dating, also, referred, to, as, carbon, dating, or, carbon, 14, dating, is, a, method, for, determining, the, age, of, an, object, containing, organic, material, by, using, the, properties, of, radiocarbon, a, radioactive, isotope, of, carbon, the, method, was, developed, in, the, late, 1940s, at, the, university, of, chicago, by, willard, libby, based, on, the, constant, creation, of, radiocarbon, 14, c, in, the, earth, s, atmosphere, by, the, interaction, of, cosmic, rays, with, atmospheric, nitrogen, the, resulting, 14, c, combines, with, atmospheric, oxygen, to, form, radioactive, carbon, dioxide, which, is, incorporated, into, plants, by, photosynthesis, animals, then, acquire, 14, c, by, eating, the, plants, when, the, animal, or, plant, dies, it, stops, exchanging, carbon, with, its, environment, and, thereafter, the, amount, of, 14, c, it, contains, begins, to, decrease, as, the, 14, c, undergoes, radioactive, decay, measuring, the, proportion, of, 14, c, in, a, sample, from, a, dead, plant, or, animal, such, as, a, piece, of, wood, or, a, fragment, of, bone, provides, information, that, can, be, used, to, calculate, when, the, animal, or, plant, died, the, older, a, sample, is, the, less, 14, c, there, is, to, be, detected, and, because, the, half, life, of, 14, c, the, period, of, time, after, which, half, of, a, given, sample, will, have, decayed, is, about, 5, 730, years, the, oldest, dates, that, can, be, reliably, measured, by, this, process, date, to, approximately, 50, 000, years, ago, in, this, interval, about, 99, 8, of, the, 14, c, will, have, decayed, although, special, preparation, methods, occasionally, make, an, accurate, analysis, of, older, samples, possible, in, 1960, libby, received, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, for, his, work, research, has, been, ongoing, since, the, 1960s, to, determine, what, the, proportion, of, 14, c, in, the, atmosphere, has, been, over, the, past, 50, 000, years, the, resulting, data, in, the, form, of, a, calibration, curve, is, now, used, to, convert, a, given, measurement, of, radiocarbon, in, a, sample, into, an, estimate, of, the, sample, s, calendar, age, other, corrections, must, be, made, to, account, for, the, proportion, of, 14, c, in, different, types, of, organisms, fractionation, and, the, varying, levels, of, 14, c, throughout, the, biosphere, reservoir, effects, additional, complications, come, from, the, burning, of, fossil, fuels, such, as, coal, and, oil, and, from, the, above, ground, nuclear, tests, performed, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, because, the, time, it, takes, to, convert, biological, materials, to, fossil, fuels, is, substantially, longer, than, the, time, it, takes, for, its, 14, c, to, decay, below, detectable, levels, fossil, fuels, contain, almost, no, 14, c, as, a, result, beginning, in, the, late, 19th, century, there, was, a, noticeable, drop, in, the, proportion, of, 14, c, in, the, atmosphere, as, the, carbon, dioxide, generated, from, burning, fossil, fuels, began, to, accumulate, conversely, nuclear, testing, increased, the, amount, of, 14, c, in, the, atmosphere, which, reached, a, maximum, in, about, 1965, of, almost, double, the, amount, present, in, the, atmosphere, prior, to, nuclear, testing, measurement, of, radiocarbon, was, originally, done, with, beta, counting, devices, which, counted, the, amount, of, beta, radiation, emitted, by, decaying, 14, c, atoms, in, a, sample, more, recently, accelerator, mass, spectrometry, has, become, the, method, of, choice, it, counts, all, the, 14, c, atoms, in, the, sample, and, not, just, the, few, that, happen, to, decay, during, the, measurements, it, can, therefore, be, used, with, much, smaller, samples, as, small, as, individual, plant, seeds, and, gives, results, much, more, quickly, the, development, of, radiocarbon, dating, has, had, a, profound, impact, on, archaeology, in, addition, to, permitting, more, accurate, dating, within, archaeological, sites, than, previous, methods, it, allows, comparison, of, dates, of, events, across, great, distances, histories, of, archaeology, often, refer, to, its, impact, as, the, radiocarbon, revolution, radiocarbon, dating, has, allowed, key, transitions, in, prehistory, to, be, dated, such, as, the, end, of, the, last, ice, age, and, the, beginning, of, the, neolithic, and, bronze, age, in, different, regions, in, 1939, martin, kamen, and, samuel, ruben, of, the, radiation, laboratory, at, berkeley, began, experiments, to, determine, if, any, of, the, elements, common, in, organic, matter, had, isotopes, with, half, lives, long, enough, to, be, of, value, in, biomedical, research, they, synthesized, 14, c, using, the, laboratory, s, cyclotron, accelerator, and, soon, discovered, that, the, atom, s, half, life, was, far, longer, than, had, been, previously, thought, this, was, followed, by, a, prediction, by, serge, a, korff, then, employed, at, the, franklin, institute, in, philadelphia, that, the, interaction, of, thermal, neutrons, with, 14, n, in, the, upper, atmosphere, would, create, 14, c, it, had, previously, been, thought, that, 14, c, would, be, more, likely, to, be, created, by, deuterons, interacting, with, 13, c, at, some, time, during, world, war, ii, willard, libby, who, was, then, at, berkeley, learned, of, korff, s, research, and, conceived, the, idea, that, it, might, be, possible, to, use, radiocarbon, for, dating, in, 1945, libby, moved, to, the, university, of, chicago, where, he, began, his, work, on, radiocarbon, dating, he, published, a, paper, in, 1946, in, which, he, proposed, that, the, carbon, in, living, matter, might, include, 14, c, as, well, as, non, radioactive, carbon, libby, and, several, collaborators, proceeded, to, experiment, with, methane, collected, from, sewage, works, in, baltimore, and, after, isotopically, enriching, their, samples, they, were, able, to, demonstrate, that, they, contained, 14, c, by, contrast, methane, created, from, petroleum, showed, no, radiocarbon, activity, because, of, its, age, the, results, were, summarized, in, a, paper, in, science, in, 1947, in, which, the, authors, commented, that, their, results, implied, it, would, be, possible, to, date, materials, containing, carbon, of, organic, origin, libby, and, james, arnold, proceeded, to, test, the, radiocarbon, dating, theory, by, analyzing, samples, with, known, ages, for, example, two, samples, taken, from, the, tombs, of, two, egyptian, kings, zoser, and, sneferu, independently, dated, to, 2625, bc, plus, or, minus, 75, years, were, dated, by, radiocarbon, measurement, to, an, average, of, 2800, bc, plus, or, minus, 250, years, these, results, were, published, in, science, in, december, 1949, within, 11, years, of, their, announcement, more, than, 20, radiocarbon, dating, laboratories, had, been, set, up, worldwide, in, 1960, libby, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, for, this, work, in, nature, carbon, exists, as, three, isotopes, carbon, 12, 12, c, and, carbon, 13, 13, c, are, stable, and, nonradioactive, carbon, 14, 14, c, also, known, as, radiocarbon, is, radioactive, the, half, life, of, 14, c, the, time, it, takes, for, half, of, a, given, amount, of, 14, c, to, decay, is, about, 5, 730, years, so, its, concentration, in, the, atmosphere, might, be, expected, to, decrease, over, thousands, of, years, but, 14, c, is, constantly, being, produced, in, the, lower, stratosphere, and, upper, troposphere, primarily, by, galactic, cosmic, rays, and, to, a, lesser, degree, by, solar, cosmic, rays, these, cosmic, rays, generate, neutrons, as, they, travel, through, the, atmosphere, which, can, strike, nitrogen, 14, 14, n, atoms, and, turn, them, into, 14, c, the, following, nuclear, reaction, is, the, main, pathway, by, which, 14, c, is, created, n, 14, 7, n, 14, 6, c, p, where, n, represents, a, neutron, and, p, represents, a, proton, once, produced, the, 14, c, quickly, combines, with, the, oxygen, o, in, the, atmosphere, to, form, first, carbon, monoxide, co, and, ultimately, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, 14, c, o, 2, 14, co, o, 14, co, oh, 14, co, 2, h, carbon, dioxide, produced, in, this, way, diffuses, in, the, atmosphere, is, dissolved, in, the, ocean, and, is, taken, up, by, plants, via, photosynthesis, animals, eat, the, plants, and, ultimately, the, radiocarbon, is, distributed, throughout, the, biosphere, the, ratio, of, 14, c, to, 12, c, is, approximately, 1, 25, parts, of, 14, c, to, 10, 12, parts, of, 12, c, in, addition, about, 1, of, the, carbon, atoms, are, of, the, stable, isotope, 13, c, the, equation, for, the, radioactive, decay, of, 14, c, is, 14, 6, c, 14, 7, n, e, e, by, emitting, a, beta, particle, an, electron, e, and, an, electron, antineutrino, e, one, of, the, neutrons, in, the, 14, c, nucleus, changes, to, a, proton, and, the, 14, c, nucleus, reverts, to, the, stable, non, radioactive, isotope, 14, n, during, its, life, a, plant, or, animal, is, in, equilibrium, with, its, surroundings, by, exchanging, carbon, either, with, the, atmosphere, or, through, its, diet, it, will, therefore, have, the, same, proportion, of, 14, c, as, the, atmosphere, or, in, the, case, of, marine, animals, or, plants, with, the, ocean, once, it, dies, it, ceases, to, acquire, 14, c, but, the, 14, c, within, its, biological, material, at, that, time, will, continue, to, decay, and, so, the, ratio, of, 14, c, to, 12, c, in, its, remains, will, gradually, decrease, because, 14, c, decays, at, a, known, rate, the, proportion, of, radiocarbon, can, be, used, to, determine, how, long, it, has, been, since, a, given, sample, stopped, exchanging, carbon, the, older, the, sample, the, less, 14, c, will, be, left, the, equation, governing, the, decay, of, a, radioactive, isotope, is, n, n, 0, e, t, displaystyle, n, n, 0, e, lambda, t, where, n, 0, is, the, number, of, atoms, of, the, isotope, in, the, original, sample, at, time, t, 0, when, the, organism, from, which, the, sample, was, taken, died, and, n, is, the, number, of, atoms, left, after, time, t, is, a, constant, that, depends, on, the, particular, isotope, for, a, given, isotope, it, is, equal, to, the, reciprocal, of, the, mean, life, i, e, the, average, or, expected, time, a, given, atom, will, survive, before, undergoing, radioactive, decay, the, mean, life, denoted, by, of, 14, c, is, 8, 267, years, so, the, equation, above, can, be, rewritten, as, t, ln, n, 0, n, 8267, years, displaystyle, t, ln, n, 0, n, cdot, text, 8267, years, the, sample, is, assumed, to, have, originally, had, the, same, 14, c, 12, c, ratio, as, the, ratio, in, the, atmosphere, and, since, the, size, of, the, sample, is, known, the, total, number, of, atoms, in, the, sample, can, be, calculated, yielding, n, 0, the, number, of, 14, c, atoms, in, the, original, sample, measurement, of, n, the, number, of, 14, c, atoms, currently, in, the, sample, allows, the, calculation, of, t, the, age, of, the, sample, using, the, equation, above, the, half, life, of, a, radioactive, isotope, usually, denoted, by, t, 1, 2, is, a, more, familiar, concept, than, the, mean, life, so, although, the, equations, above, are, expressed, in, terms, of, the, mean, life, it, is, more, usual, to, quote, the, value, of, 14, c, s, half, life, than, its, mean, life, the, currently, accepted, value, for, the, half, life, of, 14, c, is, 5, 700, 30, years, this, means, that, after, 5, 700, years, only, half, of, the, initial, 14, c, will, remain, a, quarter, will, remain, after, 11, 400, years, an, eighth, after, 17, 100, years, and, so, on, the, above, calculations, make, several, assumptions, such, as, that, the, level, of, 14, c, in, the, atmosphere, has, remained, constant, over, time, in, fact, the, level, of, 14, c, in, the, atmosphere, has, varied, significantly, and, as, a, result, the, values, provided, by, the, equation, above, have, to, be, corrected, by, using, data, from, other, sources, this, is, done, by, calibration, curves, discussed, below, which, convert, a, measurement, of, 14, c, in, a, sample, into, an, estimated, calendar, age, the, calculations, involve, several, steps, and, include, an, intermediate, value, called, the, radiocarbon, age, which, is, the, age, in, radiocarbon, years, of, the, sample, an, age, quoted, in, radiocarbon, years, means, that, no, calibration, curve, has, been, used, the, calculations, for, radiocarbon, years, assume, that, the, atmospheric, 14, c, 12, c, ratio, has, not, changed, over, time, calculating, radiocarbon, ages, also, requires, the, value, of, the, half, life, for, 14, c, in, libby, s, 1949, paper, he, used, a, value, of, 5720, 47, years, based, on, research, by, engelkemeir, et, al, this, was, remarkably, close, to, the, modern, value, but, shortly, afterwards, the, accepted, value, was, revised, to, 5568, 30, years, and, this, value, was, in, use, for, more, than, a, decade, it, was, revised, again, in, the, early, 1960s, to, 5, 730, 40, years, which, meant, that, many, calculated, dates, in, papers, published, prior, to, this, were, incorrect, the, error, in, the, half, life, is, about, 3, for, consistency, with, these, early, papers, it, was, agreed, at, the, 1962, radiocarbon, conference, in, cambridge, uk, to, use, the, libby, half, life, of, 5568, years, radiocarbon, ages, are, still, calculated, using, this, half, life, and, are, known, as, conventional, radiocarbon, age, since, the, calibration, curve, intcal, also, reports, past, atmospheric, 14, c, concentration, using, this, conventional, age, any, conventional, ages, calibrated, against, the, intcal, curve, will, produce, a, correct, calibrated, age, when, a, date, is, quoted, the, reader, should, be, aware, that, if, it, is, an, uncalibrated, date, a, term, used, for, dates, given, in, radiocarbon, years, it, may, differ, substantially, from, the, best, estimate, of, the, actual, calendar, date, both, because, it, uses, the, wrong, value, for, the, half, life, of, 14, c, and, because, no, correction, calibration, has, been, applied, for, the, historical, variation, of, 14, c, in, the, atmosphere, over, time, carbon, is, distributed, throughout, the, atmosphere, the, biosphere, and, the, oceans, these, are, referred, to, collectively, as, the, carbon, exchange, reservoir, and, each, component, is, also, referred, to, individually, as, a, carbon, exchange, reservoir, the, different, elements, of, the, carbon, exchange, reservoir, vary, in, how, much, carbon, they, store, and, in, how, long, it, takes, for, the, 14, c, generated, by, cosmic, rays, to, fully, mix, with, them, this, affects, the, ratio, of, 14, c, to, 12, c, in, the, different, reservoirs, and, hence, the, radiocarbon, ages, of, samples, that, originated, in, each, reservoir, the, atmosphere, which, is, where, 14, c, is, generated, contains, about, 1, 9, of, the, total, carbon, in, the, reservoirs, and, the, 14, c, it, contains, mixes, in, less, than, seven, years, the, ratio, of, 14, c, to, 12, c, in, the, atmosphere, is, taken, as, the, baseline, for, the, other, reservoirs, if, another, reservoir, has, a, lower, ratio, of, 14, c, to, 12, c, it, indicates, that, the, carbon, is, older, and, hence, that, either, some, of, the, 14, c, has, decayed, or, the, reservoir, is, receiving, carbon, that, is, not, at, the, atmospheric, baseline, the, ocean, surface, is, an, example, it, contains, 2, 4, of, the, carbon, in, the, exchange, reservoir, but, there, is, only, about, 95, as, much, 14, c, as, would, be, expected, if, the, ratio, were, the, same, as, in, the, atmosphere, the, time, it, takes, for, carbon, from, the, atmosphere, to, mix, with, the, surface, ocean, is, only, a, few, years, but, the, surface, waters, also, receive, water, from, the, deep, ocean, which, has, more, than, 90, of, the, carbon, in, the, reservoir, water, in, the, deep, ocean, takes, about, 1, 000, years, to, circulate, back, through, surface, waters, and, so, the, surface, waters, contain, a, combination, of, older, water, with, depleted, 14, c, and, water, recently, at, the, surface, with, 14, c, in, equilibrium, with, the, atmosphere, creatures, living, at, the, ocean, surface, have, the, same, 14, c, ratios, as, the, water, they, live, in, and, as, a, result, of, the, reduced, 14, c, 12, c, ratio, the, radiocarbon, age, of, marine, life, is, typically, about, 400, years, organisms, on, land, are, in, closer, equilibrium, with, the, atmosphere, and, have, the, same, 14, c, 12, c, ratio, as, the, atmosphere, these, organisms, contain, about, 1, 3, of, the, carbon, in, the, reservoir, sea, organisms, have, a, mass, of, less, than, 1, of, those, on, land, and, are, not, shown, in, the, diagram, accumulated, dead, organic, matter, of, both, plants, and, animals, exceeds, the, mass, of, the, biosphere, by, a, factor, of, nearly, 3, and, since, this, matter, is, no, longer, exchanging, carbon, with, its, environment, it, has, a, 14, c, 12, c, ratio, lower, than, that, of, the, biosphere, the, variation, in, the, 14, c, 12, c, ratio, in, different, parts, of, the, carbon, exchange, reservoir, means, that, a, straightforward, calculation, of, the, age, of, a, sample, based, on, the, amount, of, 14, c, it, contains, will, often, give, an, incorrect, result, there, are, several, other, possible, sources, of, error, that, need, to, be, considered, the, errors, are, of, four, general, types, in, the, early, years, of, using, the, technique, it, was, understood, that, it, depended, on, the, atmospheric, 14, c, 12, c, ratio, having, remained, the, same, over, the, preceding, few, thousand, years, to, verify, the, accuracy, of, the, method, several, artefacts, that, were, datable, by, other, techniques, were, tested, the, results, of, the, testing, were, in, reasonable, agreement, with, the, true, ages, of, the, objects, over, time, however, discrepancies, began, to, appear, between, the, known, chronology, for, the, oldest, egyptian, dynasties, and, the, radiocarbon, dates, of, egyptian, artefacts, neither, the, pre, existing, egyptian, chronology, nor, the, new, radiocarbon, dating, method, could, be, assumed, to, be, accurate, but, a, third, possibility, was, that, the, 14, c, 12, c, ratio, had, changed, over, time, the, question, was, resolved, by, the, study, of, tree, rings, comparison, of, overlapping, series, of, tree, rings, allowed, the, construction, of, a, continuous, sequence, of, tree, ring, data, that, spanned, 8, 000, years, since, that, time, the, tree, ring, data, series, has, been, extended, to, 13, 900, years, in, the, 1960s, hans, suess, was, able, to, use, the, tree, ring, sequence, to, show, that, the, dates, derived, from, radiocarbon, were, consistent, with, the, dates, assigned, by, egyptologists, this, was, possible, because, although, annual, plants, such, as, corn, have, a, 14, c, 12, c, ratio, that, reflects, the, atmospheric, ratio, at, the, time, they, were, growing, trees, only, add, material, to, their, outermost, tree, ring, in, any, given, year, while, the, inner, tree, rings, do, not, get, their, 14, c, replenished, and, instead, only, lose, 14, c, through, radioactive, decay, hence, each, ring, preserves, a, record, of, the, atmospheric, 14, c, 12, c, ratio, of, the, year, it, grew, in, carbon, dating, the, wood, from, the, tree, rings, themselves, provides, the, check, needed, on, the, atmospheric, 14, c, 12, c, ratio, with, a, sample, of, known, date, and, a, measurement, of, the, value, of, n, the, number, of, atoms, of, 14, c, remaining, in, the, sample, the, carbon, dating, equation, allows, the, calculation, of, n, 0, the, number, of, atoms, of, 14, c, in, the, sample, at, the, time, the, tree, ring, was, formed, and, hence, the, 14, c, 12, c, ratio, in, the, atmosphere, at, that, time, equipped, with, the, results, of, carbon, dating, the, tree, rings, it, became, possible, to, construct, calibration, curves, designed, to, correct, the, errors, caused, by, the, variation, over, time, in, the, 14, c, 12, c, ratio, these, curves, are, described, in, more, detail, below, coal, and, oil, began, to, be, burned, in, large, quantities, during, the, 19th, century, both, are, sufficiently, old, that, they, contain, little, or, no, detectable, 14, c, and, as, a, result, the, co, 2, released, substantially, diluted, the, atmospheric, 14, c, 12, c, ratio, dating, an, object, from, the, early, 20th, century, hence, gives, an, apparent, date, older, than, the, true, date, for, the, same, reason, 14, c, concentrations, in, the, neighbourhood, of, large, cities, are, lower, than, the, atmospheric, average, this, fossil, fuel, effect, also, known, as, the, suess, effect, after, hans, suess, who, first, reported, it, in, 1955, would, only, amount, to, a, reduction, of, 0, 2, in, 14, c, activity, if, the, additional, carbon, from, fossil, fuels, were, distributed, throughout, the, carbon, exchange, reservoir, but, because, of, the, long, delay, in, mixing, with, the, deep, ocean, the, actual, effect, is, a, 3, reduction, a, much, larger, effect, comes, from, above, ground, nuclear, testing, which, released, large, numbers, of, neutrons, into, the, atmosphere, resulting, in, the, creation, of, 14, c, from, about, 1950, until, 1963, when, atmospheric, nuclear, testing, was, banned, it, is, estimated, that, several, tonnes, of, 14, c, were, created, if, all, this, extra, 14, c, had, immediately, been, spread, across, the, entire, carbon, exchange, reservoir, it, would, have, led, to, an, increase, in, the, 14, c, 12, c, ratio, of, only, a, few, per, cent, but, the, immediate, effect, was, to, almost, double, the, amount, of, 14, c, in, the, atmosphere, with, the, peak, level, occurring, in, 1964, for, the, northern, hemisphere, and, in, 1966, for, the, southern, hemisphere, the, level, has, since, dropped, as, this, bomb, pulse, or, bomb, carbon, as, it, is, sometimes, called, percolates, into, the, rest, of, the, reservoir, photosynthesis, is, the, primary, process, by, which, carbon, moves, from, the, atmosphere, into, living, things, in, photosynthetic, pathways, 12, c, is, absorbed, slightly, more, easily, than, 13, c, which, in, turn, is, more, easily, absorbed, than, 14, c, the, differential, uptake, of, the, three, carbon, isotopes, leads, to, 13, c, 12, c, and, 14, c, 12, c, ratios, in, plants, that, differ, from, the, ratios, in, the, atmosphere, this, effect, is, known, as, isotopic, fractionation, to, determine, the, degree, of, fractionation, that, takes, place, in, a, given, plant, the, amounts, of, both, 12, c, and, 13, c, isotopes, are, measured, and, the, resulting, 13, c, 12, c, ratio, is, then, compared, to, a, standard, ratio, known, as, pdb, the, 13, c, 12, c, ratio, is, used, instead, of, 14, c, 12, c, because, the, former, is, much, easier, to, measure, and, the, latter, can, be, easily, derived, the, depletion, of, 13, c, relative, to, 12, c, is, proportional, to, the, difference, in, the, atomic, masses, of, the, two, isotopes, so, the, depletion, for, 14, c, is, twice, the, depletion, of, 13, c, the, fractionation, of, 13, c, known, as, 13, c, is, calculated, as, follows, c, 13, c, 13, c, 12, sample, c, 13, c, 12, standard, 1, 1000, displaystyle, delta, ce, 13, c, left, frac, left, frac, ce, 13, c, ce, 12, c, right, text, sample, left, frac, ce, 13, c, ce, 12, c, right, text, standard, 1, right, times, 1000, where, the, sign, indicates, parts, per, thousand, because, the, pdb, standard, contains, an, unusually, high, proportion, of, 13, c, most, measured, 13, c, values, are, negative, for, marine, organisms, the, details, of, the, photosynthesis, reactions, are, less, well, understood, and, the, 13, c, values, for, marine, photosynthetic, organisms, are, dependent, on, temperature, at, higher, temperatures, co, 2, has, poor, solubility, in, water, which, means, there, is, less, co, 2, available, for, the, photosynthetic, reactions, under, these, conditions, fractionation, is, reduced, and, at, temperatures, above, 14, c, 57, f, the, 13, c, values, are, correspondingly, higher, while, at, lower, temperatures, co, 2, becomes, more, soluble, and, hence, more, available, to, marine, organisms, the, 13, c, value, for, animals, depends, on, their, diet, an, animal, that, eats, food, with, high, 13, c, values, will, have, a, higher, 13, c, than, one, that, eats, food, with, lower, 13, c, values, the, animal, s, own, biochemical, processes, can, also, impact, the, results, for, example, both, bone, minerals, and, bone, collagen, typically, have, a, higher, concentration, of, 13, c, than, is, found, in, the, animal, s, diet, though, for, different, biochemical, reasons, the, enrichment, of, bone, 13, c, also, implies, that, excreted, material, is, depleted, in, 13, c, relative, to, the, diet, since, 13, c, makes, up, about, 1, of, the, carbon, in, a, sample, the, 13, c, 12, c, ratio, can, be, accurately, measured, by, mass, spectrometry, typical, values, of, 13, c, have, been, found, by, experiment, for, many, plants, as, well, as, for, different, parts, of, animals, such, as, bone, collagen, but, when, dating, a, given, sample, it, is, better, to, determine, the, 13, c, value, for, that, sample, directly, than, to, rely, on, the, published, values, the, carbon, exchange, between, atmospheric, co, 2, and, carbonate, at, the, ocean, surface, is, also, subject, to, fractionation, with, 14, c, in, the, atmosphere, more, likely, than, 12, c, to, dissolve, in, the, ocean, the, result, is, an, overall, increase, in, the, 14, c, 12, c, ratio, in, the, ocean, of, 1, 5, relative, to, the, 14, c, 12, c, ratio, in, the, atmosphere, this, increase, in, 14, c, concentration, almost, exactly, cancels, out, the, decrease, caused, by, the, upwelling, of, water, containing, old, and, hence, 14, c, depleted, carbon, from, the, deep, ocean, so, that, direct, measurements, of, 14, c, radiation, are, similar, to, measurements, for, the, rest, of, the, biosphere, correcting, for, isotopic, fractionation, as, is, done, for, all, radiocarbon, dates, to, allow, comparison, between, results, from, different, parts, of, the, biosphere, gives, an, apparent, age, of, about, 400, years, for, ocean, surface, water, libby, s, original, exchange, reservoir, hypothesis, assumed, that, the, 14, c, 12, c, ratio, in, the, exchange, reservoir, is, constant, all, over, the, world, but, it, has, since, been, discovered, that, there, are, several, causes, of, variation, in, the, ratio, across, the, reservoir, the, co, 2, in, the, atmosphere, transfers, to, the, ocean, by, dissolving, in, the, surface, water, as, carbonate, and, bicarbonate, ions, at, the, same, time, the, carbonate, ions, in, the, water, are, returning, to, the, air, as, co, 2, this, exchange, process, brings, 14, c, from, the, atmosphere, into, the, surface, waters, of, the, ocean, but, the, 14, c, thus, introduced, takes, a, long, time, to, percolate, through, the, entire, volume, of, the, ocean, the, deepest, parts, of, the, ocean, mix, very, slowly, with, the, surface, waters, and, the, mixing, is, uneven, the, main, mechanism, that, brings, deep, water, to, the, surface, is, upwelling, which, is, more, common, in, regions, closer, to, the, equator, upwelling, is, also, influenced, by, factors, such, as, the, topography, of, the, local, ocean, bottom, and, coastlines, the, climate, and, wind, patterns, overall, the, mixing, of, deep, and, surface, waters, takes, far, longer, than, the, mixing, of, atmospheric, co, 2, with, the, surface, waters, and, as, a, result, water, from, some, deep, ocean, areas, has, an, apparent, radiocarbon, age, of, several, thousand, years, upwelling, mixes, this, old, water, with, the, surface, water, giving, the, surface, water, an, apparent, age, of, about, several, hundred, years, after, correcting, for, fractionation, this, effect, is, not, uniform, the, average, effect, is, about, 400, years, but, there, are, local, deviations, of, several, hundred, years, for, areas, that, are, geographically, close, to, each, other, these, deviations, can, be, accounted, for, in, calibration, and, users, of, software, such, as, calib, can, provide, as, an, input, the, appropriate, correction, for, the, location, of, their, samples, the, effect, also, applies, to, marine, organisms, such, as, shells, and, marine, mammals, such, as, whales, and, seals, which, have, radiocarbon, ages, that, appear, to, be, hundreds, of, years, old, the, northern, and, southern, hemispheres, have, atmospheric, circulation, systems, that, are, sufficiently, independent, of, each, other, that, there, is, a, noticeable, time, lag, in, mixing, between, the, two, the, atmospheric, 14, c, 12, c, ratio, is, lower, in, the, southern, hemisphere, with, an, apparent, additional, age, of, about, 40, years, for, radiocarbon, results, from, the, south, as, compared, to, the, north, this, is, because, the, greater, surface, area, of, ocean, in, the, southern, hemisphere, means, that, there, is, more, carbon, exchanged, between, the, ocean, and, the, atmosphere, than, in, the, north, since, the, surface, ocean, is, depleted, in, 14, c, because, of, the, marine, effect, 14, c, is, removed, from, the, southern, atmosphere, more, quickly, than, in, the, north, the, effect, is, strengthened, by, strong, upwelling, around, antarctica, if, the, carbon, in, freshwater, is, partly, acquired, from, aged, carbon, such, as, rocks, then, the, result, will, be, a, reduction, in, the, 14, c, 12, c, ratio, in, the, water, for, example, rivers, that, pass, over, limestone, which, is, mostly, composed, of, calcium, carbonate, will, acquire, carbonate, ions, similarly, groundwater, can, contain, carbon, derived, from, the, rocks, through, which, it, has, passed, these, rocks, are, usually, so, old, that, they, no, longer, contain, any, measurable, 14, c, so, this, carbon, lowers, the, 14, c, 12, c, ratio, of, the, water, it, enters, which, can, lead, to, apparent, ages, of, thousands, of, years, for, both, the, affected, water, and, the, plants, and, freshwater, organisms, that, live, in, it, this, is, known, as, the, hard, water, effect, because, it, is, often, associated, with, calcium, ions, which, are, characteristic, of, hard, water, other, sources, of, carbon, such, as, humus, can, produce, similar, results, and, can, also, reduce, the, apparent, age, if, they, are, of, more, recent, origin, than, the, sample, the, effect, varies, greatly, and, there, is, no, general, offset, that, can, be, applied, additional, research, is, usually, needed, to, determine, the, size, of, the, offset, for, example, by, comparing, the, radiocarbon, age, of, deposited, freshwater, shells, with, associated, organic, material, volcanic, eruptions, eject, large, amounts, of, carbon, into, the, air, the, carbon, is, of, geological, origin, and, has, no, detectable, 14, c, so, the, 14, c, 12, c, ratio, in, the, vicinity, of, the, volcano, is, depressed, relative, to, surrounding, areas, dormant, volcanoes, can, also, emit, aged, carbon, plants, that, photosynthesize, this, carbon, also, have, lower, 14, c, 12, c, ratios, for, example, plants, in, the, neighbourhood, of, the, furnas, caldera, in, the, azores, were, found, to, have, apparent, ages, that, ranged, from, 250, years, to, 3320, years, any, addition, of, carbon, to, a, sample, of, a, different, age, will, cause, the, measured, date, to, be, inaccurate, contamination, with, modern, carbon, causes, a, sample, to, appear, to, be, younger, than, it, really, is, the, effect, is, greater, for, older, samples, if, a, sample, that, is, 17, 000, years, old, is, contaminated, so, that, 1, of, the, sample, is, modern, carbon, it, will, appear, to, be, 600, years, younger, for, a, sample, that, is, 34, 000, years, old, the, same, amount, of, contamination, would, cause, an, error, of, 4, 000, years, contamination, with, old, carbon, with, no, remaining, 14, c, causes, an, error, in, the, other, direction, independent, of, age, a, sample, contaminated, with, 1, old, carbon, will, appear, to, be, about, 80, years, older, than, it, truly, is, regardless, of, the, date, of, the, sample, samples, for, dating, need, to, be, converted, into, a, form, suitable, for, measuring, the, 14, c, content, this, can, mean, conversion, to, gaseous, liquid, or, solid, form, depending, on, the, measurement, technique, to, be, used, before, this, can, be, done, the, sample, must, be, treated, to, remove, any, contamination, and, any, unwanted, constituents, this, includes, removing, visible, contaminants, such, as, rootlets, that, may, have, penetrated, the, sample, since, its, burial, alkali, and, acid, washes, can, be, used, to, remove, humic, acid, and, carbonate, contamination, but, care, has, to, be, taken, to, avoid, removing, the, part, of, the, sample, that, contains, the, carbon, to, be, tested, particularly, for, older, samples, it, may, be, useful, to, enrich, the, amount, of, 14, c, in, the, sample, before, testing, this, can, be, done, with, a, thermal, diffusion, column, the, process, takes, about, a, month, and, requires, a, sample, about, ten, times, as, large, as, would, be, needed, otherwise, but, it, allows, more, precise, measurement, of, the, 14, c, 12, c, ratio, in, old, material, and, extends, the, maximum, age, that, can, be, reliably, reported, once, contamination, has, been, removed, samples, must, be, converted, to, a, form, suitable, for, the, measuring, technology, to, be, used, where, gas, is, required, co, 2, is, widely, used, for, samples, to, be, used, in, liquid, scintillation, counters, the, carbon, must, be, in, liquid, form, the, sample, is, typically, converted, to, benzene, for, accelerator, mass, spectrometry, solid, graphite, targets, are, the, most, common, although, gaseous, co, 2, can, also, be, used, the, quantity, of, material, needed, for, testing, depends, on, the, sample, type, and, the, technology, being, used, there, are, two, types, of, testing, technology, detectors, that, record, radioactivity, known, as, beta, counters, and, accelerator, mass, spectrometers, for, beta, counters, a, sample, weighing, at, least, 10, grams, 0, 35, ounces, is, typically, required, accelerator, mass, spectrometry, is, much, more, sensitive, and, samples, containing, as, little, as, 0, 5, milligrams, of, carbon, can, be, used, for, decades, after, libby, performed, the, first, radiocarbon, dating, experiments, the, only, way, to, measure, the, 14, c, in, a, sample, was, to, detect, the, radioactive, decay, of, individual, carbon, atoms, in, this, approach, what, is, measured, is, the, activity, in, number, of, decay, events, per, unit, mass, per, time, period, of, the, sample, this, method, is, also, known, as, beta, counting, because, it, is, the, beta, particles, emitted, by, the, decaying, 14, c, atoms, that, are, detected, in, the, late, 1970s, an, alternative, approach, became, available, directly, counting, the, number, of, 14, c, and, 12, c, atoms, in, a, given, sample, via, accelerator, mass, spectrometry, usually, referred, to, as, ams, ams, counts, the, 14, c, 12, c, ratio, directly, instead, of, the, activity, of, the, sample, but, measurements, of, activity, and, 14, c, 12, c, ratio, can, be, converted, into, each, other, exactly, for, some, time, beta, counting, methods, were, more, accurate, than, ams, but, ams, is, now, more, accurate, and, has, become, the, method, of, choice, for, radiocarbon, measurements, in, addition, to, improved, accuracy, ams, has, two, further, significant, advantages, over, beta, counting, it, can, perform, accurate, testing, on, samples, much, too, small, for, beta, counting, and, it, is, much, faster, an, accuracy, of, 1, can, be, achieved, in, minutes, with, ams, which, is, far, quicker, than, would, be, achievable, with, the, older, technology, libby, s, first, detector, was, a, geiger, counter, of, his, own, design, he, converted, the, carbon, in, his, sample, to, lamp, black, soot, and, coated, the, inner, surface, of, a, cylinder, with, it, this, cylinder, was, inserted, into, the, counter, in, such, a, way, that, the, counting, wire, was, inside, the, sample, cylinder, in, order, that, there, should, be, no, material, between, the, sample, and, the, wire, any, interposing, material, would, have, interfered, with, the, detection, of, radioactivity, since, the, beta, particles, emitted, by, decaying, 14, c, are, so, weak, that, half, are, stopped, by, a, 0, 01, mm, 0, 00039, in, thickness, of, aluminium, libby, s, method, was, soon, superseded, by, gas, proportional, counters, which, were, less, affected, by, bomb, carbon, the, additional, 14, c, created, by, nuclear, weapons, testing, these, counters, record, bursts, of, ionization, caused, by, the, beta, particles, emitted, by, the, decaying, 14, c, atoms, the, bursts, are, proportional, to, the, energy, of, the, particle, so, other, sources, of, ionization, such, as, background, radiation, can, be, identified, and, ignored, the, counters, are, surrounded, by, lead, or, steel, shielding, to, eliminate, background, radiation, and, to, reduce, the, incidence, of, cosmic, rays, in, addition, anticoincidence, detectors, are, used, these, record, events, outside, the, counter, and, any, event, recorded, simultaneously, both, inside, and, outside, the, counter, is, regarded, as, an, extraneous, event, and, ignored, the, other, common, technology, used, for, measuring, 14, c, activity, is, liquid, scintillation, counting, which, was, invented, in, 1950, but, which, had, to, wait, until, the, early, 1960s, when, efficient, methods, of, benzene, synthesis, were, developed, to, become, competitive, with, gas, counting, after, 1970, liquid, counters, became, the, more, common, technology, choice, for, newly, constructed, dating, laboratories, the, counters, work, by, detecting, flashes, of, light, caused, by, the, beta, particles, emitted, by, 14, c, as, they, interact, with, a, fluorescing, agent, added, to, the, benzene, like, gas, counters, liquid, scintillation, counters, require, shielding, and, anticoincidence, counters, for, both, the, gas, proportional, counter, and, liquid, scintillation, counter, what, is, measured, is, the, number, of, beta, particles, detected, in, a, given, time, period, since, the, mass, of, the, sample, is, known, this, can, be, converted, to, a, standard, measure, of, activity, in, units, of, either, counts, per, minute, per, gram, of, carbon, cpm, g, c, or, becquerels, per, kg, bq, kg, c, in, si, units, each, measuring, device, is, also, used, to, measure, the, activity, of, a, blank, sample, a, sample, prepared, from, carbon, old, enough, to, have, no, activity, this, provides, a, value, for, the, background, radiation, which, must, be, subtracted, from, the, measured, activity, of, the, sample, being, dated, to, get, the, activity, attributable, solely, to, that, sample, s, 14, c, in, addition, a, sample, with, a, standard, activity, is, measured, to, provide, a, baseline, for, comparison, ams, counts, the, atoms, of, 14, c, and, 12, c, in, a, given, sample, determining, the, 14, c, 12, c, ratio, directly, the, sample, often, in, the, form, of, graphite, is, made, to, emit, c, ions, carbon, atoms, with, a, single, negative, charge, which, are, injected, into, an, accelerator, the, ions, are, accelerated, and, passed, through, a, stripper, which, removes, several, electrons, so, that, the, ions, emerge, with, a, positive, charge, the, ions, which, may, have, from, 1, to, 4, positive, charges, c, to, c, 4, depending, on, the, accelerator, design, are, then, passed, through, a, magnet, that, curves, their, path, the, heavier, ions, are, curved, less, than, the, lighter, ones, so, the, different, isotopes, emerge, as, separate, streams, of, ions, a, particle, detector, then, records, the, number, of, ions, detected, in, the, 14, c, stream, but, since, the, volume, of, 12, c, and, 13, c, needed, for, calibration, is, too, great, for, individual, ion, detection, counts, are, determined, by, measuring, the, electric, current, created, in, a, faraday, cup, the, large, positive, charge, induced, by, the, stripper, forces, molecules, such, as, 13, ch, which, has, a, weight, close, enough, to, 14, c, to, interfere, with, the, measurements, to, dissociate, so, they, are, not, detected, most, ams, machines, also, measure, the, sample, s, 13, c, for, use, in, calculating, the, sample, s, radiocarbon, age, the, use, of, ams, as, opposed, to, simpler, forms, of, mass, spectrometry, is, necessary, because, of, the, need, to, distinguish, the, carbon, isotopes, from, other, atoms, or, molecules, that, are, very, close, in, mass, such, as, 14, n, and, 13, ch, as, with, beta, counting, both, blank, samples, and, standard, samples, are, used, two, different, kinds, of, blank, may, be, measured, a, sample, of, dead, carbon, that, has, undergone, no, chemical, processing, to, detect, any, machine, background, and, a, sample, known, as, a, process, blank, made, from, dead, carbon, that, is, processed, into, target, material, in, exactly, the, same, way, as, the, sample, which, is, being, dated, any, 14, c, signal, from, the, machine, background, blank, is, likely, to, be, caused, either, by, beams, of, ions, that, have, not, followed, the, expected, path, inside, the, detector, or, by, carbon, hydrides, such, as, 12, ch, 2, or, 13, ch, a, 14, c, signal, from, the, process, blank, measures, the, amount, of, contamination, introduced, during, the, preparation, of, the, sample, these, measurements, are, used, in, the, subsequent, calculation, of, the, age, of, the, sample, the, calculations, to, be, performed, on, the, measurements, taken, depend, on, the, technology, used, since, beta, counters, measure, the, sample, s, radioactivity, whereas, ams, determines, the, ratio, of, the, three, different, carbon, isotopes, in, the, sample, to, determine, the, age, of, a, sample, whose, activity, has, been, measured, by, beta, counting, the, ratio, of, its, activity, to, the, activity, of, the, standard, must, be, found, to, determine, this, a, blank, sample, of, old, or, dead, carbon, is, measured, and, a, sample, of, known, activity, is, measured, the, additional, samples, allow, errors, such, as, background, radiation, and, systematic, errors, in, the, laboratory, setup, to, be, detected, and, corrected, for, the, most, common, standard, sample, material, is, oxalic, acid, such, as, the, hoxii, standard, 1, 000, lb, 450, kg, of, which, was, prepared, by, the, national, institute, of, standards, and, technology, nist, in, 1977, from, french, beet, harvests, the, results, from, ams, testing, are, in, the, form, of, ratios, of, 12, c, 13, c, and, 14, c, which, are, used, to, calculate, fm, the, fraction, modern, this, is, defined, as, the, ratio, between, the, 14, c, 12, c, ratio, in, the, sample, and, the, 14, c, 12, c, ratio, in, modern, carbon, which, is, in, turn, defined, as, the, 14, c, 12, c, ratio, that, would, have, been, measured, in, 1950, had, there, been, no, fossil, fuel, effect, both, beta, counting, and, ams, results, have, to, be, corrected, for, fractionation, this, is, necessary, because, different, materials, of, the, same, age, which, because, of, fractionation, have, naturally, different, 14, c, 12, c, ratios, will, appear, to, be, of, different, ages, because, the, 14, c, 12, c, ratio, is, taken, as, the, indicator, of, age, to, avoid, this, all, radiocarbon, measurements, are, converted, to, the, measurement, that, would, have, been, seen, had, the, sample, been, made, of, wood, which, has, a, known, 13, c, value, of, 25, once, the, corrected, 14, c, 12, c, ratio, is, known, a, radiocarbon, age, is, calculated, using, age, ln, fm, 8033, years, displaystyle, text, age, ln, text, fm, cdot, 8033, text, years, the, calculation, uses, 8, 033, years, the, mean, life, derived, from, libby, s, half, life, of, 5, 568, years, not, 8, 267, years, the, mean, life, derived, from, the, more, accurate, modern, value, of, 5, 730, years, libby, s, value, for, the, half, life, is, used, to, maintain, consistency, with, early, radiocarbon, testing, results, calibration, curves, include, a, correction, for, this, so, the, accuracy, of, final, reported, calendar, ages, is, assured, the, reliability, of, the, results, can, be, improved, by, lengthening, the, testing, time, for, example, if, counting, beta, decays, for, 250, minutes, is, enough, to, give, an, error, of, 80, years, with, 68, confidence, then, doubling, the, counting, time, to, 500, minutes, will, allow, a, sample, with, only, half, as, much, 14, c, to, be, measured, with, the, same, error, term, of, 80, years, radiocarbon, dating, is, generally, limited, to, dating, samples, no, more, than, 50, 000, years, old, as, samples, older, than, that, have, insufficient, 14, c, to, be, measurable, older, dates, have, been, obtained, by, using, special, sample, preparation, techniques, large, samples, and, very, long, measurement, times, these, techniques, can, allow, measurement, of, dates, up, to, 60, 000, and, in, some, cases, up, to, 75, 000, years, before, the, present, radiocarbon, dates, are, generally, presented, with, a, range, of, one, standard, deviation, usually, represented, by, the, greek, letter, sigma, as, 1, on, either, side, of, the, mean, however, a, date, range, of, 1, represents, only, a, 68, confidence, level, so, the, true, age, of, the, object, being, measured, may, lie, outside, the, range, of, dates, quoted, this, was, demonstrated, in, 1970, by, an, experiment, run, by, the, british, museum, radiocarbon, laboratory, in, which, weekly, measurements, were, taken, on, the, same, sample, for, six, months, the, results, varied, widely, though, consistently, with, a, normal, distribution, of, errors, in, the, measurements, and, included, multiple, date, ranges, of, 1, confidence, that, did, not, overlap, with, each, other, the, measurements, included, one, with, a, range, from, about, 4, 250, to, about, 4, 390, years, ago, and, another, with, a, range, from, about, 4, 520, to, about, 4, 690, errors, in, procedure, can, also, lead, to, errors, in, the, results, if, 1, of, the, benzene, in, a, modern, reference, sample, accidentally, evaporates, scintillation, counting, will, give, a, radiocarbon, age, that, is, too, young, by, about, 80, years, the, calculations, given, above, produce, dates, in, radiocarbon, years, i, e, dates, that, represent, the, age, the, sample, would, be, if, the, 14, c, 12, c, ratio, had, been, constant, historically, although, libby, had, pointed, out, as, early, as, 1955, the, possibility, that, this, assumption, was, incorrect, it, was, not, until, discrepancies, began, to, accumulate, between, measured, ages, and, known, historical, dates, for, artefacts, that, it, became, clear, that, a, correction, would, need, to, be, applied, to, radiocarbon, ages, to, obtain, calendar, dates, to, produce, a, curve, that, can, be, used, to, relate, calendar, years, to, radiocarbon, years, a, sequence, of, securely, dated, samples, is, needed, which, can, be, tested, to, determine, their, radiocarbon, age, the, study, of, tree, rings, led, to, the, first, such, sequence, individual, pieces, of, wood, show, characteristic, sequences, of, rings, that, vary, in, thickness, because, of, environmental, factors, such, as, the, amount, of, rainfall, in, a, given, year, these, factors, affect, all, trees, in, an, area, so, examining, tree, ring, sequences, from, old, wood, allows, the, identification, of, overlapping, sequences, in, this, way, an, uninterrupted, sequence, of, tree, rings, can, be, extended, far, into, the, past, the, first, such, published, sequence, based, on, bristlecone, pine, tree, rings, was, created, by, wesley, ferguson, hans, suess, used, this, data, to, publish, the, first, calibration, curve, for, radiocarbon, dating, in, 1967, the, curve, showed, two, types, of, variation, from, the, straight, line, a, long, term, fluctuation, with, a, period, of, about, 9, 000, years, and, a, shorter, term, variation, often, referred, to, as, wiggles, with, a, period, of, decades, suess, said, he, drew, the, line, showing, the, wiggles, by, cosmic, schwung, by, which, he, meant, that, the, variations, were, caused, by, extraterrestrial, forces, it, was, unclear, for, some, time, whether, the, wiggles, were, real, or, not, but, they, are, now, well, established, these, short, term, fluctuations, in, the, calibration, curve, are, now, known, as, de, vries, effects, after, hessel, de, vries, a, calibration, curve, is, used, by, taking, the, radiocarbon, date, reported, by, a, laboratory, and, reading, across, from, that, date, on, the, vertical, axis, of, the, graph, the, point, where, this, horizontal, line, intersects, the, curve, will, give, the, calendar, age, of, the, sample, on, the, horizontal, axis, this, is, the, reverse, of, the, way, the, curve, is, constructed, a, point, on, the, graph, is, derived, from, a, sample, of, known, age, such, as, a, tree, ring, when, it, is, tested, the, resulting, radiocarbon, age, gives, a, data, point, for, the, graph, over, the, next, thirty, years, many, calibration, curves, were, published, using, a, variety, of, methods, and, statistical, approaches, these, were, superseded, by, the, intcal, series, of, curves, beginning, with, intcal98, published, in, 1998, and, updated, in, 2004, 2009, 2013, and, 2020, the, improvements, to, these, curves, are, based, on, new, data, gathered, from, tree, rings, varves, coral, plant, macrofossils, speleothems, and, foraminifera, there, are, separate, curves, for, the, northern, hemisphere, intcal20, and, southern, hemisphere, shcal20, as, they, differ, systematically, because, of, the, hemisphere, effect, the, continuous, sequence, of, tree, ring, dates, for, the, northern, hemisphere, goes, back, to, 13, 910, bp, as, of, 2020, and, this, provides, close, to, annual, dating, for, intcal20, much, of, the, period, reduced, where, there, are, calibration, plateaus, and, increased, when, short, term, 14, c, spikes, due, to, miyake, events, provide, additional, correlation, radiocarbon, dating, earlier, than, the, continuous, tree, ring, sequence, relies, on, correlation, with, more, approximate, records, shcal20, is, based, on, independent, data, where, possible, and, derived, from, the, northern, curve, by, adding, the, average, offset, for, the, southern, hemisphere, where, no, direct, data, was, available, there, is, also, a, separate, marine, calibration, curve, marine20, for, a, set, of, samples, forming, a, sequence, with, a, known, separation, in, time, these, samples, form, a, subset, of, the, calibration, curve, the, sequence, can, be, compared, to, the, calibration, curve, and, the, best, match, to, the, sequence, established, this, wiggle, matching, technique, can, lead, to, more, precise, dating, than, is, possible, with, individual, radiocarbon, dates, wiggle, matching, can, be, used, in, places, where, there, is, a, plateau, on, the, calibration, curve, and, hence, can, provide, a, much, more, accurate, date, than, the, intercept, or, probability, methods, are, able, to, produce, the, technique, is, not, restricted, to, tree, rings, for, example, a, stratified, tephra, sequence, in, new, zealand, believed, to, predate, human, colonization, of, the, islands, has, been, dated, to, 1314, ad, 12, years, by, wiggle, matching, the, wiggles, also, mean, that, reading, a, date, from, a, calibration, curve, can, give, more, than, one, answer, this, occurs, when, the, curve, wiggles, up, and, down, enough, that, the, radiocarbon, age, intercepts, the, curve, in, more, than, one, place, which, may, lead, to, a, radiocarbon, result, being, reported, as, two, separate, age, ranges, corresponding, to, the, two, parts, of, the, curve, that, the, radiocarbon, age, intercepted, bayesian, statistical, techniques, can, be, applied, when, there, are, several, radiocarbon, dates, to, be, calibrated, for, example, if, a, series, of, radiocarbon, dates, is, taken, from, different, levels, in, a, stratigraphic, sequence, bayesian, analysis, can, be, used, to, evaluate, dates, which, are, outliers, and, can, calculate, improved, probability, distributions, based, on, the, prior, information, that, the, sequence, should, be, ordered, in, time, when, bayesian, analysis, was, introduced, its, use, was, limited, by, the, need, to, use, mainframe, computers, to, perform, the, calculations, but, the, technique, has, since, been, implemented, on, programs, available, for, personal, computers, such, as, oxcal, several, formats, for, citing, radiocarbon, results, have, been, used, since, the, first, samples, were, dated, as, of, 2019, the, standard, format, required, by, the, journal, radiocarbon, is, as, follows, uncalibrated, dates, should, be, reported, as, laboratory, c, 14, displaystyle, ce, 14c, year, range, bp, where, for, example, the, uncalibrated, date, utc, 2020, 3510, 60, bp, indicates, that, the, sample, was, tested, by, the, utrecht, van, der, graaff, laboratorium, utc, where, it, has, a, sample, number, of, 2020, and, that, the, uncalibrated, age, is, 3510, years, before, present, 60, years, related, forms, are, sometimes, used, for, example, 2, 3, ka, bp, means, 2, 300, radiocarbon, years, before, present, i, e, 350, bc, and, 14, c, yr, bp, might, be, used, to, distinguish, the, uncalibrated, date, from, a, date, derived, from, another, dating, method, such, as, thermoluminescence, calibrated, 14, c, dates, are, frequently, reported, as, cal, bp, cal, bc, or, cal, ad, again, with, bp, referring, to, the, year, 1950, as, the, zero, date, radiocarbon, gives, two, options, for, reporting, calibrated, dates, a, common, format, is, cal, date, range, confidence, where, for, example, cal, 1220, 1281, ad, 1, means, a, calibrated, date, for, which, the, true, date, lies, between, ad, 1220, and, ad, 1281, with, a, confidence, level, of, 1, sigma, or, approximately, 68, calibrated, dates, can, also, be, expressed, as, bp, instead, of, using, bc, and, ad, the, curve, used, to, calibrate, the, results, should, be, the, latest, available, intcal, curve, calibrated, dates, should, also, identify, any, programs, such, as, oxcal, used, to, perform, the, calibration, in, addition, an, article, in, radiocarbon, in, 2014, about, radiocarbon, date, reporting, conventions, recommends, that, information, should, be, provided, about, sample, treatment, including, the, sample, material, pretreatment, methods, and, quality, control, measurements, that, the, citation, to, the, software, used, for, calibration, should, specify, the, version, number, and, any, options, or, models, used, and, that, the, calibrated, date, should, be, given, with, the, associated, probabilities, for, each, range, a, key, concept, in, interpreting, radiocarbon, dates, is, archaeological, association, what, is, the, true, relationship, between, two, or, more, objects, at, an, archaeological, site, it, frequently, happens, that, a, sample, for, radiocarbon, dating, can, be, taken, directly, from, the, object, of, interest, but, there, are, also, many, cases, where, this, is, not, possible, metal, grave, goods, for, example, cannot, be, radiocarbon, dated, but, they, may, be, found, in, a, grave, with, a, coffin, charcoal, or, other, material, which, can, be, assumed, to, have, been, deposited, at, the, same, time, in, these, cases, a, date, for, the, coffin, or, charcoal, is, indicative, of, the, date, of, deposition, of, the, grave, goods, because, of, the, direct, functional, relationship, between, the, two, there, are, also, cases, where, there, is, no, functional, relationship, but, the, association, is, reasonably, strong, for, example, a, layer, of, charcoal, in, a, rubbish, pit, provides, a, date, which, has, a, relationship, to, the, rubbish, pit, contamination, is, of, particular, concern, when, dating, very, old, material, obtained, from, archaeological, excavations, and, great, care, is, needed, in, the, specimen, selection, and, preparation, in, 2014, thomas, higham, and, co, workers, suggested, that, many, of, the, dates, published, for, neanderthal, artifacts, are, too, recent, because, of, contamination, by, young, carbon, as, a, tree, grows, only, the, outermost, tree, ring, exchanges, carbon, with, its, environment, so, the, age, measured, for, a, wood, sample, depends, on, where, the, sample, is, taken, from, this, means, that, radiocarbon, dates, on, wood, samples, can, be, older, than, the, date, at, which, the, tree, was, felled, in, addition, if, a, piece, of, wood, is, used, for, multiple, purposes, there, may, be, a, significant, delay, between, the, felling, of, the, tree, and, the, final, use, in, the, context, in, which, it, is, found, this, is, often, referred, to, as, the, old, wood, problem, one, example, is, the, bronze, age, trackway, at, withy, bed, copse, in, england, the, trackway, was, built, from, wood, that, had, clearly, been, worked, for, other, purposes, before, being, re, used, in, the, trackway, another, example, is, driftwood, which, may, be, used, as, construction, material, it, is, not, always, possible, to, recognize, re, use, other, materials, can, present, the, same, problem, for, example, bitumen, is, known, to, have, been, used, by, some, neolithic, communities, to, waterproof, baskets, the, bitumen, s, radiocarbon, age, will, be, greater, than, is, measurable, by, the, laboratory, regardless, of, the, actual, age, of, the, context, so, testing, the, basket, material, will, give, a, misleading, age, if, care, is, not, taken, a, separate, issue, related, to, re, use, is, that, of, lengthy, use, or, delayed, deposition, for, example, a, wooden, object, that, remains, in, use, for, a, lengthy, period, will, have, an, apparent, age, greater, than, the, actual, age, of, the, context, in, which, it, is, deposited, archaeology, is, not, the, only, field, to, make, use, of, radiocarbon, dating, radiocarbon, dates, can, also, be, used, in, geology, sedimentology, and, lake, studies, for, example, the, ability, to, date, minute, samples, using, ams, has, meant, that, palaeobotanists, and, palaeoclimatologists, can, use, radiocarbon, dating, directly, on, pollen, purified, from, sediment, sequences, or, on, small, quantities, of, plant, material, or, charcoal, dates, on, organic, material, recovered, from, strata, of, interest, can, be, used, to, correlate, strata, in, different, locations, that, appear, to, be, similar, on, geological, grounds, dating, material, from, one, location, gives, date, information, about, the, other, location, and, the, dates, are, also, used, to, place, strata, in, the, overall, geological, timeline, radiocarbon, is, also, used, to, date, carbon, released, from, ecosystems, particularly, to, monitor, the, release, of, old, carbon, that, was, previously, stored, in, soils, as, a, result, of, human, disturbance, or, climate, change, recent, advances, in, field, collection, techniques, also, allow, the, radiocarbon, dating, of, methane, and, carbon, dioxide, which, are, important, greenhouse, gases, the, pleistocene, is, a, geological, epoch, that, began, about, 2, 6, million, years, ago, the, holocene, the, current, geological, epoch, begins, about, 11, 700, years, ago, when, the, pleistocene, ends, establishing, the, date, of, this, boundary, which, is, defined, by, sharp, climatic, warming, as, accurately, as, possible, has, been, a, goal, of, geologists, for, much, of, the, 20th, century, at, two, creeks, in, wisconsin, a, fossil, forest, was, discovered, two, creeks, buried, forest, state, natural, area, and, subsequent, research, determined, that, the, destruction, of, the, forest, was, caused, by, the, valders, ice, readvance, the, last, southward, movement, of, ice, before, the, end, of, the, pleistocene, in, that, area, before, the, advent, of, radiocarbon, dating, the, fossilized, trees, had, been, dated, by, correlating, sequences, of, annually, deposited, layers, of, sediment, at, two, creeks, with, sequences, in, scandinavia, this, led, to, estimates, that, the, trees, were, between, 24, 000, and, 19, 000, years, old, and, hence, this, was, taken, to, be, the, date, of, the, last, advance, of, the, wisconsin, glaciation, before, its, final, retreat, marked, the, end, of, the, pleistocene, in, north, america, in, 1952, libby, published, radiocarbon, dates, for, several, samples, from, the, two, creeks, site, and, two, similar, sites, nearby, the, dates, were, averaged, to, 11, 404, bp, with, a, standard, error, of, 350, years, this, result, was, uncalibrated, as, the, need, for, calibration, of, radiocarbon, ages, was, not, yet, understood, further, results, over, the, next, decade, supported, an, average, date, of, 11, 350, bp, with, the, results, thought, to, be, the, most, accurate, averaging, 11, 600, bp, there, was, initial, resistance, to, these, results, on, the, part, of, ernst, antevs, the, palaeobotanist, who, had, worked, on, the, scandinavian, varve, series, but, his, objections, were, eventually, discounted, by, other, geologists, in, the, 1990s, samples, were, tested, with, ams, yielding, uncalibrated, dates, ranging, from, 11, 640, bp, to, 11, 800, bp, both, with, a, standard, error, of, 160, years, subsequently, a, sample, from, the, fossil, forest, was, used, in, an, interlaboratory, test, with, results, provided, by, over, 70, laboratories, these, tests, produced, a, median, age, of, 11, 788, 8, bp, 2, confidence, which, when, calibrated, gives, a, date, range, of, 13, 730, to, 13, 550, cal, bp, the, two, creeks, radiocarbon, dates, are, now, regarded, as, a, key, result, in, developing, the, modern, understanding, of, north, american, glaciation, at, the, end, of, the, pleistocene, in, 1947, scrolls, were, discovered, in, caves, near, the, dead, sea, that, proved, to, contain, writing, in, hebrew, and, aramaic, most, of, which, are, thought, to, have, been, produced, by, the, essenes, a, small, jewish, sect, these, scrolls, are, of, great, significance, in, the, study, of, biblical, texts, because, many, of, them, contain, the, earliest, known, version, of, books, of, the, hebrew, bible, a, sample, of, the, linen, wrapping, from, one, of, these, scrolls, the, great, isaiah, scroll, was, included, in, a, 1955, analysis, by, libby, with, an, estimated, age, of, 1, 917, 200, years, based, on, an, analysis, of, the, writing, style, palaeographic, estimates, were, made, of, the, age, of, 21, of, the, scrolls, and, samples, from, most, of, these, along, with, other, scrolls, which, had, not, been, palaeographically, dated, were, tested, by, two, ams, laboratories, in, the, 1990s, the, results, ranged, in, age, from, the, early, 4th, century, bc, to, the, mid, 4th, century, ad, in, all, but, two, cases, the, scrolls, were, determined, to, be, within, 100, years, of, the, palaeographically, determined, age, the, isaiah, scroll, was, included, in, the, testing, and, was, found, to, have, two, possible, date, ranges, at, a, 2, confidence, level, because, of, the, shape, of, the, calibration, curve, at, that, point, there, is, a, 15, chance, that, it, dates, from, 355, to, 295, bc, and, an, 84, chance, that, it, dates, from, 210, to, 45, bc, subsequently, these, dates, were, criticized, on, the, grounds, that, before, the, scrolls, were, tested, they, had, been, treated, with, modern, castor, oil, in, order, to, make, the, writing, easier, to, read, it, was, argued, that, failure, to, remove, the, castor, oil, sufficiently, would, have, caused, the, dates, to, be, too, young, multiple, papers, have, been, published, both, supporting, and, opposing, the, criticism, soon, after, the, publication, of, libby, s, 1949, paper, in, science, universities, around, the, world, began, establishing, radiocarbon, dating, laboratories, and, by, the, end, of, the, 1950s, there, were, more, than, 20, active, 14, c, research, laboratories, it, quickly, became, apparent, that, the, principles, of, radiocarbon, dating, were, valid, despite, certain, discrepancies, the, causes, of, which, then, remained, unknown, the, development, of, radiocarbon, dating, has, had, a, profound, impact, on, archaeology, often, described, as, the, radiocarbon, revolution, in, the, words, of, anthropologist, r, e, taylor, 14, c, data, made, a, world, prehistory, possible, by, contributing, a, time, scale, that, transcends, local, regional, and, continental, boundaries, it, provides, more, accurate, dating, within, sites, than, previous, methods, which, usually, derived, either, from, stratigraphy, or, from, typologies, e, g, of, stone, tools, or, pottery, it, also, allows, comparison, and, synchronization, of, events, across, great, distances, the, advent, of, radiocarbon, dating, may, even, have, led, to, better, field, methods, in, archaeology, since, better, data, recording, leads, to, a, firmer, association, of, objects, with, the, samples, to, be, tested, these, improved, field, methods, were, sometimes, motivated, by, attempts, to, prove, that, a, 14, c, date, was, incorrect, taylor, also, suggests, that, the, availability, of, definite, date, information, freed, archaeologists, from, the, need, to, focus, so, much, of, their, energy, on, determining, the, dates, of, their, finds, and, led, to, an, expansion, of, the, questions, archaeologists, were, willing, to, research, for, example, from, the, 1970s, questions, about, the, evolution, of, human, behaviour, were, much, more, frequently, seen, in, archaeology, the, dating, framework, provided, by, radiocarbon, led, to, a, change, in, the, prevailing, view, of, how, innovations, spread, through, prehistoric, europe, researchers, had, previously, thought, that, many, ideas, spread, by, diffusion, through, the, continent, or, by, invasions, of, peoples, bringing, new, cultural, ideas, with, them, as, radiocarbon, dates, began, to, prove, these, ideas, wrong, in, many, instances, it, became, apparent, that, these, innovations, must, sometimes, have, arisen, locally, this, has, been, described, as, a, second, radiocarbon, revolution, more, broadly, the, success, of, radiocarbon, dating, stimulated, interest, in, analytical, and, statistical, approaches, to, archaeological, data, taylor, has, also, described, the, impact, of, ams, and, the, ability, to, obtain, accurate, measurements, from, very, small, samples, as, ushering, in, a, third, radiocarbon, revolution, occasionally, radiocarbon, dating, techniques, date, an, object, of, popular, interest, for, example, the, shroud, of, turin, a, piece, of, linen, cloth, thought, by, some, to, bear, an, image, of, jesus, christ, after, his, crucifixion, three, separate, laboratories, dated, samples, of, linen, from, the, shroud, in, 1988, the, results, pointed, to, 14th, century, origins, raising, doubts, about, the, shroud, s, authenticity, as, an, alleged, 1st, century, relic, researchers, have, studied, other, isotopes, created, by, cosmic, rays, to, determine, if, they, could, also, be, used, to, assist, in, dating, objects, of, archaeological, interest, such, isotopes, include, 3, he, 10, be, 21, ne, 26, al, and, 36, cl, with, the, development, of, ams, in, the, 1980s, it, became, possible, to, measure, these, isotopes, precisely, enough, for, them, to, be, the, basis, of, useful, dating, techniques, which, have, been, primarily, applied, to, dating, rocks, naturally, occurring, radioactive, isotopes, can, also, form, the, basis, of, dating, methods, as, with, potassium, argon, dating, argon, argon, dating, and, uranium, series, dating, other, dating, techniques, of, interest, to, archaeologists, include, thermoluminescence, optically, stimulated, luminescence, electron, spin, resonance, and, fission, track, dating, as, well, as, techniques, that, depend, on, annual, bands, or, layers, such, as, dendrochronology, tephrochronology, and, varve, chronology, this, article, was, submitted, to, wikijournal, of, science, for, external, academic, peer, review, in, 2017, reviewer, reports, the,
