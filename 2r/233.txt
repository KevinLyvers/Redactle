increasing, inclusion, of, non, arab, muslims, in, the, ummah, muslim, community, despite, this, initial, cooperation, the, abbasids, of, the, late, 8th, century, had, alienated, both, non, arab, mawali, clients, the, political, power, of, the, caliphs, was, limited, with, the, rise, of, the, iranian, buyids, and, the, seljuq, turks, who, captured, baghdad, in, 945, and, 1055, respectively, although, abbasid, leadership, over, the, vast, islamic, empire, was, gradually, reduced, to, a, ceremonial, religious, function, in, much, of, the, caliphate, the, dynasty, retained, control, of, its, mesopotamian, domain, during, the, rule, of, caliph, al, muqtafi, and, extended, into, iran, during, the, reign, of, caliph, al, nasir, the, abbasids, age, of, cultural, revival, and, fruition, ended, in, 1258, with, the, siege, of, baghdad, by, the, mongols, under, hulagu, khan, and, the, execution, of, al, musta, sim, the, abbasid, line, of, rulers, re, centred, themselves, in, the,

few, years, after, the, ottoman, conquest, of, egypt, in, 1517, with, the, last, abbasid, caliph, being, al, mutawakkil, iii, the, abbasid, caliphs, were, descended, from, abbas, ibn, abd, al, muttalib, one, of, the, youngest, uncles, of, muhammad, and, of, the, same, banu, hashim, clan, the, abbasids, claimed, to, be, the, true, successors, of, muhammad, in, replacing, the, umayyad, descendants, of, banu, umayya, by, virtue, of, their, closer, bloodline, to, muhammad, the, abbasids, also, distinguished, themselves, from, the, umayyads, by, attacking, their, moral, character, and, administration, in, general, according, to, ira, lapidus, the, abbasid, revolt, was, supported, largely, by, arabs, mainly, the, aggrieved, settlers, of, merv, with, the, addition, of, the, yemeni, faction, and, their, mawali, the, abbasids, also, appealed, to, non, arab, muslims, known, as, mawali, who, remained, outside, the, kinship, based, society, of, the, arabs, and, were, perceived, as, a, lower, class, within, the, umayyad, empire, muhammad, ibn, ali, a, great, grandson, of, abbas, began, to, campaign, in, persia, for, the, return, of, power, to, the, family, of, muhammad, the, hashemites, during, the, reign, of, umar, ii, during, the, reign, of, marwan, ii, this, opposition, culminated, in, the, rebellion, of, ibrahim, al, imam, the, fourth, in, descent, from, abbas, supported, by, the, province, of, khorasan, eastern, persia, even, though, the, governor, opposed, them, and, the, shia, arabs, he, achieved, considerable, success, but, was, captured, in, the, year, 747, and, died, possibly, assassinated, in, prison, on, 9, june, 747, 15, ramadan, ah, 129, abu, muslim, rising, from, khorasan, successfully, initiated, an, open, revolt, against, umayyad, rule, which, was, carried, out, under, the, sign, of, the, black, standard, close, to, 10, 000, soldiers, were, under, abu, muslim, s, command, when, the, hostilities, officially, began, in, merv, general, qahtaba, followed, the, fleeing, governor, nasr, ibn, sayyar, west, defeating, the, umayyads, at, the, battle, of, gorgan, the, battle, of, nahavand, and, finally, in, the, battle, of, karbala, all, in, the, year, 748, ibrahim, was, captured, by, marwan, and, was, killed, the, quarrel, was, taken, up, by, ibrahim, s, brother, abdallah, known, by, the, name, of, abu, al, abbas, as, saffah, who, defeated, the, umayyads, in, 750, in, the, battle, near, the, great, zab, and, was, subsequently, proclaimed, caliph, after, this, loss, marwan, fled, to, egypt, where, he, was, subsequently, killed, the, remainder, of, his, family, barring, one, male, were, also, eliminated, immediately, after, their, victory, al, saffah, sent, his, forces, to, central, asia, where, his, forces, fought, against, tang, expansion, during, the, battle, of, talas, al, saffah, focused, on, putting, down, numerous, rebellions, in, syria, and, mesopotamia, the, byzantines, conducted, raids, during, these, early, distractions, one, of, the, first, major, changes, effected, by, abbasid, rule, was, the, move, of, the, caliphate, s, center, of, power, from, syria, to, mesopotamia, present, day, iraq, this, was, closer, to, the, persian, mawali, support, base, of, the, abbasids, and, the, move, addressed, their, demand, for, reduced, arab, dominance, in, the, empire, however, no, definitive, capital, was, yet, selected, in, these, early, abbasid, years, kufa, generally, served, as, the, administrative, capital, but, the, caliphs, were, wary, of, the, alid, sympathies, in, the, city, and, did, not, always, reside, here, in, 752, al, saffah, built, a, new, city, called, al, hashimiyya, at, an, uncertain, location, most, likely, near, kufa, later, that, same, year, he, moved, to, anbar, where, he, built, a, new, settlement, for, his, khurasani, soldiers, and, a, palace, for, himself, it, was, al, saffah, s, successor, abu, ja, far, al, mansur, r, 754, 775, who, firmly, consolidated, abbasid, rule, and, faced, down, internal, challenges, his, uncle, abdallah, ibn, ali, the, victor, over, the, umayyads, at, the, battle, of, the, zab, was, the, most, serious, potential, rival, for, leadership, and, al, mansur, sent, abu, muslim, the, khurasani, revolutionary, commander, against, him, in, 754, after, abu, muslim, successfully, defeated, him, al, mansur, then, turned, to, eliminate, abu, muslim, himself, he, arranged, to, have, him, arrested, and, executed, in, 755, on, the, western, frontier, the, abbasids, were, unable, to, re, assert, caliphal, control, over, the, western, and, central, maghreb, which, the, umayyads, had, lost, in, the, 740s, one, member, of, the, umayyad, dynasty, abd, ar, rahman, also, managed, to, escape, the, purge, of, his, family, and, managed, to, establish, independent, in, rule, in, al, andalus, present, day, spain, and, portugal, in, 756, founding, the, umayyad, emirate, of, c, rdoba, in, 756, al, mansur, had, also, sent, over, 4, 000, arab, mercenaries, to, assist, the, chinese, tang, dynasty, in, the, an, lushan, rebellion, against, an, lushan, the, abbasids, or, black, flags, as, they, were, commonly, called, were, known, in, tang, dynasty, chronicles, as, the, h, iy, d, sh, the, black, robed, tazi, tazi, being, a, borrowing, from, persian, t, z, the, word, for, arab, al, rashid, sent, embassies, to, the, chinese, tang, dynasty, and, established, good, relations, with, them, after, the, war, these, embassies, remained, in, china, with, caliph, harun, al, rashid, establishing, an, alliance, with, china, several, embassies, from, the, abbasid, caliphs, to, the, chinese, court, have, been, recorded, in, the, old, book, of, tang, the, most, important, being, those, of, al, saffah, al, mansur, and, harun, al, rashid, in, 762, al, mansur, suppressed, a, rebellion, in, the, hejaz, led, by, al, nafs, al, zakiyya, a, descendant, from, ali, ibn, abi, talib, whose, challenge, to, the, abbasid, claim, to, leadership, was, based, on, his, alid, lineage, and, thus, presented, a, serious, political, threat, he, was, defeated, by, an, abbasid, army, led, by, isa, ibn, musa, it, was, after, this, victory, in, 762, that, al, mansur, finally, established, a, proper, abbasid, capital, baghdad, officially, called, madinat, al, salam, city, of, peace, located, on, the, tigris, river, prior, to, this, he, had, continued, to, consider, multiple, sites, for, a, capital, including, al, hashimiyya, which, he, used, as, a, capital, for, a, while, various, other, sites, in, the, region, also, appear, to, have, served, as, capitals, under, either, al, saffah, or, al, mansur, prior, to, the, founding, of, baghdad, al, mansur, centralised, the, judicial, administration, and, later, harun, al, rashid, established, the, institution, of, chief, qadi, to, oversee, it, the, umayyad, empire, was, mostly, arab, however, the, abbasids, progressively, became, made, up, of, more, and, more, converted, muslims, in, which, the, arabs, were, only, one, of, many, ethnicities, the, abbasids, had, depended, heavily, on, the, support, of, persians, in, their, overthrow, of, the, umayyads, al, mansur, welcomed, non, arab, muslims, to, his, court, while, this, helped, integrate, arab, and, persian, cultures, it, alienated, many, of, their, arab, supporters, particularly, the, khorasanian, arabs, who, had, supported, them, in, their, battles, against, the, umayyads, the, abbasid, leadership, had, to, work, hard, in, the, last, half, of, the, 8th, century, 750, 800, under, several, competent, caliphs, and, their, viziers, to, usher, in, the, administrative, changes, needed, to, keep, order, of, the, political, challenges, created, by, the, far, flung, nature, of, the, empire, and, the, limited, communication, across, it, it, was, also, during, this, early, period, of, the, dynasty, in, particular, during, the, governance, of, al, mansur, harun, al, rashid, and, al, ma, mun, that, its, reputation, and, power, were, created, the, position, of, wazir, vizier, developed, in, this, period, it, was, initially, akin, to, a, secretary, but, under, the, tenure, of, the, barmakids, an, iranian, family, close, to, the, abbasids, the, position, became, powerful, and, harun, al, rashid, delegated, state, affairs, to, them, for, many, years, this, resulted, in, a, more, ceremonial, role, for, many, abbasid, caliphs, relative, to, their, time, under, the, umayyads, the, viziers, began, to, exert, greater, influence, and, the, role, of, the, former, arab, aristocracy, was, slowly, replaced, by, a, persian, bureaucracy, to, the, west, harun, al, rashid, agreed, to, grant, the, province, of, ifriqiya, centered, in, present, day, tunisia, as, a, hereditary, emirate, to, ibrahim, ibn, al, aghlab, who, founded, the, aghlabid, dynasty, there, al, mahdi, restarted, the, fighting, with, the, byzantines, and, his, sons, continued, the, conflict, until, empress, irene, pushed, for, peace, after, several, years, of, peace, nikephoros, i, broke, the, treaty, then, fended, off, multiple, incursions, during, the, first, decade, of, the, 9th, century, these, attacks, pushed, into, the, taurus, mountains, culminating, with, a, victory, at, the, battle, of, krasos, and, the, massive, invasion, of, 806, led, by, rashid, himself, rashid, s, navy, also, proved, successful, taking, cyprus, rashid, decided, to, focus, on, the, rebellion, of, rafi, ibn, al, layth, in, khorasan, and, died, while, there, military, operations, by, the, caliphate, were, minimal, while, the, byzantine, empire, was, fighting, abbasid, rule, in, syria, and, anatolia, with, focus, shifting, primarily, to, internal, matters, abbasid, governors, exerted, greater, autonomy, and, using, this, increasing, power, began, to, make, their, positions, hereditary, while, baghdad, remained, the, official, capital, harun, al, rashid, chose, to, reside, in, raqqa, from, 796, until, the, end, of, his, reign, in, 803, for, reasons, that, remain, unclear, harun, al, rashid, turned, on, and, imprisoned, or, killed, most, of, the, barmakids, who, had, wielded, administrative, power, on, his, behalf, during, the, same, period, several, factions, began, either, to, leave, the, empire, for, other, lands, or, to, take, control, of, distant, parts, of, the, empire, still, the, reigns, of, al, rashid, and, his, sons, were, considered, to, be, the, apex, of, the, abbasids, domestically, harun, pursued, policies, similar, to, those, of, his, father, al, mahdi, he, released, many, of, the, umayyads, and, alids, his, brother, al, hadi, had, imprisoned, and, declared, amnesty, for, all, political, groups, of, the, quraysh, large, scale, hostilities, broke, out, with, byzantium, and, under, his, rule, the, abbasid, empire, reached, its, peak, however, harun, s, decision, to, split, the, succession, proved, to, be, damaging, to, the, longevity, of, the, empire, after, rashid, s, death, the, empire, was, split, by, a, civil, war, between, the, caliph, al, amin, and, his, brother, al, ma, mun, who, had, the, support, of, khorasan, this, war, ended, with, a, two, year, siege, of, baghdad, and, the, eventual, death, of, al, amin, in, 813, al, ma, mun, ruled, for, 20, years, of, relative, calm, interspersed, with, a, rebellion, in, azerbaijan, by, the, khurramites, which, was, supported, by, the, byzantines, al, ma, mun, was, also, responsible, for, the, creation, of, an, autonomous, khorasan, and, the, continued, repulsing, of, byzantine, forays, in, the, 9th, century, the, abbasids, created, an, army, loyal, only, to, their, caliphate, composed, of, non, arab, origin, people, known, as, mamluks, this, force, created, by, al, ma, mun, and, his, brother, and, successor, al, mu, tasim, 833, 842, prevented, the, further, disintegration, of, the, empire, the, mamluk, army, though, often, viewed, negatively, both, helped, and, hurt, the, caliphate, early, on, it, provided, the, government, with, a, stable, force, to, address, domestic, and, foreign, problems, however, creation, of, this, foreign, army, and, al, mu, tasim, s, transfer, of, the, capital, from, baghdad, to, samarra, created, a, division, between, the, caliphate, and, the, people, they, claimed, to, rule, al, mu, tasim, s, reign, marked, the, end, of, the, strong, caliphs, he, strengthened, his, personal, army, with, the, mamluks, and, promptly, restarted, the, war, with, the, byzantines, though, his, attempt, to, seize, constantinople, failed, when, his, fleet, was, destroyed, by, a, storm, his, military, excursions, were, generally, successful, culminating, with, a, resounding, victory, in, the, sack, of, amorium, the, byzantines, responded, by, sacking, damietta, in, egypt, and, al, mutawakkil, responded, by, sending, his, troops, into, anatolia, again, sacking, and, marauding, until, they, were, eventually, annihilated, in, 863, even, by, 820, the, samanids, had, begun, the, process, of, exercising, independent, authority, in, transoxiana, and, greater, khorasan, and, the, succeeding, saffarid, dynasty, of, iran, the, saffarids, from, khorasan, nearly, seized, baghdad, in, 876, and, the, tulunids, took, control, of, most, of, syria, the, trend, of, weakening, of, the, central, power, and, strengthening, of, the, minor, caliphates, on, the, periphery, continued, an, exception, was, the, 10, year, period, of, al, mu, tadid, s, rule, r, 892, 902, he, brought, parts, of, egypt, syria, and, khorasan, back, into, abbasid, control, especially, after, the, anarchy, at, samarra, 861, 870, the, abbasid, central, government, was, weakened, and, centrifugal, tendencies, became, more, prominent, in, the, caliphate, s, provinces, by, the, early, 10th, century, the, abbasids, almost, lost, control, of, iraq, to, various, emirs, and, the, caliph, al, radi, 934, 941, was, forced, to, acknowledge, their, power, by, creating, the, position, of, prince, of, princes, amir, al, umara, in, addition, the, power, of, the, mamluks, steadily, grew, reaching, a, climax, when, al, radi, was, constrained, to, hand, over, most, of, the, royal, functions, to, the, non, arab, muhammad, ibn, ra, iq, al, mustakfi, had, a, short, reign, from, 944, to, 946, and, it, was, during, this, period, that, the, persian, faction, known, as, the, buyids, from, daylam, swept, into, power, and, assumed, control, over, the, bureaucracy, in, baghdad, according, to, the, history, of, miskawayh, they, began, distributing, iqtas, fiefs, in, the, form, of, tax, farms, to, their, supporters, this, period, of, localized, secular, control, was, to, last, nearly, 100, years, the, loss, of, abbasid, power, to, the, buyids, would, shift, as, the, seljuks, would, take, over, from, the, persians, at, the, end, of, the, eighth, century, the, abbasids, found, they, could, no, longer, keep, together, a, polity, from, baghdad, which, had, grown, larger, than, that, of, rome, in, 793, the, zaydi, shia, dynasty, of, idrisids, set, up, a, state, from, fez, in, morocco, while, a, family, of, governors, under, the, abbasids, became, increasingly, independent, until, they, founded, the, aghlabid, emirate, from, the, 830s, al, mu, tasim, started, the, downward, slide, by, using, non, muslim, mercenaries, in, his, personal, army, also, during, this, period, officers, started, assassinating, superiors, with, whom, they, disagreed, in, particular, the, caliphs, by, the, 870s, egypt, became, autonomous, under, ahmad, ibn, tulun, in, the, east, governors, decreased, their, ties, to, the, center, as, well, the, saffarids, of, herat, and, the, samanids, of, bukhara, began, breaking, away, around, this, time, cultivating, a, much, more, persianate, culture, and, statecraft, only, the, central, lands, of, mesopotamia, were, under, direct, abbasid, control, with, palestine, and, the, hejaz, often, managed, by, the, tulunids, byzantium, for, its, part, had, begun, to, push, arab, muslims, farther, east, in, anatolia, by, the, 920s, north, africa, was, lost, to, the, fatimid, dynasty, a, shia, sect, tracing, its, roots, to, muhammad, s, daughter, fatimah, the, fatimid, dynasty, took, control, of, idrisid, and, aghlabid, domains, advanced, to, egypt, in, 969, and, established, their, capital, near, fustat, in, cairo, which, they, built, as, a, bastion, of, shia, learning, and, politics, by, 1000, they, had, become, the, chief, political, and, ideological, challenge, to, sunni, islam, and, the, abbasids, who, by, this, time, had, fragmented, into, several, governorships, that, while, recognizing, caliphal, authority, from, baghdad, remained, mostly, autonomous, the, caliph, himself, was, under, protection, of, the, buyid, emirs, who, possessed, all, of, iraq, and, western, iran, and, were, quietly, shia, in, their, sympathies, outside, iraq, all, the, autonomous, provinces, slowly, took, on, the, characteristic, of, de, facto, states, with, hereditary, rulers, armies, and, revenues, and, operated, under, only, nominal, caliph, suzerainty, which, may, not, necessarily, be, reflected, by, any, contribution, to, the, treasury, such, as, the, soomro, emirs, that, had, gained, control, of, sindh, and, ruled, the, entire, province, from, their, capital, of, mansura, mahmud, of, ghazni, took, the, title, of, sultan, as, opposed, to, the, amir, that, had, been, in, more, common, usage, signifying, the, ghaznavid, empire, s, independence, from, caliphal, authority, despite, mahmud, s, ostentatious, displays, of, sunni, orthodoxy, and, ritual, submission, to, the, caliph, in, the, 11th, century, the, loss, of, respect, for, the, caliphs, continued, as, some, islamic, rulers, no, longer, mentioned, the, caliph, s, name, in, the, friday, khutba, or, struck, it, off, their, coinage, the, isma, ili, fatimid, dynasty, of, cairo, contested, the, abbasids, for, the, titular, authority, of, the, islamic, ummah, they, commanded, some, support, in, the, shia, sections, of, baghdad, such, as, karkh, although, baghdad, was, the, city, most, closely, connected, to, the, caliphate, even, in, the, buyid, and, seljuq, eras, the, challenge, of, the, fatimids, only, ended, with, their, downfall, in, the, 12th, century, despite, the, power, of, the, buyid, amirs, the, abbasids, retained, a, highly, ritualized, court, in, baghdad, as, described, by, the, buyid, bureaucrat, hilal, al, sabi, and, they, retained, a, certain, influence, over, baghdad, as, well, as, religious, life, as, buyid, power, waned, with, the, rule, of, baha, al, daula, the, caliphate, was, able, to, regain, some, measure, of, strength, the, caliph, al, qadir, for, example, led, the, ideological, struggle, against, the, shia, with, writings, such, as, the, baghdad, manifesto, the, caliphs, kept, order, in, baghdad, itself, attempting, to, prevent, the, outbreak, of, fitnas, in, the, capital, often, contending, with, the, ayyarun, with, the, buyid, dynasty, on, the, wane, a, vacuum, was, created, that, was, eventually, filled, by, the, dynasty, of, oghuz, turks, known, as, the, seljuqs, by, 1055, the, seljuqs, had, wrested, control, from, the, buyids, and, abbasids, and, took, temporal, power, when, the, amir, and, former, slave, basasiri, took, up, the, shia, fatimid, banner, in, baghdad, in, 1056, 57, the, caliph, al, qa, im, was, unable, to, defeat, him, without, outside, help, toghril, beg, the, seljuq, sultan, restored, baghdad, to, sunni, rule, and, took, iraq, for, his, dynasty, once, again, the, abbasids, were, forced, to, deal, with, a, military, power, that, they, could, not, match, though, the, abbasid, caliph, remained, the, titular, head, of, the, islamic, community, the, succeeding, sultans, alp, arslan, and, malikshah, as, well, as, their, vizier, nizam, al, mulk, took, up, residence, in, persia, but, held, power, over, the, abbasids, in, baghdad, when, the, dynasty, began, to, weaken, in, the, 12th, century, the, abbasids, gained, greater, independence, once, again, while, the, caliph, al, mustarshid, was, the, first, caliph, to, build, an, army, capable, of, meeting, a, seljuk, army, in, battle, he, was, nonetheless, defeated, and, assassinated, in, 1135, the, caliph, al, muqtafi, was, the, first, abbasid, caliph, to, regain, the, full, military, independence, of, the, caliphate,

hadith, such, as, the, ink, of, a, scholar, is, more, holy, than, the, blood, of, a, martyr, stressing, the, value, of, knowledge, during, this, period, the, muslim, world, became, an, intellectual, center, for, science, philosophy, medicine, and, education, as, the, abbasids, championed, the, cause, of, knowledge, and, established, the, house, of, wisdom, in, baghdad, where, both, muslim, and, non, muslim, scholars, sought, to, translate, and, gather, all, the, world, s, knowledge, into, arabic, many, classic, works, of, antiquity, that, would, otherwise, have, been, lost, were, translated, into, arabic, and, persian, and, later, in, turn, translated, into, turkish, hebrew, and, latin, during, this, period, the, muslim, world, was, a, cauldron, of, cultures, which, collected, synthesized, and, significantly, advanced, the, knowledge, gained, from, the, roman, chinese, indian, persian, egyptian, north, african, ancient, greek, and, medieval, greek, civilizations, according, to, huff, n, virtually, every, field, of, endeavor, in, astronomy, alchemy, mathematics, medicine, optics, and, so, forth, the, caliphate, s, scientists, were, in, the, forefront, of, scientific,

the, abbasid, era, the, collection, is, recorded, as, having, originated, from, an, arabic, translation, of, a, sassanian, era, persian, prototype, with, likely, origins, in, indian, literary, traditions, stories, from, arabic, persian, mesopotamian, and, egyptian, folklore, and, literature, were, later, incorporated, the, epic, is, believed, to, have, taken, shape, in, the, 10th, century, and, reached, its, final, form, by, the, 14th, century, the, number, and, type, of, tales, have, varied, from, one, manuscript, to, another, all, arabian, fantasy, tales, were, often, called, arabian, nights, when, translated, into, english, regardless, of, whether, they, appeared, in, the, book, of, one, thousand, and, one, nights, this, epic, has, been, influential, in, the, west, since, it, was, translated, in, the, 18th, century, first, by, antoine, galland, many, imitations, were, written, especially, in, france, various, characters, from, this, epic, have, themselves, become, cultural, icons, in, western, culture, such, as, aladdin, sinbad, and, ali, baba, a, famous, example, of, islamic, poetry, on, romance, was, layla, and, majnun, an, originally, arabic, story, which, was, further, developed, by, iranian, azerbaijani, and, other, poets, in, the, persian, azerbaijani, and, turkish, languages, it, is, a, tragic, story, of, undying, love, much, like, the, later, romeo, and, juliet, arabic, poetry, reached, its, greatest, height, in, the, abbasid, era, especially, before, the, loss, of, central, authority, and, the, rise, of, the, persianate, dynasties, writers, like, abu, tammam, and, abu, nuwas, were, closely, connected, to, the, caliphal, court, in, baghdad, during, the, early, 9th, century, while, others, such, as, al, mutanabbi, received, their, patronage, from, regional, courts, under, harun, al, rashid, baghdad, was, renowned, for, its, bookstores, which, proliferated, after, the, making, of, paper, was, introduced, chinese, papermakers, had, been, among, those, taken, prisoner, by, the, arabs, at, the, battle, of, talas, in, 751, as, prisoners, of, war, they, were, dispatched, to, samarkand, where, they, helped, set, up, the, first, arab, paper, mill, in, time, paper, replaced, parchment, as, the, medium, for, writing, and, the, production, of, books, greatly, increased, these, events, had, an, academic, and, societal, impact, that, could, be, broadly, compared, to, the, introduction, of, the, printing, press, in, the, west, paper, aided, in, communication, and, record, keeping, it, also, brought, a, new, sophistication, and, complexity, to, businesses, banking, and, the, civil, service, in, 794, jafa, al, barmak, built, the, first, paper, mill, in, baghdad, and, from, there, the, technology, circulated, harun, required, that, paper, be, employed, in, government, dealings, since, something, recorded, on, paper, could, not, easily, be, changed, or, removed, and, eventually, an, entire, street, in, baghdad, s, business, district, was, dedicated, to, selling, paper, and, books, one, of, the, common, definitions, for, islamic, philosophy, is, the, style, of, philosophy, produced, within, the, framework, of, islamic, culture, islamic, philosophy, in, this, definition, is, neither, necessarily, concerned, with, religious, issues, nor, is, exclusively, produced, by, muslims, their, works, on, aristotle, were, a, key, step, in, the, transmission, of, learning, from, ancient, greeks, to, the, islamic, world, and, the, west, they, often, corrected, the, philosopher, encouraging, a, lively, debate, in, the, spirit, of, ijtihad, they, also, wrote, influential, original, philosophical, works, and, their, thinking, was, incorporated, into, christian, philosophy, during, the, middle, ages, notably, by, thomas, aquinas, three, speculative, thinkers, al, kindi, al, farabi, and, avicenna, combined, aristotelianism, and, neoplatonism, with, other, ideas, introduced, through, islam, and, avicennism, was, later, established, as, a, result, other, influential, abbasid, philosophers, include, al, jahiz, and, ibn, al, haytham, alhacen, as, power, shifted, from, the, umayyads, to, the, abbasids, the, architectural, styles, changed, also, from, greco, roman, tradition, which, features, elements, of, hellenistic, and, roman, representative, style, to, eastern, tradition, which, retained, their, independent, architectural, traditions, from, mesopotamia, and, persia, the, abbasid, architecture, was, particularly, influenced, by, sasanian, architecture, which, in, turn, featured, elements, present, since, ancient, mesopotamia, the, christian, styles, evolved, into, a, style, based, more, on, the, sasanian, empire, utilizing, mud, bricks, and, baked, bricks, with, carved, stucco, other, architectural, innovations, and, styles, were, few, such, as, the, four, centered, arch, and, a, dome, erected, on, squinches, unfortunately, much, was, lost, due, to, the, ephemeral, nature, of, the, stucco, and, luster, tiles, another, major, development, was, the, creation, or, vast, enlargement, of, cities, as, they, were, turned, into, the, capital, of, the, empire, beginning, with, the, creation, of, baghdad, in, 762, which, was, planned, as, a, walled, city, with, four, gates, and, a, mosque, and, palace, in, the, center, al, mansur, who, was, responsible, for, the, creation, of, baghdad, also, planned, the, city, of, raqqa, along, the, euphrates, finally, in, 836, al, mu, tasim, moved, the, capital, to, a, new, site, that, he, created, along, the, tigris, called, samarra, this, city, saw, 60, years, of, work, with, race, courses, and, game, preserves, to, add, to, the, atmosphere, due, to, the, dry, remote, nature, of, the, environment, some, of, the, palaces, built, in, this, era, were, isolated, havens, al, ukhaidir, fortress, is, a, fine, example, of, this, type, of, building, which, has, stables, living, quarters, and, a, mosque, all, surrounding, inner, courtyards, mesopotamia, only, has, one, surviving, mausoleum, from, this, era, in, samarra, an, octagonal, domed, structured, known, as, the, qubbat, al, sulaibiyya, which, is, the, first, known, monumental, tomb, in, islamic, architecture, and, may, be, the, final, resting, place, of, al, muntasir, baghdad, the, epicenter, of, the, empire, was, originally, organized, in, a, circular, fashion, next, to, the, tigris, river, with, massive, brick, walls, being, constructed, in, successive, rings, around, the, core, by, a, workforce, of, 100, 000, with, four, huge, gates, named, kufa, basrah,

canals, servicing, the, population, outside, the, abbasid, heartlands, architecture, was, still, influenced, by, the, capital, in, present, day, tunisia, the, great, mosque, of, kairouan, was, founded, under, the, umayyad, dynasty, but, completely, rebuilt, in, the, 9th, century, under, the, patronage, of, the, aghlabids, vassals, of, the, abbasids, the, styles, utilized, were, mainly, abbasid, in, egypt, ahmad, ibn, tulun, commissioned, the, ibn, tulun, mosque, completed, in, 879, that, is, based, on, the, style, of, samarra, and, is, now, one, of, the, best, preserved, abbasid, style, mosques, from, this, period, the, near, east, has, since, roman, times, been, recognized, as, a, center, of, quality, glassware, and, crystal, 9th, century, finds, from, samarra, show, styles, similar, to, sassanian, forms, the, types, of, objects, made, were, bottles, flasks, vases, and, cups, intended, for, domestic, use, with, decorations, including, molded, flutes, honeycomb, patterns, and, inscriptions, other, styles, seen, that, may, not, have, come, from, the, sassanians, were, stamped, items, these, were, typically, round, stamps, such, as, medallions, or, disks, with, animals, birds, or, kufic, inscriptions, colored, lead, glass, typically, blue, or, green, has, been, found, in, nishapur, along, with, prismatic, perfume, bottles, finally, cut, glass, may, have, been, the, high, point, of, abbasid, glass, working, decorated, with, floral, and, animal, designs, early, abbasid, painting, has, not, survived, in, great, quantities, and, is, sometimes, harder, to, differentiate, however, samarra, provides, good, examples, as, it, was, built, by, the, abbasids, and, abandoned, 56, years, later, the, walls, of, the, principal, rooms, of, the, palace, that, have, been, excavated, show, wall, paintings, and, lively, carved, stucco, dadoes, the, earlier, style, is, obviously, adopted, with, little, variation, from, sassanian, art, with, similar, styles, with, harems, animals, dancing, people, and, garments, all, enclosed, in, scrollwork, nishapur, had, its, own, school, of, painting, excavations, at, nishapur, show, both, monochromatic, and, polychromatic, artwork, from, the, 8th, and, 9th, centuries, one, famous, piece, of, art, consists, of, hunting, nobles, with, falcons, and, on, horseback, in, full, regalia, the, clothing, identifies, them, as, tahirid, which, was, again, a, sub, dynasty, of, the, abbasids, other, styles, are, of, vegetation, and, fruit, in, nice, colors, on, a, four, foot, high, dedo, whereas, painting, and, architecture, were, not, areas, of, strength, for, the, abbasid, dynasty, pottery, was, a, different, story, islamic, culture, as, a, whole, and, the, abbasids, in, particular, were, at, the, forefront, of, new, ideas, and, techniques, some, examples, of, their, work, were, pieces, engraved, with, decorations, and, then, colored, with, yellow, brown, green, and, purple, glazes, designs, were, diverse, with, geometric, patterns, kufic, lettering, and, arabesque, scrollwork, along, with, rosettes, animals, birds, and, humans, abbasid, pottery, from, the, 8th, and, 9th, centuries, has, been, found, throughout, the, region, as, far, as, cairo, these, were, generally, made, with, a, yellow, clay, and, fired, multiple, times, with, separate, glazes, to, produce, metallic, luster, in, shades, of, gold, brown, or, red, by, the, 9th, century, the, potters, had, mastered, their, techniques, and, their, decorative, designs, could, be, divided, into, two, styles, the, persian, style, would, show, animals, birds, and, humans, along, with, kufic, lettering, in, gold, pieces, excavated, from, samarra, exceed, in, vibrancy, and, beauty, any, from, later, periods, these, were, predominantly, being, made, for, the, caliph, s, use, tiles, were, also, made, using, this, same, technique, to, create, both, monochromatic, and, polychromatic, lusterware, tiles, egypt, being, a, center, of, the, textile, industry, was, part, of, abbasid, cultural, advancement, copts, were, employed, in, the, textile, industry, and, produced, linens, and, silks, tinnis, was, famous, for, its, factories, and, had, over, 5, 000, looms, examples, of, textiles, were, kasab, a, fine, linen, for, turbans, and, badana, for, upper, class, garments, the, kiswah, for, the, kaaba, in, mecca, was, made, in, a, town, named, tuna, near, tinnis, fine, silk, was, also, made, in, dabik, and, damietta, of, particular, interest, are, stamped, and, inscribed, fabrics, which, used, not, only, inks, but, also, liquid, gold, some, of, the, finer, pieces, were, colored, in, such, a, manner, as, to, require, six, separate, stamps, to, achieve, the, proper, design, and, color, this, technology, spread, to, europe, eventually, the, abbasid, period, saw, a, large, fashion, development, throughout, its, existence, while, the, development, of, fashion, began, during, the, umayyad, period, its, genuine, cosmopolitan, styles, and, influence, were, realized, at, their, finest, during, abbasid, rule, fashion, was, a, thriving, industry, during, the, abbasid, period, that, was, also, strictly, regulated, either, by, law, or, through, the, accepted, elements, of, style, among, the, higher, classes, appearance, became, a, concern, and, they, started, to, care, about, appearance, and, fashion, several, new, garments, and, fabrics, were, introduced, into, common, use, and, no, longer, observed, pious, distaste, for, materials, such, as, silk, and, satins, the, rise, of, the, persian, secretarial, class, had, a, large, influence, over, the, development, of, fashion, and, the, abbasids, were, highly, influenced, by, the, older, persian, court, dress, elements, for, example, the, caliph, al, mu, tasim, was, reportedly, notable, for, his, desire, to, imitate, persian, kings, by, wearing, a, turban, over, a, soft, cap, which, was, later, adopted, by, other, abbasid, rulers, and, called, it, the, mu, tasimi, in, his, honor, the, abbasids, wore, many, layers, of, garments, fabrics, used, for, the, clothing, seemed, to, have, included, wool, linen, brocades, or, silk, the, clothing, of, the, poorer, classes, was, made, out, of, cheaper, materials, such, as, wool, and, had, less, fabric, this, also, meant, they, wouldn, t, be, able, to, afford, the, variety, of, garments, that, the, elite, classes, wore, elegant, women, would, not, wear, black, green, red, or, pink, except, for, fabrics, that, naturally, had, those, colors, such, as, red, silk, women, s, clothing, would, be, perfumed, with, musk, sandalwood, hyacinth, or, ambergris, but, no, other, scents, footwear, included, furry, cambay, shoes, boots, of, the, style, of, persian, ladies, and, curved, shoes, caliph, al, mansur, was, credited, with, making, his, court, and, the, abbasid, high, ranking, officials, wear, honorific, robes, of, the, color, black, for, various, ceremonial, affairs, and, events, which, became, the, official, color, of, the, caliphate, this, was, acknowledged, in, china, and, byzantium, who, called, the, abbasids, the, black, robed, ones, but, despite, the, color, black, being, common, during, the, caliphate, many, color, dyes, existed, and, it, was, made, sure, that, colors, would, not, clash, notably, the, color, yellow, needed, to, be, avoided, when, wearing, colored, clothing, abbasid, caliphs, wore, elegant, kaftans, a, robe, made, from, silver, or, gold, brocade, and, buttons, in, the, front, of, the, sleeves, caliph, al, muqtaddir, wore, a, kaftan, from, silver, brocade, tustari, silk, and, his, son, one, made, from, byzantine, silk, richly, decorated, or, ornamented, with, figures, the, kaftan, was, spread, far, and, wide, by, the, abbasids, and, made, known, throughout, the, arab, world, in, the, 830s, emperor, theophilus, went, about, l, arabe, in, kaftans, and, turbans, even, as, far, as, the, streets, of, ghuangzhou, during, the, era, of, tang, dynasty, the, persian, kaftan, was, in, fashion, the, production, of, qur, anic, manuscripts, flourished, under, the, abbasid, caliphate, primarily, between, the, late, 8th, and, early, 10th, century, during, this, period, copies, of, the, qur, an, were, frequently, commissioned, for, members, of, the, abbasid, court, and, the, wealthy, elite, in, muslim, society, with, the, increased, dissemination, of, the, qur, an, also, came, the, growth, of, arabic, calligraphy, bookbinding, techniques, and, illumination, styles, this, expansion, and, establishment, of, the, book, arts, culminated, in, a, formative, period, of, the, islamic, manuscript, tradition, the, earliest, style, of, calligraphy, used, for, abbasid, qur, ans, was, known, as, the, kufic, script, a, script, distinguished, by, precise, angular, letters, generous, spacing, horizontal, extension, of, letters, at, the, baseline, and, an, emphasis, on, geometric, proportion, qur, ans, copied, in, this, script, were, typically, formatted, in, a, horizontal, manner, and, were, written, on, parchment, qur, ans, of, this, variety, were, most, popular, in, the, second, half, of, the, 8th, century, during, the, late, 9th, century, and, early, 10th, century, a, new, system, of, calligraphy, was, introduced, by, abbasid, vizier, and, calligrapher, abu, ali, muhammad, ibn, muqla, 866, 940, he, developed, this, proportional, writing, system, around, two, shapes, a, circle, the, size, of, an, alif, and, rhomboid, dots, that, could, be, created, with, the, nib, of, a, reed, pen, this, script, later, known, as, the, new, abbasid, style, was, characterized, by, its, vertical, letters, extreme, angularity, and, a, distinct, contrast, between, the, width, of, strokes, the, development, of, this, proportional, script, also, coincided, with, a, shift, back, into, a, vertical, page, orientation, the, new, style, script, was, further, developed, for, secular, purposes, because, of, its, legibility, and, efficient, nature, illumination, techniques, and, trends, under, the, abbasid, caliphate, were, often, dependent, upon, script, style, as, qur, ans, shifted, from, kufic, to, new, style, script, illumination, methods, also, changed, the, illumination, of, early, abbasid, qur, ans, late, 8th, century, was, largely, dominated, by, geometric, and, vegetal, shapes, these, ornamental, elements, were, often, concentrated, at, the, beginning, and, end, of, volumes, as, well, as, in, between, suras, another, defining, element, of, the, early, abbasid, technique, was, the, absence, of, text, on, the, frontispiece, of, the, qur, an, the, introduction, of, the, new, abbasid, style, in, the, 10th, century, however, led, to, a, shift, in, illumination, techniques, illuminators, found, ways, to, accommodate, the, dense, script, and, vertical, orientation, of, text, as, such, illuminated, qur, ans, began, to, display, additional, decorative, elements, beyond, geometric, and, vegetal, shapes, to, denote, divisions, within, the, text, furthermore, qur, ans, with, the, new, style, of, script, were, copied, with, the, first, sura, on, the, frontispiece, of, the, manuscript, these, stylistic, shifts, are, representative, of, developing, illumination, arts, under, abbasid, rule, the, main, form, of, bookbinding, used, under, the, abbasid, caliphate, was, the, binding, cum, case, or, box, manuscript, this, technique, covered, the, qur, an, in, a, casket, like, box, in, order, to, protect, the, contents, these, boxes, were, typically, made, out, of, wooden, boards, and, had, a, protective, lining, on, the, manuscript, facing, side, the, leather, bound, qur, an, would, have, been, placed, in, the, box, which, then, would, have, been, fitted, with, a, locking, mechanism, one, of, the, most, notable, parchment, manuscripts, created, during, the, early, abbasid, caliphate, was, the, amajur, qur, an, this, qur, an, was, endowed, by, amajur, al, turki, the, abbasid, governor, of, damascus, from, 870, to, 878, and, was, created, during, the, 9th, century, despite, being, a, luxury, example, this, qur, an, is, indicative, of, the, form, and, script, practices, that, were, being, standardized, in, the, heart, of, the, early, abbasid, caliphate, the, text, was, copied, in, the, kufic, style, and, in, a, horizontal, orientation, the, style, of, script, size, and, oblong, shape, of, the, amajur, qur, an, aligned, with, other, examples, from, the, 9th, century, furthermore, the, qur, an, was, copied, onto, parchment, a, material, that, was, commonly, used, for, manuscripts, under, early, abbasid, rule, lastly, the, amajur, qur, an, was, bound, in, leather, and, stored, in, a, protective, chest, this, bookbinding, style, was, a, standard, technique, during, the, 9th, century, a, number, of, medieval, thinkers, and, scientists, living, under, islamic, rule, played, a, role, in, transmitting, islamic, science, to, the, christian, west, in, addition, the, period, saw, the, recovery, of, much, of, the, alexandrian, mathematical, geometric, and, astronomical, knowledge, such, as, that, of, euclid, and, claudius, ptolemy, these, recovered, mathematical, methods, were, later, enhanced, and, developed, by, other, islamic, scholars, notably, by, persian, scientists, al, biruni, and, abu, nasr, mansur, christians, particularly, nestorian, christians, contributed, to, the, arab, islamic, civilization, during, the, umayyads, and, the, abbasids, by, translating, works, of, greek, philosophers, to, syriac, and, afterwards, to, arabic, nestorians, played, a, prominent, role, in, the, formation, of, arab, culture, with, the, academy, of, gondishapur, being, prominent, in, the, late, sassanid, umayyad, and, early, abbasid, periods, notably, eight, generations, of, the, nestorian, bukhtishu, family, served, as, private, doctors, to, caliphs, and, sultans, between, the, eighth, and, eleventh, centuries, algebra, was, significantly, developed, by, persian, scientist, muhammad, ibn, m, s, al, khw, rizm, during, this, time, in, his, landmark, text, kitab, al, jabr, wa, l, muqabala, from, which, the, term, algebra, is, derived, he, is, thus, considered, to, be, the, father, of, algebra, by, some, although, the, greek, mathematician, diophantus, has, also, been, given, this, title, the, terms, algorism, and, algorithm, are, derived, from, the, name, of, al, khwarizmi, who, was, also, responsible, for, introducing, the, arabic, numerals, and, hindu, arabic, numeral, system, beyond, the, indian, subcontinent, arab, scientist, ibn, al, haytham, alhazen, developed, an, early, scientific, method, in, his, book, of, optics, 1021, the, most, important, development, of, the, scientific, method, was, the, use, of, experiments, to, distinguish, between, competing, scientific, theories, set, within, a, generally, empirical, orientation, which, began, among, muslim, scientists, ibn, al, haytham, s, empirical, proof, of, the, intromission, theory, of, light, that, is, that, light, rays, entered, the, eyes, rather, than, being, emitted, by, them, was, particularly, important, ibn, al, haytham, was, significant, in, the, history, of, scientific, method, particularly, in, his, approach, to, experimentation, and, has, been, referred, to, as, the, world, s, first, true, scientist, medicine, in, medieval, islam, was, an, area, of, science, that, advanced, particularly, during, the, abbasids, reign, during, the, 9th, century, baghdad, contained, over, 800, doctors, and, great, discoveries, in, the, understanding, of, anatomy, and, diseases, were, made, the, clinical, distinction, between, measles, and, smallpox, was, described, during, this, time, famous, persian, scientist, ibn, sina, known, to, the, west, as, avicenna, produced, treatises, and, works, that, summarized, the, vast, amount, of, knowledge, that, scientists, had, accumulated, and, was, very, influential, through, his, encyclopedias, the, canon, of, medicine, and, the, book, of, healing, the, work, of, him, and, many, others, directly, influenced, the, research, of, european, scientists, during, the, renaissance, astronomy, in, medieval, islam, was, advanced, by, al, battani, who, improved, the, precision, of, the, measurement, of, the, precession, of, the, earth, s, axis, the, corrections, made, to, the, geocentric, model, by, al, battani, averroes, nasir, al, din, al, tusi, mo, ayyeduddin, urdi, and, ibn, al, shatir, were, later, incorporated, into, the, copernican, heliocentric, model, the, astrolabe, though, originally, developed, by, the, greeks, was, developed, further, by, islamic, astronomers, and, engineers, and, subsequently, brought, to, medieval, europe, muslim, alchemists, influenced, medieval, european, alchemists, particularly, the, writings, attributed, to, j, bir, ibn, hayy, n, geber, in, technology, the, abbasids, adopted, papermaking, from, china, the, use, of, paper, spread, from, china, into, the, caliphate, in, the, 8th, century, ce, arriving, in, al, andalus, islamic, spain, and, then, the, rest, of, europe, in, the, 10th, century, it, was, easier, to, manufacture, than, parchment, less, likely, to, crack, than, papyrus, and, could, absorb, ink, making, it, ideal, for, making, records, and, copies, of, the, qur, an, islamic, paper, makers, devised, assembly, line, methods, of, hand, copying, manuscripts, to, turn, out, editions, far, larger, than, any, available, in, europe, for, centuries, it, was, from, the, abbasids, that, the, rest, of, the, world, learned, to, make, paper, from, linen, the, knowledge, of, gunpowder, was, also, transmitted, from, china, via, the, caliphate, where, the, formulas, for, pure, potassium, nitrate, and, an, explosive, gunpowder, effect, were, first, developed, advances, were, made, in, irrigation, and, farming, using, new, technology, such, as, the, windmill, crops, such, as, almonds, and, citrus, fruit, were, brought, to, europe, through, al, andalus, and, sugar, cultivation, was, gradually, adopted, by, the, europeans, apart, from, the, nile, tigris, and, euphrates, navigable, rivers, were, uncommon, so, transport, by, sea, was, very, important, navigational, sciences, were, highly, developed, making, use, of, a, rudimentary, sextant, known, as, a, kamal, when, combined, with, detailed, maps, of, the, period, sailors, were, able, to, sail, across, oceans, rather, than, skirt, along, the, coast, abbasid, sailors, were, also, responsible, for, reintroducing, large, three, masted, merchant, vessels, to, the, mediterranean, the, name, caravel, may, derive, from, an, earlier, arab, ship, known, as, the, q, rib, arab, merchants, dominated, trade, in, the, indian, ocean, until, the, arrival, of, the, portuguese, in, the, 16th, century, hormuz, was, an, important, center, for, this, trade, there, was, also, a, dense, network, of, trade, routes, in, the, mediterranean, along, which, muslim, countries, traded, with, each, other, and, with, european, powers, such, as, venice, or, genoa, the, silk, road, crossing, central, asia, passed, through, the, abbasid, caliphate, between, china, and, europe, engineers, in, the, abbasid, caliphate, made, a, number, of, innovative, industrial, uses, of, hydropower, and, early, industrial, uses, of, tidal, power, wind, power, and, petroleum, notably, by, distillation, into, kerosene, the, industrial, uses, of, watermills, in, the, islamic, world, date, back, to, the, 7th, century, while, horizontal, wheeled, and, vertical, wheeled, water, mills, were, both, in, widespread, use, since, at, least, the, 9th, century, by, the, time, of, the, crusades, every, province, throughout, the, islamic, world, had, mills, in, operation, from, al, andalus, and, north, africa, to, the, middle, east, and, central, asia, these, mills, performed, a, variety, of, agricultural, and, industrial, tasks, abbasid, engineers, also, developed, machines, such, as, pumps, incorporating, crankshafts, employed, gears, in, mills, and, water, raising, machines, and, used, dams, to, provide, additional, power, to, watermills, and, water, raising, machines, such, advances, made, it, possible, for, many, industrial, tasks, that, were, previously, driven, by, manual, labour, in, ancient, times, to, be, mechanized, and, driven, by, machinery, instead, in, the, medieval, islamic, world, it, has, been, argued, that, the, industrial, use, of, waterpower, had, spread, from, islamic, to, christian, spain, where, fulling, mills, paper, mills, and, forge, mills, were, recorded, for, the, first, time, in, catalonia, a, number, of, industries, were, generated, during, the, arab, agricultural, revolution, including, early, industries, for, textiles, sugar, rope, making, matting, silk, and, paper, latin, translations, of, the, 12th, century, passed, on, knowledge, of, chemistry, and, instrument, making, in, particular, the, agricultural, and, handicraft, industries, also, experienced, high, levels, of, growth, during, this, period, while, the, abbasids, originally, gained, power, by, exploiting, the, social, inequalities, against, non, arabs, in, the, umayyad, empire, during, abbasid, rule, the, empire, rapidly, arabized, particularly, in, the, fertile, crescent, region, namely, mesopotamia, and, the, levant, as, had, begun, under, umayyad, rule, as, knowledge, was, shared, in, the, arabic, language, throughout, the, empire, many, people, from, different, nationalities, and, religions, began, to, speak, arabic, in, their, everyday, lives, resources, from, other, languages, began, to, be, translated, into, arabic, and, a, unique, islamic, identity, began, to, form, that, fused, previous, cultures, with, arab, culture, creating, a, level, of, civilization, and, knowledge, that, was, considered, a, marvel, in, europe, at, the, time, in, contrast, to, the, earlier, era, women, in, abbasid, society, were, absent, from, all, arenas, of, the, community, s, central, affairs, while, their, muslim, forebears, led, men, into, battle, started, rebellions, and, played, an, active, role, in, community, life, as, demonstrated, in, the, hadith, literature, abbasid, women, were, ideally, kept, in, seclusion, conquests, had, brought, enormous, wealth, and, large, numbers, of, slaves, to, the, muslim, elite, the, majority, of, the, slaves, were, women, and, children, many, of, whom, had, been, dependents, or, harem, members, of, the, defeated, sassanian, upper, classes, in, the, wake, of, the, conquests, an, elite, man, could, potentially, own, a, thousand, slaves, and, ordinary, soldiers, could, have, ten, people, serving, them, it, was, narrated, from, ibn, abbas, that, muhammad, said, there, is, no, man, whose, two, daughters, reach, the, age, of, puberty, and, he, treats, them, kindly, for, the, time, they, are, together, but, they, will, gain, him, admittance, to, paradise, whoever, has, three, daughters, and, is, patient, towards, them, and, feeds, them, gives, them, to, drink, and, clothes, them, from, his, wealth, they, will, be, a, shield, for, him, from, the, fire, on, the, day, of, resurrection, even, so, slave, courtesans, qiyans, and, jawaris, and, princesses, produced, prestigious, and, important, poetry, enough, survives, to, give, us, access, to, women, s, historical, experiences, and, reveals, some, vivacious, and, powerful, figures, such, as, the, sufi, mystic, raabi, a, al, adwiyya, 714, 801, ce, the, princess, and, poet, ulayya, bint, al, mahdi, 777, 825, ce, and, the, singing, girls, sh, riyah, c, 815, 870, ce, fadl, ashsha, ira, d, 871, ce, and, arib, al, ma, muniyya, 797, 890, ce, each, wife, in, the, abbasid, harem, had, an, additional, home, or, flat, with, her, own, enslaved, staff, of, eunuchs, and, maidservants, when, a, concubine, gave, birth, to, a, son, she, was, elevated, in, rank, to, umm, walad, and, also, received, apartments, and, slave, servants, as, a, gift, the, status, and, treatment, of, jews, christians, and, non, muslims, in, the, abbasid, caliphate, was, a, complex, and, continually, changing, issue, non, muslims, were, called, dhimmis, dhimmis, faced, some, level, of, discrimination, in, abbasid, society, they, did, not, have, all, the, privileges, of, muslims, and, had, to, pay, jizya, a, tax, on, non, muslims, however, as, people, of, the, book, non, muslim, monotheists, jews, and, christians, were, allowed, to, practice, their, religion, and, were, not, required, to, convert, one, of, the, common, aspects, of, the, treatment, of, the, dhimmis, is, that, their, treatment, depended, on, who, the, caliph, was, at, the, time, some, abbasid, rulers, like, al, mutawakkil, 822, 861, ce, imposed, strict, restrictions, on, what, dhimmis, could, wear, in, public, often, yellow, garments, that, distinguished, them, from, muslims, other, restrictions, al, mutawakkil, imposed, included, limiting, the, role, of, the, dhimmis, in, government, seizing, dhimmi, housing, and, making, it, harder, for, dhimmis, to, become, educated, most, other, abbasid, caliphs, were, not, as, strict, as, al, mutawakkil, though, during, the, reign, of, al, mansur, 714, 775, ce, it, was, common, for, jews, and, christians, to, influence, the, overall, culture, in, the, caliphate, specifically, in, baghdad, jews, and, christians, did, this, by, participating, in, scholarly, work, it, was, common, that, laws, that, were, imposed, against, dhimmis, during, one, caliph, s, rule, were, either, discarded, or, not, practiced, during, future, caliphs, reigns, al, mansur, and, al, mutawakkil, both, instituted, laws, that, forbade, non, muslims, from, participating, in, public, office, al, mansur, did, not, follow, his, own, law, very, closely, bringing, dhimmis, back, to, the, caliphate, s, treasury, due, to, the, needed, expertise, of, dhimmis, in, the, area, of, finance, al, mutawakkil, followed, the, law, banning, dhimmis, from, public, office, more, seriously, although, soon, after, his, reign, many, of, the, laws, concerning, dhimmis, participating, in, government, were, completely, unobserved, or, at, least, less, strictly, observed, even, al, muqtadir, r, 908, 932, ce, who, held, a, similar, stance, as, al, mutawakkil, on, barring, non, muslims, from, public, office, himself, had, multiple, christian, secretaries, indicating, that, non, muslims, still, had, access, to, many, of, the, most, important, figures, within, the, caliphate, past, having, a, casual, association, or, just, being, a, secretary, to, high, ranking, islamic, officials, some, of, them, achieved, the, second, highest, office, after, the, caliph, the, vizier, jews, and, christians, may, have, had, a, lower, overall, status, compared, to, muslims, in, the, abbasid, caliphate, but, dhimmis, were, often, allowed, to, hold, respectable, and, even, prestigious, occupations, in, some, cases, such, as, doctors, and, public, officeholders, jews, and, christians, were, also, allowed, to, be, rich, even, if, they, were, taxed, for, being, a, dhimmi, dhimmis, were, capable, of, moving, up, and, down, the, social, ladder, though, this, largely, depended, on, the, particular, caliph, an, indication, as, to, the, social, standing, of, jews, and, christians, at, the, time, was, their, ability, to, live, next, to, muslim, people, while, al, mansur, was, ruling, the, caliphate, for, instance, it, was, not, uncommon, for, dhimmis, to, live, in, the, same, neighborhoods, as, muslims, one, of, the, biggest, reasons, why, dhimmis, were, allowed, to, hold, prestigious, jobs, and, positions, in, government, is, that, they, were, generally, important, to, the, well, being, of, the, state, and, were, proficient, to, excellent, with, the, work, at, hand, some, muslims, in, the, caliphate, took, offense, to, the, idea, that, there, were, dhimmis, in, public, offices, who, were, in, a, way, ruling, over, them, although, it, was, an, islamic, state, while, other, muslims, were, at, time, jealous, of, some, dhimmis, for, having, a, level, of, wealth, or, prestige, greater, than, other, muslims, even, if, muslims, were, still, the, majority, of, the, ruling, class, in, general, muslims, jews, and, christians, had, close, relations, that, could, be, considered, positive, at, times, especially, for, jews, in, contrast, to, how, jews, were, being, treated, in, europe, many, of, the, laws, and, restrictions, that, were, imposed, on, dhimmis, often, resembled, other, laws, that, previous, states, had, used, to, discriminate, against, a, minority, religion, specifically, jewish, people, romans, in, the, fourth, century, banned, jewish, people, from, holding, public, offices, banned, roman, citizens, from, converting, to, judaism, and, often, demoted, jews, who, were, serving, in, the, roman, military, in, direct, contrast, there, was, an, event, in, which, two, viziers, ibn, al, furat, and, ali, ibn, isa, ibn, al, jarrah, argued, about, ibn, al, furat, s, decision, to, make, a, christian, the, head, of, the, military, a, previous, vizier, abu, muhammad, al, hasan, al, bazuri, had, done, so, these, laws, predated, al, mansur, s, laws, against, dhimmis, and, often, had, similar, restrictions, although, roman, emperors, were, often, much, more, strict, on, enforcing, these, laws, than, many, abbasid, caliphs, most, of, baghdad, s, jews, were, incorporated, into, the, arab, community, and, considered, arabic, their, native, language, some, jews, studied, hebrew, in, their, schools, and, jewish, religious, education, flourished, the, united, muslim, empire, allowed, jews, to, reconstruct, links, between, their, dispersed, communities, throughout, the, middle, east, the, city, s, talmudic, institute, helped, spread, the, rabbinical, tradition, to, europe, and, the, jewish, community, in, baghdad, went, on, to, establish, ten, rabbinical, schools, and, twenty, three, synagogues, baghdad, not, only, contained, the, tombs, of, muslim, saints, and, martyrs, but, also, the, tomb, of, yusha, whose, corpse, had, been, brought, to, iraq, during, the, first, migration, of, the, jews, out, of, the, levant, there, were, large, feasts, on, certain, days, as, the, muslims, of, the, empire, celebrated, christian, holidays, as, well, as, their, own, there, were, two, main, islamic, feasts, one, marked, by, the, end, of, ramadan, the, other, the, feast, of, sacrifice, the, former, was, especially, joyful, because, children, would, purchase, decorations, and, sweetmeats, people, prepared, the, best, food, and, bought, new, clothes, at, midmorning, the, caliph, wearing, muhammad, s, thobe, would, guide, officials, accompanied, by, armed, soldiers, to, the, great, mosque, where, he, led, prayers, after, the, prayer, all, those, in, attendance, would, exchange, the, best, wishes, and, hug, their, kin, and, companions, the, festivities, lasted, for, three, days, during, those, limited, number, of, nights, the, palaces, were, lit, up, and, boats, on, the, tigris, hung, lights, it, was, said, that, baghdad, glittered, like, a, bride, during, the, feast, of, sacrifice, sheep, were, butchered, in, public, arenas, and, the, caliph, participated, in, a, large, scale, sacrifice, in, the, palace, courtyard, afterward, the, meat, would, be, divided, and, given, to, the, poor, in, addition, to, these, two, holidays, shias, celebrated, the, birthdays, of, fatimah, and, ali, ibn, abi, talib, matrimonies, and, births, in, the, royal, family, were, observed, by, all, in, the, empire, the, announcement, that, one, of, the, caliph, s, sons, could, recite, the, koran, smoothly, was, greeted, by, communal, jubilation, when, harun, developed, this, holy, talent, the, people, lit, torches, and, decorated, the, streets, with, wreaths, of, flowers, and, his, father, al, mahdi, freed, 500, slaves, of, all, the, holidays, imported, from, other, cultures, and, religions, the, one, most, celebrated, in, baghdad, a, city, with, many, persians, was, nowruz, which, celebrated, the, arrival, of, spring, in, a, ceremonial, ablution, introduced, by, persian, troops, residents, sprinkled, themselves, with, water, and, ate, almond, cakes, the, palaces, of, the, imperial, family, were, lit, up, for, six, days, and, nights, the, abbasids, also, celebrated, the, persian, holiday, of, mihraj, which, marked, the, onset, of, winter, signified, with, pounding, drums, and, sadar, when, homes, burned, incense, and, the, masses, would, congregate, along, the, tigris, to, witness, princes, and, viziers, pass, by, in, baghdad, there, were, many, abbasid, military, leaders, who, were, or, said, they, were, of, arab, descent, however, it, is, clear, that, most, of, the, ranks, were, of, iranian, origin, the, vast, majority, being, from, khorasan, and, transoxiana, not, from, western, iran, or, azerbaijan, most, of, the, khorasani, soldiers, who, brought, the, abbasids, to, power, were, arabs, the, standing, army, of, the, muslims, in, khorasan, was, overwhelmingly, arab, the, unit, organization, of, the, abbasids, was, designed, with, the, goal, of, ethnic, and, racial, equality, among, supporters, when, abu, muslim, recruited, officers, along, the, silk, road, he, registered, them, based, not, on, their, tribal, or, ethno, national, affiliations, but, on, their, current, places, of, residence, under, the, abbasids, iranian, peoples, became, better, represented, in, the, army, and, bureaucracy, as, compared, to, before, the, abbasid, army, was, centred, on, the, khorasan, abna, al, dawla, infantry, and, the, khurasaniyya, heavy, cavalry, led, by, their, own, semi, autonomous, commanders, qa, id, who, recruited, and, deployed, their, own, men, with, abbasid, resource, grants, al, mu, tasim, began, the, practice, of, recruiting, turkic, slave, soldiers, from, the, samanids, into, a, private, army, which, allowed, him, to, take, over, the, reins, of, the, caliphate, he, abolished, the, old, jund, system, created, by, umar, and, diverted, the, salaries, of, the, original, arab, military, descendants, to, the, turkic, slave, soldiers, the, turkic, soldiers, transformed, the, style, of, warfare, as, they, were, known, as, capable, horse, archers, trained, from, childhood, to, ride, this, military, was, now, drafted, from, the, ethnic, groups, of, the, faraway, borderlands, and, were, completely, separate, from, the, rest, of, society, some, could, not, speak, arabic, properly, this, led, to, the, decline, of, the, caliphate, starting, with, the, anarchy, at, samarra, although, the, abbasids, never, retained, a, substantial, regular, army, the, caliph, could, recruit, a, considerable, number, of, soldiers, in, a, short, time, when, needed, from, levies, there, were, also, cohorts, of, regular, troops, who, received, steady, pay, and, a, special, forces, unit, at, any, moment, 125, 000, muslim, soldiers, could, be, assembled, along, the, byzantine, frontier, baghdad, medina, damascus, rayy, and, other, geostrategic, locations, in, order, to, quell, any, unrest, the, cavalry, was, entirely, covered, in, iron, with, helmets, similar, to, medieval, knights, their, only, exposed, spots, were, the, end, of, their, noses, and, small, openings, in, front, of, their, eyes, their, foot, soldiers, were, issued, spears, swords, and, pikes, and, in, line, with, persian, fashion, trained, to, stand, so, solidly, that, one, contemporary, wrote, you, would, have, thought, them, held, fast, by, clamps, of, bronze, the, abbasid, army, amassed, an, array, of, siege, equipment, such, as, catapults, mangonels, battering, rams, ladders, grappling, irons, and, hooks, all, such, weaponry, was, operated, by, military, engineers, however, the, primary, siege, weapon, was, the, manjaniq, a, type, of, siege, weapon, that, was, comparable, to, the, trebuchet, employed, in, western, medieval, times, from, the, seventh, century, onward, it, had, largely, replaced, torsion, artillery, by, harun, al, rashid, s, time, the, abbasid, army, employed, fire, grenades, the, abbasids, also, utilized, field, hospitals, and, ambulances, drawn, by, camels, as, a, result, of, such, a, vast, empire, the, caliphate, was, decentralized, and, divided, into, 24, provinces, harun, s, vizier, enjoyed, close, to, unchecked, powers, under, harun, a, special, bureau, of, confiscation, was, created, this, governmental, wing, made, it, possible, for, the, vizier, to, seize, the, property, and, riches, of, any, corrupt, governor, or, civil, servant, in, addition, it, allowed, governors, to, confiscate, the, estates, of, lower, ranking, officials, finally, the, caliph, could, impose, the, same, penalty, on, a, vizier, who, fell, from, grace, as, one, later, caliph, put, it, the, vizier, is, our, representative, throughout, the, land, and, amongst, our, subjects, therefore, he, who, obeys, him, obeys, us, and, he, who, obeys, us, obeys, god, and, god, shall, cause, him, who, obeys, him, to, enter, paradise, every, regional, metropolis, had, a, post, office, and, hundreds, of, roads, were, paved, in, order, to, link, the, imperial, capital, with, other, cities, and, towns, the, empire, employed, a, system, of, relays, to, deliver, mail, the, central, post, office, in, baghdad, even, had, a, map, with, directions, that, noted, the, distances, between, each, town, the, roads, were, provided, with, roadside, inns, hospices, and, wells, and, could, reach, eastward, through, persia, and, central, asia, to, as, far, as, china, the, post, office, not, only, enhanced, civil, services, but, also, served, as, intelligence, for, the, caliph, mailmen, were, employed, as, spies, who, kept, an, eye, on, local, affairs, early, in, the, days, of, the, caliphate, the, barmakids, took, the, responsibility, of, shaping, the, civil, service, the, family, had, roots, in, a, buddhist, monastery, in, northern, afghanistan, in, the, early, 8th, century, the, family, converted, to, islam, and, began, to, take, on,
