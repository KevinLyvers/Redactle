to, the, french, revolution, s, reign, of, terror, the, purges, were, largely, conducted, by, the, nkvd, people, s, commissariat, for, internal, affairs, which, functioned, as, the, interior, ministry, and, secret, police, of, the, ussr, starting, in, 1936, the, nkvd, under, chief, genrikh, yagoda, began, the, removal, of, the, central, party, leadership, old, bolsheviks, government, officials, and, regional, party, bosses, soviet, politicians, who, opposed, or, criticized, stalin, were, removed, from, office, and, imprisoned, or, executed, by, the, nkvd, eventually, the, purges, were, expanded, to, the, red, army, and, military, high, command, which, had, a, disastrous, effect, on, the, military, the, campaigns, also, affected, many, other, categories, of, the, society, intelligentsia, wealthy, peasants, especially, those, lending, out, money, or, wealth, kulaks, and, professionals, as, the, scope, of, the, purge, widened, the, omnipresent, suspicion, of, saboteurs, and, counter, revolutionaries, began, affecting, civilian, life, the, purge, reached, its, peak, between, september, 1936, and, august, 1938, under, the, leadership, of, nikolai, yezhov, hence, the, name, yezhovshchina, the, campaigns, were, carried, out, according, to, the, general, line, of, the, party, often, by, direct, orders, of, the, politburo, headed, by, stalin, hundreds, of, thousands, of, victims, were, accused, of, various, political, crimes, espionage, wrecking, sabotage, anti, soviet, agitation, conspiracies, to, prepare, uprisings, and, coups, they, were, executed, by, shooting, or, sent, to, the, gulag, labor, camps, many, died, at, the, penal, labor, camps, of, starvation, disease, exposure, and, overwork, the, nkvd, targeted, certain, ethnic, minorities, such, as, the, volga, germans, and, soviet, citizens, of, polish, origin, who, were, subjected, to, forced, deportation, and, extreme, repression, throughout, the, purge, the, nkvd, sought, to, strengthen, control, over, civilians, through, fear, and, frequently, used, imprisonment, torture, violent, interrogation, and, executions, during, its, mass, operations, in, 1938, stalin, reversed, his, stance, on, the, purges, criticized, the, nkvd, for, carrying, out, mass, executions, and, oversaw, the, execution, of, genrikh, yagoda, and, nikolai, yezhov, who, headed, the, nkvd, during, the, purge, years, scholars, estimate, the, death, toll, for, the, great, purge, 1936, 1938, to, be, roughly, 700, 000, 1, 2, million, despite, the, end, of, the, great, purge, the, widespread, surveillance, and, atmosphere, of, mistrust, continued, for, decades, similar, purges, took, place, in, mongolia, and, xinjiang, while, the, soviet, government, desired, to, put, trotsky, on, trial, during, the, purge, his, exile, prevented, this, trotsky, survived, the, purge, though, he, would, be, assassinated, in, 1940, by, the, nkvd, on, the, orders, of, stalin, following, the, death, of, vladimir, lenin, in, 1924, a, power, vacuum, opened, in, the, communist, party, the, ruling, party, in, the, soviet, union, ussr, various, established, figures, in, lenin, s, government, attempted, to, succeed, him, by, 1928, joseph, stalin, the, party, s, general, secretary, had, triumphed, over, his, opponents, and, gained, control, of, the, party, initially, stalin, s, leadership, was, widely, accepted, his, main, political, adversary, trotsky, was, forced, into, exile, in, 1929, and, stalin, s, doctrine, of, socialism, in, one, country, became, enshrined, party, policy, however, in, the, early, 1930s, party, officials, began, to, lose, faith, in, his, leadership, largely, due, to, the, human, cost, of, the, first, five, year, plan, and, the, collectivization, of, agriculture, from, 1930, onwards, the, party, and, police, officials, feared, the, social, disorder, caused, by, the, upheavals, of, forced, collectivization, of, peasants, and, the, resulting, famine, of, 1932, 1933, as, well, as, the, massive, and, uncontrolled, migration, of, millions, of, peasants, into, cities, the, threat, of, war, heightened, stalin, s, and, generally, soviet, perception, of, marginal, and, politically, suspect, populations, as, the, potential, source, of, an, uprising, in, case, of, invasion, stalin, began, to, plan, for, the, preventive, elimination, of, such, potential, recruits, for, a, mythical, fifth, column, of, wreckers, terrorists, and, spies, the, term, purge, in, soviet, political, slang, was, an, abbreviation, of, the, expression, purge, of, the, party, ranks, in, 1933, for, example, the, party, expelled, some, 400, 000, people, but, from, 1936, until, 1953, the, term, changed, its, meaning, because, being, expelled, from, the, party, came, to, mean, almost, certain, arrest, imprisonment, and, often, execution, the, political, purge, was, primarily, an, effort, by, stalin, to, eliminate, challenge, from, past, and, potential, opposition, groups, including, the, left, and, right, wings, led, by, leon, trotsky, and, nikolai, bukharin, respectively, following, the, civil, war, and, reconstruction, of, the, soviet, economy, in, the, late, 1920s, veteran, bolsheviks, no, longer, thought, necessary, the, temporary, wartime, dictatorship, which, had, passed, from, lenin, to, stalin, stalin, s, opponents, inside, the, communist, party, chided, him, as, undemocratic, and, lax, on, bureaucratic, corruption, this, opposition, to, current, leadership, may, have, accumulated, substantial, support, among, the, working, class, by, attacking, the, privileges, and, luxuries, the, state, offered, to, its, high, paid, elite, the, ryutin, affair, seemed, to, vindicate, stalin, s, suspicions, ryutin, was, working, with, the, even, larger, secret, opposition, bloc, in, which, leon, trotsky, and, grigori, zinoviev, participated, and, which, later, led, to, both, of, their, deaths, stalin, enforced, a, ban, on, party, factions, and, banned, those, party, members, who, had, opposed, him, effectively, ending, democratic, centralism, in, the, new, form, of, party, organization, the, politburo, and, stalin, in, particular, were, the, sole, dispensers, of, ideology, this, required, the, elimination, of, all, marxists, with, different, views, especially, those, among, the, prestigious, old, guard, of, revolutionaries, as, the, purges, began, the, government, through, the, nkvd, shot, bolshevik, heroes, including, mikhail, tukhachevsky, and, b, la, kun, as, well, as, the, majority, of, lenin, s, politburo, for, disagreements, in, policy, the, nkvd, attacked, the, supporters, friends, and, family, of, these, heretical, marxists, whether, they, lived, in, russia, or, not, the, nkvd, nearly, annihilated, trotsky, s, family, before, killing, him, in, mexico, the, nkvd, agent, ram, n, mercader, was, part, of, an, assassination, task, force, put, together, by, special, agent, pavel, sudoplatov, under, the, personal, orders, of, stalin, by, 1934, several, of, stalin, s, rivals, such, as, trotsky, began, calling, for, stalin, s, removal, and, attempted, to, break, his, control, over, the, party, in, this, atmosphere, of, doubt, and, suspicion, the, popular, high, ranking, official, sergei, kirov, was, assassinated, the, assassination, in, december, 1934, led, to, an, investigation, that, revealed, a, network, of, party, members, supposedly, working, against, stalin, including, several, of, stalin, s, rivals, many, of, those, arrested, after, kirov, s, murder, high, ranking, party, officials, among, them, also, confessed, plans, to, kill, stalin, himself, the, validity, of, these, confessions, is, debated, by, historians, but, there, is, consensus, that, kirov, s, death, was, the, flashpoint, at, which, stalin, decided, to, take, action, and, begin, the, purges, some, later, historians, came, to, believe, that, stalin, arranged, the, murder, or, at, least, that, there, was, sufficient, evidence, to, reach, such, a, conclusion, kirov, was, a, staunch, stalin, loyalist, but, stalin, may, have, viewed, him, as, a, potential, rival, because, of, his, emerging, popularity, among, the, moderates, the, 1934, party, congress, elected, kirov, to, the, central, committee, with, only, three, votes, against, the, fewest, of, any, candidate, while, stalin, received, 292, votes, against, after, kirov, s, assassination, the, nkvd, charged, the, ever, growing, group, of, former, oppositionists, with, kirov, s, murder, as, well, as, a, growing, list, of, other, offenses, including, treason, terrorism, sabotage, and, espionage, another, justification, for, the, purge, was, to, remove, any, possible, fifth, column, in, case, of, a, war, vyacheslav, molotov, and, lazar, kaganovich, participants, in, the, repression, as, members, of, the, politburo, maintained, this, justification, throughout, the, purge, they, each, signed, many, death, lists, stalin, believed, war, was, imminent, threatened, both, by, an, explicitly, hostile, germany, and, an, expansionist, japan, the, soviet, press, portrayed, the, country, as, threatened, from, within, by, fascist, spies, from, the, october, revolution, onward, lenin, had, used, repression, against, perceived, and, legitimate, enemies, of, the, bolsheviks, as, a, systematic, method, of, instilling, fear, and, facilitating, control, over, the, population, in, a, campaign, called, the, red, terror, as, the, russian, civil, war, drew, to, a, close, this, campaign, was, relaxed, although, the, secret, police, did, remain, active, from, 1924, to, 1928, the, mass, repression, including, incarceration, in, the, gulag, system, dropped, significantly, by, 1929, stalin, had, defeated, his, political, opponents, and, gained, full, control, over, the, party, he, organized, a, committee, to, begin, the, process, of, industrialization, of, the, soviet, union, backlash, against, industrialization, and, the, collectivization, of, agriculture, escalated, which, prompted, stalin, to, increase, police, presence, in, rural, areas, soviet, authorities, increased, repression, against, the, kulaks, i, e, wealthy, peasants, that, owned, farmland, in, a, policy, called, dekulakization, the, kulaks, responded, by, destroying, crop, yields, and, other, acts, of, sabotage, against, the, soviet, government, the, food, shortage, led, to, a, mass, famine, across, the, ussr, and, slowed, the, five, year, plan, a, distinctive, feature, of, the, great, purge, was, that, for, the, first, time, members, of, the, ruling, party, were, included, on, a, massive, scale, as, victims, of, the, repression, in, addition, to, ordinary, citizens, prominent, members, of, the, communist, party, were, also, targets, for, the, purges, the, purge, of, the, party, was, accompanied, by, the, purge, of, the, whole, society, soviet, historians, organize, the, great, purge, into, three, corresponding, trials, the, following, events, are, used, for, the, demarcation, of, the, period, between, 1936, and, 1938, three, very, large, moscow, trials, of, former, senior, communist, party, leaders, were, held, in, which, they, were, accused, of, conspiring, with, fascist, and, capitalist, powers, to, assassinate, stalin, and, other, soviet, leaders, dismember, the, soviet, union, and, restore, capitalism, these, trials, were, highly, publicized, and, extensively, covered, by, the, outside, world, which, was, mesmerized, by, the, spectacle, of, lenin, s, closest, associates, confessing, to, most, outrageous, crimes, and, begging, for, death, sentences, it, is, now, known, that, the, confessions, were, given, only, after, great, psychological, pressure, and, torture, had, been, applied, to, the, defendants, from, the, accounts, of, former, ogpu, officer, alexander, orlov, and, others, the, methods, used, to, extract, the, confessions, are, known, such, tortures, as, repeated, beatings, simulated, drownings, making, prisoners, stand, or, go, without, sleep, for, days, on, end, and, threats, to, arrest, and, execute, the, prisoners, families, for, example, kamenev, s, teenage, son, was, arrested, and, charged, with, terrorism, after, months, of, such, interrogation, the, defendants, were, driven, to, despair, and, exhaustion, zinoviev, and, kamenev, demanded, as, a, condition, for, confessing, a, direct, guarantee, from, the, politburo, that, their, lives, and, that, of, their, families, and, followers, would, be, spared, this, offer, was, accepted, but, when, they, were, taken, to, the, alleged, politburo, meeting, only, stalin, kliment, voroshilov, and, yezhov, were, present, stalin, claimed, that, they, were, the, commission, authorized, by, the, politburo, and, gave, assurances, that, death, sentences, would, not, be, carried, out, after, the, trial, stalin, not, only, broke, his, promise, to, spare, the, defendants, he, had, most, of, their, relatives, arrested, and, shot, in, may, 1937, the, commission, of, inquiry, into, the, charges, made, against, leon, trotsky, in, the, moscow, trials, commonly, known, as, the, dewey, commission, was, set, up, in, the, united, states, by, supporters, of, trotsky, to, establish, the, truth, about, the, trials, the, commission, was, headed, by, the, noted, american, philosopher, and, educator, john, dewey, although, the, hearings, were, obviously, conducted, with, a, view, to, proving, trotsky, s, innocence, they, brought, to, light, evidence, which, established, that, some, of, the, specific, charges, made, at, the, trials, could, not, be, true, for, example, georgy, pyatakov, testified, that, he, had, flown, to, oslo, in, december, 1935, to, receive, terrorist, instructions, from, trotsky, the, dewey, commission, established, that, no, such, flight, had, taken, place, another, defendant, ivan, smirnov, confessed, to, taking, part, in, the, assassination, of, sergei, kirov, in, december, 1934, at, a, time, when, he, had, already, been, in, prison, for, a, year, the, dewey, commission, later, published, its, findings, in, a, 422, page, book, titled, not, guilty, its, conclusions, asserted, the, innocence, of, all, those, condemned, in, the, moscow, trials, in, its, summary, the, commission, wrote, independent, of, extrinsic, evidence, the, commission, finds, the, commission, concluded, we, therefore, find, the, moscow, trials, to, be, frame, ups, in, the, second, trial, karl, radek, testified, that, there, was, a, third, organization, separate, from, the, cadres, which, had, passed, through, school, as, well, as, semi, trotskyites, quarter, trotskyites, one, eighth, trotskyites, people, who, helped, us, not, knowing, of, the, terrorist, organization, but, sympathizing, with, us, people, who, from, liberalism, from, a, fronde, against, the, party, gave, us, this, help, by, the, third, organization, he, meant, the, last, remaining, former, opposition, group, called, the, rightists, led, by, bukharin, whom, he, implicated, by, saying, i, feel, guilty, of, one, thing, more, even, after, admitting, my, guilt, and, exposing, the, organisation, i, stubbornly, refused, to, give, evidence, about, bukharin, i, knew, that, bukharin, s, situation, was, just, as, hopeless, as, my, own, because, our, guilt, if, not, juridically, then, in, essence, was, the, same, but, we, are, close, friends, and, intellectual, friendship, is, stronger, than, other, friendships, i, knew, that, bukharin, was, in, the, same, state, of, upheaval, as, myself, that, is, why, i, did, not, want, to, deliver, him, bound, hand, and, foot, to, the, people, s, commissariat, of, home, affairs, just, as, in, relation, to, our, other, cadres, i, wanted, bukharin, himself, to, lay, down, his, arms, the, third, and, final, trial, in, march, 1938, known, as, the, trial, of, the, twenty, one, is, the, most, famous, of, the, soviet, show, trials, because, of, persons, involved, and, the, scope, of, charges, which, tied, together, all, loose, threads, from, earlier, trials, meant, to, be, the, culmination, of, previous, trials, it, included, 21, defendants, alleged, to, belong, to, the, bloc, of, rightists, and, trotskyites, supposedly, led, by, nikolai, bukharin, the, former, chairman, of, the, communist, international, former, premier, alexei, rykov, christian, rakovsky, nikolai, krestinsky, and, genrikh, yagoda, recently, disgraced, head, of, the, nkvd, although, an, opposition, bloc, led, by, trotsky, and, with, zinovievites, really, existed, pierre, brou, asserts, that, bukharin, was, not, involved, differently, from, brou, one, of, his, former, allies, jules, humbert, droz, said, in, his, memoirs, that, bukharin, told, him, that, he, formed, a, secret, bloc, with, zinoviev, and, kamenev, in, order, to, remove, stalin, from, leadership, the, fact, that, yagoda, was, one, of, the, accused, showed, the, speed, at, which, the, purges, were, consuming, their, own, it, was, now, alleged, that, bukharin, and, others, sought, to, assassinate, lenin, and, stalin, from, 1918, murder, maxim, gorky, by, poison, partition, the, ussr, and, hand, its, territories, to, germany, japan, and, great, britain, and, other, charges, even, previously, sympathetic, observers, who, had, accepted, the, earlier, trials, found, it, more, difficult, to, accept, these, new, allegations, as, they, became, ever, more, absurd, and, the, purge, expanded, to, include, almost, every, living, old, bolshevik, leader, except, stalin, and, kalinin, no, other, crime, of, the, stalin, years, so, captivated, western, intellectuals, as, the, trial, and, execution, of, bukharin, who, was, a, marxist, theorist, of, international, standing, for, some, prominent, communists, such, as, bertram, wolfe, jay, lovestone, arthur, koestler, and, heinrich, brandler, the, bukharin, trial, marked, their, final, break, with, communism, and, even, turned, the, first, three, into, fervent, anti, communists, eventually, to, them, bukharin, s, confession, symbolized, the, depredations, of, communism, which, not, only, destroyed, its, sons, but, also, conscripted, them, in, self, destruction, and, individual, abnegation, on, the, first, day, of, trial, krestinsky, caused, a, sensation, when, he, repudiated, his, written, confession, and, pleaded, not, guilty, to, all, the, charges, however, he, changed, his, plea, the, next, day, after, special, measures, which, dislocated, his, left, shoulder, among, other, things, anastas, mikoyan, and, vyacheslav, molotov, later, claimed, that, bukharin, was, never, tortured, but, it, is, now, known, that, his, interrogators, were, given, the, order, beating, permitted, and, were, under, great, pressure, to, extract, confession, out, of, the, star, defendant, bukharin, initially, held, out, for, three, months, but, threats, to, his, young, wife, and, infant, son, combined, with, methods, of, physical, influence, wore, him, down, but, when, he, read, his, confession, amended, and, corrected, personally, by, stalin, he, withdrew, his, whole, confession, the, examination, started, all, over, again, with, a, double, team, of, interrogators, bukharin, s, confession, in, particular, became, subject, of, much, debate, among, western, observers, inspiring, koestler, s, acclaimed, novel, darkness, at, noon, and, philosophical, essay, by, maurice, merleau, ponty, in, humanism, and, terror, his, confessions, were, somewhat, different, from, others, in, that, while, he, pleaded, guilty, to, sum, total, of, crimes, he, denied, knowledge, when, it, came, to, specific, crimes, some, astute, observers, noted, that, he, would, allow, only, what, was, in, written, confession, and, refuse, to, go, any, further, the, result, was, a, curious, mix, of, fulsome, confessions, of, being, a, degenerate, fascist, working, for, restoration, of, capitalism, and, subtle, criticisms, of, the, trial, one, observer, noted, that, after, disproving, several, charges, against, him, bukharin, proceeded, to, demolish, or, rather, showed, he, could, very, easily, demolish, the, whole, case, he, continued, by, saying, that, the, confession, of, the, accused, is, not, essential, the, confession, of, the, accused, is, a, medieval, principle, of, jurisprudence, in, a, trial, that, was, based, solely, on, confessions, he, finished, his, last, plea, with, the, words, he, monstrousness, of, my, crime, is, immeasurable, especially, in, the, new, stage, of, struggle, of, the, u, s, s, r, may, this, trial, be, the, last, severe, lesson, and, may, the, great, might, of, the, u, s, s, r, become, clear, to, all, romain, rolland, and, others, wrote, to, stalin, seeking, clemency, for, bukharin, but, all, the, leading, defendants, were, executed, except, rakovsky, and, two, others, who, were, killed, in, nkvd, prisoner, massacres, in, 1941, despite, the, promise, to, spare, his, family, bukharin, s, wife, anna, larina, was, sent, to, a, labor, camp, but, she, survived, to, see, her, husband, posthumously, rehabilitated, a, half, century, later, by, the, soviet, state, under, mikhail, gorbachev, in, 1988, on, 2, july, 1937, in, a, top, secret, order, to, regional, party, and, nkvd, chiefs, stalin, instructed, them, to, produce, the, estimated, number, of, kulaks, and, criminals, in, their, districts, these, individuals, were, to, be, arrested, and, executed, or, sent, to, the, gulag, camps, the, party, chiefs, complied, and, produced, these, lists, within, days, with, figures, which, roughly, corresponded, to, the, individuals, who, were, already, under, secret, police, surveillance, on, 30, july, 1937, the, nkvd, order, no, 00447, was, issued, directed, against, ex, kulaks, and, other, anti, soviet, elements, such, as, former, officials, of, the, tsarist, regime, former, members, of, political, parties, other, than, the, communist, party, etc, they, were, to, be, executed, or, sent, to, gulag, prison, camps, extrajudicially, under, the, decisions, of, nkvd, troikas, the, following, categories, appear, to, have, been, on, index, cards, catalogues, of, suspects, assembled, over, the, years, by, the, nkvd, and, were, systematically, tracked, down, ex, kulaks, previously, deported, to, special, settlements, in, inhospitable, parts, of, the, country, siberia, the, urals, kazakhstan, and, the, far, north, former, tsarist, civil, servants, former, officers, of, the, white, army, participants, in, peasant, rebellions, members, of, the, clergy, persons, deprived, of, voting, rights, former, members, of, non, bolshevik, parties, ordinary, criminals, like, thieves, known, to, the, police, and, various, other, socially, harmful, elements, however, a, large, number, of, people, were, arrested, at, random, in, sweeps, on, the, basis, of, denunciations, or, because, they, were, related, to, were, friends, with, or, knew, people, already, arrested, engineers, peasants, railwaymen, and, other, types, of, workers, were, arrested, during, the, kulak, operation, based, on, the, fact, that, they, worked, for, or, near, important, strategic, sites, and, factories, where, work, accidents, had, occurred, due, to, frantic, rhythms, and, plans, during, this, period, the, nkvd, reopened, these, cases, and, relabeled, them, as, sabotage, or, wrecking, the, orthodox, clergy, including, active, parishioners, was, nearly, annihilated, 85, of, the, 35, 000, members, of, the, clergy, were, arrested, particularly, vulnerable, to, repression, were, also, the, so, called, special, settlers, spetzpereselentsy, who, were, under, permanent, police, surveillance, and, constituted, a, huge, pool, of, potential, enemies, to, draw, on, at, least, 100, 000, of, them, were, arrested, in, the, course, of, the, great, terror, common, criminals, such, as, thieves, violators, of, the, passport, regime, etc, were, also, dealt, with, in, a, summary, way, in, moscow, for, example, nearly, one, third, of, the, 20, 765, persons, executed, on, the, butovo, firing, range, were, charged, with, a, non, political, criminal, offence, to, carry, out, the, mass, arrests, the, 25, 000, officers, of, the, state, security, personnel, of, nkvd, were, complemented, with, units, of, ordinary, police, and, komsomol, young, communist, league, and, civilian, communist, party, members, seeking, to, fulfill, the, quotas, the, police, rounded, up, people, in, markets, and, train, stations, with, the, purpose, of, arresting, social, outcasts, local, units, of, the, nkvd, in, order, to, meet, their, casework, minimums, and, force, confessions, out, of, arrestees, worked, long, uninterrupted, shifts, during, which, they, interrogated, tortured, and, beat, the, prisoners, in, many, cases, those, arrested, were, forced, to, sign, blank, pages, which, were, later, filled, in, with, a, fabricated, confession, by, the, interrogators, after, the, interrogations, the, files, were, submitted, to, nkvd, troikas, which, pronounced, the, verdicts, in, the, absence, of, the, accused, during, a, half, day, long, session, a, troika, went, through, several, hundred, cases, delivering, either, a,

though, this, may, have, been, due, to, the, gulag, camp, s, lack, of, space, in, the, late, stages, of, the, purge, rather, than, deliberate, discrimination, in, sentencing, the, wives, and,

elites, who, are, referred, to, as, the, executed, renaissance, statistics, of, ukraine, s, ministry, of, foreign, affairs, indicate, that, about, 200, 000, victims, of, the, great, purge, were, ukrainians, concerning, diaspora, minorities, the, vast, majority, of, whom, were, soviet, citizens, and, whose, ancestors, had, resided, for, decades, and, sometimes, centuries, in, the, soviet,

sufficient, justification, for, their, arrest, and, execution, martin, 2001, 338, some, scholars, have, called, the, national, operations, of, the, nkvd, genocidal, norman, naimark, called, stalin, s, policy, towards, poles, in, the, 1930s, genocidal, however, he, does, not, consider, the, great, purge, entirely, genocidal, because, it, also, targeted, political, opponents, some, scholars, however, focus, on, the, security, dilemma, in, the, border, areas, suggesting, the, need, to, secure, the, ethnic, integrity, of, soviet, space, vis, vis, neighboring, capitalistic, enemy, states, they, stress, the, role, of, international, relations, and, believe, that, representatives, of, these, minorities, were, killed, not, because, of, their, ethnicity, but, because, of, their, possible, relations, to, countries, hostile, to, the, ussr, and, fear, of, disloyalty, in, the, case, of, an, invasion, nevertheless, little, proof, exists, to, suggest, that, russia, s, and, stalin, s, alleged, prejudices, played, a, central, causal, role, in, the, great, purge, the, purge, of, the, red, army, and, military, maritime, fleet, removed, three, of, five, marshals, then, equivalent, to,

commissars, at, first, it, was, thought, 25, 50, of, red, army, officers, had, been, purged, the, true, figure, is, now, known, to, be, in, the, area, of, 3, 7, 7, 7, this, discrepancy, was, the, result, of, a, systematic, underestimation, of, the, true, size, of, the, red, army, officer, corps, and, it, was, overlooked, that, most, of, those, purged, were, merely, expelled, from, the, party, thirty, percent, of, officers, purged, in, 1937, 1939, were, allowed, to, return, to, service, the, purge, of, the, army, was, claimed, to, be, supported, by, german, forged, documents, said, to, have, been, correspondence, between, marshal, tukhachevsky, and, members, of, the, german, high, command, the, claim, is, unsupported, by, facts, as, by, the, time, the, documents, were, supposedly, created, two, people, from, the, eight, in, the, tukhachevsky, group, were, already, imprisoned, and, by, the, time, the, document, was, said, to, reach, stalin, the, purging, process, was, already, underway, however, the, actual, evidence, introduced, at, trial, was, obtained, from, forced, confessions, the, purge, had, a, significant, effect, on, german, decision, making, in, world, war, ii, many, german, generals, opposed, an, invasion, of, russia, but, hitler, disagreed, arguing, that, the, red, army, was, less, effective, after, its, intellectual, leadership, had, been, eliminated, in, the, purge, russian, trotskyist, historian, vadim, rogovin, argued, that, stalin, had, destroyed, thousands, of, foreign, communists, capable, of, leading, socialist, change, in, their, respective, countries, he, referenced, 600, active, bulgarian, communists, that, perished, in, his, prison, camps, along, with, the, thousands, of, german, communists, that, were, handed, over, from, stalin, to, the, gestapo, after, the, signing, of, the, german, soviet, pact, rogovin, also, noted, that, sixteen, members, of, the, central, committee, of, the, communist, party, of, germany, became, victims, of, stalinist, terror, repressive, measures, were, also, enforced, upon, the, hungarian, yugoslav, and, other, polish, communist, parties, according, to, historian, eric, d, weitz, 60, of, german, exiles, in, the, soviet, union, were, liquidated, during, the, stalinist, terror, and, a, higher, proportion, of, the, kpd, politburo, membership, had, died, in, the, soviet, union, than, had, died, in, nazi, germany, weitz, also, noted, that, hundreds, of, german, citizens, the, majority, of, whom, were, communists, were, handed, over, to, the, gestapo, from, stalin, s, administration, many, jewish, figures, such, as, alexander, weissberg, cybulski, and, fritz, houtermans, were, arrested, in, 1937, by, the, nkvd, and, turned, over, to, the, german, gestapo, joseph, berger, barzilai, co,

conducted, in, spain, in, which, the, nkvd, oversaw, purges, of, anti, stalinist, elements, in, the, spanish, republican, forces, including, trotskyist, and, anarchist, factions, notable, cases, involved, the, execution, of, andreu, nin, spanish, poum, and, former, government, minister, jose, robles, a, left, wing, academic, and, translator, along, with, many, members, of, the, poum, faction, eventually, almost, all, of, the, bolsheviks, who, had, played, prominent, roles, during, the, russian, revolution, or, in, lenin, s, soviet, government, were, executed, out, of, six, members, of, the, original, politburo, during, the, october, revolution, who, lived, until, the, great, purge, stalin, himself, was, the, only, one, who, remained, in, the, soviet, union, alive, four, of, the, other, five, were, executed, the, fifth, leon, trotsky, had, been, forced, into, exile, outside, the, soviet, union, in, 1929, but, was, assassinated, in, mexico, by, soviet, agent, ram, n, mercader,

molotov, and, kalinin, lived, while, being, the, most, visible, part, the, trials, and, executions, of, the, former, bolshevik, leaders, were, only, a, minor, aspect, of, the, purges, a, series, of, documents, discovered, in, the, central, committee, archives, in, 1992, by, vladimir, bukovsky, demonstrate, that, there, were, limits, for, arrests, and, executions, as, for, all, other, activities, in, the, planned, economy, the, victims, were, convicted, in, absentia, and, in, camera, by, extrajudicial, organs, the, nkvd, troikas, sentenced, indigenous, enemies, under, nkvd, order, no, 00447,

the, mass, operations, of, the, nkvd, was, flexibility, first, the, numbers, the, so, called, limit, could, be, easily, increased, second, it, was, left, entirely, to, the, nkvd, officers, whether, a, particular, prisoner, was, to, be, shot, or, sent, to, the, prison, camps, third, the, time, limits, set, for, the, completion, of, single, operations, were, extended, time, and, again, the, victims, were, executed, at, night, either, in, prisons, in, the, cellars, of, nkvd, headquarters, or, in, a, secluded, area, usually, a, forest, the, nkvd, officers, shot, prisoners, in, the, head, using,

1938, a, lesser, terror, continued, in, the, 1940s, aleksandr, solzhenitsyn, a, soviet, army, officer, who, became, a, prisoner, for, a, decade, in, the, gulag, system, presents, in, the, gulag, archipelago, his, view, of, the, timeline, of, all, the, leninist, and, stalinist, purges, 1918, 1956, in, which, the, 1936, 1938, purge, may, have, been, simply, the, one, that, got, the, most, attention, from, people, in, a, position, to, record, its, magnitude, for, posterity, the, intelligentsia, by, directly, targeting, them, whereas, several, other, waves, of, the, ongoing, flow, of, purges, such, as, the, first, five, year, plan, of, 1928, 1933, s, collectivization, and, dekulakization, were, just, as, huge, and, just, as, devoid, of, justice, but, were, more, successfully, swallowed, into, oblivion, in, the, popular, memory, of, the, surviving, soviet, public, in, some, cases, high, military, command, arrested, under, yezhov, were, later, executed, under, beria, some, examples, include, marshal, of, the, soviet, union, alexander, yegorov, arrested, in, april, 1938, and, shot, or, died, from, torture, in, february, 1939, his, wife, g, a, yegorova, was, shot, in,

arrested, august, 1938, and, shot, march, 1939, all, the, aforementioned, have, been, posthumously, rehabilitated, when, the, relatives, of, those, who, had, been, executed, in, 1937, 1938, inquired, about, their, fate, they, were, told, by, nkvd, that, their, arrested, relatives, had, been, sentenced, to, 10, years, without, the, right, of, correspondence, when, these, ten, year, periods, elapsed, in, 1947, 1948, but, the, arrested, did, not, appear, the, relatives, asked, mgb, about, their, fate, again, and, this, time, were, told, that, the, arrested, died, in, imprisonment, although, the, trials, of, former, soviet, leaders, were, widely, publicized, the, hundreds, of, thousands, of, other, arrests, and, executions, were, not, these, became, known, in, the, west, only, as, a, few, former, gulag, inmates, reached, the, west, with, their, stories, not, only, did, foreign, correspondents, from, the, west, fail, to, report, on, the, purges, but, in, many, western, nations, especially, france, attempts, were, made, to, silence, or, discredit, these, witnesses, according, to, robert, conquest, jean, paul, sartre, took, the, position, that, evidence, of, the, camps, should, be, ignored, so, the, french, proletariat, would, not, be, discouraged, a, series, of, legal, actions, ensued, at, which, definitive, evidence, was, presented, that, established, the, validity, of, the, former, labor, camp, inmates, testimony, according, to, robert, conquest, in, his, 1968, book, the, great, terror, stalin, s, purge, of, the, thirties, with, respect, to, the, trials, of, former, leaders, some, western, observers, were, unintentionally, or, intentionally, ignorant, of, the, fraudulent, nature, of, the, charges, and, evidence, notably, walter, duranty, of, the, new, york, times, a, russian, speaker, the, american, ambassador, joseph, e, davies, who, reported, proof, beyond, reasonable, doubt, to, justify, the, verdict, of, treason, and, beatrice, and, sidney, webb, authors, of, soviet, communism, a, new, civilization, while, communist, parties, everywhere, simply, transmitted, the, soviet, line, some, of, the, most, critical, reporting, also, came, from, the, left, notably, the, manchester, guardian, the, american, journalist, h, r, knickerbocker, also, reported, on, the, executions, he, called, them, in, 1941, the, great, purges, and, described, how, over, four, years, they, affected, the, top, fourth, or, fifth, to, estimate, it, conservatively, of, the, party, itself, of, the, army, navy, and, air, force, leaders, and, then, of, the, new, bolshevik, intelligentsia, the, foremost, technicians, managers, supervisors, scientists, knickerbocker, also, wrote, about, dekulakization, it, is, a, conservative, estimate, to, say, that, some, 5, 000, 000, died, at, once, or, within, a, few, years, evidence, and, the, results, of, research, began, to, appear, after, stalin, s, death, this, revealed, the, full, enormity, of, the, purges, the, first, of, these, sources, were, the, revelations, of, nikita, khrushchev, which, particularly, affected, the, american, editors, of, the, communist, party, usa, newspaper, the, daily, worker, who, following, the, lead, of, the, new, york, times, published, the, secret, speech, in, full, the, great, purge, was, denounced, by, soviet, leader, nikita, khrushchev, following, stalin, s, death, in, his, secret, speech, to, the, 20th, cpsu, congress, in, february, 1956, which, was, made, public, a, month, later, khrushchev, referred, to, the, purges, as, an, abuse, of, power, by, stalin, which, resulted, in, enormous, harm, to, the, country, in, the, same, speech, he, recognized, that, many, of, the, victims, were, innocent, and, were, convicted, on, the, basis, of, false, confessions, extracted, by, torture, khrushchev, later, claimed, in, his, memoirs, that, he, had, initiated, the, process, overcoming, objections, and, protests, from, the, rest, of, party, leadership, but, the, transcripts, belie, this, although, they, show, differences, of, opinion, regarding, the, contents, starting, from, 1954, some, of, the, convictions, were, overturned, mikhail, tukhachevsky, and, other, generals, convicted, in, the, trial, of, red, army, generals, were, declared, innocent, rehabilitated, in, 1957, the, former, politburo, members, yan, rudzutak, and, stanislav, kosior, and, many, lower, level, victims, were, also, declared, innocent, in, the, 1950s, nikolai, bukharin, and, others, convicted, in, the, moscow, trials, were, not, rehabilitated, until, as, late, as, 1988, leon, trotsky, considered, a, major, player, in, the, russian, revolution, and, a, major, contributor, to, marxist, theory, was, never, rehabilitated, by, the, ussr, the, book, rehabilitation, the, political, processes, of, the, 1930s, 50s, 30, 50, 1991, contains, a, large, amount, of, newly, presented, original, archive, material, transcripts, of, interrogations, letters, of, convicts, and, photos, the, material, demonstrates, in, detail, how, numerous, show, trials, were, fabricated, official, figures, put, the, total, number, of, documentable, executions, during, the, years, 1937, and, 1938, at, 681, 692, in, addition, to, 116, 000, deaths, in, the, gulag, and, 2, 000, unofficially, killed, in, non, article, 58, shootings, whereas, the, total, estimate, of, deaths, brought, about, by, soviet, repression, during, the, great, purge, ranges, from, 950, 000, to, 1, 2, million, which, includes, executions, deaths, in, detention, and, those, who, died, shortly, after, being, released, from, the, gulag, as, a, result, of, their, treatment, therein, there, were, also, 16, 500, to, 50, 000, deaths, in, the, deportation, of, soviet, koreans, which, correspond, to, the, purge, according, to, robert, conquest, a, practice, of, falsification, for, lowering, the, execution, numbers, was, disguising, executions, with, the, sentence, 10, years, without, the, right, of, correspondence, which, almost, always, meant, execution, all, of, the, bodies, identified, from, the, mass, graves, at, vinnitsa, and, kuropaty, were, of, individuals, who, had, received, this, sentence, despite, this, the, lower, figure, did, roughly, confirm, conquest, s, original, 1968, estimate, of, 700, 000, legal, executions, and, in, the, preface, to, the, 40th, anniversary, edition, of, the, great, terror, conquest, claimed, that, he, had, been, correct, on, the, vital, matter, the, numbers, put, to, death, about, one, million, according, to, j, arch, getty, and, oleg, v, naumov, popular, estimates, of, executions, in, the, great, purges, vary, from, 500, 000, to, 7, million, however, according, to, them, the, archival, evidence, from, the, secret, police, rejects, the, astronomically, high, estimates, often, given, for, the, number, of, terror, victims, and, the, data, available, at, this, point, make, it, clear, that, the, number, shot, in, the, two, worst, purge, years, was, more, likely, in, the, hundreds, of, thousands, than, in, the, millions, according, to, historian, corrina, kuhr, 700, 000, people, were, executed, during, the, great, purge, out, of, the, 2, 5, million, who, were, arrested, professor, n, rard, fran, ois, xavier, estimates, the, same, number, of, people, who, were, sentenced, to, death, however, he, states, that, 1, 3, million, people, were, arrested, the, soviets, themselves, made, their, own, estimates, with, vyacheslav, molotov, saying, the, report, written, by, that, commission, member, says, that, 1, 370, 000, arrests, were, made, in, the, 1930s, that, s, too, many, i, responded, that, the, figures, should, be, thoroughly, reviewed, historians, with, archival, access, have, confirmed, that, stalin, was, intimately, involved, in, the, purge, russian, historian, oleg, v, khlevniuk, states, theories, about, the, elemental, spontaneous, nature, of, the, terror, about, a, loss, of, central, control, over, the, course, of, mass, repression, and, about, the, role, of, regional, leaders, in, initiating, the, terror, are, simply, not, supported, by, the, historical, record, besides, signing, yezhov, s, lists, stalin, sometimes, gave, instructions, concerning, certain, individuals, in, one, instance, he, told, yezhov, isn, t, it, time, to, squeeze, this, gentleman, and, force, him, to, report, on, his, dirty, little, business, where, is, he, in, a, prison, or, a, hotel, in, another, while, reviewing, one, of, yezhov, s, lists, he, added, to, m, i, baranov, s, name, beat, beat, stalin, also, signed, 357, lists, in, 1937, and, 1938, authorizing, executions, of, some, 40, 000, people, and, about, 90, of, these, are, confirmed, to, have, been, shot, this, was, 7, 4, of, those, executed, legally, while, reviewing, one, such, list, stalin, reportedly, muttered, to, no, one, in, particular, who, s, going, to, remember, all, this, riff, raff, in, ten, or, twenty, years, time, no, one, who, remembers, the, names, now, of, the, boyars, ivan, the, terrible, got, rid, of, no, one, stalin, had, ordered, for, 100, 000, buddhist, lamas, in, mongolia, to, be, liquidated, but, the, political, leader, peljidiin, genden, resisted, the, order, it, is, quite, possible, that, yezhov, misled, stalin, about, the, aspects, of, the, purge, process, many, people, at, the, time, and, also, a, few, subsequent, commentators, surmised, that, the, great, purge, wasn, t, started, by, stalin, s, initiative, so, the, idea, got, about, that, the, process, was, entirely, out, of, control, once, it, had, begun, stalin, may, have, failed, to, anticipate, the, catastrophic, excesses, of, the, nkvd, under, yezhov, stalin, also, objected, to, the, large, numbers, of, people, that, yezhov, was, purging, for, example, when, yezhov, announced, that, 200, 000, party, members, were, expelled, stalin, interrupted, him, said, that, they, were, very, many, and, suggested, instead, to, only, expel, 30, 000, and, 600, former, trotskyists, and, zinovievists, which, would, be, a, bigger, victory, stephen, g, wheatcroft, posits, that, while, the, purposive, deaths, caused, by, hitler, constitute, murder, those, caused, under, stalin, fall, into, the, category, of, execution, although, in, terms, of, causing, death, by, criminal, neglect, and, ruthlessness, stalin, probably, exceeded, hitler, wheatcroft, elaborates, stalin, undoubtedly, caused, many, innocent, people, to, be, executed, but, it, seems, likely, that, he, thought, many, of, them, guilty, of, crimes, against, the, state, and, felt, that, the, execution, of, others, would, act, as, a, deterrent, to, the, guilty, he, signed, the, papers, and, insisted, on, documentation, hitler, by, contrast, wanted, to, be, rid, of, the, jews, and, communists, simply, because, they, were, jews, and, communists, he, was, not, concerned, about, making, any, pretence, at, legality, he, was, careful, not, to, sign, anything, on, this, matter, and, was, equally, insistent, on, no, documentation, at, least, two, soviet, commissions, investigated, the, show, trials, after, stalin, s, death, the, first, was, headed, by, molotov, and, included, voroshilov, kaganovich, suslov, furtseva, shvernik, aristov, pospelov, and, rudenko, they, were, given, the, task, to, investigate, the, materials, concerning, bukharin, rykov, zinoviev, tukhachevsky, and, others, the, commission, worked, in, 1956, 1957, while, stating, that, the, accusations, against, tukhachevsky, et, al, should, be, abandoned, it, failed, to, fully, rehabilitate, the, victims, of, the, three, moscow, trials, although, the, final, report, does, contain, an, admission, that, the, accusations, have, not, been, proven, during, the, trials, and, evidence, had, been, produced, by, lies, blackmail, and, use, of, physical, influence, bukharin, rykov, zinoviev, and, others, were, still, seen, as, political, opponents, and, though, the, charges, against, them, were, obviously, false, they, could, not, have, been, rehabilitated, because, for, many, years, they, headed, the, anti, soviet, struggle, against, the, building, of, socialism, in, ussr, the, second, commission, largely, worked, from, 1961, to, 1963, and, was, headed, by, shvernik, shvernik, commission, it, included, shelepin, serdyuk, mironov, rudenko, and, semichastny, the, hard, work, resulted, in, two, massive, reports, which, detailed, the, mechanism, of, falsification, of, the, show, trials, against, bukharin, zinoviev, tukhachevsky, and, many, others, the, commission, based, its, findings, in, large, part, on, eyewitness, testimonies, of, former, nkvd, workers, and, victims, of, repressions, and, on, many, documents, the, commission, recommended, rehabilitating, every, accused, with, the, exceptions, of, radek, and, yagoda, because, radek, s, materials, required, some, further, checking, and, yagoda, was, a, criminal, and, one, of, the, falsifiers, of, the, trials, though, most, of, the, charges, against, him, had, to, be, dropped, too, he, was, not, a, spy, etc, the, commission, stated, stalin, committed, a, very, grave, crime, against, the, communist, party, the, socialist, state, soviet, people, and, worldwide, revolutionary, movement, together, with, stalin, the, responsibility, for, the, abuse, of, law, mass, unwarranted, repressions, and, death, of, many, thousands, of, wholly, innocent, people, also, lies, on, molotov, kaganovich, malenkov, molotov, stated, we, would, have, been, complete, idiots, if, we, had, taken, the, reports, at, their, face, value, we, were, not, idiots, and, that, the, cases, were, reviewed, and, some, people, were, released, in, the, late, 1980s, with, the, formation, of, the, memorial, society, and, similar, organisations, across, the, soviet, union, at, a, time, of, gorbachev, s, glasnost, openness, and, transparency, it, became, possible, not, only, to, speak, about, the, great, terror, but, to, begin, locating, the, killing, grounds, of, 1937, 1938, and, identifying, those, who, lay, buried, there, in, 1988, for, instance, the, mass, graves, at, kurapaty, in, belarus, were, the, site, of, a, clash, between, demonstrators, and, the, police, in, 1990, a, boulder, stone, was, brought, from, the, former, solovki, prison, camp, in, the, white, sea, and, erected, next, to, kgb, headquarters, in, moscow, as, a, memorial, to, all, the, victims, of, political, repression, since, 1917, following, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, many, more, mass, graves, filled, with, executed, victims, of, the, terror, were, discovered, and, turned, into, memorial, sites, some, such, as, the, bykivnia, killing, fields, near, kyiv, are, said, to, contain, up, to, 200, 000, corpses, in, 2007, one, such, site, the, butovo, firing, range, near, moscow, was, turned, into, a, shrine, to, the, victims, of, stalinism, between, august, 1937, and, october, 1938, more, than, 20, 000, people, were, shot, and, buried, there, on, 30, october, 2017, president, vladimir, putin, opened, the, wall, of, sorrow, an, official, but, controversial, recognition, of, the, crimes, of, the, soviet, regime, in, august, 2021, a, mass, grave, containing, between, 5, 000, and, 8, 000, skeletons, was, discovered, in, odesa, ukraine, during, exploration, works, for, a, planned, expansion, of, odesa, international, airport, the, graves, are, believed, to, date, back, to, the, late, 1930s, during, the, purge, the, great, purge, has, provoked, numerous, debates, about, its, purpose, scale, and, mechanisms, according, to, one, interpretation, stalin, s, regime, had, to, maintain, its, citizens, in, a, state, of, fear, and, uncertainty, to, stay, in, power, brzezinski, 1958, robert, conquest, emphasized, stalin, s, paranoia, focused, on, the, moscow, show, trial, of, old, bolsheviks, and, analyzed, the, carefully, planned, and, systematic, destruction, of, the, communist, party, some, others, view, the, great, purge, as, a, crucial, moment, or, rather, the, culmination, of, a, vast, social, engineering, campaign, started, at, the, beginning, of, the, 1930s, hagenloh, 2000, shearer, 2003, werth, 2003, according, to, an, october, 1993, study, published, in, the, american, historical, review, much, of, the, great, purge, was, directed, against, the, widespread, banditry, and, criminal, activity, which, was, occurring, in, the, soviet, union, at, the, time, historian, isaac, deutscher, regarded, the, moscow, trials, as, the, prelude, to, the, destruction, of, an, entire, generation, of, revolutionaries, leon, trotsky, viewed, the, excessive, violence, characteristic, of, the, mass, purges, as, an, ideological, differentiation, between, stalinism, and, bolshevism, he, summarised, his, view, the, present, purge, draws, between, bolshevism, and, stalinism, not, simply, a, bloody, line, but, a, whole, river, of, blood, the, annihilation, of, all, the, older, generation, of, bolsheviks, an, important, part, of, the, middle, generation, which, participated, in, the, civil, war, and, that, part, of, the, youth, that, took, up, most, seriously, the, bolshevik, traditions, shows, not, only, a, political, but, a, thoroughly, physical, incompatibility, between, bolshevism, and, stalinism, how, can, this, not, be, seen, according, to, nikita, khrushchev, s, 1956, speech, on, the, cult, of, personality, and, its, consequences, and, to, historian, robert, conquest, a, great, number, of, accusations, notably, those, presented, at, the, moscow, show, trials, were, based, on, forced, confessions, often, obtained, through, torture, and, on, loose, interpretations, of, article, 58, of, the, rsfsr, penal, code, which, dealt, with, counter, revolutionary, crimes, due, legal, process, as, defined, by, soviet, law, in, force, at, the, time, was, often, largely, replaced, with, summary, proceedings, by, nkvd, troikas, valentin, berezhkov, who, became, stalin, s, interpreter, in, 1941, suggests, parallels, in, his, memoir, between, hitler, s, inner, party, purge, and, stalin, s, mass, repressions, of, old, bolsheviks, military, commanders, and, intellectuals, according, to, historian, james, harris, contemporary, archival, research, pokes, rather, large, holes, in, the, traditional, story, weaved, by, conquest, and, others, his, findings, while, not, exonerating, stalin, or, the, soviet, state, dispel, the, notion, that, the, bloodletting, was, merely, the, result, of, stalin, attempting, to, establish, his, own, personal, dictatorship, evidence, suggests, he, was, committed, to, building, the, socialist, state, envisioned, by, lenin, the, real, motivation, for, the, terror, according, to, harris, was, an, exaggerated, fear, of, counterrevolution, so, what, was, the, motivation, behind, the, terror, the, answers, required, a, lot, more, digging, but, it, gradually, became, clearer, that, the, violence, of, the, late, 1930s, was, driven, by, fear, most, bolsheviks, stalin, among, them, believed, that, the, revolutions, of, 1789, 1848, and, 1871, had, failed, because, their, leaders, hadn, t, adequately, anticipated, the, ferocity, of, the, counter, revolutionary, reaction, from, the, establishment, they, were, determined, not, to, make, the, same, mistake, two, major, lines, of, interpretation, have, emerged, among, historians, one, argues, that, the, purges, reflected, stalin, s, ambitions, his, paranoia, and, his, inner, drive, to, increase, his, power, and, eliminate, potential, rivals, revisionist, historians, explain, the, purges, by, theorizing, that, rival, factions, exploited, stalin, s, paranoia, and, used, terror, to, enhance, their, own, position, peter, whitewood, examines, the, first, purge, directed, at, the, army, and, comes, up, with, a, third, interpretation, that, stalin, and, other, top, leaders, believing, that, they, were, always, surrounded, by, capitalist, enemies, always, worried, about, the, vulnerability, and, loyalty, of, the, red, army, it, was, not, a, ploy, stalin, truly, believed, it, stalin, attacked, the, red, army, because, he, seriously, misperceived, a, serious, security, threat, thus, stalin, seems, to, have, genuinely, believed, that, foreign, backed, enemies, had, infiltrated, the, ranks, and, managed, to, organize, a, conspiracy, at, the, very, heart, of, the, red, army, the, purge, hit, deeply, from, june, 1937, and, november, 1938, removing, 35, 000, many, were, executed, experience, in, carrying, out, the, purge, facilitated, purging, other, key, elements, in, the, wider, soviet, polity, historians, often, cite, the, disruption, as, factors, in, the, red, army, s, disastrous, military, performance, during, the, german, invasion, robert, w, thurston, reports, that, the, purge, was, not, intended, to, subdue, the, soviet, masses, many, of, whom, helped, enact, the, purge, but, to, deal, with, opposition, to, stalin, s, rule, among, the, soviet, elites
