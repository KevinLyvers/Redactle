and, m, nster, they, ended, the, thirty, years, war, 1618, 1648, and, brought, peace, to, the, holy, roman, empire, closing, a, calamitous, period, of, european, history, that, killed, approximately, eight, million, people, holy, roman, emperor, ferdinand, iii, the, kingdoms, of, france, and, sweden, and, their, respective, allies, among, the, princes, of, the, holy, roman, empire, participated, in, the, treaties, the, negotiation, process, was, lengthy, and, complex, talks, took, place, in, two, cities, because, each, side, wanted, to, meet, on, territory, under, its, own, control, a, total, of, 109, delegations, arrived, to, represent, the, belligerent, states, but, not, all, delegations, were, present, at, the, same, time, two, treaties, were, signed, to, end, the, war, in, the, empire, the, treaty, of, m, nster, and, the, treaty, of, osnabr, ck, these, treaties, ended, the, thirty, years, war, in, the, holy, roman, empire, with, the, habsburgs, rulers, of, austria, and, spain, and, their, catholic, allies, on, one, side, battling, the, protestant, powers, sweden, and, certain, holy, roman, principalities, allied, with, france, though, catholic, strongly, anti, habsburg, under, king, louis, xiv, several, scholars, of, international, relations, have, identified, the, peace, of, westphalia, as, the, origin, of, principles, crucial, to, modern, international, relations, collectively, known, as, westphalian, sovereignty, however, some, historians, have, argued, against, this, suggesting, that, such, views, emerged, during, the, nineteenth, and, twentieth, century, in, relation, to, concerns, about, sovereignty, during, that, time, europe, had, been, battered, by, both, the, thirty, years, war, and, the, eighty, years, war, exacting, a, heavy, toll, in, money, and, lives, the, eighty, years, war, was, a, prolonged, struggle, for, the, independence, of, the, protestant, majority, dutch, republic, the, modern, netherlands, supported, by, protestant, majority, england, against, catholic, dominated, spain, and, portugal, the, thirty, years, war, was, the, most, deadly, of, the, european, wars, of, religion, centred, on, the, holy, roman, empire, the, war, which, developed, into, four, phases, included, a, large, number, of, domestic, and, foreign, players, siding, either, with, the, catholic, league, or, the, protestant, union, later, heilbronn, league, the, peace, of, prague, 1635, ended, most, religious, aspects, of, the, war, and, the, french, habsburg, rivalry, took, over, prominence, with, between, 4, 5, million, and, 8, million, dead, in, the, thirty, years, war, alone, and, decades, of, constant, warfare, the, need, for, peace, became, increasingly, clear, peace, negotiations, between, france, and, the, habsburg, emperor, began, in, cologne, in, 1636, these, negotiations, were, initially, blocked, by, cardinal, richelieu, of, france, who, insisted, on, the, inclusion, of, all, his, allies, whether, fully, sovereign, countries, or, states, within, the, holy, roman, empire, in, hamburg, sweden, france, and, the, holy, roman, empire, negotiated, a, preliminary, peace, in, december, 1641, they, declared, that, the, preparations, of, cologne, and, the, treaty, of, hamburg, were, preliminaries, of, an, overall, peace, agreement, the, main, peace, negotiations, took, place, in, westphalia, in, the, neighbouring, cities, of, m, nster, and, osnabr, ck, both, cities, were, maintained, as, neutral, and, demilitarized, zones, for, the, negotiations, in, m, nster, negotiations, took, place, between, the, holy, roman, empire, and, france, as, well, as, between, the, dutch, republic, and, spain, who, on, 30, january, 1648, signed, a, peace, treaty, ending, the, eighty, years, war, that, was, not, part, of, the, peace, of, westphalia, m, nster, had, been, since, its, re, catholicism, in, 1535, a, strictly, mono, denominational, community, it, housed, the, chapter, of, the, prince, bishopric, of, m, nster, only, roman, catholic, worship, was, permitted, while, calvinism, and, lutheranism, were, prohibited, sweden, preferred, to, negotiate, with, the, holy, roman, empire, in, osnabr, ck, which, was, controlled, by, protestant, forces, osnabr, ck, was, a, bi, denominational, lutheran, and, catholic, city, with, two, lutheran, churches, and, two, catholic, churches, the, city, council, was, exclusively, lutheran, and, the, burghers, mostly, so, but, the, city, also, housed, the, catholic, chapter, of, the, prince, bishopric, of, osnabr, ck, and, had, many, other, catholic, inhabitants, osnabr, ck, had, been, subjugated, by, troops, of, the, catholic, league, from, 1628, to, 1633, and, was, then, taken, by, lutheran, sweden, the, peace, negotiations, had, no, exact, beginning, or, end, because, the, 109, delegations, never, met, in, a, plenary, session, instead, various, delegations, arrived, between, 1643, and, 1646, and, left, between, 1647, and, 1649, the, largest, number, of, diplomats, were, present, between, january, 1646, and, july, 1647, delegations, had, been, sent, by, 16, european, states, 66, imperial, states, representing, the, interests, of, 140, imperial, states, and, 27, interest, groups, representing, 38, groups, two, separate, treaties, constituted, the, peace, settlement, the, power, asserted, by, ferdinand, iii, was, stripped, from, him, and, returned, to, the, rulers, of, the, imperial, states, the, rulers, of, the, imperial, states, could, again, choose, their, own, official, religions, catholics, and, lutherans, were, redefined, as, equal, before, the, law, and, calvinism, was, given, legal, recognition, as, an, official, religion, the, independence, of, the, dutch, republic, which, practiced, religious, toleration, also, provided, a, safe, haven, for, european, jews, the, holy, see, was, very, displeased, at, the, settlement, with, pope, innocent, x, calling, it, null, void, invalid, iniquitous, unjust, damnable, reprobate, inane, empty, of, meaning, and, effect, for, all, time, in, the, papal, brief, zelo, domus, dei, the, main, tenets, of, the, peace, of, westphalia, were, the, treaties, did, not, entirely, end, conflicts, arising, out, of, the, thirty, years, war, fighting, continued, between, france, and, spain, until, the, treaty, of, the, pyrenees, in, 1659, the, dutch, portuguese, war, that, had, begun, during, the, iberian, union, between, spain, and, portugal, as, part, of, the, eighty, years, war, went, on, until, 1663, nevertheless, the, peace, of, westphalia, did, settle, many, outstanding, european, issues, of, the, time, some, scholars, of, international, relations, have, identified, the, peace, of, westphalia, as, the, origin, of, principles, crucial, to, modern, international, relations, including, the, inviolability, of, borders, and, non, interference, in, the, domestic, affairs, of, sovereign, states, this, system, became, known, in, the, literature, as, westphalian, sovereignty, most, modern, historians, have, challenged, the, association, of, this, system, with, the, peace, of, westphalia, calling, it, the, westphalian, myth, they, have, challenged, the, view, that, the, modern, european, states, system, originated, with, the, westphalian, treaties, the, treaties, do, not, contain, anything, in, their, text, about, religious, freedom, sovereignty, or, balance, of, power, that, can, be, construed, as, international, law, principles, constitutional, arrangements, of, the, holy, roman, empire, are, the, only, context, in, which, sovereignty, and, religious, equality, are, mentioned, in, the, text, but, they, are, not, new, ideas, in, this, context, while, the, treaties, do, not, contain, the, basis, for, the, modern, laws, of, nations, themselves, they, do, symbolize, the, end, of, a, long, period, of, religious, conflict, in, europe
