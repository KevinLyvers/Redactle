persepolis, p, r, s, p, l, s, old, persian, romanized, p, rsa, new, persian, romanized, takht, e, jamsh, d, lit, throne, of, jamshid, was, the, ceremonial, capital, of, the, achaemenid, empire, c, 550, 330, bc, it, is, situated, in, the, plains, of, marvdasht, encircled, by, the, southern, zagros, mountains, fars, province, of, iran, it, is, one, of, the, key, iranian, cultural, heritage, sites, and, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, since, 1979, the, earliest, remains, of, persepolis, date, back, to, 515, bc, the, city, acting, as, a, major, center, for, the, empire, housed, a, palace, complex, and, citadel, designed, to, serve, as, the, focal, point, for, governance, and, ceremonial, activities, it, exemplifies, the, achaemenid, style, of, architecture, the, complex, was, taken, by, the, army, of, alexander, the, great, in, 330, bc, and, soon, after, its, wooden, parts, were, completely, destroyed, by, fire, likely, deliberately, the, function, of, persepolis, remains, unclear, it, was, not, one, of, the, largest, cities, in, ancient, iran, let, alone, the, rest, of, the, empire, but, appears, to, have, been, a, grand, ceremonial, complex, that, was, only, occupied, seasonally, the, complex, was, raised, high, on, a, walled, platform, with, five, palaces, or, halls, of, varying, size, and, grand, entrances, it, is, still, not, entirely, clear, where, the, king, s, private, quarters, actually, were, until, recently, most, archaeologists, held, that, it, was, primarily, used, for, celebrating, nowruz, the, persian, new, year, held, at, the, spring, equinox, which, is, still, an, important, annual, festivity, in, iran, the, iranian, nobility, and, the, tributary, parts, of, the, empire, came, to, present, gifts, to, the, king, as, represented, in, the, stairway, reliefs, it, is, also, unclear, what, permanent, structures, there, were, outside, the, palace, complex, it, may, be, better, to, think, of, persepolis, as, only, one, complex, rather, than, a, city, in, the, usual, sense, the, exploration, of, persepolis, from, the, early, 17th, century, led, to, the, modern, rediscovery, of, cuneiform, writing, and, from, detailed, studies, of, the, trilingual, achaemenid, royal, inscriptions, found, on, the, ruins, the, initial, decipherment, of, cuneiform, in, the, early, 19th, century, persepolis, is, derived, from, the, greek, persepolis, a, compound, of, p, rs, s, and, p, lis, together, meaning, the, persian, city, or, the, city, of, the, persians, to, the, ancient, persians, the, city, was, known, as, p, rsa, old, persian, which, is, also, the, word, for, the, region, of, persia, an, inscription, left, in, 311, ad, by, sasanian, prince, shapur, sakanshah, the, son, of, hormizd, ii, refers, to, the, site, as, sad, st, n, meaning, hundred, pillars, because, medieval, persians, attributed, the, site, to, jamshid, a, king, from, iranian, mythology, it, has, been, referred, to, as, takht, e, jamshid, persian, taxt, e, jam, d, literally, meaning, throne, of, jamshid, another, name, given, to, the, site, in, the, medieval, period, was, ehel, men, r, persian, forty, minarets, transcribed, as, chilminara, in, de, silva, figueroa, and, as, chilminar, in, early, english, sources, persepolis, is, near, the, small, river, pulvar, which, flows, into, the, kur, river, the, site, includes, a, 125, 000, m, 2, 1, 350, 000, sq, ft, terrace, partly, artificially, constructed, and, partly, cut, out, of, a, mountain, with, its, east, side, leaning, on, rahmat, mountain, archaeological, evidence, shows, that, the, earliest, remains, of, persepolis, date, back, to, 515, bc, andr, godard, the, french, archaeologist, who, excavated, persepolis, in, the, early, 1930s, believed, that, it, was, cyrus, the, great, who, chose, the, site, of, persepolis, but, that, it, was, darius, i, who, built, the, terrace, and, the, palaces, inscriptions, on, these, buildings, support, the, belief, that, they, were, constructed, by, darius, with, darius, i, the, sceptre, passed, to, a, new, branch, of, the, royal, house, the, country, s, true, capitals, were, susa, babylon, and, ecbatana, this, may, be, why, the, greeks, were, not, acquainted, with, the, city, until, alexander, the, great, took, and, plundered, it, darius, i, s, construction, of, persepolis, was, carried, out, parallel, to, that, of, the, palace, of, susa, according, to, gene, r, garthwaite, the, susa, palace, served, as, darius, model, for, persepolis, darius, i, ordered, the, construction, of, the, apadana, and, the, council, hall, tripylon, or, the, triple, gate, as, well, as, the, main, imperial, treasury, and, its, surroundings, these, were, completed, during, the, reign, of, his, son, xerxes, i, further, construction, of, the, buildings, on, the, terrace, continued, until, the, downfall, of, the, achaemenid, empire, according, to, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, the, greek, historian, ctesias, mentioned, that, darius, i, s, grave, was, in, a, cliff, face, that, could, be, reached, with, an, apparatus, of, ropes, around, 519, bc, construction, of, a, broad, stairway, was, begun, grey, limestone, was, the, main, building, material, used, at, persepolis, the, uneven, plan, of, the, terrace, including, the, foundation, acted, like, a, castle, whose, angled, walls, enabled, its, defenders, to, target, any, section, of, the, external, front, after, invading, achaemenid, persia, in, 330, bc, alexander, the, great, sent, the, main, force, of, his, army, to, persepolis, by, the, royal, road, diodorus, siculus, writes, that, on, his, way, to, the, city, alexander, and, his, army, were, met, by, 800, greek, artisans, who, had, been, captured, by, the, persians, most, were, elderly, and, suffered, some, form, of, mutilation, such, as, a, missing, hand, or, foot, they, explained, to, alexander, the, persians, wanted, to, take, advantage, of, their, skills, in, the, city, but, handicapped, them, so, they, could, not, easily, escape, alexander, and, his, staff, were, disturbed, by, the, story, and, provided, the, artisans, with, clothing, and, provisions, before, continuing, on, to, persepolis, diodorus, does, not, cite, this, as, a, reason, for, the, destruction, of, persepolis, but, it, is, possible, alexander, started, to, see, the, city, in, a, negative, light, after, this, encounter, upon, reaching, the, city, alexander, stormed, the, persian, gates, a, pass, through, zagros, mountains, there, ariobarzanes, of, persis, successfully, ambushed, alexander, the, great, s, army, inflicting, heavy, casualties, after, being, held, off, for, 30, days, alexander, the, great, outflanked, and, destroyed, the, defenders, ariobarzanes, himself, was, killed, either, during, the, battle, or, during, the, retreat, to, persepolis, some, sources, indicate, that, the, persians, were, betrayed, by, a, captured, tribal, chief, who, showed, the, macedonians, an, alternate, path, that, allowed, them, to, outflank, ariobarzanes, in, a, reversal, of, thermopylae, after, several, months, alexander, allowed, his, troops, to, loot, persepolis, around, that, time, a, fire, burned, the, palaces, or, the, palace, it, is, believed, that, the, fire, which, destroyed, persepolis, started, from, hadish, palace, which, was, the, living, quarters, of, xerxes, i, and, spread, to, the, rest, of, the, city, it, is, not, clear, if, the, fire, was, an, accident, or, a, deliberate, act, of, revenge, for, the, burning, of, the, acropolis, of, athens, during, the, second, persian, invasion, of, greece, many, historians, argue, that, while, alexander, s, army, celebrated, with, a, symposium, they, decided, to, take, revenge, against, the, persians, if, that, is, so, then, the, destruction, of, persepolis, could, be, both, an, accident, and, a, case, of, revenge, the, fire, may, also, have, had, the, political, purpose, of, destroying, an, iconic, symbol, of, the, persian, monarchy, that, might, have, become, a, focus, for, persian, resistance, several, much, later, greek, and, roman, accounts, including, arrian, diodorus, siculus, and, quintus, curtius, rufus, describe, that, the, burning, was, the, idea, of, tha, s, mistress, of, alexander, s, general, ptolemy, i, soter, and, possibly, of, alexander, himself, she, is, said, to, have, suggested, it, during, a, very, drunken, celebration, according, to, some, accounts, to, revenge, the, destruction, of, greek, sanctuaries, she, was, from, athens, and, either, she, or, alexander, himself, set, the, fire, going, the, book, of, arda, wiraz, a, zoroastrian, work, composed, in, the, 3rd, or, 4th, century, describes, persepolis, archives, as, containing, all, the, avesta, and, zend, written, upon, prepared, cow, skins, and, with, gold, ink, which, were, destroyed, indeed, in, his, chronology, of, the, ancient, nations, the, native, iranian, writer, biruni, indicates, unavailability, of, certain, native, iranian, historiographical, sources, in, the, post, achaemenid, era, especially, during, the, parthian, empire, he, adds, burned, the, whole, of, persepolis, as, revenge, to, the, persians, because, it, seems, the, persian, king, xerxes, had, burnt, the, greek, city, of, athens, around, 150, years, ago, people, say, that, even, at, the, present, time, the, traces, of, fire, are, visible, in, some, places, paradoxically, the, event, that, caused, the, destruction, of, these, texts, may, have, helped, in, the, preservation, of, the, persepolis, administrative, archives, which, might, otherwise, have, been, lost, over, time, to, natural, and, man, made, events, according, to, archaeological, evidence, the, partial, burning, of, persepolis, did, not, affect, what, are, now, referred, to, as, the, persepolis, fortification, archive, tablets, but, rather, may, have, caused, the, eventual, collapse, of, the, upper, part, of, the, northern, fortification, wall, that, preserved, the, tablets, until, their, recovery, by, the, oriental, institute, s, archaeologists, in, 316, bc, persepolis, was, still, the, capital, of, persia, as, a, province, of, the, great, macedonian, empire, see, diodorus, siculus, xix, 21, seq, 46, probably, after, hieronymus, of, cardia, who, was, living, about, 326, the, city, must, have, gradually, declined, in, the, course, of, time, the, lower, city, at, the, foot, of, the, imperial, city, might, have, survived, for, a, longer, time, but, the, ruins, of, the, achaemenids, remained, as, a, witness, to, its, ancient, glory, the, nearby, estakhr, gained, prominence, as, a, separate, city, very, shortly, after, the, decline, of, persepolis, it, appears, that, much, of, persepolis, rubble, was, used, for, the, building, of, istakhr, at, the, time, of, the, muslim, invasion, of, persia, estakhr, offered, a, desperate, resistance, it, was, still, a, place, of, considerable, importance, in, the, first, century, of, islam, although, its, greatness, was, speedily, eclipsed, by, the, new, metropolis, of, shiraz, in, the, 10th, century, estakhr, dwindled, to, insignificance, during, the, following, centuries, estakhr, gradually, declined, until, it, ceased, to, exist, as, a, city, odoric, of, pordenone, may, have, passed, through, persepolis, on, his, way, to, china, in, 1320, although, he, mentioned, only, a, great, ruined, city, called, comerum, in, 1474, giosafat, barbaro, visited, the, ruins, of, persepolis, which, he, incorrectly, thought, were, of, jewish, origin, hakluyt, s, voyages, included, a, general, account, of, the, ruins, of, persepolis, attributed, to, an, english, merchant, who, visited, iran, in, 1568, ant, nio, de, gouveia, from, portugal, wrote, about, cuneiform, inscriptions, following, his, visit, in, 1602, his, report, on, the, ruins, of, persepolis, was, published, as, part, of, his, rela, am, in, 1611, in, 1618, garc, a, de, silva, figueroa, king, philip, iii, of, spain, s, ambassador, to, the, court, of, abbas, i, the, safavid, monarch, was, the, first, western, traveler, to, link, the, site, known, in, iran, as, chehel, minar, as, the, site, known, from, classical, authors, as, persepolis, pietro, della, valle, visited, persepolis, in, 1621, and, noticed, that, only, 25, of, the, 72, original, columns, were, still, standing, due, to, either, vandalism, or, natural, processes, the, dutch, traveler, cornelis, de, bruijn, visited, persepolis, in, 1704, the, fruitful, region, was, covered, with, villages, until, its, frightful, devastation, in, the, 18th, century, and, even, now, it, is, comparatively, speaking, well, cultivated, the, castle, of, estakhr, played, a, conspicuous, part, as, a, strong, fortress, several, times, during, the, muslim, period, it, was, the, middlemost, and, the, highest, of, the, three, steep, crags, which, rise, from, the, valley, of, the, kur, at, some, distance, to, the, west, or, northwest, of, the, necropolis, of, naqsh, e, rustam, the, french, voyagers, eug, ne, flandin, and, pascal, coste, are, among, the, first, to, provide, not, only, a, literary, review, of, the, structure, of, persepolis, but, also, to, create, some, of, the, best, and, earliest, visual, depictions, of, its, structure, in, their, publications, in, paris, in, 1881, and, 1882, titled, voyages, en, perse, de, mm, eugene, flanin, peintre, et, pascal,

accession, of, reza, shah, when, andr, godard, became, the, first, director, of, the, archeological, service, of, iran, in, the, 1800s, a, variety, of, amateur, digging, occurred, at, the, site, in, some, cases, on, a, large, scale, the, first, scientific, excavations, at, persepolis, were, carried, out, by, ernst, herzfeld, and, erich, schmidt, representing, the, oriental, institute, of, the, university, of, chicago, they, conducted, excavations, for, eight, seasons, beginning, in, 1930, and, included, other, nearby, sites, herzfeld, believed, that, the, reasons, behind, the, construction, of, persepolis, were, the, need, for, a, majestic, atmosphere, a, symbol, for, the, empire, and, to, celebrate, special, events, especially, the, nowruz, for, historical, reasons, persepolis, was, built, where, the, achaemenid, dynasty, was, founded, although, it, was, not, the, center, of, the, empire, at, that, time, excavations, of, plaque, fragments, hint, at, a, scene, with, a, contest, between, herakles, and, apollo, dubbed, a, greek, painting, at, persepolis, persepolitan, architecture, is, noted, for, its, use, of, the, persian, column, which, was, probably, based, on, earlier,

the, deposit, did, not, have, any, darics, and, sigloi, which, also, suggests, strongly, that, these, coins, typical, of, achaemenid, coinage, only, started, to, be, minted, later, after, the,

who, called, it, a, ta, ara, which, means, winter, palace, in, old, persian, it, was, then, used, by, artaxerxes, i, in, the, 4th, century, bc, following, his, invasion, of, iran, in, 330, bc, alexander, the, great, allowed, his, troops, to, loot, persepolis, this, palace, was, one, of, the, few, structures, that, escaped, destruction, in, the, burning, of, the, complex, by, alexander, s, army, and, because, of, that, tachara, is, the, most, intact, building, of, persepolis, today, it, is, also, the, oldest, structure, at, persepolis, tachara, stands, back, to, back, to, the, apadana, and, is, oriented, southward, the, hadish, palace, of, xerxes, is, one, of, palaces, at, persepolis, it, s, located, on, the, east, of, the, palace, of, h, artaxerxes, i, the, palace, occupies, the,

are, located, near, the, south, east, corner, of, the, terrace, at, the, foot, of, the, mountain, it, is, commonly, accepted, that, cyrus, the, great, was, buried, in, the, tomb, of, cyrus, in, pasargadae, which, is, mentioned, by, ctesias, as, his, own, city, if, it, is, true, that, the, body, of, cambyses, ii, was, brought, home, to, the, persians, his, burying, place, must, be, somewhere, beside, that, of, his, father, ctesias, assumes, that, it, was, the, custom, for, a, king, to, prepare, his, own, tomb, during, his, lifetime, hence, the, kings, buried, at, naghsh, e, rostam, are, probably, darius, i, xerxes, i, artaxerxes, i, and, darius, ii, xerxes, ii, who, reigned, for, a, very, short, time, could, scarcely, have, obtained, so, splendid, a, monument, and, still, less, could, the, usurper, sogdianus, the, two, completed, graves, behind, the, compound, at, persepolis, would, then, belong, to, artaxerxes, ii, and, artaxerxes, iii, the, unfinished, tomb, a, kilometer, away, from, the, city, is, debated, to, who, it, belongs, there, are, a, total, of, 11, existing, inscriptions, at, persepolis, related, to, darius, the, great, xerxes, artaxerxes, ii, and, artaxerxes, iii, the, relevant, passages, from, ancient, scholars, on, the, subject, are, set, out, below, persepolis, was, the, capital, of, the, persian, kingdom, alexander, described, it, to, the, macedonians, as, the, most, hateful, of, the, cities, of, asia, and, gave, it, over, to, his, soldiers, to, plunder, all, but, the, palaces, 2, it, was, the, richest, city, under, the, sun, and, the, private, houses, had, been, furnished, with, every, sort, of, wealth, over, the, years, the, macedonians, raced, into, it, slaughtering, all, the, men, whom, they, met, and, plundering, the, residences, many, of, the, houses, belonged, to, the, common, people, and, were, abundantly, supplied, with, furniture, and, wearing, apparel, of, every, kind, 72, 1, alexander, held, games, in, honor, of, his, victories, he, performed, costly, sacrifices, to, the, gods, and, entertained, his, friends, bountifully, while, they, were, feasting, and, the, drinking, was, far, advanced, as, they, began, to, be, drunken, a, madness, took, possession, of, the, minds, of, the, intoxicated, guests, 2, at, this, point, one, of, the, women, present, thais, by, name, and, attic, by, origin, said, that, for, alexander, it, would, be, the, finest, of, all, his, feats, in, asia, if, he, joined, them, in, a, triumphal, procession, set, fire, to, the, palaces, and, permitted, women, s, hands, in, a, minute, to, extinguish, the, famed, accomplishments, of, the, persians, 3, this, was, said, to, men, who, were, still, young, and, giddy, with, wine, and, so, as, would, be, expected, someone, shouted, out, to, form, up, and, to, light, torches, and, urged, all, to, take, vengeance, for, the, destruction, of, the, greek, temples, 4, others, took, up, the, cry, and, said, that, this, was, a, deed, worthy, of, alexander, alone, when, the, king, had, caught, fire, at, their, words, all, leaped, up, from, their, couches, and, passed, the, word, along, to, form, a, victory, procession, in, honor, of, dionysius, 5, promptly, many, torches, were, gathered, female, musicians, were, present, at, the, banquet, so, the, king, led, them, all, out, for, the, komos, to, the, sound, of, voices, and, flutes, and, pipes, thais, the, courtesan, leading, the, whole, performance, 6, she, was, the, first, after, the, king, to, hurl, her, blazing, torch, into, the, palace, as, the, others, all, did, the, same, immediately, the, entire, palace, area, was, consumed, so, great, was, the, conflagration, it, was, most, remarkable, that, the, impious, act, of, xerxes, king, of, the, persians, against, the, acropolis, at, athens, should, have, been, repaid, in, kind, after, many, years, by, one, woman, a, citizen, of, the, land, which, had, suffered, it, and, in, sport, on, the, following, day, the, king, called, together, the, leaders, of, his, forces, and, informed, them, that, no, city, was, more, mischievous, to, the, greeks, than, the, seat, of, the, ancient, kings, of, persia, by, its, destruction, they, ought, to, offer, sacrifice, to, the, spirits, of, their, forefathers, 7, 1, but, alexander, s, great, mental, endowments, that, noble, disposition, in, which, he, surpassed, all, kings, that, intrepidity, in, encountering, dangers, his, promptness, in, forming, and, carrying, out, plans, his, good, faith, towards, those, who, submitted, to, him, merciful, treatment, of, his, prisoners, temperance, even, in, lawful, and, usual, pleasures, were, sullied, by, an, excessive, love, of, wine, 2, at, the, very, time, when, his, enemy, and, his, rival, for, a, throne, was, preparing, to, renew, the, war, when, those, whom, he, had, conquered, were, but, lately, subdued, and, were, hostile, to, the, new, rule, he, took, part, in, prolonged, banquets, at, which, women, were, present, not, indeed, those, whom, it, would, be, a, crime, to, violate, but, to, be, sure, harlots, who, were, accustomed, to, live, with, armed, men, with, more, licence, than, was, fitting, 3, one, of, these, thais, by, name, herself, also, drunken, declared, that, the, king, would, win, most, favor, among, all, the, greeks, if, he, should, order, the, palace, of, the, persians, to, be, set, on, fire, that, this, was, expected, by, those, whose, cities, the, barbarians, had, destroyed, 4, when, a, drunken, strumpet, had, given, her, opinion, on, a, matter, of, such, moment, one, or, two, themselves, also, loaded, with, wine, agreed, the, king, too, more, greedy, for, wine, than, able, to, carry, it, cried, why, do, we, not, then, avenge, greece, and, apply, torches, to, the, city, 5, all, had, become, heated, with, wine, and, so, they, arose, when, drunk, to, fire, the, city, which, they, had, spared, when, armed, the, king, was, the, first, to, throw, a, firebrand, upon, the, palace, then, the, guests, and, the, servants, and, courtesans, the, palace, had, been, built, largely, of, cedar, which, quickly, took, fire, and, spread, the, conflagration, widely, 6, when, the, army, which, was, encamped, not, far, from, the, city, saw, the, fire, thinking, it, accidental, they, rushed, to, bear, aid, 7, but, when, they, came, to, the, vestibule, of, the, palace, they, saw, the, king, himself, piling, on, firebrands, therefore, they, left, the, water, which, they, had, brought, and, they, too, began, to, throw, dry, wood, upon, the, burning, building, 8, such, was, the, end, of, the, capital, of, the, entire, orient, 10, the, macedonians, were, ashamed, that, so, renowned, a, city, had, been, destroyed, by, their, king, in, a, drunken, revel, therefore, the, act, was, taken, as, earnest, and, they, forced, themselves, to, believe, that, it, was, right, that, it, should, be, wiped, out, in, exactly, that, manner, and, did, not, alexander, the, great, have, with, him, thais, the, athenian, hetaira, cleitarchus, speaks, of, her, as, having, been, the, cause, for, the, burning, of, the, palace, at, persepolis, after, alexander, s, death, this, same, thais,
