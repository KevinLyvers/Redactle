the, most, important, voyages, in, the, age, of, discovery, and, in, the, history, of, exploration, its, purpose, was, to, cross, the, atlantic, and, pacific, oceans, to, open, a, trade, route, with, the, moluccas, or, spice, islands, in, present, day, indonesia, the, expedition, departed, spain, in, 1519, and, returned, there, in, 1522, led, by, spanish, navigator, juan, sebasti, n, elcano, who, crossed, the, indian, ocean, after, magellan, s, death, in, the, philippines, totaling, 60, 440, km, or, 37, 560, mi, the, nearly, three, year, voyage, achieved, the, first, circumnavigation, of, earth, in, history, it, also, revealed, the, vast, scale, of, the, pacific, ocean, and, proved, that, ships, could, sail, around, the, world, on, a, western, sea, route, the, expedition, accomplished, its, primary, goal, to, find, a, western, route, to, the, spice, islands, the, five, ship, fleet, left, spain, on, 20, september, 1519, with, about, 270, men, after, sailing, across, the, atlantic, ocean, the, fleet, continued, south, along, the, eastern, coast, of, south, america, and, eventually, discovered, the, strait, of, magellan, allowing, the, ships, to, pass, through, to, the, pacific, ocean, which, magellan, himself, named, mar, pacifico, the, fleet, completed, the, first, pacific, crossing, stopped, in, the, philippines, and, eventually, reached, the, moluccas, after, two, years, a, much, depleted, crew, led, by, elcano, finally, returned, to, spain, on, 6, september, 1522, having, sailed, west, across, the, indian, ocean, around, the, cape, of, good, hope, through, waters, controlled, by, the, portuguese, and, north, along, the, west, african, coast, to, finally, arrive, in, spain, the, expedition, endured, many, hardships, including, sabotage, and, mutinies, by, the, mostly, spanish, crew, and, elcano, himself, starvation, scurvy, storms, and, hostile, encounters, with, indigenous, people, only, about, 40, men, and, one, ship, the, victoria, completed, the, circumnavigation, magellan, himself, died, in, battle, in, the, philippines, and, was, succeeded, as, captain, general, by, a, series, of, officers, with, elcano, eventually, leading, the, victoria, s, return, trip, the, expedition, was, funded, mostly, by, king, charles, i, of, spain, with, the, hope, that, it, would, discover, a, profitable, western, route, to, the, spice, islands, as, the, eastern, route, was, controlled, by, portugal, under, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, though, the, expedition, did, find, a, route, it, was, much, longer, and, more, arduous, than, expected, and, was, therefore, not, commercially, useful, nevertheless, the, expedition, is, regarded, as, one, of, the, greatest, achievements, in, seamanship, and, had, a, significant, impact, on, the, european, understanding, of, the, world, christopher, columbus, s, voyages, to, the, west, 1492, 1504, had, the, goal, of, reaching, the, indies, and, establishing, direct, commercial, relations, between, spain, and, the, asian, kingdoms, the, spanish, soon, realized, that, the, lands, of, the, americas, were, not, a, part, of, asia, but, another, continent, the, 1494, treaty, of, tordesillas, reserved, for, portugal, the, eastern, routes, that, went, around, africa, and, vasco, da, gama, and, the, portuguese, arrived, in, india, in, 1498, given, the, economic, importance, of, the, spice, trade, castile, spain, urgently, needed, to, find, a, new, commercial, route, to, asia, after, the, junta, de, toro, conference, of, 1505, the, spanish, crown, commissioned, expeditions, to, discover, a, route, to, the, west, spanish, explorer, vasco, n, ez, de, balboa, reached, the, pacific, ocean, in, 1513, after, crossing, the, isthmus, of, panama, and, juan, d, az, de, sol, s, died, in, r, o, de, la, plata, in, 1516, while, exploring, south, america, in, the, service, of, spain, ferdinand, magellan, was, a, portuguese, sailor, with, previous, military, experience, in, india, malacca, and, morocco, a, friend, and, possible, cousin, with, whom, magellan, sailed, francisco, serr, o, was, part, of, the, first, expedition, to, the, moluccas, leaving, from, malacca, in, 1511, serr, o, reached, the, moluccas, going, on, to, stay, on, the, island, of, ternate, and, take, a, wife, serr, o, sent, letters, to, magellan, from, ternate, extolling, the, beauty, and, richness, of, the, spice, islands, these, letters, likely, motivated, magellan, to, plan, an, expedition, to, the, islands, and, would, later, be, presented, to, spanish, officials, when, magellan, sought, their, sponsorship, historians, speculate, that, beginning, in, 1514, magellan, repeatedly, petitioned, king, manuel, i, of, portugal, to, fund, an, expedition, to, the, moluccas, though, records, are, unclear, it, is, known, that, manuel, repeatedly, denied, magellan, s, requests, for, a, token, increase, to, his, pay, and, that, in, late, 1515, or, early, 1516, manuel, granted, magellan, s, request, to, be, allowed, to, serve, another, master, around, this, time, magellan, met, the, cosmographer, rui, faleiro, another, portuguese, subject, nursing, resentment, towards, manuel, the, two, men, acted, as, partners, in, planning, a, voyage, to, the, moluccas, which, they, would, propose, to, the, king, of, spain, magellan, relocated, to, seville, spain, in, 1517, with, faleiro, following, two, months, later, on, arrival, in, seville, magellan, contacted, juan, de, aranda, factor, of, the, casa, de, contrataci, n, following, the, arrival, of, his, partner, rui, faleiro, and, with, the, support, of, aranda, they, presented, their, project, to, the, king, charles, i, of, spain, future, holy, roman, emperor, charles, v, magellan, s, project, if, successful, would, realise, columbus, plan, of, a, spice, route, by, sailing, west, without, damaging, relations, with, the, portuguese, the, idea, was, in, tune, with, the, times, and, had, already, been, discussed, after, balboa, s, discovery, of, the, pacific, on, 22, march, 1518, the, king, named, magellan, and, faleiro, captains, general, he, also, raised, them, to, the, rank, of, commander, of, the, order, of, santiago, they, reached, an, agreement, with, king, charles, which, granted, them, among, other, things, the, expedition, was, funded, largely, by, the, spanish, crown, which, provided, ships, carrying, supplies, for, two, years, of, travel, though, king, charles, i, was, supposed, to, pay, for, the, fleet, he, was, deeply, in, debt, and, he, turned, to, the, house, of, fugger, through, archbishop, juan, rodr, guez, de, fonseca, head, of, the, casa, de, contrataci, n, the, crown, obtained, the, participation, of, merchant, crist, bal, de, haro, who, provided, a, quarter, of, the,

de, contrataci, n, took, part, in, the, development, of, the, maps, to, be, used, in, the, travel, several, problems, arose, during, the, preparation, of, the, trip, including, lack, of, money, the, king, of, portugal, trying, to, stop, them, magellan, and, other, portuguese, incurring, suspicion, from, the, spanish, and, the, difficult, nature, of, faleiro, the, fleet, consisting, of, five,

transporting, them, the, crew, consisted, of, about, 270, men, mostly, spaniards, spanish, authorities, were, wary, of, magellan, so, that, they, almost, prevented, him, from, sailing, switching, his,

of, st, elmo, s, fire, during, some, of, these, storms, which, was, regarded, as, a, good, omen, by, the, crew, during, these, storms, the, body, of, st, anselme, appeared, to, us, several, times, amongst, others, one, night, that, it, was, very, dark, on, account, of, the, bad, weather, the, said, saint, appeared, in, the, form, of, a, fire, lighted, at, the, summit, of, the, mainmast, and, remained, there, near, two, hours, and, a, half, which, comforted, us, greatly, for, we, were, in, tears, only, expecting, the, hour, of, perishing, and, when, that, holy, light, was, going, away, from, us, it, gave, out, so, great, a, brilliancy, in, the, eyes, of, each, that, we, were, near, a, quarter, of, an, hour, like, people, blinded, and, calling, out, for, mercy, for, without, any, doubt, nobody, hoped, to, escape, from, that, storm, after, two, weeks, of, storms, the, fleet, spent, some, time, stalled, in, calm, equatorial, waters, before, being, carried, west, by, the, south,

could, have, tried, cartagena, for, mutiny, and, sentenced, him, to, death, but, at, the, urging, of, quesada, and, mendoza, he, agreed, to, merely, relieve, cartagena, of, his, command, of, the, san, antonio, and, allow, him, to, move, freely, within, the, confines, of, the, victoria, antonio, de, coca, replaced, cartagena, as, captain, of, the, san, antonio, some, details, about, the, sodomy,

verzin, in, his, diary, after, the, italian, term, for, brazilwood, had, been, known, to, the, spanish, and, portuguese, since, about, 1500, and, in, the, intervening, decades, european, powers, particularly, portugal, had, been, sending, ships, to, brazil, to, collect, valuable, brazilwood, the, armada, carried, a, map, of, the, brazilian, coastline, the, livro, da, marinharia, the, book, of, the, sea, and, also, had, a, crew, member, the, concepci, n, s, pilot, jo, o, lopes, carvalho, who, had, previously, visited, rio, de, janeiro, carvalho, was, enlisted, to, lead, the, fleet, s, navigation, down, the, brazilian, coastline, to, rio, aboard, the, trinidad, and, also, helped, communicate, with, the, locals, as, he, had, some, rudimentary, knowledge, of, their, guarani, language, on, 13, december, the, fleet, reached, rio, de, janeiro, though, nominally, portuguese, territory, they, maintained, no, permanent, settlement, there, at, the, time, seeing, no, portuguese, ships, in, the, harbour, magellan, knew, it, would, be, safe, to, stop, pigafetta, wrote, of, a, coincidence, of, weather, that, caused, the, armada, to, be, warmly, received, by, the, indigenous, people, it, is, to, be, known, that, it, happened, that, it, had, not, rained, for, two, months, before, we, came, there, and, the, day, that, we, arrived, it, began, to, rain, on, which, account, the, people, of, the, said, place, said, that, we, came, from, heaven, and, had, brought, the, rain, with, us, which, was, great, simplicity, and, these, people, were, easily, converted, to, the, christian, faith, the, fleet, spent, 13, days, in, rio, during, which, they, repaired, their, ships, stocked, up, on, water, and, food, such, as, yam, cassava, and, pineapple, and, interacted, with, the, locals, the, expedition, had, brought, with, them, a, great, quantity, of, trinkets, intended, for, trade, such, as, mirrors, combs, knives, and, bells, the, locals, readily, exchanged, food, and, local, goods, such, as, parrot, feathers, for, such, items, the, crew, also, found, they, could, purchase, sexual, favours, from, the, local, women, historian, ian, cameron, described, the, crew, s, time, in, rio, as, a, saturnalia, of, feasting, and, lovemaking, on, 27, december, the, fleet, left, rio, de, janeiro, pigafetta, wrote, that, the, natives, were, disappointed, to, see, them, leave, and, that, some, followed, them, in, canoes, trying, to, entice, them, to, stay, just, before, sailing, magellan, replaced, antonio, de, coca, the, fleet, accountant, who, had, briefly, assumed, command, of, san, antonio, from, cartagena, with, the, inexperienced, lvaro, de, mezquita, who, originally, had, shipped, out, aboard, the, flagship, from, seville, as, a, mere, supernumerary, the, fleet, sailed, south, along, the, south, american, coast, hoping, to, reach, el, paso, the, fabled, strait, that, would, allow, them, passage, past, south, america, to, the, spice, islands, on, 11, january, a, headland, marked, by, three, hills, was, sighted, which, the, crew, believed, to, be, cape, santa, maria, around, the, headland, they, found, a, wide, body, of, water, that, extended, as, far, as, the, eye, could, see, in, a, west, by, southwest, direction, magellan, believed, he, had, found, el, paso, though, in, fact, he, had, reached, the, r, o, de, la, plata, magellan, directed, the, santiago, commanded, by, juan, serrano, to, probe, the, strait, and, led, the, other, ships, south, hoping, to, find, terra, australis, the, southern, continent, which, was, then, widely, supposed, to, exist, south, of, south, america, they, failed, to, find, the, southern, continent, and, when, they, regrouped, with, the, santiago, a, few, days, later, serrano, reported, that, the, hoped, for, strait, was, in, fact, the, mouth, of, a, river, incredulous, magellan, led, the, fleet, through, the, western, waters, again, taking, frequent, soundings, serrano, s, claim, was, confirmed, when, the, men, eventually, found, themselves, in, fresh, water, on, 3, february, the, fleet, continued, south, along, the, south, american, coast, magellan, believed, they, would, find, a, strait, or, the, southern, terminus, of, the, continent, within, a, short, distance, in, fact, the, fleet, would, sail, south, for, another, eight, weeks, without, finding, passage, before, stopping, to, overwinter, at, st, julian, not, wanting, to, miss, the, strait, the, fleet, sailed, as, close, to, the, coast, as, feasible, heightening, the, danger, of, running, aground, on, shoals, the, ships, sailed, only, during, the, day, with, lookouts, carefully, watching, the, coast, for, signs, of, a, passage, in, addition, to, the, hazards, of, shallow, waters, the, fleet, encountered, squalls, storms, and, dropping, temperatures, as, they, continued, south, and, winter, set, in, by, the, third, week, of, march, weather, conditions, had, become, so, desperate, that, magellan, decided, they, should, find, a, safe, harbour, in, which, to, wait, out, the, winter, before, resuming, the, search, for, a, passage, in, spring, on, 31, march, 1520, a, break, in, the, coast, was, spotted, there, the, fleet, found, a, natural, harbour, which, they, called, port, st, julian, the, men, remained, at, st, julian, for, five, months, before, resuming, their, search, for, the, strait, within, a, day, of, landing, at, st, julian, there, was, another, mutiny, attempt, like, the, one, during, the, atlantic, crossing, it, was, led, by, juan, de, cartagena, former, captain, of, the, san, antonio, aided, by, gaspar, de, quesada, and, luis, mendoza, captains, of, the, concepci, n, and, victoria, respectively, as, before, the, castilian, captains, questioned, magellan, s, leadership, and, accused, him, of, recklessly, endangering, the, fleet, s, crew, and, ships, the, mutiny, at, st, julian, was, more, calculated, than, the, fracas, that, had, followed, the, sodomy, trial, during, the, atlantic, crossing, around, midnight, of, easter, sunday, 1, april, cartagena, and, quesada, covertly, led, thirty, armed, men, their, faces, covered, with, charcoal, aboard, the, san, antonio, where, they, ambushed, lvaro, de, mezquita, the, recently, named, captain, of, the, ship, mezquita, was, magellan, s, cousin, and, sympathetic, to, the, captain, general, juan, de, elorriaga, the, ship, s, master, resisted, the, mutineers, and, attempted, to, alert, the, other, ships, for, this, reason, quesada, stabbed, him, repeatedly, he, would, die, from, his, wounds, months, later, with, the, san, antonio, subdued, the, mutineers, controlled, three, of, the, fleet, s, five, ships, only, the, santiago, commanded, by, juan, serrano, remained, loyal, to, magellan, along, with, the, flag, ship, the, trinidad, which, magellan, commanded, the, mutineers, aimed, the, san, antonio, s, cannon, at, the, trinidad, but, made, no, further, overtures, during, the, night, the, following, morning, 2, april, while, the, mutineers, attempted, to, consolidate, their, forces, aboard, the, san, antonio, and, the, victoria, a, longboat, of, sailors, drifted, off, course, into, the, vicinity, of, the, trinidad, the, men, were, brought, aboard, and, persuaded, to, divulge, the, details, of, the, mutineers, plans, to, magellan, magellan, subsequently, launched, a, counteroffensive, against, the, mutineers, aboard, the, victoria, he, had, some, marines, from, the, trinidad, switch, clothing, with, the, stray, sailors, and, approach, the, victoria, in, their, longboat, his, alguacil, gonzalo, de, espinosa, also, approached, the, victoria, in, a, skiff, and, announced, that, he, had, a, message, for, the, captain, luis, mendoza, espinosa, was, allowed, aboard, and, into, the, captain, s, chambers, based, on, his, claim, that, he, had, a, confidential, letter, there, espinosa, stabbed, mendoza, in, the, throat, with, his, poignard, killing, him, instantly, at, the, same, time, the, disguised, marines, came, aboard, the, victoria, to, support, the, alguacil, with, the, victoria, lost, and, mendoza, dead, the, remaining, mutineers, realised, they, were, outmanoeuvred, quesada, attempted, to, flee, but, was, prevented, from, doing, so, sailors, loyal, to, magellan, had, cut, the, concepci, n, s, cables, causing, it, to, drift, toward, the, trinidad, and, quesada, was, captured, cartagena, conceded, and, begged, magellan, for, mercy, the, trial, of, the, mutineers, was, headed, by, magellan, s, cousin, lvaro, de, mezquita, and, lasted, five, days, on, 7, april,

quartered, and, displayed, on, gibbets, for, the, following, three, months, san, mart, n, suspected, of, involvement, in, the, conspiracy, was, tortured, by, strappado, but, afterwards, was, allowed, to, continue, his, service, as, cosmographer, cartagena, along, with, a, priest, pedro, sanchez, de, reina, were, sentenced, to, be, marooned, on, 11, august, two, weeks, before, the, fleet, left, st, julian, the, two, were, taken, to, a, small, nearby, island, and, left, to, die, more, than, forty, other, conspirators, including, juan, sebasti, n, elcano, were, put, in, chains, for, much, of, the, winter, and, made, to, perform, the, hard, work, of, careening, the, ships, repairing, their, structure, and, scrubbing, the, bilge, in, late, april, magellan, dispatched, the, santiago, captained, by, juan, serrano, from, st, julian, to, scout, to, the, south, for, a, strait, on, 3, may, they, reached, the, estuary, of, a, river, which, serrano, named, santa, cruz, river, the, estuary, provided, shelter, and, was, well, situated, with, natural, resources, including, fish, penguins, and, wood, after, more, than, a, week, exploring, santa, cruz, serrano, set, out, to, return, to, st, julian, on, 22, may, but, was, caught, in, a, sudden, storm, while, leaving, the, harbour, the, santiago, was, tossed, about, by, strong, winds, and, currents, before, running, aground, on, a, sandbar, all, or, nearly, all, of, the, crew, were, able, to, clamber, ashore, before, the, ship, capsized, two, men, volunteered, to, set, off, on, foot, for, st, julian, to, get, help, after, 11, days, of, hard, trekking, the, men, arrived, at, st, julian, exhausted, and, emaciated, magellan, sent, a, rescue, party, of, 24, men, over, land, to, santa, cruz, the, other, 35, survivors, from, the, santiago, remained, at, santa, cruz, for, two, weeks, they, were, unable, to, retrieve, any, supplies, from, the, wreck, of, the, santiago, but, managed, to, build, huts, and, fire, and, subsist, on, a, diet, of, shellfish, and, local, vegetation, the, rescue, party, found, them, all, alive, but, exhausted, and, they, returned, to, st, julian, safely, after, learning, of, the, favourable, conditions, that, serrano, found, at, santa, cruz, magellan, decided, to, move, the, fleet, there, for, the, rest, of, the, austral, winter, after, almost, five, months, at, st, julian, the, fleet, left, for, santa, cruz, around, 24, august, they, spent, six, weeks, at, santa, cruz, before, resuming, their, search, for, the, strait, on, 18, october, the, fleet, left, santa, cruz, heading, south, resuming, their, search, for, a, passage, soon, after, on, 21, october, 1520, they, spotted, a, headland, at, 52, s, latitude, which, they, named, cape, virgenes, past, the, cape, they, found, a, large, bay, while, they, were, exploring, the, bay, a, storm, erupted, the, trinidad, and, victoria, made, it, out, to, open, seas, but, the, concepci, n, and, san, antonio, were, driven, deeper, into, the, bay, toward, a, promontory, three, days, later, the, fleet, was, reunited, and, the, concepci, n, and, san, antonio, reported, that, the, storm, drew, them, through, a, narrow, passage, not, visible, from, sea, which, continued, for, some, distance, hoping, they, had, finally, found, their, sought, after, strait, the, fleet, retraced, the, path, taken, by, the, concepci, n, and, san, antonio, unlike, at, r, o, de, la, plata, earlier, the, water, did, not, lose, its, salinity, as, they, progressed, and, soundings, indicated, that, the, waters, were, consistently, deep, this, was, the, passage, they, sought, which, would, come, to, be, known, as, the, strait, of, magellan, at, the, time, magellan, referred, to, it, as, the, estrecho, canal, de, todos, los, santos, all, saints, channel, because, the, fleet, travelled, through, it, on, 1, november, or, all, saints, day, on, 28, october, the, fleet, reached, an, island, in, the, strait, likely, isabel, island, or, dawson, island, which, could, be, passed, in, one, of, two, directions, magellan, directed, the, fleet, to, split, up, to, explore, the, respective, paths, they, were, meant, to, regroup, within, a, few, days, but, the, san, antonio, would, never, rejoin, the, fleet, while, the, rest, of, the, fleet, waited, for, the, return, of, the, san, antonio, gonzalo, de, espinosa, led, a, small, ship, to, explore, the, further, reaches, of, the, strait, after, three, days, of, sailing, they, reached, the, end, of, the, strait, and, the, mouth, of, the, pacific, ocean, after, another, three, days, espinosa, returned, pigafetta, writes, that, on, hearing, the, news, of, espinosa, s, discovery, magellan, wept, tears, of, joy, the, fleet, s, remaining, three, ships, completed, the, journey, to, the, pacific, by, 28, november, after, weeks, of, fruitlessly, searching, for, the, san, antonio, magellan, named, the, waters, the, mar, pacifico, or, pacific, ocean, because, of, how, still, and, peaceful, the, sea, was, especially, compared, with, the, straits, the, san, antonio, failed, to, rejoin, the, rest, of, magellan, s, fleet, in, the, strait, at, some, point, they, reversed, course, and, sailed, back, to, spain, the, ship, s, officers, later, testified, that, they, had, arrived, early, at, the, appointed, rendezvous, location, but, it, s, not, clear, whether, this, is, true, the, captain, of, the, san, antonio, at, the, time, lvaro, de, mezquita, was, magellan, s, cousin, and, loyal, to, the, captain, general, he, directed, attempts, to, rejoin, the, fleet, firing, cannons, and, setting, off, smoke, signals, at, some, point, he, was, overpowered, in, yet, another, mutiny, attempt, this, one, successful, he, was, stabbed, by, the, pilot, of, the, san, antonio, est, v, o, gomes, and, put, in, chains, for, the, remainder, of, the, journey, gomes, was, known, to, have, feelings, of, animosity, towards, magellan, as, documented, by, pigafetta, who, wrote, that, gomes, hated, the, captain, general, exceedingly, because, he, had, hoped, to, have, his, own, expedition, to, the, moluccas, funded, instead, of, magellan, s, and, shortly, before, the, fleet, was, separated, had, argued, with, him, about, their, next, course, of, action, while, magellan, and, the, other, officers, agreed, to, continue, west, to, the, moluccas, thinking, that, their, 2, 3, months, of, rations, would, be, sufficient, for, the, journey, gomes, argued, that, they, should, return, to, spain, the, way, they, had, come, to, muster, more, supplies, for, another, journey, through, the, strait, the, san, antonio, reached, seville, approximately, six, months, later, on, 6, or, 8, may, 1521, with, 55, survivors, there, ensued, a, trial, of, the, ship, s, men, which, lasted, six, months, with, mezquita, being, the, only, one, loyal, to, magellan, the, majority, of, testimony, produced, a, villainous, and, distorted, picture, of, magellan, s, actions, in, particular, in, justifying, the, mutiny, at, st, julian, the, men, claimed, that, magellan, had, tortured, spanish, seamen, during, the, return, journey, across, the, atlantic, mezquita, was, tortured, into, signing, a, statement, to, this, effect, and, claimed, that, they, were, merely, trying, to, make, magellan, follow, the, king, s, orders, ultimately, none, of, the, mutineers, faced, charges, in, spain, magellan, s, reputation, suffered, as, a, result, as, did, his, friends, and, family, mezquita, was, kept, in, jail, for, a, year, following, the, trial, and, magellan, s, wife, beatriz, had, her, financial, resources, cut, off, and, was, placed, under, house, arrest, along, with, their, son, magellan, along, with, contemporary, geographers, had, no, conception, of, the, vastness, of, the, pacific, ocean, he, imagined, that, south, america, was, separated, from, the, spice, islands, by, a, small, sea, which, he, expected, to, cross, in, as, little, as, three, or, four, days, in, fact, they, spent, three, months, and, twenty, days, at, sea, before, reaching, guam, and, then, the, philippines, the, fleet, entered, the, pacific, from, the, strait, of, magellan, on, 28, november, 1520, and, initially, sailed, north, following, the, coast, of, chile, by, mid, december, they, altered, their, course, to, west, north, west, they, were, unfortunate, in, that, had, their, course, differed, slightly, they, might, have, encountered, a, number, of, pacific, islands, which, would, have, offered, fresh, food, and, water, such, as, the, marshall, islands, the, society, islands, the, solomon, islands, or, the, marquesas, islands, as, it, was, they, encountered, only, two, small, uninhabited, islands, during, the, crossing, at, which, they, were, unable, to, land, the, reason, why, they, named, them, islas, infortunadas, the, first, sighted, 24, january, they, named, san, pablo, saint, paul, in, spanish, likely, puka, puka, the, second, sighted, 21, february, they, named, tiburones, sharks, in, spanish, likely, caroline, island, or, flint, island, they, crossed, the, equator, on, 13, february, not, expecting, such, a, long, journey, the, ships, were, not, stocked, with, adequate, food, and, water, and, much, of, the, seal, meat, they, had, stocked, putrefied, in, the, equatorial, heat, pigafetta, described, the, desperate, conditions, in, his, journal, we, only, ate, old, biscuit, reduced, to, powder, and, full, of, grubs, and, stinking, from, the, dirt, which, the, rats, had, made, on, it, when, eating, the, good, biscuit, and, we, drank, water, that, was, yellow, and, stinking, we, also, ate, the, ox, hides, which, were, under, the, main, yard, so, that, the, yard, should, not, break, the, rigging, they, were, very, hard, on, account, of, the, sun, rain, and, wind, and, we, left, them, for, four, or, five, days, in, the, sea, and, then, we, put, them, a, little, on, the, embers, and, so, ate, them, also, the, sawdust, of, wood, and, rats, which, cost, half, a, crown, each, moreover, enough, of, them, were, not, to, be, got, moreover, most, of, the, men, suffered, from, symptoms, of, scurvy, whose, cause, was, not, understood, at, the, time, pigafetta, reported, that, of, the, 166, men, who, embarked, on, the, pacific, crossing, 19, died, and, twenty, five, or, thirty, fell, ill, of, diverse, sicknesses, magellan, pigafetta, and, other, officers, were, not, afflicted, with, scorbutic, symptoms, which, may, have, been, because, they, ate, preserved, quince, which, unbeknownst, to, them, contained, the, vitamin, c, necessary, to, protect, against, scurvy, on, 6, march, 1521, the, fleet, reached, the, mariana, islands, the, first, land, they, spotted, was, likely, the, island, of, rota, but, the, ships, were, unable, to, land, there, instead, they, dropped, anchor, thirty, hours, later, on, guam, where, they, were, met, by, native, chamorro, people, in, proas, a, type, of, outrigger, canoe, then, unknown, to, europeans, dozens, of, chamorros, came, aboard, and, began, taking, items, from, the, ship, including, rigging, knives, and, any, items, made, of, iron, at, some, point, there, was, a, physical, confrontation, between, the, crew, and, the, natives, and, at, least, one, chamorro, was, killed, the, remaining, natives, fled, with, the, goods, they, had, obtained, also, taking, magellan, s, bergantina, the, ship, s, boat, kept, on, the, trinidad, as, they, retreated, for, this, act, magellan, called, the, island, isla, de, los, ladrones, island, of, thieves, the, next, day, magellan, retaliated, sending, a, raiding, party, ashore, which, looted, and, burned, forty, or, fifty, chamorro, houses, and, killed, seven, men, they, recovered, the, bergantina, and, left, guam, the, next, day, 9, march, continuing, westward, the, fleet, reached, the, philippines, on, 16, march, and, remained, there, until, 1, may, the, expedition, represented, the, first, documented, european, contact, with, the, philippines, although, the, stated, goals, of, magellan, s, expedition, were, to, find, a, passage, through, south, america, to, the, moluccas, and, return, to, spain, laden, with, spices, at, this, point, in, the, journey, magellan, seemed, to, acquire, a, zeal, for, converting, the, local, tribes, to, christianity, in, doing, so, magellan, eventually, became, embroiled, in, a, local, political, dispute, and, died, in, the, philippines, along, with, dozens, of, other, officers, and, crew, on, 16, march, a, week, after, leaving, guam, the, fleet, first, sighted, the, island, of, samar, then, landed, on, the, island, of, homonhon, which, was, then, uninhabited, they, encountered, friendly, locals, from, the, nearby, island, of, suluan, and, traded, supplies, with, them, they, spent, nearly, two, weeks, on, homonhon, resting, and, gathering, fresh, food, and, water, before, leaving, on, 27, march, on, the, morning, of, 28, march, they, neared, the, island, of, limasawa, and, encountered, some, natives, in, canoes, who, then, alerted, balangay, warships, of, two, local, rulers, from, mindanao, who, were, on, a, hunting, expedition, in, limasawa, for, the, first, time, on, the, journey, magellan, s, slave, enrique, of, malacca, found, that, he, was, able, to, communicate, with, the, natives, in, malay, an, indication, that, they, had, indeed, completed, a, circumnavigation, and, were, approaching, familiar, lands, they, exchanged, gifts, with, the, natives, receiving, porcelain, jars, painted, with, chinese, designs, and, later, that, day, magellan, was, introduced, to, their, leaders, rajah, kolambu, and, rajah, siawi, afterwards, magellan, would, become, a, blood, brother, to, kolambu, undergoing, the, local, blood, compact, ritual, with, him, magellan, and, his, men, noted, that, the, rajahs, had, golden, body, ornaments, and, served, food, on, golden, plates, they, were, told, by, the, rajahs, that, gold, was, plentiful, in, their, homelands, in, butuan, and, calagan, surigao, and, found, that, the, locals, were, eager, to, trade, it, for, iron, at, par, while, at, limasawa, magellan, gave, some, of, the, natives, a, demonstration, of, spanish, armour, weapons, and, artillery, by, which, they, were, apparently, impressed, on, sunday, 31, march, easter, day, magellan, and, fifty, of, his, men, came, ashore, to, limasawa, to, participate, in, the, first, catholic, mass, in, the, philippines, given, by, the, armada, s, chaplain, kolambu, his, brother, who, was, also, a, local, leader, and, other, islanders, joined, in, the, ceremony, and, expressed, an, interest, in, their, religion, following, mass, magellan, s, men, raised, a, cross, on, the, highest, hill, on, the, island, and, formally, declared, the, island, and, the, entire, archipelago, of, the, philippines, which, he, called, the, islands, of, st, lazarus, as, a, possession, of, spain, on, 2, april, magellan, held, a, conference, to, decide, the, fleet, s, next, course, of, action, his, officers, urged, him, to, head, south, west, for, the, mollucas, but, instead, he, decided, to, press, further, into, the, philippines, on, 3, april, the, fleet, sailed, north, west, from, limasawa, towards, the, island, of, cebu, which, magellan, learned, of, from, kolambu, the, fleet, was, guided, to, cebu, by, some, of, kolambu, s, men, they, sighted, cebu, 6, april, and, made, landfall, the, next, day, cebu, had, regular, contact, with, chinese, and, arab, traders, and, normally, required, that, visitors, pay, tribute, in, order, to, trade, magellan, convinced, the, island, s, leader, rajah, humabon, to, waive, this, requirement, as, he, had, in, limasawa, magellan, gave, a, demonstration, of, the, fleet, s, arms, in, order, to, impress, the, locals, again, he, also, preached, christianity, to, the, natives, and, on, 14, april, humabon, and, his, family, were, baptised, and, given, an, image, of, the, holy, child, later, known, as, santo, ni, o, de, cebu, in, the, coming, days, other, local, chieftains, were, baptised, and, in, total, 2, 200, locals, from, cebu, and, other, nearby, islands, were, converted, when, magellan, learned, that, a, group, on, the, island, of, mactan, led, by, lapu, lapu, resisted, christian, conversion, he, ordered, his, men, to, burn, their, homes, when, they, continued, to, resist, magellan, informed, his, council, on, 26, april, that, he, would, bring, an, armed, contingent, to, mactan, and, make, them, submit, under, threat, of, force, magellan, mustered, a, force, of, 60, armed, men, from, his, crew, to, oppose, lapu, lapu, s, forces, some, cebuano, men, followed, magellan, to, mactan, but, were, instructed, by, magellan, not, to, join, the, fight, but, merely, to, watch, he, first, sent, an, envoy, to, lapu, lapu, offering, him, a, last, chance, to, accept, the, king, of, spain, as, their, ruler, and, avoid, bloodshed, lapu, lapu, refused, magellan, took, 49, men, to, the, shore, while, 11, remained, to, guard, the, boats, though, they, had, the, benefit, of, relatively, advanced, armour, and, weaponry, magellan, s, forces, were, greatly, outnumbered, pigafetta, who, was, present, on, the, battlefield, estimated, the, enemy, s, number, at, 1, 500, magellan, s, forces, were, driven, back, and, decisively, defeated, magellan, died, in, battle, along, with, several, comrades, including, crist, v, o, rebelo, magellan, s, illegitimate, son, following, magellan, s, death, the, remaining, men, held, an, election, to, select, a, new, leader, for, the, expedition, they, selected, two, co, commanders, duarte, barbosa, magellan, s, brother, in, law, and, juan, serrano, magellan, s, will, called, for, the, liberation, of, his, slave, enrique, but, barbosa, and, serrano, demanded, that, he, continue, his, duties, as, an, interpreter, for, them, and, follow, their, orders, enrique, had, some, secret, communication, with, humabon, which, caused, him, to, betray, the, spaniards, on, 1, may, humabon, invited, the, men, ashore, for, a, great, feast, it, was, attended, by, around, thirty, men, mostly, officers, including, serrano, and, barbosa, towards, the, end, of, the, meal, armed, cebuanos, entered, the, hall, and, murdered, the, europeans, twenty, seven, men, were, killed, juan, serrano, one, of, the, newly, elected, co, commanders, was, left, alive, and, brought, to, the, shore, facing, the, spanish, ships, serrano, begged, the, men, on, board, to, pay, a, ransom, to, the, cebuanos, the, spanish, ships, left, port, and, serrano, was, presumably, killed, in, his, account, pigafetta, speculates, that, jo, o, carvalho, who, became, first, in, command, in, the, absence, of, barbosa, and, serrano, abandoned, serrano, his, one, time, friend, so, that, he, could, remain, in, command, of, the, fleet, with, just, 115, surviving, men, out, of, the, 277, who, had, sailed, from, seville, it, was, decided, the, fleet, did, not, have, enough, men, to, continue, operating, three, ships, on, 2, may, the, concepci, n, was, emptied, and, set, on, fire, with, carvalho, as, the, new, captain, general, the, remaining, two, ships, the, trinidad, and, victoria, spent, the, next, six, months, meandering, through, southeast, asia, in, search, of, the, moluccas, on, the, way, they, stopped, at, several, islands, including, palawan, and, brunei, during, this, time, they, engaged, in, acts, of, piracy, including, robbing, a, junk, bound, for, china, from, the, moluccas, on, 21, september, carvalho, was, made, to, step, down, as, captain, general, he, was, replaced, by, martin, mendez, with, gonzalo, de, espinosa, and, juan, sebasti, n, elcano, as, captains, of, the, trinidad, and, victoria, respectively, aganduru, moriz, account, of, the, expedition, describes, how, elcano, s, crew, was, attacked, somewhere, off, the, southeastern, tip, of, borneo, by, a, bruneian, fleet, commanded, by, one, of, the, luzones, historians, such, as, william, henry, scott, and, luis, camara, dery, assert, that, this, commander, of, the, bruneian, fleet, was, actually, the, young, prince, ache, of, maynila, manila, a, grandson, of, the, bruneian, sultan, who, would, later, become, maynila, s, rajah, matanda, elcano, however, was, able, to, defeat, and, capture, ache, according, to, scott, ache, was, eventually, released, after, a, ransom, was, paid, nevertheless, ache, left, a, spanish, speaking, moor, in, elcano, s, crew, to, assist, the, ship, on, the, way, back, to, spain, a, moor, who, understood, something, of, our, castilian, language, who, was, called, pazeculan, this, knowledge, of, the, spanish, language, was, scattered, across, the, indian, ocean, and, even, into, southeast, asia, after, the, castilian, conquest, of, the, emirate, of, granada, forced, the, spanish, speaking, granadan, muslims, to, migrate, across, the, muslim, world, even, as, far, as, islamic, manila, the, ships, finally, reached, the, moluccas, on, 8, november, when, they, reached, the, island, of, tidore, they, were, greeted, by, the, island, s, leader, al, mansur, known, to, the, officers, by, the, spanish, name, almanzor, almanzor, was, a, friendly, host, to, the, men, and, readily, claimed, loyalty, to, the, king, of, spain, a, trading, post, was, established, in, tidore, and, the, men, set, about, purchasing, massive, quantities, of, cloves, in, exchange, for, goods, such, as, cloth, knives, and, glassware, around, 15, december, the, ships, attempted, to, set, sail, from, tidore, laden, with, cloves, but, the, trinidad, which, had, fallen, into, disrepair, was, found, to, be, taking, on, water, the, departure, was, postponed, while, the, men, aided, by, the, locals, attempted, to, find, and, repair, the, leak, when, these, attempts, were, unsuccessful, it, was, decided, that, the, victoria, would, leave, for, spain, via, a, western, route, and, that, the, trinidad, would, remain, behind, for, some, time, to, be, refitted, before, heading, back, to, spain, by, an, eastern, route, involving, an, overland, passage, across, the, american, continent, in, the, area, of, the, isthmus, of, panama, several, weeks, later, trinidad, departed, and, attempted, to, return, to, spain, via, the, pacific, route, this, attempt, failed, trinidad, was, captured, by, the, portuguese, and, was, eventually, wrecked, in, a, storm, while, at, anchor, under, portuguese, control, the, victoria, set, sail, via, the, indian, ocean, route, home, on, 21, december, 1521, commanded, by, juan, sebasti, n, elcano, by, 6, may, 1522, the, victoria, rounded, the, cape, of, good, hope, with, only, rice, for, rations, twenty, crewmen, died, of, starvation, by, 9, july, 1522, when, elcano, put, into, portuguese, cape, verde, for, provisions, the, crew, was, surprised, to, learn, that, the, date, was, actually, 10, july, 1522, a, day, after, their, own, meticulous, records, indicated, they, had, no, trouble, making, purchases, at, first, using, the, cover, story, that, they, were, returning, to, spain, from, the, americas, however, the, portuguese, detained, 13, crew, members, after, discovering, that, victoria, was, carrying, spices, from, the, east, indies, the, victoria, managed, to, escape, with, its, cargo, of, 26, tons, of, spices, cloves, and, cinnamon, on, 6, september, 1522, elcano, and, the, remaining, crew, of, magellan, s, voyage, arrived, in, sanl, car, de, barrameda, in, spain, aboard, victoria, almost, exactly, three, years, after, they, departed, they, then, sailed, upriver, to, seville, and, from, there, overland, to, valladolid, where, they, appeared, before, the, emperor, when, victoria, the, one, surviving, ship, and, the, smallest, carrack, in, the, fleet, returned, to, the, harbour, of, departure, after, completing, the, first, circumnavigation, of, the, earth, only, 18, men, out, of, the, original, 270, men, were, on, board, in, addition, to,
