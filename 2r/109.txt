the, zapotec, civilization, be, ena, a, zapotec, the, people, c, 700, bc, 1521, ad, is, an, indigenous, pre, columbian, civilization, that, flourished, in, the, valley, of, oaxaca, in, mesoamerica, archaeological, evidence, shows, that, their, culture, originated, at, least, 2, 500, years, ago, the, zapotec, archaeological, site, at, the, ancient, city, of, monte, alb, n, has, monumental, buildings, ball, courts, magnificent, tombs, and, grave, goods, including, finely, worked, gold, jewelry, monte, alb, n, was, one, of, the, first, major, cities, in, mesoamerica, it, was, the, center, of, a, zapotec, state, that, dominated, much, of, the, territory, which, today, is, known, as, the, mexican, state, of, oaxaca, zapotec, civilization, originated, in, the, y, shaped, central, valleys, of, oaxaca, in, the, late, 6th, century, bc, the, three, valleys, were, divided, among, three, differently, sized, societies, separated, by, 80, square, kilometres, 31, sq, mi, no, man, s, land, in, the, middle, the, city, of, oaxaca, much, later, developed, in, that, area, archaeological, evidence, such, as, burned, temples, and, sacrificed, war, captives, suggests, that, the, three, societies, competed, against, each, other, at, the, end, of, the, rosario, phase, 700, 500, bc, the, valley, s, largest, settlement, san, jos, mogote, and, a, nearby, settlement, in, the, etla, valley, lost, most, of, their, population, during, the, same, period, a, new, large, settlement, developed, in, the, no, man, s, land, on, top, of, a, mountain, overlooking, the, three, valleys, it, was, later, called, monte, alb, n, early, monte, alb, n, pottery, is, similar, to, pottery, from, san, jos, mogote, which, suggests, that, the, newer, city, was, populated, by, people, who, had, left, san, jos, mogote, although, there, is, no, direct, evidence, in, the, early, phases, of, monte, alb, n, s, history, walls, and, fortifications, around, the, site, during, the, archaeological, phase, monte, alban, 2, ca, 100, bc, 200, ad, suggest, that, the, city, was, constructed, in, response, to, a, military, threat, american, archaeologists, joyce, marcus, and, kent, v, flannery, liken, this, process, to, what, happened, in, ancient, greece, synoikism, a, centralization, of, smaller, dispersed, populations, congregated, in, a, central, city, to, meet, an, external, threat, the, zapotec, state, formed, at, monte, alb, n, began, to, expand, during, the, late, monte, alban, 1, phase, 400, 100, bc, and, throughout, the, monte, alban, 2, phase, 100, bc, ad, 200, during, monte, alban, 1c, roughly, 200, bc, to, monte, alban, 2, 200, bc, ad, 100, zapotec, rulers, seized, control, of, the, provinces, outside, the, valley, of, oaxaca, because, none, of, the, surrounding, provinces, could, compete, with, them, politically, and, militarily, by, 200, ad, the, zapotec, had, extended, their, influence, from, quiotepec, in, the, north, to, ocelotepec, and, chiltepec, in, the, south, monte, alb, n, had, become, the, largest, city, in, what, are, today, the, southern, mexican, highlands, and, retained, this, status, until, approximately, 700, ad, the, expansion, of, the, zapotec, empire, peaked, during, the, monte, alban, 2, phase, the, zapotec, conquered, or, colonized, settlements, far, beyond, the, valley, of, oaxaca, most, notably, their, influence, is, visible, in, the, sudden, change, in, style, of, ceramics, made, in, regions, outside, the, valley, these, regions, unique, styles, were, suddenly, replaced, with, zapotec, style, pottery, indicating, their, integration, into, the, zapotec, empire, archaeologist, alfonso, caso, one, of, the, first, to, conduct, excavations, in, monte, alb, n, in, the, 1930s, argued, that, a, building, on, the, main, plaza, of, monte, alb, n, is, further, evidence, for, the, dramatic, expansion, of, the, zapotec, state, what, today, is, called, building, j, is, shaped, like, an, arrowhead, unlike, other, monumental, buildings, it, displays, more, than, 40, carved, stones, with, hieroglyphic, writing, archaeologists, interpreted, the, glyphs, to, represent, the, provinces, controlled, by, the, zapotec, each, glyph, group, also, depicts, a, head, with, an, elaborate, head, dress, carved, into, the, slabs, these, are, assumed, to, represent, the, rulers, of, the, provinces, heads, turned, upside, down, are, believed, to, represent, the, rulers, killed, and, whose, provinces, were, taken, by, force, while, the, upright, ones, may, represent, those, who, did, not, resist, annexation, and, had, their, lives, spared, for, this, reason, building, j, is, also, referred, to, by, archeologists, as, the, conquest, slab, marcus, and, flannery, write, about, the, subsequent, dramatic, expansion, of, the, monte, alb, n, state, noting, when, there, is, a, great, disparity, in, populations, between, the, core, of, a, state, and, its, periphery, it, may, only, be, necessary, for, the, former, to, send, colonists, to, the, latter, small, polities, seeing, that, resistance, would, be, futile, may, accept, a, face, saving, offer, larger, polities, unwilling, to, lose, their, autonomy, may, have, to, be, subdued, militarily, during, the, expansion, of, monte, alban, 2, state, we, think, we, see, both, colonization, and, conquest, the, last, battle, between, the, aztecs, and, the, zapotecs, occurred, between, 1497, 1502, under, the, aztec, ruler, ahuizotl, at, the, time, of, spanish, conquest, of, the, aztec, empire, when, news, arrived, that, the, aztecs, were, defeated, by, the, spaniards, king, cosijoeza, ordered, his, people, not, to, confront, the, spaniards, so, they, would, avoid, the, same, fate, they, were, defeated, by, the, spaniards, only, after, several, campaigns, between, 1522, 1527, however, uprisings, against, colonial, authorities, occurred, in, 1550, 1560, and, 1715, the, name, zapotec, is, an, exonym, they, were, referred, to, by, nahuatl, speakers, as, tzapot, cah, singular, tzapot, catl, which, means, inhabitants, of, the, place, of, sapote, the, zapotec, referred, to, themselves, by, some, variant, of, the, term, be, ena, a, which, means, the, cloud, people, the, zapotec, languages, belong, to, a, language, family, called, oto, manguean, an, ancient, family, of, mesoamerican, languages, it, is, estimated, that, today, s, oto, manguean, languages, branched, off, from, a, common, root, at, around, 1500, bc, the, manguean, languages, probably, split, off, first, followed, by, the, oto, pamean, branch, while, the, divergence, of, mixtecan, and, zapotecan, languages, happened, later, still, the, zapotecan, group, includes, the, zapotec, languages, and, the, closely, related, chatino, zapotec, languages, are, spoken, in, parts, of, the, northern, sierra, the, central, valleys, as, well, as, in, parts, of, the, southern, sierra, in, the, isthmus, of, tehuantepec, and, along, parts, of, the, pacific, coast, due, to, decades, of, out, migration, zapotec, is, also, spoken, in, parts, of, mexico, city, and, los, angeles, ca, there, are, 7, distinct, zapotec, languages, and, over, 100, dialects, zapotec, is, a, tone, language, which, means, that, the, meaning, of, a, word, is, often, determined, by, voice, pitch, tonemes, essential, for, understanding, the, meaning, of, different, words, the, zapotec, languages, features, up, to, 4, distinct, tonemes, high, low, rising, and, falling, between, monte, alban, phases, 1, and, 2, there, was, a, considerable, expansion, of, the, population, of, the, valley, of, oaxaca, as, the, population, grew, so, did, the, degree, of, social, differentiation, the, centralization, of, political, power, and, ceremonial, activity, during, monte, alban, 1, 2, the, valley, appears, to, have, been, fragmented, into, several, independent, states, as, manifested, in, regional, centers, of, power, by, monte, alban, phase, 3, the, fragmentation, between, the, city, and, the, valleys, resulted, in, a, swell, in, the, population, and, urban, development, of, monte, alb, n, itself, the, central, valleys, of, oaxaca, the, cradle, of, zapotec, civilization, are, three, broad, valleys, etla, in, the, west, ocotl, n, in, the, south, and, mitla, in, the, east, that, join, at, an, altitude, of, about, 4500, feet, above, sea, level, in, the, center, of, what, today, is, the, state, of, oaxaca, they, are, located, about, 200, km, south, of, mexico, city, mountains, surround, the, valley, with, the, sierra, norte, in, the, north, and, the, mountains, of, tlacolula, in, the, southeast, the, environment, is, well, suited, for, agriculture, and, is, considered, one, of, the, cradles, of, maize, it, is, estimated, that, at, the, time, of, the, emergence, of, zapotec, civilization, the, valley, soil, were, unaffected, by, the, erosion, seen, today, as, the, oak, and, pine, forests, covering, the, surrounding, mountains, had, not, yet, been, decimated, by, logging, there, is, a, dry, season, from, november, until, may, but, along, the, rivers, it, is, possible, to, plant, and, harvest, crops, twice, the, mountains, are, traversed, from, north, west, to, south, by, the, atoyac, river, which, provides, water, for, a, small, strip, of, land, bordering, the, river, when, it, periodically, floods, to, provide, water, for, crops, elsewhere, in, the, valley, away, from, the, river, the, zapotecs, used, canal, irrigation, by, using, water, from, small, streams, the, zapotecs, were, able, to, bring, water, to, monte, alb, n, situated, 400, meters, above, the, valley, floor, archaeologists, found, remains, of, a, small, irrigation, system, consisting, of, a, dam, and, a, canal, on, the, south, eastern, flank, of, the, mountain, as, this, would, not, have, been, enough, to, support, all, the, population, of, monte, alb, n, it, is, assumed, that, there, were, many, other, irrigation, systems, likewise, crops, grown, in, the, valley, were, not, enough, to, sustain, the, rapid, population, growth, in, the, monte, alb, n, i, phase, therefore, crops, were, grown, on, the, foothills, where, the, soil, is, a, less, fertile, and, artificial, irrigation, was, needed, innovation, of, farming, enabled, the, zapotec, to, pay, tribute, to, the, spanish, conquerors, and, create, enough, surplus, to, feed, themselves, despite, natural, disasters, and, disease, the, zapotecs, developed, a, calendar, and, a, logosyllabic, system, of, writing, that, used, a, separate, glyph, to, represent, each, of, the, syllables, of, the, language, this, writing, system, is, thought, to, be, one, of, the, first, writing, systems, of, mesoamerica, and, a, predecessor, of, those, developed, by, the, maya, mixtec, and, aztec, civilizations, there, is, debate, as, to, whether, olmec, symbols, dated, to, 650, bc, are, actually, a, form, of, writing, preceding, the, oldest, zapotec, writing, dated, to, about, 500, bc, in, the, aztec, capital, of, tenochtitlan, there, were, zapotec, and, mixtec, artisans, who, fashioned, jewelry, for, the, aztec, rulers, tlatoanis, including, moctezuma, ii, however, relations, with, central, mexico, go, back, much, further, as, suggested, by, the, archaeological, remains, of, a, zapotec, neighborhood, within, teotihuacan, and, a, teotihuacan, style, guest, house, in, monte, alb, n, other, important, pre, columbian, zapotec, sites, include, lambityeco, dainz, mitla, yagul, san, jos, mogote, el, palmillo, and, zaachila, the, zapotecs, were, a, sedentary, culture, living, in, villages, and, towns, in, houses, constructed, with, stone, and, mortar, they, recorded, the, principal, events, in, their, history, by, means, of, hieroglyphics, and, in, warfare, they, made, use, of, a, cotton, armour, the, well, known, ruins, of, mitla, have, been, attributed, to, them, the, various, regions, often, employed, different, hunting, methods, most, notable, is, the, deer, catapult, described, by, v, squez, d, vlla, as, a, young, tree, bent, over, with, the, help, of, the, hunting, party, held, down, by, vines, the, deer, will, wander, into, and, trigger, the, trap, at, which, point, the, deer, would, be, ensnared, and, flung, into, the, canopy, killed, by, impacting, with, trees, or, in, the, case, of, a, canyon, the, deer, will, be, flung, into, the, canyon, side, at, monte, alb, n, archaeologists, have, found, extended, text, in, a, glyphic, script, some, signs, can, be, recognized, as, calendar, information, but, the, script, as, such, remains, undeciphered, read, in, columns, from, top, to, bottom, its, execution, is, somewhat, cruder, than, that, of, the, later, classic, maya, and, this, has, led, epigraphers, to, believe, that, the, script, was, also, less, phonetic, than, the, largely, syllabic, mayan, script, the, earliest, known, artifact, with, zapotec, writing, is, a, danzante, dancer, stone, officially, known, as, monument, 3, found, in, san, jos, mogote, oaxaca, it, has, a, relief, of, what, appears, to, be, a, dead, and, bloodied, captive, with, two, glyphic, signs, between, his, legs, possibly, his, name, first, dated, to, 500, 600, bc, this, was, initially, considered, the, earliest, writing, in, mesoamerica, however, doubts, have, been, expressed, as, to, this, dating, as, the, monument, may, have, been, reused, the, zapotec, script, appears, to, have, gone, out, of, use, in, the, late, classic, period, like, most, mesoamerican, religious, systems, the, zapotec, religion, was, polytheistic, some, known, deities, were, cocijo, the, rain, god, similar, to, the, aztec, god, tlaloc, coquihani, the, god, of, light, and, pitao, cozobi, the, god, of, maize, zapotec, deities, were, predominantly, associated, with, fertility, or, agriculture, both, male, and, female, deities, are, represented, differentiated, by, costume, males, are, depicted, wearing, breechclouts, with, or, without, capes, while, females, are, depicted, wearing, skirts, there, is, some, evidence, of, worship, of, deities, not, directly, associated, with, zapotec, culture, such, as, the, teotihuacan, feathered, serpent, butterfly, god, and, rain, god, and, the, nahuatl, god, of, spring, xipe, totec, it, is, believed, that, the, zapotec, used, human, sacrifice, in, some, of, their, rituals, there, are, several, legends, of, the, origin, of, the, zapotec, one, of, them, is, that, they, were, the, original, people, of, the, valley, of, oaxaca, and, were, born, from, rocks, or, descended, from, big, cats, such, as, pumas, jaguars, and, ocelots, another, is, that, the, zapotec, settled, in, the, oaxaca, valley, after, founding, the, toltec, empire, and, were, descendants, of, the, people, of, chicomoztoc, these, legends, were, not, transcribed, until, after, the, spanish, conquest, according, to, historical, and, contemporary, zapotec, legends, their, ancestors, emerged, from, the, earth, from, caves, or, turned, into, people, from, trees, or, jaguars, their, governing, elite, believed, that, they, descended, from, supernatural, beings, who, lived, among, the, clouds, and, that, upon, death, they, would, return, to, the, clouds, the, name, by, which, zapotecs, are, known, today, results, from, this, belief, the, zapotecs, of, the, central, valleys, call, themselves, be, ena, za, a, the, cloud, people, the, zapotec, used, dedication, rituals, to, sanctify, their, living, spaces, and, structures, excavation, of, mound, iii, at, the, cuilapan, temple, pyramid, in, oaxaca, revealed, a, dedication, cache, containing, many, jade, beads, two, jade, earspools, three, obsidian, blades, shells, stones, a, pearl, and, small, animal, bones, likely, from, birds, dated, to, 700, ad, each, of, these, materials, symbolized, different, religious, concepts, as, it, was, not, easily, attainable, jade, was, valued, and, worked, jade, even, more, so, because, the, elite, were, the, primary, artists, obsidian, blades, are, associated, with, sacrifice, as, they, were, commonly, used, in, bloodletting, rituals, shells, and, pearl, represent, the, underworld, being, from, the, ocean, and, the, small, bird, bones, represent, the, sky, and, its, relation, to, the, balanced, cosmos, these, artifacts, are, significant, due, to, their, placement, in, a, structure, used, for, ritual, and, associated, with, power, this, cache, is, a, form, of, dedication, ritual, dedicating, the, cuilapan, temple, pyramid, to, these, ideas, of, power, sacrifice, and, the, relationship, between, underworld, and, cosmos
