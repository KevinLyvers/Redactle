formations, of, the, army, and, its, attached, air, force, under, navy, command, while, formerly, the, ija, consumed, the, majority, of, the, state, s, military, budget, with, a, 73, 27, split, in, 1940, from, 1942, to, 1945, there, would, instead, be, a, roughly, 60, 40, split, in, funds, between, the, army, and, the, navy, japan, s, key, initial, objective, was, to, seize, economic, resources, in, the, dutch, east, indies, and, malaya, to, escape, the, effects, of, the, allied, embargo, this, was, known, as, the, southern, plan, it, was, decided, because, of, the, close, relationship, between, the, uk, and, the, us, and, the, belief, that, the, us, would, inevitably, become, involved, that, japan, would, also, take, the, philippines, wake, and, guam, japanese, planning, was, for, a, limited, war, where, japan, would, seize, key, objectives, and, then, establish, a, defensive, perimeter, to, defeat, allied, counterattacks, which, in, turn, would, lead, to, a, negotiated, peace, the, early, war, was, divided, into, two, operational, phases, the, first, operational, phase, was, further, divided, into, three, separate, parts, in, which, the, major, objectives, of, the, philippines, british, malaya, borneo, burma, rabaul, and, the, dutch, east, indies, would, be, occupied, the, second, operational, phase, called, for, further, expansion, into, the, south, pacific, by, seizing, eastern, new, guinea, new, britain, fiji, samoa, and, strategic, points, in, the, australian, area, in, the, central, pacific, midway, was, targeted, as, were, the, aleutian, islands, in, the, north, pacific, seizure, of, these, key, areas, would, provide, defensive, depth, and, deny, the, allies, staging, areas, from, which, to, mount, a, counteroffensive, by, november, these, plans, were, essentially, complete, and, were, modified, only, slightly, over, the, next, month, japanese, military, planners, expectation, of, success, rested, on, the, united, kingdom, and, the, soviet, union, being, unable, to, effectively, respond, to, a, japanese, attack, because, of, the, threat, posed, to, each, by, germany, the, soviet, union, was, seen, as, unlikely, to, commence, hostilities, the, japanese, leadership, was, aware, that, a, total, military, victory, in, a, traditional, sense, against, the, us, was, impossible, the, alternative, would, be, negotiating, for, peace, after, their, initial, victories, which, would, recognize, japanese, hegemony, in, asia, following, prolonged, tensions, between, japan, and, the, western, powers, units, of, the, ijn, and, ija, launched,

destroyed, 188, american, aircraft, and, killed, 2, 403, americans, the, japanese, believed, that, the, americans, faced, with, such, a, sudden, and, massive, blow, would, agree, to, a, negotiated, settlement, american, losses, were, less, serious, than, initially, thought, the, three, american, aircraft, carriers, were, at, sea, and, vital, naval, infrastructure, submarine, base, and, signals, intelligence, units, were, unscathed, and, the, fact, the, bombing, happened, while, the, us, was, not, officially, at, war, caused, a, wave, of, outrage, across, the, us, japan, s, fallback, strategy, relying, on, a, war, of, attrition, was, beyond, the, imperial, japanese, navy, s, capabilities, opposition, to, war, in, the, us, vanished, after, the, attack, on, 8, december, the, united, kingdom, the, united, states, canada, and, the, netherlands, declared, war, on, japan, followed, by, australia, the, next, day, thailand, with, its, territory, already, serving, as, a, springboard,

the, pacific, struggle, as, primarily, one, in, which, the, united, states, and, australia, must, have, the, fullest, say, in, the, direction, of, the, democracies, fighting, plan, without, inhibitions, of, any, kind, i, make, it, clear, that, australia, looks, to, america, free, of, any, pangs, as, to, our, traditional, links, or, kinship, with, the, united, kingdom, australia, had, been, shocked, by, the, speed, of, the, collapse, of, british, malaya, and, the, fall, of, singapore, in, which, around, 15, 000, australian, soldiers, became, prisoners, of, war, curtin, predicted, the, battle, for, australia, would, soon, follow, the, japanese, established, a, major, base, in, the, australian, territory, of, new, guinea, beginning, with, the, capture, of, rabaul, on, 23, january, 1942, on, 19, february, 1942, darwin, was, hit, by, an, air, raid, the, first, time, the, australian, mainland, had, been, attacked, over, the, following, 19, months, australia, was, attacked, from, the, air, almost, 100, times, in, early, 1942, elements, of, the, ijn, proposed, an, invasion, of, australia, the, ija, opposed, the, plan, and, it, was, rejected, in, favour, of, a, policy, of, isolating, australia, via, blockade, by, advancing, through, the, south, pacific, the, japanese, decided, upon, a, seaborne, invasion, of, port, moresby, which, would, put, northern, australia, within, range, of, japanese, bomber, aircraft, president, franklin, roosevelt, ordered, macarthur, to, formulate, a, pacific, defence, plan, with, australia, in, march, 1942, curtin, agreed, to, place, australian, forces, under, the, command, of, macarthur, who, became, supreme, commander, south, west, pacific, macarthur, moved, his, headquarters, to, melbourne, in, march, 1942, and, american, troops, began, massing, in, australia, enemy, naval, activity, reached, sydney, in, late, may, 1942, when, japanese, midget, submarines, launched, a, raid, on, sydney, harbour, on, 8, june, 1942, two, japanese, submarines, briefly, shelled, sydney, s, eastern, suburbs, and, the, city, of, newcastle, in, early, 1942, the, governments, of, smaller, powers, began, to, push, for, an, inter, governmental, asia, pacific, war, council, the, pacific, war, council, was, formed, in, washington, dc, on, 1, april, 1942, with, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, his, key, advisor, harry, hopkins, and, representatives, from, britain, china, australia, the, netherlands, new, zealand, and, canada, representatives, from, india, and, the, philippines, were, later, added, the, council, never, had, any, direct, operational, control, and, any, decisions, it, made, were, referred, to, the, us, uk, combined, chiefs, of, staff, australian, and, dutch, forces, led, civilians, in, a, prolonged, guerilla, campaign, in, portuguese, timor, the, second, operational, phase, was, planned, to, expand, japan, s, strategic, depth, by, adding, eastern, new, guinea, new, britain, the, aleutians, midway, fiji, samoa, and, strategic, points, in, the, australian, area, the, naval, general, staff, advocated, an, advance, to, the, south, to, seize, parts, of, australia, but, with, large, numbers, of, troops, engaged, in, china, and, manchuria, the, imperial, army, declined, to, contribute, the, forces, necessary, the, naval, general, staff, still, wanted, to, cut, the, sea, links, between, australia, and, the, us, by, capturing, new, caledonia, fiji, and, samoa, because, this, required, far, fewer, troops, on, 13, march, the, naval, general, staff, and, the, army, agreed, to, operations, with, the, goal, of, capturing, fiji, and, samoa, the, second, operational, phase, began, well, when, lae, and, salamaua, located, in, eastern, new, guinea, were, captured, on, 8, march, however, on, 10, march, american, carrier, aircraft, attacked, the, invasion, forces, and, inflicted, considerable, losses, the, raid, had, major, operational, implications, because, it, forced, the, japanese, to, stop, their, advance, in, the, south, pacific, until, the, combined, fleet, provided, the, means, to, protect, future, operations, concurrently, the, doolittle, raid, occurred, in, april, 1942, where, 16, bombers, took, off, from, the, aircraft, carrier, uss, hornet, 600, miles, 970, km, from, japan, the, raid, inflicted, minimal, material, damage, on, japanese, soil, but, was, a, morale, boost, for, the, us, it, also, had, psychological, repercussions, in, japan, exposing, the, danger, to, the, japanese, homeland, from, american, carrier, forces, with, only, marcus, island, and, a, line, of, converted, trawlers, patrolling, the, vast, waters, that, separate, wake, and, kamchatka, the, japanese, east, coast, was, left, open, to, attack, admiral, yamamoto, proposed, to, achieve, the, destruction, of, the, us, navy, by, occupying, midway, atoll, an, objective, he, thought, the, americans, would, be, certain, to, fight, for, as, midway, was, close, enough, to, threaten, hawaii, during, a, series, of, meetings, held, from, 2, 5, april, the, naval, general, staff, and, representatives, of, the, combined, fleet, reached, a, compromise, yamamoto, got, his, midway, operation, but, only, after, he, had, threatened, to, resign, in, return, yamamoto, had, to, allocate, one, carrier, division, to, the, operation, against, port, moresby, and, include, an, attack, to, seize, strategic, points, in, the, aleutian, islands, simultaneously, with, the, midway, operation, these, were, enough, to, remove, the, japanese, margin, of, superiority, in, the, midway, attack, the, attack, on, port, moresby, was, codenamed, mo, operation, and, was, divided, into, several, parts, tulagi, would, be, occupied, on, 3, may, the, carriers, would, then, conduct, a, sweep, through, the, coral, sea, to, find, and, destroy, allied, naval, forces, with, the, landings, conducted, to, capture, port, moresby, scheduled, for, 10, may, the, mo, operation, featured, a, force, of, 60, ships, led, by, two, carriers, and, 250, aircraft, however, the, actual, battle, did, not, go, according, to, plan, although, tulagi, was, seized, on, 3, may, the, following, day, aircraft, from, the, american, carrier, yorktown, struck, the, invasion, force, the, element, of, surprise, was, lost, due, to, the, success, of, allied, codebreakers, from, the, allied, point, of, view, if, port, moresby, fell, the, japanese, would, control, the, seas, to, the, north, and, west, of, australia, and, could, isolate, the, country, an, allied, task, force, under, the, command, of, admiral, frank, fletcher, with, the, carriers, uss, lexington, and, yorktown, was, assembled, to, stop, the, japanese, advance, on, 7, may, the, japanese, carriers, launched, a, full, strike, on, a, contact, reported, to, be, enemy, carriers, but, the, report, turned, out, to, be, false, the, strike, force, found, and, struck, only, an, oiler, the, neosho, and, the, destroyer, sims, the, american, carriers, also, launched, a, strike, with, incomplete, reconnaissance, and, only, located, and, sank, the, light, aircraft, carrier, sh, h, on, 8, may, the, opposing, carrier, forces, finally, found, each, other, and, exchanged, air, strikes, aircraft, from, the, two, japanese, carriers, succeeded, in, sinking, the, carrier, lexington, and, damaging, yorktown, in, return, the, americans, damaged, sh, kaku, although, zuikaku, was, left, undamaged, aircraft, and, personnel, losses, to, zuikaku, were, heavy, and, the, japanese, were, unable, to, support, a, landing, on, port, moresby, as, a, result, mo, operation, was, cancelled, and, the, japanese, were, forced, to, abandon, their, attempts, to, isolate, australia, although, they, managed, to, sink, a, carrier, the, battle, was, a, disaster, for, the, japanese, as, all, three, carriers, that, were, committed, to, the, battle, would, now, be, unavailable, for, the, operation, against, midway, after, coral, sea, the, japanese, had, four, fleet, carriers, operational, s, ry, kaga, akagi, and, hiry, and, believed, that, the, americans, had, a, maximum, of, two, enterprise, and, hornet, saratoga, was, undergoing, repair, after, a, torpedo, attack, while, yorktown, had, been, damaged, at, coral, sea, and, was, believed, by, japanese, naval, intelligence, to, have, been, sunk, she, would, sortie, for, midway, after, just, three, days, of, repairs, admiral, yamamoto, viewed, the, operation, against, midway, as, the, potentially, decisive, battle, of, the, war, which, could, lead, to, the, destruction, of, american, strategic, power, in, the, pacific, and, subsequently, allow, for, a, negotiated, peace, settlement, through, strategic, and, tactical, surprise, the, japanese, would, knock, out, midway, s, air, strength, and, soften, it, for, a, landing, by, 5, 000, troops, after, the, quick, capture, of, the, island, the, combined, fleet, would, lay, the, basis, for, the, most, important, part, of, the, operation, yamamoto, hoped, that, the, attack, would, lure, the, americans, into, a, trap, midway, was, to, be, bait, for, the, usn, which, would, depart, pearl, harbor, to, counterattack, when, the, americans, arrived, he, would, concentrate, his, scattered, forces, to, defeat, them, an, important, aspect, of, the, scheme, was, operation, al, which, was, the, plan, to, seize, two, islands, in, the, aleutians, concurrently, with, the, attack, on, midway, in, may, us, intelligence, codebreakers, discovered, the, planned, attack, on, midway, yamamoto, s, complex, plan, had, no, provision, for, intervention, by, the, american, fleet, before, the, japanese, had, expected, them, planned, surveillance, of, the, american, fleet, in, pearl, harbor, by, long, ranged, seaplanes, did, not, occur, as, a, result, of, an, abortive, identical, operation, in, march, japanese, submarine, scouting, lines, that, were, supposed, to, be, in, place, along, the, hawaiian, islands, were, not, completed, on, time, the, battle, began, on, 3, june, when, american, aircraft, from, midway, spotted, and, attacked, the, japanese, transport, group, 700, miles, 1, 100, km, west, of, the, atoll, on, 4, june, the, japanese, launched, a, 108, aircraft, strike, on, the, island, but, failed, to, deliver, a, decisive, blow, to, the, island, s, facilities, the, strike, aircraft, based, on, midway, had, already, departed, adding, to, the, 116, carrier, aircraft, on, their, way, to, attack, the, japanese, the, aircraft, from, midway, attacked, but, failed, to, score, a, single, hit, in, the, middle, of, these, uncoordinated, attacks, a, japanese, scout, aircraft, reported, the, presence, of, an, american, task, force, but, it, was, not, until, later, that, the, presence, of, an, american, carrier, was, confirmed, vice, admiral, chuichi, nagumo, was, put, in, a, difficult, tactical, situation, after, quick, deliberation, he, opted, for, a, delayed, but, better, prepared, attack, on, the, american, task, force, at, 10, 22am, american, sbd, dauntless, dive, bombers, surprised, and, attacked, three, of, the, japanese, carriers, s, ry, kaga, and, akagi, were, destroyed, a, single, japanese, carrier, hiry, remained, operational, and, launched, an, immediate, counterattack, both, of, her, attacks, hit, yorktown, and, put, her, out, of, action, later, in, the, afternoon, aircraft, from, the, two, remaining, american, carriers, found, and, destroyed, hiry, the, crippled, yorktown, along, with, the, destroyer, hammann, were, sunk, by, the, japanese, submarine, i, 168, with, the, striking, power, of, the, kido, butai, having, been, destroyed, japan, s, offensive, power, was, blunted, early, on, the, morning, of, 5, june, the, japanese, cancelled, the, midway, operation, japanese, land, forces, continued, to, advance, in, the, solomon, islands, and, new, guinea, from, july, 1942, a, few, australian, reserve, battalions, fought, a, stubborn, rearguard, action, in, new, guinea, against, a, japanese, advance, along, the, kokoda, track, towards, port, moresby, the, militia, were, relieved, in, late, august, by, troops, from, the, second, australian, imperial, force, in, early, september, 1942, japanese, marines, attacked, a, strategic, royal, australian, air, force, base, at, milne, bay, near, the, eastern, tip, of, new, guinea, they, were, beaten, back, by, allied, forces, the, first, defeat, of, the, war, for, japanese, forces, on, land, on, new, guinea, the, japanese, on, the, kokoda, track, were, within, sight, of, port, moresby, but, were, ordered, to, withdraw, to, the, northeastern, coast, australian, and, us, forces, attacked, their, fortified, positions, and, after, more, than, two, months, of, fighting, in, the, buna, gona, area, finally, captured, the, key, japanese, beachhead, in, early, 1943, allied, forces, became, aware, through, coastwatchers, of, a, japanese, airfield, under, construction, at, guadalcanal, on, 7, august, 1942, 16, 000, us, marines, landed, on, guadalcanal, and, tulagi, in, the, solomons, vice, admiral, gunichi, mikawa, commander, of, the, newly, formed, eighth, fleet, at, rabaul, quickly, sailed, to, engage, the, allied, force, off, the, coast, of, guadalcanal, on, the, night, of, 8, 9, august, mikawa, s, quick, response, resulted, in, the, battle, of, savo, island, a, japanese, victory, during, which, four, allied, heavy, cruisers, were, sunk, while, no, japanese, ships, were, lost, it, was, one, of, the, worst, allied, naval, defeats, of, the, war, the, victory, was, mitigated, only, by, the, failure, of, the, japanese, to, attack, the, vulnerable, transports, had, they, done, so, the, first, american, counterattack, in, the, pacific, could, have, been, stopped, the, japanese, originally, perceived, the, american, landings, as, nothing, more, than, a, reconnaissance, with, japanese, and, allied, forces, occupying, parts, of, the, island, over, the, following, six, months, both, sides, poured, resources, into, an, escalating, battle, of, attrition, us, air, cover, based, at, henderson, field, ensured, american, control, of, the, waters, around, guadalcanal, during, daytime, while, superior, night, fighting, capabilities, of, the, ijn, gave, the, japanese, the, advantage, at, night, in, august, japanese, and, us, carrier, forces, engaged, in, the, battle, of, the, eastern, solomons, resulting, in, the, sinking, of, the, light, carrier, ryujo, in, october, us, forces, successfully, challenged, the, japanese, in, night, fighting, during, the, battle, of, cape, esperance, sinking, one, japanese, cruiser, and, one, destroyer, for, the, loss, of, one, destroyer, during, the, night, of, 13, october, two, japanese, fast, battleships, kongo, and, haruna, bombarded, henderson, field, the, airfield, was, temporarily, disabled, but, quickly, returned, to, service, on, 26, october, the, japanese, carriers, shokaku, and, zuikaku, sank, hornet, and, heavily, damaged, enterprise, in, the, battle, of, the, santa, cruz, islands, the, loss, of, hornet, coupled, with, the, earlier, loss, of, wasp, to, the, ijn, submarine, i, 19, and, heavy, submarine, damage, to, saratoga, in, september, meant, that, us, carrier, strength, in, the, region, was, reduced, to, a, single, ship, enterprise, however, the, two, ijn, carriers, had, to, retire, to, home, waters, from, 12, to, 15, november, japanese, and, american, surface, ships, engaged, in, night, actions, in, the, naval, battle, of, guadalcanal, one, of, the, only, two, battles, in, the, pacific, war, during, which, battleships, fought, each, other, two, us, admirals, were, killed, and, two, japanese, battleships, sunk, during, the, campaign, most, of, the, japanese, aircraft, based, in, the, south, pacific, were, redeployed, to, the, defense, of, guadalcanal, many, were, lost, in, engagements, with, the, allied, air, forces, japanese, ground, forces, launched, repeated, attacks, on, heavily, defended, us, positions, around, henderson, field, but, suffered, high, casualties, to, sustain, these, offensives, resupply, was, carried, out, by, japanese, convoys, termed, the, tokyo, express, by, the, allies, the, convoys, often, faced, night, battles, with, enemy, naval, forces, fleet, battles, involving, heavier, ships, and, even, daytime, carrier, battles, resulted, in, a, stretch, of, water, near, guadalcanal, becoming, known, as, ironbottom, sound, from, the, multitude, of, ships, sunk, however, the, allies, were, much, better, able, to, replace, these, losses, the, japanese, evacuated, the, island, and, withdrew, in, february, 1943, in, the, six, month, war, of, attrition, the, japanese, had, lost, as, a, result, of, failing, to, commit, enough, forces, in, sufficient, time, by, late, 1942, japanese, headquarters, had, decided, to, make, guadalcanal, their, priority, the, americans, hoped, to, use, their, numerical, advantage, at, guadalcanal, to, progressively, drain, japanese, manpower, ultimately, nearly, 20, 000, japanese, died, on, guadalcanal, compared, to, just, over, 7, 000, americans, in, mainland, china, the, japanese, 3rd, 6th, and, 40th, divisions, a, total, of, around, 120, 000, troops, massed, at, yueyang, and, advanced, southward, in, three, columns, attempting, again, to, cross, the, miluo, river, to, reach, changsha, in, january, 1942, chinese, forces, scored, a, victory, at, changsha, the, first, allied, success, against, japan, after, the, doolittle, raid, the, ija, conducted, the, zhejiang, jiangxi, campaign, with, the, goal, of, locating, surviving, american, airmen, applying, retribution, on, the, chinese, who, aided, them, and, destroying, air, bases, this, operation, started, on, 15, may, 1942, with, 40, infantry, and, 15, 16, artillery, battalions, but, was, repelled, by, chinese, forces, in, september, during, this, campaign, the, ija, engaged, in, biological, warfare, spreading, cholera, typhoid, plague, and, dysentery, pathogens, chinese, estimates, put, the, death, toll, at, 250, 000, civilians, around, 1, 700, japanese, troops, died, out, of, a, total, 10, 000, who, fell, ill, when, japanese, biological, weapons, infected, their, own, forces, on, 2, november, 1943, isamu, yokoyama, commander, of, the, imperial, japanese, 11th, army, deployed, around, 100, 000, troops, to, attack, changde, during, the, seven, week, battle, of, changde, the, chinese, forced, japan, to, fight, a, campaign, of, attrition, although, the, japanese, captured, the, city, the, chinese, were, able, to, pin, them, down, long, enough, for, reinforcements, to, arrive, and, encircle, them, the, chinese, then, cut, japanese, supply, lines, provoking, a, retreat, and, chinese, pursuit, during, the, battle, japan, used, chemical, weapons, in, the, aftermath, of, the, japanese, conquest, of, burma, there, was, widespread, disorder, and, pro, independence, agitation, in, eastern, india, and, a, famine, in, bengal, causing, up, to, 3, million, deaths, wavell, commander, in, chief, in, india, was, eager, to, mount, counterattacks, into, burma, one, attack, was, an, offensive, in, arakan, intended, to, secure, akyab, island, important, for, its, port, and, airfield, the, 14th, indian, infantry, division, advanced, overland, down, the, mayu, peninsula, the, offensive, was, stalled, at, rathedaung, and, donbaik, only, a, few, miles, north, of, akyab, by, numerically, inferior, japanese, forces, who, occupied, bunkers, repeated, assaults, from, january, to, march, 1943, failed, to, overcome, these, positions, a, japanese, division, moved, to, arakan, from, central, burma, and, attacked, the, 14th, indian, division, s, exposed, left, flank, overrunning, several, units, the, headquarters, of, the, 26th, indian, infantry, division, took, over, the, front, and, intended, to, mount, a, riposte, but, their, troops, were, exhausted, and, the, division, was, forced, to, fall, back, to, the, indian, frontier, in, the, first, week, in, may, most, officers, accepted, that, the, failure, resulted, from, inadequate, training, for, jungle, warfare, to, offset, the, results, of, the, arakan, offensive, the, allies, widely, publicised, a, long, distance, raid, mounted, by, the, chindits, under, brigadier, orde, charles, wingate, the, chindits, suffered, heavy, losses, 1, 138, out, of, a, force, of, just, over, 3, 000, and, had, inflicted, only, minor, damage, to, the, japanese, lines, of, communication, wingate, insisted, that, ordinary, british, and, indian, troops, could, fight, in, the, jungle, as, easily, as, the, japanese, the, raid, also, contributed, to, the, japanese, decision, to, invade, india, during, 1944, in, august, 1943, the, allies, formed, a, new, south, east, asia, command, seac, to, take, over, strategic, responsibilities, for, burma, and, india, from, the, commander, in, chief, india, who, headed, the, british, indian, army, in, october, 1943, winston, churchill, appointed, admiral, lord, louis, mountbatten, as, its, supreme, commander, wavell, was, appointed, viceroy, of, india, and, immediately, took, measures, to, address, the, famine, in, bengal, general, claude, auchinleck, became, commander, in, chief, of, the, indian, army, and, revitalised, its, administration, and, training, establishments, the, british, and, indian, fourteenth, army, was, formed, to, face, the, japanese, in, burma, under, lieutenant, general, william, slim, its, training, morale, and, health, greatly, improved, the, american, general, joseph, stilwell, who, commanded, us, forces, in, the, china, burma, india, theater, directed, aid, to, china, and, prepared, to, construct, the, ledo, road, to, link, india, and, china, in, 1943, the, thai, phayap, army, invasion, headed, to, xishuangbanna, in, china, but, were, driven, back, by, the, chinese, expeditionary, force, after, midway, the, us, used, its, vast, industrial, potential, to, make, more, ships, planes, and, train, its, aircrews, at, the, same, time, japan, lacking, an, adequate, industrial, base, or, technological, strategy, a, good, aircrew, training, program, or, adequate, naval, resources, and, commerce, defense, fell, behind, the, allies, began, a, long, movement, across, the, pacific, seizing, several, island, bases, some, japanese, strongholds, like, truk, rabaul, and, formosa, were, neutralized, by, air, attack, and, bypassed, the, goal, was, to, get, close, to, japan, itself, then, launch, massive, strategic, air, attacks, improve, the, submarine, blockade, and, finally, only, if, necessary, execute, an, invasion, the, us, navy, did, not, seek, out, the, japanese, fleet, for, a, decisive, battle, the, allied, advance, could, only, be, stopped, by, a, japanese, naval, attack, which, oil, shortages, induced, by, submarine, attack, made, impossible, in, june, 1943, the, allies, launched, operation, cartwheel, a, series, of, amphibious, invasions, to, recapture, the, solomon, islands, and, new, guinea, and, ultimately, isolate, the, major, japanese, forward, base, at, rabaul, following, the, japanese, invasion, of, salamaua, lae, in, march, 1942, cartwheel, began, with, the, salamaua, lae, campaign, in, northern, new, guinea, in, april, 1943, which, was, followed, in, june, to, october, by, the, new, georgia, campaign, in, which, the, allies, used, the, landings, on, rendova, drive, on, munda, point, and, battle, of, munda, point, to, secure, a, secretly, constructed, japanese, airfield, at, munda, and, the, rest, of, new, georgia, islands, group, landings, from, september, until, december, secured, the, treasury, islands, and, landed, allied, troops, on, choiseul, bougainville, and, cape, gloucester, these, landings, prepared, the, way, for, nimitz, s, island, hopping, campaign, towards, japan, in, november, 1943, us, marines, sustained, high, casualties, when, they, overwhelmed, the, 4, 500, strong, garrison, at, tarawa, this, experience, drove, the, allies, to, improve, their, techniques, of, amphibious, landings, implementing, changes, such, as, thorough, pre, emptive, bombings, and, bombardment, more, careful, planning, regarding, tides, and, landing, schedules, and, better, coordination, operations, on, the, gilberts, were, followed, in, late, january, and, mid, february, 1944, by, further, less, costly, landings, on, the, marshall, islands, on, 22, november, 1943, us, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, british, prime, minister, winston, churchill, and, roc, generalissimo, chiang, kai, shek, met, in, cairo, egypt, to, discuss, a, strategy, to, defeat, japan, the, meeting, was, also, known, as, the, cairo, conference, and, concluded, with, the, cairo, declaration, us, submarines, as, well, as, some, british, and, dutch, vessels, operating, from, bases, at, cavite, in, the, philippines, 1941, 42, fremantle, and, brisbane, australia, pearl, harbor, trincomalee, ceylon, midway, and, later, guam, played, a, major, role, in, defeating, japan, even, though, submarines, made, up, a, small, proportion, of, the, allied, navies, less, than, two, percent, in, the, case, of, the, us, navy, submarines, strangled, japan, by, sinking, its, merchant, fleet, intercepting, many, troop, transports, and, cutting, off, nearly, all, the, oil, imports, essential, to, weapons, production, and, military, operations, by, early, 1945, japanese, oil, supplies, were, so, limited, that, its, fleet, was, virtually, stranded, the, japanese, military, claimed, its, defenses, sank, 468, allied, submarines, during, the, war, in, reality, only, 42, american, submarines, were, sunk, in, the, pacific, due, to, hostile, action, with, 10, others, lost, in, accidents, or, as, the, result, of, friendly, fire, the, dutch, lost, five, submarines, due, to, japanese, attack, or, minefields, and, the, british, lost, three, american,

doctrine, unrestricted, submarine, warfare, against, japan, this, meant, sinking, any, warship, commercial, vessel, or, passenger, ship, in, axis, controlled, waters, without, warning, and, without, aiding, survivors, the, us, had, a, long, supply, line, leaving, it, vulnerable, to, submarine, attack, but, japan, used, its, submarines, primarily, for, long, range, reconnaissance, and, only, occasionally, attacked, us, supply, lines, as, the, war, turned, against, japan, ijn, submarines, increasingly, served, to, resupply, strongholds, which, had, been, cut, off, such, as, truk, and, rabaul, in, addition, japan, honored, its, neutrality, treaty, with, the, soviet, union, and, ignored, american, freighters, shipping, military, supplies, from, san, francisco, to, vladivostok, much, to, the, consternation, of, its, german, ally, the, us, navy, by, contrast, relied, on, commerce, raiding, from, the, outset, however, the, problem, of, allied, forces, surrounded, in, the, philippines, in, early, 1942, led, to, diversion, of, boats, to, guerrilla, submarine, missions, basing, in, australia, placed, boats, under, japanese, aerial, threat, while, en, route, to, patrol,

proved, defective, and, were, not, corrected, until, september, 1943, before, the, war, a, us, customs, officer, had, seized, a, copy, of, the, japanese, merchant, marine, code, not, knowing, that, the, office, of, naval, intelligence, had, broken, it, the, japanese, promptly, changed, it, and, the, new, code, was, not, broken, again, by, op, 20, g, until, 1943, in, 1944, the, us, navy, restructured, their, submarine, fleet, installing, effective, shipboard, radar, on, its, 150, submarines, replacing, commanders, deemed, lacking, in, aggression, and, fixing, the, faults, in, the, torpedoes, japanese, commerce, protection, was, shiftless, beyond, description, and, convoys, were, poorly, organized, and, defended, compared, to, allied, ones, the, number, of, american, submarines, patrols, and, sinkings, rose, steeply, 350, patrols, 180, ships, sunk, in, 1942, 350, 335, in, 1943, and, 520, 603, in, 1944, by, 1945, sinkings, of, japanese, vessels, had, decreased, because, there, were, less, ships, available, to, target, in, all, allied, submarines, destroyed, 1, 200, merchant, ships, about, five, million, tons, of, shipping, at, critical, stages, of, the, guadalcanal, saipan, and, leyte, campaigns, thousands, of, japanese, troops, were, killed, or, diverted, from, where, they, were, needed, over, 200, warships, were, sunk, including, a, battleship, and, no, fewer, than, eight, carriers, underwater, warfare, was, especially, dangerous, of, the, 16, 000, americans, who, went, out, on, patrol, 3, 500, 22, never, returned, the, highest, casualty, rate, of, any, american, force, in, world, war, ii, the, japanese, losses, 130, submarines, in, all, were, higher, in, mid, 1944, japan, mobilized, over, 500, 000, men, and, launched, an, operation, across, china, under, the, code, name, operation, ichi, go, their, largest, offensive, of, world, war, ii, with, the, goal, of, connecting, japanese, controlled, territory, in, china, and, french, indochina, and, capturing, airbases, in, southeastern, china, where, american, bombers, were, based, though, japan, suffered, about, 100, 000, casualties, these, attacks, the, biggest, in, several, years, gained, much, ground, for, japan, before, chinese, forces, stopped, the, incursions, in, guangxi, despite, major, tactical, victories, the, operation, overall, failed, to, provide, japan, with, any, significant, strategic, gains, a, majority, of, the, chinese, forces, were, able, to, retreat, out, of, the, area, and, later, come, back, to, attack, japanese, positions, at, the, battle, of, west, hunan, japanese, losses, in, the, pacific, meant, that, japan, never, got, the, time, and, resources, needed, to, achieve, victory, over, china, operation, ichi, go, created, a, sense, of, social, confusion, in, the, areas, of, china, that, it, affected, chinese, communist, guerrillas, were, able, to, exploit, this, confusion, to, gain, influence, and, control, of, greater, areas, of, the, countryside, in, the, aftermath, after, the, allied, setbacks, in, 1943, the, south, east, asia, command, prepared, to, launch, offensives, into, burma, on, several, fronts, in, early, 1944, the, chinese, and, american, troops, of, the, northern, combat, area, command, ncac, commanded, by, the, american, joseph, stilwell, began, extending, the, ledo, road, from, india, into, northern, burma, while, the, indian, xv, corps, began, an, advance, along, the, coast, in, arakan, province, in, february, 1944, the, japanese, mounted, a, local, counter, attack, in, arakan, after, early, japanese, success, this, counter, attack, was, defeated, in, the, battle, of, the, admin, box, when, the, isolated, indian, divisions, of, xv, corps, stood, firm, relying, on, supplies, dropped, by, parachute, the, japanese, launched, a, long, planned, offensive, codenamed, operation, u, go, into, india, in, mid, march, lieutenant, general, slim, commanding, fourteenth, army, and, his, forward, commander, lieutenant, general, geoffry, scoones, planned, to, withdraw, into, the, imphal, plain, and, force, the, japanese, to, fight, with, their, communications, stretching, over, scores, of, miles, of, jungle, trails, however, they, were, slow, to, respond, when, the, attack, was, launched, and, did, not, foresee, some, japanese, objectives, some, british, and, indian, units, had, to, fight, their, way, out, of, encirclement, but, by, early, april, they, had, concentrated, around, imphal, several, units, were, flown, from, the, arakan, to, reinforce, them, a, japanese, division, which, had, advanced, to, kohima, in, nagaland, cut, the, main, road, to, imphal, and, isolated, a, small, british, garrison, but, failed, to, capture, the, whole, of, the, defences, at, kohima, during, april, the, japanese, attacks, against, imphal, failed, while, fresh, allied, formations, relieved, the, garrison, of, kohima, and, drove, the, japanese, from, the, positions, they, had, captured, on, kohima, ridge, as, many, japanese, had, feared, their, inadequate, lines, of, communication, and, the, failure, of, mutaguchi, s, gamble, on, an, early, victory, meant, that, their, troops, starved, once, the, monsoon, rains, descended, in, mid, may, they, also, succumbed, to, disease, in, large, numbers, during, may, while, mutaguchi, continued, to, order, attacks, the, allies, advanced, southwards, from, kohima, and, northwards, from, imphal, the, two, allied, attacks, met, on, 22, june, breaking, the, japanese, siege, of, imphal, the, japanese, finally, broke, off, the, operation, on, 3, july, they, had, lost, over, 50, 000, troops, mainly, to, starvation, and, disease, the, worst, defeat, suffered, by, the, ija, to, that, date, although, the, advance, in, arakan, had, been, halted, to, release, troops, and, aircraft, for, the, battle, of, imphal, the, americans, and, chinese, had, continued, to, advance, in, northern, burma, aided, by, the, reinforced, chindits, operating, against, the, japanese, lines, of, communication, in, mid, 1944, the, chinese, expeditionary, force, invaded, northern, burma, they, captured, a, fortified, position, at, mount, song, by, the, time, campaigning, ceased, during, the, monsoon, the, northern, combat, area, command, had, secured, a, vital, airfield, at, myitkyina, after, a, prolonged, siege, which, eased, the, problems, of, air, resupply, from, india, to, china, over, the, hump, in, may, 1943, the, japanese, prepared, operation, z, or, the, z, plan, which, envisioned, the, use, of, japanese, naval, power, to, counter, american, forces, threatening, the, outer, defense, perimeter, line, from, the, aleutians, down, through, wake, the, marshall, and, gilbert, islands, nauru, the, bismarck, archipelago, new, guinea, then, westward, past, java, and, sumatra, to, burma, in, 1943, 44, allied, forces, in, the, solomons, began, driving, relentlessly, to, rabaul, eventually, encircling, and, neutralizing, the, stronghold, with, their, position, in, the, solomons, disintegrating, the, japanese, modified, the, z, plan, by, eliminating, the, gilbert, and, marshall, islands, and, the, bismarck, archipelago, as, vital, areas, to, be, defended, they, then, based, their, possible, actions, on, the, defense, of, an, inner, perimeter, which, included, the, marianas, palau, western, new, guinea, and, the, dutch, east, indies, meanwhile, in, the, central, pacific, the, americans, initiated, a, major, offensive, beginning, in, november, 1943, with, landings, in, the, gilbert, islands, japanese, garrisons, in, the, gilberts, and, then, the, marshalls, were, crushed, the, strategy, of, holding, overextended, island, garrisons, was, fully, exposed, in, february, 1944, the, us, navy, s, fast, carrier, task, force, during, operation, hailstone, attacked, the, major, naval, base, of, truk, although, the, japanese, had, moved, their, major, vessels, out, in, time, to, avoid, being, caught, at, anchor, in, the, atoll, two, days, of, air, attacks, resulted, in, significant, losses, to, japanese, aircraft, and, merchant, shipping, the, japanese, were, forced, to, abandon, truk, and, were, now, unable, to, counter, the, americans, on, any, front, on, the, perimeter, consequently, the, japanese, retained, their, remaining, strength, for, what, they, hoped, would, be, a, decisive, battle, the, japanese, then, developed, a, new, plan, known, as, a, go, a, decisive, fleet, action, that, would, be, fought, somewhere, from, the, palaus, to, the, western, carolines, it, was, in, this, area, that, the, newly, formed, mobile, fleet, along, with, large, numbers, of, land, based, aircraft, would, be, concentrated, if, the, americans, attacked, the, marianas, they, would, be, attacked, by, land, based, planes, in, the, vicinity, then, the, americans, would, be, lured, into, the, areas, where, the, mobile, fleet, could, defeat, them, on, 12, march, 1944, the, joint, chiefs, of, staff, directed, the, occupation, of, the, northern, marianas, with, a, target, date, of, 15, june, all, forces, for, the, marianas, operation, 535, warships, and, auxiliaries, together, with, a, ground, force, of, over, 127, 500, troops, were, to, be, commanded, by, admiral, raymond, a, spruance, for, the, americans, the, marianas, operation, would, provide, the, interruption, of, the, japanese, air, pipeline, to, the, south, the, development, of, advanced, naval, bases, the, establishment, of, airfields, to, base, b, 29s, from, which, to, bomb, japan, and, the, choice, among, several, possible, objectives, for, the, next, phase, of, operations, which, would, keep, the, japanese, uncertain, it, was, also, hoped, that, this, penetration, of, the, japanese, inner, defense, zone, might, force, the, japanese, fleet, out, for, a, decisive, engagement, the, ability, to, plan, and, execute, such, a, complex, operation, in, the, space, of, 90, days, was, indicative, of, allied, logistical, superiority, on, 15, june, the, 2nd, and, 4th, marine, divisions, supported, by, a, naval, bombardment, group, landed, on, saipan, however, japanese, fire, was, so, effective, that, the, first, day, s, objective, was, not, reached, until, day, 3, after, fanatic, japanese, resistance, the, marines, captured, aslito, airfield, on, 18, june, nafutan, saipan, s, southern, point, was, secured, on, 27, june, in, the, north, mount, tapotchau, the, highest, point, on, the, island, was, taken, on, 27, june, the, marines, then, steadily, advanced, northward, on, the, night, of, 6, 7, july, a, banzai, attack, took, place, in, which, three, to, four, thousand, japanese, made, a, fanatical, charge, that, penetrated, the, lines, near, tanapag, before, being, wiped, out, following, this, attack, hundreds, of, locals, committed, mass, suicide, on, 9, july, organized, resistance, on, saipan, ceased, the, us, marines, reached, northernmost, tip, of, saipan, marpi, point, twenty, four, days, after, the, landing, only, isolated, groups, of, hidden, japanese, troops, remained, a, month, after, the, invasion, of, saipan, the, us, recaptured, guam, and, captured, tinian, saipan, and, tinian, were, used, extensively, by, the, us, military, as, they, finally, put, mainland, japan, within, round, trip, range, of, american, b, 29s, japanese, forces, attacked, the, bases, on, saipan, and, tinian, from, november, 1944, to, january, 1945, the, united, states, army, air, forces, based, out, of, these, islands, conducted, an, intense, strategic, bombing, campaign, against, japanese, cities, of, military, and, industrial, importance, including, tokyo, nagoya, osaka, and, kobe, the, invasion, of, peleliu, in, the, palau, islands, on, 15, september, was, notable, for, a, drastic, change, in, japanese, defensive, tactics, resulting, in, the, highest, casualty, rate, amongst, us, forces, in, an, amphibious, operation, during, the, pacific, war, instead, of, the, predicted, four, days, it, took, until, 27, november, to, secure, the, island, the, strategic, value, of, the, landings, is, still, contested, when, the, americans, landed, on, saipan, in, the, marianas, the, japanese, viewed, holding, saipan, as, imperative, consequently, they, responded, with, their, largest, carrier, force, of, the, war, the, nine, carrier, mobile, fleet, under, vice, admiral, jisabur, ozawa, supplemented, by, 500, land, based, aircraft, facing, them, was, the, us, fifth, fleet, under, admiral, raymond, a, spruance, 15, fleet, carriers, and, 956, aircraft, the, clash, was, the, largest, carrier, battle, in, history, on, 19, june, a, series, of, japanese, carrier, air, strikes, were, shattered, by, strong, american, defenses, the, result, was, later, dubbed, the, great, marianas, turkey, shoot, all, us, carriers, had, combat, information, centers, which, interpreted, the, flow, of, radar, data, and, radioed, interception, orders, to, the, combat, air, patrols, the, few, japanese, attackers, that, managed, to, reach, the, us, fleet, in, a, staggered, sequence, encountered, massive, anti, aircraft, fire, with, proximity, fuzes, only, one, american, warship, was, slightly, damaged, on, the, same, day, sh, kaku, was, hit, by, four, torpedoes, from, the, submarine, cavalla, and, sank, with, heavy, loss, of, life, the, taih, was, also, sunk, by, a, single, torpedo, from, the, submarine, albacore, the, next, day, the, japanese, carrier, force, was, subjected, to, an, american, carrier, air, attack, and, suffered, the, loss, of, the, carrier, hiy, the, four, japanese, air, strikes, involved, 373, carrier, aircraft, of, which, 130, returned, to, the, carriers, many, of, these, survivors, were, subsequently, lost, when, taih, and, sh, kaku, were, sunk, by, american, submarine, attacks, after, the, second, day, of, the, battle, losses, totaled, three, carriers, and, 445, aircrew, with, more, than, 433, carrier, aircraft, and, around, 200, land, based, aircraft, the, americans, lost, 130, aircraft, and, 76, aircrew, many, losses, due, to, aircraft, running, out, of, fuel, returning, to, their, carriers, at, night, although, the, defeat, at, the, philippine, sea, was, severe, in, terms, of, the, loss, of, the, three, fleet, carriers, its, more, significant, impact, was, the, loss, of, the, carrier, air, groups, the, japanese, had, spent, the, better, part, of, a, year, reconstituting, their, carrier, air, groups, and, the, americans, had, destroyed, 90, of, it, in, two, days, the, japanese, had, only, enough, pilots, left, to, form, the, air, group, for, one, of, their, light, carriers, the, mobile, fleet, returned, home, with, only, 35, aircraft, of, the, 430, with, which, it, had, begun, the, battle, ended, in, a, total, japanese, defeat, and, resulted, in, the, virtual, end, of, their, carrier, force, the, loss, at, the, philippine, sea, left, the, japanese, with, two, choices, an, all, out, offensive, or, allow, the, americans, to, cut, the, sea, lanes, between, japan, and, southeast, asia, thus, the, japanese, devised, a, plan, to, force, a, decisive, battle, by, utilizing, their, last, remaining, strength, the, firepower, of, its, heavy, cruisers, and, battleships, against, the, american, beachhead, at, leyte, the, japanese, planned, to, use, their, remaining, carriers, as, bait, to, lure, the, american, carriers, away, from, leyte, gulf, long, enough, for, the, heavy, warships, to, enter, and, to, destroy, any, american, ships, present, the, japanese, assembled, four, carriers, nine, battleships, 14, heavy, cruisers, seven, light, cruisers, and, 35, destroyers, they, split, into, three, forces, the, center, force, under, the, command, of, vice, admiral, takeo, kurita, which, included, the, battleships, yamato, and, musashi, the, northern, force, under, the, command, of, ozawa, which, had, four, carriers, and, two, battleships, partly, converted, to, carriers, and, the, southern, force, containing, one, group, under, the, command, of, sh, ji, nishimura, and, another, under, kiyohide, shima, the, center, force, would, pass, through, the, san, bernardino, strait, into, the, philippine, sea, turn, southwards, and, then, attack, the, landing, area, the, southern, force, would, strike, at, the, landing, area, through, the, surigao, strait, while, the, northern, force, would, lure, the, main, american, covering, forces, away, from, leyte, japanese, carriers, embarked, just, 108, aircraft, however, after, center, force, departed, from, brunei, bay, on, 23, october, two, american, submarines, attacked, it, resulting, in, the, loss, of, two, heavy, cruisers, with, another, crippled, after, entering, the, sibuyan, sea, on, 24, october, center, force, was, assaulted, by, american, carrier, aircraft, forcing, another, heavy, cruiser, to, retire, the, americans, then, sank, musashi, many, other, ships, of, center, force, were, attacked, but, continued, on, convinced, that, their, attacks, had, made, center, force, ineffective, the, american, carriers, headed, north, to, address, the, newly, detected, threat, of, the, japanese, carriers, of, ozawa, s, northern, force, on, the, night, of, 24, 25, october, the, southern, force, under, nishimura, attempted, to, enter, leyte, gulf, from, the, south, through, surigao, strait, where, an, american, australian, force, led, by, rear, admiral, jesse, oldendorf, ambushed, the, japanese, american, destroyers, and, naval, gunfire, destroyed, two, battleships, and, three, destroyers, with, only, a, single, japanese, destroyer, surviving, as, a, result, of, observing, radio, silence, shima, s, group, was, unable, to, coordinate, its, movements, with, nishimura, s, group, and, arrived, at, surigao, strait, in, the, middle, of, the, encounter, after, making, a, haphazard, torpedo, attack, shima, retreated, off, cape, enga, o, 500, miles, 800, km, north, of, leyte, gulf, the, americans, launched, over, 500, aircraft, sorties, at, the, northern, force, followed, by, a, surface, group, of, cruisers, and, destroyers, all, four, japanese, carriers, were, sunk, but, the, japanese, had, succeeded, in, drawing, the, american, carriers, away, from, leyte, gulf, on, 25, october, the, final, major, surface, action, fought, between, the, japanese, and, the, american, fleets, occurred, off, samar, when, center, force, fell, upon, a, group, of, american, escort, carriers, escorted, only, by, destroyers, and, destroyer, escorts, both, sides, were, surprised, but, the, outcome, looked, certain, since, the, japanese, had, four, battleships, six, heavy, cruisers, and, two, light, cruisers, leading, two, destroyer, squadrons, however, they, conducted, a, largely, indecisive, gunnery, duel, before, breaking, off, japanese, losses, were, extremely, heavy, with, four, carriers, three, battleships, six, heavy, cruisers, four, light, cruisers, and, eleven, destroyers, sunk, while, the, americans, lost, one, light, carrier, and, two, escort, carriers, two, destroyers, and, two, destroyer, escorts, the, battle, of, leyte, gulf, was, the, largest, naval, battle, of, world, war, ii, and, arguably, the, largest, naval, battle, in, history, for, the, japanese, the, defeat, at, leyte, gulf, was, catastrophic, its, navy, s, greatest, ever, loss, of, ships, and, men, in, combat, the, inevitable, liberation, of, the, philippines, also, meant, that, the, home, islands, would, be, virtually, cut, off, from, the, vital, resources, from, japan, s, occupied, territories, in, southeast, asia, on, 20, october, 1944, the, us, sixth, army, supported, by, naval, and, air, bombardment, landed, on, the, favorable, eastern, shore, of, leyte, north, of, mindanao, the, us, sixth, army, continued, its, advance, from, the, east, while, the, japanese, rushed, reinforcements, to, the, western, side, the, us, reinforced, the, sixth, army, successfully, but, the, us, fifth, air, force, devastated, japanese, attempts, to, resupply, in, torrential, rains, and, over, difficult, terrain, the, us, advance, continued, across, leyte, and, the, neighboring, island, of, samar, to, the, north, on, 7, december, us, army, units, landed, and, after, a, major, land, and, air, battle, cut, off, the, japanese, ability, to, reinforce, and, supply, leyte, although, fierce, fighting, continued, on, leyte, for, months, the, us, army, was, in, control, on, 15, december, 1944, landings, against, minimal, resistance, took, place, on, the, southern, beaches, of, the, island, of, mindoro, a, key, location, in, the, planned, lingayen, gulf, operations, in, support, of, major, landings, scheduled, on, luzon, on, 9, january, 1945, general, krueger, s, sixth, army, landed, its, first, units, on, the, western, coast, of, luzon, almost, 175, 000, men, followed, within, a, few, days, with, heavy, air, support, army, units, pushed, inland, taking, clark, field, 40, miles, 64, km, northwest, of, manila, in, the, last, week, of, january, two, more, major, landings, followed, one, to, cut, off, the, bataan, peninsula, and, another, that, included, a, parachute, drop, south, of, manila, pincers, closed, on, the, city, and, on, 3, february, 1945, american, forces, pushed, into, manila, the, month, long, battle, for, manila, resulted, in, over, 100, 000, civilian, deaths, and, was, the, scene, of, the, worst, urban, fighting, by, american, forces, in, the, pacific, theater, as, the, advance, on, manila, continued, from, the, north, and, the, south, the, bataan, peninsula, was, rapidly, secured, on, 16, february, paratroopers, and, amphibious, units, assaulted, the, island, fortress, of, corregidor, and, resistance, ended, there, on, 27, february, in, all, ten, us, divisions, and, five, independent, regiments, battled, on, luzon, making, it, the, largest, campaign, of, the, pacific, war, involving, more, troops, than, the, us, had, used, in, north, africa, italy, or, southern, france, forces, included, the, mexican, escuadr, n, 201, fighter, squadron, as, part, of, the, fuerza, a, rea, expedicionaria, mexicana, with, the, squadron, attached, to, the, 58th, fighter, group, of, the, united, states, army, air, forces, that, flew, tactical, support, missions, of, the, 250, 000, japanese, troops, defending, luzon, 80, percent, died, the, last, japanese, soldier, in, the, philippines, hiroo, onoda, surrendered, on, 9, march, 1974, the, eighth, army, invaded, palawan, island, between, borneo, and, mindoro, the, fifth, largest, and, westernmost, philippine, island, on, 28, february, 1945, with, landings, at, puerto, princesa, the, japanese, put, up, little, direct, defense, of, palawan, but, cleaning, up, pockets, of, japanese, resistance, lasted, until, late, april, as, the, japanese, used, their, common, tactic, of, withdrawing, into, the, mountain, jungles, dispersed, as, small, units, throughout, the, philippines, filipino, guerrillas, aided, us, forces, to, dispatch, the, holdouts, the, us, eighth, army, moved, on, to, its, first, landing, on, mindanao, 17, april, the, last, of, the, major, philippine,

fifth, and, thirteenth, air, forces, to, attack, targets, throughout, the, philippines, and, the, south, china, sea, in, late, 1944, and, early, 1945, the, allied, south, east, asia, command, launched, offensives, into, burma, intending, to, recover, most, of, the, country, including, rangoon, the, capital, before, the, onset, of, the, monsoon, in, may, the, offensives, were, fought, primarily, by, british, commonwealth, chinese, and, american, forces, against, japan, assisted, to, some, degree, by, thailand, the, burma, national, army, and, the, indian, national, army, the, commonwealth, land, forces, were, drawn, primarily, from, the, united, kingdom, british, india, and, africa, the, indian, xv, corps, including, two, west, african, divisions, advanced, along, the, coast, in, arakan, province, at, last, capturing, akyab, island, they, landed, troops, behind, the, retreating, japanese, inflicting, heavy, casualties, and, captured, ramree, island, and, cheduba, island, establishing, airfields, used, to, support, the, offensive, into, central, burma, the, chinese, expeditionary, force, captured, mong, yu, and, lashio, while, the, chinese, and, american, northern, combat, area, command, resumed, its, advance, in, northern, burma, in, late, january, 1945, these, two, forces, linked, up, at, hsipaw, the, ledo, road, was, completed, linking, india, and, china, but, too, late, in, the, war, to, have, any, significant, effect, the, japanese, burma, area, army, attempted, to, forestall, the, main, allied, attack, by, withdrawing, their, troops, behind, the, irrawaddy, river, lieutenant, general, heitar, kimura, the, new, japanese, commander, in, burma, hoped, that, the, allies, lines, of, communications, would, be, overstretched, trying, to, cross, this, obstacle, however, the, advancing, british, fourteenth, army, switched, its, axis, of, advance, to, outflank, the, japanese, during, february, the, fourteenth, army, secured, bridgeheads, across, the, irrawaddy, on, 1, march, mechanised, units, of, iv, corps, captured, the, supply, centre, of, meiktila, throwing, the, japanese, into, disarray, while, the, japanese, attempted, to, recapture, meiktila, xxxiii, corps, captured, mandalay, the, japanese, armies, were, heavily, defeated, and, with, the, capture, of, mandalay, the, burmese, population, and, the, burma, national, army, which, the, japanese, had, raised, turned, against, the, japanese, during, april, fourteenth, army, advanced, 300, miles, 480, km, south, towards, rangoon, but, was, delayed, by, japanese, rearguards, 40, miles, 64, km, to, the, north, slim, feared, that, the, japanese, would, defend, rangoon, house, to, house, during, the, monsoon, which, would, commit, his, army, to, prolonged, action, with, disastrously, inadequate, supplies, and, in, march, he, had, asked, that, a, plan, to, capture, rangoon, by, an, amphibious, force, operation, dracula, which, had, been, abandoned, earlier, be, reinstated, dracula, was, launched, on, 1, may, to, find, that, the, japanese, had, already, evacuated, the, troops, that, occupied, rangoon, linked, up, with, fourteenth, army, five, days, later, securing, the, allies, lines, of, communication, the, japanese, forces, which, had, been, bypassed, by, the, allied, advances, attempted, to, break, out, across, the, sittaung, river, during, june, and, july, to, rejoin, the, burma, area, army, which, had, regrouped, in, tenasserim, in, southern, burma, they, suffered, 14, 000, casualties, half, their, strength, overall, the, japanese, lost, some, 150, 000, men, in, burma, only, 1, 700, japanese, soldiers, surrendered, and, were, taken, prisoner, the, allies, were, preparing, to, make, amphibious, landings, in, malaya, when, word, of, the, japanese, surrender, arrived, although, the, marianas, were, secure, and, american, bases, firmly, established, the, long, 1, 200, miles, 1, 900, km, range, from, the, marianas, meant, that, b, 29, aircrews, bombing, japan, found, themselves, ditching, at, sea, if, severely, damaged, attention, focused, on, the, small, island, of, iwo, jima, about, halfway, between, the, marianas, and, japan, american, planners, recognized, the, strategic, importance, of, the, island, the, island, was, used, by, the, japanese, as, an, early, warning, station, against, impending, air, raids, on, japanese, cities, japanese, aircraft, based, on, iwo, jima, were, able, to, attack, the, b, 29s, on, their, bombing, missions, and, even, to, attack, installations, in, the, marianas, themselves, the, capture, of, iwo, jima, would, provide, emergency, landing, airfields, for, b, 29s, and, a, base, for, p, 51, fighter, escorts, as, well, as, land, based, air, support, to, protect, us, naval, fleets, in, japanese, waters, however, the, japanese, had, also, come, to, realize, the, strategic, value, of, iwo, jima, and, lt, general, tadamichi, kuribayashi, was, assigned, command, of, the, island, in, may, 1944, the, japanese, began, constructing, elaborate, defenses, making, the, best, possible, use, of, the, island, s, natural, caves, and, uneven, rocky, terrain, the, island, was, transformed, into, a, massive, network, of, bunkers, hidden, guns, and, underground, passageways, leading, from, one, strong, point, to, another, the, japanese, also, went, to, great, lengths, to, construct, large, underground, chambers, some, as, much, as, five, stories, deep, to, serve, as, storage, and, hospital, areas, with, thick, walls, and, ceilings, of, reinforced, concrete, a, series, of, strong, points, covering, the, landing, areas, were, also, built, most, covered, with, sand, and, carefully, camouflaged, well, camouflaged, 120mm, and, 6, inch, guns, were, emplaced, so, that, their, fire, could, be, directed, to, the, beaches, smaller, caliber, artillery, antiaircraft, guns, and, mortars, were, also, hidden, and, located, where, only, a, direct, hit, could, destroy, them, the, japanese, were, determined, to, make, the, americans, pay, a, high, price, for, iwo, jima, and, were, prepared, to, defend, it, to, the, death, kuribayashi, knew, that, he, could, not, win, the, battle, but, hoped, to, inflict, severe, casualties, so, costly, that, it, would, slow, the, american, advance, on, japan, and, maybe, give, the, japanese, bargaining, power, in, february, a, total, of, 21, 000, japanese, troops, were, deployed, on, iwo, jima, the, american, operation, operation, detachment, to, capture, the, island, involved, three, marine, divisions, of, the, v, amphibious, corps, a, total, of, 70, 647, troops, under, the, command, of, holland, smith, from, mid, june, 1944, iwo, jima, came, under, american, air, and, naval, bombardment, until, the, days, leading, up, to, the, invasion, an, intense, naval, and, air, bombardment, preceded, the, landing, but, did, little, but, drive, the, japanese, further, underground, making, their, positions, impervious, to, enemy, fire, the, hidden, guns, and, defenses, survived, the, bombardment, virtually, unscathed, on, the, morning, of, 19, february, 1945, 30, 000, men, under, the, command, of, maj, general, harry, schmidt, landed, on, the, southeast, coast, near, mt, suribachi, where, most, of, the, island, s, defenses, were, concentrated, as, soon, as, the, marines, pushed, inland, they, came, under, devastating, machine, gun, and, artillery, fire, by, the, end, of, the, day, the, marines, reached, the, west, coast, but, their, losses, were, severe, almost, 2, 000, men, killed, or, wounded, on, 23, february, the, 28th, marine, regiment, reached, the, summit, of, mt, suribachi, prompting, the, now, famous, raising, the, flag, on, iwo, jima, photograph, often, cited, as, the, most, reproduced, photograph, ever, and, the, archetypal, representation, of, the, pacific, war, for, the, rest, of, february, the, americans, pushed, north, and, by, 1, march, had, taken, two, thirds, of, the, island, it, was, not, until, 26, march, that, the, island, was, secured, iwo, jima, was, one, of, the, bloodiest, battles, fought, by, the, americans, during, the, pacific, war, american, casualties, were, 6, 821, killed, and, 19, 207, wounded, the, japanese, losses, totaled, well, over, 20, 000, men, killed, with, only, 1, 083, prisoners, taken, historians, debate, whether, it, was, strategically, worth, the, casualties, sustained, the, largest, and, bloodiest, battle, fought, by, the, americans, against, the, japanese, came, at, okinawa, the, seizure, of, islands, in, the, ryukyus, was, to, have, been, the, last, step, before, the, actual, invasion, of, the, japanese, home, islands, okinawa, the, largest, of, the, ryukyu, islands, was, located, 340, miles, 550, km, from, kyushu, the, capture, of, okinawa, would, provide, airbases, to, intensify, aerial, bombardment, of, japan, and, for, direct, land, based, air, support, of, the, invasion, of, kyushu, the, islands, could, also, allow, for, tightening, the, blockade, of, japanese, shipping, and, be, used, as, a, staging, area, and, supply, base, for, any, invasion, of, the, home, islands, the, japanese, troops, defending, okinawa, under, the, command, of, lieutenant, general, mitsuru, ushijima, totaled, some, 75, 000, 100, 000, augmented, by, thousands, of, civilians, american, forces, for, the, operation, totaled, 183, 000, troops, in, seven, divisions, four, us, army, and, three, marine, under, the, tenth, army, the, british, pacific, fleet, operated, as, a, separate, unit, its, objective, was, to, strike, airfields, on, the, chain, of, islands, between, formosa, and, okinawa, to, prevent, the, japanese, reinforcing, okinawa, after, an, intense, seven, day, bombardment, the, main, landings, on, okinawa, took, place, on, 1, april, 1945, on, the, hagushi, beaches, of, the, island, s, west, coast, however, there, was, little, opposition, at, the, beaches, as, the, japanese, had, decided, to, meet, the, americans, farther, inland, out, of, range, of, naval, gunfire, about, 60, 000, american, troops, landed, on, the, first, day, seizing, the, two, nearby, airfields, and, pushing, across, the, narrow, waist, of, the, island, the, first, major, japanese, counterattack, occurred, on, 6, and, 7, april, in, the, form, of, attacks, by, kamikaze, aircraft, and, a, naval, operation, called, ten, go, under, the, command, of, admiral, seiichi, it, the, battleship, yamato, the, light, cruiser, yahagi, and, eight, destroyers, were, assembled, as, bait, to, draw, away, as, many, american, carrier, aircraft, as, possible, in, order, to, leave, allied, naval, forces, vulnerable, to, large, scale, kamikaze, attacks, as, a, consequence, of, japanese, fuel, shortages, the, yamato, had, only, enough, to, reach, okinawa, off, okinawa, it, was, planned, to, beach, the, battleship, and, use, her, 18, 1, inch, 46, cm, guns, to, support, fighting, on, the, island, after, being, sighted, by, an, american, submarine, and, reconnaissance, aircraft, naval, attack, aircraft, sunk, the, yamato, yahagi, and, four, of, the, destroyers, mass, kamikaze, attacks, intensified, during, the, following, three, months, with, 5, 500, sorties, being, flown, by, the, japanese, in, the, northern, part, of, okinawa, american, troops, only, met, light, opposition, and, the, area, was, seized, within, about, two, weeks, however, the, main, japanese, defenses, were, in, the, south, there, was, bitter, fighting, against, well, entrenched, japanese, troops, but, us, forces, slowly, made, progress, the, seizure, of, shuri, castle, the, center, of, japanese, resistance, on, 29, may, represented, both, a, strategic, and, psychological, blow, organized, resistance, was, not, over, until, 21, june, many, japanese, went, into, hiding, and, the, campaign, was, not, declared, over, until, 2, july, the, battle, for, okinawa, proved, costly, and, lasted, much, longer, than, the, americans, had, expected, the, japanese, skillfully, utilized, terrain, to, inflict, maximum, casualties, total, american, casualties, were, 49, 451, including, 12, 520, dead, or, missing, and, 36, 631, wounded, japanese, casualties, were, approximately, 110, 000, killed, and, 7, 400, taken, prisoner, 94, of, the, japanese, soldiers, died, along, with, many, civilians, kamikaze, attacks, also, sank, 36, ships, damaged, 368, more, and, killed, 4, 900, us, sailors, for, the, loss, of, 7, 800, japanese, aircraft, after, japanese, victories, in, operation, ichi, go, japan, was, losing, the, battle, in, burma, and, facing, constant, attacks, from, chinese, nationalist, forces, and, communist, guerrillas, in, the, countryside, the, ija, began, preparations, for, the, battle, of, west, hunan, in, march, 1945, mobilizing, 80, 000, men, to, seize, chinese, airfields, and, secure, railroads, in, west, hunan, by, early, april, in, response, the, chinese, national, military, council, dispatched, the, 4th, front, army, and, the, 10th, and, 27th, army, groups, with, he, yingqin, as, commander, in, chief, at, the, same, time, it, airlifted, the, entire, chinese, new, 6th, corps, an, american, equipped, corps, and, veterans, of, the, burma, expeditionary, force, from, kunming, to, zhijiang, chinese, forces, totaled, 110, 000, men, supported, by, about, 400, aircraft, from, chinese, and, american, air, forces, chinese, forces, won, decisively, and, launched, a, large, counterattack, in, this, campaign, concurrently, the, chinese, repelled, a, japanese, offensive, in, henan, and, hubei, afterwards, chinese, forces, retook, hunan, and, hubei, in, south, china, chinese, launched, a, counter, offensive, to, retake, guangxi, which, was, the, last, major, japanese, stronghold, in, south, china, in, august, 1945, chinese, forces, retook, guangxi, the, borneo, campaign, of, 1945, was, the, last, major, campaign, in, the, south, west, pacific, area, in, a, series, of, amphibious, assaults, between, 1, may, and, 21, july, the, australian, i, corps, under, general, leslie, morshead, attacked, japanese, forces, occupying, the, island, allied, naval, and, air, forces, centered, on, the, us, 7th, fleet, under, admiral, thomas, kinkaid, the, australian, first, tactical, air, force, and, the, us, thirteenth, air, force, also, played, important, roles, in, the, campaign, the, campaign, opened, with, a, landing, on, the, small, island, of, tarakan, on, 1, may, this, was, followed, on, 1, june, by, simultaneous, assaults, in, the, northwest, on, the, island, of, labuan, and, the, coast, of, brunei, a, week, later, the, australians, attacked, japanese, positions, in, north, borneo, the, attention, of, the, allies, then, switched, back, to, the, central, east, coast, with, the, last, major, amphibious, assault, of, world, war, ii, at, balikpapan, on, 1, july, although, the, campaign, was, criticized, in, australia, as, a, waste, of, the, lives, of, soldiers, it, achieved, a, number, of, objectives, such, as, increasing, the, isolation, of, significant, japanese, forces, occupying, the, dutch, east, indies, capturing, major, oil, supplies, and, freeing, allied, prisoners, of, war, who, were, being, held, in, deteriorating, conditions, at, one, of, the, very, worst, sites, around, sandakan, in, borneo, only, six, of, 2, 500, british, and, australian, prisoners, survived, hard, fought, battles, on, the, japanese, islands, of, iwo, jima, okinawa, and, others, resulted, in, horrific, casualties, on, both, sides, but, finally, produced, a, japanese, defeat, of, the, 117, 000, okinawan, and, japanese, troops, defending, okinawa, 94, percent, died, faced, with, the, loss, of, most, of, their, experienced, pilots, the, japanese, increased, their, use, of, kamikaze, tactics, in, an, attempt, to, create, unacceptably, high, casualties, for, the, allies, the, us, navy, proposed, to, force, a, japanese, surrender, through, a, total, naval, blockade, and, air, raids, many, military, historians, believe, that, the, okinawa, campaign, led, directly, to, the, atomic, bombings, as, a, means, of, avoiding, the, ground, invasion, of, japan, this, view, is, explained, by, victor, davis, hanson, because, the, japanese, on, okinawa, were, so, fierce, in, their, defense, even, when, cut, off, and, without, supplies, and, because, casualties, were, so, appalling, many, american, strategists, looked, for, an, alternative, means, to, subdue, mainland, japan, other, than, a, direct, invasion, this, means, presented, itself, with, the, advent, of, atomic, bombs, which, worked, admirably, in, convincing, the, japanese, to, sue, for, peace, without, american, casualties, towards, the, end, of, the, war, as, strategic, bombing, became, more, important, a, new, command, for, the, united, states, strategic, air, forces, in, the, pacific, was, created, to, oversee, all, us, strategic, bombing, in, the, hemisphere, under, general, curtis, lemay, japanese, industrial, production, plunged, as, nearly, half, of, the, built, up, areas, of, 67, cities, were, destroyed, by, b, 29, firebombing, raids, on, 9, 10, march, 1945, lemay, oversaw, operation, meetinghouse, in, which, 300, b, 29s, dropped, 1, 665, tons, of, bombs, mostly, napalm, carrying, m, 69, incendiary, bombs, on, the, japanese, capital, this, attack, is, seen, the, most, destructive, bombing, raid, in, history, and, killed, between, 80, 000, and, 100, 000, people, in, a, single, night, destroying, over, 270, 000, buildings, and, leaving, over, 1, million, homeless, in, the, ten, days, that, followed, almost, 10, 000, bombs, were, dropped, destroying, 31, of, tokyo, nagoya, osaka, and, kobe, lemay, also, oversaw, operation, starvation, in, which, the, inland, waterways, of, japan, were, extensively, mined, by, air, which, disrupted, the, little, remaining, japanese, coastal, sea, traffic, on, 26, july, 1945, us, president, harry, s, truman, chiang, and, churchill, issued, the, potsdam, declaration, which, outlined, the, terms, of, surrender, for, japan, as, agreed, upon, at, the, potsdam, conference, this, ultimatum, stated, that, if, japan, did, not, surrender, it, would, face, prompt, and, utter, destruction, on, 6, august, 1945, the, us, dropped, an, atomic, bomb, on, the, japanese, city, of, hiroshima, in, the, first, nuclear, attack, in, history, in, a, press, release, issued, after, the, bombing, truman, warned, japan, to, surrender, or, expect, a, rain, of, ruin, from, the, air, the, like, of, which, has, never, been, seen, on, this, earth, on, 9, august, the, us, dropped, another, atomic, bomb, on, nagasaki, more, than, 140, 000, 240, 000, people, died, as, a, direct, result, of, these, two, bombings, the, necessity, of, the, atomic, bombings, has, long, been, debated, with, detractors, claiming, that, a, naval, blockade, and, incendiary, bombing, campaign, had, already, made, invasion, hence, the, atomic, bomb, unnecessary, however, other, scholars, have, argued, that, the, atomic, bombings, shocked, the, japanese, government, into, surrender, and, helped, avoid, operation, downfall, or, a, prolonged, blockade, and, conventional, bombing, campaign, any, of, which, would, have, exacted, much, higher, casualties, among, japanese, civilians, historian, richard, b, frank, wrote, that, a, soviet, invasion, of, japan, was, never, likely, because, they, had, insufficient, naval, capability, in, february, 1945, during, the, yalta, conference, the, soviet, union, had, agreed, to, enter, the, war, against, japan, 90, days, after, the, surrender, of, germany, at, the, time, soviet, participation, was, seen, as, crucial, to, tie, down, the, large, number, of, japanese, forces, in, manchuria, and, korea, keeping, them, from, being, transferred, to, the, home, islands, to, mount, a, defense, to, an, invasion, on, 9, august, exactly, on, schedule, the, soviet, union, entered, the, war, by, invading, manchuria, a, battle, hardened, one, million, strong, soviet, force, transferred, from, europe, attacked, japanese, forces, and, landed, a, heavy, blow, against, the, japanese, kant, gun, kwantung, army, the, manchurian, strategic, offensive, operation, began, on, 9, august, 1945, with, the, soviet, invasion, of, the, japanese, puppet, state, of, manchukuo, this, was, the, last, campaign, of, the, second, world, war, and, the, largest, of, the, 1945, soviet, japanese, war, which, resumed, hostilities, between, the, ussr, and, japan, after, almost, six, years, of, peace, soviet, gains, on, the, continent, were, manchukuo, mengjiang, inner, mongolia, and, northern, korea, the, ussr, s, entry, into, the, war, was, a, significant, factor, in, the, japanese, decision, to, surrender, as, it, became, apparent, the, soviets, were, no, longer, willing, to, act, as, an, intermediary, for, a, negotiated, settlement, on, favorable, terms, in, late, 1945, the, soviets, launched, a, series, of, successful, invasions, of, northern, japanese, territories, in, preparation, for, the, possible, invasion, of, hokkaido, the, effects, of, the, american, air, and, naval, attacks, two, atomic, bombings, and, the, soviet, entry, were, profound, on, 10, august, 1945, japanese, prime, minister, kantar, suzuki, and, his, cabinet, decided, to, accept, the, potsdam, terms, on, one, condition, the, prerogative, of, his, majesty, as, a, sovereign, ruler, at, noon, on, 15, august, after, the, american, government, s, intentionally, ambiguous, reply, stating, that, the, authority, of, the, emperor, shall, be, subject, to, the, supreme, commander, of, the, allied, powers, the, emperor, hirohito, broadcast, the, rescript, of, surrender, should, we, continue, to, fight, it, would, not, only, result, in, an, ultimate, collapse, and, obliteration, of, the, japanese, nation, but, also, it, would, lead, to, the, total, extinction, of, human, civilization, in, japan, 14, august, is, considered, the, end, of, the, pacific, war, however, as, imperial, japan, actually, surrendered, on, 15, august, this, day, became, known, in, the, english, speaking, countries, as, v, j, day, victory, in, japan, the, formal, japanese, instrument, of, surrender, was, signed, on, 2, september, 1945, the, surrender, was, accepted, by, macarthur, as, supreme, commander, of, the, allied, powers, macarthur, then, went, to, tokyo, to, oversee, the, occupation, of, japan, from, 28, august, 1945, to, 28, april, 1952, the, treaty, of, san, francisco, came, into, force, american, casualties, were, 107, 903, battle, deaths, and, 208, 333, wounded, the, figure, for, battle, deaths, include, army, prisoners, who, died, in, japanese, captivity, this, is, the, standard, itemization, of, for, us, deaths, in, the, pacific, war, however, historian, john, w, dower, notes, that, there, are, inconsistencies, within, the, official, us, statistics, themselves, the, total, number, of, dead, in, pacific, theaters, rises, to, 113, 079, if, army, non, battle, deaths, are, included, over, half, of, all, american, losses, suffered, in, the, pacific, occurred, between, july, 1944, and, july, 1945, combined, the, us, and, allied, navies, lost, nearly, 200, warships, including, 4, battleships, 12, aircraft, carriers, 25, cruisers, 84, destroyers, and, destroyer, escorts, 63, submarines, and, nearly, 30, 000, aircraft, this, gave, the, allies, a, 2, 1, exchange, ratio, with, the, japanese, in, terms, of, ships, and, aircraft, the, us, protectorate, in, the,
