the, region, was, sometimes, called, the, indian, empire, though, not, officially, this, system, of, governance, was, instituted, on, 28, june, 1858, when, after, the, indian, rebellion, of, 1857, the, rule, of, the, east, india, company, was, transferred, to, the, crown, in, the, person, of, queen, victoria, who, in, 1876, was, proclaimed, empress, of, india, it, lasted, until, 1947, when, the, british, raj, was, partitioned, into, two, sovereign, dominion, states, the, union, of, india, later, the, republic, of, india, and, pakistan, later, the, islamic, republic, of, pakistan, later,

1945, india, was, a, participating, state, in, the, summer, olympics, in, 1900, 1920, 1928, 1932, and, 1936, the, british, raj, extended, over, almost, all, present, day, india, pakistan, bangladesh, and, myanmar, except, for, small, holdings, by, other, european, nations, such, as, goa, and, pondicherry, this, area, is, very, diverse, containing, the, himalayan, mountains, fertile, floodplains, the, indo, gangetic, plain, a, long, coastline, tropical, dry, forests, arid, uplands, and, the, thar, desert, in, addition, at, various, times, it, included, aden, from, 1858, to, 1937, lower, burma, from, 1858, to, 1937, upper, burma, from, 1886, to, 1937, british, somaliland, briefly, from, 1884, to, 1898, and, the, straits, settlements, briefly, from, 1858, to, 1867, burma, was, separated,

persian, gulf, residency, were, theoretically, princely, states, as, well, as, presidencies, and, provinces, of, british, india, until, 1947, and, used, the, rupee, as, their, unit, of, currency, among, other, countries, in, the, region, ceylon, which, was, referred, to, coastal, regions, and, northern, part, of, the, island, at, that, time, now, sri, lanka, was, ceded, to, britain, in, 1802, under, the, treaty, of, amiens, these, coastal, regions, were, temporarily, administered, under, madras, presidency, between, 1793, and, 1798, but, for, later, periods, the, british, governors, reported, to, london, and, it, was, not, part, of, the, raj, the, kingdoms, of, nepal, and, bhutan, having, fought, wars, with, the, british, subsequently, signed, treaties, with, them, and, were, recognised, by, the, british, as, independent, states, the, kingdom, of, sikkim, was, established, as, a, princely, state, after, the, anglo, sikkimese, treaty, of, 1861, however, the, issue, of, sovereignty, was, left, undefined, the, maldive, islands, were, a, british, protectorate, from, 1887, to, 1965, but, not, part, of, british, india, although, the, indian, rebellion, of, 1857, had, shaken, the, british, enterprise, in, india, it, had, not, derailed, it, until, 1857, the, british, especially, under, lord, dalhousie, had, been, hurriedly, building, an, india, which, they, envisaged, to, be, on, par, with, britain, itself, in, the, quality, and, strength, of, its, economic, and, social, institutions, after, the, rebellion, they, became, more, circumspect, much, thought, was, devoted, to, the, causes, of, the, rebellion, and, three, main, lessons, were, drawn, first, at, a, practical, level, it, was, felt, that, there, needed, to, be, more, communication, and, camaraderie, between, the, british, and, indians, not, just, between, british, army, officers, and, their, indian, staff, but, in, civilian, life, as, well, the, indian, army, was, completely, reorganised, units, composed, of, the, muslims, and, brahmins, of, the, united, provinces, of, agra, and, oudh, who, had, formed, the, core, of, the, rebellion, were, disbanded, new, regiments, like, the, sikhs, and, baluchis, composed, of, indians, who, in, british, estimation, had, demonstrated, steadfastness, were, formed, from, then, on, the, indian, army, was, to, remain, unchanged, in, its, organisation, until, 1947, the, 1861, census, had, revealed, that, the, english, population, in, india, was, 125, 945, of, these, only, about, 41, 862, were, civilians, as, compared, with, about, 84, 083, european, officers, and, men, of, the, army, in, 1880, the, standing, indian, army, consisted, of, 66, 000, british, soldiers, 130, 000, natives, and, 350, 000, soldiers, in, the, princely, armies, second, it, was, also, felt, that, both, the, princes, and, the, large, land, holders, by, not, joining, the, rebellion, had, proved, to, be, in, lord, canning, s, words, breakwaters, in, a, storm, they, too, were, rewarded, in, the, new, british, raj, by, being, integrated, into, the, british, indian, political, system, and, having, their, territories, guaranteed, at, the, same, time, it, was, felt, that, the, peasants, for, whose, benefit, the, large, land, reforms, of, the, united, provinces, had, been, undertaken, had, shown, disloyalty, by, in, many, cases, fighting, for, their, former, landlords, against, the, british, consequently, no, more, land, reforms, were, implemented, for, the, next, 90, years, bengal, and, bihar, were, to, remain, the, realms, of, large, land, holdings, unlike, the, punjab, and, uttar, pradesh, third, the, british, felt, disenchanted, with, indian, reaction, to, social, change, until, the, rebellion, they, had, enthusiastically, pushed, through, social, reform, like, the, ban, on, sati, by, lord, william, bentinck, it, was, now, felt, that, traditions, and, customs, in, india, were, too, strong, and, too, rigid, to, be, changed, easily, consequently, no, more, british, social, interventions, were, made, especially, in, matters, dealing, with, religion, even, when, the, british, felt, very, strongly, about, the, issue, as, in, the, instance, of, the, remarriage, of, hindu, child, widows, this, was, exemplified, further, in, queen, victoria, s, proclamation, released, immediately, after, the, rebellion, the, proclamation, stated, that, we, disclaim, alike, our, right, and, desire, to, impose, our, convictions, on, any, of, our, subjects, demonstrating, official, british, commitment, to, abstaining, from, social, intervention, in, india, in, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, both, the, direct, administration, of, india, by, the, british, crown, and, the, technological, change, ushered, in, by, the, industrial, revolution, had, the, effect, of, closely, intertwining, the, economies, of, india, and, great, britain, in, fact, many, of, the, major, changes, in, transport, and, communications, that, are, typically, associated, with, crown, rule, of, india, had, already, begun, before, the, mutiny, since, dalhousie, had, embraced, the, technological, change, then, rampant, in, great, britain, india, too, saw, the, rapid, development, of, all, those, technologies, railways, roads, canals, and, bridges, were, rapidly, built, in, india, and, telegraph, links, were, equally, rapidly, established, so, that, raw, materials, such, as, cotton, from, india, s, hinterland, could, be, transported, more, efficiently, to, ports, such, as, bombay, for, subsequent, export, to, england, likewise, finished, goods, from, england, were, transported, back, for, sale, in, the, burgeoning, indian, markets, unlike, britain, where, the, market, risks, for, the, infrastructure, development, were, borne, by, private, investors, in, india, it, was, the, taxpayers, primarily, farmers, and, farm, labourers, who, endured, the, risks, which, in, the, end, amounted, to, 50, million, despite, these, costs, very, little, skilled, employment, was, created, for, indians, by, 1920, with, the, fourth, largest, railway, network, in, the, world, and, a, history, of, 60, years, of, its, construction, only, ten, per, cent, of, the, superior, posts, in, the, indian, railways, were, held, by, indians, the, rush, of, technology, was, also, changing, the, agricultural, economy, in, india, by, the, last, decade, of, the, 19th, century, a, large, fraction, of, some, raw, materials, not, only, cotton, but, also, some, food, grains, were, being, exported, to, faraway, markets, many, small, farmers, dependent, on, the, whims, of, those, markets, lost, land, animals, and, equipment, to, money, lenders, the, latter, half, of, the, 19th, century, also, saw, an, increase, in, the, number, of, large, scale, famines, in, india, although, famines, were, not, new, to, the, subcontinent, these, were, particularly, severe, with, tens, of, millions, dying, and, with, many, critics, both, british, and, indian, laying, the, blame, at, the, doorsteps, of, the, lumbering, colonial, administrations, there, were, also, salutary, effects, commercial, cropping, especially, in, the, newly, canalled, punjab, led, to, increased, food, production, for, internal, consumption, the, railway, network, provided, critical, famine, relief, notably, reduced, the, cost, of, moving, goods, and, helped, nascent, indian, owned, industry, after, the, great, famine, of, 1876, 1878, the, indian, famine, commission, report, was, issued, in, 1880, and, the, indian, famine, codes, the, earliest, famine, scales, and, programmes, for, famine, prevention, were, instituted, in, one, form, or, other, they, would, be, implemented, worldwide, by, the, united, nations, and, the, food, and, agricultural, organisation, well, into, the, 1970s, by, 1880, a, new, middle, class, had, arisen, in, india, and, spread, thinly, across, the, country, moreover, there, was, a, growing, solidarity, among, its, members, created, by, the, joint, stimuli, of, encouragement, and, irritation, the, encouragement, felt, by, this, class, came, from, its, success, in, education, and, its, ability, to, avail, itself, of, the, benefits, of, that, education, such, as, employment, in, the, indian, civil, service, it, came, too, from, queen, victoria, s, proclamation, of, 1858, in, which, she, had, declared, we, hold, ourselves, bound, to, the, natives, of, our, indian, territories, by, the, same, obligation, of, duty, which, bind, us, to, all, our, other, subjects, indians, were, especially, encouraged, when, canada, was, granted, dominion, status, in, 1867, and, established, an, autonomous, democratic, constitution, lastly, the, encouragement, came, from, the, work, of, contemporaneous, oriental, scholars, like, monier, monier, williams, and, max, m, ller, who, in, their, works, had, been, presenting, ancient, india, as, a, great, civilisation, irritation, on, the, other, hand, came, not, just, from, incidents, of, racial, discrimination, at, the, hands, of, the, british, in, india, but, also, from, governmental, actions, like, the, use, of, indian, troops, in, imperial, campaigns, e, g, in, the, second, anglo, afghan, war, and, the, attempts, to, control, the, vernacular, press, e, g, in, the, vernacular, press, act, of, 1878, it, was, however, viceroy, lord, ripon, s, partial, reversal, of, the, ilbert, bill, 1883, a, legislative, measure, that, had, proposed, putting, indian, judges, in, the, bengal, presidency, on, equal, footing, with, british, ones, that, transformed, the, discontent, into, political, action, on, 28, december, 1885, professionals, and, intellectuals, from, this, middle, class, many, educated, at, the, new, british, founded, universities, in, bombay, calcutta, and, madras, and, familiar, with, the, ideas, of, british, political, philosophers, especially, the, utilitarians, assembled, in, bombay, founded, the, indian, national, congress, the, 70, men, elected, womesh, chunder, bonerjee, as, the, first, president, the, membership, consisted, of, a, westernised, elite, and, no, effort, was, made, at, this, time, to, broaden, the, base, during, its, first, 20, years, the, congress, primarily, debated, british, policy, toward, india, its, debates, created, a, new, indian, outlook, that, held, great, britain, responsible, for, draining, india, of, its, wealth, britain, did, this, the, nationalists, claimed, by, unfair, trade, by, the, restraint, on, indigenous, indian, industry, and, by, the, use, of, indian, taxes, to, pay, the, high, salaries, of, the, british, civil, servants, in, india, thomas, baring, served, as, viceroy, of, india, 1872, 1876, baring, s, major, accomplishments, came, as, an, energetic, reformer, who, was, dedicated, to, upgrading, the, quality, of, government, in, the, british, raj, he, began, large, scale, famine, relief, reduced, taxes, and, overcame, bureaucratic, obstacles, in, an, effort, to, reduce, both, starvation, and, widespread, social, unrest, although, appointed, by, a, liberal, government, his, policies, were, much, the, same, as, viceroys, appointed, by, conservative, governments, social, reform, was, in, the, air, by, the, 1880s, for, example, pandita, ramabai, poet, sanskrit, scholar, and, a, champion, of, the, emancipation, of, indian, women, took, up, the, cause, of, widow, remarriage, especially, of, brahmin, widows, later, converted, to, christianity, by, 1900, reform, movements, had, taken, root, within, the, indian, national, congress, congress, member, gopal, krishna, gokhale, founded, the, servants, of, india, society, which, lobbied, for, legislative, reform, for, example, for, a, law, to, permit, the, remarriage, of, hindu, child, widows, and, whose, members, took, vows, of, poverty, and, worked, among, the, untouchable, community, by, 1905, a, deep, gulf, opened, between, the, moderates, led, by, gokhale, who, downplayed, public, agitation, and, the, new, extremists, who, not, only, advocated, agitation, but, also, regarded, the, pursuit, of, social, reform, as, a, distraction, from, nationalism, prominent, among, the, extremists, was, bal, gangadhar, tilak, who, attempted, to, mobilise, indians, by, appealing, to, an, explicitly, hindu, political, identity, displayed, for, example, in, the, annual, public, ganapati, festivals, that, he, inaugurated, in, western, india, the, viceroy, lord, curzon, 1899, 1905, was, unusually, energetic, in, pursuit, of, efficiency, and, reform, his, agenda, included, the, creation, of, the, north, west, frontier, province, small, changes, in, the, civil, services, speeding, up, the, operations, of, the, secretariat, setting, up, a, gold, standard, to, ensure, a, stable, currency, creation, of, a, railway, board, irrigation, reform, reduction, of, peasant, debts, lowering, the, cost, of, telegrams, archaeological, research, and, the, preservation, of, antiquities, improvements, in, the, universities, police, reforms, upgrading, the, roles, of, the, native, states, a, new, commerce, and, industry, department, promotion, of, industry, revised, land, revenue, policies, lowering, taxes, setting, up, agricultural, banks, creating, an, agricultural, department, sponsoring, agricultural, research, establishing, an, imperial, library, creating, an, imperial, cadet, corps, new, famine, codes, and, indeed, reducing, the, smoke, nuisance, in, calcutta, trouble, emerged, for, curzon, when, he, divided, the, largest, administrative, subdivision, in, british, india, the, bengal, province, into, the, muslim, majority, province, of, eastern, bengal, and, assam, and, the, hindu, majority, province, of, west, bengal, present, day, indian, states, of, west, bengal, bihar, and, odisha, curzon, s, act, the, partition, of, bengal, had, been, contemplated, by, various, colonial, administrations, since, the, time, of, lord, william, bentinck, but, was, never, acted, upon, though, some, considered, it, administratively, felicitous, it, was, communally, charged, it, sowed, the, seeds, of, division, among, indians, in, bengal, transforming, nationalist, politics, as, nothing, else, before, it, the, hindu, elite, of, bengal, among, them, many, who, owned, land, in, east, bengal, that, was, leased, out, to, muslim, peasants, protested, fervidly, following, the, partition, of, bengal, which, was, a, strategy, set, out, by, lord, curzon, to, weaken, the, nationalist, movement, tilak, encouraged, the, swadeshi, movement, and, the, boycott, movement, the, movement, consisted, of, the, boycott, of, foreign, goods, and, also, the, social, boycott, of, any, indian, who, used, foreign, goods, the, swadeshi, movement, consisted, of, the, usage, of, natively, produced, goods, once, foreign, goods, were, boycotted, there, was, a, gap, which, had, to, be, filled, by, the, production, of, those, goods, in, india, itself, bal, gangadhar, tilak, said, that, the, swadeshi, and, boycott, movements, are, two, sides, of, the, same, coin, the, large, bengali, hindu, middle, class, the, bhadralok, upset, at, the, prospect, of, bengalis, being, outnumbered, in, the, new, bengal, province, by, biharis, and, oriyas, felt, that, curzon, s, act, was, punishment, for, their, political, assertiveness, the, pervasive, protests, against, curzon, s, decision, took, the, form, predominantly, of, the, swadeshi, buy, indian, campaign, led, by, two, time, congress, president, surendranath, banerjee, and, involved, boycott, of, british, goods, the, rallying, cry, for, both, types, of, protest, was, the, slogan, bande, mataram, hail, to, the, mother, which, invoked, a, mother, goddess, who, stood, variously, for, bengal, india, and, the, hindu, goddess, kali, sri, aurobindo, never, went, beyond, the, law, when, he, edited, the, bande, mataram, magazine, it, preached, independence, but, within, the, bounds, of, peace, as, far, as, possible, its, goal, was, passive, resistance, the, unrest, spread, from, calcutta, to, the, surrounding, regions, of, bengal, when, students, returned, home, to, their, villages, and, towns, some, joined, local, political, youth, clubs, emerging, in, bengal, at, the, time, some, engaged, in, robberies, to, fund, arms, and, even, attempted, to, take, the, lives, of, raj, officials, however, the, conspiracies, generally, failed, in, the, face, of, intense, police, work, the, swadeshi, boycott, movement, cut, imports, of, british, textiles, by, 25, the, swadeshi, cloth, although, more, expensive, and, somewhat, less, comfortable, than, its, lancashire, competitor, was, worn, as, a, mark, of, national, pride, by, people, all, over, india, the, overwhelming, but, predominantly, hindu, protest, against, the, partition, of, bengal, and, the, fear, in, its, wake, of, reforms, favouring, the, hindu, majority, led, the, muslim, elite, in, india, to, meet, with, the, new, viceroy, lord, minto, in, 1906, and, to, ask, for, separate, electorates, for, muslims, in, conjunction, they, demanded, proportional, legislative, representation, reflecting, both, their, status, as, former, rulers, and, their, record, of, cooperating, with, the, british, this, led, in, december, 1906, to, the, founding, of, the, all, india, muslim, league, in, dacca, although, curzon, by, now, had, resigned, his, position, over, a, dispute, with, his, military, chief, lord, kitchener, and, returned, to, england, the, league, was, in, favour, of, his, partition, plan, the, muslim, elite, s, position, which, was, reflected, in, the, league, s, position, had, crystallized, gradually, over, the, previous, three, decades, beginning, with, the, revelations, of, the, census, of, british, india, in, 1871, which, had, for, the, first, time, estimated, the, populations, in, regions, of, the, muslim, majority, for, his, part, curzon, s, desire, to, court, the, muslims, of, east, bengal, had, arisen, from, british, anxieties, ever, since, the, 1871, census, and, in, light, of, the, history, of, muslims, fighting, them, in, the, 1857, mutiny, and, the, second, anglo, afghan, war, about, indian, muslims, rebelling, against, the, crown, in, the, three, decades, since, muslim, leaders, across, northern, india, had, intermittently, experienced, public, animosity, from, some, of, the, new, hindu, political, and, social, groups, the, arya, samaj, for, example, had, not, only, supported, cow, protection, societies, in, their, agitation, but, also, distraught, at, the, 1871, census, s, muslim, numbers, organized, reconversion, events, for, the, purpose, of, welcoming, muslims, back, to, the, hindu, fold, in, 1905, when, tilak, and, lajpat, rai, attempted, to, rise, to, leadership, positions, in, the, congress, and, the, congress, itself, rallied, around, the, symbolism, of, kali, muslim, fears, increased, it, was, not, lost, on, many, muslims, for, example, that, the, rallying, cry, bande, mataram, had, first, appeared, in, the, novel, anand, math, in, which, hindus, had, battled, their, muslim, oppressors, lastly, the, muslim, elite, and, among, it, dacca, nawab, khwaja, salimullah, who, hosted, the, league, s, first, meeting, in, his, mansion, in, shahbag, was, aware, that, a, new, province, with, a, muslim, majority, would, directly, benefit, muslims, aspiring, to, political, power, the, first, steps, were, taken, toward, self, government, in, british, india, in, the, late, 19th, century, with, the, appointment, of, indian, counsellors, to, advise, the, british, viceroy, and, the, establishment, of, provincial, councils, with, indian, members, the, british, subsequently, widened, participation, in, legislative, councils, with, the, indian, councils, act, of, 1892, municipal, corporations, and, district, boards, were, created, for, local, administration, they, included, elected, indian, members, the, indian, councils, act, 1909, known, as, the, morley, minto, reforms, john, morley, was, the, secretary, of, state, for, india, and, minto, was, viceroy, gave, indians, limited, roles, in, the, central, and, provincial, legislatures, upper, class, indians, rich, landowners, and, businessmen, were, favoured, the, muslim, community, was, made, a, separate, electorate, and, granted, double, representation, the, goals, were, quite, conservative, but, they, did, advance, the, elective, principle, the, partition, of, bengal, was, rescinded, in, 1911, and, announced, at, the, delhi, durbar, at, which, king, george, v, came, in, person, and, was, crowned, emperor, of, india, he, announced, the, capital, would, be, moved, from, calcutta, to, delhi, this, period, saw, an, increase, in, the, activities, of, revolutionary, groups, which, included, bengal, s, anushilan, samiti, and, the, punjab, s, ghadar, party, however, the, british, authorities, were, able, to, crush, violent, rebels, swiftly, partly, because, the, mainstream, of, educated, indian, politicians, opposed, violent, revolution, the, first, world, war, would, prove, to, be, a, watershed, in, the, imperial, relationship, between, britain, and, india, shortly, before, the, outbreak, of, war, the, government, of, india, had, indicated, that, they, could, furnish, two, divisions, plus, a, cavalry, brigade, with, a, further, division, in, case, of, emergency, some, 1, 4, million, indian, and, british, soldiers, of, the, british, indian, army, took, part, in, the, war, primarily, in, iraq, and, the, middle, east, their, participation, had, a, wider, cultural, fallout, as, news, spread, of, how, bravely, soldiers, fought, and, died, alongside, british, soldiers, as, well, as, soldiers, from, dominions, like, canada, and, australia, india, s, international, profile, rose, during, the, 1920s, as, it, became, a, founding, member, of, the, league, of, nations, in, 1920, and, participated, under, the, name, les, indes, anglaises, british, india, in, the, 1920, summer, olympics, in, antwerp, back, in, india, especially, among, the, leaders, of, the, indian, national, congress, the, war, led, to, calls, for, greater, self, government, for, indians, at, the, onset, of, world, war, i, the, reassignment, of, most, of, the, british, army, in, india, to, europe, and, mesopotamia, had, led, the, previous, viceroy, lord, harding, to, worry, about, the, risks, involved, in, denuding, india, of, troops, revolutionary, violence, had, already, been, a, concern, in, british, india, consequently, in, 1915, to, strengthen, its, powers, during, what, it, saw, was, a, time, of, increased, vulnerability, the, government, of, india, passed, the, defence, of, india, act, 1915, which, allowed, it, to, intern, politically, dangerous, dissidents, without, due, process, and, added, to, the, power, it, already, had, under, the, 1910, press, act, both, to, imprison, journalists, without, trial, and, to, censor, the, press, it, was, under, the, defence, of, india, act, that, the, ali, brothers, were, imprisoned, in, 1916, and, annie, besant, a, european, woman, and, ordinarily, more, problematic, to, imprison, was, arrested, in, 1917, now, as, constitutional, reform, began, to, be, discussed, in, earnest, the, british, began, to, consider, how, new, moderate, indians, could, be, brought, into, the, fold, of, constitutional, politics, and, simultaneously, how, the, hand, of, established, constitutionalists, could, be, strengthened, however, since, the, government, of, india, wanted, to, ensure, against, any, sabotage, of, the, reform, process, by, extremists, and, since, its, reform, plan, was, devised, during, a, time, when, extremist, violence, had, ebbed, as, a, result, of, increased, governmental, control, it, also, began, to, consider, how, some, of, its, wartime, powers, could, be, extended, into, peacetime, after, the, 1906, split, between, the, moderates, and, the, extremists, in, the, indian, national, congress, organised, political, activity, by, the, congress, had, remained, fragmented, until, 1914, when, bal, gangadhar, tilak, was, released, from, prison, and, began, to, sound, out, other, congress, leaders, about, possible, reunification, that, however, had, to, wait, until, the, demise, of, tilak, s, principal, moderate, opponents, gopal, krishna, gokhale, and, pherozeshah, mehta, in, 1915, whereupon, an, agreement, was, reached, for, tilak, s, ousted, group, to, re, enter, the, congress, in, the, 1916, lucknow, session, of, the, congress, tilak, s, supporters, were, able, to, push, through, a, more, radical, resolution, which, asked, for, the, british, to, declare, that, it, was, their, aim, and, intention, to, confer, self, government, on, india, at, an, early, date, soon, other, such, rumblings, began, to, appear, in, public, pronouncements, in, 1917, in, the, imperial, legislative, council, madan, mohan, malaviya, spoke, of, the, expectations, the, war, had, generated, in, india, i, venture, to, say, that, the, war, has, put, the, clock, fifty, years, forward, the, reforms, after, the, war, will, have, to, be, such, as, will, satisfy, the, aspirations, of, her, india, s, people, to, take, their, legitimate, part, in, the, administration, of, their, own, country, the, 1916, lucknow, session, of, the, congress, was, also, the, venue, of, an, unanticipated, mutual, effort, by, the, congress, and, the, muslim, league, the, occasion, for, which, was, provided, by, the, wartime, partnership, between, germany, and, turkey, since, the, turkish, sultan, or, khalifah, had, also, sporadically, claimed, guardianship, of, the, islamic, holy, sites, of, mecca, medina, and, jerusalem, and, since, the, british, and, their, allies, were, now, in, conflict, with, turkey, doubts, began, to, increase, among, some, indian, muslims, about, the, religious, neutrality, of, the, british, doubts, that, had, already, surfaced, as, a, result, of, the, reunification, of, bengal, in, 1911, a, decision, that, was, seen, as, ill, disposed, to, muslims, in, the, lucknow, pact, the, league, joined, the, congress, in, the, proposal, for, greater, self, government, that, was, campaigned, for, by, tilak, and, his, supporters, in, return, the, congress, accepted, separate, electorates, for, muslims, in, the, provincial, legislatures, as, well, as, the, imperial, legislative, council, in, 1916, the, muslim, league, had, anywhere, between, 500, and, 800, members, and, did, not, yet, have, the, wider, following, among, indian, muslims, that, it, enjoyed, in, later, years, in, the, league, itself, the, pact, did, not, have, unanimous, backing, having, largely, been, negotiated, by, a, group, of, young, party, muslims, from, the, united, provinces, up, most, prominently, two, brothers, mohammad, and, shaukat, ali, who, had, embraced, the, pan, islamic, cause, however, it, did, have, the, support, of, a, young, lawyer, from, bombay, muhammad, ali, jinnah, who, was, later, to, rise, to, leadership, roles, in, both, the, league, and, the, indian, independence, movement, in, later, years, as, the, full, ramifications, of, the, pact, unfolded, it, was, seen, as, benefiting, the, muslim, minority, lites, of, provinces, like, up, and, bihar, more, than, the, muslim, majorities, of, punjab, and, bengal, nonetheless, at, the, time, the, lucknow, pact, was, an, important, milestone, in, nationalistic, agitation, and, was, seen, as, such, by, the, british, during, 1916, two, home, rule, leagues, were, founded, within, the, indian, national, congress, by, tilak, and, annie, besant, respectively, to, promote, home, rule, among, indians, and, also, to, elevate, the, stature, of, the, founders, within, the, congress, itself, besant, for, her, part, was, also, keen, to, demonstrate, the, superiority, of, this, new, form, of, organised, agitation, which, had, achieved, some, success, in, the, irish, home, rule, movement, over, the, political, violence, that, had, intermittently, plagued, the, subcontinent, during, the, years, 1907, 1914, the, two, leagues, focused, their, attention, on, complementary, geographical, regions, tilak, s, in, western, india, in, the, southern, bombay, presidency, and, besant, s, in, the, rest, of, the, country, but, especially, in, the, madras, presidency, and, in, regions, like, sind, and, gujarat, that, had, hitherto, been, considered, politically, dormant, by, the, congress, both, leagues, rapidly, acquired, new, members, approximately, thirty, thousand, each, in, a, little, over, a, year, and, began, to, publish, inexpensive, newspapers, their, propaganda, also, turned, to, posters, pamphlets, and, political, religious, songs, and, later, to, mass, meetings, which, not, only, attracted, greater, numbers, than, in, earlier, congress, sessions, but, also, entirely, new, social, groups, such, as, non, brahmins, traders, farmers, students, and, lower, level, government, workers, although, they, did, not, achieve, the, magnitude, or, character, of, a, nationwide, mass, movement, the, home, rule, leagues, both, deepened, and, widened, organised, political, agitation, for, self, rule, in, india, the, british, authorities, reacted, by, imposing, restrictions, on, the, leagues, including, shutting, out, students, from, meetings, and, banning, the, two, leaders, from, travelling, to, certain, provinces, the, year, 1915, also, saw, the, return, of, mohandas, karamchand, gandhi, to, india, already, known, in, india, as, a, result, of, his, civil, liberties, protests, on, behalf, of, the, indians, in, south, africa, gandhi, followed, the, advice, of, his, mentor, gopal, krishna, gokhale, and, chose, not, to, make, any, public, pronouncements, during, the, first, year, of, his, return, but, instead, spent, the, year, travelling, observing, the, country, at, first, hand, and, writing, earlier, during, his, south, africa, sojourn, gandhi, a, lawyer, by, profession, had, represented, an, indian, community, which, although, small, was, sufficiently, diverse, to, be, a, microcosm, of, india, itself, in, tackling, the, challenge, of, holding, this, community, together, and, simultaneously, confronting, the, colonial, authority, he, had, created, a, technique, of, non, violent, resistance, which, he, labelled, satyagraha, or, striving, for, truth, for, gandhi, satyagraha, was, different, from, passive, resistance, by, then, a, familiar, technique, of, social, protest, which, he, regarded, as, a, practical, strategy, adopted, by, the, weak, in, the, face, of, superior, force, satyagraha, on, the, other, hand, was, for, him, the, last, resort, of, those, strong, enough, in, their, commitment, to, truth, to, undergo, suffering, in, its, cause, ahimsa, or, non, violence, which, formed, the, underpinning, of, satyagraha, came, to, represent, the, twin, pillar, with, truth, of, gandhi, s, unorthodox, religious, outlook, on, life, during, the, years, 1907, 1914, gandhi, tested, the, technique, of, satyagraha, in, a, number, of, protests, on, behalf, of, the, indian, community, in, south, africa, against, the, unjust, racial, laws, also, during, his, time, in, south, africa, in, his, essay, hind, swaraj, 1909, gandhi, formulated, his, vision, of, swaraj, or, self, rule, for, india, based, on, three, vital, ingredients, solidarity, between, indians, of, different, faiths, but, most, of, all, between, hindus, and, muslims, the, removal, of, untouchability, from, indian, society, and, the, exercise, of, swadeshi, the, boycott, of, manufactured, foreign, goods, and, the, revival, of, indian, cottage, industry, the, first, two, he, felt, were, essential, for, india, to, be, an, egalitarian, and, tolerant, society, one, befitting, the, principles, of, truth, and, ahimsa, while, the, last, by, making, indians, more, self, reliant, would, break, the, cycle, of, dependence, that, was, perpetuating, not, only, the, direction, and, tenor, of, the, british, rule, in, india, but, also, the, british, commitment, to, it, at, least, until, 1920, the, british, presence, itself, was, not, a, stumbling, block, in, gandhi, s, conception, of, swaraj, rather, it, was, the, inability, of, indians, to, create, a, modern, society, gandhi, made, his, political, debut, in, india, in, 1917, in, champaran, district, in, bihar, near, the, nepal, border, where, he, was, invited, by, a, group, of, disgruntled, tenant, farmers, who, for, many, years, had, been, forced, into, planting, indigo, for, dyes, on, a, portion, of, their, land, and, then, selling, it, at, below, market, prices, to, the, british, planters, who, had, leased, them, the, land, upon, his, arrival, in, the, district, gandhi, was, joined, by, other, agitators, including, a, young, congress, leader, rajendra, prasad, from, bihar, who, would, become, a, loyal, supporter, of, gandhi, and, go, on, to, play, a, prominent, role, in, the, indian, independence, movement, when, gandhi, was, ordered, to, leave, by, the, local, british, authorities, he, refused, on, moral, grounds, setting, up, his, refusal, as, a, form, of, individual, satyagraha, soon, under, pressure, from, the, viceroy, in, delhi, who, was, anxious, to, maintain, domestic, peace, during, wartime, the, provincial, government, rescinded, gandhi, s, expulsion, order, and, later, agreed, to, an, official, enquiry, into, the, case, although, the, british, planters, eventually, gave, in, they, were, not, won, over, to, the, farmers, cause, and, thereby, did, not, produce, the, optimal, outcome, of, a, satyagraha, that, gandhi, had, hoped, for, similarly, the, farmers, themselves, although, pleased, at, the, resolution, responded, less, than, enthusiastically, to, the, concurrent, projects, of, rural, empowerment, and, education, that, gandhi, had, inaugurated, in, keeping, with, his, ideal, of, swaraj, the, following, year, gandhi, launched, two, more, satyagrahas, both, in, his, native, gujarat, one, in, the, rural, kaira, district, where, land, owning, farmers, were, protesting, increased, land, revenue, and, the, other, in, the, city, of, ahmedabad, where, workers, in, an, indian, owned, textile, mill, were, distressed, about, their, low, wages, the, satyagraha, in, ahmedabad, took, the, form, of, gandhi, fasting, and, supporting, the, workers, in, a, strike, which, eventually, led, to, a, settlement, in, kaira, in, contrast, although, the, farmers, cause, received, publicity, from, gandhi, s, presence, the, satyagraha, itself, which, consisted, of, the, farmers, collective, decision, to, withhold, payment, was, not, immediately, successful, as, the, british, authorities, refused, to, back, down, the, agitation, in, kaira, gained, for, gandhi, another, lifelong, lieutenant, in, sardar, vallabhbhai, patel, who, had, organised, the, farmers, and, who, too, would, go, on, to, play, a, leadership, role, in, the, indian, independence, movement, in, 1916, in, the, face, of, new, strength, demonstrated, by, the, nationalists, with, the, signing, of, the, lucknow, pact, and, the, founding, of, the, home, rule, leagues, and, the, realisation, after, the, disaster, in, the, mesopotamian, campaign, that, the, war, would, likely, last, longer, the, new, viceroy, lord, chelmsford, cautioned, that, the, government, of, india, needed, to, be, more, responsive, to, indian, opinion, towards, the, end, of, the, year, after, discussions, with, the, government, in, london, he, suggested, that, the, british, demonstrate, their, good, faith, in, light, of, the, indian, war, role, through, a, number, of, public, actions, including, awards, of, titles, and, honours, to, princes, granting, of, commissions, in, the, army, to, indians, and, removal, of, the, much, reviled, cotton, excise, duty, but, most, importantly, an, announcement, of, britain, s, future, plans, for, india, and, an, indication, of, some, concrete, steps, after, more, discussion, in, august, 1917, the, new, liberal, secretary, of, state, for, india, edwin, montagu, announced, the, british, aim, of, increasing, association, of, indians, in, every, branch, of, the, administration, and, the, gradual, development, of, self, governing, institutions, with, a, view, to, the, progressive, realisation, of, responsible, government, in, india, as, an, integral, part, of, the, british, empire, although, the, plan, envisioned, limited, self, government, at, first, only, in, the, provinces, with, india, emphatically, within, the, british, empire, it, represented, the, first, british, proposal, for, any, form, of, representative, government, in, a, non, white, colony, montagu, and, chelmsford, presented, their, report, in, july, 1918, after, a, long, fact, finding, trip, through, india, the, previous, winter, after, more, discussion, by, the, government, and, parliament, in, britain, and, another, tour, by, the, franchise, and, functions, committee, for, the, purpose, of, identifying, who, among, the, indian, population, could, vote, in, future, elections, the, government, of, india, act, 1919, also, known, as, the, montagu, chelmsford, reforms, was, passed, in, december, 1919, the, new, act, enlarged, both, the, provincial, and, imperial, legislative, councils, and, repealed, the, government, of, india, s, recourse, to, the, official, majority, in, unfavourable, votes, although, departments, like, defence, foreign, affairs, criminal, law, communications, and, income, tax, were, retained, by, the, viceroy, and, the, central, government, in, new, delhi, other, departments, like, public, health, education, land, revenue, local, self, government, were, transferred, to, the, provinces, the, provinces, themselves, were, now, to, be, administered, under, a, new, diarchical, system, whereby, some, areas, like, education, agriculture, infrastructure, development, and, local, self, government, became, the, preserve, of, indian, ministers, and, legislatures, and, ultimately, the, indian, electorates, while, others, like, irrigation, land, revenue, police, prisons, and, control, of, media, remained, within, the, purview, of, the, british, governor, and, his, executive, council, the, new, act, also, made, it, easier, for, indians, to, be, admitted, into, the, civil, services, and, the, army, officer, corps, a, greater, number, of, indians, were, now, enfranchised, although, for, voting, at, the, national, level, they, constituted, only, 10, of, the, total, adult, male, population, many, of, whom, were, still, illiterate, in, the, provincial, legislatures, the, british, continued, to, exercise, some, control, by, setting, aside, seats, for, special, interests, they, considered, cooperative, or, useful, in, particular, rural, candidates, generally, sympathetic, to, british, rule, and, less, confrontational, were, assigned, more, seats, than, their, urban, counterparts, seats, were, also, reserved, for, non, brahmins, landowners, businessmen, and, college, graduates, the, principal, of, communal, representation, an, integral, part, of, the, minto, morley, reforms, and, more, recently, of, the, congress, muslim, league, lucknow, pact, was, reaffirmed, with, seats, being, reserved, for, muslims, sikhs, indian, christians, anglo, indians, and, domiciled, europeans, in, both, provincial, and, imperial, legislative, councils, the, montagu, chelmsford, reforms, offered, indians, the, most, significant, opportunity, yet, for, exercising, legislative, power, especially, at, the, provincial, level, however, that, opportunity, was, also, restricted, by, the, still, limited, number, of, eligible, voters, by, the, small, budgets, available, to, provincial, legislatures, and, by, the, presence, of, rural, and, special, interest, seats, that, were, seen, as, instruments, of, british, control, its, scope, was, unsatisfactory, to, the, indian, political, leadership, famously, expressed, by, annie, besant, as, something, unworthy, of, england, to, offer, and, india, to, accept, in, 1917, as, montagu, and, chelmsford, were, compiling, their, report, a, committee, chaired, by, a, british, judge, sidney, rowlatt, and, was, tasked, with, investigating, revolutionary, conspiracies, with, the, unstated, goal, of, extending, the, government, s, wartime, powers, the, rowlatt, committee, comprised, four, british, and, two, indian, members, including, sir, basil, scott, and, diwan, bahadur, sir, c, v, kumaraswami, sastri, the, present, and, future, chief, justices, of, the, high, court, of, bombay, and, the, high, court, of, madras, it, presented, its, report, in, july, 1918, and, identified, three, regions, of, conspiratorial, insurgency, bengal, the, bombay, presidency, and, the, punjab, to, combat, subversive, acts, in, these, regions, the, committee, unanimously, recommended, that, the, government, use, emergency, powers, akin, to, its, wartime, authority, which, included, the, ability, to, try, cases, of, sedition, by, a, panel, of, three, judges, and, without, juries, exaction, of, securities, from, suspects, governmental, overseeing, of, residences, of, suspects, and, the, power, for, provincial, governments, to, arrest, and, detain, suspects, in, short, term, detention, facilities, and, without, trial, with, the, end, of, world, war, i, there, was, also, a, change, in, the, economic, climate, by, the, end, of, 1919, 1, 5, million, indians, had, served, in, the, armed, services, in, either, combatant, or, non, combatant, roles, and, india, had, provided, 146, million, in, revenue, for, the, war, the, increased, taxes, coupled, with, disruptions, in, both, domestic, and, international, trade, had, the, effect, of, approximately, doubling, the, index, of, overall, prices, in, india, between, 1914, and, 1920, returning, war, veterans, especially, in, the, punjab, created, a, growing, unemployment, crisis, and, post, war, inflation, led, to, food, riots, in, bombay, madras, and, bengal, provinces, a, situation, that, was, made, only, worse, by, the, failure, of, the, 1918, 19, monsoon, and, by, profiteering, and, speculation, the, global, influenza, epidemic, and, the, bolshevik, revolution, of, 1917, added, to, the, general, jitters, the, former, among, the, population, already, experiencing, economic, woes, and, the, latter, among, government, officials, fearing, a, similar, revolution, in, india, to, combat, what, it, saw, as, a, coming, crisis, the, government, now, drafted, the, rowlatt, committee, s, recommendations, into, two, rowlatt, bills, although, the, bills, were, authorised, for, legislative, consideration, by, edwin, montagu, they, were, done, so, unwillingly, with, the, accompanying, declaration, i, loathe, the, suggestion, at, first, sight, of, preserving, the, defence, of, india, act, in, peacetime, to, such, an, extent, as, rowlatt, and, his, friends, think, necessary, in, the, ensuing, discussion, and, vote, in, the, imperial, legislative, council, all, indian, members, voiced, opposition, to, the, bills, the, government, of, india, was, nevertheless, able, to, use, of, its, official, majority, to, ensure, passage, of, the, bills, early, in, 1919, however, what, it, passed, in, deference, to, the, indian, opposition, was, a, lesser, version, of, the, first, bill, which, now, allowed, extrajudicial, powers, but, for, a, period, of, exactly, three, years, and, for, the, prosecution, solely, of, anarchical, and, revolutionary, movements, dropping, entirely, the, second, bill, involving, modification, the, indian, penal, code, even, so, when, it, was, passed, the, new, rowlatt, act, aroused, widespread, indignation, throughout, india, and, brought, gandhi, to, the, forefront, of, the, nationalist, movement, the, jallianwala, bagh, massacre, or, amritsar, massacre, took, place, in, the, jallianwala, bagh, public, garden, in, the, predominantly, sikh, northern, city, of, amritsar, after, days, of, unrest, brigadier, general, reginald, e, h, dyer, forbade, public, meetings, and, on, sunday, 13, april, 1919, fifty, british, indian, army, soldiers, commanded, by, dyer, began, shooting, at, an, unarmed, gathering, of, thousands, of, men, women, and, children, without, warning, casualty, estimates, vary, widely, with, the, government, of, india, reporting, 379, dead, with, 1, 100, wounded, the, indian, national, congress, estimated, three, times, the, number, of, dead, dyer, was, removed, from, duty, but, he, became, a, celebrated, hero, in, britain, among, people, with, connections, to, the, raj, historians, consider, the, episode, was, a, decisive, step, towards, the, end, of, british, rule, in, india, in, 1920, after, the, british, government, refused, to, back, down, gandhi, began, his, campaign, of, non, cooperation, prompting, many, indians, to, return, british, awards, and, honours, to, resign, from, the, civil, services, and, to, again, boycott, british, goods, in, addition, gandhi, reorganised, the, congress, transforming, it, into, a, mass, movement, and, opening, its, membership, to, even, the, poorest, indians, although, gandhi, halted, the, non, cooperation, movement, in, 1922, after, the, violent, incident, at, chauri, chaura, the, movement, revived, again, in, the, mid, 1920s, the, visit, in, 1928, of, the, british, simon, commission, charged, with, instituting, constitutional, reform, in, india, resulted, in, widespread, protests, throughout, the, country, earlier, in, 1925, non, violent, protests, of, the, congress, had, resumed, too, this, time, in, gujarat, and, led, by, patel, who, organised, farmers, to, refuse, payment, of, increased, land, taxes, the, success, of, this, protest, the, bardoli, satyagraha, brought, gandhi, back, into, the, fold, of, active, politics, at, its, annual, session, in, lahore, the, indian, national, congress, under, the, presidency, of, jawaharlal, nehru, issued, a, demand, for, purna, swaraj, hindustani, language, complete, independence, or, purna, swarajya, the, declaration, was, drafted, by, the, congress, working, committee, which, included, gandhi, nehru, patel, and, chakravarthi, rajagopalachari, gandhi, subsequently, led, an, expanded, movement, of, civil, disobedience, culminating, in, 1930, with, the, salt, satyagraha, in, which, thousands, of, indians, defied, the, tax, on, salt, by, marching, to, the, sea, and, making, their, own, salt, by, evaporating, seawater, although, many, including, gandhi, were, arrested, the, british, government, eventually, gave, in, and, in, 1931, gandhi, travelled, to, london, to, negotiate, new, reform, at, the, round, table, conferences, in, local, terms, british, control, rested, on, the, indian, civil, service, ics, but, it, faced, growing, difficulties, fewer, and, fewer, young, men, in, britain, were, interested, in, joining, and, the, continuing, distrust, of, indians, resulted, in, a, declining, base, in, terms, of, quality, and, quantity, by, 1945, indians, were, numerically, dominant, in, the, ics, and, at, issue, was, divided, loyalty, between, the, empire, and, independence, the, finances, of, the, raj, depended, on, land, taxes, and, these, became, problematic, in, the, 1930s, epstein, argues, that, after, 1919, it, became, harder, and, harder, to, collect, the, land, revenue, the, raj, s, suppression, of, civil, disobedience, after, 1934, temporarily, increased, the, power, of, the, revenue, agents, but, after, 1937, they, were, forced, by, the, new, congress, controlled, provincial, governments, to, hand, back, confiscated, land, again, the, outbreak, of, war, strengthened, them, in, the, face, of, the, quit, india, movement, the, revenue, collectors, had, to, rely, on, military, force, and, by, 1946, 47, direct, british, control, was, rapidly, disappearing, in, much, of, the, countryside, in, 1935, after, the, round, table, conferences, parliament, passed, the, government, of, india, act, 1935, which, authorised, the, establishment, of, independent, legislative, assemblies, in, all, provinces, of, british, india, the, creation, of, a, central, government, incorporating, both, the, british, provinces, and, the, princely, states, and, the, protection, of, muslim, minorities, the, future, constitution, of, independent, india, was, based, on, this, act, however, it, divided, the, electorate, into, 19, religious, and, social, categories, e, g, muslims, sikhs, indian, christians, depressed, classes, landholders, commerce, and, industry, europeans, anglo, indians, etc, each, of, which, was, given, separate, representation, in, the, provincial, legislative, assemblies, a, voter, could, cast, a, vote, only, for, candidates, in, his,

of, 1, 300, million, in, addition, heavy, british, spending, on, munitions, produced, in, india, such, as, uniforms, rifles, machine, guns, field, artillery, and, ammunition, led, to, a, rapid,

provinces, bihar, and, western, bengal, the, large, wartime, british, army, presence, crushed, the, movement, in, a, little, more, than, six, weeks, nonetheless, a, portion, of, the, movement, formed, for, a, time, an, underground, provisional, government, on, the, border, with, nepal, in, other, parts, of, india, the, movement, was, less, spontaneous, and, the, protest, less, intensive, however, it, lasted, sporadically, into, the, summer, of, 1943, earlier, subhas, chandra, bose, who, had, been, a, leader, of, the, younger, radical, wing, of, the, indian, national, congress, in, the, late, 1920s, and, 1930s, had, risen, to, become, congress, president, from, 1938, to, 1939, however, he, was, ousted, from, the, congress, in, 1939, following, differences, with, the, high, command, and, subsequently, placed, under, house, arrest, by, the, british, before, escaping, from, india, in, early, 1941, he, turned, to, nazi, germany, and, imperial, japan, for, help, in, gaining, india, s, independence, by, force, with, japanese, support, he, organised, the, indian, national, army, composed, largely, of, indian, soldiers, of, the, british, indian, army, who, had, been, captured, by, the, japanese, in, the, battle, of, singapore, as, the, war, turned, against, them, the, japanese, came, to, support, a, number, of, puppet, and, provisional, governments, in, the, captured, regions, including, those, in, burma, the, philippines, and, vietnam, and, in, addition, the, provisional, government, of, azad, hind, presided, by, bose, bose, s, effort, however, was, short, lived, in, mid, 1944, the, british, army, first, halted, and, then, reversed, the, japanese, u, go, offensive, beginning, the, successful, part, of, the, burma, campaign, bose, s, indian, national, army, largely, disintegrated, during, the, subsequent, fighting, in, burma, with, its, remaining, elements, surrendering, with, the, recapture, of, singapore, in, september, 1945, bose, died, in, august, from, third, degree, burns, received, after, attempting, to, escape, in, an, overloaded, japanese, plane, which, crashed, in, taiwan, which, many, indians, believe, did, not, happen, although, bose, was, unsuccessful, he, roused, patriotic, feelings, in, india, in, january, 1946, a, number, of, mutinies, broke, out, in, the, armed, services, starting, with, that, of, raf, servicemen, frustrated, with, their, slow, repatriation, to, britain, the, mutinies, came, to, a, head, with, mutiny, of, the, royal, indian, navy, in, bombay, in, february, 1946, followed, by, others, in, calcutta, madras, and, karachi, although, the, mutinies, were, rapidly, suppressed, they, had, the, effect, of, spurring, the, new, labour, government, in, britain, to, action, and, leading, to, the, cabinet, mission, to, india, led, by, the, secretary, of, state, for, india, lord, pethick, lawrence, and, including, sir, stafford, cripps, who, had, visited, four, years, before, also, in, early, 1946, new, elections, were, called, in, india, earlier, at, the, end, of, the, war, in, 1945, the, colonial, government, had, announced, the, public, trial, of, three, senior, officers, of, bose, s, defeated, indian, national, army, who, stood, accused, of, treason, now, as, the, trials, began, the, congress, leadership, although, ambivalent, towards, the, ina, chose, to, defend, the, accused, officers, the, subsequent, convictions, of, the, officers, the, public, outcry, against, the, convictions, and, the, eventual, remission, of, the, sentences, created, positive, propaganda, for, the, congress, which, only, helped, in, the, party, s, subsequent, electoral, victories, in, eight, of, the, eleven, provinces, the, negotiations, between, the, congress, and, the, muslim, league, however, stumbled, over,

india, the, following, day, hindu, muslim, riots, broke, out, in, calcutta, and, quickly, spread, throughout, british, india, although, the, government, of, india, and, the, congress, were, both, shaken, by, the, course, of, events, in, september, a, congress, led, interim, government, was, installed, with, jawaharlal, nehru, as, united, india, s, prime, minister, later, that, year, the,

the, reliability, of, native, forces, for, continuing, to, control, an, increasingly, restless, british, india, decided, to, end, british, rule, of, india, and, in, early, 1947, britain, announced,

both, ceremonies, the, great, majority, of, indians, remained, in, place, with, independence, but, in, border, areas, millions, of, people, muslim, sikh, and, hindu, relocated, across, the, newly, drawn, borders, in, punjab, where, the, new, border, lines, divided, the, sikh, regions, in, half, there, was, much, bloodshed, in, bengal, and, bihar, where, gandhi, s, presence, assuaged, communal,

provided, for, a, cabinet, level, secretary, of, state, for, india, and, a, fifteen, member, council, of, india, whose, members, were, required, as, one, prerequisite, of, membership, to, have, spent, at, least, ten, years, in, india, and, to, have, done, so, no, more, than, ten, years, before, although, the, secretary, of, state, formulated, the, policy, instructions, to, be, communicated, to, india, he, was, required, in, most, instances, to, consult, the, council, but, especially, so, in, matters, relating, to, spending, of, indian, revenues, the, act, envisaged, a, system, of, double, government, in, which, the, council, ideally, served, both, as, a, check, on, excesses, in, imperial, policy, making, and, as, a, body, of, up, to, date, expertise, on, india, however, the, secretary, of, state, also, had, special, emergency, powers, that, allowed, him, to, make, unilateral, decisions, and, in, reality, the, council, s, expertise, was, sometimes, outdated, from, 1858, until, 1947, twenty, seven, individuals, served, as, secretary, of, state, for, india, and, directed, the, india, office, these, included, sir, charles, wood, 1859, 1866, the, marquess, of, salisbury, 1874, 1878,

unchanged, in, 1907, for, the, first, time, two, indians, were, appointed, to, the, council, they, were, k, g, gupta, and, syed, hussain, bilgrami, in, calcutta, the, governor, general, remained, head, of, the, government, of, india, and, now, was, more, commonly, called, the, viceroy, on, account, of, his, secondary, role, as, the, crown, s, representative, to, the, nominally, sovereign, princely, states, he, was, however, now, responsible, to, the, secretary, of, state, in, london, and, through, him, to, parliament, a, system, of, double, government, had, already, been, in, place, during, the, company, s, rule, in, india, from, the, time, of, pitt, s, india, act, of, 1784, the, governor, general, in, the, capital, calcutta, and, the, governor, in, a, subordinate, presidency, madras, or, bombay, was, each, required, to, consult, his, advisory, council, executive, orders, in, calcutta, for, example, were, issued, in, the, name, of, governor, general, in, council, i, e, the, governor, general, with, the, advice, of, the, council, the, company, s, system, of, double, government, had, its, critics, since, from, the, time, of, the, system, s, inception, there, had, been, intermittent, feuding, between, the, governor, general, and, his, council, still, the, act, of, 1858, made, no, major, changes, in, governance, however, in, the, years, immediately, thereafter, which, were, also, the, years, of, post, rebellion, reconstruction, viceroy, lord, canning, found, the, collective, decision, making, of, the, council, to, be, too, time, consuming, for, the, pressing, tasks, ahead, so, he, requested, the, portfolio, system, of, an, executive, council, in, which, the, business, of, each, government, department, the, portfolio, was, assigned, to, and, became, the, responsibility, of, a, single, council, member, routine, departmental, decisions, were, made, exclusively, by, the, member, but, important, decisions, required, the, consent, of, the, governor, general, and, in, the, absence, of, such, consent, required, discussion, by, the, entire, executive, council, this, innovation, in, indian, governance, was, promulgated, in, the, indian, councils, act, 1861, if, the, government, of, india, needed, to, enact, new, laws, the, councils, act, allowed, for, a, legislative, council, an, expansion, of, the, executive, council, by, up, to, twelve, additional, members, each, appointed, to, a, two, year, term, with, half, the, members, consisting, of, british, officials, of, the, government, termed, official, and, allowed, to, vote, and, the, other, half, comprising, indians, and, domiciled, britons, in, india, termed, non, official, and, serving, only, in, an, advisory, capacity, all, laws, enacted, by, legislative, councils, in, india, whether, by, the, imperial, legislative, council, in, calcutta, or, by, the, provincial, ones, in, madras, and, bombay, required, the, final, assent, of, the, secretary, of, state, in, london, this, prompted, sir, charles, wood, the, second, secretary, of, state, to, describe, the, government, of, india, as, a, despotism, controlled, from, home, moreover, although, the, appointment, of, indians, to, the, legislative, council, was, a, response, to, calls, after, the, 1857, rebellion, most, notably, by, sayyid, ahmad, khan, for, more, consultation, with, indians, the, indians, so, appointed, were, from, the, landed, aristocracy, often, chosen, for, their, loyalty, and, far, from, representative, even, so, the, tiny, advances, in, the, practice, of, representative, government, were, intended, to, provide, safety, valves, for, the, expression, of, public, opinion, which, had, been, so, badly, misjudged, before, the, rebellion, indian, affairs, now, also, came, to, be, more, closely, examined, in, the, british, parliament, and, more, widely, discussed, in, the, british, press, with, the, promulgation, of, the, government, of, india, act, 1935, the, council, of, india,

legislation, merged, the, crown, and, the, old, east, india, company, courts, and, introduced, a, new, penal, code, as, well, as, new, codes, of, civil, and, criminal, procedure, based, largely, on, english, law, in, the, 1860s, 1880s, the, raj, set, up, compulsory, registration, of, births, deaths, and, marriages, as, well, as, adoptions, property, deeds, and, wills, the, goal, was, to, create, a, stable, usable, public, record, and, verifiable, identities, however, there, was, opposition, from, both, muslim, and, hindu, elements, who, complained, that, the, new, procedures, for, census, taking, and, registration, threatened, to, uncover, female, privacy, purdah, rules, prohibited, women, from, saying, their, husband, s, name, or, having, their, photograph, taken, an, all, india,

monitor, statistically, included, those, reputed, to, practice, female, infanticide, prostitutes, lepers, and, eunuchs, murshid, argues, that, women, were, in, some, ways, more, restricted, by, the, modernisation, of, the, laws, they, remained, tied, to, the, strictures, of, their, religion, caste, and, customs, but, now, with, an, overlay, of, british, victorian, attitudes, their, inheritance, rights, to, own, and, manage, property, were, curtailed, the, new, english, laws, were, somewhat, harsher, court, rulings, restricted, the, rights, of, second, wives, and, their, children, regarding, inheritance, a, woman, had, to, belong, to, either, a, father, or, a, husband, to, have, any, rights, all, three, sectors, of, the, economy, agriculture, manufacturing, and, services, accelerated, in, the, postcolonial, india, in, agriculture, a, huge, increase, in, production, took, place, in, the, 1870s, the, most, important, difference, between, colonial, and, postcolonial, india, was, the, use, of, land, surplus, with, productivity, led, growth, by, using, high, yielding, variety, seeds, chemical, fertilizers, and, more, intensive, application, of, water, all, these, three, inputs, were, subsidised, by, the, state, the, result, was, on, average, no, long, term, change, in, per, capita, income, levels, though, cost, of, living, had, grown, higher, agriculture, was, still, dominant, with, most, peasants, at, the, subsistence, level, extensive, irrigation, systems, were, built, providing, an, impetus, for, switching, to, cash, crops, for, export, and, for, raw, materials, for, indian, industry, especially, jute, cotton, sugarcane, coffee, and, tea, india, s, global, share, of, gdp, fell, drastically, from, above, 20, to, less, than, 5, in, the, colonial, period, historians, have, been, bitterly, divided, on, issues, of, economic, history, with, the, nationalist, school, following, nehru, arguing, that, india, was, poorer, at, the, end, of, british, rule, than, at, the, beginning, and, that, impoverishment, occurred, because, of, the, british, mike, davis, writes, that, much, of, the, economic, activity, in, british, india, was, for, the, benefit, of, the, british, economy, and, was, carried, out, relentlessly, through, repressive, british, imperial, policies, and, with, negative, repercussions, for, the, indian, population, this, is, reified, in, india, s, large, exports, of, wheat, to, britain, despite, a, major, famine, that, claimed, between, 6, and, 10, million, lives, in, the, late, 1870s, these, exports, remained, unchecked, a, colonial, government, committed, to, laissez, faire, economics, refused, to, interfere, with, these, exports, or, provide, any, relief, with, the, end, of, the, state, granted, monopoly, of, the, east, india, trading, company, in, 1813, the, importation, into, india, of, british, manufactured, goods, including, finished, textiles, increased, dramatically, from, approximately, 1, million, yards, of, cotton, cloth, in, 1814, to, 13, million, in, 1820, 995, million, in, 1870, to, 2050, million, by, 1890, the, british, imposed, free, trade, on, india, while, continental, europe, and, the, united, states, erected, stiff, tariff, barriers, ranging, from, 30, to, 70, on, the, importation, of, cotton, yarn, or, prohibited, it, entirely, as, a, result, of, the, less, expensive, imports, from, more, industrialized, britain, india, s, most, significant, industrial, sector, textile, production, shrank, such, that, by, 1870, 1880, indian, producers, were, manufacturing, only, 25, 45, of, local, consumption, deindustrialization, of, india, s, iron, industry, was, even, more, extensive, during, this, period, the, entrepreneur, jamsetji, tata, 1839, 1904, began, his, industrial, career, in, 1877, with, the, central, india, spinning, weaving, and, manufacturing, company, in, bombay, while, other, indian, mills, produced, cheap, coarse, yarn, and, later, cloth, using, local, short, staple, cotton, and, cheap, machinery, imported, from, britain, tata, did, much, better, by, importing, expensive, longer, stapled, cotton, from, egypt, and, buying, more, complex, ring, spindle, machinery, from, the, united, states, to, spin, finer, yarn, that, could, compete, with, imports, from, britain, in, the, 1890s, he, launched, plans, to, move, into, heavy, industry, using, indian, funding, the, raj, did, not, provide, capital, but, aware, of, britain, s, declining, position, against, the, us, and, germany, in, the, steel, industry, it, wanted, steel, mills, in, india, it, promised, to, purchase, any, surplus, steel, tata, could, not, otherwise, sell, the, tata, iron, and, steel, company, tisco, now, headed, by, his, son, dorabji, tata, 1859, 1932, began, constructing, its, plant, at, jamshedpur, in, bihar, in, 1908, using, american, technology, not, british, according, to, the, oxford, dictionary, of, national, biography, tisco, became, the, leading, iron, and, steel, producer, in, india, and, a, symbol, of, indian, technical, skill, managerial, competence, and, entrepreneurial, flair, the, tata, family, like, most, of, india, s, big, businessmen, were, indian, nationalists, but, did, not, trust, the, congress, because, it, seemed, too, aggressively, hostile, to, the, raj, too, socialist, and, too, supportive, of, trade, unions, british, india, built, a, modern, railway, system, in, the, late, 19th, century, which, was, the, fourth, largest, in, the, world, at, first, the, railways, were, privately, owned, and, operated, they, were, run, by, british, administrators, engineers, and, craftsmen, at, first, only, the, unskilled, workers, were, indians, the, east, india, company, and, later, the, colonial, government, encouraged, new, railway, companies, backed, by, private, investors, under, a, scheme, that, would, provide, land, and, guarantee, an, annual, return, of, up, to, 5, during, the, initial, years, of, operation, the, companies, were, to, build, and, operate, the, lines, under, a, 99, year, lease, with, the, government, having, the, option, to, buy, them, earlier, two, new, railway, companies, the, great, indian, peninsular, railway, gipr, and, the, east, indian, railway, company, eir, began, to, construct, and, operate, lines, near, bombay, and, calcutta, in, 1853, 54, the, first, passenger, railway, line, in, north, india, between, allahabad, and, kanpur, opened, in, 1859, eventually, five, british, companies, came, to, own, all, railway, business, in, india, and, operated, under, a, profit, maximization, scheme, further, there, was, no, government, regulation, of, these, companies, in, 1854, governor, general, lord, dalhousie, formulated, a, plan, to, construct, a, network, of, trunk, lines, connecting, the, principal, regions, of, india, encouraged, by, the, government, guarantees, investment, flowed, in, and, a, series, of, new, rail, companies, was, established, leading, to, rapid, expansion, of, the, rail, system, in, india, soon, several, large, princely, states, built, their, own, rail, systems, and, the, network, spread, to, the, regions, that, became, the, modern, day, states, of, assam, rajasthan, and, andhra, pradesh, the, route, mileage, of, this, network, increased, from, 1, 349, to, 25, 495, kilometres, 838, to, 15, 842, mi, between, 1860, and, 1890, mostly, radiating, inland, from, the, three, major, port, cities, of, bombay, madras, and, calcutta, after, the, sepoy, rebellion, in, 1857, and, subsequent, crown, rule, over, india, the, railways, were, seen, as, a, strategic, defense, of, the, european, population, allowing, the, military, to, move, quickly, to, subdue, native, unrest, and, protect, britons, the, railway, thus, served, as, a, tool, of, the, colonial, government, to, control, india, as, they, were, an, essential, strategic, defensive, subjugators, and, administrative, tool, for, the, imperial, project, most, of, the, railway, construction, was, done, by, indian, companies, supervised, by, british, engineers, the, system, was, heavily, built, using, a, broad, gauge, sturdy, tracks, and, strong, bridges, by, 1900, india, had, a, full, range, of, rail, services, with, diverse, ownership, and, management, operating, on, broad, metre, and, narrow, gauge, networks, in, 1900, the, government, took, over, the, gipr, network, while, the, company, continued, to, manage, it, during, the, first, world, war, the, railways, were, used, to, transport, troops, and, grain, to, the, ports, of, bombay, and, karachi, en, route, to, britain, mesopotamia, and, east, africa, with, shipments, of, equipment, and, parts, from, britain, curtailed, maintenance, became, much, more, difficult, critical, workers, entered, the, army, workshops, were, converted, to, making, munitions, the, locomotives, rolling, stock, and, track, of, some, entire, lines, were, shipped, to, the, middle, east, the, railways, could, barely, keep, up, with, the, increased, demand, by, the, end, of, the, war, the, railways, had, deteriorated, for, lack, of, maintenance, and, were, not, profitable, in, 1923, both, gipr, and, eir, were, nationalised, headrick, shows, that, until, the, 1930s, both, the, raj, lines, and, the, private, companies, hired, only, european, supervisors, civil, engineers, and, even, operating, personnel, such, as, locomotive, engineers, the, hard, physical, labor, was, left, to, the, indians, the, colonial, government, was, chiefly, concerned, with, the, welfare, of, european, workers, and, any, indian, deaths, were, either, ignored, or, merely, mentioned, as, a, cold, statistical, figure, the, government, s, stores, policy, required, that, bids, on, railway, contracts, be, made, to, the, india, office, in, london, shutting, out, most, indian, firms, the, railway, companies, purchased, most, of, their, hardware, and, parts, in, britain, there, were, railway, maintenance, workshops, in, india, but, they, were, rarely, allowed, to, manufacture, or, repair, locomotives, after, independence, in, 1947, forty, two, separate, railway, systems, including, thirty, two, lines, owned, by, the, former, indian, princely, states, were, amalgamated, to, form, a, single, nationalised, unit, named, the, indian, railways, india, provides, an, example, of, the, british, empire, pouring, its, money, and, expertise, into, a, very, well, built, system, designed, for, military, purposes, after, the, rebellion, of, 1857, in, the, hope, that, it, would, stimulate, industry, the, system, was, overbuilt, and, too, expensive, for, the, small, amount, of, freight, traffic, it, carried, christensen, 1996, who, looked, at, colonial, purpose, local, needs, capital, service, and, private, versus, public, interests, concluded, that, making, the, railways, a, creature, of, the, state, hindered, success, because, railway, expenses, had, to, go, through, the, same, time, consuming, and, political, budgeting, process, as, did, all, other, state, expenses, railway, costs, could, therefore, not, be, tailored, to, the, current, needs, of, the, railways, or, of, their, passengers, the, british, raj, invested, heavily, in, infrastructure, including, canals, and, irrigation, systems, the, ganges, canal, reached, 560, kilometres, 350, miles, from, haridwar, to, cawnpore, now, kanpur, and, supplied, thousands, of, kilometres, of, distribution, canals, by, 1900, the, raj, had, the, largest, irrigation, system, in, the, world, one, success, story, was, assam, a, jungle, in, 1840, that, by, 1900, had, 1, 600, 000, hectares, 4, 000, 000, acres, under, cultivation, especially, in, tea, plantations, in, all, the, amount, of, irrigated, land, rose, eightfold, historian, david, gilmour, says, by, the, 1870s, the, peasantry, in, the, districts, irrigated, by, the, ganges, canal, were, visibly, better, fed, housed, and, dressed, than, before, by, the, end, of, the, century, the, new, network, of, canals, in, the, punjab, had, produced, an, even, more, prosperous, peasantry, there, in, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, both, the, direct, administration, of, india, by, the, british, crown, and, the, technological, change, ushered, in, by, the, industrial, revolution, had, the, effect, of, closely, intertwining, the, economies, of, india, and, great, britain, in, fact, many, of, the, major, changes, in, transport, and, communications, that, are, typically, associated, with, crown, rule, of, india, had, already, begun, before, the, rebellion, since, dalhousie, had, embraced, the, technological, revolution, underway, in, britain, india, too, saw, rapid, development, of, all, those, technologies, railways, roads, canals, and, bridges, were, rapidly, built, in, india, and, telegraph, links, equally, rapidly, established, so, that, raw, materials, such, as, cotton, from, india, s, hinterland, could, be, transported, more, efficiently, to, ports, such, as, bombay, for, subsequent, export, to, england, likewise, finished, goods, from, england, were, transported, back, just, as, efficiently, for, sale, in, the, burgeoning, indian, markets, massive, railway, projects, were, begun, in, earnest, and, government, railway, jobs, and, pensions, attracted, a, large, number, of, upper, caste, hindus, into, the, civil, services, for, the, first, time, the, indian, civil, service, was, prestigious, and, paid, well, it, remained, politically, neutral, imports, of, british, cotton, cloth, captured, more, than, half, the, indian, market, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, industrial, production, as, it, developed, in, european, factories, was, unknown, until, the, 1850s, when, the, first, cotton, mills, were, opened, in, bombay, posing, a, challenge, to, the, cottage, based, home, production, system, based, on, family, labour, taxes, in, india, decreased, during, the, colonial, period, for, most, of, india, s, population, with, the, land, tax, revenue, claiming, 15, of, india, s, national, income, during, mughal, times, compared, with, 1, at, the, end, of, the, colonial, period, the, percentage, of, national, income, for, the, village, economy, increased, from, 44, during, mughal, times, to, 54, by, the, end, of, colonial, period, india, s, per, capita, gdp, decreased, from, 1990, int, l, 550, in, 1700, to, 520, by, 1857, although, it, later, increased, to, 618, by, 1947, historians, continue, to, debate, whether, the, long, term, intention, of, british, rule, was, to, accelerate, the, economic, development, of, india, or, to, distort, and, delay, it, in, 1780, the, conservative, british, politician, edmund, burke, raised, the, issue, of, india, s, position, he, vehemently, attacked, the, east, india, company, claiming, that, warren, hastings, and, other, top, officials, had, ruined, the, indian, economy, and, society, indian, historian, rajat, kanta, ray, 1998, continues, this, line, of, attack, saying, the, new, economy, brought, by, the, british, in, the, 18th, century, was, a, form, of, plunder, and, a, catastrophe, for, the, traditional, economy, of, the, mughal, empire, ray, accuses, the, british, of, depleting, the, food, and, money, stocks, and, of, imposing, high, taxes, that, helped, cause, the, terrible, bengal, famine, of, 1770, which, killed, a, third, of, the, people, of, bengal, p, j, marshall, shows, that, recent, scholarship, has, reinterpreted, the, view, that, the, prosperity, of, the, formerly, benign, mughal, rule, gave, way, to, poverty, and, anarchy, he, argues, the, british, takeover, did, not, make, any, sharp, break, with, the, past, which, largely, delegated, control, to, regional, mughal, rulers, and, sustained, a, generally, prosperous, economy, for, the, rest, of, the, 18th, century, marshall, notes, the, british, went, into, partnership, with, indian, bankers, and, raised, revenue, through, local, tax, administrators, and, kept, the, old, mughal, rates, of, taxation, the, east, india, company, inherited, an, onerous, taxation, system, that, took, one, third, of, the, produce, of, indian, cultivators, instead, of, the, indian, nationalist, account, of, the, british, as, alien, aggressors, seizing, power, by, brute, force, and, impoverishing, all, of, india, marshall, presents, the, interpretation, supported, by, many, scholars, in, india, and, the, west, that, the, british, were, not, in, full, control, but, instead, were, players, in, what, was, primarily, an, indian, play, and, in, which, their, rise, to, power, depended, upon, excellent, co, operation, with, indian, elites, marshall, admits, that, much, of, his, interpretation, is, still, highly, controversial, among, many, historians, studies, suggest, that, from, 1765, to, 1938, around, 45, trillion, was, stolen, by, the, british, as, a, result, of, their, direct, control, of, india, the, population, of, the, territory, that, became, the, british, raj, was, 100, million, by, 1600, and, remained, nearly, stationary, until, the, 19th, century, the, population, of, the, raj, reached, 255, million, according, to, the, first, census, taken, in, 1881, of, india, studies, of, india, s, population, since, 1881, have, focused, on, such, topics, as, total, population, birth, and, death, rates, growth, rates, geographic, distribution, literacy, the, rural, and, urban, divide, cities, of, a, million, and, the, three, cities, with, populations, over, eight, million, delhi, greater, bombay, and, calcutta, mortality, rates, fell, in, the, 1920, 1945, era, primarily, due, to, biological, immunisation, other, factors, included, rising, incomes, and, better, living, conditions, improved, nutrition, a, safer, and, cleaner, environment, and, better, official, health, policies, and, medical, care, severe, overcrowding, in, the, cities, caused, major, public, health, problems, as, noted, in, an, official, report, from, 1938, during, the, british, raj, india, experienced, some, of, the, worst, famines, ever, recorded, including, the, great, famine, of, 1876, 1878, in, which, 6, 1, million, to, 10, 39, million, indians, perished, and, the, indian, famine, of, 1899, 1900, in, which, 1, 25, to, 10, million, indians, perished, recent, research, including, work, by, mike, davis, and, amartya, sen, argue, that, famines, in, india, were, made, more, severe, by, british, policies, in, india, the, first, cholera, pandemic, began, in, bengal, then, spread, across, india, by, 1820, ten, thousand, british, troops, and, countless, indians, died, during, this, pandemic, estimated, deaths, in, india, between, 1817, and, 1860, exceeded, 15, million, another, 23, million, died, between, 1865, and, 1917, the, third, plague, pandemic, which, started, in, china, in, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, eventually, spread, to, all, inhabited, continents, and, killed, 10, million, indians, in, india, alone, waldemar, haffkine, who, mainly, worked, in, india, became, the, first, microbiologist, to, develop, and, deploy, vaccines, against, cholera, and, bubonic, plague, in, 1925, the, plague, laboratory, in, bombay, was, renamed, the, haffkine, institute, fevers, ranked, as, one, of, the, leading, causes, of, death, in, india, in, the, 19th, century, britain, s, sir, ronald, ross, working, in, the, presidency, general, hospital, in, calcutta, finally, proved, in, 1898, that, mosquitoes, transmit, malaria, while, on, assignment, in, the, deccan, at, secunderabad, where, the, centre, for, tropical, and, communicable, diseases, is, now, named, in, his, honour, in, 1881, there, were, around, 120, 000, leprosy, patients, the, central, government, passed, the, lepers, act, of, 1898, which, provided, legal, provision, for,

medical, knowledge, to, the, natives, in, 1860, grant, medical, college, became, one, of, the, four, recognised, colleges, for, teaching, courses, leading, to, degrees, alongside, elphinstone, college, deccan, college, and, government, law, college, mumbai, this, is, the, list, of, civilian, massacre, of, indians, in, most, cases, unarmed, peaceful, crowds, by, the, army, thomas, babington, macaulay, 1800, 1859, presented, his, whiggish, interpretation, of, english, history, as, an, upward, progression, always, leading, to, more, liberty, and, more, progress, macaulay, simultaneously, was, a, leading, reformer, involved, in, transforming, the, educational, system, of, india, he, would, base, it, on, the, english, language, so, that, india, could, join, the, mother, country, in, a, steady, upward, progress, macaulay, took, burke, s, emphasis, on, moral, rule, and, implemented, it, in, actual, school, reforms, giving, the, british, empire, a, profound, moral, mission, to, civilise, the, natives, yale, professor, karuna, mantena, has, argued, that, the, civilising, mission, did, not, last, long, for, she, says, that, benevolent, reformers, were, the, losers, in, key, debates, such, as, those, following, the, 1857, rebellion, in, india, and, the, scandal, of, edward, eyre, s, brutal, repression, of, the, morant, bay, rebellion, in, jamaica, in, 1865, the, rhetoric, continued, but, it, became, an, alibi, for, british, misrule, and, racism, no, longer, was, it, believed, that, the, natives, could, truly, make, progress, instead, they, had, to, be, ruled, by, heavy, hand, with, democratic, opportunities, postponed, indefinitely, as, a, result, the, central, tenets, of, liberal, imperialism, were, challenged, as, various, forms, of, rebellion, resistance, and, instability, in, the, colonies, precipitated, a, broad, ranging, reassessment, the, equation, of, good, government, with, the, reform, of, native, society, which, was, at, the, core, of, the, discourse, of, liberal, empire, would, be, subject, to, mounting, scepticism, english, historian, peter, cain, has, challenged, mantena, arguing, that, the, imperialists, truly, believed, that, british, rule, would, bring, to, the, subjects, the, benefits, of, ordered, liberty, thereby, britain, could, fulfil, its, moral, duty, and, achieve, its, own, greatness, much, of, the, debate, took, place, in, britain, itself, and, the, imperialists, worked, hard, to, convince, the, general, population, that, the, civilising, mission, was, well, under, way, this, campaign, served, to, strengthen, imperial, support, at, home, and, thus, says, cain, to, bolster, the, moral, authority, of, the, gentlemanly, elites, who, ran, the, empire, universities, in, calcutta, bombay, and, madras, were, established, in, 1857, just, before, the, rebellion, by, 1890, some, 60, 000, indians, had, matriculated, chiefly, in, the, liberal, arts, or, law, about, a, third, entered, public, administration,

000, students, over, 90, men, by, 1939, the, number, of, institutions, had, doubled, and, enrolment, reached, 145, 000, the, curriculum, followed, classical, british, standards, of, the, sort, set, by, oxford, and, cambridge, and, stressed, english, literature, and, european, history, nevertheless, by, the, 1920s, the, student, bodies, had, become, hotbeds, of, indian, nationalism, in, 1889, the, prime, minister, of, the, united, kingdom, robert, gascoyne, cecil, 3rd, marquess, of, salisbury, stated, it, is, not, only, our, duty, but, is, in, our, interest, to, promote, the, diffusion, of, christianity, as, far, as, possible, throughout, the, length, and, breadth, of, india, the, growth, of, the, british, indian, army, led, to, the, arrival, of, many, anglican, chaplains, in, india, following, the, arrival, of, the, church, of, england, s, church, mission, society, in, 1814, the, diocese, of, calcutta, of, the, church, of, india, burma, and, ceylon, cibc, was, erected, with, its, st, paul, s, cathedral, being, built, in, 1847, by, 1930, the, church, of, india, burma, and, ceylon, had, fourteen, dioceses, across, the, indian, empire, missionaries, from, other, christian, denominations, came, to, british, india, as, well, lutheran, missionaries, for, example, arrived, in, calcutta, in, 1836, and, by, the, year, 1880, there, were, over, 31, 200, lutheran, christians, spread, out, in, 1, 052, villages, methodists, began, arriving, in, india, in, 1783, and, established, missions, with, a, focus, on, education, health, ministry, and, evangelism, in, the, 1790s,

in, social, activism, such, as, fighting, against, prostitution, championing, the, right, of, widowed, women, to, remarry, and, trying, to, stop, early, marriages, for, women, among, british, women, zenana, missions, became, a, popular, method, to, win, converts, to, christianity, the, old, consensus, among, historians, held, that, british, imperial, authority, was, quite, secure, from, 1858, to, world, war, ii, recently, however, this, interpretation, has, been, challenged, for, example, mark, condos, and, jon, wilson, argue, that, imperial, authority, was, chronically, insecure, indeed, the, anxiety, of, generations, of, officials, produced, a, chaotic, administration, with, minimal, coherence, instead, of, a, confident, state, capable, of, acting, as, it, chose, these, historians, find, a, psychologically, embattled, one, incapable, of, acting, except, in, the, abstract, small, scale, or, short, term, meanwhile, durba, ghosh, offers, an, alternative, approach, at, independence, and, after, the, independence, of, india, the, country, has, maintained, such, central, british, institutions, as, parliamentary, government, one, person, one, vote, and, the, rule, of, law, through, nonpartisan, courts, it, retained, as, well, the, institutional, arrangements, of, the, raj, such, as, the, civil, services, administration, of, sub, divisions, universities, and, stock, exchanges, one, major, change, was, the, rejection, of, its, former, separate, princely, states, metcalf, shows, that, over, the, course, of, two, centuries, british, intellectuals, and, indian, specialists, made, the, highest, priority, bringing, peace, unity, and, good, government, to, india, they, offered, many, competing, methods, to, reach, the, goal, for, example, cornwallis, recommended, turning, bengali, zamindar, into, the, sort, of, english, landlords, that, controlled, local, affairs, in, england, munro, proposed, to, deal, directly, with, the, peasants, sir, william, jones, and, the, orientalists, promoted, sanskrit, while, macaulay, promoted, the, english, language, zinkin, argues, that, in, the, long, run, what, matters, most, about, the, legacy, of, the, raj, is, the, british, political, ideologies, which, the, indians, took, over, after, 1947, especially, the, belief, in, unity, democracy, the, rule, of, law, and, a, certain, equality, beyond, caste, and, creed, zinkin, sees, this, not, just, in, the, congress, party, but, also, among, hindu, nationalists, in, the, bharatiya, janata, party, which, specifically, emphasises, hindu, traditions, the, british, colonisation, of, india, influenced, south, asian, culture, noticeably, the, most, noticeable, influence, is, the, english, language, which, emerged, as, the, administrative, and, lingua, franca, of, india, and, pakistan, and, which, also, greatly, influenced, the, native, south, asian, languages, followed, by, the, blend, of, native, and, gothic, sarcenic, architecture, similarly, the, influence, of, the, south, asian, languages, and, culture, can, be, seen, on, britain, too, for, example, many, indian, words, entering, the, english, language, and, also, the, adoption, of, south, asian, cuisine, british, sports, particularly, hockey, early, on, but, then, largely, replaced, by, cricket, in, recent, decades, with, football, also, popular, in, certain, regions, of, the, subcontinent, were, cemented, as, part, of, south, asian, culture, during, the, british, raj, with, the, local, games, largely, having, been, diminished, in, the, process, during, the, raj, soldiers, would, play, british, sports, as, a, way, of, maintaining, fitness, since, the, mortality, rate, for, foreigners, in, india, was, high, at, the, time, as, well, as, to, maintain, a, sense, of, britishness, in, the, words, of, an, anonymous, writer, playing, british, sports, was, a, way, for, soldiers, to, defend, themselves, from, the, magic, of, the, land, though, the, british, had, generally, excluded, indians, from, their, play, during, the, time, of, company, rule, over, time, they, began, to, see, the, inculcation, of, british, sports, among, the, native, populace, as, a, way, of, spreading, british, values, at, the, same, time, some, of, the, indian, elite, began, to, move, towards, british, sports, as, a, way, of, adapting, to, british, culture, and, thus, helping, themselves, to, rise, up, the, ranks, later, on, more, indians, began, to, play, british, sports, in, an, effort, to, beat, the, british, at, their, own, sports, as, a, way, of, proving, that, the, indians, were, equal,
