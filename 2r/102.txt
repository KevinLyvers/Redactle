the, ancestral, puebloans, also, known, as, the, anasazi, and, by, the, earlier, term, the, bastketmaker, pueblo, culture, were, an, ancient, native, american, culture, that, spanned, the, present, day, four, corners, region, of, the, united, states, comprising, southeastern, utah, northeastern, arizona, northwestern, new, mexico, and, southwestern, colorado, they, are, believed, to, have, developed, at, least, in, part, from, the, oshara, tradition, which, developed, from, the, picosa, culture, the, people, and, their, archaeological, culture, are, often, referred, to, as, anasazi, a, term, introduced, by, alfred, v, kidder, from, the, navajo, word, anaas, z, meaning, enemy, ancestors, anaa, enemy, s, z, their, ancestors, although, kidder, thought, it, meant, old, people, contemporary, puebloans, object, to, the, use, of, this, term, with, some, viewing, it, as, derogatory, the, ancestral, puebloans, lived, in, a, range, of, structures, that, included, small, family, pit, houses, larger, structures, to, house, clans, grand, pueblos, and, cliff, sited, dwellings, for, defense, they, had, a, complex, network, linking, hundreds, of, communities, and, population, centers, across, the, colorado, plateau, they, held, a, distinct, knowledge, of, celestial, sciences, that, found, form, in, their, architecture, the, kiva, a, congregational, space, that, was, used, mostly, for, ceremonies, was, an, integral, part, of, the, community, structure, archaeologists, continue, to, debate, when, this, distinct, culture, emerged, the, current, agreement, based, on, terminology, defined, by, the, pecos, classification, suggests, their, emergence, around, the, 12th, century, bce, during, the, archaeologically, designated, early, basketmaker, ii, era, beginning, with, the, earliest, explorations, and, excavations, researchers, identified, ancestral, puebloans, as, the, forerunners, of, contemporary, pueblo, peoples, although, specific, site, to, modern, group, connections, are, unclear, three, unesco, world, heritage, sites, located, in, the, united, states, are, credited, to, the, pueblos, mesa, verde, national, park, chaco, culture, national, historical, park, and, taos, pueblo, pueblo, which, means, village, and, people, in, spanish, was, a, term, originating, with, the, spanish, explorers, who, used, it, to, refer, to, the, people, s, particular, style, of, dwelling, the, navajo, people, who, now, reside, in, parts, of, former, pueblo, territory, referred, to, the, ancient, people, as, anaas, z, an, exonym, meaning, ancestors, of, our, enemies, referring, to, their, competition, with, the, pueblo, peoples, the, navajo, now, use, the, term, in, the, sense, of, referring, to, ancient, people, or, ancient, ones, whereas, others, ascribe, the, meaning, of, anasazi, to, those, who, are, different, from, our, people, lit, ana, different, from, us, asaza, the, old, ones, hopi, people, use, the, term, hisatsinom, meaning, ancient, people, to, describe, the, ancestral, puebloans, the, ancestral, puebloans, were, one, of, four, major, prehistoric, archaeological, traditions, recognized, in, the, american, southwest, also, known, as, oasisamerica, the, others, are, the, mogollon, hohokam, and, patayan, in, relation, to, neighboring, cultures, the, ancestral, puebloans, occupied, the, northeast, quadrant, of, the, area, the, ancestral, puebloan, homeland, centers, on, the, colorado, plateau, but, extends, from, central, new, mexico, on, the, east, to, southern, nevada, on, the, west, areas, of, southern, nevada, utah, and, colorado, form, a, loose, northern, boundary, while, the, southern, edge, is, defined, by, the, colorado, and, little, colorado, rivers, in, arizona, and, the, rio, puerco, and, rio, grande, in, new, mexico, structures, and, other, evidence, of, ancestral, puebloan, culture, have, been, found, extending, east, onto, the, american, great, plains, in, areas, near, the, cimarron, and, pecos, rivers, and, in, the, galisteo, basin, terrain, and, resources, within, this, large, region, vary, greatly, the, plateau, regions, have, high, elevations, ranging, from, 4, 500, to, 8, 500, feet, 1, 400, to, 2, 600, m, extensive, horizontal, mesas, are, capped, by, sedimentary, formations, and, support, woodlands, of, junipers, pinyon, and, ponderosa, pines, each, favoring, different, elevations, wind, and, water, erosion, have, created, steep, walled, canyons, and, sculpted, windows, and, bridges, out, of, the, sandstone, landscape, in, areas, where, resistant, strata, sedimentary, rock, layers, such, as, sandstone, or, limestone, overlie, more, easily, eroded, strata, such, as, shale, rock, overhangs, formed, the, ancestral, puebloans, favored, building, under, such, overhangs, for, shelters, and, defensive, building, sites, all, areas, of, the, ancestral, puebloan, homeland, suffered, from, periods, of, drought, and, erosion, from, wind, and, water, summer, rains, could, be, unreliable, and, produced, destructive, thunderstorms, while, the, amount, of, winter, snowfall, varied, greatly, the, ancestral, puebloans, depended, on, the, snow, for, most, of, their, water, snow, melt, allowed, the, germination, of, seeds, both, wild, and, cultivated, in, the, spring, where, sandstone, layers, overlay, shale, snow, melt, could, accumulate, and, create, seeps, and, springs, which, the, ancestral, puebloans, used, as, water, sources, snow, also, fed, the, smaller, more, predictable, tributaries, such, as, the, chinle, animas, jemez, and, taos, rivers, the, larger, rivers, were, less, directly, important, to, the, ancient, culture, as, smaller, streams, were, more, easily, diverted, or, controlled, for, irrigation, the, ancestral, puebloan, culture, is, perhaps, best, known, for, the, stone, and, earth, dwellings, its, people, built, along, cliff, walls, particularly, during, the, pueblo, ii, and, pueblo, iii, eras, from, about, 900, to, 1350, ce, in, total, the, best, preserved, examples, of, the, stone, dwellings, are, now, protected, within, united, states, national, parks, such, as, navajo, national, monument, chaco, culture, national, historical, park, mesa, verde, national, park, canyons, of, the, ancients, national, monument, aztec, ruins, national, monument, bandelier, national, monument, hovenweep, national, monument, and, canyon, de, chelly, national, monument, these, villages, called, pueblos, by, spanish, colonists, were, accessible, only, by, rope, or, through, rock, climbing, these, astonishing, building, achievements, had, modest, beginnings, the, first, ancestral, puebloan, homes, and, villages, were, based, on, the, pit, house, a, common, feature, in, the, basketmaker, periods, ancestral, puebloans, are, also, known, for, their, pottery, local, plainware, pottery, used, for, cooking, or, storage, was, unpainted, gray, either, smooth, or, textured, pottery, used, for, more, formal, purposes, was, often, more, richly, adorned, in, the, northern, portion, of, the, ancestral, pueblo, lands, from, about, 500, to, 1300, ce, the, pottery, styles, commonly, had, black, painted, designs, on, white, or, light, gray, backgrounds, decoration, is, characterized, by, fine, hatching, and, contrasting, colors, are, produced, by, the, use, of, mineral, based, paint, on, a, chalky, background, south, of, the, anasazi, territory, in, mogollon, settlements, pottery, was, more, often, hand, coiled, scraped, and, polished, with, red, to, brown, coloring, certain, tall, cylinders, were, likely, ceremonial, vessels, while, narrow, necked, jars, called, ollas, were, often, used, for, liquids, pottery, from, the, southern, regions, of, ancestral, pueblo, lands, has, bold, black, line, decoration, and, the, use, of, carbon, based, colorants, in, northern, new, mexico, the, local, black, on, white, pottery, tradition, the, rio, grande, white, wares, continued, well, after, 1300, ce, changes, in, pottery, composition, structure, and, decoration, are, signals, of, social, change, in, the, archaeological, record, this, is, particularly, true, as, the, peoples, of, the, american, southwest, began, to, leave, their, historic, homes, and, migrate, south, according, to, archaeologists, patricia, crown, and, steadman, upham, the, appearance, of, the, bright, colors, on, salado, polychromes, in, the, 14th, century, may, reflect, religious, or, political, alliances, on, a, regional, level, late, 14th, and, 15th, century, pottery, from, central, arizona, widely, traded, in, the, region, has, colors, and, designs, which, may, derive, from, earlier, ware, by, both, ancestral, pueblo, and, mogollon, peoples, the, ancestral, puebloans, also, excelled, at, rock, art, which, included, carved, petroglyphs, and, painted, pictographs, ancestral, pueblo, peoples, painted, barrier, canyon, style, pictographs, in, locations, where, the, images, were, protected, from, the, sun, yet, visible, to, the, public, designs, include, human, like, forms, the, so, called, holy, ghost, panel, in, the, horseshoe, canyon, is, considered, to, be, one, of, the, earliest, uses, of, graphical, perspective, where, the, largest, figure, appears, to, take, on, a, three, dimensional, representation, recent, archaeological, evidence, has, established, that, in, at, least, one, great, house, pueblo, bonito, the, elite, family, whose, burials, associate, them, with, the, site, practiced, matrilineal, succession, room, 33, in, pueblo, bonito, the, richest, burial, ever, excavated, in, the, southwest, served, as, a, crypt, for, one, powerful, lineage, traced, through, the, female, line, for, approximately, 330, years, while, other, ancestral, pueblo, burials, have, not, yet, been, subjected, to, the, same, archaeogenomic, testing, the, survival, of, matrilineal, descent, among, contemporary, pueblo, peoples, suggests, that, this, may, have, been, a, widespread, practice, among, ancestral, puebloans, ancestral, pueblo, people, in, the, north, american, southwest, crafted, a, unique, architecture, with, planned, community, spaces, population, centers, such, as, chaco, canyon, outside, crownpoint, new, mexico, mesa, verde, near, cortez, colorado, and, bandelier, national, monument, near, los, alamos, new, mexico, have, brought, renown, to, the, ancestral, pueblo, peoples, they, consisted, of, apartment, complexes, and, structures, made, of, stone, adobe, mud, and, other, local, material, or, were, carved, into, canyon, walls, developed, within, these, cultures, the, people, also, adopted, design, details, from, other, cultures, as, far, away, as, contemporary, mexico, these, buildings, were, usually, multistoried, and, multipurposed, and, surrounded, by, open, plazas, and, viewsheds, hundreds, to, thousands, of, people, lived, in, these, communities, these, complexes, hosted, cultural, and, civic, events, and, infrastructure, that, supported, a, vast, outlying, region, hundreds, of, miles, away, linked, by, transportation, roadways, built, well, before, 1492, ce, these, towns, and, villages, were, located, in, defensive, positions, for, example, on, high, steep, mesas, such, as, at, mesa, verde, or, present, day, acoma, pueblo, called, the, sky, city, in, new, mexico, before, 900, ce, and, progressing, past, the, 13th, century, the, population, complexes, were, major, cultural, centers, in, chaco, canyon, chacoan, developers, quarried, sandstone, blocks, and, hauled, timber, from, great, distances, assembling, 15, major, complexes, these, ranked, as, the, largest, buildings, in, north, america, until, the, late, 19th, century, evidence, of, archaeoastronomy, at, chaco, has, been, proposed, with, the, sun, dagger, petroglyph, at, fajada, butte, a, popular, example, many, chacoan, buildings, may, have, been, aligned, to, capture, the, solar, and, lunar, cycles, requiring, generations, of, astronomical, observations, and, centuries, of, skillfully, coordinated, construction, the, chacoans, abandoned, the, canyon, probably, due, to, climate, change, beginning, with, a, 50, year, drought, starting, in, 1130, immense, complexes, known, as, great, houses, embodied, worship, at, chaco, archaeologists, have, found, musical, instruments, jewelry, ceramics, and, ceremonial, items, indicating, people, in, the, great, houses, were, elite, wealthier, families, they, hosted, indoor, burials, where, gifts, were, interred, with, the, dead, often, including, bowls, of, food, and, turquoise, beads, over, centuries, architectural, forms, evolved, but, the, complexes, kept, some, core, traits, such, as, their, size, they, averaged, more, than, 200, rooms, each, and, some, had, 700, rooms, rooms, were, very, large, with, higher, ceilings, than, ancestral, pueblo, buildings, of, earlier, periods, they, were, well, planned, vast, sections, were, built, in, a, single, stage, most, houses, faced, south, plazas, were, almost, always, surrounded, by, buildings, of, sealed, off, rooms, or, high, walls, there, were, often, four, or, five, stories, with, single, story, rooms, facing, the, plaza, room, blocks, were, terraced, to, allow, the, tallest, sections, to, compose, the, pueblo, s, rear, edifice, rooms, were, often, organized, into, suites, with, front, rooms, larger, than, rear, interior, and, storage, rooms, or, areas, ceremonial, structures, known, as, kivas, were, built, in, proportion, to, the, number, of, rooms, in, a, pueblo, a, small, kiva, was, built, for, roughly, every, 29, rooms, nine, complexes, each, had, a, great, kiva, up, to, 63, feet, 19, m, in, diameter, t, shaped, doorways, and, stone, lintels, marked, all, chacoan, kivas, although, simple, and, compound, walls, were, often, used, great, houses, usually, had, core, and, veneer, walls, rubble, filled, the, gap, between, parallel, load, bearing, walls, of, dressed, flat, sandstone, blocks, bound, in, clay, mortar, walls, were, covered, in, a, veneer, of, small, sandstone, pieces, which, were, pressed, into, a, layer, of, binding, mud, these, surfacing, stones, were, often, arranged, in, distinctive, patterns, the, chacoan, structures, together, required, the, wood, of, 200, 000, conifer, trees, mostly, hauled, on, foot, from, mountain, ranges, up, to, 70, miles, 110, km, away, one, of, the, most, notable, aspects, of, ancestral, puebloan, infrastructure, is, the, chaco, road, at, chaco, canyon, a, system, of, roads, radiating, from, many, great, house, sites, such, as, pueblo, bonito, chetro, ketl, and, una, vida, they, led, toward, small, outlier, sites, and, natural, features, in, the, canyon, and, outside, through, satellite, images, and, ground, investigations, archaeologists, have, found, eight, main, roads, that, together, run, for, more, than, 180, miles, 300, km, and, are, more, than, 30, feet, 10, m, wide, these, were, built, by, excavating, into, a, smooth, leveled, surface, in, the, bedrock, or, removing, vegetation, and, soil, large, ramps, and, stairways, in, the, cliff, rock, connect, the, roads, above, the, canyon, to, sites, at, the, bottom, the, largest, roads, built, at, the, same, time, as, many, of, the, great, houses, 1000, to, 1125, ce, are, the, great, north, road, the, south, road, the, coyote, canyon, road, the, chacra, face, road, ahshislepah, road, mexican, springs, road, the, west, road, and, the, shorter, pintado, chaco, road, simple, structures, like, berms, and, walls, are, sometimes, aligned, along, the, roads, some, tracts, of, the, roads, lead, to, natural, features, such, as, springs, lakes, mountain, tops, and, pinnacles, the, longest, and, best, known, of, these, roads, is, the, great, north, road, which, originates, from, different, routes, close, to, pueblo, bonito, and, chetro, ketl, these, roads, converge, at, pueblo, alto, and, from, there, lead, north, beyond, the, canyon, limits, along, roadways, were, only, small, isolated, structures, archaeological, interpretations, of, the, chaco, road, system, are, divided, between, an, economic, purpose, and, a, symbolic, ideological, or, religious, role, the, system, was, discovered, in, the, late, 19th, century, and, excavated, in, the, 1970s, by, the, late, 20th, century, aerial, and, satellite, photographs, helped, in, the, study, archaeologists, suggested, that, the, road, s, main, purpose, was, to, transport, local, and, exotic, goods, to, and, from, the, canyon, the, economic, purpose, of, the, chaco, road, system, is, shown, by, the, presence, of, luxury, items, at, pueblo, bonito, and, elsewhere, in, the, canyon, items, such, as, macaws, turquoise, and, seashells, which, are, not, part, of, this, environment, and, imported, vessels, distinguished, by, design, prove, that, the, chaco, traded, with, distant, regions, the, widespread, use, of, timber, in, chacoan, constructions, required, a, large, system, of, easy, transportation, as, timber, was, not, locally, available, analysis, of, strontium, isotopes, shows, that, much, of, the, timber, came, from, distant, mountain, ranges, throughout, the, southwest, ancestral, puebloan, region, the, inhabitants, built, complexes, in, shallow, caves, and, under, rock, overhangs, in, canyon, walls, unlike, earlier, structures, and, villages, atop, mesas, this, was, a, regional, 13th, century, trend, of, gathering, the, growing, populations, into, close, defensible, quarters, there, were, buildings, for, housing, defense, and, storage, these, were, built, mostly, of, blocks, of, hard, sandstone, held, together, and, plastered, with, adobe, mortar, constructions, had, many, similarities, but, unique, forms, due, to, the, unique, rock, topography, the, best, known, site, is, at, mesa, verde, with, a, large, number, of, well, preserved, cliff, dwellings, this, area, included, common, pueblo, architectural, forms, such, as, kivas, towers, and, pit, houses, but, the, space, restrictions, of, these, alcoves, resulted, in, far, denser, populations, mug, house, a, typical, cliff, dwelling, of, the, period, was, home, to, around, 100, people, who, shared, 94, small, rooms, and, eight, kivas, built, right, up, against, each, other, and, sharing, many, walls, builders, maximized, space, use, and, no, area, was, off, limits, not, all, the, people, in, the, region, lived, in, cliff, dwellings, many, colonized, the, canyon, rims, and, slopes, in, multifamily, structures, that, grew, to, unprecedented, size, as, populations, swelled, decorative, motifs, for, these, sandstone, mortar, structures, both, cliff, dwellings, and, not, included, t, shaped, windows, and, doors, this, has, been, taken, by, some, archaeologists, such, as, stephen, lekson, 1999, as, evidence, of, the, continuation, of, the, chaco, canyon, elite, system, which, had, seemingly, collapsed, a, century, earlier, other, researchers, instead, explain, these, motifs, as, part, a, wider, pueblo, style, or, religion, during, the, period, from, 700, to, 1130, ce, pueblo, i, and, ii, eras, the, population, grew, fast, due, to, consistent, and, regular, rainfall, which, supported, agriculture, studies, of, skeletal, remains, show, increased, fertility, rather, than, decreased, mortality, however, this, tenfold, population, increase, over, a, few, generations, was, probably, also, due, to, migrations, of, people, from, surrounding, areas, innovations, such, as, pottery, food, storage, and, agriculture, enabled, this, rapid, growth, over, several, decades, the, ancestral, puebloan, culture, spread, across, the, landscape, ancestral, puebloan, culture, has, been, divided, into, three, main, areas, or, branches, based, on, geographical, location, modern, pueblo, oral, traditions, hold, that, the, ancestral, puebloans, originated, from, sipapu, where, they, emerged, from, the, underworld, for, unknown, ages, they, were, led, by, chiefs, and, guided, by, spirits, as, they, completed, vast, migrations, throughout, the, continent, of, north, america, they, settled, first, in, the, ancestral, puebloan, areas, for, a, few, hundred, years, before, moving, to, their, present, locations, the, ancestral, puebloans, left, their, established, homes, in, the, 12th, and, 13th, centuries, the, main, reason, is, unclear, factors, discussed, include, global, or, regional, climate, change, prolonged, drought, environmental, degradation, such, as, cyclical, periods, of, topsoil, erosion, or, deforestation, hostility, from, new, arrivals, religious, or, cultural, change, and, influence, from, mesoamerican, cultures, many, of, these, possibilities, are, supported, by, archaeological, evidence, current, scholarly, consensus, is, that, ancestral, puebloans, responded, to, pressure, from, numic, speaking, peoples, moving, onto, the, colorado, plateau, as, well, as, climate, change, that, resulted, in, agricultural, failures, the, archaeological, record, indicates, that, for, ancestral, puebloans, to, adapt, to, climatic, change, by, changing, residences, and, locations, was, not, unusual, early, pueblo, i, era, sites, may, have, housed, up, to, 600, individuals, in, a, few, separate, but, closely, spaced, settlement, clusters, however, they, were, generally, occupied, for, 30, years, or, less, archaeologist, timothy, a, kohler, excavated, large, pueblo, i, sites, near, dolores, colorado, and, discovered, that, they, were, established, during, periods, of, above, average, rainfall, this, allowed, crops, to, be, grown, without, requiring, irrigation, at, the, same, time, nearby, areas, that, suffered, significantly, drier, patterns, were, abandoned, ancestral, puebloans, attained, a, cultural, golden, age, between, about, 900, and, 1150, during, this, time, generally, classed, as, pueblo, ii, era, the, climate, was, relatively, warm, and, rainfall, mostly, adequate, communities, grew, larger, and, were, inhabited, for, longer, highly, specific, local, traditions, in, architecture, and, pottery, emerged, and, trade, over, long, distances, appears, to, have, been, common, domesticated, turkeys, appeared, after, around, 1130, north, america, had, significant, climatic, change, in, the, form, of, a, 300, year, period, of, aridity, called, the, great, drought, this, also, led, to, the, collapse, of, the, tiwanaku, civilization, around, lake, titicaca, in, present, day, bolivia, the, contemporary, mississippian, culture, also, collapsed, during, this, period, confirming, evidence, dated, between, 1150, and, 1350, has, been, found, in, excavations, of, the, western, regions, of, the, mississippi, valley, which, show, long, lasting, patterns, of, warmer, wetter, winters, and, cooler, drier, summers, in, this, later, period, the, pueblo, ii, became, more, self, contained, decreasing, trade, and, interaction, with, more, distant, communities, southwest, farmers, developed, irrigation, techniques, appropriate, to, seasonal, rainfall, including, soil, and, water, control, features, such, as, check, dams, and, terraces, the, population, of, the, region, continued, to, be, mobile, abandoning, settlements, and, fields, under, adverse, conditions, there, was, also, a, drop, in, water, table, due, to, a, different, cycle, unrelated, to, rainfall, this, forced, the, abandonment, of, settlements, in, the, more, arid, or, overfarmed, locations, evidence, suggests, a, profound, change, in, religion, in, this, period, chacoan, and, other, structures, constructed, originally, along, astronomical, alignments, and, thought, to, have, served, important, ceremonial, purposes, to, the, culture, were, systematically, dismantled, doorways, were, sealed, with, rock, and, mortar, kiva, walls, show, marks, from, great, fires, set, within, them, which, probably, required, removal, of, the, massive, roof, a, task, which, would, require, significant, effort, habitations, were, abandoned, and, tribes, divided, and, resettled, far, this, evidence, suggests, that, the, religious, structures, were, abandoned, deliberately, over, time, pueblo, oral, history, holds, that, the, ancestors, had, achieved, great, spiritual, power, and, control, over, natural, forces, they, used, their, power, in, ways, that, caused, nature, to, change, and, caused, changes, that, were, never, meant, to, occur, possibly, the, dismantling, of, their, religious, structures, was, an, effort, to, symbolically, undo, the, changes, they, believed, they, caused, due, to, their, abuse, of, their, spiritual, power, and, thus, make, amends, with, nature, most, modern, pueblo, peoples, whether, keresans, hopi, or, tanoans, assert, the, ancestral, puebloans, did, not, vanish, as, is, commonly, portrayed, they, say, that, the, people, migrated, to, areas, in, the, southwest, with, more, favorable, rainfall, and, dependable, streams, they, merged, into, the, various, pueblo, peoples, whose, descendants, still, live, in, arizona, and, new, mexico, this, perspective, was, also, presented, by, early, 20th, century, anthropologists, including, frank, hamilton, cushing, j, walter, fewkes, and, alfred, v, kidder, many, modern, pueblo, tribes, trace, their, lineage, from, specific, settlements, for, example, the, san, ildefonso, pueblo, people, believe, that, their, ancestors, lived, in, both, the, mesa, verde, and, the, bandelier, areas, evidence, also, suggests, that, a, profound, change, took, place, in, the, ancestral, pueblo, area, and, areas, inhabited, by, their, cultural, neighbors, the, mogollon, historian, james, w, loewen, agrees, with, this, oral, tradition, in, his, book, lies, across, america, what, our, historic, markers, and, monuments, get, wrong, 1999, no, academic, consensus, exists, with, the, professional, archeological, and, anthropological, community, on, this, issue, environmental, stress, may, have, caused, changes, in, social, structure, leading, to, conflict, and, warfare, near, kayenta, arizona, jonathan, haas, of, the, field, museum, in, chicago, has, been, studying, a, group, of, ancestral, puebloan, villages, that, relocated, from, the, canyons, to, the, high, mesa, tops, during, the, late, 13th, century, haas, believes, that, the, reason, to, move, so, far, from, water, and, arable, land, was, a, defense, against, enemies, he, asserts, that, isolated, communities, relied, on, raiding, for, food, and, supplies, and, that, internal, conflict, and, warfare, became, common, in, the, 13th, century, this, conflict, may, have, been, aggravated, by, the, influx, of, less, settled, peoples, numic, speakers, such, as, the, utes, shoshones, and, paiute, people, who, may, have, originated, in, what, is, today, california, and, the, arrival, of, the, athabaskan, speaking, din, who, migrated, from, the, north, during, this, time, and, subsequently, became, the, navajo, and, apache, tribes, most, notably, others, suggest, that, more, developed, villages, such, as, that, at, chaco, canyon, exhausted, their, environments, resulting, in, widespread, deforestation, and, eventually, the, fall, of, their, civilization, through, warfare, over, depleted, resources, a, 1997, excavation, at, cowboy, wash, near, dolores, colorado, found, remains, of, at, least, 24, human, skeletons, that, showed, evidence, of, violence, and, dismemberment, with, strong, indications, of, cannibalism, this, modest, community, appears, to, have, been, abandoned, during, the, same, time, period, other, excavations, within, the, ancestral, puebloan, cultural, area, have, produced, varying, numbers, of, unburied, and, in, some, cases, dismembered, bodies, in, a, 2010, paper, potter, and, chuipka, argued, that, evidence, at, sacred, ridge, site, near, durango, colorado, is, best, interpreted, as, warfare, related, to, competition, and, ethnic, cleansing, this, evidence, of, warfare, conflict, and, cannibalism, is, hotly, debated, by, some, scholars, and, interest, groups, suggested, alternatives, include, a, community, suffering, the, pressure, of, starvation, or, extreme, social, stress, dismemberment, and, cannibalism, as, religious, ritual, or, in, response, to, religious, conflict, the, influx, of, outsiders, seeking, to, drive, out, a, settled, agricultural, community, via, calculated, atrocity, or, an, invasion, of, a, settled, region, by, nomadic, raiders, who, practiced, cannibalism, the, term, anasazi, was, established, in, archaeological, terminology, through, the, pecos, classification, system, in, 1927, it, had, been, adopted, from, the, navajo, archaeologist, linda, cordell, discussed, the, word, s, etymology, and, use, the, name, anasazi, has, come, to, mean, ancient, people, although, the, word, itself, is, navajo, meaning, enemy, ancestors, it, is, unfortunate, that, a, non, pueblo, word, has, come, to, stand, for, a, tradition, that, is, certainly, ancestral, pueblo, the, term, was, first, applied, to, ruins, of, the, mesa, verde, by, richard, wetherill, a, rancher, and, trader, who, in, 1888, 1889, was, the, first, anglo, american, to, explore, the, sites, in, that, area, wetherill, knew, and, worked, with, navajos, and, understood, what, the, word, meant, the, name, was, further, sanctioned, in, archaeology, when, it, was, adopted, by, alfred, v, kidder, the, acknowledged, dean, of, southwestern, archaeology, kidder, felt, that, it, was, less, cumbersome, than, a, more, technical, term, he, might, have, used, subsequently, some, archaeologists, who, would, try, to, change, the, term, have, worried, that, because, the, pueblos, speak, different, languages, there, are, different, words, for, ancestor, and, using, one, might, be, offensive, to, people, speaking, other, languages, many, contemporary, pueblo, peoples, object, to, the, use, of, the, term, anasazi, controversy, exists, among, them, on, a, native, alternative, some, modern, descendants, of, this, culture, often, choose, to, use, the, term, ancestral, pueblo, peoples, contemporary, hopi, use, the, word, hisatsinom, in, preference, to, anasazi, others, have, objected, to, cordell, s, definition, of, the, name, anasazi, saying, that, its, true, connotation, means, in, the, navajo, language, those, that, do, things, differently, david, roberts, in, his, book, in, search, of, the, old, ones, exploring, the, anasazi, world, of, the, southwest, explains, his, reason, for, using, the, term, anasazi, over, a, term, like, puebloan, noting, that, the, latter, term, derives, from, the, language, of, an, oppressor, who, treated, the, indigenes, of, the, southwest, far, more, brutally, than, the, navajo, ever, did, archaeological, cultural, units, such, as, ancestral, puebloan, hohokam, patayan, or, mogollon, are, used, by, archaeologists, to, define, material, culture, similarities, and, differences, that, may, identify, prehistoric, sociocultural, units, equivalent, to, modern, societies, or, peoples, the, names, and, divisions, are, classification, devices, based, on, theoretical, perspectives, analytical, methods, and, data, available, at, the, time, of, analysis, and, publication, they, are, subject, to, change, not, only, on, the, basis, of, new, information, and, discoveries, but, also, as, attitudes, and, perspectives, change, within, the, scientific, community, it, should, not, be, assumed, that, an, archaeological, division, or, culture, unit, corresponds, to, a, particular, language, group, or, to, a, socio, political, entity, such, as, a, tribe, current, terms, and, conventions, have, significant, limitations, defining, cultural, groups, such, as, the, ancestral, puebloans, tends, to, create, an, image, of, territories, separated, by, clear, cut, boundaries, like, border, boundaries, separating, modern, states, these, did, not, exist, prehistoric, people, traded, worshipped, collaborated, and, fought, most, often, with, other, nearby, groups, cultural, differences, should, therefore, be, understood, as, clinal, increasing, gradually, as, the, distance, separating, groups, also, increases, departures, from, the, expected, pattern, may, occur, because, of, unidentified, social, or, political, situations, or, because, of, geographic, barriers, in, the, southwest, mountain, ranges, rivers, and, most, obviously, the, grand, canyon, can, be, significant, barriers, for, human, communities, likely, reducing, the, frequency, of, contact, with, other, groups, current, opinion, holds, that, the, closer, cultural, similarity, between, the, mogollon, and, ancestral, puebloans, and, their, greater, differences, from, the, hohokam, and, patayan, is, due, to, both, the, geography, and, the, variety, of, climate, zones, in, the, southwest, notes, bibliography
