the, wari, spanish, huari, were, a, middle, horizon, civilization, that, flourished, in, the, south, central, andes, and, coastal, area, of, modern, day, peru, from, about, 500, to, 1000, ad, wari, as, the, former, capital, city, was, called, is, located, 11, km, 6, 8, mi, north, east, of, the, modern, city, of, ayacucho, peru, this, city, was, the, center, of, a, civilization, that, covered, much, of, the, highlands, and, coast, of, modern, peru, the, best, preserved, remnants, beside, the, wari, ruins, are, the, recently, discovered, northern, wari, ruins, near, the, city, of, chiclayo, and, cerro, ba, l, in, moquegua, also, well, known, are, the, wari, ruins, of, pikillaqta, flea, town, a, short, distance, south, east, of, cuzco, en, route, to, lake, titicaca, however, there, is, still, a, debate, whether, the, wari, dominated, the, central, coast, or, the, polities, on, the, central, coast, were, commercial, states, capable, of, interacting, with, the, wari, people, without, being, politically, dominated, by, them, archaeological, evidence, points, toward, the, wari, empire, taking, control, of, a, number, of, small, villages, in, peru, s, carahuarazo, valley, in, approximately, 600, a, d, during, the, empire, s, initial, expansion, the, incursion, caused, a, number, of, the, valley, s, existing, villages, to, be, abandoned, with, one, partially, destroyed, to, make, room, for, a, wari, administrative, center, known, as, jincamocco, the, wari, introduced, terracing, agriculture, to, the, area, shifting, the, staple, crops, of, the, valley, from, tubers, to, both, tubers, and, maize, wari, storage, structures, have, been, found, in, the, area, seemingly, paired, with, some, of, remaining, villages, agricultural, sites, these, were, likely, used, to, store, both, staple, crops, wari, occupation, of, the, carahuarazo, valley, lasted, until, roughly, 800, a, d, leading, to, the, abandonment, of, most, of, the, valley, s, sites, after, that, time, early, on, the, wari, expanded, their, territory, to, include, the, ancient, oracle, center, of, pachacamac, though, it, seems, to, have, remained, largely, autonomous, later, the, wari, became, dominant, in, much, of, the, territory, of, the, earlier, moche, and, later, chimu, cultures, the, reason, for, this, expansion, has, been, debated, it, is, believed, to, have, been, driven, by, religious, conversion, the, spread, of, agricultural, knowledge, specifically, terrace, agriculture, or, military, conquest, militarism, and, the, associated, threat, violence, that, comes, with, it, has, consistently, played, a, part, in, the, expansion, and, maintenance, of, ancient, empires, with, wari, being, of, no, exception, evidence, of, the, violence, present, in, wari, culture, is, most, visible, at, the, city, of, conchopata, as, a, result, of, centuries, of, drought, the, wari, culture, began, to, deteriorate, around, 800, ad, archeologists, have, determined, that, the, city, of, wari, was, dramatically, depopulated, by, 1000, ad, although, it, continued, to, be, occupied, by, a, small, number, of, descendant, groups, buildings, in, wari, and, in, other, government, centers, had, doorways, that, were, deliberately, blocked, up, as, if, the, wari, intended, to, return, someday, when, the, rains, returned, by, the, time, this, happened, though, the, wari, had, faded, from, history, in, the, meantime, the, dwindling, residents, of, the, wari, cities, ceased, all, major, construction, archaeological, evidence, shows, significant, levels, of, interpersonal, violence, suggesting, that, warfare, and, raiding, increased, amongst, rival, groups, upon, the, collapse, of, the, wari, state, structure, with, the, collapse, of, the, wari, the, late, intermediate, period, is, said, to, begin, little, is, known, about, the, details, of, the, wari, administrative, structure, as, they, did, not, appear, to, use, a, form, of, written, record, instead, they, used, a, tool, called, khipu, or, knot, record, despite, being, most, widely, known, for, its, use, in, inca, accounting, many, scholars, believe, that, the, earliest, use, of, it, as, a, recording, tool, happened, in, wari, archaeologists, however, still, rely, on, homogeneous, administrative, architecture, and, evidence, of, significant, social, stratification, to, help, better, understand, the, complex, sociopolitical, hierarchy, of, wari, the, discovery, in, early, 2013, of, an, undisturbed, royal, tomb, el, castillo, de, huarmey, offers, new, insight, into, the, social, and, political, influence, of, the, wari, during, this, period, the, variety, and, extent, of, the, burial, items, accompanying, the, three, royal, women, indicate, a, culture, with, significant, material, wealth, and, the, power, to, dominate, a, significant, part, of, northern, coastal, peru, for, many, decades, another, example, of, burials, helping, to, establish, social, stratification, is, in, the, city, of, conchopata, where, the, remains, of, more, than, 200, individuals, have, been, found, this, city, is, located, about, 10, km, from, the, capital, city, prior, to, its, excavation, the, city, was, believed, to, be, that, of, potters, but, the, burials, studied, instead, showed, that, there, were, servants, middle, class, elite, and, even, perhaps, low, kings, or, governors, occupying, the, city, further, investigations, on, a, random, selection, of, the, burials, from, the, site, have, shown, that, 26, percent, of, both, male, and, female, adult, crania, studied, had, at, least, one, posterior, wound, while, only, females, had, been, subject, to, anterior, wounds, the, different, levels, of, violence, based, on, sex, is, evidence, of, some, type, of, systematic, hierarchy, during, its, expansion, period, the, wari, state, established, architecturally, distinctive, administrative, centers, in, many, of, its, provinces, but, they, often, did, not, have, formal, planning, as, many, other, andean, cities, did, these, centers, are, clearly, different, from, the, architecture, of, tiwanaku, which, is, believed, to, have, been, a, more, federalized, state, by, some, scholars, such, as, john, w, janusek, wari, architecture, was, most, often, made, of, rough, fieldstones, that, had, been, coated, in, white, plaster, the, compounds, were, usually, large, rectangular, enclosures, with, no, windows, just, a, few, entries, and, the, sites, had, no, central, place, for, people, to, gather, for, rituals, or, ceremonies, this, is, in, almost, direct, contrast, with, tiwanaku, where, there, was, a, more, open, architectural, plan, that, could, easily, accommodate, multiple, people, at, once, a, form, of, architecture, distinctive, to, wari, was, the, use, of, d, shaped, structures, these, structures, were, commonly, used, for, temples, and, were, relatively, small, at, only, 10, meters, using, administrative, centers, like, their, temples, the, wari, greatly, influenced, the, surrounding, countryside, scholars, were, able, to, look, at, the, inca, to, reconstruct, some, of, the, architecture, of, the, wari, along, the, inca, highway, system, several, wari, provincial, sites, were, found, suggesting, that, the, wari, used, a, similar, road, network, they, also, created, new, fields, with, terraced, field, technology, which, the, inca, also, drew, inspiration, from, based, on, remains, from, multiple, wari, sites, archaeologists, have, determined, that, feasts, and, offerings, of, food, were, a, powerful, driving, force, in, the, social, life, of, the, wari, multiple, instances, of, camelid, remains, found, in, the, province, of, cotocotuyoc, point, toward, the, usage, of, such, animals, as, symbols, of, social, capital, especially, because, they, were, uncommon, in, the, area, some, camelid, remains, were, found, devoid, of, cut, marks, and, stacked, on, top, of, human, bones, leading, researchers, to, think, they, were, intentionally, not, fully, eaten, to, display, the, feast, s, host, s, wealth, in, a, process, known, as, ritual, wasteful, consumption, the, wari, worshipped, the, staff, god, a, chief, deity, in, many, andean, cultures, some, of, the, oldest, depictions, of, the, staff, god, appear, on, wari, textiles, and, pottery, urns, estimated, to, be, over, 3, 000, years, old, some, scholars, believe, that, the, wari, staff, god, was, a, predecessor, of, the, three, incan, principle, gods, sun, moon, and, thunder, the, wari, practiced, animal, sacrifice, complete, skeletal, remains, of, a, young, camelid, and, thirty, two, guinea, pigs, were, found, buried, in, a, lineage, house, in, the, city, of, conchopata, ten, kilometers, from, the, capital, city, of, wari, the, complete, nature, of, the, remains, as, well, as, the, age, of, the, camelid, point, toward, the, animals, being, sacrificed, at, the, end, of, the, ayachuco, valley, s, rainy, season, the, wari, are, particularly, known, for, their, textiles, which, were, well, preserved, in, desert, burials, the, standardization, of, textile, motifs, serves, as, artistic, evidence, of, state, control, over, elite, art, production, in, the, wari, state, surviving, textiles, include, tapestries, hats, and, tunics, for, high, ranking, officials, there, are, between, six, and, nine, miles, of, thread, in, each, tunic, and, they, often, feature, highly, abstracted, versions, of, typical, andean, artistic, motifs, such, as, the, staff, god, it, is, possible, that, these, abstract, designs, served, a, mysterious, or, esoteric, code, to, keep, out, uninitiated, foreign, subjects, and, that, the, geometric, distortions, made, the, wearer, s, chest, appear, larger, to, reflect, their, high, rank, the, wari, also, produced, highly, sophisticated, metalwork, and, ceramics, with, similar, designs, to, the, textiles, the, most, common, metals, used, were, silver, and, copper, though, gold, wari, artifacts, also, survive, the, most, common, metal, objects, were, qiru, bowls, jewelry, mummy, bundle, masks, mantle, pins, and, sheet, figures, who, demonstrate, how, the, tunics, were, worn, ceramics, were, typically, polychrome, and, frequently, depicted, food, and, animals, conchopata, appears, to, have, been, the, ceramic, center, of, wari, culture, given, the, high, quantities, of, pottery, tools, firing, rooms, pit, kilns, potsherds, and, ceramic, molds, in, one, of, the, d, shaped, temples, at, conchopata, there, were, large, smashed, chicha, vessels, on, the, floor, and, human, heads, placed, as, offerings, as, a, form, of, human, sacrifice
