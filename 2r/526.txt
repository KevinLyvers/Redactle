the, khmer, rouge, k, m, r, r, u, french, khmer, khm, r, kr, h, m, lit, red, khmer, is, the, name, that, was, popularly, given, to, members, of, the, communist, party, of, kampuchea, cpk, and, by, extension, to, the, regime, through, which, the, cpk, ruled, cambodia, between, 1975, and, 1979, the, name, was, coined, in, the, 1960s, by, then, chief, of, state, norodom, sihanouk, to, describe, his, country, s, heterogeneous, communist, led, dissidents, with, whom, he, allied, after, the, 1970, cambodian, coup, d, tat, the, khmer, rouge, army, was, slowly, built, up, in, the, forests, of, eastern, cambodia, during, the, late, 1960s, supported, by, the, north, vietnamese, army, the, viet, cong, the, pathet, lao, and, the, chinese, communist, party, ccp, although, it, originally, fought, against, sihanouk, the, khmer, rouge, changed, its, position, and, supported, sihanouk, following, the, ccp, s, advice, after, he, was, overthrown, in, a, 1970, coup, d, tat, by, lon, nol, who, established, the, pro, american, khmer, republic, despite, a, massive, american, bombing, campaign, operation, freedom, deal, against, them, the, khmer, rouge, won, the, cambodian, civil, war, when, they, captured, the, cambodian, capital, and, overthrew, the, khmer, republic, in, 1975, following, their, victory, the, khmer, rouge, who, were, led, by, pol, pot, nuon, chea, ieng, sary, son, sen, and, khieu, samphan, immediately, set, about, forcibly, evacuating, the, country, s, major, cities, in, 1976, they, renamed, the, country, democratic, kampuchea, the, khmer, rouge, regime, was, highly, autocratic, totalitarian, and, repressive, many, deaths, resulted, from, the, regime, s, social, engineering, policies, and, the, moha, lout, plaoh, an, imitation, of, china, s, great, leap, forward, which, had, caused, the, great, chinese, famine, the, khmer, rouge, s, attempts, at, agricultural, reform, through, collectivization, similarly, led, to, widespread, famine, while, its, insistence, on, absolute, self, sufficiency, including, the, supply, of, medicine, led, to, the, death, of, many, thousands, from, treatable, diseases, such, as, malaria, the, khmer, rouge, regime, murdered, hundreds, of, thousands, of, their, perceived, political, opponents, and, its, racist, emphasis, on, national, purity, resulted, in, the, genocide, of, cambodian, minorities, summary, executions, and, torture, were, carried, out, by, its, cadres, against, perceived, subversive, elements, or, during, genocidal, purges, of, its, own, ranks, between, 1975, and, 1978, ultimately, the, cambodian, genocide, which, took, place, under, the, khmer, rouge, regime, led, to, the, deaths, of, 1, 5, to, 2, million, people, around, 25, of, cambodia, s, population, in, the, 1970s, the, khmer, rouge, was, largely, supported, and, funded, by, the, chinese, communist, party, receiving, approval, from, mao, zedong, it, is, estimated, that, at, least, 90, of, the, foreign, aid, which, was, provided, to, the, khmer, rouge, came, from, china, the, regime, was, removed, from, power, in, 1979, when, vietnam, invaded, cambodia, and, quickly, destroyed, most, of, its, forces, the, khmer, rouge, then, fled, to, thailand, whose, government, saw, them, as, a, buffer, force, against, the, communist, vietnamese, the, khmer, rouge, continued, to, fight, against, the, vietnamese, and, the, government, of, the, new, people, s, republic, of, kampuchea, until, the, end, of, the, war, in, 1989, the, cambodian, governments, in, exile, including, the, khmer, rouge, held, onto, cambodia, s, united, nations, seat, with, considerable, international, support, until, 1993, when, the, monarchy, was, restored, and, the, name, of, the, cambodian, state, was, changed, to, the, kingdom, of, cambodia, a, year, later, thousands, of, khmer, rouge, guerrillas, surrendered, themselves, in, a, government, amnesty, in, 1996, a, new, political, party, called, the, democratic, national, union, movement, was, formed, by, ieng, sary, who, was, granted, amnesty, for, his, role, as, the, deputy, leader, of, the, khmer, rouge, the, organisation, was, largely, dissolved, by, the, mid, 1990s, and, finally, surrendered, completely, in, 1999, in, 2014, two, khmer, rouge, leaders, nuon, chea, and, khieu, samphan, were, jailed, for, life, by, a, united, nations, backed, court, which, found, them, guilty, of, crimes, against, humanity, for, their, roles, in, the, khmer, rouge, s, genocidal, campaign, the, term, khmers, rouges, french, for, red, khmers, was, coined, by, king, norodom, sihanouk, and, it, was, later, adopted, by, english, speakers, in, the, form, of, the, corrupted, version, khmer, rouge, 100, it, was, used, to, refer, to, a, succession, of, communist, parties, in, cambodia, which, evolved, into, the, communist, party, of, kampuchea, and, later, the, party, of, democratic, kampuchea, its, military, was, known, successively, as, the, kampuchean, revolutionary, army, and, the, national, army, of, democratic, kampuchea, since, the, deterioration, in, relations, between, the, socialist, republic, of, vietnam, and, democratic, kampuchea, the, vietnamese, government, no, longer, recognize, the, legitimacy, of, the, khmer, rouge, and, as, a, result, they, call, the, khmer, rouge, the, pol, pot, ieng, sary, clique, vietnamese, t, p, o, n, pol, pot, ieng, sary, or, the, pol, pot, ieng, sary, reactionary, clique, vietnamese, t, p, o, n, ph, n, ng, pol, pot, ieng, sary, the, movement, s, ideology, was, shaped, by, a, power, struggle, during, 1976, in, which, the, so, called, party, centre, led, by, pol, pot, defeated, other, regional, elements, of, its, leadership, the, party, centre, s, ideology, combined, elements, of, communism, with, a, strongly, xenophobic, form, of, khmer, nationalism, partly, because, of, its, secrecy, and, changes, in, how, it, presented, itself, academic, interpretations, of, its, political, position, vary, widely, 25, ranging, from, interpreting, it, as, the, purest, marxist, leninist, movement, to, characterising, it, as, an, anti, marxist, peasant, revolution, 26, the, first, interpretation, has, been, criticized, by, historian, ben, kiernan, who, asserts, that, it, comes, from, a, convenient, anti, communist, perspective, 26, its, leaders, and, theorists, most, of, whom, had, been, exposed, to, the, heavily, stalinist, outlook, of, the, french, communist, party, during, the, 1950s, 249, developed, a, distinctive, and, eclectic, post, leninist, ideology, that, drew, on, elements, of, stalinism, maoism, and, the, postcolonial, theory, of, frantz, fanon, 244, in, the, early, 1970s, the, khmer, rouge, looked, to, the, model, of, enver, hoxha, s, albania, which, they, believed, was, the, most, advanced, communist, state, then, in, existence, 25, many, of, the, regime, s, characteristics, such, as, its, focus, on, the, rural, peasantry, rather, than, the, urban, proletariat, as, the, bulwark, of, revolution, its, emphasis, on, great, leap, forward, type, initiatives, its, desire, to, abolish, personal, interest, in, human, behaviour, its, promotion, of, communal, living, and, eating, and, its, focus, on, perceived, common, sense, over, technical, knowledge, appear, to, have, been, heavily, influenced, by, maoist, ideology, 244, however, the, khmer, rouge, displayed, these, characteristics, in, a, more, extreme, form, 244, additionally, non, khmers, who, comprised, a, significant, part, of, the, supposedly, favored, segment, of, the, peasantry, were, singled, out, because, of, their, race, 26, according, to, ben, kiernan, this, was, neither, a, communist, proletarian, revolution, that, privileged, the, working, class, nor, a, peasant, revolution, that, favored, all, farmers, 26, while, the, cpk, described, itself, as, the, number, 1, communist, state, once, it, was, in, power, 25, some, communist, regimes, such, as, vietnam, saw, it, as, a, maoist, deviation, from, orthodox, marxism, 26, according, to, author, rebecca, gidley, the, khmer, rouge, almost, immediately, erred, by, implementing, a, maoist, doctrine, rather, than, following, the, marxist, leninist, prescriptions, the, maoist, and, khmer, rouge, belief, that, human, willpower, could, overcome, material, and, historical, conditions, was, strongly, at, odds, with, mainstream, marxism, which, emphasised, historical, materialism, and, the, idea, of, history, as, inevitable, progression, toward, communism, 27, in, 1981, following, the, cambodian, vietnamese, war, in, an, attempt, to, get, foreign, support, the, khmer, rouge, officially, renounced, communism, one, of, the, regime, s, main, characteristics, was, its, khmer, nationalism, which, combined, an, idealisation, of, the, angkor, empire, 802, 1431, and, the, late, middle, period, of, cambodia, 1431, 1863, with, an, existential, fear, for, the, survival, of, the, cambodian, state, which, had, historically, been, liquidated, during, periods, of, vietnamese, and, siamese, intervention, the, spillover, of, vietnamese, fighters, from, the, vietnamese, american, war, further, aggravated, anti, vietnamese, sentiments, the, khmer, republic, under, lon, nol, overthrown, by, the, khmer, rouge, had, promoted, mon, khmer, nationalism, and, was, responsible, for, several, anti, vietnamese, pogroms, during, the, 1970s, some, historians, such, as, ben, kiernan, have, stated, that, the, importance, the, regime, gave, to, race, overshadowed, its, conceptions, of, class, 26, the, khmer, rouge, targeted, particular, groups, of, people, among, them, buddhist, monks, ethnic, minorities, and, educated, elites, once, in, power, the, khmer, rouge, explicitly, targeted, the, chinese, the, vietnamese, the, cham, minority, and, even, their, partially, khmer, offspring, the, same, attitude, extended, to, the, party, s, own, ranks, as, senior, cpk, figures, of, non, khmer, ethnicity, were, removed, from, the, leadership, despite, extensive, revolutionary, experience, and, were, often, killed, 26, a, vietnamese, official, called, the, khmer, rouge, leaders, hitlerite, fascists, while, the, general, secretary, of, the, kampuchean, people, s, revolutionary, party, pen, sovan, referred, to, the, khmer, rouge, as, a, draconian, dictatorial, and, fascist, regime, the, khmer, rouge, s, economic, policy, which, was, largely, based, on, the, plans, of, khieu, samphan, focused, on, the, achievement, of, national, self, reliance, through, an, initial, phase, of, agricultural, collectivism, this, would, then, be, used, as, a, route, to, achieve, rapid, social, transformation, and, industrial, and, technological, development, without, assistance, from, foreign, powers, a, process, which, the, party, characterised, as, a, super, great, leap, forward, the, party, s, general, secretary, pol, pot, strongly, influenced, the, propagation, of, the, policy, of, autarky, he, was, reportedly, impressed, with, the, self, sufficient, manner, in, which, the, mountain, tribes, of, cambodia, lived, which, the, party, believed, was, a, form, of, primitive, communism, khmer, rouge, theory, developed, the, concept, that, the, nation, should, take, agriculture, as, the, basic, factor, and, use, the, fruits, of, agriculture, to, build, industry, 110, in, 1975, khmer, rouge, representatives, to, china, said, that, pol, pot, s, belief, was, that, the, collectivisation, of, agriculture, was, capable, of, a, complete, communist, society, without, wasting, time, on, the, intermediate, steps, society, was, accordingly, classified, into, peasant, base, people, pr, ch, ach, n, mul, dthan, who, would, be, the, bulwark, of, the, transformation, and, urban, new, people, pr, ch, ach, n, thmei, who, were, to, be, reeducated, or, liquidated, the, focus, of, the, khmer, rouge, leadership, on, the, peasantry, as, the, base, of, the, revolution, was, according, to, michael, vickery, a, product, of, their, status, as, petty, bourgeois, radicals, who, had, been, overcome, by, peasantist, romanticism, 306, the, opposition, of, the, peasantry, and, the, urban, population, in, khmer, rouge, ideology, was, heightened, by, the, structure, of, the, cambodian, rural, economy, where, small, farmers, and, peasants, had, historically, suffered, from, indebtedness, to, urban, money, lenders, rather, than, suffering, from, indebtedness, to, landlords, 284, the, policy, of, evacuating, major, towns, as, well, as, providing, a, reserve, of, easily, exploitable, agricultural, labour, was, likely, viewed, positively, by, the, khmer, rouge, s, peasant, supporters, as, removing, the, source, of, their, debts, 284, democratic, kampuchea, was, an, atheist, state, although, its, constitution, stated, that, everyone, had, freedom, of, religion, or, not, to, hold, a, religion, however, it, specified, that, what, it, termed, reactionary, religion, would, not, be, permitted, 191, while, in, practice, religious, activity, was, not, tolerated, the, relationship, of, the, cpk, to, the, majority, cambodian, theravada, buddhism, was, complex, several, key, figures, in, its, history, such, as, tou, samouth, and, ta, mok, were, former, monks, along, with, many, lower, level, cadres, who, often, proved, some, of, the, strictest, disciplinarians, 191, while, there, was, extreme, harassment, of, buddhist, institutions, there, was, a, tendency, for, the, cpk, regime, to, internalise, and, reconfigure, the, symbolism, and, language, of, cambodian, buddhism, so, that, many, revolutionary, slogans, mimicked, the, formulae, learned, by, young, monks, during, their, training, 182, some, cadres, who, had, previously, been, monks, interpreted, their, change, of, vocation, as, a, simple, movement, from, a, lower, to, a, higher, religion, mirroring, attitudes, around, the, growth, of, cao, dai, in, the, 1920s, 193, buddhist, laity, seem, not, to, have, been, singled, out, for, persecution, although, traditional, belief, in, the, tutelary, spirits, or, neak, ta, rapidly, eroded, as, people, were, forcibly, moved, from, their, home, areas, 176, the, position, with, buddhist, monks, was, more, complicated, as, with, islam, many, religious, leaders, were, killed, whereas, many, ordinary, monks, were, sent, to, remote, monasteries, where, they, were, subjected, to, hard, physical, labour, 176, the, same, division, between, rural, and, urban, populations, was, seen, in, the, regime, s, treatment, of, monks, for, instance, those, from, urban, monasteries, were, classified, as, new, monks, and, sent, to, rural, areas, to, live, alongside, base, monks, of, peasant, background, who, were, classified, as, proper, and, revolutionary, 176, monks, were, not, ordered, to, defrock, until, as, late, as, 1977, in, krati, province, where, many, monks, found, that, they, reverted, to, the, status, of, lay, peasantry, as, the, agricultural, work, they, were, allocated, to, involved, regular, breaches, of, monastic, rules, 192, while, there, is, evidence, of, widespread, vandalism, of, buddhist, monasteries, many, more, than, were, initially, thought, survived, the, khmer, rouge, years, in, fair, condition, as, did, most, khmer, historical, monuments, and, it, is, possible, that, stories, of, their, near, total, destruction, were, propaganda, issued, by, the, successor, people, s, republic, of, kampuchea, 181, nevertheless, it, has, been, estimated, that, nearly, 25, 000, buddhist, monks, were, killed, by, the, regime, the, repression, of, islam, practised, by, the, country, s, cham, minority, was, extensive, islamic, religious, leaders, were, executed, although, some, cham, muslims, appear, to, have, been, told, they, could, continue, devotions, in, private, as, long, as, it, did, not, interfere, with, work, quotas, 176, mat, ly, a, cham, who, served, as, the, deputy, minister, of, agriculture, under, the, people, s, republic, of, kampuchea, stated, that, khmer, rouge, troops, had, perpetrated, a, number, of, massacres, in, cham, villages, in, the, central, and, eastern, zones, where, the, residents, had, refused, to, give, up, islamic, customs, 347, while, fran, ois, ponchaud, stated, that, christians, were, invariably, taken, away, and, killed, with, the, accusation, of, having, links, with, the, u, s, central, intelligence, agency, at, least, some, cadres, appear, to, have, regarded, it, as, preferable, to, the, feudal, class, based, buddhism, 193, nevertheless, it, remained, deeply, suspect, to, the, regime, thanks, to, its, close, links, to, french, colonialism, phnom, penh, cathedral, was, razed, along, with, other, places, of, worship, 193, in, analysing, the, khmer, rouge, regime, scholars, place, it, within, historical, context, the, khmer, rouge, came, to, power, in, 1975, through, the, cambodian, civil, war, where, the, united, states, had, supported, the, opposing, regime, of, lon, nol, and, heavily, bombed, cambodia, 89, 99, primarily, targeting, communist, vietnamese, troops, who, were, allied, to, the, khmer, rouge, but, it, gave, the, khmer, rouge, s, leadership, a, justification, to, eliminate, the, pro, vietnamese, faction, within, the, group, 97, the, cambodian, genocide, was, stopped, with, the, khmer, rouge, s, overthrow, in, 1979, by, communist, vietnam, 88, there, have, been, allegations, of, united, states, support, for, the, khmer, rouge, following, their, overthrow, and, the, united, nations, general, assembly, voted, to, continue, recognising, pol, pot, s, democratic, kampuchea, 93, communism, in, south, east, asia, was, deeply, divided, as, china, supported, the, khmer, rouge, while, the, soviet, union, and, vietnam, opposed, it, 89, there, are, three, interpretations, of, the, khmer, rouge, totalitarianism, revisionism, and, postrevisionism, historian, ben, kiernan, describes, their, rule, as, totalitarian, but, places, it, within, the, context, of, xenophobic, european, nationalism, from, which, came, their, agrarianism, and, the, establishment, of, a, great, cambodia, rather, than, communism, or, marxism, 96, pol, pot, s, biographers, david, p, chandler, and, philip, short, place, more, emphasis, on, their, ideological, heritage, of, communism, 96, it, was, not, easy, to, apply, karl, marx, and, vladimir, lenin, s, ideas, to, cambodia, and, communism, was, chosen, as, a, way, to, get, rid, of, french, colonialism, and, transform, the, feudal, society, 97, another, interpretation, as, proposed, by, historian, michael, vickery, is, that, of, a, bottom, up, left, wing, peasant, revolution, with, the, khmer, rouge, as, the, revolutionaries, 97, the, khmer, rouge, was, an, intellectual, group, with, a, middle, class, background, and, a, romanticised, sympathy, for, rural, poor, people, but, with, little, to, no, awareness, that, their, radical, policies, would, lead, to, such, violence, 97, according, to, this, view, the, applicability, of, genocide, is, rejected, and, the, violence, was, an, unintentional, consequence, that, was, beyond, the, khmer, rouge, s, control, 97, for, vickery, communist, ideology, does, not, explain, the, violence, any, more, than, those, closer, to, the, peasants, such, as, agrarianism, populism, and, nationalism, 97, vickery, wrote, of, communisms, as, different, communist, factions, were, opposed, to, each, other, and, fought, against, each, other, resulting, in, further, escalation, of, violence, 98, a, synthesis, of, both, interpretations, rejects, the, totalitarian, theory, in, favor, of, a, bottom, up, perspective, which, emphasises, that, the, peasants, did, not, have, revolutionary, ambitions, 98, according, to, this, perspective, the, khmer, rouge, was, able, to, effectively, manipulate, the, peasants, to, mobilise, them, towards, collective, goals, that, they, did, not, understand, or, where, the, revolutionaries, had, no, desire, to, create, a, new, society, which, would, require, a, certain, level, of, support, and, understanding, that, the, khmer, rouge, was, not, able, to, win, over, but, were, mainly, motivated, to, tear, down, the, old, one, and, violence, became, an, end, in, itself, 98, the, history, of, the, communist, movement, in, cambodia, can, be, divided, into, six, phases, namely, the, emergence, before, world, war, ii, of, the, indochinese, communist, party, icp, whose, members, were, almost, exclusively, vietnamese, the, 10, year, struggle, for, independence, from, the, french, when, a, separate, cambodian, communist, party, the, kampuchean, or, khmer, people, s, revolutionary, party, kprp, was, established, under, vietnamese, auspices, the, period, following, the, second, party, congress, of, the, kprp, in, 1960, when, saloth, sar, gained, control, of, its, apparatus, the, revolutionary, struggle, from, the, initiation, of, the, khmer, rouge, insurgency, in, 1967, 1968, to, the, fall, of, the, lon, nol, government, in, april, 1975, the, democratic, kampuchea, regime, from, april, 1975, to, january, 1979, and, the, period, following, the, third, party, congress, of, the, kprp, in, january, 1979, when, hanoi, effectively, assumed, control, over, cambodia, s, government, and, communist, party, in, 1930, ho, chi, minh, founded, the, communist, party, of, vietnam, by, unifying, three, smaller, communist, movements, that, had, emerged, in, northern, central, and, southern, vietnam, during, the, late, 1920s, the, party, was, renamed, the, indochinese, communist, party, ostensibly, so, it, could, include, revolutionaries, from, cambodia, and, laos, almost, without, exception, all, of, the, earliest, party, members, were, vietnamese, by, the, end, of, world, war, ii, a, handful, of, cambodians, had, joined, its, ranks, but, their, influence, on, the, indochinese, communist, movement, as, well, as, their, influence, on, developments, within, cambodia, was, negligible, viet, minh, units, occasionally, made, forays, into, cambodian, bases, during, their, war, against, the, french, and, in, conjunction, with, the, leftist, government, that, ruled, thailand, until, 1947, the, viet, minh, encouraged, the, formation, of, armed, left, wing, khmer, issarak, bands, on, 17, april, 1950, the, first, nationwide, congress, of, the, khmer, issarak, groups, convened, and, the, united, issarak, front, was, established, its, leader, was, son, ngoc, minh, and, a, third, of, its, leadership, consisted, of, members, of, the, icp, according, to, the, historian, david, p, chandler, the, leftist, issarak, groups, aided, by, the, viet, minh, occupied, a, sixth, of, cambodia, s, territory, by, 1952, and, on, the, eve, of, the, geneva, conference, in, 1954, they, controlled, as, much, as, one, half, of, the, country, 180, 1, in, 1951, the, icp, was, reorganized, into, three, national, units, namely, the, vietnam, workers, party, the, lao, issara, and, the, kampuchean, or, khmer, people, s, revolutionary, party, kprp, according, to, a, document, issued, after, the, reorganization, the, vietnam, workers, party, would, continue, to, supervise, the, smaller, laotian, and, cambodian, movements, most, kprp, leaders, and, rank, and, file, seem, to, have, been, either, khmer, krom, or, ethnic, vietnamese, living, in, cambodia, according, to, democratic, kampuchea, s, perspective, of, party, history, the, viet, minh, s, failure, to, negotiate, a, political, role, for, the, kprp, at, the, 1954, geneva, conference, represented, a, betrayal, of, the, cambodian, movement, which, still, controlled, large, areas, of, the, countryside, and, which, commanded, at, least, 5, 000, armed, men, following, the, conference, about, 1, 000, members, of, the, kprp, including, son, ngoc, minh, made, a, long, march, into, north, vietnam, where, they, remained, in, exile, in, late, 1954, those, who, stayed, in, cambodia, founded, a, legal, political, party, the, pracheachon, party, which, participated, in, the, 1955, and, the, 1958, national, assembly, elections, in, the, september, 1955, election, it, won, about, 4, of, the, vote, but, did, not, secure, a, seat, in, the, legislature, members, of, the, pracheachon, were, subject, to, harassment, and, arrests, because, the, party, remained, outside, sihanouk, s, political, organization, sangkum, government, attacks, prevented, it, from, participating, in, the, 1962, election, and, drove, it, underground, sihanouk, habitually, labelled, local, leftists, the, khmer, rouge, a, term, that, later, came, to, signify, the, party, and, the, state, headed, by, pol, pot, ieng, sary, khieu, samphan, and, their, associates, during, the, mid, 1950s, kprp, factions, the, urban, committee, headed, by, tou, samouth, and, the, rural, committee, headed, by, sieu, heng, emerged, in, very, general, terms, these, groups, espoused, divergent, revolutionary, lines, the, prevalent, urban, line, endorsed, by, north, vietnam, recognized, that, sihanouk, by, virtue, of, his, success, in, winning, independence, from, the, french, was, a, genuine, national, leader, whose, neutralism, and, deep,

to, east, berlin, to, participate, in, a, youth, festival, this, experience, is, considered, to, have, been, a, turning, point, in, their, ideological, development, meeting, with, khmers, who, were, fighting, with, the, viet, minh, but, subsequently, judged, them, to, be, too, subservient, to, the, vietnamese, they, became, convinced, that, only, a, tightly, disciplined, party, organization, and, a, readiness, for, armed, struggle, could, achieve, revolution, they, transformed, the, khmer, students, association, ksa, to, which, most, of, the, 200, or, so, khmer, students, in, paris, belonged, into, an, organization, for, nationalist, and, leftist, ideas, inside, the, ksa, and, its, successor, organizations, there, was, a, secret, organization, known, as, the, cercle, marxiste, marxist,

marxiste, the, doctoral, dissertations, which, were, written, by, hou, yuon, and, khieu, samphan, express, basic, themes, that, would, later, become, the, cornerstones, of, the, policy, that, was, adopted, by, democratic, kampuchea, the, central, role, of, the, peasants, in, national, development, was, espoused, by, hou, yuon, in, his, 1955, thesis, the, cambodian, peasants, and, their, prospects, for, modernization, which, challenged, the, conventional, view, that, urbanization, and, industrialization, are, necessary, precursors, of, development, 63, the, major, argument, in, khieu, samphan, s, 1959, thesis, cambodia, s, economy, and, industrial, development, was, that, the, country, had, to, become, self, reliant, and, end, its, economic, dependency, on, the, developed, world, in, its, general, contours, samphan, s, work, reflected, the, influence, of, a, branch, of, the, dependency, theory, school, which, blamed, lack, of, development, in, the, third, world, on, the, economic, domination, of, the, industrialized, nations, 63, after, returning, to, cambodia, in, 1953, pol, pot, threw, himself, into, party, work, at, first, he, went, to, join, with, forces, allied,

academic, circle, the, following, year, the, government, closed, the, paper, and, sihanouk, s, police, publicly, humiliated, samphan, by, beating, undressing, and, photographing, him, in, public, as, shawcross, notes, not, the, sort, of, humiliation, that, men, forgive, or, forget, 92, 100, 106, 112, yet, the, experience, did, not, prevent, samphan, from, advocating, cooperation, with, sihanouk, in, order, to, promote, a, united, front, against, united, states, activities, in, south, vietnam, khieu, samphan, hou, yuon, and, hu, nim, were, forced, to, work, through, the, system, by, joining,

penh, railroad, station, this, pivotal, event, remains, shrouded, in, mystery, because, its, outcome, has, become, an, object, of, contention, and, considerable, historical, rewriting, between, pro, vietnamese, and, anti, vietnamese, khmer, communist, factions, the, question, of, cooperation, with, or, resistance, to, sihanouk, was, thoroughly, discussed, tou, samouth, who, advocated, a, policy,

revolution, in, china, class, conflicts, and, communist, international, pol, pot, was, particularly, impressed, by, the, lecture, on, political, purge, by, kang, sheng, this, experience, had, enhanced, his, prestige, when, he, returned, to, the, wpk, s, liberated, areas, despite, friendly, relations, between, sihanouk, and, the, chinese, the, latter, kept, pol, pot, s, visit, a, secret, from, sihanouk, in, september, 1966, the, wpk, changed, its, name, to, the, communist, party, of, kampuchea, cpk, the, change, in, the, name, of, the, party, was, a, closely, guarded, secret, lower, ranking, members, of, the, party, and, even, the, vietnamese, were, not, told, of, it, and, neither, was, the, membership, until, many, years, later, the, party, leadership, endorsed, armed, struggle, against, the, government, then, led, by, sihanouk, in, 1968, the, khmer, rouge, was, officially, formed, and, its, forces, launched, a, national, insurgency, across, cambodia, though, north, vietnam, had, not, been, informed, of, the, decision, its, forces, provided, shelter, and, weapons, to, the, khmer, rouge, after, the, insurgency, started, vietnamese, support, for, the, insurgency, made, it, impossible, for, the, cambodian, military, to, effectively, counter, it, for, the, next, two, years, the, insurgency, grew, as, sihanouk, did, very, little, to, stop, it, as, the, insurgency, grew, stronger, the, party, finally, openly, declared, itself, to, be, the, communist, party, of, kampuchea, the, political, appeal, of, the, khmer, rouge, was, increased, as, a, result, of, the, situation, created, by, the, removal, of, sihanouk, as, head, of, state, in, 1970, premier, lon, nol, deposed, sihanouk, with, the, support, of, the, national, assembly, sihanouk, who, was, in, exile, in,

grunk, backed, by, china, in, 1970, alone, the, chinese, reportedly, gave, 400, tons, of, military, aid, to, the, united, front, although, thoroughly, aware, of, the, weakness, of, lon, nol, s, forces, and, loath, to, commit, american, military, force, to, the, new, conflict, in, any, form, other, than, air, power, the, nixon, administration, supported, the, newly, proclaimed, khmer,

khmer, rouge, also, established, liberated, areas, in, the, south, and, the, southwestern, parts, of, the, country, where, they, operated, independently, of, the, north, vietnamese, after, sihanouk, showed, his, support, for, the, khmer, rouge, by, visiting, them, in, the, field, their, ranks, swelled, from, 6, 000, to, 50, 000, fighters, many, of, the, new, recruits, for, the, khmer, rouge, were, apolitical, peasants, who, fought, in, support, of, the, king, not, for, communism, of, which, they, had, little, understanding, sihanouk, s, popular, support, in, rural, cambodia, allowed, the, khmer, rouge, to, extend, its, power, and, influence, to, the, point, that, by, 1973, it, exercised, de, facto, control, over, the, majority, of, cambodian, territory, although, only, a, minority, of, its, population, by, 1975, with, the, lon, nol, government, running, out, of, ammunition, it, was, clear, that, it, was, only, a, matter, of, time, before, the, government, would, collapse, on, 17, april, 1975, there, was, the, fall, of, phnom, penh, as, the, khmer, rouge, captured, the, capital, during, the, civil, war, unparalleled, atrocities, were, executed, on, both, sides, 90, while, the, civil, war, was, brutal, its, estimated, death, toll, has, been, revised, downwards, over, time, the, relationship, between, the, massive, carpet, bombing, of, cambodia, by, the, united, states, and, the, growth, of, the, khmer, rouge, in, terms, of, recruitment, and, popular, support, has, been, a, matter, of, interest, to, historians, some, scholars, including, michael, ignatieff, adam, jones, and, greg, grandin, have, cited, the, united, states, intervention, and, bombing, campaign, spanning, 1965, 1973, as, a, significant, factor, which, led, to, increased, support, for, the, khmer, rouge, among, the, cambodian, peasantry, according, to, ben, kiernan, the, khmer, rouge, would, not, have, won, power, without, u, s, economic, and, military, destabilization, of, cambodia, it, used, the, bombing, s, devastation, and, massacre, of, civilians, as, recruitment, propaganda, and, as, an, excuse, for, its, brutal, radical, policies, and, its, purge, of, moderate, communists, and, sihanoukists, 16, 19, pol, pot, biographer, david, p, chandler, writes, that, the, bombing, had, the, effect, the, americans, wanted, it, broke, the, communist, encirclement, of, phnom, penh, but, it, also, accelerated, the, collapse, of, rural, society, and, increased, social, polarization, 96, 8, peter, rodman, and, michael, lind, claim, that, the, united, states, intervention, saved, the, lon, nol, regime, from, collapse, in, 1970, and, 1973, craig, etcheson, acknowledged, that, u, s, intervention, increased, recruitment, for, the, khmer, rouge, but, disputed, that, it, was, a, primary, cause, of, the, khmer, rouge, victory, william, shawcross, writes, that, the, united, states, bombing, and, ground, incursion, plunged, cambodia, into, the, chaos, that, sihanouk, had, worked, for, years, to, avoid, 92, 100, 106, 112, by, 1973, vietnamese, support, of, the, khmer, rouge, had, largely, disappeared, on, the, other, hand, the, ccp, largely, armed, and, trained, the, khmer, rouge, including, pol, pot, both, during, the, cambodian, civil, war, and, the, years, afterward, in, 1970, alone, the, chinese, reportedly, gave, 400, tons, of, military, aid, to, the, national, united,

estimated, that, at, least, 90, of, the, foreign, aid, to, khmer, rouge, came, from, china, with, 1975, alone, seeing, us, 1, billion, in, interest, free, economic, and, military, aid, and, us, 20,

however, to, counter, the, power, of, the, soviet, union, and, vietnam, a, group, of, countries, including, china, the, united, states, thailand, as, well, as, some, western, countries, supported, the, khmer, rouge, dominated, coalition, government, of, democratic, kampuchea, to, continue, holding, cambodia, s, seat, in, the, united, nations, which, was, held, until, 1993, after, the, cold,

seat, at, the, united, nations, and, foreign, relations, with, more, than, 70, countries, the, governing, structure, of, democratic, kampuchea, was, split, between, the, state, presidium, headed, by, khieu, samphan, the, cabinet, headed, by, pol, pot, who, was, also, democratic, kampuchea, s, prime, minister, and, the, party, s, own, politburo, and, central, committee, all, were, complicated, by, a, number, of, political, factions, which, existed, in, 1975, the, leadership, of, the, party, centre, the, faction, which, was, headed, by, pol, pot, remained, largely, unchanged, from, the, early, 1960s, to, the, mid, 1990s, its, leaders, were, mostly, from, middle, class, families, and, had, been, educated, at, french, universities, the, second, significant, faction, was, made, up, of, men, who, had, been, active, in, the, pre, 1960, party, and, had, stronger, links, to, vietnam, as, a, result, government, documents, show, that, there, were, several, major, shifts, in, power, between, factions, during, the, period, in, which, the, regime, was, in, control, in, 1975, 1976, there, were, several, powerful, regional, khmer, rouge, leaders, who, maintained, their, own, armies, and, had, different, party, backgrounds, than, the, members, of, the, pol, pot, clique, particularly, so, phim, and, nhim, ros, both, of, whom, were, vice, presidents, of, the, state, presidium, and, members, of, the, politburo, and, central, committee, respectively, 158, a, possible, military, coup, attempt, was, made, in, may, 1976, and, its, leader, was, a, senior, eastern, zone, cadre, named, chan, chakrey, who, had, been, appointed, deputy, secretary, of, the, army, s, general, staff, a, reorganisation, that, occurred, in, september, 1976, during, which, pol, pot, was, demoted, in, the, state, presidium, was, later, presented, as, an, attempted, pro, vietnamese, coup, by, the, party, center, 158, over, the, next, two, years, so, phim, nhim, ros, vorn, vet, and, many, other, figures, who, had, been, associated, with, the, pre, 1960, party, were, arrested, and, executed, 158, phim, s, execution, was, followed, by, that, of, the, majority, of, the, cadres, and, much, of, the, population,

or, three, days, some, witnesses, said, they, were, told, that, the, evacuation, was, because, of, the, threat, of, american, bombing, and, they, were, also, told, that, they, did, not, have, to, lock, their, houses, since, the, khmer, rouge, would, take, care, of, everything, until, they, returned, if, people, refused, to, evacuate, they, would, immediately, be, killed, and, their, homes, would, be, burned, to, the, ground, the, evacuees, were, sent, on, long, marches, to, the, countryside, which, killed, thousands, of, children, elderly, people, and, sick, people, 251, 310, these, were, not, the, first, evacuations, of, civilian, populations, by, the, khmer, rouge, because, similar, evacuations, of, populations, without, possessions, had, been, occurring, on, a, smaller, scale, since, the, early, 1970s, 251, 310, on, arrival, at, the, villages, to, which, they, had, been, assigned, evacuees, were, required, to, write, brief, autobiographical, essays, the, essay, s, content,

traditional, medicine, instead, and, placed, medical, care, in, the, hands, of, cadres, who, were, only, given, rudimentary, training, the, famine, forced, labour, and, lack, of, access, to, appropriate, services, led, to, a, high, number, of, deaths, 251, 310, khmer, rouge, economic, policies, took, a, similarly, extreme, course, officially, trade, was, restricted, to, bartering, between, communes, a, policy, which, the, regime, developed, in, order, to, enforce, self, reliance, 62, banks, were, raided, and, all, currency, and, records, were, destroyed, by, fire, thus, eliminating, any, claim, to, funds, after, 1976, the, regime, reinstated, discussion, of, export, in, the, period, after, the, disastrous, effects, of, its, planning, began, to, become, apparent, 58, commercial, fishing, was, banned, in, 1976, the, regulations, made, by, the, angkar, the, organisation, which, was, the, ruling, body, also, had, effects, on, the, traditional, cambodian, family, unit, the, regime, was, primarily, interested, in, increasing, the, young, population, and, one, of, the, strictest, regulations, prohibited, sex, outside, marriage, which, was, punishable, by, execution, 186, 7, the, khmer, rouge, followed, a, morality, based, on, an, idealised, conception, of, the, attitudes, of, prewar, rural, cambodia, 186, marriage, required, permission, from, the, authorities, and, the, khmer, rouge, were, strict, giving, permission, to, marry, only, to, people, of, the, same, class, and, level, of, education, such, rules, were, applied, even, more, strictly, to, party, cadres, 186, while, some, refugees, spoke, of, families, being, deliberately, broken, up, this, appears, to, have, referred, mainly, to, the, traditional, cambodian, extended, family, unit, which, the, regime, actively, sought, to, destroy, in, favour, of, small, nuclear, units, of, parents, and, children, 188, the, regime, promoted, arranged, marriages, particularly, between, party, cadres, while, some, academics, such, as, michael, vickery, have, noted, that, arranged, marriages, were, also, a, feature, of, rural, cambodia, prior, to, 1975, those, conducted, by, the, khmer, rouge, regime, often, involved, people, unfamiliar, to, each, other, as, well, as, reflecting, the, khmer, rouge, obsession, with, production, and, reproduction, such, marriages, were, designed, to, increase, people, s, dependency, on, the, regime, by, undermining, existing, family, and, other, loyalties, it, is, often, concluded, that, the, khmer, rouge, regime, promoted, functional, illiteracy, this, statement, is, not, completely, incorrect, but, it, is, quite, inaccurate, the, khmer, rouge, wanted, to, eliminate, all, traces, of, cambodia, s, imperialist, past, and, its, previous, culture, was, one, of, them, the, khmer, rouge, did, not, want, the, cambodian, people, to, be, completely, ignorant, and, primary, education, was, provided, to, them, nevertheless, the, khmer, rouge, s, policies, dramatically, reduced, the, cambodian, population, s, cultural, inflow, as, well, as, its, knowledge, and, creativity, the, khmer, rouge, s, goal, was, to, gain, full, control, of, all, of, the, information, that, the, cambodian, people, received, and, spread, revolutionary, culture, among, the, masses, education, came, to, a, virtual, standstill, in, democratic, kampuchea, 185, irrespective, of, central, policies, most, local, cadres, considered, higher, education, useless, and, as, a, result, they, were, suspicious, of, those, who, had, received, it, 185, the, regime, abolished, all, literary, schooling, above, primary, grades, ostensibly, focusing, on, basic, literacy, instead, 183, in, practice, primary, schools, were, not, set, up, in, many, areas, because, of, the, extreme, disruptions, which, had, been, caused, by, the, regime, s, takeover, and, most, ordinary, people, especially, new, people, felt, that, their, children, were, taught, nothing, worthwhile, in, those, schools, which, still, existed, the, exception, was, the, eastern, zone, which, until, 1976, was, run, by, cadres, who, were, closely, connected, with, vietnam, rather, than, the, party, centre, where, a, more, organised, system, seems, to, have, existed, under, which, children, were, given, extra, rations, taught, by, teachers, who, were, drawn, from, the, base, people, and, given, a, limited, number, of, official, textbooks, 184, beyond, primary, education, technical, courses, were, taught, in, factories, to, students, who, were, drawn, from, the, favoured, base, people, 184, there, was, a, general, reluctance, to, increase, people, s, education, in, democratic, kampuchea, and, in, some, districts, cadres, were, known, to, kill, people, who, boasted, about, their, educational, accomplishments, and, it, was, considered, bad, form, for, people, to, allude, to, any, special, technical, training, 185, based, on, a, speech, which, pol, pot, made, in, 1978, it, appears, that, he, may, have, ultimately, envisaged, that, illiterate, students, with, approved, poor, peasant, backgrounds, could, become, trained, engineers, within, ten, years, by, doing, a, lot, of, targeted, studying, along, with, a, lot, of, practical, work, 185, the, khmer, language, has, a, complex, system, of, usages, to, define, speakers, rank, and, social, status, during, the, rule, of, the, khmer, rouge, these, usages, were, abolished, people, were, encouraged, to, call, each, other, friend, mitt, and, to, avoid, traditional, signs, of, deference, such, as, bowing, or, folding, the, hands, in, salutation, known, as, sampeah, language, was, also, transformed, in, other, ways, the, khmer, rouge, invented, new, terms, in, keeping, with, the, regime, s, theories, on, khmer, identity, the, majority, of, new, words, were, coined, with, reference, to, pali, or, sanskrit, terms, while, chinese, and, vietnamese, language, borrowings, were, discouraged, people, were, told, to, forge, lot, dam, a, new, revolutionary, character, that, they, were, the, instruments, opokar, of, the, ruling, body, known, as, angkar, the, organisation, and, that, nostalgia, for, pre, revolutionary, times, chheu, satek, arom, or, memory, sickness, could, result, in, execution, acting, through, the, santebal, the, khmer, rouge, arrested, tortured, and, eventually, executed, anyone, who, was, suspected, of, belonging, to, several, categories, of, supposed, enemies, the, santebal, established, over, 150, prisons, for, political, opponents, tuol, sleng, is, a, former, high, school, that, was, turned, into, the, santebal, headquarters, and, interrogation, center, for, the, highest, value, political, prisoners, tuol, sleng, was, operated, by, the, santebal, commander, khang, khek, ieu, more, commonly, known, as, comrade, duch, together, with, his, subordinates, mam, nai, and, tang, sin, hean, 3, according, to, ben, kiernan, all, but, seven, of, the, twenty, thousand, tuol, sleng, prisoners, were, executed, 464, the, buildings, of, tuol, sleng, have, been, preserved, as, they, were, left, when, the, khmer, rouge, were, driven, out, in, 1979, several, of, the, rooms, are, now, lined, with, thousands, of, black, and, white, photographs, of, prisoners, that, were, taken, by, the, khmer, rouge, 74, on, 7, august, 2014, when, sentencing, two, former, khmer, rouge, leaders, to, life, imprisonment, cambodian, judge, nil, nonn, said, there, was, evidence, of, a, widespread, and, systematic, attack, against, the, civilian, population, of, cambodia, he, said, the, leaders, nuon, chea, the, regime, s, chief, ideologue, and, former, deputy, to, late, leader, pol, pot, and, khieu, samphan, the, former, head, of, state, together, in, a, joint, criminal, enterprise, were, involved, in, murder, extermination, political, persecution, and, other, inhumane, acts, related, to, the, mass, eviction, of, city, dwellers, and, executions, of, enemy, soldiers, in, november, 2018, the, trial, convicted, nuon, chea, and, khieu, samphan, of, crimes, against, humanity, and, genocide, against, the, vietnamese, while, nuon, chea, was, also, found, guilty, of, genocide, relating, to, the, chams, according, to, a, 2001, academic, source, the, most, widely, accepted, estimates, of, excess, deaths, under, the, khmer, rouge, range, from, 1, 5, million, to, 2, million, although, figures, as, low, as, 1, million, and, as, high, as, 3, million, have, been, cited, conventionally, accepted, estimates, of, executions, range, from, 500, 000, to, 1, million, a, third, to, one, half, of, excess, mortality, during, the, period, 105, a, 2013, academic, source, citing, research, from, 2009, indicates, that, execution, may, have, accounted, for, as, much, as, 60, of, the, total, with, 23, 745, mass, graves, containing, approximately, 1, 3, million, suspected, victims, of, execution, historian, ben, kiernan, estimates, that, 1, 671, million, to, 1, 871, million, cambodians, died, as, a, result, of, khmer, rouge, policy, or, between, 21, and, 24, of, cambodia, s, 1975, population, a, study, by, french, demographer, marek, sliwinski, calculated, nearly, 2, million, unnatural, deaths, under, the, khmer, rouge, out, of, a, 1975, cambodian, population, of, 7, 8, million, 33, 5, of, cambodian, men, died, under, the, khmer, rouge, compared, to, 15, 7, of, cambodian, women, researcher, craig, etcheson, of, the, documentation, center, of, cambodia, dc, cam, suggests, that, the, death, toll, was, between, 2, million, and, 2, 5, million, with, a, most, likely, figure, of, 2, 2, million, after, five, years, of, researching, mass, grave, sites, he, estimated, that, they, contained, 1, 38, million, suspected, victims, of, execution, although, considerably, higher, than, earlier, and, more, widely, accepted, estimates, of, khmer, rouge, executions, etcheson, argues, that, these, numbers, are, plausible, given, the, nature, of, the, mass, grave, and, dc, cam, s, methods, which, are, more, likely, to, produce, an, under, count, of, bodies, rather, than, an, over, estimate, demographer, patrick, heuveline, estimated, that, between, 1, 17, million, and, 3, 42, million, cambodians, died, unnatural, deaths, between, 1970, and, 1979, with, between, 150, 000, and, 300, 000, of, those, deaths, occurring, during, the, civil, war, heuveline, s, central, estimate, is, 2, 52, million, excess, deaths, of, which, 1, 4, million, were, the, direct, result, of, violence, 102, 4, despite, being, based, on, a, house, to, house, survey, of, cambodians, the, estimate, of, 3, 3, million, deaths, promulgated, by, the, khmer, rouge, s, successor, regime, the, people, s, republic, of, kampuchea, prk, is, generally, considered, to, be, an, exaggeration, among, other, methodological, errors, the, prk, authorities, added, the, estimated, number, of, victims, that, had, been, found, in, the, partially, exhumed, mass, graves, to, the, raw, survey, results, meaning, that, some, victims, would, have, been, double, counted, an, additional, 300, 000, cambodians, starved, to, death, between, 1979, and, 1980, largely, as, a, result, of, the, after, effects, of, khmer, rouge, policy, 124, while, the, period, from, 1975, to, 1979, is, commonly, associated, with, the, phrase, the, cambodian, genocide, scholars, debate, whether, the, legal, definition, of, the, crime, can, be, applied, generally, 260, while, two, former, leaders, were, convicted, of, genocide, this, was, for, treatment, of, ethnic, and, religious, minorities, the, vietnamese, and, cham, the, death, toll, of, these, two, groups, approximately, 100, 000, people, is, roughly, 5, of, the, generally, accepted, total, of, two, million, the, treatment, of, these, groups, can, be, seen, to, fall, under, the, legal, definition, of, genocide, as, they, were, targeted, on, the, basis, of, their, religion, or, ethnicity, the, vast, majority, of, deaths, were, of, the, khmer, ethnic, group, which, was, not, a, target, of, the, khmer, rouge, the, deaths, occurring, as, a, result, of, targeting, these, khmer, whether, it, was, the, new, people, or, enemies, of, the, regime, was, based, on, political, distinctions, rather, than, ethnic, or, religious, in, an, interview, conducted, in, 2018, historian, david, p, chandler, states, that, crimes, against, humanity, was, the, term, that, best, fit, the, atrocities, of, the, regime, and, that, some, attempts, to, characterise, the, majority, of, the, killings, as, genocide, was, flawed, and, at, times, politicised, hou, yuon, was, one, of, the, first, senior, leaders, to, be, purged, the, khmer, rouge, originally, reported, that, he, had, been, killed, in, the, final, battles, for, phnom, penh, but, he, was, apparently, executed, in, late, 1975, or, early, 1976, 202, in, late, 1975, numerous, cambodian, intellectuals, professionals, and, students, returned, from, overseas, to, support, the, revolution, these, returnees, were, treated, with, suspicion, and, made, to, undergo, reeducation, while, some, were, sent, straight, to, tuol, sleng, 272, in, 1976, the, center, announced, the, start, of, the, socialist, revolution, and, ordered, the, elimination, of, class, enemies, this, resulted, in, the, expulsion, and, execution, of, numerous, people, within, the, party, and, army, who, were, deemed, to, be, of, the, wrong, class, 265,

282, the, center, also, ordered, troops, from, the, eastern, and, central, zones, to, purge, the, northern, zone, killing, or, arresting, numerous, cadres, 264, 5, at, the, end, of, 1976, following,

to, escape, the, zone, and, try, to, seek, refuge, in, thailand, but, was, met, with, gunfire, by, the, thai, army, who, then, raped, the, khmer, women, and, children, while, they, were, hiding, near,

supposed, to, stop, the, communists, these, preventative, acts, included, the, deployment, of, military, troops, and, the, establishment, of, other, institutions, like, the, untac, vietnam, s, victory, was, supported, by, the, soviet, union, and, had, significant, ramifications, for, the, region, the, people, s, republic, of, china, launched, a, punitive, invasion, of, northern, vietnam, but, then, retreated, with, both, sides, claiming, victory, china, the, united, states, and, the, asean, countries, sponsored, the, creation, and, the, military, operations, of, a, cambodian, government, in, exile, known, as, the, coalition, government, of, democratic, kampuchea, which, included, the, khmer, rouge, the, republican, khmer, people, s, national, liberation, front, and, the, royalist, funcinpec, party, 201, 21, eastern, and, central, cambodia, were, firmly, under, the, control, of, vietnam, and, its, cambodian, allies, by, 1980, while, the, western, part, of, the, country, continued, to, be, a, battlefield, throughout, the, 1980s, and, millions, of, land, mines, were, sown, across, the, countryside, the, khmer, rouge, still, led, by, pol, pot, was, the, strongest, of, the, three, rebel, groups, in, the, coalition, government, which, received, extensive, military, aid, from, china, britain, and, the, united, states, and, intelligence, from, the, thai, military, great, britain, and, the, united, states, in, particular, gave, aid, to, the, two, non, khmer, rouge, members, of, the, coalition, in, an, attempt, to, broaden, its, support, base, the, khmer, rouge, formed, the, patriotic, and, democratic, front, of, the, great, national, union, of, kampuchea, in, 1979, in, 1981, the, khmer, rouge, went, so, far, as, to, officially, renounce, communism, and, somewhat, moved, their, ideological, emphasis, to, nationalism, and, anti, vietnamese, rhetoric, instead, some, analysts, argue, that, this, change, meant, little, in, practice, because, according, to, historian, kelvin, rowley, the, cpk, propaganda, had, always, relied, on, nationalist, rather, than, revolutionary, appeals, pol, pot, relinquished, the, khmer, rouge, leadership, to, khieu, samphan, in, 1985, however, he, continued, to, be, the, driving, force, behind, the, khmer, rouge, insurgency, giving, speeches, to, his, followers, journalist, nate, thayer, who, spent, some, time, with, the, khmer, rouge, during, that, period, commented, that, despite, the, international, community, s, near, universal, condemnation, of, the, khmer, rouge, s, brutal, rule, a, considerable, number, of, cambodians, in, khmer, rouge, controlled, areas, seemed, genuinely, to, support, pol, pot, while, vietnam, proposed, to, withdraw, from, cambodia, in, return, for, a, political, settlement, that, would, exclude, the, khmer, rouge, from, power, the, rebel, coalition, government, as, well, as, asean, china, and, the, united, states, insisted, that, such, a, condition, was, unacceptable, nevertheless, vietnam, declared, in, 1985, that, it, would, complete, the, withdrawal, of, its, forces, from, cambodia, by, 1990, and, it, did, so, in, 1989, having, allowed, the, cambodian, people, s, party, government, that, it, had, installed, there, to, consolidate, its, rule, and, gain, sufficient, military, strength, after, a, decade, of, inconclusive, conflict, the, pro, vietnamese, cambodian, government, and, the, rebel, coalition, signed, a, treaty, in, 1991, calling, for, elections, and, disarmament, however, the, khmer, rouge, resumed, fighting, in, 1992, boycotted, the, election, and, in, the, following, year, rejected, its, results, it, began, fighting, the, cambodian, coalition, government, which, included, the, former, vietnamese, backed, communists, headed, by, hun, sen, as, well, as, the, khmer, rouge, s, former, non, communist, and, monarchist, allies, notably, prince, rannaridh, ieng, sary, led, a, mass, defection, from, the, khmer, rouge, in, 1996, with, half, of, its, remaining, soldiers, about, 4, 000, switching, to, the, government, side, and, ieng, sary, becoming, leader, of, pailin, province, 515, a, conflict, between, the, two, main, participants, in, the, ruling, coalition, caused, in, 1997, prince, rannaridh, to, seek, support, from, some, of, the, khmer, rouge, leaders, while, refusing, to, have, any, dealings, with, pol, pot, this, resulted, in, bloody, factional, fighting, among, the, khmer, rouge, leaders, ultimately, leading, to, pol, pot, s, trial, and, imprisonment, by, the, khmer, rouge, pol, pot, died, in, april, 1998, 186, khieu, samphan, and, nuon, chea, surrendered, in, december, 1998, on, 29, december, 1998, leaders, of, the, khmer, rouge, apologised, for, the, 1970s, genocide, by, 1999, most, members, had, surrendered, or, been, captured, in, december, 1999, ta, mok, and, the, remaining, leaders, surrendered, and, the, khmer, rouge, effectively, ceased, to, exist, cambodia, has, been, described, as, the, black, sheep, of, south, east, asia, because, extremism, is, condoned, in, a, country, which, is, characterized, by, very, weak, economic, growth, and, extensive, poverty, 99, both, demographically, and, economically, cambodia, has, gradually, recovered, from, the, rule, of, the, khmer, rouge, regime, but, the, psychological, scars, affect, many, cambodian, families, and, they, also, affect, many, migr, cambodian, communities, it, is, noteworthy, that, cambodia, has, a, very, young, population, and, by, 2003, three, quarters, of, cambodians, were, too, young, to, remember, the, khmer, rouge, era, nonetheless, their, generation, is, affected, by, the, traumas, of, the, past, members, of, this, younger, generation, may, only, know, about, the, khmer, rouge, through, word, of, mouth, from, their, parents, and, elders, in, part, young, cambodians, lack, knowledge, about, the, khmer, rouge, because, the, cambodian, government, does, not, require, educators, to, teach, cambodian, children, about, the, khmer, rouge, s, atrocities, in, cambodian, schools, however, cambodia, s, education, ministry, started, to,
