preparations, for, the, battle, gathering, the, troops, and, engaging, in, diplomatic, maneuvers, both, sides, sent, letters, and, envoys, accusing, each, other, of, various, wrongdoings, and, threats, to, christendom, wenceslaus, who, received, a, gift, of, 60, 000, florins, from, the, knights, declared, that, samogitia, rightfully, belonged, to, the, knights, and, only, dobrzy, land,

sigismund, attempted, to, break, the, polish, lithuanian, alliance, by, offering, vytautas, a, king, s, crown, vytautas, s, acceptance, of, such, a, crown, would, violate, the, terms, of, the, ostr, w, agreement, and, create, polish, lithuanian, discord, at, the, same, time, vytautas, managed, to, obtain, a, truce, from, the, livonian, order, by, december, 1409, jogaila, and, vytautas, had, agreed, on, a, common, strategy, their, armies, would, unite, into, a, single, massive, force, and, march, together, towards, marienburg, malbork, capital, of, the, teutonic, knights, the, knights, who, took, a, defensive, position, did, not, expect, a, joint, attack, and, were, preparing, for, a, dual, invasion, by, the, poles, along, the, vistula, river, towards, danzig, gda, sk, and, by, the, lithuanians, along, the, neman, river, towards, ragnit, neman, to, counter, this, perceived, threat, ulrich, von, jungingen, concentrated, his, forces, in, schwetz, wiecie, a, central, location, from, where, troops, could, respond, to, an, invasion, from, any, direction, rather, quickly, to, keep, the, plans, secret, and, misguide, the, knights, jogaila, and, vytautas, organised, several, raids, into, border, territories, thus, forcing, the, knights, to, keep, their, troops, in, place, the, first, stage, of, the, grunwald, campaign, was, gathering, all, polish, lithuanian, troops, at, czerwinsk, a, designated, meeting, point, about, 80, km, 50, mi, from, the, prussian, border, where, the, joint, army, crossed, the, vistula, over, a, floating, bridge, this, maneuver, which, required, precision, and, intense, coordination, among, multi, ethnic, forces, was, accomplished, in, about, a, week, from, 24, to, 30, june, 1410, after, the, crossing, masovian, troops, under, siemowit, iv, and, janusz, i, joined, the, polish, lithuanian, army, the, massive, force, began, its, march, north, towards, marienburg, malbork, capital, of, prussia, on, 3, july, the, prussian, border, was, crossed, on, 9, july, as, soon, as, ulrich, von, jungingen, grasped, polish, lithuanian, intentions, he, left, 3, 000, men, at, schwetz, wiecie, under, heinrich, von, plauen, and, marched, the, main, forces, to, organise, a, line, of, defence, on, the, drewenz, river, drw, ca, near, kauernik, kurz, tnik, on, 11, july, jogaila, decided, against, crossing, the, river, at, such, a, strong, defensible, position, the, army, would, instead, bypass, the, river, crossing, by, turning, east, towards, its, sources, where, no, other, major, rivers, separated, his, army, from, marienburg, the, teutonic, army, followed, the, drewenz, river, north, crossed, it, near, l, bau, lubawa, and, then, moved, east, in, parallel, with, the, polish, lithuanian, army, the, latter, ravaged, the, village, of, gilgenburg, d, br, wno, von, jungingen, was, so, enraged, by, the, atrocities, that, he, swore, to, defeat, the, invaders, in, battle, the, battle, of, grunwald, took, place, on, 15, july, 1410, between, the, villages, of, grunwald, tannenberg, st, bark, and, ludwigsdorf, odwigowo, modern, estimates, of, number, of, troops, involved, range, from, 16, 500, to, 39, 000, polish, lithuanian, and, 11, 000, to, 27, 000, teutonic, men, the, polish, lithuanian, army, was, an, amalgam, of, nationalities, and, religions, the, roman, catholic, polish, lithuanian, troops, fought, side, by, side, with, pagan, samogitians, eastern, orthodox, ruthenians, and, muslim, tatars, twenty, two, different, peoples, mostly, germanic, joined, the, teutonic, side, the, knights, hoped, to, provoke, poles, or, lithuanians, to, attack, first, and, sent, two, swords, known, as, grunwald, swords, to, assist, jogaila, and, vytautas, in, battle, lithuanians, attacked, first, but, after, more, than, an, hour, of, heavy, fighting, the, lithuanian, light, cavalry, started, a, full, retreat, the, reason, for, the, retreat, whether, it, was, a, retreat, of, the, defeated, force, or, a, preconceived, maneuver, remains, a, topic, of, academic, debate, heavy, fighting, began, between, polish, and, teutonic, forces, and, even, reached, the, royal, camp, of, jogaila, one, knight, charged, directly, against, king, jogaila, who, was, saved, by, royal, secretary, zbigniew, ole, nicki, the, lithuanians, returned, to, the, battle, as, grand, master, von, jungingen, attempted, to, break, through, the, lithuanian, lines, he, was, killed, surrounded, and, leaderless, the, teutonic, knights, began, to, retreat, towards, their, camp, in, hopes, to, organize, a, defensive, wagon, fort, however, the, defense, was, soon, broken, and, the, camp, was, ravaged, and, according, to, an, eyewitness, account, more, knights, died, there, than, in, the, battlefield, the, defeat, of, the, teutonic, knights, was, resounding, about, 8, 000, teuton, soldiers, were, killed, and, an, additional, 14, 000, were, taken, captive, most, of, the, brothers, of, the, order, were, killed, including, most, of, the, teutonic, leadership, the, highest, ranking, teutonic, official, to, escape, the, battle, was, werner, von, tettinger, komtur, of, elbing, elbl, g, most, of, the, captive, commoners, and, mercenaries, were, released, shortly, after, the, battle, on, condition, that, they, report, to, krak, w, on, 11, november, 1410, the, nobles, were, kept, in, captivity, and, high, ransoms, were, demanded, for, each, after, the, battle, the, polish, and, lithuanian, forces, delayed, their, attack, on, the, teutonic, capital, in, marienburg, malbork, by, staying, on, the, battlefield, for, three, days, and, then, marching, an, average, of, only, about, 15, km, 9, 3, mi, per, day, the, main, forces, did, not, reach, heavily, fortified, marienburg, until, 26, july, this, delay, gave, heinrich, von, plauen, enough, time, to, organize, a, defense, polish, historian, pawe, jasienica, speculated, that, this, was, likely, an, intentional, move, by, jagie, o, who, together, with, vytautas, preferred, to, keep, the, humbled, but, not, decimated, order, in, play, as, to, not, upset, the, balance, of, power, between, poland, which, would, most, likely, acquire, most, of, the, order, possessions, if, it, was, totally, defeated, and, lithuania, but, a, lack, of, primary, sources, precludes, a, definitive, explanation, jogaila, meanwhile, also, sent, his, troops, to, other, teutonic, fortresses, which, often, surrendered, without, resistance, including, the, major, cities, of, danzig, gda, sk, thorn, toru, and, elbing, elbl, g, only, eight, castles, remained, in, teutonic, hands, the, polish, and, lithuanian, besiegers, of, marienburg, were, not, prepared, for, a, long, term, engagement, suffering, from, lack, of, ammunition, low, morale, and, an, epidemic, of, dysentery, the, knights, appealed, to, their, allies, for, help, and, sigismund, of, hungary, wenceslaus, king, of, the, romans, and, the, livonian, order, promised, financial, aid, and, reinforcements, the, siege, of, marienburg, was, lifted, on, 19, september, the, polish, lithuanian, forces, left, garrisons, in, fortresses, that, were, captured, or, surrendered, and, returned, home, however, the, knights, quickly, recaptured, most, of, the, castles, by, the, end, of, october, only, four, teutonic, castles, along, the, border, remained, in, polish, hands, jogaila, raised, a, fresh, army, and, dealt, another, defeat, to, the, knights, in, the, battle, of, koronowo, on, 10, october, 1410, following, other, brief, engagements, both, sides, agreed, to, negotiate, the, peace, of, thorn, was, signed, on, 1, february, 1411, under, its, terms, the, knights, ceded, the, dobrin, land, dobrzy, land, to, poland, and, agreed, to, resign, their, claims, to, samogitia, during, the, lifetimes, of, jogaila, and, vytautas, although, another, two, wars, the, hunger, war, of, 1414, and, the, gollub, war, of, 1422, would, be, waged, before, the, treaty, of, melno, permanently, resolved, the, territorial, disputes, the, poles, and, lithuanians, were, unable, to, translate, the, military, victory, into, territorial, or, diplomatic, gains, however, the, peace, of, thorn, imposed, a, heavy, financial, burden, on, the, knights, from, which, they, never, recovered, they, had, to, pay, an, indemnity, in, silver, estimated, at, ten, times, the, annual, income, of, the, king, of, england, in, four, annual, installments, to, meet, the, payments, the, knights, borrowed, heavily, confiscated, gold, and, silver, from, churches, and, increased, taxes, two, major, prussian, cities, danzig, gda, sk, and, thorn, toru, revolted, against, the, tax, increases, the, defeat, at, grunwald, left, the, teutonic, knights, with, few, forces, to, defend, their, remaining, territories, since, both, poland, and, lithuania, were, now, christian, countries, the, knights, had, difficulties, recruiting, new, volunteer, crusaders, the, grand, masters, then, needed, to, rely, on, mercenary, troops, which, proved, an, expensive, drain, on, their, already, depleted, budget, the, internal, conflicts, economic, decline, and, tax, increases, led, to, unrest, and, the, foundation, of, the, prussian, confederation, or, alliance, against, lordship, in, 1441, that, in, turn, led, to, a, series, of, conflicts, that, culminated, in, the, thirteen, years, war, 1454
