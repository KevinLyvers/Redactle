nubia, nj, u, b, i, nobiin, nob, n, arabic, romanized, an, n, ba, is, a, region, along, the, nile, river, encompassing, the, area, between, the, first, cataract, of, the, nile, south, of, aswan, in, southern, egypt, and, the, confluence, of, the, blue, and, white, niles, in, khartoum, in, central, sudan, or, more, strictly, al, dabbah, it, was, the, seat, of, one, of, the, earliest, civilizations, of, ancient, africa, the, kerma, culture, which, lasted, from, around, 2500, bc, until, its, conquest, by, the, new, kingdom, of, egypt, under, pharaoh, thutmose, i, around, 1500, bc, whose, heirs, ruled, most, of, nubia, for, the, next, 400, years, nubia, was, home, to, several, empires, most, prominently, the, kingdom, of, kush, which, conquered, egypt, in, the, eighth, century, bc, during, the, reign, of, piye, and, ruled, the, country, as, its, 25th, dynasty, to, be, replaced, a, century, later, by, the, native, egyptian, 26th, dynasty, from, the, 3rd, century, bc, to, 3rd, century, ad, northern, nubia, was, invaded, and, annexed, to, egypt, ruled, by, the, greeks, and, romans, this, territory, was, known, in, the, greco, roman, world, as, dodekaschoinos, kush, s, collapse, in, the, fourth, century, ad, was, preceded, by, an, invasion, from, the, ethiopian, kingdom, of, aksum, and, the, rise, of, three, christian, kingdoms, nobatia, makuria, and, alodia, makuria, and, alodia, lasted, for, roughly, a, millennium, their, eventual, decline, started, not, only, the, partition, of, nubia, which, was, split, into, the, northern, half, conquered, by, the, ottomans, and, the, southern, half, by, the, sennar, sultanate, in, the, sixteenth, century, but, also, a, rapid, islamization, and, partial, arabization, of, the, nubian, people, nubia, was, reunited, with, the, khedivate, of, egypt, in, the, nineteenth, century, today, the, region, of, nubia, is, split, between, egypt, and, sudan, the, primarily, archaeological, science, dealing, with, ancient, nubia, is, called, nubiology, historically, the, people, of, nubia, spoke, at, least, two, varieties, of, nubian, languages, a, subfamily, that, includes, nobiin, the, descendant, of, old, nubian, dongolawi, midob, and, several, related, varieties, in, the, northern, part, of, the, nuba, mountains, in, south, kordofan, the, birgid, language, was, spoken, north, of, nyala, in, darfur, but, became, extinct, as, late, as, 1970, however, the, linguistic, identity, of, the, ancient, kerma, culture, of, southern, and, central, nubia, also, known, as, upper, nubia, is, uncertain, some, research, suggests, that, it, belonged, to, the, cushitic, branch, of, the, afroasiatic, languages, while, more, recent, studies, indicate, that, the, kerma, culture, belonged, to, the, eastern, sudanic, branch, of, nilo, saharan, languages, instead, and, that, other, peoples, of, northern, or, lower, nubia, north, of, kerma, such, as, the, c, group, culture, and, the, blemmyes, spoke, cushitic, languages, before, the, spread, of, eastern, sudanic, languages, from, southern, or, upper, nubia, nubia, was, divided, into, three, major, regions, upper, middle, and, lower, nubia, in, reference, to, their, locations, along, the, nile, lower, referred, to, regions, downstream, further, north, and, upper, to, regions, upstream, further, south, lower, nubia, lay, between, the, first, and, the, second, cataracts, within, the, current, borders, of, egypt, middle, nubia, lay, between, the, second, and, the, third, cataracts, and, upper, nubia, lay, south, of, the, third, cataract, archaeological, evidence, attests, to, long, histories, of, fishing, hunting, gathering, and, later, herding, throughout, the, nile, valley, affad, 23, is, an, archaeological, site, located, in, the, affad, region, of, southern, dongola, reach, in, northern, sudan, which, hosts, the, well, preserved, remains, of, prehistoric, camps, relics, of, the, oldest, open, air, hut, in, the, world, and, diverse, hunting, and, gathering, loci, some, 50, 000, years, old, in, southern, nubia, near, modern, khartoum, from, the, ninth, to, the, sixth, millennia, cal, bc, khartoum, mesolithic, fisher, hunter, gatherers, produced, sophisticated, pottery, by, 5000, bc, the, people, who, inhabited, what, is, now, called, nubia, participated, in, the, neolithic, revolution, the, sahara, became, drier, and, people, began, to, domesticate, sheep, goats, and, cattle, saharan, rock, reliefs, depict, scenes, that, have, been, thought, to, suggest, the, presence, of, a, cattle, cult, typical, of, those, seen, throughout, parts, of, eastern, africa, and, the, nile, valley, even, to, this, day, nubian, rock, art, depicts, hunters, using, bows, and, arrows, in, the, neolithic, period, which, is, a, precursor, to, nubian, archer, culture, in, later, times, megaliths, discovered, at, nabta, playa, are, early, examples, of, what, seems, to, be, one, of, the, world, s, first, astronomical, devices, predating, stonehenge, by, almost, 2, 000, years, this, complexity, as, expressed, by, different, levels, of, authority, within, the, society, there, likely, formed, the, basis, for, the, structure, of, both, the, neolithic, society, at, nabta, and, the, old, kingdom, of, egypt, joseph, vogel, wrote, that, the, period, when, sub, saharan, africa, was, most, influential, in, egypt, was, a, time, when, neither, egypt, as, we, understand, it, culturally, nor, the, sahara, as, we, understand, it, geographically, existed, populations, and, cultures, now, found, south, of, the, desert, roamed, far, to, the, north, the, culture, of, upper, egypt, which, became, dynastic, egyptian, civilization, could, fairly, be, called, a, sudanese, transplant, british, africanist, basil, davidson, outlined, that, the, ancient, egyptians, belonged, that, is, not, to, any, specific, egyptian, region, or, near, eastern, heritage, but, to, that, wide, community, of, peoples, who, lived, between, the, red, sea, and, the, atlantic, ocean, shared, a, common, saharan, sudanese, culture, and, drew, their, reinforcements, from, the, same, great, source, even, though, as, time, went, by, they, also, absorbed, a, number, of, wanderers, from, the, near, east, biological, anthropologists, shomarka, keita, and, a, j, boyce, have, stated, that, the, studies, of, crania, from, southern, predynastic, egypt, from, the, formative, period, 4000, 3100, b, c, show, them, usually, to, be, more, similar, to, the, crania, of, ancient, nubians, kushites, saharans, or, modern, groups, from, the, horn, of, africa, than, to, those, of, dynastic, northern, egyptians, or, ancient, or, modern, southern, europeans, archaeological, evidence, has, attested, that, population, settlements, occurred, in, nubia, as, early, as, the, late, pleistocene, era, and, from, the, 5th, millennium, bc, onwards, whereas, there, is, no, or, scanty, evidence, of, human, presence, in, the, egyptian, nile, valley, during, these, periods, which, may, be, due, to, problems, in, site, preservation, several, scholars, have, argued, that, the, african, origins, of, the, egyptian, civilisation, derived, from, pastoral, communities, which, emerged, in, both, the, egyptian, and, sudanese, regions, of, the, nile, valley, in, the, fifth, millennium, bce, dietrich, wildung, 2018, examined, eastern, saharan, pottery, styles, and, sudanese, stone, sculptures, and, suggested, these, artefacts, were, transmitted, across, the, nile, valley, and, influenced, the, pre, dynastic, egyptian, culture, in, the, neolithic, period, the, poorly, known, pre, kerma, culture, existed, in, upper, southern, nubia, on, a, stretch, of, fertile, farmland, just, south, of, the, third, cataract, nubia, has, one, of, the, oldest, civilizations, in, the, world, this, history, is, often, intertwined, with, egypt, to, the, north, 16, around, 3500, bc, the, second, nubian, culture, termed, the, early, a, group, culture, arose, in, lower, nubia, they, were, sedentary, agriculturalists, 6, traded, with, the, egyptians, and, exported, gold, this, trade, is, supported, archaeologically, by, large, amounts, of, egyptian, commodities, deposited, in, the, a, group, graves, the, imports, consisted, of, gold, objects, copper, tools, faience, amulets, and, beads, seals, slate, palettes, stone, vessels, and, a, variety, of, pots, during, this, time, the, nubians, began, creating, distinctive, black, topped, red, pottery, the, a, group, population, have, been, described, as, ethnically, very, similar, to, the, pre, dynastic, egyptians, in, physical, characteristics, around, 3100, bc, the, a, group, transitioned, from, the, early, to, classical, phases, arguably, royal, burials, are, known, only, at, qustul, and, possibly, sayala, 8, during, this, period, the, wealth, of, a, group, kings, rivaled, egyptian, kings, royal, a, group, graves, contained, gold, and, richly, decorated, pottery, 19, some, scholars, believe, nubian, a, group, rulers, and, early, egyptian, pharaohs, used, related, royal, symbols, similarities, in, a, group, nubia, and, upper, egypt, rock, art, support, this, position, scholars, from, the, university, of, chicago, oriental, institute, excavated, at, qustul, near, abu, simbel, in, sudan, in, 1960, 64, and, found, artifacts, which, incorporated, images, associated, with, egyptian, pharaohs, archeologist, bruce, williams, studied, the, artifacts, and, concluded, that, egypt, and, nubia, a, group, culture, shared, the, same, official, culture, participated, in, the, most, complex, dynastic, developments, and, nubia, and, egypt, were, both, part, of, the, great, east, african, substratum, williams, also, wrote, that, qustul, could, well, have, been, the, seat, of, egypt, s, founding, dynasty, david, o, connor, wrote, that, the, qustul, incense, burner, provides, evidence, that, the, a, group, nubian, culture, in, qustul, marked, the, pivotal, change, from, predynastic, to, dynastic, egyptian, monumental, art, however, most, scholars, do, not, agree, with, this, hypothesis, as, more, recent, finds, in, egypt, indicate, that, this, iconography, originated, in, egypt, instead, of, nubia, and, that, the, qustul, rulers, adopted, or, emulated, the, symbols, of, egyptian, pharaohs, according, to, david, wengrow, the, a, group, polity, of, the, late, 4th, millenninum, bce, is, poorly, understood, since, most, of, the, archaeological, remains, are, submerged, underneath, lake, nasser, frank, yurco, also, remarked, that, depictions, of, pharonic, iconography, such, as, the, royal, crowns, horus, falcons, and, victory, scenes, were, concentrated, in, the, upper, egyptian, naqada, culture, and, a, group, nubia, he, further, elaborated, that, egyptian, writing, arose, in, naqadan, upper, egypt, and, a, group, nubia, and, not, in, the, delta, cultures, where, the, direct, western, asian, contact, was, made, further, vitiates, the, mesopotamian, influence, argument, the, archaeological, cemeteries, at, qustul, are, no, longer, available, for, excavations, since, the, flooding, of, lake, nasser, the, earliest, representations, of, pharaonic, iconography, have, been, excavated, from, nag, el, hamdulab, in, aswan, the, extreme, southern, region, of, egypt, which, borders, the, sudan, with, an, estimated, dating, range, between, 3200, and, 3100, bc, writing, developed, in, egypt, around, 3300, bc, in, their, writings, egyptians, referred, to, nubia, as, ta, seti, or, the, land, of, the, bow, as, the, nubians, were, known, to, be, expert, archers, more, recent, and, broader, studies, have, determined, that, the, distinct, pottery, styles, differing, burial, practices, different, grave, goods, and, site, distribution, all, indicate, that, the, naqada, people, and, the, nubian, a, group, people, were, from, different, cultures, kathryn, bard, states, that, naqada, cultural, burials, contain, very, few, nubian, craft, goods, which, suggests, that, while, egyptian, goods, were, exported, to, nubia, and, were, buried, in, a, group, graves, a, group, goods, were, of, little, interest, further, north, according, to, anthropologist, jane, hill, there, is, no, evidence, that, the, pharaohs, of, the, first, dynasty, of, egypt, buried, at, abydos, were, of, nubian, origin, however, several, biological, anthropological, studies, have, shown, the, badarian, and, naqada, people, to, be, closely, related, to, the, nubian, and, other, tropical, african, populations, also, the, proto, dynastic, kings, emerged, from, the, naqada, region, a, uniform, culture, of, nomadic, herders, called, the, gash, group, existed, from, 3000, to, 1500, bc, to, the, east, and, west, of, nubia, 8, in, lower, nubia, the, a, group, moved, from, the, classical, to, terminal, phase, at, this, time, kings, at, qustul, likely, ruled, all, of, lower, nubia, and, demonstrated, the, political, centralization, of, nubian, society, 21, the, a, group, culture, came, to, an, end, sometime, between, 3100, and, 2900, bc, when, it, was, apparently, destroyed, by, the, first, dynasty, rulers, of, egypt, there, are, no, records, of, settlement, in, lower, nubia, for, the, next, 600, years, old, kingdom, egyptian, dynasties, 4th, to, 6th, controlled, uninhabited, lower, nubia, and, raided, upper, nubia, the, pre, kerma, developed, into, the, middle, phase, kerma, group, some, a, group, people, transitioning, to, c, group, settled, the, area, and, co, existed, with, the, pre, kerma, group, 25, like, other, nubian, groups, the, two, groups, made, an, abundance, of, red, pottery, with, black, tops, though, each, group, made, different, shapes, 29, traces, of, the, c, group, in, upper, nubia, vanish, by, 2000, bc, and, kerma, culture, began, to, dominate, upper, nubia, 25, the, power, of, an, independent, upper, nubia, increased, around, 1700, bc, and, upper, nubia, dominated, lower, nubia, 25, an, egyptian, official, harkhuf, mentions, that, irtjet, setjet, and, wawat, all, combined, under, a, single, ruler, by, 1650, bc, egyptian, texts, started, to, refer, to, only, two, kingdoms, in, nubia, kush, and, shaat, 32, 38, kush, was, centered, at, kerma, and, shaat, was, centered, on, sai, island, 38, bonnet, posits, that, kush, actually, ruled, all, of, upper, nubia, since, royal, graves, were, much, larger, in, kush, than, shaat, and, egyptian, texts, other, than, the, execration, lists, only, refer, to, kush, and, not, shaat, 38, 39, c, group, nubians, resettled, lower, nubia, by, 2400, bc, 25, as, trade, between, egypt, and, nubia, increased, so, did, wealth, and, stability, nubia, was, divided, into, a, series, of, small, kingdoms, there, is, debate, over, whether, the, c, group, people, who, flourished, from, 2500, bc, to, 1500, bc, were, another, internal, evolution, or, invaders, o, connor, states, a, transition, from, a, group, into, a, later, culture, the, c, group, can, be, traced, and, the, c, group, culture, was, typical, of, lower, nubia, from, 2400, to, 1650, bc, 25, although, they, lived, in, close, proximity, to, each, other, nubians, did, not, acculturate, much, to, egyptian, culture, notable, exceptions, include, c, group, nubians, during, the, 15th, dynasty, isolated, nubian, communities, in, egypt, and, some, bowmen, communities, 56, c, group, pottery, is, characterized, by, all, over, incised, geometric, lines, with, white, infill, and, impressed, imitations, of, basketry, lower, nubia, was, controlled, by, egypt, from, 2000, to, 1700, bc, and, upper, nubia, from, 1700, to, 1525, bc, from, 2200, to, 1700, bc, the, pan, grave, culture, appeared, in, lower, nubia, 20, some, of, the, people, were, likely, the, medjay, m, arriving, from, the, desert, east, of, the, nile, river, one, feature, of, pan, grave, culture, was, shallow, grave, burial, the, pan, grave, and, c, group, definitely, interacted, pan, grave, pottery, is, characterized, by, more, limited, incised, lines, than, the, c, group, s, and, generally, have, interspersed, undecorated, spaces, within, the, geometric, schemes, in, 2300, bc, nubia, was, first, mentioned, in, old, kingdom, egyptian, accounts, of, trade, missions, the, egyptians, referred, to, lower, nubia, as, wawat, irtjet, and, setju, while, they, referred, to, upper, nubia, as, yam, some, authors, believe, that, irtjet, and, setju, could, also, have, been, in, upper, nubia, 32, they, referred, to, nubians, dwelling, near, the, river, as, nehasyu, 26, from, aswan, the, southern, limit, of, egyptian, control, at, the, time, egyptians, imported, gold, incense, ebony, copper, ivory, and, exotic, animals, from, tropical, africa, through, nubia, relations, between, the, egyptians, and, nubians, showed, peaceful, cultural, interchange, cooperation, and, mixed, marriages, nubian, bowmen, that, settled, at, gebelein, during, the, first, intermediate, period, married, egyptian, women, were, buried, in, egyptian, style, and, eventually, could, not, be, distinguished, from, egyptians, 56, older, scholarship, noted, that, some, egyptian, pharaohs, may, have, had, nubian, ancestry, richard, loban, expressed, the, view, that, mentuhotep, ii, of, the, 11th, dynasty, was, quite, possibly, of, nubian, origin, and, cited, historical, evidence, which, mentioned, that, amenemhet, i, founder, of, the, 12th, dynasty, had, a, ta, seti, or, nubian, mother, dietrich, wildung, has, argued, that, nubian, features, were, common, in, egyptian, iconography, since, the, pre, dynastic, era, and, that, several, pharaohs, such, as, khufu, and, mentuhotep, ii, were, represented, with, these, nubian, features, frank, yurco, wrote, that, egyptian, rulers, of, nubian, ancestry, had, become, egyptians, culturally, as, pharaohs, they, exhibited, typical, egyptian, attitudes, and, adopted, typical, egyptian, policies, yurco, noted, that, some, middle, kingdom, rulers, particularly, some, pharaohs, of, the, twelfth, dynasty, had, strong, nubian, features, due, to, the, origin, of, the, dynasty, in, the, aswan, region, of, southern, egypt, he, also, identified, the, pharaoh, sequenre, tao, of, the, seventeenth, dynasty, as, having, nubian, features, many, scholars, in, recent, years, have, argued, that, the, mother, of, amenemhat, i, founder, of, the, twelfth, dynasty, was, of, nubian, origin, after, a, period, of, withdrawal, the, middle, kingdom, of, egypt, conquered, lower, nubia, from, 2000, to, 1700, bc, 8, 25, by, 1900, bc, king, sesostris, i, began, building, a, series, of, towns, below, the, second, cataract, with, heavy, fortresses, that, had, enclosures, and, drawbridges, 19, sesotris, iii, relentlessly, expanded, his, kingdom, into, nubia, from, 1866, to, 1863, bc, and, erected, massive, river, forts, including, buhen, semna, shalfak, and, toshka, at, uronarti, to, gain, more, control, over, the, trade, routes, in, lower, nubia, they, also, provided, direct, access, to, trade, with, upper, nubia, which, was, independent, and, increasingly, powerful, during, this, time, these, egyptian, garrisons, seemed, to, peacefully, coexist, with, the, local, nubian, people, though, they, did, not, interact, much, with, them, medjay, was, the, name, given, by, ancient, egypt, to, nomadic, desert, dwellers, from, east, of, the, nile, river, the, term, was, used, variously, to, describe, a, location, the, medjay, people, or, their, role, job, in, the, kingdom, they, became, part, of, the, egyptian, military, as, scouts, and, minor, workers, before, being, incorporated, into, the, egyptian, army, in, the, army, the, medjay, served, as, garrison, troops, in, egyptian, fortifications, in, nubia, and, patrolled, the, deserts, as, a, kind, of, gendarmerie, or, elite, paramilitary, police, force, to, prevent, their, fellow, medjay, tribespeople, from, further, attacking, egyptian, assets, in, the, region, the, medjay, were, often, used, to, protect, valuable, areas, especially, royal, and, religious, complexes, although, they, are, most, notable, for, their, protection, of, the, royal, palaces, and, tombs, in, thebes, and, the, surrounding, areas, the, medjay, were, deployed, throughout, upper, and, lower, egypt, they, were, even, used, during, kamose, s, campaign, against, the, hyksos, and, became, instrumental, in, turning, the, egyptian, state, into, a, military, power, after, the, first, intermediate, period, of, egypt, the, medjay, district, was, no, longer, mentioned, in, written, records, from, the, middle, kerma, phase, the, first, nubian, kingdom, to, unify, much, of, the, region, arose, the, classic, kerma, culture, named, for, its, royal, capital, at, kerma, was, one, of, the, earliest, urban, centers, in, the, nile, region, and, oldest, city, in, africa, outside, of, egypt, 50, 51, the, kerma, group, spoke, either, languages, of, the, cushitic, branch, or, according, to, more, recent, research, nilo, saharan, languages, of, the, eastern, sudanic, branch, by, 1650, bc, classic, kerma, phase, the, kings, of, kerma, were, powerful, enough, to, organize, the, labor, for, monumental, town, walls, and, large, mud, brick, structures, such, as, the, eastern, and, western, deffufas, 50, by, 25, by, 18, meters, they, also, had, rich, tombs, with, possessions, for, the, afterlife, and, large, human, sacrifices, george, andrew, reisner, excavated, sites, at, the, royal, city, of, kerma, and, found, distinctive, nubian, architecture, such, as, large, pebble, covered, tombs, 90, meters, in, diameter, a, large, circular, dwelling, and, a, palace, like, structure, 41, classic, kerma, rulers, employed, a, good, many, egyptians, according, to, the, egyptian, execration, texts, 57, kerma, culture, was, militaristic, as, attested, by, many, archers, burials, and, bronze, daggers, swords, found, in, their, graves, 31, other, signs, of, nubia, s, military, prowess, are, the, frequent, use, of, nubians, in, egypt, s, military, and, egypt, s, need, to, construct, numerous, fortresses, to, defend, their, southern, border, from, the, nubians, 31, despite, assimilation, the, nubian, elite, remained, rebellious, during, egyptian, occupation, there, were, numerous, rebellions, and, military, conflict, occurred, almost, under, every, reign, until, the, 20th, dynasty, 102, 103, at, one, point, kerma, came, very, close, to, conquering, egypt, egypt, suffered, a, serious, defeat, at, the, hands, of, the, kingdom, of, kush, according, to, davies, head, of, the, joint, british, museum, and, egyptian, archaeological, team, the, attack, was, so, devastating, that, if, the, kerma, forces, had, chosen, to, stay, and, occupy, egypt, they, might, have, permanently, eliminated, the, egyptians, and, brought, the, nation, to, extinction, during, egypt, s, second, intermediate, period, the, kushites, reached, the, height, of, their, bronze, age, power, and, completely, controlled, southern, trade, with, egypt, 41, they, maintained, diplomatic, ties, with, the, thebans, and, hyksos, until, the, new, kingdom, pharaohs, brought, all, of, nubia, under, egyptian, rule, from, 1500, to, 1070, bc, 41, after, 1070, bc, there, were, continued, hostilities, with, egypt, which, led, nubians, to, concentrate, in, upper, nubia, 58, within, 200, years, a, fully, formed, kushite, state, based, at, napata, began, to, exert, its, influence, on, upper, southern, egypt, 58, 59, when, the, middle, kingdom, egyptians, pulled, out, of, the, napata, region, around, 1700, bc, they, left, a, lasting, legacy, that, was, merged, with, indigenous, c, group, customs, egyptians, remaining, at, the, garrison, towns, started, to, merge, with, the, c, group, nubians, in, lower, nubia, the, c, group, quickly, adopted, egyptian, customs, and, culture, as, attested, by, their, graves, and, lived, together, with, the, remaining, egyptians, in, garrison, towns, 41, after, upper, nubia, annexed, lower, nubia, around, 1700, bc, the, kingdom, of, kush, began, to, control, the, area, at, this, point, c, group, nubians, and, egyptians, began, to, proclaim, their, allegiance, to, the, kushite, king, in, their, inscriptions, 41, egypt, conquered, lower, and, upper, nubia, from, 1500, to, 1070, bc, however, the, kingdom, of, kush, survived, longer, than,

of, thutmose, i, s, reign, 1520, bc, all, of, lower, nubia, had, been, annexed, after, a, long, campaign, egypt, also, conquered, the, kingdom, of, kerma, in, upper, nubia, and, held, both, areas, until, 1070, bc, 101, 102, 25, the, egyptian, empire, expanded, into, the, fourth, cataract, and, a, new, administrative, center, was, built, at, napata, which, became, a, gold, and, incense,

maps, known, is, of, a, gold, mine, in, nubia, the, turin, papyrus, map, dating, to, about, 1160, bc, it, is, also, one, of, the, earliest, characterized, road, maps, in, existence, nubians, were, an, integral, part, of, new, kingdom, egyptian, society, some, scholars, state, that, nubians, were, included, in, the, 18th, dynasty, of, egypt, s, royal, family, ahmose, nefertari, arguably, the, most, venerated, woman, in, egyptian, history, was, thought, by, some, scholars, such, as, flinders, petrie, to, be, of, nubian, origin, because, she, is, most, often, depicted, with, black, skin, 17, the, mummy, of, ahmose, nefertari, s, father, seqenenre, tao, has, been, described, as, presenting, tightly, curled, woolly, hair, with, a, slight, build, and, strongly, nubian, features, some, modern, scholars, also, believe, that, in, some, depictions, her, skin, color, is, indicative, of, her, role, as, a, goddess, of, resurrection, since, black, is, both, the, color, of, the, fertile, land, of, egypt, and, that, of, the, underworld, 90, 125, however, there, is, no, known, depiction, of, her, painted, during, her, lifetime, she, is, represented, with, the, same, light, skin, as, other, represented, individuals, in, tomb, tt15, before, her, deification, the, earliest, black, skin, depiction, appears, in, tomb, tt161, c, 150, years, after, her, death, 11, 12, 23, 74, 5, 125, egyptologist, barbara, lesko, wrote, in, 1996, that, ahmose, nefertari, was, sometimes, portrayed, by, later, generations, as, having, been, black, although, her, coffin, portrait, gives, her, the, typical, light, yellow, skin, of, women, in, 2009, egyptologist, elena, vassilika, noting, that, in, a, wooden, statuette, of, the, queen, now, at, the, museo, egizio, the, face, is, painted, black, but, the, arms, and, feet, are, light, in, color, argued, that, the, reason, for, the, black, coloring, in, that, case, was, religious, and, not, genetic, 78, 9, in, 1098, 1088, bc, thebes, was, the, scene, of, a, civil, war, like, conflict, between, the, high, priest, of, amun, of, thebes, amenhotep, and, the, viceroy, of, kush, panehesy, the, nubian, it, was, chaotic, and, many, tombs, were, plundered, instead, of, sending, soldiers, to, restore, order, ramesses, xi, put, panehesy, in, control, of, that, area, s, military, and, appointed, him, director, of, granaries, panehesy, stationed, his, troops, in, thebes, to, protect, the, city, from, thieves, but, it, resembled, a, military, occupation, of, thebes, to, the, high, priest, which, later, led, to, the, civil, war, in, thebes, 104, 105, by, 1082, bc, ramesses, xi, finally, sent, help, to, the, high, priest, panehesy, continued, his, revolt, and, the, city, of, thebes, suffered, from, war, famine, and, plunderings, 106, panehesy, initially, succeeded, and, the, high, priest, fled, thebes, panehesy, pursued, the, high, priest, as, far, as, middle, egypt, before, egyptian, forces, pushed, panehesy, and, his, troops, out, of, egypt, and, into, lower, nubia, 106, ramesses, sent, new, leadership, to, thebes, herihor, was, named, the, new, high, priest, of, thebes, and, effectively, king, of, southern, egypt, and, paiankh, was, named, the, new, viceroy, of, kush, paiankh, recaptured, former, egyptian, holdings, in, lower, nubia, as, far, as, the, second, nile, cataract, but, could, not, defeat, panehesy, in, lower, nubia, who, ruled, the, area, until, his, death, 106, herihor, s, descendants, became, rulers, of, egypt, s, 21st, and, 22nd, dynasties, there, are, competing, theories, on, the, origins, of, the, kushite, kings, of, the, 25th, dynasty, some, scholars, believe, they, were, nubian, officials, that, learned, state, level, organization, by, administering, egyptian, held, nubia, from, 1500, to, 1070, bc, 59, such, as, the, rebel, viceroy, of, kush, panehesy, who, ruled, upper, nubia, and, some, of, lower, nubia, after, egyptian, forces, withdrew, 110, other, scholars, believe, they, are, descended, from, families, of, the, egyptianized, nubian, elite, supported, by, egyptian, priests, or, settlers, children, of, elite, nubian, families, were, sent, to, be, educated, in, egypt, then, returned, to, kush, to, be, appointed, in, bureaucratic, positions, to, ensure, their, loyalty, during, the, egyptian, occupation, of, nubia, there, were, temple, towns, with, egyptian, cults, but, production, and, redistribution, was, based, mostly, on, indigenous, social, structures, 111, the, el, kurru, chiefdom, likely, played, a, major, role, in, the, development, of, the, kingdom, of, kush, due, to, its, access, to, gold, producing, areas, control, of, caravan, routes, 112, more, arable, land, and, participation, in, international, trade, 121, there, can, be, no, doubt, that, el, kurru, was, the, burial, place, of, the, ancestors, of, the, twenty, fifth, dynasty, 112, the, early, el, kurru, burials, resemble, nubian, kerma, c, group, traditions, contracted, body, circular, stone, structures, burial, on, a, bed, 121, however, by, 880, 815, bc, nubian, burials, at, el, kurru, became, more, egyptian, in, style, with, mastabas, or, pyramid, on, mastabas, chapels, and, rectangular, enclosures, 117, 121, 122, alara, the, first, el, kurru, prince, and, his, successor, kashta, were, buried, at, el, kurru, 123, later, documents, mention, alara, as, the, 25th, dynasty, s, founder, and, central, to, a, myth, of, the, origins, of, the, kingdom, 124, 126, alara, s, sister, was, the, priestess, of, amun, which, created, a, system, of, royal, secession, and, an, ideology, of, royal, power, in, which, kushite, concepts, and, practice, were, united, with, contemporary, egyptian, concepts, of, kingship, 144, later, kashta, s, daughter, the, kushite, princess, amenirdis, was, installed, as, god, s, wife, of, amun, elect, and, later, divine, adoratrice, effectively, governor, of, upper, egypt, which, signaled, the, kushite, conquest, of, egyptian, territories, 148, the, napatan, empire, ushered, in, the, age, of, egyptian, archaism, or, a, return, to, a, historical, past, which, was, embodied, by, a, concentrated, effort, at, religious, renewal, and, restoration, of, egypt, s, holy, places, 169, piye, expanded, the, temple, of, amun, at, jebel, barkal, by, adding, an, immense, colonnaded, forecourt, 163, 164, shabaka, restored, the,

egyptian, culture, by, 780, bc, amun, was, the, main, god, of, kush, and, intense, contacts, with, thebes, were, maintained, 144, kush, used, the, methods, of, egyptian, art, and, writing, the, nubian, elite, adopted, many, egyptian, customs, and, gave, their, children, egyptian, names, although, some, nubian, customs, and, beliefs, e, g, burial, practices, continued, to, be, practiced, 111, egyptianization, dominated, in, ideas, practices, and, iconography, the, cultural, egyptianization, of, nubia, was, at, its, highest, levels, at, the, times, of, both, kashta, and, piye, kashta, peacefully, became, king, of, upper, and, lower, egypt, with, his, daughter, amendiris, as, divine, adoratrice, of, amun, in, thebes, 144, 146, rulers, of, the, 23rd, dynasty, withdrew, from, thebes, to, heracleopolis, which, avoided, conflict, with, the, new, kushite, rulers, of, thebes, under, kashta, s, reign, the, kushite, elite, and, professional, classes, became, significantly, egyptianized,

double, kingship, after, generations, of, kushite, planning, resulted, from, kushite, ambition, political, skill, and, the, theban, decision, to, reunify, egypt, in, this, particular, way, and, not, egypt, s, utter, exhaustion, as, frequently, suggested, in, egyptological, studies, due, to, archaism, piye, mostly, used, the, royal, titulary, of, tuthmosis, iii, but, changed, the, horus, name, from, strong, bull, appearing, crowned, in, thebes, to, strong, bull, appearing, in, napata, to, announce, that, the, kushites, had, reversed, history, and, conquered, their, former, thebaid,

effectiveness, of, the, occupation, 67, dynastic, struggles, led, to, the, ptolemies, abandoning, the, area, so, the, kushites, reasserted, their, control, with, qasr, ibrim, occupied, by, the, kushites, and, other, locations, perhaps, garrisoned, 67, according, to, welsby, after, the, romans, assumed, control, of, egypt, they, negotiated, with, the, kushites, at, philae, and, drew, the, southern, border, of, roman, egypt, at, aswan, 67, theodore, mommsen, and, welsby, state, the, kingdom, of, kush, became, a, client, kingdom, which, was, similar, to, the, situation, under, ptolemaic, rule, of, egypt, kushite, ambition, and, excessive, roman, taxation, are, two, theories, for, a, revolt, supported, by, kushite, armies, 67, 68, the, ancient, historians, strabo, and, pliny, give, accounts, of, the, conflict, with, roman, egypt, strabo, describes, a, war, with, the, romans, in, first, century, bc, he, stated, that, the, kushites, sacked, aswan, with, an, army, of, 30, 000, men, and, destroyed, imperial, statues, at, philae, 68, a, fine, over, life, size, bronze, head, of, the, emperor, augustus, was, found, buried, in, meroe, in, front, of, a, temple, 68, after, the, initial, victories, of, kandake, or, candace, amanirenas, against, roman, egypt, the, kushites, were, defeated, and, napata, was, sacked, napata, s, fall, was, not, a, crippling, blow, to, the, kushites, and, did, not, frighten, candace, enough, to, prevent, her, from, again, engaging, in, combat, with, the, roman, military, in, 22, bc, a, large, kushite, force, moved, northward, with, the, intention, of, attacking, qasr, ibrim, alerted, to, the, advance, petronius, again, marched, south, and, managed, to, reach, qasr, ibrim, and, bolster, its, defences, before, the, invading, kushites, arrived, welsby, states, after, a, kushite, attack, on, primis, qasr, ibrim, 69, 70, the, kushites, sent, ambassadors, to, negotiate, a, peace, settlement, with, petronius, which, succeeded, on, favourable, terms, trade, between, the, two, nations, increased, and, the, roman, egyptian, border, being, extended, to, hiera, sykaminos, maharraqa, 149, 70, this, arrangement, guaranteed, peace, for, most, of, the, next, 300, years, and, there, is, no, definite, evidence, of, further, clashes, 70, during, this, time, different, parts, of, the, region, divided, into, smaller, groups, with, individual, leaders, or, generals, each, commanding, small, armies, of, mercenaries, they, fought, for, control, of, what, is, now, nubia, and, its, surrounding, territories, leaving, the, entire, region, weak, and, vulnerable, to, attack, mero, would, eventually, be, defeated, by, the, new, rising, kingdom, of, aksum, to, their, south, ruled, by, king, ezana, a, stele, of, ge, ez, of, an, unnamed, ruler, of, aksum, thought, to, be, ezana, was, found, at, the, site, of, mero, from, his, description, in, greek, he, was, king, of, the, aksumites, and, the, omerites, i, e, of, aksum, and, himyar, it, is, likely, this, king, ruled, sometime, around, 330, ad, while, some, authorities, interpret, these, inscriptions, as, proof, that, the, axumites, destroyed, the, kingdom, of, meroe, others, note, that, archeological, evidence, points, to, an, economic, and, political, decline, in, meroe, around, 300, moreover, some, view, the, stele, as, military, aid, from, aksum, to, meroe, to, quell, the, revolt, and, rebellion, from, then, on, the, romans, referred, to, the, area, as, nobatia, around, 350, ad, the, area, was, invaded, by, the, kingdom, of, aksum, and, the, meroitic, kingdom, collapsed, three, smaller, christian, kingdoms, replaced, it, the, northernmost, was, nobatia, capital, pachoras, now, modern, day, faras, egypt, between, the, first, and, second, cataract, of, the, nile, river, in, the, middle, was, makuria, capital, old, dongola, and, southernmost, was, alodia, capital, soba, king, silky, of, nobatia, defeated, the, blemmyes, and, recorded, his, victory, in, a, greek, language, inscription, carved, in, the, wall, of, the, temple, of, talmis, modern, kalabsha, around, 500, ad, christianity, had, been, introduced, to, the, region, by, the, fourth, century, bishop, athanasius, of, alexandria, consecrated, marcus, as, bishop, of, philae, before, his, death, in, 373, ad, john, of, ephesus, records, that, a, miaphysite, priest, named, julian, converted, the, king, and, his, nobles, of, nobatia, around, 545, ad, he, also, writes, that, the, kingdom, of, alodia, was, converted, around, 569, however, john, of, biclarum, wrote, that, the, kingdom, of, makuria, converted, to, catholicism, the, same, year, suggesting, that, john, of, ephesus, might, be, mistaken, further, doubt, is, cast, on, john, s, testimony, by, an, entry, in, the, chronicle, of, the, greek, orthodox, patriarch, of, alexandria, eutychius, of, alexandria, which, states, that, in, 719, ad, the, church, of, nubia, transferred, its, allegiance, from, the, greek, to, the, coptic, orthodox, church, after, the, official, christianization, of, nubia, the, isis, cult, of, philae, remained, for, the, sake, of, the, nubians, the, edict, of, theodosius, i, 390, ad, was, not, enforced, at, philae, later, attempts, to, suppress, the, cult, of, isis, led, to, armed, clashes, between, the, nubians, and, romans, finally, in, 453, ad, a, treaty, recognizing, the, traditional, religious, rights, of, nubians, at, philae, was, signed, by, the, seventh, century, makuria, expanded, and, became, the, dominant, power, in, the, region, it, was, strong, enough, to, halt, the, southern, expansion, of, islam, after, the, arabs, had, taken, egypt, after, several, failed, invasions, the, new, muslim, rulers, agreed, to, a, treaty, with, dongola, called, baqt, to, allow, peaceful, coexistence, and, trade, contingent, on, the, nubians, making, an, annual, payment, consisting, of, slaves, and, other, tributes, to, the, islamic, governor, at, aswan, it, guaranteed, that, any, runaway, slaves, were, returned, to, nubia, the, treaty, was, kept, for, six, hundred, years, throughout, this, period, nubia, s, main, exports, were, dates, and, slaves, though, ivory, and, gold, were, also, exchanged, for, egyptian, ceramics, textiles, and, glass, over, time, the, influx, of, arab, traders, introduced, islam, to, nubia, and, it, gradually, supplanted, christianity, after, an, interruption, in, the, annual, tribute, of, slaves, the, egyptian, mamluk, ruler, invaded, in, 1272, and, declared, himself, sovereign, over, half, of, nubia, while, there, are, records, of, a, bishop, timothy, at, qasr, ibrim, in, 1372, his, see, included, faras, it, is, also, clear, that, the, cathedral, of, dongola, had, been, converted, to, a, mosque, in, 1317, the, influx, of, arabs, and, nubians, to, egypt, and, sudan, had, contributed, to, the, suppression, of, the, nubian, identity, following, the, collapse, of, the, last, nubian, kingdom, around, 1504, a, vast, majority, of, the, nubian, population, is, currently, muslim, and, the, arabic, language, is, their, main, medium, of, communication, in, addition, to, their, indigenous, nubian, language, the, unique, characteristic, of, nubian, is, shown, in, their, culture, dress, dances, traditions, and, music, in, the, fourteenth, century, the, dongolan, government, collapsed, and, the, region, was, divided, and, dominated, by, arabs, several, arab, invasions, into, the, region, and, the, establishment, of, smaller, kingdoms, occurred, over, the, next, few, centuries, northern, nubia, was, brought, under, egyptian, control, while, the, south, was, controlled, by, the, kingdom, of, sennar, in, the, sixteenth, century, the, entire, region, came, under, egyptian, control, during, muhammad, ali, s, rule, in, the, early, nineteenth, century, and, later, became, a, joint, anglo, egyptian, condominium, in, 2003, archaeologist, charles, bonnet, led, a, team, of, swiss, archaeologists, to, excavate, near, kerma, and, discovered, a, cache, of, monumental, black, granite, statues, of, the, pharaohs, of, the, 25th, dynasty, of, egypt, now, displayed, at, the, kerma, museum, among, the, sculptures, are, ones, belonging, to, the, dynasty, s, last, two, pharaohs, taharqa, and, tanoutamon, whose, statues, are, described, as, masterpieces, that, rank, among, the, greatest, in, art, history, craniometric, analysis, of, kerma, fossils, that, compared, them, to, various, other, early, populations, inhabiting, the, nile, valley, and, maghreb, found, that, they, were, morphologically, close, to, predynastic, egyptians, from, naqada, 4000, 3200, bc, dental, trait, analysis, of, kerma, fossils, found, affinities, with, various, populations, inhabiting, the, nile, valley, horn, of, africa, and, northeast, africa, especially, to, other, ancient, populations, from, the, central, and, northern, sudan, among, the, sampled, populations, the, kerma, people, were, overall, nearest, to, the, kush, populations, in, upper, nubia, the, a, group, culture, bearers, of, lower, nubia, and, ethiopians, nubia, was, divided, between, egypt, and, sudan, after, colonialism, ended, and, the, republic, of, egypt, was, established, in, 1953, and, the, republic, of, sudan, seceded, from, egypt, in, 1956, in, the, early, 1970s, many, egyptian, and, sudanese, nubians, were, forcibly, relocated, to, make, room, for, lake, nasser, after, dams, were, constructed, at, aswan, nubian, villages, can, be, found, north, of, aswan, on, the, west, bank, of, the, nile, and, on, elephantine, island, many, nubians, now, live, in, large, cities, like, cairo, and, khartoum, in, 2014, a, male, infant, skeleton, was, recovered, during, an, excavation, in, what, is, present, day, wadi, halfa, from, the, christian, period, 500, 1400, c, e, located, near, the, second, cataract, of, the, nile, in, the, republic, of, the, sudan, the, results, from, the, principal, component, analysis, pca, had, the, individual, placed, between, african, and, european, clusters, furthermore, the, individual, was, assigned, to, l5a1a, a, branch, of, the, ancient, l5, haplogroup, with, origins, in, east, africa, sirak, et, al, 2021, obtained, and, analyzed, the, whole, genomes, of, 66, individuals, from, the, site, of, kulubnarti, situated, in, northern, nubia, between, the, 2nd, and, 3rd, cataract, near, the, modern, egyptian, border, and, dated, to, the, christian, period, between, 650, and, 1000, ce, the, samples, were, obtained, from, two, cemeteries, the, samples, genetic, profile, was, found, to, be, a, mixture, between, west, eurasian, and, sub, saharan, dinka, related, ancestries, with, 60, west, eurasian, related, ancestry, that, likely, came, from, ancient, egyptians, but, ultimately, resembles, that, found, in, bronze, or, iron, age, levantines, and, 40, dinka, related, ancestry, the, two, cemeteries, showed, minimal, differences, in, their, west, eurasian, dinka, ancestry, proportions, these, findings, in, addition, to, multiple, cross, cemetery, relatives, that, the, analyses, have, revealed, indicate, that, people, of, both, the, r, and, s, cemeteries, were, part, of, the, same, population, despite, the, archaeological, and, anthropological, differences, between, the, two, burials, showing, social, stratification, modern, nubians, despite, their, superficial, resemblance, to, the, kulubnarti, nubians, on, the, pca, were, not, found, to, be, descended, from, kulubnarti, nubians, without, additional, later, admixtures, modern, nubians, were, found, to, have, an, increase, in, sub, saharan, ancestry, along, with, a, change, in, their, west, eurasian, ancestry, from, that, which, was, found, in, the, ancient, samples, a, sample, from, historic, lower, nubia, in, the, nubian, site, of, sayala, during, the, 3rd, 6th, century, ad, belonged, to, mtdna, haplogroup, j1c, in, 2022, dna, was, sequenced, from, the, hair, of, a, kerma, period, individual, 4000, bp, and, the, results, revealed, close, genetic, affinity, to, early, pastoralists, from, the, rift, valley, in, eastern, africa, during, the, pastoral,
