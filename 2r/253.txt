confederacy, led, by, ajmer, ruler, prithviraj, chauhan, in, 1192, near, tarain, after, suffering, a, reverse, against, them, earlier, as, a, successor, to, the, ghurid, dynasty, the, delhi, sultanate, was, originally, one, among, several, principalities, ruled, by, the, turkic, slave, generals, of, muhammad, ghori, including, taj, al, din, yildiz, qutb, ud, din, aibak, bahauddin, tughril, and, nasir, ad, din, qabacha, that, had, inherited, and, divided, the, ghurid, territories, amongst, themselves, khalji, and, tughlaq, rule, ushered, a, new, wave, of, rapid, and, ceaseless, muslim, conquests, deep, into, south, india, the, sultanate, finally, reached, the, peak, of, its, geographical, reach, during, the, tughlaq, dynasty, occupying, most, of, the, indian, subcontinent, under, muhammad, bin, tughluq, a, major, political, transformation, occurred, across, north, india, triggered, by, the, central, asian, king, timur, s, devastating, raid, on, delhi, in, 1398, followed, soon, afterwards, by, the, re, emergence, of, rival, hindu, powers, such, as, vijayanagara, and, mewar, asserting, independence, and, new, muslim, sultanates, such, as, the, bengal, and, bahmani, sultanates, breaking, off, in, 1526, timurid, ruler, babur, invaded, northern, india, and, conquered, the, sultanate, leading, to, its, succession, by, the, mughal, empire, the, establishment, of, the, sultanate, drew, the, indian, subcontinent, more, closely, into, international, and, multicultural, islamic, social, and, economic, networks, as, seen, concretely, in, the, development, of, the, hindustani, language, and, indo, islamic, architecture, it, was, also, one, of, the, few, powers, to, repel, attacks, by, the, mongols, from, the, chagatai, khanate, and, saw, the, enthronement, of, one, of, the, few, female, rulers, in, islamic, history, razia, sultana, who, reigned, from, 1236, to, 1240, their, treatment, of, hindus, buddhists, and, other, dharmic, faiths, are, generally, perceived, to, be, unfavorable, as, mass, forcible, conversions, were, popular, during, the, sultanate, s, rule, and, large, scale, desecrations, of, hindu, and, buddhist, temples, including, universities, and, libraries, took, place, mongolian, raids, on, west, and, central, asia, set, the, scene, for, centuries, of, migration, of, fleeing, soldiers, intelligentsia, mystics, traders, artists, and, artisans, from, those, regions, into, the, subcontinent, thereby, establishing, islamic, culture, there, although, conventionally, named, after, its, principal, capital, city, delhi, the, terminology, applied, to, domains, under, delhi, sultanate, was, often, unspecified, it, was, called, as, empire, of, delhi, persian, mamalik, i, delhi, by, juzjani, and, barani, while, ibn, battuta, called, the, empire, under, muhammad, bin, tughlaq, as, hind, and, sind, the, delhi, sultanate, was, also, known, as, the, empire, of, hindustan, persian, mamalik, i, hindustan, a, name, that, gained, currency, during, the, period, the, rise, of, the, delhi, sultanate, in, india, was, part, of, a, wider, trend, affecting, much, of, the, asian, continent, including, the, whole, of, southern, and, western, asia, the, influx, of, nomadic, turkic, peoples, from, the, central, asian, steppes, this, can, be, traced, back, to, the, 9th, century, when, the, islamic, caliphate, began, fragmenting, in, the, middle, east, where, muslim, rulers, in, rival, states, began, enslaving, non, muslim, nomadic, turks, from, the, central, asian, steppes, and, raising, many, of, them, to, become, loyal, army, slaves, called, mamluks, soon, turks, were, migrating, to, muslim, lands, and, becoming, islamicized, many, of, the, turkic, mamluk, slaves, eventually, rose, to, become, rulers, and, conquered, large, parts, of, the, muslim, world, establishing, mamluk, sultanates, from, egypt, to, present, day, afghanistan, before, turning, their, attention, to, the, indian, subcontinent, it, is, also, part, of, a, longer, trend, predating, the, spread, of, islam, like, other, settled, agrarian, societies, in, history, those, in, the, indian, subcontinent, have, been, attacked, by, nomadic, tribes, throughout, its, long, history, in, evaluating, the, impact, of, islam, on, the, subcontinent, one, must, note, that, the, northwestern, subcontinent, was, a, frequent, target, of, tribes, raiding, from, central, asia, in, the, pre, islamic, era, in, that, sense, the, muslim, intrusions, and, later, muslim, invasions, were, not, dissimilar, to, those, of, the, earlier, invasions, during, the, 1st, millennium, by, 962, ad, hindu, and, buddhist, kingdoms, in, south, asia, faced, a, series, of, raids, from, muslim, armies, from, central, asia, among, them, was, mahmud, of, ghazni, the, son, of, a, turkic, mamluk, military, slave, who, raided, and, plundered, kingdoms, in, northern, india, from, east, of, the, indus, river, to, west, of, the, yamuna, river, seventeen, times, between, 997, and, 1030, mahmud, of, ghazni, raided, the, treasuries, but, retreated, each, time, only, extending, islamic, rule, into, western, punjab, the, series, of, raids, on, northern, and, western, indian, kingdoms, by, muslim, warlords, continued, after, mahmud, of, ghazni, the, raids, did, not, establish, or, extend, the, permanent, boundaries, of, the,

indus, river, and, he, thus, laid, the, foundation, for, the, muslim, kingdom, called, the, delhi, sultanate, some, historians, chronicle, the, delhi, sultanate, from, 1192, due, to, the, presence, and, geographical, claims, of, muhammad, ghori, in, south, asia, by, that, time, ghori, was, assassinated, in, 1206, by, ism, l, shia, muslims, after, the, assassination, one, of, ghori, s, slaves,

bin, tughlaq, and, ruled, for, 26, years, during, his, rule, the, delhi, sultanate, reached, its, peak, in, terms, of, geographical, reach, covering, most, of, the, indian, subcontinent, muhammad, bin, tughlaq, was, an, intellectual, with, extensive, knowledge, of, the, quran, fiqh, poetry, and, other, fields, he, was, also, deeply, suspicious, of, his, kinsmen, and, wazirs, ministers, extremely, severe, with, his, opponents, and, took, decisions, that, caused, economic, upheaval, for, example, he, ordered, the, minting, of, coins, from, base, metals, with, face, value, of, silver, coins, a, decision, that, failed, because, ordinary, people, minted, counterfeit, coins, from, base, metal, they, had, in, their, houses, and, used, them, to, pay, taxes, and, jizya, muhammad, bin, tughlaq, chose, the, city, of, deogiri, in, the, present, day, indian, state, of, maharashtra, renaming, it, daulatabad, as, the, second, administrative, capital, of, the, delhi, sultanate, he, ordered, a, forced, migration, of, the, muslim, population, of, delhi, including, his, royal, family, the, nobles, syeds, sheikhs, and, ulema, to, settle, in, daulatabad, the, purpose, of,

who, were, unwilling, to, move, to, daulatabad, seeing, their, non, compliance, with, his, order, as, equivalent, to, rebellion, according, to, ferishta, when, the, mongols, arrived, into, punjab, the, sultan, returned, the, elite, to, delhi, although, daulatabad, remained, an, administrative, centre, one, result, of, the, transfer, of, the, elite, to, daulatabad, was, the, hatred, of, the, nobility, to, the, sultan, which, remained, in, their, minds, for, a, long, time, the, other, result, was, that, he, managed, to, create, a, stable, muslim, elite, and, result, in, the, growth, of, the, muslim, population, of, daulatabad, who, did, not, return, to, delhi, without, which, the, rise, of, the, bahmanid, kingdom, to, challenge, the, vijayanagara, kingdom, would, not, have, been,

the, 1330s, muhammad, bin, tughlaq, ordered, an, invasion, of, china, sending, part, of, his, forces, over, the, himalayas, however, they, were, defeated, by, the, kangra, state, during, his, reign, state, revenues, collapsed, from, his, policies, such, as, the, base, metal, coins, from, 1329, to, 1332, famines, widespread, poverty, and, rebellion, grew, across, the, kingdom, in, 1338, his, nephew, rebelled, in, malwa, whom, he, attacked, caught, flayed, alive, killed, ultimately, by, 1339, the, eastern, regions, under, local, muslim, governors, and, southern, parts, led, by, hindu, kings, had, revolted, and, declared, independence, from, the, delhi, sultanate, muhammad, bin, tughlaq, did, not, have, the, resources, or, support, to, respond, to, the, shrinking, kingdom, the, historian, walford, chronicled, that, delhi, and, most, of, india, faced, severe, famines, during, muhammad, bin, tughlaq, s, rule, in, the, years, after, the, base, metal, coin, experiment, in, 1335,

to, schimmel, the, previously, dominant, sunni, sect, of, islam, became, diluted, alternate, muslim, sects, such, as, shia, rose, and, new, competing, centres, of, islamic, culture, took, roots, beyond, delhi, in, the, course, of, the, late, sayyid, dynasty, the, delhi, sultanate, shrank, until, it, became, a, minor, power, by, the, time, of, the, last, sayyid, ruler, alam, shah, whose, name, translated, to, king, of, the, world, this, resulted, in, a, common, northern, indian, witticism, according, to, which, the, kingdom, of, the, king, of, the, world, extends, from, delhi, to, palam, i,

the, lodi, dynasty, in, 1451, however, resulting, in, a, resurgence, of, the, delhi, sultanate, the, lodi, dynasty, was, an, afghan, or, turco, afghan, dynasty, related, to, the, pashtun, afghan, lodi, tribe, the, founder, of, the, dynasty, bahlul, khan, lodi, was, a, khalji, of, the, lodi, clan, he, started, his, reign, by, attacking, the, muslim, jaunpur, sultanate, to, expand, the, influence, of, the, delhi, sultanate, and, was, partially, successful, through, a, treaty, thereafter, the, region, from, delhi, to, varanasi, then, at, the, border, of, bengal, province, was, back, under, the, influence, of, the, delhi, sultanate, after, bahlul, lodi, died, his, son, nizam, khan, assumed, power, renamed, himself, sikandar, lodi, and, ruled, from, 1489, to, 1517, one, of, the, better, known, rulers, of, the, dynasty, sikandar, lodi, expelled, his, brother, barbak, shah, from, jaunpur, installed, his, son, jalal, khan, as, the, ruler, then, proceeded, east, to, make, claims, on, bihar, the, muslim, governors, of, bihar, agreed, to, pay, tribute, and, taxes, but, operated, independently, of, the, delhi, sultanate, sikandar, lodi, led, a, campaign, of, destruction, of, temples, particularly, around, mathura, he, also, moved, his, capital, and, court, from, delhi, to, agra, an, ancient, hindu, city, that, had, been, destroyed, during, the, plunder, and, attacks, of, the, early, delhi, sultanate, period, sikandar, thus, erected, buildings, with, indo, islamic, architecture, in, agra, during, his, rule, and, the, growth, of, agra, continued, during, the, mughal,

the, support, of, the, amirs, and, chiefs, ibrahim, lodi, was, unable, to, consolidate, his, power, and, after, jalal, khan, s, death, the, governor, of, punjab, daulat, khan, lodi, reached, out, to, the, mughal, babur, and, invited, him, to, attack, the, delhi, sultanate, babur, defeated, and, killed, ibrahim, lodi, in, the, battle, of, panipat, in, 1526, the, death, of, ibrahim, lodi, ended, the, delhi, sultanate, and, the, mughal, empire, replaced, it, the, historian, peter, jackson, explains, in, the, new, cambridge, history, of, islam, the, elite, of, the, early, delhi, sultanate, comprised, overwhelmingly, first, generation, immigrants, from, iran, and, central, asia, persians, turks, gh, r, s, khalaj, from, the, hot, regions, garms, r, of, modern, afghanistan, medieval, scholars, such, as, isami, and, barani, suggested, that, the, prehistory, of, the, delhi, sultanate, lay, in, the, ghaznavid, state, and, that, its, ruler, mahmud, ghaznavi, provided, the, foundation, and, inspiration, integral, in, the, making, of, the, delhi, regime, the, mongol, and, hindus, monarchies, were, the, great, others, in, these, narratives, and, the, persianate, and, class, conscious, aristocratic, virtues, of, the, ideal, state, were, creatively, memorialized, in, the, ghaznavid, state, now, the, templates, for, the, delhi, sultanate, cast, within, a, historical, narrative, it, allowed, for, a, more, self, reflective, linear, rooting, of, the, sultanate, in, the, great, traditions, of, muslim, statecraft, over, time, successive, muslim, dynasties, created, a, centralized, structure, in, the, persian, tradition, whose, task, was, to, mobilize, human, and, material, resources, for, the, ongoing, armed, struggle, against, both, mongol, and, hindu, monarchies, the, monarch, was, not, the, sultan, of, the, hindus, or, of, say, the, people, of, haryana, rather, in, the, eyes, of, the, sultanate, s, chroniclers, the, muslims, constituted, what, in, more, recent, times, would, be, termed, a, staatsvolk, for, many, muslim, observers, the, ultimate, justification, for, any, ruler, within, the, islamic, world, was, the, protection, and, advancement, of, the, faith, for, the, sultans, as, for, their, ghaznavid, and, ghurid, predecessors, this, entailed, the, suppression, of, heterodox, muslims, and, firuz, shah, attached, some, importance, to, the, fact, that, he, had, acted, against, the, ashab, i, had, u, ibadat, deviators, and, latitudinarians, it, also, involved, plundering, and, extorting, tribute, from, independent, hindu, principalities, firuz, shah, who, believed, that, india, was, changed, into, a, muslim, nation, declared, that, no, zimmi, living, in, a, musalman, country, might, dare, to, act, the, hindu, kingdoms, who, submitted, to, islamic, rule, qualified, as, protected, peoples, according, to, the, wide, spectrum, of, the, educated, muslim, community, within, the, subcontinent, the, balance, of, the, evidence, is, that, in, the, latter, half, of, the, fourteenth, century, if, not, before, the, jizyah, was, levied, as, a, discriminatory, tax, on, non, muslims, although, even, then, it, is, difficult, to, see, how, such, a, measure, could, have, been, enforced, outside, the, principal, centres, of, muslim, authority, the, delhi, sultanate, also, continued, the, governmental, conventions, of, the, previous, hindu, polities, claiming, paramountcy, of, some, of, its, subjects, rather, than, exclusive, supreme, control, accordingly, it, did, not, interfere, with, the, autonomy, and, military, of, certain, conquered, hindu, rulers, and, freely, included, hindu, vassals, and, officials, the, economic, policy, of, the, delhi, sultanate, was, characterized, by, greater, government, involvement, in, the, economy, relative, to, the, classical, hindu, dynasties, and, increased, penalties, for, private, businesses, that, broke, government, regulations, alauddin, khalji, replaced, the, private, markets, with, four, centralized, government, run, markets, appointed, a, market, controller, and, implemented, strict, price, controls, on, all, kinds, of, goods, from, caps, to, socks, from, combs, to, pins, from, vegetables, to, soups, from, sweetmeats, to, chapatis, according, to, ziauddin, barani, the, price, controls, were, inflexible, even, during, droughts, capitalist, investors, were, completely, banned, from, participating, in, the, horse, trade, animal, and, slave, brokers, were, forbidden, from, collecting, commissions, and, private, merchants, were, eliminated, from, all, animal, and, slave, markets, bans, were, instituted, against, hoarding, and, regrating, granaries, were, nationalized, and, limits, were, placed, on, the, amount, of, grain, that, could, be, used, by, cultivators, for, personal, use, various, licensing, rules, were, imposed, registration, of, merchants, was, required, and, expensive, goods, such, as, certain, fabrics, were, deemed, unnecessary, for, the, general, public, and, required, a, permit, from, the, state, to, be, purchased, these, licenses, were, issued, to, amirs, maliks, and, other, important, persons, in, government, agricultural, taxes, were, raised, to, 50, traders, regarded, the, regulations, as, burdensome, and, violations, were, severely, punished, leading, to, further, resentment, among, the, traders, a, network, of, spies, was, instituted, to, ensure, the, implementation, of, the, system, even, after, price, controls, were, lifted, after, khalji, s, death, barani, claims, that, the, fear, of, his, spies, remained, and, that, people, continued, to, avoid, trading, in, expensive, commodities, the, sultanate, enforced, islamic, religious, prohibitions, on, anthropomorphic, representations, in, art, the, army, of, the, delhi, sultans, initially, consisted, of, nomadic, turkic, mamluk, military, slaves, belonging, to, muhammad, of, ghor, the, nucleus, of, this, southeast, asian, sultanate, military, were, the, turco, afghani, regular, units, named, wajih, which, were, composed, of, elite, household, cavalry, archers, who, came, from, slave, backgrounds, a, major, military, contribution, of, the, delhi, sultanate, was, their, successful, campaigns, repelling, the, mongol, empire, s, invasions, of, india, which, could, have, been, devastating, for, the, indian, subcontinent, like, the, mongol, invasions, of, china, persia, and, europe, were, it, not, for, the, delhi, sultanate, the, mongol, empire, may, have, been, successful, in, invading, india, the, strength, of, the, armies, changes, according, to, time, historians, states, the, delhi, sultanate, during, khalji, dynasty, maintain, of, 300, 000, 400, 000, horse, cavalry, and, 2500, 3000, war, elephant, as, standing, army, its, successor, state, the, tughlaq, dynasty, further, expanded, into, 500, 000, horse, cavalry, in, their, force, some, historians, argue, that, the, delhi, sultanate, was, responsible, for, making, india, more, multicultural, and, cosmopolitan, the, establishment, of, the, delhi, sultanate, in, india, has, been, compared, to, the, expansion, of, the, mongol, empire, and, called, part, of, a, larger, trend, occurring, throughout, much, of, eurasia, in, which, nomadic, people, migrated, from, the, steppes, of, inner, asia, and, became, politically, dominant, according, to, angus, maddison, between, the, years, 1000, and, 1500, india, s, gdp, of, which, the, sultanates, represented, a, significant, part, grew, nearly, 8, to, 60, 5, billion, in, 1500, though, the, overall, the, percentage, of, the, gdp, share, reduced, from, 33, to, 22, according, to, maddison, s, estimates, india, s, population, grew, from, 85million, in, 1200, to, 101, million, in, 1500, ad, in, the, period, the, delhi, sultanate, period, coincided, with, more, use, of, mechanical, technology, in, the, indian, subcontinent, india, previously, already, had, highly, sophisticated, agriculture, food, crops, textiles, medicine, minerals, and, metals, water, wheels, also, previously, existed, in, india, as, described, by, various, chinese, monks, and, arab, travellers, and, writers, in, their, books, during, the, delhi, sultanate, various, mechanical, devices, were, introduced, from, the, islamic, world, to, india, such, as, geared, water, raising, wheels, and, other, machines, with, gears, pulleys, cams, and, cranks, later, mughal, emperor, babur, provided, a, description, on, the, use, of, water, wheels, in, the, delhi, sultanate, according, to, historians, arnold, pacey, and, irfan, habib, the, spinning, wheel, was, introduced, to, india, from, iran, during, the, delhi, sultanate, smith, and, cothren, suggested, that, it, was, invented, in, india, during, the, latter, half, of, the, first, millennium, but, pacey, and, habib, said, these, early, references, to, cotton, spinning, do, not, identify, a, wheel, but, more, likely, refer, to, hand, spinning, the, earliest, unambiguous, reference, to, a, spinning, wheel, in, india, is, dated, to, 1350, the, worm, gear, roller, cotton, gin, was, invented, in, the, thirteenth, or, fourteenth, centuries, habib, states, that, the, development, may, likely, occurred, in, peninsular, india, before, becoming, more, widespread, across, india, during, the, mughal, era, the, incorporation, of, the, crank, handle, in, the, cotton, gin, may, have, appeared, sometime, during, the, late, delhi, sultanate, or, the, early, mughal, empire, india, and, china, have, connections, throughout, the, thousands, of, years, of, history, paper, had, already, reached, some, parts, of, india, as, early, as, the, 6th, or, 7th, century, initially, through, chinese, travellers, and, the, ancient, silk, road, which, india, was, very, well, connected, with, earlier, some, historians, believed, that, paper, failed, to, catch, on, as, palmyra, leaves, and, birch, bark, remained, far, more, popular, but, this, theory, was, discredited, later, on, on, the, other, hand, paper, may, have, arrived, in, bengal, from, a, separate, route, as, 15th, century, chinese, traveler, ma, huan, remarked, that, bengali, paper, was, white, and, made, from, bark, of, a, tree, similar, to, the, chinese, method, of, papermaking, as, opposed, to, the, middle, eastern, method, of, using, rags, and, waste, material, suggesting, a, direct, route, from, china, for, the, arrival, of, paper, in, bengal, and, paper, was, already, very, well, established, and, widespread, in, that, part, of, the, subcontinent, according, to, one, set, of, very, uncertain, estimates, by, modern, historians, the, total, indian, population, had, largely, been, stagnant, at, 75, million, during, the, middle, kingdoms, era, from, 1, ad, to, 1000, ad, during, the, medieval, delhi, sultanate, era, from, 1000, to, 1500, india, as, a, whole, experienced, lasting, population, growth, for, the, first, time, in, a, thousand, years, with, its, population, increasing, nearly, 50, to, 110, million, by, 1500, ad, while, the, indian, subcontinent, has, had, invaders, from, central, asia, since, ancient, times, what, made, the, muslim, invasions, different, is, that, unlike, the, preceding, invaders, who, assimilated, into, the, prevalent, social, system, the, successful, muslim, conquerors, retained, their, islamic, identity, and, created, new, legal, and, administrative, systems, that, challenged, and, usually, in, many, cases, superseded, the, existing, systems, of, social, conduct, and, ethics, even, influencing, the, non, muslim, rivals, and, common, masses, to, a, large, extent, though, the, non, muslim, population, was, left, to, their, own, laws, and, customs, they, also, introduced, new, cultural, codes, that, in, some, ways, were, very, different, from, the, existing, cultural, codes, this, led, to, the, rise, of, a, new, indian, culture, that, was, mixed, in, nature, different, from, ancient, indian, culture, the, overwhelming, majority, of, muslims, in, india, were, indian, natives, converted, to, islam, this, factor, also, played, an, important, role, in, the, synthesis, of, cultures, the, hindustani, language, hindi, urdu, began, to, emerge, in, the, delhi, sultanate, period, developed, from, the, middle, indo, aryan, apabhramsha, vernaculars, of, north, india, amir, khusro, who, lived, in, the, 13th, century, ce, during, the, delhi, sultanate, period, in, north, india, used, a, form, of, hindustani, which, was, the, lingua, franca, of, the, period, in, his, writings, and, referred, to, it, as, hindavi, the, officers, the, sultans, khans, maliks, and, the, soldiers, wore, the, islamic, qabas, dress, in, the, style, of, khwarezm, which, were, tucked, in, the, middle, of, the, body, while, the, turban, and, kullah, were, common, headwear, the, turbans, were, wrapped, around, the, kullah, caps, and, the, feet, were, covered, with, red, boots, the, wazirs, and, katibs, also, dressed, like, the, soldiers, except, they, did, not, use, belts, and, often, let, down, a, piece, of, cloth, in, front, of, them, in, the, manner, of, the, sufis, the, judges, and, the, learned, men, wore, ample, gowns, farajiyat, and, an, arabic, garment, durra, the, start, of, the, delhi, sultanate, in, 1206, under, qutb, al, din, aibak, introduced, a, large, islamic, state, to, india, using, central, asian, styles, the, types, and, forms, of, large, buildings, required, by, muslim, elites, with, mosques, and, tombs, much, the, most, common, were, very, different, from, those, previously, built, in, india, the, exteriors, of, both, were, very, often, topped, by, large, domes, and, made, extensive, use, of, arches, both, of, these, features, were, hardly, used, in, hindu, temple, architecture, and, other, indigenous, indian, styles, both, types, of, building, essentially, consist, of, a, single, large, space, under, a, high, dome, and, completely, avoid, the, figurative, sculpture, so, important, to, hindu, temple, architecture, the, important, qutb, complex, in, delhi, was, begun, under, muhammad, of, ghor, by, 1199, and, continued, under, qutb, al, din, aibak, and, later, sultans, the, quwwat, ul, islam, mosque, now, a, ruin, was, the, first, structure, like, other, early, islamic, buildings, it, re, used, elements, such, as, columns, from, destroyed, hindu, and, jain, temples, including, one, on, the, same, site, whose, platform, was, reused, the, style, was, iranian, but, the, arches, were, still, corbelled, in, the, traditional, indian, way, beside, it, is, the, extremely, tall, qutb, minar, a, minaret, or, victory, tower, whose, original, four, stages, reach, 73, meters, with, a, final, stage, added, later, its, closest, comparator, is, the, 62, metre, all, brick, minaret, of, jam, in, afghanistan, of, c, 1190, a, decade, or, so, before, the, probable, start, of, the, delhi, tower, the, surfaces, of, both, are, elaborately, decorated, with, inscriptions, and, geometric, patterns, in, delhi, the, shaft, is, fluted, with, superb, stalactite, bracketing, under, the, balconies, at, the, top, of, each, stage, in, general, minarets, were, slow, to, be, used, in, india, and, are, often, detached, from, the, main, mosque, where, they, exist, the, tomb, of, iltutmish, was, added, by, 1236, its, dome, the, squinches, again, corbelled, and, is, now, missing, and, the, intricate, carving, has, been, described, as, having, an, angular, harshness, from, carvers, working, in, an, unfamiliar, tradition, other, elements, were, added, to, the, complex, over, the, next, two, centuries, another, very, early, mosque, begun, in, the, 1190s, is, the, adhai, din, ka, jhonpra, in, ajmer, rajasthan, built, for, the, same, delhi, rulers, again, with, corbelled, arches, and, domes, here, hindu, temple, columns, and, possibly, some, new, ones, are, piled, up, in, threes, to, achieve, extra, height, both, mosques, had, large, detached, screens, with, pointed, corbelled, arches, added, in, front, of, them, probably, under, iltutmish, a, couple, of, decades, later, in, these, the, central, arch, is, taller, in, imitation, of, an, iwan, at, ajmer, the, smaller, screen, arches, are, tentatively, cusped, for, the, first, time, in, india, by, around, 1300, true, domes, and, arches, with, voussoirs, were, being, built, the, ruined, tomb, of, balban, d, 1287, in, delhi, may, be, the, earliest, survival, the, alai, darwaza, gatehouse, at, the, qutb, complex, from, 1311, still, shows, a, cautious, approach, to, the, new, technology, with, very, thick, walls, and, a, shallow, dome, only, visible, from, a, certain, distance, or, height, bold, contrasting, colours, of, masonry, with, red, sandstone, and, white, marble, introduce, what, was, to, become, a, common, feature, of, indo, islamic, architecture, substituting, for, the, polychrome, tiles, used, in, persia, and, central, asia, the, pointed, arches, come, together, slightly, at, their, base, giving, a, mild, horseshoe, arch, effect, and, their, internal, edges, are, not, cusped, but, lined, with, conventionalized, spearhead, projections, possibly, representing, lotus, buds, jali, stone, openwork, screens, are, introduced, here, they, already, had, been, long, used, in, temples, the, tomb, of, shah, rukn, e, alam, built, 1320, to, 1324, in, multan, pakistan, is, a, large, octagonal, brick, built, mausoleum, with, polychrome, glazed, decoration, that, remains, much, closer, to, the, styles, of, iran, and, afghanistan, timber, is, also, used, internally, this, was, the, earliest, major, monument, of, the, tughlaq, dynasty, 1320, 1413, built, during, the, unsustainable, expansion, of, its, massive, territory, it, was, built, for, a, sufi, saint, rather, than, a, sultan, and, most, of, the, many, tughlaq, tombs, are, much, less, exuberant, the, tomb, of, the, founder, of, the, dynasty, ghiyath, al, din, tughluq, d, 1325, is, more, austere, but, impressive, like, a, hindu, temple, it, is, topped, with, a, small, amalaka, and, a, round, finial, like, a, kalasha, unlike, the, buildings, mentioned, previously, it, completely, lacks, carved, texts, and, sits, in, a, compound, with, high, walls, and, battlements, both, these, tombs, have, external, walls, sloping, slightly, inwards, by, 25, in, the, delhi, tomb, like, many, fortifications, including, the, ruined, tughlaqabad, fort, opposite, the, tomb, intended, as, the, new, capital, the, tughlaqs, had, a, corps, of, government, architects, and, builders, and, in, this, and, other, roles, employed, many, hindus, they, left, many, buildings, and, a, standardized, dynastic, style, the, third, sultan, firuz, shah, r, 1351, 88, is, said, to, have, designed, buildings, himself, and, was, the, longest, ruler, and, greatest, builder, of, the, dynasty, his, firoz, shah, palace, complex, started, 1354, at, hisar, haryana, is, a, ruin, but, parts, are, in, fair, condition, some, buildings, from, his, reign, take, forms, that, had, been, rare, or, unknown, in, islamic, buildings, he, was, buried, in, the, large, hauz, khas, complex, in, delhi, with, many, other, buildings, from, his, period, and, the, later, sultanate, including, several, small, domed, pavilions, supported, only, by, columns, by, this, time, islamic, architecture, in, india, had, adopted, some, features, of, earlier, indian, architecture, such, as, the, use, of, a, high, plinth, and, often, mouldings, around, its, edges, as, well, as, columns, and, brackets, and, hypostyle, halls, after, the, death, of, firoz, the, tughlaqs, declined, and, the, following, delhi, dynasties, were, weak, most, of, the, monumental, buildings, constructed, were, tombs, although, the, impressive, lodi, gardens, in, delhi, adorned, with, fountains, charbagh, gardens, ponds, tombs, and, mosques, were, constructed, by, the, late, lodi, dynasty, the, architecture, of, other, regional, muslim, states, was, often, more, impressive, while, the, sacking, of, cities, was, not, uncommon, in, medieval, warfare, the, army, of, the, delhi, sultanate, also, often, destroyed, cities, in, their, military, expeditions, according, to, jain, chronicler, jinaprabha, suri, nusrat, khan, s, conquests, destroyed, hundreds, of, towns, including, ashapalli, modern, day, ahmedabad, anhilvad, modern, day, patan, vanthali, and, surat, in, gujarat, this,
