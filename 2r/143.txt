throughout, the, irrawaddy, river, basin, halin, founded, in, the, 1st, century, ad, was, the, largest, and, most, important, city, until, around, the, 7th, or, 8th, century, when, it, was, superseded, by, sri, ksetra, near, modern, pyay, at, the, southern, edge, of, the, pyu, realm, twice, as, large, as, halin, sri, ksetra, was, eventually, the, largest, and, most, influential, pyu, centre, only, the, city, states, of, halin, beikthano, and, sri, ksetra, are, designated, as, unesco, world, heritage, sites, where, the, other, sites, can, be, added, in, the, future, for, an,

had, assumed, the, burman, ethnicity, the, histories, and, legends, of, the, pyu, were, also, incorporated, to, those, of, the, bamar, based, on, limited, archaeological, evidence, it, is, inferred, that, the, earliest, cultures, existed, in, burma, as, early, as, 11, 000, bce, mainly, in, the, central, dry, zone, close, to, the, irrawaddy, the, anyathian, burma, s, stone, age, existed, around, the, same, time, as, the, lower, and, middle, paleolithic, eras, in, europe, three, caves, located, near, taunggyi, at, the, foothills, of, the, shan, hills, have, yielded, neolithic, artefacts, dated, to, 10, 000, 6000, bce, about, 1500, bce, people, in, the, region, were, turning, copper, into, bronze, growing, rice, and, domesticating, chickens, and, pigs, they, were, among, the, first,

earthenware, remains, have, been, excavated, archaeological, evidence, at, samon, river, valley, south, of, mandalay, suggests, rice, growing, settlements, that, traded, with, china, between, 500, bce, and, 200, ce, in, about, the, 2nd, century, bce, the, tibeto, burman, speaking, pyu, people, began, to, enter, the, irrawaddy, river, valley, from, present, day, yunnan, using, the, taping, and, shweli, rivers, the, original, home, of, the, pyu, is, reconstructed, to, be, qinghai, lake, which, is, located, in, the, present, day, provinces, of, qinghai, and, gansu, the, pyu, the, earliest, inhabitants, of, burma, of, whom, records, are, extant, went, on, to, found, settlements, throughout, the, plains, region, centred, on, the, confluence, of, the, irrawaddy, and, chindwin, rivers, that, has, been, inhabited, since, the, paleolithic, the, pyu, realm, was, longer, than, wide, stretching, from, sri, ksetra, in, the, south, to, halin, in, the, north, binnaka, and, maingmaw, to, the, east, and, probably, ayadawkye, to, the, west, the, tang, dynasty, s, records, report, 18, pyu, states, nine, of, which, were, walled, cities, covering, 298, districts, the, pyu, were, the, earliest, people, in, southeast, asia, to, welcome, in, and, adapt, to, brahmic, scripts, in, order, to, record, their, tonal, language, inventing, tonal, markers, the, pyu, shared, a, type, of,

quite, some, time, in, beikthano, in, the, yin, river, valley, than, the, nawin, river, valley, at, sri, ksetra, because, they, proved, their, skills, of, water, control, using, irrigation, systems, depended, on, their, good, knowledge, of, the, conditions, in, each, locality, and, area, according, to, stargardt, in, from, the, iron, age, to, early, cities, at, srikestra, and, beikthano, myanmar, journal, of, southeast, asian, studies, all, the, archaeology, found, a, lot, of, major, inscriptions, on, stone, in, phy, language, survive, at, sri, kestra, pyu, hanlin, and, near, pinle, hmainmaw, and, pagan, bagan, they, have, strong, evidence, on, the, people, were, living, in, that, century, between, the, third, fourth, and, fifth, sixth, centuries, ce, all, the, record, was, nominated, by,

walled, cities, and, several, smaller, non, fortified, settlements, located, at, or, near, the, three, most, important, irrigated, regions, of, precolonial, burma, the, mu, river, valley, in, the, north, the, kyaukse, plains, in, centre, and, the, minbu, region, in, the, south, and, west, of, the, former, two, the, city, states, were, contemporaries, of, the, kingdom, of, funan, cambodia, and, perhaps, champa, southern, vietnam, dvaravati, thailand, tambralinga, and, takuapa, near, the, kra, isthmus, and, srivijaya, southeast, sumatra, all, these, statelets, foreshadowed, the, rise, of, the, classical, kingdoms, of, southeast, asia, in, the, second, millennium, ce, it, was, a, long, lasting, civilisation, that, lasted, nearly, a, millennium, to, the, early, 9th, century, until, a, new, group, of, swift, horsemen, from, the, north, the, mranma, burmans, of, the, nanzhao, kingdom, entered, the, upper, irrawaddy, valley, through, a, series, of, raids, according, to, the, tang, dynasty, chronicles, the, nanzhao, began, their, raids, of, upper, burma, starting, as, early, as, 754, or, 760, by, 763, the, nanzhao, king, ko, lo, feng, had, conquered, the, upper, irrawaddy, valley, 95, nanzhao, raids, intensified, in, the, 9th, century, with, the, nanzhao, raiding, in, 800, 802, and, again, in, 808, 809, finally, according, to, the, chinese, in, 832, the, nanzhao, warriors, overran, the, pyu, country, and, took, away, 3000, pyu, prisoners, from, halin, 105, in, 835, the, chinese, records, say, the, nanzhao, also, raided, a, state, generally, identified, by, some, but, not, universally, accepted, to, be, a, pyu, state, to, be, sure, the, pyu, and, their, culture, did, not, disappear, just, because, 3000, of, them, were, taken, away, the, size, of, the, pyu, realm, and, its, many, walled, cities, throughout, the, land, indicates, a, population, many, times, over, indeed, no, firm, indications, at, sri, ksetra, or, at, any, other, pyu, site, exist, to, suggest, a, violent, overthrow, it, is, more, likely, that, these, raids, significantly, weakened, the, pyu, states, enabling, the, burmans, to, move, into, pyu, territories, at, any, rate, evidence, shows, that, the, actual, pace, of, burman, migration, into, the, pyu, realm, was, gradual, radiocarbon, dating, shows, that, human, activity, existed, until, c, 870, at, halin, the, subject, of, the, 832, nanzhao, raid, the, burmese, chronicles, claim, the, burmans, founded, the, fortified, city, of, pagan, bagan, in, 849, but, the, oldest, radiocarbon, dated, evidence, at, pagan, old, walls, points, to, 980, ce, while, the, main, walls, point, to, circa, 1020, ce, just, 24, years, earlier, than, the, beginning, of, the, reign, of, anawrahta, the, founder, of, pagan, empire, at, any, rate, the, burmans, had, overtaken, the, leadership, of, the, pyu, realm, by, the, late, 10th, century, and, went, on, to, found, the, pagan, empire, in, the, middle, of, the, 11th, century, unifying, the, irrawaddy, valley, and, its, periphery, for, the, first, time, nonetheless, the, pyu, had, left, an, indelible, mark, on, pagan, whose, burman, rulers, would, incorporate, the, histories, and, legends, of, the, pyu, as, their, own, the, burman, kings, of, pagan, claimed, descent, from, the, kings, of, sri, ksetra, and, tagaung, as, far, back, as, 850, bce, a, claim, dismissed, by, most, modern, scholars, pyu, settlements, remained, in, upper, burma, for, the, next, three, centuries, but, the, pyu, gradually, were, absorbed, and, assimilated, into, the, expanding, pagan, empire, the, pyu, language, still, existed, until, the, late, 12th, century, but, by, the, 13th, century, the, pyu, had, assumed, the, burman, ethnicity, and, disappeared, into, history, of, the, 12, walled, cities, excavated, thus, far, five, are, the, remains, of, largest, pyu, states, beikthano, maingmaw, binnaka, halin, and, sri, ksetra, beikthano, burmese, situated, in, the,

been, excavated, within, the, city, walls, maingmaw, also, called, mong, mao, not, to, be, confused, with, mong, mao, located, in, the, kyaukse, region, was, circular, in, shape, and, has, tentatively, been, dated, to, the, first, millennium, bce, it, is, also, sometimes, called, pinle, after, the, village, near, its, modern, site, in, myittha, township, and, should, not, the, confused,

though, no, scientific, dating, has, confirmed, it, excavations, the, first, of, which, was, carried, out, in, 1979, have, unearthed, many, artefacts, including, jewellery, silver, coins, and, funerary, urns, many, of, the, artefacts, such, as, the, coins, and, funerary, urns, are, virtually, identical, to, those, found, beikthano, and, binnaka, binnaka, too, was, located, in, the, kyaukse,

writing, on, it, and, funerary, urns, virtually, identical, to, those, found, beikthano, and, binnaka, both, maingmaw, and, binnaka, may, have, been, contemporary, of, beikthano, the, chronicles, which, do, not, mention, beikthano, at, all, do, mention, the, two, though, not, specifically, as, pyu, cities, the, chronicles, state, that, the, ruler, of, binnaka, was, responsible, for, the, fall, of, tagaung, the, city, identified, by, the, chronicles, as, the, original, home, of, burmese, speakers, binnaka, was, inhabited, until, about, the, 19th, century, according, to, a, konbaung, era, palm, leaf, sittan, record, discovered, there, halin, or, halingyi, located, in, the, mu, valley, one, of, the, largest, irrigated, regions, of, precolonial, burma, is, the, northernmost, pyu, city, so, far, discovered, the, earliest, artefacts, of, halin, city, s, wooden, gates, are, radiocarbon, dated, to, 70, ce, the, city, was, rectangular, but, with, curved, corners, and, brick, walled, excavated, walls, are, approximately, 3, 2, km, 2, 0, mi, long, on, the, north, south, axis, and, 1, 6, km, 0, 99, mi, on, the, east, west, at, 664, hectares, the, city, was, nearly, twice, the, size, of, beikthano, it, has, four, main, gates, at, the, cardinal, points, and, a, total, of, 12, gates, based, on, the, zodiac, a, river, or, canal, ran, through, the, city, traces, of, a, moat, exist, on, all, sides, except, the, south, where, it, was, probably, not, needed, as, land, was, dammed, there, to, create, reservoirs, this, design, of, the, city, influenced, the, city, planning, of, later, burmese, cities, and, the, siamese, city, of, sukhothai, for, example, the, number, of, gates, and, configuration, was, also, found, in, subsequent, major, burmese, capitals, such, as, the, 11th, century, pagan, and, 19th, century, mandalay, the, city, s, configuration, was, also, found, at, other, contemporary, cities, such, as, maingmaw, and, beikthano, in, the, pyu, realm, and, danyawaddy, and, wethali, in, arakan, as, well, as, later, cities, such, as, sukhothai, which, emerged, over, a, millennium, later, structural, remains, of, temples, at, halin, show, that, the, design, of, city, s, temples, influenced, the, 11th, to, 13th, century, temples, at, pagan, excavated, artefacts, point, to, halin, s, pyu, script, to, be, the, earliest, writing, in, the, pyu, realm, and, in, burma, it, was, based, on, an, earlier, version, of, the, brahmi, script, mauryan, and, guptan, inscriptions, at, sri, ksetra, show, a, later, version, of, the, same, script, known, for, the, production, of, salt, a, highly, prized, commodity, in, the, first, millennium, halin, was, superseded, by, sri, ksetra, as, the, premier, pyu, city, state, circa, 7th, century, by, the, chinese, accounts, halin, remained, an, important, pyu, centre, until, the, 9th, century, when, the, pyu, realm, came, under, repeated, attacks, from, the, nanzhao, kingdom, the, chinese, records, state, that, the, city, was, destroyed, by, the, nanzhao, warriors, in, 832, ce, with, 3000, of, its, inhabitants, taken, away, however, radiocarbon, dating, reveals, human, activity, to, about, 870, ce, nearly, four, decades, after, the, reported, sack, of, the, city, sri, ksetra, or, thaye, khittaya, lit, field, of, fortune, or, field, of, glory, located, 8, km, 5, 0, mi, southeast, of, prome, pyay, at, present, day, hmawza, village, was, the, last, and, southernmost, pyu, capital, the, city, was, founded, between, the, 5th, and, 7th, centuries, 62, 63, 77, although, during, two, of, the, recent, excavations, january, to, february, 2015, and, december, 2015, to, february, 2016, led, by, janice, stargardt, in, yahanda, mound, at, sri, ksetra, sherds, stamped, with, buddhist, motifs, were, found, dated, from, c, 340, 30, ce, and, pyu, culture, cremation, burials, around, 270, 30, ce, sri, ksetra, likely, overtook, halin, as, the, premier, pyu, city, by, the, 7th, or, 8th, century, and, retained, that, status, until, the, mranma, arrived, in, the, 9th, century, the, city, was, home, to, at, least, two, dynasties, and, maybe, three, the, first, dynasty, called, the, vikrama, dynasty, is, believed, to, have, launched, the, pyu, calendar, which, later, became, the, burmese, calendar, on, 22, march, 638, the, second, dynasty, was, founded, by, king, duttabaung, on, 25, march, 739, 11th, waxing, of, tagu, 101, me, sri, ksetra, is, the, largest, pyu, site, discovered, thus, far, only, beikthano, and, sri, ksetra, have, been, extensively, excavated, other, important, pyu, cities, as, maingmaw, and, binnaka, could, yield, more, artefacts, with, more, extensive, excavations, it, occupied, a, larger, area, than, that, of, the, 11th, century, pagan, or, 19th, century, mandalay, circular, in, design, sri, ksetra, was, more, than, 13, km, 8, 1, mi, in, circumference, and, three, to, four, km, across, or, about, 1400, hectares, of, occupied, area, the, city, s, brick, walls, were, 4, 5, metres, 15, ft, high, and, had, 12, gates, with, huge, devas, deities, guarding, the, entrances, and, a, pagoda, at, each, of, the, four, corners, it, also, has, curving, gateways, such, as, those, found, at, halin, and, beikthano, in, the, centre, of, the, city, was, what, most, scholars, think, represented, the, rectangular, palace, site, 518, by, 343, metres, 1, 699, ft, 1, 125, ft, symbolising, both, a, mandala, and, a, zata, horoscope, like, in, maingmaw, only, the, southern, half, of, the, city, was, taken, up, by, the, palace, monasteries, and, houses, the, entire, northern, half, consisted, of, rice, fields, together, with, the, moats, and, walls, this, arrangement, ensured, that, the, city, could, withstand, a, long, siege, by, enemies, sri, ksetra, was, an, important, entrep, t, between, china, and, india, it, was, located, on, the, irrawaddy, not, far, from, the, sea, as, the, irrawaddy, delta, had, not, yet, been, formed, ships, from, the, indian, ocean, could, come, up, to, prome, to, trade, with, the, pyu, realm, and, china, trade, with, india, brought, deep, cultural, contacts, sri, ksetra, has, yielded, the, most, extensive, remains, of, theravada, buddhism, religious, art, suggests, several, distinct, occupations, with, earlier, influences, stemming, from, southeast, india, and, later, influences, from, southwest, india, while, 9th, century, influences, include, those, from, the, nanzhao, kingdom, much, of, the, chinese, account, of, the, pyu, states, was, through, sri, ksetra, chinese, pilgrims, xuanzang, in, 648, and, yijing, in, 675, mentioned, sri, ksetra, in, their, accounts, of, buddhist, kingdoms, of, southeast, asia, the, tang, histories, mention, the, arrival, at, the, court, of, an, embassy, from, the, pyu, capital, in, 801, a, small, but, politically, significant, pyu, site, is, tagaung, located, in, tagaung, mandalay, region, about, 200, km, north, of, mandalay, where, pyu, artefacts, including, funerary, urns, have, been, excavated, tagaung, pottery, is, similar, in, size, and, cluster, positions, to, other, pyu, vessels, but, is, otherwise, very, different, to, those, further, south, this, may, indicate, a, degree, of, influence, from, other, sources, or, that, it, is, markedly, different, from, the, central, pyu, culture, the, significance, of, tagaung, is, due, to, the, fact, that, the, burmese, chronicles, identify, tagaung, as, the, home, of, the, first, burmese, kingdom, aside, from, beikthano, and, sri, ksetra, most, pyu, sites, have, not, seen, extensive, or, any, excavation, the, lost, city, described, as, pinle, pyu, lit, sea, pyu, is, recorded, as, being, located, next, to, the, sea, unlike, many, other, small, pyu, sites, the, city, is, speculated, to, be, large, in, size, located, downstream, from, sri, ksetra, some, archaeologists, believe, that, ruins, near, ingapu, ayeyarwady, region, may, be, the, location, of, pinle, pyu, historian, phone, tint, kyaw, led, a, team, to, study, the, area, in, 2009, and, concluded, the, site, may, be, a, pyu, site, based, on, the, use, of, brahmi, script, a, script, that, dates, towards, the, third, century, bc, and, the, architectural, similarities, to, other, pyu, sites, particularly, a, site, in, shwedaung, bago, region, further, up, the, irrawaddy, river, the, ancient, site, itself, was, built, symmetrically, on, a, mountain, ridge, designed, around, stupas, and, water, features, based, on, its, scale, and, the, administrative, societal, structures, of, the, pyu, period, the, city, would, have, been, built, by, a, monarch, rather, than, a, feudal, lord, its, absence, in, the, bagan, kingdom, s, fourth, period, records, also, indicates, that, the, city, likely, fell, into, ruin, well, before, the, 11th, century, ad, however, more, evidence, and, investigation, is, required, to, analyze, the, ancient, artifacts, found, in, the, site, finds, from, another, site, nearby, include, paleolithic, tools, and, fossilized, footprints, indicate, that, the, overall, area, may, be, older, than, other, pyu, sites, the, new, history, of, the, tang, states, the, kingdom, of, mi, ch, en, sent, an, embassy, to, china, in, 805, and, was, attacked, by, nanchao, in, 835, 106, many, pyu, settlements, have, been, found, across, upper, burma, in, myinmu, township, near, the, mouth, of, the, mu, river, one, notable, site, is, ayadawkye, ywa, in, the, mu, valley, west, of, halin, lies, south, of, another, recently, discovered, bronze, age, site, called, nyaunggan, further, south, in, myingyan, township, west, of, maingmaw, the, wati, site, also, spelled, wa, tee, is, the, remnants, of, a, circular, walled, city, there, were, also, pyu, settlements, in, lower, burma, that, may, have, been, ignored, or, overlooked, by, the, historical, records, aimed, at, legitimizing, upper, burmese, kings, lineage, the, sagara, thagara, site, in, dawei, is, one, such, site, comparable, to, tagaung, archaeological, excavations, in, 2001, revealed, several, artifacts, including, terracotta, urns, in, rice, fields, southeast, of, the, walled, site, near, sagara, the, site, of, mokti, has, also, revealed, similar, artifacts, the, stupa, in, sagara, and, votive, tablets, found, at, the, site, of, mokti, are, considered, to, have, many, pyu, cultural, traits, but, other, artifacts, show, evidence, of, many, cultural, influences, the, economy, of, the, pyu, city, states, was, based, on, agriculture, and, trade, all, important, pyu, settlements, were, located, in, the, three, main, irrigated, regions, of, upper, burma, centred, on, the, confluence, of, the, irrawaddy, and, chindwin, rivers, halin, in, the, mu, valley, maingmaw, and, binnaka, in, the, kyaukse, plains, finally, beikthano, and, sri, ksetra, at, or, near, the, minbu, district, the, irrigation, projects, of, the, pyu, were, later, picked, up, by, the, burmans, king, anawrahta, of, pagan, would, build, irrigation, projects, in, these, three, regions, in, the, 1050s, to, turn, them, into, the, main, rice, granaries, of, upper, burma, they, would, give, upper, burma, an, enduring, economic, base, from, which, to, dominate, the, irrawaddy, valley, and, its, periphery, in, the, following, centuries, the, pyu, grew, rice, perhaps, of, the, japonica, variety, the, pyu, realm, was, an, important, trading, centre, between, china, and, india, in, the, first, millennium, ce, two, main, trading, routes, passed, through, the, pyu, states, as, early, as, 128, bce, an, overland, trade, route, between, china, and, india, existed, across, the, northern, burma, an, embassy, from, the, roman, empire, to, china, passed, through, this, route, in, 97, ce, and, again, in, 120, ce, but, the, majority, of, the, trade, was, conducted, by, sea, through, the, southern, pyu, states, which, at, the, time, were, located, not, far, from, the, sea, as, much, of, the, irrawaddy, delta, had, not, yet, been, formed, and, as, far, south, as, upper, tenasserim, coast, towns, such, as, winga, hsindat, myindat, sanpannagon, and, mudon, where, pyu, artefacts, have, been, found, it, is, insufficient, to, conclude, however, that, the, pyu, had, administrative, and, military, control, over, these, upper, tenasserim, coastal, towns, the, ports, connected, the, overland, trade, route, to, china, via, present, day, yunnan, the, trading, area, of, the, pyu, states, spanned, across, the, present, day, southeast, asia, south, asia, and, china, artifacts, from, the, 2nd, century, northwest, india, to, java, and, the, philippines, have, been, found, at, beikthano, likewise, pyu, artefacts, have, been, found, along, the, coasts, of, arakan, lower, burma, and, as, far, east, as, c, eo, in, present, day, southern, vietnam, the, pyu, also, conducted, trade, and, diplomatic, relations, with, china, in, 800, and, 801, 802, sri, ksetra, sent, a, formal, embassy, along, with, 35, musicians, to, the, tang, court, according, to, the, chinese, the, pyu, used, gold, and, silver, coinage, but, only, silver, coins, have, survived, a, notable, feature, of, the, pyu, states, is, the, minting, and, use, of, silver, coinage, originated, in, the, pegu, area, these, coins, date, from, the, 5th, century, and, were, the, model, for, most, first, millennium, coinage, in, mainland, southeast, asia, the, earliest, type, of, these, coins, is, not, inscribed, and, depicts, a, conch, on, one, side, and, a, srivatsa, on, the, other, many, of, the, coins, had, a, small, hole, along, the, perimeter, and, may, have, also, been, used, as, amulets, remarkably, after, the, use, of, coins, ceased, at, the, end, of, pyu, period, in, the, late, 9th, century, coins, did, not, reappear, in, the, burmese, kingdoms, until, the, 19th, century, the, culture, of, pyu, city, states, was, heavily, influenced, by, india, indian, culture, was, most, visible, in, the, southern, pyu, realm, through, which, most, trade, with, india, was, conducted, by, sea, the, names, of, southernmost, cities, were, in, pali, or, sanskrit, derived, like, sri, ksetra, thaye, khittaya, and, vishnu, beikthano, the, kings, at, sri, ksetra, titled, themselves, as, varmans, and, varma, it, was, not, just, a, southern, phenomenon, to, varying, degrees, northern, pyu, cities, and, towns, also, became, under, the, sway, of, indian, culture, the, burmese, chronicles, claim, that, the, founding, kings, of, tagaung, were, descended, from, no, less, than, the, sakya, clan, of, the, buddha, himself, by, the, 4th, century, most, of, the, pyu, had, become, predominantly, buddhist, though, archaeological, finds, prove, that, their, pre, buddhist, practices, remained, firmly, entrenched, in, the, following, centuries, according, to, the, excavated, texts, as, well, as, the, chinese, records, the, predominant, religion, of, the, pyu, was, theravada, buddhism, the, theravada, school, prevalent, in, the, pyu, realm, was, probably, derived, from, the, andhra, region, in, southeast, india, associated, with, the, famous, theravada, buddhist, scholar, buddhagosa, it, was, the, predominant, theravada, school, in, burma, until, the, late, 12th, century, when, shin, uttarajiva, led, the, realignment, with, ceylon, s, mahavihara, school, the, archaeological, finds, also, indicate, a, widespread, presence, of, tantric, buddhism, mahayana, buddhism, and, hinduism, avalokite, vara, lokanatha, called, lawkanat, in, burmese, tara, manusi, buddhas, vai, rava, a, and, hayagriva, all, prominent, in, mahayana, buddhism, were, very, much, part, of, pyu, and, later, the, pagan, iconography, scene, various, hindu, brahman, iconography, ranging, from, the, hindu, trinity, brahma, vishnu, and, shiva, to, garuda, and, lakshmi, have, been, found, especially, in, lower, burma, non, theravada, practices, such, as, ceremonial, cattle, sacrifice, and, alcohol, consumption, were, main, stays, of, the, pyu, life, likewise, the, greater, prominence, of, nuns, and, female, students, than, in, the, later, eras, may, point, to, pre, buddhist, notions, of, female, autonomy, in, melding, of, their, pre, buddhist, practices, to, buddhist, ones, they, placed, the, remains, of, their, cremated, dead, in, pottery, and, stone, urns, and, buried, them, in, or, near, isolated, stupas, a, practice, consistent, with, early, buddhist, practices, of, interring, the, remains, of, holy, personages, in, stupas, though, their, religious, beliefs, was, a, syncretic, mix, of, many, backgrounds, probably, like, in, the, early, pagan, period, the, outlook, of, the, pyu, reportedly, was, largely, peaceful, tang, chinese, records, describe, the, pyu, as, a, humane, and, peaceful, people, to, whom, war, was, virtually, unknown, and, who, wore, silk, cotton, instead, of, actually, silk, so, that, they, would, not, have, to, kill, silk, worms, and, that, many, pyu, boys, entered, the, monastic, life, at, seven, to, the, age, of, 20, to, be, sure, this, peaceful, description, by, the, chinese, was, a, snapshot, of, the, pyu, realm, and, may, not, represent, the, life, in, the, city, states, in, general, the, pyu, language, was, a, tibeto, burman, language, related, to, old, burmese, but, it, apparently, co, existed, with, sanskrit, and, pali, as, the, court, language, the, chinese, records, state, that, the, 35, musicians, that, accompanied, the, pyu, embassy, to, the, tang, court, in, 800, 802, played, music, and, sang, in, the, fan, sanskrit, language, many, of, the, important, inscriptions, were, written, in, sanskrit, and, or, pali, alongside, the, pyu, script, recent, scholarship, though, yet, not, settled, suggests, that, the, pyu, script, based, on, the, brahmi, script, may, have, been, the, source, of, the, burmese, script, used, to, write, the, burmese, language, the, pyu, sites, have, yielded, a, wide, variety, of, indian, scripts, from, king, ashoka, s, edicts, written, in, north, indian, brahmi, and, tamil, brahmi, both, dated, to, the, 3rd, and, 2nd, centuries, bce, to, the, gupta, script, and, kannada, script, dated, to, the, 4th, to, 6th, centuries, ce, in, addition, to, religion, the, pyu, also, imported, science, and, astronomical, expertise, from, india, the, chinese, records, also, report, that, the, pyu, knew, how, to, make, astronomical, calculations, the, pyu, calendar, was, based, on, the, buddhist, calendar, there, were, two, eras, in, use, the, first, was, the, sakra, era, which, was, adopted, in, the, pyu, realm, in, 80, ce, just, two, years, after, the, new, era, had, come, into, use, in, india, a, second, calendar, was, adopted, at, sri, ksetra, in, 638, superseding, the, sakra, era, the, calendar, the, first, day, of, which, was, 22, march, 638, later, became, the, burmese, calendar, and, is, still, in, use, in, present, day, myanmar, the, existence, of, two, pyu, calendars, has, been, cause, for, dispute, among, scholars, trying, interpret, the, dates, on, the, finds, the, pyu, era, architectural, practices, greatly, influenced, later, pagan, and, burmese, architecture, the, techniques, of, building, dams, canals, and, weirs, found, in, pre, colonial, upper, burma, trace, their, origins, to, the, pyu, era, and, the, pagan, era, burmans, likely, introduced, new, water, management, methods, especially, the, canal, building, techniques, which, became, the, prevailing, method, of, irrigation, in, the, pagan, era, the, pyu, city, plans, consisted, of, square, rectangles, and, circles, were, a, mix, of, indigenous, and, indian, designs, it, is, believed, that, circular, patterns, inside, the, cities, were, pyu, while, the, rectangle, or, square, shape, of, the, outer, walls, and, the, use, of, 12, gates, were, indian, in, origin, according, to, historian, cooler, the, adoption, of, indian, concepts, of, city, planning, incorporated, a, belief, in, the, efficacy, of, the, world, axis, that, connects, the, centermost, point, in, a, properly, constructed, mandala, city, with, the, city, of, the, gods, above, tavatimsa, heaven, in, order, to, assure, prosperity, throughout, the, kingdom, below, pyu, era, city, practices, were, the, forefathers, of, the, latter, day, burmese, city, and, palace, designs, down, to, the, 19th, century, mandalay, from, the, 4th, century, onward, the, pyu, built, many, buddhist, stupas, and, other, religious, buildings, the, styles, ground, plans, even, the, brick, size, and, construction, techniques, of, these, buildings, point, to, the, andhra, region, particularly, amaravati, and, nagarjunakonda, in, present, day, southeastern, india, some, evidence, of, ceylonese, contact, is, seen, by, the, presence, of, anuradhapura, style, moonstones, discovered, at, beikthano, and, halin, by, perhaps, the, 7th, century, tall, cylindrical, stupas, such, as, the, bawbawgyi, payagyi, and, payama, had, emerged, at, sri, ksetra, the, pyu, architecture, greatly, influenced, later, burmese, buddhist, temple, designs, for, example, temples, at, sri, ksetra, such, as, the, bebe, and, lemyethna, were, prototypes, for, the, later, hollow, gu, temples, of, pagan, the, floor, plan, of, the, 13th, century, somingyi, monastery, at, pagan, was, largely, identical, to, that, of, a, 4th, century, monastery, at, beikthano, the, solid, stupas, of, sri, ksetra, were, in, turn, prototypes, for, pagan, s, such, as, the, shwezigon, shwehsandaw, and, mingalazedi, and, ultimately, the, shwedagon, in, modern, yangon, the, city, states, were, mainly, populated, by, the, tibeto, burman, speaking, pyu, people, who, like, their, cousins, burmans, are, believed, to, have, migrated, from, the, present, qinghai, and, gansu, provinces, in, north, central, china, via, yunnan, extensive, external, trade, attracted, sizeable, communities, of, indians, and, the, mon, especially, in, the, south, in, the, north, trickles, of, burmans, may, have, entered, the, pyu, realm, from, yunnan, as, early, as, the, 7th, century, modern, scholarship, however, holds, that, burmans, did, not, arrive, in, large, numbers, until, the, mid, to, late, 9th, century, and, perhaps, as, late, as, the, 10th, century, according, to, radiocarbon, dating, of, pagan, s, walls, the, size, of, population, of, the, pyu, realm, was, probably, a, few, hundred, thousand, given, that, the, 17th, and, 18th, century, burma, about, the, size, of, present, day, myanmar, only, had, about, 2, million, people, the, pyu, settlements, were, ruled, by, independent, chiefs, the, chiefs, at, larger, city, states, later, styled, themselves, as, kings, and, established, courts, largely, modelled, after, the, indian, hindu, concepts, of, monarchy, not, all, hindu, concepts, such, as, divine, kingship, were, fully, adopted, due, to, the, presence, of, theravada, buddhism, it, is, not, clear, if, a, vassalage, overlord, relationship, existed, between, the, larger, city, states, and, smaller, towns, the, burmese, chronicles, mention, alliances, between, the, states, such, as, one, between, beikthano, and, sri, ksetra, by, and, large, each, pyu, city, state, appeared, to, have, controlled, just, the, city, itself, the, large, size, of, the, pyu, cities, 660, to, 1400, hectares, vis, a, vis, pagan, only, 140, hectares, suggests, that, much, of, the, population, resided, within, the, walls, as, corroborated, by, the, chinese, records, archaeology, in, pagan, produced, pyu, artefacts, across, a, number, of, the, settlements, in, the, enclosed, complex, dating, to, the, first, millennium, until, approximately, 1100, c, e, when, a, shift, to, a, monument, rich, state, and, diffusion, beyond, walled, boundaries, is, evident, aside, from, sri, ksetra, and, beikthano, the, rest, of, the, pyu, sites, have, not, been, extensively, excavated, the, care, of, the, sites, falls, under, the, purview, of, the, ministry, of, culture, s, department, of, archaeology, in, november, 2011, the, department, reportedly, was, planning, a, museum, at, sri, ksetra, and, working, with, the, unesco, to, gain, recognition, for, sri, ksetra, beikthano, and, halin, as, world, heritage, sites, and, the, three, old, cities, were, recognised, as, world, heritage, sites, in, 2014
