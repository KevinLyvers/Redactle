endured, for, over, five, centuries, until, 221, bc, when, it, assumed, an, imperial, prerogative, following, its, complete, conquest, of, its, rival, states, a, state, of, affairs, that, lasted, until, its, collapse, in, 206, bc, it, was, formally, established, after, the, conquests, in, 221, bc, when, ying, zheng, who, had, become, king, of, the, qin, state, in, 246, declared, himself, to, be, shi, huangdi, the, first, emperor, qin, was, a, minor, power, for, the, early, centuries, of, its, existence, the, strength, of, the, qin, state, was, greatly, increased, by, the, reforms, of, shang, yang, in, the, fourth, century, bc, during, the, warring, states, period, in, the, mid, and, late, third, century, bc, the, qin, state, carried, out, a, series, of, swift, conquests, destroying, the, powerless, zhou, dynasty, and, eventually, conquering, the, other, six, of, the, seven, warring, states, its, 15, year, duration, was, the, shortest, major, dynasty, in, chinese, history, with, only, two, emperors, despite, its, short, existence, the, legacy, of, qin, strategies, in, military, and, administrative, affairs, shaped, the, consummate, han, dynasty, that, followed, ultimately, becoming, seen, as, the, originator, of, an, imperial, system, that, lasted, from, 221, bc, with, interruption, evolution, and, adaptation, through, to, the, xinhai, revolution, in, 1911, the, qin, sought, to, create, a, state, unified, by, structured, centralized, political, power, and, a, large, military, supported, by, a, stable, economy, the, central, government, moved, to, undercut, aristocrats, and, landowners, to, gain, direct, administrative, control, over, the, peasantry, who, comprised, the, overwhelming, majority, of, the, population, and, labour, force, this, allowed, ambitious, projects, involving, three, hundred, thousand, peasants, and, convicts, projects, such, as, connecting, walls, along, the, northern, border, eventually, developing, into, the, great, wall, of, china, and, a, massive, new, national, road, system, as, well, as, the, city, sized, mausoleum, of, the, first, qin, emperor, guarded, by, the, life, sized, terracotta, army, the, qin, introduced, a, range, of, reforms, such, as, standardized, currency, weights, measures, and, a, uniform, system, of, writing, which, aimed, to, unify, the, state, and, promote, commerce, additionally, its, military, used, the, most, recent, weaponry, transportation, and, tactics, though, the, government, was, heavy, handed, and, bureaucratic, qin, created, a, system, of, administering, people, and, land, that, greatly, increased, the, power, of, the, government, to, transform, environment, and, it, has, been, argued, that, the, subsequent, impact, of, this, system, on, east, asia, s, environments, makes, the, rise, of, qin, an, important, event, in, china, s, environmental, history, when, the, first, emperor, died, in, 210, bc, two, of, his, advisors, placed, an, heir, on, the, throne, in, an, attempt, to, influence, and, control, the, administration, of, the, dynasty, these, advisors, squabbled, among, themselves, resulting, in, both, of, their, deaths, and, that, of, the, second, qin, emperor, popular, revolt, broke, out, and, the, weakened, empire, soon, fell, to, a, chu, general, xiang, yu, who, was, proclaimed, hegemon, king, of, western, chu, and, liu, bang, who, founded, the, han, dynasty, han, confucians, portrayed, the, qin, dynasty, as, a, monolithic, legalist, tyranny, notably, citing, a, purge, known, as, the, burning, of, books, and, burying, of, scholars, however, the, earliest, account, of, this, event, is, in, sima, qian, s, records, of, the, grand, historian, and, some, modern, scholars, dispute, its, veracity, according, to, the, records, of, the, grand, historian, in, the, 9th, century, bc, feizi, a, supposed, descendant, of, the, ancient, political, advisor, gao, yao, was, granted, rule, over, the, settlement, of, qin, in, present, day, qingshui, county, of, shaanxi, during, the, rule, of, king, xiao, of, zhou, the, eighth, king, of, the, zhou, dynasty, this, area, became, known, as, the, state, of, qin, in, 897, bc, under, the, gonghe, regency, the, area, became, a, dependency, allotted, for, the, purpose, of, raising, and, breeding, horses, one, of, feizi, s, descendants, duke, zhuang, became, favoured, by, king, ping, of, zhou, the, 13th, king, in, that, line, as, a, reward, zhuang, s, son, duke, xiang, was, sent, eastward, as, the, leader, of, a, war, expedition, during, which, he, formally, established, the, qin, the, state, of, qin, first, began, a, military, expedition, into, central, china, in, 672, bc, though, it, did, not, engage, in, any, serious, incursions, due, to, the, threat, from, neighbouring, tribesmen, by, the, dawn, of, the, fourth, century, bc, however, the, neighbouring, tribes, had, all, been, either, subdued, or, conquered, and, the, stage, was, set, for, the, rise, of, qin, expansionism, lord, shang, yang, a, qin, statesman, of, the, warring, states, period, introducing, a, number, of, militarily, advantageous, reforms, from, 361, bc, until, his, death, in, 338, bc, yang, also, helped, construct, the, qin, capital, commencing, in, the, mid, fourth, century, bc, xianyang, the, resulting, city, greatly, resembled, the, capitals, of, other, warring, states, notably, qin, engaged, in, practical, and, ruthless, warfare, during, the, spring, and, autumn, period, the, prevalent, philosophy, had, dictated, war, as, a, gentleman, s, activity, military, commanders, were, instructed, to, respect, what, they, perceived, to, be, heaven, s, laws, in, battle, for, example, when, duke, xiang, of, the, rival, state, of, song, was, at, war, with, the, state, of, chu, during, the, warring, states, period, he, declined, an, opportunity, to, attack, the, enemy, force, commanded, by, zhu, while, they, were, crossing, a, river, after, allowing, them, to, cross, and, marshal, their, forces, he, was, decisively, defeated, in, the, ensuing, battle, when, his, advisors, later, admonished, him, for, such, excessive, courtesy, to, the, enemy, he, retorted, the, sage, does, not, crush, the, feeble, nor, give, the, order, for, attack, until, the, enemy, have, formed, their, ranks, the, qin, disregarded, this, military, tradition, taking, advantage, of, their, enemy, s, weaknesses, a, nobleman, in, the, state, of, wei, accused, the, qin, state, of, being, avaricious, perverse, eager, for, profit, and, without, sincerity, it, knows, nothing, about, etiquette, proper, relationships, and, virtuous, conduct, and, if, there, be, an, opportunity, for, material, gain, it, will, disregard, its, relatives, as, if, they, were, animals, this, combined, with, a, strong, leadership, from, long, lived, rulers, openness, to, employ, talented, men, from, other, states, and, little, internal, opposition, gave, the, qin, a, strong, political, base, another, advantage, of, the, qin, was, that, they, had, a, large, efficient, army, and, capable, generals, they, utilised, the, newest, developments, in, weaponry, and, transportation, as, well, which, many, of, their, enemies, lacked, these, latter, developments, allowed, greater, mobility, over, several, different, terrain, types, which, were, most, common, in, many, regions, of, china, thus, in, both, ideology, and, practice, the, qin, were, militarily, superior, finally, the, qin, empire, had, a, geographical, advantage, due, to, its, fertility, and, strategic, position, protected, by, mountains, that, made, the, state, a, natural, stronghold, this, was, the, heart, of, the, guanzhong, region, as, opposed, to, the, yangtze, river, drainage, basin, known, as, guandong, the, warlike, nature, of, the, qin, in, guanzhong, inspired, a, han, dynasty, adage, guanzhong, produces, generals, while, guandong, produces, ministers, its, expanded, agricultural, output, helped, sustain, qin, s, large, army, with, food, and, natural, resources, the, wei, river, canal, built, in, 246, bc, was, particularly, significant, in, this, respect, during, the, warring, states, period, preceding, the, qin, dynasty, the, major, states, vying, for, dominance, were, yan, zhao, qi, chu, han, wei, and, qin, the, rulers, of, these, states, styled, themselves, as, kings, rather, than, using, the, titles, of, lower, nobility, they, had, previously, held, however, none, elevated, himself, to, believe, that, he, had, the, mandate, of, heaven, as, the, zhou, kings, had, claimed, nor, that, he, had, the, right, to, offer, sacrifices, they, left, this, to, the, zhou, rulers, before, their, conquest, in, the, fourth, and, third, centuries, bc, the, qin, suffered, several, setbacks, shang, yang, was, executed, in, 338, bc, by, king, huiwen, due, to, a, personal, grudge, harboured, from, his, youth, there, was, also, internal, strife, over, the, qin, succession, in, 307, bc, which, decentralised, qin, authority, somewhat, qin, was, defeated, by, an, alliance, of, the, other, states, in, 295, bc, and, shortly, after, suffered, another, defeat, by, the, state, of, zhao, because, the, majority, of, their, army, was, then, defending, against, the, qi, the, aggressive, statesman, fan, sui, however, soon, came, to, power, as, prime, minister, even, as, the, problem, of, the, succession, was, resolved, and, he, began, an, expansionist, policy, that, had, originated, in, jin, and, qi, which, prompted, the, qin, to, attempt, to, conquer, the, other, states, the, qin, were, swift, in, their, assault, on, the, other, states, they, first, attacked, the, han, directly, east, and, took, their, capital, city, of, xinzheng, in, 230, bc, they, then, struck, northward, the, state, of, zhao, surrendered, in, 228, bc, and, the, northernmost, state, of, yan, followed, falling, in, 226, bc, next, qin, armies, launched, assaults, to, the, east, and, later, the, south, as, well, they, took, the, wei, city, of, daliang, now, called, kaifeng, in, 225, bc, and, forced, the, chu, to, surrender, by, 223, bc, lastly, they, deposed, the, zhou, dynasty, s, remnants, in, luoyang, and, conquered, the, qi, taking, the, city, of, linzi, in, 221, bc, when, the, conquests, were, complete, in, 221, bc, king, zheng, who, had, first, assumed, the, throne, of, the, qin, state, at, age, 9, became, the, effective, ruler, of, china, the, subjugation, of, the, six, states, was, done, by, king, zheng, who, had, used, efficient, persuasion, and, exemplary, strategy, he, solidified, his, position, as, sole, ruler, with, the, abdication, of, his, prime, minister, l, buwei, the, states, made, by, the, emperor, were, assigned, to, officials, dedicated, to, the, task, rather, than, place, the, burden, on, people, from, the, royal, family, he, then, combined, the, titles, of, the, earlier, three, sovereigns, and, five, emperors, into, his, new, name, shi, huangdi, or, first, emperor, the, newly, declared, emperor, ordered, all, weapons, not, in, the, possession, of, the, qin, to, be, confiscated, and, melted, down, the, resulting, metal, was, sufficient, to, build, twelve, large, ornamental, statues, at, the, qin, s, newly, declared, capital, xianyang, in, 214, bc, qin, shi, huang, secured, his, boundaries, to, the, north, with, a, fraction, 100, 000, men, of, his, large, army, and, sent, the, majority, 500, 000, men, of, his, army, south, to, conquer, the, territory, of, the, southern, tribes, prior, to, the, events, leading, to, qin, dominance, over, china, they, had, gained, possession, of, much, of, sichuan, to, the, southwest, the, qin, army, was, unfamiliar, with, the, jungle, terrain, and, it, was, defeated, by, the, southern, tribes, guerrilla, warfare, tactics, with, over, 100, 000, men, lost, however, in, the, defeat, qin, was, successful, in, building, a, canal, to, the, south, which, they, used, heavily, for, supplying, and, reinforcing, their, troops, during, their, second, attack, to, the, south, building, on, these, gains, the, qin, armies, conquered, the, coastal, lands, surrounding, guangzhou, and, took, the, provinces, of, fuzhou, and, guilin, they, may, have, struck, as, far, south, as, hanoi, after, these, victories, in, the, south, qin, shi, huang, moved, over, 100, 000, prisoners, and, exiles, to, colonize, the, newly, conquered, area, in, terms, of, extending, the, boundaries, of, his, empire, the, first, emperor, was, extremely, successful, in, the, south, however, while, the, empire, at, times, was, extended, to, the, north, the, qin, could, rarely, hold, on, to, the, land, for, long, the, tribes, of, these, locations, collectively, called, the, hu, by, the, qin, were, free, from, chinese, rule, during, the, majority, of, the, dynasty, prohibited, from, trading, with, qin, dynasty, peasants, the, xiongnu, tribe, living, in, the, ordos, region, in, northwest, china, often, raided, them, instead, prompting, the, qin, to, retaliate, after, a, military, campaign, led, by, general, meng, tian, the, region, was, conquered, in, 215, bc, and, agriculture, was, established, the, peasants, however, were, discontented, and, later, revolted, the, succeeding, han, dynasty, also, expanded, into, the, ordos, due, to, overpopulation, but, depleted, their, resources, in, the, process, indeed, this, was, true, of, the, dynasty, s, borders, in, multiple, directions, modern, xinjiang, tibet, manchuria, inner, mongolia, and, regions, to, the, southeast, were, foreign, to, the, qin, and, even, areas, over, which, they, had, military, control, were, culturally, distinct, three, assassination, attempts, were, made, on, qin, shi, huang, leading, him, to, become, paranoid, and, obsessed, with, immortality, he, died, in, 210, bc, while, on, a, trip, to, the, far, eastern, reaches, of, his, empire, in, an, attempt, to, procure, an, elixir, of, immortality, from, taoist, magicians, who, claimed, the, elixir, was, stuck, on, an, island, guarded, by, a, sea, monster, the, chief, eunuch, zhao, gao, and, the, prime, minister, li, si, hid, the, news, of, his, death, upon, their, return, until, they, were, able, to, alter, his, will, to, place, on, the, throne, the, dead, emperor, s, most, pliable, son, huhai, who, took, the, name, of, qin, er, shi, they, believed, that, they, would, be, able, to, manipulate, him, to, their, own, ends, and, thus, effectively, control, the, empire, qin, er, shi, was, indeed, inept, and, pliable, he, executed, many, ministers, and, imperial, princes, continued, massive, building, projects, one, of, his, most, extravagant, projects, was, lacquering, the, city, walls, enlarged, the, army, increased, taxes, and, arrested, messengers, who, brought, him, bad, news, as, a, result, men, from, all, over, china, revolted, attacking, officials, raising, armies, and, declaring, themselves, kings, of, seized, territories, during, this, time, li, si, and, zhao, gao, fell, out, and, li, si, was, executed, zhao, gao, decided, to, force, qin, er, shi, to, commit, suicide, due, to, qin, er, shi, s, incompetence, upon, this, ziying, a, nephew, of, qin, er, shi, ascended, the, throne, and, immediately, executed, zhao, gao, ziying, seeing, that, increasing, unrest, was, growing, among, the, people, and, that, many, local, officials, had, declared, themselves, kings, attempted, to, cling, to, his, throne, by, declaring, himself, one, king, among, all, the, others, he, was, undermined, by, his, ineptitude, however, and, popular, revolt, broke, out, in, 209, bc, when, chu, rebels, under, the, lieutenant, liu, bang, attacked, a, state, in, such, turmoil, could, not, hold, for, long, ziying, was, defeated, near, the, wei, river, in, 207, bc, and, surrendered, shortly, after, he, was, executed, by, the, chu, leader, xiang, yu, the, qin, capital, was, destroyed, the, next, year, and, this, is, considered, by, historians, to, be, the, end, of, the, qin, empire, liu, bang, then, betrayed, and, defeated, xiang, yu, declaring, himself, emperor, gaozu, of, the, new, han, dynasty, on, 28, february, 202, bc, despite, the, short, duration, of, the, qin, dynasty, it, was, very, influential, on, the, structure, of, future, dynasties, the, aristocracy, of, the, qin, were, largely, similar, in, their, culture, and, daily, life, regional, variations, in, culture, were, considered, a, symbol, of, the, lower, classes, this, stemmed, from, the, zhou, and, was, seized, upon, by, the, qin, as, such, variations, were, seen, as, contrary, to, the, unification, that, the, government, strove, to, achieve, commoners, and, rural, villagers, who, made, up, over, 90, of, the, population, very, rarely, left, the, villages, or, farmsteads, where, they, were, born, forms, of, employment, differed, by, region, though, farming, was, almost, universally, common, professions, were, hereditary, a, father, s, employment, was, passed, to, his, eldest, son, after, he, died, the, l, shi, chunqiu, gave, examples, of, how, when, commoners, are, obsessed, with, material, wealth, instead, of, the, idealism, of, a, man, who, makes, things, serve, him, they, were, reduced, to, the, service, of, things, peasants, were, rarely, figured, in, literature, during, the, qin, dynasty, and, afterwards, scholars, and, others, of, more, elite, status, preferred, the, excitement, of, cities, and, the, lure, of, politics, one, notable, exception, to, this, was, shen, nong, the, so, called, divine, father, who, taught, that, households, should, grow, their, own, food, if, in, one, s, prime, he, does, not, plow, someone, in, the, world, will, grow, hungry, if, in, one, s, prime, she, does, not, weave, someone, in, the, world, will, be, cold, the, qin, encouraged, this, a, ritual, was, performed, once, every, few, years, that, consisted, of, important, government, officials, taking, turns, with, the, plow, on, a, special, field, to, create, a, simulation, of, government, interest, and, activity, within, agriculture, warring, states, era, architecture, had, several, definitive, aspects, city, walls, used, for, defense, were, made, longer, and, indeed, several, secondary, walls, were, also, sometimes, built, to, separate, the, different, districts, versatility, in, federal, structures, was, emphasized, to, create, a, sense, of, authority, and, absolute, power, architectural, elements, such, as, high, towers, pillar, gates, terraces, and, high, buildings, amply, conveyed, this, the, written, language, of, the, qin, was, logographic, as, that, of, the, zhou, had, been, as, one, of, his, most, influential, achievements, in, life, prime, minister, li, si, standardized, the, writing, system, to, be, of, uniform, size, and, shape, across, the, whole, country, this, would, have, a, unifying, effect, on, the, chinese, culture, for, thousands, of, years, he, is, also, credited, with, creating, the, small, seal, script, chinese, pinyin, xi, ozhu, n, style, of, calligraphy, which, serves, as, a, basis, for, modern, chinese, and, is, still, used, in, cards, posters, and, advertising, during, the, warring, states, period, the, hundred, schools, of, thought, comprised, many, different, philosophies, proposed, by, chinese, scholars, contemporary, institutions, descended, in, part, from, the, methods, of, the, mohists, and, school, of, names, 141, 144, confucius, s, school, of, thought, called, confucianism, was, also, influential, beginning, in, the, warring, states, period, and, throughout, the, imperial, periods, beginning, in, the, subsequent, han, dynasty, this, school, of, thought, had, a, so, called, confucian, canon, of, literature, known, as, the, six, classics, the, odes, documents, ritual, music, spring, and, autumn, annals, and, changes, which, embodied, chinese, literature, at, the, time, the, qin, empire, s, laws, were, primarily, administrative, including, penal, law, alongside, li, ritual, comparative, model, manuals, in, the, qin, empire, guided, penal, legal, procedure, and, application, based, on, real, life, situations, with, publicly, named, wrongs, linked, to, punishments, while, some, qin, penal, laws, deal, with, infanticide, or, other, unsanctioned, harm, of, children, it, primarily, concerned, theft, it, does, not, much, deal, with, murder, as, either, more, straightforward, or, more, suitable, to, ritual, by, contrast, detailed, rules, and, endless, paperwork, tightly, regulate, grain, weights, measures, and, official, documents, like, most, ancient, societies, tradition, china, did, not, divide, administration, and, judiciary, but, it, did, include, such, concepts, as, intent, judicial, procedure, defendant, rights, retrial, requests, and, distinctions, between, different, kinds, of, law, common, law, and, statutory, law, the, book, of, lord, shang, prophecies, a, future, sage, of, benevolence, and, righteous, which, the, first, emperor, declares, himself, to, be, regardless, in, the, qin, and, early, han, criminals, may, be, given, amnesties, and, then, only, punished, if, they, did, it, again, penal, law, actually, develops, more, in, the, han, dynasty, the, qin, often, expelled, criminals, to, the, new, colonies, or, pardoned, them, in, exchange, for, fines, labor, or, one, to, several, aristocratic, ranks, even, up, to, the, death, penalty, while, the, penal, laws, would, still, be, considered, harsh, compared, to, the, modern, day, they, were, not, very, harsh, for, their, time, and, often, not, actually, enacted, villainizing, the, first, emperor, while, adopting, qin, administration, a, revulsion, against, the, qin, developed, over, the, course, of, the, han, dynasty, centering, on, shang, yang, and, han, fei, as, espousing, rigorous, law, and, punishment, while, shang, yang, and, maybe, han, fei, may, have, been, influential, in, qin, administration, the, qin, otherwise, abandoned, the, harsh, penal, policy, of, shang, yang, before, its, founding, the, qin, government, was, highly, bureaucratic, and, was, administered, by, a, hierarchy, of, officials, all, serving, the, first, emperor, the, qin, put, into, practice, the, teachings, of, han, feizi, allowing, the, first, emperor, to, control, all, of, his, territories, including, those, recently, conquered, all, aspects, of, life, were, standardized, from, measurements, and, language, to, more, practical, details, such, as, the, length, of, chariot, axles, the, states, made, by, the, emperor, were, assigned, to, officials, dedicated, to, the, task, rather, than, placing, the, burden, on, people, from, the, royal, family, zheng, and, his, advisors, also, introduced, new, laws, and, practices, that, ended, feudalism, in, china, replacing, it, with, a, centralized, bureaucratic, government, a, supervisory, system, the, censorate, was, introduced, to, monitor, and, check, the, powers, of, administrators, and, officials, at, each, level, of, government, the, qin, instituted, a, permanent, system, of, ranks, and, rewards, consisting, of, twenty, ranks, based, on, the, number, of, enemies, killed, in, battle, or, commanding, victorious, units, ranks, were, not, hereditary, unless, a, soldier, died, heroically, in, battle, whereby, the, soldier, s, rank, will, be, inherited, by, his, family, each, rank, was, assigned, a, specified, number, of, dwellings, slaves, and, land, and, ranks, could, be, used, to, remit, judicial, punishments, the, form, of, government, created, by, the, first, emperor, and, his, advisors, was, used, by, later, dynasties, to, structure, their, own, government, under, this, system, both, the, military, and, government, thrived, as, talented, individuals, could, be, more, easily, identified, in, the, transformed, society, later, chinese, dynasties, emulated, the, qin, government, for, its, efficiency, despite, its, being, condemned, by, confucian, philosophy, there, were, instances, of, abuse, however, with, one, example, having, been, recorded, in, the, records, of, officialdom, a, commander, named, hu, ordered, his, men, to, attack, peasants, in, an, attempt, to, increase, the, number, of, bandits, he, had, killed, his, superiors, likely, eager, to, inflate, their, records, as, well, allowed, this, qin, shi, huang, also, improved, the, strong, military, despite, the, fact, that, it, had, already, undergone, extensive, reforms, the, military, used, the, most, advanced, weaponry, of, the, time, it, was, first, used, mostly, in, bronze, form, but, by, the, third, century, bc, kingdoms, such, as, chu, and, qin, were, using, iron, and, or, steel, swords, the, demand, for, this, metal, resulted, in, improved, bellows, the, crossbow, had, been, introduced, in, the, fifth, century, bc, and, was, more, powerful, and, accurate, than, the, composite, bows, used, earlier, it, could, also, be, rendered, ineffective, by, removing, two, pins, which, prevented, enemies, from, capturing, a, working, crossbow, the, qin, also, used, improved, methods, of, transportation, and, tactics, the, state, of, zhao, had, first, replaced, chariots, with, cavalry, in, 307, bc, but, the, change, was, swiftly, adopted, by, the, other, states, because, cavalry, had, greater, mobility, over, the, terrain, of, china, the, first, emperor, developed, plans, to, fortify, his, northern, border, to, protect, against, nomadic, invasions, the, result, was, the, initial, construction, of, what, later, became, the, great,
