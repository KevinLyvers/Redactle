later, became, the, dominant, state, of, hellenistic, greece, the, kingdom, was, founded, and, initially, ruled, by, the, royal, argead, dynasty, which, was, followed, by, the, antipatrid, and, antigonid, dynasties, home, to, the, ancient, macedonians, the, earliest, kingdom, was, centered, on, the, northeastern, part, of, the, greek, peninsula, and, bordered, by, epirus, to, the, southwest, illyria, to, the, northwest, paeonia, to, the, north, thrace, to, the, east, and, thessaly, to, the, south, before, the, 4th, century, bc, macedonia, was, a, small, kingdom, outside, of, the, area, dominated, by, the, great, city, states, of, athens, sparta, and, thebes, and, briefly, subordinate, to, achaemenid, persia, during, the, reign, of, the, argead, king, philip, ii, 359, 336, bc, macedonia, subdued, mainland, greece, and, the, thracian, odrysian, kingdom, through, conquest, and, diplomacy, with, a, reformed, army, containing, phalanxes, wielding, the, sarissa, pike, philip, ii, defeated, the, old, powers, of, athens, and, thebes, in, the, battle, of, chaeronea, in, 338, bc, philip, ii, s, son, alexander, the, great, leading, a, federation, of, greek, states, accomplished, his, father, s, objective, of, commanding, the, whole, of, greece, when, he, destroyed, thebes, after, the, city, revolted, during, alexander, s, subsequent, campaign, of, conquest, he, overthrew, the, achaemenid, empire, and, conquered, territory, that, stretched, as, far, as, the, indus, river, for, a, brief, period, his, macedonian, empire, was, the, most, powerful, in, the, world, the, definitive, hellenistic, state, inaugurating, the, transition, to, a, new, period, of, ancient, greek, civilization, greek, arts, and, literature, flourished, in, the, new, conquered, lands, and, advances, in, philosophy, engineering, and, science, spread, across, the, empire, and, beyond, of, particular, importance, were, the, contributions, of, aristotle, tutor, to, alexander, whose, writings, became, a, keystone, of, western, philosophy, after, alexander, s, death, in, 323, bc, the, ensuing, wars, of, the, diadochi, and, the, partitioning, of, alexander, s, short, lived, empire, macedonia, remained, a, greek, cultural, and, political, center, in, the, mediterranean, region, along, with, ptolemaic, egypt, the, seleucid, empire, and, the, attalid, kingdom, important, cities, such, as, pella, pydna, and, amphipolis, were, involved, in, power, struggles, for, control, of, the, territory, new, cities, were, founded, such, as, thessalonica, by, the, usurper, cassander, named, after, his, wife, thessalonike, of, macedon, macedonia, s, decline, began, with, the, macedonian, wars, and, the, rise, of, rome, as, the, leading, mediterranean, power, at, the, end, of, the, third, macedonian, war, in, 168, bc, the, macedonian, monarchy, was, abolished, and, replaced, by, roman, client, states, a, short, lived, revival, of, the, monarchy, during, the, fourth, macedonian, war, in, 150, 148, bc, ended, with, the, establishment, of, the, roman, province, of, macedonia, the, macedonian, kings, who, wielded, absolute, power, and, commanded, state, resources, such, as, gold, and, silver, facilitated, mining, operations, to, mint, currency, finance, their, armies, and, by, the, reign, of, philip, ii, a, macedonian, navy, unlike, the, other, diadochi, successor, states, the, imperial, cult, fostered, by, alexander, was, never, adopted, in, macedonia, yet, macedonian, rulers, nevertheless, assumed, roles, as, high, priests, of, the, kingdom, and, leading, patrons, of, domestic, and, international, cults, of, the, hellenistic, religion, the, authority, of, macedonian, kings, was, theoretically, limited, by, the, institution, of, the, army, while, a, few, municipalities, within, the, macedonian, commonwealth, enjoyed, a, high, degree, of, autonomy, and, even, had, democratic, governments, with, popular, assemblies, the, name, macedonia, greek, makedon, a, comes, from, the, ethnonym, maked, nes, which, itself, is, derived, from, the, ancient, greek, adjective, makedn, s, meaning, tall, slim, also, the, name, of, a, people, related, to, the, dorians, herodotus, and, possibly, descriptive, of, ancient, macedonians, it, is, most, likely, cognate, with, the, adjective, makros, meaning, long, or, tall, in, ancient, greek, the, name, is, believed, to, have, originally, meant, either, highlanders, the, tall, ones, or, high, grown, men, linguist, robert, s, p, beekes, claims, that, both, terms, are, of, pre, greek, substrate, origin, and, cannot, be, explained, in, terms, of, indo, european, morphology, however, filip, de, decker, rejects, beekes, arguments, as, insufficient, the, classical, greek, historians, herodotus, and, thucydides, reported, the, legend, that, the, macedonian, kings, of, the, argead, dynasty, were, descendants, of, temenus, king, of, argos, and, could, therefore, claim, the, mythical, heracles, as, one, of, their, ancestors, as, well, as, a, direct, lineage, from, zeus, chief, god, of, the, greek, pantheon, contradictory, legends, state, that, either, perdiccas, i, of, macedon, or, caranus, of, macedon, were, the, founders, of, the, argead, dynasty, with, either, five, or, eight, kings, before, amyntas, i, the, assertion, that, the, argeads, descended, from, temenus, was, accepted, by, the, hellanodikai, authorities, of, the, ancient, olympic, games, permitting, alexander, i, of, macedon, r, 498, 454, bc, to, enter, the, competitions, owing, to, his, perceived, greek, heritage, little, is, known, about, the, kingdom, before, the, reign, of, alexander, i, s, father, amyntas, i, of, macedon, r, 547, 498, bc, during, the, archaic, period, the, kingdom, of, macedonia, was, situated, along, the, haliacmon, and, axius, rivers, in, lower, macedonia, north, of, mount, olympus, historian, robert, malcolm, errington, suggests, that, one, of, the, earliest, argead, kings, established, aigai, modern, vergina, as, their, capital, in, the, mid, 7th, century, bc, before, the, 4th, century, bc, the, kingdom, covered, a, region, corresponding, roughly, to, the, western, and, central, parts, of, the, region, of, macedonia, in, modern, greece, it, gradually, expanded, into, the, region, of, upper, macedonia, inhabited, by, the, greek, lyncestae, and, elimiotae, tribes, and, into, regions, of, emathia, eordaia, bottiaea, mygdonia, crestonia, and, almopia, which, were, inhabited, by, various, peoples, such, as, thracians, and, phrygians, macedonia, s, non, greek, neighbors, included, thracians, inhabiting, territories, to, the, northeast, illyrians, to, the, northwest, and, paeonians, to, the, north, while, the, lands, of, thessaly, to, the, south, and, epirus, to, the, west, were, inhabited, by, greeks, with, similar, cultures, to, that, of, the, macedonians, a, year, after, darius, i, of, persia, r, 522, 486, bc, launched, an, invasion, into, europe, against, the, scythians, paeonians, thracians, and, several, greek, city, states, of, the, balkans, the, persian, general, megabazus, used, diplomacy, to, convince, amyntas, i, to, submit, as, a, vassal, of, the, achaemenid, empire, ushering, in, the, period, of, achaemenid, macedonia, achaemenid, persian, hegemony, over, macedonia, was, briefly, interrupted, by, the, ionian, revolt, 499, 493, bc, yet, the, persian, general, mardonius, brought, it, back, under, achaemenid, suzerainty, although, macedonia, enjoyed, a, large, degree, of, autonomy, and, was, never, made, a, satrapy, i, e, province, of, the, achaemenid, empire, it, was, expected, to, provide, troops, for, the, achaemenid, army, alexander, i, provided, macedonian, military, support, to, xerxes, i, r, 486, 465, bc, during, the, second, persian, invasion, of, greece, in, 480, 479, bc, and, macedonian, soldiers, fought, on, the, side, of, the, persians, at, the, 479, bc, battle, of, platea, following, the, greek, victory, at, salamis, in, 480, bc, alexander, i, was, employed, as, an, achaemenid, diplomat, to, propose, a, peace, treaty, and, alliance, with, athens, an, offer, that, was, rejected, soon, afterwards, the, achaemenid, forces, were, forced, to, withdraw, from, mainland, europe, marking, the, end, of, persian, control, over, macedonia, although, initially, a, persian, vassal, alexander, i, of, macedon, fostered, friendly, diplomatic, relations, with, his, former, greek, enemies, the, athenian, and, spartan, led, coalition, of, greek, city, states, his, successor, perdiccas, ii, r, 454, 413, bc, led, the, macedonians, to, war, in, four, separate, conflicts, against, athens, leader, of, the, delian, league, while, incursions, by, the, thracian, ruler, sitalces, of, the, odrysian, kingdom, threatened, macedonia, s, territorial, integrity, in, the, northeast, the, athenian, statesman, pericles, promoted, colonization, of, the, strymon, river, near, the, kingdom, of, macedonia, where, the, colonial, city, of, amphipolis, was, founded, in, 437, 436, bc, so, that, it, could, provide, athens, with, a, steady, supply, of, silver, and, gold, as, well, as, timber, and, pitch, to, support, the, athenian, navy, initially, perdiccas, ii, did, not, take, any, action, and, might, have, even, welcomed, the, athenians, as, the, thracians, were, foes, to, both, of, them, this, changed, due, to, an, athenian, alliance, with, a, brother, and, cousin, of, perdiccas, ii, who, had, rebelled, against, him, thus, two, separate, wars, were, fought, against, athens, between, 433, and, 431, bc, the, macedonian, king, retaliated, by, promoting, the, rebellion, of, athens, allies, in, chalcidice, and, subsequently, won, over, the, strategic, city, of, potidaea, after, capturing, the, macedonian, cities, therma, and, beroea, athens, besieged, potidaea, but, failed, to, overcome, it, therma, was, returned, to, macedonia, and, much, of, chalcidice, to, athens, in, a, peace, treaty, brokered, by, sitalces, who, provided, athens, with, military, aid, in, exchange, for, acquiring, new, thracian, allies, perdiccas, ii, sided, with, sparta, in, the, peloponnesian, war, 431, 404, bc, between, athens, and, sparta, and, in, 429, bc, athens, retaliated, by, persuading, sitalces, to, invade, macedonia, but, he, was, forced, to, retreat, owing, to, a, shortage, of, provisions, in, winter, in, 424, bc, arrhabaeus, a, local, ruler, of, lynkestis, in, upper, macedonia, rebelled, against, his, overlord, perdiccas, and, the, spartans, agreed, to, help, in, putting, down, the, revolt, at, the, battle, of, lyncestis, the, macedonians, panicked, and, fled, before, the, fighting, began, enraging, the, spartan, general, brasidas, whose, soldiers, looted, the, unattended, macedonian, baggage, train, perdiccas, then, changed, sides, and, supported, athens, and, he, was, able, to, put, down, arrhabaeus, s, revolt, brasidas, died, in, 422, bc, the, year, athens, and, sparta, struck, an, accord, the, peace, of, nicias, that, freed, macedonia, from, its, obligations, as, an, athenian, ally, following, the, 418, bc, battle, of, mantinea, the, victorious, spartans, formed, an, alliance, with, argos, a, military, pact, perdiccas, ii, was, keen, to, join, given, the, threat, of, spartan, allies, remaining, in, chalcidice, when, argos, suddenly, switched, sides, as, a, pro, athenian, democracy, the, athenian, navy, was, able, to, form, a, blockade, against, macedonian, seaports, and, invade, chalcidice, in, 417, bc, perdiccas, ii, sued, for, peace, in, 414, bc, forming, an, alliance, with, athens, that, was, continued, by, his, son, and, successor, archelaus, i, r, 413, 399, bc, athens, then, provided, naval, support, to, archelaus, i, in, the, 410, bc, macedonian, siege, of, pydna, in, exchange, for, timber, and, naval, equipment, although, archelaus, i, was, faced, with, some, internal, revolts, and, had, to, fend, off, an, invasion, of, illyrians, led, by, sirras, of, lynkestis, he, was, able, to, project, macedonian, power, into, thessaly, where, he, sent, military, aid, to, his, allies, although, he, retained, aigai, as, a, ceremonial, and, religious, center, archelaus, i, moved, the, capital, of, the, kingdom, north, to, pella, which, was, then, positioned, by, a, lake, with, a, river, connecting, it, to, the, aegean, sea, he, improved, macedonia, s, currency, by, minting, coins, with, a, higher, silver, content, as, well, as, issuing, separate, copper, coinage, his, royal, court, attracted, the, presence, of, well, known, intellectuals, such, as, the, athenian, playwright, euripides, when, archelaus, i, was, assassinated, perhaps, following, a, homosexual, love, affair, with, royal, pages, at, his, court, the, kingdom, was, plunged, into, chaos, in, an, era, lasting, from, 399, to, 393, bc, that, included, the, reign, of, four, different, monarchs, orestes, son, of, archelaus, i, aeropus, ii, uncle, regent, and, murderer, of, orestes, pausanias, son, of, aeropus, ii, and, amyntas, ii, who, was, married, to, the, youngest, daughter, of, archelaus, i, very, little, is, known, about, this, turbulent, period, it, came, to, an, end, when, amyntas, iii, r, 393, 370, bc, son, of, arrhidaeus, and, grandson, of, amyntas, i, killed, pausanias, and, claimed, the, macedonian, throne, amyntas, iii, was, forced, to, flee, his, kingdom, in, either, 393, or, 383, bc, based, on, conflicting, accounts, owing, to, a, massive, invasion, by, the, illyrians, led, by, bardylis, the, pretender, to, the, throne, argaeus, ruled, in, his, absence, yet, amyntas, iii, eventually, returned, to, his, kingdom, with, the, aid, of, thessalian, allies, amyntas, iii, was, also, nearly, overthrown, by, the, forces, of, the, chalcidian, city, of, olynthos, but, with, the, aid, of, teleutias, brother, of, the, spartan, king, agesilaus, ii, the, macedonians, forced, olynthos, to, surrender, and, dissolve, their, chalcidian, league, in, 379, bc, alexander, ii, r, 370, 368, bc, son, of, eurydice, i, and, amyntas, iii, succeeded, his, father, and, immediately, invaded, thessaly, to, wage, war, against, the, tagus, supreme, thessalian, military, leader, alexander, of, pherae, capturing, the, city, of, larissa, the, thessalians, desiring, to, remove, both, alexander, ii, and, alexander, of, pherae, as, their, overlords, appealed, to, pelopidas, of, thebes, for, aid, he, succeeded, in, recapturing, larissa, and, in, the, peace, agreement, arranged, with, macedonia, received, aristocratic, hostages, including, alexander, ii, s, brother, and, future, king, philip, ii, r, 359, 336, bc, when, alexander, was, assassinated, by, his, brother, in, law, ptolemy, of, aloros, the, latter, acted, as, an, overbearing, regent, for, perdiccas, iii, r, 368, 359, bc, younger, brother, of, alexander, ii, who, eventually, had, ptolemy, executed, when, reaching, the, age, of, majority, in, 365, bc, the, remainder, of, perdiccas, iii, s, reign, was, marked, by, political, stability, and, financial, recovery, however, an, athenian, invasion, led, by, timotheus, son, of, conon, managed, to, capture, methone, and, pydna, and, an, illyrian, invasion, led, by, bardylis, succeeded, in, killing, perdiccas, iii, and, 4, 000, macedonian, troops, in, battle, philip, ii, was, twenty, four, years, old, when, he, acceded, to, the, throne, in, 359, bc, through, the, use, of, deft, diplomacy, he, was, able, to, convince, the, thracians, under, berisades, to, cease, their, support, of, pausanias, a, pretender, to, the, throne, and, the, athenians, to, halt, their, support, of, another, pretender, he, achieved, these, by, bribing, the, thracians, and, their, paeonian, allies, and, establishing, a, treaty, with, athens, that, relinquished, his, claims, to, amphipolis, he, was, also, able, to, make, peace, with, the, illyrians, who, had, threatened, his, borders, philip, ii, spent, his, initial, years, radically, transforming, the, macedonian, army, a, reform, of, its, organization, equipment, and, training, including, the, introduction, of, the, macedonian, phalanx, armed, with, long, pikes, i, e, the, sarissa, proved, immediately, successful, when, tested, against, his, illyrian, and, paeonian, enemies, confusing, accounts, in, ancient, sources, have, led, modern, scholars, to, debate, how, much, philip, ii, s, royal, predecessors, may, have, contributed, to, these, reforms, and, the, extent, to, which, his, ideas, were, influenced, by, his, adolescent, years, of, captivity, in, thebes, as, a, political, hostage, during, the, theban, hegemony, especially, after, meeting, with, the, general, epaminondas, the, macedonians, like, the, other, greeks, traditionally, practiced, monogamy, but, philip, ii, practiced, polygamy, and, married, seven, wives, with, perhaps, only, one, that, did, not, involve, the, loyalty, of, his, aristocratic, subjects, or, new, allies, his, first, marriages, were, to, phila, of, elimeia, of, the, upper, macedonian, aristocracy, as, well, as, the, illyrian, princess, audata, to, ensure, a, marriage, alliance, to, establish, an, alliance, with, larissa, in, thessaly, he, married, the, thessalian, noblewoman, philinna, in, 358, bc, who, bore, him, a, son, who, would, later, rule, as, philip, iii, arrhidaeus, r, 323, 317, bc, in, 357, bc, he, married, olympias, to, secure, an, alliance, with, arybbas, the, king, of, epirus, and, the, molossians, this, marriage, would, bear, a, son, who, would, later, rule, as, alexander, iii, better, known, as, alexander, the, great, and, claim, descent, from, the, legendary, achilles, by, way, of, his, dynastic, heritage, from, epirus, it, is, unclear, whether, or, not, the, achaemenid, persian, kings, influenced, philip, ii, s, practice, of, polygamy, although, his, predecessor, amyntas, iii, had, three, sons, with, a, possible, second, wife, gygaea, archelaus, arrhidaeus, and, menelaus, philip, ii, had, archelaus, put, to, death, in, 359, bc, while, philip, ii, s, other, two, half, brothers, fled, to, olynthos, serving, as, a, casus, belli, for, the, olynthian, war, 349, 348, bc, against, the, chalcidian, league, while, athens, was, preoccupied, with, the, social, war, 357, 355, bc, philip, ii, retook, amphipolis, from, them, in, 357, bc, and, the, following, year, recaptured, pydna, and, potidaea, the, latter, of, which, he, handed, over, to, the, chalcidian, league, as, promised, in, a, treaty, in, 356, bc, he, took, crenides, refounding, it, as, philippi, while, his, general, parmenion, defeated, the, illyrian, king, grabos, ii, of, the, grabaei, during, the, 355, 354, bc, siege, of, methone, philip, ii, lost, his, right, eye, to, an, arrow, wound, but, managed, to, capture, the, city, and, treated, the, inhabitants, cordially, unlike, the, potidaeans, who, had, been, enslaved, philip, ii, then, involved, macedonia, in, the, third, sacred, war, 356, 346, bc, it, began, when, phocis, captured, and, plundered, the, temple, of, apollo, at, delphi, instead, of, submitting, unpaid, fines, causing, the, amphictyonic, league, to, declare, war, on, phocis, and, a, civil, war, among, the, members, of, the, thessalian, league, aligned, with, either, phocis, or, thebes, philip, ii, s, initial, campaign, against, pherae, in, thessaly, in, 353, bc, at, the, behest, of, larissa, ended, in, two, disastrous, defeats, by, the, phocian, general, onomarchus, philip, ii, in, turn, defeated, onomarchus, in, 352, bc, at, the, battle, of, crocus, field, which, led, to, philip, ii, s, election, as, leader, archon, of, the, thessalian, league, provided, him, a, seat, on, the, amphictyonic, council, and, allowed, for, a, marriage, alliance, with, pherae, by, wedding, nicesipolis, niece, of, the, tyrant, jason, of, pherae, philip, ii, had, some, early, involvement, with, the, achaemenid, empire, especially, by, supporting, satraps, and, mercenaries, who, rebelled, against, the, central, authority, of, the, achaemenid, king, the, satrap, of, hellespontine, phrygia, artabazos, ii, who, was, in, rebellion, against, artaxerxes, iii, was, able, to, take, refuge, as, an, exile, at, the, macedonian, court, from, 352, to, 342, bc, he, was, accompanied, in, exile, by, his, family, and, by, his, mercenary, general, memnon, of, rhodes, barsine, daughter, of, artabazos, and, future, wife, of, alexander, the, great, grew, up, at, the, macedonian, court, after, campaigning, against, the, thracian, ruler, cersobleptes, in, 349, bc, philip, ii, began, his, war, against, the, chalcidian, league, which, had, been, reestablished, in, 375, bc, following, a, temporary, disbandment, despite, an, athenian, intervention, by, charidemus, olynthos, was, captured, by, philip, ii, in, 348, bc, and, its, inhabitants, were, sold, into, slavery, including, some, athenian, citizens, the, athenians, especially, in, a, series, of, speeches, by, demosthenes, known, as, the, olynthiacs, were, unsuccessful, in, persuading, their, allies, to, counterattack, and, in, 346, bc, concluded, a, treaty, with, macedonia, known, as, the, peace, of, philocrates, the, treaty, stipulated, that, athens, would, relinquish, claims, to, macedonian, coastal, territories, the, chalcidice, and, amphipolis, in, return, for, the, release, of, the, enslaved, athenians, as, well, as, guarantees, that, philip, ii, would, not, attack, athenian, settlements, in, the, thracian, chersonese, meanwhile, phocis, and, thermopylae, were, captured, by, macedonian, forces, the, delphic, temple, robbers, were, executed, and, philip, ii, was, awarded, the, two, phocian, seats, on, the, amphictyonic, council, and, the, position, of, master, of, ceremonies, over, the, pythian, games, athens, initially, opposed, his, membership, on, the, council, and, refused, to, attend, the, games, in, protest, but, they, eventually, accepted, these, conditions, perhaps, after, some, persuasion, by, demosthenes, in, his, oration, on, the, peace, over, the, next, few, years, philip, ii, reformed, local, governments, in, thessaly, campaigned, against, the, illyrian, ruler, pleuratus, i, deposed, arybbas, in, epirus, in, favor, of, his, brother, in, law, alexander, i, through, philip, ii, s, marriage, to, olympias, and, defeated, cersebleptes, in, thrace, this, allowed, him, to, extend, macedonian, control, over, the, hellespont, in, anticipation, of, an, invasion, into, achaemenid, anatolia, in, 342, bc, philip, ii, conquered, a, thracian, city, in, what, is, now, bulgaria, and, renamed, it, philippopolis, modern, plovdiv, war, broke, out, with, athens, in, 340, bc, while, philip, ii, was, engaged, in, two, ultimately, unsuccessful, sieges, of, perinthus, and, byzantion, followed, by, a, successful, campaign, against, the, scythians, along, the, danube, and, macedonia, s, involvement, in, the, fourth, sacred, war, against, amphissa, in, 339, bc, thebes, ejected, a, macedonian, garrison, from, nicaea, near, thermopylae, leading, thebes, to, join, athens, megara, corinth, achaea, and, euboea, in, a, final, confrontation, against, macedonia, at, the, battle, of, chaeronea, in, 338, bc, after, the, macedonian, victory, at, chaeronea, philip, ii, installed, an, oligarchy, in, thebes, yet, was, lenient, toward, athens, wishing, to, utilize, their, navy, in, a, planned, invasion, of, the, achaemenid, empire, he, was, then, chiefly, responsible, for, the, formation, of, the, league, of, corinth, that, included, the, major, greek, city, states, except, sparta, despite, the, kingdom, of, macedonia, s, official, exclusion, from, the, league, in, 337, bc, philip, ii, was, elected, as, the, leader, hegemon, of, its, council, synedrion, and, the, commander, in, chief, strategos, autokrator, of, a, forthcoming, campaign, to, invade, the, achaemenid, empire, philip, s, plan, to, punish, the, persians, for, the, suffering, of, the, greeks, and, to, liberate, the, greek, cities, of, asia, minor, as, well, as, perhaps, the, panhellenic, fear, of, another, persian, invasion, of, greece, contributed, to, his, decision, to, invade, the, achaemenid, empire, the, persians, offered, aid, to, perinthus, and, byzantion, in, 341, 340, bc, highlighting, macedonia, s, strategic, need, to, secure, thrace, and, the, aegean, sea, against, increasing, achaemenid, encroachment, as, the, persian, king, artaxerxes, iii, further, consolidated, his, control, over, satrapies, in, western, anatolia, the, latter, region, yielding, far, more, wealth, and, valuable, resources, than, the, balkans, was, also, coveted, by, the, macedonian, king, for, its, sheer, economic, potential, when, philip, ii, married, cleopatra, eurydice, niece, of, general, attalus, talk, of, providing, new, potential, heirs, at, the, wedding, feast, infuriated, philip, ii, s, son, alexander, a, veteran, of, the, battle, of, chaeronea, and, his, mother, olympias, they, fled, together, to, epirus, before, alexander, was, recalled, to, pella, by, philip, ii, when, philip, ii, arranged, a, marriage, between, his, son, arrhidaeus, and, ada, of, caria, daughter, of, pixodarus, the, persian, satrap, of, caria, alexander, intervened, and, proposed, to, marry, ada, instead, philip, ii, then, cancelled, the, wedding, altogether, and, exiled, alexander, s, advisors, ptolemy, nearchus, and, harpalus, to, reconcile, with, olympias, philip, ii, had, their, daughter, cleopatra, marry, olympias, brother, and, cleopatra, s, uncle, alexander, i, of, epirus, but, philip, ii, was, assassinated, by, his, bodyguard, pausanias, of, orestis, during, their, wedding, feast, and, succeeded, by, alexander, in, 336, bc, modern, scholars, have, argued, over, the, possible, role, of, alexander, iii, the, great, and, his, mother, olympias, in, the, assassination, of, philip, ii, noting, the, latter, s, choice, to, exclude, alexander, from, his, planned, invasion, of, asia, choosing, instead, for, him, to, act, as, regent, of, greece, and, deputy, hegemon, of, the, league, of, corinth, and, the, potential, bearing, of, another, male, heir, between, philip, ii, and, his, new, wife, cleopatra, eurydice, alexander, iii, r, 336, 323, bc, was, immediately, proclaimed, king, by, an, assembly, of, the, army, and, leading, aristocrats, chief, among, them, being, antipater, and, parmenion, by, the, end, of, his, reign, and, military, career, in, 323, bc, alexander, would, rule, over, an, empire, consisting, of, mainland, greece, asia, minor, the, levant, ancient, egypt, mesopotamia, persia, and, much, of, central, and, south, asia, i, e, modern, pakistan, among, his, first, acts, was, the, burial, of, his, father, at, aigai, the, members, of, the, league, of, corinth, revolted, at, the, news, of, philip, ii, s, death, but, were, soon, quelled, by, military, force, alongside, persuasive, diplomacy, electing, alexander, as, hegemon, of, the, league, to, carry, out, the, planned, invasion, of, achaemenid, persia, in, 335, bc, alexander, fought, against, the, thracian, tribe, of, the, triballi, at, haemus, mons, and, along, the, danube, forcing, their, surrender, on, peuce, island, shortly, thereafter, the, illyrian, chieftain, cleitus, son, of, bardylis, threatened, to, attack, macedonia, with, the, aid, of, glaucias, king, of, the, taulantii, but, alexander, took, the, initiative, and, besieged, the, illyrians, at, pelion, in, modern, albania, when, thebes, had, once, again, revolted, from, the, league, of, corinth, and, was, besieging, the, macedonian, garrison, in, the, cadmea, alexander, left, the, illyrian, front, and, marched, to, thebes, which, he, placed, under, siege, after, breaching, the, walls, alexander, s, forces, killed, 6, 000, thebans, took, 30, 000, inhabitants, as, prisoners, of, war, and, burned, the, city, to, the, ground, as, a, warning, that, convinced, all, other, greek, states, except, sparta, not, to, challenge, alexander, again, throughout, his, military, career, alexander, won, every, battle, that, he, personally, commanded, his, first, victory, against, the, persians, in, asia, minor, at, the, battle, of, the, granicus, in, 334, bc, used, a, small, cavalry, contingent, as, a, distraction, to, allow, his, infantry, to, cross, the, river, followed, by, a, cavalry, charge, from, his, companion, cavalry, alexander, led, the, cavalry, charge, at, the, battle, of, issus, in, 333, bc, forcing, the, persian, king, darius, iii, and, his, army, to, flee, darius, iii, despite, having, superior, numbers, was, again, forced, to, flee, the, battle, of, gaugamela, in, 331, bc, the, persian, king, was, later, captured, and, executed, by, his, own, satrap, of, bactria, and, kinsman, bessus, in, 330, bc, the, macedonian, king, subsequently, hunted, down, and, executed, bessus, in, what, is, now, afghanistan, securing, the, region, of, sogdia, in, the, process, at, the, 326, bc, battle, of, the, hydaspes, modern, day, punjab, when, the, war, elephants, of, king, porus, of, the, pauravas, threatened, alexander, s, troops, he, had, them, form, open, ranks, to, surround, the, elephants, and, dislodge, their, handlers, by, using, their, sarissa, pikes, when, his, macedonian, troops, threatened, mutiny, in, 324, bc, at, opis, babylonia, near, modern, baghdad, iraq, alexander, offered, macedonian, military, titles, and, greater, responsibilities, to, persian, officers, and, units, instead, forcing, his, troops, to, seek, forgiveness, at, a, staged, banquet, of, reconciliation, between, persians, and, macedonians, alexander, perhaps, undercut, his, own, rule, by, demonstrating, signs, of, megalomania, while, utilizing, effective, propaganda, such, as, the, cutting, of, the, gordian, knot, he, also, attempted, to, portray, himself, as, a, living, god, and, son, of, zeus, following, his, visit, to, the, oracle, at, siwah, in, the, libyan, desert, in, modern, day, egypt, in, 331, bc, his, attempt, in, 327, bc, to, have, his, men, prostrate, before, him, in, bactra, in, an, act, of, proskynesis, borrowed, from, the, persian, kings, was, rejected, as, religious, blasphemy, by, his, macedonian, and, greek, subjects, after, his, court, historian, callisthenes, refused, to, perform, this, ritual, when, alexander, had, parmenion, murdered, at, ecbatana, near, modern, hamadan, iran, in, 330, bc, this, was, symptomatic, of, the, growing, gulf, between, the, king, s, interests, and, those, of, his, country, and, people, according, to, errington, his, murder, of, cleitus, the, black, in, 328, bc, is, described, as, vengeful, and, reckless, by, dawn, l, gilley, and, ian, worthington, continuing, the, polygamous, habits, of, his, father, alexander, encouraged, his, men, to, marry, native, women, in, asia, leading, by, example, when, he, wed, roxana, a, sogdian, princess, of, bactria, he, then, married, stateira, ii, eldest, daughter, of, darius, iii, and, parysatis, ii, youngest, daughter, of, artaxerxes, iii, at, the, susa, weddings, in, 324, bc, meanwhile, in, greece, the, spartan, king, agis, iii, attempted, to, lead, a, rebellion, of, the, greeks, against, macedonia, he, was, defeated, in, 331, bc, at, the, battle, of, megalopolis, by, antipater, who, was, serving, as, regent, of, macedonia, and, deputy, hegemon, of, the, league, of, corinth, in, alexander, s, stead, before, antipater, embarked, on, his, campaign, in, the, peloponnese, memnon, the, governor, of, thrace, was, dissuaded, from, rebellion, by, use, of, diplomacy, antipater, deferred, the, punishment, of, sparta, to, the, league, of, corinth, headed, by, alexander, who, ultimately, pardoned, the, spartans, on, the, condition, that, they, submit, fifty, nobles, as, hostages, antipater, s, hegemony, was, somewhat, unpopular, in, greece, due, to, his, practice, perhaps, by, order, of, alexander, of, exiling, malcontents, and, garrisoning, cities, with, macedonian, troops, yet, in, 330, bc, alexander, declared, that, the, tyrannies, installed, in, greece, were, to, be, abolished, and, greek, freedom, was, to, be, restored, when, alexander, the, great, died, at, babylon, in, 323, bc, his, mother, olympias, immediately, accused, antipater, and, his, faction, of, poisoning, him, although, there, is, no, evidence, to, confirm, this, with, no, official, heir, apparent, the, macedonian, military, command, split, with, one, side, proclaiming, alexander, s, half, brother, philip, iii, arrhidaeus, r, 323, 317, bc, as, king, and, the, other, siding, with, the, infant, son, of, alexander, and, roxana, alexander, iv, r, 323, 309, bc, except, for, the, euboeans, and, boeotians, the, greeks, also, immediately, rose, up, in, a, rebellion, against, antipater, known, as, the, lamian, war, 323, 322, bc, when, antipater, was, defeated, at, the, 323, bc, battle, of, thermopylae, he, fled, to, lamia, where, he, was, besieged, by, the, athenian, commander, leosthenes, a, macedonian, army, led, by, leonnatus, rescued, antipater, by, lifting, the, siege, antipater, defeated, the, rebellion, yet, his, death, in, 319, bc, left, a, power, vacuum, wherein, the, two, proclaimed, kings, of, macedonia, became, pawns, in, a, power, struggle, between, the, diadochi, the, former, generals, of, alexander, s, army, a, council, of, the, army, convened, in, babylon, immediately, after, alexander, s, death, naming, philip, iii, as, king, and, the, chiliarch, perdiccas, as, his, regent, antipater, antigonus, monophthalmus, craterus, and, ptolemy, formed, a, coalition, against, perdiccas, in, a, civil, war, initiated, by, ptolemy, s, seizure, of, the, hearse, of, alexander, the, great, perdiccas, was, assassinated, in, 321, bc, by, his, own, officers, during, a, failed, campaign, in, egypt, against, ptolemy, where, his, march, along, the, nile, river, resulted, in, the, drowning, of, 2, 000, of, his, men, although, eumenes, of, cardia, managed, to, kill, craterus, in, battle, this, had, little, to, no, effect, on, the, outcome, of, the, 321, bc, partition, of, triparadisus, in, syria, where, the, victorious, coalition, settled, the, issue, of, a, new, regency, and, territorial, rights, antipater, was, appointed, as, regent, over, the, two, kings, before, antipater, died, in, 319, bc, he, named, the, staunch, argead, loyalist, polyperchon, as, his, successor, passing, over, his, own, son, cassander, and, ignoring, the, right, of, the, king, to, choose, a, new, regent, since, philip, iii, was, considered, mentally, unstable, in, effect, bypassing, the, council, of, the, army, as, well, forming, an, alliance, with, ptolemy, antigonus, and, lysimachus, cassander, had, his, officer, nicanor, capture, the, munichia, fortress, of, athens, port, town, piraeus, in, defiance, of, polyperchon, s, decree, that, greek, cities, should, be, free, of, macedonian, garrisons, sparking, the, second, war, of, the, diadochi, 319, 315, bc, given, a, string, of, military, failures, by, polyperchon, in, 317, bc, philip, iii, by, way, of, his, politically, engaged, wife, eurydice, ii, of, macedon, officially, replaced, him, as, regent, with, cassander, afterwards, polyperchon, desperately, sought, the, aid, of, olympias, in, epirus, a, joint, force, of, epirotes, aetolians, and, polyperchon, s, troops, invaded, macedonia, and, forced, the, surrender, of, philip, iii, and, eurydice, s, army, allowing, olympias, to, execute, the, king, and, force, his, queen, to, commit, suicide, olympias, then, had, nicanor, and, dozens, of, other, macedonian, nobles, killed, but, by, the, spring, of, 316, bc, cassander, had, defeated, her, forces, captured, her, and, placed, her, on, trial, for, murder, before, sentencing, her, to, death, cassander, married, philip, ii, s, daughter, thessalonike, and, briefly, extended, macedonian, control, into, illyria, as, far, as, epidamnos, modern, durr, s, albania, by, 313, bc, it, was, retaken, by, the, illyrian, king, glaucias, of, taulantii, by, 316, bc, antigonus, had, taken, the, territory, of, eumenes, and, managed, to, eject, seleucus, nicator, from, his, babylonian, satrapy, leading, cassander, ptolemy, and, lysimachus, to, issue, a, joint, ultimatum, to, antigonus, in, 315, bc, for, him, to, surrender, various, territories, in, asia, antigonus, promptly, allied, with, polyperchon, now, based, in, corinth, and, issued, an, ultimatum, of, his, own, to, cassander, charging, him, with, murder, for, executing, olympias, and, demanding, that, he, hand, over, the, royal, family, king, alexander, iv, and, the, queen, mother, roxana, the, conflict, that, followed, lasted, until, the, winter, of, 312, 311, bc, when, a, new, peace, settlement, recognized, cassander, as, general, of, europe, antigonus, as, first, in, asia, ptolemy, as, general, of, egypt, and, lysimachus, as, general, of, thrace, cassander, had, alexander, iv, and, roxana, put, to, death, in, the, winter, of, 311, 310, bc, and, between, 306, and, 305, bc, the, diadochi, were, declared, kings, of, their, respective, territories, the, beginning, of, hellenistic, greece, was, defined, by, the, struggle, between, the, antipatrid, dynasty, led, first, by, cassander, r, 305, 297, bc, son, of, antipater, and, the, antigonid, dynasty, led, by, the, macedonian, general, antigonus, i, monophthalmus, r, 306, 301, bc, and, his, son, the, future, king, demetrius, i, r, 294, 288, bc, cassander, besieged, athens, in, 303, bc, but, was, forced, to, retreat, to, macedonia, when, demetrius, invaded, boeotia, to, his, rear, attempting, to, sever, his, path, of, retreat, while, antigonus, and, demetrius, attempted, to, recreate, philip, ii, s, hellenic, league, with, themselves, as, dual, hegemons, a, revived, coalition, of, cassander, ptolemy, i, soter, r, 305, 283, bc, of, egypt, s, ptolemaic, dynasty, seleucus, i, nicator, r, 305,

into, flight, cassander, died, in, 297, bc, and, his, sickly, son, philip, iv, died, the, same, year, succeeded, by, cassander, s, other, sons, alexander, v, of, macedon, r, 297, 294, bc, and, antipater, ii, of, macedon, r, 297, 294, bc, with, their, mother, thessalonike, of, macedon, acting, as, regent, while, demetrius, fought, against, the, antipatrid, forces, in, greece, antipater, ii, killed, his, own, mother, to, obtain, power, his, desperate, brother, alexander, v, then, requested, aid, from, pyrrhus, of, epirus, r, 297, 272, bc, who, had, fought, alongside, demetrius, at, the, battle, of, ipsus, but, was, sent, to, egypt, as, a, hostage, as, part, of, an, agreement, between, demetrius, and, ptolemy, i, in, exchange, for, defeating, the, forces, of, antipater, ii, and, forcing, him, to, flee, to, the, court, of, lysimachus, in, thrace, pyrrhus, was, awarded, the, westernmost, portions, of, the, macedonian, kingdom, demetrius, had, his, nephew, alexander, v, assassinated, and, was, then, proclaimed, king, of, macedonia, but, his, subjects, protested, against, his, aloof, eastern, style, autocracy, war, broke, out, between, pyrrhus, and, demetrius, in, 290, bc, when, lanassa, wife, of, pyrrhus, daughter, of, agathocles, of, syracuse, left, him, for, demetrius, and, offered, him, her, dowry, of, corcyra, the, war, dragged, on, until, 288, bc, when, demetrius, lost, the, support, of, the, macedonians, and, fled, the, country, macedonia, was, then, divided, between, pyrrhus, and, lysimachus, the, former, taking, western, macedonia, and, the, latter, eastern, macedonia, by, 286, bc, lysimachus, had, expelled, pyrrhus, and, his, forces, from, macedonia, in, 282, bc, a, new, war, erupted, between, seleucus, i, and, lysimachus, the, latter, was, killed, in, the, battle, of, corupedion, allowing, seleucus, i, to, take, control, of, thrace, and, macedonia, in, two, dramatic, reversals, of, fortune, seleucus, i, was, assassinated, in, 281, bc, by, his, officer, ptolemy, keraunos, son, of, ptolemy, i, and, grandson, of, antipater, who, was, then, proclaimed, king, of, macedonia, before, being, killed, in, battle, in, 279, bc, by, celtic, invaders, in, the, gallic, invasion, of, greece, the, macedonian, army, proclaimed, the, general, sosthenes, of, macedon, as, king, although, he, apparently, refused, the, title, after, defeating, the, gallic, ruler, bolgios, and, driving, out, the, raiding, party, of, brennus, sosthenes, died, and, left, a, chaotic, situation, in, macedonia, the, gallic, invaders, ravaged, macedonia, until,

in, 275, bc, after, the, ultimate, failure, of, both, campaigns, which, contributed, to, the, rise, of, rome, because, greek, cities, in, southern, italy, such, as, tarentum, now, became, roman, allies, pyrrhus, invaded, macedonia, in, 274, bc, defeating, the, largely, mercenary, army, of, antigonus, ii, at, the, 274, bc, battle, of, aous, and, driving, him, out, of, macedonia, forcing, him,

bc, allowing, antigonus, ii, to, reclaim, the, rest, of, greece, he, then, restored, the, argead, dynastic, graves, at, aigai, and, annexed, the, kingdom, of, paeonia, the, aetolian, league, hampered, antigonus, ii, s, control, over, central, greece, and, the, formation, of, the, achaean, league, in, 251, bc, pushed, macedonian, forces, out, of, much, of, the, peloponnese, and, at, times, incorporated, athens, and, sparta, while, the, seleucid, empire, aligned, with, antigonid, macedonia, against, ptolemaic, egypt, during, the, syrian, wars, the, ptolemaic, navy, heavily, disrupted,

demetrius, ii, accepted, her, proposal, but, he, damaged, relations, with, the, seleucids, by, divorcing, stratonice, of, macedon, although, the, aetolians, formed, an, alliance, with, the, achaean, league, as, a, result, demetrius, ii, was, able, to, invade, boeotia, and, capture, it, from, the, aetolians, by, 236, bc, the, achaean, league, managed, to, capture, megalopolis, in, 235, bc, and, by, the, end, of, demetrius, ii, s, reign, most, of, the, peloponnese, except, argos, was, taken, from, the, macedonians, demetrius, ii, also, lost, an, ally, in, epirus, when, the, monarchy, was, toppled, in, a, republican, revolution, demetrius, ii, enlisted, the, aid, of, the, illyrian, king, agron, to, defend, acarnania, against, aetolia, and, in, 229, bc, they, managed, to, defeat, the,

greece, in, the, cleomenean, war, 229, 222, bc, in, exchange, for, military, aid, antigonus, iii, demanded, the, return, of, corinth, to, macedonian, control, which, aratus, finally, agreed, to, in, 225, bc, in, 224, bc, antigonus, iii, s, forces, took, arcadia, from, sparta, after, forming, a, hellenic, league, in, the, same, vein, as, philip, ii, s, league, of, corinth, he, managed, to, defeat,

faced, immediate, challenges, to, his, authority, by, the, illyrian, dardani, and, aetolian, league, philip, v, and, his, allies, were, successful, against, the, aetolians, and, their, allies, in, the, social, war, 220, 217, bc, yet, he, made, peace, with, the, aetolians, once, he, heard, of, incursions, by, the, dardani, in, the, north, and, the, carthaginian, victory, over, the, romans, at, the, battle, of, lake, trasimene, in, 217, bc, demetrius, of, pharos, is, alleged, to, have, convinced, philip, v, to, first, secure, illyria, in, advance, of, an, invasion, of, the, italian, peninsula, in, 216, bc, philip, v, sent, a, hundred, light, warships, into, the, adriatic, sea, to, attack, illyria, a, move, that, prompted, scerdilaidas, of, the, ardiaean, kingdom, to, appeal, to, the, romans, for, aid, rome, responded, by, sending, ten, heavy, quinqueremes, from, roman, sicily, to, patrol, the, illyrian, coasts, causing, philip, v, to, reverse, course, and, order, his, fleet, to, retreat, averting, open, conflict, for, the, time, being, in, 215, bc, at, the, height, of, the, second, punic, war, with, the, carthaginian, empire, roman, authorities, intercepted, a, ship, off, the, calabrian, coast, holding, a, macedonian, envoy, and, a, carthaginian, ambassador, in, possession, of, a, treaty, composed, by, hannibal, declaring, an, alliance, with, philip, v, the, treaty, stipulated, that, carthage, had, the, sole, right, to, negotiate, the, terms, of, rome, s, hypothetical, surrender, and, promised, mutual, aid, if, a, resurgent, rome, should, seek, revenge, against, either, macedonia, or, carthage, although, the, macedonians, were, perhaps, only, interested, in, safeguarding, their, newly, conquered, territories, in, illyria, the, romans, were, nevertheless, able, to, thwart, whatever, grand, ambitions, philip, v, had, for, the, adriatic, region, during, the, first, macedonian, war, 214, 205, bc, in, 214, bc, rome, positioned, a, naval, fleet, at, oricus, which, was, assaulted, along, with, apollonia, by, macedonian, forces, when, the, macedonians, captured, lissus, in, 212, bc, the, roman, senate, responded, by, inciting, the, aetolian, league, sparta, elis, messenia, and, attalus, i, r, 241, 197, bc, of, pergamon, to, wage, war, against, philip, v, keeping, him, occupied, and, away, from, italy, the, aetolian, league, concluded, a, peace, agreement, with, philip, v, in, 206, bc, and, the, roman, republic, negotiated, the, treaty, of, phoenice, in, 205, bc, ending, the, war, and, allowing, the, macedonians, to, retain, some, captured, settlements, in, illyria, although, the, romans, rejected, an, aetolian, request, in, 202, bc, for, rome, to, declare, war, on, macedonia, once, again, the, roman, senate, gave, serious, consideration, to, the, similar, offer, made, by, pergamon, and, its, ally, rhodes, in, 201, bc, these, states, were, concerned, about, philip, v, s, alliance, with, antiochus, iii, the, great, of, the, seleucid, empire, which, invaded, the, war, weary, and, financially, exhausted, ptolemaic, empire, in, the, fifth, syrian, war, 202, 195, bc, as, philip, v, captured, ptolemaic, settlements, in, the, aegean, sea, although, rome, s, envoys, played, a, critical, role, in, convincing, athens, to, join, the, anti, macedonian, alliance, with, pergamon, and, rhodes, in, 200, bc, the, comitia, centuriata, people, s, assembly, rejected, the, roman, senate, s, proposal, for, a, declaration, of, war, on, macedonia, meanwhile, philip, v, conquered, territories, in, the, hellespont, and, bosporus, as, well, as, ptolemaic, samos, which, led, rhodes, to, form, an, alliance, with, pergamon, byzantium, cyzicus, and, chios, against, macedonia, despite, philip, v, s, nominal, alliance, with, the, seleucid, king, he, lost, the, naval, battle, of, chios, in, 201, bc, and, was, blockaded, at, bargylia, by, the, rhodian, and, pergamene, navies, while, philip, v, was, busy, fighting, rome, s, greek, allies, rome, viewed, this, as, an, opportunity, to, punish, this, former, ally, of, hannibal, with, a, war, that, they, hoped, would, supply, a, victory, and, require, few, resources, the, roman, senate, demanded, that, philip, v, cease, hostilities, against, neighboring, greek, powers, and, defer, to, an, international, arbitration, committee, for, settling, grievances, when, the, comitia, centuriata, finally, voted, in, approval, of, the, roman, senate, s, declaration, of, war, in, 200, bc, and, handed, their, ultimatum, to, philip, v, demanding, that, a, tribunal, assess, the, damages, owed, to, rhodes, and, pergamon, the, macedonian, king, rejected, it, this, marked, the, beginning, of, the, second, macedonian, war, 200, 197, bc, with, publius, sulpicius, galba, maximus, spearheading, military, operations, in, apollonia, the, macedonians, successfully, defended, their, territory, for, roughly, two, years, but, the, roman, consul, titus, quinctius, flamininus, managed, to, expel, philip, v, from, macedonia, in, 198, bc, forcing, his, men, to, take, refuge, in, thessaly, when, the, achaean, league, switched, their, loyalties, from, macedonia, to, rome, the, macedonian, king, sued, for, peace, but, the, terms, offered, were, considered, too, stringent, and, so, the, war, continued, in, june, 197, bc, the, macedonians, were, defeated, at, the, battle, of, cynoscephalae, rome, then, ratified, a, treaty, that, forced, macedonia, to, relinquish, control, of, much, of, its, greek, possessions, outside, of, macedonia, proper, if, only, to, act, as, a, buffer, against, illyrian, and, thracian, incursions, into, greece, although, some, greeks, suspected, roman, intentions, of, supplanting, macedonia, as, the, new, hegemonic, power, in, greece, flaminius, announced, at, the, isthmian, games, of, 196, bc, that, rome, intended, to, preserve, greek, liberty, by, leaving, behind, no, garrisons, and, by, not, exacting, tribute, of, any, kind, his, promise, was, delayed, by, negotiations, with, the, spartan, king, nabis, who, had, meanwhile, captured, argos, yet, roman, forces, evacuated, greece, in, 194, bc, encouraged, by, the, aetolian, league, and, their, calls, to, liberate, greece, from, the, romans, the, seleucid, king, antiochus, iii, landed, with, his, army, at, demetrias, thessaly, in, 192, bc, and, was, elected, strategos, by, the, aetolians, macedonia, the, achaean, league, and, other, greek, city, states, maintained, their, alliance, with, rome, the, romans, defeated, the, seleucids, in, the, 191, bc, battle, of, thermopylae, as, well, as, the, battle, of, magnesia, in, 190, bc, forcing, the, seleucids, to, pay, a, war, indemnity, dismantle, most, of, its, navy, and, abandon, its, claims, to, any, territories, north, or, west, of, the, taurus, mountains, in, the, 188, bc, treaty, of, apamea, with, rome, s, acceptance, philip, v, was, able, to, capture, some, cities, in, central, greece, in, 191, 189, bc, that, had, been, allied, to, antiochus, iii, while, rhodes, and, eumenes, ii, r, 197, 159, bc, of, pergamon, gained, territories, in, asia, minor, failing, to, please, all, sides, in, various, territorial, disputes, the, roman, senate, decided, in, 184, 183, bc, to, force, philip, v, to, abandon, aenus, and, maronea, since, these, had, been, declared, free, cities, in, the, treaty, of, apamea, this, assuaged, the, fear, of, eumenes, ii, that, macedonia, could, pose, a, threat, to, his, lands, in, the, hellespont, perseus, of, macedon, r, 179, 168, bc, succeeded, philip, v, and, executed, his, brother, demetrius, who, had, been, favored, by, the, romans, but, was, charged, by, perseus, with, high, treason, perseus, then, attempted, to, form, marriage, alliances, with, prusias, ii, of, bithynia, and, seleucus, iv, philopator, of, the, seleucid, empire, along, with, renewed, relations, with, rhodes, that, greatly, unsettled, eumenes, ii, although, eumenes, ii, attempted, to, undermine, these, diplomatic, relationships, perseus, fostered, an, alliance, with, the, boeotian, league, extended, his, authority, into, illyria, and, thrace, and, in, 174, bc, won, the, role, of, managing, the, temple, of, apollo, at, delphi, as, a, member, of, the, amphictyonic, council, eumenes, ii, came, to, rome, in, 172, bc, and, delivered, a, speech, to, the, senate, denouncing, the, alleged, crimes, and, transgressions, of, perseus, this, convinced, the, roman, senate, to, declare, the, third, macedonian, war, 171, 168, bc, although, perseus, s, forces, were, victorious, against, the, romans, at, the, battle, of, callinicus, in, 171, bc, the, macedonian, army, was, defeated, at, the, battle, of, pydna, in, june, 168, bc, perseus, fled, to, samothrace, but, surrendered, shortly, afterwards, was, brought, to, rome, for, the, triumph, of, lucius, aemilius, paullus, macedonicus, and, was, placed, under, house, arrest, at, alba, fucens, where, he, died, in, 166, bc, the, romans, abolished, the, macedonian, monarchy, by, installing, four, separate, allied, republics, in, its, stead, their, capitals, located, at, amphipolis, thessalonica, pella, and, pelagonia, the, romans, imposed, severe, laws, inhibiting, many, social, and, economic, interactions, between, the, inhabitants, of, these, republics, including, the, banning, of, marriages, between, them, and, the, temporary, prohibition, on, gold, and, silver, mining, a, certain, andriscus, claiming, antigonid, descent, rebelled, against, the, romans, and, was, pronounced, king, of, macedonia, defeating, the, army, of, the, roman, praetor, publius, juventius, thalna, during, the, fourth, macedonian, war, 150, 148, bc, despite, this, andriscus, was, defeated, in, 148, bc, at, the, second, battle, of, pydna, by, quintus, caecilius, metellus, macedonicus, whose, forces, occupied, the, kingdom, this, was, followed, in, 146, bc, by, the, roman, destruction, of, carthage, and, victory, over, the, achaean, league, at, the, battle, of, corinth, ushering, in, the, era, of, roman, greece, and, the, gradual, establishment, of, the, roman, province, of, macedonia, at, the, head, of, macedonia, s, government, was, the, king, basileus, from, at, least, the, reign, of, philip, ii, the, king, was, assisted, by, the, royal, pages, basilikoi, paides, bodyguards, somatophylakes, companions, hetairoi, friends, philoi, an, assembly, that, included, members, of, the, military, and, during, the, hellenistic, period, magistrates, evidence, is, lacking, regarding, the, extent, to, which, each, of, these, groups, shared, authority, with, the, king, or, if, their, existence, had, a, basis, in, a, formal, constitutional, framework, before, the, reign, of, philip, ii, the, only, institution, supported, by, textual, evidence, is, the, monarchy, the, earliest, known, government, of, ancient, macedonia, was, that, of, its, monarchy, lasting, until, 167, bc, when, it, was, abolished, by, the, romans, the, macedonian, hereditary, monarchy, existed, since, at, least, the, time, of, archaic, greece, with, homeric, aristocratic, roots, in, mycenaean, greece, thucydides, wrote, that, in, previous, ages, macedonia, was, divided, into, small, tribal, regions, each, having, its, own, petty, king, the, tribes, of, lower, macedonia, eventually, coalescing, under, one, great, king, who, exercised, power, as, an, overlord, over, the, lesser, kings, of, upper, macedonia, the, direct, line, of, father, to, son, succession, was, broken, after, the, assassination, of, orestes, of, macedon, in, 396, bc, allegedly, by, his, regent, and, successor, aeropus, ii, of, macedon, clouding, the, issue, of, whether, primogeniture, was, the, established, custom, or, if, there, was, a, constitutional, right, for, an, assembly, of, the, army, or, of, the, people, to, choose, another, king, it, is, unclear, if, the, male, offspring, of, macedonian, queens, or, consorts, were, always, preferred, over, others, given, the, accession, of, archelaus, i, of, macedon, son, of, perdiccas, ii, of, macedon, and, a, slave, woman, although, archelaus, succeeded, the, throne, after, murdering, his, father, s, designated, heir, apparent, it, is, known, that, macedonian, kings, before, philip, ii, upheld, the, privileges, and, carried, out, the, responsibilities, of, hosting, foreign, diplomats, determining, the, kingdom, s, foreign, policies, and, negotiating, alliances, with, foreign, powers, after, the, greek, victory, at, salamis, in, 480, bc, the, persian, commander, mardonius, had, alexander, i, of, macedon, sent, to, athens, as, a, chief, envoy, to, orchestrate, an, alliance, between, the, achaemenid, empire, and, athens, the, decision, to, send, alexander, was, based, on, his, marriage, alliance, with, a, noble, persian, house, and, his, previous, formal, relationship, with, the, city, state, of, athens, with, their, ownership, of, natural, resources, including, gold, silver, timber, and, royal, land, the, early, macedonian, kings, were, also, capable, of, bribing, foreign, and, domestic, parties, with, impressive, gifts, little, is, known, about, the, judicial, system, of, ancient, macedonia, except, that, the, king, acted, as, the, chief, judge, of, the, kingdom, the, macedonian, kings, were, also, supreme, commanders, of, the, military, philip, ii, was, also, highly, regarded, for, his, acts, of, piety, in, serving, as, the, high, priest, of, the, nation, he, performed, daily, ritual, sacrifices, and, led, religious, festivals, alexander, imitated, various, aspects, of, his, father, s, reign, such, as, granting, land, and, gifts, to, loyal, aristocratic, followers, but, lost, some, core, support, among, them, for, adopting, some, of, the, trappings, of, an, eastern, persian, monarch, a, lord, and, master, as, carol, j, king, suggests, instead, of, a, comrade, in, arms, as, was, the, traditional, relationship, of, macedonian, kings, with, their, companions, alexander, s, father, philip, ii, was, perhaps, influenced, by, persian, traditions, when, he, adopted, institutions, similar, to, those, found, in, the, achaemenid, realm, such, as, having, a, royal, secretary, royal, archive, royal, pages, and, a, seated, throne, the, royal, pages, were, adolescent, boys, and, young, men, conscripted, from, aristocratic, households, and, serving, the, kings, of, macedonia, perhaps, from, the, reign, of, philip, ii, onward, although, more, solid, evidence, dates, to, the, reign, of, alexander, the, great, royal, pages, played, no, direct, role, in, high, politics, and, were, conscripted, as, a, means, to, introduce, them, to, political, life, after, a, period, of, training, and, service, pages, were, expected, to, become, members, of, the, king, s, companions, and, personal, retinue, during, their, training, pages, were, expected, to, guard, the, king, as, he, slept, supply, him, with, horses, aid, him, in, mounting, his, horse, accompany, him, on, royal, hunts, and, serve, him, during, symposia, i, e, formal, drinking, parties, although, there, is, little, evidence, for, royal, pages, in, the, antigonid, period, it, is, known, that, some, of, them, fled, with, perseus, of, macedon, to, samothrace, following, his, defeat, by, the, romans, in, 168, bc, royal, bodyguards, served, as, the, closest, members, to, the, king, at, court, and, on, the, battlefield, they, were, split, into, two, categories, the, agema, of, the, hypaspistai, a, type, of, ancient, special, forces, usually, numbering, in, the, hundreds, and, a, smaller, group, of, men, handpicked, by, the, king, either, for, their, individual, merits, or, to, honor, the, noble, families, to, which, they, belonged, therefore, the, bodyguards, limited, in, number, and, forming, the, king, s, inner, circle, were, not, always, responsible, for, protecting, the, king, s, life, on, and, off, the, battlefield, their, title, and, office, was, more, a, mark, of, distinction, perhaps, used, to, quell, rivalries, between, aristocratic, houses, the, companions, including, the, elite, companion, cavalry, and, pezhetairoi, infantry, represented, a, substantially, larger, group, than, the, king, s, bodyguards, the, most, trusted, or, highest, ranking, companions, formed, a, council, that, served, as, an, advisory, body, to, the, king, a, small, amount, of, evidence, suggests, the, existence, of, an, assembly, of, the, army, during, times, of, war, and, a, people, s, assembly, during, times, of, peace, members, of, the, council, had, the, right, to, speak, freely, and, although, there, is, no, direct, evidence, that, they, voted, on, affairs, of, state, it, is, clear, that, the, king, was, at, least, occasionally, pressured, to, agree, to, their, demands, the, assembly, was, apparently, given, the, right, to, judge, cases, of, high, treason, and, assign, punishments, for, them, such, as, when, alexander, the, great, acted, as, prosecutor, in, the, trial, and, conviction, of, three, alleged, conspirators, in, his, father, s, assassination, plot, while, many, others, were, acquitted, however, there, is, perhaps, insufficient, evidence, to, allow, a, conclusion, that, councils, and, assemblies, were, regularly, upheld, or, constitutionally, grounded, or, that, their, decisions, were, always, heeded, by, the, king, at, the, death, of, alexander, the, great, the, companions, immediately, formed, a, council, to, assume, control, of, his, empire, but, it, was, soon, destabilized, by, open, rivalry, and, conflict, between, its, members, the, army, also, used, mutiny, as, a, tool, to, achieve, political, ends, antigonid, macedonian, kings, relied, on, various, regional, officials, to, conduct, affairs, of, state, this, included, high, ranking, municipal, officials, such, as, the, military, strategos, and, the, politarch, i, e, the, elected, governor, archon, of, a, large, city, polis, as, well, as, the, politico, religious, office, of, the, epistates, no, evidence, exists, about, the, personal, backgrounds, of, these, officials, although, they, may, have, been, chosen, among, the, same, group, of, aristocratic, philoi, and, hetairoi, who, filled, vacancies, for, army, officers, in, ancient, athens, the, athenian, democracy, was, restored, on, three, separate, occasions, following, the, initial, conquest, of, the, city, by, antipater, in, 322, bc, when, it, fell, repeatedly, under, macedonian, rule, it, was, governed, by, a, macedonian, imposed, oligarchy, composed, of, the, wealthiest, members, of, the, city, state, other, city, states, were, handled, quite, differently, and, were, allowed, a, greater, degree, of, autonomy, after, philip, ii, conquered, amphipolis, in, 357, bc, the, city, was, allowed, to, retain, its, democracy, including, its, constitution, popular, assembly, city, council, boule, and, yearly, elections, for, new, officials, but, a, macedonian, garrison, was, housed, within, the, city, walls, along, with, a, macedonian, royal, commissioner, epistates, to, monitor, the, city, s, political, affairs, philippi, the, city, founded, by, philip, ii, was, the, only, other, city, in, the, macedonian, commonwealth, that, had, a, democratic, government, with, popular, assemblies, since, the, assembly, ecclesia, of, thessaloniki, seems, to, have, had, only, a, passive, function, in, practice, some, cities, also, maintained, their, own, municipal, revenues, the, macedonian, king, and, central, government, administered, the, revenues, generated, by, temples, and, priesthoods, within, the, macedonian, commonwealth, some, evidence, from, the, 3rd, century, bc, indicates, that, foreign, relations, were, handled, by, the, central, government, although, individual, macedonian, cities, nominally, participated, in, panhellenic, events, as, independent, entities, in, reality, the, granting, of, asylia, inviolability, diplomatic, immunity, and, the, right, of, asylum, at, sanctuaries, to, certain, cities, was, handled, directly, by, the, king, likewise, the, city, states, within, contemporary, greek, koina, i, e, federations, of, city, states, the, sympoliteia, obeyed, the, federal, decrees, voted, on, collectively, by, the, members, of, their, league, in, city, states, belonging, to, a, league, or, commonwealth, the, granting, of, proxenia, i, e, the, hosting, of, foreign, ambassadors, was, usually, a, right, shared, by, local, and, central, authorities, abundant, evidence, exists, for, the, granting, of, proxenia, as, being, the, sole, prerogative, of, central, authorities, in, the, neighboring, epirote, league, and, some, evidence, suggests, the, same, arrangement, in, the, macedonian, commonwealth, city, states, that, were, allied, with, macedonia, issued, their, own, decrees, regarding, proxenia, foreign, leagues, also, formed, alliances, with, the, macedonian, kings, such, as, when, the, cretan, league, signed, treaties, with, demetrius, ii, aetolicus, and, antigonus, iii, doson, ensuring, enlistment, of, cretan, mercenaries, into, the, macedonian, army, and, elected, philip, v, of, macedon, as, honorary, protector, prostates, of, the, league, the, basic, structure, of, the, ancient, macedonian, army, was, the, division, between, the, companion, cavalry, hetairoi, and, the, foot, companions, pezhetairoi, augmented, by, various, allied, troops, foreign, levied, soldiers, and, mercenaries, the, foot, companions, existed, perhaps, since, the, reign, of, alexander, i, of, macedon, macedonian, cavalry, wearing, muscled, cuirasses, became, renowned, in, greece, during, and, after, their, involvement, in, the, peloponnesian, war, at, times, siding, with, either, athens, or, sparta, macedonian, infantry, in, this, period, consisted, of, poorly, trained, shepherds, and, farmers, while, the, cavalry, was, composed, of, noblemen, as, evidenced, by, early, 4th, century, bc, artwork, there, was, a, pronounced, spartan, influence, on, the, macedonian, army, before, philip, ii, nicholas, viktor, sekunda, states, that, at, the, beginning, of, philip, ii, s, reign, in, 359, bc, the, macedonian, army, consisted, of, 10, 000, infantry, and, 600, cavalry, yet, malcolm, errington, cautions, that, these, figures, cited, by, ancient, authors, should, be, treated, with, some, skepticism, after, spending, years, as, a, political, hostage, in, thebes, philip, ii, sought, to, imitate, the, greek, example, of, martial, exercises, and, the, issuing, of, standard, equipment, for, citizen, soldiery, and, succeeded, in, transforming, the, macedonian, army, from, a, levied, force, of, unprofessional, farmers, into, a, well, trained, professional, army, philip, ii, adopted, some, of, the, military, tactics, of, his, enemies, such, as, the, embolon, flying, wedge, cavalry, formation, of, the, scythians, his, infantry, wielded, peltai, shields, that, replaced, the, earlier, aspis, style, shields, were, equipped, with, protective, helmets, greaves, and, either, cuirasses, breastplates, or, kotthybos, stomach, bands, and, armed, with, sarissa, pikes, and, daggers, as, secondary, weapons, the, elite, hypaspistai, infantry, composed, of, handpicked, men, from, the, ranks, of, the, pezhetairoi, were, formed, during, the, reign, of, philip, ii, and, saw, continued, use, during, the, reign, of, alexander, the, great, philip, ii, was, also, responsible, for, the, establishment, of, the, royal, bodyguards, somatophylakes, for, his, lighter, missile, troops, philip, ii, employed, mercenary, cretan, archers, as, well, as, thracian, paeonian, and, illyrian, javelin, throwers, slingers, and, archers, he, hired, engineers, such, as, polyidus, of, thessaly, and, diades, of, pella, who, were, capable, of, building, state, of, the, art, siege, engines, and, artillery, that, fired, large, bolts, following, the, acquisition, of, the, lucrative, mines, at, krinides, renamed, philippi, the, royal, treasury, could, afford, to, field, a, permanent, professional, standing, army, the, increase, in, state, revenues, under, philip, ii, allowed, the, macedonians, to, build, a, small, navy, for, the, first, time, which, included, triremes, the, only, macedonian, cavalry, units, attested, under, alexander, were, the, companion, cavalry, yet, he, formed, a, hipparchia, i, e, unit, of, a, few, hundred, horsemen, of, companion, cavalry, composed, entirely, of, ethnic, persians, while, campaigning, in, asia, when, marching, his, forces, into, asia, alexander, brought, 1, 800, cavalrymen, from, macedonia, 1, 800, cavalrymen, from, thessaly, 600, cavalrymen, from, the, rest, of, greece, and, 900, prodromoi, cavalry, from, thrace, antipater, was, able, to, quickly, raise, a, force, of, 600, native, macedonian, cavalry, to, fight, in, the, lamian, war, when, it, began, in, 323, bc, the, most, elite, members, of, alexander, s, hypaspistai, were, designated, as, the, agema, and, a, new, term, for, hypaspistai, emerged, after, the, battle, of, gaugamela, in,

phalanx, infantry, numbered, some, 12, 000, men, 3, 000, of, which, were, elite, hypaspistai, and, 9, 000, of, which, were, pezhetairoi, alexander, continued, the, use, of, cretan, archers, and, introduced, native, macedonian, archers, into, the, army, after, the, battle, of, gaugamela, archers, of, west, asian, backgrounds, became, commonplace, the, macedonian, army, continued, to, evolve, under, the, antigonid, dynasty, it, is, uncertain, how, many, men, were, appointed, as, somatophylakes, which, numbered, eight, men, at, the, end, of, alexander, the, great, s, reign, while, the, hypaspistai, seem, to, have, morphed, into, assistants, of, the, somatophylakes, at, the, battle, of, cynoscephalae, in, 197, bc, the, macedonians, commanded, some, 16, 000, phalanx, pikemen, alexander, the, great, s, royal, squadron, of, companion, cavalry, contained, 800, men, the, same, number, of, cavalrymen, in, the, sacred, squadron, latin, sacra, ala, greek, hiera, ile, commanded, by, philip, v, of, macedon, during, the, social, war, of, 219, bc, the, regular, macedonian, cavalry, numbered, 3, 000, at, callinicus, which, was, separate, from, the, sacred, squadron, and, royal, cavalry, while, macedonian, cavalry, of, the, 4th, century, bc, had, fought, without, shields, the, use, of, shields, by, cavalry, was, adopted, from, the, celtic, invaders, of, the, 270s, bc, who, settled, in, galatia, central, anatolia, thanks, to, contemporary, inscriptions, from, amphipolis, and, greia, dated, 218, and, 181, bc, respectively, historians, have, been, able, to, partially, piece, together, the, organization, of, the, antigonid, army, under, philip, v, from, at, least, the, time, of, antigonus, iii, doson, the, most, elite, antigonid, period, infantry, were, the, peltasts, lighter, and, more, maneuverable, soldiers, wielding, peltai, javelins, swords, and, a, smaller, bronze, shield, than, macedonian, phalanx, pikemen, although, they, sometimes, served, in, that, capacity, among, the, peltasts, roughly, 2, 000, men, were, selected, to, serve, in, the, elite, agema, vanguard, with, other, peltasts, numbering, roughly, 3, 000, the, number, of, peltasts, varied, over, time, perhaps, never, more, than, 5, 000, men, they, fought, alongside, the, phalanx, pikemen, divided, now, into, chalkaspides, bronze, shield, and, leukaspides, white, shield, regiments, the, antigonid, macedonian, kings, continued, to, expand, and, equip, the, navy, cassander, maintained, a, small, fleet, at, pydna, demetrius, i, of, macedon, had, one, at, pella, and, antigonus, ii, gonatas, while, serving, as, a, general, for, demetrius, in, greece, used, the, navy, to, secure, the, macedonian, holdings, in, demetrias, chalkis, piraeus, and, corinth, the, navy, was, considerably, expanded, during, the, chremonidean, war, 267, 261, bc, allowing, the, macedonian, navy, to, defeat, the, ptolemaic, egyptian, navy, at, the, 255, bc, battle, of, cos, and, 245, bc, battle, of, andros, and, enabling, macedonian, influence, to, spread, over, the, cyclades, antigonus, iii, doson, used, the, macedonian, navy, to, invade, caria, while, philip, v, sent, 200, ships, to, fight, in, the, battle, of, chios, in, 201, bc, the, macedonian, navy, was, reduced, to, a, mere, six, vessels, as, agreed, in, the, 197, bc, peace, treaty, that, concluded, the, second, macedonian, war, with, the, roman, republic, although, perseus, of, macedon, quickly, assembled, some, lemboi, at, the, outbreak, of, the, third, macedonian, war, in, 171, bc, following, its, adoption, as, the, court, language, of, philip, ii, of, macedon, s, regime, authors, of, ancient, macedonia, wrote, their, works, in, koine, greek, the, lingua, franca, of, late, classical, and, hellenistic, greece, rare, textual, evidence, indicates, that, the, native, macedonian, language, was, either, a, dialect, of, greek, similar, to, thessalian, greek, and, northwestern, greek, or, a, language, closely, related, to, greek, the, vast, majority, of, surviving, inscriptions, from, ancient, macedonia, were, written, in, attic, greek, and, its, successor, koine, attic, and, later, koine, greek, was, the, preferred, language, of, the, ancient, macedonian, army, although, it, is, known, that, alexander, the, great, once, shouted, an, emergency, order, in, macedonian, to, his, royal, guards, during, the, drinking, party, where, he, killed, cleitus, the, black, macedonian, became, extinct, in, either, the, hellenistic, or, the, roman, period, and, entirely, replaced, by, koine, greek, by, the, 5th, century, bc, the, macedonians, and, the, southern, greeks, worshiped, more, or, less, the, same, deities, of, the, greek, pantheon, in, macedonia, political, and, religious, offices, were, often, intertwined, for, instance, the, head, of, state, for, the, city, of, amphipolis, also, served, as, the, priest, of, asklepios, greek, god, of, medicine, a, similar, arrangement, existed, at, cassandreia, where, a, cult, priest, honoring, the, city, s, founder, cassander, was, the, nominal, head, of, the, city, the, main, sanctuary, of, zeus, was, maintained, at, dion, while, another, at, veria, was, dedicated, to, herakles, and, was, patronized, by, demetrius, ii, aetolicus, r, 239, 229, bc, meanwhile, foreign, cults, from, egypt, were, fostered, by, the, royal, court, such, as, the, temple, of, sarapis, at, thessaloniki, the, macedonians, also, had, relations, with, international, cults, for, example, macedonian, kings, philip, iii, of, macedon, and, alexander, iv, of, macedon, made, votive, offerings, to, the, internationally, esteemed, samothrace, temple, complex, of, the, cabeiri, mystery, cult, in, the, three, royal, tombs, at, vergina, professional, painters, decorated, the, walls, with, a, mythological, scene, of, hades, abducting, persephone, and, royal, hunting, scenes, while, lavish, grave, goods, including, weapons, armor, drinking, vessels, and, personal, items, were, housed, with, the, dead, whose, bones, were, burned, before, burial, in, golden, coffins, some, grave, goods, and, decorations, were, common, in, other, macedonian, tombs, yet, some, items, found, at, vergina, were, distinctly, tied, to, royalty, including, a, diadem, luxurious, goods, and, arms, and, armor, scholars, have, debated, about, the, identity, of, the, tomb, occupants, since, the, discovery, of, their, remains, in, 1977, 1978, and, recent, research, and, forensic, examination, have, concluded, that, at, least, one, of, the, persons, buried, was, philip, ii, located, near, tomb, 1, are, the, above, ground, ruins, of, a, heroon, a, shrine, for, cult, worship, of, the, dead, in, 2014, the, ancient, macedonian, kasta, tomb, was, discovered, outside, of, amphipolis, and, is, the, largest, ancient, tomb, found, in, greece, as, of, 2017, young, macedonian, men, were, typically, expected, to, engage, in, hunting, and, martial, combat, as, a, by, product, of, their, transhumance, lifestyle, of, herding, livestock, such, as, goats, and, sheep, while, horse, breeding, and, raising, cattle, were, other, common, pursuits, some, macedonians, engaged, in, farming, often, with, irrigation, land, reclamation, and, horticulture, activities, supported, by, the, macedonian, state, the, macedonian, economy, and, state, finances, were, mainly, supported, by, logging, and, by, mining, valuable, minerals, such, as, copper, iron, gold, and, silver, the, conversion, of, these, raw, materials, into, finished, products, and, the, sale, of, those, products, encouraged, the, growth, of, urban, centers, and, a, gradual, shift, away, from, the, traditional, rustic, macedonian, lifestyle, during, the, course, of, the, 5th, century, bc, the, macedonian, king, was, an, autocratic, figure, at, the, head, of, both, government, and, society, with, arguably, unlimited, authority, to, handle, affairs, of, state, and, public, policy, but, he, was, also, the, leader, of, a, very, personal, regime, with, close, relationships, or, connections, to, his, hetairoi, the, core, of, the, macedonian, aristocracy, these, aristocrats, were, second, only, to, the, king, in, terms, of, power, and, privilege, filling, the, ranks, of, his, administration, and, serving, as, commanding, officers, in, the, military, it, was, in, the, more, bureaucratic, regimes, of, the, hellenistic, kingdoms, that, succeeded, alexander, the, great, s, empire, where, greater, social, mobility, for, members, of, society, seeking, to, join, the, aristocracy, could, be, found, especially, in, ptolemaic, egypt, although, governed, by, a, king, and, martial, aristocracy, macedonia, seems, to, have, lacked, the, widespread, use, of, slaves, seen, in, contemporaneous, greek, states, by, the, reign, of, archelaus, i, in, the, 5th, century, bc, the, ancient, macedonian, elite, was, importing, customs, and, artistic, traditions, from, other, regions, of, greece, while, retaining, more, archaic, perhaps, homeric, funerary, rites, connected, with, the, symposium, that, were, typified, by, items, such, as, the, decorative, metal, kraters, that, held, the, ashes, of, deceased, macedonian, nobility, in, their, tombs, among, these, is, the, large, bronze, derveni, krater, from, a, 4th, century, bc, tomb, of, thessaloniki, decorated, with, scenes, of, the, greek, god, dionysus, and, his, entourage, and, belonging, to, an, aristocrat, who, had, had, a, military, career, macedonian, metalwork, usually, followed, athenian, styles, of, vase, shapes, from, the, 6th, century, bc, onward, with, drinking, vessels, jewellery, containers, crowns, diadems, and, coins, among, the, many, metal, objects, found, in, macedonian, tombs, surviving, macedonian, painted, artwork, includes, frescoes, and, murals, but, also, decoration, on, sculpted, artwork, such, as, statues, and, reliefs, for, instance, trace, colors, still, exist, on, the, bas, reliefs, of, the, late, 4th, century, bc, alexander, sarcophagus, macedonian, paintings, have, allowed, historians, to, investigate, the, clothing, fashions, as, well, as, military, gear, worn, by, the, ancient, macedonians, aside, from, metalwork, and, painting, mosaics, are, another, significant, form, of, surviving, macedonian, artwork, the, stag, hunt, mosaic, of, pella, with, its, three, dimensional, qualities, and, illusionist, style, show, clear, influence, from, painted, artwork, and, wider, hellenistic, art, trends, although, the, rustic, theme, of, hunting, was, tailored, to, macedonian, tastes, the, similar, lion, hunt, mosaic, of, pella, illustrates, either, a, scene, of, alexander, the, great, with, his, companion, craterus, or, simply, a, conventional, illustration, of, the, royal, diversion, of, hunting, mosaics, with, mythological, themes, include, scenes, of, dionysus, riding, a, panther, and, helen, of, troy, being, abducted, by, theseus, the, latter, of, which, employs, illusionist, qualities, and, realistic, shading, similar, to, macedonian, paintings, common, themes, of, macedonian, paintings, and, mosaics, include, warfare, hunting, and, aggressive, masculine, sexuality, i, e, abduction, of, women, for, rape, or, marriage, these, subjects, are, at, times, combined, within, a, single, work, and, perhaps, indicate, a, metaphorical, connection, philip, ii, was, assassinated, in, 336, bc, at, the, theatre, of, aigai, amid, games, and, spectacles, celebrating, the, marriage, of, his, daughter, cleopatra, alexander, the, great, was, allegedly, a, great, admirer, of, both, theatre, and, music, he, was, especially, fond, of, the, plays, by, classical, athenian, tragedians, aeschylus, sophocles, and, euripides, whose, works, formed, part, of, a, proper, greek, education, for, his, new, eastern, subjects, alongside, studies, in, the, greek, language, including, the, epics, of, homer, while, he, and, his, army, were, stationed, at, tyre, in, modern, day, lebanon, alexander, had, his, generals, act, as, judges, not, only, for, athletic, contests, but, also, for, stage, performances, of, greek, tragedies, the, contemporaneous, famous, actors, thessalus, and, athenodorus, performed, at, the, event, music, was, also, appreciated, in, macedonia, in, addition, to, the, agora, the, gymnasium, the, theatre, and, religious, sanctuaries, and, temples, dedicated, to, greek, gods, and, goddesses, one, of, the, main, markers, of, a, true, greek, city, in, the, empire, of, alexander, the, great, was, the, presence, of, an, odeon, for, musical, performances, this, was, the, case, not, only, for, alexandria, in, egypt, but, also, for, cities, as, distant, as, ai, khanoum, in, what, is, now, modern, day, afghanistan, perdiccas, ii, of, macedon, was, able, to, host, well, known, classical, greek, intellectual, visitors, at, his, royal, court, such, as, the, lyric, poet, melanippides, and, the, renowned, medical, doctor, hippocrates, and, pindar, s, enkomion, written, for, alexander, i, of, macedon, may, have, been, composed, at, his, court, archelaus, i, received, many, more, greek, scholars, artists, and, celebrities, at, his, court, than, his, predecessors, his, honored, guests, included, the, painter, zeuxis, the, architect, callimachus, the, poets, choerilus, of, samos, timotheus, of, miletus, and, agathon, as, well, as, the, famous, athenian, playwright, euripides, the, philosopher, aristotle, who, studied, at, the, platonic, academy, of, athens, and, established, the, aristotelian, school, of, thought, moved, to, macedonia, and, is, said, to, have, tutored, the, young, alexander, the, great, as, well, as, serving, as, an, esteemed, diplomat, for, philip, ii, among, alexander, s, retinue, of, artists, writers, and, philosophers, was, pyrrho, of, elis, founder, of, pyrrhonism, the, school, of, philosophical, skepticism, during, the, antigonid, period, antigonos, gonatas, fostered, cordial, relationships, with, menedemos, of, eretria, founder, of, the, eretrian, school, of, philosophy, and, zenon, the, founder, of, stoicism, in, terms, of, early, greek, historiography, and, later, roman, historiography, felix, jacoby, identified, thirteen, possible, ancient, historians, who, wrote, about, macedonia, in, his, fragmente, der, griechischen, historiker, aside, from, accounts, in, herodotus, and, thucydides, the, works, compiled, by, jacoby, are, only, fragmentary, whereas, other, works, are, completely, lost, such, as, the, history, of, an, illyrian, war, fought, by, perdiccas, iii, written, by, antipater, the, macedonian, historians, marsyas, of, pella, and, marsyas, of, philippi, wrote, histories, of, macedonia, the, ptolemaic, king, ptolemy, i, soter, authored, a, history, about, alexander, and, hieronymus, of, cardia, wrote, a, history, about, alexander, s, royal, successors, following, the, indian, campaign, of, alexander, the, great, the, macedonian, military, officer, nearchus, wrote, a, work, of, his, voyage, from, the, mouth, of, the, indus, river, to, the, persian, gulf, the, macedonian, historian, craterus, published, a, compilation, of, decrees, made, by, the, popular, assembly, of, the, athenian, democracy, ostensibly, while, attending, the, school, of, aristotle, philip, v, of, macedon, had, manuscripts, of, the, history, of, philip, ii, written, by, theopompus, gathered, by, his, court, scholars, and, disseminated, with, further, copies, when, alexander, i, of, macedon, petitioned, to, compete, in, the, foot, race, of, the, ancient, olympic, games, the, event, organizers, at, first, denied, his, request, explaining, that, only, greeks, were, allowed, to, compete, however, alexander, i, produced, proof, of, an, argead, royal, genealogy, showing, ancient, argive, temenid, lineage, a, move, that, ultimately, convinced, the, olympic, hellanodikai, authorities, of, his, greek, descent, and, ability, to, compete, by, the, end, of, the, 5th, century, bc, the, macedonian, king, archelaus, i, was, crowned, with, the, olive, wreath, at, both, olympia, and, delphi, in, the, pythian, games, for, winning, chariot, racing, contests, philip, ii, allegedly, heard, of, the, olympic, victory, of, his, horse, in, either, an, individual, horse, race, or, chariot, race, on, the, same, day, his, son, alexander, the, great, was, born, on, either, 19, or, 20, july, 356, bc, non, royal, macedonians, also, competed, in, and, won, various, olympic, contests, by, the, 4th, century, bc, in, addition, to, literary, contests, alexander, the, great, staged, competitions, for, music, and, athletics, across, his, empire, ancient, macedonia, produced, only, a, few, fine, foods, or, beverages, that, were, highly, appreciated, elsewhere, in, the, greek, world, including, eels, from, the, strymonian, gulf, and, special, wine, produced, in, chalcidice, the, earliest, known, use, of, flat, bread, as, a, plate, for, meat, was, made, in, macedonia, during, the, 3rd, century, bc, which, perhaps, influenced, the, later, trencher, bread, of, medieval, europe, cattle, and, goats, were, consumed, although, there, was, no, notice, of, macedonian, mountain, cheeses, in, literature, until, the, middle, ages, the, comedic, playwright, menander, wrote, that, macedonian, dining, habits, penetrated, athenian, high, society, for, instance, the, introduction, of, meats, into, the, dessert, course, of, a, meal, the, macedonians, also, most, likely, introduced, mattye, to, athenian, cuisine, a, dish, usually, made, of, chicken, or, other, spiced, salted, and, sauced, meats, served, during, the, wine, course, this, particular, dish, was, derided, and, connected, with, licentiousness, and, drunkenness, in, a, play, by, the, athenian, comic, poet, alexis, about, the, declining, morals, of, athenians, in, the, age, of, demetrius, i, of, macedon, the, symposium, in, the, macedonian, and, wider, greek, realm, was, a, banquet, for, the, nobility, and, privileged, class, an, occasion, for, feasting, drinking, entertainment, and, sometimes, philosophical, discussion, the, hetairoi, leading, members, of, the, macedonian, aristocracy, were, expected, to, attend, such, feasts, with, their, king, they, were, also, expected, to, accompany, him, on, royal, hunts, for, the, acquisition, of, game, meat, as, well, as, for, sport, ancient, authors, and, modern, scholars, alike, disagree, about, the, precise, ethnic, identity, of, the, ancient, macedonians, the, predominant, viewpoint, supports, that, the, macedonians, were, truly, greeks, who, had, just, retained, a, more, archaic, lifestyle, than, those, living, in, southern, parts, of, greece, ernst, badian, notes, however, that, nearly, all, surviving, references, to, antagonisms, and, differences, between, greeks, and, macedonians, exist, in, the, written, speeches, of, arrian, who, lived, at, the, time, of, the, roman, empire, when, any, notion, of, an, ethnic, disparity, between, macedonians, and, other, greeks, was, incomprehensible, hatzopoulos, argues, that, there, was, no, real, ethnic, difference, between, macedonians, and, the, other, greeks, only, a, political, distinction, contrived, after, the, creation, of, the, league, of, corinth, in, 337, bc, which, was, led, by, macedonia, through, the, league, s, elected, hegemon, philip, ii, when, he, was, not, a, member, of, the, league, itself, n, g, l, hammond, asserts, that, ancient, views, differentiating, macedonia, s, ethnic, identity, from, the, rest, of, the, greek, speaking, world, should, be, seen, as, an, expression, of, conflict, between, two, different, political, systems, the, democratic, system, of, the, city, states, e, g, athens, versus, the, monarchy, macedonia, other, academics, who, concur, that, the, difference, between, the, macedonians, and, greeks, was, a, political, rather, than, a, true, ethnic, discrepancy, include, michael, b, sakellariou, malcolm, errington, and, craige, b, champion, anson, argues, that, some, hellenic, authors, expressed, complex, or, even, ever, changing, and, ambiguous, ideas, about, the, exact, ethnic, identity, of, the, macedonians, who, were, considered, by, some, as, barbarians, and, others, as, semi, greek, or, fully, greek, roger, d, woodard, asserts, that, in, addition, to, persisting, uncertainty, in, modern, times, about, the, proper, classification, of, the, macedonian, language, and, its, relation, to, greek, ancient, authors, also, presented, conflicting, ideas, about, the, macedonians, simon, hornblower, argues, on, the, greek, identity, of, the, macedonians, taking, into, consideration, their, origin, language, cults, and, customs, related, to, ancient, greek, traditions, any, preconceived, ethnic, differences, between, greeks, and, macedonians, faded, by, 148, bc, soon, after, the, roman, conquest, of, macedonia, and, then, the, rest, of, greece, with, the, defeat, of, the, achaean, league, by, the, roman, republic, at, the, battle, of, corinth, 146, bc, macedonian, architecture, although, utilizing, a, mixture, of, different, forms, and, styles, from, the, rest, of, greece, did, not, represent, a, unique, or, diverging, style, from, other, ancient, greek, architecture, among, the, classical, orders, macedonian, architects, favored, the, ionic, order, especially, in, the, peristyle, courtyards, of, private, homes, there, are, several, surviving, examples, albeit, in, ruins, of, macedonian, palatial, architecture, including, a, palace, at, the, site, of, the, capital, pella, the, summer, residence, of, vergina, near, the, old, capital, aigai, and, the, royal, residence, at, demetrias, near, modern, volos, at, vergina, the, ruins, of, three, large, banquet, halls, with, marble, tiled, floors, covered, in, the, debris, of, roof, tiles, with, floor, plan, dimensions, measuring, roughly, 16, 7, x, 17, 6, m, 54, 8, x, 57, 7, ft, demonstrate, perhaps, the, earliest, examples, of, monumental, triangular, roof, trusses, if, dated, before, the, reign, of, antigonus, ii, gonatas, or, even, the, onset, of, the, hellenistic, period, later, macedonian, architecture, also, featured, arches, and, vaults, the, palaces, of, both, vergina, and, demetrias, had, walls, made, of, sundried, bricks, while, the, latter, palace, had, four, corner, towers, around, a, central, courtyard, in, the, manner, of, a, fortified, residence, fit, for, a, king, or, at, least, a, military, governor, macedonian, rulers, also, sponsored, works, of, architecture, outside, of, macedonia, proper, for, instance, following, his, victory, at, the, battle, of, chaeronea, 338, bc, philip, ii, raised, a, round, memorial, building, at, olympia, known, as, the, philippeion, decorated, inside, with, statues, depicting, him, his, parents, amyntas, iii, of, macedon, and, eurydice, i, of, macedon, his, wife, olympias, and, his, son, alexander, the, great, the, ruins, of, roughly, twenty, greek, theatres, survive, in, the, present, day, regions, of, macedonia, and, thrace, in, greece, sixteen, open, air, theatres, three, odea, and, a, possible, theatre, in, veria, undergoing, excavation, by, the, hellenistic, period, it, became, common, for, greek, states, to, finance, the, development, and, proliferation, of, ever, more, powerful, torsion, siege, engines, naval, ships, and, standardized, designs, for, arms, and, armor, under, philip, ii, and, alexander, the, great, improvements, were, made, to, siege, artillery, such, as, bolt, shooting, ballistae, and, siege, engines, such, as, huge, rolling, siege, towers, e, w, marsden, and, m, y, treister, contend, that, the, macedonian, rulers, antigonus, i, monophthalmus, and, his, successor, demetrius, i, of, macedon, had, the, most, powerful, siege, artillery, of, the, hellenistic, world, at, the, end, of, the, 4th, century, bc, the, siege, of, salamis, cyprus, in, 306, bc, necessitated, the, building, of, large, siege, engines, and, drafting, of, craftsmen, from, parts, of, west, asia, the, siege, tower, commissioned, by, demetrius, i, for, the, macedonian, siege, of, rhodes, 305, 304, bc, and, defended, by, over, three, thousand, soldiers, was, built, at, a, height, of, nine, stories, it, had, a, base, of, 4, 300, square, feet, 399, square, metres, eight, wheels, that, were, steered, in, either, direction, by, pivots, three, sides, covered, in, iron, plates, to, protect, them, from, fire, and, mechanically, opened, windows, shielded, with, wool, stuffed, leather, curtains, to, soften, the, blow, of, ballistae, rounds, of, different, sizes, to, accommodate, the, firing, of, missiles, ranging, from, arrows, to, larger, bolts, during, the, siege, of, echinus, by, philip, v, of, macedon, in, 211, bc, the, besiegers, built, tunnels, to, protect, the, soldiers, and, sappers, as, they, went, back, and, forth, from, the, camp, to, the, siege, works, these, included, two, siege, towers, connected, by, a, makeshift, wickerwork, curtain, wall, mounted, with, stone, shooting, ballistae, and, sheds, to, protect, the, approach, of, the, battering, ram, despite, the, early, reputation, of, macedon, as, a, leader, in, siege, technology, alexandria, in, ptolemaic, egypt, became, the, center, for, technological, improvements, to, the, catapult, by, the,

are, some, inventions, that, may, have, originated, in, macedonia, aside, from, siege, engines, and, artillery, the, rotary, operated, olive, press, for, producing, olive, oil, may, have, been,

bc, although, it, could, have, simultaneously, existed, in, the, achaemenid, empire, the, first, known, clear, translucent, glass, pieces, of, the, greek, world, have, been, discovered, in, macedonia, and, rhodes, and, date, to, the, second, half, of, the, 4th, century, bc, greek, technical, and, scientific, literature, began, with, classical, athens, in, the, 5th, century, bc, while, the, major, production, centers, for, technical, innovation, and, texts, during, the, hellenistic, period, were, alexandria, rhodes, and, pergamon, the, minting, of, silver, coinage, began, during, the, reign, of, alexander, i, as, a, means, to, pay, for, royal, expenditures, archelaus, i, increased, the, silver, content, of, his, coins, as, well, as, minting, copper, coins, to, promote, foreign, and, domestic, commerce, the, minting, of, coinage, significantly, increased, during, the, reigns, of, philip, ii, and, alexander, the, great, especially, after, the, increase, in, state, revenues, following, the, seizure, of, the, pangaion, hills, during, the, hellenistic, period, the, royal, houses, of, macedonia, ptolemaic, egypt, and, the, attalid, kingdom, exercised, full, monopolistic, control, over, mining, activities, largely, to, ensure, the, funding, of, their, armies, by, the, end, of, the, conquests, of, alexander, the, great, nearly, thirty, mints, stretching, from, macedonia, to, babylon, produced, standard, coins, the, right, to, mint, coins, was, shared, by, central, and, some, local, governments, i, e, the, autonomous, municipal, governments, of, thessaloniki, pella, and, amphipolis, within, the, macedonian, commonwealth, the, macedonians, were, also, the, first, to, issue, different, coins, for, internal, and, external, circulation, state, revenues, were, also, raised, by, collecting, produce, from, arable, lands, timber, from, forests, and, taxes, on, imports, and, exports, at, harbors, some, mines, groves, agricultural, lands, and, forests, belonging, to, the, macedonian, state, were, exploited, by, the, macedonian, king, although, these, were, often, leased, as, assets, or, given, as, grants, to, members, of, the, nobility, such, as, the, hetairoi, and, philoi, tariffs, exacted, on, goods, flowing, in, and, out, of, macedonian, seaports, existed, from, at, least, the, reign, of, amyntas, iii, and, callistratus, of,

the, roman, senate, allowed, the, reopening, of, iron, and, copper, mines, but, forbade, the, mining, of, gold, and, silver, by, the, four, newly, established, autonomous, client, states, that, replaced, the, monarchy, in, macedonia, the, law, may, originally, have, been, conceived, by, the, senate, due, to, the, fear, that, material, wealth, gained, from, gold, and, silver, mining, operations, would, allow, the, macedonians, to, fund, an, armed, rebellion, the, romans, were, perhaps, also, concerned, with, stemming, inflation, caused, by, an, increased, money, supply, from, macedonian, silver, mining, the, macedonians, continued, minting, silver, coins, between, 167, and, 148, bc, i, e, just, before, the, establishment, of, the, roman, province, of, macedonia, and, when, the, romans, lifted, the, ban, on, macedonian, silver, mining, in, 158, bc, it, may, simply, have, reflected, the, local, reality, of, this, illicit, practice, continuing, regardless, of, the, senate, s, decree, the, reigns, of, philip, ii, and, alexander, the, great, witnessed, the, demise, of, classical, greece, and, the, birth, of, hellenistic, civilization, following, the, spread, of, greek, culture, to, the, near, east, during, and, after, alexander, s, conquests, macedonians, then, migrated, to, egypt, and, parts, of, asia, but, the, intensive, colonization, of, foreign, lands, sapped, the, available, manpower, in, macedonia, proper, weakening, the, kingdom, in, its, fight, with, other, hellenistic, powers, and, contributing, to, its, downfall, and, conquest, by, the, romans, however, the, diffusion, of, greek, culture, and, language, cemented, by, alexander, s, conquests, in, west, asia, and, north, africa, served, as, a, precondition, for, the, later, roman, expansion, into, these, territories, and, entire, basis, for, the, byzantine, empire, according, to, errington, the, ethnic, macedonian, rulers, of, the, ptolemaic, and, seleucid, successor, states, accepted, men, from, all, over, the, greek, world, as, their, hetairoi, companions, and, did, not, foster, a, national, identity, like, the, antigonids, modern, scholarship, has, focused, on, how, these, hellenistic, successor, kingdoms, were, influenced, more, by, their, macedonian, origins, than, eastern, or, southern, greek, traditions, while, spartan, society, remained, mostly, insular, and, athens, continued, placing, strict, limitations, on, acquiring, citizenship, the, cosmopolitan, hellenistic, cities, of, asia, and, northeastern, africa, bore, a, greater, resemblance, to, macedonian, cities, and, contained, a, mixture, of, subjects, including, natives, greek, and, macedonian, colonists, and, greek, speaking, hellenized, easterners, many, of, whom, were, the, product, of, intermarriage, between, greeks, and, native, populations, the, deification, of, macedonian, monarchs, perhaps, began, with, the, death, of, philip, ii, but, it, was, his, son, alexander, the, great, who, unambiguously, claimed, to, be, a, living, god, following, his, visit, to, the, oracle, of, didyma, in, 334, bc, that, suggested, his, divinity, alexander, traveled, to, the, oracle, of, zeus, ammon, the, greek, equivalent, of, the, egyptian, amun, ra, at, the, siwa, oasis, of, the, libyan, desert, in, 332, bc, to, confirm, his, divine, status, although, the, ptolemaic, and, seleucid, empires, maintained, ancestral, cults, and, deified, their, rulers, kings, were, not, worshiped, in, the, kingdom, of, macedonia, while, zeus, ammon, was, known, to, the, greeks, prior, to, alexander, s, reign, particularly, at, the, greek, colony, of, cyrene, libya, alexander, was, the, first, macedonian, monarch, to, patronize, egyptian, persian, and, babylonian, priesthoods, and, deities, strengthening, the, fusion, of, near, eastern, and, greek, religious, beliefs, after, his, reign, the, cult, of, isis, gradually, spread, throughout, the, hellenistic, and, roman, world, while, beliefs, in, the, egyptian, god, sarapis, were, thoroughly, hellenized, by, the, ptolemaic, rulers, of, egypt, before, the, spread, of, his, cult, to, macedonia, and, the, aegean, region, the, german, historian, johann, gustav, droysen, argued, that, the, conquests, of, alexander, the, great, and, creation, of, the, hellenistic, world, allowed, for, the, growth, and, establishment, of, christianity, in, the, roman, era
