https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe_Doctrine
the, monroe, doctrine, is, a, united, states, foreign, policy, position, that, opposes, european, colonialism, in, the, western, hemisphere, it, holds, that, any, intervention, in, the, political, affairs, of, the, americas, by, foreign, powers, is, a, potentially, hostile, act, against, the, united, states, the, doctrine, was, central, to, american, grand, strategy, in, the, 20th, century, president, james, monroe, first, articulated, the, doctrine, on, december, 2, 1823, during, his, seventh, annual, state, of, the, union, address, to, congress, though, it, would, not, be, named, after, him, until, 1850, at, the, time, nearly, all, spanish, colonies, in, the, americas, had, either, achieved, or, were, close, to, independence, monroe, asserted, that, the, new, world, and, the, old, world, were, to, remain, distinctly, separate, spheres, of, influence, and, thus, further, efforts, by, european, powers, to, control, or, influence, sovereign, states, in, the, region, would, be, viewed, as, a, threat, to, u, s, security, in, turn, the, united, states, would, recognize, and, not, interfere, with, existing, european, colonies, nor, meddle, in, the, internal, affairs, of, european, countries, because, the, u, s, lacked, both, a, credible, navy, and, army, at, the, time, of, the, doctrine, s, proclamation, it, was, largely, disregarded, by, the, colonial, powers, while, it, was, successfully, enforced, in, part, by, the, united, kingdom, who, used, it, as, an, opportunity, to, enforce, its, own, pax, britannica, policy, the, doctrine, was, still, broken, several, times, over, the, course, of, the, 19th, century, by, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, however, the, united, states, itself, was, able, to, successfully, enforce, the, doctrine, and, it, became, seen, as, a, defining, moment, in, the, foreign, policy, of, the, united, states, and, one, of, its, longest, standing, tenets, the, intent, and, effect, of, the, doctrine, persisted, for, over, a, century, after, that, with, only, small, variations, and, would, be, invoked, by, many, american, statesmen, and, several, american, presidents, including, ulysses, s, grant, theodore, roosevelt, john, f, kennedy, and, ronald, reagan, after, 1898, the, monroe, doctrine, was, reinterpreted, by, lawyers, and, intellectuals, as, promoting, multilateralism, and, non, intervention, in, 1933, under, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, the, united, states, affirmed, this, new, interpretation, namely, through, co, founding, the, organization, of, american, states, into, the, 21st, century, the, doctrine, continues, to, be, variably, denounced, reinstated, or, reinterpreted, despite, the, united, states, beginnings, as, an, isolationist, country, the, foundation, of, the, monroe, doctrine, was, already, being, laid, even, during, george, washington, s, presidency, according, to, s, e, morison, as, early, as, 1783, then, the, united, states, adopted, the, policy, of, isolation, and, announced, its, intention, to, keep, out, of, europe, the, supplementary, principle, of, the, monroe, doctrine, that, europe, must, keep, out, of, america, was, still, over, the, horizon, while, not, specifically, the, monroe, doctrine, alexander, hamilton, desired, to, control, the, sphere, of, influence, in, the, western, hemisphere, particularly, in, north, america, but, this, was, extended, to, the, latin, american, colonies, by, the, monroe, doctrine, but, hamilton, writing, in, the, federalist, papers, was, already, wanting, to, establish, the, united, states, as, a, world, power, and, hoped, that, it, would, suddenly, become, strong, enough, to, keep, the, european, powers, outside, of, the, americas, despite, the, fact, that, the, european, countries, controlled, much, more, of, the, americas, than, the, u, s, herself, hamilton, expected, that, the, united, states, would, become, the, dominant, power, in, the, new, world, and, would, in, the, future, act, as, an, intermediary, between, the, european, powers, and, any, new, countries, blossoming, near, the, u, s, a, note, from, james, madison, thomas, jefferson, s, secretary, of, state, and, a, future, president, to, the, u, s, ambassador, to, spain, expressed, the, american, federal, government, s, opposition, to, further, territorial, acquisition, by, european, powers, madison, s, sentiment, might, have, been, meaningless, because, as, was, noted, before, the, european, powers, held, much, more, territory, in, comparison, to, the, territory, held, by, the, u, s, although, thomas, jefferson, was, pro, french, in, an, attempt, to, keep, the, british, french, rivalry, out, the, u, s, the, federal, government, under, jefferson, made, it, clear, to, its, ambassadors, that, the, u, s, would, not, support, any, future, colonization, efforts, on, the, north, american, continent, the, u, s, government, feared, the, victorious, european, powers, that, emerged, from, the, congress, of, vienna, 1814, 1815, would, revive, monarchical, government, france, had, already, agreed, to, restore, the, spanish, monarchy, in, exchange, for, cuba, as, the, revolutionary, napoleonic, wars, 1803, 1815, ended, prussia, austria, and, russia, formed, the, holy, alliance, to, defend, monarchism, in, particular, the, holy, alliance, authorized, military, incursions, to, re, establish, bourbon, rule, over, spain, and, its, colonies, which, were, establishing, their, independence, 153, 5, great, britain, shared, the, general, objective, of, the, monroe, doctrine, and, even, wanted, to, declare, a, joint, statement, to, keep, other, european, powers, from, further, colonizing, the, new, world, the, british, feared, their, trade, with, the, new, world, would, be, harmed, if, the, other, european, powers, further, colonized, it, in, fact, for, many, years, after, the, doctrine, took, effect, britain, through, the, royal, navy, was, the, sole, nation, enforcing, it, the, u, s, lacking, sufficient, naval, capability, the, u, s, resisted, a, joint, statement, because, of, the, recent, memory, of, the, war, of, 1812, however, the, immediate, provocation, was, the, russian, ukase, of, 1821, asserting, rights, to, the, pacific, northwest, and, forbidding, non, russian, ships, from, approaching, the, coast, the, full, document, of, the, monroe, doctrine, written, chiefly, by, future, president, and, then, secretary, of, state, john, quincy, adams, is, long, and, couched, in, diplomatic, language, but, its, essence, is, expressed, in, two, key, passages, the, first, is, the, introductory, statement, which, asserts, that, the, new, world, is, no, longer, subject, to, colonization, by, the, european, countries, the, occasion, has, been, judged, proper, for, asserting, as, a, principle, in, which, the, rights, and, interests, of, the, united, states, are, involved, that, the, american, continents, by, the, free, and, independent, condition, which, they, have, assumed, and, maintain, are, henceforth, not, to, be, considered, as, subjects, for, future, colonization, by, any, european, powers, the, second, key, passage, which, contains, a, fuller, statement, of, the, doctrine, is, addressed, to, the, allied, powers, of, europe, it, clarifies, that, the, u, s, remains, neutral, on, existing, european, colonies, in, the, americas, but, is, opposed, to, interpositions, that, would, create, new, colonies, among, the, newly, independent, spanish, american, republics, we, owe, it, therefore, to, candor, and, to, the, amicable, relations, existing, between, the, united, states, and, those, powers, to, declare, that, we, should, consider, any, attempt, on, their, part, to, extend, their, system, to, any, portion, of, this, hemisphere, as, dangerous, to, our, peace, and, safety, with, the, existing, colonies, or, dependencies, of, any, european, power, we, have, not, interfered, and, shall, not, interfere, but, with, the, governments, who, have, declared, their, independence, and, maintained, it, and, whose, independence, we, have, on, great, consideration, and, on, just, principles, acknowledged, we, could, not, view, any, interposition, for, the, purpose, of, oppressing, them, or, controlling, in, any, other, manner, their, destiny, by, any, european, power, in, any, other, light, than, as, the, manifestation, of, an, unfriendly, disposition, toward, the, united, states, monroe, s, speech, did, not, entail, a, coherent, and, comprehensive, foreign, policy, it, was, mostly, ignored, until, proponents, of, the, european, non, intervention, in, the, americas, tried, to, craft, a, cohesive, monroe, doctrine, decades, later, it, was, not, until, the, mid, 20th, century, that, the, doctrine, became, a, key, component, of, american, grand, strategy, because, the, u, s, lacked, both, a, credible, navy, and, army, at, the, time, the, doctrine, was, largely, disregarded, internationally, prince, metternich, of, austria, was, angered, by, the, statement, and, wrote, privately, that, the, doctrine, was, a, new, act, of, revolt, by, the, u, s, that, would, grant, new, strength, to, the, apostles, of, sedition, and, reanimate, the, courage, of, every, conspirator, 156, the, doctrine, however, met, with, tacit, british, approval, they, enforced, it, tactically, as, part, of, the, wider, pax, britannica, which, included, enforcement, of, the, neutrality, of, the, seas, this, was, in, line, with, the, developing, british, policy, of, laissez, faire, free, trade, against, mercantilism, fast, growing, british, industry, sought, markets, for, its, manufactured, goods, and, if, the, newly, independent, latin, american, states, became, spanish, colonies, again, british, access, to, these, markets, would, be, cut, off, by, spanish, mercantilist, policy, the, reaction, in, latin, america, to, the, monroe, doctrine, was, generally, favorable, but, on, some, occasions, suspicious, john, a, crow, author, of, the, epic, of, latin, america, states, sim, n, bol, var, himself, still, in, the, midst, of, his, last, campaign, against, the, spaniards, santander, in, colombia, rivadavia, in, argentina, victoria, in, mexico, leaders, of, the, emancipation, movement, everywhere, received, monroe, s, words, with, sincerest, gratitude, crow, argues, that, the, leaders, of, latin, america, were, realists, they, knew, that, the, president, of, the, united, states, wielded, very, little, power, at, the, time, particularly, without, the, backing, of, the, british, forces, and, figured, that, the, monroe, doctrine, was, unenforceable, if, the, united, states, stood, alone, against, the, holy, alliance, while, they, appreciated, and, praised, their, support, in, the, north, they, knew, that, the, future, of, their, independence, was, in, the, hands, of, the, british, and, their, powerful, navy, in, 1826, bolivar, called, upon, his, congress, of, panama, to, host, the, first, pan, american, meeting, in, the, eyes, of, bolivar, and, his, men, the, monroe, doctrine, was, to, become, nothing, more, than, a, tool, of, national, policy, according, to, crow, it, was, not, meant, to, be, and, was, never, intended, to, be, a, charter, for, concerted, hemispheric, action, at, the, same, time, some, people, questioned, the, intentions, behind, the, monroe, doctrine, diego, portales, a, chilean, businessman, and, minister, wrote, to, a, friend, but, we, have, to, be, very, careful, for, the, americans, of, the, north, the, only, americans, are, themselves, in, spanish, america, royalist, guerrillas, continued, the, war, in, several, countries, and, spain, attempted, to, retake, mexico, in, 1829, only, cuba, and, puerto, rico, remained, under, spanish, rule, until, the, spanish, american, war, in, 1898, in, early, 1833, the, british, reasserted, their, sovereignty, over, the, falkland, islands, thus, violating, the, monroe, doctrine, no, action, was, taken, by, the, us, and, george, c, herring, writes, that, the, inaction, confirmed, latin, american, and, especially, argentine, suspicions, of, the, united, states, 171, in, 1838, 50, argentina, was, under, constant, naval, blockade, by, the, french, navy, which, was, supported, by, the, british, navy, as, such, no, action, was, undertaken, by, the, u, s, to, support, their, fellow, americas, nation, as, monroe, had, stated, should, have, been, done, for, collective, security, against, european, colonial, powers, in, 1842, u, s, president, john, tyler, applied, the, monroe, doctrine, to, hawaii, and, warned, britain, not, to, interfere, there, this, began, the, process, of, annexing, hawaii, to, the, u, s, on, december, 2, 1845, u, s, president, james, polk, announced, that, the, principle, of, the, monroe, doctrine, should, be, strictly, enforced, reinterpreting, it, to, argue, that, no, european, nation, should, interfere, with, the, american, western, expansion, manifest, destiny, in, 1861, dominican, military, commander, and, royalist, politician, pedro, santana, signed, a, pact, with, the, spanish, crown, and, reverted, the, dominican, nation, to, colonial, status, spain, was, wary, at, first, but, with, the, u, s, occupied, with, its, own, civil, war, spain, believed, it, had, an, opportunity, to, reassert, control, in, latin, america, on, march, 18, 1861, the, spanish, annexation, of, the, dominican, republic, was, announced, the, american, civil, war, ended, in, 1865, and, following, the, re, assertion, of, the, monroe, doctrine, by, the, united, states, government, this, prompted, the, spanish, forces, stationed, within, the, dominican, republic, to, extradite, back, to, cuba, within, that, same, year, in, 1862, french, forces, under, napoleon, iii, invaded, and, conquered, mexico, giving, control, to, the, puppet, monarch, emperor, maximilian, washington, denounced, this, as, a, violation, of, the, doctrine, but, was, unable, to, intervene, because, of, the, american, civil, war, this, marked, the, first, time, the, monroe, doctrine, was, widely, referred, to, as, a, doctrine, in, 1865, the, u, s, garrisoned, an, army, on, its, border, to, encourage, napoleon, iii, to, leave, mexican, territory, and, they, did, subsequently, remove, their, forces, which, was, followed, by, mexican, nationalists, capturing, and, then, executing, maximilian, after, the, expulsion, of, france, from, mexico, william, h, seward, proclaimed, in, 1868, that, the, monroe, doctrine, which, eight, years, ago, was, merely, a, theory, is, now, an, irreversible, fact, in, 1865, spain, occupied, the, chincha, islands, in, violation, of, the, monroe, doctrine, in, 1862, the, remaining, british, colonies, within, belize, merged, into, a, single, crown, colony, within, the, british, empire, and, renamed, as, british, honduras, the, u, s, government, did, not, express, disapproval, for, this, action, either, during, or, after, the, civil, war, in, the, 1870s, president, ulysses, s, grant, and, his, secretary, of, state, hamilton, fish, endeavored, to, supplant, european, influence, in, latin, america, with, that, of, the, u, s, in, 1870, the, monroe, doctrine, was, expanded, under, the, proclamation, hereafter, no, territory, on, this, continent, shall, be, regarded, as, subject, to, transfer, to, a, european, power, 259, grant, invoked, the, monroe, doctrine, in, his, failed, attempt, to, annex, the, dominican, republic, in, 1870, the, venezuelan, crisis, of, 1895, became, one, of, the, most, momentous, episodes, in, the, history, of, anglo, american, relations, in, general, and, of, anglo, american, rivalries, in, latin, america, in, particular, venezuela, sought, to, involve, the, u, s, in, a, territorial, dispute, with, britain, and, hired, former, us, ambassador, william, l, scruggs, to, argue, that, british, behaviour, over, the, issue, violated, the, monroe, doctrine, president, grover, cleveland, through, his, secretary, of, state, richard, olney, cited, the, doctrine, in, 1895, threatening, strong, action, against, great, britain, if, the, british, failed, to, arbitrate, their, dispute, with, venezuela, in, a, july, 20, 1895, note, to, britain, olney, stated, the, united, states, is, practically, sovereign, on, this, continent, and, its, fiat, is, law, upon, the, subjects, to, which, it, confines, its, interposition, 307, british, prime, minister, lord, salisbury, took, strong, exception, to, the, american, language, the, u, s, objected, to, a, british, proposal, for, a, joint, meeting, to, clarify, the, scope, of, the, monroe, doctrine, historian, george, herring, wrote, that, by, failing, to, pursue, the, issue, further, the, british, tacitly, conceded, the, u, s, definition, of, the, monroe, doctrine, and, its, hegemony, in, the, hemisphere, 307, 8, otto, von, bismarck, did, not, agree, and, in, october, 1897, called, the, doctrine, an, uncommon, insolence, sitting, in, paris, the, tribunal, of, arbitration, finalized, its, decision, on, october, 3, 1899, the, award, was, unanimous, but, gave, no, reasons, for, the, decision, merely, describing, the, resulting, boundary, which, gave, britain, almost, 90, of, the, disputed, territory, and, all, of, the, gold, mines, the, reaction, to, the, award, was, surprise, with, the, award, s, lack, of, reasoning, a, particular, concern, the, venezuelans, were, keenly, disappointed, with, the, outcome, though, they, honored, their, counsel, for, their, efforts, their, delegation, s, secretary, severo, mallet, prevost, received, the, order, of, the, liberator, in, 1944, and, abided, by, the, award, the, anglo, venezuelan, boundary, dispute, asserted, for, the, first, time, a, more, outward, looking, american, foreign, policy, particularly, in, the, americas, marking, the, u, s, as, a, world, power, this, was, the, earliest, example, of, modern, interventionism, under, the, monroe, doctrine, in, which, the, usa, exercised, its, claimed, prerogatives, in, the, americas, in, 1898, the, u, s, intervened, in, support, of, cuba, during, its, war, for, independence, from, spain, the, resulting, spanish, american, war, ended, in, a, peace, treaty, requiring, spain, to, cede, puerto, rico, the, philippines, and, guam, to, the, u, s, in, exchange, for, 20, million, spain, was, additionally, forced, to, recognize, cuban, independence, though, the, island, remained, under, u, s, occupation, until, 1902, the, big, brother, policy, was, an, extension, of, the, monroe, doctrine, formulated, by, james, g, blaine, in, the, 1880s, that, aimed, to, rally, latin, american, nations, behind, us, leadership, and, open, their, markets, to, us, traders, blaine, served, as, secretary, of, state, in, 1881, under, president, james, a, garfield, and, again, from, 1889, to, 1892, under, president, benjamin, harrison, as, a, part, of, the, policy, blaine, arranged, and, led, the, first, international, conference, of, american, states, in, 1889, the, olney, corollary, also, known, as, the, olney, interpretation, or, olney, declaration, was, united, states, secretary, of, state, richard, olney, s, interpretation, of, the, monroe, doctrine, when, the, border, dispute, for, the, essequibo, occurred, between, the, british, and, venezuelan, governments, in, 1895, olney, claimed, that, the, monroe, doctrine, gave, the, u, s, authority, to, mediate, border, disputes, in, the, western, hemisphere, olney, extended, the, meaning, of, the, monroe, doctrine, which, had, previously, stated, merely, that, the, western, hemisphere, was, closed, to, additional, european, colonization, the, statement, reinforced, the, original, purpose, of, the, monroe, doctrine, that, the, u, s, had, the, right, to, intervene, in, its, own, hemisphere, and, foreshadowed, the, events, of, the, spanish, american, war, three, years, later, the, olney, interpretation, was, defunct, by, 1933, in, 1902, canadian, prime, minister, wilfrid, laurier, acknowledged, that, the, monroe, doctrine, was, essential, to, his, country, s, protection, the, doctrine, provided, canada, with, a, de, facto, security, guarantee, by, the, united, states, the, us, navy, in, the, pacific, and, the, british, navy, in, the, atlantic, made, invading, north, america, almost, impossible, because, of, the, peaceful, relations, between, the, two, countries, canada, could, assist, britain, in, a, european, war, without, having, to, defend, itself, at, home, the, doctrine, s, authors, chiefly, future, president, and, then, secretary, of, state, john, quincy, adams, saw, it, as, a, proclamation, by, the, u, s, of, moral, opposition, to, colonialism, but, it, has, subsequently, been, re, interpreted, and, applied, in, a, variety, of, instances, as, the, u, s, began, to, emerge, as, a, world, power, the, monroe, doctrine, came, to, define, a, recognized, sphere, of, control, that, few, dared, to, challenge, before, becoming, president, theodore, roosevelt, had, proclaimed, the, rationale, of, the, monroe, doctrine, in, supporting, intervention, in, the, spanish, colony, of, cuba, in, 1898, the, venezuela, crisis, of, 1902, 1903, showed, the, world, that, the, u, s, was, willing, to, use, its, naval, strength, to, intervene, to, stabilize, the, economic, affairs, of, small, states, in, the, caribbean, and, central, america, if, they, were, unable, to, pay, their, international, debts, in, order, to, preclude, european, intervention, to, do, so, the, venezuela, crisis, and, in, particular, the, arbitral, award, were, key, in, the, development, of, the, corollary, in, argentine, foreign, policy, the, drago, doctrine, was, announced, on, december, 29, 1902, by, the, foreign, minister, of, argentina, luis, mar, a, drago, the, doctrine, itself, was, a, response, to, the, actions, of, britain, germany, and, italy, which, in, 1902, had, blockaded, venezuela, in, response, to, venezuelan, government, s, refusal, to, pay, its, massive, foreign, debt, that, had, been, acquired, under, previous, administrations, before, president, cipriano, castro, took, power, drago, set, forth, the, policy, that, no, european, power, could, use, force, against, an, american, nation, to, collect, debt, owed, president, theodore, roosevelt, rejected, this, policy, as, an, extension, of, the, monroe, doctrine, declaring, we, do, not, guarantee, any, state, against, punishment, if, it, misconducts, itself, 370, instead, roosevelt, added, the, roosevelt, corollary, to, the, monroe, doctrine, in, 1904, asserting, the, right, of, the, u, s, to, intervene, in, latin, america, in, cases, of, flagrant, and, chronic, wrongdoing, by, a, latin, american, nation, to, preempt, intervention, by, european, creditors, this, re, interpretation, of, the, monroe, doctrine, went, on, to, be, a, useful, tool, to, take, economic, benefits, by, force, when, latin, nations, failed, to, pay, their, debts, to, european, and, us, banks, and, business, interests, this, was, also, referred, to, as, the, big, stick, ideology, because, of, the, oft, quoted, phrase, from, president, roosevelt, speak, softly, and, carry, a, big, stick, 371, the, roosevelt, corollary, provoked, outrage, across, latin, america, the, roosevelt, corollary, was, invoked, to, intervene, militarily, in, latin, america, to, stop, the, spread, of, european, influence, it, was, the, most, significant, amendment, to, the, original, doctrine, and, was, widely, opposed, by, critics, who, argued, that, the, monroe, doctrine, was, originally, meant, to, stop, european, influence, in, the, americas, christopher, coyne, has, argued, that, the, addition, of, the, corollary, to, the, monroe, doctrine, began, the, second, phase, of, american, liberal, empire, and, can, be, understood, as, a, foreign, policy, declaration, based, on, military, primacy, it, initiated, a, tectonic, shift, in, the, political, and, economic, relations, between, the, united, states, and, latin, america, and, with, european, governments, other, critics, have, argued, that, the, corollary, asserted, u, s, domination, in, the, area, effectively, making, them, a, hemispheric, policeman, the, so, called, lodge, corollary, was, passed, by, the, u, s, senate, on, august, 2, 1912, in, response, to, a, reported, attempt, by, a, japan, backed, private, company, to, acquire, magdalena, bay, in, southern, baja, california, it, extended, the, reach, of, the, monroe, doctrine, to, cover, actions, of, corporations, and, associations, controlled, by, foreign, states, the, clark, memorandum, written, on, december, 17, 1928, by, calvin, coolidge, s, undersecretary, of, state, j, reuben, clark, concerned, u, s, use, of, military, force, to, intervene, in, latin, american, nations, this, memorandum, was, officially, released, in, 1930, by, the, herbert, hoover, administration, the, clark, memorandum, rejected, the, view, that, the, roosevelt, corollary, was, based, on, the, monroe, doctrine, however, it, was, not, a, complete, repudiation, of, the, roosevelt, corollary, but, was, rather, a, statement, that, any, intervention, by, the, u, s, was, not, sanctioned, by, the, monroe, doctrine, but, rather, was, the, right, of, the, u, s, as, a, state, this, separated, the, roosevelt, corollary, from, the, monroe, doctrine, by, noting, that, the, monroe, doctrine, only, applied, to, situations, involving, european, countries, one, main, point, in, the, clark, memorandum, was, to, note, that, the, monroe, doctrine, was, based, on, conflicts, of, interest, only, between, the, united, states, and, european, nations, rather, than, between, the, united, states, and, latin, american, nations, after, world,

to, international, law, in, terms, of, multilateralism, and, non, intervention, indeed, an, alternative, spanish, american, origin, of, the, idea, was, proposed, attributing, it, to, manuel, torres, however, american, leaders, were, reluctant, to, renounce, unilateral, interventionism, until, the, good, neighbor, policy, enunciated, by, president, franklin, roosevelt, in, 1933, the, era, of, the, good, neighbor, policy, ended, with, the, ramp, up, of, the, cold, war, in, 1945, as, the, united, states, felt, there, was, a, greater, need, to, protect, the, western, hemisphere, from, soviet,

said, at, an, august, 29, 1962, news, conference, the, monroe, doctrine, means, what, it, has, meant, since, president, monroe, and, john, quincy, adams, enunciated, it, and, that, is, that, we, would, oppose, a, foreign, power, extending, its, power, to, the, western, hemisphere, and, that, is, why, we, oppose, what, is, happening, in, cuba, today, that, is, why, we, have, cut, off, our, trade, that, is, why, we, worked, in, the, oas, and, in, other, ways, to, isolate, the, communist, menace, in, cuba, that, is, why, we, will, continue, to, give, a, good, deal, of, our, effort, and, attention, to, it, during, the, cold, war, the, monroe, doctrine, was, applied, to, latin, america, by, the, framers, of, u, s, foreign, policy, when, the, cuban, revolution, 1953, 1959, established,

subversion, as, in, the, case, of, operation, condor, in, the, cuban, missile, crisis, of, 1962, president, john, f, kennedy, cited, the, monroe, doctrine, as, grounds, for, the, united, states, confrontation, with, the, soviet, union, over, the, installation, of, soviet, ballistic, missiles, on, cuban, soil, the, debate, over, this, new, interpretation, of, the, monroe, doctrine, burgeoned, in, reaction, to, the, iran, contra, affair, it, was, revealed, that, the, u, s, central, intelligence, agency, had, been, covertly, training, contra, guerrilla, soldiers, in, honduras, in, an, attempt, to, destabilize, and, overthrow, the, sandinista, revolutionary, government, of, nicaragua, and, its, president, daniel, ortega, cia, director, robert, gates, vigorously, defended, the, contra, operation, in, 1984, arguing, that, eschewing, u, s, intervention, in, nicaragua, would, be, totally, to, abandon, the, monroe, doctrine, president, barack, obama, s, secretary, of, state,

mutual, partnership, with, the, other, countries, in, the, americas, is, more, in, keeping, with, monroe, s, intentions, than, the, policies, enacted, after, his, death, president, donald, trump, implied, potential, use, of, the, doctrine, in, august, 2017, when, he, mentioned, the, possibility, of, military, intervention, in, venezuela, after, his, cia, director, mike, pompeo, declared, that,

doctrine, contained, a, commitment, to, resist, further, european, colonialism, in, the, americas, it, resulted, in, some, aggressive, implications, for, american, foreign, policy, since, there, were, no, limitations, on, the, us, s, own, actions, mentioned, within, it, historian, jay, sexton, notes, that, the, tactics, used, to, implement, the, doctrine, were, modeled, after, those, employed, by,
